Dear Joe:
After practically two months of 
on-and-off thinking on the subject,
Prillaman, Food Services Director, 
Hopes To Serve the Students
Contrary to the attitude of last 
years Food Services, George W. 
Prillaman, newly appointed direc
tor of the Food Services operation, 
said Wednesday, We are here to 
serve the students, not to contain 
them. Mr. Prillamans appoint
ment represents one of the many 
changes that have taken place 
during the summer vacation as a 
result of student complaints last 
year.
Food Services controls six eat
ing facilities: cash and contract 
lines in the Skibo dining room, cat
ering services, the faculty cafe
teria, the Tartan Grill, More wood 
dining room, and Mudge.
Last year, the operation lost a 
total of $188,000. Most of the loss 
was attributed to students on con
tract feeding their non-contract 
friends. Mr. Prillaman does not 
agree with this interpretation. 
Rather, he said, food service must 
begin to operate more efficiently. 
We are not a profit making or
ganization, he said, but we 
must break even this year. That 
is my objective.
Mr. Prillaman, formerly direc
tor of Food Services at the Uni
versity of North Carolina Chapel 
Hill, arrived at C-MU August 21. 
Although, he said, the operation 
is still recovering from the loss 
of key personnel during the sum
mer months, he expects it to be in 
fairly good shape in about ten 
days. At the present time, he is 
spending his time reorganizing, 
restructuring and trying to fill va
cancies.
The first major change was 
made in the Snack Bar. A firm be
liever in student participation, he 
appointed two students, John 
Mera and George Burcin, assis
tant managers of the Grill. These 
students will be responsible for 
the Snack Bars operation from 
4:30 p.m. until closing. The grill 
closes at midnight Sunday through
Thursday and at 1 oclock Friday 
and Saturday.
Mr. Prillaman also announced 
that he has instituted several new 
accounting^ procedures to objec
tively evaluate the daily costs and 
expenditures of the operation. 
Cashiers on the contract line in 
Skibo have been instructed to ring 
up the retail costs of the food each 
student takes on his first and sub
sequent trips through the contract 
line. This procedure will enable 
him to estimate the cost per stu
dent on contract and also to get an 
idea of exactly how many stu
dents are feeding their friends. 
Although he does not expect this 
number to be large, he added that 
it is useful information to base fu
ture decisions on. He added, I 
trust studentsuntil proved other
wise.
This year, unlike last semester, 
students who only want a cup of 
coffee or a snack will be permit
ted to sit with their friends who 
are eating a full meal in the Skibo 
dining room. Last year, one had to 
purchase a meal in order to sit in 
the dining area.
Several special events are also 
being planned by Food Services. 
Mr. Prillaman cited an outdoor 
luau and Mexican dinner as some 
of the possibilities he is consider
ing.
Paper plates and plastic are 
things of the past. When you see 
anything but china in my dining 
rooms, you will know that the dish
washers did not show up, Mr. 
Prillaman said.
Other management changes are: 
Jim Cappellino has been named 
acting assistant director of Food 
Service as well as executive chef 
of Morewood Gardens and Mudge, 
and Gunther Sinsil has been ap
pointed baker-unit manager of the 
Tartan Grill.
A Student Food Service Com
mittee will be organized by Joe
Duckworth, president of Student 
Government, next week as a sub
committee of the Senate. The 
committee will meet with the ad
ministrators of Food Service to 
relay student opinions as well as 
to offer constructive criticism. 
Anyone interested in serving on 
this committee should contact the 
Student Congress Office, Skibo.
I think that Ive really put my foot 
in it this time (and you as well, 
because youre in on this thing 
too.) Not unlike any other politi
cal campaign promise, ours about 
academic reform is going to be 
very difficult to implement. First 
of all, what is academic reform? 
Obviously its got something to do 
with the scholastic angle of the 
university. Obviously its aimed 
at changing an existing situation 
and either destroying it entirely, 
or replacing it with another sit
uation.
Turning to the first obvious 
category we are obliged to deter
mine specifically what the aca
demic functions of the university 
are. Of course, this is a rather dif
ficult task, if only because all the 
functions of the university are 
supposedly subordinate to the 
academic one. That is to say, that 
any actions taken by the universi
ty should be for the benefit of its 
primary function: the instruction 
to the best of its ability of its stu
dents. Integrated into this pri
mary function: the instruction to 
the best of its ability of its stu
dents. Integrated into this pri
mary function are the subordin
ate ones of feeding, housing, and
(gulp!) entertaining its students. 
The university is therefore a sort 
of academic welfare state.
However, because it is just that 
sort of welfare institution, the uni
versity has acquired some of the 
more sinister aspects of just that 
sort of state, i.e. the impersonalization, the bureaucracy, and 
finally, the lack of any definite di
rection other than self-interest as 
an institution, and the aimless, 
begrudging acquiescence to its 
students monentary demands.
Being a welfare institution, the 
university is forced to acquire 
funds from sources other than its 
inhabitants and therefore re
ceives money from the govern
ment and industry. Government 
and industry, it may be noted, 
have no little influence on the uni
versity because without them the 
university would cease to function. 
It might be added, that if the gov
ernment and industry did net ben
efit from the existence of the uni
versity, it would cease to exist 
forthwith (the U. of California at 
Berkeley being the starring case 
in point). We therefore find the 
university answerable to these 
two prime sources of funds for the

New Policy Released
On Use of Skibo Facilities
For several years, there has 
been a growing problem surround
ing the use of campus facilities by 
both university and non-universi
ty organizations. In an effort to 
solve conflicts, the University has 
released a new policy statement 
on the use of university facilities. 
It is hoped that the new rules will 
both create more space available 
for student use and avoid the in
herent conflicts between univer
sity and non-university groups 
seeking campus space for their 
activities.
Three or four years ago, an ef
fort was made to involve the cam
pus in community affairs by al
lowing non-campus groups use of 
campus facilities for their meet
ings. It was felt that this involve
ment would be good for the uni
versity. But problems developed 
because the demand for facilities

became so great that it was hard 
to draw the line as to which group 
would be allowed the use of facil
ities and it was hard to justify de
cisions to the students that ruled 
out their activities. Robert Mc
Curdy, director of Campus Activ
ities Center, found it impossible 
to justify to the students. Pres
sure began mounting several 
years ago to reserve campus fa
cilities for students alone. Since 
Skibo is considered a campus ac
tivities center and not a student 
union, the decision was a case of 
responsibilities. Mr. McCurdy is 
willing to bend over backwards 
for students, after all, Skibo has 
some half-way decent facilities 
and they are free. We used to 
charge for setting up chairs, but 
even that has been eliminated. 
Finally, a decision was made to 
accommodate those organizations 
that were purely professional or 
academic and that could make a 
direct contribution to the univer
sity. It was a hard decision to 
make, but Mr. McCurdy felt that 
it was a necessary one.
With the new rules that have 
been drawn up. Mr. McCurdy 
hopes that now the students will 
use these facilities to accommo
date more events. He expects that 
after the new student union build
ing is opened, all student activ
ities can be centered there; Skibo 
will again be open to non-universi
ty organizations.

Editorial----
To say that the nature of the university is chang
ing is not enough for universities have always been 
changing. It is important, though, to understand that 
the changes in a university are a reflection of those 
occurring in the society. The difficulty today in de
fining the universitys situation is that it is an in
tegral part of a complex society. The Class of 
1973 is entering a more open society than any of its 
predecessors simply because it is not restricted by 
the binds of a definition.
If the university is therefore in a state of flux, 
not yet decayed but desperately in need of reform, 
then the situation will become what we choose to 
make it. This is the challenge that students today 
must face. There is not reason to be pessimistic about 
the ability of the university to accept change.
Since the university reflects the society in which 
we live, and since there are many disturbing forces 
within society, it is understandable why there may be 
pessimism about the ability of the university to ac
cept change. It is certainly true that universities are 
often held back by virtue of their public role. The ogvernment, foundations, alumni, critics, the press and 
public opinion all exercise their power and attempt to 
impose their will on an institution of which they know 
only parts. Competition for scarce money, necessary 
to the survival of the university, has often forced 
administrations to compromise with influences that 
they may not, in principle, agree with. But, realizing 
that we are also a part of the society which is exert
ing these forces then there is no reason to be pessi
mistic.
The situation at C-MU last year illustrates this 
point. Students, realizing that we are an integral 
part of the society, began to be concerned with the 
fact that the university should reflect their interests. 
For a while we were not certain how these demands 
would be met. Had these problems been handled dif
ferently we may have had a riot.
But C-MU is a public relations mans dream. 
There are 20 violent confrontations daily on uni
versity campuses across the country; we, fortunate
ly, have not become part of this statistic. Although 
many were discouraged by the long discussions, many 
more were encouraged by the results. Tangible dif
ferences, such as students participating in curricu
lum changes and trustee meetings, can be set forth 
as examples of the effectiveness of reasonable and 
open communication.
This year, hopefully, the picture is an optimistic 
one. We are more concerned with finding the causes 
of dissatisfaction than issuing ultimatums. Now that 
we have proven to ourselves that we are fortunate in 
having an administration that is willing to listen, to 
act, to compromise, we must take advantage of this 
unique opportunity. If it is the responsibility of the ad
ministration to respond to students suggestions, then 
it is also the responsibility of the student to evaluate 
his experience and determine what is valuable and 
what needs change. As reported in Michael Armentrouts letter on the front page of this issue, if we are 
able to improve the C-MU curriculum we may not 
see the results, but we have made an important con
tribution and investment in the futurea future we 
all share.

Letter to the Editor
Editor, The Tartan:
As you probably well know, 
Mens Dorm Council plans to con
tinue the film serires which has 
shown such great popularity these 
last several years. This year we 
plan to have fewer films, but the 
quality of these has been greatly 
increased. So as to allow more 
people from the campus commun
ity to view those which we do have, 
a douxle showing of each feature 
will be made.
This year, we would also like to 
increase our publicity for our 
series. We feel that if more peo
ple are informed, our crowds will 
increase. Hopefully, dorm movies 
will no longer be the place to go 
when there is nothin else to do!

and social aspects of usage; they 
are a statement of concern  
which will, hopefully, lead to 
more interest and study of the ^ 
problems on all college campuses.
The stimulant and depressant 
drugs are being consumed at an 
appalling rate on urban campuses 
and in high schools, and yet the 
public is entirely unaware of their 
very vicious and dangerous na
ture, says former Committee 
Chairman Kim Masters. Everyg, 
one supposes that these drugs are 
harmless in comparison with 
more widely publicized drugs, 
while in fact, just the opposite is 
true.
The addiction to barbituates is 
more severe for most people than 
an addiction to heroin, says the 
Committee. When used with al
cohol, the barbituates may pro
duce a high similar to alcoholic 
intoxication, or if the user is un
lucky, the mixture may cause 
death.
Amphetamines, the wake-up 
drugs, may produce a feeling of 
increased confidence, euphoria, 
and a loss of appetite as well as 
wakefulness. But the report goes 
on to cite an extreme case of ef
fect of dexedrine; A girl who had 
used dexedrine to stay awake all 
night so she could study for an ex
amination wrote what she thought 
was a magnificent essay. In fact, 
she had written for three hours 
over and over on the same line.
Psychedelics and the College 
Student has sold over 30,000 
copies since its publication in Sep
tember, 1967. The colleges, on 
whose campuses drug use has 
spr rapidly, should take a 
much more active role in increas
ing the amount of information 
available, and when the time 
comes, of evaluating that infor
mation in terms of the legal struc
ture, concludes the booklet.

A.W.S.--Communication and Change
Friday, September 5, 1969THE TARTANPage 3
fy
iJ
Today, when there seem to be 
so many reasons for discontent in 
the nations universities, it is evi
dent aht good communication be
tween administration and stu
dents is imperative. The wo
men students in this university 
have an organization which pro
vides a central place for the ex
change of ideas and serves as an 
excellent channel of communica
tion between the women stu
dents and administration. The or
ganization is the Associated Wo
men Students, or A.W.S., and is 
composed of both commuters 
and dormitory residents.
A.W.S. is divided into two 
governing bodies: the Executive 
Board and the Judicial Board. 
The Executive Council may dis
cuss and create rules for the wo
men students. AWS is open to pe
tition concerning suggestions 
and complaints from any outside 
group on issues which affect the 
residence hall or the women stu
dents. These are handled with
in our A.W.S. Executive Council 
meetings and are then put into 
effect for undergraduate women in 
the residence halls. Those ideas 
which necessitate administrative 
decision are discussed in our 
meetings where recommendations 
are composed and then sent to the 
appropriate administrative of
fice. In most cases A.W.S. recom
mendations merit prompt con
sideration and response from these 
offices so that action is im
mediate.
Some of the changes that have 
resulted from A.W.S. in recent 
years included revision and exten
sion of curfews for freshmen wo
men elimination of curfews for 
upperclass women, extension of 
off-campus housing privileges, and 
the extension of open house 
policy in Morewood Gardens 
and the Woodlawn and E-Tower Apartments.
Highlands 
Named Head of 
Architecture
Delbert Highlands, 34-year-old

Mr. Highlands, who earned his
B.A. and M.A. in architecture 
here in 1958 and 1960, has been 
active in painting as well as in 
architecture. His work has ap
peared in several exhibitions, 
and in 1968 won the Jury Award 
for Distinction in Painting at the 
annual exhibition of the Associa
ted Artists of Pittsburgh. Also, a 
recipient of prizes for work in 
architecture, Mr. Highlands has 
been a designer and design con

Black Construction Coalition 
Continues Negotiations
Construction resumed on ma
jor jobs within the city after a 
five day cooling off period. 
Simultaneously, negotiations be
tween the Master Builders As
sociation and the Black Construc
tion Coalition, the major dispu
ting parties, commenced on the 
issue which caused the shutdown.
Last week more than 200 per
sons were arrested as thousands 
marched daily protesting discrim
inatory practices of the various 
construction unions in Pitts
burgh. Traffic was disrupted, ten
sion was high and several in
stances of violence were report
ed with injuries occuring to de
monstrators, workers, and police.
Of 26 construction unions in 
the city, only one, the Laborers 
Union, has any significant repre
sentation of Blacks. Four have 
no Black membership at all and 
high ranking officials of at least 
one have declared that they are 
opposed to the admission of any 
Black craftsmen.
At issue is the BCCs demand 
that Blacks be admitted to train
ing and apprenticeship programs 
and that qualified Black work
ers be accorded full union mem
bership.
Construvtion is planned or in 
progress on each university cam
pus within the city. At the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, construc
tion is in progress at the Bennedum Engineering Building and 
University Health Center. These 
jobs total $14.5 million. Addition
ally, plans are nearing final ap
proval for the controversial Chem
istry Building slated to cost $12 
million. Construction is schedul
ed to start in February.
Chatham College is planning 
construction of a LibraryStu
dent Center that will cost in ex
cess of $3-million.
Construction is underway at

(Continued from Page 1)
action of the university in general. 
(And now if you will permit me to 
deviate for an instant with a brief 
historical note:
When most universities were 
conceived in the United States, be 
in 200 or ten years ago, they 
were conceived with the notion 
that their students would be re
ceiving a general philosophical ed
ucation, commonly called the lib
eral Arts Education. Within this 
structure, students were sup
posed to work dilignetly in a varie
ty of fields, then seizing upon a 
certain degree of interest, pursue 
that subject more intensively, but 
not wholly neglecting the others. 
CIT, on the other hand, was con
ceived with the express idea of 
providing professional educa
tion to students who would then go 
on and work in specific areas of 
industry where they were sorely 
needed. The paradox of all this is 
that today most universities are 
practicing the CIT formula while 
professing to be adherents of the 
Liberal Arts. C-MU on the other 
hand is supposedly trying to move 
away from its early aims, and be
come liberal.
This leads me into the second 
obvious category: reform. Re
form is a very nice word because 
it doesnt really mean anything 
but it sounds like youre doing 
something. A classic example of 
this is the Reformation where a 
lot of Protestants got together and 
decided that the church wasnt 
running so good so theyd change 
it. The ultimate result was that
things stayed pretty much the 
same, except there were now a 
myriad of little religious groups 
and they fought a war for a hun
dred years over it.
What Im saying is that aca
demic reform as applied to our 
particular university situation is 
no change at all when viewed on 
the national scale. That is to say, 
whereas in the past CIT was pro
viding canon-fodder for indus
try, C-MU will still be doing the 
same, only theyll call it Liberal 
Arts.
So, the big question remains, 
what am I, as temporarily perma
nent director of the Academic Af
fairs Board, and you the Right 
Honorable Joe Duckworth, presi
dent of the student boy; what are 
we going to do about this deplor
able situation. Well, pardon me 
for being my usual cynical self, 
but I rather imagine that were 
not going to do anything about it. I 
say that because the majority of 
our peers are perfectly content to 
be winging their ways toward $15,-
000 a year, draft-deferable jobs. I 
hardly blame them, Id like to find 
one myself. However, after ten 
years in such a job, how many of 
them are still going to be (provid
ing they ever were) interesting, 
intelligent people. I would venture 
to say not a hell of a lot of them. 
The reason (blast of trumpets) is 
because they have no philosophic
al background to fall back on. in 
effect, they never received a 
philosophical education (see his
torical note).
I may be simplifying the prob
lem, I am simplifying the prob
lem enormously, xut since 1 have 
the benefit of an uninterrupted
one-way conversation  with a 
problem like the one we are facing, 
it is necessary to give everybody 
what they want, and still get what 
we (I) want. Okay. What does ev
erybody want? Well they all want 
to get good jobs, but they all want 
interesting jobs. Of course, whats 
one mans means is another mans 
poison (in effect theres no ac
counting for taste), but obviously 
the idea of the professional ed
ucation is here tostay, thanks to 
our high standard of living, etc. 
However, nobody wants to be the 
man in the gray flannel suit even 
if they happen to already be wear
ing one mentally. Therefore, the 
benefit of all concerned, I believe 
that the professional students 
should be allowed to broaden their 
fields of interest without being 
obliged to suffer in their profes
sional courses. I dont think Ill 
find too much argument on that 
one. This will let them more easi
ly function as people even if they 
are still machines. I think this is 
a primary immediate goal which 
can be tendered in the direction 
of administration, faculty, etc.
However, I think our real aim is 
to get the university to clarify its 
goals for the future. That is to 
say, why don't we try to wring out 
of President Stevers gray flannel 
head specific aims for, say, the 
next five years. (That will give 
present freshmen the time to nail 
him if he doesn't fulfill his obliga
tions. ) This should be an interest
ing task because like most Ameri
can institutions, including the gov
ernment. they live hand-to-mouth 
(i.e., nothing is ever done until a 
situation reaches a crisis).
Taking the crisis idea, we can 
force Stever into thinking that 
things have reached a crisis in as 
much as the students can no long
er support living from crisis-tocrisis. Stever then draws up his 
Five Year Plan, and everytime 
another commitment comes due, 
for him its a crisis. (I hope you 
follow that because I think its 
fairly simple.)
Now looking from Stevers point 
of view, Just how the hell am I 
going to find out what needs to be 
done in the next five years?
Well, President Stever, we 
say, Why don't you set up another 
committee to look into the mat
ter." Which, of course, he imme
diately does with Kibbee and 
Thomas and Swank and Ron Haan 
and yourself and God only knows 
who else. And naturally this com
mittee meets once a month, and 
everyone scratches their heads 
and talks about Skibo and physical 
educationand Stever relaxes 
once again, and the whole thing 
fades away into the Pittsburghian 
haze. And the university runs 
around in circles as usual because 
theres nobody at the helm who 
knows what direction to steer it 
in.
I dont know what direction ei
ther. But I'd feel a damn sight bet
ter to going somewhere, than to be 
going in circles. So, instead of say
ing, Let's have a committee," I 
think we should say. Lets have 
an evaluation." Now when I talk 
about an evaluation, I don't mean
1) Filling in IBM cards which 
grade your teachers from blackto-white, and intermediate gray
2) Student Advisory Commit
tees, 3) The ranking of the univer
sity as opposed to other universi
ties, 4) Mass self-confession by 
ranking revisionists within the 
university chardres a la Chinese. 
What I mean is to drag in some 
people who know something about 
education; some people who work 
in the industries which benefit 
from the employment of our grad
uates, maybe even (perish the 
thought) some students from other 
universities, and let them dig into 
the innards of our campus and 
formulate critiques of whats go
ing on, or not going on here. 
These people should be briefed be
forehand by an impartial group of 
university inhabitants, and be 
left to formulate their individual 
reports for whatever length of 
of time they see fit. What I would 
like to see come out of this is an 
impartial appraisal of the univer
sity upon which appropriate steps 
can be taken. I might add that 
without such an evaluation I see 
little hope of 1) Any appropri
ate steps ever being taken, and
2) of ever being able to see just 
where the next foot is going to be 
placed.
I might add that if Id made 
such an evaluation of the situa
tion beforehand Id never have 
put my foot in it like I did.

There is much written and said 
about our Army and about our po
lice system. Consider two recent 
articles.
The first is from the August 25 
issue of Newsweek and it con
cerns the Green Beret Scandal. 
Forty-three year old Col. Robert 
B. Rheault, former commander 
of all Berets in Vietnam, was ar
rested along with seven other Ber
ets on suspision of premeditated 
murder. The man killed, Chuyen 
Khac, was a Vietnamese who 
served as a United States intelli
gence agent.
According to Newsweek, Rhe
ault denied any guilt, saying, in a 
letter to his father, I have done 
nothing to be ashamed of  as a 
commander, as a soldier, or as a 
man. He was not asked if he had, 
indeed, done it!
We read occasionally of U. S. 
assassinations, but the majority 
of the general populus does not 
believe them. Operation Phoenix 
appeared to be a wholesale assas
sination aimed at reducing NLF 
support in South Vietnam. This is 
another such case where, since 
something had gone wrong, some
one, Rheault, was jeopardized.
From Newsweek: . , some
elements of the case seemed rea
sonably wyell established. . . Some
time in June, Chuyen was arrest
ed and interrogated by the Green 
Berets. Evidence was presented 
... to show that the man was a 
traitor. Then the Berets went to
the CIA and received an order to 
kill Chuyen. They deny this order. 
In any case, on June 20, Chuy
en was shot, stuffed into a weight
ed sack, and dropped into the 
South China Sea, somewhere off 
the city of Nha Trang where Rheaults Fifth Special Forces Group 
had its headquarters. But it soon 
appeared that the CIA did not, in 
fact, want Chuyen killed. The 
eight Berets became scapegoats.
The eight are not guiltythey 
were only following orders. 
The order to kill? The CIA is not 
guilty  they simply made a mis
take (and deny it). Who is guilty? 
I propose that everyone is guilty 
who lets this happen without in
tense questioning.
The article contained a picture 
of a civilian being questioned at 
knifepoint. We can imagine the 
pictures that the newsmen were 
not allowed to take!
The second article appeared in 
The Guardian. It concerxhe na
tional convention of the Fraternal 
Order of Police in Louisville, Ky. 
President Harrington was relected to his fifth and sixth years as 
the head of the organization. He 
is well remembered from Phila
delphia and his opposition to the 
concept of a civilian review board 
for police and for his support of 
Wallace for President.
The convention proposed a full
investigation of the Black Panth
er Party, SDS, and otjer radoca, 
groups. President Harrington 
called for a voice vote. The ayes 
responded loudly at which time 
Harrington said, And all those 
opposed ought to get the hell out 
of here. (Thats the way, Pres. 
Go get them radicals who dont 
support Democracy the way you 
do!)
Harrington concluded by nam
ing Wallace an honorable states
man and by stating the police 
work today is just like trying to 
hold back a wave in the ocean. It 
just cant be done. (Another of 
Harringtons overwhelming dis
plays of democratic support! )

Freshman Cabinet: Frosh Action
Draft Resistance Opens Office
As part of a nationwide move
ment, Pittsburgh Draft Resis
tance continues to grow, both in 
its programs of opposition to the 
war and the draft as well as in a 
variety of related areas. In order 
to carry on these programs, an of
fice has been opened at 3406 
Fifth Ave., Room 304.
Not only will the office serve as 
a place which to coordinate the 
programs and activities of resis
tance, emigration laws, political 
issues involved with the draft, and 
lawyers who are available to help 
with legal questions of the draft. 
It is a place where people can be 
found who know the draft law. In
formation on the war, the draft, 
and resistance is available, cur
rent, amtextensive.
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance be
gan on December 4, 1967, when a 
group of young men and their sup
porters met to give witness to 
their choice of total non-coopera
tion with the military and its agen
cy of human procurement, the Se
lective Service System.
It was the hope of some that re
sisting in the most public, direct 
way possible would force the na
tion to reverse its present actions. 
Other chose to resist as an at
tempt to preserve in themselves 
the decency and humanity which 
they feel is so lacking today.
What problems do freshmen see 
on campus? How would they like

Goodbye Columbus is the film version of the National Book Award win
ner by Philip Roth (author of Portnoys Complaint). Roth wrote Goodbye Col
umbus, perhaps his most popular work, at the age of 26. Written for the screen 
by Arnold Schulman (A Hole in the Head and Love with the Proper Stranger), 
the story is one that portrays everyday life with astonishing realism. Humor and 
bite are successfully rendered in all areas of moral and social valuation in this 
picture of two young people. They are Neil, a youth of little means in his early 
twenties, working as a librarian and to some extent alienated from society, and 
Brenda, a college student whose affluent parents have spoiled and pampered 
her. Her attraction to Neil is heightened by his refusal to cater to her self-cen
tered needs. The film is also the story of Brendas parents, the Patimkins, whose 
place in the Jewish society was earned through hard work and the accumulation 
of wealth. For the Patimkins, the most important things in life are financial se
curity and social status.

G.C. could not have been filmed in a more appropriate location than 
New York and Weschester County to capture the desired levels of American 
Jewish society. The arora is one of a many-sided comedy.
Goodbye Columbus is a fantastic experience. Now playing in the Squirrel 
Hill area, I recommend it, not only as an exciting photographic essay, but as an 
up-to-date fil with poignancy and clever distinction.This piece of America on film is sensitive and wonderfully cast. Two of

Intramural Sports
The 1969-70 Intramural Sports program gets underway 
later this month with touch football, co-rec badminton, and 
tennis leading the way. Once again, twenty-seven activities 
are scheduled plus the annual IM Night early in March. At 
that time trophies for winners of completed events are awarded. ------------------------------
All registered day students and 
faculty members are eligible for 
competition provided they fill out 
an official roster sheet and return 
it to the Intramural Office on or 
before the date listed. A $2.50 for
feit fee, returnable at the end of 
the season provided the team 
shows up ready to play each 
game, must accompany each en
try. The Intramural Department 
will provide all needed equipment, 
including rules and regulations 
governing the activity.
The minimum and maximum 
number of players which a team 
can enter on one roster is deter
mined by the IM Board. Teams 
may be formed by any group of 
students. Last year twelve frater
nities, twenty-five dorm and in
dependent groups, and fifteen 
Grad and faculty teams competed 
in the various sports.
Three separate but related stu
dent organizations play and run the 
program, with the supervision 
and advice of Earl J Birdy, 
Director of Mens Intramural 
Athletics.
The Intramural Board is the 
governing body of the program. It 
rules over all disputes that arise 
during a scheduled season, such
as forfeits and protests.
 The IM Managers Club is 
the representative body of com
peting organizations in the pro
gram. Part of its job is to provide 
a link between the participants 
in the program and the Board. It 
also chooses commissioners for 
each sport.
 The Officials Club pro
vides and schedules officials 
for all IM sports requiring offi
ciating and instructs in rules 
and officiating techniques. Each 
team participating in a sport must 
supply one official. They are 
paid $1.25 per contest.
Managers Club meetings are 
held the first and third Tuesday 
of each month at the Black Cat 
Lounge in the gymnasium build
ing. All groups fielding a team 
should send a representative. The 
first meeting is this Tuesday at 
12:30.
For further information check 
the IM Bulletin Board in the 
Gym or contact either Mr. Birdy 
or Harold Herre, President of the 
Intramural Board. Copies of the 
schedule and the IM Constitu
tion are available in the IM Of

Women's Athletic Program 
Expanded For Fall Semester
Among the many clubs enlisting freshman support at 
the Activities Fair on Tuesday was WARA, the Womens 
Athletic and Recreation Association. Even though oriented to
ward the women on campus, it is offering two co-educational 
programs. Men are able to join the newly formed Fencing 
Club as well as the C-MU synchronized swim club, Tarquans.
Both intramural and varsity 
clubs will be available to C-MU 
women. One of the interscholastic 
level there will be field hockey, 
tennis, and competitive swimming 
offered the first half of the fall
semester. Vollyball will begin la
ter in October. Basketball, bad
minton, and softball are on the 
slate for second semester. These 
clubs compete with various 
area colleges such as Pitt, Chat*
Grid Squad Shapes Up
Head football coach Joe Gasparella has a squad of 32 players, including 15 lettermen, on 
hand as the Tartans continue practice for the season opener September 27 against Thiel. The 
Tartans will play three home games and five road contests in an effort to improve on last 
seasons creditable 4-3-1 record.
Gasparella has the nucleus of a strong team but is faced with his annual lack of 
depth problem which he hopes will be partially solved by the development of some of the 
thirteen freshmen currently listed on the roster.
The returning veterans include 
Tony Bugel, a fine tight end. 
Bugel, along with three-year vet
eran Denny Morabito, an offen
sive guard, will serve as co-captains this season. Other returning 
linemen include Ken Buzzard, 
Paul Zugates, Denny Doran, Dick 
Helhowski, Gary Meilahn, Scott 
Calvert and John Slatosky.
The CMU ground game prom
ises to te the strongest it has 
been in years. Halfback Tom 
Lombardo, of Central Catholic, 
gained almost 500 years in his 
first season and averaged over 
four yeards per carry. The other 
running back will be Terry Bell, 
a transfer student who was in
eligible last season. He picked 
up over 90 yeards in the Alumni 
game last spring. Terry is a 
brother of Dick Bell, a 1967 gradu
ate who holds practically all of 
CMUs pass receiving records.
Rich Squires, who as a fresh
man completed 113 passes for 
1600 yards and 18 touchdowns, 
is back at quarterback. However, 
his favorite receiver, Joe Chernay, has graduatedMeaving the 
Tartans only one experienced wide 
receiver, senior Rudy Tepsic. 
Freshman Charles Price, from 
Murrysville, is also being ser
iously considered for the flanker 
position.
Junior John Dzura, a returning 
letterman, will replace Larry Getto at Middle linebacker. Other 
experienced defensive players 
will see action include juniors Ed 
Dumont and Bill Halstead.
Among the first year players 
to whom Gasparella is looking 
for help are Art Hunkele, a guard 
from North Catholic; John Sabol, 
offensive center from Uniontown; defensive halfbacks Rich
ard Miller from Mt. Lebanon and 
Chris OLeary from Wilkensburg; 
and linebacker Ray Terza, from 
Duquesne.
The opening game of the sea
son is at home on Saturday, Sep
tember 27 at 1:30 p.m. The visit
ing Thiel Tomcats defeated Tech 
in last years opener, 42-20, but 
its a new season.
by Jerry Siskind
Rich Squires, sophomore quarterback for the Tartans, gets his arm 
into shape for the season. Rich will have good backfield support 
with fullback Terry Bell and halfback Tom Lombardo.
