PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 1909TEN CENTS
ENGLANDS VARSITY BOAT RACE.
Oxford Versus Cambridge.
The Oxford-Cambridge race is the great race 
in England, and is rowed just above London be
tween Putney and Mortlake. Those who live on 
the Thames, within the four-and-a-half-mile course, 
build terraced seats at the back of .their gardens, 
and invite their friends to enjoy the excitement. 
If there is no garden (but there usually is in Eng
land), they look out of the rear windows, or climb 
up on the roofs, or occupy the boats and barges 
moored along the shore. This race is one of the 
events of the season, and when it is over the guests 
are invited to have something to eat, as the Eng
lish express itwhich means that, upon entering 
the house, one finds, in several rooms, tables spread 
with the most interesting and appetizing viands, 
beginning with soup or coffee and sandwiches, and 
ending with delicious fruit salads, dainty cakes, and 
various things made with whipped cream.
It is a proverbial saying that it either rains or 
snows on boat race day, but this year the day was 
one of the sunniest of Englands delightful spring. 
The wind was dead East and somewhat biting in 
the morning, but became quite still by noon, in time 
for the starting.
Much excitement was expected, for Oxford had 
been improving with tremendous strides recently, 
and two weeks ago had covered the course in 18 
minutes. 21 seconds (though tide and wind were
phenomenal). This was the record since 1899, 
which was 18 minutes, 27 seconds. The Oxford 
men, however, were considered a bit rough in 
comparison with Cambridges welRrained crew, and 
Stuart, the Cambridge stroke, was known to have 
a very magnetic personality which had carried his 
men to victory for three successive years. He was 
also the stroke in the Harvard game two years ago. 
Browne, the Oxford stroke, was considered very in
experienced, never having raced before, and not 
only that, but he was likely to lose his form after 
the first mile, and become erratic, and late on his 
menlikewise short at the finish, and exceed
ingly difficult to follow. Stuarts little game had 
always been to get the lead in the first mileget 
right away, as they say here, in order to slightly 
dishearten his opponents, and victory had been the 
result each time for three years. But this year the 
Oxford crew were likely to live with them for the 
first mile, and if their remarkable staying quality 
made them race well after Hammersmith, Cam
bridge would have to look to their laurels.
Cambridge was the favoritethat was plain from 
the predominance of the light blue. The usual penants with the college letter on (as they say here), 
was nowhere to be seen and never had been seen,
I found upon inquiry. On the streets, near the 
course, hawkers were selling blue tissue-paper

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
carnations, blue bows, miniature oars crossed, and 
tied with blue ribbon. Then there were blue beads, 
blue jumping jacks, blue fly-shakes (I dont know 
what else they would be)made of inch strips of 
blue paper and tied to a stickbut the novel things 
were Scotch caps with streamers, and also large 
hats of crepe paper with wide flounces with which 
the venders had adorned themselves, and looked 
very grotesque. All these wonders were a penny 
each.
Baby blue is the Cambridge color, and navy 
blue is Oxfords.
The river banks were black with people, who had 
come by thousands, in omnibuses, tram-cars (elec
trics) in smart vehicles in taxi-s, in motors and 
in the trains of the Underground to anywhere.
Various craft steamed up the river for a coign of 
vantage at the finishing point, Mortlake. All bore 
the blues at the bow, and the Jack astern. 
Shortly before the starting gun, a white barge ap
peared bearing tae familiar words, votes for 
women, one of the suffragettes, as figure-head, 
waving their large tri-colored flag in response to 
hearty cheers from the banks. According to their 
customary enterprise there was an announcement 
of their next meeting at Royal Albert Hall.
The toss-up was in Cambridges favor, and they 
chose the inside course nearest the Surrey bank. 
The start was even, and each crew rowed 39. 
strokes in the first minute, though Cambridge put 
in eleven strokes to Oxford's ten in the first quar
ter. Cambridges second stroke was not up to par, 
and this gave Oxford a slight lead, which was, how
ever, wiped out a bit farther on. Stuart brisked 
upon the stroke at this point, but Browne was 
Johnny on the spot. Stuart was trying his usual 
trick of getting ahead on the first miletrying to 
get away, but Browne held his own, and Stuart 
appeared to be getting a bit short. Thus they 
struggled for the lead, and the shores rang with 
excited cheers. First one gainedthen the other 
crept ahead. Neither seemed able to assert supe
riority. At the mile post Cambridge was just lead
ing and was soon helf a length ahead.
Then the struggle began in dead earnest; Browne, 
with extraordinary determination, answered Stuart 
pull for pull, and Oxford began to overhaul their 
opponents. The excitement on the banks was tre
mendous. Oxford leads, went up the shouts, and 
a length ahead darted the dark blues. With dash 
and rythm the light blues pushed on, and began to
draw up. To those, seeing them for the first time, 
as they appeared in .the distance around the bend 
and under the Hammersmith bridge, men and oar 
blades gleaming white in the sun. It was a spec
tacle to be remembered.
Tugs and the judges boat were following at a 
lively pace, in their turn plowing up the water which 
caught the brilliant light. On they came, Cam
bridge a bit ahead with this bend in their favor 
and rowing about 32 to Oxfords 33. Bourne was 
pushing Cambridge; that was evident. Stuart 
couldnt get his customary 'breather at this point, 
for Bourne was at his heels, or rather wouldnt let 
him get ahead in the least. He held him, and it 
was now or never for the light blues. As they 
passed us at the Dores Bindery they were neck and 
neck, both crews rowing as one man. Oxford, Ox
ford, roared the banks, for Oxford was gaining. 
With the strength and judgment of a veteran, 
Bourne held his men, and they were putting power 
with every stroke. 'Cambridge was hard put to 
it. The Light Blues were looking to their laurels. 
Bourne was eyeing the Cambridge stroke, and from 
the banks and launches came storms of cheers. 
It was the race of a life-time, runs one account in 
an English paper. The excitement ran almost to 
fever pitch. The cries of encouragement to both 
crews* were positively deafening. Now, indeed, it 
was becoming a Homeric struggle and crews and 
onlookers, onlookers and crews, were one in the 
glorious delirium of the sporting battle beloved of 
Englishmen.
Near the end of the course, when both eights 
were straightening for the last lapthe Oxford men 
quickened. They were definitely creeping ahead 
and Cambridge could not answer them. At a 
breathless moment the Oxford cox pulled across in 
front of Cambridge, and had Cambridge an ounce 
of ginger left they would have been a narrow 
escape of a foul. The light blues had rowed a 
gallant race, but there was fierce joy in the clear 
eye of Borne when he saw the blessed daylight 
widening, and widening between him and the broad 
back of Cambridge Prow. Just then three in the 
Oxford boat nearly caught a crab. There was a 
nasty lurch, and those on the launches held their 
breath. The men pulled themselves together, how
ever, and were none the worse off, for Cambridge 
was done. In fact both crews were dead rowed 
out.
Oxford is said in the last 17 days to have ac

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN5
quired the bed-rock rudiments of rowing. It was a 
magnificent win.
A few minutes later the judges boat steamed 
back down the river bearing the dark blue pennant 
above the light one, and those who were disap
pointed, made the best of it with true English forti
tude, and really thought it would be stupid if Cam
bridge won too consecutively.
Just as we were leaving our seats what should we 
see iioating high in the heavens but an old-fashioned 
balloon of larger proportions, bearing again in 
enormous letters the words Votes for Women.
But the great event to follow the race was the 
dinner at the Grand Hotel in Trafalgar Square, 
and later the men were to see themselves in the 
race from start to finish on the screen at the 
Empire Theatre. As they entered respectively the 
six boxes which had been reserved for them the 
theatre rang with cheersa tremendous outburst 
greeted them and other forms of demonstrative 
welcome, to quote the English phraseology. The 
crew was greatly interested to see themselves row
ing their own race as it appeared on the Cinematograph.
Meanwhile the undergraduates, according to their 
custom, were ragging about town, especially in the 
West End, getting themselves disliked by the Bob
bies.
At eleven oclock, when people were leaving the 
theatres and music halls, Leicester Square became 
filled with a surging throng of undergraduates and 
others, who were chiefly concerned with finding ovit 
what was happening. Nothing was happening ex
cept the shouts of Oxford andCambridge, but 
they soon gathered crowds of thousands, and the 
far-famed English police had a good opportunity to 
live up to their reputations. They had a lively time 
to keep the streets open, for traffice was being held 
up. A little laterabout midnightthere was some 
rather pronounced rowdyism, which resulted in 
the usual crop of boat race charges to be dealt 
with at Marleborough street jail on Monday.
Some of Englands most famous menat West
minster, on the Bench, and in the Church have at 
some time rowed for their Varsity. The Right 
Honorable R. McKenna, M. P. (first Lord of the 
Admiralty), Rev. J. J. Hornby, D.D. (provost of 
Eton), Rev. Herbert Kynaston, 'Canon of Durham, 
etc., etc. The latter writes an interesting bit about 
his race fifty years ago. He says:  a boisterous 
wind raged and waves soon began to fill the boat.
The oarsmen were drenched, and their hands almost 
numb with coldand yet the race had to be rowed. 
They caught crabs and other awful things happened 
and it took 25 minutes, 50 seconds.
But the same spirit holds to-day in the British 
heart, and this year's race was called one of the 
most thrilling races in years.
ALFRED EASTS LECTURE.
About noon on Friday, word was passed around 
that Mr. Alfred East, the famous English artist, 
who was a member of the art jury of the Institute 
this year, would give us a lecture in the Applied 
Science Assembly Hall at 3.30. It was about the 
worst time that could have been chosen to have a 
lecture on such short notice. When the time came 
the Hall was well filled, with quite a number of the 
Margaret Morrison girls present.'
The Director, in introducing him, referred to his 
work as one of the jury of the international exhibi
tion, spoke of having met him last year in London, 
and stated that the European views on Art origi
nated largely with Mr. East.
The true greatness of the man can be in some 
way appreciated by his first two words; they were, 
Fellow students. Stating that Dr. Hamerschlag 
had placed him in an embarrassing situation by 
lauding his work and that he was a painter and not 
a public speaker, he proceeded to tell us in a direct 
way that was very much to the point, something of 
the relationship of Fine Art to life. Modern Art 
reaches beyond the ordinary expression of opinion, 
for, you know, Art is but an expression of opinion. 
I think that in Fine Art a man should express 
himself as he feels; not in the letter of the pastmasters, but rather in their spirit. Take out the 
art from our lives, and men should become but ani
mals.- Now, I believe that the ornament of any 
structure should be but to emphasize the strength 
of it, if it is an engineering work; if it does not it 
fails. Art finds its maximum expression by the 
minimum of means.
Speaking, then, more particularly of his own 
work as a landscape painter, he' mentioned an inci
dent of criticising a pupils work, who had slightly 
re-arranged the details of the landscape on his can
vas to suit his own purpose. Why tell all these 
little lies in your picture? If you must tell them at 
all, why not make it one big onea masterly one? 
If all pictures were just like Nature, there would 
be no artists.
He expressed himself as very much pleased with 
our schools, and spoke briefly of the difference be
tween it and the ones in England, and judging from 
Mr. Easts opinions, we have cause to feel quite 
flattered. It was a great privilege to hear him.

M. M. C. S.
We wish to express our thanks for the interest in 
this page displayed by the students of the other 
schools. It is certainly gratifying to have our ef
forts so keenly appreciated, but to furnish the in
spiration for immortal poems is more than we had 
dared to hope for in our most ambitious moments. 
For the kind explanation of the possible meaning 
of our sometimes ambiguous English, and for the 
gratuitous contributions to our column, we thank 
you.
Miss Fisher (in English)Miss Benner, what do 
you think of De Quincys humorous touches in this 
essay? O, dont look at the notes in the back of 
your book.
Miss BennerI was only looking to see if what 
you said was right!
The Cause of the Accident.
There was a young lady named Fitch,
Who heard a loud snoring, at which 
She took off her hat, and found that her rat 
Had fallen asleep at the switch.
Fashion.
One day the clothes-prop decided to go into so
ciety. First, she procured a massive wig, beauti
fully marcelled, with a huge Psyche knot projecting 
far out behind. Then she fastened under this a 
pretty false face highly tinted with carmine and 
with eyebrows skillfully penciled. Tearing down a 
lace curtain she fashioned it into a waist, having a 
very uncomfortable, stiffly boned collar and ex
tremely long, narrow sleeves with innumerable 
tucks. Colored shoes are all the rage, she said 
to herself and thereupon donned a gorgeous bed 
slipper. Grasping a portiere, she wound it closely 
but gracefully about her, leaving the corner drag a 
few feet behind for a train. Seeing a large lamp 
shade nearby she placed it upon her head and 
murmured, How fortunate! Tis the latest thing 
in hats. I think Ive reproduced that fashion re
markably.
E. C., 11.
Tit for Tat.
It was a wise Physician 
Said to a Dietician,
Your diet, my dear girl, is all wrong.
With the proper kind of food 
Youd be always understood 
And gaily would you sing your little song.
In reply, the Dietitian 
Said to the wise Physician,
You are very bold to tell me what to do.
I think youre very rude 
To criticise my food,
Which is not the reason why Im sometimes blue.
It strikes me that your Mission 
In life, as a Physician,
Is some suffring to alleviate each day.
If around youd take a look,
Youll see a little cook 
Who needs care and attention the worst way.
A Sign of Spring.
Its my turn first!
'Second!
Third!
Bob, you sit here on the pavement. Put your 
feet far apart. Thats right. Now watch. Ill put 
my man here and Glenn will roll for it. Are you 
on?
Yes, Im on, was the solemn reply.
Mrs. Rayman, hearing the voices, looked from 
the window. In the middle of the damp cold side
walk sat her young son, his chubby legs spread at 
the proper angle. In front of him on the walk was 
a large marble. A few feet away, stood her neigh
bors boy rolling commies in rapid succession. 
Finally, the large marble was hit and Fred put it 
triumphantly into his pocket. As Bob got up, one 
of his marbles rolled into the mud. He crawled 
after it, adding some of mother earth to his 
spring overcoat. Our stocking leg was coated. 
Mrs. Rayman sighed. Yes, I believe that spring has 
come, she said, turning from the window.
H. B., 11.
HIS CONFESSION.
Shes a dandy, winsome bit 
Of feminine humanity,
Entirely unaware of it,
And wholly free from vanity!
I lost my heart when first we met,
She was so sweet and squeezable
(I own I havent done it yet,
It never seemed quite feasible.)
But still she rules within my heart 
Andstrange peculiarity
'She binds me to her by an art 
Without familiarity.
I grow to love her more and more,
Though Im a husband dutiful,
And pray, why not? Shes only 4,
And doesnt know shes beautiful.

BASE BALL TRIP.
The team returned home Sunday from its eastern 
trip, with all the men in good condition with the ex
ception of Barclay and Reynolds. Barclay is sufforing from a twisted knee and Raynolds has a bad 
shoulder. It seems that the team had a sad break of 
luck in every game which they lost and especially in 
the State game. The game at Harrisburg was play
ed in mud and fielding by the out fielders was 
practically impossible. They sprung a big surprise 
on Albright by defeating them 4 to 0. Albright 
was just fresh from beating Carlisle and expected 
Tech to be easy picking. At Harrisburg the boys 
played a strong game but were beaten by the Tri-V 
state leaguers 9 to 1.

We have refrained from any remarks about onr 
various press agents, self appointed and otherwise 
on previous occassions, but we do think that last 
Sundays edition of one of Pittsburghs papers con
tained an article that has undoubtedly reached the 
limit.
We are all proud of our new field and the student 
enterprise, coupled with the unremunerated labor 
of some of the Faculty, that has made it possible, 
but we do not believe that it is necessary to multi
ply figures by seven or eight when speaking of its 
cost. No person at all interested will be able to 
deny that this school like all others in this district, 
needs all the legitimate advertising possible for our 
athletic events, for it is upon the patronage of the 
public that we depend. It may be that the public is 
so used to the three ringed colossal aggregation style 
of press agent dope that it refuses to notice any 
other, but we doubt it. While reading the article 
that has called forth this comment we were forced 
to look at the heading several times to make sure 
that we were not reading a description of Barney 
Drefuss field on Forbes street, and it would cause 
any one who takes these effusions seriously to be
lieve that we were erecting something to rival the 
notional league park.
As we said before we welcome legitimate adver
tising and are proud of our field, but we dont wish 
to make claims for which there is no ground, and we 
believe the interests of the schools are injured 
more by such articles than they would be by their 
absence.
All the students, whether day or night, know Mr. 
Leeds, and are grateful to him for his work as
treasurer of our Athletic Association, so it is with 
deep regret that we have to chronicle the death of 
his mother on last Saturday. Every one at the 
schools joins with The Tartan in extending to Mr. 
Leeds sincere sympathy in his berevement.
The account of the Oxford-Cambridge boat race 
was written by Mrs. John Dresser, nee Merriam, 
who was formerly an instructress in the Margaret 
Morrison school and \yho was an eye witness of the 
race.
MR. HEIN ROTHS LECTURES.
What promises to be one of the most interesting 
series of general lectures ever given here are those 
on Wednesday morning by Mr. Charles Heinroth. 
Following is an outline of the series:
Music, How It! Came to be What It Is.
1. Ancient and primitive Music. 2. Mediaeval Mu
sic (beginning of Christian Music, TroubadoursMinnesingers; Meistersingers. Folk Song. Netherland, the great music center). 3. Sixteenth Cen
tury (Polyphonic Music, Palestrina; di Lasso. The 
Madrigal Height of unaccompanied Church Music).

At the recent convocation, Mr. J. R. Newman, B. 
M., was chosen toastmaster to preside at the annual 
banquet. Considering Newmans pronounced ten
dency to be serious and his business career as a 
pants salesman, it is only likely that we shall hear a 
spirited defense of the instalment system from the 
dealers point of view. It is, therefore, only right 
and becoming that we accept his remarks in the 
serious spirit in which they emanate from his master
ful mind and allow ourselves to be daily chastened 
thereby.
We shall be de-lighted to hear another of Prof. 
Howers non-scholastic deliverances, and to watch 
Mr. Aude circle the square and equate the fourth

further elucidate the equation Two horses equal

PROGRESS IN TURKEY.
(A dispatch from Constantinople says foot-ball 
and automobiles are being taken up by the Turks.)
The Turkish senior blithely wrecks the Turkish 
juniors nose,
The Turkish sophomore goes down and bleeds some 
while he goes;
The Turkish foot-ball players writhe and jab and 
claw and tear 
And gouge out eyes and kick in teeth and do not 
seem to care.
But, lest the Turks who think that they are down 
to date forget,
We wish to say that Turkey has no high school 
frats as yet.
The motor cars -are smashing dogs hard by the 
Golden Horn;
In gay Stamboul the drivers laugh the old speed 
laws to scorn;
Constantinoples beggars .press themselves against 
the walls,
And here and there an ancient Turk who is not 
agile falls;
But landlords where the harems are and no man 
wears a hat
Have not as yet combined to bar the baby from the 
flat.
The Turks are getting on, they saytheyve rapidly 
progressed;
Theyve turned their backs against the East aud 
now are facing west;
Their statesmen fight in council halls, the wonu n 
lift their veils,
Turks even think sometimes and keep outside of 
Turkish jails.
But lest they put on airs and lest they in their pride 
forget,
We warn them that they have not learned to be 
strap-hangers yet.

THE PLEBE GAME.
While the varsity nine was being defeated by the 
State team last Saturday, the Ple'Pe team won their 
first victory, and in doing so they set a good example 
for the varsity to follow, for they defeated the Uni
versity of Pittsburg team. It was the Pitt fresh
men they played. Well, the way our team made 
that varsity pitcher Quailey look was something 
awful. He forced three runs by giving free pagses. 
What was more amusing however was the way that 
famous football hero Bunny Elliott struck out.
It was the Plebe teams first scheduled game, and 
they can be justly proud of the showing they made. 
Brown who pitched most of the game did very well 
and if he had had perfect support the Pitt score 
would have been much smaller. A peculiarity of 
the game was that none of the outfielders except 
Rex, who played center, had any put-out. Rex, how
ever, had six chances, every one of which was 
accepted without an error.

CRAFTSMENS CLUB DANCE.
If ever a club was organized to prosper and flour
ish, it must be conceded that it was the Craftsmens 
Club. Not contented with their all ready large list 
of accomplishments, they had to give the night 
graduating class of the Margaret Morrison School 
a dance, it was a dance long to be remembered in 
the annals of the club, not due to any brilliancy on 
the part of the boys, but the fine manner in which 
the girls rallied to our support.
Dean Connelly either developed a new trait or 
made good use of an old one, for he deliberately and 
without provocation marched up to one of the many 
prospective brides and took her from her future in
tended and waltzed off, whereupon the future groom 
repaired to the culinary department to quench his 
thirst for blood, on pink lemonade. Our friend Mr. 
Hass took advantage of the occasion to announce 
the coming wedding of our president, but was hap
pily surprised when the tables were turned and con
gratulations were in order for four instead of two.
Then there was some speculating about Mr. Zellman, but he successfuly eluded the question and 
we dont know much more now than we did then, 
but we all hope he will be warming his feet at his 
own fire side before long.

THE MAKING OF A TECHNICAL BOOK.
By Richard K. Meade.
Editor of The Chemical Engineer.
(Continued from last week.)
Most technical books are printed in 10 point type 
with an 8vo page. A page of such a book will have 
approximately 400 words. A 12mo book set in 10 
point type will have about 300 words. Small lGmo 
books are usually printed in 8 point type, some
times even smaller type is used for 16mo books.
A number of types of illustrations may be used to 
advantage. Half tones are made directly from pho
tographs or wash drawings. They form the most 
expensive class of illustrations and require good 
paper and first-class press-work to make them ap
pear weld. Unless photographs are washed or re
touched they do not always illustrate the points 
desired. For making half tones a sharp clear pho
tograph, such as a silver print with a slightly 
brownish tint, gives the best results. For illus
trating chemical glassware a photograph is nearly 
always a bad illustration and an outline drawing is 
to be preferred. These drawings should be made 
upon a bond or parchment paper or Bristol board. 
The paper is just as good and is much easier to 
draw upon. They should be made about twice the 
size of the finished illustration, that is, if an illus
tration 2 inches square is desired the drawing should 
be made 4 inches square. In most cases the author 
need not do more than furnish the publisher with 
rough sketches, blue prints, etc., of the illustrations 
he wishes to use, the publisher having the drawing 
done by some expert. It often happens that excel
lent illustrations for parts of machinery, apparatus, 
etc., may be obtained from manufacturers. There 
is no objection to the use of such illustrations in 
technical books. These cuts are usually made for 
the manufacturer at great expense afid represent the 
very best thing in the line of machinery illustra
tions. Occasionally exaggerated drawings are re
quired, that is, drawings all parts of which are not 
made in -proportion and in which certain parts 
(which it is desired to illustrate more minutely) are 
drawn to a larger scale than the rest of the illus5Ei^h5 rOiOT 6El

tration. Illustrations should not ,be placed upon 
the written or typewritten manuscript sheets, but 
should be placed upon separate sheets.
Where references are made to technical literature 
this can best be done by means of a footnote. These 
should usually be numbered if there are likely to be 
more than two or three to a page, rather than denoted 
by an asterisk or a dagger. In the manuscript, foot
notes are usually indicated by the following plan.2 In 
some works the references are explained at the end 
of the chapter, but the best plan is to have them at 
the foot of the page where they can be referred to 
promptly. At .the end of the chapter, however, it is 
usually good practice to give a brief descriptive 
bibliograph of the best books of reference 011 the 
subject treated in the chapter.
Every technical book should have a complete in
dex. This should be arranged alphabetically and 
should cover every point treated in the book. It 
should be so arranged as to facilitate reference. In 
making up the index, the simplest plan is to cut 
small strips of paper. The items and the page on 
which they are found are then jotted down on these, 
an item to a strip, after the author receives the 
final page proof of the book. These separate items 
can then be arranged alphabetically and the index 
made by copying them in the order of arrangement. 
Cross-references should be abundant. The surnames 
of authors and authorities cited in the text should 
appear in the index. Having completed the index, 
it should be compared, word for word, with the in
dexes of other books on the same subjects. In this 
manner, many omissions of subject heads for the 
index will be discovered.
Tables are usually placed at the end of a book if 
they are of a general nature, otherwise they are 
placed in the text. That is, in a work on analytical 
chemistry, the tables of specific gravities, factors, 
etc., should be placed at the end, while tables giving 
the results of analysis should be placed after the 
methods of analysis.
After the book has been accepted, the publisher 
or his assistant, will usually edit the copy very care
fully. It is.then sent to printer, who places it in 
type. This is now usually done by means of the 
linotype machine. This sets the type in the form of 
small slugs, each representing a line. These slugs 
are placed in order one after the other in a metal 
tray, known as a galley. What is technically 
galley proof is then sent the author. This conT

sists of strips of paper upon which the impression 
of the type in the galley has been taken by means 
of a roller. The strips have wide margins upon 
which corrections can be noted. This proof is read 
carefully and changes to be made are indicated on 
the margin. It is then sent back to the printer, who 
corrects the matter in type according to this proof 
and places the type in the form of pages. Proofs 
of these pages are then sent the author who makes 
a final revision and returns them. The book is then 
printed. Sixteen pages usually form a sheet. The 
sheets are then stitched together and the book 
bound. The printing of a technical book takes time 
and few books appear sooner than three or four 
months from the time the publisher receives the 
manuscript.
Where mathematical symbols are used, avoid 
Greek letters if possible, and reduce the number of 
unusual characters to a minimum, for typesetting 
on linotype machines is greatly facilitated when the 
number of characters is not large.
A good technical book represents much painstak
ing care on the part of the author both in the prep
aration of the manuscript and in the revision of 
the proof. Th best printing establishments make 
mistakes and the authors manuscript itself is sel
dom free from careless errors. The satisfaction of 
having made a noteworthy contribution to chemical 
literature, however, should pay the author for the 
time and trouble spent not only in assembling data 
and in presenting this, but also in the dull and tedi
ous work of revising manuscript and reading proof.
