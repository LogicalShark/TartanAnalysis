Tech Achieves a Great Victory
Carnegie Tech achieved one of the greatest vic
tories in the history of her football career by de
feating the strong Western Reserve University 
team of Cleveland on Saturday. Western Reserve 
won the State championship of Ohio last year, de
feating such teams as Case, Ohio State, and Ohio 
Ivjorthern. This fact makes Tech's victory all the 
more important. Western Reserve considered Tech 
as one of its easy games, and their defeat certainly 
brought gloom to their camp.
Morris kicked off to Reserves 20-yard line, 
where Tech recovered the ball on a fumble. 
Tech made first down on two line plays and 
then lost the ball on downs. Portman punted 
60 yards to Hittner, who returned 15 yards, 
Tech failed to make first down and Hittner punted 
to Reserves 20-yard line. Two attempts by Reserve 
failed and Portman punted 65 yards to Hittner, who, 
by a splendid exhibition of open field dodging and 
aided by timely interference, ran 80 yards through 
the whole Reserve team for a touchdown. He 
punted out to Mandeville and kicked a difficult goal 
against the wind. Shortly after this Flick got away 
for 25 yards, but Tech was forced to punt. Reserve 
started a steady progress toward Tech's goal by 
means of delayed passes and end runs. Corlette was 
pushed over the line for their touchdown. Wertz 
missed an easy goal and soon after the half ended.
Tech came back strong in the second half and 
more than held the Cleveland lads even. Only once
this half was Tech's goal threatened, and that was 
when Stewart, the right guard of Reserve, picked up 
a fumble back of Techs line and started toward the
goal line witha clear field.Dolin saved the day by
outrunning him and bringing him down with a
pretty diving tackle from behind. The game ended
with the ballin WesternReserves possession on
Teens 35-yard; line. Score

THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR 
BEGINNERS.
needed to keep the place, so that only the final result 
has to be read off the scale. As an example take
(Part 1 published in last weeks number contained 
a description of the Slide Rule, with exercises in 
reading the graduations and exercises in multiplica
tion.)
DIVISION.Can be done on the upper scales or on 
the lower, both with equal facility. The operation 
consists of subtracting the logarithm of the divisor 
from the logarithm of the dividend.
The subtraction is performed mechanically as 
shown in Fig. 7 so that the user does not think 
about the logarithms themselves. Two examples 
are shown in Fig. 7, first 1.65 divided by 1.31 giving a 
quotient 1.259, and second 66 divided by 74 giving a 
quotient .893. In either case there are three opera
tions. (a) Put runner at the dividend on the stock, 
(b) Move the slide until the divisor coincides with 
the runner, (c) Find the result under 1 of the slide 
(either end.) In the first example of Fig. 7
162
.00204
29 X 38 X 72
Using the A. B. scale the steps on the slide rule 
are: (1) Move the runner to 162 on A scale. (2) Set 
29 on B scale to the runner. (3) Move runner to 1 
on B. (4) Set 38 on B to the runner. (5) Move runner 
to 1 on B. (6) Set 72 on B to the runner. (7) Over
1 find 204, which is seen by inspection to be .00204, 
the result.
The same operations are compactly indicated in the 
following diagram.
(1) (3) (5) (7)
A R to 162 , Runner Runner j final result
BSet 29 J 1 | Set 38 | 1 | Set 72 | over 1

The numbers (1), (2), etc., on the diagram refer 
to the several steps described above.
Quotient t?S9 Dividend 16SDivisor^ 74-
Divisor 1.31Dividend 66Quotient .893
Fig! 7
the result is found under the left end of the slide, in 
the second example the result is found under the 
right end. In the second case the log. of the quotient 
is obtained by adding the arithmetic complement of 
the logarithm of the divisor to the logarithm of the 
dividend.

Notes on Exercise 5. (a) The number 8 occurs
twice cn scale A, and the divisor 2 occurs twice on 
scale B. It makes no difference which is taken, for 
the same result is obtained, (b) The decimal point is 
found by inspection, (c) The number n is given a 
special line on scale B. (d) The slide projects to the 
right, nearly out its groove. Using the A.B. scales 
this can be avoided, (e) The number n is not usually 
marked on the lower scales, so it must be read from 
its value 3:141. Time of working these examples by 
the slide rule is about 5 minutes.
SUCCESSIVE DIVISION.When one number is 
divided by a product of several factors the result is 
obtained by a series of divisions. The runner is

Notes on Exercise 6. (1) When the runner is
moved to 1 for the first time, the result is 647 divided 
by 2.3; when moved to 1 for the second time, the re
sult is 647 divided by (2.3 X 2.1): when moved'to 1 for 
the third time the final result 233 is read off. The 
decimal point is found by inspection.
(5) Place 785 on sl-ide at 1 on the stock: Take 
the mark 1 that is most convenient, either right or 
left.
This exercise can be worked on the slide rule in
5 minutes.
MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION.Are com
bined in making calculations like the following where 
the numerator and denominator both consist of sev
eral factors.
6.2 X 3.4 X 11.1
-----------------=3.25
2.7 X 7.61 X 3.5 
One way is to multiply the factors of numerator 
and denominator separately. A better way is to com
bine the multiplication and division as shown in the 
following diagram, using the A. B. scales.
(1) (3) (5)
A | R to 62 | Runner | Runner | result 325
B | Set 27 | 3.41 Set 761 |111| Set 35 i over 1
(2) (4) (6) (7)
This diagram is exactly like that already given
under successive division. The numbers (1), (2), (3), 
etc., indicate the order of the various steps.
The number of factors in numerator or denominator 
is not necessarily alike. For example,
8.7 X 231
-------------------------------= 16
1.41 X 2.73 X 4.95 X 6.6 
The diagram for working this problem is shown 
below.
Aj R to 87 | Runner | Runner | Runner | result 16
B; Set 141 12311 Set 273 | 1 | Set 495 | 1 | Set 66 | over 1 
The order of the various steps should be followed 
from what has preceded, without further explana
tion.
Exercise 7.
Perform these calculations on the A. B. scales.
7.7 X 240 9 X 3.62 X 5.21
(1) = 47.2 (4)-----------------------= 17.5
1.4 X 28.707 X 1.55 X 8i

21.2 X 3.14
22 X 8.7 X 8.7
= 1.60(3)----------------
1.02 X 4.44 X 9.18 
Notes on Exercise 7. (1) As a check repeat the 
operation with the factors in a different order, as 
240 divided by 28, then multiply by 7.7 and divide by
1.4. (2) The result in this case will fall above 5.2,
for this will be the last factor used. The time of 
working this exercise is 5 minutes.
A QUIET IDYLL.
In the evening, when the long shadows stretch 
themselves across the tall grasses and the birds 
whisper drowsily to each other from their downy 
nests, comes the quiet after thought of the busy, 
happy rush of daytime. It is then, as you may think, 
that each weary, way-worn soul gathers the peace 
of the twilight to his bosom, and, gathering also his 
fellow souls, finds some favorite retreat in which he 
may rest his aching body and refresh his famished 
mind.
In my travels, I have been wont to stop at twi
light in some quiet nook where I might think over 
the day and its diversified problems. At times, this 
nook is found in a meadow where a little stream sings 
sweetly, and a sheltering oak invites my companion
ship and promises pleasant tales from the soft 
rustling leaves. Here, a little breeze comes and fans 
my. brow with soft caress, and though I sometimes 
wish that it might tell me of the scenes oer which 
it has passed that day, still I am content to sit 
and dream, knowing that it must sometimes see 
sights that mortal eyes would shrink from in un
pleasant surprise.
One evening, as I sat meditating thus, a little maid 
approached me carrying a basket of ripe sun-warmed 
apples upon her head. She paused, looking at me 
out of her large startled brown eyes, hardly know
ing  whether to flee from me or to remain for a 
happy exchange of pleasantries. My smile seemed to 
reassure her, however, and she approached me slowly 
with unconscious grace of bearing and careless indif
ference to proprieties. After an exchange of smiles, 
words, and good will, she handed me some of the 
beautiful fruit, and turning from me, walked slowly 
away, only looking back to smile a farewell. And 
as I saw her go, and saw how the shapely head bore 
its burden, how the slender neck supported it all and 
how the well-rounded figure with its simple cotton 
clothes blended in with the scene of my evening 
reverie, a feeling of resentment came over me that 
all such sweet things must pass on and on, while I 
stayed behind it all and felt and longed and dreamed.
HELEN BAGLIN, 11.
The schools were visited last week by large num
bers of people attending the convention of the Chris
tian Church. They were all very much interested in 
the branches of study and the method of teaching 
them, in the Margaret Morrison school, and every one 
said that what we are accomplishing is wonderful.
We can hardly realize, yet, the full value of this 
beautiful school of ours, but some day we will be 
glad to say that we are one of its graduates. Its 
fame has gone all over the country, and people are

coming many miles to see what we are doing here. 
Letters come to Dean West from all parts of Canada 
and the United States asking for information, which, 
we may be sure, are readily answered.
One of our Plebes sent the clipping relating to the 
Margaret Morrison School (from the October issue 
of Good Housekeeping) to a Canadian gentleman 
greatly interested in the practical education of 
woman.
He said he could hardly believe that such a useful 
education existed in a city where the main idea 
seemed to be to make money and then lavishly dis
play it, and that his greatest wish is that Canada 
may some day have a school similar to that one of 
which we should be proud.
At the beginning of the school year, Dean West 
received a telegram from our former dean, Miss 
Smith (now Mrs. Hart), showing that she thought 
of us on opening day. The following is the tele
gram:
Big Timer, Mont., Sept. 26.
Miss Clara West,
Carnegie Technical School,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
May this year bring to you all every possible suc
cess and happiness.
ANNA B. HART.
There was a young man, a baseball fan,
In church fell asleep one day;
His dreams were of the baseball field 
Where his thoughts had gone astray.
The preachers theme was the life serene;
Inspired the words did roll;
How can we g.in blest Paradise?
Oh how can we reach that goal?
In ihe dreamed of game, for the home teams fame, 
The score was only fair.
To the preachers words came an answering shout, 
Slide or youll never get there!

After an absence of many moons the members of 
good old Nineteen Twelve have again assembled. 
The prediction of our prophet has, alas, not been 
fulfilled. There are some who, having assumed 
greater responsibilities, are not able to spend the 
pleasant evenings in the company of their fellows. 
There are others who, having been unable to fight > 
the wolf at the door, have betaken themselves to 
Gods country, the land of milk and honey, and 
such. There are still others, and our heart is moved 
with much compassion as we relate their discom
fiture, who have been caught in the net spread for 
those who study not.
But let us rejoice that we are yet so many and 
that, while, quantity has suffered, we still have the 
quality. Let us again burn the mid-night juice 
in quiet contemplation of the wonders of Science, 
as manifested in her text-books. Let us gather once 
again in the class room and lend a willing ear to 
the wisdom that is spoken by members of our 
faculty.
With these things in view it is the hope of your 
correspondent that you may enter upon a prosperous 
term and that your Hs may be many and your L's 
few.

It has been suggested that a new class office be 
created; namely, tnat of class censor, whoseduty

As the result of a rule adopted by the trustees of

FROM OUR EXCHANGES.
During the second, third and fourth years, especi
ally in the engineering courses, there is a great deal 
of trivial and tedious, yet very necessary computa
tion. The amount of time saved by the slide rule 
over the pencil and paper method is enormous, and 
it is the purpose of the course to make this slide 
rule computation really practicable for the student.

Engineers are born, not made, is the belief of W. 
J. Francis, of Montreal, who expressed his opinion 
in an address before the Enginering school of the 
University of Toronto. Mr. Francis further asserts 
that too little recognition is given to the three Rs

EDITORIAL
CHEERING AND JEERING.
The names sound much alike when pronounced, 
but the actual sounds themselves are as unlike as 
the spirits that prompt them. For three weeks we 
have refrained from making any comment of the 
fact that there have been things in connection with 
the behavior of the student body in the cheering 
section at football games that was not what it ought 
to be, for no other reason than it does not look very 
nice in print, and we hoped that it would be stopped 
without being advertised all over the United States. 
Our exchanges include most of the representative 
colleges, universities and technical schools in the 
East, and many in the South and West, so that what 
appears here is read by the editors and often ex
posed to the view of the student bodies of a half 
hundred places older than ourselves.
Last Saturdays victory over Western Reserve was 
a splendid triumph for Coach Snitjer and our team. 
It was clean work on both sides, and some of the 
most beautiful plays ever seen in a game with Tech 
were made by Western Reserve. There is no reason 
why the conduct in tne cheering section should be 
of another variety than that on the football field. 
When another college sends her football team here 
to play us on our home grounds, she has as much 
right to expect courteous treatment from the rooting 
section, as from the team. Western Reserve did not 
receive it. Jeering broke from a certain section of 
the stand when everything was not going our way;
offensive remarks were made by men in the rooting 
section, and cat-calls were heard on several occasions 
when Western Reserve was penalized. We are glad 
to say that the foregoing was confined to a very 
small section of the rooters stand, and was by no 
means general, but the fact remains that it took 
place. Before the game the editors made systematic 
preparations to spot any man or men in the Tech 
section guilty of any of the above named offenses, 
and they succeeded. If anything of the kind ever 
occurs again, the names of the guilty ones will be 
made public. The thing for Tech men to do is to cry 
down any attempt at jeering any official or player by 
any person, whether a Tech man or not.
MENTION THE TARTAN WHEN PATRONIZING 
ITS ADVERTIZERS.
A good many merchants are very skeptical in re
gard to the value of advertising in a school paper. 
The only way in whicn the merchant can know that 
he is getting returns on the money he is spending in 
advertising is to have his patrons tell him where 
they saw his advertisement. The Tartan, as is the 
case with every other newspaper, must depend 
largely upon its advertisements for its financial sup
port. Therefore, when you patronize a Tartan ad
vertiser, mention the Tartan to him.
NOTICE.
Tartan Cover Competition$10Reward$10.
Attention is called to the competition declared for 
a new cover for The Tartan. The time has been 
extended three weeks, making the drawings due on 
November 5th, at noon. All of the drawings sub
mitted must be made with Higgins or equally black 
ink on good paper, twice the size of the present 
cover (151/&"x2iy2"), as they will be reduced in the 
process of reproduction. The judgment will be made 
by a jury composed of members of the faculty of the 
School of Applied Design, acting with the editors 
of this paper. The prize offered is $10, $5 of which 
is donated by the Park Bank. No drawings requir
ing the half-tone process for reproduction will be 
considered; all must be in black and white. Addi
tional information will be furnished on request.
Since the first announcement of the competition 
for a design for the cover of the Tartan, much in
terest has been aroused. In order to give the Archi
tects, who are now working on a problem due Octo
ber 31st, a chance to go in the grand contest, the 
time for calling in the designs was extended, as the 
foregoing notices posted on the bulletin boards an
nounced. Any Tech student may enter. The de
signs will be judged according to their suitability 
of subject, and the degree of excellence of the ren
dering.

Mr. Carnegie attended some years ago one of

played ragged at times, but on the whole their game 
was good. Clements did some magnificent punting,

Higgins (section B in English): Debutante is

Prof. Schaeffer: If we boil water in a kettle, the

Why cant more Plebes stay to cheer their class

twenty-five stayed. We should have at least one hun

THE PITTSBURGH ORCHESTRA.
In its recent prospectus, the Pittsburgh Orchestra 
announces that it will give, during the coming sea
son, forty concerts, twenty afternoons and twenty 
evenings. The prices of the season tickets have 
been considerably reduced and special rates 
offered to teachers and students. This new rate is 
$5.00 for the season of twenty concerts. Secretary 
Field has arranged to get these tickets for all who 
desire them and, if enough will subscribe for them, 
he may be able to make a still better arrangement. 
All those desiring to hear these fine concerts at this 
exceptionally low price will please hand in their 
names to Mr. Field at once.
MEETING OF THE CLUB ROOM COMMITTEE.
Last Wednesday the Club Room Committee held 
its first session of the year, the meeting being held 
in the committee room in the Applied Science build
ing.
The Club Room Committee is composed of the fol
lowing five student members: C. H. Schultz and B. P. 
Poste, 1910; Witte, 1911; Schmucker, 1912, and Mc
Williams, Plebe.
No rules governing the use and disposition of 
the club room were discussed, the whole time being 
occupied in organizing. Schultz, 10, was chosen 
Chairman, and Schumucker Secretary and Treas
urer, eac-h to serve for the remainder of the year.
The committee will meet again next week; and in 
the meantime, any of the members will welcome 
any useful suggestions which may be offered by the 
students or members of the faculty.
A ROOM FOR THE SENIOR CLASS.
We believe a room should be set apart for the 
e'xclusive use of the Seniors, to which the members 
of the graduating class should have access at all 
times.
Such a room would always be available if the 
Director, the Dean, or any member of the faculty 
wished to address the class, or for a meeting with 
any one whose views and opinions the Director 
or the Dean might regard as beneficial to the class.
In addition, the room would be very desirable for 
social purposes, for class meetings, or for business 
transactions with anyone not connected with the 
schools.
This is a question which is of equal importance to 
all classes, and the idea should be given the sup
port oi every student.
Five fraternities at Brown University have agreed 
to postpone the season for rushing Freshmen until 
after the Christmas recess. The other fraternities 
are watching the experiment with much interest.

CEMENT SIDEWALKS.
Adopted January, 1909, by National Association of 
Cement Users.
Materials.
1. CementThe cement shall meet the require
ments of the specifications for Portland Cement of 
the American Society for Testing Materials, and 
adopted by this Association (Specification No. 1), 
January, 1906.
Aggregates.
2. Fine AggregatesFine Aggregate shall consist 
of sand, crushed stone or gravel screenings, graded 
from fine to coarse, passing when dry a screen hav
ing y^-in. diameter holes, shall be preferably of silicious materials, clean, coarse, free from vegetable

six per cent shall pass a sieve having 100 meshes 
per linear inch.
Mortars composed of one part Portland cement 
and three parts fine aggregate by weight when 
made into briquets shall show a tensile strength 
of at least 70 per cent of the strength of 1:3 mortar 
of the same consistency made with the same cement 
and standard Ottawa sand.
3. Coarse AggregatesCoarse Aggregate shall 
consist of inert material, graded in size, such as 
crushed stone or gravel, which is retained on a 
screen having ^-in. diameter holes, shall be clean, 
hard, durable and free from all deleterious ma
terials. Aggregates containing soft, flat or elongated 
particles shall be excluded.
The maximum size of the coarse aggregate shall 
be such that it will not separate from the mortar in 
laying and will not prevent the concrete fully filling 
all parts of the forms. The size of the coarse aggre
gate shall be such as io pass a 1%-in. ring.
4. WaterWater shall be clean, free from oil, 
acid, strong alkalies, or'vegetable matter.
Forms.
5. MaterialForms shall be free from warp, and 
of sufficient strength to resist springing out of shape. 
All mortar and dirt shall be removed from forms 
that have been previously used.
6. SettingThe forms shall be well staked to the 
established lines and grades, and their upper edges 
shall conform with finished grade of the walk, which 
shall have sufficient rise from the curb to provide 
proper drainage; but this rise shall not exceed threeeights (%) of an inch per foot, except where such 
rise shall parallel the length of the walk.
7. WettingAll forms shall be thoroughly wetted 
before any material is deposited against them.
Size and Thickness of Slabs.
8. SizeSlabs, without reinforcement, shall not 
contain more than 36 square feet, or have any di
mension greater than 6 feet. For greater area, slabs

rods, not more than nine (9) inches apart, or other 
reinforcement equally as strong.
9. ThicknessThe minimum thickness of the 
pavement shall not be less than four (4) inches.
Sub-Base.
10. Preparation  The sub-base shall be thor
oughly rammed, and all soft spots removed and re
placed by some suitable hard material.
11. FillsWhen a fill exceeding one foot in thick
ness is required, it shall be thoroughly compacted

six (6) inches in thickness, and shall have a slope 
of not less than one to one a half (1:1%).
The top of all fills shall extend at least 12 inphes 
beyond the sidewalk.
12. Wetting While compacting, the sub-base 
shall be thoroughly wetted and shall be maintained 
in that condition until the concrete is deposited.
13. ProportionsThe concrete for the base shall 
be so proportioned that the cement shall overfill the 
voids* in the fine aggregate by at least five (5) per 
cent, and the mortar shall overfill the voids in the 
course aggregate by at least ten (10) per cent. The 
proportions shall not exceed one (1) part of cement 
to eight (8) parts of the fine and coarse aggregates.
*To determine voids, fill a vessel with sand and 
let net weight of sand equal B. Fill same vessel 
with water and let net weight of water equal A.

14. VoidsWhen the voids are not determined, 
the concrete shall have the proportions of one (1) 
part cement, three (3) parts fine aggregates and five
(5) parts coarse aggregates. A sack of cement (94 
pounds) shall be considered to have a volume of one 
yl) cubic foot.
Mixing.
15. MixingThe ingredients of concrete shall be 
thoroughly mixed in the desired consistency, and 
the mixing shall continue until the cement is uni
formly distributed and the mass is uniform in color 
and homogeneous.
(a) Measuring ProportionsMethods of measure
ment of the proportions of the various ingredients, 
including the water, shall be used which will secure 
separate uniform measurements at all times.
(b) Machine MixingWhen the conditions will 
permit, a machine mixer of a type which insures the 
proper mixing of the materials throughout the mass 
shall be used.
(C) Hand MixingWhen it is necessary to mix 
by hand, the mixing shall be on a water tight plat
form and the materials shall be turned until they are 
homogeneous in appearance and color. i
(d) Consistency  The materials shall be mixed 
wet enough to, produce a concrete of such consist
ency as will flush readily under light tamping, and 
which, on the other hand, can be conveyed from the 
mixer to the forms without separation of the coarse 
aggregate from the mortar.
16. Retempering(e) Retempering  Retemper
ing mortar or concrete, i. e.,. remixing with water 
after it has partially set, shall not be permitted.
Placing of Ccncrete.
17. Placing(a) MethodsAfter the addition of 
water, the mix shall be handled rapidly to the place 
of final deposit, and under no circumstances shall 
concrete be used that has partially set.
(b) Freezing WeatherThe concrete shall not be 
mixed or deposited at a freezing temperature unless 
special precautions are taken to avoid the use of 
materials containing frost or covered with ice crys
tals, and in providing means to prevent the con
crete from freezing after being placed in position 
and until it has thoroughly hardened.
18. ProtectionSidewalks shall be laid in such a 
manner as .to insure the protection of the pavement 
from injury due to changes in foundations or from 
contraction and expansion.
Workmen shall not be permitted to walk on 
freshly laid concrete, and where sand or dust col
lects on the base it shall be carefully removed before 
the wearing surface is applied.
) 19. ThicknessThe wearing course shall have a 
thickness of at least one (1) inch.
20. MixingThe wearing surface shall be mixed 
in the same manner as the mortar for the base, but 
the proportion of one (1) cement to two (2) of fine 
aggregate, and it shall be of such consistency as

will not require tamping, but will be readily floated 
with a straight edge.
21. Depositing  The wearing surface shall be 
spread on the base immediately after mixing, and in 
no case shall more than fifty (50) minutes elapse 
between the time that the concrete for the base is 
mixed and the time that the wearing course is 
floated.
22. Marking After being worked to an approx
imately true surface, the slab markings shall be 
made directly over the joints in the. base with a tool 
which shall cut r'ear through to the base and com
pletely separatb the wearing courses of adjacent 
slabs.
23. EdgesThe slabs shall be rounded on all sur
face edges to a radius of not less than one-half (%) 
inch.
24. TrowelingWhen required, the surface shall 
be troweled smooth.
The application of neat cement to the surface in 
order to hasten the hardening is prohibited.
25. Roughening Wearing SurfaceOn grades ex
ceeding five (5) per cent, the surface shall be rough
ened. This may be done by the use of a grooving 
tool, toothed roller, brush, wooden float or other 
suitable tool; or by working coarse sand or screen
ings into the surface.
26. ColorWhere color is used it shall be incor
porated uniformly and the quantity and quality shall 
be such as to not impair the strength of the wearing 
surface.
Single Coat Work.
27. ProportionsSingle coat work shall be com
posed of one part of cement, two parts of fine aggre
gate and three parts of coarse aggregate, and the 
slabs separated as provided for in the specifications 
for two-coat work.
28. FinishingThe concrete shall be firmly com
pacted by tamping and evenly struck off and 
smoothed to the top of the form. Then, with a suit
able tool, the coarser particles of the concrete shall 
be tamped to a depth which will permit of finishing 
the walk as under Wearing Surface.
Protection and Grading.
29. ProtectionWhen completed, the walk shall 
be kept moist and protected from traffic and the ele
ments for at least three days.
30. GradingGrading after the walks are ready 
for use should be on the curb side of the sidewalk, 
one and one-half (1%) inches lower than the side
walk, and not less than one-quarter (Vi) inch to the 
foot fall towards the curb or gutter. On the prop
erty side of the walk the ground should be graded 
back at least two (2) feet and not lower than the 
walk; this will insure the frost throwing the walk 
alike on both sides.
Curbs.
31. TrenchThe trench shall be excavated to a 
depth not greater than the bottom of the curb and a 
width not greater than the thickness of the curb 
plus six (6) inches.

of the sidewalk and in no case more than six (6) 
feet apart.
35. FacesThe forms shall be removed as soon 
as practical and the faces finished at one operation 
floating down six (G) inches with a one to one mix
ture of cement and fine aggregate of sufficient thick
ness to produce a smooth surface.
36. GutterWhen a combination curb and gutter 
is required, they shall be cast at the same time and 
finished at one operation.The Industrial Magazine.
