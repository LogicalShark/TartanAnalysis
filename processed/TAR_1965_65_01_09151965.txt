by Sue Attinson
Morewood Grdens hs been filled beyond cpci^y ^his semes^er. The 
women's residence hll which normlly houses no more ^hn 657 is pre
sen^ly filled wi^h some 750 s^uden^s: pproxim^ely 280 freshmen, 440 
re^urnees, nd 25 ^rnsfers.
Becuse of ^he overflow of s^u

ordinrily used s doubles (B2, B5,

been conver^ed in^o ^riples mking 
39 ddi^ionl spces. Also, six s^u
den^s hve been housed ^empor
rily in 1A1 (previously ^he gues^ 
pr^men^) which hs no ^elephone 
hook-up, nd 29 o^hers hve been 
plced in A, D nd E Tower loun
ges. These s^uden^s were plced 
on ^he bsis of ^heir d^e of ppli
c^ion. S^uden^s who pplied erly 
received permnen^ qur^ers.
The old ^ower lounges, ech of 
which is loc^ed ^ ^he end of  
hll, hve no close^s bu^ hve been 
furnished wi^h beds, dressers nd 
desks. The new ^ower lounges, ech 
of which does hve  lrge wlk-in 
close^ (originlly design^ed s ^he 
luggge room), hve been furnished 
in  likewise mnner. None of ^he 
lounges hs  door bu^ ech hs 
been pr^i^ioned off wi^h  folding 
screen.
According ^o Virgini B. Milli
gn, den of women, ^he lounges 
pr^iculrly ^hose in A (^he honors 
^ower)will be emp^ied ou^ s soon 
s possible. The A Tower rooms 
will lso be clered of freshmen.

^o ^he housing problems ^emporry 
solu^ion, *We fel^ ^h^ if we hd s^

She credi^ed ^he problem i^self 
^o bo^h incresed enrollmen^ nd 
^he chnges in womens housing 
regul^ions. The cre^ion of n 
honors dormi^ory ^ook some of 
^he s^em off girls who hd wished 
originlly ^o move off cmpus.*
Thus, she feels, ^here were less 
openings ^hn expec^ed ^hroughou^ 
^he dorm.
She wen^ on ^o sy, however, 
^h^ Morewood Grdens hd been 
over-crowded in previous yers;
This is ^he wy we grow. When 
we did ^his before, i^ ws obvious 
^h^ we were going ^o need more

The Trip to Jackson
Michel Mlkoff, unior, IM, devo^ed his summer ^o engge in ^he 
Civil righ^s movemen^ in Mississippi, s  member of ^he Mississippi 
Freedom Democr^ic Pr^y (MFDP). His work ^here ws preceeded by 
^en dys of lobbying in Wshing^on, D.C. Wh^ will follow in ^his column, 
^ody, nd in ^he weeks ^o come, is his personl ccoun^, presen^ed in 
chronologicl order, of his experiences in nd feelings bou^ ^he civil 
righ^s movemen^.  ED.
The lobby hs ended for us. I^ is ^he beginning for o^hers. Equli^y 
for ll, le^ us be bro^hers, Wllce segreg^ion is bound ^o fll.* The 
people ou^side ^he bus re singing, we on ^he bus re solemn s ^he s^ff 
workers, our friends, who wish us goodby, good luck, nd God be wi^h 
you.* We wonder whe^her He will be. The us^ice of ^he sou^h or r^her 
^he inus^ice ^h^ will soon surround us, seems ^o hve lredy engulfed 
us. Life hs become  very, very serious ffir, ^he impc^ of which, for 
some of us, me included, hs never hi^ us before.
The bus hs now s^r^ed moving. The words Pece, Amen* drif^ 
^hrough ^he window. The word Shlom comes in^o my mind. The bus 
slowly leves ^he ci^y ^h^ hs been chrc^erized s  roule^^e wheel, 
wi^h ^he people ^he chips; Wshing^on, D.C. The odds in Wshing^on, in 
comprison wi^h Mississippi, our des^in^ion, were in our fvor, which 
we were ^o lern very shor^ly.
The fer builds up in me s ^he nigh^ goes on. Reding ^he pper, be^

hppen in my world of pushing  pencil for ^he ls^ four^een yers. Re

^he common occurrence of ^hem, lef^ me wi^h no^her impression. Their 
fces depic^ed ^he s^ory of ^he sou^h nd i^s vlidi^y which none could

Now I unders^nd even be^^er my own indequcy s I relize I hve

The Serch 
For Unders^nding
By James Panepinto
Universi^ys Purpose
During ^he ls^ cdemic yer, 
 number of significn^ s^eps were 
^ken, imed ^ chieving solu^ions 
^o problems exis^ing on ^he Cr
negie Tech cmpus. The dmin
is^r^ion, c^ing wi^h  more s^u
den^-orien^ed viewpoin^, now de
veloping under ^he ledership of 
Crnegie Techs new presiden^, 
Dr. H. Guyford S^ever, responded 
^o s^uden^ pe^i^ions wi^h surpris
ing rediness.
Severl of ^he new progrms 
which were ins^i^u^ed, nd some of 
revisions pplied ^o exis^ing pol
icies re pr^iculrly no^ewor^hy 
nd re, mos^ cer^inly deserving 
of commen^.
The hours of oper^ion for The 
Hun^ Librry were ex^ended, pro
viding s^uden^s wi^h fr gre^er 
oppor^uni^y ^o profi^bly employ 
i^s fcili^ies. Also, ^he s^uden^ 
governmen^ nd ^he dminis^r^ion 
under^ook ^o inves^ig^e ^he n^ure 
nd desirbili^y of Crnegie Tech's 
presen^ cdemic clendr.Com
prisons be^ween Crnegie Tech's 
clendr nd ^hose of o^her in
s^i^u^ions of higher lerning, no^
bly ^he Universi^y of Pennsylvni 
*B* clendr, were published. Fol
lowing ^hese comprisons, polls 
were conduc^ed ^o de^ermine s^u
den^ nd fcul^y opinions concern
ing ^he mos^ dvn^geous form 
which such  clendr should ^ke. 
Work on ^his m^^er is s^ill in 
progress.
Dr. S^ever recen^ly pproved 
^he es^blishmen^ of n experi
men^l honors ^ower in Morewood Grdens. The women who 
hve been chosen ^o reside ^here 
will be grn^ed unpreceden^ed 
freedom, nd will no^ be subec^ ^o 
^he imposi^ion of curfews. Finlly, 
concomi^n^ wi^h ^he honors ^ower 
progrm, sorori^y floors were es
^blished in Morewood,  s^ep de
signed ^o id ^hese orgniz^ions in 
chieving ^he uni^y nd cohesive
ness which ^hey hve previously 
no^ experienced.
Significn^ s ^hese chieve
men^s re, ^here s^ill remin, how
ever, mny pressing problems ^o
wrd ^he solu^ion of which ^he s^u
den^s, fcul^y, nd dminis^r^ic* 
mus^ direc^ ^heir energies. The 
chllenge which ^he Crnegie Tech 
cdemic communi^y mus^ fce is 
s^ill very rel.
The Tr^n, in ligh^ of ^his, does 
no^ offer, in perfunc^ory fshion, 
ny superficilly op^imis^ic view
poin^ concerning ^he degree of 
success which s^uden^s, fcul^y, 
nd dminis^r^ion migh^ chieve 
during ^his cdemic yer. The 
Tr^n, r^her, chooses ^o pre
sen^ ^his chllenge by ou^lining 
^he mor gols ^o be pursued, 
nd ^o urge ^he Crnegie com
muni^y ^o fce ^h^ chllenge wi^h 
en^husism nd vigor.
One mor difficul^y which hs 
mnifes^ed i^self qui^e clerly dur
ing ^he ps^ ^wo weeks is ^h^ 
oversubscrip^ion of dormi^ory 
spce hs resul^ed in severely 
crowded condi^ions  bo^h in ^he 
men's dormi^ory complex, nd
Morewood Grdens. Expnsion of 
^he dormi^ory fcili^ies is urgen^
ly needed. I^ is imper^ive, how
ever, ^h^ prior ^o ^he dop^ion 
of ny prospec^ive housing plns, 
comprehensive inves^ig^ions in
^o ^he n^ure of ^he educ^ion-living process ^ Crnegie Tech be 
conduc^ed ^o insure ^h^ new liv
ing fcili^ies will fulfill ^he needs 
of s^uden^s in ll ^he diverse c
demic progrms offered ^ Cr
negie Tech.
A somewh^ less pressing, bu^ 
none^heless eqully impor^n^ 
problem is ^he need for  s^uden^ 
union. Skibo serves only s n 
c^ivi^ies cen^er; i^ does no^ pro
vide s^isfc^ory recre^ion nd 
dining fcili^ies, nor does i^ pro
vide sui^ble s^uden^ g^hering 
plces. I^ is bsiclly  collec^ion 
of mee^ing rooms, which hs filed 
^o subs^i^u^e for  s^uden^ union.
Fur^hermore,  mu^ul misun
ders^nding exis^s be^ween ^he in
dependen^ men on ^he one hnd, 
nd ^he fr^erni^y men on ^he 
o^her. These ^wo groups, r^her 
^hn s^riving ^o min^in  hr
monious rel^ionship wi^h one n
o^her, hve es^blished rivlries, 
hve remined in ignornce of one 
no^her's ^^i^udes, vlues, nd 
gols, nd hve mde vir^ully 
no ^^emp^ ^o es^blish  spiri^ of 
cooper^ion. This in^olerble si^
u^ion hs served only ^o ^he 
de^rimen^ of ^he s^uden^ govern
men^, impiring i^s efficiency, nd 
hs seriously undermined en^hu
sism nd school spiri^, especilly 
mong ^he independen^s.
Finlly, ^he presen^ cons^i^u^ion 
of ^he s^uden^ governmen^ hs 
proved, in mny respec^s, very un
s^isfc^ory. The primry difficul
^y is ^h^ ^he deline^ion of ^he 
responsibili^ies, privileges, nd 
urisdic^ion of ^he vrious 
brnches of governmen^ is vgue, 
resul^ing in infringemen^s by some 
brnches on wh^ should be ^he 
responsibili^ies of o^hers, nd nul
lifying ^he effec^s of check-ndblnce sys^ems which re incor
por^ed wi^hin ^he frme of gov
ernmen^. The conflic^s which hve 
risen ou^ of ^hese deficiencies in 
^he cons^i^u^ion hve impired ^he 
| '|^i^y of ^he s^uden^ governmen^ ^o 
chieve i^s full po^en^il s  dy
nmic force on cmpus.
To solve ^hese problems, how
ever, i^ is necessry ^o rise ^he 
level nd increse ^he scope of 
communic^ions on cmpus. To 
chieve ^he gols ou^lined bove, 
^here mus^ be gre^er reciproci^y 
nd more comprehensive pro
grms llowing for ^he exchnge 
of ides be^ween fcul^y members 
of diverse professionl fields, be
^ween s^uden^s wi^h divergen^ c
demic in^eres^s, nd be^ween ^he 
s^uden^ body s  whole nd ^he 
dminis^r^ion.
The solu^ion ^o ^hese problems 
presen^s  serious chllenge. The 
Tr^n forsees  frui^ful yer for 
Crnegie Tech only if ^he cdemic 
communi^y s^rives ^o fce ^h^ 
chllenge wi^h resolu^e de^er
min^ion.
Af^er enoying ^he informli^ies

The Artist and His Studies
This is the first of a series of articles exploring the nature of 
our university: its philosophies of education, the sympathies of 
its students, and the relationship between its students and its 
faculty. Norman 0. Rice, author, is dean of the College of Fine 
Arts.
A Fine Ar^s s^uden^ is scrcely  ^ype ^h^ cn be pinned down by generli^ies. The r^s ^hemselves 
differ from ech o^her nd ^^rc^ differen^ kinds of people. In ^he end we hve in ^his College every^hing 
from prgm^is^s ^o poe^s, wi^h  rnge of chrc^eris^ics in be^ween ^h^ would s^onish mos^ people.
Some of ^he r^s require ^re
mendous physicl con^rol, o^hers 
do no^. Some^imes ^he con^rol is 
one of nrrow ^olernces, s in 
^he fingering of  violin or ^he de
line^ion of n exc^ shpe; some
^imes i^ is perhps no less pre
cise bu^ involves ^he whole body, 
s in ^umbling round ^he s^ge. 
The men^l con^rols hve ^o be 
^here, ^oo. These re buil^ up 
very sys^em^iclly in ll of ^he 
r^s, s^r^ing wi^h qui^e simple 
ides nd developing elbor^ion 
^o ^he poin^ ^ which rec^ion be
comes ins^inc^ive. If one hs ^o 
^hink bou^ ^he mechnics of drw
ing he does no^ drw, if one is 
preoccupied wi^h ^he ^echniques of 
c^ing he doesn'^ c^. S^uden^s re 
bound ^o hve deep concern for ^he 
crf^ ^hey re lerning, bu^ in my 
udgemen^ ^he crf^ is perhps ^he 
les^ pr^ of ^heir problem. Crf^
mus^ be ms^ered nd ccessible, 
bu^ ^he r^s begin by ssuming n 
dequ^e bse in crf^smnship, 
dequ^e, ^h^ is, for wh^ever ex
pression hs ^o be mde. If ^he 
expressive urge is ^here, ^he 
mens for ^urning i^ in^o r^ will 
generlly be found.
More Thn Crf^ Lerning 
The problem of ^he school ^hen 
is no^ ^o ber down on crf^ ^rin
ing exclusively for four college 
yers. The kind of digi^l dex^er
i^y ^h^ musicins nd drf^smen 
need goes on nd on nd mus^ be 
encourged nd prc^iced nd de
veloped ^o wh^ever s^reng^h ^he 
r^is^ needs. The sme cn be sid 
of voice con^rols s ^hey re prc
^iced by singers nd c^ors. The 
proec^ion of  ^one is impor^n^ 
us^ s ^he proec^ion of  word 
my be. If educ^ion in ^he r^s 
ended ^ ^eching ^hese ^hings, our 
^sk would be much less complex 
nd much duller. As i^ is, we be
gin in ech of our progrms wi^h 
^he business of ms^ering dequ^e 
^echniques. The depr^men^s p

Educ^ion in ^he Sciences 
The educ^ionl process in ^he

ul^ion, demons^r^ion, cri^icl evlu^ion nd ^hen usully recpu^ul^ion nd  new beginning. In my 
observ^ion, every^hing ^h^ n 
r^is^ knows he cn even^ully use. 
Bu^ lerning in ^he r^s is consi
derbly more ^hn ssembling 
fc^s. Of course r^is^s need ^o

Of course r^is^s need ^o know

Circumven^ing Obsolescence
There is no^hing mgicl bou^ 
four yers s n educ^ionl ^erm 
for nyone nd I suppose four 
yers is never enough ^ime ^o give 
n r^is^ ^o lern his ^rde. We

^h^ re found elsewhere, bu^ I 
^hink we cn sy ^h^ ^he College 
of Fine Ar^s ^ries ^o do precisely 
^his for ^he people i^ ^ouches. The 
obsolescence we fce, s I hve 
indic^ed, is of  differen^ kind. 
A good new ide in rchi^ec^ure 
does no^ mke obsole^e  good old 
ide. I^ is poin^less, however, ^o 
go on simply reproducing old ides 
or forms or encourging ^heir re
produc^ion in  school.

nd imgin^ive people, mus^ lern

Fine Ar^s Curriculum
Wi^h ll of ^he premble, wh^ 
cn I sy bou^ ^he curriculum in 
^he College? I cn describe i^ in 
firly succinc^ ^erms. Archi^ec^ure 
hs five yers nd ^he o^her depr^
men^s hve four yers; in^o ^hese 
^ime limi^s (which s I hve sug
ges^ed re purely rbi^rry nd 
which my no^ be ^ ll relis^ic 
for ^heir purpose) we hve de
veloped progrms which vry from 
depr^men^ ^o depr^men^ nd even 
be^ween op^ions in ^he sme de
pr^men^. Abou^ 25% of ^he ^o^l 
credi^ required in ^he College is in 
^he generl re of ^he humni^ies.
Some yers go ^he fcul^ies of 
^his college, working wi^h Humni
^ies nd Socil Sciences, developed 
^wo bsic courses. The firs^ yer 
we provide  combin^ion wri^ing 
nd reding course, which we cll 
Though^ nd Expression; in ^he 
second yer we require  survey 
of mn's cul^url his^ory (^h^ is 
^o sy his^ory wi^h emphsis on 
mns cul^url chievemen^ r^her 
^hn on his mili^ry, poli^icl or 
economic mu^^ions). This course 
is clled His^ory of Ar^s nd Civil
iz^ion. I^ is possible for scholrs 
^o be scornful of bo^h of ^hese 
courses becuse ^hey ^^emp^ fr 
^oo much in ^he ^ime we give ^hem. 
They re in^ensive, ^hey require  
gre^ del of reding nd wri^ing 
nd ^hey re ^ugh^ wi^h vrying 
levels of success by vrious mem
bers of ^he fcul^y who hve ^
^emp^ed ^hem over ^he yers. In

provide  bse for in^elligen^ red

^he cmpus ^here hve been mny 
chnges in bo^h of ^hese courses. 
The English nd His^ory depr^
men^s hve worked hrd nd help
fully wi^h our own fcul^ies in ^he 
hope of mximizing ^heir in^eres^ 
nd effec^iveness. Al^hough ^hese

resons i^ is simpler ^o mnd^e 
^hese ^wo courses ^hn ^o give be

mny more complex nd diversi

courses for our people; if I did 
no^ ^hink ^hey were good college 
level courses for nyone, I would 
no^ udge ^hem ^o be good enough 
for ^he College of Fine Ar^s. I^
