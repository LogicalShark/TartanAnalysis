Students speak out in smoking ban survey
by Sabrina Porter
Staffwriter
Thirty-eight percent of' stu
dents voted in favor of the 
universitys proposed smoking 
ban, while 52 percent voted 
against it, according to survey 
results released Tuesday night.
The survey, administered by 
Student Senate, solicited stu
dents views on a September 
2006 proposal to ban smoking 
everywhere on campus by 2010.
The quantitative response 
we received through the poll is 
greater than the typical level
of response by CMU students, 
which we are pleased with, said 
Megan Larcom, chair of Campus 
Life on Student Senate and firstyear business major.
The original proposal was pre
sented to Student Senate two 
weeks ago by the Healthy Cam
pus 2010 Task Force, made up 
of undergraduates, graduates, 
faculty, and staff from different 
departments. The groups re
port, Tobacco Use on Campus: 
Progress Toward a Smoke Free 
Community in 2010, highlighted 
its three main goals in achieving 
a campus-wide smoking ban.
The Task Forces first goal is
to prohibit smoking in all university-owned buildings, from 
fraternities and sororities to resi
dence halls and classrooms.
University policy currently 
allows smoking within 20 feet 
of the entrance to any campus 
building.
The report recommends insti
tuting a preliminary policy that 
would prohibitsmoking in all in
door facilities and allow it only in 
designated outdoor areas of cam
pus. By January 1,2010, smoking 
would be banned completely on 
all areas of campus.
Research tells us that a large 
number of college students start
smoking when they come to 
college, said Anita Barkin, di
rector of Student Health Services 
and chair of the Task Force. By 
having a smoke-free community, 
you decrease the chance that a 
student will initiate the habit 
because the community norm is 
non-smoking. '
The proposals second goal 
is to promote the community 
norm by eliminating all tobacco 
marketing and sales on campus.
The task force recommends 
ceasing tobacco sales at Entropy, 
ending tobacco advertisements 
in publications, and continuing 
current smoking treatment proJustin Brown/Photo Editor
grams, such as those run by Stu
dent Health Services.
Research also tells us that 
a majority of smoking students 
want and try to quit, Barkin 
said. A smoke-free community 
provides a more supportive en
vironment for the person trying 
to quit.
Thirdly, the Task Force hopes 
to prevent tobacco use in the 
young adult population through 
a campus-wide effort, led by 
Barkin, to extend education out
reach initiatives to both Carnegie 
Mellon students and Pittsburgh

By the time he reached high 
school, Kiley Williams was famil
iar with business. He had started 
creating his own programs at age 
9 and had already been tapped 
by technology companies with 
job offers. He often held down 
two at a time.
Last summer, the junior in 
information systems started 
FrontListings.com as an alterna
tive to the popular MiscMarket, 
an online bulletin board where 
users post buy and for sale 
listings. Williams thought Misc
Market was useful but difficult 
for users to manage, so he created 
a program that would instantly 
take information sent over Misc
Market and format it in a more 
readable way. When friends Nick 
Bannister, a senior electrical and
computer engineering major, 
and Uday Singh, a junior infor
mation systems major, looked at 
it, they encouraged Williams to 
turn it into a service others could 
use. The trio is working on their 
first round of marketing.
FrontListings isnt Williams 
first taste of success. He was also 
the creator of CMU Connector, a 
network which allowed users on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus to 
chat in real-time and share files. 
The site was dismantled in Janu
ary, ending its 18-month run.
Williams created the program 
to honor his best friend, a stu
dent at the Rochester Institute 
of Technology, who had been 
sued by the RIAA for illegal 
file-sharing. When he was un
able to pay the $5000 tab,, RIT 
took away his scholarship, which 
forced him to transfer to a com
munity college.
Connector attracted attention
again last month, when com
puter science professor Richard 
Pattis posted an e-mail he re
ceived to his class discussion 
board. The e-mail decried the il
legal distribution of copyrighted 
materials and reported that a 
complete answer key to a cal
culus textbook was available on 
the network.
In a separate instance, 
Williams was summoned to the 
assistant deans office, not to 
shut down the network but to 
discuss whether the program 
had any potential large-scale 
uses that were legal. Williams 
decided that it had none, and 
rather than risk a run-in with the 
RIAA, made the decision to end 
the service.
Williams unhooking of 
Connector was a blow to the 
programs 2800 users, who

Grab a 
bike, get 
to class
Senate approves 
campus bike 
proposal
by Brian Burdulia
Junior Staffwriter
Next month, students may 
never have an excuse for being 
late to class again.
Under student governments 
Public Rec Program Pilot Study,' 
the university will distribute 
a fleet of 40 to 45 one-speed 
1950s-style cruiser bikes around 
campus to be shared by the cam
pus community. The study will 
also place 10 heavy plastic out
door containers around campus 
filled with an assortment of out
door recreational equipment.
Neither the equipment con
tainers nor the bicycles will be 
locked at any time.
The program is the brain
child of Student Body President 
Karl Sjogren, a senior social and 
decision sciences major, and 
Student Body Vice President 
Andrea Hamilton, a senior art 
and ethics, history, and public 
policy major.
The initiative was passed by 
Student Senate at its February 
15 meeting.
The pilot study is designed to 
allow students and staff to use 
the equipment at their leisure. 
Rather than having to take 
time signing out a bike and 
locking it up, anyone on cam
pus can grab a bike in order to 
ride across campus to make a 
class, go grocery shopping, or 
relax and take a ride through 
Schenley Park. Once a person is 
finished with the bike, he or she 
can leave it at any rack on cam
pus for someone else to borrow.
The plan is a way to promote 
a stronger sense of campus 
community and increase per
sonal mobility, Sjogren sard. 
The bikes are meant to make 
surrounding areas-like Shadyside and East Liberty seem open 
and accessible to students who

Writer addresses Middle East issues
by Mark Rudnick
Junior Staffwriter
Last Wednesday, students, faculty, and mem
bers of the local Pittsburgh media gathered in the 
Adamson Wing of Baker Hall to hear Khaled Abu 
Toameh give his unique perspective on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict.
Toameh, a writer and editor for the Israeli Je
rusalem Post, is a renowned journalist who covers 
the. crisis in the Middle East for the Post as well as 
numerous international news organizations, in
cluding the Palestinian Liberation Organization 
(PLO).
Toameh described himself as an Israeli-Palestinian-Muslim-Arab with an identity crisis.
In his lecture, Toameh spoke about his life as a 
journalist working for news organizations under 
both the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli gov
ernment. As a writer for the PLO, Toameh faced 
extreme restrictions on what he and his fellow 
journalists could report; they were essentially con
fined to writing articles praising Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestinian president at the time. After five years, 
Toameh made the decision to try his luck in the in
ternational media circuit because writing for the 
PLO, in his words, just wasnt journalism. He has 
found his experience working in the Israeli and 
international press to be much more pleasant and 
satisfying.
Despite the continued poor levels of transparency 
and objectivity in the Palestinian media, Toameh 
did point out a few things to be hopeful about.
He explained that rising competition among Arab 
news stations like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya have 
been banned from many Middle Eastern countries 
(with the exception of Israel), which has begun to 
stir a debate in the Arab world about the need for 
reform in government control of the media.
The only country in the Middle East that Al 
Jazeera is free to act in is Israel, Toameh said. I

Pittsburgh takes in 
displaced novelist
WRITER, from A1
culture and political atmo
sphere, according to a February 
11 article in the Pittsburgh PostGazette.
While I never received what 
you might call official threats, 
I knew that with the way things 
are in'my country, [the threats] 
were very real, Moya told the 
Post-Gazette. And, I knew 
no one would ever be held 
responsible.
The writer is the second per
secuted artist to relocate to the 
Pittsburgh chapter of Cities of 
Asylum. Huang Xiang, an im
portant post-cultural revolution 
poet from China, came to the 
city in November 2004. Both 
artists have already formed ties 
with the English department 
at the University of Pittsburgh. 
Moya will teach a course titled 
Post Magical Realism in Latin 
American Literature next fall, 
which will be cross-listed for 
both undergraduate and gradu
ate students.
I was invited by Chuck 
Kinder [the director of the Writ
ing Program in the English 
department], to think about the 
possibility of giving a course 
in the Creative Writing [pro
gram], Moya said.
Last spring term, COAs first 
writer-in-residence, Huang 
Xiang, taught a seminar on Chi
nese poetry for us, Kinder said. 
The University of Pittsburgh 
also helped to sponsor Wole 
Soyinka, the Nigerian Nobel 
Laureate in Literature, when he 
visited Pittsburgh last Septem
ber to dedicate the second COA 
residence.
John Frechione, associate di
rector for research and devel
opment of the Center for Latin 
American Studies at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, agreed.
In general, we have offered 
to assist [Moya] in any way we 
can, Frechione said.
That includes appointing him 
as a center associate of the Cen
ter for Latin American Studies
and allowing the writer access 
to the University Library System 
and the Eduardo Lozano Latin 
American Library Collection.
These resources will help 
Moya begin work on his next 
creative fiction piece, or rather, 
pieces  Moyas next work will 
be a trilogy about the political 
atmosphere in El Salvador fol
lowing World War II.
In addition to the appoint
ment, Frechione said, the 
English department has also 
placed Moya on mailing lists to 
receive information about Latin 
American-related events at the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
throughout the local region.
Moya has been impressed with 
the small but active Latin Ameri
can community of Pittsburgh.
Im just starting to move 
around. There are a lot of activi
ties, Moya said.
NANCA, the North American 
Network of Cities of Asylum, 
looks for busy communities like 
Pittsburgh as possible locations 
in which to start new chapters 
of the organization.
In each North American Asy
lum city, a grassroots effort is 
essential to ensure the longevity 
of the program. We will do our 
utmost to match a persecuted 
writer with a city willing to host 
and support that writer, the 
organizations executive board 
stated on the groups website.
In addition to his academic 
exploration with the University 
of Pittsburgh, Moya has also 
explored the city itself, includ
ing the Mexican War Streets 
neighborhood in the north side, 
according to the Post-Gazette.
Is collaboration with Carn
egie Mellon next?
Im open to regard any invi
tation, the writer stated.
Moya said that he wasnt 
sure how living and working in 
Pittsburgh, as opposed to Latin 
America, will affect the charac
ter of his upcoming trilogy.
Who knows? Moya said. 
The process of writing is al
ways mysterious.
Seventh annual Mosaic gender issues conference tackles social norms
Deren Guler/Assistant Photo Editor
Acting professor Matt Gray pres
ents a session on gender behavior.
by Maria Zayas
Junior Staffwriter
The seventh annual Mosaic 
conference was held yesterday in 
the University Center from 10:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mosaic brings 
to campus an array of discussion 
and dialogue on issues related to 
gender and its social construc
tion. This years theme, Lenses: 
Gender in Focus, aimed to cri
tique the ways in which people 
view and accept socially con
structed gender norms.
WNBA All-Star and 3-time 
Olympic Gold Medalist Sheryl 
Swoopes delivered the keynote 
address. Following Swoopes pre* 
sentation, participants had four 
sessions during which they could 
attend workshops on a variety of 
subjects, including international 
conceptions of gender, fashion, 
violence in relationships, and
GLBT adoption experiences.
Swoopes spoke about coming 
out as a homosexual female ath
lete and the ways in which her 
sexual orientation has affected 
her life and career. She described 
having to live for years hiding 
her sexual identity and learning 
how to bounce back from chal
lenges. Swoopes described the 
turning point in her life, when 
she realized she was fed up with 
pleasing society and putting oth
ers happiness before hers, and 
decided to consider her own feel
ings first.
Swoopes explained how she 
saw her life reflected in the theme 
of Carnegie Mellons public art 
piece, Walking to the Sky.
I wondered about the two 
guys at the bottom... [they were] 
waiting to see if the others were 
going to fail, which reminds me 
of my life. We all live under a 
microscope. [Because of that],
making the announcement to 
come out and all the negative 
things people had to say, made 
[coming out] the hardest thing 
I had ever done in my life, she 
said.
Swoopes believes that, female 
or male, its difficult to be gay in a 
professional athletes world.
The world is not ready for a 
gay male athlete, she said. We 
put these men on a pedestal, and 
people are not ready for such a 
change.
The reason homosexual males 
refrain from coming out dur
ing their careers, Swoopes said, 
is because [they] probably 
wouldnt be alive right now if 
[they] had.
Swoopes did share one recent 
career highlight that she was par
ticularly proud of  along with 
five other women, she will be a 
playable character in the Xbox 
game NBA STREET: Homecourt.
It will be the first time WNBA 
stars will be included in a video 
game along with NBA stars.
The lack of women in the 
video game world was the topic 
of discussion in the session titled 
Game Over: Video Games & the 
Gender Divide, led by senior 
computer science major Chris 
DeLeon.
In his presentation, DeLeon 
reported that women are out
numbered 9:1 in the industry. 
The lack of female designers, 
he said, accounts for the lack 
of available titles that interest 
women.
More boys than girls tend to 
play video games because the 
industry is targeted at the male 
demographic. However, girls 
are missing out on gaining valu
able skills. Children develop new 
abilities from playing games,

might otherwise be confined to campus.
The athletic equipment in the outdoor 
containers is meant to facilitate general 
camaraderie and activity around campus, 
Sjogren said. When weather improves in 
the spring, students will be more inclined to 
relax, read a book, or do homework on the 
cut. He hopes providing the communal ath
letic equipment will bring activities to places 
where students already congregate.
The pilot study will begin the last week of 
March or the first week of April. The kick-off 
ceremony will also include a contest in which 
groups or individuals can enter to paint one 
of the bikes.
The bikes and the equipment will all be 
painted red with yellow, blue, and green 
stripes to resemble Tartan plaid.
The highly recognizable motif is one mea
sure being taken to prevent theft, one of the 
major concerns of some members of Student 
Senate. While Senate passed the initiative 
with a vote of 19:3:2, according to the min
utes for the February 15 meeting, members 
questioned how the program was going to be 
run from a logistical standpoint.
Since Carnegie Mellon is considered an ur
ban campus, members argued, the initiative 
may lure people from outside the school to 
campus to steal bikes or equipment.
Sean Weinstock, a junior business major 
and member of Student Senate, felt that there 
were better ways to run this program. For 
example, he suggested having the info desk
facilitate the borrowing of bikes and equip
ment. This way, the university would not 
have to hire and pay new personnel, and all 
items could be accounted for.
Anyone can come on campus and take this 
equipment, Weinstock said of the current 
plan.
However, Weinstock agreed with Sjogrens 
objective, which is to foster a stronger sense 
of campus identity. If run properly, Weinstock 
said, this initiative will achieve that goal.
The total cost of the pilot will be upwards 
of $13,000, Sjogren said. Senate has allotted 
$2000 for the project; other donations will 
come from various university and private 
sources, including Carnegie Mellon Athletics, 
Student Affairs Council Chairman Mike Mur
phy, President Cohon, Student Development, 
Student Activities, and Student Dormitory 
Council.
The university will purchase the cruisers 
from Iron City Bikes, who will also be coming 
to campus to perform light maintenance and 
oil changes on the bikes throughout the year.
While some members of the university 
regard the project as fiscally irresponsible, 
Sjogren reiterated that the funding will only 
cover the one-year pilot study. Throughout 
that time, student government and univer
sity personnel will gather data to determine 
whether sustaining the project is worth the 
full cost.
He defended the practice of non-regulation 
by stating that the cost of setting up a network 
of card readers at each bike rack and equip
ment container would end up being more
expensive than just having to replace lost or 
stolen equipment.
Preliminary numbers show that it will be 
cheaper to have $1500 stolen than to institute 
security or card readers.
We know people are going to steal, Sjo
gren said.
If the study shows that the rate of theft 
compared to the price of replacing equipment 
is low enough, he explained, the program can 
continue, even though it will never have the 
ability to generate revenue.
If the project continues past the trial period, 
the Public Rec Program plans to increase the 
fleet by six to 10 bikes per year.
Carnegie Mellon is not the first college or 
university to institute such a project.
A similar program at the College of Wil
liam and Mary was instituted in 2004. The 
project has been successful, but it is run by 
the administration and the college locks up 
the bikes at night.
In contrast, Sjogren spoke positively of the 
fact that neither the bikes nor the equipment 
boxes under Carnegie Mellons plan will be 
locked.
[This way] enforcement does not belong 
to one person, he said.
Rather, he explained, the program is con
tingent upon students policing themselves 
and their peers in using the equipment.
The Rec Plan is based on the mutual trust 
of the student body as a whole, Sjogren said. 
The success of such a plan does not just re
ward the individual, he added, but is a vote of 
confidence for the entire campus community.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 26, 2007
Majority against 
ban, survey says
Should Carnegie Mellon Ban Smoking by 2010?
On February 12-13,1837 students participated in Student 
Senates smoking ban survey. Heres how they voted:
DONT CARE 
a
participation was voluntary.Source: Student Senate
SMOKING, from A1
youth.
Students responses to these 
initiatives has been mixed.
The survey results represent 
the views of 1837 Carnegie 
Mellon students, whose par
ticipation was voluntary. The 
students were asked a series 
of seven questions which dealt 
with different areas of the ban: 
whether smoking should be al
lowed in fraternities, if students 
should be fined for smoking on 
campus property, if cigarettes 
should continue to be sold at En
tropy, whether there should still 
be tobacco product giveaways on 
campus, if there should be more 
anti-smoking publicity on cam
pus, whether Student Health 
Services should create more pro
grams to help students quit, and 
whether or not the university 
should impose a total smoking 
ban. Students stated whether 
they were for, against, neutral, 
or didnt care about each issue. 
They were also given the op
portunity to comment on each 
aspect of the proposed ban.
With about 30 percent of the 
undergraduate student body 
participating in the referendum,
I think we got a fairly balanced 
view of how the campus feels 
about the ban, said Lauren Hudock, communciations chair on 
Student Senate and junior pub
lic policy and management and 
philosophy major.
Thirty-six percent of students 
voted against banning smoking 
in fraternities, while 38 percent 
were in favor of continuing the 
current policy.
I think a frat house is a com
pletely different environment 
and deserves some special atten
tion.... Im not personally part of 
a frat... but when I think of frats I 
think of things like hookahs and 
so on, one student wrote on the 
survey.
Sixty-two percent of students 
surveyed agreed that students 
who violate the smoking policy 
should be fined by campus po
lice, while 28 percent argued 
against the fines.
Students were more divided 
when asked if cigarettes should 
continue to be sold at Entropy
 35 percent were in favor of 
continuing the current policy 
while 45 percent voted to elimi
nate the sale of cigarettes and 
tobacco on campus.
However, many students were 
confused by the question about 
giveaways on campus because 
few had ever seen cigarettes 
given out on campus.
This basically refers only to 
one day a year when Sigma Nu 
holds a smoke-a-thon on Na
tional Quit Smoking Day where 
anyone who walks by can smoke 
a cigarette, cigar, or hookah for 
free, said Gerrit Betz, a seniorethics, history, and public pol
icy major and chair of Student 
Senates Internal Development 
Committee. Otherwise, ciga
rettes arent really free on this 
campus unless youre borrowing 
one from a friend.
Sixty-three percent of students 
were against giving out tobacco 
for free, while 22 percent were 
in favor of free smokes.
Students strongly indicated 
that they wanted their fel
low classmates who smoke to 
get help quitting. Forty-seven 
percent of students surveyed 
supported increasing the level 
of smoking education on cam
pus through advertisements and 
propaganda, and 79 percent of 
students supported creating bet
ter programs to help students 
quit smoking more effectively.
There is general public rec
ognition of the negative health
Ha Jin Choi/Art Staff
effects resulting from smoking, 
Barkin saicl. More and more 
Americans are quitting.
Barkin also reminded students 
that smoking is the leading pre
ventable disease in this country, 
according to the surgeon gener
als report.
However, there are still stu
dents who believe that the 
decision to ban smoking here at 
Carnegie Mellon would have a 
negative impact on the universi
tys image.
I can see this restriction 
having more significance than 
reducing the amount of smoke, 
Huddock said. It will change 
the mentality of the people on 
campus and the activity that you 
see on campus.
While a decision to ban smok
ing could show the universitys 
commitment to the health of its 
students, it also may appear to 
question students freedom and 
portray the university as unwel
coming to students who smoke.
Students should be treated 
like adults and trusted to make 
their own lifestyle decisions, 
wrote one student surveyed. 
Given all of the information 
already out there, I do not be
lieve more funding needs to be 
dropped into this.
University data approximates 
that between 10 and 15 per
cent of the campus community 
smokes.
When Barkin asked students 
if a smoking ban would have 
changed their decision to come 
to Carnegie Mellon, most stu
dents said no.
In addition to Student Senate, 
the Healthy Campus proposal 
has been presented to the Grad
uate Student Assembly, the 
Student Dormitory Council, and 
the Interfraternity Council.
Although the survey results 
have proven be helpful to admin
istrators, they have not reached 
a final consensus.
This [proposal] is only a 
list of recommendations at this 
point, said Barkin. The Task 
Force will evaluate all of the 
feedback we have received and 
send a policy recommendation 
to the Presidents Council. It is 
then likely that we will have to 
go back to Faculty Senate, Stu
dent Senate and Staff Council 
for a vote before it goes back to 
the Presidents Council for a vote 
for adoption. Only then would 
the announcement be made.
If the ban were to be enacted, 
Carnegie Mellon would be one of 
the first universities with such a 
policy in effect.
The University of Pittsburgh, 
Duquesne University, Carlow 
University, and Point Park Uni
versity have all enacted partial 
smoke-free policies.
However, only a very small 
percentage of schools nationwide 
have chosen total prohibition 
policies.
We have done some bench
marking to find out what peer 
schools are doing and we have 
shared the list of smoke-free 
campuses with everyone, Barkin 
said. Most of the schools on the 
list are not peer institutions. 
Many of the schools listed 
were local and community col
leges, where such policies can 
be enforced more easily because 
the student population is smaller 
and most students commute.
The decision to ban smoking 
has also made it into local poli
tics.
Last year, the Allegheny 
County Council proposed a bill 
that would prohibit smoking in 
restaurants and bars, a law that 
has already been enacted in cit
ies like New York and Chicago.
County representatives will 
vote on the bill in June.
Student entrepreneurs debut web companies
BUSINESS, from A1
traded rumors of the reasons 
behind the downfall in the fol
lowing weeks. A few weeks 
later, Williams submitted a post 
on MiscMarket which promised 
users a full explanation of the 
downfall of CMU Connector on 
his new site, FrontListings.com. 
It was a move credited by junior 
information systems major. Paul 
OShannessy as a slick way to 
launch.
Another group of friends has 
been working since last fall on 
a project that they believe will 
change the way people buy and 
offer services. The founders of 
mymave.com, who met as mem
bers of the track team, are now 
members of a company, which
they operate from the basement 
of the Track House on South 
Neville Street and incorporated 
last month.
Mave was envisioned by junior 
business major Mark Tressler, 
who last July composed a 30- 
page plan for the project in one 
night and sent it on to his friend. 
Tresslers concept was to create 
a service that would allow every 
person to operate as his or her 
own business  users would list 
their abilities and allow others 
to bid on their services. Tressler 
even planned out how the site 
would be an equal opportunity 
enterprise by allowing users to 
only see first initials of names and 
preclude personal information.
The project has grown to four 
students who operate the system
in every free moment, Tressler 
said.
Sophomore computer science 
major Breck Fresen has opted 
for a minimal courseload to con
centrate on the project, while 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major Geoff Misek 
balances his Mave work with a 
full courseload and a girlfriend, 
who is very supportive, he 
quickly added.
The company owes its mar
keting prowess to Misek, who 
dressed up like a Sherpa on the 
coldest night of the year to chalk 
sidewalks and post fliers at Carn
egie Mellon and the University 
of Pittsburgh promoting the ser
vice.
Tressler came up with the com
panys Facebook is fun slogan,
and junior economics major Will 
Lutz, the groups fourth member, 
explained that its a jab that while 
Facebook may be fun, it doesnt 
have much functionality.
But Mave does. The site has 
over 1100 registered users with 
485 businesses promoting their 
services.
Tressler believes that everyone 
has the ability to market him or 
herself.
Really think about what 
youre good at doing, Tressler 
suggested. If you write in a 
journal, sign up to be a creative 
writer.
Tresslers Mave profile, for 
example, boasts that he can cut 
hair or give you tours of local col
leges, services not yet offered by 
other high-tech executives.
Journalist discusses Middle East issues
LECTURE, from A1
find it ironic and sad that Arab 
journalists have to go to a Jew
ish newspaper to work.
Despite those discouraging 
facts, Toameh didnt hesitate to 
mention his desire for a freer 
Palestinian media.
Once we [Palestinians] have 
free media, I will be the first per
son to go back, he said.
Toameh faced a number of 
questions from the crowd of 
about 75, some of whom were 
bewildered that a Palestinian 
journalist was able to look at the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 
such an objective perspective. 
Toameh told the audience that 
he had written articles about 
both the suffering of Palestin
ian people in the West Bank and 
Gaza strip as well as the massive 
amounts of corruption within 
the Palestinian government.
Why is it that when an Arab 
criticizes an Arab regime, he 
is accused of working for the 
CIA? Toameh responded. Im 
not here to defend Israel. Im not 
here to defend anyone. Do I have 
to apologize that I work for a
Jewish newspaper? Im proud.
When audience members 
criticized him for not accu
rately representing the conflict, 
Toameh emphasized his obli
gation as a news journalist to 
present the facts in the most 
objective way possible, but also 
admitted that youll never get 
a completely fair and balanced 
view.
Audience members were 
enthusiastic about Toamehs 
presentation.
What I really enjoyed about 
his presentation was that Toameh 
seemed to be displaced from 
emotion and could see things 
objectively, said Elliot Onn, a 
sophomore social and decision 
sciences major and member of 
Tartans for Israel. He wasnt de
fensive about his beliefs, and the 
knowledge and objectivity that 
he brought to the discussion el
evates the understanding of the 
issues.
The event was organized by 
Sahar Oz, Carnegie Mellons as
sistant dean of student affairs 
and assistant director of the Hillel Jewish University Center.
It seemed to me that the
programs most surprising ele
ment for many students was 
Khaleds approach, as formed 
by him not being a publicist or 
opinion columnist but rather a 
field reporter, said Oz. It was 
refreshing to engage in conver
sation with someone from that 
dying breed of reporter  the 
kind that reports on other people 
and events rather than making 
himself/herself the story.
Audience members hoped that 
Toamehs lecture would lead to 
increased support for bringing 
in more speakers to address the 
conflict in the Middle East.
I think we set a good prec
edent by bringing in Khaled, 
Onn said. We need more speak
ers who can address the issues of 
the Middle East from an objec
tive point of view, allowing us 
to understand the tomplexity of 
the region.
The event was sponsored by 
Tartans for Israel, the University 
Lecture Series, the Hillel Jewish 
University Center of Pittsburgh, 
Hasbara Fellowships, and the 
College Republicans.
Editors note: Elliot Onn is a ju
nior staffwriterfor The Tartan.

Participants reacted favor

Mosaic is a great program, 
said Irene Hanson Frieze,

How Things Work: Black Holes
A6___________________________________________________________________________________________THE TARTAN_______________________________________________________________________February 26, 2007
Sarah Mogin
Up there with the aliens from War 
of the Worlds, black holes are probably 
some of the more terrifying aspects of 
the universe.
Black holes form following the deaths 
of massive stars.
Throughout their lifetimes, stars are 
subject to their own gravitational fields 
in space. The gravitational fields create 
forces on the star.
One would expect this force to cause 
the star to collapse inward. However, 
there is an equally strong force in oppo
sition to this gravitational force.
Elements of a star
This latter force is caused by the fu
sion reactions taking place within the 
star. For the majority of the stars life
time, hydrogen fuses inside its core to 
create helium.
When the stars supply of hydrogen 
runs out, it becomes a red giant. The star 
initially expands and then shrinks to a 
helium core, at which point the helium 
atoms begin to fuse with other helium 
atoms to form carbon and oxygen.
In massive stars (those at least nine 
times as big as the sun) this process of 
expansion and contraction keeps go
ing; the red giant phase typically lasts 
between a few hundred thousand to one 
million years.
Following oxygen, the star produces 
neon, silicon, sulfur, and then iron. The 
star begins fusing the element that it has 
just produced after each expansion and 
contraction.
At the end of its life, the star will fuse 
multiple elements at once in onion-layer 
shells. The outermost shell will fuse hy
drogen, the original element.
Unlike the fusion of hydrogen, helium, 
and the other previous elements, the fu
sion of iron does not release energy. This 
is because each iron nucleus has a high 
binding energy, which is the amount of 
energy necessary to separate a nucleus 
into distinct parts.
Since energy is not released, the 
iron core continues to grow, even
tually becoming so massive that it
Black holes have a spherical surface 
called an event horizon, which is basi
cally the point of no return. One way to 
think of the event horizon is as the re
gion where the escape velocity is exactly 
equal to the speed of light.
Thus, it is impossible to exit a black 
hole after passing through its event ho
rizon. Once inside a black hole, an object 
approaches the singularity, or center. 
The travel time from the horizon to the 
singularity takes fewer than 10 seconds.
At first, the object is in free fall. Free 
fall is the same effect that makes astro
nauts orbiting the Earth feel weightless. 
Astronauts in free fall are unable to feel 
the Earths gravitational force because 
the force acts evenly throughout their 
bodies and on their surroundings.
If an astronaut were floating in a black 
hole, however, such weightlessness 
would not last for long. As the astronaut 
approached the singularity, the intense 
gravitational force would act much more 
strongly on whichever half of his or her 
body was closer.
Eventually, this difference in forces 
across the body would rip the astronaut 
into pieces.
Physicists typically use space-time co
ordinates, or a coordinate system that 
tracks an objects position in both space 
and time. Once inside the event horizon 
of a black hole, though, these two quan
tities exchange roles. That is, through 
the event horizon, space becomes time
like and time becomes space-like.
Normally, the progression of time 
is inevitable. A person continually ap
proaches the future, no matter what.
Inside of a black hole, however, the 
shrinking of distance, rather than the 
passing of time, is the inevitable quan
tity. The distance between a trapped 
object and the singularity continues to 
shrink, and this process is as definite as 
seconds ticking off a clock. Similarly, 
the event horizon becomes the definite 
past, something the object inside may 
never return to.
The moral of the story is that when 
the future appears to be looming in the 
distance, be glad its not a black hole.

Researchers create 
electric chain mail
Researchers from the University 
of Illinois have created a fabric 
composed of microscopic rings 
and links akin to chain mail. The 
links and rings are electroplated 
with aluminum and copper and 
photoresist, causing them to 
have unique electrical and me
chanical properties.
The chain mail construction al
lows the copper fabric to bend in 
two different directions, allow
ing it to take the shape of curved 
surfaces without wrinkling. 
Movement of the fabric causes 
changes in the electrical conduc
tion properties, allowing it to be 
used as an electrical device.
The fabric is a flexible 
MicroElectro-Mechanical Sys
tems (MEMS) device that could 
potentially be used in cloth
ing to detect vital signs, locate 
bullet wounds, or provide an 
information network for soldiers 
on a dispersed battleground, ac
cording to researchers from the 
Georgia Institute of Technology.

ADHD medications 
must have warnings
The Food and Drug Admin
istration (FDA) instructed the 
manufacturers of Ritalin, Adderall, Strattera, and all other 
drugs for attention deficit/hy
peractivity disorder to create 
guides warning patients and 
parents of potential risks of in
gesting the medicine. These 
risks include sudden death as 
well as cardiovascular and psy
chiatric problems.
The alerts suggest to patients 
what they can do to to avoid 
such problems. This recom
mendation was made by two 
FDA panels about one year 
before implementation last 
Wednesday.

Astronauts fix 
ships antenna
A U.S. and Russian team 
fixed an antenna on a cargo 
ship docked at the International 
Space Station (ISS) last Thurs
day. The antenna, which did 
not properly retract during the 
final approach of the cargo ship 
Progress, might have interfered 
with the process of undocking in 
April.
Commander Michael LopezAlegria and ISS Flight Engineer 
Mikhail Tyurin released the an
tenna from its original support. 
The astronauts then provided 
new support for the antenna 
with wires. This construction 
provided the ships enough space 
to undock.
During the spacewalk, the 
cooling system on Tyurins spacesuit system was not functioning 
properly. However, the crew 
still successfully accomplished 
other jobs on the space mission, 
including taking photographs of 
various pieces of hardware. This 
was the crews fifth and final 
spacewalk.

collapses inward. Following this col
lapse, a shockwave causes a supernova, 
which is an extremely bright explosion 
of matter.
This explosion causes the majority of 
the stars matter to blow off into space, 
leaving a core that is both massive and 
compressed.
Decreasing to a radius of 10 to 20 ki
lometers, most massive stars collapse 
to form neutron stars, which are small 
but extremely massive (1.3 to two solar 
masses). Very large stars, however, col
lapse to form black holes.
Hence, a black hole is an enormously 
massive region condensed to a small 
radius. The effect of this dense strucure 
is an extremely strong gravitational pull 
that even light cannot escape.
The great escape
Most students in elementary phys
ics are taught that what comes up must
come down. In other words, if one 
throws a ball into the air, one expects it 
to fall back down towards the ground.
Well, if one were to launch that same 
ball at a speed of 11.2 kilometers per 
second (roughly 25,000 mph), it would 
not return. This value is what is known 
as the Earths escape velocity, the speed 
necessary for an object to overcome the 
Earths gravitational force.
Escape velocities are dependent on 
the distance to an object and the objects 
mass. If the Earth were more massive, 
it would have a higher escape velocity. 
Similarly, if the Earth were condensed 
to a smaller radius, its escape velocity 
would also increase.
Combining large masses with small 
radii, black holes have escape velocities 
larger than even the speed of light. The 
speed of light is basically the de facto 
speed limit for the known universe; 
since nothing can surpass it, nothing can 
escape a black hole.
Professor makes presentation on carbon control policy
by Michael M. Whiston
Science & Technology Editor
Engineering and Public Policy Professor 
Jay Apt made a presentation on February 
18 to the Association for the Advancement 
of Science on U.S. carbon control policy, 
touching on the possible benefits of enact
ing such a policy.
In his presentation, which was entitled 
Controlling Carbon in the United States 
Electric Power Sector, Apt claimed that 
failure to enact carbon control policies in
the near future may have significant eco
nomic costs for the United States.
In particular, Apt differentiated be
tween emissions and concentrations of 
carbon dioxide. Emissions are produced 
by the factory, he said, whereas concen
trations measure the amount of substance 
that exists in the atmosphere.
According to Apt, 20 percent of carbon 
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere 
originated from emissions in the United 
States.
[Carbon dioxide] stays in the atmo
sphere for a long time, said Apt. Thats
completely different than conventional 
pollutants such as sulfur dioxide.
Apt said that the United States emits the 
largest single share of carbon dioxide in 
the world.
We ought to step up to the plate and 
clean it up, he said. Apt said that the elec
tric power industry emits the most carbon 
dioxide of all United States industries.
In fact, according to a report co-authored 
by Apt titled, The U.S. Electric Power Sec
tor and Climate Change Mitigation, the 
U.S. electric industry outputs 38 percent 
of the countrys total carbon emissions.
The other aspect of carbon control pol
icy is demand. Apt said that there will be a 
40 percent demand growth for electricity 
by 2025 if the United States maintains its 
upward trend.
Morgan Granger, director of Carnegie 
Mellons Climate Decision Making Center, 
said that many people do not understand 
that oil, coal, and natural gas, which are 
burned for electricity, are the primary 
causes of climate change.

Pitt develops molecule that fights cancer cell growth
by Shweta Kumar
Stqffwriter
A team of researchers from 
the University of Pittsburgh 
has just developed a synthetic 
anti-cancer molecule called 
meayamycin, which will suppos
edly be more powerful than the 
leading cancer drugs.
The team is led by Kazunori 
Koide, an associate professor 
in Pitts Department of Chem
istry whose research focuses 
on organic synthesis of natural 
products, new synthetic meth
ods, diversity-oriented synthesis, 
and organic fluorescent sensors.
According to Koides web
site, his research team is cur
rently studying FR901464, a 
natural product that regulates 
cancer-related genes by novel 
mechanisms.
Similar to other cancer drugs, 
meayamycin stops the growth 
and proliferation of cancer cells. 
However, once the project is 
complete, researchers suspect 
that this treatment will be 10 to 
100 times stronger than similar 
drugs.
The need for FR901464 stems 
from a lack of variety in chemo
therapeutic agents, or chemicals 
that are used by doctors to treat 
cancer.
In the labs research report, 
Koide stated, Currently avail
able chemotherapeutic methods 
are limited to targeting DNA, 
nuclear hormone receptors, a ty
rosine kinase, a proteasome, and 
the micro tubule.
In other words, there is 
currently a shortcoming of 
pharmacological treament in 
targeting tumorigenesis, or the 
formation of tumors, Koide said.
After researching the trea
ment mechanisms of FR901464, 
researchers have developed an 
analog of the molecule, called 
meayamycin. Because it is ex
ceptionally active, meayamycin 
can hinder cell proliferation at a 
concentration of 10 particulate 
matter (pM).
According to Koide, this 
concentration is analogous to 
a small packet of sugar from 
a coffeeshop placed in 400 
Olympic-Size swimming pools.
In order to develop a more 
stable analog, the research team 
studied the decomposition path
ways of FR901464. To ensure 
that this decomposition pathway 
did not occur, a right fragment 
[of the material] was rationally 
designed and synthesized.
Researchers then used this 
stable analogue to form meaya
mycin in 13 steps.
Unlike similar cancer treaments, meayamycin doesnotbind 
to DNA, Koide said. Accoding to 
, Koide, FR901464 works by low
ering the mRNA levels of various 
genes, including oncogenes, 
which are responsible for form
ing malignant tumors.
At the moment, research
ers are trying to figure out how 
to prepare a larger form of this 
analogue.

population thought that nuclear 
power was a contribution to 
climate change, he said, even 
though nuclear plants do not 
emit any carbon dioxide.
In his presentation, Apt said 
that there are alternative, de
carbonated sources of energy, 
such as hydroelectric sources 
and coal gasification. He said 
that these energy sources can be 
used by power plants in place of 
fossil fuels.
Morgan said, In order to sta
bilize concentrations, the worlds 
going to have a have a dra
matic reduction ... in total C02 
emissions.
Apt said that 28 percent of U.S. 
electric power is low-carbon, but 
this figure is dropping.
Demand growth is diluting 
the amount of low-carbon power 
we have, Apt said.
According to Apt, the future of 
carbon emissions in the United 
States depends on how new 
plants are constructed.
In particular, industrialists 
may choose to replace older 
power plants with plants of the 
same type, or they may construct 
new, low-carbon plants.
According to Granger, the use 
of low-carbon technologies in 
new, high-emissions plants will 
cost more than simply construct
ing new plants that emit lower 
carbon levels.
Youre making a decision 
thats going to affect the next 
hundred years, said Apt.
In his forthcoming paper on 
carbon control policy, Apt said 
that carbon emissions can be re
duced by setting standards for 
power plant emissions.
Granger said that while these 
regulations may increase elec
tricity prices, the economy can 
easily adapt to such changes.
Speaking of emission regu
lations, he said, Its certainly 
possible if you go about this in an 
orderly fashion.
Granger said that there are 
numerous other ways to control 
carbon emissions than impos
ing standards on power plants. 
The report on climate change 
mitigation, for instance, suggests 
finding more efficient ways to use 
electricity. It offers the example
Professor Jay Apt suggests setting standards to lower carbon emissions.
of combining fossil fuels with the 
use of wind energy.
In addition, Granger said that 
emissions standards could be 
placed on vehicles. He also noted, 
however, that carbon dioxide 
emissions from plants will be 
easier to regulate than emissions 
from cars, at least in the early 
stages. This is because there are 
far fewer power plants than cars 
in the U.S.
Another alternative is to re
place fossil fuels with renewable 
energies.
While renewable energies are 
a viable alternative, Apt said that 
one must be careful about substi
tuting these energy sources for 
carbon sources.
If youre not careful to address exactly what the problem 
is, youll get very expensive solu
tions, he said.
Apt said that individual states 
have already enacted carbon con
trol policies on power plants and 
that such policies may spread to 
the national level.
The Public Utilities Commis
sion of California, for instance, 
implemented the Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions Performance 
Standard in January of this year. 
Under this standard, investors 
can only invest in plants that emit 
less than 1100 pounds of C02 per 
megawatt-hour.
I eventually see a national car
bon legislation at some time.... I 
dont think its avoidable, said 
Apt.
Molecule rivals other treatment
CANCER, from A6
and stability of this analogue should facilitate our 
efforts to isolate cellular targets of FR901464.
One may wonder what this means for the future 
of cancer treatment.
Meayamycin offers alternative therapeutic ap
proaches that are currently not available. Its unique 
modes of action indicate that some of currently un
beatable cancers might be curable, Koide said.
In addition, the strength of this molecule means 
that cancer patients can use smaller doses of the 
drug in order to obtain the same effects as similar 
drugs such as Taxol. Extra strength may decrease 
the cost of receiving treatment, as well as any side 
effects.
The Koide lab has been working on the de
velopment of this molecule for six years, with 
endowments and sponsorship from the University 
of Pittsburgh, UPMC, the American Chemical Soci
ety, the American Cancer Society, and the National 
Institutes of Health.
A University of Pittsburgh press release stated,
In tests, meayamycin successfully worked against 
breast and cervical cancer cells as well as those 
from multidrug-resistant cancers.
Meayamycin may treat other cancers as well. 
The press release stated, It is based on a compound 
developed by a Japanese company to combat colon 
and lung cancer as well as leukemia. Meayamycin 
most likely works against those cancers, too, since 
the differences between it and the Japanese par
ent molecule are subtle except for meayamycins 
greater potency.
Researchers have also found that the molecule 
may work for patients whose cancers do not re
spond to pre-existing treatments.
Now that the molecule has been created, further 
development of the molecule is necessary to appre
ciate its properties, Koide said.
In particular, he said his labs next steps will be 
to determine tumor specificity in vitro and in vivo, 
and to study the pharmacokinetics of meayamycin. 
We will also determine the mode of action.
The labs findings will be published in the Journal 
of the American Chemical Society next month.

Stressful culture contributes to CAPS waitlist
Youd wait nine months for a baby to 
be born, a few weeks for your boots to 
be delivered, and one minute and 40 
seconds for your Hot Pocket to be thor
oughly cooked, but would you wait up to 
three weeks for counseling and psycho
logical services? If you looked into mak
ing an appointment at Carnegie Mellons 
Counseling and Psychological Services 
(CAPS) recently, you may have found 
the waitlist to be about that long.
At first glance, its easy to criticize 
CAPS  who can wait more than a 
few days if they have a serious emo
tional or psychological problem? Still, 
CAPS does provide a phone number for 
emergencies, available 24/7, and CAPS 
will schedule same-day appointments 
within their office hours if necessary for 
a students well-being. But knowing that 
theres a wait for appointments can be 
discouraging to someone with a prob
lem. CAPS does a service to the campus 
community by offering 12 free counsel
ing sessions per student per year, but 
once you use the 12, youre left search
ing for other alternatives.
On their websites, other universities 
like Case Western, Brown, MIT, and
Johns Hopkins list several reasons that 
students seek out their on-campus coun
seling services, which generally include 
relationship problems, academic stress, 
anxiety and depression, loneliness, sui
cidal thoughts, eating disorders, and 
substance abuse. Carnegie Mellons 
CAPS website also includes reasons like 
assertiveness, perfectionism, procrasti
nation, self-confidence, stress manage
ment, and time management as Com
mon Concerns for students on campus.
No college should have an environ
ment Where perfectionism, self-confi
dence, and stressand time-management issues are so prevalent. What kind 
of culture have we created at Carnegie 
Mellon that these are common concerns 
 so common that CAPS sometimes 
gets backlogged for weeks?
Its popular campus culture to com
petitively complain about how much 
work you have. We need to stop associ
ating work, and the time associated with 
our work, with our self-worth. It starts 
a domino effect into other parts of our 
lives; for instance, extensive amounts of 
work inhibit the ability to form healthy 
relationships, which can keep us from
being lonely. As a campus community, 
we are handicapping ourselves by think
ing that Carnegie Mellon equates to 
sleepless nights. Our peers are moti
vating each other to a destructive level, 
and its time for that to change.
Its not just students affecting stu
dents, though. Some professors are 
ignorant to the amount of work their 
students have in other classes, and are 
quick to dismiss extracurriculars that 
can be just as influential, instructive, 
and important to learning as classwork 
is. Professors who are open to accepting 
late papers and projects on the condition 
that students explain their work situa
tion can be a godsend. To have more un
derstanding professors would help how 
we handle our work loads, and in turn 
how we feel about ourselves.
Now is the nexus of stress-induced 
anxiety for students, as midterms are 
upon us. Use the time you spend telling 
people about all the work you have to do 
to just do your work. Professors, please 
recognize that yours is not the only class 
we have. We need to help ourselves, so 
that CAPS can function to its fullest po
tential.
Student body leaders enact unworkable plan
Dont naively trust your fellow 
man. Fliers advising just that have 
been hanging in the UCs girls locker 
room since August, when two thefts oc
curred there on the same day.
Unfortunately, trusting our fellow 
man is exactly what Karl Sjogren and 
Andrea Hamilton intend to do. Their 
newest initiative, the Public Rec Pro
gram Pilot Study, is set to start in late 
March or early April. The program is in
tended to help students get to class on 
time, encourage outdoor activities, and 
increase the accessibility of places like 
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. Oh yeah, 
and to test the limits of our communitys 
moral code.
The plan: Distribute 45 bikes and 
10 containers of outdoor equipment 
throughout the campus for student use. 
Unlocked. The failsafe: The honor sys
tem. And plaid.
This program is impractical for an 
urban campus like Carnegie Mellons. 
Your fellow man is more than just 
your classmates, faculty members, and 
administrators  its an entire city. 
Theres no wall separating our campus 
from its surrounding area. Were not 
suggesting we need one; we just dont
think we should leave free toys and bikes 
throughout the campus, ripe for the tak
ing. Theft can happen at a party, it can 
happen in a dorm, and  as University 
Police has been eager to inform us  it 
can happen in a locker room. And if un
locked bikes and equipment boxes show 
up on campus,, it can certainly happen 
on the Cut.
Sjogren and Hamilton are opposed to 
the idea of installing card readers to the 
bike racks and boxes. Theyve cited that 
such an addition would cost more than 
it was worth. But isnt it a bigger waste 
of money to pay for 45 bikes and watch 
their numbers dwindle?
Part of the pilot is to paint the bikes, 
frisbees, and other items of gratis ath
letic equipment in the style of Tartan 
plaid. If the items are plaid-covered, 
Sjogren and Hamilton argued, nobody 
will want to steal them.
We see two problems with this. First 
of all, why would we want our campus 
to host a fleet of bicycles so ugly that no 
one would even steal them? Secondly, 
someone will want to steal them; before 
anyone has a chance to catch them plaid
handed, our guess is that the majority of 
thieves will be smart enough to invest
in a paint job. If you Google college, 
bicycles, and unlocked, the vast ma
jority of the results are university crime 
reports.
One example of a more appropriate 
school to host this kind of experiment 
is St. Marys College of Maryland. Lo
cated in rural St. Marys City, Md., the 
college has less than 2000 undergrads, 
according to CollegeBoard.com. As 
stated on St. Marys website, the school 
added 25 unlocked bicycles to its cam
pus in September of 2006 in an effort 
to go green. Its conceivable that at a 
certain type of school  both small and 
isolated from the outside world  such 
a plan would be a good one. But were 
not that type of school. Instituting poli
cies as if we were will not make us that 
type of school. That would be like wear
ing shorts and flip-flops in the winter in 
the hopes of sunny days.
Carnegie Mellon has a lot to offer, but 
we cant be everything. If students were 
looking for a cozy, leave-your-doors-unlocked kind of institution, they probably 
would have gone elsewhere. Sjogren 
and Hamiltons Public Rec Program Pi
lot Study will be a waste of money for 
our urban campus.
Anatomically correct word gets 
book banned from libraries
nty.
Marshall Roy
The undignified details notwith
standing, I remember when, as a very 
young boy, I learned the word scro
tum. (Conversely, I have no clue when 
I picked up the words dozen or so popculturally-sanctioned euphemisms.) I 
was instantly aware of a congruity be
tween the peculiar-sounding signifier 
and even more peculiar-looking signi
fied.
It makes perfect sense to me, then, 
that Susan Patron might include a very 
similar experience in her novel The 
Higher Power of Lucky, this years win-, 
ner of the Newbery Medal, which is the 
highest award in childrens literature. 
On the first page of her book, Patrons 
title character and heroine, Lucky Trim
ble, overhears someone mention that a 
snake bit his dog on the scrotum. Lucky, 
a tenacious 10-year-old, is fascinated 
and confused by the word.
However, many librarians and teach
ers across the country are finding their 
knickers hopelessly twisted over Pa
trons inclusion of the word scrotum. 
They find it gratuitous and inappropri
ate, and have banned the book from 
their schools and libraries.
What could they possibly be afraid 
of? A medical term supplanting all those 
classy euphemisms like junk (which 
subconsciously furthers the idea that 
genitals are dirty) and man grenade 
(which sounds to me like a pun-tastic 
title for a feminist essay on male sexual 
violence)? Do they dread the day when 
words like duty and pro bono lose 
their concomitant giggles? Are they pre
pared to give Balzac the axe, too?
Libraries and schools are the places 
where practical information is dissemi
nated, not censored. Surely there are 
things that 10- and 12-year-olds arent 
ready to learn, but the proper words 
for their own body parts are not among 
them.
Some teachers and librarians have
offered the excuse that the presence 
of scrotum will prompt awkward 
situations between naive students and 
their prim teachers. One elementary 
school librarian was quoted in The New 
York Times as saying, I dont think our 
teachers, or myself, want to do that 
vocabulary lesson.
If an elementary school teacher isnt 
equipped to handle questions of a sensi
tive nature, he or she should find a new 
career pronto, before some idle Mon
day morning wallops him or her with 
an out-of-nowhere Where do babies 
come from? or Why do I have to sleep 
at grandmas when Mommy and Daddy 
play the game with the car keys in the 
fish bowl? I should think Whats a 
scrotum? is one of the tamer queries a 
teacher might receive, and just as simple 
to answer: Ask your parents.
But I think it would be better to live 
in a world where the traditions of blushingly brushing certain body parts under 
the rug were obsolete. Refusing to name 
or acknowledge childrens genitals only 
mystifies and shames them, promoting 
ignorance and negative self-image.
A pretty good indicator exists of when 
to teach children the more intimate de
tails of their bodies: When a child has 
the self-awareness to ask, he or she is 
probably ready to know. Language ac
quisition is an amazing human process, 
one which some of the greatest modern 
writers (like James Joyce) have success
fully explored.
In the end, talented writers should 
never be penalized for the puritanical 
prejudices of others. Teachers and li
brarians who stand up against censor
ship are educators of the highest form, 
simultaneously performing the duties 
and validating the existence of their 
profession.
And Susan Patron in particular 
should be commended for having the 
balls to give her fictional preteen realis
tic thoughts and curiosities.

editor of The Tartan. He welcomes 
responses.
Recent readme article unoffensive to homosexuals
As a homosexual and a well-practiced 
sodomite, I would say in defense of re
adme that I feel neither mocked nor 
offended by the Sodomy Ban article. 
I was actually mildly amused by it and 
think it makes a good point  that the
arguing about outdoor smoking is just 
as impractical as the controversy on out
door sodomy.
Matt Aument 
First-year music major
Valuable campus satire is presented by readme
In response to the editorial about 
readmes Sodomy Ban article, I would 
like to make the following points:
First, I would like to point out that 
while readme may be receiving more 
funding than some other campus or
ganizations, it also prints out 700 to 
1000 copies of every issue it makes,, 
which costs the organization over $300 
per printing, readme gets more money 
because its basic operation costs more 
money. How many copies does the 
Oakland Review need to print? Certainly 
not $9000 worth.
Second, the graphic associated with 
the article that The Tartan claims impli
cates only gay men also shows a woman 
holding some sort of sex toy. Clearly, this 
graphic was meant as only a representa
tive sample of sodomy, which is a broad 
term encompassing heterosexual oral 
sex, homosexual sex, and bestiality. A 
simple search of the term sodomy on 
dictionary.com would have revealed 
this to the authors of last weeks letter.
Third, and most importantly, The 
Tartan has chosen to misrepresent the
obvious intention of the article by pick
ing out only the most elementary com
parison to smoking, completely missing 
the satirical content. The article com
pares smoking to sodomy in order to 
stress that both are the individuals pre
rogative. One can no more ban smoking 
than ban sodomy. On another level, the 
article implies that popular reaction to 
smoking in public is as if people are sod
omizing each other in public places, and 
that perhaps our campus should reserve 
its rage against smokers for more offen
sive things'.'
In closing, to respond to last weeks 
claim that The publication gives gay 
men cause to feel uneasy and unwel
come at Carnegie Mellon, I would ad
vise the authors to avoid claiming that 
any publication makes any population 
feel uneasy when they have neither 
stated that they are part of this popula
tion, nor have they polled said popula
tion, informally or otherwise.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 26, 2007
Point: Cyclists need to be more considerate
XlM
Kelly Cahill
Im a catastrophe in the morning. As I 
walk to class, Im typically saddled with 
a laptop, a school bag sagging under the 
weight of $400 worth of textbooks, and 
a large cup of coffee. Im probably run
ning a few minutes late. Im probably 
thinking about lots of super-intellectual 
things, like the subjectivity of morals or 
the affirmative action debate. Im prob
ably struggling not to spill coffee all over 
myself. Suddenly, a reckless bike rider 
speeds by, mere millimeters away from 
sideswiping me. I freak out. Coffees 
down the front of my shirt, Ive com
pletely forgotten the thesis statement I 
was working through, and Im in a thor
oughly disgusting mood.
Its high time for bike riders to stop 
terrorizing the campus walkways. Bik
ers seem to think that its okay for them 
to weave through dense pedestrian traf
fic at ridiculously high speeds. Its not 
okay. It is, in fact, extremely dangerous 
to pedestrians and bike riders alike. Get
ting to class should not be a treacherous 
game of dodge-the-bikers or dodge-thepedestrians. In walkers attempts not 
to get hit by bikers and bikers attempts 
not to hit walkers, things inevitably go 
awry. The biker ends up running into 
another pedestrian that he didnt see or 
the pedestrian trips or drops what shes 
carrying. Bikers are a distracting and de
structive force on the sidewalks.
The recent blitz of winter weather 
makes getting around on campus iiberdifficult for all of us as we struggle to 
remain upright on the sidewalks-turnedice-skating rinks. To add bikes to the mix 
is just a death wish. Speeding bikers are 
falling all over the place and taking pe
destrians down with them.
I get it that bike riders are saving the 
earth by biking to campus instead of 
driving, and I totally support that. But 
we pedestrians are doing our part, too. 
Weve also chosen to get around sans fos
sil fuel. Bikers and pedestrians should be 
friends, not enemies.
I have a bike and I dont ever feel the 
need to ride it on campus walkways. Our 
main campus is miniscule! Who needs to 
zoom around on a bike when anyone can 
walk from Donner to Scaife in less than 
10 minutes?
So lock your 10-speeds up when you 
get to campus, bike riders. The Univer
sity Center has plenty of bike racks where 
you can secure your Schwinns during 
the day while you traverse campus on 
foot. If you find it necessary to ride your 
bike at 20 miles per hour to Baker Hall, 
wake up earlier. If leaving your precious 
bike locked up at the UC while youre in 
CFA gives you separation anxiety, then 
at least walk your bike along pathways 
instead of slaloming around those of us 
who walk to class. And if you are so in 
love with your bike that youre unable 
to dislodge your bike seat from your 
buttocks, then at least stay off of the 
sidewalks that are most heavily used by 
pedestrians, like the diagonal route from 
the UC to Doherty Hall. Take Tech Street 
and then go through the parking lot to 
get to Porter/Baker and the library.
Were all in a hurry to get to class, but 
bike riders need to be more courteous 
about how they do it. My un-coffeestained shirts will thank you kindly.
Kelly Cahill (kcahill@J is Forum editor. 
The next bike rider that comes too close for 
comfort can expect to take a tumble.
Counterpoint: Pedestrians need to be less oblivious
A relaxing bicycle ride to class is usually 
just what I need to keep me sane as I pre
pare to sit through hours of classes. The bit 
of exercise and the fresh air clear my head 
and wake me up. That is, until Joe Oblivi
ous steps into my path just a few yards 
ahead without looking, forcing me to take 
evasive action. But as I adjust my course, 
the wandering pedestrian rejoins the land 
of the living, realizes what hes done, and 
tries to lunge out of the way. Instead, he 
moves directly back into my path. Cycling 
on campus is a gauntlet. Pedestrians need 
to wake up and realize that they dont own 
every square inch of cement on campus.
To be fair, there are plenty of pedestri
ans who are considerate and largely con
scious of their surroundings. I offer my 
thanks to those of you who re awake and 
aware. But there are also a lot of people 
who fumble around like they want me to 
crash and burn.
Every day, the many racks across campus 
are packed with locked-up bicycles. There
Elizabeth Liu/Art Staff
are hundreds of people who ride miles and 
miles to and from campus every day, as we 
try to contribute to an environmentally 
friendly world, get some exercise, and 
save time and money. And Carnegie Mel
lon policy affirms our right to use campus 
walkways to get to the bicycle racks where 
we park our bikes. Thats right. The paths 
across the Cut are ours too. So quit calling 
for some fascist bicycle ban.
In spite of what some alarmists claim, 
most cyclists ride carefully. We have to be 
especially careful, just to compensate for 
the erratic behavior of pedestrians.
The pathways are available for all of us 
to use, yet too many pedestrians pay no at
tention to their surroundings. As a result, 
we cyclists are constantly on the lookout 
for spastic pedestrians, prone to unpredictably changing direction or stepping 
out directly into a cyclists path. Is it really 
that hard to walk in a straight line and look 
where youre going? Thats all I ask.
Let me try to give two pointers on how 
to be a savvy walker. The first suggestion 
is simple: look up. Pedestrians on campus 
have a habit of fixing their gaze on the 
ground in front of them. I promise, noth
ing is going to emerge from the sidewalk 
and drag you under. But theres a good 
chance that another pedestrian or a cyclist 
is coming towards you as you walk along 
the path across the cut at 10:25 a.m.
Second, keep in mind that bicycles work 
in such a way that when cyclists turn, they 
have to turn along an arc. So, for a mo
ment, they may face in your direction. In 
that situation, whatever you do, dont freak 
out and start trying to avoid the cyclist like 
a kid playing dodgeball. Youll inevitably 
jump right into the bike. Instead, just walk 
straight. Its that easy.
Believe me, cyclists want to avoid you 
just as much as you want to avoid us.
Ill concede that there are some incon
siderate cyclists, and when Im not on my 
bike and speed racer zooms past I give a 
holler, too. They need to chill out. But 
thats a rare occurrence.
It shouldnt be too hard for walkers and 
cyclists to share the pathways. We try to 
do our part. We only ask that pedestrians 
show a modicum of courtesy by paying at
tention to where theyre walking.

Lessons from Hollywood: Rehab as a coming-of-age
Jihk.
Rachael Clemmons
Id like to begin by admitting 
that I am completely intrigued 
by the goings-on of Hollywood. 
When I tire of the monotonous 
day-to-day life of the Mellon, I re
treat to my gossip blogs and soak 
it all in. And my guilty pleasure 
has led me to a solid conclusion: 
If youre ready for rehab, youre 
ready for womanhood.
Thats right, Young America. 
The generation after us that re
lies on the Britney Spearses and 
Lindsay Lohans as role models 
is preparing for a bleak life
style within the next few years. 
Surely, a spectacle awaits. Be
cause rehab is the new cool. All 
the celebrities are checking into 
rehab for one reason or another: 
Addictions to an assortment of 
drugs and alcohol are running 
rampant.
Maybe crazy is also the new 
cool. Britney Spears is crazy, and
also in rehab for the third time 
this month. Like so many others 
trapped in the tortuous sphere of 
stardom, she entered rehab only 
to escape its confinement less 
than 24 hours later. Unlike the 
others, she also shed the confine
ment of her hair. Now shes bald. 
If crazy is cool, Britneys on top 
of Hollywood.
What started it all with the 
Toxic has-been? Probably that 
whole Justin Timberlake mess. He 
made a song about her infidelity
 for shame!  and rose to solo 
superstardom. Spears mightve 
thought she was making Timber
lake jealous by getting married to 
a grimy back-up dancer, rising to 
the top of the trashy meter, and 
getting knocked up. Recently, 
Baldie even attacked someone 
with an umbrella. Yeah, you re
ally showed him, Britney. I bet 
Timberlake is crying in a corner, 
regretting Cry Me A River, and 
maybe even What Goes Around/ 
Comes Around. I bet.
Shes not a girl, not yet a woman
 despite her two toddlers. I
thought that bearing children 
made a woman more mature, 
but Spears has reverted back to 
her unfulfilled adolescent years. 
If our beloved, lost little girl can 
stay in rehab for more than 24 
hours this time, Im sure she will 
emerge a full-fledged woman 
(with a pixie haircut, of course). 
If weve learned anything from 
celebrity culture, its that rehab 
fixes everything.
Unfortunately, Baldie didnt 
start the Rehab Coalition. Shes 
just one on a long list of other 
girls-turned-women by their 
frequent visits to centers to 
cure their equally long list of 
addictions. Lindsay Lohan, our 
favorite chain-smoking diva, 
publicly entered Alcoholics 
Anonymous (AA) and a center 
to cure such addiction. She spent 
30 days in the place and left re
freshed and renewed, all before 
her 21st birthday. Someone give 
that girl a pat on the back! Well 
choose to ignore her frequent 
visits to Starbucks and other 
popular paparazzi haunts while
she was checked into the facility. 
A girl does need her coffee, you 
know. Clearly, rehab is useful: 
The Lohan has been constantly 
partying since she was released 
from the center. People can party 
without drinking! Not everyone 
lives in Pittsburgh.
My personal favorite is Nicole 
Richie. And despite what you 
might have read, she has been 
eating! Why else would that 
twin from Good Charlotte leave 
the ever-diminishing Hilary Duff 
and replace her with Richie? Oh, 
right.
Anyway, the reality star  socalled because I cant remember 
why she is famous  has been 
to rehab for some reason. It may 
have been the heroin they found 
on her in 2003, or the recent eat
ing disorder accusations. Who 
cares? Shes a woman now! Se
riously, she dresses a lot better 
than when she first appeared on 
The Simple Life. Rehab has done 
her some good! Now only if she 
could escape that DUI thing and 
none-too-pleasant mug shot.
Rehab is the new cool. Rehab 
is a rite of passage. Even that 
Olsen twin was in rehab for 
whatever reason. Cocaine? An
orexia? Mental scarring from 
Full House? Mischa Bartons little 
sister, whose name I find confus
ing and irrelevant, just admitted 
herself to rehab for an addiction 
to prescription drugs, all in cel
ebration of her 19th birthday. 
Shes all grown up.
Will our little sisters grow up 
thinking that rehab is the key 
to the smooth transition  be
tween awkward adolescence 
and wonderful womanhood? 
Lets hope so! Look at how 
magnificently these women have 
turned out!
Oh wait, thats right. They are 
all completely crazy. And this 
time, I definitely do not mean 
cool.

Resources 
to plan your 
academic future
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
There are many resources 
around campus that can help you 
design your own educational ex
perience, but you need to know 
where to look. We suggest the 
following options:
The Career Center
Its a good idea to start plan
ning your post-graduate career 
path early, and its an even bet
ter idea to get job and intern
ship experience during your four 
years of college. Located in the 
basement of the UC, the Career 
Center has specialists who meet 
with students to provide resume 
and job advice tailored to specific 
majors. To book an appointment, 
e-mail career@andrew.cmu.edu. 
Walk-in advising is also available 
on Wednesdays 2-4 p.m.
The Office of International 
Education (OIE)
Luckily for us, Carnegie Mel
lon encourages students to study 
abroad. Going abroad is an ex
tremely rewarding experience 
and a great chance to see another 
part of the world while earning 
college credits. Although the ease 
of studying abroad may vary by 
department, most students will 
be able to make it work if they 
seize the opportunity. You can 
study in a foreign country dur
ing the school year or during the 
summer for extra credits. Our 
school has resources to help you 
plan your trip. The first step is to 
make an appointment with OIE 
(e-mail goabroad@andrew.cmu. 
edu), located on the third floor 
of Warner Hall. In the meantime, 
ask friends in your department 
about their study abroad experi
ences and search the web to find 
out what countries and programs 
interest you.
The Fellowship Resource 
Advising Center
How will you fund your 
study abroad experience? Do 
you need extra money for tu
ition or summer internships? 
Are you already thinking about 
graduate school and fellow
ships after college? One of the 
offices that can help you to find 
funding is called the Fellow
ship Resource Advising Council 
(FRAC), located in Warner Hall. 
The Undergraduate Resource 
Office (URO), which operates 
closely with FRAC, can also help 
students find funding for under
graduate research. Besides fund
ing, applying for grants is great 
practice in writing and present
ing yourself, and a fantastic way 
to build your resume. To make an 
appointment with FRAC, e-mail 
jzang@cmu.edu. To contact the 
URO, e-mail sw4s@andrew.cmu. 
edu.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 26, 2007Ail
Club Sports Roundup
CLUB, from Al 2
season.
Carnegie Mellon fell behind
1-0 early in the first period, 
before sophomore defenseman Diego Taccioli scored on 
a power-play rush to even the 
score. First-year forward Rorry 
Brenner gave the Tartans a 2-1 
lead when his wrist shot from
the right face-off circle hit the 
net. Bucknell took control of the 
game from that point on, scoring 
nine more goals, and leaving the 
Tartans empty-handed for the 
rest of the game.
The Tartans will play in the 
first round of the College Hockey 
Association playoffs on Friday 
night at Hilbert College in Ham
burg, NY.
Mens basketball finishes 
its season with a loss
MENS, from A12
a first-year on last years senior
laden team, Einwag stepped in 
this season and led the Tartans 
in scoring and rebounding, aver
aging 15.5 points per game (ppg) 
and 6.0 rebounds per game.
Kozak, the lone returning 
starter from last year, upped his 
scoring average, this season to
11.3 ppg and led the team with 
3.4 assists per game. Matta av
eraged 10.1 ppg and was the 
teams best free throw shooter at 
79.6 percent.
I really feel like weve made 
some great strides these past 
four years, Matta said. The 
players have dedicated a lot to it,
but its really been [because of] 
the coaches and the coaching 
staff that this turnaround has 
happened. Our success has been 
a direct result of how much time 
and effort Coach Wingen, Coach 
Byrne, Coach Pastorkovich, and 
Coach Pietras have put in to this 
program. It doesnt get noticed 
enough ... how dedicated Coach 
Wingen is.... The success were 
having is due to his dedication, 
his motivation and all his effort 
that hes put in.
The Tartans finish the regular 
season with a record of 12-12 
overall and 5-9 in the UAA. The 
Tartans will find out today if they 
have earned a bid to the ECAC 
South Region Tournament.
Womens basketball team 
ends with a losing streak
WOMENS, from A12
10 points. Sophomore forward 
Ashley Rothwell led the Tartans 
with nine rebounds..
The Tartans were 
out-rebounded 42-30 in the 
game and Carnegie Mellon com
mitted 24 turnovers compared 
to Rochesters 18.
We were still a young team 
and I know that we will do amaz
ing things next year, Darcher 
said. With a healthy sophomore 
class these girls are going to not 
only beat a few UAA teams, but 
do some damage. I dont think 
the girls realize their potential, 
but next year they should be
ready to be contenders for the 
title. Our competition will for
get about us as contenders', and 
thats their mistake.
Feola finished as the leading 
scorer for the Tartans on the sea
son, averaging 11.3 points per 
game (ppg). Rothwell averaged 
10.5 ppg and sophomore point 
guard Stacie Aleski averaged 
10.0.
I am going to miss being a 
Tartan, Darcher said. These 
last four years have been very 
memorable and I dont want 
them to end.
The Tartans finish the season 
with a record of 8-17 overall and
2-12 in the UAA.
Tennis teams win another dual competition
then our coach was absolutely 
amazing, and set me up with 
an art student, so I came back 
a second time to look at the 
school academically. The art 
department here was just so 
incredible; I just couldnt not 
come here.
T: Have you developed any 
pre-match rituals?
M: We actually kind of have a 
couple as a team. We always get 
the same snacks before a match: 
peanut butter and bananas. We 
also have this goofy high five 
thing that we try to do, but al
ways mess up.
T: As a first-year, how are you 
handling academics and ten
nis?
M: Sometimes its really hard. 
With art, it isnt just studying, 
and learning something, its 
putting tons of time into a piece, 
so its really just a lot of time 
and effort and knowing what 
you want to be doing.
T: Is there anywhere in par
ticular that youre excited to get 
to travel to during the season?
M: Were going to Califor
nia to train and compete over 
spring break, which should be 
a lot of fun. We go to Cleveland 
for the UAA championships in 
April, which should be fun too, 
but we miss most of Carnival so 
Im a little sad to be missing that 
my first year here.
T: Do you have any personal 
or team goals for the season?
M: I dont really have any 
personal goals, but itd be re
ally great for us to do well as a 
team. We have a really strong, 
confident team and we play re
ally well together. We dont play 
like a Division III team, and 
we have a lot of potential, so 
Im really excited to see how the 
season will go.
T: How do you feel about the 
mascot debate?
M: I want a mascot, because 
personally, I would love to 
be the mascot. Id like a high
lander, you know like a painted 
warrior, like something out of 
Braveheart, it could ride on a 
horse! That would be an amaz
ing mascot!
TENNIS, from A12
faces UAA opponent New York 
University.
We only have one loss so 
far and that was a very close 
and winnable match for us, so 
I think we are happy with our 
performance, Spero said. The 
California trip will tell us a lot 
about where we stand amongst 
the top teams in Division III, and 
of course we will look to have a 
great showing at the year-end 
NCAA championships.
Womens team
After sweeping every match 
against Case on Saturday after
noon, the womens team moved 
to 4-1 for the season.
In the number-one singles 
match, junior Amy Staloch easily

Stafjwriter
The womens tennis team has 
gone 3-0 to open the spring 
season, and has had two Uni
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) athletes of the week. One 
such athlete is first-year art stu
dent Andrea Meythaler. At all
three matches, Meythaler won 
in both individual and doubles 
play. Last week, The Tartan sat 
down with Meythaler to discuss 
her recent success and the rest 
of the tennis season.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing tennis, and how did you 
start playing competitively?
Meythaler: Well, tennis is 
a huge sport down in Florida. 
There are literally special acad
emies designated for tennis. I 
started hitting a ball around 
when I was about 6, and then 
started training and compet
ing when I was about 12.1 did 
play for my high school. I actu
ally played on the high school 
team from when I was in sev
enth grade until I graduated. 
High school tennis wasnt so 
much a big deal though; really it 
was just I had a coach and trav
eled around playing for state 
rankings.
T: Was it part of your decision 
to come to Carnegie Mellon?
M: Definitely. I first came 
here on a recruiting trip, and 
really enjoyed the school, and

Mens basketball falls 
to Yellowjackets 72-60
____________________________________February g6, 2007
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team let their quick 
start'go for naught against their 
host, the University of Roches
ter Yellowjackets, on Saturday, 
and Rochester prevailed 72-60 
in the final regular season game 
for both teams. The win moves 
Rochester to 18-7 overall and 
9-5 in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA).
Rochester relied on solid 
three-point shooting from its 
guards and surprisingly good 
free throw shooting from its big 
men to notch the victory and 
offset senior Tartan guard Brad 
Mattas career-high 22 points.
A layup from Matta and a 
three-pointer from junior guard 
Geoff Kozak gave the Tartans an 
early 5-0 lead that blossomed to 
13-3 after another Kozak layup 
with 15:27 remaining in the 
half.
The Yellowjackets narrowed 
the deficit some, but a free 
throw by first-year guard Jack 
Anderson at the 7:05 mark put 
the Tartans up 25-19. Roches
ter reeled off 13 straight points 
over the ensuing four minutes by 
controlling the tempo and mov
ing the ball well to set up open 
shots, turning a six-point deficit 
into a seven-point lead.
The Tartans managed to snap 
Rochesters scoring run with a 
jumper by Matta and went into 
halftime trailing the Yellowjack
ets 38-33.
It was our best start of the 
season by far, Matta said. It 
was really nice to see that we all
came ready to play. We didnt 
quit and we were ready to finish 
our last game.
Rochester began the second 
half with a run, scoring the first 
seven points to lead by double
digits at 45-33. After Rochester 
gained its biggest lead of the 
game at 57-40 with 11:26 re
maining, the Tartans buckled 
down and scored six straight 
points to keep it close.
Over the final ten minutes of 
the game, Carnegie Mellon had 
a few opportunities to cut the 
Rochester lead into single-digits 
but Rochester always had an an
swer for the Tartans.
They started to extend the 
lead and they got the upper hand 
in the first portion of the second 
half, Matta said. We didnt do a 
good job of closing out on their 
three-point shooters. Give Roch
ester credit, they found ways to 
get open and hit shots.
Matta led the team with 22 
points and sophomore forward 
Ryan Einwag added 13 points 
and a team-high seven rebounds. 
Anderson added nine points and 
two steals in the loss.
Something that really goes 
unnoticed is how difficult our 
conference is, Matta said. The 
bar is set for next year. We were 
a young team and these guys 
know they have the potential to 
win the conference. You cant 
just go on a little run; it takes a 
full game to beat the Chicagos 
and the NYUs. I have all the con
fidence that these guys realize 
that and theyre going to put the 
work in, in the off-season.

Pittsburgh needs a new arena to keep the Penguins
Doug Fricker
One of the hottest and most 
exciting teams in the entire Na
tional Hockey League calls the 
city of Pittsburgh its home  for 
the time being. The Pittsburgh 
Penguins have moved up into 
fifth place in the Eastern Confer
ence with 22 games remaining. 
Sadly, the confusing future of 
the Penguins is up in the air. The 
Penguins are (gasp!) exploring 
the possibility of relocating to 
another city, while trying to ne
gotiate a deal for a new arena in 
Pittsburgh.
The Penguins lease at Mel
lon Arena expires at the end 
of June and Penguins officials 
have stated that the 45-year-old 
building must be replaced for 
the Penguins to viably remain in 
the city.
A plan to build a new $290 
million arena in uptown Pitts
burgh was set up by Isle of 
Capri Casinos, but this plan fell 
apart on December 20 when 
Isle of Capri lost out on receiv
ing the citys sole slots license, 
putting the Penguins and owner 
Mario Lemieux in a precarious 
position.
Shortly after this news, 
Lemieux announced that the 
Penguins future in Pittsburgh 
was uncertain and relocation 
was a possibility.
Since this point, a Plan B 
option has been discussed be
tween Lemieux, Governor 
Edward G. Rendell and Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahl. The current 
option divides up the costs of 
the new arena. Slots winner 
Don Barden would contribute a 
portion of the funds, as would 
the state of Pennsylvania. The 
Penguins, however, would be 
responsible for paying a portion 
up front, as well as money an
nually. Lemieux, obviously not 
pleased with the offer, wants a 
better deal.
Lemieux met with Kansas City 
officials and Sprint Center rep
resentatives in January about 
moving the Penguins to Kansas. 
Kansas City officially made an 
impressive offer, which didnt 
require the Penguins to pay 
any rent or construction costs. 
Other destinations rumored to 
be under consideration include 
Portland, Houston, Winnipeg, 
and Tulsa.
It would be a tragedy for the 
Penguins to leave Pittsburgh, its
home since the teams formation 
in 1967.
Looking at the numbers, 
Pittsburgh is one of the NHLs 
strongest U.S. markets. Mellon 
Arena was 92 percent full last 
season, despite the Penguins 
finishing in last place; atten
dance is even higher this season. 
Also, the Penguins have no NBA 
team in town to draw fans and 
attention away, unlike some of 
the possible relocation cities.
On paper, the Penguins own
ership at this point would be 
getting a better deal relocating 
to Kansas City. But Kansas City?! 
The city was briefly home to an 
NHL expansion franchise in 
the mid-1970s but the city and 
hockey go together about as well 
as sandpaper and silk.
Governor Rendell announced 
in early February that an offer 
better than Plan B has been 
presented to Lemieux, in which 
the Penguins share of the costs 
had been greatly reduced. Still, 
there is no timetable for a deal 
and considerable work still 
needs to be done as talks have 
hit a snag. The Penguins have 
balked at sharing parking rev
enue and redevelopment rights 
for the Mellon Arena site.
I just dont see how some 
financial issues can completely 
outweigh the costs of taking 
away a citys storied hockey 
franchise.
The Pittsburgh fans support 
the Penguins, win or lose. Its 
not like theyre the Florida Mar
lins or the now defunct Montreal 
Expos. It made sense to relocate 
the Expos because the market in 
Montreal was about as lucrative 
as a hot dog stand in a commu
nity of vegetarians.
The Penguins and Lemieux 
initially said they would tell 
Kansas City officials by Febru
ary 4 whether they would move 
to the Sprint Center next season. 
That decision was postponed, 
and so we wait.
With the Penguins future up 
in the air, we dont know what 
will happen, but the thought of 
the Kansas City Penguins tak
ing the ice next season is an 
unpleasant one.
Lemieux needs to keep the 
Penguins in Pittsburgh and let 
the citizens enjoy a playoff run 
this season, without forcing 
them to sadly wonder whether 
theyre seeing the final games 
ever of the Pittsburgh Penguins 
franchise.

Womens 
basketball 
loses 72-57
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team wrapped up its 
2006-2007 season on Saturday 
with a trip to Rochester, N.Y., 
to play the 21st-ranked Univer
sity of Rochester Yellowjackets 
in University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) action. The Tartans 
strong start did not last as the 
Yellowjackets took the lead and 
pulled away to win the game 
72-57.
The Tartans started out hot 
and led 8-2 after a three-pointer 
by sophomore guard Stacie 
Aleski less than two minutes 
into the game. They held a slight 
advantage over the Yellowjack
ets throughout the majority of 
the first half. Every time Roch
ester took a lead, the Tartans 
answered with points of their 
own. The Tartans led 26-24 with 
4:23 left in the half before Roch
ester buckled down and reeled 
off an 11-2 run to go into halftime ahead 35-28.
Sophomore guard Colleen 
Light started the second half 
with a three-pointer to pull the 
Tartans within four points.
The following nine minutes 
proved to be the difference in 
the game, as Rochester scored 
20 straight points while the Tar
tans turned the ball over eight 
times and missed five straight 
shots. Over the final ten minutes 
the Tartans regained their form 
to outscore the Yellowjackets
26-17, at the end losing by 15 
points.
I dont remember most of the 
second half, senior guard Nora 
Darcher said about playing in 
her last game. It was a blur. You 
sit there thinking this is my last 
half and then its over and you 
dont even realize that its over. I 
think Im in denial, but I feel that
I have another season ahead of_ T>me.
Junior forward Leah Feola led 
the Tartans with 14 points and

Let Pittsburgh Steel Y}ur Heart
New book offers 250 Reasons to Love PittsburghEverything you need to know
Did you know that the Pittsburgh region is home 
to 466 bridges  more than any other city in the 
world? Regardless of whether you are a nativeborn Pittsburgher, permanent resident, or visitor, 
Joanne G. Sujanskys Pittsburgh Will Steel Your 
Heart: 250 Reasons to Love Pittsburgh should 
be an interesting read. Written to honor the 
citys 250th birthday in 2008, the book is packed 
with fun, amusing, and otherwise intriguing 
Pittsburgh facts, each intended to give every 
Pittsburgh resident something to brag about.
Sujanskys research on the Steel City includes 
some surprising information. Reason #244 states 
that in 1940 the residents of Pittsburgh offered a 
$1 million reward for the capture of Adolph Hitler. 
Additionally, according to reason #159, Pittsburgh 
has the largest nativity scene in the United 
States, rivaling that of Bethlehem.
On the other hand, some of Sujansky's reasons 
are somewhat counterproductive. For instance, 
not everyone would be proud of reason #70: 
"Christina Aguilera, a famous pop singer, 
graduated from North Allegheny High School.
Still, much of Sujanskys news is positive. In 
2003, USA Today Weekend Magazine named the 
nighttime view from Mt. Washington the second 
most beautiful place in America. And just last 
year, Esquire magazine rated Pittsburgh at the 
top of its Cities that Rock list, which considered 
all U.S. cities. Sujansky also reminds her reader 
of 1979, the year the Pirates won the World Series 
and the Steelers won the Super Bowl.
Besides Pittsburghs character and likability, 
Sujansky focuses in part on whats in Pittsburgh. 
Its the home of the National Aviary, the only bird 
zoo in the nation. Additionally, Pittsburgh is the 
only city with an airport displaying the skeleton 
of a 15-foot T. rex. Pittsburghs Carnegie Science 
Center is one of the top five science museums 
in the nation. And, if thats not enough: In 1967 
the Big Mac was invented in a McDonalds in 
Pittsburgh.
Sujansky also includes plenty of aesthetic reasons 
to love the Steel City; she has much to say about 
the wildlife, parks, trees, and scenic views that 
the area has to offer. Although Sujansky makes a 
great case for Pittsburgh's greenery, some of her 
other reasons seem to be a bit strained. One of 
her reasons, the Pierogies Race at PNC Park, is 
not as funny as she makes it out to be. Moreover, 
Sujansky writes that Pittsburgh's public pools are 
safe enough for patrons to leave their belongings 
unsupervised while swimming  a claim that 
hardly seems believable.
More than just Pittsburgh, Steel Your Heart also 
mentions Carnegie Mellon more than once among 
the 250 reasons: The university is the only place 
in the world to offer a Ph.D. in robotics. Also, film 
director George A. Romero attended Carnegie 
Mellon and later returned to Pittsburgh to film 
Night of the Living Dead.
Furthermore, Carnegie Mellon is in good 
company: Reason #76 reminds the reader 
that there are 44 colleges and universities in 
the Pittsburgh area. According to the book, 
Pittsburgh is the 18th most educated city in the 
United States; 33.6 percent of the population has 
a college degree or higher.
While reading Steel Your Heart, its easy to see 
why Sujanksy has been deemed the Ambassador 
of Pittsburgh by her friends and colleagues.
Her enthusiasm for the city and its intricacies 
is contagious. Still, clearer and more thorough 
explanations to the included facts could have 
really added to the work, which is currently 
more like a list than a book. For example, reason 
#126 simply reads, "Fabulous Parks. Including 
information about these parks  like their 
names, locations, and functions  could have 
strengthened her claim. As a result of the brevity 
of each fact, this book may not be the best source 
for promoting Pittsburgh; instead, it'may be 
better suited for natives of the Steel City.

About personal space invaders 
Dear Janet,
Last night while I was work
ing on something in my room, 
my housemates friend Dave 
barged into my room. Even 
though my housemate wasnt 
home, he told Dave that he 
could come over. Dave hung 
around my room the entire 
night, and I couldnt get any
thing done! I kept hinting, but he 
was totally oblivious to the fact 
that I wanted to be alone. This 
has happened before, but never 
to this extent. I dont want to be 
mean, because hes a nice guy, 
but I need my space!
Cannot Really Operate When 
Distracted Every Day
Dear CROWDED,
Wow. Thats really uncomfortable. 
Why dont you just tell your room
mate not to invite him over when 
hes not there? If that doesnt work, 
another option is to call a girlfriend 
over and discuss the relative merits 
of tampons vs. pads in front of him. 
Ive found this to be a surefire way to 
make a boy flee in terror. If he really 
wont leave your room, just tell him 
that you need to take a shower.
Still, Ive gotta tell you, I dont think 
hes coming over to wait for your 
housemate. In fact, 1 would ven
ture to say that hes there to see 
you, hotness! Your options are as 
follows: 1. Date him. 2. Reject him 
outright. 3. Try to discourage him
Did you know?
subtly in hopes that hell get the 
hint. Id go for the third suggestion 
in your situation, since it's a lot less 
awkward and awful for all those in
volved (though, to be sure, it is still 
both awkward and awful).
If he just really isnt getting the hint 
that youd rather be alone, you 
could try telling him that youre ap
plying for a really important intern
ship that you need to work on, and 
ask him nicely to chill out in the 
other room. Then close the door. 
If he won't leave and starts asking 
you about the internship, be really 
nice and gracious and everything, 
but just say, Im really sorry, but I 
cant concentrate with someone in 
the room.
Be insistent and be increasingly 
direct until he leaves. It may make 
you feel bad to be so blatant, but 
unfortunately, some people just will 
not get the hint until you make your 
needs clear. Talk to all of your room
mates and ask them not to invite 
him over when theyre not there, 
and ask them to (covertly) discour
age his crush if it comes up in con
versation. Remember, be nice and 
be courteous, and try to let him 
down gently.

opportunities, writing, and reading
and prose in Gladys Schmitt Center
Wednesday evening, an 
audience gathered in the 
Gladys Schmitt Creative 
Writing Center for readings 
by four student writers. 
Left: Senior BHA student 
Adam Jaffe. Right: Senior 
self-designed major Anna 
Vogelzang.
Creative writing:
Student writers perform poetry
Hidden away in Baker Hall is a designated nook for creative 
writing majors: the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center. 
Here, prose, poetry, and other forms of creative literary output 
roam freely as creative writing majors congregate on the 
sofas. Taught by accomplished (and widely published) faculty, 
the students are given free reign in regard to their curriculum, 
which allows them to explore many different styles of writing.
"There are certain classes you need to take  two surveys 
in different genres and four workshops  but we're mostly 
free to experiment, said Anne Marie Boots Rooney, a senior 
creative writing major with a focus in poetry. This method 
allows the students to decide the pace of their individual 
experiences with writing.
Carnegie Mellon is one of only a handful of colleges in the 
United States that offers a creative writing degree. The 
university is also set apart from other schools in that it does 
not offer a Masters of Fine Arts program for creative writing. 
This works out better for the undergraduates, however. We 
dont have [an MFA] program so the [undergraduate] creative 
writing program gets a lot more money, said Zach Harris, a 
senior creative writing major with a concentration in poetry 
and non-fiction. The money that the program receives funds 
activities for the creative writing majors, such as a trip to the 
Dodge Poetry Festival (one of the largest poetry festivals in the 
continental U.S.) in New Jersey.
CMU also provides its undergraduate body with many 
opportunities on campus. Students are encouraged to write 
theses (unlike other undergraduate creative writing programs 
at other universities) and work with the Carnegie Mellon 
University Press to help publish books. They also have ready 
access to the universitys Adamson Visiting Writer Series, a 
series of readings featuring mostly established writers from 
outside of Carnegie Mellon. This year, the theme is Alumni.
Additionally, the students have their own reading series, 
organized by Harris and Rooney. On average, readings 
are held once a month and ideally contain an even split 
between prose and poetry. Each event begins with the two 
hosts sharing a poem by a published author. Following an 
introduction by either Harris or Rooney, each reading is 10 
to 15 minutes long. Rows of seats replace the usual rocking
chairs and tables. The small area provides a sort of intimacy 
that is enhanced by the intentionally dimmed lighting.
Very romantic mood lighting, joked Harris. It's a very nice 
atmosphere.
A reading Wednesday featured two prose writers and two 
poetry writers, not all of whom were creative writing students.
Adam Jaffe, a senior BHA student majoring in piano 
performance and creative writing, went first. Most memorable 
was the tone of his poetry, which, for the most part, was very 
light and humorous. Sugar, youre a synonym of sustenance, 
he said, as he read from his poem "Dutchwoman Microwaves 
My Heart. Another poem, called An 11-Year-Old Boy Who 
Has Composed 5 Symphonies, relates to Jaffe's interests 
as a musician. Drawing on the interesting and imaginary, 
his poems discussed a variety of topics, in which whimsical 
travel fantasies, haircuts, and prescriptions danced in the 
limelight. Jaffe's tone, at first the most distinct aspect of his 
performance, wound up a bit too casual and untailored and 
was difficult to invest in emotionally.
The second reader was Brad Porter, a junior double majoring 
in creative writing and cognitive psychology. His presentation 
was about introductions, and so the introduction by Rooney 
and Harris was foregone in favor of Porter's prose: a 15-minute 
introduction of himself. His writing was deliberately stylistic: 
each sentence began with Brad Porter" or He" and offered, 
in the third person, some sort of personal detail.
Most interesting, however, were his reflections on the purpose 
of introductions. Porter demonstrated the different ways to 
introduce someoneas a recovering alcoholic, a man with 
experience in several different careers, a man with experience 
in several different careers only because he couldnt keep 
them long enough to build; a man who overcame lifethreatening injuries, coming to Carnegie Mellon at the age of 
28 after having dropped out of two other colleges; as a funny, 
touching, honest man. He showed how simple questions 
such as Where are you from?" can be difficult to answer. Full 
of contradictions, he was tom between expressing what a 
monster" he was and trying to establish "how good he was. 
In the end, he succeeded at both. Mostly, Porter displayed a 
clear desire for equilibrium that was sincerely affecting.
Next up was Anna Vogelzang, a senior creative music major 
(a self-designed major). She kicked off her show with three 
"winter poems, but her most notable piece was her Travel 
Poem." In this poem (her longest), she detailed her travels 
across the country. For Vogelzang, each city offered new 
grounds for explorations of her relationships with her family 
and friends: Her delivery was also exceptional  sometimes 
people forget that readings are also performances. Vogelzang 
kept it all together, resulting in a stellar exhibition of her work.
The final reader was Patrick Pettibon, a junior English major. 
His prose seemed similar to the literary stylings of Charles 
Frazier, author of Cold Mountain, with its acute attention to 
detail. Pettibon utilized many long, descriptive sentences 
that invoked very specific imagery. The narrator of Pettibon's 
piece tells a story while sitting at a bar, so the audience, in 
turn, learns the story second hand. The story was about a 
man named Tom who lived a very successful life, with a good 
business, a religious lifestyle, and an active involvement 
within his community. Later, Toms luck changes when his 
home catches fire, his company bums down, and he loses 
almost all of his financial assets.
The story culminates with a confrontation between Tom 
and his oldest son, Christopher, in which they discuss the 
definition of success. It was clever, but the heavy amount of 
detail sometimes detracted from the story in that the details 
almost became tangential sub-stories.
As is reflected in Wednesday's readings, those outside of 
the creative writing program are welcome to participate in 
the student reading series, by sharing or attending. The only 
requirement is that all readers must have achieved a B or 
higher in one Survey of Forms course. To participate, students 
should contact either Harris or Rooney. The next reading (to 
occur in March) is going to have a special theme in which the 
four performers will read each other's works, not their own. 
Flyers will be put up around campus, so keep watch!

The Harry Potter Withdrawl Club Paperhouse
Hardcore addicts get their kicks at Joseph-Beth Booksellers aUiMlal p Review of Kisses and Hugsa radio station
Twelve years ago, Joanne Rowling was simply a 
struggling British mother writing on napkins in a 
caf as her infant daughter slept. What was once just 
a dream has blossomed into possibly the greatest 
epic of this generation. On July 20,1997, Hairy 
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was released 
to the British public. The same year, U.S.-based 
publishing company Scholastic, Inc. offered Rowling 
an unprecedented $100,000 for the rights to publish 
her novel in the United States. In a runaway train of 
events, Harry Potter has become more than a novel or 
even a franchise  to some, it has become a lifestyle.
The members of Pittsburghs Harry Potter Withdrawal 
Club have adopted this lifestyle. Typically, Harry 
Potter books are released every two to three years, 
and are each read in two to three days, if that. The 
Harry Potter Withdrawal Club is a way to satiate 
Potterheads' hunger for more fantasy and help them 
cope with the downtime between book releases. On 
Saturday, the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club met at 
Joseph-Beth Booksellers in South Side Works for a 
reading and discussion of Edward Eagers The Time 
Garden.
Hali Bowser, a bookseller at Joseph-Beth, talked 
about the club and what it does. "The Harry Potter 
Withdrawal Club [is where we] have the kids who 
are pining away for the next Harry Potter book read a 
different [fantasy] book every month and then come 
in and discuss the book, she said. "At the end of 
each session, we also have some discussion about 
Harry Potter and what the kids think will happen in 
the next book. The book club routinely has events, 
providing book lists and hosting activities that get 
fans interested in other fantasy classics such as C.S. 
Lewis' The Chronicles ofNamia, Norton Juster's 
The Phantom Tollbooth, and Madeleine LEngles A 
Wrinkle in Time.
Indeed, Harry Potter fans are known to be boisterous, 
active, and obsessive. Before the release of the fourth 
book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it had been 
confirmed by Rowling that someone was going to die
 the first death of a character in any of the three 
previous HP books. Many fans devised all sorts of 
elaborate methods and even some mathematical ways 
to figure out of who it was going to be.
Additionally, midnight openings have become a 
tradition for many; for each book, people all over the 
world show up at their local bookstores to pick up 
reserved copies. Some arrive in character, dressed 
as anything from Fluffy the giant three-headed dog 
to Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who lives in a toilet. 
Non-subscribers to Harry Potter mania often fear for 
their lives if they mention even the slightest lack 
of enthusiasm for the books in front of any of these 
die-hard fans. Some serious fans even play "Muggle 
Quidditch, a grounded version of the wizard game 
played on broomsticks.
This summer, on July 21  exactly 10 years since the 
release of the first book  the seventh and final part 
in the series will be released worldwide. To be sure, 
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows guarantees 
the Harry Potter Withdrawal Club one final hit. After 
the shocking events of the sixth book, Harry Potter 
and the Half-Blood Prince, fans are going crazy over 
how everything will be solved in a novel smaller than 
the Encyclopedia Britannica. Undoubtedly, tears will 
fall as the final chapter unfolds. Ten years of wands, 
hippogriffs, Muggles, and Quidditch will culminate.
It will be the end of an era; it will be, in the words of 
Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, "Mischief 
managed."

Sometimes at WRCT we pick up random albums and just take a listen. 
We were attracted to Kisses and Hugss Positive Youth 1994!!! by its 
amazing and ridiculous yellow cover featuring a black kitten with a 
horseshoe, a guy in a ski mask, and  most entertainingly  the band 
members in action; they are obviously nerds. Below is a transcript of our 
conversation during our first listen through this album.
Alexander Smith: So midway through the second track, "Genital Ben," 
Im already wondering how this dudes voice hasnt given out.
Joannie Wu: Are these dudes playing in Josh Atlas basement? Cause 
it looks like it. I honestly dont hear any kazoo, mandolin, or sax, all of 
which they credit themselves with playing. Huh.
A: Who knows? Okay, now were up to "Holy Shit, which is like 45 
seconds long and actually pretty decent. These songs go by quickly.
J: This is like, super speedcore or something. If you play it at 33 instead 
of 45 it kind of sounds like nu-metal. Hilarious.
A: There goes the A side. The next track is Fuck Your Speclogics. Is 
that a word? I dont think its a word.
J: Misplaced Suicide Notes just sounds like nu-metal in general. Its 
kind of funny to read their little blurb on the cover hating on screamo 
[hardcore emo] because when they actually made the album in 1994 this 
music was still considered "fresh...Except they just left it under their beds 
or something for eight years and then decided to do a 500-copy limited 
vinyl release. Why do we even own this?
A: Cause it obviously rules. Also, half of the thanks to section on the 
back says RIP next to it. What the hell?
J: Maybe those are old defunct bands that they knew/were a part of.
God, Courier is a bad typeface to use.
A: Im fairly sure this band doesn't care about design at all. Look at them. 
Uh, this next song is a Negative Approach cover. But it sounds the same 
as all the others. Some of these riffs sound kind of like Slayer.
J: Oh! Theres all that kazoo/mandoiin/sax shit. Five seconds worth.
A: it was a good five seconds, though. And the last track, Why Do You 
Insist I Need College To Validate My Life, Fucker? is like seven seconds 
long and has only those lyrics. I like it  strong finish for the record.
J: Amazing. It speaks to me.

Open Stage Theatre presents Asparagus
Jeanne Drennans play about a screenwriter desperate for success
Running through March 11 at the Open Stage Theatre, 
Pittsburgh native Jeanne Drennan's Asparagus asks how 
much an artist should be willing to sacrifice in the name of 
art. A play about where to draw the line before ransacking 
the lives of others, Asparagus won an award at the Gemini 
Theaters new play competition.
Protagonist Emily (Judy Kaplan) is a screenwriter who is 
having trouble writing a new movie script. She finally finds 
inspiration after a visit from Art (John Gresh), who explains 
the true story of the murder of his daughter Lisa (Tiffany 
Hickman). Art wants Lisas murder to be made into a TV 
movie, in order to raise awareness and hopefully catch his 
daughters killer. Emily is at first skeptical about writing the 
screenplay for Arts TV movie, but agrees to listen to his 
story. She ends up incorporating details from the murder into 
her own movie plot.
As the story continues, Asparagus leads the viewer down 
several rabbit holes. Emilys own daughter (Molly, played 
by Madison Georgi) is at times grafted onto Lisa. The girls 
shared a common love of ballet, and, at one point, Molly 
comes close to getting assaulted in a New York City subway. 
Still, the discriminating viewer will see that Molly's fencing 
practice sets her apart as a strong female character able to
defend herself. Through Arts own admission, Molly is the 
smarter girl.
Although Emily incorporates some of the details of Lisa's 
gruesome murder into her screenplay, she keeps it a secret 
from Art. Here, the audience is asked to rationalize Emilys 
behavior as either furthering Arts cause or betraying his 
trust. If Asparagus ended here without a resolution, it could 
be a far stronger play; the audience would be left to decide 
whether Emily's actions are ultimately helpful or harmful.
Emily is not a callous offender. Her husband Joe (Tony 
Bingham), a painter, provides an example of betrayal in 
Emily's own life. Joe cheated on Emily once before with 
one of his models, and Asparagus hints that he may do so 
again when he goes away to Arizona for six weeks to teach 
painting.
Right before the screenplay is completed, Emily is fired. This 
comes at the hands of Barb Phillips (Lori Maxwell), Emilys 
friend of nearly 10 years. It is implied in the script that Barb 
knew that Emilys employment was in jeopardy; as a result, 
Emily feels betrayed. "Fuck reality," says Barb, essentially 
excusing her own-behavior. Emilys relationship with Barb 
serves to add an extra dimension of betrayal to the play.
Asparagus stage design helped to weave the story together 
in an interesting fashion. The three-quarter stage setup 
allowed for actors to enter and exit the performance space 
from behind the audience; at times, they were close enough 
to touch. Scenes sometimes occurred two at a time, as one 
character is telling a story and two others are acting it out. 
The transitions between scenes were often accompanied by 
pop music.
The Open Stage Theatre, a venue located in the Strip 
District, can accommodate intimate audiences of about 100 
people as it is set up for Asparagus. Although removed from 
Carnegie Mellon, the theater is ideal for small productions of 
local up-and-coming plays.

Byham cuts loose
Pittsburgh Musical Theater presents Footloose
Fans of the '80s in Pittsburgh now have a reason to cut 
loose...footloose!" The musical Footloose opened last Thursday 
at the Byham Theater in the Pittsburgh Cultural District. 
Footloose, based on the 1984 movie of the same name starring 
Kevin Bacon, is the story of a Chicago teen named Ren who is 
forced to move to a small town called Bomont.
But Bomont is no ordinary small town. Ren is shocked to find 
out that two of the things he loves are banned in Bomont: rock 
music and dancing.
These laws date back to a tragic time in the town's history, 
when drugs and alcohol led to the deaths of four teenagers 
in a car crash. The accident inspired reverend Shaw 
Moore, the town preacher, to enact the bans. Influenced by 
these laws, the town spends most of its time watching its 
teenagers to make sure theyre not up to mischief. Ren, the 
outsider, struggles with this and tries to adjust to the stifling 
regulations of the town, but he just cant handle it. As he 
professes in one of the first numbers of the musical, "I Can't 
Stand Still, living in a town so restrictive wont do him any 
good.
And it definitely doesn't. Ren develops a huge crush on the 
preacher's daughter, Ariel, who is too busy being a good girl 
to even give him the time of day  or is she? The second
number of the play, "The Girl Gets Around, tells the audience 
that Ariel isnt quite the angel everyone thinks she is. Her 
overprotective father, Reverend Moore, isn't thrilled when she 
eventually shows interest in Ren.
Right around that time, Ren decides that hes going to get 
rid of Bomonts archaic rules and hold a senior prom. Ren 
realizes that he needs to convince the town council to remove 
these laws. He uses proof from the Bible to make his case, 
but he still loses. In a heart-to-heart moment, Ren reminds 
the reverend of what its like to be young. Convinced, the 
reverend announces the following Sunday that he will allow 
the teens to hold a dance.
Footloose was presented by the Pittsburgh Musical Theater.
It starred Leo Ash Evens and Emily Lynne Miller as Ren and 
Ariel, respectively. Evens, a CFA alumnus, had an amazing 
voice and stage presence. Both Evens and Miller brought their 
characters to life, and the two worked excellently together. 
Throughout the musical, the chemistry between them was 
palpable. When they finally kissed, which was surprisingly 
late in the musical, there was a collective sigh from most 
of the audience. In addition, their conversations seemed to 
flow naturally; between the two of them, nothing was forced, 
which made the musical all the more interesting.
This isn't to say that there weren't actors that gave Evens and 
Miller a run for their money. One of the best performances was 
given by Michael Greer, who played Willard. Willard is Rens 
hot-tempered, bad-dancing, and categorically Southern best 
friend. Willard cant back down from a fight, yet he has huge 
problems stepping up to the plate when it comes to Rusty, 
the girl he likes. Willards number "Mama Says" was one of 
the high points of the evening. Plus, it taught the audience, 
and Ren, one very important lesson: "Once you drive up a 
mountain, you cant back down. Although the song itself is 
humorous, Greer's delivery made it amazing.
However, the play wouldnt have been Footloose without a 
show-stopping rendition of the title track. The entire cast 
shone as they performed the number during the senior 
prom. The choreography during Footloose" was also rather 
impressive.

GoldenEye
Wednesday, February 28
10 12:30
Some might say that being 
the best Bond movie of Pierce 
Brosnan's career is damning with 
faint praise. And in a way, theyre 
right; GoldenEye was leaps 
and bounds (or if you prefer, 
B.A.S.E. jumps and skydives) 
better than anything that came 
after it. Pierce Brosnan plays 
Bond, who is in the process 
of coping  along with his 
superiors  with the fall of the 
Soviet Union and the new world 
order. Of course, Sean Bean 
soon comes along and messes 
everything up by screwing over 
Russia and the West at the same 
time. Explosions, fist fights, and 
one hell of an entertaining tank 
rampage through St. Petersburg 
ensue. GoldenEye is one of the 
great Bond movies and if you 
haven't seen it, youre missing 
out.

Goldfinger
Thursday, March 1

In what has probably become 
one of the most archetypal spy 
movies of all time, Goldfinger 
pits a youthful Sean Connery (as 
Bond) against a boastful bad guy 
who gets his jollies by painting 
girls gold. Oh, right  there's the 
tiny Asian man with the razorsharp top hat and, of course, a 
horribly circuitous evil scheme.
Its James Bond, distilled into 
112 minutes of classic popcorn 
flick-age. Plus, after seeing it, 
youll better understand at least 
half the gags in every spy movie 
spoof made since 1964. Sounds 
like a good deal to me.
Dr. No
Friday, March 2
8 10 12
The first Bond movie ever! Dr.
No stars Sean Connery and is 
pretty much what anyone could 
expect from a Bond movie. Back 
then, though, it was a breath of 
fresh air, and  as we all know
 started a massive cultural 
phenomenon. Go back to Bonds 
roots at the peak of Bond Week 
in McConomy and check out 
Ursula Andress rising out of the 
ocean in a bikini, hunting knife 
in tow. Then ask your girlfriend 
to do it next time you go to the 
beach. Or not; I guess its really 
up to you.
Casino Royale (2006)
Saturday, March 3 
7:30 10 12:30
Did you like Batman Begins? Just 
like the 2005 hit about everyones 
favorite Caped Crusader, Casino 
Royale is a reboot of the James 
Bond franchise, with dramatically 
fewer silly one-liners, less deusex-machina gadgets, and... Texas 
hold' em? The most recent Bond 
film draws from Sir Ian Flemings 
first book about the charismatic 
super agent, but unfortunately 
some compromises had to be 
made; specifically, they changed 
the villains game of choice from 
baccarat to poker. The film tries 
to make hold em games look 
glamorous but the result is kind 
of hokey. The rest of the movie 
kicks prodigious amounts of ass, 
though, and its a breathtakingly 
engaging first try at the role of 
Bond for newcomer Daniel Craig. 
A blond Bond? Who would have 
expected it?
Casino Royale (1967)
Sunday, March 4 
7:30 10 12:30
Many people are unaware that 
this movie exists. Its not a James 
Bond movie, really, even though 
its based on Ian Flemings first 
Bond story. Its a parody of Bond 
films, starring Peter Sellers,
Woody Alien, and Orson Welles, 
and while it follows the same 
basic plot of Casino Royale, its 
basically a 70-minute collection of 
gags more than anything else; the 
movie had five different directors. 
Nevertheless, where else are you 
going to find a James Bond movie 
that stars Peter Sellers and Orson 
Welles? Actually, where else are 
you going to find ANY movie that 
stars them both?

* From Common Sense to the Internet
by Laura Thorn I Staffwriter
What exactly is a "zine? Think back to American history 
and Thomas Paines famous publication, Common Sense. 
Paines words challenged the British monarchy and 
reverberated within the hearts and minds of the American 
people. Common Sense exposed revolutionary ideas that 
would not have been accepted by American mass media
 had it existed at the time.
Today, zines function similarly. Covering topics that range 
from politics to sex, these homemade magazines are 
self-published and have minimal distribution, but are an 
important outlet for their writers. Zines are equally beneficial 
for their readers, who, through these eclectic and alternative 
magazines, become exposed to subjects that normally dont 
see the light of day in mainstream media.
Common Sense aside, the earliest form of a zine was the 
fanzine, or mini-magazine that die-hard fans of science 
fiction films created in the 1930s to publish information 
about their fandom, according to North West Zine Works. 
Today, the subject matter of zines has grown tremendously, 
as have the nicknames for the phenomenon. These include 
perzines (personal anecdotal-magazines), punk zines 
(referring to the musical genre and surrounding culture), and 
webzines or ezines (those published online).
The creation of todays zines began largely with the 
do-it-yourself (DIY) movement of the 1970s, fueled by the 
fervor of feminist and political organizations that had an 
agenda of reaching the public through alternate means 
of publication. Back then, underground zine culture was 
rooted in the support of one another, and that tradition has 
continued into the present. Zines often run advertisements 
and information about other zines, and editors help in the 
distribution of peer publications.
Zines can be free, but typically run from $1 to $5, depending 
on length and design. (For example, zines published in 
colored ink tend to cost more than black-and-white copies). 
There is no particular process for creating and distributing 
a zine. Most of the_ zine culture is underground, welcoming 
anyone to create his or her own homemade zine, which can 
then be distributed to friends or left in piles at local coffee 
shops.
Although many zines cover serious topics, some are created 
by high-schoolers desperate to let out their teenage angst, 
and others are written just for fun. Take Thrift Score, made 
by A1 Hoff, who wanted to create a more practical zine. Thrift 
Score informs thrift store shoppers of alternative places to 
buy their clothing. I guess I instinctively knew there was 
a subculture [in thrift store shopping] to be tapped. Now, I
know that for sure, Hoff said, as quoted in an interview on 
zinebook.com. "Starting the zine was also an excuse to do 
more thrifting for 'research' and whatnot. Some zines have 
the sole intention of finding and reviewing other zines, such 
as Factsheet Five. Created in the 1980s, Factsheet Five grew 
to become a nationally distributed magazine and is now 
published bimonthly.
Because of their small distributions, zines may be difficult 
to find for those who dont know where to look. The DIY 
magazines are most commonly found at coffee shops, thrift 
stores, music stores, book stores, and concerts. Additionally, 
students majoring in one of the social sciences might also 
be interested in looking at the various zines focusing on civil 
rights and alternative forms of government. The socialist 
Against the Current, In These Times, a leftist zine; and 
Dollars and Sense, which focuses on the economy, are all 
zines available both online and in print.
Zines can be found all over Pittsburgh. For a quick read close 
to the Carnegie Mellon campus, Kiva Han offers free zines, 
and the Caliban bookstore sells zines, including Encylopedia 
Destructica, an art zine created by Carnegie Mellon students. 
The Pittsburgh Zine Library and Archive, found at The Big 
Idea Infoshop, located at 504 Millvale Avenue in Bloomfield, 
has about 3000 zines organized by category. According to
8feature
pillbox 02.26.07

its website, [The Big Idea Infoshop] is dedicated 
to the active promotion of radical/alternative 
cultures through community networking and the 
distribution of literature. We hope to create a safe 
and accessible space for people to take part in an 
open and empowering community." Completely 
run by volunteers, The Big Idea Infoshop promotes 
alternative literature, including, but not limited to, 
literature that is woman-positive, queer-positive, 
and class-positive.
In addition to The Big Idea Infoshop, much of the 
city of Pittsburgh supports independent media, 
particularly through the Pittsburgh Indymedia 
center, which broadcasts events neglected by 
mainstream media in Western Pennsylvania. 
"Pittsburgh has a rich ethnic history and a small
town big-city feel, and a really strong underground 
punk population where most of the zines are 
coming from, said first-year art major and 
Pittsburgh native Robin Scheines. "Pittsburgh is 
also very artistically inclined. All of these factors 
create a strong zine presence in Pittsburgh."
The Internet has given zines a new look.
Webzines, or ezines, have become immensely
popular because there is no cost for printing and 
distribution and the Internet allows exposure to 
more readers. Websites have also given zines 
a classier, more polished look. While the cost of 
color ink drives the price of zines sky high, on the 
Internet, the design and layout can be as garish as 
one likes.
In the age of technology, many argue that print 
media will soon be extinct. However, for true 
zinesters, this is not a concern. Because zines 
began in the form of print, some argue that there 
will always be hardcopy zines. After all, print 
zines offer a homemade appeal, not to mention 
portability. Though not always as revolutionary 
as Common Sense, the zine will always be an 
important and fundamental form of self expression 
for artists, poets, and writers.

Philharmonic performs
Erich Kunzel guest conducts
Before conductor Erich Kunzel set the Pittsburgh Symphony Pops 
on fire and blew audiences away at Heinz Hall with a program of 
John Williamss film music, he achieved similarly exciting results 
with the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic.
Tuesday night, Kunzel was guest conductor of the Carnegie 
Mellon Philharmonic in a program featuring music by American 
composers: Leonard Bernsteins "Overture to Candide, Howard 
Hansons Symphony No. 2 Romantic, and orchestral selections 
from George Gershwin's opera, Porgy and Bess.
Leonard Bernstein, though often considered the first great American 
conductor, was also an important composer. As a conductor, 
Bernstein had many opportunities to conduct  and record  his 
own music. Bernstein recorded Overture" multiple times with the 
London Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, and 
others. Bernstein also recorded some of Gershwins music, even 
playing the piano and conducting in Rhapsody in Blue.
The Overture, which opened the concert, is full of excitement. The 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic gave a tiling and virtuosic  not 
to mention breathlessly fast-paced  performance. Near the end 
of the piece, the music changes both style and meter on a dime, a 
dangerous proposition for orchestras and guest conductors to pull 
off. In this, the Philharmonic was able to succeed.
Gershwins music is well-represented in Pittsburgh this season. 
The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic, as well as the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Pops has already performed his work, and the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra will play An American in Paris in 
May. Gershwin's music is often played by both Pops and classical 
orchestras because his music fits weir into each world. Gershwin 
brought jazz music into the concert hall with his famous Rhapsody 
in Blue, which pianist Kevin Cole performed masterfully in January 
with the Pittsburgh Symphony Pops.
Erich Kunzel and the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic gave a very 
amusing performance of selections from Porgy and Bess. Kunzels 
skilled conducting guided some very fine playing from Carnegie 
Mellons orchestra. The performance also featured a couple of nice 
touches, including a trio of saxophone players and Irvin Kauffman on 
banjo. Gershwins music is both tuneful and stylistically demanding. 
While Kunzels interpretation was exhilarating, he was too aggressive. 
The orchestra played all of the solos skillfully, although perhaps not 
as stylishly as possible.
As a composer, Howard Hanson made his biggest contribution to 
music and American culture through education, rather than his own 
compositions. Hanson was the first director of the revered Eastman 
School of Music in Rochester, New York, a position that he held for
40 years. There, he conducted and recorded a lot of his own music 
in addition to that of some other American composers.
Perhaps a bit brief, Hansons second symphony is 30 minutes 
in three movements. Titled Romantic, the symphony is rich in 
elegant melodies and explosive charges of happiness, although the 
whole affair is too easy: The piece is much less a journey than it is 
a big party. Kunzel and the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonics account 
was rather narcissistic; together, they gave a romantic account of 
the symphony at the expense of its darker elements. The playing, 
however, was spot-on, and the frequent horn solos were played 
with confidence and strength.

The Pittsburgh Symphony Pops plays John Williams
Usually, when the strains of John Williams tickle your 
ears, youre munching on $8 popcorn and trying to keep 
your shoes from sticking to the floor. That was not the 
case last week, however, when the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Pops, led by guest conductor Erich Kunzel, played a 
medley of Williams's greatest hits.
There was something surreal about hearing some of - 
the most famous movie scores ever written inside the 
glittering Heinz Hall  the booming of the "Imperial 
March from Star Wars rattling the theaters 14 
chandeliers. The people who looked most at home were 
not the season subscribers in pearls and animal-friendly 
faux fur, but the handful of twentysomethings dressed as 
Princess Leia and her Jedi escort.
The program began with the bright and brassy "Olympic 
Fanfare," one of Williams's four Olympic compositions.
As the last vibrations faded away, Kunzel turned to the 
audience and smiled. Isn't that power?" he said. The 
rest of the first halfs compositions, excluding the scores 
for Superman and Harry Potter, stemmed from Williams's 
collaborations with Steven Spielberg. The first piece, 
the theme from Jaws, sent chills through the audience 
even though the ocean was 400 miles away. Kunzel 
confided that the next piece, Bicycle Chase hom E.T. 
the Extra-Terrestrial, was his favorite. As the strings built 
to a triumphant flourish and sent E.T.'s bicycle past the 
moon, it was clear why.
The first half continued with the main theme from Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind. In the movie, scientists 
confronted with the quandary of trying to communicate 
with aliens turned to music, playing a sequence of five 
notes and encouraging the aliens to repeat them. It was 
on these five notes that Williams based the score. This 
was followed by Jurassic Park's main theme, which is 
surprisingly joyful. (At the beginning of the movie, after 
all, bringing back dinosaurs still seemed like a really good 
idea.) Next came Harrys Wondrous World from Harry 
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: a magical piece filled 
with trills and runs.
The show continued with a soaring rendition of the 
theme from Superman. Next came the highlight of the 
first half, the theme from Schindler's List, which featured
Last week, guest conductor 
to the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Pops Erich Kunzel lead both 
the John Williams concerts 
and the Carnegie Mellon 
Philharmonic's tribute to 
Bernstein, Hanson, and 
Gershwin.
a poignantly beautiful violin solo by Louis Lev. Indiana 
Jones topped off the set with "The Raiders March" from 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.
The second half of the show focused completely on 
music from Star Wars, beginning with The Phantom 
Menace and continuing to Return of the Jedi. "Duel of 
the Fates from Phantom Menace seemed a bit empty 
without the London Symphony Chorus, but the Pops 
version of "Princess Leias Theme was awe-inspiring. A 
surprising encore performance of the jazzy Mos Eisley 
Cantina" showcased the brass section and earned the 
Pops a second standing ovation.
The Pops performed brilliantly  Williamss pieces are a 
workout for every musician  and Kunzel was a treat to 
watch, throwing himself into each piece so much that he 
nearly jumped off the podium. His baton seemed more 
like a wand (and not just during the Harry Potter score), 
drawing piccolo trills and low drumbeats out of thin air. 
Although the show highlighted the best of Williamss 
work, its a pity the show didn't showcase any of his 
lesser-known scores, like the retro jazz of Catch Me if You 
Can or the minimalist mlange of The Long Goodbye.

The stars and the moon are predicting financial prosperity in your future. 
However, the horseshoes, clovers, and rainbows are saying otherwise.
Build your own horoscope: If the Oscar for Best Picture went to the 
movie you wanted, other things will also go your way. Otherwise, things 
will still work out the same way, but you will feel bad about it instead.
You will petition Carnegie Mellon to begin calling spring break spring 
semester break." While successful, youll get too caught up in arguing 
your case to actually make any plans for the week off.
Forewarning: it might not be the best time to visit your old high school. 
Walking down the halls, you will realize how much you hate everyone, 
then realize that not too long ago, you were just like them.
Pay close attention to the serving size suggestion on the box of Cheez-lts. 
You may want to eat more than 27 crackers, but doing so will actually 
be breaking a federal law.
Despite your best efforts, you will lose that pen that you really like. Start 
saying your goodbyes now, and just think of how it was going to run 
out of ink soon anyway.
It is okay to feel bad during February. However, it is also okay to feel 
bad for February. Doesnt it seem like January and March are acting 
very greedy by each having 31 full days?
Although clusters can get rather boring and lonely, its still not appropriate 
to pass the time singing along off-key with Justin Timberlake.
o-;:-:
Now would be a good time to scratch your nose. If its not redly itchy, 
just do it preemptively, or think of it as practice for later.

MO.s Pusha and Malice of the hip-hop duo Clipse are 
coming to Pittsburgh. The brother duo rhymes in a 
minimal framework that makes the dark rawness of the 
lyrics even more intense. Clipse is from Virginia Beach, 
Va., a town known more often as a quaint tourist getaway 
than an urban wasteland destroyed by the drug trade 
of the 80s and 90s. Still, the bands lyrics lay bare the 
corruption and danger of their supposedly pristine home 
town. Hell Hath No Fury, Clipses newest album, is a 
complex, lyrically nimble work that takes pride in the 
struggle of inner-city life, as well as raging against its 
injustices.
