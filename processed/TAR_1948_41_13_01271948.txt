Council Howls Down 
GI Style9 of Serving
Members Object To Plan For Skibo
Despite Possible Drop In Prices
G I style food servings at Skibo, along with other suggestions 
to afford greater economies in the school cafeteria, brought the 
Student Council meeting of January 21 to an uproar. Vehement 
pros and con raged around the head of Jerome Bell concerning 
the system suggested by his special committeeserving food directly 
on dishes, receptable-type trays in order to initiate certain econo
mies.
Also under discussion at the^ 
meeting in Council chambers was 
a recommendation to revise the 
present method of voting in Stu
dent Council elections.
Other important matters were 
a motion to obligate the Tartan 
to print Student Council minutes 
verbatim and an earnest request 
by Representative Jack Johnson 
that Student Council resume the 
budgetary control which it held 
previous to the war.
Student Council representative 
Marvin Gustavson, speaking as 
if he echoed the sentiments of the 
majority of the campus, declared 
that, I dont like the idea of any 
GI style food. He was supported 
by Miss Sema Moskovitz who, ap
parently alarmed at the whole 
idea, observed that Things will 
be all slopped together.
Representative Bell concluded 
his committee report by announc
ing that, since prices were lower 
in general at Duquesne University 
the management of Skibo intends 
to make a survey of conditions 
there. Further discussion was 
withheld pending completion of 
the survey.
Gustavson, who leads the com
mittee authorized to submit rec
ommendations for a method of se
lecting class officers, declared that 
the choice of class representatives 
did not warrant petitions and a 
school election. Their system, proposirig the appointment of two 
of three Student Council nom
inated candidates, was questioned 
by Miss Moskovitz as to fairness. 
Jack Ewart commented that it 
would be advisable to nqtify the 
students of future nominations.
Emphasizing the fact that lim
ited Tartan space and budget do 
not allow verbatim printing of 
Student Council minutes, Rep. 
Gustavson clashed with Jerome 
Bell, who is currently making a 
determined .stand to see that all 
material deemed official for pub
lication by the Student Council

Petitions
Inasmuch as there is an 
abundance of time prior to the March 11 Student Council elec
tion, the due date for petitions 
for Council offices has been ad
vanced from January 30 to 
February 6. There are a total of 
12 positions open in the College 
of Engineering, four in Fine 
Arts, and three in MMCC. The 
Fine Arts and MMCC candi
dates must be now rated as 
lower Juniors. Every candidate 
for one of these positions must 
file a petition whether or not 
he submitted one for the pre
vious election.

Announcing their entry in the new Student Council race to 
see if an actively backed group of independents can gain repre
sentation on a fraternity controlled Council, John Anderson, William 
Johns, and J. K. OHare have filed their petitions as candidates for 
the March 11 election.
Backed by the I-prime-A-C, a newly formed independent group 
calling themselves the Independent Action Committee,* these men

With the renowned scientist Dr.

p.m. on February 22 in the Car
negie Music hall will see 200 grad

Margaret Morrison receiving their 
diplomas.
At the same time Dr. Robert 
Franklin Mehl, head of the de

research laboratory will make the 
presentation of honorary degrees.
Music for the program will be 
furnished by the Mens Glee club 
and by Charles A. H. Pearson, 
M.A. 22, organist.
Left to right, candidates J.' K. OHare, William Johns, John 
Anderson, and IAC chairman Robert Crago.
are the leaders of the fight which succeeded in having the results of 
the December 18 election declared void.
Claiming that the results of this election were no indication 
of actual independent interest in the campus, Robert Crago, chair
man of IAC, gave the two chief points which his organization will 
stress during the rapidly developing election campaign.
Fraternity control of Council and many activities on campus,
?said Crago, is a stifling influence 
on the progress of the entire stu
dent body.
When asked to define prog
ress, Crago replied after a mo
ments thought: It would be the 
elimination of friction between op
posing factions.
The second point which he em
phasized was the need for voting 
only for candidates whom you feel 
should be on Council.
You are not required, he 
pointed out repeatedly, to vote 
every position open in Council. 
You can, for example, vote foi 
only three men, turn your ballo' 
in, and it will be just as valid ar 
if you had completed the ballot bj 
voting for strangers.
We hope, Crago concluded 
"that the drastic action taken bj 
this, group in having the results 
of the December election voided 
will bring home to independents 
the necessity for active participa
tion in campus politics to prevenl 
a repetition of complete fraternity 
domination of Student Council.
Registration 
Planned For 
Feb. 23.24
Registration will be held in the 
gymnasium on February 23 and 
24 beginning at 9:00 a. m. on 
both days.
There will be no divisions with 
respect to departments or posi 
tion of names in the alphabet, 
with the only two restrictions 
which have been set up both con
cerning Margaret Morrison fresh
men and sophomores.
MMCC freshmen will register 
on Tuesday, February 24, and 
Margaret Morrison sophomores 
must report to the stage in This
tle hall to have their pictures 
taken before they are issued their 
permits to register.
With 3600 students registering 
in two days, preliminary action 
has been taken to provide some 
relief from the congestion by the 
use of pre-scheduling in several 
departments.
All of the candidates tfor 
Balinesian Queen will be pre
sented at the Bali Rally, which 
will be held on Monday after
noon, February 2, at 4:30 in 
the Little Theatre of Fine 
Arts.
The Rally will also serve 
to present several talented 
students in Balinesian dances. 
Students with other talents will 
present a Balinesian fashion show.
The election for Balinesian 
Queen will take place three days 
later, on February 5, from 11:30 
to 1:30 in the main hall of Fine 
Arts. Names of the girls nomi
nated for Queen will be grouped 
on the ballot according to depart
ment, and each Arts student will 
vote for one girl from each de
partment.
After photographs of the ten 
finalists (the two highest vote-getters in each department) have been sent to New York for final 
judging and the determination of 
ing Queen, the name of the winner will be kept secret until Feb
ruary 27, when it will be an
nounced at the ball.
Price of a ticket to the ball has 
risen to $3.25 per person, the ad
ditional twenty-five cents going 
to the new Pittsburgh city tax. 
However, the price is still below 
that for the 1946 ball.
The tickets, available only to 
Arts students upon presentation of 
their registration cards, will be 
placed on sale today at 4:30 in the 
departmental offices in Fine Arts.
Although there are 800 Fine Arts 
students, only 500 tickets are be
ing sold, the restriction being ne
cessitated by the limited capacity 
of the foyer and exhibition room. 
Each student will therefore be al
lowed only one ticket, with the 
exception of married students, 
who may purchase another.

Editorial
About YOUR Story
The recent misunderstanding between the 
Tartan and Student Council concerning the 
proper presentation of the latters affairs to 
the student body is the precipitating cause for
this editorial.
Through the good offices of Mr. Negley 
Reed, Chairman of the Publications commit
tee and Councilman Marvin Gustavson the 
difficulty is now being removed. They have de
vised a method which will enable Student 
Council to speak directly to the student body 
as the need arises, and which will still lea\ e 
the Tartans badly cramped news-space sub
stantially undiminished.
But the basic problem behind this expla
nation of our difficulties, the lack of space 
resulting from the inadequacy of available 
financial resources, is unsolvable for the pres
ent.
The reasoning behind the consequent (and 
of late, rather frequent) deletions must 
therefore be made clear if further difficulties 
such as those just experienced with Student 
Council are to be avoided.
If all news stories which do not give no
tice of a coming meeting, assembly, rehearsal, 
or similar event were to be deleted, and if the 
various columns and feature stories were to 
be similarly dropped, then there would prob
ably be just about enough room for each lit
tle announcement which is submitted to us 
for publication.
But as we have explained before, a good 
newspaper is something morethan a bulletin 
board, having functions of entertainment, en
lightenment, and expression of opinion to per
form And overall reaction to the Tartans 
attempt to perform these supplementary but 
still important duties has been good so far.
Thus, as the make up of the paper nears 
completion, each of the remaining stories (of 
which there are invariably an excess) must be 
evaluated against all of the others and against 
the criterion; is this story absolutely necessary 
to the activity involved?
Err ora have, inevitably been made in this 
evalution, and more w'ill undoubtedly be com
mitted in the future. But if you, as the head 
of an activity, believe that your organization 
has consistently failed to receive proper no
tice and has suffered from this lack, then you 
have the Editors personal invitation to call 
him at EM 7556 any night, Monday through 
Thursday, and speak your piece.'
Letters to the Editor
NSA Boosted
Editor, the Tartan:
Its about time .that the student body found 
out what the NSA is. I say this because there has 
been a great deal of tactless discussion on campus 
recently concerning this topic.
The NSA was launched on the University of 
Wisconsin campus, now the permanent NSA head
quarters, in September of last year to give the 
American college student representation in the edu
cational world.
A few of its aims are to foster better educa
tional standards, methods and facilities and work 
for the improvement of student social, cultural 
and physical welfare. These aims will be pursued 
thru information exchanges, student tours and 
student discussion of educational improvements.
The program strives to teach students more 
about the world at large and how to work to
gether with people who do not necessarily share 
their ideologies and political philosophies. Among 
the four hundred names of the various colleges 
and universities found on the NSA roster are those 
of MIT, Harvard, Smith, Wisconsin, University of 
Chicago, Williams, Mount Holyoke, Notre Dame 
and Wellesley. * -
Carnegie Tech should be a member of this or
ganization which includes so many other colleges 
of high reputation. It should hardly be necessary 
to convince Student Council of this fact. Tech must 
take its place, along with MIT and Notre Dame, 
in the effort to see to it that students receive the 
benefits of a highly technical, yet social, education.
Sincerely,
GERALD C. MEYERS.
Why Keys?
Editor, the Tartan:
At the January 7 meeting of Student Council 
Jack Seward expressed his opinion that key 
awards should be discontinued. I agreehe is
right.
Students ostensibly attend college to acquire 
an education. Part of this education consists of 
participation in the extra-curricular activities 
which augment the academic program. This fact 
should be met squarely. Now, does it seem reas
onable that students voluntarily participating in 
activities for their own enjoyment and enlighten
ment will covet memos for their key chains?* 
To me it is incongruousthe pleasure and educa
tion derived should suffice as reward.
I believe that at the moment some students 
are prone to place the key first and the activity 
second. This is rather a distorted sense of propor
tion. If key awards were discontinued it might

Right Face!

44Secure All Stations!
Perhaps Im being unnecessarily premature but 
do you realize that it is almost book-store time 
again? You know what I meanregistration day. 
In my mind registration day has always been 
just one long line, culminating in that CIT classic 
the book-store line.
During the past two semesters, book-store per
sonnel have done much to decrease congestion and 
keep an orderly line moving past the counter. 
However, the problem, is still with us because of 
the large student body. With the limited facili
ties it is impossible to keep the line-spongers 
and the place-savers from causing confusion. 
I think that this problem can be overcome if we 
start planning now a new method of attack.
The greatest hindrance to efficiency in issuing 
books and supplies seems to be the limited coun
ter space. No matter how much extra help is add
ed in the present location, only four or five peo
ple can be served at a time. An obvious improve
ment would therefore seem to be a way of hand
ling more people at a timein short, additional 
counter space.
This could first be accomplished by establish
ing two or three temporary book-stores during 
registration week and the first few days of school. 
Each of these locations should specialize in a lim
ited number of text books. As the students pass 
through the registration line they would be sup
plied with a mimeographed list of course num
bers, accompanying texts, and the location of the 
branch store carrying these texts.
If three extra counters could be set up, the 
main book store could specialize in lab and art 
supplies. In the past, the sale of supplies has done

Letters To The EditorOh No, E. D.!
Editor, the Tartan:
The first thing that caught my 
eye in this weeks Tartan was the 
headline which informed the stu
dents of an expected increase in 
tuition. Near the bottom of this 
column was a statement made by 
our Provost to the senior engi
neers which informed these men 
of the coming of 40 to 50 page 
term papers in their last year 
courses in social relations.
I am fully aware that it is the 
Provosts business and right to 
determine what changes have to 
be made in the Social Relations 
program, and that the need for 
such changes certainly exists. 
However, I believe that the bur
dening of men with term papers 
which approach thesis length in 
courses that are little related to 
their expected life work is a waste 
of time, of which these men have 
not too much to spare.
If the Provost will observe the 
schedules of the senior class, he 
will notice that in many depart
ments the hours in class alone fill 
up each day, with the exception 
of perhaps one afternoon. A thesis 
or term paper of the length pre
scribed by the Provost would 
force the student to divert much 
of the time he has spent in his 
technical courses to endless and 
almost useless hours in the li
brary with a history or economics 
text.
Another thing the Provost 
should consider is that the engi
neering student learns little 
about his particular branch of 
the profession until his senior 
year, and that it is important that 
he have the time to acquaint him
self fully with the courses in his 
department.
I also noticed that the students 
present when the Provost made
this remark had no reply or ex
pressed no opinions. These gen
tlemen are supposed to represent 
the student body, and I feel that 
knowing the attitude of the ma
jority of the students with regard 
to term papers they should have 
informed the Provost of this at
titude.

Editor, The Tartan
Before an intelligent decision 
can be made concerning the Na
tional Student Association the stu
dent body should be acquainted 
with the purposes and proposed 
constitution of the organization.
What does NSA provide for in 
its suggested program of activi
ties? First and foremost: Student 
welfare. It proposes that there be 
four separate national commis
sions working to collect and dis
tribute information on student 
needs and problems, and that sep
arate commissions be established 
in each region and on each cam
pus corresponding to the nation
al commissions.
The first commission will deal 
with academic and cultural prob
lems. Its purpose is to prepare 
information at the regional level 
showing the academic advantages 
and disadvantages of various col
leges and universities which can 
then be distributed to high school 
students to assist them in select
ing their colleges.
On the cultural level this com
mission wants to sponsor inter
campus activities such as student 
art and architecture exhibits, and 
musical and dramatic programs.
The second commission, which 
will deal with student govern
ment, is going to attack the prob
lems of student apathy and the

Josephine Campbell Named 
Assistant Dean Of Women
Former National Secretary Of Girls Group 
Replaces Dean Yon For 1948 Fall Semester
Miss Josephine Campbell, for
mer National FJ Id Secretary of 
Camp Fire Girls, Inc., will become 
assistant dean of women at CIT, 
effective March 1. Miss Campbell 
will become dean of women in the 
fall of 1948, succeeding Mrs. Jes
sie Yon who will retire at that 
time.
Miss Campbell was admissions 
and field secretary for eight years 
at the Pennsylvania College for Women, and served as naval pro
curement officer, personnel offic
er, ind womens reserve represen
tative in Pittsburgh and New 
York City during the war. A grad
uate of Irving and Simmons col
leges, she has also studied in the 
Columbia University School of 
Business.
In a letter to Dr. Douglas F. 
Miner, director of student per
sonnel and welfare, during a prelininary correspondence, Miss 
Campbell stated, Your institu 
tion, the curricula offered, and the 
type of students enrolled have 
always interested me, and I be
lieve I would enjoy assisting to 
maintain the high standards that 
have become synonymous with the 
name of the institution.
The ten years I spent in Pitts 
burgh afforded me rich oppor 
tunity. to become familiar with 
the schools and colleges in the 
tri-state area and to become ac
quainted with the deans of women 
and the presidents of the colleges 
I believe those contacts plus my first-hand information about the 
cities and towns from which the 
majority of the students come 
would be helpful back-ground to 
me if I were to be dean of the in
stitute.

Prof. Kimberly 
Dies After 
Severe Illness
Professor George Byron Kim
berly, assistant professor in the 
department of drama, died in the 
Columbia Hospital, Wilkinsburg, 
on Thursday, January 22, after an 
illness of seven weeks.
Known affectionately to col
leagues and students as Kim, the 
professor was at CIT since 1927. 
After several years as a student, 
he became a member of the fac
ulty with the position of instruct
or. When he died at the age of 
46, he was in charge of stage light
ing and technical practices and 
was considered an expert in his 
field.Before coming to Carnegie, Prof. 
Kimberly attended the University 
of Michigan and Ohio State uni
versity. He also had five years of 
field experience with the General 
Electric Standardizing laborat
ories.In 1940 Professor Kimberly 
married Elizabeth Schrader, also 
an assistant professor in drama 
and a 1928 graduate of the de
partment. The Kimberlys have 
been noted for the warmth of 
their home which they generously 
extended to the students.
The criticism of one of our 
WCIT shows which appeared in 
the Tartan last week was proba
bly justified by the facts, Ivan 
Faigen, station manager-elect, 
said last week.
But, he continued, it is not 
fair for Mr. Charpic to draw 
from the one incident the conclu
sion that none of our shows are 
of acceptable quality. In this he 
was heartily seconded by Eph 
Abramson, retiring station man
ager, and Bob Coddington, chief 
announcer, both of whom were 
also aroused by what they consid
ered to be an unjust accusation.
Although none of us heard that 
particular show, declared 
Abramson, we know that some
times such a program does get 
broadcast. Those of us responsi
ble for the station cannot hear 
every program that goes on the 
air, but whenever something is 
wrong we want to hear about it. 
When questioned about the 
statement made by Robert Charpie 
in his Tartan column, Right Face, 
that WCIT is inferior to other col
lege stations, Coddington thought 
that the unfavorable comparison 
of WCIT to other college stations 
results from failing to take some 
very important factors into con
sideration.
Our station, he continued, is 
an extra-curricular activity, to 
which very few people can devote 
a large amount of time. There are 
only about ten other college sta
tions in the nation on a similar 
basis, and although we are only 
in^ our second year of operation 
we feel that our program quality 
is good compared to theirs.
We could expect, Coddington 
explained, that WCIT would suf
fer when it is compared to the 
stations which are operated as an 
integral part of the undergraduate 
curriculum. He added that at 
such schools the members of the 
staff spend a large part of their 
time working on the station and 
receive credits as for any other 
course for the work they do. On 
the other hand, he concluded, 
all of WCITs workers are great
ly restricted by lack of time. 
That is only one of our prob
lems, put in Faigen. The big 
one right now is to improve and 
expand the technical facilities of 
the station. Until this one is licked 
we cant devote our full attention 
to programming, and as a result, 
that phase of the stations opera
tion suffers.
We havent been ignoring it, 
Abramson added. But because 
good, live programs are so hard 
to produce we must rely primar
ily on record programs. When we 
do get a good live program, com
pletely produced and performed 
by some group outside the station, 
we are very glad to put it on 
the air.
Our aim, declared Faigen, is 
to give the best possible radio 
service to this campus. We wel
come suggestions for improving 
our service and we sincerely in
vite anyone to let us know what 
they think is wrong with the sta
tion.

Cregut Farewell Sees 
Rosier Future Ahead\
It is with many regrets that I 
start this column which will be 
the last to appear under my name 
in the Tartan. I have considered it 
quite an honor to have the opportunity to express my own 
opinions each 
week to any andt  ^ s - 
all who cared to ^Ife*. read them. And 
now that it is^Ef|*  ^1
all over, I just lllS'
column has accomplished half;
as much inporting and improving athletics! |
at Carnegie as I H
hoped it would
when I started pete Cregutit over a year
ago.
The job of reporting the sport 
news to the student body during 
this past year has been a hard 
one. During this period we have 
not had one intercollegiate team 
that could boast of a winning sea
son, so it had to be a matter of 
taking solace in the little crumbs 
of victory that were scattered here 
and there along the way and 
blowing them up into stories far 
bigger than their importance. It 
also meant keeping a note of op
timism imbedded in the stories 
somewhere to bolster what little 
school spirit there was left.
Whether or not this attempt at 
focusing attention on a slightly 
rosier future has had the desired 
effect on the student body is not 
for me to judge, but I must ad
mit that it has had its effect on 
me. As I have stated before, and 
will gladly state again, there is 
little doubt in my mind that inter
collegiate athletics at Carnegie 
Tech are in for better times. And 
I dont say this because of the 
fact that they couldnt get much 
worse either. Anybody who
watched the 1946 and 1947 foot
ball teams cant deny that there 
was a tremendous improvement 
between those two teams and the 
most encouraging fact was that 
many of the fellows who brought 
about the improvement were 
freshman who have three more 
years to get the Tartans back into 
winning ways. It seems to point 
to the fact that my successors will 
have at least one less problem to 
worry about.
At this point I would like to 
tell you a little something about 
the man who will take over this 
job, Bill Schnitgen. Bill is prob
ably best known to you by two 
names other than those with 
which he was born. They are 
Bucky, and more affectionately 
and more appropriately, Barrel. 
You can easily recognize him as 
he is the shortest and roundest 
thing that walks on this campus.
Buckys qualifications are cer
tainly varied. In addition to be
ing the sports editor of both his 
high school and junior high 
school newspapers he played 
varsity football and basketball in 
high school as well as doing a 
stint as reserve guard on the Car
negie football team in 1946. An 
example of Buckys writing abili
ties can be seen in any of the 
feature articles done on the footEd Schwendner, bowling 
high-scorer, lets one go.
ball and basketball players in the 
Tartan during the past semester. 
I think that as soon as Bill has 
had an opportunity to illustrate 
what he can do, you will all agree 
with me that he is well quali
fied for the job.
In closing I would like to ex
tend my thanks to Bob Johnson 
for the work that he has done in 
making these columns of mine 
readable. Im sure it was a moun
tainous task. I would also like to 
thank Shirley Seiner and Harry 
Silverman for the help they gave 
me in the makeup of the sports 
pages. Without their help, it 
would have been a hopeless job.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1948THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
St. Vincent Snowed 
By Tartan Barrage
Coming through with a second half scoring barrage, Carnegie 
Tech snowed the St. Vincent Bearcats 56-43 before 1000 specta
tors in the gym last Saturday night. After being held to 21 points 
in the first half, the Tartans poured 35 points through the hoop in 
the final 20 minutes.
The visitors aggressiveness in the first half prevented the Plaid 
from getting close to the basket while the crowd was being treated 
to some fancy dribbling and pass-#------------------------------------------------
ing by Don Kelly, diminutive 
Bearcat guard. It was the same 
Kelly who sent St. Vincent out in 
front 11-10 at quarter time with 
a spectacular hook shot from the 
corner.
The second quarter started with 
a tipped-in rebound shot by Ellies 
to put Carnegie in front. St. Vin
cent retook the lead on a pivot 
by Hazlett and a foul line con
version by D. Kelly before Ellies 
and Theodore came through with 
two quick buckets to send the Skibos ahead 16-14.
With McCullugh and Theodore 
leading the way, the Tartans built 
up a 10 point advantage in the 
third quarter. Closer checking by 
Carnegie prevented the Bearcats 
from working their fast opening 
plays which proved fairly success
ful in the first half.
Ellies and Hazlett put on their 
own scoring show in the opening
minutes of the last quarter. Each 
bagged seven points to make the 
scoreboard read 47-37 with six 
minutes remaining in the game. A 
couple of layup shots by Bianchi 
and Chetlin together with a pair 
of free throws iced the game for 
the Tartans with less than two 
minutes to go.
Theodore was high for Carnegie 
with 15 points, closely followed by 
r McCullugh with 14 and Ellies 
who contributed 13.

Delt Cagers 
Defeat Betas 
In 36-34 Upset
Pulling the biggest upset of the 
young season, the Delts last week 
edged out the Betas by a 36-34 
count in a thrilling contest. Trail
ing by 7 points as the first quarter 
ended, the Delts finally found the 
range and gradually pulled away 
to a two-point advantage at halftime. Their lead, extended at one 
time to five points enabled them 
in the final moments to withstand 
a desperate Beta drive.
The Sigma Nu-Phi Kap strug
gle set a new high in close games. 
The final whistle sounded with 
the score knotted at 22 all. Dur
ing a five-minute overtime the 
lead changed hands several times 
before the period ended with Sig
ma Nu on top of the 27-28 score.
The dead eye SAEs still held 
a charm over the hoops as they 
poured through 54 points against 
the 49ers who could muster only 
30. Jewell had 20 points while 
Watson garnered 19 to top the 
winners scoring list. The Kappa 
Sigs rebounded to plaster the Citcom cagers with a 38-31 score.
Tartans Bow To Thiel 
In Last-Minute Upset
Bowing to Thiel 53-49, the hot and cold Tartans blew another 
sure victory as they fell apart in the final two minutes of a game 
played on the Tomcats court January 21.
The win, following the Skibos weird demonstration of how to 
lose a ball game with less than two minutes remaining after hold
ing a six-point lead, was the Blue and Golds first success of the 
--------------year.Wild continued his scoring spree 
as he collected 12 points more.
The DUs returned to winning 
ways by trouncing FPHA 57-32 as 
Koch and McKee accounted for 16 
and 14 pounts respectively. The 
TXs found the Dorm a little 
tougher than Sigma Nu but were 
able to win their second game by 
a 23-15 count.
Other games in the Set Shot 
league showed the PiKAs out
playing the ATOs in a game in 
which the PiKAs Hawley led the 
team to a 32-19 win as he scored 
15 points. The 3As laced the Kappa Sig Bs 40-14, and Emanon 
trounced Sigma Nu Bs 48-19 to 
end the Weeks play.
Long Shot League results gave 
the Betas a 35-30 victory over the 
Beta Sigs as Clay copped 13 points 
for the winners. The Tau Delts 
30-13 triumph over TX returned 
them to winning ways. The AAA 
mustered their second win by 
cutting down the 7 Aces 45-20.

After fighting neck and neck for 
the first period, Ellies put the 
Skibos in front, 1513, on a jumppivot shot with six minutes re
maining in the half. The Tomcats 
were held to a single field goal as 
Theodore converted on a pair of 
one-handers from the side and 
Chetlin made good on a shot from 
the foul circle to put Carnegie in 
front 21-17 at halftime.
Riehls one-hander following 
quick points by Theodore pushed 
Carnegie up to a 26-17 lead be
fore Thiel came to life with seven 
straight points. Both teams fought 
on even terms until Ellies and 
Bianchi came through with two 
points to bring the Plaids lead to 
35-30 as the teams headed into the 
final ten minutes.
Thiel fought back with two 
breakaway scores, but again 
Coach Donohues charges regained 
a five-point lead on a pivot by 
Theodore and a brace of free 
throws. A layup and set shot by 
Bolivar brought Thiel within two

spurted to an eight-point lead on 
baskets by Riehl, Theodore and 
Ellies. With only three minutes 
remaining, the Tomcats refused to 
concede defeat as they reduced 
their deficit to six points.
The scoreboard read 49-43 and 
the clock showed 1:45 to go when 
the roof fell in on Coach Dono

were intercepted and converted in

Gustavson supported his opin

dull and not too informative. 
He went on to say that as long 
as the Tartan exposition is rea

editing the minutes should be ac

A motion made by J. K. OHare, 
proposed to amend Student Coun

the check-off system of voting 
and thereby allow students to vote 
at any authorized campus polling

agreed that this action by APO 
was a step in the direction of 
better and more efficient elec

As the meeting progressed, Jack

Council stop permitting itself to 
be a figurehead in budgeting 
and allot remuneration for cer
tain time-consuming extra-curric

formed Johnson that he, Seward, 
had tried such a move before and 
had been stopped hard by the 
administration.
This discussion terminated when 
Andrew Sterrett presented an ac
tivities scholarship program. It 
provided for the subsidization of 
fourteen campus activities, includ

discussion is expected at the next

We want to make clear that*-----------------------------------------------
when an R grade is given as a 
semester grade, the student must 
repeat the entire course in order 
to obtain credit.
The conditional grades, with 
new changes, will be as follows:

If you receive an I grade, it 
will indicate that your work is in
complete, although otherwise pass

given if your instructor and the 
head of that particular depart
ment are of the opinion that it 
was outside your control to com
plete the course in full.
An X grade will only be given 
at the end of a semester and only 
in an exceptional case. You will 
be given an opportunity to bring 
your work up to a passing level 
without repeating the course. The 
college or division and the depart
ment concerned with the instruc
tion will determine the conditions 
for you to make up an X or I 
grade. If you do not take steps to 
rectify a conditional grade by the 
end of the next academic year, 
and you are still in attendance at 
school, your mark will automat
ically become an R.
Once given a permanent grade, 
you cannot take a re-examination 
to try to raise the work.

Cleeton Announces 
Tuition Increase
Something new is to be added next September when you come 
back to school. Yes, another hike in tuition rates is scheduled to 
go into effect. This was the gist of the news tendered a few of the 
Council Members by Director Cleeton on January 20. Apparently 
the costs of running the school have increased to such a point 
that it has become necessary to ask the Carnegie Trustees to ap
prove this increase.
