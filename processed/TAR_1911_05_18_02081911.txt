PLEBE BANQUET
First Year Men of the Schools of Applied Science and Design Hold Annual Feed with
' Great Success.
TimeMonday evening, February Sixth. Place 
Monongahela House. EventAnnual Plebe Ban
quet. That tells the story in a nutshell. However, 
it does not tell of the rare good fellowship and genu
ine class spirit which made the affair one of the 
most pleasant events of the current school year. 
From the moment Toastmaster Johns seated him
self at the head of the brilliantly lighted cluster of 
tables until the last strains of the Alma Mater 
slowly died away into the midnight air, festivity 
reigned. Fun and laughter filled the banquet hall 
as course after course of the elegantly appointed 
dinner was brought in and disposed of. An under
current of serious good feeling ran through the as
sembly, a pleasing balance to the livelier spirits of 
the crowd.
Nearly fifty Plebes were in attendance, every one 
a good fellow. As the evening advanced, hearts 
grew lighter and spirits more mellow, and when 
the last sip of coffee proclaimed the time for mental 
recreation, every man leaned back in his chair, cigar 
or cigarette in hand, prepared to enjoy the offerings 
of the speakers. And very enjoyable the toasts 
proved.
The honor guests of the evening were Deans Leete 
and Hornbostel, of the two Schools, Science and 
Design. Mr. Leete responded to the call with a 
speech, pleasing in its earnestness, delightful in its 
natural humor, and withal forcible. Mr. Hornbostels fund of witticisms and anecdotes, surcharged 
with an inimitable semi-seriousness, prove a source
of true enjoyment to the listeners. The mock riv
alry of the two Deans regarding the merits of their 
respective Schools, found ready understanding in 
the minds of the students, who seemed to appreciate 
a humorous situation to its utmost.
H. J. McCorkle, president of the Senior class of 
the School of Applied Science, delivered a heart-toheart talk on the subject of School Spirit and Our 
Track Team. The subject of track athletics is a 
hobby of Manager Macs, and every man present 
was impressed with the earnestness with which he 
spoke.
James K. Lamoree, Editor of the Tartan, re
sponded to a toast without a name, with a speech 
without a point, enjoyably short and quickly de
livered.
Howard R. Anerswald, the next speaker called, 
gave a well-rendered address, which showed much 
preparation and a clever command of language. He 
spoke on School Athletics.
In a short speech, Mr. F. H. Haaren then spoke for 
the School of Applied Design, and in a simple, 
straightforward manner expressed the interest and 
good wishes of the Design men. Grover C. Smith 
was then called by President Johns, and in answer 
to the toast, Higher Education for Girls, presented 
an array of intimate knowledge of feminity, which 
drew plaudits of laughter and admiration from his 
fellow-classmates.
One of the most unique speeches of the evening 
was next offered by E. H. Grotefend, the long, lean,

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
lanky, Lawrencevillain. Dutchs ten-word sketches 
of well-known members of The Faculty were 
clean-cut, clever and original. Mr. Grotefend's 
speech was enhanced by a display of mythological 
lore and classical innuendos seldom approached in 
these Schools.
The last speaker of the evening, Mr. Louis R. 
Madison, delivered a short and really good talk on 
The Future of the Plebe Class. His words were 
convincing and earnest and went straight to the 
hearts of his listeners.
Throughout the evening, Class Cheer-leader Alcott McKusick lead the class in a series of spirited 
yells. Macs work was quick, decisive and right to 
the minute.
At the close the Alma Mater was sung by the loyal 
sons, the sweet echoes clinging to the walls of the 
banquet-hall long after the final note was thrown 
upon the air.
President Johns presided during the evening with 
the ease and grace of an experienced toastmaster, 
and he and his committee, F. W. Roessner, E. P. 
Love, A. M. McKusick, R. W. Lewis, J. E. Richard
son, W. L. Daugherty and H. E. Gaenser, deserve 
great credit for the able manner in which the even
ings program was carried out. Not a single slow 
moment marred the merriment of the mellow mo
ments. Although the President of the Sophomore 
Class failed to appear according to certain plans 
laid, the best wishes of the assembled guests were 
his.
The Plebe Class is to be congratulated upon the 
true class spirit and love of Carnegie Tech which 
prompts occasions such as this annual banquet. 
Good fellowship and loyalty are the best part of our 
lives and college days are dearer by their presence.
BASKET BALL TRIP.
During inspection week, the basket ball team took 
a trip through Ohio, playing all of the strongest 
teams in that section. Only two out of six games 
were won, this fact being largely due to the absence 
of Captain Williams and DuBarry, and to the un
familiar floors. The trip, however, gave the men 
confidence in themselves, and with the addition of 
the two men before named, it is expected that they 
will beat Pitt on Friday.
Marietta, O., Jan. 27, 1911.
The team was very tired from their long train ride 
when they entered the hall. This largely accounts 
for their lack of dash during the second half. The 
hall was above the usual size, and was in addition 
dimly lighted. The play during the first half was 
fairly even, the score being 1510 in Mariettas 
favor when the whistle blew. Kilgore starred in 
this half with three field goals.
In the second half, Marietta began to draw away. 
Mulinex scored six goals from the field during this 
half, while the whole Tech team could only locate
the basket three times. The shooting of Mulinex 
was the feature of the game, while Kilgore and Met
calf also starred. Score:

Denison, Jan. 28, 1911.
The team went directly to the hall from the train, 
after a hard five-hour trip. The floor was very 
slippery and over 100 feet in length. This was all 
very new to our players, and contributed greatly to 
their defeat. But the main cause, however, was the 
playing of Black. This forward is a 190-pound six 
footer, with an average of eleven field goals in all 
games played up to the present time. He, alone, 
scored 22 points for his team. The work of Ruggs
also featured. Score:

Athens, O., Jan. 30, 1911.
After resting in Columbus over Sunday, the team 
regained its usual form and won from Ohio Univer
sity 2823. The game was fast throughout, the 
score at the end of the first half being 119. Mandeville starred during this period with 4 pretty field 
goals. In the next half, Tech pulled away gradually, 
scoring 7 field goals to their opponents 5. Mandeville also led with 3 goals in this half, making 7 in 
all. Jordan and R. Williams also played well,

THE TARTAN5
Cedarville, O., Jan. 31, 1911.
The game with Ohio University had given the 
team confidence in their own ability, and they went 
to Cedarville with greater confidence. Cedarville 
College had not been beaten upon their own floor for 
three years, but Tech broke their proud record when 
they won 2819. Cedarville had a fast, heavy team 
which guarded very closely. They held frequently, 
but the referee was very lenient, and few fouls were 
eallea.
Keltz starred during the first half, getting 2 field 
goals and 2 fouls. Kilgore and Jordan also scored. 
For Cedarville, Clemens and Dickerson scored twice 
each. The score at the end of the half was 1310 
in Cedarvilles favor.
After the intermission, Tech started to gain, and, 
with 4 minutes to play, Cedarville led, 1918. Then 
Tech showed the prettiest work of the season. On 
quick passes, Jordan got the ball under the basket 
and put Tech in the lead by one point. Shortly after 
this, Saunders caged a shot from near the center of 
the floor, after taking the ball out of a scrimmage. 
Cedarville then fouled, but, as Keltz missed, Wil
liams jumped into the air and batted the ball 
through the ring. Keltz then got a short basket, 
after which he pulled off the feature shot of the 
evening. This was a one-handed, overhead shot 
from the corner of the cage. The whistle then blew, 
giving the game to Tech by a score of 2823, after 
scoring 10 points in 4 minutes. Score:
Tech28. Cedarville19

At Mt. Union, the team played a sleepy game dur
ing the first half, with the result that the score was 
186 against them at the end of the period. After 
the intermission, the team woke up and outscored 
their opponents by 2 points. During this game, Jor
dan starred for Tech with five field goals, while 
Gibson and Sager performed well for Mt. Union.

the season. Tech never had a chance, the first half

Most of the drawings were of unusual merit and the 
judgment was made after quite a long deliberation. 
The Tartan wishes to thank its many friends for the 
interest and help they have shown.

6THE TARTAN
PADDY RYAN IS DEAD.
The following notice appeared in an Akron, Ohio, 
paper recently:
Patrick Ryan, proprietor of Ryans Place, the 
name he had bestowred on a hotel he has managed 
for the past 25 years, and located on the Big Reser
voir, died at his home there Sunday night of Brights 
disease. He had been sick for over six months and 
unable to conduct the hotel for a longer time. He 
had tried various cures and visited many resorts in 
his efforts to find a cure, but all in vain. Ryan was 
a familiar character in the Portake Lake region.
Ryans Place, the business that Ryan had con
ducted for so many years, is a hostelry made famous 
all over this section. Hardly a person but has at 
one time or another in trips to the lakes seen or 
visited this place. At one time Ryan owned a launch 
with the name of his wife painted on the hull, and 
which he ran up and down the lakes filled with pas
sengers. He was 55 years of age and is survived 
by a wife, Mary Ryan, and two sons, Perry and 
Frank Ryan, both living at home. One son died 
about six months ago. Mr. Ryan made a specialty 
of fish dinners and his feeds of this character num
bered into the thousands every year. Many stories, 
too, are connected with his hotel, which was the 
oldest on the lakes.
Those in these schools who have heard of the de
ceased and have learned to hold him in kindly rec
ollection, will regretfully read the above notice.
It will be remembered that Professor Doyle, in his 
lectures to the Plebe classes on politics, made fre
quent reference to the name of Paddy Ryan while 
illustrating the ins and outs of the political game.
We gathered sufficient from these references to 
form the conclusion that Paddy had a wonderful 
personality.
Paddy, it appears, had a likeable personality; a 
personality which won him considerable influence.
He was a fast friei:d, and to be a friend of his 
meant a great deal to the aspirant to political office, 
because Paddy had a nack of controlling the votes 
in his particular section.
Even to be a friend of a friend of Paddys counted 
some.
If you were after a political office and wanted the 
support of Paddys particular section, all that was 
necessary was to see Paddy and to tell him that 
you were a friend of Judge So and So, a friend of his, 
you would be received with open arms and the de
sired support given generously.
Limited space precludes a recital of some of the 
incidents touching upon the career of Paddy, so 
much will be left to the memory of those who were 
fortunate enough to have heard them recounted.
While amusing in some respects, they portray a 
refreshing personality of a kind, which in this pres
ent uay struggle for existence, where ones life is 
inclined to be more or less self-centered, is perhaps 
rarely found.
JUNIOR PROMENADE.
The committee will be glad to hear from those 
clubs wishing an assignment of space in the dance

THE TARTAN7
WHISKERS
Allegheny College students get out unique journal.
WHISKERS, A NECESSITY 
Who! When! Why! Where! How!
No great movement of reform has been without its 
mouthpiece. When Luther formulated the doctrines 
which rocked the theological world on its foundations 
he drew up his theses and nailed them to the door 
of the University. When William Randolph Hearst 
began his systematic attempt to rule the United 
States he voiced his sentiments in an organ of the 
press. So now, the men who are in forefront of all 
college activities, feel that, like their immortal pro
genitors, the reformers of earlier days, they must 
give to the world at large their doctrines in perma
nent, and if possible, attractive form.
Hence, Whiskers.
Country people often devote the profit of a certain 
part of their garden to the church treasury. The 
Whisker idea is the same. Its profits will be de
voted to the cause of athletics.
One cent per copy at all news-stands.
With the above scare-head adorning the front page 
of its four pages of edifying and hirsutian literature, 
Whiskers, one of the most unique college papers 
yet evolved in the brain of a mad undergraduate, ap
peared in chapel at Allegheny College Wednesday 
morning, January 25th. Whiskers is not a yellow 
journal, it is red, the lurid complexion of the sheet 
probably an attempt to match the general color of 
the moustaches exhibited by its subscribers. Whisk
ers is devoted entirely to the cultivation of all 
known hirsute evidences of manly strength, anything 
from side-burns to goatee, in a wordwhiskers.
The paper, a 5x8 sheet, is cleverly gotten np and is 
backed by the leading men of the school. The entire 
reading matter, and advertising matter as well, is 
devoted to the advancing of the cause of whiskers 
and to the denunciation and confoundation of that 
potent enemy, the Barbers Trust. The Tartan 
wishes every success to its latest contemporary. 
Heres to Whiskers!
MUTTS BI-ANNUAL BANQUET'
Last Friday evening was the occasion of the bi
annual banquet of the Mutts.
A full quoto was present. The food was of the 
best. The service was fine. The refreshments were 
varied. Toward the wee small hours good feeling 
ran rife. With the smoke came song after song, 
which cheered the heart, in preparation for a new 
terms work.
After a period of quiet, the Mutts are here, stronger 
than ever. They are fast taking a prominent place as 
an organization which promotes good work and good 
fellowship in the Civil Department.

Louis L. Moore, of North East, Pa., died at his 
home on January 29th, 1911, of typhoid pneumonia. 
Mr. Moore was a first year man in Day School of 
Applied Industries, and had been ill since Christ
mas. After vacation he came back to his studies, 
but felt so badly that Dr. Thomas advised him to 
return home, which he did. Mr. Moore was held in 
high regard by his classmates and had maintained 
a very good standing in his class. Letters of con
dolence were sent by Dean Connelly, by the Fac
ulty, and by his classmates.
The Yale University catalogue for the year 1910-11 
shows 506 officers on the faculty rolls and 3282 stu
dents.

Carnegie Technical Schools
A NEW SEMESTER
One half of the 1910-11 school year has rolled into 
the past, carrying with it memories of many and 
varied experiences, battles fought, struggles won 
or lost, scraps, feeds, games, functions, scrapesall 
the wonderful life of a living school. We are stand
ing on the threshold of the new semester, fewer in 
numbers tis true, but firm and willing to accept 
those gifts or trials with which Dame Fortune may 
see fit to favor us.
It is a fascinating hour for us as we stand peering 
as best we can into the dim and misty months before 
us. What magnificent possibilities we seem to pos
sess as we view them in the bright glittering sun
light of a fresh dawn! What a wonderfully promis
ing land lays before us! Small wonder that we are 
content to forget the past night, with its fearful bug
bears of examinations, grinding study and midnight
oil none too judiciously spent! Even the few dimly 
burning candles of past festivities, golden hours of 
fellowship and pleasure, fail to divert our eager 
minds from the absorbing task of looking ahead. 
What will befall is a more potent factor than what 
has befallen. The past falls dead before the anxious 
rush into the unknown future.
Now is the time to grasp firmly these golden hours 
with their spirit of optimism and hope. Make the 
most of them. A splendid finish generally means 
careful and earnest endeavor at the beginning of the 
race. We are building our foundation now and our 
foundation must be true and honest if our structure 
is to withstand the buffets and onslaughts of the
final reckonings. Gaze back for a moment into the 
dark abyss we have just crossed, a sea in which 
some of our comrades are still making a last desper
ate strugglethen turn resolutely to the front and 
begin the steady, steady pull which means a glorious 
windupsuccess.
VISITORS AT TECH.
INFORMATION CONCERNING EUROPEAN TRIP 
CAN BE HAD AT THE SECRE
TARYS OFFICE.
All of those fortunate persons who have that 
wherewith to take a trip to England may obtain in
formation concerning a personally conducted tour 
which is scheduled to leave about June 24th, by in
quiring at the office of the Secretary.
PENNSYLVANIA CHOCOLATE COMPANY IN
VITES
One of the evidences of the growing prominence of 
Carnegie Tech among the business men of Pittsburgh 
is shown in an invitation extended by the Pennsylva
nia Chocolate Co. to the students of Carnegie Tech to 
visit their factory at Center avenue.
Competent guides will be available and the pro
cesses of manufacture will be fully explained. This 
offer should be of especial interest to the Margaret 
Morrison students in its relation to the study of 
food values and domestic economy.
Every student in the Schools should try to take 
advantage of the opportunity afforded.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
The Carnegie Mechanical Society will meet on 
Saturday, February 11th, at 8.15 P. M., and hear an 
illustrated lecture on water purification by the wellknown authority, Mr. Greth, manager of Wm. B. 
Scaife & Sons Co. Mr. Greth will give in his lec
ture particular attention to the purification of boiler 
feed water.
While the attendance at these meetings of the 
society has up till now been very good, yet there is 
room for improvement in this connection, and it is 
to be hoped that this coming meeting will show an 
improvement. Mr. Greth has read different papers 
to various societies the past year and has kindly 
prepared this one specially for this meeting. Re
freshments, as usual, will be served after the lec
ture.
Visitors of the week included President Luther of 
Trinity College, Dean Fine of Princeton, Swami 
Bhumanand of Calcutta, India, and Dr. Margaret B. 
Wilson of the Normal College of the City of New 
York.

THE TARTAN
| THE DEANS COLUMN |
!****"********u*I
To the Editors: 
With great pleasure I have read the preceding 
articles in this column. Student service and stu
dent activities are of vital importance. But, may I 
make a plea for more quietness in the service, and 
fewer and less audible, unnecessary vibrations in the 
activities? In short, less noise!
In the fast-whirling, automobile-buzzing, air-shipwh-zzing age in which we live, so much of our en
vironment seems to be made up of explosives, crash
ing, smashing, discordant sounds that it will require 
a united effort to minimize the irritating conditions 
of our boasted civilization.
Much emphasis should be placed upon the value 
of silence, peace and quiet. The delight of medita
tion and the charm of the imaginative life seem to 
be almost lost. We should insist upon singing, in
stead of screechingand upon hearing the pedal 
note of the organ and the soft melody of the upper 
register, rather than the continual scream of the 
throttle valve and the perpetual letting off of steam, 
figuratively and literally.
It is often said that there are no birds in Pitts
burgh. This is not true, for one of them was sing
ing in a hedge on Morewood Avenue last week and 
others in a garden in the very heart of the city. 
Eird notes are really in the air, but they are almost 
drowned by the discord of the streets. It is neces
sary to listen attentively and continuously in order 
to hear these softer and sweeter sounds. But we 
cannot stop to listen! The spirit of this mechanical 
age is upon us:
Up and down 
To and fro 
We rush and run, we come 
And go 
In never ending motion.
Here and yon 
Toil and care 
At home, abroad, seems all 
Our share;
What cure for this? What potion?
Yet we dream 
All day long 
Of peace and restfor which 
We long 
To end this great commotion!
One way to secure this peace is to lessen the noise 
of the world in generaland our special corner of 
it in particular. A crusade against unnecessary 
noise can begin with the oiling of squeaking machin
ery, domestic and other kinds, and with the modu
lating of high pitched voicesindoors and out. This 
does not, of course, refer to those great shouts
from mighty men, which are most appropriate on 
the athletic field, but to the cultivation of a habit 
of gentle speech and quiet movemept in the routine 
of every day affairs. It is not necessary to set 
things down with a thud, or bang, or clatter; how
ever emphatic or strong this may make one appear. 
Nor is it weak-minded to step softly and speak 
gently.
It is not at all amazing that we cannot hear the 
birds. Wise creatures they are! They must be 
quite afraid of competing with our high-toned voices 
for fear of losing their own charmshould they succeer in outscreeching us.
Our school buildings have the great advantage of 
being set apart from the traffic and clamor of the 
city streets, with their bells, gongs and whistles. 
We are in green pastures. Our outlook is over 
rolling greensward clothed with trees and flowers. 
Above us we have clouds and clearness by day, and 
the moon and stars by night. The constant view of 
these beauties of nature
. . . . can so inform
The mind that is within us, and so impress 
With quietness and beauty, and so feed 
With lofty thoughts . . .
that we should mark 
the difference between the silent reposeful activity 
of nature and our own noisy endeavors.
We are many hundreds of people who benefit by 
the wonderful environment in which our schools are 
placed. If we will, we can help to lessen noise and 
confusion. We can begin with our own speech and 
movementswith our own homes and class rooms, 
and so increase the order and dignity of our lives.
Then we shall store strength and energy, and be 
able to think more calmly and justly; to act more 
deliberately. Perhaps, also, we shall be able to hear 
the birds sing in Pittsburgh, in spite of the sound 
of the Forbes Street cars on the down grade.

The Seniors and Juniors had a game of basket ball 
last Monday, in wrhich the Seniors won 310. The 
score looks as if the Juniors had not played up, but 
in truth the team work on both sides was splendid. 
Only at intervals did the Juniors relax their vigi
lance, but in those intervals the Seniors scored. A 
word to the wise is sufficiency.

well presented was very interesting.
After the business, refreshments were served. The 
meeting closed in a spirit of good-fellowship which 
always makes a C. E. meeting something to be re

SCHOOL OF APPLIED DESIGN
The first term of this scholastic year closed Fri
day, February 24th. It has been marked by many un
usual features that have set it apart from the previ
ous terms.
In the department of Architecture the work in de
signs has been especially meritorious. The work sub
mitted this term has excelled the excellent work of 
previous years. A number of these designs will be 
included in the annual exhibition of the Pittsburgh 
Architectural Club.
The prize offered by Prof. Sparks, for the best free
hand drawing submitted by a student of the archi
tectural department was won by E. F. Griffith. Mr. 
Griffith is to be complimented upon his work, which 
is of a very high standard. A number of freehand 
drawings of special merit are on exhibition in Room 
313. Mr. W. F. Burkharts line drawing of orna
ment is very creditable and is specially commended 
by the jury.
The prize for the best freehand drawing work sub
mitted by students of the Department of Illustration 
was awarded to Mr. Murvine of the Night Life Class.
A number of artistic and beautiful designs for the 
new Tartan cover have been submitted by the stu
dents of the School of Applied Design.
The Departments of Decorating and Illustration 
are the proud possessors of two young sculptors, 
Miss Sue E. Watson, and Frank S. Keally. Miss Wat
son, who was so highly praised some time ago upon 
the completion of her first work in modelling from 
life, a bust of Judge McKenna, has now completed 
the second of her masterpieces, a life size bust of Col. 
Edward J. Allen. The work is that of an experienced 
artist rather than that of a student. Miss Watson 
has been working on this bust only a little more than 
a month and a half. It is at present in the studio of 
August Zeller; curator of the Hall of Sculpture of the 
Carnegie Institute, and will be shown at the Art So
ciety Exhibit, given under the direction of C. R. Newlett, and also at the Pittsburgh Architectural Club 
exhibition.
Mr. Frank Keally has lately completed a life size 
bust of his uncle, Mr. Allen Keally, which was be
gun last September. It is Mr. Keallys first work 
in modelling from life, and in it he has shown the 
ability and the ambition to become a sculptor. His 
intention is to cast the work in bronze. It will also
be shown at the exhibit of the Pittsburgh Architec
tural Club and the Art Society.
The students of this school held their semi-annual 
meeting Tuesday, January 31s, for the election of of
ficers for the ensuing semester. The following stu
dents were elected by an unanimous vote: President, 
W. F. Burkhart; Vice President, C. E. Moss; Sec
retary and Treasurer, W. H. Crosby; Tartan Repre
sentative, J. Horton Barber; Tiler, F. Griffith.
The following students were also elected at a 
previous meeting as second assistant managers: 
Baseball, D. Fitzgibbon; hockey, H. C. Franks; track, 
C. Flock; basket ball, L. Bradley.
13
The Architects will hold a smoker at the Fort Pitt 
Hotel Monday, February 13th. This promises to be 
the swellest affair in the history of the school.
On the fifteenth of February the Tech Design Club 
will give an Valentine Dance at the Stanton Heights 
Golf Club.
