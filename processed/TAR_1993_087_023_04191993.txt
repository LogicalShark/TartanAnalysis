New resolution fails to
serve student body
The Resolution Concerning 
ROTC Students Rights on 
Campus to be considered at 
the Senate meeting tomorrow 
night is, quite simply, based 
on a fallacy. In the new reso
lution, Senator James Brown 
(CIT) claims that the Resolu
tion Against Discrimination 
by ROTC at Carnegie Mellon, 
passed in the fall of 1991, dis
criminates against students 
in ROTC. He is wrong. The 
old resolution is in no way 
directed at the students in the 
Department of Defense (DoD)- 
sponsored program. It does 
recommend sanctions against 
the ROTC program itself, be
cause the DoD and, by exten
sion, ROTC discriminate 
against gay, lesbian, and bi
sexual students. This dis
crimination is in direct viola
tion of the Statement of As
surance, and condemnation of 
the program as it stands is 
perfectly appropriate.
Brown says that students in 
ROTC are being discrimi
nated against because they 
cannot participate in Activi
ties Fee-funded events as 
ROTC. Brown ignores the fact 
that, according to the bylaws, 
no group which discriminates 
in any way can receive fund
ing to participate in such 
events. He also ignores the 
fact that students in Naval 
ROTC can and do take part in 
Carnival as the Society of the 
Prow, which any student can 
join, and that Army ROTC 
and Air Force ROTC could 
very easily form similar orga
nizations  as was suggested 
during the original debate. So 
it is very possible for students
An open letter to President 
Mehrabian and the Board of 
Trustees:
With the impending destruc
tion of Skibo looming on the 
horizon, it is time to question 
whether or not going ahead 
with the demolition is the cor
rect decision at this time. Re
cently, Student Senate passed 
a resolution calling for the 
demolition to be delayed. We 
agree, and feel that there are 
many issues yet to be resolved.
One important justification 
for the delay is that the Naval 
Reserve Building will not be 
ready for organizations to 
move into until sometime in 
the fall. What will happen 
until the Naval Reserve Build
ing is ready if there is no 
Skibo? Forcing organizations 
to move to a temporary loca
tion and then to the Naval 
Reserve Building does not 
seem very reasonable, espe
cially if one of these moves 
were to occur while the se
mester is in progress. It would 
prove nearly impossible to co
ordinate such a move for some 
larger organizations, even if 
the added cost of moving all 
Skibo-housed student groups 
twice wasnt enough reason 
to think hard about these 
plans.
While it may seem irratioin ROTC to be involved without 
having to do so as part of a dis
criminatory organization.
The proposed resolution also 
claims that a referendum ... 
clearly showed that the students 
were not in favor of the actions of 
Student Senate....  In truth, the 
difference in the referendum vote 
was statistically insignificant and 
its meaning was debatable.
In addition, the resolution states 
that while the militarys position 
runs counter to the spirit of the... 
Statement of Assurance, it re
mains within the letter. The 
Human Relations Commissions 
(HRC) report on the issue says 
that this is absolutely not true. 
The report urges the University 
to be concerned about the DoDs 
policy of discrimination, and fur
ther says that this policy is in 
conflict with our Statement of 
Assurance. We agree with the 
HRC on this point, and urge Sen
ate to consider the entire report.
Finally, the resolution Brown 
proposed claims that the original 
resolution is filled with fallacies 
and half-truths, and is unrealistic 
and overly extreme in its re
quests. We challenge Brown to 
point out these fallacies, and to 
address them directly, rather than 
compounding them with vague 
references and aimless attacks.
If Brown was paying any atten
tion last year, when the original 
resolution was extensively de
bated, he would realize that, given 
the circumstances, Senate 
handled the situation in the best 
way possible. It is time for Stu
dent Senate to move forward, not 
backward. Any action other than 
voting down the proposed resolu
tion would most definitely be a 
step backward.
nal to put more money into Skibo 
for repairs and upkeep at this 
point, consider the quality of life 
on campus were Skibo to be torn 
down this summer. The many fa
cilities Skibo houses would be un
available to students until the 
Naval Reserve Building would be 
ready, and the exact date when 
the building will be ready is yet to 
be determined. Quality of life is 
often cited as a problem on this 
campus, and tearing down Skibo 
prematurely and without the 
proper planning will only exacer
bate the situation.
There are many unanswered 
questions concerning the develop
ment of this campus. When will 
Skibo be tom down? When will all 
the organizations and offices in 
Skibo have to move? When will 
the Naval Reserve Building be 
ready? Though the University es
timates that the building will be 
available around September 1, and 
plan to complete remodeling some
time between October and Decem
ber, the plans remain tentative. 
The only hard fact which is cur
rently known about the Naval 
Reserve Building is that the Navy 
still occupies it.
On the other hand, Skibo defi
nitely needs repair and is impor
tant to maintaining any kind of 
decent quality of life on campus. 
Wait until December before tear
ing Skibo down.

Preregistration at no cost.
You can take advantage of either of the 
following methods:
1. On April 26 and 27,1993, between the hours of 9 am and 4:30 pm, in Grey Matter 
of Skibo, we will be taking network preregistrations for summer and fall connections. If 
you will be living on campus during the summer and/or fall, you can take advantage of 
preregistration. By preregistering, you will have the advantage of going into your new 
room, plugging your computer into your IBM outlet and being immediately connected to 
the network. This will save you from having to wait up to five working days for your 
outlet activation to be completed.
2. If you previously had a network connection, you may get a re-activation from your 
RA. Fraternity and Sorority members can obtain re-activation forms from their House 
President. Please fill the form out completely and either send it by Campus Mail by using 
preprinted address or drop it off in UCC 102. These forms are for re-activation only.
If you have not previously had a network connection for your Mac or PC, you can 
purchase connection equipment (between the IBM outlet and your computer) from the 
Computer Store. Included in the documentation package is a connection form.
Starting the week of May 17,1993, we will begin to activate summer 
preregistrations.
There will be no charge to activate or reactivate your dormitory outlet. If you have any 
questions or comments, please call Data Communications at x2635 or send mail to 
dcOm@andrew.
Try our new and improved formula!
After months of marketing surveys, laboratory experiments, nationwide 
taste-tests, and consultations with dietary experts, Forum has increased

stomped on Washington & Jefferson College, win
ning the top five individual places for a 413-462 
win.
Lee was individual medalist, shooting a 79. 
Inkenhaus shot an 80 while Sullivan shot an 82, 
taking second and third, respectively. Lassan and 
freshman Rick Rothrauff tied for fourth with scores 
of 86.
On Thursday, the Tartans travelled to Cleveland 
for the Case Western Reserve University Invita
tional, where the team finished fourth.
Head coach Rich Erdelyi was pleased with the 
team's performance. Our kids were competitive. 
We finished fourth of eleven teams, and they gave 
100 percent in pretty severe conditions, said 
Erdelyi.
John Carroll won the meet by defeating Malone 
College on a playoff hole. Both schools finished 
with a total of 323 strokes during regulation. Mt. 
Union finished third with a 329, and the Tartans 
were next with a 344.
Elliott led the Tartans with an 85, while Lee and 
Sullivan shot 86 each. Lassan shot an 87 and 
Inkenhaus shot an 88 to round out the top five for
the Tartans.
We shot very well on the front nine, then the 
weather conditions changed. The top three teams 
all went off in the earlier flight, so when they 
played, it was sunny, 80 degreees and nice. Then, 
the temperature dropped 30 degrees and the wind 
picked up. All our kids played five strokes worse 
on the back nine.
Today, the Tartans will travel to Washington & 
Jefferson to compete in that schools invitational. 
Thursday and Friday, the Tartans will host the 
Engineers Cup tournament at Longue Vue Coun
try Club. Six schools, CMU, Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti
tute, New Jersey Tech, Case Western Reserve, and 
Worchester Polytechnic Institute, will be compet
ing in the tournament.
We have a big week coming up. For this week
end, we have six of the best division III engineering 
schools competing. Rochester and Emory are 
always hard to beat. If we play well, I think we can 
challenge, said Erdelyi.
Overall, Im pleased with the way the season 
has gone. We won all three dual matches and 
placed well in all the rest.

Track teams turn out impressive 
performances in the past week
TRACK, from page 7
Four of the top five spots in the 400m hurdles 
belonged to the Tartans. McDowell took second at 
65.01, followed by: Long (56.29), Haley (57.14), and 
Conley (57.52).
Freshman E.J. Tsangaris took second in discus 
with a 132 foot 6 inch throw. Another freshman, 
Marty Wick came in fourth at 122 feet 5 inches. 
Wick then placed second in the javelin with a throw 
of 164 feet 61/2 inches. Senior Jim Hodges placed 
fourth at 162 feet 11 inches, followed by freshman 
Shigehiro Kanaya at 161 feet 8 3/4 inches.
Freshman Demi Carrothers placed third in the 
shotput at 43 feet 101/2 inches.
The final event was the 4x400-meter relay. 
Carnegie Mellons B team of Thompson, Rea, 
Helms, and McDowell took second with a time of 
3:22.6 seconds.
Gary Meckley, the men's head coach commented 
on his teams performance. I was very pleased. I 
thought we did very, very well. Just about every
body got a season best and personal best time. The 
drop in time over this past week is almost unbe
lievable.
Meckley commended his athletes on their effort. 
Outdoor season in the spring is full of distractions. 
Between Spring Break, Easter, Carnival, and fi
nals, there is always something else ontheirminds.
The Carnegie Mellon University Womens Invi
tational was held on Wednesday, April 14atGesling 
Stadium. From Division I were Duquesne Univer
sity and Robert Morris College; from Division II 
was University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown; and from 
Division III was Grove City College and host CMU.
The Duquesne Dukes won the meet, accumulat
ing 69 points. Robert Morris beat out PittJohnstown for second, 57 to 56. Grove City was 
fourth with 48 points and the Tartans finished last 
with 23.
We were decimated by sickness and performed
really badly, head coach Dario Donatelli said. 
We're focusing first on getting healthy. Then we're 
focusing on the UAA meet.
There's just so many question marks. We're 
kind of down. Things aren't looking realy good.
Nevertheless, there were some impressive indi
vidual performances by the Tartans.
Junior Mary Moore was second in the shotput 
with a throw of 33 feet 7 inches. Sophomore 
Meredith McKnight was fifth in the event, with a 
throw of 28 feet 4 inches.
In the 1500-meter race, senior Wendy Evans 
finished in fifth place.
Coming down the stretch, it looked like Evans 
would have an outside chance of catching the third 
place runner, Kristin Cooper of Duquesne. Unfor
tunately, she was unable to catch her, and was 
passed by Nichole Archer of Grove City with only 
five meters to go. Senior Sheila Skaff of CMU 
finished in eleventh place.
Freshman sensation Missy Baustert continued 
her winning ways with a third place finish in the 
100-meter high hurdles. Her time of 16.3 was only
1.5 seconds off the leader, Jackie Gray of Robert 
Morris.
In the long jump event, freshman Dawn Balazs 
was eighth with a jump of 14 feet three-quarters 
inches. She then competed in the javelin, earning 
a fourth place finish with a throw of 97 feet 2.25 
inches. Sophomore Jen Gretz was sixth with 94 
feet 1 inch.
Senior Tracy Howard finished fifth in the 800- 
meter race with a time of 2:38.5. Sophomore Karen 
Bryla finished eleventh in 2:53.3.
McKnight had the only individual win, taking 
the discus with a throw of 96 feet 11 inches. Moore 
came in sixth with a throw of 86 feet 8.5 inches.
Gretz was eleventh throwing 65 feet 2.75 inches.
Junior Cynthia Kolanowsld was third in the 
3000-meter race, 5.2 seconds behind the second 
place finisher, Wendy Beaver of Duquesne.
The final event of the meet was the 1600-meter 
relay. The relay team finished fourth with a time of

On Sunday, some of the womens track team also 
participated in the University of Pittsburgh Open. 
Stephanie Stine, a freshman chemical engineering 
major, ran her season best on Sunday in the 100 
and 200 yard races with finishing times qf 13.6 
seconds and 28.0 seconds.
I guess I was really prepared for the meet. I got 
a lot of sleep and had a good breakfast. Im hoping 
for a chance to make finals in the 200 the UAA

on those involved in the Carnival 
buggy races this past weekend. 
Between all of the rainedand 
snowed - out roll days and the icy 
drizzle on both race days, it didnt 
look like any trophies would be 
given out. Whether an adminis
trator performed a sun dance or 
paid off the some rain prevention 
guru is not known at this time  
all that is known is that miracu
lously, the buggy races did hap
pen and, to say the least, were a 
bit capricious this time around. 
It looks like Compubookie may 
need to reevaluate its methods of 
prediction.
All the teams were exceedingly 
competitive this year, some with 
new push teams, others with new 
buggies. And there were the occa
sional mishaps and humorous 
moments to go along with this. A 
spin out before the chute between 
PhiKap Bs Centennial and CIAs 
Conquest occurred when the CIA 
buggy hit into Centennial, as it 
tried to pass Betas B buggy, Mer
cury. Rerolls 
were given to 
both teams in
volved in the 
collision. Spirit 
Bs buggy, Tachyon rolled 
backward as it 
approached 
Hill 4. Tachyon 
was attempt
ing to pass 
PiKA Cs Ren
egade, when it 
came close to 
colliding and 
slowed down. 
This hurt 
Spirits chance 
for yet another 
trophy.
The comic re
lief for final 
race day was 
SAEs Limo as 
it slowly made 
its way along 
the course. The 
large shoebox
like buggy 
needed push
ers to help it
Jennifer Urso/Tarta Photo Editor
through the freeroll section of the 
course near Phipps Conservatory. 
The buggy rolled so slowly that 
those riding in the chase car got 
frustrated and passed it. It was 
certainly SAEs version of the 
Marx Brothers, A Day at the 
Races.
Womens Buggy Races: For a
while it looked like the Spirit A 
womens push team was going to 
bring Shaka Zulu home for an
other trophy in their case, but a 
lane violation disqualified the 
team. Their disqualification 
pushed PiKA Bs womens buggy, 
Maverick, into first place with a 
time of 2:38.69. And thanks to a 
few powerhouse pushers, PhiKap 
As womens team, pushing Secre
tariat, finished a surprising sec
ond with a time of 2:49.29. Not 
far behind was Spirit Bs womens 
team, which, with a time of 
2:50.59, managed to hold ground 
in the top three.
Mens Buggy Races. It looked 
close this year. For the past three 
years PiKA has been determined 
to the win the first place title 
Spirit has held onto so tightly. 
But despite how close things 
looked when both teams reached 
Hill 5, Spirit won again with a 
time of2:10.43. PiKA A came in a 
close second withatimeof2:ll.26. 
Beta A made a strong comeback 
after its A team buggy split in two 
before race day last year. They 
finished off the race with their 
new buggy Evenflow with a time 
of2:14.19.
Finishing in fourth place this 
year with a time of 2:14.34, was 
Phi Kaps Secretariat. After win
ning the reputation of chute spin
ners, this fraternity has come 
back in the last two years with 
placements in the top 5. And fi
nally, Sigma Nus Abuggy, Jama, 
came in a close fifth with a time of 
2:14.93.
The top five teams all have the 
potential to move up in line with 
both their buggy technology and 
the strength of their pushers. As 
the competition becomes tighter, 
the race days ahead should be
come more cutthroat. Not even 
Compubookie can properly pre
dict what is going to happen next 
year.

LAThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 April 1993
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Contributing Editor
This years crop of independent 
(non-Greek) booths showed once 
again the dedication and talent 
of organization members. A lot of 
time and work went into many of 
the booths, which added color and 
entertainment to the Midway.
Pioneers
Wonderful World of Disney 
Animation
The Booth: This years first 
place independent booth recre
ated Cinderellas castle, complete 
with Pinocchio and Jiminy 
Oricketperched among the battle
ments and The Little Mermaids 
Flounder spouting water out 
front. Inside the solid two-story 
structure were brief histories of 
the Disney animated movies on a 
long piece of "celluloid the 
stretched along the booths walls. 
I agree with the judges that this 
was the most beautiful of the in
dependent booths.
The Game: Players looked 
through a movie camera and 
tried to identify pictures ofDisney 
animated characters. The com
puterized game unfortunately 
wasnt working when I visited 
the booth  it ran into a glitch or 
two during the weekend. Un
daunted, the booth operators had 
modified the game so visitors 
could still play.
FRINGE
Willy Wonka and the Choco
late Factory
The Booth: FRINGES booth 
took second place in independent 
booth. The booth was a candymaking machine in the factory 
with a wrought iron gate in 
front. Inside the door a funny 
contract was posted absolving the 
"factory of any responsibility for 
anything. Sinco the line was of
ten long, the contract gave visi
tors something to do, and it was 
worth reading.
The Game: In my opinion, this
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy and President Robert Mehrablan

Spirit offers a car wash. Kevin Chen/Tartan Photographer
was the best game of all the inde
pendent booths, though it took a 
long time. Players used a series 
of plungers to bounce a golden 
eggthroughanumberoflevels. If 
they did that successfully, they 
had to shoot the egg through a TV 
screen with a catapult, then take 
it to the top of a pegboard with an 
elevator. The egg ended up going 
through one of a number of holes 
at the bottom of the pegboard. 
One hole labeled it a "bad egg, 
the rest as a "good egg. Good 
eggs earned prizes for players.
SDC
The Princess Bride
The Booth: The third-place in
dependent booth this year, SDC
gave Camival-goers a version of 
the fire swamp from The Princess 
Bride, complete with vines, 
flame spurts, and lightning 
sand. 1
The Game: Another high-tech 
game, The Princess Bride re
quired players to go through the 
fire swamp by stepping on tiles 
equipped with sound effects for 
flame spurts and lightning sand. 
The goal was to avoid getting 
caught in a flame spurt or the 
lightning sand.
ASA
Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles
The Booth: Visitors to ASAs 
booth descended into a sewer lit
tered with Dominos pizza boxes, 
finding themselves in the home 
of the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles. At the entrance to the 
booth were Donatello and 
Raphael, while Michelangelo and 
Leonardo lounged inside.
The Game.'Players tossed pepperonis onto a pizza from about 
five feet away if they were grown
ups, closer if they were kids. 
Grown-ups had to land the pepperonis on one of two mushroom 
slices, while kids just had to get 
them to land on the pizza.
CIA
Indiana Jones and the Temple 
of Despair
The Booth: CIAs booth was
relatively simple, a cave with the 
maze inside.
The Game: Visitors used a mag
net to move Indys hat through a 
wooden maze. The goal was to get 
the hat from the beginning to the 
end of the maze without drop
ping it and within 45 seconds.
Hockey Club
The Mighty Ducks
The Booth: Simple and well 
done, the Hockey Clubs booth 
was a hockey rink. Inside was a 
net guarded by a wooden goalie.
The Game'. Would-be hockey 
players shot a puck at the net, 
trying to get it through one of the 
openings left by the wooden 
goalie.
Lambda Sigma
Star Wars
The Booth: The best part was 
the great mural ofStar Wars char
acters on the side. Fortunately, 
Lambda Sigma had an end spot, 
so the mural was easily visible to 
passersby.
The Game: Players had to swing 
Star Wars action figures on 
strings through three holes - 
one each for Star Wars, The Em
pire Strikes Back, and Return of 
the Jedi.
Society of the Prow
Battle of Midway
The Booth: Society of the Prow 
constructed the fire control cen
ter of a ship with gun turrets.
The Game: Wearing helmets to 
protect them from shrapnel, 
players dropped bombs on mod
els of Japanese aircraft carriers.
Spirit
Dee Spirit Carwash
The Booth: Spirits booth came 
complete with great props  an 
air hose to fill tires, a bubble gum 
machine, the first dollar on the 
wall, and a ladies room door. The 
walls sported realistic paintings 
of cars.
The Game: Spirits game was 
basic basketball with a carwash 
twist  players tried to land the 
ball in a bucket. I thought Spirit 
had the best prizes of the inde
pendent booths  candy for ev
eryone, win or lose; candy and a 
keychain for one basket; candy, a 
keychain, and a stuffed car for 
two baskets. Booth operators 
would also take a Polaroid of visi
tors in the booth for free, whether 
they played the game or not.
Swim Team
The Booth: The Swim Teams 
annual dunk tank. The Swim 
Team booth doesnt compete for a 
prize, but how could you have a 
Carnival without a dunk tank?
The Game: You know how it 
works.

Kappa Alpha Theta wins sorority booth 
competition with The Little Mermaid
By KEEGAN FOLK
Tartan Personnel Manager
Four sororities participated in 
this years Booth competition. In 
case you missed the fun, here is a 
quick review of what each group 
constructed as their booth in or
der of points awarded.
Kappa Alpha Theta
The Little Mermaid
TheBooth: Underthe Sea with 
Theta was quite impressive. The 
outside represented Prince Erics 
castle while the inside was sup
posed to be under water near a 
sunken ship. The coolest thing 
was that all the little fish swim
ming around on the interior walls 
were ones the sisters reproduced 
from the film. We think its oneof 
Thetas best booths in the last 
couple of years. Its a really fun 
booth, said Tara Phillips, senior 
and social and decision sciences 
major. They even had the sound 
track from the film playing.
TheGame: Standing on the deck 
of the sunken ship, players tried 
to toss bean bags into the shells of 
giant sea clams.
Delta Delta Delta
A League of their Own
The Booth: The Tridelts booth 
this year resembled a concession 
stand on the outside and a dugout facing onto a baseball field 
inside. The walls were lined with 
cute photos of sisters in baseball 
outfits and other baseball memo
rabilia.
I think we did a lot more than 
last year. Our booth chairman 
did wonders with no budget, said 
Kristin Carbone, junior music 
major and tridelt sister. She sure 
did. The authentic astro turf was 
my favorite part.
The Game: Players stood on the 
pitchers mound and threw balls 
at the catchers mitt to try to 
strike out the batter. The winner 
had their choice of a selection of 
baseball cards. According to the 
sisters the Pirates cards were by 
far the most popular.
Delta Gamma
Jaws
The Booth'. I was really im
pressed with the sick sense of 
humor displayed in this years 
Delta Gamma booth.
The head of Jaws rose majesti
cally out of the asphalt, bloody 
teeth and all.
Its been fun seeing the reac
tions of people, said Melissa 
Azur, junior psychology m^jor and 
Delta Gammas vice-president of 
scholarship.
No kidding (Jaws had a bloodspattered mannequin in its 
mouth).
The Game: This was the best 
part, definitely. They object was 
to toss beach rings around the 
limbs ofthe bloody mannequin to 
win prizes. They take first place 
in the Demented category.
Kappa Kappa Gamma
Bill and Teds Excellent Ad
venture
The Booth: The Kappas did a 
fine job this year on their rendi
tion ofthe Excellent Adventure. 
Carnival revelers entered into a 
scene from the Wild West. Amaz
ingly, Ancient Greece was only 
steps away in the next room. Here 
The Sands of Time were con
tained in what the sisters as
sured me was an authentic GreMy favorite part was actually 
the exterior which looked like a 
Circle K convenience store com
plete with ice machine.
The Game: In the Wild West, 
players could opt for a game of 
blackjack, or, ifin AncientGreece, 
players could sift through the 
sands of time to collect prizes 
hidden within.

SkyDiver and Gravitron promise fun
Late-night rides on the SkyDiver light up the Midway.
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Special to The Tartan
The Carnival Midway is split 
spacewise between organization 
booths and thrill rides  half 
glitz, half guts. Though the booth 
games may be fun and rewarding 
to the sweet tooth, nothing can 
get the adrenalin surging like a 
quick trip on the latest contrap
tion from the folks at J& J Amuse
ments.
J&J, the Ohio-based provider 
ofCMUs Carnival rides formany 
years, brought a fairly traditional 
lineup this season: the SkyDiver, 
the Sizzler, the Scooter, the Ferris 
wheel, the 
Super 
Round-Up, 
the Fun 
Slide, and 
the notorio u s 
Gravitron.
With 
steely eye 
and iron 
stomach, I 
set out to 
survey 
these fear
some engines of terror.
The (shudder) Gravitron
Nothing strikes fear into the 
heart of a ride reporter faster 
than the sight of the Gravitron 
spinning smugly on the corner of 
the Midway. This popular ride 
has been nn intermittent visitor 
for the past six Carnivals, and up 
until this year it had been my 
distinct pleasure nover to ride it. 
This year, however, my con
science (and my editor) told me to 
bite the bullet.
I climbed into the ride they call 
the Vomitron thinking of oFe 
contrifuge scene from Moonraker. 
Would I be crushed into powder? 
Everyono I FXL seen TeooGiT off 
the ride looked intact, if a bit 
unsteady. We Ce,e CX,ieL iao to 
BoGtk an, FXiLd Gioa oFe wall 
t,Xtkd, XiL iao to turn nfdGLe
down, and the wheel began to 
whirl.
Centrifugal force, the physics 
majors will say, is a red herring 
 not a real force at all. Tell that 
to the folks stuck to the Gravitron 
walls like static-charged balloons. 
The red cushions on the walls 
look innocent, until you realize 
that theyll slide toward the ceil
ing when the ride spins fast 
enough. Your hands grow heavy, 
your breathing Meta^eB labored, 
and that, I suppose, is when the 
fun starts.
I quickly discovered that the 
key to keeping my equilibrium 
was keeping my head flat against 
the cush
ion. If I held 
still, noth
ing seemed 
to be out of 
the ordi
nary. If I 
raised my 
head, how
ever, or 
turned it 
from side to 
side, the 
whole place 
lurched 
sickeningly about.
To me, the remarkable thing 
about the Gravitron is the opera
tor he spins along with the rest 
of the ride, looking remarkably 
composed through the whole ex
perience. I dont care what they 
pay him  hes due a bonus.
Fun Slide
After the mad whirl of the 
Gravitron, the Fun Slide was a 
welcome respite. This simple ride, 
now to Carnival this year, fea
tures only two moving parts: you 
and the burlap sack you sit on as 
you both slide down the bright 
yellow incline.
For four tickets, the thrill was 
brief. Still, the view from the top 
ofthe slide was goodI could see 
the roof of the Gravitron, and 
hear the shrieks from inside. It 
was also the best picture opporIt's not much fun to 
give a ten-year-old 
that first case of 
whiplash, unless you 
have some specific 
grudge to work off.
my stomach on the front, down
ward side of the wheel.lt almost 
goes without saying that the 
Ferris wheel is for couples par
ticularly, and the view from the 
top of this one was more than a 
little bitromantic. Unfortunately, 
the smooching was cut short on 
Friday evening when, according 
to Rides Chair Brian Papa, the 
wheel suffered a mechanical fail
ure and was taken out of service.
J&J removed the wheel from 
the Midway on Friday night and 
replaced it with the well-known 
Super Round-up, no doubt disap
pointing the couples who had 
planned on a Saturday evening 
Ferris wheel tryst.
SkyDiver
Once described to me as a 
Ferris wheel on LSD, this pe
rennial Carnival favorite towers 
over the Midway. One of the few 
rides which combines motor 
power with human muscle, the 
Diver was the top ride for thrill 
seekers this year.
The principle of the Diver is 
straightforward and altogether 
satanic. Where a Ferris wheel 
has cars that rotate freely on an 
axis parallel to the center axis of 
the wheel, the Divers cars rotate 
on an axis perpendicular to the 
center axis. This means that the 
familiar and comforting rightway-up rotation of the Ferris
wheel becomes a which-way-isup struggle for equilibrium on 
the Diver. I took a car to myself, 
which was a mistake. The indi
vidual spinning wheel mounted 
in each car requires the strength 
of two for proper operation, and I 
found myself rolling free, often 
upside-down, for most of the ride. 
The ride operators, seasoned pro
fessionals all, took what I as
sumed to be no small pleasure in 
giving each car a vicious spin as it 
passed the ride base.
Despite my lack of control  
and for some riders, the loss of 
keys and pocket change  the 
'Diver offers the best view of the 
Midway, Skibo roof, and the city 
beyond. From the top ofthe wheel, 
you can see which booths have 
well-detailed roofs, and you can 
easily smell the hot dogs and fun
nel cakes.
If the Diver returns next year, 
I recommend a sunset ride; the 
view of the evening sky beyond 
the Cathedral of Learning is one 
not to be missed.
Sizzler
This double-spinning ride tends 
to smash the outside passenger 
against the wall, and the inside 
passenger against the outside 
passenger. (Date tip, folks; shy 
people take note.) On a cold day, 
the wind can grow bitter as the 
Sizzler whirls around.
For some reason, this ride al
ways leaves me green and wob
bly. I think it may be the blurred 
sight of the people leaning over 
the fence, yelling Not here! 
Throw up that way!
Super Round-Up
This mid-Midway replacement 
for the Ferris wheel is well known 
to Carnival patrons. The massive 
spinning frame starts out on the 
ground, then tilts upward after 
reaching full speed. Its not un
like a Gravitron on stilts.
The Gravitron is enclosed, how
ever, and riders arent treated to 
the revolving scenery the way 
they are on the Round-Up. Once 
I was flat against the pad, I found 
it wise to close my eyes, since it 
was hard to distinguish anything 
from the encompassing whirl. I 
did hear a neighbor yellIcansee 
my room from here, but I believe 
he was lying. Once the Round-Up 
settles back in its base again, 
departing riders all seem to 
wobble slightly, myself no excep
tion.
After the Midway closes, ride 
die-hards hang around and watch 
as J&J workers perform carny 
origami. Folding and packing the 
huge rides into trailer-shaped 
containers is a neat trick not to be 
seen again until next April. In 
the meantime, theres always 
Kennywood. Happy riding!
tunity, as bystanders could snap 
shots from the bottom of the slide. 
On the whole, very restful.
Scooter Bumper Cars
The Scooter, or bumper car ride, 
is always a favorite with the 
younger set. In fact, when I 
boarded my snub-nosed gada
bout, I quickly realized that I was 
the oldest rider by at least 10 
years. I swore softly to myself 
that I would have no mercy on 
these kids; if they want to ride on 
the big rides, theyll have to be 
prepared to take the bruises.
As it turned out, the collisions 
were pretty tame; nobody had 
room to get up speed due to all the 
unoccupied cars on our shift. 
Danny, the five-year J&J veteran 
manning the ride, called out 
Turn yer wheel! so often I sus
pected he had a tape of it playing.
The trick to the Scooter, in my 
mind, is to bring a large group of 
friends with you on the ride  
that way, youll have easy targets 
to go after. It's not much fun to 
give a ten-year old that first case 
of whiplash, unless you have some 
specific grudge to work off.
The slide awaits riders.

LIO The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 April 1993
Variety of musical acts entertain audiences at Carnival
Live
After waiting a whole two hours 
past the time they were supposed 
to start, Live finally came onto 
stage at 4 pm. The lead singer, Ed 
Kowalczyk, started singing with 
the guitar player, Chad Taylor. 
But for a little while, I couldnt 
tell if they were still doing a sound 
check or if they were for real. I 
must have been stuck in that 
sound check zombie state after 
two hours of standing next to a 
speaker blasting feedback and a 
shaky bass drum into my ears.
Once the drummer and bassist 
joined in, I slowly snapped out of 
it and realized that the show had 
started  at last. They played 
some new songs which no one has 
ever heard, because their album 
doesnt come out until fall, along 
with about three of their old songs 
includingBeautyofGray,Pain 
Lies on the Riverside, and Op
eration Spirit. All of the songs 
sounded very together and 
loudish, but I noticed that the 
singer seemed to be living in fear 
of having the light stand fall on 
top of him. Hmm, maybe it was 
because people were crowd div
ing off the base of the stand.
It never occurred to me that a 
Live show would be violent and 
dangerous, but there we were, 
toying with electrocution while 
glistening to sort of mellow mod
ern rock. The music was just too 
ingratiatingfor me to put a death 
wish on mysolf. I felt like tapping 
my foot, not injuring the person 
noxt to me.
So it seems that this show, or 
this band, was a bit misunder
stood. Of course, people can al
ways interpret music however 
they want to, but having a person 
got thrown onto your head would, 
I would assume, be a bit distract
ing when you're trying to pay 
, attention to the band on stage.

Skablins
Yilces, it wns cold Saturday af
ternoon. But I ventured out into 
the tent to see the Skablins any
way. I figured, if they had to suf
fer, then I guess I was willing to 
bump up my two-time seeing of
them to three. After all, it was 
really cold out, and the only way 
to stay warm, in my opinion, was 
to dance to some ska.
After tuning up, doing a sound 
check, and all that fun blibber 
blabber, the Skablins started
You know how whenever you 
go to a show, the band comes on 
stage with a sort of air of superi
ority which makes you almost 
afraid to touch the speaker? Well, 
regardless of the fact that theyre 
a local band, because bandsinmy
playing the real stuff  and so high school acted like that, these 
the dancing began. Because if guys werent anything like that.
theres one thingthis band can do 
well, its to get people to actually 
get off their asses and dance.
It seemed like there were a lot 
of non-CMUers at the show, who 
incidentally, packed the tent.
Wow, extended contact with the 
outside world  Im not sure if hard core honwecanhandlesomethinglikethat esty and nonhere at CMU. But regardless of presumptuous 
all the people, the Skablins kept personality 
a good connection with everyone which their 
in the audience by inviting them stage presence 
up on stage at the end of the 
show. And how else can you end a 
Skablins show but by playing 
their version of the Rainbow 
Connection?
Even though they started a 
little late, their show was prob
ably the most successful out of all 
ofCarnival because: 1) no one got bum, all of 
killed or threatened by a swaying which tore away 
light Btand, 2) they threw away atthe guitar and 
their song list after about five 
minutes and still kept the show 
totally together, and 3) made the 
best out of the freezing weather 
by keeping us warm with their 
music.
 Jennifer Urso
They looked like they were up 
there to perform and do what 
they wanted to do, without trying 
to impress us, which is ultimately 
cool and appropriate, because 
their music had

nation of power and a certain 
tongue-in-cheek quality. The 
bands songs range from serious 
to fun. Their feminist death metal 
song, Virgin or Slut, demands 
that society make a place for 
strong women. Dancing in Our

cartoons and their influence on 
our childhood.

summed it up nicely with, We

They then proceeded to put on a 
very fun show. Mike Messer 
played guitar and sang. Glebs 
Infection consisted of Marty Riker 
on congas, Dan Bodwell on bass, 
and Rich Strong on the drums. 
The backup singers, who Messer 
referred to as Moist, were Jeff 
Edgerton and David Naronya. 
The set consisted of an electric

there was no music playing, they 
danced just to stay warm. It was 
snowing, the wind-chill factor 
seemed in the sub-zero range, 
and I think that all the die-hard 
fans who went to see their favor

Hurl
Hurl, one of Pittsburghs best 
bands, graced the corner stage at 
Spring Carnival 93. Actually, 
that EM an overstatement they 
only got to play one song. After 
they finally got on stage, about a 
half hour late because of trouble 
AB Tech had getting the sound 
system set up, Matt Jencik on 
vocals and bass, Mat Daly on 
guitar, Dan Wilson on guitar, 
and Dave Brunger on drums, were 
then told to turn down their sound 
system. They did this and were 
then told that they would have to 
stop playinguntil the judges were 
finishedjudgingthe booths. When 
they were going to go back on, 
they were told that they couldnt 
play because Live had it written 
in their contract that no one could 
be playing while they were on 
stage. Hurl was forced to pack 
their equipment up. Live did not 
start playing for an hour after 
Hurl was told they couldnt play. 
This is unfortunate, because their 
one song, Turnip, which is also 
their single, was fantastic and, 
as one who has seen them per
form before, began what could 
have been the best show at Car
nival.

fection
The whole conflict with Live 
looked like it was going to interupt 
the band which followed Hurl. 
Mike Messer and Gleb's Infec
tion were scheduled to play at 
4:30 pm at the comer stage and 
because of the delay that Live 
experienced, they were going on 
stage while Live was still playset and an acoustic set. The elec
tric part of the show was very 
reminiscent of Steely Dan and 
Seals and Croft. In other words, 
veiy 70s-like. Rock and roll with 
a very jazzy feel and a little funk 
thrown in. A lot of fun. The acousbecause people enjoy the blues." 
Unfortunately, a lot of pseudo 
wanna-be blues bands end up 
playing, because they know they 
can get gigs.
But I had seen this band before 
and enjoyed the interludes and

indication, he is destined for 
greatness.

The McKeg-Lawson band
The weather on Saturday was 
brutal. I went to see the McKegLawson band but couldnt take 
the weather. I only saw a handful 
of people there who were a lot
enjoying themselves despite the 
weather which made the music 
seem even better. The rest of the 
crowd (self included) danced un
til they forget the snow and wind.
I loved the groovy (and I mean 
that in the most complimentary 
fashion) sound of this band. The 
lead female vocalist had a strong 
and beautiful voice. She and the 
rest of the band had that special 
gift: they love playing music.
They played original material 
(or songs I never heard) with a 
verve and authentic enthusiasm 
that made its way through all the 
nastiness of the weather. I was 
impressed with a song that used 
a Shakespearean sonnet. People 
accuse rock bands of being pre
tentious when trying to combine 
high art in whats conceived as 
a trash culture medium: rock

---------------------------------------------------

The following is an account of an actual incident involving a 
currently enrolled Carnegie Mellon fraternity brother whose identity is 
known and who has not been prosecuted at this time for this incident due 
to lack of testimonial evidence. Charges based on the following incident 
wpuld include one felony count of kidnapping and one felony count of 
rape. This incident is not the only one in which this particular Carnegie 
Mellon fraternity brother has been involved: one other kidnapping and 
rape incident, very similar to this one, has occurred, and the Womens 
Center and Stop Rape now know that the perpetrator of these kidnappings 
and rapes has stalked and harassed at least one more woman. (None of 
these incidents bear any known connection to the Frew Street incidents 
of January and March). In neither of the kidnapping and rape cases was 
the woman involved being careless or drunk, none of the women 
involved in any of these incidents gave their consent, much less led him 
on, and no formal charges have been brought for any of the incidents, 
again due to lack of testimonial evidence. The Office of Student Affairs 
has been made aware of these incidents and of the identity of the 
perpetrator and can do nothing without the testimony of the two women 
known to have been kidnapped and raped or the woman known to have 
been stalked and harassed; these women refuse to testify because they 
are afraid and because they are convinced that the incidents will be 
easier for them to deal with if they are left in the past. The continuing 
threat to all women at Carnegie Mellonstudents, staff, faculty, guests 
and to all women with whom this individual and others like him come 
into contact is not, of course, something that can be left in the past.
She was careful at these parties  she didnt let anyone else 
make her decisions for her while she was here, and she never got into 
unfamiliar crowds without at least one of her friends around. She 
knew she shouldnt have to take those precautions  the guys didnt 
have to!  but she also knew that she did have to. To be fair, she 
also tried not to leap to conclusions about the people she met here, 
even if they acted like jerks in some ways, because she knew that 
their actions and statements werent always genuine in this sort of 
situation. And she did enjoy the parties, after all.
She was at a CMU fraternity party with a girlfriend one 
night. As usual, she didnt drink anything at all, and as usual, she 
didn't wander off into a group of new acquaintances without her 
friend. At one point during the evening, she went to look for the 
bathroom, leaving her girlfriend in another room with some guys 
they already knew. As she approached the bathroom, she felt an arm 
wrap around her waist from behind, and then someone was standing 
right behind her, pressing his body full against hers, and a voice 
whispered in her ear. Youre nice. Youre very nice." She tried to 
turn around to see who this was, but his other arm wrapped around 
her left shoulder and his hand touched her face, her cheek; he 
wouldnt let her turn around. His voice was low, smooth: Ive been 
watching you all night. Longer  Ive seen you around. Most of the 
girls at CMU are fat and ugly. But not you. Her stomach tightened: 
who was this guy? What was he doing to her? She knew that he 
thought he was being romantic, whispering to her, stroking her 
cheek, those were supposed to be the right things, but he made her 
skin crawl, standing so close, so immovable; she tried to push herself 
away from him, but he grasped her waist more tightly. I dont know 
you, she protested, but lie only continued with Not you. I follow 
you sometimes  after you work out and youre all sweaty and 
walking back to your dorm. I want us to get acquainted. Whats your 
name?" She gave him only her first name, a kind of protest, a 
defense. I just want to get to know you: lets go out to my car ...
there was no pause, no opening in his speech for her to intemipt and 
say that she was uncomfortable ... Dont worry, its no big deal; 
dont fight me or try to run away and embarrass me ... if you 
embarrass me ...  and he cupped her chin in his left hand and 
turned her head slowly to one side, slowly but firmly, until her head 
had moved as far to the left as it could go and her neck began to hurt 
with the strain. He held it far over to the left for a moment, letting 
her feel the pull, the strain in her neck: Please dont embarrass 
me.... He kissed the back of her neck and she could feel him 
smiling; he seemed so calm, so sure of himself, and she could hardly 
breathe; she felt as if she would suddenly gasp, loud, ugly, 
swallowing up air, such an ugly sound. Indelicate. But she couldnt. 
She couldn't make her body do anything at all, couldnt even think 
or imagine anything clearly, except for the clear impression of his 
kiss on the back of her neck, his kiss which made her whole neck 
feel filmy, her whole body grimy. And then, with his arm still around 
her waist and her chin still in his other hand, he walked her out of the 
house, his forehead leaning against hers, as if he were in conspiracy 
with her. They looked like longtime lovers leaving for the night. Her 
eyes were wide, searching desperately through her narrowed field of 
vision for someone who would make eye contact with her, see her 
panic, her bewilderment, but there was no one. No one paid the 
slightest attention to a couple so absorbed in each other, leaving for 
the night.
His car was nearby, of course  he was a brother in the 
house  and he made her get in on the drivers side and sit in the 
middle, never taking his hands off her. He started the car; she must 
have looked surprised, because he looked at her, held her chin in his 
hand again, and said, Im just taking us someplace a little quieter so 
we can talk." She pulled her head away and looked out the 
passengers side window so that he would have to stop touching her 
face, but he kept some part of his body always touching, always 
wound snugly around her, his arm, his face and hand at the 
stoplights. They arrived at his apartment and she lost all hope of 
seeing someone who would recognize her fear; he kept so close to 
her that she had no space to think, to distinguish herself from him, 
and no one would have known she wanted to run away, to push him 
down like a little kid in a sandbox, to scream, but she just couldnt 
seem to remember how to do any of those things. He took her into 
his bedroom, telling her all the while how pretty she was, how 
attractive, how ... nice. He took off her clothes as she stood, 
trembling, shutting out all thought of how this had begun, trying to 
ignore the fact that he had threatened her life. She thought, oddly, of 
her homework, what she had to do for Monday. She did nothing to 
encourage him, nothing to help him, and she could think of nothing 
to do to stop him, nothing that she was sure she could succeed in 
doing to stop him. She did not look at him. She did not feel at all. 
When she was naked and he had tossed her clothes out of easy reach, 
he began unbuckling his own belt, pushing down his jeans and 
boxers so that he could have sex with her but never removing any of 
his own clothing. He did not permit her to leave until 10 or II the 
following morning. He gave her breakfast: orange juice, a muffin. He 
told her his first name. And he let her have a shower; she was almost 
grateful for that.
When she arrived home, she took another shower and then 
threw herself into her homework. Later she tried to apologize to her 
friend for having left her at the party; she tried to apologize for 
leaving without saying anything, but she couldnt stop herself from 
bursting into tears. She was shaking uncontrollably and crying so she 
could hardly breathe, and she told her girlfriend that she had met this 
guy who had taken her to his apartment and wouldnt let her leave,
and there was no way that anyone would believe her, there was no 
evidence  he had let her take a shower  and even if there had 
been physical evidence there were no witnesses and she had not put 
up a struggle, nothing that could be called a struggle, anyway, 
despite her own constant struggle to think her way out of his reach, 
and she knew that if she brought charges against him he would 
know who had done it and he had already threatened her life ... she 
couldnt think of anything to do about it. She couldnt think of 
anything. There was nothing she could do. Nothing, was there? Was 
there anything she could do?
He called her a couple days later. He wanted to take her out. 
He said he was sorry if he had scared her, he was just so awkward 
around women, and he wanted to take her out and treat her to a nice 
dinner. He really liked her ... she was really nice, and he felt like he 
could talk to her. He wanted to spend more time with her, get to 
know her better. She thought she could explain to him that he 
shouldnt do what he had done to her, that it was okay to feel 
awkward, that women wouldnt necessarily refuse to have anything 
to do with him just because he felt awkward around the ones he 
liked. She told herself she wasnt condoning his actions, she wasnt 
taking responsibility for them, she was instead being responsible to 
his actions, doing something that she thought would prevent his 
behaving that way in the future. She didnt like him; how could she 
like him? She couldnt look at him without hearing him say If you 
embarrass me.... But she knew that there must be something wrong 
with him for him to do what he had done, and she wanted to try to 
set it right. She couldnt just do nothing, and that seemed like her 
only other option: she couldnt prosecute because there was no 
evidence, there were no witnesses, there was no struggle, no one 
would believe her, and if he got off  and she was convinced he 
would get off, and she was very probably right  then what would 
everyone think of her, and what else would he think of what he had 
done except that there was nothing really wrong with it? And how 
could she put herself through the ordeal of pressing charges, the 
ordeal of being questioned over and over again about her real 
motives, her real intentions, being asked to repeat over and over 
again in front of complete strangers what had happened, what she 
had felt, what he had done to her, how he had touched her, how he 
had whispered in her ear, how he had kept his body pressed against 
hers and had sex with her and then gave her orange juice for 
breakfast? It would be so much easier to try to talk to him, reason 
with hirn, try to make him see that what he had done was wrong, it 
was just wrong, and he should never do it again, should never have 
done it in the first place. So she went with him to dinner; and later, 
whenever anyone encouraged her to press charges, they would 
always ask if she had had any contact with him after the incident, 
and when she said yes and started to explain, their faces would fall 
and they would say, Oh ... well, Im afraid that changes things. 
And she knew then that there was no right thing for her to do, no 
way for any kind of justice to come out of this, and that she would 
just have to live with it. She would just have to live with knowing 
that it could happen again, to her, to someone else, and she would 
have to live with knowing that if it happened again, you only had 
two options: you could press charges and be systematically 
humiliated in court and take the risk (another risk!) of seeing the 
guy get off after... after embarrassing him, or you could just let it 
go, just avoid the guy, try to forget about it, so that if it happened 
again to you, to someone else, there was nothing to do but just learn 
all over again to just keep on living with it until it happened all over 
again, to you, to someone else....

Drood provides fun for everyone at Carnival
By BRENDAN McFEELY
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Over the weekend, Scotch n Soda put 
on its traditional Spring Carnival per
formance. Instead of performing an origi
nal play, as they did last year with 
Jack!, and the year before, with 
dArtegan: A Requiem, the group de
cided to tap into Broadway with a per
formance of the Rupert Holmes musical, 
The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Sopho
more directing major KristieAnne Reed 
directed the student production which 
was put on in Skibo Ballroom on Thurs
day, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday 
nights.
Drood, loosely based upon an unfin
ished novel begun by Charles Dickens 
shortly before his death, is really a playwithin-a-play. The Scotch n Soda play
ers take the parts of members ofLondons 
Music Hall Royale, who in turn perform 
the parts ofthe characters ofthe Dickens 
story. The play is gimmicky, as a result, 
with cast-members circulating through 
the audience at various parts of the 
action, reinforcing the idea that the 
crowd is actually sitting in a music hall
in Victorian England. In keeping with 
the gimmick, Skibo Ballroom was trans
formed into the Music Hall Royale, com
plete with an orchestra pit on the side of 
the stage.
To help with the illusion, the audience 
was encouraged by the players to heckle 
the villain, John Jasper (played by 
sophopmore information systems major 
J eff Kunins), and to cheer theheroofthe 
piece, Edwin Drood (sophomore LCS 
major Vivien Weiss). One section of 
Friday nights audience sang Hey 
Drood to the tune of The Beatles Hey 
Jude each time Weiss walked on stage. 
This effort at encouraging audience par
ticipation was appreciated, but seemed 
to drag a bit, as it went on for approxi
mately 15 minutes before the perfor
mance reached the point at which the 
plot began to move forward. Not that 
theres much of a plot to be had in this 
story, considering Dickens untimely 
demise.
The biggest gimmick of the night was 
based on this lack of plot, however. 
Holmes, who penned the play, put to
gether the idea of making the end con
tingent on the wishes of the audience.
Each audience member was able to vote 
on three crucial plot elements  who 
actually killed Edwin Drood, who is re
ally behind the disguise of the mysteri
ous bearded detective 
Dick Datchery, and 
which two characters 
will fall in love at the 
plays end. This par
ticular gimmick truly 
entertained themostof 
all. Unfortunately, the 
audience had to wait 
through the entire rest 
of the play, and much 
useless plot develop
ment, to reach this en
tertaining 20 minute 
laugh-fest. Though the 
performance is fre
quently broken up with 
musical numbers, they 
were somewhat lack
luster, and seemed as 
though they should have been subordi
nated to the much more entertaining 
audience particiption, or at least to the 
silliness of the Music Hall Royale play
ers. In fact, the musical number that
entertained most was the only one that 
had to do with the company itself the 
world-renowned Music Hall Royale ver
sion of Off to the Races, which was the

most active andinterestingofthe bunch.
The individual performances were en
tertaining, as usual for Scotch n Soda. 
However, the show was clearly stolen by 
junior political science major Dawn 
Nebelkopf in her role as 
Helena Landless, a ward 
ofthe Reverend Crisparkle 
(freshman policy and man
agement major Mike 
Keating). Nebelkopf s out
rageous accent and delib
erate hamming of her role 
made for great comedy in 
the midst of what turned 
out to be dull production 
numbers.
Also entertaining were 
junior social history major 
Christy M. Moore and 
Jared Oberhaus, junior 
computer engineering ma
jor. Moore, in her heavily 
made-up role of the Prin
cess Puffer, an opium-den 
owner, brought laughter 
to the audience on more 
than one occasion as she 
shambled across stage in
the guise of a broken-down nanny-cumdrug-dealer. Oberhaus entertained 
equally in his dual role of Bazzard. His 
scripted overacting made for quite a few 
amusing moments.
The lead parts of Edwin Drood, John 
Jaspers, and Droods fiance Rosa Bud 
were also well-played. Particularly good 
was CIT freshman Jessica Messer in the 
role of Rosa Bud. Messers singing voice 
handily eclipsed those of many of the 
other performers and made her musical 
numbers work.
Junior chemistry major Andy Folmer 
made for some pained audience groans 
as he punned his way through the role of 
the Chairman of the Music Hall Royale.
The orchestra sounded practiced, and 
was directed handily by senior math/CS 
major Michael Patrick Walker to good 
effect during the shows musical num
bers and incidental music.
Costumes, designed by sophomore 
design major Rachele Careon, capturod 
the flavor of the Victorian period well, 
and looked authontic.
Also on the production side, the chore
ography also appeared well-done. Cho
reographer Kolleigh Greenberg must 
have worked hard to coordinate some of 
the larger dancing numbers, and prob
ably equally hard on the spooky opium 
don hallucination scone, in which tho 
character of Jasper sees a shade of him
self throttle and kill a shade of Drood. 
During the hallucination, Jasper is boset by three female succubao, played by 
freshmen Stacey Gabor, Alyssa 
McCunney, and Lynn Pausic, who dance 
hauntingly and erotically around a 
dimly-lit stage.
On the whole, Scotch 'n' Soda made an 
entertaining attempt at capturing the 
mood of the Victorian music hall, and, to 
some extent, succeeded.
Its unfortunate that they were 
saddled with what is in spots a slowmoving script with a dearth of plot. 
However, the performance was still en
tertaining, and is yet another endorse
ment of the need on campus for inter
ested non-dramats to participate in stage 
work.

L14The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  19 April 1993
By JENNIFER TURNER
Tartan Staffwriter
Over the three days of Spring Carni
val 1993, the Carnival Committee along 
with Activities Board (AB) and the Stu
dent Dormitory Council (SDC) sponsored 
a plethora of activities for studentB. 
Amongthese activities were three come
dians who left the audience laughing, 
and another who, even with the inclem
ent weather, just made the audience 
leave.
Friday night, the first comedian on 
the agenda was Taylor Mason. This ver
satile comic entertained us with song, 
ventriloquism, and side-splitting com
edy. He started off the evening by thankingWheres the Band?, the musical act 
which preceded him, for the introduc
tion. He then went on to comment on 
everything from college (how the book
store rips students off) to sports (war in 
the Middle East should be replaced by 
the Middle East Basketball Champion
ships).
Between moments of commentary, he 
sang about a wide range of topics while 
accompanying himself on the keyboard. 
In his songs, he celebrated big hair 
(E=mc2 actually means elevation= 
mousse x conditioner), did rock and rap 
star impersonations (R.E.M., Bob Dylan, 
Sir Mixalot, and LL Cool J, to name a 
few), and sang a song dedicated to Presi
dent Clinton (is that Hillary or Bill?)
But the highlight of the act was the 
ventriloquism. Romeo (Mason'B dummy) 
cracked us up with his raging hormones 
(do dummies have hormones?), taleB of 
his other jobs (one of them as a dummy 
at Walt Disney World), and his devilmay-care attitude. Later in the act, Juliet 
was introduced and Mason concluded 
the act with a song done by the trio  
quite an amazing feat.
Next on the lino-up was David Cross. 
I only neod ono word to describe this act: 
Bad. Actually, I may need more words 
than that. Terrible, horrible. Ho crashed 
and burned, and no wonder. He started 
out with an imitation of ventriloquism 
and tho show went downhill from there. 
(But at least ho had an introduction.)
In an attempt to got people to stay, he 
gave away IVee beer and whined to the 
audience that ho was bombing (and in a 
big way). He got very few laughs, and 
when they did come, it was out of pity for
a guy who was on stage dying. By the 
end of his act, the tent had emptied 
considerably.
Saturday night, the comedy took a 
turn for the better when A1 
Romero and Michel Lauziere 
showed up. These comedians 
almost made me forget about 
David Cross.
A1 Romero came on first and 
regaled us with stories about 
being a Cuban in Miami and 
the culture shock he experi
enced when he moved to New 
York. He then slammed on 
several different ethnic 
groups. But his saving grace 
was his theory that deep down, 
everyone is the same because 
we all do the same stupid 
things (like pushing the but
ton on elevators even though theyre 
already lit up).
Another thing, Romero commented, 
that makes us all alike is that the same 
things piss everyone off: Jehovahs Wit
nesses, Hare Krishnas and bathroom 
attendants. Romero ended his act with 
an impression of John Wayne, in Spanwho described his act as novelty com
edy. Like Taylor Mason, much of his act 
was accompanied by music, some of it 
supplied by Lauziere, but most of it

prepared. His first act was to play a set 
of glasses  everything from wine 
glasses to the water glass to the brandy 
snifter.
The glasses were just the beginning. 
Throughout his act, Lauziere played a 
myriad ofhomemade instruments: a saw 
(Only You), an air pump (The Star 
Spangled Banner), and bells 
attached all over his body 
(Oh, Susannah).
Intermingled with his mu
sical feats were quick draw
ings of Charlie Chaplin, 
Albert Einstein, and the 
Pope. He also juggled, per
formed acrobatic tricks, and 
showed the audience how to 
be a quick-change artist by 
changing his pants in 1 sec
ond (even though it took him 
several minutes to prepare 
to take his pants off).
Lauziere ended bis act by 
stepping into a giant balloon 
he had just blown up and 
showing off his antics.
On the whole, the entire 
comedy slate waB at the very 
least enjoyable, and some
times hysterically funny 
(with one notable exception). 
The Spring Carnival Com
mittee, AB, and SDC did an
admirable job booking the coish. medians this year.

This years Carnival comedy acts provide beer for 
some, laughs for others
Clockwork and Reality Optional 
perform for Carnival crowd
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Amidst the howling winds and rain of 
a promising sunny day gone sour, CMU 
students piled into the tent last Thurs
day in hopes of finding shelter and some 
high-class entertainment.
They were not disappointed on either 
count. Although the tent pattered with 
rain and contorted flappily in the wind, 
it held firm; and though the entertain
ment was beset by delays and technical 
problems, it dished out plentiful amuse
ment for the audience.
Doled up in pinstripes and debonair 
grins, Jack Kalvan and Rick Rubenstein
 a.k.a. Clockworkinvoked laughter 
and applause with a combination of astoundingjuggling and affable showman
ship. Both CMU alums tossed their de
grees to the proverbial wind to become 
professional jugglers. Kalvan and 
Rubenstein shared their traveling show 
with the appreciative crowd.
The obvious task of jugglers is to dis
tinguish themselves from the nation
wide mob of troubadors doing essen
tially the same thing. Clockwork suc
ceeded not only with impressive techni
cal skill, but a series of memorable cre
ative antics.
There was of course the typical acro
batic shenanigans with balls and such, 
but it was the interactive element of the
show that really kept the audience on its 
toes. Rubensteinledablushinggirl from 
the audience onstage to pose for a live 
drawing - scribbled in frenzied bursts 
while the artist was simultaneously en
gaged in a three-pin toss with his part
ner. At a later juncture, another audi
ence member assumed a rigidly vertical 
stance while a stream of pins flew by on 
either side of him.
Another high was a marvelously cho
reographed segment where the two jug
glers stacked, tossed, piled, and rear
ranged a collection of flower pots with 
perfect synchronization to the music. By 
far the most technically impressive mo
ment was Kalvans harrowing stunt on a 
six-foot unicycle, where he not only 
juggled, but skewered an airborne apple 
on a knife which was clenched in his 
mouth.
The act was unfortunately riddled with 
screwups that were frequent enough so 
as to be distracting. However, even from 
these, Clockwork returned with good 
grace  sometimes feigning their blun
ders to be part of the act. And, of course, 
there was Rubensteins constant re
minder:
However much trouble we have dur
ing this routine, its still a lot better than 
you could do. True enough!

the music complimented and 
enriched Shakespeares words, 
there was no pretense, only an 
authentic appreciation of the 
words of a great writer.
I dont know how popular

serve some recognition.

The Little Wretches
The Little Wretches began 
promptly at seven, wearing(as 
was every band on the comer 
stage) their coats. The usual 
assortment of Wretches fans 
were there and a decent num
ber of CMU students, but more 
Pitt students showed up to 
hear them play than you fairweather fans. Pitt students. 
Man.
As the band played, some 
alumni stopped and bobbed 
their heads for a while until 
their children came out of the 
booths and join them. They 
left with a satisfied and curi
ous look on their faces.
Their performance was an
nounced in the Weekend sec
tion of Fridays Post-Gazette, 
callingthem Pittsburghs most 
lyric-heavy and hard rockin 
band. Or something like that.
They lived up to every word. 
A group of people came up to 
the band with more requests 
than their time would permit, 
so the band did a private show 
beside the stage in the dark 
for them. And thats one of the 
reasons why I think they are 
among Pittsburghs best and 
brightest bands. And just be
cause theyre from Pittsburgh 
doesnt make them an REOSpeedwagon Yinzer band.
For those of you who missed 
the show, you can check them 
out this Friday night at the 
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern 
where theyll be playing with 
Ploughmans Lunch. Or you 
can see them on May 7 at 
Lucianos Coffeehouse down 
by Duquesne.
In closing, Id just like to say 
that people try too hard to be 
cool. We even choose our lov
ers based on what is accept
able and happening. I see too 
much of that in the music 
around here. Open your own

structured scenarios for their make-it-up-as-we-go antics, and Real
ity Optionals were very well crafted. During an emotional con
certo, the members each hammed up a different emotional state 
suggested by the audience, rising and falling in intensity according 
to the direction of an onstage conductor. In another segment, the 
group improvised an ongoing drama that changed genre in mid
stream, from Shakespearean drama to a Godzilla movie.
But despite short bursts of amusement, nothing really took off. 
The jokes seemed forced and contrived; the actors didnt achieve that 
resonant synergy that lets good improv really soar into hilarity. And 
a few potentially hysterical opportunities (e.g. an Ashman-andMenkin Disney musical about sheep herding) just fell flat. Reality 
Optional is a talented group, but they clearly had an off night.
Nonetheless, both groups were well-received amidst the wild 
enthusiasm of a cheering crowd. Whatever the nature of a show, 
there was almost a free bonus of extra excitementthis was, after 
all, Carnival.

HEAD
(from a poem by Norman Mailer)
Wlml find happened was this:
I watched two mrn come, over the ridge. 
When their uniforms became visible, I 
approached and helped them through die 
Imrbed wire. The sky was eold and had 
(unit'd a milky gray from ash and din and 
hits oi flesh that the buttles lore up and threw 
skyward.
I was twenty-four at the lime and made 
lonely ami strange by the dark earth of 
Kaslem Kuro|>e, the thick muddy land of 
1 M3.
They were British ami only a few years 
older than I. but I heir eyes were tainted and 
had the vacant look of l>cdriddcn old men. 
Their skin was hard, like painted stone, and 
looked like ii alone could deter bullets.
I was then; lo make a short filma 
documentary dial Dr. Rudowski, my menior, 
said would help free my work of its increased 
glib and self-indulgent nature. At the 
Institute., they wanted everything to be kept 
simple and enjoyable for all. I understood my 
mentor's sentiments, and despite being 
headstrong and young, iried to work on tin; 
problem.
There were four others beside myself, all 
graduates of the institute and all students or 
Dr. Uudowski. The director had been killed 
by a piece of shrapnel dial had become lodged 
in hi* ribeage. In die same attack that look his 
life, I had been separated from the rest of the 
crew. After two weeks, I was only able to 
locate a broken tripod leg. 'Hie crew was 
either de-ad or taken captive. I had evidence of 
neither.
i retained die Bolex camera, light meter, 
and four hundred feel of film. All this 
equipment I secured in a black case with a 
strap that I wore over my shoulder. Two of 
the three lenses I had started the project with 
were cracked and the third had compressed 
and been thrown slightly out of focus from 
prolonged exposure to the cold temperature. It 
was this third lens that I kept fixed to the 
camera.
We walked for over an hour. Our bools 
were covered in brown muck and made a
sucking sound with each step. They told me I 
could speak with their Lieutenant. I It; would 
be able lo determine if I could establish 
contnet with American forces.
We stopped walking and for several 
minutes watched a crow |>eek tit a broken jaw 
bone. The pink gum was still slick and moist 
and the teeth were very white and clean; it 
made me wonder what my own teeth looked 
like., since I had not brushed them in over a 
month.
Why dont you film thut? die soldiers 
asked.
I thought what Dr. Uudowski had said 
and shook my head.
Why not? It is interesting. Very visual, 
they said and nodded. One of them gestured 
in die direction or die bird and raised his 
eyebrows a little.
I o|>cncd up the black case and pulled 
out the equipment.
I checked the threading on the camera 
and iried to adjust the diopter lo correct for 
the (law in the lens. The aberration appeared 
worse iban the last lime I looked through the 
eyepiece. My lingers ached in the cold air.
I heard the flutter of wings over my head.
Too lute, one or them said.
W e kept walking unlil suddenly u 
machine gun sounded. I look to my knees 
when I felt mud spatter on my check. The Lwo 
soldiers did not flinch. 'Hie blast seemed lo 
emanate from a great distance and had u 
slight echo that I recognized.
When I looked up I saw that one or the 
men was missing his head.
This happens sometimes, the other one 
said, We have lo keep him moving.
I le look him under one arm and the two 
(>r them Iw.gun to walk fnrward.
Hut, wail can
There is a doctor up ahead, the soldier 
with the head said, Over the next set of 
trenches and across the wheal Held.
I held die black cusc close to my side and 
followed.
As we walked, I saw that flecks or blood
got onto the sleeve or my heavy wool coal and 
were growing darker as they l>eeume absorbed 
by the thick fabric.
We kept walking until we saw his lieud 
on the ground.
'Hie temptation was more than I could 
withstand. The hell with Dr. Uudowski, I 
thought.
(!un I film this? I asked.
Kilm what? the one with the head 
asked.
This," I said. I lim. Standing. Walking.
I lis head over there on die ground.
Ok. Bui. I>e quick about ii. We havent 
got much lime, he said. Already I could see 
die headless TomTC begin lo slump lo one side.
I poiriied die camcra ill a tree in die 
distance and turned die diopter ring, h had 
grown sliff in die cold.
I lurry, I he soldier said.
Okay, okay, I said. One more 
minute.
'Hie melal ring gave slighlly. I twisted it 
to the furthest end of fucus. then back, but die 
image or the tree remained blurred. I (minted 
the camera at die ground and iried a shorter 
r<>cal distance. 'I bis loo was unnimahlc.
I lurry. Tor Christ sake! 
The body was slipping away bom him. 
The soldier hem at the knees and, keeping 
one arm hooked l>encalh the headless body, 
iried 10 shift its weight onto his shoulder.
I tried to unscrew ihe lens from die 
mount sockci and when lhai didnt work, 
tried to re-adjust the focusing ring. But no 
mailer wliai I did, I could not gel the lens in 
fricus properly.
'Ilicre was a moan from die thick mud. 
The soldier and I hoili looked down.
My Cod. Im dead, the head on the 
ground said.
And then die I^^I< Tell over.

in that Something
Crowning 
like an old woman in pain, it falls 
ungracefully.
Spins and flaps to the ground.
It does not bounce.
It crunches
straight through the dry weeds 
and tall grass.
I feel 
the exciting pitch 
in my stomach, 
the power of a rifle.
And when I finally 
see it 
a shapeless black stain 
and flip it over 
with my foot, I realize 
that it's no big deal 
toasgtlL home empty-handed.

Drowned
MeadowWhen you look at your life, you have nothing 
but a splintered dock, mottled
weathered gray by hurricanes and gales, ripped slowly 
to its skeleton. You feel it under your 
bare thighs, reminding you of childhood 
regrets that drag through memories like tugs.
Mussels suck thick from below 
in sticky mud-tar, the bay quietly sealing 
in afterthoughts. You dive after them, 
your own hero, and find yourself 
taken to the middle of Conscience Bay, 
the sides of Setauket surrounding you 
like the insides of a womb. Your hair 
spreads around you for minnows to play 
jump rope and reeds brush your arms 
like the gentle pleas of parents and friends 
for you to come back, but you pay them no 
heed, continuing on to the shores of Drowned 
Meadow, dilapidated town you never 
understood. You recall the past, yours and 
its alone, and you know there is nothing.

Howard K. Soachnrsky 
Holnes Prooecoion Service 
1100 Indnsory Road 
Roseland, NJ 09054
Mr. Soachnrsky:
Thongh I have ohoronghly enjoyed working for ohe Holmes Prooecoion Service over ohe paso five years, I 
regreo oo reqneso here, ohao yon oo accepo ray resignaoion. I feel I mnso explain ao lengoh ohe reasons behind my 
wiohdrawal, as io mnso seem sndden oo yon and ohe reso of my colleagnes. Fnroher, I wonld like oo reqneso ohao 
my benefios be fnlly insoaoed dne oo ohe naonre of my grievances.
Leo me begin by soaoing ohao I ohink yon rnn a fine company, and ohis acoion has noohing oo do wioh ohe
adminisoraoion, or my relaoions wioh yonrself or my snperiors. In faco, nay I say ohao ohe people I have had a 
chance oo work wioh dnring ohe paso five years have been oop raoe, many of whom I consider close friends. I find
io nnforonnaoe ohao yon and I have noo been able oo keep in close conoaco, ohongh I know ohao ohe naonre of yonr
work keeps yon bnsy and ohao an open rapporo wonld be difficnlo oo mainoain. We're all paro of a oeam, and 
everyone needs oo do oheir respecoive job; I nndersoand ohis compleoely. I have been ohoronghly impressed, if I 
may say, wioh ohe way ohe conpany has grown dnring my five year soay wioh Holnes Prooecoion.
There cones a oine in all onr lives when we have oo soep onoside onrselves and ask, "Whao is io ohao I'm
doing now? Am I happy wioh where my life is going?" Yon know ohis soro of ohing, a realioy check. Being a
nigho secnrioy officer provides ne wioh ample oire oo ohink abono ohese naooers. Mind yon, I have always been 
aooenoive oo my job. I believe ohao my record is clean and wiohono incideno.
I snppose ohao sone in adminisoraoion nay look ao a paroicnlar occasion when I was assigned oo Enoerprise 
Daoa Sysoems wioh scmswhao of a snspicions eye, bno I don'o ohink ohe occasion had any lasoing inpaco or damage 
oo my record. I did noo realize ohao I was being videooaped ao ohe oine, and even if I did realize io, I wonld 
noo have ohongho ohao ohese oapes wonld be reviewed. I mean, whao are ohe chances of ohe secnrioy oapes being
reviewed on a ronoine nigho on ohe waoch? Bno I snppose ohao is paro of yonr job, and mine is noo oo qnesoion
why.
Leo ne jnso explain abono ohao occasion, if io does have any bearing oo yon npon my characoer. Secnrioy 
work is a lonely bnsiness. Yonr honrs, Mr. Soachnrsky, are regnlarly schednled dnring ohe week, ohe nine oo five 
oype, wioh ohe weekends off. Me, well any secnrioy officer knows going inoo ohe profession ohao ohe honrs are 
ofoen crazy. Weekends are almoso always on ohe bill, and my paroicnlar assignmenos have been generally nigho 
work.
mnforonnaoely, whao happens is ohao I lose my nigholy free oime and I sleep mosoly dnring ohe day. Believe 
ne sir, I am noo filing any conplaino abono my work, I loved ohe job from day one. Bno ohe faco of ohe naooer 
is, I really didn'o geo a chance oo geo ono mnch, and wiohono geooing inoo ohe ngly deoails of ohe incideno, leo 
ne jnso say ohao I hadn'o even seen a woman in a long, long oine. Lioerally, I hadn'o even seen one. Cne oends 
oo leo his hands wander sone nighos considering ohao faco. Io's lonely ono ohere in secnrioy work, Mr.
Soachnrsky.
As I soaoed before, I don'o ohink ohao ohis incideno has any bearing on my long oerm record, bno I wanoed oo 
clear io np if io was in yonr mind in ohe slighoeso.
Now ohao I've goo ohe air cleared, allow ne oo explain sone of ohe ooher deoails snrronnding whao mnso seem 
oo be a mysoerions wiohdrawal by myself.
As yon know, a secnrioy officer has a loo of oine on his hands. Time on yonr hands, is oime on yonr mind. 
Mr. Soachnrsky, ohe Devil preys npon ohe idle mind. In my darkeso nighos, over ohe paso several monohs, I began 
oo form deep obsessions whidi encanpassed all of my honrs.
Leo ne relaoe oo yon one paroicnlar example which will illnsoraoe my poino.
Sone weeks ago, on a nigho ohao had been as qnieo as any ooher nigho, I had sone sorange ohings happen oo

---------------------------------------------------

me. I had done ohe ronoine secnrioy checks aronnd ohe bnildings, and enoered my nooes in ohe log book. This was
when I was working np ao Fidelioy Firso offices in Cream Ridge. The bnilding was noohing complicaoed, a ronoine
soro of job for any secnrioy officer. The only paro I conld really menoion was ohao ohe secnrioy boooh ioself 
was smaller ohan anyohing I had previonsly experienced. Moso places give yon enongh room oo relax, oo bring a 
few of yonr own ohings, oo make io inoo a personal space. Afoer all, an officer spends abono as mnch oine in 
ohao boooh as any fnll oime secreoary or execnoive for ohao naooer. If yon're on a long soay ao ohe job, ohey 
nsnally provide yon wioh some room. I mean, ohao boooh becomes yonr heme away from heme afoer awhile. Noo ohao 
I had ooo mnch oo bring anyway. As yon probably know, I am noo married and I have no kids. Who wonld wano oo 
marry someone who is always ono all nigho, and sleeps dnring ohe day? A vanpire maybe. My lifesoyle wonld be a 
nighomare for any yonng female whan I migho oake for a wife. I believe whole hearoedly ohao I am being mercifnl 
oo ohe ladies in soaying single. Anyway, I don'o have piconres oo bring or paperweighos from kids, or silly 
lioole gadgeo ooys (ohao is noo oo say I wonldn'o enjoy ohese ohings, I ohink yon shonld know, I am a family nan 
ao hearo). All I really expeco is room for a book or owo, a comforoable chair, maybe a lioole comer for a small 
oelevision seo. Noo ohao I waoch ooo mnch TV.
This place was really nnbearable come oo ohink of io. I meano oo menoion io oo yon, bno I felo ohao I conld 
deal wioh ohe sionaoion on my own. As yon know, afoer we make ohe regnlar ronnds, we are snpposed oo remain ao 
ohe desk, as we were insorncoed in ohe oraining sessions. Noo one oo break ohe rnles, I sao ao ohe desk for as 
long as I conld bear.
Mr. Soachnrsky, I'm snre ohe desk yon sio ao righo now is noo overbearing. Io probably has enongh room for
yon oo seoole all ohe affairs ohao cross yonr desk every day, inclnding ohis one. Yon prohably have a conple of
phooos of yonr lovely wife and kids, maybe a name plaoe, a nice oypewrioer or compnoer, maybe sans acconno files. 
I'm snre io is noohing ooo exoraordinary, bno io is enongh, righo? Io does ohe job wiohono crowding yonr office.
Consider ohao my office is ohe enoire bnilding ao Firso Fidelioy Invesomenos and my desk, ohe place where I 
do moso of my work, is no longer ohan an ordinary card oable and no wider ohan a folded newspaper. The monioors 
are monnoed on oop of ohe one snail shelf, and ohere is a snail orash can nnderneaoh, bno no drawers oo hold any
ohing I need oo ohrow away!
The chair, well io wonld be downrigho inoeresoing oo compare io oo yonr chair. Yon are a wise adminisora
oor, and I'm snre ohao yon pnrchased yonr office fnrnionre wioh frngalioy and prndence. I'm snre ohao yonr 
chair is comforoable enongh so ohao yon can pno in an honeso days work wiohono snffering any ill physical side 
effecos. Maybe io reclines, has a padded seao, maybe yon can adjnso ohe heigho a lioole, or io has wheels when 
yon need oo go oo ohe filing cabineo.
Mr. Soachnrsky, I oell yon ohao ohe chair ao ohe Firso Fidelioy bnilding was no bigger ohan an infano's high 
chair. Yon know ohe kind, I remember yon saying yon had ohree children ao ohe Chrisomas paroy laso year. My 
arms hnng off ohe sides oerribly. I wonld geo off work wioh ohe moso horrific lack aches. I know io is noo com
pany policy oo complain abono ohe facilioies as io is noo good for cnsoomer relaoions. Thao is why I neglecoed
oo oell yon abono ohese problems. I fignred I conld bear wioh io for awhile, ohao maybe ohey were in ohe middle
of geooing new fnrnionre. I ohongho of bringing my own chair, bno I feared ohao an execnoive from Firso Fidelioy 
migho find io insnloing if ohey saw oheir good money being wasoed on a chair noo in nse. I did my beso oo cope, 
Mr. Soachnrsky.
I've had my share of sionaoions in my life; we all have. I've done ohe beso I conld oo adjnso. I mean, 
soaroing ono in ohe nigho secnrioy profession was no cakewalk. I remember nomings ccming hane, blood-shoo eyes 
and wondering if I conld make io ohe nexo day. The people over ao ohe Dnnkin Donnos when I nsed oo work in 
Somerseo nsed oo call me ohe "Zombie Man." I knew ohao ohe job wonld oeso my paoience and endnrance, as well as
my physical sorengoh and aleroness. I am soill in prime condioion or ao leaso I was for ohe majorioy of my oerm
wioh Holmes Prooecoion.
Cranped qnaroers are a nan's worso nighomare. Clansorophobic condioions are noo means of good roenoal and ' 
physical preparedness. I haven'o admiooed ohis oo anyone as of yeo, Mr. Soachnrsky, bno I feel all of yon people 
miso know.
As ohe space of ohe secnrioy desk began oo wear on my nerves, I began oo look ooward ooher acoivioies oo 
keep myself away from ohao reprehensible chair. Io is difficnlo for me oo admio ohis, becanse I broke one of ohe 
cardinal rnles in secnrioy work. . *
I became obsessive abono dismanoling and rebnilding my sidearm. I wonld bring oools oo work and kneel on 
ohe floor oo oake my weapon aparo. I cleaned each piece ohoronghly and several oimes. I began organizing ohe 
pieces of ohe oile floor. Every nigho I wonld creaoe differeno designs wioh ohe pieces of ohe gnn. .1 wonld

---------------------------------------------------

arrange linear paooerns of screws and bnlleos. I oook ohe body aparo and laid each side of ohe wooden hanc^oiece 
opposioe each ooher nexo oo ohe bnlleos. I wonld place ohe barrel so ohao io creaoed a soraigho line across ohe 
oop of ohe design. If any armsd inornder enoered ohe bnilding, I wonld have been wiohono defense.
In a single nigho, I conld have ohe gnn dismanoled and rebnilo ohree or fonr oines, inclnding ohe consornc
oion of ohe inoricaoe design paooerns.
This sionaoion goo worse recenoly. Believe me Mr. Soachnrsky, ohis is a moso difficnlo oask, oelling yon 
ohis, since my record has been so clear np nnoil now.
I don'o know exacoly whao came over nre, bno I felo ohe nrge oo creaoe more complicaoed designs. I disrobed, 
and all of my cloohes and eqnipieno became paro of ohe ohe designs. They were qnioe beanoifnl, I migho add, I 
didn'o know I had ohao creaoive spirio in me. I nsed my nniform as a body, and creaoed a head and appendages 
wioh ohe paros of my gnn, my belo, nighosoick, and handcnffs. The bnlleos were arranged in a smiling face, ohen 
a frowning face, and on and on inoo ohe nigho.
I consorncoed ohe flowers I remember seeing when I was a boy. The flowers one wonld see near brooks and 
soreams in deep woods. I remember seeing ohe flowers when I weno fishing behind my honse down in Vineland. A 
cnrions sigho io was, flowers made of bnlleos and screws!
I was very calm abono ohe whole ohing. I assnre yon ohao never once did an employee from Firso Fidelioy 
caoch ms in ohis moso conprcmising posioion. Imagine me, a veoeran officer, kneeling soark naked on ohe floor, 
wioh a silly paooern of gear in frono of me! I'm snre yon find ohe image qnioe amnsing. Looking back on io now, 
I realize how silly I mnso have looked.
To make ohe sordid soory more brief, ohe difficnloy I was having cane oo a head, I believe io was ohree 
nighos ago. Yon see, np nnoil ohao nigho, I did noo find ny behavior oo be problemaoic. I wonld go heme in ohe 
mornings fnlly cloohed and wioh my weapon inoaco, almoso as if I had compleoely forgoooen abono ohe previons 
nigho's evenos. Io was as if I was oooally cleansed of my worries ohe very moieno I soepped ono ohe frono door.
I probably wonld soill be going on had I noo ohongho oo nse ohao blasoed chair in my nigholy procednre. I 
had a new vision seo np, wioh all ny eqnipmeno and cloohes forming a spiral aronnd ohe chair, wioh ohe chair as
ohe cenoerpiece of ohe design. I was orying oo achieve scmeohing cosmic. As I placed ohe laso bnlleo on ohe
floor, I becane painfnlly self aware on my hands and knees as I looked np ao ohe chair wioh chilling rnshes of 
rage. The chair had embarrassed me oo myself, yon see. I saw ny nakedness. I qnickly cloohed and began oo
rebnild my weapon. I clenched my oeeoh while I was doing ohis, as I can soill feel ohe sorain on my jaw. I
replaced ohe laso few screws wioh ohe reckless abandon of a madman. When ohe gnn was operaoional once again, 
and all ohe bnlleos in ohe chamber, I discharged ohe weapon inoo ohe chair, and desoroyed io beyond all recogni
oion.
I' 11 oell yon Mr. Soachnrsky, pieces of wood were everywhere, bno I ejq^erienced an enormons feeling of 
relief knowing ohao ohe chair was no more. Believe me, ohis whole scenario is qnioe embarrassing oo oell, I
realize only now ohao ohe relief I felo was oransieno and jnvenile. Anyway, I oook care oo clean np ohe msss,^ .
and dispose of ohe reorains of ohe chair fnlly, so ohao no one from ohe Fidelioy bnilding wonld nooice anyohing,
