ELECTION OF TWO ASSISTANT BASE BALL MANAGERS
Several weeks ago the Board of Control made an 
effort to stir up more interest in Athletics by giving 
the student body the right to elect assistant base
ball managers.
Lest the regulation, which was passed by the Board 
of Controlto enable holding the electionbe mis
understood, some explanation will be given here of 
what this regulation means.
In most of the larger colleges a call is issued at 
a certain period of the school year for candidates 
for tne position of assistant baseball manager. 
These men are usually from the Junior Class, since 
they are men who have already spent two years at 
college, and understand more about the athletics and 
athletic standing of their college. Moreover these 
men are such as are willing to come forward and 
will say that they are candidates for the position. 
From these candidates who present themselves, a 
certain number are selected by the Managing Board 
of Athletics. These men are then presented before 
the student body for election. In this election only
upper class men know enough about the candidates 
to. be able to cast an intelligent vote.
Such an election our Board of Control had in view 
when they asked for candidates for the position of 
assistant baseball manager. Yet, at the meeting of 
the Board of Control, held on February 16, not one 
candidate was present to offer himself to the board 
for consideration for this position. Does this mean 
that there are no men in the Junior Classes who 
want this position, or who do not consider it an 
honor to be elected assistant baseball manager? It 
is hoped that this is not the case, and only due to 
some misunderstanding.
At the last meeting of the Board a motion was 
passed to postpone any action on this matter until 
the next meeting, which will be held on March 2, 
when another opportunity will be given for men to 
present their names for this position.
If you are a candidate present your name to some 
member of the Board before March 2, who will in 
turn have your name brought up for consideration 
in that meeting.
WHITE FRIARSSHOW WELL ASSURED
At the trials of the White Friars held for the 
dancing and singing choruses last Tuesday after
noon, a much better showing of men were present, 
and for the first time since the first call for candi
dates, real interest was displayed. Last week Man
ager Mitchell went about the schools making ad
dresses to many of the classes, describing to the 
first year men what the White Friars are and how 
they came into existence, and if no more interest 
was taken in affairs, all the work of the preced
ing seasons would count for naught. As a result, 
enough men turned out to make it impossible to
fully try them all out at that one trial. The next 
meeting will take place on Saturday afternoon at 
2:30 in the A. & J. Assembly Hall. Since the de
cisions on the men out in the trials so far has to be 
postponed until Saturday, it has been decided to 
hold them open to new comers until that date. 
Both cast and choruses will be tried.
The last chance to get into the White Friar show 
of this year will be on Saturday afternoon.
Further arrangements for stage lighting have 
been made that will eclipse anything done before 
by the White Friars. Electrical effects are to be

one of the special points of excellence in this years 
production. A moonlight dance in phosphorized cos
tumes, and an electric fishpond will be excellent 
features.
Already business arrangements are well under 
way for the booking of the trip to be taken by the 
club : before the Pittsburgh' prformances.
PLEBE CLASS.
On February 1, 1910, the Plebe Class assembled in 
full for the election of Glass officers.
Professor Follows gave an interesting talk on the 
degenerating effect of clique rule. The result of 
the election showed that the Class had beenthink
ing alofag the same lines. The members of the 
Plebe Class had awakened to the fact that they have 
a responsibility in the elections.
After the transaction of considerable business the 
appointed judge of election took charge. Not be
ing able to hold the chair he deserted the post, and 
the following actions taken with another man in the 
chair were constitutionally void. Considerable in
terest was shown in the proceedings which were 
definitely settled by the regularly conducted meet
ing of Feb. 7. The following men were elected:
PresidentDornberger.

LECTURE ON STEEL MANUFACTURE.
A lecture of great interest to educators and tech
nical students of thePitsburgh district will be given 
in the Chemical lecture room, Engineering Building, 
Carnegie Technical Schools, Saturday evening, Feb
ruary 26th, by Professor Joseph W. Richards, Pro
fessor of Metallurgy at Lehigh University.
Professor Richards subject will be the Electric 
Furnace in Iron and Steel Manufacture, and his 
lecture will be illustrated with numerous lantern 
slides. He is one of the best lecturers on technical 
subjects in the country, and has made the applica
tions of the Electric Furnace his special study.
This lecture is of unusual interest here as the re
fining of steel by the Electric Furnace process is 
just beginning in this dictrict. All students and in
structors interested are invited to attend this lec
ture. 
A delegation of students from Carnegie Schools, 
Pittsburgh, Pa., under the direction of Mr. L. B. 
Smith, of the Department of Geology, spent Friday 
in studying the rock formations in and around Har
pers Ferry. The party was composed of Civil and 
Mining engineers, among them particular mention
should be made of Messrs. B. N. Mason and Wm. 
Wagner. The past week was spent between Wash
ington and the Ferry, many quarries and mines 
were visited and inspected and valuable specimens 
were obtained. A trip such as this, which brings 
the student into contact with the phenomena which 
he is studying, has a great practical value, and il
lustrates the aim of Carnegie Technical School. 
Harpers Ferry Times, Feb. 11, 1910.
CARENGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
The* Carnegie Mechanical Society held its monthly 
meeting in Machinery Hall Saturday night, February 
12th, and to say that there were large doings is put
ting it mildly. The meeting was one of the very best, 
from an intellectual and social standpoint that the 
Society has ever held. Those who attended in spite 
of the inclement weather were well repaid for their 
trouble, and the few faint hearted ones who feared 
to venture forth were punished enough by missing a 
very entertaining evening
The speaker of the .evening was Mr. Courtland S. 
Jones., M. E., instructor of rolling mill design in the 
schools. Mr. Jones gave a very interesting address 
on rolling mill and blast furnace work. He confined 
his talk to a, description of the plant of the Lacka
wanna Steel Co. at Buffalo, N. Y. He was connected 
with that concern for a considerable time, and took 
an active part in the construction work going on 
at the plant during his stay there. His description of 
this work was vividly illustrated by lantern views 
from about fifty or more photographs taken during 
the course of the work.
Starting with a general view" of the entire works, 
the $350,000 office building being well in the fore
ground, Mr. Jones explained their layout. He then 
showed a photograph of the breakwater erected by 
the company to provide a safe harbor for its ore 
ships. The views immediately following were fine il
lustrations of the methods used in unloading these 
ore carriers.
Some very interesting anecdotes wrere related con, 
cerning the Hullswitt unloaders in use at Lackawana. 
Mr. Jones contenntion that there is money in en
gineering if one gets in right, was well supported by 
his statement that Mi. Hullswitt gets two cents for 
every ton of ore taken from a vessel by his un
loaders. (Many slide rules were immediately in evi
dence around the room figuring out the profits on the 
basis of fourteen cents per bucket load of ore.)
Following this came views showing a large blast 
furnace during process of construction. This furnace 
is one of the largest of the Lackawana group, and 
as explained, it was erected in the shortest; time 
knowm in the annals of furnace construction. The 
ground for this furnace was broken September 12th, 
1905, and the first metal obtained February 11th, 
1906; just five months lacking one day for completion 
of work. )
After the lecture Mr. Jones was kept busy for sev
eral minutes answering questions. For some reason, 
probably the thought of the frigid weather prevailing

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN5
Ijfe V f ' 'ioutside, the stoves seemed to be the most interesting 
part of the furnace to those present, and many 
queries were put concerning them. The construct
ing and erecting methods also came in for a general 
discussion.
After Mr. Jones had completed his address, a short 
talk was delivered by Mr. Considine, a member of the 
society. His topic, The trials and tribulations of an 
erecting engineer was delivered in the quaint humor
ous manner for which he is famous. The hearty 
laughs that prevailed during the narration of his 
troubles put every one in good humor for the final 
treat of the eveningthe refreshments.
The refresment committee provided a generous lay
out, and the few unfortunates who did not come to 
the meeting missed a swell feed. Heres hoping that 
the same committee always stays on the job.
After refreshments had been served the regu
lar meeting of the society was held and the routine 
business transacted. Meeting was then adjourned. 
The next meeting will be held in Machinery Hall 
Saturday, March 12th, 1910. Announcement of speak
ers will appear later.
PITTSBURGH ARCHITECTURAL EXHIBIT.
The Pittsburgh Architectural Club will hold its fifth 
annual exhibition in the Carnegie Institute Galleries 
from March 1 to 17. The affair is national in its 
scope, and is the first to be held here in three years. 
The exhibit will consist of plan, section, elevation, 
and design. Landscape and decorative work will be 
a specialty, as well as stained glass, models, photo
graphs of erected work, sketches and paintings of 
decorative subjects and work in wood, bronze, 
wrought iron, mosaic, glass, leather and tapestry. 
The committee having the exhibit in charge consists 
of, J. T. Comes, E. W. Boyer, James Macqueen, E. B. 
Lee, and Edward J. Weber. It speaks well for the 
interest of Carnegie Tech when it will be noticed 
that the majority of this committee are Applied De
sign men.
DAY SCIENCE SOPHOMORES ELECT OFFICERS.
At a recent meeting of the Sophomore class of the 
School of Applied Science, the following men were 
elected as the officers of the class: President, Porter
field; vice president, Hecker; secretai'y, Koerbel; 
treasurer, Brown; class historian, Holiday.
THE CRAFTSMANS CLUB.
The Craftsmans Club held their second meeting 
of the month in their club rooms on the evening of 
Friday, Feb. 18. The quarters of the club were taxed 
to their utmost to hold the gathering. Twelve new 
men were admitted, which brings the total member
ship up to a half hundred. Jamisons motion, pro
viding for the closing of the charter of the club on 
March 4, will give the students of Classes B, C, and
D, another opportunity to join the Club without hav
ing to pay an initiation fee. The President and
Secretary elected at the recent meeting presided for 
the first time. A trip to some point of interest was 
discussed, with the result that the instrument works 
of Dr. John A. Brashear and the Observatory will 
likely be the places to which the pilgrimage will be 
taken. It will be remembered that some of the club 
took the same trip last year, and felt so well repaid 
for doing so that another at the present time will 
not be amiss. After transacting routine business 
the club adjourned to meet on March 4.
Senator Oliver was given a vot of thanks by the 
Club for placing its name on the mailing list of sev
eral Washington publications.

THE CLUB HOUSE.
The committee on the arranging of the Club House 
has ceased to exist by reason of its own non-activity. 
In thus deceasing itself, it is very evident there is 
no demand for such a thing. All of the schools have 
made provision for club rooms for their situdents, 
and a general one with nothing to serve as an at
traction, has not yet any place in our affairs.
There is no use riding the idea of a club house any 
ionger. There is need for an office building for the 
student activities of recognized standing, so why not 
make use of the building :n that manner?
NOTICE.
The students, day and night, are notified that 
after January 1st, 1910, Dr. w. B. Orbin, the Schools 
physician, will have office hours at the Schools daily 
from 12 oclock until 1.45 and on Monday, Wednes
day and Friday evenings from 7 to 7.30. Dr. Orbin 
will render free service to the students in the school 
office. His private office is located in the Forbes 
Building, Forbes and Atwood Streets, in which his 
office hours wTill be until 10 A. M., from 2 to 3 P. M., 
and from 7.30 to 8.30 P. M.Sunday until 11 A. M. 
Students treated at the private office or at their 
homes or boarding houses will do so at their own 
expense; Dr. Orbin, however, agrees to make a spe
cial rate to any student needing his services beyond 
that given in his office at the School Building prop

EDITORIAL
CRANE ON THE WAR-PATH AGAIN.
We learn from one of our contemporaries that our 
critic, the Honorable Richard T. Crane, of Chicago, 
who called our Schools Carnegies $13,000,000 blun
der, has had another eruption.. Going from the 
rather narrow field of our own Schools, he assumes 
the self-imposed task of making it plain to the edu
cated people of the country, how absolutely foolish 
is their college training. He has left us to smear up 
the college world in general. We have lost the ex
clusive privilege of being the bulls eye of his target.
In a book devoted to his hobby, the task of trying 
to tear down what it has taken centuries of labor to 
build up, he tells cf his careful investigation ol' 
higher education and how it is pulling the blankets 
off the beds of the people; taking the bread of toil 
out of their mouths; removing the pennies from the 
eyes of the dead; turning their gravestones into curb
ing; taking the cherry cut of their cocktails; remov
ing the olive oil from their lobster salad; stripping 
the imported tires from the wheels of their automo
biles; utterly ruining the dinner sets in their ban
quet halls, and playing havoc with the mural decora
tions on tneir steam yachts. It is all sobs and heart 
throbs. It makes you afraid to slip more than a 
nickel into the collection basket, and to clean your 
feet too vigorously on the doormat for fear of wear
ing holes in it.. The Honorable Mr. Crane put a brick
on the weepy pedal, and proceeded to play a bass 
drum solo on the rest of his imagaination.
It is a funny thing that the man who knows all 
about a college is the one who has never been any 
nearer than the back cellar door. From the present 
example, it also seems that the same variety is the 
most prone to proceed to tell it all. We do not ac
cuse the Honorable Mr. Crane of being a muckraker, but he possesses the qualities to make a hum
mer.
If we tried to tell him how to quote prices on 
steam fittings, he would say we were crazy or some
thing stronger. Since the reverse is the case; we 
have to remember *he culture that our college train
ing brings us, and say he is quite mistaken. But cul
tured talk does not express our sentiments.
BASKET BALL TROUBLE.
During the past week, Dr. Savage, the Athletic Di
rector, sent out letters to the members of a basket 
ball team composed of students who have been play
ing games throughout the season. It was reported 
by papers in nearly all of the towns in which the 
team played, that it was the Carnegie Tech Varsity 
team that had come to play their High School. Upon 
investigation, it has been learned that none of the 
members of the team or their manager were in the 
least responsible for the misrepresentation. A few 
papers have been so blind as to print notices of these 
games as having taken place between the Varsity 
team and that of some High Schoolblind for the 
fact that Varsity basket ball was dropped for the 
year by the Board of Control in September, and that 
no school the size of this would schedule any such 
games.. We are of the opinion that all uncomplimen
tary remarks concerning the standing of Carnegie 
Tech occasioned by the false reports of the author
ities of the teams played, have been decidedly unsuc
cessful attempts to get smart.
DEAN WEST IN NEW YORK.
Dean West, of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School, has been in New York all of last week look
ing after improvements for the school. The early 
part of the week was spent in company with Miss 
Baldwin, who severs her connection in June. The 
securing of new members for the teaching faculty 
was one of the objects of the trip.
At the present time, the school has under consid
eration the advisability of giving a series of lessons 
for Tech men in camp cooking. Some announce
ment can be made of the decision after Miss West's 
return.
CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The February meeting of the Civil Engineering 
Society will be held Saturday evening, February 
26th. Mr. E. K. Morris will give an illustrated talk 
on Mie erection of the Hawkesbury bridge, Australia.

trofies, these are on the floor; but running trofies 
what you call it? trofies made by our men who 
made the funniest face when they finish a raceOh 
what you call it? Banzai, I got ittrack trofies 
where is they, I shout.
I tink all the Committy have gradually graduated 
but one, who by the way are a real Tech patriot, he 
and Honorable Bright are make to do all the school 
work beside yourself, without tanks (Banzai! for they 
and you), I prefer to Honorable McCorkle, velly nice 
Techsas gentleman. Please ask him to say what 
should be done to the Club Room, if we should put 
trofies on the wall or continue to put them on the 
floor.
Where are the law and order committee of the 
club room, I inquire to know, this time with Hower 
smile, are they slept or been twentitreed by the Hon
orable School. Please publish these Honoabrle names,
I want to tell them vot I tink of the law and order 
in the Club Room and the atmosphere of learning 
that pervades it.
You want to know what it is like you inquire to 
know? Im not afraid to told it you. It is like the 
law and order at a Russian Socialist meeting reek
ing with vodka and onions.
I afraid to enter Honorable Club Room these days,
I always tink I enter sink of enikquitty and leave my 
watch and. inusrance policy in my locker.
Wat are the Honorable Committy doing? 
Schleepin? I inquire to know. Who is the Honorable 
Chairholder, vot you call it? him that holds the chair 
down, Banzai I got itChairman.
Put his foto in your paper, what is called rotten, 
please, so we can see him. Vy dont Honorable 
Senior President boss the show, are it not his privilidge? The kind of order that I see sometimes in the 
Honorabel Club Room, are not in harmony with a 
school of learning as are Tech.
Them is the sentiments, without nocking.
HASHEMOVER TOGO.
To protect undergraduates from poor investments 
after they leave college, the University of Minne
sota is giving a special course in Gold Bricks, and 
other spurious metals counterfeiting the appearance 
of the genuine article.

THE postal reproduced here was sent by a Pennsylvania 
boy who last month entered one of the big medical 
colleges in Philadelphia, his expenses paid by us in return 
for having solicited subscriptions for The Saturday Evening 
Post and The Ladies Home Journal.
What Jack Johnston accomplished 
can be duplicated by any student in the 
Carnegie'Schools. Mr. Johnston is only 
one out of about a thousand young 
men and young women who have done 
the same thing. -
If you want to pay your own way 
through'college we can help you. Upon 
every new subscription and renewal for 
bui gpoctlpm FAivRv, BaMo and
bui CplRiMT naSi eactvpP sent to 
us we will pay you a liberal commission 
and, in addition, a weekly salary, the 
size of the latter depending on the 
amount of business done.-^
If you think you can do what has 
been done >by a thousand other young 
people, with no greater opportunities 
than vou have, drop us a line and every
thing necessary will be sent.
