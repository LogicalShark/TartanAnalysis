THE SITUATIONI
N ALL forms of government, be they Democratic, Social
istic, Counnuuistie, Fascists or monarchical, there exists 
alwaysa.small, group; vi'orlcnig from within, which seeks 
control of the government-, Student government at Amer
ican colleges, following the principles and traditions upon 
which our nation governs-itself, is democratic. Yet, despite 
the idealism that oue generally associates with ond expects 
of. the activities of youth, tlus tendency toward oligarchy 
has became particularly apparent on tlie college campus.
At Carnegie thattendency has long since ceased to. 
exist. It has become an established fact.- To all outward 
appearances Carnegies government, too, is democratic. 
Actually it is .oligarchical.
TUE OLGAHCHY 
It might be termed paradoxical that this negation ot 
true democratic govcrnmenV-e.xists because of Ihc activities 
of the ranking organization, on the Carnegie campusthe 
Dragon Society, mens senioriclass honorary.
Dragon chooses its members on a basi.s of activities,  
leadership arid character. Jta members generally include 
the outstanding men on th-cnmpus iu cxtru-cuiTiciilar ac
tivity. Many of these men have seats on Student council. 
.In. fact, it may have been entirely by accident when it was 
first discovered some time ao that, there were a sufficient 
number of Dragons on Student council to invest that group 
\vitli complete control over the governing body.
When that realization occurred the oligarchy began. 
It has been maintained by tje pursuance of au unwritten 
policy that Dragon pledge 'enough members on Student 
council every year to prvid it with control.
To make complete and all embracing the power it exer
cises over Student council and henne over all student activ
ities, members of the Dj-agon;Society hold all the important 
chairmanships of committees#
Consequently Student council meetings have degener
ated to mere formalities. All matters have been gone 
, through, all/decisions already been made. It remains for 
Student council to. say yes* or no to everything as 
previously deciclcd upon. And it does because it must. 
Student council and Dragon liovc becomc synonymous and 
the whole affair is just A.PUPPET SHOW 1
Were Dragon society on inactive honorary, there 
would perhaps be no complaint or chance for protest. 
There is no intention here to berate the activities of the -in
dividual members. * For those services they deserve honor 
and recognition.
Wp do condemn, however, the fact that they function 
actively as a group and that one of their chief objectives is 
to further their own ends financially.
We do not intend to point ont. definite instances'where 
there has been a misuse of the power Dragon possesses. 
The purpose of this editorial emphasizes what becomes in
creasingly obvious, once one knows the factsthat with 
such a condition existentsuch a combination of, position 
and objective, the entire setup is befrought with POSSI* 
BILITIES for irrcgul^ it inherently rotten.
:V'SVr,rAs'fkrW^
show that advantage has beeni taken .of these possibilities.
. But there is no doubt in our. minds that tlie condition 
is, nevertheless, an unhealthy one, and as long as .it exists, 
democratic government at Carnegie will continue to be a 
myth. . - ' .' , ' __________'

Technology is rational in nature, dealing with the known, culabio, analytically mathematical method."

As Carnegie Men Turn on the Heat
By Emery. E*;-m*A
Early' in the summer of 1930 the 
Coal - Research Laboratory at Car-: 
negie started work. Certain edu
cators and industrial leaders, com
bining ideas and resources, had 
made Its birth possible. These 
men. well-tuned to the spirit of 
progress, felt the necessity of in
vestigating the mysteries of coal, that remarkable chemical substance with which we heat our buildings, drive our engines, melt our steel and operate our factories and from which we obtain synthetic dyestuffs, separate commercial gases, extract medicines and derive a thousand  other useful products. Yet, 'strangely enough,"many'of'Its properties and reactions, much ot its composltlpnand formation had been, and are today, but vaguely explained.The Coal Research Laboratory was, from its inception well organized; its program clearly defined. In the latter part of June,

It Is under6too-diRthisconnection that no expenditures for the ball shall be made . or .contracted for prior to ther date, (four weeks Inadvance of the event) on which it Is determined whether sufficient money has been collected to warrant adeclaion on the part of Student .councilthat preparations for the ball

American Universities Face 
Loss of Academic Freedom
Students Must Fight 
'For Liberty, Says 
College Editor
"TheAmerican campus is faced today with the gravest crisis in Us history, was the opening slate, ment made by JamesA. Wechsler,
talk broadcast over a nationwide network last Wednesday, under spiceB ot the National Student Federation.
Mr. Wechslers subject was The Legend of Acadeniic.Freedom,'' and he spoke of the swift, terrifying strides" being made by the forces eaction. which are threatening destroy our last vestiges of freedom.
lie said of the Hearst crusade bat it symbolizes "the perilous development in American life, a challenge which we can neither dlsiss nor accept with stolidity"  e menace of fascism.
Reaction Is Problem Concerned primarily with the problem of reaction on the campus, he spoke of the controversies centering there about the Idea of academic freedom, which lias long. 'ieen the battle cry of progressive elements in American education. .
Attempting to define academic freedom, Mr. Wecbsler asked hether it is an abstract romantic notion or a precise concrete propobe cited rfcent
freedom, and concluded that It is il dynamic social proposition.
'. Weciisle? asked, Why are teachers who speak forth boldly, who ai-e .sufficiently .courageous to tell the truth about poverty amidst lenty, cracked down upon by Uniorsity administrations?" and .answered by saying that in each instance influential social forces the foundations of the structure of
trustee arid student is existent. He said further that bethe dominant groups in an educationBoards of is, etc., are drawn from: socalleri vested interests, chosen not for scholastic interests and attainments but for financial supremacy. their hostility to social change'is a natural consequence of self-interest.
As schools inevitably grow move awnre of the inanities and Inequities of the economic system' of the insecurity that awaits every graduate, the trustees, as a group if not as individuals, stand behind Hearsts interest in preserving the
fechsler maintained that icademic' freedom is not' a philo;ophic aim but a clearly-defined venpon conditioned by present aoademic freedom today,
he said, means (he opportunity to act on the momentous, immediate issues which confront us; it means an instrument for opposing another world conflict; it a method by which we combat the inroads of suppression."
Youth Battles'Destruction He described the youth of today as a generation battling for -a breathing space in a world crumb-, ling topsy-turvy arounditg heads, and gave a warning against accepting the promises of demagogues such as Long and Coughlin.
Referring to the approaching student strike against tvar and fascism planned for April 12, he 6aid that although it would undoubtedly arouse opposition, it would nevertheless take place as scheduled, and Involve thousands of students in North and South America. He described the strike and what it represents as a fight for life, a solemn warning to those who have charted - a. future of death and destruction.
In closing hfe said that each blow delivered against fascism and reactiou mA a. blow in defence of freedom, in 1776 men.gave their blood to achicve lire, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Our quest of 1935 has a valiant tradition behind it.

H
EARSAY running rampant the past tew 
days on the campus concerning, the pos
sible abolishment of the Carnegie womens 
rifle team, United States champions, as a me
dium for intercollegiate competition has been 
the cause of great concern. It seems that the 
Womens Athletic association is taking a stand
 against rifle as a competitive activity because, 
at present, it is the only form of sport, with 
the possible exception of an occasional tele
graphic archery contest, in which Carnegie 
women participate with teams from other col
leges and universities.
On the surface it appears that the whole
 matter la rooted in a difference of opinion be
tween the W. A. A., the rifle team, itself, and 
Coach Sergeant A. C. Sommer. The W. A. A.
- opposes the discrimination between the vari
ous womens sports by offering varsity letters 
only to members of the rifle team. W. A. A. 
members feel that no more recognition should 
be glvin the rifle team than is provided for 
under the point system" for womens intra
mural sports. The members of the rifle team 
feel that as long as all other colleges in which 
. 'women's rifle is a recognized sport award 
worthy participants with varsity letters, Car
negie should do. the same. Sergeant Sommer 
feels that the nature of the sport requires in. tercollegeiate competition lo make it worth 
while, and that unless It is run on the same 
basis &b In other'progressive schools, the na
tional champlonhlp team at Carnegie might 
veil be abolished.
 Beyond all shadow of a doubt, the womens 
tlfle team has contributed aa much, it not 
more, than any of the other recognized sports, 
to bring glory and prestige to Carnegie. Last 
year'It boasted of the national women's cham
pion, and this year the team, itself, will be 
.heralded throughout the country as the win
ners of the national womens rifle match. For 
this reason, if for no others, it would be un
fair, absurd, and even narrow-minded on the 
part of any organization to rob Carnegie of

HE REMEMBERS THE FORGOTTEN MAN
By Robert R. FrenchAs the country faces the problem of feeding and.clothing about 22.375,000 people, Harry L. Hopkins, administrator of the FERA, takes the spotlight. When General Johnson was gar* rulously parading the country for NRA, Hopkinswas. quietly at work on the largest relief task this country has undertaken. During the fall of 1933 Hopkins, with some of hiB aides, toured the country, but where .Hopkins was unassuming and cqnvlncing, Johnson was harsh and fiery and he got the newspaper space. Hopkins looked, listened and talked, and out of Ihis came the CWA, planned in early October in a Pullman drawing room on a train somewhere between Kansas City and Chicago as the group of men returned to Washington. Relief got under way, despite doubt and criticise, and 4,000,000 men were put to work.Hopkins brings to his position adminislra* live ability and a time-worn idealism. He is essentially a social worker, for he has done nothing else since he arrived in New York City with a Plii Beta Kappa key, and a job running a boys camp, in New York City he directed fresh-air work and unemployment relief and was in charge of. directing widows pensions for the Board of Civil Welfare from 1913 to 1917. During the war he managed civilian relief in New Orleans and the southern division of the Red Cross. Later he returned to New York City lo head the New York Tuberculosis and Health association. In April, 1932, Roosevelt appointed him director of New York State's temporary emergency relief administration, and in May. 1933, he left his $15,- 000 n year job lo go to Washington to direct federal reliel. Supervising the spending of $500,000.000 through nearly 5.000 local public relief organizations. Hopkins took a ?5,000 cut when be became administrator of FERA.
Quiet, modest, lean of face and figure with slightly greying brown hair, he has the valuable cynicism of the trained social worker who loves his job. Old methods and ideals will not be accepted by him merely for their hallowed antiquitythey must work. Hopkins likes ideas, however, and can make them work, but he misses one of his -first assistants who recently left him because, as he says. NOW I have to thiDk up crazy ideas instead of squeching the crnzy Ideas that you used to think up for me."
Bom in Iowa, forty-three years ago, Hopkins came from pioneer stock. His grandmother moved the family by covered wagon from Massachusetts into the Middle West, while his grandfather was fighting In the Union
graduated In 1912.
In Washington Hopkins has the reputation of an executive who can handle hie assistants, his own job and politicians. He is admitted into the first rank of presidential advisers. Fov the most part Hokftlns is mild, but he can let loose when he feels It will do the most good. His assistants are given full responsibility, but when they fail, they go out. He went after the smug complacency of Henry P. Fletcher, chairman of the National Republican Party, and then tackled William E. Borah, Idahos perennial orator, when Borah accused the relief administration of political disbursetemporary prob-tained and. that relief is lem. While we strove last winter, he has said, "to provide relief on reasonably adequate standards, a majority of the needy were improperly housed, fed and clothed. It is not only the parents we have to keep in mind but the children, who have to live under these squalid conditions. We. shall have to answer for these conditions under which some of the unemployed have to live, and the effort made to date to correct them Is no excuse. In every continue trying

- SATURDAY'S CHILD;
Overnight an extraordinary metomorphosis hod taken' place. At nine oclock last night William Grainger, Jr., of 4-B, Blair Grade Scbool, had retired; this morning a bronzed, god-Ilke man name Pierre Le Blanc, fur-trapper and trail-blazer, arose from the very bed in which \pilliam 'had slept unmolested for nine years. The stranger reached lazily for Williams knlckwatching the smooth play of muscles
the high boots that Williams mother had bought on the strength of her sons advice concerning their long-wearing qualities, and buttoned on the red-checlcered flannel shirt which had been twice-rescued by William from the rag barrel. Then, with a flourish, he carefully set on'his head the final glowing insignia of his professionGrandfather Graingers fur hunting cap with, ear laps aad a flowing raccoon tail. He gazed enraptured Into his mirror, muttered a few experimental "by Gars, and descended to the dining room.
Williams mother, beingia rather dull woman, did not. recognize Pierre Le Blanc. She only saw her son,- William; looking veTy hot and very ridiculousIn a fur cap. As he ate hiB cereal and munched his toast, pretending that it was dried venison, she exhorted him to remove the offensive hat by pointing out the fact that hunting season had not yet begun, and Anally ended by appealing to'his aesthetic sensibilities. He remained obdurate, but as a concession, he promised to sweep the front porch. When he had finished eating, he described a few seml-clrcles several inches above the floor of the porch with a broom, hid tbe broom behind the hedge, and turned to the woods. A few of hiB , friendsgood  enough lellows . during. <ch'odt'h't}urs, but 'Wholly' uninitiated In the-art of fur-trappingcalled to him as he ran down the street. He Ignored their callous remarks and subtle insinuations about his attire as they pursued him into a clump of trees near the edge of the town. He'soon outdistanced them, and hurried, warm and glowing from the spirited chase, to a certain tree nearthe reek where he had burled a can of worms several weeks ago.
" -Now he -'disinterred the'-worms to see if they had assumed a state of rigor mortis. After he had noted that they were rigid and extremely dehydrated, he counted them aud put them back into their coffin. For a while be could not decide whether to use the worms that morning, or to await until cold weather had frozen the top of  the creek into ice. Finally be decided to keep them a few months; fur-trappers, he remembered, usually fished through' holes

Be Misunderstood ,r might easily be m derstood to be/nerely Shaws reluct' admission that there can be no really successful substitute for marriage. Superficially Shaw makes Ihis admission, but he has not intended this as the message of his play. In reality Getting Married to be a severe criticism of British marriage and divorce laws and of the system which they esent. He admits that there is present no adequate substitute marriage only because society iot yet ready to accept a satisfactory substitute for or even a ref existing laws. This exposShaw has written this play in a form little used in modern drama; following with precision tbe cla6S' Stonehenge, so' ttiat he would be able find the place again. He wet his forefinger, held it to the breeze to determine In what direction the wind was blowing, and then, faintly surprised because lie could feel no cold rush .of air, he started
earned by snaring seven bears and innumerable rabbits. . He paused outside a theater, -torn between desire for', an ice cream soda and the attractions of a photoplay called THE BORDERLINE. Finally he entered the theater, because he bellevcents: he tortured himself by thinking of the soda, its beautiful, heaped*up foam, Its delectable, double-rich ice cream, the lost ecstasy of the final sip of its heavy syrup from the bottom of the glass. In utter boredom he kicked tbe seat in front of him. unmindful of the caustic remarks of the woman who obviously enjoyed watching the, stupid' love-.scenes. He had so little Interest-In 'the picture that he  amusedltlmself-.-by-arguing-withth*-user - who wanted-him to Vegjove.his fur hat.

belonged to the Betas because they tossed in a side show at no 
extra charge  . Beetle Ely, their maestro, was all right, but It
did look, for a while that, he was going to run for a touchdown

CARNIVAL Dana was sweating his beard off the other day be* 
cause it took the campus queen nominees an.hour to powder their 
respective noses to have their picture taken . . . then it took the 
cameraman a half an hour to get one shot . . . and two hours 
more before he could get a flash bulb to take another.
POLITICS: First mention of tbe coming campus elections and 
their Inseparable polutitics comes from the rumor that the Dramats have .decided to rebel against the present otder in which 
they assumed a very minor position, and are going to run Carl 
Dozer for president ot the Arts School Senate. Another indica
tion of -the radical element in the drama department is the fact 
that some of the girls think that the engineers are good enough 
to go out with them now (it couldnt possibly be due to the obvious'Iack of men in tfieir dept.)
SIMPLE SAYINGS: With credit to Harold Baer .we repeal, the 
following pun of the week . .  first herring, "what happened to

Seattle, Washington. 
Dear Carnegie Tech:
I am writing to you from the 
beautiful campus of the Uni' 
sity of a Thousand Years. The 
University of Washington' was 
rounded in 1S61 in the heart ol 
what is now tbe Metropolitan busi
ness district iq Seattle. In 1S94, it 
was proposed lo move the campus 
to its present location, still well 
within the city limits. In that year 
the cornerstone for the first build
ing, Denny Hall, was laid. We have 
582 acres, of land, 109 acre; 
which are open water. The 
pus borders on two lakes, Lake 
Washington and Lake Union. We 
have thirty buildings now instead or one, also a large stadium and a permanent art gallery, with two hundred pieces of nineteenth century art and a traveling collection, donated by Horace Henry, a prominent Seattle pioneer. .Most of oti campus is landscaped, but in th northern corner there are still se^ erol acres of evergreen forest. I., addition, we have a lovely Sylvan theater in which stand the four columns or the first building on the original campus; surrounding the Sylvan theater is a formal garden.
8,763 Students Enrolled 
Our student body is larger this year than ever before in its history. We have enrolled iu school 8.763 stud^nt.B,. attending, aine different colleges and schools, i , 
Washington boasts of a beautiful Greek row. The houses are indeed a show place of Seattle, and think they equal in size and chitecture those of any campus in the Ignited States. We have thirtynine national fraternities and twenty-two national sororities.
We also have organizations for

With the Style S(hbw just around 
the coiner its time to call attenlon 
to a lew ot the sew innovations io 
mens styles for spring. As the 
weather gets warmer it becomes 
harder and harder to. sit down-at 
a desk and dig into" your school' 
work. No man likeo to stay in
doors when theres warm sun shin
ing outside and a chance to breAthe' some fresh air. You just cant bide, the desire to get out into .the open when spring fever hits you.
One of the most practical outfits
raglan sleeves, sweator -sports wear. The contrasting slacks are really nentthey are pleated, have ribbed seams on the sides, and of course are equipped 'with the famous Talon zipper. The combination - may be had in a variety of colors and patterns, browns, grays, and tans being lb predominant colors. Tilts outfit is reasonably priced at nine and onehalf dollars.
Another valuable addition to any wardrobe is the new and stylish Alpine floece topcoat, it is a smart garment and may be had in either gray or tana concise description of the coat would say that It Is a tbree-b utton. single-breasted topcoat with half belt, set-in sleeves, and roomy patch pockets. Its a standard topcoat for almost any occasion and is sold with an unconditional two-year guarantee at the price or twenty-four fifty.
Shoes have laken on a brownish lint in most cases. One model in particular stands out from tbe rest by virtue of style, sturdiness, and all-around value. This attractive model is a brown Cordovan calf with wing lip. leather heel, anti entirely a hand last shoo. Ft sells for six seventy-five. There are numerous other patterns which ar% worthwhile values and which may be bought for little more than a five spot. Among these styles-is a dull black calf, made on a spade last and reenforced with a steel shank. This is a practical dress shoe and lends a dressy appearance to almost any outfit. Also Btyllsh shoes of suede and buckskin are. availablethese are winning In creasing popularity on college campuses throughout the country.

Many Changes Revealed in Campus 
Layout Since Original 1912 Plans
By Toby Croaa
I dropped Into tbe office of Mr. 
Lawrence H. MJUer, Supervisor of 
Equipment, other ttay to dig 
up some history of Carnegie not 
given la the catalogue. During my 
visit Mr. Miller, who fias been 
here for 16 years, disclosed several 
interesting facts about the campus as it used to be and about original plans tor the schpol which were never carried out.
In his office are several architects drawings ot the campus as it was planned orlglnnlly and dated 1912. The most striking aspect of these drawings was a bridge which was to extend from in front ot EnpJaeeringhall to Forbes street. The lower part of the bridge was to be 'walled lnr partitioned, and used as class rooms. In other words, the road-bed of the bridge would be tlie roof of the building.
Of course in those days the cut was not filled In as It Is now, but a wooded ravine which extended from the B & O railroad tracks up past Engineering ball and Margaret Morrison to Forbes street. The portions of the cut on either side of the proposed bridge were to be ttged ns aa athletic Ifleld and an amphitheater with concrete bleachers built'on the sides of the hills. Across the lower end of the ravine, bordering on the B. & O. tracks, a building was to be erected which would serve as a'field house and gymnasium. The plans for this particular building fell through, for at tjiat time tho B. & O. expected to put a station on the same location.
In 1923 money for a gymnasium
finally chosen. At that time the land across the street was not own* ed by the school. JuBt before work was to begin, however, the school board found that they could purchase this land and did so. After altering tbe design of the gym*
s built in 1924.

Until 1929 In the upper part of 
the ravin by Forbes street was a 
typical farm house, t^ore than a 
hundred years old, complete even 
to a haymow and stalls for the cat* tie. During tbe war it had been used as a barracks and before as a residence. Tbe floors of the house seemed to be quite ordinary for they were painted over. However, when the bouse was torn down at the time of filling In the ravino, it was found that they were solid
The Commons itself has an Inter esting history attached to it. It was butlt in April of 1917 to be used by the government as a ground school for aviation. Tbe actual time ot construction covered only 26 days. At first the Commons was a singlo room with no partitions. Since /'the war numerous changes have been mode in the interior so that It could be used to house class rooms and the cafe teria. During its entire existence It lias never boen considered as a permanent building by the administration, but us a temporary structure to be torn down sometime in the future.
Not many ot the students here now know that It was not until 1929 that the street back of tho Commons and connecting Tech street and Margaret Morrison street was' constructed. Before llien the hill across the street extended almost to the back of the Commons. All thlB ground down to the walk , leading toward the Gymnasium was covered with trees and in a recess just off tho southeast corner of the commons was a small sunken garden with flowers and shrubs. All of this had to be destroyed though, when the rood was put' through. The road has its advantages for before it was put In m\iclf of tho park traffic passed
densely parked cars nil along Margaret Morrison street made croBs* Ing a hazard. Now we stroll across unmolested. ___
