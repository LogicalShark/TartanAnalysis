Delta
Upsilon
evicted,
appeals
by Kevin Chang
Online Design Editor
The fraternity quad might soon un
dergo significant changes. A judicial 
board has recommended that Delta 
Upsilon lose the lease on its house for 
one year.
A University Committee on Disci
pline (UDC) found DU responsible for 
an unspecified violation last week, and 
advised the administration to take the 
fraternitys house away for one year.
Paul Day, president of Carnegie 
Mellons chapter of DU, stated that 
the community should not assume 
that DU will lose its house. As of now, 
nothing is technically official. The de
cision is under appeal, and we wont 
know the final results until President 
Cohon or Dr. Elliott reviews the deci
sion, Day stated.
According to Day, the chapter 
strongly disagrees with the administra
tions move. We are being penalized 
because of risk management issues, 
he stated. The house is already on 
a police-patrol-enforced dry1 status, 
and there have been absolutely no 
incidents at all in the chapter house 
since they began. We dont understand 
why harsher punishments are neces
sary when we have already shown im
provement. Any action taken against 
DU would likely not affect the house 
significantly before the semester ends.
The chapter will continue to build its 
booth and participate in Carnival.
Since the UDCs decision is under 
appeal, administrators refused to 
comment on the process. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Murphy stated,
For confidentiality reasons, we dont 
discuss judicial matters, except to con
firm aggregate data on incidents and 
action by semester, and to disclose 
action against organizations when fi
nalized. Others were bound by confi
dentiality agreements as well. Theres 
only so much that I can say because of 
privacy issues, said John Kubasiak, 
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) presi
dent. Monica Bebie, the Universitys 
coordinator of Greek Affairs, said, Im 
not in a position to comment.
Both the Delta Upsilon national 
organization and Director of Student 
Life Renee Camerlengo were unavail
able for comment.
If DU loses its appeal, the brothers 
will have to vacate the house by some 
point in late May. This decision is 
not immediately effective, nor would 
that be a reasonable demand by the 
University, Day stated. Day stated that 
the house would probably become firstyear housing, with renovations paid for 
by Greek savings, in the interim.
Day categorically denied rumors that 
the fraternitys punishment was a re
sult of sexual harassment, stating, The 
sexual harassment and gay bashing 
idea is absolutely ridiculous. Our situ
ation has nothing to do with anything 
remotely resembling those things.
Members of the Greek community 
seemed unaware of UDCs decision, 
but remained supportive of Delta Up
silon brothers. DU has been a strong 
part of this campus for a long time, 
especially when it comes to Carni
val, and the entire Greek community 
would like to see them succeed and 
remain an active part of the commu
nity even if they are not on the quad, 
said Greek Council President Erin 
Weber.
All I have to say is that as the presi
dent of IFC, IFC is trying to help DU 
work through anything that occurs 
coming from this, said Kubasiak. 
Theres a mixed sentiment on the 
quad as to whats going on and as to 
what the true feeling and mood of the 
university is.
The Universitys plans for the vacated 
house remain unclear.
Hopefully a strong sense of com
munity will be fostered, that of a Greek 
community on the Greek quad, said 
Kubasiak. I have hope for the future.

New athletic director hired to 
lead CMU Athletic Department
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellons search for an 
athletic director ended on March 
31 with the announced hiring of 
Susan Bassett. The athletics de
partment had been looking for 
a candidate since May to replace 
John Harvey, who had held the 
position for more than 15 years 
until retiring in 2004. Swimming 
and diving coach David Belowich 
served as interim director for the 
past 11 months.
Bassett comes to Carnegie 
Mellon from upstate New York 
school William Smith College, 
where she had served as athletic 
director since 1995. William
Smith is the associate school of 
Hobart College  Hobart is all
male, and Smith is all-female. 
Under Bassett, the schools ath
letics programs earned many 
national honors, including two 
NCAA championships in field 
hockey and a mention in Sports 
Illustrated for Women as one of 
the best athletic programs in 
America. While in office, she also 
oversaw the addition of three 
new varsity teams  sailing, 
squash, and golf.
With the addition of Bassett, 
the athletics department will be 
switching one great swimming 
coach (Belowich) with another. 
Before becoming athletic direc
tor at William Smith, Bassett 
coached swimming and diving
at Union College, where she was 
named the Division III Coach of 
the Year, an honor bestowed on 
Belowich just last year. She has 
also coached lacrosse and field 
hockey, giving her a strong and 
diverse athletics background to 
bring to the school.
Susan comes to us with ex
ceptional credentials, and we 
have great confidence in her 
ability to lead our very successful 
varsity and intramural athletic 
programs, said vice president 
for enrollment William F. Elliott. 
Shes a great leader, administra
tor, teacher, and coach who is ad
mired and respected by her peers.

Every year, university 
teams from around the 
globe compete in the In
ternational Collegiate Pro
gramming Contest to see 
who wins the honor of be
ing the finest programmers. 
This year, Carnegie Mellon 
is one of those lucky teams. 
This annual convergence 
of code monkeys in Shang
hai, which runs from Sun
day, April 3 to Thursday, 
April 7, is the final step in 
the International Collegiate 
Programming Contest.
Carnegie Mellon has ap
peared in the World Finals 
several times during the 
competitions history, most 
recently in 2003 when its 
team tied for 21st place 
in the world. The schools 
team this year is particu
larly noteworthy because it 
contains two sophomores 
and one first-year, said the 
teams co-coach, Greg Kesden, a lecturer in computer 
science. We are very junior 
as far as CMUs World Fi

sophomore team member 
Glenn Willen.

Qatari students visit Pittsburgh campus
Candidates state similar goals
Chang Glasgow/Photo Staff
From left to right: Presidential candidate Franklin Williams, Presidential candidate Rachel Gross, and Presidential candidate Tom Sabram. At the Presidential debate held in McConomy Audito
rium on Thursday, the candidates responded to many of the moderators questions by repeating the same points.
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
With elections fast approach
ing, Student Body Presidential and 
Vice-Presidential candidates gathered 
last week for a forum and debate. The 
Vice-Presidential forum, hosted by 
Mudge House, and the Presidential de
bate, hosted by WRCT, The Tartan, and 
cmuTV, were designed to allow candi
dates to answer students questions and 
expound on their different platforms. 
However, their dialogue brought into 
question just how different, or even de
fined, a Student Body Presidential plat
form can be.
One of the primary issues candidates 
focused on was communication and in
formation channels aimed towards stu
dents. During her opening statement 
in the debate on Thursday, Presidential
candidate Rachel Gross remarked that 
Students are not currently being given 
the information they need regarding 
their opportunities and their rights. 
Presidential candidate Franklin Wil
liams agreed, saying, We dont know 
and dont understand how we can utilize 
the sources that are available to us on 
campus.
- During the sparsely attended VicePresidential forum on Tuesday after
noon, Vice-Presidential candidates 
Nicolette Louissaint and Jackie Brook 
narrowed the idea of communication to 
address relations between student or
ganizations. Louissant said that a lot of 
the differences between organizations 
are older than the members themselves, 
and Brook drew verbal images of larger 
groups overpowering and consuming 
smaller organizations with similar pur
poses. The third candidate, Benjamin 
Hackett, did not come, and later said he
was unable to attend the forum.
Although candidates unanimously ac
knowledged communication as a campus 
problem on Thursday, each ticket offered 
a different solution to the problem. 
Whereas Gross and Hackett suggested 
open JFC meetings and a comprehensive 
Student Government website, Louissant 
and Presidential candidate Tom Sabram 
planned to revamp CMUs web portal. 
Williams and Brook wished to expand 
the Universitys first-year leadership pro
grams to include upperclassmen as well.
The other major concern mentioned 
by all three candidates was diversity. 
Gross began her response to the ques
tion of what candidates planned to do to 
address diversity by stating, Its a word 
thats commonly used but never really 
defined. All three tickets expressed a 
desire to broaden the definition of di
versity, in Sabrams words. Sabram and 
Louissaint specifically plan on renovating the multicultural council and possi
bly creating an Office of Multicultural Af
fairs. The three tickets all also mentioned 
forming a stronger relationship with the 
Graduate Student Assembly (GSA).
After the debate, Williams complained 
that many of the questions were too 
open-ended to answer adequately in one 
and a half minutes. In fact, during both 
the forum and the debate only pointed 
questions brought forth more detailed 
and unique answers from each candidate. 
After the moderators question-and-response period, the floor was opened to 
audience members. One such member, 
sophomore chemical and biomedical 
engineering major Samantha Rosenthal, 
prefaced her question on the controver
sial speakers policy with Ive heard all 
of you mention problems and issues, and 
none of them have really been addressed 
specifically. Narrowed queries from the

Their weekend entertain
ment often includes belly danc

peppered with Arabic phrases, 
and they love food just as 
much as their Pittsburgh peers. 
God bless America, said 
Maha Obaidan, digging into a 
brownie sundae at the Walnut
Grill in Shadyside.
Obaidan, a first-year com
puter science major at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Qatar, 
was one of five students from 
the Middle Eastern campus 
who came to Pittsburgh last 
week as part of a cross-campus 
exchange initiative between 
the Pittsburgh and Qatar cam
puses. The five are among 
the first class of students at 
CMU-Q, CMUs satellite cam
pus that opened in Qatar in fall 
2004.
Student Affairs planned the 
trip in conjunction with the Qatar campuss spring break. For 
most of the five who visited, it 
was their first trip to the United 
States.
Its so quiet here! said Yasmine Abderlrahman, referring 
to the volume of activity on the 
Pittsburgh campus. According 
to Abderlrahman, a first-year 
business major, the Qatar cam
pus echoes with music from 
students laptops.

Presidential perspectives: Extending hours in the library and UC
rik Michaels-Ober
As you may know, Hunt Library is 
open 24 hours a day during final exami
nations. However, many students  par
ticularly those taking courses in the Col
lege of Humanities and Social Sciences 
 expressed a demand for greater access 
to the library during the week before fi
nal examinations, as well.
Katie Cooper, a Student Senator from 
the Mellon College of Science and a 
member of the Academic Affairs Com
mittee, met with Erika Linke, the As
sociate Dean of University Libraries for
Collection and User Services, to discuss 
the possibility of extending the hours 
of Hunt Library during the week before 
final examinations. Katie found that the 
library needed additional funds to re
main open during this time.
At their March 17 meeting, Student 
Senate passed a motion to allocate 
$1000 to the Universitys libraries in or
der to keep Hunt Library open 24 hours 
a day during the week before final exam
inations. This will enable students more 
time to do research for final papers or 
study in a quiet location. If the extended 
hours are successful this year, they will 
be included in the librarys budget for fu
ture years. I hope that you will find these 
additional hours useful.
Student government is also working to 
extend the operating hours of the Univer
sity Center. In particular, we would like 
to extend the hours of the athletics facili
ties, the dining locations, and Entropy. 
At present, the doors to the University 
Center are locked at midnight. Students 
lives do not shut down at midnight, and 
neither should our University Center. If 
you have any feedback about this pro
posal, please e-mail concerns@andrew. 
cmu.edu.
I would also like to remind you that 
student government elections are be
ing held today and tomorrow. Please 
read the candidates platforms and vote 
online at elections.andrew.cmu.edu. 
Undergraduates are voting for Student
Body President and Vice President, Stu
dent Body Vice President for Finance, 
Student Senators from their college, 
and a referendum on a $5-per-semester 
newspaper fee. Graduate students are 
voting on Student Body President and 
Vice President and Student Body Vice 
President for Finance. Questions about 
the election should be directed to Mark 
Roboff (mroboff@andrew.cmu.edu),

I havent slept for ten days, because 
that would be too long.
Its often too simple to find the little 
ironies in the words of those who have 
left us. This past Thursday presented 
the comedic world with yet another 
tragedy  and a pause to reflect on the 
impact that Mitch Hedberg had on the 
stand-up scene.
Hedbergs death on Thursday after
noon was especially poignant to the 
students here at Carnegie Mellon. After 
all, it was only last Spring Carnival that 
he performed at Midway to a tent over
flowing with the college demographic 
he was most in tune with. Hedberg was 
a hit immediately: his classic one-liner 
routine was already so popular that 
audience members knew bits by heart. 
He looked tired, and occasionally he 
stumbled. But few comedians today are 
as beloved as he was to this crowd, and 
his delivery was taken as part of the 
routine. As always, it was hilarious.
Although officially he died of heart 
failure, the rumors began circulat
ing about Hedbergs death last Thurs
day afternoon  as fast as a speeding 
blog. It was no secret that he had been 
troubled by heroin addiction for years, 
and just two years ago he was arrested 
in Austin, Texas for felony possession. 
Even his mother, Mary Hedberg, said 
in interviews that his problem was 
known.
But last week in Livingston, New 
Jersey, when traveling between shows, 
gossip said that it had finally caught up 
with him.
I didnt want to believe what I had 
read, though; even Hedbergs own 
site still listed future show dates. It 
didnt hit me until late Thursday night, 
when an editor from the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star Tribune called me in 
class to ask if he could run a photo I 
had taken of Hedberg from his Spring 
Carnival appearance for his obituary. 
Hedberg was from the St. Paul area; he 
ran away from home as a teen to pur
sue his career. Now a photo I had taken 
of him  the same photo that appears 
on the back of todays Pillbox section  
was running in his hometown papers 
obituary.
The year before 2004s Carnival
 my freshman year  my roommate 
took me to the Waterfront one night 
to see my first Mitch Hedberg perfor
mance. I had watched the clips from his 
Comedy Central routines in the days 
beforehand, but standing in front of 
that brick wall on stage, he seemed all 
the more disarming. His delivery was 
reminiscent of the television stereotype 
1970s stoner, and each one-liner met 
with a sharp burst of laughter from his 
audience. I was right in his hands.
But Hedberg never seemed to know 
that it was his audience. He stared 
down at the stage behind his shaggy, 
drooping hair and enormous pink avia
tors, often closing his eyes as he grinned 
nervously through delivery. He shuf
fled his feet; he mumbled asides like, 
This shows goin all right, I guess. It 
didnt matter that he had appeared on 
Letterman ten times and been called 
the next Seinfeld by Time magazine; 
like so many college students in the 
audiences he played for, Hedberg was 
always unsure of himself.
With the greatest talent often come 
the greatest demons. Although he 
poked fun at himself relentlessly  he 
often quipped, I used to do drugs. 
I still do drugs. But I used to, too
 Hedbergs fame failed to infuse any 
confidence into his act.
In mid-March, after he called five 
nights in a row to cancel acts in Rich
mond, Virginia, I wonder if he realized 
his spiral. I only wish that those around 
him realized it as well.
Alcoholism is a disease, Hedberg 
joked of addiction, but its the only 
one you can get yelled at for having. 
Goddamn it, Otto, youre an alcoholic. 
Goddamn it, Otto, you have lupus. 
One of those two doesnt sound right. 
We were never yelling at you, Mitch; all 
we ever did was laugh.

Pittsburgh hosts 
Qatari students
QATAR, from A1
tinguish the group from other 
CMU students. Even though 
we come from different cul
tures, were all typical college 
students. We all have the same 
goals of succeeding  were all 
part of CMU, said Abderlrahman in the groups presentation 
last Wednesday.
The Qatari students pre
sented a video and spoke 
about their college experience 
to students and faculty. Dur
ing the presentation, the five 
spoke about the importance of 
the campuss inauguration two 
weeks ago.
During the Pittsburgh cam
pus spring break, 12 students 
and several staff members from 
the Pittsburgh campus trav
eled to Qatar to participate in 
an inauguration ceremony. The 
ceremony signified that the 
Qatar campus was open and 
operational, although students 
had begun classes there last 
year.
For the first time, we felt so 
connected to our campus, said 
Abderlrahman. Now were not 
just a vision that CMU has.
There are 41 students en
rolled in the CMU-Q class of 
2008. Unlike its Pittsburgh 
peer, the Qatar campus is ap
proximately 75 percent female. 
According to the five students, 
almost every student on the 
Qatar campus takes a robotics 
course, and most students live 
at home.
Like CMU students, we work 
hard. But we also balance our 
social life, said Wesam Said, a 
first-year business major.
One of four American branch 
campuses in Qatars Education 
City, CMU-Q offers under
graduate courses in business 
administration and computer 
science. Other campuses with 
branches include Virginia 
Commonwealth University, 
Weill Cornell Medical College, 
and Texas A&M University.
Speaking about their par
ticipation in joint activities with 
other colleges in Education 
City, the Qatari students found 
the lesser interaction between 
colleges on the Pittsburgh cam
pus surprising. It seems every 
college has its own life here, 
Noora Al Ansasri, a first-year 
business major, referring to the 
individual colleges within the 
university.
What else do the students 
feel are differences between the 
campuses? Qatar is so open to 
culture, said Obaidan. Since 
there are no [ethnic] majorities 
or minorities, nobody can judge 
anyone else.
I had such a great time 
there, and I feel so strongly 
about the importance of the 
Qatar campus success that I 
have applied to TA there next 
fall, said Matt Laroche, a 
junior computer science major. 
Laroche was one of the students

Students from both cam
puses have commented on 
how quickly they felt a kin

is wonderful, said Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy.
Prior to returning to Qatar, 
first-year business major and 
Qatar Student Body President 
Fahad Al-Jefairi wore a T-shirt 
that read: What happens on 
spring break stays on spring 
break. However, Student Affairs 
hopes to further strengthen the 
bond between both campuses 
through pen pal programs, fu
ture trips, and potential cross
campus registration and video 
conferencing.
I expect there to be many 
opportunities for our students 
here and there to come back and 
forth, said Dean Murphy, both 
for visits and for semesters of 
study.

of problems they will see at re
gional and the World Finals. The 
course also helps teams cope with 
the complications of having three 
people to one computer. Theres a 
good deal of teamwork, of course, 
said Quisel. Fink noted that one of 
the hardest things to teach stu
dents is how to get accustomed to 
the three-to-one person-to-computer ratio.
Kesden has his own theory for 
what might make the three stu
dents so skilled at programming. 
[They are] smart, motivated peo
ple who were exposed to it early, 
he said. Willen was given an in
troductory programming book as 
early as age eight or nine. Despite 
Willens early exposure, the team 
teases Danaher for presumably 
reading the book meaning 
Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest (known 
as CLR), the course book used for 
teaching algorithms to seniors in
college or first-year graduate stu
dents.
...[The book] was actually a 
gift. I was an assistant [systems] 
administrator in high school. As a 
gift they gave me CLR.... Over the 
summer I was bored and it looked 
interesting, said Danaher.
Not everyone has had the 
tenacity to read the coursebook 
taught to seniors in college, but all 
three team members have had at 
least one semester concentrating 
on problems and situations similar 
to those seen at World Finals.
In addition to academic merit, 
Fink pointed out how beneficial 
being in World Finals can be for 
a students career in the com
puter industry. To those inside the 
profession, he said, the competi
tion is well-known and an impres
sive addition to a programmers 
resume. However, there is no 
monetary prize for winning World 
Finals.
The World Finals, Kesden noted, 
provide a much more professional 
competing environment than re
gional. The team doesnt really 
expect to win, because, as Willen 
noted, teams from other countries 
are often playing in World Finals 
with a lot more at stake, such as 
their future livelihood. That does 
not prevent the team from being 
excited, however.
Im still in denial, said Wil
len of leaving the country. Quisel 
added, Im not going to get any 
sleep tonight.
The competition will be all over 
by this Thursday, when the results 
will be in on this years overall 
World Finals program.
Presidential candidates face off
DEBATE, from Al
audience also addressed presi
dential relations with the Stu
dent Dormitory Council (SDC) 
and how to improve attendance 
at CFA functions.
Some felt that the Presidential 
debates were more successful 
than in previous years. I would 
say that I was most impressed 
with the number of people that
came out to listen to the debate, 
said debate moderator Greg Batta
glia. I think that seeing so many 
folks come out to listen to the 
views of the candidates to make 
a better informed decision is a 
great sign that people on campus 
are becoming more involved and 
caring more about student leader
ship in the future.
However, a few of the candi
dates were aware of the similari
ties in their statements. All of our 
overall opinions are very similar, 
but the fundamental differences 
lie in our methods of achieving 
our goals. We couldnt really ad
equately express that without be
ing able to respond to our oppo
nents, and without a rebuttal, it 
wasnt possible, said Williams.
Breanna Zwart, a first-year in 
H&SS who attended the debates, 
was also struck by the lack of
unique responses.
There werent really any stand
outs in the debate, she said. Ev
eryone kept repeating what ev
eryone else was saying, and there 
wasnt too much distinction.

The Gun Show brings out the 
best in CMU students, athletes
The Athletics Council scored another 
victory on Friday with The Guns of 
Carnegie. Jock jams blared through the 
University Center as contestants faced 
off in what was most likely CMUs first 
arm-wresding competition. The Athletics 
Council continued its drive to raise school 
spirit regarding athletics by creating an 
event that made everyone in attendence 
smile.
The beauty of the Gun Show lay in its 
simplicity. There are few sports that could 
be more obvious than arm-wrestling, and 
the clever name matched its straight
forward idea. With T-shirts and towels 
to give away, the Athletics Council pre
sented an event that aimed only to get 
students excited about athletics.
These are the things we should ex
pect from the Athletics Council. As sim
ple as the event may be, there are few 
challenges more complicated than get
ting students excited about athletics at 
Carnegie Mellon. When our athletes and 
teams win awards, honors, and champi
onships, few people take notice. Home 
matches of all sports are under-attended; 
its become a running joke that nobody 
attends football games.
Low interest in University athletics is 
both a symptom and a cause of a lack 
of school spirit, and its something that
ought to change. We all chose to attend 
a Division III school, knowing full well 
that our classmates are more likely to be 
leaders of industry'than leaders of the 
gridiron. Nonetheless, there is no reason 
why we shouldnt support our classmates 
by becoming more engaged with athletics 
on this campus.
We are students at one of the best 
universities in the country; we should 
act like we are proud of that fact. One 
neednt be an ardent fan of the sport of 
football to enjoy watching our beloved 
Tartans. Small steps could be taken by 
the University to improve support for our 
Varsity and Club athletes. One way to 
improve attendance is to relax rules on 
tailgating and to build seating areas in 
the UC gym, Skibo Gym, and the pool.
Until the administration gets around to 
improving seating, the Athletics Council 
is doing it all right. Events like these 
get students to be more involved with 
University athletics by being accessible 
and enjoyable. The Athletics Council has 
figured out that students like to have fun 
and the Council is working hard to meet 
student needs. More events like these are 
great (but enough with the towels, we 
have enough towels) and we hope that 
students begin to root for the Glory of Old 
Carnegie on a more regular basis.
USA Today readership program 
lacks thought students deserve
Newspapers are irreplaceable. They 
chronicle current events and promote 
a vital dialogue of ideas and opinions. 
In this student government election, 
students have an opportunity to demon
strate their support for building a deeper 
appreciation of newspapers among 
undergraduates by voting yes on a ref
erendum creating a five-dollar student 
fee for funding a newspaper readership 
program. An effective program would 
achieve the admirable goal of promoting 
readership and would be well worth the 
investment.
The challenge, however, is not just 
funding such a newspaper program but 
ensuring its responsible administration. 
The impetus for the referendum was the 
pilot program, the USA TODAY Collegiate 
Readership Program. Unfortunately, this 
program is being misrepresented by USA 
TODAY. We support this referendum, but 
student government must push beyond 
existing efforts and create a responsi
ble, effective, and suitable program for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Considering the existing concerns, it 
seems as though there is no defined plan 
for the implementation or management 
of the Collegiate Readership Program. 
There must be a specific organization 
to take responsibility for the programs 
administration. Student Senate must 
be responsible for promoting the pro
gram and ensuring that students are 
able to take advantage of the provided 
opportunities. As the planning process 
continues, Senate must hold public fo
rums ensuring that student interests are 
represented in any newspaper reader
ship program.
Additionally, it is impossible today to 
ignore the significance of digital media, 
particularly the availability of news on 
the Internet and the growing importance 
of news blogs. It is vital that any intro
duction of newspapers to campus con
sider the relationship of students to other 
forms of media and news. A successful 
plan will work in conjunction with In
ternet resources to the greater benefit of 
the students.
The USA TODAY Collegiate Readership 
Program is a flawed program, repre
sented by USA TODAY as an educational 
initiative. In reality, it seems to be more 
of a marketing scheme to boost advertis
ing revenue as they increase purported 
readership among college students. 
With the readership program infiltrat
ing college campuses, USA TODAY can 
sell more ad space, claiming that the 
program reaches an untapped audience 
and breeding future readers in college 
students.
The referendum presents a great 
opportunity for the University to invest 
in a strong effort to promote newspaper 
readership, engage students in current 
events, and increase the quality of edu
cation delivered at Carnegie Mellon. We 
must ensure that the short-sighted plan
ning of the USA TODAY program does not 
squander the noble ideal, and instead 
establish a desirable alternative reader
ship program.
Editorial Dissent
The referendum is not the way to cre
ate student readership. We should focus 
on more accessible mediums, not simply 
printed news. Charging all students for 
newspapers that the majority will not 
read is irresponsible. We should take 
steps towards addressing news reader
ship in general, not focus solely on print. 
Newspapers are one of the most acces
sible forms of news available. Students 
wanting to read newspapers are probably 
reading them already, whether printed or 
otherwise.

As the chair of the Activities Board 
I feel it is necessary to respond to 
last weeks piece [Students antici
pating Carnivals arrival want to see 
it publicized, 3/28]. While there is 
certainly criticism due for the late 
announcement of the concert and co
median for Spring Carnival 2005, this 
piece lands far off target with whom to 
pin the blame on.
Carnival Committee has very little 
to do with both of these events, since 
they are actually run by AB Concerts 
and AB Comedy. Carnival Committee 
simply waits for AB to provide them 
with information so that they can do 
their publicity and do any logistical 
planning.
Bids for both acts went out between 
mid-January and early February, which 
should be enough lead time in most 
cases, but this has obviously been 
proven false. Agents connected to both 
acts took an irregular amount of time 
to get contracts to us, and once they 
were received, the contracts have not 
done much more than collect dust in 
some office of the Universitys legal 
department.
You have to remember, professional 
staff of the University work 9-5, Mon
day through Friday, and will get to 
things when they get to them. There 
is no way for us as students to urge 
them to move any faster, nor can our 
advisor in the Office of Student Activi
ties urge them to advance the process. 
Since publicity cannot start until both 
sides have signed the contracts, really 
all that AB and Carnival Committee 
can do is sit back and wait for higher 
powers to do their job, hopefully in a 
timely manner.
In reality, the students at Carnegie 
Mellon only need to know when and 
where to pick up wristbands for the 
comedian and concert and who the 
acts are. Everyone knows when and 
where Carnival is going to happen (we 
have a few days off classes that week 
and the collection of structures that 
is soon to be built on the Morewood 
parking lot is pretty hard to miss). 
Doing a round of publicity without 
the concert and comedian informa
tion on it is simply a waste of money, 
something that Carnival Committee 
cannot afford.
I acknowledge the fact that The 
Tartan is constantly working to bring 
positive change to our community, 
many times using the Forum section as 
the vehicle, but in this case I feel that 
the outcome is the opposite of what 
was intended.
First, the factual errors and lack of 
research prior to writing that is obvious 
to anyone whom the piece is aimed at. 
These errors only serve to make hard
working students even more frustrated 
with the protracted contracting 
negotiations.
This piece should be written about 
how the bureaucratic machine that is 
the administration of Carnegie Mellon 
University should be reformed, not a 
watered-down jab at Carnival Commit
tee. Only when criticism is on target 
and factually accurate will it have its 
intended outcome.
It is my hope that The Tartan is more 
successful in the future with the writing 
of critical essays about the issues that 
the campus community faces.

Guns on Campus:
Campus weapons policy needs to be reevaluated
Adam Greenberg
Lets get some things straight: I dont 
own a gun; I have never fired a gun; 
and I dont plan on ever doing either.
Every discharge of a firearm is part 
of a tragedy. Some are based on the 
harm they cause; others, the harm they 
prevent. I believe students have the 
right to protect themselves from harm.
At present, campus policy prevents 
students from storing or carrying any 
firearm or deadly weapon on campus 
except with specific exceptions made 
by the chief of campus police. There 
are three basic reasons a student would 
want to have a weapon on campus. The 
first is if a student wanted to store a 
rifle for use in off-campus hunting. The 
other two are for handguns: attacking 
and defending. It is understandable 
that people would be wary of allowing 
students to carry deadly weapons freely 
around campus. Professors might fear 
that entire classrooms would be filled 
with students armed to the teeth and 
ready to fire at the first instructor who 
gives them a grade they dont like.
Aside from that, professors would 
also be allowed to carry weapons, these 
students have little preventing them 
from carrying out these actions now. 
Pennsylvania is a shall issue state. 
Im over 21, Ive never been convicted 
of a felony, and Im fairly sure I could 
pass the safety requirements. Except 
in the City of Philadelphia, the sheriff 
of my home county is required in these 
conditions to issue me a permit to carry 
a concealed firearm.
Professors might think that the Uni
versitys policy protects them from a 
classroom filled with weaponry. They 
should consider how many students 
would bring guns but for the policy. At 
institutions that allow them, only about 
one in 20 students carries a weapon of 
any type. Most students willing to re
fuse a professors request not to bring 
weapons into the classroom would re
fuse to follow the current policy any
way. Assault with a deadly weapon is 
a felony in the first degree in Penn
sylvania; faced with those charges, no 
one is going to care about violating a 
University policy.
I am not advocating violence against
anyone. The fact is, crime happens. 
Over the last few years, our campus 
has seen aggravated robberies and the 
occasional sexual assault. To suggest 
that weapons are a catch-all solution 
to these problems is foolish, but the 
Pennsylvania constitution states quite 
prominently that citizens have the right 
to defend themselves using weapons. 
Felony charges far outweigh anything 
the University could do to a student 
who exceeds his rights. The Universitys 
policy therefore only seriously affects 
students who legally protect them
selves by using a registered weapon.
Parallels can be drawn to the school 
shootings that have occurred around 
the country. In the last few weeks, 
we have watched as one tragedy 
unfolded in a school in Minnesota. 
A student murdered his grandfather 
and his grandfathers companion, then 
took the weapon to school and killed 
a half-dozen of his classmates before 
killing himself.
I am not so presumptuous as to as
sume that other students carrying 
weapons could have prevented any of 
these school shooting tragedies, except 
possibly by deterrence. If the schools  
paranoia had not prevented them from 
arming their security guard I believe 
there is a good chance tragedy would 
have been averted. School shootings 
at the high school level occur in spite 
of similar zero-tolerance weapons 
policies. The state should not permit 
minors to arm themselves, but addi
tional responsibility is often afforded 
college-level students over high school 
ones; this issue should be treated no 
differently.
Another consideration is training. 
No one should ever handle a loaded 
weapon without proper training; 
it is one of the basic requirements 
for owning a gun. Carnegie Mellon 
should never tolerate an improperly 
trained students owning or operat
ing a weapon, because the state does 
not. But this cannot excuse CMUs not 
accepting gun ownership by properly 
trained individuals. Protecting students 
from some guns by prohibiting all is di
rectly opposed to the Universitys usual 
handling of such issues. For example, 
the University permits alcohol for those 
legally allowed to consume it  albeit 
with some restrictions. Similar restric
tions could easily be enacted, such as
a requirement that weapons be locked 
up when not in use or the creation 
of specialized living areas like those 
now offered as substance-free envi
ronments.
Obviously, were Carnegie Mellon a 
public university, the situation would 
be quite different. Public university 
firearms are more numerous; as agents 
of their respective states, they are ef
fectively required by law to permit legal 
weapons on campus. George Mason 
University in Virginia, known for its 
conservative student body, recently was 
petitioned to allow weapons on cam
pus. The State of Utah has concealedcarry laws approximately equivalent 
to Pennsylvanias, and its attorney gen
eral has ordered its public colleges to 
change their policies to permit guns, in 
compliance with state law.
As a private institution, Carnegie 
Mellon is not required to respect a weap
ons permit like these public schools, 
but it has never offered a reason other 
than nebulous claims of safety. The 
University makes known quite well that 
it aims to preserve our First Amend
ment rights  as they should  but 
not our right to self-defense. The fed
eral constitution can be debated about 
whether or not it merely means weap
ons in militias; Pennsylvanias consti
tution clearly states that the right to 
bear arms in defense of oneself shall 
not be abridged by the state. From the 
standpoint of the academic integrity 
the University claims in First Amend
ment matters, they should accept the 
balance of our rights.
Carnegie Mellon has established a 
weapons policy in the interest of pro
tecting all who come to its campus. I 
follow the policy and respect University 
officials for doing what they think is 
best. But because the policy is only 
preventing legal uses of items deemed 
acceptable by Harrisburg, it carries no 
weight.
If the University cannot adequately 
protect us from the maniacal use of 
firearms, students should be permitted 
to carry theirs for protection.

Bring secret funding process into the light
___________Alexander Meseguer
The people who dole out the 
student activities fee have been 
keeping secrets from you and 
from the press. The Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC), the arm of 
Student Senate charged with the 
task of distributing your student 
activities fee for next year, has 
banned non-JFC students from 
the meetings on two occasions. 
Students were not allowed in, 
not even as silent observers. This 
exclusion deprived the student 
body of its right to both know 
how the activities fee money is 
being allocated and verify that it 
is a fair and unbiased process.
The process has been a bit 
confusing. Nicolette Louissaint, 
chair of the JFC, voted to close at 
least one of the meetings while 
encouraging the committees 
representatives to fully discuss 
what goes on inside these meet
ings with the student organiza
tions they represent. Assuming 
complete trust between the stu
dent organizations and their 
representatives is nice on paper, 
but is it really wise to put all our 
eggs in the student government 
basket? I dont think so. One of 
the most important missions of 
journalism is to serve as a watch
dog over the government.
When student organizations 
submit their budgets for con
sideration, they go through two 
major phases of deliberation: 
review and appeal. The appeals 
portion of the funding process 
is especially important and emo
tionally charged; organizations 
appeal the funding decisions of 
the JFC, and its the last chance 
they will have to argue for funds
in their budgets.
Why close the meetings? What 
do they have to hide or protect?
Some JFC members recalled 
an incident when the baseball 
team came to the appeals meet
ing wielding baseball bats. Quite 
the intimidating situation; the 
committee would have been well 
within their rights to call Campus 
Police. However, the mere pres
ence of organization members 
during appeals deliberation is 
nothing like that. Sitting quietly 
in the corner as if youre on time 
out doesnt intimidate anyone.
Louissaint said intimidation 
from the presence of members 
from groups filing an appeal 
would hinder the process and 
make members of the funding 
committee uncomfortable in dis
cussing allocations. Steven Kling, 
the vice-president for finance 
and a non-voting member of 
the committee, said many other 
funding committees on campus
close their meetings. But, its dif
ferent when you have student 
control of student funds; These 
are sad excuses for shrouding 
the process.
I know having an open process 
is important to members of the 
committee, and I dont doubt the 
intentions of those who choose 
to spend a good chunk of their 
lives making sure student or
ganizations get their fair slice 
of the student activities fee pie. 
But they should have the stu
dents peace of mind at heart and 
toughen up a little bit.
Closing the meeting leaves too 
much room for arbitrary budget 
decisions. Opening the meetings 
would force the committee to 
think its decisions through and 
be held accountable. Students 
deserve no less when their pre
cious student activities fee is on 
the line.
The ethical issues and con
flicts of interest that arise from
the fact that JFC members are 
themselves heavily involved 
with campus organizations can 
be dealt with in other ways. 
Maybe the committee should 
be restructured; maybe there 
should be special rules regard
ing the votes of those members 
who are heavily involved in or
ganizations whose budgets are 
being considered. These are 
questions that are beyond the 
scope of this piece, but ones that 
I implore Student Senate and the 
new Student Body President to 
consider over the next year.
On a side note, the members 
of the JFC could consider be
ing a little more professional in 
the way they conduct themselves 
in the meetings. I would advise 
Louissaint to come down hard on 
committee members whose com
ments make their job more dif
ficult by souring relations with 
student organizations. Such com
ments, even when made in jest, 
have no place at meetings and do 
not contribute to the quality of 
the decisions made. If you want 
to know what I mean and learn a 
little bit about how your student 
activities fee is spent as well, go 
to a JFC meeting.
Closing any part of the joint 
funding process, especially the 
appeals portion, is a disappoint
ing lack of openness in a process 
which is so important to student 
life. The appeals are the most 
honest and frank part of dis
tributing the Student Activities 
Fee, and students would lose the 
benefit of knowing that the deci
sions being made are fair, impar
tial, and sensible.

degree in electrical and computer

in the 60s and 70s its associa
tion with The Tartan was ampli
fied by printing the edition un
der an entirely different name.
I must relieve the suspense as 
to the real reason the Natrat did 
not appear, and with bittersweet 
regret, I must inform the pub
lic that the reason is not nearly 
as dramatic as some may think. 
In fact, according to The Tar
tans executive officer, Bradford 
Yankiver, it was a combination of 
a lack of fundingreflective of a 
move to be more fiscally respon
sible and not wanting to look for 
additional money  and a lack 
of time and resources needed to 
print a proper edition that led to 
empty stands on April 1.
After requesting additional 
feedback from the staff and 
leaders at The Tartan on this 
issue, I found there was a spe
cific emphasis on this latter point 
from the Editor-in-Chief, J.T. 
Trollman. [The Natrat] could 
have a place at this newspaper 
again. However, that absolutely 
hinges on its being done well, 
he says. Theres no way that 
we can treat a satire issue with 
a lack of professionalism, as was 
done last year.
I wasnt convinced that 
that could be done this year, 
Trollman continues. I also did

For the past six weeks, I 
have been going through The 
Tartans archives in order to 
publish our Almanac. Ive re
trieved copies of newspapers 
printed in 1955, 1980, 1995, 
2000, and 2004 in order to give 
campus members a better idea 
of our history. There are no 
more regular newspapers for 
me to pull from the spring of 
2004, though: Following the 
Natrat, The Tartan stopped 
regular publication for the re
mainder of the semester.
Even without these 
newspapers to provide a writ
ten record of last year, there 
is a story that can be read ev
erywhere you look on campus. 
Its been one year since the 
publication of the Natrat and 
not enough change has oc
curred on this campus.
There has been a lot of dis
cussion about changes made 
at The Tartan in the past year; 
we even dedicated an entire 
issue to writing about it. Yet 
the Natrat showed us that not 
only did The Tartan need to 
change, but substantial prob
lems exist on our campus that 
have remained unaddressed for 
too long.
Its easy to wring our hands 
and blame various organiza
tions throughout the University 
for the problem. Answering the 
question Who ignored the re
port? is less important than 
answering the question, Why 
was this problem ignored?

Fast food chains should promote health, not harm
Michael Croland
Burger King debuted its 
Enormous Omelet Sandwich 
last week, sending left arms ev
erywhere into an unpleasant tin
gling with 750,000 sold. Just as 
the fast food industry seemed to 
be showing more concern for its 
victims, it has taken an obese step 
backwards.
This colossus of one sausage 
patty, two eggs, two cheese slices, 
and three strips of bacon contains 
730 calories, 47 grams of fat, and 
415 milligrams of cholesterol. 
Thats 330 more milligrams of 
cholesterol than a Whopper! As 
Morgan Spurlock, director of 
the anti-fast-food 
documentary ------------
the industry-leading McDonalds 
have died in the last year, at ages 
44 and 60, from colorectal cancer 
and a heart attack, respectively. 
Lawsuits have blamed fast food 
for causing obesity; Super Size Me 
blamed McDonalds for complete 
loss of health; and Eric Schlossers 
book Fast Food Nation blamed 
fast food for everything else. One 
would expect the fast food indus
try to work toward improving its 
image.
The current trend of pile-onthe-meat meals only invites more 
deserved criticism. A high-fat, 
animal-based diet is the leading 
cause of death from heart disease, 
whereas plant-based foods have no
Super Size Me, has 
suggested, the 
Enormous Omelet 
Sandwich should 
come with a $5-off 
coupon for your

Sadly, Burger Kings 
abomination is not 
unique.
For those who 
like to clog their 
arteries at lunch or 
dinner, Hardees in
troduced a Monster 
Thickburger in 
November. The 
burger contains 
two 1/3-pound beef 
patties, four strips 
of bacon, three slices of cheese, 
and mayonnaise, weighing in at 
1420 calories, 107 grams of fat, 
and 230 milligrams of cholesterol.
In comparison to the Monster 
Thickburger, something grossly 
unhealthy like a Big Mac is 
practically a health food, said 
Meat Market author Erik Marcus 
on his radio show. Hats off to the 
Hardees people for treating their 
customers with the same degree 
of care [with which] the tobacco 
companies treat their customers.

cholesterol and minimal saturated 
fat.
Meat-eaters are twice as likely 
as vegetarians to die of cancer, as 
diet is linked to more than half of 
all cancers. Between one-third and 
one-half of Americans are over
weight, whereas Americans on 
a purely herbivorous diet weigh 
10 to 20 pounds less on average. 
The healthful thing to do is to eat 
more veggies and ditch the meat 
habit. The fast food industry can
not claim innocence as it takes an 
active role in worsening matters.
Despite the despicable disdain 
for consumers health, there is 
hope. As the fast food industry
handles its current crisis, now 
more than ever, there seems to 
be a window of opportunity.
Fast food chains have begun 
to offer vegetarian selections 
that expose Americans to an 
overall healthier way of living. 
Burger King introduced its BK 
Veggie at all of its nearly 8000 
U.S. locations in 2002, the single 
largest investment in vegetari
anism ever. McDonalds is exper
imenting with its McVeggie in 
select regions of North America, 
and might expand its sales if the 
trial run is successful.
Even Monster Thickburger and 
Big Mac advocates recognize the 
need for healthier food. Hardees 
introduced a
------------ sandwich with
only four grams 
of fat shortly af
ter the Monster 
Thickburger. 
McDonalds has 
led the way with 
salads and re
cently became 
the top purchaser 
of apples in the 
country.
If Americans 
must depend 
on fast food out 
of routine and 
convenience, at 
least they can 
now flirt with a 
healthier lifestyle 
altogether rather 
Whoppered tothan being 
death.
The fast food industry is full 
of ups and downs and is at a 
crossroads like never before. In 
the face of scrutiny, it can con
tinue to promote heart disease, 
or it can become a mainstream 
vehicle for healthful living with 
plentiful vegetarian options. I 
am worried by the likelihood 
of the former, but at least there 
is hope.
Michael Croland is the president 
of CMU Voices for Animals and 
enjoys promoting the Website 
GoVeg.com.
Campus has 
stalled out on 
issues of race
REFLECTIONS, from A7
tion of monocultural organizations. Secondly, 
there is not enough academic support for Afri
can-American studies and womens studies.
The first problem is one that is often ad
dressed but rarely analyzed. People seem to 
have an instinctive distaste for groups such as 
SPIRIT and ASA, but I always assumed that 
was just the status quos fear of organized 
minorities. These organizations play a fun
damental role for their members, providing 
community and a sense of solidarity.
While these groups play an important 
role, though, it is misguided to expect radical 
change from them. Groups dedicated to a sin
gle race or ethnicity will always be surpassed 
by those that fight for diversity by practicing 
it. Some of these cultural groups do a better 
job than others and all claim to be open to 
everyone, but most are dangerously homo
geneous. Yet Warner Hall and other leaders 
on campus include only these homogeneous 
groups in their programming and ignore those 
who are dedicated to both fighting for racial 
equality and practicing multiculturalism.
The second problem is simple. Its time 
for CMU to put its money where its mouth is 
and create an African-American studies de
partment and a womens studies department. 
Right now we have minors offered by other 
departments, but we need students on this 
campus who are here to study these complex 
and subtle issues.
Thirty years ago, students across the country 
demanded these departments in order to bet
ter understand the world around them. While 
to others this idea might seem antiquated, I 
believe these departments would provide this 
campus with students who could better ana
lyze and address many of our problems.
Its easy to draw students from each cultural 
organization, let them give a three-minute 
speech, and call it diversity. Its much harder 
to take these issues seriously, study them with 
the rigor they deserve, and create diverse, 
heterogeneous organizations. Its been a year 
of living easy; its time to bite the bullet and 
make some real changes.
Mark Egerman (mde@) is a fifth-year scholar 
who continues to worry about the composition 
of campus organizations. While it may be easy 
to organize among people who look like like 
you, it seems like too few students leave their 
comfort zones.
A note from 
The Tartans 
Ombudsman
NATRAT, from A7
not want to potentially reopen the wound that 
the Natrat created from last year too soon; a 
lot of those feelings are still present on campus, 
especially after recent events such as Shabazz 
brought them back to light. As to the future of 
the publication, he says, [The Tartan] doesnt 
need to fall back upon such stereotypes and 
bigotry in order to be funny.... I know that were 
capable of publishing something that we could 
be proud of; but we need to put a substantial 
amount of effort into doing so.
Alexander Meseguer, Editor-in-Chief last 
spring during the incident and current layout 
manager of the paper, shared his feelings on the 
matter: I have been pleasantly surprised by the 
progress [The Tartan has] made in the last year. 
The fact that The Tartan is participating in the 
SPIRIT fashion show is a testament to how far 
weve come in our relationship with the campus 
community. He continues, It saddens me that 
there wont be a joke issue of The Tartan this 
year. To a large extent, the newspaper has re
deemed itself as an indispensable information 
source for the student body and has earned the 
right to publish one.... If the standard of humor 
is set high, I feel no reason not to publish a joke 
issue in the future.
Whether the paper has earned the right to 
leave the satire penalty box is a decision that 
The Tartan and the community must make. I, 
simply as a member of this community, was 
anticipating the return of a satire edition this 
year, as I am a frequent customer of that form 
of humor. Furthermore, from an ombudsmans 
perspective, I believe that if anything can be 
a gauge of how far the organization has come 
in a year it would be creating an appropriate 
satire edition.
Good satire is a wonderful thing if it is done 
properly, and  to quote the Editor-in-Chief
 to do so, one must be serious about being 
funny. Perhaps the extra resources should have 
been put into the effort to make the Natrat 
possible; all of the reasons behind it could have 
been overcome with a concerted effort. Maybe 
this is a reflection of the desire to not be in the 
penalty box, but to wait for the opportune mo
ment to step back into the game.
So, alas, another year will pass without a 
followup to the controversy. However, it is 
important to remember that though a tradition 
may be a tradition, often it needs to be broken 
in order to rebuild something better, some
thing... funny.

Pirates will rely on pitching
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
With an offense that will strug
gle to score runs consistently, the 
Pirates will have to rely on strong 
pitching to win games. Youth 
is being served as this year the 
Bucs pitching staff is led by 24- 
year-old Oliver Perez and backed 
by a rotation that is just 28 years 
old on average. Conversely, the 
Yankees youngest starter is 29, 
and the average age of their big 
guns is over 35 years old. Here 
is a quick rundown of the young 
arms wholl be taking the mound 
for Pittsburgh in 2005.
Starter Oliver Perez  Perez, 
acquired in the trade that 
sent Brian Giles to San Diego, 
emerged as the staffs ace last 
year after a mediocre 2003. He 
had an earned run average of 
just 2.98 and struck out nearly
11 batters for every nine innings 
he pitched. However, thanks to 
meager run support on the offen
sive end, he managed only 12 
wins for the season. This year, 
hell be counted on to lead the 
Pirates in innings pitched and 
strikeouts again, and could be the 
teams best All-Star candidate.
Starter Kip Wells  Since he 
came to the team in 2002, fans 
have been waiting for Wells to 
put together a breakout season. 
He looked like he was on track in
2003 when he started 31 games 
and had an ERA of 3.28, but took 
a nosedive in 2004 due to injuries 
and other complications. This 
year, hell look to rebound from 
his five-win season and return to
the form that made him one of 
the leagues best prospects. He 
should contribute with 13 wins 
this year and return to his pre2004 form.
Starter Mark Redman  
Redman came to the Bucs in the 
trade that sent Jason Kendall 
to Oakland. He isnt much of a 
strikeout pitcher and hes been 
all over the league as this will 
be his fifth team in an eight-year 
career. However, he has valuable 
playoff experience as a member 
of the 2003 Florida Marlins team 
that won the World Series. His 
leadership will be key in the dugout, especially if the Bucs make it 
to the playoffs.
Starter Josh Fogg  Like 
Wells, Fogg has been revered by 
Pirates fans as one of the teams 
brightest stars since arriving in 
2002. However, hes struggled 
in the big leagues so far, never 
putting up much in the way of 
strikeouts, ERA, wins, or innings 
pitched. If he can put together 
a decent season, hell be a good 
number four starter, but after so 
much mediocrity, hes got to be 
considered a question mark for 
this team.
Starter Dave Williams  
Williams becomes the fifth start
er on this team because seem
ingly no one else wanted the 
position. The other candidates, 
Ryan Vogelsong and Zach Duke, 
are too young and inexperienced 
to take the spot, so it goes to 
the inconsistent Williams. Hes 
young, and could put together 
a solid season, but dont be sur
prised if hes sent to the bullpen 
by the end of the season in order
to get a younger guy in there.
Reliever Mike Gonzales  
Gonzales came out of nowhere to 
appear in 47 games last year and 
throw lights-out relief. Opposing 
hitters hit only .201 against the 
lefty, and hell be counted on 
to get out left-handed batters 
and keep games close in the late 
innings.
Reliever Ryan Vogelsong
 Vogelsong will likely shift 
between the bullpen and the 
starting rotation all season. Hell 
be a good fit in long relief when 
the team needs a pitcher to go 
three or more innings at a time.
Reliever Salomon Torres  
Torres, a righty, had a strong year 
in the bullpen last year, posting a 
2.64 ERA in 84 appearances. Hes 
a workhouse who eats up innings 
and keeps games under control. 
Hell get a lot of work this year, 
giving starters some rest.
Reliever Brian Meadows  
Meadows is a converted starter 
who will fill a similar role to 
Vogelsong. However, his extra 
experience brings an added 
dimension to the bullpen. Hes 
one of the elder statesmen and 
will be counted on to rally the 
young guys.
Closer Jose Mesa  When 
Mesa came to the Bucs, he was 
coming off a disastrous season 
with the Phillies where he was 
tagged for a 6.52 ERA. Last year, 
he put up 43 saves while cutting 
his ERA in half. Though his strike
out numbers arent what they 
used to be, hell be good for about 
30 saves and is the best candidate 
the team has for the closers role 
until a young guy can step up.
Bassett named athletic director
DIRECTOR, from A1
I look forward to continued 
success for Carnegie Mellon ath
letics with Susan at the helm. 
Potentially, this hiring could 
mean great changes in the athlet
ics department. She has a prov
en background of bringing big 
athletics to a small Division III 
school. In this situation, Bassett 
is moving to a larger market 
(Pittsburgh from Geneva, N.Y.) 
and will have a greater audience 
to which she can promote the 
Universitys sports programs. She 
also will have the help of the 
newly formed Athletics Council, 
a benefit that was not avail
able when Harvey was in office.
Bassett is coming to Carnegie 
Mellon in the middle of one of 
its best athletic seasons. Many of 
the teams are coming off nation
ally recognized campaigns, and 
hope to swing this momentum 
into next year.
However, she also goes from 
the primary school in a small 
market to arguable the smallest 
school in a big market. Suddenly, 
Bassett will have to compete 
with Division I programs like 
the University of Pittsburgh and 
Duquesne in promoting athlet
ics to a city that has three pro
fessional teams as well. The 
task could be daunting, but the 
reward is great. Imagine seeing 
Carnegie Mellon athletics in the
same headlines as the University 
of Pittsburgh.
With the recent wave of suc
cess and support for Carnegie 
Mellon sports and Bassetts past 
experience in finding room for 
new varsity teams, this campus 
may be looking at a whole new 
athletic landscape. If she is able to 
strengthen the support of the var
sity teams that already exist here, 
it may set the tone for new varsity 
sports to be added. Though it is 
too early to speculate on what is 
to come, the addition of an expe
rienced full-time athletics direc
tor like Susan Bassett appears 
to be one of the best moves the 
athletics department could have 
made.

second, the heavyweight womens 
pairs placing first and second, and 
the lightweight men and womens

Roller Hockey Tier I  The team 
was eliminated from playoffs with
5-3 loss to Robert Morris University 
in the semifinals. Trailing 4-2 in 
the final minute, the team pulled 
goalie Garret Jenkinson and scored 
with their man-up unit to close the 
gap to one. With under 45 seconds
to play, they controlled the puck 
and looked to have another manup opportunity, but an errant pass 
gave Robert Morris possession, and 
they scored an empty net goal to 
seal the victory. Goals were scored 
for Carnegie Mellon by Ben The 
Dude Karp, Jeff Hawaii Bourke, 
and Pete Beutler.
Roller Hockey Tier II  Advanced 
to the league playoff finals with a
6-3 victory over top-seeded Robert 
Morris University. Scoring was pro
vided by Jeff Miecznikowski, with 
four goals, as well as Brian Smith 
and Joe Plitz, with one goal each. 
Plitz also added two assists, and 
team captain Matt Palastro had one 
assist.

Roller hockey bows out of playoffs 3-5
is happy to see the influx of young 
kids. The team has a lot of youth 
but everyone is improving greatly 
with each competition, he said.
Russel Verbofsky, Mark Davis, 
Mike Bridenbaugh and Kiley 
Williams are all underclassmen 
that have performed at a level 
far beyond what their experience 
suggests. In the 400m hurdles, 
first-year Kiley Williams finished 
with a time of 56.88. The talent 
of this young athlete proved to be 
high enough to place him in third 
overall for the event, scoring six 
points for the team.
The mens relay teams have set 
high goals for the season and the 
results to date have shown that 
these goals are quite attainable. 
Nik Bonaddio explained the plan 
for the season and what they 
hope to achieve.
After our record-break
ing performance at the UAA 
Indoor Tournament, we have 
been focused on making a run 
at nationals. Watching the care 
that has been taken in prepara
tion for these relays shows the 
high level of commitment the 
Tartans have.
The Tartans 4x800m relay 
team had quite an afternoon on 
Saturday, after breaking both the 
stadium and meet records with a 
recorded time of 7:59.4. Despite 
this exceptional performance, 
the 4x800 team placed second 
overall, losing to a Duquesne 
squad that broke their own meet 
record by over six seconds.
After breaking the school 
record at the UAA indoor track 
championships, the Tartans 
4x400m relay team posted a topnotch time, finishing in 3:19.42. 
These results allowed them to 
edge out Duquesne University for 
the top place in the event. These 
two teams proved themselves as 
the best in the region, beating 
out the third-place team by over 
six seconds apiece. The Tartans 
will look to keep this momentum 
going into the season and send 
their 4x400 team to Nationals.
In the mens 10km run, soph
omore Bridenbaugh secured a 
first-place finish after breaking 
the meet record and recording 
a time of 32:39.9. A continua
tion of this over the course of the 
season should prove the high 
level of competition that the 
Tartans will bring to every meet.
Bonaddio has had an excep
tional career at Carnegie 
Mellon as a 400m runner. With 
record-setting performances and 
first-place finishes becoming 
commonplace, he is a threat to 
each team the Tartans face. On 
Saturday, he posted a first-place 
time of 49.06 in the 400m dash.
Next week, the teams will 
travel for the Washington & 
Jefferson University Invitational 
Saturday.

6-1. In the final set, however, 
Staloch cut down on her errors 
and easily closed out the match.
Staloch said of her win, I 
think at first I was intimidated by 
them being Division I scholarship 
players, but Mona played very 
well in doubles and winning that 
made it just another match for 
me. Still, it was of course not an 
easy match.
Even with their victories at 
the top the Tartans could not 
overcome the Panthers superior 
Pitt won at both second 
doubles 8-0, and simi
larly rolled through the back of 
CMUs lineup, winning at posi
tions three through six. Still, the 
Tartans had some chances, par
ticularly at five and six singles 
where Grace Hwang and Kavita 
Shah each managed to win a set. 
Shah, in particular, had some 
chances to pull out her match, 
could not convert on any of 
big points late in the decid
ing set.
Her teammate, Mai Otsuka, 
describes that match as just one 
that could have gone either way. 
She says, Its good to play with 
good teams and get better, but 
I think we are right with them; 
just a couple of matches went the 
wrong way. They are Division I 
but were not scared of them or 
anything, and next year we are 
going to beat them. Just not a 
very good day this time.
Though losing is never easy, 
the team stands to gain a lot after 
competing with a Division I titan. 
The team will look to build on the 
confidence gained Wednesday, 
and carry that confidence through 
the rest of the regular season. For 
Carnegie Mellon, it is now back 
to the grind of Division III tennis, 
where they will continue to be 
one of the top teams to beat in 
the country.
Though they are currently 15 th, 
their standing will likely increase 
after regular season victories over 
nationally ranked University of 
Mary Washington and Wheaton 
College-Illinois. The teams 
only two Division III losses have 
come to top 20 teams. Next, 
they play this Monday against 
the University of California and 
then return to action April 10 at 
Swarthmore College.

Carnegie Mellons Tier I roll
er hockey squad came up short 
Thursday night with a loss in 
the semifinals of the Western 
Pennsylvania Collegiate Inline 
Hockey League playoffs. The 
5-3 loss to top-seeded Robert 
Morris University (RMU) stopped 
CMUs eight-game winning streak 
and ended CMUs playoff run, 
concluding their 2005 season.
The contest featured a duel 
between two outstanding goaltenders, with CMU sophomore 
goalie Garrett Jenkinson match
ing the outstanding play of unde
feated RMU goaltender Mike 
Alexander. Both netminders 
made outstanding saves through
out the game and put on quite a 
show for the large crowd of fans 
in attendance.
Despite the stellar goaltending, 
RMU managed to score first and 
took the lead with a top-shelf 
slap shot midway through the 
first period. CMU answered back 
when Ben Karp scored a short 
while later, on an assist by firstyear defenseman Matt Salac. This 
was the only first period scor
ing  neither team could put 
anything past the opposing goal
keeper.
In the second period CMU 
still could not manage to take 
the lead, and a Tartans defensive
lapse resulted in another RMU 
tally. Trailing 1-2, the Tartans 
again rebounded with a Jeff 
Hawaii Bourke wrist shot that 
found the net through a screen of 
defenders. Unfortunately for 
CMU, the tie would be broken 
again by a questionable in-andout RMU goal before the period 
came to an end with the score 3-2 
in Robert Morris favor. Despite 
the presence of an opposing play
er in the goalies crease - a rules 
violation - the goal counted.
Entering the third period down 
by a goal, CMU fought hard to 
even the game with a flurry of 
scoring chances, but instead gave 
up another RMU score. Midway 
through the period, sophomore 
forward Mike Darraghs outstand
ing efforts appeared to have put 
CMU back in the game with a nice 
wrist shot score, but instead the 
goal was disallowed due to the 
net being dislodged. At this point, 
CMU could not seem to catch a 
break, and their continued efforts 
were mostly fruitless, with the 
only exception being a too-littletoo-late goal by Pete Beutler with
20 seconds left. Though the tally 
cut Robert Morriss lead to to 
just one goal, there was simply 
not enough time for the Tartans 
to put together a well planned 
attack. Though they controlled 
possession after the faceoff, an 
errant pass put the puck back 
in Robert Morris control. An

The Western Pennsylvania 
Track and Field Championships 
of 2005 were held on April 2. The 
Carnegie Mellon track team host
ed the Championship meet. This 
competition pitted some of the 
most competitive area universi
ties against each other in an all 
day track meet. With participants 
representing Division I track and 
field, the level of competition is 
traditionally elevated.
Of the 14 teams that competed, 
the women placed sixth overall 
in the 20 total events. The excep
tional performance of several 
athletes propelled the team to a 
strong finish.
In the womens shot put, Becky 
Metier continued to demonstrate 
her ability to perform by throwing
11.03 meters, which was enough 
for sixth place and three team 
points. Despite a strong showing 
in the other weights events, the 
womens team failed to pick up 
any points in their other events.
The 4x100m relay team 
showed how strong they were 
by placing fifth, with a time of 
52.95, against very stiff competi
tion. The other womens relay 
teams were unable to duplicate 
the strong showings that they 
have had at other meets.
In the 5000m run, Drea 
Garvue set a personal record 
with a time of 18:43.6, placing 
second. The team continued to 
show their strength in mid to 
long distance events with Jocelyn 
Sikoras second place perfor
mance in the 1500m run. She 
crossed the line with 4:53.44 
on the clock. Freshman Shauna 
Ormon achieved the only points 
scored through short distance by 
placing 10th overall in the 400m 
hurdle event.
The mens track team placed 
fifth overall out of the 15 par
ticipants that competed in 
the Western Pennsylvania
Championships. These results 
have matched the record-setting 
pace that the men have set over 
the course of the 2005 season.
The Tartans weight throwing 
team has had considerable suc
cess in the indoor season and most 
of that has carried over into the 
outdoor season. Unfortunately, 
with UAA champion Tom Matta 
suffering from strep throat, the 
team scored only one point in the 
throwing events.
Senior Matt Dalka continued 
to showcase his talent in the High 
Jump by clearing 1.83 meters (six 
feet) and walking away with a 
seventh-place finish, scoring two 
points for the team standings. 
He looks to carry the strength of 
a UAA Championship in the high 
jump in to the new season.
Though the Tartans top per
formers consist of seasoned 
veterans, there is a consider
able underclassman presence.

over top-seeded Robert Morris. 
Jeff JC Smooth Miecznikowski

period goals and a total of four in
the game. The squad advances to

Following their impressive per
formance at home Wednesday 
afternoon against the University 
of Pittsburgh, the 15th-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon womens ten
nis team proved that in addition 
to dominating their Division III 
competition, they can also battle 
closely with scholarship-laden 
Division I powerhouses. In the
David versus Goliath matchup  
played out on a beautiful spring 
day that brought a giant ring of 
spectators to the courts  the 
Tartans outperformed all expec
tations, but still fell 6-3.
The duo of Amy Staloch and 
Mona Iyer, the second-ranked 
doubles team in all of Division III 
tennis, set the tone for a competi
tive match by routinely disposing 
of Pitts Annie Davies and Becky 
Emmers 8-3. In singles as well, 
Iyer and Staloch were ungalled
by their Division I opponents, and 
both won hard-fought three-set 
matches. Iyer blitzed Emmers 
with a barrage of flat, powerful 
ground strokes that eventually 
wore down the Panthers number 
two player. Stalochs match, by 
contrast, played out more like a 
chess contest.
After Staloch rolled through 
the first set on pure power, Davies 
upset her timing with a mix of 
short slices and rolling topspin 
lobs that gave her the second set
Mona Iyer couldnt lose Wednesday, winning in both singles and doubles competition against Pitt.

Improv Troupe Delivers Laughs
No Parking Players move their act to Station Square
When you launder money, Gerrit Betz asked 
the audience, contorting his face into a quizzical 
mug, do you use Tide or Gain?
On Wednesday, Betz, a sophomore ethics, 
history, and public policy major, performed at 
the Green Room in Station Square with four 
of his fellow No Parking Players: Alex Grubb, 
a sophomore computer science major, Brian 
Gray, a junior information systems major, Scott 
Dai, a senior computer science major, and Josh 
Hailpem, a junior computer science major and 
the groups artistic director. At the time of his 
supposed money-laundering ineptitude, Betz 
and his comrades were doing their best to come 
up with the 10 best examples of incompetent 
criminals.
basic form of performance that you can get. 
Theres no construct around it  just go up 
there and be entertaining. Thats so freeing, and 
thats why improv is so rewarding. There really 
are no rules.
One of the things that sets the No Parking 
Players (NPP) apart from an ordinary improv 
troupe is their all-encompassing approach to 
the art. Not only do they perform their shows in 
the University Center, but they also teach. Every 
Thursday and Sunday, the troupe hosts free 
improv workshops in Baker Hall 235A, where 
any and all interested improvers can, according 
to Josh Hailpern, learn, relax, have a good 
time, and laugh. [We] let you get all the facets 
of improv that are entertaining.
Courtney Kochuba, a sophomore English 
major, enjoys NPPs free shows. Theyre a very 
talented group of college students that go above 
and beyond what a lot of professional groups 
do in performances, she said. They use their 
intelligence and humor to create something 
thats funny and is a great break for busy college 
students. Indeed, NPPs free shows usually 
draw crowds with standing room only.
But the benefits of improv extend beyond a good 
belly laugh. The practice can actually hone ones 
argumentative skills and ability to think quickly 
under pressure. Improv studies interactions
 the things that people do and why they do 
them, said Betz. It teaches your brain to think 
on its feet, and always come up with solutions, 
no matter how crazy they are. Betz pointed out 
that your life is unscripted.
According to Hailpern, Improv isnt something 
thats limited to a game or a scene. Its so much 
deeper. If you think about it, thats what good 
professors do. Its the ability to change yourself 
to make people engaged, and to get people to 
listen. Its a skill thats really a part of every 
aspect of your life.
Hailpern capped off the troupes night at the 
Green Room with his own stab at one of the 
top 10 lamest criminals. He took center stage 
and stood slouching for a few moments. Then, 
glancing over his shoulder at an imaginary sign, 
he scoffed to the audience, No loitering? F 
that.

Why Sequels Suck
Or, how I learned to stop worrying and blame executives
A MEMO TO THE DIRECTOR
Congratulations! Your film has done admirably at the box 
office. Your combination of (breathtaking effects/clever 
writing/wicked action scenes/biting social commentary; 
circle one) and (breathtaking effects/clever writing/wicked 
action scenes/biting social commentary; circle one) has led 
the producers to greenlight a sequel. Please begin (eviscerat
ing the films soul/firing every original actor/hiring a re
tarded monkey to write the script/slashing the production 
budget/obscenely inflating the production budget/market
ing the movie to angsty 12-year-olds; circle one) in prepara
tion for the sequels release.
Cheers,
Corporate
So maybe movie studios arent always that point-blank 
about their plans to create sequels. Really, though, if you 
look at all the spectacularly bad sequels that have come 
out in the past decade or so, it wouldnt be any stretch of 
the imagination to see memos like the one above being 
sent out every few months by production companies.
Sometimes it seems like movie studio execs simply have 
no idea what theyre producing. Certainly, the box office 
success of one movie does not guarantee the success of 
a sequel. There are so many variables that go into what 
makes a good movie that its nearly impossible to capture 
all of them and repeat the success a second time.
Take the recent release of The Ring 2. You may have no
ticed the less-than-positive review in last weeks Pillbox
Courtesy of Hollywood.com
The plot of The Ring 2 was a dismal disappointment in com
parison to the first installment of the Japanese horror flick.
 the film had no possibility of living up to the original, 
which was a highly regarded and well-executed movie. 
Of course, The Ring 2 has been performing well at the box 
office, but that is more an effect of having no other even 
marginally entertaining movies in theaters right now 
and especially because its only PG-13. Even considering 
that, this movie should never have been made. In fact, 
The Ring 2s Japanese counterpart, Ringu 2, was only 
created because people didnt like the original sequel 
(titled Rasen, or spiral).
A lot of sequels dont even get the restrained respect that 
The Ring 2 is starting to get. For example, take the release 
of Son of the Mask earlier this year. Even on the films own 
merits and if the movie were a completely original film 
devoid of franchise ties, it would have been a miserable 
failure. The film cost $84 million to produce and even 
more to market, and to date (in the month and a half its 
been out) it has made just over $25 million worldwide. 
This is a perfect example of the worst way to go about 
a sequel: Not only did the production company take a 
franchise that has been dormant for 11 years, except for a 
mildly entertaining cartoon show, but they also got rid of 
the original director, original screenwriter, original cast, 
and even the original feel of the movie. In fact, Son of the 
Mask was produced and marketed as, a kids movie  the 
inheritors of the enchanted mask are a dog and a baby. 
Stunning filmmaking, indeed.
And then there was the brilliant idea of making bad se
quels to already bad movies. Elektra, released earlier this 
year, was a sequel to the mediocre Daredevil. No one ex
pected the production company to spin off a relatively 
uninteresting character (who actually ends up dying in 
Daredevil) into her own movie  even though they did 
give it a hefty budget and kept the star. The production 
company simply couldnt solve the problem of an uninter
esting story and poor acting. The producers of the movie 
havent yet disclosed how much they spent to make the 
movie, but its only made $52 million worldwide  a pal
try amount for any Marvel Comics film.
There are exceptions to bad sequel syndrome, of course. 
X-Men 2 and Spiderman 2 both kept the original cast, the 
original director, and the spirit of the film, and both were 
regarded to be great sequels. Even The Italian Job and 
Oceans 11, while not proper sequels, were both remakes 
of older films and kept the spirit of the originals alive, 
while updating the films to make them relevant and en
joyable to modern audiences.
Fortunately, sometimes it is possible to redeem a fran
chise. The abysmally rubber-nipple-tastic Batman & Robin 
was definitely a low point in superhero movie history. ArCourtesy of yahoo.com
Audiences hope that the Batman Begins sequel will be better 
than previous iterations, like Batman & Robin.
nold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, wearing a chromed 
bondage suit, was something no one should ever have 
been subjected to. The film was horrible enough to end 
Alicia Silverstones career (the biggest movie shes been 
in since then was Scooby Doo 2). However, salvation may 
be coming in the form of creepy tough guy Christian 
Bale, who is taking the role of a young Bruce Wayne in 
the upcoming Batman Begins. The film has been testing 
very positively with critics and fans at prescreenings, so 
there is hope that it will bring the franchise back to its 
respected roots.
In a few rare cases, sequels have done even better than 
the original movies. Die Hard: With a Vengeance, the third 
film in that franchise, which went back to the director and 
yippee-ki-yay attitude of the original, became vasdy 
more popular than its predecessor, though not quite as 
highly grossing.
The spirit of a film is its heart, its soul, and its ability to 
perform at the box office. Too often, in the rush to make 
a quick buck, movie executives lose sight of the movies 
original spirit and tend to go for whatever will get the 
most attention. With marketing costs ever rising, the 
pinch to squeeze money from the public is getting stron
ger  and unfortunately for moviegoers, the easiest way 
to do that is by making horrible sequels in already exist
ing franchises. On behalf of the production companies 
that make these horrible sequels: my apologies.

Vegan and vegetarian lifestyles on campus
Dining Services tries to accommodate students with special dietary needs
Vegetarian and vegan diets can be a 
challenge. There are a large number 
of vegetarian and vegan consumers on 
campus who have to find a way to eat the 
food offered at CMU without compromising 
their own diet choices. Erica Rayfield, a 
spokeswoman and chef behind the scenes 
in the UC, asserts that Dining Services has 
done what they can to make sure that every 
student is offered all their nutritional needs 
as gently as possible. According to Rayfield, 
the interest in vegetarian and vegan foods is 
a relatively new phenomenon, and Carnegie 
Mellon is trying to embrace vegetarian and 
vegan ways of life.
Since vegetarians do not eat meat, and 
vegans do not eat any sort of animal 
product, vendors on campus have to 
be sure that their food is up to par with 
students dietary expectations. The 
larger vendors, such as those in the UC 
or in Posner Hall, offer a wide array of 
different foods to satisfy the vegetarian 
or vegan palate. Rayfield and the campus 
vendors recognize that the vendors in the 
UC would gladly make whatever foods 
that students ask for. In places such as 
Skibo and S Seor, vegan and vegetarian 
menus proudly display what options are 
open to the students. Gingers Deli offers 
a vegetable wrap and a vegetable burger,
Asiana in Newell-Simon has a vegetable 
and tofu entree, and even the Original Hot 
Dog Shop will provide a veggie burger to 
anyone who asks for it.
If Dining Services doesnt have what you 
are looking for, though, the trucks on 
campus are a must for any student craving 
vegetables. Out of the five trucks typically 
located on Tech Street, every one of them 
serves a variety of vegetarian options. Four out of these 
five vegetarian options are actually vegan, as well.
The smaller vendors, such as the Gingers Express 
in Baker Hall and the Zebra Lounge in CFA, are not 
as accommodating to students with special dietary 
concerns. Instead of offering nutritious food for vegans 
and vegetarians, the smaller vendors on campus focus 
on pastries and teas to help consumers get through their 
classes. However, the vendors dont realize that even 
these dainty dishes are not vegan.
Vegetarians and vegans can find more dining options at
the larger vendors on campus, although eating at the 
same restaurants can get tiring. Dining Services strives 
to make sure that ample food is provided to satisfy 
the desires of students, but sometimes the vegan and 
vegetarian options lack variety. The lack of variety at large 
on-campus vendors raises the question of whether or not 
first-years should be required to stay on the meal plan. 
The lack of variety in food options is especially frustrating 
since students are spending close to $26,000 a year just to 
eat the same two or three meals day after day after day.
The fact is that most vegan options only became available 
in the past year and a half. Michael Croland, the president
of Voices for Animals at CMU, reflected 
that vegetarian foods, such as the two 
salad bars, the soy milk options, as 
well as the non-dairy smoothies, did 
not exist at all when he was a first-year 
here at CMU. When questioned about 
what efforts Dining Services has been 
making to accommodate vegans and 
vegetarians, he said, They really are 
trying, I believe, to make it easier.
The move toward a healthier and 
more environmentally friendly diet is 
a relatively new occurrence. Croland 
discussed a survey conducted last 
October by Aramark, a popular food 
provider, that found almost 24 percent 
of students nationwide indicated that 
vegan foods were important to them 
(full details can be found here: www. 
aramark.com/press_releases.htm). 
With the rise of vegan diets among 
college students, it is important that 
students work to make sure not only 
that vegan options are available on 
campus, but also that the meat and 
dairy products used by Dining Services 
come from free-range farms.
Dining Services is adapting to the new 
demands by ensuring that vendors 
follow guidelines that embrace the 
vegan way of life. These include basic 
sanitary concerns, such as using 
separate cutting boards for vegan and 
vegetarian foods, and wearing and 
changing gloves often. Croland stated 
that if a student ever feels that their 
food is unacceptable, he or she should 
simply inquire about the processing of 
their food. Croland himself has inquired 
about his food many times, and claimed 
that it was never really a problem.
Dining Services distributes newsletters and conducts 
daily meetings concerning vegetarian, vegan, and kosher 
meals to make sure that every student feels comfortable in 
their environment away from home. Even though vegan 
and vegetarian foods are a relatively new commodity on 
our campus, students can always find vegan options, even 
if there is a lack of variety, simply by asking the chefs.

This past Thursday night, a small group of about 15 
students filed through the doors of Mudge House and 
into the piano lounge. After getting settled, a speaker 
introduced herself personally to all of the students, 
asking their names and years, as well as where they 
were from. Esther Bush, president and CEO of the 
Urban League of Pittsburgh, spoke to the students 
gathered there about the importance of commu
nity activism on both local and global levels, par
ticularly in regard to the unjustifiable differences 
among races.
Bush was brought to speak to the Carnegie 
Mellon University community as part of a 
traditionally second semester, student-run 
series of lectures called Local Currents. Local 
Currents tends to act as a smaller semesterlong followup to first semesters more globally 
focused Carnegie Lecture Series. In spring 
of 2002, student Aria Thomases, then the 
Community Advisor for Mudge, began to 
bring lecturers to campus to talk about her 
passion, the environment. Through the 
years, the series has expanded to include a 
variety of topics including homelessness, 
abortion, and the death penalty.
This year, Mudge housefellow Niloo 
Sobhani asked a Carnegie Lecture Se
ries regular, Ryan Menefee, to orga
nize the series of speakers for spring. 
Menefee, president of the New 
House Council, works with Sobhani 
and Mudge RA Kate Cummings to 
bring high-profile locals passion
ed^11 ate about community activism to
campus. Menefee says of the lec
ture series, Its a forum for open 
discussion, but also a way for 
people to connect with others 
with their interests. Its about 
the environment, the arts, soveiet ^ cial justice.
Each speaker that comes 
will address another aspect 
of community activism 
on a local level. Hearing 
these people speak may 
help students, especially 
those newer to the area, 
see what Pittsburgh has 
to offer. Menefee says, 
For me, Im really in
terested in doing Local 
Currents because it
gives me a chance to show people who arent from Pitts
burgh that these are the opportunities you have. These 
are great ways to make connections.
During her lecture, Bush pinpointed the goal of the en
tire series: Im pleased to have the opportunity to speak 
up and speak out. She left the audience with a wealth of 
new information about social justice or injustice, about 
getting involved in ones community, and about speaking 
out about ones passions. The environment readily fa
cilitated interaction with the speaker, and will hopefully 
continue to do so throughout this series.
Local Currents will continue to host interesting speakers 
throughout the semester. On this Thursday, Debra Lane 
of the Steinbrenner Institute will talk about the Green 
Initiative. The following week, on Tuesday, April 19, 
Jeffrey Dorsey of the Penn Avenue Arts Initiative will 
speak. Each lecture is held in the Mudge piano lounge 
at 7:30 pm. Also related is Creating Global Citizens: A 
Faculty Forum, an event on this Tuesday at 5:30 pm in 
the Connan Room. This forum will be an opportunity to 
discuss the potential of broadening the undergraduate 
curricular experience, as opposed to a continued 
specialized, and perhaps narrow, current curriculum.

Campus considers taking Green Pledge
Students discuss measures to be environmentally conscious after college
Carnegie Mellon has, in recent times, visibly stepped up 
its environmental efforts by offering recycling education 
programs and building energy-efficient dormitories. On 
April 1, the University not only received the Governors 
Award for Environmental Excellence, but also organized 
a panel discussion to install a Graduation Pledge to en
courage Carnegie Mellon graduates to implement envi
ronmentally conscious thinking in their daily lives.
The discussion, held in McConomy Auditorium, was led 
by Indira Nair, Vice Provost for Education; Ryan England, 
president of Earth; Erik Michaels-Ober, Student Body 
President; and Barb Kviz, the environmental coordinator 
for the University. About 15 other people attended the 
discussion, offering their own input and giving the event 
a more intimate feel.
The discussion was kicked off with the presentation of
the pledge itself: I,________, pledge to explore and
take into account the social and environmental con
sequences of any job I consider and will try to improve 
the aspects of any organization for which I work. The 
pledge was open to modification, since it serves only as a 
model and is used in numerous other schools. The model 
pledge was started in 1987, and since then it has expand
ed to over 100 schools around the country.
Some universities have given the Graduation Pledge a 
particularly visible role on their campuses; Harvard or
ganized a series of panel discussions about conscious ca
reer choices for its students, and Princeton managed to 
get 80 percent of its senior class to sign the pledge.
A question quickly arose over whether or not the pledge 
should be given at CMUs graduation or at convocation. As 
discussed, if all first-years were introduced to the Pledge 
as soon as they entered campus, it could easily be incor
porated into their education. A sense of responsibility for 
the ideals of the Pledge would thus exist not only when 
a graduate enters the work force, but also during his or 
her time in college. Some requirements, such as atten
dance at service events or panel discussions, could even 
be instituted for those who wished to sign the Graduation 
Pledge at the end of their college careers. Simply taking 
the pledge doesnt mean anything, said Michaels-Ober.
The panelists and attendees also discussed the mean
ing of the Pledge and whether its presence reflects prog
ress or lack of progress. They questioned the motives for 
Carnegie Mellon instituting the Pledge. Is it because we 
want to make environmental consciousness more visible 
or because it does not exist on a large enough scale?
While Carnegie Mellon is consistently moving in a more 
environmentally-friendly direction, some projects on 
campus, such as those funded by large corporations, can
not always take environmental issues into consideration. 
Some attendees suggested that an ethics course be made 
a requirement for all undergraduates, including those 
with scientific or technical majors. Michaels-Ober hoped
that a student organization would be started specifically 
to implement the pledge and organize related service op
portunities and panel discussions.
Seniors interested in signing the Graduation Pledge will 
get a chance to sign it as part of this years Earth Day fes
tivities on April 22. These students will wear green rib
bons on their gowns during commencement to indicate 
the promise they have made. In the future, the panelists 
hope to include more extensive honoring of these se
niors, including a celebratory dinner. According to Nair, 
she hopes to institute the opportunity for students to 
do an exercise that would test their behavior in certain 
situations and thus show how environmentally and so
cially conscious they already are, and what mistakes they 
might be making in their daily routines.
Nair was not sure if having the majority of the senior class 
sign the Pledge would be a good idea. There is a fine line, 
she said, between encouraging students to be a part of 
the Pledge and having students sign it without a sense 
of commitment to it. You have to come to the decision 
[over time], Nair said.

Discussion on GLBT portrayals in advertising
Mike Wilke speaks on typical stereotypes, hetero discomfort, and hope for the future
You click on the TV and watch as an attractive young 
woman gets ready: racy shots of her garter belt and thigh 
high stockings, even a corset.
When she enters a restaurant, the men gawk at her. The 
television screen flashes to shots of her in just her under
garments  extrapolations made by the men. When she 
reaches her table at the restaurant, the text on the tele
vision screen wonders: Do men deserve it? When the 
woman sits down and kisses the woman sitting beside 
her, full on the lips, the screen answers: No.
Youve just witnessed what Mike Wilke calls a positive 
portrayal of gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender 
(GLBT) people in commercials. Why positive? Well, as 
Wilke explained last Wednesday, in commercials similar 
to the one described above that came from Boisvert 
Lingerie, GLBT couples are shown together, happy, and 
there are no negative reactions from the surrounding
people in the ad. The Boisvert Lingerie commercial comes 
from France and would seem very scandalous on U.S. 
airwaves, as Wilkes website www.commercialcloset.com 
acknowledges in its description of the advertisement.
Wilke began his lecture with an explanation of how he 
came to have a collection of over 2000 commercials por
traying GLBT people. These advertisements are all over 
the range of portrayals. Some are extremely positive, 
such as ads by MTV that portray gay and lesbian couples 
alongside heterosexual couples, while others are ex
tremely negative, depicting worn stereotypes just to get 
a laugh.
Wilke talked about his theories for what makes an other
wise negative portrayal more like a neutral one. In one 
ad for Salon Selectives, an overtly gay hairstylist is com
plaining that he is out of a job since women began to turn 
to Salon Selectives for products. The reason Wilke be
lieved that this commercial was going beyond the GLBT 
stereotype was because the commercial was funny for 
other reasons. Viewers see the stylist attempting to work 
as a mechanicand failing miserably. Wilke said that by 
making the stylists incompetence funny, the commercial 
did better than a purely stereotypical portrayal of a flam
boyant gay male.
Advertisers are more aware of politically incorrect stereo
types, said Wilke, but they do not always take into account 
the stereotypes of the GLBT community as seriously as 
they would with racial or religious stereotypes. Whereas 
corporations are very conscious of advertisements that 
portray stereotypes of race, they may not be as sensitive 
to those that portray stereotypes of sexuality.
Wilke now speaks with many of the companies that 
run or want to run advertisements with a GLBT theme.

Worth listening to: Becks album Guero a success
The many faces of this veteran artist revealed on his latest release
Throughout his remarkable recording career, Beck Han
sen has embraced many roles as a musician: lo-fi indie 
slacker, pop-culture miner, noise rocker, R&B loverman, 
and on his most recent outing  2002s Sea Change 
heartbroken balladeer. Admired by critics and hipsters 
alike, his abstract lyricism and range of musical styles 
have produced a body of work characterized by a stead
fast refusal to settle into a single style for long. With this 
weeks release of his latest effort, Guero, however, Beck 
for the first time seems to have settled into the role of 
simply being Beck. The result is an album that, while not 
quite on par with his groundbreaking mid-90s master
pieces, is still a fine listen full of the stylistic changes that 
have kept Beck at the forefront of alternative pop for over 
a decade.
For Guero, Beck has reunited with production team the 
Dust Brothers, the duo responsible for his acclaimed 
1996 Odelay disc. More than anything, this move signi
fies that Beck is perhaps for the first time aiming for a 
return to form; though, for an artist who embraces so 
many different styles, pinning that form down is some
what difficult.
Though not as sample-happy as some of the Dust Broth
ers previous efforts, the beats are memorable and bring 
a welcome energy to the proceedings. In terms of the 
flow and overall vibe of the album, Guero does resemble 
Odelay to some extent, at least more so than his other
albums. Still, there are almost 10 years between the two, 
and Guero is predictably less wacky and far-flung, and 
more earnest than Odelay.
From the outset Beck establishes that, rather than the 
thematic consistency of his last few records, eclecticism 
will rule the day on Guero. Opening track and lead sin
gle E-Pro is a straight-ahead guitar rocker that rides 
along on the formidable beat from the Beastie Boys So 
Whatcha Want and an irresistible na na na na chorus. 
From there, Beck settles into the relaxed Latin-inflected 
groove of Qu Onda Guero, which finds our hero roam
ing around L.A. and narrating in Spanglish stream-ofconsciousness. Its by far the most fun track on the CD, 
vividly painting a picture of the scene in the listeners 
mind. The wistful pop-rock of Girl (complete with a 
Nintendo-influenced intro) then melts into the melan
choly shuffle of Missing and the pulsating Black Tam
bourine. Its an inviting suite of diverse songs that still 
mesh well together and, just as importantly, showcase 
Becks solid songwriting. The rest of the album follows a 
similar blueprint, though the overall mood becomes less 
spirited as the record progresses.
Working with the Dust Brothers clearly brings out the 
best in Beck on Guero. The tracks Broken Drum and 
Farewell Ride, which address losing a friend and his 
own mortality, respectively, were written and recorded 
without their assistance and are easily the low points of
an otherwise consistent record. Though the second half 
is a little flatter than the first, a few hidden gems do await 
patient listeners. An inspired collaboration with the White 
Stripes Jack White, Go It Alone, is perhaps the albums 
highlight. Ever the minimalist, White contributes a dirty 
bass riff over a loping hip-hop beat (plus handclaps!) 
that, along with Becks layered vocals, compose the entire 
track. Apparendy, White will only perform on songs 
featuring two or fewer instruments, but the approach 
is effective here. The penultimate track, Rental Car, 
with its driving classic-rock chorus and nonsense female 
vocal break, shows up in time to add some spice to the 
proceedings. Still, by the time the album closes with the 
reflective Emergency Exit, some of the highlights of the 
disc may have already been forgotten.
Beck has mellowed a bit in his old age  its telling that 
no random noise is hidden after the final song on Guero 
as in previous efforts  but his creativity and recordmaking skills are still ahead of most artists. The main 
flaw of Guero is simply the high standards set by Becks 
remarkable back catalog, where even an album as in
triguing and diverse as this can seem a little dated. Ten 
years from now, Guero will still have a welcome place in 
my record collection next to Odelay and Mellow Gold, but 
its doubtful it will be pulled from the shelf quite as often 
as they will.

men driving around town, some in the GLBT community 
saw the two as a couple, even though they didnt make 
any physical contact during the commercial. The reason 
for the interpretation, Wilke suggested, might have been 
that the commercial was aired during the premiere of 
Ellen. Commercials like the VW one that contain imag
es that could be interpreted as representations of GLBT 
people are what prompted Wilke to coin the phrase gay 
vague.
Were looking to see ourselves reflected in the media, 
said Wilke, noting a possible reason that commercials 
and other media forms are being interpreted as possible 
representations of GLBT people. However, he noted that 
when he polled people who searched his website, most 
agreed that they would rather see open marketing to
wards the GLBT community than gay vague advertise
ments.
Some trends in GLBT advertising are pretty disturbing, 
as Wilkes lecture pointed out. Only a third of the 
commercials Wilke has in his database portray lesbians, 
and among those the overwhelming portrayal is of 
lipstick lesbians. Wilke believes that the appearance 
of lipstick lesbians is primarily geared towards straight
men, and often straight men have a presence in such 
commercials. A portrayal Wilke has never seen is the 
diesel dyke stereotype  basically a lesbian who is 
more masculine in appearance and demeanor.
Other trends are actually very promising for GLBT 
people. Wilke finds that MTV has had a consistent
Joanna Bresee/Art Staff
campaign of advertisements that show GLBT people. 
Among those shown at the screening were two MTV 
ads, one anti-discrimination ad, and one that showed a 
gay and a lesbian couple experiencing the same things 
as a hetero couple in the ad, such as quarrels and love 
of music. MTV and other corporations, such as John 
Hancock, have placed portrayals of gays or lesbians in 
their advertisements to speak to the diversity of their 
audience, according to Wilke.
The trends in advertisements that portray GLBT people 
seem to have a bright side. There are still ads that show 
discomfort, such as one Heineken ad that shows two 
men becoming extremely uncomfortable with one 
another after their hands brush. Recentiy, GLBT people 
are beginning to show up in commercials as part of a 
larger situation, said Wilke. The portrayals of the GLBT 
community that show them as everyday people in the 
same situations as anyone else are one step away from 
ads that focus on stereotypes to create humor and a fair 
portrayal of GLBT people in the media.

Move away or stay? Reasons to live on campus
Despite the frustrations of Room Draw, students should stay in the dorms for a sense of community
Where you live is just as important as the classes you take. 
While our classes help us discover what we want to do 
with our life, our room choices help us discover the type 
of people we are compatible to live with. Living on campus 
gets a bad rap sometimes, and undoubtedly there are 
certain disadvantages to dorm life. But living on campus 
is an essential part of the college experience, and one of 
the most valuable experiences that students can have at 
college. It's ironic, then, that frustrations with Housing 
Services and Room Draw can have have a detrimental 
effect  pushing students away from the dorms and into 
off-campus living.
The on-campus community
Unfortunately for students who live off campus, they miss 
the best part of dorm life: its sense of community. Dorms 
close to campus usually have multiple lounges where 
students can mingle and study together. Communities 
here form almost involuntarily, so students who get 
along with their floormates have a pseudo-family close to 
school.
Sonal Mayekar started her years at CMU off campus. The 
apartments at London Terrace were deep into Oakland, 
and such independent living discouraged a collective 
community. I didnt like how far it was, she said, and I 
barely knew anybody.
So Mayekar moved to Morewood Gardens in her second 
semester and hasnt looked back. She likes the sense of 
community on campus, especially because it's so close to 
campus during the winter months. Although she may be 
unique in moving so quickly, Sonal is just one example of 
the problems that off-campus living can offer.
Lost in the shuffle
But while many students do like the on-campus housing 
options, getting a dorm room on campus can be difficult. 
The lottery system of Room Draw can be both complicated 
and frustrating. For students who want to live on campus, 
a bad Room Draw number can result in a 20-minute walk 
in the harsh Pittsburgh weather for the next year, or worse 
yet, a small room far away from friends and campus. 
There are countless stories of hapless first-years who 
found themselves where they least wanted to be because 
they didnt have the friends with good numbers who 
could pull them in.
At first, it all seemed very logical, easy, and organized, 
explained a first-year student about the Room Draw 
process. The student, who wishes to remain anonymous 
to avoid any future conflicts with Housing Services,
was trying to retain her current room while pulling in a 
friend. But her situation was complicated by the fact that 
her current room was reserved for the academic group 
of which she is a member. Confused about the situation, 
she contacted Housing Services, and while waiting for 
a reply, which we never got, we apparently missed some 
deadline. Now, not only do I have a random roommate, 
but also my friend who thought she would be living with 
me, missed her own Room Draw session. Now she has to 
look for off-campus housing.
This angry anonymous student is not alone. One transfer 
student, Justin Pye, did not have such a smooth transition 
into the Carnegie Mellon community. Pye, a sophomore 
physics major, recalled that only two days before he was 
to arrive for orientation day, he and his family called 
Housing Services to inquire why he had not yet received 
all of his housing materials. He found that he didnt 
have housing, even after he had submitted all the proper
paperwork. So two days before he was supposed to arrive 
on a new campus, Pye searched for housing somewhere 
off-campus. With help from friends back home, and a 
little bit of luck, he managed to get an apartment to live in 
for the first semester. Unfortunately for Pye, orientation 
was not nearly the experience it was intended to be: he 
was without a campus community.
Pye remained hopeful that he could live on campus in 
October, but again, Housing was not cooperative. The 
repeated response from Housing representativesWell, 
well try to find you something  along with the spans of 
waiting for days on end, made him angrily concede defeat 
and stay in the apartment off campus. (The Tartan was 
also asked to wait three weeks by Housing Services when 
it requested an interview to get their perspective.) There 
was no point in moving into campus after I had bought 
all that furniture and spent so much time in Oakland, 
he said dismally. He ended up waiting until the second

semester, when he was finally granted a campus home 
in Mudge. Pye reflects, If I had known it would be that 
difficult, I wouldnt have transferred.
Size versus comfort
But even dorm life goes downhill when the close-knit 
community on a single floor feels less like a family and 
more like a trap. One first-year noted that all the students 
on his floor were very close, but his floor was like a 
cocoon, and no one really hung out with anyone else on 
the dorm floor. Students complain that the dorm rooms 
are simply too small, especially those in New House and 
Morewood Gardens. True, these closet-sized rooms keep 
the students out of their dorms and in the lounges so that 
they can form healthy and helpful communities; but the 
small rooms are a poor trade-off for the existence of a 
lounge.
line forms here
Regardless of the designers intent, students such as junior 
Andrew Eure have complained that the dorms simply will 
not fit what they need. Eure admitted that within his 
major, drama design, were required to have workspaces 
of our own. Frustrated, he decided to move from Welch 
to Webster, and eventually off-campus entirely.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------11rayytnif q Tuday mggsf
In addition to not dealing with complicated forms, those 
who chose to live farther away sometimes look forward 
to their twenty minute long walk as a time to release all 
the tension of the school day. Once they get home, they 
can lounge in their living room, cook their own food in 
their own kitchen, and sleep in a separate bedroom. Mike 
Marorti, a junior decision science and human-computer 
interaction major, claimed that he could never live in a 
small dorm room again, after his experience living in a 
room in Veronica on Clyde Street. Nadia Noharuddin, a 
junior in mechanical engineering, happily relates to the 
distance of Webster from campus: If youre on campus 
you have to see campus on the weekends and after 
school.
But why deal with Housing Services and Room Draw 
just for the convenience of on-campus living? With no 
guarantee of a good dorm space, many upperclassmen 
figure that getting their own place is a better option. I 
dont understand why people dont move off-campus, 
says Jennifer Anttonen, a sophomore physics and creative 
writing major. You get your own room in a house with 
your own kitchen, dining room, washer and dryer, 
bathroom, and yard for less money than a room the size 
of my bathroom shared by two people.
In terms of cost, living off-campus is often cheaper for 
students on a budget. Plus, students have the complete
independence to set their own budget for food, which can 
also save them money. With on-campus housing costing 
more than five thousand dollars a year, most students 
can find cheaper housing off-campus. Even without the 
convenience of a Resident Assistant on hand, the benefits 
can outweigh the costs.
With a little bit of luck and a good Room Draw number, 
students can find convenient rooms that fit their personal 
needs. If worse comes to worst and you end up in a bad 
dorm situation, look on the bright side: At least you will 
have a great story to tell your friends! Be sure not to write
Katherine Hallberg/Art Staff
off dorms altogether because, just like a Schatz dinner, 
you never know what dorm situation is good for you until 
you try them all. Certainly, the sense of community from 
living in a dorm is well worth the risk of a bad roommate 
or a closet-sized room.

Big Als Metal Shop
Max Cavalera of Sepultura sits down with Big Al to discuss his music and inspiration
On the second full day of spring, under blue skies and 
surrounded by singing birds, I have come to realize that 
I love my job. For, you see, today is the day that I get to 
interview one of my heroes, Max Cavalera of Sepultura. 
A decade ago, after Brazil had won its first World Cup of 
our generation, an album by the name of Roots came out. 
With this disc, any teenage Brasileiro could finally begin 
to understand his parents.
Sepultura had a stellar discography before 96  Chaos 
A.D. has songs like Territory and Refuse/Resist 
that are metal anthems that live on today. But with Roots 
they smacked it out of the park by delving into their 
cultural lineage and recording with the Xavantes Indians 
from the Amazon.
Carlinhos Brown drummed alongside the mighty Igor 
Cavalera as Brazilian culture melted with the fury of the 
Metal scene to bring back Sepulturas primal essence. 
And by creating this visceral soundscape they, in effect, 
paved the way for others to combine their cultural roots 
with their musical vision.
Sadly, after Roots, the charismatic Max Cavalera

Cavalera's metal riffs are reflective of his Brazilian heritage.
(vocalist) left to follow his own vision, Soulfly. Releasing 
their self-titled debut in 98, Soulfly continued with the 
intermixing of Brazilian-tinged emotion and metallic 
anger. With Jackson Bandeira (Chico Science) on guitar, 
the songs came out raw with the emotion from Cavaleras 
departure from a successful band, on the heels of the 
murder of Maxs best friend and stepson, Dana Wells.
It is this emotion, and the tragedy of lost loved ones, that 
has carried Soulfly through three more albums: Primitive, 
3, and last years Prophecy. Tours around the globe have 
come and gone, and as a visual document of their seven 
years of existence, Max and Co. have released The Song 
Remains Insane, available now on DVD from Roadrunner 
Records.
With this history in mind, I sat down for a short chat with 
the throat heard round the world, Max Cavalera. With a 
new album already being recorded since December, and 
being mixed by Terry Date [of Pantera] this April, and on 
the heels of a jaunt across America with Morbid Angel, I 
asked him: Why release a DVD now?
Cavalera responded, Basically, after seven years of being 
a band, we finally feel like its time. When kids come to 
shows now, they scream Soulfly5 and not Sepultura 
anymore. Our first album has gone gold in the U.S., and 
this is a first for me.
With the last album, the emergence of Marc Rizzo (ex-111 
Nio) was a pleasant surprise, especially his playing style. 
Marc is definitely one of the most intense people, one 
of the most talented I have ever played with. In Soulfly, 
people expect me to keep changing the line-up. Maybe 
this time we should keep it the same, just for a change. 
[Cavalera laughs]. Live, hes amazing... and this album, 
with all the things that have gone on in my life lately, 
its just coming out ... darker. With the death of Dime 
[Dime Bag Darrell], and my step-grandson Moses the day 
after ... it just makes it harder. Moses did the whole U.S. 
tour with us. That scene with Moses on the DVD, I just 
look at it now.... I sometimes think hes gone to a better 
place ... that hes left this world thats going downhill.
With Sepultura, the question of whether there will be a 
reunion (begged for by fans) is usually a touchy one. In 
response to this question, Max said, I dont know. I could 
tell you yes, I could tell you no. Every day I wake up is the 
day I think about. I just dont know... with all the things 
that have gone on in the past in my life, I dont think I 
know anything for sure, that this is the way it has to be,
Despite all the heavy, sad things that have happened in 
Maxs life, he is still the consummate Brazilian, with a

loved ones.
warm laugh. When asked about whether he feels like a 
cultural ambassador to the U.S., he offers that [I would] 
love to carry the bandeira [flag], play the berimbau 
[musical instrument used in Capoeira] on stage. Still, I 
have a love/hate relationship with Brazil. There are a lot 
of things that I love about my country, and that I hate. 
Things that I went through there. But, you know, one of 
the things that I find funny is the thing about my accent.... 
You know the Napalm Death cover album that just came 
out? Well, they cover Troops of Doom (Sepultura), and 
Barney the Englishman is trying to do the Un! Dos! Tres! 
Quatro! Max laughs and continues, Same thing with 
Dave Grohl when I did the Probot thing with him  he 
says that heres Max with this accent, you know, this 
Brazilian accent that just fucks shit up!
What can I say  the man is a badass. Look for Soulfly 
here in Pittsburgh some time after the new album comes 
out. Until next week, thanks, CMU, and thanks, Max.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
Wilbur had two weeks to get into shape for the cruise.
He went to the local gym to procure a membership. T ' 
The attendant at the front desk was intimidating, fv 
to say the least. He towered over Wilbur not only in 1
stature, but in confidence as well. Welcome to Bills 
Gym! What can I help you with, puny man? Wilbur looked around 
nervously at all the hardbodies lifting weights and using assorted gym 
equipment. He felt as if he could breathe in all the calories that they 
were burning off. I would like to become a member of the gym, please. 
How much does it cost? The attendant, who had become intrigued 
with his own massive left bicep, turned his gaze back to Wilbur, 
looking him up and down. More than you can afford, puny man.

HOROSCOPES.
BY ASHLEIGH MOLZ
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You need a break. The combination of the 
stars alignment in your sign and the moon staying in your house will bring big 
trouble for your stress levels in early to mid-May. Mark my words.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): The reason youre feeling so lost lately is 
because you havent signed up to receive my on-the-phone readings daily. Yes, 
you may have to borrow some money to afford it, but it will be worth it. Just 
call 1-900-729-6333 (1-900-PAY-MEEE).
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): One of several situations is going to happen to 
you real soon, so be prepared: a) Someone from home (someone very close 
to you) is going to call and ask to visit you. Be careful how you respond, 
b) Youre going to be assigned a very important project and need io pick a 
partner. Whatever you do, dont pick the person you had last time who ruined 
everything! c) Youre going to be bored, and youll keep playing video games.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): You need to travel, and as soon as possible, or 
you might lose your mind. Go walk around New Zealand and see the sights, or 
somewhere like Mauritania or Yemen. Sound good?
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Oh dear. Something very private that youve been 
trying to keep under wraps will come to the surface. It may be embarrassing, 
but relax. The universe is vast and wonderful, so what's a little embarrassment 
about what you do in your free time with tangerine Speedos? Just flow with 
it, man.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Youve never been famous for your 
discretion, willpower, or frugality.... So... find something to be famous for, 
okay?
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Your roommate is going through a hard 
time right now. Dont try to comfort him; just stay out of your room for the 
next few weeks.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): That place that you always go to with 
the guy and the stuff? You know, your happy place? Well, next time you go, 
watch out for a dog with three legs and an eye patch. If you don't see one, 
consider yourself realiy lucky.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Its not that you dont have a 
sense of humor, its that your jokes are just not very funny, which is why youre 
the only one laughing sometimes. Its okay. Just either stop telling them, or 
sign up for a class. Please.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): I know your mom told you to 
imagine people in their underwear when you are intimidated, but I think 
imagining them working under you within the next few years will work better.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Stop hanging up the phone as soon as 
you hear it dialing her number. Ask her out; youve waited and deliberated long 
enough! What's the worst that could happen? Nothing is worse than calling 
and hanging up that often. Good luck.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): If youre looking for an adventure, play 
hooky. Maybe someone will make a great movie about it someday. Make sure 
to do really crazy things and almost get caught like five times; otherwise the 
movie will be boring.

Riding the Sin City bandwagon
Sin City is in theaters, and all the comic writers and cartoonists 
are buzzing about how much its creator, Frank Miller, has 
influenced them. A while ago I read a piece that Alan Moore 
wrote about him, in which he said that everything Miller 
does is about as gritty as comics can get. Hes a pretty hip 
dude; heres some information on him, since Im pretty sure 
most of you arent in the know.
Frank Miller is one of the infamous comic-book demagogues 
from the third great era of comics in the early 80s. At 
that time, he entered the business through Marvel after 
being invited to write a two-issue story for The Spectacular 
Spiderman. The excited response to his unique film-noir 
comic style earned him the position as a regular penciler on 
the comic Daredevil, where he created the seductive ninja 
assassin Elektra. I figured Daredevil must be Catholic, 
Miller mused at the time, because only a Catholic would be 
both an attorney and a vigilante.
Additionally, Miller began to publish creator-owned comics 
of his own, often in collaboration with his wife Lynn Varley, 
such as the idiosyncratic science-fiction samurai comic 
Ronin. He also wrote many stories that were drawn by artists 
at Dark Horse, such as Give Me Liberty, with Dave Gibbons, 
a story about a perverse future of racial injustice; and Hard 
Boiled, with Geoff Darrow, a loose adaptation of Philip 
K. Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (the same 
source material that inspired Ridley Scotts cult movie Blade 
Runner).
His success attracted DC to him, and they offered to let him 
make a solo run on Batman, with free reign to do whatever he 
wanted with the character. Millers comic, The Dark Knight 
Returns, literally redefined the whole character and created 
a cultural icon. Prior to Miller, Batman was the campy 
Adam West-style detective in blue tights, makin puns and 
being a fun, man-about-town playboy. In contrast, Millers 
The Dark Knight Returns is set in the near future in which a 
dark, aging Bruce Wayne comes out of retirement and dons 
the Batman suit again. Frank Millers Batman is a violent, 
mentally unhinged vigilante who murders the Joker and 
even takes down Superman in a delusional quest for justice 
and revenge. The comic was wildly successful, and singlehandedly transformed Batman into the gritty, black-asmidnight hero icon that inspired Tim Burtons 1989 movie 
and has survived until today. In interviews, Miller talks 
about how he received veritable crates of hate mail when 
the comic first hit newsstands accusing him of replacing a 
beloved character with an unfeeling monster, in addition to 
the mammoth pan-cultural praise.
From then on, Miller could basically publish whatever he
wanted, and so he published his self-written, self-drawn chef 
doeuvre, Sin City. The complete story is presented in seven 
threads that happen at around the same time in the same 
city, and occasionally overlap. Millers writing style for Sin 
City can be best described as a roller coaster ride. He builds 
up horrific momentum; each scene snowballs further and 
further out of the characters control until an inevitable 
crash in the end. I cant imagine reading any of the books in 
more than one sitting, because they just suck you in with the 
visuals right in the beginning and dont let go.
The first story, The Hard Goodbye, is told through the 
eyes of a mentally unbalanced thug named Marv who 
wakes up one morning in a room next to a dead well-todo woman and has no memory of the past few days. The 
second book, A Dame to Kill For, introduces a recovering 
alcoholic, a photographer/detective named Dwight whos 
being manipulated by an old flame named Ava. The Yellow 
Bastard is the next piece, an emotional, psychological drama 
about an ex-cop, Hartigan, whos mixed up in bad business 
involving a rich and powerful family. The Big Fat Kill is 
the opposite of that, the continuing story of Dwight in the 
style of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The fifth book, Family 
Values, was never a monthly comic, but published directly 
as a graphic novel, and fleshes out the character of Miho, 
an otherwise curious minor character in the background of 
the previous books. Booze, Broads, & Bullets is a collection 
of short stories from Sin City hed published over the years, 
and the final volume, Hell and Back, is a love story (rife 
with violence, of course) to finish off the series in a kind of 
perverse and ironic way.
As Im writing this I havent yet seen the movie, but I 
probably will by this Monday. Its just as well; I dont really 
feel qualified to say much about movies in general, since 
I dont have as much experience with them. Based on the 
trailers, I figure the film is going to be a mix of all the threads 
happening concurrently. It cant be that bad, though, because 
Miller was actively involved and satisfied with ever step of 
the production process.
All the big-box, Barnes & Noble-type bookstores stock all 
these books, especially in light of the flick, so theres really 
no excuse not to go read them. If you do, then seriously 
consider reading the whole shebang through rapidly, and 
then taking a second more careful read. I know that I became 
so enamored of the stark, black-and-white noir visuals at first 
that I missed a lot of the subtleties that Frank Miller wrote 
into the characters.

1968-2005
Composite by Danielle Saudino
Mitch Hedberg, who performed at CMU for Carnival last year, died last Wednesday 
of heart failure. Hedberg was a comedian famous for his quirky humor who 
appeared on That 70s Show, The Late Show with David Letterman, and Crank 
Yankers. In parting, here are some of Hedbergs most memorable lines:
"Alcoholism is a disease, but it's the only one you can get yelled at for having 
I don't have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman whod be mad at me for saying that. 
I got my hair highlighted, because I felt some strands were more important than others 
"This shirt is dry-clean only. Which means it's dirty.
