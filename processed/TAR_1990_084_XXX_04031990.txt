Feds raid 
Student 
Despairs 
Office
By HELL N. A. HANDBASKET
Natrat Detracting Editor
Federal agents stormed the Student Despairs 
Office Friday and busted a drug-smuggling ring 
headed by Dean of Student Despairs Spike 
Muffy.
Carnage Mellon Alcohol Patrol Chief Jim LaBaglady confirmed that crates of cocaine with a 
street value of $18 billion were seized from the 
second floor of Wiener Hall after authorities 
received a tip from an informant that the drugs 
were to be shipped out over the weekend.
At 3 pm FBI agents sealed off the building and 
sent a SWAT team into Student Despairs with 
orders to detain all personnel and search all 
offices. According to LaBaglady, the operation 
was proceeding as planned until one agent was 
distracted long enough to allow Associate Dean 
Louise The Nose Jocks to pull an AK-47 from 
her desk and fire desperately into the crowd.
After a few tense minutes of gunplay, Jocks 
was finally felled by a sniper stationed in the 
Substantial Pain office. Also killed were Assis
tant Dean Juan Have-a-banana, two students 
of little or no consequence, and vacationing 
Registrar Slick Hamburger. Being dead, Ham
burger could not be reached for comment.
According to authorities, an investigation into 
the smuggling ring has been on-going for three 
months. That investigation revealed a continu
ous flow of drugs from Iraq, through Carnage 
Mellon, to Chatter College, where students are 
preparing to throw what one federal agent called 
a really big party.

Officials protest 
unauthorized 
use of Natrat
By STU PID
Natrat Detracting Editor
Carnage Mellon officials have filed suit to stop two Univer
sity of Spittsburg seniors from selling Nearly Nifty Natrat 
disk virus protectors at Carnage Mellon. The protectors come 
with a picture of Carnage Mellons mascot, a plaid Natrat.
We own the Natrat, its firstborn, and anything remotely 
resemblinga Natrat, said Carnage Mellon spokesman Cmon 
Hailacab. The University contends that it is entitled to 94 
percent of the proceeds from the protector sales.
However, Spit students Dimwit Pearls and Auntie Em 
Parking disagree. They contend that the Natrat is a noble 
creature found in the wild and cannot be owned, bought, or 
sold. The two philosophy majors plan to fight the Universitys 
suit.
We are simply taking a picture of an animal, however 
strange looking, and putting it onto a disk protector package. 
Carnage Mellon is just looking for another way to suck money 
from students, no matter what school they actually attend, 
said Parking.
Hailacab disagrees. The Natrat was invented in one of our 
biochemistry laboratories. You only see them in the wild

Covert allocation exhausts

A Natrat investigation has uncovered 
the covert allocation of funds that forced 
Stupid Senate to dissolve two percent of 
the student body last fall.
Stupid Senate Chair Miss Naybor 
confirmed Friday that Senates Ruling 
Family approved the purchase of nearby
Chatter College. The purchase price was 
$30,000. Naybor expalined that the price 
was unusually high because Stupid 
Senate was able to con vice Chatter Presi

with the farm for an extra $10,000.
The Natrat uncovered the purchase by

Carnage Mellon President Dicky 
Cyborg announced today that Carnage 
Mellon would sell the hyphen that used 
to be in its name to Czechoslovakia for an 
undisclosed sum.
The Slovak population of Czechoslova
kia has been demanding that their coun
try change its name from Czechoslova
kia to the Czecho-Slovak Republic. In 
this way, the Slovaks claim they will be 
distinguished from the Czechs.
Cyborg said, This is a great way to 
help the people of the Czech-Slovak 
Republic in their struggle for freedom 
courtesy Alcohol Patrol and democracy.
Vaclev Havel, Czechoslovakias new 
president, commented that this is a great 
example of the free market in action.... 
This could never have happened in the
days of the Communists, who would have 
forced us to produce our own hyphens. 
Carnage Mellon Dean of Student De
spair Spike Muffy said, Well, right now 
the hyphen is just going to waste sitting 
in my office. Of course, Ill have to find a 
new place for my coat, but I wont let that 
stand in the way of freedom in Europe. 
And remember, fahrvergniigenV 
Carnage Mellon Proctologist Anal Jordache said, This is another great step 
for Carnage Mellon. An SEI in Japan, a

Carnage Mellon researchers developing Magic-Lev
In any event, Magic-Lev seems really neat 
 Ranger Gorgon, 
Engineering and Personal Policy chair
By ROSS PARK MALL
Natrat Rumor Gatherer
Carnage Mellon is developing a high
speed train to the Pittsburgh airport 
which would use anti-gravity gyroscopes 
and would be fueled by cold nuclear fu
sion, according to Glen Garry of the 
Transportation Research Center. The 
project is currently dubbed the MagicLev Train.
A working prototype is still a number 
of years off, according to Garry. But we 
do have a lot of great-looking artist ren
ditions and some color animation too. 
Were looking at making a video tape
with Meryl Streep narrating.
Garry said that the fusion and anti
gravity technologies are still being ex
plored at universities in both Utah and 
Japan.
He said that because the technology 
seems to work only in academic settings, 
we may have to set up a university 
department on each train.
But Garry stressed that the train proj
ect is pure research. He said Our re
search shouldnt be tainted by real-world 
considerations. This is a university  
we deal with theories here. Besides, we 
wouldnt get as much money over the 
years if we had to actually apply our 
results to anything.
Richard Barron, associate director of
GSIAs Marketing Research Center, has 
assembled for Magic-Lev an inter-disci
plinary design team consisting of GSIA 
professors, design professors, a CE 
graduate student, and an H&BEST 
GUESS undecided student thrown in for 
good measure.
Barron said that preliminary market 
analysis indicates that the train would 
be most successful if it had a stopover at 
the coming downtown Macys depart
ment store and were shaped like a Dustbuster.
Ranger Gorgon of the Department of 
Engineering and Personal Policy, hailed 
the Magic-Lev project as environmen
tally .responsible and having a distinct 
advantage over the magnetic levitation! 
trains under consideration. Everyone 
knows that frequent consistent expo
sure to electro-magnetic fields perhaps 
has a correlating probability of a large 
degree of minimal perceptive risk of cell 
mutation that people may or may not, 
according to their mental models, have 
to worry about, he gasped. In any event, 
Magic-Lev seems really neat.
The Transportation Research Center 
is funded by the Natrat Science Founda
tion. Garry said the train endeavor would 
assisted by the Utah Fusion Cooperative 
and Japans newNippon-Mellon College.
Muffy mandates mellow medley for mentally maimed
By FAIRY EASY
Natrat Floozy Stud
Amid concerns that Carnage 
Mellon has become too stressful 
an environment for students, 
Dean of Student Despairs Spike 
Muffy submitted a proposal last 
week designed to relax the at
mosphere of Carnage Mellon.
The proposal calls on admistration and faculty to integrate The 
Grateful Dead into all facets of 
student life. According to Muffy, 
a hard-core Dead Head, Weve 
got to transform this hell-pit 
bastion of stress into something
more mellow ... dude.
Associate Dean of Student 
Despair Louise Jocks, who shared 
Muffys love for the group, agreed. 
Yeah ... dude, she said days 
before she was gunned down by 
federal agents in the Student 
Despairs Office.
According to the proposal, Car
nage Mellons Tartan design will 
be changed to tie-dye, a waymellow symbol, said Muffy.
Other proposed changes include 
the replacement of Carnage Mel
lon shuttle buses and vans with 
pre-1980 Volkswagens and the 
sale of mushroom burgers and
shakes which will be introduced 
in the Barf an Swills upcoming 
shroomin in the 90s advertis
ing campaign.

he felt it was the security officers 
job. The officer bludgeoned Smel
lyfoot about the head and neck 
area and asked again why Smel
lyfoot was there. Because Im a

Dance policy changed
ABC Dance has announced a 
new dance scheduling policy.
Were going to put more money 
and effort into advertising, but 
then never actually have a dance, 
said ABC Chair Blob Hefty.
We wouldnt have to spend any 
money on the dance, he ex
plained. And with the money well
save, we can concentrate on ad
vertising and rack up mondo PR 
points.
Hefty admits there are a few 
drawbacks. Someday someone 
might show up at one of the adver
tised dances, only to find an empty 
room. But were not too worried 
about that.

Dicky Cyborg leaned back in his 
office chair and slowly lit his cigar 
before suddenly convulsing forwards 
and nearly retching on the oriental 
rug decorating the floor of his presi
dential office.
I dont even smoke, he exclaimed. 
I cant believe the things I do just to 
let you folks write fluff leads!
Ive never liked money, he con
tinued. When I was a child, my 
mother made me take an allowance. 
All through my life, people have tried 
to force cash on me. But Im presi
dent now and no one is going to make 
me accept money. Maggot likes 
money and so does my dog, but I hate 
the stuff and I wont get near it. 
.Furthermore, I am orderingit banned 
from my private plane, SEI One 
Maggot Cyborg confirmed her 
husbands statements. Ive never 
been able to get him to accept money 
for anything, she said. He refuses 
to cash his Carnage Mellon paycheck. 
When we got rid of our old car, he 
wanted to give it away. Ive been 
trying for years to get him to deal 
with money but if his own mother 
cant do it, I give up.
In response to Cyborgs statement, 
Fellon Bank sent ten tons of money 
to the Weiner Hall parking lot. 
Cyborg refused to touch it but Vice 
Presidunce for Illicit Affairs Dred 
Rogers ordered Quizzical Plant to 
deliver it to a shelter for homeless 
aeople and then burn it in front of 
them.
We didnt want to waste the money

good laugh out of it, said Cmon

Actually, it was a very clever operation, 
said LaBaglady. The Iraqi dealers would go 
downstairs to the ID center and get their pic
tures taken. The ID center keeps no records, so 
they knew identities would remain secret."
After obtaining fake student IDs, dealers 
would deliver the contraband to Muffys office, 
and then receive payment in the form of emer
gency student loans from Student Despairs.
Its very difficultto launder that much money 
$200 at a time, LaBaglady speculated, so 
they were bound to slip up sometime.
Muffy was not in his office at the time, and 
authorities fear he may have fled to Iraq in 
order to escape prosecution, or Chatter in order 
to forget his troubles. A warrant has been 
issued for his arrest, and anyone with knowl

people, we are a top ten university and will do whatever

Pearls and Parking started selling their virus protec
tors at Carnage Mellon one month ago after a similar 
product, Prime Panther Protectors failed at Spit. There 
just isnt the sense of urgency, or even understanding, of 
safe computing on our campus. Students at Carnage 
Mellon have a much more relaxed attitude about their 
computers than Spit students, said Pearls.
The protectors, which sell for a dollar apiece, have been 
bought by some students as practical devices in the fight 
against software transmitted diseases (STDs) and by 
others as novelty items. Pearls and Parking dont care 
about a buyers reasoning; they simply care about the 
two cents profit they make on each protector. The two 
have netted over two dollars in profits since starting 
sales of the protectors.
My friends at Spawn Late had all sorts of neat Spawn 
Late stuff and Carnage Mellon never had anything, so 
Im glad that they [Pearls and Parking] are selling their 
protectors. I bought a couple, not because I needed any, 
but because they make great gifts, said junior Fat 
Cuban.
In the meantime, Pearls and Parking will continue to 
sell their protectors off-campus from the back of a 78 
Plymouth parked on Devon Road until the suit is settled.
When asked if CMU would be setting up scholarships 
or exchange programs to help Eastern European stu
dents study here, Cyborg said, Ha Ha Ha, what are you 
 stupid? If they want to study here so badly, theyre 
better be willing to pay for it. And pay a lot.

Good editorial, huh guys?
From The Natrat Writers 
Guide: A Lesson in Editorial 
Writing 
You probably dont have any 
opinion at all about this editorial 
youve been assigned, butyou need 
to fill this space. Thats why you 
fabricate positions on campus 
events and issues in the dead of the 
night, right before publication. 
Dont worry about embarrassment 
over this horrid scrap oftextyoure 
creating  we wont make you 
sign it. Just go ahead and start 
right off:
All right, you boneheads, pay 
attention. Theres been a problem 
on campus recently, and its really 
been bugging us.
You gotta love the standard 
editorial opening. Note that it has 
nothing to do with the subject at 
hand but manages to make you, 
the writer, sound incredibly 
superior toyour lowly readers. Oh, 
and dont forget to write in the 
plural voice  someone once told 
us it makes us sound like royalty.
It seems that all our favorite 
Stupid Senate funded 
organizations arent giving us the 
value we deserve. Theyre all 
cutting back on such Activities 
Fee perks as free phone calls home 
and complimentary Xerox copies 
for class.
Whats worse, the Activities 
Board is ruining its image by
eliminating all those expensive 
glossy posters weve all come to 
love, and The Thom is projecting 
itll be in the black by 1995.
Whats going on?
Make a big punch by using a 
short paragraph  typically a 
single question  right before you 
make your main point. Nobody 
knows how it affects the readers, 
but heck, the judges in those 
journalism contests sure love it.
Financial responsibility is 
striking the campus and we, for 
one, wont stand for it. As of this 
writing, Stupid Senate still has a 
hundred bucks in the account, and 
 get this  its gotta be used up 
by June 30!
Clearly, its up to us to make 
sure we squeeze the maximum 
value from our Activities Fee, and 
the only way we can do that is to 
spread the wealth. The basic 
environmentally-sound truth is 
that money was made to be spent.
Its a lesson we all should take to 
heart  and take to the bank.
End your editorial with a sticky - 
sweet play on words. It wont help 
you make your point, but itll sure 
make you feel cleuer to know that 
youre master enough of the 
English language to really 
command it. If youre lucky, itll 
impress the Enema-in-Grief so 
much that hell let you write 
another editorial next week!
Keep yourself stink-free, please!
Remember when you were grow
ing up? If you dont then the whole 
premise for this editorial will be 
shot. You see, we are dependent 
on your willingness to follow us on 
our little flights of fancy at the 
beginning of editorials. If you 
dont, then there will be no com
mon frame of reference amongst 
ourselves with which we (the edi
torial board) can try to use and 
thus manipulate you into buying 
our side of an issue. We can thus 
con you into believing that you are 
one of us. Look, theres no way in 
hell you are going to get what you 
want in all of this sojust shut your 
mouth and keep reading. Remem
ber, we dont need your activities 
fee money all that much anyway.
So, lets try again. Remember 
when you were growing up? Good. 
You and your parents always 
fought because they wanted you 
to bathe and you didnt. Regard
less of who won, many of you are
in the same situation now. Only 
now youre fighting with your 
roommate and the other people on 
campus about your not bathing.
There is no reason for young 
adults to go around stinking of 
sweat, pizza, and natural body 
odors. Women are just as guilty as 
the men in this matter. In fact, 
there is no racial, gender, reli
gious, or even cultural distinction 
here; civilized people bathe, and 
bathe regularly.
And for those who simply douse 
themselves in cologne on a daily 
basis thinking their stench will 
not affect the general campus, we 
say nice try but it doesnt work.
We know that with classes and 
projects and the like, not every
one can bathe everyday. Fine, but 
that does not excuse those who 
can from their responsibility.
We are sick and tired of taking 
the phrase, This campus stinks, 
literally.

Sex is clean, but disposal isnt
Editor:
Here we are, near 
the end of yet another 
reproducitve year at 
Carnage Mellon, and I 
find that there is a
Moan'n'
Groan
problem which requires the immediate 
attention of the entire campus commu
nity (and you know who you are).
I am a secretary whose office is lo
cated on the second floor of Porker Hell. 
Being a gentle-born Englishwoman who 
is proud of her heritage, I must say that 
I am utterly disgraced at the sight of 
used rubbers overflowing in the trash
cans at every entrance in Porker Hell, 
not to mention Faker Hell as well.
This is not to say that I dont encourage 
safe sex. I am, in fact, the head secretary 
in the sexonomics department, and I am 
obligated to inform the campus commu
nity of ways in which they can either 
maximize their protection or minimize 
their sexual intake. For both our present 
and future generations, precautions are 
an absolute necessity, and I have tried to 
fulfill my departmental duties to the 
best of my ability.
However, I do feel that both the parties 
who used the condoms and the Quizzical
Plant could do a better job at keeping th 
areas a little more sanitary. There is n 
reason why I should have to walk throug] 
other peoples bodily filth on my way t 
work.
I highly encourage the guilty partie 
to do something about the disposal 
their toys before I am enticed to take th 
problems to higher authorities.

The women of Car

getting p.o.ed about all 
the guys on this cam
pus complaining about 
the male-female ratio. Look, creeps, WE 
CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!!! If 
youre that desperate, go find a Spit girl 
or a Chatter girlthey enjoy their long 
walk of shame.
According to certain males on this
campus, all CMU women are bitches 
with ice water running through their 
veins. We beg to differ. We wont jump 
your bones five minutes after we meet 
you, and our mating call is not Im soooo 
drunk!! But we are just as interested in 
sex as the next girl. After several hours 
in front of the computer arguing with 
Andrew, theres nothing better than.... 
But we digress. The real point here is 
that while there may not be as many 
females as males on this campus, willing
females do exist. Whats more, most of 
us dont have any communicable or vene 
real diseases.
Heres our last comment: TRY IT. YOli 
MIGHT LIKE IT. And the longest wait 
shell have to make is across campus.

I feel it is my duty to

did not say good. Rather, I said food. 
I was faking my death to inform the 
student body of the dangerous toxins 
that are placed in the food we are pro
vided with by Marrynot Corporation.
If this ignorant so-called reporter had 
maybe been paying attention to what he 
was being told, I would not have to 
embarrass him by pointing out his care
less errors to his readership. And it 
doesnt matter if I am a wimp  I am
entitled to the same respect as others.

What exactly goes on 
between 5:15 and 6:30 
pm in the Morewood 
Rec Room? The shades 
are always down. Of 
course we all know whats going on. What 
else involves music, and people dressed 
in lycra scanties?
The real question is what are these 
people hiding? It seems that most women 
who participate in this wholesome 
physical activity enjoy wearing the 
stretchy garments so characteristic of 
the sport.
Why then do these same people seem 
so adamant about keeping the shades
pulled down on the rest of us? Why not 
let us see the light? Or moonlight, what
ever the case?
I would say unto the noble partakers 
of aerobics, generate some publicity! Let 
the rest of us see what youve got to offer. 
Or maybe youve got too much to offer 
maybe youre in training for some grand 
unveiling in the near future? Spring 
Carnival, perhaps?
Well whatever the underlying scheme 
may be, I suggest you give the rest of us 
a hint as to what is going on. After all, it 
is our rec room that youre using.

Help! Pro-We 
makes no sense!
Those people have used and 
manipulated the media for too 
long. The time has come for cooler 
heads to prevail. These pinkoliberals have been jerking us 
around for too long. We have been 
suckered in like lambs going to 
slaughter. How much longer are 
we going to let ourselves be con
trolled. The time has come for 
action. These neo-thinkers have 
to be stopped.
The American Dream is being 
tarnishedhell, its being down
right polluted. Its time to set the 
record straight and let the facts 
talk for themselves. Any redblooded, patriotic, flag-waving, 
bible toting American knows that 
what is right is right.
The moral fiber in this country 
is going down the toilet. Children 
are being left abandoned in their 
own homes by parents either to 
drugged out or too politically 
active to care for their own chil
dren. No wonder that the satanic, 
blood drinking rock and roll hoo
ligans are able to weave their 
magic spell upon the youth of 
America.
But dont for a moment think 
that the children are innocent 
victims. They know the difference 
between right and wrong but are
too drugged up and just plain 
stupid to follow the righteous 
path.
People must begin to learn their 
places in society as they did years 
ago. Different people were cre
ated for different purposes. What 
right do we have trying to inte
grate with one another. Doing so 
goes against the great plan civili
zation (as embodied by this great 
country) was founded upon. 
People must stick to the path set 
for them. Diverging from that path 
is to lead this country and thus, 
civilization, down to the pit. Know 
yourself, as the good book says, is 
all that anyone needs to know.
We can no longer allow our
selves and our children to be in

poured down the drain along with 
our very own existence. They are

The hardest part of being a 
Natrat columnist is deciding 
whom to pick on each week.
President Cyborg and Weiner 
Hall get boring, and you quickly 
run out of fraternities, athletic 
teams, neighboring colleges, and 
student organizations to crack 
mean and tasteless jokes about.
But thats what can make the 
job so rewarding. When you can 
find that one person or group that 
has done nothing to bother any
one and completely ridicule it far 
beyond it deserves, you know
Expired Minds
Stewing Leftknee
youve accomplished something.
It is a special skill, but one that 
may be taught and refined with 
practice. And this week, because
I could not think of anyone to pick 
on, I will teach you how to write 
an Expired Minds column.
First, come up with a cute in
tro. Dont worry that you havent
selected a target or even thought 
about how to fit the intro into the 
column. Thats your editors job. If 
the sentence sounds like some
thing Andy Rooney would'have 
said, youre getting warm.
Second, decide who you want to 
blast. Creativity means every
thing. Anyone can make cracks 
about Stupid Senate or record 
labelling or flag burning like the 
other, less-talented Natrat colum
nists, but to make jokes about 
another college takes real talent.
Try to pick an obscure campus
group that is having public rela
tions problems and could be dev
astated by your well-aimed prose. 
Failing that, you can always fall 
back on random blasts at the 
University like those other lesstalented columnists.
Third, marshall your jokes. 
They probably wont be fanny at 
first. Read them aloud ten or 
twenty times until you laugh at 
them. Dont let your editor touch 
the jokes  he/she does not have 
a good sense of humor. He/she is 
too worried about things like libel
and costly court appearances.
Fourth, smirk a lot. Smirking 
in print is difficult, some of them 
call it sarcasm, but thats just 
because they dont get the jokes.
Fifth, watch the cards and let
ters pour in. Natrat columnists 
are some of Carnage Mellons most 
admired people. Your fans will 
call you at all hours of the day, 
and write to tell you just what 
they think of you. Dont worry  
the little people have never un
derstood fine art.
Dont worry about nagging
moans'ngroans or a libel claim. 
Remember  you are a journal
ist, and you present the news to 
the best of your ability. It doesnt 
matter if your research was done, 
in the gutter outside of PHI, as 
long as you can document it.
Above all, keep writing. People 
will read your column, no matter 
how bad it is.
Stewing Leftknee is a secondyear masters student in some 
obscure school here, who doesnt 
know how to write splat.
The place: The Natrat office.
The time: Monday morning, 5:02 am.
The question: "Can I ask a seemingly stupid 
question  have we Varityped anything yet?"
The answer: "No.1

SPROUTSPEAK
by Dr. Spliced Rubber
You got to know 
your limitations
I tried. I tried very hard. I 
tried to keep my place and only 
comment on those issues and 
events deemed banal or insig
nificant enough to warrant a 
sports column in a college 
newspaper. But the events of 
last Saturday night can no 
I longer be ignored, not even by 
me.
I will therefore seek to find 
worthy and enlightened com
mentary on the tragedy which 
has rocked this campus. 
I know I have no place, no 
right. I know that by doing this, 
I may seriously upset the 
balance of nature. I know that 
the great journalism god in the 
sky may strike me dead for 
trying to be a writer and not 
merely a typist with a big 
vocabulary, and send me to hell 
where my flesh will be forever 
ripped from my body by gro
tesque serpents.
I therefore walk upon the wa
ters of knowledge and dignity, 
knowing full well I am not pre
pared to do so and may sink like 
a bloated sponge. May God be 
with me.
It started simply enough. A 
group of conscientious college 
students came up with yet an
other brilliant idea to raise 
money for a charity and thus 
maintain their guise of being 
anything but a horde of 
drunken, undersexed yahoos. 
The plan: Relive the wonder
ful days of yesteryear when the 
college experience was a rich, 
vibrant time in ones life. They 
planned on stuffing as many of 
their number as they could into 
a phone booth. But, since tradi
tional, silver phone booths are 
all but extinct, they looked for a 
Volkswagen. Again, no such 
luck. They decided to try 
something distinctly Pittsburgh 
in nature so they tried a Yugo. 
Again, they were frustrated in 
their attempts because the only 
one they could find was in the 
process of being transformed 
into the first two-door buggy for 
competition this year (Experts 
predict it will roll well but may 
have some trouble in the chute).
Out of desperation, the group 
decided to stuff as many people 
as they could into Entropy. It 
was a smart idea and one which 
would be endearing to the 
entire campus. After all, almost 
everyone has crammed into the 
place at one time or another 
trying to grab a Twinkie or 
bottle of Evian before class or 
the Shuttle. 
The tragedy struck with 
almost 150 sweaty, semi
conscious people in the store.
The walls succumbed to the 
pressure. And in an instant it 
was over.
Where were the stress beams? 
Where were the backup sup
ports? Didnt any one think?
These poor, wretched souls 
met their end in the name of 
fun and sport. But oh, how 
tragic the consequences when 
one tries to play with nature. 
Entropy was named accordingly 
for a reason. Energy, especially 
free energy, is a dangerous 
thing. Why did they attempt to 
challenge it? 
All I can say is that with
 every fiber of my being, I will 
see to it that there is an investi
gation. This story will not end 
here, I... I cant go on right 
now....

Scandal rocks IM department
Backgammon players try to increase advantage with steroids
By STONE PICKAXE
Natrat Has-Been Wanna-Be Type
In the tense, competitive world of 
Intramural Backgammon, some will 
stop at nothing. There have been scan
dals before  hired ringers, blatant 
cheating, even point shaving in Water 
Basketball  but this weeks relevations come to the fore in the history of 
IM scandals.
It was revealed the several players
on the Robotics Club Backgammon ----------------
Bastards team used anabolic steroids 
to improve their performance. We were shocked. 
They should be ashamed.
When questioned as to how in the world steroids 
would help in Backgammon, members of the team 
responded that in Backgammon, every little bit 
helps. Geeks.
When asked what effect anabolic steroids would 
have on Backgammon, the members of the team 
launched into a discussion of the importance of 
physical exertion in Backgammon. Its a game that 
is understood by very few, because of its infinite 
complexity. In a way its like chess  minutes to 
learn, a lifetime to master...
Shut up, you stupid geek, replied the team 
captain, I.M. Huge, yer stoned again. Stupid druggy. 
Steroids were more of a mental boost, he continued, 
something to give you an anchor amidst the incred
ible stress. People dont realize the stress that game 
can produce  weve lost people in the middle of 
matches from the stress. Its amazing stress like 
Ive never seen it. Shut up, you geeks! came a call 
from the hall.
The IM department was rocked by the scandal.

backbone of the IM program, was put under immeIt's a game that is understood by

diate NCAA suspension and investigation, though 
itis yet to be determined what authority th e NCAA 
has over Carnage Mellon intramurals.
The program was also put under in-school inves
tigation, ordered by none other than Dick Cyborg. 
According to the Big Dick, the importance of 
Backgammon to the mental health of the school 
cannot be underestimated. Itis something of which 
the students can be proud, something to which 
they can point and say, that, that is CMU at its 
finest.
God, were in trouble.
For the time being, the Backgammon program 
has been placed on probation, and mandatory drug 
test have been instigated. The testing program 
will be the strictest in the nation, according to John 
Hardup, Athletics Destructor.Well test em any
time, anywhere, for anything. In the middle of 
class, at 4:30 in the morningwe dont care!!! Ha, 
Ha, Ha, Ha!!!!.
For now, all games have been suspended, pend
ing further investigation and testing. The future of 
CMU backgammon is unsure as of now, and only 
time will tell.
Does anybody care?

Maggot Cyborg traded 
to Pirates for mop to 
be named later
By JOHANN RIVERDAMM
Natrat Detracting Editor
In perhaps the most shocking 
condition of the baseball lockout 
settlement, Pittsburgh Pirates 
Chief Executing Office Boy Studless Damnfifth has announced 
that Carnage Mellon First Lady 
Maggot Cyborg will be required 
to run errands and clean the locker 
room for the Shmucks.
Damnfifth, who is also Chairclam of CMUs Board of Direc
tionless, said that he was sorry to 
have to go to such extremes to 
settle the labor dispute but 
thought that in the end it was 
worth it. Its honest work, he 
said. I wouldnt have asked her 
to do anything illegal but there is 
nothing wrong with being a clean
ing lady or a gofer.
Dicky Cyborg said he was not 
upset by the deal. He said Ill 
miss her around the house but 
Maggot and I are both glad to be 
able to contribute to the great 
game of football. I dont think this 
will hurt my ability to act as presidunce of Carnage Mellon. Im 
dust in three months anyway. Ive 
already had my last Presidunces 
Ball so she doesnt have to make 
anymore public appearances. 
Maybe Ill even go to a Penguins 
match to see her.
I am looking forward to the 
challenge of the job, said Maggot 
Cyborg. After 17 years in the 
background it will be nice to have 
a professional position of my own. 
And off the record [oops], those 
players are really cute. I may just 
dump Dicky and go shack up with 
Willie Stargell.
Tetris is newest IM sport
By DATEME CUSTARDPIE
Natrat Sportin Type
In an effort to mold the Intra
mural Department more to the 
image of Carnage Mellon, the IM 
board has decided to install the 
computer game Tetris as a new 
activity.
There were just too many nor
mal people involved in the IM
program playing normal sports. 
It isnt representative of CMU, 
said Intramural Destructor Earl 
J. Bogey. He hopes Tetris will 
entice the real CMU students to 
get involved in Intramurals.
Going out on a limb, the IM 
Board decided to purchase Macin
tosh computers that can handle 
Color Tetris, as an added incen
tive to prospective players.
Bobby Knight: Im tired of winning!
Indiana legend applies for CMU coaching position
By DATEME CUSTAKDPIE
Natrat Sportin Type
Indiana, where basketball is 
practically a religion, is shocked 
to hear of its beloved Bobby 
Knights departure from his glory 
years at Indiana University. He 
is headed for the head coach posi
tion at Carnage Mellon Univer
sity.
The general reaction around the 
state is, Carnage what? Hoosiers are stunned, coniused, and
saddened by Knights betrayal of 
Indiana basketball and his mys
terious desire to coach a Division
III team, the Carnage Mellon 
Natrats.
Nevertheless, CMU Athletic 
Destructor John Hardup is ecstactic at the thought of hiring 
the man who coached the 1987 
NCAA champion Indiana Hoosiers. Hellbeagreatassettoour 
program. We decided to change 
our attitude  its about time we 
brought in fresh, new people who
have enthusiasm for what this 
basketball program is all about 
 losing. If Bobby Knight wants 
to lose, hes come to the right 
place.
However, if CMU wants to lose, 
it cannot be a half-hearted effort, 
said Hardup. He has already 
spoken to Knight about imple
menting disciplinary action 
against the players who were 
responsible for CMUs four wins 
this season. If we want to keep 
Mr. Knight around, we have to
make sure that no good basket
ball occurs that might result in a 
win, said Hardup.
Knight appears to have made a 
complete turnaround in his char
acter as a result of his decision. 
When reporters bombarded his 
home in Bloomington, Indiana, 
he graciously invited them in and 
answered all questions politely, 
not swearing once.
Knight calmly explained, Im 
tired of winning. It just gets old 
after a while. Im thrilled to go to
Carnage Mellon and experience 
the winless seasons and empty 
stands.
So while the Hoosier state sits 
in stunned silence, CMU rejoices 
in snagging Knight. However, one 
thing worries the athletic depart
ment hereit will have to invest 
in plenty of chairs for Knight to 
throw.
As for a new Indiana coach, 
officials at the university will only 
reveal that Dick Cyborg is being 
considered.

7f you can get another beer, you need another beer'
skipped out of the zoo and went to 
a Penguins game. God, how I love 
that team! Anyway, we got a beer 
and it came in a 32 ounce cup.
Natrat: Which is a PUB.
Tilt: Exactly. Because it has 
penguins on the outside.
Natrat: How did Wyle E. get 
kicked out of the zoo?
Tilt: He broke several of the 
rules. One morning we were 
drinking over at the African ex
hibit when he got this really cool 
idea. We each stole a stroller 
you know, one of those things 
that humans put their kids in.
Natrat: Im familiar with them.
Tilt: So we stole two of them 
from the front gate and we raced 
down the hill. Wyle E. ran into a 
zoo official and they both crashed 
into a concession stand. While
they were both laying there amid 
the snowcones God how I love 
snowcones! Anyway, they were 
laying there and Wyle E. got sick 
on him. The next day he went in 
front of the Judicial Board and 
those monkeys decided to throw 
him out of the zoo. He was gone.
Natrat: Do you know where he 
is?
Tilt: Last I heard he was back 
in the desert trying to catch a 
bird.
Natrat: Have you lost any of 
your other drinking buddies?
Tilt: Yeah, unfortunately, one 
of our members died due to alco
hol.
Natrat: Im sorry.
Tilt: So was he.
Natrat: What happened?
Frank: We were drinking one 
night, when Mike...
Natrat: What was Mike?
Frank: A pig, we used to call 
him, the Photopig.
Natrat: Why photopig?
Frank: He loved to take pic
tures and he never showed any
one the pictures that he had taken.
Natrat: How exactly did he die?
Frank: He was drunk one night 
and a couple of the guys were 
stroller racing again. One of them 
crashed into Photopig, breaking 
his leg. Photopig walked around 
for a few days before gangrene set 
in and killed him-.
Natrat: Has his death affected 
your drinking habits at all?
Frank: Definitely. Right after 
he died and we ate him...
Natrat: You ate him?
Frank: Yeah, he was a pig. You 
know: bacon, ham, pork chops, all 
the good non-kosher foods.
Natrat: OK.
Frank: So we ate him and we

zoo for reckless stroller racing.
all got trichinosis. That stopped 
our drinking for about two weeks. 
Then we had a huge-ass get well 
party and everyone got drunk.
Alfred: What is going on here?
Natrat: Im conducting several 
interviews with some party ani
mals. Who are you?
Alfred: Im Alfred Pomperington the third, the City Zoo Head of 
Security.
Natrat: Do these party animals 
ever give you problems with their 
drinking antics?
Alfred: Many times. Ive had 
six or seven in my office because 
of the troubles. One of them, the 
coyote I believe, was kicked out of 
the zoo, a pig received a fatal 
injury at one of their parties. Of 
course, then there are the lem
mings.
Natrat: What about the lem
mings?
Alfred: Well, have you ever seen 
a drunk lemming?
Natrat: No.
Alfred: They get drunk and 
then they get real suicidal. At one 
of their first parties, twenty lem
mings killed themselves after one 
drink. It wasnt pretty they 
threw themselves at the zoo lawnmowers.
Natrat: Have you had any more 
problems with the lemmings?
Alfred: Yes, two more deaths 
have occurred. Last week two 
more lemmings were killed. They 
got drunk and jumped in Bluntos 
nutbowl.
Blirnto: Yeah, and I ate them 
before I knew what I was doing. It 
was a shame. They would have 
tasted better fried, I think.
Natrat: Well, thank you all for 
letting me have this oppurtunity 
to talk to you.Blunto, the grizzly bear, searches for the next party.
For this issue, Barneby Jones, a 
Natrat reporter, has been sent out 
to find and talk to some of the 
heaviest drinkers this side of the 
Mississippi. His mission was fi
nally accomplished when he ran 
into a closely knit fraternity of 
brothers. They are more than just 
beer guzzlers and keg killers these 
brothers are truly animals.
Natrat: This is Bamaby Jones 
coming to you live from the sec
tion of the city that is known for 
its party animals: the city zoo. 
Right now, Im talking to the 
animal who is reputed to have 
drunk the most beers in one eve
ning, Blunto, the bear.
Blunto: (Burp) Yeah, I hold the 
record for most beers in one night. 
28 brewskis and still standing.
Frank: (The small white bird 
who has just alighted on top of 
Bluntos head.) Standing. You call 
that standing? This is what he 
was doing. (Frank picks up a leg 
and spins around yelling More 
beer!! In one swift movement, 
Blunto jerks his head to one side 
causing, Frank to fall.)
Frank: That wasnt very nice.
Blunto: Neither was your imi
tation. I wouldnt....
Natrat: Gentlemen, please. 
Lets continue with the interview. 
28 beers is quite a lot. Its more
than a case.
Blunto: More than two cases. I 
was drinking PUBs, not your 
normal twelve ounce beers.
Natrat: What exactly is a PUB?
Blunto: I think that we should 
get Tilt to explain this. He and 
Wyle E. created the PUB.
Frank: Ill get him. Be back in 
a minute. (Frank flies off.)
Natrat: What does the zoo think 
of all of the drinking that goes on 
here?
Blunto: Funny you should 
mention that. Wyle E., One of the 
co-creators of the PUB was kicked 
out of the zoo for violating one of 
the rules. You see the zookeeper 
set up a couple of rules that we 
have to follow if we want to con
tinue having our fraternity.
Natrat: What are some of the 
rules?
Blunto: Well, you cant drink 
while the zoo is open and tourists 
are around. You cant be drunk 
when the zoo is open...
Tilt: (Shouting from a distance) 
AND IF YOU CAN GET AN
OTHER BEER, YOU NEED 
ANOTHER BEER!!
Blunto: Damn straight. Mr. 
Reporter, meet Tilt the penguin.
Natrat: Hello, Tilt. Would you 
care to tell me what a PUB is?
Tilt: A PUB is a penguin unit of 
beer. One day Wyle E. and I
[The lemmings] get drunk and then 
they get real suicidal. At one of their 
first parties, twenty lemmings killed 
themselves after one drink. It wasnt 
pretty they threw themselves at the

A Persons Misquotation
Why is toilet paper square when your butthole is round?
Carnage Mellon fools form club
Eh? A quote? Whats a quote?
- Andrew Airhead
By KILLER BUNNY
Freelance Dude for Hire
A new group has appeared on 
Carnage Mellons campus. A club 
unlike any other. A band of stu
dents from all areas and depart
ments of CMU came together and 
formed The Square Root Club.
Members of the Square Root 
Club are dedicated to acts of ex
treme foolishness and fatal stu
pidity. The only requirement for 
students wishing to join the club 
is that the square root of their 
QPA is higher than their actual 
Q)?A. Students with a 1.00 or 
higher are accepted if they are 
able to prove their extreme stu
pidity in some other way. Among 
the many events that are planned 
are Fraternity Run, Stair Race, 
and Mac Truck Chicken.
Uhhh... Well, I like Frat Run 
the most. Its real cooL Contest
ants run into fraternities during 
Rush, destroy something valu
able, and try to escape without 
getting the #$%* beaten out of 
them. The contestant who can 
make it through the most frats, 
wins. During a practice run last 
sem ester, one guy made it through 
fpur frats, not including A Phi
O., said President Darryl 
Dumbs**t.
When asked about Stair Race, 
Vice President Colleen Clueless 
replied, Gee, I dont really know.
I dont know anything about it. I 
think that it has to do with stairs 
or something. How about asking 
Whats-his-name? Hey you! Do 
you know anything about Stair 
Race?
Whats-his-name replied, 
Yeah, thats where we all race 
down the stairs in Wean. Dont 
tell anyone, but Im gonna beat 
everyone else by jumping down 
Architects Leap.
You idiot, youll kill yourself if 
you do that, warned Clueless.
Dont worry, Ive calculated 
what my final velocity will be 
using a bunch of physics equa
tions, said Whats-his-name. 
Ill be safe. Whats-his-name 
later admitted to failing physics.
Brian Brainless commented on 
Mac Truck Chicken, Now thats 
a real mans game. A bunch of us 
are going down to Forbes and 
wait around for a real big BIG 
truck and jump in front of it. The 
last person to get out of its way 
wins.
Another member of The Square 
Root Club kept on repeating, 
Purple is most cool... No one 
seemed to know why.
Unfortunately, all twenty seven
members of the club are currently 
on probation and few are plan
ning to return next semester. The 
one member that was not on pro
bation was the late Bobby 
I-get-my-rocks-off-on-stress 
Bigbrains. Bigbrains was the only 
member in the history of the club 
to have a QPA over 1.00, but was 
allowed into the club because he 
was carrying 132 units, an act 
that was unanimously agreed 
upon as being extremely foolish 
by club members.
Sadly, Bigbrains spontaneously 
imploded while trying to study 
for seven exams, writing three 
papers, and transposing the tuba 
part of a symphony from the key 
of F to A double flat minor while 
creating an oil on canvas painting 
on the theme Electric Blue Fer
rets with his left foot.
It was such a shock. We were 
all so surprised. I think it might 
have been all that stress, said 
Clueless.
Last week, the club posthu
mously honored Bigbrains with 
the Stupid Act OfThe Year Award. 
Andrew Airhead, a close friend of 
Bigbrain, commented, Eh? A 
quote? Whats a quote?
So you can make origami Its a geometry thing. How What? My butthole is round? Because round sheets would Would not the question be more Huh?!

reviews beers as he travels 
around the world.
Last Saturday, Kentucky 
Fred, famed explorer, alcoholic, 
pinball player, bullfighter, racecar driver, skydiver, backgam
mon avid, Led Zepplin fan, beer 
reviewer and all around pretty 
cool guy presented his awardwinning lecture on swordplay 
to a packed Ballroom.
The lecture started with a 
demonstration of what Fred 
likes to call, King of Mount 
Olympus. He gets on top of a 
wooden platform and declares 
himself King. Then I hit any
body that comes near me with 
my Nerf sword. The secret to 
my winning is the fact that I 
have coated the Nerf sword with 
an inch thick layer of steel. It 
fools everybody. So far, seven 
peoople have been taken to the 
hospital due to injuries received, 
but according to Fred no one 
has figured out about the coat
ing of steel on the Nerf sword.
Fred stated that he liked to 
do this ever since his good friend
Buck was killed. Buck and Fred 
used to watch Bugs Bunny car
toons togethor when they were 
kids. During one of Bugs esca
pades he was engaged in a swordfight with Elmer Fudd. Buck 
looked like Elmer Fudd, so he 
played Fudd and I played Bugs 
Bunny.
Last year, in a tragic accident 
Buck was killed. Buck got an
other one of his sudden urges to 
go bunji jumping. Fred couldnt 
stop him and Buck miscalculated 
the height of the bridge. He
slammed into a cart full of grain 
and was instantly killed in the 
infamous Buckwheat accident.
To relieve his grief, Fred now 
swordfights with everyone he 
comes across, most of whom end 
up getting hurt.
Buck was such a good friend 
in addition to being anal. He 
was so anal that every two 
weeks he used to iron his shoe
laces. Fred closed his lecture 
with that statement and there 
was not a dry face in the ball
room.

Callahan seen here with a really, really big gun.
Entire Brady clan slain by mad killer
By STONED PICKAXE
Natrat Detracting Editor
As police reports slowly come 
in and details become available 
to the public, it becomes agoniz
ingly clear that one of Americas 
richest treasures is no longer 
with us. The Bradys are dead.
Most recently seen on their 
fYes, were STILL here! tour, 
the Bradys had been delighting 
kudiences worldwide with their 
touching portrayal of the crises 
of a family making the adjust
ment from dippy sixties sitcom 
0 dippy nineties has-beens. 
Most recently seen in Tus
caloosa, Mississippi, the Bradys 
had been garnering rave re
views from critics everywhere.
I stayed awake through the whole 
thing  I didnt even use my 
Walkman, said Roger Ebert, 
world renowned critic. I havent 
had so much fun since traction, 
said Gene Shalit, nationally 
known loony.
From scattered news reports 
and confidential interviews with 
eye-witnesses, it has become 
apparent that the Bradys were 
killed by an employee of the 
Nielsen Rating service, an upper 
level manager employed in the 
Good TV division. According to a 
highly placed source, who wishes 
to remain anonymous (but whose 
initials are T.J.) the employee, 
known only by the nickname he 
gained through a USA Today 
headline, the Big Bad Brady
Buster, was terrified that the 
Bradys tour might lead to a suc
cessful comeback.
He had to be hospitalized dur
ing the Brady Reunion special, 
according to an unnamed source 
(who isnt T.J.) he just couldnt 
handle the thought of the Bradys 
back on television. Apparently he 
had a traumatic childhood  his 
mother always compared him to 
Peter, and never let him forget 
that he wasnt as good as Peter. 
He had Peter envy.
The killer apparently used sev
eral Barf and Swill baconcheesepucks as the murder weap
ons. The snacks were terrifying, 
deadly  nothing could have 
stopped them, said one of the 
first policemen on the scene, who
also wishes to remain anonymous 
(but is a friend of T.J.s) There 
wasnt much left of them, after
wards. It was horrible.
The effect of this tragedy on the 
American conscious is impossible 
to measure, due to the seeming 
lack of interest. Newscams dis
patched to the scene found almost 
complete apathy, even total igno
rance as to just whom the Bradys 
were. Several special reports on 
the The Brady Murder  Death 
During Primetime, and a months 
worth of A Current Affair all had 
to be cancelled, because of an utter 
lack of crying fans, tearing rela
tives, and greedy hangers-on.
According to the major net
works, The Bradys wont be back 
in the fall.
Only days before the slaughter, the happy has-beens line up for their 
last family photo.

The programming staff of 
WCRT has irrefutable proof that 
they have at least one listener.
Last week, SEI janitor Harry 
Callahan cracked under the pres
sure of listening only to WCRT for 
15; straight days and nights, and 
went on a shooting rampage which 
raised WCRTs ratings substan
tially.
According to psychiatric exam
iners, the tuning knob on 
Callahans pocket radio broke off 
last month after a scuffle with 
Wince I. Whine, SEI protestor. 
Unable to afford a new radio, 
Callahan was forced to withstand 
WCRT programming until it
melted his brain.
Eyewitnesses report that Cal
lahan entered the WCRT offices 
at approximately 2:42:17.3 pm on 
Wednesday, brandishing a fully 
loaded .44 Magnum. He ordered 
the program director, station 
manager, and gaffers up against 
a wall, after which he shot them 
all in the head.
They look like head wounds to 
me, said Spittsburgh coroner 
Quincy.
After the shootings, Callahan 
ordered the DJ to give him an 
open microphone, from which he 
asked listeners to call in and 
suggest who the next WCRT staf
fer to be shot should be. The lines 
were flooded; some innovative 
listeners even faxed in their re
quests.
The bloodshed continued until
all but one member of the WCRT 
staff lay dead at Callahans feet. 
Callahan then began broadcast
ing music people actually enjoy 
listening to.
Chief of Campus Security Jim 
LaBaglady was asked to comment 
on the charges that would be 
brought against Callahan. This 
is a tough one, he said. Charges 
we got; we just cant find anyone 
who wants to prosecute.
The FCC sent Callahan a con
gratulatory telegram, and offered 
to waive his requirements for 
obtaining a broadcasting license.
Police were unable to explain 
why the one survivor, who asked 
not to be identified, was spared. 
From his hospital bed, the survi
vor speculated, I think it was 
because I played Misty for him. 
Once.
Same as above.

Joseph Robert reflects on Oscar Fu
JOSEPH ROBERT 
WENDS HIS MERRY 
WAY TO THE QUAINT 
YET UNPRENTIOUS AL 
FRESCO CINEMA 
VIEWED FROM ONES 
AUTOMOBILE 
by Joseph Robert Briggs
It would seem hardly possible 
that another year has gone by 
and that once again I must raise 
up arms against the utter banal
ity of the Academy of Motion Pic
ture Arts and Sciences and its in
sidiously callous award distribu
tion. Films of meaning and por
tent, utter gems, are scorned by 
this grouchy Oscar and must 
limp away into undeserved ob
scurity.
Let me weave an example here, 
if I may be so bold: the award for 
Best Makeup went to (I can scarce 
bear it) that film, that Driving 
Ms. Daisy disaster. Oh, of course
 they made Jess Tandy look
younger than, say, 120 or so! 
Brilliance! Certainly reason 
enough to pass over the makeup 
artistry displayed in Basket Case 
II, where an entire colony of 
mutant freaks went on a fast-food 
binge! No question in my mind!
Shall we forget the triumphs of 
actress Linnea Quigley, whos 
lovely face and remarkable tal
ents have graced the celluloid 
streams of over 60 films? Yes, 
lets dolets contribute another 
feather to the old, half-dead, de
crepit Ms. Tandys cap, and be
stow upon her the Oscar for Best 
Actress. It makes me weep.
Weve got a lifetime achieve
ment award to give to Akira 
Kurosawa, and I dont dispute his 
worth  this is the creator of 
Seven Samurai, after all  and a 
Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, 
but mightnt there be a similar 
award to be found for Tim Curry 
somewhere? Dr. Frank N. Furter, 
that sweet transvestite? The 
devious butler who did it in Clue? 
The heart of Darkness in Legend! 
The mans put his career on the 
line, time and time again, taking 
it out on the proverbial limb, and 
is this the thanks he gets? What is 
GOING ON HERE, ANYWAY?
Ahem.
Speaking of taking things too 
far, the latest example of a 
burgeoning oevure  the appli
ance flick  can now be had on 
home video in the box labeled 
Rugsuckers. If the shoe fits, as 
they say, you still cant vacuum 
the rug with it.
Theres only a few elements of 
the plot relevant to the gentle 
reader, vis a vis:
1) Small alien creatures, three 
of them to be precise, descend to 
Earth with the intent of studying 
the inhabitants. (Like Cocoon, but 
uglier.)
2) Said small creatures scan 
the planet looking for a host that 
they can use as a platform of study. 
(Like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but less slime.)
3) Small creatures make a criti
cal error, mistaking a common 
household vacuum cleaner for an 
actual inhabitant of our planet. 
(Like#. T., but the vacuum cleaner 
is cuter than Drew Barrymore.)
4) Small creatures proceed to 
wreak havoc, mauling humans, 
devouring dogs, and taking a brief 
break for some good old-fashioned 
vacuum fetishism. (Like The 
Good, The Bad, and The Horny, 
but better lighting.)
It must be said, at this junc
ture, that what we have on our 
hands is some extraordinarily well 
done Hoover Fu.
Three breasts (each of the ali
ens has one). Aardvarking with a 
household appliance. Carpet
cleaning. Carpet burns. Carpetsmoulders a little bit. Electrical 
plug up the nose. Appliance fights; 
Arc welding fights. Bag change 
ing. Hand up the vacuum cleanerDirtFu. Hoover Fu. ElectroHome 
Fu. Alien-broom-jockey Fuv 
Quaint Yet Unpretentious Alv 
Fresco Cinema Viewed Froip, 
Ones Automobile Academy 
Awards for the aliens, for saying, 
Are you sure this is an organic; 
being? and for speaking perfect' 
English with Jamaican accents; 
Sally Swizzle, the aardvarking 
victim, for doing the cleaning in a 
red silk teddy and for saying, My.!  
This vacuum handle feels awfully 
warm!; John Newwoman, as the 
priest who tries to exorcise the 
vacuum, for saying, We don't 
usually get demonic possessions 
this late in the season and Are1 
you sure its the vacuum cleaner?! 
Maybe your whole house jsj  
haunted right before the vacuum 
mauls him; and Chuckie, tjie 
director, for finally getting , 
real feelings about his mother out 
in the open.
Four stars. Joseph Robert says ; 
Make some time to see this one; 
its a definite hit.
Joseph Robert Briggs is the \ 
roving cinema critic of The Natrat.

next year.
