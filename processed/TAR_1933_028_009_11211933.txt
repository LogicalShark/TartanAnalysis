Credit Wrongly Placed 
For Club Room Design
The Tartan wishes to correct a 
statement in the issue of Novem
ber 7 saying that Professor Kostellow designed the Faculty Club 
Room. In fairness to all contribu
tors of services, it is felt that the 
impression should he corrected 
that any individual person or de
partment is responsible for the 
work.
The building changes, the inte
rior arrangements, and the land
scaping were designed, developed 
into working drawings, and the con
struction supervised by members 
of the architectural faculty. The 
faculty of the Department of Paint
ing and Design was responsible for 
the selection of color schemes.
)5CO Copies of Tartan Distributed 
Weekly in 27th Year of Publication
By ANNA LADD
This year marks the twentyventli year of the publication of 
Tartan. The circulation figres show a total of about 6,500 
copies distributed each week, 2,700 
going to the day students, and the 
remainder going to night students 
Ind alumni. The "Tartan not 
Ivnly reaches students from many 
jliiTerent states, but is sent each 
,veek to former students and as
sociates in every state of the 
'niion as well as Canada and Porto 
Rico. The Tartan is also exhanged with most of the leading 
'ollege papers in the United 
ates.
It is interesting to trace the deelopment of the Tartan from 
*>e original 9x12, eight page, three 
column paper to its present size 
|anr/# style. It is also interesting to 
gJote'HAe growth of the circulation 
'roin approximately 600 the first 
<ir to the present circulation of 
*500 each week.
First Issue In 1906 
The first issue of the paper was 
iblished on October 24, 1906, with 
'rederic E. Foster 08 as editor-inlief. Distribution was made only 
rough subscriptions at $1.00 a 
ar of five cents a copy, 
he three columns of the paper 
sisted of short articles and ad
vertisements. Heads were not 
prominent in the early issues; 
each article was merely proceeded 
by a simple statement designating 
the contents of the article. In the 
December issue . of that year 
heads became more prominent, 
although they wepe still very sim
ple in structure. The Tartan 
appeared in small, inconspicuous 
letters at the top of the front page.
Articles were not written by any 
assigned reporters who did the 
work each week; but they were 
contributed by any interested per
son, the best ones being selected 
and published.
Magazine Form Used
In 1909 the paper was published 
in a magazine-like style. The cov
er was headed by The Tartan in 
large letters in a rectangular plaid 
background, and a picture was pre
sented beneath. At first the pic
ture was of some member of the 
faculty, but later one of some 
Pittsburgh mill was substituted. 
The subscription price was raised 
to $2.00 a year or ten cents a copy. 
The paper consisted of from twelve 
to sixteen pages.
Due to the small circulation of 
the paper, in 1911 the faculty and 
students felt it was necessary to 
do something to increase it. It was

Scotch Ready 
For New York 
Grid Invasion
CarnegieStudents Are 
Hopeful of Seeing 
N.Y.U. Humbled
TARTANS EXPECTED 
TO DEFEAT VIOLETS
New Yorkers Are Old Jinx 
Of Skibos; Ilarpster 
Seeks Revenge
One dark Saturday afternoon In 
November, 192S, Howard Harpster 
stood in his position as safety man 
for the Carnegie Tech Tartans and 
saw his dream of a national cham
pionship go slimmering in the 
dusk, as Ken Strong and his mates 
from N. Y. U. ran rough-shod over 
his team.
Saturday Harpster will have an
other cliack at his old nemesis, but 
it will be from the bench that he 
will have to guide the destinies of 
his team this time.
This Saturday will mark the 
eighth time that N. Y. U. will have 
met. Carnegie on the gridiron. In 
ony one game has the Plaid 
eme. ged victorious, although the 
Tartans have been th favorites al
most every year.
Hundreds of students are ex
pected to make the annual pil
grimage to the metropolis in an
ticipation of a victory that has 
never come in the past four year. 
In past seasons the Plaid cheering 
section lias been every bit as po
tent as the followers of the Violet 
jersied cohorts.
Carnegie Favored 
Again this year the Sldbo war
rior are the favorites. New 
York U., beaten by West 
Virginia Wesleyan, Colgate, Geor
gia, and Fordham and tied by 
Rutgers, is given little chance to 
beat the team that humbled Tem
ple and Notre Dame, but past parformances mean little in this game 
of football.
Tartans in Shape 
The Scotch team should be well 
vested after their romp over 
Georgetown last week, although 
the reserves are pretty well batter
ed from the rough reception given 
them by some of the Hoyas.
Special railway rates have been 
obtained for students making this 
trip, and tickets may be obtained 
for only a fraction of the box of
fice price.
Lineup Unchanged 
The Carnegie starting lineup 
will probably be the same as 
usual with Stewart and either Lew
is of Goodridge at the terminals, 
Croft and Doloway at the tackles, 
Iieinzer and Burzio in the guard 
holes, Trbovitch at center, and C. 
Spisalc or Bevevino, Terebus, Vorderberg, and Mihm in the backfield.
Seventh Annual 
Dollar Day Drive 
Begins Tuesday
Next Tuesday, the day on which 
the Carnegie Day exercises will be 
held, will also be Alumni Dollar 
Day. On this day each alumnus 
will be afforded a chance to con
tribute one dollar or more to the 
Carnegie Endowment Fund.
Dollar Day has become an an
nual event at Carnegie, as it has 
been observed for the last six 
jrears. The largest amount con
tributed any year was about $700 
but last year the amount fell off 
in a very disappointing way. The 
Alumni Federation hopes that this 
year a come-back can be made, and 
that this years results will break 
all previous records.
Endowment Fund Gets Money 
Contributions to the Dollar Day 
fund are turned over to the .Car
negie Tech Endowment Committee 
and come under the two-for-one 
agreement with the Carnegie Cor
poration. This agreement is that 
for every dollar raised by 1946 for 
the Carnegie Tech Endowment 
Fund they will give the school two 
dollars, provided four million dol
lars has been raised.
Between now and 1946 the money 
collected will be invested and will 
draw interest, so that one dollar 
contributed now will amount to 
five dollars in 1946 when the Car
negie Corporation has doubled the 
four millions collected. Alumni 
and friends of Carnegie are urged 
to take advantage of this ability to 
increase their money so greatly 
and contribute a small amount to 
the Endowment Fund now instead 
of waiting until later when they 
will have to give a great deal more 
to achieve the same results.
Any Amount Acceptable 
In drawing up the original plan 
five years ago the Alumni Federa
tion selected the amount of one 
dollar because it is low enough 
that it does not inconvenience any
one and yet it is large enough to 
make a considerable sum. Al
though one dollar is the amount 
each person should contribute to 
make the drive a success, any 
amount, either above or below one 
dollar may be given.
The only weakness of the plan is 
that some persons who have al
ready decided to send in a dollar 
may put it off and then forget it. 
To do away with such a pro
cedure, send your dollar in the 
next mail. Checks should be made 
payable to the Alumni Federation 
and addressed to the Alumni Office.
Signal Flags Announce 
R. O. T. C. Schedules
In the future special signal flags, 
flying from the school pole, will 
aunounce drills to the members 
of the R. O. T. C. The flags will 
appear at 11:30 A. M. on drill day.
A red flag with a square white 
center will indicate that the mem
bers of all four classes should re
port to the class rooms, while a 
white flag with a square red cen
ter will mean that there will he 
neither drill nor class room ses
sions. If no flag appears, a regu
lar outdoor drill will be held. This 
system will do away with all un
certainty as to drill schedules.

Orchestra To Be 
Guests at Recital
On Saturday evening, November 
25, Carnegies Student Orchestra, 
under the direction of J. Vick 
OBrien, will be the guest of Mar
shall Bidwrell, organist of Carilegie 
Music Hall, in his regular Satur

who was chosen to succeed Dr. 
Charles Heinroth in this position 
last year, gives two concerts each 
week, Saturday evening at 8:15,

o'clock. These concerts are free 
to the public.
This year Mr, Bidwell plans to 
havrf special guest groups to assist 
him from time to time as a part of 
the Saturday programs, a plan 
which will make Ills recitals of 
more general interest, and one 
which will help to bring into prom
inence the little-known hut worthy 
musical groups of this city.
Prof. J. Vick OBrien and his or

Student Officers Making 
Thorough Canvass 
Of Colleges
GOAL IS STILL FAR 
FROM REALIZATION
Money Will Be Distributed 
Among 77 Associations 
In Allegheny County
Carnegies Welfare Drive, which 
opened on campus last Wednesday, 
has collected $100 in four days of 
campaigning. The four colleges are 
being thoroughly canvassed by stu
dent wqrkers, and progress in the 
amount of contributions . is being 
recorded on the thermometer chart 
located above the entrance to the 
Commons.
Drive Ends Nov. 24.
The drive on campus will con
tinue until Friday, November 24. 
Each year Carnegie lms contri
buted several thousand dollars to 
the county Welfare Drive and ac
cording to Jean RItzel, general 
chairman of the Carnegie drive, 
students are cooperating this year 
with commendable enthusiasm. 
However, the amount of $3,151, 
which was Carnegies contribution 
to the county Drive lust year, is 
still far from realization.
The V^elfare Drive of Allegheny 
County, which opened on Novem
ber 13, has already raised nearly 
half of its quota of $2,837,980.30. 
On Friday, November 17, the fund 
had reached $1,351,000. Of this 
amount, all the collogos in the 
county, together with the em
ployees division, have contributed 
$17,000, which Is half of the total 
of last year. The special division, 
composed largely of individual 
donors, has raised .$631,000; the 
corporations division reports a re
turn of $442,000. The success of 
the Drive in Allegheny County de
pends largely upon the success of 
these three divisions to reach 
their quota.
77 Agencies Get Money
The money raised by tho Wel
fare Drive will bo distributed 
among tho seventy-seven agonclos 
Uj Allegheny .County, for use in 
"completing their budgets for the 
year 1934. These agonclos Include 
prlvato relief organizations, neigh
borhood sottlemonts, hospitals, 
clinics, public health nursing, 
homes for children and agod peo
ples, and Y. M. C. A.s. Slnco un
employment cases nro being talcen 
cure of my state and fodonil funds, 
none of tho money ralsod by tho 
Welfare Drivo will bo usod for un
employment rollef.
For tho past four yoars, tho sorvices of theso wolfaro agonclos have 
been steadily incroaslng, while tho 
mojiey they have had to oxpond 
has boen decreasing. Although tho 
unemployment situation Is not so 
critical as It has boon during recont years, agencies must continuo 
their Avork of maintaining tho 
morale of the unemployed. So far, 
the workors have received excel
lent cooperation in their work.
Intramural Board 
Prepares Plans
The organization meeting of the 
Carnegie Intramural Athletic Roar'd 
was held last Monday for the pur
pose of preparing a set of tenta
tive plans for the annual intra
mural basketball tournament, and 
for the boxing tournament which 
will be inaugurated as an intra
mural sport this year.
Intramural competition has be
come so keen that it is now one 
of the major athletic interests at 
Carnegie. Its importance has been 
fully recognized by the Depart
ment of Physical Education, and 
the members of the staff are co
operating in every way possible to 
promote this type of competition.
There are already seventy-five 
candidates for the boxing tourna
ment which will be run off some 
time after the Thanksgiving re
cess. Each one of them is receiv
ing individual instruction "in the 
manly art of self-defense by the 
boxing coach, Ernie Sesto.
The newly chosen officers of the 
Carnegie Tntramural Athletic Board 
for 1933-34 are as follows: W.
Bradley Edelblut, president; Fran
cis J. Staudt, secretary; Coach 
Pisedorf, treasurer; and Dr. Marks,

dent in the Department of Drama,

Realistic Paintings in International 
Not as Popular as Cubistic Puzzles
By JANE LIVINGSTON
People, it is known, are attracted 
to the unusual. Even in painting 
this fact seems to hold good, for
th is year the International Art Ex
hibit pleases the public, and while 
Individuals strolling through the 
galleries exclaim happily at 
the absence of those queer canvases 
out of which one can make neither 
head nor tall, the attendance is 
not as largo as in previous years. 
Apparently, in order to draw the 
crowds, art directors must keep 
their collections half a jump ahead 
of the audience, and select their 
pieces with an eyo to cross word 
puzzles in oils,
Pictorial PIctureo
Whether these artists are 
falcon or not. Is difficult; to deter
mine. Their followors acclaim them 
as masters, but It Is still question
able if It Is their penetration or 
lliolr obscurity that earns them tho 
title. For myself, not being an 
artist, I prefer pictorial pictures. It 
Is an irnmenso relief to recognize 
that the canvas by Abram Poole is 
of a woman In a silver evening 
dress and slippers, whose lips 
have been just freshly carmined, 
or to have the picture of the Lux
embourg Gardens remind one of 
Chevaliers song, In the Park in 
Paris in the Spring.
This year one notices more sun
shine in the pictures, a great many
harbor scenes, and character stud
ies of people in varied moods. 
Dame Laura Knight is represented 
with a stirring portrait of Bernard 
Shaw, and though one admires tho 
gentleman very much, there is a 
suspicion that he looks like a 
thorough-bred farmer.
France Well-Known
France Is always exciting. This 
year lieexhibit includes not only 
Le Sldaner, Matisse and Picasso, 
but also tho first prize. Picassos 
canvas Is called The Greek, and 
someone taking tho title literally 
complained In a class that the cos
tume was not authentic. A whisper 
went around tho room, "Its a Pi
casso, until the chant reached tho 
professor who exclaimed that that 
monochrome thing was never In
tended to bo a correct source for anything.
In Spain nearly everything Is 
violent in color. Tho plcturo, "Pro
cession with tho fanactllpiy set 
faces of the men in clear detail, 
makes ono realize how an Inquisi
tion could flourish there.
Back in the corner of the Italian' 
rooms, is a canvas called ThePublic." which permits us "to see* 
ourselves as others see us. It is 
a drawing of those that view art 
galleries and the section of the 
room seen looks like it might be 
Carnegie Institute, even if the 
bench isnt the same shape.

For the past two years tho Plaid hao put a team on the field that out

Scots have boon noood out. This year tho name situation Is at hand. 
There are few that will givo tho Now Yorkoro an outnldo chanco of

CHICK M1DI3HAN, FORMER HEAD COACH AT N. Y. U., hi truly 
the miracle m/an of modern football, Breaking Into the so*cullod "Big 
Loaguo of college football is a very dlfllcult tusk when you are on 
the outside looking In. Temple, Duquesne, George Washington, Buckjioll, and Duke are examples of colleges that have been trying hard for 
years and huvo had only partial success. Meehan, on the other hand, 
raised N. Y. U. from the pushover class to the ilrsl. rank In almost one 
season. The former Syracuse flush Is Indeed ono of the greatest show
men of our times.* * _ * * * *
THE TWO-YEAR SERIES WITH GEORGETOWN Is now over, and 
moBt people connected with tho toam arc glad of It. It seems as If 
there were plenty of tactics employed that arc not considered ethical 
In football circles, and all In all the game wasn't worth the trouble 
anyway.
The fight that ensued following tho game puts a blot In the wholo 
affair. Placing the blame upon tho Georgetown student body Is prob
ably unfair, for It is usually the rowdies from around the town who 
have never reached the eighth grade that start such degrading brawls.
Mil. FRANK "GOONA-GOONA SANFORD AND MR. DAVID BOYD 
were right in tho thick of things last Saturday. R seems that at tho 
end of the game this pair made a dash for the ball, but Mr. Boyd, at 
least, got very much the worst of the argument. Spectators swarmed 
on the Held and Incidentally swarmed ovor Dave. When the mob 
wus finally dispersed by the gendarmes, Mr. Boyd was found on the 
bottom of the heap muttering strange phrases to all and sundry.*** + *>!.
THE CASUALTIES AMONG THE NATION'S ELITE continued to bo 
terrific last week. Princeton and Duke arc the last of the major 
schools who have untarnished records, but neither of these teams play 
sufficiently difficult schedules to bo considered for the national cham
pionship. The same might bo said for the Army, whom I should have 
mentioned above. Army,, Incidentally, plays more setups than any 
toam in the country. This is probably due to political pressure, as 
may be scon from the sections of the country from which these set
ups come.
Those periodical "upsets" prove the futility of attempting to pick 
a national champion for any particular year. There are always about 
eight or nine teams In the country of about equal strength if they 
could be at their peak for every game.* * * * * *

Tartans Never Threatened 
J3ut Losers Put Up 
Siili Defense
The Carnegie football team came 
through lust Saturday to take 
Georgetown with a 19-0 count in 
one of the toughest football games 
ever played lu the history of the 
Pittsburgh Institution. The second 
stringers started the game and 
played practically the whole route 
with the exception of occasional 
substitutes. Slugging, kicking, pil
ing on and other unethical tactics 
ran rampant as the bigger, tougher 
Moyas attempted to beat the light
er, faster Turtalns by brute 
strength. However the superior 
coaching and playing of the Plaid 
broke through to make it a deci
sive win.
Carnegie Players Injured 
No one on the Tech. squad came 
out of the game unbruised and 
some of the boys were rather bad
ly injured. .Johnny Anderson, light 
Carnegie guard, was hurt when the 
.spectators swarmed onto the field 
when he and Forsmnn attempted 
to recover a Georgetown fumble. 
He was kicked In the face and gen
erally booted around. OToole, one 
of the toughest men on the Plaid 
squad wus luid out completely as 
was Sayles after a pileup on a 
line plunge. Spencer will,, be out 
for  the rest of the season with a 
torn shoulder, while Carlson was 
slightly injured when tackled from 
behind. Bowser, who showed the 
best form that lie has all season 
stood up under a Severe beating 
and several slugglngs and broke 
through for some very pretty runs, 
one of which resulted in the Tar
tans first touchdown.
Carlson Scores 
Spencer scored the second touch
down on a pass from Charley 
Splsuk who did most of Llie pussing, kicking, and quurterbuclcing 
throughput the entire gumo. Curlson wont over for tho lust touch
down on another Hat pass from 
Splsuk and scored nicely after 
Blidestopping a few men on Ills 
way to the lino.
Score Victory 
Over Panther
asses And Long Suns 
Feature Plebe Win 
On Muddy Grid
The Carnegie Tech freshmen 
were victorious over the UniyerH^ty of Pittsburgh frosh last Sat
urday morning In the Tech Bowl, 
making their total victories three, 
and attaining a record undefeated 
and untied for their entire seas6n, of which the game with Pitt 
marked the final skirmish. The 
score which the Plebes attained in 
the muddy melee against the 
Panther cubs was 12-G, an exact 
reversal of the score for same 
game last year. The year before 
last the game ended in a tie.
Saturdays game was marked by 
a number of long runs, usually re
sulting from passes by each of the 
contending aerial attacks. James 
of 'Carnegie, attempted the first 
score by running the ball 45 yards 
to touch it over the Panther goal, 
after receiving a pass, but he was 
called back. The first score was 
obtained by ONeil of Pitt, who 
raced G9 yards down the field 
after receiving a well executed 
pass from Isalle. This play oc
curred in the second quarter, as 
did the two scoring plays executed 
by the Tech freshmen which fol
lowed.
In another attempt to score 
through the aerial attack, ONeil 
threw a pass which was intercepted 
by Kopscak, Tech, who ran the ball 
for 72 yards to tie the. score. Short
ly after Greeen of Tech. w'inged a 
'10-yard pass to McGee, which gave 
the Tartan frosh the winning touch
down. The rest of the game was 
scoreless, and the second half 
passed without either team show 
Ing spectacularly except to push 
the other through the mud for 
short, unimportant gains.
OREGON BEATEN
The already defeated U. S. C, 
eleven took another of the leading 
West Coast teams out of the pic
ture by springing a big surprise 
win over Oregon, previously the 
most powerful AVestern contender 
for the Nutioiiul Chumpionshlp. 
Other upsets came when Auburn 
took Georgia, i-lG, and Minnesota 
hold Michigan. 0-0.
Saturday proved to be the Water
loo for most of this season's lead
ing aspirants to. the Rose B6wl. 
Some of the supposedly most pow
erful teams in the country fell in 
the biggest upsets seen in many
years.
Of the past and future opponents 
of Carnegie, several came through 
with surprises, while others ran 
true to expectations. Temple, who 
hitherto has not shown much 
strength, rose up and displayed no 
mean ability when they took over 
the strong AV. & J. eleven by the 
score of 13-0. N. Y. U. played 
along on about an even level with 
Rutgers to finally end up with a 
G-G tie.
Irish Triumph
Notre Dame., after losing four 
straight games, came out of their 
slump temporarily to gain a wellearned victory over Northwestern, 
7-0. Purdue chances for the West
ern Conference championship were 
brought to naught when they were 
crushed by Iowa to the tune of 
13-0.
Pitt ruined the prospects of another hopeful, the Nebraska Corn 
Hiiskers, and brought themselves 
somewhat back into the running 
when they scored a last quarter 
tquchdown to win 6-0.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY. NOVEMBER 21, 19333
Idle Thoughts
ofan
Idle Night 
Student
Well, we were treated to a ses
sion of real winter during the past 
veek. It was sorta soon to liave 
aished out to us such a brand of 
iveather at this time of the year 
when all the big games of the sea
son are at their height. But then, 
;hat shouldn't matter since all the 
jnthusiasts of the pig-skin sit out 
in the elements or have the news 
elayed to them via radio. In one 
:ase you see action and in the 
other you get action.
The snow sorta wrecked our new 
parking scheme a bit. That is, it 
was impossible to see through the 
frozen water down to the white 
lines on the drives, so this led to 
parking between lines, on lines, 
and astride lines. Of course, this 
is excusable under existing condi
tions. Taking everything into con
sideration, it wasnt half bad at 
that. I was able to get a place in 
the snow at night, and that's some
thing.
Initial Council 
Function Will 
Take Place Soon
The first dance held by the Night 
Student Council this year is sched
uled for December 1 in tlie Gym
nasium Auditorium. Coming as it 
does in about the middle of the 
first semester, the dance will pro
vide a welcome relief to the night 
students. The good time that 
everyone always has at these af
fairs is almost as much a tradition 
as the Thanksgiving Recess Dance 
itself.
Always well attended, the Coun
cil dances are widely known, both 
on and off the campus, and, from 
present indications, the coming 
dance will increase the popularity 
of these functions. For it is 
whispered about that the Night 
Student Council has planned care
fully, and well, to make this dance 
the standard by which all others 
are to be judged. The usual ap
propriate decorations, good music, 
refreshments, efficient checking 
service . and convenient parking 
are all further inducements.
Be sure to attend and bring all 
the friends you can. They will 
thoroughly enjoy themselves. Buy 
your tickets from one of the stu
dent salesmen if possible, and 
help him or her to earn points to
ward his Insignia award.
While the snow didnt wreck the 
parking scheme, it did, that is the 
cold, have a good deal to do with 
the temperature of the class-rooms 
and shops. It is true that a tem
perate climate stimulates thought, 
etc., etc., but it is also true that a 
cold room is anything but con
ducive to quick thinking, especial
ly if one happens to be on the 
spot. Even in the class-rooms 
where considerable hot air is 
generated, the past week demon
strated that an auxiliary method of 
steaming up the atmosphere to 
make the rooms a bit more com
fortable is necessary. I tell you on 
some of the nights one could easily 
imagine himself at the North Pole, 
erliaps, it was because the sun 
iad set and the moon was in the 
scendency. At all events, lets 
have more heat in the pipes.
! suppose.all is quiet now on the 
epicurean horizon since the verbal 
battle over What Price Food has 
subsided. While the battle raged 
my gastronomic proclivities be
came unduly whetted and I deveKoped a keen appetite. I was also 
watching from the side line and 
expected a batter of Baked Beans 
or sumpina sorta diversion from 
the tea party of colonial days., 
when all at once the clouds of war 
cleared and the Commons can 
now go merrily on serving viands 
to the citizens of the campus.
Efforts are being made at the 
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO to
ward desnobbing the campus. 
Every student crossing the bridge 
over the lake must shake the 
hands of everyone he meets. So 
far it  has been successful.
A circus with Freshmen as performer-acrobats, lions, trained 
seals, and clowns constitute hazing 
at CONNECTICUT COLLEGE.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT Engineering Hall is 
more or less co-ed now. Now 
will you he-men (?) be good?
THAT the Council has a lot 
of preliminary work to be done 
before their coming dance and 
is looking for helpers. Cmon, 
you workers, send in your 
names.
THAT the Welfare Fund is 
out to fill their budget. Lets 
everybody do our bit, no matter 
how small it is.
THAT big bushy beards be
come stylish again. Well, we 
have recognized the Russians 
havent we?
THAT the politicians are go
ing to allow us to have hard 
stuff, but they can't decide on 
how much, or where, or any
thing else.
THAT the recent cold snap 
caused a great many deaths. 
Millions of moths were frozen 
to death when people took their 
big coats out of storage, or 
hock.
THAT the white parking 
lines don't mean a thing to 
some selfish motorists. They 
straddle two spaces and disre
gard any rules of sportsman
ship.
THAT some poetic souls were 
admiring the campus during the 
last snow fall, it did look beau
tiful but well take a warm cozy 
room any day.
THAT the millennium has 
been reached. One of the boys 
found a woman who has noth
ing to say.
THAT the Turkey family will 
soon have a big pain in the 
neck.
THAT thats that and Ill be 
seenya.
THERES ONE BEST TIME 
To Telephone Ytomei
aliryy agree, once youve tried it, tliat half 
past eight is the time to telephone home.
At half past eight the days rush is over. 
Your time is free for a leisurely telephone 
chat.
At half past eight the same is true at home. 
Its the best time to catch the family all to
gether.
At half past eight (and this is most im
portant) low Night Rates go into effect on 
Station to Station calls. You can then save 
as much as 40% on your call. For example:
If your home is 100 miles away, a three-min
ute connection will cost only 35 cents!
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
oj the LOW NIGHT HATES ...
Call after 8:30 P.M., and be sure to make 
a Station to Station call.
That means, ask the Operator for your 
home telephone, but not for any specific 
person.
If youve fixed a date in advance, the family 
will be sure to be there.
Charges may be reversed.

Registrations 
Show Increase
Figures to Date Almost 
Equal to Total for 
All Last Year
Registration figures now available, 
covering registrations up to and in
cluding November 15, indicate a 
substantial increase over last 
years figures. On the same date 
last year, 569 students were regis
tered in the College of Engineer
ing, 762 in Industries, and 515 in 
the College of Fine Arts, a total of 
1.S46. This year, Engineering 
boasts a total of 691, an increase 
of 122, Industries having 753, a de
crease of 9, and Arts 563, an in
crease of 4S. These figures total 
2,007 registered students for the 
year 1933-34, including part time 
students.
However, the final registration 
figures for 1932-33 totalled 2.0S9, 
including part time students. This 
final figure represents au increase 
of 243 over the total as of Novem
ber 15, 1933. The present years 
total of 2,007 up to November 15, 
1933, is thereCovf) ouly 82 behind 
the final 1932-33 figures.
With these fact3 in mind, it is? 
reasonable to suppose that the final 
figures for 1933-34 will represent a 
decided increase over the registra
tion of last year. This is significant, 
for the trend for the past three or 
four years lias been downward. 
When the final figure is obtained, 
assuming only approximate 250 ad
ditional registrations, this years 
figure will be at least ten per cent 
better than last.
It is especially interesting to note 
that the increase in the College of 
Engineering amounts to approxi
mately 22 per cent, while that of 
the College of Fine Arts is only 9 
per cent. The decrease in tlie Col
lege of Industries is insigni'icant 
on a percentage basis.
It is to be hoped that this in
crease indicates steady reemploy
ment of students who for several 
years have had to forego their stud
ies for financial reasons. It is also 
heartening to note that the confi
dence of the night students has not 
been shaken by the strain they 
have been under for some time, 
due to economic conditions.
Pictures must be handed in with 
themes at NORTHWESTERN UNI
VERSITY so that the professor 
will know whose work he is grading._______
Appointments for 
Plaid Staff Made
Under a new system inaugurated 
by the Plaid this year two students 
have been appointed as Associate 
Editors on the staff. Miss Betty 
Gensamer has been appointed As
sociate Editor from the Night Col
lege of Fine Arts and Mr. G. W. 
Vessels received a similar appoint
ment for the Night College of En
gineering. The appointment of 
Miss Gensamer marks the first time 
that a girl lias become a member 
of the staff since the Plaid became 
a part of the Tartan.
This year the appointmeuts were 
made on a competitive basis. All 
night students interested in jour
nalism were invited to participate 
in open competition and submit ar
ticles for publication. The writing 
ability and seriousness of each 
contestant were carefully noted-and 
a choice was made from this group.
One .position still remains to be 
filled and all students are eligible 
to try out. However all night stu
dents whether members of the statT 
or not, are eligible to submit ar
ticles for publication. All articles 
submitted earn points toward an 
insignia award.
The present members of the Plaid 
staff congratulate Miss Gensamer 
and Mr. Vessels on their appoint
ments. It is hoped that they will 
find their positions a pleasant ex
perience as well as an educational 
one.
When the UNIVERSITY OF AL
ABAMA football team went to New 
York for a game, they carried 
stockings as added equipment, for 
they heard it was to be cold up 
north.
Students Gel Tickets 
For Council Function
Tickets for the Thanksgiving 
Recess Dauce of the Night Student 
Council have been mailed. The 
tickets were sent to those students 
who wish to earn points toward 
their Insignia by selling these 
tickets. This provides an opportuni
ty for the go-getters to pile up a 
comfortable number of tlio points 
necessary to obtain, the coveted 
pin.
The rules governing the sale of 
tickets on the campus wove pub
lished in the last issue of the 
Plaid. They may also be found on 
page 26 of the Handbook. These 
rules must be strictly adhered to. 
Otherwise, all points earned for 
the particular function at which 
the student breaks the rules are 
lost, irrespective of how many 
legitimate sales were made.
Anyone who has not received a 
supply of tickets to sell, and 
wishes to do so is requested to 
send in his name and address to 
the Night Student Council, Box 
136, Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology.
Puppet Rushiiig

Then next number of Puppet will 
be placed on sale during this 
week. The campus comic is get

issue was a sell-out. In the new

TALK FOR TRAINS
O
N a track near Schenectady, a few weeks 
ago, several visiting trade-journaliats sat 
in a test car. From a loudspeaker in this car 
came a running stream of information. The 
voice was that of a G-E engineer in a station 
a half-mile down the track. Sample remarks: 
Believing that we could help railroads to 
speed the movement of freight trains, G.E. 
has now produced this device  a new system 
of communication. Its not radio, but, in 
principle, direct telephony. Its a distant 
cousin of the carrier-current communication 
that power companies use. They talk over 
the power lines; we use the rails, plus any 
wire line along the track. Now, the man in 
the caboose can talk with the man in the cab. 
It also works between trains up to 5 miles 
apart, and between trains and stations. Loud
speaker reception overcomes the train noises. 
Can you hear me all right? They could. 
Dr. Ernst Alexanderson, a G-E Consulting 
Engineer, is responsible for this development, 
lie is a 1900 graduate of the Kungliga Tckniska Hogskolan, Stockholm, Sweden. Inci
dentally, a partial indication of hi8 versatility 
in engineering design will be found in the 
U.S. Patent Ollice, through which ho ha8 been 
granted more than 200 patents.
SMOKE IN THE EYE
AN eye in the stack is worth two on tho 
ground. So thought G-E engineers as fliey 
finished mulling over the smoko-nuisanco 
problem of power and heating plants.
A light source and a photoelectric-relay unit 
were installed in stacks in Chicago and Now 
Jersey. They are so arranged that when the 
stack is clear, light falls on tho phototube; a 
motor or recording instrument registers zero 
smoke density. As tho density increases, tho
phototube receives less light and indicates an 
increase in density. An adjustable electric 
contact is provided to operate an alarm. (A 
running record of the amount of smoke passed 
up the stack can bo obtained by adding u 
recorder.) Thus, the oleetric-eye, which is 
not affected by cinders and is never closed in 
sleep, has found another way to be of service.
Two G-E engineers, W. R. King and Pieter 
Juclitcr, developed this new smokc-dcnsity 
indicator. King is a 28 graduate of the U. of 
Kentucky, and Juchter a 24 graduate of tho 
Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule, 
Zurich, Switzerland.
A RNTGEN WARRIOR
F
OR the doctors who are waging continuous 
warfare against tho dread, lurking specter 
of caucer, G-E research men believe they have 
provided another shining sword. Again they 
nave produced the most powerful x-ray tube 
ever built  this time, for continuous opera
tion in practical cancer therapy at the Mercy 
Hospital, Chicago. Dr. E. E. Charlton, Grinnell College, 13, is the man who directed tho 
production of this tube.
Tho giant tube (brother under tho glass to 
those in your radio) measures more than 14 
feet in length, is rated 000,000 volts, will treat 
patients in a fraction of the time required by 
the last most powerful" one, has x-ray 
radiation equivalent to 875,000,000 worth of 
radium (if tlioro is that much!) and needs 20 
gallons of Lake Michigans coldest water every 
minute to keep cool.
Its a pleasure to make good motors and good 
lamps. Its a greater pleasure to help 
alleviate human illsall in tlio lino 
of duty! More tubes are on tho way.

We Honor the Founder
We pause next Tuesday to observe the birthday oJ! Andrew 
Carnegie. With the passing of each year comes greater reali
zation oJ! the scope of tlie gifts to mankind of the Scot who rose 
from weavers assistant as a young immigrant at a dollar a 
week to be steel master of the world.
Carnegie was Scotch-born but, nevertheless, typically 
American in the age he was building his steel empire. In in
dustry, his was a philosophy of rugged individualism, yet, in 
his philanthropies, he demonstrated a more than superficial in
terest in the well-being of his fellow men.
Upon his retirement from business in 1901, his fortune was 
estimated at a half-billion dollars. By 1912 he announced that 
ho had reduced this to .$25,000,000. He sincerely believed it a 
disgrace to die rich.
Practical that he was, he created the Carnegie Corporation 
of New York to administer his work after his death. The cor
poration included the Endowment for International Peace, the 
Hero Fund Commission, the Fund for the Advancement of 
Teaching, the Institute for the Advancement of Science, and the 
Carnegie Institute ol? Technology.
Andrew Carnegie will be rememberednot because of the 
enormous fortune he builtbut because of: the valuable contri
butions he made to industry and science, to teaching and learn
ing, to peace, and to religion. His courage in introducing the 
Bessemer process into America to change our structural pro
cesses from iron to steel; his untiring devotion to the cause of 
international peace; his influence in promoting friendly rela
tions between tho American and English peoplo; his contribu
tions to the advancement of science; and his steadfast deter
mination to wipe out ignorancethese will serve as an eternal 
m&iuinent to the clever Scot from Dunfermline.
Drop the Georgetown Game
There is no placo for Georgetown on next years football 
schedule. Goorgol;own students demonstrated by their actions 
during Saturdays gamo that tho school has no legitimate ex
cuse for engaging in inliereollegiato sports since tho primo re
quisito for intercollegiate activity is good sportsmanship.
Twico during Saturdays game Georgetown students and 
ehoorloadors invaded the playing Held and assaulted Carnegie 
players, apparently thinking that was tho only way to stop the 
gamo from boing it completo walk-away. Sovoral Carnegie 
players wore badly hurt in I lie riots, one boing unable to con
tinue in tho game. Such actions on a collogo gridiron are alnioNt without procdent in the last ton years,
Tho Georgetown game has novor sorvod a deilnito purpose 
on tho Carnegio schedule. Last year tho Tartans won by a 
score ol? 51 to 0, and this yonr by !I) to 0 although tho second 
and third towns playod most oP the gamo. Tho game has moroly boon a broathor" for Carnegio, serving to preparo tho town 
for harrier games to come. There are hundreds of colleges in 
tho East which will furnish a "breather and will still act 
like good sports when they are beaten.
Some person, or organization, in authority at Georgetown 
will undoubtedly make profuse apologies to the school and tho 
student body for the reception tho Carnegio team received in 
Washington on Saturday. But it is too late to accept apolo
gies. Tho damage has already boon done, and there is nothing 
to prove that similar riots will not occur next year. Thero is 
only ono solutionGeorgetown must not appear on next years 
football schedule.

turn of tho saloons and tho evil

Even the dry must bo consoled 
by tho fact that liquor 1b coming

It 1b logical to expect that tho varloub brows will cost a goodly Bum

What will be the reaction of tho

reign of blind plgB and the speak

ment forcing a strange psychology 
upon us. Laughing at a law which 
our eldero disobeyed (T obviously, 
wo lost a groat deal of our respect 
for law In general. Wo read of 
conventions, congregations of the 
nations leaders which were 
nothing more than orgies. We saw 
liquor served In homes when the 
Constitution said that purchase of 
(ticC commodities was illegal. We 
wondered at first and, as wo grew 
older, laughed with the rest at a 
government (T full of anomalies. It 
wasnt a matter of a gigantic mis
take to us, it was a spectacle of a 
national body trying to enforce a 
regulation which few of its mem
ber wanted enforced.
Now that hard liquor 1h coming 
back, we are in a peculiar position, 
we are of the post-war group. In 
respect to drinking, a nation can 
now bo honest with itself. But 
we're used to being dishonest, to 
hiding evidence and sheltering fel
low offenders.
It would seem, then, that along 
with the resumption of legal liquor 
traffic the government might well 
embark on an educational pro
gram designed to reshape our ideas 
of law and order. Our habit of scof
fing at these forces muBt be over
come. Now that frankness has 
returned to the sale and purchase 
of liquor, the sellers and purchas
ers must be taught the significance 
of this frankness.
None of us who aro now in 
school could have had a proper 
perspective on tho whole affair. 
Somebody made an error and for 
many years tho nations peace suf
fered because of that error. That 
is all. Wo must be given the abil
ity to recognize this fact and to 
dispel the illusion that our gov
ernment, because of one mistake, 
is composed of mistakes.
We do not wish to preach a na
tionalism, but reliance on govern
ment action, as a principle, is in
dispensable to the success of a 
country. We may disagree with a 
particular partys acts, but wo 
must, uphold the right of that par

VANISHING TEAS
The Margaret Morrison Alumnae 
Association is sponsoring a series 
of "Vanishing Teas. At the busi
ness meeting on October 14, this 
plan was discussed and the Asso
ciation voted to start the chain 
with the members of the executive 
hoard who will each entertain 
eight girls. Each of these eight in 
turn will entertain four girls. The 
hostess at each party will charge 
her guests twenty-five cents and 
turn the money over to the Asso
ciation. In tills way, if the chain 
is unbroken, the Association will 
receive $110, an amount which will 
go far to relieve the present strain 
on the treasury.
Each hostess is permitted to en
tertain in any way she chooses. 
If she cares to invite more than the 
specified number Bhe Is welcome to 
do so, but she is asked to see that 
the chain Is unbroken.
Mildred Bastlan, 30, is chair
man of the Vanishing Teas. 
The various womens clans are be
ing asked to cooperate if possible. 
Any Margaret M.orrlson graduate 
who would like to start a chain is 
encouraged to do so. All the par
ties, howover, should be given be
fore Christmas.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CLAN
The clan has been active during 
the past year, holding several stag 
and mixed parties during that 
time. Last month about twenty 
former Carnegio students and 
alumni wore present at a stag par
ty at. tho Jonathan Club, in Los 
Angeles._______________________________
PHILADELPHIA MENS CLAN
A Halloween Frolic was held on 
Saturday, October 28, at the home 
of Mr. and Mrs. Ben Elsenberg, 
1118 Stratford avenue. The pro
gram consisted of dancing, card 
playing and various games. Prizes 
were awarded for the best costume 
and the best card playing.
Plans were made for the meet
ings which will he held during the 
year. A smoker was scheduled for 
the early part of December, a joint 
meeting with the Philadelphia 
Womens Clan for March, and a 
dinner dance for May.
Before the Halloween Frolic the 
Clan published a four-page folder 
called the Techlte News, which 
gave complete details of interest 
to the Clan members. Publication 
of the folder was begun last year 
and will be continued whenever 
there is need for it.
VALLEYS CLAN
The members of the former 
Youngstown Clan were guests at 
the home of James O. Keighley, 
Sharon, Pa., on Friday evening, 
November 11. Twenty-five men 
from Sharon, Farrell, Youngstown, 
and Warren were present.
The name of the clan was 
changed to the Valleys Clan since 
tills seemed more appropriate for 
the wide spread district in the 
Mahoning and Shenango Valleys.
Plans were made for several 
meetings with diversified programs 
for the winter season, one to be a 
joint card party with the Carnegio 
women In tho district.
The following officers were 
elected: Dwight V. Beede, 626
Belmont avenue, Youngstown, pres
ident; Andrew Sage, 1103 Wallis 
avenue, Farrell, vice president; 
Fred C. Beede, 851 Canfield road, 
Youngstown, permanent secretary.
Carnegie graduates in the dis
trict not receiving notices of clan 
meetings are asked to call or 
write either: L. M(. Weed, 805 Elm 
Road, Warren, O.; H. B. Hilde
brand, 195 Ohio street, Sharon, Pa.; 
or Fred C. Beede, permanent sec
retary.
PHILADELPHIA WOMEN'S CLAN

ON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will Lnndsbcrg
Lets make no mistake about 
Soviet Russia.
She stands now, sixteen years 
old, as an economically powerful, 
keen, progressive, go-getting na
tion with government that is un
deniably stable. Her relations with 
most of the nations of Europe are 
friendly and she has contributed 
heavily to international peace. 
From a sleepy, indolent culturally 
backward nation under the Czarist 
regime, she has steadily advanced 
to a position of great importance 
among tho Powers of the world. 
Her unflagging will ana urge to na
tional greatness, the vision of her 
builders, her untold reserves of 
human energy find their equal only 
in America. Russia, 160 million 
vstrong, Is lmlf of Europo and a 
large bulk of Asia. Wo can no 
longer ignoro her.
Thero was little surprlso through
out tho nation last, Friday when it 
was announced that United States 
lias taken tho first stops toward 
formal recognition of Russia. 
There has boon no doubt, that tho 
discussion botwoon Proaldom 
Roosevelt. and the Soviet Commis
sar of Foreign Affairs would re
sult In tho resumption of normal re
lations because tho factors favor
ing it are so obviously greater than 
those opposing, that it .would bo a 
serious error of statesmanship to 
disregard them.
Now that recognition is an estab
lished faot we might bring up tho 
question, "What good has nonrecognition dono anybody? It Is 
true that we do not approve of 
Russias form of government, but 
her political philosophy is no con
cern of ours. The world is now in 
a period of peaceful capitalisticCommunistic existence. Nothing 
threatens American capitaism ex
cept its own failure. There is no 
foreign menace. This is a fund
amental truth and, undoubtedljr, 
President Roosevelt lias grasped it. 
lie has proceeded with foresight
and imagination, and Ills conversa
tions with the Soviets representa
tive, Maxim Litvinoff, have ac
quired tremendous historical sig
nificance.
Primarily, the establishment of 
official contact between America 
and Russia will arrest, to a large 
extent, the earths mad rush to
ward the next war. Recently, the 
structure for international peace 
has been badly shaken. Close com
mercial and political collaboration, 
which must benefit both countries, 
can provide a strong bolster for it. 
And, where America is more per
sonally concerned, we can feel more 
secure about peace on tlio Pacific, 
and have less to fear from Japan, if 
we acknowledge a friefidly atti
tude toward the U. S. S. R.
The question of trade, too, is an 
Important ono. Russia has already 
bought $700,000,000 of Amerloan 
goods. Amlcablo relations bo
twoon tho two countries will do 
much to pi'omoto further and in
crease such a trade. Current, opin
ion tends to exaggerate tho poten
tialities of Russlan-Amorlcan bus
iness, but a fair estimate of what 
I ho Soviet, government needs, and 
can buy, In America during 19JM 
would be about $100,000,000 In 
goods. And experience shows that 
Russia pays her bills willingly, 
faithfully, and punctually.
Also important Is tho attitude of 
tho people. Russian recognition 
lias become rather popular with 
tho business man and average 
American, and opinion, on the 
whole, seems to approve of it. 
Yet, even if the factors favoring 
recognition were not so strong as 
they are, there is still one urgent 
reason why it was a wise move. 
Its simply the fact that when, for 
sixteen years, a nation of 120 mill
ion people on one side of the globe 
are not on speaking terms with a 
nation of 160 million people on the 
other side, then it's, by far, time 
something were done about it.
THE TIPOFF
This time next week the Greeks will be in the 
heat of fraternal battle. An informal explanation 
of the intricacies of Carnegie rushing might be 
apropos.
During the three days before Thanksgiving, 
you le3S fortunate plebes will be contacted by 
fraternity men for dates. After the holidays the 
engagements which you have made will be filled 
via visits to the various houses. You have ex
actly six days to approve or disapprove twenty 
fraternities. Which means that you cant possi
bly pass on more than twelve and do it right.
Were you to talk to a Graybeard who has been 
through the mill and can look back with an im
partial eye, you might hear some advice like 
this:
"Choosing a fraternity is a freshmans first 
major college decision. Unfortunately, the rushee 
is seldom afforded a cold, impartial inspection of 
fraternal life and allowed to make his decision 
calmly. His view of fraternities, by the end of 
the hectic week is at best a kaleidoscopic one.
"The worst evil connected with rushing is old 
high pressure and his best friend, mud-sling
ing. The upperclassman knows all the tricks 
and some of them dont hesitate to use them on 
tho unsuspecting plebes.
The most successful fraternities make rushing 
as quiet and as simple as possible. You meet the 
boys in the house and not their girls. You learn 
about the fraternity (in reasonable doses) rather 
than of the alleged drawbacks of some other 
house.
Our only reason for this dirge is to try to re
duce the number of freshmen who annually get 
sold on something that they really dont want. 
Only a small part of fraternal life is distasteful 
the part which we have tried to explain. Spade 
wouldnt begin to permit a catalog of the numer
ous benefits which you will discover soon enough 
anyway.

IN PASSING
See where the Kilties crashed the center roto 
section in the current College Humor. Beneath 
the picture was the explanation, One of the most 
colorful musical organizations in the collegiate 
world is Carnegie Techs famous Kiltie Band, in 
the Stadium at Pittsburgh." Evidently the edi
tors dont know that its proper to say Pitt 
Stadium."
One of the more closely guarded secrets is 
that one concerning the older of the two M. M. 
sororities which is planning to petition for recog
nition in the very near future.
FASSE
Well, its all over now as far as the Greekesses 
are concerned. The little girls are all established 
and we hope they are satisfied. Theyll be on the 
other end next year.
Some sort of a prize ought to be offered the 
Tri-Gams if they could distinguish the rushees 
from the crashees last Friday night at their 
formal. Sort of a Grand Hotel atmospherepeo
ple coming and going and nobody seemed to 
know what it was all about. Talent in the faculty 
was revealed when Mr. and Mrs. Carroll played 
a very fine duet during the intermission.
Hushed voices and cold stares resulted if you 
attempted to mention Beta Pi at the 3-G affair. 
It seems that the B. P.s threw a scavenger hunt 
(whatever that is) on the same night and sort of 
disrupted the program. The ruffled feathers have 
been smoothed by now, we hope.
The Beta Tau Lambda formal on the follow
ing eve saw old dashing season just about out. 
The original Beetle triumvirateJo iWardell, 
Dotty Marquis and Dotty Vanderpoolwere back 
for the festivities. The high spot of the evening 
came when Bee Archer pinned Dean* Greens 75c 
corsage on one of the rushees. The rest of the 
freshwomenand the Deanhad to be content 
with a 25c posey. Bill Holiday and Evelyn Gam
ble were locked out on the porch for hours and 
didnt even know it.
A STEP FORWARD
Tho ambitious student, look
ing alvad to a successful ca

tion with a roputablo bank
ing institution Is a real stop 
forward. Plan to make such 
a connection while you are
