Peace Treaty Presta Resigns from Senate
by SAMUEL I. EIGHT
Last December, a delegation 
of sixteen students traveled to 
Vietnam. They acted on a man
date of the 23rd National Con
gress of the National Students 
Association (NSA). In Vietnam 
they met with representatives 
of the South Vietnam National 
Union of Students, the North 
Vietnam National Union of Stu
dents, and the South Vietnam 
Liberation Students Union. Out 
of the discussions with Viet
namese students came a docu
mentThe Peoples Peace Treaty.
To develop an understanding 
of the Peace Treaty and to de
velop organizing perspectives, 
a Student and Youth Confer
ence on a Peoples Peace was 
held last weekend, February 
5-7, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
The gathering was sponsored by 
the NSA, the Midwest Peace 
Treaty Coordinating Committee, 
and students at the University of 
Michigan. Approximately twenty 
C-MU students and nearly 
eighty other students and young 
people from Pittsburgh attended 
the conference.
Friday afternoon was devoted 
to registration, caucuses, and 
films. In the evening, after an 
organic food feast, the first 
plenary session was held. Con
ference participants heard 
speeches concerning the up
surge of anti-war activity in the 
cities of South Vietnam and 
within the United States mili
tary. A speaker from the NSA 
delegation to North Vietnam 
said that he encountered no 
hostility in Vietnam. He report
ed that the North Vietnamese 
make a distinction between the 
desires of the American people 
for peace and the acts of aggres
sion committed by the United 
States government. A taped mes
sage was presented from Ma
dame Nguyen Thi Binh of the 
Paris negotiating team of the 
Provisional Revolutionary 
Government of South Vietnam. 
Madame Binh concluded by 
stating: Let us overcome the 
explosions of bombs and shells 
with the voices of justice and 
peace. . . I wish the best suc
cess to your national convention 
and extend you my most affec
tionate and friendly greetings.
On Saturday morning, con
stituency workshops were held 
to exchange ideas dealing with 
ways to organize students, 
workers, women, people of 
color, and other groups of peo
ple around the Peace Treaty. 
After lunch, regional caucuses 
were held. In the regional cau
cuses, people from Pittsburgh 
discussed the events and ideas 
of the conference among them
selves. In the evening, a cultural 
event was organized, with rock 
hands.

Again, the highlight of the 
Student Senate meeting was a 
speech, this time, a disturbing 
statement by Clay Prestia an
nouncing his resignation. His 
anger was a result of what he 
considered to be the inadequate 
handling of the Peoples Peace 
Treaty motion at the Senates 
last meeting. He said:
There was a time several 
years ago when colleges were 
very much isolated from the 
world around them. Obviously, 
this is no longer true. Every 
student is aware of his surround
ing community, nation and the 
world, and many of us are taking 
active roles involving off-campus affairs, trying to relate to 
that environment. If a student 
senate is to honestly respond to 
this student orientation, it has 
a responsibility to extend its 
activities away from purely 
campus matters, and delve into 
every matter in which students 
take an active concern.
Yet this senate seems bent 
on maintaining a parochial or
ientation, oblivious to many 
matters which interest students. 
The facts leading to this state
ment on my part are simple. The 
proposals were presented asking 
senate to step out and take a 
stand behind the anti-war drive 
this spring, which is currently 
being initiated in universities, 
churches, community organiza
tions, labor groups, etc. all 
around the country - which stu
dents in the past have clearly 
supported. Senate had the chance 
to consider the matter. But 
senate copped out - they ignored 
it by summarily tabling it.
Senate could have voted it up or 
down, but this is not important. 
To blatantly refuse to even con
sider the proposal is a complete 
desertion of any responsibility 
to the students of C-MU. If 
senate is to be of any use at all, 
it must consider everything rele
vant. To abrogate this responsi
bility on an issue requiring a 
clear statement of position is abhorrant. Is senate scared of con
troversies? Senates job is to
step out make a clear decision, 
do something, not to retreat 
into trivialities when some
thing important, but controver
sial comes up. It is no wonder 
that interest in student govern
ment is low.
In light of this, I feel my 
membership in this body no 
longer morally represents my 
constituency. To remain is to 
pretend I am doing something 
useful. To best represent my 
constituency I can only resign 
to demonstrate that what a few 
might have thought was hand
ling student concerns is in fact 
a Tuesday afternoon dinner 
club, possessing none of the 
courage and conviction neces
sary to lead. Perhaps somehow 
we can find a way to dynamic
ally and responsibly handle stu
dent affairs. That certainly is 
not Student Senate.
Upon finishing, Clay grabbed 
his coat and walked out, caus
ing nary a stir among his col
leagues, who quickly went on to 
pending business.
An additional matter discussed 
was the Food Service proposal 
to close both Skibo and Mudge 
dining facilities on weekends, 
leaving Morewood to handle all 
students on 7-day food plan. 
This proposal is the result of 
the recent unionization of food 
service employees and the sub
sequent pay raise of $.30 an 
hour. The closing of the two 
facilities should keep contract 
prices lower. (It was acknow
ledged that contract will go up 
next year due to rising food 
costs.)
The reason for maintaining 
Morewood as the sole operat
ing facility is that it is sup
posedly the most efficient and 
therefore the least expensive to 
run of the three areas.
This issue warranted much 
heated discussion, with gradu
ate students and hill dorm resi
dents arguing against the pro
bable hindrances the plan will 
cause them. The motion to sup
port the proposal as it stood 
finally was voted on and passed.

The first Faculty Senate meeting of the Spring Semester, open
ed with Dr. Midanis welcome to Terry Zaluska, Director of the 
Academic Affairs Board, as the first student member on the Senate.
Dr. Daniels of the Hunt Botanical Library (now the Hunt Insti
tute for Botanical Documentation) reported on the activities of the 
center. He cited the increase in collections of the center, originally 
containing 2,900 books, the center now contains 19,000 volumes and 
190 periodicals. Daniels stressed the desire of the Institute to attract 
interest and use by the campus, as its value, he stated, extends be
yond Botany into the fields of Fine Arts, History and Biology. Gale 
Christiansen of the History Dept., is the first recipient of the 
$1,000 Hunt Institute Scholarship. The scholarship, available pri
marily, but not limited to Grad Students, is for any student using the 
library facilities to a great extent in his research.
Next, Professor Reilly gave his progress report on the Educa
tional Policy Council which met six times in the fall semester and 
anticipates eight meetings throughout this spring. They have estab
lished procedures for an annual catalog of grading systems, using 
the general concept of local optionstailoring the grading systems 
to the individual needs of the college.
The chief issue that attracted the large turnout this meeting was 
next on the agenca. Professor Josephs spoke on the Faculty Affairs 
Councils inability to operate effectively and carry out the role 
given to it by the constitution. This function of negotiation has been 
frustratingly plaguing the activn of the Council for awhile, with the 
communication to the administration of the nature of this difficulty 
proving futile. The problem became clearer than ever before recent
ly when President Stever unilaterally decided, without negotiation 
of the Faculty Advisory Council included, to change the benefits 
of Tuition Remission and Faculty scholarship. The council, Dr. 
Josephs stated, asked for a response to their attempt for negotiations 
but were ignored in their request. The following motions of FAC 
was approved by the Senate after a lengthy discussion.
1. The Faculty Senate expresses its strong disapproval and 
criticism of the Administration for its failure to establish an ef
fective dialogue with the Faculty Affairs Council on matters of 
concern to the Faculty and for acting unilaterally to reduce the 
Faculty Scholarship Grant and Remission of Tuition Benefit.
2. The Faculty Affairs Council should not meet until the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Faculty can obtain agreement from the 
Administration on an effective role for the Council, so that fa
culty interests can be represented in the Universitys decisions on 
faculty welfare and benefits.
3. Since the Administration acted unilaterally for reasons not 
explained and for public reasons not acceptable to the Council, the 
Faculty Senate reiterates its support of the constitution of the Fa
culty Scholarship Grant, and Tuition Remission program in accord
ance with the earlier Faculty Senate position.
Important also in the proceedings of the Senate was the pre
sentation, by Dr. Ruth Beach, on the activities of the C-MU Aca
demic Women, organized as the advocate of women at C-MU. (see 
the last two issues of the TARTAN for complete reference on the 
C-MU academic women). The Senate approved a motion to whole
heartedly support the activities of C-MU women, and the adminis
tration, has enabled the C-MU women to begin their plans.
Due to the late hour, the oral reports of the Student Affairs 
Council and the Councils of Research, Polidy and Service, and Plan
ning were omitted, with written documents distributed. The SAC 
cited, among many important items in a lengthy report, its 
concern with the Incorporation of Student Government, and the new 
Student Handbook, (especially the section on drugs.)
Phone Company Develops System to Counter-act the Agnew
by DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
Well, it looks like a lot of 
people will be paying for their 
long distance calls again, as 
Bell-Telephone has finally been 
able to counter-act the Agnew. 
For the very few who havent 
been able to take advantage of 
this ingenious money-saving de
vice either through their own 
possession or their friends for
tune, the namesake of our es
teemed Vice President is a 
mechanically simple, uncompli
cated device enabling its 
owner to have a caller directdial him from anywhere in the 
country (or a pay phone booth 
on local calls) and not suffer the 
ensuing cost. Bell Telephone 
was slightly astonished at the 
simplicity of the Agnew upon 
the confiscation of the little 
thing, having expected a series 
of hookups using Cathode Rays 
and advanced Physics.
Several C-MU students were 
arrested last week for possession 
of the device, their penalty 
the reparations for undetected 
calls due the phone company. 
However, should more Agnews
by caught, the minimum penalty 
is classified as a misdemeanor, 
with FELONY the nice term 
used for your second offense.
With two thousand dollars 
and a band of computers detect
ing a decrease in power fre
quency, Bell Tel has been work
ing hard to detect, follow through, 
and confiscate Agnews (and their 
owners). The C-MU victims had 
been noticed by the tracking de
vices since October, and the new 
crop of 687 distributed to pri
vate numbers last semester are 
said to have been especially
promoted for Agnew detection. 
The phone company has to 
clean up the campus and sur
rounding area of Agnews, so if 
you havent done your Spring 
cleaning yet, it may be a good 
idea to get started quickly.
Another interesting noteif 
your friends have been calling 
you long distance for a long 
time, better start saving your 
pennies whether your Agnew 
is busted or not. As part of the 
all-out-get-them program, an

Page 2THE TARTANThursday, February 11, 1971Midnight Shift Outside the Placements Bureau...
by DOUG CAMPBELL 
Get a crewcut and tell them ...
. . . EACH STUDENT POSSESSES REQUIREMENTS AND AN 
ARRAY OF CAREER ASPIRATIONS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT 
FROM ANOTHERS.
He speaks: Get a crewcut and tell them you want to jump out of
airplanes.
Go Big Al!
THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT, THEREFORE, EACH MIGHT 
HAVE TO EXERT TO ACHIEVE (HIS) GOALS COULD DIFFER 
WIDELY.
4:30 A.M. and Big Al is sitting in a chair he has pushed up against 
the locked Placements Bureau door. 4:30 in the fonking morning! 4:30 
in the Skibo basement!
I wonder what. . .?
ONE LOCAL EFFECT OF THIS ANEMIC JOB MARKET HAS 
BEEN THE FORMING OF LARGE CROWDS OF STUDENTS OUT
SIDE THE PLACEMENTS BUREAU ON TUESDAY AND FRIDAY 
MORNINGS AFTER NEW INTERVIEW NOTICES ARE POSTED.
Eleven students here now: sleeping-bagged, or couched, or floor
ed, or just rippledin the Skibo basement. Its a good wya to get a stiff 
neck ... while you wait outside the Placements Bureau door.
The girl tells Big Al, This is a waste of time.
I dont have anything else to do, he says.
At the same 4:30 in the morning an alumnus of their school is about 
to plunk himself down on the surface of the everlovin Moonright there in the portable color television setand here they are, keeping 
a vigil outside the Placements Bureau for just a chance at a job in
terview.
He even took the schools flag with Him to the Moonhow about 
THAT Mr. Rep for Automotive Dishrag International?but still they 
must make this pilgrimage to the all-night hallway of Job City to . . . 
wait... and hope ... for a chance.
See him? says Big Al pointing to a demented looking soul crouch
ed over a foot-high table, typing his resume one-fingered. Been here 
since ten last night.
I wonder what. . .?
Most of them had been there since midnight. Big Al had come later 
than most. Hes had a couple cups of coffee, and came over around 4:00 
to watch the Moon-landing.
Chairs and couches from down the hall had been moved up to the 
lobby outside the Placements Bureau. The people sitting in the chiars 
are looking quite natural, as if theyre guests in a living room waiting 
for their host to return from a brief absence.
Those sleeping on the couches look awkward but satisfied. Those 
sleeping on the floor look miserable. But those two who brought air 
mattresses, sleeping bags, and Riplle Wine look ... cozy.
Eighty cents a quart. Who-eeeeeee! Ripple Wine ALL night in the 
lobby outside the Placements Bureau in Skibo. Very cozy!
Conversation is infrequent, brief, and low-keyedthoughts and 
enthusiasm having been spent from midnight to three.
Did you interview National Lead?
Yea.
No letter.
What about...?
I think I need a haircut, No Letter interrupts.
A third voice suddenly booms across the hallway, Big Als voice.
OK Big Al!
Backed up against the door, Al looks every bit the veteran job 
seeker. You couldnt get any closer to the Placements Office door than 
Big Al in his chair.
I wonder what. . .?
6:00 A.M.
A pilgrim sleeping on Ripple Wine and an air mattress wakes up 
and sits. Legs and arms crossed, he looks like a zonked Buddha.
Twentieth Century Buddha: Suffering is inseparable from exis
tence, but inward extinction of the self and the senses culminates in a 
state of illumnination beyond both suffering and existence.
Who-eeeeeee! Riple WineExtinction, Culmination, and Illum
ination. Cheaper than Welch-Ade, as costly as Kool-Aid, but taking you 
right beyond suffering and existence . . . and the humming-lighted Ski
bo lobby at 6:00 in the morning.
Sitting against the door, Big Al speaks: Came here last Tuesday 
at 5:30 and was 26th in line.
Well get Chrysler and Goodyear, says No Letter. Maybe P&G, 
dont know about Owens-Corning.
DONT YOU WANT to make fiberglas? Big Al booms.
I can always work for my uncle washing cars.
I can always go back into the army.
Al continues, Two, three years ago you could just wander in and 
get an appointmentP&G and Esso. They always filled up fast, but 
even juniors looking for summer jobs could get an appointment just 
two or three days before the interviewer came. Youd just stop by and 
ask if there was an interview openingthere always wasand youd 
dash over to your tie and put it on, come back, and probably get hired.
But now ... read that letter posted up there ..
BE ASSURED THAT I AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS 
OFFICE SHARE YOUR CONCERN FOR FINDING WAYS OF COP
ING WITH WHAT HAS TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT EMPLOY
MENT MARKET FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES IN MORE THAN 
TWO DECADES.
Most companies are cancelling their appointments, says No 
Letter. And the companies posted arent that great. Thats why there 
arent many people here this morning. Goodyear isnt hiring any Chem 
Es. Chrysler is on strike ...
You mean that YOU DONT WANT to go overseas and work on a 
rubber plantation? says Big Al.
Just what would . . .?
No Letter turns on the TV. Hey fellas, it doesnt work.
Mech Es, Chem Es, Double Es, Civ Es, and a Metallurgist 
swarm upon it, eager to use their technical skills.
Maybe get a temporary job as a repairman. Surgical masks on. 
Place the patient on his tube pleasescrewdriver . . . resistor . . . sodder ... file ...
Hard on the ego this interview hassle.
Sure son, we can use you. How much experience HAVE you had 
with brooms. Oh, youre a Double E! Why yes, were looking for a good 
man in our light bulb replacement operation. Are you familar with 
how they screw in?
The TV. The pilgrims disect and re-assemble it with ease. Anodes, 
dipoles, circuits, orthicon tubes, kinescope, mixer-oscillators, tuners 
and amplifiers all as familar as . . . downtown to a cab driver. Instant 
repair by a team of experts outstanding in their respective fields. Mis
sion Impossible! The set is perfect, better than new. Big Al gives a 
command: Find out about the alfalfa crop in Afghanistan.
But can you get a job?
THE EFFECT OF THE RECESSION UPON JOB OPPORTUNIITIES FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES THIS YEAR HAS BEEN ACUTE.
At 6:30 in the morning there is a lady on TV talking about differ
ential centerfugation. Panic runs through these pilgrims to Job City. 
Whats differential centerfugation? Maybe . . . Im supposed to know 
what that means.
THE INTERVIEW
Mr. Job Giver: Son, I only have one question. What is differential 
centerfugation?
Job Seeker: Well, hmmmmmm, ahhhhhh, you might say ... let me 
... if... gag, choke, gasp, oooooooh ...
FLUSH . . . gurgle, gurgle. Four years + $8,000 + infinite hours 
of study gone . . . gurgle, gurgle . .. down ... gurgle ... the drain, so to 
speak, because of A BAD INTERVIEW.
Buddha, married with one child, clasps his Rippled Chemical En
gineering head. Cheap wine really destroys you the next day. Think 
my head is going to explode. He reaches over and opens the air valve 
on his friends air mattress, and walks away...
I wonder what. . .?
6:40 A.M.
Buddha is back, pacing, head down, clasping the bridge of his nose 
with his thumb and forefinger, and mumbling differential centerfuga
tion disgustedly.
Who won the hockey game? Big Al asks.
The TV program has changed, but no one is watching. This time 
there is a man in a tab collar and shoestring tie sitting behind a desk 
talking with a ferociously animated style. The audio is pure static and 
he sounds as if hes talking through a kazoo. But the video is clear, and 
one can see him rolling his hands out and in, up and down, to the side 
and back, turning his palms up and down, pointing his finger out, and 
hitting the desk for emphasis.
Who is this clown? Theres no studio audience, no panel, no moder
ator, not even any commercials. Just him and his kazoo voice and tab 
collar, waving his hands at the 6:40 channel 10 world.
Channel 10? There is no channel 10!
No Letter has taken the scene in for nearly seven hours, and the 
time has come for him to ask THE question ...
I wonder ... what Albert Camus would say about this?
Nobody would understand it if he did, Big Al answers simply.
Hearing the conversation, Buddha perks up, eager for some facts 
nowmaybe this Camus is a Chem E Professor with some pull.
Who the hell is Albert Camoose? he asks.
Hes the existentialist, says No Letter.
Oh, dont start talking about THAT, Buddha pleads.
For the first time all night everybody laughsexcept No Letter. 
No Letter has a point to make and hes determined to make it.
Hed probably say this is absurd, he suggests, hoping to find the 
same opinion among the others.
But theyre unimpressed. Big 
Deal, Albert Camus. Anyone with 
a half-mole of perception can see 
that this is absurd.
No Letter notices the televi
sions lousy reception and he goes 
to cure it.
No Letter tils the set and stares 
it square in the tube. He touches 
the tuner and moves it . . . one 
notch ... to channel 11, the cor
rect station, and the audio is now 
coming in clearly. Tab Collar 
sounds fine. The programQuest: 
College of the Air. Great, if you 
like 6:30 classes and tab col
lars.
What this country needs is 
more college graduates!
What would Albert Camoose 
say?
Quest: College of the Air, Pro
fessor Tab. Collar and the postSputnik panik. To the Moon . . . 
Mars . . . Pluto . . . Edge of the 
Universe  ahead of Them, and with the school flag.
Mech Es driving cabs, Archi
tects working as draftsmen, 
Chem Es selling brushes, Dou
ble Es sweeping rest rooms . . . 
and Big Al asking his question, 
DONT YOU WANT TO?
7:00 A.M.
New arrivals, expecting to be 
early, find that they are late  
hours late. They are regarded 
with contempt by the vigil-keepers who consider them unsacrificing, lackadaisical pilgrims to 
Job City. The newcomers sense 
this, and go further down the hall 
to sit . . . and wait. While waiting 
they worry that they may not get 
interviews, and blame it on the 
ambitious, night-sacrificing vigilkeepers, describing them as 
NURDS.
8:00 A.M.
There are about 30 pilgrims in 
the lobby now, and they have 
formed in a line according to 
their time of arrival. Thirty is 
really not too many considering 
the way things have been going. 
This is the smallest crowd in 
weeks, and all of them have 
some chance to get an appoint
ment for at least one interview. 
It depends on whether the first 
few in the line decide to sign up 
for an interview with every com 
pany thats posted. THE NURDS.
... I THINK WE WILL ALL 
AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH 
AN INDIVIDUAL AND AS SUCH 
UNIQUE FROM ONE ANOTHER 
. . . THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT, 
THEREFORE, EACH MIGHT 
HAVE TO EXERT TO ACHIEVE 
(HIS) GOALS COULD DIFFER 
WIDELY.

and JACKSON TOWNSEND
Last Saturday evening, we 
had the distinct displeasure 
to be the invited guests of a Mr. 
Ben Gross at his charming din
ner theatre somewhere far away 
from here. Of course, we got 
very lost between the parkway, 
route 30, and Wisconsin; not to 
be discouraging, for let us assure 
you, getting there is all of the 
fun.
To Broadway with Love is 
the reason we went and the rea
son you should go to see a 
movie. It was abominable. They 
gave us four singers with no 
voices, one piano, and forty-sev
en undestroyable Broadway songs 
strung together by the weakest 
of skits and the poorest of dia
logues And they danced, but

not much, and not well which 
may have had something to do 
with the size of the stage. It 
could not have been more than

indeed, seemed the word for

By far, Sunday was the most 
tumultuous day of the week
end. In the morning and early 
afternoon, discussion centered 
around the implementation of 
the treaty. A broad outline was 
accepted, calling for local and 
regional demonstrations this 
spring and summer and with a 
focus on Washington, O.C. the 
first week of May. Around 
2 p.m. a telegram from the PRG 
in Paris was authenticated, con
firming the report that an in
vasion of Laos did include U.S. 
ground troops. At this point, 
discussion shifted to determining 
a response to the invasion. The 
conference participants set Wed
nesday, February 10, as a day 
of national demonstrations. At 
6 p.m., after electing two re
gional representatives to keep 
in touch with a temporary co
ordinating committee, most of 
the Pittsburgh people left Ann 
Arbor.

Seatrain and 
Don Crawford
On Saturday February 20th, 
Sea Train and Don Craw
ford will appear in the Skibo 
Ballroom for two shows, for 
the second Activities Board 
Concert of the semester.
Don Crawford appeared here 
at C-MU for the orientation 
coffee house. His whole act 
centers on the theme of love, 
in one form or another. Early 
iu each performance he asks 
the audience, Would it embarass you terribly if I tell you 
I love you?, after which he 
proceeds to sing Say Can You 
Fancy?. A former journalism 
student, Crawford says that 
money and the best audience 
in the world convinced him to 
join the coffeehouse circuit. 
Since appearing here last Sep
tember, he has been appearing 
at SRO shows all across the coun
try.
In a heavier vein, the main 
attraction will be Seatrain. Sea
train, whose producer George 
Martin (he also produced the 
Beatles) says they are The 
Best, is a group of musicians
with an exciting sound created 
from unusual instrumental com
binations (Jazz flute, electric 
violin and guitar) and diverse 
musical backgrounds. Its mem
bers are Andy Kulberg whose 
musical roots range from classi
cal folk, to rock; Richard Greene, 
whose playing is steeped in 
classieal, bluegrass and country 
styles; Peter Rowan, influenced 
by country and folk; Lloyd Bes
kin, who adds fine rock vocals 
to the groups sound; and Larry 
Atamaniuk, whose roots are 
pure rhythm.
Seatrain plays in a country 
rock style, but not the run of 
the mill type C.R. Rather, they 
employ a wide range of ele
ments from all kinds of music. 
Their music is flowing, soft, 
loyd, gentle, and boisterous, 
all wrapped together. In short 
dynamite!
There will be two shows 
7:30 and 10 o'clock. So get your 
tickets soon, or you might miss 
out on what appears to be the 
fourth straight SRO concert!

The Pittsburgh Playhouse is 
a non-equity community the
atre and I will criticize their 
production of Catch Me If 
You Can accordingly. I en
joyed this comedy murder mys
tery very much and was beauti
fully set up to believe one thing 
by Jack Weinstock and Willie 
Gilbetts clever plot and was 
then taken by complete sur
prise by an amazing twist in 
the ending. The funny lines 
consisted of some stale Jewish 
jokes, but the play also con
tained a smattering of some 
new fresh ones that I had never 
heard before.
Will Disney, (even I had to 
look twice at his name) who 
directed the play and starred 
in it as Inspector Levine, was 
not as good as his wife and her 
entourage, who sat next to me, 
said he was. Disney didnt 
Mickey Mouse around with his 
part and showed a nece flair 
for comedy but his idea of a 
Jewish accent was a Lou Ja
cobi imitation.
Wayne Claren who por
trayed Daniel Corbon does a 
great job of persuading the 
audience of his innocence. 
Soralie Levine who plays Eliza
beth Corbon, is a graduate of 
Carnegie-Mellon Drama De
partment, and she gave me a 
great feeling of relief and se
curity because if I ever bomb 
out in the theatre, I can always 
turn to community theatre. Fa
ther Kellehen and Sidney, who 
were portrayed by Joseph 
Schad and Eddie Steinfeld, 
were the funniest characters 
in the play. Wait, I take that 
back, because the funniest 
thing in the play was the highly 
professional make-up job by 
Bill Thobaben, the pride of 
Point Park College, which con
sisted of a moustache painted 
on by an eyebrow pencil. Way 
to go, Bill.
Im not going to discuss the 
plot because I might give some
thing away and ruin the sur
prise ending. I do highly reccommend that you see Catch 
Me If You Can which will 
run until March 7 at the Pitts
burgh Playhouse.

A meeting of the Academic Af
fairs Board was held on Feb. 4. 
Because of the exceptionally bad 
weather, the turnout was small. 
However, this proved to be an 
advantage, since this allowed us 
to discuss several important issue in depth.
First on the agenda was to 
state our position on the proposed 
total defunding of the Study Skills 
Center. For those of you not familiar with the SSC, it is a service 
to students which offers aid in 
the development of study skills 
(i.e. time management, speed 
reading, etc.) as well as remedial 
help. After an extensiveness (bas
ed on interviews with students, 
faculty, study skills personnel, 
and the information gathered by 
Student Affairs and Educational 
Policy Council) support in favor 
of the center was unanimous. We 
are presently taking steps to see 
that the center remains operation
al in the future.
The AAB now has a new steer
ing committee. Members include
Terri Zaluska, Paula Shubock, 
John Tate, Paul Dworak, and 
Roger DooleyThe reason for 
streamling the steering commit
tee is to make it a more work
able group. You just cant ac
complish much with a committee 
of 35! If you are interested in 
working, give me a call (687- 
7687).
Attention all SAC groups! Each 
department was sent a question
naire as the result of our first 
meeting. Please check with your 
department head to see if it has 
been completed yet. If so, please 
return it to me (Box 2-C-10, MG). 
If not, get busy. Departments on 
the ball are: Economics, Social 
Relations, Painting and Sculp
ture, and Math.
Plans are underway to set up an 
Academic Affairs Office. The pur
pose of this office is to provide a

pose of this office is to provide a

When I heard the first epi
sode of the continuing story of 
The Hard Lucked Love Life 
of Rodney McGluck, the Bumb
ling Lover And All American 
Jerk, I had to think back to 
my college days at Catholic 
University and to all the times 
I bombed out with chicks. Mc
Gluck is the typical C.M.U. 
student who is hornier then the 
Count Basie brass section and 
tries to pick up loose women at 
a Skibo mixer with lines like, 
Dont you know me from some
where, Im a broad jumper, 
are you available? and Until 
I saw you, I thought this was an 
old age home. Rodney quickly 
learns that lines like that only 
work in Archie comic books 
and Im not too sure about these 
either.
Great Neck playwright Glenn 
Super has done it again with his 
witty and fast moving dialogue. 
Super also plays the title role 
of Rodney McGluck and the 
fact that he seems to fit so well 
into the part makes me tend to 
suspect that either hes an ex
cellent actor or really an actual 
bomb with women. But since he 
is setting me up with a blind 
date and paying me off to write 
this review, Id better say that 
hes a good actor. Tom Hegg, 
who portrays Good Old George, 
adds alot of class and experience 
to the part. I wish I had a 
friend like Good Old George 
who would set me up with fast 
women the way he does for 
Rodney. If I did, I would spend 
less time in the bathroom. Fin
ally, Claudia Brant was stunning 
as Mona. I really dug her per
formance and Im dying to meet 
her. If youre by any chance 
reading this Claudia, please send 
me your phone number in 
care of the TARTAN.
Rodney McGluck is far too 
dirty to be a soap opera, but it 
does leave you hanging at the 
end. I now have to tune in next 
week to WRCT/9 for the second 
episode, to see if Rodney ac
tually does it with Mona. I 
hope so.
Tune in next Monday night 
at 11:15 to Supervision Theatre 
on WRCT/9, for part two of 
Rodney McGluck.
point for academic reforms. For 
example, several proposals re
garding an appeals board for aca
demic actions are being worked 
on. When a specific mechanism 
is finally implemented, this is 
where it will come from. Other is
sues will be handled in a similar 
fashion.
The intention behind such an 
office is to guarantee that once 
an issue has been studied, some 
constructive action, if warranted, 
will be taken. It also serves an 
additional effective link for im
proved communications between 
students and faculty, since input 
into the office will come from 
both groups. In addition, it can 
serve as neutral ground to settle 
a particular academic gripe.

O.K. film fans out there in 
reader land, here are some triv
ia questions to challenge your 
late show knowledgeability. 
Since any late show watcher 
worth his six-pack will will
ingly lose any amount of sleep 
to watch a Bogard film, this 
writer will limit this article to 
questions concerning everyones 
favorite actor  Bogie.
1. What was Bogarts full name?
2. Name Bogarts four wives in 
order.
3. What was Bogarts fourth 
wifes real name?
4. In what year and for what 
film did Bogart win the Aca
demy Award for Best Actor?
5. What was the name of Bo
garts last motion picture?
6. What film did Bogart star 
in that was based on a novel 
written by Ernest Hemingway 
and had a screenplay co
authored by William Faulk
ner?
7. What was the name of the 
night club which Bogart ran 
in Casablanca?
8. Who played Sam in Casa
blanca?
9. What was the song which 
Sam was never supposed to 
play?
10. What does Captain Ren
ault toss into the wastebasket 
at the end of Casablanca?
11. What is the name of the 
character which Bogart play
ed in High Sierra?
12. In High Sierra, who plays 
Velma, the crippled girl that 
Bogart helps?
13. What was the name of the 
character Ida Lupino played 
in High Sierra?
14. In which film did Bogart 
play Sam Spade?
15. What was the name of Sam 
Spades partner and who play
ed him?
16. What was the name of the 
character Peter Lorre played 
in The Maltese Falcon?
17. In the film mentioned 
above, Peter Lorre referred 
to the man he worked for as 
the fat man. What was this 
characters real name in the 
film, and who played him?
18. In what film also with a 
screenplay co-authored by 
William Faulkner does Bogart 
play Philip Marlowe?
19 What is the name of 
Philip Marlowes romantic 
interest and who played her?
Now, since those were easy 
enough, heres two more which 
will really separate the Bogart 
fanatics from those who have 
just read one of the numer
ous biographies and have been to one festival.
20. Name the films in which 
Bogart acted with Sidney 
Greensgreet.
21. Name the Bogart films 
which were directed by John 
Huston and/or had a screen
play which Houston wrote 
or collaborated on. For an 
extra challenge, tell who 
Huston collaborated with, if 
anyone, on those screenplays.
Well, gang, thats it. If you 
look closely, youll find the 
answers somewhere in this 
issue, unless of course, there 
wasnt room or they got lost 
somewhere along the line.

GS 71 - Feb. 26-27
Through the magic of the mass 
media (i.e., old newspaper clip
pings), CFP brings you Part II 
in the continuing story, Whats 
heppening on Greek Swing 
Night? Last week we told you 
about Uncle Dirty (bless his 
little mouth . . .). Today, we 
will attempt to expound on the 
musical virtues of Hagood 
Hardy and the Montage, through 
the courtesy of The New York 
Times, The Plain Dealer, The 
Cleveland Press, etc.
What is a Hagood Hardy? 
A candy bar? A new five-ply 
radical tire? How about one of 
those new, vitamin-packed, 
low-calorie breakfast cereals?
Nope. The Hagood Hardy 
Im talking about is the leader 
of one of the most versatile 
musical groups to ever play our 
town.
Hagood Hardy (and the Mon
tage) is a classical pianist from 
Toronto who digs real jazz and 
has turned his hand to both jazz
piano and vibes. Good vibes 
on both  piano and vibraphone. 
The Montage consists of two 
guys on bass and drums, plus 
two gals who duet and solo. 
Its most difficult to bag this 
group and, I agree, comparisons 
are odious but to establish some 
relationship Ill say HH and 
The Montage take up where 
Sergio Mendes and Brasil 66 
leave off. The group is a clean 
compilation of whats happen
ing in commercial jazz today - 
and tommorrow...
. . . . Montage is a good 
name for a good act. Hardy 
has combined youthful jazz 
with svelte sophistication of 
Latin music having the Mendes 
beat. . . The girls, Lynne Mc
Neil and Stephanie Taylor, look 
pretty and sing pretty. Theyre 
well-scrubbed, look more like 
shapely college coeds, and have 
bright, big smiles. When they 
walk off (a practice that should 
be halted), Hardy and two ex
cellent jazzmen, drummer Dave

Indochinese  survival. An 
essential point is by no stretch 
of the imagination are we pro
tecting the Vietnamese from the 
Viet Cong. The Vietnamese 
ARE the Vietcong, that's why 
we are needed to prop up 
Thieu - Ky - Khiem. If the 
Vietnamese wanted to elimin
ate the NLF, all they would 
have to do is point a finger, and 
U.S. forces would demolish 
them. That no fingers are point
ed, that the AEVN refuse to 
fight, that the peasants per
sistently hide and feed Viet
cong forces are votes for the 
NLF. The NLF is reelected 
every day in every way.
Recently there have been 
massive anti-war protests in 
the major cities of South Viet
nam, where protest can be 
lethal. Yet, the cities are the American strongholds; the coun
tryside has been NLF - control
led for years. The NLF even 
has postmen, tax collectors and 
courts oat there. If the strong
holds are protesting, consider 
the mood of the Vietnamese 
people as a whole. If the peo
ple were on our side, we never 
would have had to go in and 
burn their houses and their 
children, dump tons of arsenic 
on their farms and force
fully move thousands to re
fugee camps. A guerilla war 
cannot survive without popular 
support. The guerillas have 
survived.
The Vietnamese have a dream, 
they have a dream of being free 
at last. Free at last after twentyfive years of warfare against 
three powerful nations; France, 
Japan, and the U.S.A. Our gov
ernment is trying to squash that 
dream with over 500 lbs. of 
airborne bombs alone for every 
man, woman, and child in Viet
nam. I have no hatred for the 
peasants of Indochina, no fear.

Editorial
I suppose its Froth-at-the mouth time again, but Im 
losing heart for it. I guess the invasion of Laos was inevitable. 
I mean, thats how you pull troops out, isnt it, by invading 
more countries?
The pains the administration went to to avoid another 
reaction like that which followed Cambodia have been truly 
amazing. First, a news blanket making us the only people in 
the world who didnt know what was going on. Then a care
fully gradual unfolding of the events, never allowing a key
note, never an incident, just proceedings. A coalition of peace 
groups held a news conference last Monday and our free 
press all but ignored it. Senate and house doves sputter in 
their impotence, looking over their shoulders for someone, 
maybe us, to make the first move. Some leadership.
The Pentagon keeps declaring that there are no U.S. 
troops in Laos. The distinction, other that radical, between 
our boys and South Vietnamese troops whom we arm, sup
ply, pay, transport, and command (it was Nixons decision 
to invade) is dubious. But, of course, it is obvious, the racial 
distinction IS the important one. You see, it doesnt matter 
how many gooks die from our mercenary armies and round 
the clock intensive bombing, as long as none of our boys 
die. The Pentagon can use our wealth to kill all the slopes, 
Slants, Charlies, sub-humans they want. They can give 
away all the arms, bomb as much as they want, just no more 
body bags. We can go on raping an entire sub-continent, 
paying the Indochinese to fight among themselves for our 
benefit and its okay, the President says so. Were supposed 
to accept it, just no more body bags and everyones supposed 
to forget that weve gone through two administrations elected 
on an implied promise of peace, only to see the war continue 
to escalate. Kissenger playing Colonel Buck Turgison slam
ming the table, with a glazed look, shouting North Vietnam 
next, then China! And by God, were going to protect our 
boys in Vietnam, and... oh crap Im so sick nf it all.

Editor, the TARTAN:
I would like to correct one 
item in the TARTANs report 
(Jan. 28) of the Senate meeting 
of January 26. The Chess Club 
did not ask for $100 to attract 
the North American Intercol
legiate Championship to THIS 
CAMPUS; rather, we want to 
bring the Championship to 
PITTSBURGH. The Pitt and 
C-MU Chess Clubs are cooper
ating toward this goal, as neither 
one, by itself, could submit a 
competitive bid. If our bid is 
successful, the Championship 
will be held in Oakland, most 
likely at the Webster Hall Hotel. 
Of course, wherever it is held, 
the Championship will be open 
to all C-MU full-time under
graduate and graduate students.

Clean Air Cars
Editor, the TARTAN,
As you well know, the Clean 
Air Car Race was held during 
the summer of 1970. It was an 
attempt to provide answers to 
the pressing problems of air 
pollution through the use of the 
imagination and creativity of 
college students. Many interest
ing concepts were presented 
which warranted further de
velopment. The Clean Air Car 
Race also demonstrated that col
lege students could organize and 
operate an event with a budget 
over one million dollars.
In discussions which followed 
the Clean Air Car Race, it was 
decided that the concept of the 
Clean Air Car Race should be 
carried on. This concept being
that college students should and 
can tackle important social prob
lems. A group of college stu
dents, meeting last December, 
decided that a competition in
volving the design and construc
tion of prototype urban vehicles 
was the best way to carry on 
the concept of the Clean Air 
Car Race. These urban vehicles 
would be small, safe, light
weight, low-pollution vehicles 
designed for the specific driv
ing requirements of the urban 
environment.
Help is needed at this time. 
A committee of students is be
ing formed at the national level 
to organize an urban car compe
tition to be held during the 
summer of 1972. Students with 
qualifications in fields rang
ing from finances to communi
cations to public relations to 
emissions and performance 
testing will be needed from now 
until the conclusion of the com
petition. Help is also needed 
at the campus level. If Car
negie-Mellon University is to 
have an entry in the competi
tion, efforts must begin now. 
Students with qualifications in 
all technical and scientific are 
needed as well as creative to 
design the exterior and interior 
of an urban car.
Interested students should con
tact Frank J. Robb, Box 606E

thing can be done!

Free Vietnam
Dear Editor:
Last weeks TARTAN carried 
an anonymous letter called 
facts. On the whole it was 
an honest expression of opinion.
Yet the author seems to feei 
that the North Vietnamese troops 
whom were born in the South 
are foreigners. Remember, Viet
nam was cut in half in 1954 
ONLY to arrange elections in 
1956. Eisenhower - Nixon pre. 
vented those elections because 
as Eisenhower said, We knew 
we would lose. In any case, 
the North Vietnamese have made 
it clear they would withdraw 
heir troops from their own 
country if we would withdraw 
ours. The Thieu - Ky - Khiem 
regime would lose an election 
against almost anyone.
The anonymous letter goes on 
to ask What sort of govern
ment is the reunified Vietnam 
supposed to have ?. The ans
wer is none of our damn busi
ness. They can have a one  
party, two-party, all night party, 
Communist, Capitalist, or 
Vegetarian system. This is call
ed National Self-Determination. 
It is also called Freedom. If a 
democratically elected govern
ment of South Vietnam chose to 
remain autonomous from the 
North (highly unlikely), they 
certainly should be free to do so, 
but it is not ours to interfere. 
If the Vietnamese people want 
to be free of the American gov
ernment, should we let them, or 
bomb and poison the hell out of 
them as we are now doing?
The last paragraph of that 
anonymous letter does indeed 
get to the heart of the matter. 
This is a war between the 
Americans and the Indochinese 
(Laos and Cambodia are get
ting bombled like nowhere else 
in the world). It is a war fought 
within the permission of the 
American people or Congress 
against the people and the land 
of Indochina. Peace now means 
a substantial victory for the

However...
CMU vs. PITT
Wednesday night the Tartans 
defeated a streaky Western Re
serve squad, 68-64. Frank Sacco 
and Jeff Hollis paced the scoring 
with 17 points apiece.
The Tartans looked like they 
were going to run Reserve off the 
court in the first half as they 
opened up a quick 17-7 lead. 
They were playing a well disci
plined offense, waiting for the 
good shot and Sacco was doing a 
good job on the offensive boards.
However, Western Reserve be
gan to settle down and score 
against the C-MU 1-3-1 zone as 
sophomore Don Goodfellow came 
through with some impressive 
shots. However, a last minute 
scoring basket by C-MU gave 
them a comfortable eight point 
lead at the half, 35-27.
The second half saw the C-MU 
lead alternate between one and 13 
points ... it even disappeared for 
a few seconds.
The Tartans were virtually tradtrading baskets with Reserve 
during the opening minutes of the 
second half while the battle under 
the boards between Sacco and 
WRs Bogo increased in intensity. 
Finally one of Bogos swinging el
bows caught Frank in the face, 
forcing him out of the game mo
mentarily for repairs. The ref 
benevolently called a foul on Bogo 
and Ed Aul hit one of two proxy 
foul shots for Frank. With Sacco 
out of the game Western Reserve 
began to take charge with their 
new found height advantage and 
soon had a 46-45 lead. When Sac
co returned from the locker room 
and re-entered the game the Tar
tans ran up a lead again and were 
ready to coast to victory.
A number of key turnovers gave 
Reserve the chance to catch up 
again while the Tartans tried a 
not too successful freeze to draw 
out the WR defense. But Jeff Hol
lis at the foul line, a layup by Sac
co on a beautiful pass assist from 
Gene Turner and Turners bucket 
gave C-MU their fourth win of 
the season.
Although Gene Turner had an 
off night (for him), in the scor
ing department, the 59 guard 
led the Tartans with 10 rebounds 
and had a number of fine assists.
The Pitt Board of Trustees is 
reffing this game was one of 
the many remarks heard in the 
Pitt Field House by C-MU follow
ers Saturday. Pitt whipped the 
Tartans by 35 points, however, 
the game was not a one-sided af
fair for the first 25 minutes.
The Tartans ignored the Pitt 
height advantage and jumped to a
9-1 lead. Gene Turner and Jeff 
Hollis kept their cool, setting up 
the C-MU offense and harrassing 
Pitt on defense, while Kevin Cot
ter couldnt miss a shot.
It may sound bad to knock the 
officiating, but in this case its 
only being realistic. The poor 
calls were numerous but a few 
cases should illustrate the point. 
Gene Turner was driving up the 
middle when two Pitt players con
verged on himGene was called 
for charging. Buzzy Harrison was 
driving all alone to the hoop. 
Speedy Jeff Hollis angled in from 
the other side of the court and 
cleanly blocked the layup at
tempt. The ref, who was out of 
position on the play, called a foul 
on Hollis.
In addition, Pitts Carl Morris 
was constantly parked under the 
basket while their guards worked 
for an outside shot. But when Cot
ter crossed in the lane for 3.1 
seconds, the violation was called 
on C-MU.
Despite the fact that Turner and 
Hollis had seven fouls between 
them in the first half, Pitt only 
led by four with two minutes to go
in the half. When Cotter released 
a set shot from the corner, seem
ingly just before the buzzer, the 
refs waited until the ball cleanly 
went through the hoopthen sig
naled that the basket was no good, 
since time had run out. So Pitt 
took a 57-47 lead into the lock
er room at the half.
Noteworthy stats in the first 
half are in the rebounding depart
mentPitt grabbed 22 rebounds 
compared to 20 for C-MUs mid
gets. One of the C-MU rebounds 
was pulled down by Gene Turner 
(59)right under the basket 
with Paul OGorek (68) and 
Mike Paul (65) in the immedi
ate vicinity.
In the second half the inevitable 
occurred. With Turner and Hollis 
in foul trouble (thus unable to 
play their normal defensive 
game), Pitt began to increase 
their lead to 15 points. Then Hol
lis picked up his fifth personal 
with 13 minutes to go and Pitt 
put on a press to put the game 
away. Both benches were cleared 
for the last ten minutes of play 
and the only fun left was to see if 
your friends on the bench could 
pick up a few points.
Pitt, with a 10-7 record, in
cluding wins against Davidson, 
Penn State, N. C. State and Duquesne, have one of their best 
teams in years and were heavily 
favored in this game. But this 
was the first time in quite a while 
that a C-MU team has walked out 
onto the Field House court so

Some people have raised ques
tions about the ratings which I 
would like to straighten out in 
this article. First of all, the rat
ings will definitely change from 
week to week based on the per
formances of the teams. Second is \ 
the problem of three teams from ' 
the Bucks League being rated for 
this is simply that, in my opinion, 
these teams all belong in the top 
eight. Talent-wise, there is no 
comparison between the strong 
Bucks League and the incredibly 
weak Celtics League. ATO is the 
only team in the Celts League 
which stands a chance of winning 
even one playoff game. As to the 5- 
second place qualifier from this 
league, Sigma Nu seems to have 
a slight edge over Mr. Aber and 
the Sig Alphs.
As mentioned here two weeks 
ago, Beta Theta Pi has a history 
of being upset by weak teams, 
knocked off Beta A last week.
One of these years the heavily tal
ented Beta teams are going to 
realize that games are not won 
because of an abundance of good 
individual players but by teams 
who can play as a unit. Until then 
the underdogs of the world can re
joice!
Next week the big games for 
playoff positions begin. This col
umn will discuss some of these 
matchups and how things look for 
the all-important playoffs. The ^ 
prediction of the week if for the
E. J. Bruins to top the Oakland 
As by seven points on Tuesday

Fditorial SWIMMING SUMMARY
-R^ A oBR A JL A The C-MU swimming tdam sufhe bowed out complaining of a
There didnt seem to be much need for my editorial comments this 
Week but then I remembered Saturday afternoon. Of all the refereeing 
jobs Ive encountered during my years of playing basketball and just 
going to games, Ive never seen quite the display I witnessed on Satur
dayIts hard to put those refs on an appropriate level, suffice it to say 
Mr. Birdy wouldnt have allowed them to ref a minor league, jag intra
mural basketball game.
There is an intrinsic honesty among ball players no matter how 
the refs or the fans call the play. Jeff Hollis had a fine block on a shot by 
Buzzy Harrison in the first half; needless to say it was called as a foul 
by the ref. Jeff knew it was a clean block, Buzzy knew it was a clean 
block and all the fans did, but the refs decision is final. During half 
time Buzzy made a special effort to see Jeff and compliment him on the 
block and also to apologize for the refereeing.
In my last editorial I mentioned that most of the home court ad
vantage can be the refereeing. In this case it definitely was a factor. It 
doesnt give you much pride in a victory when you know you had the los
ing team outnumbered seven to five. (Fivd players and two refs.)
It seems to me that when the fans protest it, the teams apologize 
tor it and a non-biased large newspaper calls attention to the officiat
ing, it must have been special. My advice would be to drop those two 
referees back to grade school games and let them work their way back 
up to junior high games in about ten years.
Scott Provan, the diver for C-MUs swimming team unfortunately 
missed Saturdays meet. Scott is beating the same divers he competed 
with in past years and is usually a sure first or second. His presence 
gives the whole team a boost.... he alone could have changed the out
come of last Saturdays loss.
The C-MU swimming tdam suf
fered another painful loss last 
Saturday to Case by the close 
score of 61-50. The mermens 
record now stands at 2-6 with four 
remaining meets.
Despite the score, the day did 
show some promising times. 
C-MU started well by winning the 
opening medley relay in 4:16.7 
with a team composed of Dave 
Lowry, co-captain Lloyd Miller, 
Jeff LaRochelle, and Norm Crapster. Co-captain Bob McIntyre 
then stepped in to win the 1000 
yard freestyle in 12:36.9, one of 
his best times of the year. The 
score stood 13-3, C-MU, but Cases 
strong freestylers dominated the 
next two events. Miller finally 
broke through again, winning the 
200 yard individual medley in 
2:24.4. LaRochelle was the next 
Tartan winner, bringing home the 
200 yard butterfly in 2:24.2. The 
score at this point stood 33-27, 
C-MU, but McIntyre was the only 
other Tartan to win, taking the 500 
yard free iu 6:01.0. The meets 
outcome was decided in the last 
relay, with C-MU losing despite a 
valiant effort.
Saturdays meet was particul
arly frustrating because had Scott 
Provan, C-MUs better diver, 
shown up, the meet would have 
been far closer. As it happened,
GOING TO
EUROPE
THIS
SUMMER??
C-MU's Office of Student Activities is trying to determine the number of stu
dents who plan to go to Europe this summer and might be interested in a 
Group Charter rate. We are surveying students at Pitt and Duquesne to see if 
there is enough interest in the Pittsburgh area to charter a plane.
In order to qualify for the lowest possible round trip air fare, a group must go 
over together and come back together and they must also form some kind of 
affinity (i.e. all students at C-MUthree affinities per plane).
We have tentatively set up three flights as follows:
NEW YORK - AMSTERDAM - NEW YORK......................................................................$162.00
Leave June 1............Return August 4
Leave June 7............Return July 8
NEW YORK - LONDON - NEW YORK..................................................................................$1 82.00
Leave July 10............Return September 1
We need to know how many students are interested in any one of these 
flights or whether or not other times or other destinations would be more con
venient.
If you plan to go to Europe ANYTIME this summer and do not have definite 
travel arrangements, stop by the Skibo Inofrmation Desk and fill out a ques
tionnaire. We would like to make a decision no later than March 1.
Special Note:
Those who would qualify include: all STUDENTS, FACULTY, STAFF 
and their IMMEDIATE FAMILIES. Alumni do not qualify.
he bowed out complaining of a 
sudden case of the flu and the rest 
of the team took it in the ear.
It has been a season of ups and 
downs for C-MUs mermen. They 
were outclassed by Morris Har
vey, 62-47, in their first meet Dec.
2, but they recovered to conquer 
Lock Haven by a similar score 
three days later. On Dec. 9, C-MU 
lost a close meet to a small but 
potent California squad, but 
bounced back to last Westmins
ter in the first meet of the second 
semester on Jan. 16. Washing
ton and Jefferson proved too 
tough as they prevailed over the 
Tartans in the next meet, 66-47. 
The Athletic Department is mak
ing efforts to eliminate Clarion 
and Indiana from the schedule 
because of their extensive recruit
ing practices, something in which 
C-MU does not participate in 
swimming. Both teams complete
ly outclassed the Tartans, who 
could offer them little real com
petition.
Throughout the season, C-MU 
has had several consistent stand
outs. Bob McIntyre, supported by 
Steve Freeman, has led the team 
in distance freestyle. Dave Climer and Crapster do their best in 
the freestyle sprints, while Kent 
Schnake, backed up by Mike 
Marks, is still bringing down his
STORKS 
SPORTS
times in the 200 yard free. Pro van 
and Mark Ohlson can usually be 
depended upon in diving. The offstrokes are led by LaRochelle in 
the fly, Lowry in the back, and 
Miller and Pete Hoysan in the 
breast. Two of the remaining four 
meets promise to be close con
tests, but, unfortunately, three 
of them are away. However, you 
can still join the swelling crowds 
at the Cleveland State meet here 
Feb. 27 at 2 p.m. The team and 
Coach Fagan would appreciate 
all support.
