Ipeak On Foods
At the last Sigma Xi colloquium 
the present school year, held on 
Tuesday, May 7, in the Faculty 
lounge, Professor Helen S. 
[itchell of the Home Economics 
)epartment spoke on Background 
Dr Interpreting the Food Situa^on iri Europe. Professor Mitchell 
?ported that calories are still the 
lital measure of food in famine 
reas, and that although the need 
>r protein, minerals, and vita[mins become secondary when peo' pie are starving, they must be 
! considered. While race, color, and 
[creed have nothing to do with a 
I minimum food requirement, cus
tom and adaptation do enter into 
the picture. The amazing adjust
ment that the human body is ca
pable of making to reduced food 
intake may account for the fact 
that larger numbers have not died 
)f starvation.
Professor Mitchell, who took 
ler Ph.D. degree in biochemistry 
it Yale University, has done con
siderable experimental work in 
nutrition in addition to teaching, 
|and has been very active in inter
preting advances in the knowledge 
)f nutrition to the public. At the 
beginning of the war she left Mas
sachusetts State College to become 
hief Nutritionist in the national 
lutrition program, and later Chief 
lutritionist with the foreign relief 
program of the United States Gov
ernment. She did some of the 
background study and planning 
/hich have since been used in the

rotests Lodged 
In Buggy Race
Since protests have been 
lodged against the decision of 
the judges, the Sweepstakes 
Committee and Judges will 
meet and decide on a course of 
action.
I should like to censure 
those motorists who blocked 
the race course after an
nouncements were made in 
the TARTAN and the FAC
ULTY BULLETIN and after 
Department of Public Safety 
signs were posted. If the 
Gymnasium Hill stretch had 
not been blocked, the entire 
^controversy would have been 
voided. A police towing 
truck and full compliment of

Frank L. Wright 
Lectures Friday
On Friday, May 17, at 8:30 
oclock, Frank Lloyd Wright, dis
tinguished American architect, 
will give a lecture in the Little 
Theatre. At present his subject is 
not known. All students and mem
bers of the faculty are invited. 
Tickets for Fine Arts students may 
be obtained in the office, for Mar
garet Morrison students from Dr. 
Watson, and Engineering students 
from Dr. Jones.
Mr. Wright, leader of a modern 
school of architecture, which em
phasizes the building as a part 
of the landscape and surroundings, 
pioneered in using space as an im
portant architectural factor. A lo
cal example of one of his de
signs, inspired by the site and 
blending with surroundings, is the 
Edgar Kaufman lodge at Bear 
Run, a house built out of stone 
ledges over a stream and water
fall. i
Frank Lloyd Wrignt is also the 
founder and sponsor of the Ta
liesin Fellowship, a co-operative 
educational group of young archi
tecture students.

S.A.M. Installs 
Tech Chapter
Carnegie Tech now has a new 
society, the S. A. M., as it will 
shortly become familiarly known.
At a smoker last Monday night 
in the Union, the effoi'ts of the 
students of Management Engineer
ing received a very invigorating 
shot-in-the-arm in the form of 
the enthusiasm shown by officers 
of the local and national S. A. M. 
organization.
Both, Mr. Whitte, who is presi
dent of the Pittsburgh chapter, 
and Mr. Elkus, a national director 
of the Society for the Advance
ment of Management, offered the 
resources of the organization to 
the campus movement, and pro
claimed their personal interest in 
seeing that the labors of the 
C. I. T. chapter are successful. 
With such an array of ardent per
sonalities on the bandwagon suc
cess seems assured with the con
tinued co-operation of the stu
dents.
Plans under consideration for 
the campus society are that it be
come a student round-table pur
suing a program that will furnish 
up-to-the-minute data on current 
problems (rfi ifianiigetoeiKyaceOi.-- 
panied by their un-biased solu
tions. A seminar will be held 
once each month that will cover 
some phase of Management. This 
will precede a meeting to be held 
at night a short time thereafter 
during which the students will 
hear this same phase covered by 
a specialist on the subject. Active 
participation by members in both 
such meetings will be encouraged.
An election of officers is to take 
place at the next group meeting 
which will not be held until short
ly after the opening of the next 
semester. Until that time it was 
agreed by those present at the 
smoker that the organization shall 
continue to function under the di
rection of the provisional com
mittee composed of Howie Morri
son, Bob Bangert, and Fred Detzel.
Delts Win, PiKAs Disqualified 
In Final Run of Sweepstakes
The attempt to quell the last of 
Spring Carnival hangovers, the 
buggy race firrl~, on Saturday 
afternoon s' cceeded only in bring
ing anoti.e ter ific headache to 
one driver, five leg-power men, 
and a swarm ol loyal piKA broth
ers. Their cranial disturbances 
were aroused when it was an
nounced that their buggy had been 
disqualified from the race after 
they had seen it speed across the 
finish line 30 yards ahead of the 
winning Delts white beetle, and 
far in front of the Kappa Sigs six
time winner.
The Delts had hopped off to an 
early lead, but in the free wheel
ing stretch through Schenley Park, 
the trim, maroon buggy of the 
PiKAs surged far in front of the 
field and was never headed for 
the rest of the race.
The PiKA rooters who had 
dashed to vantage points on Flag
staff Hill when the buggies started 
the Schenley Park grind let out 
with elated cheers when they saw 
their buggy enjoying the exclu
sive first place position, and there 
was a mild roar when it soloed 
across the finish line. Their joy
Westinghouse To Hold 
Centennial This Week
The George Westinghouse Centennial Forum celebrating 
the 100th anniversary of the I5irth of George Westinghouse 
will be held in Pittsburgh May 16, 17, and 18. This will be one 
of the finest technical sessions ever to be held with more than 
a score of outstanding scientists and engineers in attendance. 
Dr. Robert E. Doherty, president of C. I. T., will preside
at the first symposium on Sci
ence and Civilization, which will 
be held Thursday morning at 10
A. M. in the Syria Mosque. Open
ing the conference, Dr. Archibald 
V. Hill, a leading figure in British 
science and education and Nobel 
Prize winner in physiology and 
A'ledicine, will speak on Scientific 
Ethics. He will be followed by 
Dr. Isaiah Bowman, president of 
John Hopkins University, and 
George W. Merck, president of 
Merck and Company, talking on 
Scientific Power and Biolog
ical Warfare respectively. After 
a luncheon at the Schenley Hotel, 
Dr. L. W. Chubb, director of Re
search Laboratories of the West
inghouse Electric Corporation, 
will deliver an address on Part
ners in Science.
The Thursday afternoon sym
posium, The Future of Atomic 
Energy,, will begin with a dis
course on Explosives by Dr. J. 
Robert Oppenheimer, professor of 
physics at the University of Cali
fornia. This noted physicist not 
only planned, organized, and di
rected the laboratory where the 
atomic bomb was perfected but 
also assembled the first bomb at 
the test-firing site. Dr. Enrico 
Fermi, professor of physics at the 
University of Chicago, will follow, 
speaking on the subject of Pow
er. Dr. Fermi, a voluntary exile 
from Italy, is noted for work on 
bombardment of the atom, having 
won the Nobel Prize in 1938. Talks 
on Biological Energy by Dr. W.

was shortlived, however, as the 
word disqualified spread over 
the sizeable crowd. The PiKAs 
immediately stormed the judges, 
th Delts sat passively on car 
fenders and crossed their fingers, 
and the Kappa Sigs got out pencil 
and paper to try to figure out how 
many pedestrians they had hit.
The judges reported that the 
PiKA buggy had crowded the 
Kappa Sigs on the turn into Schen
ley Park. The Kappa Sig buggy 
was forced to swerve into a hap
less pedestrian. No one was able 
to locate the smitten bystander 
after the race, but the buggy had 
a concave side for testimony. This 
incident lost many valuable sec
onds for the preliminary winner, 
and it was impossible for them to 
close-up the gap left between them 
and the leaders.
A bleak May sky threatened 
anotherpostponement of the 
races, but the rain stayed under 
control during the afternoon so 
the event went on as scheduled. 
At 2 oclock, Frew Street looked 
more active than the Cut at 8:30 
with Tech students swarming over

A.I.E.E. Banquet 
Saturday Night 
Honors Seniors
The first senior EE banquet since 
the start of the war was held
last gaifrda'f"night:'May 11, al 
the Penn Lincoln Hotel in Wilkinsburg. Held in honor of the gradu
ating seniors, the banquet was 
sponsored by the student branch 
of the A. I. E. E. at Carnegie Tech 
The guest speaker of the evening 
was Mr. E. C. Stone, vice presi
dent of the Duquesne Light Com
pany. Different members of the 
faculty of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department were called on to 
speak, and practically all of the 
faculty were present.
The spirit with which everything 
was done and the large number of 
men who turned out for the af
fair seemed to give all those pres
ent the good old Tech, Carnegie 
Tech feeling. Everything was' 
done in a humorous vein through
out the evening. Doorprizes were 
abundant, and for the seniors, 
special diplomas giving them the 
right to do such things as heckle 
the faculty were supplied. Care
fully packed bundles containing 
super-polished apples (Johnson 
wax, no less) were the faculty 
members loot.
Professor Dennison and Dr. 
Work reminisced about the early 
days of Carnegie Tech and the 
early days of the department. The 
A. I. E. E. organization was high
ly praised by different members of 
the faculty, and its future, it was 
prophesied, would be a bright one 
indeed. Mr. Trautman, who has 
been the counselor for the 
A. I. E. E., is leaving school this 
summer, and the party acted as a 
send-off for him. Dr. Ver Planck, 
assistant professor of Electrical 
Engineering, is to be the new 
counselor.

Strike Delays 
1946 Thistles
Due to conditions beyond our 
controlnamely, the coal strike 
and power shortage which are 
are holding up our covers, and 
the express tie-up which has left 
our lonely Thistles sitting up at 
Falls Creekwe regret to inform 
you that the 1946 Thistle will be 
a little late. We hope to have it 
here during or right after finals.
If the students who dont live in 
Pittsburgh and wont be in school 
this summers will send their names 
and addresses to the Thistle by in
traschool mail, the staff will mail 
their books to them.
P. S. We still think its worth 
waiting for (as no doubt youve 
heard before).

Editors Armchair
A Backward Glance
We are drawing near the end of another school year at 
which time a backward glance of appraisal can often produce 
constructive thought for the future. What have we done right 
and what have we done wrong and why? The answers to these 
questions may be of good use in planning for next year.
In the annals of history, the past months have been ones 
devoted mainly to reconversion, the readjustment to a new 
tempo; nationally and internationally, this period has resulted 
in one of the biggest messes of our times. But there is neither 
time nor space to analyze the past year in a world-wide scope; 
so we will limit ourselves to affairs at Carnegie Tech. 
Reconversion At Carnegie Tech
Reconversion and readjustment here on campus has been 
swifter, less involved, and a great deal more successful than 
that throughout the world. Early in the fall, things were much 
the same as we had left them in the spring (barring the de
parture of the navy) but changes began sprouting before the 
covers on our books had lost their stiffness. The Scottie, a war
time casualty, reopened its offices and began turning out its 
rib-tickling pages once more. One by one inactive fraternities 
gained an active nucleus; one by one frat houses, only recently 
evacuated by army and navy, showed new signs of occupancy. 
Veterans were replenishing the depleted male ranks; and the 
ruptured duck seemed prolific.
Student Council Stag Dances
Simultaneous with these innovations arrived the stream
lined social calendar or the dance-every-weekend-and-wherecan-i-squeeze-in-another arrangement. Student Council, show
ing signs of life, instigated post basketball game stag dances. 
These affairs proved to be neither successes or failures but 
good tries at a good idea. Most everybody favored them; a lot 
of people went to them. Usually they began with a good crowd 
which milled around for a while and eventually drifted out 
leaving a spacious and airy dance floor to three or four en
during couples. A reason for this mass exodus might have been 
that the unattached men huddled in one group and the unat
tached women in another, each eyeing the other from a safe 
distance but seldom mingling. Also the selection of canned 
music was not up-to date, varied, or particularly suitable for 
dancing. In general the dances were too impromptu and com
pletely lacking in any signs or organization or sponsorship. Yet 
in spite of these shortcomings, it has been accepted as a splen
did idea. Perhaps with better music, some definite planning, 
and a few organized efforts at getting people together, these 
casual little shindigs will gain a man-sized place in campus 
social life and offer an opportunity for informally meeting 
ones fellow students.
By the time the registration line had formed for second 
semester, Carnegie Tech was looking more like its old self 
and students were prophesying the imminent return of those 
oft-mentioned good ol days. The enrollment figures revealed 
the trenda near normal quota and a high percentage of men. 
Along with the enrollment rise appeared new professors, 
course revisions, 8:30 classes, and Saturday morning labs. 
Beaux Arts Ball
Soon there were murmurings in the Arts School which 
had also caught the spirit of the times. A reactivated Beaux 
Arts Honorary was planning a Beaux Arts Ball, the first in 
eight years. Unfortunately the enthusiasm did not catch too 
well and a few individuals carried the weight of the prepara
tions. Ticket sales lagged; decorations went slowly; many stu
dents were reluctant, hesitant, and even suspicious. But some
how a final burst of enthusiasm saw the ball through to what 
most students called a successful dance. For those who were 
familiar with the glorious tradition of the Beaux Arts Ball, 
the 1946 version turned out to be more an ordinary masquer
ade than the super-colossal exciting three ring circi ie
past. Perhaps the blame for these limitations shoul n
those aforementioned doubting Thomases w licontinued on
Yochum Receives 
Display Award
On Tuesday, May 7, the grand 
prize in the William D. Gardner 
Memorial Contest for the best de
sign for a lobby display sub
mitted by upperclass P & Ds was 
awarded to Donald Yochum, a 
junior industrial designer. Mr. 
Yochum also won first prize in 
the class gijoup. Other prize
winners were: first prize for senior 
industrial designers, Delmar Damrau; first prize for senior pictorial 
designers, Jean Rush; first prize 
for junior pictorial designers, 
Martha Morrill; second prize, Joan 
Siegfried; third prize, Robert 
Smith.
The presentation ceremony, 
which took place in the lecture 
room of the P. & D. Department, 
opened with a few words from 
Professor Roy Hilton, who intro
duced Mr. Paul McGehen of Gard
ner Displays. Mr. McGehen 
thanked the students for their co
operation in the contest and con
gratulated all the participants. 
Mrs. William Gardner then an
nounced the winners and present
ed the prizes.
This contest was sponsored by 
Gardner Displays in conjunction 
with the P. & D. Department to 
promote interest in display work 
and develop students for possible 
jobs in this field. The problem was 
a display for a lobby of a large 
office building. There was a great 
deal of freedom in the type of 
product displayed, including ev
erything from glass and plastics 
to airplane motors and railroads.
Physics Dept* 
OrganizesNewClan
The undergraduate students in 
the Department of Physics have 
just organized a new club called 
the Proteus Clan. The purpose of 
this club is to promote a feeling 
of unity among the students and 
professors of the department by 
better acquainting them with 
each other.
The first meeting,, of the new 
club, a banquet, will be held 
this Friday evening, May 17, 
at 6:30 in the Carnegie Union. 
A constitution defining the pur
poses of the organization will 
be presented and officers for 
the following year will be 
elected at this meeting. Two 
speakers and a planned program 
will complete the evenings enter
tainment. All members are urged 
to be present.
Critical Temperature
In spite of its being May, and 
Spring, and leaves and grass and 
flowers coming out all over the 
place and making everybody, even 
a drama reviewer, feel happy and 
well-disposed towards every one, 
even actors, we had had  secret 
longing to fill this column with a 
choice selection of caustic com
ments about the last show of the 
season, since this is as it were our 
swan-song, at least as far as the 
Tartan is concerned. Yes, we too 
are about to shake the dust of 
Carnegie from our feet and fare 
forth into the worldand just now, 
when going to school has again be
come fun, after the long, dull years 
of war! So with this articles we not 
only tell what we thought of the 
last show, but bid farewell to the 
Drama Department, and thank it 
for the many enjoyable evenings it 
has given us in the Little Theater 
throughout our school career. 
There have been times when the 
evenings were long and the seats 
hard, but looking back on it from 
here, the number of good shows 
far outweighs that of the bad ones 
and it is the memory of the good 
ones that we will take with us 
when we leave the campus.
We have much to thank the Dra
ma Department for, for the theater 
has long been our first love. We 
cannot help being disappointed 
that it has foiled our intention to 
fill this column with unkind re
marks. For in all honesty we can 
think of few unkind remarks to 
make about the double-feature 
currently playing at the Little 
Theater. We thoroughly enjoyed 
the entire presentation, and those 
who saw us afterwards at the 
drugstore radiating over our coffee 
can testify that we were so pleas
edthat we said hello to every
body whether we knew them or 
not!
The two plays are very different, 
so we make no attempt to discuss 
them together or compare them. 
Trial by Jury is a show that al
most everyone will like, and if 
you dont like it there must be 
something wrong with you. While 
it is not one of the most famous 
Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, it 
is a typical one, and so short that 
you have no time to get tired of 
it before the end. Like the others, 
it is a strong but good-natured 
satire on British customs, with its 
particular target the rigamarole 
connected with the dispensing of 
justice in England.
News from Here and There
The doubters and cynics on 
campus who are dubious about 
the Tartans importance in the 
journalistic world and in the 
scheme of things in general should 
take a look at the editors desk 
some time and examine the flood 
of mail which flows across it. In 
these days of scientific promotion 
and advertising programs, the 
significance of even the smallest 
papers and magazines has been 
realized and so the boosters of 
everything from the Republican 
Party to Carters Little Liver 
Pills send their various brochures 
to all sources which might possi
bly use any of the information 
supplied. As a result of this Sen
sible policy, the Tartan staff, and 
through us, you too can get the 
latest poop from group.
The first envelope opened today 
yielded the amazing fact that one 
can now purchase a lightweight, 
all-welded hand delivery truck for 
prices ranging from $9.10 to 
$14.95, which is guaranteed use
ful for virtually everything and 
which can be delivered immedi
ately. Just what this newspaper 
would do with a hand delivery 
truck is a good question. Strong 
backs and light minds deliver the 
copies of this splendid publication 
to the appointed places. Of course 
these handy gadgets might be 
used to bring into the editorial 
room the hundredweights of copy 
with which our eager reporters in
sist on deluging us every week, 
but somehow or other, the endow
ment fund cant quite be stretched 
for an extra $9.10.
The next item is disposed of in
a hurry, for its the Knickerbocker 
Weekly, a propaganda organ about 
Holland and the Netherland East 
Indies, published by the Dutch 
government. Printed on slick pa
per, well written, and expensive
ly illustrated, it makes fine read
ing and the temptation is great 
after reading it, to send a letter to 
Congress demanding the immedi
ate increase of aid to Holland, but 
we have become weary of official 
government publications and have 
reason to suspect that the contents
Glee Club Awards 
Keys To Members
The Womens Glee Club of 
C. I. T. held its annual banquet in 
the President Room of the Roose
velt Hotel Tuesday, May 7, at 6:30 
P. M. At the conclusion of the 
dinner,/ the girls provided their 
own entertainment by singing oldtime favorites and presenting 3 
humorous skit and reading. Imogene Grove, the secretary-treasurer, then awarded activities keys 
to the girls who had participated 
in Glee Club for two or more 
years. Ondeine Rau received a 
gold-jeweled key because of her 
position as business manager thiii 
past year.
The following hew officers were 
announced: Anita Mortimer, bus
iness manager; Imogene Grove, as
sistant business manager; Peggy 
Gautsch, secretary-treasurer; Dor
othy Petroni and Alyce Beachler, 
librarians. A sljort speech by Mrs. 
Kurtz, the director, ended the 
banquet.
The production is full of good 
spirits, good singing, good acting, 
and all the other things that make 
operettas fun. A1 Checcos comic 
gift makes him a natural for the 
role of the Judge, and he romps 
off with the show. His clowning is 
expert, and all the time he keeps 
just this side of overplaying  
which is the best place to be. Wilford Thunhurst was even more 
appealing than usual as the hap
less defendant whose only crime is 
that he loves this young lady to
day, and loves that young lady to
morrow. Lois Slessinger was 
charming and lovely as the 
plaintiff, who had made the 
mistake of buying her trousseau 
too soon. Her singing left some
thing to be desired, but perfect 
voices are not a requirement for 
Gilbert and Sullivan, for the fam
ous pair themselves preferred 
singers who could act to those 
with more perfect voices. While we 
are on the subject, we want to add 
that Mr. Thunhursts singing 
seemed to us the most pleasant 
and accomplished. Robert Parks 
was very amusing as the usher, 
whose instructions to the jury are 
reminiscent of the recent newspa
per scandal. The rest of the cast, 
bridesmaids, attorneys, jurymen, 
and public, as well as soloists, all 
played up to the standard of excel
lence set by the principals. And 
we must not forget the fine piano 
playing by Joseph Dove and Alfred 
Kuhn of the Music Department.
While Trial by Jury has univer

is for a more restricted audience, 
You may like it very much, or U

parts of it. We belong to the lJ*tnamed group. Some aspects of this 
fantasy are just what Tiggers like, 
and others are a trifle boring. Gen
erally speaking, we were much 
more impressed by the first act, 
which shows the sins by them
selves and also as embodied in 
human beings. The second act was 
a little too obvious for our taste; 
we quickly understood that when 
Elsie adopted the Seven Deadly 
Sins she displayed them all her
self, leaving none for the rest of 
the world, and the authors reit

IT Metals Club 
ponsors Picnic 
t South Park
The Carnegie Tech Metals Club 
back. And to prove it, the 
Boys had a big doins out at 
outh Park last Friday. Before 
e war, the club was the pride 
nd joy of the Tavern owners beause they always had a lot of 
usiness when the Club had stag 
arties, and, from the looks of 
hings, the group is well-started 
n the road to recovery after being 
espielt during the war.
Fridays picnic featured a unergrad-grad plus faculty softball 
arae, played under the handicap 
f 2-foot grass. The elders waloped the undergrads for ten runs 
n the first five innings and held 
10-2 advantage, when the cover 
ell off the ball. Engineers being 
hat they are, a new one was 
found and the game continued. 
While the youngsters were busy 
combing the pitching of Dr. Hawks 
and Ben Alexander, the faculty 
was held to a single hit in the suc
ceeding five innings (they were 
having so much fun, they didnt 
want to quit after nine,) by a 
new undergrad pitcher. The lat
ter started a parade across home 
plate and eventually, the faculty 
threw in the towel. The faculty 
still had their 10 (they cant take 
that away), but the Stoods now 
had amassed 14.
After the ball game, food was in 
order and everyone ate heartily.
Next on the docket were songs 
as theyve never been killed be
fore. Fred Harlan did himself 
proud by producing something 
which resembles music from the 
battered piano present, and the 
affair wound up with an im
promptu, all-male Virginia Reel.

be decided upon by the staff. As 
far as is now known, it will be a 
magazine that will be of value to 
the students and the alumni. Its 
main theme will include new di
rections in music, art, drama, sculp
ture, architecture, and interior 
decorating. It will also feature ar
ticles written oy leading person
alities in the different fields. It 
will be an opportunity for the stu
dents in the Fine Arts School to 
have their work published, such 
as short stories, architectural de
sign, art work, and plays. The 
magazine will also be a means by 
which the under-classmen in Fine 
Arts and the students in the other 
schools on campus can find out 
what goes on in the different Fine 
Arts courses such as programs and 
inter-departmental activities.
Mr. Robert Lepper, Fine Arts 
instructor, presented the Senior 
illustrators with a problem relat
ing to the Beaux Arts Magazine. 
The theme of the problem was to 
show the direction in which thi 
magazine might go. The results are 
nov/ on display in the first and 
third floor exhibition rooms in 
the Fine Arts Building.
The magazine is a project of the 
recently reorganized Beaux Arts 
Honorary Society. This honorary 
also sponsors the Beaux Arts Ball 
and encourages participation of 
Fine Arts students in school activ
ities.
UNNRA Needs 
Seagoing Cowboys
Sea-going cowboys to take live
stock to Europe on UNRRA ships 
are needed during the vacation 
period. One man will have charge 
of thirty mares or hiefers and his 
uties will include feeding, waterng, and cleaning. This is an oportunity for a free trip to Europe 
lus $150.00 in cash and an opporunity to help relieve the food 
hortage in Europe,
All applications should be diected to Mr. Benjamin G.

om their draft board.
Oh those buggy races! Never 
again! Not that there is anything 
wrong with them, but they can 
get people involved in the 
darndest sort of troubles. It all 
happened this away.
I was walking out of the Bean
ery on Saturday afternoon, when I 
checked my watch and noticed 
that it was two oclock, time for 
the Sweepstakes Finals. So I hied 
myself over to Maggie Murph 
Street in order to take a brief look 
before returning to the publica
tions office to do some honest 
work. The buggies were all lined 
up, looking sleek and colorful. 
The three drivers were nonchalant, 
puffing on cigarettes and finger
nails, the pushers were bouncing 
up and down behind them, await
ing the starting gun. Everyone 
was wearing neat gym or service 
clothes and all looked properly 
slicked up for a Sunday picnic. 
It promised to be an urbane af
fair. A young lady in gray stood 
by the starting line, waving a blue 
flag and looking important. When 
I asked a passerby about her, he 
replied:
Why thats Ann Stansbury, the 
campus queen!
I started to think about the sub
ject but never got past the first 
thought. Just then someone pass
ed by, carrying a camera and
Navy Opens V-5 
For Enlistments
The Navy is now accepting ap
plications for enlistment as Avi
ation Cadets from all men who 
have completed their sophomore 
year in college or who are now 
enrolled in their second semester 
of the sophomore year. Orders to 
active duty can be expected within 
two weeks after enlistment or 
upon completion of the sophomore 
year in college, whichever is later.
The program consists of three 
years of active duty and two years 
of school work to complete the col
lege program. The naval aviation 
plan should be of interest to stu
dents of draft age, since it will 
insure their completion of the first 
two years of college and their final 
return for completion of the col
lege course.
Council Elects Officers
At a regular meeting of Student 
Council, Wednesday, May 1, Jim 
Garner was elected president and 
Joe Nutter, vice-president, for the 
coming year. These elections are 
the result of the combined efforts 
of both the old and new Council 
members.
looking distraught as photograph
ers will at times like this. I gave 
another look and sure enough, it 
was my old buddy from Joisey.
This photographer was strictly 
from the old school. None of this 
business of getting real action 
pictures for him; everything 
would have to be properly posed. 
He chased the pushmobiles and 
their Weary pushers a dozen yards 
behind the finish line and ordered 
them to move forward. This they 
did, but they werent eager. Then 
he moved them back again in or
der to get another angle on the 
situation. The drivers were still 
looking good, despite their cramp
ed positions, but the pushers were 
getting ready to give up and pass 
out. My free-lance friend was 
finally satisfied with the action 
end of the race, but pictures must 
be sold and pictures which sell 
must include girls. And thats 
where the fun started.
The driver of the Delt buggy, 
which was finally declared the 
winner, was a sleek young man, 
calm and confident as he sat in 
his cockpit and accepted the 
plaudits of the crowd in a digni
fied way. But the photographer 
wasnt satisfied,
Now kiss the winner, Ann. 
After all, the victor of such a race 
deserves a reward and so do my 
efforts. Please! Aw, pretty please!
As he let out with this pro
nouncement, poor Ann started to 
blush, and shortly turned a furi
ous red as the crowd closed in and 
proceeded to enjoy the fun.
But Ive never been formally 
introduced and besides, wouldnt 
a hug do?
She looked very shy and her 
voice was properly plaintive, but 
the photoman had a hard heart, 
and kept pressing the point. Just 
then, the police came along and 
demanded that the street be clear
ed. So, the buggy was moved into 
a parking place and the rountine 
started all over again. Ann put 
her arm around the Delt driver 
while the argument raged, and 
soon became well acquainted, it 
seemed as though she knew the 
boys sister. When they finally 
embraced, things were percolating 
and my opinion of the men of Del
ta Tau Delta went up another 
notch. Everyone left happy as they 
broke it up, while I handed the 
case to my ex-friend, Ann Stans
bury raincoat back to Ann, and 
myself a good kick in the rear for 
getting caught in the whole mess.
The boys at the publication of

ELEANOR SQUITERI
Eleanor Squiteri, "5quit to all 
her friends, is an attractive greeneyed Tri Delt who has the past 
records of four sisters and a broth
er to uphold here at C. I. T. One 
of our own Pittsburgh girls and 
an old settler in the Squirrel Hill 
District, she is a graduate of Tay
lor Alderdice High School.
Eleanor, one of the few girls in 
the College of Engineering and 
Science, is majoring in chemistry 
and is now a first semester sen
ior. Eleanor has more than held 
her own with the boys, for she 
has maintained a 2.5 factor for the 
past four years. Being alone 
among so many men has been an 
education in itself, for Squit 
started here with the A. S. T. P. 
boys during the war and is finish
ing with returning veterans.
Activities play a big part in her 
campus life. Full of sorority spir
it, she has been the Tri Delts 
rushing chairman this year and 
also publicity manager for the 
Carnival Queen Campaign in
Critical Temp[continued from page 2^ 
natural and the natural are kept 
separate, much more effective. 
When Faith, Hope, and Charity, 
to say nothing of Beelzebub, be
come household servants, the cred
ulousness of the audience is 
stretched to the breaking point. 
So much for the play; the produc
tion is another matter.
The Sunlight Sonata is one of 
those shows where production is 
far more important than the play. 
It is something that has to be 
seen, not read, to be properly ap
preciated. To take the most ob
vious example, in the first act 
the most important personage is 
the technical director (Professor 
George B. Kimberly). His lighting 
and sound effects were just won
derful. So also were the costumes 
and make-up of the Seven Deadly 
Sins. It sounds strange to mention 
these things before the acting, 
but since all the supernatural part 
of the play is created for the eye 
rather than the ear, it is proper 
to do so. And before going on we 
bow respectfully to the director, 
Professor Henry Boettcher.
Ray Boyle was a marveious 
Scotch devil. We would have liked 
it if he had Spoken less Scotch 
and more English, but his burr 
was so beautiful that we enjoyed 
listening to it, even though we 
couldnt understand most of it. 
The Sins were all good, but it was 
really their presence, more than 
their acting, that was important. 
The three Virtues left us rather 
cold, more so than the author in
tended. And we still dont care for 
Miss Dunkelmans lisp. The best 
acting in the play was by Mary 
Gibson and Mary Elizabeth Kane, 
as the two women who personify 
gluttony and envy respectively. 
Both gave inspired performances, 
so natural that we cannot get over 
the feeling that we saw the ladies 
on the streetcar last week, yet so 
carefully executed that they never 
once became tiresome or incredi
ble. We were glad to see that Carl 
Betz is a better actor than a juvenwhich so many of the aerial leaf
lets hit the wrong side of Forbes 
Street. In past years she has done 
work for the Technical, and proof 
that she is an all-around girl is 
the sweater with numerals that 
she will receive from the W. A. A. 
for archery.
Last September after winning a 
Civics Problem Essay Contest giv
en in Pittsburgh, she was awarded 
a trip to New York to attend the 
Herald Tribune Convention where 
she acted as Techs representative.
With all her extra-curricular 
activities she still finds time for 
golf and rifle shooting. Though 
she likes best to be outdoors, she 
does enjoy dancing. Strictly a sci
entist, she surprises everyone with 
her flare for cooking, sewing, and 
puttering around the house.
Eleanor has two definite dis
tastes in lifeone is politics, es
pecially campus politics, and the 
other is conceited men. Her ideal 
man must be an intelligent, sin
cere person who is a lot of fun and 
has a good sense of humor.
This August when she receives 
her hard-earned B. S., she hopes 
to enter research work. Last sum
mer she gained valuable experi
ence in rubber research here at 
Tech and would like to do gradu
ate work if she gets the chance.
There is sure to be a successful 
career ahead for Eleanor, for as 
one of her sorority sisters put it, 
Squit is an intelligent gal with a 
terrific personality combined with 
a very understanding nature.

Slush Fund. A few snappy ar
ticles document this and other aocustations. But this example of 
modern literature did not come 
unadorned. It bore heavy black 
grease pencil marks, underlining 
a headline which announced that 
the veterans and the schools are 
losing priority on valuable sur
plus goods to manufacturers 
agents who receive a ten per
cent commission on their sales. 
The dealer-minded War Assets 
Administration is ignoring the 
veterans priority certificates com
pletely jn defiance of an act of 
Congress. The point is well made 
by the Republican News writer, 
but one can readily detect the 
faint odor of frying flesh, as the 
Truman administration is raked 
over the coals by one who is not 
so much interested in the vet
eran as in the heating process. 
The remainder of this journalistic 
travesty takes adequate care of 
all other sections and ramifica
tions of Administration policy and 
leaves the reader without any 
doubts as to which is the best 
American political party.
Certain envelopes can be guar
anteed to appear every week in

pie are put at a mere $2,000,000, 
a quarter of which is expected to 
come from American colleges and 
universities. Only a small part of 
our goal has been met so far. This 
type of cause, in which so little 
can reap such a tremendous har
vest of good will, might best be 
taken care of by a federal appro
priation. Off hand we cant think 
of a worthier cause outside of 
subsidies for pig farmers or the 
silver mines.
The last two bits of mail which 
we opened before the editors 
reached the office are straight ad
vertising. One is an attractive 
booklet sent here by the Pitts
burgh Playhouse which announces 
their coming play, the Front Page. 
It isnt a bad ad as these things 
go and it might be worth seeing 
if the last of the finals are over 
by the 25th. The other piece of 
literature should dispel any illu
sions which Techites may have 
about their alma maters reputa
tion in the business world. It 
opens as follows:
Hello, Journalist:

thumpers here in the Selznick

Duel in the Sun, that is. Picture 
cost 5 and a half million tomatoes 
to make. Add another million for 
prerelease promotion and still an
other for promotion thereafter and 
you come up with a very fat cab
bage. But even a big rival here 
in Hollywood has estimated pub
licly that with solid promotion, 
Duel will gross an easy 30 million 
potatoes. And for one m'otion pic
ture, that, son, is a large bucket 
of clams.
The origin of this reprint is 
probably as old as the American 
college newspaper, so well omit 
the credit line and just reprint it 
without comment.
We have finally found a reason 
to like Texas. The Daily Texan of 
the U. of T., a snappy little paper, 
is a lush source for exchange

 TECH SPORTS 
TECH SPORTING SCENEThinclads Beat
By Dick Heckman
Here we are at the end of anlother sports season,a season, 
Iwhile not sensational, had its share 
[of laughs, thrills and other odds 
and ends which made it as good a 
[season as could be asked under the 
conditions of uncertainty and post
war building. Lets take a look at 
this season from the angle which 
doesnt appear in the papers, but 
f which nevertheless makes sports 
| of tremendous value to anyone 
:onnected with them.
It all started way back in Octojer, when Tech came out of its 
Iwar-time hibernation. The first 
I varsity call to go out was for the 
jsoccer team. Pat OConnor, the 
[first day, got a look at one of the 
wierdest assortments of maniacs 
| he has ever had the misfortune to 
behold, But they could play soc
cer! Featuring four Turks, some 
Chinese, a couple of South Ameri
cans and some North Americans, 
the team rolled to the most suc
cessful season ever enjoyed by a 
Tech soccer aggregation. All in 
all, they won four and lost but 
one. During the course of several 
trips, the squad was treated to 
several oddities, including the 
singing of Turkish songs by the 
members present from the country, 
the bus driver, mistaking the Thiel 
College soccer field for a parking 
lot and trying to park his bus in 
it, and the theme song of the or
ganization, Chloe.
In a short time, basketball took 
over, and though the boys found 
things a bit rough when it came 
to winning ball games, a good time 
was had by all. Max Hannum 
and Ed Milcovich, of Duquesne 
fame, tutored the squad for the 
first part of the season, and the 
green team showed a lot of prog
ress in the early stages. The best 
game of the first of the season 
was turned in against Penn State, 
where the Skibos, miniature be
side the giants of State, fought all 
the way and really threw a scare 
into the State clan before suc
cumbing by seven points. The 
first win of the season was regis
tered at Allegheny, when on Maxs 
birthday, his son Gene dumped in 
20 points as a present and Tech 
came out with a one-point margin.
These weeks also found the 
group fascinated on the trips by 
the warbling of foreign songs. C. 
T. Butler, from the far off land 
of Kentucky had the boys in 
stitches with his renditions of 
That Good Ole Mountain Dew 
and several other ditties from the 
Martin-Coy country. Paul Kuzma, 
who came to be known as Amzuk, chipped in Russian songs to 
add to the turmoil, and Lew Heiles 
put in with the New Kensington 
Love Call (or something like 
that).
Well, the Fearless Five, un
daunted by a healthy losing streak, 
went down to see how the West 
Virginia Mountaineers were makBOWLING

ing out. For a full half, the Skibos 
refused to see that West Virginia 
had a better ball club and went to 
the dressing room at half-time, 
trailing by a mere three points. 
That was all, though. The Mounties let loose the second half and 
scored almost at will as our heroes 
staggered around the floor with 
their tongues hanging out.
When the team returned with a 
win from the trip to Cleveland and 
Case, everyone who congratulated 
them was met with a picture of 
the team with women clustered all 
around them. Kuzma even came 
p with a letter from one of the 
girls which professed her undy
ing adoration.
With the coming of winter, 
swimming took the spotlight. 
Coach Risedorphs cew had a 
rough time amongst the waves 
and, try like mad, they couldnt 
win. The team, which took on 
more experienced opposition than 
<they could handle, lost to the 
Oberlin collection of V-12s and 
Case, both twice.
All of which brings us to the 
present time of year which has the 
golf team, tennis and track teams 
in action. The golfers have been 
taking things on the chin pretty 
much, but the other two have been 
doing all reet, both winning three 
and losing only to Pitt.
What about coming events?

Geneva Again Netsters Trim Future
Profs; Pitt Here Wed.
In a near-duplicate of that of 
last week, the Tartan track team 
poured on the power to whip the 
Geneva College representatives for 
the second time in eight days. The 
score of the latter meet, at Ge
neva showed Tech 80 y2, Geneva 
459,2. The meet much resembled 
the previous weeks meet in score, 
weather and various and sundry 
other matters. The only change in 
the win column for Tech came in 
the broad jump where Riehl an
swered a long-standing question. 
One-Shoe has come home with 
the bacon in the high jump every 
time this year and people have 
been asking themselves why he 
didnt use his springiness in the 
broad jump. He did just that Sat
urday and uncorked a leap of 
19-41/^ to win the event.
Sherwood Sets Record?
Captain Jack Sherwood dupli
cated last weeks performance in 
the high hurdles to get Tech 
off to a good start. Jack covered 
the distance in : 11.9 seconds which 
is quite startling for the 120 yard 
eventin fact it would be a 
worlds record. The catch is that 
the track was so muddy in the 
vicinity of the start of the race 
that the boys started up the road 
farther and didnt cover 120 yards. 
Reamer Unhindered By Mud 
Bill Beamer turned in the fast
est performance of the day. The 
rain and mud slowed up every
body but Rapid William. He left 
the pack far in his wake to take 
the mile run in 4.39, just .7 sec
onds slower than last week.
The Three Ks 
Geneva bad only one man enter
ed in the 440 and the three Tartans 
present had no trouble in dispos
ing of him. Bob Kindi splashed his 
way home in front of Kruper and 
Stan Kohn to win the event and 
add nine more points to Techs 
mounting total.
Ware Gets Three Firsts
Warren Ware was the big gun 
for Tech as far as point-getting is 
concerned. He took first place in 
the discus, pole-vault and shotput to rack up 15 big points for the 
Skibos. Merrill Andrews, who 
practically was a one-man team 
here Iasi week when he garnered 
24 points all by his lonesome, was 
held to 141/2 on Saturday, still not 
a bad total. Summary:

The weather man has been do-' 
ing his best to cheat the current 
edition of the Carnegie tennis 
team out of its allotted share of 
matches this past week. On Mon
day, the team was scheduled to 
exercise its collective muscles 
against Thiel College, but Ole Man 
Mose dumped buckets of rain all 
over the place and the boys had to 
sit that one out. Again on Wed
nesday, with California State 
Teachers College on the schedule, 
rain got in the way, but the match 
was rescheduled and was played 
Thursday at the Westinghouse 
courts. The Skibos vanquished 
the Teachers by a score of 8-1 for 
its third win against one loss in 
intercollegiate competition this 
year.
Gale Sweeps Courts
One could hardly call Thurs
days affair a tennis match as the 
wind swept across the courts at a 
60mph clip and made tennis in the 
true sense of the word impossible. 
However, those who could stand 
up against the gale did hit the ball 
back and forth and came up with 
something in the way of scores. 
Meyers Starts Onslaught
Jack Meyers of Tech caught 
Keller of the visitors off his guard 
and whipped him 6-0 in the first 
set. Keller finally caught on to 
the fact that there was a wind 
blowing and put up a belated rally 
in the second, but Meyers was not 
to be denied and took it, 8-6. 
Bolog of the visitors came through 
with his teams only marker when 
he nosed out Joe Harmuth in three 
sets, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Joe couldnt 
find himself in the wind and con
tinually hit his volleys out of 
court. A1 Sellke finally rolled his 
glorified jalopy up the hill to the 
courts and he and Dick Heckman 
got out long enough to whip two 
more Als, Nivert and Kramer of
the visitors by 6-4, 6-3 and 6-4, 
6-0 respectively. Previously, Dick 
DiPrima had whipped Lee Schaf
fer handily and Bob Scoenberger 
and Nochta had started what was 
to become a marathon. After all 
the other singles had long since 
been completed, these two were 
battling out long points and many 
deuce games. Things got a little 
touchy as both boys, anxious for a 
victory, started to doubt each 
others word on close shots and 
the situation became a little 
strained. However, both soon 
were put at ease as Schoenberger 
took the final set to win the match, 
6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
Tech Sweeps Doubles
The only thing which resembled 
doubles saw the Harmuth-Meyers 
combo trim Nivert and Kramer in 
a close one, 9-7, 6-4. The other 
two doubles matches were 
largely a case of who could judge 
the wind the best. Tech came out 
on the long end of both as Sellke 
and Heckman won and DiPrima 
and Tony Arrott had enough left 
after being surprised in the second 
set to win, 6-0, 8-6.
Allegheny was to be the guest 
last Saturday but again rain inter
vened and put an end to the mat
ter before it could get started.
Pitt...........Slippery Rock Sat.
The team plays Geneva away 
Monday and plays host to the Pitt 
Panthers here Wednesday. The 
boys will be out to avenge the 
shellacking they took at the hands 
of Pitt earlier in the season, 
their only defeat to date. Word 
has it that the Tech courts may 
even be ready by then, in which 
event the team will get a chance to 
play on its home grounds for the 
first time this year. Summary:

Golfers Drop Three; 
Westminster, W. Va. Win
The ill-fated Tartan golf team 
took it on the chin three times this 
week and are, sad to say, still 
looking for their first victory of 
the current season.
Christenson Burns Up Worse
On Monday, May 6 the boys en
tertained Westminster and, from 
the looks of things, had a wee bit 
of an overdose of Spring Carnival 
as they bowed 11-4 to the visitors. 
Highlight of the day was the hot 
round turned in by Arnie Chris
tenson for the Skibos. Arnie 
socked his way around the Field 
Club course and came home with 
a blistering 75 to take medal hon
ors and capture three of the four 
Tech points. Even with the dis
advantage of two penalty strokes, 
he put together a 38 and a 37 over 
the tough layout. Norm Zuerner 
racked up the other Tech point in 
the number five position as he 
won one of the nines.
On Friday, the team took off for 
Westminster and really gave the 
home team a scare before going 
down by a margin of one point, 
9V2-ay2. Christenson was low 
man again with an 80 on the New
castle Field Club course and 
picked up three points. Wissner,
playing No. 3 for the Skibos came 
up with three more tallies as he 
beat Paine, 3-0. Dankmeyer 
picked up 2% more and the situ
ation began to look pretty good 
for the Techites. However, fate 
just couldnt see a win and the 
Westminster No. 5 and No. 6 men 
came up with six big points be
tween them to take the match.
Saturday saw the Putterers light 
out for the hill country to try to 
avenge a previous lacing at the 
hands of the West Virginia Moun
taineers. Well, the less said about 
the latest massacre the better. 
West Virginia won, 9-0, so well 
give the summary and let it go at 
that.
This week sees the conclusion of 
the season as the team entertain* 
Geneva here Monday and travels 
to meet Grove City Friday.
Summary of the West Virginia 
debacle:
Krak (W. V.) defeated Chris

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MAY 14, 1946
The Passing Parade
By Carl Klahr
It is very easy to be an alarmist nowadays, and perhaps 
it is also necessary, especially where foreign affairs are con
cerned. The events of the past few weeks accentuate the grow
ing fear that we are again treading the road to war. War with 
whom0 About what? No one knows or cares to know.
No European country, apparently, has faith in a continued 
peace. If the United States has this faith it lacks the foresight 
to back it up. The result is that every nation is hedging, trying 
to better its position at the expense of its neighbors in prepara
tion for the coming struggle. Russia in particular is playing a 
backiiand game in protecting all of central Europe, mean
while establishing governments there, friendly to herself, and 
indoctrinating the people with anti-western sentiment. In 
Manchuria too, the Russians are systematically looting Chinese 
productive capital. Britain is conducting her colonial empire 
in the same way, extending imperialism. The United States 
may yet become a partner to international chaos by refusing 
Britain a four billion dollar grubstake to prosperity. On the 
sidelines stand millions of starving people in Europe and Asia, 
with relatively little help reaching them from the outside. 
Starvation breeds wars, especially when the hungry sufferers 
reflect that the United States, Britain, and Russia, by taking 
drastic steps, could relieve their distress. These are all in
stances of national selfishness. Such national selfishness, stem
ming from fear, produces widespread suspicion. We have 
nothing to fear but fear itself; nevertheless fear is gnawing at 
the vitals of any collective effort towards peace. Specifically, 
take the case of the Big Four Foreign Ministers Conference in 
Paris this week. There the United States Secretary of State, 
James Byrnes, proposed a four 
power alliance between the United 
States, Britain, Soviet Russia, and 
France aimed at keeping Germany 
and Japan disarmed for the next 
25 years. Secretary Byrnes theory 
was that Russia wanted to be 
able to count on American help in 
this ticklish job. He proffered the 
limited alliance as a friendly ges
ture. But Russia pounced on this 
offer as an anti-Soviet trick de
signed to build up Germany at 
Russias expense. How powerful 
must be Russian distrust of us, to 
engender such an inexplicable at
titude! This action has done more 
to embarrass friends of Russia in 
the United States than any other 
Russian move since the end of the 
war. Worst of all, it is a great tri
umph for that faction of the State 
Department which insists that 
Russion policy is directed against 
the capitalistic world.
More and more, people are com
ing to think that the globe is di
vided into two separate parts, into 
two worlds instead of one world.
There is little agreement between 
Russia and her satellites on one 
hand, and the U. S.-British com
bine on the other. The smaller na
tions are choosing sides.
If there were fundamental 
cleavage of mankind into two sep
arate species this would be under
standable. There is not. If there 
were not food enough on the 
earth for all its inhabitants, this 
would be understandable. There 
is enough food, land, and raw ma
terials for 20 billion people, not 
merely for two billion. What is 
the answer? Fear and suspicion.
We are afraid of the Russian ogre, 
so we must out-ogre him. Russia 
is pretty good at the ogre game 
too, and so the play continues. It 
would be interesting to watch ex
cept that, in this year of the 
atomic era, the stakes are too 
high. In the game of war there 
are no spectators; everyone par
ticipates.
To allay this background of sus
picion the U. S. must do three 
things. First, we must scrap our 
selfish food policy and impose 
war rationing if necessary to show 
the world that we dont sit back 
while millions starve. Second, stop 
goad! ' Russia as we did in the 
Iranian affair, where despite Rus
sian acceptance of the UN ver
dict to remove its army from Iran,
Secretary Byrnes continued to de
mand humiliating concessions. No 
wonder Russia is suspicious after 
a going-over. Finally, lets not 
emphasize our difference from the 
Russians culturally and econom
ically. Perhaps friendship and 
common sense on our part can jolt 
some sense into the rest of the 
world.

M. M. Senate 
Revives Tradition 
Of Sr. Assembly
Last Tuesday marked the re
vival of another Carnegie Tech 
tradition in Margaret Morrison, 
that of Senior Assembly sponsored 
by Senate. It was held in Mar
garet Morrison Assembly Hall at 
11:30, on Tuesday, May 7.
Following an opening address 
given by Mary Madelyn Gannon, 
newly elected president of Sen
ate, Dr. Watkins, Director of Mar
garet Morrison spoke. At the 
close of the hour, the seniors 
marched out to the tune of the Al
ma Mater, and the juniors took 
the seats which the seniors had 
just vacated, the sophomores occu
pied the juniors chairs, and the 
freshmen, the sophomores.
Prof. Chworowsky To Direct 
Conference of Jews, Christians
Here but six years and leaving 
us already (after this semester) 
Dr. Martin P. Chworowsky, asso
ciate professor of Psychology and 
Education, has become one of the 
favorites of the students. Perhaps 
this is because he takes a personal 
interest in each of his students 
with the result that they respect 
him and cooperate to the best of 
their ability.
Born in San Antonio, Texas, Dr. 
Chworowsky lived there for only a 
year until his family moved to 
Minnesota. As his father was a 
minister, they were constantly 
moving from place to place. After 
completing his high school educa
tion in Milwaukee, he entered 
Harvard University and later 
Harvard Law School. He began 
his teaching at a private boys 
school in the East and then came 
to Pittsburgh to teach, also in a 
private school. With this experi
ence to his credit, he became the 
head of the newly established Falk 
Elementary School at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. While teach
ing. there, he did graduate work in 
his main interest, progressive edu
cation. From there he proceeded 
to Columbia University, Ohio State 
University, and then to Carnegie 
Tech (1940). Here he was made 
a member of Phi Kappa Phi, scho
lastic honorary.
Dr. Chworowsky is married and
has one daughter, still in high 
school. In his spare time he may 
be found listening either to piano 
music or, if he is at his New 
Hampshire home, he will be found 
puttering around in elementary 
carpentrybuilding porches and 
other additions to his rambling 
farmhouse. Oh yes, he also thor
oughly enjoys baseball and foot
ball and would much rather be a 
participant than a spectator.
This summer, however, he will 
not have much leisure time, for he 
has been selected as the Educa
tional Director of the Central Di
vision of the National Conference 
of Jews and Christians and is leav
ing us to teach at the University 
of Denver.
According to Dr. Chworowsky, 
there is nothing more discourag
ing than to meet so many students 
who forget they are no longer in 
high school. They expect their 
teachers to treat them as such 
and, because the teachers rather 
like this attitude, they conform to 
the students desires. As a result, 
neither the teachers nor the stu

other interesting observation of

It was simply amazing to see how 
conflicts between two opposing

America Learns to Make Its Own Camphor
F
or years, the Japanese maintained a tight hold on the worlds camphor supply.
Americans had to have camphor in ever-increasing quantity for the manufacture of photographic film, 
celluloid, plastics, perfumes, medicines, lacquers and disinfectants. But they were forced to pay whatever 
price the Japanese chose to ask. And even at 1919a exorbitant top figure 
of $3.75 a pound, they were never sure of a full supply.
Men of Du Pont undertook to make 
this country independent of such an 
unsatisfactory source. They knew 
that camphor could be synthesized, but to make it at low cost and in 
large quantities was an entirely different matter. Long years of experi
ment and research produced little 
but disappointment. But finally, in 
1932, a way was found to produce low-cost chemical camphor on a com
mercial scale that matched natures 
product in color, texture, scent and usefulness.
NO.2Gt from Turpentine
Basic material from which Du Pont camphor is made is pinene, obtained 
from turpentine from southern 
pine trees. The formula of pinene 
(C10H) seems to differ but little from that of camphor (CioHigO), but 
the structural difference is consider
ably greater than is indicated by the single atom of oxygen. Although the 
chemical conversion of pinene to camphor is not difficult to accomplish in the laboratory, to do so eco
nomically on a commercial scale 
taxed the ingenuity of many Du Pont 
chemists, engineers and designers.
World War II completely shut off 
the supply of natural camphor. But 
within a few months Du Pont production men were able to step up the 
output of the man-made product to 
take care of military, medical and 
civilian needs. Today this supply is going into the manufacture of hun
dreds of products that will bring

more comfort, more satisfaction, 
more joy into the lives of millions.
All the men at Du Pontchem
ists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, and hundreds of others who worked on this developmentfeel 
great pride that they were able to free their country from foreign 
sources for such a vital material in 
our industrial life.
  
SYNTHESIS OPENS NEW ERA 
IN PERFUME MANUFACTURE
Some of the most interesting discov
eries at Du Pont have come from "fundamental research groups as
signed to establish new scientific 
facts without regard to immediate 
commercial use.
Synthetic musk is an example. 
Musk is the most important single 
ingredient used in perfumery, a fixative blending many subtle odors into 
one fragrance and making it lasting. 
Until recently its only source was the 
musk deer of Tibet, an animal near
ing extinction.
Then Du Pont organic chemists, in 
their long-time study of giant mole
cules, noted that a group of ring compounds called macro-ketones re
sembled musk in odor. Following up
their observations with intensive re
search, they produced compounds of 
even more pronounced likeness.
Now, in "Astrotone, perfumers 
are offered a synthetic musk that is of a determined strength, immediately usable and as powerful as the 
pure essence of natural musk.
Questions College Men ask 
about working with Du Pont
"WILL AN ADVANCED DEGREE 
HELP ME AT DU PONT?"
There are many Ph.D.s at Du Pont. 
However, the majority of our chem
ists, chemical and mechanical engi
neers, physicists and biologists are 
Bachelors or Masters. Every effort is 
made to see that full recognition is 
made of a mans scientific training, as 
well as his special experiences and 
aptitudes. For certain openings, a 
higher degree is a distinct asset.

But everyone, including the crit

that making sense out of the daily

answer. The daily press has a ten

back pages whenever a lurid 
murder comes along, especially if 
a sex angle is involved. Their 
sources of news information, the 
great news gathering combines, 
are in themselves defective. 
Whether its being excitable like 
the United Press, or sensational 
like the INS, they arent satisfac

Orchids to S & S
At Spring Carnival this year 
one of the most weil-known of 
Techs many traditions was reviv
ed, that of the production of a 
musical revue, Scotch and Soda. 
In past years, Scotch and Soda has 
been one of the biggest things for 
the weekend of Spring Carnival, 
and this year was certainly no 
exception.
The entire student body owes 
Danny Franks a big vote of thanks 
for his excellent work which he 
did for the production as General 
Manager. This years production 
may not be the longest, but it cer
tainly was one of the best.
Helping Danny in the position 
of Assistant General Chairman 
was Helen Miller who likewise 
did a bang-up job. Along with 
helping Danny in the general or
ganization, Helen was also in sev
eral of the dance acts.
Jane Culp #nd Tom OMalley 
deserve a round of applause for 
the very excellent work which 
they did in the dance routines. For 
weeks before, the plans and the 
rehearsals of the numbers had to 
be very carefully worked out; this 
part of the organization was done 
by these two very capable danc
ers. Not only were the routines 
which they worked out excellent,

Yes Zeke Brill is definitely a good 
looking fellow and girls, he is un
attached. And if you have looks,

good time, you are just what he is 
looking for.
Robert David Brill is what his 
parents back home decided to 
call him but his friends can at
tract his attention with Bob or 
Zeke. Back home is Youngs
town, Ohio, and he came to Tech 
from there because he said it was 
a good engineering school. He en
tered in 1940 but took three years 
off to serve in the army. He was 
the pilot of Hells Belle with the 
Eighth Air Force in England. A 
captain, he survived thirty mis
sions to return to C. I. T. He is 
going to graduate  he hopes  
(shades of Aisenberg) in Sep
tember 1946 as a management en
gineering major and after that he 
wants to do graduate work.
Zeke is President of Henderson 
Hall and Vice President of Dormi
tory Council. He was on the Var
sity Basketball Team during his 
sophomore year and he sure pick
ed' up a lot of splinters. He also 
played intramural basketball and 
football.
His favorite indoor and outdoor 
pastimes are drinking, with craps 
and cards close seconds. When it 
comes to the potent stuff beer is 
his favorite, but at cards he will 
play anything from bridge to 
poker.
Zeke and Dick Heckman had a 
bet as to who would have the 
highest factor last term. Zeke 
didnt study at all for the exam
inations and had only one term 
paper to do. He and Heckman fig
ured that Zeke who won, by the 
way, did four words an hour for 
two weeks to obtain his 3.1; but 
Zeke said that after all he work
ed continually without rest.

And then there were others in 
the organization who should be 
thanked for their part in making 
Scotch and Soda a big success.

worked out by Checco, Motyl, and

Zeke, however, isnt as ornery 
as his car because when it comes 
to food he eats everything. He 
does dislike however Skibo in
tensely. When asked about his 
favorite book, author, band lead
er, singer, or just any favorite 
the only ones he could think of 
were Vaughn Monroe and beer. 
At this point he came up with a 
funny story of a survey course he 
took which entailed a survey of 
Forbes Street and which always 
seemed to detour through the 
Greeks. Beer or Vaughn Monroe?
Zeke is easy going, lazy friend
ly, can take a joke, and is MOD

ever interviewed who said he 
didnt think he ought to be One

GUS KERMES
If any of you happy souls hap
pened to read the April fool edi
tion of the Tartan you probably 
noticed a little ad that offered a 
case of Scotch to anyone who call
ed Ma. 2600 and asked for Gus. 
Those who calledand some naive 
souls didbecame involved in in
telligent conversation with the 
aforementioned Gus before he fin
ally revealed that the most potent 
beverage around was pineapple 
juice. Its not that Gus is a mem
ber of the WDDOFTG (We Dont 
Drink Or Frequent The Greeks) 
but whatever Scotch he has, he 
values.
Back in Crafton they say that 
Gus full name is Constantine 
John Kermes but no one in the in
dustrial design department of 
Fine Arts knows that. Industrial 
design, in case you didnt know, is 
the happy medium between science 
and art. Scientists are too techni
cal when it comes to designing, 
while pure artists are in some 
ways too impractical to be scien
tific, but industrial designers 
combine both subjects in a worka
ble manner. Gus says, for exam
ple, that people would never buy 
a washing machine if they had to 
take the original design. It might 
scare the poor housewife to death. 
But now the industrial designer 
has come to the resue by covering 
it, so that the old machine is both 
good looking and practical.
Not that Gus interests are all in 
school work. For instance, he likes 
to travel. Last summer found him 
a traveler in the Pennsylvania 
Dutch country near Lancaster and 
a boatman on the ol Mississippi 
River. That latter trip almost cost 
him his life. It seems as though 
he fell into the lock of a canal 
near Louisville, Kentucky, and got 
tangled up in some rope. In fact 
he was on his way to the not-sojolly deep when someone noticed 
him floundering in the water and 
eventually fished him out. The
trip into the Pennsylvania Dutch 
country was also exciting, though 
not nearly so dangerous. Aside 
from meeting the people and 
learning about their habits and 
way of life, Gus did some watercolors. He even sold a few which 
brought him back to Pittsburgh a 
richer man than when he left. He 
then wrote an account of his sum
mers misadventures and proceed
ed to win the Martin Leisser 
award as the student who spent 
the most interesting summer.
Gus is the one who does those 
ultra-modern Technical covers. 
Aside from that, he is a member 
of the Beaux Arts Honorary and 
Pi Delta Epsilon, and is an artist 
on the Thistle staff. He was the 
Art Editor of the Scottie, and for 
years he has been the chief sign 
painter for all the school dances.
His hobbies aside from travel
ing, include hiking and listening 
to outdoor symphony music. He 
also enjoys reading, Thoreau es
pecially, and for him, trying to 
understand people is both worth
while and interesting. One of Gus 
regrets is that he never had a 
chance to take Dr. Schoens Phi
losophy course. His taste in art 
includes Gauguins paintings, Per
sian and Oriental prints, and psy
chological movies like The Sev
enth Veil.
He avoided the question of 
women everytime by changing 
the topic to the relationship of 
physics and industrial designing.
As a final note in the part Gus 
has played in campus activities, 
the Tartan flag, the only change 
in the new Tartan that anyone no
ticed, was an original Kermes de
sign. Yes, Gus certainly proves the 
falsity of the scandalous rumors 
that the 4th floor Fine Arts is an 
ivory tower far apart from the 
rest of the school. (Ed. note.See, 
we P&Ds do get around.)
A personal checking account affords 
a practical means of keeping simple 
records of receipts and expenditures. 
Such records are extremely helpful 
in budgeting expenses and making 
out tax returns.

This change comes in hand with 
a reorganization of the adminis
tration in Evening Classes and 
Summer Sessions. Director Cleetons administration of Evening 
Classs will be in accordance with 
policies of Curriculum Committees 
and the Educational Senate, all of 
which he is a member, and in ac
cordance with administrative pro
cedures established by the Execu
tive Board and by the Directors 
whose activities are represented in 
the operation of Evening Classes 
and the Summer Session.
Mr. McKelway was appointed 
Register of Evening Classes. He 
will continue as Secretary of the 
Committees on Calendar and 
Schedules and assist the Director 
in conducting Evening Classes and 
Summer Session operation.
Professor Charles B. Stanton, 
former Supervisor of Evening 
Classes, has been appointed Spe

of the Controller.
Editors Farewell
It is always sad to say Fare
well, but the time has come to 
bid goodbye to the PLAID. It has 
been fun and grief combined witb 
sweat ng out'each issue. Some 
times we reached rock bottom 
and there was absolutely nothing 
o print. If the 
r at times, you 
e had to meet 
not. Next year 
with an increased student body, 
there will no doubt be more af
fairs and more activities about 
which to report.
The circulation of the PLAID 
this year was a dismal failure. No 
one realizes that more than we, 
but this was a result of there being 
so few workers to do the so many 
necessary things that the public
ation of a paper entails. Plans are 
now underway to establish a meth
od of getting the PLAID to each 
student.
Yes, it was a lot of grief and fun, 
but now it is over. I want to thank 
the staff for their loyal support. 
Without them there would have 
been no paper. They are the peo
ple who deserve the credit and 
th orchid so generously given to 
me in last weeks interview. 
Thanks a million, staff! Thanks al
so to McKelway for his help and 
to Mrs. Hays, Union Hostess, for

Spring Carnival
Most recent postwar develop
ment was the return of Spring 
Carnival. With Carnival the social 
calendar hit a new high. In spite 
of rain and cold weather, everyone 
declared that it was terrifically 
wonderful from the carnival atmo
sphere of barkers, booths, and ferris wheel on the cut to the evening 
of romantic fancing in the gym. 
Differing from many other rvled 
affairs, Carnival seemed to be orThe telephone in the Plaid of
fice is a handy instrument to have 
around, but never was it more 
useful than when we phoned 
Stephen Delli Gatti for an inter
view this evening. Even though we 
have never met Stephen person
ally, we know we should find him 
an engaging personality because 
of the appealing manner in which 
he cooperated with your reporter 
in graciously answering many in
quiries.
Stephen lives in Carrick on Red 
Rose Avenue when he is not work
ing with the Rust Engineering 
Company as a designing drafts
man. ^.lthough he attends classes 
in heat power engineering two 
nights a week, he still finds time 
to enjoy family life with his wife 
and five children. This night 
school student has received his 
bachelor of science degree in Civil 
Engineering through his attend
ance here at Techs evening 
school, and he intends to continue 
until he attains his ambition in 
lifea masters degree in Civil 
Engineering. We know he has per
sistence in this goal because he 
has been coming here since 1932.
While on the topic of engineeringhe commented that the last Engi
neering Banqut was really en
joyable. From this statement 
alone we can surmise that he has 
a great deal of humor! According 
to Stephen the evening students 
should have more social functions 
which would bring the evening 
students to closer harmony with 
one another. An open letter col
umn in the Plaid would serve as 
a medium for the expression of the 
evening students opinion, was an
other suggestion.
Now we have come to a most 
delicate topicfood! Rare steaks, 
french fries and fried mushjrooms 
(especially the way his wife fixes 
them) just hit the spot with 
Stephen. Another favorite pas
time is spending an evening at the 
movies enjoying a musical com
edy or reading the technical pub
lications at home. He also devotes 
an evening with the bowling 
league at Rust Engineering Co. He 
admits that attending night school 
alone is a hobby in itself.
Before we hang up, we want to 
thank you Stephen for ypur con
genial attitude in accepting our 
call, and we shall be looking for
ward to seeing you again next fall.
So Long ....
Since next week is the week of 
final exams, this will be the last 
issue of the PLAID for the current 
semester. We are taking this op
portunity to tell you how much 
we enjoyed bringing the news of 
the Evening School to you. We 
hope it has been interesting 
enough to keep you reading the 
paper from week to week all 
through the year. We have tried 
to keep you posted on all of the 
social affairs in which you would 
be directly concerned, as well as to 
give you the latest gossip about 
your classmates and associates.
Next year, we will be back to 
resume activities and would like 
to think that you will be back also 
to give us your support. Perhaps, 
next year, you will have a light 
schedule and will find it possible 
to come out and help us make an 
interesting publication (or the 
other students. We feel sure you 
would enjoy working on the staff, 
for it is one of the best ways to 
get acquainted with a friendly 
group of people. So, well be 
looking for you next year.
The question arises whether our 
public officials should be totally 
responsive to the will of the elec
torate, or whether our representa
tives should exercise some initi
ative and leadership to guide that 
electorate along the proper road.
A definition of the proper road 
is now in order. Is it the views 
and opinions of the so called plu
tocracy, selfishy interested in the 
perpetuity of its own small pow
erful group? Is it the philosophy 
of management of big business 
spearheaded by the N.A.M., in
terested solely in profits? Is it the 
direction so vociferously advanced 
by that blatant group of union 
leaders, personified by that bettle-browed leader of the mine 
workers. Is it the course so per
sistently and rabidly advocated by 
the extreme leftists? The answer 
is definitely NO. The proper road 
is that road which will result in 
the greates good to society as a 
whole.
The disgraceful conduct of some 
of our representatives in the Con
gress is a blot on democracy. By 
their deliberate evasive tactics, 
they are as effectively sabotaging
our reconversion as if they were 
fifth columnists. On matters per
taining to the public welfare, for 
fear of disapproval of some minor
ity pressure group, some of our 
leaders are displaying supine, inert 
intellect unworthy of our coun
try. In spite of the protestations 
of pressure groups, the Congress 
must act with the welfare of our 
country in mind. To so act is a 
true criterion of leadershiplead
ership which is definitely lacking 
at the present.
The crying need of democracy 
has not changed in the least from 
its inception centuries ago. At 
that time it required an honest, 
fearless leadership and an under
standing, intelligent electorate. 
And today the requirements are 
precisely the same.

Were working hard to catch up. 
The Bell System is adding two 
million more miles of Long 
Distance circuits and training 
thousands of new operators. But 
for some time to come there will 
con tinue to be delays on some calls.
The rush on the Long Distance 
wires may not last much longer. 
We ask that, in the meantime, 
you help by making only 
necessary calls.
