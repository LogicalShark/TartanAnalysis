Xmas Vacation Same; 
Semester Gap Smaller
In order to make up lor the 
week of classes, November 27 to 
December 2, cancelled because of 
the snow storm, the Executive 
Board, on recommendation of the 
committee on Calendar and 
Schedules, has voted to make only 
one change in the calendar.
This change relates to the per
iod from January 22 to February 
3, 1951. The week of January 22- 
27 will be used for regular class 
work in both day and evening 
classes. The week of January 29- 
February 3 will be used for final 
examinations in day and evening 
classes.
There will be no change in the 
Christmas recess or in the sec
ond semester calendar, in^uding 
registration aates and the begin
ning of second-semester classes.
Carnegie Tech has received a $15,000 grant from the Richard* 
King Mellon Foundation to do the spade work on a pioneering pro
gram of professional education for women, President _ J. C. Warner
announced today. ?-----------------------------------------------------
The new program will, in effect, 
be the first major extension into 
Margaret Morrison of the now 
nationally known Carnegie Plan 
of Professional Education.
School authorities expect it to 
be as revolutionary in the field of 
professional education for women 
as similar Carnegie programs have 
been in science, engineering and 
the fine arts.
Same As Carnegie Plan 
The basic aim of the new 
womens program will be the same 
as that of the Carnegie Plan, 
namely, to give students what it 
takes to go on learning about 
work and life from experience 
after college days are over.
But, Dr. Warner said today,
because this Carnegie Plan ex
tension wall be designed specifical
ly for women, it will have one 
more aim.
We hope to make the funda
mental things which our women 
students learn in preparing for 
their professions here equally val
uable to them whether they be
come professional women with 
jobs to do or married women with 
families to rear.
To Start On Small Scale 
Following a pattern established 
in the development of the Car
negie Plan, the first experimental 
work for the new womens pro
gram will be done slowly on a 
small scale, and then will be ex
panded.
The $15,000 Mellon grant 
which will be given in three year
ly installments, will be used over

Many Engineering Jobs Created 
By New Mobilization Program
Most Engineering Grads Of 1 950 Absorbed
By Still Rapidly Expanding Industries
Employment opportunities for engineering graduates have im
proved greatly since early 1950, according to the U. S. Department 
of Labors Bureau of Labor Statistics. The mobilization program has 
increased the demand for engineers so much that.employers are now
seeking additional personnel, after#-----------------------------------------------------
absorbing the engineering schools been one of the nations fastestrecord 1950 graduating class of 
50,000.
Hiring of engineers has been 
much heavier in 1950 than in 
1949, although, in January, em
ployers had reported to the Engi
neers Joint Council that they ex
pected to hire fewer engineers 
this year than last.
As defense production rises 
over the coming months, and the 
Armed Forces are expanded, the 
demand for engineers will in
crease further. Recent graduates 
who may have entered non-engi
neering positions can today find 
opportunities for engineering em
ployment.
Engineering Growing Fast
For high school students and 
others considering whether to en
ter engineering training, the pro
fession offers very good employ
ment prospects. The Bureaus 
Occupational Outlook Summary 
of March 8, 1950, which was bas
ed on the assumption of peace
time conditions, pointed out that
one
growing occupations md will 
probably remain so over the long 
run.
Defense mobilization will con
tinue to add to the peacetime de
mand for engineering graduates 
for the next few years at least. 
Moreover, the number of fresh
men engineering students has 
been declining since 1946, largely 
because of the drop n enroll
ments of veterans in U.S. col
leges and universities. As a re
sult, the number of graduates will 
decrease over the next several 
years.
Engineering Graduates Down
According to estimates, which 
are based on preliminary reports 
oI 1950 fall enrollments to the 
U.S. Office of Education and the 
American Society for Engineering 
and which allow for 
e normal number of drop-outs, 
the number of engineering graduin 1951 will be down to about 
17,000. This is less than the avere peacetime demand, The drop 
in engineering enrollments will 
be intensified to the extent that

As a result of the additional ex
pense incurred from having a na
tionally-known band, the frater
nities have decided that there will 
be no flowers.
The formal is expected to be a 
success because of the fine orches

How Much?
Beginning with Spring Carnival last May and coming to a cli
max this fall at Homecoming, the clamor of the student body for 
name bands at major all-school dances has steadily increased. In 
the Homecoming issue of the Tartan, a petition signed by 500 students 
appeared, stating that they would be willing to pay more for a good 
name band.
Ordinarily, so large a representation of students would be good 
enough for Spring Carnival committee to plan on having a name 
band. However, there was no indication of whether students would 
be willing to go as high as necessary.
In this issue, the Inquiring Reporter took a poll of students to 
pee just what they were willing to pay. The poll, appearing on the 
opposite page, once again indicates that Carnegie students are in j 
favor of having a name band. However, less than 40% were will
ing to pay as high as $5.00 a ticket for the usual two nights of , 
dancing.
What most people seem to be failing to realize is the fact that 
the ticket for the Friday and Saturday night dances is the only 
real source of income for the Spring Carnival committee. It must 
therefore pay for all expenses incurred throughout the long week
end.!Probably the two biggest drawbacks which the committee in 
charge of the dance face are the tremendous taxes, both federal and 
city, and the limited capacity of the gym, 750 couple. If the taxes 
were lower, and the committee could sell 1,000 tickets, then there 
would be no difficulty at all in offering a name band at a very 
reasonable price.
All this discussion is merely to point out the difficulties that the 
committee in charge of Spring Carnival encounters in planning the 
biggest campus week-end of the year. In all probability, the stu
dents will be able to dance to one of the leading bands in the nation 
next May, even though the price may have to be between five and 
six dollars a ticket.
^Dear Santa*   
With the Christmas season already upon us, we would like to 
take time off and write a letter to Santa Claus, taking it upon our
selves to ask for presents for a few campus organizations and per
sonalitiesduring 1951.
First of all, we would like to see President Jake* Warners 
stocking filled with a check for 2 million dollars, to go towards 
the building of modern dormitories for men. Next, a bequest to 
the Steffan funds so that Buddy Overend could bring in one dozen 
football players and four good basketball players each year.
To Dave See and the intramural board, a little better luck with 
the weather in 1951. To Student Council, the election of eleven 
capable and interested students in the coming election to help the 
handful of good councilmen presently in office.
Hows Our Coverage?
Is your organization getting coverage in the Tartan?
There is a reporter assigned to each organization on campus, 
tc cover all functions of news value. If our reporters are slipping 
up, we would like to know. There should be no reason why your 
events are not receiving attention in these pages. If they are not, 
please let us know immediately.

(Ed. NoteIn this issue we present for the first time Think It 
Over, written by the author. Mr. Ahlstrom claims to be an author
ity upon college life. He bases this claim in part upon the fact that 
it was his fortune to have been a lower freshman six times.
We must warn readers, however, that Mr. Ahlstrom's articles 
are printed as they are received and that it is the Editor's opinion 
that his writings show substantial cause for his earlier reversals.)
It is time that some of Carnegie*-----------------------------------------------
Techs attributes were critically 
analyzed. I should like to start 
by reviewing the most impressive 
of Carnegie's many impressives; 
the schools holesomeness.
To many the realization may 
come as a revelation that this is 
actually the fiftieth of CIT's holy 
years. In fact it might be said 
that CITs whole existence has 
been one of holiness; that for fifty 
years CIT has been in a hole.
You desire proof?
Lady Shoveler 
If you will be kind enough to 
refer to the Tartan Homecoming 
issue, page 5, columns -1 and 2, 
top, ^reserve room, main library, 
you will notice that the photo
graph found there shows a group 
of CIT men watching a lady with 
a shovel digging a hole. Exposed 
during Carnegies infancy fifty 
years ago, this picture, of proof 
positive that holes were there in 
the beginning, is also proof that 
another of CITs traditions has al
ways been with us; that of gen
tlemanliness. Where else would 
one see derbied stalwarts watch
ing a lady? <
Look at the hole in back of 
Margaret Morrison. Is this hole, 
which now holds the weight of the 
Tartan's outdoor athletics in its 
hollowed cavity, the result of the 
digging of the lady mentioned in 
the preceding paragraph? The answer is obviously no. The hole 
she dug is in front of the main 
entrance and is easily distin
guished by the railroad tracks.
Clear Swindle
I know, youre going to ask how 
the railroad tracks got there. Then 
as now, the Carnegie Plan was in 
operation and thoughts of im
provement were ever uppermost 
in the simple minds of the found
ing fathers. Therefore when it 
was discovered that the good 
ladys diggings could not be used 
to divert the Monongahela into a 
private swimming pool the found
ing fathers sold the hole to the 
railroad in what everyone realized 
was a swindle, for it was plain 
that the railroad had no use for 
the declevities.
Fifty years have passed since 
the first humble hole was dug, and 
in that time many new holes have 
appeared and have been covered 
up by the administration in one 
form or another. Every year has 
seen its state of depression in the 
CIT campus. To this very day you 
may lift your nose over any win
dow sill, Kilroy fashion, and you 
will see. a hole. Or more impor
tant, if you fail to watch the path 
of your soles as they wander aim
lessly through college life you may 
find that you have actually fallen 
into a Pitt.

SHALL WE TRY FOR 31; . . The
Thanksgiving holiday was a lost 
week-end for many Tech people. 
The Dean of Women was stranded 
in Cleveland, while Dr. Dickinson 
plowed his way out of the big 
snow in Butler.
PIKE'S PEAK . . . PiKA frater
nity narrowly escaped losing a 
valuable frat member. Their mas
cot, a cocker spaniel tagged 
Pike, fractured his pelvis when 
he was hit by a car on Forbes 
Street. However, the patient is do
ing fine at last report.
THE LAME WILL WALK . . . 
Some students claim that the mul
titudinous holes in the campus 
lawns were dug by civil engineers 
who are trying out new equip
ment, But, public relations man, 
John Fockler, believes the holes 
are booby traps. Last Thursday, 
John sprained his ankle, twisting 
it in a darn hole on the cut. 
MIGHTY MOUSE . . , There is a 
saying; If you build a better 
mouse trap, the world will beat a 
path to your door. That path 
leads to the door of Whitfield Hall, 
where a graduate constructed an 
electric mouse trap carrying 800 
volts. That is a potent weapon! 
ALLEN AND HIS EGG . . . Dur
ing the radio program, The Big 
Show, Fred Allen cracked a yuk,

Chicago, go to Central Station. 
TANK TALK . . . The roaring 
sound in Industries Hall is only a 
motor wheelbarrow which is 
carrying cement for a new floor in 
the building. Lets hope this quiets 
the fears of war conscious engi
neers who swear they hear tanks 
rolling through Industries.
SILVER URNS . . . When the Sig
ma Nus moved into their new 
house on More wood Ave., they dis
covered unexpected wealth. Hid
den in a cupboard on the third 
floor were two beautiful silver 
urns. Now the boys use the urns 
for ash trays. Thats what it is to 
be plutocrats.
THE CAISSONS . . . Jack Riehl, 
former Tech basketball star, is 
now in khaki with the U.S.A. 8th

HERE COMES THE BRIDE . . .
Morewood Gardens has been used 
for many things, but never for a 
weeding. During the snow storm, 
however, two Tech grads, Mac 
Clark and Margie Power, were 
married in Morewood. Everyone 
was there except the minister; he 
almost missed the wedding because 
of the snow.
CHRISTwIAS SPIRIT . . . Seven 
fraternities are having Christmas 
parties for orphan children. Delta 
Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kap

INQUIRING REPORTER
Do You Want A Name Band? 
77% Of Students Say They Do
Big Names Cost More Than Most Will Pay; 
Limited Gym Capacity Another Big Drawback
To have or not to have name bands for big school dances is a 
question that has been kicking around Carnegie for several years.
The question flared up this year with the publication in the 
October 26 Tartan issue of a petition signed by 500 students. The
petition stated that the students ?----------------------------------------------
would be willing to pay a little 
more to have name bands at big 
school affairs.
The inquiring reporter conduct
ed a straw vote of 75 male stu
dents asking: Do you want a name 
band for Spring Carnival? If so, 
what is the maximum price per 
couple you would pay for such a 
dance?
The result of the vote showed:

One of the students polled said 
he would pay whatever has to be 
paid to get a name band. How
ever, anothes said he would 
rather dance to records. Then, 
several students declared that the 
only name band they Would pay 
more to hear was Ray Anthony.
Name Cost Money
The opinions expressed by the 
students are not at all consistent 
with the facts of the situation. 
First of all, the big name bands 
such as Vaughn Monroe, Ralph 
Flanagan, and Woody Herman 
rank in approximately the $4,000 
per night category. Bands like 
Elliot Lawrence, Tommy Tucker, 
and Vincent Lopez cost from 
$1,500 to over $2,000 for a onenight stand.
In addition to the band expense, 
the ticket cost has to cover a 30% 
tax in Pittsburgh, decoration costs, 
and publicity expense.
Gym Capacity Limit
Another fact that must be con
sidered is the capacity of the gym
nasium. The gym holds a maxi
mum of 750 couples.
These facts add up to just one 
thingStudents will have to pay 
a lot more than $5 for a ticket to 
dance to a big name band. Figure 
it out mathematically. Over
whelming, isnt it?
Of course, every student at Tech 
wants a name band at a low price. 1 Lets not be idealists, however, 
i This is a real problem. How can 
Carnegie Tech finance a big name 
band.for Spring Carnival?

A1 Moore reported to Council 
that the election originally slat
ed for December 12 had been

in the gym for March 3, another 
by the Freshman Class for Thistle 
Hall for the Freshman Dance on

Waynesburg Cops 56-55 Win 
With Last Minute Field Goal
Tartans Blow Victory Margin In Final Quarter; 
Yellow jackets Come From Behind To Win
In as thrilling a finish as the Skibo gym has seen, the Carnegie 
Tartans had their home debut spoiled Saturday as the Waynesburg 
Yellowjackets eked out a narrow 56-55 victory over the locals.
Leading 46-37 as the final quarter began, the Ski bos were vic
tims of a last quarter Waynesburg^ 
rally. Playing spotty ball, the 
Tartans cooled off in the wrong 
spot as the Waynesburgers cli
maxed their drive in the final 25 
seconds with a field goal which 
won the game.
Jackets Led
The game was nip and tuck all 
the way, with first one, and then 
the other team showing flashes of 
brilliance and inconsistency.
Waynesburg was unable to match 
the general floor play of the Tar
tan squad, but the Tartins couldnt 
cope with the deadly set shot ac
curacy of the Jackets.
The first quarter was Waynesburgs as they finished on top of 
a 16-14 score. However, in the 
early part of the second stanza,
Carnegie took command and held 
the lead until a Waynesburg tally 
as the half ended left the visitors 
with a 32-31 advantage.
In the third quarter the Skibos 
showed the form which they were 
expected to display. Led by Hilary 
Holste, who has been alternating 
with Connie Hammann at the cen
ter spot, the Tartans outscored the 
Jackets 15-5.
In the early part of the fourth 
period the Skibos seemed to fall 
apart while Waynesburg, taking 
advantage of the opportunity, be
gan to work back into contention.
Reversing the third quarter situa
tion, the Jackets tallied 15 markers to the Skibos 5 and took the lead again at 52-51. The Tartan cause wasnt helped as Holste left 
the game via the personal foul route with eight minutes remain
ing.
Lead Cut
Hans Ackerman shoved the Tar
tans out in front again with two 
quick set shots for four points and 
a three point lead. However, guard 
Harry Fowler, came through with 
a beautiful set for Waynesburg to 
cut the Carnegie lead to a single 
point.
With a minute to play, the Tar
tans attempted to freeze the ball, 
but lost possession when Tom 
Beck, their high scorer, stepped 
out of bounds. With 25 seconds 
left, Jim Stefancin, high-point man 
for the night with 11, heaved a 
desperation throw at the basket.
The shot missed, but lanky 6-4 
sub-center, John Clarke, was there 
to tip it in for a 56-55 Waynes
burg lead and the ball game.
Carnegies last second attempts 
to score failed as Tom Craigs lay
up was blocked, and the Jackets 
took the ball for a freeze until 
the final gun.
Cheer Leaders!
Candidates for eheerleading 
re requested to report to

Defeats Skihos
Floormen Rout Barons 
For First Season Win
The dope sheets ran true to form 
as Coach Mel Cratsley and his 
Carnegie Tartans traveled to De
troit, December 1, for their open
ing game with Lawrence Tech. 
Although hoping to repeat last 
years upset of a highly favored 
Blue Devil team, the Skibos 
werent quite able to turn the 
trick and came home on the short 
end of a 69-56 score.
The team was hampered par
tially by the lack of practice the 
week before the game. The snow 
delayed the return of players and 
no full practice could be held after 
Thanksgiving until the Wednes
day before the game on Friday.
The Tartans, although losing, 
managed to give a good account of 
themselves. Behind most of the 
way, they tied the score, 51-51, in 
the fourth quarter before the roof 
finaly fell in.
The Tartans broke into the vic
tory column with their second 
game at Steubenville, December 6, outclasing them by a score of 
72-37. With Carnegie scoring al
most at will, Craig, Beck and Mc
Cullough amassed enough points 
between them to equal the total 
of the Steubenville team.

Bisons Forced To Rebuild Team; 
Titans Still Strong Despite Losses
Tomorrow night the Tartan basketball squad will travel to 
Bethany, West Virginia, to take on the Bisons of Bethany College. 
Last year the Skibos topped the Bisons in their only meeting by the 
--------------------------------------------------:?score of 72-50.
CRAIG SCORES AGAINST WAYNESBURG
Pictured above is Tom Craig as he attempted a push shot in 
last Saturdays rame with Waynesburg College. Leu Bianchi is 
shown getting in position for a possible rebound.
Last season the Bisons rolled up 
a record of 10 wins as against 15 
losses. The wins were scored 
against such teams as Rio Grande, 
Grove City, Muskingham, Thiel, 
and St. Vincent.
The Bisons split two series with 
Geneva and West Virginia Wes
leyan, and, in addition to CIT, 
they lost to Wabash, Davis & Elk
ins, Washington and Jefferson, and 
Mount Union.
Large Schedule 
Bethany this season will play a 
game schedule against teams 
the same caliber as last year.
on December 
was canthe recent snowAlthough the Bisons have lost a 
major portion of its first five from 
last year, Coach Glenn Johnson 
be able to pull a winning 
from first year varsity men 
and several other newcomers to 
the squad.
Westminster On Deck 
Next Saturday evening the Ski
bos will host the Towering Tiof Westminster College. This 
will be the forty-third meeting of 
two teams with the Titans 
holding the series edge with 32 
and 10 losses.
One significant record that the 
men of New Wilmington are at
tempting to keep in tact this year 
is that they havent lost a game on 
their home court since 1942. This 
constitutes a string of 68 consecu
tive home court victories.
Last years record of 25 vic
tories was the greatest number of 
games ever won by a team at 
Westminster in one season since

Six Skibo Gridders Named 
On All-Pennsylvania Teams
Even though the Carnegie Tech basketball team has play
ed only three games to date, a few of its so-called loyal fol
lowers have already begun to ask What's wrong with the 
team or I thought we were supposed to have a good team 
this year. All this pessimistic comment stems from the fact 
that the Plaid hoopsters have been unfortunate enough to 
drop two of their first three engagements.
Certainly these few crepe-hangers, and luckily they are 
very few in number, should be reminded that they are passing 
judgment much earlier than they safely can. The thirteen-point 
setback by Lawrence Tech, a team that was generally rated far 
above the Skibos, was far from humiliating, particularly when 
one considers that coach Mel Cratsleys proteges had had very 
little practice for almost a week prior to the game.
At Steubenville the Tartans showed that they had the 
firepower necessary to pile up the points, while last Satur
days one-point loss to a good Waynesburg team was just 
one of those games that could have gone either way. On 
the basis of these three games alone, a fair estimate of the 
teams strength cannot be made.
Prior to the season opener coach Cratsley, one of the better 
coaches in the game today, made the statement that this years 
team is as good as the aggregation that represented Carnegie 
last season. Who is qualified to question this statement, even 
after the Skibos have played three games? With veterans Len 
Bianchi, Tom Beck, and Bob McCullugh back in action, the Plaid 
floor team possesses the necessary experience. Tom Craig, who 
was outstanding as a freshman last year, has the ability to be
come even more valuable to the team, while Connie Hammann 
and Hilary Holste are both much improved and can handle the 
center position without any trouble.

Simcic Most 
Valuable Small 
College Player
Six Carnegie Tech football play
ers were cited recently by Inter
national News Service and the As
sociated Press for their outstand
ing gridiron play during the 1950 
season. These six gridders were 
named to the all-state teams pub
lished by the two news organiza
tions.
Halfback Nick Simcic and guard 
Floyd Wiseman were rated as two 
of the foremost players in the 
state by both INS and AP. The 
two Tartan stars were accorded 
first team berths on the INS AllPennsylvania small college team, 
which is selected from among the 
players of all schools throughout 
the state with the exception of the 12 major colleges.
In addition to making the first 
team, Simcic was chosen by Inter
national News Service as the most 
valuable small college player in 
the state of Pennsylvania.
INS also picked Fritz Wilson as 
one of the ends on its third team, 
w^ile end Lou Fougere and tackle 
Clyde Stahle were given honorable 
mention.
The Associated Press, which se
lects its team from among the 
players of all the schools in the 
state rather than separating the 
large college from the small col
lege eleven, chose four Skibo stal
warts.
AP determines the members of 
its all-state team through a poll of 
all the coaches in the state as 
well as sports writers covering 
games played by Pennsylvania 
teams.
Wiseman, the husky, 190-pound 
lineman from Monessen, copped 
one of the guard positions on the 
second eleven, teaming with Bill 
Ciaravino of Lehigh. He ranked 
just behind Bernie Lemonick of 
j Penn and Alex Duplicki of Bucki nell, the first teim guards.
In naming Wiseman to the AllPennsylvania team, the Associated 
I Press described him as one of the 
 best guards ever to play for Car
negie Tech.
Simcic was accorded one of the 
| halfback positions on the AP third 
| team, and Wilson ana quarterback 
| Quent Holtz received honorable 
{ mention.

Seasoned Squad Back
Westminster will place a start
ing lineup of seasoned lettermen 
on the floor this year and they 
also have a good half-dozen strong 
reserves to back them up. This 
is inspite of the loss of four of 
last years starters including AllStar Alan McCullough.
Four of this year's starters 
played almost as much varsity 
ball as the four lost through grad| uation.
j The offense thrown in by Coach 
| Pappy Washabaugh will be 
I sparked by a fast break and 
I tricky ball handling. The Titans 
will not lack for height due to the 
! presence of a pair of 6' 4'* for| wards and a 6' 3'' center. Both 
the guards are also at least six 
j feet tall.
High Scorers Back
The scoring twins of the New 
Wilmington men will again be on

 King and Guard Johnny Abraham 
( last year scored 322 and 363 points 1 consecutively to pace the Titans 
I attack.

[Continued from page 4] 
tans were recently handicapped 
by the extra week of vacation 
which limited the squad to only 
one week in the water before the 
opening meet.
With the return of practically 
the entire team, Coach Sofield 
should be awarded for his efforts 
by an extremely successful sea
son for the Skibo mermen, and 
they should prove to be strong 
contenders for the Penn-Ohio 
championships to be held later 
this year.
The Tartans will open their 
home swimming season tomorrow 
afternoon when they take on the 
pool squad from Fenn College.
