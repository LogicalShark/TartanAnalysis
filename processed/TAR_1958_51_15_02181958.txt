Picnic To Open 
In Little Theatre 
On February 25
By S. A. B.
Picnic, the play which recently 
was produced in the movies and 
from which came the popular 
sC g> is coming to the Little The
ater, opening a two weeks en
gagement on February 25, 1958. 
Swaggering around as Hal will be 
Ed Martz, and playing the role of 
the seduced Madge, will be Diana 
Muciniecks.
The locale of the action is a 
small town in the heartlands of 
America where sooner or later 
love rules all the activities. The 
play tangentially incates that 
ile there is life, there is hope 
for the spinister school teacher, 
Rosemary, alternately performeS 
by Janet Waggener and Sherry 
Moulton, even though she may 
have to capture her man by brute 
force. The presence of a hand
some, rugged and irresponsible 
young man moves her to action.
Those who hope to see an actual 
picnic will be disappointed, how
ever, they will become aware of 
V at goes on at small town pic
nics, unless, of course, they al
ready know. Some may feel that 
the small town picnic is just like 
a large city picnic, however, this is 
irrelevant.

Call Day
Any organization, interest
ed in making a call or pre
senting an award at Call Day, 
Spring Carnival, May 2, and 
which has not yet been con
tacted by the Call Day chairmay may secure a form for 
this purpose at the office of 
the Dean of Students. All 
forms must be completed and 
submitted to Cissie Rafferty, 
'forewood Gardens, 6D4, by 
February 27.
Association offices now in Web 
Hall are being readied in one of 
the smaller buildings on the pro
perty to the rear of Morewood 
Gardens. Web Hall is expected to 
come down early this summer.
With work on projects set forth in the building program due to^ 
begin this summer a few preparatory moves are being made. Not 
the least of these is a $30,000-$40,000 renovation of the old field house 
in Maggie Murph. It will replace space now occupied by the Military 
Department in Skibo, which will not be available when Skibo is torn
down for the library. ?-----------------------------------------------------
The new area will include two 
classrooms (one to serve as a lab 
when so desiredfor the Corps 
(^ Engineers and the other for the 
Signal Corps), three offices, a 
radio room, and a supply room.
This arrangement will concen
trate the military in AH and 
MMCC with the range and supply 
in one building.
The completion of the building 
program will conveniently pro
vide a large drill field where the 
Bowl is now. The new facilities 
are expected to be ready for use 
n&:t fall.
Web Hall Comes Down 
At present work has only begun 
and the area is being relieved of 
great quantities of rubble. The 
work of a pneumatic drill ahs 
probably been heard by many 
Maggie Murphs in classes up
stairs.

construction, alternate facilities

Independents 
Can Nominate 
Carnival Queen
A special effort has been made 
by this years Spring Carnival 
Committee to interest non-sorority 
women in a queen campaign. Al
though independent groups have 
always been eligible ior queen 
competition, they have in the past 
shown little interest in a campaign 
effort.
The Womens Dormitory Coun
cil has agreed to sponsor a cam
paign by an indjepeadent.group of 
dormitory women. Any dorm resi
dent who is interested in partici
pating in the campaign is urged to 
contact her tower president as 
soon as possible. The committee 
hopes that Citcom will also or
ganize a campaign, thereby mak
ing this years Carnival more of 
an all-school event.
Womens Competition
Only one trophy will be award
ed for womens competitions this 
year, while two will be given for 
the best queen campaigns; these 
will be judged on presentations, 
gimmicks, posters, and pictures, 
and will be independent of the 
outcome of the election.
Rules for campaign procedure 
will be announced by the middle 
of March, and will, in general, be 
similar to last years rules, with 
the Fine Arts lawn being used for 
presentation of the candidates. Al
so, wider publicity through better 
television and newspaper coverage 
is planned for this Carnival.
Alpha Phi Omega is again 
sponsoring an Ugly Man On 
Campus contest this year. 
Those wishing to enter are 
requested to submit a 5 x 7 
photo of themselves along 
with their name and the or
ganization sponsoring them to 
the dean of students office 
not later than Tuesday, Febhuary 25.
Tech Approves 
Jazz By Woody; 
More To Folloiv
Last Friday night Woody Her
man and his band presented an 
informal jazz concert in Techs 
gym that was enthusiastically re
ceived by a crowd of about 500 
students.
The band played many wellknown jazz numbers  The 
Preacher, Early Auturtin',' ~The 
Lullaby of Birdland, and one that 
Herman introduced as Like It, 
The Blues Man, Like. The 
Golden Wedding featured the 
Gauds drum era, and Herman on 
his clarinet; while the old stand
ard, Skyliner, featured the 
world-famous jazz trombonist, Bill 
Harris. As an added attraction, 
The A1 Belletto Sextet played 
Jeepers Creepers and Papa 
Joes and later accompanied the 
vocalist Miss Jerry Winters, as 
she sang Somebody Loves Me 
and a special arrangement of Al
ways You.
Student Congress noted that the 
concert drew a fairly good turn
out considering -hat this was the 
first event of this particular type 
to appear on Techs campus. Due 
to the apparent enthusiasm of the 
student body, there will *be more 
events like last Fridays scheduled 
in the future if a similar oppor
tunity is offered.

In the most thrilling meet of the season, Techs swim

So speaks a member of Prince
tons 1957 graduating class, one of 
seven to write anonymous, candid 
essays summing up their thoughts 
on careers, marriage, religion, 
success, happiness, the present 
generation and similarly provoca
tive topics. The essays, appearing 
in the current (Feb. 17) issue of 
Life Magazine, provide a solid
straight Tartan victory of the sea

Oberlin in the history of the

a perennial power in swimming 
participated in the Ohio Confer

University and Lehigh.
Techs medley relay unofficially 
broke the schools record, which 
was only beaten by 4 yards. Pat 
Crecine followed with a victory in

of his two wins.
In the butterfly, Mike Litch 
trailed his Oberlin oppoinent for 
150 yards and then sprinted home 
in the last 50 yards to a victory

Campus Chest Campaign results 
show that in regard to participa
tion this years campaign was j 
somewhat more successful than 
the 56-57 when about 45% of the; 
student body participated in the 
drive. The total amount collected ; 
in last falls campaign was four
teen dollars less than that collected : 
in the fall of fifty-six ($2967).
Over a period of the past five j 
years the percentage of participaj 
tion has increased causing a corj 
responding increase in the total i 
amount collected from $500 in 53- 1 
54 to a peak of almost $3000 last! 
year, an increase of 600%. Since ! 
the size of the student body has ; 
increased by only a small amount, I 
the statistics show that those stu' 
dents who have been inducting the 
campaigns have become more ef| 
fective in inducing the students 
to contribute.

point, Evelyn Alessio, one of last i

Todays Assembly 
Showed Sophocles 
To Be Realistic
This mornings 11:30 assembly 
in Fine Arts Theatre began a se
ries of five lectures by the English 
department. Todays subject, the 
seven extant plays of Sophocles, 
was discussed by Dr. A. Fred 
Sochatoff.
Dr. Sochatoff dealt mainly with 
the fact that Sophocles was con
cerned with living life realistic
ally and that consequently, what 
he had to say in the fifth cen
tury B.C. is as relevant now as it 
jwas then. Dr. Sochatoff illustrated 
this point by showing the social 
responsibility stressed in Sopho
cles plays apply to the present 
day.
Next Tuesday, February 25, Mr 
Norman Knox will discuss Chau
cer. His lecture will mainly con
cern the Canterbury Tales and 
why they are even today consid
ered among the most important 
works of English literature.

Tech History
From Farmland To Campus 
Tech Land Makes A Transition
By Toni Nelson
A hundred years ago one could never have imagined Techs cam
pus the way it is today. It is doubtful that Mother Nature ever 
planned it this way either. In the 1850s, there was an unpromising 
range of land, three miles from the meeting of the Allegheny and
Monongahela Rivers, used for^----------------------------------------------------
truck gardens by the people of 
Pittsburgh. It was known as Chad
wick Farm.
The land was treeless and none 
too fertile; about all that could 
be raised there was cabbage. It 
was all either sharp hillside or 
deep ravine, with hardly a level 
square rod of ground in the whole 
area of 32 acres. There was a long 
gulch running the length of the 
campus, the remains of which can 
be seen as Tech Bowl today. At 
one end of the gulch was a quarry 
of Morgantown sandstone and at 
the other end a small pond, mostly 
mud. At the bottom of the gulch 
a trickle of a creek made its way 
westward to the Monongahela.
The Chadwicks Farm had run
ning through it east and west a 
dirt road called Joncaire Street, 
named for Sieur de Chabert Jon
caire, a Frenchman who was in 
the Pittsburgh area between 1749 
and 1753. Joncaire Street pro
vided a route for the Yellow 
Line trolley which went from 
Oakland to Squirrel Hill. This 
was before rails were even 
thought of on Forbes Street. This 
line crossed the Baltimore and 
Ohio Railroad over a crude wood
en trestle and went under Schanley Bridge through a small arch 
which may still be seen behind 
Machinery Hall. It ran along the 
shoulder of the hill where Engi
neering Hall is now and contin
ued out Margaret Morrison Ave
nue across Forbes street and up 
to Squirrel Hill. Joncaire Street 
and the Yellow Line were 
gradually eaten up by the steam 
shovel as the grounds were grad
ed for the campus.
It is interesting to note that the 
word campus comes from the 
Latin word for field. How appro
priate this word is when one 
thinks of the barren hilly farm
land that was Techs campus not 
so long ago.

Student Congress 
Defeats Committee 
Chairmen Motion
At the last Congress meeting 
Philbricks proposal to open to the 
student body the chairmanship -of 
Spring Carnival, Homecoming,
Carnegie Union, Leadership Con
ference, and Freshman Orienta
tion was defeated.
The only other motion pending 
on this matter is one proposed by 
Susette Grove. Under her system 
the Congress committee from the 
student body at large would do 
the bulk of the job. If her motion 
be defeated, these chairmen will 
continue to come from the activi
ties honoraries.
AH School Functions
Congress passed a recommenda
tion of the executive council re
garding All School Functions. 
This requires that: 1. A written 
request stating the date, organi
zation, time, place, and type of 
activity must be submitted to the 
Executive Council of Student 
Congress within the first eight 
weeks of the semester preceeding 
the semester during which the 
event is to be held by the said or
ganization; 2. All requests for all 
school functions submitted to the 
executive council must allow time 
for their consideration as well as 
a vote by Student Congress withinin the first eight-week period 
of any semester; 3. There are no 
limitations to the number of times 
an organization may apply for an 
all school function; and 4. No 
weekend all school function may 
be held within 3 weeks of any 
other weekend all school function.
Prof. Beaman At 
Emerson Club
The Emerson Club, a group for 
undergraduates at the First Uni

ard B. Beaman, associate proJ - 
sor of painting, design and Sculp
ture, Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, speaking on Genesis of 
Crazy Ideas, Wednesday, Febru
ary 19.
Mr. Beaman has been at CIT 
since 1955. Before that time he 
was head of the art department at 
the University of Redlands, in Cal
ifornia 1939-1955. From 1950 to 
1952 he was Stickney Lecturer in 
art at California Institute of Tcjginology. He received a Ford Fel

by students from nearby colleges.
Students Ask 
Questions About 
WRITE Contest
Some questions have come to us 
from the members of the staffs of 
campus publications.
Q. Can an entry for the WRITE 
contest have been published be
fore?
A. No. The purpose of WRITE 
is to encourage new, original work 
on the part of all students. Also, 
to allow a previously published 
manuscript to qualify would be to 
introduce an element of unfair 
competition.
Q. If a member of the staff of 
a publication is given an assign
ment by his editor, can this as
sign be submitted?
A. Not before the March 15 
deadline. After this date, the in
dividual editors run the risk of 
duplicating a previously printed 
article, and since some of our pub
lications have only a few issues, 
this duplication might appear 
twice consecutively. It must be 
remembered that all entries be
come the property of Pi Delta Ep
silon, and they cannot be returned.
WRITE is open to the entire stu 
dent body of Carnegie Tech, in
cluding members of Pi Delta Ep
silon and the five participating 
publications. Judges will be mem
bers of the Tech faculty.

of varied backgrounds and points 
of view to comment freely on their 
lives and futures and guaranteed 
them absolute anonymity.
Generation Of The Third Eye 
Speaking generally of his gen
eration, the writer quoted above 
goes on to say: . . . The reason 
our generation has been accused 
of quietude is probably because 
our elders are afraid of our image 
. . . We are accused of not being 
rebellious enough. But our elders 
have done the rebelling for us . . . 
The redeeming characteristic of 
our generation is a certain rigor pf 
the intellect that . . . may some
day become a truly regenerative 
force. Conformity is the name 
most often given us . . . The sta
tistics are probably true, but that 
we recognize them as true, and 
are becoming increasingly sensi
tive to their consequences in our 
lives promises that many of us 
are going to escape the predictions 
set for our futures ... In regard 
to past motives of behavior, our 
third eye is destructive or irra
tional expectations. In regard to 
future motives of behavior, the 
third eye may discover those lim
ited and realizable forms of cre
ative action that will survive all 
the tests our critical consciences 
can pose.
From Defiant To Prudent 
Life calls the writers, who 
range from defiant individuals to 
prudent idealists, outspoken, selfreliant, ambitious and seriously 
speculative. Here are excerpts: 
On Life In General: **. . . It is 
easy to be a rebel, either ac
tively through iconoclasm or 
passively by total withdrawal.

Fitly
Life is what you make it, but 
in any case you have to live 
with it ... I realize that no 
one will do me any favors, 
but somehow Im not wor
ried.
. . Society demands a total 
commitment that I cannot 
give ... I believe in the sov
ereign individual, and feel 
myself at bay ... I want my 
contribution to life to be a 
living testimonial that indi
vidual freedom is compatible 
with ihe welfare and progress 
of society.
. . . I have learned that the 
hard, competitive world which 
I shall face after graduation 
is nothing but an enlarged 
version of the situation I have 
already encountered and 
learned to cope with at col
lege ... I will simply con
tinue to treat every situation 
as one in which only the fit
test will survive.
On Religion: . . . the only re
ligion that really appeals to 
me is one that has been 
called the GI religion. You 
simply walk into a dark room, 
sit, stand, or kneelas you 
prefer, and worship your own 
God (or whatever you choose 
to call Him) ... Yet I some
times wish that I could have 
faith in a . imple, standard 
religion.
. . . I find it difficult to con
ceive of an omnipotent, all
good, fatherlike diety. Such a 
diety wouldnt permit the pain 
and suffering that exists ... I 
prefer to believe in no god at 
all rather than in this kind of 
god. .
. . . God, I think, must be a 
pretty nice guy ... In spite of 
man and whatever he did, God 
continued to shower blessing 
on the beings he had created. 
On Marriage: . . . the most 
important decision of my life 
will be my choice of a wife. 
To develop his full capabili
ties a man must have a wife 
with a similar outlook on life, 
similar interests and, above 
all, similar aspirations.
. . . marriage is a mutual 
project in which the husband 
and his wife form a team 
working together for success 
. . . Im going to insist that 
when I do take a wife she be 
strictly a career woman . . . 
I dont want a family. I want 
freedom. I want to be able to 
take the calculated nsks to 
get ahead quickly . . . What I 
have to do is find a girl who 
is compatible and either 
doesnt want children or, better 
still, is unable to have them. 
On Careers: . . . I shall prob
ably end up by going into 
business or law. What I know 
for certain is that the voca
tion I finally end up in will 
be one where I am my own 
boss ... I would feel most 
challenged and could use my 
philosophy of getting ahead in 
the world with the least pos
sible outside interference.
. . . I never want to live 
the vacant life that would 
permit, would glorify that 
total commitment to the job 
which seems to be a precon
dition for sucess in commerce 
as well as in the military. 
 . . What I personally desire 
above all else is a life which 
will be creative, which will 
leave behind it some perma
nent and positive result in 
surrounding lives. The voca
tion, which, after much doubt 
and soul-searching, I have 
chosen to enable me to 
achieve this goal in life is that 
of teaching.
. . . If I go into science I 
know that Ill never be lack
ing a comfortable living, but 
I also know that I will never 
have a great deal of wealth 
... I think I have two con
flicting goals in lifeachieve
ment and security ... I think 
Im ambitious in that I want 
respect for the work that I do 
. . But Im a coward when 
it comes to taking a chance 
. . . What I want is a stable 
order of things in which I can 
work without exposing myself 
to ruin.

'GETTING TO KNOW YOU
STEfH
Editorial
Rushees Required Reading
The third week of February. About this time each year 
the fraternities and sororities are in the midst of spring rush. 
It is an exciting time for them, especially the sororities, and 
it is an exciting, but confusing time for the freshmen.
Two monumental problems seem to loom up in front of 
each freshmen. First, the question Do I want to be a Greek 
or a GDI (at least for another semester) ? The rushee should 
answer this question on the basis of his own needs and abili
ties. There are advantages and disadvantages in both courses 
of action depending upon the individual. In fairness to the 
Greeks and to oneself, a few questions common to all should 
be answered before one can answer the main question
1.) Do I have the finances? Find out approximately how 
many expenses there will be besides the basic dues and intiation fee. Here at Tech extra assessments are at a minimum in 
comparison to other colleges. Nevertheless, lack of funds will 
cause both the new initiate and the fraternity or sorority a 
great deal of anxiety which could have been avoided by a 
careful study of finances before pledging
2.) Will my education suffer? The rushee should deter
mine how much of his time and effort will be demanded by 
the Greeks and weigh it against the amount of time and ef

Greek to have an inactive active in their midst and it is un
fortunate for the new initiates, or super pledge, to have to 
miss sorority or fraternity activities. The majority of Greeks 
do emphasize scholarship as well as fraternity spirit. Usually 
the sorority average is above the all-school average.

In April the Carnegie Technical 
is planning to devote the entire 
issue to a survey of secondary 
school education with the empha
sis on the preparation for further 
training in science.
Among the articles planned for 
the fifth annual theme issue are 
those covering the topics of com
parative educational systems, aims 
and philosophy of education, new 
techniques in teaching, changing 
demands and requirements of col
leges, and very likely a few act
ual case studies of high schools 
represented at Carnegie Tech.
Freshmen Encouraged
Since plans are not yet com
pleted for this particular issue of 
the magazine, a meeting will be 
held in the Technical office on 
Thursday evening, February 20 at 
8:30 p.m. All interested persons 
are encouraged to come to find 
out more details about the issue. 
The freshmen should be especially 
interested since (1) they have so 
reecntly left their high school 
careers behind and (2) they were 
required to write one of their four 
final papers in freshmen composi
tion on the qualifications of their 
particular high schools.
This is one chance when stu
dents  those who should be most 
concerned with contemporary 
educational problems  will be 
able to speak out and give their 
opinions amidst the oft-distorted 
view's of the adult population.
Those already consenting to 
contribute papers are Mike Clay
ton, junior metallurgist; Carl 
Arendt, senior physicist, and Ed 
Blum, freshman chemical en
gineer.
Teclrs Honor aries 
Remain Active; 
Serve Campus
Despite the controversy con
cerning the role of activities honoraries and the assumption of 
many of their previous fuctions 
by Student Congress, most of the 
honoraries have continued to per
form recognized duties in campus 
affairs. Some of the groups have 
extended their activities to new 
fields.
The Omicron Delta Kappa chap
ter, senior mens honorary, has 
embarked on a new undertaking 
this year. Since the ODKs are 
chosen on the basis of their grades 
and activities, they have had a 
good deal of experience in lead
ership by their senior year. The 
members of this honorary are ex
tremely active on campus and 
hold high offices in many Tech 
organizations.
Consequently, the members felt 
that they could benefit Carnegie 
Tech most by trying to clear up 
existing problems through discus
sion than they could aid by par
ticipating in new endeavors which 
would take time from their pre
sent leadership positions. Mortar 
Board members were also invited 
to take part in the evaluations.
Evaluations Transmitted
Solutions formulated are carri
ed back to campus organizations 
through ODK and Mortar Board 
members. If there is no ODK or 
Mortar Board membership in the 
group to which the suggestions are 
to be offered, the group is con
tacted and the officers given the 
responsibility of putting the new 
plans into effect. Of course, this 
problem solving does not cover 
all of ODKs work, but it is taking 
up the bulk of their time this year.
The senior womens honorary, 
Mortar Board, has made its most 
recent project the publication of 
the Cultural Calendar. Listing the 
many concerts, exhibitions, and 
lectures both on campus and in 
the Oakland vicinity, the Calen
dar appeared first in January. The 
second issue is scheduled for pub
lication next week. (The Tartan 
lists in more detail current infor
mation on these programs each 
week in its Cultural Calendar.)

Observations
Needed: A World Safe 
From Wars Ravages
By Richard Block
This is the first in what I hope will be a series 
of columns dealing with national and world affairs, 
particularly those which would be of great interest 
and value to Tech students. It took a letter from an 
Indian friend (the letter was printed in part last 
week in Letters to the Editor) to awaken the real
ization of the need of such a column. My main 
purpose in this column is not to tell anyone what 
to think but, rather, to provoke everyone to think; 
to think about the world into which all of us will 
soon emerge.
In this first article I am going to remain silent 
and let you read the words of a top level military 
and public figure, General Omar N. Bradley. This 
great soldier who led the First Army in the attack 
on the Normandy beaches is also the first big 
American to launch an attack on the real challenge 
of Sputnik. We reprint the plea he made at the 
St. Albans School convocation in Washington on 
November 5, 1957. We believe these wise words de
serve widest attention.
General Bradley's Comments
The central problem of our time, as I view 
it, is how to employ human intelligence for the 
salvation of mankind. It is a problem we have put 
upon ourselves. For we have defined our intellect 
by the creation of such scientific instruments of 
destruction that we are now in desperate danger 
of destroying ourselves. Our plight is critical and 
with each effort we have made to relieve it by 
further scientific advance, we have succeeded only 
in aggravating our peril.
As a result, we are now speeding inexorably to
ward a day when even the ingenuity of our sci 
entists may be unable to save us from the con
sequences of a single rash act or a lone reckless 
hand upon the switch of an uninterceptable missile.
For twelve years now weve sought to stave off this 
ultimate threat of disaster by devising arms which 
would be both ultimate and disastrous.
Electronic House of Cards
This irony can probably be compounded a few 
more years, or perhaps even a few decades. Mis
siles will bring anti-missiles, and anti-missiles will 
bring anti-anti-missiles. But inevitably, this whole

Records Fall As Tartan Cagers 
Annihilate Indiana STC, 108-103
The Tartans put themselves above the 500 mark by beating In-# 
diana STC 108-103 last Tuesday night in a record smashing contest 
that left some 1000 spectators completely hoarse. Indiana had come 
into the game with a 15-1 record and with their 18 point lead in the 
fi ot half it seemed that they would leave with another victory. How
ever, early in the second half the#----------------------------------------------
Tartans switched to a zone de
fense which held Indiana to 6 
points while the Skibos rolled up 
16.
Tide Turns
The tide turned when Indiana 
led 70-54. At that point Sofia and 
Goetz poured in points from all 
over to tie it up at 80 all with a 
'ti. ute and a half remaining. In 
the closing seconds of regulation 
time the Skibos still trailed 87-85 
when Soffas driving lay-up knot
ted the score again. Soffa missed 
the chance for a three point play 
and an immediate Tech win when 
he missed the pressured foul 
shot.
Two Overtimes
The Tartans trailed throughout 
most of the first extra period and 
v. .e behind 98-95 in the final few 
seconds. Things looked dim for 
the plaids, but then Tucci put in 
a driving hook shot and surpris
ingly was fouled. He made the 
free throw which knotched the 
score again 98-98. The Tartans
CIT vs ISTC
Zone defense wins for Tech 
* * *
pulled away fast in the second 
overtime with Tucci and Rupert 
scoring and held this lead to win 
108-103.
New Records
Freshman Bill Soffa established 
a new Tech individual scoring re
cord with his 43 points. He broke 
former star A1 Franks record of 
42 points set last year in beating 
Thiel. This match also set a new 
high for Skibos points in one 
game. The previous record was 
100. In addition to Soffas 43 
points, other high scorers were 
Komer with 16, Tucci with 13 and 
Goetz 12.
Tartans Win 
Sixth Straight
Techs basketball team took an 
early lead and went on to stave 
off a last period Bucknell rally to 
defeat the Bucknell cagers 61-50.
The triumph came about mainly 
because Bucknell couldnt break 
through the Tartans zone defense 
until Tech piled up a 36-32 lead at 
the half. The Bucknell backcourt 
men couldnt hit from the ouside 
and this led to their downfall.
Bucknell was aided by a height 
advantage, but couldnt put their 
rebounds back in. Meanwhile
Tech gradually built up their im
pressive lead with some excellent 
driving and shooting by freshman 
star Bill Soffa.
Coach Mai Cratsley finally took 
out his entire first five and let 
them watch the proceedings from 
the bench until Bucknell came to 
within one point, 46-45 with five 
minutes to play.
At that time the regulars went 
back into action and gradually 
pulled away for the win. Bill Soffa 
again led Tech scorers With 22 
points while John Tucci came up 
with 15 and Bud Miller hit the 
hoops for eleven.
The victory was the sixth 
straight for the reborn Tartans 
and gives the team an excellent 
chance for finishing over the 500 
mark for the first time in three 
years. Their record now stands at 
10-8.

Techs swimming team won the 
first championship of the newly 
formed West Penn Conference by 
defeating Grove City College 
51-36.
Swimming in their own pool, 
Grove City was up for the meet 
and put on a tremendous show of 
strength, but were unable to over
come the Tartans. Grove City 
opened the meet with a two yard 
victory in the medley relay. Pat 
Cecine and Bob Shuck quickly 
eliminated Grove Citys lead as 
they placed one-two in the 220 
yard freestyle. Captain Mike Litch 
took first in the 50 yard freestyle 
before Abby Davie and Hal Partrick took the top two spots in 
the diving competition.
Outstanding Performance
The outstanding performance of 
the day followed in the* 200 yard 
butterfly as Grove Citys Ubbo 
Vandervolk won the event in 
2;30.3, a new pool and team rec
ord. Ubbo came back three events 
later to win the 200 yard breast
stroke.
Following the 100 yard freestyle 
in which the Tartans took a sec
ond and a third, Frank Shuck 
easily won the 200 yard back
stroke. Again Techs strength 
shown in the distance freestyle as 
Ross Engleman and Bob Shuck 
took one-two in the 440 yard free
style. The meet ended with a Tar
tan victory in the freestyle relay.
One of the Tartans outstanding 
performers was Frank Shuck, a 
senior chemical engineer from 
Clairton. Frank has been a tre
mendous asset to the team the last 
four years and has already gained 
five first places this season.

The basketball season is less 
than half over and already three 
unofficial intramural records have 
been shattered. The Englishmen, 
a powerful aggregation playing in 
the Scot League, rolled up 109 
points in smashing the Gunners 
109-17 a few nights ago. They 
scored a record 44 points in the 
fourth quarter and were led by 
Jack Mehalco who scored 47 
points. The hapless Gunners had 
even less luck scoring in their 
other league game against the 
powerful Grad Iggles who held 
them to an unofficial low record 
in beating them 40 to 7.
In the Skibo League, TKN chal
lenging last years runners up 
ATO A, for the title, are aver
aging better than 77 points per 
game, having defeated Phi Kappa 
C 77-13 and Newman Club 78-30. 
The ASCE SRS in the Tartan 
League, however, have compiled 
an even more fantastic average of 
over 82 points per game. Not far 
behind in the scoring column are
the champion Rockets of last year, 
who are averaging 70 points per 
game with 74-19 victories over 
Clyde Street AC and 67-19 win 
over Sigma Nu A.
In the personal scoring column, 
Jack Mehalco of the Englishmen 
leads with his high game of 47. 
Boyd Doxtader of the Rockets 
holds the next highest with 32 
points against the Clyde St. AC. 
Other players averaging over 20 
points or better are Jim Muth 
TKN, Paul Sucevic of ASCE, John 
Ralston of ASCE and Robert Rapp 
of the Grads.
IM Basketball will be going full 
tilt for the rest of this week and 
all of next week on every school 
night. The next week or two 
should see the various leagues 
break wide open, and the victors 
come to the top. As of now six
teen teams are undefeated, and 
any one of them could become the 
Campus Champion.

to join a sorority of fraternity the 
next question is Which one?- By 
this second semester the freshman 
has had an opportunity to meet 
members of all groups, but the 
rush period^ is important because 
this is the time when one can 
meet all the actives and can see 
them as a group.
Perhaps the major criteria in 
choosing a particular fraternity or 
sorority is that you should enjoy 
being with the sophomores and 
juniors as well as those persons 
in your class. All the Greeks on 
Techs campus are national, thus 
the need of choosing on the basis 
of national reputation is partially 
eliminated. What they are like 
here is the important thing.
Naturally you would like to 
pledge the same fraternity that 
your friends pledge, but as was 
mentioned before, one of the rea
sons for joining a sorority or 
fraternity is to make new friends. 
You dont lose old friends, as is 
evidenced by the close friend
ships among the Greeks. In addi
tion it is impossible for a soror
ity because of quotas, to bid ali 
the members of your friendship 
circle. You should pledge a group 
whose present members you en
joy. If you really like these, you 
should then feel that you will like 
the majority of the persons they 
choose to be in your pledge class; 
that you will all have something 
in common.
In choosing, sometimes it will 
be difficult to decide which one 
group is for you  you would be 
happy in several. For this reason, 
as well as to assure that eacn 
sorority gets a class, the fusnees 
are given a preferential ballot on 
which they may list three c loices. 
This is also a safeguard for the 
rushee  she is almost always 
assured of a bid.
If these questions are answered 
then the confusion on the part of 
the freshman will be somewhat 
lessened. But it is up to the in
dividual to answer the questions 
himself.

electronic house of cards will 
reach a point where it can be con
structed no higher.
At that point we shall have 
come to the peak of this whole 
incredible dilemma into which the 
world is shoving itself. And when 
that time comes there will be lit
tle we can do other than to settle 
down uneasily, smother our fears, 
and attempt to live in a thicken
ing shadow of death.
Hitler and Reason
Should this situation come to 
pass, we would have but one sin
gle and thin thread to cling to. 
We call it rational or reason. We 
reason that no government, no 
single group of menindeed, not 
even one willful individual 
would be so foolhardy, so reck
less, as to participate a war which 
would most surely end in mutual
destruction.
This reasoning many have the 
benefit of logic. But even logic 
sometimes goes awry. How can 
we assume that reason will pre
vail in a crisis when there is or
dinarily so little reason among 
men. To those who would take 
comfort in the likelihood of ana
tomic peace to be secured solely 
by rational and reason, I would 
recall the lapse of reason in a 
bunker under the Reich Chancel
lery in Berlin. It failed before it 
can fail again.
Have we already gone too far in 
this search for peace through the 
accumulation of peril? Is there 
any way to halt this trendor 
must we push on with new devices 
until we inevitably come to judg
ment before the atom, I believe 
there is a way out. And I believe 
it because I have acquired in my 
lifetime a decent respect for hu
man intelligence.

John Lawlor, B.S. in E.E., Brown, '52, answers some questions about
An engineering career with the Bell Telephone Companies
John Lawlor is a Transmission Engineer with New 
England Telephone and Telegraph Company in 
Boston. His answers reflect his experiences during 
five years in the telephone business.
Q
A
How did you begin as an engineer 
in the Bell Telephone Companies?
My first fifteen months were spent in on-thejob trainingchanging assignments every three 
months or so. These assignments gave me a 
broad, over-all background in telephone engi
neering. And they were accompanied by plenty 
of responsibility. They progressed in importance 
with my ability to handle them.
What is the attitude of older engineers 
and supervisors toward young men?
Ive found a strong team spirit in the telephone 
company. Youre encouraged to contribute your 
ideas, and theyre received with an open mind. 
Young men and new ideas are regarded as vital 
to the continuing growth of the company.
Q How about opportunities for advancement?
Id say they depend on the man. Opportunities 
to demonstrate your ability come with each new

job youre given. The size and importance of 
your assignments grow with your ability to handle 
them. All promotions are made from within, and 
the growth of the business is creating new open
ings all the time. One more thing. Most tele
phone engineering locations are convenient to 
colleges. You can aid your advancement by keep
ing on with your studies.
How does the telephone company 
stack up where pay is concerned?
Starting salaries are competitive with those of
fered by most large companies. Raises are based 
on merit, with several increases during your first 
two years with the company. Whats more, your 
performance is reviewed regularly to make sure 
that your pay keeps up with your progress. All 
things considered, I think a Bell Telephone career 
is second to none in rewards and opportunities.

accommodation in a world split by 
rival ideologies are more difficult 
than those with which we have 
struggled in the construction of 
ballistics missiles. But I believe, 
too, that if we apply to these hu
man problems, the energy, cre
ativity, and the perseverance we 
have devoted to science, even 
problems of accommodation will 
yield to reason. Admittedly, 
problem of peaceful accommoda
tion in the world is infinitely more 
difficult than the conquest of 
space, infinitely more complex 
than a trip to the moon.
But if we will only come to the 
realization that it must be worked 
outwhatever it may mean even 
to such sacred traditions as abso
lute national sovereigntyI be
lieve that we can somehow, some
where, and perhaps through so* ? 
as yet undiscovered world thinker 
and leader find a workable solu
tion.
The Faith We Need
I confess that this is as much 
an article of faith as it is an ex
pression of reason. But this, my 
friends, is what we need, faith in 
our ability to do what must be 
done. Without that faith we shali 
never get started. And until w<* 
get started, we shall never kno..^ 
what can be done.
If I am sometimes discouraged, 
it is not by the magnitude of the 
problem, but by our colossal in
difference to it. I am unable to 
understand whyif we are will
ing to trust in reason as a re
straint on the use of a ready-made 
ready-to-fire bombwe do not 
make greater, more diligent and 
more imaginative use of reason 
and human intelligence in seekii. J 
an accord and compromise which 
will make it possible for mankind 
to control the atom and banish it 
is an instrument of war.
This is the real andindeed 
the most strenuous challenge to 
mans intellect" today. By com
parison with it, the conquest of 
space is of small significance. For 
until we learn how to live to
gether, upntil we rid ourselves of 
the strife that mocks our prete. > 
sions of civilization, our adven
tures in scienceintsead of pro
ducing human progresswill con
tinue to crowd it with greater 
peril.
Satellite On Which We Live
We can compete with a Sputnik 
and probably create bigger and 
better Sputniks of our own. But 
what are we doing to prevent the 
Sputnik from evolving into just 
one more weapon system? Ai.^ 
when we are going to muster art 
intelligence sequal to that applied 
against the Sputnik and dedicate 
it to the preservation this Satellite 
on which we live? How longI 
would ask youcan we put off 
salvation? When does humanity 
run out?
If enough of us believe strongly 
enough in the ability of intelligent 
human beings to get together on 
some basis of a just accord, v. ' 
might somehow, somewhere, in 
some way and under some auspices 
make a start on it.
Time Against Us
Unless we soon get started, it 
may be too late. We cant sit about 
waiting for some felicitious acci
dent of history that may some
how make the world all right. 
Time is running against us, and it 
is running against us with tb' 
speed of a Sputnik.
If were going to save ourselves 
from the instruments of our own 
intellect, we had better soon get 
ourselves under control and begin 
making the world safe for living.
This speech was delivered on 
November 5. Since that date we 
have put a Sputpik in the sky. 
Time is still running.
