The climax of the double anniver
sary, Carnegies eightieth birthday 
and Techs fifteenth, was the immense 
gathering which filled Carnegie Music 
Hall to capacity at the exercises last 
Wednesday morning, November 24, 
at 11 oclock. In the afternoon, a per
formance of Tartuffe in the Design 
School Theatre ended the season of 
celebration begun early in the week.
On Tuesday morning, automobiles 
for inspecting the city and locality 
were provined for the hundred odd 
special guests of the Institute, many 
of whom the school entertained at 
Hotel Schenley. Royal treatment was 
accorded our distinguished visitors 
from the time they were met at the 
train and provided with Plaid arm
bands and commemorative medals, of 
which those given the students were 
miniatures, until they said goodbye to 
Pittsburgh at the conclusion of the 
exercises.
Tuesday afternoons program in
cluded a big reception for the guests 
and out-of-town friends of the Insti
tute, followed by an inspection of the 
school under the guidance of the fac
ulty. Regular classes gave way to 
special laboratories, so that the most 
spectacular and interesting parts of 
the regular courses were all on show 
for the inspecting groups. Tuesday 
evening a magnificent dinner was pro
vided for the special guests, and then

ent of the Chicago public schools,

Y. M. C. A. MEETING!
(ROSS TRY JOHN BRASHEAR EINE OUTLOOK FOR 
(EOSES SEASON MASQUE AND DINNER BASKETBALL TEAM
The Cross Country team closed a 
most successful season by defeating 
Wooster University in a dual meet 
last Saturday.
Directly following the meet Coach 
Dull gave a short speech in which 
he thanked the team for the respect, 
courtesy and earnest work which they 
had displayed at all times, and com
mended Captain Rieser on his ability 
in guiding the team through so suc
cessful a season.
Captain Rieser, in a few words, as
sured the team it had been a pleasure 
to act as their captain. He thanked 
the team for their never-tiring co
operation with him in all that had 
been attempted.
A. J. Walker, of Pittsburgh, Pa., 
was elected captain for the 1916 sea
son by the unanimous vote of the 
seven men who were eligible to vote, 
on account of winning the varsity in
signia. Walker is a Sophomore in 
the School of Applied Science, hav
ing come from Allegheny High 
School two years ago. His splendid 
showing in the P. A. A. as well as 
Wooster meet, together with his rec
ords of last year, fully justifies the 
team in their action.
The following men will receive their 
letters: Rieser, Dockstader, Moore,
Walker, Andrews, Lawson, and De 
Young.
THAT THANKSGIVING DINNER.
A meeting of the Y. M. C. A. was 
held last Sunday afternoon in Room 
104 of the School of Applied Indus
tries. Owing to the fact that many 
of the fellows were away over the 
Thanksgiving holidays, the attend
ance was small. Most of the time 
was spent in discussion, pertaining to 
basis of membership, etc.
Next Sunday afternoon, Rev. Jas.
E. Norcross, pastor of the Shady 
Avenue Baptist Church, will address 
the meeting. His subject will be: 
How Grandpa Came Back and is 
sure to be most interesting. All who 
can are urged to come out. The meet
ing will begin at 3:00 P. M.

About one oclock on Thanksgiving 
afternoon, nearly one hundred hungry

partake of one of the finest feeds ever 
seen within the bounds of Schenley. 
For several hours beforehand one

student force worked hard under the

Pitt and Tech joined hands 
with Pittsburgh last Wednesday even
ing to pay tribute to Dr. John Brashear, Pennsylvanias grand old man. 
The reception and banquet in Me
morial Hall was attended by almost 
eight hundred people. After the ban
quet the Star Masque, written by 
a Design student, Miss Littic, and 
directed by Mr. Stevens, was present
ed very successfully by Night Dra
matic students, and assisted by six 
girls who danced star dance.3 directed 
by Miss Stoner. Mr. Baird, a Pitt 
man wrote the poem dedicated to Dr. 
Brashear, which well expressed the 
feelings of Pittsburgh people toward 
their Uncle John. After Dr. Brash
ear had gathered an armful of Ameri
can beauties, seventy-five in honor of 
his seventy-fifth birtnday, given him 
by the Phoebe Brashear girls, he 
said: I think that the rose is the
most beautiful thing God ever created 
without giving it a soul. Then he 
spoke about the different letters of 
congratulation that he had received 
and he spoke specially of the ones 
from the little blind children. He 
said: All that I have ever done, no
matter how humble, has come back 
to me a hundred-fold. I am so happy 
here it would be a wonderful place to 
go to heaven from.
Dr. Brashear attributed his success 
to many dear friends and very much 
to his wife, but all Pittsburgh knows 
that the secret of his success is, that 
he has become known as the dear, 
smiling old man, helping somebody. 
Quoting his own words: I ought to 
feel very conceited after an ovation 
like this but it seems to me the Lord

FOOTBALL SQUAD SEE 
FOLLIES.
Excellent Schedule Arranged.
That Tech appreciates her team was 
shown by the theater party tendered 
them at the Nixon Monday. With 
the exception of Cupid Young, who 
rivals John Bunny, everybody had 
little difficulty in retaining their seats. 
After the show was over the party 
filled up on hot cakes, ice cream 
and pie.
It would be impossible for the squad 
to thank each individual who so kind
ly purchased a Get Pitt tag in or
der to defray the expense of the 
party. Therefore the squad wishes 
to take this opportunity of thanking 
the student body and assure them a 
more enjoyable party has never been 
held.
With four varsity letter men to start 
with, we should be able to develop 
a team this year that will make a 
splendid showing against the formid
able opponents that have been placed 
on our schedule. Captain Hines, 
Henning and Meredith remain from 
last season, and will show a propor
tion to increase in ability as a result 
of last years training and experience. 
Captain-elect for the season, Tumpane, has returned to school after his 
absence of last season, caused by an 
injury received in an inter-department 
football embroglio. With these four 
as a nucleus, and added to this, the 
splendid new material, the excellent 
record of the gridiron warriors will, 
in all probability, be duplicated. So 
good is the new material that every 
letter man will have to dispute very 
actively with the candidates to retain 
his position on the Varsity Five.
Slater and Green, last years for
wards on the Freshman five, are out 
for a lower berth this time and have 
excellent chances of obtaining varsity 
positions. Holzworth and Craig are 
out for center and are making it a 
most interesting competition.
Black, Fletcher, and Kelly are good 
fighters on the guards and are out 
for blood. Sacks is an all around 
player with speed and grit, and has 
proven himself a very useful man.
Of the new men we have not tried 
Alvans and Robertson, two splendid 
forwards, good shots and experi
enced men that are a welcome addi
tion. Findlay was found on the floor 
last practice and we all know his 
good points that make him a formid
able contender for the five.
There are several other splendid 
players, but we know them by their 
ability and not by name. An effort 
will be made to find out this rather 
minor feature and will tell you more 
of them in the next issue.
In the schedule you will find our 
old contenders, Pitt, Westinghouse, 
Allegheny, Grove City and other well 
known adversaries. But notice that 
Cornell, University of Buffalo, and 
Colgate have been added as another 
opportunity for prestige for the old
BIBLICUS MODERNICUS.
Consider the football hero on the 
field: He grinds not, neither does he 
pass, yet Solomon, in all his glory 
was not hurrayed as one of these.

PITTSBURGH PA., DEC. 1, 1915
FOUNDERS DAY.
The fifteenth anniversary of the 
founding of our school and the eigh
tieth birthday of our founder brought 
forth a number of notable visitors. 
Tech has not seen as many such per
sonages at any one time during her 
history. Our school and its organi
zation made, without a doubt, a won
derful impression on all. They had 
not expected to see as great an insti
tution as confronted them when they 
entered Schenley Park. Our wonder
ful strides in fifteen years of founda
tion could hardly be conceived by 
many of our guests of the past week.
Almost every university, collcge, 
technical school and society were rep
resented among those present to the 
celebration. Ella Flagg Young, Chi
cago superintendent of public schools, 
Edward Robinson, head of Metropoli
tan Museum of Art in New York, and 
Dr. Henry S. Pritchet, president of 
the Carnegie Foundation and many 
delegates from scientific societies 
were here. Uncle John Brashear 
and Charles M. Schwab were promi
nent figures also in our celebration.
It is hoped by all those connected 
writh our school and institute that 
such a number of notables shall come 
again to visit us. We are glad to 
have them, to show what our institu
tion can do for the upbuilding of hu
manity. We were disappointed not 
to have our founder with us. Mr. 
Pritchett said in his address Wednes
day morning:
I bring you first of all a word of 
greeting from Mr. Carnegie himself. 
He has returned to New York after 
the summer rest, full of his old-time 
spirit. It was his wish to be with 
you today, but for the first time in his 
life, he finds himself obliged to accept 
the doctors commands, and to give 
himself less generously than has been 
his wont to these annual gatherings. 
By a proxy, therefore, he sends his 
affectionate greetings and good wishDOUBLE ANNIVERSARY
Continued from Page 1 
New York, and Charles F. Howe, 
Cases president, addressed a crowd 
in the Institute auditorium.
The big address of the Wednesday 
morning exercises by Dr. Henry Prit
chett, president of the Carnegie 
Foundation for Education, was lis
tened to by practically the entire stu
dent body; and since Director Hamerschlag is having it printed for distri
bution to all desirous of obtaining it, 
let it suffice to say that it dealt with 
the immense scope and value to man
kind of Andrew Carnegies six im
mense philanthropies, to which, the 
speaker declared, Mr. Carnegie has 
given away the bulk of his $400,000,-
000, so that now he is a man of only 
moderate wealth.
Too much praise can not be given 
the choral club and symphony orches
tra, for these two student organiza
tions gave a musical program which 
it is very doubtful could be equalled 
by any other school in the country. 
The audience demanded the first num
ber, Haendels Messiah,Hallelu
jah chorus, twice, and sustained ap
plause followed each division of the 
orchestras suite from Carmen long 
before it was finished. The hundred 
odd students who made the music 
were grouped on the big stage of the 
music hall just behind the row of 
notables, among whom the students 
picked out Judge Buffington, Uncle 
John Brashear, Charles M. Schwab, 
Dr. Pritchett, and the Director.
To say that over two thousand stu
dents took part in the endless line 
which reached double breasted from 
the Music Hall steps to the Indus
tries entrance would be to put it 
mildly. The full strength of the 1600 
Day students were there, and many 
of the Night men too. The proces
sion was headed by the faculty, then 
the band, with next in succession, 
Margaret Morrison, Design, Science, 
and Industries. Industries aired an 
immense green banner, but the Sci
ence Plebes one even exceeded this 
in size, for it took a whole section 
to carry it. Back along the line many 
groups, not being able to hear the 
band, made their own music, so that 
quite a variety of songs, new and old, 
were aired. During the distribution 
of the commemorative medals Dear 
Old Tech nearly took the high roof 
off the Music Hall foyer, but the con
cluding Alma Mater represented the
high tide of student singing at Tech.

THAT THANKSGIVING DINNER
Continued from Page 1 
paring for the feast and when the 
guests arrived all was ready.
The dinner was served in five 
courses in true Waldorf style and 
lasted about an hour. The food was 
so good and there was such a large 
quantity of it that no one had much 
room for the generous slice of pump
kin pie which comprised the final 
course. That pie, in delicacy and rich' 
ness of flavor and in cross-section 
crowded the one mother used to 
make.
At the end of the feast, each man 
drew a numbered card from a hat the 
holders of certain lucky numbers be
ing entitled to a ticket to the Davis 
Theatre that night.
Lusty cheers were given for Miss 
Lucas, Dr. Esquerre, the waiters and 
the Beanery. A committee was ap
pointed to convey the thanks of the 
men to Director Hamerschlag for the 
fine dinner the school had given them. 
The committee is composed of J. 
Guter, Science, R. Bost, Design, and 
W. Carson, Industries.
The labor and care required in pre
paring a dinner of this kind is tre
mendous and much consideration is 
due Miss Lucas and Dr. Esquerre for 
their hard work. They were willing 
to sacrifice their Thanksgiving in or
der that the boys might not feel too 
keenly their absence from mothers 
table on this day of all days.
On Thanksgiving evening, eighty 
loyal Tech men, holders of the lucky 
numbers above mentioned, assembled 
at the Davis Theater for the evenings 
entertainment. Can you imagine the 
joyfulness of such a well-fed crowd 
with nothing on their minds but their 
hair and not even a thing to do on 
the morrow? The show was good and 
the usual Tech spirit and pep was in 
evidence between acts.
About ten-thirty each wended his 
way homeward,, confident that, thanks 
to the school, he had spent a day well 
worth remembering.
Colby students recently started a 
riot by attempting to remove Uni
versity of Maine banners from the 
side of the U. of M. special while it 
stopped a minute in Waterville.

JOHN BRASHEAR DINNER
Continued from Page 1 
must have destroyed my bump of selfconceit whn I was born.
Of the privileged eight hundred that 
dined in splendor at Memorial Hall 
at $2 per, none enjoyed themselves 
more than the select thirty Tech 
students who also dined, not in splen
dor but on good old Pittsburgh, in a 
private room of the Schenk}' the same 
evening.
SYSTEM.
Could you give a pretty definite 
synopsis of each course that you have 
taken in the University If you can, 
your time has been well spent no 
matter whether you made As or Ds 
as you went along.
A great many students make the 
very bad mistake of taking too much 
pains with details ana too little with 
a general view of the field of the 
course. They cannot carry the whole 
course in their heads during the 
whole term, so they wait until the 
last week and cram details for the 
examination. It is a general impres
sion among students that such a stu
dent is a sinner for having failed to 
have kept his head crammed during 
the whole term. Whoever believes 
such is afflicted with an over tender 
conscious upon this point. There are 
not many such points in creation, but 
this certainly is one of them.
There is a student in the Univer
sity who keeps a small card cata
logue for every course. At the end 
of each days lecture, he writes down 
upon one card the salient points of 
that lecture. Thus at the end of the 
term, each course is laid before him 
upon less than thirty small cards. He 
has been in the University several 
years and he makes good grades, it 
is very seldom that the cards fail 
to answer every question asked upon 
a final examination. But the odd 
thing about it all is this: this same 
student has a feeling in his heart that 
he is doing something sinfulthat it 
would be a bad idea to let his in
structors get hold of his scheme. As 
a matter of fact, he is following some 
of the best rules of pedagogy and 
is doing exactly what his instructors 
are praying that he will do.
But you say, Why that is not so 
easy, it takes judgment to make out 
such a card catalogue. That is just 
the point; you should use your judg
ment more and your memory less, in 
other words use system.
Do you think this is a poor time 
of the year to give the advice given 
above? Yes, for immediate pur
poses it is, but we thought that giv
ing it now when it appeals the most, 
would cause it to make a deeper im
pression on your brain.Daily Texan.

SELF GOVERNMENT AT THE 
DORMITORIES.
Editors Note:This article has been 
held over from previous issues ow
ing to lack of space.
It ha been known for some time 
that the Carnegie mens Dormitories 
were to be a self governing insti
tution. Whether this plan would be 
a success has been a much discussed 
question about the schools. There 
is no reason why it should not be a 
success. It seems perfectly reason
able that a group of men, such as are 
at the Dorms, should be capable of 
governing themselves.
With this end in view the Carne
gie Dormitories Association has 
been formed. This organization was 
originated entirely by the Dormitory 
men and has been approved by the 
school authorities. The work of the 
Organization Committee is to be 
commended, for the constitution as 
drawn up by them, was accepted 
with only a few minor changes. The 
form of government outlined in the 
constitution seems to be suited to 
the Dormitory problems, and with 
the support of the men should be a 
decided success.
The administrative body consists of 
eleven officers. These are the regu
lar officers of any organization and 
a regulation board. The officers for 
this school year are as follows:
Honorary ChairmanDr. Esquerre.
PresidentJ. Guter, A. S.
V. PresidentW. Ammerman, A.
D.
TreasurerH. Spencer, A. S.
SecretaryA. Einstein, A. S.
Regulation Board1L. Walker, A.
I., ' R. B. Holland, A. S., A. Schtz, 
A. I., L. Guthrie, A. S., C. Greiner, 
A. S.
The officers of the Association form 
the governing board, which is re
sponsible for the administration of 
the association. Of course these 
eleven men cannot by their own ef
forts make self government a suc
cess, but with their own earnest ef
forts and the support of the Dorm 
men, success is assured. Since the 
final adoption of the constitution the 
results have been exceedingly en
couraging.
The regulation board, mentioned 
above, consists of a man from each 
floor of the Dormitories who is in 
charge of the regulation and welfare 
of his particular floor, being directly 
responsible to the president. For 
their guidance a number of regula
tions of mutual benefit have been 
voted into the constitution by the 
men.
To aid in the administration of the 
complex body of men at the Dorms, 
president Guter has appointed the fol
lowing committees. House and Clubroom Committee with E. G. Mamilton as general chairman, and B. Battey and C. Andrews as the sub-chair
men from their respective dormitor
ies. This committee will give its at
tention to the general equipment at 
the Dormitories.
Scholastic Committee, with R. Boals 
as chairman. One of the gauges for 
measuring the success of the Dormi
tories will be scholastic standing of 
the men residing in them. Realizing 
this, a committee was apointed, for 
the purpose of maintaining a proper 
scholastic standing among the men. 
They will look into the standing of 
the residents of the Dorms, endeavor 
to help and encourage those men who 
are not making good. They will act 
as advisors to the Plebes, who are 
so often laboring under misunder
standings. Some of the instructors 
have signified a willingness to hold 
free tutoring classes at the Dorms on 
certain evenings, which will be of 
great help to men needing special 
attention. It is hoped that this will 
soon be arranged for. The commit
tee will try to make provision for a 
scholastic trophy to be competed for 
by the two Dorms.
Social Committee with W. Ammer
man as chairman. A certain amount 
of social life has a wholesome ef
fect, and this committee will en
deavor to provide the proper amount 
of social recreation for the men.
Athletic Committee with R. Mc
Cracken as chairman. It is intended 
to foster friendly athletic rivalry in 
the Dormitories. The committee will 
try to organize these activities prop
erly. The donation of an athletic 
trophy has already been assured.
With the above named committees 
and one or two more which are to 
be appointed soon, it is expected that 
proper attention will be given to the 
various Dormitory problems.
The school authorities, of course, 
are doing all in their power to make 
the Dorms a success, and every man 
in the Dorms has realized that Dr. 
Esquerre has and still is bending 
every effort in this direction.
The Dormitories are a most import
ant addition to the school, and are 
fostering a spirit hitherto unknown 
here. We expect them to be a suc
cess in the fullest sense of the word.
THE BEGINNING OF TECH.
Director Tells Inside Facts of Schools 
Foundation, His Part in Forming 
the Type of Institution.Oriof School Colors.
(EDITORS NOTE.This article has 
been held over from a previous issue, 
owing to lack of space.)
Last Wednesday the students of the 
School of Applied Science who were 
fortunate enough to obtain standing 
room in 209 Science, heard Director 
Hamerschlag tell about the ins and 
outs of how Tech came to be the 
school that it is.
In the beginning Mr. Carnegie of
fered the city of Pittsburgh a million 
dollars for the foundation of a Tech
nical Institution on condition that 
they obtain a tract of land suitable 
for extension. The money was as
sured, and the city provided thirtytwo acres of land adjoining Schenley 
Park and near the library building, so 
that the big thing was to determine 
what the character of the school 
should be.
An original committee of which 
William McConway, Dr. Brashear,
and Mr. Schwab were members, con
tained the best business and technical 
talent available. Mr. Schwab is now 
President of the Bethlehem Steel 
Company. This committee was called 
the committee on plan and scope. 
They attacked the problem in the 
same way as they would any import
ant business enterprise, calling in a 
number of experts on education, the 
best that the country afforded. Of 
these, a group containing such men as 
Professor Thurston, of Cornell; Pro
fessor Gray, of Rose Polytechnic In
stitute, and Professor Johnston, of the 
Washington University at St. Louis, 
were chosen to draw up a report con
taining their idea of what kind of an 
institution should be founded.
As usual, the report of these men 
reflected the opinion of one of their 
number very strongly,it was the 
ideas of Professor Thurston, of Cor
nell, who would have the new institu
tion a reproduction of Cornell with 
several departments above and below, 
so that in the words of the director, 
they would be courses from the kin
dergarten to the grave.
The plan was submitted to Mr. Car
negie, who was overwhelmed. He 
thought that it would be taking too 
long a mortgage on the life of any 
individual; he could not see how such 
an institution could all come under the 
administration of one school, so he 
told the members on Plan and Scope 
that if they would tear up the report, 
he would give them another million. 
This seemed a good business proposi
tion to the committee, so with the 
payment of a small honorarium,not 
a million dollars,they dismissed the 
drafters of the first report.
Now they had to start all over. 
There was a man in New York, Dr. 
A. A. Hamerschlag, who had been in
vited to serve on the first committee, 
but who through lack of sympathy 
with the ideas there represented per
haps, had declined to serve. So think
ing that there must be something dif
ferent, they offered this man the chair
manship of a new committee to draw 
up a plan for the technical institute 
Pittsburgh was to have. Our Director 
accepted, and chose as his associates 
one local man, C. B. Connelely, the 
present dean of A. I., and Professor 
Williston, of M. I. T.
For several weeks these men made 
as thorough and systematic a study of 
the conditions affecting the type of 
school needed as their ingenuity could 
devise. They visited labor employees, 
the neighboring colleges, and collect
ed data on the whole school system 
of this section. Then in order to 
eliminate the preponderance of one 
mans ideas, each of the men wrote a 
separate report.
But when they submitted it to the 
trustees, they struck an obstacle. 
Their two hundred and fifty pages of 
carefully prepared report was returned 
with the request that they condense 
it into one report of not over ten 
pages. This seemingly impossible 
task was finally accomplished, and 
this report the trustees read. They 
passed it on to Mr. Carnegie, and he 
said, Fine. He could read it in an 
hour!
The next step was to obtain an
NG Banquets

hotel business We have specialized 
in this busisess so long, and are so 
thoroughly equipped, you are sure of 
satisfaction.

The ranks of the first class' men were

they went out of the field of educators

imaginative brain had evolvedj the 
scheme. Since it was his plan, he 
could enter heart and soul into the 
work. Dr. Hamerschlag became the

Editors Note:This article has been 
held over from previous issues ow

The Tartan at all times solicits com

alumni or faculty of Tech. We do not 
however bear any responsibility for

School Elections.
Editor, The Tartan:
I wish to present the preferential 
system of voting to the readers of 
The Tartan in the hope that they will 
study it carefully, and that the class 
presidents will be sufficiently inter
ested in it to bring it up for discussion 
in their classes.
It is gradually winning favor in city 
and in college elections. The major
ity of cities that have adopted the 
commission form of government are 
electing their officials by this method 
of balloting. Case School of Applied 
Science has tested it thoroughly, and 
after two years use there, it has
proved its great superiority.
I would suggest the following elec
tion rules if this system by balloting 
were used here:
1. Nominations shall be made on 
a paper drawn up for such a purpose, 
and placed on the regular bulletin 
board one week before the election.
2. The election shall take place
one week after the posting of the
paper for the nominations. All names 
should be on paper 3 days after post
ing so that it can be taken down and 
the ballots mimeographed for the elec
tion.
3. The balloting shall be carried
on during a regular meeting of the
class. The time and the place of 
voting shall be announced at least one 
week before election.
4. The preferential system of bal
loting shall be used*in all class elec
tions wherever more than two candi
dates are nominated for any office. 
Each voter shall designate on the bal
lot his first^ second and third choices 
of candidates for the office. The 
counting of the ballots and thj?. de
termination of election shall be as 
follows:
In case one man has the majority
of the first choices he is elected. In 
case no one has a majority, the second 
choices are added to the first choices 
and the man then having the largest 
number, provided it be a majority of 
the ballots, is elected. If no such 
majority of the ballots is thus ob
tained, the third choices are added in 
and the candidate then having the 
largest number is elected.
5. No man can be nominated for 
more than one office at the same elec
tion.
6. A ballot prepared by the com
mittee, containing the names of all 
the candidates, either mimeographed 
or printed, shall be used.
7. The freshman class election 
shall take place one month after the 
opening of college.
In electing officers by the preferen
tial ballot, and counting the vote ac
cording to the election rules given 
above, four possible cases will arise. 
So that every reader may thoroughly 
understand just how this system 
works out, and to show its practicabil
ity, I give below four numerical ex
amples.
A class of 85 voted, making a ma
jority of 43 necessary for the election 
of a man.
Choices 12 3 4
Case 1 A 9 17 35
B 25 25 21
C 44 20 15 44*
D 7 23 14

D 9 8 14 31
E 12 15 13 40
F 14 6 21 41
G 11 13 15 39
Column four gives the count of the 
vote which elected the officer.
In Case 1, the first choice gives the 
majority to C, who is elected. In 
Case 2, the first and second choices 
must be added; A, B and C have a 
majority, but C has the biggest ma
jority and is elected. In Case 3, the 
first, second and third choices must 
be added; B, C, D, and E then have 
a majority, but B has the biggest and 
is elected. In Case 4, when all 
choices are added, there is no major
ity. In this case, A, the man with 
the highest number of votes is elect
ed.
I might add that there is no doubt 
that the school authorities, in the in
terest of better school elections, 
would be glad to mimeograph the 
ballots.
Respectfully yours,
Paul W. Emmel.

MEDIEVAL BALL REPEATED.
txpressed that this ball surpasses all 
similar functions previously given.
Given Before Large Number of 
Guests.
Last Tuesday evening the halls of 
the Design School rang once more 
with the joy and laughter of the Mid
dle Ages. And Charlemange, his 
court and guests again welcomed the 
return of his brave warriors from suc
cessful campaigns in Africa.
Before a large number of prominent 
guests the Design students repeated 
the masque and ball given on Novem
ber 11th. Special seating arrange
ments were made to provide for the 
guests, but these were by far insuffi
cient when compared with the num
ber of guests present. It was at first 
feared that it would be necessary to 
go through the performance twice, 
in order that all those present might 
view it. However, the crowd man
aged to squeeze themselves into the 
upper part of the foyer and the bal
cony.
The masque was given with much 
more success than at the first ball. 
The real success of this clever little 
tableau, however, must be credited to 
Howard B. Pearce and Pridgeon 
Smith, who conceived, and to Theo
dore A. Viehman and Howard F. 
Smith, who wrote it. For those who 
were not lucky enough to witness the 
masque, it might best be explained 
by the arrangement given in the in
vitation issued:
Charlemange, Emperor of the 
West, assembles his court to cele
brate the success of his armies 
against the Saracens in Africa. 
His Paladins arrive severally, 
fresh from their victories: Rinaldo, Ogier, Roland and other peers 
who represent the flower of Chris
tian Chivalry. They bring with 
them captives, magicians and 
converts. Bradamante, the brave 
maiden warrior, is knighted by 
Carlos Magnus with fitting cere
mony. Meanwhile, ambassadors 
arrive from the Pope, from By
zantium and Bagdad. Acuin, the 
scholar, alone guesses a riddle 
and receives much honor. The 
entire court then moves to ban
quet chamber and when the feast 
is ended ritual dances are per
formed.
To the artist who would enjoy the 
artistic effect of such an event it was 
probably most pleasing. In this re
spect the first ball was undoubtedly 
the most successful, as no one was 
present but who was in costume, giv
ing the impression of really living in 
the time represented, a thing which 
only the artists soul can best con
ceive.
The Ball on Tuesday night was 
open to all students in the Institute 
who wished to pay the assessment and 
come in costume. Immediately after 
the masque, two of Nirellas orches
tra made music both in the corridors 
and Exhibition room. The Ball broke 
up about 3 A. M. and many on leaving

it was further developed, and all that 
winter before the school opened was 
devoted to presenting the matter be
fore tens of thousands of people in 
this vicinity in the guise of free lec
tures. At these lectures more than 
five thousand names of boys and girls 
tyvere collected with the kind of a 
course they desired, and whether they 
wanted it day or night. The results 
were classified into four groups. Over 
two thousand of these, by far the larg
est group, wanted an engineering edu
cation; the next largest group wanted 
an industrial training; the third class 
were the girls who wanted special 
training in such subjects as dressmak
ing and domestic science, which they 
could not obtain in the high schools 
of the day. The smallest group were 
those who wanted some kind of a 
schooling in the liberal arts. At once 
the origin of the four schools now ex
isting becomes evident.
With this data on hand the trustees 
set out to build an institution to ac
commodate four thousand students. 
Ten of the best architects in the coun
try were offered a thousand dollars 
each just to enter the competition, and 
all others were invited to submit 
plans. A dark horse, Henry Hornbostel, of New York, won the compe
tition, and has been in a sense the 
architect of the school ever since. We 
now have him with us as the patron 
of the Design School.
On October 5, 1905, the School of 
Applied Science opened its doors to 
an initial registration of one hundred 
and twenty students. It was then 
housed in a part of the present Indus
tries Building. A remarkable fact 
was that the first boy registered was a 
young Scot who wore a plaid band on 
his hat. From this band came the 
idea of making the plaid the color of 
our Alma Mater.
In choosing the faculty, an innova
tion was made in selecting men who 
were successful engineers, rather than 
good students of pedagogy, and sev
eral of these men are still with us. 
Another idea which the Administra
tion tried to incorporate was to give 
the engineer a human side, to make 
him something other than a dry bone 
who was interested in engineering and 
nothing else. So one of the first 
courses started in the Science School 
was one in economics. This close as
sociation of the four schools so dif
ferent in their character was made to 
further this same purpose.
This year sees the fulfillment of the 
dream of 1900; the first registration of 
120 will look small beside this years
4,000, that goal toward which the pion
eers planned.
Trinity College students have re
cently been taking a course that is not 
in the curriculum,namely a course 
in strike-breaking. They have been 
taking the place of Hait and Hegeman Company employees who are 
out on a strike.

PLEBES HOLD SENIORS TO 0-0.
Breaks Against Seniors, Plebes Show 
Strength in Last Quarter.
The Plebes of the Science School 
succeeded in holding 1916 to a 0-0 
score, when they clashed with the 
Senior team on the Tuesday afternoon 
before Thanksgiving. The field was 
too muddy for a fast game, but just 
the same all ninds of open plays were 
tried with more or less success.
In the first half the Plebes were 
played off their feet. On the kickoff 
the Seniors went seventy-five yards 
down the field, and a touchdown 
looked inevitable, but a costly fumble 
proved the Plebes salvation. In this 
period the Plebes made only one 
first down, and this on a forward pass. 
Several times the Seniors were under 
their opponents goal posts, but lack 
of longer training meant fumbles at 
the wrong moment.
In the second half the Plebes team 
was practically fresh, for they had 
unlimited subs, while on the other 
hand the Senior first string stars, In
galls, Wasson and Williams were out 
and their loss keenly felt.
Most of the Plebes gains, and they 
made several in the second half, were 
made by individual stars, Alexander 
at left half, and Walsh at right half 
being the best ground getters.
The only time the Plebes had a 
chance to score was when they had 
the ball on the 10-yard line just at 
the close of the game, but time was 
up before they did anything with 
their chance.

VACATIONING.
Reminiscence of a Middle-Aged Citi
zen.
(EDITORS NOTE.This article has been held over from a previous issue, owing to lack of space.)
Now this matter of summer vaca
tion. As usually committed by other
wise mature citizens of moderate re
sources and of seemly constitution, 
it is a mold form of brain-storm, isnt 
it? Coming right down to brass tacks 
why should one kidnap his helpless 
stomach from gastronomic society 
with which it is on friendly not to 
say familiar terms, and subject it to 
daily assault and battery by the die
tetic criminal element infesting sum
mer resort tables? Doesnt it take at 
least two months in the Fall to effect 
a working compromise with an out
raged liver and to get the vacation 
generally out of ones system with 
the brutal assistance of a physical 
culture ruffian?
And those luxurious bedrooms, at 
least 8x10, with their reinforced con
crete mattress done in impressionist 
style, a ribald washstand and two in
toxicated chairs miraculously inserted 
without spreading the walls. You oc
cupy what space is left in competition 
with a mob of insects having Semitic 
features, who sing cheerily as they 
prod around in your system for liquid 
refreshment and fletcherize your rich 
red city blood oft in the stilly night.
Life in this land of the free is too 
full of early risers in eager pursuit of 
the fat worm you have marked down 
as your own, to allow you ever to 
collect from the drowsy god the ar
rears of sleep due you from these 
unpadded cells (or sells, if you 
please).
Bitter reflections like these made 
more poignant by domestic decrimina
tions attend us in the lucid intervals 
of Fall and Winter evenings. But 
when Spring, Gentle Spring, arrives 
on the job, the painfully acquired 
sanity evaporates in tne rising glow.
We middle-aged parties go gambol
ing stiff-leggedly down the front path 
in matutinal delirium, debating wheth
er to walk to the office or to jump the 
fence and pie the features of our 
neighbor who harbors the misbegotten 
cur with the mutton-ciiop whiskers.
Discretion prevailing, we tilt along 
for three squares with what we fond
ly imagine is a springy tread.
See Jones on a passing car, spring 
nimbly (?) aboard and fall into a fat 
womans lap.
After partially pacifying this indig
nant female and having words with 
the conductor we sneak up on Jones 
and hand him a catapultic wallop be
tween the shoulder blades.
He likewise dippy with vernal in
toxication receives this delicate pleas
antry with a gasping grin, instead of 
righteously kicking us off the car.
In the evening we return somewhat 
chastened to the family bosom load
ed with a cargo of those mendacious 
contributions to current literature in
spired by the sooty muse of the pass
enger agent and leading all other 
best sellers by a length.
You know how these enterprising 
first cousins of Ananias can take the
sordid and angular facts relative to 
a so-called pleasure resort, upholster 
them with florid phraseology and 
catch suckers like you and me with
out mussing a hair.
All of us have read these hallelujah 
choruses about summer paradises 
where we ourselves have bled and all 
but died and have been blamed near 
persuaded to have another go at the 
same place.
Martyred reader, have you ever 
borrowed a clam-rake in the glad
some summer time, walked seventeen 
miles over sun-kissed flats, exca
vated several acres of the blistered 
arena with net result of a pint of 
mutilated clamlets and forty blisters'1
And have you then in the ensuing 
stuffy night watches applied cold 
cream, sweet oil, salt water, tooth
paste, peruna; anything handy, to the 
conflagration raging in your arms and 
legs, your back creaking a requiem at 
every move,
If you have, I ask you as man to 
man, dont you feel like a number six 
hat would come down over your elon
gated ears, when you think of it? And 
did you or did you not, start glee
fully for a stroll along the resound
ing shore (see folders) to some 
point, absurd of course, that appeared 
to be about half a mile away, and 
maintained that distance unimpaired 
for three mortal hours while you 
toiled profanely up to your ankles in 
the ribbed sea sand, a rapt look on 
your face, for publication, and mur
der in your heart? How about it? 
Wasnt it gay? Yes?
Where were we? Oh, yes, putting 
this hypothetical question, as the 
other alenists say, we got a little in
coherent like the rest of them. We 
had just arrived with the literary gold 
bricks.
After dinner the charming matron 
who manages us with one hand (and 
thats no soft job, either) and the do
mestic economy with the other, fell 
upon these fiction numbers, as we 
had intended.
In fifteen minutes she was com
pletely hypnotized by these beauty 
doctors of pimply resorts.
Grinning sardonically but discreet
ly withal, we had slid into our easychair and had ostensibly resumed our 
winter evening dissipation of poring 
over the verbal panoramas of luxuri
ous old age incident to pomo-culture 
and other forms of husbandry with a 
college education.
Funny, isnt it, how many demoted 
citizens (incorporated under the laws 
of New Jersey) insist on macadamiz
ing the humpy old road to success for 
you and me?
Out of the corner of our eye we 
watched those diabolically seductive 
folders getting in their work on the 
feminine mind. Before the evening 
was over she had decided that we 
were going to the mountains for a 
change, since we had previously in
fested the seashore. We put up a good 
bluff about staying at home this sum
mer, suggesting that we could get all 
the effects by entertaining a colony 
of ants for a few nights in our beds 
and eating at a Chinese restaurant. 
She calmly called the bluff by agree
ing and we wilted. Yes, sir, after all

our years of experience we went to

humming a merry lay.

were cordial too and seemed real
