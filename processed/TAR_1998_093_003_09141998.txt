Apartment fire raises 
concerns for students
Free toys!!!
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
Last Friday night at 10 pm, 
firefighters filled the fourth floor 
hallways of Cathedral Mansions. 
By the end of the night they had 
extinguished a small fire in room 
422. Howver, questions about 
the cause of the fire and why the 
buildings fire alarm system did 
not activate even after 911 was 
called remain unanswered.
Jamar Powers, the desk atten
dant on duty at Cathedral Man
sions last Friday, said that at 
about 9:55 pm, he received a call 
from a resident stating that the 
fire alarm for room 422, a Carn
egie Mellon apartment, was ring
ing. When Powers went up to the 
room, smoke was pouring from
under the door. No one responded 
when he knocked.
Powers then returned to the 
front desk where he placed a call 
to 911. Four fire trucks responded 
to the call. Firefighters asked resi
dents in neighboring apartments 
to leave the building while they 
dealt with the fire. However, they 
did not activate the building 
alarm, which had failed to acti
vate on its own.
The firemen decided that it 
was not an emergency situation, 
said junior mechanical engineer
ing major Ken Gould, a fourthfloor resident and the commu
nity advisor for Cathedral Man
sions. There was no immediate 
threat. The officer just advised 
that students open windows and 
ventilate the area.
My personal mental state was 
like it wasnt happening, said 
senior voice major Jennifer 
Manvich, a fifth floor resident. I 
guess I refused to believe there 
was a fire in the building.
I was concerned about all the 
stuff in my room, said freshamn 
mechanical engineering major 
Doug Carrol, a fourth-floor resi
dent. The actual fire alarm didnt 
go off for some reason; I dont 
know why. [But] I saw smoke on 
the fourth floor.
Other students didnt even 
realize that there had been a 
fire. Sophomore art major 
Laura Porter didnt return 
home until 1 am. I dont even 
know about it. I just saw the 
red hose [in the hallway].

President addresses staff concerns

President Cohon spoke with a staff member last Wednesday.
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
Most students at Carnegie Mellon might 
not give much thought to the staff that helps 
make up the foundation of this University. 
Last Wednesday at noon, President Cohon 
showed that h& is both aware of and inter
ested in solving staff problems. Carnegie 
Mellon staff members gave up their lunch 
hour to sit and stand in the aisles of McConomy Auditorium to hear Cohon respond to 
issues that they brought to him as individu
als and through Staff Council.
He certainly covered all of the questions 
we had, said Staff Council President and 
EPP staff member Denise Murrin-Macey. I 
feel that President Cohon wants a greater
involvement from the staff than we have 
had in past administrations. We are very 
happy that he made the point that he would 
be looking at issues simultaneously with 
Staff Council.
Cohon began his speech with the issue of 
staff development. Staff development is part 
of the Universitys strategic planning pro
cess. Cohon stressed that staff would be 
involved in the process of creating the staff 
development program and assured the audi
ence that he was sensitive to the issue of 
performance evaluation. Cohon shied away 
from endorsing a University-wide standard 
and instead stressed that whatever pro
gram is adopted must be based on results 
and outcomes. He explained that it must 
also address the needs of the University.
Staff development is not controversial, but 
if s expensive, and its complicated, said Cohon. 
You have to tune it to the needs of the staff. 
Cohon also addressed staff benefits, tax 
deductions, and the Child Care Center. An 
issue related to the Child Care Center is the 
proposed new dorm that would displace the 
playground currently located between 
Morewood Gardens andMudge House. Cohon 
said that currently the University has no 
plans to move ahead with a dorm on that site.
Cohon shared a laugh with the staff over a 
request to have individuals birthdays added 
as personal holidays, a request he denied. 
The humor was used to transition into the 
more controversial issue of same-sex domes
tic partner benefits.

Ah, parties. They are a part of college 
life. A chance to relax, socialize, meet 
new people, and dull your senses. But 
for the permanent residents on Beeler 
Street, they are a nightmare.
There was a party last year where 
there was a guy tearing outside, run
ning around nude in the front yard, 
said Charles Hirsh, a resident of Beeler 
Street for 27 years.
Permanent residents on Beeler Street, 
most of whom are non-students, have 
identified CMUs party-goers as the 
source of their troubles. They feel they 
have dealt with the noise and drunk 
students long enough and have decided 
to do something about it  even though
most students living on the street are 
unaware of their complaints.
Mr. Hirsh and his wife Elissa have 
headed a movement to address several of 
the issues that the permanent residents 
on Beeler Street have been dealing with. 
Last summer they held a street meeting 
to talk about some of these issues. Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy, As
sociate Dean of Student Affairs Paul 
Fowler, and City Councilman Dan Cohen 
were in attendance. Another meeting will 
be held in October.
We got everyone on this street together 
to talk about what they thought were the 
major problems, said Mrs. Hirsh. We 
determined that the Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, their parties, and their drunken
ness are the number one problems.
I think it is clear that the vast major
ity of students living on Beeler and else-. 
where are good neighbors and good com
munity members, said Murphy. It is 
sad that a few students do not act re
sponsibly and reflect poorly on the ma
jority of students and the University. 
The other permanent residents com
plained about problems, including high 
noise levels, public urination, and de
struction of property. At the last party 
[at our next-door neighbors house] in 
May, there were two paddywagons and 
four police cars that showed up, said Mr. 
Hirsh. The kids ran over and destroyed 
everyones hedges. A few hundred kids 
poured out of this place, and this must 
have been at three in the morning. 
According to the Hirshes, those in 
attendance at the meeting determined

By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Kenton William Shaver, a CMU alum
nus, sustained fatal injuries last Thurs
day when he fell off a moving Amtrak 
train in the Sierra Nevada mountain 
range. He passed away two days later at 
Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nevada.
Shaver, who suffered from blindness 
and deafness, graduated from Carngie 
Mellon last winter and recieved his di
ploma last spring with a B.S. in techni
cal writing. He was 27.
He was the model of perserverance. 
He stuck at it  you would think that a 
person would give up, but he just showed 
everyone that our problems are kind of 
small, said Everett Tademy, director 
of CMUs Equal Opportunity Services. 
Its a shock. He just graduated, and I 
thought that things would blossom a 
little bit for him.
According to Tademy, it took Shaver 
about seven years to work his way 
through CMU. His many disabilities
made everyday tasks such as classes 
and talking to professors difficult. Shaver 
employed the help of a translator who 
would use sign language to convey what 
a professor was teaching. He also had 
student volunteers like Lauren Garcia 
who took class notes for him.
He impressed me so much, especially 
by choosing writing as his field, said 
Garcia, a senior English major. I just 
remember thinking, Wow. With every
thing we go through at school its diffi
cult, but for him to have that added 
pressure  he was amazing.
Shaver attended Alderdice High School 
before coming to Carnegie Mellon. Ac
cording to Tademy, the majority of 
Shavers disabilities, including his deaf
ness and blindmess, resulted from an 
accident he had while still in high school.
Despite his difficulty working through 
school, Shaver participated in extracur
ricular activities at CMU. He wrote a 
column for The Tartan entitled Focused 
on the Internet. He also contributed to 
his community, according to Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Murphy.
One thing that was very special about 
[Shaver] was the community service 
work that he did, said Murphy. Given 
all the other constraints on his time, 
that he did community service is a great 
testament to his character.
While communicating with Shavercould 
be difficult, it could also be rewarding. I 
remember one time he came into my office 
without his interpreter, said Jim Daniels, 
head of the Creative Writing Department. 
We had to type back and forth on the 
computer to talk.... I saved those notes 
because I thought we really connected. 
Whenever a student dies, its incred
ibly sad, said Daniels. But its particu
larly sad when I think about [Shaver] 
and all he had to go through to get 
through school.
Shavers disabilities made him prone 
to balance problems, but Nevada police 
said that an investigation is under way 
to determine if foul play was involved in 
Shavers death. No funeral plans have 
been announced.
Student Senate moves 
along despite vacancies
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
As Student Senate begins its policy 
making for the year ahead, empty seats 
are greeting the returning senators. 
Of the 42 senator positions, 13 are 
vacant to begin the fall term.
Two spring seats and 11 fall seats are 
open currently. A fall seat is one which 
is up for reelection later this semester 
and a spring seat is up for reelection 
next semester. According to Jamie 
Chang, a senior biology major and the 
Senates Human Resources chair, hav
ing a number of vacant seats has not 
been unusual during the last few years, 
but vacancies have not been the norm in 
the longer term. He attributed the va
cancies to students still adapting to the 
new structure of Student Government 
andhavingtrouble knowing if they want 
to participate in government.
The positions are open for a number 
of reasons. A GSIA seat is open because 
the Senator transferred to another Uni
versity. Senators in CFA and CIT re
signed because of time commitments.
Some Senators even graduated. Other 
Senate seats were never filled.
David Liu, a sophomore social and 
decisions sciences major who was 
elected as Senator for H&SS last se
mester, resigned this semester after he 
learned he had a class conflict with 
Senate meetings. I knew Id love the 
job, the responsibility, and the oppor
tunity to serve my college; my heart 
was in it, said Liu. Unfortunately, 
when the time of the Senate Meetings 
was announced, I knew things werent 
going to be easy. Liu was offered alter
natives to remedy the situation, but he 
rejected all of them because he did not 
think he would be giving his college the 
attention it deserved.
Even with four empty H&SS seats, 
Liu insists representation in the col
lege is still strong because the remain
ing Senators are very active in various 
committees. While there is no college 
that is not represented presently inSenate, some are obviously less repre
sented than others. In addition to the 
four empty seats in H&SS and CFA,

White House responds 
to Starrs allegations
WASHINGTON (AP) - Given a day 
to absorb Kenneth Starrs graphic re
port, the White House struck back 
Saturday with a rebuttal assailing the 
prosecutors conclusions as a hit-andrun smear campaign. Lawmakers 
spoke cautiously of impeachment as 
they gauged public reaction backhome.
It is plain that sex is precisely 
what this four-and-a-half year inves
tigation has boiled down to, the White 
House argued in its second counter 
report in two days.
In Atlanta, House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich said the lurid nature of the 
report was unfortunate but caused by 
the presidents denial of a sexual rela
tionship with former White House in
tern Monica Lewinsky. He called on 
lawmakers to reserve judgment.
I think you cannot render ... any 
judgment until you have given the 
president a chance to respond and 
given the Judiciary Committee a 
chance to do its job, Gingrich said.
Clinton, in his weekly radio address, 
noted it had been an exhausting and 
difficult week in the capital  not only 
for me, but for many others. Without a 
mention of the Starr report, he pledged 
to press ahead with his policy agenda.
The most important thing to do 
now is to stay focused on the issues the 
American people sent us here to deal 
with, from health care to the economy 
to terrorism, Clinton said.
Presidential aides, relieved there 
were no new bombshells in the Starr 
report, launched the second offensive 
to encourage Democrats to stand be
hind the President and to ridicule the 
report as tawdry. It marked the start 
of a passionate effort by Clinton to 
argue against removal from office  
one that will for the short term seek to 
paint Starr as a misguided, sex-ob
sessed prosecutor.
Starrs allegations in the Monica 
Lewinsky matter are simply part of a 
hit-and-run smear campaign, and their 
inclusion says volumes about the 
[prosecutors] tactics and objectives,
the White House charged in its 42- 
page response.
The referral is so loaded with irrel
evant and unnecessary graphic and 
salacious allegations that only one con
clusion is possible: its principal pur
pose is to damage the President, the 
rebuttal added.
While President Clintons actions 
were wrong, the acts described by pros
ecutors do not even approach the Constitutional test of impeachment, 
Clintons White House and private 
lawyers argued. Their report provided 
a point-by-point rejection of the 11 
grounds for possible impeachment 
cited in Starrs dramatic referral to 
Congress made public Friday. Presi
dential lawyers argued that:
 Clinton didnt commit peijury by 
telling the grand jury the term sexual 
relations did not apply to the sex acts he 
engaged in with Lewinsky. All prosecu
tors have is a witness who gave narrow 
answers to ambiguous questions, the 
White House said of the President.
 prosecutors erred in contending 
that Clinton obstructed justice by in
stigating the return of his gifts to 
Lewinsky, saying presidential secre
tary Betty Currie contradicts that claim.
 prosecutors erred in arguing 
Clinton tampered with a witness by 
summoning Currie to the White House 
in what the secretary viewed as an 
effort to get her to accept his false 
account of the Lewinsky relationship. 
The White House says it couldnt be 
tampering because she wasnt a wit
ness under subpoena at the time.
Lawmakers this weekend were home 
campaigning and listening to voters. 
The next set of jurors on the case, 
members of the House Judiciary Com
mittee charged with deciding whether 
impeachment proceedings are war
ranted, reacted cautiously.
Obviously he did something wrong, 
said Representative Thomas Barrett, 
a Wisconsin Democrat on the commit
tee. You dont violate your marriage 
promises and walk away from it.
Ketchup maker 
sells bakery unit
PITTSBURGH (AP) - H.J. Heinz 
Co. is selling its Canadian-based bak
ery products unit to The Pillsbury Co. 
for $178 million.
The Pittsburgh-based food company also 
posted a 12 percent decline in its earnings 
for the first fiscal quarter on Tuesday.
Heinz stock rose $21/2, or 4 percent, to 
$54.18 3/4 amid a broad rally on the New 
York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
Heinz Bakery Products, based in 
Mississauga, Ontario, is a $200 mil
lion business that makes unbaked fro
zen bagels and bread dough for retail, 
wholesale, and food-service outlets in 
North America.
William Johnson, Heinz president 
and chief executive, said that while the 
business has performed well, it is not 
in one of the eight core areas on which 
Heinz is focusing.
Paul Walsh, chief executive of Minne
apolis-based Pillsbury, said the Heinz 
bakery division fits well with existing 
Pillsbury businesses.
In its earnings report, Heinz attrib
uted the decline to costs associated with 
Project Millennia, its reorganization and 
growth plan.
Net income dropped to $213 million, 
or 58 cents per diluted share, in the 
quarter ended July 29 from $243 mil
lion, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were down 0.2 percent to $2,228 
billion from $2,233 billion a year ago. 
The company blamed unfavorable for
eign exchange translation rates and the 
impact of divestitures and acquisitions 
for the decline. Heinz said without those 
factors, sales were up 5 percent.
Thick dust coat 
covers Mars moon
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Phobos, the 
larger of Mars two small moons, is cov
ered in hip-deep dust formed by meteor
oid impacts over millions of years, ac
cording to images captured by the orbit
ing Mars Global Surveyor.
Some of the rocky poundings also cre
ated landslides on steep crater slopes.
Inside the bowl of a prominent 6-mile 
crater called Stickney are light and dark
streaks where debris tumbled downhill
 an indication that even with gravity 
just 1/1,000th of what is experienced on 
Earth, objects are still pulled downward. 
Large boulders more than 160 feet across 
also appear embedded in the surface.
The images and temperature read
ings released Friday by NASA research
ers help to paint a picture of what its 
like on this lumpy, potato-shaped moon.
Daytime temperatures are like those 
during a pleasant winter afternoon in 
Chicago, about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, 
while the thermometer dips at night to a 
harsh minus 170 degrees, colder than an 
Antarctic night.
Night and day switch quickly: A day 
on Phobos is just seven hours.
Researchers suspect the powder on 
Phobos to be at least 3 feet deep.
This has to be incredibly fine powder 
formed from impacts over millions of 
years, and it looks like the whole surface 
is made up of fine dust, said Philip 
Christensen of Arizona State Univer
sity, the principal investigator for the 
thermal emission spectrometer, which 
uses light to detect surface composition.
Phobos, the Greek word for fear, is 
about 16 miles wide. The other moon, 
Deimos (Greek for terror), is about 9 
miles wide.
The $250 million Mars Global Sur
veyor, launched on November 7, 1996, 
began orbiting the planet in September 
1997. It was designed to map Martian 
terrain for a Martian year, equivalent to 
687 Earth days, beginning in 1998.
The mapping mission has been pushed 
back to 1999 because of a solar panel 
problem and could be further delayed by 
concerns about the spacecrafts commu
nications antenna.
On Monday, the spacecraft is due to 
begin the second phase of aerobraking, a 
process in which it dips into the fringes of 
the Martian atmosphere to trim its ellip
tical orbit gradually and make it circular.
The spacecraft is part of a 10-year 
program of Mars exploration.
Relations break 
down in Mideast
TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  Iran will stage 
extensive military maneuvers on its bor
der with Afghanistan in a show of force 
now that the Taliban has admitted that 
its soldiers killed nine Iranian diplomats.
More than 200,000 soldiers will par
ticipate in the maneuvers, which are set 
to begin around the last week of Septem
ber, the commander of Irans ground 
forces, Brigadier General Abdolali 
Purshasb, was quoted as saying by Ira
nian television Saturday.
They will mark the second maneuvers 
in less than a month on the countrys 
rugged eastern border.
Iran vowed on Friday to avenge the 
killing of its diplomats. The Taliban, 
which controls about 90 percent of Af
ghanistan, admitted earlier that its sol
diers had killed them after taking th 
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif 
on August 8.
Iran said two other diplomats escaped, 
but their whereabouts were still un
known. The fate of a reporter for the 
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency 
remained unclear.
The ground and air maneuvers will 
take place across a 20,000-square-mil 
area stretching along Irans border with 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Some of the 70,000 troops who com
pleted three days of military exercises in 
the beginning of September have re: 
mained there.
Iran supports the opposition allianc 
that was driven from its northern head
quarters in Mazar-e-Sharif. The Taliban 
have accused Iran of arming the opposi
tion, a charge Tehran denies.
Man dies while 
fighting Medicaid
NORWICH, Conn. (AP) - A man suf
fered a fatal heart attack Saturdy as he 
and hundreds of other senior citizens 
confronted insurance companies over 
plans to stop their Medicare coverage.
The death cut short a heated health care 
forum with Connecticut congressmen, so
cial service representatives,.-and officials 
of three insurance companies. The compa
nies last week sent letters to 6,000 resi
dents of eastern Connecticut, saying costs 
were too high and the federal reimburse
ment rate was too low to continue their 
supplemental Medicare coverage.
Fredrick Krai, 72, of East Lyme, had 
just finished denouncing the insurance 
companies when he fell ill. Dr. Anthony 
Alessi, a panelist at the forum, attempted 
to resuscitate Krai, but he died at th 
hospital a short time later.
Americans swamp government Web sites to read Starrs report
NEW YORK (AP) - The 
Internet showed it was not quite 
ready for prime time when milions 
of people worldwide swamped 
government computers and Web 
sites in search of Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starrs report 
about President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky.
But by the end of the work day 
on the East Coast Friday, traffic 
seemed to have eased on the news 
sites and the report was easier to 
download on major commercial 
sites such as Yahoo! and Lycos. 
Some called it the Internets busi
est day ever.
This is the first big test of the 
Internet to distribute a lot of 
data, said Mark Simmer, a vice
president at Web directory Lycos. 
It wasnt designed as a broad
cast medium. It was designed as 
a communication medium. Its 
like everyone lifting up the same 
phone to talk to their mother on 
Mothers Day.
Possibly most telling in the 
Webs acceptance as a toddling 
mass medium was Congress 
decision to use it to distribute 
the report.
Still, there were fumbles. An 
hour after the report was released, 
the White House, Senate, and 
House Web sites were hopelessly 
snarled, as were the four other 
government sites offering it.
All across the Internet, the 
slowdown was felt. According to
the Internet Traffic Report, a Web 
site that monitors and indexes 
the Nets speed, North America 
and Europe were most affected, 
especially the areas around New 
York and Washington. Even callingunrelated Web sites was some
times sluggish.
Gene Shklar, a spokesman for 
Keynote Systems Inc., a company 
that tracks Internet performance, 
said thr trouble was in getting 
into the sites. Once users got in, 
they usually could quickly view 
the document.
The slowdown shows the Web is 
still primitive, said Abdelsalam 
Heddaya, vice president of 
Infolibria, a maker of computers 
that move data around the Net.
Another problem, he said, is 
flash crowds  hordes of 
Internet users suddenly inter
ested in a single site. That prob
lem can only grow as more 
people come online, adding to 
the approximately 70 million 
regular Internet users in the 
United States.
As the wired population grows, 
the news sites will have trouble  
keeping up with the crowds. But 
they are trying.
The news Web site 
MSNBC.com reported 26 servers 
working at full capacity  and 
more were being installed to meet 
demand  but at times in the 
afternoon it was still inaccessible 
or slow to respond.
Once the report was posted, 
CNNs Web site was getting 
more than 400,000 hits a 
minute, said spokesman Kerrin 
Roberts. That was higher than 
the record 320,000 a minute 
August 31 when the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunged. 
To ease the crush, CNN.com 
stripped out most pictures 
and graphics to present a fastloading version.
On America Online, usage in
creased by 30 percent over the 
same time period last week.
At the Washington Posts Web 
site, Based on our bandwidth, 
weve done three times our big
gest day ever, said spokeswoman 
Erin OShea.
Traffic on The Associated Press 
Web site peaked at about 20 times 
the normal load just prior to th 
release shortly before 2 pm, said 
Ruth Gersh, editor of the APs 
multimedia services.
Still, with the cyber-rush, frus
tration was inevitable. Even tele
vision anchors had problems get
ting the report quickly. If some
body wants to step over to the fax 
machine and fax us, wed appre
ciate it, said CBS Dan Rather.
An ABC News poll taken Friday 
evening found 57 percent think 
Clinton should be impeached if he 
encouraged Lewinsky to He about 
their relationship  an increase 
of 14 points since August 21 and 6 
points since Wednesday.

50 YEARS AGO, September
29,1948  Many upperclassmen 
were wondering what became of 
the traditional freshman hand
book usually available at regis
tration. The sad truth was that 
the handbook was lost in the mail.
In the meantime, in order to 
present freshmen with the infor
mation necessary for the Tradi
tions exam, a brief substitute was 
mimeographed and made avail
able through the office of the Dean 
of Men.
25 YEARS AGO, October 2, 
1973  CMU commuters were 
upset at the City of Pittsburghs 
decision to install parking meters 
along Tech and Frew Streets.
Joseph Cosetti, City Treasurer, 
said the fact that the commuters 
and employees arrived early in 
the morning and tied up the spaces
for an eight-hour work day or a 
full day of classes was an improper 
use of on-street parking.
He said, On-street parking is 
designed for short visits. Full
time commuters and workers 
ought to use public transporta
tion. Were not very sympathetic 
to people who want to take their 
cars to work.
10 YEARS AGO, September
20,1988  Federal funds for the 
controversial Software Engineer
ing Institute emerged without a 
scratchfrom a storm of federal 
budget cuts for fiscal 1989.
Strong support by the Senate 
majority leader was largely re
sponsible for SEI keeping its fed
eral funding.
During the same week, Vincent 
Eirene gave a lecture in Baker 
Hall entitled Non-violent Con
frontation: The Disarming of 
CMU, during which he criticized 
SEIs federal funding, and he pur
ported that the institute did re
search on nuclear weapons.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Septem
ber 14, 1993  The University 
Computing Center was rechris
tened Richard M. Cyert Hall in 
honor of the Universitys sixth 
president. The ceremony was held 
in a tent between Warner Hall 
and Cyert Hall.
The building was the obvious 
choice to honor the former presi
dent, who was president of CMU 
between 1972 and 1990. He led 
CMU into the computer age in the 
early 1980s, when computer still 
meant rare mainframes. Arequest 
for a network in the Computer 
Science Department inspired his 
vision of a network that would
provide computer access for ev
eryone everywhere on campus.
ONE YEAR AGO, September 
15 1997  The student co-op on 
Margaret Morrison Street, which 
had been closed since December 
of 1996, reopened as Entropy 
East. The store provided mor$ 
grocery items, as well as a large 
selection of microwaveable and 
frozen foods.
Some services were cut from 
those that had been available at 
the co-op, such as the labor-inten
sive deli. These cuts were made in

BEELER, from page 1
ithat there simply has not been 
Renough communication between 
the residents and the students. 
Mrs. Hirsh said, What happened 
after this meeting was that 
.people realized they needed to 
: :go to the students who lived near 
ithem, knock on the door, and 
ay, Look, Id like to be helpful 
rjto you. Ill lend you a hammer, 
[but in return Id expect you to 
show some respect. 
Many residents have been 
moving off the street, which
opens the possibility of more 
units being available for rental 
by students.
We have to worry about this 
turning into a South Oakland, said 
Mrs. Hirsh. If the value of our 
homes goes down, and we all end up 
selling, only the people who want to 
house students will own houses on 
this street. When this street goes to 
pot, it hurts everyone.
CMU has also been working on 
opening its communication lines 
with students on Beeler Street. 
Dean Murphy and two students,
who have taken an active role on 
the streets committee, have been 
working on a letter to Beeler 
Street students, detailing steps 
that they can take to be more 
neighborly and also to keep them
selves out of trouble.
Originally, this letter was to 
have been sent to students at the 
beginning of the academic year. 
It would have been helpful to 
have contact with students on 
the street by now, said Murphy. 
This was bad judgment on my 
part not to do so.
Students, the administration, 
and the permanent residents feel 
that the problems on the street 
can be resolved. It only makes 
sense that students should show 
respect for their neighbors, said 
Traber Campbell, a junior electri
cal and computer engineering 
(ECE) major and a resident of 
Beeler Street. If they do that, the 
there shouldnt be any problems. 
There was a huge party on 
Wilkins last night, said Erin Burr, 
a junior ECE major living on 
Beeler Street. Sure, parties with
400 people are great to talk about 
the next day, but they dont be
long in a residential setting. One 
of the nicest things about Beeler is 
that it is close to campus, and yet 
is a complete escape from campus.
I can come home after school, re
lax on my porch, and forget about 
the day for a while.
My overall impression is that 
the neighbors and students rec
ognize that Beeler is a special 
residential area, for students and 
non-students, said Murphy. All 
of us, including students on the
street, need to be a little more 
active in pushing back when stu
dents act in a way which is inap
propriate or illegal.
Mr. Hirsh said that he enjoys 
living on a street with such a mix 
of people. We love it now when 
the kids are back, he said, and 
theres so much vitality on the 
street. But he also added, John 
Stuart Mill said, Tour rights end 
where mine begin, and when kids 
start infringing on our rights and 
our neighbors rights, then the 
kids are wrong.
CMU Center tests new 
TA evaluation options
By JENNY GARCIA de OSUNA
Tartan Contributing Editor
We may soon be seeing marked im
provements in the quality of teaching 
assistants through efforts being made 
in developing TA evaluations and a new 
book available to assist TAs.
The Eberly Center for Teaching Ex
cellence is currently in the process of 
developing new evaluations for teach
ing assistants. In the past, the Faculty 
Course Evaluations have been the only 
source of feedback departments and 
professors have had from students. 
However, it is clear that the role TAs 
have in the classroom is highly impor
tant. TAs have a lot of contact with 
students during recitations, labs, and 
discussion sections. In large first-year 
lecture courses, many times TAs have a 
larger impact in students understanding of the material than the professors 
because of their ability to obtain a 
; greater teacher-to-student ratio.
The reason we are doing this is that 
we would like to provide information to 
make TAs into better teachers, said 
Dr. Rebecca Freeland, associate direc
tor of the Eberly Center. Thats our 
primary goal.
There are two types of evaluations in 
progress. The early evaluation form is 
meant to be distributed sometime duringthe first six weeks of a full-semester 
course. These early evaluations allow 
TAs to make changes in their method of 
teaching early in the course. The sec
ond type is the end-of-the-course evalu
ation, where feedback at the end of the 
semester is used to further improve 
TAs future teaching skills and to allow 
the departments to monitor their 
courses and academic programs.
This program is not just [the Eberly 
Center] saying that TAs need help; we 
have gotten a lot of feedback along the 
way and hope to make improvements in 
the quality of our courses, said Freeland.
The evaluations have not yet been 
officially implemented into courses. At 
this point, weve conducted two small 
pilot studies, and we are currently ana
lyzing the data and getting feedback, 
said Freeland.
In addition to TA evaluations, the 
Eberly Center has developed a new 
book, Collected Wisdom: Strategies and 
Resources for TAs to assist TAs in ob
taining teaching strategies and other 
helpful hints. The book includes over 
200 teaching strategies expressed by 
experienced TAs and professors, and 
strategies for the different roles ex
pected in a recitation, lab, or discus
sion section. Current TAs will be re
ceiving a copy of the book at their 
departmental orientation.
President delivers annual update
STAFF, from page 1
Before Cohon came to Carnegie Mell
on, Staff Council passed a resolution 
that addressed benefits for both samesex domestic partners and married 
couples. That resolution has not yet 
been acted on by the University. Cohon 
stated that the issue was related to 
diversity on campus. He then outlines 
the actions the University is taking to 
reach a conclusion.
Every one of our constituents can, 
and should, and will be more diverse, 
said Cohon. On this I will be adamant 
and provide leadership. It is an issue 
that is sensitive. It gets people angry 
and upset. But thats not a reason to 
avoid it, and we wont.
Cohon stopped short of saying that he 
was in favor of benefits for same-sex 
domestic partners, but added that he is 
committed to coming to an outcome that 
is good for the University.
Benefits for part-time employees also 
came up at the address. Cohon stated 
plainly that the University had no in
tentions of increasing the number of 
benefits afforded to part-time staff.
Change in benefits for part-time em
ployees is an important issue, said 
Murrin-Macey afterwards. We will be 
continuing discussions with Dr. Cohon. 
The last issue that President Cohon 
addressed in his prepared remarks was 
that of parking. He reviewed the current 
situation and explained that those who
received spaces from the University were 
paying low rates compared to the rest of 
the region. However, he did not offer any 
solutions to the shortage of spaces which 
affects all members of the University.
Cohon announced a program being de
veloped in conjunction with the School of 
Drama to build a sensitivity training pro
gram. The skits developed in this program 
will be put on CD-ROMs and made avail
able to the campus community.
In closing remarks, Cohon reassured 
the staff that they are valued by his 
administration.
The staff is this University as much 
as faculty, students, or anyone else, 
said Cohon. You are as much a part of 
[CMUs] success as anyone else.
Police continue to investigate fire
FIRE, from page 1
Many other residents of Cathedral 
Mansions, who would have to rely upon 
stairs in the case of a fire, were unaware 
of the fire while it was happening.
As of now, the official cause of the 
fire has not been released. Carnegie 
Mellon Campus Police have refused to 
comment on the pending investiga
tion, but they have said that the fire 
has been ruled an accident. At the 
scene, a fire department official ex
plained to residents that an object had 
probably fallen on an electrical cord 
and caused the wire to smolder and
produce smoke but not a large or dan
gerous fire. Junior design major Hillary 
Carey, the resident assistant on duty at 
Cathedral Mansions that night, said the 
same thing.
But Powers gave a different story. 
Powers said that a candle left burning 
by the residents had caused a table to 
catch fire. A source, who wished to re
main anonymous, corroborated the story. 
The source also reported that drug para
phernalia including a water pipe and 
rolling paper were present. The allega
tions of drug involvement are uncon
firmed at this point.
However if a candle was the cause of the 
fire, the residents of422 were in violation 
of University Housing Policy. Candles are 
prohibited in University Housing because 
of the fire threat they pose.
Powers also said that he was unsure 
of the reason for the building-wide fire 
alarms failure to activate.He said when 
he called the company that services the 
system, they only told him to reset it.
Carnegie Mellon police expect that the 
investigation into the fire will be com
pleted by Thursday or Friday.

Empty seats dont stop Senators
SENATE, from page 1
there are three empty seats in 
CIT and one in GSIA, and one 
miscellaneous seat which can only 
be filled by a BHA student. Senate 
seats are distributed based on the 
number of students in each col
lege. There is one Senator for ap
proximately every 140 students.
Changbelieves the empty seats 
only pose a problem at the com
mittee level. He said that the 
committees are not the size they 
should be, but this problem will 
be corrected as soon as the empty 
seats are filled.
The vacancies will be filled 
on a rolling basis. In order to be
considered for a vacant Senate 
seat, a student must submit a 
petition with at least 25 signa
tures of Activities Fees-paying 
students in his or her college. 
Senate must then approve the 
candidate. If there is more than 
one student vying for a posi
tion, Senate will choose the 
winner. The ultimate deadline 
for all vacancies to be filled is 
October 12. Chang said he has 
already received petitions for 
CIT and GSIA.
The creation of a separate gov
erning body for the Graduate Stu
dent Association (GSA) will al
low Senate to focus more on un
dergraduate student interests 
than in years past.
Previously Student Senate 
was supposed to represent all stu
dents, but unfortunately, the 
graduate Student Senate seats 
were usually vacant, said Sarah 
Gross, a junior social and deci
sion sciences major and student 
body president. In essence, 
graduate students views werent 
really represented.
Even though its shorthanded 
at the moment, Senate will con
tinue with its normal activities. 
Currently, the various commit
tees are meeting to set agendas 
for the upcoming year.

CMU should expand 
benefits program
The administration has formed 
a committee to look into the pos
sibility of expanding same-sex 
domestic partnership benefits. 
But after seven years of waiting, 
its difficult to view this commit
tee as a substantive, pro-active 
step. The committees formation 
instead reinforces the fact that 
the administration is still drag
ging its heels on granting full, 
equal benefits for same-sex do
mestic partnerships. This delay 
is unacceptable in a diverse com
munity such as CMU. Action 
should be taken as soon as pos
sible to improve same-sex domes
tic partnership benefits.
In 1991, former President 
Mehrabian announced that CMU 
would officially recognize domes
tic partnerships  existing com
mitted relationships regardless 
of sexual orientation, including 
opposite-sex partners who do not 
choose to marry. With this recog
nition came the extension of a 
limited-benefits program that did 
not include medical benefits. It 
seemed as though the CMU com
munity was taking its first steps 
toward equal benefits for samesex partnerships. But after three 
years, the administration made 
no further moves toward grant
ing domestic partners the full 
benefits that married couples re
ceive.
In 1994, a member of the faculty 
and a member of the staff submit
ted a 20-page proposal to the ad
ministration outlining why CMU 
should increase the scope of its 
benefit program and how other 
universities and companies have
this through extended recogni
tion of domestic partnerships. 
Once again, the administration 
took no action to expand domestic 
partner benefits.
Now, in 1998, the administra
tion is passing the issue off to a 
committee for investigation. 
While its better than nothing, 
this action isnt promising for the 
many staff and faculty involved 
in same-sex domestic partner
ships who have been waiting years 
to receive the same benefits as 
their married colleagues. CMU 
should follow in the footsteps of 
other universities such as MIT, 
University of Pennsylvania, and 
Stanford University in granting 
full benefit programs that include 
medical coverage. Also, the ex
cuse that no leading Pittsburgh 
employer has moved to a fullbenefits plan for domestic part
ners is weak, especially since 
Microsoft, Lotus, and Apple ex
tended their full-benefits plans to 
same-sex partnerships five years 
ago.
Too often at this University, we 
mistake tolerance for support. We 
say were a diverse, supportive 
community, one which is wonder
ful because we learn so much from 
each other. But if this really were 
a supportive community, the ad
ministration would extend its full 
benefits to domestic and samesex partnerships. Only by ensur
ing that all of the members of the 
CMU community receive the same 
benefits can this University jus
tify its claim to being non-discriminatory on the basis of sexual 
orientation!Students need 
presidential address
President Cohon presented his 
address to Carnegie Mellon staff 
last week. The event left some 
wondering why such a helpful and 
informative annual event is re
served just for CMU staff. A presi
dential address would also be valu
able and meaningful for the stu
dent body. It could even become a 
campus tradition, and at the same 
time, open more lines of communi
cation between the administration 
and the student body.
Although Cohon is accessible to 
all students during his open office 
hours, many dont take advan
tage of this opportunity. While 
its nice that he holds office hours, 
this doesnt seem to be the most 
effective manner of addressing 
student concerns. Some students 
mayfeel uncomfortable approach
ing a high-ranking administrator 
with what they might consider a 
insignificant problem. But if many 
students have similar problems, 
yet none of them approach the 
administration because they 
think their concern is not impor
tant, the problem will never be 
resolved. An annual presidential 
address to the students would be 
a great way for students to realize 
there are many common issues 
that can be discussed openly with 
administration.
A presidential address to stu
dents should be structured like 
last weeks staff address: Before 
the meeting, students send quesJames Mojonnier/Tartan Art EditorCrash highlights fears of flying
Dave Liber
tions they want answered and 
problems they wanted addressed; 
during the address, Cohon de
scribes the administrations posi
tion on these issues and the steps 
being taken to solve each; after
wards, the floor is opened for an 
open question and answer session.
Bringing everyone together for 
this event could provide the sense 
of community that CMU so often 
lacks. After all, the purpose of 
meeting with the staff wasnt only 
to address their problems; it was 
also to inform them about issues 
and current thinking in the ad
ministration, to keep them up-todate with University-wide con
cerns. Students might be reluc
tant to attend such an event at 
first, but with time, they will be
gin to see that such a forum is 
beneficial for them as individuals 
and as a community.
To make a Presidential address 
to students meet its fall potential, 
it needs to become a CMU tradi
tion. If a meeting like this takes 
place at least every year, perhaps 
on a significant date in CMUs 
history, it could become an infor
mative discussion with adminis
tration as well as a way to bring 
the entire student body together. 
Communication between students 
and administration is a two-way 
street, but University officials 
clearly have the upper hand in 
initiating the first step toward a 
constant, open dialogue.
Every time we board a commercial 
jet, we are entering a machine made up 
of over two million parts that must 
work together to deliver us safely 
to our destination. Knowing this, we 
must consider what happened to 
SwissAir Flight #111 to be an inevi
table risk when flying. However, it is 
not a precedent.
Flight #111, which crashed into the 
cold waters of the North Atlantic two 
weeks ago, was bound for Geneva from
New Yorks John F. __________________
Kennedy Interna
tional Airport with 
229 passengers and 
crew aboard. The 
plane in question 
was an MD-11 made 
by the McDonnell 
Douglass division of 
Boeing. The MD-11 
has served success
fully in the fleets of TTHHEET 
many safe airlines 
including KLM, Delta, American, 
Garuda, Allitalia, and China Eastern. 
McDonnell Douglass has delivered 
over 170 models in total, but has expe
rienced only two hull losses, includ
ing the recent SwissAir crash, with 
the MD-11.
Many Americans become preoccupied 
by concern over air safety after an air
craft accident. Yet spokespeople for 
Boeing, the worlds largest maker of 
commercial airplanes, cite statistics that 
should put any fears to rest.
Recently at the Farnborough Airshow, 
Boeing cited that, in 1997, 1.3 billion
people flew on over 18 million flights, 
but only 11 died in accidents. Statisti
cally speaking, even if you are actually 
involved in an aircraft accident, you 
still stand a greater chance of living 
than of dying. Air travel is safer than 
any other mode of transport in this 
country. However, the flying public still 
fears boarding an aircraft and taking 
off into the friendly skies. No matter 
how many statistics Boeing, Airbus, or 
the government throws at us, people 
will always love flying, but also fear 
it. So why are Americans so frightened 
of flying?
One reason might be that, for many 
people, an airplane is the most foreign 
place they will ever enter. When you

However, the flying public still fears

board an aircraft, you enter very unfa
miliar surroundings. You find yourself 
encased in an aluminum tube for the 
next few hours, hurtling through the 
skies with nothing to do but watch the 
in-flight movie, talk to the interesting 
person sitting next to you, look out the 
window at those puffy white clouds, eat 
bad food, drink liquor, or hit on the cabin 
crew. With these options, it is no wonder 
people hate flying.
Some people fear flying based on the 
realization that they might not be able 
to do much in the event of an accident. 
Unlike when we drive, we surrender
much of our independence when we fly. 
The passengers and crew of SwissAir 
flight #111, like those of all flights, placed 
their safety and their very lives in the 
hands of two trained pilots. No matter 
how many hours the pilots spend in 
a simulator, no matter how many flight 
hours they accumulate, it is still un
nerving to know that the safety of 
hundreds of people rests in the hands 
of so few.
Feelings of powerlessness are com
pounded by fuzziness about what would 
actually happen in the event of an acci
dent. The safety lecture you receive as 
youre about to take off is hardly enough 
preparation for the insanity that could 
follow. Most people know how to buckle 
their seat belts  theyve been 
doing it for many years now, and 
theyre probably quite proficient 
at it. However, they do not know 
how to crawl out of a burning 
heap of metal, wires, seats, bag
gage, bodies, and packs of compli
mentary peanuts. Perhaps to ease 
the publics fear of flying, the avia
tion industry must be more truth
ful with us. If people knew exactly how likely it was that there 
would be an emergency and ex
actly what would be expected of them 
in such a situation, they might be 
less nervous.
The crash of SwissAir flight #111 is, of 
course, a tragedy. However, the fear of 
flying most Americans have has no base 
in any rational reason. It is a fear based 
on the intimidating concept of flying 
itself  of taking off and traveling at 
hundreds of miles an hour thousands of 
feet in the air.

Faulty equipment has writer sweating
r Justin CinaJustin Cina
At the beginning of last 
year, students quickly discov
ered, to their dismay, that 
the renovations to Skibo Gym 
were really just a cruel hoax. 
Some red upholstery and 
some cheesy new equipment 
(the kind thats so thin it 
rattles as you work out) were 
added, but on the whole, the 
gym was still inadequate. 
This year, when the Skibo 
regulars returned, they found 
that the cheesy equipment 
was already inoperable and 
the red upholstery was al
ready worn. What do you sup
pose that means for the equip
ment thats so old it can only 
be dated by unstable isotopes? 
Well, take whatever you sup
pose and imagine it worse.
Each and every day in the 
Skibo Gym is a pitiless 
struggle. To get through the 
exercises involved in a single 
muscle group may very well 
be one of the most frustrating 
experiences of your life. Prac
tically half the equipment is 
either completely broken, 
completely outdated, or is in 
such an unacceptable state 
that it is impossible for a 
proper and safe workout. 
Wires are fraying on Nautilus 
equipment, pins are lodged in 
machines, weights are incon
sistent, and parts are loose on 
everything from benches to 
the sole curl bar. The major
ity of dumbbells are broken, 
bent, or missing. In order to 
do exercises requiring them, 
you have to take a quick run 
to the UC.
Why not just go to the UC,

Maggie Mo, has all the basic 
equipment used in resistance 
training and bodybuilding, in
cluding bench presses, mili
tary benches, squat racks, curl 
bars, and dumbbells over 70 
pounds. The UC does not.

Good Samaritan Law raises moral issues
Case shows need for responsibility
Open Forum
by Lorelei Laird
The folk wisdom is that actions speak 
louder than words, but sometimes inac
tion says just as much. Take the case of 
David Cash Jr. On a weekend trip to Las 
Vegas, he noticed that Jeremy 
Strohmeyer, a friend and a fellow high 
school senior, had followed seven-yearold Sherrice Iverson into a ladies 
restroom. Curious, he followed, only to 
find Strohmeyer strangling the little girl 
and threatening to kill her if she 
screamed. Cash tried to get his friends 
attention, but after knocking his hat off 
and getting no response, he decided to 
take a walk. Later, when asked why he 
didnt stop Strohmeyer or notify security 
guards, Cash said that he didnt think 
there was any cause for concern  though 
he did ask Strohmeyer later if Iverson 
had been aroused. An hour after he 
left, they found the girls broken body 
in a toilet.
Now Cash faces possible charges as 
an accessory to the molestation and 
murder, an angry coalition wants to 
kick him out of UC Berkeley, and radio 
DJs scream that they hope he bums in 
hell. Somehow, I cant feel particularly 
sorry for him.
There are a whole host of details that 
are more and more damning for Cash, 
but more relevant are the larger issues 
that the case raises  do we have a 
moral duty to intervene when a crime is 
being committed? Should we have a 
legal duty to do so? Some Californians 
think so. Theyre trying to push through 
legislation  Sherrices Law  that 
would require witnesses to report cases 
of sexual assault against children, as 
well as petitioning to dismiss Cash from 
Berkeley. It seems clear to me that since 
Cashs tresspasses are not ah academic 
matter, there are no grounds for expel
ling him. Its simply not up to universi
ties to judge their students actions. That 
debate would become moot, however, 
were he to be charged and convicted 
under such a law as the coalition wishes 
to pass. Its hard to commute to Berke
ley from San Quentin.
While at first glance the idea of government-mandated tattling seems ty
rannical, its actually not a new concept. 
Several states already have such laws 
on their books, and social workers and
Legislation invites civil rights abuse
school guidance counselors, at least in 
California, are required to report suspected 
sexual abuse as well. Since this is the first 
Ive heard of their existence, I suspect that 
the precautions written into the law to 
ensure that powerless bystanders arent 
unfairly prosecuted work. With the appro
priate safeguards, Sherrices Law could 
do more good than harm. Im not sure that 
such legislation would work, but its cer
tainly worth a shot.
Closer to home, there are ramifications of 
this in terms of college ethics as well. Cash 
is studying nuclear engineering. My first 
thought when I read that was: Were let
ting a guy with that sort of personal respon
sibility near a nuclear reactor? Im sure 
hes not the only student of potentially 
dangerous technology 
in the country whose 
ethics need correction.
Students need to be impressed with the re
sponsibility inherent in 
technological knowl
edge, and universities 
need to play an active 
part in that.
Then theres the so
cial aspect. It was esti
mated that Strohmeyer 
had had four beers on 
the night of the mur
der. When the pair later 
discussed possible de
fenses for Strohmeyer, 
they came to the bril
liant conclusion that 
since he had been 
slightly drunk, perhaps
he could be excused on Corey
grounds of temporary insanity. This strikes 
me as frighteningly close to the rationale 
that certain rapists, husbands, and Presi
dents use to excuse their actions  It wasnt 
my fault! The woman/penis/alcohol made 
me do it! I find it a sad and frightening 
commentary on our culture that they seri
ously thought We let the beer do the think
ing was going to fly in court. Is personal 
responsibility dead? This attitude is not 
uncommon, and at any university, where 
heavy drinking is bound to occur, it should 
be addressed.
Personal responsibility should not be a 
new concept. Its pathetic that we as a 
people should feel that we need to legislate 
it, pathetic that a sophomore at a wellrespected university should feel that he is 
above it, and just plain sad that a little girl 
should have to lose her life to remind the 
rest of us that were not.

It would be hard to find a more vile crime 
than last years torture and murder of a 
seven-year-old girl in a Nevada casino 
bathroom stall. It would be hard to imag
ine an individual act of greater savagery, 
and even harder to conjure up a mote of 
sympathy for the affluent young student 
who committed it. He was accompanied to 
the scene ofthe crime 
by a friend from 
school, who satin the 
stall next door to his, 
and who presumably 
had full knowledge 
of the events occur
ring a few feet away 
from him. Not only 
did this Mend do 
nothing to stop the 
killer, not only did 
he do nothing to no
tify the authorities, 
but when the trial 
was concluded, he 
cheerfullyremarked 
to the Los Angeles 
Times that he hoped 
to use his newfound 
fame to score with 
women. Although 
Shopper/Tartan Art Staff he committed no 
crime under Nevada state law, his associa
tion with the murder and his cavalier 
attitude toward it have provoked a reac
tion from a coalition of citizensaction 
groups, led by the victims mother. Some 
20,000 signatures have been amassed to
wards a petition for a Good Samaritan 
law  Sharisses Law  which will make 
it a ciime to witness the sexual assault of 
a minor without reporting it to the police. 
The nickname for the law, which suggests 
a voluntary act of goodwill, is somewhat 
inaccurate, as the proposed law will penal
ize people who dont report such assaults.
Any change to our civil rights laws 
should be made with excruciating care. 
The foremost guideline in the minds of 
the revisionists should not be how a law 
can be used against criminals, but how it 
could be exploited to other, less honorable 
ends. While this proposed law focuses 
only on sexual assault, making it a reality 
could open the door to legislation with a 
much broader scope. Quite simply, the 
ability to punish someone for the mere
awareness of a criminal act sets a danger
ous precedent  just ask Lenny Bruce. 
From 1962 onwards, his politically loaded 
stand-up act was besieged with charges of 
obscenity, which he fought tenaciously 
until his suicide in 1966. On at least one 
occasion, when they couldnt get an obscen
ity rap to stick, law enforcement officials 
shut down his act using a California state 
law under which, if you were knowingly 
present in a place where illegal drugs were 
being kept, you could be punished for not 
notifying the police. The true extent of a 
suspects knowledge is impossible to con
cretely prove, so in theory it would follow 
that such a lack of evidence would result in 
an acquittal. In practice, the law provided 
an excellent pretext for arresting political 
dissidents, few of whom had Lennys finan
cial resources to keep them out of prison.
To obtain a conviction with this law, its 
necessary to assume the guilt of the ac
cused, which contradicts the most funda
mental principles of our legal system.
Todays DEA can commit civil rights vio
lations (seizing property, freezing bank ac
counts, and making searches and arrests 
without a warrant) in broad daylight that 
once had to be performed covertly, and a 
Good Samaritan law would only reinforce 
their highly questionable authority. For 
those of you who dont feel personally threat
ened by the War on Drugs, this is only one 
example of the potential abuses such a law 
could legitimize. What if the well-cultivated 
fear of terrorism filling the newspapers 
today evolved into a full-blown witch hunt 
a few years down the road? Fifty years ago, 
with a particularly infamous incarnation of 
the Good Samaritan law in effect, similarly 
improvable charges could bring down any
one the government chose to brand a Com
munist. The label was so flexible, and the 
system so thoroughly corrupt, that wellconnected businessmen occasionally made 
use of it to attack their decidedly un-Communistic competitors.
All of which isnt to say that David Cash, 
the killers friend, didnt in fact break the 
law. His involvement with the guilty party 
should be intently analyzed to see if he 
acted as an accessory to the crime. How
ever, if no evidence of collaboration is avail
able, the issue cannot be pursued any fur
ther. When a particularly odious and wellpublicized case comes to light, and a person 
condemned in the public eye is released 
unscathed, were left with a feeling that 
justice hasnt been carried out. But rashly 
tampering with the innermost mechanics 
of our legal system creates the potential for 
injustice on a far greater scale.

It is absolutely unacceptable peals to the administration, but six-phase gym renovation, and

Tennis team wins 
pair of matches
The CMU womens tennis team has been 
unstoppable so far this season. Last Satur
day, they convincingly defeated both 
Chatham and Division II Shippensburg 
at home.
The first game, against cross-town oppo
nent Chatham, was expectedly non-competitive. The Tartans took all three doubles 
matches easily. Senior Keri Mills and sopho
more Elisabeth Brown swept their doubles 
component 8-0, and the other two Tartan 
pairs won 8-2.
Domination continued in the singles 
matches as CMU swept all six matches in 
two sets. They finished the match with a 
perfect 9-0 score.
Shippensburg proved more of a challenge 
for the Tartans. CMU lost two of three 
doubles matches for the first time this year. 
However, they came back strong for the 
singles. Mills, Brown, freshmen Jill Palermo 
and Kelly Chanopas, and senior Julie Balch 
all won their respective sets, giving the 
Tartans five out of a possible six points in 
the singles. That was enough to erase the
doubles disappointment, and CMU won the 
match against Shippensburg.
The team plays Washington and Jefferson 
at home on Monday before traveling to the 
Flower City Tournament in Rochester.
Home court proves 
beneficial for men
The mens tennis team started its season off 
strong this Wednesday by defeating Allegh
eny College in a dual match at home.
The day did not start off well, as Allegheny 
stole two of three doubles matchs from the 
Tartans. However, the team stepped it up in 
the singles matches.
Senior Dean Ho, junior Apurva Kothari, 
and sophomore Sameer Ker each won their 
respective matches. The days drama was 
provided by sophomore Chanakya Oza.
At the time, Camgie Mellon and Allegheny 
were tied at three points each, and Oza was 
competing for the decidingpoint. After splitting 
the first two sets, Oza found himself down 0-5 
in the final set. Facing elimanation, he won 
seven straight games, taking the set and giving 
CMU the final point needed to win.
The team plays next Saturday at the Flower 
City Tournament in Rochester.

Victories put womens soccer squad on track
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
This wek, Carnegie Mellons 
womens soccer team rebounded from 
their 0-2 weekend at the Allegheny 
Tournament, moving their record first 
to 1-2 and finally to 3-2.
Last Wednesday, the team trav
eled to Allegheny once more, this time 
to actually play Allegheny, and won 
3-0. Three days after the win, the 
Tartans played their first home game 
of the season against UAA opponent 
Case Western Reserve University.
I think we were definitely tired in 
the game on Sunday, and that played 
a role in our loss, said Junior Romy 
Fischer. We have made a collective 
decision to up the intensity in prac
tice significantly in order to increase 
our team endurance and to avoid the 
kind of fatigue we faced on Sunday.
The Tartans earned their first goal 
with 20 minutes left in the first half. 
Freshman Gwyneth Gaul headed in a 
comer kick from first-year student 
Marcy Cook to give CMU the lead.
With time winding down in the first 
half, the team earned a direct kick while 
pressing offensively 25 yards out from 
the Allegheny goal. Gaul took the free 
kick and placed it high into an upper 
corner and out of reach of the Allegheny 
goalie to give Carnegie Mellon a 2-0 
lead with four minutes left in the half.
CMU capitalized on their first-half mo
mentum early in the second half. Sopho
more Kari Pylyphyshyn split the defense 
with a pass that first-year student Ashley 
Wermine recieved and shot into the far 
comer of the net past the goalie.
Despite winning 3-0, the team was 
outshot by Allegheny 22-10, and gave 
up seven corner kicks while only earn
ing two for themselves.
Last Saturdays game against Case 
Western proved a tougher match for 
the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon was able to control 
the ball for most of the game, and did 
earn some scoring chances. Senior 
Lindsay Smith spent much of the game 
alone in CMUs end of the field be
cause of the control the Tartans were 
able to maintain.
The last few minutes of the game 
produced a flurry of action in front of 
the Case Western goal. Carnegie Mellon 
was able to launch a number of shots 
which just failed to go in the net.
At the end of regulation, the score 
was still 0-0. Carnegie Mellon had 
dominated the game, and it was visible 
from the hanging heads of the Case 
Western players. Unfortunately, the 
team would now have to play sudden 
death overtime.
In overtime, Carnegie Mellon contin
ued to control the ball and the game. 
The offense seemed to pick up the pace, 
and replaced hesitation and a tendency 
to put one too many touches on the ball 
before shooting with more aggressive 
play and quicker shots.
Moments later, Gaul recieved a cross
field pass 30 yards from the Case West
ern goal. She turned with the ball and 
let a shot go that cruised over the goalie 
and into the back of the net.
The teams record now stands at 3-2. 
Their next game is against Chatham at 
home before UAA powerhouse Wash
ington University comes to CMU.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  14 September 19989
Amazing home run race 
captivates baseball fans
By RICH TORIO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
September 8,1998,8:18 pm CT 
 it was not one of his trademark 
Big-Mac-Land blasts; it was not 
one of his 500-foot whoppers. It 
was not one of his lofty, Ruthian 
home runs that hang in the heav
ens and in our imaginations. 
Sixty-two was a line-shot, his 
shortest of the season. If you 
i blinked, you missed it. It was, by 
L distance, anticlimactic.
But what made last Tuesday 
unforgettable was not about how 
( long it flew. It was not just a 
; future Trivial Pursuit question,
| or stat candy for number-crazed 
baseball fans. It was not just 
; about Babe Ruth, and Roger 
Maris, and Cooperstown. WhatI
 made that night unforgettable 
was a man, a great, great man, 
named Mark McGwire.
It was his catharsis. In the 
fourth inning, against Steve 
Traschel, McGwire drove the ball 
to left field. Uncertain if it would 
clear the wall, his eyes followed 
the ball as he trotted towards 
first. As the ball disappeared over 
the fence, the 6 foot 5 inch, 245- 
pound giant became a kid again, 
jumping for joy and leaping over 
first base. As if he were still a 
little-leaguer, the first-base coach 
reminded McGwire to touch the 
bag. All smiles, he turned around, 
touched the base, and resumed 
his trip into the record books.
The characteristically stoic 
McGwire rightfully celebrated 
this home run. Rounding the 
bases, he high-fived opposing 
Cubs, and they approvingly pat
ted him on his rear as he passed. 
The first of the many hugs
McGwire gave out on this lovefilled night went to the Cubs third 
baseman, Gary Gaetti, his former 
teammate. Bashing forearms 
with his third-base coach, 
McGwire headed home, pointing 
up to the heavens, to the man 
upstairs, as he calls him. The 
atmosphere was jubilant; his en
tire Cardinals team waited for 
him at home plate.
McGwire touched home, and 
fought through the crowd to find 
the one person he wanted to share 
the moment with: his son, 
Mathew. He lifted Mathew high 
above his head, and looked up at 
him with his smiling blue eyes as 
if to say, we did it. Placing his 
son back down, McGwire turned 
to his teammates and allowed 
them to mob him with their con
gratulations. As if to not let his 
son feel left out, he emerged from 
the giant group hug once more to 
bear hug Mathew, planting a kiss 
on his lips.
McGwire turned his son loose, 
and rejoined his teammates, re
joicing. Cardinal congratulations 
ranged from fanny-pats, to fore
arm bashes, to heartfelt hugs. 
Everyone had a chance to share 
his moment in history.
Even Sammy Sosa, the Cubs 
outfielder and fellow pursuant of 
Maris mark, ran in from right 
field to pay homage to the new 
home run king. The sky erupted 
with fireworks as these two ti
tans of the game embraced. Halfjokingly, half-sincere they shared 
each others trademark home rim 
rituals: fists hitting in the air and 
mock punches to the gut, finger
tip kisses, and touching of hearts. 
It was a moment of moments in 
this momentous night, mutual
respect expressed in this ex
change of customs.
As McGwire had shared the 
night with his pursuant, Sosa, 
so did he share it with the man 
he passed. McGwire ran from 
home plate to the first-base line. 
He climbed over the railing into 
the stands, to the seats of the 
late Roger Maris family. 
Though McGwire could not 
physically embrace Maris, he 
could not have possibly shown 
more respect for the man; 
McGwire gave out hugs five
fold, embracing or kissing each 
of the five Maris children.
The celebration raged on for 
10 minutes. Ovations erupted 
in stadiums, sports bars, and 
family rooms across the coun
try. Millions of spectators 
watched this giant achieve im
mortality with one swing of the 
bat. Mark McGwires 62nd home 
run would never be forgotten.
Mark McGwire, the man, is 
what we fans of the game will 
never forget about that night of 
Tuesday, September 8, 1998. 
We will never forget the man 
who skipped past first base in 
jubilation. We will never forget 
the man who group-hugged the 
Maris clan. We will never for
get the man who traded mock 
punches and air kisses with 
Sammy Sosa. And we will never 
forget the man who hoisted his 
son into the air, the greatest of 
his trophies, and kissed him, 
for the world to see. Your record 
may be broken some day, Mark 
McGwire, but you will never be 
forgotten. Tony La Russa, 
McGwires long-time manager, 
said it best: He is a better 
person than he is a player.

took one touch on the ball, and 
then let a shot go that beat the 
Penn State-Behrend goalie low 
to the far corner.
Two minutes after Jones 
notched his first of the season, 
Tepper broke through the defense 
using raw speed and determina
tion to beat the defenders in a 
one-on-one foot race and chip the 
ball over the maligned Penn 
State-Behrend goalie.
The guy opened up, said 
Tepper. I looked up and he gave 
me the lane, so I took it.
Teppers goal locked the Tar
tans into a 3-0 lead for most of the 
remainder of the game. With only 
12 minutes left in the game, Brody 
was pulled down in the box, and 
Carnegie Mellon was awarded a 
penalty kick. Tepper took it, and 
set the final score at 4-0.
I think that our 
team chemistry is fi
nally gelling, said 
Jones after the game.
The team would need 
to prove itself against 
a more powerful oppo
nent before it could be 
certain, though. 
Saturdays game 
against Case Western 
provided that opportu
nity to them.
The team went into 
the Case Western 
game looking to even 
its record out and earn 
an important win in 
the UAA. Within the 
first 30 minutes of the 
game, both teams 
scored a goal. The 1-1 
tie held for most of the 
game. CMU was able 
to control the ball and 
the tempo for most of 
the game, and earned 
some chances to score,
but also gave up some chances to 
Case Western. Without the solid 
play of junior goalie Ben 
Kartzman, Case Western might 
have taken the lead.
The physical nature of the 
game took its toll on the flow, 
as three yellow cards were 
given out. Two went to Case 
Western players and one to 
Carnegie Mellon.
The game took on a more fran
tic pace as the end of regulation 
approached. Carnegie Mellon was 
able to force the ball deep into 
Case Western territory, but the 
team was unable to score.
Finally, with two minutes re
maining in the game, the Case 
Western goalie was called for a 
pass back violation because he 
used his hands on the ball when 
a player from his own team passed 
the ball to him.
Carnegie Mellon was awarded 
an indirect kick near the right 
hand corner of Case Westerns 
end of the field. The kick did noil 
yield a shot on net, but did result 
in a corner kick.
Off of the corner kick, sopho-! 
more Dave Zupon leapt into the 
air and headed the ball toward 
the goal. The shot was blocked 
and came back to Zupon, who 
was on the ground. He headed 
the ball again and again the shod 
was blocked, only this time the 
ball came to Ulrich, who was stilt 
standing up.
Ulrich shot the ball. After bounc-i 
ing off of several Case Western 
players the ball went into the net!
The remaining minute and a 
half was a formality for the mens 
team, which now owns a 2-2! 
record after a sluggish 0-2 startj 
to the season.

exceptional, nearly flawless volleyball. They traded 
points for the first half of the game, and the score 
was 7-7. Wooster came through with good serving, 
followed by a few errors by CMU, and the score

Junior Beth Sekowski then helped turn the mo

junior Rachelle Abati dominated the Lady Scots with 
flawless serves as CMU came from behind to win the

The victory put the Tartans on a roll as the clean

into the second game. Momentum is huge in these 
i games, especially when you have a young team like 
i we do, said Webb. With the score 9-4, Sekowski 
! finished a long volley with a strong slam that seemed 
to frustrate the Wooster opponents. They would not 
score again, and the Tartans went on to a 15-4 victory 
in the game and a 2-0 lead in the match.

The womens volleyball team 
celebrates a point in their comback 
win. The victory came In game five 
against Wooster College during the 
quad matches in the UC gym.
Wooster came on strong in the next game, though, ancj 
Carnegie Mellon began to show signs of fatigue. They fel) 
behind 2-6 early, and Wooster didnt look back. Tough playj 
was not enough to edge the Tartans over Wooster, and the}) 
fell 15-5.
The team tried to regain momentum in the fourth game but* 
despite holding an early 3-0 lead, allowed the Lady Scots to ti^ 
the match with a 15-7 win.
The fifth game seemed to come down to whoever wanted i| 
more. Both teams showed clear signs of slowing down. Wheij 
youre tired, its not only physically draining, but its hard t(J 
keep mentally focused, said Webb.
Freshmen Anushka Nethisinghe and Sara Lechleitnej 
combined with Szobota and Putaro to keep the Tartans clostj 
early. Numerous changes of possession and exceptional def 
fense on both sides of the ball kept the score tight and th(J 
game dramatic.
CMU finally broke away from Wooster when the score was 9-j
11 in favor of the Lady Scots. On the strength of exceptional 
serving and relentless blocking, the team scored six unanjswered points to win the game 15-11 and the match 3-2.
This is the best team Ive seen in a long time, said Webb, j
The team will ride the wave of their victory into Skibo Gyrr|

While the average CMU stu
dent was deep in slumber, a few 
athletic individuals were up with 
the sun this past Sunday morn
ing for the 11th annual Carnegie 
Mellon Triathlon. Participants
in the event* were required to 
swim 500 yards, bike 10 miles, 
and run 3.1 miles both in teams 
or individually.
I wanted to create an event 
that would make people stay a 
little healthier over the summer, 
said Donna Morosky, the 
triathlon coordinator and CMU

fitness and athletic director. 
Morosky wanted people to return 
to school physically fit, so she 
planned an intense triathlon for 
early in the school year.
Some members of the CMU 
swim team gathered together to 
participate in the event. Senior 
biology major Jennifer Skully 
and senior civil engineering ma
jor Michelle Kondo teamed up 
with graduate student Matt Moe 
to take first place in the CMU 
coed team category. Its motiva
tion to stay in shape through the 
summer. It was fun doing it with 
a team. Your team members are 
counting on you, said Kondo, 
who swam the 500 yards during 
the triathlon.
Moe, who has participated in 
the event for the past five years, 
was the bicyclist for the team. I 
just love to compete, he said.
Glen Dubin, a graduate stu
dent in the Heinz School, also 
participated in this years 
triathlon. Ive done these for fun. 
I think the people were friendly. 
Everyone helped each other out 
and cheered us on, he said.
It creates camaraderie be
tween team members, said Bader 
Al-Essa, a graduate student in 
mechanical engineering who was 
on a team with students affili
ated with the Student Life Office.
This year, the event had its 
largest turnout with nearly 180 
individuals participating, up from 
last years 130 participants. Al
though the triathlon started over
a decade ago as an event for CMU 
students exclusively, the event 
has been open to members of the 
Pittsburgh community and sur
rounding areas for several years 
now. According to Morosky, 50 
percent of the participants are 
CMU students and the other half 
are community members. There 
are two categories of winners, 
those that are CMU students and 
others that are non-CMU. The 
winners are further divided by 
age group, gender, and whether 
the participants are in a team or 
racing individually.
[The Triathlon has] changed 
in the percentage of partici
pants. Now there are more 
teams participating and firsttimers, said Morosky.
For students from CMU, the 
cost of participating in the 
triathlon is discounted from $25 
to $15 due to a subsidy from the 
Student Activities Fee. A por
tion of the proceeds from this 
years race will go to the DePaul 
Institution, which aids the deaf 
and blind.
I dont want to say the event 
runs itself, said Morosky. Orga
nizing the volunteers, coordinat
ing the road closing with the city 
of Pittsburgh for race day, and 
advertising the event are all part 
of Moroskys responsibilities.
All her effort was worthwhile, 
however, as this years event, with 
perfect weather, a large number 
of participants, and lots of school 
spirit, was an incredible success.

Enthusiasm, excitement, and anxiety were at a 
boiling point last Saturday in the University Center 
Gym as the womens volleyball team hosted their first 
quad match of the season. The Tartans battled Wooster 
College, University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown (UPJ), 
and Waynesburg College in a round-robin of best of 
five matches.
The team came in looking to better their fifth place 
finish out of nine at the Kenyon Tournament last week
end. They succeeded.
We played smarter, more aggressive games, said head 
coach Julie Webb. Were coming together as a team.
Teamwork was evident from the start of the day. 
Waynesburg, considered to be the weakest of the days 
competition, was Carnegie Mellons first opponent. The 
Tartans took only three games to finish off the Yellow 
Jackets, aided by the strong play of juniors Stephanie 
Szobota and Sarah Putaro.
Next up was UPJ. Again, the Tartans enthusiasm, 
precise hitting, and defense dominated.
Defensively, no one can beat us, said Webb. As far 
as players go, we werent really better than the other 
teams. The reason why they lose is that they dont 
support each other, while we have great team play.
The work paid off, and the team continued its win
ning streak, winning 15-3, 15-6, and 15-5 in three 
straight games.
As the Tartans were racking up wins, their final 
opponents were putting on an equally impressive dis
play. The Wooster Lady Scots equaled CMUs feat of six
wins in six games and the stage was set for the days best match.
With both teams coming off huge waves of momentum from 
the earlier contests, the noise in the UC gym quickly escalated, 
along with the level of play. In game one, both teams played

What would Saturday be without the 
weekly CMU football squeaker? After 
last weeks painful overtime loss to 
Denison, 20-21, the Tartans deserved 
a game without unnecessary suspense 
 preferably, a win. But last Saturday 
againstfello w UAA member Case West
ern Reserve University Spartans, the 
game was once again decided in the 
closing minutes. What else would you 
expect from a meeting between the 
Spartans and the Tartans?
The first three quarters of the game 
was a war of attrition. The Tartans 
were winning the misleading battle of 
time of possession, but losing the war 
on the scoreboard. Despite the offense 
moving the ball fairly consistently, 
the Tartans had no points to show for 
their efforts. Despite the CMU de
fense playing inspired football, Case 
Western managed one score, a touch
down. And just into the fourth quar
ter, the Spartans held the lead, 7-0.
The ball was spotted on the Carnegie 
Mellon 15-yard line. Down seven, with
the clock winding down, these are the 
moments that define a team. No stranger 
to fourth-quarter comebacks, junior 
quarterback Russ Clay led the CMU 
offense to the line of scrimmage. With 85 
yards between the ball and a tie, they 
began to drive. Methodically, the of
fense marched down the field, deter
mined to score. Outsmarting the Spar
tans, the Tartans engineered an equal
izing 85-yard touchdown drive. Fifthyear senior Matt Jarock tacked on the 
extra point, and the game was tied 7-7. 
With seven minutes left to play, the 
game was far from over.
Case Western Reserve then took the 
kickoff, and the Spartans started a drive 
of their own. The momentum shifted back 
to the Spartan side, as their offense pushed 
into Tartan territory. First and 10 on the 
CMU 44-yard line, the Spartans looked 
poised to score. For the next three plays, 
they averaged 3 yards a play. The ball 
rested on the Carnegie Mellon 35, the 
longest yard between the football and a 
Spartan first down. Out of field goal range, 
the Spartans had to go for it.
The ball was snapped; the Spartan 
line surged forward; the Spartan
backfield headed for the hole. But sopho
more nosetackle Rashad Gray met the 
ball carrier at the point of attack. Blow 
on my bagpipes  that was a big play! 
The Tartans held on fourth down anc 
regained the ball on their own 35, with 
about two minutes left to play.
The Carnegie Mellon offense took the 
field again. Riding the momentum o: 
that defensive stand, the Tartans dartec 
down the field. They would not be de
nied. Clay led the charge and put the 
nail in the coffin. Only 65 yards later 
the Tartans deservedly claimed theii 
touchdown and victory. Final score: Tar
tans 14, Spartans 7.
We played with heart, tenacity, anc 
we won, said Gray after the game. We 
had to pull it out of ourselves.
Head coach Rich Lackner agreed 
Both sides of the ball stepped it up.
What would Saturday be without the 
weekly CMU football squeaker? Boring 
in comparison. There is never a dull mo
ment for the Tartan football team. Get 
your kilts on sports fans, the home openei 
is this Saturday! I cant guarantee a-win 
but I am pretty sure it will be close. Cheei 
these men on; they deserve it.

someone must have lit a match. The

game on Wednesday against Penn StateBehrend 4-0 and outplayed UAA oppo
nent Case Western Reserve University 
for most of last Saturdays contest before 
breaking a 1-1 tie with less than a minute 
to go in the game to earn a win.
Maybe it was coach Nick Gaudioso 
who turned the gas on for the team. 
After its second straight loss, Gaudioso 
began making moves. Brody was moved 
from the inside midfielder position to 
the outside, and first-year student 
Steve Tepper was moved from the out
side to the inside. Both players liked 
the move.
I think that Coach knows what hes 
doing, and I always used to play outside 
mid, said Brody. I hope that I will be
Finally, with only 12 minutes left before 
halftime, Carnegie Mellon pushed the 
ball past the goal line and gave the 
Tartans their first lead of the season.
The goal came in when the ball was 
crossed into the middle where it was 
deflected by the Penn State-Behrend 
goalie. Senior co-captain Harry Ulrich 
buried the ball into the back of the net 
when it bounced in front of him, giving 
the team a 1-0 lead.
The team finished the half with only 
that one goal; however, the first five 
minutes of the second half were all that 
CMU needed to end any doubt as to who 
was going to win.
Only three minutes into the half, 
Ulrich fed junior forward Doug Jones 
the ball along the 18-yard line. Jones

able to smoke some people and cross the 
ball into the box.
I love [the change], said Tepper. I 
used to play there. You get a lot more 
touches on the ball. Its really exciting. 
Gaudioso also began pushing players 
harder in practice, and on Wednesday 
the team came out looking like it wanted 
to prove something.
Carnegie Mellon outplayed Penn 
State-Behrend for the entire first half. 
The team created a number of opportu
nities for itself, but was unable to finish.

Cs for Carnegie, thats 
good enough for me....
Last Thursday evening in 
Rangos Hall, the Childrens 
Television Workshop brought 
Sesame Street Unpaved, a 
celebration of 30 years of suc
cess of the childrens pro
gram Sesame Street, to 
CMU. Over 400 CMU stu
dents, faculty, and staff, as 
well as visitors from the 
Pittsburgh community, came 
to see the unprecedented 
behind-the-scenes view of 
Sesame Street.
The presentation was 
designed primarily for col
lege students, especially 
television, film, education, 
and communication majors. 
It provided a chance to learn 
more about the educational 
mandates, animation, story
telling, and other compo
nents that contribute to the 
development of each show.
 Sesame Street Unpaved 
is a way for us to give [some
thing] back to you, those who 
grew up watching Sesame 
Street, said Rosemarie 
Truglio, director of research 
for Sesame Street and the 
moderator for the evening.
I just felt it was the kind 
of program that would have 
broad appeal, said Anne 
Witchner, assistant dean of
Student Affairs, who had 
been planning since April to 
bring the program to CMU. 
The appeal is so great  
from a student who is the 
avid TV viewer, to the stu
dent who wants to do this as 
a career.
Last Thursdays program 
featured a question-andanswer panel of four mem
bers who work with Sesame 
Street in different capacities. 
One member of the panel 
was Steve Whitmire, a prin
cipal puppeteer with The 
Jim Henson Company. Whit
mire joined the company in 
1978, almost right out of 
high school.
I was just an obsessive 
fan, who was fortunate 
enough to have it channel 
into a career, said Whitmire.
With the death of Jim 
Henson, he began the puppeteering of characters such 
as Kermit the Frog and 
Ernie. During Sesame 
Street Unpaved, Whitmire 
and Kermit the Frog enter
tained the audience, as Ker
mit made jokes and faces 
and exhibited well-known 
quirks as he sat in Whit
mires lap.
During the time for open 
questions from the audience, 
Maria Renzelli, a 1997 grad
uate of the University of 
Pittsburgh, shared with the 
panel and audience her story
of the day her mother went 
into labor and her thenthree-year-old sister told her 
mom she wanted the baby 
named Maria since Maria 
on Sesame Street was really 
pretty and really nice.
I have been told that 
story every birthday for as 
long as I can remember, 
said Renzelli. Meeting the 
real Maria was something I 
never thought Id do.
The audience was very 
responsive. They sang along 
with well-known Sesame 
Street songs and laughed at 
familiar episodes  the pro
gram closed with a 20-minute 
clip video of the past 30 years 
of the show. At the end of the 
presentation, all those in 
attendance received a 
Sesame Street character doll.
I think that it was very 
successful and am pleased 
that we were able to bring 
this event to campus, said 
Witchner.
Students from all majors, 
from drama and musical 
composition to engineering 
and education, attended the 
program for various reasons.
My older sister actually 
saw the first episode of 
Sesame Street. It is a mix of 
personal and professional 
reasons [for] being here, 
said Chris Cummings, a 
senior drama major interest
ed in television production.
Louis Ransom, a firstyear student in H&SS, was 
also a student in the audi
ence, but to him the pro
gram had a different mean
ing. When Ransom was four 
years old, he began playing 
the part of one of the chil
dren on Sesame Street, 
which he played for a year 
and a half.
My dad worked at the 
Pittsburgh Courier, and they 
took pictures of me which 
were sent out to talent agen
cies and modeling agencies, 
said Ransom. The pictures 
not only landed him audi
tions in various commer
cials, but also an audition for 
Sesame Street.
Ransom remembered how 
before the shows he would 
get to play with the other 
kids. He had the opportuni
ty to work with the actors 
and actresses, as well as the 
puppeteers. According to 
Ransom, they were each 
given a couple of lines and 
were always told to be 
themselves, be vibrant, be 
talkative, and just have a 
good time.
It makes me feel real 
proud that I got to be a part 
of it, said Ransom. Every
body has at least one memo
ry from a Sesame Street 
episode. Its amazing to see 
that one show has touched 
so many people.

Sonia Manzano is better known as Maria to a whole 
generation of people who have grown up watching Sesame 
Street. Manzano has played this role on the shows cast 
since its third season. In addition to acting, she writes 
scripts for the show and 
has won 12 Emmy Awards 
for her writing. Before 
Sesame Street, however,
Manzano once traversed 
the CMU campus as a 
student. Last Thursday, 
she came back to CMU as 
a part of Sesame Street 
Unpaved,  a national 10- 
campus panel tour that 
is a part of Sesame 
Street's 30tli anniver
sary. Before the show,
The Tartan had an 
opportunity to speak 
with Manzano.
The Tartan: How 
does it feel to be back 
at CMU?
Sonia Manzano: I 
was back here a cou
ple of years ago, and I 
was surprised at how 
sad I felt. I was a lit
tle depressed that 
Skibo isnt here any
more because that 
was part of my life. It 
was Morewood,
Skibo, Doherty. The 
Cut was a center of 
activity, and there 
were a lot of frisbees 
and frisbee-catching 
dogs. And it rained 
on every Thursday 
all the time I 
was here. Crossing 
the Cut during 
the winter was 
also miserable.
TT: Tell me a 
little bit about 
your life here as 
a student.
SM: I didnt 
graduate from 
here. During my 
junior year, we 
did a show called 
Godspell. A grad 
student named 
John Michael 
Tebalack pro...
duced it. It was ny a/Tartan Photo Editor
a very odd show 
where we were all dressed up as 
clowns and threw trash at each other.
Then John moved to New York City, and he wanted us to 
join him at an avant-garde theater there, so I went there, 
and I was going to get credit for doing the show. The show 
was big in New York and eventually made it to Broadway. 
Its hard to imagine a show going from a drama school pro
duction to Broadway.
TT: How did you get started with Sesame Street?
SM: Its not a great story. An agent saw me in Godspell 
and told me there may be a spot for me in Sesame Street. 
So I went and auditioned.
But the thing Ill never forget is the first time I saw 
Sesame Street. I saw it at the student center in Skibo. I saw 
James Earl Jones reciting the alphabet. Then I saw Burt 
Lancaster with numbers flashing over his head as he was 
saying them. I thought, What the hell is this all about? Is 
this for deaf people?
At that time, you didnt see that many black people on 
TV. I was absolutely impressed by the show. It was really 
in your face. This was the first time people of color were 
doing a kids show.
TT: Youve been on the show for many years. What have 
been your favorite moments over this time?
SM: Ive had the opportunity of meeting people like Ste
vie Wonder, Ray Charles, and Tony Bennett. 
Theyve been great moments because when I was 
a little kid, I saw those people on television. Now, 
you see them again, and you remember what is was 
like the first time you saw them on TV.

When Ryan Moskal looks at a barrel 
of oil, he doesn't see the black stuff 
spilled by the Valdez near Alaska  he 
sees a steel drum waiting to be made. 
The sophomore electrical and computer 
engineering major is the founder of 
Carnegie Steel, a 17-member steel drum 
band which hopes to make its perfor
mance debut at CMU in the near future. 
The Tartan caught up with Moskal yes
terday afternoon to talk about pans, 
the music, and the spirit associated 
with them.
The Tartan: What originally got you 
interested in steel drums?
Ryan Moskal'. At my high school, 
there was a steel drum band. During a 
cultural festival, I saw the band play
ing for the first time; I had heard of 
their performances but never seen one. 
I was just watching them, and I noticed 
that everyone was having a good time. 
The music was lively and energetic, 
and I thought, This is something I 
have to do.
So the following week, I signed up, 
and I ended up playing in the steel 
band my senior year. I wish I had 
signed up earlier  I had a fantastic 
time and learned a lot.
TT: Can you tell me a little about the 
drums themselves?
RM: There are many different types 
of steel drums; our band will have six 
different kinds to get the high range, 
the low range, and all the notes in 
between. The notes available vary 
according to which instrument is being 
played.
As far as putting the notes on, all the 
instruments are done pretty much the 
same way. You start with a 5 5-gallon oil 
drum, like one Exxon would use. The
Chow down...
drum is pounded down 
to make the top surface 
concave with a sixpound sledgehammer.
Then, the drum is 
fired. This changes the 
quality of the steel and 
makes the notes more 
resonant. After firing, 
the individual notes 
are etched into the pan 
and tuned.
A lot of people think it 
is just one big surface 
and you just need to 
know where to hit it to 
get a certain pitch. That 
is partially true, but 
there are definite divi
sions between the notes.
TT: What do you 
think about while you 
are performing?
RM: I like to memo
rize my music. It is a Ryan Mskal 
bad habit, and as a music typically 
result, I do not sight read very well.
I think about the music coming up 
next, and about performing, about hav
ing a good time  and showing the 
audience that I am having a good time.
That is what this band will be about: 
having a good time performing. Back in 
high school, my band director was a 
very stoic man and did not embellish 
very much. This band is going to try to 
get a little more audience interaction
 just a little something beyond play
ing notes for a crowd.
TT: 'What was your most memorable 
performance, and why?
RM: During Orientation 1998  
when I was an Orientation counselor
 there was a steel band on the CFA 
patio after convocation. I checked with 
them, and they played in the same key 
as I did. So I asked if I could join
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor

associated with steel drums.
them, and they said, Sure! Grab a 
pan, and I jumped in. We played 
Margaritaville and Rant and Rave, 
which was one of my favorite songs  
it is very lively and fits right in with 
the calypso spirit.
When I really felt like I had become a 
musician, though, was in a jazz compe
tition on March 1, 1997. We had been 
practicing really hard  our instructor 
had been berating and belittling us to 
practice and do well. When we got 
there, we were all real nervous, espe
cially the leads.
But we nailed all the songs  and 
they were hard songs, too  but we hit 
them right on the money. We got a 
superior and an excellent rating for 
that perfomance, and I remember 
thinking then that the band had finally 
come of age, as we had several new
players. It is a neat sensation when 
everything falls into place.
I also got an outstanding soloist 
rating for the that performance, so in 
addition to being good for the band, it 
was also an ego booster for myself.
TT: What would you say to people 
interested in learning to play?
RM: So many people have come up 
and expressed interest; I would love to 
have enough instruments and enough 
time to help them learn how to play. 
Unfortunately, I also need to get 
degree. I will make as many spaces 
available as possible. For now, we are 
full, but once we get rolling, Twill take 
stock in the situation and see if we can 
have a rotation of people wanting to 
play and learning to play.
People who are interested should by 
all means let me know, and when we 
start playing  hopefully soon  
come out and see what we are all 
about. I think that people who were 
somewhat interested before will 
become really interested.
TT: What do you like most about steel 
drums and steel drum music?
RM: A lot of things! First, not many 
people know what steel drums are or 
how they are played. I get asked ques
tions like, How do skins stretched 
across a drum make a sound like that? 
but steel drums are completely differ
ent  they are hammered in, and the 
whole thing is actually steel.
It is a versatile instrument, good for 
playing all sorts of music, though it is 
most famous for calypso. The songs 
are extremely lively and energetic, 
and it is fun to get into a groove when 
you are playing  swaying back and 
forth and getting into it. It is also an 
exotic instrument; that adds mystery 
to it all.
And, I have a really good excuse to 
buy flowered shirts.

Actress reflects on Sesame Street's success
MARIA, from page LI
TT: Among those famous people, did 
you get to meet Jim Henson?
SM: Yes, of course. Its so tragic that 
hes not with us anymore. It wasnt that 
he was on Sesame Street, but 
his sensibility of the show, his zaniness, 
lived through the show and the Muppets. The one-track mind of each Muppet is a product of his sensibility.
Before Jim, puppets were something 
you learned in history class from 
medieval times. And then Jim came 
along with a fresh sense of puppeteering. Muppets werent used to talk down 
to kids; he used them to open up con
versations with kids. He never used 
them in a condescending manner. He 
gave many gifts to many people.
"Before Jim [Henson], puppets were some
thing you learned about in history class.... 
He used [Muppets] to open up conversations 
with kids.
 Sonia Manzano
TT: Did you think Sesame Street 
would ever be this big?
SM: No. I remember that we 
thought we were going to go for 
another year or two. But now, the 
show has been going on for 30 years. 
Its a unique thing. Its almost an 
American institution.
The Beatles were formed when four 
people got together at a particular time 
in history. The same thing happened 
with Sesame Street when Joe Raposo, 
Jon Stone, Jim Henson, and Jim Moss 
got together. Joe wrote these songs that 
were so simple and good that you could 
sing along.
TT: What do you think of the Purnell 
Center for the Arts?
SM: I think its going to be a great 
thing. But let me tell you, great things 
have happened in that studio theater.
TT: What is it like for adults to: come 
up to you and tell you that they have 
fond childhood memories of you and the 
show?
SM: Its great. I think people meet me, 
and they tget all emotional. Its not 
because Im on TV, but its because they 
watched me as a kid on their moms lap. 
And now theyre in their 20s, and they 
still watch it with their kids.
Im really glad that Latin children 
have the opportunity to watch a Latin 
actress on TV. I didnt have that oppor
tunity as a kid.

Hackers play new lead role in political activism
The Geek Beat

the face with one of the muchhyped realities of a netted cul
ture: The Internet is one of the 
major forms of communication 
and information dissemination 
in the industrialized world. Not 
only did people turn to the 
Net in unprecedented numbers 
in search of data  MCI Inter
connect Gateway, which links 
the White House to the Internet, 
counted between 20 and 30 mil

courtesy Anti-Online
The hacker group milwOrm broke into many different Web sites, 
replacing front pages with nuclear protest pages like the one above.
in your dominant cultural para
digm, you had to go through a 
huge hassle of sit-ins and plac
ard-holding marches where 
passersby look at you like 
youre crazy. Those were the 
ways to get your message out: 
You had to be loud (and prefer
ably dressed in tie-dye) if you 
wanted the powers that be to 
notice you.
ernment saw the Net as the 
proper and effective way to dis
tribute official information. In 
addition, other types of media 
(namely, newspapers and TV 
news reporting) gave the Net 
coverage in their reports. Stories 
about bit rate and router perfor
mance ran side-by-side with the 
gory details of President Clinton 
and his cigar, and with these
things, the Net became legit
imized as the tool of those bas
tions of un-geekiness: the gov
ernment and traditional media 
sources.
Now, enter the geeks.
Combine those who trail 
behind technology  specifical
ly, the various governments 
around the world  with a pub
lic who has expropriated one of 
the major outputs of the geek 
culture and throw in the politi
cally active people who have 
been using the Internet since it 
was Arpanet. Consider the fact 
that in a world of almost six bil
lion people, its pretty difficult to 
get your message heard unless 
you do something extreme.
So try hacking: Whether its 
Indias nuke-making supercom
puters or the Pentagon, the past 
10 months have seen a substan
tial increase in both the preva
lence and visibility of politicallymotivated hacks and cracks. 
Hacking is no longer a game 
played by the curious Net 
junkies that slip through fire
walls just for the sake of experi
ence: It has become the guerilla 
warfare of the information age, 
and with governments depen
dence on digital data, it is just 
as dangerous.
When India tested nukes this 
summer in a pissing contest with 
Pakistan reminiscent of that 50- 
year-long incident commonly 
known as the Cold War, people 
and governments the world over 
protested the decision. But India 
remained intransigent: Despite 
immediate and severe economic 
sanctions from the U.S., Britain, 
France, Germany, Japan, Cana
da, Italy, and Russia, popular 
and official opinion in India 
remained nuke-sympathetic.
So what are technologically 
elite anti-nuke protesters to do 
when the object of derision is a 
nation of almost one billion 
inhabitants a half of a world
away? They do what members 
of cracking group milwOrm did: 
They hack into Indian research 
computers. MilwOrm group 
members identifying them
selves only as JF (from Eng
land), VeNoMouS (from New 
Zeland), and savecOre claimed 
to have cracked into the Bhabha 
Atomic Research Centres 
(BARC) computers, taking data, 
altering the Centers Web page, 
and 
erasing data on two of six 
hacked servers (out of a total of 
eight servers).
It doesnt stop there, though. 
The Boston-based hacker group 
Cult of the Dead Cow is current
ly working on a hack into 
Chinas computer systems in 
protest of Chinas human rights 
violations. Just last Thursday, a 
group of hackers known as the 
Electronic Disturbance Theater 
attempted to stage an online 
sit-in on the Department of 
Defenses Web site in support of 
Mexicos Zapatista rebels. And 
last month, hackers took over 
several Indonesian Web sites, 
covering them with digital graf
fiti that protested human rights 
violations against the Chinese 
in Indonesia.
So give up the nerve gas and 
get yourself a T-3 line: The 
route to getting your messages 
heard, were finding, is to use 
the power of the Net plus the, 
power of hackers brains  
assuming, of course, that you 
dont get caught.

ITS NOT EVERY DAY 
YOU GET A COMPLIMENT 
LIKE THAT.
A II financial companies charge operating Fees 
1. A. and expensessome more than others. Of 
course, the lower the expenses you pay, the better. 
That way, more of your money goes where it 
should towards building a comfortable future.
We make low expenses a top priority.
As the largest retirement system in the 
world'a nonprofit company focused exclu
sively on the financial needs of the educational 
and researcIt communities our expenses are 
among the lowest in the insurance and mutual 
.fund industries.'
In fact, TIAA-CREF's 0.31% average fund 
expenses are less than half of the expense charges 
of comparable funds:5 It's why Morningstar  
one of the nations leading sources of annuity and 
mutual fund information says, "At that level 
[TIAA-CREF] is cheaper than any other
[variable annuity] policy, and is even compet
itive with the cheapest mutual fund complexes, 
though it offers far more benefits.M
TIAA-CREF sets the standard in the 
financial services industry.
Of course, expenses are only one factor to 
consider when you malce an investment decision. 
Morningstar also noted our commitment to 
'consumer^education, service and solid 
investment performance. Because that can 
make a difference in the long run, too.
At TIAA-CREF1, we believe people would 
like to spend more in retirement, not on their 
retirement company. Today, over two million 
people count on that approach to help them 
build a comfortable and secure future. So 
can you. To find out more, call us at

which rhymes with clearing, which is synonymous with clarification, 
which rhymes with obligation, which is synonymous with duty,

Twenty-Four CMU Grads Can't All Be Wrong
There just seems to be something that 
draws CMU grads to FactSet.
Maybe it's the fact that the company is still small enough for 
an individual to make a difference.
Maybe it's because the company offers ample opportunity to 
develop your career.
Maybe it's because it's a fun place to work.
Whatever the reason, if you're motivated, creative, and in the 
market for a good company to work for, FactSet may be the 
place for you.
What does FactSet do?
FactSet is a leading provider of online financial, market, and 
economic information. Our software is used by more than
10,000 investment professionals worldwide to research 
companies, industries, and economies.
The company is totally dedicated to service. We spend a lot of 
time working with the client to make sure the databases we 
create, the software we develop, the support we provide, even 
the manuals and help we write, are meeting or exceeding the 
clients' expectations.
More Information?
FactSet is headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, and has 
offices in Manhattan, San Mateo, London, Tokyo, and 
Hong Kong.
Contact our recruiting coordinator at 203.863.1568 or visit us 
on the web at www.factset.com.
We'll be holding an information session October 14, in Porter 
Hall, Room A18B at 7pm. We'll be interviewing on campus 
October 15. See your placement office for details.
What are we looking for?
FactSet recruits on campus for Software and Systems Engineers, 
Consultants, and Technical Communicators.
Software Engineering
At FactSet, Software Engineers design the databases and applications 
our clients use every day. They work closely with all areas of the 
company to ensure that FactSet's technology is highly responsive to 
the changing needs of the investment community.
We look for experience in one or more of the following: C/C++, GUI 
frameworks, data visualization, Perl/HTML, Microsoft Windows 
application development, algorithmic analysis and design, and 
statistical/quantitative analysis.
Consulting
Consultants are the essential link between the investment 
professional and FactSet's powerful software.
Consultants combine a thorough understanding of the FactSet system 
with a working knowledge of finance and technology to offer an 
unparalleled .level of service.
We consider individuals with backgrounds in finance, accounting, MIS 
as well as the liberal arts and engineering. Personality counts for 
Consultants, so you also need to be comfortable working with people.
Technical Communication
Technical Communicators at FactSet strive to keep clients; prospects, 
and the general public informed about new products, enhancements, 
and corporate developments. For Technical Communicators at FactSet, 
this responsibility could potentially mean working on everything from 
brochures to product specs to press releases to user manuals to 
multimedia training to HTML based online help.
FactSet is currently looking for Technical Communicators who are: 
experienced and skilled authors and editors, organized and attentive 
to detail, highly motivated with excellent interpersonal skills, and 
interested in computers, technology, and finance.

The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania14 September 1998
Techno show engages audience
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
A performance by the Crystal 
Method is not one where youll find 
yourself in a trance, standing in a 
corner, vacantly listening to the snare 
spike of whatever jungle the DJ is 
spinining. But then again, you prob
ably wont be staring at the stage, 
chanting the words to their songs along 
with the rest of the audience. At 
Metropol last Wednesday, the boys 
from Las Vegas put on a show that 
struck a balance between the indi
vidualism of a rave and the attentive
ness of a Barenaked Ladies concert. 
After watching this show, any fan of 
electronic music, expert or otherwise, 
would be convinced that the Crystal 
Method deserves their reputation as 
one of the best live acts in techno.
With all the recent attention and 
hype given to electronic music, 
electrnica, or just techno, decipher
ing the quality acts from the pop-laden 
trend riders is difficult. Much of this 
attention comes from the success of 
European acts such as Prodigy, the 
Chemical Brothers, and Orbital. Many 
have put the Crystal Method, duo Ken 
Jordan and Scott Kirkland, in the same 
category as these groups. Purists know 
that in the quickly-growing glut of 
electronic acts, and even up against 
these foreign powerhouses, a live act 
that can pull this much excitement 
from an audience is rare.
For last Wednesdays show, the Crys
tal Method set up their gear on a 
stripped-down stage, with the excep
tion of two impressive lighting towers. 
Critics of the Crystal Methods live act 
have said that they tend to pop in their 
most recent album, the aptly titled
courtesy Outpost 
The Crystal Method played songs from their latest 
album, Vegas, last Wednesday at Metropol.
Vegas, push a few buttons, and sit back.
In this show, they did play several of 
their most popular songs, including 
Busy Child, the one sophomoric piece 
off that album. Most may know this song 
from the rollerblading sequence in the 
Gap commercial that no one can escape.
Such an accessible use of the song raises 
questions of the life of the Crystal 
Methods music  if the Gap is using it, 
everybody else soon will be listening to 
it, and in the music industry, that can 
only mean death.
Regardless oftheir popularity, though, 
the Crystal Methods music is still unde
niably innovative, and their live show is 
irreplaceable. In fact, it is that popular
ity that makes a show by the Crystal 
Method different and more energetic than 
most other live electronic acts. The audi
ence knows the music, as exemplified by 
last Wednesdays renditions of Keep 
Hope Alive, Now is the Time, and 
Cherry Twist. This fact only helps their 
music, and at Metropol, the vibe filled the 
whole room. Only at a show like this can
you see an entire crowd danc
ing and watching the artist 
on stage, but without the feel 
of, say, a Dave Matthews 
show, as if the DJs are pro
viding a service of music to 
the audience. Despite some 
questionable moments, such 
as Shes My Pusher, the 
crowd of about 400 loved it.
Unlike the shows put on 
by techno artists more wellversed in the flourishing 
rave scene, such as Josh 
Wink or Rabbit in the Moon, 
the Crystal Method vary 
their music enough to keep 
to keep an audience actively 
engaged. Rather than run
ning trance or drum n bass beats for 
hours at a time, holed up at the back of 
a stage among piles of gear, the Crys
tal Method play their mix of trance, 
breakbeat, and trip-hop.
Besides a good mix, the Crystal 
Method used a punchy lighting se
quence as a complement to their music. 
Watching the stage was as fascinating 
as any polished recording artist. These 
two are not just record-spinning D Js  
in Keep Hope Alive, Kirkland jumps 
and punches his synthesizer. These 
guys are not passive, aloof DJs, hiding 
behind hooded sweatshirts.
At the end of the show, they ac
cepted their generous applause gra
ciously. For their encore, they came 
back with Trip Like I Do, which was 
possibly the best moment of the night. 
In this song, and most others, the 
Crystal Method gives a keyboard-toss
ing romp through some of the most 
original techno around, making a show 
that audiences are sure to love, re
gardless of how popular they become.
Film gambles with 
clichd plot twists
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Rounders is one of the funniest movies 
Ive seen in a long time. I spent the 
better part of the movie laughing  at 
the dialogue, at the plot twists, at 
everything.
*
What: Rounders 
Director: John Dahl 
Company: Spanky [Miramax]
Only thing is, it wasnt meant to be 
a comedy.
The movie knows its about Loyalty 
and Taking Risks and Poker as a Meta
phor for Life Itself, and that its subject 
matter is too substantial for it to stop 
taking itself seriously for one instant. 
Which, of course, makes it hilarious.
Matt Damon plays Mike, a New York 
law student who, despite looking like a 
J. Crew model, is an expert poker player. 
After losing his entire tuition in a toorash bet, he vows to give up the game 
and concentrate on his studies and his 
girlfriend (Gretchen Mol). But a few 
months later, his old friend Worm (Ed
ward Norton) gets out of jail. Worm is in 
deep debt and needs Mike to help him 
accumulate a nice pile of cash to get out 
of it. So should Mike get back into gam
bling to help out his pal, or should he 
continue in his path towards legal suc
cess? Oh, the moral dilemma of it all.
Rounders proceeds from here exactly 
like you knew it would. Mike winds up 
spending more and more time playing 
poker and less and less time preparing to 
argue a case in law school moot court. His 
girlfriend cant take his slide downward 
and leaves him; he deals with his pain by
driving to Atlantic City to play some 
cards. Worm manages to offend someone 
else and rack up an even bigger debt, 
which Mike agrees to co-guarantee. 
Theres a big showdown at the end where 
everything rides on one game of poker.
Damon is a good actor, but hes not 
gritty enough to be believable as Mike. 
Hes not helped any by the script, which 
makes him intone such corny lines as: I 
knew all the reasons I shouldnt be here. 
But sometimes reasons dont matter. 
Forget about the card games  for 
Damon and the rest of the cast, keeping 
a poker face during the dialogue is ac
complishment enough.
Yet I didnt have a bad time watching 
Rounders. Director John Dahl does do a 
good job evoking the seediness and men
ace of the poker underworld. His gam
bling characters have names like Joey 
Knish and Amarillo Slim and spew poker 
slang so quickly that it must be authen
tic. His shots ofthe locales ofpoker games 
convey so much atmosphere you can smell 
the fear. And he puts you right in the 
games, making you feel the immediacy.
Despite the dialogue, the movies cast 
is universally strong. Especially good 
are Norton, whose false bravado as Worm 
is almost touching, and John Malkovich, 
who plays a poker kingpin with ties to 
the Russian mob and a taste for Oreo 
cookies. Watching Malkovich unscrew
ing an Oreo, and eating it bit by agoniz
ing bit while Damon nervously waits for 
him to reveal his cards, is nearly worth 
the price of admission. The movie moves 
along quickly and holds your attention. 
Watching all the clichs run by was fun.
Yes, I know all the reasons I shouldnt 
have liked this movie. But sometimes 
reasons just dont matter.
Scholar speaks on new artform
By SUSAN MURRAY
Tartan Staffwriter
These days it seems as if noth
ing is truly cutting-edge unless 
it has the term interactive at
tached to it. As if constructing a 
compelling and exciting work of 
literature, drama, music, or 
sculpture werent hard enough, 
it seems that to really catch an 
audiences attention it must be 
interactive as well.
Amidst all the confusion, Janet 
Murray, an MIT literature pro
fessor, released; Hamlet on the 
Holodeck. The book makes light 
of the challenges that will face 
creators of interactive environ
ments in years to come and is 
one Lof the first publications to 
address the problems raised by 
interactive technologys increas
ing influence on the arts. Murray 
maintains that behind all of the 
hype there is an emerging and 
revolutionary new means of ar
tistic expression. She will speak 
on campus next week about this 
new field and the accompanying 
dilemmas interactive technolo
gies face as an artform.
Murray serves as director of 
the Laboratory for Advanced 
Technology in the Humanities 
at MIT, and is one leader in this 
emerging field of research. Her 
talk, which will take place on 
September 23 as part of the 
Presidents Lecture Series, will 
focus on her recent publication. 
Murray wrote the book as a kind 
of manifesto to encourage devel
opment in the field. She even 
has a definition of the term in
teractive. She said that to be 
interactive, it must be partici
patory, governed by certain 
rules, and it must give the par
ticipants the pleasure of con
trolling their own experiences.
When asked for an example of 
a truly interactive technology, 
Murray mentioned Petz, which 
are virtual dogs which live and 
roam across your computer desk
top, beg to be played with, sulk, 
howl, growl, and scratch, very 
much like real dogs. The Petz 
grow over a period of weeks, 
they can be taught tricks, or 
trained to stay off your term
paper while youre typing. Murray 
explained that because the dogs 
change over the course of their 
relationship with the user, a kind 
of primitive narrative is formed. 
The relationship has narrative 
elements, as in a beginning, 
middle, and end. The dog starts 
as a puppy, grows, and ceases to 
exist when the user becomes dis
interested and decides to create a 
new pet. Evolving agents, like 
the dogs, play a large role in more 
complex narratives. They hold the 
users attention as they help to 
shape a larger 
narrative.
This narrative 
is at the base of 
almost all of 
Murrays re
search. In her 
book she discusses 
relationships and 
dichotomy be
tween two ideas: a 
modern one, the 
holodeck from the 
television show 
Star Trek, a space 
in which anything 
is possible, and a 
classical one, 
Shakespeares 
drama Hamlet.
She considers the 
idea of what would 
happen if a per
son played the character of Ham
let through the holodeck.
Whether or not it is possible for 
narrative art to exist in an inter
active environment is a hot topic 
of debate. Some of Murrays crit
ics feel that interactive technolo
gies will never grow beyond the 
industry of video games. How, 
they ask, can an artist shape a 
story in an environment that is 
variable? They insist that a user 
will never make the choices that 
take traditional audiences to truly 
dramatic moments which make 
narrative so compelling. A com
mon point made on some of the 
more noisy Internet bulletin 
boards is Would a user playing 
Oedipus ever gouge his eyes out?
Murray does not feel that this 
technology will eclipse existing 
artistic media. She thinks that 
people will still go to the theater,
read, and watch movies and tele
vision. Interactive technologies 
will simply be another way to ex
perience stories. She also insists 
that the work will not stop at 
gaming. It means we have a new 
power, a new set of shapes to rep
resent human experience, she 
said.
Interactive technologies such 
as branching fiction (ChooseYour-Own-Adventure novels), 
virtual reality simulations, and 
even Sony PlayStation video 
games represent a new form of

artist expression, one that re
quires more of the artist than 
ever before. Not only must the 
artist anticipate the reaction of 
his or her audience, to a single 
line of experience but he must 
also anticipate what choices the 
user may wish to make and cre
ate a set of branches. Each 
branch, ideally, is as rich as a 
traditional story line. Murray 
understands the challenges in
volved in the creation of interac
tive worlds; still, she feels that 
digital mediums have the poten
tial to be harbors of true artistic 
inventiveness. I think its pos

WRCT launches fall season
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Contributing Editor
Go ahead. Flip your tuner to
88.3 FM.
If youve been at CMU for any 
amount of time and have man
aged to pull yourself away from 
your computer every once in a 
while, youll know not to expect 
the latest Spice Girls song or 
Puff Daddy tune from Carnegie 
Mellons free-form radio station, 
WRCT.
We have some DJs who wont 
even play a CD if it has a barcode 
on it, theyre that opposed to 
commercial radio, said Reed 
Taylor, WRCT general manager 
and electrical and computer en
gineering masters student. 
When people think of WRCT as 
being restricted in its musical 
choices, its because its non-traditional. Were not like the com
mercial radio stations. But were 
that way by definition. Its our 
mission to not be like them. Sup
pose somebody did come in and 
wanted to play a very straight
forward classic rock show. 
Theres no way that person could 
do it as well as a commercial 
rock station could, because the 
classic rock station is being paid 
money to do that.
As it begins the fall season, the 
station plans to continue with 
much of the programming that 
has been successful in the past.
Were going to try to get bands 
in the studio and do live record
ings, said Patrick Randerson, 
senior physics major and WRCT 
music director. In the past, 
weve done a lot of smaller local 
bands, but this year were also 
going to try to get the bands 
that AB brings in.
Cliff Chien, sophomore indus
trial management major and 
member of the WRCT music 
staff, is looking to have the sta
tion sponsor Ensign, a punk/ 
hardcore band this semester. I 
was trying to get more hardcore 
and punk acts to play at CMU, 
he said. But at WRCT, we try to 
get acts suitable for CMU, and 
Ensign probably appeals to about 
5 percent of the population.
While the falls program sched

In the UCs basement, DJs plan set lists from over 90,000 volumes.
ule hasnt been finalized yet, 
Randerson said that he is notic
ing a trend among DJs to play 
classic swing and blues music.
The only control over program
ming we really have is that the 
music staff decides what goes into 
rotation, said Randerson. When 
the station gets new albums, the 
music staff reviews and sorts the 
albums and puts them into the 
playbin, or bin as it is commonly 
known. Each DJ is required to 
play three bin cuts each hour.
A current trend in DJs pro
grams is towards swing, said 
Randerson. Swing has been so 
popular recently that were sort of 
seeing a backlash  some of the 
DJs basicaly said, Ill show you 
what swing is like, and theyre 
going to go back and play older 
music.... Overall, were seeing a 
rounder, fuller jazz program  
bebop is making a comeback.
New DJs each year also add up 
to changes in WRCT programming, 
as DJs pick and choose tunes to air.
Musical tastes are getting 
more diverse, said Paul Jacobs, 
junior industrial management 
major and WRCT training direc
tor. We usually have about 60 
who become DJs at the end of the 
year, so its going really well.
Taylor said that this year, due 
to the influx of new staff mem
bers, it looks like WRCT member
ship will reach 200 students. Be
cause of the increased number of 
DJs that the station will have by
mid-November, Taylor said that 
the station will likely be broad
casting a full 24 hours per day.
By virtue of having so many 
people, we can be a little more 
selective in whos on the air, said 
Taylor. If someone is consistently 
making mistakes or being irre
sponsible, we now have replace
ments. If someones showing that 
they dont have a lot of respect for 
the show they have, I can count off 
five people who have shows from 4
- 6 am who are dying for that 12 -
2 pm slot. Its not so much that 
were kicking people out as that 
they know that we can.
But this knowledge hasnt dis
couraged the current trainees. 
What got me interested in WRCT 
was my experience in listening to 
the radio station for the past year 
or so, said Lee Horen, sopho
more business administration 
major and WRCT trainee. I 
mostly listen to hip-hop music  
independent hip-hop, breakbeats, 
and whatnot. Horen hopes to 
eventually DJ a hip-hop show.
Taylor admits that the station 
sometimes receives comments 
from listeners who complain 
about the music, but says that 
the stations free-format makes 
it largely immune to complaints 
about the musical style.
If you turn WRCT on and say 
Ugh, I hate this, that means 
dont turn us on then, said Tay
lor. It doesnt mean dont ever 
turn it on.

Burnt By the Sun
I know, I know. We all hate subtitles. Theres just 
something about reading in the movies that makes 
us feel dirty all over. But, Id like to convince you to 
get over that literary hump and go see this movie. 
Nikita Mikhalkov directed, wrote, and starred as 
Colonel Serguei Kotovin this 1995 Oscar winner for 
best foreign film about life during Stalins regime. 
Basically, Serguei thinks that just because he was 
this big Bolshevik war hero he can take his much 
younger wife Maroussia and precocious six year-old 
daughter Nadiaand retire quietly in the idyllic 
Russian countryside. Everything is going just fine 
for awhile, but then Dmitri shows up. Who is Dmitri, 
you ask? Well, hes Maroussias former lover who 
ran off years earlier. And I dont have to tell you that 
when your much younger wifes ex-lover shows up, 
no matter how cute your daughter is, everything 
pretty much goes to crap. Then its only a matter of 
time before.... Wait, I should probably stop. Youll 
be doing enough reading during the movie.

The Last Days of Disco
Whit Stillman wrote and directed (but didnt star 
in, the slacker!) this film which takes a nostalgic 
look back to New York in the early 80s. The movie 
focuses on Alice and her roommate, Charlotte, as 
they graduate college, get jobs, and jump right into

_scene. Its there that they meet the floor manager 
who wards off unattractive girls by telling them hes

Do you ever get the feeling that some movies are 
made just so that the titles can later be used for 
porno films? At first I thought it was just me, but 
after Blown Away and now this, Im beginning to 
think theres something to it. At least its the 
deeper, so to speak, of this summers asteroid

Affleck, its got to be. It stars Mrs. David Duchovny

I dare anyone to dislike the star of this movie. Hes 
starred in 66 movies, hes a master comedian, he 
does his own stunts, and he only speaks a smatter

indicates, hes drunk! While this movie has sub
titles as well, I can save you some valuable reading 
time by telling you that dialogue is not the reason to 
see this film. Instead concentrate on the magnifi
cence of a youthful Jackie Chan in his element and 
drunkenly kicking ass.

Back in 1987, a band called 
White Zombie appeared with 
Psycho-head Blowout. The highpitched vocalist of the noisy band, 
Rob Straker, would later change 
his name to Rob Zombie and shift 
the bands emphasis to heavy 
metal. Over 10 years later, he 
strikes out on his own with 
Hellbilly Deluxe, a crunching 13- 
track assault of guttural vocals 
and saw-toothed guitars.

strange world.
Dragula, the first single,

Hole
Celebrity Skin  DGC
Looking through various en
tertainment magazines this 
week, it seems that it will be 
difficult to find one not featuring 
a review of Holes third full-length 
album, Celebrity Skin. Even more 
challenging will be finding a re
view that doesnt compare the 
disc to 1994s landmark Live 
Through This, and that doesnt 
provide a full biography of 
Courtney Love and try to explain 
where she fits in todays pop cul
ture. After hearing the new disc 
though, it should be equally hard 
for critics to avoid discussing the 
album  a rich, impressive work 
that again proves that Loves tal
ents are more than deserving of 
her fame.
The music itself has under
gone something of a revision fit
ting of the bands place in the 
music world today. Gone are the 
underproduction, edginess, and 
grungy vocals that made Live 
Through This such a master
piece. Remaining, however, is 
the innovation and thoughtful
ness that marked their best pre
vious work. The first single, Ce
lebrity Skin, shifts between 
metal riffs and pop melodies, as 
does the abuse-themed Hit So 
Hard. Both tracks display the 
power and dynamics that have
made the band popular.
It could be argued that the in
fluence of Smashing Pumpkins 
singer Billie Corgan toned down 
Holes sound, much as Corgan 
did on the Pumpkins Adore. But 
here the change seems like more 
of an adjustment rather than an 
overhaul. The five songs with the 
Corgan imprint on them are all 
strong  in a sense trading Holes 
raggedness for a fuller, more ac
cessible sound.
Despite all the talk of Hole 
perhaps losing some intensity on 
Celebrity Skin, the albums true 
highlights arrive during the most 
provocative and haunting tracks. 
Northern Star, an account of 
fear and loss, creates a cold, deso
late atmosphere by deploying 
strings and acoustic guitars as 
well as Loves only real howling 
on the entire disc. Maybe even 
more interesting is the brisk, 
heavy Playing Your Song, which 
balances an attention-grabbing 
Indian-influenced riff with Loves 
most explicit Cobain references, 
resulting in the albums most com
pelling listen.
Celebrity Skin probably wasnt 
the album most listeners were 
counting on from Hole. Certainly
no one expected them to try anijl 
recapture their formula from th^ 
grunge era, which they thankjfully didnt. Some may have ex
pected a lamentation, or even  
reinvention of the bands souncj. 
Instead, Hole has made a dis 
that is neither an attempt t() 
revitalize alternative rock no): 
just a 40 minute response to th 
media. Love and her bandmatefe 
have simply made a remarkablte 
album that addresses what thfe 
band feels necessary and other
wise focuses on tight, clear 
songwriting. At this stage in her 
career, an album this strong is 
Loves best bet to keep her bad 
girl image and, in todays 
jumbled poplandscape, stil'l 
matter. - ANDY FRANCIS !

Last Days of Dude
Long ago, being a dude meant that you were something special  
that people respected you. The requirements were easy enough. A per
son was either a dandy man, extremely fastidious in dress and manner, 
or he was a city dweller too unfamiliar with life on the range to be a 
dude. Eventually, surfers popularized the word dude in their 
own way along with many other phrases like cowabunga, boda
cious, and radical, man and the world was never the same 
again. Soon enough, though, the word became popular among 
normal everyday folk, and usage of the word increased expo
nentially. In addition to just calling somebody else dude, there 
are now specialized versions of the word like Doctor Dork or 
dorky dork. People have even gone as far as creating new 
spellings of the word like doode or dewd just to differ between 
different people. Nevertheless, being called a dude just 
doesn't mean as much as it used to.
