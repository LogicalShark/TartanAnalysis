Business and Planning, spoke 
next, emphasizing the need for 
input from the community. The 
master plan will serve as a 
roadmap to the future, he said.
Following Bolton, Paul

CMU seeks increased diversity
By SARASTELLE
Tartan Staffwriter
Through efforts such as 
new recruitment strategies 
formed by the Office of 
Admissions and the intro
duction of the Diversity
Advisory Council by
President Cohon, Carnegie 
Mellon is determined to 
increase the African 
American, Latino and
Hispanic, and Native
American populations on 
campus.
Increasing diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon was one of 
the top four priorities in the 
strategic plan formed in 
May 1998. This plan result
ed in the formation of a 
task force on diversity. This 
13-member committee pro
duced a 17-page report 
making such recommenda
tions as working to extend 
research opportunities to 
minority undergraduates,
developing more mentoring 
programs, and creating a 
University Diversity 
Resource Guide to help 
recruit minority faculty and 
staff. They also recom
mended that President 
Cohon appoint an advisory 
board, of which he will be 
the head,. thus resulting in 
the formation of the 
Diversity Advisory Board.
In a recent Statement on 
Diversity, Cohon said, I 
take on this role with 
enthusiasm, for I attach 
great importance to our 
being a truly inclusive orga
nization in which all of us 
can realize our full poten
tial. ... Excellence is not lim
ited to a single race, gender, 
ethnic group, religion, or 
sexual orientation. There 
are large and increasing 
numbers of qualified candi
dates in each of these 
groups, whose admission as

students with a 1200 SAT 
score or higher, but this 
population is small in
The board will consist of 
around 20 administrators, 
faculty members, staff, stu
dents, alumni, trustees, 
and other outside represen
tatives. According to Cohon, 
the group plans on having 
its first meeting before 
Thanksgiving break. The 
boards main goals will be 
to act as an advisory body 
to the University in identi
fying new activities that 
will increase diversity and 
also to evaluate previous 
efforts, to increase aware
ness of the issue, and to 
monitor the progress made.
Michael Steidel, director 
of Admissions, stated that 
the Office of Admissions 
has worked to develop an 
Ethnic Minority
Recruitment Strategy that 
was initiated in May 1999. 
Carnegie Mellon is actively 
looking to admit minority
number and in extremely 
high demand among CMU 
and competitors such 
as MIT, Johns Hopkins 
University, and the 
University of Pennsylvania.
According to Steidel, over 
the past five years, the 
number of minority stu
dents, including African 
Americans, Latinos, and 
Hispanics, enrolling at 
Carnegie Mellon seems to 
have plateaued. There was 
a moderate increase in 
applicants between 1995 
and 1998, when the 
University briefly awarded 
race-based, full-tuition 
scholarships, but even with 
these incentives the num
ber of students who went on 
to enroll has been fairly 
steady. Part of the problem, 
said Steidel, is that most of

Textbook site gets sued by Duke
DURHAM, N.C. (U-WIRE)/2Vie 
Chronicle (Duke U.)  The National 
Association of College Stores alleges 
that Varsitybooks.com has been mis
leading students about potential 
online savings.
In the midst of its initial public 
stock offering, the nations first online 
textbook retailer is now fighting to 
make sure its stock does not flatline 
when it hits the market.
In a suit filed at 10 am Monday 
by the National Association of 
College Stores, Inc. (NACS), 
Varsitybooks.com has been accused 
of making false and misleading 
advertising claims about its 
discounts and on-campus stores 
pricing schemes.
NACS, an organization of 3,000 col
lege bookstores, including Duke 
University Stores and The Book
Exchange in Durham, NC, is seeking 
an injunction against the site for its 
insistence that it offers texts at 40 
percent below the suggested price. 
NACS officials say this price stan
dard does not exist in the college text
book market and that the web sites 
prices only rarely beat on-campus 
stores by 40 percent.

Carnegie Mellons Administrative

(ACIS) has declared the University 
Y2K compliant.
CMU systems have been repaired. 
We can feel confident, and computers 
will continue to operate, said Len 
Brush, assistant vice president of ACIS.
Brush said that the staff has checked 
every corner of the University making 
sure that all is well. We looked at 
every piece of equipment including
fire alarms and security systems, 
he said.
Until now, many computer programs 
have used two digits to represent years, 
instead of four, to conserve storage space 
and increase processing speed. However, 
in the year 2000, the last two digits 00 
may be read as 00 in 1900 as opposed 
to 2000. This can cause serious damage 
to society as well as to the community of 
our campus. To fix this problem, a tech

Terrorist attack wounds 
many, threatens peace
NETANYA, Israel (AP)  On the eve 
of final status talks with the 
Palestinians, police on Sunday blamed 
an explosion in the busy coastal town of 
Netanya on Islamic militants opposed to 
the process.
Three pipe bombs injured 33 Israelis 
and raised questions about whether 
Palestinians are able to meet the major 
Israeli expectation of peace and an end 
to terror.
There were no fatalities. Two of the 
victims suffered moderate injuries and 
the rest were slightly injured, said 
Danny Hadad, deputy police commander 
of Netanya and the surrounding area. 
Ambulances took 21 victims to hospitals, 
while others arrived on foot or by car.
A fourth pipe bomb failed to explode. It 
was taken to the beach by the police 
bomb squad and detonated safely.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the 
government will not capitulate to terror
ism. There are elements who will try to 
torpedo the peace process, he told 
reporters. They will not succeed. The 
government and the security services 
will smash the terrorism.
The pipe bombs, placed close together, 
exploded outside a large bank in a busy 
shopping area. The twisted remains of a 
bicycle and a garbage can blown open by 
the bomb lay on a charred sidewalk at 
an intersection.
At a street corner near the site, about 
30 residents of Netanya gathered and 
shouted Death to Arabs and Barak 
Go Home.
Israeli and Palestinian representa
tives are scheduled to meet Monday in 
the West Bank town of Ramallah to 
begin negotiations on a permanent 
peace agreement.
Last week, Israel, the Palestinians, 
and the United States launched socalled final status peace talks, which 
address permanent borders of the 
Palestinian entity, the future of 
Jewish settlements in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip and conflicting claims
on Jerusalem and division of 
water resources.
Militant Islamic groups are opposed to 
the peace talks and have sworn to sabo
tage them.
The explosions come the day after 
the militant Islamic Hamas movement 
faxed a leaflet to an international news 
agency threatening attacks against 
Israeli citizens.
Hamas said Israel would be to blame 
for the attacks because it had ignored a 
cease-fire offer from the group that 
would involve the evacuation of settlers 
from disputed lands.
We will not hesitate to announce that 
the next weeks and months will witness 
an escalation in the size and nature of 
our armed attacks, said the leaflet, 
signed by the groups military wing.
Still, no group claimed responsibility. 
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader 
of Hamas, said he could not yet 
say whether his group was involved 
in the explosion, stressing that he 
did not directly oversee Hamas mili
tary wing.
Netanya is known as a hub of orga
nized crime in the country, and pipe 
bombs have been used in the past to set
tle scores.
It has also been the site of terrorist 
attacks, most recently in July, when a 
pipe bomb caused no injuries and 
little damage.
The Palestinian Authority condemned ' 
the attack in an official communique, 
suggesting that Iranian-based groups 
may have been responsible.
This attack is aimed at sabotaging the 
peace process, especially now that we 
are close to beginning final status talks, 
the statement said.
The Palestinian security chief in the 
West Bank, Jibril Rajoub, said his 
staff was working hard to prevent 
such attacks.
The Palestinian authority is doing 
more than 100 percent to make sure 
such acts do not happen, he said.
Gates reacts to Church falls on 
trial resolution parishioners
WASHINGTON (AP)  Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates said in a letter 
published Sunday that the software 
maker is committed to a fair and 
responsible resolution of its 
antitrust trial.
Meanwhile, the Justice 
Departments top antitrust enforcer 
said that the government is looking 
at a full range of remedies to find 
the appropriate punishment, follow
ing a judges ruling that Microsoft is 
a monopoly.
Still, Assistant Attorney General 
Joel Klein also said that obviously 
settlement is always an option. He 
refused to discuss specifics.
We would need a settlement that 
deals with the very findings that the 
court made in this case, a settle
ment that produces consumer 
choice, innovation, and competition 
in the market, Klein said.
Gates, in a full-page advertise
ment published in The Washington 
Post and addressed to the companys 
customers, partners, and sharehold
ers, commented on Fridays ruling 
by U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson.
Jackson found that Microsoft used 
its overwhelming dominance of 
the computer software market
place. The judge did not identify 
which U.S. antitrust laws Micro
soft might have violated or 
suggest how the company should 
be punished.
A separate punishment hearing 
would be held next year, if necessary 
after Jackson issues his 
final ruling.
Microsoft is committed to resolv
ing this matter in a fair and respon
sible manner, Gates wrote, while 
ensuring that the fundamental prin
ciples of consumer benefit and inno
vation are protected.
The letter was similar to Gates 
statement he issued Friday after 
Jacksons decision was released. The 
letter was sent Friday, according to 
the companys Web site.
ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. 
(AP)  The concrete roof of a cov
ered walkway collapsed Sunday as 
churchgoers socialized between ser
vices, injuring 17 people.
Dozens of people on and near the 
walkway had been sharing dough
nuts and coffee at St. Mary 
Magdalene Catholic Church when 
the structure came down, wit
nesses said.
I heard the crash, looked out the 
window, saw everybody running, 
but I didnt know what it was all 
about, said Sister Rita Galligan, 
who heard the collapse from her 
home at the convent next door. 
When I went over there, they were 
just lying on the ground with people 
all around them.
Of the 17 people taken to hospi
tals, the most seriously injured suf
fered from a hip fracture and a 
spinal injury. None of the injuries 
was considered life-threatening, 
authorities said.Students decry 
lack of alcohol
BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP)  About 
150 Lehigh University students 
protested the schools program to 
curb binge drinking, saying the pol
icy hurts campus spirit and has 
prompted some students to 
abuse drugs.
The half-hour protest Saturday 
ended with students signing a 
petition that demanded changes 
in Project IMPACT, which 
stands for Involving Multiple 
Partners in Achieving a Cul
tural Transformation.
This is killing our school, 19- 
year-old junior Walker Conolly said. 
We must come together and fight 
this. If everyone on the Hill signs 
this petition, they have to listen.
The rally started as a disorga
nized congregation of students 
milling around the lawn, a few
wearing shirts that said, I do drugs 
at Lehigh cause I cant drink.
John Smeaton, vice provost of stri
dent affairs, said he would be wilt
ing to consider changing Project 
IMPACT, but that Lehigh remain s 
committed to curbing binge drink
ing. If someone has a better idea 
that we havent thought of, well lis
ten, he said.
University officials say Project 
IMPACTS intent is not to ban drink
ing, but to promote responsible 
drinking as well as alternatives for 
students who prefer not to drink.
The new restrictions regulate the 
amount of alcohol at campus parties 
and require two university staff 
members to monitor the parties. 
The university also provides money 
so fraternities can hold nonalcoho
lic parties.
Smoking rate 
stays constant
ATLANTA, (AP)  While smoking 
has declined among most adults in 
the 1990s, an increasing number of 
18-to-24 year olds are picking up the 
habit, the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reported 
Thursday.
As a result, smoking among 
adults has held steady overall at 
about 25 percent throughout the 
1990s, leveling off after a quarter 
century of reductions.
About 48 million adults smoked 
cigarettes in 1997, according to >a 
CDC survey that year of more 
than 3/5,000 people nationwide. 
The rate was the same  24.7 per
cent  in 1995. It was 25.5 percent 
in 1990.
Among most adult' age groups, 
smoking rates actually declined 
from 1990 to 1997, but the percent
age of smokers ages 18 to 24 
increased during that period, from 
24.5 percent to 28.7 percent.
Anti-smoking advocates said the 
.popularity of cigarettes among 
young adults is troubling, but it is 
also the group where further reduc
tions are most likely to occur.
Pope states all people should have freedom of religion
NEW DELHI, India (AP)  
With his minority church under 
fire by some Hindus for its mis
sionary work, Pope John Paul II 
said Sunday that freedom to 
practice or change ones religion 
must be considered a basic 
human right.
Frail and moving slowly in the 
heat, the pope celebrated his 
only Mass in India on the same 
day as Diwali, a major Hindu 
holiday that is marked by lights 
and firecrackers. He then 
attended a meeting with repre
sentatives of other religions, 
describing it as a further sign 
that Roman Catholics seek dia
logue with other faiths.
No state, no group has the 
right to control either directly or 
indirectly a persons religious 
convictions ... or the respectful
appeal of a particular religion to 
peoples free conscience, John 
Paul told them.
The pope rested his head in 
his hands through most of the 
90-minute interfaith meeting, 
as the religious leaders uttered 
greetings in different lan
guages.
A Jain priest spoke with a 
mask over his mouth to avoid 
swallowing insects by accident, 
in keeping with the Jains belief 
against endangering animal 
life. A Parsi priest chanted a 
two-minute prayer for the popes 
health. The Sikh representative 
was a half-hour late because 
security men were wary of his 
four-foot silver sword, which 
he described as a symbol of 
my authority.
A bare-chested Hindu priest
sat next to the pope, clutching 
the popes hand in the air for 
photographers. But afterwards, 
the priest, Shankaracharya 
Madhavananda Saraswati, 
expressed reservations on the 
popes view of conversions, say
ing, Sometimes people change 
outside, but what is inside 
remains with the human 
being forever.
The visit was preceded by 
weeks of small but noisy 
protests from radical Hindus 
who accuse the church of illicit
ly inducing Hindus, mostly from 
poor and illiterate tribal areas, 
to convert to Christianity.
But the pope told people 
Sunday that he looks forward to 
a period of religious coexistence 
in Asia. Paying tribute to the 
ancient cultures of the region,
he spoke of my hope and dream 
that the next century will be a 
time for fruitful dialogue 
leading to a new relationship 
of understanding and solidar
ity and the tolerance of 
all religions.
The Mass was celebrated in a 
sports stadium in New Delhi. 
About 10 protesters in an open 
truck drove past the main gate 
of the stadium shouting slogans 
and waving a black flag, but 
they were ignored by people 
streaming into the field.
The stadium, which seats 
70,000, was only half full, 
reflecting the difficulty of 
obtaining passes which were 
issued only by church authori
ties. In an apparent security 
measure, each application had 
to be accompanied by a certifi
cate of good character from the 
persons parish.
The popes visit coincided with 
Diwali, the festival of lights, 
marking the victory of the god 
Rama over the demon king 
Ravana in Hindu mythology. It 
is a holiday when families unite 
and often celebrate with fire
works and special candles.
The Vatican announced that 
John Paul has contributed 
$300,000 for victims of the 
cyclone in eastern India  an 
unusually large gift from 
the Vatican.
The Mass came a day after the 
Pope issued a call to his bishops 
to spread Christianity through
out Asia, a continent where 
Roman Catholics are a 
tiny minority.
His encouragement of evange
lism angered militant Hin
dus who are campaigning 
against missionaries.
The pope came to India 
specifically to further the 
Christian idea of conversion. We 
will not allow this to happen, 
said Lokesh Pratap Singh, a 
spokesman for the World 
Hindu Council.
The 79-year-old pope 
appeared in good spirits, but he 
walked slowly, using a cane.
Bartholomew Abraham, a 40- 
year-old businessman, traveled 
to the Mass with other Catholics 
in southern India. In the 
current political climate, he 
said, some people view CatholicB 
as if they had hidden agendas.* 
There is no attempt to con
vert anybody, he said. We 
would like to share our faith.

50 YEARS AGO, November 8, 
1949  The Kiltie Band and 
Mens Glee Club recorded 
Carnegie Techs school songs. 
They were distributed by

money for the Kiltie Uniform 
band and the Glee Club 
Tbur fund.
The Carnegie Alma Mater, 
Dear Old Tech, The Skibo 
Song, and Fight For The Glory 
of Carnegie were recorded onto 
red Vinylite disks and contained 
in an album with pictures of the 
Kilties, tfye Glee Club, and

25 YEARS AGO, November 
12,1974  Carnegie Mellon went 
ahead with plans to connect the 
campus heating system to the
Bellefield Boiler plant, causing 
some buildings to go 24 hours 
without heat. Administrators met 
with 200 students who presented 
petitions with about 600 signa
tures of students who protested 
the conversion, saying it should 
be conducted over break, when 
there would be fewer students.
The shutdown affected build
ings south of Forbes Avenue, 
including all classroom buildings, 
all Hill dorms, Warner Hall, 
and Skibo.
10 YEARS AGO, November 
7, 1989  Junior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
Michael Golden died after 
crashing his car in Shady side. 
Golden was a member of Sigma 
Nu fraternity.
According to Pittsburgh Police,
Golden had been traveling the 
wrong way on Bouquet Street 
near Forbes Avenue at about 1 
am when he hit a car stopped in 
traffic. Golden proceeded to Fifth 
Avenue, and speeding eastbound, 
struck another car on Bellefield 
Street. When Golden turned 
sharply into a parking.lot near 
Shadyside Manor, his car skidded 
150 feet across the inbound lanes, 
flipped over the curb, and crashed 
through the hedges. The car land
ed upside down in the front yard 
of a private house. Golden died of 
multiple blunt-force trauma.
FIVE YEARS AGO,
November 14, 1994  In an 
effort to reverse the administra
tions decision to eliminate porno
graphic electronic bulletin boards 
from CMUs computer system,
students organized a rally 
against censorship at Warner 
Hall. Over 350 students, faculty, 
administrators, and staff attend
ed the 75-minute rally that fea
tured speakers from on and 
off campus.
ONE YEAR AGO, November 
9, 1998  The Fraternity Quad 
Planning Group, composed of 
representatives from the fraterni
ties and Housing Services, met to 
develop a plan to improve the liv

Diversity jump starts
a|#HLaU,t kF.O PnsR /
wishes to target are located in 
the South and are unlikely to 
relocate farther North.
Because of this realization, 
the Office of Admissions has 
declared what they call the 
Diversity Circle. This circle 
encompasses a smaller region, 
including Pittsburgh, New York 
City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, 
Washington, D.C., and 
Cleveland, on which 
Admissions plans to focus more 
closely. Instead of looking 
broadly at many areas, they 
are hoping that focusing their 
attention on a smaller area will 
bring more success. We are 
concentrating more in our 
area.... We decided that we 
want to win our region, said 
Steidel.
In order to achieve this suc
cess, Admissions is offering and 
attending numerous programs 
targeted towards recruiting 
minorities. Among these are 
high school visits, attendance 
at pre-college programs and 
college fairs, participation in 
outreach and community rela
tions, special publications and 
mailings, and Phone-a-thons. 
In the future, they are hoping 
to expand alumni and current 
student participation, increase 
the personalization of the 
recruitment process, and 
strengthen the national visibil
ity through web development 
targeted towards minority 
issues.
Besides efforts made to 
recruit minority students, 
there are also various pro
grams and events offered for 
current students in order to 
increase awareness and also 
offer support. The History 
Department has started an 
African-American History

Cohon believes that 
increased diversity will greatly 
improve the quality of Carnegie 
Mellon. Diverse perspectives 
and backgrounds breed the 
intellectual vitality essential 
for the health and progress of 
the university.... Certainly, our 
students will be better-educat
ed for having learned and lived 
in a multicultural community, 
he said.

During his talk, Gross showed 
slides of other campuses that 
his firm had worked on, such 
as the University of Virginia, 
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, and 
Emory University.
Gross said that the goal of this 
master plan is to integrate all 
areas of the campus. He also 
shared quotes from the strategic
plan and ideas that he thought 
exemplified the campus plan
ning process. The college needs 
to expand without losing its 
sense of community, he said.

those attending the meeting 
made their voices heard on sub
jects ranging from outdoor light

really impressed by the firm and 
the examples of what they had 
done, said Neil Lareau, a sopho

that one of his reasons for attend

wanted to see space on this cam

Mike Natale, a senior histo

meeting. Ive been at this 
school long enough to appreci

adding that fraternity housing 
was one of his main concerns: 
You want to make sure that 
some form of fraternity hous

as being the 1900s and numbers under 50 will be 
assumed to be in the 2000s.
Although the University is ready for the new 
millennium, ACIS is currently, working on a con
tingency plan to be carried out if computer 
glitches cause an emergency situation after 
December 31, 1999.
Although many of Carnegie Mellons systems 
have been made Y2K compliant by outside ven
dors, management is double-securing prepara
tions. We are preparing for the worst case. We 
are creating scenarios that possibly could hap
pen. What will we do? This is the contingency 
action plan, said Brush. This plan is designed to 
provide the best response to all life, safety, busi
ness, and operational continuity issues.
Power is one example. The Y2K project team 
has identified places on campus where, if power 
was lost, the University could continue regular 
routines on campus. CMU has invested in auxil
iary generators that turn on by a transfer switch 
that is triggered when power is lost. This is to 
provide electricity to vital systems at CMU such 
as computers and refrigeration for specimens 
used in research.
The contingency plan is a series of actions to 
be taken in response to any interruptions in 
service that are vital to the University com
munity. The complexity of each plan is based 
on the systems complexity, cost, and impor
tance to Carnegie Mellons society. The Y2K 
project team evaluated areas that needed to 
be Y2K-compliant and classified hundreds of 
systems according to their importance to the 
University. The most important of these are 
the life safety systems, including fire alarms 
and elevators. Others include lighting sys
tems, computers, telephones, and power sup
ply. The plan will also account for non-critical 
departmental control systems including cam
eras, refrigerators, kitchen equipment, and 
sprinkler systems.
All testing of machines, systems, and back-up 
plans should be completed by December 15.
Each department in the University is 
responsible for identifying liaisons and staff 
members to facilitate Y2K assurances. 
According to the Carnegie Mellon Contingency 
Action Plan, all non-essential consumption of 
electrical and other utility resources will cease 
over the holiday break. The project team will
suggest that any equipment powered by elec
tricity that is not vital be shut down to protect 
against damage and preserve resources that 
may be in demand for high-priority systems 
support. Those that need to be kept on will 
have auxiliary generators.
Although Carnegie Mellons telephone sys
tems are managed by Bell Atlantic, there are 
also two-way back-up communication systems 
provided in case the telephones go down. 
Steam generators will provide backup for cam
pus lighting.
In addition, the Y2K project team has identi
fied all the areas such as data that may need 
recovery action. The team is prepared to recover 
any lost materials and files.
CMU ACIS management has prepared a skele
ton crew that includes campus police, plumbers, 
electricians, and carpenters to be present on 
campus on New Years weekend for any emer
gencies. Management is asking that students 
and faculty not be on campus unless it is 
absolutely necessary. Those who will be on cam
pus over the break will be issued badges for per
missive identification. This is to identify those 
who are allowed to be on campus and it will 
make it easier for campus police to detect 
unwanted pranksters and vandals.
About 250-300 students, faculty and critical 
staff are expected to be on campus during 
December break. There will be extra security in 
needed areas such as the Hunt Library, GSIA, 
and Mellon Institute.
According to Brush, the cost of these prepara
tions does not seem to be a big factor. Many of 
the systems that need to be repaired for Y2K 
have been taken care of by vendors. The bill for 
preparing for the upcoming year is not in the 
millions but in the thousands.
Preparations for campus security for the 
millennium have also brought attention to 
repairing locks and keys in buildings through
out campus.
Brush said that the administration is not at 
all panicked and is very confident in its 
preparations for Y2K. Dan Kennedy, Associate 
Director of Enrollment Systems, also said 
that the student systems, such as student 
accounts, are in good order. We have had 
good contact with outside vendors, and most 
of our programs are run on a four-digit 
date program.

claims about a suggested price, said Cynthia 
DAngelo, senior associate executive director of 
NACS. There are very few textbooks that offer a 
suggested price. They advertise a discount of 40 
percent, yet thats not the industry standard.
Jim Wilkerson, director of Duke University 
Stores, declined to comment on the case because 
he had not yet read the lawsuit. He said he uses 
some suggested prices to set the Universitys in
store prices, adding that he relies on other meth
ods when book distributors do not suggest a fee.
Varsitybooks.com officials declined to respond 
specifically to the charges, in part because they 
involve litigation and also because of the compa
nys pending IPO of up to $75 million worth of 
shares. The Washington, D.C.-based company 
announced the forthcoming move a few weeks 
ago. The lawsuit NACS filed against 
Varsitybooks.com is completely without merit. I 
think that will be borne out as we proceed, said 
Jon Kaplan, vice president for communication 
and strategic planning for Varsitybooks.com. But 
Varsity has tried to bring choice and competition 
to the college textbook marketplace and its unfor
tunate that NACS would proceed in this manner 
against us.
College textbooks are a $5 billion per year indus
try. Although Varsitybooks.com claims less than 
one percent of this figure  $5.1 million in rev
enues through the first 8 months of 1999  NACS 
officials are concerned about the leading online 
businesss practices in the burgeoning market.
Crime and Incident Report
Its not like were complaining about online 
bookselling. If anything, were looking into it, 
DAngelo said. Its not that were against compe
tition, we just want there to be a level playing' 
field. Businesses shouldnt try to dupe and take 
advantage of the college student.
Wilkerson said Duke Stores has not suffered! 
as online book sales have grown, and, like| 
other traditional bookstores, may soon offei] 
online sales. So far, our revenues are up com-; 
pared to last year, Wilkerson said. However, 
online bookselling is a new trend of doing busi
ness that I think all booksellers are going to 
have to venture into to remain competitive in 
price and services.
In the suit, NACS claims that 
Varsitybooks.corns supposedly drastic discounts 
easily trick college students, who often experience 
sticker shock at the high prices of textbooks at! 
on-campus bookstores. DAngelo explained that} 
students often think their college bookstores are! 
taking advantage of them and become particular-; 
ly receptive to discount offers.
Varsitybooks.com has already toned down some 
of its 40 percent-off discount claims but is gearing 
up for a David vs. Goliath battle against NACSj 
Kaplan said. Varsitybooks.com is going to focus 
on what is most important, which is continuing to 
work hard to provide college students with choice 
and discussion in the textbook marketplace, he 
said. Were keeping our eyes on the ball, and not 
focusing on this matter, but on the real purpose of 
serving students.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University8 November 1999
Parking, dorms top 
master plan issues
Last week, the Master Plan Com
mittee held an open discussion with 
the campus community about the 
architectural direction in which 
Carnegie Mellon should move over 
the next couple of decades. For the 
next year the committee will be 
collecting suggestions from the 
campus community. In drafting the 
new plan, the committee should 
keep in mind the importance of 
addressing two serious issues  
parking and residential space.
There is a seemingly endless 
shortage of parking on campus. 
While the need to expand and up
date facilities on campus is clear, 
doing so at the expense of parking 
would only exacerbate an already 
frustrating problem that too many 
members of the University have to 
deal with on a day-to-day basis. 
The architecture firm Ayers/Sainty 
Gross presented parking solutions 
implemented at other campuses, 
including garages and under
ground facilities, and CMU should 
consider adopting these solutions 
to its own needs.
Another place where space is 
short is in the residence halls. Ev
ery year, a number of first-year 
students are forced to five in offcampus apartmentsand a hand
ful are temporarily placed in hotels 
 due to the shortage of available 
housing on campus. Livingon cam
pus during the first year of college 
facilitates familiarizing oneself 
with the community, as well as 
becoming involved. Additionally, 
the space between Dormer Hall and 
Margaret Morrison should remain 
open, as it is one of the few remain
ing open spaces left on campus. It
should be possible to meet the need 
for new dorms along Morewood or 
in the Roselawn area.
The importance of green space 
and landscaping, particularly at a 
small urban campus like CMUs, 
must also be considered. Recent 
construction has added new facili
ties that are of great value to the 
University, but they have also had 
an impact on greenery. The Cut 
would be an ideal place to add 
trees, benches, tables, and maybe 
even a fountain.
In addition to adding new facili
ties to the University, the Master 
Planning Committee should tar
get certain areas for much-needed 
renovation. Skibo Gym stands 
apart from the rest of campus, and 
any improvements that could inte
grate it better would be valuable. 
Margaret Morrison Plaza used to 
be a student area, but a portion of 
it is now office space. The offices 
should be moved, and the area 
should once again serve students. 
The old Student Center is an eye
sore. More efficient use of the space 
that it sits on would improve cam
pus. Finally, the Fraternity Quad
rangle stands in a state of disre
pair, its houses having outlived 
their intended use. The University 
should work with the fraternities 
to rebuild these houses to improve 
the quality of life on the Quad.
This list is not meant to be ex
haustive, but it is a place to start. 
The rest of the campus should con
tact the committee with their own 
suggestions, as the Master Plan 
Committee has demonstrated wel
come openness in soliciting input 
for the plan.
Vandalism damages 
campus community
Last week, Mayur, the South 
Asian student organization, 
painted the Fence in order to pub
licize their event, A Passage 
Through India. Sometime on 
Wednesday night, their work was 
vandalized with profanity and 
scribbling. Whoever is responsible, 
be it members of the CMU commu
nity or someone in the Pittsburgh 
community, should take notice that 
these occurrences of vandalism 
cheapen the tradition of the Fence 
and show a lack of respect for all 
those who work and study at Car
negie Mellon. Defacing the work of 
others and our communal property 
should not be taken lightly.
In the case of Mayur, their at
tempt to publicize an event open to 
the entire campus community was 
painted over with phrases such as 
Fuck the fence, and This fence is 
gay, as well as what might have 
been the initials and names of those 
responsible. According to CMU 
Police, the profanity was covered 
over by Physical Plant staff mem
bers after being brought to their 
attentionbyDeanMichaelMurphy. 
This crime is insulting to Mayur. 
Many students work hard to publi
cize events by using the Fence, 
doing so while following the tradi
tional rules of respect and coopera
tion. They should not have to be 
subject to such inconsiderate acts.
Other recent incidents of vandal
ism include an object thrown 
through a second-floor window in
Margaret Morrison last week, and 
the spray painting of a University 
Center sign on Forbes Avenue sev
eral weeks ago. And just last night, 
an unidentified party attempted to 
steal a statue from CFA, breaking 
itin the process. Incidents like these 
are difficult and expensive to clean 
up, meaning more money spent on 
clean up that could be spent on 
improvingthe campus, ratherthan 
rectifying destruction. Theseoccurrences demonstrate a disappoint
ing lack of maturity.
Campus Police recognizes that 
these events are generally isolated. 
Violators are difficult to catch since 
there are rarely eyewitnesses. Of
ten, graffiti is not reported unless it 
is offensive. The haphazard nature 
of these crimes places the burden of 
responsibility on those with oppor
tunity to respect the others work 
and leave property untouched.
A step in the right direction re
cently came from Student Senate. 
Last semester, Senate worked with 
the administration on revising 
University policy on vandalism to 
clarify its intent and hold campus 
community members accountable.
The administration should send 
a message that violators will not be 
tolerated. Campus Police has al
ready made it known that those 
who vandalize on this campus will 
be subject to city arrest. The entire 
campus community should send a 
message of respect by sympathiz
ing, rather than participating.

Letters to the Editor
Students must 
not abuse Fence
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Permit me to add a 
few observations to 
your welcome editorial 
about the recent mo
nopolization of the 
Fence [Fence painters must respect 
CMU tradition, Nov. 1]. Although I do 
not favor the faculty or administration 
intervening in matters of student cul
ture, like many others, I have been irked 
by the current situation.
This past summer, I spoke with Dean 
Michael Murphy about my concern that 
Fence painters were killing the adjacent 
(and now apparently dead) tree. While I 
had the Deans ear, I mentioned that 
guarding the Fence seemed to be get
ting out of hand. The same organiza
tions, I claimed, were monopolizing the 
venue for weeks or months at a time, and 
were erecting shanties that are not only 
eyesores but also accident and fire 
hazards. The dwellings are poorly con
structed, and electric appliances from 
TVs and stereos to microwaves and 
toaster ovens are powered by a drop 
cord that snakes through the rain and 
mud from an outlet at the base of the 
campus clock. I remarked that one tele
phone call to the Pittsburgh fire mar
shal would undoubtedly bring an end to 
these structures.
However, Dean Murphy was skeptical 
of my claim that the Fence is routinely 
held for long periods by the same organi
zations, and so I agreed to keep track of 
the use of the Fence during the fall term. 
The following is a list of organizations 
that have guarded the Fence, the mes
sages they have painted on it, and the 
approximate dates of their occupations.
The dates are approximate because I 
was not always on campus on the precise 
day when the Fence changed hands.
 August 6th: Delta Tau Delta took 
the Fence, and held it for a full month, 
until September 7th; their large shanty 
contained three couches, a television, 
and other appliances. Their first mes
sage was Delta Tau Delta: Because 
Mommys Gone. Various messages fol
lowed in the ensuing month.
 September 7th: The Fence was 
painted black, with the message Dave 
Fredericks, 1977-1999, and was un
guarded, although Delta Tau Deltas 
empty shack remained.
 September 8th: Various sorority rush 
messages appeared on the Fence, the 
Delta shack had disappeared, and the 
Fence was unguarded.
 September 9th: unguarded
 September 13th: painted white, no 
message, unguarded.
 September 14th: Construction made 
the Fence unavailable until the end of 
the month. Major excavation probably 
destroyed the root system of the adja
cent tree, which dropped all of its leaves 
the next week, long before any other tree 
on campus showed signs of autumn.
 October 1st: To inaugurate the Fence 
after the construction ended, Kappa 
Delta Rho painted pledge names and 
various phrases about fellatio, includ
ing, Shell Have to Suck It, Eric Sez 
Suck It, and You Have the Option to 
Suck It. This happened to be Homecom
ing Weekend, and these messages 
greeted alumni and families who re
turned to show their pride in CMU.
 October 4th: Phi Kappa Theta 
paints pledge names on the Fence, and 
erects a wooden shanty. They guard the 
Fence until October 14th, painting 
various messages including Fall 99: 
The Countdown Begins, and another 
that referred to the Ambiguously
Gay Duo.
 October 15th: The same shanty re
mains, but now the Fence advertises the 
Kappa Kappa Gong Show.
 October 19th: The same shanty and 
sponsors still rule, but the message ad
vertises an event to be held by the soft
ware company Trilogy.
 November 1st: Various messages 
from PiKA, including one asking 
whether one has ever kissed a Jew.
 November 4th: Publicity for this 
weekends Passage Through India.
As I noted at the outset, I do not 
believe that the Fence ought to be regu
lated by the faculty or administration. 
This is a student matter. I provide the 
information above so that students may 
judge for themselves whether or not this 
venue of free speech is being monopo
lized by a few campus groups.
In closing, earlier this term I sug
gested to one frustrated group of stu
dents that they adopt guerrilla tactics: 
Why not simply show up one midnight 
and erect an alternative Fence some
where else on campus? The group 
that erects an alternative Fence could 
make a no guarding rule if they 
so desired. What possible objection 
could the powers that be raise if stu
dents erected a second  or third  
or tenth  alternative Fence? We toler
ate ugly, rickety shacks that are 
built without authorization; whats 
a few more unauthorized Fences here 
and there?
While thinking about these questions, 
it may be useful to ponder another: Do 
CMU students have anything pressing 
to paint on the Fence? Free speech is a 
useless right if people have nothing im
portant to say.

Universitys imposed meal plan limits freshman options
Thaddeus Billman
What Im about to say should surprise 
no one: Carnegie Mellon Food Services 
sucks. Im not just talking about the 
quality of the food ' the whole 
setup is bad.
First of all, there is the manda
tory nature of the freshman meal 
plan. This is supposedly so that 
freshmen will learn how to eat right. 
Well, it sure doesnt teach that! The 
first thing it teaches is to skip meals.
No matter how you look at it, you 
just cant get 21 meals a week off 
the meal plan; about the best you 
can do is 18, and that is only if you 
really stretch it. So freshmen learn 
that it is a good idea to skip a break
fast here and a lunch there; I dont 
call that a good eating habit. Sec
ondly, it encourages students to eat 
unhealthy food, as Id hardly call 
the options available nutritious.
The mandatory nature of the meal 
plan also sucks because of a little place 
called Highlander. As we all know, this 
place is legendary for bad taste, so bad in 
fact that many, myself included, avoid 
eating there at all costs. This means
that we either have to eat breakfast at 
Schatz or waste the meal block. Due to 
time constraints, sleeping in, etc., this 
often means wasted meal blocks. I, for 
example, routinely waste three meal 
blocks a week. This means I can only eat 
about 14 meals a week, not exactly the
seems that I eat the same thing every 
other day. I mean sure you can pick 
between linguini and penne at Roseli, 
but pasta is pasta. French fries seem to 
be everywhere, as there is hardly a day
I go without. Furthermore, vendors have 
been known to be out of the food I desired

me to develop. choices even further.
As if limiting my choices and 
then limiting them some more 
wasnt bad enough, the re

me with their excruciatingly 
slow service. More often than 
not, Ill have to wait around 10 
minutes after I order before 
the guy behind the counter 
stops goofing off and starts 
making my food. Things dont 
improve much once they start 
on my food, as the apparently 
brain-dead worker moves 
along at a snails pace. To il
lustrate my point, I will take 
two examples from my experi
ence. The first happened at 
Roseli. Both my friend and I 
ordered small pizzas, and af
ter we ordered, we went over 
by the soda to wait. After about 25 min
utes of waiting, we began to notice it was 
taking a long time even for Roseli. A 
pizza was on its way out, so I figured it

Basically, there isnt any. Between the

hard to find a variety of foods to eat. It

Parents move to ban books about fictional boy wizard
Christopher May
Fiction. Its a simple word that 
one would hope all adult Ameri
cans would have a concrete grasp 
of. Unfortunately, it seems that 
this simple assertion is invalid, 
as the controversy over the Harry 
Potter books proves.
Harry Potter is the hero of J. K. 
Rowlings childrens series. He is 
an 11-year-old orphaned wizard 
who attends Hogwarts magic 
academy. His parents were murderedby the evil Lord Voldemort. 
Harry survived the assault with 
merely a lightning-bolt-shaped 
scar on his forehead. He has vari
ous adventures with his two best 
friends, Ron and Hermione. This 
is the plot of the books that some 
adults find so objectionable that 
they are working to have them 
removed from school library 
shelves, and to disallow teachers 
from reading them aloud in class.
The books are incredibly popu
lar, especially among 10- to 13- 
year-olds. Many children who 
previously had shown little in
terest in reading are picking up 
the books and devouring them. 
Teachers are ecstatic to finally
find something that interests chil
dren in reading, and many have 
begun reading aloud these sto
ries in their classrooms.
Despite this ben
efit, since the books 
involve the usage of 
magic, and the prac
ticing of magic is 
against Christian be
liefs, some parents 
will not allow their 
children to hear the 
stories read aloud.
This is acceptable, if 
extreme. However, it 
is not right to remove 
all childrens access 
to these books simply 
due to your own shortsightedness. Addi
tionally, although the 
book talks about 
magic, it is fictionally 
presented. In modern 
society, an ability to 
distinguish reality 
from fantasy is abso
lutely necessary, and 
if parents are worried 
about their childrens inability to 
distinguish those two things, they 
desperately need to teach them 
the difference.
Another argument that parents 
make is that the books are the 
devils work. They point to the
fact that the sales of the books 
are overwhelmingly high, with 
seven million books being sold in 
the United States. This is totally
Justin Suissa/Tartan Assistant Art Editor 
ridiculous. I, for one, couldnt tell 
you how popularity is an indica
tion of satanic influence.
Their final argument is that 
witchcraft is a religion, and as 
such, these books cannot be al
lowed in public schools, due to of that age. This is total rubbish.
separation of church and state. If 
these books were actually books 
about Wicca, then I suppose this 
argument would hold. However 
these books are 
not about religion, 
they are fantasy 
stories about a 
boys adventures. 
Books about ad
ventures with 
magic have been 
written for time 
out of mind.
In addition, I as
sure you that my 
middle-school li
brary contained 
the Chronicles of 
Narnia; indeed, 
my sixth-grade 
teacher read The 
Lion, the Witch 
and the Wardrobe, 
by C.S. Lewis, to 
us. C.S. Lewis is a 
Christian writer, 
and no one will ar
gue that his books 
advocate the 
Christian faith in youths. By this 
argument we would need to throw 
these literary gems out of our 
public school libraries as well.
Finally, they say that these 
books are too violent for children
What about J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord 
of the Rings? I assure you that 
many a seventh-grader has read 
that story of magic and death and 
betrayal, myself included. Once 
they enter middle school, chil
dren begin to be exposed to alco
hol, marijuana, and sex. Escapist 
literature is not a demon that 
parents of children that age need 
to hunt down.
Fantasy literature is not an evil 
which needs to be exorcised from 
the classroom. If parents were 
able to distinguish between real
ity and fiction they would 
realize that the printed word is 
not a knife at the throat of their 
childs innocence. In fact, read
ing is a useful weapon in the 
campaign for childrens intellec
tual development, and escapist 
literature might just keep them 
out of trouble. If some parents 
still arent convinced that a book 
is not necessarily evil because 
it contains magic, then they 
should deny their children access 
to it. But they have no right to 
take that choice away from an
other parent.

Editors Notebook
by Lorelei Laird
Ill admit it: Im the involved type. Ive 
been an OC, Ive been in various media 
organizations, and I even ran for Senate 
once. Its dorky, I know, but I care about 
what happens on campus, and sometimes 
I even help make things happen. My 
fellow involved types and I were there
fore thrilled back in September when 
emu. misc. market exploded with commen
tary and controvery about Student 
Senates resolution on Activities-Feefunded parking passes. Sacre bleul we 
thought. Could it be that the vaunted 
CMU apathy is finally coming to an end? 
Could it be that students actually care 
about campus politics?
Alas, all of us involved types got a rude 
awakening a couple of weeks ago, when 
Student Senate elections were held. De
spite the electronic furor  and the thou
sand-plus signatures on the petition 
against the parking passes  only 552 
students turned out to elect their Stu
dent Senators, a pitiful amount for a
campus that was so politically active just 
a short month ago.
Im not going to give you a long, impas
sioned lecture about how its your world 
and you should care what goes on in it. 
Even if such speeches didnt make me 
physically ill, I would just be preaching to 
the converted (after all, its mostly the 
involved who will bother with this col
umn). But I am going to lay a slight guilt 
trip on those who were 
so willing to piss and 
moan when it was conthe inactive. This semester, weve seen an 
unusually large amount of Senate issues 
provoke the ire of the student body. Of course 
we have the parking passes issue: Should 
the Student Body President, Student Body 
Treasurer, and Senate Chair have parking 
passes paid for out of Activities Fee money? 
After all the righteous indignation on 
cmu.misc.market, Senates Campus Affairs 
committee organized an email survey of ransd pRri ulo. LNGO lr .Lri tvtGgrRt
thfetcnsSStaMe how wittI ImP Nh SI nLtnpuRa N

when it counted. I know 
its hard to show every
one how witty you are 
by checking a box, but 
it doesnt take much 
time, and voting does 
give you the right to 
bitch afterward. Student Senate has even 
made it easy for you by stepping up public
ity efforts hard-core, publishing candi
dates platforms on bboards and in pam
phlets at the elections table. Last semes
ter, they even gave out candy. Short of 
making it into an email-based election, 
the involved types cant do much more to 
make it easy on the apathetic. Weve done 
the groundwork; the rest is up to you.
And its certainly not as if theres a 
shortage of issues to evoke activity among
dom students to gauge student interest on 
the subject. It was a good idea, to be sure, but 
it was hard for CA to find out what students 
thought when the vast majority of the re
sponses were apathetic, vulgar, or just plain 
missing. Then we have the network crack
down, something you can care about even if 
you never get up from behind your PC. I 
dont need to tell you how important the 
Internet and the Andrew intranet are to 
CMU students. For a brief but glorious mo
ment, the bboards were alive with the sounds
of discussion (and flaming). But where 
was the lovin during elections week?
Of course, all this is not to say that 
Senate doesnt need to keep communi
cations open at its end. After all, if 
students have no idea what Senate is up 
to, they can hardly react to it. But for 
the most part, Senate has been espe
cially communicative this semester, 
partly due to the increased efforts of the 
PR committee. Kudos to them, and to 
the Senators who declared their intent 
to increase Senates communication with 
the student body when they were run
ning for office. Keep it up, guys, and 
perhaps the student body will follow.
Probably not, though. All of you who 
were laughing when you saw the head
line will be pleased to know that I am, in 
fact, aware that were at CMU. I know 
that apathy is part of the culture here, 
and frankly, I like the culture here. So I 
dont have any suggestions, but per
haps if Senate continues with this trend 
of communication, more activists will 
crawl out of the woodwork. In the mean
time, we involved types will have to 
content ourselves with trying to find an 
electable personality in George W. Bush 
or A1 Gore.

was one of ours, but nope, it was 
the guy who ordered after us. I 
then looked over to see that they 
had just started making our piz
zas. By the time we actually got 
our pizzas, it had been more than 
40 minutes! A second example is 
from the O. Last time I ordered 
a burger, I decided to watch the 
process. After the burger was 
cooked, I noticed that it took about 
five minutes for anyone to do
anything with it. Then it took 
another five minutes to master 
the complicated task of putting 
the burger on the bun and the 
bun on my tray.
Worse than being slow, the food 
preparation is often poor as well. 
From half-cooked O fries to 
burnt Roseli pizza to who-knowswhat-they-did-to-that High
lander food, the examples are 
nearly endless. But wait, the in
competence doesnt stop there.
There was the cashier who 
charged my friend 30 cents extra 
because he put his soda in a red 
cup instead of a white one, even 
though the cups were the same 
size, and even though the larger 
size only costs 25 cents more to 
begin with! Then there was the 
University staff member who 
somehow couldnt figure out it 
was the end of daylight sayings 
time and didnt bother to warn 
anyone. Consequently, hundreds
of students lost at least one of 
their meal blocks on that day.
The worst part about the whole 
situation is that there is abso
lutely nothing I can do about it. 
For all practical purposes, the 
UC vendors are a monopoly. Of 
course, technically one can spend 
ones DineX at a variety of places 
around campus, but the fact is 
most of the dollars go to the UC 
vendors. They have a virtual 
monopoly. Whats more, it is not
a monopoly they earned through 
honest competition, it is a mo
nopoly given to them by the Uni
versity. And their services are 
forced upon the defenseless fresh
men via the hated meal plan. 
And it is all done in the name of 
good eating habits.
Thaddeus Billman still believes 
that he is always correct. How
ever, he welcomes all attempts to 
prove otherwise.

BCS system still leaves multiple debates
Between the Uprights
by Pete Patterson
In a situation that closely parallels 
Ohio States collapse against Michigan 
State last year, Penn State fell out of the 
national title hunt with a loss to Minne
sota on Saturday. In both cases, it was a 
game at home against a mediocre oppo
nent. Ohio State got caught looking 
ahead to a looming match-up against 
arch-rival Michigan, while Penn State 
was no doubt peeking ahead to upcom
ing games against tough Michigan and 
Michigan State teams. Either way, the 
Big Ten prematurely lost a legitimate 
shot at a national title for the second 
consecutive year.
As a result of Penn States loss, you 
can bet the folks at the BCS are breath
ing a big sigh of relief. They got bailed 
out of what looked like a logjam at the 
top of the polls last year with late losses 
by OSU, Kansas State, and UCLA, and 
Penn States loss has helped alleviate a 
growing group of teams competing for 
the top spot this season. As of now, any 
two teams among a group consis
ting of Florida State, Virginia Tech, 
Mississippi State, Florida, Tennessee, 
and Kansas State could end up playing 
for the title. This group will be pared 
down to at the most four by seasons
end, as only the SEC champion will 
be a factor
Even if the championship picture 
somehow becomes crystal clear, I still 
dont like the system. There are two 
main reasons for this. Before I explain 
these, I guess a small explanation about 
the rules concerning the BCS is in order. 
Ill just give a brief summary 
since the system is nearly as 
complex as the incomprehensible 
method for calculating quarter
back ratings in the NFL. For a 
full dissertation, you can visit 
http://www.abccfb.go.com/road/ 
rules.html, the official BCS rules 
site. Basically, there are four 
aspects to a teams ranking: 
Win/Loss record, Computer 
Rankings, Strength of Schedule, 
and the Polls. These four compo
nents are added together, and at 
the end of the season, the two 
teams with the best scores play 
for the national title. This years 
match-up is being hosted by the 
Sugar Bowl.
Looking at the procedure for 
coming up with a ranking helps 
illustrate my first concern with 
the system. Human opinion is 
responsible for only one-fourth 
of a teams ranking. This is a growing 
trend in sports today, the idea that we 
need computers to make sense of our 
games. Another example of this is the 
return of the instant replay system to 
the NFL, despite the knowledge that the 
first time around the costs of taking time 
to review calls outweighed the benefits 
of a scant number of ovrtumed plays 
every season. I finally realized how bad
things are getting last week when I read 
a column on espn.com saying that there 
should be a mathematical formula in 
place to determine the winner of the 
Heis-man Trophy.
Where is this maniacal desire to have 
all uncertainties taken out of sports 
headed? Before long, I can see somebody
wanting to merely enter the attributes 
of each player on opposing teams into a 
computer and have the computer decide 
the best team without the game actually 
being played. Getting back to the BCS, I 
think that the polls should determine at 
least three-fourths, if not all, of the cham
pionship picture.
The complaint against this in the past 
was that the people voting on the polls
couldnt see enough of each team to make 
a rational judgement about which team 
is the best. However, I dont think this 
argument is valid in this day and age 
where every big game is on television 
and highlights of the games are shown 
around the clock every Saturday and 
Sunday. Also, the overuse of mathemati
cal formulas encour
ages teams to run up 
scores on opponents in 
an attempt to fool the 
computer about their 
supposed strength.
This leads to my sec
ond complaint with the 
BCS system; which is 
that it is too inflexible. 
For instance, if every 
writer and coach in the 
country believed that 
Virginia Tech was the 
best team in the country 
this season, they could 
still end up being left 
out in the cold come 
championship time had 
two teams with stron.ger schedules also fin
ished undefeated. Also, 
the system eliminates 
any possibility of a 
shared national championship. What 
happens if Virginia Tech squeaks past 
FSU in the anointed national title game 
and Kansas State spanks Tennessee by 
40 to also finish undefeated? They now 
would have no shot at a share of the title, 
while the old system would give them at 
least a partial championship. This stems 
from the second obsession of sports fans 
these days, which is to have a clear-cut
Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff
national champion with no doubt as to 
their supremacy. This is what is driving 
much of the playoff talk in college foot
ball, which I have used this space to 
speak against previously.
In my mind, much of the entertain
ment in college football is provided by 
debating the worthiness of my school 
against yours. The BCS is superficially 
trying to take this away, saying it is 
providing definitive answers when it 
really is not. Computers are much better 
than humans at crunching large 
amounts of numbers and figuring out 
complex mathematical problems, but I 
sincerely believe humans are better at 
judging football teams. Football is an 
imperfect game played imperfectly with 
an incalculable number of contingencies 
possible on every play, so the idea that a 
mathematical formula can determine 
which team is the best is unrealistic. So 
what is my solution? I say go back to the ; 
old two-poll system, one by the writers 
and one by the coaches. Take the 
weighted rankings at the end of the 
season to determine which teams are 
deemed the top two in the nation, and 
require they play each other. Leave open 
the possibility for a shared title by recog
nizing the winner of each poll at the end 
of the season as a champion. This has 
about as much of a chance of happening ! 
as Bob Davie has of winning coach of the 
year honors, but this fan at least would 
be pleased with such a change.
Pete Patterson is a junior IDS major. 
He appreciates all thoughtful responses 
to his column, but will only respond to 
the one his computer determines to be 
better than all the rest.Writer reflects on recent sporting tragedies
Remembering Heroes
by Matt Brun
They say that tragedies hap
pen in threes. The sports world 
would have been lucky to have 
this be the case last week.
In the span of a month, the 
sports world lost two legends, one 
of the classiest athletes of all time, 
and an established athlete on the 
verge of superstardom. The four
some each played different sports, 
had widely varying personalities, 
and will be missed for varying 
reasons, but each will be missed 
by more than just followers of 
their respective sports.
The first in this series of tragic 
losses came back on October 12 
when legendary center Wilt 
Chamberlain died in his Los 
Angles home of congestive heart 
failure at age 63. Wilt the Stilt 
will long be remembered as one of 
the greatest players to ever play 
the game of basketball. Certainly, 
he will be remembered for the 
night he poured in 100 points 
against the New York Knicks. 
Unfortunately, after his playing 
career ended, Chamberlain was 
mentioned for his failure to con
sistently beat rivals Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell 
rather than the two NBA cham
pionships he won and the 50-plus 
league records he set.
We can only hope that Cham
berlain will be remembered in 
death for his qualities as a per
son, rather than the negative as
pects of his life as a player that 
haunted him during retirement. 
It was his gentle personality, be
lying his gigantic stature, that
led to many of the undeserved 
criticisms of his playing career. 
As a 7'1" giant, Chamberlain 
knew he was bigger and stronger 
than everyone else, but rather 
than use his size advantage to 
bully others, he used his physical 
abilities cautiously, almost tim
idly, to avoid harming others.
His stature also biased the fans 
perception of him, producing im
possible expectations that he was 
forever trying to live up to. He 
was criticized for failing to lead 
his Philadelphia 76ers past 
Russells Boston Celtics. The 
match-ups between the Celtics 
and 76ers were never just two 
teams against each other, but one 
playerChamberlainagainst 
the other team. Russell andthe 
Celtics were expected to beat ev
eryone else, but Chamberlain was 
expected to upset the Boston jug
gernaut single-handedly.
Even after finally leading Phila
delphia  and later the Los An
geles Lakers  to the title, 
Chamberlains efforts were 
brushed off with a dismissive 
statement that it was no chal
lenge to win with a player of his 
size. This legacy is unfitting for a 
man of Chamberlains character, 
and it will be a greater tragedy if 
he is remembered in death the 
way he was in life.
Two weeks to the day after 
Chamberlains passing, the sports 
world was shocked yet again when 
the news that golfer Payne 
Stewarts private jet had crashed 
and everyone on board had been 
killed on impact. Even more than 
with Chamberlain, who had 
passed away peacefully from 
natural causes, the news of 
Stewarts untimely death shocked 
the sports world, and much of the 
rest of the world as well.
The passing of one of the worlds 
most caring and genteel person
alities was made all the more 
poignant by the fact that if it had
happened a few years before, 
hardly anyone outside his family 
probably would have cared. When 
he first burst on the PGA tour 
scene, Stewart was a brash, arro
gant loudmouth with a naturally 
perfect swing, multiple endorse
ment deals, and those obnoxious
was the caring guy with the 
quaint, traditional knickers.
Stewarts legacy is one of a de
voted husband and truly compas
sionate human being. He is also 
proof that people can change 
themselves for the better if they 
just put forth the effort.
knickers. Then, the rarest of 
events occurred: He reformed.
Hardly ever does a professional 
athlete realize the error of his 
ways and actively take steps to 
become a normal person again. 
In Stewarts case, the change not 
only started, it took. Over the 
past couple of seasons, Stewart
As if the loss of two such be
loved figures wasnt tragic 
enough, 24-year old CART driver
Greg Moore was killed in a crash 
during qualifying for a race just 
five days after Stewarts plane 
crashed. The world of auto racing 
has had its share of tragic deaths 
in its long history, but the loss of 
Moore, a rising star on the CART 
circuit, was especially touching, 
if just for its timing.
Moores accident 
was actually the sec
ond fatal crash on the 
CART circuit this 
year, following an in
cident on September
11 in which Gonzalo 
Rodriguez was killed 
during a practice run. 
The accidents again 
brought up the topic 
of whether auto rac
ing is really safe, a 
debate which has 
raged for some time.
While crashes like 
the ones involving 
Rodriguez and Moore 
draw attention to the 
dangers of the sport, 
they are still quite in
frequent. Its true 
that two fatal crashes 
in one year seems like 
a lot, but taken as 
part of the larger pic
ture, the accidents 
were two of just three 
fatal accidents on the 
CART circuit in the 
last 17 years.
Only a few laps be
fore Moores acci
dent, another driver 
crashed in practically 
the same spot on the 
track at the same speed of 230 
mph and walked away completely 
unharmed. In a very ironic twist,
Moore had given an interview 
just two days earlier in which he 
stated confidence in the safety of 
the cars. The cars are as safe as 
they can be, he said. [But] things 
happen at [230 mph].
The day after Moores crash, 
tragedy struck once again when 
Walter Payton, the NFLs all-time 
leading rusher, died at age 45 of 
bile duct cancer. The cancer 
struck as a result of the effects of 
primary sclerosing cholangitis, a 
rare liver disease that had caused 
Payton to be placed on the wait
list for a liver transplant.
Throughout his struggle with 
the disease, Payton persevered 
as he had on the field for 16 sea
sons, with an iron-willed deter
mination to simply outwork his 
opposition. Through those 16 pro ; 
seasons, Payton missed just one 
game and never quit on a single 
play. Though not blessed with 
the power and speed of Hall of 
Famer Jim Brown, Payton wore ; 
down defenders to the point where 
they could no longer chase him, 
and chipped away at Browns 
record, finally breakingit in 1984.
Along with his excellence on 
the field, Payton will be remem
bered for his unassuming nature 
and the work ethic that charac
terized his career and his life. It 
was impossible not to like him, 
and he earned the respect of ev
eryone who saw him play.
While the sporting world will 
suffer from the loss of these great 
athletes, the rest of the world will 
suffer from the loss of a group of 
such fine human beings.

Organizations which did not participate in the Spring budget process have the opportunity to 
submit a budget for the Fall budget process. In order to submit a budget, an organization or specific 
activity must be recognized as funded.
Due to recent changes in the Constitution of the Student Body, non-funded organizations can 
request budgets for "funded activities". Examples of such funded activities include Booth and Buggy 
programs.
The process for requesting a budget begins with contacting the Chair of the Joint Funding 
Committee (mjeske+) with your intent to submit a budget. You will soon afterward be assigned a 
member of the Joint Funding Committee as a liason to assist you in preparing your budget.
Budget proposals are due November 15th by 5pm. After the JFC votes on the budgets, there 
will be an opportunity for appeals. Finally, the budgets will be approved by a joint session of the 
Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly in December.

Ice hockey wins 
second straight
By ERIN LUCAS
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Sunday, Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity hosted Penn State West at the 
Island Sports Complex located on Neville 
Island. The game was a close, hardfought contest as both teams earned 
Numerous scoring opportunities. Carniegie Mellon was clearly the dominant 
team, however, as witnessed by their 4- 
P victory.
; The offense more than did its part for 
the game, but much of the credit for the 
,win also must go to the Tartan defense 
; | most notably graduate student 
goaltender Ryan Henningfor earning 
;the shutout.
The first period was a close, but rela
tively uneventful, 20 minutes of action. 
Although both teams played well, nei
ther had anything to show for it at the 
first intermission. The only outbreak of 
excitement from the Tartan bench came 
at 0:56 when Carnegie Mellons star 
defenseman senior Cliff Brangwynne 
received a game misconduct penalty. 
The Tartan defense was able to kill the 
PSW power play with little difficulty to 
keep the score 0-0.
Coming out strong after the break, 
Carnegie Mellon played outstanding 
hockey during the second period. While 
only having to serve one minor penalty, 
the Tartans were able to add three goals 
'to their tally in the second period alone.
The first goal came at 13:18 when 
first-year first-line center Rob Ready 
scored a goal with an assist from sopho
more defenseman Eliot Minichello. 
Carnegie Mellon continued to domi
nate, although their next goal did not 
come until 6:43 when Ready scored his 
second goal of the period, assisted by 
graduate student Constantine 
Davidies. Only 30 seconds later, 
Davidies buried the puck behind the 
PSW goaltender.
Play slowed down in the third period 
as more penalties were delegated, 
causing a severe drop in scoring. Re
gardless, Carnegie Mellon won this 
period as well with an unassisted 
goal from senior captain Dan Grosso 
at 14:29.
The Tartan defense  composed of 
Brangwynne, Minichello, graduate 
student Chris Schmidt, first-year stu
dent Noble Shore, sophomore Chris 
Kennedy, and first-year student James 
Hookall played outstanding games. 
In addition, despite being screened, 
knocked over, and thrust in the middle 
of heavy traffic in front of the net, 
goaltender Henning made next-to-impossible saves look easy throughout 
the game.
The Tartans record now stands at 
6-2. Their next game will be at the 
Island Sports Complex on Friday, 
November 12 when they will play host 
to Robert Morris College.

TT: What are your goals with respect 
to tennis during your time here at CMU?
JH: I had played a whole lot of junior 
tennis, and I was honestly starting to 
get burned out. I was starting to wonder 
if I should play at all competitively in 
college. Plus, I was worried about the 
work factor here. I didnt know if I 
wanted to put myself in a difficult situ
ation. But now that Im playing, my 
main goal is to have fun. Im not really 
looking at the results. Its cool to do 
well, but Im not looking to become 
a national champion or anything 
like that.
KF: Right now, Im just looking to see 
how far we can get. I think that the 
national championships are within 
reach, so that is the goal for me. I have a 
really fun time playing tennis 
competitively, so competing well and 
hopefully doing well is fun. I just set my 
goals to do as much as I can do. I just 
have fun doing it. My goal while Im here 
is to try to win the national 
championship. We now know the 
other players in our division, and its 
definitely not an unrealistic goal 
at all.
TT: How do you feel about the tennis 
team as a whole?
KF: The older players have been really 
helpful. We have four first-years so we 
have a pretty young team. We still have
a whole year to mature and get better. 
Coach has already been giving some 
pretty optimistic outlooks for this sea
son. He says we should be in the finals of 
UAA if we play well.
TT: How do you feel about playing a 
sport at CMU?
JH: We havent had a home match and 
were not going to. Normally we dont 
have home matches, but I think were 
trying to change that for the spring. Its 
kind of hard to have fan support for 
away matches. Ive found that 
practices are kind of relaxed. I know a 
lot of Division I schools work you really 
hard, but I havent felt over
worked here.
TT: What do you think of sports in 
general at CMU?
KF: In general, the only thing I miss is 
that on Saturdays the whole school 
doesnt get excited about a single event 
like a football game or basketball game. 
Im from Texas, and we get five or six 
thousand at a football game. We need 
some computer science majors 
running around without their shirts on 
game day to make it feel more 
college-like.
TT: How have you found it to balance 
academics and tennis during your 
first semester?
JH: Personally, if I werent playing 
tennis, Id be stuck indoors all day. I 
dont do too many outdoor activities be
sides tennis, so its a good opportunity 
for me to be outside.
KF: For me, Id be doing it anyway ' 
even if I werent on the team. Ive just 
chosen to spend the free time I have here 
to play tennis.
TT: What has surprised you most about 
tennis here?
KF: One thing that Ive found to be 
really weird is that there are a lot of 
really good tennis players at CMU that 
dont play on the tennis team. Were 
trying to find those players. Its kind of 
surprising to see how many people have 
played competitive tennis as a junior 
and just decided to stop to take it easy 
here and concentrate on studies. But the 
thing is, you usually do better at both ; 
when you play tennis and study. There ; 
are people weve seen out on the courts \ 
that wed like to get on the tennis team. !
TT: What are you looking towards in ! 
the future, beyond CMU?
JH: All of the goals I have set have just 
been for college. I havent really looked 
much past that. I dont even know if Ill 
play competitive tennis after college. 1 
Thats a time when Ill either go to gradu; 
ate school or look for a job or something j 
like that. Ill have to get all of that 
figured out.
KF: I cant see myself playing competi
tive tennis after college. But I also cant 
see myself not playing any tennis at all.
I think it will just be recreational.Swim teams dominate through three meets

The men's team dominated the field at the Harvest Relays, setting six 
meet records and winning eight out of 10 events.
begun to make a name for them
selves this season continued that 
trend by impressing during the 
meet as well. First-year student 
Libby Williams  second in the 
500-yard freestyle against 
Wittenberg and Franklin and
relay along with junior Beth 
Reckdenwald, and sophomores 
Alexandra Schmidt and Miya 
Muraki (1:54.06).
With their 4-0 records set, the 
teams traveled to Rochester for 
the annual Harvest Relays. This
meet was comprised entirely of 
relay events, including diving 
teams of two or three that were 
scored on six total team dives.
The meet was a lot of fun since 
every diver likes to swim relays, 
Belowich said.
The fun aspects of the meet 
helped set off the timeframe the 
teams had to endure. The divers 
began warm-ups at 8:30 am, and 
the final event finally finished 
at 6 pm.
Out of 11 total teams, CMU 
placed very well, continuing their 
string of impressive results. The 
women took second to SUNY 
Geneseo in a contest that wasnt 
decided until the final event. To 
earn a tie for first, CMU needed 
to win the final event and have 
Geneseo finish third or lower. 
CMU held up their end with a 
win, but Geneseo came in second 
and held off the Tartans by one 
point in the final standings. De
fending champion Ithaca rounded 
out the top three.
On their way to the secondplace finish, the Tartans won the 
final two events of the meet. In 
the 200-yard medley relay, the 
team of Tseng, Rockwell, 
Hildebrand, and Andrew took the 
win with a time of 1:55.10. The 
final event, the 8x25-yard 
freestyle relay, was brought home 
by Hildebrand, Ho-Walker, An
drew, Tseng, Rockwell, Costlow, 
Reckdenwald, and first-year stu
dent Audra Pomeani with a time 
of 1:36.29.
All in all, it was a very good 
meet, Belowich said. We repre
sented ourselves very well.
The men turned in a phenom
enal meet, according to Belowich, 
setting six meet records in the 10 
events on their way to their fourth 
straight meet win. CMU finished 
with a score of 189, easily outpac
ing Alfred and St. Lawrence, who 
tied for second with 161 points.
The first meet record came in 
the meets first event, the 400- 
yard medley relay. The team of 
Robinson, Peters, Heidinger, and 
Belowich set the new meet stan
dard of 3:37.86. Next came the
300-yard breaststroke medley 
where Striner, Peters, and junior 
Andrew Gardner set a new record 
of 3:05.74.
Robinson, Belowich, Shuchuck, 
and Peters then teamed up to set 
another new record, this time in 
the 200-yard freestyle relay 
(1:27.61). Next up was the team 
of Striner, Peters, and junior Rob 
Gallagher in the 600-yard IM re
lay (6:12.20). Belowich, Robinson, 
Striner, and Heidinger set the 
record in the 200-yard medley 
relay at 1:38.71. The final record 
came in the 8x25-yard freestyle 
from the grouping of Gallagher, 
Shuchuck, Alpert, Belowich, 
Heidinger, Peters, Robinson, and
junior Jon Hurst (1:19.65).
All in all, the men won all but 
two of the meets events. When j 
you set that many records, 
youre swimming very well, i 
said Belowich.
Up next for the Tartans is the 
annual mini-UAA invitational. 
The top four teams in the UAA 
Emory, NYU, Johns Hopkins, and 
CMU  will get together in the 
UC pool for a two-day event 
that could be a preview of the. 
UAA meet. This is probably our;, 
biggest meet of the year outside:!! 
the UAA championships,3?::' 
Belowich said. It should be a,. 
real good meet for all of the 
teams involved.

Swim teams hit stride early on in season
Mens tennis duo earns 
All-American team spot
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Acting Managing Editor
Men's tennis doubles partners 
Kayvon Fatahalian, a first-year com
puter science major, and Jonathan Hui, 
a first-year electrical and computer 
engineering major, recently earned a 
spot on the 1999All-American team as 
a doubles tandem. They received this 
honor after winning the Mens Open 
Doubles bracket of the ITA Mens. 
East Championship at Swarthniore 
College over the weekend of October 1- 
3. The Tartan recently sat down 
with Fatahalian and Hui to talk about 
tennis ingenerai, this award, sports at 
CMU, and their hopes and goals for 
the future.
The Tartan : How did you get started 
playing tennis?
John Hui: I have to go by what my 
parents told me, because I honestly 
dont remember. I got started at ten
nis when I was about six years old. 
My dad used to play a lot of tennis  
recreationally, though, not competi
tively. One time, we went to a tennis 
camp. He gave me a racket, and I just 
liked hitting the ball, so I continued 
on. I started playing local tourna
ments when I was 12.
Kayvon Fatahalian: I think I also 
picked up a racket for the first time at 
six, and my dad was also a recre
ational player. I didnt start playing 
any serious tennis until I was 12.
TT: Did you always have a special 
talent for tennis?
JH: I think its mostly that I played 
a lot. A lot of people played tennis. Its 
just that not as many people played 
as much tennis as I did.
TT: When did you first hear that 
you were selected All-American?
JH: The first I heard of it was 
when Kevin Chan, a junior on our 
tennis team, told me that we 
reached All-American status. He 
told me to check out a Web site that 
said all the regional champions 
of Division III were selected as 
All-Americans.
TT: How did you feel when you 
found out?
KF: For me personally, I thought 
it was neat, but the real tourna
ments that really count in our sched
ule are in the spring. If we do well 
in those, it will be much more im
portant than anything weve done 
in the fall. Its a nice place to start, 
so theres not such a huge hill to 
climb for the spring.

The women's soccer team ended the season on October 31 with a hard-fought 3-2 
overtime loss to UAA rival Case Western Reserve University.

Tartan Sports Editor
Early-season meets are usually 
accompanied by slower times 
from the competitors, which then 
improve as the season wears on. 
If thats so, then the rest of the 
countrys Division III swimming 
programs should be shaking in 
their Speedos based on the re
sults the CMU squads have 
turned in over their first meets.
After taking 24 out of 34 pos
sible first-place finishes in their 
season-opening matches against 
Wittenberg and Franklin and 
Marshall, the Tartans squads got 
to relax a little bit going into their 
second set of matches against 
Gannon and Grove City.
Not facing the same level of 
competition as against 
Wittenberg and Franklin and 
Marshall, the Tartans went out 
against Gannon and Grove City 
with an excess of confidence. De
spite not turning in times as fast 
as the results in the first meet, 
the Tartans dominated again, 
winning both decisions in the 
double dual meet convincingly.
Swimming against over
matched teams, the Tartans used 
the opportunity to switch around 
the lineup a little bit and give 
some of the younger swimmers 
'some extra experience. As a tes
tament to the Tartans depth, 
neither squad missed a beat, even 
with the shuffled rosters.
The teams werent going to be 
as strong as [Wittenberg and 
Franklin and Marshall], so we 
moved things around, head coach 
David Belowich said.
Both the mens and 
womens squads swept 
the double dual meet, and 
none of the four contests 
was close. The men beat 
Gannon 138-69 and 
Grove City 14473, and 
the women won 157-83 
over Gannon and 156-77 
over Grove City.
With the new roster, 
many of the Tartans 
strongest swimmers had 
their workloads cut back 
some. Senior Mike 
Robinsona three-event 
winner in the first meet
 entered three events 
against Gannon and 
Grove City, winning the 
50-yard freestyle and 
100-yard freestyle events 
with times of 22.15 sec
onds and 47.84 seconds, 
respectively, and teaming with 
juniors Jonathan Hurst and Jon 
Alpert and sophomore Matt 
Shewchuk to take second in the 
200-yard freestyle relay. Alpert 
also continued to impress, win
ning the 200-yard freestyle 
with a time of 1:48.66, and finish
ing second to Robinson in the 
100-yard freestyle, just two sec
onds behind.
Other multiple winners for the 
men included juniors George
butterfly with a time of 52.84 
seconds, while Belowich finished 
second in the 200-yard individual 
medley with a time of 2:04.00. 
Peters just edged out Belowich in 
the 200-yard IM with a time of 
2:01.81, and added a second-place
Heidinger and Ian Peters, who 
teamed up with junior Rob 
Gallagher and sophomore Sean 
Belowich to win the 200-yard 
freestyle relay in 1:27.48. 
Heidinger also won the 100-yard
finish in the 100-yard backstroke. 
Peters time in the backstroke 
was 56.48 seconds, a miniscule 
0.29 seconds behind Steve 
Johnston of Grove City, who 
took first.
The divers swept their two 
events. Sophomore Brandon 
May won the one-meter, and se
nior John Hsieh won the 
three-meter.
Several of the younger swim
mers also took advantage of the 
opportunity to show 
their talents. Junior 
Nathan Palm, sopho
more Landon Fears, and 
first-year students 
Duncan Carroll and Billy 
Gaines teamed up to win 
the 200-yard medley re
lay in 1:41.24, closely fol
lowed by the team com
prised of senior Mike 
Onofray and juniors Ja
son Striner, Rob 
Gallagher, and Jonathan 
Hurst, who took third 
with a time of 1:44.49.
Striner also won the 
100-yard breaststroke 
with a time of 1:01.80, 
and Gaines added a win 
in the 500-yard freestyle 
(4:58.05) and a thirdplace finish in the 200- 
yard freestyle (1:50.63). 
Other notables from 
the Tartan squad included sopho
more Jim Artz (two third-place 
finishes), junior Mike Snow (a 
fifth and a fourth), and sopho-' 
more Mike Monyok (second in 
the 1000-yard freestyle). '
Our team has a lot of versatil
ity, so we can put people in differ
ent events, Belowich said. Its 
good for the swimmers because 
it keeps them fresh, and good for 
the team since we can be 
more flexible.
The women also shuffled their 
lineup a bit, but still had equally 
impressive results. Traditional 
team leaders senior Erin 
Rockwell and junior Julie Tseng 
gave typical strong performances
 Tseng won the 1000-yard 
freestyle in 11:10.71 and the 500- 
yard freestyle in 5:26.03, and 
Rockwell won the 200-yard 
freestyle (2:04.28), the 100-yard 
breaststroke (1:10.12), and 
teamed with junior Becky 
Hildebrand, sophomore Monica 
Costlow, and first-year student 
Mei-Lan Ho-Walker to win 
the 200-yard medley relay 
with 1:57.38.
Hildebrand also gave a strong 
showing, taking first in the 100- 
yard butterfly in 1:03.53 and 
teaming with Tseng, Costlow, and 
first-year student Audra Pomeani 
to take first in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay with a time of 
1:44.85. Ho-Walker had an 
equally impressive meet, taking 
third in the 50-yard freestyle in 
26.88 seconds and second in the 
100-yard freestyle with a time of

Tartans fight way back into UAA title hunt
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
With the end of the 1999 season draw
ing near, it was gut-check time for the 
Carnegie Mellon football squad. After 
falling behind the Washington Univer
sity of St. Louis Bears in the UAA cham
pionship race, the Tartans needed a win 
over UAA member Rochester to keep 
any hopes of a shared title alive.
The game started out innocently 
enough as both teams went three-andout on their first possessions. On 
Rochesters second possession, however,

they pieced together a 13-play march 
downfield for the games opening touch
down. No play on the drive went for
longer than 20 yards, and the drive killed 
4:25 off the clock. The two-point conver
sion attempt failed, leaving the score 6-
0 Rochester.
CMU finally got some momentum 
started late in the quarter when sopho
more quarterback Eric Zimpfer broke a 
second-and-eight run for 47 yards to the 
Rochester 10-yard line. The Tartans 
pounded the ball down to the one as time 
ran out in the quarter, and senior full
back Mike Campie plunged in on the 
first play of the second quarter to tie the 
game. The extra point gave the Tartans 
a lead they would not relinquish the rest 
of the game.
Rochesters ensu
ing possession 
ended abruptly 
with an intercep
tion by junior Lou 
DePaul. Starting at 
the Rochester 45- 
yard line, the Tar
tans moved to
wards the end zone 
quickly on a 36- 
yard pass from 
Zimpfer to junior 
Mike McLaughlin. 
Campie finished off 
the drive with his 
second touchdown 
run, making the 
score 14-6 CMU.
Rochester struck back on their next 
possession, but had to settle for a field 
goal after the CMU defense held on firstand-goal from the eight yard line. The 
teams traded punts for the rest of the 
quarter, and at halftime, the score was 
14-9 in favor of the Tartans.
CMU got off to a fast start in the 
second half, scoring on their first posses
sion on Zimpfers 22-yard pass to senior 
running back Mike Monsilovich. CMU 
attempted a two-point conversion, but 
Zimpfers pass was intercepted in the 
end zone.
Rochester caught a break on their next 
possession to close the gap. After the 
Tartans forced a punt, junior Jared Win
chester fumbled the return, giving Roch
ester the ball on the CMU 7-yard hne. 
Rochester scored two plays later, mak
ing the score 20-15 CMU.
CMU opened the fourth quarter with 
a 41-yard field goal to extend their lead 
to eight points. On Rochesters next pos
session, Winchester atoned for his ear
lier mistake by forcing and recovering a 
fumble on the CMU nine-yard line. On 
the Tartans first play of the drive, 
Zimpfer and McLaughlin connected on 
the play of the game, a 91-yard touch
down pass that put the Tartans 
ahead 30-15.
The Tartans forced two more turn
overs to hold their lead, and set the final 
score at 33-15 with a field goal midway 
through the quarter.

By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
While Friday evenings show was no ride on a 
300-kilometer-per-hour French Train a Grande 
Vitesse, Mayurs Passage Through India was 
just like a real Indian Railways trip across India:
It was never on time and experienced numerous 
technical difficulties, but was at the end of the 
day a very memorable and enjoyable experience.
Mayur pulled out all the stops for their three-anda-half-hour epic presentation. Consisting of four 
parts, the show presented the audience with a 
richly textured presentation of the many dynam
ic aspects of one of the worlds most 
populated cultures.
Mayur wasted no time in drawing the capacity 
audience into the show when they started out 
with an Indian dance that blended modern newage music with classical dress and dance. Upon 
conclusion of the opening dance, Mayur represen
tative Siddharth Gejji, a senior business adminis
tration major welcomed the audience to their 
train ride across India. The shows organizers 
came up with a unique way in which to guide the 
audience on their journey.
Between each artistic presentation, throughout 
most of the evening, three or four passengers 
would appear on the stage in a dialogue that 
would set up the next act. These passengers gave 
.the audience a context for the presentations, as 
well as a dose of comic relief. The evening was 
;peppered with musical numbers, skits, and 
dances. The first song was a pop song titled 
Tamil Pop Song from the Tamil movie Ajooba.
Continuing on the journey through southern 
India, the audience was presented with an enter
taining skit about a bandit on a train that effec
tively demonstrated the clash between modern 
and traditional India. The journey through South 
India concluded with a presentation of a tradi
tional Carnatic, or South Indian, religious pieceand a dance titled Bharatanatyam.
The second act of the show brought the audi
ence on a vibrant tour through East India, a 
region famous for its dynamic weather and wild 
beauty. The act started off with a Bengali folk 
dance before performers sang the Rabindra 
Sangeet Song which included poetry of 
Rabindranath Tagore, the first Nobel laureate of 
India. Concluding the act was a short piece that 
elated the culture clashes that often take place. lGuGpu ompcsimai/ laiian mutu Oldl I
tween Indians of different origins. Mayur members perforin a traditional Indian dance as part of Mayurs Passage Through India, a three hour program which presented Indias many facets.
The second half of the show was well-orches
trated, and the audience responded more enthu
siastically to it than to the first half. Northern 
India was the next stop on A Passage Through 
India, and kicked off with the fast-paced and col
orful Bhangra Dance. This folk dance from the 
northern state of Punjab is often sung in praise of 
a woman, and was performed to songs by Daler 
Mehndi and Arun Pandit. The Bhangra Dance 
was immediately followed by a graceful folk 
dance from the northern state of Rajasthan 
called Ghoomer Dance. These love-story dances 
are typically sung by women, and this particular
dance was performed to Resham Ka Rumal, by 
Ila Arun. Concluding the North India segment 
was a brilliant song titled Dekha na hai re 
Socha na hai, in which three men sing in Hindi 
about the great extents to which they would go 
for their loves.
The concluding segment about West India 
first brought the viewers a dynamic 
Garba/Raas dance in which the dancers 
uniquely use sticks in their performance. The 
evening concluded with a short skit in which a 
Bollywood producer is making a movie and 
needs music and dancing. He calls for a band
called Indian Spice to perform a song from a 
famous Hindi movie. Finally Mayur presented 
a modern dance which combined elements of 
India with American and Western dancing, and 
was performed to the song Hame Na Bolana 
from the movie Hogi Pyaar Ki Jeet, and music 
from the movie Taal.
Student reaction to the show was enthusiastic. 
I thought the entire evening was breathtaking, 
despite the length, said Mayhew Seavey III, a 
sophomore computer science major. I really felt 
like I was traveling through this colorful and 
exciting country.

A student dressed up as a character from his favorite Blur music video.
By LISETTE MILLER-DIXON
Tartan Contributing Editor
Traditionally, artists and photogra
phers have had humble beginnings. 
Stories that start with borrowing cam
eras, taking snapshots, learning basic 
black-and-white in a high school dark
room, and finding inspiration through 
commercial photography are common 
to the majority of people who go into 
photography. Wingtat Yu, a first-year 
graduate in the Heinz School of Public 
Management, has a similar back
ground in the art form. Inspiration 
from an old copy of Harpers Bazaar led 
Yu to his interest in and love of fashion 
photography. After a summer shooting 
for free at a Florida model agency, Yus 
dream to be a fashion photographer 
was further affirmed.
In Yus most recent exhibit, 
Creatures. at the University 
Center Art Gallery, the artist 
attempts to reveal a fantasy world of 
beautiful people and to talk about 
human individuality.
T am interested in anything that cre
ates a mood and fantasy, said Yu. I 
thought that I should pay tribute to 
beautiful people.
The eighteen 11 x 14 inch black and 
white photographs are displayed in 
simple black frames with cream-col
ored window mattes. The artists state
ment and a large black sign outside the 
gallery are the only hints of what the 
project could mean to the artist and for 
the viewer. According to Yu, the idea for 
the show evolved from a desire to pre
serve a timelessness among beautiful 
young people who, in some cases, are 
very unaware of their own individual 
beauty. Verses included in the poster 
for the exhibit include: They are strik
ingly handsome. Children by the hands 
of beauty. Natural as the rain ... they 
must be Creatures. These verses were 
written as inspiration for the pho
tographs, said Yu.
The photographs all have a very soft 
focus to them. The models are all 
dressed in similar white dress shirts 
with low-cut necklines and black pants. 
The stylish yet simple clothing helps 
take the photographs out of a fine art 
realm and into a fashion realm. 
Several images taken on the hillsides 
of Schenley Park have the models lying 
sprawled out on the ground with nice
attention paid to the negative and pos
itive spaces of the earth and sky tones. 
Two other photographs, one of a male 
model, and one of a female, have an 
integration with the model and the 
bark on trees. Because of the simplicity 
of expression in the models faces and 
their clothes, the use of texture works 
well as a prop. Further integration 
with nature is exemplified through 
photographs of barefoot models.
One of the models, senior electrical 
and computer engineering major Kush 
Tyagi, explained his experience with 
the project.
TVagi met Yu in a cluster three years 
prior to the exhibit and they became 
acquainted. He asked me if I wanted 
to model and, flattered, I said I would. 
I knew he was a really good' photogra
pher and that he had really good work. 
During the opening it was a little weird 
seeing your own picture up.
According to TVagi, he heard several 
people commenting on how many of the 
photographs looked like they were 
Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren ads.
Yus next project is a collaborative 
concept working with another graduate 
student to form a fashion magazine 
which will be called Filter. If all goes 
well with funding, each monthly issue 
will have a 6-7-page photo spread along 
with student-written and designed 
pieces. Ideally, Yu said, the magazine 
will be focused enough on college stu
dents lifestyles that it will be able to 
compete with other universities that 
have similar publications.
In the future, Yu hopes that he can 
be a photographer for a fashion mag
azine, like Vogue or Harpers Bazaar. 
Having had this opportunity to put a 
fashion project together for himself 
instead of a fashion establishment, Yu 
said in his artists statement, The 
self-assigned project serves as an out
let for my creative energy and11 
enjoyed doing it so much that its 
beyond words.
The University Center Art Gallery 
will be displaying Creatures from 
October 26 through November 13. The 
Gallery is open on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays, and Fridays from 11 am to 
5 pm and on Wednesdays from 11:30 
am to 7 pm. For more information, con
tact Jennifer Lindow, UC Art Gallery 
Manager at x8-8704.
Show stems from Mayurs renewed mission
ByASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
This past Friday evening, 
Mayur presented its annual 
variety show titled A Passage 
through India. The show, 
attended by over 550 people, 
was well-received and helped to 
further Mayurs new mission of 
spreading South Asian culture 
rather than just Indian cul
ture. Recently, The Tartan sat 
down with Siddharth Gejji, a 
senior business major and one 
of five Mayur officers.
The Tartan: Where did
Mayur come up with the idea 
of the theme A Passage 
Through India?
Siddharth Gejji: Well, last 
year was the first time we had 
a theme. After its success not 
only in terms of participation 
but in terms of audience atten
dance, most of the people in 
the show were key on having a 
theme this year too. In order to 
make the process fair, we 
decide to have elections for the 
theme. So, different ideas were 
proposed and towards the end 
of elections, it seemed that 
most people wanted a theme 
where the diversity of the cul
ture was brought out. 
Eventually that diversity idea 
developed into a train journey. 
We decided to choose four parts 
of India and w!e had to prepare 
our dances, skits, and songs 
according to those regions.
TT\ Were you surprised by 
the large turn-out of people?
SG: Well, I was surprised
last year when for the first 
time we had to put additional 
chairs in Rangos. Generally, 
we had about 400 people before
these events?
SG: I think it is due to the 
growth of Mayur itself and the 
increased awareness of all
ed our vision into things like 
social service, showing Hindi 
movies on campus, and partici
pating in events with other

that and last year we had 
about 525. This year it was 
even more  closer to 
about 560.
TT: What do you think has

ture. Over the past two years, 
not only have we increased the 
number of events but also the 
magnitude of the types of

have focused more on cultural

We entered the Booth competi
tion last year for the first time.
driven . the popularity of things we do. We have expandFor the past two years we have
done a lot of things for the first 
time which has increased 
momentum in terms of interest 
and the show is just part of 
that renewed interest.
TT: What do you think has 
attracted more non-Indians :to 
come to these performances 
and want to experience 
the culture?
SG: I think the educational 
value of our programs has 
attracted the attention of 
many non-Indians. Unlike the 
past when it used to just be a 
bunch of songs and dances 
with a lot of entertainment 
value but no educational 
value, people came but didnt 
really get a lot out of the pro
grams. Since last year when 
we had a theme, I think people 
are able to better understand 
what is happening on stage. 
And because they can relate to 
it better, they can learn some
thing new.
TT: What sort of content in 
the show really makes -it 
appealing to everybody?
SG: I think the show hiajsa 
universal appeal to people who 
want some intellectual value, 
people who want dances, apd 
people who want music. 
Theres every element to it Jr 
drama, dance music  not 
only for those who watch it, 
but also for those who take 
part in it. Its a three-hour per
formance packed together with 
all these different elementp. 
Thats why we have it only 
once a year because it takes so 
much effort to plan.

Thursdays can be breathtaking
UYBHLE,L kF.O PnsR a
at the UC for my colleagues who 
prefer to spend life as close to the 
clusters as possible. First, youll 
need to find a friend to go with, 
because it can get sort of depress
ing seeing all those happy people 
whiling away their Thursday 
nights together, if youre 
all alone.
Next I suggest heading off to 
one of CMUs most incredible 
dining establishments. The 
ever popular O is the desti
nation of CMUs most discern
ing students. On a Thursday 
night, the place is packed with 
a whos who of CMU socialites. 
Presidents of organizations 
and soon-to-be high-flying 
Fortune 500 presidents, and 
cutting-edge software engi
neers are all regulars at the 
O. Recently the O has 
added such dynamic and 
trendy dishes as Atlantic 
salmon, and fresh grilled 
chicken. Though none of these
dishes are complete without 
an order of potatoes prepared 
a la O.
After indulging at the O I 
suggest you head off to the pic
tures  McConomy has the 
greatest sound system in the 
area, and the tickets are only a 
buck. Now, how can you beat 
that? Plus on Thursday night 
you can exercise your cultural 
side by taking in breathtaking 
alternative movies. Last 
Thursday, for example, you 
could have joined 30 or so other 
students in McConomy for a 
showing of David Mamets epic 
masterpiece The Winslow Boy 
which was set in England over 
100 years ago. Such an experi
ence will leave you desiring a 
cup of tea and a scone with 
Devon clotted cream at an 
afternoon outing to Surrey, 
rather than a dried-up espresso 
at Skibo. Youll be ready to jet 
off on the Concorde to 
Nottinghamshire for some fox

hunting with your old 
chum Bartholomew from 
primary school.
Even though most of us cant 
afford a $5,000 ticket to 
London, it is still possible to 
indulge in a little bit of British 
sport with a good mate with
out even leaving the UC. If 
youre confused, let me tell you 
what I have in mind. A simple 
game of squash. No big bouncy 
racquet ball and oversized rac
quet heads. No, my friends, 
this is the game that real men 
and women play. A game which 
requires such dexterity and 
speed, that we lazy Americans 
had to invent racquetball 
because we couldnt handle 
squash. Now I know most of 
you are going to say, Well, I
dont have a squash racquet. 
Let me alleviate your worries. 
Just take your ID to the sports 
desk, and theyll loan you a 
racquet and a ball! Youll be all 
set to work off a little bit of 
that Atlantic salmon.
After youve completed that 
invigorating game of squash, 
youll surely be ready for that cup 
of tea. Youre still 3,600 miles 
away from England, so yes, youll 
have to settle for Skibo, which 
does, however, make a good 
cuppa, as the Brits refer to it. So 
this brings us to about 11 pm, and, 
well, its late. In keeping with the 
whole British thing, I suggest a 
nightcap. Maybe you could spend 
a little time with a Beefeater? 
Youll never look at Thursdays the 
same way again. Cheers!

KAUFMANN'S
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD
Equal Opportunity Employer
Giant should remain one
by Kevin Babbitt
I thought the whole idea behind antitrust laws 
was to encourage innovation and competition for 
consumers benefit. Apparently I was wrong.
The findings of fact from the closely watched 
antitrust case against Microsoft would seem to 
suggest otherwise. In the interest of full disclo
sure, I worked for them last summer and am con
sidering a full-time position there, but my point 
here is neither for nor against Microsoft. Im only 
interested in whats best for consumers. To this 
.end, one fact in particular  number 61  stood 
out as problematic. It reads:
The fact that Microsoft invests heavily in 
research and development does not evidence a 
lack of monopoly power. Indeed, Microsoft has 
incentives to innovate aggressively despite its 
monopoly power. First, if there are innovations 
that will make Intel-compatible PC systems 
attractive to more consumers, and those con
sumers less sensitive to the price of Windows, the 
innovations will translate into increased profits 
for Microsoft. Second, although Microsoft could 
significantly restrict its investment in innovation 
and still not face a viable alternative to Windows 
for several years, it can push the emergence of 
competition even farther into the future by con
tinuing to innovate aggressively. While Microsoft 
may not be able to stave off* all potential para
digm shifts through innovation, it can thwart 
some and delay others by improving its own prod
ucts to the greater satisfaction of consumers. 
Lets deconstruct this particular finding. The 
first three sentences basically boil down to, The 
potential for increased profits is incentive for 
Microsoft to continue innovating. I have no argu
ment with that  substitute any company name 
-for Microsoft and it still holds true.
The rest of it is what bugs me. More or less, the 
latter half of fact number 61 states that Microsoft, 
by continuing to add new features to its software, 
has actually hurt consumers by making it harder 
for other companies to enter the market.
So what is Microsoft supposed to do? Stop all 
development to let other companies catch up? 
That sounds counterproductive to me.
. I could offer more analysis of Judge Thomas 
Jacksons manifesto, both for and against
Microsoft, but I doubt Id sway any opinions. 
Instead, Id like to look at the larger picture: In 
the interest of giving consumers the ultimate win, 
what exactly should the Department of Justice do 
about the Redmond monopoly?
The first option that comes to many peoples 
minds is to break it up. Right. If you think 
Microsoft products are buggy now  or even if 
you dont  wait until their first post-breakup 
releases. Youre in for an unpleasant surprise.
Part of the reason that Office-family applica
tions, for example, are able to work (relatively) 
well with each other and with other Microsoft 
products is that theyre all developed under one 
roof, which facilitates communication among 
developers. Break them apart, and you lose that 
connectivity. Have you ever been on tech support 
with a software company  any software compa
ny  because your document wont print? 
Sometimes they tell you its not their fault, and 
you should call the people who wrote the printer 
driver and the operating system. So you call 
them, and they say its not their fault, and you 
should call the application developer. In other 
words, neither one of them wants your dead cat 
on their side of the fence, and youre out of luck.
Office is not without its healthy share of bugs, 
but at least having the people who wrote the 
application and the people who write printer dri
vers for Windows in the same company facilitates 
a solution on one end or the other. Theres no fence 
to throw the dead cat over  its all one yard.
Another option is to limit the nature of contracts 
Microsoft can enter with PC vendors, also known 
as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or 
Microsofts biggest customers. Proponents of this 
tack argue that the exclusive nature of such con
tracts makes it too hard for other operating sys
tem developers to enter the mainstream market.
If anything needs to be done about Microsoft, I 
think this is it. Disallowing exclusive contracts 
with OEMs would give all OS and browser mak
ers  including Microsoft  a fair chance and 
leave it up to consumers to choose the one they 
prefer. Let Microsofts products stand next to oth
ers without the protection of an exclusive con
tract. If, given the choice, consumers still choose 
Windows and Internet Explorer, then rivals wont 
have an argument anymore.
Wow, what a novel concept  letting consumers 
decide which product is best, instead of letting the 
courts decide for them. After all, consumers are 
the ones that are supposed to come out ahead in 
the end, right?

Students sell tickets to last Thursday's AB movie, David Mamets The Winslow Boy.
Artsy AB movies thrill
i*|a#Lt kF.O PnsR a
like Night of the Living Dead and Tron were 
both past Thursday flicks.
Sundays are generally awful movies that no 
one can see anywhere else. Fridays are 
Hollywood movies that have quality, but also 
commercial appeal. Thursdays have been direct
ed towards everything else, namely foreign, 
classic, independent, and nonmainstream, 
said Gehring.
Overall, I guess my goal with Thursday 
nights is to allow people to see movies that I feel 
are really worth seeing and that they probably 
wouldnt get to see anywhere else, said 
Gehring. The problem with this is that many 
people dont enjoy the movies I show, and there
fore movie turnout is always low. However, I am 
happj' to say that this year had the largest 
Thursday movie turnout ever, with Life Is 
Beautiful, which we have been trying to get for 
the past year and a half.
SDC shows the Saturday night movie, but the 
rest are up to AB film chairs. Traditionally, the 
position of film chair is passed on to whoever is 
interested and the current film chair deems
worthy. Gehring said its usually not a problem, 
since it is rare that there are more people inter
ested than seats. These chairs do ail of the pick
ing and ordering of movies that are shown. They 
are ordered from large film distributors like 
Swank or New Yorker Films.
After the films come in from the distributor 
they need to be assembled. Most of the work is 
done by Gehring himself and one other helper; 
the ticket takers are hired. Each movies comes 
in five to seven reels; after assembly, the contin; 
uous piece of film is about two and 3/4 miles 
long and are run on 35mm or 16mm projectors 
in the UC. Before Gehring became a chair, he 
used to help set up on Sundays and work with 
the last Thursday film chair.
I think the films are a break from big 
Hollywood films, they open your eyes to a differ
ent culture, said Anupriya Grover, a first-yea^ 
student in H&SS. Many come off as more real*: 
istic, they give viewers a chance to connect with 
the characters.
Dave Lean, a sophomore mechanical engi
neering major, said, The Thursday night film 
are a way to broaden cultural horizons.

Eureka! I've just proven that 
all maps can be colored with 
only two colors.
That's ridiculous. * No, that' 
preposterous. No, ludicrous. 
But let's hear it anyway.
Well, let's say that one color is yellow, and the other blue. Then you can mix those two colors together to create green or leave a country uncolored to make it white.
The rest follows from the fourcolor theorem. *
So what do you think?
Actual crank-submitted proof!

The Harder They Are The Farder They Chew
Die Bart Die (Allusion to the AlMighty Simpsons)
by: James Kenney zROndl6 'PbReeRwnegFRm5hOG5RgG2
I was so angry I could barely think. I 
read the magazine any ways. The article 
was concerning dead presidents. I wasn't 
concerned. On the next page was a 
photo of the human rope, twisted into 
a rather painful looking pose. He made 
a living because he was flexible.
It reminded me of a gumby toy I had, 
which was essentially poorly molded and 
painted rubber that had a thick yet 
malleable wire skeletal system. I was 
sitting in German class half asleep these 
past 2 days dreaming of dead presidents. 
Dreams so vivid I drooled on my desk.
Sure in middle school kids would laugh 
with you if you farted, and laugh at 
you if you drooled on your desk, but 
when you drool on your desk in college 
people lose respect for you and brand 
you as unintelligent. This might not seem 
to matter, unless you run for president.
THi HT
Every vote counts, 30 kids in my German 
class, 30 less votes. I was elected as the 
first president to ever dress as gumby. 
Things went picture perfect until that 
fateful day I was shot point blank, "Die" 
the assassin shouted. He had a slight 
German accent, my dead lip drooling.

BODY
Ancient art form becomes new fashion
By ELIZABETH DODSON
Tartan Staffwriter
The practice of body piercing is one 
that reaches as far back into ancient 
History as primitive drawings. The 
worlds oldest mummified man, discov
ered in an Austrian glacier and deter
mined to be over 5,000 years old, had his 
ears pierced and the holes stretched to 
hold discs or plugs 711mm in diameter. 
Surprisingly, piercing has endured the 
test of many a millenium, and continues 
to be popular in modern society.
The septum piercing, which goes 
through the layer of skin in the nose 
between the outside cartilage and the 
cartilage separating the nostril, is an
other ancient practice. According to a 
report by Cheyenne Morrison of One 
Tribe, a body art company in Australia, 
The piercing of the septum is probably 
the second most common piercing among 
primitive peoples after ear piercing. 
Septum piercing was prevalent in war
rior cultures from the Asmat tribe of 
Irian Jaya, a province in Eastern Indo
nesia, to the Aztecs and Mayans of 
Mexico, the Incas of Peru, and the Nez 
Perc tribe in Washington state. In fact, 
the name Nez Perc is French for nose 
pierced. Despite its ancient roots, how
ever, body piercing is anything but an
cient history.
One look around Carnegie Mellon re
veals just how popular piercing is today. 
For some, piercing is done purely for 
aesthetics. For others, the practice of 
piercing has, a much deeper meaning.
While the possibilities for piercing 
seem almost endless, ear piercing seems 
to be the first step for many piercees,
perhaps because there are around 14 
different types of ear piercings alone.
ends, however. The next year, influ
enced by friends who had had the proceforms of piercing, neither is anything 
new. Nipple piercing experienced a surge
This fact seems to be especially true for dure, Gustavsen had one of her nipples of popularity nearly 700 years ago in the

mothers to have their ears pierced at 
such a young age that they hardly re
member the experience. For junior busi
ness administration major Colette 
Bourne, the next step after the typical 
lobe piercing was a helix (upper ear) 
cartilage piercing, and a tongue pierc
ing as well. Many people unfamiliar I 
with piercing cringe at the mere men
tion of this last piercing, but the truth 
is that it is actually one of the least 
painful, least infection-prone piercings 
a person can get. The lack of pain is due 
to the fact that the tongue is a muscle 
with striations that allow the needle to 
pass through easily, and the lack of 
infections is due to the mouths natural 
bacteria-fighting enzymes. According 
to Bourne, the worst aspect of this 
piercing is the fact that the protruded 
tongue has to be gripped with forceps 
during the process. Saliva, anyone?
Emily Gustavsen, a senior design 
major, has taken her piercings a little 
further. Like Bourne, Gustavsens first 
experience with piercing was when she 
got her ears pierced as a young girl. 
Then, as a junior in high school, 
Gustavsen stole her older sisters ID in | 
order to get her belly button pierced.
It was a really seedy place on the 
South Side of Philly, Gustavsen said. 
The guy pierces it with the stud gun 
then gives me a ring and tells me to put 
it in in four days. I was really lucky there 
was no infection. When I think back, I 
think, That was so stupid.
This is not where her piercing story

Yes, during the healing period they can 
be sensitive and painful, but apparently

in Pittsburgh.
She is not alone in her choice. For
merly taboo piercings like these, as well 
as genital piercing, are becoming in
creasingly mainstream, though like most
14th-century courts of Queen Isabella of 
Bavaria, and another in the 1890s in 
Paris. In every era, including ours, rea
sons for the piercing have been both 
aesthetic and sensual.
Tim Girone, owner and operator of 
Hot Rod Body Piercing Co. in the South 
Side, has been interested in 
body art all of his life. Even 
as a little kid, I was always 
5 sticking pins in something, 
5 he said.
^ It may be surprising to 
know that to become certi~ fied in body piercing, one
o only needs to complete 30- 
ro 35 hours of training. Girone 
t? believes, and most people 
 would agree, that this short 
0 training period is not nearly Jj enough to qualify one as a 
S reliable operator. Piercing, 
tj after all, is a minor surgical 
? procedure.
ir Piercing is a form of art,
o Girone said. There is a lot 
if to it.
 In order to become a qualo ity piercing artist, Girone 
went through a lengthy apro prenticeship. He has now 
been operating on his own 
for nine years, and believes 
that the apprenticeship form of training 
is definitely the most effective. His em
ployees go through training similar to 
the kind he had, in which they first learn 
the managerial aspects of the business, 
taking care of the desk, answering the
phones, as well as what jewelry is appro
priate for which piercing and what the 
aftercare procedure for each different 
piercing entails. They then move to peri
ods in which they observe procedures, 
assist in procedures, and finally per
form supervised procedures. The whole 
process can take anywhere from six to 
18 months.
Mica Hall, a current apprentice at Hot 
Rod, said, Make sure you look at the 
artists portfolio. He also pointed out 
that there should be a clearly sterile, 
separate area in which the piercing is 
performed and an autoclave, a sort of 
sterilization oven, on site. In addition, 
the piercing artist himself should be 
clean and confident in his skills.
With all these things to consider, some 
may wonder why anyone would decide 
to go through with a piercing in the first 
place. The reasons, as mentioned before, 
vary from person to person.
Gustavsen said, Its fun! Its not all 
bad and painful.
Bournes answer was, It goes with 
being young.
Chris DeWan. a sophomore computer 
science major who has had 11 piercings 
total, is one person who can truly be 
called a devoted piercing follower. His 
reasons for piercing go beyond fashion, 
and even beyond just having fun.
I like the way it feels in my face. I like 
the way my head clinks when I shake it
 I like feeling of my ears wobbling 
when I walk, said DeWan. I like the 
fact the I stand out in crowds, that five 
times as many people know my name as 
I know theirs. I like bright shiny things.
I like the way metal accents and lights 
up a persons face.Permanent art becomes 
fixture in modern society
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Diversions Editor
Who would have thought that 
tattooing, an earmark of a subculture spawned in the 20th cen
tury, can actually be traced back 
to our Neanderthal, knuckledragging ancestors? Yep  that 
big ornate depiction of a buxom 
calendar girl that you saw 
sprawled out on the bicep of that 
leather-clad ZZ 
Top look-alike at 
Eat N Park has 
its roots in a time 
devoid of rock n 
roll and Harley 
Davidsons. De
spite the passing 
of many a cen
tury, tattooing 
remains a popu
lar means of selfexpression the 
world over.
Tattoos are 
like permanent 
jewelry, said 
Shane Miner, a 
junior film and 
computer anima
tion major who has tattoos on his 
thumb and neck. Some people 
have thumb rings that they wear 
on a daily basis. Mine just doesnt 
come off, he said.
Such permanent jewelry has 
been around for ages. Dating as 
far back as the Iceman of 3300 
BC, tattoos have been a standard 
form of decoration serving a vari
ety of purposes, from marking 
slaves to providing magical proJosh Ganderson, junior design

tection.. Tattoos commonly 
marked the face, especially in 
Native American tribes. The tat
too was usually created through 
a process of simple pricking. But 
when some California tribes in
troduced color into the scratches, 
the.closest ancestor to the mod
em tattoo was born.
Considering the long history 
tattooing has in human culture, it 
is then somewhat surprising that 
the rise of tattoo
ing in the 20th 
century has 
earned itself 
rather negative 
stereotypes. Hav
ing a tattoo does 
not necessarily 
imply that the 
bearer also has a 
nagging drug ad
diction or an af
finity for bar 
brawls. That be
ing said, some feel 
that society is be
coming a little 
more accepting of 
this type of body 
art.
Society is definitely changing, 
said Ed Parker, a sophomore ar
chitecture major. In large cities, 
everyones covered. By the time 
were older, everyones going to 
have a tattoo. As it is, older people 
have been fairly receptive [of my 
tattoos].
Parker has three tattoos  a 
tree on his hip, a cross on his 
back, and the word love on his 
right armpit. Each tattoo has a
separate significance to him, and 
are more than mere drawings.
Theyre all kind of markers in 
time for me, Parker said.
However, to many, tattoos are 
still a rather extreme form of self 
expression. They can be ex
tremely painful, expensive (some 
can range anywhere from $50 to 
$150), and, of course, permanent. 
But to the tattoo enthusiast, all 
of that really doesnt matter.
Some people are pretty dumb, 
asking me if [the tattoos] are real, 
or if I know theyre permanent. 
Like, shit, they forgot to tell me 
that part, said Jon Kolko, a se
nior design major with four tat
toos on his arms, leg, and back.
It hurts most near the bones, 
said Parker, who added that his 
back hurt the most of his three 
tattoos. The back isnt too sensi
tive with the way the nerves are 
spaced, but near the spine it hurts 
more, he said.
Nevertheless, many find tat
toos well worth the pain. Ask 
anyone with a tattoo if he or she 
will likely get another, and theyll 
most likey say yes.
Theyre addictive, Miner said. 
My friend and I had to make a 
deal not to get anymore for a 
while.
So, would we as a society have 
delved so deeply into the world 
of tattoos were it not for our dear 
friend the caveman? Its hard to 
say. But considering the history 
tattooing has in human culture, 
it is likely that tattoos will be 
just as permanent in society as 
the ink used to make them.
Parlors offer experience 
to Pittsburgh piercers
By CAM CREWS
Tartan Assistant Diversions Ed.
While the permanency of hav
ing ink etched into the skin may 
be off-putting to some, for tattooists and their patrons, this 
very feature is part of the draw 
to the art form. Tattoos have 
become an integral part of Ameri
can culture, and tattoo parlors 
have been enjoying the returns 
here in Pittsburgh. Currently, 
18 tattoo parlors are in business 
within Pittsburgh with several 
on the fringes of local 
college campuses.
Hellion House Body Piercing 
and Iron City Ink, located above 
a bar on North Craig Street, 
prides itself in the experience1 of 
its staff and notoriety within the 
field. They have been in opera
tion for over seven years, and 
have the distinction of being the 
second oldest piercing and tat
too parlor in business in Pitts
burgh. The healthy competition 
amongst Pittsburgh tattoo par
lors mandates reasonable rates 
and prices. At Iron City Ink, 
prices start at $40, although the 
final amount is largely depen
dent upon the size, location, and 
intricacy of the design.
Established businesses such 
as Iron City Ink have little money 
to spend on advertisements and 
depend largely on positive word 
of mouth through customers. 
Autumn, a tattooist at Iron City 
Ink and a CMU alumna, siaid 
that whatever money is saved 
from advertising costs is passed
on to the customer. Return cus
tomers never pay full price, 
she said.
Safety is a primary precaution 
of tattoo parlors, and medical 
waivers must be signed prior to 
the procedure for legal reasons. 
Gary, a tattooist at Iron City Ink, 
emphasized the value of having 
skilled artists perform the proce
dure. He notes that a good tattoo
ist has an artistic background 
and avoids becoming a human 
copy machine by ensuring that 
each tattoo is a unique design.
Shannon Lynch/Tartan Photo Staff 
Pittsburgh offers many options for those 
in search of bodily expression.
Gary himself said he has per
formed over 12,000 tattoos over 
the course of ten years.

Avenue on Meyran Avenue on 
the 13th of September and is on meet the request.
the fringe of the University of 
Pittsburghs campus. One of the 
two tattooists working at the par
lor, Z, said the majority of her 
clients are between the ages of 18 
and 30. As the name of her estab
lishment might imply, she does 
not believe tattoos to be pai fui. Z 
describes the feeling as only an 
irritation and believes tattoos are 
completely safe as long as they 
are performed responsibly.
The consensus among tattoo
ists indicates that the upper arm 
is the most common part of the 
male anatomy to be tat
tooed, while for women, the 
small of the back has be
come the popular location 
for tattoos. Popular styles 
of tattoos are a less clearly 
defined issue. Tattooists be
lieve that each tattoo rep
resents the individual 
choice of the customer, and 
as such there is no single 
favorite type of tattoo. 
However, skulls, roses, and 
banners are common, along 
with Greek letter tattoos, 
which are popular amongst 
members of the college 
population.
Literature from Iron City 
Ink states a tattoo is a life
time investment, and a tat
too will in fact be with you 
for the rest of your life. 
For those that do decide to make 
a commitment and get themselves

LIOq a|aUMR UnFvne J rnFeRsdR iRll.e BedCRFNdvw J f I.CROARF /uuuFilm-esque play creates whimsical charmi
By JENNIFER J. PETRINI
Tartan Staffwriter
Theres a new movie house in town, 
and its showing one of those old films of 
the 1940s. The Hudsucker Proxy is play
ing at the Stephen Foster Theatre at the 
University of Pittsburgh, and its the 
best new film re-creation ever put to 
the stage.
Although filmmakers Joel and Ethan 
Coen and Sam Raimi get the credit for 
the story, the applause is awarded to 
director Robert C.T. Steele and Kellee 
Van Aken for developing this comedyfilled screenplay for the Pittsburgh stage.
; In a world premiere performance, the 
workplace comes alive as the plays stars 
are introduced. The play opens with the 
whimsical charm of Moses, our narra
tor, who plays just about every scene as 
a different persona. He is really the 
clockworker for Hudsuckers company 
but also appears as a lip syncher of 
oldies tunes, a friend to the newsboy, 
and the fighter of evil forces. Basically, 
'hes the godly figure who ties the 
story-together.
He also introduces the main plot  
President Waring Hudsucker cant take
 the heat any longer, and in a desperate 
plea to get out, he jumps out of the 
window in his office, falling straight to 
his death. The company, now headed by 
; Sidney J. Mussberger, must find some
way to keep Hudsuckers together. They 
plan to hire a new president, an imbecile 
who will allow them to make more money 
by selling their current stock while his 
choices roll the company into the dirt.
In a mad craze, Norville Barnes from 
the mail room enters the office holding a 
envelope that could break their future 
the feared blue letter. Yet for a minute, 
his ideas run wild and he spontaneously 
shows Mr. Mussberger his idea for the 
children. While his moronic charisma 
sweeps Mussberger into promoting him 
to President, the press doesnt buy it. 
They know something is up with 
Hudsuckers new proxy. In her plan to 
uncover the truth, eager reporter Amy 
Archer becomes Norvilles secretary and 
learns of the underground dirt. Of course, 
heres where the romance lies and the 
plot thickens.
Norville changes the destiny of the 
company by introducing a capitalist prod
uct, the Hula Hoop, which sells millions 
in its first week. Once he becomes popu
lar, his young and delicate mind turns 
hollow, a trait that even Amy cant stand. 
She leaves him, and she also quits re
porting when the press starts printing 
lies about Norville. Yet there is a happy 
ending, the perfect close for a play of 
this nature.
The stunning work of set designer 
Stephanie Miller complemented the per
formance well. A gigantic clock hanging
over the Hiidsuckers office gave the 
play a cartoon-esque feel. This clock 
would periodically rise to reveal the ledge 
of a building and a stage for miscella
neous characters. At center stage was a 
rotating platform 
that composed each 
picture with a 
sense of movment 
and elegant flair.
Designed wit p pale 
blues, greens and 
purples, th set 
easily became an 
office, the nlail 
room, Manhattan 
Argus press rom, 
the clock and gear 
room, Hudsuckers 
caf, and more.
Most interesting 
and creative were 
the transparent 
windows that not 
only outlined char
acter shadows but 
displayed head
lines, word clips, 
still images, and 
off-stage actions.
There couldnt have been a cast with 
more personality. Each actor faithfully 
committed himself to the comic aspects 
of the play to create a startling and 
surefire success. With his Richie
Cunningham appeal, Mark Tavani porhis Moses became the man who watchSS* 
trayed Norville Barnes as a sweet, innothe clocks and saw time pass around the 
cent, ambitious young man in pursuit of world. He became the all-knowing chara better life for himself. His climb up the acter who added quirkiness and delight 
corporate ladder was most sincere and to the cast, shining with ease on stage
and adding a backbone 
to the performance.
Mary. Kate Urbanski 
played Amy, a strong 
one of the guys charac
ter who Was in charge of 
her own success, as was 
the character Sidney'J. 
Mussberger, played by 
Larry John Meyers. 
Both contributed talent 
and concrete develop
ment to the story.
Also notable for the 
humorous anecdotes 
were Amy White as Mrs. 
Mussberger, Bob Grant 
as Buzz, and Mikelle 
Johnson, who gleamed as 
the mail room organizer 
and Dr. Braithwait.
Since the actual movie 
cannot prove to be any 
more entertaining and 
amusing than Pitts repertory theatre,

Ron McClelland had large shoes to fill 
as the narrator of the play. Ultimately,Movie struggles with God
By BALAJI SARPESHKAR
; Tartan Staffwriter
Does God exist? Do angels ever 
get drunk? Was Jesus black? 
These questions are fairly diffi
cult to answer, but writer/direc; tor Kevin Smith gives it his best 
shot in his new film, Dogma. This 
latest effort from the director of 
such masterpieces as Clerks and 
Mallrats takes the audience on a 
quest to discover the answers to 
some of the rmore bizarre - 
mysteries 
~of the uni; verse, yet 
somehow still 
winds up in 
New Jersey.
Even after 
watching the 
first few min
utes of the 
film, you 
know you are
through a loophole in Catholic 
dogma. If the two pass through 
the arches of a certain cathedral 
in New Jersey, their sins will be 
erased, making them once again 
eligible for Paradise. There is a 
small problem with this plan, 
however: If it works, the two will 
eradicate all of human existence.
Enter Bethany Slone (Linda 
Fiorentino). An abortion clinic 
worker who is losing her faith in

!Not Hell, as some might think, 
but a far worse place: Wisconsin.

(Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). 
Meanwhile, an angry demon (Ja
son Lee) will stop at nothing to 
see that Bethany does not suc
ceed in her mission.
One interesting note about 
Dogma is that a large part of it 
was shot in and around Pitts
burgh. For example, the entire
opening scene takes place in an 
arrival terminal at the airport, 
and there is a scene that takes 
place in the very scenic Grand 
Concourse restaurant. While no 
part of the plot actually passes 
through our fair city, it is nice 
to see some familiar locales.
Of course, no Kevin Smith 
movie would be complete with
out the usual round of silliness. 
In this sense, Dogma is no dis
appointment. From the sarcas
tic disclaimer before the movie 
to Gods inexplicable love for 
skeeball, Smith has seemingly 
gone out of his way to ensure 
that the film does not take itself 
too seriously.
However, this movie is not 
another Mallrats. While there 
is plenty of humor, the tone of 
this movie is quite different than 
any of Smiths previous films. 
There is a palpable tension in 
the air that grows as both sides, 
good and evil, struggle tp reach 
; their destination. Its good to
 finally see a movie, however,
, that can deal with the topic of
i religion without getting too
1 heavy-handed.
 And while Dogma probably 
! wont answer all (or any of) your 
j questions about religion, you 
may find yourself rethinking 
j some of your own beliefs as you 
leave. And, anyway, isnt the 
point of a good film to make 
you think?
PSO interprets Mozart
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
Noted for his radical interpre
tations of classical repertoire, 
guest Pianist Stephen Kovacevich 
swept through Heinz Hall last 
Friday evening with his dynamic 
performance of Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozarts Concerto 
Number 24 in C Minor for Piano 
and Orchestra. Furthermore, the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
shone under the direction of guest 
conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste, 
music director of both the Finn
ish Radio Symphony and the 
Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
Undeniably the highlight of the 
evening was Kovacevichs perfor
mance of Mozarts dark piano 
concerto. Mozarts work, com
posed in 1786 in Vienna, is cer
tainly devoid throughout most of 
the piece of any feeling of the 
great jubilation that Mozart must 
have felt during this period  a 
time that saw the premiere of his 
brilliant The Impresario, and his 
wonderful comic opera The Mar
riage of Figaro.
Undeniably, Mozart is one of 
the few composers whose works 
exude a sense of perfection that 
must have haunted the composer 
throughout his short life. While 
Kovacevich and Saraste did not 
introduce any radically new in
terpretations, the brilliance of the 
performance was underscored by
Sarastes heartfelt interpretation 
and Kovacevichs glittery 
playing style.
Saraste did a remarkable job of 
infusing the piece with myriad 
dynamics shifts, and the PSO fol
lowed his lead with precision. The 
first movement provided
I"t5
courtesy Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
Stephen Kovacevich performed Mozarts 
Concerto Number 24 in C Minor in last 
weeks PSO concert.
Kovacevich the opportunity to 
show a full range of expression, 
from the lively finger-work early 
in the movement to the hushed 
interaction with the orchestra in 
the last sections of the work. 
Kovacevich continued his force
ful performance throughout the
much gloomier second and 
third movements.
The other two performances of 
the evening seemed to make less 
of an impression on the audience, 
but still had notable facets. As an 
overture, the PSO performed 
Finnish composer Magnus 
Lindbergs Feria, which 
was composed from 1995 to 
1997. First performed un
der the direction of Saraste 
at Londons Royal Albert 
Hall, Feria was also dedi
cated to the conductor. 
While the piece lacked the 
continuity and - organiza
tion that some look for~iTT 
works of classical music, 
the PSO definitely had its 
moments. Throughout the 
evening it was hard to deny 
that the brass and wind 
sections were in top form 
they played with consis
tent clarity that was espe
cially apparent in their per
formance of Feria.
The evening concluded 
with a performance of 
Sibeliuss Legends. Again, 
the PSO played the piece 
well, and provided the audience 
with a solid 45 minutes of enjoy
able music.

Patricia Prattus Jennings.New photography exhibit portrays pop artist as realist
By DOUGLAS A. JONES, JR
 Tartan Staffwriter
 If you were walking past Sandusky
 Street last Friday night and you saw a
 bunch of floating heads, that was due to
 the innumerable amount of black turtlenecks worn by those on hand to attend
 the opening at the Andy Warhol museum. The museum is hosting a massive 
photography exhibit, with an emphasis
 on contemporary photography and its 
derivatives. Andy Warhol was the pio
neer of this movement, so it is indeed
 appropriate to emphasize this realm of 
! the visual arts.
Warhol, who was a graduate of Carn! egie Institute of Technology, is the su
preme example of the artist as realist. 
Although there are many people who
 ! decry his work for its lack of artistry,
 ! his art is revealing. Ralph Ellison said 
. that the job of the plastic artist is not 
! one of telling at all, but of revealing 
! that which has been concealed by time,
! by custom, and by our trained incapac! ity to tell the truth. The truth at the 
itime of Warhol was revolution
 ! and change.
It is change that attracts Warhol. He 
! turned from conventional methodology 
and started a movement called Pop! Art, which drew its inspiration from
 ; commercialism and industry.
; One example of this in Warhols work is
his fascination with photobooth strips. 
At the museum, you can see what Warhol 
did with these pictures. Warhol said 
that he felt that he was very much a 
part of my times, my culture, as much a 
part of it as rockets and television. 
The museum not only pays homage to 
Warhol, but other photographers as well. 
One photographer the museum exhibits 
is Nadar. Nadar (1820-191,0) was a 
French photographer who is considered 
one the founding fathers of photographic 
art. He was not only a photographer, but 
a painter, novelist, balloonist, and po
litical activist, among other jDi[ofessions. 
Nadar was the first photographer to 
master the self-portrait (ultimately in
fluencing Warhol). He wouldphotograph 
himself in different positions and cos
tumes. However, he also photographed 
famous French personalities of the time. 
Many of this type of pictures are on 
display at the Warhol Museum in a 
section called Nadar/Warhol: Paris/New 
York. This particular exhibit was most 
fascinating because it showed an evolu
tion of photography, from Victorian Paris 
to modern-day New York. It shows how 
Warhol and Nadar were essentially at
tracted to people who drew some sort of 
controversy. For example, Nadars pho
tograph of George Sand and Warhols 
photograph of Grace Jones: both of these 
women had a certain type of tension in 
their lives: Jones for her wild sexual
escapades and Sand for her dressing 
like a man and smoking a cigar while in 
public (surely controversial during Vic
torian France). This part of the museum 
affirmed the axiom that 
the more things 
change, the more they 
stay the same.
Right around the cor
ner from this display 
were perhaps the most 
famous Warhol works.
This exhibit was called 
Stars and Disasters.
Here, the curator fo
cused on Warhols por
trayal of famous celeb
rities and tragedies of 
their era. The first piece 
you see once you walk 
into the room is possi
bly Warhols most fa
mous work: Marilyn 
Monroe, 10 silkscreens 
on paper. In addition to 
Monroe, this exhibit 
contained Warhols de
piction of Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis, Elvis 
Presley, and transposed photographs of Fans of p0p-art 
accidents and newspa
per clippings (Warhol would take the 
actual photos and superimpose them 
with paint onto either canvas or paper).
The reason why this exhibit is coherent Warhol Museum is now open to the 
is because each one the celebrities had public and student discounts are availtheir lives affected by some sort of disasable. Whether or not you are a fan of 
ter; the concept of the exhibit was espephotography or pop art, you will enjoy

An Ideal Husband
Thursday, November 11
Lord Arthur Goring! Lady Gertrude Chiltern! 
Baron Arnheim! And the writer is named Oscar? 
Oh no. This movie sounds like a British comedy. It 
is unlikely that the same people who spontane
ously yell Holy Grail quotes at their cluster 
machine will start uttering An Ideal Husband 
lines instead. However, this movie is still 
bloody interesting.
Perhaps the most interesting thing is that 
Julianne Moore is in this movie and she doesnt 
play the role of the whore like she always does. 
However, she plays a distant cousin to the whore. 
Shes like Linda Tripp in this movie, only much 
better looking. She plays a widow in the 1890s in 
^'England whose deceased husband made a scan
dalous deal" with a well-to-do businessman over 
4he Suez Canal. Now she wants to protect her own 
investments and threatens to tell everyone about 
the deal.

The coolest thing about this movie is not that its 
a really smart take on the Watergate scandal, 
where two teenage girls become walkers for Presi
dent Nixons dog after detracting from a White 
House tour. The absolute best thing is that this 
movie contains actors and actresses from some of 
the best television comedies.
Oh sure, the movie headlines Kirsten Dunst, the 
only teenage movie actress who can actually act. 
(Jennifer Love Hewitt, are you listening?) But it 
also includes actors from Saturday Night Live, 
The Simpsons (Harry Shearer, who does the voice 
of pretty much every non-Simpson), and finally,

Motivated by the success of Snoop Doggy Dogg, 
I wrote a rap when I was 13 called A Homeboy 
and His Dawg. By an amazing coincidence, this 
movie  which I had not seen nor heard of at the 
time  has the same story line. Here goes:
There once was a homeboy with a telepathic 
i dawg/ who lived in post-apocalyptic nuclear smog.
' They pimped around the hood, as it was their 
duty/ to look for some digs and lots and lots of 
; booty.
Until one day they uncovered a hole,/ but not the 
kind dug up by a mole.
They went down inside and found a nation/ 
preserving the times before nuclear proliferation.
One of their leaders daughters approaches the 
homeboy one day./ (The homeboy is played by Don 
Johnson, by the way.)
She said, We cant reproduce cause weve been 
underground for so long./ The homeboy said, I 
can help you using my dong!

Rage Against the Machine 
The Battle of Los Angeles 
Sony/Epic Records
lining
Its been over three years since 
Rage Against the Machines last 
record was released, and 
frontman Zack de la Rocha cer
tainly has a lot to talk about. 
From Mumia Abu-Jamals im
prisonment to the ongoing tur
moil in Mexico, the voice of 
Americas angriest band has 
plenty to rail about, as he does for 
the entire length of Rages third 
album, The Battle of Los Angeles. 
Thankfully, de la Rochas tirades 
are supported by Rages unparal
leled rock assault, which on this 
last effort easily outpaces the 
bands previous recordings.
Rage Against the Machine may 
have popularized rap-metal with 
its 1992 debut, but on The Battle 
of Los Angeles they define it. 
Rather than laboring to force the 
two genres together, Rage strives 
for an all-out rock sound which 
takes on hip-hop sensibilities 
thanks to de la Rochas MCing 
and the bands hard-hitting 
rhythm section. The real star, 
though, is guitarist Tom Morello, 
who produces a stunning array of 
sounds and riffs throughout the 
record. Over the course of The 
Battle of Los Angeles, Morello 
transforms his instrument into a 
harmonica, a synthesizer, and a
turntable, all within the context 
of some of the most head-bobbing 
rock the band has recorded.
Stylistically, Rage Against the 
Machines music doesnt differ 
much from song to song  its 
hard to conceive of de la Rocha as 
a balladeer or the rest of the group 
as folk-rockers. Certainly,
though, this doesnt detract from 
the. bands power. Whether on 
straight rockers like Sleep Now 
in the Fire or the grunge-y first 
single Guerilla Radio, Rage 
maintains an impressive inten
sity level.
Rage Against the Machine may 
not win too many political con
verts with the leftist, revolution 
now messages central to essen
tially every track. Its doubtful 
that many of Rages fans have a 
clue who Leonard Peltier is, and 
The Battle of Los Angeles prob
ably wont incite too many to take 
action. Yet Rages idealistic spirit 
adds a real sense of urgency to
the bands already powerful mu
sical statements. Where bands 
like Limp Bizkit and Korn 
struggle with unfaithful women 
and bad childhood memories, 
Rage Against the Machines mu
sic is filled with actual purpose. 
Couple that with Rages innova
tive sound, and youve got a recipe 
for revolution  or at least a 
great rock record.

The Spinatras
@Midnight. com
CMC International Records
The Spinatras look may de
ceive a new listener. This four 
man band has got all the mak
ings of a popular 80s rock group, 
from the long shaggy haircuts 
and rugged clothing style down 
to crowd-thrilling guitar solos.
Despite their old-school appear
ance, this middle-aged band at
tempts to appeal to the younger 
generation of music lovers as well 
as the long-lived hard rock fans. 
With their new album 
@Midnight. com they display their 
support of and participation in 
the computer age. However, their 
sound does not suffer from any 
generic qualities of a synthetic 
sound. Instead, they combine in
tricate guitar pieces with playful
lyrics and an upbeat tempo. Their 
voices are a little rough, but clear 
and audible, working well with 
the lyrics and style of music. J 
Songs like Kansas and My! 
Back Pages reflect the alterna-! 
tive style popular among many of 1 
todays music lovers, while oth-!! 
ers like Anti-Depressant and,! 
Midnight.com stay true to the! 
hard rock foundations of their;! 
youths. This band even proudly ! 
displays their favor for well-;! 
known actress Michelle Pfeiffer;! 
also someone whose career h.asj! 
lasted and changed with time.;! 
Perhaps a line from their song! 
My Back Pages best describes!! 
this group. I was so much older! 
then, Im younger than that now.,
This album is an interesting 
selection for anyone who enjoys 
rock or alternative music. It may, 
not top the Billboard charts, but;; 
its worth listening to atj 
least once.

As your birthday approaches, Yours Truly

I truly intended, to buy you a gift, but 
things didnt work out. You see, last week 
I found myself in the thick of things at the 
estate auction of the late Ms. Monroe at 
Christies auction house. I got into a bid

Needless to say, my bidding money went

Hey Gemmy, where my girlz at? Im not 
talking about my homies, but my long-lost twin 
daughters. You might have seen them on TVs 
Full House, dually portraying the precocious 
Michelle Tanner, daughter of the questionably
hetero Danny Tanner. I was only in my 60s 
when I gave them up for adoption. You see,!
I was too young to care for them, and wanted 
better for them. Take a cue from Momo, old 
condoms coupled with baby oil,is a recipe for!
... twins! Use that as you wish. I love it! !
Cancer
(June 22-July 22)
Forgive me if. I seem a little lightheaded! 
right now. Crabby. After my binge last week, 
I couldntfit into my favorite,lucky trousers.!! 
In order to.lo^e a few, Ive been on the Ally!! 
McBeal celebrity diet. I had a pixie stick and 
a packet of non-dairy creamer for lunch and ! 
I licked the condensation off of someones! 
Diet Coke can. It was decadent! I love it!
Leo
(July 23-August 22)
You know why I like you, Leo? Because, like 
Jennifer Love Hewitt, you, my friend, are a! 
triple threat.. You have a tremendous capac-!! 
ity for love, Levis that fit like a glove, and a ! 
body straight from heaven abovel I love it!
Virgo
(August-September 22)
This is Greg from the movie column here. ! 
As a Virgo myself, I would like to formally! 
change the name of this zodiac sign. You see, ! 
Momo asked to write about American Pie , 
and offered a little piece of her owii deep-dish 
as compensation. After some warm StarbuckJ ! 
I cant honestly continue to be affiliated with. 
a group named after Virgo the Virgin. Momos ; 
astrological lovin has transcended me past 
this zodiac pigeonhole.
Libra
(September 23-October 23)
Lee-bra, you have something special, and 
its time you start sharing it with others; 
Im not talking about your personality or 
sense of humor, because, frankly, youre 
lacking in those areas. What l am referring 
to, however j is your jumbo-sized bag p? 
Storck Chocolate Riesens. Theyre 
wnderbrl I love it!

PIGS ARE US
So we're currently right in the middle of football season. You can't turn on the 
TV or pick up the paper without hearing about assorted filthy rich young 
men and their pigskin prowess. Which is all very well. But make sure you 
don't forgot about those noble animals who gave their lives and skins so that 
men in shoulder pads and tight pants could tackle each other. That's 
right  if it weren't for pigs, there could be no football. Yet that's 
only the beginning of what pigs have done for humanity. Pigs are 
willing to give their insulin to diabetics, their internal organs to 
people who need transplants, and their love to anyone who 
asks. They can run a mile in under eight minutes. Miss Piggy, 
Babe, and that one pig from South Park who bred with that ele
phant provide heartwarming entertainment for all. They're adorable. 
They're altruistic. They're smart. Scientists have even trained pigs to play video 
games using special hoof-friendly joysticks. Granted, the ability to play Street 
Fighter and Super Mario Kart may not be the most overwhelming sign of intelliArt Lecture Series will continue on Sat
urday at 1:30 pm in the Carnegie Lec
ture Hall. Kerry James Marshall, a 
painter from Chicago, will be speaking.
