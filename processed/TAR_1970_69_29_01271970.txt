Effects of Lottery Explained to 50 People
LARRY CLARK
Fewer than fifty persons gath
ered in the Skibo Ballroom 
Thursday morning to hear Lt. 
Colonel Joseph E. Lindsay des
cribe the effects of the lottery 
on the draft system. Colonel 
Lindsay, a staff member of the 
Pennsylvania Headquarters of 
the Selective Service System, 
began with a review of inscrip
tion through history. From Mos
es through the Massachusetts 
colony and the Civil War to the 
present. Col. Lindsay describ
ed the successes and the failings
of attempted draft systems. 
The system employed by Haile 
Selassi during the Ethiopian 
conflict was termed "simple" 
by Col. Lindsay. A proclama
tion declared that all male citi
zens old enough to carry a 
spear should report for duty. 
If married, he was to bring his 
wife to perform noncombat du
ties such as preparing food. If 
unmarried he was to bring an 
unmarried woman. Women with 
small children were exempted 
from service as were men in
capable of walking or carrying
Student Paper at WSU 
Requests an Investigation
The student newspaper, the 
Racquet, at Wisconsin State 
UniversityLa Crosse (WSUL) has requested that the Unit
ed States Student Press Associa
tion (USSPA) initiate an un
biased investigation of the cir
cumstances surrounding the 
placement of the paper under 
the control of the Mass Com
munications Department.
University President Sam 
Gates ordered the paper, 
as well as the yearbook, given 
to the department after the 
newspaper reprinted Gerald 
Farbers "Student As Nigger." 
He based his action on a recom
mendation by the publications 
board that a study be conducted 
to consider the advisibility and 
implications of such a change in 
the status of the student publi
cations. Gates announced that 
his discussions with fellow ad
ministrators and members of the 
Mass Communications Depart
ment constituted enough of a 
study.
The paper made its request 
for an unbiased study in a tele
gram to USSPA. A copy of the 
telegram was sent to Gates. 
Members of thd Racquet staff 
are also in the process of plan
ning to withhold the amount of 
student activities fee. $1.86 per 
student, that would normally go 
to finance the student publica
tions. Racquet editor Janet Bladow maintains that since the 
publications will be published 
by an academic department, 
student activities fees should not 
fund them.
USSPA Executive Director 
Robert Burton said that the as
sociation will call for a threeman panel of professional jour
nalists. one appointed by Gates, 
one by the Racquet, and one by 
USSPA. to conduct an investi
gation. Burton also said that in 
keeping with the principle of 
due process, the paper should 
remain in the hands of the stu
dent editors while the investi
gation is being conducted.
STP Program Expands
During the past vear and a 
half, the YMCA of C-MU has 
been sponsoring a program call
ed Special Teaching Projects. 
This program was designed to 
bring demonstrations in the sci
ences into high schools in the 
Pittsburgh area. C-MU students 
have performed various experi
ments using equipment not 
available in public schools such 
as lasers, strobes, and liquid nit
rogen. These demonstrations 
have been very successful and 
rewarding for the students per
forming them.

a spear. All violaters of the pro
clamation were to be hanged.
Returning to the present sys
tem. Lt. Col. Lindsay noted 
that our draft laws are acts of 
Congress. It is the Selective 
Service System's responsibility 
to see that these laws are en
forced.
The Colonel then listed the 
present deferments. These, he 
stated, are unchanged from the 
act of 1967. These classifica
tions include:
1A Presently fit and eligible 
for induction.
1AO A man objecting to com
bat duty who will be assigned 
to noncombat duty (eg., a med
ic)
1C Presently on active duty (as 
reported on Form 53)
ID Presently in Reserves (as 
reported on Form 44 >
10 Objects to all forms of 
military service
IS Student with unsatisfac
tory progress (this deferment 
applies for one year only. If 
satisfactory progress is not de
monstrated at this time, the stu
dent will be reclassified 1A >
1W Objector now serving (eg., 
in a hospital)
1Y Temporarily unfit for ser
vice for health reasons
2A Occupational deferment
2C Agricultural deferment 
(To receive this it must be pro
ven that the person's farm pro
duces a prescribed minimum of 
goods and that he does in fact 
work on it)
2S Student making satisfac
tory progress (According to the 
1967 act no 2S deferments will 
be accorded graduate students 
except in specialized medical 
fields)
3A Hardship case where the 
inductee or his family would 
suffer (A man with children is 
no longer exempt if he has pre
viously used another defer
ment)
4A Prior service
4D Government job (eg,, a 
judge)
5A Overage
The Colonel stressed the right 
of appeal of every draftee ef
fective for thirty days from date 
of notification.
The present draft system is 
reviewed every four years by 
Congress. The conversion to the 
lottery system changed only the 
method of call. Under the new 
system, the youngest available 
men will be called first as op
posed to calling the oldest (up 
to age 26) eligible men under 
the previous system.
In answer to a question from 
the audience. Lindsay stated 
that the local boards "don't have 
a good idea" how high they will 
have to go in the draft call or
der to fill their quotas. The 
Colonel did. however, pledge 
support to Dean Swank in help
ing students find the present 
situation at their local boards.
The Colonel was asked if the 
2S deferment would continue to 
b issued unless requested to 
be repealed. He replied that the
2S must initially be requested 
but would then be issued contin
ually until the students eligi
bility for the deferment was 
terminated.
In response to this, Thomas 
Kerr remarked that if, as the 
statute stated, the student must 
request the 2S deferment, then 
he should be able to request its 
appeal. Not receiving a satis
factory answer for this, Mr. 
Kerr then asked if it were in
deed possible for a student to 
request the repeal of his 2S, as 
would be legally correct, and if 
he were to make this request 
in December, for example, how 
long would his eligibility last. 
To this the Colonel answered 
that, had the student's number 
been called early the same 
year he would be taken imme
diately upon reclassification. 
Otherwise, his eligibility would 
extend only until the end of the 
calender year.
It should be noted that in an 
Information Bulletin prepared 
by the Pennsylvania Headquar
ters of the SSS and distributed 
by Lt. Col. Lindsay, it is stat
ed that a registrant cannot be 
reclassified 1A "only at his re
questhe must cease to qualify 
for deferment. When inform
ed of this Mr. Kerr pointed out 
seve.al recent instances in 
which decisions by the SSS 
have been overruled by the 
Supreme Court and he felt that 
this passage, too, would be 
challenged.

EditoriaR
It is time for the President of Student Government to 
address not only the student constituency but also faculty 
and administrators as to the state of the university from 
a students view.
In the past two years, Student Senate has taken upon 
itself the responsibility for acting on various concerns, issue 
and policy related, to students. Before last year, Student 
Government was such a farce that in the spring of 1968 a 
movement developed to completely abolish it.
Since then, although many are still unaware of its ac
tions, the Senate has increased its responsibilities and its 
scope. This year, for example, the Senate has total control 
of $82,000 which it budgets and allocates to all student ac
tivities and organizations. Prior to the administrations deci
sion to grant the Senate total control over its funds, Student 
Government had to request money for an activity from the 
administration who possessed the final grant or no-grant 
power. Besides financing various clubs and services such as 
The Tartan and WRCT the Senate voted this year to allocate 
funds for the publication of The Relative Truth.
Student Senate, as evidence by last weeks censure mo
tion, has not shied away from issues raised and debated be
fore it. A motion in support of the Black Construction Coali
tion, urging a shut-down of the construction sites, was also 
passed.
But there are many other important areas in which the 
Senate acts which, though not directly concerned with speci
fic issues, will have long range effects.
Probably the most important of these is the current 
work on disciplinary codes. As reported last week in The 
Tartan, faculty and students have reached an impasse. Al
though both constituencies for the most part feel the need 
of a revision of the present codes, neither side has been will
ing to accept proposals thus far put before the Conference 
Committee. Because of issues inevitably concerning discip
linary procedures which will most likely arise in the spring, 
such as the standstill in achieving equal rights in the con
struction unions, the necessity for developing a workable 
satisfactory code is all the more critical.
Academic matters have not been left untouched by Sen
ate committees. Although the resignation of Michael Armentrout as Director of Academic Affairs has effected the 
Committees progress, the permission to seat students on 
college councils has certainly been a step in the right direc
tion. In addition, students have obtained voting seats on two 
Trustee committees, as well as on many administrative deci
sion-making bodies.
The Activities Board, financed by Student Senate, has 
been importantly influential in changing the tone of stu
dent life. Several years ago, social activities on campus cen
tered around the fraternity system. Although Greek activi
ties still provide a kind of social outlet many desire, anoth
er range of activities, from Marcel Marceau to Senator Thur
mond, from the New York Rock and Roll ensemble to Arthur 
Schlesinger, has been made available. We heartily com
mend Dan Meloro and his committee for their outstanding 
achievement.
These and other concerns deserve extensive comment 
by the President of Student Government. It is important to 
inform the entire community as to what the Senate has done 
and where it wants to go. It is also necessary to inform peo
ple what means of communication and organizations for ac
tion are available so that in the event of future critical is
sues and decisions the campus community will make an ef
fort to exhaust existing chanels before proceeding to uncon
ventional means of dissent.
The duty of the President to address the Senate within 
six weeks of the beginning of second semester is defined in 
the Constitution but has been ignored in recent years. Be
cause of many issues currently before the Senate of concern 
not only to students but also to faculty and administrators, 
we urge a joint meeting of faculty and student senates, open 
to the entire community, to be called as soon as possible dur
ing the Tuesday assembly period.

Newsroom is a new ap
proach to TV news reporting 
started by WQED this fall. It 
brings the live reporter face-toface with the TV audience as he 
tells about his attempts to get 
the news. Recently a member 
of the Newsroom staff told 
about cornering Gen. Hershey 
in his Pittsburgh hotel room 
(no one else knew he was in 
town on a speaking engagement) 
and getting a story on student
reaction to the draft while the 
general was in his bathrobe.
Mr. John Roberts, director of

such as those raised by Spiro

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Strom Thurmond Strikes with Worse Things
Editor. The Tartan:
Though it wasn't a good idea to throw marsh
mallows. we must get it into perspective.
Strom was saying that members of the au
dience were trying to prevent him from speak
ing. They weren't. That wasn't their goal. He 
wasn't silenced, not even once. Members of the 
audience were responding to him. and to things 
that he was saying.
He says he is for freedom of speech, but in
practice he writes laws like the anti-riot'' 
amendment to the Civil Rights Act. which makes 
it illegal to cross state lines to incite a police 
riot. This is the act under which the Chicago 
Conspiracy 8 are being threatened with ten year 
sentences.
Which is worse, a ten year jail sentence, or a 
marshmallow in the mouth? 1

"Im matching wits with some 
of the best minds in the business.
Just being associated with a 
staff that has such an outstanding 
reputation in the world of finance 
is a stimulating challenge, says 
Bob Reilly of Ford Motor Com
panys Finance Staff. Working 
here has been like getting an
other post-graduate degree. 
When Bob joined the company 
in 1964, he set a personal goal of 
making Supervisor in five years. 
He reached that goal in two-anda-half years. In less than five, he 
was named Manager of the War

small company could have given 
me similar opportunities to grow 
and to learn, he emphasizes.
Success stories like this are 
not unusual at Ford Motor Com

youll find opportunities to grow 
and to learn in Financial Man

Led by six quick points by 
Bob Brown. CMU jumped off 
to an early 8-0 lead and were 
never behind. Some of the best 
shooting of the year and a big 
boost in rebounding by Kevin 
Cotter and Bill Abraham gave 
Tech a 21-12 bulge midway 
through the opening period. But 
a few missed defensive assign
ments gave St. Vincent three 
easy buckets and they pulled to 
within 34-30 at halftime.

Tip-Off Today
The Womens' Basketball team 
opens its 1970 season today at 
4:30. Miss Jane Fisk, the coach, 
began practice last Wednes
day in order to prepare the 
team for the tough schedule 
ahead. Having lost only one 
starter from last year's squad, 
the team has bright hopes for 
the future. Along with a solid 
core of experienced players, the 
newcomers are showing much 
promise. From the few practices 
akreadt held, the team is show
ing a well-balanced offense, al
though they need some work on 
rebounding. The defense, is al
most entirely new but this has 
not stopped them from showing 
the poise and ability that is 
needed to win.
Returning from last year are 
seniors Linda Hood and Mary 
Bookwalter. juniors Nancy 
Chandler and Pat Rober. and 
sophomores Shelia Carter and 
Paula Vergith. They are all hop
ing to improve last season's re
cord of 11-2 (the two losses 
coming from Pitt). The home 
games are played in the Wom

as follows:

grabbed 14 rebounds to lead 
both teams in that department.
Last Wednesday Tech travell

Student Mobilization
Plans February Conference
Despite the October and November anti-war demonstrations, the war continues. Very few people have 
confidence in the peace talks. Despite Nixon's token withdrawals. American GIs continue to be slaughtered.
In an effort to revive the peace movement, the Student Mobilization Committee will hold a national 
conference at Case Western Reserve University the weekend of Feb. 13. 14 and 15. Over 1.500 students, GIs, 
and anti-war activists are expected from every part of the country to gather to discuss together where the 
antiwar movement should go. Information may be obtained from the SMC. 2102 Eculid Avenue. Cleveland. 
Ohio 44115.
The massive October and No
vember demonstrations showed 
the tremendous strength of the 
anti-war movement by involving 
over a million Americans in de
manding that Nixon bring all the 
GIs home now. Sessions are being 
scheduled not only to debate pro
posals for future anti-war actions, 
but workshops and panels will be 
held on a wide range to topics, 
from women's liberation and the 
fight against the war. to GI and 
high school organizing, to the in
ternational anti-war movement.
The Student Mobilization Com
mittee to End the War in Vietnam 
is the national organization of all 
high school and college students 
who are united in uncompromis
ing struggle against the war.
The program of the Committee 
is for the immediate and uncondi
tional withdrawal of ALL U.S. 
forces from Vietnam; for an end 
to the draft; against all forms of 
campus complicity with the war; 
self-determination for Vietnam 
and black America; free speech 
for GIs and hiigh school students.
