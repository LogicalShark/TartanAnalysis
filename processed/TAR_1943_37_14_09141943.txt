A.S.T.P. Men! 
Buy Subscriptions
For the A. S. T. P. men who have 
just begun the first term of study 
at Carnegie Tech, and for A. S. T. 
old timers also, dont you think its 
about time an accounting was held 
as to how much Tech Trainees are 
receiving over and above govern
ment requirements or War Depart'i ment interests?
There now exists an atmosphere 
of friendliness around Tech be
tween the soldiers and the civilians. 
It took a little time to get things 
started, but soon the results of the 
fall social calendar and the efforts 
of ACAC will be evident in the form 
of dances, socials, and stag parties 
, for the entire student body, includ
ing coeds, civilians, and servicemen.
The medium by which news and 
happenings of interest are circulat
ed about the campus is THE CAR
NEGIE TARTAN, an eight to 
\ twelve page weekly newspaper pub
lished every Tuesday morning by 
the undergraduate body. THE TAR
TAN is paid for in part by adver
tisements and in part by the Reg
ular Students General Activities 
Fee. The ASTP trainees pay no 
such fee. But it is essential that 
they know what cooks around here 
if they are to benefit at all from the 
social setup. (And from the eyes 
right business on Margaret Morri
son Street several times everyday, 
it seems evident that they want to 
benefit.)
Therefore, the staff of THE TAR
TAN has decided to sell subscrip
tions to the Army at a rate sufficient 
to cover only the cost of printing, 
handling, and distribution. That 
price has been set at $1.00 for the 
entire school yearcovering ap
proximately nine months38 issues, 
i It would be a reflection on our de
sire to cooperate with Carnegie Tech 
if we do not support THE TARTAN.

I Administration Passes 
On Revised Calendar
> Following is the revised calendar 
for regular classes in the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, which is 
effective starting this semester.  It 
will be noticed that Thanksgiving, 
Good Friday, and July 4 will be hol
idays, as well as the regular vaca
tion which comes during Christmas 
and New Year. This arrangement 
is in effect as long as the trimester 
calendar continues.
Civilians on the quarter plan will, 
of course, follow the ASTP calen
dar, since some of the classes at
tended by the two groups are com
mon to both. The ASTP calendar 
eliminates all holidays and vaca
tions except Christmas and New 
Year.

When the janitor at the Carnegie 
Union goes up to the third floor to 
clean Monday morning, he will 
be greeted by a most astonishing 
and, no doubt, joyous sight. Cigar
ette butts, paper scraps, and pencil 
shavings will be most conspicuous 
by their absence. The rooms will 
be strangely clean and orderly

Rushing Season Opens 
Officially In M.M.C.C 
On Thursday, Sept. 16
The annual sorority rushing in 
M. M. C. C. will formally begin on 
Thursday, September 16, following 
a non-rush tea in Whitfield Hall on 
Wednesday, September 15. .
Marie Sunseri, president of In
tersorority Council, will meet the 
M. M. C. C. sophomores, transfers, 
and the six women engineers who 
are studying for a degree in the En
gineering School, at 5:15 P. M. in 
the Assembly Room, 103 of M. M. 
C. C. on Tuesday, September 14, 
1943. At that time she will explain 
rushing rules in complete detail.
There are three local sororities 
which will be rushing at this time 
in Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege: Alpha Theta Sigma, Gamma 
Phi Sgima, and Kappa Phi DeltaMu Alpha Gamma, which includes 
both Arts and M. M. C. C. students, 
will rush Margaret Morrison sopho
mores and Fine Arts freshmen in 
January, the time of the Arts Col
lege rushing.
It is very important that every 
girl who wishes to join a sorority at
tend the non-rush tea, otherwise she 
will not be considered as interested 
in joining a sorority.
A meeting of the entire student 
body will be held in room 101, Gym
nasium, today at 11:00 to organize 
Techs Third War Loan Drive.
Forbes Streets be kept awake far 
into the night by the chattering of 
typewriters, the breaking of coke 
bottles, and particularly by the 
agonized screams of editors. No, 
the TARTAN, THISTLE, TECH
NICAL, and SCOTTIE have moved, 
and now Messieurs Noyes and Rid
dell , and Mesdames Sunseri and 
Harmany wield the whips over their 
staffs in the pattern room of Indus
tries Hall.
Some of the freshman girls had 
no place to stay, so the noble Car
negie publications (through some 
gentle prodding by Mrs. Yon) sac
rificed their sanctum sanctorum for 
the sake of alleviating the housing 
shortage. Now the four publica
tions are sharing a large barn-like 
hall on the second floor of Industries 
Hall, and are displaying admirably 
the good neighbor policy. In one 
corner all the unimportant campus 
news is gathered for the TARTAN 
front page; in a second corner the 
SCOTTIE editors are busy copy
ing jokes from the Harvard LAM
POON; and the other two corners 
are occupied by the now sleeping 
THISTLE and the mad scientists 
who are busy cooking up little gags 
on perpetual motion, superchargers, 
any hypertension for the Tech intel
lectuals meat, the TECHNICAL.
Everything has gone along fine so 
far, but we cant help being a lit
tle apprehensive of possible pitfalls 
in the future. Without the former 
protective walls there is apt to be a 
mingling of the TARTAN aristo
crats with the riffraff from the 
SCOTTIE. THISTLE ,and TECH
NICAL. This could have serious 
repercussions. The TARTAN may 
soon appear with jokes about coy 
young ladies and drunken seniors, 
and what would the gossip column 
look like with articles on the newest 
thing in steam turbines? But thats 
another war-time risk, so just hold 
your hats and breath and watch for 
a TARTAN with something new 
added.

Tech War Bond Drive 
Its First Activity
After remaining dormant all sum
mer the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology War Activities Committee 
sprang into life this fall with,,the 
launching of the Third War Bo mi 
Drive.
Following Dr. Chworowskys res
ignation last spring Professor Vin
cent G. Parisi was selected to re
place him as Co-ordinator and 
Chairman of the Committee. Pro
fessor Parisi then decided to await 
the start of the Fall trimester before 
reorganizing the Committee, since 
only half of the school was active, 
and the faculty members of that 
half had not had their duties set
tled. Thus, it was just this week 
that Professor Parisi announced the 
new Committee members.
As before, the Committee consists 
of two parts: faculty representa
tives and student representatives. 
The following is a list of the Com
mittee members and their positions:

Yes, No More Carnegie Day
The most recent war casualty at 
Carnegie Tech is the elimination of 
another school tradition, Carnegie 
Day, this year. The decision to elim
inate Carnegie Day was made because 
with the relatively small numbsr of 
ivilian students and the large number 
of ASTP trainees it was felt that there 
would not be as much interest shown 
in the exercises as there was in past 
years. Moreover, with students and 
faculty pressed for time, the burdens 
on both would be very great.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1943
CdUonb. Aimoluusi
One night last week as I walked down Maggie Murph street about 
seven oclock, I saw what anyone who walks down Maggie Murph street 
at seven oclock will see, namely, hundreds of khakiand denim-clad bodies 
lolling on the grassy plains in front of the used to be Mens Dorms, play
ing an unsatisfactory game of touch football in the street, and languidly 
tossing the old one, two, whistle, whistle! at any and all femme attire 
swishing by. Such is the only and ultimate fate of the free hours of the 
ASTP men stationed on this campus, said hours being from 11:50 to 1:05 
in the afternoon and 6:15 to 7:30 in the evening. Now Im not one of those 
temperance leaguers who believes that unsupervised play leads youth to 
ruin, but I do think that such free time as these' boys do have could be 
spent to better advantageno, not in the pursuit of knowledge, I said free 
timebut in good, honest-to-goodness, healthy recreation.
Im not an army man myself, Im iust a piece of that swishing femme 
attire mentioned above who would like to see every dog have his day. 
Since I came back to campus this fall, Ive heard nothing but sighs and 
laments from the women on campus. You know, the usual stuff like, 
Gee whiz, thousands of gorgeous men at this school, and no way to meet 
them. No doubt the boys are saying the same about the women on cam
pus, or am I putting too much stock in the feminine Tech pulchritude? 
Regardless, the situation is deserving of some note. I realize the ASTP men 
are here on serious business and not to horse around like a bunch of col
lege boys, but even so, our boys in North Africa who were also on serious 
business, took time off for a little relaxation whenever the ycould. So far 
the relationship between the ASTPs and the girls hasnt gotten beyond the 
side whistle from the drill lines and the embarrassed smile from the 
P-38 on the sidewalk.
There, Mr. Anthony, is our problem, and here is what I hope is a pos
sible solution. What is stopping this campus from providing a canteen to 
alleviate the aforementioned unhappy situation? Canteen, you say, can
teen, whats the matter with the two this city has already established? 
Well, mainly this: Nothing, absolutely nothing is wrong with them, they are 
wonderful institutions performing an excellent service, only one happens 
to be a half hour removed by street car and the other takes fifteen min
utes each way off your Number 18 stampThe latter canteen, may we add, 
is open only Saturday and Sundayon which days a Tech canteen need not 
necessarily function.
Again, you raise your brows and ask, Where will the money to run 
a canteen come from? And again I lower .your eyebrows by magically 
saying that such a canteen will require no money, except enough to pur
chase a ping-pong table, a victrola, a dozen or so card tables, and the lease 
on coke and cigarette machines. No food need be served, as we trust the 
men are well feed. The money to purchase the equipment need not come 
fro mthe administration, I am sure that if the student body was approach
ed in the correct manner, the response would be sufficient to quiet all 
doubts and financial fears. Of course, I realize that many of the mens 
dorms are equipped in a similar manner, but something vital is lacking 
Girls. This last vitality is what an all-school canteen has to offer. Why 
need the boys look elsewhere for wholesome and charming companionship 
when they can get it in their own front yard? As far as manning the can
teen, there would be few girls on campus unwilling to donate their time. 
To better organize the project, it could be placed in the hands of Inter
sorority Council or some other body representing all the womens organ
izations which could act as a managing body. Each group could man or 
woman the canteen one day a week, barring Saturdays and Sundays. Danc
ing, talking, and a nice juicy game of bridge a la Tech could be the answer  
to an ASTPs prayer.
And now for the final and only dubious questionWhere could such 
a canteen be located? Suggestions have been numerous, but it remains 
for the administration to decide. Rec Hall in Maggie Murph is seldom used 
by anyone. Exhibition Hall in Fine Arts has a lovely dance floor. Then, of 
course there is, or was, the Black Cat Lounge which at this very minute 
may be serving as sleeping quarters for Company Z. The main considera
tion, however, is finding out what YOU want to have done about this 
situation. Then it will be easy (well, not too hard) to do something about 
it. We think it is a fine idea; what do you soldiers and you civvies think?

One of the sweetest girls on the 
campus is the president of Margaret 
Morrison Senate, dark-eyed Doro
thy Schadel. of the Household Eco
nomics Department. This Gamma 
Phi Sigma is chairman of the Spec
ial Committee on ACAC, a member 
of the Glee Club, and president of 
the Household Economics Club. Last 
year she was treasurer of Senate 
and of the junior class, and assistant 
treasurer of Womens Guild.
After she graduates in April, she 
wants to manage a school cafeteria 
or an industrial one or have a tea
room somewhere but of the city, but 
near it. Her favorite eating places 
are the Schenley and the Royal 
York; she was student dietician for 
two summers at the Royal York. 
This past summer she had a wonder
ful time being co-dietician at Camp 
Kon-O-Kwee.
Her idea of a perfect place to live 
is a farmand thats just where she 
would live if she were not going to 
college and could do exactly as she 
pleased. She loves campfires and 
open fireplaces and walking in the 
country, also puppies  especially 
collie puppies. As far as clothes are 
concerned, she will take tailored 
ones; when she has time, she makes 
her own. When she has her farm 
and has time to read, she will read 
strange, romantic, adventuresome 
things like Lost Horizon; and she 
will listen to Sunday, Monday, and 
Always, Star Dust, and Deep Pur
ple.
She has a habit of starting col
lections of things and then not do
ing much about it. When she was 
little, she started a stamp collection; 
in high school she took menus from
Dorothy Schadel
every place she ate; now she is con
centrating on stuffed animals. At 
the moment her favorite color is 
Navy blue; it used to be red, which 
she happens to wear very well. She 
likes her men to be able to dance, 
to like to walk, and to carry on good 
conversations.
Her pet concern right now is the 
food situation on the campus; she 
is trying to get the Household Ec 
Club to have some sort of an eat
ing place in Rec Hall, even if its 
just serving something to drink to 
people who bring their own lunches. 
She will probably start a bringyour-own-lunch campaign. She is 
determined to do something about 
the eating problem. Theres one 
thing she hates more than having 
to wait to eatthats waiting to get 
into a shower. To relax after solv
ing Techs wartime problems she 
plays the pianostrictly for herself}

/7 Picnic Zuesut A/oan!
Overloaded Grill Gives Up Ghost, 
Cries Please Dont Eat Here!
By Ernie
As was announced in last weeks 
TARTAN, the Carnegie Grill, due to 
its inability to obtain sufficient help, 
has been forced to shorten its sched
ule to the following hours: break
fast will be served from 7 to 9 a. m.; 
lunch, from 11 a. m. to 2 p. m.; and 
supper from 5 to 8 p. m.
This decision was reached after a 
special meeting of ACAC called by 
request of Dean Warden, who has 
received an urgent appeal from the 
Grill management. The current 
manpower shortage left the restau
rant virtually without workers, and 
it already had to resort to the help 
of the janitors and several students 
to cope with the additional work 
caused by the hundreds of newly 
registered freshmen. Although all 
authorities involved fully realized 
that the new decision would cause 
many sacrifices and inconveniences 
on the part of the student body, it 
was felt that these regulations were 
the only solution to the existing 
bottleneck. Of course, the status 
quo ante will be re-instated as soon 
as the present difficulties are elim
inated, and the management of the 
Grill suggests the following two 
ways to do so.
First, the management directs an
May Beegle Concerts
All persons interested in obtain
ing identification cards so that they 
may receive the student rates for 
tickets to the May Beegle Concerts 
can obtain them at the Music of
fice, 153 Fine Arts. The card is then 
presented at Mellors Box Office, 604 
Wood St.
This seasons program will include 
such artists as Fritz Kreisler, Vladimer Horowitz, and Ezio Pinza.
Lowentein 
urgent appeal to all students 
who possibly can. to bring their 
own lunch to school. This should 
prove very easy for all persons liv
ing at home or in nearby fraternity 
and boarding houses; and these stu
dents are fervently requested to 
comply with the appeal. The short
ened schedule, even with the addi
tional help discussed in the next 
paragraph, makes it absolutely nec
essary to decrease the present num
ber of customers in order to run the 
Grill efficiently. ACAC will try to 
make arrangements for the serving 
of hot and cold drinks elsewhere on 
the campus throughout the day, and 
there is sufficient room indoors and 
outdoors for a comfortable meal.
As an additional measure to al
leviate or even eliminate the present 
situation the management of the 
Grill asks that all students interest
ed in part-time work at the Grill 
register at Dean Murphys officeEven with the shortened schedule 
and the reduced number of cus
tomers the restaurant will still be in 
dire need of help, and will welcome 
any students as paid workers. Only 
if enough students comply with this 
and the preceding request will the 
Grill be reopened on full schedule. 
So, please, all of you who can snare 
a short time every day, get a job at 
the Grill; if possible, bring your 
own lunch; and above all,' do not 
complain.

Mr. B. Iden Payne, authority on 
Shakespeare and former director of 
the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre 
at Stratford on Avon, has announc
ed that Twelfth Night has been se
lected for production. The play was 
done here once before many years 
ago.
Because of the man shortage in 
the Drama Department, the young 
mens parts in the play will be taken 
by girls. Using girls in mens parts 
has already been done, and quite 
successfully, in the University of 
Iowa. Mr. Payne says, It wouldnt 
be done in a modern play, but in pe
riod costumes, especially Elizabeth
an and possibly in the classics of 
Greece and Rome, it would be ac
ceptable. Its like convention; you 
soon settle down and it no longer 
seems strangeWhen Shakespeare 
was played in modern clothes, peo
ple forgot about it after the first few 
minutes of the play.
The opening date and the cast are 
to be announced later.

Brazilian Lass In Design Course Uses 
Good Neighbor Policy On Hollywood
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1943
New Calendar
Copyright Jack Woods, Warner Bros.
Here Edith Bastos, is pictured chatting with Gary Cooper, whom she 
met at a Hollywood Studio and who evidently approves of the good neigh
bor policy.
Estou encantada com o bom 
acolhimento do povo Americano, 
or as Edith Bastos, Techs lassie 
from South of the border puts it in 
her newly acquired English, Amer
ica, eet is swell!
Having wanted to study dress de
signing since she was a child and 
knowing of Techs Costume Eco
nomics department through Dr. AC. Tucker, an American missionary 
in Brazil, Edith flew to the United 
States seven months ago from her 
native Rio with the intention of en
rolling here. Because her English 
was limited to three words, I lof 
you, Edith obtained a scholarship 
to Francis de Paul school in Los 
Angeles in order to perfect it before 
going on to higher studies.
While there, she visited Holly
wood and met such stars as Gary 
Cooper, Paul Henried and Joel McCrea. Should you ask her what she

thought of them, Edith will emit 
an expressive, Ahhh, and produce 
several pictures of herself surround
ed by them. The explanation for 
the affectionate poses? As Edith 
laughingly puts it, Because I am 
Brazilian girl  you know  good 
neighbor.
Although Edith admits that at 
first she was a little disappointed in 
America because everyone was not 
blonde, as she had been led to be
lieve, she thinks its wanderful 
now. That is, if you omit the 
brakefas. Compared to the typical 
Latin American repast of coffee and 
a roll, our breakfasts appear as din
ners and as she expressively ex
plains, I cannot take eet.
Typifying our concept of the 
South American lass with her vivid 
dark eyes and long black hair, this 
good neighbor is particularly im
pressed with the freedom of the 
American girls.
Upon completing one year at Tech 
Edith intends to go on to Pratt In
stitute in New York and obtain a 
certificate as dress designer which 
will make her the only designer in 
Rio, when she returns there to open 
her own shop. Meanwhile, our good 
neighbor is happily attending Mar
garet Morrison, and as she said, 
Only wun theeng ees wrong. The

sprang into action.
As he turned down the collar on 
his beer mug he glanced over the

to a casual inspection, and briskly 
asked what the Italian surrender 
meant to me. Now Im no dope. Ive 
been in this mans infantry well 
over fifteen weeks  and know as 
much about war as the next dog
faceso I helped him to a double 
order of experting. I eisenhowered 
about the German northern defenses 
and the possible landing areas of 
Allied forcesand the relative air 
strengths of the opposing unitsand 
all that guff. It was solid.
But it did not satisfy my boy.

What I want to know is what you 
as a soldier have to say about the 
reasons for this war.
Now that was a good opening.

Tech Coach Well Known Boxer Co. B Intramural Touch Football
Ruled By B-2-1 After First Week
By Jim
Ernie Sesto is extremely well 
qualified to be our boxing coach and 
physical instructor. After distin
guishing himself in local and na
tional fight circles, he battled his way 
to the international amateur cham
pionship as a 126-pound feather
weight in 1927.
An event for which Ernie is now 
thankful took place in 1928; he tore 
a ligament in his back and was forc
ed to quit boxing before he could 
turn professional. As a result of this 
blessing in disguise, in 1929 Ernie 
started coaching at the Pittsburgh 
Lyceum, a sporting organization. In
1930 he came to Tech as the first 
college boxing coach in western 
Pennsylvania. Although Techs box
ing teams were never championship 
teams due to the lack of material, 
a few stars developed, including Bill 
Kules j, winner of the West Virginia 
Championship and Bill Ely, winner 
of the Pennsylvania Athletic Asso
ciation Championship in their re
spective weight classes.
Army Men Organize Team
Fifteen avid football enthusiasts 
from Company D have decided to 
form a team to scrimmage the var
sity every evening. The boys are 
almost all ex-college stars, although 
some of them have had their experi
ence limited to high school ball. The 
Army does not allow its men to 
compete in college sports so these 
men are forming the team on their 
own and playing in their spare time. 
The school has furnished them with 
equipment, but otherwise they are 
entirely independent, having their 
own coach and plays. This compe
tition will be good for the Tech 
team, giving them experience 
against unfamiliar plays and a heav
ier team, experience which will be 
of great value in the coming sea
son.

Recently intramural boxing has 
taken the place of intercollegiate 
boxing at Tech . While 12 to 16 
boys could be used on an intercol
legiate team, 75 to 100 get muchneeded recreation and valuable in
struction on intramural teams. Ernie 
nover lets a boy get hurt. If the 
boy is not in good condition or is 
losing a bout badly, he will with
draw the bov and forfeit the bout 
rather than have the boy battered.
Ernie has been refereeing fights 
for twelve years. He is well known 
as a referee of both professional 
and collegiate boxing matches; he 
has refereed all the important fights 
at Duquesne Gardens for the last 
few years, including the Joe LouisBilly Conn, Fritzie Zivic, and Sammie Angott bouts. He has been 
named as one of the ten best ref
erees in the country by the New 
York writers.
In the summer of 42, Ernie and 
Mr. Frank Moses, our swimming in
structor, took a coaches course 
which was given at Chapel Hill to 
prepare them to coach the ASTP 
men now at TechTouch Football Begins
Civilian Intramural Touch Foot
ball will begin in September 20th on 
a one league basis, it has been an
nounced by Frank Lucas, head of 
the touch football committee of the 
Intramural Board. Eleven teams 
have been entered, necessitating a 55 
game s^acon. The teams which have 
entered are: Beta Theta Pi, Beta 
Sigma Rho, Delta Tau Delt, Citcom 
Clan, Kappa Sigma Delta. Uosilon, 
Theta, Xi, Tau Delta Phi, Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon, Independents, and 
the Junior Chemical Engineers.
There will be three games played 
every day, beginning at 5:20, on the 
Cut. It must be insisted the games 
begin on time, due to the fact that 
later in the season it will be dark 
before the games are finished if they 
are not started until late.
Intramural Bowling will begin 
some time near the first of Octo
ber, and games will be played, as 
usual, at the University Recreation 
Alleys on Saturday afternoons. 
Teams wishing to enter in the com
petition should begin practicing on 
the duckpins in the near future in 
order that a good tight race for the 
championship may be had.

Simultaneously with the start of the Outlaw Football League came 
the announcement that the Phys. Ed. Department was the sponsor of an 
Intra-Sectional Intramural League in Co. B. Mr. Moses, prexy of the 
Phys. Ed. Dept, invited Mike Gingold to outline the schedule and to 
handle the series. Referees were appointed, rule sheets distributed and 
the program got under way. Two fields were utilized: the Forbes Street 
field and the other gridiron on the cut. The rules adopted were a cross 
section of the Intercollegiate Football rules and those used by the Army 
Infantry.
The schedule calls for six games per week; two games being played 
each gym period. There are four eight minute periods, with short breaks 
at the quarters and half. The boys have to hustle, and do, to finish their 
games in the allotted time. This is the greatest single factor in cutting 
down lengthy arguments and any would-be crying sessions.
The first games in the Company
B Pigskin Parade got under way on 
August 28th; Section B12 defeating 
Bll to the tune of 6-0. B2-1 was also 
the victor over their platoon mates 
and won a really close game. Final 
score, 7-6. Capt. Joe Dance turned 
in a beautiful performance for the 
losing section. On the line, Burnet 
and Callaghan were the key men 
for the victorsNext in line in leather larrupin 
was the B31, B32 scuffle. Boss Einolf 
took to the air and together with 
Fake and Thompson scored three 
touchdowns to win 18-0. Quarter
back Dody of the 32 team was in
jured and Red DeHann took charge 
of the losing squad. B41 and B42 
plaved their 32 minutes for nothing 
and thats how the score stood at the 
end of the game, 0-0. Reini was by 
far the outstanding man of the 
game; with Smith, McDonald and 
Seltzer all playing good ball.
Saturday, September 4th dawned 
on the B22-B31 fracas. B31 contin
ued its winning streak with a 13-6 
victory. Big Boy Beck and Mastrogiovonni turned in good perform
ances for the v/inning outfit. 
Schmidt and Wriglev starred for the 
second platoon team. B41 beat B32,
7-0.
The next playing day saw B42 
play B51 while Bll* tangled with 
B21. The 4 and 5 game was well 
played as the two teams seesawed 
back and forth across the field. Matt 
Maley, the Lebanon Valley Flash, 
and Bobby Baldwin played a good 
game for the 5th. Cochran and 
Frederickson played for the 4th. 
B21 defeated Bll on a freak touch
down. The referees decision was upheld-under protest however  and 
another win was credited to the 
B21 team.
On September 8th, B12 and B22 
fought to a standstill;the score read
ing 0-0 at the final whistle. Mat
thews, Berkowitz and Selke were 
outstanding for the B12s. Ellison 
and LeMaster were without a tally 
for either team. Smith, Lenzini, and 
Larsen carried the brunt of the 4th 
attack.
The most recent in the series of 
footballery were the B32-B12 con
test and the 41-51 affair. The 32 
game threatened to become a rout

as the 1st platoon team succeeded in 
pulling three successive sleeper 
plays on a disorganized 32 team. Red 
DeHann rallied his forces in the 
final period of play, but the game 
was too far gone and the B12s won 
12-0. Fonte was the receiver on both 
touchdown throws with Selke on the 
passing end. Bad Sack Fleishers 
greatest contribution to the game 
was his adept handling of Hurwich 
of tlie B12 line. In the other game 
of the day Maleys combination 
clicked early in the game to assure 
a 5th victory. Snyder, and Colbe 
were the keys in Maleys attack. 
The 4th tried hard, but it just wasnt 
their day.
Intramural Board
The Intramural Board for the 
coming semester will be reformed 
on an entirely civilian basisThe 
Army students will be unable to 
participate in any joint competition 
with the civilians any longer due to 
too full a program. Therefore the 
Army members of the Board asked 
to be relieved of their duties. Mar
vin Goldberger and Joe Eiger, mem
bers of the Board last semester have 
resigned and Bill Robbins of Cit
com clan has been elected to fill one 
of the vacancies, but the other posi
tion has not been filled as yet. The 
Board now consists of Charles 
Peterson, President, Frank Lucas, 
Gail Litton, and Robbins.
Mr. A. J. Murphy, formerly fac
ulty advisor to the board has had to 
resign from his post previous to be
ing inducted into the Army, so as 
yet the board is without a faculty 
advisor, who will probably be ap
pointed in the near future.
Cwens Welcome Transfer 
Students With Coke Party
The Cwens, Carnegie Techs soph
omore honorary sorority, are in 
charge of the Twin Sister move
ment here. Students who have 
transferred to Tech are given Twin 
Sisters to help them get adjusted 
and acquainted; that is, girls who 
are in the same grade and, generally 
speaking, have the same interests. 
The Cwens are having a Coke Party 
Tuesday, October 5, 1943, at the Car
negie Union from seven to nine in 
the evening in honor of these girls.
Anne Stansbury, chairman of this 
informal affair, and her committee 
members, Jean Garland, Jean Nor
ris, and Doris Strandberg report 
that they expect to have an attend
ance of about one hundred ten girls, 
fifty-two of whom are transfer stu
dents.

Ji.o*Uf. 'Wait
Much Time Is Lost 
Eating On Campus
By Lois Brunn
It is really quite a treat to eat 
your lunch on campus. There is 
such a variety of places to eatThe 
fact that you may be certain to find 
aU your pals eatin? at the Grill or 
Inn is because they can be sure of 
having privacy while they eat. One 
of the many features of these two 
places is that one can get sufficiently 
hungry to cat by waiting in line.
If this becomes boring in the Inn, 
one need only go to the Grill where 
he can amuse himself by descend
ing one step every three minutes. If 
you are in a hurry and you are ac
companied by a starving friend, all 
you have to do is to use this simple 
system. Two of you occupy your 
time selecting a table of your own 
choice, while the other two get the, 
lunches. Its not a bit confusing. In 
fact it gives your vocal cords good 
practice yelling back and forth.
One also gets the feeling of being 
very useful by clearing off his own 
table. It is very interesting trying 
to see how many trays and dishes 
can be piled on a table before they 
succumb to the law of gravity.
The task of ten people eating at a 
table meant for four can be ac
complished very skillfully once you 
learn the technique! This technique 
is very systematic. Starting at one 
end of the table each person along 
the line takes a mouthful of food in 
succession, thereby preventing a 
cannibalistic appearance. It is a won
derful opportunity to study the 
pleasant side of folks as they pass 
your reviewing stand on their 
way to lunch.
Upon leaving the Grill you marvel 
for the rest of the day about the 
ease and comfort with which you 
lunched!

be accepted in payment for a b^nd. 
These may be exchanged between 
the hours of 11 and 12 at our Bond 
Centre which will be located at the 
entrance to Administration Hall 
from September 23 to the thirtieth.
In order to gain the full coopera
tion of the student body a meeting 
will be held today at 11:00 in room

will have an opportunity to select 
their representatives to Student 
Council. The balloting will be for 
officers in the colleges of Engineer
ing and Fine Arts, and the students 
from each college will receive bal
lots upon the presentation of regis
tration cards.
Candidates for election must 
qualify according to the standards 
established by Councils constitu
tion; however, due to the current 
problems arising from the limited 
enrollment such specific require
ments as the number of class hours 
per week and the number of major 
offices open to one candidate have 
been modified to allow greater flex
ibility for a period of one year after 
the war. However, two require
ments that have not and will not be 
changed are: (1) That each candi
date must have earned an Insignia 
award in some previous year and 
(2) that each candidate must have 
received passing grades, D or bet
ter, in all subjects scheduled dur
ing the previous year.
The combined College Election 
Party will be by no means a purely 
business function, for the secondary 
emphasis shall be placed on enter
tainment, food, music, dancing, and 
refreshing drinks. There is no ad
mission fee, and students may bring 
wives, husbands, or dates if they so 
choose.
It seems that the Fall Enrollment 
for the Evening School has leveled 
off to a point approaching that of a 
pre-war supplementary term. With 
the Vocational College discontinued 
for the duration, only the College 
of Engineering and College of Fine 
Arts remain, and the Engineering 
enrollment continues to be the larg
er, as it has been for the past two 
years.
The figures at the present time 
stands at 474 in the College of En
gineering and 251 in the College of 
Fine Arts (including Margaret 
Morrison and General students).
Comparing the enrollment of this 
semester with that of the first se
mester of last year, we have in the 
College of Engineering 474 to 751, 
and in the College of Fine Arts 251 
to 242. The grand totals are 725 for 
this semester and 1,449 for the first 
semester of last year.

Supplement - - - and why!!
For the first time since the ex
istence of the Evening Student 
Council, a current Handbook will 
fail to appear on the Campus. The 
following will show briefly why 
this action is necessary.
The printing of last years Hand
book cost several hundred dollars 
and enough are left to distribute to 
new students registering this Fall.
Registration for the first semester 
last year was approximately 1,450 
students and this dropped to 750
 during the second semester, which 
makes the outlook even worse for 
this year.
Activities Fee is based at the rate 
of 50 cents per student per semes
ter, which limits the revenue con
siderably. Quite a large expense is 
incurred in publishing of the news
paper, the Carnegie PlaidLast years Council officers and 
Plaid staff voluntarily refused sal
aries usually paid them so that the 
two previous years deficits cotild 
be liquidated.
All rules and regulations appear
ing in the Handbook remain the 
same. This supplement is merely to 
take care of any changes such as ac
ademic and social calendar, Insignia 
Awards, Council Officers, Treasur
ers Report, and Plaid Staff.
Those who registered last year 
and received the Handbook will 
only receive the supplement this 
year. New students should receive 
both. Those who were unable to 
obtain them at registration will find 
a new supply at the Registrars of
fice in approximately two weeks. 
Books may be secured by present
ing registration card.
