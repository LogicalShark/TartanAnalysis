Displays, Skits Signify 
Homecoming Activity
During the next several weeks, poundings in the middle 
of the night by the fraternity men and the singing and danc
ing of the sorority women will all be indications that Techs 
annual homecoming is approaching.
October 16 and 17 have been designated as the dates
when the Fabulous Fifties will* 
appear on our campus. Judy Fox 
a; Mike Bass, co-chairmen of 
the homecoming committees, are 
the mainstays behind all the work 
and problems concerned with 
planning such an event.
This year, stipulations have 
been made concerning the dis
plays to be judged. The size of the 
displays shall be limited to a 
maximum of 20 feet wide, 12 feet 
deep, and 15 feet high. Any fail
ure to comply with the size limits.^ns will be grounds for dis
qualification.
Time Limit
A time limit has also been giv
en which states that all displays 
must be completed by twelve o
clock noon on Friday, October 16. 
In case of rain on Thursday, this 
time will be extended until five 
p.m. The size measurements and 
time of completion will be observI ed and handled by two members 
ofypelta Skull and the chairman 
of Homecoming displays, John 
Hood. Any displays which have 
b';en disqualified will not be ex
amined by the judges. For all in
terested, the judges will make the 
first tour in a group between five 
and six, after which they will

Although twenty-five years old, 
Potemkin ranks among the time
liest films of our present decade. 
Eisenstein's masterpiece recreates 
the story of a mutiny on a Tzarist battleship that triggered the 
Bolshevik Revolt of 1905  the 
Russian Revolution. Few motion 
pictures have depicted the revolu
tion in such a documentary, stark, 
yet artful manner. From a stand
point of Russian history, Potem
kin is a classic.
Technique 
Even more important, however, 
are the movie techniques employ
ed to bring thsi theme across. Po
temkin was the first and one of 
the few pictures in history to 
create psychological impact suc
cessfully through editing. A se
quence in Potemkin called the

My Impressions of 
Khrushchevs Visit
By Jan Chaiken
I spent about two and a half hours last Thursday sitting 
only about fifteen feet from Mr. Khrushchev, and although 
this experience certainly didnt make me an expert on Krush
chev, it did leave me with a lasting impression of him and
his country. '
My impression of his country 
came also from the remarks of a 
Mr. Martynov who sat at the table 
with me along with the presi
dents of the student bodies of 
Chatham, Pitt, Duquesne, and 
Mount Mercy College.
Mr. Martynov was particularly 
silent on the topic of what his 
function was with the Khrushchev 
party, but it was quite clear that 
he was a member of the Russian 
foreign service, or perhaps a 
member of the MKVD. After ex
plaining that he would be per
fectly glad to answer any ques
tions, he refused to comment on 
the following: the American ex
hibition in Moscow, the Russian 
exhibition in New York, the Vien
na Youth Festival, the present 
state of the missile race, and the 
comparative heights of the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh and the Uni
versity of Moscow. Although he 
was a history major in college, 
he had never heard of Woodrow 
Wilson. And when he was asked 
who might be Khrushchevs suc
cessor, he replied, That is a very 
dangerous question!
General Tone
If I caught the general tone of 
his conversation, I would say Mr. 
Martynov was extremely afraid 
of saying anything nice about our 
country, and moreover he was 
even more afraid of saying any
thing about his own country that 
did not adhere strictly to the way 
the question might be handled in 
Pravda. He always seemed to 
be on the defensive.
I really dont feel I would be 
exaggerating if I said that Mr.
JAN CHAIKEN 
Student Congress President
Martynov lived in constant fear, 
not a clutching, terrifying fear, 
but a dull, ever-present fear of 
thinking his own ideas. The state 
owns not only his life and his 
home, but his mind and soul as 
well. Its a pity, if you stop to 
think about it.
Listening 
Listening to Khrushchev, I be
gan to feel that his mind, too, was 
owned by the state; but I think 
that a more accurate description 
of how I feel about him would be 
that he is sincerely and genuinely 
devoted to the cause of world 
communism. So devoted is he that 
no tactic which will accomplish 
his goals for communism is un
lawful or unethical to him. For 
instance, many, of the statements

CURTAIN GOING UP!
by George B. Speluin
Slick Flicks Click
Criticized, condemned, censored, and somewhat forgot
ten; Charles Chaplin stands out in my mind as Americas fin
est film maker. Even though we may quarrel with his politi
cal beliefs, we cannot quarrel with his genius in combining
comedy with pathos so skillfully.
It gave me greart pleasure to* 
discover that the Film Arts Society coincides with this belief. 
This year the society is showing 
one of Chaplins finest and most 
noteworthy features. The title can 
not be disclosed at this time be
cause the picture is rarely seen in 
this country  chances are great 
that no one at Carnegie Tech has : 
ever seen it. To those familiar 
with Chaplins works, this film 
will be a welcome surprise. To | 
those who have never seen The :

I became even more excited in ; 
the Film Arts series when I saw 
included Eisensteins dramatiza
tion of the Russian Revolution:

special screening of Potemkin 
this summer, I seemed thrust into 
the futureas the motion picture 
techniques appeared so fresh and 
stimulating. The greatest film of

all time was made in 1925. True 
art is timeless.
My enthusiasm did not end with 
Eisenstein, however. Film Arts 
Society is also showing the Rus
sian Earth, Stroheims Greed, 
the recent Pather Panchali, and 
nine of what seem to be some of 
the finest films ever projected.
Film Arts has this year scooped 
some of the worlds most impres
sive celluloid. Any film group or 
literate movie theatre would be 
envious.

he makes are pure and unadul
terated lies. We certainly cannot 
assume that he knows so little 
^bout his own country that he 
does not realize that he is lying, 
so it must be that he feels that 
lying is a suitable modus oper,midi in certain circumstances. 
Clearly, a man who is unethical 
in small matters is not to be trust
ed in big ones, and Im sure that 
the leaders of our country are 
aware of this.
Throughout his speech, Mr. 
Khrushchev made the point that 
if our two governments trusted 
each other, we could make fast 
steps toward a lasting peace. No 
doubt this is true, but Khrushchev 
^ ,himself is not doing a very good 
' job of inspiring any trust on our 
part, and moreover, if all coun
tries trusted each other, we would 
already have a lasting peace! I 
think we have a right to expect 
some trustworthy action before 
we give our trust.
Behind Shell
But enough about the sly and 
treacherous Khrushchev, whom 
anybody can read about in the 
capers. There is a man behind 
^mis shell, and it is my opinion 
that this man is not as confident 
as we would be led to expect. 
There seems to be at least two 
things which, by nature, he needs. 
First he seems to need the atten
tion of those around him.
I have never seen a statesman 
of any stature give a speech in 
which he played to the audience 
as much as Khrushchev did. He 
look note of every ripple of ap
plause, every laugh, every stand
ing ovation, and every hushed 
whisper, and he asked his inter
preter to tell him at what part of 
the speech the audience reaction 
came.
When he discovered that the ini
tial reaction of the people at the 
Pitt luncheon was quite favorable, 
he immediately seemed to warm 
up. He stayed on past his time 
deadline, simply making com
ments off-the-cuff. It was in this 
informal portion of his speech that

it was easy to see how he needed 
the laughter and applause of the 
audience, and how he thrived on 
it.
Referred to God
Another way that Khrushchev 
has shown his desire to be ac
cepted by his audiences is the 
manner in which he has been re
ferring to God of late. The people 
at the Pitt luncheon found it as 
least noteworthy and at most in
congruous that a declared atheist 
should bow his head during the 
opening prayer, and that he 
should specifically express his 
thanks for the message of that 
prayer and for the many prayers 
for peace which were being of
fered all over the country.
I think that these words show 
that Khrushchev is genuinely in
terested in establishing some com
mon bonds between himself and 
the American people. But I dont 
believe that his approach has been 
very successful, because most peo
ple seem to resent his remarks, 
especially when he goes so far as 
to say, God is on our side. 
Goals
The second thing I think he 
really needs is for his country to 
be best, that is, to be better than 
the U. S. Why is he so adamant 
in his claims that Russia will pass 
by the U. S.? His goals for his 
country dont seem to be in terms 
of: Our country will accomplish 
this and this so that it will be a 
better place to live in. Rather his
attitude is We will do this and 
this so that we will pass the U. S. 
Isnt this the attitude of one with 
an inferiority complex? Why is it 
necessary that Russia have the 
same goals as we have?
In the case of two competing 
businesses in the United States, 
they are competing in the same
market for the same customers, 
and if one doesnt keep up with 
the other, it will fall by the way
side. But that is not the nature of 
the competition between us and 
the USSR, at least not as far as 
we are concerned. What is 
Khrushchevs purpose in feeling 
he must pass us? Im sure I dont
know.
Well, I have watched Khrush
chev for several hours, and I have
shaken his hand, and I have seen 
what a charming woman his wife 
is, and I think I have gotten a 
better picture of Khrushchev the 
man than I had before, but he 
still remains an enigma to me.

St. Vincents Downed 
By Fighting Tartans
Carnegie Tech took charge early in its game with St. 
Vincent and left the field at halftime with a 14-0 yead. There
after the game was completely in the hands of the opponents, 
who had an excellent opportunity to leave Pitt Stadium with 
a tie in the first conference game for each side.
The Carnegie coaching staff* 
tried to liven up last weeks un
imaginative offense by flanking 
the tailback wide outside the left 
end and by moving wingback Curt 
Burrell to fullback. Although the 
flanking tactics did not produce 
any outstanding results, Burrell 
was a reliable running mate for 
John Zinni, who once again was 
tb* soark plug of the team.
Varied Attack
The Tartans marched for scores 
in each of the first two periods 
with a varied attack of passes and 
sweeps, including a crowd-pleas
ing play in which Marty Poad 
neatly deflected an aerial into the 
arms of Zinni. The first Tech I 
score came on a roll-out pass from 
Muth to Arendas immediately fol
lowing a touchdown throw to Pete 
Wilson that was called back be
cause of a penalty.
In the second period freshman 
Furman Smith replaced Zinni at 
tailback and on the first play cut 
off tackle for six more points. 
Pete Schlegel, who now has three 
PATs in as many tries, added 
what proved to be the margin of 
victory.
Defense
The Tech defense contained the 
opponents attack nicely in the 
first half, though St. Vincent 
seemed reluctant to pass. Despite 
the heat and with very little rest, 
the Plaid line was doing another 
fine job in the second half when 
the squad received a severe blow.
John Zinni was knocked un
conscious while making a vicious 
tackle, and the seriousness of his 
injury was unknown when he was
carried from the field. Not only 
were his playing abilities missed, 
but also the loss of his leadership 
and spirit had a definite demoral
izing effect on histeam-mates.
Two Aerials
Soon afterwards the opposition 
was able to heave two aerials to 
receivers behind the right corner 
of the Tech secondary for two 
touchdowns. Luckily for Carnegie, 
the St. Vincent place-kicker hit 
high on the ball on his second at
tempt and defaulted a one point 
lead to the home school.
St. Vincent, however had not 
given up and it took two inter
ceptions by Burrell and Carl Vantine, to keep them from adding 
another score. Once again Techs 
defensive unit seemed to outshine 
its offensive unit, although for the 
most part both units are composed 
of the same players.

As sure as little apples, Newton knew that what goes up must come down.
But when it comes down to a 
really pleasurable filter ciga
rette, its what goes upin front 
of the filter, that isthat makes 
the difference!
And theres where Winston 
had an inspired idea  FilterBlend! Winston specially selects 
choice, mild tobaccos, then spe
cially processes them for filter 
smoking. The result: FilterBlend up front of a modern fil
ter. Thats what makes Winston 
a complete filter cigarette.
Filter-Blend also makes 
Winston Americas beSt-selling, 
best-tasting filter cigarette.Take 
it from Sir Isaac:
 You dont have to be hit on the head to know that
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should!

C Club Has 
Annual Dance
The Carnegie Tech Varsity C 
Club held its annual scholarship 
dance in the Tech gym last Satur
day night.
The dance was the first all
school dance of the year, and a
the first three. Caldwell is out 
for cross-country for the first time 
as a sophomore, and looks like he 
could becorrie a fine runner.
Bill Sproul, Don Perotta, and 
Steve Strasen form the remainder 
of the team. A junior who letter
ed in 1957, Sproul could be the 
man to push coach Uhl Swaneys 
crew to a season comparable to 
last years. The 1958 harriers were 
9-1 in dual meets and placed sec
ond in the West Penn meet.
large percentage of the 250 m 
attendance were freshmen. The 
thirteen piece band of King 
George and His Men, a young and 
promising organization, played 
stock arrangements most of the 
night.
The theme of the dance was the 
scholarship awara which was to 
be given to a player of one of 
Techs varsity teams. Howeverbecause there was not enougu 
time prior to the dance to process 
scholastic records the award was 
not presented. The presentation 
will instead be made at Call Day 
during Homecoming.
