The Scotch and Soda Clubs an
nual revue has become a feature 
of Spring Carnival. Those Carnivalgoers lucky enough to have 
obtained a ticked for this evenings 
performance of Heres To You, 
can look forward to a show in the 
tradition of the last threewith 
slight variations.
Although some of the old 
Scotch and Sodaites are still there 
Bobby Challener, with two new 
pantomimes, Roily Kraus with his 
gay and precise dancing, Marvin 
Einhom with that dazed and 
slightly insane .expression on his 
facea lot of the.people tnat Tech 
audiences have learned to associ
ate with Scotch and Soda are gone. 
Their places are being filled, in 
one way r another, by the capable 
and pretty, tooAudrey Bot
kin, by red-headed, loony Gary 
Davis, and by an enterprising 
youth named Ernie Motyl, who 
can not be described by any ad
jectives at all. Like a Rembrandt 
painting, he must be seen to be 
appreciated.
The scene-designers and tech
nical directors, I am happy to say, 
have hit finally on th type of 
scenery that fits (1) the Music 
Hall stage (a difficult one at best), 
(2) a musical revue, and (3) the 
Clubs comparatively limited bud
get. What has been done with that 
lecturers platform topped off by 
gilt organpipes is hard to believe 
Scotch and Soda has succeeded 
in making a theater out of the 
Music Hall.
At the time of writing this, I 
.have only been able to hear the 
music in a piano arrangement. It 
is really superlative stuff; without 
a doubt the best non-professional 
music I have heard anywhere 
at least, in some cases, a great 
deal more. If the bandand the 
band arrangersdo it justice, itll 
do a lot to make Heres to You 
one of the countrys better college 
revues.
R. O. T. C. Units 
To Hold Review
The annual formal inspection of 
the two R.O.T.C. units at Tech will 
be held on Monday and Tuesday, 
May 12 and 13. Lt. Col. Roy M. 
McQutchen, 5th Engineers, Ft. 
Belvoir, Va., will journey to Pitts
burgh for the inspection of the 
Engineer Unit, while Lt. Col. L. 
S. Stickney, Sig. C., of the Signal 
Office, Hq. Third Corps Area in 
Baltimore, will look over the Sig
nal Corps Unit.
In all previous inspections con
ducted annually by War Dept, 
representatives, both units have 
been rated Excellent, the high
est rating awarded.
A comprehensive program of 
drills and classroom instruction 
has been arranged for the two 
days in order that the two in
spectors may get a good crosssectional view of the work cov
ered by the R.O.T.C. at Tech.
Citcom Holds Picnic
Highlight of Spring Carnival for 
Citcom Clan will be a picnic and 
scavenger hunt at 1:30 on Satur
day afternoon.
Clan members will meet at the

History of Campus Week
Campus Week came into being 
in the spring of 1920 when the 
school decided to hold a gala 
alumni reunion. The plans for 
this affair were so pretentious that 
it was necessary to enlist the aid 
of the students. The student body 
entered into the spirit of the oc
casion so well that the subsequent 
Campus Weeks became more of 
the student than an alumni affair.
The first Campus week was 
quite different from the more re
cent ones, stressing alumni and 
school functions more. The fes
tivities lasted for three days
Thursday, May 13, through Satur
day the 15. The initial event was 
a General Assembly held Thurs
day afternoon in - the Carnegie 
Music Hall, and was followed by 
the Tap Day exercises which took 
place on the Athletic Field. In the 
evening, Open House was held for 
the returning Alumni. The sched
ule for Friday included interclass 
contests and stunts in the morning, 
a faculty-senior baseball game, 
one with Tech vs. Geneva in the 
afternoon and a R.O.T.C. parade to 
Flagstaff hill in the evening. This 
was followed by a lawn fete, band 
concert, a play in the open air 
theatre, and a large dance from 
9:00-1:00. On Saturday morning 
the alumni-varsity baseball game 
and the interscholastic and Geneva 
track meets were held. Saturday 
afternoon witnessed gay fun-mak
ing in the form of a circus which 
featured clowns, side shows,
Beano, the snake eater, a greas
ed pig, race, and the usual assort
ment of hilarity and nonsense. The 
The carnival closed Saturday 
evening with another band con
cert, a smoker, and the Alumni 
banquets.
Buggy Races
This Campus Week also saw the^^%urbinC,d 
innovation of the Sweepstake MAivin-Burtin 
races. .All vehicles which were Tom RUey
entered were required to have four 
wheels, and a two man team which 
could alternate in pushing and 
driving. In addition to this, it 
was required that the two rear 
wheels be interchangeable and that 
during the race each buggy should 
stop in the pit and exchange the 
rear wheels.
Coronation
The following year a vaudeville 
show replaced the General As
sembly, and the circus was moved 
to Saturday night. In 1922 the 
Drama Department put on a play 
in lieu of the circus. This year 
saw the beginning of our present 
Campus Queen festivities, for the 
students elected the schools most 
popular beauty and cTowned her 
the Queen at the Mardi Gras 
festivities. The play produced by 
the Drama Department was re
placed in 1925 by a musical re
vue presented by the entire school. 
Two years later, the crowning of 
the Queen was made much more 
pretentious by holding a Corona
tion ceremony at the Coronation 
dance which took place Thursday 
evening.
In 1929 Demon Gloom reigned 
over the campus as the Adminis
tration abolished Campus Week 
since it had become too much of a
student affair and took too much 
time from studies. However, 
all of the events were not done 
away with. The Open House was 
moved up to its present position, 
and a Migratory dance, Tap Day, 
Boat Ride, and farcial coronation 
were held, but not in conjunction, 
with each other. The ensuing year, 
however, saw the revival of the 
celebration, but on a modified 
scale. It assumed the name of 
Spring Carnival and opened with 
the Coronation dance and cere
mony on Thursday evening. On 
Friday the Fair and Tap Day wore 
held, and on Saturday a play and 
the Sweepstakes were held.
During the next two years a 
dance on Friday evening and a 
Musical Revue on Saturday were 
instituted.
Carnival Toduy
The year 1937 saw the Carnival 
assume something of its present 
aspect when one of the nations 
leading name bands was obtained 
for the informal dance, the coro
nation was moved to Friday even
ing, and the formal dance was 
held on Saturday evening. The 
following year the Spring Carnival 
took on the present pattern, and 
the one which will largely be fol
lowed this year.
Spring Formal 
Features Rogers 
Novel Rhythm
Dick Rogers brings his fifteenpiece orchestra to Spring Carnival 
tomorrow for an evening of dance 
rhythm that is definitely in
dividual, scintillating, and ohso 
smooth.
The basis of Rogers music is 
his famed trombone section which 
plays into megaphones, football 
cheer-leader size, placed at differ
ent angles from the floor. Rogers 
doesnt believe in using trumpets, 
so his trombones are completed 
by three cornetsand slide cornets 
at that. A saxophone section is 
worked in with these brasses, and 
the effect achieved is really some
thinglike dancing on air.
Dick started off as the featur
ed vocalist with Will Osbornes 
band in 1934, and then joined Jack 
Hylton in Germany as vocalist and 
pianist. He toured seventeen 
countries and capitols of Europe 
including London, Paris, Berlin, 
Rome, Moscow, Cairo, Stockholm, 
and Belgrade, and while he was in 
Vienna he played the BoogieWoogie for the Duke and Duchess 
of Windsor. In London he was 
contracted to writci (the book, 
music and lyrics for the Bea Lille 
show, Many Happy Returns. 
On his return to the states in 1988, 
Rogers rejoined Will Osborne and 
wrote a number of song hits in 
his spare time. One of them, 
Between 18th and 19th on Chest
nut Street was Number One on 
the Hit Parade for several weeks, 
and others' include: Wouldst That 
I Could But Kiss Thy Hand, Oh 
Babe, Dry Bones, and Pompton Turnpike. Dick has also been 
featured in Paramount and War
ner Brothers Pictures.

Wotta Nite!
IIow Nol lo See 
Tommy Dorsey
Yes, I saw Tommy Dorsey! I 
saw fifty-million other people too, 
all of them congregated outside 
waiting to get in the gym. These 
people were not as considerate as 
Dorsey. In the two hours that we 
enjoyed each others company, they 
tramped on my feet, shoved me 
aside, blew smoke in my face and 
did everything else that they could 
,to make me feel uncomfortable.
When I got inside the gym I 
" glimpsed Dorsey. He wore a 
white coat and had a flower in his 
buttonhole and was just leaving 
the stand for intermission. I also 
got a peek at him when I was leaving just after intermission.' My 
. girl had to be home at two oclock 
and leaving two hours to stand 
in line at the check room that 
made us late. Thats the reason 
we left early.
After I got rid of my date, I 
went down to the Greeks with the 
boys and got in at 8 a. m. this 
morning. My paper, the TARTAN, 
expects me to report at 10:00, but 
you see that Im still in bed. Oh, 
well, someone will put the paper 
out. Someone always does, dont 
they?
Y Plans Retreat
Carnegies Christian Association 
cabinets are sponsoring retreats 
for the men and women of Tech 
next weekend. The mens retreat 
will be held at Cooks Forest this 
year and the women will spend 
the weekend at Ogilbie Park, West 
Virginia.
The retreats are open to all 
students. All women interested 
should sign up immediately in the 
office of the Dean of Women. Mr. 
R. V. Davis, secretary of the Y.M. 
C.A., will take the names of inter
ested men. This popular event is 
an annual occasion sponsored by 
the Y cabinets.
Gay Innovations 
Feature Annual 
Tech Fun Fest
Carnival will get off to a good 
start today with the sweepstake 
preliminaries at 10:00 a. m. The 
pushers will cover the campus 
course and then tune up their 
buggies for tomorrows finals.
In the Sylvan theatre this after
noon at two, Margaret Sullivan, 
surrounded by her court, will be 
officially crowned as Carnival 
Queen, when the school pays hom
age to her royal Highness. Honors 
will then be sprinkled on the stu
dent body, as meritorious work is 
rewarded by call to honoraries. 
This ceremony climaxes the sol
emn rites of Spring Carnival and 
the rest of the schedule is given 
over to entertainment.
Ferris Wheel
After the calls have been made, 
booths will sprout along the main 
stem, hi from of the Senior fence. 
Sororities have concessions to sell 
the traditional carnival tidbits, 
lemonade, pop, peanuts, candy, and 
the like. Games of chance as seen 
in all the amusement parks will 
line the sidewalks, sponsored by 
the fraternities. Ring-tossing and 
similar amusing games will be 
their specialty, with the cost kopt 
at a minimum so that all can par
ticipate.
The Carnival Committee has 
rented the ferrls-wheel and chairo-pi a no seen on tho Cut. Any Tech 
student can ride the vehicles free. 
They lend atmosphere to Carnival 
_ and(give It the spirit that will help 
insure everyones having fun.
While the games are going on, 
street dancing will bo in progress. 
The street In front of the Hut and 
Arts school is expected to be 
jammed with Carnival goers who 
should get their fill of dancing 
during the gala days.
Heres To You
Tonight Scotch and Soda will 
give their revue for Carnivalitcs 
at Carnegie Music Hall. The show 
was enthusiastically received by 
last nights audience, and will be 
in top form for tonights perform
ance.
Saturday morning the sweep
stakes finals hold the center of 
attention. The boys will have 
their hearts in this race for Its 
the one that really counts. Canoe 
tilting, a comparatively recent in
novation, takes place immediately 
afterwards in Panther Hollow. 
This spectacle can be viewed from 
Panther Hollow bridge as well as 
from the Hollow.

Ping-Pong Finals 
Get Under Way 
T omorrow Morn i ng
Table tennis matches are in 
full swing come carnival time. 
There were about twenty-nine men 
and fifteen women entered at the 
time of the first match. As yet 
there is no return on the womens 
matches but the men have whit
tled each other down and only the 
finalists remain.
The finals, which will get under 
way Saturday morning at ,11 
oclock, will see Secan and Belt 
pounding the little white sphere 
for the mens singles crown. This 
should ibe a fine match with a lot 
of speculation as to the outcome. 
The Goldberger-Twery doubles 
team will meet Sions and Claypool 
to determine the winner of the 
mens doubles section.
As mentioned before, the out
come of the womens matches and 
the mixed doubles remains a mys
tery, but, all things considered, 
the Harwig-Allmendinger team 
and the Mack-Pincus team should 
be the finalists. In the womens 
singles Meryl Pincus seems to be 
th .probable winner. Again her 
name bobs up in the womens dou
bles in which she is teamed up 
with Shirley Stine.
If you will notice, the time  of 
the play-offs is at 11 oclock to
morrow morning.

About ten oclock tomorrow 
morning, the keenest competition 
of the Carnival week-end can be 
observed near the entrance to 
Maggie Murph and the vicinity of 
Gymnasium, this excitement being 
centered around the various bug
gies entered by the fraternities 
in the Sweepstakes event. For the 
most part, the pushmobiles are 
essentially the same as last year 
with very few alterations, but sev
eral of the campus aggregations 
have entered new buggies, namely 
the Theta Xis and Phi Kaps.
The team of each entry consists 
of a driver and five pushers who 
propel the buggy over the five sec
tions of the course, each pusher 
taking one section individually. 
The changes from one pusher to 
another must take place inside of 
changing zones ten yards in length 
located at logical points on the 
course. The beginning of the 
course is at the bottom of. the hill 
at the entrance to Margaret Mor
rison. The track is up the hill 
past the gymnasium and the 
blinker into Schenley Park. The 
buggies then speed down the hill 
past the Phipps Conservotory and 
they really speed, some buggies 
attaining a velociey of 35 miles 
per hour. The course then turns 
into the street at the bottom of In
dustries and proceeds past the Ad
ministration Building and the 
Commons to the finish line at the 
top of the hill by the Gym.

Tomorrow at eleven oclock 
the annual canoe-tilting contest 
will begin in Panther Hollow 
Lake. Mike Bosak and Bill Jam
ieson, who comprise the committee 
for the promotion of the canoe tilt, 
say that from all indications, this 
years event will fully equal, if not 
surpass, any of the contests held in 
the past.
There are about twelve or four
teen teams entered at present. 
Each dormitory, fraternity, and 
the Citcom Clan, has a team en
tered with the exception of the 
A.T.O.s. The committee has been 
trying in vain to get a couple of 
girls teams entered m the fray. 
Whether this wou*d succeed or not 
is hard to tell, since the muddy 
waters of Panther Hollow are not 
conducive for bettering ones ap
pearance.
Last year the D.U.s entered 
quite a number of teams, one of 
which paddled away with all the 
laurels, but this is no indication 
of what will happen to this years 
group of filters. All that we can 
predict is that there will be five 
contests, with the best team com
ing out on top.

by staying at home. We admire 
your spunk, Peggy.
Dave Gilman's date is from 
Washington and Howie Etzelfs 
from New York, but Chuck Hartel

Minnesota.

too, together, too, huh?

Social Relations 
Receives Library
Social Relations will assume a 
greater importance with the ac
quisition of a remodeled wing of 
Industries Hall. Official approv
al has been obtained from the 
Board of Trustees, plans have 
been drawn and the work of re
modeling will begin at the end 
of the present semester.
According to Larry Miller, Su
pervisor of Equipment, the en
larging of the facilities of the 
Social Relations Department is 
another step in the direction of 
a well organized and equipped 
department.
On the second floor of Indus
tries, opposite Room 227, where 
the present seminar-office is lo
cated, the Electric Wiring and 
Construction shop will be torn 
down. The equipment will be 
moved to Machinery Hall.
The wing will then be changed 
to include two floors. The first 
floor will contain four offices, one 
large classroom, and four seminar-offices, all of which will be 
used for increased enrollment of 
the Relations classes. The second 
(loor will include two small of
fices and a large modern library, 
seating llij students. The library 
will be furnnished with those 
books which are related to the 
Social Relations program.
