The reports of the last Judgment of the Society 
of Beaux Arts Architects have just been received. 
According to these reports, of the forty-four stu

A Treatment of an Aquaduct, twenty-eight received 
mentions. Of these, two received mentions with 
special honor, Messrs. E. W. Boyer and J. M. Gray, 
both night students.
Sixteen ateliers submitted drawings in this class, 
of these the Carnegie Technical Schools was one 
of the only three which had two students mentined 
with special honor.
In the Class B Plan problem, A Villa and Garden, 
fourteen students of the Technical Schools submitted 
designs. Of these eleven received mentions. Two 
received first mentions, Miss E. A. Knox and Mr. 
Brandon Smith, both night students. The design of 
Mr. Smith was the only one submitted in this class 
which received special commendation. Eleven 
ateliers submitted designs in this class, the Techni

A CANOE EXPERIENCE.
One bright morning in August, a friend and I 
started from the hotel for a paddle. As it was just 
nine oclock, we decided to paddle up to the head 
of Muskoka Lake, where there was a narrow creek. 
The lake was quite smooth when we left the hotel, 
so that we made good time going up.
The creek is about eight miles long and the water 
in it is always very calm, as it is so very narrow and 
is sheltered by rocks, weeds, and trees on both 
sides.
After paddling up the creek quite a long distance, 
we decided that by the time we arrived at the hotel 
it would be twelve o'clock, so that we turned our 
canoe in the direction of home. When we reached 
the place where the creek joins the large lake, we 
found that a terrific wind-storm had come up while 
we had been up the creek. The water was lashing 
against the shore and the wind was getting colder 
every minute. Not a boat was to be seen on the 
entire lake. We both knew that it was dangerous 
to start across the lake in a canoe in those enormous 
waves, but we felt that as our friends would be wor
rying, we must at least make an attempt.
At first the canoe easily cut the waves and we 
made pretty fair progress; but in a few minutes an 
enormous wave came from each direction, com
pletely upsetting our canoe. This turn was so un
expected that it was impossible, for a moment, to 
realize what had happened. Then I found myself 
swimming for shore, with my companion after me. 
As it was not more than fifty yards away, and as we 
both knew how to swim, we made the distance easily. 
The waves were coming in towards shore, so that 
they soon brought, our canoe within reaching dis
tance.
We now said that we would run no more risks, but 
would hide the canoe in the woods and walk home. 
The distance was over seven miles from there, and 
we certainly felt very uncomfortable in our soaking 
wet clothes. The sun had gone under the clouds 
and we were shivering like two lost sheep.
It was nearly three oclock when we reached the 
hotel. To our surprise, we found that all the men 
in the vicinity had hired launches and had gone in 
search of us, while the members of our own fami
lies were almost frantic with fear.

The Senior Dressmaking class had its first lesson 
in tailoring last Thursday night. There were thir
teen in the class, including four outsiders. The
tailor, Mr. Recchia, superstitiously objected to the 
number, but seemed satisfied when Mrs. Gibbs as
sured him that there would be fourteen next week.
The work is very interesting and the girls all feel 
sure that it will be of great benefit to them. Some 
object to the fact that the class meets at night in
stead of during the day, but the difficulties in the 
way of attendance can be overcome if one tries.
Most of the girls do not go home at the close of 
the afternoon session, but remain until evening. A 
pleasant hour over the tea cups, and a friendly stroll 
about the building serve to make the time pass
quickly.

Even though Miss Carlin is very much interested in 
the raising of chickens, she has decided to return to 
school.
The Senior Dressmakers are exceedingly sorry 
that one of their number (Miss Anna Wilson) had
to leave school on account of sickness at home.
They hope she will not forget them entirely.
There is great excitement in the Senior House
hold Arts division over a rumor that Dan Cupid has 
singled out one of their number as his next victim. 
He steadfastly refuses to tell which one of the girls 
he has his eye onhence the excitement. The girls 
go about wildly inquiring, Is it you, but as yet 
have had no convincing evidenceor rather con
victing evidence.

Although the School of Applied Science has not 
beeen entirely removed to the new Science building, 
most of its departments have, and the building has 
begun to take on an aspect of business. Heretofore, 
when anything was said about the student body 
taking charge of its own government, and to some 
extent the policing of the buildings, it was met by 
the statement that it would be impossible to do any
thing as long as all the schools were using the same 
buildings. This argument no longer has any force, 
at least not in the Science building as no other school 
uses this building.
Another argument of considerable force has been 
that there was no loafing place aside from the halls. 
This state of affairs will end in the very near future 
as we have been promised two rooms for exclusive 
student use in the new building. One of these 
rooms is intended to be a study room exclusively, 
while the other is to be a smoking and lounging 
room. The setting aside of the last named room 
as a smoking room is provisional, however, on the 
students acceptance of responsibility for its maintainence. The Schools will furnish the room or at 
least place the major part of the necessary furni
ture in it and turn it over absolutely to student man
agement with the understanding that the students 
themselves see that no damage comes to the room 
itself, or the furniture in it.
It has also been suggested that the trophies 
be placed in this room and in all probability they 
will be. If this is done it most certainly will be up 
to every man to do his little bit toward keeping 
down rowdyism in the smoking room. It seems to 
us that the authorities are meeting us more than half 
way in this matter and there should be no hesitation 
on our part in accepting the room on the very gener
ous terms that it is offered.
The committee on Athletic Constitution has at 
last finished its work and the result of their work 
is printed in this issue of The Tartan. We recom
mend that everyone interested, and every student
in the mens schools should be interested, give it a 
careful perusal. By the time it comes before the 
various class meetings it should be pretty thoroughly 
understood by everyone and any defects may then 
be quickly rectified.
PLAY OFF WITH PITT.
On February 4th, the game between our Hockey 
team and the team of Pittsburg which resulted in a 
tie, will be played off. Any one who has seen the 
two teams perform can not have much doubt as to 
the outcome, but the game will be a good, hard, 
interesting contest, and probably the last of the 
Hockey season. Tickets will again be on sale here 
at the school and every one should procure his ticket 
here as we get a percentage from all tickets sold 
here, but nothing from those sold at the Gardens.
ADVICE TO SCHEDULE MAKERS.
The following is taken from the University Week
ly News, of Cincinnati, and as considerable of it is 
apropps, we reproduce it:
Starbuck Smith, unmoved by the enthusiasm of 
Mondays meeting, gave a clear, sane, conservative 
speech, filled with sound advice and warning. We 
trust it will not go unheed. He advised caution 
and conservatism in schedule making. The schedule 
is being made now, it is something we can watch 
now. It is very important.
No teams should be booked, whom it is probable 
will defeat us, and whom we shall gain no credit by 
defeating them. We have in mind such teams, of 
which Marietta is an example. The first few games 
should be with teams we are reasonably sure we 
can defeat, so as to give our team practice, strength
ening them, and giving them courage for the really 
big games. We must not make this years mistake 
of opening with a big, heavy game.
In booking big games care must be taken to secure 
only such teams as it will be an honor to defeat, 
and no disgrace to lose to. Another matter which 
was not sufficiently safeguarded this year, was the 
conditions in the contracts in regard to players and 
particularly in regard to the officials. Great care 
should be taken in order that the proper officials 
are provided by the contract. We cannot afford to 
have our opponents ring in officials or players, be
cause of some loophole in the contract. Still, an
other important consideration is the number of 
games to be played away from home. In our opin
ion any long trip is extremely inadvisable; it demor
alizes the team, and greatly lessens the chances of 
victory. Not more than two games should be played 
away from home, and these trips should not be of 
any considerable length. We will strengthen our 
chances of victory, our pocket books and our spirit 
by playing as many games as possible at home.
This advice is given, because it is good common 
sense. We have spoken plainly and hope it will at 
least be considered by the schedule makers.

WORD FROM FOSTER.
Fred Foster, Tech 08, who is now in the employ 
of the South American Development Co. of Guaya
quil, Ecuador, wrote a very interesting letter to 
Secretary Field about a month ago. Believing that 
some of it would bear repetition, we take the liberty 
to print several portions (from the expurged edi
tion, however).
"My dear Mr. Field:
Just a few remarks to serve as renewers of auld 
acquaintance and to inform you that in ones idler 
moments he may compart the glories of a throne 
with a little grain of sand, for at this writing, I who 
was, am located in an environment that causes me 
to entertain the strongest belief that the poet Gray 
was here given his impulse to write those stirring 
lines'. Far from the maddning throngs, ignoble 
strife, etc. And could he have been a contemporary 
of mine, I should have most certainly maintained 
that I was the rose who was blushing unseen and 
wasting its fragrance on the desert air.
I arrived here two weeks ago after a long, tedious 
trip from Guayaquil. I should perhaps, modify the 
latter, for that portion of the journey in crossing 
the mountains was fraught with much excitement 
not to mention danger. I embarked at Guayaquil on 
a small steamer for a port, by name, Santa Rosa. 
After some two days of travel I arrived at that port, 
one of the dirtiest, most desplicable places I have 
ever seen, and was forced to remain there over night. 
In the morning I engaged a mule and started on the 
long journey over the so-called western cardillerras. 
My attitude toward my mount during the earlier
part of the trip, that portion along the lowlands, was 
something akin to inhuman, for I believe there is 
something, in the very nature of a mule forbidding 
one using polite language; but in the highland dis
tricts when crossing passes and going around ra
vines on narrow trails, Mr. Mule had my respect 
and I just leaned over on his neck and called him 
all the endearing terms my vocabulary contained. 
At the end of three days trying riding I reached 
Portovelo where I am destined to stay untilwho 
can say?
Portovelo cannot be called the typical mining 
camp, but a mining camp nestled in amongst the 
lower ranges of the Andes on the plateau about 
3000 feet above sea level. None of the distracting 
influences of the average mining town are present 
and that fact no doubt accounts for the absence of 
all but a poor grade of native miners. The white 
population here numbers about twenty-five and they 
all come under the nomenclature of Gringos, altho 
but five of six Americans are in the camp. Everyone 
carries a revolver that serves admirably for a re
minder to the natives, who believe that every Gringo 
is a crack shot, but Heaven help me if they call my 
bluff, for I couldnt hit an elephant at ten paces.
I must leave for the present and back to the 
mines.
THE CRAFTSMAN CLUB.
The Craftsmen held their first meeting of the new 
year, Friday evening, January 15th, 1909, and some 
interesting subjects and plans were debated. They 
are planning to put on an interesting theatrical 
sketch, thanks to Mr. Haas.

For the benefit of the class it will be well to repeat 
in substance the remarks of Mr. Aude, our advisor. 
Commenting on the large number of tardy arrivals 
he gave it as his opinion that persons who come 
in late, not only do an injustice to the instructor, 
but in a larger measure, to the class as a whole. 
The time allotted between periods should be amply 
sufficient for all necessary purposes, which, how
ever, do not include a nice confidential chat or a 
pipeful.
In the opinion of the editor, this is very good math
ematics, and, will greatly assist the individual in 
simplyfying his personal equation.
Here's one that will remind you of Prof. McTag 
gart:
The class in very elementary chemistry was hav
ing one of its early sessions. The matter of sea
water came up. Peters, said the teacher, can you 
tell me what is it makes the water of the sea so 
salty?
Salt, said Peters.
Next, said the teacher. What is it makes the 
water of the sea so salty?
The salty quality of the sea-water, answered 
Next, is due to the admixture of a sufficient 
quantity of chloride of sodium to impart to the 
aqueous fluid with which it commingles a saline flavor 
which is readily recognized by the organs of taste."
Right, Next, said the teacher, go up one.^ 
Youths Companion.
WantedA plentiful supply of jokes, grinds, com
ments, notes, sketches, reminiscences, anecdotes, 
caricatures, poems, themes, etc., for the next edition 
of the Thistle. Hand allcommunications to Leroy 
A. Hoffman, class historian.
Now, boys, get together and let the world at large 
know of the coming greatness of the members of 12.
Mr. Griffiths has appointed the following Social
ists: Messrs. Helm, Kearns and Roberts.
Mr. McTurk has appointed the following as mem
bers of the Auditing Committee: Messrs. Cole, Mer
ten, Moran, R. Griffiths.
This representative aggregation of men should 
effectually prevent any bare arm deals, Mr. Laboon considers himself big enough to manage the 
affairs of the Athletic Committee single-handed.
Archibald Reginald Percival Kearns was seen in 
a street car the other evening expostulating and 
evicting humorous remarks to a fair damsel going 
home from the hall of enlightenment. We never knew 
that he was a ladies man. And he was stung for 
the carfare, too; at least Weber says so.
We have it on good authority that Mr. Sees pro
tracted absence is not due to the Greene County 
patriots, but to a bad cold.
This dialogue occurred at the Newman mansion 
recently:
Well, Jay, what are you studying in economics?
Graft, father.
Now, of what earthly use will that ever be to 
you?
Oh, I dunno! Say dad, for $5 I wont let mother 
know why you were late for dinner last night, and 
Ill fix it so you can go to the club this evening.
The coming 1912 smoker will evidently be the 
event of the term. The Tech Mandolin and Glee 
Club has unanimously voted to furnish part of the 
entertainment. Fellows, do not make any engage
ments for February 11th, for that is the fateful night.
CIVIL SOCIETY MEETING.
The January meeting of the Civil Engineering 
Society was held in the new school building on Sat
urday evening.
The meeting was a very successful one and in spite 
of the severe weather a large attendance was re
corded.
The entertainment of the evening consisted of 
short addresses by several members of the classes 
in Civil Engineering.
Mr. Baker, a sophomore, gave a particularly inter
esting account of his experiences in the U. S. Navy. 
He served in the navy for several years on the Vicks
burg and Oregon, and has seen the sights of San
tiago, Manila, Hong Kong and many other foreign 
ports. y
Mr. Siesel, a member of the class of 08, who starts 
in a short time on a trip to Europe was present and 
spoke a few words of farewell to the Society.
As usual, a lunch was served by the refreshment 
committee and the Society adjourned till, the next 
regular meeting.

To say too much is to attract attention. Once 
upon a time a fellow was treated to an impromptu 
bath, just because he said a few more words than 
were advisable for one in his position. It would 
indeed be unfortunate to be compelled to administer 
the second degree, but this hot air is becoming un
bearable. Everybody hopes that the generator of 
the said hot air is intelligent enough to realize, that, 
to indulge in many more witticisms will be to invite 
disaster.

On Friday afternoon the draftsman class, headed 
by Mr. Day, made a tour of the Jones and Laughlin 
steel mills. The guide knew the ropes, the class 
saw everything worth seeing. There was some 
speculation as to whether Neely would be allowed in 
the mills, but as there was nothing there that could 
be carried off without the help of a crane, he was 
admitted.
Last week an eating club was organized at 319 
Craig street. The club has-not been named as yet; 
the present members deeming it more advisable to 
wait until the membership is complete before adopt
ing one. For information as to rates, etc., talk to 
Newhouse, second year Pattern Maker, or Draehbar,

A special meeting of the Craftsmen Club is to be 
held in Assembly Hall, Friday evening, January 22d,

WHITE FRIARS BEGIN WORK.
The first call for candidates for the chorus of the 
White Friars was met with considerable enthu
siasm last Wednesday night. Another trial for the 
chorus will be held in the Assembly Hall tonight at 
7.30. The same chance will be given to new men 
who come out at that time as was given last Wednes
day. It is hoped many more will appear, so that 
the number can be chosen from as large a group as 
possible in order to get the best material in the 
Schools. It is not necessary to do anything but come 
out to the trial, and do what everyone else is trying 
to do. About forty turned out, and considering 
the fact that the night was .so bad it was a rather 
good showing, but many more have signified their 
intention of coming out, and tonight will be posi
tively the last chance given anyone to make the 
chorus.
Business Manager Steen, when interviewed, stated 
that the White Friars have received a substantial 
loan from the Student Activities Fund, and are there
for sure of making a number of week end trips, leav
ing Pittsburg Fridays, playing the same night and 
the next, and returning Sunday. Among the places 
to be visited in such a way are, Titusville, Wheeling, 
New Castle, Franklin, Warren and Cleveland. The 
play will be ready for presentation the first week of 
May, when the trips will be commenced. The Pitts
burg performances are at present scheduled to take 
place the first week of June. Three performances 
are to be given in Pittsburg; a matinee and an 
evening under the auspices of a charity yet to be 
selected, and the other an evening, with our own 
patronesses.
Considering that the success of last year was made 
under almost incredible difficulties, lack of financial 
backing, previous experience, and the trouble of get
ting a proper play and coach, the present season 
with the backing, the experience, the right coach 
and the student body awake to the fact that it is 
something worth while, are all things that can hardly 
help but make this years production one that will 
make them all sit up and take notice.
Don't forget the trial for chorus in the Assembly 
Hall at 7.30 tonight; open to every bona-fide under
graduate of the Carnegie Technical Schools. It 
doesnt cost anything, and all you have to do is to 
come.
