ye When Carnegie meets Temple on
scthe gridiron this Saturday to open 
e\the Tartans football season, an inbfteresting drama will be unfolded 
dcbefore the eyes of the many specfTrtators assembled at the huge Pitt 
W Stadium. Perhaps this exciting 
inedrama will not be felt by many of 
lythe fans at the Bowl because it will 
prbe fought not on the actual grid
iron but on the sidelines away from 
the struggle that will ensue on the 
gI field. It will be the old battle bes, tween youth and age, ambition and 
tj experience, daring and shrewdness. 
( For on these sidelines will be 
0 fought the battle between that 
grizzled veteran of many football 
campaigns, Pop Warner, and our 
own Howard Harpster.
Compare the records of these 
two mentors both newly acquired

 coach at the College of The Pacific

Many Alterations 
Made on Campus 
During Summer
Many extensive changes have 
\ been made in the appearance of 
.j the buildings on the campus dur[I ing the past summer under the di
rection of Colonel Fairley, superin
tendent of buildings and grounds.
The principal project begun was 
the movement of the Industrial 
Chemistry laboratory from the 
basement to the lowest floor of the 
I east wing of Engineering Hall. In 
its new location the laboratory will 
be on the same level as the en
trance to the mine. Since this im
provement involved considerable 
changes in the building, the lab
oratory is not yet completed. Ad
ditional equipment has been order
ed and it will be installed and the 
laboratory finished within six 
weeks.
The space in the basement 
formerly occupied by this labora
tory has been converted into a 
classroom for the use of the R. O. 
|T. C. A classroom and a drawing 
room has also been constructed on 
the top floor of the central portion 
pf the Industries Building.
A new steam line, nearly GOO 
i-feet in length, was laid to Mellon 
'Hall, to Birch Hall, and to 5064 
jPorbes Street, to replace the old 
line which was not large enough 
^to suppy the steam necessary after 
(rhe Brown property was acquir
ed.
Six thousand square feet of new 
,lsidewallc was laid during thes sum
mer, principally between Carnegie 
Inn and Margaret Morrison Col
lege. The roadway and walks south 
of the College of Fine Arts were 
idened and the area around the 
[new Faculty Club room, adjoining 
the Commons, was graded.
President Baker has been 
especially interested in the plant
ing of English ivy and climbing 
roses to improve various spots on 
the campus. When the planting of 
hivy is finished this fall nearly 700 
[^individual plants will have been 
[planted around the different build
ings.

and upperclassmen, who are in

Building on Wednesday, October 
4, 1933, at 11:30 a. m.

Pres. Baker Answers Query 
Are Too Many in College?
Theie Is a Surplus and Uneconomical Excess 
Of College Men, Declares Carnegi _ Head 
In Address Over Nation Wide Hook-up
"There is at, present a surplus 
and uneconomical excess of college 
men, said President Baker in a ra
dio address delivered last Tuesday 
over a nation wide hook-up on the 
question, Do Too Many Men Go to 
College? This, President Baker 
said, is, first, because the colleges 
fail with certain of their students 
to achieve results that are worth
while, and second, because certain 
students (somewhat the same 
group) have not sufficient interest 
in intellectual questions to justify 
the expenditure of time and money 
that a college course demands. 
Some men of exceptional gifts 
should be in college and are not. 
Some of mediocre ability are, and 
should be anywhere you please, 
except hearing lectures and doing 
bookish tasks.
Overproduction of college men, 
he said, is a form of wastefulness 
that creates overproduction Un
important courses given by unim
portant men is wastefulness on the 
part of the universities, and lack 
of serious purpose in going to col
lege is w'astefulness on the part 
of the students. These forms of
extravagance undermine the ideals 
of sound thinking, sound scholar
ship and national intelligence.
Education, said President Bak
er, should be a great stabilizing 
and conservative force to prevent 
people from being swept off their 
feet. It should not be merely 
something to be turned to when
ever we are confronted with a 
crisis; it should be a means for 
the cultivation of the individual 
something with a subjective pur
pose, not an objective goal.
The man with exact scientific 
training," President Baker declar
ed, is likely to be more competent 
to deal with the complexities of 
manufacturing and distribution 
than many of the present type of 
executives. We may expect to 
find, therefore, more men occupy
ing high positions as administra
tors of great concerns who have 
had a teclinuical education.
If the times are so completely 
out of joint, President Baker con
cluded, that there should be an 
overproduction of thoughtful and 
resourceful college men, we may 
be sure that sooner or later they 
will find a way to rearrange the 
affairs of the world so that the cap
able and the industrious will have 
their chance.
MARYA. HUSBAND 
NAMED WOMENS 
SOCIAL CHAIRMAN
Ceilingof Thistle Hall 
May Be Decorated 
Soon by Council
Mary Husband 34, has been ap
pointed Womens Social Chairman 
of Student Council1. The office is 
a new one on Council. Miss Hus
band, who will receive equal privi
leges to those of the Mens Social 
Chairman, will be particularly as
sociated with womens social 
events on campus. Miss Husband, 
a senior in the Science Depart
ment, is president of the Y. W. 
C. A. and is also senior Senate 
Representative and a member of 
Student Council.
Student Council voted, at the 
first meeting of the year, to hand 
over immediately to Dean Glendenning Keeble, Dean of the College 
of Fine Arts, the balance which 
was left from the 1033 Arts Ball, 
for use in Dean Keebles scholar
ship fund. The money is to bo 
given without the usual delay of 
one year, so that it may be put to 
work at once.s
At the same meeting it was vot
ed that the balance from Student 
Council for 1932-1933 be donated 
for the purpose of repairing and 
decorating the ceiling of Thistle 
Hall. Shorey Allan, president, ap
pointed a committee consisting of 
Colin Stewart, chairman, and 
Robert Schell, to interview the 
proper authorities for the purpose 
of determining the approximate 
cost of the repairs.
The business of the meeting also 
included theapproval of 7:00 P. 
M. as the most desirable time for 
meetings. Therefore, Council will 
continue to meet at that time.
Upon the motion of Clifton Carr, 
Social Chairman, Student Council 
approved the petitions of the fol
lowing organizations for social 
events in Thistle Hall on the dates 
mentioned: Mortar Board, for a 
tea dance on Sept. 27; Delta Skull, 
for a tea dance on Oct. 5; Cwens,

Little Jaunts to Europe Decrease
As Faculty Sees America First
Trips to Europe seem to be de
cidedly lacking among the faculty 
this year. "America First was 
the motto for vacationing profes
sors, as they toured and visited 
the United States from Chicago, 
east. Only such individualists as 
Dr. Baker, Prof. Elmer Kenyon of 
the Department of Drama, Dean 
Mary Watson Green, Miss Clara 
Miller of Margaret Morrison, and 
Professor Grapin, Department of 
Architecture, ventured beyond the 
bounds of the Worlds Fair on the 
west and the Atlantic Ocean on the 
east.
Mr. Kenyon, not satisfied with 
what the Fair could offer, went 
west and took in Hollywood as 
well. Dean Green also traveled 
westard, making stops at Rockford, 
Illinois where she was formerly 
connected with the college there; 
Chicago, Micliillinda, Michigan, 
and Wisconsin. Dr Baker, Miss 
M,iller and Professor Grapin all 
voyaged to Europe, Dr. Baker re
turning to his favorite Germany 
and the latter visiting France, his 
homeland.
Mr. Risedorph also found his 
way as far west as Chicago. His 
summer was spent farming in 
Michigan.
Several members of the faculty 
spent some time in New England 
this summer. Dean Tarbell, of 
course, was to be seen in his 
favorite haunts around Cape Cod, 
the scene of his literary accom
plishments last year. Dr. Webster 
Jones was another vacationist 
whose eastward journeying led 
him to Cape Cod. Mr. Carroll, who 
summered in Boston, and Dr. Griffiss, whose vacation was spent in 
Maine, also were to be found in 
our New England states this sum
mer.
Carnegies lone faculty repre
sentative in the south was Dean 
Glendenning Keeble who trekked 
southward to South Carolina.
Dr. Max Schoen and Dr. Foot
ball Marks found their way to 
Canada during vacation time.
Nearer the Pittsburgh region, 
Professor Hower retired to his cot
tage near Vermillion, Ohio; Mr. 
Kirkpatrick threw off the care of 
Summer School in the.general di
rection of Lake Erie; and Bert 
Munhall vacationed in his cottage 
at Soho.
There is one member of the fac
ulty, however, who cannot be class
ified. M,r. Alan Bright, registrar, 
covered as much territory as any 
Europe-bound individual. He not 
only saw Pennsylvania as a sum
mer state, but went east and west 
as well. Mr. Bright visited most 
of the Finger Lakes of New York 
state, pausing at Cornell and beau
tiful Cayugas waters; he trav
elled westward to the shore-line 
of Chicago and tramped miles at 
the Fair; then he returned for a 
rest to the familiar territory at 
Cooks Forest.
Delta Skull to Hold 
Tea Dance Thursday
Al Howard and his orchestra 
will furnish the music for the 
Delta Skull Tea Dance which 
will be held in Thistle Hall 
Thursday afternoon, October 5, 
from 4 to 6.
The committee headed by 
George Goodridge is planning 
for a capacity crowd of fresh
men and upperclassmen at this 
second Tea Dance of the semes
ter.
The tickets which are selling 
for 35 cents may be purchased 
at the dance or from the mem
bers of Delta Skull, junior class 
mens honorary.
Delta Skull, the sponsors of 
this dance, choose their mem
bers from the junior class on 
the basis of their activities and 
their personality. They have 
charge of the General Assem
blies and the Junior Prom.
Numerals Rush 
Will Be Initiated 
^ At Temple Rally
A Numerals Rush will Ije stagod 
in the Carnegie Bowl at 7:30 noxt 
Friday evening, preceding the Tem
ple game. The affair will be in

small pole. The side having the 
most hands on the canvas at the 
end of the contest wins.
The second event will be a tug 
of war between the freshmen and 
sophomores. There will be fifteen

the Kiltie Band will play, the 
cheerleaders will lead cheers, and 
Coach Howard Harpster will

Professor David Gustafson, head 
of the Department of Printing, has 
received word that three students 
in the Department of Printing, 
James L. Clark, Ralph N. M,yer, 
and Richard W. Harvey, have been 
awarded first, spcond, and third

R. O. T. C. Drills 
Begin Thursday
An unofficial report from the of
fices of the R. O. T. C. Military 
Department reveals that the en
rollment in the freshman division, 
although somewhat loss than that 
of last year, compares favorably 
as, to percentage of the entire stu
dent body with that of previous 
years.
The regular uniform drills of the 
Carnegie R. O. T. C. unit are 
scheduled by the department to be
gin Thursday. According to Cap 
tain Ackerman, plans are being 
formulated to revamp tho old R. 
O. T. C. band, which is made up, 
for the most part, of members of 
the Carnegie Kiltie Band, to fur
nish the music for the drills soon. 
As heretofore, the unit will form in 
front of the Administration Build
ing.
Members of the advanced divi
sion of the unit will be given their

Air-Conditioning Course 
Is Scheduled; Fees 
Are Unchanged
Night school registration, which 
began last night and will continue 
till tomorrow night, shows.signs of 
equalling, if not increasing, last 
years total, according to Dean 
Roscoe M. Ihrig, Director of Night 
Courses. The cause for this im
provement may bo laid to tho gen
eral increase in employment and 
clip recent pickup in industry, 
which has enabled many students 
to, meet tho financial obligations 
necessary for re-entering night 
school.
There have been a few additions 
to the night school curriculum. A 
course in Air-Conditioning, sched
uled for a three-hour period on Fri
day evening, is boing offered, al
though it is not as yet llstod in tho

Tartan Classes 
Give Freshmen 
News Instruction
The Tartan in its effort to give 
the student body a much better pa
per from both literary and news 
point of view, as well as to be
come one of the leading college 
newspapers in ths country, has in
augurated a new system of classes 
to teach the freshmen the inside 
workings of the paper. This class 
which meets today for the first 
time under the direction of the 
managing editor, Joe Adams, will 
be made up of fresh
men who are interested in 
becoming members of the Tar
tan literary staff. In these classes 
tlie new students will be taught 
the various ways in which a re
porter should and should not ap
proach the person he wishes to in
terview, the type of question to 
ask, and how to put the facts on 
paper so that the article will not 
be merely a list of cold, hard state
ments assembled in an uninterest
ing fashion.
After learning the art of writing 
news stories, the class will be 
taught headwritlng and the vari
ous phases of work carried on by 
the junior editors. In this will be 
included the principles of make-up 
which will enable reporters to fig
ure out where their articles will be 
placed and the amount of copy 
they should write. The freshmen 
will also learn how to read the 
proofs and make the final changes 
before the papers are turned out 
at full speed.
Mr. Adams Intends to have sev
eral Instructors from tho school 
and Mr. James, head of the News 
Bureau, take part Jn some of his 
classes. Students will bo graded 
and only tho best will bo allowed 
to remain and become members of 
the Tartan Staff.
The first class will bo held at 
twelve-thirty today in Room 115, 
Industries Building. If anyone Is 
not able to come at that time, he 
should report at the Tartan office, 
Room 10, Industries Building at 
four-thirty or after on Friday. Due 
to an assembly the first meeting 
will be quite short. After that a 
time will be arranged which will 
be convenient for all.

Mr. Larkin Vacationing Gets RingSide Seat for Cuban Revolution
Dr. Baker is not the only one on 
our campus who managed to steal 
across the deep to foreign lands 
this summer. Mr. Charles W. 
Larkin of the Department of Build
ing Construction, well known to all 
engineers, packed up his family 
on the 19th of August and set out 
for that center of revolutionary 
turmoil, Cuba. He claims he was 
not anticipating any excitement, 
but it is rumored abroad that se
cretly he hoped for some of the 
thrills that came with the out
break of tho second revolution -on 
the day he was planning to leave 
Cuba.
Even his trip down was not de
void of excitement for the boat was 
held at Key West for twonty-olght 
hours by a hurricane whoso winds 
reached a velocity of ninety miles 
per hour. Arriving at Havana a 
day late, the party put up at a 
Spanish hotel which was right on 
the prado of main square, and 
where a good many of Machados 
followers woro executed. Guided 
by Pussy Cat Costello, who 
earned his nickname when he mado 
off with the cat belonging to Ma
chados granddaughter during tho 
plundering of the presidential pal
ace, they were taken to see Morro 
Castle. Here in one wing were im
prisoned many of the former presi
dents political henchmen and 
members of his secret police.
At two oclock on the day before
the boat was scheduled to arrive In 
Havana to take Mr. Larkin and his 
family back, the steamship agent 
notified them that owing to an
other hurricane the boat had not 
yet left Florida. This, however, 
according to Mr. Larkin, was only 
an excuse since the steamship 
company probably had wind of tho 
impending uprising and wished to 
stay clear of it. At three oclock
that same day the second Cuban
Revolution broke out and Presi
dent de Cespedes and his party 
were defeated. In this new shift
ing of power the University stu
dents soemed to Mr. Larkin to be 
more active than anyone else, a 
University professor heading tho 
new government.
At ono o'clock tho noxt after
noon, Mr. Larkin headed for tho 
Pan-Amorlcan Airways office to 
get reservations on tho three
o'clock piano which unfortunately 
had long boforo boon sold out. Just 
as ho was beginning to givo up 
hope of over getting his family off 
tho Island a big forty passongor 
Clipper piano came in with envoys 
from President Roosovolt to Am
bassador Welles. They secured 
seats, packed, and wore In tho air 
on their way homo by two.
They saw very little violence al
though there was quite a bit of ex
citement about tho airport since 
it had been on a plane of the Pan(Contlnued on Page Three.)

Predictions that Carnegies en

due to the current economic condi-r

The total day school enrollment

it apparent that tho maximum drop

Registrar Alan Bright pointed 
out that While wo are sorry to

the reduction. Even in normal 
economic times tho fluctuation 
from year to year and from semes

Mr. Harpster Is Blessed 
With Abundant Reserves
the other boys, for they are all 
fighting just as hard for the first; 
team jobs.
For fullback, it Is a toss-up be
tween Johnny Sayles and Joe 
Mihm. Both are good steady play
ers and are on a par as things 
stand now, so either one will be a 
valuable asset to the team. Mihm, 
by the way, is showing the best 
form at punting the old pigskin 
well down the field.
In spite of the large supply of 
good men from which to choose, 
several of our old players are go
ing to be greatly missed. Co-cap
tains Kavel and Sample will be 
very conspicuous by their absence 
after their performances of last 
year.
PLAID LEADERTHE 
TUESDAY 
QUARTERBACK 
 
BY JACK LOWES
Plaid Mentor Finding it Difficult to Discern Subs 
From Regulars; Stewart, Croft, Burzio and 
Bevevino Seem Firmly EstablishedPanthers Fail to Show 
Form in Defeating 
Wash-Jeff 9-0Carnegie promises to have a 
team worthy of its status, for the 
season of 1933. With the presence 
of our new mentor, the renowned 
Howard Harpster, and the accessi
bility to a large and strong squad 
from which to draw the team, this 
year should be one of our best of 
football years.
For the line positions, there are 
quite a few candidates. Aspirants 
to the end berths are headed by 
Capt. Red Stewart and Lib 
Lewis. However, George Goodridge is expected to see much serv
ice, in spite of a recently sprained 
ankle, which may or may not be 
serious. Kay Burns is also sure of 
at least a second-string job.
At the tackles will be Dutch 
Croft and either Forsman or Dolloway. Croft is sure of one position, 
and, at present, Dolloway is being 
shown the preference for the other. 
Then, too, there are Lee Nutter 
and Earl Hudson, one of the mem
bers of last years Plebe team.
Bernard Burzio is headed for the 
right guard on the first team. 
Burzio is playing a fine game this 
year and should have no trouble 
holding down that position. There 
is doubt as to who will fill the 
other guards place in the line, but 
of John Anderson, Clyde Iieinzer, 
and Henry Dreshar, I-Ieinzer seems 
to be slightly in the lead. That is 
by no means definite as yet, for 
both Anderson and Dreshar are 
working hard.
Centering the ball are Jerry 
OToole and Steven Trbovicli. 
OToole now has the edge, but for 
a new man on the squad, Trbovich 
is showing ability. Like Hudson, 
he is one of the contributions of 
last years freshman team to the 
Varsity.________________________________
These players conclude the 
probable line for this year, and 
desirous of playing behind them is 
another large group of good boys. 
The number of aspirants for the 
four back positions rivals that of 
the candidates for the line berths. 
From a squad of players with Var
sity experience and a few promis
ing former Plebe backs, there 
should be a backfield capable of 
doing big things.
Calling s:gna:s win he Angelo 
Bevevino, Charlie Spisak or Bill 
Carlson. For this position is also 
a noticeable preference, and it goes 
to Bevevino, -with two years of ex
perience. Carlson, who is a ver
satile backfield player, is just start
ing his second year on the squad, 
and the younger Spisak is new to 
the Varsity this year.
Probable halfbacks are W. Spi
sak, ' Steve Terebus, and Owen 
Bowser as offensives; Ken Spenser, 
Elmer Vorderburg, and Carlson as 
outside backs. Of these, Terebus 
and Vorderburg are likely final se
lections. However, they will have 
to overcome hard competition from
The defeat last Saturday of W. 
& .T. by the Pitt Panthers by a 
score of 9 to 0 was not as decisive 
as might bo expected, but merely 
showed that both tho Panthers and 
the Presidents have mighty strong 
ball clubs this season. A more 
fitting finish to the game would 
have ended it a scoreless tie, but 
opportunity knocked in the last 
four minutes of play and a field 
fioal executed by Weinstock from 
IJie 19-yard line brought a 3-0 ad
vantage to Pitt. Shortly after, in 
the last minute of play, ODell ran 
the ball forty-five yards for a touch
down, which brought the score to 
9 to 0. This second opportunity 
was opened when Weinstock inter
cepted a low pass from King, giv
ing the hall to the Panthers on the 
40-yard line. The Presidents, in 
the second quarter, got the ball 
down to tho Pitt 8-yard line, but a 
replacement of the Pitt first-string 
eleven quickly drove them hack to 
the 20, at which point an unsuc
cessful attempt at a field goal 
ruined the Proxies bid for victory.
The exhibition of Saturday after
noon shows that two of the games 
scheduled for the Tartans are sure 
to be hard lights. Unless Tech is 
able to eke a victory from the 
Temple Owls this coming Saturday 
in our first game of the season, 
both Pitt and W. and .T. will he 
strongly favored to win over the 
Ski bo gridders.
A threat much nearer to home 
at the present time is the success 
that "Pop Warners Owls had over 
South Carolina last Friday even
ing. A strong attack led by Stonik 
opened large holes in the South 
Carolina lino, and a large crowd 
in the Temple stadium cheered the 
Owls to a 2G to C victory.
ONE OF THE MOST COLORFUL COACHES IN MODERN FOOTBALL 
will be tho guest of Carnegie Tceh this week-end. Glenn S. (Pop) 
Warner is truly tho dean of American football slnco Alonzo Stagg re
tired from tho big loaguoo. The Old Fox has produced ouch otarc an 
Jim Thorpe, Ernie Nevorc, Jock Sutherland, and Corbun, AIJ-Amcrican 
guard from Stanford who played oo brilliantly here against Pitt Inst 
year. "Hooks Sample, who captained last yeara Scotch machine and 
who took no back talk from anyone an a guard hlmoelf, nald that Cor
bun was about tho sllckeot guard he had ever noon perform.
Call For Freshman 
Football Candidates
Candidates for the freshman 
football team are requested to 
report to Mr. Irwin in the gym. 
Candidates for manager report 
at Field House.
WARNER GOT HIS TITLE OF THE OLD FOX because or tiie de
vices ho invented to foil tho opponents and still remain within the 
rules. One of his earlier stunts wan to place a pocket in the jerseys 
of tho pluyors. A back could thon place tho hall up this pocket and 
run Unmolested for a touchdown while the opposition searched vainly 
and frantically for tho man with tho hall. Another one that sometimes 
proved very offective wus the old substitution gag. Late in the game 
lie would begin throwing in subs In great number. It was then diffi
cult to tell just who was in the ball game and who wasn't. One of tlio 
lads who really was still In the game would start walking off the flold 
with the rest of the outgoing players and, wlion the ball was snapped, 
would suddenly dash down the field to he the recipient of a forward 
pass. Still another trlclc he employed was to have a football, about 
actual size, sewed on the players jerseys; this would of course con
fuse tho opposition, much in the same way as tho pocket stunt. Lasl 
year when Hank Days W. and .1. team came to town, the Proxies had 
considerable brown on their shirts, and Wally Steffen, sensing some
thing putrid in Patagonia, immediately demandod that a white ball be 
used.
The great teams put out by Warner at Carlisle, Pitt, and Stanford 
stand as a lasting memorial to the genius of this man. He is the or
iginator of tho so-callod Warner Bystein, the most widely usod ofTensivo in use today, although its popularity seems to bo waning because 
of its apparent failure to cope with the Notre Dame system.

PICKING A WINNER IN THIS SATURDAYS GAME in of course a 
hazardous proposition, but most everyone seems to think hes got the 
Inside dope, and I guenn I am no exception. Temple's team In big and 
green this year, and It Is my opinion that the Owls are going to find 
it awfully difficult to stop some of those screwy-looklng trick plays 
for which Carnegie teams arc famous, or should I say notorious? It 
Is my prediction that the Tartans will defeat the Philadelphians by 
two touchdowns. Most newspaper dope Is Invariably wrong, but there 
are plonty of fans on the campus who will be praying this one is an 
exception.
By SCOTTY CHARLES
Red Stewart, captain of this 
years Plaid Football machine, has 
been a sterling player of the game 
for the past five years. He started 
on the Lorain High school squad 
back in the G. O. Ds with a Frank 
Merriwell field goal of 53 yards 
against Sandusky High school. 
After graduation from high school 
he embarked on a brief but bril
liant career as a bricklayer, aban
doning this trade to play left end 
Tr the sensational Kiski football 
team of 28.
Following his graduation from 
Kiski in 29 he entered Carnegie as 
one of the most promising men on 
the Freshman squad. After cap
taining the plebe team throughout 
this campaign, he headed for the 
varsity and made the squad hands 
down. From the day he first 
donned a varsity uniform he was 
the regular first string end. 1-Ie 
topped off this first season with 
another sensational play against 
N. Y. U. when lie caught a pass 
from mid field and ran for Carne
gies only score. Last year he 
continued his great play with 
sterling exhibitions against a tough 
schedule. Besides beiiiR a versa

this season, they play two hard non-conference foes in Carnegie Tech

considers our team such a worthy adversary while passing off such

reins at Temple,
The career ot Carnegies now 
coach, Howard Harps ter, is natur
ally much shorter but perhaps no 
loss spectacular. "Harp" is tho 
greatest football player ever pro
duced at Carnegie. In tho memory 
of all students of tho game, his 
great exploits oi! the gridiron aro 
still fresh. As quarterback of tho 
team in 2G, 27, and '28, ho 
achieved many great feats, but his 
accomplishment of beating tho 
great Notre Dame team almost 
single-handedly is tho greatest of 
all. In tho first encounter his two 
long Hold goals won tho game; iu 
the second, his superb field-generalship, kicking, and running brought 
victory. Immediately after gradu
ation I-Iarpster became coach of 
tho Shadysido Academys football 
team. His coaching ability was 
soon recognized and he was signed 
to direct tho Geneva College Foot
ball team. With Don Lovowoll, his 
old teammate at Carnegie, as as
sistant, I-Iarpster soon brought 
Geneva into prominence by leading 
the team to two Tri-State Titles.
It is just a toss up whether War
ner and his new Temple team will 
roach victory over I-Iarpster and 
his Tartans. A crowd estimated be
tween fifteen and twenty thousand 
is expected to view tho curtainraiser of Carnegies 1933 season. 
At all evonts the crowd will see 
real football as tho stage is set 
for drama and excitement.

THAT that's that and Ill be

A number of new courses have 
been added to the regular schedule 
of night courses in each college 
for the coming year. Of special 
interest to students in the Depart
ment of Architecture and also 
architectural draftsmen of the
Pittsburgh vicinity, will be the
course on the practice of architec
ture and mechanical equipment of 
buildings, being offered for the
first time by any higher institution 
of learning.
Although this course is intended 
primarily to help graduates in 
architecture and others engaged in 
the profession to prepare them
selves for examinations held by
the State Board of Examiners of 
Architecture, it is open to any who 
wish to acquire the general infor
mation covered by the course.
The course "will include lectures 
by specialists, and assigned read
ings with written tests in all prac
tical subjects.
There will bo six attendance 
hours per week, but the course 
does not carry credit either toward 
a certificate in Architecture or to
ward tho degree offered by the In
stitute.
Night students interested in pub
lication work are asked to report 
this Friday evening at 7:30 p. m. 
in the Tartan office located in the 
lower end of the first floor of the 
College of -Industries Building. 
Several staff positions are open for 
which all regularly registered night 
students are eligible.
Work done on the Plaid leads to 
an insignia award. Successful can
didates will be appointed to staff 
positions, three of which yet re
main unfilled. These positions con
sist of an associate editor from 
each of the night colleges.
Previous publication experience, 
although desirable, is not neces
sary as all students will have an 
equal chance for the positions.
Dr. Laurence F. Shaffer, as-* 
slstant professor iu psychology, 
has completed a new text-boolc for, 
his course in Mental Adjustments. 
During the five years he has taught 
at Carnegie, Dr. Shaffer ha3 work
ed on this book in order to givo 
tho students a satisfactory book 
for his psychology course.
The text-book, deals with the ap
plication of psychology to wluiti 
might be called personal problems 
principally emotional difficulties 
and social conditions. Tho psychol
ogy itself is not limited to use by 
only a certain group of people, 
such as advertisers or teachers, 
but may bo applied by tho cosmo
politan class to problems of living. 
Tho first half of tho book, devoted 
to the fundamentals of psychol
ogy, deals with problems of native 
and acquired behavior, heredity, 
learning, and motivation. The sec
ond half has to do with getting out 
of adjustment with living, and 
with the resultant readjustments 
to conditions. Various types oC 
these adjustments are discussed 
and translated by Dr. Shafferad
justments by defense, by ailments, 
by repressions.
The preliminary edition form, for 
new text-boolcs has been popular 
with students on campus for tho 
past fow years. The book is typed 
rather than printed, and ,the type 
and illustrative drawings photo
graphed to form copies. Correc
tions may easily be made by the 
author to insure perfection of tho 
first printed copy.
The staff of the Plaid joins in 
extending to their old acquaint
ances a hearty welcome back to 
Carnegie. The last year was a 
tough one, but we muddled 
through somehow, and should all 
be ready to beein our studies with 
renewed energy and vigor. For 
are not business conditions improv
ing, employment increasing and 
the general outlook for the future 
better?
The backers of NRA tell us to 
spend as freely as we may to help 
others that are less fortunate to 
get along. How could we spend 
our money better than for educa
tion? Beside putting some o the 
coin of the realm into circula
tion, we will be providing ourselves 
with that which has incalculable 
value, and which will aid us in our 
future efforts to advance ourselves.
Further, when the boom does 
come, the need for trained men 
will be even greater than in the 
late lamented days of prosperity. 
Those who sacrifice their bankroll 
now to return to their studies will 
reap their reward in the form of 
higher wages and better jobs which 
will soon be available in the wake 
of the Blue Eagle.
So lets all get together again, 
and repeat our fine performances 
of last year. We made the grade 
in spite of unemployment, worry 
and broken hopes. Adversity has 
made more good men than it has 
broken bad ones. It rests entirely 
with the individual whether or not 
it will be a make or a break. With 
the economic situation clearing, the 
wise individuals will be those who 
take advantage of the present 
period to absorb as much knowl
edge as possible in order to be 
prepared for the inevitable up
swing.
A series of free public lectures, 
entitled the Interpretation of tho 
Financial and Commercial Tenden
cies Since 1311, will be given in 
connection with night school dur
ing the coming year. A lecture will 
be given each Monday evening 
from 7:30 to 9:30 in Room 101 in 
the College of Industries.
Tho course will be conducted by 
Dr. W. J. Calvert, a practical busi
ness man and student of econom
ics, who will come from New York 
City especially for this purpose 
each week. Dr. Calvert is a retir
ed physician and a former head of 
the Department of Medicine at tho 
University of Missouri.
During the earlier part of tho 
course a practical description of 
fundamentals economic prinicples 
will be given; in the subsequent 
lectures those of financial and com
mercial events since 1911. The ob
ject of tho lectures is not merely 
to outline the recent businesshis
tory but it is to find an explanation 
for business events.
The course will bo somewhat 
similar to a course in preventative 
medicine in that the public will bo 
shown how to take care of them
selves in the future. Throughout 
the series the economic principles 
used will be presented so that tho 
layman will understand, although 
at the beginning a practical 
description of tho principles which 
will be used will bo given.
Dr. Calvert is preparing material 
for a book in the fields which will 
be covered in the course, and be
fore publishing it ho wishes to se
cure tho reaction of others to his 
discussion. In presenting his sub
ject in lecture form, he hopes that 
part of the period may be used for 
questions and answers.
The course will not carry aca
demic credit and it will ho open to 
all persons interested, whether or 
not they are enrolled at Carnegie.
Howdy, Tartan. It is sorta good 
to be greeted with the weekly after 
the summers vacation. Congratu
lations, all the editors, assistant 
editors, staff bosses, etc., etc., etc. 
Certainly made an imprint on me. 
The weekly measures up to those 
of past years and shows how well 
the understudies heed their les
sons. It was hard for me to real
ize that a new staff has taken hold 
of the paper. It is most assuredly 
a leading college newspaper. Well 
done, staff.
change his text without first re
deeming all the second-hand books 
on the market. That would be an 
effective curb on the text book 
artists. I have been taught a les
son in regard to the old text books, 
so yours truly is waiting until 
classes begin to find out which text 
book will be used and then make 
my purchases.
My 'ramble evidently merited 
consideration, not a word censured, 
so I guess I can take it to mean 
that I'll have a column of (blank 
blankblank) inches to fill each 
week from now until the May flow
ers make their appearance. My 
efforts shall be to fill the space ailoted to me for this column.
Speaking of text books brings to 
my mind the padlocks we pur
chased for our lockers. I suppose 
it will be in order to use these 
locks again, that Is, providing we 
can remember the combinations. 
Ill have to look around for mine. 
Guess there will be some announce
ment relative to this question in an 
early issue of Tartan.

of practical application of tho 
particular recommendations.
This week will see registration 
in full swing for the night stu
dents. Yes, even before this edi
tion of Tartan goes to press, there 
will have registered some hun
dreds of. night students. Registra
tion seems to be a bit early this 
year, and I notice also from the 
school literature that on Thursday 
evening the first night session, will 
begin. What will those students 
do who have classes on Monday, 
Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings? 
Well they will have to wait until 
next week to start, and incidental
ly to get acquainted with their 
profs.

There were plenty of armed Chil

Among the passengers on this

Her husband had been in hiding for 
two months and if found, his life

arrived safely.
No, everybody doesn't go to night

prove his standing, why not sell 
him Carnegie Tech? Tell him 
about the courses which are offered 
and bring him along with you on 
registration night, perhaps you. 
may get him interested and be the 
means of starting him up the lad

From  last week's Tartan I 
gleaned that there must have been 
some concrete work done about 
the campus. Perambulation walks 
(sidewalks in case you are in 
doubt) have been widened in and 
about the Carnegie Inn. And, who 
knows, there may be several 
other improvements too numerous 
to mention. All of which makes 
me that much more anxious to be 
back again and looking around. Of 
jcourse, we could hardly expect a 
summer to go by without Mr. Orbln 
doing something, even if it were 
only tearing out something old and 
putting in something new.
Y.M.C.A. Continues 
Unemployed. School
Because there are approximately 
190,000 people unemployed in Al
legheny county, the emergency 
service committee of the^ Down
town Branch of the Young' Mens 
Christian Association has decided 
to continue the Leisure Time 
School which proved invaluable to 
hundreds of young men last win
ter. The institution opened yester
day.
Twenty-three per cent of the stu
dents enrolled last winter have 
since obtained employment. How
ever, 76 per cent of last years en
rollment have indicated a keen de
sire to continue their work in the 
school since practically all of them 
have no prospects for employment 
this coming winter._________________
Another thing which bothers me 
again this year is the question of 
books. Gee, when I look at my 
shelves and see all the books I 
have waded through, I commence 
to think I have a young Carnegie 
Library sprouting. Some of the 
books were acquired with the 
thought in mind that I would be 
able to use them in my classes 
second-hand so to speak. Imagine 
my chagrin when I found out that 
the instructor decided to change 
the text. Just my luck. Stung

The College Attitude
The first step in college liJe is the hardest and longest. The 
change from public school to college brings the student into an 
entirely different environment in which lie is a little be
wildered and must mark time until1 he can adjust himself to new 
conditions. If he develops the right attitude before he starts 
through college, his way will be much easier.
To many students entering college perhaps seeing so-called 
collegiate pictures and glamorous magazine stories have an 
erroneous conception as to what college life is really like and 
why they are really going to college. The battered Ford, 
ornated with many stickers and signs, the bell 'bottomed trous
ers, and other absurd styles in dress and manner are more like
ly to be found on the high school campus rather than at college.
The college man has his pleasure in a well regulated man
ner. lie is conscious that he is where he is, to study and get 
the full benefit from his instruction so that he will be trained 
thoroughly for his profession. He realizes that good habits 
must be formed, for in this period of a mans life the habits he 
forms will be those he will follow in after years. The college 
man recognizes the priceless value of good companionship and 
tries to cultivate worth-while friends.
The most important stones in the first step of collegiate life 
are those on which are marked modesty,* sincerity, and 
hard work. If you were captain of your high school foot
ball team, or president of your class and considered a big man 
in your circle, dont let it mean too much now. You were good, 
it will be admitted, or you wouldnt have reached that position, 
but tho better way to impress your college associates of your 
talents is through positive action rather than words. Dont 
dwell on the past and let it be a detriment to your future suc
cess. Develop modesty.
Bo honest with yourself and with others. Dont ration
alize too much especially in relation to your studios. Its pos
sible to slide through college but tho scars will always remain. 
You will bo more assured of graduation if you stand up and 
face problems frankly. You will find everybody appreciates 
sincerity.
,There are probably many ways of reaching your idea of 
success but nono of them can exclude hard work. They are tho 
magic words that mean so much to happiness and that mako 
difiicull; jobs oasy. Lot thoso two words ho your guide through
out collogo.
Our Football Te
Oarnoiyio opoiis its 11.933 gridiron season Saturday in moot
ing Tomplo al; tho Stadium. Not in recent; years has w much 
intercut boon shown over an, inaugural game. Tho fact that 
Temple this year is the opponent 1ms contributed greatly to this 
increased inlioresl;. Always a dangerous rival, Tomplo this year 
prosonts a new head coach in tho person ol! Pop Warner of 
.Pil.l; and Stanford famo and will be out to mako a good iihowing 
:in tho city in which Warner scored some of his groatosl; 
victories.
The Onrnogio team, however, is the factor contributing 
most to the interest in tho game. The Tartans, like Temple, will 
present new coaches this year. Howard Harpstcr and Don 
Lovowell, 1928 Carnegie graduates, are now at tho helm. With 
a, fine coaching record since leaving school, tho two, Harpster 
as head coach and Lovowoll as line instructor, have returned to 
their alma mater and will make their debut in major football 
competition.
As to the team itself, the coaches have indicated satisfac
tion, preferring however to await the Temple test before cast
ing further judgment on their proteges. The squad is small 
for a college of Carnegies size and the coaches have been able 
to form a closely knit combination. The team was in camp 
from Labor Day until the opening of school and spent no little 
time in drilling on fundamentals. Observers sajr that a better 
spirit among the players is in evidence this year than has been 
the case for some time.
It is not likely that the team will win every game but it 
will win its share and may surprise in some awarded already 
on paper to the opponents. We shall be satisfied this year, re
gardless of the score, if the team plays an intelligent brand of 
football and is willing to take a chance now and then. If the 
players show evidence of their training in the fundamentals and 
attention to their blocking, tackling, and interference we shall 
have no complaint.
We shall be satisfied even when the team loses, as it prob
ably will on occasions, if the players have put up a good fight 
and have been in the game all the way. Certainly nothing more 
can be asked. The new coaches must be given a chance to pro
duce the results for which they are striving. We can well af
ford to wait, knowing at least that while were not there, 
at least were on our way.
Student Opinion
Judging by tho amount ol letters roccivod by tho Tartan 
from students it would appear that tho undergraduates have 
forgotten that tho Tartan is their paper and that ono of its 
major functions is to present stud out opinion. Thoro must cer
tainly bo among a group of over 2,000 students many good 
ideas. Send your contribution in.

FROMTHE FENX5B
This pillar belonga primarily to the atudents 
and they ahould therefore, have something to aay 
about what goes Into it. Heretofore it baa been 
cuatomary for the peraon conducting the Fence 
to appoint aids in the various aclioola to help in 
gathering the dirt. This year we thought that it 
n.lght be better to try, for a few weeks anyway, 
to let the students themaelvea contribute happen
ings that they would like to have known. You 
know'Homebody In your department that you 
want to kid, or something that happened in your 
dorm, room or fraternity houae. In this way tho 
column would not just contain the things which 
fall within our own limited scope, and would 
more nearly accomplish its purpose.
In case you do send anything in, please sign it. 
Our waste basket keeps all secrets if the sender 
doeanL wiah his name tp appear but no matter 
how choice anonymous news may bewe can't 
use it. Haven't been in this racket long enough 
to know If the average student takes thia much 
interest in his paper but if there is no response 
it'll be easy enough to keep on writing this in 
tho uauai way.
We're indebted to our old friend, Roy Grant, 
for a report on the Plebe Pajama Parade. Ac
cording to Roy 
it was one of 
the moat aucceaaful in a 
long time. Aa 
usual, the 
scantily - clad 
freshmen were 
led past the 
girls' dorms 
where they were duly doused via pitcher, bucket, 
etc. Then the procession trekked down to Pan
ther Hollow Lake where, watched from above by 
a gleeful gallery of seniors and juniors, the 
sophs proceeded to dutifully bathe the neophytes. 
IJp to this time the Plebes had been meek and 
submissive but the chilling waters seemed to 
arouse their spirits for they turned on their tor
mentors and chased home the ones that they 
werent able to catch and duck.
*****
The future fate of tea dances seems to rest in 
the hands of the male student body. Perhaps it 
was the weather but nevertheless it didnt take 
more than one look to notice that the gentlemen 
of the Institute stayed away from the Mortar 
Board affair in large numbers. At one time there 
were 43 (by actual count) of the subtler sex 
standing off to the side just yearning to be met 
and danced with. Personally, we have neither 
social nor financial interest in tea dances as such, 
but they do offer the best opportunity for the 
undergradutes, especially the new freshmen, to 
get acquainted and that girl whom you wanted 
to meet was probably up in Thistle Hall last week. 
Dont know who is holding the next tea dance or 
when Its to be, but you fellows really ought to 
drop in on ono of these more or less traditional 
affairs if for no other reason than to pass a final 
judgment on their worth while.
*****
Although the actual figures arent available, its 
interesting to note that it costs the Institute be
tween twice and three times as much to send 
you to school for a year as that $300 you gave 
them.
There are only four captains on this year's Xcountry team. Bobby Schell and General Grant

code. It's getting so an instructor is almost 
ashamed to ask the flock to study from a cheap 
$5 book. By the time we get through doing our 
part down in the book store theres nothing left 
in the old sock but a reminder of what used to 
be.
When Scotty so brightly suggested to his P. C. 
W. date the other P. M. that she punch the house 
mother (since they had no time clock), he didnt 
know that the dear lady in question was stand
ing behind the curtain taking it all in.

Took in our annual theatrical lawst week and 
saw several Carnegians in the audience. The 
faces of lone Gaul, Henrietta DeHaven and 
alumnus Ralph Frank (with Virginia Reed, of 
course) come to mind. Across the street in the 
Chatterbox the real Wilderness was in prog
ress as that famous night palace was holding its 
annual opening. Ed McCormick with Dotty Staley 
and Tim McCoy with Sue Fuller were about the 
only Techites who managed to jostle shoulders 
with Pittsburghs elite.

The thing that impressed us most last Saturday 
eve was the fact that we have a very socially in
clined plebe class this year. Ordinarily the Wel
come Freshman Dance is merely the initial gettogether of old friends among the upperclassmen, 
with a scattering of scared but determined plebes 
present. Not so this year for the strange faces 
and new figures which danced to the strains of 
Maestro Ryshanek actually seemed to outnumber 
the old standbys.
Of course all the Drag-ones were therenoth
ing mercenary of course, purely festive. We saw 
Ginny Artz with a new flame named Hupson, or 
something like that. Al Fenderson and Evelyn 
OToole, W. Sylvester Hamilton and Leah 
Voeglitly, Bea Archer and her new beau (Lib 
Lewis), Norm Brown and Marty Demms and 
as usual with 
George Goodridge and Reba 
W a ggoner 
were among 
those distin
guishable from 
the new class.
Joel Haversticlc appeared 
as usual with the charming Peggy Joyce, but 
Jimmy Herrons Miss Scott was a new one on us. 
Johnny Anderson and Jim Hughes also turned up 
with new escorts. Ex-Editor Harry Kolb, exFencer Vinny McBride and ex-President Bill 
Burns represented that great society of alumni 
who just cant stay away.* * * * *
Better arrange your plans so that you can at
tend the big pep rally Friday night because it 
looks from here like big doings. This rally with 
its accompanying program will inaugurate a new 
Tartan traditionto be held each year before the 
first home game. Carnegie spirit at past pre
game celebrations has indeed been a thing of joy 
for the enthusiastic onlooker to behold (Oakland 
booby-liatcli please note) and we wouldnt miss 
this party on Friday niglit for anything. Of 
course the proceedings will be very orderly but 
even so a few fond memories might be stirred. 
See you about 7:30 in the Bowl.

Carnegie Mourns 
Death of Former 
Faculty Member
Carnegie has suffered an irre
parable loss in the death of Mr. Al
fred C. Wingold, instructor in 
Architectural Design, who was 
drowned in a lake at the Grove 
City Country Club on August 14. 
Mr. Wingold was thirty years of 
age at the time. He entered the 
Department of Architecture in 
September, 1922, and graduated 
with honors in June, 1927. In the 
month of his graduation he won 
the competition for the John Stewardson Memorial Scholarship, pro
viding for a years travel and study 
abroad. Returning from abroad 
lie entered the offices of Paul P. 
Cret where he had a part in the 
design of a number of well known 
buildings. He was assistant pro
fessor of Architecture at Oklahoma 
A. & M. College for the year 1929- 
30, and resigned this position to 
become a member of the staff of 
the Department of Architecture at 
Carnegie in September, 1930. Mr. 
Wingold was esteemed by faculty 
and students alike for his excepttional ajbility in his chosen field, 
for his patience and skill as a 
teacher of design, for his unselfish 
and untiring devotion to the inter
ests of the individual students and 
the department as a whole, and for 
his fine character and spirit of good 
fellowship.
