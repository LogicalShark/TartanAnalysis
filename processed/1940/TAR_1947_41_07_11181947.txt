Noted Commentator 
Will A ddress Assem b ly
Martin Agronsky Has Excellent Background 
For Analysis Of Current Potiliccd Affairs
Martin Agronsky will visit the CIT campus on Tuesday, December 
2, when he will be the guest speaker on the Chapel program at 11:30 
a. m. Mr. Agronsky, the well-known correspondent, commentator, 
and author, will speak on the topic The United StatesThe Con
gressAnd The World, in the Little Theatre of the Fine Arts 
building.
Mr. Agronskys experiences as a war correspondent and radio 
commentator give him an excel- ? 
lent background for his analysis 
of current political developments, 
with his present position being 
the culmination of a period of ac
tive reporting! which began in 1936 
in Palestine and continued through 
the Spanish Civil War and World 
War II.
Mr. Agronsky was one of the 
first to report the American naval 
victory of Macassar Straits. He 
scored again with his eye-wit
ness account of General MacArthurs arrival in Australia to 
defend the continent. These accompliments were recognized 
by General Mae Arthur in March,
1945 when he received a citation 
and the Asiatic Pacific Service 
Ribbon. Rutgers University also 
honoured him for fearless and 
searching interpretation of world 
events.
Mr. Agronsky continues his 
reportage and commentaries, now 
turning his attention to the na
tional and international scenes.
At 31, the youngest Washington 
news analyst with a program of 
his own, he has a daily ^oast-tocoast program from 8:00 to 8:15 
a. m. as the Capital correspondent 
of the American Broadcasting Co.
The appearance of Mr. Agron
sky at Carnegie Tech is in line 
with the schools policy of en
couraging various notables to pre
sent their views to the student 
body. *
Present indications show a keen 
interest in Mr. Agronskys ap
pearance here, and a large crowd 
is expected. Seating arrange
ments will be on a first come, first 
served basis. Any overflow will 
be absorbed by Exhibition Hall, 
directly across from the Little 
Theatre.

Public Aid Is Sought 
By Carnegie Institute
Fine Arts And Museum Society Needs Funds 
To Continue Work For First Time In History
The Fine Arts and Museum society of Carnegie Institute is ap
pealing for public aid to continue its work for the first time in its 
51 year history, Mr. William Frew, chairman of the Beard of Trus
tees, has announced.
Low interest rates on the original Carnegie endowment and 
the continued rise in operating costs have created this crisis, Mr. 
Frew explained, and membership dues will be used to supplement 
income from the interest in main- ?
taining and operating these certers of culture and education.
The Fine Arts and Museum de
partments of the Carnegie Insti
tute include the art galleries, the 
Museum, and all shops associated 
with them, including-hobby shops 
and workshops for public use.
Four types of membership will 
be available. Dues run from $2 a 
year for situdent membership to 
$5000 for a life membership, Mr. 
Frew continued.
Alpha Phi Omega, Boy Scout 
service fraternity, is handling the 
Institute subscription campaign 
on the Carnegie Tech campus. The 
drive starts on Monday, November 
24, and there will be a bootfh in 
Skibo with subscription blanks 
available.
Subscribers to the Institute will 
receive a monthly copy of the 
Carnegie Magazine, containing ar
ticles of general interest about the 
work being done by staff mem
bers. Each issue includes at least 
one article about CIT.
All programs sponsored by the 
Institute are free to the general 
public, but members will receive 
advance notice of all meetings, 
which include movies, lectures, 
and art exhibits, as well as pre
ference on tickets.
Institute hops, including a 
well-equipped hobby shop, are 
available to members, with a 
skilled staff for advice on difficult
work. Field trips to points of sci
entific interest, as well as nature 
hikes, are sponsored by the so
ciety at frequent intervals.
The C&rnegie Institute is pre
vented by its charter from charg
ing for any services which it per
forms for the general public.
Speaking on The State of CIT in his annual address 
to the student body, Dr. Robert E. Doherty will keynote the 
Carnegie Day exercises to be held at 11:00 a. m., November 25 
in the Carnegie Music Hall.
In discussing the exercises, Faculty Marshall H. K. KirkPatrick explained: The idea is to have a convocation of all
the students from the different colleges, and to honor those
students who have distinguished themselves in scholarship.
? It is, further, an opportunity 
for the president to meet with the 
students and to discuss with them 
the plans being made for the fu
ture of CIT.
The new music composed for 
the Alma Mater by Mr. Roland
J. Leich, professor of musical
theory and composition, will be 
played by the student orchestra 
under the direction of Dr. Fred
erick Dorian in the first public 
presentation of this work.
If the weather is fair, the tra
ditional march to the Music hall 
will be led by the Kiltie Band, 
followed by the ROTC detach
ment, scholarship holders, and the 
general student body. Inclement 
weather will, however, cause the 
march to be omitted.
As the school is endeavoring to 
make Carnegie Day comparable 
in part to the tap days of the Ivy 
League, the scholastic honoraries Tau Beta Pi and Theta Tau 
will make their calls, which will 
be secret until the time for tap
ping actually arrives.
Estelle Mattes, president of Mor
tar Board, will present an award 
to the outstanding freshman worn* 
an scholar of the 1946-1947 aca
demic year. Fraternity, sorority 
and womens dormitory scholar
ship cups will also be awarded.

tion in the students own com[Continued on page 81

The tentative schedule for the 
week is set up as follows: Tues
day, Margaret Morrison; Wednes

day, Engineering students. Dur
ing these days, X-rays will be 
given from 9:00 a. m. to 1:00 p 
m., and 2:00 p. m. to 5:00 p. m.; 
on Saturdays, from 9:00 a. m. to 
12:00 a. m. Those students who 
find it impossible to go to the gym 
on their scheduled day may re
port at any time during the week.
Math Club Will Be Installed 
As Chapter Of Pi Mu Epsilon
The Mathematics club of CIT will be installed as Pennsylvania 
Epsilon chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, national mathematics honorary 
fraternity, on Thursday, November 20. Formal installation will be 
preceded by a banquet at the University club.
The Mathematics club was originally organized in October, 
1938, by a group of students in Professor Rosenbachs higher alge
bra course, which has been a seething hotbed of mathematical 
disputes for over twenty years. ?
The tireless professor was, of 
course, the clubs first advisor,
a position which he still holds.
The purpose ot the club was 
to foster interest in mathematics 
throughout the entire school. 
Monthly meetings were held, at 
which the student members pre
sented elementary problems from 
an advanced point of view and 
advanced problems from an ele
mentary point of view. Eihphasis 
was placed on subjects which 
would not ordinarily be covered 
in formal courses.
The war years were lean ones 
for the club but it managed to 
survive, largely because of Pro
fessor Rosenbachs efforts. With 
the math department now expand
ed to many times its pre-war size, 
the club is thriving as never be
fore, and its meetings are always 
thronged. Because of the clubs 
firm foundations and the high 
standards of the mathematics de
partment at Carnegie, the national 
honorary accepted the clubs peti
tion for a charter this spring. The

Editorial
About Carnegie Day
Carnegie Day is on the calendar for 
11:00 a. m. Tuesday, November 25.
The program prepared for this convocation 
is a good one, with tapping for honoraries, pre
sentation for the first time of new music for 
the Alma Mater, and the announcement of 
many important awards having been scheduled.
President Dohertys speech, the main event 
of the exercises, has been planned to fit the 
specific interests of the student body. Its sub
ject, The State of CIT, was suggested by the 
Student Conference committee as the topic in 
which students would be most interestedwhat 
is being done now to improve the school and 
its activities, and what is planned for the fu
ture.
This event will also provide the only chance 
w'hich most of us will have during the year to 
meet writh the president.
But if this program is to be so interesting, 
then why must it be mentioned in the editorial 
column ?
Why Carnegie Day in the Editorial?
Because the editorial column suspects that 
beyond the band, ROTC detachment, and the 
scholarship holders and potential receivers of 
awards, attendance at Carnegie Day will be 
incomplete. v
And yet ask a student what a good remedy 
for poor school spirit might be, and his answer 
is often: Build a big auditorium in which the 
entire school can gather for graduations and 
other big exercises.
Forgetting for a moment that the Little 
Theater is often cavernous with respect to the 
number of people who attend the present as
semblies, the construction of a major audit
orium on campus is impractical for the present.
In the meantime, the school is doing its 
best to fill this need by using the Music hall 
as an occasional substitute, presenting pro
grams whose contents have been requested in 
part by the students themselves.
Attendance Is Important
If there is to be any feeling of oneness 
with Carnegie Tech, then attendance at these 
all-school programs is important. That this at
tendance has been unsatisfactory in the past 
is no reason for keeping it so in the present 
or the future.
We are being given a chance to build up 
a real unity among our three diverse colleges 
and cores of carefully segregated departments. 
Taking this chance appears to be much in our 
own interest, and much in the interest of build
ing up an atmosphere at CIT which will be a 
stimulating combination of our normal aca
demic iutentness and the evanescent under
graduate spirit traditionally associated with 
an American college.

noblest gesture
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
Last week in Karachi, India, a woman died of 
wounds inflicted upon her in a riota woman who 
had piteously and heroically endured the famine, 
misery, and persecution which is the lot of her 
people, to live out her fifty years of suffering. An 
attendant threw a sheet over the 
corpse arjd it was trundled off to a 
common pit.
On the Acropolis in Athens last 
week sixteen men and women 
were executed as traitors to the 
Greek government. Never mind 
what their politics were, the im
portant thing is this: They were 
willing to give their lives for the 
sake of a principle; and such sac
rifice is commonly deemed the 
a human being may make. Only 
a mildly interested photographer bothered to view 
the proceedings.
But in Kentucky last week a bugler sounded 
taps while a throng stood with bowed heads. At 
racetracks throughout the country flags were low
ered and a minute of silence was observed. For 
they were burying Man o War, a horse with a 
good set of legs, with such pomp and ceremony as 
is accorded few human beings.
The cynic will say Why shouldnt they? After 
all, a good horse is more valuable than the aver
age human being. A sociologist will dispose of 
this incident as the inevitable result of commer
cialized gambling. But I heard, a comment more 
telling than these twothat although there may 
be some in other lands who will scoff at the idea 
of paying homage to a horse, we in America believe 
in honoring those who are good, and Man o War 
was the best of his kind; and that such admiration 
is one thing that makes this country great.
This betrays one of the most flagrant Ameri
can provincialisms, one that is justifiably losing for
eign friends for us, and that is creating plenty 
of disgust in this country toothe idea of identi
fying the by-products of our life as essential ele
ments of Americanism.
Since when must one pay homage to Man o War 
to be a good American? Where does it say in the 
Constitution that I must admire a horses ligaments 
and tendons to be a good, citizen? Is it not rather 
the part of a good American citizen to develop 
in himself that sympathy for human life and wel
fare which will place the tragic death of a woman

Says I!
By Robert Charpie
[This is the first appearance of Mr. Charpies 
column, which is being included in the Tartan 
in order to maintain a balance between conflicting 
political opinions. Like Says Who?, it does not 
necessarily represent the opinion of the Tartan 
Editorial Board.Ed.]
One of the announced purposes of the current 
special session of Congress is to do something about 
the rising cost of living. Many short-sighted indiv
iduals hope that the administration Will request 
and obtain the return of price ceilings.
I think the re-institution of controls would be 
the worst possible mistake that the country could 
make at this time. It is certainly true that $90 a 
month doesnt make much of an impression on 
household expenses; nevertheless, in the long run, 
price controls will hurt the economy more than 
will present-day runaway prices.
Economists are agreed that the critical factor 
in the national standard of living is the mainte
nance of the level of total investment. There is 
a definite amount of investment associated with 
any given level of real income, and unless this in
vestment is maintained the standard of living must 
faU.
At first glance we would naively expect price 
fixing to mean increased consumption. This can
not be so, since we are already consuming every
thing which our labor force, fully employed, can 
produce. Therefore, controls can only mean in
creased savings.
It is axiomatic in- money-flow theory that total 
investment over a given period must equal sav
ings over the same period to maintain a given in
come level. Therefore price fixing, and its com
panionate increased savings, must call forth addi
tional investment or our national real income will 
drop. At the same time there would be many fac
tors which are definitely not conducive to risky 
private investment. Union pressure for higher wages 
and shorter hours, double taxation of business

On Stage
By Marty Dorff
I ventured to comment caustic
ally on the drama departments 
choice of certain plays last spring. 
I was later informed through devi
ous channels that the department* 
selection is based on considera
tions which are unfamiliar to out
siders, specifically me, and that ? 
should therefore have kept quiet.
To a large extent the point is 
well-taken. After all, the drama 
departments function is not to en 
tertain the rest of the school, but 
to develop the dramatic poten
tialities of its students. As such, 
it must present plays which pose 
special problems, or illustrate cer
tain points, or give scope to sit
uations which the actors must 
learn to face, whether or not this 
amuses the audience. This position 
would certainly justify the pro
duction of unpopular plays of 
some intrinsic merit.
On the other hand, I cant see 
that this position justifies the pro 
duction in the Little Theater of 
a puerile sterile piece of trash like 
Secret Service. If the purpose of 
producing it were solely didactic, 
then the piece would presumably 
have been done in the studio thea
ter; the fact that it was given a 
long run in the Little Theater 
seems to indicate that someone 
thought it worthy of resuscitation 
in its own right.
That someone was very much 
mistaken. It is unnecessary to 
dwell on absurdities which must 
have been evident to anyone ad
vanced beyond the comic-book 
stage. Even the naive audience 
which usually frequents the plays 
was roused to laughter by the
absolutely ridiculous plot and by 
a denouement which dragged it
self out for the better part of two 
acts. The only compensations were 
the beauty of the costumes and 
the charm of the Varney draw
ing room. It is very disappointing 
to see the considerable talents and 
efforts of the department wasted 
on productions such as the last few 
have been. Surely there must be 
good plays that offer the special 
opportunities that the department 
seeks.
I saw only the first cast. I felt 
that the actors made the best of 
a bad job. George Williams was 
especially successful in portray
ing the unsmiling dignity and 
naive charm of the adolescent Wilfred. His scenes with the volatile 
Caroline, played to the hilt by 
Sada Thomson, were about the 
only part of the show worth see
ing. Louis Edmonds turned in a suave and finished performance as 
Captain Thome. Renee Orkin 
made a vSliant attempt as the con
fused Edith Varney, but the pari 
was simply too incredible for sym
pathetic belief.
The remaining members of the 
cast did a competent job in an 
incompetent play. The dialect 
problem proved a stumbling block 
on the whole, however: some of 
the characters spoke consistently 
in Southern dialect; others lapsed 
in andi out of dialect sporadically; 
still others would promptly have 
been shot as Union spies.
I think it would be best to con
clude this painful subject with a 
pious hope for better things in 
the future.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Student Council Motion 
Increases WCIT Budget
Extensive Transfer of Funds Dominates Talk, 
As Hidden Reserves Are Put Back to Work
Carnival Head 
Selects Nine 
For Committee
Transferring $400 to the account of WCIT, campus radio sta
tion, Student Council conducted its shortest meeting of the year on 
Thursday, November 13, with financial matters dominating the dis
cussion. In the absence of George Marshall J. K. OHare presided.
WCIT received its appropriation in a package motion intro
duced by budget chairman Arthur Naylor.
Included in the motion were the transference of funds from the 
accounts of Inter-Honorary council, King of Hearts dance commit
tee, and the Bard to the general reserve fund of Student Council; 
the donation of the profits from last years Junior Prom and the 
war-time Company B dance to the Student Council grant-in-aid
fund; and' the rescinding, pending* 
further investigation, of the pre
vious weeks motion to pay the 
dues for the National Student 
Association.
The only objections raised were 
to the proposed disposal of InterHonorary funds. That clause was 
removed from the motion and the 
remainder was approved. The re
sult was an increase in the Stu
dent Council general reserve of 
$200.
IH Funds Held
The Inter-Honorary clause was 
dropped when Negley Reed point
ed out that the money should re
vert to the organizations which 
had contributed to Inter-Honorary 
Council. Naylor said he would 
give the matter further study.
The National Student Associa
tion was discussed in connection 
with the use of that organizations 
name in the Campus Progressive, 
official publication of Young Pro
gressive Citizens of America. Nor
man Larsen, regional chairman of 
the NSA said he was seeking an 
explanation.
David Mintz reported that the 
work of the School Spirit commit
tee is coming along very well and 
will be able to dissolve very short
ly. The award of a silver key to 
Bennard Perlman for two years 
work on the Tartan was approved 
by Counc^.
The approval of Council was al
so given to the Margaret Morrison 
Senate to hold an election of 
freshman officers on Tuesday, De
cember 2, and to the Kiltie Band 
to sell 1948 Carnegie Tech picture 
calendars on campus and to re
tain the profits for their organiza
tion.
ODK to Publish Regulations
ODK was granted permission to 
publish a book of regulations for 
the guidance of campus organiza
tions.
During old business, council
man Shapiro reported that he had 
investigated the matter of obtain
ing passes to athletic events for 
the wives of students holding ac
tivities cards. He informed coun
cil that the Athletic Office felt that 
the price of tickets had been sub
stantially lowered, but that*the of
fice was still, open to further sug
gestions concerning this matter.
After Citcom Cian was given 
permission to use some of the 
Student Council permanent deco
rations for their dance on Novem
ber 15, and a short discussion was 
held on the election of class pres
idents, the meeting was adjourned
at 7:45 jp. m. Michael YaJiitor
In preparation for Spring Car
nival weekend, Wilton Hawkins, 
general chairman, has named 
nine engineers to serve on the 
Spring Carnival committee.
Jack Seward has been appointed 
to take care of the budget. Dale 
Wright is in charge of call day 
and coronation; Ivan Faigan, or
chestra and dance; Larry Johnson, 
midway; Allan Yorkin, publicity; 
Bill Bourke, tickets; Ted Ulrich, 
program; and Phil Birnbaum, par
ade.
The Scotch and Soda show, two 
name band dances, and a colorful 
midway will be features of the 
big weekend.
Though most of the members 
of the general committee have 
been chosen, there are still sev
eral vacancies. Hawkins has put 
out a call for those interested in 
heading Decorations, Sweepstakes, 
Canoe Tilt, and Concessions. 
Workers to serve under the gen
eral committee are needed.
All interested in developing the 
1948 Spring Carnival should con
tact Hawkins personally or send 
a letter to Box 394, Interschool 
mail.

and financed by the students, al
umni and friends of Carnegie 
Tech. This memorial will be a 
symbol of the living spirit which 
A1 instilled in all the students 
who knew him.
A1 was a faithful supporter of 
the Tartan teams and could al
ways be persuaded to lead his 
famous Institute cheer. Despite 
the gloomy situation in many of 
CLTs 1946 games, A1 always 
managed to bring out a great re
sponse from the spectators. His 
cheer was always climaxed with 
a somers|ault on the final rah, 
even when the field was muddy. 
A1 collapsed after he had given 
his famous cheer at the 1946 Case 
football game and never regained 
consciousness.

All Students Welcome
Michael A. Yanitor, a junior in 
the department of civil engineer
ing, died Wednesday, November 
12, as a result of injuries suffered 
three days earlier in an accident 
near Warren, Ohio.
The pick-up truck he was driv
ing skidded into a fire plug and 
overturned, pinning him in the 
cab, and killing his companion, 
Miss Christine Scettino, instant
ly. The crash occurred as they re
turned to Warren, after the Carnegie-Case game. Both were resi
dents of that city.
Mickey, 23 at the time of his 
death, was graduated in January 
1943, from the Warren G. Hard
ing high school in Warren, where 
he was class treasurer and a 
member of the Honor society.
Shortly after graduating, he en
listed in the Naval Air corps and 
served in New Guinea for a year 
as a radio operator. Before the 
war ended, he had qualified for 
officer training, completing one 
year under this program.
Entering Carnegie Tech in Feb
ruary 1946, he joined Sigma Al
pha Epsilon fraternity, later serv
ing as its King of Hearts candi
date, and as social chairman. Last 
year he was a member of the var
sity football squad.
The funeral service, held at 10 
a. m. Saturday, November 15, at 
the St. James church in Warren, 
was attended by many of his 
Carnegie Tech friends.
Homecoming festivities are over, and their consequences are 
beginning to fade. But the week-end which began on Friday, No
vember 14, will long be remembered for the number and variety of 
the activities cf which it was composed.
It all began on Friday night, with a pep rally held on the Cut. 
Coach Donohoe and C. B. Groomes, captain for the Lehigh game, 
gave short fight talks and the cheerleaders led the assembled stu
dents in a group of cheers. Then there was a general retirement 
to fraternity house parties.
The alumni luncheon was held at Skibo on Saturday; and, despite 
the cold drizzling rain, a large group of the alumni and the students
* attended the Carnegie-Lehigh 
game.
Before the game the Bagpipers 
of the Kiltie Band played while 
two Scottish lassies did the Sword 
Dance of Victory. Following this 
was a Scottish dance by the cheer 
leaders and several members of 
the band.
The performances of the cheer 
leaders and the bands, although 
inconvenienced by a muddy field, 
were excellent. The seventy-three 
piece Lehigh band, in their brown 
and white uniforms, formed 
Howdy and an anchor. They 
ended the presentation with their 
alma mater. The Kilties formed 
Hello, Home Come, 25, 
and their new double diamond 
formation with an L in the cen
ter. Next they formed an old 
favorite, the Scottie dog, while 
Angus McTavish, CITs new mas
cot, raced up and down the field.
The ATOs won the first prize for their homecoming decoraATO House
Wickwire Wins 
Apell Award
The Norman Apell Scholarship 
Award, given annually to the 
most deserving senior drama stu
dent, was presented last Tues
day, November 11 to Miss Nancy 
Wickwire. The award, amounting 
to $200, was founded in 1945 by 
Mr. and Mrs. Norman Apell in 
the memory of their son, Sgt. Nor
man Apell, a former drama stu
dent who was killed over France 
while serving in the USAF.

described the purpose of the 
prize as A reward to the senior 
who in the opinion of the faculty 
has displayed not only talent and 
ability but also a willingness to 
work and cooperate.
Miss Wickwire has done con
siderable work both inside and 
out of Carnegie Tech. She has 
been active in summer and com
munity theatre work and has ap

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1947
Pash Memorial Trophy 
Will be Awarded Dec. 6
Squad, Coaching Staff To Vote For Recipient; 
Presentation W ill Be Made At Junior Prom
The second annual presentation of the Joe Pash memorial trophywili follow the completion of the present season. The initial recipient 
of the trophy was Ben Backlarz, 47, a stalwart in the line, and 
captain of last years team.
The award is made on the basis of a vote by the football squad 
and the coaching staff. As suggested by the title the trophy is pre
sented by Phi Kappa fraternity as a memorial to their fraternity 
brother, Joseph S. Pash. ?
Joe Pash graduated with a de
gree in Mechanical Engineering 
in December 1942, and entered 
active duty with the Navy in 
February 1943. He served as a 
Lieutenant (j.g.) USNR aboard the 
submarine Lagarto. The La gar to 
was reported overdue after set
ting out for the Tokyo area, and 
all aboard her were declared miss
ing in action.
This disaster brought to an end 
the career of one of the hardest 
fighting footballers who ever wrore 
the colors of Carnegie Tech.
One of the Fastest
One. of his coaches, Walter 
Bums, said of Joe, One of the 
fastest players we ever had on 
the varsity football squad, who 
never asked quarter even though 
he weighed only 155 pounds.
Joe was a little guy playing in 
the days when Carnegie had big 
football squads, but he never let 
the size of his opponents slow his 
fight and determination. Everyone 
who had seen Joe play, those who 
were on the squad with him, all 
were impressed by the fight the 
little guy showed when on the 
gridiron.
He was a football player when 
CIT carried to the gridiron the 
tradition of coming through at 
least once a year with a major 
upset. It is a widely known fact 
that no team, no matter how 
much the odds were in their favor, 
could ever be sure of an easy 
game against the Tartans.
Tradition Produces Big Upset
This tradition produced what is 
considered to be one of the major 
upsets in all football history his
tory when, in 1926, the Tartans 
defeated the Irish of Notre Dame.
That was the day that the famed 
Knute Rockne was so confident of 
victory that he was attending the 
game in Chicago scouting the one 
team that was given a chance to 
beat the Irish that year. The Tar
tans won that game.
The trophy that commemorates 
the spirit of Joe Pash will be pre
sented at the Junior Prom on 
Saturday, December 6. In addition 
to the trophy awarded there will 
be placed on public display a per
manent trophy upon which will be 
inscribed the names of the annual 
recipients.
Grove City 
Picked To Win
Visitors Seek Sixth 
After Losing Opener
The Grove City college Grov
ers will travel to Pittsburgh on 
Saturday, November 22, to meet 
the Tartans at Forbes field, bring
ing with them a five game win
ning streak.
On the basis of the seasons play 
they are rated as favorites by 
several touchdowns.
After losing to Geneva in their 
opening contest, the Grovers came 
back strong to defeat Hiram, Alle
gheny, Slippery Rock, Thiel, and 
Westminster in succession. At 
present they are rolling in high 
gear and are out to end the sea
son with a decisive win over Car
negie.
The red and white are coached 
by James Loveless who uses the 
T-formation. His squad is a high 
scoring aggregation that has 
crossed enemy goal lines at the 
rate of about four touchdowns 
per game. The important thing is 
that they have been improving in 
each game.
This contest is important for 
the Tartans since it is their last 
chance to score a win this season. 
The Plaid will be in good physical 
shape with the exception of Floyd 
Wiseman, who dislocated an elbow 
against Lehigh.

cluded eight members: Robert
Charpie, Richard Eschenbach, 
Paul Zweifel, John Loucks, Rich
ard Armstrong, William Perkins, 
William Miller, and Herbert Herz.
Last years tournament, with 
1,008 students representing 126 
colleges in 39 states, was won by 
the team from the University of 
California.
Only undergraduates are eligi
ble to play in the duplicate Con
tract Bridge event for the title 
and trophy.
Carnegie Techs soccer team 
suffered its fourth defeat of the 
season at the hands of Oberlin 
by a score of 3-0 in a sea of mud 
on the Skibo field last Saturday.
The defeat was the worst the 
Tartans have suffered this year 
and came at the hands of tfye 
strongest team in this district. The 
game was slowed down by the 
layer of mud that blanketed the 
field. The ball became heavy from 
the wet grounds and just slithered 
through the upper layer of mud, 
making it practically impossible to 
control.
The Tartans managed to hold 
the visitors scoreless during the 
first quarter and half of the sec
ond. But the smooth passing Ober
lin team capitalized on a Tartan 
defensive lapse midway in the 
second period to tally their first 
goaL
The second goal came shortly 
after on a penalty kick. Clinton, 
Carnegies substitute goalie, made 
an attempt to stop the ball and 
managed to get his fingertips on 
it. On a dry day he might have 
been able to stop it, but the ball 
was so wet and sloppy that it 
glanced off his fingers and went 
through the goal posts.
The Skibos had a golden scor
ing opportunity in the third per
iod when Abraham was awarded 
a penalty kick but he failed to 
convert it. The final Oberlin score 
came just before the final whistle 
blew.
Next Saturday the Skibos will 
play host to Grove City in the 
final game of the year. The contest 
will be played on the FPHA soc
cer field.
As the date of the first basket
ball game draws nearer, assist
ant coach Mel Cratsley continues 
to work his charges hard every 
day. Calisthentics followed by 
long and strenuous scrimmages 
are usually the order of the day 
as Ml attempts to iron out the 
squads rough spots before the 
return of head coach Bill Dono
hue.
This is the first time in sev
eral years that the basketball team 
has been able to get such a good 
start before the season. If Mel 
has it his way, he will have a 
well-conditioned squad on hand 
when Coach Donohue takes over 
following the final football game 
with Grove City.
Although there has been no at
tempt made to pick a starting five 
yet, it appears that Theodore, 
Katselas, Matsey, Riehl, Chetlin, 
McCullough, Dunn, Hannum, and 
Johe have the inside track on first 
team assignments. All have been 
showing good team work and 
Theodore, Matsey, and McCul
lough have shown plenty of scor
ing punch in recent practices. This 
is one item that was sorely lack
ing in last years quintet.
This years squad will probably 
have to rely on speed to offset 
their opponents height as it is 
expected that they will enter most 
of their games with a distinct dis
advantage in height.
The spirit that the squad has 
been displaying in their practice 
sessions has been very encourag
ing to everyone looking forward 
to a successful season.
This week the squad will have
its first taste of actual competi
tion when they scrimmage against 
an organized team of campus 
players on Tuesday and Thurs
day.
After relinquishing his duties to 
Coach Donohue, Cratsley will take 
over his duties as JV mentor. All 
those interested in playing are 
urged to report when the notice 
for candidates is posted.
The Carnegie Tech Tartans 
lost their thirteenth consecutive 
football game last Saturday by 
a 27-2 score as the Lehigh En
gineers put on a second half 
drive to overpower them on 
wet turf of Forbes field.
The fourth quarter saw the 
brown and white cross the goal 
line three times, the weary 
Tartans being unable to stop 
them or start any scoring drives 
of their own. This display of 
Lehigh power came after the smaller Tartans had held them scoreless in the first half while hanging onto a two point lead.
For the second consecutive 
weekend the Tartans entered the 
second half of a football game 
with the advantage in score, only 
to lose it and eventually lose the 
game. The third quarter was al
most a direct parallel of the Case 
game as Lehigh came back to 
score on the third play, going for 
50 yards and a touchdown.
The backfield play of Lehigh 
was the outstanding part of the 
game. Running from a T-forma
tion, they were fast and decep
tive and knew how to drive 
through a hole. Berdan was the 
outstanding player, gaining ground 
every time he carried the ball.
The other Engineer backs pro
vided a varied attack. Fisher, 
Walters, Kuhar, and Navarre car
ried the ball while Kress and 
Spanella passed with great ac
curacy.
The 3000 fans Who attended the 
game were treated to an outstand
ing punting duel between little 
Jerry Helland of Carnegie and 
tall Joe Bast of Lehigh. Both got 
off long, high punts. Bast edged

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1047THE CARNEGIE TARTAN6
Creguts Sports Scope
66One Play Can Wreck Season; 
Little Things Upset Forecasts
Some time ago we verL^ured the 
opinion that if 
Carnegies foot
ball team could 
get by its first 
three games, 
which then ap
peared to be the 
toughest, with
out any great 
losses in man
power or spirit, 
it might go on to
Pete Cregut win a game or 
two before the end of the season.
In the light of what happened 
last Saturday, it might appear 
that making such a prediction was 
foolhardy, but actually we dont 
think it is as far fetched as it 
might appear.
Throughout the West Virginia, 
Geneva, and Washington and Jef
ferson games the squad knew 
they were going to have a hard 
time but they approached each 
'game with the conviction that 
they were going to prove to those 
teams that they werent going to 
have as easy a contest asr they ex
pected.
They improved each week, 
making fewer and fewer mistakes. 
The climax came at W&J when 
they came back with two touch
downs in the second half to make 
a close game of what at first ap
peared to be a rout For the Case 
game the squad was at full 
strength for the first time since 
the first game of the season. Ev
ery man was convinced that they 
were going to finally win one. The 
student body, too, was permeated 
by this spirit as was attested by 
the large number that made the 
trip to Cleveland to sit in on what
appeared to be a history-making 
game.
What happened up by Lake Erie 
changed the entire picture. If 
there ever was a game we should 
have won, the Case game was it. 
No doubt you have all heard 
about the penalty that set up the 
winning touchdown for the Cleve
landers  the interference called 
by an official on the other side of 
the field from the play. That was 
the play that wrecked the season.
After the game a lot of pessi
mism began to come over the 
squad for the first time this sea
son. It began to appear that the 
team was resigned to another winless year. The talk of upsetting 
Carnegies heavily favored op
ponents on any particular Satur
day suddenly disappeared. That 
was the blow to the spirit that we 
had mentioned earlier in the sea
son.
Last Saturdays loss to Lehigh, 
however, cant be blamed on 
weakness of the spirit. It must be 
attributed to the fact that the vis
itors had the better team. They 
were big and they had three men 
who could buck the line as well 
as any we have seen all season. 
It is a tribute to the Tartan line 
and to the play of Groomes in 
backing up the line that Lehigh 
had to give up running attempts 
and take to the air for its first 
touchdown.
The game this coming Saturday 
should find the Skibos again out
classed. Grove City has been im
proving steadily each week, reach
ing their peak last week as they 
trampled Westminster 24-0. Gen
eva beat Carnegie 40-12, but could 
only down Grove City 26-0, indi
cating a definite edge for the Tar
tans last opponent of the year.

After a final week of rugged 
football, the TXs and Tau Delts 
emerged as winners in the Na
tional and Federal leagues respec
tively. The American league title 
is still undebided with the Kappa 
Sigs and Citcom deadlocked.
The TXs'completed their 
schedule undefeated by taking a 
close one from the Phi Kaps, 19- 
14. The TXs started fast as Nels 
Greene lugged the pigskin over 
the double stripe for one touch
down and passed to Frankie 
Lee for two more. With the score 
18-1 against them, the Phi Kaps 
put on a rally that fell just one 
touchdown short. Jack Collins 
tossed passes to Varan and Stroble who scored for Phi Kappa.
Tau Delta Phi proved them
selves to be the class of the Fed
eral league when they took an 
early lead and held it throughout 
to defeat the Sigma Nus 11-5. 
Sherm Cohen, passer deluxe, 
threw two bullet passes that Stan 
Smith gathered in for Tau Delt 
touchdowns. Sigma Nu scored in 
the third quarter when Bill Hei 
denriech pissed to Pete Cregut.
The American league cham
pionship is undecided as a result 
of a 7-7 tie score in the Kappa 
Sig-Citcom tilt The Kappa Sigs 
tallied in the first quarter when 
Ludwig skirted right end from the 
one yard line. They held their 
lead until late in the third quar

RuggedFloyd Wiseman 
Made the Grade Early
It is an exception when a man can make the team, let alone 
get into a game during his freshman year, was an expression quoted 
many times last season by Coach Donahoe.
This year, rugged Floyd Wiseman, Tartan right guard, has proved 
the exception to the rule. Floyd has started in every game this 
year, and has played nearly 60 minutes in each. Bulling his way 
through opposing lines has caused Floyd no small amount of trouble.
------------------------------------------------------?He limped off the field during the
game against Wesleyan, was 
helped off the field by teammates 
in the Geneva fracas, and finally 
was carried from the field at 
Washington, Pa.
This ungraceful exit from the 
gridiron in the closing minutes of 
each contest does not indicate that 
Floyd is brittle. A cramp in his 
leg caused his departure in each 
' of the first two games, while a 
knockout punch by an offside line
man sent him along the now 
familiar path to the sidelines, in 
the third.
The wearer of jersey number 
31 is 18 years old, 5 ft. 8 in. 
tall and weighs 180 pounds. He 
is attending Carnegie under th 
Navy V-5 program and, after two 
years of school he will leave for 
fight training. Floyd, who is a 
first semester freshman in the me
chanical engineering department, 
is pledged to Sigma Nu fraternity.
Prior to entering CIT, Floyd 
played high school football at 
Turtle Creek for one year and |gt 
Monessen for two more. While In 
his senior year, he was chosen fr 
several all-star teams: the Mon 
Valley first team; the all West
moreland County second team; 
and the all-state class AA WPIAL 
honorable mention iist.
Floyd is used to playing a hard 
and rugged game of ball. While 
in high school he opposed men 
like W&Js Dan Towler and Pitts 
Bimbo Ceccone. His team was 
quite successful, winning eight out 
of ten games and defeating 
Donoras WPIAL champions for 
the first time in 20 games.
Floyd has been working hard, 
along with Maxton, Shapiro and 
Madden, to strengthen the Plftid 
line. Every week he has forged 
into the opposing teams babkfield time after time, causing 
many observers to rate him 
among the best guards in the dis
trict
While performing against Le
high last week he gave another 
good account of himself, but ihe 
old injury jinx struck again. In 
the last period Floyd lunged at 
a speedy Engineer back as he dart
ed through the line and the impact 
was enough to dislocate his elbow. 
It is hoped that the injury will 
respond well enough to treat
ment so that he will be able to 
play in the Grove City game.

end zone. The fourth quarter 
proved scoreless, so the game will 
have to be replayed before the 
American league champion is de
termined. ,
The Beta Sigs took it on the 
chin from the Phi Kaps, 15-8, as 
the Phi Kaps scored in the last 
period to break an 8-8 time. In 
their next game the Phi Kaps fell 
before the ATOs 18-6. Connie 
Hammann pulled down passes 
from Bob Cywinski for two of the 
ATO scores. The third came on a 
long run by Wayne Ash bee. Phi 
Kappa scored late in the game on 
a long pass from Collins to Varan.
In another game during the 
week, the ATOs ran up the big
gest score of the past few years 
when they defeated the Graduate 
Physicists 41-3. The seven ATO 
touchdowns were made as follows: 
Larson  two on passes from 
Schier and one on a pass from 
Cywinski; Schierone on a 60 
yard return of a kickoff and one 
on a pass from Cywinski; Ashbee 
one on a pass from Schier; 
Cywinskione on a pass from 
Schier. Albright tabbed a Physi 
cist in the end zone for an ATO 
safety.
The SAEs dropped one to Sig

The Carnegie Tech Cross Country season c'osed with an impress
ive 24 to 31 win over a favored Slippery Rock team last Friday 
on the Schenley Park course. The victory was the second for the 
Tartans against as many defeats.
Ivor Davies and Bill Johnson covered the four and one-half 
mile run in the fast time of 25:50, finishing far in front of Bob 
Hyde of Slippery Rock. Gene Cockrell placed fourth with a 27:10 time 
and was followed by the visitors ?
Jim Elias and Irwin Hess. It was, 
however, Fred Price, a freshman, 
who clinched the Tartan victory 
with a time of 28:12 in seventh 
place ahead of Slippery Rocks 
Olesen and Doerr. Ed Shoemaker, 
who was hampered by a bad 
ankle injured earlier in the sea
son, copped the tenth spot to com
plete the scoring. Bill Kearns took 
eleventh for Carnegie, while Bofc 
Herbert finished thirteenth.
In their only other home en

Geneva Covenanters by a 26-29 
score on October 25. Davies paced 
the local runners to the finish In 
second place with a time of 26:

A strong Westminster squad, 
stopped only once all season and 
then by Pitts Panthers, handed 
the locals their first set-back at

---------------------------------------------------

Business-likewhat a clear characterization of George Mar
shall!
This term certainly conveys the essence of the man, but it is 
still an inadequate description of one whose achievements while a 
senior in the department of mechanical engineering have been made 
under pressure of the additional responsibilities of being a husband 
and the leading administrator of campus activities.
In keeping with his assigned 
role as the executive type, George 
looks the part. His customary 
white shirt and dark suit set off 
fair-skinned Nordic leanness. 
Blonde hair, long and thick, 
sweeps away from his narrow an
gular forehead and more angular 
nose. Sharpness of feature is the 
overall keynote.
One conception generally held 
of the eager executive type, that of 
>erpetual hustle, seems to be miss
ing from the Marshall make-up. 
George appears to be eternally 
composed. Contributive to the im
plied air of detachment are tracer 
of slouch and shuffle, handu 
plunged into pants pockets, anc' 
a deliberately poised cigarette.
One giveaway for the Marshal 
eagerness, so evident from his rec
ord and' so belied by his manner 
isms, is the eye contact he main
tains. Dramatically deep-set and 
'ong-lashed, the Marshall eyes 
give evidence of the complete at
tention that George extends tc 
hose with whom he is talking. 
Further evidence may be found in 
the low-pitched voice, always 
somewhat subdued as if in court
esy. His intonation is such that il 
placates while his words may be 
questioning a point or exclaiming 
a reaction.
While distinctly an asset from s 
diplomatic point of view, an air oi 
ietachment earns adverse criticism 
also. It can be easily misconstrued 
as aloofness. When that happens, 
and unhappily it does happen, all
George Marshall
the brilliant hues of a notable rec
ord of achievement suffer discolor
ation. It can only be suggested 
that, in the case of George Mar
shall, the plaintiffs investigate the 
possibility that any apparent res
ervation or constraint might be 
strictly mannerism and actually 
a front for manifest vitality.
Budgets
All organizations are urged 
to pick up their respective 
budgets from Dean Davids of
fice immediately.

out Helland with an average of 
39 yards to Jerrys 36. This was 
quite a feat for Jerry since Bast 
is rated second best in the nation.
The Tartans downfall was par
tially due to insufficient weight, 
but their inability to complete any 
passes was their greatest deficien
cy. They were forced to resort to 
a running game that made their 
backs mince-meat for the Lehigh 
line. Carnegie attempted 13 pass
es of which nine were incomplete 
and four were intercepted.
The Tartans scored first in the 
opening period. After driving 
downfleld, they elected to pass 
Maleys aerial into the end zone 
was intercepted by Heck, whc 
lateraled to Walters. Madden ther 
pulled Walters down in the end 
zone to give the Tartans their only 
score.
The Engineers came back 
strongly in the third quarter as 
Kuhar passed to Sprang for a 
touchdown. Jones kick was good 
and the brown and white led by 
a 7-2 count.
The visitors broke through for 
three more scores in the fourth 
quarter. Starting a drive on their 
own 43 yard line they marched 
down the field to the Plaid six, 
from where Fisher broke over 
center for the score. Jones place 
kick was wide.
As the Tartans gambled for a 
score, Maley attempted to pass to 
Pappafava but Heck intercepted 
on the Tartan 40. After the Engi
neers had driven to the Carnegie 
19 Navarro swept around right 
end for the remaining distance 
and six more points. Kress con
verted.
Carnegie again attempted to 
pass but Maleys aerial was in
tercepted by Shipley. Kress then 
passed to Morris in a play that 
netted 53 yardsLehighs final 
touchdown. Kress placekicked the 
point to end the scoring for the 
day.
The Tartan swimmers, although 
strong in some events, need more 
men to compete in the diving and 
free style events. All those inter
ested are urged to inquire at the 
pool any afternoon as soon as 
possible.

Carnegies wrestling team will 
be built this year around a nu
cleus of six returning veterans. 
These men, with 24 recruits, are 
practicing each Monday, Wednes
day, and Thursday afternoon in 
Thistle hall.
Mr. Alexander, the coach, hopes 
to arrange meets with those 
schools on Carnegies basketball 
schedule who also sponsor wrest
ling squads. The team may attend 
the invitational meet in Cleveland 
and the district intercollegiate 
meet.
Coach Alexander
Swimming Team 
Opens Practice 
Under Sofield
The Carnegie Tech swimming 
team candidates opened their first 
practice two weeks ago under the 
direction of Coach Claude So
field, who has replaced Mr. Risedorph.
Captain Dave Luckey and Bill 
Ferguson will be out to repeat 
their last years successes in the 
breast stroke. Luckey holds the 
present school record for the 200 
yard breast stroke and is expect
ed to better his mark in this 
event.
The return of John Dowd, free
style star for Carnegie in 1943, 
considerably brightens the out
look for the coming season. Dowd 
will bolster the freestyle depart
ment which was hard hit by 
last springs graduation.
Paul Schroeder and Ames Penfield will probably start in the 
backstroke, and Lee Vogle will 
return to swim the 440 yard free
style.
Mr. Alexander became interest
ed in wrestling when he met Sam 
Brown, an Olympic champion. 
That was in 1925 and he has 
been a zealous advocate of the 
sport ever since.
After finishing his days work 
at Westinghouse Electric Corpora
tion in East Pittsburgh, he comes 
to the gym to show the fellows 
the holds and grips peculiar to 
wrestling. He enjoys getting down 
on the mat to demonstrate the ins 
and outs of the holds.
During the war he helped the 
boys in the AST program keep 
fit, being an instructor in wrest
ling and judo. He believes that 
physical well-being is in harmony 
with mental health.
His aim is to convince the ath
letic staff that there are enough 
men interested in wrestling to 
warrant changing the present in
tramural rating to varsity status.
All weight classes, from 125 
pounders through heavyweights, 
are represented on the squad. 
Some have had only high school 
experience or none at all, but not 
one has been afraid to work. Any 
one interested is invited to come 
to Thistle hall at 4:30 on the af
ternoons that practice is held.
If the subject of names is 
brought up in a conversation with 
him, Mr. Alexander will point out 
that he was named after two gen
erals of the Boer War, Cecil Gor
don Alexander.

Music Department Announces 
Addition Of Faculty Members
William Schaefer Appointed Kiltie Director, 
Carolyn Kennedy Womens Glee Club Leader
The Department of Music has announced the addition of two 
faculty members to the music staff, William A. Schaefer and Caro
lyn B. Kennedy. Although both will have regular instructing duties 
in the department of music, their chief responsibilities will be in 
connection with extra-curricular music activities on campus.
Professor Schaefer has been appointed director of the Kiltie 
Mens Glee club. A native of^------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland, he received his masters 
degree from Miami university, and 
later accepted the post of head of 
the music department of West 
Technical high school in Cleveland, 
Ohio. He served as a bandleader 
in the United States Army from 
1942 too 1946.
Miss Kennedy, instructor in 
music education, is a native of 
Cripple Creek, Colorado, and stud
ied for her masters at Northwest
ern university. She recently fin
ished her offices as director of 
music for the East Grand Rapids 
schools in Michigan. In addition to 
her regular teaching duties she 
will direct the Womens Glee club. 
Policy Change
Both the men and Womens Glee 
clubs are looking forward to a re
juvenation of their organizations 
due to the change in policy that 
these appointments indicate. In the 
past these clubs have had direc
tors who were hired for a limited 
time and due to work outside of 
school, were unable to devote 
enough time to the training of the 
glee clubs.
Now that the school has pro
vided both organizations with full
time directors, it is expected that 
the clubs will benefit by an in
crease in membership and activi
ties. More cooperation and con
tact with other campus groups 
than was possible in the past is 
also foreseen by the student man
agers of the clubs, Ed Colaianni 
and Anita Mortimer.
Meeting: Time
Both of the clubs will use MM 
103 for rehearsals. This year the 
Mens Glee club will meet every 
Monday and Wednesday afternoon 
at the same time.
Auditions for the Mens Glee 
club have been held during the 
past week. It is expected that apIntramurals

proximately 50 men will partici

season. The first rehearsal of the 
group was held last Thursday. 
Spring Tour 
Among the major activities plan
ned for this year is a spring con
cert tour of communities in this 
region. Before the war this tour 
was an annual affair and it is hop
ed that the tour this year will re
establish the custom. An invita
tion has been extended to the 
group to participate in an inter
collegiate chorus competition, and 
the club hopes to be able to finance 
the trip that this would involve.
Scarab Sponsors 
Liaison Committee
A liaison committee was re
cently organized in the architec
tural department to promote co
operation and understanding be
tween the faculty and the stu
dents. The cominittee consists of 
faculty members and representa
tives from each class of the stu
dent body.
Sponsored by Scarab, the pro
fessional fraternity of the de
partment, this plan offers an outlet 
for complaints and difficulties. 
Student members will act as the 
middle-men in conveying re
ports between the student body 
and the faculty.
Student representatives are F. 
P. Gassner, freshman; Louis A. 
Goldberg and Irving W. Colburn, 
sophomores; Richard P. Geyser 
and David P. Moyer, juniors; 
Louis F. Valentour Jr., sub-sen
ior; Lawrence C. Wolfe, senior; 
and Elsie P. Boggs of interior dec
oration.
It is hoped that this plan will 
result in a frank student-faculty 
relationship. Plans for the first 
meeting are incomplete as yet.
Carnegie Library 
Restricts Use Of 
Bound Periodicals
Carnegie Library has restrict
ed the use of bound periodicals by 
undergraduate students in an ef
fort to help preserve them.
This announcement, made by 
the director of the library, Mr. 
Ralph Munn, was brought about; 
by excessive wear and tear on 
these valuable materials. The 
periodicals, which have been of 
great value to students for assign
ments and research, will be made 
available to students and mem
bers of debate teams who have 
letters from their instructors or 
coaches stating that access to the 
files is necessary.

Returns To City
The Ballet theatre, probably the 
finest ballet company in exist

on Tuesday and Wednesday even
ings, after a three year absence. 
With the company were such stars 
as Igor Youskevitch, Nora Kaye, 
Hugh Laing, Alicia Alonso, Di
mitri Romanoff, and many others.
This company is a non-profit 
organization created to assure the 
preservation of ballet. It has co
ordinated the skills of many of 
the finest figures in the art world, 
such as Anthony Tudor, Agnes 
De Mille, and Jerome Robbins.
The program for Wednesday in
cluded Interplay, Facsimile, and 
Giselle, thus comprising a well 
balanced concert. Facsimile, writ
ten by Jerome Robbins, a psycho
logical study of two men and a 
woman, is the latest ballet by an 
American choreographer. This 
work, because of its modernism, 
made an interesting contrast with 
Giselle, which is a classical ballet 
currently performed.

A much more sensible policy for 
the government to adopt would be 
one of creating a healthier atmo

The Taft-Hartley law, in its

the first step in the about face

Entrepreneurs will not risk the

A quiz show conducted by Dr.

daily program, Variety Club.
The show will be on a highly 
competitive basis, since the con
testants each week will be three 
representatives from every fra
ternity, sorority, dormitory, and 
any other organization that wishes 
to enter. At the end of the series, 
a cup will be awarded to the or
ganization which has accumulated 
the highest score.
Questions used on the broad
cast will be of a broad and gen
eral nature. In this way Variety

of student interest in the entire 
production by encouraging actual 
student participation, said 
Michael J. Bodnar, producer.
With over a hundred partici

he has gone to a convention out

but out in the corn and cattle 
country. His destination Is un
known but someone said it may 
be Wisconsin. Hope he has a nice 
trip! He plans to visit quite a few 
colleges on his return trip.

Looking at the bulletin boards 
about the campus, one can usually 
find notices posted about lost and 
found articles. How many of these 
lost articles are returned1 is a 
mystery to most of us but perhaps 
we may be able to help to get 
some of these items back. Our 
first customer is Hooper and he 
would appreciate the return of his 
slide rule which was lost in Ma
chinery Hall.
Floyd Byers tells me he doesnt

Speaking of holidaysthe city

Those tags do become expensive.
Just how accurate can a group

Schnabel Solos 
With Symphony
By Marvin Bachman
The Pittsburgh Symphony with 
Artur Schnabel as the featured 
soloist, reached a new high in its 
fourth concert, on Friday night, 
November 14 at the Syria Mosque. 
On the program was Smetanas 
Overture to the Bartered Bride, 
two Mozart piano concertos, and 
Beethovens Eighth Symphony.
Mr. Schnabel, playing with the 
sdbtlely, clarity, and finesse for 
which he is so well known, re
ceived a warm ovation from the 
audience.
It is interesting to note the 
amazing improvement in the or
chestra since its first concert this 
year. It has now obtained clarity 
and ensemble, and we may right
fully look forward to a successful 
season. This improvement was evi
dent in the exceptional rendition 
of Beethovens Eighth for which 
Dr. Reiner deserves much praise.
Next weeks concert will feature 
the famed cellist, Stephen Auber, as soloist.

PLAID Wants Student Views 
On Evening School Activities
The PLAID is your page. As any newspaper is the voice of the 
people in a certain society; the PLAID is the voice of the students 
attending evening classes at Carnegie Tech. Carnegie is your society 
while you are here; the PLAID is your voice from that society.
But in order for your opinion to be expressed, you must make 
known your views on situations of the group.
The PLAID endeavors to express this opinion but falls short of 
this goal because of the limited ?-----------------------------------------------------
number of people who write what 
you read on this page. This is the 
result of the small representation 
on the PLAID staff of the four
teen hundred and some students 
attending evening classes.
We can give you the news of 
our activities, of our students and 
of our part on the campus. We 
want to tell you morewe want 
you to know what is pertinent to 
the evening student as an indi
vidual.
And since we studentsas all 
othersare individuals, it is from 
the individual that we hope to 
gather more detailed information 
for publication on this page.
Here, fellow students, is where 
you can fit very nicely into the 
picture of the PLAID. To be more 
specific, we want comments from 
you. And we want these to come 
from you in your letters to the 
PLAID.
A letter to the PLAID is not a 
complicated process. Just write 
what you think and we will air 
your opinion. Your name will be 
*4gned when your letter is print
ed if you so specify; if you pre
fer to remain anonymous, we have 
no objections.
If you have objections to the 
way in which evening Student 
Council functions, we want to 
know. If you believe the PLAID 
can be improved, we are open for 
your suggestions and comments. 
Whatever your opinion is on any
matter pertaining to evening 
classes, it will be welcomed and 
reviewed on your page. Your let
ters will not be altered as to their 
content. They will be printed as 
you write themwith no editorial 
views repressed.
We want your opinionsit is 
up to you to furnish them.
Address your letters to the 
PLAID, Box 256, Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology.
Typists Needed
Would you like to meet peo
ple and make friends? If so, 
girls, how about helping out a 
couple of engineers in distress. 
In other wordsNeeded: typ
ists to type letters to engi
neering companies about news 
of the annual Engineering Ban
quet. As an added attraction 
or perhaps this will be the at
traction if you dont like en
gineers  points towards an 
Evening Sehool Achievement 
award will be given.
So how bout it, gals?this 
is really an S.O.S.
If interested, contact eithei 
Jim Flaherty or Ray Schwalm 
through CIT Box 256.
Modern Acting Has Eliminated 
Tearjerkers Of Yesteryear
Gone, alas; is the tearjerker of 
yesteryear. The Little Theater 
production of Secret Service bears 
little resemblance to the stark 
melodrama of the play as origi
nally presented by William Gil
lette. Modem conceptions of act
ing and audience reaction have 
made some of the scenes, written 
as the most tense and dramatic, 
become extremely funny.
Under the direction of Mr. Tal
bert Pearson, the dramats have 
staged this turn-of-the-century 
drama in ah admirable manner. 
The sets and lighting effects 
were noteworthy, as was the stage 
management by Dave Crantz.
The story is on the hackneyed 
theme of Good triumphant over 
evil and was scripted in the tradi
tional manner. The fact that the 
style is new to Carnegie patrons 
redeemed the show in our eyes.
Creditable performances were 
given by both casts, but especial 
ly praiseworthy were those by 
Renee Orkin as Edith Varney, the 
generals beautiful daughter; Kay 
Thompson as Mrs. Varney, the 
generals wife; Louis Edmonds as 
Captain Thom, the handsome 
leading man; and Vince OBrier 
as Benton Arrelsford, the villain 
oils counterspy.

national officers will be present at 
the installation.
Pi Mu Epsilon was founded in 
1914 at Syracuse university. It 
spread slowly at first, then with 
increasing speed to its present size 
of 43 chapters. It conducts math
ematical contests, awards prizes, 
sponsors lectures by distinguished 
mathematicians, and promotes the 
organization of math clubs in high 
schools and colleges.
Officers of the Carnegie chap
ter will be David Wallace, direc
tor; Don Harris, vice-director; 
Robert Siegel, secretary; and Ed 
King, treasurer. The executive 
committee consists of the officers 
and graduate students Forman Ac
ton, Claire Maple, and Chester 
Leaman.
Lets all go over to Thistle Hall on November 
29, for the Annual Thanksgiving Dance sponsored 
by the Evening Student Council. Dancing from 8:30 
to 12:00 to the Take It Easy tempos of Tommy 
Carlyn and his Orchestra, featuring Dell Saunders, 
Happy Huston. Billy Sagone and the Carlyn Trio 
and Quartette.
During intermission, the Black Cat Lounge will 
be the scene of friendly gatherings, while dancers 
enjoy a refreshing pause.
This second dance of the year is another re
vival of pre-war dances. In the past this dance was
* a memorable event, enjoyed by all 
who attended.
George Bogovich, the social 
chairman, extends a cordial in
vitation to all the evening school 
students, their friends, and all 
others who may wish to attend. 
Lets all have a good time and 
make this dance a tremendous so
cial success.
