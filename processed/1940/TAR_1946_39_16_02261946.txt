Thunhurst Selected King By 
Crowd At Mortar Board Dance
Junior Honorary 
Postpones Prom
In a meeting of the Delta Skulls 
held at 4:30 P. M, Thursday, Feb
ruary 21, in the Union, it was de
cided that the crowded condition 
of the social calendar will not per
mit this honorary to sponsor a 
Junior Prom this semester. In
stead, it was decided that the so
cial chairman should petition Stu
dent Couniil for a date ior the 
Junior Prom tentatively schedul
ed for the latter part of October 
of this year. Full particulars are 
to be presented to Student Council 
along with the petition. A Hal
loween theme was suggested, and, 
because this will be one of the 
first of the major social events of 
the new school year, the possi
bility of a date bureau was dis
cussed. Art Slagle, who will still 
be a member of Delta Skull next 
Fall, was appointed Social Chair
man of the honorary in charge of 
drafting the petition to Student 
Council.
Before the meeting was ad
journed, the eligibility of Dick 
Heckman to become a member of 
Delta Skull was discussed. It was 
decided that his points should be 
evaluated and be placed in the 
hands of the Mens Points Com
mittee. The Chairman of this 
committee will, in turn, ask Stu
dent Council to pass on those ac
tivities considered by the Council, 
to be applicable to membership 
in Delta Skull. This is necessary 
because Mr. Heckman attended 
Swarthmore for three years before 
transferring to Tech, and this is 
one case where points definitely 
can be evaluated. Ultimately, the 
fact of Mr. Heckmans becoming 
a member of Delta Skull will be 
decided by the necessary threequarters majority vote of the Delta 
Skull members. Dick Storm was 
asked to act for Delta Skull in this 
matter.
The meeting was then adjourn
ed, and President Straka asked 
that all members be present at the 
next meeting to be held at 4:30 
P. M. Thursday, February 28, in 
the Union.

BILL, THUNHURST 
King of Hearts
Long live the King! Bill Thun
hurst was elected King of Hearts 
at the Mortar Board dance Satur
day night. While all the dancers 
waited in anticipation, Dottie 
Feldman, president of Mortar 
Board, expressed her apprecia
tion for student support of the 
danceabout 350 tickets were 
soldthen looked over the group 
of candidates carefully, and final
ly placed the crown on the head 
of Thunhurst.
Thunhurst, Beta Theta Pis can
didate, made a short speech of 
thanks, then asked the question 
in everyones mind, But who 
is Rumpty H. Coo?
The dance was very successful, 
as evidenced by the number of 
couples theretoo many for com
fortable dancing. Many sought re
lief from the crowd in the Boot 
and Saddle, which also became 
very crowded.
Students at the dance were fas
cinated by the beauty queen 
sashes worn by the candidates 
and the show put on by Dr. Coos 
adherentsA vote for Coo is a 
vote for a free Mongolia. All 
in all, a vote of thanks should go 
to the Mortar Board for organiz
ing a swell dance.
Carnegie Technical Techsperts 
Offer to Answer Questions
Most people spend their lives 
dodging trouble, but a few brash 
souls actually go out of their 
way to look for it. Or at least you 
would think that of a group like 
the Techsperts, the eight aspir
ing scientists who are advertis
ing all over the campus that they 
will answer any question submit
ted to them, and are willing to 
back up that claim by putting $5 
on the line. The eight are Walter 
Blissel, Eli Freedman, Art Opinsky, John Osterle, Lou Bright, 
Ben Schwartz, Lou Umbach, and 
Carl Weber. They are the right
ful heirs to the tradition be
queathed by the original Teohsperts, founded in 1943. The 
echsperts solution to the brain 
easers you send in will be print
'd in each issue of the Carnegie 
echnical.
Any problems in mathematics 
or in the sciences which has a 
definite, categorical solution is ac
ceptable. A question that stump
ed the Techsperts in previous 
years, for instance, was how to 
invert a hollow rubber ball with
out cutting it. Some questions 
cause quite a controversy. In one 
case, letters were flying thick and 
fast between Carnegie Tech and 
Penn State when some students 
there thought the Techsperts 
were in error, but the Techsperts 
won out.
The Techsperts usually solve 
their problems without any out
side references to help them. 
They do not meet in flowing black 
robes to mull over their esoteric 
dilemmas, as is commonly sup
posed. The procedure is simply 
to submit the problems to any 
one of the Techsperts and to pass 
it on if he is stumped. Problems 
should be sent through inter
school mail to Techsperts, Car
negie Technical. If you stump 
the Techsperts, you get $3; if you 
can solve the problem yourself, an 
additional $2.
Notice
A bulletin board has been 
placed outside of Room 155 
on the first floor of Industries 
Hall for posting notices for 
veterans. All veterans are re
quested to refer to this bul
letin board at frequent inter
vals as the Veterans Center 
will use this means of contact
ing veterans.
Spring Carnival 
Has Call Day
Saturday, May 4, will be a big 
day on the Tech campus, for it 
marks the first complete day of 
Spring Carnival activities. The 
return of Call Day after an ab
sence of two years will be a big 
event in the morning. Call Day is 
the traditional time when each 
honorary on campus names its 
prospective members, calling the 
candidates forward to be receiv
ed with ceremony. All honoraries 
which intend to take new mem
bers should be prepared to do it 
at this time so that the initiates 
may take part in the activities.
Following the Call Day cere
mony in the morning will be the 
coronation of the queen and the 
sweepstakes finals. It has been 
several years since the little fra
ternity buggies have been seen 
racing up and down the streets, 
but the afternoon of May 4 will 
witness their return.
Tutoring Classes 
Are Arranged 
By Tau Beta Pi
Joe Franz, President of Tau 
Beta Pi, has announced that mem
bers of the organization will tutor 
freshmen and first semester soph
omores in chemistry, mathematics, 
and physics starting Wednesday of 
this week. The first classes for or
ganization will be Wednesday and 
Thursday of this week.
The classes being tutored in
clude E-101, E-102, chemistry; C-l, 
C-2, C-2E, and C-3, mathematics; 
E-91, E-91E, E-92, and E-93,
physics.
The days assigned for tutoring 
are Tuesday for chemistry and 
E-93, Wednesday, all mathematics 
classes, Thursday for all physics 
classes except E-93.
Tutoring will begin at 4:30 on 
the designated days and will be 
held in the math wing, 1st floor, 
Industries.
These plans have been announc
ed in all chemistry and mathe
matics classes. If any students de

courses they may petition Tau 
Beta Pi. These petitions must be 
signed by at least six of the stu
dents desiring tutoring.
Student Council 
Plans Stag Dance
On Saturday, March 2, Student 
Council will hold, a dance after 
the basketball game with Case. It 
will be held in the newly decorat
ed Thistle Hall until one oclock. 
As usual, A. P. O. will take charge 
of refreshments in the Black Cat. 
If the tea dance on Wednesday, 
February 27, proves successful, 
a school orchestra will supply the 
music on Saturday. If not, the re
liable juke box will have to be 
ued.
Another dance will be held alter 
the West Virginia game on Satur
day, March 9. This game will end 
the season, so this will be the last 
affair of its kind.

was held to fill for one semester 
the position vacated by Irwin 
Aisenberg.
Voting was held in the hallway 
of Administration HaH between 
12:30 and 3:30 P. M., and a com
paratively light vote was cast, 
probably due to the bad weather.
Lou assumes his new duties with 
an active field of accomplishments 
behind him. Lou, besides being a 
member of the Theta Xi Frater

Except for several outstanding 
canvases, the oil group is more 
or less mediocre. It is not a par
ticularly exciting shgw; however, 
it is a relief to see a change in at
titude as compared to the warinspired paintings that dominated 
exhibitions during the war period.
Samuel Rosenbergs rich lumin
ous paintings made an impressive 
showing. They are beautiful from 
the standpoint of workmanship 
and remarkable in the clarity 
with which the artists idea is ex
pressed. Mr. Rosenbergs paint
ings are of moral and social sig
nificance. They depict life with
out resorting to photographic du
plication.
Also rich in a gay whimsical 
way is Louise Pershings He said

multaneously laughs and
pathizes with women of small 
towns.
Three oil paintings and a litho
graph are exhibited by Wilfred A. 
Readio, head of the P. & D. De

What Has Religion For You
This is Religious Discussion Week on the Carnegie cam
pus. To most of you we are afraid this fact means absolutely 
nothing. You will perhaps see the posters and read the articles, 
and you might even go to the assembly, but you wont really 
think about religion this week any more than you have all 
year and it still wont mean a thing to you. We frankly admit 
that it doesnt mean very much to us either, but we wonder 
whether we all arent missing something by ignoring it.
College students find it very easy to ignore religion from 
day to day. They are in many cases far removed from the 
parents and friends they knew in their church groups at home, 
and it seems just too much trouble to find a new church in 
the new environment. Then too, the problems faced by the 
average college boy or girl are not so great that they feel the 
nppd of a deitys aid in their solution. Science and history 
1 to destroy faith by their material approach to 
nd life in general is so full of living that there
_________It time for spiritual contemplation. Many students
come to feel that there is no real validity in the claims made 
by religious leaders and that religion really offers nothing to 
an intelligent and reasonable human being. However, religion, 
faith in a deity, has meant a great deal to a great many men 
throughout the ages, and we may be depriving ourselves of a 
very important part of life by making such assumptions.
Throughout this week, men and women who have found 
that faith plays an important part in their lives will be 
speaking to groups on campus. They have found that faith 
is important for them in this modern age. We owe it to our
selves to go to these meetings and to discover whether religion 
can be a functional part of our lives, whether it can make life 
more beautiful and meaningful for us, the dwellers in the 
technological era.
Could It Be Me??
There has been a great to-do on campus for the past sev
eral weeks over the selections made by Student Council for 
the Sophomore and Junior class honoraries. A great deal of 
censure has been cast upon campus politics and upon the 
inefficiency of student government. We do not feel, however, 
that the students should bear the brunt of the blame for slip
shod reactivation, for the Administration has set an example 
of inefficient and unfair choice before the students which 
might easily lead them to believe that adequate qualifications 
are of only minor importance in the selection of members of 
honoraries.
In the early fall, several faculty members, fraters of 
Omicron Delta Kappa, formed a committee the purpose of 
which was the reactivation of the Carnegie chapter of ODK. 
Undoubtedly their motives were as lofty and noble as could 
possibly be desired by the candidates for membership. It is 
yery unlikely that any of the faculty members were under 
the influence of a campus pressure group. Logically these men 
should have had access to accurate statistics concerning the 
men to be taken. Yet the errors made by them in their choice 
of men for ODK were at least as glaring as those made by the 
Points and Keys Committee. One man chosen for the hon
orary did not possess a factor high enough to render him 
eligible. One man chosen has since had to drop out of school 
' '"ause his factor was less than a 1.5. Two of those selected 
' - were not active in enough campus activities to merit 
^n. Several Juniors were taken ostensibly for 
enough members to make the hon1 in its first reactivation year, yet 
far more active than many 
'm the society. In view

SKIBO VS. CHAPEL
Pittsburgh, Pa., 
February 19, 1946.
Dear Editor:
Those on campus who missed 
last Tuesdays assembly missed 
one of the finest religious discus
sions we at Carnegie have had 
thus far. We need such chapels 
more often.
As all three speakers  Rev. 
Smith, Father Foley, and Rabbi 
Freehof  pointed out, that it is 
faith we need today  a united 
faith in God.
It is too bad that the students 
of Carnegie Tech feel a greater 
urge to rush to Skibo or the 
Beanery during chapel hour (as if 
that Xed hour on their Tues
day schedule means nothing!) 
rather than to attend those muchneeded religious emphasis meet
ings which come but once a year.
On Carnegie Day, as we know 
it, libraries and classrooms are 
closed, while everyone on the 
campus meets to honor our foun
der. If, as our speakers related, 
Carnegie was himselif a religious 
man, then why is it not proper 
that once a year we should like
wise set aside the same amount 
of time for our Maker.
It is up to the Youth to bring 
about a change in living which 
the world so greatly needs, and 
especially is it up to the college 
youth, for they are to be the lead
ers of our nation very shortly.
Its about time we stop making 
light of the moral and spiritual 
conditions of the universe, and 
begin to realize that there are 
those who could lead us to a hap
pier, more contented world if we 
were to give a little. Such lead
ers deserve our fullest coopera
tion and a few less snickers from 
behind.

Pittsburgh Women 
Plan Benefit Bridge
On March 9, at 2:00 P. M., The 
Pittsburgh Womens Clan, a wom
ens alumnae organization of Car
negie Tech, is again holding its 
traditional scholastic benefit 
bridge party in the newly re
decorated Thistle Hall. Attractive 
bridge prizes will be given, and 
nothing will be sold. Tables are 
$5.00 including tax, and singles 
are $1.25 including tax. Reserva
tions should be made before 
March 5 with Miss Martha Eggers 
or Miss Eleanor Tamadge or in 
246-A, the Alumni Office in Ad
ministration Hall. Remittances 
should be sent to Mrs. Earl S. 
Thorpe, 1431 La Salle Avenue, 
Pittsburgh 16, Pa. Checks should 
be made payable to Miss Dorothy 
Pritchard. Partners will be pro
vided for all those who come 
alone.
The purpose of the bridge is to 
secure money for the scholarships 
awarded annually to needy and 
scholastically worthy Margaret 
Morrison and Fine Arts women 
students. Since 1909 the Clan has 
awarded approximately 150 schol
arships.

RDT TALKS BACK
It seems that an answer to last 
weeks answers is definitely indi
cated. If my little note has merely 
succeeded in stirring up a bit of 
activity (as it evidently has), it 
was more than worth while. 
Though it seems to have been 
misconstrued by many, my pur
pose in writing was not to be 
bitter, nor to complain unduly, 
but to present a situation. I had 
and have nothing at stake, being 
totally ineligible for both organ
izations. And I intended only to 
point out mistakes, not to criti
cize the organizations themselves.
Before plunging further, how
ever, let me toss many thanks 
in the direction of To the De
fense. Support constantly re
minds me of the adage: United 
we stand; divided we sprawl.
This entire answer business 
could continue all semester in a 
sort of editorial leap-frog. This is 
not my intention, and I would 
like to end the whole thing with 
this letter (though anyone who 
wants to moan in reply is cer
tainly welcome to do so).
I have definite charges to an
swer. In writing originally, it 
seems that I was guilty of:
1. An amazing lack of analy
sis and many mistaken concep
tions (probably in regard to 
point considerations and average 
factor).
2. Making snap judgments bas
ed on insufficient knowledge and 
presenting petty, uneonstructive 
complaints.
3. Adopting a holier than 
thou attitude in objecting, too 
late, that a Scimitar had been 
accused of cheating on exams.
4. Questioning a double mem
bership which is certainly legal.
5. Suggesting that any one on 
Student Council would even con
sider fraternity affiliations.
Answers to the preceding 
charges are:
1. In gathering my information 
I collected information from Dean 
Warden, from the Registrars 
office, from members of Scimitar, 
from members of Delta Skull, and 
from a brief discussion with the 
Chairman of the Mens Points 
Committee. The facts gathered I 
analyzed to the best of my ability 
and arrived at some evident con
clusions. I wonder how soon the 
man with the low factor might 
have left Scimitar without these 
conclusions, and I can easily show 
that a member of Delta Skull has 
less than a 1.75 average factor as 
a civilian student at CIT.
2. The above indicates that 
there were no snap judgments. I 
would not consider the wide
spread complaints presented as 
being particularly petty.
3. Since last writing I have
been informed that cheating on 
examinations must be well-nigh 
universal and not to be frowned 
upon. Such practices seem to be 
highly undesirable, regardless, and 
would seem to defeat the purpose 
of examinations. I would wonder 
more about a person who would 
call such an objection childish 
than I would about the member 
of an honorary who might pos
sibly have cheated.
4. I was not disputing the le
gality of a double election to ODK 
and Delta Skull. I was question
ing the conflict between national 
and local rules which allowed 
such a situation to develop in two 
organizations which should logi
cally and fairly be mutually ex
clusive. The answers seem to in
dicate that things which may be 
wrong for only one semester are 
not really wrong at all. Both the 
men considered, incidentally, are 
members of Student Council.
5. To this charge I would mere
ly reply that over half the total 
membership of both organizations 
is confined to only two fraterni
ties, both of which boast a mem
ber prominent in Student Coun
cil.
I hope that this statement clari
fies my purposes in writing pre
viously. R.D.T.
MORE ON BLUE JEANS
Dear Editor:
After reading this weeks Tar
tan Id like to make a few com
ments that might shed a bit of 
light for the Tech girls. Most of 
the men who were overseas saw a 
very miserable assortment of peo
ple dressed in ill-fitting rags. 
These folk were the terrible af
termath of the war which up
rooted whole towns and moved 
them thousands of miles and then 
plunked them down in a new 
locale. Then, as the economic sys
tem upon which they were de
pendent collapsed, they were left 
stranded and destitute.
We saw a lot of these people 
reduced to the role of tramps and 
we got a belly full of it. Its not 
very pleasant to see and know 
people who are starving and 
freezing to death.
Do you wonder then that some 
of us get peeved when we see 
some of you, who have every
thing possible at your finger tips 
to enhance your 'good looks, go 
around looking no better than 
those unfortunate Europeans who 
must, of necessity, look like 
tramps?
No sir, lady!the girl I date 
will have to look pretty neat and, 
since I make most of my dates 
when I see the girls during the 
day, the tramps are out. Im sorry 
that your school work demands 
that you wear such an assort
ment of clothing but I still have 
had a belly full of looking at 
tramps so for my money, lady, 
you lose.

The problem of giving as many 
veterans as possible the college 
education due them has been seri
ously considered by executives of 
American colleges in recent years. 
The leading schools have been ex
panded to the greatest practicable 
limits, but new twists are being 
developed to admit a few more 
students. The University of 
Washington, for example, expects 
to be operating on a six-day-aweek, fourteen-hour-a-day sched
ule fry the fall of this year. Vet
erans who were unable to regis
ter for the regular semesters pro
gram at the George Washington 
University in Washington, D. C., 
will be able to audit the classes 
they wish to attend if facilities 
are available for them. They will 
receive no credit or subsistance 
benefits for this, but they will be 
assured of an easier time when 
they begin regular classes. Many 
a veteran is burning the midnight 
oil and then some in an effort to 
remember subject matter which is 
prerequisite to the courses he is 
taking.
The American University in 
Washington, D. C., is offering a 
unique program to a few honor 
students at Oberlin, Allegheny, 
Hiram, Westminster, and Wooster
Colleges who are majoring in so
cial or governmental sciences. 
They will take the second semes
ter of their junior year at Ameri
can University in order to get a 
first hand understanding of the 
political and governmental prob
lems they are studying. The UniJ 
versity will pay their tuitions plus 
the additional living expenses in
curred in overcrowded Washing
ton. Each of the five participating 
colleges will furnish an instructor 
every fifth year to teach at the 
American University and act as 
advisor and counselor to the visit-) 
ing students. In addition to round
ing out the education of the me 
participating in this program, bet 
ter understanding will be fostere< 
among people from various part 
of the country. Wartime, experi 
ence has indicated that this i 
quite necessary. Perhaps the calm 
er atmosphere of an educational 
institution will aid this under

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1946_____________________________THE CARNEGIE TARTAN 3
Campaign for King of Hearts 
Animates Apathetic Techites
Magician Baffles 
AIEE At Smoker
The A.I.E.E. Smoker held in 
Carnegie Union Thursday, Febru
ary 20, proved to be a huge suc
cess with a large group of stu
dents and faculty in attendance. 
The smoker was held in order 
that the older members could be
come acquanited with the new 
men who entered Tech this sem
ester.
Not only did the electricals 
have a ten-piece orchestra to en
tertain the men with popular 
songs, but they also had a ma
gician. He baffled even the quizkid engineers by his amazing 
ability to make articles as cards' 
and neckties reappear after cut
ting them to pieces. One of his 
most interesting acts was burning 
a dollar and then pulling it out 
of one of three cigarettes thrown 
from the audience.
After the entertainment, soft 
drinks and cookies were served 
The evening closed with a few 
rousing Tech songs with everyone 
in agreement that it was one of 
the best meetings of the year.
The E.E.s have been very ac
tive this past school year, having 
held two field trips and one smok
er previous to this one. They are 
planning more similar affairs and 
also a picnic in the spring.
Tech Vets Form 
Housing Group
Two weeks ago Techs veterans 
organized a group to coordinate 
veterans housing problems, which 
include finding additional housing 
for the vets and finding bigger 
and better homes for those with 
wives and children.
It has been decided with Dr. 
Wardens approval to set up a 
special office which will serve all 
the vets needs. The vets will be 
asked to hand in any information 
available about vacant rooms, 
apartments, and homes, and these 
possibilities will be thoroughly in
vestigated by some capable per
son. The real estate companies 
will also be of assistance.
The next meeting is to be held 
on Wednesday, February 27.
Maggie Murphs Plan 
Party for Freshmen
The sophomore class of Mar
garet Morrison will give an in
formal party for the Maggie 
Murph freshmen March sixth. 
This get together will be held 
in the Margaret Morrison recrea
tion room from 4:00 to 6:00. As 
yet plans are incomplete but all 
freshmen are assured of a good 
time.
French Students Have 
Automobile Accident
At 1:10 last Sunday morning an 
unfortunate accident occurred 
when a car driven by Hubert 
Budout, one of the French students 
at Tech, crashed into a telephone 
pole near the Carnegie Library. In 
the car were Eleanor York, Kaye 
Reading, Patricia Cochran rom 
P. C. W., Jacque Barranquet, and 
John Pierre Marfrang. They have 
all been released from the hos
pital except Eleanor York who had 
a few stitches taken in her fore
head.
Science Club Plans
At a meeting held last Wednes
day, the Science Club of Mar
garet Morrison decided on a pro
gram for the semester. They will 
hold a dinner meeting March 6th 
in the little room in Skibo. Field 
trips to the Heinz Plant and other 
places of interest will be taken 
during the semester. Members 
should pay their dues, 50c, as 
soon as possible. With this money 
and that earned by the sale of 
second-hand dissecting kits the 
club will hold a party at the end 
of the year.
The campaign for the King of 
Hearts had been the biggest thing 
that has hit school this year. 
Everyone from the Hubba Hubba 
Girl to the Doctor, Lawyer and In
dian Chief had been speculating on 
the favorite. The prospective 
Kings and their backers stopped 
at nothing. Coeds put all their 
spare nickels into the juke box 
to hear the Personality of the 
PiKA candidate, Andy Krestel. 
The cigarette machine broke down 
from over usage. Even Dean Yon 
tried several times before she got 
a pack of matches with Andy Ks 
swoonderful picture on it. The 
Yellow Beetle has a piece of 
Skibos door as a souvenir from its 
escapade into the Beanery. And 
the noise (or was it music?) wasnt 
too bad either. Dr. Coo, the mys
tery man, had pickets in front of 
Maggie Murph as early as 8:30 A. 
M. He also had them in front of 
Skibo passing out handbills in 
the fight for bigger and better Yak 
eggs. As a matter of fact, it 
seems that Abe Hopper stalked 
Maggie Murph all day with the 
sign Foo on Coo. Acrobats 
broke their legs getting signs 
up on Fine Arts. The Tau 
Delts came down from the top of 
the Arts Building with frozen 
noses and toes when they tried to 
get a sign for Buddy Yorkin to 
stay up there. But since they had 
so much confidence in their can
didate, they decided not to stoop 
to any violent publicity. The 
beautiful, lifesize picture of Bill 
Thunhurst lasted, about two min
utes after End Man Casey hung 
it up. Evidently an admirer 
thought it would look better hang
ing in her boudoir. We can thank 
the Beta Theta Pis for the terrific 
afternoon music in Skibo on Fri
day afternoon. They had a loud 
speaker inside and out. A rose
bud to Viera Kulamer who sang 
about My Embraeeable Thun
hurst. _ Now she wants to meet 
him. There was a pennant on 
the flagpole, but I couldnt see 
the name on it cause it was so 
far up. Sandwich men haunted 
every corner of campus barking 
their candidates. And for a week 
everyone was wondering who 
KOHAS was, until someone fig
ured out that it stood for King of 
Hearts, Alex Sherman, a Beta 
Sig man. And what person (?)
Prof. Society 
Holds Banquet
The engineering honorary Theta 
Tau held a banquet for last se
mesters initiates at four oclock 
on Sunday afternoon, the 24th of 
February. Mr. Daniels, Director of 
Admissions and a member ot Theta 
Tau, acted as the toastmaster. Mr. 
Tom Griggs, a successmul Pitts
burgh lawyer and a Theta Tau 
alumnus, gave the keynote address 
about Current Industrial Prob
lems. Among the sixteen attend
ing the meeting were Dr. Jones, 
Director of the College of Engi
neering, and Professor Fettke, 
geology expert.
put the placard in the powder 
room at Skibo, that said: Kohas 
was Here!! Bets were flying 
thick and fast on who was going to 
win. The back of Whitfield Hall 
had two paint jobs in one week, 
thanks to the DUs who were 
backing Bob Kindi. Some of their 
signs were up two weeks in ad
vance. And we couldnt imagine 
who Rotinay Yekcim was until the 
cheering section in Skibo intro
duced him as Mickey Yanitor 
spelled backwards. Even George 
Washington was supporting 
Mickey. We wonder who made 
the gorgeous poster with all the 
pictures of handsome Jack Devine 
mounted on lacy hearts. A piece 
of perfection! And how did the 
picture of Andy get into the 
MMCC ladies room? One enthu
siastic chap with a balloon and a 
pledge paddle roamed around 
Skibo promising that if the T Xs 
candidate, Jack Sutton, won every
one could give him a whack with 
the paddle. Well I said the en
thusiasm hit all corners of cam
pus, but re-ally! I even heard 
about C. and V. who were backing 
The Zebra, a dark horse or 
should we say a striped horse. 
Thats a pun, son! The news of 
the King of Hearts traveled all 
the way down to that high, unfin
ished stone structure, and a few 
of the inmates came to the dance 
on Saturday to see the outcome of 
the crowning.
But I must say, it made this old 
heart happy to see the all out 
spirit and clean fun that everyone 
had during the campaign. Lets 
have many more of them . . .

Student Council
Because of the graduation of 
Irv Aisenberg from Student Coun
cil, election of a new Vice-presi
dent was held last Tuesday. Augie 
Binder was elected Vice-President 
for the rest of the year.
Other business conducted at the 
meeting of February 12 included 
approval of Beaux Arts Ball Bud
get providing there is a minimum 
of $900 in the Deans office by 
March 22. The Tea Dance was 
changed from February 20 to 
February 27, and it was suggested 
that Bob Kellys orchestra be se
cured. Panhellenic Council was 
granted permission to hold a 
Chocolate Hour for freshman 
girls in the Union February 20 
from 4:30 to 6:00 p. m.
Budgets from all organizations 
must be handed in to Student 
Council by April 16, 1946. Mr. 
Yurchison reported that Scimitars 
will help the Cwens with the 
Soph Hop. He also presented a 
budget, but it was suggested that 
all necessary items would be pro
vided for by Student Council ac
cording to Scimitars Constitu
tion.
Student Council Gives 
Unsuccessful Dance
On Friday night, February 22, 
Student Council sponsored a 
Freshman Mixer in Thistle Hall. 
The dance, much to their disap
pointment, was not a success. Not 
only did few students attend, but 
they also danced very little. No 
refreshments were served because 
A.P.O. could not be secured to 
take care of the Black Cat for 
such a small dance. Although 
scheduled until one oclock, the 
dance ended at twelve. Student 
Council held this Mixer so that 
the new engineers and veterans 
could become acquainted with 
some of the girls on campus. Either 
these fellows did not know about 
it because of the lack of publicity, 
or perhaps they were just not 
interested.
Pr. Mitchell Joins 
Home Ec. Dept
Helen S. Mitchell, a new pro
fessor of Nutrition in Margaret 
Morrison, is really an asset to the 
Home Economics Department. 
She holds the Bachelor of Sci
ence degree from Mount Holyoke 
and a Ph.D. in Physiological 
Chemistry from Yale.
In the two years before the war, 
Miss Mitchell taught at Massachusettes State College in Am
herst, Mass. When the war broke 
out, however, she went to gov
ernment work as Chief Nutrition
ist in the National Nutrition Pro
gram. When this program was 
dissolved, she became Chief Nu
tritionist for the Office of Foreign 
Relief.
Although Miss Mitchell thought 
she would not care to live in 
Pittsburgh, she finds that her 
classes and students are more 
than enough compensation for its 
smog and dirt. She said she is 
glad to be back teaching in col
lege because that is the kind of 
work she enjoys most.
Miss Mitchell is not only inter
ested in the science of nutrition 
but also in its application to hu
man welfare in the family and 
community.
I.R.C. Will Discuss 
Military Occupation
Next Wednesday, February 27, 
the International Relations Club 
will hold its weekly discussions at 
4:30 p. m. in room 102 of the Mar
garet Morrison Biulding. The top
ic for this week is The Ameri
can Occupation of Germany.
Last week there was a hot and 
fast discussion on Is Labor too 
Strong? This question proved to 
be particularly provocative since 
it has proved to be one of the 
leading problems facing our Coun
try today.

4THE CARN15GIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1946
Meet MM's Robert J. Staley.As We See It
Physics and Math Professor Spirit Is Dead
Presenting the Simplified Guide 
To the Carnegie Tech Campus
PROF. R. J. STALEY
Professor Robert J. Staley, the 
man all the students who take 
physics and mathematics in Mar
garet Morrison claim as their 
favorite prof, is a very con
genial person with true Southern 
hospitality. He may always be 
seen with a friendly smile and a 
hello for everyone.
His Southern hospitality is 
probably due to the fact that he 
was bawn and raised in Vir
ginia. He attended Roanoke Uni
versity in Virginia where he re
ceived his Bachelor of Science 
and Master of Science degrees. 
He went to Columbia University, 
the University of Texas, and the 
University of Pittsburgh for grad
uate work.
He has few hobbies, but takes 
great interest in those he likes. 
His main hobby, gardening, is one 
he first gained an interest in at 
the beginning of the war, four 
years ago. He has become so en
thusiastic about growing vegeta
bles that victory gardening has 
become a permanent hobby. He 
also likes golf and is a bridge en
thusiast. As many Techites know 
by experience, hes always ready 
to lend a helping hand to the be
ginners.
His likes and dislikes are few 
and far between but are definite 
enough to warrant mention. His 
special love is Texas and the wide 
open spaces; his special dish is 
apple pie; his dislike concerns
students cutting classes.
He became a member of Car
negie Techs faculty in 1920 when 
streetcars ran in front of Mar
garet Morrison College, when two 
weather-beaten old houses stood 
where the gym is now located, the 
Cut was a heap of stone and 
rubble, and the Recreation Cen
ter of the day was the renovated 
soldiers barracks, known to stu
dents of a few years ago as the 
Hut.
He is a member of Phi Kappa 
Phi, national scholastic honorary, 
the Physical Society of Pitts
burgh, and the American Associa
tion of Physics Teachers.
Professor Staley, as you prob
ably have heard from many of his 
students, is one of the most popu
lar and well-liked profs because 
of his pleasant disposition and 
friendly attitude. To sum up the 
students opinion of R. J. Staley 
in a few wordshes just an allaround good fellow.
Dinner Planned 
By Citmas Club
A dinner meeting of the Cit
mas Club will be held Monday, 
March 4, at 5:30 P. M. in the fac
ulty dining room, which adjoins 
Skibo.
The guest speaker for the af
fair will be Professor Sumner B. 
Ely, a former member of the Me
chanical Engineering Department 
at CIT, now Superintendent of 
the Smoke Prevention Bureau, 
Department of Health, Pittsburgh, 
Pa. Professor Elys message will 
be of vital interest to all, for his 
subject will be The Coming Con
trols for Smoke Prevention for 
the City of Pittsburgh and Alle
gheny County.
' Every member of Citmas Club 
is urged to make a special effort 
to be present, and an invitation 
is extended to all Master Masons 
in day or evening classes. If any 
new Master Masons have arriv
ed on the campus, they should 
send their names and addresses to 
Post Office Lock Box B, Carnegie 
Tech.
Tickets may be obtained from 
ticket salesmen, from Theodore 
Lampus, Cashiers Office, Admin
istration Hall, or from Mr. Don
ald D. Hazlett, Carnegie Institute 
Building.

This is the beginning of a series 
of columns that we hope to con
tinue each week. In it, we shall 
discuss different topics concerning 
the students and their lives here 
at Carnegie Tech. At times, were 
certain that there will be those of 
you who will disagree with, state
ments which appear herein. Always, we shall be willing to hear 
your arguments; and well proba
bly have plenty of answers. But 
if we can create some discussion 
on a few of the topics we cover, 
we shall- be happy.
Our first point is one that has 
been vaguely covered many times 
in the past with results that were 
just as vague. School spirit is 
dead at Carnegie Techwe need 
a revival of enthusiasm. The lack 
of substantial cheering at a Tech 
basketball game is a typical ex
ample of this. The turn-out of the 
games has been rather good, but 
this does not necessarily mean that 
Tech is supporting her team be
cause many of the seats are occu
pied by strangers and supporters 
of the opposing team. How many 
of you have seen a Tech game? 
Or perhaps we should ask, how 
many of you have not seen a Tech 
game?
Our first problem is to get the 
students to attend the game, but 
the next one is of even greater im
portancecheering for the glory 
of Carnegie. Have you ever real
ized that audible support can win 
or lose a game? Let the boys 
know youre backing them.
However, we need not limit our 
thoughts to this alone; for this 
lack of spirit is very evident else
where on the campus. For further 
discussion on this subject, follow 
this column weekly in the Car
negie TARTAN.
Before we close, we would like 
to present a few ideas that we 
hope will arouse some thought, 
discussion, and perhaps, a little 
action. First of all, many of the 
students are not acquainted with 
the Tech yells and songs. This is 
probably due to the irregularity of 
the enrollment at the present. 
Why cant these cheers be placed 
before the students on the bulletin 
boards or distributed in folder 
form? A page of the TARTAN 
might be employed once a semes
ter for this purpose. Another 
urgent need is for more pep rallies. 
The final suggestion will probably 
evoke howls from all corners of 
the Tech campus. We suggest that 
wherever possible, all Freshman 
and all pledges of both fraterni
ties and sororities should be re
quired to attend the more import
ant athletic activities. They 
should cheer loudly for the glory 
of Carnegie, and in doing so, they 
will help develop that spirit so 
necessary to the advancement of a 
great college.
So let us dig in, once again may 
Schenley Park resound with the 
waves of cheers and feel good 
spirits from the campus of dear 
old Tech.

Such is the task of those who 
would enter these here hallowed ' 
halls in the quest for knowledge! 
To add to the already general con
fusion we offer more confusion 
buildings! Take heart, it isnt half 
as confusing as it seems (it took 
me only two and a half years to 
find out that Maggie Murph was 
not a gym teacher). All one needs 
to get around the Tech campus is 
a map, a good compass (this 
should be a cinch to some of you 
Air Corps men), and a lot of good 
advice. To begin with, never ask 
a native for directions. Its em
barrassing, and besides they prob
ably dont know where Noble 
Scobell lives either.
For those Freshmen who dont 
know better, and who are perspir
ing young engineers, most classes 
will be in Industries Hall, the 
building with wings sticking out 
to the left and to the right and 
following the general contour of

how, is Administration Hall and 
here of course are located the Ad

the Cashiers officeopen during 
class hours and closed when you

Through out the rest of the 
building are clsssropms where 
you will tear your hair and chew 
your pencils in an effort to mas

Rel.
Engineering Hall, the building 
across from Industries is the home 
of the Sciences and the haven for 
future scientists. Here you will 
probably sleep through Chem lec
ture (no snoring, please) and 
spend weary hours in lab testing 
with the wrong reagents. Machin
ery Hall is the imposing building 
at the head of the quadrangle. It 
contains the Electrical and Me
chanical Engineering laboratories 
and lecture rooms and the schools 
power plant.
The next two buildings, Mar
garet Morrison and Fine Arts, are 
mostly interesting for their con
tentsgirls, of course. Here we 
find a strong mixture of coeds, 
architects, P & Ds, and dramats 
need we say more!
One could hardly end a tour of

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1946THE OARNEGIE TARTAN5
Intramural 
Roundup
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
Techs Mermen (theyll butcher me for that) having rested since 
the dawn of the new term will take to the H20 again this coming 
Saturday at home. Coach Risedorphs press agents tell me that the 
boys have really come a long way during their lay-off and will give 
a red-hot account of themselves. The gang has reaily been putting out 
in practice and the least we can do is lend a rooting section for the 
afternoon. See you there!
This weeks two-second biog
raphy of the Fearless Five entails 
the long and short of the life of 
Marty Chetlin (No. 4). Marty 
wasnt around when they passed 
out the height in the Chetlin fami
ly and tips the beam at 56 (rough 
approximation). But with his 
Adler Elevators, he towers above 
the crowd as an even 7. Chet is 
strictly a smog product, having 
entered the cruel world all the 
way out of East Pittsburgh. Mr. 
Chetlins favorite son having pro
gressed in his pursuit of a higher 
education as far as the 9th grade, 
went on to high-school, where he 
Utterly glittered on the basket
ball court (Hows that, Chet). All 
of which brought the mighty mite 
to Tech. The wee one has a lot 
of basketball sense and a lot
of drive, willing to do or die for 
the old Alma Mater. He poured 
through 8 points in the final quar
ter of the Geneva game last week, 
but, alas, in vain. Marty is one 
of the main attractions when the 
team travels what with his knowl
edge of old time songs and the 
radio commercials. Although he 
is the quiet type, hes definitely 
one who adds a great deal to the 
Carnegie squad and will bear 
watching as the seasons roll by.
Seems as though Techs basketeers are too gentlemanly about 
the whole affair. Every game for 
the past two months or so, the 
Skibos have taken an early lead, 
only to relinquish it in the course 
of events. They always start the 
second half like a house-afire, 
too, but cool off just when the 
opposition is a'bout to holler 
Uncle. It must be the morphine 
they get during the intermissions. 
(If the guys mothers are pres
ent, Im only kiddin.)
Westminster Trounces 
Tartan Quint By 67-45
Well, it was a nice trip. Thats about all that could be 
said about the ball game with Westminsters high-flying Titans 
last Saturday night. The Tartans were the second victims of 
Westminsters campaign to trample the two teams from the fair 
metropolis of Pittsburgh in one week. Pitt was the first to fall 
as they were knocked out of second place in the district standings 
by the Titans last Wednesday.
Carnegie couldnt cope with their 
taller rivals and came home nurs
ing a 67-45 bruise.
Playing on Westminsters small 
floor didnt seem to bother the vis
itors as they stepped out in front 
in the early stages of the game, 
but the home team, using their 
usual full-court man to man de
fense soon caught fire and beat the 
Tech defense time and again with 
fast breaks to pile up a decisive 
21-10 advantage at the quarter.
Westminster Controls Backboards
To make things worse for the 
Skibos, Westminster controlled 
both backboards and continued 
merrily on their way during the 
second period with the locals 
scarcely able to do anything about 
it. As the boys walked off the 
floor to get away from the deluge, 
the scoreboard showed Westmins
ter 37-18.
Tartans Switch To Zone
Red Silverman, from the looks 
of things, must have had plenty 
to say during the intermission, for 
the Tartans switched from a man 
to man to a zone defense and held
the opponents at bay while they 
rolled up a string of points. Howie 
Levy led the onslaught which 
threatened to make a ball game of 
the affair, but the Titans finally 
solved the problem and ran wild 
to wind up on top, 67-45.
Sidelights on the Game:
Levy, with 7 field goals and 4 
fouls, led both teams in the s?r-ring department with 18 po?"tHuddleton of Westminster r - e 
next with 13.
Dembinski, the lanky Titan - 
ter almost beat Tech single-b r- '- 
ed in their first encounter. The 
Skibos held him in check S ; - 
day, though, and The Lean On? 
was only able to get one field goi'.I 
and total five points.

An invitation to all college stu
dents to participate in the selec
tion of the players for the EastWest All-Star basketball game to 
be played at Madison Square Gar
den on March 30 is being issued 
through the sports editors of cam
pus newspapers. The game, the 
first of its kind in the history of 
basketball, is being played for the 
benefit of the New York Herald 
Tribune Fresh Air Fund which 
provides summer and Christmas 
vacations for thousands of New 
Yorks underprivileged children.
Each college student is eligible 
to submit his or her dhoice of the 
ten best college players in their 
sectionEast and West. Only one 
of the ten nominations may be 
from the students own campus; 
nine must be from other schools. 
All ten must be from one section, 
East or West.
The nominations by East-West 
college students will aid the 
judges in making their decisions 
as to which players to choose 
from among athletes with similar 
records. The Sports Editors of 
the Herald Tribune are not in
terested in the fact that a certain 
player happens to possess the pro
file of Van Johnson. They want to 
know which players you prefer 
as judged by the quality of their
Golf, Tennis On 
Spring Calendar
Athletic Director, Clarence Ov
erend, reports that the prospect 
of varsity tennis and golf for this 
spring looks very promising.
Five schools in this district are 
definitely going to play tennis this 
spring. Four other schools are not 
sure yet but probably will play. 
These facts present a very prom
ising outlook for the racket-swingers.
Oil Your Putters
Four schools, Allegheny, Grove 
City, Geneva, and Slippery Rock, 
are definitely going to play golf 
this year. There is no doubt that 
there will be a golf team this 
spring. The season will be short, 
three to four weeks. The mashieWielders will probably begin 
blasting about the middle of April,
playing. Due public recognition 
will be given to the student bodies 
turning in the highest mathemati
cal average of the players finally 
chosen for the East-West game.
Ten players are to be selected 
by the judges from the West and 
ten from the East. The teams will 
typify the 'best basketball played 
in these regions. For the purpose 
of this years game, ideas of where 
the East ends and the West be
gins will have to undergo some 
readjustment. To the basketball 
world the boundary line is the 
Alleghenies. The Eastern players 
will be the best on the Atlantic 
seaboard states. The West team 
will have the rest of the country 
from w<hich to choose.
Each college student is request
ed to name his choice of ten play
ers from his section of the coun
tryEast or West on the entry 
blank. The names of the ten play
ers should be typewritten or 
printed with the school of the 
player following his name. The 
student must sign the entry and 
list the college he is attending 
with his personal address. All en
tries must be postmarked by 
March 15. Final selection of the 
two teams will be made by the 
Sports Staff of the New York 
Herald Tribune on the basis of a 
players record  combined with 
the preferences of the student 
basketball fans from the East and 
West.
See ballot on page 3.
Last week saw more teams in 
play than any time since the pre
war heyday of intramural sports 
on Techs campus. With thirteen 
teams taking to the gym floor in 
the first week of basketball and 
twelve more finishing the second 
round on the Craig St. alleys, 
Coach Risedorph is looking for a 
secretary to help him with all his 
bookkeeping.
Tau Delts, Phi Kaps Forfeit
An Intramural Board ruling 
changed last weeks bowling setup 
in League I by making the Tau 
Delts and Phi Kaps forfeit the two 
games they had won with ineligi
ble men. The loss will not hurt 
the Tau Delts very much, but it 
knocked the Phi Kaps right out of 
a first place tie with DUs. It was 
a great help to the boys from Scobell Hall, however, as it gave them 
an artificial position at the top of 
the column.
D. Us Lead In Bowling
Bob Hanovers boys from Delta 
Upsilon continued to set the pace 
as they took three straight games 
by margins of a hundred points or 
better from the Tau Delts. Mean
while Scobell Hall, feeling good 
after their two-game gift, made it 
two more while dropping one to 
the SAEs. Scobells Snoyer won 
top honors for his one-game high 
of 226. The Phi Kaps had an easy 
day as they set the Zetas down 
for three losses with hardly a 
fight.
League II Tied Up
Over in League II, where there 
are fewer intramural rulings and 
a little more real competitive 
bowling, it is still anybodys con
test. The PiKAs, Beta Sigs, and 
TXs are all tied up for first with 
four wins and two losses apiece. 
The Delts, Welch Hall, and the 
Citcom Clan are bunched close be
hind with two games won or lost 
making the difference.
Lou Umbach Has High Score
The TXs, paced by Lou Umbachs league high of 224, stayed in 
the race by trimming the PiKAs 
for two out of three. Umbachs 
525 was the best three game total 
recorded. Despite their definite 
superiority, the Beta Sigs cannot 
seem to click. For the second 
week in a row they have faltered 
long enough to drop one of their 
three conteststhis time it was to 
the Citcom Clan by a slim margin 
of three pins. Welch Hall pulled 
out of the cellar by winning a pair 
from the Delts.
The season is still too young to 
give anything but the scores in 
basketball. A number of teams 
have yet to hit their stride, while 
others may have had a few open
ing game breaks. But with six 
games in each league that still 
leaves plenty to talk about.
Phi Kaps Take Two
In League I the Phi Kaps were 
off to a good start as they dropped 
the TXs 23-11 and the DUs 21-17. 
The TNTs sure looked like they 
were loaded with it when they 
out scored Scobell Hall 50-43 in 
what was by far the best battle 
of the week. Gleason for the win
ners and Locke for the losers set 
sharp paces as they hit the hoops 
for 21 points apiece. But things 
were not quite as good for the 
TNTs in the DU game. It was 
only a matter of a couple of foul 
shots which made the margin of 
victory for the TNTs in a tight 
31-29 ballgame. The PiKAs 
trounced Scobell Hall 31-15 and 
the TXs nosed out the independ
ent BBAs 27-26 in the other two 
contests.
Betas, S. A. E.s Show form
The Betas and SAEs displayed 
some potentialities over in the 
other league as the boys from sec
tion 7-B found themselves on the 
losing end of 46-31 and 42-22 
scores. The Betas also set down 
the Dorm Combine 36-33 while the 
SAEs toppled the Delts 42-30. 
The Tau Delts had little competi
tion as they took the Delts 19-12 
in a slow game which saw the 
Delts make but one field goal all 
evening.
Future Flashes 
Asked To Report
If you can run, jump, hurdle, 
or are in any way athletically 
inclined, sign up immediately for 
the Tech Track Team. Yes, Techs 
definitely going to have a team 
this year; meets have already 
been scheduled beginning April 
27 and lasting till May 18. This 
closing date is necessary to allow 
plenty of time for final exams. 
Practice will begin sometime 
around March 15, or at least as 
soon as the weather is such that 
the team doesnt sink in the mud 
farther than their ankles. Coach 
Guy Halferty, cross-country and 
track coach at CIT in pre-war 
days, announces that the teams 
prospects look very good, for not 
only are there thirty-three men 
listed already, but also this 
springs meets will see the par
ticipation of such favorites as 
Bob Kindi in the 440.
Anyone who is interested in 
holding a managerial position and 
who has not already turned in 
his name, should do so at once.
Case Swimmers 
Invade Saturdav
Carnegie Techs varsity swim
ming team will resume its sea
son this Saturday against Case 
in the Tech Pool. The meeting is 
scheduled to start at two oclock. 
The admission is free. Coach A.
E. Risedorph feels that the boys 
have a better than even chance 
of emerging victors in this con
test. The two teams have met 
previously, the Clevelanders com
ing out on top by the score of 
48-27. It was very noticeable at 
this time that had Tech been able 
to field a better relay team or 
sprint men, the score would have 
turned around. Since this meet, 
Case has had the misfortune of 
losing its entire compliment of 
V-12 boys, which wTere the main 
stay of the team. Tedi has also 
been able to have more practice 
which, considering the fact that 
the Tech team is comprised of 
mostly first year men means more 
experience, a necessity. Coach 
Risedorph feels that the Tech 
team will display its best form 
of the year. If you want to see 
what speed swimming is like, 
come over to the gym on Satur
day afternoon. To repeat, the ad
mission is free. Lets have a good 
representation of the student 
body. If the Tech students ex
pect to have good athletics, they 
will have to show'interest in them.
WAA Revises 
Point System
The Womens Athletic Associa
tion has changed the point system 
for athletic awards. The num
bers of hours are the same: 30 for 
numerals, 90 for sweater, and 120 
for CY but at least 50% of these 
hours must be earned in schedul
ed activities. Scheduled activities 
include basketball, modern dance, 
volleyball, badminton tourna
ments and table tennis tourna
ments, and Wednesday night 
swimming. Regular gym classes 
are scheduled activities, but WAA 
credit can be given for them only 
when regular gym credit is not 
given. Unscheduled activities are 
table tennis and badminton not 
played in the tournaments and 
any sport not assigned for a cer
tain time.
Credit For Riding, Bowling
Sheets will be posted in the ta
ble tennis room and in the wom
ens gym on which to sign up for 
WAA hours spent, so that hours 
may be earned only on campus. 
Credit for bowling and riding will 
be given if taken with a regular 
gym class.
The purpose of this change in 
system is to keep Letter check on 
WAA hours and to prevent the 
awarding of a letter to a minor 
sport such as table tennis.
Sports recognized by WAA are: 
basketball, volleyball, contempor
ary dance, badminton, tennis, ta
ble tennis, swimming, hockey, 
mushball, riding, archery and 
bowling.
AH Women Eligible
All women are eligible for par
ticipation in the Womens Ath
letic Association. Basketball prac
tices are held Wednesdays at 3:30 
and Fridays at 4.30. The swim
ming pool is open Wednesday 
evenings.
The schedules for volleyball, 
badminton and table tennis will 
be announced later.

isnt his autobiography either!)

Shout One is for the heads of 
the Beaux Arts Committee for

Arts Ball. One deep salaam to 
Lakowski and Yurchison. Shout 
Two is for The Late George 
Apley and for that one scene 
especially when Thanksgiving din
ner was over and the cast had 
eaten too much. Shout Three is for 
all the people who helped out 
in the Beanery and Skiboduring 
the recent strike and for all the 
automobile drivers who were kind 
enough to stop and give commutAssociated Artists
[continued from page 2] 
sented in the oil group include 
William Charles Libby, who inter
prets merry-go-round horses as 
animals alive and wild, running 
free between rides; Raymond Simboli, who also paints horses in a 
gay fantastic way; Norwood MacGilvany, who entered a portrait of 
Mrs. Florence Fisher Parry; and 
Robert E. Doherty.
White House and Red Barn 
by Esther Topp Edmunds of the 
P and D department is a fresh, 
colorful landscape, far superior to 
most of the landscapes in the 
show.
The watercolor and abstract 
rooms are gay and more inspir
ing. Most memorable in the wa
tercolor groups is C. Kermit 
Ewings Storm a Brewin. Mr. 
Ewing was also represented in the 
oil group by two expressive 
paintings. John D. Clarksons Col
orful Houses in the Colored Dis
trict is very gay. It is a wet 
splashing watercolor, free in 
method, and also night-marish 
in its fantastic color. In contrast 
to the latter is Marie Louise Rit
ters Sediments of the Past. The 
combination and contrast of deep 
red washes of color and tall, lacy 
delicate trees is intriging in its 
sensory approach. The two ab
stracts by Balcomb Green and 
those toy Russell Twiggs stand out 
among the others. Mr. Twiggs 
The First Lesson and Time Meter 
are also an architectural relief, 
They are illusionary, creative, 
special, and precise in interpreta
tion. View From Train Window 
by Irene Waichler has a kind of 
amusing quality. It is suggestive 
of space, a looking out, and a 
movement of passive things, 
wires, and tall shapes.
Most of the sculpture pieces 
were monumental in interpreta
tion. What Does It Profit Man 
portrays well a disconcerted char
acter. Also impressive is Patricia 
Formleys pensive seated figure, 
Deep Thought which was award
ed the Society of Sculptors prize.
Although Henry Bursztynowicz 
received the Sauereisen first 
award for ceramics, his glazes 
seemed to be rather experimental 
in character as compared to the 
deep range of hues, characteristic 
of Virgil Cantinis work.
The craft group displayed sev
eral examples of beautiful work
manship. Agnes Bittaker exhibit
ed many good-looking silver 
pieces. The Vernon - Benshoff 
award went to Claude Jenson for 
a silver pina fish mounted on a 
silver platewell made, but not 
too interesting in design.
Two of the small number of 
gold pieces exhibited were entered 
by Frederic C. Clayton of the P. 
& D. Department. He exhibited 
tv o rings, intricate in design, ex
amples of very skillful workman
ship.
The exhibit is in the third floor 
galleries of Carnegie Institute and 
will continue through March 14.

Four Burps to the Breeze 
Department:
Burp One is for the poor pub
licity given the recitals by the 
Music Department. A lot of people 
would really like to go IF they 
knew when and where they were. 
Burp Two is for the anonymous 
person who wrote A Fruedulent 
Subject in the last issue of the 
Scottie. And come to think of it, 
that anonymous idea was prob
ably the best one that person ever 
had. Burp Three is still for the 
overcrowded Skibo and Beanery 
at 12:30  CANT anything be 
done about it? Burp Four is for 
that stupid announcer (Davey) 
on the 6 to 8 Special every

pletely fascinating. We couldnt 
get interested in the new novel 
by Erich Maria Remarque called 
Arch of Triumph but everyone 
else seems to like it. And if you 
like Angela Thirkell, be sure and 
read her new Miss Bunting 
which is entirely too reminiscent 
of that awful book by Marjory 
Sharp, Cluny Brown, for me to 
like. There is an excellent new 
book out called In the Blazing 
Light, by Max White, about the 
painter Goya and his celebrated 
love affair w7ith the Duchess of 
Alba, (note to stamp collectors: 
She is the woman on THO'SE 
Spanish stamps who w?as aware of 
the clothing shortage even in the 
eighteenth century.) The End Man 
is looking forward to reading the 
George Washington Carver

new novel called Mrs. Palmers 
Honey. Another bit of real in
teresting reading can be found in 
The Ciano Diaries by Musso
linis Boy Friday. Washington 
Tapestry, by Mrs. Raymond 
Clapper, is another delightful bit 
of reading and of course, The Egg 
and I, by Betty MacDonald, is 
something you should not miss. 
Dont overlook Louis Slobodkins 
Focastle Waltz and Martha Albrands Remember Anger. And 
if you havent read Daphne du 
Mauriers The King's General, 
or Errol Flynns Showdown, or 
The Black Rose by Thomas, B.

His Tail by Hobart, please dont 
feel badly. They arent worth the

Electrical Engineers 
Visit Signal Company
On Tuesday, February 19, AIEE 
took a field trip to the Union 
Switch and Signal Company at 
Swissvale. There the members 
were taken oh especially conduct

shown various methods of signal

facturing different kinds of sig

Everyone has heard that men 
are partial to blonds, and after 
seeing Ann Sweeney you can tell 
why. Our beautiful blonde blue
eyed Ann is known for her strik
ing appearance which won her 
honors as one of this years This
tle Queens. Even though men are 
partial to her, she has her own 
ideas about them, and as she ex
pressed it, They should be over 
20 and terrific. But Ann has not 
become one of the campus favor
ites just on her appearance, for 
she has shown herself to be a 
very capable and hard worker. 
Even as a freshman, she proved 
herself worthy of responsibility 
by working on the Spring Car
nival Committee. This semester
4R.iss and Tell Given 
At Pgh. Playhouse
Frederick Burleigh will direct 
the comedy, Kiss and Tell, which 
opens at the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
on March 1. This is Burleighs 
first production following his re
turn to the Pittsburgh theater 
after three and a half years in 
the army.
Kiss and Tell is the comedy 
concerning a fifteen-year old girl 
whose adolescent behavior leaves 
her family about as jittery as it 
would be with a time bomb in 
the cellar. There is never any 
telling what the young lady, Cor
liss Archer, will do; but when 
she does it, it creates a situation 
taking a whole evening to 
straighten out. Sally Kettles plays 
the part in the Playhouse produc
tion.
Kiss and Tell will be on at 
the Playhouse for twenty per
formances, the last of which is on 
March 23.
Girls
she has reached the top on the 
Scottie, for she is now Editor-inChief. She has worked for the 
Scottie since her freshman year 
and was managing-editor just 
prior to becoming editor. She has 
also worked on the Thistle and 
was made a member of Pi Delta 
Epsilon for her active participa
tion in journalism at Tech. She 
has been a member of Womens 
Guild for the past four years. She 
has also been a member of Kappa 
Kappa Gamma fraternity, (acting 
as membership chairman this 
year), and treasurer of Mortar 
Board, senior womens honorary.
Ann has not only found 
time for many activities, but 
also varied pastimes such as 
painting, writing, dancing, and 
playing bridge. Being an English 
Major in Maggie Murph, she 
naturally loves journalism, and 
playing bridge is a natural instinct 
for such an enthusiastic Techite 
as Ann. Tech really rates high 
with her, and she hates the 
thought of graduating. However, 
another place ranks close to Tech, 
and thats New York City, which 
she has had the opportunity to 
visit five times in the past two 
years. After she graduates, she 
wants to take a long trip before 
going into the advertising field, 
and New York City will probably 
be on her list of places to visit. 
She has many other likes besides 
New York City, for instance: 
chocolate mint sundaes, all kinds 
of music with Vaughn Monroe 
as her favorite orchestra leader, 
the color blue, and a red car. She 
also thought one of her most un
usual experiences at school was 
when she passed physics.
Because she has given so much 
to Tech including her loyalty, 
sweet, sparkling, vivacious Ann 
will be missed by everyone after

On Wednesday, February 27, 
from 4 to 6 p. m Student Council 
will hold an all-school tea dance 
in Thistle Hall. Tickets are only 
twenty-five cents for this strictly 
stag affair at which Bob Kelly 
(M 46) and his orchestra will

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
One of the Boys
SH> BERKOWITZ
Sid (or Earl Sidney as his fa
ther remarked to the nurse when 
she brought him the good news 
that it was a boy) Berkowitz is 
getting to be quite a campus tra
dition; and since One of the 
Boys is usually the story of such 
a person, here goes.
Well, Sid (I dare not call him 
Earl) was bred, bom, and raised 
in the quaint little town of Salem, 
Massachusetts. Y ou certainly 
have heard of Salemthey burn
ed witches there. Berkowitz, how
ever, survived; and in September, 
1941 he entered Carnegie Tech. 
Neither he nor I can figure out 
why.
After I tell you of the varied 
things he plans to do after leaving 
our hallowed campus, you too 
will probably begin to wonder. At 
first he wants to tour the country 
and then the world. After that, 
he may go out to Sans Springs 
Ranch in Idaho and raise cattle, 
though concerning this occupa
tion he defiantly said, I dont 
want to be a cowboy. (After all 
you must consider the horse you 
know.) As a last resort, he may 
enter the liquor business. Now 
does that sound like a mechanical 
engineering talking.
Anyway we are glad Sid de
cided to come to Tech because he 
would foe a welcome addition to 
any campus. To prove his popu
larity, he is Chancellor of Beta 
Sigma Rho fraternity, having 
previously held the offices of 
Warden and Auditor. Sid is also a 
member of the American So
ciety of Mechanical Engineers. He 
was a member of Interfraternity 
Council and on the Scottie Staff.
Here and There

papers, but grades them by plac
ing them on a scale and weighing 
them. He inserted the following 
note in the middle of his paper: 
If you read this far, I will buy 
you a coke.
The rush of veterans to the 
campus is threatening to strain 
the capacities of scores of Amer
ican Colleges and Universities. 
Some 4,000 of them have enroll
ed for the winter quarter at the 
University of Minnesota, and the 
Spring quarter is expected to see 
a substantial increase in that fig
ure. The story is much the same 
everywhere. On December 1, 
there was an overall veteran en
rollment in the country of 125,000 
which may soar to 600,000 by 
next fall. It was originally 
thought that 2,000,000 GIs might 
return as students on some level 
of education  college or other
wise but now Dr. Francis J. 
Brown, of the American Council 
of Education, doubles that esti
mate. What this adds up to is a 
testing time for American Schools 
such as they have never experi
enced, a tremendous piling up of 
demand against their limited plant 
and teaching resources. The adjust
ment will be difficult but no one 
will begrudge the opportunities 
for continued education which he 
has seized upon so eagerly. The 
people will have to reconcile 
themselves, though, to heavy new 
investments in the schools.
As to likes and dislikes, his 
are certainly down pat. He dis
likes people who have no school 
spirit, those who name the Bean
ery Skibo, and Clara Herron (In 
fact one of Sids milder and more 
innocent .pastimes is jumping 
upon said Herron after each edi
tion of the Tartan comes out.) 
Anyway he likes food, the thea
ter, food, classical records, food, 
the Playhouse Bar, and, of all 
things, food.
Sid alsb has a couple of favor
ite beliefs. They are that frosh 
regulations are a wonderful thing 
and that a fraternity can do much 
for all of its members.
About movies, Sid just says he 
loves them, all and every one. 
(ED. Selective, isnt he?)
Many people doubt that Sid has 
a serious side because he is al
ways so full of fun, laughing, and 
kidding with everyone; neverthe
less Sid is serious at times, he be
lieves that there should be a stu
dent on the Board of Admissions 
at C. I. T., and hed like to see 
more Negro Students at Tech.
About his love life he refuses 
to say anything, but as far as 
one can see, he is playing the 
field. (How about a nice AEPhi 
Sid old Chum?)
To try to summarize him is as 
difficult as trying to force a size 
four shoe on a girl who wears 
a size nine. It just cant be done. 
Sid is kind, perpetually cheerful, 
and has a jovial personality. His 
generosity is easily remembered 
by the many students who bor
rowed his car, Bessie. All in all, 
Sid Berkowitz IS One of the 
Boys.
Tartan Reporter Interviews 
Noble Scobelite Slim Langdon
Momma, poppa, sister, and the 
fellers call him Slim. You know 
how it is, though! The registrar 
insists its Maurice Clayton Lang
don. So we present Slim to the 
gang, and (hum) the other to 
registrars in general.
Slim is six foot six inches short, 
one-hundred eighty-five pounds 
light, and when a reporter drew 
forth a measuring tape to go into 
further details, the man in ques
tion insisted the desk remain be
tween them. Well, its probably 
the strict Army Air Force Train
ing coming into play. (Slim is an 
army man from way back in 1944 
did a bit of Staff Sergeanting in 
his day. But he had to give it all 
up to become an Irregular Sopho
more in the Electrical Engineer
ing Department.
Slim has been out of the Army 
since 1944. He completed his 
Freshman year at Lawrence Insti
tute of Technology in his home 
town of Detroit, Michigan.
He was president of Scobel Hall 
last semester, a worker on the 
Tartan, and a member of the So
cial, Grievance, and Orientation 
committees of the Tech Vets. As a 
school, he likes Tech but doesnt 
like the way some things are done, 
his pet peeve being the fact that 
the male dormitory students must 
eat all their meals in Skibo while 
the school provides meals included 
in the dormitory fee for the girls. 
He didnt just gripe about this, 
either, but set out to collect a lot 
of names on a petitiona petition 
which suffered much the same fate 
as many another.

ternities on campusJust ask us

reel off their escapades for the 
King of Hearts campaign. They 
really hit the nail on the head! 
Thats what we call school spirit 
and campus life.One dozen forA rather lamentable state of af
fairs is reported to exist at Hart
ford. That city is investigating 
the problem of Rude Ladies on 
Public Conveyances. It seems 
that a street car starts off down 
the street having within ten la
dies on one side sitting closely, 
yet comfortably together and ten 
men on the opposite side. Present
ly one lady gets out; the other 
nine unconsciously rise a trifle, 
shake their skirts, and the seat 
is full again. This process con
tinues until there are only seven 
women, who by the same sort of 
spreading still manage to com
pletely fill the seat. Now enters 
a lady. On the ladies side there 
are three persons less than when 
the car started, yet not one of 
the seven remaining moves. And 
so one of the men on the opposite 
side gives his seat to the new
comer and stands during the rest 
of the journey.
Here is an interesting Pitts
burgh corollary to this same situ
ation, and one that is just as bad. 
A gentleman has been seen to 
give a womanshe could not be 
called a ladya seat on a bus. 
Presently the person next to her 
would leave. Instead of asking 
the gentleman who was so polite 
to her to take the vacant seat, 
she gently spreads her skirts over 
the place and leaves him stand
ing. There is some satisfaction de
rived from knowing that the 
thing begins to react, and ladies 
do not find the gentlemen quite 
as complaisant as they were.

The Carnegie Plaid
Published by the Studentsc of Carnegie Tech Night School
Evening Students to Swim 
In Gym Pool on March 2
Its always the last issue before 
an affair thats the toughest to 
write; particularly if the activi
ties pertaining to the affair are 
limited. But somehow I dont find 
myself in that boat tonight writ
ing about the Swimming Party 
which is to be held this com
ing Saturday Evening, March 2, 
in the Carnegie Gymnasium. 
First, describing the pool itself 
would require plenty of space but 
then it will be enough to say that 
it is one of the finest pools in the 
city and anyone that loves water 
can have himself a pleasant time, 
either swimming, diving or just 
messing around (pardon the 
slang) in the shallow end of the 
pool. By the way if there hap
pens to be an inflatable rubber 
ball (the bigger the better) ly
ing around the house, bring it 
along to the party. Tossing a ball 
around the pool can prove to be 
loads of fun especially if youre 
on the tossing end, but, girls, dont 
get the idea that we will allow 
such shenanigans to take place. For 
those who will care to exert some 
real energy, water polo will give 
them plenty of opportunity to do 
so. Now we dont want to give 
the impression that only those 
nersnns who are good swimmers 
fun at the party 
imittee in charge 
nds to see to it
_______ present will get
into the fun. We might add that 
there will be a lifeguard at the pool 
to make sure that there are no 
mishaps and Im sure he will also 
be willing to give the novice 
swimmer a few good pointers in 
the art of swimming. Another 
thing to remember is that this 
party is not limited only to even
ing students but also to friends of 
the students, so bring all your 
friends and be assured of a good 
time.
Now that Im writing my clos
ing paragraph I might add that 
the price will be 35c to be paid 
at the door. In case I havent 
mentioned it before the party is 
to be held Saturday Evening, 
March 2. (9 to 12).
Letter to the Editor
Thanks a million for the infor
mation about the study room in 
Industries Hall! Its good to know 
about the places that are not 
familiar to the average student. 
After reading about the room, I 
decided to have a look at it after 
class. I was pleasantly surprised 
to find several other Techites there, 
end we had quite a lively gab ses
sion as we patiently waited for our 
rides' to show up.
Another evening I browsed. 
around the library on the second 
floor where there was an ample 
supply of current popular maga
zines that immediately took my 
fancy. (This doesnt sound as 
though I ever study, but, honestly,
I domostly at the end of the
semester!]
And just one more thing, dear
editor. 1Lts take action on a
suggestioni made in a recent letter

Plaid readers. Im just an eager 
beaver tonite. Ive got so much 
to spill, my cup of knowledge

(but not vaguely discontented) 
sporting a handsome diamond,

Notice to Veterans
A bulletin board has been placed 
outside of Room 155 on the first 
floor of Industries Hall for posting 
notices for veterans. All veterans 
are requested to refer to this bul
letin board at frequent intervals 
as the Veterans Center will use 
this means of contacting veterans.
This and That
Maybe we do need, above all, 
a good five cent cigar, but I know 
a lot of fellows who would set
tle for any old BUTT at the pres
ent time. We could also use, if it 
is possiblea clear, consistent labor-management policy by our 
government in Washington. And, 
while we are at it, we would add 
a n intelligent, comprehensible 
price- administration program, 
based, not on political pressure 
groups, but on the economic needs 
of the country. Although Nero 
may have played the fiddle while 
Rome burned, I diont see why we 
should permit some of our es
teemed senators to Fiddle-play 
while our country SLEEPS  
sleeps a very troubled sleep be
cause of ineffective, selfish legis
lation.
Plaque Awarded To 
Outstanding Eve Grad
The Evening Student Council is 
making arrangements to give an 
award to the outstanding graduate 
of the Evening School classes. The 
student who is selected will have 
his or her name engraved on a 
plaque which will be placed in one 
of the buildings, a key engraved 
with the students name, and also 
a certificate stating the basis of 
the award.
Each year the candidates for the 
Bachelors Degree from the Even
ing School will be considered for 
this award. Their scholastic and 
activity records will be examined 
in relation to their personal traits 
and charcteristics and the type, as 
well as responsibilities, of their 
employment. The length of time 
in which they completed the re
quirements for their degrees, the 
promise which they show for fu
ture success, and the extent to 
which they participate in the ac
tivities of campus or non-campus 
professional or technical societies 
in their field of study are other 
factors that will be considered. If 
in the opinion of the examining 
committee none of the candidates 
for the award meets the standards 
of the award, it will not be given.
The recipient of this award will 
be selected by the Evening School 
Student Council from candidates 
recommended by a committee con
sisting of the Supervisor of Even
ing Classes, the Assistant Regis
trar, and additional committee 
members selected by them.
Editorial
[continued from page 2]
Since nothing can really be 
done at this late date either about 
the men selected for ODK or 
about those selected for Scimitars 
and Delta Skulls, it may seem 
useless to bring up the matter. 
However, we feel that general 
campus knowledge of all the er
rors made in the present elections 
may serve to awake the present 
members of these honoraries to 
the responsibility they bear for 
rectifying the errors that have 
been made and seeing that the 
members elected in the future are 
selected on a basis entirely above ' 
reproach, and with the thought 
in mind of creating and main
taining the high standards on 
whioh these organizations were 
intended to be founded.

Banquet News
The souvenirs are flowing in 
for another successful banquet 
this year at the Roosevelt Hotel, 
Saturday evening, April 27th. The 
interest shown in this years ban
quet forecasts a very good attend
ance again at this outstanding 
function of the evening school. 
Two very interesting speakers 
have been secured for the even
ing; we feel certain that they 
both will prove very interesting 
to every person present.
In order to secure a good dis
tribution of tickets for this years 
Engineers Banquet, the commit
tee is requesting help from all 
fellow students. The committee 
feels that more of the older even
ing school veterans should be con
tacted on this annual affair for in 
this way we can bring about an 
annual reunion of Tech men, 
something that is decidely lacking 
at the present. It is our desire 
that we have a good representa
tion from all evening groups: 
Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, 
Chemical, Management and Met
allurgical.
Idle Daydreams
Funny how one sunny day, 
even in the middle of winter, 
makes a fellow think about the 
old golf sticks. Recalling fond 
memories of the old divot dig
gers, which now are lying in the 
darkest corner of the closet, he 
mentally caresses the putter and 
silently pleads with the old cam
paigner to be kind to him this 
coming season, which at the mo
ment seems only days away. By 
now I suppose you more rational 
readers know that this writer is 
an incurable turfusurper, but then 
I realize that those outside of the 
great brotherhood of mashiewielders just dont understand 
what makes a golfbug tick and 
just what the game means to the 
incurables. So with your permis
sion, Ill try to explain the game 
and its merits so that you will 
look down on us with more con
tempt and less sympathy.
Golf is a form of work made 
easy by the fact that you can 
use it as an excuse to keep from 
doing something more menial. 
Golf is what letter carrying, ditchdigging, and carpet beating would 
be if those tasks had to be per
formed on the same afternoon in 
short pants and colored socks by 
gouty-looking gentlemen who re
quire a different implement for 
every mood.
Golf seems to be the most sim
ple game in the world when you 
decide to take it up and the hard
est after you have played for ten 
or twelve years. It is probably the 
only known game a man can play 
as long as a quarter of a century 
and then discover that it was too* 
deep for him in the first place.
A golf course has eighteen 
holes, some players insist on 
playing nineteen holes, but the 
more legitimate followers of the 
game say that eighteen holes are 
more than enough to task a mans 
ability. A hole is a tin cup in 
the center of the green. A 
green is a small parcel of grass 
an expensive parcel we might 
add, which costs about $1.98 per 
blade and is usually located be
tween a brook, a couple of trees, 
or a lot of unfinished excavation. 
The idea is to get the ball from 
a given point into each cup in the 
fewest strokes and the fewest 
words. After each hole has been 
completed, the golfer counts his 
strokes, subtracts six and says 
*Mfcde it in five, one over par. 
After the final or eighteenth hole, 
the golfer adds his score but
Interviewing
Star light!
Star light!
First fellow we spot in sight,
We will interview for our column 
tonight.
Thats exactly what we did this 
evening, and our captive was none 
other than Robert Burkey, from 
Wilkinsburg.
Bob was quite shy, and very re
luctant to submitting to this inter
view, but he finally consented.
He is a veteran of World War
II, and has served three years in 
the European Theatre with the 
Medical Corps.
When asked if he had a hobby 
his reply was, Adjusting myself 
to the trials and tribulations of the 
woes of being a civilian again.
Bob works for the Westinghouse 
Air Brake, and manages to make 
three trips out to Tech each week. 
This is his first semester and his 
subjects are Engineering Drawing, 
Algebra, and Geometry.
This newcomer to the Tech 
campus is 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 
weights 160 pounds, has green 
eyes, brown wavy hair, and a very 
pleasing smile. He has a very 
nice complexion especially when 
he blushes. Being that his favor
ite color is red, might have some
thing to do with it?
Bob is a very likable person, 
and were sure he wont have any 
difficulty making friends in his 
new surroundings. Heres wish
ing that your nightschool days 
prove more enjoyable as each 
exam rolls by.
First Impressions of An 
Evening School Student
First impressions arent always 
the best ones. Enlarge upon them 
and make up your mind when you 
register that youll enjoy those 
classes at Tech. That first walk 
across the long, long trail awinding, that is more commonly known 
as the cut, was one a poor phy
sical wreck of a night school stu
dent will never forget. Its a 
beautiful walk and one needs the 
exercise and one ought to appre
ciate the finer things in nature; 
but as the campus walk continues 
and forks off here and there, too 
often these finer things are for
gotten under the physical and 
mental strain.
Trying to find the correct room 
suddenly becomes a problem that 
needs a special course in explora
tion. When the specified room is 
found, the bewildered beginner 
starts the long process of becoming 
an educated old-timer at Tech and 
take it from one who knows 
taint easy!
Taking it for granted that the 
professor is just what you ordered,
