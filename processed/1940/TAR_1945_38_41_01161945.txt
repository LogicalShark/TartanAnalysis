Carnegie Drops Hard Fought 
Games To Pitt & Penn State
Tartans Make Valiant Effort to Overcome 
Handicaps; Trample Juniata College, 56-31
Things went pretty well last Friday evening for about a quarter of 
the game, but then the lights went out. No, its not what youre thinking, 
but an expression to describe the awesome wrath of coach Lawthers 
monsters. After battling the taller Penn State boys to an 11-11 tie for the 
first quarter, our Tartans just fell apart at the seams. The half time showed 
State sporting a 28-16 yead, and the fearsome final was 57-22.
Maxies main problem was getting rebounds away from several 
rangy Penn States, and even Theodore and Scioscia together couldnt turn 
it. This control of the backboards was undoubtedly a great factor in the 
Tartan defeat, but the team generally was not up to snuff after the sensa
tional first quarter.
For a minute, it was like old times again. The reappearance of A1 
Minetti, class of 23, brought back memories, er somethin, For all the

to be followed in reaching a solu
tion.
In the preparation of the essay, 
careful attention should be given 
to the following: (a) clear state
ment of the problem; (b) presenta
tion of evidence to show that the 
problem exists and data relating to 
its analysis and solution; (c) analy

Seven Distinguished 
Scientists from India 
Visit Carnegie Tech
Carnegie Tech was honored dur
ing the week of December 18 by the 
presence of seven distinguished sci
entists from India. They have just 
completed a tour of Great Britain 
and are now making a six week tour 
of leading scientific centers in the 
United States, under the auspices 
of the National Research Committee 
and the State Department.
Their present schedule calls for 
visits in Pittsburgh, Knoxville, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, 
Boston, and several cities in Canada. 
Among the leading scientific cen
ters to be visited are Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, Mellon In
stitute, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Battelle Memorial, and 
TVA.
The men who are making this 
tour are the best known scientists 
of India. One director is Dr. Nazir 
Ahmad, of the Indian Central Cot
ton Committee and Technological 
Laboratory, whose special line of re
search is cotton technology. Other 
members of the committee include 
Sir Shanti Swamp Bhatnagar, direc
tor of Scientific and Industrial Re
search Directorate (Government of 
India); Sir Juan Chandra Ghosh, 
also a director and a member of the 
Indian Institute of Science; Profes
sor S. K. Mitra, Professor of Physics 
at Calcutta University, who was a

Tecvets Give Party 
For Delta Gammas
The discharged service men at 
Carnegie Tech, otherwise known as 
the Tecvets, are having a party 
for the Delta Gamma Sorority girls 
at Carnegie Union, Friday night, 
January 19 at 8:00. The entertain
ment planned for the evening will 
consist of dancing, pictures of the 
1939 Pitt-Tech football game in 
which Tech beat Pitt, bridge, re
freshments, etc.
The Tecvets is an organization 
composed of the discharged service 
men who have entered Tech in or
der to continue their education. 
Anyone who has an honorable dis
charge from the armed forces is eli
gible for membership. Some of the 
aims of the organization are to wel
come returning veterans and make 
them feel at home on the campus, 
and to promote fellowship on the 
campus. The Tecvets are planning 
an all-school dance sometime in 
March. The monthly meeting of the 
organization are held in the Union, 
the next meeting being on Febru
ary 9. Advisors to the organization 
are Professor Dawes, Dr. Gregg, and 
Mr. Belton, and the ex-officio offic
ers are Dean Daniels, Dr. Work and 
Major Boberg.'
Doctor Max Schoen 
Publishes Work On 
Aesthetics of Music
The noted author, Dr. Max 
Schoen has just completed a new 
book, The Understanding Of Music.
The Understanding of Music is es
sentially based on the esthetics of 
music, founded on esthetic theory in 
general and the psychology of music 
in particular. The first chapter, 
What Art Is, gives a foundation to 
the book by analyzing the nature 
and function of art as a whole. 
Chapters two and three examine the 
place of music among arts and the 
musical hearing of music. In his 
fourth and last chapter, Dr. Schoen 
investigates the possible methods of 
procedure for the cultivation of the 
esthetic response. Will Earhart, 
well-known musician, author, and 
editor sums up the book in these 
words: It is not too much to say 
that here is the, definitive book on 
musical esthetics.

THE CABNEG1E TARTANJANUARY 16, 1945
Freshman Regulations
Unlike most other colleges, Carnegie Tech enjoys very few activities 
outside of its basketball teamwhich tend to bring the students together 
in a common aim. We all realize that the war has been a major reason for 
this deficiency, but that is not sufficient reason for us to throw away all. 
the traditions which were once dear to all Tech students. The situation has 
reached a point at which only the present seniors have any recollection of 
the good old days.
Freshman regulations were always a major factor in what is now re
ferred to as the good old days. That, in itself, was one of the main rea
sons Interhonorary Council took it upon itself to bring these regulations 
back to our campus for the class about to enter in February. This, in an 
effort to instill badly needed school spirit in the entering students before 
all the students with any memory of past traditions shall have been grad
uated.
The idea of reinstating the regulations has met with much enthusiasm 
from all students who have any interest in school affairs. One objection 
took the form of the question, What about returning vets? The answer to 
that was a clause added to the rules which would excuse those vets who 
may not wish to cooperate with the plan. There was also some skepticism 
as to whether this was the time for any school to regiment (?) its incom
ing students. The word regiment apparently applies to the rule that 
freshman wear ties and dinks. Why, then do so many seniors proudly wear 
the ties at any time and the dinks at some school affairs?
It cannot be over emphasized that these regulations have not been 
designed to set aside the freshman from the rest of the classes. Rather, the 
little segregation that will occur should be a part of a larger plan to teach 
all the students that there is more to Carnegie Tech than book-learning; 
that traditions play an important part in differentiation between a high 
school and a real college.
Calendar For C.I.T. Classes 
Announced By Administration
A Sad Case
Last Monday, registration day, there appeared on all the bulletin 
boards on the campus a notice asking for the return of tuition money which 
had been stolen from a student. At the end of last semester, just as at the 
end of every semester, a list of missing books and magazines was compiled 
in the various branches of the library. Students are continually reporting 
losses and disappearance of personal property from private lockers.
Up until press time no information had yet been received concerning 
the whereabouts of this money. Other missing items range from textbooks 
to articles of clothing. It is a rather deplorable situation when college stu
dents cannot be trusted.
The people in this institution are presumably admitted on the basis 
of intelligence and personal character. In spite of the fact that exceptions 
to the rule are accepted by society, the dishonest appropriation of other 
peoples property is not particularly complimentary to the character of a 
college student. By the time a person reaches the age of a college fresh
man, he should know the difference between the principles of honesty and 
dishonesty. And if he is worthy of being a college student, his principle 
should be that of honesty.
Dishonesty in this case does not merely mean deliberate stealing. It ap
plies just as well to keeping articles which have been found. And the ex
cuse of not knowing where to turn in these found articles is NOT an ex
cuse. Mrs. Pick in room 6 M. M. as well as the Lost and Found office in 
Administration Hall take charge of found articles and see that they are 
returned to their rightful owners.
There is, unfortunately, no way to reclaim items taken by a common 
thief and all one can do in that case is feel sorry for the poor, insane de
linquent.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
ftaff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

Students Are Needed 
As Volunteer Nurses
At this time our country is in 
great peril. Nurses are needed by 
the score. The demand is greater 
than the supply. So, the home front 
must suffer.
We are not all suited to become 
nurses but we can help out in this 
emergency by joining the Volunteer 
Nurses Aide Corps.
Students in school naturally find it 
difficult to give up eighty hours of 
their time for a course in Nurses 
Aid work. But, the Red Cross has 
offered to give a special accelerated 
course for Carnegie Tech students 
in May providing at least fifteen 
students are interested. The course 
will be given at some central hos
pital, and will last for three weeks. 
In order to enroll in this course a 
student must be at least 18 years 
old, pass a physical examination, 
and be willing to donate at least 150 
hours of her time during the year.
Anyone interested should get in 
touch with Dolly Willison.
Teknon Meetings Held 
Wednesday Evenings
Teknon is an inter-denomination
al religious group composed of Tech 
students and meeting each Wednes
day at the Shadyside Presbyterian 
Church, Amberson Street and West
minster Place. Informal discussions 
led by Reverend Donald Campbell, 
supper, and an occasional social 
hour comprise the activities of the 
group.
Members of Teknon would like 
their friends to join them for dinner 
and the discussion which follows. 
Supper is free, and the collection 
taken at each meefing is donated to 
a student-selected charity at the end 
of the year.
To join Teknon, sign the list post
ed on any of the bulletin boards, 
and be at the canteen at 5:40 Wed
nesday afternoon to join the rest 
of the group for the trip to Shadyside.

Continued from page 1
It is to be highly doubted that 
anyone now at Tech can remember 
when we took a basketball game 
from Pitt. In fact, with the excep
tion of 1938, we doubt that anyone 
can remember when a Tech team 
beat a Pitt team at anything. Gen
eration upon generation of hope
ful Tartans have gone forth an
nually to see their athletic teams 
trampled before their traditional 
opponent. Such, again, was the cast 
last Wednesday, when Max Hannum put forth his most promising 
court combination in several years. 
All that the boys could give was 
not enough. The final score 59-45 
tells something of the relative 
strengths, but it took a lot of spirit 
and fight to hold the Pitt team that 
low. Doc Carlson this year brought 
forth his usual lineup sprinkled 
with boys who had played four to 
seven years of college and profes
sional ball, with the result that the 
spirited Tartans were just swamped.
The Pitt team started from the 
opening whistle, and tallied twenty 
points before Tech had sunk a field 
goal. This pretty well settled the 
outcome, as the Tech zone was un
able to stop some unbelievable shots 
by speedy Pitt forwards. These 
opening shots looked unbelievably 
lucky, but after the first ten or so 
went in, we began to realize that 
our boys were just in over their 
heads. The Hannum boys werent 
convinced, though, and smacked 
back to shave the Pitt lead to 34-26 
at the half. Morinellos opening 
field goal in the second half pulled 
us within six points of Pitt, but this 
was the homeward trail, and the 
Pitt reserves boosted them over the 
top. The Panthers had stretched it 
to a round 50-35 at the third quar
ters end, and coasted in ahead of 
the fatigued home team.
' We now come to treat a subject 
which has been bothering us all sea
son, and has caused an unbelievable 
change in the game of basketball. 
Last Wednesday we spent roughly 
twenty-one minutes of the evening 
watching the two teams shoot for

While in this city, from Decemsixty-four fouls. The game certain
ly was rough and fast, but Walsh 
and Kress, the officials, called 
enough fouls in the last half to slow 
the action down to a standstill. This 
was just a repeat of the treatment 
we saw at Geneva. It doesnt seem 
to us that the boys play such a dirty 
game, but the varmints in the strip
ed shirts really have it in for basket
ball players in general. Somethings 
got to be done to speed up the game.
As usual, the two most pleasing 
ball players to watch turned out to 
be Clougherty and Morinello. These 
boys play as though they enjoy the 
game, and provide most of the scor

Second Annual Dinner Dance 
Held At The Carnegie Union
The Evening Student Councils 
and Inter-Fraternities dinner dance 
was a real success even considering 
the fact that at the last minute the 
orchestra due to circumstances be
yond their control couldnt show up 
for the dance. Tom Harkenrider the 
leader of the group was inducted in
to the armed services and it was im
possible to find some one to replace 
him.
The dinner was delicious and un
usual in that anyone who wanted a 
second helping of chicken ala king 
could have had it just for the asking. 
The second helping tasted better 
than the first.
Although the orchestra, as men

ing along a large assortment of upto-date popular recordings varying 
from soft and sweet to boogie 
woogie.
For those people who didnt feel 
like dancing, but liked a friendly 
game of cards plenty of tables and 
comfortable chairs were available
for just that type of entertainment.
Then, those who felt like some
thing more strenuous than dancing 
or playing cards were to be found in 
the play room banging away at a 
ping pong ball. One game of ping 
pong that was played surely must 
have been for blood, for when four 
engineers get together and each 
knows plenty about angles and de
flections and each claims he is a 
champion, you can imagine what 
happens.
Look At The Figures 
But Please Dont Frown
Enrollment for the second se
mester of the Evening School has 
just been completed and the new 
figures indicate there has been an
other drop. This condition is to be 
expected during the present war 
emergency. There are so many fea
tures which enter into a study of 
the trend that no definite decision 
can be made as to why the figures 
are so small.
'LfOWl dito^i f&plif,
Ever since Mr. McKelway an
nounced at the Election Party that 
the fall term of 1945-46 school year 
would begin in October instead of 
September as it has the past three 
years, a number of students have 
contacted your Editor and asked the 
reason for this change.
The Evening student is in favor 
of the present program. With the 
semester ending just before the 
Christmas holidays, the student can 
celebrate this vacation as such. The 
tendency of allowing all the work, 
experiments and problems to lag be
hind and try to make this work up 
during the holidays, together with 
planning for the finals which would 
come soon after under the past and 
again proposed plan, is eliminated 
by the present plan. Very few ever 
dig out from under all this work 
during the festive holiday season 
and the result is little sleep and lots 
of cramming for the exams. This 
physical and mental exertion is not 
the best way to start the new semes
ter hence the present plan is far 
more favorable to the student. The 
second semester ends early enough 
for the student who is interested in 
gardening to get his crops in at the 
proper season and the desire to at
tend the Supplementary Term is

First call upon those around and 
likely to attend classes, of course, 
comes from the armed services. At 
the present time there seems to be 
a hesitancy on the part of students 
to come back for classes as they do 
not know how long they will be 
around atid this does make for a 
lower registration. Then there is the 
feeling that with only a short time 
left to attend classes it is not worth 
the effort and expense to come out 
for the present.
Students cannot be blamed for 
taking such an attitude when they 
see around them vacant places left 
by former class-mates. There is, 
however, another side and that is 
there is a post-war period which 
promises many advantages.

completed, as of January 12, 1945,

greater since the term ends before 
the hot weather and also early 
enough to have a vacation in July or 
August when the season is the best. 
An Evening student needs relaxa
tion after attending three terms at 
Tech and working a six and seven 
day week in industry.
The administration states that be
ginning the semester in September 
is too early as a rule for college and 
many persons call late into October 
asking when the fall term begins. 
With the school running three se
mesters per year, the new program 
will be more feasible to new Fresh
men coming in at the February and 
June term since the high school 
schedule fits better into this new 
program. The vacation before the 
holiday can start sooner and thus 
enable day school students to earn 
some money during the pre-holiday 
period. If the schedule for evening 
school differed from the day school 
schedule the instructors in the Col
lege of Fine Arts and Margaret Mor
risons would have to report back a 
month before the day school term 
started. The one program also helps 
in running class at nights where 
enrollment for subjects is too small 
to carry on but by making up the 
quota with day students it can be 
taught.
Since the mid-term enrollment is 
probably the most important factor 
in making the present change a 
most hopeful outlook is seen for 
the future and the return to the 
present program is that when times 
are normal again Carnegie Tech 
does not have to depend upon the 
mid-term enrollment which never 
was encouraged in the past.
If anyone has any further com
ments that they wish to make, 
please write in care of The Plaid,
