The new library and study wing 
devoted to the Division of Human
istic and Social Studies represents 
the main addition to Carnegie Tech 
facilities resulting from a consid
erable program of improvements 
undertaken in the past summer.
This expansion of quarters for 
the growing Humanistic and Social 
courses was provided by moving 
the old electrical equipment shop, 
renovating the second floor of the 
wing it occupied directly opposite 
the offices of Director Willard E. 
Hotchkiss and building a third floor 
over this accessible by short dou
ble stairways.
The third floor, where seating capicity for more than 100 students 
is provided, houses the new li
brary and a library workroom and 
office. A collection of about 2,000 
volumes will be shortly available 
there, and will gradualy be in
creased.
The. backbone of this reading ma
terial is the Falk Collection, donated 
by the Maurice and Laura Falk 
Foundation and comprising in the 
neighborhood of 500 volumes and 
periodicals now being collected by 
Dr. Nathan Miller, research and 
bibliographical associate of the 
Humanistic and Social Studies Divi
sion.
Directly below the library itself, 
a suite of five offices, two seminar 
rooms, a classroom and workroom 
provide a working headquarters for 
the Humanistic and Social Rela
tions program. The offices will be 
occupied by some of tfc ' instructors 
participating in tl e Soci. Relations 
program. ,c1i <0 -r^J<rK>-
Boys-Girls
Like to Dance?
Heres a Chance!
The first all school social affair 
will take place the second day of 
school, Thursday, September 18. It_ 
is to be the Mortar Board tea dance 
an informal dance held in Thistle 
Hall from 4:00 P. M. to 6:00 P. M. 
The cost will be twenty-five cents 
per person, and refreshments will 
be sold.
The dance promises to be quite 
a gala affair, for Dale Sommers and 
his ten-piece orchestra will fur
nish the music. Dale is well known 
for his many appearances at fra
ternity and sorority functions, and 
for his medley of popular college 
songs.
There is absolutely no restric
tion about bringing dates to these 
dances, but it is the custom for both 
boys and girls to come stag. The 
main reason for this is that there 
is unrestricted cutting in so one 
is more often without his date than 
he is with her. Since one of the 
purposes of the dances is to help 
the students to get acquainted, it 
is entirely permissible for a young 
man to cut in on some strange 
but beautiful co-ed and introduce 
himself.

With summer theaters enjoying 
their most successful season in 
years, it was not surprising to find 
that students and alumni of the 
Tech Drama Department were ac
tive in almost every major summer 
theater enterprise.
To his Cohasset Playhouse near 
Boston, Mass., Fred Burleigh, 
Pittsburgh director, took William 
Eythe, Esther Jane Coryell, Helene 
Jaffin and Patricia Nadler. Bill 
Eythe did such good work that 
Jane Cowl heard about him and 
invited him to read for a role in 
her forthcoming New York pro
duction. When the musical hit, 
Lend an Ear, was produced Ed 
Hunt, Shirley Brown, Carl Benz, 
and Norma Shea of Tech also join
ed the cast.
At Bucks dounty Playhouse, New

Slate Paralysis 
Epidemic Affects 
Tech Registration
A rather serious outbreak of in
fantile paralysis cases in central 
and eastern Pennsylvania has forc
ed Carnegie Tech officials to ask all 
students coming from that section 
of the state to undergo a 14-day 
quarantine in their homes before 
registering.
The action was taken for the pur
pose of safeguarding student health 
after consultation with Pennsylva
nia and City of Pittsburgh health 
authorities. Dr. Warden, Dean of 
Students, stated:
This is purely a preventative 
measure, since local authorities in
form us there is no present danger 
of an infantile paralysis epidemic 
in the Pittsburgh district. But we 
are doing everything possible to 
safeguard the community and our 
student body against a spread of 
the disease to this region.
Telegrams followed by letters 
were dispatched to the 35 students 
living in areas of the epidemic. The 
letters, signed by Dr. Warden, out
lined the following procedure for 
students in such areas:
You should contact your local 
health officer and ask him to place 
you under a 14-day observation 
quarantine in your home prior to 
the time of your departure for 
school. You must not be in contact 
with anybody but your immediate 
family.
At the end of the quarantine you 
must obtain a certificate from this 
same officer saying that you have 
compiled with this requirement and 
present it to the registrar before 
you will be permitted to register. 
There will be no penalty for
Informal Lectures, 
Smokers Planned 
For Coming Year
Last year, the Student Council 
established the Freshmen Orient-: 
tion Committee to assist the Fresh
men Subcommittee, by providing 
that this committee conduct a com
prehensive, year-long, student or
ientation program. The committee 
is composed of two representatives 
of Interfraternity Council, two rep
resentatives of the Mens Dormi
tory Council, and two representa
tives of the Citcom Clan.
Sponsors Selected
With the aid of the department 
heads, the committee selected a 
sponsor committee composed of a 
sufficient number of juniors and 
seniors to act as sponsors for the 
freshmen boys. During the .sum
mer, the Office of the Dean of Stu
dents assigned to each sponsor sev
eral freshmen registered in the 
sponsors department for the fall 
semester. Due to the drop in en
rollment, all the men asked to 
serve on the sponsor conun ittee 
have not as yet been assigned ad
visees, but will be in the near fu
ture, Each sponsor contacted his 
advisees during the summer, thus 
facilitating the freshmen in adjust
ing tihemselves to Tech life. 
Year-Round Program
The work of the Orientation 
Committee and the sponsors will 
not. end with the close of Froshmnn 
Week. Throughout the year, 'tin.* 
sponsors will cooperate with the 
freshmen mentors in seeing that 
their advisees assume their schol
astic responsibilities, and also Qtti1- 
courage them to take part In extra
curricular activities. The program 
also Includes departmental meet
ings which will be held through
out the year. These gathering will 
be in the form of smokers, forums, 
or informal lectures, the purpose of 
which will be to further the freshman's interest in trie department 
and to facilitate his meeting both 
the other freshmen and upperclass
men in his department, and also his 
departmental staff instructors. Intradepartmental meetings will be 
held which will afford the students 
of one department an opportunity 
to meet those of another, and at the 
same time, to learn what the var
ious departments offer. All mem
bers of the faculty are welcome at 
these gatherings and the upper
classmen in the department spon
soring the event are urged to at
tend. The first of the department
al smoker parties, will be held to
morrow evening, September 18, at 
eight oclock in the Carnegie Union. 
On Monday evening, September 22 
at eight oclock, the Chemical En
gineers will have their smoker in 
the Union. The dates for the other 
departmental meetings will be an

THE CARNEGIE TAKTANWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1941
Welcome To Tech
Welcome Freshmen to Carnegie Teeliwelcome to a Tech which 
has removed some of the last vestige of the myth of the carefree 
college boy. Mazing is gone and a new orientation plan for Fresh
men lias been adopted. This change lias provided something worth
while and constructive. Whole-hearted support together with pa
tience is needed on your part if we are to derive the fullest benefits 
of this plan.
Kven far mort! reaching than the abolition of hazing in doing 
away with the myth is the critical situation in the world today. 
In the past going to school meant a sheltered lifethe problems of 
the outside world and even the home were far removed from the stu
dents mind. The only things that mattered were the good times, 
lots <>f friends, studies, and occasionally a job to earn a little extra 
spending money. All this is or will soon be at an end.
Today national defense is foremost on our bill of fare. It in
volves the integration of industry, agriculture, and the scientific pro
fessions. Each group must have its trained personnel and have them 
in sufficient numbers to function properly. To meet this challenge 
we are devoting our all-out efforts to provide trained technicians in 
the industrial and scientific fields. Every phase of student endeavor 
will be directed toward this goal.
To you freshmen falls the hardest lot. Four years of intensive 
study are ahead of you with WAR in the offing, bringing with it the 
devestating disruption of current schedules and plans. The outlook 
is indeed bleak, but do not hesitate in the pursuit of your education, 
for it will be your education that will decide the issues and solve the 
problems of the next decade,
More to School Than Studies
Within a small radius of Carnegie Tech are many of the finest 
examples of the products of engineering skill and artistic endeavor 
the Carnegie Library, the Museum, the art galleries, the conserva
tory, the concerts, the steel mills, the planetariumall a blend of art 
and engineering. To the newcomers, the Class of 1945, take ad
vantage of all these marvelous opportunities to broaden your interest 
and to cultivate your appreciation of the masterpieces of our modern 
world. Whether you be engineer, fine arts, 01* Maggie Murph, there 
is something here for you.
Call for Cul Reporters
You who are for the first; time entering Tech may have known 
some of the joy that comes from creative effort on a school publica
tion and the satisfaction of a job well done. The TARTAN can be 
your job and one that will be well worth your while since it not only 
offers you a chance to improve or display your writing ability, but 
also a chaneo to enjoy the companionship of others arid learn from 
them.
We urge you to seriously consider coming out for the TARTAN. 
We do this not to assure the future of the TARTAN, since there will 
always be someone who has the perseverance to put out this paper, 
but. because we feel that you will gain from this experience. The 
TARTAN is an education in itself. But you say,  I cannot write 
with a flair. I am not a writer! Our reply is that geniuses are rare 
and that, our main requirement for TARTAN work is the afore
mentioned perseverance. Drop in at the TvVRTAN office on the 
third floor of the Union any Friday and a member of our Senior staff 
will be glad to grant you an interview and put you to work.

All faithful subscribers to Es
quire Magazine have probably read 
the story therein entitled Howard 
Baer: Doubling in Paint, but this 
is for the great majority who bor
row the other fellows copy just 
for the Petty and Varga drawings.
Howard Baer, in case you didnt 
know, is a Tech grad, class of 28, 
and a famous cartoonist and cari
caturist. The article in Esquire, 
concerns itself mainly with exploit
ing Baers versatility in the field of 
Art, and on the side, builds up a 
case on how fortunate Esquire is in 
having this great artist work for 
them.
The article is well written and 
there are several phases of it deal
ing with Baer's school years which 
Esquire graciously allows us to 
reprint. We have picked out the 
more interesting sections and they 
follow:
When Howard Was twelve his 
father died and the family moved 
to Pittsburgh, renting out the store. 
Howard and his brother atended the 
Pittsburgh public schools, Howard 
continuing his interest in art and 
sketching. In high school he be
came art editor of the student pub
lication. The crochety old women 
who taughtor attempted to teach 
art in the Pittsburgh school system 
did not make the subject very in
teresting, but despite them, young 
Baer thought the subject worth do
ing. During his senior high school 
year, however, he came up against 
a somewhat more inspiring speci
men of pedagogy, a young man 
named Stephens who subsequently

Fellowships in the College of En
gineering have been awarded to 34 
graduate students for the coming 
school year, according to an an
nouncement by Dr. Webster N. 
Jones, Director.
In the College of Fine Arts, two 
fellowships have been awarded. 
Both are in the Department of 
Architecture and are held by two 
former students of the Department: 
Irene von Horvath, 40; and Jacob 
Tracht, 40.
Nineteen of the engineering fel
lowships are new appointments this 
year, awarded to recent graduates 
who will continue their studies at 
Carnegie Tech this year. The group 
includes six fellowships sponsor
ed by industrial firms, four Buhl 
Fellowships in electrical engineer
ing, and 24 teaching assistantships 
in metallurgy, chemistry, physics, 
and chemical engineering.
Six of the new appointments 
went to 1941 graduates of Carnegie 
Tech. They are Alfred M. Fciler, 
teaching assistant, civil engineer
ing; Lawrence R. Greenhaus, teach
ing assistant, chemical engineering; 
Jobe Jenkins, Buhl Fellow in elec
trical engineering; Glen I. Kirk
wood, teaching assistant, physics; 
William T. Lankford, Jr., teaching 
assistant, metallurgical engineering; 
and Vincent G. Shaw, Buhl Fel
low.
Graduates from other school who 
have received, teaching assistant
ships for 1941-42 at Tech include; 
Herman Childress, Cairo, 111., and 
Robert R. Rothfus, Rochester, N. 
Y., chemical engineering; Arthur 
M. Stiles, Cherokee, Iowa, electrical 
engineering (Buhl Research Fel
low); Benjamin F. Brown, Ash
land, Ky., Albert G. Guy, Chicago, 
111., and Charles H. Parcels, 
Rochester, N. Y., metallurgical en
gineering; Angel A. Colon, Puerto 
Rico, Raymond P. Mariella, Phil
adelphia, George Dienes, Budapest, 
Hungary, and William R. McMillan, 
Haywood, 111., chemistry; and Leo
became head of all the art classes 
in the Pittsburgh school system. 
Stephens suggested that Baer at
tend the Saturday morning sketch 
class for high school students given 
at the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, and the young man at
tended, profiting greatly thereby.
From the age of twelve and into 
his college years Baer had been at
tending a summer camp in the Adirondacks, at Racquet Lake, in 
which environs he did a consid
erable amount of sketching, some
times in the company of Shaemas 
OBrien, Irish poet and sculptor, 
who encouraged the younger man in 
his ambition and urged Mrs. Baer to 
allow her son to attend Carnegie.
At that center of learning, 
which he entered after his gradua
tion from high school, he specialized 
in the painting and illustrating 
courses. Of all the Carnegie Tech 
teachers with whom he came into 
contact he recalls with especial grat' itude Samuel Rosenberg, not for 
anything he taught, but for his 
general influence and encourage
ment. Upon his graduation, in 1928, 
he was offered the post of art teach
er at a private school near Pitts
burgh and the more mundane job 
of designing tiles, but he refused 
both, for he had other projects in 
mind, and he came to New York.
From that point on the article tells 
how Mr. Baers other projects 
eventually brought him fame and 
fortune. The last page deals with 
the Baers recent trip to Mexico 
and is followed by a page of his 
paintings on Mexico.
Wangeman Heads 
Placement Bureau
Charles E. Wangeman has been 
appointed head of the Bureau of 
Placements at Carnegie Institute of

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Coaches Build 
Team Around 
Few Veterans
Another school year has rolled 
around bringing with it another 
football season. Again the Tech 
Bowl is the scene of activity as 
Dr. Eddie Baker and his staff of 
mentors put the boys through the 
paces of pre-season training. At 
the present time some thirty men 
have reported for this training with 
five or six more expected to be in 
uniform in the next few days.
Although this years schedule 
does not look so tough at a glance, 
it must be remembered that some 
of the teams that will be met this 
year are starting to build a rugged 
team and so add a group of better 
schools to their card.
Since the squad is not exactly a 
flock of beef trusts, the good Doc
tor is trying to build a shifty, 
speedy team. There, are several 
men who are speed kings and are 
likely to carry the brunt of the at
tack. One should have a great 
deal of admiration for a group of 
boys who work as hard as these 
boys do under the conditions that 
exist. Also one should not count 
this team out. There is a great
4u.cENCRAVINCCOMPANY
possibility that many people will be 
surprised with the showing the 
Tartans make this year.
In addition to our head coach, 
Dr. Eddie Baker, Muggsy Skladany 
will handle the ends, Bill Glassford 
will run the guards and tackles, 
and A1 Irwin will keep the fresh
men on the right track. Three 
Baker tutored men will be on hand 
to lend a helping hand; they are 
Bill Kuenzli, Joe Betz and Tony 
Laposki. Two of these men will 
work with A1 Irwin as freshmen 
coaches and the other will assist 
Baker with the varsity.
The following men will probably 
play the greater part of many of 
the games: EndsAnderson, Matonis; tackles  Lindberg, Moor
man; guardsMinkel, Boyd, Pur
cell; centerHolets; quarterback 
Johnson; halfbacksCantini, Push; 
fullbackPhilipchuck.
The schedule is as follows:
September 27  Westminster at 
Pittsburgh.
October 3Albright College at 
Reading, Pa.
October 11Muhlenburg at Al
lentown.
October 18University of Notre 
Dame at Pittsburgh.
October 25Geneva College at 
Beaver Falls, Pa.
October 31Case at Cleveland,O.
November 8University of Cin
cinnati at Cincinnati, O.
November 29  University of 
Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh.
Please note that the October 11 
date x has been filled with Muhlen
burg. This game has been added 
to the schedule just recently and 
may not appear on some earlier 
schedules.
Dr. Baker is of the firm opinion 
that if the student body will sup
port the team, whole-heartedly the 
season will be far more successful 
than many of the scribes think.

Sports Outline
Intercollegiate Sports Offered To
Students By C. 1. T.
Carnegie oilers the following ath
letic activities in which all stu
dents may participate during the 
forthcoming year:
FOOTBALL: Up until the last
football season, Carnegie has put 
good teams on the Held. Although 
last year broke that record, Coach 
Eddie Baker says Hint the students 
may again expect to see Carnegies 
name rise again in the football 
limelight this year. The freshmen 
have as their gridiron pilot A1 Ir
win, who has coached the freshmen 
for the past several years.
BASKETBALL: Due to loss of
several of the stars of the year 
before last, last years team did not 
measure up to the record of former 
years. Although the same situation 
exists to some extent this year due 
to loss of Red Burch and a few 
others, we may expect a little bet
ter showing this year. This is ac
countable by the fact that a new 
crop of talent is coming up from 
last years Freshman team.
TRACK: Coach Guy Halferty is 
raising Techs pi'owess on the cin
der path by instilling some of his 
own enthusiasm into his squad. 
This quality in Halferty has filled 
his department with more spirit 
and drive than in any other field.
Athletic Board
And it is this fact rather than any 
special presence of talent that made 
last years record as good as it was.
CROSS - COUNTRY: The same
record set up by the track squad 
was put in by the cross-country 
team. Our three-mile and six-mile 
courses are run through Schenley 
Park and are considered as the fin
est in western Pennsylavnla,
SWIMMING: Last year Coach
Allen Risedorph put one of the fin
est teams in competition in the his
tory of Carnegie Tech. Although ' 
both Molvie and Boehmig are no 
longer in school, we may hope 
that this years record will top or 
equal last years.
SOCCER: Student interest in
HR55N. ran high as is evidenced by / 
the fact that large numbers of boys 
turned out for practice. Although 
no shining record was set up, such 
activity will not for long go un
rewarded, so this year we may well 
hope for a good showing for the 
coming season.
RIFLE TEAM: For the past sev
eral years Carnegies rifle team 
ranked among the leading teams in 
the National Rifle Competition. In 
1940 the womens rifle team won 
the National Womens Rifle Com
petition.

Coach A1 Irwin, in charge of the 
Freshman Football squad, an
nounced last week that all candi
dates for the 1941 plebe squad 
should report to him at the Field 
House on Wednesday, September 
17, at 4:30 P. M.
Any students interested in the 
job of manager of the Freshman 
football squad should report to A1 
Irwin at the Field House within 
the next few days.

Although the same faces will be 
seen around the Tech Bowl as head 
coach and the chief assistants, sev
eral new faces have been added to 
the Tech coaching staff. Head 
coach Eddie Baker is back, assisted 
by Muggsy Skladany and Biff Glass
ford as usual. A1 Irwin is back as 
mentor of the freshmen football 
squad. During the past season, 
Tiger Schmidt and Merlyn Condit 
have left the ranks of Carnegie 
Coaches. To replace these men 
who have left, three members of 
last years varsity eleven have been 
added to the coaching staff, Joe 
Betz, Bill Kuenzli, and Tony La
poski. One of this group will as
sist A1 Irwin in his chores with the 
freshmen, the other two will tutor 
the varsity squad.
Joe Betz, who was varsity end 
on the 1940 squad, wiLl undoubtedly 
assist Joe Skladany in his coaching 
of the ends. Last years full-back, 
Tony Laposki will aid in the backfield work, and Bill Kuenzli will 
work with the guards, this being 
familiar territory to the Midget. 
' AIL these boys have spent their 
entire college careers at Carnegie 
Tech, playing four years of foot
ball on Tech squads. Although Joe 
Betz was forced out of action about 
the middle of last season due to 
a severe knee injury, he was one 
of the outstanding players on the 
squad. Bill Kuenzli has played 
three years of varsity ball at Tech, 
being a first string guard in the 
post-season Sugar Bowl game. The 
addition of these boys to the staff 
will ease the burden on the other 
coaches shoulders.
J -//ato/ tifo apat, "Don't Forget Your Parker!
Carnegie Techs football hopes are again placed in practically the same 
staff that tutored the squad last season. Head Coach Eddie Baker, Sklad
any, and Glassford have remained, along with A1 Irwin who grooms the 
plebe squad. Schmidt and Condit have been replaced by Joe Betz, Bill 
Kuenzli, and Tony Laposki, all of them having been prominent members 
of the 1940 team.

Activity Offered 
To Every Student
If at all possible, every member 
of the incoming Freshman class 
should find time to participate in 
some sort of the athletics offered 
to the student body by the college 
administration. No doubt many of 
the freshmen were actively en
gaged in some sort of athletics 
while they were in high school. 
There is no reason why this activ
ity should be dropped when the 
student roaches collegefor this, 
the college offers many varied 
sports in which a lagre number of 
students are actively engaged at 
the present time. Everyone has 
the right and the opportunity to try 
out for these teams, and his suc
cess depends on his ability alone.
Many students, for some reason 
or another such as lack of time or 
ability, will be unable to win a 
place on these teams. For this 
group, the Department of Intra
mural Athletics was created a num
ber of years ago. In this manner 
every member of the student body 
has the opportunity to participate 
in the sport of his choice.
The Intramural program, which 
is directed by Mr. Frank Eyman 
and the Intramural Board, a 
group of students selected to rep
resent the whole school, is the gol
den opportunity of the students not 
engaged in varsity or freshman 
sports. This pi-ogram has become 
increasing popular every year and 
a large percentage of the student 
body is actively engaged in the 
sports sponsored by the board un
der Mr. Eyman.
Among the sports in the program 
are football, basketball, softball, 
and bowling in addition to table 
tennis and swimming. According 
to the program, all those interested 
in badminton, table tennis, horse
shoes, and croquet can use the fa
cilities which will soon be available 
at the Student Union between 
3:00-6:00 P. M. and 7:00-8:30 P. M. 
and also between 10:00-12:00 A. M. 
and 3:00-6:00 P. M. on Saturdays. 
EVERY STUDENT SHOULD 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OP
PORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE 
IN THE FORMS OF ATHLETICS 
OFFERED TO THE STUDENT 
BODY BY THE SCHOOL.

Student Council functions as the 
student governing body at Carnegie 
Tech. Its duties are many and va
ried including the making of laws, 
the direction of campus activities, 
and the creation of better rela
tionships between the student body 
and the faculty. Our Student Coun
cil, unlike that in arty other col
lege, represents every student on 
campus rather than just a few 
minority groups.
Each of the three schools is rep
resented by voting members taken 
from the sophomore, junior, and 
senior classes. Since the Engineer
ing School has the largest enroll
ment, it elects ten voting members, 
leaving Margaret Morrison and 
Fine Arts to elect five voting mem
bers each. Three non-voting mem
bers are elected from the sophomore 
class who may voice the opinions 
of their fellow classmates at any 
time and in that way influence the 
voting.
At the beginning of the school 
year a budget is drawn up and 
funds allotted for salaries, func
tions, organizations, etc. While 
Student Council supervises every 
dance, the only affair that is strict
ly sponsored by Student Council 
.is the Spring Carnival which is 
held in May. Last year a new idea 
was inaugurated in the way of tea 
dances, designed to eliminate stag 
lines and wallflowers. It was put 
into effect with the very successful 
Spanish Swing which started off 
with a bang when everyone shook 
hands. After each dance partners 
would be forced to break up and 
dance with someone else.
This year the President of Stu
dent Council is Charles Richardson, 
42, Printing. Other officers are 
Vice-presidentBill Reynolds, 42, 
Mechanical Engineering; Secretary 
Dorothy Piper, 42, Secretarial 
Science; TreasurerHarvey Hill, 
42, P&D.
