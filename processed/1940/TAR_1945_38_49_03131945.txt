Skibos End Season 
With 5040 Loss To 
Slippery Rock Team
Techs determined little band of 
basketeers traveled to Slippery 
Rock last Friday evening to close 
the 1944-5 season with a disappoint
ing 50-40 loss. Earlier in the season, 
Tech plus Theodore and Clougherty won 27-25 from the Rockets nineI man squad. Slippery Rocks vast im
provement during the season com
bined with Techs service losses, 
though, was sufficient to turn the 
tide.
At least there was nothing screwy 
about the scoring this week. Tech 
took a small lead as the game open
ed, but the flying Rockets closed the 
gap and led the rest of the way. 
Five points was usually the differ
ence until the wild fourth quarter, 
when both teams scored freely. As 
in the previous game, Mike Seyman 
was high scohere for the Rockets, 
and Tasso Katselas came away with 
the honors for Tech.
This game is the last leaf in the 
book of another Tech basketball 
season. As for the past five or six 
years, our team wasnt a world-beat
er or a high-priced outfit, but a 
bunch who were going out because

Individual High Scores 
Spark Intramural Games
Last week the intramural league 
showed several action-packed games 
sparked by individual high scores. 
On Monday, for instance, the Betas 
opened the evenings action by 
smothering a four-man Theta Tau 
squad 43-12. Rose had 22 points for 
the Betas, alone enough to take the 
game easily.
The same evening Theta Xi threw 
a scare into the league-leading Delts 
by putting on a last quarter rally. 
The Delts soon stopped this, though, 
and walked off with a 33-24 count in 
their favor.
Also last Monday, the SAEs bat
tled the Rex in the most thrilling 
game yet this year. Kondrat and 
Mruk put the Rex well ahead mid
way in the second quarter, but the 
SAEs rallied behind Dave Saylor 
and led at the half by 22-21. The 
final minutes were thrilling and 
close, and the Rex finally took the 
game 43-40! Walt Mruk led the Rex 
with 21 points and Saylor had 18 
k for SAE.
Wednesdays games showed the 
Delts romping through Theta Tau, 
69-17, as Hall set a new league rec
ord by scoring 45 points, the Rex 
stomping DU as MrUk got 32, and 
the SAEs dropping Cameron Halls 
reinforced team by 39-19.

Candidates for School Offices 
Give Views on Pertinent Issues
As announced in last weeks Tartan, the platforms of the candidates 
for Activities Council are here printed. These platforms were submitted by 
the candidates themselves and have not been edited by the Tartan staff.
Ada Virginia Bucy: As your rep
resentative to ACAC I would try to 
effectively organize and effectively 
represent all Margaret Morrison 
women, including both sorority and 
independent groups, so that ACAC 
itself will become more self-enterprising and more aggressive. It is 
necessary for the campus as a whole 
to make itself felt socially as well as 
otherwise, so that school activities 
will not be supported by small 
groups of
Adeline Herlxck: If elected to the 
Activities Council, I shall try to ef
fect a constitutional 
change so that there 
may be unrestrict

I shall try to be

moting better relations between the 
faculty and students. If elected I 
shall serve those I represent to the 
best of my ability. What is best for 
Tech and its students will be fore
most in my mind.
Lucille Lou Emmel: My opinion 
is that Activities Council should be 
a more significant 
group on campus, 
not merely a clear
ing house for social 
events. It can be 
important only if 
students are en
couraged to come to 
the meetings or to 
make suggestions to 
their representatives so that they 
may take a really active part in stu
dent government. Only in this way 
can A.C. become a representative 
council, showing an alert interest in 
pertinent school affairs.
Dorothy Federman: What good do 
I think I might do? I think that I 
might do some good 
in that I will try to 
represent the stu
dent by presenting 
his ideas and opin
ions  not by pre
senting mine. If that 
is done, these are 
bound to be favor
able results because 
there will be no room for complaints 
about misrepresentation.
Rhoda M. Mears: (1) Student
Govt, more in the hands of the stu
dents with occasional help from fac

correlation between students and 
faculty. (3) More inter-school ac

valuable experience which could be

active part in governing the school. 
If elected I would try my best to 
accomplish these aims.

(2) Further Art 
School ambition in activities and 
scholarship. (3) Promote non-fraternity and fraternity interests alike. 
(4) Welcome any outside sugges

Edward Wiernasz: To all return

students we owe the obligation of 
having a progressive, dynamic ac
tivities council. This activities coun

the campus, responsive to students 
suggestions, and forthright in policy 
and service. An activities council,

All-School Dance 
Sponsored By AC
Friday, March 16, is the date 
which has been set for an informal 
dance sponsored by Activities Coun
cil. The dance, which will be held 
from 9:00 to 12:00 in the Exhibition 
Hall, is the second such affair of the 
season and should be bigger and bet
ter than its predecessor. For music 
there will be all the top hits by the 
top bands via ye olde juke box. 
Everyone is invited. Its stag or drag 
and if you are broke, thats no ex
cuse. Its FREE!
The main purpose of these dances 
is to bring students of all the schools 
together and to revive Techs slowly 
dying social life. According to Pat 
Werner, chairman of the dance, 
there will be fun and entertainment 
par excellence. So check March 16 
on your calendar and come prepared 
for a wonderful time.

Candidates Present Policies
Candidates for Activities Council 
have one more week to present their 
policies to the students. Today they 
have presented their platforms in 
the Tartan in order that everyone 
may have an understanding of their 
ideas and may vote more intelli
gently. Bulletin boards are available 
until election day for campaign ma
terial which may include pictures, 
posters and any other information 
that the candidate may wish the 
voters to know.
 The students will get their best 
chance to know their candidates by 
listening to the three-minute speech
es which will be given at the Activi

Friday night.
The candidates may be as ingeni
ous as they please in devising ways 
of impressing the students at the

This Is Your Duty
On pages one and two of tcJdays issue are presented the platforms and 
pictures of candidates for the election of Activities Council representatives 
to be held next Tuesday, March 20. They are printed here so that you, the 
voters, may turn in an intelligent ballot.
Too often a voter is unfamiliar with some of the candidates and their 
ideas and thus eliminates them from his consideration at the polls. This 
usually results in a generally unfair vote, which is sometimes the reason 
for the election of an incompetent person.
At this time, we cannot afford incompetency in a responsivle position. 
Although we have nothing like a peace time program now, we are eagerly 
looking forward to it. But you must remember that you cannot simply 
slide into it. You must work toward it with definite plans in mind. Progress 
cannot exist in the midst of confusion and misunderstanding.
You, therefore, must be guided by those whom you consider most capa
ble of clear, objective thinking and a sincere interest in student activities.
You must look through the list of platforms presented today and choose 
the candidate who seems, to you, to best grasp the situation of present day 
student government on the C. I. T. campus and who has the best plan for 
its necessary refinement.
This is one election in which the office should be considered before fra
ternity, sorority, or independent prestige. A member of the Activities Coun
cil represents everyone, and not only his fraternal organization.
Consider the function of the Council. Consider its responsibilities and 
duties. Consider the various candidates. Then make your choice. Be sure 
it is a wise and intelligent decision. You owe that much to yourself.
And, finally, go to the polls on Tuesday and cast your ballot.
The End Of An Era
The following has been received from Pvt. James W. Vaughan, Mili
tary Editor of the Tartan when the ASTP was in effect on this campus. We 
believe that the student body, especially those who knew the soldiers per
sonally, will appreciate this article and, therefore, we print it here.
Once upon a time there was a girl. 
For all intents and purposes, she 
was a rather typical girl. She had 
security; there was nothing in the 
world to bother her. She spent her 
time complacently, living for the 
fun she could get from life. This, 
then, was her credo.
One day, there came into her life 
a boy. Unfortunately, he was not of 
the same mold as she. He had com
paratively nothing; his future, and 
even his present, were clouded, and 
fun to him was of tertiary import
ance, ranking behind his hopes and 
his very life.
Now the girl did not realize these 
facts when they first came together; 
she did not comprehend the so
briety and depth of his manner. She 
treated him at first as one of her 
own ilk, and the boy, not under
standing her nonchalant insouci
ance, drew away from her.
And the gap continued to widen. 
It spread until an irreparable chasm 
yawned between them. The girl, 
seeing they were different, assum
ed she was the better. Her attitude 
toward him changed to one of sim
ple noblesse oblige. To her, he was 
no more than a ragged urchin, or a 
parvenu. He was nothing that was 
important: let him go his sordid 
way. She still had her own lige 
she was sufficient unto herself; she 
was happy; she did not need the rest 
of the world.
Time passed, as time is wont to do, 
and eventually the boy moved away.
Still later, the girl, glancing through 
a newspaper, came upon his picture. 
The caption was simple enough: 
Killed in Action.
Oh dear, isnt that horrid! I 
wonder what I shall wear to
night ... ;
Now this fable is not to be con
strued as representing any two 
given people. They simply do not 
exist. It is, rather, a parable pur
porting in a vague manner, to crys
tallize two divergent attitudes 
which, by a slight stretch of imag
ination, might as easily present the 
same attitudes on a nation-wide 
scale.
The ASTP, which will be remem
bered with mixed emotions, is no 
longer a direct influence at Tech, 
and such influence as it may once 
have lent is to be regretted. For the 
rather grotesque idea of seeing some 
GIs sacrificing their lives while 
othersno different  were worry
ing about an Electronics lab would 
tend to give a distorted view of the 
war itself. And so, it seemed to us, 
the AST was regarded with more or 
less of a tongue-in-cheek attitude.
We should like to dispel those 
feelings now. The proportion of for
mer Tech ASTers now serving in 
the Infantry is astonishingly large. 
The men themselves range in aca
demic success from Term I comple
tion to Term 7 graduation. The ma
jority of those in other branches are 
in combat.

dent at Carnegie Tech. To gain the 
respect of the faculty and the stu
dent body, such a group cannot tol

Dorothy Danko: If I am elected, 
I promise to make known to Activi

as to social activi

for prompt action 
on all such matters 
concerning both

any changes in al

Esther Haushalter: I believe AC 
has a definite responsibility on 
campus and only 
through active rep
resentation and en
thusiastic student 
participation can it 
realize its aim  
that of sponsoring 
student activities ef

duty of the repre

to replace pre-war 
extravaganzas with 
all-school shows and 
ingenious events 
other than dances 
which will bring 
out the hidden 
school-spirit that has not been

Robert Skinkle: I refuse to be ter

stitution which shall 
be the only supreme 
law of the council. 
2. The interpreta
tion of the constitu

Augie Binder: I will see that the 
College of Engineering again re
sumes its rightful 
place of leadership 
of Carnegie Tech. I 
will work for .great- m 
er self-government 
by students. I will 
abolish the mid- ' ~ '
night curfew rule 
on dormitories and 
fraternities. I will 
work for increased school spirit in 
all activities.
Robert Straka: There should be 
closer cooperation in all matters be
tween the three schools on campus. 
A program should be launched by 
AC to awaken in each student an 
interest in the school and its activi
ties. Policies and problems concern
ing the students should be handled 
by the students through the medium 
of student groups organized for that 
purpose. My platform is to support 
all proposals that would help carry 
out the above ideas.
Louis Umbach: The purpose of 
the Activities Council is to give the 
students of CIT power to regulate 
their own affairs. This is in keeping 
with the fundamental principles of 
Democracy. I agree with the many 
students who believe that Activities 
Council has not been faithful to this 
responsibility; and, if elected, will 
do my best to represent student 
opinion in the students governing

It Really Isnt Difficult
It isnt hard to give blood; at least 
that is what they kept telling me. 
Under the bewitching charm of Peg 
Cole who talked me into it, I finally, 
like a fool, decided to sign the card 
that would part me and my best 
friends, 5.38xl08 corpuscles  red, 
white, and even blue; for I was a 
true blue patriot.
The sun still shone brightly 
through the smoke when I took that 
last fatal step into the slaughter 
house. It was easy to get past the 
brigade of fountain-pen nurses to 
that last mile; in fact, I was shoved 
through against my own feeble will.
Too late, I detected the lust of 
blood in these previously kindly 
eyes. By this time I had been car
ried in, strapped on the table, and 
the process of slow death had begun. 
After much wringing by the med
icos, a pint was subtracted from my 
total of 0.724 pints, leaving me with 
less than nothing. It wasnt bad I 
concluded as I walked out alive

they like to play basketball. This 
years group, as those in years past 
worked hard and improved a lot 
during the season.
The suport given by the student 
body this year was weak, much 
poorer than in other years, but a 
faithful handful were there for the 
whole season. After the final prac
tice on Thursday the team optimis
tically elected Mel Klein captain for 
next year. Chances are that none of 
the boys of this years team will be 
here next season, but certainly their 
spirit and determination in the face 
of reverses wont be forgotten at 
Tech. Thanks, guys.
The other big bouquet lands in 
the lap of Max Hannum. As usual, 
Max had to start almost from 
scratch, but worked with his boys 
and became a real friend to them. 
I think every man Max has ever 
coached has considered him a per
sonal friend, the highest compliment 
a coach can receive. Chalk up anoth
er year for the cornerstone of the 
Tartan tradition.
To Give Blood
So many people have the impres
sion that giving blood is a hard job. 
The procedure is quite simple. It 
can best be explained by following 
a donor from start to finish and re
marking on his various stops.
He enters the Wabash Building, 
where the Blood Bank is located, 
and has his appointment cleared at 
a front desk on the first floor. He is 
then directed to the second floor 
where his coat is checked by a 
pleasant volunteer. After receiving 
a medical card, he meets the nurse 
who fills in his medical history, 
takes his pulse, his blood pressure 
and checks possibility of anemia.
Then he takes his place on a cot, 
where a nurse gently inserts a 
needle into a vein on the inside of 
his elbow. At this point the patient 
must do a little work for while the 
blood is flowing into the container he 
must slowly open and close his fist.
When it is all over, he is treated to 
a snack in the Canteen and sent on 
his merry way to continue his usual 
activities.

Citys Arts and Crafts Center 
Will Open Formally on Mar. 17
Professor J. B. Ellis, head of the 
Sculpture Department at Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, announced 
that the City of Pittsburgh Arts and 
Crafts Center will hold its formal 
opening Saturday, March 17, from 
8 to 11 P. M. Those attending the 
opening will see not only a preview 
of the combined exhibition by five 
resident member organizations of 
the center but also the entire center, 
which includes offices and meeting 
places for the ten resident organzations, studios, lecture rooms, and 
exhibition rooms. Tickets may be 
bought at the door; the admission 
charge will be $1.00.
The next day, Sunday, March 18, 
marks the beginning of the many 
opportunities which the center will 
furnish for all Pittsburghers who 
are interested in arts and crafts. 
Professor Ellis, the chairman of the 
Executive Board, made known that 
the center will be open to the gen
eral public each Saturday and Sun
day from 2 until 10, fifty-two weeks 
of the year. Exhibitions will be 
changed each month. Each Sunday 
evening one member organization 
will present a program in the com
Your Best Bet Is TEP
mons room which will be, like the 
exhibitions, free of charge and open 
to everyone. The first program, 
March 25 is sponsored by the Musi
cians Club.
Another feature of the center is 
that its facilities may be used by 
non-resident organizations for regu
lar meetings or special events on 
days other than Saturday or Sun
day. The only requisite for groups 
who wish to meet, present programs, 
or sponsor exhibitions at the center 
is that their activities must be in 
the field of arts and crafts and must

The property, now the Arts and 
Crafts Center, is the former Mar

City of Pittsburgh last year. City 
Council, recognizing the need for 
such a center, set up a budget to 
cover the maintenance of the build

groups were granted space in the 
center: Abstract Artists, Associated 
Artists, Authors Club, Contempo

TESDAY, MARCH 13, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
One of the Boys
On June 27, 1925, he opened his 
big brown eyes on a world of fas
cination and for Lenny Lerman this 
world about him has never lost that 
fascination. He is interested in 
everything. He has a flare for com
plex, impractical, and unconventipnal political opinions; he enjoys the 
arts; and he is intrigued by science. 
In music his tastes run toward the 
classical and light classical, espec
ially the modern varieties. His ap
preciation and understanding of 
painting is remarkable for an en
gineer and he even admits to enjoy
ing abstracts in spite of their ridicu
lous titles. As for the movies and the 
theater, everything goes but musical 
comedies. He is an avid and prolific 
reader. His particular avocation is 
photography (and dark rooms) and 
at present he is absorbed with three 
color work.
Lennys heart, however, is in sci
ence. Even as a youngster, he was 
forever inventing mechanical doodads or devising potent explosive 
mixtures or otherwise harassing his
Lt. Wines Reported 
Missing In Sub Action
Lt. (j. g.) Paul T. Wines has been 
reported missing in action as of No
vember 26 when the submarine, 
Tang, to which he was assigned, 
failed to report from patrol duty.
The son of Mr. and Mrs. W. E. 
Wines of 144 John Street, Ridge
wood, New Jersey, the Lieutenant 
was graduated from the Depart
ment of Printing in 1942, and also 
took some courses in Management 
Engineering. While at Tech, he was 
a member of Student Council, a 
drum major, and drill master of the 
Kiltie Band. He is a member of Beta 
Theta Pi fraternity.
Lt. Wines was commissioned an 
ensign in the Naval Reserve in 
March 1942. He was then given a 
course in naval ordnance at the 
Washington Naval Yard, and was 
assigned to the staff of Naval In
spector of Ordnance, Long Island 
City, New York.
After applying for submarine 
duty, he was given training at Key 
West and New London, and was 
then promoted to lieutenant junior 
grade. He was assigned to a Pacific 
naval base, where, in September
1944, he was attached to the Tang.
. . . Len Lerman
poor mother, father and brother. 
Fortunately he lived through this 
dangerous stage of scientific explor
ation and eventually won for him
self through the Junior Science Fair 
a scholarship at Carnegie Tech. Here 
he is continuing his scientific pur
suits as a Chemistry (not to be con
fused with Chem. Eng.) major. 
When he graduates Lenny plans to 
enter war research work but as soon 
as conditions permit he will con
tinue his studies eventually earning 
for himself the remarkable letters 
Ph. D.
On the campus Lennys natural 
interest and enthusiasm have led 
him into many activities and, al
though he feels that activities are 
overemphasized and insufficiently 
spontaneous, we feel it our inescap
able duty to mention them. The 
activity with which Lenny is most 
widely associated is the Carnegie 
Technical, a high-class publication 
of educational and informational 
value (I get paid for the plug). As 
a typical Horatio Alger who has 
worked up from general flunky to 
Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Lerman is en
tirely to blame for this magazine.
It seems, however, that the Tech
nical does not absorb all of Lennys 
time or talents for he is also a mem
ber of Activities Council; Discus
sion Club; Tau Beta Pi; Pi Delta 
Epsilon, the journalistic honorary; 
Phi Kappa Phi, scholastic honorary; 
and the Student-Faculty Liaison 
Committee. Activities Council he 
finds to be stimulating but the less 
well known Discussion Club has 
proved to be educational and pleas
urable as well. Yes, Lenny is a busy 
student and you will most probably 
run across him digging into a port
folio of papers and photographs, 
deeply engrossed in a heated dis
cussion, or pondering the problems 
of his newest scientific experiment.
Bill LeRoy Provides 
Music at TEP Dance
The Tecvet Dance, labeled mys
teriously TEP, is scheduled for Sat
urday, March 24th, from eight to 
midnight in Thistle Hall. The music 
will be of a different nature than 
that which we have had at recent 
dances, for an orchestra will replace 
the old juke-box. This orchestra will 
be that of Bill Leroy, the outstand
ing outfit of local renown.
The dance committee is headed 
by Mike Glass, social chairman of 
the organization and includes Joe 
Nutter, tickets; Paul Secher, pub
licity; Bill McKelvry, decorations; 
and Ed Smuts, refreshments. Mr. 
McKelvry has issued a call for help 
with the decorations from any 
painting and design students with 
creative imaginations.
Tickets of admission have been 
priced at $2.40 per couple including 
tax, and may be purchased from a 
Tecvet representative who will be 
present in the Canteen from 11 to 1 
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Fri
day of this week. They may also be 
bought from any member of the 
group.

For those of us who were in it,

is ended. And so, we feel, should 
the collegiate attitudes toward it 
end. Not a few of these kids have

It was originally intended that, 
when the results were published in 
the TARTAN, they would be accom
panied by a composite picture of 
this biological phenomenon, but in 
order to give aspiring campus ar
tists a chance to prove their mettle 
the War Stamp Committee and the 
TARTAN planned a contest in 
which the person who draws a girl 
who looks most like the picture of 
the composite girl, Frantha Collap, 
will win a pack of cigarettes. There
fore, the picture will be delayed 
until next week at which time it 
will be printed along with the best 
sketch submitted by a member of

Next Sunday, March 18, the 
movie, Storm Over Asia will be 
shown by the Outlines Galleries. Di
rected by the well-known Russian 
artist, Pudovkin, and still ranking 
among the most advanced of film 
expressions, the picture deals with 
the exploitation of a poor Russian 
peasant who is discovered to be a 
descendant of Genghis Khan. The 
storm concerns the struggle within 
the man over whether he should be
come a leader or not. There will be 
two* showings of the movie, one at 
7:30 and one at 9:30.

The World Student Service

Contest Still Open 
For CIT Bond Queen
The stimulus of the Bond Queen 
Contest boosted our War Bond sales 
,to $2,173.75, as of last Wednesday. 
An additional $1,254.25 in Bond pur
chases is necessary to buy our am
bulance. The time is getting short, 
so hurry, buy a Bond now and cast 
your vote for the Bond Queen.
Girls, get the official bond blanks 
from the cashiers office between 9 
A- M. and 4 P. M. Then distribute 
them to whoever wants to buy a 
bond. The purchaser then takes the 
blank and it is stamped when 
the Bond is purchased. The stamped 
blank is then returned to the girl 
who turns it in to the cashiers of
fice with her name and department 
and year on the reverse side.
To date, it seems that Jean Gar
land, with $768.75 credited to her, 
will be the Bond Queen. Second is 
Dot Caplan with $78.00 and third 
is Anne Sweeney with $37.50.
This is your big chance girls! To 
be chosen Bond Queen, beauty isnt 
a must. Just be the best saleslady 
of the worlds best investment.

Too many dy/dxs, little green 
slimy logs, simple harmonic mo
tionswe craved culture. The 
quickest, liberal education we could 
think of at the moment was a tour 
through the Associated Artists ex
hibit at the museum.
There are two significant things 
about the main hall worth mention
ingfirst, its big; second, we dont 
like the guard, and incidentally, 
where did Madame Winged Victory 
get the tail feathers? Arousing our 
somnolent friend, the guard, from 
his work,-we forked over twentyfive cents for the necessary pam
phlet, and turned our critical eye 
to the appealing limestone study of 
Henry Burztynowiczs, Calisthenics. 
Freshmen girls will be particularly 
interested in this as an exciting new 
modern dance pose. We might add 
that Henry B, was probably inspired 
by Dali! In the near-entrance, two 
children are supporting a burdened 
motherDotty Kings, Born Shall 
Be the Bearer. An excellent study, 
we thought, also an excellent ad for 
a vitamin pillthis shouldnt hap
pen to you.
A negro spiritualist, by Frank 
Melega, was strictly our man! You 
had the feeling he was going to 
burst out in Deep River any minute, 
and next there is Myopia. My
God! And with that we entered the 
oils. (Not to be taken literally). 
What a place  everything from 
Kennywood Park to Drip! One of 
these is an abstract and the other 
local, but were not sure which fits 
what.
Lt. Richard Wilt exhibited a beau
tiful B-25 job, about the best paint
ing of a bomber done anywhere. Not 
even the rivets were forgotten on 
the fuselage, but unfortunately not 
everyones an aero, and I found my
self pulled off by the scuff of the 
neck to look at some surrealism.
Pittsburghs Golden Triangle is 
really a beaut, along with Coal, Iron, 
and Dreams. About this time some
one screamed, what is it? and we 
turned to find William C. Libbys 
Pilgrimage staring us in the face. 
Bottle Imp, with negligees, wine and 
lace all over it, and Roy Hiltons, 
November Morning compensated 
for aforementioned atrocity, but the 
prize, so we thought, was Theodore 
Allmendingers Subversion! A huge 
grimacing dragon represents war; a 
skeleton under him, the story of his 
devastation; and tiny marching and 
crawling people, the result of his 
terror. The picture tells a whole 
story with dramatic coloring when 
a whole page of sad C-3 awaits my 
arrival home.

TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
TARTAN Reporter Explores the Campus, 
Finds Many Fascinating Places In Unknown
For all you explorers who now 
have had a Turkish bath in the 
steam tunnels; who have lost a 
finger poking at the mechanical 
monsters in Machinery Hall; who, in 
spite of it all, are still licking your 
chops for more of the same; for you 
brave adventurers, we shall con
tinue with the list of campus by
ways. The Fine Arts Building is our 
next territory. Although on the sur
face it appears quite simple and or
thodox, it might be wise to equip 
yourselves with maps, compasses, 
and K rations. In short the Fine Arts 
Building is a mad confusion of 
rooms, halls, doors, stairs, and cub
byholes.
You have all been in the Little 
Theater but have you ever roamed 
around backstage? Have you ever 
been in the cellar where they de
sign sets or in the long, narrow 
dressing rooms or out on the cat
walks? It is oozing with atmosphere, 
this unknown territory behind the 
curtains. You will stumble across 
many a strange item which is buried 
there: spears, horses heads, armor, 
chaise lounges, draperies, vases, and 
even perhaps a stray corpse. There 
are ladders, flats, ropes, and spotlight 
switches; there are long lines of mir
rors in the dressing rooms and 
trunks full of costumes; there are 
creaky catwalks which circle around 
under steel supports and wires and 
low ceilings; there are stairs, halls, 
more stairs, and more halls; and be
fore you know it you are lost. You 
started in the basement and some
how you are on the second floor and 
on the other side of the building. 
But you have been backstage; you 
have had a brief glimpse of the the
aters own private world; and the 
next time you sit in the Little Thea
ter you will remember that vast un
known maze about you.
Another  part of the Fine Arts 
Building seldom visited by strangers 
is the fifth floor. Oh, you didnt know 
there was a fifth floor! Yes, way up 
there under the skylights are faculty 
studios, painting rooms, locker 
rooms,, and the loge. If you have 
never been in an artists studio, vis
it the fifth floor for an artists studio 
is uniqueshelves filled with rows 
of jars and paint cans; piles of old 
paintings and odd frames leaning in 
the dusty corners; a battered table 
or desk hidden beneath stacks of pa
pers, sketches, magazines, letters, 
and all the odds and ends that an art
ist seems to accumulate; an easel, of 
course, an unfinished painting, a col
orful palette, and a bottle bristling 
with brushes; and usually an ancient 
and well worn luxury piece 
of furniturea horse hair sofa, a 
comfortably bulging armchair, or a 
gayly quilted cot. The inescapable 
smell of turpentine is essential to 
the atmosphere as is also the dis
order, the dust, and the complete 
lack of organized beauty.
The painting rooms are likewise 
disorderly and drab with a speckle 
of color where the students of sev
eral generations have spattered 
their paints. Along the wall in a 
variety of colors and letterings are 
the names of the many students 
who have toiled in these rooms, 
many now whose names are famous. 
While you are there, poke your 
head through the skylight. Its a 
glorious feeling to see the campus 
.and city stretched at your feet. 
v Before you leave, glance at the 
current exhibit in the P & D cor
ridors, wander through the inharmoniously noisy music rooms, ride 
the weary and temperamental ele
vator, and pause at the pottery 
rooms. Yes, Tech is a wonderful, 
fascinating place if we would ever 
take time to explore it.

The Legion of Merit has been 
awarded to Lt. Col. William A. Conwell for his services in North Africa 
while serving in vthe capacity of Ex
ecutive Officer of an Engineer AviaPeter Lupori 
tion Regiment. He was graduated 
from Carnegie Tech in 1929 and en
tered the service in January, 1941. 
Since going overseas in 1943 he has 
been in North Africa, Sicily, Sar
dinia, Corsica, and Italy.
Lt. Oechsle, recently returned to 
the United States after 56 combat 
bombardment missions, is now at
tending the fighter transition school 
at the 4th OTU, Ferrying Division, 
Air Transport Command ai Green
wood, Miss. At the 4th OTU, the 
only school of its kind in this coun

fighter planes in thirty days. On 
completion of his course, Lt. Oechsle 
will ferry such planes as the P-40, 
P-63 and others to all parts of the 
country. He left Carnegie Tech to 
enter the service in 1941.
Lt. Peter Lupori, a graduate of
the sculpture department, is now 
home on a fifteen-day leave. While 
in his senior year at C. I. T., he was 
the continuous winner of the New 
York Beaux Arts award. He is rep
resented in the present Associated 
Artists show by two black and white 
pictures. Lt. Lupori entered the 
service on the fourth of July, 1942, 
and is at present stationed at Camp 
Swift, Texas, in the 605th Engineer 
Combat division.
Capt. Robert Craig, a graduate of 
the architectural department, is

Things were sort of at a stand
still around campus last week. The 
fact that the grades came out and 
that nothing too exciting was going 
to happen over the weekend may 
have had something to do with it. 
Therefore, this column will be made 
up of small talk gathered from 
kibitzing bridge games, listening to 
what the people in the booth next

and reading scraps of paper that 
fell out of Soc Rel books or were 
written on blackboards over in Mag

shadow, Ivan Turman . . . who has 
the most beautiful hair (we voted

to New London next weekend.
People were wishing that school 
was over . . . that there wasnt such 
a thing as grades . . . that there 
were more girls like Pat Igo and 
Ann Richards . . . that Ann Shive

Engineer Banquet 
Tickets on Sale
Yes sir, fellows, just a few more 
weeks and the Engineers Thirtieth 
Annual Banquet will be upon us, 
and considering that the time has 
been flying swiftly, it seems that it 
will be here before we realize it. So, 
in case none of the Engineering Of
ficers approach you in the next few 
days with tickets for the banquet, 
they can be purchased from Mr. McKelway in Room 255-C in Industries 
Hall. The price of the tickets is $3.00 
per person.
The Committee has been work
ing hard to accumulate souvenirs, 
favors, door prizes, etc., and the var
ious manufacturing organizations 
are responding readily with suitable 
favors and souvenirs. Some of the 
advertising items that have arriv
ed so far, and that have been seen
and sportsmanship in this game. En
tertainment will be provided by a 
committee. Admission is only 35 
cents. We have just noticed that the 
posters state the time of this affair 
as 8:30. However, we will expect 
you at 8:00 so dont be late. All the 
swimming beauties have their nicest 
bathing suits ready for use and are 
rarin to go. So come on! Last one in 
is ayou know what.

sent the play, The Miser, by Molier at the Little Theatre from 
March 17 through March 26. Even
ing students may obtain tickets 
free of charge in Room 255-C in In
dustries Hall.
These plays have been a source of 
excellent entertainment for the stu
dent body in addition to being a 
means of class instruction for the 
Drama Department students.
by this writer, give me an idea that 
this banquet is going to be as ex
cellent, if not better, than any that 
you fellows have attended in the 
past.
Just as a reminder, Fellows, the 
banquet is to be held in the Gold 
Room of the Roosevelt Hotel in 
Pittsburgh on March 31, 1945 at 
6:30 P. M.

We are starting the column to
night with a gripe. The fellows who 
are working on the publicity com
mittee for the Engineers Banquet 
are complaining that the posters 
that they so diligently made are be
ing defaced. And who can blame 
them. These posters entail a great 
deal of work and time. They ask 
that future posters be left untouch
ed .. . It has been reported that 
Frank Novasaul, who studied Me
chanical Engineering here at Tech, 
has been killed in action in Bel
gium. Frank attended day school 
for two years and then enrolled in 
the Evening School . . . John Hundertmark is now in the Navy Radio 
School at the Navy Pier in Chicago 
. . . Fred Vichichs little girl has 
pneumonia and is in the Pittsburgh 
Hospital. Heres hoping for a speedy 
recovery ... In case you are won
dering about the identity of the two 
lovely girls who escorted Ches Biscup to his Economics Class last Fri
day, we will enlighten youVir
ginia Ehni (the blond whose picture 
was in the last issue of the PLAID) 
and Olive Baumgardner. No doubt, 
you are wondering alsoHow does 
he do it? . . . Arlene McMurray is 
fast becoming the intellectual type. 
Proof of this is the books she is read
ingSilas Marner and Sad Sack
Bulletin Boards and the use there
of is an important feature in the life 
of the institute. Presumably these 
boards were erected with a definite 
purposeto provide space for an
nouncing student functions.
During the past week posters 
were placed on the boards announc
ing the Evening College of Engineer
ing Stag Banquet scheduled to be 
held March 31, ,1945. It has been 
observed that some person possessed 
with a destructive instinct proceed
ed to deface one of the posters to 
the extend that it was mutilated.
A little reflection should make 
this individual conscious that this 
act was defeating the purpose of the 
bulletin boards and it is hoped that 
all notices and display signs which 
may be posted will be respected. It 
does take real time and effort to 
prepare these posters and if some 
individual elects to deface a sign, 
the work may be sacrificed.
. . . Harold Park is back with us 
after his illness . . . You must come 
to the swimming party. There will 
be two special attractionsDoubleUgly and Pudgy-Wudgy. Who 
are they? Its a secret.
