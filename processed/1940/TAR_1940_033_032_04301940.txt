Honors Come 
To Tech Men 
In Math Test
Kaplan Again Is 
Among Top Five 
In Competition
Word has just reached the Car
negie Tech campus that the threeman Carnegie Tech team, including 
Samuel N. Foner, Walter E. Stuermann, and Edward L. Kaplan, has 
received honorable mention in the 
William Lowell Putnam Mathe
matical Competition. This indi
cates that the team ranks no low
er than sixth.
In the competition last year 
there were 41 three-man teams in 
addition to 77 individual contes
tants; Although the exact num
ber of contestants has not been 
announced this year, we may 
roughly say that~there were about 
200 competing.
This competition is sponsored 
by the Mathematical Association 
of America, and is open to undegraduates in the United States 
and Canada who have not receiv
ed a bachelors degree.
Edward L. Kaplan, 41, has dup
licated his performance of last 
year by ranking among the first 
five individuals. As a sophomore 
last year. Mr. Kaplan placed 
among the first five, an unusual 
feat in itself. Due to his success 
Harvard University awarded him 
a $1,000 graduate scholarship 
which awaits him upon comple
tion of his undergraduate work 
in 1941. Kaplan hopes to become 
.a teacher, preferably at his own 
Alma .Mater.
As the TARTAN went to jwn 
word was received that the 
of Merlyn Condit and Paul Fr> 
lander had been withdrawn 
cause of ineligibility.
Call 0s issued

New Play by Dorothy Stewart 
Is Excellent Final Production
Math Teaser
R No. 3. The Problem of the 
Weights. It Is required to find a 
set of eight weights capable of 
weighing to the nearest ounce 
every weight up to and including 
200 pounds avoirdupois, given 
that each weight may be used on 
either pan of the balance, or not 
at all. Also, show that all sets of 
weights (if there is more than, one 
set) satisfying the conditions of 
the problem have the same total 
weight, and that eight is the least 
number of weights which can 
meet the conditions. If anyone 
finds all this too easy, he may try 
to dtermine y/hethr there is 
more than one solution; the pro
poser has not been able to do this.
;ua,it bu MmDi 
This reviewer is not one of 
those who insist that a play have 
a message, political, moral, or 
otherwise. So, in saying that Fol
low The Sun, the new play by 
Dorothy Stewart now being pre
sented at the Fine Arts Theatre, 
is a So what? play, I am not 
condemning it for the absence of 
any sort of propaganda. After all, 
isnt entertainment the first pur
pose of the theatre?
While many parts of Follow 
the Sun are tremendously enter
taining, it lacks the something 
which goes to make a play signifi
cant theatre, (in strictly a dra
matic sense). It may be important 
that, while the work is definitely 
homey the scenes that deal with 
the road are by far the best, by 
far the most moving, and by far 
the most important-seeming. The 
home scenes are skillfullyeven 
cleverlywritten, but the questipn isare they worth writing 
about?
In many ways Follow The 
Sun is one of the best all-around 
productions the drama depart
ment has given us this year. It is 
technically extremely difficult 
there are eight sets and eleven 
scenes, and every one of John 
Blankenchips sets are extremely 
effective and efficient, (And dont 
you think efficiency isnt a pri
mary importance in a show with 
ten scene changes!)
Miss Morriss direction of Fol
low The S'fin is exceptionally, in 
keeping with the play. There is, 
in the direction and in the act
ing, marked contrast between the 
road scenes and the home scenes', 
as there is marked contrast in the 
script.
The play is extremely well cast 
and well acted, and, although it is 
spotty, the high spots are so 
effective and such good theatre 
that we sincerely hope Mrs. Stew
art will consider, for one of her 
future plays, the use of a hobo 
setting entirely, without showing 
the audience the rather dull par
adise that her protagonist has for
saken.
Fashions...
Now that spiing is really (?) 
here, it is time for a new out
look on life, and from the female 
point of view that means a new 
wardrobe. Please dont get the 
idea that you should dash down 
to the nearest department store, 
and order one wardrobe com
plete from hat to shoes.
No, chilluns, take time with 
your selections and insert  that 
note of individuality . to attract 
the eye. Of course, there are 
many obstacles in- your .way. 
Everyone else on campus wears a 
swing skirt, cardigan, socks,, sad
dle shoes, and porky piewhy not 
you, you say.
To answer this question a con
sultation has been held with the 
male authorities in these parts, 
and we come up with the follow
ing facts for your enlightment: 
No girls skirt length should be 
higher than just below the knee
cap!, BUT it would1 be very nice 
to have split skirts introduced 
again.
Hats, says the typical male 
Techite, should cover the head 
and be of a color to harmonize 
with the outfit. Any unique dec
oration such as a trailing feather 
or skillet turned upside-down is 
strictly out. As a last shot, the 
Techite warns, Stick to high 
heels and stockings for better ef
fects. (Girls, be warned.)
If you are dissatisfied with the 
hats that the department stores 
are showing, why not make your 
own? Incidentally, they are also 
great penny-savers. Straw or 
felt crowns of all shades may be 
purchased in any five-and-dime 
store. Add to your base plaid rib
bons or feathers for a sports 
model with either an open or 
closed crown.
For a more formal occasion, add 
an artificial corsage, which best 
matches your dress; namely, white 
gardenias, roses, purple violets. 
Veils also help in making the 
wearer of one of these hats tres 
alluring.

Boys who are not usually fastidi

Since good grooming does make

wise thing for the ambitious sen

taken off at will.
An appearance of good groom

for a long period .of time. Fastidi
ousness imparts a feeling of confi

sories to grooming, such as a nail 
file, clothes and shoe brushes, and 
a deoderant are easily accessible 
at a small price. Of course, things 
like shaves, hair cuts, and fresh,

Next Season
As a climax to a successful sea
son, the Skibo icers were feted at 
a banquet held in honor of the 
retiring Senior members in the 
Old Union. Buddy Overend 
and Max Hannum added to the 
evenings entertainment with their 
witty after dinner comments.
It was announced that the men
tor and one of the founders of 
the sport here at Tech, Coach 
Griggs, had resigned. His suc
cessor will be announced some
time in the near future. We are 
sorry to see Coach Griggs leave as 
are the rest of the student body, 
for he has become a familiar fig
ure on campus and a man whos 
interest in student activities has 
been a constant spur to those who 
know and work with him.
Fred Feiler, considered one of 
the best goalies in the Ohio-Pennsylvania league, was elected Cap
tain of the Skibo aggregation for 
the coming year.
Wilson, Burleigh, Ely, and Shiloslcy are the regulars who will 
be lost at graduation. Herre and 
Ament will also graduate and 
leave two positions for the Juniors 
to fill.
Although commencement will 
take a large toll from the skat
ers there are a host of promising 
Juniors to fill their positions. Feil
er, of course, will tend goal next 
season and Block will tend to one 
of the forward duties. Goldsmith, 
Barker, and Sivachek will fill in 
the other vacancies. We predict 
a better than average season for 
the team and are sure that the 
stickmen of next year will be able 
to fill the shoes of the graduating 
Seniors.

Plebe SquadTHISTLEDOWN
INTRAMURAL ROARD STANDS UP 
UNDER LOADCarnegie Tech will have a 
freshman golf team this year un
der the direction of Buddy Over
end, varsity coach. This frosh 
squad should prepare material for 
future varsity teams, and should 
tend to strengthen Tartan en
tries in link competition with 
other colleges who have been us
ing the freshman team system Jor 
years.
A schedule has been arranged 
for the plebes. On April 20 they 
were slated to meet Shady Side 
Academy, but that match was post
poned. Using Fox Chapel as a 
home course, future contests will 
be: Washington and Jefferson
Freshmen, away; Kiski Prep, 
away; May 10, Shady Side Acad
emy, home; May 17, Kiski Prep, 
home.
Those freshmen who have gone 
out for the team are: DArle
Hindall* Hugo Barbian. Bill McCool, Fred Dietrich, Ward Duchene, Dave Eicher, Andrew Ken
nedy, Don Barrett, Don Sprice, 
and W. C. Malone.
The fact that the turn-out for 
the plebe squad was almost as 
large as that of the varsity proves 
that this freshman golf team will 
fill a necessary function in futux-e 
Tartan links campaigns.

Friday afternoon, the Freshman

to Peabody by a score of 50-45.
Tech took four firsts but lack of 
second and third places lost for 
the frosh. Stairing for the Tar
tans were George Karlitzky with 
a first in the shot put, a second in 
the high jump; Hugh Smith with 
a win in the 440, Marcin with a 
win in the mile.
Tech won the Relay by a very 
close margin. I-Iec Perez got a 
second in the pole vault, and 
Frye got a second in the 440. 
The next meet is against another 
Pittsburgh High School, and if 
the Frosh can gather in a few 
more seconds, they may win a 
victory.

Fussy and Company
Mr. Frank Eyman, the little Big Chief of the Intramural 
Board lias recently announced some of the doings of the Intra
mural Board that should help Carnegie softball players know 
the time and place of their prospective games. First, on any and 
all days on which games are to he played a large American flag 
will he flown from the flag pole, in front of the gymnasium. 
Second, a complete schedule of the days games wrtl be posted on 
the main bulletin board of the gymnasium. This bulletin board 
can be found immediately inside the center door of the gym. 
Still another service to all entered in the softball*competition is 
the printing of the full schedules, these forms being sent to all 
team managers.
Few persons realize .the great amount of work that goes into 
the formulating and carrying out of any intramural program. 
Such an activity as a softball tournament requires much more 
than the usual amount of effort, so to Mr. Byman, Ross Rotzler, 
Willis Anthony, Harry Turner and others of the Intramural 
Board we all owe a vote of thanks for the quiet work they have 
done.
Softball Highlights
Last Wednesday saw the opening of the Carnegie Softball 
tournament, and already many of the highly touted teams have 
fallen to the rear while some of the so-called dark horses are 
now basking in the campus spotlight. Foremost among this 
group are the Delts. In the three contests they have appeared 
they have won one and lost two, however, it is obvious that 
pitching is not the Delt weakness. Big Jim Loehlicad, known 
to all as a swimmer and politician, has been throwing many a 
strikeout ball, but for some reason (unknown to the Delts) the 
opposition has been blasting away at Sir Loehheads seemingly 
effective pitching. The hurling of George Muna has thrown a 
scare into the hearts of many a batter during the past week. 
George and his crew of Sigma Nus, although not first in league 
standing, can certainly be listed as a likely contender for the 
Intramural cup. Our friends in the yellow and black jerseys, 
the Citcom Clan, succeeded in polishing the Freshman Archi
tects the other afternoon by the lop-sided score of 24 to 6. One 
of the revolutionary features of this contest was the pitching of

Dick Gregg Leaves as Tartan Hockey Coach
At the Tartan Hockey banquet, held last Thursday, Dick 
Gregg announced that he will be unable to continue in future 
years as mentor for the Skibo icers. The loss of this good friend 
of Carnegie comes as a shock to those of us who knew Dick as 
the man that he is. Mr. Gregg, a local business man, was one 
of the first enthusiasts to approach the Carnegie Athletic office 
with the idea of a Tartan hockey team. Since his first concep
tion of a Skibo hockey team three years ago, Dick Gregg has 
worked with the Plaid skaters doing his hit to make them a 
better skating aggregation. Now that lie is forced to leave us 
many wonder what will become of the Carnegie hockey team in 
future years. With the close of the school year our school not 
only loses one-half of its hockey team, but also the one driving 
frtrce it has had to keep it together during these lean hockey

Softball Season 
Gets Under Way
SAEs, Theta Xi,  
Kappa Sigs Win 
Opening Games
Intramural softball got off to a 
flying start with 15 games being 
played during the past week. Be
cause two of the Forbes Street 
fields remained in bad shape, only 
four games could be played each 
day, but this week it is expected 
that all six diamonds will be in 
working order.
On Tuesday the fraternity 
leagues opened hostilities with a 
hot fracas between the Betas and 
the Delts, and a contest featur
ing Theta Xi and the ATOs. Ted 
Fisher starred on the mound for 
the Betas by turing in a neat 
hurling performance leading his 
team to a 3-1 victory. The high
light of Fishers air-tight twirl
ing came in the last half of the 
final inning when Merlin Condit 
came up with two out and the 
sacks crammed with Delts. The 
best the mighty Condit warclub 
could do was to ground out to 
end the game.
Theta Xi didnt have much 
trouble taking their encounter 
with the ATOs, winning by a de
cisive 16-4 margin. In an Inde
pendent League fracas the Fresh
man Engineers gave promise that 
they are a power to be reckoned 
with in softball as well as in bask
etball by trampling the Stripped 
Gears, 16-7.
SAEs Beat Betas 
Wednesday found two of the 
tightest frays to date in the DeltTX game and in the SAE-Beta 
contest. The Delts managed to 
eke out a close 13-12 victory over 
the Theta Xi men, while the SAEs 
used a last inning rally to riumph 
over the Squirrel Hillers. The 
tally was 15-10 when the SAEs 
came up for their final turn at 
the platter. Before the side was 
retired seven runs were shoved 
across, most of which were scor
ed after two outs were registered.

From upper Forbes Street

a new cover design over the old 
structure which was not injured 
in the crash. Although not def
initely decided as yet, the pushing

of notables Ted Fisher, Joe .Betz,

According to Walter C. Wilson,

the onlrahco of nine buggies in 
the annual pushmoblle classic 
should boost the popularity of 
the event to greater heights than 
ever before. With several now 
buggies In the Urie-up striving for 
flrst honors the competition will 
prove to be exceedingly keen, no 
one daring to predict a winner.
Last years winners, Kappa Sig
ma, will undoubtedly be fighting 
to repeat their sterling perform
ances of past years. The hopes of 
the Clyde-streeters will be plac
ed in a buggy essentially the same 
in design and construction, and 
it will be pushed by such huskies 
as Lloyd', Howarth, Ingalls,, Gumbcrt, and Stauffer. Flyweight Joe

Answer to Math Teaser
:ii MtbWliv bu MmDi >
It seems reasonable to assume 
that the smallest weight is 1 oz. 
The .fact that the number of 
weights is so severely limited sug
gests that the next one be made as 
lax*ge as pxacticable, namely 3 oz. 
We can now weigh up to and in
cluding 4 oz. The most efficient 
value for the third weight is evi
dently 9 oz.; if it were 10 oz., we 
would as . yet have no 5 oz. com
bination, while if it were 8 oz., we 
would have two 4 oz. combinations 
(l-f-3 and 8-3-1), and one would 
be wasted. It is found that each 
weight after the first is three 
times the preceding, and the sum 
of the eight is just 3280 oz. or 205 
lbs.
The constx-uction of the set 
shows that not a single combina
tion is superfluous. This may also 
be proved as follows. Each weight
has three possibilities: it may be 
used on the right pan, on the left, 
or not at all. With eight weights 
there are then 3 exponent 8 ox6561 combinations. One of these 
corresponds to zex-o weight, or no 
weights at all in the pans; half of 
the remaining 6560 combinations 
represent negative weights, which 
we ax*e not counting, leaving just 
3280 effective combinations. Few
er thaix eight weights would not 
yield this many combinations, and 
so could not possibly meet the requix'ements of the pi'oblem. Also, 
the total weight of the set evident
ly could not be less than 205 lbs., 
and still weigh up to 205 lbs.; 
neither could it be mox'e than that 
amount, because then at least one 
of the indispensable combinations 
would be wasted upon a weight 
outside the required x*ange (0-205 
lbs.).

Next Saturday evening the so
cial calender of this year will be 
brought to a close as Mr. Frank 
Yoking, social chairman, and Joe 
Gummo, his assistant, present the 
W. C. A. E. Airliners for your 
dancing pleasure.
Since the ^Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance which introduced councils 
social programs, to this, the final 
dance of the year, these two men 
have worked hard to present the 
best for the dancing pleasure of 
the students. The list of the bands 
read like a list pf "the districts 
name bands: Brad Hunt, Jimmy 
Earle, Clyde Knight, and finally 
Earl Truxell and his Airliners.
There is a great amount of work 
connected with the prepai'ation 
and presentation of a social pro
gram of this magnitude and Mr. 
Young and his able assistant de
serve the thanks of the student 
body for their fine work.
There are few colleges who can 
boast such a fine program of so
cial events as we, here at Tech, 
are fortunate enough to have. 
Where else do you find dances 
featuring bands of this high cal
ibre for a price as low as $1.00, 
which includes a beautiful corsage 
for your girl friend. Yet there 
are times when I think we are in
clined to take these affairs for 
> granted without thinking of the 
work necessary for their success
ful presentation.
Next Saturday will be your last 
opportunity to show how much 
you appreciate the work of the

Economics I & II 
To Be Scheduled
Students in the College of Engi
neering who are interested in get
ting their complete course in Eco
nomics may do so during a special 
eight week supplementary term 
this summer. If a sufficient num
ber of students are interested, the 
classes will be held. Instead of 
the usual price of $27.00 for one 
semester the charge will be $54.00 
for the 18 units. It will be possi
ble to add 18 units toward your 
degree, however, and get the nec
essary amount of Economics.
This is an unusual opportunity 
for degree students because it en
ables them 1o complete two years 
work in eight weeks. All students 
who are interested in taking the 
course are urged to contact Dr. 
Kenneth Field, head of the De
partment of Economics, at once.

Schenley Hotel 
Is Scene of Silver 
Anniversary Dinner
Last Saturday evening the Mir
ror Room of the Hotel Schenley 
was a scene of much festivity and 
merry making as the Evening 
College of Engineering brought 
their social calender to a close 
I by presenting the annual ban- j quet. It would be hard to imagine 
I a more fitting affair than a ban quet of this type to climax a com| pletely successful social year. 
FrOm the time the boys present
ed their tickets at the door, and 
I received their bags of souvenirs 
and souvenir pencil, until the last 
fellow left the hall the evening 
moved at a fast pace.
Naturally enough the meal was 
the first event of the program, 
and after the boys had consumed 
all the eatables in sight the more 
interesting part of the program 
got under way. Dr. Jones, whd 
handled his duties as toastmaster 
very capably, introduced Presi
dent Doherty, the various depart
ment heads who were present, 
and also Dr. Eddie Baker, the 
football coach. Then Dr. Wagner 
from the Westinghouse Electric, 
and Mr. Anderson of the Alum
inum Company of America who 
shared the roles of principal 
speakers were introduced and 
added a very pleasant hour to the 
evening. After the speeches were 
over the boys prepared for the 
lighter side of the evenings enter
tainment. In the interval dur
ing which the chairs were be
ing moved in preparation for the 
floor show, the numbers were call
ed for the door prizes. The num
ber of prizes donated was so large 
that about every fifth man re
ceived one. Then came the girls 
and for the next hour and a half 
the boys forget all about, school 
and studies as they relaxed and 
enjoyed the show.
The affair was in charge of the 
officers of the College of En
gineering: Mr; Frank J. Young, 
president; Bill Hurt, vice presi
dent" Robert Hull, secretary; and 
James C. Fisher, treasurer, and 
a committee selected from the en
tire college.

Next Saturday evening, March 
4th, the gym will resound to the j 
merry-making of the evening stu- ! 
dents for the last time as council | 
rings down the curtain on the I 
years social calendar, with the j 
presentation of the Inter-College ! 
Dance. This is one of the oldest 
dances on the campus and coming 
as it does, near the end of the 
school year, it is always well at
tended. Then, too, its the last 
opportunity students will have to 
relax and enjoy themselves before 
beginning to cram for those an
nual headaches, the exams.
Airliners Will Play 
To ensure the complete success 
of the evening, council has secured 
the services of one of Pittsburghs 
and the districts best bands, Earl 
Truxell and his nationally known 
WCAE Airliners. Many of you 
have probably danced to the band 
on the campus, or' at one of the 
numerous one night stands they 
have played around the district. 
They have also played' several long 
engagements locally at Bill 
Greens Casino, Hotel William 
Penn, and Kennywood Park: in 
addition to out of town bookings 
at' such popular places as the Ho
tel B'ermudiana, in Bermuda, and 
the De Witt Clinton in Albany, 
N. Y. Any of you who may have 
missed him at any of the above 
places have undoubtedly hpard his 
daily broadcasts over WCAE. The 
band features smooth swing, and 
also the popular young vocalist 
Jeanne Baxter.
Spring: Is Theme 
Spring, oh yes, beautiful spring 
will be the theme of the decora
tions, and the old gym will be 
converted into a veritable fairy
land with flowers, soft lights, and 
the old crystal ballwhy there 
may even be birds flitting through 
the windows. Speaking of flowers, 
the corsages for the girls will be 
the most beautiful given at any 
dance this year. Your best gal 
friend will look twice as pretty 
when shes wearing one of them.
Frank J. Young, social chair
man, and Joseph Gummo, his as
sistant, will be in charge of the af
fair. Since this is a council dance 
you wont need a registration card 
to get in, all youll need will be a 
one dollar bill which, when paid 
at the door, will cover the admis
sion fee.

Gummo Voted 
Into Council
Industries Honor 
Third Year Student
Joseph H. Gummo, who was 
elected treasurer of the Vocational 
Courses at their annual election 
last fall; is serving his first year in 
Evening Student Council. Joe is 
a young brunette of ^medium 
height, with very dark serious 
eyes, and has been conslsently one 
of the most earnest workers ever 
to aspire to an Activities Key. Last 
year he was present early or late 
when there was a job to do, and 
although his work has interfered 
somewhat this year, he is on hand 
at every possible time.
Joe came to Carnegie in 1937 
and Is now enrolled In the third 
year of the Machino Practice 
Course. He is deeply, interested in 
the knowledge imparted In this 
course and feels that he is being 
aided In getting a few rungs far
ther up the ladder of success. He 
is at present employed in the Car 
Shops of the Pennsylvania Rail
road Company.
Baseball and intramural basket
ball were Joes favorite sports in 
high school and he took part in 
them whenever time from his stu
dies would permit. He left a good 
all-around record behind him 
when he was graduated in 1936 
from Scott High in North Braddock.
At least two months of every 
year, Joe spends in the great out
doors, swimming, camping, fishing, 
sleeping under a tent and, in gen
eral, roughing it. This probably 
had its inception in his boy scout 
work in which he has long been 
active. He is Scout Leader of 
Troop No. 51. He likes to organize 
baseball teams' among the scouts 
and enjoys playing the game him
self, whenever he has the opportu
nity.
One hobby has probably led to 
another and through his fondness 
for the woods, he started photo
graphing different wooded scenes, 
and photography now claims a 
large frart of his leisure time.
Joe does not profess to be ex
actly a woman-hater. In fact, he 
is quite civil to them but when 
asked whether he preferred 
blondes or brunettes, he turned 
both thumbs down, meanwhile 
keeping eloquently silent.
Council selected him as assistant 
social chairman and Joe has great 
plans for next year's social calen
dar, especially as to the type of 
orchestras that may be brought to 
the campus.
Me is a member ol Nu Sigma 
Alpha and has earned one Aetivitii's Tnsiunia Awni'd.

Some one has done wrong by 
Fine Arts. Some one has accused 
the boys from Fine Arts of trying 
to run Council. Very serious. 
Very serious indeed, until you sit 
down and analyze the vote that 
made Jimmy Fisher president of 
Evening Student Council for next 
year.
Only two members of the Fine 
Arts, contingent attended the meet
ing where lie- noble work was 
done. It is logical to assume that 
they supported Jimmys only op
ponent, who was a Fine Arts man. 
And following the same logic, they 
must have been the only members 
who did support Jimmys oppo
nent. The vote stood at nine to 
two!
Nine to two! Obviously a man
date from the people, something 
akin to President Roosevelts land
slide of a few years ago and, more 
recently, the overwhelming vote of 
confidence which the Republican 
Party gave to one Jay Cooke. As 
in the case of all beitzkriegs, coup, 
and mandates, it is a little difficult 
to find the individuals who, were 
consulted to aid Council in decid
ing what the mandate from the 
people should be, but Council as
pires us that the voting members 
/sclectecl the candidate which it 
deems most capable, conscientious 
and deeply interested in the stu
dents welfare. Everyone thought 
so except those two Fine Artists 
who were trying to run things 
again..
Now the embarrassing part of: 
fthd whole business, so far as the; 
boys from Fine Arts are concern
ed. is that If word gets around gen
erally that they are running things, 
someone is going to give them the 
credit for succeeding in running 
the show. And they dont; want it! 
In fact, the Impression that the 
Fine Arts boys give in face-toface conversation is that they dont 
approve of the way things are go
ing at all, not at all._________________
Unfortunately, we cannot extend 
much hope to the boys from Fine 
Arts. The way things look from 
this corner, no matter how much 
they want to run things, they are 
not going to until they get some 
support from other quarters. Sup
port takes backbone, and the suspicibn recurs that election to Stu
dent Council weakens most back
bones.
