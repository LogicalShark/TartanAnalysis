Orchestra Features 
Frank Sinatra Plus 
Harmony Quartette
Next Thursday evening at 10 
oclock Tommy Dorsey, His Trom
bone and His Orchestra, coming ' 
straight from a long -engagement 
in New York City, will greet Tech 
dancers at the opening event of 
this years Spring Carnival.
Tickets for this years Carnival 
went on sale this morning at 9 
oclock in Industries Hall. They 
may still be purchased for $5.25.
This will be a return engage
ment at Tech for the Sentimental 
Gentleman of Swing for he was 
here for the same event exactly 
four years ago. At this time Jack 
Leonard and Edythe Wright were 
the featured vocalists. Tommy has 
an entirely new band this time, 
however. With him on this trip 
will be pretty Connie Haines and 
Frank Sinatra (who incidentally 
.sounds a good deal like Jack Leon
ard) and the Pied Pipersa 
harmony quartette he has acquired 
:since last- year.
There will also be many new 
faces in the music section of the 
band. The last time Tommy was 
here, Dave Tough, how with Ben
ny Goodman, was the drummer; 
this year little, black-haired Bud
dy Rich will beat out the rhythm. 
Buddy was with Artie Shaws old 
old band, the one that made "Be
gin the Beguine famous. Ziggy 
Elman, who used to be with Benny 
Goodman, is Tommys ride-man 
in the trumpet section. And, of 
course, there is always the maestro 
himself. Tommy is considered, by 
those who know, to be the best 
trombone player in the land. He 
can reach the highest note that 
has ever been played on that inDoherty Made 
Head of National 
Defense Board
Last Tuesday Dr. Doherty was 
appointed chairman of the Pro
duction Planning Board which is 
under the Office of Production 
Management. Since last Febru
ary Dr. Doherty has been an ac
tive member of a nine-member 
production board which will as
sist in the national defense pro
gram. He replaces Samuel R. 
Fuller, Jr., who recently was ap
pointed chief of O. P. M.s ma
terials branch.
The board of which Dr. Do
herty is chairman, was organiz
ed to advise as to industrial plan
ning during the emergency and 
as to post-emergency adjust
ments. It is active in studying 
the experiences of the last World 
War and the past ten months of 
defense planning, as well as the 
mobilization plans of. the army 
and navy.

The past weeks electioneering will be climaxed today with 
a vote that should be record-breaking1. The major parties have 
been campaigning fiercely and the antithetical platforms, do not 
leave much room for fence-straddlers. The vitalness of each per
son's vote is evidenced by the election last week when the Arts 
Senate presidency was won by the slim majority of five votes. 
Rules similar to those in past elections will be enforced.
The elections today will deter
mine sophomore, junior and se
nior class officers in the three col
leges; Senate representatives for 
the three colleges; three assistant 
secretaries and three assistant 
treasurers for three colleges; and 
vice-president of the Engineering 
Senate. As was done in the last 
class election, a faculty advisory 
board will be appointed by Dr. 
Warden to help Council members 
watch the polls.
The two major political parties 
have prepared a statement of their 
platforms which appears on the 
second page of the TARTAN. 
Time of the election will be from 
11:30 to 1:30, and polllng-places 
are listed elsewhere on the page.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1941
Dont Be A Suckere6GI H4DRT sLRTR3GRDLetter to Editor
Cast Your Vote Now IndependentFraternity
Last year for the first time in about fifteen years, the student 
body awoke to its responsibilities at election time. And the 
strength of the majority was sufficient to deliver a blow to fra
ternity control of student government.
That blow was insufficient, however, because a combination of 
holdover positions and strength in the Arts School loft the frater
nity combine a working majority on Student Council.
At the time of that election many things were said that bear 
repeating now, for this election is a test of whether the students 
at Tech really care what happens to their student government.
The leaders of the fraternity combine last year maintained 
stoutly that the fifteen year airtight control of student govern
ment was justified by the argument that if the other students 
arent interested enough to give up five minutes a year to cast a 
vote, then they dont deserve a voice in student affairs. The ar
gument continued that if the fraternities could use their control 
to maintain themselves in power in the various committees, in the 
Scottie, in the Thistle, and in other school activities they were 
justified in so doing.
Whether this argument is morally just or not is beside the 
point. It is practical, because if the students are too smug to 
care what happens to their government, anybody who wants to 
control it can do whatever he pleases.
Last year many Independents hoped to change the basis of 
representation on Student Council so that it would no longer be 
possiblie for a small group to win every election easily. Because 
they could not win a majority, that plan never reached fruition.
Fraternity men are made to realize their responsibility to 
vote for their organization by being subject to a fine for each 
member of their group who does not vote.
No one can fine the non-fraternity students if they fail to 
vote. But they will be fined a great deal more than that if they 
do not use their privilege, because they will be handing over 
their government to a handful of students to be used as that hand
ful sees fit.
The outcome of todays election hinges on whether we as 
students feel that extending last years gains is worth a few 
minutes of our time.
Clarification
It is possible that there was some misunderstanding about 
the meaning of the letter to the editor printed in Fridays issue 
of the TARTAN. The situation referred to was known to exist 
last year. This year apparently the money involved was returned 
to the Thistle and was included in the budget.
Honorary Points
Jim AVills has announced an extension on the time of handing 
in lists of points for class honoraries. The points will be posted 
as previously announced, but if there is any mistake in those post
ed or if anyone has any additional points they may be turned in to 
Jim Wills any time before Saturday noon.
Spedai Tartan
A special issue of the TARTAN will be published this Friday 
for the benefit of all students and visitors who attend the An
nual Exhibition. A new idea on campus, the twelve-page exhi
bition issue, will include a program for the evening.
Descriptions of the work being done in each department, 
and of the exhibits presented are completely covered. The issue 
will include many ideas for the future, and will be generally in
formative to all. Bo sure to get your copy.-

During the past fifteen years, 
S'tudent Council has been con
trolled by three or four major 
fraternities, popul.\rly called the 
Big Combine. Because of good 
organization, this group could 
and did win every election. Min
or fraternities on campus were 
conveniently overlooked and 
held few offices. The Big Com
bine controlled elections by us
ing fixed athlettic cards, voting 
more than once, and counting bal
lots to suit themselves. For ex
ample, last year, when the TAR
TAN printed photostatic evidence 
of faked athletic cards, the Big 
Combine stole over 2,000 TAR
TANS in an attempt to keep this 
knowledge from the students. 
THIS IS THE FRATERNITY 
SYSTEM: KEEP EVERYTHING 
QUIET BEFORE ELECTIONS; 
PREVENT STUDENTS FROM 
KNOWING THE FACTS.
Each fraternity man who does 
not vote in this election will be 
fined $5. With this well-oiled ma
chine to supply the votes, coupled 
with a policy of keeping the stu
dent body uninformed at all costs, 
the fraternities hope to reestab
lish their strangle-hold on stu
dent government.
This mad scramble to get back 
into the saddle reveals fear, fear 
of what a democratic student gov
ernment might mean. Let us look 
at a few accomplishments of the 
Independent Party .during the 
past year:
1. Reform of Mens Honorar
ies; 2. Insurance of honest elec
tions; 3. Reduction of the rates on 
checking concessions, and taking 
these out of the hands of the 
Dragons; 4. Elimination of the 
buying of Spring Carnival tick
ets in fraternity blocks.
The Independents attempted to 
reduce the $500-a-year salary of 
the treasurer of Student Council, 
but failed because of lack of a 
majority.
Last Friday, the Debating Un
ion planned to sponsor a Town 
Hall forum in order to bring to 
the student body both sides of the 
campaign. Bill Floyd, although he 
commented favorably on the idea 
when it was presented at the Stu
dent Council meeting, refused 
along with Charles Richardson, to 
speak for the fraternities. Due to 
the failure of the fraternities to 
cooperate, the plan had to be 
dropped, although Les Cullen had 
agreed to speak for the Independ
ents. The Combine admits that 
to bring the election issues before 
the students is to cut their own 
throats'.
The Independent Party wishes 
to have an informed student body 
.and a representative student gov
ernment. A vote for the Inde
pendents is a vote for genuine
During the school year 40-41, 
we, the student body, have wit
nessed several revisions in our, 
form of student government. These 
revisions have essentially been the 
result of increased interest on the 
part of the entire student body in 
the responsibility which it shares 
in establishing a suitable system 
of student governance.
No one will question the 
heaithfulness of this situation. In
creased student participation has 
forced the diverse political groups 
that exist to define and clarify the 
stands that they choose to take on 
issues vital to the interests of our 
school . As a result, an efficient 
system of compromise has devel
oped. The Fraternity faction rec
ognizes the integral role that the 
Citcom and the Dormitory groups 
have played in helping to readjust 
the governmental structure which 
we enjoy through their coopera
tive efforts. However, the coming 
elections will truly serve as evi
dence of the amount of progress 
that we have made during the past 
year. If we permit ourselves to 
vote merely as our political affili
ates dictate, we shall defeat the 
purpose for which we are striving, 
that is, the creation of a truly rep
resentative student government.
The Fraternity group has held a 
majority of the major campus of
fices in previous years. This sit
uation may be attributed to a va
riety of circumstances according to 
the inclinations of the observer, 
but in reality, it is merely a mani
festation of the active participa
tion which this group has evi
denced consistently in campus ac
tivities.
This faction has again selected 
a group of men, whom they be
lieve to be the most capable and 
the best fitted for the various stu
dent offices, as their candidates in 
the coming campaign. This group 
sincerely believes that they have 
chosen men who will conscien
tiously strive to serve the dictates 
of the entire student body. How
ever, the Fraternity group will 
give their utmost cooperation to 
those men whom the student body 
indicates for these positions.
The Fraternity policy propounds 
to ameliorate student differences 
by closer cooperation between the 
various campus political groups, to 
augment the present intra-mural 
program and make it apply to a 
larger proportion of the student 
body, and to facilitate the expres
sion of student opinion through 
the organ of student publications.
When you cast your ballot, re
member that it is an instrument of 
representation and that it is in
tended to be your vehicle of ex
pression in your student govern
ment.

To the Editor:
I am sorry that the squabble 
over the TARTAN editorship 
must be further dragged out in 
print. However, I cannot pass up 
without protest the slanderous 
story in the Cut which posed as 
a presentation of the facts.
If I had any reason to believe 
that the writer of the story were 
over twenty-one, I would certain
ly consider a suit for libel.
Whoever wrote the story for 
the Beta-PiKA newspaper was 
not content with innuendo. He 
resorted to deliberate and inten
tional falsification of the facts. 
The writer claims that I advocate 
more favorable treatment of 
Communists making me a sub
versive member of the SPCA, I 
suppose.) This sounds strange as 
a reason for removing me from 
the TARTAN, since at the discus
sions at Student Council which I 
was permitted to attend, the word 
Communist was not even men
tioned.
The only editorial which even 
mentioned the Communists was a 
strong criticism of them, as any 
literate person could discover by 
reading it. They considered my 
criticism strong enough for a 
special Communist leaflet attack
ing the editorial policy of the 
TARTAN. On this particular 
question, Mr. Tom Riley and the 
Communists see eye to eye.
The Cut fails to mention the 
fact that fully half of the Stu
dent Council members who voted 
to oust me apologized before and 
after for their action. According 
to them they were voting to oust 
the editor only because Dr. 
Warden and Dr. Doherty insisted 
that this be done. If these stu
dent council members were ly
ing, then the entire business is 
simply an attempt on the part of 
the big fraternities to discredit 
the TARTAN and hamper its ac
tivity because the TARTAN re
mains the one major activity on 
Campus of which no group can 
boast control.
If the members of student 
council who allegedly supplied 
the Cut with its facts would 
have the moral fibre to permit an 
open discussion of exactly why 
and how things happened the
facts would soon be cleared up.
If Mr. Riley and the persons 
v/ho determine the (Jut poncy are 
really solicitous over uncover
ing the facts I suggest they ask 
their fraternity brothers on Stu
dent Council why a legal petition 
for a Student Assembly is being 
studiously ignored.
Sincerely yours, 
LEONARD SHATZKIN.

Fraternities Prepare
For PiBsliinobile Sweepstakes
By Don Watkins
Around the first of April all 
fraternities start to think about 
the Pushmobile races, which take 
place during Spring Carnival. It 
is the one. time of the year when 
the engineers are convinced that 
the few classes they attend are 
not entirely in vain, because the 
construction of the buggies re
quires real engineering ingenu
ity. This years buggies from all 
outward indications are going to 
be no exceptions.
Kappa Sigmas pride and joy 
will be entered again with the 
hopes that it will repeat the last 
five years record. It is essential
ly the same vehicle as in previous 
years, and from all that we can 
gather it will be the same red 
and white construction as before.
Last years contribution from 
the Betas was a dream of en
gineering prowess and it will be 
again entered this year with a 
few minor changes made, such as 
cutting away part of the alum
inum frame to make it lighter 
and therefore easier to push 
around the course. It will prob
ably have the same bright cov
ering of aluminum, and with 
these few changes the boys on 
the hill hope to increase their 
booty over last year by taking
not only the design award but 
also the cup for the race itself.
Delta Tau Delta is also enter
ing essentially the same buggy, 
which consists of a hollow weld
ed steel frame. It is a very light 
buggy and has a very good chance 
for the cup.
The Du.s have a tricycle buggy 
designed by Howard Cole with a 
rather high center of gravity.
Although the Phi Kaps have 
not entered a buggy for at least 
five years, they have big plans for 
this year. It is to be a three 
wheel job with a steel frame and 
they are thinking of putting a 
colored plastic covering on it.
The ATOs have a buggy with 
a wooden framework and no cov
ering. It is to be one of the few 
four wheel buggies in the sweep
stakes.
PiKA evidently has something 
very hot on the fire because we 
cannot find anything about it ex
cept that it will be the same bug
gy changed so that it will not 
crumple before it reaches the top 
of the hill.
The Theta Xis are building a 
new buggy with almost the same 
construction except that they will 
have a covering this year.
Sigma Nu is entering no bugby this year.

CARNIVAL SPORTING EVENTS
Howling Finals
PiKA Pinmen Beat Delts, Win League A; 
Campus Awaits Match With Citcom
The match which determined 
the winner of bowling league A 
was rolled last Saturday. The 
reason for this post season match 
was the fact that the Delts and 
the PIKA's were tied Cor the 
number one position. The results 
were exceedingly close and show 
that both teams were of the win
ning caliber.
To illustrate the narrow mar
gin of victory the first game was 
won by exactly 2 pins697 to 695, 
in favor of the PiKAs. The sec
ond game went to the Pikers, 688 
to 681. Game number three saw 
the turning of the score, going to 
the Delts, 688 to 639. With the 
winning of the first two games 
goes the league A title to Pi 
Kappa Alpha.
Rudolph was high man for the 
day, adding to the Pikers score 
was his three game total of 476.
The second high goes to Durbin of 
the Delts with a 458.
There is still one bowling 
match to be rolled before this 
season's scores are placed under 
the heading of history. And that 
is the one between the Citcom 
Clan, winner of the "B league 
and the PIKA's. This contest will 
be one to watch, that, is, it is 
anybodys fray, and will be of 
the utmost interest. Even though 
the Clan has bowled over all its 
opponents in good style and the 
PiKAs have come from behind 
to top their respective leagues, 
both stand on equal footing at 
this time. The school title will 
be a feather in either teams hat 
and will be most worthwhile. 
Not only will the winning of the 
title be fine for its own sake, but 
also because of its effect on the 
Intramural Point Trophy, for 
both teams are in advanced 
standing positions.

Citcom Clan, SAEs 
Lead in Leagues
Aided by the fine Spring 
weather the intramural softball 
program got off to a flying start 
last week. Playing three games, 
the Citcom Clan tossers have 
forged ahead of the field by turn
ing in victories over the Metal
lurgists, Soph Engineers, and the 
Frosh of Section 2. The SAEs, 
with Murphy, Sughes, and Fritz 
alternating on the mound, took 
over the Delts, 9-8, on Wednes
day and came back on Thursday 
to shellac the Sigma Nus, 24-5.
The PiKAs gave the men of 
Sigma Nu their initial trimming 
on Tuesday to the tune of 16-8, 
but their scheduled fray for 
Tuesday with the Kappa Sigs was 
postponed. Beta Theta Pi took 
the measure of the Beta Sigs, 21- 
8. Also opening their campaign 
on Tuesday, the Transfers spot
ted McGill a ten run lead and 
then came back to win 12-11, 
when Wally Sadauskas came on 
the mound and completely silenc
ed the bats of the dorm men.
On Wednesday the Senior Me
chanicals took on the Frosh Sec
tion 2 squad and hung on them 
an 18-5 defeat, while over on 
the cut the Tau Delts hammered
out a 15-9 triumph over the DUs.
Thursday found the Tau Delts 
trying to make it two straight at 
the expense of the Phi Kaps, but 
last years champs proved too 
much for them, the men from 
Morewood Place winning out 
17-7. The Delts came back from 
their loss at the hands of the 
SAEs to down the ATOs by the 
narrow margin of 8-7. Delta Upsilon also made a comeback by 
mowing down the Beta Sigs by a 
17-7 count. The Betas didnt get 
a chance to down the Theta Xis, 
the measles beating them to it.
This afternoons schedule finds 
the Transfers taking on the Frosh 
of Section 1, McGill Hall meets 
Scobell in an inter-dorm clash, 
the Metallurgists play the Soph 
Engineers, Citcom Clan clashes 
with the Senior Mechanicals, the 
SAEs tackle the Kappa Sigs, and 
the ATOs are slated to meet the 
PiKAs.

Jacobson Tells All
Einar Jacobson, this years master of Carnegie's Carnival 
Week, has just announced several of the more important sporting 
events that are to appear on this seasons calendar of events.
Many of the contests sponsored this year are annual events 
that have proven themselves by past performances to be worthy 
of continuance, while one or two of the planned Carnival contests 
are Jacobson innoventions that should prove to be interesting. 
Foremost of the time-honored Carnival events is the Canoe-Tilting 
contest to be staged in the Panther Hollow Lake. This contest 
is to.be held on the last day of Carnival, and should serve as a 
pleasant climax to this week of activity. Any member of the school 
is eligible to compete, entries being due anytime before the begin
ning of Carnival Week. According to present plans entries 
should be left in the Student Council office. As in past years the 
competition will be between two-man teams, the winning squad to 
be presented with a suitable award.
The school table tennis championships will be held on the 
various mornings during Carnival Week. Contests have been 
scheduled for mens and womens single matches, mens and 
womens doubles events, and a series of mixed doubles contests. 
Once again all entries are due in the Student Council office before 
the beginning of Carnival Week.
One of the Jacobson innovations that promises to be 
worthy of interest is the planned softball game between the sororit3r girls of the Arts school and pretty Maggie Murph. The old 
Swede Jacobson tells us that plans are progressing rapidly, and 
that the sisters of both colleges are more than confident as to the 
outcome of this classic.
First Golf Match Wednesday
Tomorrow at the Pittsburgh Field Club the Carnegie Tech 
Varsity Golf Team opens their current season with the golfers 
from Geneva College. In all probability the first six men will be 
the mainstays of last seasons varsity sprinkled with several ol! 
the more experienced men of last year's freshman squad plus one 
or two upperclassmen who have just qualified for the team. As 
in the past two seasons the Tartan golfing aggregation will be led 
by Jack Ellen, with John Shymowsky, George Tondorf, Paul 
Loveday, Harry Sacks, and Randall Burch sticking close to his 
heels.
The surprise of the current season is the excellent form shown 
by newcomer Red Burch who in his first qualifying round 
paced the field with a low 74. With the rest of the team showing 
the same brand of golfing skill the prospects for the coming 
season are exceedingly - bright.

To meet, to know, and then 
to part is the sad experience of 
the student heart.
Thats an old saying to many 
of you Im sure. Ive known it 
myself for a long time, but un
til now Ive never realized the 
truth it holds, for Im leaving 
Tech.
Im leaving all the friends Ive 
made through the years Ive spent 
here. Friends who have become 
a part of my life, always beside 
me, and always ready to extend 
a helping hand. Ready to share 
my joys and sorrows, asking 
nothing in return for their help 
or sympathy.
Im leaving all the organiza
tions and activities Ive been per
mitted to join or take part in. 
Theyll always be close to my 
heart, for next to the scholastic 
training I have received here, 
theyve given me real training.
Im leaving all the old famil
iar sights and buildings. The long 
lines at registration, the crowded
dances, the drama department 
plays, the hard benches in the 
administration building, and last 
but not least Mr. McKelways 
smiling face.
Im leaving all the fine instruc
tors, but Im leaving the knowl
edge which they successfully gave.
Im leaving th Plaid, and my 
staff who have faithfully served 
me, and made my year of work
ing with them a most pleasant 
one. I sincerely hope that our ef
forts to give you a good paper 
have been worthwhile, and sin
cerely hope that I have not trod 
on too many toes. I meant no 
personal affront to any person or 
group, anything which I have 
printed I believe, but I could 
have been wrong, tooIm only 
human.
Yes, Im leaving all these 
things but Ill never forget them. 
Theyll always be listed among 
my most pleasant memories. Tech 
may soon forget me, but I will 
never forget Tech.

Come on you studentstime to 
unlimber your purses and dish 
out two dollars for your ticket 
to the twenty-sixth annual Even
ing College of Engineering Ban
quet. No, you dont have to be an 
Engineer to attend. We know that 
a great time will be had and so 
we simply cant restrict it to En
gineers.
The price isnt high because 
heres another bargain, exclusive 
to the Tech campus. For two dol
lars, you get a delicious dinner 
at one of the largest hotels in the 
citythe Schenley Hotel. In ad
dition ito this, there are souvenirs 
by the dozens, pencils, scales, 
booklets and door prizes. You 
should see the door prizes. Bookends, lighters, textbooks, slide 
rules and anything else you can 
think ofall these things, not to 
mention speakers and entertain
ment by well-known entertain
ers in the Pittsburgh district. So 
you see, your two dollars will be 
well spent because where else can 
you get ,so much for so little 
money.
The Engineers Banquet has al
ways been a boon to bargain 
hunters for twenty-six years. It is 
one of the oldest traditions on the 
campus and for twenty-six years 
men have gone away satisfied. 
The Engineering officers are cer
tain that this year more men will 
go away better satisfied than ever 
before. So, whose next to put 
their money on the line for the 
Engineers banquet.
All Departments 
Will Open Doors 
Friday Evening
This Friday evening the entire 
school presents its thirty-fifth an
nual exhibition, as has been the 
custom since the founding of Car
negie Tech.
Although the exhibition is 
scheduled from 7:30 to 10:00, the 
program will begin at 7:00 oclock. 
At this time, the R. O. T. C. will 
hold a dress parade on the camp
us adjacent to Morewood Avenue. 
The Kiltie Band will assist and 
if the weather permits will also 
play a half-hour program of con
cert music near the Tech flagpole 
in front of the Arts school.
One of the highlight features 
of the evening will be steel-mak
ing in miniature which will be 
demonstrated for the public by 
the United States Steel Co. 
Worlds Fair exhibit, recently 
presented to Tech. The exhibit 
consists of the blast furnace, open 
hearth and rolling mill process, 
and has been set up in the first 
floor of Engineering Hall.
Interesting sights will be found 
in all departments throughout In
dustries, Engineering Hall, Ma
chinery Hall, Margaret Morrison, 
Commons, and Fine Arts Build
ing.

Scholarship Fund 
To lie Enlarged
On this Saturday evening the 
members of Nu Sigma Alpha 
Fraternity, their guests and 
friends will gather for the Spring 
Memorial Scholarship Fi nd 
Dance in Thistle Hall. It is the 
semi-annual open affair which 
the fraternity holds to secure 
funds for the Robert B. Leighou 
Memorial Scholarship Fund 
which the organization has spon
sored for several years.
The Committee in charge of 
arrangements has selected Ches 
Walters and his Orchestra for a 
return engagement to play at the 
dance. The band has been heard 
on the campus on several occa
sions this year and each time it 
has pleased the dancers. The se
lection of this orchestra for- the

The Art's College brought their 
social events to a close last Sat
urday evening. The crowning 
event marked the end of a suc
cessful season.
The decorations were really 
dilforent. The revolving crystal 
ball refloated dancing lights into 
every part of the room. The Gym 
was in rod. Speaking of red, the 
arts school must be in the red" 
after giving such a grand dance 
program. The college also gave 
beautiful corsages to the lucky 
early 200 couples.
The dancers enjoyed swinging 
and swaying to the music of Joe 
Revel and his orchestra. This is 
the first appearance of Joes or
chestra on the campus. The or
chestra has played over several 
local stations. Jack Keller, the 
handsome vocalist, won all the 
girls hearts. He graduated from 
Taylor Alderdice. Another local 
boy made good, and another or
chestra made good on the camp
us. You probably will dance to 
their music next school year.
Thanks, Fred Fargotstein, Pres
ident; John DeLuca, Vice-President; Robert Metcalf, Treasurer; 
and Lou Fosner, Secretary, for 
the efforts put forth through the 
year to make each Arts event 
individually a success.

working as a draftsman.
Bob is only five feet four and

greatest delight during his studies 
at Tech came last year when he 
finally found someone shorter 
than he. The women are usually 
far from his thoughts except the 
first two weeks in August, which 
he spends down Georgia way.
Bob was called to the Nu Sig
