a Mr. Richardson said that the adI ministration, several of the fac
ulty, and some outsiders had ap
proached him since the TARTAN 
had come out Tuesday morning 
concerning the assembly at which 
Mr. LaFollette is to speak. At 
the time the paper was published 
the meeting had not yet been ap
proved by Council. The TAR
TAN was wrong to publish this 
notice without official recom
mendation, and Dr. Warden sug
gested that the new editor and 
his staff be given an official rep
rimand and be warned not to let 
this recur.

In order that the incoming 
freshmen will not be in a daze 
from fraternity rushing, a preseason rushing booklet is being 
published by the . fraternities 
through Interfraternity Council.
The sixteen page magazine will 
contain articles written by Pres
ident Doherty and Dean Warden, 
welcoming the freshmen coming 
to Carnegie Tech and wishing to 
consider the advantages of join
ing a fraternity. Mr. A. J. Mur
phy, Financial Counsellor, has 
written an article on the cost of 
belonging to a national frater
nity with regaid to room, board, 
and dues. In other sections of 
the magazine there will be ar
ticles, illustrated with pictures, 
on the various phases of the life 
of a freshman in a fraternity 
house. The magazine contains 
pictures of active men on the 
campus, program for Freshman 
Week, and names of fraternities.
Davis Ross, 43, chairman, is in 
charge of publishing the magazine 
aided by Mike Bosak, 42, and Ed. 
Munyer, 43.
The main purpose of the mag
azine is to give the freshmen 
a better opportunity to consider 
and discuss with their parents as 
well as friends closely connected 
with fraternities, the advantages 
of joining a fraternity before they 
come to Carnegie Tech.
These magazines will be issued 
to all accepted freshmen some 
time in August.
Sponsors Will Aid 
Freshmen Under 
Orientation Plan
One of the foremost problems 
facing the incoming freshman is 
orientating himself in his new 
surroundings. A program has been 
drawn up by the Student Council 
Orientation Committee, under the 
chairmanship of Paul Wines, 42, 
to assign the freshman to upperclass sponsors who will assist him 
in finding his place at Tech.
A committee to conduct a com
prehensive, year-long, student ori
entation program is provided for 
in the plans submitted to Student 
Council Intra-departmental meet
ings throughout the year will be 
arranged, for the purpose of fur
thering the freshmans interest in 
his department and to facilitate 
his meeting both the other fresh
men in his department and also 
his departmental staff instructors.
The Orientation Committee and 
the department heads are to select 
a Sponsor Committee composed of 
a number of Juniors and Seniors 
to help the freshman. In the 
spring, the committee will assign 
to each sponsor four freshmen 
who have registered in the spon
sors department. Each sponsor 
will be expected to contact his 
advisees during the summer by 
mail, or personally if possible. 
This plan will provide someone 
ready and willing to answer the 
freshmens questions.
Professor Work is chairman of 
the faculty committee cooperating 
with the Student Council Commit
tee.
Seniors Are Ducked | 
By Underclassmen
Senior ducking time arrived. 
Slowly, stealthily at 9:30 Thurs
day night, the instigators moved 
about gathering recruits. The field 
lights were turned on and the 
hoses made ready. Pass keys had 
already been obtained to aid in 
getting the seniors out. Then a 
mob of underclassmen sneaked 
into Henderson Hall to get Walt 
Moore, the first to be taken and 
just about the last to get to the 
field of battle.
Then came Welch, where all the 
seniors were persuaded to come 
peaceably by the size of the ever
growing mob of belligerents. Boss 
Hall also yielded without a fight, 
the only disappointment being 
that big Pete Dobrus was not at 
home.
Scobell Hall lent all the excite
ment with its terrific resistance 
from all quarters. Trouble first 
started in Jim Sions room where 
he and two other defenders began 
making it tough for the under
classmen. Huge Bob Church high
lighted the evening by manhandl
ing about a dozen men' who had 
invaded his room before he fin
ally consented to having his arms 
and legs tied. The action in his 
room lasted about ten minutes, 
at the end of which period sev
eral fellows, not including Church 
had sustained numerous cuts and 
bruises.
The other captives were led 
out of Welchs clubroom, where 
they had been stored during the 
Scobell trouble, and down to the 
field of honor. The resulting fight 
was cold, wet, and muddy, but 
all had a good time, including the 
victims. All came away wet, but 
happy about the whole thing.

The Mathematics Club will 
conclude its second year of activ
ity with a banfuet Saturday. At 
this last banquet meeting Dr. Em
erson M. Pugh, of the Department 
of Physics will speak on the sub
ject of Modern Physics.
The banquet will be held in the 
Carnegie Inn at 6:30 P. M. Mem
bers of the faculty, members of 
the club, and all others interest
ed are invited to attend. The cost 
of the dinner will be one dollar 
and the reservations may be left 
at Room 200, Engineering Hall or 
with any member of the club.
Throughout the year the group 
heard and discussed papers pre
pared and presented by members 
of the club on various branches 
of mathematics. Officers who led 
the organization throughout 1940- 
1941, were Edward L. Kaplan, 
president; Ralph E. Beatty, vice 
president; Walter E. Stuermann, 
secretary; Norman H. Painter, 
treasurer, and Professor J. B. Rosenbach, faculty advisor.
Notice
The Carnegie Tech Executive 
Board has appointed a commit
tee of Dr. W. N. Jones, chairman; 
Dr. B. E. Warden, Prof. W. E. 
Hitches, Prof. W. R. Work, and 
Mr. C. Wangeman, to give advice 
and counsel to students affected 
by the Selective Service and 
Training Act.
The committee will instruct 
such students as to how Selective 
Service rulings apply to their in
dividual cases.
Freshmen, sophomores* and 
juniors who desire information on 
their college status, to be present
ed for consideration by their Se
lective Service local boards, are 
urged to consult immediately with 
their department heads or a mem
ber of the above committee.

The national officers of the Pi 
Tau Sigma, the national mechan
ical engineering fraternity, have 
just been announced in The 
Condenser-the official publica
tion of the fraternity. Carnegie 
Tech was especially fortunate in 
that Professor Thomas Gemmili 
Estep, Professor of Mechanical 
Engineering, was elected National 
First Vice-President.
In addition to the above honors, 
Mr. Estep has also been selected 
as the editor of the Condenser 
for the ensuing three years. The 
first issue under the Estep editor
ship was dedicated to Carnegie 
Tech. This action was takeh since 
it was decided at the last annual 
convention held hi November, 
1940, that the 1941 convention 
should be held at this school.
At the recent convention Mr. 
Lloyd T. Andrew, Instructor in 
Mechanical Engineering, was 
elected as an honorary member 
of Pi Tau Sigma. He is a gradu
ate of the Colorado School of 
Mines, and came to Tech in 1938.
Tartan Itetrncts 
LaFollette Story
Last week the TARTAN carried 
a story to th effect that Phillip 
LaFollette would speak on Cam
pus. However, the information 
was a bit premature. Student 
Council okayed the talk with 
the proviso that a member of the 
"Aid to Britain Committee 
speak on the same program. No 
action was forth coming from the 
Aid to Britain Committee; con
sequently, the proposed talk fail
ed to materialize.

Tech Sculpture 
Student Awarded 
Special Mention
Peter J. Lupori, Sculpture 42, 
was the recipient of a special 
mention award in an annual com
petition sponsored by the Ameri
can Academy of Rome.
This competition is open every 
year to unmarried men under 31 
who submit one painting or a 
plaster figure or group. Photo
graphs of previous works are al
so required. Previously, the win
ners of the annual awards In 
painting and sculpture bocame 
fellows of the Academy and wero 
able to study several years with
out . expense at its building In 
Rome, Italy. However, since the 
war has made this .impracticable, 
the Academy decided this yonr to 
award cash prizes of $1,000 each.
Lupori submitted a statue of a 
Greek slave girl which he entitled 
Helot, and as a result he re
ceived special mention for the 
workan honor which only three 
other competitors received. All the 
entries were on exhibit at the 
Grand Central Art Galleries in 
New York, and they were judged 
by two juries, one in painting and 
one in sculpture. The $1,000 award 
went to a Missouri boy, but we 
are safe in quoting Mr. Ellis of thesculpture department in saying 
that Pete has an excellent 
chance of winning the big award 
next year.
Pete, before his present hon
or, has won first and second priz
es in the annual Scholastic ComSJ petition in Pittsburgh, and he has 
also exhibited some of his work 
in the Associated Artists annual 
exhibitions. Because of his abil
ity, he received a scholarship 
from the Scholastic Competition 
which he used in coming to Tech, 
and for the past two years he has 
held a Founders Scholarship.Resume ol Years Events at Tech
By Walter Haller
With this issue, the Tartan rings 
down the curtain on the school 
year 1940-41. The past months 
have been eventful ones, and de
serve a curtain call in the form of 
a brief resume of the events of the 
year on the campus.
At Carnegie Tech, as well as at 
most colleges throughout the 
country, campus events have been 
overshadowed by the repercussion 
of the wars now in progress 
throughout the world. Many of 
the most significant happenings of 
the past school year have been 
definitely related to the war emer
gency.
Tech Aids Defense Program
As the year opened, the student 
body was much concerned about 
its relation to the new draft law. 
Dr. Doherty, however, urged men 
students not to interrupt their 
college plans because of the miliassured, in a departure from long
standing policy, that tuition and 
other fees would be refunded to 
draftees on a pro rata basis.
Later it was learned that the 
student body was not the only part 
of Tech eligible for service in the 
emergency. In February, Presi
dent Doherty was appointed to a 
nine-member production board to 
assist in the national defense pro
gram. Major C. B. Stanton gave of Paul Wines, 42, hazing has 
up his duties as professor in the been abolished, and a system of 
Civil Engineering Department to * individual sponsors for incomdevote his full time to administra
tion of Carnegies new program of 
engineering training for national 
defense. In April, the appoint
ment of Director Webster N. Jones 
to the state Council of Defense 
was announced.
Faculty Setup Revised
Students entering in September 
were greeted by a reorganized Ad
ministration. A Division of Stu
dent Personnel and Welfare was 
organized, with Dr Berle E. War
den as its Director. Mrs. Charles 
Yon assumed the post of Assistant 
to the Dean of Women, due to the 
absence of Dean Mary Watson 
Green, who was stricken seriously 
ill. Among other important 
changes has been the appointment 
of Dr. Willard E. Hotchkiss as di
rector of the newly-organized Di
vision of Humanistic and Social 
Studies. This appointment filled 
the vacancy created by the death 
last fall of Dr. Roscoe Ii. Ihrig, 
who for many years was the di
rector of the Division of General 
Studies.
Student Council effected several 
reforms, notably in freshman ori
entation and in class honoraries. 
Largely through the tireless efforts
ing freshmen has been initiated.
Other important issues discuss
ed by Student Council were the 
Council Treasurers salary, and 
the editorial policy of the TAR
TAN. After much debate, the 
treasurers salary remained the 
same. The editor of the TARTAN, 
Leonard Shatzkin, was dismissed 
because of an editorial policy 
which found disfavor with the 
Administration, and because of the 
April Fools issue of the TARTAN, 
which allegedly caused the school 
much embarrassment.
Social Year Outstanding:
Socially, the year was a success. 
The performances of Tommy Dor
seys and Dick Rogers orchestras 
during Spring Carnival climaxed a 
year which saw Bob Chester, 
Johnny Scat Davis, Bobby 
Byrnes, George King, Bunny Berigan, and Vincent Lopez join the 
parade of name bands to the 
Carnegie Tech campus. Congrat
ulations are in order for the offi
cers of the Freshman and Sopho
more classes, who promoted their 
class dances so successfully that a 
profit was returned to Student 
Council.
Exercises to Begin 
Willi Senior Ball 
In Gymnasium
Each spring the Seniors look 
back at the past four years with 
a touch of sorrow that it is all 
over, but the excitement of Com
mencement soon overshadows this. 
The graduation exercises this year 
begin with the Senior Ball. It will 
be held on May 31 in the Gym 
from 8:00 till 12:00 P. M. and will 
feature the music of Bill LeRoy 
and his orchestra. All Seniors 
will be admitted free, and any 
others who wish to come are wel
comed, but must pay $1.00 if they 
purchase the ticket prior to the 
dance and $1.25 if the ticket is 
purchased at the door. Tickets 
may be obtained from Mr. Davis, 
at the Registrars Office, from Mr. 
William Floyd, or the Senior Class 
PresidentsMr. Sions, Mr. Wills, 
and Miss Gillis. Summer formal 
dress is required, but there are no 
restrictions as to the type of 
formal. It should be noted that 
corsages are strictly taboo!
The Presidents Reception will 
be held on Sunday, June 1, in the 
College of Fine Arts from 4:00 to 
0:00 in the afternoon. All of the 
Seniors and their parents are in
vited. At 8 oclock Sunday eve

A Few Closing Remarks
Most of 118 today are beset by two major problemsFinal 
exams and the International situation. If Hitler will be so kind, 
wo would like to settle our problem of exams first. Afterwards, 
Mr. Hitler.
On page one will be found a notice from the Advisory Com
mittee on Selective Service. Those individuals that are or will be 
affected in the near future, please read, and act promptly. Inval
uable aid may be extended to you.
A bit premature perhaps, stillAt times we hear complaints 
that certain items have not appeared, that editorials are not up 
to par, and that other items appearing in the paper are not of 
sufficient interest to warrant their publishing. Strangely, all com
plaints and objections never reach us directly, buf come to our 
attention by hearsay and general rumor.
. If, for any reason, anyone feels that a certain news item, a 
definite editorial or feature should be included, we will judicious
ly review all suggestions and comments which may be submitted. 
Certainly, we have every right to expect that any contribution or 
criticism be made in channels set aside for that purposethe Let
ter to the Editor and a personal interview.
Many members of the administration and faculty, including 
President Doherty, are devoting a great portion of their time to 
national defense. Although their first duty is to the students and 
to the school, in the present emergency, our country claims pri
ority of service. Be considerate and appreciate their sacrifice and 
endeavor.
Once againGood Luck on the Finals!
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Mr. Leonard Shatzkin,
Honorary Editor 
Exhibition Edition of Carnegie
Tartan 
Carnegie Tartan
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Dear Mr. Shatzkin:
The Committee on Annual Ex
hibition has unanimously voted 
that an expression of appreciation 
be tendered to you and the other 
members of the Carnegie Tartan 
staff for conceiving and executing 
in a manner which reflects high
est credit . on the Institute your 
Exhibition Night edition of the 
Tartan.
In the opinion of the Exhibi
tion Committee, the Tartan spe
cial, edition proved by far the 
most impressive program in the 
history of Exhibition Night. The 
technical excellence of the edition 
bespeaks intelligent planning and 
months of work. Without excep
tion, the selection of subjects, 
manner of presentation, pictures, 
and the make-up were handled 
with skill and judgment. Commit
tee members have received many
compliments on this job as an 
outstanding achievement of col
lege journalism.
As you know, one of the de
sires of the Exhibition Commit
tee for some years has been to 
obtain more student participation 
in the Exhibition. The voluntary 
proposal of the Tartan staff to in
corporate the Exhibition program 
in a special edition, together with 
articles of general interest about 
Carnegie Tech, represented the 
ideal type of mutually valuable 
participation which we are seek
ing.
The Exhibition Committee 
hopes that the incoming Tartan 
staff will be interested in emulat
ing the work, which you pioneer
ed, for the Exhibition of 1942. 
We wish to thank you and your 
staff most sincerely for your help 
to our Committee and for an im
portant service to Carnegie Techs 
Annual Exhibition.
Sincerely yours, 
HAROLD L. LANG,
Chairman, 
Committee on 
Annual Exhibition.
Books By Tech Profs
Latest of a long series of books 
to be published by members of 
the Carnegie Tech faculty this 
year, is "Photoelastlcity, written 
by Dr. M. M. Frocht of the Me
chanics Department.
Publication of this book will 
make nvailable to American en
gineers and students of engincerhplete treatment of the 
cticnl methods and the 
irn practice in two-clinitrnaionul photoelnslleity.
"Photoelastlcity" will be the 
first book to be published in Am
erica on that subject, and as stat
ed by Dr. Frocht, In the preface, 
The present work is primarily 
for engineers. It has a two-fold 
aim: to provide a text for courses 
in photoelastlcity and to serve al
so for self study or reference.
Dr. Frocht has been concerned 
with research and the teaching 
of photoelasticity for the past ten 
years. He has developed new 
methods, perfected techniques, 
designed special equipment and 
published some twenty research 
papers on the subject.
Plumbers Plan Picnic
This Friday is the date set for 
the annual Plumbers picnic at 
North Park. Students of all four 
classes who are electing the 
Plumbing Option will meet in the 
Pipe Shop in Machinery Hall at 
1:30 P. M.
The Seniors will take on the 
other members of the department 
in a softball game. Refreshments 
are also promised.

Energetic Herbert Reichdark
haired, 5 foot 9, and better known 
as Herbie to his numerous ac
quaintancesis probably most 
distinguished for his capability as 
Business Manager of this years 
TARTAN. Every Friday afternoon 
he could be found bustling around 
the TARTAN office, telling the 
staff whether there would be 
enough advertising for a six-page 
issue or that the paper would 
have to struggle along with four 
pages for that week. During his 
reign he was notorious for mon
opolizing the telephone, long lines 
of staff members putting in their 
requests for Herbie to get off the 
?!? phone.
Herbies greatest pride and joy 
is the style show which he so suc
cessfully promoted this last 
fall. Despite the popularity of 
the show, he still thinks that 
Techitesand especially Engin
eersshould be more style con
scious, and hopes that Tech-inColor will be perpetuated to ac
complish this.
It is also his opinion that both 
the TARTAN and marriage are 
lasting institutions. He is quite 
an individualist in his likes, pre
ferring Zazu Pitts, W. C. Fields, 
Baby Ruths, real blond hair, and 
heart-rending music played by
An authoritative book on Insu
lation of Electrical Apparatus, 
considered to be of particular val
ue in the industrial defense effort 
has been published by Dr. Douglas 
F. Miner, George Westinghouse 
Professor of Engineering at Car
negie Tech.
The book, outcome of ten years 
industrial and laboratory research, 
establishes faulty insulation as re
sponsible for about 85 per cent of 
the breakdowns of electric power 
apparatus. It assembles the first 
comprehensive discussion of cor

principles and of methods of test
ing insulation efficiency.
Dr. Miner, who is in charge of 
the Carnegie Tech-Westinghouse 
cooperative scholarship plan, was 
led to preparation of the book 
when he discovered that no suit
able text-book existed for teaching 
power machinery insulation, now 
of vital importance to the vast 
power-driven industry working on 
defense efforts.
Much of the material was ob

Brain Teaser...
If the reader happens to re
member the story of Alice 
Through the Looking-Glass and 
is willing to admit it, he may re
call that after passing through 
the looking-glass Alice found her
self in a strange land divided in
to squares like a chessboard, and 
inhabited by chessmen, among 
others. In the story, Alice, who is 
regarded as a pawn, relates how 
she progressed from square to 
square, always looking forward 
to the time when she would reach 
the eighth row and become a 
queen.
We shall present our heroine of 
the looking-glass with a more 
difficult task. Let her try to start 
out at a square in one comer of 
the board and make her way to 
the square in the corner diagonal
ly opposite, subject to the fol
lowing conditions. First, she must 
enter each square on the chess
board once and only once; and

secondly, she must not move di
agonally from one square to an
other, but must always move di

Compile a Good 
Winning Season
By John Lindbcrc
Last Tuesday and Saturday the 
Carnegie Tartan track team con
tinued on its way as the only un
defeated Tech varsity team this 
year. Tuesday they defeated 
Bethany College by a. score 67 :v 
to 58% in the Carnegie Bowl. 
Carnegie amassed most of its 
points by gathering seven firsts 
and nine seconds to dominate 
Bethany on an ideal day for a 
track meet. First places for Tech 
were taken by: Sarantopolusone 
mile and two mile runs; Simbolli 
440 yard dash; Karlitskyhigh 
jump and discus throw; Haupt 
880 yard run; Churchjavelin 
throw; Karlitsky with twelve 
points, Sarantopolus with ten, and 
Church with eleven were the 
high point team for Tech.
Varsity Beats Geneva 
The varsity again scored an
other triumph Saturday by show
ing Geneva the way with a score 
of 68 to 58. This constituted their 
fourth straight victory in as many 
meets. Out of fourteen events 
the Tartans gathered nine first 
places and five seconds. First 
were taken by Sarantopolus in 
the mile and 880 yard run, Church 
in the shot put, Pash in the 100 
and 220 yards dashes, Simbolli in 
the 440, Marcin in the two mile 
run, Perez in the pole vault, and 
MacLaughlin in the low hurdles. 
Incidentally, this was the first 
.time Watt, from Geneva, was. de
feated in the low hurdles. High
light of the meet was Pashs dou
ble victory in the 100 and 220 
yard dashes combined with Pete 
Sarantopoluss twin win in the 
mile and 880.
Not much attention has been 
given the track team this year, 
but they can rightfully be called 
Techs most successful team. At 
any rate they deserve much more
support than they are receiving. 
Tuesday they meet Grove City 
there, and then Saturday the 
boys journey to Beaver Falls for 
the Inter Collegiate Champion
ships. We believe the boys really 
deserve some praise.
Plebes Lose to Shadyside 
Almost keeping up with their 
older brothers, the Tech Plebes 
lost to Shadyside -and won from 
Westmghouse last week for a 
record of three wins against one 
loss. While the varsity were de
feating Bethany last Tuesday, the 
Frosh journeyed to Shadyside 
Academy, where they were over
come by a score of 83 to 30. Un
able to match the boys from 
Shadyside, Tech had to be satis
fied with one first placeBob 
Whitesides five points in the shot 
put. Tech compiled a list of 
seven places, three by Whiteside 
and one each by Lindberg, Phillipchuck, Vollbrecht, and Prit
chard. Whiteside was high poini 
man with fourteen to his credit. 
The most thrilling race was the 
mile run in which Hume of 
Shadyside beat out Frank Prit
chard by a bare yard. Shadyside 
swept the 100 yard dash, the only 
event in which they were able to 
do it. It is well to notice that 
Shadyside had to break a good 
number of records to overcome 
the Freshmen.
Beat Westinghouse 
However, the Plebes bounced 
back to win decisively over West
inghouse High School by a score 
of 61 to 25 last Friday on a cool, 
rainy afternoon. The times were 
very good considering the ugly 
condition of the track. Westing
house was only able to take one 
first place the 100 yard dash, but 
Tech compensated this by almost 
monopolizing the mile run, shot 
put, 440 yard dash, the low hur
dles, high jump, and discus. Again 
Whiteside starred for the Fresh
man, this time being high point 
man with eighteen markers. The 
Freshman have one more meet 
this year, and we again think that 
we are correct in saying their 
record is most successful.

Tech played two golf matches 
with Grove City last week, one 
on Wednesday and the other on 
Saturday. The first was here and 
the Saturday meet was away. The 
Tartan divot-diggers lost two very 
close matches to the Grove City 
team.
The Skibos first team won its 
match 2 to 1 by breaking a tie 
by winning best ball. In the sec
ond foursome George Tondorf and 
Harry Sacks both tied their 
matches, but this time Grove City 
broke the tie by winning best ball. 
The score of this match was Tech 
1, Grove City 2. Techs third 
team, composed of John Shymosky and A1 Gubey, lost 3 to 0. Shymosky lost his match 4 and 3, and 
Gubey lost his one down. Grove 
City won best ball 2 and 1.
In the first foursome of the sec
ond meet with Grove City Jack 
Ellen won % point and lost 2% 
points. John Shymosky who con
stituted the other half of Techs 
first team repeated Ellens rec
ord. Tech was represented in the 
second foursome by George Ton
dorf and Chuck Klimas. Tondorf 
won one point and lost two, and 
Klimas won all three of his points. 
Harry Sacks of the third team 
won % point and lost 2% points.
Both meets were very close with 
Grove City winning the first meet 
6 to 3 and the second 9% to 8y2. 
In the first meet, four individual 
matches were tied out of six. The 
second meet was seven closer than 
the first with the final result not

Between the clouds which hov
ered over the courts last week 
enough brightness fell on Grove 
City to allow the Grovers to take 
their match with the Carnegie 
Netmen last Saturday, to the tune 
of 7-2. The wins for Carnegie 
came from the number 4 and 5

National Collegiate Golf Competition
Word has been received by your editor that the 44th annual 
competition of the National Collegiate Golf Association will be 
held as usual this year at Columbus, Ohio, on the Ohio State Uni
versity Golf Course. This series of matches is open to all amateur 
college golfers that were eligible for their varsity teams in spring 
competition, but not to freshmen, the competition covering a pe
riod of six days, from June 23-28.
Phi Kappa-Citcom Softball Game
The play-off for the all-school championship of softball which 
was scheduled for last Thursday was postponed until the begin
ning of this week, due to cold and wet weather. The Phi Kaps, 
winners in the fraternity league finals will battle the Citcom 
Clan who won their place in the final competition by defeating 
the Transfers last week to the tune of 9-2. Much can be said con
cerning this game since the majority of the Transfers are Senior 
Civils who had an inspection trip to the Duquesne Brewery im
mediately preceding the game. It has been rumored that the de
feat may be directly attributed to this joyous inspection trip since 
the Civils played a very erratic brand of ball.
At the time of the papers going to press the game has not 
been played, so your editor will go out on a limb and predict the 
Phi Kaps to repeat as school champions and also pick them as the 
best all-around team I have seen in three years at Tech.

good standing. Our most humble apologies are extended to these

Contest Is the 
Fourth of Series 
For Divot Diggers
On Sunday, June 8, the Fourth 
Annual Golf Tournament will be 
held. Originally scheduled for 
June 7, the tourney will be held 
on a Sunday because of so many 
working on Saturdays.
The course has not as yet been 
elected, as it is the wish of the 
committee to select a course cen
trally located to those who want 
to play.
Last years golf tourney was 
played at Butlers Golf Course 
and was won by Tabor Deklewa 
by virtue of a 78. Other scores of 
the winners were Pete Rollinger 
80, Steve Marcinizyn 83, Andy 
Anderson 85. For those who are 
shy because of being in the duffer 
class, the high score last year 
was by Bud Rose who won the 
booby prize with 128.
Whether youre a pro or a duf
fer, come on out and play. Its all 
in fun and a swell chance to lim
ber up the squeaky bones and 
brush out the winters cob-webs. 
Of course there will be prizes.
Those wishing to play should 
contact Steve Marcinizyn. Ad
dress him at 135 Dorothy Street, 
East Pittsburgh, or telephone Val
ley 2569 during the evening. In
formation should contain name, 
address, telephone number and 
preference of golf course. Ac

x-egarding final selection of course 
will be sent out promptly.

In the spring there are quite a 
few calls; those made by the mov

pired, and by the bill collectors at 
the end of the month, but the call 
that all men must heed is the call 
of Uncle Sam to serve a years 
training in the Army. According 
to the latest report from the 
Registrars office, the following 
men have answered this call: 
From the College of Industries, 
Earl Peter Freilino, Carl Butya, 
Earl Kenneth Armstrong, Edward

may see these fellows back on 
the campus after their training is 
completed.

Amuso Represents 
Engineers During 
Council Sessions
Vice President 
Holds Office 
For First Time
Frank C. Amuso, Vice-Presi
dent of the Engineering College, 
was born in Pittsburgh and ac
quired his secondary education at 
Schenley High School from which 
he was graduated in 1934. In Sep
tember of the same year he en
tered the Engineering College at 
Carnegie Tech to study civil en
gineering and now looks forward 
to receiving his certificate in that 
course in June, 1942.
Although this is Franks first 
year in Evening Student Council, 
he is far from being a stranger 
to those active on the campus. 
Three Activities Awards have 
been' won by him in addition to 
his receiving the Council schol
arships from the school since his 
entrance here. 1-Ie became a mem
ber of Nu Sigma Alpha fratern
ity in 1936.
As one of a group Frank is 
rather quiet until he becomes 
well-acquainted but his friends 
know him to be a really good fel
low. He is of medium stature, has 
dark hair, and dreamy dark eyes. 
In his company one feels that he 
is' envisioning his future feats in 
the engineering world and that 
compared with his accomplish
ments, Boulder Dam will be in
significant. His present vocation 
is drafting, and he has been em
ployed in that .capacity for the 
past two years in the office of 
Benjamin H. Aires, Civil Engin
eer.
 iball was his one activity 
l school and he continues 
8 interest In it now, and 
at every opportunity-. He 
also swims quite a bit and likes 
to dance to sYhooth music.
When asked about the fair sex, 
Frank was rather noncommittal, 
but it has been noticed that he 
does give the brunettes a decided 
advantage over their light-haired 
sisters.

Final Event
Council Affair 
Ends Social Season
Last Saturday evening the last 
Council Dance of the year was 
held in the Gymnasium, and the 
sounds of gay laughter issuing 
from the building attested to the 
enjoyment of the hundreds of 
couples who attended it.
The walls were festooned with 
decorations of pastel colors which 
were seen again in the myriad 
facets of the crystal ball which 
has become a tradition at Even
ing School dances on the campus. 
The bright colors of the young 
ladies dresses, abetted by the 
color scheme used in the Gym, 
laid the foundation for an even
ing which appeared to be a hap
py one for the dancers.
All space in the Black Cat was 
filled to overflowing during the 
evening, and it was so crowded 
at most times that the couples 
stood along the stairway, enjoy
ing delicious sundaes, cones, and 
"cokes between dances.
Clyde Knight, in his inimitable 
style, produced music that was 
reully right. Of even tempo, ,it 
was so smooth and melodious that 
the dancers appeared to be eth
ereal, floating rather than glid
ing through the measures of his 
waltzes. The fast numbers re
tained their melody and the rhy
thm was perfect. Popular songs, 
Including many requests, were 
sung by the vocalists, Janet Lee 
and Herb Rohrer.

Teaser Answer . . .
Y.4N.B RC L4A. r 
According to the statement of 
the problem, Alice- can leave any 
given square in not more than 
four different directions, which 
may be called north, east, south 
and west. Let the number of 
moves which Alice makes in each 
of these directions be denoted by 
N, E, S, and W, respectively, and 
suppose that she is trying to get
from the northwest corner to. the 
southeast. Then we must have: 
(E-W) = 7 and (S-N) = 7.
But the total number of moves, 
S -}- E -}- N + W, is 63. Adding 
these| three equations gives 
2(S + E)  77. Since an even 
number, 2(S -j- E), cannot equal 
an odd number, 77, the assump
tion that a solution exists is false.
