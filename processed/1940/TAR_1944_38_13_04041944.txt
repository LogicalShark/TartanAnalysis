The Carnegie Tartan
Alpha Kaps, Tri-Gams, DUs 
Win Greek Sing and Swing
Vibrating melodies from its high ceiling, the ornate Urban Room on 
the top floor of the William Penn Hotel was the scene last Saturday eve
ning of the annual revival of Techs Greek Sing and Swing. Sing and 
Swing, in spite of this setting, contain a less care-free, festive note than in 
the past, for this ye&r many of the fraternities were not represented by 
singing teams, and those that did enter competition were plagued by 
having small groups.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1944
iZitosAtUHcJutiHMilitasuf, ZdUtosi Sft&cJiA.
As one of the points in our edi
torial program we mentioned last 
week an attempt to eliminate the 
various shortcomings of Carnegie 
Techs faculty, curriculum, and 
mannner of teaching. We believe 
that we might accomplish this to 
some degree by discussing in this 
column each department and each 
major subject with possible sugges
tions for improvement. We are con
vinced, however, that far more 
benefit could be derived by a round
table discussion at which both mem
bers of the faculty and the student 
body would participate. This could 
be done by an immedite revival of 
Dr. Dohertys student conference 
group in the form of a joint faculty 
and student council with the aim to 
plan now what improvements 
should be made after the war.
There is little doubt that in spite 
of the present quality of this school, 
much can still be done to make it 
even better. Some courses seem to 
most students utterly superfluous, 
others could be taught in a different 
and much more efficient and pleas
ant manner, and as letters in the 
last Carnegie Alumnus have shown, 
many students and graduates see a 
need for changes in the curriculum.
If we want to institute these im
provements after the war we should 
lay the groundwork right now by a 
democratic discussion of the prob
lems. Students alone could not do 
this; no one still in college has the 
perspective necessary to determined 
the relative importance of various
subjects. On the other hand the fac
ulty cannot be expected to know the 
reactions of the student body to 
their courses and manner of teach
ing. A joint group would comple
ment the experience of the faculty 
with the opinions of the students, 
and each problem could be effec
tively discussed from all possible 
sides.
The faculty-student planning 
group would fill another just as im
portant need. It would bridge the 
gap which at the moment stands 
between the student body and the 
administration. Today, when Car
negie Tech is struggling for sur
vival, the students are indifferent 
or even resentful towards the ad
ministration, and the latter is but 
too often lacking in cooperation in 
matters concerning school affairs. 
The following letter is a tragic re
flection of the situation. The writer 
has experienced so many instances 
of lack of cooperation on the part of 
various departments that now he is 
more or less taking for granted that 
the Drama Dept, called a special 
rehearsal on Spring Carnival night 
only to spite the students.
If the administration will take im
mediate steps to institute the student-faculty planning group all this 
bitter feeling could be eliminated, 
for with the institution of such a 
council the administration would 
say to us: We are in this fight to
gether, and neither of us can sur
vive without the help of the other. 
Let s stand shoulder to shoulder and 
tackle the problems as eauaK
Letter To The Editor
Dear Editor:
As I sit at my desk this Friday 
evening I wonder just what kind of 
school spirit the Drama Department 
of Carnegie has. I, as well as many 
other students, was cheated out of 
my Friday night Carnival date with 
a girl from the Drama Dept, be
cause a play had to be rehearsed.
Surely an all-school affair such as 
Carnival which comes only once a 
year, and which will probably be 
the last one for the duration, de
serves the support and cooperation 
of all departments; yet the Drama 
School saw fit to force their stu
dents to attend crew and rehearsal 
on Friday night. I happen to know 
that a teacher went so far as to 
call a girls parents to assure that 
she would not cut rehearsal to at
tend the dance.
One rehearsal is not going to 
make a play a success or failure. 
Would even the rehearsal be a suc
cessful one when the students are 
forced to attend? Would they try 
their best to portray their roles 
when they are thinking about the 
good time they might be having at 
the dance? I rather doubt that the 
rehearsal was of any value.
If the Drama Dept, has a good 
reason for calling a rehearsal the 
night of an all-school affair, I would 
like to know it. The Drama school, 
being one of the smaller parts of the 
Institute, surely can do their part to 
make an affair such as. Spring Car
nival a success by not calling classes 
.or forcing th'eir students to attend a 
rehearsal.

Pass The Salt, Please
As the war has progressed, and 
th Allied Nations have met with 
reverse, and victory, and then re
verse again, we have becdme cog
nizant of the ever-growing size of 
the forces of People Who Know 
What Its All About. We have been 
treated to the growing importance 
and noise-making ability of those 
who are not hesitant about express
ing their opinion on whatever sub
ject they may choose. The fact that 
their information is usually incom
plete or biased does not concern 
them. They form their opinion from 
a compilation of third or fourthhand news, and thereupon set out 
to sway the world.
Characters such as these exist in 
all walks of life; there is no group 
which lacks them. Ordinarily, 
. though, they are insignificant be
cause they lack the means for 
spreading their ideas to more than 
a comparative few. These we need 
not consider. We shall confine our
selves to the few  and the impor
tant.
In days gone by, freedom of the 
press was exercised through the 
medium of the edtorial column. To
day, however, with' the commer
cialization of newspaper work, the 
presentation of personal opinion has 
been largely taken over by the syn
dicated columnist. To these honor
ed few, the world doth pay homage. 
He counts his readers in the mil
lionsa far greater number than 
that of any single editor. His in
fluence is not local; it is nation-wide, 
and, in some cases, world-wide. His 
word carries weight far beyond its 
true value, and is accepted by too 
 many people without question. His
personal viewpoint, substantial or 
otherwise, is taken as Gospel.
Take for a case in point, the con
troversy over the importance in air 
power, and in particular, the dispute 
over the value of bombing Ger
many. After several-straight months 
of blasting the Reich with every
thing the Air Forces had, announce
ment was made that German pro
duction had been cut 15%. Imme
diately several of these self-styled 
omniscients began to decry the 
waste of men and equipment 
which brought no better than a 
15% reduction. What had been de
stroyed, they did not consider. They 
assumed, with all their ingrained 
logic, that it had been the intent 
of the Air Forces to knock out Ger
man production completely. That 
no announcement to that effect had 
been made did not concern them. 
Without foundation, they assumed a 
motive and smeared across the 
newspapers of the country the one 
wordfailure. Apparently, though, 
there is a slight variance some
where. The responsibility for the 
conduct of the war is held by mili
tary commanders. They do what 
they think will best hurt the en
emy. Theirs is all the information 
that is to be had. Germany is still 
being bombed.
In judging the news, one thing 
must be kept in mind: nothing is 
official unless so marked. Military 
leaders do not formulate their move
ments on headlines of hometown 
papers. Opinions are interesting, 
and continually open up new lines 
of thought; in that way they are 
invaluable. But facts are still facts, 
and the organization with the great
est supply of them remains the Mili
tary Command of the Allied Na
tions.

Nurses Aides Needed 
-Enroll Immediately!
The Red Cross Volunteer Nurses 
Aide Corps has issued an appeal for 
help. They need volunteers  you 
and girls of your age, so that those 
schoolmates and those companions 
of yours who are fighting this war 
will not suffer for lack of aid. In 
our hospitals, Nurses Aides are 
needed because of the number of 
nurses who have left to serve in the 
Armed Forces, and because the ill 
and wounded are being returned to 
our hospitals Tor care. It is for this 
reason that the Nurses Aide work is 
important and a real help to hos
pitals and communities. The train
ing and experience is of great value 
for the future, and, while giving an 
urgently needed service,* each Aide 
becomes better prepared for future 
demands. .
The Red Cross Volunteer Nurses 
Aide Corps is asking you to help to 
defend the home front by enrolling 
in an accelerated course of training, 
which will be held during vacation 
five days a week for a six hour pe
riod, from 9:00 a. m. to 3:00 p. m. for 
three weeks. Part of the time will 
be devoted to class work, the re
mainder to practice in the wards. 
The age requirement is eighteen 
years. Enroll now, since classes 
must be planned in advance. For an 
interview, telephone Grant 1680, or 
apply at Nurses Aide Headquarters, 
Wabash Station, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
This is another opportunity to give 
evidence of your support. ^

In this, our first venture into the 
man on the street type of column, 
we decided to ask a simple question, 
What single quality, above all else, 
would you look for in a mate? Odd
ly enough each of the answers was 
entirely different, which is surpris
ing in a venture of this sort. The 
place naturally enough was in and 
about the canteen. Lights, camera, 
question!
Professor Swanson
The first to be interviewed was 
Professor F. Curtis Swanson (5945 
Fifth Avenue). Associate Professor 
Swansons first answer was prac
tically impossible, Very attractive 
and intellectual. When we reminded 
him that only a single quality was 
called for he noncommitally re
marked that she be herself.
The second victim was Miss Adele
F. Lipkin (4916 Forbes), a sopho
more dramat.
Signalman 3rd Class John Feeney
We left signalman Feeney trying to 
explain to his buddies the meaning 
of his answer and looked for some 
bewildered Engineers upon whom 
to bestow the horror of appearing in 
the Tartan. We found Edward C. 
Peetz, Electrical Engineering Fresh
man, (704 Shady Dr. East, Mt. Leb
anon) leaning over a bridge table in 
search of a fourth. When we asked
 Miss Adele F. Lipkin
We grabbed Miss Lipkin and a 
friend coming out of the canteen 
and asked our question. The first re
action was, Oh, I dont know. 
Then, Of all the questions, Oh, 
gee, and finally the two girls went 
into a conference and came up with, 
He has to be a man. With this 
final remark still being batted about 
by the breeze we ran into the can
teen in search for further subjects.
Signalman third class John Pat
rick Feeney was% busily wrestling 
with a pinball machine when the 
long arm and spherical flashbulb of 
the press gently attached itself to 
his shoulder. His answer was short 
and concise, Honesty; I guess hon
esty will cover everything I want.I
Mr. Ed Peetz
him our question, he looked for a 
slide rule to hide behind. Not find
ing one, he answered our question. 
What single thing would I want in 
a wife? I dont know, a good cook 
I guess! Add beauty to that, a good 
cook and beautiful! Since the ques
tion required only one answer we 
assume that Mr. Peetz thinks quite 
a bit of his stomach.

Urban Room was soon crowded with 
dancers.
Nearly every couple, exhibiting 
the usual curiosity between dances, 
saw the shiny stairs leading upward 
from one of the halls and investigat
ed their ending. Upon finding the 
kitchen above, they all descended 
with approximately the same dis
gusted look. Another popular pas
time during intermissions was look

ed, however, in choosing the best 
sorority team, since, in the opinion 
of the judges, Gamma Gamma Gam
ma and Alpha Kappa Psi were tied 
for first place, the only time in the 
history of Greek Sing and Swing 
that such a situation has occurred. 
The problem was solved by giving 
each sorority a permanent cup and 
leaving the girls to fight it out over 
who would retain the rotating cup 
this year. Alpha Kappa Psi sang 
Blue Skies, All The Things You 
Are, and Alpha Kappa Psi; while 
the Tri-Gammas gave out with a 
Noel Coward Medley.
Brad Hunt and his boys moved 
back in shortly thereafter, and 
Swing rolled on until 1: 00 A. M.

TUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Due to the extreme importance 
of the news in this issue, it was 
decided not to make it an April 
Fool edition.SPORTS
The Grandstand
By Sy Corwin
In the strictest sense bridge is not 
a sport, but since journalists cant 
put it on the front page or the so
cial page and certainly not on the 
obituaries, they shove it into some 
corner on the sports page.
Now with that in mind dont let 
anyone tell you that Carnegie Tech 
isnt'sportminded because they just 
havent been to the canteen yet. 
Dont get the idea that the game is 
something  new here. Its quite a 
long established fad which faded 
out when Skibo and the Beanery 
were closed to civilians and had 
been hibernating until the canteen 
was opened.
Of course, if it hadnt been for 
that Culbertson guy, bridge would 
probably be pretty dull. After your 
partner had trumped your ace, you 
couldnt lunge for his neck and 
scream at him, Ely says not to do 
that. In fact the Army ought tcf 
investigate the possibility plasma 
from the blood that is spilled in the 
course of an afternoon at the can
teen.
Getting to something more seri
ous, however, its about time that a 
bridge tournament was held. Al
though it is already too late this 
semester, there is no reason why 
there cant be one during the sum
mer. With a prospect of almost 
complete inactivity on the campus, 
it would stimulate the spirit of the 
few civilians and ASTs that will 
remain here. A good publicity cam
paign is all that would be needed to 
arouse interest among students. 
Furthermore, at almost all the fra
ternity houses there are fellows who 
have played together for some time.
With the old semester rapidly 
coming to a close, the intramural 
board should have some very defi
nite plans formed for a successful 
program of sports for the coming 
semester. One of the things that 
a lot of students are concerned 
about is the possibility that the 
school may not realize the desire
Date For Ping Pong 
Tournament Moved Up
The proposed army-civilian ping 
pong tournament that the intramur
al board had scheduled for this 
week has been postponed for a 
short time. The original entry dead
line date of March 31, as announced 
in last weeks Tartan, was too close 
and therefore the intramural board 
has delayed the tourney and extend
ed the entry date. A new deadline 
has not been definitely set as yet so
for an intramural softball league. 
Although its very plain to every
one that t>he fraternities are going 
to be hard-hit between semesters, 
nevertheless, there will be enough 
men left in most houses to put up 
a team, and they may be further 
reenforced by the possibility of a 
large entering freshman class soon. 
Already some fraternities have be
gun to practice, showing the desire 
of many students for a softball 
league.
entries will be accepted until fur
ther notice, in Dean Murphys office.
A few more details about the pro
cedure to be followed have been 
revealed. Contrary to the usual 
practice in tournaments of this type, 
there will be no cedings and no 
byes. The reason for this is that 
the intramural board has no way of 
knowing who the best players are 
and therefore cedings would be pure 
guesswork and might make the 
tournament unfair and worse than 
if there were no cedings at all. So 
the oponents will just be picked at 
random, and this makes it the type 
of contest in which anything can 
happen, and probably will.
All preliminary matches, up to 
the semi-finals will consist of two 
games out of three. The semi-finals 
and finals will be three out of five. 
The games will be played in the 
gym on school tables. A dozen new 
paddles and a good supply of balls 
have just been purchased by the 
school for use in the tournament. 
There will be no teams represent
ing organizations and no doubles 
teams. The tournament will be all 
singles, and anyone who wishes to 
enter may do so.

Sacco, Yvonne Dreux, and Bette Yahr look on.

6TH1, CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 4, 1944STtve dTaructjie plaid
Fate of Golf Tournament 
Left to Students
After a rather mild winter, it be
gins to seem that spring is close at 
hand. The coming of spring signi
fies many things, the most popular 
being in the spring a young mans 
fancy lightly turns to love, but if 
ever a man has played golf, and he 
breathes the fresh air of spring, his 
fancy heavily and wholeheartedly, 
body and soul turns to golf, when 
he can once again be termed a 
divot digger.
This years tournament is sched
uled for June 18. Prizes are set for 
kickers handicap and low medal 
scores.
However, due to the terrific pace 
that has been set by this war and 
the small registration at school this 
semester, there is some doubt 
whether or not the tournament will 
be played. Those interested should 
write to Evening Student Council, 
Box 353, C. I. T.
Things to Think About
(This is the tenth in a series of ar.tjolps 
discussing the decline of registration in 
the evening school).
The end of the evening term is 
fast approaching and when the term 
does end the curtain will drop on 
a year which has seen one of the 
smallest enrollments in the history 
of Carnegie. As has been pointed 
out, there are several factors which 
have made this so. Because we have 
experienced such a condition, this 
should not be taken as the end; rath
er it should serve as a stimulus and 
we who are still plugging along 
should take up the cause and see 
what can be done in the direction 
of rebuilding the evening student 
rolls.
The demand for skilled and train
ed employees is critical and where 
can one become better trained than 
at Carnegie Tech? It can be said, 
and rightfully, that conditions and 
situations exist which tend to divert 
students from the campus. These 
conditions are not unsurmountable. 
Where , there is a will there is a 
way is a true axiom and will serve 
well during the present emergency. 
Many of our students have entered 
the armed forces of the country and 
many more will be called, but even 
so, there are quite a number still 
around who would be benefited by 
attending evening classes to supple
ment their daily work. Many times 
only a suggestion or two is need
ed to start a person towards Carne
gies campus.
There is an end to all things and 
the war will have its end too. Think 
what this is going to mean to all of 
us? While war is a terrible task
master, this same taskmaster gives 
us and the world many improve
ments, new devices, and new inven
tions which can be profitably em
ployed in peacetime pursuits. The 
competition is going to be severe 
and only those who have been provi
dent and farsighted enough to pre
pare now will be in a position to 
meet this keen competition when it 
comes.
It does not seem too much, does 
it, to propose to each evening stu
dent who reads this message that he 
or she undertake to sell the evening
^JUe C-dlitoA, dUti
The twenty-ninth annual banquet 
of the College of Engineering is now 
just a pleasant memory of a crowd
ed, tobacco smoke filled room and 
a group of young men joined to
gether for the purpose of having a 
good time, for most of us; but to the 
officers it is more than that, for they 
see now that something must be 
done about the perplexing problems 
this war is bringing on.
Never have I heard that this an
nual affair was not a success; yet the 
next years engineering officers will 
find an unorthodox situation con
fronting them when banquet time 
rolls around again.
I recall an article written in the 
Plaid several years ago. It went like 
this: Although it was a night school 
function, sponsored by the College 
of Engineering, only half of those 
who attended were engineers. Of
the remaining half, one fourth were 
from Arts and Industries, and the 
remainder were total outsiders. Per
haps next year it will be necessary 
to confine it to just the men attend
ing Carnegie now, or limit the tick
et sales. Any attempt to solve the 
problem in this manner is sure to 
cause a great deal of criticism, but 
something must be done to insure 
the success of future banquets.
How foolish this seems now, for 
no doubt the success of the last two 
banquets can be accounted to out
siders, and certainly the success of 
all the banquets for the duration 
will depend on them also. So let us 
put it down in our little note books 
that all banquets by the Evening 
College of Engineering from now 
until Eternity should remain open 
to outsiders.
This I believe is in all fairness to 
all parties concerned since the out. siders, mostly alumni, have shown 
great interest in this affair which 
was kindled during their under
graduate days at Carnegie Tech.

Farewell Party
 Last Tuesday a group of Tech stu
dents gathered after class in the Sil
ver Grill at the Hotel Henry to bid 
farewell to George Riffle and Glenn 
Mikaloff, an Art student and metal
lurgist respectively, who left Techs 
gay round of socials for the highly 
delightful social programs offered 
by the Armed Services. As a fitting 
gesture one of the fair ladies pres
ent even condescened to dance with 
Glenn, and he enjoyed it. Of 
course, no one recalled Glenn hav
ing ever danced before, and it isnt 
certain that any noticed whether or 
not he danced well this time. Pres
ent in the group was Mike Orenhoski who apparently is still worrying 
about his wifes reaction to the late 
hour of his entrance. But all had a 
most enjoyable time, and it can be 
said that George and Qlenn really 
left the Campus with regrets but 
with pleasant memories of a fra
ternal send-off.
