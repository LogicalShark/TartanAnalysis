If You Have
Scotch and Sochi 
Will Hold Tryouts 
Tonight In Gym
Tryouts for the chorus and spe
cialty acts of One on the I-IouSe, 
this years Scotch and Soda show, 
will be held tonight in the 
Womans Gym. From 7 to 8 
oclock the audition will be de
voted to specialty acts, and after 
8 oclock the chorus tryouts will 
be held.
The committee has announced 
that all sorts of specialty acts are 
desired. They can either be 
worked into the skits or present
ed separately. Single numbers 
comedy, music, or dancingand 
group numbers are acceptable. In 
other words, dust off your pet 
act, whatever it is, and bring it 
up to the Womans Gym tonight 
at 7:00.
Shirley Brown, 40, Scotch and 
Soda dance director, and her as
sistant, Roland Kraus, 42, plan 
to feature chorus numbers this i 
year. If there is to be a lead in 
One on the House, they say it 
will be the chorus, since the lat
ter y/ill be featured in the skits 
besides having its own numbers. 
And Shirley adds, . You dont 
need training or experience. If 
you have two feet, come out for 
chorus.
This years show will be dif
ferent from, the previous ones in, 
that the acts will be shorter and 
more numerous. Thus more peo
ple will have n chance to partici
pate in the show, and the revue 
will have more variety.

Of Itace Inferiority
New Math Club 
Is On Its Feet"AIEE Meets 
Tonight at 8:00ONE OF THE GIRLS
Mr. Louis Sacks presentation 
of Projective Analytic Geometry 
last Friday gave the newly formed 
Mathematics Club a fine start. His 
discussion was based mainly upon 
Desargues triangle theorem.
Plans were made for the club 
monogram, and suggestions for 
new problems were also discussed 
at the meeting. The next meeting 
is to be held March 15 at which 
time Walter Stuermann 41 will 
present a paper on Transient 
Phenomena in Electrical Circuits.
John Stuart Mill wrote:
Of all the vulgar modes of escaping from the consideration 
of the effect of social and moral influences on the human mind.
. the most vulgar is that of attributing the diversities of conduct 
and character to inherent natural differences.
The belief that there are inherent or biological dif
ference between nations is more than vulgar at the present 
timeit is dangerous and often vicious. We laugh at German 
nonsense about race supremacy and differences, yet we our
selves liaye not escaped similar rantings, which attempt to 
show that certain groups are different from other groups in 
nature, therefore incompatible, therefore natural enemies. The 
last 'World War was accompanied by many pseudo-scientific 
rationalizations for conflict between nations. The same type 
of irrationality is beginning to mar our thinking today.
The following quotations are illustrative:
(Editorial, New York Herald Tribune, 12/20/39) . . . some 
emotional quality in the German nature makes it especially 
susceptible to the impulses that lead to self-destruction.
(Harold Denny, New York Times, 10/8/39) . . . The 
Russian peoples are as contradictory and hard to understand as 
their system and its results . . . Their minds simply do not work 
as ours do.
(Charles A. Lindbergh, Readers Digest, November, 1939)
. . . Oriental guns are turning westward, Asia presses towards 
us on the Russian border, all foreign races stir restlessly. It is 
time to turn from our quarrels and to build our White ramparts 
again.
(New York Times, Letter, 11/19/39) ... To solve the 
question of German aggression, the Germans themselves need to 
be reformed, biologically, to mitigate their propensity for stupid 
violence.
(Editorial, New York Daily News, 10/19/39) . . . This war 
may yet resolve into a fight to a finish between European indi
vidualist civilization and Asiatic horde civilization.
Do these differ in any marked degree from German race
propaganda?
The attitude ol: scientists is recorded in the following reso
lution adopted by the American Anthropological Association at 
its annual convention last December:
Race involves the inheritance of similar physical variations 
by large groups of mankind, but its psychological and cultural' 
connotations, if they ex\st, have not been ascertained by science 
. . . Anthropology provides no scientific basis for discrimination 
against any people on the ground of racial inferiority, religious 
affiliation, or linguistic heritage.

It will be Jhe purpose of this 
column to present news of the 
various scholastic and professional 
honornries on campus and to ex
plain the alms of each of these 
.societies, This article, first of a 
series, deals with the honoraries 
in general.
According to. the freshman 
handbook, election to an honor
ary or professional fraternity 
moans public recognition of ex
ceptionally fine work In the field 
from which the honorary chooses 
its members." No matter whore 
where his Interests lie, the Car
negie student has an opportunity 
to secure such recognition, be
cause the honoraries here select 
their members on the basis oJ! 
either or both outstanding scholas
tic work and meritorious service 
in activities.
However, desirable as election 
to an honorary might be, many 
students seem to have no inter
est in the possibility. This atti
tude results partly from a lack 
of knowledge about the honoraries 
which in turn is due to a certain 
amount of inactivity on the part 
of these groups. As a matter of 
fact, the honoraries have cer
tain common objectives including 
the development of scholarship, 
culture, character, and creative 
initiative, all of which necessitate 
a program that should not only 
stimulate a students desire to join
but should increase the value of 
the honoraries both to their mem- j 
berships and to the school.
In order to create an interest in s 
the activities of the honoraries at I 
Carnegie, in order, to bring them 
into closer relationship with each 
other and to further their objec
tives, an Interhonorary Frater
nity Council has been found. This 
column was started as one means 
of accomplishing these ends.

By Betty Parker
Following the voting among the 
girls of 1 ho freshman classes in 
both Fine Arts and Moggie Murph 
last week, the plebes decided upon 
their class representatives to the 
YV, A. A. board. They are Keg 
Carver from Margaret Morrison 
and Dorothy Ellon from the Arts 
school. These new members at
tended the dinner meeting last 
night, and are of the governing 
group now.
Now, with such added enthu
siasm to that already pent up 
among us, we turn to more 
thoughts about our cabin. We see 
other' uses for the structure than 
were originally in view. With 
spring days just around the corner 
and the sun peeking out, there is 
a general itch to get out of doorsand into the woods. Owners of 
our favorite property are being 
contacted and work is being done
on it all of the time. We are 
really surprised lo find so very 
much work that has to be done to 
the cabin before the bricks can 
be laid.
Those girls among us who have 
gone out for the ancient art of 
fencing have proven their worth 
as female dArtagnans in their 
first exhibition at the Tech gym. 
On Thursday night the girls will 
travel with the rest of the fenc
ing classes down to the Pittsburgh 
Athletic Association to participate 
in a fencing demonstration at the 
club. This is the first time that 
the girls, who will present a mass 
precision drill, will have fenced 
away from home. The girls have 
been working on foil and this 
semester will takeup the more 
rigorous art of the sabre and the 
epee, both of which are heavier 
and more complicated than foil 
competition.
Tech Plebes End Semon 
With 51-50 Win Over W. Va.
Completing their final game of 
the season, the Plebe Basketballers took the West Virginians by 
the close score of 51-50. The 
score at the half was 21-20. W. 
Patton and H. Smith were high 
scorers for Tech while Rawlins of 
West Virginia was high scorer of 
the game with 25 points.
Going into the last thirty sec
onds of play, Kaiser, who has been 
the Captain and mainstay of the 
Plebes all year sank a long looping shot to win the game. The 
season was very successful. Tech

Basketeers Tackle 
Temple Quintet;
Then Westminster
In a wild high-scoring game 
Saturday night, West Virginia reg
istered a 66-57 triumph over the; 
Carnegie Tech Tartans. In scor
ing their second win over Tech 
this year, the Mountaineers had 
to use two substitutes who pro
vided the winning spaiic, Brooks 
and McCartney scored 23 points 
and their reckless playing inspir
ed the Mountain boys. Techs 
sparkplug was again Captain Rube 
Stark who scored 22 points for 
, high scoring honors.
The game opened with Tech 
running up a lead of 24-15. Brooks 
and McCartney were sent into the 
game, and at' the half the score 
stood at 30-29, Tech leading. 
Blazing away at a rate of four 
points a minute, the two teams 
poured in basket after basket. 
When all the shooting and smoke 
cleared away, the Mountaineers 
had won.
Tech plays but three more 
games this season, their oppo
nents being Temple at home, and 
Westminster and Penn State away. 
The game Saturday night was 
Techs 11th defeat in sixteen 
starts, but the record is not a 
very good measure of the team. 
Victories over Pitt and Geneva 
prove the ' potential greatness of 
the team.
Fencers Hold 
Demonstration 
Thursday Nite
Carnegies fencing forces have 
received an invitation from the 
Pittsburgh Athletic Association to 
give a demonstration and exhibi
tion at their gym on Thursday 
night the 7th.
The team will give an exhibition 
similar to the one presented here 
at the Tech gym. The fencers, 
however, will be without the serv
ices of the dramat members who 
will be engaged in preparation for 
their forthcoming show.
Captain Monacchio, who coaches 
the Tartan squad, is likewise in 
charge of the Pittsburgh A. A. 
team, which for the past nine 
years, has held the Western Penn
sylvania and the Tri-State fenc
ing championship.
Carnegie Swimmers 
Dunk Ohio Wesleyan
Plaid Mermen Close Season Witli 
Home Contest Against Grove City
Success, on the Tartan swim
mers third road trip, was achieved 
by the slim margin of one point. 
The victory was gained at the ex
pense of the mermen of Ohio 
Wesleyan University; the final 
score, being 38 to 37.
To a great extent the diving 
events spelled the outcome of the 
meet, for the coaches had agreed 
before the contest to stage the 
diving just for exhibition. It had 
also been decided that Carnegie 
would be given 6 points, and the 
Wesleyans would receive 3 points 
in this all important event.
The Slcibo nators took five 
points in a hurry by romping 
home the winner in the initial 300 
yard medley, their time being 
3:08.5. The following contest was 
won by the Ohioians in which
Flickinger beat out Harold 
Hirsch in the grueling time of 
2:28.6. The opposition continued 
in their meet winning style by 
annexing the succeeding events 
the 50 and 100 yard sprint 
events. Bill Molvie, of the home 
squad, took first position in the 
150 yard back strike, and Young 
Willis Anthony was declared the 
winner in the 200 yard breast 
stroke. The final individual event 
on the card was the 440 yard 
distance event, Tech placing first 
in this race assured the Slcibo 
mermen of a win.
The final swimming meet of the 
year is to be held tomorrow in the 
Carnegie pool at 4:30 oclock. The 
opponents in this last water bat
tle are to be the swimmers of 
Grove City College.

Swimming Entries Must Be In Soon; 
Tau Delts Take Honors in Two Events
By George Tondorf
Entries are due for Intramural 
swimming on March 9. The only 
requirements are that all par
ticipants must attend 10 practice 
periods and must pass a physical 
examination. Competition begins 
on April 1, and it seems that last 
years champs, the DUs, are go
ing to be the team to beat, with 
the Kappa Sigs looming as dark 
horses.
Tau Delts Take Table Tennis
Tau Delta Phis paddle wielders 
knocked off the men of KapiDa 
Sigma by a 4-1 count to take the 
Fraternity League table tennis 
Crown. Saul Moses, Sid Gebelow.. 
and Iz Lurie downed the Kappa Sig 
trio of Rube Stark and Joe and Bud 
Wilson to clinch the issue. The 
Tau Delts now must meet the Citcom Clan in the playoffs, and the 
fraternity men should have their 
hands full with the Commuters 
Who rolled over Scobell Halls 
squad, 5-0.
The Tau Delts walked off with 
another title by winning the foul 
shooting contest by one point over 
the- second place ATO and PiKA 
teams. The victors split the cords 
in 40 out of 75 tries, while the 
runners-up dropped in 39 in as 
many attempts. The winning 
combination was composed of 
Nelkin, Moses, and Chotiner.
Individual Contest Postponed
The individual foul shooting
competition has been postponed 
to Wednesday evening, March 6. 
Entries should see the bulletin 
board in the gym for time and 
basket. In order to qualify, 15 
out of 25 shots must be dropped 
through the cords. Those qual
ifying will enter the final round, 
in which each man will take 50 
shots at the hoop.
Paced by Miller and May, the 
SAEs downed the Delts. on the 
hardwood courts, 35-16. The win
ners led all the way, enjoying a 
22-12 advantage at half-time. Bill 
Miller, SAE guard, topped the 
scoring with nine markers.
Sparked by the return to form 
of Hal Turner and Tom Brad
ley, Kappa Sigma registered an 
18-14 victory over the Phi Kaps.
Intramural 
Bowling Is 
Under Way
Theta Xi, Betas 
Triumph in Early 
Duckpin Matches
Bowling started of with a bang 
last week, 14 matches being play
ed at the New Strand Alleys. 
Theta Xi showed great form in 
downing the Citcom Clan in three 
straight games. The winners, pac
ed by Vern Schilawske, rolled 
over the 560 mark in all three 
contests.
Beta Theta Pi went over the 
600 line, rolling a 618 in the first 
game, and swept their match with 
the SAEs. Warner Ely turned in 
a nice job for the Squirrel Hill
ers.
The Kappa Sigs gained a forfeit 
over the ATOs, but the men from 
Clyde Street scored over 600 in 
three practice trials, which should 
make them bear plenty of watch
ing.
Other results were: PiKAs, 3, 
Phi Kaps. 0; Beta Sigs, 2, DUs, 1; 
Delts, 2, Tau Delts, 1; DUs, 2, Kap
pa Sigs, 1; TX, 2, Betas, 1; Citcom,

A 2-minute test for telephone users
OPPONENTS
By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor
Carnegie Techs swimming team continued their winning 
ways against Ohio Wesleyan in their puddle last Saturday after
noon. From what we hear the pool was so small that the boys 
almost met themselves going np and down the pool.
In fact some of the swimmers claim to this day that they 
must have been swimming across the tank instead of lengthwise. 
Added to the confusion was the diving board being placed under 
an angle iron in one corner of the pool so conveniently that by 
standing on the board the ceiling could be touched. .Needless to 
say the diving was for exhibition purposes only.
As the Tartans were the visitors they were given six points 
for diving while Wesleyan took only three. These gratis points 
came in mighty handy as our boys won by only one point.
Harold Hirsch was the fair-haired boy of the day. He came 
back to take the final event of the meet, the 440-yard free style 
race, after losing to the same opponent in the 220.
For Wesleyan dash man Dale was the big gun. He took the 
50- and 100-yard free style events, tieing the pool record in the 
former race.
In the meet with Grove City here tomorrow the Tartan 300- 
yard medley relay team and the 400-yard relay team will try to 
break the school records. Our guess is that at least one of these 
records will be erased from the books.
Coach Allen E. Risedorph rates this years team on a par 
with that team of a few years ago which included Ranny Boyer, 
the best backstroker ever to swim for Tech.
Notes From Our Scrapbook
Sunday evening the basketball players were given a big 
feed by Coach Max Hannum and Walter Burns at the latters 
home. Need we say the boys had to be rolled away from the 
table . . . In the past year approximately 650 boys took part, 
in athletics at Carnegie. Quite a surprising figure . . .
In passing-why not have an open handball tournament in
cluding both the faculty and the students? If one is held, no 
doubt the faculty would do all right for themselves, for we hear 
some of them are mighty sharp on a handball court . . .
During the course of the Tech-Duquesne game Captain Bob 
Stark asked who was guarding Bill Lacey. Red Randall Burch 
came back with the remark: Thats my man but its so dark 
in liore I cant see him. Small wonder we call him anythingfor-a-laugh Buroh . . .
That loud noise you hear eminating from the Tech bench 
during basketball games is Frank LePage whispering encourage
ment to tho playors . . .

In Old Sorority
Why not renew the honorary 
sorority again? Why should the 
men get all the breaks?
Along with a number of girls, 
we have talked with several stu
dents who would like to see it 
brought back into existence, and 
know of several girls who would 
like to join.
There are several qualifications 
which one must have to get into 
an honorary sorority, but if the 
candidate has these qualifications 
why not go ahead and elect of
ficers and renew the sorority
A sorority for the evening di
vision of girl students is just the 
ticket for all students to get ac
quainted with each other, because 
aside from that you do not get a 
chance to meet everyone on the 
campus grounds.
The fact that the former presi
dent of the sorority, Ethel Rogner, 
left to undertake studies at the 
University of Pittsburgh, is no 
reason why it cant be continued.
Evening Student Council 
awards a beautiful insignia key 
to students who help with the 
decorations, show-cards, check
room, and cleaning-up at the 
various social affairs.
Engineers will have only one 
more chance to earn points after 
their dance next Saturday at 
Thistle Hall. Three periods in 
connection with Saturdays dance 
the afternoon of March 9, the 
,evening of the dance, and Sun
day afternoon, March 10will 
give students a chance to work 
for points.
Students can have a lot of fun 
working at these affairs, and earn 
points toward receiving an in
signia at the annual Joanquet. The 
committee urges all Engineering 
students to come out to Thistle 
Hall this week end and j,oin in 
the fun 'and point-work.
Points are given to students 
who do the work, but at least two 
points must be obtained by every 
student for work at an affair 
sponsored by his particular 
school.
Engineers Social 
Committee Meets
One of the most important 
meetings of the year for the En
gineers Social Committee will be 
held in the Carnegie Union, 
Forbes at Beeler Street, on Fri
day, March the eighth, at tenthirty.
Final details of the dance will 
be planned, and further develop
ments of the Banquet have to be 
discussed at this meeting, so that 
it is necessary that all members 
who can possibly attend plan to 
do so.
New Swing Style 
Of Clyde Knights 
Enjoyed By Many
Better late than never said Car
negie Evening students as they 
flocked to Thistle Hall last Sat
urday, March 2nd to celebrate 
Washingtons Birthday. The af
fair, an annual Student Council 
dance,, was held at that late date, 
 because February 22nd is no 
l longer an official holiday at Car
negie Tech.
Clyde Knights orchestra sup
plied a well-balanced fare of 
dance tunes which proved very 
popular with the large- crowd 
which attended. Advocates of 
both sweet and swing music were 
well pleased. Washington surely 
must have turned over in his grave 
when the citizens of the country 
which he helped to found started 
cavorting about the floor to the 
jitterbug music.
Full advantage was taken of the 
patriotic decoration possibilities 
which this holiday dance pre
sents. Thistle Hall was colorful
ly decorated with red, white, and 
blue, and many decorative novel
ties were distributed abo^it the 
room.
As usual lovely corsages were 
given out to the first two hundred 
ladies to arrive. Both the cor
sages and the programs were in 
keeping with the patriotic spirit 
of the affair.
For the past sixteen years this 
has been one of the most popular 
affairs on the campus. It has 
continued to grow in popularity 
each year, and last Saturdays af
fair was no exception.
Frank Young, Social Chairman, 
and his assistant Joe Gummo were 
in charge of the affair.
LOU It. FOSNER
Arts School 
Picks Fosner
Chosen Officer 
At Election Parly
Financial affairs of the Evening 
College of Fine Arts rest in the 
hands of the capable and vibrant 
young architect, Lou R. Fosner. 
Chosen treasurer at the fall elec
tion of the school, Lou is serving 
his first year in the Council, al
though he has been active on the 
campus ever since he entered Car
negie Tech.
Lou received his earlier educa
tion in Schenley High School. 
Here he indulged in several sports, 
foremost being baseball and foot
ball. His football career was cut 
short by injuries received during 
a game, but he continued in base
ball through his four years. That 
he lias talent was shown by the 
fact that scouts for the Interna
tional League picked him up 
when he finished school and he 
played at first base for some 
time.
He decided, however, that he 
was too short and too light in 
weight to reach the pinnacle he 
desired in that sport. He values 
the friends he made while play-v 
ing and feels that the broadening 
influence of his ball-playing ex
perience has been a part of his 
education. He is one of the few 
students in Carnegie Tech who 
has played league baseball.
Lou then recalled his earlier 
ambition toward architecture and 
entered Carnegies Art School four 
years ago. Since that time he 
professes that architecture, is not 
only intended as his profession 
but his hobby as well. He has 
worked on the design of some pri
vate residences and plans to do 
housing project design at some fu
ture time.
Liking everything modern, Lou 
is partial to smooth, lively music 
and does not want jitterbug style 
associated with his name at all, 
saying that thats old and out. 
Nu Sigma Alpha is his fraternity 
and his One-and-Only is studying 
at Pitt. He is so enthusiastic 
about Arts Dance on March 16 
that he would rather discuss it 
than answer questions about him
self.
Incidentally he hopes to get his 
Certificate in June, 1941.

Evening College of Fine Arts 
will hold their second dance - of 
the year on Saturday evening, 
March 16 th.
Officers of the college have se
cured the permission of the school 
officials to hold the dance in the 
gymnasium. Students are always 
glad to attend dances in the gym 
because of the added space which 
is available.
In an endeavor to provide the 
campus with something definitely 
new in the way of a band, the 
officers have been canvassing the 
district for the past three or four 
weeks. Although they refuse to 
announce the name of the band 
at the present time, thejr definite
ly promise a band of superior 
style whose music will be pleas
ing to all the students.
Art students always have a flare 
where decorations are concerned, 
and they promise that these will 
be in complete harmony with the ! 
seasons atmosphere.
Arts officers and their com-1 
mitteehave betfn working hard i 
on the plans for this dance, and I 
feel .sure that they have some- [ 
thing truly differ,eni; to present to 
the students.
Admission will.be free for alii 
the students in Fine Arts, but; all 
other students will be charged 
one dollar.
Remember Otto Anderson got 
his start in life baking and sell
