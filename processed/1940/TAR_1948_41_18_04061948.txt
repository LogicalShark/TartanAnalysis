Education Conference 
Will Open April 12
Improvement Of Professional 
Education Called Chief Objective
Believing that professional education is not able to keep pace 
with advancing knowledge in this fast-moving world, 125 top-notch 
educators will exchange ideas in the teaching professions at the 
first Inter-Professions Conference on Education for Professional 
Responsibility to be held at Buck Hill Falls, Pa., on April 12 to 14.
Sponsored by the Carnegie corporation, the Interprofessions con
ference was initiated by Provost E. D. Smith when he described the
need for the conference in let-*-----------------------------------------------
ters to other educators in profes
sional fields. The idea was met 
with enthusiasm.
Problems Brought to Light
Professor Smith found at a few 
preliminary meetings that the dis
cussion brought to light the 
wide range of common problems 
of education for the several pro
fessions and revealed a great op
portunity for mutual assistance 
through the sharing of different 
experiences of the several pro
fessions in dealing with these 
common problems.
According to Professor Smith, 
who was named chairman of the 
planning committee last year, the 
conference will consider four 
main pointshow to train the professional man to deal with a 
specific problem in his field; how 
to train him to see a specific prob
lem in relation to its social, legal 
and other implications; how to 
make him a good citizen; and how 
to train him to be prepared for 
professional or social change. 
Three Sessions to be Held
The conference will hold three sessions. The first will study the 
aims of professional education 
and will be headed by Dean Don
ald K. David of the Harvard Bus
iness school. The second, to discuss 
methods of professional instruc
tion, will be led by Karl T. Comp
ton, president of Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. The third, 
headed by Judge Vanderbilt, will 
discuss social and humanistic in
struction.
Professor Smith declared that 
our education is bogging down. 
The world is changing so fast that 
the professions have to change 
too. Every day the problems 
change and the problems are in
creasing faster than our knowl
edge. Professional education has

Techsperts 
Ask Students 
For Stumpers
The Techsperts of the Carnegie 
Technical are conducting a cam
paign calculated to arouse the stu
dent body to stump the experts 
on scientific and engineering prob
lems who regularly exhibit their 
abilities in the Technical.
Any undergraduate or graduate 
student or faculty member may 
submit questions. For questions 
that are accepted the author will 
receive three dollars, and a five 
dollar prize will be awarded in 
the event that the experts are 
stumped.
Don Koenig, Techspert editor of 
the Technical has pointed out that 
the braintrusters will not be al 
lowed to use textbooks or other 
aids in answering the questions 
and that only questions which re
late to engineering, physics, 
mathematics, or chemistry will be 
accepted.
Members of the Techsperts are: 
Richard Drisko, George Royer, 
and James Woodford, electricals; 
John Nash, mathematics; Hans 
Weinberger and Carl Klahr, phys
ics; Vernon Neubert and Howard 
Recht, chemistry; Walter Kawa, 
chemical; Paul Ohrman, metal
lurgy; and Jorge Dellepiane, me
chanical. All are seniors except 
Drisko, who is a junior.

Constitution 
Being Revised
Student Councils constitution is 
currently under the scrutiny of a 
committee of five Council membec? who will prepare recommendations to be submitted to 
Council for approval.
1ACs Bill Johns, committee 
chairman, pointed out that no 
changes have been made in the 
by-laws since 1943, nor in the 
constitution itself since 1945. 
Consideration must be given to 
revision^ at least every two years
There is no provision for pref
erential voting in the present 
constitution, nor is there a provision for any organization to as
sist Student Council in conducting 
elections. Johns stated that the 
committee will probably recom
mend that Alpha Phi Omega, na
tional service fraternity, be of
ficially designated as the group 
in charge of handling future elec
tions.
Scottie Scoops Tartan On Court, 
Will Publish Winners In April Issue
With an impish swag of its plaid tail, the Scottie has gripped 
the names of the seven members of Spring Carnival firmly between 
its shiny teeth and has bounded off with them in the direction of 
April 29, publication day for the April issue of the humor magazine.
In short, the Tartan has been scooped.
The Scotties prize was put together during the all-school Court 
election of April 2, which, under the direction of APO, attracted 
in excess of 900 votes. ?------------------------------------------------
These votes were counted in 
secret, and the results are now 
known to only four men.
Chief among the men to be 
haunted in queenly fashion dur
ing the coming month is Wilton 
(Winsome Will) Hawkins, chair
man of the Spring Carnival com
mittee.Said Hawkins of his predica
ment: I have decided to abandon 
mechanical engineering for the 
coming month so that I may de
vote all of my time to Spring 
Carnival and to beating off female 
espionage.
I expect to be in there pitch
ing every minute and may even win.
Richard Dunbar, Scottie magazine layout editor, and second
keeper of the secret, was una
vailable for comment for obvious 
reasons.
And the names of the APO bal
lot counters have not been divulged in order to allay a definite 
menace to the Boy Scout laws 
which deal with these topics.
In addition to portraits of each 
of the seven members of the Court 
and the information which is gen
erally considered pertinent to this 
type of display, the official Spring 
Carnival schedule and a map of 
the campus and vicinity locating 
all of the events and showing how 
to reach them will be included.

Revisions Of Points System 
Tabled For Further Studies
My personal opinion is that the books ought to be taken 
away from the Comptroller and put in the hands of the Stu
dent Council treasurer, said Negley Reed during a fiery de
bate at the Student Council meeting of March 31 in Indus
tries Hall.
His statement came during a discussion introduced by 
Marvin Gustavson concerning the financial records of student 
organizations.
The suggested revisions in the mens points system, com
piled by Delta Skull and submit-Gustavson Asks 
Investigation 
Of Finances
Winsome Will Hawkins, Spring 
Carnival committee chairman and 
chief objective for the remainder 
of this month of feminine at
tempts to learn the identity of the 
April 29 Carnival Court election 
winners.
Calling for a comprehensive 
and understandable report on the 
present status of the finances of 
each activity and of the overall 
group, Councilman Marvin Gus
tavson has been appointed by 
President Ulrich as chairman of 
a committee to make the investi
gations needed to establish the 
foundations for such a statement.
Gustavsons motion, which led 
to the appointment of this com
mittee, was made at the March 
31 meeting of Student Council. 
Budget Chairman Paul Schucker 
has also been appointed a mem
ber of this committee.
Call A Halt
'There must be a halt called 
to everything and everyone must 
find out where they stand today 
said Gustavson after the meet
ing.
Then we must work out a plan 
to keep them [the activities] from 
getting jumbled up from now on. 
He explained that now is the 
best time for such action in view 
of the terrific expansion of 
campus activities.
There are more people involv 
ed and there is more time and 
more money expended than ever 
before. And yet we are still op
erating with the difficulties in 
management created by the war! 
Full Report Wanted 
The final objectives of Gus
tavsons committee were defined 
as the development of the full 
financial report and the formu
lation of a plan to eliminate fric
tion in the future between activ
ities and the administration by 
making both fully cognizant of 
the up-to-the-minute financial 
situation of all activities.
He pointed out that, lacking 
this financial knowledge, organ
izations cannot govern themselves, 
being -inable to obtain definite 
figures on past or future earn
ings.
Books for many activities are 
either non-existant or in very 
poor shape, and many funds are 
being wasted because of the 
obscurity and the impossibility of 
knowing and dealing with them.
ted by Bennard Perlman, aroused 
a protracted discussion, but the 
motion to accept them was first 
passed, then rescinded, and final
ly tabled to allow Council mem
bers to familiarize themselves 
with the details of the proposed 
system.
Gustavsons Motion
Gustavsons motion on the ac
tivities financial status, which 
ultimately carried, embodied a 
plan for a committee to study 
and recommend a suitable means 
for more positive control and 
knowledge of incomes and ex
penditures by , the individual ac
tivities, to be appointed by Coun
cil president Ulrich.
Commenting later that records 
have been lost and most of 
those books Xot various -activities) 
are either non-existent or in very 
poor shape, Gustavson provoked 
statements from Reed, as well as 
Paul Shucker, chairman of the 
budget committee.
Publications Commended
Shucker claimed that publica' 
tions, at least, are keeping a pret
ty fair set of books. However, 
mentioning that some people in 
activities seem to think this mat
ter could bear investigation, Gus
tavson defended his motion for a 
separate investigating committee 
by stating, I dont think the bud
get chairman should try to recon
struct the crime. President Ul
rich promised that a committee 
would be appointed.
Delta Skulls suggested revision 
of the mens points system origi
nally contained an additional pro
vision that the men receiving the 
most points would automatically 
be elected to Scimitar and Delta 
Skull.
Denouncing this procedure, An
drew Sterrett, chairman of the 
Student Council points committee 
said, I am not convinced that the 
men with the most points who are 
eligible to an honorary should 
automatically be admitted.
On the basis of Sterretts chal
lenge, that provision was elimi
nated from the proposal and the 
revisions were accepted. Imme
diately, however, a number of 
questions were raised as to the 
details of the new points system. 
Allotments Questioned
Individual allotments of points 
were questioned by members of 
Council. Clarification of these 
questions was hampered and con
fused by the fact that most of the 
members were unfamiliar with 
the provisions for point allot
ments.
The final action, following pas
sage of Dale Wrights motion to 
rescind approval of the point? 
sysxem, was the tabling of the 
matter until a copy of the points 
system left in Dean Dickinson's

Editorial
Functions Of Council
What are functions of Student Council?
We suggest that they are two: legislative 
and investigative.
Part of Councils time should be and is be
ing spent in the making of new laws and 
in the revision of old ones. These rulings are 
then applied to a multitude of situations which 
come under the heading of weekly business.
This first activity has, unfortunately, been 
Councils only function in the past.
But our student government appears to 
have made the discovery that human be
havior is, at its best, inexact. The rules which 
govern it are therefore of necessity equally 
inexact. And between the two resulting mar
gins of fudge now pass everything from 
poorly awarded keys to organizations with no 
purpose.
Our national laws seem to recognize this 
broad back alley and thus the term reason
able appears frequently in legal terminology. 
People go to court to determine what is 
reasonable, and Congress is normally 
on its guard (especially during the sen
sitive years of pre-election) to discover just 
how far these same people are stretching this 
already too flexible word.
If the stretch is becoming a permanent de
formation, then the bugles blow and an in
vestigation begins.
Student Council has this year made its dis
covery of human elasticity from close obser
vation of problems such as those just mention
ed. It has begun to do something about clos
ing up the more glaring gaps which this an
noying human property has left by initiating 
several investigations. Some, such as the look 
into keys, are bogging down; others, such as 
Councilman Gustavsons search into the hand
ling of activities moneys may yet bear un
usual fruit.
We hope that these investigations will not 
be considered as mere individual publicity 
stunts, or as hopeless attempts to make use of 
an authority which is claimed by some to be 
virtually non-existent.
We hope instead that the members of Stu
dent Council will recognize that in this work 
lies one of their primary duties, and that the 
decisions which they make will be real only 
if reinforced with active, searching minds, duel
ing constantly with the squirming tail-end 
which is so important in maintaining orderly 
relationships among men, the margin of 
fudge.
Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
The fraternity system can and should be a 
healthy collegiate influence, but at CIT it has be
come something of a farce. The obvious faults in 
the system, I believe, can be traced in a large 
part to the inconsistencies of administration policy.
In the first place, the attitude toward fraterni
ties should be one of helpfulness rather than mere
ly of forbearance. This positive attitude has not 
obtained in the past.
The school owes it to each and every student, 
as part of his education, to provide him with the 
type of social environment and contacts that will 
be most useful to him in later life. Insufficient in 
scope as it may be, the fraternity system has in 
the past come as close as anything we have to of
fer at Carnegie Tech to achieve this goal. Yet, the 
administration has done very little to promote and 
expand this important facet of education.
The schools owning the majority of the fra
ternity houses and renting them on an individualoccupant basis does not constitute adequate sup
port, since the maintenance of these houses (theo
retically the schools obligation) is in practice quite 
a different problem. The fraternities have had a 
difficult time getting an equitable return from 
their rent paid to the school because of the red 
tape involved in getting things done and because 
of the personnel in charge of maintenance.
The second fundamental principle of good 
school-fraternity relationships is that there must 
be a firm guiding hand. In the past the Inter-fraternity council has proved itself incapable of hand
ling this job, in general being superbly ineffective. 
On the other hand, of the administration the activi
ties have been about as impressive as a cold fish 
handshake.
If the fraternities are to live by the rules set 
down for them by the school, the school must have 
some means of enforcing those rules. Judging by 
the record of the past five years, with which I am 
fairly familiar, I would say that the majority of 
the administrations threats have been just so much 
hot air. "Long ago the fraternity question was 
changed from What may we do? to What can 
we get away with?
There has been little active punishment for out 
and out rule violations. Every rule in the book 
from chaperonage and women in the houses after 
hours, to pocket-pinning and lead-piping of 
rusheeshas been broken from time to time. I 
dont think that decampusing is the answer for 
every infraction.
Neither do I believe that the fraternities can no 
longer serve a useful purpose. They are still the 
most constructive type of organization that a man 
can join. However, the school should either tighten 
up on privileges when rules are broken or change 
the rules and let IF decide where the chips are to 
fall.
l. e.Liberal Voices Are 
Being Endangered
By Gerald C. Meyers---------------
The liberal voice in American politics is dying.
The lonely but zealous flame which has so long 
been the symbol of hope for the underprivileged 
has dwindled to an ember. We are not all to blame 
but surely we will all suffer.
Today all liberals and/or progressives are being 
branded Communists. Any opposing faction, wheth
er gainfully motivated or not, is greeted with open 
arms. Granted, Communism, or rather a disembowled semblance of same, now offers a threat to 
capitalist America. It is ridiculous, however, to 
suppose that all sincere attempts to assist fellow 
human being are Kremlin inspired.
Let us not deceive ourselves. If we fail to 
classify honest effort into other than these two cate
gories our hopes of retaining (or obtaining) dem
ocracy will decay in the venomous secretion of 
ultimate stagnation.
In the past, social legislation has proven its 
worth. But are such movements to terminate here? 
What about anti-poll tax, anti-lynch, and antiJim Crow laws? Is one-half of vital industry to 
continue thwarting free-enterprise with powerful 
oligarchy? Are Thomas committees to keep pop
ping up, only to disgrace themselves and humiliate 
sincere citizens?
To a large extent it is we, the potential'bene
ficiaries, that have murdered the progressive move
ment. Our willingness to go along with the proli
fic Red-labeling and name-calling has produced 
little but confusion. Before it is too late the liberal 
cause must be reincarnated if we are inhibit the 
inroads of decadence and maintain democracy.
Question of Policy
On Stage
By Dick Drisko and Edward Von Halle
Last Friday night the curtain 
went up on the drama schools 
production, The Taming of the 
Shrew, revealing to its audi
ence a combination of unsurpass
ed writing, masterful directing, 
and competent acting. It was the 
best play we have ever seen at 
Carnegie Tech.
As an uproarious comedy and 
one of Shakespeares most pop
ular plays, The Taming of the 
Shrew is a welcome relief from 
the siege of awkward and atavistic 
experiments the Carnegie Tech 
audiences suffered through last 
semester.
Seeing one play that we can 
enjoy without making allowance 
for the inexperience of the play
wright or the last decades change 
of taste toward melodrama is cer
tainly pleasant. But then you prob
ably saw Coronados Children 
and Secret Service yourselves.
Having B. Iden Payne to direct 
the play was certainly fortunate, 
since Payne is a recognized 
Shakespearean authority. The pro
duction is evidence of his adroit
ness.
The Taming of the Shrew is 
a reworking by Shakespeare of 
an old Italian play, The Taming 
of a Shrew, of unknown author
ship. Payne added to the script in
cidents and episodes which were 
present in the older play; it is 
uncertain whether Shakespearean 
productions contained them or 
not. The insertion of the Epilogue 
and of Slys interruptions and 
stoppages of the play made it all 
the more enjoyable.
How much of the interpolation 
was Payne, how much historically 
documented, we could not learn, 
since Mr. Payne left for Texas 
before we could see him. But your
reviewers believe it was Mr. 
Payne who was primarily respon
sible for the imaginative depart-ure from the conventional ver
sion of The Taming of theShrew.
Peggy Lee and Bill Ryan have 
done an excellent job in assem
bling the costumes for the produc
tion. They drew upon the Pole 
collection for originals, and pat
terned many of the others after 
members of the collectionall of 
these are of unquestionable au
thenticity. The audience will long 
remember the sumptuous pure 
white of the marriage garb of 
Bainca and Lucentio.
The illusion of the play within 
a play was greatly augmented by 
the simple, unostentatious sets executed by Lloyd Weninger.
Frederick Miller and Louis Ed
monds gave particularly fine per
formances in their roles of Chris
topher Sly and Petrucia. Millers 
performance was so convincing 
and spontaneous that we found 
ourselves wondering if he were ad libbing.
The Petrucia of Edmonds, who 
made his character the most dom
inant in the play, was as near to 
mature, professional acting as we 
have seen on the Carnegie stage. 
The audience frequently showed 
its appreciation of his acting.
Sada Thompson was excellent 
as a coquettish player, flirting 
copiously with Sly and the Lord. 
Ruth Gubermans performance as 
Katherina the Shrew, though for 
the most part more Guberman 
than Katherina, was fine in the 
scene in which the Shrew, at last 
tamed, speaks the lines, But sun 
it is not, when you say it is not;

TUESDAY, APRIL 6, 1048THE CARNEGIE TARTAN8
Doherty Disapproves 
A ll-School Open House
Hospitalization And Medical Care 
Discussed At Conference Dinner
Calling pre-war all-school open houses unsuccessful in their ob
jective of showing pre-college students what Carnegie Tech was 
like, President Doherty expressed disapproval of any attempt to re
vive the tradition in a statement made during the March 31 Stu
dent Conference committee dinner.
The President explained that while thousands of local residents 
inspected the school during these annual exhibitions, the need for 
such visits was questionable. ?
He did, however, support the
idea of department-by-department 
open houses with the proviso that 
they be attended by specific in
vitation.
The entire structure of obtain
ing medical treatment, and the 
purpose and membership of the 
Conference committee occupied 
most of the remainder of the even
ings discussions.
When Joan Ollett, president of 
the Womens Dorm council, asked 
what provision is made for a 
doctor to visit a dorm girl if the 
girl is too sick to come to him, 
she opened general survey of the 
schools medical system.
Dean Dickinson explained that 
in case of a serious emergency, 
the Presbyterian hospital can be 
called, with the Housemothers 
consent, for an ambulance.
The Dean of Men was asked by 
President Doherty to review the 
situation with Dr. Miner after 
further discussion indicated a gen 
eral uncertainty as to the precise 
operation of the hospitalization 
setup. 
Reviewing once again the pur
pose of the Student Conference 
committee, the President empha
sized that it is not a general greivance committee, but rather a me
dium whereby all important mat
ters which are not being taken 
care of through regular channels 
can be discussed.
Scholarships
Applications for all scholar
ships for the summer and fall 
semesters are available in the 
Dean of Mens office. These ap
plications must be filled out and 
returned to the Deans office 
by April 15.
WSSF Begins 
Annual Drive 
For Funds
The World Student Service 
Fund, begun by college people in 
this country to help students 
abroad, started its annual cam
paign this week.
The purpose of WSSF is to pro
vide books, food, and medical care 
to university students in wardevastated countries.
Sponsored by the YW&YMCAs, 
the Newman club, and Bnai 
Brith, the student fund helps 
these foreign students who have 
shown their desire to learn in 
spite of the obstacles that they 
meet in the aftermath of war.
Co-chairmen for the drive on 
campus are Louise Gearhart and 
Dick Herman. Solicitations will be 
held in the dorms and at the 
WSSF booth which has been 
erected along the walk near Sklbo. 
Pamphlets and information on 
what already has been accom
plished by the organization will 
be available at this booth.
The appeal is being made di
rectly to students and teachers be
cause the fund was originally 
started by these groups during the 
Japanese invasion of China.
STUDY REFRESHED 
HAVE A COCA-COLA
Beaux Arts 
Considers 
Factor Needs
Possible discarding of the schol
arship requirement for member
ship in the Beaux Arts honorary 
was discussed last Monday at a 
meeting of that organization. The 
necessity of candidates having 
a 2.5 factor, one of the present 
qualifications of the honorary, 
was questioned.
Some members expressed the 
opinion that interest in the Arts 
ball and other functions of the 
group might be a better standard 
of admission than above-average 
marks.
Having recently sponsored one 
of the few Arts balls in the history of CIT which showed a profit, 
Beaux Arts members are now 
nominating new students for 
membership.
Although no action was taken 
to amend the constitution, and 
thus change the Beaux Arts hon
orary to a society, the point will 
be presented to Director John
stone and Dean Dickinson.
Part of the decision concerning 
Beaux Arts leaving the ranks of 
the honoraries depends upon the 
reactivation of Tau Sigma Delta, 
the architecture and P & D hon
orary. Beaux Arts is composed 
largely of painting and design 
students, and at present it is the only honorary for P & Ds. Other 
departments in the Art school have 
their own departmental honorar
ies.
New members of Beaux Arts 
will probably be tapped before 
Spring Carnival call day, so that 
work on various projects of the 
organization can begin. Although 
the Arts ball has been given bi
ennially since 1933, it is believed 
that new interest will reestablish 
the ball as an annual event.
Job Interview Rush 
Slows As Predicted
Seniors Realize That They Can
Interview Firms Specially Desired
The staff of the Bureau of Placements heaved a sigh of relief 
last week as the worst of the employment interview rush seemed to 
have passed, for the anxious gleam in the eyes of prospective grad
uates had disappeared, being replaced by just a hint of a twinkle.
Charles E. Wangeman, head of the Bureau, explained that since 
the seniors had become familiar with the actual trend of job ap
plications the June graduates were being much more selective in
----------------------------------------------?putting their names on interview
lists.
Tri Delts Give 
Scholarships
The Delta Delta Delta sorority 
is offering two scholarships this 
year to two women students in 
need of financial aid. A minimum 
factor of 2.75 and definite need are required. The application 
blanks which are now available 
in Dean Dickinsons office, must

Each scholarship consists of 50 
dollars from a fund set up by the local chapter and 100 dollars from 
the national treasury of the soror

necessarily go to members of the 
sorority. They are available to any 
interested woman student who 
meets with the above require

Film Series 
To Be Shown 
By Arts Club
A series of Famous Films of 
the Past will be presented by the 
Film Arts club during the month 
of April. The films will be shown 
in IH 104 at 4:30 P.M. on the 
four remaining Fridays of this 
month.
The first film of the series will 
be presented on April 9 and is en
titled Intolerance. This film 
stars Mae Marsh, Sam de Grasse, 
Monte Blue, Milly Langdon, and 
a host of other stars of the silent 
era. The Invisible Man, made in 
1933 and one of the first trick 
films, will be presented on April 
16. Robin Hood, filmed in 1922 
and starring Douglas Fairbanks 
with Wallace Beery will be shown 
on April 23. Two comedies, 
Hands Up! and Two Tars, 
with Ray Griffith and Laurel and 
Hardy, will be presented on April 
30.
Tickets for the series will be on 
sale in Skibo and the Carnegie Inn 
during the week of April 5. No 
tickets will be available at the 
door or for single performances. 
If sufficient interest is shown, the 
series will probably be extended 
into May.
The club is arranging to have a 
brief talk before each film to out
line its particular significance in 
the development of the technique 
of motion picture photography.
Ask for it either way... both 
trade-marks mean the same thing.

Lists for big, nationally-known 
firms are almost always well fill
ed, he continued, but lists for 
the smaller, anjl less well-known 
companies often contain inter
view opportunities that go beg
ging.,
The men are not automatically 
jumping into every vacancy that 
appears, stated Wangeman, for 
they have found that they can get 
the interviews they really want.
He explained that, although the 
Placement office is still crowded 
each morning, there is no longer 
the mad rush to get on a list, 
any list, that there was in recent 
weeks. In fact, he went on, 
only 15 men have had more 
than nine interviews, and should 
they continue at that rate they 
will soon be called in to ex
plain.
Mr. Wangeman emphasized that 
any man who, for a good reason, 
particularly wishes an interview 
with a specific company can have 
his name placed on the list be
fore it is posted. However, he 
warned, this privilege cannot be 
extended an indefinite number of 
times.
The demand for qualified men 
is greater this year than ever be
fore, with some companies look
ing for twice as many men as 
they ordinarily sought before the 
war. The initial salaries being of
fered bachelors candidates range 
from $225 tc $325, depending upon 
the age, experience, and other 
qualifications of the applicants.
He suggested that seniors 
might well investigate the less 
well-known companies through 
the information on file in the 
placements office. Calling atten
tion to a further service of the 
Bureau, he pointed out that the 
Senior Bbok contains letters from 
firms which do not send out in
terviewers. Approximately twice 
as many firms send out letters aa 
send interviewers.

Intramural Program 
Deserves High Praise
By William Schnitten
student interest. At this point theIntramural athletics have 
marched to the front as the most 
spirited activity on campus dur
ing the last few semesters. This is 
mainly because of the interesting 
program established by the ath
letic office. It is time that those 
responsible receive credit for a 
job well done.
Intramural athletics are super
vised by the department headed 
by Mr. David See, a representative 
of the college. He is aided and 
advised by the intramural board, 
composed of student members, 
which acts as the governing body 
on policy questions.
Plans for future events promise 
a program even more comprehen
sive than that of the past. Of pri
mary interest is the arrangement 
with the University of Pittsburgh 
that pits Carnegie intramural 
winners against the Panther 
champions.
During the coming week the 
two old rivals will battle for the 
local collegiate table tennis cham
pionship. The Unknowns won the 
honor of representing CIT by de
feating all other contenders. 
Wrestling, basketball, and soft
ball contests with Pitt are also 
planned.
Intramural competition in ma
jor sports was almost continuous 
on the Skibo scene throughout the 
past year. Football was pushed 
out of the picture by volleyball, 
and now, as bowling bows out, 
the basketball leagues are in the 
midst of a gruelling schedule. All 
this has resulted in a continuous 
enthusiastic spirit.
Next on the agenda are foulshooting, handball, and softball 
along with any other sports that 
can develop enough interest. 
Tartan marksmen are busy solic
iting interest in rifle teams and 
it is entirely feasible that this 
sport will be approved as soon as 
arrangements are completed with 
the ROTC.
Although the intramural board 
approves and welcomes team com
petition, it desires to promote more 
interest in individual competi
tion in such events as badminton, 
table tennis, handball, wrestling, 
archery, and horse shoes. The 
reason for this is that after grad
uation, few men participate ac
tively in team competition, but 
many cling to some less active 
sport for amusement and condiFor a successful intramural pro
gram, good planning is of prime 
importance, but such planning is 
of little avail unless supported by

fraternity and independent groups 
that form the backbone of the pro

their fine support.
In passing out bouquets, all 
basketball fans will agree that the 
new cheerleading staff should not 
be overlooked. After a mid-sea
son reorganization a new group 
was formed which has tackled 
its job in an admirable fashion.
Although the assortment of 
cheers is still inadequate and co
ordination is not altogether per
fect, the new staff shows promise 
of development and is a 100 per
cent improvement over the old

ber that their job is to stimulate

office can be examined by the 
members of Council. In addition, 
the members of the Delta Skull 
committee were invited to attend 
the meeting of April 7 to defend 
their revisions, which will then 
be reconsidered.
Minetti Fund 
A request from Stanley Siegel 
of Interfraternity council for a 
committee of interested people 
from Student Council to take over 
the administration of the $700 A1 
Minetti memorial fund and the 
establishment of the memorial 
was accepted by Council. Presi
dent Ulrich will appoint this com
mittee. ,
Jerome Balls suggestion that a 
notice be placed in the Tartan to 
seek a secretary for the graduat
ing class was approved. Mr. Elliot, 
Executive secretary of the Alumni 
council, will choose among appli
cants if there are more than one. 
If there are none he will select 
someone from among the gradu
ates. Official representatives of the 
graduates will include, in addition 
to the secretary, one representa
tive each from Fine Arts and Margaret Morrison colleges, and two 
from the College of Engineering. 
Film Arts 
A motion approving the revised 
constitution for the Film Arts club 
was accepted after a reading of 
the constitution by Film Arts 
member Robert Abelson. Permis
sion was also granted for Film 
Arts to show a series. of films, 
starting April 9, for four weeks on 
Friday afternoons in the exhibi
tion hall of Fine Arts. A request 
for the use of Thistle hall by 
Dorm Council for a dance on 
April 3 was approved.
During the previous Council 
meeting held on March 24 in the 
Union, president Ulrich told the 
Council members that he would 
like to have a written excuse, a 
phone call, or a personal message 
to me if you are going to be ab
sent. He added that the only 
excuses are death in the family, 
personal illness, or regularly 
scheduled classes. I intend to ask 
for resignations after three unex
cused absences.
Constitution Revision 
Stating that parts of the Stu
dent Council constitution and by
laws need revision, William
Johns proceeded to cite outmoded 
sections of the constitution. How
ever, his motion for revision was 
declared out of order in view of 
the fact that the Constitution pro
vides for its own revision every 
two years. Since a revision is 
scheduled for this year, president 
Ulrich appointed Johns, Jack Se
ward, Dale Wright, Bennard Perl
man, and Mary Louise Thorpe to 
investigate and suggest necessary 
changes.
Committee Appointments
The following appointments of 
Student Council committee chair
man, made by President Ulrich, 
were approved: budget, Paul
Schucker; assistant budget chair
men, Richard Schaffer and Vincent 
Prus; elections, Jack Seward; 
freshmen regulations, Ernest

Varsity Sport Season
Netmen Start Practice In Gym; 
Golfers, Gridders Begin Training
The CIT varsity sports scene 
brightened last week as the ten
nis, golf, track, and football teams 
made plans to swing into action 
outdoors after inclement weath
er had delayed all action.
Coach Moses has been observing 
the limbering up exercises of his 
netmen in the gym and has high 
hopes for the season from his 28 candidates. Jim Taylor, a re
turning letterman, has been nam
ed acting captain for the coming 
season.
Returning to aid Taylor in giv
ing the squad a veteran back
ground are lettermen Bob Schoenberger and Bob Bassett. Many of 
the newcomers have high school 
experience and Coach Moses is 
anxious to watch them in com
petition outdoors in the coming 
weeks.
The Tartan golfers, after prac
ticing for two weeks in the gym, 
will travel to the Pittsburgh field 
club where elimination rounds 
will be held on
26 to determine a six man squad. 
Coach Overend intends to match 
the players cards and pick the 
team by the golfers ability to con
sistently score pars and birdies.
Returning from last years team 
are Ralph Sill, Bill Dean, and 
Gerry OBrien who shoot con
sistently in the 80s. Stan Ketchel, 
another good golfer, intends to 
compete if he wins over his 
present heavy schedule. Supple
menting these veterans are 19 
other hopefuls out for the first 
time.
Last seasons gridders will re
turn to the bowl April 26 for a 
two week training program. Dur
ing this time the coaches intend to 
stress offensive plays against shifting defenses.
Twenty-eight men have ex
pressed their desire for the spring 
drills. Other candidates for the 
team can secure a uniform and locker by signing an
C-Club Installs 
Scoreboards
In Gymnasium
To increase the interest and 
spirit of the student body in in
tercollegiate basketball, the Var
sity C club has promoted the 
building and installation of two 
electrically operated scoreboards 
in the gymnasium.
One will be installed where the 
present board is and the other 
will be placed directly across the 
floor. The boards will be six feet 
wide and four feet high with an 
electric clock twenty inches in di 
ameter in the center. The lucite 
faces of the clocks will automatically light up red during the 
final minute of each quarter as 
well as during all time outs.
It has not yet been decided 
whether the scoring figures will 
appear in lucite or in light bulbs 
but both* methods are being test
ed. The score, clock, and lights 
on both boards will be operated 
from a control box on the of
ficial scorers table.
Robert DeMuesy of the* C club 
announced that the boards will 
be erected and a public demon
stration held before the end of 
the semester.
Foul Shots Decisive In Both Games; 
Final Match To Decide Champion
Warming up after a slow start, the Betas unleashed their scor
ing punch in the second and third quarters and then sat back to 
protect their lead and go on to a 32-31 win over PiKA last Fri
day, April 2. The win evened up the best two-out-of-three game 
series at one game apiece.
---------------------------------- ? Both games were decided from
the free throw line as the Betas 
missed 12 of their 14 free at
tempts in the first game, an over
time thriller, which the PiKAs 
won 33-30.
Led by Fred Hill, who swish
ed the net for all of his eight 
points in the second half, the 
Betas overcame a five point de
ficit at halftime to force a 27-27 
deadlock at the end of regula
tion time. Tightening, their de
fense in the overtime period, the 
PiKAs held their opponents to 
one field goal while building up 
a three point lead to capture the 
first leg on the intramural crown.
Don Armour, with eight points, 
and Chuck Hawley and Ralph Sill, 
each with seven, paced the win
ners attack. It was a two pointer 
by Sill that tied the game up in 
the final seconds. Vic Clay, who 
has been the Betas most con
sistent performer all season, was 
held scoreless.
Betas vs. PiKAs
IM Standings 
Well Balanced
Final intramural basketball 
standings, released by Mr. David 
See of the Department of Intra
mural Athletics, show that both 
leagues were unusually well bal
anced.
The two league titlists, Beta B 
and PiKA, entered the playoffs 
with identical records of 10 wins 
and one defeat. Both defeats were 
administered by the second place 
teams.

In their second meeting, the

quarter, forcing them to shift to 
a man to man defense in the second half. Clay was high man for 
the winners with 12 points, but 
Armour of PiKA took game high 
scoring honors as he found the 
hoop for 14 points. Most of his 
points came in the last few min
utes of the game as the PiKAs, 
ten points behind midway in the 
fourth quarter, threatened to pull 
another game out of the fire.

Editorial
On Instructors
It seems that a recently printed 
article in the Plaid has aroused 
quite a lot of sentiment on the 
campus. The statement that Mr. 
Robert Smith is one of few good 
evening school instructors has 
started a controversy which has 
brought to light many of the 
gripes of evening students. Per
haps the author was wrong in 
making the statement and yet he 
has only stated in print what has 
been voiced many times in student 
discussions.
The question, of course, has its 
pros and cons. We realize that 
most evening teachers, like their 
students, have full time jobs dur
ing the day which absorb their 
greater interest. Some of the 
finest men in their fields, par
ticularly in the engineering de
partments, have accepted positions 
as part-time instructors. Yet 
brilliant as these men may be, for 
the most part they lack the psy
chology and methods which must 
be found in a good instructor. 
Then too, many of these posts are 
filled by graduate students who 
must teach as part of their work 
and who have little or no interest 
in teaching. It is unfair to the 
evening student who pays his full 
share of the tuition income of the 
school to have to sweat out his

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Student Council Head\Scottie Scoops 
Proposes Joining NSA
Student Council president Theodore Ulrich has made public his 
views on the National Student Association. He contends that NSA 
has not been given a chance at CIT, there having been very few ar
ticles in the Tartan on it, with the consequence that few of the 
students know what it stands for or what its aims are.
He explained that he had written for literature on NSA so 
that he might inform the student body of the issues involved.
Viewing NSA in the light that,*
It cant do us any harm, but it 
can do us a lot of good, Ulrich 
added that, I dont think we will 
be helped in getting the athletic 
situation straightened out, but we 
might be able to make some im
provements in our student govern
ment.
The Student Council president 
pointed out that NSA does not 
exist solely as a crusader for stu
dent participation in school ad
ministration. As one of its activi
ties, NSA is sponsoring a three 
month international tour this sum
mer for 100 students. The pur
pose of this trip is to give Ameri
can students an acquaintance with 
the seaboard countries of western 
Europe.
Attacking the objections raised 
against NSA last semester, Ulrich 
said, Students have maintained 
that we have perfect student gov
ernment. If so, why not let some
one else in on it? The last Student
Council president, George Mar
shall, looked on it as a union.
I look on it as a co-operative 
of students who exchange ideas, 
plans, and methods for the better
ment of all through the organiza
tion.
Citing the main objection to 
NSA, which was that it was in
filtrated with communists, fas
cists, and Wallaceites, Ulrich em
phasized that any action taken by 
the national group would not be 
binding on the member student 
bodies.
He disclosed that two members 
of NSA, representing the United 
States at a convention of the In
ternational Student Association in 
Prague recently, had refused to 
affiliate with that group because 
of the heavy communist influence 
in it.
Ulrich further stated that the 
national office of NSA has denied 
relations with all political groups.

to draw up its orbit. We have got 
to educate men not only for to
day but for ten years from now, 
when the problems will be com
pletely different.
Today there is nothing worse 
that you can do for a fellow than 
teach him all he needs to know 
on graduation day. Potential 
knowledge is more important to
day than actual knowledge. 
Rather than just teach a profes
sional student all the known facts, 
he must now be taught to con
tinue to teach himself after he 
finishes school.
You can isolate a professional 
man and restrict him to his own 
profession. We want to make him 
much more of a man, much less 
of a technician.

Printing Class 
Tours East 
On Plant Trip
Thirty-five students of the 
printing department recently made 
a trip to Philadelphia and New 
YOrk to visit some of the larger 
firms. Stanley Hlasta supervised 
the tour, which included tours of 
the Curtis Publishing company, 
Cuneo Press, and the Walter 
Thompson Advertising agency.
The printing department con
ducts this trip so that, by seeing 
such processes as typography and 
collotype in operation plus getting 
an inside view of plant manage
ment and operation, the student 
will be better prepared to handle 
his job in industry.
