under Dr. OBriens direction, one 
year after the Department of Mu
sic was created. He has led the 
orchestra since its inception.
Dozer Will Announce 
Announcing the programs will 
be Carl M. Dozer, a graduate of 
the Department of Music. Mr. 
Dozer has arranged and announc

Westminster Is 6th Liberal Arts School 
Cooperating Under Bright 3-2 Plan
Westminster College is now 
the sixth liberal arts institution 
participating with Carnegie un
der the 3-2 plan of study con
ceived and elaborated by Alan 
Bright, recently deceased regis
trar.
The arrangement with West
minster and with the five other 
schools already operating under 
it provides that the student com
plete three years of work at one 
of these institutions and two 
years (with, in certain cases, 
some summer school work) at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Upon satisfactory completion of 
the entire five-year program, the 
student receives a Bachelor of 
Science degree from Carnegie and 
a Bachelor of Arts degree from 
the first institution.
Mr. Bright proposed the 3-2 
plan as a workable method of 
overcoming the narrowness of a 
four-year engineering course. Un
der the plan, students receive a 
broader foundation in the HumanSing and Swing 
Rules listed
Regulations Given 
For Annual Session
In addition to the entrance 
rules published in the last issue 
of the Tartan, the following rules 
govern the competition among the 
teams entered in the Greek Sing 
and Swing contest.
Contest Rules
I. Contest begins at 8:00 p. m. 
maximum time limited to six 
minutes.
3. Each team shall be allowed to 
sing as many songs as possi
ble in the allotted time.
4. .To avoid repetition, school 
songs shall not be sung by any 
team.
5. Each loam shall be dressed in 
formal clothes.
(J. The judges shall be five disin
terested persons, to be an
nounced at the event.
7. The winning team shall be se
lected on quality of singing, 
singing ability, appeal*of songs, 
composition and originality of 
songs, and appearance and 
promptness of (he team.
8. The award of the cup shall be 
made at the dance after the 
contest to afford the judges 
sufficient time to render the 
decision; the entire winning 
women's team and the entire 
mens team must be present to 
receive the cup. If the win
ning teams ave not present 
when the cups are to be award
ed, the runner-up, if present, 
will receive the award.
9. The winning team shall proba
bly be asked to broadcast at 
the dance when the 'cup is 
presented.
10. The girls singing contest and 
the award will be distinct from 
that for the boyr., and there 
will be a cup for each. Each 
team may use a piano for the 
opening chord. No other in
struments allowed.
II. No individual will be allowed 
to sing on more than one team.
12. The cup for the girls singing 
teams shall be a rotating tro
phy, and the cup shall be the 
property of the winning team 
for a. period of one year. The 
first group to win the cup three 
times " shall retire the award 
permanently.
ities and the social sciences.
Many prospective engineering 
students desire a broader training 
than can. be secured in a fouryear course in an engineering 
school, but hesitate to under
take a program involving four 
years of undergraduate work at 
a liberal college followed by two 
or three years at an engineering 
school.
To such students the arrange
ment conceived by Mr. Bright 
makes possible an engineering 
training based on a good liberal 
arts background with the saving 
of at least one year with degrees 
from both institutions.
The first colleges to participate 
under this plan were Allegheny 
and Washington and Jefferson. 
The agreement in both cases was 
approved on March 28, 1938.
Since then, in rapid succession, 
Albion, Geneva, Dennison, and 
now Westminster have made the 
necessary arrangements.
The liberal arts college is re
quired to adapt its curriculum to 
preparation for engineering.
Courses are so arranged that 
the student may at the end of 
three years enter Tech as a fullfledged junior in the course of 
engineering he has elected, with 
no deficiencies.

Will Be Placed 
In New Library
CarnegiT ch asT Scgit
Now on view on1 the first floor 
of the Administration Hall is  
memorial to the late Dr. Thom
as Baker which has been prepar
ed through the. joint efforts of a 
faculty and administration com
mittee. The. memorial, an album 
bound in blue leather, was en
grossed and illuminated by Dr. 
Coit R. Hoechst, Director of Pittsr 
burgh Night School. Beneath the 
picture of Dr. Baker now in the 
Union, the memorial will even
tually be placed in th planned 
school library.
Dr. Baker was second President 
of Carnegie. He retired in Sep
tember, 1935, because of ill 
health and was appointd Presi
dent Emeritus by the Board of 
Trustees. Last April, Dr. Baker 
died.
The wording of the memorial is 
as follows:

Tea Dance Aims 
At Stray Shekels
This aint no April Fool! There 
will be a tea dance at Thistle 
Hall from four to six on April; 
firstand those who dont come 
will be the Fools.
Admission is only a quarter. It 
provides for dancing to the music 
of name bands (phonograph, of 
course) and a chance to win a 
door prize. There will be enter
tainment, too (ideas, stolen from 
the successful Guild bazaar). Re
freshments (Coca Cola) will be 
available but wont be included 
in the admission; the sponsors 
have to make money some way.
Alpha Chi Alpha, womens 
journalistic honorary, is the or
ganization that is giving you this 
wonderful opportunity. And the 
women are not doing it because 
they want to buy an apple tree 
for the deantheyre doing it .to 
make money so that you (and' Ido mean you) can see what hap
pens when Techits try to write 
in other words, its for the 
Bard.
Because the dance is being held 
during school hours, a large turn
out is expected. A doctor will be 
present to write out absence ex
cuses.
Come early and be in the rush!
Spring Elections

Bagpipers!
Music Department 
To Give Lessons
Department of Music is issuing 
a call to all students interested in 
learning to play the bagpipes. A 
meeting of the prospective pupils 
will be held Satuiday, March 30, 
at 1 oclock.
Lewis W. Davidson will teach 
the class. He intends to use the 
group-instruction method which 
will reduce the cost of the lessons.
Members will be required to 
purchase chanters, an oboe-like 
instrument, for preliminary study. 
It is hoped that the success of 
this project will be warranted by 
the appearance of bagpipers, in 
the Kiltie Band next fall.
Stage Door 
To Be Given
Elmer W. Hickman 
Directs Production
Edna Ferber and George S. 
Kaufmans play, Stage Door, 
which was one of the outstanding 
attractions ori Broadway four 
years ago, will be the next pre
sentation by the Department of 
Drama. This seventh show of the 
year will be directed, by Elmer 
W. Hickman: Samuel Liff 41,. is 
designing the sets.
It is the story of a girls board
ing house in New York City, in 
which the tenants are all connect
ed with the theatre. Some have 
jobs, some do not; some reach the 
heights; others fall in opposite 
direction. The leading role, that of 
Terry Randall, will be played by 
Mary Lewis 40 and Norma Shea 
40.
Students playing other import
ant roles are: Cort Steen 40 and 
Paul England 40 as David Kings
ley; Robert Finkel 40, and O. P. 
Keeney 40 as Keith Burgess; 
Teddy Malinich 42 single cast as 
Big Mary; and Maurice Forbes 42 
and Jean Grant 42 as Jean Mait
land.
The drama takes place in the 
Footlights Club in the West Fif
ties in New York City. It de
scribes the struggles of the val
iant young people who try to re
main loyal to the theatre despite 
its neglect of them. The play is 
not devoid of sentimentality 
despite its humor, but it touches 
a raw wound in view of the the
atres doldrums.
New Trumpet 
Prof Appointed
James H. Morrow has been se
lected as part-time trumpet in
structor in the Department of 
Music to replace the late Louis J. 
Panella. Mr. Morrow is a gradu

in the Old Alban Theater orches
tra. He was a charter member of 
the KDKA Little Symphony 
which pioneered in the field of 
music possibilities for radio. He 
also played in the Westinghouse 
Band, the first band ever to 
broadcast. In still another branch 
of music Mr. Morrow led the way; 
he was the first instructor of brass 
in the Pittsburgh Public Schools. 
I-Ie held this position in 1921-22.

I*u hi 4*. Private Colleges 
Are 44Ilemarkai>ly Similar
The recent annual report of the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching revealed some interesting infor
mation. By far the most important is the fact that public col
leges have advanced to the point where they are now remark
ably similar in all respects to private institutions. According 
to Dr. Walter A. Jessup, President of the Foundation, the two 
types of institutions admit much the same type of student, 
turn out the same end product, the graduate, reveal indis
tinguishable attitudes toward their social responsibilities, 
have much the same standards and working conditions for their 
faculties, and similar physical equipment.
In pointing out the most striking differences between the 
two, Dr. Jessup quoted from the recent survey of the U. S. Office 
of Education to show that private institutions expend rela
tively more for administration (14.9 as against 9.6 per cent) 
whereas public colleges and universities spend proportionately 
more for research (8 as against 3.7 per cent). In both cases 
certain subjects are favored, and certain subjects, like Latin and 
Greek, are finding their way out of our eurriculi.
With the financial troubles that private institutions are 
encountering, and with public institutions catching up to them, 
it may be that in future years public institutions will be favored. 
In many respects public colleges are hampered. They are sup
ported by, hence answerable to, the public. They are often 
held back by inertia-ridden state legislatures. A program like 
the Carnegie Tech Social Relations department could not have 
been adopted so quickly in a public college.
But private institutions should do even more. In public col
leges students feel more free to criticize the curriculum and the 
faculty. Students in endowed colleges are often forced to 
stomach incompetent instructors or poorly organized courses. If 
there could be some means ol! allowing students to express 
opinions about faculty and curriculum, and allowing students 
to help in shaping better, more progressive programs, the effect 
would be beneficial to both the students and the private colleges.

Tnu Beta Pi
To fill a place in the engineer
ing educational institutions of this 
country similar to that of Phi 
Beta Kappa in liberal arts, Tuu 
Bota PI was founded in the lat
ter part of the last century. How
ever, since such quail ties as per
sonality, integrity, and breadth of 
interest both inside and outside 
ol' engineering are requisites for 
a versatile and successful career 
jn the engineering profession, se
lection is based on considerations 
.of these qunlitics, in addition to
 high scholastic standing.
Growing steadily, the society 
now has sixty-eight chapters lo
cated in the leading engineering 
schools of the country. Among its 
. members may be found some of 
. the most eminent men in engin
eering.
 (But Tau Beta Pi does not wish 
: to be merely a society for mutual 
:admiration. There, pre numerous 
.ways in which the school and fel3 low students can be served. The 
chapter acts as a medium of bet ter understanding between the 
^faculty and the students. A com

REVIVERS OF HOCKEY AT TECH 
END CAREERS
i By "DOC BURKE, Sports Editor
Four years ago a group oJ: ambitious Freshman started a 
I hockey team at Carnegie Tech. Of that group Bud Wilson, Art 
Burleigh, Verne Sehilawske, and Don Ament have played the 
j entire four years, iimshing their college careers last Saturday 
j afternoon against Duquesne. This record is truly enviable when 
I one considers the handicaps that have been met and overcome.
Besides these four standbys, Bill Goldsmith and Jack Cul
ver were on that team that brought hockey back to Carnegie.
I These latter two were compelled to drop out of competition after 
I two years of play.
It is to be hoped that the good work done by the above men
tioned will be continued in the future, and that Carnegie will
i keep hockey on its sports program.

I Jottings About This and That
Now that hockey season is over, First and Second All|League teams have been submitted to us by our roving hockey 
correspondent. The teams are:
First TeamG. Feiler, Carnegie; L. D.Rancourt, John 
Carroll; R. D.Forward, 'Western Reserve; C.Vance, Du
quesne ; Tj. W.Arsenault, John Carroll; and R. W. McGill, 
Duquesne.
Second TeamG. Zimmerman, Fenn; L. D.Wilson, 'Car
negie; R. D. Rusliman, Duquesne; C.-Carran, Western Reserve; 
Tj. W. Gibson, Case School; and R. W.Burleigh, Carnegie.
It has been suggested to this department that some sports 
that receive minor letters be raised to the major letter class. It 
has been pointed out that the members of the swimming and 
hockey teams especially deserve major Cs. Those who have 
made this suggestion base their claim 011 the fact that track is 
a ma jor letter sport.
Our opinion-whether it has been asked for or notis that 
Football and basketball deserve major awards Without a doubt, 
and that hockey , and swimming should receive the same as 
track regardless 6f what it is. Possibly, the best solution would 
11>( just two major letter sports.__________________________________

Duquesne leers Down 
Tech I11 Final Match
Five Seniors Play 
In Final Game of 
College Careers
Striving to gain their first vic
tory over a Duquesne Hockey 
team, the Tartan icers failed in a 
close 2-1 game last Saturday af
ternoon. This defeat marked the 
end of a not too successful season.
The first period was fairly even 
with the Dukes on the offensive. 
In the second period, Tech came 
back into things with a goal by 
Burleigh on an assist from Wil
son. For the remaining five min
utes, the Plaid kept the puck near 
the Duke net but to no avail. 
Lady Luck was sitting on top of 
Goalie McMillans shoulders and 
several times he made saves .that 
were plain lucky. Bud Wilson 
played most of the game at cen
ter, and the all Senior line of Wil
son, Burliegh, and Schwilawske 
played their last game in great 
fashion. Ray Ely on defense and
Don Ament on wing were the oth
er seniors who finished their 
hockey careers. Hal Herre was 
out of town for the contest.
While the ledgers showed only 
four victories as compared to nine 
defeats, every game was close 
and hard fought. Six of these 
games were lost by only one 
point. Next years team will be 
built around Goalie Feiler and 
should be fairly strong.

Held by Team Coach
Last Saturday evening Coach 
Allen E. Risedorph held his an
nual get-together for the mem

ming Team. During the course 
of the evening these Skibo mer
men cast their votes for the cap
tain of this aggregation during the 
1940-41 season. The final tabu
lation of these ballots showed Bill 
Molvie, a Junior Mechaniral En
gineer, to be the chosen leader 
of the Tartan swimming forces.
Fortunately for Carnegie, Bill 
decided to enter the field of 
Engineering and entered Tech in 
1937, having spent, a year in 
Liberal Arts College of W & 
J. Sir Will has spent the 
major portion of his life 
roaming over the hills of Dormont, and it was in this hamlet 
that Bill got his high school ed
ucation. During Bills four years 
in Dormont High the school had 
no swimming team, so Techs new 
captain took it upon himself 
get together a local group of swim
mers and form a team.
Delt Bowlers

Old Paintings 
Differ From 
Modern Art
Now on exhibit at the Carnegie 
Institute is a collection of world 
famous paintings which will af
ford the people of Pittsburgh a 
rare opportunity to view some of 
the greatest art works of all time.
There has been much dispute 
over the relative merits of mod
ern and old world art. This exhib
it will allow the average person 
to compare recognized works with 
recent specimens of surrealism 
and cubism.
Modern Art Differs 
Included in the show are Tin
torettos Lucretia and Tarquinius, Rembrandts Self Por
trait, Le Nains Blacksmith, 
and Poussins Rescue of Young 
Pyrrhus.
The most impressive feature of 
the exhibit is the glow of rich 
color which greets the visitor as 
he first enters the gallery. The 
dull hues and the flabby spotches 
which characterize a modern ex
hibition are noticeably absent. 
The old masters, it seems, were 
more generous with color than are 
their descendants. Wether tiiTs is 
due. to the degeneration of art or 
to the effect of the blue world 
in which we live remains to be 
seen.
Valuable Collection i
If the visitor is entirely ignor
ant of the principles of art he will 
still enjoy the show. The thrill 
experienced When one realizes 
that he is looking at a canvas val
ued at thousands of dollars is 
sufficient to make the collection 
fascinating. The exhibit is insur
ed at $3,000,000.
Humour Not Lacking 
Humour is not entirely lacking 
in this seemingly dull aggrega
tion. The Sharper, by De La 
Tour depicts a humorous incident 
in the life of. a court jester. One 
glance reveals the whole situa
tion; a heated card game .Is in 
progress; the person who is win
ning has two aces neatly tucked 
under his belt. The sudden dawn 
of suspicion on the faces of the 
other players is caught very nice
ly by De La Tour. This painting 
makes a bright spot in the exhib
it and balances the more sombre 
works.

Thomas Stockham Baker join
ed the administrative staff of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
in February 1919. He became Act
ing President in 1922, and in Feb
ruary 1923, the Board of Trus

his resignation in the autumn of 
1935, Dr. Baker was made Presi
dent Emeritus and a member of 
the Board of Trustees. During all 
these years his loyalty to the in
stitution knew no limits.
By his diligent, earnest work 
and insistence upon high scholas
tic standards, Dr. Baker advanced 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
to a high rank among American 
institutions of learning, and 
spread the fame of our school 
throughout this country and 
abroad. Being keenly interested 
in research, he established and 
organized international coal con
ferences, which have received 
world-wide recognition because 
of their contribution to science 
and industry. By his unfailing 
courtesy and his sincere interest 
in the students and members of 
the faculty and their families, he 
built in the institution a fine spir

constant interest and indefatig
able spirit of cooperation he con

community which this institution 
serves.

At 2 P. M. last Friday one or 
our espionage agents happened to 
be out at the County Airport 
just minding his .own business. He 
was on the point of leaving when 
he saw a familiar figurefamil
iar face, too, as a matter of fact 
boarding the New York plane. 
It was Bernie Lebovit, editor of 
the Tartan.
The Tartan, you must know is 
an honest paper. It has no deal
ings with gangsters, theres no 
counterfeiting outfit at the print
ing plant and no dead bodies in 
the filing cabinet; it was rather a 
shock, therefore, for our spy to 
learn that Bernie was on his way 
to New York City and eventually 
to Ossining, New York, which is 
a polite way of saying Sing Sing 
or practically.
Before the G-men come into 
the Tartan office and padlock the 
typewriters, wed better make it 
clear that the whole thing isnt 
as bad as it sounds. The amaz
ing Dr. Lebovit isnt the master 
mind of any crime ring.
Bernie, it seems, along with 
other editors of Eastern college 
newspapers, was invited to Os
sining by 20th Century Fox to see | 
the world premier of Johnny 
Apollo," a picture about, a real 
life situation that a college boy 
laces when he graduates. (As if 
the seniors havent enough to 
worry about!) Why the showing
was held a stones throw from 
Sing Sing prison we have no idea, 
unless its to show the boys a 
horrible example of what hap
pens when you .dont follow the 
advice of 20th Century Fox and 
the Hays office.
The trip fell in the laps of 
Bernie and the others with all ex
penses paid. They got put up 
not in a cell roombut at the St. 
Moritz, no less. They got a plane 
ride to New York and back. 
Everything was paid for by the 
studio, including something- which 
20th Century mysteriously calls 
entertainment. (Not knowing 
the ways of the big city, we in
nocently and fervently hope that 
that means a trip to Grants 
tomb).
We do know one thing, though. 
If the Tartan editorials from now 
on end and so this picture is a 
must for Tech students, as well 
as their friends and families, we 
bet we can guess what picture the 
editor is talking about.
(Back from the trip, Bernie ex
plains that there were no strings 
attached, but that he and the oth
er editors were simply guest 
| critics at the sneak preview. 
A sneak preview?,, by the way, is 
one in which an unsuspecting au
dience in an out of the way town 
has a new picture shown to them 
that is not on the bill. He refused 
to comment on the entertain
ment").

Clarence H. Carter, Professor 
in the Painting and Design De

his painting, Summer Storm, 
has been purchased in Florida by 
Barbara Hutton, Woolworth heir
ess. The canvas was part of a 
travelling show sent out from 
New York to Palm Beach, Clear
water, and Tampa, in an effort to 
make Florida more art-conscious. Forty-two American 
painters were invited to send can
vasses to the exhibition.
When Professor Carter heard 
that Summer Storm had been 
sold, he said, I am very glad 
that my painting is out in the 
world. He said that he never re
grets losing a painting by hav
ing it soldi-ather does he enjoy 
seeing his work give some mea

Others of his Works are now

New Research 
In Science 
Is Discussed
Modern Centrifuges 
Are Explained 
Hy Prof. Beams
Forces equal, to 8,000,000 times 
the force of gravity are now 
iivaliable for the use o scientific 
research through new advances 
in high-speed centrifuges that 
spin in a vacuum, Prof. <T. W. 
Beams of the University of Vir
ginia told the Carnegie chapter 
of Sigma Xi last Friday in a spe
cial lecture arranged by this na
tional honor society for the pro
motion of research in science.
High Speeds
Highest rotational speeds at
tained, Prof. Beams said, are 1,- 
500,000 revolutions per minute. 
The upward limit of speed is fix
ed only by the strength of the ma
terials of which the centrifuge 
rotor is composed.
The most difficult experimental 
problem for which the centrifuge 
is used is, perhaps, the separation 
of the isotopes of the elements. 
Isotopes are varieties of an ele
ment which have similar chem
ical properties but slightly differ
ent weights.
The two isotopes of chlorine 
having mass 35 and 37 have been 
separated and concentrated by 
whirling carbon tetrachloride (the 
cleaning fluid) at speeds of 1,560 
revolutions per second, or 93,600 
limes a minute, Prof. Beams said.
Fast Centrifuge Speed
Because the stable isotopes of 
chlorine and other elements can 
, be used as tags for tracing out 
chemical reactions in the test 
tube, and the animal and human 
bodies, their separation has im
portant applications. The task of 
separation is not only one of un
tangling the fractions by extreme 
centrifugal force, but also is a 
problem of securing great enough 
yields to do the task in a reason
able time and without too much 
work. This means that the cen
trifuge should not only spin fast 
but that it should have a large 
capacity.
i Prof. Beams pointed out that 
increasing the diameter of the 
centrifuge rotor ultimately qnds 
in fracture of the device; so in or
der to get larger capacities the 
newest method is to make the ro
tor of long, cylindrical shape. Ro
tors that are a foot long and 
which have an inside diameter 
of three Inches arc now being 
successfully spun in rapid rota
tion.
Gas Soparntlons
For the separation of nitro-oxygen, nitrogen-carbon dioxide 
mixtures and. the chlorine iso
topes in ethyl chloride, a vapor, a 
cylinder is spun which weighs 36 
pounds, in all. This has a capacity 
of three grams a minute. When in 
rotation at 1100 revolutions per 
second such a rotor has stored in 
it 1,500,00 ' foot-pounds of ener
gy, Prof. Beams explained.
While the task of,trying to sep
arate the isotopes with a centri
fuge represents a very difficult 
problem the isolation of biologic
al and medical substances offers a 
ready field for applications of 
such devices.
A great many biological and 
medical substances have been 
purified and their molecular 
weights and sizes studied, he 
said. Svedberg and his collab
orators, and many others, have 
shown that most of the easily sol
uble native proteins are compos
ed of homogeneous molecular 
species. Also they have found a 
regularity in the molecular 
weights of these proteins which 
Svedberg interprets as indication 
that their molecules are made up 
of definite fundamental units 
which have masses of about 17,- 
600. 1-Ie assumes that only a few 
of these aggregates are stable, 
and the greater the molecular 
weight the fewer are the possibil
ities of stable aggregation.
"Some of the proteins have 
their structure altered by such 
things as solution change in 
pH (acidity) value, or small 
amounts. of foreign matter. 
For example, by changing the 
pH value of haemocyanin Helix 
Iomatia (the color pigmant in the 
blood of the European species of 
edible snail) of molecular weight 
6,7-10,000 by a small amount, it 
dissociates by steps into halves, 
eighths, and sixteenths, each dis
sociation product being a homo
geneous molecular species.

Mr. Melton arrived in Pitts

by an entourage of Delts, Tech 
and Pitt, and introduced to the 
city with due ceremony.
The proverbial Scottish luck

Or maybe it was the spirits in

Steamed Up
Carnegies Own Power Plant 
Keeps Hummin Right Along
By Leonard Shatzkin 
We are definitely in a position 
to scotch all rumors that the Car
negie power plant is due for the 
scrap heap. There are plenty of 
kilowatt hours in the old dyna
mos yet/ and there will be for 
many a year.
As a matter of fact, due to re
pairs made during the past five 
years, the plant is in better con
dition than it ever was, although 
no one can deny that a new plant 
would be far more efficient.
The plant under Machinery 
Hall, has been taking care of light, 
power, and the hot water and 
steam heating systems for Car
negie since 1905, and it has no 
intention of stopping now. When 
the school was built, a gas en
gine, the embryo of the present 
large plant, was installed and it is 
still in service. As early as 1908 
it was found necessary to add a 
300 kilowatt steam engine.
Further additions have brought 
capacity up to 1050 kilowatts. 
The engine capacity must be suf
ficient to insure a reserve equal 
to the peak demanded which is 
about 500 kilowatts. Power for 
the entire campus except Mar
garet Morrison, the gym, faculty 
houses and dormitories, is sup
plied by the plant. Duquesne 
Light and Power Co. supplies the 
power for those buildings, 
amounting to 25% of that used by 
the school.
Heating System 
The exhaust from the engines 
is used to heat water circulated 
through the school radiator sys
tem for heating the college build
ings. On normal days exhaust 
steam provides sufficient heat. On 
zero days a little live steam is 
added to the exhaust steam to 
coax the temperature up.
A battery of four tremendous 
boilers, buried deep in the earth 
beneath the engines, provides the
steam to keep the system sizzling 
along. On normal days only num
ber one boiler, a 750 horsepower 
affair, is used, but the other three 
are ready for emergency or mid
winter weather. The fire tempera
ture of 2200 Fahrenheit gener
ated in the boiler protects the 
boiler crew from frostbite. On av
erage autumn days the boiler 
consumes 20 tons of coal, but 
when cold sets in that figure goes 
up to 65 tons. All operations 'are 
designed to be as automatic as 
jaiioq am o^ paujEa sr 11203 'oob 
possible, even stoking the furnand dumped in by an pverhead 
crane.
Pittsburgh water aggravates the 
problem of keeping the boiler 
free from scale-forming impuri
ties which would deteriorate the 
metal. To correct the chemical 
content of the make-up water, a 
water softening plant has been 
installed as an integral part of 
the system. The water is also 
heated before it enteis the boilers 
to remove any excess oxygen. The 
pressure: of the water entering 
the boiler is automatically main
tained by a governor at 15 pounds 
above steam pressure.
Purifying Water
The water softening apparatus 
removes the calcium and mag
nesium salts and substitutes sol
uble sodium salts. This is also 
done automatically; checking 
once 01* twice a day is sufficient. 
Both the city water and the water
DHOOGU LMOSB NJCo 
JG you AOsVZ 
DHOlGU J EBRUCZ
in the boiler are tested every day. 
The concentration of salts in the 
boiler is kept well below the point 
which would permit salts to en
ter the pipe lines.
Several years ago when the 
power demand went above 500 
kilowatts the problem arose of 
maintaining the reserve. Since it 
was cheaper to buy power than it 
Would be to install new machin
ery to produce the extra amount, 
Duquesne Light Co. was asked to 
provide current to meet the new 
demand. The transformer handl
ing Duquesnes power is located 
in the basement of Margaret Mor
rison College. This equipment, in
stalled two years ago, is the only 
major addition to the plant.
What happens to the current 
produced here? It is maintained in 
the power lines at 240 volts, direct 
current. A transformer supplied 
by Duquesne Light Co. provides 
alternating current for the lab
oratory work. The plant supplies 
light and the power for electrical
ly driven machinery throughout 
the school. The load kept rising 
by 10 to 20 per cent each year 
until last year. A drive to keep 
unnecessary lights turned off re
sulted in a marked decrease in 
consumption of current.
Surprisingly enough the great
est drain in current comes not in 
the labs or shops, but in the Arts 
buildingand no one seems to 
know why.

Scholarship Dance
Honorary Group 
Features Music
By FritschieC
On Saturday evening, March 30, 
1940, Nu Sigma Alpha, night 
school honorary fraternity pre
sents its second Robert B. Leighou 
Memorial Scholarship Dance in 
Thistle Hall. This is the fra
ternitys second dance of the year 
and looking back on the past suc
cessful affairs, this promises to 
be even more successful.
The orchestra engaged for. this 
dance is Herbert Fritschie and bis 
Music with a Smile. He need 
no introduction as he has played 
on the campus several times and 
just recently closed a five weeks 
engagement at the popular night 
spot New Penn. His sweet and 
enchanting musical rythm may 
well be remembered by those who 
attended the Engineers Christmas 
dftvn in 1930. Even thatywise old 
gentleman Confuscious says, lie 
who miss, Music with a Smile, will 
be velly velly sad foiv long, long 
while.
Thistle Hall, always a beautiful 
setting for a dance, will be fur
ther enhanced by gay red and 
black decorations, the colors of 
the fraternity. Those who have 
attended these dances previously 
certainly dont want to pass up 
this opportunity to swing out, and 
those who havent as yet attend
ed this function have missed a 
swell affair. Come out and see for 
yourself.
Coming, as the dance does, the 
first Saturday after the Easter 
holidays, there should be many 
who are anxious to again go danc
ing. What better opportunity 
could be had?
The dnnce is an important func
tion of the organization inasmuch 
as it is one of the mediums 
through which funds are raised 
for their Robert B. Leighou Schol
arship Fund. It, is the fraternitys 
desire to be able to present in 
the very near future,1'through the 
success of these affairs, a scholar
ship each year to some deserving 
night school student to perpetuate 
the memory of Professor Robert B. 
Leighou, their patron member.
Tickets at $1.00 per couple may 
be purchased from members of the 
fraternity or at the door. Be 
sure to come for you are all in
vited to attend.
The dance is under the direction 
of Chester Biscup, ably assisted 
by Harold E. Parks and Stephen 
Marcinizyn.
Pen Points
-Ed NussSunday this war - wracked 
world of ours will stop its crazy 
race to oblivion long enough to 
pay tribute to the one man whose 
life was dedicated to peace, at 
least those of us still fortunate 
enough to be wakened by the ring 
of an alarm clock instead of the 
blare of a bugle will.
Most of us will go to a regular 
church service, some of us may 
eveii be enthusiastic enough to 
attend, a sunrise service, but how 
many of us will pause long 
enough to really think of what the 
day means? How many of us will 
remember the real reason for com
memorating this day? How many 
of us will remember the teach
ings He gave us, or the trials He 
suffered in an endeavor to make 
this a better place in which to 
live? Or how many of us will 
be able to truthfully say that we 
have tried to live as He would 
have wanted us to?too few of 
us Im afraid.
Most of us seem to be laboring 
under the misapprehension that 
going to church regularly is all 
that is required or a good Chris
tian. In my estimation that is 
the least important, of all the re
quisites. The person who really 
applies those truths He gave us 
is the real Christian regardless of 
whether or not he ever attends 
church. Let's all try to be that 
type of person.
We dont get around much be
ing just a couple of Fine Arts girls, 
but we are going to do our best 
to dish out for you this week in 
the absence of the Winchellian 
genius who runs this column.
We would like to tell you about 
people you know. After all 
whats it to you if a sculp class boy 
named Scott Nevin has a girl 
friend in school in Frederick, 
Maryland. It means a lot to us 
but not to you, so we are going 
to tell you about our editor.
Our Editor always turns up 
with something new at our dances, 
aM you people who dont think so 
just havent been around, thats 
all. At the Engineers dance, it 
was Virginia, and although we 
couldnt see anything but green, 
they tell us she was complete with 
big, blue -?yes. Not bad at all 
for a blond.
Have you ife?n Sam BisjMne, the 
hydraulics maK? very suave, 
girls. Imagine! Mabel never even 
suspects, we bet, that he brings 
two of the nicest girls we know 
to class and home again every 
Tuesday night. Very suave  up 
until now.
Monaca hasnt been getting the 
credit it should. All year, every 
Tuesday and Thursday nights, it 
has been shipping us its champion 
jitterbugwell, she looks like the 
champion to us, and . up on Monaca 
boys, even the old men and babies 
jitter. Gather round Caroline 
Brown some night in Arts mar
ble corridors for free demonstra
tion.
And so we come to Advice for 
the Lovelornluscious blonds es
pecially certain ones really owe 
it to society to go steady with 
more than on guy.
Next week, the old master will 
be back with sensation expose, 
maybe.
Art Students 
Dance In Gym
Ray Maffic Makes 
Initial Appearance
Another brand new orchestra, 
Ray Matties, invaded the Carnegie 
Tech evening campus last Sat
urday evening to furnish music 
for the Fine Arts groups St. Pat
ricks Day Dance. A jam-packed 
Gym-ful of merrymaking couples 
turned out to greet them.
Featured in the arrangements 
for the event was an attempt to 
make dancing safe for sane peo
ple. Although rumor has it that 
the MatTle outfit turns out a hot 
brand of jive, jitterbug dancing 
was forbidden on the main dance 
floor. Couples who heard the call 
of swing were relegated to the 
stage platform to work out their 
energies until the frenzy passed.
Decorations, taking their cue 
from the Irish festival, follow
ed a green motif. Programs, too, 
were designed with green covers 
to make use of the St. Patricks 
Day theme. Arrangements indi
cated, however, that there was 
nothing green about the staff 
that, prepared the Gym for the 
dance.
Full use was made of the fa
cilities which the ample dimen
sions of the Gym offer. The rep
utation for fine entertainment 
which the Fine Arts group has es
tablished more than offset the ef
fect of a heavy social schedule, 
which brought three dances on as 
many successive Saturday eve
nings.
Paper Activities 
Cease Temporarily
Easter vacation will bring the 
evening students of Tech a respite 
from more than classes, for the 
staff of the Plaid, who, incidental
ly attend school too, will naturally 
have a vacation.
This, therefore, will be the last 
issue of the paper which you stu
dents will receive until the week 
of April 9th. Happy Easter, you 
eggs.
N. ROLLINGER
Rollinger Is 
New Officer
Drafting Student 
Honored liy College
The genial young man look
ing out of the picture is Nicholas 
Rollinger, president of the Vo
cational Courses of Evening Col
lege.-of Engineering. This group 
is more generally known under its 
old name 'of Industries College.
Nick, who. hails from Forest 
Hills, has been attending Carne
gie Evening School for three years. 
1-Ie is enrolled as a\ mechanical 
drafting student and \vill prob
ably enter Engineering at the. com
pletion of his course. He isjnow 
employed as a machinist, by 
Westinghouse Electric & Manu
facturing Company, in the Switph 
Gear Department, which is ohe 
of their key departments. V
From the Forest Hills School,' 
where Nick learned the ABCs, he 
migrated to Wilkinsburg High 
School where he made many 
friends among faculty and stu
dents. He was graduated in 1933 
with the reputation of being a 
good scholar and a better golfer, 
having played on their golf team. 
He retains his skill in this sport, 
shooting consistently in the 70s, 
close to par. Incidentally, the 
heartiest wish of Nicks golfing 
friends is to find a fairway on 
which the grass would be kept as 
closely cropped as Nicks hair.
Nick was also a member of the 
orchestra in high school. His 
early training with the violin 
proved valuable and he thorough
ly enjoyed the experience and ad
ditional training received with the 
orchestra. He believes in keep
ing his fiddle fingers supple and 
almost any evening when Nick is 
ot in school, he will be found for 
a short time at least in front of his 
radio playing along with some con
cert pianist or violinist. This is 
one of Nicks pet diversions, the 
others apparently being nurses 
and golf.
As an Actvities worker, he first 
attracted the attention of his fellow-workers by his practice of 
working earnestly at his assign
ment, meanwhile saying nothing. 
He is a member of Nu Sigma Al
pha Fraternity.
Nite Engineers 
Change Date 
Of Banquet
Frank J. Young, president of 
the College of Engineering, has 
announced a change of date for 
the Engineers banquet.
This affair is usually held dur
ing the first week of April, but 
due to a rather congested social 
schedule during March, and the 
difficulty in securing a hotel and 
show for the earlier date, the of
ficers decided on a later date.
Saturday, April 27 is the new 
date and the ballroom of the 
Hotel Schenley is the place.
For a complete evening of en
tertainment remember Saturday, 
April 27th and the Engineers 
Banquet.

At the meeting of the Evening 
Student Council held Sunday, 
March 3, 1940, Dr. B. E. Warden, 
Dean of Men, and Mr. David 
Sloan, Business Manager of the 
Carnegie Tartan were present at 
the invitation of President Mar
cinizyn.
A difficulty has arisen since 
mailing of the Tartan was begun 
by Council. Since the Tartan has 
become a semi-weeldy publica
tion, the second-class mailing per
mit under which the former 
weekly publication Was mailed is 
void. Under this permit all pap
ers had been mailed by weight. 
Mailing permits are based on the 
issues published per week and not 
the number of times mailed.
A second-class mailing permit 
for a semi-weekly publication re
quires that we put a one cent 
stamp on each paper mailed with
in the Pittsburgh post office dis
trict. This would cost Council an 
extra expenditure of over $2.00 
per week or over $200.00 for the 
semester. Papers may still be, 
mailed to students in the suburb
an district by weight. Unless the 
permits can be changed the only 
possibility of eliminating this ad
ditional expense is to have the 
Tartan changed back to a weekly 
publication. If this cannot be done 
it may be necessary to change 
the mailing of the Plaid.
A lengthy discussion was held 
with Dr. Warden about fees and 
changes in policy that have taken 
place recently and which deeply 
concern Council. The idea of col
lecting fifty cc^its per semester 
for each student registered and 
turning it over to Council, as prer 
sented in Dr. DohWtys letter to 
Council, was agreed upon by 
Council with the condition that a 
fuller explanation be printed in 
the next catalog, showing Mjat in
cluded in the General Fee, W'hich 
would be, equal for each sempsier, 
is a fifty cent per semester' Stu^ 
dent Activity Fee, which is turned 
over to the Evening otuaent 
Council to finance its program. 
Council members expressed a de
sire to be certain that there 
would be no change of policy in 
the future of Councils receiving 
a Student Activity Fee for each 
student in the amount mentioned 
above.
Final date of Council-Faculty 
and Administration dinner is 
April 4, 1940.

Evening Students and Teachers 
Exhibit Works in Annual Show
For the thirtieth consecutive 
year, the Associated Artists of 
Pittsburgh presented at the Car
negie Institute Galleries their An
nual Exhibition of the oil and 
water color paintings, black and 
white sketches, sculpture, and 
crafts of their members; a group 
of about fifteen hundred artists 
from Pittsburgh and Western 
Pennsylvania. The Exhibition, 
which began February 8th and 
closed March 10th, offered almost 
two dozen works by students of 
the Evening College of Fine Arts, 
and fully as many by their pro
fessors and instructors, who in 
many cases also serve on the day 
school faculty.
Evening and part time students 
whose works were presented are: 
Dorothy L. Davids, Gregory Federoff, James J. Fisher, Pinkey 
Gott, Edith M. Gray, Francis L. 
Komperda, Henry Lisi, Andrew J. 
Pribisco, Alan Thompson, and 
Daniel N. Weisser. Of more than 
passing interest were Jim Fishers 
Rest, picturing a darky sleep
ing behind an old stable. Dan 
Weissers study of elliptical fig
ures in a still life to which he 
gave the title, Gunsmiths Work
bench; Alan Thompsons timely 
work called A Crowded Street 
Car, and Henry Lisis colorful
summer painting of Scene at 
Ashtabula.
A good majority of the faculty 
of the Department of Painting and 
Design, Sculpture, and Architec
ture had their works in the Ex
hibit: Professors Carter, Clayter
Edmonds, Ellis, Hilton, Hyde, 
MacGilvary, McLeary, Murdock, 
Readio, Rosenberg, Simboli and 
Warner, and Messrs. Gwathmey, 
Lepper, and Riggs.
Mr. Lepper presented an oil 
painting entitled Blast Furnace, 
in which he pictured the mid-sec-* 
tion of a blast furnace and its 
working units.
Professor Readio was among the 
early winners of the First Prize 
offered by the Associated Artists, 
having been so honored in 1921.
Mr. Riggs had the distinction of 
capturing two of the prizes offered 
this year, his oil painting, Farfn, 
Washington County winning the 
Art Society Prize, and his water 
color entitled, Brittany Fishing 
Village, receiving the Associated 
Artists Third Prize.
