Student Council Debates 
Salary of Treasurer
Defense Plan
Definite Decision 
Not Reached Despite 
Heated Discussion
See Editorial on page 2
After a lively forty-five minute 
discussion, Student Council could 
reach, no decision concerning the 
salary of Jim McGarvey, treasur
er of Student Council. Since the 
debate had reached a deadlock, the 
motion to approve Mr. McGarveys 
salary was tabled until tonight 
when it is to be voted upon.
Mr. Cullen started the discus
sion by asking for a report on the 
duties of the treasurer and the 
time spent in executing these 
duties. Mr. McGarvey explained 
that he must help with the bud
gets of the various organizations, 
approve and sign all checks, and 
train the assistant treasurers in 
their duties. He concluded his re
port by saying that his duties were 
.plainly stated in the Constitution.
A discussion followed in which 
Mr. Sions stated that; since offic
ers of all the other organizations 
on campus, such as Intersorority 
Council president, etc., do not re
ceive salaries, the officers of Stu
dent Council should not feel they 
must be paid. Mr. McGarvey an
swered him by stating that he 
spent over twenty hours a week 
performing his duties. Mr. Cullen 
claimed that his duties required 
no more than ten hours.
In the debate that followed sev
eral pertinent facts were brought 
out: first, that Mr. McGarvey had 
a verbal contract with last years 
Student Council for his salary of 
$500.00 which Mr. Cullen disput
ed since he felt that last years 
Council had no right to make a 
. contract for ..this, yeai'.s Council; 
second, that appropriations for 
other organizations had been cut 
as an economy measure, and 
therefore Student Council officers 
should be willing to accept a cut, 
too; and third, that until Council 
approved the treasurers salary, 
Mr. McGarvey could not legally 
receive his salary.
Since so many arguments had 
been brought out in the course of 
the discussion, Mr; Heilman felt 
that the motion should be tabled 
for another week, until everyone 
had a chance to think the matter 
over and come to a decision. 
Therefore, tonight at 7:30, the 
matter will be opened again and 
voted upon by the Council.
Includes Six 
Local Colleges
Mr. Beatty, head of Carnegies 
Industrial- Relations Bureau, has 
been made regional advisor for 
Western Pennsylvania, West Vir
ginia and Western Maryland in 
the nations gigantic engineering 
training program. Plans for the 
immediate and intensive training 
of industrial defense personnel 
are being hurried toward comple
tion by the six engineering col
leges in this district.
Aided by an allotment of $9,-
000,000 recently voted by Con
gress in the 
Sup plementary 
Defense Appro
priation Act, 
more than 5,000 
students will 
receive instruc
tion in techn i c a 1 defense 
work. Courses 
will be offered 
to both college 
students and 
men who at 
present are em
ployed. At first, however, prefer
ence will be shown to non-college 
youth. Under this set-up the stu
dents will pay no tuition
Taking a sampling from a num
ber of manufacturing concerns, in
cluding about 150,000 wage earn
ers, Mr. Beatty discovered that 
skilled workers were needed with 
a thorough knowledge of: Draft
ing and Design; Physical Metal
lurgy, Inspection and Testing, 
Piduction Engineering- and .Pro
duction Inspection. Therefore 
courses will be offered in these 
subjects principally. The instruc
tion will be of college gradere
quiring at least a high-school ed
ucation  but will concentrate 
upon immediate practical applica tion to scientific defense jobs. 
Two to eight months study will 
be required, and classes are to be 
held both at the engineering 
schools and in the various indus
trial plants. Regular college fac
ulties will be supplemented by ad
ditional teachers and specially 
qualified men from the industries 
to be served.

Exclusive Interview
Beveridge Webster Suggests 
Overshoes to Tartan Reporter
By Mercedes Cunningham
You know you really should 
wear overshoes in weather like 
this, said Beveridge Webster, 
Pittsburgh born pianist, as we left 
his home Friday afternoon amid 
srow flurries and sleet. And in the 
same, friendly, unassuming way 
he told about his years of study, 
his concerts, and his ideas.
This is a busy season for Mr. 
Webster as he has given ten con
certs in the last few weeks. He 
has just come from Philadelphia 
where he was guest soloist in a 
unique program for the Philadel
phia Symphony. This orchestra 
gave its first broadcast which was 
an exact reproduction of its first 
concert forty years ago with Gabrilowitch as the pianist.
When we asked him how he 
thought musical education in Am
erica compared with that in Eur
ope before the war, he' said that 
there was probably only one ma
jor difference. Europeans regard 
a boy studying music, and making 
it his lifetime profession, in a 
much more normal light than Am
ericans do. But recognition de
pends upon talent, regardless of 
the country from which it comes.
Mr. Webster stressed the idea 
.that an early start is necessary to 
specialize in music, for time-conservation is very important to this 
profession. To the question, Do 
your tastes lean toward classical 
or modern composers? he said he 
didnt believe in making distinc
tions, but he does think it is very
hard to pick out the choice compo
sitions in modern music.
, As far as practicing is con
cerned; Mr. Webster told us he 
practices from three to seven
hours every day. And when we 
asked him how long it took him 
tu learn the Tschaikowsky Con
certo he played with the Pitts
burgh Symphony last week, he 
amazed us when he said he had 
memorized it in five days when 
he was ten years old, but that it 
took him considerably longer to 
learn it. Incidentally, in the draw
ing room in which we interviewed 
him was the piano he used at 
the start of his career.
Lucky Who!
Fraternity Mol) 
Miss First Show
Publicity gags at times turn 
press notices into obituaries. Take 
last Thursday evening, for in
stance. Ten fellows from each Pitt 
and Tech fraternity were guests 
o', the Harris-Alvin Management 
at the first public showing of Too 
Many Girls in Pittsburgh.
Sprucing up a bitshining ones 
shoes, slicking down the hair and 
donning a clean shirtthe mob 
gathered at the Alvin a little be
fore 7:00. Promptly at seven they 
started to stroll in; at: the doOr, 
however, an usher told them to 
wait. They waited and waited and 
waited, but no show. At 7:30 the 
manager came out from hiding 
and told them there had been a 
slight accident in the theater. 
C< nsequently, they would have to 
go to the Senator to see another 
picturea double feature.
The boys are in a huddle; now 
theyre coming out of it and up 
to the line of scrimmage. Sudden
ly they break into a bull rush; 
brandishing sticks and banners 
they run through the streets like 
a thundering horde, yelling, Rev
olution. Comes de Revolution/ 
Woe to the unfortunate pedestrian 
who was in the way; he simply 
didnt stand a chance. Courtesy 
had no voicefun was in order, 
and did they have fun!
Reaching the Senator, they 
quietly (imagine how quiet a 
hundred Tech fraternity men are) 
took their seats. At the end of the 
evening, the gentlemen quietly 
left the theater, right in the mid
dle of a funny scenethey cer-f 
tainly killed that laugh line. j
Outside of the theater, the^ 
were interviewed and pictured 
-were taken. Surprised at this sudl, 
den turn, of events,, they askeahow come?*
Well ... It seems that a section 
of the roof of the Alvin had fallen 
down on the seats which had been 
reserved for them 15 minutes be
fore they had arrived. Whos lucky 
now?

Social! Work Dept. 
Offers Courses 
In State Hospital
Arrangements have been com
pleted with the Warren State Hos
pital, Warren, Pennsylvania, which 
will enable selected second-year 
graduate students in the Depart
ment of Social Work lo secure 
field-work practice in the Social 
Service Department of the hos
pital.
The hospital Is offering two 
maintenance scholarships to stu
dents who will begin their field
work assignment in June of 1941, 
and will remain In residence until 
the early part of December, by 
which time they will have com
pleted .the degree requirements In 
advanced field work. During the 
first semester the students will at
tend a class in Methods of Social 
Research and will have confer
ences on the campus on the Mon
days of alternate weeks, but the 
remainder of their time will be 
spent at the hospital where in ad
dition to case work they will col
lect the data for a research proj
ect. They will spend full time 
cn the campus during the second 
semester completing the research 
project and required courses.

Council Minutes Plus
With this,issue Hie TARTAN is undertaking; to perform a 
florvice which it has neglected for some time. It will attempt to 
report factually and without bias, but as completely as possible, 
every meeting oif student council.
Until now the TARTAN has reported Student Council meet
ings almost solely by printing the minutes of! those gatherings. 
This was done on the mistaken assumption that the minutes would 
1)0 present the most unbiased and complete account of what took 
place. We soon found that no minutes can give a complete piciurc of the events they record. The fault lies, not with the sec
retary, but with the nature oi! a list of motions which of neccssily must omit a great deal of background. The background 
of these motions is as important as the decisions themselves to the 
understanding of someone who was not present at the meeting.
TARTAN coverage of Student Council will not confine itself 
to minutes. It will attempt to paint as complete a picture as 
possible. It will attempt to put into the hands of every student 
the information without which he cannot be an intelligent and 
informed citizen of the campus. That means that we will stick 
to facts, but wc will pull no punches.
In order to permit all sides in a Student Council to have their 
arguments considered by the student body, the TARTAN offers 
to print any statements members of council wish to make on any 
question now being considered or which may be considered in the 
future. The only: restrictions upon these statements is that they 
be reasonably short and that they be signed by some member or 
members of Council.
The purpose of the TARTAN is to serve the best interests of 
the student body and not the narrow interests of any group. Re
porting of Council meetings is not intended to vindicate one 
group or embarrass another. It is intended to give the campus 
citizen as much knowledge as possible of what the members of 
his legislature are ctejmg.

quired about the value of these 
tests, we herewith publish their 
uses; they are used as a basis for 
sectioning large classes into 
groups of more homogeneous abil
ity; as a factor to be considered 
in granting financial aid, either 
cn scholarships or loans; as a 
means of estimating students ef
fort as shown by high rates and 
low marks; and as one element in 
offering advice to the student on 
the choice of his college course 
or vocation.
In addition to these uses, the 
tests are valuable when giving ad
vice to students on courses and 
the hours he should spend study
ing; as a means of judging fail
ing students and students on pro
bation; as one element to bo con
sidered in student employment, 
both for judging the type of work 
a student can do, and for judging 
the amount of work he can carry.
These tests, from 1916 until 
1939, were given under the direc
tion of the Department of Psy
chology and Education, but, this 
year, for the first time, they were 
handled by the Bureau of Mea
surement and Guidance. The de
tails of this Bureau, which was 
newly created this year, will be 
given in the TARTAN next week.

Are you interested in knowing 
where your friends eat after the 
movies? Do you know what the
aters they go to when they do 
go? At what stores do most Car
negie students shop? Come to the 
TARTAN office tomorrow at 4:30 
if youd like to help us find out 
these and many more tempting 
items.
A new deparlmenx is being set 
up on the staffthat of Merchan
dising Surveys. Quite a fancy 
name, but the work of this group 
will be just as interesting.
Firstthey will collaborate and 
cogitate until they evolve a list 
of surveys that can be made. This 
list would include questions on 
such topics as those already men
tioned.
Secondthey will formulate the 
specific questions to be asked. Such 
things as where, why, when and 
with whom, will come under this 
heading.
Thirdthey will conduct the 
actual survey, asking the questions 
of the students at various time in 
popular informal spots around 
campus.
Fourththey will interpret the 
results and answersthat isthey 
will find out by actual count where 
Techites go for their spaghetti, 
and why they go there, and how 
often.

Brain Teaser
As a relief from the rather 
heavy problems offered in the last 
few weeks, something trivial may 
be appreciated. It is estimated 
that the genius should get this 
weeks puzzler in 0.93 plus or 
minus 0.06 seconds; the ordinary 
mortal will require about 5 sec
onds, and the imbecile, not more 
than 15 seconds. The writer, in
cidentally, got it in 3 seconds flat. 
Here it is:
Twenty pairs of red socks and 
twenty pairs of blue socks were 
laid out on a bargain counter at 
9:00 A. M. one morning. After 
thirty minutes had passed, bargain-hunters had so, thoroughly 
ransacked the pile that every sock 
was separated from its mate and 
all were distributed at random; 
no socks had as yet been pur
chased, however. At this time a 
woman wearing dark glasses came 
up to the counter and began taking 
socks, one after another, without 
being able to tell what color she 
was taking. How many socks 
would she have to take, in order 
to be absolutely certain that she 
had at least two of the same color?

High-Voltage
Artificial Lightning 
Will Be Tested
Did you ever hear of an im
pulse generator or a cathode ray 
cs.cillograph? Both of these com
plicated gadgets may be found in 
Machinery Hall.
The impulse generator, designed 
two years ago by David Pinker
ton, a graduate student of Tech, 
generates bolts of man-made 
lightning which are shot at pieces 
of insulation to test them. Edward 
R. Rice, another graduate student, 
designed the cathode ray oscillo
graph which shows what happens 
during the discharge. Needless to 
say, the oscillograph has to be 
right on the job during the bolt 
if it is going to give an accurate 
picture of what happened. Have 
you ever tried to examine a bolt 
oi lightning?
It takes a very high degree of 
vacuum in the oscillograph to 
make an accurate record. Ordin
ary vacuum pumps arent good 
enough, so in the past the thing 
hasnt worked very well.
Last week a new Langmuir-type 
condensation pump arrived from 
the General Electric Co. This 
pump is being adapted to the os
cillograph and all tests seem to 
indicate that it is going to work. 
According to Dr. Work, head of 
the E. E. department, some in
teresting results will come from 
the high-voltage laboratory short

Dancing Lessons
A couple from the Chaliff School 
of dancing, Rockefeller Center, 
New York, will be one of the at
tractions at the next dancing class, 
IF there is a next class. There 
might not( be one for the simple 
reason that unless 100 people sign 
up within the next two weeks, the 
dancing class will not materialize.
The lessons will include the 
rhumba, conga, fox trot and waltz 
as well as the more elementary 
steps. The price of each lesson is 
50c. For further information con
sult Miss Kanrich or Mary Bovv

By Ruth Brodie
You probably wont believe this, but wave found somebocly with the same horrible sense of humor we haveor 
maybe even more horrible. We feel that the student body 
shouldnt be denied this, so were lending him to you for the 
remainder of this column. Without further shilly-shally, we 
give you the irrepressiblewe might almost say uncontroll
able'Garry Davis!RB.
For anyone to say that he or she (God help them) has a 
sense of lmmor more horrible than Ruth Brodie is like trying 
1o fight Joe Louis with powder puffs at fifty paces. Figure that 
one out, Bud. However, I will proceed.
Ever since I can remember, there has been a word in the 
English language that has been quite puzzling to me. This is 
shilly-shally. I heard it first way back when Mother was still 
saying, Garry, dont squeeze the goldfish, it makes the ejres 
bulge. (Which is slightly ambiguous.) I was playing marbles 
with some of the Twelfth Street Phantoms, a name concocted by 
one Slapsy McDougal, the local bon vivant. After I had 
made what I considered was a particularly brilliant shotknock
ing out four aggies with a difficult dobbie twistone of the boys 
said rather curtly, Iiey, you shilly-shallied, whereupon six 
Phantoms jumped on me while the seventh whistled for the rest 
of the gang. To this day I dont know what I did to warrant be
ing a punching-bag for fourteen weaving Phantoms. Goodness 
knows, I hope I never shilly-shally again.
A column is usually a long, straight, standing-up thing, 
which is either round or square. Of course, it is sometimes five
sided or six-sided or seven-sided (or eight-sided, sometimes) but 
and this but looms like a mountain on the horizonwhy 
does a column not have nine sides, sometimes? Whats wrong 
with nine sides? You might think that people who designed col
umns were prejudiced against the number nine. I have gone 
out of my way many times to see whether they have ever given 
in. Why, I even went to Mustard Falls, Ya., where I heard a 
rumor of a nine-sided job, but no, always eight at' the most. 
Grrrto end this particular thesis on nine-sided columns, or 
how I imitate the four Hawaiians, I would like to state that 
when I move into my little private Utopia, all my houses will be 
built of nine-sided columns, including the chicken coop, so there.
Some one gave me a letter the other dayin fact, five days 
agowith the implicit instructions to mail it immediately. As 
I was passing a mail-box on my way, I said Id be glad to; sure 
thing; trust me. (All this with a swagger.) But believe me, if 
there is anything that can fade from the mind faster than mailing 
someone elses letters, its mailing ones own. No sooner was I 
out of the Irouse than it faded, but' fast. Now here it is five days 
later, and I am still the trusted possessor. (I accidentally put 
my hand in my pocket for an old cigar that I thought I mislaid, 
and there was the letter.) Needless to say, it; is -yvas a terrifying 
problem. What shall I do? A letter mailed five days late can 
do horrible things. For instance, Cousin Moc might be waiting 
at this very minute down at Moose River Junction for a person 
that will never arrive. Suppose winter comes along, as it always 
does, and Cousin Moe freezes, what then? No, I think Ill forget 
the whole thing and pretend the letter got lost in the mail It 
sometimes happens, you know. And anyway, what difference 
does five measly days make when you think how long .it takes 
light from the stars to reach us. Wliew!

directed by Douglas McLean of 
the Drama School. The play de
picts two incidents of Brashears 
life.
John Brashear, born in Novem
ber 1840, started life as a millworker. For twenty-one years he 
stuck to his trade, but he also 
kept right on studying the stars. 
After years of study, none of 
which was formal, he emerged as 
a famous astronomer and maker 
of astronomical instruments. He 
soon became widely known for his 
wisdom, civic undertakings, and 
philanthropic projects.
After Andrew Carnegie had de
cided to provide funds for a tech
nical school, the Board of Trus
tees of the Carnegie Institute se
cured Brashear as a member of 
the planning and building commit
tee. After its opening, Brashear 
became a member of the first 
Board of Trustees.
There is an interesting story 
connected with Brashears por
trait hanging on the left wall of 
Administration Hall.
In 1905 Robert C. Hall of Pitts
burgh, commissioned a Polish ar
tist to execute a painting of 
Brashear. It was to hang in the 
Brashear home during the life
time of Mrs. Brashear, and upon 
her death was to be transferred to 
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
When those persons who had 
knowledge of the arrangements 
died, the oil portrait was forgot
ten, and it was not until 1934 that

On November 25th, the thirtyfourth annual Christmas Seal Sale, 
sponsored by the Tuberculosis 
League of Pittsburgh, will start. 
This local branch of the National 
League has a $100,000 quota.
This commendable drive , was 
started by Emily P. Bissell in an 
attempt to raise some money for 
the Wilmington tuberculosis sanitorium. From 1910 to 1920 the Red 
Cross aided the National Tuber
culosis Association, which carried 
on alone from then on. This year 
they are to raise $5,000,000. It is 
a drive worthy of the support of 
every American citizen.

Tech Re-enters Win 
Column In Victory 
Over Diplomats
IVluha Dashes 72 
Seconds of First 
Win First Road
Carnegie Techs football squad 
bounced back into the win col
umn last Saturday at Lancaster 
by defeating a better than average 
Franklin and Marshall team by a 
score of 18-6. The victory was a 
matter of seconds as Galloping 
George Muha carried the mail on a 
,72 yard sprint to a score in the last 
few seconds of the first half. The 
teams were quite evenly matched, 
each having several of their stars 
on the casualty list, but Tech 
emerged from the contest the vic
tor flue to superior playing in the 
second half of the game.
The turning point of the game 
which put new life into the Tar
tans was Muhas long dash mid
way in the game. The Diplomats 
were never the same after this 
and George continued to rip 
through their line for many sub
stantial gains. The Muha of 
1930 seemed to come back to the 
Tech team and was the spark that 
touched off the winning spirit lying semi-dormant in the Tartan 
squad.
Dr. Eddie Baker started his sec. ohd team,and they did well for the 
first few minutes but fumbled on 
the Tech 46 and the Diplomats re
covered: At this time the stage
was set for the only score that 
the home team made. Sophomore

.first game for F & M, began to 
pitch passes. Two passes netted 
eighteen yards and also the Tech 
first team. But the Diplomats 
were hot and scored on the next 
play on a sixteen yard pass that 
Tech never had a chance to knock 
down. Then AJex SchibanoiT 
missed his first kick in three years 
of college football.
From this point on the game de
veloped into a punting duel until

the last few minutes of the half. 
Jordano passed to Fisher for 23 
yards and then to Muha.for a first 
down on the 15. The attack bog
ged down-here and F & M took 
possession of the ball. One pass 
and Chang Dunns interception set 
up Muhas touchdown run. Kuenzli 
was hurt on the interception, a 
nerve in his shoulder, and the fact 
that .time was called saved the last 
few seconds for one more play. 
Muha faded back to pass, but 
when he couldnt locate a receiver 
he started on his jaunt that led 
to paydirt for the Skibo cause 
as the half ended.
This touchdown changed the 
entire aspect or the game to one 
that was all Tech. In the third 
period Muha again scored from 
the six yard line, culminating a 
43 yard march; in the final frame, 
Jordano banged into the line for 
the final yard of a 57 yard drive. 
Leading up to the second score, 
Jordano passed to Cletus Fisher

turned a punt to the Tech 49 and 
tlie touchdown march was on. A 
sustained drive with all the backs 
carrying the ball and including a 
15 yard holding penalty, led to 
the final score of the day for

Bethany Wallops Tech 
In Last Meet of Year
Harriets Win.In 
Unofficial Meet
In their last meet of the season 
against Bethany the Tech harriers 
came closer to victory than they 
have in any meet this season. The 
score was 23 to 32. Morgan of 
Bethany finished first ,and Teresi, 
Techs captain, came in next with 
Marcin close behind. Morgans 
time was 25:38, Teresi finished in 
26:10, and Marcins time was 26:24. 
If Tech could have placed three 
men in the first five to finish the 
team could have won. At any 
rate the squad has shown steady 
improvement all during the season 
this year.
Following is a list of boys who 
will receive sweaters and a tabula
tion of where they placed in the 
various meets:

In order to win a sweater a run
ner must place in at least two 
meets. This means that he must 
finish fifth or before as far as his 
own team is concerned.
Indicative of the spirit the Tech 
squad has shown throughout this 
season is the fact that several of 
the members of the team accepted 
a challenge from the Jeannette 
team. They did this entirely of 
their own accord on Saturday 
morning. Tech won over the high 
school team by a score of 25% to 
29%, the tie being made by Sarantopolis of Tech and Dobroski.
Although Tech has lost all her 
meets this season, the team has 
shown much spirit and progress. 
This together with the fact that 
the Freshman- team has shown 
great promise leads us to hope for a 
more successful season next year.

Plebe Soccer Tearn 
Drops Third Game 
Of Season, 3-0
The Tartan booters journeyed to 
Lancaster, Pa., last Saturday 
morning to play Franklin and 
Marshall in a game which the 
Diplomats won by the one-sided 
score of 6-1. The defeat was the 
fourth consecutive one the fourth 
this year. The field was in excel
lent playing condition but a cold 
and bitter wind handicapped both 
sides considerably. The Diplo
mats had a field day in the first 
quarter, when they scored four of 
their six points, the other two 
came in the second and fourth 
quarters. The Skibos only score 
was registered in the first period 
by Viviana. The outstanding Tar
tan players were Crooks, Rhodes, 
and Viviana.
The Tartans are host to Oberlin 
next Saturday morning and all 
students are invited to attend and 
root for a Skibo victory.
The freshman soccer squad lost 
their third game of the season last 
Thursday afternoon when the 
Western Pennsylvania School for 
the Deaf defeated them 3-0 at 
Butler, Pa. The victors have 
been classed as experts at the 
game soccer for many years. Two 
of; the points were scored in the 
second quarter and the third one 
came in the third quarter.
The freshman  soccer squad has 
just completed their season with
out a victory but nevertheless 
there are many good players, on 
the team and the prospepts. for. 
an ex^llent varsity squad next

WHAT A MAN in a bowling alley! He was the "boy 
wonder a dccade ago. Today, with a long list of na

just how lie gets such pin-blasting power and such hair

No question, though, how Joe Norris gets the extras in 
his cigarette. He turned to the slower-burning brand... 
Camel... for extra mildness and found several other 
pleasing extras as well, including extra smoking.
Slower burning...costlier tobaccoswhat pleasure 
they can add to smoking! More mildness and coolness 
because Camels are free from the irritating effects of 
too-fast burning. More flavor because slow burning 
lets the flavor come through. And along with extra

THIS IS the "Fireball. Joe Norris {above) uses U

And theres nothing like a Camel for flavor.
In recent laboratory tests, Camels burned

Burch Leads Squad 
In Place of Stark
On December 10, 1940, in the 
Carnegie Tech gymnasium, the 
proteges of Max Hannum will 
open the fall basketball season 
against Waynesburg College. This 
game with a school which always 
boasts a fine offensive aggregation 
will provide the local fans their 
first opportunity to see the Skibo 
Hoopsters in action.
For the last four weeks the 
aspirants for varsity positions on 
the team have been practicing dil
igently every afternoon. Although 
the loss of last years captain, Bob 
Stark, and spunky Jimmy Tumpane was noticeable at the first 
practice sessions, promising for
wards and guards from past second 
team squads have ably filled the 
vacancies. It would be nearly im
possible at this time to predict just 
who will amass the most points 
during the season, or who will 
prove to be the most valuable 
player; rather it would be more 
correct to say that the teams 
greatest asset will be its ability 
to absorb the best performances of 
each individual player to the end 
of developing a type of team play
that will worry any opponent. This 
play will be the result of very fine 
passing, splendid coordination of 
blocks and cuts, and, in the main, 
on the speed and elusiveness of 
th e component players in the ma
chine.
A great deal of the play will 
probably be sparked by Captain' 
Red Burch, who, in past perform
ances, has shown the fans his 
ability as a tricky and speedy 
actor. Tall, cool-headed, and vet
eran might best describe Itch 
Hennessy, one of the nicest ballhandlers on the squad. In their 
plugging at all times will be the 
Patton boys, Kermit and Wally. 
Kermit, who, incidentally, gradu
ates in February, undoubtedly has 
the most experience of the two, 
but lanky Wally, a newcomer from 
last years freshman team, has 
shown possibilities as first team 
ccnter. Brinn, Fisher, LePage, 
Niederberger, and Smith, two of 
them new to the varsity, and_three 
with the varying experience, com
plete a squad that is going to be 
tough to beat.
There is one marked difference 
between your Tartan team and 
the ones who will oppose it dur
ing the season; not one player on

Carnegie Tech Freshman Football Squad
THE GLORIOUS THIRD
"= By Bill Floyd, Sports Editor ..........- 
Win Number Three
For the third time this season the gridiron veterans oil our 
school chalked np a victory. Although the general tendency is 
to pass off this win as a minor achievement it is by no means a 
hit and run accomplishment. The pre-game clopesters from the 
happy town of Lancaster felt so confident as to their team s pos
sibilities that they were wagering large sums and giving high odds 
to all takers.
The high water mark in the Diplomats defeat came with only 
a few seconds remaining in the first half. At this moment Big 
George Muha uncorked his now famous 72-yard gallop. The 
downtown papers list this play as a fluke stating that Master 
Muha being trapped on an attempted pass play started to run, 
and with the help of some ten startled Tartans ran down the field 
unhindered. The true picture of what happened is entirely differ
ent, for the play (a new brain child of the good Doctor) was well 
planned and beautifully executed. Starting from a punt forma
tion the opposing linemen are permitted to sift through the 
Skibos first line of defenseBig George, putting on an act that 
would put many a good Dramat to shame pretending he is trap
ped, looks hopefully down the field for an eligible receiver; having 
fooled the entire force of the enemy he suddenly tucks the ball 
under his arm and circles an end behind the interference of ten 
supposedly entirety- confused Tartan blockers. It worked and 
worked beautifully, what more need be said?
Frankie Enters Game
One of the startling features of the game was the appearance 
of Frank Jordano as an active participant in this past contest. 
On a college squad bolstered by adequate reserves, any man in 
Franks game time condition would never have entered the game. 
However, despite the paraffin cast needed to support' the arch 
of his foot Frankie was the ace pass pitcher of the day. Over 
and above his aerial achievements Iiappy Hank managed to limp 
a few yards over the scrimmage line 011 each running play he at
tempted.
Hockey To Be Continued
Buddy Overend has just announced that again during the 
1940-41 season Carnegie Tech is to support a varsity hockey team. 
At the present time negotiations are under way to schedule games 
with some of the Cleveland schools that were met last season, and, 
in addition, to book games with some of the Eastern Pennsylvania 
schools such as Penn State and Lehigh.
The varsity squad of some 23 skaters have already begun 
practice, and are steejing themselves for the grueling season to 
come.

Editors NoteThis is the first in 
a series of articles printed in order 
to create a more interesting sports 
page.
There is one thing that makes 
football so interesting and that is 
the fact that as time goes 011 each 
season is screwier than the one 
preceeding it. This year is no ex
ception. All the prophets pick the 
teams that must come out on top 
when the final game has been play
ed, but those "teams seem to meet 
the jinx and go down to a not-soglorious defeat. If you recall a cer
tain game a few Saturdays ago a 
certain aggregation from Pittsburgh 
lost to a South Bend eleven to the 
tune of 61 to zero. But coming 
from a mediocre season to meet 
thfc situation was the Iowa team. 
They duplicated their act of last 
year by upsetting the highly 
vaunted Notre Dame throng 7 to 0. 
Iowa had lost 4 and won 2 games 
before last Saturdays game. Dr. 
Eddie Anderson, coach of Iowa 
and former Notre Dame player, 
scouted his Alma. Maters team 
and knew exactly what would be 
done and when it would be done. 
Consequently Notre Dame was 
stymied and couldnt come through 
with the punch needed.
clicking again, picking up steady 
yardage around the ends and 
through the tackles, ably aided 
by hard line smashes by Bill 
Philipchuk. A fast-breaking pass 
play gave the Skibos a first down 
on the Presidents two yard line 
and set them up for what appear
ed to be a certain touchdown, 
but before another play could be 
run off the final gun barked and 
the contest was over with the Tar
tans on the long end of a 12-6 
Techmen hung up their second 
count.
About the closest contests are 
the games played in the Big Ten. 
Several games have been won by 
a bare margin of one or two points. 
Such was the case with the Michigan-Minnesota fray also the Min
nesota-Northwestern battle. Then 
to. carry out my idea, this same 
Michigan juggernaut pummelled 
Northwestern, 20-13.
In the East there has been a 
great amount of fine playing. The 
only type of scoring that did not 
take place in the Boston CollegeGeorgetown game was a forfeit 
(one point). Touchdowns, extra 
points, a safety, a field goal all 
added up to give a final score of 
19-18 in favor of the boys from 
Boston. Cornell had a terrific 
time beating Dartmouth. It is 
said that Cornell needed 59 min
utes and 55 seconds of playing 
time and an extra down to shove 
over the score that snatchcd a 
win from the Indians.
Penn State has been doing 0 
fine job this season. They are 
still in the undefeated daks but 
there is a tie chalked up against 
them against Syracuse. Pitt lost 
a tough one to the Cornhuskers of 
Nebraska, 9-7. The Panthers have 
been growing in strength as the 
year is progressing.
Penn State will try to remain 
in the winning column next week 
at which time they meet Pitt. The 
one thing that makes a success 
of any State team is a win over 
Pitt. This year their chances are 
good, what with one of the better 
teams representing State taking 
the field next Saturday. The game 
between Michigan and Ohio State 
should be a killer. Ill take Mich
igan with Harmon crossing the 
double-chalk line at least once.
Look for the Igloo!

Displaying a fine running attack

Tartan Frosh football squad reg
istered an impressive 12-6 victory

Capitalizing on a blocked punt by 
Buck Jones, Skibo right end, the

Cantini flew 30 yards through the 
snow flakes into the arms of A1

the extra point by Captain John 
Lindberg was low.
In the third quarter the Scots 
staged a sustained drive with* 
Reed and Cantini alternating 011 
off-tackle smashes and end runs. 
The attack almost bogged down on 
the 11 yard line when the alert 
W & J secondary broke up two
the Skibo squad is receiving fi

team deserves support from the 
student is evident to even the most 
uninterested of you.
Letter to the Sports Editor 
Dear Sports-Editor:
In the football season which is 
now drawing to a close there have 
been heartaches, groans and re
criminations. Everyone blamed 
everyone else for lack of schoolspirit, lack of good reserves on the 
team; and just for lack of some
thing better to do. But none ever 
thought to commend the boys who 
were out there plugging even they 
had no chance to win. We cer
tainly owe it to them, no matter 
what our record of wins or losses 
has been, to show some apprecia
tion for their grit and persever
ance, on the field on Saturdays, 
and on the campus Mondays after 
a game.
So we, the Amalgamated Foot
ball Worshippers of America, wish 
to offer our thanks to the boys and 
to tell them that no matter what 
happens, well be in the bleachers 
rooting, whenever Saturday rolls 
around.
B. J. X., Secretary.

INCOMING
JAMES C. FISHER
James C. Fisher is back in an 
office where he is experienced. 
When he was elected as Council 
President last April, he had no 
misgivings regarding his ability to 
hold this weighty post, as he was 
President of the 1938-39 Council, 
and he made a grand success of 
it. He was first elected to office 
from the Engineering College in 
1937. Incidentally this is the 
third consecutive year than an En
gineer has been voted President of 
the Council.
Jim came to Carnegie Tech 
mainly to study Mechanical Engi
neering but partly to carry on tra
dition as his father is a graduate 
of the Engineering College, and 
Jim is mighty proud of the fact. 
In June, 1939, Jim received a Cert.iicate and his goal of a degree 
now looms pleasantly on the hori
zon.
A quiet but determined manner 
aids Jim in disposing of the diffi
cult tasks that .confront the pres
ident of the governing body of the 
Evening School. He is sincere 
and courteous, and is interested in 
everything that demands the use 
of his intellect. The duties of his 
office will not be viewed lightly by 
Jim.
New Kensington boasts of him 
as one of the towns most prom
ising young citizens. Ilis employ
ment is in the Engineering De
partment of the Aluminum Com
pany. Ho finds relaxation in cur
rent movies, football, baseball, and 
hockey games in season, and he 
plays tennis well.
The new president is of medium 
height, has a dark complexion, and 
he keeps slim by eating heartily 
and often.
Among other admirable facul
ties possessed by Jim is that of 
seeing two sides to every ques
tion and giving lull consideration 
to the value of each side.
.7im is not exactly footloose, and 
the attractive little girl who ac
companies him to the dances is 
the cause of the serious ideas 
which lie entertains these days.
Look for the Igloo!

Thanksgiving Recess 
Set Back One Week
The date for Thanksgiving in 
Pennsylvania has been changed 
again. Instead of celebrating it on 
November 21, as was set last year 
by President Roosevelt, we Penn
sylvanians will sit down to our 
Thanksgiving dinners on Novem
ber 28, as set by a proclamation 
of Governor James.
Because of this the Thanksgiv
ing recess has been changed to a 
week later than listed in the of
ficial calendar as published in the 
handbook. Instead of beginning 
Thursday, November 21 and end
ing Saturday, November 23, 
Thanksgiving recess will begin 
Tnursday, November 28 and end 
Saturday, November 30. So re
member no classes on these days. 
We can put our books away and 
fcrget them for three days. The 
only toll that we must pay is to 
do without the Plaid for one 
issue.
1 o the Editor:
It all began last Friday evening. 
Ihe article Dontdress up ladies 
in last weeks Plaid was a bomb
shell. You see it was this way. I 
invited Liz to the Arts Dance last 
Saturday (Liz is my best and only 
girl) and before I had placed the 
period on the sentence she says, 
No, with emphasis.
Why, says I.
Because I cant wear my new 
evening gown, says she. The 
article in the paper doesnt ap
prove.
I read that article and thought 
it was some sort of a joke never 
thinking it would apply to my Liz. 
Gee, she looks real swell in one 
of those floor line models (with a 
jacket so she doesnt catch cold) 
and when we attend those dances 
it is the only occasion she has to 
dress up meantime to show her 
loveliness. We always have so 
much fun dancing at Thistle Hall. 
I suggested she wear her blue 
gown anyhow. But when I called 
for her Saturday evening, she was 
wearing her street clothes and 
re used to spend the evening danc
ing. After a few arguments, I 
gave up and we went to the local 
cinema and held hands.
Now why cant girls dress up? 
We men enjoy seeing our ladies in 
dressmakers creations. All day we 
see ordinary street clothes and it 
does a man a world of good to 
feel lovely femininity instead of
music. And this is not the end of 
his artistic inclinations. He fills 
leisure moments with planning 
modern homes, and in addition to 
driving and dancing, he sings, de
signs his own Christmas cards and 
plays golf as it should be played. 
Ir this sport he is undoubtedly 
chnmpionship-calibre.
He works in the Control Engin
eering Department of Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing 
Company, East Pittsburgh. His 
greatest talent is that of making 
friends and retaining them.
Steve is over 6 feet in height, 
weighs 199 pounds, is soft spoken, 
has decidedly cultural tastes and 
in general, girls, he is without 
doubt an "eligible man from all 
points of view.

AN ENGINEER.
Last years Plaid carried two 
articles relative to dance attire. 
One was written by the fairer sex, 
encouraging long di*bsses, the oth
er was written by a fellow who 
thought he knew how girls should 
cuess, discouraging long dresses, 
because he usually waited until 
Saturday evening to get his date 
and never gave a girl time to 
dress her best.
After having missed only two 
dances during the last three years 
and only a few in the four years 
t v- , to f^at. Jve ceen a change 
taking place in the quality of 
night school dances held at Tech. 
No, its not for the better. On the 
contrary what once used to be the 
finest dances in the Pittsburgh dis
trict, barring none, are now turn
ing into the common routine thing 
that gives no more of a thrill than 
one gets from seeing an airplane. 
Why? Heres the answer.
Until last year a great number 
of girls came in long dresses, othei s came in sport dresses. The 
average was about even. The situ
ation was such that regardless of 
whether a girl came in a long 
dress or short dress, she never had 
to feel out of place. What she wore 
usually depended on the economy; 
she was still there to enjoy her
self. Girls enjoyed dressing-up 
then and still do. That is one trait 
in women that will never change. 
Nature intended it so.
When you attended a dance in 
those days, you really enjoyed it 
and you remembered it. Being just 
one of the male sex, I, like many 
others, enjoy seeing the fairer sex 
in all their sweet allure and beau
ty. Men wont change in this re
spect. They enjoy it when they 
can show-off their best gal in 
all her beauty and sweetness. It 
sure makes for a world of a dif
ferent atmosphere.
Some may stress economy. 
There are occasions when a girl 
has to buy a long di*ess for some 
special affair. If she never gets 
a chance to wear it again, what 
sort of economy is that. Then 
again, maybe she cant afford it.
Council To Hold

Retiring from office as President 
of the Evening Student Council 
1939-40, Stephen William Marcinizyn steps down in a blaze 
of glory.
A review of Steves career be
gins when he planned to be an 
architect and came to Carnegie 
for that purpose. His plans un
derwent a gradual but none the 
less definite change, and he de
veloped a real ambition to earn 
his degree in Mechanical Engin
eering.
In Council activities, Steve has 
held various posts. He was elect
ed treasurer of the College of En
gineering in 1937 and was select
ed that year as Council treasurer. 
Finding complete disorder in the 
Council books, it was Steves huge 
task to set up a comprehensive 
bookkeeping system, which he ac
complished . without any assist
ance. His accounts will be admir
ed by many subsequent Council 
treasurers in years to come. In the 
next year he was elected Presi
dent of the College and at the end 
of that year Steve found that he 
had been voted to that most covet
ed of all Council officesthat of 
Council President. He filled this 
office conscientiously and in a 
warm, friendly manner.
His character is unique. He real
ly enjoys studying, but studies 
best while listening to symphonic
Youve heard a great deal about 
Turkey Feathers lately and here

tunate to obtain the sweet music 
of Herman Middleman and his 
orchestra. Herman Middleman is 
well known in the Pittsburgh area. 
He has had extended engagements

played at The Yacht Club. Her

It is not the impossible that we 
seek. If we can get things back 
to where there is an even aver
age, so no one feels out of place, I 
for one will be very happy. After 
one gets  married, the picture 
changes, so lets have those by
gone days back. Lets be able to 
remember those happy-carefree 
days when romance and gaiety 
reigned. We men dont want the 
Stella Dallas dressed women; 
all we want is to see the fair sex 
in all its simple and tantalizing 
beauty. I alsp feel that when 
there comes a time that women 
are no longer attractive, no longer 
lovely, no longer the most beauti
ful creatures on earth, I want to 
join the Foreign Legion.
All in all, what we want are 
dances at Tech that you can real
ly look forward to and want to 
attend. We want them to be the 
finest dances held anywhere, so 
jome along girls dont disappoint 
us men folks. Encourage your girl 
friends to wear long dresses. Your 
effort will prove worthy.
A HOPEFUL MALE.
