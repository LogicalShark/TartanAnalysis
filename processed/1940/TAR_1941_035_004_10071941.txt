After four years of study and 
touring in Germany, Mr. Malcolm 
Hilty, one of Americas famous 
operatic tenors, has returned to his 
home in Pittsburgh. And again 
Carnegie Tech can claim a famous 
personage.
Although he was not a graduate 
of Tech, Mr. Hilty was a student 
here in the Music Department about 
fourteen years, ago. He acquired a 
scholarship to the ;
Juilliard Gradu
ate School of 
Music in New |
York, and studied 
there under|
Madam Anna 
Schoen - Rene.
After studying j 
under various i 
teachers and 
singing on the 
radio until 1937, 
he decided to go 
to Berlin to gain 
more experience. Vol.3l5 N4lCA
In Europe, Mr. Hilty studied un
der a Polish professor, giving many 
recitals in Berlin and taking part 
in various operas. He was in forty 
operatic performances all told, ten 
for each of four operasRienzi, 
Die Freischutz, Lohengrin, and 
Carmen.
About three months ago, Mr. 
Hilty had to move to the American 
Embassy in Berlin for protection. 
He decided that it would be best 
for him to leave for America, se
cured a pass from the Embassy, 
and took a plane to Lisbon. From 
here he took an American boat, the 
Excalibar, for home. By securing 
this pass in Europe he was able 
to leave without the usual custom 
examinations. Thus his luggage was. 
not opened, and the photographs of 
his various performances which reRep resentative 
Coming Today 
For Interviews
Techs student Employment Of
fice is busier than ever this year, 
for many calls for student work 
have not as yet been filled. The 
types of work range from selling 
on odd Saturdays to freight work 
and delivering. Students are asked 
to apply at the office at 246 In
dustries Building where they will 
be given a card of introduction to 
the companies which have called 
for workers.
Representatives of Kaufmanns 
Department .Store are coming here 
at 12:30 today to interview students 
interested in Saturday and Christ
mas work. Anyone who desires an 
interview should sign up before 
that time in the Employment 
Office.
Also it is requested that any Tech 
student who was employed during 
the summer report to the Office 
whether the job was obtained 
through the office or not. This is 
in case Tech may have been asked 
to send recommendations to em
ployers, and the records will aid in 
keeping the office in direct contact 
with the student body.
Today, October 7, is also the day 
N. Y. A., time cards are due, so 
dont forget to turn them in.

points should be given for work 
on the Cut if it is to be a recogniz
ed campus publication. He mov
ed that points be given to the peo
ple who work on the Cut. Mr. 
Durbin asked whether this pub
lication should he considered a ma
jor or a minor publication. Mr. 
Richardson asked the Points and 
Keys Committee to decide the 
status of the Cut, and to give a 
report at the next meeting. Mr. 
Shoffner withdrew his motion. Mr.

Motion carried.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Burton asked that Council 
make some corrections in the ByContinued 3G ToUI CO3
mained intact would have been re
turned to Berlin, if they had been 
discovered1.
Mr. Hilty was rather reticient 
about the situation in Germany and 
his opinion of it. It was quite dif
ficult to get him to talk about him
selfhe had very little to saybut 
a few of his views were outstanding 
and worth mentioning.
The situation in Germany at pres
ent is not too serious, according to 
Mr. Hilty. He said that the air 
raids were slight and that he used 
to stand out on his balcony and 
watch the R. A. F. drop bombs 
while all good Germans were in 
their shelters. The sight was 
enough to hypnotize anyone. He al
so remarked that the German feel
ing was definitely divided. Certain 
of the people with whom he came 
into personal contact strongly be
lieved that the only hope for the 
German people was to lose the war.
Mr. Hilty has now left for New 
York where he is going to have an 
audition with the Metropolitan Op
era Company. He is married to a 
former Tech music student, Vir
ginia Clovis, and has two children. 
One of them is named after Miss 
Seaman of our own Music Depart
ment. Before leaving for New 
York, Mr. Hilty visited Tech and 
talked to his former teachers who 
regard him as a fine person and a 
great singer.

By Bill King
A native of Puerto Rico, Mr. Al
berto Colon has been granted a 
years leave of absence from the 
University there to enable him to 
come to Tech to work on his Doc
tors Degree. He is short, well 
built, and looks more like a stu
dent than an instructor. His dark 
complexion and straight black hair 
truly indicate the Spanish blood 
that runs in his veins.
Bom in San Juan, the capitol of 
Puerto Rico, of Puerto Rican par
ents, he spent his first year in col
lege at the local university. Fol
lowing this he transferred to the 
University of Louisiana where he 
received his Bachelors Degree in 
Chemistry in 1937 and his Masters 
Degree in 1939. His attendance at 
the University of Louisiana was in 
keeping with a family precedent set 
by his father and several close 
relatives, who also went to that 
school.
During his three years there, he 
saw quite a bit of the famous Huey 
Long who was at that time a very 
ardent x-ooter for the University. 
Mr. Colon related sevex-al interesting incidents concexming the late 
Senator Long. One day when some 
wox-kmen were engaged in building 
a new swimming pool for the 
school, Mr. Long came by and re
marked upon the size of the pool, 
stating that it looked like the big
gest collegiate pool in the countiy. 
One of the men answered that there 
was one on the west coast some ten 
feet longer, whereupon Huey ordered the plans to be changed and 
the pool to be lengthened ten yards. 
During one of Louisianas more suc
cessful gridiron seasons, Huey Long 
attended the Vanderbilt game at 
Nashville, Tenn., and had quite a 
time marching up and down the 
streets of Nashville leading the 
Louisiana R. O. T. C. contingent. In
fact, that was the year Louisiana 
expected to go to the Rose Bowl, 
but was turned down in favor of 
Pittneedless to say, the South
erners were not very well pleased 
with the choice. Huey had a warm 
spot in his heart for the men of 
the gridiron and would make the 
outstanding football playexS of
ficers in the National Guard.
After i-eceiving his Masters De
gree at Louisiana, Mr. Colon re
turned to Puerto Rico where he be
came the Assistant Professor of 
Chemistry, at the University of 
Puerto Rico. Shortly thei*eafter, 
he was granted his leave of absence 
and came to Tech. At the present 
time, he and his wife are living 
with a close friend of hisone of 
his former teachers at the Uni
versity of Louisiana. Mr. Colon 
was very flattering when he said 
that Tech was the best school that 
he had yet attended, but that there 
was very little difference between 
it and the university in Puerto 
Rico. In fact, the school thex-e is 
like any American college. Its cam
pus is larger than ours, and the ra
tio of girls to hoys is much larger 
there.
The old city of San Ju-*n is a 
typical Spanish town, with narrow 
streets and old buildings. Recent
ly, however, the city has grown im
mensely and the new part is very 
modei'n and typically American. 
One of the reasons for the recent 
expansion is that the Ai-my and 
Navy bases there are being enlarg
ed. During the past year and a 
half, from fifty to sixty thousand 
men and their families have been 
tx-ansferred to the island to bolster 
the defenses. These bases play a 
vital part in the Caribbean de
fense system since they are the 
center of the ring of bases protect
ing the Panama Canal.

inches tall, she holds the offices of 
Secretary of Student Council, his
torian of Mortar Board, and takes 
an active part in the activities of 
Kappa Phi Delta sorority.
Dorrie is majoring in English and 
hopes to be a journalist on a mag
azine, preferably the New Yorker, 
after completion of this course.
Half of her life is spent at the 
Union. She worked last year on 
the Thistle and in the Registrars 
office for two years.
She thinks that shrimp cocktail 
is one of the greater delicacies of 
life. Tennis claims her attention 
when, as she modestly says, If I 
can find anyone self-sacrificing 
enough to play with me. Other 
interests in her life are picnics, mu
sic of any kind, playing bridge in 
the Beanery, writing letters (to 
Annapolis), and Spring Carnival.
Her irks are superstitious people 
and getting stuck with things to 
sell, particulai-ly tea dance tickets.
She numbers, as being among her 
favorite pastimes, dancing, talking, 
and eating, especially ice cream 
cones. She may be found in the

Chairman of the Budget Commit

Student Council. Mr. Burton feels 
that the Treasurer now has plenty 
of work. He moved to revise Ar
ticle II, Section II, Part 1, that 
the President of Student Council 
appoint the Chairman of the Bud
get Committee from the two Assist
ant Treasurers of the previous year 
who were not elected Treasurer.
Motion carried.
Mr. Richardson officially appoint
ed Mr. McBride as Budget Chair
man. Mr. Burton then added that 
the By-Laws contain no provision 
for election Chairman. He moved 
that Article II, Section 5 read: The 
Chairman of Elections and Eligibil

ident of Student Council from the 
incumbent members of Council. He 
is to handle all details of elec

Motion carried.
Mr. Richardson appointed Mr. 
Kritscher to replace Mr. Kelly as 
Chairman of Elections.
Mr. Reynolds complained that the 
TARTAN had not given complete or 
accurate information about the
elections. He said that people have
trouble finding the polls and asked 
that something be done to make 
more definite provisions for elec

TARTAN is not living up to the rec

a full and complete copy of the

explained that Mr. Moses had ask

Harry JamesColumbia
Misirlow (36390)  a beautiful 
love song set in an Egyptian back
ground and played in Harry James 
romantic style. The reverse side is 
Minka. a tune destined to be a hit, 
not only because of Harrys stir
ringly smooth interpretation'" but 
also because of the ballad by Dick 
Haymes which will make it a sure 
success.
Clauile ThornhillColumbia 
Moonlight Masquerade (36391) 
a charming mixture of subdued and 
lively music with a good vocal by 
Dick Harding and a bit of Claudes 
own keyboard artistry. On the

Memoranda
With Hie abundance of news and I,lie installation of new feat
ures, w<*. find ouiHelvoH without ample space in which to voice our 
thoughts.
I'Yoni our memo pad we see that we wanted to say something 
about the Jack oJ! unity in our cheering section at the first football 
game. Briefly, we feel that no matter what the reasons were the 
individual cheering section comprising the dorm students should 
have joined in with the cheering of the rest of the school. They may 
yell as much as they want to by themselves, but in respect for the 
name of our school they should cheer with the other students. Dorm 
men arc Tech men. Lets keep our troubles to ourselves. The pub
lic, need not witness dissension among the students.
We wanted to explain the position of the TARTAN in respect 
to printing the Council minutes, pointing out that the inclusion of 
verbatim minutes defeats the purpose of a college newspaperpre
senting news in a form which will appeal to the student. We would 
like to present the affairs of Council to the campus in the most en
tertaining and informative manner possible. Under present condi
tions we cannot do this by order of Council.
President Roosevelt's message to the Committee in charge of 
National Newspaper Week stressed the importance of the  incalcula
ble blessing which a free press confers. We ask whether the inclu
sion of veratim minutes is not an assault on free press.
Cum fprano Satis
A current campus question which 
has raised a great deal of com
ment is the varsity football situa
tion. Here is a cross-section of 
the opinion of Tech students on 
the de-emphasis of intercollegi
ate football by the present admin
istration."
Cleo Bateman, junior, printing. 
Perhaps it is deemed advisable 
from the viewpoint of not having 
the money to spend for a good team 
but the administration could 
probably do a lot more for football 
at Tech and still not spend ah out
rageous sum of money.
William King, junior, Ch. E. I 
definitely would like to see teams 
of the 38 calibre return to Tech. 
Paul Wines, senior, printing. The 
present de-emphasis program has 
been criticized too soon; it hasnt 
had a chance to 'work itself out. As 
we go out of the subsidation 
class, we enter a different class of 
football with truer sportsmen and 
truer spirit. When the de-emphasis 
program is complete, we will be 
playing teams of our own class, 
like Westminster, rather than those 
of the Noti;e, Dame class, with the 
result that Tech students will have 
an opportunity to cheer for a team 
of sportsmen, equally matched.
C. W. Newman, junior, mgt. In my 
opinion, the de-emphasis program 
at Tech is a definite mistake. Either 
the administration should sponsor 
a good team, or cut out the big 
time schedule; preferably the 
I'Ormer.
Frank Martin, junior, mgt. "The deemphasis movement is highly com
mendable from the scholastic point
of view, but financially inadvisa
ble.
Marianna Hogg, junior, secretarial. 
If there is going to be any team 
at all, I think that more import
ance should be placed upon it. After 
all, those boys spend a great deal 
of their time working at this game 
and they should' get more than 
credit for it.
Mike Wander, freshman, Ch. E. A 
football team needs spirit behind 
itencouragement, cheers. It is 
equally true that the' cheering part 
of a school, the students 'with the 
spirit, need a good team to root 
for. We are anxious to see our 
team make a fighting bid for vic
tory. If we dont, we are disap
pointed, and intramural sporty do 
not make up for it. Emphasis 
should, without a doubt, be placed 
on intercollegiate football to a 
much greater extent than it is at 
present. It is indispensable in the 
preservation of school spirit and 
pride.
Mack Hewett, sophomore, aero. In 
the U. of Hawaii, where I was a 
student last year, we played foot
ball for the sport of it, alone. And 
although we played to win,, after 
the game was over it didnt seem to 
matter much whether we won or 
not. Personally, it doesnt make 
much difference to me whether we 
emphasize football or notI go to 
the football games to see 'the Kil
tie Band.
I leave it entirely up to the in
dividual as to what opinions should 
and what opinions should not be. 
taken cum grano salis, (with a 
grain of salt).
IvCto* to the Editor
Deai Editor:
Through no fault of the boys, 
through no fault of the coaches, 
through no fault of Doctor Baker's, 
'wo have no football team. Yet, 
and iL seems odd, three years ago 
our own Tartan team met Texas 
Christian in the Sugar Bowl. That 
Is the result of de-emphasis.
I realize that to keep a topllight football team costs money, 
'but. no one on campus wants to see 
ai team that always loses. It is 
humiliating to. the student body, 
and is liable to give Doctor Baker 
a bad name lie doesnt deserve. 
Spme argue that we can go into 
.games with such schools as West
minster, but I dont like the idea. 
With all due respect to the opinion 
of the administration, I still be
lieve that Carnegie should have a 
good team, no matter what the cost.
Other schools as large or larger 
than Tech have small-time football 
and suffer no humiliation. But with 
Tech its different; the Tartan team 
was once among the best in the 
land, but now it is a pitiable im
itation of what it once was. Al
ways there is in the students minds 
the fact that Carnegie was once 
high up, and that they are now in 
a period of rapid decline after the 
Introduction of de-emphasis. Peo
ple ask, "Where Is Tech? Whats 
the matter with Carnegie?" The 
Techite, confronted with these 
questions, Is in an embarrassing 
position, for he has no excuses, 
and only the feeble, laughable to 
outsiders, alibide-emphasis."
All this does not aid school spir
it. No one wants to root for a 
team that doesnt win. And no 
one feels happy about having his 
school laughed at through the news
papers. From this it would appear 
that once a football school, always 
a football school. I think this is 
true, and for that reason I believe 
that the de-emphasis program 
should .be given up. I am sure it 
would result in an increase in de
votion of the students to their Al
ma Mater, and a return of the old 
Tartan prestige on the gridiron.

as it was in the early 1930s. This 
is a definite disadvantage for the 
graduating class of 1945.
I will not say that the electrical, 
mechanical, and civil engineer will 
not have advantages four years 
from now; but I will say that the 
advantages of the chemical engi
neer will overshadow them all.
Better living through chemistry 
is the motto of the Du Pont Cor
poration; and I believe that this 
phrase is symbolic of the tremend
ous future in store for the chemist 
and the chemical engineer. The 
plastics and the nylon industries 
are the examples that we know 
best; but these aie only a begin
ning. We all know that our nat
ural resources are dwindling, and 
that some day the creations of the 
chemist will have to replace them. 
Today nylon is superior in many 
ways to steel and wood. The same 
can be said for chemical rubber 
and chemical gasoline. I am careful 
not to use the word substitute, for 
substitute implies an inferiority 
of the product and this is not the 
case. A better phrase would be 
a superior product.
The day of the chemist is com
ing, and soon the eyes of the world 
will turn from the earth to the 
chemist to look for its needs; and 
the chemist will give to the world 
products superior to those of Moth
er Nature, herself.

I believe that a countrys 
strength is in direct proportion to 
the average intelligence of its pop
ulation; that is, a country with a 
high average of intelligence is 
sponger in most ways than a coun
try with a lower average intelli
gence. An engineering education 
is higher than that of the average 
individual; and in a sense, pur
suit of this higher educaton raises 
the average intellgence of the peo
ple; and each engineering student, 
in a small way, helps strengthen 
his country merely by being ed
ucated. This,. I believe, constitutes 
an- engineers worth to society; for 
by acquiring a technical education, 
he not only makes himself more 
useful in a technical way, but even 
more important, he acquires a sci
entific mind, with which he sees 
things that other people dont, and 
with which he can cope with prob
lems more effectively from a tech
nical angle.
The engineer is probably affect
ed as much by national depressions 
as is the laborer. This constitutes 
a problem for engineering students 
entering school this fall. Right now 
engineers are in demand and there 
is a shortage. Four years from now 
this situation may well be reversed

twenty-one, where they' fumbled 
and the Lions recovered. On the 
third down Albright made a pass 
which was intercepted by Holets 
who ran the ball down to the three 
yard .line. Cantini toolc the ball 
over for the touchdown. Matonis 
muffed the placement. Shortly 
after that Philipchulc intercepted 
another pass, and again Tech cashed 
in on the play with Johnson taking 
the ball over for the second score. 
Again Matonis failed to make the 
extra point. The last quarter show
ed nothing of importance except 
that Tech continued playing good 
football.
Next week the Tartans go to face 
M.uhlenberg at Allentown and with 
Fridays win under their belts, we 
can hope that, in spite ol the fact 
that Muhlenberg is rated well, Tech 
will repeat and take the Allentown 
boys in their stride.

Cross country prospects look 
the best since the sport was rein
stated in Techs athletic program. 
The team has been constantly gain
ing strength during the past few 
years. This years thin clads should 
be the best harrier squad which 
Tech has put on the track since 
nineteen thirty. The turn out for 
the varsity is unusually good. 
Teresi, last year's captain, Marcin, 
the captain this year, Frank 
Pritchard, sensational freshman 
miler, Simboli, Puskusiki, Lender, 
Schwindler, and Metzler are all po
tential threats. With a group of 
runners composed of men of such 
caliber, Tech should be able to 
dampen the spirits of any oppos
ing team.
The plebe team* also shows pros
pects of a successful team. The 
squad, although not large, has ma
terial which should develop into 
excellent varsity runners. Duum, 
V. M. I. ace quarter miler, Keen, 
Baltour, Aroy, McKinis, and Mc
Farland are all boys who.should be 
first class varsity material. The 
freshmen have a series of meets 
with the Pittsburgh High Schools 
including Westinghouse, Langley, 
Schenley, Peabody, and South Hills. 
If the crop of freshmen runners 
continues to look, as good, Carnegie 
Tech may look forward to success
ful teams during the next few yeais.
The chief factor for the. mediocre 
squads during the past years is that 
during the depression this sport 
was discontinued. When the 
athletic program permitted the 
sport to be reinstated the material 
was lacking. However, the team 
has been building up each year 
under the able coaching of Guy 
Halferty until it will again be on 
the same level with Pitt.

Tartans Subdue Albright Eleven
Displaying a complete reversal of form, the plaicl gridders fili
ally got. moving under the lights and took over a much larger Al
bright team to the tune of two touchdowns. The Albright team went 
to town in the first half, making seven first downs to the Sldbos 
two, but the second half was a different story. The two Tech touch
downs which came in the third quarter seemed to take all of the 
fight out of the home town boys, and they gained only two yards by 
rushing the entire second half. Although the Albright line was 
much heavier,, the Tech boys outruslied them to stop a great many 
of tlieir plays:
Doc Baker should be given the credit for this win because it is 
the perfect example of how good coaching and a good system can 
defeat a team of better material. Time after time the Tech line 
.bowled over the Albright forward wall because they squatted too 
far back on their heels and could not get rolling forward fast 
enough. In addition to this, the Lion backfield caught the ball 
standing still, enabling the Tech line to capitalize on their fast rush
ing. Bill Purcell, sophomore guard, should be given the orchids this 
week for the fine line game he has been playing to date. According 
to many of his teammates, Bill is the scrappiest lineman on the 
team and has been in the center of most of the action in both games 
that Tech has played.
Casualties Back in Action
The last of the boys injured in pre-season scrimmage, Bill Min
kel, got back into action in last Fridays game. An injured heel kept 
Bill out of the lineup for the Westminster game, but it could not 
bench him completely for the second game. Several other members 
of the squad have been playing a lot of football the last two games 
under the handicap of injured legs, namely, Big John Lindberg and 
Virg Cantini.

The first games of the current 
Intramural football season got un
der way last week. Many of the 
games scheduled were called due 
to a lack of water wings. As a 
result of last week's precipitation 
eighteen teams found time to play 
only 8 games. The general pro
ceed ure for the playing of post
poned games is the two teams agree 
upon a date in the very near future; 
and set the date according to the 
openings in the schedule. Then as 
soon as this is agreed upon, Mr. 
Eyman is to be notified so that he 
can have an official on hand and a 
field available. Those teams are 
asked to play these games as soon 
as possible.

Tartan Booters Start 
Season With 4-0 Loss
Last Saturday the Carnegie Tech 
Soccer team suffered a 4 to 0 de
feat at the hands of Frostburg 
State Teachers College. Although 
the.score would indicate that the 
Tartans played a poor game, such 
is not the case. Frostburg is re
puted to be the best team the Car
negie Toch hooters run up against, 
and since this game was the first 
one of the season, with the squad 
having less than two weeks of prac
tice, not too much could be expect
ed of them. However, they played 
a good game considering their lack 
of experience. Judging from their 
performance on Saturday, the team 
stands a good chance of winning 
many of Oho rejmainlng Janies, 
provided they get more practice and 
improve their teamwork.
Two of the four goals the Teach
ers made were In the first quarter, 
and early in the second the third 
goal was made. Then the Tech 
Booters rallied, and 'although they 
didnt quite score, they prevented 
Frostburg from making another 
goal until the last quarter. Caus
ing the greatest trouble for the 
Tartans were Shuff, the forward 
center on the State Teachers team.
Although the team -as a whole 
played a good game, there were cer
tain members who deserve mention. 
Three of these are Will Dean, Bob
Reisacher, and Pinky" Lees. This
years captain, Sam Rickley, also
played a good game.

was as follows:

porting a week ago last Tuesday. 
They will probably play four 
games, two being with Shadyslde 
and two with the Western Penn

The freshmen were welcomed in
to W. A. A. with the annual sports 
day on the cut. The girls., made 
acquaintances, played games, and 
really joined in the spirit of the 
day.
But that was all a long time ago. 
By now everyone is in her partic

men are oriented to their surround
ings. Therefore all we can do is 
remind you all that you are mem
bers of Carnegies W. A. A., and 
we want you to take advantage of 
all the opportunities this organiza
tion offers. Come out for your 
favorite sport! Were you active in 
high school? Then 'Continue your 
athletics in college and play on 
intercollegiate teams! Just chose 
one, two, or three sports you like,
watch the bulletin boards for an
nouncements of practices, and then 
show up and join in with your 
friends.
Hockey is already under way; 
again it promises to be Techs lead
ing fall sport, and we see the sticks 
clashing in real earnest this year. 
How about a good team? All we 
need is your enthusiasm and inter
est.
Archery signs are posted for those 
who are interested, and riding ar
rangements are being made for 
those who like the hoi'ses. In a 
vex-y short time other sports will 
be announced. Watch for them. 
Be sure to take advantage of your 
own W. A. A.; join in the Carnegie 
spirit and lets have some team
work.
CARNEGIE LINEMEN
George Matonis, (1), right end who does all the place kicking, and 
Bill Minkel, (r), left guard, are regulars in the Tartan line. Minkel, 
owing to a foot injury, didnt play against Westminster, but was in the 
Albright game last Friday night.

To Initial Win
Coach Eddie Bakers Tartan grid
ders played a night game in Read

against the Albright Lions. The 
game is significant because of the 
fact that it was shown that in the 
second half, Tech allowed the Read
ing boys only two yards by rushing 
and no first downs.
The Skibos made the opening 
kick-off down to Albrights eighteen 
yard line. Albright decided to kick 
and it was blocked, so that Tech 
had the ball on the Lions five 
yard line. As in the Westminster 
game the Tartans failed to cash in 
on their golden opportunity and 
failed to put it over. Instead, 
Cantini fumbled and Tech recov
ered on the fifteen only to fumble 
again. Again the Tartans recov
ered and tried for a field goal which 
fell short of its mark. Albright 
then made a series of advances 
by first downs through Techs line. 
Tech finally stemmed the tide and 
forced the Lions to kick away. The 
kick went over the Skibos goal 
and was brought to the twenty 
where Tech tried a series of line 
bucks which failed and they were 
forced to kick. Albright made no 
headway with their try on the oflensive and returned the kick.
The Tartans brought the ball 
back about fifteen yards, but on the 
third down they were thrown for 
an eight yard loss and kicked out 
of bounds on the fourth down. Al
bright made no gains and had to 
kick again from the forty-five. Pash 
returned the ball almost back to 
line of scrimmage. However, the 
same routine was repeated and Tech 
made no gains and had to kick 
away. The ball was returned to 
the twenty and the Lions advanc
ed the ball for a first down and 
the quarter was ended.
The second quarter was not any 
more spectacular than the first ex
cept that Albright was penalized 
twice for their baclcfield being in 
motion. The same see-saw motion 
on the field was evident in this 
quarter as in the first. Towa.ds 
the end of the half Albright inter
cepted a pass, but no harm was 
done.
In the third quarter, Albright 
kicked off to the Skibo gridders 
after which they made a series of 
advances down to the Albright

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 191
Students Had 
Fine Vacation
;YoCIYG4C4IS N3l, 
d3.4ol ;EG.C43GS
Evening Student Council and two 
of the evening school fraternities 
were active in keeping and deep
ening Tech friendships while school 
was adjourned this past summer.
Council sponsored its /Annual 
Workers Picnic, this time at Fosbaughs Farm near South Park; the 
affair was well-attended, and the 
usual good time was had by every
one.
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity held 
a Corn Roast at the Lodge in 
South Park, attended by a gay 
crowd that numbered almost two 
hundred.
William Spangler did an excel
lent job as Chairman of the Com
mittee in charge.
Phi Nu Fi'aternity held two Re
treats, an Anniversary Banquet, a 
picnic, and a stag party. Its Spring 
Retreat, which was a stag affair, 
took place at Buttermilk Falls, near 
Ligonier, while its Fall Retreat, a 
mixed affair, was held at Sugar 
Valley, near Bellefonte. Phi Nu 
men held their Banquet at the Uni
versity Club during June, cele
brating their 25th Anniversary. The 
annual picnic was held at South 
Park, and a stag party at the Fort 
Pitt Hotel rounded out Phi Nus 
summer program.
ELECTION PARTY 
THISTLE HALL 
SATURDAY, OCT. 11
Evening Colleges 
Will Hold Annual 
Session Saturday
Three-In-One 
Election Party 
To Be Oct. 11
This Saturday at 8:00 P. M. in 
Thistle Hall, the three evening col
leges, Fine Arts, Engineering and 
Industries, join together in staging 
a combined election party which is 
the most radical change that has 
been made on the evening campus 
since the beginning of Evening 
Student Council at Tech.
Breaking away from the prece
dent of many years standing in 
which each individual college held 
its own election smoker or party to 
elect officers for the year, this 
years innovation promises to be 
the most outstanding affair on the 
evening social calendar.
The combining of the heretofore 
separate elections into one huge 
party was done to save both time 
and money and provide an excel
lent opportunity for the students to 
become acquainted with those from 
the other evening colleges.
This years program is being 
planned for both the female and 
male evening students registered. 
Thus the females who have in by
gone years been timid about at
tending an election party or smoker 
need not be afraid of being out of 
place, but are encouraged to attend 
and join in the social activities of
the evening colleges.
The program will consist of en
tertainment, dancing, refreshments,, 
and real honest-to-goodness voting 
with plenty of electioneering dur
ing the evening.
Admittance to this party will be 
by Evening Registration card. It 
is important that the student have 
his Registration card as it must be 
presented during election when 
ballots are being distributed.
David Pettigrew, President of 
this years Evening Student Coun
cil, will conduct the elections. Vot
ing will be by secret ballot, the stu
dent voting only for those students 
registered in the college in which, 
he is registered. Those elected 
that evening will automatically be
come the Evening Student Council 
members for this year.
Candidates aspiring to hold of
fice should read the eligibility rules 
in the Council Handbook.

PARTY
You'll join the millions who say
WITH ME ITS CHESTERFIELD . . .
About 10:15 tonight I walked into 
the Plaid paper office to find exact
ly four workers present. The Ed
itor and News Editor accounted for 
two of these and the others were 
day school students. Now fellow 
students, if the Plaid is to continue, 
we must have your help and we 
must have it immediately. Nat
urally you can all take the easy 
way out and not show any of the 
much needed cooperation, but that 
will mean sacrificing the pleasure 
of reading your weekly copy of this 
paper. Four people cannot publish 
a paper in one evenings time.
For those of you who cannot feel 
the urge to help just for the sake 
of doing your part, there will be 
rewards.
Every year the evening school 
holds several dances. If you are 
one of the many Tech students who 
enjoy dancing, you will find the 
Tech dances to be much more en
joyable providing you are well ac
quainted with others attending the 
social get-togethers. Now ,by com
ing out and working on the Plaid 
you will meet a lot of newpeople 
that are well worth knowing. This 
is your first and probably the best 
award you can possibly receive.
The second reward is one that 
can be received only by doing a 
maximum quantity of work. To 
those who receive enough points 
awarded to all workers, there will 
be an Insignia Banquet given some 
time after the close of the school 
year. This Banquet is given for 
those who have at least 30 points 
(four of which must be from your 
own college), by the end of the 
year. At the close of the dinner, 
the Insignia Keys are given to those 
deserving students who have freely 
given their time in putting over the 
social affairs and the paper of C. 
I. T. Evening School.
Why not give this subject consid
erable thought? The Plaid is badly 
in need of your support as is quite 
evident by the situation that faced 
the few of us present on this first, 
evening of publication. Once again, 
we appeal to you evening students 
give us a hand on the Plaid. 
Youll never have any reason to re
gret it.
Parking Problem 
Eased By Adding 
Restricted Areas
For the convenience of the night 
students, the Tech officials have 
set aside regular reserved parking 
areas behind Machinery and En
gineering Halls and along Margaret 
Morrison street beside the College 
of Fine Arts. These are in addi
tion to the unrestricted areas across 
Frew street from Industries, both 
sides of Tech Street, and on both 
sides of Margaret Morrison Street 
from Tech Street to Forbes. There 
is also a large area behind the fac
ulty houses along Margaret Morri
son Street across from the mens 
dormitories which is also unresricted.
The restricted area is desirable, 
since there are so many who travel 
to and from school in cars, and free 
space is crowded. This year park
ing buttons will be required to ad
mit students into this area. These 
buttons may be purchased at the 
registrars office for fifteen cents. 
Your name and license and regis
tration numbers will be required in 
order to obtain them.
These buttons will not guarantee 
a parking place, but they will allow 
you into the restricted areas.
Students are asked to please oc
cupy a minimum of space. Also, 
remember that all parking is sub
ject to city and state laws.

Recognition Given 
Active Students 
At Insignia Dinner
Keys Awarded 
Plaid, Council, 
Dance Workers
The Banquet Room of Ca^Hegie 
Inn was the scene of the anual In
signia Award Dinner, at which 
time Evening Student Council was 
host to the administration and the 
workers, who in the past year were 
successful in earning their Insignia 
Awards for extra-curricular activ
ities.
The group in attendance was for
tunate in having Dr. Doherty as a 
guest, even though he has been 
kept very busy with his work, di
viding his time between Washing
ton and Pittsburgh, and the guests 
were grateful for his concern.
Of the group present, twenty-one 
of them received their first Insig
nia. This first Insignia is in the 
form of a silver key with the Car
negie Tartan as its background. 
Superimposed on this background 
are the letters C I T and a white 
crescent, signifying the evening sec
tion of the Institute. At the top 
is a star symbolizing a point of 
merit for those students who stand 
out from the rest because of their 
interest in extra-curricular affairs. 
At the bottom of the Insignia are 
found the numerals of the year the 
award is made.
Fifteen guests received their sec
ond award, which is a gold key of 
the same type as the first Insignia, 
and nine received gold keys with 
rubies, which is given as the third 
award. The fourth and fifth 
awards made were in the form of 
certificates given to students com
pleting their fourth and fifth years 
in activities. Of the group presr 
ent, nine received the fourth and six 
were given the fifth award. In 
addition to the above Insignia were 
awards to George Brassine, his 
sixth; ninth award to Russell Lahr; 
tenth to David Jones; and seven
teenth to E. E. McDonald.
Tn addition to Insignia awards. 
Evening Student Council scholar
ships were given to Fred M. Fargotsteln from Fine Arts; James 
Lchren from Industries, and David 
Pettigrew from Engineering for 
scholastic standing and record 
made while working on student ac
tivities.
After a pleasant evening, the 
party was ended with a reminder 
that activities for the year would 
be under way very soon, and much 
support was needed from Insignia 
holders to get new workers out for 
the affairs.
Last Chance
Registration Ends 
Tomorrow Night
Tomorrow night, October 8, is 
the final night to register for 
classes in any of the colleges. This 
does not, however, include regis
tration for the special national de
fense courses.
Registration for all courses offer
ed in each college is done in the 
Registrars Office on the first floor 
of the Administration Building, 
Since the regular period for even 
ing school registration is over, ail 
enrollment done now is consider
ed as tardy and and all persons 
will be charged one dollar for late 
registration.
Tonight and tomorrow night are 
the last opportunities to sign up for 
this semester.
Window Display 
Course Offered 
At Night School
Last Thursday evening, October 
2, a new course in one of the new
est branches of commercial artwindow and merchandising dis
playswas begun, in the evening, 
school of the College of Fine Arts. 
Mr. Lazzlo Gabor, architectural di
rector of. Kaufmanns department 
store, is directing the course. He is 
also a part-time Assistant Professor 
of Architecture at Carnegie Tech.
The new merchandising course 
offers an excellent opportunity to 
those interested in designing and 
setting-up window displays, since 
this field has progressed rapidly -to 
a point where it requires a tech
nique comparable to that used in 
designing settings for the legitimate 
theater.
Mr. Gabor will lecture to the 
class and will assign problems in 
display to the students. He will 
also hold inspection trips to various 
Pittsburgh stores to study display. 
This course in merchandising is 
held on Thursday evenings at 7:30 
.oclock, Room 10(5 in the Fine Arts 
Building. Applicants should have 
had experience with merchandise 
or the arts, but drafting ability is 
not required.
The scope of the new course is 
Illustrated in Mr. Ga'bors state
ment that A displayman must 
know color, lighting, and such ma
terials as paints, metals, plastics, 
woods, papers, rugs, and drapes; he 
should understand the fundamental 
relationship between display and 
the fields of sculpture and paint
ing.
