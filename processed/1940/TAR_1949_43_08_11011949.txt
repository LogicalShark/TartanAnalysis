Don't Forget Campus Chest 
Give Your $2 and Carnegie 
Will Go Over The Top
VOL. 43No. 8CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PATUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 194*
McKinley To Play At Homecoming
Campus Chest 
Starts Drive 
Tomorrow
Committee Sets Goal 
For Entire Campus 
At $10,000 Minimum
Tomorrow morning marks the 
beginning of this years Campus 
Chest campaign. Never before 
have Carnegie Tech students been 
reached by so many worthy orrganizations at one time. By Frida; 
afternoon the Chest committi 
hopes to announce that the C 
pus has reached and oversub
scribed the campus-wide goal 
$10,000.
Every student in every class 
room will be contacted by the so
licitation committee and will be 
asked to contribute directly or by 
means of a pledge to be payable 
later at the cashiers office.
One And Only One
By making use of this one op
portunity to help as many needy 
persons as possible, students, fac
ulty members, and employees will 
assure themselves that never 
again during this school year will 
an organization of any kind come 
on the Campus and ask for con
tributions. One drive, one con
tribution, one effort keynotes this 
years Chest activities.
With Dick Cutkosky and Alpha 
Phi Omega heading a group of 
more than 100 solicitors, an effi
cient and well-organized plan of 
classroom solicitation will result. 
Instrumental in this program have 
been the Registrars office and in
structors of each class to be con
tacted.
Well Organized
Mr. Rogers and his staff have 
been very willing to provide the 
committee with complete and upto-date lists of every student en
rolled for the fall semester, as 
have been Mr. McKelway and his 
staff for the night school stu
dents. Instructors have been most 
f'racious in allowing contact men 
to present their sales talk during 
the first ten minutes of each per
iod.
Though the committee had a 
tough job in determining how 
much money to expect from each 
student, their final decision was 
that the convenience and intelli
gent administration of funds af
forded by federated fund raising 
should be more than enough to 
persuade him to give once, give 
enough for all.
Dr. Gilmer Speaks 
In Program Series 
At Canterbury
Dr. B. von Haller Gilmer, head 
of the department of psychology 
and education, will speak at Tech 
Canterbury House on Sunday, No
vember 6. His subject will be 
Psychology and Religion. This 
talk will be one of a series being 
given at Canterbury House, 5170 
Margaret Morrison St., through
out the year.
Speaking the following week, 
Sunday, November 13th, will be 
Dr. Emerson N. Pugh, professor 
of physics, on Science and Reli
gion.
All students are invited to at
tend these supper-discusions.

Pitt, Duquesn, and Carnegie chapters are co-sponsors of the af*fair which will entertain and inActivities Forms
All women who have not fill
ed in and returned their activi
ties forms to the Dean of Wom
ens office should do so as soon 
as possible.
These forms are needed for 
reference many times, not only 
during college, but also after 
graduation. Honoraries and 
sororities use the forms in de
termining membership, em
ployers often use them for se
lecting employees, and other 
colleges need them for Carnegie 
transfers.
Be sure to keep them up to 
dateif you are elected to an 
office, join a sorority, or win an 
award, go to the Dean of Wom
ens office and complete the 
form. It will help you when you 
give them the information.
Tau Beta Pi Honors 
Second CIT Woman
Mary Lou Bacon, chemistry senior, was presented with the Tau 
Beta Pi womens badge at the honorarys banquet last Tuesday 
evening. Miss Bacon is th3 second woman to be so honored by the 
Carnegie chapter and one of about eighty in the history of the 
engineering and science honorary. ?
The banquet was given in hon
or of Dr. and Mrs. Cory, the na
tional president and his wife. Dr. 
Cory was the principle speaker of 
the evening and discussed activi
ties and plans of the organiza
tion.
Established for men only in the 
days when women scientists were 
unheard of, the honorary has seen 
a battle concerning the initiation 
of women as full members at the 
last four national conventions.
Carnegie Techs chapter led the
drive at the last convention, held 
last month, but the three-quarter 
vote needed to change the consti
tution so that women could be
come members was not achieved. 
Each year the drive has gained 
additional followers and will 
probably be accepted in the next 
few years.
If this amendment is approved, 
both Miss Bacon and Miss Julia 
Randall, the other woman honor
ed by CITs Tau Beta Pi, can be 
initiated as full members.

Bagpipe Clan Travels 
To Marietta Saturday
Early this Saturday morning 
Carnegie Techs Bagpipe Clan will 
leave for Marietta, Ohio, to ap
pear at the Carnegie-Marietta 
football contest. The group in
cludes nine pipers, one Scotch 
drummer, four snare drummers, 
one sword dancer, and one drum 
major. The Marietta students had 
originally planed to finance the 
trip for the entire Kiltie Band, but 
unfortunately the cost of sending 
the whole organization far ex
ceded the fund which was raised.
4Lands Most 
Versatile Band 
Plays Saturday
Billed as the most versatile 
band in the land, Ray McKinley 
and his orchestra will play for 
the Saturday night dance which 
climaxes Homecoming on Novem
ber 12 in the mens gymnasium.
A sweater and skirt dance will 
be held on Friday night in the 
gym and will feature Jack Purcell 
and his band. Tickets for the 
dance will cost 75 cents. This 
dance is sponsored by Citcom and 
Dorm Council.
Sponsored By Delta Skull 
Sponsored by Delta Skull, mens 
junior class honorary, the Satur
day dance will'be semi-formal. 
Tickets will go on sale in Skibo 
next Monday at $4.00 per couple.
Semi-formal Defined 
[The dance committee has de
fined semt-formal as anything 
but skirts and sweaterssuits for 
men, dresses or gowns for women.] 
Although it is one orchestra 
which holds its own in the hallow
ed halls of jazz, McKinley picked 
up considerable prestige as a dance 
band at college proms throughout 
the country, last year.
Fine Arrangements 
One of the finest arranging staffs 
in music is behind every Ray Mc
Kinley presentation. Headed by 
Eddie Sauter and Deane Kincaide, 
the McKinley writers have hit the 
top in the past with such tunes as 
Civilization, You Came A Long 
Way From St. Louis, Arizay, 
and other hits.
Promising to play only what 
Carnegie students want at their 
dance, McKinley will probably 
have many requests for some of 
his specialty numbers throughout 
the night.
Dale Nunley and Some Of The 
Boys will be featured along with 
the orchestra.

Once For All
Tomorrow the campaign opens to fill the Cam
pus Chest. Organized late last spring, the com
mittee co-ordinating the fund drive has done a 
tremendous job in contacting soliciting organi
zations, determining the just allotment of dona
tions. and publicizing the drive.
We are sure the students of CIT. who 
are not the richest as the countrys campuses 
i go, will not let the committee down. Their 
first obligation, however, Is not to the stu
dents who have organized this combined 
fund drive ,but to the thousands of unfor
tunates aided by the money collected.
Seven of the most worthy charities have ac 
eepted this combined drive as their campaign 
These charities nurse the sick, clothe the poor, 
relieve the disaster stricken, and rehabilitate the 
discouraged in this country and throughout the 
world. They have agreed to the combined drive 
as an aid to you by removing the necessity of 
seven separate solicitations during the year.
Our statisticians have arrived at the figure 
of two dollars as the minimum donation from each 
student if the Chest is to reach its goal. Is a car
ton of cigarettes or an evening at the Greeks 
too much to give up so that others may live?
Looking Up
It seems Mr. Parrs letter of resignation to 
Student Council has brought a few changes in 
Council. Last week a detailed report from the 
budget committee chairman initiated the councilmen to their duties and powers.
This report was very instructive and many 
eouncilmen were enlightened. We hope this same 
program continues until all the committee heads 
have a chance to tell their stories. We feel some 
of these committee heads will be enlightened also.
Another surprise at Council was the effi
cient handling of the Glee club and Kiltie 
bands request for a loan. The Council mem
bers assured themselves they would not lose 
money and that the whole matter was a 
sound plan. They did this, and then quickly 
approved the loan. Xo useless questions were 
asked because everyone was on their toes 
and interested in the job they were doing.
This is the kind of a Council that will be
looked up to by the student body; the kind of
a Council that accomplishes things; the kind of
a Council that will make people turn out to
vote without being pushed.
Blissful ?
Elsewhere in this issue we present a new fea
ture, the Inquiring Reporter. We chose for our 
question Do you think Student Council justi
fies its existence. The results were very disheart
ening as almost all of the twenty students interviewed knew nothing of Student Councils 
activities.
Possibly our random choice of students was 
rot a true cross section of the student body, but if 
it was, there is a definite need for action. If 
Student Council is to receive the support of the 
students, it must first educate the students to 
its purpose. We suggest Council investigate the 
need for such a project immediately.

Do You Need Monev?f
See Your "Alma Pater
Alma Mater, Latin for foster mother, is what 
students and alumni call their college, but many 
times alma paterfoster fatherwould be a bet
ter name.
Thats when the college, like father, provides 
a much needed few dollars to help a student 
over a temporary loan period.
Almost all colleges do it.
Carnegie Institute of Technology, for example, 
has three student loan funds, with a principal 
totaling several thousand dollars, from which 
students can borrow when the going gets a 
little tough.
Just Like Dad
But it is the nature of this borrowing that 
so often puts the paternal element in alma mater. 
Just like dealing with dad, there is little talk 
about the student giving the money back. How
ever, in almost every case, the students do pay 
back the money they receive, .according to the 
Dean of Men, J. A. Dickinson, who administers 
Carnegies loan funds.
Except for a few outstanding loans which 
the students concerned are, as yet, unable to 
repay, Dean Dickinson explains, the principal 
in our funds is just about what it was when 
they were established.
Little Red Tape
One, the Deans Emergency Fund, from which 
students can get small amounts of cash in a few 
minutes and without any red tape, has turned 
over four times since it was established a few 
years ago.
This fund, unlike the other two maintained 
by Carnegie,* was set up by the students them
selves with profits from the annutal Scotch and 
Soda musical and Spring Carnival.
Most often used because of the ease of bor
rowing from itstudents rarely need much, but 
they need it quickthis fund has given Car
negie undergraduates over $1,200 in loans aver
aging $20 during the past 15 school months.
Usually the money is borrowed to fill in a 
gap between checks, but there have been cases 
in which the money was used to help pay a ma
ternity bill or meet an installment on a married 
students furniture.
Unbusiness-like Principles
The fund with the most unbusiness-like prin
ciples is the Student Welfare Fund established in 
1925 by the late Professor Alexander J. Wurtz, 
one of Carnegies first faculty members.
Professor Wurtz, who also established a progiam to provide Christmas dinners and parties 
for students who cant get home for the holidays, 
wanted the interest from his fund given to needy 
students with no mention whatsoever of repay
ment.
In paying hospital bills,* buying eye-glasses, 
and providing money for hard-pressed students, 
Carnegie has carried and is carrying cut the 
generous professors wishes.

Campus Chest 
Offers Chance 
To Help Needy
Editor, the Tartan:
The Campus Chest offers Car
negie Tech students and person
nel the remarkable advantage of 
being able to help others and our
selves at the same time. Not only 
is solicitation upon solicitation 
eliminated, but every dollar con
tributed will be administered in 
the most efficient possible way.
Federated fund raising is Amer
icas answer to the so-called wel
fare state. Anything that can be 
done by paid government em
ployees can be done more efficient
ly and effectively by sincerely in
terested individuals who want to 
provide people with the oppor
tunity to help each other.
As long as individual effort is 
more than sufficient to maintain 
needy members of our society, 
national communization of this 
effort will never threaten our ex
istence as more than insignificant 
blobs of humanity.
Every Service 
The Chest is far above a me
chanism for emptying ones 
pocketbookit is important to a 
secure community, nation, and 
world. Chest funds will perform 
every service from marriage 
counselling and care of handicap
ped persons here at home to re
building and re-equipping devas
tated colleges and universities 
from London to Bombay. Every 
contributed dollar will do more 
good for more people because 
charities can be balanced against 
each other and those most worthy 
given a larger share.
Our goal is high, but it repre
sents no more than the total given 
by students and faculty over each 
previous year, A contribution of 
three dollars is equivalent to giv
ing each of 112 charities 2.68 cents 
apiece. Surely a nickel per week 
for one year is not too much to 
invest in our fellowmen who de
pend on us for the privilege of 
living as demanded by all stand
ards of human decency.
More Effective 
We give no more and yet have 
the assurance that every gift will 
do more effective work than ever 
before. This combination of sin
cere contribution and intelligent 
distribution should convince every 
Techite that his duty and privil
ege is to help put the Campus 
Chest well over its goal.
Help yourself by helping oth
ersswell the Campus Chest.

Heard in the opening moments 
of one of the Pitt Players pre
sentations last year was the folowing disertation. The cawst for

Two Canadian gentlemen show
ed that they had some of the 
shrewdness necessary for a suc
cessful business career. They are 
wanted by the police. They swin
dled a loan company out of $100,-
000 and managed a three week 
headstart.
The C-Book is in the dummy 
stage now: might be out in two 
weeks. It will cost forty cents 
again, and will be peddled by APO 
the first couple of days.
At their Halloween party last 
Friday, the Chemistry Club un
veiled a unique, but appropriate, 
cider dispenser. Glass jars, bowls, 
tubes, coils and columns were all 
assembled in a wierd hodge-podge 
that looked like a freshman chemlab experiment that has gotten 
out of hand. Labeled Ole Doc 
Warner, the cider was siphoned 
from a monstrous jug. The 198 
proof brew bubbled and fumed, 
the crockery rattled, and the level 
of the cider went steadily downj ward.
CFP, Council of Fraternity Pres
idents, is weighing the advantages 
and disadvantages of delayed 
rushing. They are considering a 
plan which would prohibit any 
ruushing of freshmen until the 
beginning of the second semester. 
So far the idea hasnt traveled 
past the talk stage.
A by-product of this years rush
ing season was the $50 fine im
posed on a fraternity for break
ing one of the rules set up to 
govern rushing procedures.

Scimitars, Cwens, and Delta 
Skull were disappointed at the 
response to their W&J bus ven

about finding enough busses to

hard pressed to fill one.
Apparently Washington was just 
a little too close so that there were 
enough rides to go around. It was 
still a good idea, even if only 
moderately successful. Back in the 
old days as many as 500 students 
made trips as far as New York 
City to follow the team..
This is the height of some
thing. A man appeared on Campus 
last week looking for a ticket to 
the Lehigh game. In the course of 
his search he revealed that he was 
not a Tech student, or alumnus, 
nor was he from Pittsburgh.
He was a Lehigh grad, and he 
wanted a ticket very badly be
cause all the time he went to 
Lehigh they never had a decent 
football team. The few games he 
went to were ghastly affairs in 
which his alma mater had its nose 
rubbed in the mud; he never saw 
Lehigh win a game. Soooooo....

Special Fund Set-Up For Veterans
tContinued from Page 2] 
Veterans at Carnegie have their 
own special fund, tjie Veterans 
Emergency Loan. Strangely 
enough even though Carnegie has 
its lowest veteran enrollment since 
the war, Dean Dickinson has lent
ex-GIs over $1,000 from this fund 
in the past two months.
In addition to these three funds, 
Tech maintains a long range loan 
program for students who must 
borrow large sums for tuition and 
other major expenses.

CFP Discuss 
Changes For 
Greek Sing
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
has been discussing tentative 
changes in the selection of Car
negie Techs annual Greek sing 
winners. One of the main issues 
pending change is the judging of 
the choral groups. Previously, the 
winners have been selected only j
by judges opinions, but the coun- Iicil is planning to draw up a check I 
sheet stating the qualities on j 
which the judges decisions must 
be based. If the check sheet is 
adopted, the groups will be judged 
for choral value and not enter
tainment value.
The council is also discussing 
the possibility of increasing the 
number in each group to a mini
mum of sixteen thus eliminating 
quartets and other small groups.

---------------------------------------------------

4TAWAIVTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1949
Carnegie Crushes Wash-Jeff\ 39-16
With the same lightning-like suddenness with which they lost 
it the previous week, Carnegie Techs footballers found their of
fensive power on Saturday and turned it loose on an amazed and
outclassed Washington and Jefferson eleven.
Billed as the "Battle of Cripples, the game fulfilled 
only part of its publicity for there was no battle to it. It 
was alL Carnegie.
W & J's Deacon Dan Towler and Walt Cooper did not don 
uniforms while Jack Sourbeer, even before he was forced to leave 
the game, was not at his best. The big line-bucker was quite ob
viously favoring his injured right arm on all occasions.
Dr Baker, however, elected to use his crippled players only on 
offense with pleasing results. They stormed their way through,, 
around, and over the Wash-Jeff defense rolled up a 32-0 lead in 
the first half. For a number of reasons the Plaid board of strategy 
decided upon relaxing their offense during the latter half, and clear
ed the bench while the starters took a much deserved rest.
Unquestionably the most outstanding single play of the 
game was Elmer Metzger's almost unbelievable touchdown
punt return. Racing lor the ball at full speed, the diminu
tive freshman met the ball and W&J end Joe Rodjon simul
taneously. Metzger bounced off the enemy captain and star 
lineman's now collapsed body and galloped in his peculiar, 
loping style through the rest of the team for the 67 yards 
which separated him from the end zone.
They helped Rodjon from the field, and from there on in the
ball game wTas Carnegies. They had little trouble solving the Jay 
defense for the rest of the contest, and until they started to coast 
after the intermission the Red and Black offense was kept well 
bottled up.
Several encouraging developments resulted from Dr. Bakers 
liberal substitution policy. A little freshman halfback, Irv Schecter, who didnt even dress for the first three games of the season,
hauled in a perfect Quent Holtz pass and looked like a seasoned 
veteran when he found himself caught between two opposing backs 
on the W&J five, cut back, and plunged between them for the 
touchdown.
The reserve offense also found itself in the closing mo
ments of the contest, and started to explode through the 
Jaymens defensive setup. Sparked by Holtz and Augie Deiovanni, they blasted their way deep into enemy territory 
before relinquishing possession of the ball.
Next Saturday's meeting with Marietta College is a more even 
match than schedules and scores would indicate. The Ohio school 
has been pointing towards the game writh the Scots all year and 
promises to be at its best next week.
It will be the last contest of the season for Marietta. They sur
prised the Tartan eleven last year at Forbes Field and are laying 
plans to go all out to achieve the same results again.
At any rate, it looks like a rocky road ahead with such 
teams as Lehigh and Grove City awaiting the Plaid team 
that has had neither an idle week nor a breather since they 
opened the season.
Cross Country Team Ready To Win
It seems that the winless harriers of Carnegie Tech are now 
ready to break their bad streak and join the parade of victories.
After two decisive losses to F&M and Case, they dropped a 
heart-breaker to Bethany last Friday. The three remaining oppon
ents are far from setups, but the steady improvement in the local 
runners indicates a winning team.
This afternoons meeting with Geneva Coventers may be 
the spell breaker. The Tartans have, on several occasions, 
made use of the Beaver Falls squad to check a down trend 
and looks towards utilizing them once more.

Meet Marietta
Tartans Hope For 
First Victory Over 
Pioneers At Marietta
Carnegie Techs football team 
will travel to Marietta, Ohio this 
Saturday where they will meet 
the Marietta College gridders. The 
Tartans will be out to break the 
jinx which the Pioneers seem to 
have over the Plaid.
In the three previous gridiron 
meetings of the two schools, Mar
ietta has come out ahead in every 
contest with a grand total of 61 
points, while Techs aggregations 
have been able to score but 7 
points against the Blue and White.
Weakened by Injuries
The Pioneers lineup has been 
riddled by injuries sustained in 
their first three games of the sea
son. Undoubtedly the greatest loss 
to the Marietta team was that of 
quarterback Bob Schmidt. Schmidt 
suffered a broken bone in his foot 
during the Pioneer 13-7 loss to 
Wilmington College on October 11. j 
Without Schmidt in the lineup, the ; 
Blue and White has been held to j 
a mere 60 yard rushing average 
per game and an 80 yard passing 
average.
In the punting uepartment the , 
Pioneers have the edge over the | 
Tartans with an average of 40 \

Mel Cratsley 
Speeds Up 
Scrimmages
By Frank Carter
With basketball season rapidly 
approaching, coach Mel Cratsley 
is increasing the pre-season pace 
by stepping-up daily scrimmages.
According to Cratsley, the 
teams first scrimmage, held 
against the freshmen last week, 
produced very poor results, hence 
the increase in the practice tempo.
Cratsley is depending on num
erous tricky plays for the bet
ter part of his offense, while the 
defense. will be solely man-toman.
Picture Looks Rosy
Although the Skibo coach re
fuses to commit himself by mak
ing any rash predictions on how 
well do this season, its no se
cret that the coming court season 
presents a rosy picture.
With such stalwarts as Theo
dore, Riehl, Katselas, McCullugh, 
Matsey, Beck, Hammann, Ellies, 
ONeil, and Bianchi returning, and 
with newcomers Tom Craig and 
Kay Thompson, Cratsley could 
come up with one of the strongest 
teams in the state with a few 
breaks.
Spirited and aggressive play by 
this years freshmen squad prom
ises to provide Carnegie fans with 
some good basketball in the pre
liminary games which are being 
re-inaugurated this year.
Phi Kaps, Delts Meet 
For IS at. League Title 
Today At 4:00 P. M.
Tomorrow afternoon the Na
tional League touch football title 
will go on the line and two un
beaten and untied squads, Phi 
Kappa and Delta Tau Delta, clash 
in a contest that will oust one 
from the lead and leave the other 
in sole command.
Both teams have run roughshod 
over their opposition to date and 
have been pointing towards their 
meeting. The game is scheduled to 
begin at 4:00 on field No. 1, which 
is nearest Forbes Street.
the Tartans this season as against 
one loss and one tie. The close to 
1000 Tech fans who made the trip 
to Washington, Pa., saw their team 
put on a first class exhibition of 
running and passing, plus a dem
onstration of blocking and tackling 
technique, which spoke well for 
the fine coaching of Dr. Eddie 
Baker and his staff.
Proverb Pays Off
Tartan gridders heeded well the 
advice of the old proverb, He 
who hesitates is lost, as they 
racked up five touchdowns in the 
first half of play. It was a hard 
driving, bruising Tech team which 
left the field on the long end of 
a 32-0 count when the half ended 
and made it possible for an injury 
plagued starting line to sit out the 
rest of the game.
The visitors, kicking off to W&J 
to open the game, allowed the 
Presidents only two plays before 
they started on their first touch
down drive. On the second play 
Quent Holtz, who played fine de
fensive ball throughout the game, 
recovered a Red and Black fum
ble on the W&J 24 and the Tartans 
took command. Four power plays 
through the line netted a first 
down on the 14 yard line.
Fougere Scores
Simcic then raced around right 
end for another Tartan first do\pn 
on the W&J one. It was there that 
the Tech attack almost bogged 
down. W&J pushed the ball back 
to the five yard line on the next 
two plays. However, the Tartans 
were not to be denied, and on 
third down Simcic looped a jump 
pass to Lou Fougere for a touch
down.
With three minutes left in the 
quarter, Elmer Metzger, dimin
utive Tartan -back, provided the 
most spectacular run of the after
noon. Taking a W&J punt on his 
own twenty yard line, he started 
up the field to the 35 where he 
collided head on with Joe Rbdjom, 
captain of the W&J team. He re
gained his balance, however, and 
behind superb blocking raced the 
rest of the distance for a touch
down.
Just A Breeze
With twelve min ites left to play 
in the half, Clyde Stahle recovered 
a W&J fumble at midfield. The 
Tartans rolled to a first down on 
the Red and Black 35. On the 
next play Nick Simcic skirted 
right end and went all the way for 
another Tartan touchdown.
And still they came. With four 
minutes left to play in the half, 
a pass from Bob Sommer to end 
Fritz Wilson, who in turn laterall: ed the ball to Nick Simcic, was 
good for 40 yards down to the 
W&J 6. An end run brought the 
ball down to the two and Sommer 
crossed the goal line on a quarter
back sneak for another touchdown.
Again!
The half ended three minutes 
later but not before Tech had 
scored another TD. Quent Holtz 
intercepted a pass on the W&J 37. 
He kept his finger in the touch
down pie with a 17 yard pass to 
end Fritz Wilson. With 20 seconds 
to play Holtz faded back once 
more and lofted a long pass into 
the outstretched arms of Irv 
Schechter. Pay dirt bad been denti ed once again.

Tartan Linemen 
Of The Week
A big victory over W&J pre
sented us with the happy neces
sity of selecting two Linemen of 
the Week. Our first salute goes to 
Clyde Stahle for his excellent de
fensive play. Stahle, a 5 11 185 
lb. tackle and a newcomer to the 
squad replaced the injured Norm 
Keats.
Twice he paved the way for 
Tartan touchdowns as he recov
ered W&J fumbles. His sparkling 
defensive play throughout the 
game gives Dr. Baker depth in 
the tackle position which has been 
lacking until now.
The other Lineman of the Week 
is Lou Fougere, 6 ft. 180 lb. end. 
Lou, playing with a leg injury, 
caught two passes while he was 
in the game, one of which went for 
a touchdown. What is more, his 
downiield blocking paved the way 
for many of the long runs made by 
Tartan backs. This is the second 
time that Fougere has been Line
man of the Week.

Cross Country 
Team Loses To 
Bethany, 27-28
In a valiant effort to break into 
the win column for the first time 
this season, coach Guy Halfertys 
Carnegie Tech cross country team 
fell one point short as they lost a 
heartbreaker to Bethany College 
by a 27-28 count.
The meet, first home engage
ment of the year after setbacks at 
Franklin and Marshall and at 
Case, was run over the Schenley 
Park course Friday afternoon dur
ing a steady rain.
Deficit Too Great 
After spotting the visitors the 
first two places, the Tartan endur
ance men made an outstanding 
effort to overcome the deficit, but 
the Bethany advantage proved to. 
be too great. The fact that the 
turning point of the meet came in 
the battle for sixth position serv
ed to prove that cross country is 
a team sport, where the efforts of 
every man count in the final total.
Bethanys LaTourette and 
Liedke crossed the- finish line in 
a dead heat for first place, cov
ering the distance in the excellent 
time of 24:55.- Carnegies John 
Cooper raced home 37 seconds 
later to give the Plaid third po
sition. With Bob Carman and Cap
tain Gene Cockrell following in 
rapid succession, the Tartans were 
still within striking distance of 
the visitors.
Sixth Place Decision 
However, Hamilton of Bethany 
overcame Joe McElhaneys 50- 
yard lead in the downhill home 
stretch to cop sixth place and 
clinch the meet. McElhaney made 
every effort to maintain his ad
vantage, but just didnt have 
enough ir reserve to staye off the 
speedy Hamilton.
Huhn of Bethany placed eighth 
followed by Bob Stackhouse and 
Jim Romauldi of the Plaid in 
ninth and tenth positions respec
tively. Even though Johnson, the 
visitors fifth runner, finished a 
poor last in. the field of sixteen, 
he is counted as having placed 
tenth. This procedure is due to 
the ruling that only the first five 
runners from each team are count
ed in the final tabulation.
Geneva Next 
The Tartans will resume their 
current home stand this afternoon 
when they meet a strong Geneva 
college aggregation. The meet is 
scheduled for 4:00 p. m. on the 
Schenley Park course.

Possibility of Carnegie 
Starting Mat Schedule
Approximately twenty men, 
with more expected, have turned 
out for wrestling under the 
coaching of Mr. C. G. Alexander 
and Mr. David A. See. Condition
ing, having begun in a mild form 
already, will be in full swing by 
the middle of November, with the 
intramural meets starting the first 
part of December.
Hopes have been aroused that 
this year might witness the estab
lishment of wrestling as a varsity 
sport at Carnegie. Already there 
are standing invitations from West 
Virginia, Case, Waynesburg, Pitt 
and others to compete with them 
in inter-collegiate wrestling.
Expansion Possible
The wrestling teams have avail
able good varsity material and 
most of the equipment that they 
need, and since the only winter 
sports now functioning are swim
ming and basketball it would not 
be difficult to find a place for 
wrestling.
One thing that is lacking and 
is holding wrestling from becom
ing a varsity sport are funds 
which the athletic budget does 
not provide. The allowance now 
granted by the school for ath
letics is insufficient to cover any 
more expenses which would occur 
from another team traveling about 
the country.
Unless the school grants addi
tional money to the athletic 
budget, wrestling will probably 
remain on the intramural basis 
for some time to come.

ATO Winning Streak 
Snapped By Sigma Nu
ATO fell from the unbeaten ranks last week as an inspired 
Sigma Nu six scored two touchdowns in the final frame to win by 
a 10 point margin. At half-time ATO led 4-2. Jim Holthaus kicked 
off for Sigma Nu and Wayne Ashbee returned the ball to the ATO 
20. Ashbee kicked on fourth down,*----------------------------------------------------
and Holthaus scampered back to 
midfield. Two plays later Holt
haus hit Howard Warren with a 
TD pass and Sigma Nu jumped 
out in front 7-4.
Defense Holds 
In the fourth quarter, ATO re
covered the ball in midfield on 
on interception. After being pen
alized five yards, the ATOs pick
ed up a first down on an aerial 
from Ashbee to Hank Morrow. 
Ashbee then ran to the Sigma Nu 
5 for another first. At this point 
Sigma Nu was penalized for be
ing offside and the ball was mov
ed halfway to the goal line. 
However, the Sigma Nu defense

then they took possession of the 
ball on their own' 3 yard line. 
The Sigma Nu offense swept to 
the ATO 20 and Holthaus tossed 
another TD pass to Jack Waters. 
The game was ended with Sigma 
Nu in possession of the ball in 
midfield. Final scoreSigma Nu 
16, ATO 6.
Three touchdown passes by Jack 
Collins were more than enough 
to lead Phi Kappa to a 29-9 vic
tory over Beta Sigma Rho. The 
Phi Kaps opened the scoring as 
Collins threw to Devlin in the 
end zone for a touchdown. They 
struck paydirt again when Em
mett King fell on a blocked punt 
to make the score 12-0. A pass by 
fullback Bill Meister to Jay Fried 
registered the only Beta Sig TD.
From there on it was all Phi 
Kap as Collins passed to Bill Trim

downs, and ran one over himself 
on a fake reverse and end run.
Aerials Effective
ASCE smashed Tau Delta Phi 
31-4. A long aerial from Schober 
to Doak gave ASCE the first score. 
A few minutes later Schober 
passed to Richard for the second 
ASCE tally. The Tau Delts never 
were able to solve the ASCE de
fense and the passing attack of 
the engineers was too much for 
the Tau Delt defensive team.
Kappa Sigma downed a stub
born P&D 2 team 32-11. The 
P&Ds scored the first TD of the 
game on a long pass to Bill ITofscher in the end zone. In a sizzling 
third quarter, the Kappa Sigs got 
their ground attack rolling and 
racked up tremendous fiains 
against the tiring P&Ds.
Kappa Sigma Swamps P&1>
Tom Fields broke over from the

After its annual exhumation and the usual battle between fra

council members, the proposal *--------------------------------------------------

Surplus Shells To Protect 
CIT Cyclotron Workers
Shells In Concrete 
Provide Protection 
From Active Kays
Naval target shells will protect 
research workers and delicate in
struments from harmful radioac
tive rays at the CIT synchro-cyclotron near Saxonburg.
Approximately 640 thousand 
pounds of surplus Navy shellheads are being encased in a con
crete wall to serve as a shield 
against rays from the 400 million 
electron volt atom smasher when 
it is put in operation next year.
Lead Not Essential
Most people think of lead when 
they think of protective walls, 
Dr. Edward C. Creutz, the cyclo
tron administrator, explained to
day, but lead is not the best pro
tecting agent against all types of 
radiation.
The Carnegie synchro-cyclotron will produce many diffei'ent 
rays, he added, and some of 
these easily penetrate lead. Therefore, we have had to develop a 
wall that would be as effective as 
possible in stopping all the harm
ful radiation that cyclotrons 
might produce.
Some radiation is best stopped 
by light elements, Dr. Creutz 
pointed out, while still other 
types are absorbed by heavy ma
terials such as lead or iron.
Water Gives Protection
"The walls surrounding the CIT 
cyclotron, he added, contain 
either steel or an iron-bearing 
ore, which fumishs the dense ma
terials, and a great deal of water, 
which provide? the necessary 
lighter elements.
.l.0aMTau .auiMT5.Mnau
Workmen begin pouring: the inner walls of the Carnegie Cyclotron 
at Saxonburg. Surplus Navy shell-heads will be encased in the wall 
to protect researchers from radioactive rays.
All of the walls are made of a 
special concrete mixture contain
ing only cement and magnetite, 
the iron-bearing ore. Nearly 16 
hundred thousand pounds of the 
magnetite ore are being used in 
the protective casings.
The protective walls are about 
eight feet thick, with over four 
feet of the special wall being 
packed with the 320 tons of shells.
Shells are being used only in 
the wall section that separates the 
machine from the adjoining con
trol room and laboratories.
Workers Protected
Although all of the surround
ing walls and ceilings are important, Dr. Creutz explained, this 
is the most important one, for this 
wall serves as the direct protection 
for the research workers who will 
experiment with the machine. 
Shells used on the project are 
surplus material furnished by the 
Office of Naval Research. This is 
in keeping with Carnegies policy 
of using war surplus material in 
its cyclotron wherever possible, 
and with the O.N.R.s policy of al
locating surplus to its contractors 
to bring about efficient use of its 
research funds.
Lincoln Offers 
Dual Awards 
For Engineers
The third annual competition 
of the Engineering Undergradu
ate Awrard and Scholarship Pro
gram was announced recently by 
The James F. Lincoln Arc Weld
ing Foundation of Cleveland, 
Ohio.
This program offers annually 
$6750 in awards and scholarship 
funds to engineering undergradu
ate students and to schools for 
the best papers prepared by un
dergraduates on arc welding de
sign, research, fabrication or 
maintenance.
Scholarships Awarded
A total of 77 awards ranging 
from $1000 to $25 will be awarded 
to students and $1750 for seven 
scholarships, will be awarded to 
schools.
Student papers may have a 
wide variety of subject matter 
and can be based on study or act
ual experience. Papers may de
scribe the welded design of a ma
chine or structure or any part of 
a machine or structure. Main
tenance and repair of machineiy 
or farm equipment is another 
subject as well as any phase of 
lelding fabrication^ Laboratory rereasrch and development work 
may also be described.
Dr. E. E. Dreese, chairman of 
the Board of Trustees of the 
Foundation, describes the purpose 
of this series of annual programs 
as the encouragement of the study 
of the science, technology and ap
plication of arc welding through 
the preparation of papers by stu
dents of engineering upon whose 
shoulders rests the responsibility 
for future industrial progress.

Does Student Council justify 
its existence? was asked by a 
nosy reporter last Friday in Skibo. 
A. few of the reactions to the 
question follow.
RobinsonAnschuetz
John E. ^Robinson, Chem. E. 
sophomoreThere has been
much publicity, but I havent seen 
anything good or bad come out 
of Council.
Robert H. Anschuetz, Met. E. 
juniorFrom what I have heard 
of council meetings, too much 
time is spent on bickering over 
procedure. Its accomplishments 
are good, but too little is accom
plished in their meetings.
RossignolPardueKen Rossignol, Drama sopho
moreI think that Student Coun
cil should be made more familiar 
to the student. Although it is 
supposedly representing the stu
dent body, I, as a student, am not 
familiar with what it is trying to 
do. It should become as close to 
the students as it is now to the 
administration.
Nancy Pardue, Drama sopho
moreI think that Student Coun- J 
cil has never affected me, and I 
do not know what it does.
