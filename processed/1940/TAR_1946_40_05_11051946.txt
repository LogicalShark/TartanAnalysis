Colgate Prentice 
Addresses A VC
Colgate Prentice, president of 
the Student Federalists, will speak 
at a special meeting of the AllCollege Chapter of the American 
Veterans Committee which will 
be held this week at a time and 
place to be announced shortly by 
bulletin board notices. The Pitts
burgh Area Council of the A.V.C. 
is co-sponsoring this affair.
At the meeting held Wednesday, 
October 30, it was decided to hold 
elections for officers on Thursday, 
November 14, at 7:30 in the Bellefield Presbyterian Church, located 
at. the corner of Bellefield and 
Fifth Avenues. A planning com
mittee of two men each from Car
negie Tech, Pitt, and Duquesne 
University was chosen to make 
future plans for the organization 
and to relieve the chapter chair
man of some of his burden.
All former members of the arm
ed services and the merchant ma
rine are invited to attend the spe
cial meeting to be held this week.
WCT Gives First Broadcast; 
Campus Station Tests Set-Up
WCIT>- Carnegie Techs campus 
radio station, went on the air with 
a half hour of popular recordings 
at 12:45 on Thursday. This pro
gram, the first of a series of test 
broadcasts,- .could be received by 
any radio in the permanent dormi
tories and academic buildings on 
campus. A, PA system in the Bean
ery amplified it for the benefit of 
the students lunching there.
Afjter two more broadcasts, one 
at 7:00 p. m. that night and the 
other at 12:45 on Friday, WCIT 
presented a special football broad
cast just before the Pep Rally on 
Friday. A1 Minetti, cheerleader 
emeritus, was featured in a per
sonal interview by Dave Crantz 
and Bill Thunhurst, two of the 
stations announcers.
An organizational meeting for 
all students interested in joining 
the staff of WCIT will be held at 
4:30 p. m. on Friday, November 
8, in the Radio Room in Fine 
Arts Building. Volunteers are 
needed to work on the technical 
equipment, the presentation of
Tartan Grads Gather 
For Oldtime Reunion
the broadcast itself, and the busi
ness administration of the station.
As soon as the staff of WCIT 
organized, the originators of this 
new activity plan to go on the 
air with several hours of broad
casting daily, chiefly during the 
afternoon and evening hours. The 
initial programs were intended 
primarily to test the quality of 
the reception and the reaction of 
the student body. Eph Abramson, 
who has assumed most of the re
sponsibilities of the organization 
thus far, announced that all re
ports were very favorable.
Until now the station has been 
operated by a skeleton crew com
posed mainly of the organizers of 
the setup. Frank Pake and Jim 
Woodford, who built the appara
tus, took charge of the technical 
end, Bob Parks directed the pro
grams, and A1 Checco, in addition 
to Bill Thunhurst and Dave 
Crantz, did the announcing. Eph 
Abramson, Elly Hovde, and Ernie 
Lowenstein were responsible for 
script writing and general admin
istration.

Student Federalist 
Gives Speech For 
World Government
Colgate Prentice, president of 
the Student Federalists, will speak 
Wednesday, November 6, at Car
negie Tech under the sponsorship 
of the International Relations 
Club. His address, which will be 
given in room 104. Industries 
Hall at 4:30 p. m., is open to the 
public. World Government, a 
Challenge, will be the topic of 
this 22-year-old veteran.

Canterbury Club 
Visit Glass Studio
The Tech Canterbury club has 
been invited by Mr. Howard Wil
bert to visit the Pittsburgh Stain
ed Glass Studios on Sunday aft
ernoon, November 10. Mr. Wil
bert, who has executed some of 
the finest church windows in this 
country, will show the club how 
they are designed and made.
Everyone going should be in 
front of the Carnegie Inn at 3:30 
Sunday afternoon from which 
they will be taken by car to the 
studios. A buffet supper, to be

luncheons every Thursday at the 
Inn (upstairs) any time between 
eleven-thirty and one-thirty.
AmendmentPassed
On Tuesday, October 29, Stu
dent Council held a balloting on 
an amendment to the constitution, 
which passed with more than the 
necessary two-thirds majority. 
The new amendment changes the 
representation on council from 
one member for every 100 stu
dents to one member for every 
150.
This amendment was proposed 
to provide a workable council of 
20 members rather than an un
wieldy organization of thirtythree members.
Memorial Service
A memorial service honoring 
Carnegie Techs war dead was 
held Sunday afternoon at the Car
negie Music Hall. About 300 per
sons attended the short, impres
sive ceremony.
The service was opened with 
the presenting of colors, followed 
by the national anthem and a 
prayer led by the Reverend Ray
mond J. Doherty, director of DePaul Institute for the Deaf. The 
chorus of the Department of Mu
sic added a touch of beauty to the 
program by singing Sanctus and 
Lachrymosa from Mozarts Re
quiem.
After Rabbi Burxon Levinson of 
Temple Sinai, and the Reverend 
L. Herdman Harris III, rector of 
Church of the Good Shepherd, 
conducted responsive readings, 
President Robert E. Doherty gave 
a memorial address, the highlight 
of the service. President Dohertys 
timely and moving speech was a 
fitting tribute to the Carnegie men 
and women who gave their lives 
so that we might live in freedom 
today. In saying the most fitting 
tribute to them is not a passing 
hour of thought, not a magnificent 
monument, but unending work for 
the cause which they served, he 
expressed an ideal for our world 
at peace. Carnegie Tech is serving 
this cause now by sending into the 
world each year hundreds of 
men and women who have started 
on the road to a professional life 
in which they recognize and 
shoulder their responsibilities to 
[Continued on page 7]
Doherty Announces 
Book Fund Plans
The establishment of a Memor
ial Book Fund honoring Carnegie 
Techs war dead has been an
nounced by President Robert E. 
Doherty. By contributing to this 
fund, alumni, friends, and rela
tives of Carnegie men and women 
who died in World War II may 
participate in a lasting, individu
alized, and useful memorial.
Under this plan, Carnegie Tech 
will allocate the equivalent of 
one-third its annual book appro
priation to purchase books marked 
in memory of the war dead as a 
group. For each individual dona
tion, a distinctive bookplate men
tioning the person memorialized 
and the donor will be placed in 
a book.
Contributions to the Memorial 
Book Fund may be made through 
the Alumni office or the School 
Library. The Library will inform 
the donor of the specific books 
purchased.
Wrong Addresses 
Delay VA Checks
The Veterans Administration 
has announced that more than 
3,000 veterans checks have been 
delayed because of incorrect mail
ing addresses.
Mr. Paul V. Bennet, chief of the 
Veterans Administration office of 
Pittsburgh, urges all veterans who 
have claims on file for any type 
of monetary benefit to notify the 
office of the V. A. concerning new 
permanent changes in address.
In giving their addresses, veter
ans should be sure to include the 
postal zone number. The lack of 
this information has been the chief 
reason for delay in delivery. The 
Veterans Administration also cau
tions veterans against giving in
definite boarding and fraternity 
house addresses since the postal 
authorities hesitate to deliver the 
checks to vague addresses fear
ing that the money may be lost 
or stolen.
Homecoming Memorial Service
Carnegie Techs first Homecom
ing since 1943 drew several hun
dred grads to the campus last 
week-end. Featured events were 
class dinners, the Homecoming 
luncheon, the football game with 
W. and J., the memorial services, 
and a large number of social 
events at the various fraternity 
houses.
Homecoming festivities began 
with a reception and tea given 
for the alumni by the Pittsburgh 
Womens Clan in the Carnegie 
Union Friday afternoon. The larg
est social event for all the alumni 
was the annual Homecoming 
Luncheon given Saturday in Ski
bo dining room.
IF Holds Decoration Contest 
Interfraternity Council spon
sored a fraternity decoration con
test held Saturday morning. Beta 
Sigma Rho Fraternity won the 
contest with its Spirit of 46 
display showing the figures of 
Washington and Jefferson and a 
Tartan under a * Welcome, 
Alumni sign. Second place was 
won by Alpha Tau Omega and 
third place by Theta Xi. Judges 
of the contest were Prof. Homer 
E. Sterling of the Printing de
partment, Prof. Robert D. Gregg 
head of the General Studies dept., 
and Prof. W. Frank Hitchens, head 
of the Architecture dept.
Class of 21 Most Active 
This homecoming featured es
pecially a gathering of the class
es graduating in the years ending 
in one and six, most of which 
classes had their own teas and 
luncheons. The most active class 
was the Class of 21 which held a 
luncheon and a dinner Saturday. 
The Class of 21 presented C. I. T. 
with a portrait of Professor 
Trinks, former head of the Me
chanical Engineering department, 
in an unveiling ceremony Sat.
The sororities held an open 
house for the alumni at Carnegie 
Union Saturday evening and the 
fraternities had dinner-dances and 
open house Saturday evening.
Although the continuation of 
the hotel strike forced the can
cellation of 60 hotel reservations 
being held for the alumni, Mr. 
J. L. Elliot, C. I. T. Alumni Sec
retary was able to find rooms in 
Pittsburgh for most of the alum
ni. The strike caused the cancella
tion of the Cabaret dance in the 
Hotel Schenley scheduled for Fri
day evening.

The Student Assembly Farce
Last Tuesdays student council assembly and much that pre
ceded it was an outstanding political farce.
For the first time in many years there were murmuring of 
action among the usually lethargic independents. Those who have 
long been waiting for this majority student element to show 
some interest in school affairs, felt optimistic.
But, when the independents, led by dorm men, proved 
divided, ineffective, and befuddled as usual, the optimism was 
soon shattered.
All the blame for this farce, however, should not go to 
the independents. It was actually heard that some fraternity 
men were convinced that, should the amendment fail, the in
dependents would take over council. Having done this, so the 
rumor goes, they could put the fraternity houses under control 
of student council with the result that the fraternities would 
be run just like dorms.
Would it be too ridiculous to remind these gullibles that 
student council has nothing to do with the dorms and certainly 
wouldnt have anything to do with the fraternity houses either?
The worst phase of this amendment farce was the assembly 
itself.
Perhaps Roberts Rules of parliamentary procedure have 
been revised since we last saw them, for the procedure of 
Tuesdays assembly had nothing in common with the traditional 
rules.
There is still the question in many minds whether the 
meeting was even called to order; however, there is no question 
concerning the discussion. It never had a chance.
Furthermore the balloting was haphazard because council 
used neither check lists nor printed ballots, both of which 
would have facilitated the vote and assured its accuracy.
In general the whole affair was confused and somewhat 
childish.
A great deal of this confusion could have been avoided had 
council allowed a two-week period to elapse between the an
nouncement of the proposed amendment and the balloting on it.
Such a lapse of time would be to the advantage of both 
parties and to the school in general.
Another assembly like last Tuesdays, with all its rumors, 
disorganization, foolishness, and discrepancies, might prove a 
disastrous mistake as well as a ridiculous farce.

Student Council
Fourth Meeting, 
October 30, 1946.
The meeting was called to or
der at 4:40 p. m.
Those present were: Misses Emmel, Hallas, Knott, Lisle, Ollett, 
and Price; Messrs. Engle, Farrahy, Franks, Garner, Dismukes, 
Kindi, Nutter, and Thurston. 
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Social Committee:
Miss Hallas indicated that the 
report for the Freshmen Dance is 
still incomplete, but that by the 
next meeting she hopes to make 
a full report of the dance.
Miss Hallas moved the Mortar 
Board be permitted to hold a Tea 
Dance on Wednesday afternoon,

Thistle Hall on Saturday, Novem
ber 9, 1946, for a dance.
Motion carried.
Publications Committee:
Mr. Engle reported that the 
Publications Comimttee had held 
a very successful dinner meeting 
on October 23 to discuss technical 
difficulties. A committee was ap
pointed of Mr. Meyers and all the 
business managers of the pub
lications to investigate the possi
bility of paying the people "*v'~
solicite advertising for the various 
publications.
Budget Committee:
Mr. Dismukes had several bud
gets to present, but Mr. Garner 
asked him to present them to the 
Executive Committee of Student 
Council for approval and to the 
entire Council at the next meeting. 
This was done because it was 
getting so late in the afternoon. 
Old Business:
Mr. Garner reported that the 
proposed amendment to the Stu
dent Council Constitution was 
passed by a % majority vote of 
the student body.
Messrs. Heckman, Wishnick, 
House, Tenplen, and Clover then 
asked that a new election be held 
because they believed the election 
that was held on October was 
unconstitutional.
After a discussion of this re
quest, Mr. Nutter moved that a 
new election be held because of 
the lack of publicity and the fact 
that the election held last Tues
day was unconstitutional.
There was no second to the mo
tion.
After another discussion, Mr. 
Nutter repeated his motion.
Again there was no second to 
the motion.

By Carl Klahr
In one sense the long drawn out 
trial of the Nazi war criminals 
was a good thing. When ten of 
them kept their date with the gal
lows a few weeks ago, a new con
ception of justice was ushered in. 
These men were not convicted of 
the conventional crimes  theft, 
murder, and treasonfor accord
ing to accepted legal forms they 
did not pillage or murder. They 
were executed for crimes against 
humanity. So, after thousands of 
years, civilization admits to itself 
that a man can murder and maim 
without taking into his hands a 
weapon. And, wonder of won
ders, it is finally recognized that 
you and I as individuals have 
rights as human beings that no 
one may violatenot even a 
proud, patriotic nation, hell-bent 
for conquest.
From another viewpoint, 
though, the War Crimes Trials
The Time Of Your Life
The perfect tribute that can be 
payed to a play is utter silence at 
the fall of a curtain . . . the 
audience is so spellbound by what 
has happened on the stage that it 
takes several seconds for them to 
realize that it was only make be
lieve. This stamp of approval was 
givenand justly soto the stag
ing of William Saroyans The 
Time of Your Life at the Little 
Theatre this week. It is one of 
the best productions that this 
writer hag had the pleasure of 
seeing at Carnegie Tech.
The show, like most of Saroyans 
works, is a bit puzzling at first. 
Set in a disreputable waterfront 
honkytonk near the Embaracdero 
of San Francisco, it brings to life 
a rather odd assortment of people. 
Streetwalkers and cops wander in 
and out; derelicts rub elbows with 
slumming society folks; an aspir
ing comedian pals around with a 
starved pianist; and in front of 
this confusing background move 
the main characters, which in 
themselves are quite unusual.
And yet, in spite of this ap
parent confusion, the moral of the 
play is very simpleand it is its 
very simplicity that makes it so 
difficult to understand. To put it 
in Saroyans own words: In the
time of your life, liveso that in 
that good time there shall be no 
ugliness or death for yourself or 
any life your life touches. Seek 
goodness everywhere, and when it 
is found, bring it out of its hiding 
place and let it be free and una
shamed ...
The Time of Your Life is pri
marily a play of moods, and this 
has been brought out magnifi
cently by the direction of Henry 
Boettcher and the sets designed 
by Albert Herschong. Most of the 
time the action consists of several 
simultaneous scenes, but the 
whole is integrated so masterfully 
that everything fits into place like 
the pieces of a puzzle. It is hard 
to describe how the subsidiary 
characters change constantly from 
complete immobility to subdued 
activity or prominence, and how 
this is blended and timed to per
fection. The manw touches which 
give the production its excellence 
must be seen to be appreciated 
the beautiful fade out of the scene 
in Kittys room; the monologue of 
the Arab, with Krupps question: 
What did he say last week? 
breaking the emotional surge as 
just the right time; the subsequent 
harmonica playing, one of the 
[Continued on page 4]
were inane and ridiculous To 
argue about the guilt of these 
dastards is to doubt the evidence 
ones own eyes have seen. In fact, 
these trials may actually encour
ag potential world-wreckers t 
feel secure in the protection of 
petty legalisms. It is the truth 
that the suffering of millions of 
innocent people was beyond hu
man understanding; yet the War 
Crimes Tribunal balances it 
against the execution of ten mangy 
curs. Try to imagine your wife 
or husband, your parents, brothers, 
and sisters, starving before your 
eys, while you begrudge yourself 
every piece of potato peel you eat. 
While you slink in fr through 
the streets, seventeen, year old 
soldiers use. you for target prac
tice for Sheer fun. Finally, a con
centration camp where the Victims 
fight among each other like wild 
beasts for scraps of food; then, the 
day you are packed into a boxcar 
floored with lime which eats into 
your bare feet till death or mad
ness offers relief. Such suffering 
cap neither be easily outweighed 
not easily forgotten.
During the war a favorite story 
of conquered Europe ran like this: 
The war ended and Hitler was 
brought to Paris (or Amsterdam 
or Warsaw, depending on where 
the story was told) for a reckon
ing. After much argument it was 
decided to burn him at the stake, 
bt, to give everyone an oppor
tunity to behold the torture, the 
fagots were to be lighted by a fuse 
which stretched for hundreds of 
miles in the country, that all might 
see it. Finally the great day 
came, and beady-eyed crowds 
liiied the main highway to watch 
the flame go by. Towards night
fall the flame had reached the 
execution square. Suddenly a 
stooped little old man, whose two 
sons had been executed for an act 
of sabotage they did not commit, 
rushed into the street and stamped 
out the flame. The crowd turned 
white with anger, and was on the 
verge of tearing him to pieces, 
when he lifted his arms, faced the 
populace, and said: Now let us
do it all over again. It takes 
incalculable suffering to generate 
such hate.
Confronted with this, I wonder 
about those few blind individuals

Freshmen Regulations
Dear Sir:
It is not hard to tell that an 
upperclassman is responsible for 
the editorial entitled R.I.P. in this 
weeks Tartan. I have never be
fore written an editorial, but nev
er before has such bitter feeling 
been aroused in me. Now I think 
that it is time for a lowly fresh
man to state a few of his views 
on the subject of freshmen regu
lations.
I admit that freshmen might 
have pushed their way through 
upperclassmen, but it was prob
ably in order that they could get 
to class on time. Have you ever 
viewed the steps at the main en
trance to Margaret Morrison? 
There are days when it is human
ly impossible for anyone to get 
past the array of our beloved so
phisticated upperclassmen who 
are draped on those steps, with 
cigarettes hanging out of the side 
of their mouths, having a juicy 
confab with some of their cronies. 
As for those friendly hellos be
ing returned by haughty stares 
... I ask, what friendly hellos 
are you talking about? My blood 
is really boiling at this point. I 
have yet to see an upperclassman 
exert even enough energy to smile 
at a freshman, let alone say hello. 
After greeting upperclassmen for 
the first few days that regulations 
were in effect I gave up and just 
adopted the indifferent attitude 
that they seem to take. Who likes 
to go around saying hello to these 
supreme beings and not be re
warded by at least a smile? I 
think that it was the hellos of the
freshmen which were returned by 
haughty stares of upperclassmen.
I dont think that any freshman 
would object to observing the reg
ulations set up for him if he got 
a little cooperation from the up
perclassmen. We also feel that 
they would help to establish 
school unity and spirit and we 
sincerely wanted to go into this 
business with a feeling of friend
liness existing between members 
of all the classes and not with the 
feeling of hostility that many 
freshmen noticed. If you think, 
and I refer to my learned col
league, that you were disappoint
ed by the outcome of the regula
tions, just ask any freshman how 
he feels. Chances are that he was 
doubly disappointed. W. J. S.
Constitution Change
Dear Mesdames:
During the past two weeks, 
there has been much talk about 
the proposed amendment to the 
constitution of the Student Coun
cil. The amendment, briefly 
stated, effects a change in the pro
portional representation from the 
colleges of Carnegie Tech. This 
amendment, if passed, would re
duce the representation on the 
Council from one representative 
per hundred students to one per 
150. The reason for the amend
ment, as put forth by the Council, 
is to reduce the size of that body 
so that it may operate more ef
ficiently.
Our reason for writing this let
ter is to explain to the students
where this issue stands at pres
ent. In the first place, it has be
come more than an attempt to 
diminish the size of the Council, 
It has become an attempt to keep 
the control of campus activities in 
the hands of the minority. If this 
is not so, why was the matter 
brought up in fraternity meetings 
at least a week before the amend
ment was proposed to the Coun
cil? This is but one of the ques
tions at hand.
Another question is, was the 
procedure used by Council in pass
ing this amendment in keeping 
with its constitution? The con
stitution states, This constitution 
may be amended by a favorable 
vote of three-fourths of the voting 
members of this Council ... 
(Article IX, Section 1, a.) [Ed.

there are 17 voting members on

Proteus Clan Asks 
Changes In Soc Rel
The Proteus clan at a meeting 
held last Thursday suggested to 
the school that languages be sub
stituted for social relations 
courses because these subjects are 
thought to be more important for 
physics majors than social rela
tions.
The Proteus clan, which is an 
organization of undergraduate 
students in the physic department, 
was organized last spring, partly 
to provide social activities, and 
principally to discuss the curric
ulum with the faculty. The meet
ings are also used as a period for 
giving constructive critcism to 
the members of the faculty who 
are invited to the meetings.
The only requirements for 
membership are that you must be 
either a sophomore, junior, or 
senior in the physics department.
The officers of the Proteus clan 
are: Allan McMahon, president; 
George Hinman, vice-president
Official Notice
There will be no classes for 
members of the C. I. T. stu

V aluablesRetained 
By L & F Dept.
The Lost and Found office has 
collected an assortment of mis
placed items. Five coats, three 
jackets, four hats, a pair of new 
basketball shoes, two Parker pens, 
wallets, and leather gloves are 
just some of the items that have 
been turned in.
A pair of glasses found in the 
car of the man who drove a Tech 
student to Patton, Pa., was sent 
to the office. The address, Dr. 
Frederick E. Arble, Carroltown, 
Pa., appears on the outside of the 
case.
There are an endless assortment 
of books: Structural Design in 
Steel, by Shedd; Applied Me
chanics, by Riggs; Treatment of 
Experimental Data, Worthing and 
Geffner; Steel Construction; and 
Volumes I and II of Land of Midian, by Richard Burton. These 
are just a few of the books. Any
one having lost any of these items 
may call at the Lost and Found 
office for them.
William Kapell will play the 
scintillating Rhapsody on a Theme 
of Paganini by the late Sergei 
Rachmaninoff. Under the direction 
of Dr. Reiner, the orchestra will 
present the first performance of 
Shostakovich's new Ninth Sym
phony, and another contemporary 
Russian work, Kabalevskys over
ture to Colas Breugnon, which the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
recorded for Columbia. Moussorgskys masterpiece, A Night on Bald 
Mountain, will complete the pro
gram.
Hockey Players 
Have Field Day
Judging from the number of 
girls that charged out on to the 
Cut at 4:30 on Wednesday, the 
appeal for hockey players must 
have reached sympathetic ears. 
Fifty or more of Techs coeds lin
ed up on the field and the battle 
for positions was on.
Battle Rages
Room-mates bludgeoned each 
other over the head for a chance 
at wing or guard, pledges hacked 
pieces of bone out of actives 
knees, friends pushed, tripped and 
shoved each other for a halfback 
or center post, but the goalie posi
tion seemed to be the target for 
most of the competition. The bat
tle raged long into the night. The 
next morning when Miss Allen 
went out to collect the bodies 
from the field, one lone survivor 
clung weakly to the goal cage. She 
is currently recovering in West 
Penn Hospital, and it is reported 
that she may be able to play in a 
few weeks. Several of the girls 
have received offers of contracts 
from the Pittsburgh Hornets, so 
think it over, girls; here is your 
big chance.
Schedule Arranged
Practices will continue at 4:30 
on Monday and Wednesday. Coach 
Allen has a lot of confidence in 
the team and has hinted that the 
rugged Scotch Lassies will not 
only defeat P. C. W., but will 
severely trounce the Phys. Ed. ma
jors from Pitt. There are still a 
few positions open and latecom
ers will be very welcome. Just 
come out to the field and the oth
ers will take care of you. We 
expect to see a turnout of the 
student body for both games; es
pecially to see the Plaid roll 
over the Blue and Gold from 
Pitt. The team members will be 
presented with 10 carat gold brass 
knuckles before the game.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1946
Drama Revieiv
[Continued from page 2] 
most gripping moments in the 
show; Harry breaking into a dance 
after his telephone call to his 
motherand so many others that 
it would take many columns of 
this size to give them full credit.
By far the best actor of both 
casts was James Schmitt as Joe. 
As a matter of fact, he was at 
all time so obviously in complete 
control of himself, and so near 
perfect, that his portrayal of Joe 
lacked the touch of human 
weakness which made Alvin Zeidmans performance of the same 
part paradoxically both the in
ferior and at times more agree
able one. From the theatrical point 
of view this of course is non
sense as Schmitt probably came 
as near achieving the standards of 
the CIT drama department as 
few students have ever done. But' 
to the layman this very excellence 
occasionally took' away the 
warmth so essential to the emo
tional attuning of audience and 
actor.
The two Nicks, Elek Hartman 
and Vincent OBrien, were both 
good, although the latter was su
perior, and the same can be said 
of Jack Klugmans portrayal of 
Tom as compared with that of 
Lester Stanford. Both Jack and 
Vine crossed that delicate bounda
ry between acting a part and mak
ing it come to lifeand this was 
also very true of Mary Elizabeth 
Kane in the part of Kitty. Her 
dream of home was especially 
good.
Among the minor characters 
there was so much quality that 
this enumeration will look almost 
like the complete list of players. 
Thomas OMalley was outstanding 
as the dancing comedian Harry, 
whom he enacted in both casts 
it is hard to say whether he ex
celled in acting or dancing. By far 
the funniest bit in the show was 
Sada Thompsons brief but im
pressive entry as Nicks Mother. 
Spouting Italian at an incredi
ble rate, she breezed on and off 
the set like a rather voluminous 
whirlwind, and received a big 
hand at all the performances. 
Nicholas Handgis, Arab, the Krupp
of Dave Krantz and the McCarthy 
of Wilford Thunhurst were excel
lent, as was Jacqueline Vlaskamps 
competent handling of the ex
tremely difficult bit of Mary L. 
Both William Myers and Ernest 
Motyl were most satisfactory as 
Kit Carson, the former weaken
ing his performance by hamming it 
for a few minutes after his en
trance, and the latter by the un
fortunately youthful pitch of his 
voice. Robert Cole deserves praise 
for his underplaying of Blick, in 
the other cast far too villanious 
a villain to be plausible.
Instrumental in the success of 
the play was the excellent music, 
composed and played off stage 
by George Wood and Joseph Dove. 
The latters accordion solo, sup
posedly played by the Arab, was 
one of the highlights of the show
Amid this abundance of quality 
the few weak spots of the produc
tion went by almost unseen. No
ticed but soon forgotten were such 
relatively unimportant items as 
the bad fading of the lights at 
Fridays matinee, the obvious 
playing of music in the pinball 
machine at stage right from a 
loudspeaker on stage left, a few 
poor performances by minor cha
racters, the inconsistency of Joes 
physical handicap, and the awk
ward position of the Society Lady 
who was almost completely ob
scured by Joe to any one in the 
center of the audience.
In spite of these deficiencies, 
however, The Time of Your Life 
was an outstanding production.
Only lack of space and of com
plimentary adjectives prevents 
this review from praising it and 
the individual performances for

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
TECH SPORTS
W&J Defeats Tartans 48-0 
Before Homecoming Crowd
Cooper of W. & J. making long gain. Tech players are: Pappafava 
(17), Maley (35), Highberger (96) and ORourke (42).
The Washington and Jefferson 
iootball team put the damper on 
Homecoming proceedings at Car
negie Tech last Saturday when 
they whipped an outclassed Tartan eleven, 48-0. A crowd, of 10,000 
saw the encounter. ,
Before the game, Techs re
nowned Kiltie Band led the audi
ence in a tribute to the war dead
Love At First Sight!
of the two schools. The band, 66 
strong, thrilled the crowd with an 
exhibition which none present 
will forget for some time.
The question of the day as far 
as football was concerned was, 
Could Tech stop Dan Towler, W. 
and J.s star fullback? Towler 
soon gave notice that he was not 
to be denied when he led his 
mates to a touchdown in the first 
four minutes of the ball game. 
Tech had received the kick-off 
and had garnered two first downs 
through the efforts of Highberger 
and ORourke. However, the Tar
tans then committed the first of 
many fumbles and the Presidents 
took over on their own 43. Towler 
carried to the Tech 24 in two 
plays and went over- from the 
Tech 2 after three more plays.
The Skibos were unable to gain 
following the kick-off and High
berger got away a booming punt 
which was returned to the Tech 
43 by Heberling. The Tartan line 
rose up to keep the Prexies from 
going farther and Carnegie took 
over on its 30. Unable to gain, 
Highberger dropped back to kick. 
The pass from center was low and 
Sam elected to run. He took off 
around right end and picked up a 
first down on the Tech 46.
On the next play, Davis inter
cepted Wilsons short pass and 
outraced the entire Tech team to 
go 50 yards for the score. The 
visitors were not content with this 
and kept right on rolling. Follow
ing another nice punt by High
berger, they worked the ball to 
the Tech 42. From here Towler 
set sail again and broke into the 
clear for another score. The quar
ter ended with W. and J. on top,
The Wash-Jeff second team 
took over, but could do little 
against the Tech line. Twice the 
Prexies were stopped deep in 
Tech territory and twice they got
the ball again' on Tartan fumbles. 
In the waning moments of the 
quarter, Highberger kicked out on 
the Tech 44. Three W. and J. 
passes failed, but on fourth down, 
and with just seconds to go in the 
half, Towler hit Jenner with a 
pass on the Tech 2 and the latter 
stepped over for the score.
The second half was only a con
tinuation of the first. The visitors 
took the kick-off and went straight 
down the field for another touch
down, Towler scoring on an 18- 
yard maneuver through center.
A few plays later, the Towler to 
Jenner combo clicked again and 
put the ball on the Tech 12, from 
which point Walt Cooper barged 
over for the score. Tech made a 
come-back at this point and drove 
to the W. and J. 20 before a pass 
was intercepted.
The final tally came in the 
fourth period on a 40-yd. jaunt by 
Borland. Lineups.

Harriers Lose 
First Match
In one of the closest meets in 
recent years, the Skibo Harriers 
last Wednesday lost to an almost 
equal Pitt team by a count of 
29-26. Running against the tough
est opposition they have yet en
countered Halfertys Harriers 
pulled a near upset on a favored 
Panther outfit. Ed Sudzini, prob
ably one of the most outstanding 
runners in the Eastern District 
took the meet in the fastest time 
in more than nine years. Bill 
Beamer, Tartan Captain, cracked 
twenty-five minutes to score sec
ond. It was Pitt and Tech right 
down the line with Camp, third, 
followed by Davies, A. Biggenhoe, Rotzler, Wilson, Cockerell, 
Benya, and B. Bidenhoe.
Sudzini, Pitt ace, built up a 
lead and was never overtaken. His 
ability to run the steep hills on 
the course cannot be matched by 
many of the district runners. Tech 
runs Westminster this Saturday 
and then rests until the big A.A.U. 
on the twenty-third of November. 
The Tartan team is proving to be 
one of the strongest teams that 
Tech has put on the cinder paths 
in many years.

Intramural 
Roundup
Intramural touch football en
tered its final week yesterday 
with some of the most important 
games yet to be played. Last 
weeks competition featured the 
T. X.s clinching the National 
League crown, the Tau Delts up
setting the Beta to put the PiKAs 
out in front of the American race, 
and the Delts sharing honors with 
FPHA-2 in the Federal.
The T. X.s unleashed a barrage 
of passes, the like of which has 
not been seen on the cut all sea
son, to trounce the undefeated 
Kilroy A. C. by a decisive 29-16 
count. Kaelin, the T. X. left end, 
sparked the attack by snagging 
three long passes in the first half.
Kilroy showed little life before 
the second half when their lateral 
pass offense finally began to click. 
It produced a pair of TDs in the 
third stanza and enabled them to 
bring the score to read 29-13. Kil
roy threatened during the entire 
fourth quarter but failed to pro
duce more than first downs.
The most exciting contest of the 
week was the battle between those 
traditional rivals, the Beta Sigs 
and Tau Delts. The Beta Sigs, 
previously undefeated, fell vic
tims to the Tau Delts in the clos
ing seconds of the game as Bud
dy Yorkin grabbed a perfect pass 
from Sherm Cohen and stepped 
over the double stripe for a 12-7 
victory.
The Beta Sigs were trailing 7-1 
with two minutes to play; they 
made it first down on the Tau Delt 
8-yard line; a pass to Stan Kohn 
followed and the score was tied. 
The Beta Sigs kicked-off, and on 
the next play Yorkin galloped to 
the winning touchdown.
In the National League Kilroy 
swamped the Betas 16-0. The T. 
X.s slaughtered the Phi Kaps 22- 
7 with Kaelin stepping into the 
endzone four times. The T. N. T.s 
forfeited to the Phi Kaps, and the
D. U.s came from behind in the 
final quarter to set down the 
Betas 11-7.
There were three games in the 
Federal League. The boys from the 
barracks remained undaunted as 
Zenoni grabbed Fitzgeralds pass 
in the endzone to hand the Sigma 
Nus their second defeat. The 
score: FPHA-2-7, Sigma Nu2.

The Phi Kappa Football Tro
phy committee has announced 
that the trophy which is to be giv
en to the most valuable player of 
the 1946 Tartan squad is to be 
presented as a memorial to their 
fraternity brother, Joseph S. Pash.
Joe Pash graduated in Me
chanical Engineering in Decem
ber, 1942, and entered active duty 
with the Navy in February, 1943.
He served as lieutenant, (j. g.) 
TJSNR aboard the submarine U. S.
S. Lagarto. The Lagarto was re
ported ovedue after setting out 
for the Tokyo area, and all 
aboard her were declared 
missing in action. This 
disaster brought to an end 
the career of one of the 
hardest fighting footballers 
who ever wore the colors 
of Carnegie Tech.
One of his coaches, Wal
ter Burns, said of Joe, one 
of the fastest players we 
ever had on the varsity 
football squads. But he 
who never asked quarter 
even though he weighed 
only 155 pounds. Joe was 
a little guy playing in the 
days when Tech had big 
football squads. Bue he 
never let his size enter into 
the picture when he was 
stacked up against the big ones. 
Everyone who had seen Joe play,|j* 
those who were on the squad with 
him, all were impressed by the 
fight the little guy showed 
when on the gridiron.
He was a football player when 
Tech carried to the gridiron the
 tradition of coming through at 
least once a year with a major 
upset. It is a widely known fact 
that no team, no matter how much 
the odds were in their favor, could 
ever be sure of an easy game with
Tech. This tradition produced 
what is considered to be one of 
the major upsets in all football 
history when, in 1926, the Tartans 
defeated the Irish r Notre Dame.
That was the day that the fam
ed Knute Rockne was so con
fident of victory that he was at
tending the game in Chicago 
scouting the one team that was 
given a chance to beat the Irish 
that year. The Tartans fought to 
win that game.
It is that fighting spirit of Joe
Joe Pash
Pash that we would like to see 
again whenever the Tartans take 
the field. No matter how badly we 
might have been beaten, we want 
them to be in fighting to win the 
next one. We want the school to 
be behind our players; we want 
the alumni to be behind the school. 
If nothing but his fighting spirit 
is to remain of the glory that 
the Tartans of the past knew, we 
will have won some of that for 
which we are fighting.

man race. Take the case of that 
mainstay of the Senate, Robert A. 
Taft of Ohio. This gentleman ex
pressed regret at the execution of 
the ten Nazis, because the trials 
were not legal enough for him. 
Not legal enough for him! Let 
him take a plane to Europe to visit 
the concentration camps and the 
crematories.
Senator Taft, with his legalisms, 
it seems, would not help his neigh

would trespass on his neighbors

TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
Methinks Bill Beamer is one of the greatest natural runners I 
have seen. The captain of the present Tech Cross-Country team 
ran a magnificent race against Pitt last Wednesday and, although he 
ran second to Pitts ace, Sudzini, gave evidence that the coming A.A.U. 
encounter with the best in the district is going to be a neck and neck 
battle all the way. The Sudzini-Beamer rivalry is nothing new. The 
two came to grips last spring twice in the mile run. Both times 
Bounding William came out on 
top. In fact, Beamer was the sen
sation of the track world in these 
parts last spring. With hardly any 
training, The Rapid One stepped 
out and won his first meet. The 
next time out, he lopped off ten 
seconds from his previous time 
and won again. Thereafter, he 
kept chopping large hunks from 
his times and wound up the sea
son running about 4:30 for the 
distance. With all the training he 
is getting in cross-country, hell 
be the man to beat in the mile 
this coming spring and I wouldnt 
be a bit surprised if he turns in 
a performance under 4:20.
All those, who are quarterback
ing Tech football games from the 
sidelines and griping about how 
things are going burn me up.
Theres just one thing to remem
ber. The boys who are playing 
want to win as badly as anyone 
else, and whats more, theyre do
ing something about it! Techs 
cheering section strikes me as be
ing a bunch of fair-weather fans.
The time for cheering is not only 
when things are going right, but 
also when theyre going wrong.
Here comes something which 
has been on my mind for quite a 
while. Its a tale of woe. The 
soccer team practices till 6:00 ev
ery night. By the time the boys 
take a shower and get over to the 
Skibo, its 6:30 and the line is 
tremendous. The boys have been 
complaining about running until 
theyre poohed in practice, then 
going over and fighting that line.
At first they asked for meal tick
ets, but this being Carnegie Tech, 
that ws ruled out immediately.
Then tl.ey asked to be allowed to 
eat with the football team and 
pay whatever the meals cost the 
school. Skibo couldnt see it. They 
agreed to save some of the meat 
for the soccer team, but still the 
team had to fight that line. Buddy 
Overend did all he could about 
the situation, but Skibo officials 
gave him the soft soap and said 
they were sorry but they couldnt 
do anything about it. Heres my 
suggestion. As long as there is 
enough meat now, why not save 
10 portions of it and serve it to 
the soccer team (making them 
pay for it, of course) in the same 
place the football team is served 
(where there is no line). It isnt 
going to kill anybody to carry one 
pan of meat 10 yards.
Forgotten Man of the Year is 
Arnold Tucker of the Army foot
ball team. I dont see how they 
can exclude Tucker from the AllAmerican team this year, Lujack 
or no Lujack. Those who saw the 
Army-Navy game last year realize 
that it was Tucker, and not 
Blanchard or Davis who won that 
game. Twice this year, it has been 
Tucker all the way in giving 
Army the punch when they need
ed it most.
Seeing the band spell Hello 
with a rolling O Saturday 
brought back memories of the 
time when a Big Ten band did the 
same thing. The only trouble was 
they got the O on the wrong 
end. The crowd got quite a charge 
when it saw a large O Hell.
Toemen Poisoned By Allegheny
Coach Pat Connors soccer team 
took the field twice last week and 
had to be content with a split. 
Allegheny invaded the Tartan 
home grounds Tuesday afternoon 
and walked off with a 1-0 deci
sion. Thiel was the attraction at 
the Forbes Street field last Friday. 
The Skibos added another to their 
string of victories over the Thiel 
eleven as they squeezed out a 1-0 
decision.
Tuesdays game was the exact 
reverse of last years encounter 
between these two teams. In 1945, 
the Tartans journeyed to Meadville, scored an early goal and 
clung to their lead to win, 1-0. 
This time it was the Gators who 
came through with the tally in the 
early stages and staved off a late 
rally by Tech to emerge victori
ous.
Allegheny went straight down 
the field to register the counter 
when the ball took a queer hop 
in front of the Tech goal and the 
visitors centre-forward banged it 
through the uprights.
The teams changed goals to 
start the next period and the 
Techites continued to drive to
ward the opponents goal, but to 
no avail. During the second half, 
both teams had numerous scoring 
opportunities. However the de
fenses of the two clubs were air
tight and neither side could punch 
the ball past the last white line.
The Thiel eleven arrived Friday 
afternoon with visions of aveng
ing last years twin defeats at the 
hands of the Tartans. The Skibos, 
however, scored quickly, and 
clung to their slim margin to rack 
up their second victory in five 
starts.
The muddy field made the going 
rough for both teams and provid
ed the crowd with plenty of
laughs. The encounter see-sawed 
back and forth at the start until, 
midway in the opening period, the 
Tartans were awarded a comer 
kick. Len Kroko, who was shifted 
from his normal halfback slot to 
the line for the game, booted the 
ball toward the goal. Cloyd Mellott, Tech captain, got his crani
um on the sphere and lofted it 
into the center where Don Hart, 
center-forward, banged it home 
for the only score.

Once obscure laboratory 
chemical now finding 
wide use in industry
Sulfamic acid, which for 
years was merely another 
obscure laboratory chemical, 
is today being produced in 
carload quantities for a con
stantly growing list of uses 
because of a discovery 
made by a Du Pont chemist.
Believing that urea could 
be sulfonated to give a prod
uct which might have com
mercial utility, the chemist 
treated urea with fuming 
sulfuric acid. The reaction 
was exceedingly violent, and 
it appeared that decomposi
tion had taken place to give ordi
nary ammonium sulfate. However, 
the chemist noted that the white 
precipitate which had formed did 
not dissolve rapidly in water as am
monium sulfate should, and further 
investigation proved that he had 
obtained sulfamic acid.

scarcely known chemical, and an in
tensive study of its chemical and 
physical properties has led to its 
development for a wide variety of 
industrial uses.
First Industrial Applications
The salts of sulfamic acid are being 
used extensively as flame-proofing 
agents. Highly compatible with cellu
lose, ammonium sulfamate is unique 
among fire retardants in that it does 
not cause stiffening or otherwise ad
versely affect the hand or feel of 
textiles and paper.
Another outstanding use for am
monium sulfamate is as a weed killer 
for the control of poison ivy, rag
weed, and a variety of noxious an
nuals. Its effect on poison ivy is un
matched by any other product.
One of the most important indus
trial applications for sulfamic acid is 
based on the fact that it reacts quan
titatively and very rapidly with ni
trous acid. This has led to its wide 
use in eliminating the excess nitrite 
employed in diazotization reactions
for dye and colored pigment 
manufacture.
Soluble in Water and 
Non-hygroscoplc
Sulfamic acid isastrong acid, 
and despite the fact that it 
is exceedingly soluble in wa
ter, it is a solid non-hygroscopic, non-volatile material 
which has found application 
as a laboratory titrimetric 
standard. Additional infor
mation will be found in the

Say! Hay, Not Hey, Is Cheap 
But Some Say Straws Cheaper
Hay is one of the most import
ant items used on the earth. Most 
people know it as common dried 
grass and quite a few others know 
it as a word Hey, to attract 
someones attention. Getting 
around to Hay as written in books 
for knowledge Seekers, we find 
that Hay is stems and leaves of 
grasses and other plants, cut and 
dried for fodder. The chief grass
es grown for this important crop 
in the United States are timothy, 
alfalfa, and clover. There are 
many different kinds of Hay, and 
each has its own definite use, ex
cept when someone gets his signals 
crossed and uses one kind when 
he should be using another. Mow
ing occurs when the grass is in 
full flower, at which time the 
plants contain the largest amount 
of sugar and other soluble ma
terials. Just as soon as'it is dry, 
it is staeked to prevent fermenta
tion. Some of the uses in every 
day life would be for feeding 
animals of the ungulate species, 
hayfever (an irritation known to 
many), getting acquainted with 
the farmers daughter, or for just 
getting acquainted.
When hay is used for just get
ting acquainted, it involves a few 
technicalities. First of all, a hay 
burner must be used as a prime 
mover and the old gray mare 
should fill the bill. Then directly 
behind must be a chassis consist
ing of a flat framework with a 
wheel at each corner, four total, 
making it easily propelled when 
being pulled. This hay is loaded 
into its bed in varying heights, 
depending on the amount that one 
chooses to use. Now if everyone 
is ready, well all pile on for a 
merry ride around the country
side.
Were still riding, folks, all the 
way to Norton, Nebraska, where 
we have the largest prairie hay

First Evening School Dance 
Saturday, November 30
Tech lads and lassies lend us your ears! Your Student Council 
has arranged to start Techs evening school social activitiesV off with 
a bang! It is just what you have been waiting for and even more. 
The first social event of the season will begin with a Thanksgiving 
Dance on November 30 in the new remodeled Thistle Hall here at 
Carnegie Tech.
Here is the first highlight of the event! Your social chairman 
informs us that we expect to feature a popular local band for that 
big evening. Keep watching the Plaid, Techites, because the name 
of the band will appear in the next issue and you are sure to be 
pleasantly surprised.
The second highlight is sure to please young and old, Engineering 
and Art students alike. The price for this all-time Thanksgiving en
tertainment is only fifty cents. Naturally, we all raise a skeptical eye
brow and with the help of our im
agination we wonder why and 
how such a dance as this with a 
popular local band could have as 
its admission price only fifty cents. 
The facts are as follows: Your
Evening School Student Council is 
sponsoring the larger part of the 
entertainment and refreshment 
and the fifty cents is only a small 
portion of the actual cost.
The third highlight is certainly 
not to be overshadowed by the 
other two just mentioned. This 
gala affair, is not restricted to 
evening students at Carnegie Tech, 
remember.
Lets all take advantage of the 
great opportunity our Student 
Council is offering us to become 
acquainted with our fellow even
ing school students. This being 
the first social event of the sea
son, everyone should be there to 
welcome it to a grand start and to 
have an enjoyable time.
Tickets can be secured from 
any member of the Student Coun
cil, Plaid Staff, Social Committee, 
or from Mr. McKelway in the 
Evening School Office.
Lamplighters 
New Campus Club
Something interesting to note 
about evening students is the way 
they always manage to get to
gether no matter how long the in
terval of separation may be. An 
organization proving this is tho 
new Lamplighter Club which is 
still in the formative stage on 
Carnegie Techs campus. The 
only day students who are eligible 
for membership in the Lamp
lighters are those who formerly 
attended evening classes at Tech.
This club is sponsoring its first 
social event of the year Novem
ber 10 at the Carnegie Union. H. 
E. Johnson is the Chairman of the 
planned houseparty, and Mr. and 
Mrs. McKelway are to be the 
chaperons for the evening.
We like the spirit behind this 
organization and extend to it sin
cere wishes for success in its at
tempt to bring together all for
mer evening students who are 
now attending day classes.

Student Council. Those voting 
members voting in the affirmative 
were: The Misses Lisle, Hallas,
Cook, Ollett, Emmel, and Price; 
Messrs. Dismukes, Engle, Thurs
ton, Yorkin, and Franks. This to
tals eleven out of seventeen which 
is not a favorable vote of threefourths of the voting members. 
However, in the vote Messrs. Farrahy and Tritle were considered 
eligible to vote replacing the vot
ing members not present. Messrs. 
Farrahy and Tritle were elected 
to the Council as non-voting mem
bers. We challenge Student 
Council to produce any official 
record indicating that non-voting 
members are permitted to vote on 
any question whatsoever. We re
fer readers to Article II, Section 
1, b.
Another question which has 
arisen is: is President Gamer a 
voting member of Council? Arti
cle II, Section 9 says, a quorum 
shall consist of three-fourths of 
the voting members of the Coun
cil including the President. Ar
ticle II, Section 4b says the rep
resentative elected president shall 
thereafter vote only in case of 
tie. Mr. Garner was elected as 
a voting member from the college 
of Engineering. Therefore, we 
maintain that he is a voting mem
ber. He is President and there
fore can vote only in case of a tie. 
Anyone who can vote must neces
sarily be a voting member.
Another question concerns the 
publicity given the proposed 
amendment. On Tuesday, Octo
ber 22, 1946, notice appeared in 
the Tartan that a General Assem
bly would be held in the Little 
Theatre, Fine Arts, for the stu
dents to vote upon this amend
ment. The Council voted on the
Intramurals

The Dets and the Kappa Sigs did 
all their scoring in the second 
and third periods as the Delts pull
ed down one more pass than their 
rivals to give them an 18-11 win. 
The third was a massacre rather 
than a game. The A. T. O.s ran 
up the biggest score of the year 
to drop the Musical Maulers 31-2.
The D. U.s lost a close one to 
the T. N. T.s 9-4. The two teams 
matched each other in first downs, 
but the T. N. T.s alertness paid 
off. The D. U. safetyman knocked 
down a pass in his endzone only 
to have Katsafranas, the T. N. T. 
quarterback scoop it up before it 
hit the dirt.
FPHA-1 forfeited all its games 
to its American League opponents. 
The only other contest in the 
American League besides the Tau 
Delt-Beta Sig upset was a 17-3 
decision over the Dorm Combine 
by the SAEs.

amendment Wednesday, October 
23, 1946, the day after the notice 
appeared in the Tartan. Article 
IV, Section 1 states, It shall be 
the duty of the Student Council 
to publish notice in the Tartan of
all actions affecting the entire 
Student Body immediately after 
such actions are taken.
The purpose of this discussion 
is to arouse interest in a topic 
vital to the student body. For
the past few years the minority 
group has controlled the Council. 
They have kept control because of 
a system whereby the election of 
representatives is pre-determined 
and men are told how to vote.
This system has no place in a de
mocracy.
Sincerely yours,
Dick Heckman
