Arts Ball 
Cancelled
Plans for the Beaux Arts ball, 
formal dance sponsored by the 
Beaux Arts, honorary of Fine 
Arts, has been cancelled, accord
ing to B. Kenneth Johnstone, di
rector of the college.
The ball, which was discon
tinued during the war? was for
merly held every two years, so 
the new plans will conform with 
this tradition. Two reasons were 
given for the decision. First, no 
date was reserved for- the dance 
in the original school calendar.
Second, when date and budget 
were approved, it was so late in 
the term that there was insufficient 
time to make proper preparations 
without excessive cutting of 
classes by members of the various 
committees. In view of these facts, 
it was decided to postpone the 
dance until next year.
The Beaux Arts honorary com
mittee has decided to support 
Form, the Fine Arts publication, 
and to plan lectures and exhibits 
for the latter part of the semes
ter.

Trying to Reach 
Off-Campus Firms
Now that the Carnegie Techni
cal has recovered completely from 
its wartime difficulties and has 
become one of the four under
graduate engineering publications 
accepted by the Library of Con
gress, its circulation department is 
attempting to promote sales of 
the* magazine to people and or
ganizations beyond the limits of 
the campus.
The purpose of this new cir
culation drive is to permit the 
magazine to fulfill one of its pri
mary aims, that of acting as a 
calling card for the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology. By dem
onstrating to graduate engineers 
and to leaders of industry the 
quality of work done at the col
lege and the worth of the men 
who accomplish this work, the 
Technical hopes to assist in the 
general program of improving 
the value of the label: B.S., Car[Continued on page 3]
Typists Wanted

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL. All 
those interested in working 
for either magazine should 
report to the TECHNICAL of
fice at 4:30 Tuesday or at any 
time Saturday morning or aft
ernoon. Both secretarial and 
straight typing specialists are 
needed. Work will be assigned

interest and available time. 
Work can be done either at 
the TECHNICAL office or at 
home.

Editors Armchair
Here We Go Again
As Boos last column implied, there is a new editorial we 
this week. Well do our best to keep up the good work started 
by our predecessor. Said she  . . . the ridiculous and outdated 
dictatorship in the womens dormitory system. And she was 
right.
The Constitution and Rules of the Student Government 
Association of Womens Dormitories states that the Association, 
through the Dormitory Council, shall have jurisdiction with the 
advice of the Assistant Dean (of Women) over the conduct of 
the students living in dormitories ... It shall have the power to 
enforce penalties which the Council shall determine, with the 
exception of suspension and expulsion; these may be recommend
ed by the Council to the Assistant Dean (of Women) and to be 
enforced must be approved by the Dean of Students, by the 
Director of the College concerned, and by the President of 
the Institute.
Dorm Council Authority Pre-empted by the Dean of Women
This would seem to give the girls the right to regulate their
--------;rs as j-kgy deem reasonable, if this grant of power were
good faith. That it is not may be seen from the large 
3f cases where infractions of the regulations are not 
reported at all to the Dormitory Council, but are acted on di
rectly by the Dean of Women. Moreover, infractions of rules 
which do not appear in the Councils list of regulations are de
clared by House Mothers, and penalties applied to the students 
by the Dean of Women, or her delegate.
* ....We feel that the system as set up in the Constitution is
reasonable and workable, if only the school authorities would 
permit the Council its rightful jurisdiction as stated in that 
Constitution.
A number of the features of the program in operation seem 
to us to be undesirable, some of * which we feel to be Dorm 
Councils responsibility, but most of which are due to school 
pressure.
First is the statement that all activities of Council shall 
be kept within the Association. We feel that there would be 
fewer infractions of the regulations if the men at Carnegie 
knew the rules applying to the dormitory girls they date, and 
knew the penalties for infractions of the rules. Certainly most 
activities of the Council should be kept confidential, especially 
cases brought before Council, but utter secrecy savors of the 
dictatorship mentioned in last weeks editorial.
College Women or College Children?
On reading the regulations, we get the impression that the 
school thinks of dormitory girls as children, and freshman girls 
as babes in arms, to be treated as such. Some examples are the 
rules: No keys may be taken from the dormitory over vacations; 
if a girl is one minute late returning to the dormitory she 
receives a warning; if she forgets to sign out she receives a 
warning; she is forbidden to take a bath or shower after 1:30 
a, m. without permission of the House Mother; and similar trivia.
Our opinion is that a girl who is attending classes at a 
college is old enough to assume some responsibility and to 
live her own life. Certainly regulations are necessary to en
able the girls to gain a mature attitude without first leading 
a completely wild life, but these regulations need not be so 
arbitrary and should be left more to the discretion of the Dor
mitory Council, Tather than residing in the absolute power of 
the Dean of Women.
Interpretation Makes or Breaks the System
Present operation of the system has disadvantages not only 
in the regulations themselves, but also in the way in whioh the 
House Mother iBterpr# regulation*. For example, some

ON STAGE
S. & S. BUoii
Do you like excitement? Do you 
want to have fun? Then try out 
for Scotch and Soda.
Dramatic tryouts will be held 
at the Carnegie Union on Satur
day, February 22, at 1:00 p. m. If 
you can act, dash over; if you 
dont know whether you can act, 
dash over and find out; if you 
cant act, dash over anyway.
The final dancing tryouts for 
Scotch and Soda will be held on 
Saturday at 11:30 a. m. in Thistle 
hall. There is still a great need 
for tall, dark, and handsome men 
Scotch and Sodas Rock N Riot 
has the girls to match them. All 
students who were at the first 
two tryouts, and those accepted 
next Saturday morning should be 
present in costume at 1:00 p.m. 
promptly in Thistle hall on Sat
urday for the first dancing re
hearsal.
The publicity committee will 
hold meetings every Tuesday af
ternoon at 4:30 in FA 107. Any
one interested in writing publici
ty releases, planning stunts, and 
painting posters can still join the 
staff.
The search for male and female 
singing leads will be continued 
next Saturday at 1:00 p.m., in the 
radio room of Fine Arts. Rock N 
Riot needs both male and female 
singers of all types: tenors and 
baritones, sopranos, altos, and 
just plain vocalists.
Dramats Have Cats
If you asked 'Whats the dream 
now, Kitty Duval? the answer 
would probably go something like 
this. I dream of a waterfall, of 
cream flowing into a gargantuan 
pitcher, with scallops and filet of 
sole forming an aromatic border 
which raises a tender fragrance to 
heavenand heaven, I dream of 
it is an infinity of soft wool 
bals.
Kitty Duval, in case youre in
terested, is white, with distinguished-looking black marks. She 
answers, as did her predecessor, to 
whistles, wolf calls, and cat calls. 
Her companion Mary L. is tigerstriped and has been called very 
fast. But since they are sixweek-old kittens Im afraid 
theyre still too young to date.
Theyre the young uns that the 
drama department is using in You 
Cant Take It With You. Their 
background is a frustrated exist
ence in the MMCC basement, but 
their future is going to be much 
happier- Alec Hartman claims 
Kitty Duval, and Ann 'Kelly 
Kennedy wants Mary L, The 
two young ladles a? now retldlng in McGill hall ai guests of 
Uiki Kally, a lophr------ .....n.
The Little Theatre resounded 
to more laughter in a few days 
of this week than in several of 
the preceding months combined. 
And most of it occurred in a brief 
period on Tuesday morning when 
George Wood presented In Rela
tive Time, or What Am I Doing 
In Heaven, written and produced 
by himself and directed by Mr. 
McCalmon.
Rarely has Carnegie Tech seen 
anything so witty, so sophisticat
ed, and so immensely amusing as 
this presentation. Produced as a 
term report for Professor Dawes 
class in History of Art and Ci
vilization, it is written about 
Aristophanes, ancient Greeces 
satiric and none too moral comic 
dramatist. Sent to Heaven upon 
his death, he is bored to distrac
tion by his fellow-saints, too 
bloody good to go to hell. He 
looks for someone to write the 
music for his plays, but for twen
ty centuries  two days, Relative 
Universal Time  he is unable 
to find anyone with his bawdy 
mind and his ability to laugh at 
anything. He auditions everyone 
Bach and Beethoven, Puccini, 
Wagner, and Sir Arthur Sullivan 
without success. But at last the 
search ends as Fats Waller swag
gers in, wondering, just like 
Aristophanes, what he is doing 
in heaven and why he is not 
where the boys are getting good 
and hot. They form a partner
ship, and together decide on the 
most deserving butts of their 
ridicule, William Saroyan and 
Eugene ONeill.
With George Wood as Aristo
phanes, Al Checco as Fats Waller, 
Elly Hovde, Jimmy Schmitt, and 
Al Heshong among the supporting 
cast, and Joseph Dove at the pi
ano, the play was such an incred
ible success that George Wood
Alcoholics Ahoy! Tell 
Your Tale, Win Dough
Like to win $200? Practically 
any Carnegie student should be 
able to write a prize-winning 
editorial on alcohol.
The Intercollegiate Association 
has announced an editorial con
test for college students on the 
general theme Outgrowing Alco
holic Culture.
If a Tech student misses the 
first prize (although this is very 
unlikely), he still has a chance to 
win one of two prizes of $50 each, 
or one of ten prizes of $20 each. 
As an added attraction,* the Inter
national Student, Association pub
lication, has offered to publish all 
acceptable contributions for a 
monthly award of $10.
There is gold in alcohol, so 
start writing before the rush.
rates as much criticism for not 
having presented things like this 
before as grateful praise for hav
ing done so now.
You Cant Take It With You
While there was a great deal of 
laughter as the Drama depart
ments regular presentation, You 
Cant Take It With You opened 
on Friday night, there could have 
been much more with the same 
actors and a better play. While a 
play like The College Widow is 
so outdated that its old-fashioned 
character is itself the main source 
of amusement, the much more re
cent work of Kaufman and Hart 
cannot do this, and yet is old 
enough to be stale.
Nevertheless, the play still has 
enough sparkle and, above all, 
so much excellent acting in this 
production to make it very enjoy
able to all who saw it. Al Checco, 
who on Tuesday had brought 
down the house as Fats Waller, 
starred this time as Granpqi Mar
tin Vanderhof. With the skill that 
can always be expected from him, 
he made the old mans eccentrici
ties seem plausible by accentuat
ing his wisdom and kindliness. 
He was ably supported by so 
many others in his cast that lack 
of space permits only a brief 
mention of the best performances: 
Ernie Motyl and Phillis Petrikin 
as the Sycamores, Dave Crantz as 
Mr. De Pinna, Dick Riebling and 
Ruth Pivirotto as Ed and Essie, 
the mad Russian of Les Stanford, 
and Judy Lambert in a brief but 
excellent appearance as the Grand 
Duchess.
In the other cast, Granpa Van
derhof was played very well by 
Bill Putch, and he too received 
excellent support. If after Col
lege Widow any further proof 
was needed that Lucy Seibert is 
an outstanding comic actress, this 
play furnished it, with her per
formance of Essie. Lois Wales 
played Alice with the right mix
ture of humor and romance, es
pecially in the love scene of the 
first act, and she was well assist
ed by James Long as Tony. The 
Sycamores of Mary Liz Kane and 
Al Seidman, Danny Franks as 
Mr. De Pinna, Helen Leerbergs 
Mrs. Kirby, and Elek Hartman as 
her husband, were the other high
lights in this cast.
Home of the Brave
Henry Weinsteins excellent 
production of his own adaptation 
of Home of the Brave deserves 
more mention than just a brief 
final paragraph. Presented in the 
Studio Theatre, with Mitch Agruss, Eddie Edmonds, Elek Hart
man, Vince OBrien, Carl Betz, and 
Bill Ross in the excellent cast, it 
ranks among the best productions 
of the year.

is sleeping with eggs, and theyre 
not even softboiled.
Jim, who is a senior printer, 
will graduate in May, 1947, with 
an average factor of 2.84. He is 
five feet eleven inches tall, has 
beautiful brown hair and a girl 
named Marie Schurko who is 
wearing his pin. Which takes care 
of all the vital statistics.
His most important job at 
school, besides studying of course, 
is being president of Student 
Council. He also belongs to Omicron Delta Kappa, senior mens 
honorary, the Student laison com
mittee, and, of course, his frater
nity, Theta Xi. He worked for a 
while in publications and ath
letics in 1941, but hasnt had time 
for them since then.
Jim was a staff sergeant and 
a radio operator in the Army. He 
was discharged February 19, 1946, 
and the next day returned to Car

In order to make this new cir

Officers Eleeted 
By Fraternities
The elections of new officers for 
the spring semester were held by 
most fraternities last week. The 
new administration for the D. U.s 
is Merle Westlake, president; 
Charles Duffet, vice-president; 
Robert McKee, treasurer; H. J. 
DeRolf, secretary; William Bar
ron, social chairman; Albert 
Sellke, house manager.
The Delts elected Thomas Farrahy, president; Gerald OBrien, 
vice-president; Arnold Christen
son, treasurer; William Watkins, 
recording secretary; Nick Reed, 
corresponding secretary.
For the PiKAs the new officers 
are Frederick Dolans, president; 
Donald Armour, vice-president; 
Ralph Snapp^ secretary; Robert 
Geiger, treasurer; Glen Ertell, 
house manager.
The SAEs chose Robert John
son, president; W. L. Dickerson, 
vice-president; Russell Klingensmith, treasurer; R. S. Bingham, 
steward; Edward Bonnett, social 
chairman.
Beta Sigma Rho is content with 
the present staff namely, Howard 
Gartner, chancellor; Milton Fried
man, vice-chancellor; Jay Levin[Continued on page 4]
work he should have began on 
February 1. Hes been here ever 
since, so the thing he wants most 
of all after graduation is a two 
weeks vacation.
Dick Storm wears a different 
sweater every day, well, Gar
ners clothes fad is bow ties, of 
which he owns an amazing col
lection, most of which are a trifle 
drab. Anyone who wants some
thing to go through council can 
probably facilitate it by buying 
him a rainbow colored Frank Si
natra.
But seriously, Jim worries 
about C.I.T. athletics, something 
he didnt think the school was in
terested in until they reactivated 
the Steffans Fund. He also thinks 
the school should make an effort 
to keep its department heads and 
experienced men, many of whom 
have left or are leaving for other 
schools.
Jim, who hails rrom Indianap
olis, Indiana, hasnt any definite 
plans after graduation, except 
getting a job up New England 
way. He wants to do management 
work of sorts in a printing job 
house.

The taste of the judges is as 
hard to fathom as usual in art 
exhibits. One painting, Marthas 
Rose, looks as if it were origin
ally destined for the Lena the 
Hyena contest. The first prize 
water color, Baiting Fighter 
Cocks, is a muddy red and black

Cano Magazine
[Continued from page 1]
Wright about the progress of the 
new magazine, was told:
The one thing really needed 
now is copy. We are looking for 
all types of poems, short stories, 
essays, reviews of recent dramas 
and books of note, and whatever 
your readers are doing in the way 
of experimental writing.
When asked if contributions 
were limited to just one school 
or to students of special English 
courses, the answer was an em
phatic no.
Cano is interested in anything 
good in the way of creative writ
ing done by an undergraduate of 
Carnegie Tech. All they have to 
do to submit their work is to place 
it in an envelope addressed to 
Features Editor, Cano, and slip it 
into the interschool mail slot at 
the Industries hall post office. If 
it is accepted, they will be notified 
and asked to check all corrections 
made in their work before it is 
published . If we cant use it, 
the Cano staff will take the re
sponsibility of returning the work 
to the author.
But by all means, write. Were 
on the lookout for that special 
piece of writing on which youve 
been working recently . Send it 
along and let others enjoy itin 
print.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Tartans Score First Against Opponents
Tartans Fall As Westminster ORCHIDS AND ANDYLINES 
Romps To Easy Victory, 76-46
Getting better with every game and sporting one of the'best rec
ords in the tri-state district, the Titans of Westminster College came 
to town to show the local residents their class last Saturday night. And 
just that they did as they overwhelmed our local court heroes by a 
score of 76-46.
Combining height with deadly passing and accurate shooting, the 
score was only close for the first few minutes. With the visitors scoring 
at will and the Tartan hoopsters 
having trouble finding the range,
Westminster pulled steadily ahead 
and by the end of the half the 
issue was no longer in doubt.
House Scores First 
Big Mel House opened the scor
ing for the evening with a pivot 
shot. McLhinney, -the visitors 
diminutive set shot artist, knotted 
the score with a clean two-hander from the side. Once again the 
Plaid took the lead as Katselas 
made good a charity toss. Jones 
of Westminster followed with a 
lay-up shot to put the visitors 
ahead, 4-3. Katselas retaliated by 
producing a fielder and a foul 
conversion, and the Skibos were 
ahead for the last time, 6-4. Led 
by McLhinney and Chet Demfoliski, the tall Titans tore the 
Tartan defense apart to take a 
lead of 23-10 as the first quarter 
ended.
In the second canto, Dembiski 
scored eight of the Titans 17 
points to give the visitors a half 
time lead of 40-23.
Sparked by Big Fred Paine, 
Westminsters second half defense 
worked to near perfection as they 
limited the Scots to only two field 
goals until the last four minutes 
of play when they picked up three 
more buckets against the Titan 
Reserves.
Intramural
Roundup
Basketball came in with a bang 
last week amidst a hail of baskets 
that makes it appear certain that 
there will be some exciting basket
ball played this season.
On Tuesday night the Hotshots 
led the way in getting the sea
son started by swamping the T.X. 
B team 57-27. The Hotshots had 
the game well in hand at half time 
with a 25-6 advantage and from 
there on in it was just a ques
tion of how much they would 
make.
D.U.s Win
In the other games played 
Tuesday night F.P.H.A. beat Emanon in a close contest 29-25; the 
S.A.E.s had no trouble taking 
over the Hot Rocks 47-19; and the 
D.U.s, led by Bill Koch, had 
enough to beat the Beta Sigs 30- 
19.
The Betas got off to a fast start 
in the National League Wednes
day night when they beat the Tau 
Delts with apparent ease 42-17. 
The Betas after a slow first 
quarter found the range and rack[Continued on page 8]
Luckey Breaks Pool Record 
As Tech Mermen Drop Two
Traveling to Cleveland over the last weekend, the Tech swim
ming team lost two meets, one to Case on Friday and the other to 
Oberlin on Saturday, the respective scores being 2257 and 3944. 
The Case meet was never in doubt, with the men from Cleveland 
taking firsts in the 300 yard medley relay, 220 yard freestyle, 100 yard 
freestyle, 50 yard dash, fancy diving, and 400 yard relay. Techs two 
lone firsts were garnered by the strong men of the squad, Spangler
in the 440 yard freestyle and , , _ .  .relay and Lee in the diving.
The weekend was not entirely
devoid of a victory, however. An
all star foursome of Schroeder,
Spangler, Zukaski, and Venger
whipped three conductors and a
porter on the train back in two
consecutive rubbers of bridge, no
holds barred.
The results:
1. 300 yd. medley won by Tech.
2. 220 yd. freestyle  1) Kinsey 
(O); 2) Spangler (T); 3) Burket (O).
3. 50 yd. freestyle  1) Hillery

3) Rasch (O).
8. 440 yd. freestyle  1) Hinrichs (O); 2) Spangler (T); 3) 
Burket (O).
9. 400 yd. relay won by Oberlin.
Luckey in the 200 yard breast 
stroke. A true thriller diller was 
the fight for second place in the 
440 yard freestyle. After lagging 
behind for most of the event, 
Pearlstein displayed a do-or-die 
effort and nosed out Cases Fuller 
by a hair and a half. The results:
1. 300 yd. medley relay won by 
Case.
2. 220 yd. free style1) Kountz 
(C); 2) Jones 3) Spangler (T).
3. 50 yd. dash  1) Sharer (C);
2) Kelly (C); 3) Venger (T).

(C).
5. 100 yd. free style  1) Roth 
(C); 2) Kuntz (C); 3) Penfield (T).
6. 150 yd. backstroke  1) Biggar (C); 2) Shorer (C); 3) 
Schroeder (T).
7. 200 yd. breaststroke  1) 
Luckey (T); 2) Ferguson (T);
3) Dunn (C).
8. 440 yd. freestyle1) Spangler 
(T); 2) Pearlstein (T); 3) Ful
ler (C).
9. 400 yd. relay won by Case. 
Oberlins victory over the Tar
tan squad was not quite so de
cisive as was Cases. The meet 
was tied at the outset of the last 
event, with Oberlin making it 
nine straight by means of a final 
victory in the 400 yd. relay. A 
constant ray of hope all season 
long, Dave Luckey again lived up 
to his advance press notices and 
broke the Oberlin pool record for 
the 200 yard breaststroke by 10 
(yes 10) seconds. He was follow
ed1 by Ferguspn, who broke the 
record by 3 seconds. Its amazing 
what a good nights sleep can do 
for some engineers. Other Tech 
firsts were Burke, Luckey, and 
Schroeder in the 300 yd. medley

An Open Letter To Dr. Doherty
It is doubtful that at some time or another you have not heard the 
complaints that have come about as a result of the sad state of inter
collegiate athletics as it presents itself at this school. The return of 
Carnegie Tech to intercollegiate wars was certainly a welcome sight 
at first. But the records that our teams have won for themselves 
in football and basketball have destroyed any enthusiasm or school 
spirit that might have shown itself. Ask the few faithful cheerleaders 
about the trend of school spirit. The first response was good, despite 
the fact that few of the cheers were known. As the football season 
wore on, the cheers grew smaller and smaller until they were non
existent. The very same thing has been true of the followers of basket
ball. *
We want to have something to cheer about. It is not the student 
bodys desire to sit night after night and see their teams go down.to 
defeat. Yet even the most rabid Tech fan goes to a game with a feel
ing of resignation: We are going to lose; but I hope the team puts 
up a good fight.
Our teams are beaten long before they take to the gridiron or to 
the hardwoods. They have been beaten by a set of circumstances, not 
by the opposition. And those circumstances are directly traceable to 
the schools policy regarding athletics. In this day of commercialized 
sports (and this is an admission of most schools engaged in inter
collegiate competition), we are one of the few simon-pures. No 
crass commercialism has entered the sports program at Tech. So we 
are losing games. We are the butts of many jokes, and we are on 
the butt end of the financial gains and prestige that might be realized 
if we had a winning team.
It is true that we, as so many schools of the country, cannot afford 
to provide financial lures for enough players to provide a winning 
football team of the 1938 variety. We cannot expect any man to give 
up the time that is necessary to get through this college and in ad
dition put himself through grueling hours of practice on the grid
iron. Admittedly, we are proud of the scholastic standing of the school, 
and we do not expect a lowering of requirements merely for the pur
pose of becoming national sports news. Yet there are some solutions 
that we shall attempt to offer for your consideration.
We cannot support a football team of Class A caliber. Let us con
sider that a foregone conclusion. But we can very easily concentrate 
on basketball. The problems that crop up in the recruiting and main
tenance of a football squad do not appear so great when they are 
reduced to the terms of a basketball squad. A football squad con
sists of from thirty to forty men. They must be fully equipped and 
fully trained. The equipment costs money and the training takes time. 
Some sort of financial bait would have to be offered if players of a 
high caliber are to be induced to play for Tech. That costs even more 
than the equipment. The four or five hours a day that a football team 
must practice cannot be spared. It is very difficult to keep up with 
the work required to maintain passing graces if much outside time 
is spent on other things. So we dont have the money or the time 
for a football team.
But a basketball team is different. The squad usually consists of 
from twelve to fifteen men. Their equipment is nil when compared 
with that which a football team requires. The chances of injuries and 
lost time are practically non-existent when compared with football. 
The amount of time that the squad would practice would not necessari
ly mean sacrificing school work. Two hours of practice a night should 
be sufficient during the regular season. And this practice takes place 
immediately following the school day and immediately preceding the 
evening meal. This is the dead portion of any students day.
All that would be necessary is the assurance that the right men 
were brought into the school to participate in the sport. To most po
tential college basketeers, very little inducement would be required 
to get them to come to Tech if they were assured proper recognition. 
It costs approximately $3,000 to bring an athlete into the school. At 
five men per year, this would mean $15,000. Certainly such an amount 
could be easily solicited from the alumni; and once the teams were 
established, the financial returns should help appreciably to defray 
any expenses that might be incurred.
These criticisms and suggestions have been offered in a different 
light than have previous outbursts in this column. We feel that the 
time for name calling is over. Lets get together and work this thing 
out.
' Respectfully yours,
Andy Cantini,
Penn State In 
Listless Win
State College, Pa., Feb. 12The 
Lions of Penn State College gave 
an exhibition of how not to be the 
perfect host last Wednesday night 
as they trounced the visiting Tech 
hoopsters by a very inhospitable 
53-32 score. Although the Tartans 
had been giving signs of a recov
ery in the last few weeks after a 
very inauspicious start, they 
lapsed back into the old form and 
the Nittany Lions had things 
pretty much their own way 
throughout.
Navy Helps Tech?
The game might have been even 
more onesided than it was had it 
not been for an announcement of 
West Virginias loss to Navy over 
the public address system just 
before the start of the contest. 
State is scheduled to play the 
Mountaineers in the very near 
future and after nearly beating 
them in the game at Morgantown, 
they had high hopes of being 
the first ones to mar the Hillbillys 
perfect record. With the announce
ment that the Middies had beaten 
them to it, the effect was very no
ticeable, and it seemed that they 
didnt have their heart in the task 
at hand.
Biery Leads Scoring
For the first five minutes it was 
a good ball game as the Lions 
played lackadaisical ball. But after 
that any resemblance to the game 
of basketball was strictly a fig
ment of the spectators imagina
tion. Notoriously hard to beat on 
their own floor, the Lions found 
no competition from the Tartans, 
anr proceeded to play quite as 
they pleased. Jack Beiry, ignoring 
the frigid blast outside the gym, 
set a torrid pace for the home 
team as he racked up 8 field goals 
and 5 fouls for 21 points, just 1 
point short of the individual 
scoring record for the State gym.
For Tech, little Leo Clougherty 
led the scorers with 7 points which 
was far below his usual total. Katsellas, also far from normal was 
next with 6, followed by Theodore 
with 5 and House with 4.

Am I going too fast? Before 
you have a chance to say uh, 
Dr. Epstein speeds along to the 
next point, a typical occurrence in 
the four sessions a week when 
he ascends from the depths of E. 
H. to teach advanced calculus.
Dr. Epstein is a member of the 
Coal Research labs in E. H. He 
received his M. S. in math from 
M. I. T. in 1938 and in 1941 re
ceived his Ph. D. from the Uni
versity of Illinois, where he 
taught for a short time. During 
the war, Dr. Epstein worked for 
the War Department and also for 
the Westinghouse Corporation.
One of his favorite subjects is 
economics although he also nib
bles at history and languages. 
Playing handball and pushing a 
piece of chalk with terrific speed 
cover his particular abilities in the 
sports world. As a result of the 
latter idiosyncrasy, his students 
took note of the need for a new, 
sturdier product and suggested 
the idea of a speed resisting chalk 
tr>  chalk manufacturer. At presthey are producing a water
'd chalk which will withstand 
is of 30 fps and rapid accel
erations of up to 20 gs. However, 
further improvements may be ne
cessary. Also on the way is an 
eraser, designed to jump all over
the blackboard so that it will 
erase material in the proper se
quence. (Further information will 
be supplied on request.)
Of course up till now Dr. Ep
stein has been taking it easy but 
as soon as he heard that the books 
had arrived, he smiled, rolled up 
his sleeves, and remarked Well, 
now we can get started. For next 
Monday read the first 200 pages 
and do a few thousand problems 
just to get the swing of things. 
Its easy. Youve covered the ma
terial already. You will find some 
very interesting problems in that 
group. (And he wasnt kidding.)
Then, picking up a sample of 
the new water cooled chalk, he 
remarked, Hmm, this chalk has 
some possibilities.

Questions and AnswersEditorial
[Continued from page 2]
House Mothers do not tell the 
girls when warnings are given, 
but just break the news to them 
when they have a Council offence. 
Some House Mothers go beyond 
the authority granted them by the 
Dormitory Council and award 
warnings for offences which are 
not so deemed by the Council.
In cases where girls will un
avoidably return late to the dor
mitory because of a late train, or 
because of a flat tire, if they 
telephone the House Mother im
mediately and tell them they ex
pect to be late, the customary 
penalties are not usually applied. 
However, very few girls are ac
quainted with this fact.
It seems to us that the school 
treats residents of girls dormi
tories as potential juvenile de
linquents, who will break forth 
into a life of sin if not Watched 
closely and punished severely for 
the slightest infraction of the 
rules. The attitude of a few of 
the House Mothers in particular 
seems to bear this out.
In conclusion, we would like to 
see the regulations liberalized to 
the point of treating the dormi
tory girls as young adults, and we 
would like the school to give to 
Dormitory Council the powers ac
tually assigned to it in its Consti
tution. R. C. E.
QIt is true that the bonds 
now being issued in payment of 
unused furlough time in the serv
ice can be applied toward pay
ments for National Service Life 
Insurance, and if so, how should 
I go about doing this?
AThe Veterans Administra
tion will accept terminal leave 
bonds at their present value, cred
iting the amount toward payment 
of premiums, conversion of poli
cies, or repayment of indebted
ness due on policies. It is rec
ommended that the veteran take 
his bonds to the nearest V. A. of
fice for instruction on the proced
ure to be followed.
QIs a veteran who has been 
granted compensation entitled to 
an increase in compensation if he 
suffers an increase in the severity 
of his disability?
AYes. The rate of increase in 
compensation depends upon the 
increase in disability.
QI served in the First World 
War and never bothered to take 
out Government Life Insurance. 
Can I still arrange to do so?
AYes, providing your period 
of service was between October 
6, 1917, and July 2, 1921, and your 
physical condition is approved by 
the V. A.
QWill it be possible for a 
widow of an ex-serviceman who 
has died since discharge, to col
lect terminal leave pay for un
used furlough time?
AWidows and dependents of 
veterans of World War II are 
eligible for payment if the vet
eran has died since discharge. 
There are special application 
forms for survivors of veterans. 
The instruction sheet available at 
your post office tell you how to 
apply.
QAre lenders required to get 
prior approval from the Veterans 
Administration before a guaran
teed loan can be made?
AIf the loan meets all the re
quirements of the act and reg
ulations, and is made by a super
vised lender, the guarantee is 
automatic and the answer is no. 
Other lenders must have prior 
approval.
QBefore the G. I. Bill was 
amended, I used up my whole 
guarantee of $2,000 to buy a farm. 
Now that the maximum guarantee 
has been increased to $4,000, 
would I be entitled to an addition
al $2,000 loan-guarantee if I wish 
to purchase more land?
AYes. If you used part or all 
of your loan guarantee before the 
Servicemens Readjustment Act 
(G. I. Bill) was amended last 
winter, the amount of loan-guar
antee credit used is deducted 
from the amount for which you 
are eligible under the amended 
bill, and the remainder is the 
amount of guaranteed credit 
which you may use in obtaining 
future loans.

Historical Sketch 
Of Washington
With the coming of February 
22 our thoughts once again turn 
to George Washington, first Presi
dent of the United States, a man 
among men. Although he was a 
physical giant of over six feet, 
he had a composed and dignified 
manner, and his majestic walk 
marked him as an aristocrat and a 
masterful man. Passion and pa
tience, nicely balanced, appeared 
in his regular placid features with 
his face muscles under perfect 
control. A resolutely closed mouth 
and a firm chin told of his per
fect moral and physical courage. 
The soundness of his judgment 
and the solidity of his informa
tion were notable qualities. He 
had little legal learning and was 
too shy and diffident for effec
tive speech. His eloquence, how
ever, was the eloquence of bat
tle. It had the note of challenge, 
and the gesture of chivalry when 
it threw down the gage of mortal 
combat, I will raise one thou
sand men, he said in 1775, at

my own expense and march my
self at their head for the relief of 
Boston. Believing in a course, he 
followed it, single-minded, just, 
firm and patient. No rash action 
or personal caprice were ever 
charged to him. He was able to 
bear great responsibility and cour
ageously to meet unpopularity and 
misrepresentation. There was no 
flaw in his devotion. Defeat is 
only a reason for exertion, he 
wrote, we shall do better next 
time.
Such was the spirit and devo
tion of the man who led us from 
the brink of defeat to the heights 
of freedom. Would that we could 
follow in his path of self-restraint 
and self-sacrifice so that when we 
pass on, it might be said of us, 
There goes a truly great man.

Miss De Maria reported that the 
first semester activity fees due 
Council had been deposited by 
the Institute.
Miss De Maria stated that since 
the Council was unable, because 
of unusual circumstances, to 
authorize payment of expenses 
incurred in the year 1945-46, 
such disbursements were made in 
the current year. She requested 
permission to keep the financial 
accounts for 1945-46 and 1946-47 
in one set of records and to post
pone closing the accounts for these 
two years until July, 1947. Per
mission was granted.
Old Business 
Miss Shack reported that ar
rangements for the dance on Feb
ruary 22 were progressing. Plans 
for decorating the hall, checking 
facilities and the provisions to be 
supplied to the Black Cat were 
discussed. Mr. Vranic was ap
pointed to plan a decorating 
scheme for the hall.
Mr. Bogovich moved that Mr. 
Martello and Mr. Miller be ap
pointed co-chairmen of the En
gineers Banquet. These persons 
will choose their assistants and 
aids for the banquet.
New Business
On behalf of Miss Ashcraft, 
Miss Zellner asked that permis
sion be granted to buy a bulletin 
board for the posting of assign
ments and information pertinent 
in the PLAID, and wire baskets 
for the PLAID office. Mr. Mihe
lich moved that Miss Ashcraft 
be given permission to purchase
these items, seconded by Mr. 
Martello, and approved by the 
Council.
Mr. Mihelich read a letter writ
ten by Miss Zellner on behalf 
of the Womens Evening Student 
Organization applying for recog
nition and permission to operate 
on the campus for the purpose of 
eventually forming a womens 
sorority with the usual functions 
thereto. Mr. Martello moved this 
petition be approved, seconded 
by Mr. Bogovich and approved by 
the Council.
On behalf of Miss Ashcraft, 
Miss Zellner spoke to the Coun
cil regarding Miss Ashcrafts hope 
that the PLAID dinner, which 
was sponsored by Council last 
year for the PLAID staff, be es
tablished as a precedent for a 
similar annual affair. Favorable 
comment was given by the Coun
cil, but since there is no need for 
an immediate decision, it was 
agreed to discuss this matter at a 
future date when a larger number 
of Council members are present.

ed up 36 points in the last three
quarters.
Delts, Kilroy Fall
In the two tough games of the 
evening the Kappa Sigs beat the 
Delts when they broke a fourth 
quarter tie of 19-19 to move on 
and win 29-19, while the Phi 
Kaps outlasted Kilroy to win 33- 
31. Kilroy, with a two point lead 
at the end of the third quarter, 
was unable to make more than 
four points in the final quarter 
while the Delts really couldnt 
find the range as they failed to 
make a point in the same period. 
T.X. Wins
Over in the Federal League the 
Betas B team came from behind 
to beat the PiKAs 21-19. At the 
same time the T.X. A team got 
started on its way to the league 
crown by beating the Kappa Sigs 
B team 57-7.
Citcom showed itself to be the 
only other team in the Federal 
League when it took over the 
Dorm Combine 42-20. In the re
maining game the A.T.O.s squeez
ed out a tight one from the Grec
ian Tide 29-27.
Bowlins
The two-way tie that has lasted 
for the past month remained un
broken in the Spare League as the 
Betas and Tau Delts both lost one 
game last Saturday.
The Tau Delts managed to win 
two games out of three from the 
Delts in a match in which all 
games were decided by 40 pins 
or less. At the same time the Betas 
were able to win two games from 
the S.A.E.s after losing the first 
by 56 pins. If the Betas can get 
past Kilroy this Saturday the Tau 
Delt-Beta match which is sched
uled at the end of the season 
should prove a fitting climax. 
T.N.T. Upset
The Dorm Combine pulled the 
upset of the week when it beat 
 T. two games out of three to 
e into a second place tie with 
C.E. This leaves T.N.T. on 
with a one game lead. The 
next meeting of the Strike League
