Campus Observes 
Religious Week
Th campus observance of Re
ligious Discussion Week was in
augurated by an assembly last 
Tuesday in the Fine Arts theater 
and highlighted by a dinner the 
same evening in the Union spon
sored by the YMCA and CWCA. 
Guest speaker at both affairs was 
Dr. John F. Thomas, of Princeton 
University, who spoke on the 
weeks theme What Place Has 
Religion in Higher Education. Dr. 
Thomas advocated that every col
lege and university place several 
courses in religion on their cur
ricula.
Contributing to the success of 
the wek were the numerous discussion-meetings held by many 
campus organizations. These 
meetings, held in the Union, fra
ternity houses, and the dorms, 
were conducted by prominent re
ligious leaders from the Pittsburgh 
district.
A student committee, under 
the faculty sponsorship of Deans 
Warden and Yon, Mr. Rollin V. 
Davis and Professor Dennison, did 
an excellent job of planning and 
organizing the program for the 
week. Merle Wolff, Alpha Phi 
Omega, headed the committee 
comprised of the following repre
sentative group: Dorothy Stewart 
from Teknon; Lillian Simpson, 
Pan Hellenic; Peggy Gautsch, 
Lutheran Student Association; 
Jane Grim, Newman Club; Milton 
Hobbs, Scobell Hall; Andrew F. 
Nutter, Techvets and Student 
Council; Clara Herron, Tartan; 
Mary Lou Lerch, Womens Dorm 
Council; Charlotte Young, CWCA; 
and Robert Straka, Newman Club.
Du Pont Awards 
74 Fellowships
The Du Pont Company an
nounced on February 25th that it 
will award more than twice as 
many university fellowships this 
year as in 1945. Seventy-four 
awards will go to 45 universities 
as contrasted with 35 fellowships 
to 24 institutions last year. Since 
the chemical industry in which Du 
Pont is a leader is facing a major 
shortage of chemists, physicists, 
and engineers with advanced 
training, the corporation is offer
ing generous aid to qualified men 
and women. Those who are in
terested in advanced training will 
be selected by the universities in
volved. The pre-war post-doc
toral program has also been re
vived. Furthermore, no restric
tions on future employment is 
placed on the recipient when the 
fellowship expires.
Each post-graduate fellowship 
offers $1200 for a single person or 
$1800 for a married person, to
gether with an award of $1000 to 
the university. In the case of a 
post-doctoral fellowship, the 
awards increase to $2000 and $1500 
respectively. The colleges share 
is intended to finance tuition and 
fees with the remainder going to 
the department in question for 
whatever purposes it sees fit.
Awards were made to Carnegie 
Tech in the departments of chem
ical engineering and physics. Other 
major schools received them in 
such classifications as mechanical 
engineering and chemistry. Many 
promising young scientists and en
gineers should be able to carry on 
their researches for the benefit of 
all because of *v generous 
grants. ^
Under the leadership of Danny 
Franks, Carnegie dramatic pro
ducer and photographer, a large 
group of interested students have 
begun rebuilding the Scotch and 
Soda organization of pre-war 
years. It should be explained to 
all new Tech students that 
Scotch and Soda is to Carnegie 
Tech what The Mask and Wig 
show is to the University of Pitts
burgh, and what The Hasty Pud
ding production is to Harvard 
men.
This year the committee is 
planning a musical reviewthe 
best entertainers on campus will 
star in a fast moving review with 
lots of audience appeal. It will 
be a part of the Spring Carnival. 
Behind the scenes and on the pro
duction line are the necessary cos
tume, business, production, and 
publicity committees. Original 
songs, dances, and jokes will be 
highlighted. All of this effort 
promises to start Tech off toward 
bigger and better Scotch and Soda 
shows in the coming years. Be
cause so many students have good 
ideas for such shows, a prize will 
be given next fall for the best 
musical score and book. Dramats, 
Maggie Murphs, and engineers 
alike have the summer months to 
work on their ideas. Think it 
over. What an opportunity for 
competition with Oscar Hammer - 
stein or Billy Rose.
All departments are represent
ed on this spring effort. Chair
men of these committees include: 
Production, Julianne Stausbury 
and George Stupakis; Business, 
Merle Wolff and Jean Price; Sec
retarial, Mary Jane Horridge; Or
chestra and Music, Jay Maratta 
and Kick Hoch; Dances, Jane 
Culp and Tom OMalley; Cos
tume, June Shannon and A1 Leh
man; Skit, A1 Checco and Ernie 
Motyl; Publicity, Les Engle and 
Burt Quint. If superb talent, lots 
of work, and high hopes insure a 
successful show, Tech once more 
will have another of its unbeata
ble combinations back on campus 
Scotch and Soda.
Cwens and Scimatars 
Plan Sophomore Hop
The Cwens and the Scimitars, 
the mens and womens sophomore 
honoraries, are collaborating to 
sponsor an informal dance to be 
held in the mens gym on Satur
day, March 16. Music will be 
provided by the well-known 
orchestra of Billy Leroy. In keep
ing with the date, the theme of the 
Shamrock Sham will be that of 
St. Patricks Day, (for those of you 
who are not sons of Eire, sham 
means a dance, and St. Patricks 
Day is March 17).
In order that Carnegie mar
ried veterans and their wives 
may become better acquainted 
with others in their gToup, 
and that we may have the 
privilege of meeting those 
whom we do not already 
know, we cordially invite 
them to the Carnegie Union 
on Sunday afternoon, March 
10, from three to six oclock. 
Individual invitations will not 
be sent.

Westinghouse Will 
Award Fellowships
The Westinghouse Electric Cor
poration has announced the re
establishment of post-doctorate 
fellowships for research in physics, 
including physical chemistry, phy
sical metallurgy and applied me
chanics. The applications for these 
awards, which will be announced 
in May, must be in by the 15th of 
April. Their purpose is to stimu
late pure scientific research as 
well as to solve problems which 
are confronting the electrical in
dustry in these fields.
The fellows will devote their full 
time to this work, which must be 
begun before October 1st. The 
usual two- weeks vacation will be 
granted as well as leave to visit 
conferences of pertinent interest. 
The people taking part are ex
pected to participate in the gen
eral program of the Westinghouse 
Research Laboratories, and will 
render periodic reports and a 
final summation of their work, 
suitable for publication, at the'end 
of the year. The salary is $3300 a 
year and all personnel are eligible 
for one additional reappointment. 
The applicants should fill out 
forms available in the Office of the 
Dean or the department head, and 
should then submit a detailed out
line of their proposed research, in
cluding a statement of the im
portance of the problem, the pro
posed mode of attack, and a brief 
account of special facilities need
ed. An alternative problem may 
be submitted.
The Westinghouse Research 
Laboratories were first organized 
as a coherent whole in 1916. Size 
was more than doubled in 1930 
and subsequent additions have en
larged their facilities and scope 
still further. A ceramics labor
atory and a nuclear physics labor
atory equipped with a large belttype electro-static generator are 
items in the new equipment. Also, 
labs are set up for research in 
many branches of physics, such as 
electronics, magnetics, and dielec
trics, as well as in chemical and 
metallurgical fields. Excellent 
service facilities are available 
In conformity with Company 
regulations, the fellows must sign 
the usual Patent Agreement relat
ing to the assignment of all in
ventions made.
Opens With Assembly
Three Stray Cheer Leaders 
Conduct Pep Rally in Skiho
To encourage Tech students in 
their fight to get a. case against 
Case last Saturday night, the cheer 
leaders held a miniature pep rally 
in the Beanery at the lunch hour 
on Friday. The cheer leaders were 
in wonderful voice.. They filled 
Skibo with loud and raucous calls 
which soared to the very rafters of 
that venerable building. To at
tract the attention of the diners 
they rang a large and insistent 
cow bell. The students, distracted 
from filling their mouths with 
tasty morsels (in Skibo?), re
sponded in a half-hearted air w, 
their victuals til the atmospl 
in the Beanery was very rich 
deed.
The most popular cheer was the
Engineers Cheer. Augie Binder 
and Doug Wilde performed Fight 
Team Fight using a table for a 
stage. This discomfited a young 
man sitting at the table no end, 
and he was forced to take notice of 
the cheering when his sandwich 
got kicked into his teeth.
After leading the cheers, the 
cheerleaders led Techs three songs 
and the students joined inthey 
really did this time. After giving 
a few more exhortations to the 
students to support the Carnegie 
Tech-Case game, the cheerleaders 
left the floor to the Dramats who 
continued the singing at a table in 
front of the sandwich counter with 
a few up-to-date selections like 
Shine On Harvest Moon.
Faculty Honor 
Dr, Ernst Beryl
Contributions have been made to 
the Faculty Memorial Scholarship 
Fund by the Faculty and by sev
eral friends in memory of Dr. 
Ernst Berl, former Professor of 
Chemical Engineering, and re
search professor from 1933 to 1945. 
This fund which has been estab
lished to perpetuate the memory 
of deceased faculty members is 
maintained by contributions from 
the Faculty and from former stu
dents and friends of members 
whose spirit may live on and 
whose service may continue in 
death, as in life.
Contributions to this fund are 
not limited to the Faculty; any
one wishing to do something in 
memory of a teacher who meant 
much to him during his college 
years may join the Faculty in 
helping to create a worthy memo
rial to men and women who gave 
years of devoted service to Car
negie Institute of Technology.
Cards on which the name of the 
donor is entered have been pro
vided and will be sent to the fam
ily of the deceased whenever a 
contribution is made.
Student Council 
Plans Stag Dance
On Saturday. March 9, after the 
basketball game with West Vir
ginia, there will be another stag 
dance, sponsored by Student 
Council. Refreshments will be 
served downstairs in the Black 
Cat by APO. This is the last bas
ketball game of the season; there 
probably will be a good turn-out 
at the game and consequently the 
dance should be comparatively 
well attended.
The basketball dances have 
proved quite popular. At the last 
one, an added attraction was the 
appearance of the Case players. 
The atmosphere of Thistle Hall 
has certainly been improved by 
its new coat of paint, and the 
lovely pastel colors are a great 
aid to relaxation. You can de
pend on the very best in the line 
of music, for the recordings of 
all the big name bands are used. 
Everyone should make an effort 
to be present at the last of this 
series of dances.
CWCA Plans Dance 
For Student Charity
Carnegie Womens Christian As
sociation is planning a Tea Dance 
for March 13th. Plans thus far, 
made by the members of CWCA, 
are to charge twenty-five cents ad
mission at the entrance to Thistle 
Hall. The dance will be on the 
same order as the previous dance 
sponsored by Student Council. An 
enjoyable afternoon from four to 
six oclock is promised by CWCA.
This dance will provide funas 
for the World Student Service 
Fund. This is an organization 
wherely students in the United 
States and Great Britain raise 
money to lend a helping hand to 
students in war-ravaged countries.
Notice
Anyone interested in camp 
counseling: jobs for the sum
mer should file their applica
tion with Mrs. Kreigline, Ind. 
155-A, as soon as possible. 
There are openings in all 
fields, for both men and wom
en counselors.
Mortar Board, Senior Womens 
Honorary, presented an assembly 
program today to usher in the Red 
Cross Drive on the Tech campus. 
This vital drive, which began on 
March 5 and extends to March 11, 
was keynoted by Miss Jane Ellen 
Ball, a veteran of three and onehalf years service in the European 
Theater. She spoke about her ex
periences there, where she had 
risen to command of the Red Cross 
cinemobile and other recreation 
facilities for American troops in 
occupied Germany. This talk 
brought back many memories to 
ex-servicemen, whose service both 
in the United States and abroad 
was made easier by the sudden 
and unexpected appearance of a 
smiling Red Cross girl serving ice 
cream ' or coffee, or the efficient 
lady who magically arranged a 
furlough when there was serious 
illness in the family and normal 
Army channels proved unrespon
sive.
Now, in times of peace, the Red 
Cross is still hard at work, helping 
the returning veteran and alleviat
ing the miseries of calamity and 
disaster all over the country. In 
order to continue this work on the 
gigantic scale necessary to the 
completion of a good job, the Red 
Cross needs support.
Girls with collection boxes will 
be stationed all over the Tech 
campus during the coming week, 
asking for your contributions. It 
is hoped that students will remem
ber what that sign of the Red 
Cross has meant to Them in the 
past, think of what it must do in 
the future, and give welL

WHERE WILL YOU HIDE
Well, drag out your gas masks, kiddies, and dig yourselves 
a couple of impervium-lined atom-bomb shelters cause were 
off to the wars again, or will be in the near future. It seems 
that while weve all been patting ourselves on the back for 
the beautiful (?) reconversion job we are doing here at 
Carnegie and having a gay young time generally, the world 
has been getting itself in terrible shape again. Things are in 
sad shape in India, in Indonesia, in China and in America, but 
in Germany theyre simply out of this world.
Do you remember all that big talk we heard for years 
about the wonderful job of reeducating and rehabilitating 
Germany we were going to do as soon as the fighting in Europe 
was over? Do you remember all the big words that were 
spoken at the Potsdam Conference last summer about de
mocratization and about de-industrialization? Do you remem
ber how sure we once were that after this war we would 
make a peace that would put an end to quarreling in Europe? 
They were beautiful words and they made it possible for us 
a final end to the fighting. But apparently they 
ords. You and I have taken it for granted that 
/as being done to carry them into effect, but 
nothing has been done in the American zone of German occu
pation at least.
At the Potsdam conference, the Big Three decided to 
remove from Germany the heavy industry which has twice 
enabled her to wage a great war. They also decided that all 
Nazis, on whose shoulders the responsibility for the war rests, 
should be removed from offices of power and authority. 
Neither of these objectives have so far been carried out in a 
satisfactory manner in the zone of American occupation. 
American Army officers who were business men before the 
war are hesitating to destroy their foreign investments by 
liquidating German war plants. They find the Hitler-trained 
Nazis far more efficient than the more liberal elements in 
the occupied territory. They are also afraid that anti-Nazi 
liberal elements in the country may introduce socialism into 
the capitalistic German buffer state which they consider their 
last bulwark against world communism. Consequently, they 
have not destroyed German industry, they have left the Nazis 
in power, and they have discouraged and often openlyopposed 
the development of democratic groups in the conquered 
country. They have totally failed to follow the Potsdam plan.
The world expected the Americans to set an example for 
efficiency and for democratic fairness in their area of occupa
tion. So far we have demonstrated only inefficiency and stu
pidly undemocratic bungling. The education of the occupation 
troops about which we have heard so much now appears to be 
totally lacking. The Americans know how to build bridges, 
install manitary water systems, and get power plants running, 
but they have not been taught to lead a disrupted society back 
to political, economic and social rationality. They know noth
ing about Germanys history, and they know less of what 
their part should be in molding her future. The few men who 
have been trained in German political science have already 
been furloughed home or discharged under the point system, 
and no effort has been made to replace them with trained men. 
There are no men available to teach the Germans democratic 
ways of thinking and living, so former Nazis are naively 
given the jobs. The Germans justifiably think that we and our 
democratic system are totally inefficient and useless. In short 
we have done more than our share as a nation to make the 
peace a world wide fiasco.
So what? What can we as students do about it? We can 
at least write to our congressmen, express our disgust and 
demand a civilian education program and a change in military 
policy, and hope to heaven that the leaders of today make it 
unnecessary that we fight tomorrow. C. H.

One Burp to the Breeze 
Department:
The one and only Burp this 
week will have to go to Dormitory 
Council for allowing the ridiculous 
penalties to be placed on the heads 
of three Carnegie girls, namely 
Joan Bower, Nancy Beemer, and 
Jane Ramsey. This column is be
ing written without their knowl
edge or permission, because after 
investigating the factsthe End 
Man feels that not only should 
Dormitory Council rescind their 
penalties but Dormitory Council 
and the School should apologize to 
those girls for imposing ridiculous 
and cruel punishments. The End
I.R.C. Will Discuss 
The Loan to Britain
Effective this week, the Inter
national Relations Club will meet 
on Tuesday at 4:30 in room 102, 
Margaret Morrison, instead of on 
Wednesdays. The topic for dis
cussion this week will be The 
Loan To Britain. This subject has 
occupied the minds of the Ameri
can people and Congress for the 
past few months. The proposed 
$3,750,000,000 loan has also stir
red a considerable amount of un
favorable comment in dollar-hun
gry Britain because of the 2% 
interest rate asked. The British 
feel that they deserve the loan 
free because of their heroic sac
rifices during the war. American 
opinion is divided into two groups, 
those who frankly wouldnt give 
Britain the time of day, and those 
who believe that it is essential 
that we restore our wartime ally 
to her economic and political feet 
with this life-giving injection.
The members of the I. R. C. will 
thrush out these opposing view
points in their coming meeting. 
All students are invited to attend 
and participate in the usual en
thusiastic discussions which these 
topics cause in such internation
ally-minded circles.
Man knows a number of the girls 
on Dormitory Council and is aware 
of the fact that they are of the 
highest calibre. That is why he 
cannot understand why they let 
such stupid penalties be passed. 
The End Man has always been in 
favor of student government and 
student representation, but he 
feels that Dormitory Council has 
more power than should be given 
to any body of students. Dormi
tory Council has it within their 
power to ruin a girls stay at col
lege and that is something that 
should not be allowed. The End 
Man is not questioning the ability 
of all of the house presidents that 
make up Dormitory Council. 
Now, lets be sensible about the 
whole thing. There have to be 
restrictions, thats true, but in 
placing these restrictions sorority 
affiliation, personal opinion, and 
inter-college feuds SHOULD def
initely NOT influence any of 
Dormitory Councils members. 
They wield more power than any 
other group on campus and should 
be very careful in passing judg
ment. The End Man is not going 
to go into the cases of Joan Bow
er, Nancy Beamer, and Jane Ram
sey; most everyone on campus 
knows them and likes them. All 
three of them got absolutely rot
ten deals and the End Man was 
certainly glad to see that a large 
number of people on campus have 
been talking about it and feel very 
sorry about the whole thing. In 
one of the girls cases, a petition 
was going to be passed around by
her friends and by people th 
have known her perhaps a littl< 
bit longer than the people wh< 
passed judgment on her from the 
Council. A petition IS STILL go 
ing to be passed around if som 
action isnt taken AND soon. An
drew Carnegie said My Heart iin the Work, but the End Mar 
feels that the motto of Camegi 
Tech 1946 should be Remove 
Pettiness.
Closing Up Shop Department:
^ After throwing that little bomb 
shell, I suppose the End Man 
should hide for awhile. Hes jus 
happy that he doesnt live in a 
dorm and that ithere isnt any sorl 
of Dormitory Council that coulc 
bestow penalties on him. Ye Gods 
hed be expelled, campused, garroted, hung, electrocuted, shackled 
stoned and forced to learn the 
words to the Alma Mater.
Commuters Hold 
Big Clan Meeting
Citcom Clan, Techs commuter 
organization, will hold a clen 
meeting on Wednesday, Marcii 6! 
in Room 14 M.M.C.C. 4 
This meeting was re-schedutea 
from last Wednesday to prevent a 
conflict with the Student Council 
Tea Dance.
Plans will be made for a barn 
dance to be held March 15th in 
Thistle Hall, and a complete social 
program for the semester will be 
discussed.
All commuters on the campus 
are urged to attend this meeting 
whether or not they are yet mem
bers of the clan.
C1T Veterans Take Action
In the future, the Tecvets will 
meet at 4:30 P. M. on the first Fri
day of each month. The change 
from the old meeting time of 6:30 
P. M. has been made for the ben
efit of the Tech commuters who 
wish to attend.
Joe Nutter has been authorized 
by vote of the Tecvets to repre
sent them in contacting the ad
ministration to see what can be 
done on improving the food situa
tion at Skibo. Many veterans have 
expressed the opinion that the 
price of a meal is a little high, 
perhaps due to the a la carte 
system.
A box is to be located at some 
central position to receive mem
bership applications to Tecvets. 
Information will be available there 
on the nature and purpose of the 
organization. It is felt that the 
veterans on the campus could 
benefit more from the activities of 
this service organization if better 
informed about it.
JletteA ta CrdtUosi
AND STILL MORE
Id like to echo the sentiments 
of one of the boys in this weeks 
Tartan. I find that I am in com
plete accord with the author in re
gard to sloppy co-ed attire. I am 
not one of your war heroesthe 
nearest I came to becoming a cas
ualty was the time I walked by a 
dart board in a London pub dur
ing a match gameBut I too have 
had my fill of shoddy females.
The English girls, however, were 
doing their best, but the rationing 
system, rather the absolute lack of 
clothing and cosmetics, made their 
best efforts a farce. It was actu
ally pathetic the effects they ob
tained. The English girl, in gen
eral, doesnt even have as much 
to start with as the American girl 
has.
So let me make this plea to the 
girls on the Carnegie Tech cam
pus, Please look as well groomed 
as possible, not merely because 
of the possibility of getting more 
dates (not having a date with me 
certainly couldnt be construed as 
a loss,) not because I or any other 
ex-G.I. dont like blue jeans, but 
because self respect alone demands 
that you look your very best at all
timesand if you dont have selfrespectwellyou just dont have 
anything.
Sincerely,
Another one of the boys.
WHAT ABOUT IT, TARTAN?
What has happened to the Tar
tan? Last semester the paper 
came out on Tuesday, and there 
was a pile in front of the regis
trars office. Sure, there are more 
students this semester, but are all 
the papers picked up in just a few 
minutes? In short, where does 
one find a copy and what day?
Also, how about some advance 
publicity for the plays given at the 
Little Theater of Fine Arts. If 
there are too few tickets for the 
whole student body, is that justi
fication for not giving everyone a 
fair chance to get them?

WITCHES HANGED IN SALEM
Dear Editor:
It was quite a compliment to

Housing Group Meets
Wednesday evening, February
27, the Veterans Housing Group 
held a meeting. According to Joe 
Nutter, chairman of the group, a 
point system was set up to deter
mine which veterans will have the 
preference of the available homes. 
The group plans to advertise for 
vacancies in the local newspaper.
The items considered in assign
ing priorities were: number of
children, present housing condi
tions, distance from school and the 
percent of income now being paid 
for rent.
Another meeting was held yes

under this new system.
ed in Salem; they were hanged. If 
you will look up your history, you 
will find that the town fathers 
of Salem never thought of burn
ing because it was so unsanitary. 
Hanging is much cleaner and the 
job can be done with so much 
less trouble.
We in Salem still perpetuate 
the memory of Gallows Hill as a 
constant reminder of the histor
ical value of Salem. As for 
my surviving the burning, there
fore, you can see that you were 
absolutely wrong. I was very for
tunate in having a strong neck 
and carrying a lot of influence; I 
was able, therefore, to overcome 
the obstacle of being hanged.
Considering all the previous 
statements, I hereby make the 
following resolution: From.; this 
day forth, the twenty-third of 
February, in the year of our Lord, 
nineteen hundred and forty-six, I 
hereby resolve that the witches 
in Salem were hanged and not 
burned at the stake and let no 
man put asunder.

MM Science Club 
Plans Activities
The Science Club, which con
sists of about thirty science and 
nursing students from Margaret 
Morrison, is striving for' a. more 
active membership this semester. 
At the last meeting many inter
esting projects were planned; a 
trip to Heinzs, another to Mellon 
Institute, and possibly one to a 
steel mill. Arrangements were 
made for a theater party on March 
13th. The members of the club 
will have dinner in the small din
ing room of Skibo and then go to 
see The Merchant of Yonkers in 
the Little Theater.
The officers of the club, Ruth 
Flanagan, President; Catherine 
Brosky, Vice-President; Stephanie 
Kwolek, Secretary-Treasurer; and 
Mary Elizabeth Rapach, Social 
Chairman, hope that this semester 
will prove as active as many in the 
past when the girls undertook 
such projects as making cosmetics, 
serving lab dinner in watch glasses 
and beakers, and having picnics 
with the Chemistry Club.
Club members can be identified 
by the silver and black enamel 
club pin which shows a benzene 
ring representing chemistry and 
a squid representing biology. The 
two branches of science are also 
represented by the club sponsers, 
Dr. Miller of the chemistry depart
ment and Miss Tuttle of the biol
ogy department.

Real hot music or the popular 
classics (such as Gershwin) are 
Julies meat; she claims die 
doesnt understand the symphon
ies. She loves drama howeverboth reading and going to plays.
Then we come to Julies fav
orite pastime: she loves going to 
baseball games and is an avid 
Pirate fan. Or at least that is one 
of Julies favorite pastimes; going 
out on dates is the other. Julie 
likes movies, British ones in par
ticular, but her spare time is often 
spent reading books, (text of 
course).
Julie possesses a jovial person
ality, and she is always bubbling 
over with something. A while 
ago, for instance, after spending 
two hours reading very technical 
copy for the Technical which in
cluded an article on the Several 
Principles of Mechanics Julie 
left the Union and decided that 
since the snow had melted she 
would remove the chains from her 
car. In that relatively simple job, 
really easy compared to some of 
the papers she had just read and 
understood, she made a slight 
mistake. It took her an hour and 
a half to get the chains un
tangled from the axles.
Last Sunday night the Carnegie 
Tech Mens Glee Club put on a 
show which would make even 
Fred Waring sit up and take 
notice. With some thirty-five of 
its members participating, this 
vocal group sang coast-to-coast 
over the Associated Broadcasting 
Company network. The program, 
which was broadcast from 9:30 to 
9:45 p. m., originated from the 
Exhibition Room in Fine Arts.
Beginning with an excellent ararrangement of Dear Old Tech, 
the Glee Club then sang The 
Sleigh, Drunken Sailor, Stout
hearted Men, Hark, the Vesper 
Hymn, and The Jolly Roger. For 
their final selection, the vocal 
group presented The Alma Mater 
as it really should be sung and 
thus rounded out fifteen minutes 
of enjoyable entertainment.
Directed by Paul Brautigam, 
vocal director, the Mens Glee 
Club will participate in several 
other events during the year in
cluding a combined sing with the 
Tech Womens Glee Club.

course.
Julie, when we get down to a 
description of her, is five feet five 
inches tall and has green eyes 
(no she isnt jealous, they have 
just always been green and she 
has never bothered changing 
them). When we asked her for a 
description of her ideal man she 
said that he must be intelligent, 
reasonably ambitious, and have a 
sense of humor. When we man
aged to pin her down to the con
troversial question of Skibo or 
Skeebo, she prefers Skibo. Her 
reason is simple: it sounds better.
Julie, who has been a resident 
of our fair city since she was six, 
has always wanted to come to the 
Tech School of Engineering. 
When she was in eleventh grade 
in high school she decided she 
wanted to be a physicist. Julie has 
what she wanted, because she is 
now a senior majoring in physics 
at Tech.
In addition to the Technical and

of Sigma Kappa sorority and a

Engineering Honorary 
Organizes Activities
Thursday, February 21, Pi Tau 
Sigma, national mechanical engi

organization meeting since the in
itiation of the new members and 
the election of new officers. The 
plans for activities for the coming 
year were discussed. The most 
important topic under discussion 
was the qualifications of prospec
tive members. Interviews for 
those particular men who are eli
gible will be held in the middle 
of March. Earl Obringer is chair
man of the committee in charge 
of membership. The initiates will 
be tapped on Call Day, \vhich will 
be held during Spring Carnival.

be held on Friday, March 15, from
9 to 12 oclock in Thistle Hall. The 
dance will be stag, and the price 
will be 25c including refreshments.
The purpose of the dance is to

Aout 7,000 miles of coaxial cable will be added to 
l our plant during the next few years. Inside each 
cable are six or eight copper tubes  each pair a broad 
communications highway over which two television 
programs or nearly 500 long distance telephone calls 
can travel. Giant plow-trains will w plant mueh of this 
cable deep in the groundsafe from storm and fire.
This construction is but a part of our activity in the 
television field. Now in an advanced experimental stage 
are plans to link coaxial cables and high frequency 
radio relay systems to provide a nationwide television 
network.
Our part in television is the transmission of pro
grams from one station to another. As this new industry 
develops, the Bell System will be prepared to provide 
whatever network facilities are needed.

 TECH SPORTS 
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman 
The Yogi Predicts!
When you pick up a Pittsburgh paper these days and look at the 
sports section, theres always just two things to look atthe doings 
of the Hornets and the practices of the Pirates. For the Hornets I
have hopes, but the Pirates? All the big talk around the Pirate camp
seems to have to do with one-------------------------------------------------------
Ralph Kiner. Well, Ralph used 
to play with Albany in the East
ern League and Ive seen him in 
action many times, and all Ive 
got to say is that if the Bucs 
cant fijnd anyone better than 
that to cheer about, theyd better 
resign themselves to fighting it 
out with the Cincinnati Reds for 
the cellar position in the Nation
al League. Kiner hits a long ball, 
alright, but you never saw a guy 
knock so many hard ground balls 
to the short stop, when he had 
men on. He looks tremendous in 
the Pirate camp ... so, who has 
Pittsburgh got who can pitch?
Dahlgren is battering the boards, 
too, sooo? I dont want to pan 
Kiner, he may have come a long 
way, but still I think the sports 
pages make things look a little 
bit rosy for the Pirates. I dont 
see how they can do better than 
sixth place.
That basketball game with Case 
the other night sure was a drowsy 
affair and the refs didnt help the 
situation any. They looked like 
they were thoroughly bored with 
the whole affair. But then, may
be they were. Tech was awfully 
lucky it had Marty Chetlin on 
the floor. The wee one played a 
great ball game and seemed to be 
the only one on the court who 
was awake half the time.
And then there was Mike 
Evans, who thought hed sit on 
the other side of the bleachers 
so he could look at the women 
without twisting his neck.
W. Va. Here Sat.!
Hear Ye, Hear Ye! Want to see 
one of the nations top basketball 
teams in action? Then drap your 
carcass over to the Tech gym this 
coming Saturday. The West Vir
ginia Mountaineers will provide 
the opposition for the Skibos.

Natators Drop 
Final To Case
The Carnegie Natators ran into 
a rather stiff snag on Saturday 
afternoon when they met a team 
which was supposedly weakened 
by the lose of its best swimmers 
due to the moving out of the Navy 
men located there. Early on this 
fateful day a large number of 
boys in sailor suits were noticed 
coming around the campus asking 
directions to the Tech Pool. Then 
the fact leaked out. Thirty of the 
old members of the V-12 program 
had been ordered to stay at Case. 
Some of these boys happened to be 
on the swimming team. That was 
only the beginning.
Macyauskas was really the fair 
haired boy for Tech again in this 
meet as he garnered two firsts and 
one second to amass a total of 13 
points out of Techs total of 27.
This meet was the closeout for 
the tankers this year so it doesnt 
do much good to gripe about the 
interest shown in this sport now. 
However, one point should be 
noted, and that is that all sports 
are for the interest of the stu
dents. Only by supporting them 
and by becoming interested in 
them can they be expected to ex
ist. With this thought in mind for 
next year, we take leave.

Intramural
Roundup
Basketball and bowling came 
into their own as the second week 
of Intramural play featured sev
eral fast and furious contests on 
the gym floor and a couple of 
real upsets down the maple lanes.
The PiKAs fast-breaking quin
tet started the week off right when 
they pulled ahead on Dick DiPrimas field goal to stop the tor
rid TNTs in the closing seconds 
of a tight 26-25 ball game. Else
where in League I the DUs 
coasted to a 31-12 victory over the 
PBAs as George Marshall did the 
scoring honors with half the DU 
points.
Twice-beaten S c o b e 11 Hall 
chalked up one marker in the win 
column by upsetting League-lead
ing Phi Kappa 33-30. But the Phi 
Kaps made up for their loss by 
knocking off the high-riding 
PiKAs 22-19. In the final game 
of the week TX dropped an under
manned DU squad 24-12.
SAE was the big name in 
League II with victor- es three and 
four credited to their account at 
the expense of the Tau Delts and 
the Dorm Combine. Cartenson 
paced the SAEs to their 38-26 win 
over the Tau Delts by racking-up 
an impressive total of 21 points. 
After trailing for three quarters 
SAE showed it had plenty of fight 
as the combine went down to de
feat 34-30.
Meanwhile the Betas stayed in 
reaching distance by winning their 
third against no defeats. The vic
tim was Delta Tau Delta by a 32- 
23 count. Other games saw the 
class section 7-B lose one to the 
Combine 31-21 and another to 
the Delts 37-22.
Things were tough for the DU 
bowling squad last week. First an 
Intramural Board ruling took 
away for them a game which 
they had won by almost a hun
dred and fifty pins, and then the 
loss of three of the teams stars 
made them easy prey for the 
SAEs who toppled them from 
the top of the league by making 
a clean sweep of Saturdays ser
ies.
The Beta Sigs were way out in 
front of League II with seven 
wins and two losses after aver
aging 750 pins a game to take all 
three from the TXs, Citcom grab
bed two games after dropping the 
first to Welch Hall. And the Delts 
surprised the PiKAs by walking 
away with two thirds of their 
days matches.
Greasy Stone 
Does It Again
Carnegie Tech ran into a big 
surprise in their game with Slip
pery Rock and were dumped to a 
sad tune of 69-41. Tech in its last 
go against the Greasy boys were 
edged out by a slim margin of 3 
points in losing 51-48, and for 
that reason were expected to put 
up another strong battle with the 
possibilities of even winning.
The game started out in true 
cut-throat fashion with Levy 
dropping in a foul shot after only 
3 seconds of the game had elapsed. 
However Dutkin started the ball 
rolling with a push shot from the 
side to give Slippery Rock the lead 
which they never relinquished. 
The balance of the first quarter 
was very close with Tech tying 
up the game at 7-7, 9-9, and 11-11. 
Both Watson and Meyer made 
two beautiful long shots to keep 
Tech in the running, while Ortman of Slippery Rock was hot 
stuff for 9 counters.
The second quarter was also 
close, however, it was marked' by 
some erratic passing and too many 
crazy shots. There also was a gen
eral tendency for individual play 
instead of close team work, some
thing which has been lacking for 
quite some time now. When the 
teams trotted off the floor at in
termission time, it looked as if the 
game would really turn out to be 
a thriller for the score was 27-21 
in favor of Slippery Rock. A no
ticeable factor at this point was 
that Biletkinoff, high-scoring for
ward for Slippery Rock, had been 
held to 6 points.
However the second half started 
off with a bang when Slippery 
Rock dropped in 3 quick baskets 
before Marck dropped in one to 
make the score 33-23. The score 
was gradually built up until at 
the end of the third quarter, Tech 
was behind by a score of 48-35. 
Our 3 vets, Levy, Marck and 
Meyer tried desperately to keep 
Tech in the game by scoring 4 
points apiece.
With the start of the 4th period 
all hell broke loose when every 
man on the Slippery Rock team 
seemed to be injected with a high 
octane as for they scored 14 
s oints before Tech realh objective in the game.
G terck of Tech dropped
a iter in to stop the onsL 62-37, however, that
di the Phys. Ed. boys for
loi se they dropped in 7
mt ts to make the score
Tech Quint Staves Off 
Late Case Rally to Win
Red Silvermans clan had enough stamina to stave off a tremendous 
rally by the Case five last Saturday and register their fifth win of the 
current campaign, 44-41. The game was one of the dullest seen around 
here in a long time with both teams playing very sloppy ball.
Ho Humm
The small crowd which was on 
hand to witness the game got a 
preview of what was in for 
them the moment the game start
ed. Case grabbed the tip-off and 
started .to work slowly against 
Techs zone. They couldnt get 
anywhere, but neither could Tech 
penetrate Cases territory. George 
Meyer finally broke the ice by 
tapping in the rebound on Wat
sons foul shot. Kanda, the visit
ors big, husky center, did the same 
for his team, however, and Tanis 
dropped a foul sihott to give Case 
the lead. Two more foul shots and 
another bucket by Case in the 
course of the next five minutes 
gave them a 7-2 lead, as Tech 
continually th^ew the ball away. 
Then the Tartans caught fire for 
a time and Marck and Levy piled 
through six quick points to give 
the home (team an 8-7 advantage 
at the quarter.
More Ho Humm!
Kanda tied things up at the out
set of the second stanze with a foul 
shot, but Marck put Tech out in 
front again by popping a short 
one through ithe hoop. Marty Chet
lin came through with a good free 
throw for Tech and Miller did like
wise for Case. Howie Levy came 
up with a neat piece of dribbling 
to beat the Case defense for a layup, but again Case countered to 
match the Tartans and Kanda got 
loose for a lay-up, then took a 
rebound, pivoted and swished his 
shot to give Case two more points 
and tie matters up at 13-13. Mil
ler gave Case the lead again as he 
took a pass directly under the 
bucket and tossed it through with
out looking at the basket: Lew 
Heiles came right back for Tech, 
however, and swished a long set 
shot. Sanow, the visitors big 
boy, got loose under the hoop for 
a lay-up but Chetlin came right 
back for Carnegie witih four 
straight points on a bucket and 
two fouls to give the Tartans a 2- 
point margin at the half.
Chetlin, Kanda Shine
Kanda started the second half 
off for the visitors with a free 
throw, but again Chetlin was 
right in there for Tech and he 
came through with a beautiful 
over-the-shoulder shot from the 
foul circle. A little later, the East 
Pittsburgh Kid bagged two more 
points on a pop shot and Levy 
made it 24-18 with a good foul
69-39. At this point of the game 
the spectators pleaded for substi
tutes from the Slippery Rock team 
so as to keep the score down. The 
game ended with Lew Heiles 
dropping in two field goals to 
make the final score 69-41 
(Whew!)
The crowd of 750 was fair for 
a mid-week game, however, more 
than half were from Slippery 
Rock, and we do mean women.
To offset the sadness of the 
game we wish to point out that 
in Techs last game with Slippery 
Rock, Kuzma and Harmuth scor
ed 16 and 14 points respectively 
which would have been a welcome 
sight at this game.
Three beers to George Meyer 
and Lew Heiles for their excellent 
playing of the ball off the back
boards.
Two beers to George Marck for 
being high point man the second 
week in a row with 5 field goals 
and 2 foul shots for 12 points.
shot. Kanda again got loose under 
the Case hoop to tally a lay-up, 
but Chetlin, who played himself 
a whale of a ball game throughout, 
put the crusher on Case as he 
dropped a set shot and a foul to 
give Tech a 27-20 advantage. Levy 
and Heiles took up the quest from 
there and got six more points be
fore the half ended, while the best 
Case could do was three.
All of which gave the Tartans a 
ten point margin as the fourth 
quarter got under way. George 
Meyer put Tech further in front 
with a neat pivot shot, but the 
visitors countered with two free 
tosses. Then there began a free 
scoring exhibition witih both 
teams just dribbling down the 
floor and tossing the agate 
through the hoop. Marck started 
it for Tech, followed by Miller 
for Case and Levy for Tech. Kan
da came right back for the visit
ors, but Levy also swished an- j 
other one and the Tartans now 
had a 41-29 margin.
Tartans Coast In
The Tartan Iteam now seemed to 
be content and all looked dead on 
the floor. The visitors took ad
vantage of the situation, as Tanis 
got four quick points for them. 
Marck and Watson combined tal
ents to get three of the poin/ts 
back, and the score stood 44-33, 
as the clock showed about two J 
minutes to go. Case now caught r 
fire and dropped a lay-up and d" 
three set shots for a total of 8o3
straight points. But the Tartans 
were a little too far ahead and 
wound up taking their second vic
tory of the season from the Cleve
landers.
Sidelights on the Game: Levy
and Chetlin between them ac
counted for 27 of Techs 44 points. 
Howie had 15, Chet 12.
Watson was the influence which 
keptt Tech in the game in the sec
ond quarter. The Tartan forward 
got a big percentage of the re
bounds under both baskets.
Chetlin turned in one of his 
best games of the season and was 
a big factor in holding the team 
together when they all started to 
go ito sleep.

THE CARNEGIE PLAID
GIVE TO 
THE RED 
CROSS
Page Edited by Evening School Students of Carnegie Institute of Technology
Reflections
It does not seem so long since 
Tech announced the Carnegie En
dowment Fund whereby Carnegie 
Institute of Technology was to re
ceive for every dollar donated the 
sum of two dollars from the Car
negie Corporation up to the maxi
mum total of $12,000,000. Do you 
remember how far into the future 
it seemed when Dr. Doherty set 
the goal of $4,000,000 by June of 
1946? Well, here we are in March 
of 1946 and the goal is almost in 
sight. But I have often wondered 
if all of us have done our best, not 
only in helping personally towards 
the fund, but also in calling the 
matter to the attention of other in
terested people.
In those days we were probably 
wondering whether Tech would 
beat Pitt, and whether Carnelly 
and Condit would be able to play 
next Saturday. That was back in 
the days when a person could go 
down to the corner and buy a fivecent hamburgerback in the days 
when a girl didnt pine for a date 
with a boy friend. We were at 
peace, secure in our own smug 
complacency that all would be 
hunky-dorey. A salary of $200 to 
$300 per month was something to 
behold and to hold. Uncle Sam 
didnt want 20% of it, then. In 
fact, to pay income tax was a 
mark of distinction reserved for 
the privileged. But that has all 
been changed. No more discrimi
nation! Now every one has the 
privilege of paying his 20% in in
come taxes.
And speaking of taxes, NOW is 
the time to avail yourself of some 
legal deductions in your tax re
turn. Lets donate to the Endow
ment Fund and take the deduction 
in our tax return.
Plan Get Together
Although the registration fig
ures for the second semester have 
not shown a large growth in the 
number enrolled, they do show 
that we have some more students 
now on the campus for more in
struction. This means that there 
are more people interested in ad
vancing their knowledge at the 
sacrifice of time, energy and the 
usual social activities. But the 
time is not wasted, rather, it of
fers splendid opportunities for 
making contacts which would nor
mally not be possible.
In this connection it might be 
mentioned that there are many 
possibilities of forming associa
tions with our classmates, and with 
others whom we meet on the cam
pus and on the way there. There 
are many opportunities of meet
ing people on the campus dur
ing the evening, and in this 
manner it would be possible to 
advance the extra-curricular ac
tivities which at the present time 
seem to have a difficult time 
keeping going. Of course, it is go
ing to take some time for things 
on campus to return to a sem
blance of what they used to be, 
but its coming.
Along the line of making con
tacts, forming associations, etc., 
the possibilities are present of or
ganizing an evening school soror
ity for the women who attend 
these classes. Some thought 
should be given to this project and 
more will be written later.

Interviewing
Well, well, look whos coming 
up the hall. None other than Bettey U. Oberg. Just in time, too, 
Betty, for we were looking for 
someone to interview this even
ing. Now dont back away like 
that; we wont hurt you. All you 
have to do is answer a few sim
ple questions. Okay, then lets go, 
for all the evening students are 
anxious to hear about you.
Betty is a native of Pittsburgh, 
hailing from the East End. She 
has short, curly brown hair, 
brown eyes (which change with 
the weather?), and is 5 feet 4 
inches in height.
Betty is a Jill-of-all-trades. 
During the day she does detailing 
and stenographic work at the 
Blaw-Knox Company, and enjoys 
her work very much. She attend
ed Tech night school a few years 
back in the Fine Arts Depart
ment. In the mean time she was 
enrolled in the Engineering 
School at the University of Pitts
burgh. Now we are glad to have 
her back at Tech once again tak
ing Psychology.
As for her hobby, Betty likes 
to paint in water colors, and 
spends quite a lot of her spare 
time at it. She likes all sports, es
pecially ice skating. Another fav
orite pastime of hers is dancing. 
She is serving as a hostess at the 
Variety Club Canteen at the 
Pennsylvania Station. Her favor
ite hangout is Camp Laurel 
Ridge.
Betty tells us she likes people. 
We can well understand that; with 
her very pleasing personality, we 
doubt if theres anyone with whom 
Betty couldnt make friends.
Of course we couldnt let her 
escape until we found out what 
her favorite is, and we find shes 
another shrimp eater.
We want to take this oppor
tunity to thank Betty for giving 
a helpful hand in making our so
cial activities successful events.
Well, folks, the next time you 
see that person with a cheerful 
friendly smile, youll know shes 
Betty Oberg.
Betty Ashcraft 
Assoc. Editor
We hear the boys got stuck 
with the paper a couple weeks 
ago when the Ed, the Assts. Eds, 
etc., couldnt be there. Claim they 
even had time for some elbow 
bendingif they are that good 
they can have the job! We are 
still wondering what prompted 
hiding two lone rulers in the 
typewriter hole."
Ches, the ever versatile, has 
been skiing up in Rolling Rock 
how about taking us with you 
next time, lad?
The Heat Power class met at 
the William Penn Hotel on Thurs
day evening to hear a lecture on 
the Steam Turbine Locomotive. 
After the meeting, the class could 
be found in any near-by sudsbar.
Heres a stickler (?) for you 
If Churchill, Stalin, and Truman 
are walking on the White Housj 
lawn in two feet of snow, what 
time is it?
Rosemary, the Whistle Kid, 
and Dorothy, who did a nice job 
on the 8-ball last week must have 
found more interesting bait else
where tonight. We liked to see 
you out, girls, and will reserve 
two seats here for you next week.
Now Im calling it quits, theres 
a garden outside which looks in
viting. Bury me deep, men.
Oh, yes, the answer to the 
above  Stupid, look at your 
watch!
Mo e Dreaming
I an. not a golfer so when I 
daydrea \ it is not with thoughts 
of a sill stick and a little ball. 
(I alway, did wonder what satis
faction a 4 ^rson could derive from 
hiking ov> * hills and dales and 
every noM and then taking a 
whack at . ball.) I dream of 
floating dow a beautiful river in 
a canoe on a moonlight night with 
maybe a portable radio or a phono
graph supplying soft dreamy mu
sic. The croaking of the frogs and 
tadpoles blend with the little song 
of the cricket to add to the har
mony of the sounds of the night 
that are heard after the world goes 
to rest.
Ah, yes! I am the romantic 
type, not the over-ambitious golfer 
type. Soft music, mellow evening, 
canoe, thats for me. I can almost 
hear the music and am blissfully 
content. Its thoughts like these 
that makes ' life seem wonderful 
and peaceful and not in a turmoil 
with everyone rushing to get here 
and go there. Perhaps you, too, 
are a day dreamer such as I. If so, 
I would be happy to share my 
canoe with you. Climb aboard.
Florence Elizabeth Ashcroft. 
Perhaps you know her by just 
Betty as all of us here at the 
PLAID do. Her position as Asso
ciate Editor is a fulfillment of one 
and a half years previous work on 
our publication. The many posters
you see advertising Evening Stu
dent Council Activities are painted 
by Betty, the Publicity Chairman 
of Evening Student Council.
Betty came to Pittsburgh six 
years ago from Clearfield (the 
cold country) in order to study 
fashion illustrating at the Art In
stitute of Pittsburgh. She has 
been at Techs Evening School for 
three years studying painting and 
drawing, oil painting, and intro
ductory psychology. At present 
she is employed by Gimbels as a 
commercial artist doing childrens 
drawings for the newspaper ad
vertisements.
Betty likes to sew, read, write, 
collect classical records, hear good 
music, see good plays, collect Jon 
Whitcombs magazine illustrations, 
and keep up her scrap books on in
terior decorating and home eco
nomics. Food, a secret yearning, 
rates highly with Betty. A prime 
favorite, shrimp salad, just never 
loses its charm for her. Home 
made ice cream and hot rolls will 
always have a place in her heart. 
Squash is her only aversionshe 
simply doesnt like it!
During the war Betty worked 
on a Salvation Army Trailer Can
teen and distributed coffee, dough
nuts, and sandwiches to Army per
sonnel stationed in or passing 
through Pittsburgh. She took a 
Red Cross course so that she could 
go into Army hospitals and sketch 
the wounded servicemen who were 
there for convelescence. After all 
of this, she still found time to be 
a hostess at the USO-Variety Club 
Canteen.
Her ambition is to take an over
night hike and to go to a kinder
garten and sketch the youngsters 
unobserved, but she can never 
seem to find the time to do so. 
Betty wants to own a piano and a 
new shiny sketching board some
day. But the one thing she will 
absolutely have nothing to do with 
is a skunk chubby, her only real 
pet peeve.
When Betty leaves the PLAID 
office every Friday night, she goes 
to her three-room apartment in 
Cor op ol is. She shares it with a 
blond room-mate and insists that 
the two of them are good cooks 
and enjoy housekeeping.
We know that Betty will always 
have many friends for she has that 
naturalness which attracts peo
ple. Her laughing eyes and 
friendly ^mile are always welcome 
here at the PLAID office. Betty 
has ability, too, for in the absence 
of our Editor she carries on quit 
capably in getting material for the 
paper and in setting it up for the 
printer.
Good luck to you, Betty, and 
may you always have success in your chosen field.

Were all in favor of a March 
recess but the administration 
doesnt seem to agree with us so 
well just suffer in silence (?) until 
Easter (hubba, hubba). But, we 
cant complain about boredom, 
thanks to the fraternities and so
rorities.
The Beta Sigs had a First of 
the Month Dance Friday night 
at their house on Observation 
Comer. Stan Kohn, their auditor, 
played postman by disitributing 
bills to everyone. Five of the 
Beta Sig Glee Club members re
hearsed their songs for the Sun
day night broadcast, and they 
surrounded the crowd.
In conclusion of religious em
phasis week, the A. E. Phis gave 
a dinner Thursday night for the 
Beta Sigs and the Tau Delts. The 
dinner was held at the Union and 
Milton Susman was the speaker of 
the evening.
Friday night the D. U.s had a 
house dance. Their juke box pro
vided the music and the D. U.s 
did the rest.
This past week end was a big 
one for the Thetas. They left for 
South 'Park Friday evening and 
spent the week end at the Girl 
Scout House. There was lots to do 
because the weather was nearly 
perfect. Some of the more am
bitious gals went horesback riding 
and others batted a ball around. 
Everyone partook of the wonder
ful food which the food crew pre
pared. (Poor kidsthe cooks or 
the other characters?)
In closing their activities for 
Brotherhood Week, the PiKAs 
gave a dinner on Wednesday, Feb
ruary 27. The gues/ts were Dr. 
Johnstone, Professor Ellis, Mr. 
Shear, Mr. Hannum, and Rev. 
J. R. Henderson of Turtle Creek.
Saturday night the Pitt and 
Tech PiKAs celebrated their 
Founders Ball. Harry Ransom and 
Bob Graham were commended for
Carnegie Tech campus is a very 
distinguished place. One of the 
main reasons for this distinction is 
that Carnegie Techs cafeteria has 
the longest lunch lines in town 
after McCanns cafe downtown of 
course. Speaking of McCanns, 
Carnegie Tech puts McCanns but
ter lines to shame. The butter line 
moves forward slowly, surely, in
exorably. But does the lunch line? 
To answer that we will ask yet 
another question, Have you ever 
stood in the lunch line? If you 
have, you know the answer. 
Bridge fiends have had time for 
complete rubbers of bridge while 
waiting hopefully for their lunch.
The chief troubles with the line 
are the parasites who have con
genital difficulties which prevent 
them from standing in the lunch 
line. Their willing and eager 
friends either get lunch for them 
or save them a place near the sil
verware. Of course the poor 
suckers in the end of the line won
der why so many people pour out 
past the cash register but nobody 
seems to get in to get lunch. Dont 
anybody tell them what happens, 
or they too might try to find a 
friend who does not have a class 
before the twelve-thirty lunch 
hour.
Some of the Margaret Morrison 
dieticians have been heard to re
mark that eating at Skibo is not
healthy because the students do 
not pick well-balanced meals. The 
loaded trays flowing past the cash 
register belie this fact. People 
pass there with such wholesome 
loads as three salads, three sand, 
wiches and two pieces of cake, 
Anybody could exist on that, but 
after reading the above paragraph, 
one wonders why the third fellow 
didnt get any cake. Thats all be. 
side the point. The point is: who 
can afford well-balanced meals? 
But enough has been written about 
that. It no longer belongs in any 
well-organized gripe by a starving 
reporter about the difficulty of ob* 
taining food at Skibo.
So the student has ordered  
balanced meal. Can he eat it 
now? NO!!! Why not? Because 
the cafeteria help are funny about 
their plates being carried to class. 
By this time the student is cky 
if he has invested his hard-earned 
money in a sandwich which can 
easily be eaten on the way. By 
this time too he is lucky if he can 
have a mayonnaise sandwich. The 
fat and happy Maggie Murphs 
have taken all the calory-laden 
cream-cheese-and-nut-bread and 
have left the engineers (who have 
to go to class once in a while) to 
starve. But what happens if the 
student has a two hour lunch and 
has time to eat it decently? He 
has no place to sit down. The 
usual place is uncomfortable If 
there is any spot to put it. Any
way, there are too many bridge 
games and hard-work.ing engi
neers. And who wants five aces 
and the tail end of a slide rule in 
his split pea soup?
Other minor details make Skibo 
an uncomfortable place in which 
to try to digest a wholesome lunch. 
Cheerleaders jumping up and 
down on your table and putting 
the toes of their shoes in your 
chocolate cream pie do not make 
for tasty chocolate cream pie.
As one engineer said, about 
Skibos lunches, The fewer the 
better, or Come wiz me to the 
Cas Bar.

And a happy March to all you 
tired Techites! What with every
thing, we were unable to keep 
abreast of current events, and it 
came as a complete surprise to 
us to hear that Woody Trautman 
has been pinned, or if we must 
be formal, engaged to Reta Callery for several weeks. . . . And 
speaking of innovations, have you 
heard about the tremendous new 
organization on campus? It is 
the D. R. R., the Daughters of the 
Russian Revolution, whose plat
form is Fluorescent lighting in 
the salt mines, and whose battle 
cry is Back to Euphoria! They 
are looking for a mens auxiliary. 
. . . Recurrent Couples: Ernie 
Allen and Peggy Nelis, Jean 
Lisle and Augie Binder, A1 Leh
man and Doris Friedlander. . . . 
Gil Raffaeli must be bitterhes 
looking for a bachelor apartment.
. . . Seen in Skibo: Celeste mak
ing pipe-cleaner figures for her 
17 (seventeen) children. (???)
. . . Everybody writhed in agony 
when they saw Joel Bigelmans 
hair cut. He fell asleep in a bar
ber chair, and now looks like 
Ingrid Bergman in For Whom 
the Bell Tolls. The Tau Delts 
seized upon this opportunity to 
paint their kitchen with him. . . . 
The West Virginia mountaineer, 
Jack Bosley, has had a pretty 
rough time trying to live in 
advanced civilization. The side
walks are hard on his bare feet.
Much weeping, wailing and 
gnashing of teeth among the 
womenthey have finally realiz
ed that Manuel is gone for good.
. . . Dotty Tattersalls fiance
came down from Detroit to see 
her. Result: bliss. ... Jo Svirman had quite a party last Friday 
night, didnt she Hannah? . . . 
Proof of Tech girls magnetism: 
Three of those classy McGill 
lasses attracted dates all the way 
from Cleveland, and a handsome 
Ensign came from a faraway city 
to see Jane Hussey. ... Di
ogenes Laskerides is beating his 
brains out over his marriage re
lations course. Does he have 
plans? . . . The girls at Linden, 
not to be outdone by the PiKAs 
who have another pet, (see Frat 
Flashes . . . plug) have adopted
as their mascot a perfectly charm
ing young man; by name, Whitey 
Coyle . . . And what has Elek 
Hartman got that all the girls 
love? Could it be his Lily-whit
er jokes? . . .
We of the Tartan apologize pro
fusely to Chuck Sutton for calling 
him Jack in last weeks pub
licity for the King of Hearts, and 
also to Herb (T. R.) Saiger for 
mispelling his name. Hes been 
cussing us ever since. . . . En
sign John Krummell circulating 
between the Delt house and Bar
bara Owens. . . . Ken Welsh is 
back. . . . Ditto Bruce Carlock. 
Jim Garner, and Charlotte 
Youngs Jack. .
re-establishing the PiKA chapter 
at Tech. The guest speaker was 
State Senator John Wallier. John 
L. McCannfi Dean of Pitt Law 
school, acted as Toastmaster.
The PiKAs would like to an
nounce the opening of a contest 
to name their new dog. Any sug
gestions for the name of the pup 
should be submitted to any PiKA. 
A sizeable prize is offered. (It 
sounds as though the PiKA house 
is starting a kennel)
Friday night tthe Kappas gave 
a dance for the Betas, Delts, and 
PiKAs.
