Bar Tartan Reporter From Council
Editorial
Definition of a Newspaper
The Carnegie 'Tartan has begun to look and read like a 
newspaper.
Majority student reaction to this change appears to be 
favorable so far. But questions have been raised in Student 
Council concerning certain aspects of this change.
And some members of Council have decided that they dont 
like the change at all, as witness the lead of story of this issue 
and its accompanying banner headline. The very intemperance 
of the disagreement, expressed by a fortunately unsuccessful 
attempt to muzzle the Tartan, indicates that the difference of 
opinion is fundamentalthat of the definition of a campus 
newspaper.
Since the Tartan Editorial board is the primary deter
minant of the policies of the student newspaper and intends 
to continue in this capacity, a definition of policy appears to 
be in order.
The Carnegie Tartan proposes to function as a distinct 
campus entity, and to report and evaluate the news as seen 
by the newspaper staff.
Everything which our reporters can discover is considered 
fair game for at least a preliminary writeup. Evaluation of 
the stories turned in, of the individual parts of these stories, 
and of their positioning in the newspaper, is then the exclusive 
right of the Tartan Editorial board.
Since the Tartan proposes to*----------------------------------------------------
become a newspaper with a per
sonality of its own rather than a 
mechanical framework on which 
other organizations can hang 
whatever pleases them, we de
cline to publish in our news and 
editorial columns anything which 
can be called publicity.
If an individual news story hap
pens to act as favorable publicity 
to Ahe activity whose affairs it re
po, ts, then an extra dividend has 
been passed without conscious in
tent.
A good illustration of this pol
icy at work appeared in the last 
issue, when the Beaux Arts in
vestigation was placed at the top 
of the Student Council story.
This placement had as its back
ground the last several years of 
Student Council history, during 
which our student government 
functioned as a rather squashy 
rubber stamp for whoever cared 
to push.
Signs appeared last year, how
ever, which indicated a revival.
These signs were strengthened

Victory Hoped 
For Case Game
Next Saturday, November 8, 
Carnegie Tech will have one of its 
best opportunities to score a foot
ball victory since the sport was 
dropped here during the war.
On that day, Coach Donohoes 
charges travel to Cleveland to en
gage in a battle with the Rough 
Riders of Case Institute of Tech
nology.
The Rough Riders, led by Coach 
Ray Ride, have been anything but 
rough these last few years. L.ast 
year they lost six games while 
winning one. The win came at the 
expense of Carnegie by a score of 
28-0. So far this season the Sc
ientists have been unable to cop 
a victory. By comparative show
ings, the Tartans should be fav
ored to win if they play the game 
of which they are capable.

Beaux Arts Ready To Go Places 
This Year9% Says Jerome Bell
Jerome Bell
Beaux Arts is really prepared to go places this year, stated 
Jerome Bell, the member of Student Council who suggested the tab
ling of the Beaux Arts budget at the October 23 Student Council 
meeting.
I spoke to the new group in Beaux Arts during the week, he 
said, and they were unhappy over the light in which the organiza
tion appeared to have been placed in last weeks Tartan.
In fact, Bell continued, the Tartan seemed to have conveyed an 
exaggerated impression of my interest in Beaux Arts.
I was not interested in mak
ing an expose, he declared. I 
simply wanted to focus attention 
on Beaux Arts policy and de
termine if there has been any 
change from last years policy. 
Feeling that on the basis of 
last years record, the organiza
tion did not ju^ify its continued 
existence, bell said, he wished 
to pursue the question further be
fore the Beaux , Arts budget was 
approved, for another yesrmwiiate" approval might be mere
ly result in a year which would be 
a useless repetition of the previ
ous one.
Meetings were held and pro
posals were advanced, he noted, 
but nothing was ever done about 
the proposals, and there was rare
ly a quorum present to conduct 
business under any circumstances.
And of course there was rare
ly any enthusiasm.
Further explaining his previ
ous objections to the Beaux Arts 
budget, he pointed out that ae[Continued on page 4]

Kenneth Hall. Although the pri
mary purpose of the party is to 
provide a headquarters during the 
Homecoming celebration for non
fraternity graduates and students, 
we want to extend an invitation 
to everybody who will be here to 
celebrate with us.
Bill Ward, social chairman of 
Citcom, in general charge of the 
affair has arranged for Bernie 
Armstrongs orchestra to play for 
dancing and for the Mens Glee 
Club quartette to furnish the in
termission entertainment.
Carnegie Tech gridiron vic
tories of the past will be the 
theme of the party. A decorations 
committee headed by Mabel Brit
ton will be in charge of decorat
ing the gym.
It is hoped that this party will 
make possible the attendance at 
Homecoming of many hundreds of 
grads who at other celebrations 
had no place to go for the after 
the-football-game celebration.
Citcom also hopes to be able to 
make a substantial contribution to 
the Kiltie Band for the profits ex
pected from this affair. The Clan 
obtained permission at the last 
meeting of Council to use threequarters of their profit for this 
purnose.
Kenneth Hall, president of Cit
com Clan, represented his organ
ization at the Council meeting 
which gave Citcom both the date 
for its affair and provided far-the 
unusual financial arrangements.

Citcom Takes the Lead
We are gratified to see that Citeom has 
come to life after we had almost given it up 
for dead.
The action that has been taken by the com
muters, in conjunction with the Kiltie band, 
of sponsoring an all-school Homecoming party, 
is potentially one of the greatest boosts that 
could be given to our annual celebrations. All 
of us know that these have in the past left 
something to be desired.
Lacked Drive Last Year
Last year it seemed to us that Citcom had 
been reduced to a smug, self-satisfied clique 
to whom real progress and the acceptance of 
expanded responsibilities were alien terms.
If this is truly an about-face and the Clan 
continues to show the same leadership that it 
has demonstrated in this instance, it may soon 
attract a much larger proportion of the com
muting students by offering them real benefits 
through the one organization that exists solely 
for them.
Salute New Vigor
We salute the leadership that has for once 
warmed the cold shoulder that CIT habitually 
offers.
Citcom has set the pace by giving the com
muting members of the student body a live 
wire organization. We would like to see the 
new Clan continue to grow.

when the student body elected to Council some 
of the best and most active men on campus.
Thus two potentials had been set up, one 
of historical expectancy, and another, almost 
as strong, of immediate action. But potential 
does not make the best news, and thus, when 
the relatively weak Interhonorary council was 
actually investigated, a certain portion of this 
potential was transformed into news. ,
When Beaux Arts, the Fine Arts activities 
honorary, was being investigated (Jerome 
Bells focusing atention is stil an investiga
tion,) proof of the vitality of the new Coun
cil had finally been established, and the poten
tial built up by years of Council and other or
ganizational inactivity had suddenly been re
leased as news.
Once this perspective has been established 
the fact that the first Beaux Arts discussion 
occupied but a few minutes of Councils time 
becomes insignificant.

Carl Klahr
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
The drums of war are beating again. As day 
melts into day the low rolling staccato grows 
louder, but the background music in our lives 
drowns it out. Who the composer of this danse 
macabre is we do not for a cer
tainty know, nor do we know what 
purpose it will serve.
It is very easy to pin the blame 
on one individual or another, on 
one set of thoughts or another, de
pending, of course, within what 
national fences one sits. It is very
easy to say, too, that this is in
evitable; that during the entire
course of history there were set 
up antecedents, of which the thing 
now being forged will be the con
sequent. For what we say is mere
ly a matter of speculation, but what the mills of 
the gods grind out is as sure as hell fire.
I am not normally a pessimist; I am the sort 
of person who likes to think that happy days are 
here again, who likes to believe in an unending 
plateau of prosperity. But to be an optimist now 
is to refuse to face facts. The drama that is being 
enacted at the United Nations meetings, and in 
every city of Europe, is according to our best 
authorities a cold warthe preliminary period
in which the opponents glare at each other before
springing at each others necks.
It is a matter of statistical record that when 
weapons are manufactured they will be used. 
When billions of rubles and dollars and pounds 
are spent on standing armies and faster jet-pro
pelled planes and stores of plutonium, these will 
be used in battle, just as surely as every arma
ment race in the past culminated in war. Well, what 
is the solution; for our country to disarm? That 
will simply make us softer meat for their teeth.
It is interesting in an abstract scientific sort of 
way to know what it feels like to live with a 
sword hanging overhead; to wake every morning 
like the inhabitants of ancient Pompeii who would 
look towards the smouldering volcano and say, 
This is another day it has given us. It is in
teresting, but resignation is a virtue only for the 
doomed. False optimism, on the other hand, is a 
virtue only for professional do-gooders who have a 
living to make.
It is very discouraging that an attitude of in
tense but restrained alarm, which alone can find 
ways and means to save us, has not appeared. If 
enough people become sufficiently scared of war 
not of defeat alone, but of war itselfand make 
themselves heard sufficiently early, why then peace 
will be worth betting a quarter on.
From the Exchanges
Although there has not as yet been any violent 
reaction to the new look in womens fashions 
here at CIT (at least not enough to warrant an 
editorial outburst in the Tartan), it would seem 
that at other colleges, as reflected in their news
papers, the world-shaking controversy rages 
fiercely.
At Renssalaer Polytechnic, according to its 
journal of the same name, a campaign (conducted 
by the men of course) is under way to ridicule 
the Gibson Girl long skirt by reviving the 
male style of the voluminous moustache, which 
also flourished in that era. Their slogan is Pawn 
that Shick today, and the whole paper is dotted 
with ads commanding  Grow a Beard.
An editorial in the Akron Buchtelite of the Uni
versity of Akron shows a more resigned attitude, 
commenting sadly, . . . low hemlines, like women 
drivers in the middle of the street, are here to 
stay, and apparently no power on earth will move 
them. So about the only thing to do is to send 
a nice gilt-edged certificate to the Little-BelowThe-Knee Club in Dallas, for their noble if vain 
effort, and resign ourselves to the perfidy of femi
nine logic. <
In a columji headed Style Slaves, Arise in 
the Temple University News a number of some
what vituperative remarks were addressed at the 
Temple coeds, the clothing manufacturers, and the 
fashion designers in Paris and elsewhere. The 
tirade concluded, . . . what with voluminous 
lengths, multi - itnkle strap wrapping, waist - dis
solving Atomic foundations, camouflagehued 
stockings, bustle drapings, anderother items of 
misrepresentation, every date is a blind date.
The Bucknellian of Bugknell University contain
ed a half page spread, complete with new and 
old picture, and a number of interviews. One of 
those interviewed commented, The New Look has 
this advantage over the Old Peek: it suggests an 
era of quiet contemplation, free from unscholarly 
distraction.
But I Only Wanted Coffee!9
Letter to the Editor
Alma Mater Needs New Tune
Dear Sir:
There seems to be, and perhaps 
has been for some time, a move
ment in progress to change the 
tune of our Alma Mater. Since this 
is my first year at Tech as a day 
student, I cannot recall, at this 
moment, a single note of the 
tune in current use; however, I 
feel no need to blush for this 
shortcoming inasmuch as (so I 
have heard) there are many alum
ni who cant remember just how 
it goes.
But I did hear, and even sang, a 
proposed new tune at the regular
ly scheduled choral ensemble class. 
Regardless of what the present 
tune may sound like, I am sure 
that Mr. Leichs Here where 
spangled wilder-NESS-es is no 
improvement.
Both *Mr. Leichs melody and, 
apparently, Dr. OBriens melody 
lack the most essential and most 
desirable quality of any alma ma
ter tune, namely, familiarity or 
remember-ableness. To be or 
become familiar after merely one 
or two hearings, a tune must have 
more than just simplicity of mel
ody.
It must also have few melodic 
and rhythmic variations; that is to 
say that the familiar tune must 
have as much repetition of mel
ody and rhythm and as few 
changes in these elements ^s it is 
possible to have without becom
ing trite and uninteresting.
From the viewpoint of the music 
student, Mr. Leichs setting of the 
Alma Mater has many nice quali
ties. In the sincere and conscienti
ous manner which endears Mr. 
Leich to the entire music depart
ment, he has laboriously endeav
ored to make the rhythm fit the 
natural pronunciation of the syl
lables and to make the melody 
follow the thought and mood of 
the words.
This he has done very well; but, 
as one might expect, such a free
style setting contains scarcely any 
melodic repetition and very little 
rhythmic repetition.
In fact, the only twice-repeat
ed rhythm pattern is one that 
only the upperclassmen in the 
music department (having at least 
a year of Solfeggio and Eurythmics) could be expected to sing 
correctly at sight. Having heard 
or sung Mr. Leichs tune at least 
five or six times in close succes
sion only two days ago, I find 
that I cannot remember all the 
notes and rhythms accurately.
If a music student is unable to 
catch the tune with so many 
hearings, how could the student 
body be expected ever to mem
orize it?
I dare say, it would take the 
average student four years of per
fect attendance at all functions 
where the Alma Mater is played 
or sung to memorize this propos
ed tune.
As we all know, Tech has a very 
fine music department, having on 
its faculty some of the best mu
sicians and educators in the mu
sical world, and comprising a se
lect, hand-picked student, group 
chosen from a host of talented 
applicants.
Because of this condition, it 
would seem fitting (on the sur
face) that the T#ch Alma Mater 
have an original melody, com
posed by some active member of 
the music department. Idealistic
ally, this is a good thought, but, 
unfortunately, not practical in this 
situation.
Familiar tunes of favorite 
hymns, national anthems of other 
countries, and other national folk 
tunes have been used over and 
over again for high school and 
college alma maters.
The public loyes these tunes, or

The newly chosen book and 
score for the 1948 Scotch and 
Soda club production will be in
troduced to club members at an 
organizational party in the Grill 
of Carnegie Inn next Sunday af
ternoon, November 9, from 2:30 
to 6:00,
The party is being given by the 
Scotch and Soda executive board 
for over 200 students representing 
every department of the school 
who combined last year to pre
sent Rock n Riot, the first post
war edition of Carnegies annual 
musical comedy.
Though the party is primarily 
in appreciation of last years 
work, plans for the coming year 
are to be discussed and selections 
from the new show are to be pre
sented to the club members for 
the first time.
The book and score for this 
years original musical comedy is 
to be selected today by the ex
ecutive board from the entries 
submitted in Scotch and Soda 
clubs annual script contest. An
nouncements of the contest were 
posted last spring with the dead
line set fpr October 31.
The selection of the new show 
will enable the board to execute 
plans for the year. Preliminary 
work has been underway since 
the beginning of school, but now 
with the book and score chosen 
the club will have something to 
work on.
Calls for talent will go out soon. 
Participation in the Scotch and 
Soda musicals is by no means re
stricted to the membership in the 
club. Membership is awarded at 
the end of the year to everyone 
who helps in the production.
The show is scheduled for the 
week of May 10 with perform
ances to be given in the Carnegie 
Music hall. Work will begin be
fore Christmas with full rehears
als underway by March.

Amateur Psychologists Study 
Brain Foods Ef fect on Rats
Students Experiment With Glutamic Acid 
In Unsupervised Project To Raise IQs
The most intelligent rats in the 
world are at Carnegie Tech.
Working independently of the 
administration, a grouR of ama
teur psychologists here is carry
ing on an experiment to deter
mine the effects of brain food, 
glutamic acid, on the intellectual 
capacities of rats as demonstrated 
by their mazerunning abilities.
At present the group consists of 
Bob Van Nice, Dick Drisko, Shir
ley Seiner, Viera Kulamer, Harry 
Silverman, and Carol Watt. How
ever. the group will welcome a 
few interested persons as co
workers.
It all began because Bob Van 
Nice had a girl in New Jersey 
who likes pets. By devious means, 
Van Nice convinced Clara Herron 
and Viera that it would be nice 
to raise some rats for experi
mental purposes.
Since Van wanted to have only 
intelligent rats, it was decided to 
experiment with glutamic acid. 
The acid had been found to raise 
the IQs of nearly all people using 
it, so the investigators were curi
ous as to its effect on rats.
Three females and seven males 
(rats, that is) were obtained gratis 
from Shadyside academy, which 
also loaned cages and a maze. 
Four additional females were pur
chased shortly thereafter.

Secret Service was first pro

and continued its successful run 
later in New York. William Gil

wrote the play as a vehicle for 
himself.
The drama department has se
lected Secret Service especially 
because of the problems which 
are offered in acting and scene 
design. The play will be staged 
in the manner of the original pro
duction.
This 1896 acting style calls for 
the players to play to the audi

the players with this technique. 
Scene design also offers a problem.

will be able to provide an outlet 
for the political aspirations of 
time-restricted students.
In the hope of further reducing 
the distinction between veteran 
and non-veterans, Tecvets will 
sponsor intramural teams and so
cial events in friendly competi
tion with Citcom Clan, the dormi

should help to alleviate this situa
tion.
Also on the list of purposes is 
the continuance of the work done 
by the original organization in 
giving assistance to veterans en

Hoping to operate Tecvets as a 
veterans organization for as long 
as is .practical, Steiner expects that 
it will be ultimately reorganized 
once more in order that all stu
dents may participate.. Another 
name would then be selected to 
indicate the change of the activ
itys status.
When questioned about the re
sponse to his move to reorganize 
Tecvets, Steiner said A lot of 
interest has been shown. Many 
men have called me at my home 
and have spoken to me in class, 
saying that they like the idea and 
are interested in the organization.
I hope, in fact, that it will be 
possible to call a meeting shortly, 
and to proceed with our plans in 
cooperation with Harry Thor, who 
is now president of the organiza
tion.
ficient for this task, so the serv
ices of psychologist H. Karn of 
the social relations department 
faculty were enlisted to demon
strate the basic techniques.
The females were bred to ob
tain a colony with scientifically 
controlled heredity and environ-' 
ment. The four youngest males 
were selected for the preliminary 
running of the maze. Two of them 
were fed glutamic acid, and the 
other two were not. The main 
purpose of this was to teach the 
experimenters the proper pro
cedures. In the words of Drisko, 
The rats learned faster than we 
did.
Problems came thick and fast. 
One of the rats had no ambition 
whatever, taking a three-hour 
nap while halfway from entrance 
to food-box. This was the only 
incident of its kind, however, and 
one rat set a record of twelve sec
onds for running the entire twen
ty feet of maze.
The rats had to be weighed at 
frequent intervals. With their na
tive exuberance, they frolicked on 
the pan of the scale, with the dis
traught experimenter attempting 
to obtain accurate readings from 
the oscillating beam. A cardboard 
ice cream container, obtained from 
the corner drugstore, inhibited the 
rats movements sufficiently to en
able the scale to be read.
At present the research is being 
continued on the fourth floor of

Standings Remain The Same 
In Intra-Mural Touch Football
Standings were the same this 
week with last weeks leaders still 
showing the way. Kappa Sigma 
of the American League came up 
to tie Citcom for the lead. Sigma 
Nu added a game to their win 
column, making their record three 
wins and no losses in the Federal 
League. Tau Delta Phi, inactive 
this week, remains on the second 
rung with two wins and no losses. 
Theta Xi, in the National, was 
also inactive while Phi Kappa, 
idle the first week, stepped up to 
take second place.
Citcom was idle this week as 
their only game was rained out. 
Meanwhile Kappa Sigma made 
their record two wins and no loss
es by beating the luckless Dorm

Carnegie Loses To Presidents, 
Playing Best Game Of Season
Skibo Gridders Capitalize On Breaks To Score Two Touchdowns; 
Intercepted Pass And Blocked Kick Responsible For Tallies
The fighting Tartans invaded Washington, Pa., Saturday, No
vember 1, to tangle with the W and J Prexies before a Homecom
ing Day crowd of 7500. The two teams fought a bruising battle 
which resulted in a 21-13 victory for W & J.
The Presidents scored first on a 68 yard march during the first 
period with Bob Bissell lugging the ball over the goal line on a 
plunge through guard.
The Jays scored twice again before the Tartans could reach pay 
dirt. Bissell again caried the ball over the line for the second W & J 
score after which Walt Cooper ?

Heiland Kicks
Highberger Scores
raced through the line for the 
third. Jackie Wilson added all 
three conversions.
The Skibo gridders capitalized 
on an intercepted pass to score 
their first touchdown. End Bob 
Dougherty made the score on a 
pass from Larry Maley. After re
covering a partially blocked kick 
the Tartans were able to shake 
Sam Highberger loose for another 
six points. Pappafava made good 
on one conversion attempt to 
build up Carnegies total of 13 
points.
First Half All W&J
The first half of the game was 
all W&J as the Plaid was unable 
to get started. Bob Bissell and 
Walt Cooper were the outstanding 
runners while Jackie Wilson did 
some accurate passing. Chuck 
Heberling, Prexie blocking back, 
opened the holes for the runners 
and deserves a good deal of 
credit for the win.
The outstanding lineman on the 
field was the losers right guard, 
Floyd Wiseman. He was the fifth 
man in the Prexie backfield. 
Floyd participated in the game for 
almost the full sixty minutes. Lar
ry Maley was a Tartan star as he 
again successfully led the Skibos to touchdowns once the ball 
approached scoring territory.
Jerry Helland returned to the 
Plaid lineup in the role of punt
er. He got off several long punts, 
the longest traveling almost sixty 
yards from the line of scrimmage. 
Dick DeMuesy gave a very good 
account of himself in a substi
tute tackle role as he drove into 
the Prexie backfield on numer
ous occasions.
President Lead Early
The Presidents moved to an 
early lead as Cooper and Bissell 
crossed the goal line midway in 
the first period. The teams then 
battled to a standstill, but the 
Tartans pass defense weakened 
and Forrest pitched two succes
sive passes to Lewis that put the 
ball on the Tartan three yard 
line. Bissell was again able to 
bull his way into pay dirt a few 
seconds before half time.
The Jays padded their lead in 
the third quarter as Bissell return
ed a Helland punt from his own 
43 to the Carnegie 34. He and 
Cooper then alternated carrying 
the ball to the Plaid 5 from where 
Cooper danced through the Skibo 
line for a touchdown.
Tartans Take Charge
At this point the Tartans took 
charge. Pappafava intercepted a 
Wilson pass on his own 49 and 
advanced it to the Prexie 40. Ma
ley limbered his passing arm and 
completed a short pass to Fran 
Janosky who ran to the 25. An
other pass found Dougherty on 
the 5 and he dashed the re
maining distance for the score.
In the fourth quarter Wiseman 
partially blocked an end-zone kick 
by Urbanic which DeMuesy re
covered on the Jay 16. Sam 
Highberger then tried several 
cracks off his own left tackle and 
finally scored standing up with 
four minutes remaining.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Creguts Sports Scope
Trainer Burt Munhall Retires 
After 34 Years Of CIT Service
Pete Cregut
For the past 
three decades 
the standard op
erating proced
ure for the Tar
tan sport page 
has been to run 
a feature article 
dealing with the 
career of Burt 
Munhall. This 
year it is more 
apropos than 
ever before for 
after this year 
Burt will no 
longer be around. After 34 years 
of mending and ministering to 
Tartan athletes Burt is ready for 
retirement.
He first arrived on the Tar
tan scene back in 1914, direct 
from a job as a railroad engi
neer. The job of trainer had 
been thrown open by the school 
to all applicants and when Burt 
showed up with some 200 let
ters of recommendation he was 
hired.
As the story goes, he had gone 
to school for a year and a half 
at what was then called Western 
University of Pennsylvania, now 
known as Pitt. He had played 
some football there but when 
anyone tries to pin him down as 
to just what position he played, 
about the closest reply obtainable 
is anything between the ends. 
However, reliable reports have it 
that he was generally stationed 
at center.
He had to quit W.P.U. because 
of financial reasons, taking a job 
as a railroad engineer. This was 
followed by his career as an ad
hesive tape engineer.
The real story of Burt Mun
hall, however, is not what he 
did before he came to Carnegie,
but what he has done since. In 
the 34 years he has been here he 
has become one of the outstand
ing trainers in the country. As a 
matter of fact Burt will tell you 
there are none better. And he is 
probably right.
Munhalls reputation is based 
largely on his many innovations 
which have advanced the train
ers art through the years. Burt 
was the first man to use alumi
num for braces. He first employed 
it to reinforce a fractured lower 
arm and ever since then it has 
been in extensive use. There is a 
constant demand throughout the 
country for his various special 
braces.
Burt originated the modern 
manner of taping ankles after 
elastic material had been used 
for years. He designed his own 
massaging table and mixes his 
own liniments.
In his thirty-four year tenure 
his bosses and his jobs have been 
varied. In all he has served under 
six coaches, Baker, Steffen, Wad
dell, Harpster, Kern and Donohoe. He has seen good years and 
bad ranging from 1938 when 
he went to the Sugar Bowl to last 
years scoreless season.
In addition to his usual duties, 
he even had charge of the foot
ball training table at one time. 
Burt ruled over the table like a 
tyrant, making sure that his boys 
got nothing but the best.
He supervised everything from 
the slaughtering of the meat to 
having it put on the table. His 
own size is outstanding evidence 
of the good job he did.
To those that know Burt best 
he is outstanding in his ability to 
tell stories and in 'his droll sense 
of humor.

The DU protest of their game 
with Citcom was ruled out of or

The Beta Sig protest of their 
game with the PiKAs, although 
valid in every other respect, was 
rejected on the grounds that it

Final score: Pi Kappa Alpha 13

would like to request that all man

if you dont laugh hell get you on

Thats part of the story of Burt 
Munhall. To tell all the incidents 
that have made him an institution 
at Carnegie Tech would require 
the better part of this paper. We 
hope that tiie little that has been 
said will be enough to make every
one realize how sorely Burt will 
be missed.
Maley To Williamson 
Sparks Passing Attack
Everybody likes to watch outstanding plays on the gridiron, and 
a teams passing attack lends itself well to these spectacular events. 
Loyal Carnegie fans know by now that the Tartans passes receive 
their initial velocity from the limber arm of Larry Maley. He has 
pitched the passes that have pulled the Plaid out of danger on several 
ocasions and set up the Skibos first three touchdowns.
Larry a veteran of last years squad has worked his way up to 
the starting quarterback assignment. This job is really a tough one, 
for the quarterback on Coach Donohoes eleven usually does most 
of the running in addition to passing and calling the plays. It is 
needless to say that this 19 year old, 160 pound boy is performing 
his duties well this season. ?----------------:------------------------------------

Larry came to CIT in 1945 from 
Wilkinsburg by way of Central 
Catholic high school in Pittsburgh. 
While at Central he was active in 
sports, playing quarterback on the 
school eleven. Last season Larry 
was one of several quarterbacks 
in Carnegies T-formation, but he 
prefers the new duties that the 
present formation gives him. 
Maley in Last Season
This is Larrys last season as a 
football player. He is now a 
senior in the electrical department 
and will graduate next June. He 
has been quite active on campus 
and is a member of AIEE, Varsity 
club, and social chairman of Sig
ma Nu fraternity. During his 
freshman year he was a member 
of the JV basketball team and he 
has always been a competitor in 
all intramural sports.
Every passer must have a good 
receiver if he is to have any suc
cess, and Maley found bis in the 
person of long John Williamson. 
Reaching into the ozone to snag a 
pass is a simple task for big John 
who towers over the crowd with 
his lean body and long arms.
Vital statistics show John to be 
an old man of 26 who packs 180 
pounds on a 6 ft. 3 in. frame. The 
success Williamson has had is 
amazing when we consider that 
he has been playing with an in
jured leg all season.
An Injury a Game
After each game John can be 
seen limping around campus. 
Johns usual schedule is to play 
Saturday, recuperate the first part 
of the next week, get into prac
tice near the end of the week, 
and then play again on the next 
Saturday. This schedule was in
terrupted when his injuries kept 
him on the sidelines against 
W & J.
Williamsons stay at CIT has 
been a long struggle. After grad
uating from Dormont high school 
in 1938, he entered the Carnegie 
evening school. While working 
days he plugged away in night 
school until 1942.
At that time, he enlisted in the

the next four years as a commu
nications officer. John was dis
charged as a captain in 1946 in 
time to return to Carnegie as an 
irregular sophomore in the fall 
of that year.
William Has a Busy Year
Williamson spent a busy year 
after returning to school. His first 
venture was to succeed in winning 
himself an end position on the 
football team. On the heels of 
football came basketball and John 
became a substitute forward on 
the varsity team.
As basketball season passed on, 
rehearsals for the Rock n Riot 
show began, and John displayed 
his talents as a dancer. During 
this period he managed to squeeze 
in activities such as the Varsity 
club, Scotch and Soda club, Cit
com Clan, and intramural sports.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1947
Bar Reporter From Council99 
Mintz Demands At Meeting
[Continued from page 1] 
campaign against the newspaper 
was underway.
But not until Council had 
reached cheerleading did the con
demnatory remarks begin to flow. 
Norman Larsen and Scotty 
Yurchison opened by voicing dis
approval of the coverage which 
the Tartan had devoted to the 
cheerleading situation.
Bar Tartan Reporters
David Mintz followed quickly 
by recommending that Tartan re
porters be banned from Student 
Council meetings. Although pres
ident Marshall promptly pointed 
out that such an action was con
stitutionally impossible, Mintz 
pursued his argument further.
Accusing the Tartan of yellow 
journalism he stated that the 
Tartan was twisting the facts in 
order to make a big blow on the 
front page.
Negley Reed, chairman of the 
publications committee, then en
tered the discussion by remark
ing that the Tartan has been a 
lousy paper for the last four or
five years and that he thought 
the last four or five issues have 
shown a remarkable improve
ment. ^
OHare Praises Efforts of Coverage
At this point John K. OHare 
pointed out that the complete cov
erage is obtaining publicity and is 
adding to the prestige of Student 
Council. Marshall recalled to 
Council that previously nothing 
but the brief minutes of Council 
meetings were published, and that 
the students never had an accur
ate idea of what the Council was 
actually doing.
Minutes Were Published in Polish
He added that as an experiment 
the Tartan had published the Stu
dent Council minutes in Polish 
some years ago in order to de
termine whether or not anyone 
was reading the account. Quite a 
few issues passed before the ap
parent error was called to the at
tention of the Tartan staff.
Concluding his comments, Mar
shall said, It is a school news
paper and they print the news 
the way they see it.
A suggestion was made from the 
floor that the publications com
mittee should exert pressure on 
the Tartan to suppress further 
over-emphasis of similar issues. 
Negley Reed answered the sugges
tion with the statement that the 
publications committee has no 
authority to dictate editorial poli
cies to the publications.
The discussion appeared closed 
after president Marshall directed 
publications chairman Reed to 
discuss the entire matter with the 
editor of the Tartan and to report 
back to Council at the next meet
ing. However Bruce Murray took 
the floor and suggested that the 
preceding discussion concerning 
the Tartan and Student Council be 
off the record, whereupon a spon
taneous cry of protest arose from 
the free press element present. 
Murray Not Muzzling 
Accused of muzzling, Murray 
made the statement, I dont 
want to muzzle anyone.
OHare gained recognition from 
the chair and went on record as 
being in favor of the reporting of 
everything that occurs in Coun
cil. 
The issue was finally dropped 
after Marshall again stressed the 
advisability of keeping nothing 
from the student body.
The cheerleading investigation 
came into focus with the appear
ance of Scotty Yurchison, the rep
resentative of the varsity cheer
leading squad.
Yurchison tossed his hat into 
the ring with the statement that, 
I did not come here to be the 
subject of an investigation. I 
came here on my own. [Council 
had invited Yurchison to appear 
at the meeting to represent the 
cheerleaders.Ed.]
Questioned as to the method 
used to select cheerleaders during the recent tryouts, Yurchison 
explained that the varsity squad 
had conducted the elimination 
tryouts and that the finals had 
been supervised by a faculty 
committee.
What Does He Mean?
John Ewart, addressing a ques
tion to the chair, queried, Who 
does he mean by saying we 
when he says we eliminated?
Yurchison repeated that the 
varsity squad had conducted the 
first elimination tryouts, where
upon Ewart suggested the revi
sion of the system of choosing 
cheerleaders, and shortly after
ward questioned whether there 
is any reason for cheerleading be
ing under the athletic depart
ment.
He pointed out that cheerlead
ing is definitely a student activity 
and in his opinion should be un
der the jurisdiction of Student 
Council. Yurchison voiced his be
lief that the athletic department 
is the only department equipped 
to handle cheerleading.
David Mintz changed the course 
of the discussion temporarily by 
noting the lack of student enthu
siasm at pep rallies. Council 
members responded with a num
ber of remedial suggestions. 
Yurchison Suggests 
Asked for his suggestions, 
Yurchison proposed an organiza
tion to coordinate the rallies, and 
added that it would be wise to 
give sohieone the authority to call 
a pep rally.
Marshall wanted to know, If 
you are not the man to call a pep 
rally, who is. The answer was, 
I would like to know that too. 
After some further discussion, 
president Marshall expressed his 
opinion that Student Council 
could not possibly have any juris
diction in the case. We can, 
however, appoint a committee to 
support pep rallies, but it is up 
to the head cheerleader to call a 
rally.
Marshall Appoints Committee
Marshall then appointed a tem
porary school spirit committee 
headed by David Mintz. Norman 
Larsen and Scotty Yurchison were 
also appointed to the committee 
and a Tartan representative will 
also be asked to serve in order to 
secure the cooperation of the Tar
tan for publicity.
Discussion of the reported in
ternal dissension in the cheer
leading squad was terminated 
with the decision that a recom
mendation be sent to Mr. Over
end that someone be given man
agerial powers over the cheer
leading squad.
Before leaving the meeting 
Yurchison requested that some 
steps should be taken to put the 
cheerleaders back on their feet 
after being knocked down, re
ferring to the cheerleading story 
in the October 28 issue of the Car
negie Tartan.
President Marshall expressed 
the regrets of Council. We cant 
re-do what already has been 
printed in the Tartan.
Bell Retracts 
Before introducing to the 
Council, Lee Kirk Watkins, presi
dent of Beaux Arts society, Je
rome Bell retracted his statements 
of the previous week. I am com
pletely satisfied with the organiza
tion as it stands, said Bell, and 
I recommend that their budget be 
approved as it stands.
Mr. Watkins prefaced his own 
remarks with the statement that 
I dont quite understand what 
the question was concerning our 
organizational budget. I cant un
derstand how it was approved one 
year and turned down the next. 
Continuing, he voiced dissatis
faction with the fact that last 
year his organization was forced 
to spend most of its time giving 
an account of its activities to 
Student Council.
Issue a Directive
He suggested that the Council 
issue a directive informing cam
pus organizations what their ob
ligations are to Student Council.
Council approved the Beaux 
Arts society budget as submitted.
Early in the meeting, John 
Ewart presented a petition from 
Citeom Clan to hold an all-school 
dance in the gymnasium the night 
of November 15.
After a protracted discussion, 
the Clan was given permission to 
hold an open-house party in the 
Mens Gym on November 15, and 
to keep one-quarter of the profits 
from the affair, giving the re
mainder to the Kiltie Band.
The meeting was adjourned at 
9:15 p. m., following approval of 
a one semester reduction of 10 
points (to 30) of the Scimitar 
eligibility requirement.

This Time for Keeps
Student Council Is Important 
To Evening School Students
Colleges Have One Or More Representatives 
To Present Student Problems To Faculty
Among the many organizations and groups on the campus, the 
Evening Student Council is the most important to evening students. 
Its purpose is three-fold: to act as a go-between between faculty 
and students; to establish unity among school departments; and to 
promote social functions on the campus for evening students. Through 
the council, evening students keep their views foremost in the minds 
of faculty. Each college has one or more representatives who are vot
ing members, thus forming a unit^ 
by which the Council has the 
power to act as spokesman before 
the administration.
Aside from its important func
tion of keeping the administra
tion well-informed as to the stu
dents needs, it is the backbone 
of most evening school activities.
Through the Plaid, which the 
Council sponsors, the student 
body is informed of school news.
The staff of the Plaid is compris
ed of evening students who volun
teer their services to the Insti
tute and meet every Friday night 
to organize the news page for the 
following week.
, The Council exercises considera
ble control over student activi
ties. The various dances, picnics 
and social functions sponsored by 
the evening school orginate in the 
Council and it is its responsibility 
to see that they are *well planned 
and operate smoothly.
Evening School fraternities, so
rorities and other groups must 
be recognized by the Council be
fore they can organize and func
tion.
The Evening Student Council 
acts as a unit, binding the evening 
school together. To act as a unit, 
it must have the cooperation not 
only of its members, the admin
istration and faculty, but also the 
support of the individual student.
Technical
Evening students are remind
ed that the October issue of the 
Carnegie Technical, featur
ing articles on Weather Fore
casting and Practical Wave 
Guides, will continue on sale 
at the book store for the re
mainder of the week of Novem
ber 3, and may be obtained 
from a self-service stand there 
for 25 cents per copy. The next 
issue of the Technical, spon
sored by Tau Beta Pi, will ap
pear early in December.
Differences Must Be Buried 
To Stand Against Communism
By William Wallace
It seems timely during these days of investigations, namecallings, and general misunderstandings regarding political affiliations 
to clearly illustrate the meaning of the word liberal. Of all the 
words that are kicked around in this crazy world no one gets more of 
a booting than this word liberal.
Every crackpot, every panacea-monger, every Pink, and every 
Red poses as a liberal. If John has a boil on his head, the reac
tionary would ignore it, the radical^- 
would cut Johns head off, the lib
eral would simply treat the infec
tion.
Far be it from us to try to di
vert attention from the danger 
of Communism. Its avowed pur
pose is to overthrow, either by 
deceit or by violence, every ex
isting government and to substi
tute a puppet state with Moscow 
pulling the strings. It is the big
gest lie ever told to humanity.
But in these finger-pointing 
times Communist has become a 
handy smear word foif sincere,
God-fearing, progressives, just the 
same as Nazi or Fascist was a 
tag for anyone of the opposition 
a few years ago.
In an exclusive article in the
June 9, 1947, issue of Newsweek, 
J. Edgar Hoover distinctly states 
what a Red is and how he oper
ates. According to Mr. Hoover, no 
organization is safe from a Com
mies infiltration. The more weight 
the organization carries, the hard
er will the Red try to squeeze out 
the present leadership, take over, 
and swing the group to the party 
line. Nothing is sacred to a Red. 
He will worm into church socie
ties, fraternal organizations, labor 
unions, or any other perfectly le
gitimate group. Not only will he 
infest already established organ
izations, but will start his own 
little front clubs, giving them 
pious and patriotic titles. The

Thirty-Two Graduate 
With Spring Class
Council President Declares Class of 1947
Worthy of Honors Given By Administration
May 25, the day on which graduation exercises were held, 
will be long remembered by many former evening students. 
Each year these exercises are well-represented by members of 
the evening college. The 32 graduates, who attended a total of 
211.5 years, have behind them an enviable record.
Mr. Mihelic, a veteran in evening classes and president of 
Evening Student Council, recent-*
ly remarked in regard to our 
graduates, These students are 
worthy of the honor bestowed 
upon them by the Administration. 
That their records are good is 
shown by the 2.41 average factor 
of the group. Many of our even
ing students have achieved out
standing success, which we like 
to feel is one result of attending 
evening classes.
Frank Monks was graduated as 
fourth honor student in all day 
and evening engineering and sci
ence classes for the B.S. degree. 
Both Mr. Monks and Harold Gassner, mechanical engineering, were 
elected to Phi Kappa Phi, national 
honorary socity.
Steven Marcinizyn, winner of 
the evening student achievement 
award, is now teaching thermo
dynamics, evening mechanical 
engineering class.
Pi Tau Sigma, national honorary 
for mechanical engineering stu
dents, has claimed for member
ship Charles Ehrlich, Harold 
Gassner, and Steve Marcinizyn, 
all graduates of this years class.
Those graduating in May of this
year with a B.S. degree in chem
istry were Samuel Colbeck, Wil
liam Hake and Frank Monks; 
civil engineering, Michael Breve 
and Harold Fulmer; electrical en
gineering, John Henderson, Frank 
Lacaria and Norman Naley; man
agement engineering, Anthony 
DePrisco, Mark Maxwell, Andrew 
Wayda and Francis Young; me
chanical engineering, Joseph 
Agardy, Charles Ehrlich, Harold 
Gassner and Stephen Marcinizyn; 
and metallurgical engineering, 
James Aites, James Cametti, 
Michael Orehoski and Anthony 
Talento.
Those graduated with master 
of science degrees were James 
Harrison, chemistry; Robert 
Dodds, mathematics; and Louis 
Laushey, civil.
John Donald, Ruth Ebken, 
Thomas Ryder, Edgar Trapp and 
Cyril Wirtner graduated with 
master of fine arts degrees; while 
Howard Bolden, Lloyd Ostrander, 
Sister Francis Raphael Swain and 
Alma Weise graduated with their 
masters degrees in music educa
tion.

The bidding:
SWNE
lcIs2cpass

Openinglead:ueen ofspades.
Whenever a no-trump contract 
goes on the rocks, the cry is in
variably, The finesse didnt work; 
the ace was in the wrong place or 
some such lament. How many 
times the contract could have 
been brought home despite these 
adverse conditions is not record
ed, but they are certainly num
erous. One such time is the hand 
above, which your writers kibitzed 
in Skibo recently.
Bidding Normal
The bidding was normal enough. 
South, whose hand was too strong 
for an opening bid of one notrump, chose to open in his unbidable club suit rather than in 
hearts, in order to make it easier 
for his partner to respond on a 
questionable hand. After the 
raise, he was fully justified in 
immediately contracting for game.
The opening lead was taken 
with the king of spades, and de
clarer immediately followed the 
old adage of first setting up his 
longest suit. The ten of clubs was 
finessed in dummy, East winning 
with the king, and returning his 
last spade, which took out Souths 
last stopper in that suit. Now 
declarer could take only seven 
tricks without letting West in 
with the diamond ace, upon which 
the setting tricks were cashed in 
spades.
Simple Arithmetic
A moments thought and some 
simple arithmetic on the part of 
declarer would have saved the 
contract. The only way in which 
the contract could be set was for 
the club finesse to lose, and for 
West to be able to run three spade 
tricks. If West were able to take 
three spade tricks, he must have 
originally held five spades which 
would leave only two for East. 
Therefore, declarers only worry 
in the hand was to keep West out 
of the lead after the last spade 
stopper is knocked out. Wests only 
possible entry is the ace of dia
monds, since if he holds the club 
king, it can be finessed. The win
ning play is, therefore, to knock 
out the ace of diamonds before 
the club finesse is taken. West 
will win and clear the spades, but 
then when East gets in with the 
club king, he will have no spades 
to return to his partner, and the 
contract will be assured.
In almost every hand, it is that 
moments thought, given before 
the first card is played from dum
my, that spellsc the difference 
plus and minus on the score-sheet.
Communism
[Continued from page 7] 
Communist has only one end in 
mind: To create dissensien, dis
trust, confusionto divide and 
rule.
If we Americans dont feury 
our petty differences and jwft up 
a united front against this trick
ery, well be easy. prey. Iftstead 
of angrily calling each other 
names, we should gain a thorough 
understanding of C<?inmuniwh, and 
then send any admitted Red to 
Russia to enjoy the Utopia he 
would like to foist on the rest of 
the world. *
But true progressives and lib
erals axe the best citizen; any 
could possibly have.
