After The Game 
Dance To Be Held
Something new is coming to 
Tech next week in the form of an 
After the Game dance to be held 
in place of the .Christmas Dance on 
Saturday, December 5. Billy Le
roy and his orchestra will provide 
the music for the dance which will 
be held in Thistle Hall following 
the first game of the basketball 
season.
The new Carnegie five will open 
the season against the team from 
Waynesburg. The dance will be
gin immediately after the game and 
will last until one oclock.
Bill LeRoys orchestra is well 
known about town as the Town 
Tattlers, and is a favorite at Tech, 
having appeared here with increas
ing frequency in the past year. LeRoys smooth arrangements are 
definitely for dancing.
This new dance is to be held in 
place of the scheduled Christmas 
Dance. The After the Game 
dance is expected to create more 
interest since it follows the open
ing game of the basketball season. 
The dance is being sponsored by 
Student Council, and the cost of 
admission will be reasonable.

Youngest Member 
Of Antarctic Trek 
Talks at Assembly
Speaker at next Tuesdays as
sembly in the Little Theater will 
be Harrison H. Richardson, young
est member of the last Byrd Antartic Expedition.
Mr. Harrison, who is at present a 
pre-medical student at Geneva Col
lege, has with him several reels 
of film, mostly in technicolor which 
show some of the highlights of Ad
miral Richard E. Byrds 1940 trip 
to the Antartic. Among these will 
be such scenes as the unloading of 
the giant Snow Cruiser, the setting 
up of the base camp, an,d the un
forgettable panorama of the frozen 
Antartic.
Admiral Byrd says of him, Rich
ardson is a very splendid young 
man of intelligence, efficiency, and 
character; in fact he is one of the 
best men I have had with me on 
my five expeditions.
Richardson was one of the group 
of men who traveled 850 miles by 
dog team from the permanent camp 
to a vast ice-bound region where 
the temperature often dropped to 
76 degrees below zero, and the 
wind attained a velocity of 60 miles 
per hour.
Besides the movies, Mr. Richard
son will bring with him an inter
esting] display of clothing and 
equipment used on the expedition. 
This assembly is under the super
vision of Jack Satterfield, chairman 
of Student Council assembly com
mittee.

Vacation Dates Given
Due to several inquiries at the 
Registrars office concerning the 
dates for the resumption of classes 
after the Thanksgiving recess and 
Christmas vacation, it was discover
ed that the dates for resuming these 
classes as given in the Handbook on 
page 10 are incorrect.
The official date for the opening 
of classes after the Thanksgiving 
recess is published in the official 
calendar of the Institute as Monday, 
December 1, at 8:30 A. M. The offi
cial date for the opening of classes 
after the Christmas vacation is 
Monday, January 5, at 8:30 A. M.
These dates are given correctly 
in the back of the Student Hand
book on pages 131 and 136.

Telling the truth is like going 
around a dangerous cornr. This 
statement sums up the theme of 
Dangerous Corner, the next Little 
Theater Production for the Tech 
Drama Department. Written, by J.
B. Priestly, the play will open Fri
day, December 5, and will run for 
eight performances, including a 
matinee on Friday, December 12.
The story opens with a group of 
very respectable people sitting 
around a dinner table and discuss
ing a book entitled "The Sleeping 
Dog. The thesis of the book is 
that telling the truth is apt to re
veal embarassing facts about a per
sons past life; in other words it is 
best to let a sleeping dog lie.
One of the characters, Robert,
believes that the truth -should be 
sought out at all costs. In the
course of the play he is proved
wrong, for certain instances in the
past lives of these seemingly re
spectable characters are revealed 
which would ruin them if the truth 
were known by their associates.
Dangerous Corner is a psycho
logical drama of character and emo
tion; and, as such, departs from the 
spirit of other plays by J. B. Priest
ly that the Drama Department has 
presented in the past. When We 
Are Married was given last year, 
and proved to be one of the most 
popular plays of the season. Time 
and the Conways is another Priest
ley play that has been shown here.
Another feature of the produc
tion is the fact that, for the first
L53EYH3 35IIEHY3 2 2 2
2 2 2 iCNMEH 1EHUoNH
time this season, the sets are being 
designed by a student. Marvin 
Einhorn, 42, is making his initial 
attempt at scene designing.
Douglas McClean is the faculty 
instructor who will direct the play. 
Costumes are being designed by 
Elizabeth Schrader Kimberley. The 
head technician is George Kimber
ley.
Doris Bloomberg, 43, and Phyllis 
Fineman, 43', are double cast as 
Miss Mockridge. Robert, the dis
ciple of truth, is portrayed by Rob
ert Challener, 42, and Thomas 
Jones. 43. Alwen is played by 
Jane Lloyd-Jones, 42, and Ann

This morning at eleven oclock, 
the annual Carnegie Day program 
was held at the Carnegie Music 
Hall. Scholarship holders, mem
bers of the faculty and the student 
body attended the 29th annual ob
servance of the birthday of Andrew 
Carnegie, founder of the Institu
tion.
The invocation was delivered by 
the Rt. Reverend Alexander Mann, 
Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
Mr. J. II. Kindelberger, a mem
ber of the class of 1920, and presi
dent of North American Aviation, 
Inc., offered greetings from the 
alumni. President Doherty deliv
ered the main address on Forfeited 
Values.
Following the announcement of 
scholarship holders; trophies were 
awarded to the fraternity, sorority, 
and dormitories having the highest 
factor in the past year.
Four honoraries made their calls 
during the exercises. Phi Kappa 
Phi calls were made by - Dr.- Har
old Lang; Tau Beta Pi calls by 
Arthur Handlos; Theta Tau calls 'by 
William Hanna; and Eta- Kappa Nu 
. calls by Albert Kriitschcr.
Music during the program was 
played by the student orchestra un
der the direction of J. Vlclc OBrien 
and the organ prelude and., postlijdo 
were played by Ruth Seifert '42.
Changes Suggested 
For Union Offices
Due to the fact that the CUT hi 
now a recognized publication, and 
duo to the long existing fact that 
the.THISTLE does not have suffi
cient space, the committee recom
mends the following changes in the 
location of the various publications' 
offices.
1. The present TECHNICAL office 
shall .become . the- office of the 
SCOTTIE.
2. The room now occupied by the 
SCOTTIE and adjacent to the 
present BAGPIPER office shall 
become the Technical office.
3. The present THISTLE office and 
the remaining previous office of 
the SCOTTIE shall become the 
combined offices of the CUT and 
the THISTLE.
4. The offices of the DORM BAG
PIPER and the TARTAN shall 
remain the same.
The committee also recommends 
that each publication be given three 
keys to its respective offices, and 
that these three keys be distributed 
to the various three responsible 
representatives of that particular 
publication. The three representa
tives shall be chosen by due pro
cedure within the organization 
itself.
At no time is the master key to 
all the publications offices locks to 
leave the hands of the responsible 
representative on the premises.
Former Student 
Gives Address on 
Aviation and Defense
Representing the alumni at the 
Carnegie Day exercises at Carnegie 
Music Hall today will be Mr. James 
Howard Kindelberger, President of

Following the program, Mr. 
Kindelberger will be guest of hon
or at a banquet luncheon to" be

many of his former classmates and 
other D. U. alumni are expected to 
be present.
This evening Mr. Kindelberger 
will again speak; he will be guest 
speaker a:t the annual Carnegie 
Day banquet of the Alumni Asso
ciation. The subject of his- speech 
will be Aviation and Defense." I-Iis 
many years of experience in the 
field of aviation and his present 
prominent position in the industry 
make him well qualified to speak 
on tills subjoct. Toast mastev nt 
this moating will be Mr. R, J. W'ca^i, 
president ol! the Wean Engineering 
Co. of Warren, Ohio.
Mr. Kindelberger has been pres

been largely through his effort that 
this company has become one of 
the largest in the industry, At the

Marshall Price, 42. Molly Van 
Ameringan, 42, and Patrucia Nad
ler, 44, are cast in the role of Freda. 
The part of Betty is played by Betty 
Bieberson, 44, and Jean Layton, 
43. Richard Rose, 44, and Norman 
Apell, 44, fill the role of Stanton, 
and Christopher Smith, 43, and 
Wilfred Thunhurst, 43, act as Gor
don.
Dangerous Corner requires but 
one setting for the entire show. The 
scene of the play is the interior of 
a wealthy publishers home. The 
set will be made to resemble a liv
ing room with wood panelling. Mr. 
Lloyd Weninger is supervising the 
designing.
Marvin Einhorn, who is designing 
the set for the play, is an acting 
major who is also interested in di
recting. He feels that his experi
ence gained in designing will stand 
him in good stead in his later work 
as an actor and. director. It is 
best for one to know as much about 
various phases of the theater as 
possible, whatever his specialty may 
be, Marv believes.
During the past summer Ein
horn worked at the Cain Park The
ater, an open-air theater in Cleve
land Heights, Ohio, which seats 
about 4,000 people. Marv feels that 
the future of the theater in America 
lies with such projects, which can 
offer good stage productions at pop
ular prices.
Einhorn has just finished play
ing a starring role in New England 
Picnic, as the Polish prince. He 
will also be remembered for his 
performances as Antipholus of 
Ephesus in last years production of 
 A Comedy of Errors.

iTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1941
nVOs Hk Ouw PawO 
Fkw NaOiknal DVfVnsV
Due to the i!act that our editor is attending a convention in St. 
Louis with other college newspaper heads, we must take our pen in 
hand to sub for him. We hope you will not be too harsh in your 
judgment oil us.
Today we celebrate the one hundred and seventh anniversary 
of the birthday oi! Andrew Carnegie, that grand old man who 
foresaw the need of such- an engineering school as ours. We are sure 
he would want us to help with the problem that concerns our nation 
at the present timethe problem of national defense. Recently, 
Student Council and the other organizations on campus were con
tacted by Martin Chworowsky and asked to help with. National De
fense. As a result, first aid classes have been established for both 
faculty and students, and a Defense ^Committee has,been appointed.
We feel that still more can be done in this respect. The keynote 
of the program should be conservation. Often in our laboratories a 
student is careless with equipment, materials, and supplies; things 
which now are at a premium. Experiments that have to be repeated 
also cause useless waste. Paper is scarce and should be carefully 
used. By making what we have last longer and exercising care in 
itories, we can do our part in national conservation and at 
time become better students for the effort.
: 1 'i is yet another way that we can help. Engineers, skilled 
Vo me use of certain instruments, and designers are needed to aid 
in the construction of new shops in the Pittsburgh area. By ap
plying to the Student Employment Bureau, a student can find out 
where he is needed and work out a schedule whereby his school 
routine need not suffer. Girls, too, are needed since many new office 
positions have been created. Let us see if we cannot do more in this 
great national program. J. 0. T.
Letter to the Editor
one of the boys
.  . Tom RileyCff The Cuff
D6ar Editor:
...In a recenit issue of the TAR
TAN there was a letter to you, re
garding <the policy of the TARTAN 
.'concerning publishing article about 
the outside world and reducing the 
emphasis on campus activities. I 
must admit 'that there are several 
very good points in this letter. It 
is true that there are many things 
going on in the world that the col
lege student ought to know about, 
and it is true, that many college 
.papers all over the country do 
present digests of the events of the 
week. . This is all well and good.
. The newspapers of every town, 
village, and hamlet in the United 
States, Canada, and every coun
try of the western hemisphere tell 
in blazing headlines how far the 
Germans are from Moscow, or about 
how many bombs the British Air 
Force dropped on Berlin the night 
before. Every college student 
hears on the radio every fifteen 
minutes What President Roosevelt 
last decreed, or what tax was add
ed to fathers expenses. J'io one 
has any difficulty in finding' out 
what is going on in the outside 
world.
But many students on this camBltuailiions; if anything is appalling 
on this campus, it is the definite 
lack of Interest of the majority of 
students in the campus activities.
For example, when students were 
asked to vote on the band that they 
wished to have for Spring Carnival, 
only 301 out of a possible 2,200 
students voted. Not only that, but
out of these 351 people, only 291 
expressed their opinions on whether 
Spring Carnival should be extended 
another day of left ait the present 
three days.
Why is this turnout such a bad 
condition1? In the first place, these 
351 students are the ones that 
have decided what band we shall 
have for Spring Carnival. They 
have set the bands, and the other 
students in school who didnt vote 
will have to suffer the consequences, 
if they do not feel that the bands 
chosen are the ones they want. Al
so, 2.01 students might have de
cided that Spring Carnival should 
be extended to four days and that 
a day be taken from one of our va
cations.
Two hundred ninety-one students 
might have decided whether or not 
all the students in school would 
attend school an extra day. This 
is just an example of the definite 
lack of interest of the majority of 
students on the campus concerning 
policies and matters which direct
ly pertain to them.
Because of this situation on our 
campus, I feel that the Carnegie 
TARTAN is doing one of the fin
est inbs nf any rnllpf?f* n^wsnanor
the public and the students to the 
terrible situations around us, but 
let the campus newspaper continue 
to show the students the brighter 
side of life, which is their college 
life.
Sincerely yours, 
CHARLES C. RICHARDSON, 
President, Student Council.

Sat the Red Man, waiting, waiting 
In the frosts of early winter 
For his payment from the Pale Face,
For the payment, as by treaty
For the calico he asked for 
As the price of his surrender.
Then the Great White Father gently 
Spoke and said: Its three yards 
Onlyvthree yards have you com-, 
ing
Its the way that things are rising.
Then the tribesmen muttered sadly, 
All the blessings of the White Man, 
Of the civilized ones have we!
We have economic problems,
We have systematic planning,
We are aided by commission,
We have radio orations,
We have crises fresh each morning, 
We have wars just like the White 
 Man.
NOW WE EVEN HAVE INFLA
TION!

President of the Eeta Theta Pi 
fraternity is sagacious Tom B. Riley. 
Tall, slim, and athletic looking, 
Tom is the type of person shown 
on all magazine covers to entice the 
little ladies to Tech. He has more 
than personal charm, however. 
Last year he edited the Thistle; and 
it has been.rated as one of the best 
of Techs year books.
For the activities column, Tom 
lists Dragons, Alpha Phi Omega, 
and the Rifle Team. There is 
nothing that he enjoys more than 
to hit the bulls eye, and he does 
it just enough to maintain an ac
curate aim. One of the greatest 
honors to come his way was his 
appointment as Lieutenant Colonel 
of the R. O. T. C. Army life inter
ests the laddie and he would like to 
spend a year at camp when he 
graduates, which wish is likely to 
be fulfilled.
He has selected Management En
gineering as his profession, Tom 
cannot explain why he prefers 
liberal arts to engineering sub
jects. Perhaps it is because he is 
social-minded.
Tom modestly says that he was 
not the mainstay of the Beta Intra
mural football team, but his oppon
ents think differently. He was here 
when Techs football teams were 
tops, and for this reason his I want 
a team is sincere.
The only pleasure Tom has to 
suppress is singing. He has a rich 
voice and is always willing to use 
it, but he maintains that his audi
ences have not been very appre
ciative lately.
Tom can always be found at the 
schools dances or the Beta table in . 
the Beanery. Though he varies

his dates for the dances, Virginia 
Bennett hejs taken up quite a bit of 
his time lately, including the Inter
fraternity last Friday.
Experience has made him critical 
of publications, and he feels that 
the ones at Tech could be improved 
with more and better photographs. 
Another of his pet peeves is the 
situation between the Independents 
and the Frats. He feels that there 
should be no rift between them, 
and that if these various elements 
in our state will always quibble, 
there is no point in having a stu
dent democracy. Believing that 
activities are worth the effort, Tom 
tries to stimulate students to par
ticipate in activities.

The comic strips appeal to all 
types of people from six to sixty, 
but whether it is a daily dose of 
Dan Dunn or The Lone 
Ranger depends wholly upon the 
individual. My grandmother, for 
instance, has two favorites which 
she reads as regularly as the clock 
ticks. I have lived with her the 
greater part of, eighteen years, and 
- I have never seen her miss a day 
even if she had to go next door and 
borrow the neighbors paper.
Her number one choice and the 
one she always reads first is Little 
Orphan Annie. She worried for 
days when the little red-head was 
in the grip of the international bad 
man, Axel; and she recovered from 
that adventure only to plunge head
long into another one just as com
plicated and just as terrible. Read
ing Orphan Annie is to her like 
reading a page a day of a novel; 
she does not pick up the funnies 
between dusting and mopping, but 
allots a definite amount of time to 
them. She enjoys this type of 
reading and takes it seriously; she 
is delighted to argue with anyone 
and everyone about the outcome of 
Daddy Warbucks latest venture, 
about what Punjab and the Asp 
will do to the saboteurs, or about 
why Annie has not grown an inch 
in the last fifteen years.

Miss Clara Pomeroy White of 
New York has made a gift of $325 
to the Carnegie Endowment Fund 
for the purpose of establishing a 
memorial to William S. Andrews, 
E. 23, who died last summer after 
many years of ill health.
A veteran of the World War, 
Bill Andrews had been an instruc
tor in the Naval Radio School at 
Boston and later was a wireless 
operator on the destroyer McDermot in the North Sea. At Carnegie 
Tech he was a member of Sigma Nu 
and was one of the organizers of 
the honorary in electrical engi
neering which is now a chapter of 
Eta Kappa Nu, national organiza
tion. He played on the varsity 
hockey team in his junior year and 
-served as a member of Interfraternity Council.
It is Miss Whites desire and pur
pose to perpetuate the name of this 
loyal alumnus by establishing the 
William S. Andrews Scholarship 
Memorial Fund.
In awarding the scholarship from 
the income derived from this fund, 
preference will be given to students 
of the College of Engineering from 
which William S. Andrews was 
graduated.

Tech Reading Lab
,TeNSRT SoN5RH LSIYR5'eSA 
LSATSN 9C 1ACIYE.EHC iSFTM
All students who experience dif
ficulty in reading proficiently or 
feel that their reading technique 
can be improved have been invited 
by the psychology department to 
visit the Reading Laboratory. The 
laboratory is located In room 253 
B, Industries, and is under the cap
able administration of Dr. Simp
son.
Each fall, as part of their place
ment tests, the Freshmen are given 
an examination to determine their 
reading efficiency. Tiiese tests are 
tabulated, and all of the students 
who need improvement are per
sonally invited to attend the lab. 
Although the department contacts 
only the freshmen, it welcomes all 
students. Special attention is given 
-the frosh because he can use the 
correction to best advantage, be
ing able to utilize it for the full 
four years, and he also has a longer 
period in which to attain pro
ficiency. The fact that an upper
classman has successfully complet
ed the first few years is .proof that 
his reading abality can not be too 
bad.
The lab entails absolutely no ob
ligation on the students part, be
ing established solely for his ben
efit. It is open on Monday, Wed
nesday, and Friday, from 9 till 4, 
and on Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Saturday, from 10:30 till 4. Stu
dents who aittend the lab are first 
given an eye examination to re
veal any possible physical disa
bilities. If the department has the 
facilities to correct the defects, it 
will do so; if not, it will refer the 
student to the proper authority.
Often a student is troubled with 
poor reading habits, rather than an 
organic deficiency. This is re
vealed by the pictures which Dr. 
Simpson takes of the eye move
ments. In this case, the student
will be given corrective measures. 
The taking of these tests does not 
obligate the student to make use 
oC the corrective training offered 
by the department, but it is obvi
ously to his advantage to do so.
The effectiveness of the labora
tory was demonstrated by a sur
vey which the Psychology Depart
ment conducted last spring. The 
freshmen who had taken the test 
and the subsequent training were 
compared to a group of freshmen of 
equal scholastic ability who did 
not take the reading tests. The 
factors of the former group showed 
an average increase of one-quarter 
of a factor point more than the un
corrected group. This does not make 
a genius out of the moron, but it can 
mean the difference between eligi
bility and probation, or determine 
whether or not a student will make 
the honor roll.
Chemical Analysis 
To Be Discussed
Next weeks Physics Colloquim 
will be of special interest to mem
bers of the Chemistry and the 
Chemical Engineering department. 
Dr. J. W. Ballard, of the U. S. 
Bureau of Mines, will speak on 
Qualitative and Quantitative 
Chemical Analysis by X-Ray Dif
fraction Methods.
Dr. Ballard is night school in
structor in the Physics Depart
ment at Tech, and for a number 
of years, was a member of the day 
school staff. At present, he is em
ployed by the government for re
search in X-ray and spectroscopy.
All Interested persons are invit
ed to attend this colloquium at 
4:30 P. M., Thursday, December 
4, in room 113, Engineering Hall.

One of the most prevalent ques
tions in the minds of the student 
body in regards to inter-collegiate 
football is, What does the future 
hold for Tech?
First, let us dispel the rumor 
which has been rampant on the 
campus that Tech, in the coming 
years, will play a suicide sched
ule. There has been much talk 
that we have scheduled Navy, Army 
and other schools of high football 
caliber. In 1942 Tech meets 
Geneva, Westminster, Case, Grove 
City, Buffalo, Pitt, and American 
University. Excluding Pitt, our 
traditional rival, all of these schools 
are in our relative class as far as 
enrollment and the quality of their 
athletic teams are concerned. The 
schedule for 1943 follows the same 
general pattern and can hardly be 
termed as suicidal.
On the question of what kind of 
football teams we are going to have, 
I would say, from all that I have 
been able to gather, that for the 
next three or four years, we are 
going to have football squads of 
the same caliber as this years 
team.
That does not mean that we shall 
have teams as good or as bad, de
pending on how one views this 
years squad, as the 1941 team, but 
that for the next few years, Techs 
football teams may be classed in 
the same general plane as our pres
ent squad.
The reasons for this belief are 
twofold. First, the administration 
is determined to give its present 
policy a fair trial in order to see 
whether or not it is a workable 
plan. Secondly, there is no indi
cation that Steffen Fund contribu
tions, in the next few years, will 
reach the point where they can ap
preciably alter the present circum
stances.
The Alumni have been unduly 
criticized, both by the press and 
student body, for not contributing 
more generously to the Steffen 
Fundwitness this years contribu
tion of $850.00.
Alumni Unduly Criticized
We must remember that under 
the present policy of the Adminis
tration none of the gate receipts 
from football games goes into the 
Steffen Fund or into any other sim
ilar fund for the purpose of sup
porting football. The gate  receipts 
are used for the support of other 
inter-collegiate sports and for in
cidental expenses connected with 
the sports program, which means 
that if we are to have good foot
ball teams, the Alumni must con
tribute to the Steffen Fund each 
year.
For instance, if the Alumni de
cided that they would like to see 
Tech once again become a major 
football power, and to do so, the 
Alumni raised enough money to 
bring 15 men to Tech for that pur
pose, in the fourth year, the Alumni 
would have to contribute $48,000, 
(assuming that it would cost $800 
to pay for each of the 60 athletes 
tuition and living expenses). Try
ing to raise $48,000 among any 
group is no mean task and yet that 
would be the job which the Alumni 
Association would have.
The whole question revolves itself 
around the point of whether or not 
gate receipts derived from football 
games should go back into football. 
The majority of the contributors to 
the Steffen Fund feel that gate re
ceipts should go back into football, 
while the Administration presents 
many logical points why they should 
not. (See last weeks article.)
Team Support Necessary
There are those who state that if 
we cannot have good football 
teams, the best course to follow 
would be abolishment of inter-col
legiate footballsimilar to the pol
icy adopted by the University of 
Chicago. This attitude of if I cant 
have cake, I wont take anything 
is one of the silliest and most illog
ical viewpoints presented. We 
should not live with only the 
memory of past glories, but make 
the most of the present situation.
However, it is a different matter 
to abolish football because it is too 
professional and not true intercol
legiate football. This question is 
debatable. As President Doherty 
said, We are not out to reform 
the world, nor is it likely that we 
could do so; and yet any intelligent 
person must realize that amateur 
football is a farce, at least as prac
ticed by the majority of colleges 
in this country.
In conclusion I would like to say 
that no matter what kind of team 
we have we should support it. We 
should make the fellows on the 
team feel that, we are behind them 
100%, and we should be proud of 
the fact that Tech teams are repre
sented by Tech students, who are 
here for an education and not mere
ly for the purpose of playing foot
ball.

The Scarab society will celebrate 
its Silver Jubilee at its twenty-fifth 
annual convention to be held here 
at Tech this coming weekend. The 
dates of the convention are Sun
day through Tuesday, November 
30, and December 1 and 2.
The Scarab society is the nation
al architectural society formed to 
recognize outstanding merit in 
architecture and the allied arts. It 
was first formed at the University 
of Illinois, and has since expanded 
to include eleven chapters through
out the United States.
The convention will be high
lighted by the presentation of two 
awards, the Gold Medal, and the 
Recognition award. The Gold 
Medal award is made to an architect 
who has made some outstanding 
contribution to his profession. The 
Recognition award is presented 
only to members of Scarab, and 
is given for outstanding scholastic 
attainment. Another especially in
teresting event will be the Sketch 
Exhibit. Each of the chapters holds 
a local exhibit and the respective 
winners are brought to Tech to be 
judged. This display will be held 
in the large exhibition room in the 
Arts school and will be open to the 
public.
Classes will be held as usual by 
the department, but they will be 
open bo inspection by the delegates. 
The convention program will start 
with Registration at the Carnegie 
Union, at 9:00 A. M., Sunday. The 
days activities include a church 
service at 11:00 A. M., a tour of 
the city in the afternoon, and the 
sketching exhibit in the Aits build
ing. The first business meeting 
will be held at 9:00 oclock in the 
Union. This will be fallowed by 
a campus tour, a business session 
at 2:00 P. M., and a model initia
tion ceremony and informal dance 
in the evening. The final days 
highlights are the business meeting 
in the morning, and the Farewell 
banquet at 7:00 P. M. in Webster

Medieval Unions 
Is Womens Guild 
Bazaar Theme
Hear ye! Hear ye! The Womens 
Guild announces its annual bazaar 
dance on December 12, from 9 until 
1, in the mens gym. As is ye 
custom, proceeds from the dance 
will go towards sdiolar^hips for 
deserving students.
This year, the Guild Dance theme 
was inspired by the name of the 
organization. Booths and decora
tions will all be connected in some 
way with the medieval trade unions 
(if one may mention unions these 
days).
Bill LeRoy- and his band of trcrnbadors, who have played for past 
Guild dances, will feature his 
smoothie interpretation for ye 
dancing.
All of the womens organizations 
on campus are usually represented 
at these bazaar dances with really 
clever booths. Who can forget last 
years Jingle Belles Ball? Every
one had fun and this year it will 
be twice as muchfun we mean, 
because the price is still the same 
low $1.25 plus tax. Tickets will 
be sold by members of the Guild, 
and girls are especially urged to 
make their dates for this affair, be
cause this is one of the few op
portunities for the womens com
bined groups on campus to show 
their ability in staging successful 
dances.

At the last Chemistry Seminar, 
Dr. J. C. Warner reported that he 
has at last smashed the atom with 
a two base hit. While puttering 
around in his laboratory, Dr. War
ner accidently heated some Barium 
too strongly, and the a became 
separated from the Ea. Alpha 
and Beta particles, as they are call
ed, are numerous; and further re
search will bear out the professors 
speculations that it will be of great 
value practically and scientifically.
'Substances will react with almost 
any letters of the alphabet.
Alchemists in years gone by 
claimed to have produced the stuff, 
tout till now their experiments have 
never been reproduced. The Fed
eral government has recognized the 
usefulness of this startling chemical, 
and is buying all the available sup
ply. A sample will toe put on dis
play soon. Students are advised 
not to touch it since it will hep 
them just like marihuana. Dr. 
Warner expects the Nobel prize for 
his far-reaching discovery.
Since the U. S. has moved closer 
to war, the army has been stripping 
itself of the regalia gathered in its 
lazy years, and is getting down to 
a fighting basis. Indicative of the 
new practical spirit is the Tech R. 
O. T. C. Several weeks ago, it 
drafted a number of Tech femmes 
to serve as honorary cadets, and the 
majority of them were from the 
girls engineering school, Maggie 
Murph. Out of a total of fifteen 
cadets, the army register shows 
that five were Costume Ecs, two 
were Home Ecs, two Household 
Ecs, and' one General Science stu
dent.
The remaining five were from the 
Fine Arts Dept: two Dramats, one 
P. and D., and one Sculpturist. Why 
Costume Ecs should toe in such de
mand calls for an explanation. Is 
the army planning to renovate its
uniforms again, or can the answer 
toe found in the fact that at the last 
fashion show the Costume Ecs stag
ed a military wedding, and with 
the boys in khaki the idea took? 
De-emphasis of artistic things was 
to be expected with the infusion of 
brutality into the boys in the field. 
Art students claim that the R. O. 
T. C. is made up mostly of engi
neers, and that is why 6uch un
imaginative choices were made. 
Then too, the number of girls in 
MM is greater than those in Fine 
Arts. Five Costume Ecs, and four. 
Household and Home Ecs; its still 
unbelievable. Those who are in the 
know just nod their heads, and say, 
Cest la Guerre!
Sampling college opinion on the 
ancient custom of osculation in 
connection with its expose Kissing 
Must Stop, the editors of Swank 
magazine will pay five dollars for 
every letter pro or con in "Swank 
on My Ideas About Kissing. Try
ing to revolutionize American osculatory habits, the article revealed 
that in Japan, it is taboo. Mus
solini bars it in Italy since it is 
bad for public morals, and some 
colleges even banned it; then co
eds went on kiss strikes.
The article asserts that the cus
tom began unromantically when 
Roman husbands on returning home 
brushed their wives lips to learn 
if they had been drinking wine. 
Lip kissing, they claim, is no more 
stimulating than nose rubbing, and 
the thrill springs largely from 
imagination. Then they go on 
about health and disease and re
lated subjects. Their views do not 
jibe with coeds here who say that 
Kissing may not be dangerous if 
you use the right technique. If 
you kiss hard enough you kill the 
germs. And even if it is only 
imagination whats the matter with 
that.

After having waited for several 
months because of defense delays; 
Carnegies Printing Department has 
finally received its new photo-litho
graphy equipment. The two main 
new additions are a twenty-four by 
twenty-four-inch camera and a 
twenty-seven by twenty-seven-inch 
plate off-set press. The lens for the 
camera has not yet arrived, but is 
expected within the next week.
This new machinery will double 
the press and plate capacity of our 
present laboratory; and using the 
numerous new pieces of equipment, 
we will now have three dark-rooms. 
Because of the significance of the 
off-set processes in National De
fense, there were many more appli
cants for the night school course in 
this science than could be accom
modated, and a waiting list has been 
made. Mr. Burchard, of the Tech 
faculty, is being aided by two out
side experts in the instruction of the 
large number of students.
A sample of the departments lat
est work is now being displayed on 
the bulletin board in Industries 
Hall. This job is the cover of the 
Graphic Arts Education magazine 
which is distributed to teachers of 
printing throughout the country.
Address solutions to Ralph E. 
Beatty, in care of the Department 
of Mathematics and drop in the 
intra-school mail box at the post 
office. The solution to Problem 1 
will be published in the next issue 
of the TARTAN.
PROBLEM 2. A somewhat be
wildered freshman was given five 
different chemical samples to weigh. 
This confused young scientist made 
the mistake of weighing the sam
ples two at a time in all possible 
ways. He found for the weights in 
grams of the pairs these values: 
11.0, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 
11.8, 12.0, and 12.1. When he 
showed his results to his instructor 
he was told that it would not be 
necessary to do the assignment over, 
since the weight of each sample 
could be calculated from the results 
that had been obtained. Needless 
to say the freshman was still con
fused.
Can you determine the five cor
rect weights?
This problem is one of a series 
run by the Mathematics Club for 
their contest. Save it and hand it 
in with the others.

FINAL GAME: SKIBOS VS. PANTHERS 
mS co5 OUolC3 4.oNI3 1GEIoN
With the final game of the season coming up in the Staclium 
this Saturday with the Panthers of Pitt, the chances of the Tartans 
winning more than one game seem mighty slim. The Pitt team 
should not be underestimated after the drubbing they received last 
Saturday at the hands of Penn State to the tune of 31-7, for it must 
he remembered that they defeated Fordham, the best team in the 
east, and a strong Nebraska squad.
From all outward indications at the time of this writing, there 
is absolutely no spirit on campus concerning the coming tussle. 
Alpha Phi Omega has been attempting to arouse some feeling by 
passing out lapel tags, but to all appearances, their work has been 
to little avail. Perhaps there will be some spirit generated during 
the final week of practice, which will be necessary if there is any 
hope of putting up a good game against the Panthers. After the 
decisive beating bjr Penn State, Pitt will be gunning for a final vic
tory at any cost, and will be all primed for the Carnegie game.
Except for the opening game, Tech will put the best team on the 
field that they have been able to muster together this season. Every
one is in shape for the game and there are no injuries to cause the 
coaches any loss of sleep.. This is, of course, with the exception of 
Virgil Cantini who was definitely laid up for the1 season with a neck 
injury in one of the early games.
Playing in the Pitt lineup are several players who would be stars 
on any team in the country, namely Ralph Fife and Edgar Jones. 
According to the experts around the city and Pitts opponents, Fife, 
who is a guard but backs up the line on defense, is tops on the de
fense part of the game. Jones does most of the ball carrying and 
specializes in running back intercepted passes for touchdowns.
Plebe Booters 
ilEF Game, 3-2, 
To End Season
Almost discouraging tough luck 
greeted the plebes last Friday when 
they played their final game of the 
Season. The outcome, a 3-2 loss 
for the freshman booters, came 
about in the fourth quarter when 
the Western Pennsylvania School 
for the Deaf scored the two winning 
points. The two goals maae Dy the 
Techites came in the first and fourth 
quarters, being made by Snyder and 
Kovaly, respectively.
The Skibo freshman played an 
exceptionally good game during the 
second and third quarters but seem
ed to let down in the final quar
ter. Playing an especially good 
game was Yaru at inside left and 
Gartner at outside left. However, 
the whole team played an excep
tionally good game aside from the 
letdown in the fourth quarter, 
which was responsible for the loss.
Nelson Crooks, playing fullback 
for the varsity Soccer squad this 
season, was elected captain of the
1942 team by an unanimous vote 
of the members of this years squad.
The prospects for next year do 
not seem too bright if they are bas
ed on the results accomplished by 
this years squad. The team play
ed six games this season and lost all 
six, but the scores of the games in
dicates that each one was a closely 
fought battle. Three of the contests 
ended with a 1-0 scores, which 
shows that the Techites had the

Along with the Thanksgiving va
cation, the Pitt-Carnegie Tech 
game, which formerly was one of 
the most looked-forward-ta games 
in this section of the country, has 
come into the immediate horizon. 
It is difficult to say whether the 
Tartans will make a good showing 
against thg. Panthers as they did 
with the Fightin Irish of Notre 
Dame, but we have reason to hope 
that they will.
Although most of the Skibo root
ers will be away during the vaca
tion, this may be more than offset 
by the fact that this time the squad 
will not start the game while still 
suffering injuries received in the 
preceeding game. This, together 
with the traditional rivalry that has 
existed between the two schools, 
may help to put the Tech team in 
a fighting frame of mind.
Petrella Stars
-Pitt went down in a surprising
ly decisive defeat last Saturday at 
the hands of the Penn State Lions. 
Fans experienced a sharp knock 
when the outcome of 31-7 became 
known. Everyone expected the 
Panthers to keep, at least, the mar
gin small, and most of the follow
ers of the recently rejuvenated Pan
ther fully expected a victory for 
their team. Jones, Pitts Deliv
erer started out in his old style by 
scoring for the Panthers in the first 
quarter, but that ended the rally 
started four weeks ago, when the 
Panthers held the Ohio State to a 
small difference in score.
It was Petrella of Penn State who 
had the stellar role in Saturdays 
local contest and not Postman 
Jones. Although he was not in the 
starting lineup for the Lions, when 
he did get in, he made his presence 
both known and felt, for his second 
period efforts resulted in two touch
downs, making the score at the half 
14-7 in favor of Penn State.
In the third quarter Schmaltz 
acknowledged the fine work of his 
teammate, Pepper Petrella, by mak
ing a 16 yard goal, and to make the 
acknowledgement complete, Ventresco fought his way across the 
Panther goal for the last score of 
the day.
State Line Strong1
It was a victory for the Lions 
both on paper as well as on 'the 
field, for the Penn State team made 
14 first downs to the Panthers 4.

completely eclipsed that gained by 
the Panthers, the ratio being 375 to 
215. Penn State used an effective 
7-2-2 defense against the repertoire 
of Pitts plays. This arrangement 
was so efficient that the adjacent 
university was able to complete 
only one pass in seven, while the 
Lions completed six out of twelve.
Penn States line must be credited 
as being one of the deciding factors 
which played in defeating the Pan
thers. In fact, it was a fumble by 
a back that gave the University of 
Pittsburgh its only chance for the 
score which it made. If it had not 
been for the misplay, It is doubtful 
if the Panthers would have scored 
at all.
Carnegie is putting the best team 
on the field that it has all season 
with the exception of the first game, 
since Cantini is the only member of 
the squad who is not in condition, 
so it behooves aLl those who can

The harriers of Carnegie Tech 
! completed the most successful sea
son in years with the record of 
three wins and one loss. Winning 
in meets over Pitt, Geneva, and 
Slippery Rock and losing to Beth
any, the boys on the team made a 
fine showing. The fact that most 
of the boys are cither sophomores 
or juniors, makes the prospects for 
a line team next year very likely. 
The freshman team will also 
strengthen the varsity. With six 
varsity lettermen and six fresh
men numeral winners, the varsity 
next year should bo one of the best 
teams that Tech had seen in many 
years.
Running one of the most difficult 
courses in the Eastern part of the 
country, the varsity ran all their 
meets in good time. Nick Teresi 
ran the fastest race of the season 
for Tech with a 26:15 against the 
Slippery Rock Teachers. One man 
cannot win a cross country meet, 
however, because the scores of the 
first five men finishing for each 
team are used to determine the win
ner. Every man must run his hard
est in ordgr to insure his team victory.
This year six letters were award
ed in cross country. The lettermen 
are Rotzler, Pritchard, Teresi, Marcin, Volbrecht,. and Puchaski. Man
ager Useller received his letter too. 
The harriers of Tech should be 
complimented for their record. Guy 
Halferty is cross country and track 
coach, has been responsible for the 
success of the teams on the cin
der track. Mr. Halferty deserves 
credit for his efforts.
The freshmen team also has an 
outstanding record, losing only one 
meet in five. The best time for 
the freshmen was 13:39. Every 
freshman on the team won his 
numerals. The boys who wero 
awarded numerals wore Beamer, 
Dunn, Keenan, McFarlan, McGin
nis, and Valentour.

THE OEniOE TAKTAKTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1941
Campus Chatter
Flo 'Williams is doing O. K. by 
herself since shes working in the R.
O. T. C. officethe only drawback 
shes forgotten how to walk and 
continually breaks into a march 
but, nevertheless, were right proud 
of you, gal . . .
We promised a certain architect 
that wed use his name in this col
umn  so here tis, H-e-r-m-a-n 
E-l-l-i-n-g . . .
Flash! Bashful Don VanEske has 
turned into a man about town 
he came to the last dance. Alright, 
so he was stag, but give him 
time . . .
Could it be that Walter Renberg 
doesnt think so much of his ladyf airs dramatic ability, or could it 
be that hes broke. Rumor has it 
that after four nights of her star
ring in New England Picnic 
they went to see that play on her 
night off . . . In case you see 
someone in the hall with two black 
eyes, or donning crutchesdont be 
frightened, its probably Old Tim
er after the Architects catch up 
with him. Believe us, it wasnt Jr. 
Pettigrewthat hole in his face is 
the; after effects of his date with his 
vicious gal friend . . .
Prizes for the "reddest nose of 
the week goes to June Davidson 
we commend her loyalty to the 
Plaid in showing-up on Friday 
such a cold. Tch! Tch! (P. S. I think 
shes trying to poison us with those 
so-called cough drops.) . . .
Has anyone seen Jim Millers 
new tie (as if you could miss it). 
So bright (and how!) and cheery 
sort of a square sun setting in a 
field of green bowling balls . . .

Holiday Ball
Dance Tempo Set 
By Lee Barrett
Evening Student Councils annual 
Thanksgiving dance was held last 
Saturday night in the Gymnasium 
and, as is usual for a Holiday dance, 
was well attended. The music, fur
nished in the inimitable style of 
Lee Barrett was really smooth, and 
his arrangements individual. Le* 
Barrett is no newcomer to Pitts
burgh. He has played at many of 
the night spots in the vicinity, and 
his band is well liked by all who 
have had the pleasure of dancing to 
his music.
The affair was semi-formal, and 
the young ladies in attendance were 
quite in accord with the suggestion 
of long dresses* judging from the 
number in evidence.
The decorations were in keeping 
with the Holiday spirit as were al
so the programs distributed to the 
first, two/ hundred ladies present. 
Corsages also, were given out to the 
young ladies.
The black cat room was its usual 
busy self, and cokes and other 
soft drinks flowed freely during 
the course of the evening for those 
interested in refreshments. The 
black cat. room is located in the 
basement of the Gym building, and 
was put there for the express pur
pose of providing a place for re
freshment and the congregation of 
groups and couples during inter
missionand for that matter, dur
ing the course of the entire even
ing;
Evening School needs more co
operation of the sort that was ex
pressed on the occasion of this 
dance. It is this cooperation, that 
is responsible for the success of 
these affairs, and, it is up to the 
students to keep^ up the good work 
that will continue to make these af
fairs successes.
Student Council deserves an ex
pression of thanks for their efforts 
towards making this dance com
plete in every way, and: thanks are 
expressed to Lou Fosner and his 
Social Committee for their good 
work on the affair.
