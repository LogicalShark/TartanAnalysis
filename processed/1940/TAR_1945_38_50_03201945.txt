Unbeaten Delts & Rex 
Clash for First Place; 
Beta Team Eliminated
Mondays battle of the undefeated 
in the intramural, league saw the 
Delt team drop the Betas by 34-22, 
and continue to neck-and-neck it 
with the Rex. That same night the 
hot Rex team trampled the Theta 
Xis 35-20, but temmporarily lost the 
services of Walt Mruk through an 
injury to his eye. Reinforced Cam
eron Hall, meanwhile, pulled an up
set by dropping DU in a terrific 
game 24-23. This apparent improve
ment in the dorm mens team gives 
them the edge in the battle with 
Theta Taus cellar occupants next 
week, and may get them more than 
one victory yet.
On Wednesday, for instance, the 
pretty fair TX team had quite a bat
tle to stop Cameron by 27-24. We 
hereby move Cameron Hall up to 
the status of a team to worry about.
The Rex, though, didnt have as 
much to worry about, and took it 
easy in beating Theta Tau 60-19. 
Trefery took Mruks place and took 
home 38 points.
The real battle of the season will 
be that waged tomorrow evening, 
when the Rex battle the Delts in 
the mens gym. The Delts will de
pend on their regular tall starters, 
and the Rex will have the services 
of the patched Mruk to counter 
Halls pitching. It will certainly be 
a show to see, and a respectable 
crowd is expected.
Honorary Sponsors 
Driv for Scholarship
The Carnegie chapter of Phi Kap
pa Phi has just begun its campaign 
to raise $10,000 for the Endowment 
Fund of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology to establish scholarship 
awards in memory of the late Di
rector R. M. Ihrig and the late Pro
fessor L. T. Lawler, past presidents 
of the Chapter. These two men gave 
unstintingly of their time and ener
gies for the advancement of students 
at Carnegie Tech. The Chapter, in 
establishing the fund, hopes to carry 
forward the work they did as well.
The income from the gift will be 
used for three awards made for the 
senior year, one in the College of 
Fine Arts, one in the College of En
gineering, and one in Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie College. The awards 
will be made to those students 
showing greatest promise of attain
ing the ideals of Phi Kappa Phi in 
scholarship and character and will 
be known as the Roscoe M. Ihrig

Tecvets Sponsor 
Dance Sat. Night
The dance which promises to be 
the outstanding event of the cur
rent semester is shaping up to be a 
really big affair. The Tecvet Easter 
Parade, sponsored by the Tecvets, 
will feature the orchestra of Billy 
LeRoy. Since this is the first orches
tra dance of the semester, it is ex
pected that the event will be sup
ported by every student.
The Tecvet Easter Parade will be 
held in Thistle Hall on the evening 
of Saturday, March 24, rom eight 
to twelve. Tickets, which can be ob
tained from any Tecvet or at the 
door, are priced at $2.00 per couple, 
tax included.
The Tecvets, a relatively new or
ganization on campus composed of 
veterans, have been working hard 
to make this dance a success, to 
show that it is possible, even in 
these times to have big all-school 
dances. The fellows who are man
aging this affair are: Mike Glass, 
social chairman; Joe Nutter, tickets; 
Paul Secher, publicity; Bill McKelvry, decoration; and Ed Smuts, 
refreshments.
In addition to the smooth rhythms 
of Billy LeRoy, the Tecvets are 
planning to have plenty of refresh
ments. Plans are also being made 
to have Thistle Hall decorated in the 
gayest of Easter colors.
The Tecvets are putting a lot of 
work into this dance, in the effort to 
make it the first of what is hoped 
to be a series of annual dances. Lets 
all turn out and join the Easter 
Parade March 24.
Womens Guild Holds 
Dessert Bridge Sat.
This Saturday, March 24, from 
2:30 to 5:30 the Womens Guild will 
have a Mother-Daughter Dessert 
Bridge in Thistle Hall. The bridge 
will provide an opportunity for 
mothers to become acquainted with 
each other. There will be two door 
prizes given. The Guild Dessert 
Bridge will replace their annual 
dance. The receipts from the tickets, 
which cost 50c, will be used to build 
up the scholarship fund for this 
year. One of the highlights of the 
afternoon will be a bake sale; the 
Guild would appreciate any contri
butions for the sale. Because the 
Guild is solely a philanthropic or
ganization to raise money for schol
arships, you will want to give it 
your full support.

TRE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 20, 1045
Zdctani AntncUcUn.
How a Flop Is Made
The unpleasant job of kicking about the Activities Council now appears 
to be our prime function in life. Were off on a gripe again.
You have probably just read the story on page 7 concerning the dance 
of last Friday night. If you were there you know it, and if you merely read 
the story you guessed it. It was what is known as a flop. The reasons for it 
being so termed are many.
The most important factor in the success of any dance is the number 
of people in attendance. The number at this dance was roughly sixty or 
seventy. This deficiency can be explained by the fact that no posters for 
the dance were put up until almost the very day of the affair. We saw one 
sign on the Cut bulletin board on Thursday and another being put up in the 
Canteen at noon on Friday. True, there was a story in the Tartan, but too 
many people forget what they may read and must be reminded by many 
and often posters. Or maybe Activities Council doesnt know its constitu
ents very well? In a word, the publicity for the dance was handled very 
badly.
Another sad factor of the dance was the late cancellation of the elec
tion campaign speeches. We have not yet been able to ascertain the reason 
for this move, but the persistent rumor maintains that it was because the 
master of ceremonies backed out. His explanation, we understand, was that 
there wouldnt be enough people at the dance and that not enough candi
dates were going to speak anyway. We have just explained why there 
werent many people at the dance. And we think we know why few candi
dates were going to give their speeches.
Firstly, they also realized that there wouldnt be enough people present 
to be worth their while. Secondly, they had not been properly contacted. 
They were not told when they were to speak, how long they would have, 
and what they were specifically to say. Some, but few, had been called 
before Thursday night. Thirdly, they realized the lack of effect of a formal 
speech, and would probably have been more apt to cooperate in an informal 
campaign rally. And so for these reasons, they decided not to speak at 
the dance. '
Although the dance was scheduled to begin at 8:30, nine oclock found 
the doors locked and the record machine, the refreshments, and some early 
birds waiting around.
Inefficiency and irresponsibility, we call it.
Oh, yes, there was one good thing. The cokes did arrive this time.
It s Spring on The Campus
Yes, its spring on the campus and theres lots should be done. For 
example, how about some park benches so that we wont have to sit on the 
wet lawns? And how about some out-door waste containers so that the 
streets and walks dont become littered? And how about some classes being 
held outside? And how about coke fountains here and there? And how 
about turning off the steam in the buildings? And how about not censuring 
a students spring fever expression? And how about being lenient with a 
decline in home-study results? And how about some outdoor concerts? 
And how about a SPRING VACATION?
We can dream, cant we? . *

For the first time this season, the 
Drama Department is presenting a 
classic which was not originally 
written in the English language. 
Such a project is always difficult, 
but in this weeks production of The 
Miser they have made a highly suc
cessful job of it. This production dif
fers in another way from the rest of 
the seasons work: instead of being 
directed by a regular member of 
the faculty it is in the hands of one 
of the students, Marquis Patterson, 
familiar to all Little Theater audi
ences, who is submitting it as a par
tial fulfillment of the requirements 
for the degree of Master of Fine 
Arts in Drama. We are not making 
any allowance for this circumstance 
in our criticism, for we feel that the 
excellent quality of the show de
mands its being judged on the same 
basis as all the other productions 
we have reviewed.
Mr. Patterson used his own trans
lation of The Miser.
Usually a translation misses par
tially or completely the flavor of 
the original; we are not qualified to 
judge this since our knowledge of 
French is rather limitedhowever, 
we have read other translations of 
Molieres comedy, and consider Mr. 
Pattersons almost perfect in com
parison. The dialogue is up-to-date 
and skillful, without that awkward
ness to be found in most transla
tions. In other words, the present 
production takes its first hurdle 
easily and gracefully.
As for the play itself, at first it 
reminded us vaguely of The Way of 
the World, but this impression did 
not remain with us long. The Miser 
is not superficial a play; it has more 
richness, more variety; it has three 
dimensions, whereas Congreves 
play seems to have only two. The lat
ter is hard and polished and shiny, 
but the former is warm and human. 
In a few places the actors did not 
seem to remember this distinction 
very clearly, but for the most part 
they got it across beautifully. Most 
of the comedy in the show is of our 
favorite typethe audience knows 
something that somebody on the 
stage doesnt know, which gives the 
dialogue delicious double-meanings. 
Because of this quality we had al
ways thought of Moliere as a very 
subtle dramatist; while Mr. Patter
son gives us the subtlety for all it
is worth, he also introduces some 
touches of boisterous, slapstick 
humor. This wouldnt hurt if done 
carefullymost of the time it was 
handled well, but in several spots 
it was decidedly overdone. The 
scenes with the two lackeys were 
the worst examples of this. In a 
way such rowdiness was almost nec
essary, however, for The Miser is 
rather a talky play without too 
much action taking place on the 
stage.
The acting was on the whole 
very competent. Jack Hochhauser, 
in the title role, was much better 
than in any other part we have seen 
him attempt. His long scene at the 
end of the second act had moments 
that were positively superb; unfor
tunately his usual hammy style 
crept in once in a while and marred 
the effect. We forgive him every
thing except his intonation of the 
tag line of the act. That was really 
too bad. Taking the order of im
portance not to the plot, but to the 
show, we come next to Lucy Seibert 
as La Fleche. This is her first really 
big part in any of the major pro
ductions, and in it she definitely 
proves her worth. Her pertness and 
complete naturalness (as well as a 
strong resehblance to Shirley Tem
ple as a little girl) won the hearts 
of the audience on her first entrance, 
and kept them until the very end. 
Gerry Jedds Master Jacques was 
another memorable performance. 
There was not quite so much orig
inality in her characterization as in 
Miss Seiberts, but none the less she 
did a very good job in a swell part.
In the juvenile roles, Sue Crobaugh and Ray Boyle proceeded 
calmly and convincingly. Parker 
Meyers showed a vast improvement 
since Th Old Maid; except for a 
slight lack of sincerity, he was quite 
satisfactory. Patricia Walker seem
ed to be a little sleepy Saturday 
night, she wasnt bad, but she didnt 
play with her usual skill. Theo Dunkelman, with a simply fascinating 
coiffure, played a professional 
matchmaker. We found the hairdo 
a little too fascinating  made it 
rather hard to follow the dialogue 
but her acting was assured and cap
able. The minor roles all left some
thing to be desired, but they did not 
spoil the effect of the play to a great 
extent.

hold a dance on March 24, 1945, in Thistle 
Hall from 8:00 to 12:00 p.m.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
One of the Dogs
Introducing Panda, SAEs nom
ination for Dog of the Year. Ruler 
of the Roost at the SAE house, 
glamour gal Panda is fully forty 
pounds of solid Eskimo spitz and po
lice, complete with dreamy brown
eyes, pearl white teeth, and soft 
white fur dotted here and there by 
patches of black.
This canine queen joined SAEs 
ranks over four years ago when only 
a pup of three months. With only a 
couple of winks now and then she 
has established herself as SAEs 
leading lady and is as much a part 
of fraternity life as the nightly bull 
session.
The derivation of her principal 
handle is obvious from one quick 
glance at the pic, although the re
semblance was much greater in 
puppyhood. She has also been dub
bed as Susie and affectionately as 
Pooch.
Quite well known and widely lik
ed on the campus, Panda somehow
. . . Panda
manages to be among friends and 
satisfy her canine desires without 
visiting freshman Soc Rel classes 
and chemistry labs. Susies usual 
greeting to a newcomer is a sharp 
woof, but shes quick to accept 
new friends.
Panda, although pretty particular 
about her likes and dislikes, gets 
along well with just about every
thing and everybody, if given a lit
tle time. She is particularly fond of 
certain people (SAEs in particu
lar), dog biscuits, car riding, candy, 
raw dough, and walking. In fact, she 
so enjoys her little jogs around the 
campus and surrounding territory 
that she wont leave anybody in 
peace after they breathe the word 
walk in her presence. Nothing 
makes the hair on her neck bristle 
so much as rats, cats, garbage men, 
and her regular (oh quite regular) 
baths in Ivory Flakes.
Oh, those baths, Panda thinks 
without them I could lead the life 
of a truly happy dog. Canine com
plaints or no complaints, the soaping 
comes and goes with inescapable 
frequency and with the accom
panying red eyes and little sneezes. 
The one big thing thoughfluffy 
white instead of dull gray.
Her mastery of the tricks of re
trieving, shaking hands, begging, 
sitting-up, rolling over, and answer
ing roll call rank her with the best 
in doglands Phi Beta Kappa. She 
seems to know quite instinctively 
when someone is talking to her, and 
her reaction is to perk up her ears 
and turn her head. For the words 
walk and see she will also jump 
to her feet and set her tail wagging.
Not content to lie around asleep 
all the time, Panda keeps one eye 
open and is constantly on the alert 
for intruders. No one can get away

with much when Susies on guard. 
Many Delts and others hav . . . 
Well, anyway, Panda has a pretty 
sharp collection of molars, in some 
pretty strong jaws.
Panda follows every wish of Aunt 
Helen (her mistress and the SAE 
house mother, Miss Helen Rippen). 
Susie simply adores Aunt Helen and 
is really in the dog house when 
they are separated.
The soundest menu for earning 
Pandas affection is to take her 
strolling (the more the better), feed 
her little tidbits of delicacies, throw 
a ball or stick for her to chase and 
return, and just pay a little atten
tion to her now and then by play
ing around.

TRACKING DOWN 
. . TROUBLE
This laboratory, ready to move anywhere on short 
notice, runs down crimes against good tele
phone service. Finding these threats is one of the 
many jobs of the Bell Telephone Laboratories 
scientists.
The criminals are such things as threads of 
lint, traces of acids, or sulphur compounds in the 
airany of which might damage telephone equip
ment.
In their interesting war work Bell Laboratories 
scientists have been on a new kind of hunt. They 
have tracked down different materials for those 
now hard to get, found others that would serve in 
special conditions, and have detected in captured 
equipment the kinds of material the enemy uses.
These are some examples among many of the 
ways Bell System research is helping to serve 
America at war.

Mrs. Charles Watkins, Chairman 
of Relief Work for the Women's 
Club of Carnegie Tech, has received 
the following letter from Mrs. Claton A. Gill, Chairman of the Queen 
Wilhelmina Guild:
Words fail to express the deep 
appreciation on the part of the 
Queen Wilhelmina Guild for the 
beautiful knit sweaters, afghans, 
and baby garments which Miss 
Hartwell was so kind as to deliver 
to my home. Please consider this 
note a hearty thank you to each 
individual who gave so generously 
of her time and effort.
Will you please thank the ladies 
again for the used clothing they 
have donated. These articles have 
helped ustto send out approximately 
twelve hundred articles of clothing 
this month.
I regret very much to inform you 
that, due to the possibility of a flood 
in the Golden Triangle area, the 
Joseph* Horne Company preferred 
not to assume responsibility for the 
display of our garments at this time. 
However, they are on display at the 
Albert J. Mansmann Company.
Thanking you again for the choice 
contribution, I am
Very sincerely yours,

that were in a rut?
(Note: Any discrepancy in fact in the above
column is due to misinterpretation on the part of 
the printer. The error was discovered too close 
to press time to have the column re-set. Ed.)
While roaming the corridors of 
the Art School the other day, we 
came across one of the most inter
esting individuals that we have ever 
met. His name is Hector Elliot Kel
ley III and is enrolled in the Drama
School as a freshman. Hector had 
been studying medicine at Pitt but 
decided that he could broaden his 
outlook by coming to Tech. And we 
certainly are glad that he did change 
his mind about studying medicine.
Questioning Hector, we found 
that he was born in a steamer trunk
 in the middle of the Atlantic 
Oceanwhich isnt at all odd seeing 
that he is a seven and one half foot 
giraffe. He tells us that his mother 
was a hippopotamus and his father 
was a mongoose; thus, he is a giraffe. 
He is interested in stamp collecting, 
eating Spanish Peanuts, and mostly 
women! His favourite movie star 
is Lauren Bacall and Clarabelle Cow 
runs a close second.
As you can easily see by his pic
ture (Photo credit to Danny
Franks), he is the answer to the 
Techs co-eds prayer. As we said be
fore, he is seven and one half feet 
tall, has a lovely spotted complex
ion, and has the most be-you-ti-ful 
wavy hair this side of Victor Ma
ture. He won the All-American title 
as Chief Tiddly-Winker, in the 
spring of 1935 and has many loving 
cups to prove his prowess in other 
indoor games.
He went to the AC dance accom
panied by Jacques Holloway and 
had a thoroughly good time. His 
opinion of Tech women, in a word, 
is  ! (Giraffes
cant talk you know.) He loves mu
sic and tho Guy Lombardo may 
play the sweetest music this side 
of heaven, Hector plays the hottest 
music this side of hell.
Hectors first day at Tech was 
very enjoyable. He was escorted to 
his classes by Ruth Guberman and 
Casey Stine and the comments that 
the teachers made were indeed in
teresting. Mrs. Edith Skinner 
(Voice and Speech) said that his 
sibilants were the best that she had 
ever heard and she loved his final 
consonants. Miss Mary Morris is 
considering putting Hector in Ca
mille, when it will be presented 
here next year. Hector will natural
ly play Camille.
Hector is only displeased with one 
thing and that is merely that he 
doesnt like Pittsburgh. He cannot 
stand the terrific heat. He says that 
the jungles of Africa are heaven 
compared with this. He loves the 
people here tho and is looking for
ward to spending many days here 
drinking in the atmosphere of cul
ture that the Art School gives out 
with. Best of luck, Hector Elliot Kel
ley III!!!!
Spring On The Campus
Ah yes, its spring on the campus 
once more and The Old Grind has 
been cast out of the window. This 
colyum is going to dedicate itself 
to spring and try to prove that its 
really here (even if we do have an 
eleven foot snow the day the Tartan 
comes out.) If you were around the 
old familiar places last week, you 
noticed:
. . . The great George Unbeliev
able Factor Pake really being hit 
by Spring Fever.
. . . The after-effects of the beer 
party held by certain engineers in 
a certain building within' easy 
throwing distance of a certain 
railroad.
. . . Some dramats playing May I 
outside of the canteen. Ah youth!
. . . Scotty Atkinson and Duke 
Bolton out on a big date. Duke came 
in singing A Ramblin Wreck from 
C. I. Tech ...
. . . Alice Skirpan being escorted 
everywhere by Aubrey Caplan. Iris 
Hilton isnt enjoying spring like she 
should.
. . . Ruth Guberman, George Baur, 
and Wendell Minor knocking them
selves out at the swimming party.
. . . The Rrruff girls of the week: 
Jackie Alexander, Ginger Hall, 
Maryellen Schmitt, and La Vetta 
Hammond.
. . . Prissy Dodge running ahead of 
schedule and appearing in green 
shorts! (Note: Bob Casey will be 
home from the Navy in five weeks!)
. . . Milton Levine being home and 
Glo Goldsmith absolutely beaming!
. . . The dramatic scene at the AC 
dance when the couple draped in 
sheets marched in chanting Crobaugh and Casey for AC!
. . . How beat all the pledges of all 
the fraternities look.
. . . Everyone wishing we were go
ing to have a Spring Carnival.
. . . Sally Rosenberg buying a beyou-ti-ful Tau Delt ring for Eph 
Abramson.
. . . Eddie Stephens and Len Lerman deciding to go out and get 
really plastered when they gradu
ate, in April. That wed have to see!
. . . How everyone is talking about 
the new play, The Miser, at the 
Little Theatre, and how wonderful 
it is! What about more plays direct
ed by Marquis Patterson?
. . . Freshman engineer-ess, Bobby 
Jones seen every place where the 
elite meet.
. . . Paul Schucker blazing new 
trails in Schenley Park with a P. C. 
W. stude.
. . . Jerry Staffney getting inspira
tion in Engineering Drawing (thats 
what they told us!) over at Audrey 
Hobes desk.
. . I Fred (He had to go to Charles 
Atlas for six months to get up 
enough strength to hic-cough!) 
Mitchell being completely sent by
Josie.
. . . Don Poskin looking more like 
Errol Flynn than ever. A definite 
case of Spring Fever!
. , . For a couple of people whor 
were un-Tau Delt pinned the other 
week  Ben Schwartz and Betty 
Rickman are pretty friendly.
At this point, we developed Spring 
Fever too. Feeling that we must 
break the bonds we dashed out of 
the Tartan office and jumped head-, 
long into Westinghouse Pond  - 
urgle! gurgle! goo!

TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
One of the Girls
Prissy Dodgea member of Kap
pa Alpha Theta, and of Mortar 
Board, a former Cwen, an exponent 
of comedy dance with Scotch and 
Soda until its war-produced death 
is, first of all, a drama student. 
Youve seen her this year as Delia 
in The Old Maid, as the Countess in 
Alls Well That Ends Well, and as 
Lucy Amorest in The Old Ladies. If 
you go to the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
between April 3 and April 21, you 
will see her as Mrs. Crochet in The 
Great Big Doorstep. In May there 
will be a musical comedy at the 
Playhouse. (Rumor: Prissy will be 
in evidence there, then.)
It all began in an attic full of 
costumes  the attic of her house 
where, at the age of five, she produc
ed plays and gave dance recitals for 
the entertainment of the neighbor
hood. But the real impetus toward 
her becoming a dramat occurred 
when she was eight years old. She 
became a member of Genevieve 
Jones dance group, the Pittsburgh 
Orchesis, which toured, presenting 
dances composed by the members of 
the group. Through this creative 
dancing she first experienced the 
thrill of the stage which developed 
into her love of the theatre. After 
graduating from high school, where 
she appeared in all the plays and 
did choregraphic work, she didnt 
hesitate in her decision to study at 
Tech, for she had heard that the 
Drama Department here is the place 
to acquire an all-round knowledge 
of the theatre. And now, Prissy is a 
senior who can look back over four 
years of crew, classes, crew, rehear
sals, crew, parts in innumerable stu
dio and theatre productions and 
everything which is part of the hec
tic life of ah enthusiastic dramat.
That isnt all the activity we see 
in reviewing Prissys last four years. 
There was Spring on the Campus 
and other comedy skits and songand-dances, at Freshman Recep
tions, at Spring Carnivals, and at 
this years Six-for-One benefit, 
There was The Siren oj the Nile, a 
musical written by Ken Welsh, a 
P & D, which Pris directed and in 
which she played Cleopatra. The 
Siren made a hit each time it was 
played, especially at Deshon Hos
pital, where Tech dramats have 
taken many studio productions. 
There were twelve broadcasts at 
KDKA on the Childrens Bookshelf 
program; and that unforgettable 
time last year when Pris toured 
with the Childrens Theatre as the 
White Queen in twelve perform
ances of Alice and Wonderland at 
the same time when she was appear
ing Cry Havoc here at C. I. T.
Summers have favored her with 
some of her most interesting activi
ties and experiences. After her 
freshman year, at the Mountain 
Playhouse near Jennerstown she 
acted in twelve plays and worked 
on crew. Her Ellen Deane in Wuthering Heights was such a triumph 
that she had to play a return en
gagement. When she was cast as an 
Italian woman in .Mr. and Mrs 
North, not having studied dialects, 
she went home one Sunday after
noon with the Italian maid who 
worked at the inn near the Play
house, and from the girls mother
. . . Prissy Dodge
she picked up an Italian accent as 
well as many ideas for the charac
terization of her part.
Pris spent the next summer work
ing at the Pittsburgh Playhouse, ap
pearing in Pennywise, Goodby
Again, Count Your Blessings, and 
several other Playhouse produc
tions. Goodby Again was also pre
sented at Slippery Rock for the Air 
Cadets and at Camp Reynolds. Pris
sy enjoyed Count Your Blessings 
more than any other play in which 
she has acted. It was her first mu
sical comedy and the first time she 
had fully realized the fun of shar
ing with an audience. From that 
time on she has known that musical 
comedy is her favorite sphere in the 
theatre. Shell be very happy if she 
can go through life making people 
smile. (,r3pring on the Campus, 
which Carnegie Tech considers its 
own, was introduced in Count Your 
Blessings.)
Last summer she Went to New 
York City where she worked in 
Franklin Simons College Shop, 
studied advanced modern dance 
with Charles Weidman and Doris 
Humphrey, and, for the National 
Theatre Wing, sold war bonds and 
stamps at New York theatres and 
was a hostess once a week at the 
Stage Door Canteen.
This summer . . . well, first she is 
going to sleep and sleep and not 
wake up for a long time. Then she 
is going to make use of the attic at 
her home where she plans to teach 
dancing, and voice and speech. She 
also expects to do some radio work 
and to take voice and tap dancing 
lessons.
In the fall, it will be New York 
City for Prissy. Among the things 
she wants to do is to entertain for 
the U. S. 0.r to work in television, 
and, of course, to find herself a place 
in musical comedy. Since her eightyear-old days she has hoped to pro
duce a dance drama. And her high
est aspiration is to have a theatre of 
her own some day in which she can 
give actors and playwrights a start.
Prissys loves are steak and a hot 
bath after crew; Noel Cowards 
musial comedies (she used Bitter
sweet for her thesis this year) and 
Martha Grahams modern dance 
technique; Edmund Gwenns acting 
and people who do and say things 
straight from the heart. Her list 
is not complete without Carnegie 
Tech, for whose opportunities and
Period Extended For 
Ideal Girl Sketch
There may be a cigarette short
age, but you wouldnt know it from 
the way the bashful C. I. T. cartoon
ists fall all over themselves to see 
who can be last to turn in a draw
ing of the ideal college girl as she 
was selected in the recent war 
stamp poll. In last weeks Tartan a 
notice appeared to the effect that a 
pack of cigarettes would be given to 
the artist who produced the closest 
approximation to the actual com
posite photography of our ideal, but 
the results were far from satisfac
tory, so the time limit has been ex
tended one week to take care of late 
entrys. At that time the Tartan will 
publish both the composite picture 
and the winning drawing.

Professor Lawler came to Tech in 
1919 and served on the faculty in 
the Social Relations Department 
until his death in 1944. He is remem
bered by the students for his active 
participation in student activities 
as coach of the Debating Team, ad
visor to Technical, Tartan, Citcom 
Clan, and YMCA.
Dr. Ihrig was director of the Divi
sion of General Studies and of the 
evening courses. He had been on the 
faculty here since 1915 serving as 
professor and head of the Depart
ment of Modern Languages, then as 
Director of the Summer Session and 
of night and part-time classes.
Both these men were beloved by 
all their students, by alumni, and by 
members of the faculty. They in
fluenced the lives of thousands of 
their students and exemplified to 
the fullest extent, the sentiment in 
the phrase, My heart is in the 
work.
The Chapter has already contrib
uted $600 to the Endowment Fund. 
This means .that an additional $9,400 
must be raised. Contributions are

to assist in the establishment of this 
memorial fund. Please send your 
contributions to Miss Jeanne Hart

friendships she will always be grate
ful. Techs tribute to Pris is that she 
will always be remembered here not 
only for her acting and her enter
taining but also for her big grin and 
her bigger heart.
Activities Council 
Dance Held Friday
The third in a series of juke box 
dances was staged last Friday night 
in Thistle Hall. It was designed to 
take the place of the larger social 
events of prewar time, and also to 
give the opportunity for candidates 
to give their political speeches. Sup
posedly to start at 8:30, students 
were slow in arriving, and the hall 
wasnt opened until nine.
Dancing occupied most of the time 
but was broken by two electioneer
ing stunts. Stine and Guberman, 
robed in white sheets and carrying 
a staff, squatted in the center of the 
floor and gave a plug for Sue Crobaugh and Casey Stine. Later on, a 
trio composed of Lou Emmel, Ada 
Bucy, and Pasty Irwin, gave forth 
with their campaign song.
The Black Cat was open this time, 
serving refreshments. Apparently 
many were not aware of this, since 
at no time was it too crowded.
One strange sight, at least strange 
during wartime at Carnegie, was 
the preponderance of fellows over 
gals for much of the evening. This 
distressing situation was relieved 
during the later parts of the night.
As all good Tech social events do, 
this dance was also broken up by the 
stroke of midnight.

Forget Red Points 
For Engs Banquet
Here it is another week and an
other article to write. But a fellow 
doesnt mind writing about the En
gineers Thirtieth Annual Banquet 
for new items keep coming in each 
week to make this an easy job. For 
instance the Committee informed 
me that the banquet dinner is going 
to feature chicken and all the trim
mings, and that in itself means a 
good dinner to most any man.
Then the Committee informed me 
that ticket sales are exceptionally 
promising so, fellows, you can ex
pect to see quite a crowd at the ban
quet.
Peg Lanagans Theatrical Studio 
informs us that the entertainment 
end of of the banquet is shaping up 
in fine style and that can be taken 
literally or figuratively.
Your reporter mentioned last 
week that the souvenirs and favors 
were starting to come in and since 
then the Committee has received 
some more beautiful items that can 
be used for prizes and favors.
And fellows, the Committee also 
tells me that by next week they 
should have something definite on 
the speaker and just as soon as your 
reporter gets the dope hell forward 
it to you by way of the Plaid.
If you havent gotten your ticket 
contact any College officer or stop 
at Mr. McKelways office, Room 
225C, Industries Hall.
Swimming Party Called 
Big Splash of the Year
If you werent at the swimming 
party, you missed the time of your 
life. It was really the outstanding 
athletic event of the year sponsored 
by Evening School. It goes without 
saying, that all the water lovers 
were in their glory, because where 
else can you find a pool as nice as 
Techs where the water temperature 
is just right?
For those who were riot as enthu
siastic about swimming as some, 
there was the opportunity to talk 
to old friends and to make new 
friends, because the atmosphere of 
a swimming pool is very informal.
The warm spring weather we 
have had for the past few days must 
have acted as an* incentive as was 
evidenced by the crowd that attend
ed. But there was plenty of room for 
all to enjoy themselves.
There were many expert swim
mers present and the diving board 
was in use most of the evening. Al
so there was a large colored water 
ball being thrown around and mak
ing a general nuisance of itself. 
There was much ducking and water 
splashing to be seen but it was all 
in fun.
Everyone seemed to have a good 
time and it was agreed that the 
party was a refreshing diversion, for 
it is often difficult to go swimming 
during the winter. Many people ask
ed for another party and we agree 
that it would be very nice, if the 
time left on the ichedule permit.
Tra la! Tra la! Spring has come. 
That is how this warm weather has 
affected your reporter, but I will try 
to come down to earth long enough 
to give out with the gossip . . . We 
are happy to report that Fred Vichichs little girl has come home from 
the hospital, which proves that 
pneumonia cant get a good girl

accused of having the proper ap
proach and technique. No further

Why!
The Pro and Con of 
Military Training
At the present time there has de
veloped considerable controversy, 
pro and con, in regard to the ques
tion of military training for the"' 
youth of the country. That the ques
tion is of extreme importance, none 
can deny.
Coming out in opposition to any 
immediate movement for a plan 
which could be put into operation 
were some ten to twelve heads of 
colleges and universities. This group 
counselled against any action at the 
present time and gave as one rea
son the fact that war hysteria might 
influence the decision for such a 
movement. It was held by the group 
that the country should wait until 
the war is over and then make plans, 
if any for military training.
At a more recent meeting of an
other group of college and univer
sity heads, there were fourteen ed
ucators who strongly favored a 
movement for compulsory training. 
Their feeling was so strong on this 
subject that they stressed the point 
that the judgment of the people of 
our nation are now more sound on 
this issue than they will be when 
the war is over and we are at peace 
again.
It is unpredictable what actions 
people will take or what is behind 
these actions. It is also strange that 
some of the colleges and universities 
which fostered the R. 0. T. C. in 
peace time think, now that we are
at war, it is untimely that any 
thought be given to compulsory mil
itary training of the youth of the 
country.
Would these same opponents wait 
until the horse is stolen before 
locking the stable door, or neglect 
to safeguard their property until it 
has been damaged? I think not. 
They would be the first to use all 
available means to protect their per
sonal property. And if they needed 
funds for some university project, 
they would not wait until the need 
was over before laying plans and 
actually conducting a campaign for 
the project. There would be no 
counselling for a delay lest a fear 
hysteria influence peoples atti
tudes toward the campaign project.
The time to strike is now, and 
right now, when the need is urgent 
and all are conscious that the safest 
way to protect ones property is to 
be prepared, tcf be stronger armed 
than ones opponent.
It is inconceivable how anyone 
could argue against taking measures 
which would aid our country in 
safeguarding its place, immeasura
ble so when the opposition comes 
from those who, because of their 
positions, should be the last ones to 
inhibit any such action.
The lack of the very discipline 
which would be instilled in the 
youth of the country through a pro
gram of military training is one of 
the lamentable phases of the im
mediate prewar attitude of the 
youth of college age and its atti
tude toward authority in general. 
Theirs appeared to be a sophisticat
ed, self-sufficient, irresponsible, care
free manner.
In contrast, take a group which 
has received some training, call it 
discipline of a quasi military nature 
if you wish, and you will find that 
there is proper respect and deference 
toward authority. How much more 
so would this be if we had some reg
ular program which would fit into 
the years of the life of a youth be
tween 18 and 21, a transition period 
between his high school graduation 
and entrance into college?
A plan of training is imperative. 
Right now is the time to make the 
decision while the need is present, 
rather than waiting until reaction 
sets in after the war is over when 
we may be lulled into the forget 
the proposition attitude. Much 
clear thinking can be and if done 
under great stress, witness the great 
inventions; the great campaigns of 
a war which have been successful, 
and many other feats.
Two units of the R. O. T. C. were 
operating on the campus of Car
negie Tech since World War I until 
the outbreak of World War II and 
these were a credit to the institution 
in every way. Look at the many suc
cesses our former students have 
achieved and the brilliant services 
they have rendered the country. 
That we should have the return of 
this and more training of a military 
nature at Tech certainly should be 
evident from the past history.
Need we put off action on such an 
important factor in the safety of the 
life of our country at this timeNo, 
a thousand times NO.
