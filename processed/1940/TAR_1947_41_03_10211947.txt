New Vet Organization Likely 
From Investigation By Steiner
Proposed Under 
Changed Policy
There is a place on campus for 
an organization such as Tecvets 
stated John Steiner, sophomore 
metallurgist, in a recent inter
view.
An informal group is getting to
gether and looking into the possi
bilities of rebuilding the organ

and with a changed program, we

complished through Tecvets.
When asked for his explanation 
of the failure of Tecvets ana the 
.attempt now being made to close 
up the organization, he said im, mediately Mismanagement. InI tentional or unintentional, but

\ The new program proposed by 
I Steiner and his group would be a 
sharp deviation from the purposes 
implied by the groups name.[Continued on page 8] j--------------------*---------------------------------
Harry Thor Gives 
Outline of History
Like a meteor, Tecvets flared 
briefly among CITs numerous or
ganizations and then died a linger
ing death. At the peak of its bril
liance it numbered over two hun
dred active members backed by 
a solid bank account; today there 
is only a shell. In the face of sharp 
criticism by John Steiner of Tec
vets past performance, the Tartan 
relates the following account given 
by Harry Thor, sole remaining of
ficer.
Founded in 1945
Tecvets was founded in May 
1945 by Joe Nutter and a group 
of his friends with the object of 
promoting veterans interests on 
the campus. One of its most suc
cessful ventures was in establish
ing the present housing set-up on 
campus; Tecvets established pre
cedence rules for admission to 
married-veteran units and acted as 
a clearing office for housing in
formation. In addition, orientation 
of returning vets was carried out 
by a large staff at registration.
At one time Tecvets was also 
very active socially. Its contribu
tion to the social whirl at CIT con
sisted of two Easter parades, a 
number of small dances at Thistle 
Hall, and several all-school dances. 
It also served to introduce the vets 
to one another.
Reorganization Attempted
After a busy year in 1945, Tec
vets tried to reorganize in the fall 
of 1946. As Harry Thor, social 
chairman, was the only officer re
maining on campus, he assumed 
responsibility for getting the ball 
rolling. One hundred men ap
peared at the first meeting, and a 
dinner was arranged at which 
Mayor Lawrence was to speak. A 
paltry thirty-five showed up.
Indifference plagued Tecvets 
throughout the year. In fact it was 
not even possible to summon a

Five Organization 
Budgets Approved
Interhonorary Council was 
dissolved on a tabled motion re
opened by Jack Seward as Stu
dent Council held its first fall 
meeting in the Carnegie Union 
at 4:50 p. m. on October 13.
After a .prolonged debate, the 
Council agreed to pay that part 
of the class activity honoraries 
initiation fees in excess of $15. 
The sum estimated as needed 
for this appropriation was $200 
which the budget chairman callChest Drive Will Open Oct. 27; 
Support Asked To Gain $6500
Asking the renewed support of 
CIT, the Community Chest will 
conduct its annual drive for funds 
from October 27 until November 3.
Under the leadership of Dr. 
Norman H. Dawes, who is con
ducting the drive this year in the 
absence of Professor Kent Schaf
fer, the chest is asking Carnegie 
for $6500. This sum is last years 
quota at this years prices.
Student speakers will deliver 
ten minute talks in every class
room, with upperclassmen giving 
the speeches to the freshmen. All 
employees of the Institute, in

Snoyer, Scimitars, Cwens Attempt 
To Restore King Of Hearts Ball
Protesting the omission of the King of Hearts Ball from 
the years social calendar Ernie Snoyer, aided by the Cwens 
and Scimitars, is asking that the affair be scheduled for March 
6 in place of the presently planned Soph Hop.
Snoyer gave as his chief reason for this drive the tremen
dous excitement which the campaign aroused during the last 
>wo years. ^
It was the biggest and most 
enjoyable thing on this campus in 
a long time, he stated.
Propaganda machines were 
busy turning out dozens of glam
orous posters, presenting continu
ous entertainment in Skibo and 
around the campus to the student 
body, and were even currying fa
vor. among the girls by distribut
ing flowers, ice cream, and candy.
If this campaign is  returned 
to the campus, finished Snoyer 
excitedly, it will really provide 
some more of that boost which 
people are now trying to give to 
school spirit.
The Cwens and Scimitars, soph
omore womens and mens honorarieif, have already indicated to 
Student Council that they are will
ing to drop their Soph Hop and
take the responsibility for spon
soring and arranging the King of 
Hearts Ball and campaign.
They have proposed, however, 
that two major changes be made 
in theiri the administration of the 
event. Voting would be restricted 
to women students so that a true 
feminine choice of King would be 
made, and campaign expenses 
would be limited to fifty dollars.
The latter requirement is sug
gested as a means of holding 
down some of the larger cam
paigns to financially reasonable 
proportions.
In order for Student Council 
to grant permission for the return 
of this event, the student body 
must indicate that it wishes this 
action .taken. Petitions will there
fore be posted on each of th main

bulletin boards for the signatures 
of interested students.
Last years campaign was won 
by Bill Tilkey, a Man of Disinction, after a Cecil B. DeMiUe cam
paign of posters and noise.
non-teaching staff, and office and 
maintainance personnel will be 
solicited.
When asked about the forth
coming campaign, Dr. Robert E. 
Doherty stated that contributing 
to the Community Chest is a part 
of our education in good citizen
ship and in the awareness of civic 
problems.
Dr. Dawes, in amplifying this 
statement, pointed out that the 
Chest is truly a full-scale and well 
developed attempt to solve some 
of the pressing problems of the 
community in the most efficient 
manner possible.
The Community Chest is at
tempting to collect $4,947,000 to 
fill the needs of 92 different agen
cies serving 1,500,000 people Costs 
have risen sharply, and to meet 
even this closely calculated figure, 
maximum giving will be required.

Ail Error of Omission
The failure of Student Council to obtain a 
quorum for its first meeting has disappointed 
us very much after the legislative showing 
of those who did attend.
Council, the representative governing body 
of CIT, is composed of 35 voting and four 
non-voting members. But when the first meet
ing was held last Monday, but 22 voting and 
two non-voting members appeared.
As a result of this failure, a' quorum was 
not obtained, and the several important pieces 
of business transacted during the meeting can 
theoretically be rejected or at least upset at 
the meeting this Thursday night.
We know from past experience that this 
will not happen, and that the absentees of 
the previous week will sit dumbly by while 
the business of the new meeting is conducted, 
voting by guess or by friendship rather than 
by the logical results of intelligent thought.
Dropping these people would probably im
prove the efficiency of the entire organization 
considerably, and we are therefore awaiting 
the fourth or fifth meeting of Council, by which 
time at least one person should have accumu
lated the three absences required for dis
missal.
When this has happened, the Tartan will 
be watching president Marshall, awaiting his 
request for a resignation as required by the 
Student Council constitution.
If Mr. Marshall finds himself unable to do 
this, then the Tartan will act, in print, 
as a substitute for him.
Judging from Mr. Marshalls actions so 
far, we do not think that this action will be
come necessary. But if it does, then we will 
oblige.
The Editorial We
The editorial we of the Tartan has in 
the past served as a journalists mask for an 
individual personality, with the column itself 
still being written by the editor unless a new 
signature informed the reader to the contrary.
In order to make the editorials more a part 
of the newspaper and at the same time a wider 
commentary upon campus life, this column will 
now be unsigned, and normally the work of 
three people.
Anthony Arrott, one of our collaborators, 
is the Tartans associate editor, and a wellknown campus leader. An athlete and an honor 
student with wide experience in activities, he 
will bring a new viewpoint to this column.
The third of this composite we is Robert 
W. Johnson, the present copy editor, of the 
Tartan and formerly co-author of Sounding 
Board, a column which explored campus life 
for a number of issues with a fine critical 
spirit.
If Such There Be
Last weeks action by Student Council in 
dissolving Inter-Honorary Council might well 
sound a warning for any student activities 
which find themselves indecisive about their 
purpose.
The time has come for every organization 
to shake loose the cobwebs left by the years 
of wartime inactivity and re-assert its import
ance by proving the worth of its contributions 
to the collegiate scene.
We certainly hope that Student Council will 
not be forced to drop its axe on any more 
necks. Is your house in order?
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
Argentina is a nation that is selling its soul 
for a loaf of bread. And the baker, a filibustering 
revolutionary name of Peron, is acquiring many 
friends through the deal, including the friendship 
of the United States Department of State.
In a country whose government is usually as 
unstable as the isotopes of plutonium, Peron has 
established a popular dictatorship which can get 
65% of the votes at a free election. Attired in 
several pecks of gold braid and a colonels cap, 
President Peron struts about with all the pomp 
and fanfare of a Mussolini. Mussolini had to pay 
the black-shirts who formed his cheering section at 
the Palazio Venezzia, while Peron gets his bobbysox 
fan mail gratis. There are millions of people in Ar
gentina who look on Peron with about ten times 
the adulation the late President Roosevelt got from 
some parts of the U. S. public in his balmiest days. 
And all this in spite of the fact that Argentine 
prisons are full to the rafters.
What has Peron got that Mussolini, Napoleon 
and Caesar didnt have?
Just this. Peron is putting into effect a policy 
of soak the rich and help the poor; at least he is 
soaking the rich. He advertises himself as the 
. working mans frienda fellow to the shirtless 
ones is his way of phrasing it. Moreover, it is 
not all talk. The government has in the course 
of two years taken strict control of the banks, the 
railways, telephones, exports and imports, with 
nationalization of industry occurring on such a 
scale that if it were happening any place but in 
South America it would bring ominous rumblings 
from heavy-jowled coupon clippers the world over.
For all this, the working people, of whom Ar
gentina has plenty, are willing to risk their lives 
for their beloved Juan Peron. Even if their ma
terial benefits have been slight, their morale has 
been raised tremendously. Because, what raises a 
mans spirit more, be he an illiterate ditchdigger or 
a Ph. D., than to see his erstwhile proud bosses 
getting it in the neck? Peron is highly skilled at 
applying it in the neck you see.
It is very debatable (and to this columnist per
sonally it is beyond debate) whether inch-thick 
steaks and red wine for the working people are 
worth the loss of liberty that it has bought them. Is 
a life in which one must shout himself hoarse in 
praise of the saintly virtues of a grandiloquent 
gangster worth living? La Prensa, the world famous 
Buenos Aires newspaper which has always cham
pioned liberal sentiment, is being strangled eco
nomically for failure to support Peron.
The pattern of a new type of fascism is being 
molded in Argentina todaya very successful type 
of fascism because it appeals to the illiterate and 
oppressed Argentinian laboring classes. Yet the 
United States whose principles are antipodes apart 
from those of Prons vest-pocket state, is adding 
to the stability of the Argentinian regime. We are 
showing diplomatic and economic friendship to a 
nation in the streets of whose capital the name of 
th United States is hooted. The State department 
has reshuffled its South American section by dis
missing men like Spruille Braden, long-time critic 
of the Peron regime, from their positions. Peron 
and company who gave Nazi agents all conceivable 
help during the war, are riding high in South Amer
ican prestige on the backs of President Truman 
and the State department.
Letter to the Editor
Cheerleading Complaints
Editor, the Tartan:
The cheer-leading situation at Carnegie Tech 
has become very aromatic in a dead sort of way. 
Something must be done to correct the situation 
before the attempt at revival of school spirit meets 
a premature death.
I feel quite certain that anyone who has had the 
opportunity to observe the functioning of our 
present crop of manikins must certainly leave the 
exhibition with a bad taste in his mouth. It seems 
that our cheer-leaders have lost sight of the fact 
that their duties are to lead cheers, not to make 
amateurish attempts at individual hammy vaude
ville demonstrations.
It appears to this writer that what is needed 
is a complete overhaul of this activity. We need 
new people to take over the job; people who have 
ability along these lines, not people who have frus
trated desires to be actors. I would like to sug
gest that the whole problem be given to Student 
Council and a committee set up by that body to 
choose, from an open competition, members of 
the student body capable of performing the duties 
of cheer-leaders.
Maybe then we can get back to the task at 
handthe task of building up school spirit to. the 
point where it will be a perceptible force on campus.

Mathematically Impossible9 ButState of CIT9 Suggested As 
Carnegie Day T opie By SCC
The state of Carnegie Techits 
progress and difficulties during the 
past year and its plans for the fu
turewill be the subject of Dr. 
Dohertys November 25 Carnegie 
Day address, as suggested by the 
Student Conference Committee.
Meeting at dinner in the special 
faculty dining room off Eftubo at 
6:00 p. m. Thursday, October 16, 
the group of student activities 
leaders selected by the president 
as an informal committee for liason between the student body anc^ 
the faculty and administration on 
any subject of mutual interest 
also discussed several other prob
lems which were raised during the 
meeting.
Many Subjects Discussed
Attendance at assembly hour 
and the possible future of this ac
tivity, a suggested senior seminar 
hour in which graduating students 
would air their suggestions on 
improvement of their department
al curricular and teaching meth
ods, and a compliment to the pres
ident for taking action on a past 
SCC suggestion that the Dean of 
Men be supplied with an adequate 
office were the other topics of 
conversation for the evening.
Make a report to the students, 
said Kenneth Hall, president of 
Citcom Clan, during the discussion 
of a topic for the presidents 
speech for the coming Carnegie 
Day celebration. Tell about school 
policy and explain it to the stu
dent body, and let us know about 
the changes which are being made 
in it.
Carnegie Day Discussed
The problem had been raised by 
Dr. Doherty concerning the ad
visability of continuing the cus
tom of a speech delivered by him 
at these annual exercises.
Carnegie Day said president 
Doherty, was suggested as a time 
suitable for a speech by the pres
ident. The students were complain
ing that they didnt see me during
the year, and that this exercise 
would be a suitable time at which 
to remedy the omission.
This occasion has also been 
used for Call Day. Great emphasis 
was in fact put upon the entire 
occasion, and it was devoted pri
marily to that which deals with 
CIT.
The questions which I am 
raising are: should the president 
speak to the students then, at some 
other time during the year, or at 
all? And if the students want to 
hear me, what type of speech 
would be most interesting to 
them.
Halls answer to Dr. Dohertys 
questions was well received.
Dr. Miner Suggests
Dr. Miner, who along with Stan
ley Marsh of public relations was 
attending as a guest of the com
mittee, suggested that such topics 
as the progress on the synchro
cyclotron be included.
Marsh agreedthe students want 
to hear about CITas did Robert 
Siegel, Technical editor, who 
wanted to hear fewer talks about 
ideas such as are heard in most 
of the assemblies.
When Dr. Miner, attempting to 
define the exact areas of the 
speech, asked if the ' students 
wanted to hear about new 
buildings, housing plans, . and 
developments, or about the future 
educational plans. The committee 
indicated interest in both.
Perhaps the students could ask 
questions of you after your speech, 
Dr. Doherty, Kenneth Hall sug
gested.
Dr. Doherty looked at Mr. Hall, 
and replied as follows, with a 
straight face, I dont think that I 
could hear that well.
Questions Requested
After the general laughter had 
died down, the president suggest
ed that if the students were to 
submit written questions and

Traditions Exam 
Date Announced
The annual traditions exams 
will be given to all Fine Arts and 
Margaret Morrison freshmen on 
Thursday, October 23, and to the 
engineers on Friday, October 24, 
in Room 104 IH at 4f30 p. m.
In order that the freshmen will 
have some idea of what they are 
expected to know, here is a par
tial list of the things they will be 
expected to know: the three fight 
songs, the first verse of the Alma 
Mater, the school cheers, the 
names of the fraternities and so
rorities on campus, the names of 
the honoraries, the names of the 
directors of the three colleges, the 
names of the various deans, and 
the locations of buildings and 
other points of importance on 
campus. All of this information 
may be found in the Student 
handbook.
Scimitar and Cwens, who are in 
charge of the organization of 
freshmen regulations, warn that 
failure to either take or pass the 
exam will result in the barring 
of the offending freshmen from 
all extracurricular activities in
cluding intramural sports.
at Whitfield hall on Sunday, Octo
ber 19. The actives, dressed in 
white, presented a lovely candle
light sing. The informal Straw Hat 
party was held on Friday, October 
17, at the one hundred year old 
bam of Madeline Blackadore, an 
alumna from Westminster. The 
melodrama, East Lynn was pre
sented.
The Tri-Delts held their Star
dust tea at the Carnegie Union on 
Sunday, October 12. The sorority 
emblems and colors were repre
sented in the silver and gold star 
nametags tied with blue ribbons 
and the pine and crescent moon 
consisted of a sorority legend and 
song, followed by group singing. 
On Saturday, October 18, the in
formal Alice in Deltaland party 
was held at the Aspinwall Wom
ens Club House. Both the skit 
and the invitations carried out 
this unique theme.
Boston Tea Party
Delta Gamma held its formal 
Boston Tea Party on Sunday aft
ernoon, October 19, at the Car
negie Union. The centerpiece, ap
propriately enough, was a ship. 
The informal party will be held on 
Friday, October 24, at the Kappa 
Sigma fraternity house.
Kappa Alpha Theta held its for
mal dessert in Whitfield hall on 
Sunday, October 19. The rushees 
and their mothers were entertain
ed with singing. On Saturday eve
ning, October 25, the traditional 
smorgasbord party will be held 
in Fox Chapel at the home of Mrs. 
Caneer, an alumna from the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh.
Informal Party
Kappa Kappa Gamma held its 
informal party on Friday, October 
10, at the home of Gerry Sunseri. 
The rushees were entertained with 
skits and singing, followed by 
bridge. The tea will be held in the 
Carnegie Union on Sunday, Octo
ber 26.
Sigma Kappa held its Devils 
Ball in Wexford, Pa., at the home 
of Mrs. Morrison, an alumna. The 
skit and songs were quite devilish, 
but the surprise of the evening 
was when Mary Lou Liggitt, put 
on a convincing portrayal of Old 
Nick. The formal tea will be held 
in Whitfield hall on Sunday, Oc
tober 26.
Intercollegiate Debating
An intercollegiate debating club 
will be reinstated on the Carnegie 
campus at a meeting on Wednes
day, October 22, at 4:30 p.m. in 
IH 129B.
During the war years most col
leges dropped this activity be
cause of the increased intensity 
of college training. However, all 
the district colleges, with the ex
ception of Carnegie Tech, have 
once again resumed this activity 
on a much larger scale than ex
isted before the war.
In the process of formulation is 
a plan for extensive intra-city 
college debating.
Edward McGehee, senior man
agement, is sponsoring this activ
ity and hopes to see Carnegie 
Tech take a part in this debating 
circle.
Freshman Clubs
Freshmen j women wishing to 
join the frosh clubs should report 
to the Recreation hall in Margaret 
Morrison at 4:30 p. m. on Thurs
day, October 23.
The program of freshmen clubs, 
started in response to the desires 
expressed in the poll taken at the 
freshman dinner, is sponsored by 
the Carnegie Womens Christian 
Association. However it will be 
run by the freshmen women them
selves.
Cabinet members of the CWCA 
will be advisers and will plan the 
first meetings, which will deal 
with orientation to the campus
Three hundred canvases, select
ed from all over the country, com
prise the current show at the Car
negie Museum. These canvases 
are symbols of and commentary 
on our times, for they deal with 
our industry, farms, and people.
Although most of the canvases 
were produced in the last two 
to five years, few touch oh the 
war and its repercussions, but 
rather deal with the country prior 
to the recent conflict. But of 
course one can note traces of the 
effects of the last six years, both 
in styles of painting and of exe
cution.
Although this series of show
ings is comparatively young, hav
ing begun in 1940, it has gained 
much recognition and has this 
year taken over the time formerly 
give the famous Carnegie Interna
tional. It will continue until De
cember 7.
I was particularly pleased to 
see for once a show well mounted. 
The walls were not too crowded 
and the pictures were grouped
After that the type of meeting will 
be decided by members of each organization.
Scotch and Soda
Scotch n Soda club has issued 
a reminder that all the entries in 
the contest to select the book and 
music for this years production 
must be submitted by 5:00 p.m., 
October 31. The winning entry 
will be announced at a general 
meeting of the club which will 
be held in conjunction with a 
party during the early part of 
November.
The exact date of the party will 
be announced when final arrange
ments are completed. Thistle hall 
will be the scene of the festivities, 
to which all thespians who con
tributed to last years memorable 
production, Rock n Riot, are in
vited. The music and a resume of 
the book for this years produc
tion will be previewed at the par
ty.
Math Colloquium
All students are invited to at
tend the first of a series of Mathe
matical Colloquium lectures 
Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in Room 12 
of Webb hall. Professor Eric 
Reisnner of M.I.T. will lecture on 
Finite Deformations of Shells of 
Revolution. Web Hall is the re
cent building enterprise on the 
cut adjacent of the Fine Arts 
building.
well, both as to size and schools 
of painting. On the other hand, 
I was disappointed that there were 
few abstract, surrealist, or non
objective paintings. Those that 
were shown I consider excellent, 
although the general public has 
termed them monstrosities.
Of the leaders in the show, first 
prize went to Zoltn Sepesny for 
his Marine Still Life. Although he 
is an exponent of a meticulous 
technique and is a superb colorist, 
taking tempera into ranges pre
viously unknown. I still found his 
canvas heavy and unbalanced and 
his subject dull.
Joseph Hirsch, taking second 
prize with his The Ice Man, 
conveyed the essence of feeling. 
Although his work was more ab
stract than any of the others, it 
was pure painting in quality, 
texture and color.
The third ranking place was 
Eric Isinburgers Playing the 
Banjo, fresh with humility, ten
derness, and warmth, and done 
with an eye and a brush for symplicity of design and color.
This show was, in summary, as 
good and as sincere a grouping of 
canvases as I have seen.
Employment Notice
Dean Dickinson requests that 
all students who were employ
ed in the Pittsburgh area this 
summer, whether or not they 
obtained their positions through 
the school part-time employ
ment office, report to Miss 
Stewart in his office.
Baby sitting jobs are avail
able for any girls who are in
terested in that type of work. 
All those interested should see 
Miss Stewart.
Typists, Draftsmen
The Technical is desperately 
in need of typists and drafts
men for its business and layout 
staffs, respectively. It will be 
greatly appreciated if all those 
interested in filling these posi
tions will contact the person

or report to the office of the 
Technical in the Union any 
Saturday afternoon between 
12:30 and 2:30.
Pep Rally Fire, 
Kiltie Band 
Draw Crowd
Loudspeakers Installed 
As WCIT Broadcasts 
Student Cheers, Songs
The first big pep rally of the 
year announced itself last Friday 
evening by the battle cries echo
ing from the Tech Bowl. The Kil
tie band tied up traffic on Forbes 
street as the members marched 
between the dorms and fraternity 
houses issuing the summons to 
the rally. Meanwhile the PiKas 
had put their pledges to work 
carrying wood for the huge bon
fire that later lighted the field. A 
loudspeaker system had been in
stalled to facilitate the organiza
tion of the program, and announc
ers were present to describe the 
action over station WCIT.
The Kiltie band, as it marched 
on the field, was greeted by a 
roar from those that had already 
been attracted there by the fire. 
Following a short talk by Les 
Engle, who was the master of 
ceremonies, the action really roll
ing into high gear. The cheer
leaders were on hand to direct 
the noise and did a good job of 
keeping the crowd together. Sev
eral groups carried bells and 
horns to add variety to the conufsion. As voices grew hoarse af
ter a series of cheers, the band 
came to the rescue to rest the 
strained throats.
The program was a success as 
far as all who attended were con
cerned. However, from an observ
ers point of view, several things 
were lacking. A turnout of 500 
people is a large group, but it is 
small when we consider the total 
enrollment of 3600.
About 80 per cent of the total 
turnout was composed of students 
who live on campus. The com
muters were notable by their ab
sence. It was also quite evident 
that very few students knew the 
school songs and yells until after 
the entire group repeated them 
several times.
Tiny Wolfe Plays 
For Nov. 1 Dance
The first Evening Student Coun
cil dance of the year will be held 
Saturday evening, November 1, 
in Thistle hall with Tiny Wolfe 
and his nationally known orches
tra furnishing the music.
Tickets may be purchased from 
any member of the Evening Stu
dent Council, from Plaid staff 
members, and from Mr. McKelway, whose office is in Industries 
hall.
Lang Thompson was originally 
scheduled to play for the dance, 
but his orchestra was disbanded, 
and other arrangements had to 
be made. Tiny Wolfe was secured 
through the efforts' of Dean Dick
inson and George Bogovich, social 
chairman.
We hope this change in or
chestras will not keep evening 
students from attending the 
dance, said Mr. Bogovich. Those 
people who have already pur
chased their tickets at the previ
ous rate will be refunded the 
difference in cost.

Carnegie Harriers Open Season 
Against Geneva Team Saturday
The Tartan booters successfully 
opened their 1947 campaign by 
easily defeating Frostburg State 
Teachers, 6-3, in a game played 
at Frostburg, Md. Ten lettermen 
and one newcomer were in the 
starting lineup for the Skibos.
The team jumped to an early 
lead by booting three successive 
goals during the first five min
utes of play. Don Hart scored the 
initial tally by breaking through 
the center of Frostburgs defense.
Then Len Kroko raced down the 
sidelines, booted the ball high in 
front of the goal over to George 
Moraes who scored. George con
verted again on a penalty kick 
after Kroke had coen tripped in 
the penalty zone.
The game appeared to be a com
plete rout and Coach OConnor 
substituted freely, giving all of 
the thirty-three fellows who made 
the trip a chance to play. Frost
burg took advantage of this situa
tion as Wenner and Brynes scored 
two tallies in rapid succession.
This made the score 3-2 before 
the first team went back in. The 
Tartans didnt waste any time and 
just before halftime George 
Moraes scored again for his third 
tally of the day. Half time score: 
Tech 4Frostburg 2.
The home team dominated play 
throughout the third period and 
the Tartan booters were hard 
pressed in a defensive stand. A1 
Gelbin, a freshman, played a fine
game in the backfield, alternating 
between halfback and fullback.
Wenner scored once again for 
Frostburg and the score stood 4-3. 
The Skibos were not to be out
done, with Hart scoring the fifth 
goal on a beautiful pass from 
Howie Gartner.
Just to put the game on ice, Bill 
de Vos, the only newcomer on 
the Tartan first string, booted the 
final and sixth tally just before 
the end of the contest.
Our booters are much improv
ed over the 1946 team. The strong 
front line and the depth in re
serves should help the Tartans 
towards a successful season.
On Friday, October 24, you can 
see the boys in action when they 
play Slippery Rock, last years TriState champions. Slippery Rock 
again has a fine team with a rec
ord of three wins and no losses 
so far this year. This promises to 
be one of the toughtest games of 
the year.

The Carnegie Tech Cross Coun
try Team will formally open their 
1947 season in a dual meet with 
Genevas Covenanters at Flagstaff 
Hill on Saturday, October 25.
Captain Ivor Davies and Gene 
Cockrell will be the only veter
ans that Coach Guy Halferty will 
send to the starting post. The 
Plaid hopes for victory will hinge 
largely on the efforts of the fresh
man entry of Bill Johnson, Fred 
Price, and Frank Beitel.
The B squad lifted the sea
sonal lid informally last Satur
day going down to defeat, 24-31, 
to the Jeannette harriers. A short, 
barrell-chested twenty-five year 
old speedster, Frank Cemy, broke 
the tape for Jeannettee with a winning time of 15 minutes and 26 
seconds. The first Tartan to cover 
the two and a half mile course 
was Cockrell who was clocked 
in 15:35 and placed third. John
son copped fourth with a time of 
16:53 while Ed Shoemaker fol
lowed in sixth place in 18:34. 
Rounding out the Carnegie scor
ing in sixth and seventh places 
were Price at 18:45 and Herb 
Zischkau, 19:03. Other Tech men 
in the order of their appearance 
at the finish were Bob Herbert, 
John Mays, and Bob Stephens.
To this group Coach Halferty 
will add Davies, Beitel, Dick 
Childs, and perhaps a few others 
to comprise the squad for the 
Geneva engagement.
The Carnegie Tech football 
team opened its season last 
Saturday afternoon by losing a 
tongh decision to the West Vir
ginia Wesleyan Bobcats 27-6. 
The game was marked by a 
stubborn Tartan defense that 
held the visitors in check 
throughout the first half and 
the scoring of Carnegies first 
touchdown in four years.
After the Skibos took the 
kick off to start the game, the 
Tartan hopes for victory damp
ened as little Jerry Helland, 
touted to be Techs chief offensive 
threat, was injured as he fell on 
his arm and dislocated his elbow. 
At present it is not known how 
long he will be out of action. Im
mediately after, Carnegie kicked 
and the Bobcats started a march 
down the field. In eight plays the 
visitors covered 54 yards before 
finally being stopped at the Car
negie four yard line as Wes Ken
ney knocked down a pass in the 
end zone. For the remainder of 
the first quarter the team bat
tled back and forth in Skibo ter
ritory to end the period in a tie.
In the second quarter, the Tar
tans started on their memorable 
drive to a touchdown. Standing 
on his own twenty yard line, Larry 
Maley wound up and threw a high 
looping pass which Johnny Wil
liamson picked out of the air on 
the West Virginia forty yard line. 
Premo Pappafava picked up six 
yards around left end and then 
Maley pitched a bullet pass over 
the center of the line to William
son who snake-hipped his way 
down to the twenty yard line.
Pappafava then tried the line 
twice more for four yards before 
Maley threw to Williamson again 
in the right flat. Johnny was un
able to get his hands on the ball, 
but the officials detected interfer
ence on the play and Carnegie had 
a first down on the seven yard 
line.
Pappafava then took over as he 
rounded the left end for gains of 
six yards, 1 yard, and then one 
inch for a touchdown.
The visitors managed to reor
ganize their forces and drive for 
a touchdown as the half ended in 
a 6-6 deadlock.
During the intermission the Kil
tie band put on their usual ex
cellent showing. As their most 
wamly applauded stunt they 
formed the Scottie with the wag
ging tail which has become a 
Skibo tradition.
In the second half the scoring 
was all in favor of West Virginia 
i but that is no indication of the 
closeness of the contest. The sta
tistics showed Carnegie with 11 
first down as against only 14 for 
the visitors. In total yards gained, 
,West Virginia led the Tartans by 
only 35 yards, indicating that Bill 
Donahue has turned up with an 
offense that will score many points 
in the coming games.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Creguts Sports Scope *
Lone Tartan Touchdown March 
Overshadows Results of Game
The drought is over. As the rains came on Saturday to relieve 
a parched Pittsburgh, so did the points come to satiate the touchdown 
starved Carnegie Tech students. For the members of the team, it was 
the culmination of a determination not to have a season like the last 
one. The final result of the game is very easily lost in the thrill 
of that march down the field.
To many of the fans in the stands who had sat glumly for years 
watching the Tartan teams being^- 
pushed from one end of the field 
to the other, seldom being able 
to make two consecutive first 
downs, that touchdown was one 
of the great thrills of a de-emphasized football era. When view
ed in the light that 1t was scored 
against a team that had had its 
goal line crossed only once in 
three games, it was even more im
pressive.
The lions share of the credit 
for that touchdown must go to 
Johnny Williamson, Larry Maley 
and Premo Pappafava who spark
ed the drive. Johnny got off the 
bench to which he had been rele
gated by a blood clot in his leg, 
and bad leg and all made some 
of the most phenomenal catches
the Tartans have come up with 
in many a year. And then Larry 
Maley did a beautiful pob of put
ting those passes within William
sons reach and directing the team 
masterfully right across the goal 
line.
Then, of course Pappy Pappa
fava who carried the ball 6 times 
in the course of the touchdown 
drive cant be forgotten  who 
crashed from the seven yard line 
to the 1 yard line, and then to the 
1 inch line, and finally over for 
the six points. Pappy, as was 
every other member of the team, 
was convinced that the Tartans 
were going to score today and,

Varsity Basketball Practice 
Opens With Large Turnout
Varsity basketball practice was 
officially begun last Wednesday 
at 4:30 at the Tech gym. Some 
fifty students reported for the first 
session in one of the largest turn
outs in the schools history. Di
recting the practice was Mel Cratsley, who will serve as assistant 
coach during the coming season.
Five lettermen were among the 
group that reported Wednesday, 
including Katsellas, Theodore, 
Rheil, Matsey, and Chetlin. In ad
dition to these veterans, there 
were many freshmen who have 
had much high school experience.
Generally, the squad looked im
pressive in the first day of prac
tice, and there is wide optimism 
that the coming basketball season 
will be one to look forward to 
with reasonable expectations.
Strengthening the coaching staff 
this year will be Mel Cratsley, one 
of the brightest stars in CIT floor 
history. Mel graduated in 1940 
after having set a floor scoring 
record which stands to this day.
While playing in the East 
intercollegiate basketball leaf 
now defunct, Mel had the 
night of his career as he see 
34 points against West Virgini; 
set what stands as the league . 
ord. The league, which inclu
Mel Cratsley
Tech, Pitt, Georgetown, Temple, 
Penn State, and West Virginia, 
was disbanded in the 1939-40 sea
son after Tech had taken the 
championship. A polio epidemic 
had caused the play-off games to 
be postponed and the winner was 
decided by the flip of a coin over a 
three-way telephone conversation.
Mel also played football as an 
end, but hampered by a very bad 
leg, he was only able to play sec
ond string on the 1938 Sugarbow' 
team.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1947
Council Votes
[Continued from page 1] 
quorum was not present. The 
meeting was delayed 20 minutes 
as a result of this difficulty and 
important actions taken at the 
meeting can technically be set 
aside at the next meeting at which 
a legal quorum appears.
IH Dissolved
The motion to revoke lnterhonorary Councils constitution was 
assured of passage almost as soon 
as its chief proponent, Jack Sew
ard, brought it before the meet
ing. Several Council members ask
ed president Marshall if anyone 
was present from IH to defend 
the organization or if someone 
could even be found who might 
be questioned about it.
Marshall answered negatively
to both of these questions and 
summed up the case by recalling 
the awful butch which IH made 
of Winter Carnival, and stating 
flatly, there is no binding purpose 
in the organization, no common in
terest. I cant see why they should 
exist.
When Negley Reed proposed a 
possible procedure by which or
ganizations accused of being val
ueless could be put on trial, Mar
shall reiterated his points and 
called for a vote. There was no 
opposition and it passed unani
mously.
Fees Discussed
Paying a part of the class activ
ities honoraries initiation fees 
proved to be another type of prob
lem altogether and most of the 
hour-long meeting was spent in 
discussing the proposal and its
i ji

ramifications, and in suggesting so
lutions for it.
Charles Duffeti began the ques
tioning of the motion by wonder
ing, Where is the money coming 
from and does Student Council 
have it?
It would have to come from 
Councils appropriation, replied 
Marshall, and Council does not 
have the money to appropriate. 
Where does that initiation 
money which the activities honor
aries receive go? asked Andrew 
Sterret.
Marshall gave its distribution as 
for banquets, keys, and payment 
to the national organizations. 
Amounts Questioned 
There was further questioning 
of the amounts of money needed, 
and general agreement was reach
ed that this nebulous sum would 
probably be too large. However, 
most of Student Council'did agree 
with budget chairman Arthur Nay
lor that joining an activities hon
orary should not be a serious bur
den to anyone, and that to retain 
some of the present high initia
tion fees would discriminate 
against many deserving students.
And so the discussion of how 
much money would be needed and 
how it would be obtained was re
sumed.
School dances given by the 
honoraries were considered in the 
light of a proposal made during 
the summer that a part of dance 
profits should be 'returned to the 
sponsoring organization. Naylor fi
nally proposed that Student Coun
cil give each organization $15 per 
person initiated, and that the 
honoraries supply the remainder. 
Motion Defeated 
The new suggestion found gen
eral favor, and at the suggestion 
of Jack Seward, the original mo
tion, re-introduced by'Jack John
ston, was voted upon and defeated.
Mr. Naylors motion, restated in 
formal form, with the added note 
that Council will not pay more 
than $15 a person was passed 
unanimously. It was worded to in
clude ODK, Cwens, Scimitar, Delta 
Skull, and Mortar Board. The esti
mated cost of the motion to Coun
cil is $200 yearly.
After reading a letter from 
Charles Duffet in which he offered 
his resignation as chairman of the
SCC Suggests
[Continued from page 2] 
the committee might cull out the 
best, which could then be answer
ed after the presidents speech.
Assembliesare they worth the 
time and what to do about their 
present state of acute obscurity 
occupied the meeting from the filet 
mignon through cake a la mode 
and a little beyond.
That virtually all past assembly 
hours were failures and that, if 
the present program is continued 
without modification future as
semblies would be no better was 
the starting point for this discus
sion.
President Doherty, obviously fa
miliar with this type of discus
sion, came to the core of the mat
ter in a hurry.
Its a problem of school spirit, 
he said. That problem has been 
discussed and has remained un
solved every year which I have 
been here.
If you have a football team 
which wins most of its games, then 
there will be some interestbut 
not too much. I attended the Pep 
Rallies in 1936, 37, and 38 when
publications committtee owing to 
lack of time, president Marshall 
appointed Negley Reed to the va
cated post.
The publications committee 
stated Marshall, will be active 
during the coming year. A meet
ing attended by the editor and 
business manager of the Tartan, 
Technical, Cano, Thistle, Scottie, 
will be run under parliamentary 
procedure.
Budgets Accepted
The budgets of Student Council, 
Scottie, Mens Glee club, Home 
Economics club, and the chapel 
choir were accepted by the meet
ing with a minimum of question
ing and no opposition.
Student Council will now meet 
at 7:00 p. m. on Thursdays as the 
result of a motion initiated by 
Norman Larsen. The move was 
made for the convenience of the 
mfembers and to permit proper 
coverage of the meetings by the 
Tartan.
we did have a team that was real
ly something, but even then there 
was only a very small group at
tending.
Dr. Doherty noted further that 
every year the committee discusses 
school spirit, and nothing is ever 
solved. Spirit is unusually low 
right now, but it never was satis
factory even at its best.
No Time
There just isnt time. If there 
were but 15 semester hours and 
no afternoon classes, then it might 
be different. But the fundamental 
factors are just difficult to deal 
with.
When Jack Guyol of Mens Dorm 
Council called for a scientifically 
conducted investigation of the 
problem of school spirit, Dr. Do
herty replied that this had al
ready been done. The results were 
as usual.
The committee agreed, however, 
that the present tendency toward 
an increase in spirit plus the work 
of the public relations bureau 
would make a few further trials 
of the assembly hour worthwhile.
Expressing the pleasure of the 
student body at the moving of 
Dean Dickinsons office to quar
ters where fifty people at a time 
can wait for an audience with him 
in comparative comfort, Tartan 
editor Hubert Aaronson pointed 
out that this action had been sug
gested to the president by the 
Spring Conference committee.

Cregut Says
[Continued from page 5] 
seeing the opportunity, he was not 
to be denied.
While the work of these three 
fellows was the most outstanding, 
the play of the line was the big
gest revelation. They made the 
West Virginia forward wall look 
like a seive. Time after time, the 
Wesleyan backfield looked like it 
had six men instead of four, as 
Maxton and Wiseman or Shapiro 
and Meyers broke through time 
after time to harass the visitors. 
The linemen did the afternoons 
dirty work and they did a good 
job.
Anyone who didnt see the game  
and didnt know the final score 
might get the impression from 
this article that Carnegie won. Un
fortunately, such was not the 
case. There was just too much 
Pugh. Walt and Bill Pugh, the 
Wesleyan brother combination 
came to Pittsburgh heralded as 
the backbone of their running 
game and they certainly lived up 
to expectations. Bill would run 
the right end and Walt would run 
the left end, and then they would 
start over again the same way. The 
inability of the Tartan ends to 
turn the plays inside allowed the 
Pughs to pick up ten or fifteen 
yards every time they ran the 
ends. In the final score these boys 
were the difference.
It is unfortunate that the SkiThor Explains

quorum for election of officers, 
and Thor had to remain as the 
only officer. He feels that the or
ganization has served its purpose 
and that there is no longer a real 
need for it, evidenced by the fact 
that it has not flourished. In his 
own words, Disintegration set in 
because of lack of purpose.
Small Treasury
When informed that Steiner 
wanted to revive Tecvets, Thor 
said that he would be glad to co
operate in every way. He agreed 
to turn over the constitution and 
all funds to the new group, should 
one really spring to life on cam
pus. He also emphasized his view 
that Tecvets should continue to be 
a non-factional group represent
ing veteran interests in general, 
rather than a political organiza
tion whose main aim would be to 
buck the fraternities and Citcom.
bos three toughest games have to 
face them on the first three Sat
urdays. Geneva next week and W. 
and J. the following week will be 
bitter games for the boys to pick 
up the experience they need. But 
if the team can get by these two 
without too many injuries or with 
out irreparable loss to their mo
rale, it appears that we can look 
for some vicories in the last three 
games.
Can YOU name one thing that cost a nickel years ago, 
that still costs a nickel today, and that is actually better 
, value for your nickel now than it was then?
We can.
Its the local telephone call that you can make when you 
drop a nickel in the slot of a pay telephone.I
You get speedier service ... you can talk to more people, 
more naturally and hear more clearly . . . and both the 
equipment you see and the equipment you dont see are 
amazingly improved.
To improve the quality of telephone service is a constant 
objective of the telephone business . . . and it is because 
we have never lost sight of this objective that you enjoy 
good telephone service at low cost.

4Technical9 To Sponsor Contest 
Of A meriean Welding Society
The Mechanical Engineering 
department has acquired two icemaking plants for instruction pur
poses while the Metallurgical en
gineers now have a tensile testing 
machine of 200,000 pounds capac
ity and a stationary floor type in
dustrial X-ray unit. Miscellane
ous electronics instruments were 
acquired by the department of 
Electrical Engineering.
Materials such as these are 
available to all colleges which are 
training students under the G.I. 
Bill, but to be sure of acquiring 
material they must keep a close 
watch on War Assets material lists 
and then apply immediately for 
the equipment desired.
The Carnegie Technical has an
nounced its sponsorship on this 
campus of the annual contest held 
by the American Welding Society 
to obtain the best paper on weld
ing to be written by an under
graduate engineering student.
Papers on any phase of welding 
which are published in the Tech
nical before May 15, 1948, are 
eligible for prizes under the A. F.
Davis Undergraduate Welding 
Award of the American Welding 
Society. Both the authors of the 
prize-winning articles and the 
campus magazines in which they 
are published will receive $200 as 
the first prize, and $150 second 
prize.
In addition, undergraduate stu
dents in any branch of engineer
ing, without necessarily submit
ting articles to their local periodi
cals, may compete in the award 
and scholarship program of the 
James F. Lincoln Arc Welding 
Foundation, of Cleveland, Ohio.
Prizes in this contest, in which 
the subject matter is limited to 
the field of arc welding, include a 
total of 77 cash payments to the 
individuals submitting the best ar
ticles, as well as scholarship funds 
to be granted to the departments 
of the institutions in which the 
first three winners are registered.
The subject matter of papers 
competing for the Davis awards 
may concern any phase of any 
type of welding or its application 
to design and construction. The 
articles will be judged on their 
originality and the thoroughness 
with which the material is pre
sented.
Students competing for the Lin
coln Awards should deal with de
signs for the arc welding of ma
chines, structures, and industrial 
and agricultural equipment in 
need of repair.
Further information on the two 
contest programs can be secured 
by contacting William Carpenter, 
publicity manager of the Techni
cal.

Tecvets Revive
[Continued from page 1]
The new Tecvets is viewed pri
marily as a social organization, 
designed as a means of gathering 
together campus independents to 
compete in intramural athletics 
and hold closed and all-school 
dances.
Its interest in national affairs 
would be confined to committees 
and forums organized within the 
primary activity.
Most of us arent too much in
terested in those things now, and 
dont even know too much about 
them, Steiner explained.
The problem of continuing the 
organization after the veteran en
rollment has dropped to negligible 
proportions would be answered 
simply by gradually changing its 
character. ROTC students would 
first be admitted, followed by 
non-veterans.
Any preoccupation with veter
ans affairs would then disappear, 
and the organization would be
come completely campus in its 
scope.
The non-veterans can take 
over eventually he elaborated, 
and perhaps change the name 
but not the program and aims of 
the group in the process. Veterans 
affairs can be forgotten and they' 
can concentrate on things of more 
immediate interest.
But there is a place for us on 
campus, even if those previously 
in charge couldnt find it. We want 
to give the men interested in us 
a crack at sections of campus life 
which they are now missing, and 
think that we can do a goob job 
of it.
Anyone interested in joining 
this movement might call me at 
my home telephone number, 
Highland 6321 during the evening, 
and Ill talk it over with them.
When the present attempt to 
dissolve Tecvets was brought to 
Steiners attention, he concluded 
the interview by noting that this 
move might be a good one, and 
would perhaps give the new Tec
vets a chance to begin again with 
a fresh start.
The money now contained in the 
organization treasury would, how
ever, be of use in the proposed 
rebuilding.
Inttramural Open
[Continued on page 5]
so that American league games are 
played on field 1, Federal league 
games on field 2, and National 
league games on field 3. Each week 
the Tartan will carry a schedule 
of the games to be played during 
that week.
Last week all the teams had 
their entire squads out on the field 
for rugged, and generally ragged, 
practice sessions. The common 
practice was for one squad to 
practice its own plays in an intra
squad game, and then engage in 
a contest with one of the other 
teams. These battles proved to be 
quite bloody as most of the play
ers were struggling for first team 
berths.
This football season should turn 
out to be the beginning of a very 
successful intramural program. 
Since each team has twelve mem
bers, the three leagues represent 
216 men actively participating in 
the program. One of the major 
drawbacks, however, is a shortage 
of referees and linesmen. At this 
time, Mr. See would like to is
sue a call for any men experienc
ed in these jobs. As an added in
ducement officials are paid $1.00 
per game.
