Coriolanus Opens 
Tomorrow Night
Among the most rarely per
formed of all of William 
Shakespeares plays is Coriolanus which is being presented 
by the Department of Drama from 
March 9 to 19. As is usual with 
the plays of Shakespeare, a few 
extra performances will be given, 
including two matinees on March
15 and 10.
This is the first performance of 
Coriolanus in Pittsburgh, and 
it is among the very few produc
tions ever done in America. The 
last production was by the Fed
eral Theatre several years ago in 
New York City. That version 
was the first in forty years.
Controversial Play
An outstanding incident con
cerned with a late production of 
this drama was a recent presenta
tion in Paris. The piny, greatly 
concerned with political intrigue 
and incidents, caused rioting be
tween Communists and Fascists. 
The French government was 
forced to demand the withdrawal 
of the production.
The entire department is involv
ed in this production. The mob, 
which according to the co-di
rectors, Mary Morris and Henry 
Boettcher, is as important as any 
of the principals in the drama, 
is made up of the entire Fresh
man class and some of the up
perclassmen.

Sisson, Chapin 
Are Double-Cast
By Ruth Brodie
Although Shakespeare Wouldnt 
like it very much (and Sheridan 
would) the Department of Dramas 
production of Coriolanus open
ing tomorrow night could well be 
sub-titled The Rivals. Not that 
theres any real rivalry between 
the two Coriolanuses, but this 
Shakespeare production climaxes 
a long series of similarities in the 
lives of Coriolanus Victor Chapin 
and Corioditto Dick Sisson.
The whole thing goes back to 
September, 1936, when two wouldbe freshmen came to Tech, qualted 
through their drama technicals, 
and were ceremoniously trans
formed from would-be freshmen 
into just plain freshmen. The two 
plebes, of course, were out two 
protagonists (we said protagonists) 
the boy Sisson and the boy Chapin.
A few months of freshman crew 
reveals anyones true character, 
and the young stagc-sweepers soon 
discovered that they were kindred 
soulswell, anyhow, that they 
could stand the sight of each other. 
So they became fast friends.
Due to the enervating quality 
of the Pittsburgh climate (have 
you noticed?) and an inherent 
sweetness in our heroes natures, 
1938 (last year) found them still 
fast friends. It also found them 
double-cast for the first timeas 
Henry Abbott in Kind Lady.
Came September of this year, 
came wars and rumors of wars, 
and also rumors that the annual 
Shakespeare show would be Cor
iolanus. Came also Mr. Chapin 
three days late for registration to 
discover that his room-mate was 
to behow did you guess itMr. 
Sisson!
Rooming together (so they tell 
us) entails an exchange of ideas 
and confidences, and one of the 
twowe dont know which one 
must have broken down and dis
closed the roots of his family tree. 
Anyhow, the Drama Department 
was one day shaken with the news 
that their two Golden Boys 
(still meaning Sisson and Chapin) 
were fourth cousins once removed! 
We wont go into the details of 
the kinship. Its very involved

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANFRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1940
Cross-Talk Oit NYA Cut
NYA aid to students was an outgrowth of the depression. 
In 1930 and 31 the number oi: students attending colleges and 
high schools throughout the United States dropped alarmingly. 
Difficult family conditions caused students to leave school to 
seek employmentbut there were no jobs to be had, and many 
became drifters." The act providing for the establishment of 
a National Youth Administration was at first an emergency 
measure.'
A recent chart, the result of research by the Unemployment 
Division of the CJ.O, shows clearly that since the beginning of 
1939 the federal governments expenditures for armaments have 
increased as the expenditures for hid (in the form of WPA, 
NYA, etc.) have decreased. It seems that the government has 
found a new solution to the-problem of needy youththe army, 
or at least indirectly so, since that conclusion follows a priori 
from the chart mentioned above.
The latest move to cut NYA appropriations was that re
cently proposed by President Roosevelt, advocating a $15,000,- 
000 (15%) reduction. The Presidents intended cut has aroused 
some controversy. In a recent report by Dean Ackerman of the 
Graduate School of Journalism of Columbia University to the 
President of the University a survey was quoted in which stu
dents were supposed to have opposed government aid in financ
ing education.
During a recent Congressional debate a representative an
swered Dean Ackermans survey with the report of'Dean Willey 
.of the University of Minnesota, who said that Ackermans im
plications as they pertain to the responsibility of the govern
ment in aiding deserving college students cannot go unchal
lenged . . . With rising educational costs it becomes progressive
ly difficult, as one descends the family earnings scale, for youth 
to find the resources with which to enter and remain in college. 
All. studies of scholastic accomplishment of NYA students, at 
Minnesota and elsewhere, show it to be high. There is every 
reason to believe that without the NYA assistance,, large num
bers of these successful students would be unable to complete 
their education. The alternative to some form of assistance for 
impoverished students of promise is education on the basis of 
ability to pay, which strikes at the very heart of democratic 
principles and tradition.
Needless to say, we agree with Dean Willey. And, further
more, wo feel that the education of our youth is more important 
'than the present preparations for their destruction.

Dr. Doherty Explains Athletic, 
Fees Policies of Administration
Emphasizing that Carnegie is 
above all an educational institu
tion, President Robert E. Doherty 
discussed the athletic policy of the 
administration before an audience 
of students and faculty in the The
ater, College of Fine Arts, Tuesday 
morning.
No Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology funds, including athletic 
receipts, will be used to pay or 
support an athlete because he is 
an athlete, Dr. Doherty said. 
Neither will he be denied assist
ance he would receive as a student, 
if he were not an athlete.
Athletes must meet the same ad
mission, scholastic and graduation 
requirements as other students, 
the President pointed out.
Aid From Alumni 
This does not preclude, however, 
aid from friends and alumni, pro
vided it is done in accordance with 
an approved plan with all opera
tions and financial accounts open 
and above-board.
Under no circumstances is Car
negie interested in gsyhvlt from 
athletics, Dr. Doherty said.
Mus .Swiiijj Session
The administration is eager for 
sports in which the -largest possi
ble number of students can take 
part, the President stated, and it 
was to this end that he initiated a 
study of the athletic situation.
The results of this study has 
been the successful program of in
tramural athletics built on the 
basis of wide student participation.
Increase in Tuition 
With regard to the increase in 
tuition fees, President Doherty 
pointed out that the steady decline 
in returns on invested endowment 
funds has forced Carnegie to op
erate at a deficit for the past few 
years. There was no way out of 
the difficulty except increasing 
fees to meet the losses.
Di\ Doherty answered the stu
dents familiar objection to a Sat
urday classes by expjlaining that 
were Saturday sessions eliminated, 
the result would be a jamming of 
class hours on weekdays which 
would make extra-curricular ac
tivity almost impossible.
A period of lively discussion and 
questions from the audience fol
lowed Dr. Dohertys presentation.

Harry James To Be Featured 
At Interfraternity March 15
With the winning of the highest 
honors that could be, gained on his 
instrument, that of the outstand
ing trumpet player in the country 
by a vote of his fellow musicians, 
Harry James comes to Techs an
nual Interfraternity Formal Dance. 
The V'-11 to be held at the Hotel
From 0:30 to 12:80 is a power
ful long time to go without a bite 
of food to keep body and soul 
together. At least, 1 think it is, 
and since I have the kind of un
holy schedulo that keeps me 
.sprinting from one end oi! the 
campus to the other, theres hard
ly time for me to stop in at the 
Hennery and grab a flfty-cent spe
cial mid-morning snack, its un
derstandable, then, why I shoot 
through the door like an adoles
cent streak of lighting as soon 
as the 12:20 bell rings, and why 
I very much resent being stopped 
on my way to the food. A short 
time ago, therefore, when a young 
man, a young lady, and a table 
thrust a ballot in my face and 
demanded that I vote for the Snow 
Queen, I resented it. I wasnt/ 
angry, but I resented it very much. 
But I gave some girl on the list 
the support of my powerful po
litical machinecontrolling ' one 
unanimous voteand went on in 
the direction of the soup or fruit 
juice, muttering ancient Rhunic 
curses as I ran.
The incident started me think
ing, however. Every couple of 
months, in a frantic effort to es
tablish a Tech tradition (and to 
accomplish other, more practical 
things) someone prevails upon the 
student body to vote for a Queen 
of something.^ There are Varsity 
Queens and Snow Queens and Bal
loon Queens, and, of course, the 
Queen de la Queen, the Campus 
Queen. I sort of got to figuring
that if Tech has got to go in for 
cheesecake, it ought to have a 
queen representative of Pittsburgh 
and the weather and the feeling 
you get when youve got to get 
up in the dead of night for an 
0:110. Thats the real Tech spirit. 
And since I go around all winter 
looking like something that just 
came out of a Bessemer converter 
chimney, T take this opportunity 
of throwing my snood into the 
ring as a candidate for the Smog 
Queen.
Something good and traditional 
could be made out of this, dont 
you think? The usual publicity 
pictures of the Queen and her 
Court could be in the papers. Of 
course, mine may not be the type 
of beauty that could stand up so 
well in the cold New England light 
of Vassar or Wellesley, but a 
fetching smudge of the Smog 
Queen completely obscured by the 
smog would be a fitting adorn
ment for any Pittsburgh paper. 
(The caption could read Tech 
collegiate in her natural habitat.) 
The Queen would wear a white 
velvet dress that had been left 
out on the line overnight, and 
her crown would be a string of 
cold ashes. Her theme song would 
be variations on the theme of the 
asthmatic cough, and her coat of 
arms two fog-horns rampant on a 
field of soot. I like the idea and

Harrys young band has been on 
an extended one-night tour of 
colleges and dance halls in the 
east. By classifying it as a young 
of his players.
Features Young Musicians
One outstanding example in his 
recent signing to an arranging con
tract of 19-year old Hoyt Jone of 
Northwestern University. Hoyt, 
a piano player, has never had a 
music lesson in his life, and be
gan his arranging by listening to 
phonograph records. He is one 
of the youngest arrangers in his 
field.
Another newcomer is featured 
vocalist Fran Hines who replaced 
Frank Sinatra. The latter is now 
with Tommy Dorsey. Three of 
Harrys outstanding musicians are 
Dave Mathews, a sax player who 
left Benny Goodmans band with 
Harry to help in the organization 
of this new band; trombonist 
Bruce Squires, who has been with 
Goodman, Bunny Berigan and Bob 
Crosby; and guitarist Red Kent. 
Trumpeter Jack Palmer, besides 
assuming his musical duties, helps 
in the vocal field.
James Is Versatile
Besides playing the trumpet, 
this six-foot,one-inch band leader 
has many other musical qualities 
that show why he rates top in his 
profession. He can also play 
drums, as may be shown by the 
fact that when Gene Krupa left

FRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1940THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
SKIBO SPORTS SLANTS
FRESHMEN CAGERS HAVE SUCCESSFUL 
SEASON
--By DOC" BURKE, Sports Editor
With not one scholarship man on the squad, Carnegie Techs 
Freshman hasketeers have done much better than fair for themBelves. Of twelve games played the boys managed to come out 
on the long end of the score seven times.
Although this record does not appear too enviable, it must 
be kept in mind that not one game was lost on the home court. 
Moreover, none of tho teams played defeated the yearlings 
more than once. Among the Plebes victims were the Freshman 
teams of Penn State, West Virginia, and Duquesne. All these 
schools are well loaded with scholarship men, West Virginia 
having three former All-State stars in their line-up.
Perhaps the record would have been better had not the 
team been hampered by injuries and ineligibility. Those forced 
out of the line-up by these evils were Miles Span, Joe Luther, 
and Dave Brinn, all of whom know their way around on a basket
ball court. Hugh Smith, Wally Patton, and Sam Calser played 
on the first string the entire season, being ably assisted by the 
above three and Irv Kaplan, Whitey Moorman, Jack Meyers, 
and Athanasius Stosny.
No little of the credit for the good showing of the Frosh 
must go to Mel Cratsley and Speedo Friedlander who ably 
tutored the boys.
If all the above mentioned boyswith the exception of 
Miles Span who is out for goodreturn to school next year, 
Der Maxie should turn up with a good team.
LIFE SAVING TO BE TAUGHT
Again this year life saving will be taught at Carnegie. This 
instruction 1 been vory successful in the past and a large 
group is expected again this year.
The ultimate object of this course is to receive the Senior 
Life Saving Certificate, which is a requirement to be a life guard 
at most beaches. Instruction will be by that saver of lives, Bob 
Dominy, who has been a life guard at the shore the past few 
years.
Anyone interested should report at the Tech Pool tomor
row between 2:00-2:30 P. M. Details may be obtained there. oooorm
If we may be permitted (we ask permission because of pre
vious attempts) we would like to predict that Duquesnes basket
ball team will go to tho finals of the National Tournament this 
coming week in New York . . .
Has anyone noticedor maybe were wrongthe particu
larly poor officiating at basketball games this year? Some of 
the officials handle games vory well, but these are in the mini
mum. It seems that not oven the captain of a team can 
objoct in tho least to certain poor decisions (remember the Duquesno game?). .If something is not done about the sad situa
tion, basketball in this district will suffer.

Now that spring practice in the 
major baseball leagues has def
initely gotten under way, and 
tho managers are Ironing out all 
of their slgnout problems, comes 
the time for a little discussion on 
tho diamond subject.
To our oyos It looks like the 
Yankees, now with Ruffing, Rolfe, 
and DiMagglo definitely in tho 
fold to repeat once more. Joe Mc
Carthy has the power in every 
position to come through to vic
tory, and should lie fail to do so, 
barring injuries, it might be con
sidered the biggest upset of the 
3940 sports season. With Rolfe, 
Crossetti, Gordon, and Dahlgren 
holding down the infield posts, 
and youngster Buddy Blair fight
ing for a job there, it looks like 
an air-tight inner defense. Rucing and Gomez with Jorgens and 
Dickey will hold down the top 
battery honors and should come 
through with ilying colors.
Tho fight for the National 
League pennant will again be a 
tough fight right through to the 
finish. The leaders will be last 
years champs, the Cincinnati 
Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Dont count the Brooklyn Dodgers, 
now in possession of Joe Vosmik 
out of the race. They may sur
prise everybody.
It looks like the promise that 
Paavo Nurmi made was right 
about his protege, Maki, for he 
certainly came through with fly
ing colors in his indoor debut out 
in California. He may set a

one of the poorer contests of the 
year, for the Skibo splashers dom
inated the show from beginning .to 
end. The final score of this water 
fracas was 46 to 20.
Coach Risedorph, realizing from 
advanced information concerning 
the caliber of the opposition, that 
the visitors were not too strong, 
used many oi! his second team 
swimmers. However, these Plaid 
mermen were good enough to pro
vide a winning margin for the 
good Coach. Among these Car
negie warriors can be listed such 
men as Zimmerman, Cooper, Fox, 
and Lieblich. To such men as 
these Carnegie athletic teams have 
much to be thankful.
The crowning light of the aft
ernoons activities was the 400 
yard free style relay, in which a 
new Carnegie team record was 
set. This new mark was achiev
ed by the combined efforts of 
Jimmy Lochhead, Bill Molvie, 
Harold Ilirsch, and Bob Vance.
The previous team record stood 
at three minutes fifty seven sec
onds, this mark being held by the 
team of 1934; the new record be
ing three minutes and fifty five 
seconds. This is a mark the pres
ent team has been trying to reach 
all season, congx-atulations are in 
order for the  attaining of such a 
goal.
Concurrent with this meet was 
held the last freshman swimming 
meet of the year, however, in this 
contest the Plebes suffered their 
third defeat of the season. After 
the meet the Freshman members 
of the .team assembled and elect
ed an Honorary Captain for the 
year. Ted Burtis, the outstand
ing free style swimmer on the 
squad, received the highest num
ber of votes in this election.
This afternoon six of the var
sity members, plus the Coach, take 
off for Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
where they will enter the An
nual E. C. S. A. races. Although 
there is not much hope of the boys 
bringing home the first place cup, 
these six senior members are cer
tainly entitled to the chance to 
display their talents before the 
swimming heads of the East.

Four Seniors To 
Play in Closing 
Game of Year
With four seniors playing their 
final game of basketball for the 
Tech Tartans, the squad will en
gage the Penn State Quintet at 
State College, Pa., tomorrow 
night. Captain Rube Stark, Jim
my Tumpane. Red Sturgeon, and 
Johnny Burke are the three Plaid 
men who will wind up their hard
wood floor activities in the col
legiate field.
The Nittany Lions came out on 
the short end of a 35 to 33 score in 
the encounter with the Skibos 
earlier in the year. The game was 
played in the Tech gym and found 
the visitors fighting gamely in the 
last few minutes to try and remapture the lead that they had let slip 
out of their grasp.
Stark Still Leads 
Captain Stark is finishing up his 
college career in fine style by re
taining his lead in the city of Pitts
burgh in points scored per game.
This culminates the entire sea
son for the Tech squad, but Max 
Hannum will have a big and ex
perienced nucleus to start out with 
next year. Red Burch, Hennessy, 
Holtes, Kirk, Alexander, Rhodes, 
Patton, and a number of other 
players will be in the ranks when 
practice starts.
Team Set For Fray 
The entire squad will be set to 
engage the Lions from State Col
lege. With Stark, Tumpane, Burch, 
Holtse, Kirk, Alexander, Rhodes, 
starters against Coach Lawthors 
five, the Techmen will have a 
as strong an outfit as they can put 
on the floor.

After Long Layoff
Donning skates for the first 
time in ahnost three weeks, the 
Carnegie Tech hockey team meets 
Penn State tonight at Johnstown, 
Pa. This venture marks the first 
time in two years that a school 
other than a member of the PerinOhio League has provided the 
competition for a Tech team.
The outcome of the game will 
depend a great deal upon the abil
ity of the Plaid outfit to recover 
their skating legs before the game 
is too far gone. Duquesne was 
hard pressed to beat State 4-1 in 
States opening game, and since 
that time they have improved 
greatly. However, if Feiler, Bur
leigh, Wilson, and the balance of 
the squad havent become too stale 
after such a prolonged lay-off, 
they should be capable of stopping 
State. '
Case Is Coming 
Tomorrow afternoon, Case 
School comes down from Cleve
land to play Tech in the first 
game of a double-header that also 
presents Duquesne vs. Fenn Col
lege. .Case is the biggest and 
roughest team in the league, and 
will make things plenty tough 
for the Tartans in an attempt to 
gain revenge for the 2-0 setback 
the Plaid handed them earlier in 
the year.
Next Tuesday, March 12, John 
Carroll comes to town to play the 
Skibos, but with these two week
end games under their belt, the 
Scotch Scooters should be back 
in fair shape and give a good ac
count of themselves.

cerning one of the intramural 
bowling rules. Failure to appear 
With at least a three man team 
within one quarter hour of sched
uled time forfeits one game; 
within one half hour forfeits 
match. In cases where only three 
or four men compose a team, a 
dummy score of 70 points will be 
credited as the score of the miss
ing men.
However, if one of the members 
of the opposing team rolls a lower 
total than 70, that total will re
place the 70 points as the dummy 
score.
Tomorrow marks the deadline 
for swimming entries. Ten prac
tice period and a health examina
tion by Doc Marks are the only 
eligibility requirements. Last year 
the intramural swimming program was highly successful, and 
a large turnout is anticipated in 
this sport for this seasons com
petition which starts on April 1.
At the present time three squads 
are monopolizing positions among 
the basketball scoring leaders. 
The Dus, with three men in the

U. of Florida won the Postal 
Match with a score of 1402, with 
Michigan State a close second 
with 1397. Techs 1391 was good

Next week, the Postal match op
ponents will be the University of 
Maryland and the U. S. Naval 
Academy. The match with these 
two great teams will be a sort of 
preview of the shoulder to 
shoulder matches with these teams 
in Maryland in two weeks. For 
the Seniors and Plebes, this is the 
big event of the year. Eight Sen
iors and Plebes make the trip. 
Among those going for the varsity
are Minton, McMillen, Greene,

Plebe squad will be cut down 
again on Saturday, and the re

Answer: An honor system, sort 
of a college civil service according 
to honor points, which would be 
given for activities. Every office 
should require the holding of a 
certain number of honor points for 
a candidate to run for that office. 
This, I think would be more ef
ficient and fair then the prevailing 
petition system. In this way those 
lacking in ability and having only 
organized backing would be elim
inated.

In line with the growing interest 
in national politics due to the com
ing presidential convention, is the 
increasing interest in campus pol
itics.
The old question of control of 
school politics by organized groups 
has arisen numerous times at 
Tech. Now you, as an individual 
will get a chance to get your two 
cents in. Come on, dont hang 
back! Have your say!
Ruth Neel Gen 42
Question: What do you think
of school politics, of the so-called 
fraternity control or dirty politics?
Answer: Frankly I dont know 
much about them. However as
suming that there is fraternity 
control, which is certainly unde
sirable, the only way to combat it, 
as far as I can see is to organize 
the unorganized students under a 
strong leader.
Everett Neff Chem. E. 41
Question: School Politics?
Answer: Fraternities are in
control of campus politics simply 
because they are the only ones in
terested and active. ' In a smaller 
and very modified way, they are 
like the national political machine. 
Most of the time fraternities sup
port their candidates as a block, 
while independents may be com
paratively unknown and almost 
always without organized control.
Question: Can you suggest a
remedy?
Answer: Only changing the at
titude of students in general, for 
their indifference is responsible for 
the way in which politics are run. 
Mary Helen OConnor, Gen 41
Question: School Politics?
Answer: Im a little ashamed to 
say I dont think much about them. 
I dont think theyre always fair.
Question: Can you think of any 
remedy?
March 11, 1915: Spring was rap
idly approaching and with it came 
the shedding of Plebe regulation 
caps and socks. The plaid caps 
were to be consumed in a huge 
bonfire with attendant ceremony 
and pomp. Black socks would 
soon be replaced by such bright 
products of the textile mills that 
the seniors would have to don 
smoked glasses to protect their 
eyes.
Early spring baseball practice 
was already in progress in the 
gym. Thirty-five men had an
swered the first call. A1 and 
Honus Wagner coached the first 
session, but left immediately 
afterwards to join the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.
The basketball team was sched
uled to close its season with 
Marietta the following night. The 
sturdy Tartans had played nine
teen games in nine weeks. It is 
little wonder that they had, suf
fered a mediocre season!
Jane Addams Spoke 
Miss Jane Addams, founder of 
Hull House in Chicago, addressed 
the student body on the Chang
ing Ideals of Peace. All classes 
were discontinued at 3:45 in order 
that every student might attend 
the meeting. Secretary U. P. 
Field presided in the absence of 
Director Hammerschlag. The lec
ture was opened and closed by the 
Student Symphony Orchestra un
der the direction of Mr. J. Vick 
OBrien.
Miss Addams pointed out that 
international problems would, in 
the end, be submitted to the Hague 
Tribunal, and rejoiced in the fact 
that, each European nation claimed 
that it was only fighting for ex
istence. In view of this, it is 
to be assumed that aggressive 
warfare is past and we have risen 
a little higher than the civiliza
tion of Napoleon.
College Boy 
Perhaps ideals of peace were 
different then, but the American 
college boy was not. The follow
ing witticism is submitted as 
proof:
Father (unexpectedly arriving 
at sons rooming house at school, 
Does Mr. James live here? 
Landlady (wearily)  Yes 
bring him in. 
At Cambridge the examination 
halls were at last put to a practic
al use. They had been converted 
into hospitals for wounded 
soldiers. Cambridge and Oxford 
would not row in their historic 
boat race this year for the first 
time since the Crimean War be
cause all the leading oarsmen 
were at the front.
Dance Lessons Offered 
R. E. Jacques, dancemaster su
preme, offered to teach the latest 
steps in a few easy lessons. Mr. 
Jacques specialized in the work 
of Vernon and Irene Castle, the 
fox trot, one step, hesitation, and 
maxisse.
Michigan football rooters who 
had made a recent trip to Chicago 
for an important game were want
ed by the police of that city for 
questioning in connection with the 
purloining of $120 worth of room 
decorations, knives, forks, and 
windowshades from the Beach 
Hotel in Chicago.
No Tickets Needed 
For Music Recital
The public is invited to the 
recital which will be given by 
students of the Department of 
Music Sunday at 8:15 P. M. No 
tickets are required.
The concert will be held in the 
Exhibition Hall, College of Fine 
Arts, instead of the Theatre where 
all the other recitals have been 
given. The program was in the 
Tuesday issue of the Tartan.

TOUT POUR LES FEMMES
Maybe you hiive decided not to 
got your spring clothes until Mr. 
Brotzman (the local weather 
man) comesout of a huddle with 
himself and announces No more 
snow, or until you find out 
whether March, which came in 
like a lamb, will go out like one, 
too. In that case, there are lots 
of little gadgets around to add 
spice to the clothes you DO have.
For instance, theres a mad lit
tle multi-colored Jeweled monkey 
to skate up and down your suit or 
coat lapel on movable roller 
skates. And a backward-looking 
Indian mamma gazing fondly 
over her shoulder at a papoose 
dangling from her back. Then 
too, theres a silly gold bear who 
spends all day riding up and down 
a sliding pole. Something en
tirely new, and utterly charming 
in clips is a chubby pair of golden 
baby hands.
Youre probably just as weary 
as we are of adding white touches 
to your dark dresses to make them 
seem more spring-like. If your 
dress has a fairly high neckline 
there is a stark white necklace of 
white china beads which reaches
halfway to your waist. With all 
dark accessories except for white 
gloves, youll be in the spotlight 
as a knockout, not a blackout.
Another possibility for your 
dark outfit is a necklace of small 
realistic gardenias of a very light
weight plastic. Perfect for filling 
in a low neckline, or with evening 
gowns.
If youve been looking for some
thing to wear with tailleurs 
something not too silly or frivol
ous, try a fat silver heart dangling 
from a pin which is an arrow from 
Cupids own bow.
Then, loo, weve seen a tall, 
long-legged flamingo with jewel
ed wings outspread ready to take 
flight after catching a tiny green 
frog in his beak. There is also a 
miniature swampland in full col
ors, complete to a lifelike alligator 
crawling through the grass.
You still remember the recent 
fad of twisting a silver spoon 
about your wrist for a bracelet 
and you know it started on one 
of the eastern girls school cam
puses. As a sort of companion 
piece to this now comes a tiny 
silver salt spoon to pin on your 
lapel.Music Dept.
