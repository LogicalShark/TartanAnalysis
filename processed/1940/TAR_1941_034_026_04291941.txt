Saturday Evening
Singing with Tommy Dorsey on 
Thursday night will be pretty 
Connie Hainesreally Yvonne 
Marie Ja Mais. Shes been with 
Tommy ever since he organized 
his present band, in 1939.
Connie had her name changed 
by Harry James, with whom she 
sang before joining up with Tom
my. ' Theres no particular reason 
for the change. James liked the 
sound of the new name. She .was 
only seventeen at the time, which 
would make one 'believe that she 
started singing when she was 
very young.
She made her debut as a child" 
singer at the age of four in a 
theatre in her home townSa
vannah, Georgia. At ten she was 
singing over the radio, and shes 
been a professional singer ever 
since. At present Connie wants to 
be a star in a Broadway musical 
but is quite contented with T.  
Dorsey.

Also featured with The Senti
mental Gentleman of Swing will 
be the Pied Pipers, a harmony 
quartette. While he was in Los 
Angeles in 1938 Tommy first 
heard the group, which was then 
a trio, and after that kept look
ing for a spot for them on his 
programs. That fall he had them 
appear on his Raleigh radio 
shows for several weeks, after 
which they went back to the 
coast. In the fall of 1939, while he 
was at the Palmer House in Chi
cago, Tommy asked them to sign 
up with him and they have been 
with him ever since. They are 
now a quartette, of course.

Kaplan 41 Wins 
Natl Math Prize
For the third consecutive year 
Edward L. Kaplan, senior in the 
Department of Mathematics, 
placed high in the Lowell Putman 
Mathematical Competition spon
sored by the Mathematical Asso
ciation of America. The Carnegie 
Tech mathematics team composed 
of Kaplan, R. E. Beatty, and N. 
H. Painter, received honorable 
mention in the contest.
During his sophomore year at 
Carnegie Tech, Kaplan won the 
competition for that year and was 
awarded a $1,000 graduate schol
arship at Harvard where he will 
go this fall. Last year he ranked 
among the first five individuals 
in the contest.
Twenty-eight colleges and uni
versities entered teams in the 
competition and 16 other colleges 
entered individual contestants 
only, thus making a total of 146 
students representing 44 institu
tions.
Kaplan has made an outstand
ing record at Carnegie Tech, hav
ing received scholarships 
throughout his four years. He was 
one of the 13 students to receive 
a straight A record for the first 
semester of this year. He is a 
member of Tau Beta Pi, national 
engineering honorary society, and 
of Phi Kappa Phi, scholastic hon
orary.
Three Days
Carnival Promises 
Good Time for All
By Phyllis Buchman
Three days! Glorious, heaven
ly, colossal, romanticcrowded 
dance floors, not enough sleep, too 
many cigarettes, not enough 
moneySpring Carnival! A-men.
But, think of a whole month of 
Spring Carnivalthe whole mer
ry month of May! Dont get ex
cited, though, just an idea of Dr. 
Porters to compensate the stu
dents for having worked so hard 
" I wonder if he was being sar
castic?
Without a doubt, though, this 
years Carnival will be the most 
authentic onedid you know we 
are going to have a ferris wheel 
and a merry-go-round on the cut? 
Well, at least thats what I heard. 
Oh, mushnow, wait a minute, 
let me finish. I was going- to tell 
you about the girls mushball 
game. All you effervescent, viva
cious girls with loads of pep 
should come out to play ball Sat
urday afternoon. After all, why 
should the boys monopolize the 
cut (notice the little c).
But lets get back to the be
ginning when Tommy Dorsey will 
start Carnival off with a bang on 
Thursday night. His imaginary 
gun will commence the race 
(pun) for a wonderful time was 
had by all.
Quakers Sponsor 
Work Projects 
For U. S. Youth
Since 1934 the American 
Friends Service Committee has 
conducted work camps for stu
dents in areas of tension and con
flict. The camps are located so 
that the members share in the 
life and problems of the commun
ity.
Each camp wiil be under the 
leadership of a married couple 
of trustworthy character. Many 
of the camps provide a local per
son as work foreman in charge 
of construction.
The camps will extend from 
June 27 to August 22, 1941. They 
will be located in the coal fields 
of Pennsylvania and West Vir
ginia, the rural rehabilitation 
projects of the South, the cooper
atives in New York and Michi
gan, and among the migratory 
workers of the Pacific coast.
Seventy-five dollars is the fee 
for two months of camp.
Stuart MacMackin, Field Sec
retary of the American Friends 
Society, was in Pittsburgh over 
the week-end and spoke at the 
freshman social relations assem
bly.
A Quaker himself, Mr. Mac 
Mackin is a graduate of Dart
mouth and holds a law degree 
from Cornell. He sees the need 
for training students who have 
encountered social and economic 
problems hitherto only in text
books, to meet these problems 
first hand.
Mr. Mac Mackin has the feeling 
that the best way to deal with 
poverty-stricken communities is 
not sweeping reforms, but indi
vidual help by little groups. 
Quakers feel that if everyone gets 
this social spirit, reforms will not 
be necessary.
Absolute quality of race and 
creed is a basic belief of all Quak
ers. Consequently, anyone is in
vited to apply. Applications must 
be sent in by May 20 to the fol

citizens not connected with the 
state government' who are on the 
eleven-man board.
Through the state council of 
the Defense Act the Governor is 
empowered in time of emergency 
to create, the Defense council. The 
function of the body will be to 
coordinate state and local activi
ties with the national defense 
program. Its powers are very far 
reaching; they include the super
vision and direction of investiga
tion; and the recommendation of 
legislation on appropriate action 
concerning industry labor, trans
portation, etc. In short the coun
cil is empowered to take any 
necessary action within the law.
The eleven men in the board 
will receive no compensation for 
their services, but $25,000 has 
been appropriated for operating 
expenses. The men serving on the 
council are the Governor, who 
will act' as chairman, the Lieuten
ant Governor, State Treasurer,
Auditor General, Secretary of In
ternal Affairs, Adjutant General,
Speaker of the House, President 
pro tem of the House and three 
citizens chosen by the Governor,

One, two, threebang! That 
marks the beginning of Scotch 
and Sodas new revue, Heres 
To You. Its the one big variety. 
show different from Techs pre
vious musicals in that it boasts 
a slight theme. It {ells of the trials 
of a swing orchestra and what 
happens to its members after 
theyve swung too much.
The skits, worthy of profes
sional recognition, move along in 
a fast tempo, and two and a half 
hours of solid entertainment are 
guaranteed with each ticket.
The songs in the revue are ter
rific and may win us the ASCAP 
competition award. This prize is 
awarded for the best musical 
production. Gloria Siegle, last 
years musical find, has many 
songs in the show, and Susie 
Miller has contributed her share.
194ls new composer, however, is 
Jerry Kurtz, whose numbers are 
nothing short of spectacular.
One of the big features of the 
production is that it will bring 
many new faces to the Carnegie 
Music Hall stage, especially 
freshmen who hereby assure the 
success of Techs future shows.
Heres To You will introduce 
Betty Ellen Morris, new singing 
sensation, Audrey Botkin, danc
ing star, and Gary Davis and 
Ernie Motyl, comedy finds.
The review was written by an 
associated group under the di
rection of Ruth Brodie, vivid 
stage personality.

Movies Today
Today at 11:30 in the Little 
Theatre, Tech students and 
friends will have a chance to see 
and hear the French sound film, 
Harvest, which won the first 
prize awarded by the Academy of 
Motion Pictures for the best for
eign film. There will be a second 
showing in Room 104, Industries,' 
at 8:15. There will be English 
sub-titles and admission will be 
free.
Liff, Roily Kraus, Marvin Einhorn, Bobby Challener and Mol
ly van Ameringen. Behind the 
scenes as usual are Eddie Berkovitz, A1 Blum, Bill Beg'gs and 
Bob Ferrenz.
A lot of thanks is also due A1 
Segal, director of both last years 
and this years shows, without 
whose help the revue could never 
have been a success. His dynamic 
personality has proven contag
ious and the whole cast has 
caught the breezy spirit so es
sential to a peppy show. (Inci
dentally A1 gave up a job in 
Trenton to come here.)
The Scotch and Soda club has 
now, as never before, achieved 
nationwide publicity with its 
news stories (especially with 
their picketing of the Harvard 
show). In fact it has been rum
ored that Life is coming down 
to cover the production.
The Club has been growing 
very rapidly and theres a pos
sibility in the very near future of 
taking the show on a -tour of the 
Tri-State area. All that is need
ed is the support of every stu
dent on campus.
To quote Biff Liff, president 
of S. & S.We want every stu
dent and department to feel that 
S. & S. is not a closed organiza
tion and that they all have some
thing to contribute to the 1942 
show. The future of the club de
pends on YOUR cooperation. Re

Technical Plans 
New Subscription 
Payment Basis
The Carnegie Technical, in 
making plans for its sixth year, is 
proposing to provide a paid sub
scription for each engineering day 
student to be covered by the pres
ent activities fee that is paid at 
registration. The Technical is 
familiar to most engineering stu
dents as a ready source of current 
engineering facts written for the 
average student. One of the fea
tures is the annual Tau Beta Pi 
issue, which is exclusively writ
ten by members of that society.
With this new plan, every en
gineer will be able to have each 
copy to read and keep for ref
erence. Subscriptions will still be 
available for night school students 
and others at the regular price.
Incovporated with this proposed 
plan is an arrangement whereby, 
with the cooperation of Mr. John 
D. Beatty, Head of the Employ
ment Bureau, copies of the 
Technical will be sent to com
panies interested in employing 
Tech graduates. Through this 
medium, students will have the 
opportunity to write articles that 
will carry weight with prospec
tive employers and show them 
the sort of work in which they 
are interested.
The plan is to be presented to 
Student Council for approval and 
for the necessary appropriation 
of eight hundred dollars, an in
crease of but three hundred over 
last years appropriation.
IC the plan is approved, The 
Technical will be able to put 
out a larger issue all next year, 
comparable to the large sixth is
sue of this year.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 29, 1941
Editor Aslts Many <Questions 
Of Council, A1 ministration
This in I lie Inst editorial In appear over the names of the old 
senior staff. There are many things to be said which have previ
ously been left out due to the pressure of events.
We have wondered for a long time why, since it is only fair 
to spare a large amount of our presidents time for his national 
defense duties, there is not an individual on campus left with 
the responsibility and courage to make necessary decisions with
out waste of time.
We have often wondered why members of the faculty, stu
dent council, and the administration never make (or voice it 
they have made) decisions without first seeing what someone 
higher up thinks. No matter how trivial the information sought, 
TARTAN reporters are often shuttled from one person to an
other and frequently go without a story simply because someone 
is afraid to release the information.
For some strange reason our administration is surrounded 
by an aura of almost oriental mystery. Apparently no one knows 
precisely what the policies of the administration or the Board of 
Trustees are, and few people seem to care.
We wonder, too, why the notion of "equality before the 
law has never met with particular recognition here. The TAR
TAN was the subject of furious administration criticism because 
it took sides in the ICaufmann strike. No one has remarked upon 
the fact that the Cut has taken sides in the strike at the West 
Penn Hospital. We have long given up I lie attempt to find prin
ciples in tile maze of contradictory policies.
We wish someone would once and for all resolve the muddled 
athletic situation. The alternatives seem rather clear: either we 
will subsidize athletics in a practical way or we will do without 
intercollegiate competition the way Chicago and M. I. T. do. It 
is about time that we bad a decision one way or another.
Who, outside of Student Council, is subsidizing the Cut? Why 
is the Carnival Committee paying for three issues of the Cut for 
Carnival without submitting the matter to Student Council?
Exactly what is the status of the Cut? And why couldnt the 
president of Student Council answer this question two weeks ago? 
Did Council approve the Cut or not? And what would such ap
proval imply? Why have TARTAN-owned typewriters which 
were not locked up in the TARTAN office Friday night found 
locked up in the Cut office on the following Wednesday? And 
why were there 233 extra calls on the TARTAN phone bill the. 
first month of the Cuts existence? If 1 he TARTAN and Student 
Council are subsidizing the Cut why isnt it distributed free of 
charge like the TARTAN?
Why Change Salary System?
A plan to substitute scholarships for salaries for work in 
student organizations will shortly come before Council. The plan 
is apparently designed to remove the cash stigma from the 
present system.
Certain serious drawbacks of the proposal are readily 
apparent:
1. No provisions are made for a student who already holds * 
a scholarship.
2. There is no reason for feeling guilty about paying sala
ries. Most schools do it. The change would simply make things 
less obvious and less convenient.
3. The present system of paying salaries monthly permits 
Council some means of enforcing its decisions. After the scholar
ship is paid.at the beginning of the year, incentive to work is 
likely to be weakened. The threat of cutting oil the salary is 
.eliminated.
4. Most students, whose tuition and fees arc already taken 
care of by their parents, would much rather receive a monthly 
chock for their work than have their tuition paid. In actual fact, 
it should make very little difference to Council in what form the 
money is paid. Why not, then, give it to the students in the forjn 
of a monthly check and let them spend it as they see fit.
5. The word scholarship is coming to mean anything and 
everything. Let scholarships be awarded to those with high 
factor and lot us keep the salary system where it now applies.
Tho most serious ill which the new plan would be likely to 
work would bo to discourage scholarships students from compet
ing in those activities which now offer a salary as a reward for 
effort. After all, if an incentive is to be effective, it must actually 
offer something to the student.
The scholarship plan leaves all the evils of the present system 
and then adds a few of its own. For the good of Techs extra
curricular life, wo hope Council will not pass it.

Ever since a girl in high school 
told him that he looked like Clark 
Gable, Harold Chang Dunn has 
been gathering laurels for ath
letic ability, wit, poetry composi
tion, pulchritude, and sartorial 
splendor.
Tarina, as he is affectionately 
called by close friends, is a genial, 
smiling, witty fellow with a yen 
for the better things in lifemu
sic, poetry, and women. Yes, that 
rough exterior conceals the soul 
of an artiste. Concerning his 
poems, however, modest Chang 
merely says, with typical depth of 
feeling, They come and they go.
Just recognition of Changs sar
torial splendor came when a 
downtown department store se
lected him as representative from 
Tech to model mens college 
clothes. Customers of the store 
were startled to find the picture 
of Harold Dunn, Carnegie Tech 
campus leader modeling snappy 
sport coats and sharp fifty-five 
cent ties. When asked upon what 
basis he was chosen, Changs sig
nificant reply was, It just hap
pened.
That oriental look about his 
eyes, incidentally, became re
sponsible for- Harolds nickname 
when he was a mere lad of ten. 
He has recently become a follower 
of classical music, and has dab
bled somewhat in singing, his 
main effort in this field being an 
unsuccessful attempt to make the 
Scobell Hall glee club when he 
was a resident of that dorm. I 
had a wrinkle in my throat, com
ments Chang sadly.
The half smoothie and half 
jit music of Tommy Dorsey wins 
Changs approval. When in the 
mood (accurately estimated at 
523/4% of the time) Chang jitter
bugs. As for heart interest, Chang 
admits there is a little girl in 
Squirrel Hill, an alumna of Pitt 
and Penn state, who occupies 
his time. Chang is a member of 
Beta Sigma Rho fraternity. His 
hobby is playing bridge, especially 
with Walt Pretzat. His favorite 
food is food with apple pie and 
ice cream for dessert. With all 
deference to his other friends on 
the faculty, Chang names Mr. 
Carroll his favorite instructor.
Two years ago he filled the role 
of Buckwheat in Scotch and 
Soda, acting in company of such 
noted thespians as Whitey Lee and 
Juice Friedlander.
Changs favorite sports are foot
ball, basketball, and tennis. His 
greatest sports thrill came in 
blocking a punt against Pitt last 
year in the Stadium. Techites will 
recall the play as the one that put 
Carnegie in possession of the ball 
on Pitts four-yard line.
Changs plans for the future are 
not definite as yet. He hopes to 
get a selling job in printing. He 
may also play pro football for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. Failing that, 
the Air Cox-ps and the Marines 
beckon. Whatever his final deci
sion may be, Techs students join 
in wishing success to a really 
grand fellow.

Letter to Editor 
Deplores Lack 
Of Kiltie Support
Thursday evening I had the 
pleasure of attending a splendid 
concert by the Kiltie Band in 
Carnegie Music* Hall.
To my amazement there were 
nearly as many people on the 
stage as there were sitting in the 
hall. It is difficult to understand 
why this fine. organization is not 
supported by the students.
The Kiltie Band in the last 
three years has become known 
all over the district for the fine 
concert programs which it gives 
at high schools and churches to 
enthusiastic audiences. Yet at 
Carnegie Tech only a handful of 
people turn out to hear them give 
their big concert.
When the Kiltie Band gave its 
first home concert the Tech fac
ulty presented a play on the same 
evening; last year the weather 
was bad enough to account for 
a poor house. Thursday night 
there was no excuseunless the 
Band just didnt push the ticket 
sale.
If the members of the band are 
too busy to sell tickets I suggest 
that they give a free concert and 
pass the hat.

?Gators Beat u 
Tech Netters
The Allegheny College nctmen 
threw the Tartan aggregation for 
a loss last Saturday. Although the 
singles matches broke, for an 
even up count, the 'Gators wedg
ed in a twosome in the doubles 
matches to give the Techmen 
their first defeat of the year,
Durker, 1-Iarwig, and Moses 
dropped three singles tilts to Al
leghenys McEwen, Caravacci, 
and Flint, placing Tech in the 
hole. However, Langford, Iierre, 
and Salsbury of Tech, dealt- the 
same medicine to Blank, Fauver, 
and McVey, of the Gator team, 
to even up the count and give the 
local boys a chance to cop the 
match Unfortunately, McEwen 
and Caravacci proved too for
midable a combination for the 
Tartan coalition, Durker and 
Herre, putting the boys from the 
park district a count .behijid. 
Moses and Kaplan came back for 
Tech and again evened the - tally 
by defeating Flint and Blank. The 
match, however, went to the boys 
from Allegheny, when Fauver 
and McVey outstepped Gibland 
and Harwig, 6-1 and 6-2.

CARNIVAL SPORTING EVENTS

Phi Kaps, Transfers Look Good
Today marks the beginning of the third week of Carnegies 
Intramural Softball competition. During the past seven days 
the progress-of the elimination series has been somewhat retard
ed by the untimely- appearance of old Joe Rain Cloud and all his 
droplets. However, according to all the latest reports from 
Marse Eyman, the participants are dashing down the home stretch 
in their respective leagues.
From personal observation I would say the Phi Kappa boys 
are the class of the fraternity group, and from all appearances 
seem destined to end up in the .top position in their league. This 
squad boasts of a better-than-average pitcher in big Ted Pruger, 
and the infield is bolstered by the presence of Griffin and Hen
nessey." The outfield is patrolled by Bill Minkel, Mike Saska, and 
Ed Culley, who are far superior to the average run of fielding 
talent. In the other fraternity league; the Kappa Sigs seem to 
be meeting all opposition, and are now resting in first place by 
virtue of their record of three wins and no defeats. The Clyde 
Streeters big test comes tomorrow when they meet the Delts in 
a game that promises to be a battle royal.
In the Independent circuit, the members of the Transfer 
Club seem to have a virtual monopoly on first honors. From what 
I have seen of their playing ability they have all the earmarks of 
a prize winning aggregation. They have several good pitchers, 
all the members of the club can swat the ball, and their fielding 
ability is good enough to give their pitchers excellent support. 
In the other league the Citcom Clan has come out on top, but_ 
should do nothing more than offer a good practice session for the 
Transfer boys.
Looking over the teams entered in the competition, and judg
ing from what has been said and what I have seen, it seems to 
me that the Transfer Club is slated to win this years school 
softball championship.
Last Column of Year
Its hard to believe that an entire school year has rolled 
around, and that the time has come for a new Sports Editor to 
take up my position. However, before I leave I should like to 
thank Buddy Overend, Mr. Frank Eyman, Max Iiannum, and 
Dr. Eddie Baker for the help they have given me in carrying out 
my job as a news reporter.
Without further noise on my part I turn you over to Joe 
Thomas, who will serve as Sports Editor during the coming year.
Pictured above are the mem
bers of the Tech Freshman Rifle 
team, who are coached by Ser
geant Sommers. Although not exceptional marksmen, these boys 
promise to measure up to the 
standards set by former teams 
coached, by Sergeant Sommers.

. Carnegie Techs varsity golf 
squad opened its campaign last 
Wednesday against Geneva Col
lege with a neat 6-3 victory.
Ward Duchene and Al Gubey, 
playing in the one and two posi
tions for Tech, lost their individ
ual matches and best ball by close 
scores to give the visitors a 3-0 
lead. However, Chuck Klimas and 
George Tondorf, Tartan three and 
four men, took their opponents 
over to the tune of 5 and 4, and 
4 and 3 respectively, . and won 
best ball by a 6 and 4 count to 
knot the tally at three all. The 
Skibo five and six men, Harry 
Sacks and Captain Jack Ellen, 
mowed down their Geneva foes 
without much trouble, netting /the 
Plaid three more points and giv
ing the Scots a 6-3 triumph.
On Friday the Tartan Frosh 
linksmen bowed to a fine Shadyside Academy team, 13-2. The 
Plebe squad composed of 
Schwartz, Gibson, Henke, Ander
son, . and Nierenberg found the 
the experienced play of the 
Shadysiders a little too much for 
them!
Trackmen Win 
Opening Meet 
Of 41 Season
Techs cindermen opened their 
season last Saturday in the Tech 
Bowl with a double victory, the 
varsity winning over Indiana 
State Teachers and the Plebes 
over Schenley High. Both meets 
were heavily one-sided on Techs 
side of the ledger with the score 
of the varsity meet coming to a 
grand total of 93-33, and the 
freshman score to 86-23.
The Plaid varsity took all three 
scoring places in the -one mile, 
two mile, the 440 dash, and the 
high jump. The low hurdles, half 
mile, javelin throw, broad jump, 
and shot put events added to the 
Tartans glory in the summaries. 
Paul I-Iaupt and Pete Sarantopolous did more than their bits for 
the squad by taking two victories 
in their events.
Burstynowicz, P r i t c h a r d, 
Whiteside, Cantinni, Vollbrecht, 
and Phillipchek starred for the 
freshmen. Vollbrecht'was the sur
prise of the meet, doing the 
quarter mile in faster time than 
I-laupt of the varsity. Coach Guy 
Halferty has great hopes for Voll
brecht for the varsity next year.

Final Dance
Council Selects 
Clyde Knights Band
The gymnasium will' be the 
scene of. the final Evening Stu
dent Council dance of the cur
rent school year. Social Chair
man Lou Fosner, has acquired 
the sweet dance music of Clyde 
Knight and his -band. Clyde and 
his Dance With Delight to Music 
Thats Right band are well 
known to those who have at
tended our dances for the past 
several years. Clyde has become 
one of Pittsburgh's leading band 
leaders, and his long engagement 
at Bill Greens shows his fast 
growing popularity. The band 
features the vocals of Janet Lee, 
I-Ierbert Rohrer, and Clyde him
self.
Those attending the affair will 
dance between the spotted reflec
tions of our much publicized 
crystal ball and the gay lights 
casting weird shadows upon the 
floor. Color itself will predomin
ate as the theme of the dance. 
With the spring flowers in full 
bloom, our lovely corsages will 
adorn the fair ones with a touch 
of spring to match .the light in 
their eyes.
Dancing will begin at nine 
oclock and as necessary will end 
at midnight. Admission can be 
obtained for the small sum of one 
dollar per couple.
The council dance will be the 
last opportunity for insignia 
award workers to earn credits 
necessary for their keys.
Insignia Points 
May Be Obtained 
At Final Events
As the school year approaches 
an end you had better stop and 
thinkDo you have enough 
points for an insignia award? 
You still have a chance to earn 
some. The Engineers Banquet 
has opened two ways for earning 
points: helping this Saturday af
ternoon at 2 P. M., in the Mirror 
Room of the Schenley Hotel, and 
selling tickets. This is the last op
portunity for Engineers to obtain 
points from that. college.
Student Council Dance supplies 
three periods at which you may 
earn three points each instead of 
the usual two points per period. 
You may decorate in the after
noon before the dance; work in 
the check room, pass out corsages 
in the evening; and help clean 
up Sunday afternoon.
The Plaid is your last chance 
to .secure these precious points. 
Come up t,o the Union Friday 
evening at 8:00, walk in the front 
door, up the stairs, when you 
see some industrious peopleit is 
the Stall'. The Plaid can always 
use writers and typists.

valuable door prizes. Another fea

Great spirit and enthusiasm

music. We are grateful for this 
opportunity to thank the com
mittee members for their good 
work and to show our apprecia
