CIT Basketball Team 
Downs Allegheny; 
Surrenders To Case
Maxie and his Tartans proved to 
be rude hosts last Wednesday when 
they slapped down the unsuspecting 
Allegheny Alligators 59-37. This 
farewell performance of Leo 
Clougherty and Mike Theodore 
turned out to be one of the most en
joyable sessions the team has spent 
this season. The Plaid took an early 
lead on Theodores first basket and 
was never headed. Shortly after 
this Theodore left the game with a 
slight ankle injury but soon return
ed to action. As it turned out later, 
the two boys in their swan role put 
in 29 points for our side, a substan
tial chunk of the total. Tasso Katselas found the range for six field 
goals, and Mel Klein broke his 
slump +o put in an equal number.
The battle went slightly in our 
favor in the first quarter. This stan
za ended with the score in our favor 
14-10, and by further subduing 
the Gators, we made it 28-10 at the 
half. Here Doc Jones took over to 
present'Mike and Leo with their let
ters for the season, and the game 
started again. It was just a down
hill coast from there in. Maxie 
worked slightly on his future start
ing lineup, and a merry time was 
had by all.
Principal thorn in the side was a 
boy named Fhrer. He did most of 
the Allegheny scoring with a total 
of fourteen points, and was all over 
the floor.

Cditosili A'unoluU'iLetter To The Editor
Welcome Frosh
In behalf of the whole student body we welcome you to Carnegie Tech. 
We sincerely hope that you will be happy and successful here  in fact, 
wed like to give you a few words of advice that we think might help. We 
know, of course, that you have been given many unsought words of wis
dom by all who knew that you were entering college, but we think that 
we can add something different to that same old story.
The most important thing a freshman can bring to college with him 
is an objective point of view. Think things out for yourself. Decide exactly 
what is the most important thing you want to get from your three or four 
years at Carnegie Tech, and then set out to accomplish your aim. For 
some people this is easy  they are the ones who are seriously interested 
in some profession, and they neednt be told to buckle down and work while 
in school, because they know thats what they are here for. For the rest, 
the choice is not so easy. They may just be marking time before coming 
to a decision about their lifes work, or until they are eighteen, or until they 
get married. It is for these people that we say it is important to think about 
what they really want most in school. Its foolish as well as nearly impos
sible for an individual to go out for five or six activities, become a bright 
light in the social world, and try to make high grades at the same time.
There are many intramural sports to choose from, many publications 
to work on, lots of other things like the Glee Club or the YMCA that can 
be fun to belong to, but dont try them all at the same time.. Of course, 
we dont mean for you to be too narrow in your choice of activities at Tech, 
for we think that your life should have variety, but we would like to warn 
you against taking on too many things at first. We want you to join in 
activities, but we think you should look over the various forms of activity 
carefully before you decide which one or two you want to work on. And 
then really work at it  much of the value of a college is that its extra
curricular work is good training in how to get along with people, and how 
to handle responsibilities.
Think it over, frosh, and more power to you.
Letter to the Editor
Dear Editor And To Whom It 
May Concern:
During my three years at Tech I 
have had my attention rudely at
tracted to one of the quirks in 
human nature. The situation is in
variably the same: The lunch bell 
sounds in every building on the 
campus and hungry students come 
pouring out of classes with the in
tention of getting lunch in the Grill 
as soon as possible. Quickly a line 
of considerable length forms at the 
entrance to the food counter. Then 
it happensone of the girls walks 
down the stairs, reaches the bottom, 
and stops, overcome by the length 
of the line. Aha, but that doesnt stop 
her. Looking around with deter
mination expressed in every fea
ture, she follows one of two courses. 
Seeing Janie way down in front, she 
emits a little scream and rushes to
ward her objective with Oh! Janie! 
How was the history exam this 
morning? Meanwhile she inserts 
herself about two places removed 
from the tray stack. Objective taken 
amid the curses mumbled by the 
people who had the courtesy and 
respect for their fellows to take 
their places at the end of the line.
Or else she follows another pro
cedure: Seeing something or some
one near the food counter, she quiet
ly moves closer for further inves
tigation. Then bingo! It happens. 
She simply sidesteps into the head 
of the line while someones attention 
is momentarily attracted elsewhere. 
And so it goes. By the time one 
reaches the point where it is possi
ble to see lunch, this process has oc
curred at least three times.
And so to you who are guilty, may 
I point out a few things. Under the 
leadership of Susan B. Anthony, 
women gained political suffrage. 
During the first world war they 
gained economic equality. But some 
of you still believe that insofar as 
common everyday dealings in the 
economic world are concerned, it is 
still permissible to use the tactics of 
a mid-Victorian belle. When are you 
going to realize that concomitant 
with freedom is responsibility, that 
equality of the sexes implies the 
same fair modes of conduct by 
either sex? Or maybe you never will 
courteously start at the end of the 
line and await your turn.
Respectfully,
Mike Riggle.

Dear Editor,
As Commander of the Tecvets 
and a member of the senior class in 
the Engineering school, I wish to 
voice my opinions regarding the 
subject of student activities and rep
resentation on council. The present 
constitution, as you indicated in 
your editorial of last week, with its 
numerous loopholes, poor phrasing 
and ambiguities, needs, should I say 
demands, revision. I believe it 
would be more advantageous to the 
student body if the present form be 
completely discarded and an entire
ly new form of student government 
and charter be installed. My reasons 
for proposing and entirely new con
stitution are numerous and I shall 
attempt to specify them as well as 
my suggestions for a new constitu
tion.
Primarily I believe that student 
council needs and must have the 
power to promote and execute such 
affairs as are necessary to supple
ment the regular activities and to in
sure a well balanced social program. 
Under the present set up, A.C.A.C. 
is merely the rubber stamp repre
sentative which approves or disap
proves of the various activities as 
proposed by school organizations. 
Any group which desires to sponsor 
an all-school affair submits its 
budget oi; expenses together with 
an account of the dispersement of 
profits (if any) to council. The lack 
of cooperation between the various 
organizations and schools has caus
ed the last two dances to be financial 
if not social failures. Since individuual organizations are not allowed
to spend any profits accumulated 
from affairs, the initiative for pro
moting a really successful affair is 
destroyed. No one organization con
sidering present day enrollments 
and membership is in a position to 
sponsor an undertaking such as 
Spring Carnival, for example. How
ever active, a truly representative 
council could insure the success of 
such an undertaking.
Thus my second argument is that 
council must have a more selective 
representation of the student body. 
At present the engineering school 
has three representatives yet one of 
these handles the affairs of publica
tions while the other represents 
athletics. I believe that when it 
comes to putting over a dance it is 
the engineering school that makes 
or breaks the affairs. In general, 
boys still have to do the dating. At 
present there are five campus or
ganizations that control the school 
indirectly, yet have no direct voice 
in student government. These 
groups are Interfraternity Council, 
Panhellenic Council, Interhonorary 
Council, and two new organizations 
with unlimited potentialities, name
ly, Citcom Clan, and the Tecvets.
Not being a member of Citcom, I 
can only state at this time, that the 
majority of students are commut
ers. In the past Citcom threatened 
to overpower the then dictatorial 
Interfraternity Council. The com
muters do represent a decided num
ber of the total enrollment and 
should have the vote they deserve as 
such. As Commander of the Tecvets,

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
p & D Student Views 
pepsi-Cola Exhibit, 
portraits of America
Two associates of Carnegie Tech 
are represented in the art exhibit 
sponsored by Pepsi-Cola which 
opened at the Carnegie Institute 
February 1 and will continue 
through March 4. The exhibit is en
titled Portrait of America. Its pur
pose is to bring the artist and in
dustry closer together and to prove 
that there is a definite association 
between them. This exhibit is the 
first attempt of its kind which has 
crystalized and caught the publics 
eye. It is definitely a step in the 
right direction, but it is not wholly 
successful because it is prejudicing 
the public against art by eliminating 
abstracts from the show. Out of one 
hundred and fifty paintings in the 
exhibit, the Pepsi-Cola company has 
selected twelve prize winning paint
ings which have been reproduced in 
color for the Pepsi-Cola calendar for 
1945. Not one of the twelve paint
ings is abstract. Here the company 
is making a big mistake. It is true 
that the general public turns their 
back on abstracts because they do 
not understand them. But, this idea 
must be altered because abstracts 
are the essence of modern art and 
will be seen more and more within 
the next ten years.
Five thousand artists submitted 
paintings which were judged by the 
Artists for Victory Incorporated. 
Among the small number selected 
were Tech Belle by Clarence H. 
Carter and The Little People by 
Richard E. Williams. Mr. Carter is 
a former member of the faculty in 
the Painting and Design depart
ment. His painting reveals his at
titude toward the Tech lass. It is 
full of subtle sarcasm. Richard Wil
liams was recently graduated from 
Techs sculpture department. The 
Little People is not dependent on 
color to relate his idea. It has depth 
and a definite mood.
As compared with the Paintings 
in the United States exhibit which 
was shown throughout December, 
Portrait of America is inferior.
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 
At Outlines February 11
Outlines, the modern art gallery 
of Pittsburgh, has announced as its 
program this Sunday the showing 
of the famous and highly controver
sial experimental, expressionistic 
horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Cali
gari. Two showings will be present

Tech students should be the pro
gram scheduled for Sunday, Febru
ary 18 when Dr. Charles Niemeyer, 
member of the drama faculty and a 
former member of the original New 
Theater Group will present a oneman production of the musical, The 
Cradle Will Rock. The performance 
will begin at 8:30 p. m.
Students may attend the weekly 
programs at Outlines by subscribing

Navy V-12ers at Georgia Tech 
Write About C.I.T. Glamour Girls
Just to show how far reaching 
the various editions of the Tartan 
are, here is a letter written to Car
roll Henson. It is from a member of 
the Navy V-12 program who is sta
tioned at Georgia Tech.
Hi, Neighbor,
Glad to see you, as Phil Silvers
me within my bounds so that I may 
repay my obligations of gratitude to 
you. For a woman of your excep
tional talents that task shouldnt be 
difficult at all.
No. 2 is pointing toward a girl that 
my roommate has taken a liking to. 
I am sure that George Washington
These Are the Gals Who Are So Much in Demand at Georgia Tech.
might say on his night off. As any 
fool can easily see I got your paper. 
I really think a lot more could be 
said about your school paper than 
ours. It, at least, does not confine its 
information to gossip. The Techni
que usually has only one picture of 
females in it while yours has many. 
Since women are the most import
ant things in life it follows that our 
school paper leaves out the most 
important things.
I hope that I am not being too 
forward, nor too hasty, when I pre
sent my small request. You will 
find, on the clipping I am sending 
back to you, two arrows. No. 1 is 
pointing toward a skirt that yours 
truly would like to meet on a desert
ed mountain. You would do me an 
injustice not to send me her name 
and address. In return for your 
troubles you may ask anything of
Taylor Christman Jr., my honorable 
roommate, would appreciate any 
help you might render toward sup
plying him with the ladys name and 
address.
We hope you dont mistake our 
requests to mean that we have any 
malicious intent of forthought con
cerning the young ladies. Nor are 
we lonesome to the extent that we 
would accept any chance to lessen 
distress. We are merely interested 
in broadening our education. Get 
what I mean?
Your sailor,
Sin-bad 
In answer to the request in the 
letter, here are the addresses of the 
two girls in the picture:
No. 1: Phyllis Grant, 5632 Marl
boro Rd., Pittsburgh 17, Pa.
No. 2: June Reilly, 51 North Jack

Our Humble Opinion
For last Friday nights presenta
tion of Alls Well That Ends Well, 
the second cast deserves laurels. 
Most of the acting was lively, con
vincing, and well interpreted. Rita 
Sheinman as the Countess did an 
excellent job, equalling that done 
by Prissy Dodge. Especially good 
was the portrayal of the mothers 
anger and shame towards her sons 
behavior. In her role as Bertram, 
Joan Bower was not quite so suc
cessful as Pat Turton. Her mascu
line attitude and mannerism were 
commendable but her acting was in
consistent. The emotional parts 
seemed overdone; however she jus
tified those occasional failures with 
a swell job in the last scene where 
she really caught the spirit of her 
role. As one who caught the spirit 
of the part and interpreted it with 
feeling, Pat Walker as Helena 
should most definitely be mention
ed. Her monologues were rich and 
beautifully spoken as Shakespeare
most certainly meant them to be.
The First and Second Lords 
Dumain as portrayed by Marcia 
Wachter and Gerry Gedd, were 
good enough as secondary charac
ters but seemed to lack vitality. As 
men they were generally convinc
ing. One of the girls who seemed 
more successful in a male role was 
Rosa Ellovich, as Rinaldo. Perhaps 
a good make-up job was partly re
sponsible for this success. Gloria 
Goldsmith, Marilyn Bloom, Lucy 
Siebert, and Ruth Guberman, who 
played minor roles, were lively, en
tertaining, and natural. It is unnec
essary to mention Ray Boyle, Clark 
Marlor and Jack Hochhauser who 
were regular members of both 
casts. They did a great job. As a 
whole the acting and the entire in
terpretation of the play were above 
the level of most of the departments 
recent presentations. The actors 
seemed to enjoy themselves and so 
did the audience.
Panhellenie Council 
Holds a Sing Bridge 
In Canteen, Feb. 9
Panhellenie Council is sponsoring 
a Sing Bridge to be held Friday 
evening, February 9 at the Can
teen. This will be the first inter
sorority event of the semester.
Lenore DeWall, president of PanHell has announced that all the 
sororities are cooperating to make 
this party a big success. Bridge, 
(Hearts, too) songs, and food will 
be plentiful. Prizes are to be award
ed the bridge champs, but the sing
ers can expect nothing more than 
spirited laurels.
Since the usual Greek Sing and 
Swing has been omitted from the 
social calendar this year, the girls 
are taking this opportunity to keep 
the fraternity spirit alive.
The Canteen...
By Audrey Wilkins
One day last week I stopped in at 
the Canteen between my 9 and 10 
oclock classes for just one hand of 
bridge, following my usual custom. 
I noticed especially one foursome, 
three sprawling, plaid-shirted engi
neers (I suppose that they were en
gineers because they were tan gents 
an unmistakable sine) and an ex
ceptionally meek Maggie Murph 
freshman. The men were casually 
smoking Chesterfields (?) and drink
ing cokes. The girl was concentrat
ing all her effort on learning the in
tricacies of bridge. Im afraid I 
dont know how to play very well. 
How do you finesse?
When I dropped in at the Canteen 
between my 10 and 11 oclock classes 
for just one hand, they were still 
there. The engineers were carelessly 
smoking Rameses and drinking 
cokes. The meek Maggie Murph was 
trying hard to follow the game. Im 
afraid I dont quite understand yet. 
Is it all right to lead an ace?
On the way to my 12 oclock class, 
I stopped at the Canteen for just 
one hand and noticed that my little 
friends were still playing. The engi
neers were smoking pipes and 
drinking cokes. The meek freshman 
was still struggling. Im afraid I 
cant play very well. Which are 
higher, clubs or spades?
After lunch I discovered that I 
had enough time to dash up to the 
Canteen for just one hand. The 
three engineers were smoking cigar
ette butts and drinking cokes. The 
meek Maggie Murph murmured 
apologetically over the piles of 
empty cups, Im afraid I dont 
know much about bridge. Which is 
higher, a king or a queen?
After my three-hour chemistry 
lab I dragged myself up to the Can
teen for a little bit of recreation, 
such as a hand of bridge. My friends 
were still there, looking slightly 
haggard and tense. The engineers 
were drinking cokes. They were be
ginning to be noticeably impatient 
with their companion. She muttered 
hoarsely, Im afraid I dont know 
how to play very well. Is this little 
four-cornered red thing a club or a 
spade? With one accord the three 
men jumped to their feet, grabbed 
the girl, and beat her head against 
the wall so many times and with 
such violence that the pin-ball ma
chines registered TILT. I slipped out 
without saying a word. I didnt 
blame them.

Gradually you will begin to con

spends four days each week on 
Techs campus running about to &

water color (a course for archi

her painting technique, Spanish be
cause of her desire to visit Latin 
America after the war, sculpture 
because of* her keen interest in all 
arts and crafts, and French because 
she likes it (and because she need

her schedule!) Every Friday Louise 
goes to Deshon Hospital to do work 
in occupational therapy interesting 
and instructing partially disabled 
veterans of this war in arts 
and crafts. Her work is helpful in 
keeping the boys busy while they 
are recuperating and in developing 
in them the confidence that they can 
do beautiful and useful creative 
work. Through her association with 
many veterans she has learned what

The longer you talk to Louise, the 
more conscious you will become 
that there is practically nothing in 
which she is not interested and ac

Alpha Epsilon Phi, and has just 
completed her years term of of

She was on the TARTAN staff for 
three years and sang in the 
Womens Glee Club for two years. 
She loves music and the theatre, 
food, Bing Crosby, technicolor mus
ical comedies (possibly because her 
first three years at Tech were spent 
in the Costume Ec. department),, 
mystery stories, well-written histor
ical novels, stores of B-24s (she rec
ommends Valley of the Sky) and 
Rum and Coca Cola. In her spare 
time, which in spite of your unbe

like to write letters, visit Gils par

6TH! CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1945The Plaid
Arlene McMurray In 
Social Chairman Post
One of the casualties of the pres
ent semester is the loss to the Coun
cil of Mitzie Kitchen. Because of unforseen circumstances Mitzie was 
forced to discontinue classes for the 
remainder of the year. Thus the 
Council has been deprived of her 
services as Social Chairman.
Stepping into the vacated office is 
Arlene McMurray, who has been se
lected to carry on for the remaind
er of the semester. Arlene is well 
equipped to fill the office and we are 
promised a very successful term.
The first function under consid
eration is the Valentine Party 
which is to be held sometime in Feb
ruary. While this function is listed 
in the Social Calendar for February 
10, the date has of necessity been 
changed to a later one. The next is
sue of the Plaid will give more de
tails concerning the party.

This magazine not only welcomes

Incidentally, the subscription rate

It was my experience to be asked 
to walk across the Cut a few nights 
ago and my embarrassment was 
acute when my ignorance was re
vealed. I did not know where the 
Cut was!
A long hollow and a high hill 
stretched across the Carnegie Tech 
campus in years past and occasion
ed many weary hikes by way of 
Margaret Morrison Street to reach 
the Forbes Street trolleys. This con
dition was remedied by grading the 
hill and filling in the hollow; thus 
making the short Cut across the 
campus to Forbes Street and Morewood Avenue. The football field and 
the tennis courts are evidence of 
the former depth of the hollow.
The Cut was a huge undertaking, 
but its worth has been realized 
many times by the convenience it 
affords the students.

Poor me! The 8 ball editor failed 
to come out tonight and I have 
elected to take over. Here are a few 
items gathered from here and there 
. . . The fellows in the Calculus 
Class could hardly get along with
out the little blond gal, who seems 
to know all the answers (calculus 
answers, of course). Her work is the 
means by which they prove their 
homework. The only difficulty is 
when they ask her how she did the 
problems, she says she doesnt know. 
The boys probably say Well thats 
a woman for you . . . George Werber will certainly find himself be
hind the well-known 8-ball if his 
two girls (each of whom thinks she 
is his one and only) learn of each 
others existence. Oh well, there's 
safety in numbers, George . . . 
Leah Van Horn of the English 109 
Class has joined the Plaid staff. If 
Betty Ashcroft, who recently wrote 
a letter to the Plaid Editor, will 
come up on Friday night to the pat
tern Ship, Room 232, Industries 
Hall, the staff will gladly put her to 
work. Well expect you, Betty. . . . 
The fellows on the various commit
tees for the Engineers Banquet are 
certainly busy these days. (This is 
a Plug) . . . We wonder why 
Mary DeMaria came to the 6:30 
Voice and Speech Class instead of 
her usual 8:30 class. She gave the 
excuse that she was on the campus 
and thought she might as well at
tend the early class. Could be she 
had a date. Did Joe Rymar or did he 
not fall asleep in the class the other 
night? It is reported that he fell off 
the stool in E. E. Minor. Joe claims 
the stool slipped, but Harold Parks 
claims he was asleep. You need 
eight hours, Joe. . . . Miss Nancy 
Lewis who promised to write for 
the Plaid a travelogue of her trip 
to Panama has failed to do so. You 
write it, Nancy, well print it.
Engineers Banquet News
Yes, another week has slipped by, 
bringing us closer to April 7, 1945, 
the evening of the Thirtieth Annual 
Engineers Banquet.
Peg Lanagans theatrical agency 
has been chosen to provide enter
tainment for the affair, meaning 
that plans for the banquet are off 
to a flying start. Fellows, the Plaid 
intends to keep you posted on all of 
the new developments pertaining to 
the affair, for we know that the 
more you read about the banquet, 
the more you can tell your friends 
about it. In this way we can all 
help to make the Thirtieth Annual 
Banquet the best one yet.
Workers Are Needed
Those students interested in Plaid 
work should get in touch with editor 
Joe Rymar or report to room 232 in 
the Industries building on Friday 
evenings.
Basketball...
Continued from page 1
The mystery about last Saturday 
nights fracas is this: Just why the 
Clevelanders considered their 57-37 
victory such an upset. Perhaps they 
hadnt heard of our recent amputa
tion, or maybe it was just the relief 
of winning a game after eleven 
straight losses, but the game was re
ferred to as one of the greatest up
sets of the collegiate basketball sea
son. No one down here expected 
the Tartans to show anything, and 
they came through admirably.
Max sent Tasso Katselas and 
Tami Morinello out as forwards,- 
shifted Mel Klein to center, and 
started Oreste Scioscia and Fastuca 
at guards. This combination had 
trouble doing any damage, and 
watched Case take a 17-4 lead in 
the first quarter. The second quar
ter was almost as bad, and Case led 
at the half by 32-11. Up to this point 
Klein and Katselas had had two 
fielders apiece, and foul shots made 
up the rest of our unimposing total. 
By this time the game was pretty 
well lost, so Max used the bench for 
part of the final half, as did Coach 
Jeff Carlin of Case.
Leading the attack for Case were 
Jim Ziska and Tom Jenike, who had 
fifteen and thirteen points respec
tively. Mel Klein, now a center, had 
thirteen of Techs points, and Tasso 
contributed ten.
Its like starting the whole sea
son over for the team. After build
ing a rapidly improving outfit about 
Theodore and Clougherty, Max will 
have to start all over with the boys 
left. Naturally, the outlook is dark, 
but games left with Slippery Rock, 
Juniata, and Allegheny give us 
hope. Suicide contests with West
minister, Geneva, Penn State, and 
West Virginia will be pretty rough 
going, but as long as there are five 
men left to fill the uniforms Tech 
will be in there battling.

Continued from page 2 
I am in a position to state that the 
veterans on campus deserve and de
mand a voice in the affairs of stu
dent government. Being a group of 
relatively older students matured 
by army camps, troop ships, and 
battle stations, we have a slightly 
different viewpoint on campus. We 
are at Tech primarily for an educa
tion which we interrupted to serve 
our country, but we also want to do 
our rightful share in promoting 
campus activity. In another year the 
Tecvets estimate a membership well 
over one hundred. If the constitu
tion is to be revised this year we 
wish to be included in the new ver
sion so that our representative can 
voice the opinions of his fellow vet
erans and can vote on the affairs 
that concern the veterans as active 
members of the student body.
Finally, I submit this suggestion 
to the revisors or writers of the new 
student charter. I suggest that the 
following organizations be allowed 
one voting member each. Interfra
ternity Council, Panhellenic Coun
cil, Interhonorary Council, Tecvets, 
Citcom Clan, and Publications. 
These representatives are to be se
lected by the individual societies 
and not subject to a popular vote. In 
addition, Engineering shall have 
two elected representatives, Mar
garet Morrison, two, and Fine Arts, 
two. All told, this allotment of mem
bers on council provides eleven vot
ing members. The six elected mem
bers thus have a plurality of one 
vote over the appointed representa
tives. Also this new council should 
have the authority and the initiative 
to establish a social program of ac
tivities which .will be suitable for 
the student body.
By such a system I believe that 
the student activities will again be 
what they were in previous times.
