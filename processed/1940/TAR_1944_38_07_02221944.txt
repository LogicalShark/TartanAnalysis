War Department 
Curtails ASTP
The War Department, on Friday 
of last week, issued the statement 
that there would be a drastic cur
tailment of the Armys collegetraining program. This action fol
lowed other reports from the War 
Department to the effect that the 
combat strength of the Army was 
some 200,000 below the planned to
tal.
There has been no official an
nouncement as to the precise types 
of training which would be con
tinued. Indication was made, how
ever, that advanced courses in medi
cine, dentistry, and engineering 
would be maintained. Those sol
diers who are taking basic AST' 
courses would be the ones most af
fected by any such action.
The pursuance of this policy 
would mean the elimination of a 
number of soldier-students at Tech, 
all of whom are studying Basic En
gineering. It would mean, also, the 
retention of a somewhat smaller 
number of advanced engineering 
students. The most doubtful status 
in the entire affair is that of the for
eign area and language students. 
All reports from Washington have 
side-stepped the possible future 
position of these students.
If the pronouncement from the 
War Department is confirmed by of
ficial notification, approximately 
35,000 men will remain in ASTP. 
Attention is called, however, to the 
fact that, as yet no word from 
Washington has been received by 
the authorities at Tech or any other 
college.
Cwens Hold Annual 
Dance Saturday Night
We guarantee that its going to 
be one of the biggest social events 
of the season, so come on out. With 
this enthusiastic invitation from 
Jean Norris, Social Chairman of the 
affair, the Cwens invite you to the 
Soph Hop to be given on Satur
day, February 26, from nine to one 
in Exhibition Hall.
Already an established event on 
campus, the semi-formal dance is an 
annual affair sponsored by the girls 
sophomore honorary.
Tickets are $2.20 per couple and 
may be bought from any of the 
Cwens who can easily be recogniz
ed because of their red and gray 
costumes. Billy LeRoys orchestra 
will provide their usual sweet and 
smooth renditions of popular num
bers.
All students and ASTs are urged 
to attend and make it a long re
membered affair. Though Tuesday 
will be the official day to buy 
your tickets from the girls in red 
and grey they can be obtained from 
Cwens any time during this week. 
In order to accommodate last min
ute arrivals, tickets will be on sale 
at the entrance to Exihibition Hall 
Saturday evening.
Carnegie President 
Flooded By Awards
D?uring the past few weeks, Pres
ident Robert E. Doherty has been 
very much in the  news. He has 
been made an honorary member of 
the Engineering Institute of Can
ada; he was appointed to the Board 
of Visitors to the U. S. Naval Acad
emy; he won first prize in the Ex
hibit- of the Associated Artists of 
Pittsburgh for his self-portrait.
To Guys With A Gripe
This is directed to any GIs on 
the campus who have gripes or 
worse. If you want to say some
thing about things as they are 
around here, whether good or 
bad, drop around to Room 232 IH 
this coming Friday night after 
chow. This room is the office of 
the Tartan. We want news, opin
ions, features, anything at all. If 
you can writeall well and good. 
If notthen come up and say it. 
What we want most are items on 
the guys in your section.
The Army hasnt said very 
much since theyve been here, 
and its about time they stuck up 
for themselves. The Army side of 
this paper is numerically small, 
and it needs a lot of help. If you 
want to join, good; if not, then 
just leave an item about some of 
the guys you know, and what 
theyre doing. We want the pa
per to have a little more G. I. 
taste.
Its high time the Army had a 
little more say around here.

Come To Chapel Today! 
Support Religious Discussions
The United Nations, in drawing up the Four Freedoms last year, 
said of religion, That part of man which is called the spirit and which 
belongs only to himself and to his God, is of the very first concern in de
signing a free world.
With this view in mind Carnegie Tech opens its fifth annual Religious 
Discussion Week under the chairmanship of Dr. H. L. Lang today at 11:00. 
At this time, in a Chapel program, both students and faculty members will 
have an opportunity to hear representatives from the Jewish, the Cath
olic, and the Protestant faiths. Discussing the common topic, Facing the 
Future Unafraid, Rabbi Charles B. Lesser of the Rodef Shalom Temple, 
Father Francis X. Foley of Mount Mercy Academy and Reverend John 
Smith of the Third Presbyterian Church will each speak for fifteen minutes. 
------------------------------------------------------- Following their addresses, there
Guest Speakers of 
Religious Discussions 
Lead Colorful Lives
This week Dr. Dohertys merits in 
citizenship were recognized by the 
Junior Chamber of Commerce of 
Pittsburgh. The Man of the Year 
award for 1943 was presented to him 
on Tuesday, February 15 at the Ho
tel Pittsburgher. The purpose of 
the Junior Chamber of Commerce 
in making this award is to grant 
public recognition to that Pitts
burgher who activities have, in the 
opinion of the Board of Judges, 
made him Pittsburghs outstanding 
citizen for the year. President 
Doherty was on the nomination 
continued on page 3
Because this mornings chapel 
will only serve as a brief introduc
tion to the three main speakers, the 
Tartan staff probed into their varied 
careers in order to bring the stu
dents some interesting highlights on 
the local clergymen.
Undoubtedly holding the spot
light because of his unusual experi
ences is Reverend John Smith, who 
served in Japan for 13 years as a 
missionary under the Presbyterian 
Board of Foreign Missions. A grad
uate of Muskingham College and 
the Pittsburgh Seminary, Reverend 
Smith did rural and student evangelistical work before he was in
terned at Yokahama at the outbreak 
of the war.
Less spectacular, but none the 
less interesting careers are claimed 
by the other two speakers. As a 
graduate of Duquesne and Saint 
Vincents Theological Seminary in 
Latrobe, Father Foley has taught 
Psychology, Mental Hygiene, and 
Ethics at many of the Pittsburgh 
hospitals. Though well-known as 
a lecturer before various local 
groups, Father Foley is probably 
best remembered by old Pittsburgh 
sports fans as a member of the fam
ed Knickerbocker Basketball team 
which played in the early 20s.
Rabbi Charles Lesser, the third 
speaker, has arrived only recently 
in Pittsburgh, having previously 
held pulpits in Michigan and Texas.
Also a former sports enthusiast, 
Rabbi Lesser explained that his 
chief interest now lies in cement
ing better relationships between all 
religious groups and peoples. A 
graduate of Hebrew Union College 
in Cincinnati, Rabbi Lesser is now 
Assistant Rabbi of Rodef Shalom 
Temple and Chaplain to the Jew
ish soldiers stationed at Pitt.
Schedule
DATE
Thursday, Feb. 24
will be a brief forum during which 
time the audience will have an op
portunity to ask questions which 
they want the clergymen to answer 
in the evening.
Tonight at 8:00 in the Margaret 
Morrison Recreation Hall these
same men will conduct a round-ta
ble discussion and forum on the sub
jects they talked about in Chapel. 
Previous to the evening program 
the clergymen will have eaten with 
the students in their dormitories 
and fraternity houses.
Throughout the week religious 
leaders from the Pittsburgh district 
will speak informally to the various 
sororities, fraternities and indepen
dent organizations on campus. Foi 
lowing tradition, the students will 
have an opportunity at this time to 
ask the speakers any personal or 
group questions pertaining +o relig
ion.
Hello! Are you doing any

ITHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1944
The Outlook . . .Z<&tivuL AlmclicUsi
Faith In Tomorrow
This week we have been asked to delve into our thoughts and our 
diverse philosophies so that we may determine where we stand on the 
question of religion. Many of us consider it a vital part of our day-to-day 
life. Others think of it only as the last haven of refuge to be sought when 
all else has failed. Some think of it as an escape from the realistic.
Today, with all that is opposed to religion synonymous with every 
interest we are fighting, it behooves us, as the educators of tomorrow, to 
give religion the consideration which it deserves as the spiritual component 
of our intellectual lives. (By religion we do not necessarily meafn organiz
ed religion as such. . . . )
In our role of striving for that which is right and just, we find that we 
are possessors of the task of perpetuating the precepts of true religion that 
have been handed down through the ages, for in religion lies the basis for 
all that is righteousness and justice. Peace, tolerance, love of our fellow 
manthese are the goals of a better world, and these are the basic teach
ings of every faith, be it Catholicism, Protestantism, or Judaism.
It is the purpose of the religious groups on campus to awaken within 
the student a realization of the importance of a spiritual life. Faith need 
not be overt. A mans religion can be effective though it be merely a mani
festation of a belief in something, a something that is greater than war, 
greater than life. L. S.
Here We Go Again Department
From the War Department, this past week, there came one of the best, 
and most official rumors yet. The college-training program of the Army 
will be curtailed drastically, it said.
Immediately work started. More and more official reports came 
from more and more official sources. The end of the ASTP is only a mat
ter of hours, they said. Every GI will be off every college campus by the 
first of March. Every basic will be sent to a rifle platoon alerted for 
overseas; every advanced will be sent to a heavy weapons company 
already over. Language and area students will be put in the paratroopers 
and dropped over their respective countries. At the U of Pitt the boys 
packed and tore for the supply room with their books ready to go on their 
delay enroute. Incredible as it may be, the rumor situation is worse now 
than it was during the week of January 24.
The main thing to keep in mind is that all of this deal is strictly from 
hunger. No one on this, or any other campus, has received word from the 
War Department as to the authenticity of this report. It may be trueit 
may not. But until such time as it is, if ever, confirmed by notice from the 
Military Office, it is nothing more than a rumor. That is point No. 1.
Point No. 2 is a question. How long have you been in the Army, bud?
Ever since the ASTP was created, it has been the source and point of 
more rumors than all the other branches of the Army combined. Cer
tainly not a week passes without some absolutely straight dope making 
the rounds. The fact thyat this one came over the radio, and was printed in 
the paper makes it more believable than most of the others. But believ
able or not, the Army is still one grand place for rumors.
How long have you been in the Army, bud?

A week ago Monday, George 
Shuster, President of Hunter Col
lege, New York City, the largest 
college for women in the world, sent 
a letter to the members of the fac
ulty in which he denounces certain 
derogatory and insulting remarks 
made by some teachers in their 
classes. He specifically mentions 
and henceforth forbids any state
ments to the effect that a) America 
was tricked into this war, b) that 
all Catholics and the Papacy are 
fascists supporting our enemies, c) 
that the Russian type of govern
ment and the Russian ideology are 
superior to our own, d) that the 
Jews constitute a race, inferior and 
unassimilable, and e) that all Ne
groes are inferior to white persons, 
and may and should be discriminat
ed against.
The first impulse of any liberal 
person is to praise this letter as a 
courageous step towards the elimi
nation of discrimination and big
otry. Too many persons in influen
tial positions, teachers and others, 
have used their authority to propa
gate race hatred and distrust. But 
on second thought one begins to 
wonder whether President Shus
ters measure is really laudable.
Dt. Shuster is perfectly right in 
stating that academic freedom is not 
academic license, and that our socalled civil libertiesfreedom of 
speech, of press, or religionmust 
be and are limited by law and po
liteness. The former prohibits sedi
tious statements, and the latter tries 
to eliminate remarks which falsely 
and deliberately insult a group or 
nation. Thus the condemnation of 
anti-Negro, anti-Catholic, and antiJewish remarks is perfectly justi
fied, for anyone displaying such pre
judice is certainly unfit to hold any 
responsible position.
But Dr. Shuster goes beyond this, 
and by forbidding statements in 
favor of Russia, or against the 
Papacy he transgresses from the en
forcement of democracy to the au*

thoritative curbing of opinions. 
Why, for example, is it wrong to 
praise the Russian government, but 
quite permissible to discuss the rela
tive merit of the British cabinet Sys
tem and our form of government?' 
By what right can Dr. Shuster piphibit the expression of preference 
for the Russian ideology, and allow ^ 
the same thing for all others Z- Or 
why can a teacher not discuss the 
rather dubious attitude of the Vati
can during this crisis?
There is no need to mention any 
more specific details. The fu&d&*' 
mental question is apparent; where 
should we draw the line between a 
democratic and a dictatorial restric
tion of our civil liberties? The prob
lem is especially acute in the edu
cational field, and during the last 
few years the dismissals of some 
college professors have received na
tion-wide importance. There was, 
a while ago, the famous case of Dr. 
Turner of the University of Pitts
burgh, released because of his re
peated radical and often inslulting 
remarks in the classroom. Dr. Fran
cis MacMahon of Notre Dame was 
recently dismissed on similar 
grounds, and the famous Bertram 
Russell has clashed with many col
leges for years.
It does not actually matter what 
these men, and many others releas
ed on similar grounds, said in their 
classes. It is certain that they did 
not teach discrimination or actual 
sedition, but that all their state
ments were honest opinions based 
on accepted facts. Therefore, even 
if these opinions were wrong, no 
one had the right to prohibit their 
expression, for it is just as wrong 
to compel anyone to teach true doc
trines as it is to force a person to 
proclaim false ones. This is where 
Dr. Shuster defeated his own pur
pose, where his undemocratic means 
made his democratic end ineffec
tive. And it is our obligation as stu
dents to see that such things will 
not happen again. E. A. L.

We have been promising ourselves 
to write a column one of these days 
about those swell boys who are such 
integral parts of the Regimental 
Basketball Team. Without a doubt, 
Gaza is a terrific ball playera 
coachs dream. His record speaks 
ior itself. But what is to speak for 
those lads whose records show only 
a few points per game? These are 
the boys who are down under the 
bucket jumping for every ball that 
doesnt go inthe boys who pass 
the ball around so smoothly. They 
are the ones who set up the plays, 
who fight for the ball, and who 
jften take it away from opponents. 
Their box score records reveal none 
of this. One might think they play
ed only a few minutes of each game 
if he were to make a judgment from 
the box scores. To see them play is 
to applaud them. Then, and only 
then, can one appreciate the job 
they do. Captain Pickrel appreci
ates them, their teammates appre
ciate them, and those who see them 
from the sidelines know the reason 
why.
Crammer and Chapman score 
well in games and so give indica
tions in the box score of their worth 
to the team. DeBertoli, however, 
has only averaged two to three 
points a game. In fact, one specta
tor commented that he had a high 
scoring night the night he made five 
points. His handling of the ball on 
the floor is known to all consistent 
supporters of the team. Brown made 
rexactly zero points in the Camp 
Reynolds game, but those who saw 
he game must remember the finesse 
with which he handled the ball.
And so we see, the scoring aver
ages made by these players are not 
a fair measure of their true worth. 
We believe that credit should be 
*iven where it is due, and no one 
'an deny that these fellows have 
)een doing a fine job.

Tartans Are Unable 
To Stop Geneva; Lose 
Last Home Game, 66-33
Any basketball fan who likes to 
see a lot of long shots would have 
been in his seventh heaven at last 
Saturdays game with Geneva. 
Kane, Genevas 250 pound forward, 
drew first blood for the victors 
when he sunk a long one from the 
middle of the floor. The Tartans 
overcame Genevas early lead, how
ever, and throughout the remainder 
of the first period the game was 
closely fought.
The Covenanters really began to 
hit their stride in the second quar
ter, and the Tartans were unable to 
match the pace. Elmer Lipp was 
the big gun for Geneva during the 
first half, scoring 17 points for the 
victors.
In the third period, the long range 
bombardment really began. Devenzio seemed to be constantly swish
ing the hoops for Geneva, but Jack 
Sherman made several beautiful 
shots which helped to keep the Tar
tans in the game. Although the offi
ciating has been pretty rotten 
throughout most of the season, it 
seemed to me that late in this quar
ter it hit an all-time low. However, 
Maxie Hannums protests at this 
stage of the game did help to inject 
some color into an otherwise drab 
contest.
Throughout the final quarter 
coach Hannum substituted quite 
freely. In fact, by the end of the 
game Joe Kelly was the only mem
ber of the starting five who was still 
on the floor. Incidentally, this game 
marked the finish of Joes basket
ball career for Carnegie. Kelly was 
high scorer for the Tartans with 10 
points, and Jack Sherman was close 
behind with 9. Lipp led the scoring 
parade for Geneva with a total of 
27 points. The final score: Geneva

Tartan Marksmen Give 
Navy A Close Battle
In the midst of the basketball sea
son, one is often tempted to over
look the so-called minor sports. Nev
ertheless, the excellent job that the 
marksmen representing our rifle 
team did at Annapolis deserves revognition. The more highly trained 
Middies won by the narrow margin 
of 44 points. Only in the difficult 
standing position was the Navy able 
to demonstrate any real superiority 
over the Tartan sharpshooters.
Jim Morrison was high scorer for 
Carnegie with 278 points. Midship
men Monthan and Schulz each reg
istered 280 points of a possible 300 
for the victors. Johnny Rice had a 
perfect score in the prone position 
for the Tartans. The final score 
showed Navy to be on the long end 
of a 1389-Carnegie 1345.
Uniteers Win Again 
Rout Teamsters 68-41
Notching its 13th win in 15 starts, 
the Regimental Basketball quintet 
walloped the Teamsters of the Muny 
league last Thursday night to the 
tune of 68-41. Sparked by Gaza and 
Chapman, who scored 43 points be
tween them, the Unit team gained a 
king-sized measure of revenge for 
their defeat at the hands of Mellon 
Institute, the current cellar dwellers 
of the municipal league. The Team
ster outfit is the current pace setter 
of the same league.
The second half spelled the dif
ference as Gaza and Chapman paced 
their team in its pull from a half 
time 35-27 lead to a 53-34 score at 
the three quarter mark, and an 
eventual win by a 27 point margin.

News From Panama!
COLON, Jan. 12.The charge of 
reckless driving is seen as being 
perfectly exemplified today in the 
striking by a chiva of a laborer 
trundling a wheel-barrow filled 
with concrete with resulting in
juries as serious as virtually to pre
clude saving of the laborers right 
leg, if he recovers to need that leg.
The victim was Cruz Gonzalez, 35, 
Panamanian, who was at work on 
a building under construction at 14th 
Street and Melendez Avenue about
8 A. M. As Gonzalez lowered his 
wheelbarrow over the curb he was 
struck with such force as to be 
thrown against the curb and knock
ed unconscious. A compound frac
ture of the leg, together with other 
serious injuries, indicates that the 
laborer was run over by the chiva, 
but witnesses differ as to whether 
he was actually run over or merely 
struck by the vehicle. His condition 
is reported by Amador Hospital doc
tors as very grave.
No statement has been released 
from Fulcones Jean Felix, 58 Martiniquian, driver of the chiva, who 
is confined in Colon Jail pending 
probe of the case by City Attorney 
Clemente G. Barrera.
P. S.  Now just what is a Chiva?

Things to Think About
(This is the fourth in a series of articles 
discussing the decline of registration in 
the evening school).
Dispensing education can be lik
ened to any other business enter
prise without detracting in any way 
from the ethical aspct which sur
rounds formal instruction.
When a business establishment 
opens its doors to commence trad
ing the management of the institu
tion, if it is alert and awake, ex
tends invitations and solicits pro
spective customers. Numerous 
means are used to acquaint the pub
lic with certain facts and induce
ments in order to make the estab
lishment attractive as a place to do 
business. People see and hear of 
these solicitations and they make 
their purchases in the establish
ments and from the business houses 
where they think they can get good 
honest return for their money.
Once an institution is establish
ed, it continues to do business over 
a period of years enjoying the pa
tronage of a clientele. A good will 
has been built up, and the firm en
joys the confidence of its customers.
After a time, slowly at first, 
changes come about. There is a fall
ing off in the volume of business 
done; trading does not seem to be 
as brisk as it was, and other signs 
begin to appear. Some of these 
changes are the result of competi
tion; some may be attributed to 
carelessness or neglect, and some 
are inevitable. Whatever the 
causes, these changes take place 
and are reflected by the statistical 
compilation and recap of business 
done and transacted.
With the knowledge at hand, a 
wide awake business establishment 
takes hed at the warning and com
mences immediately to rectify con
ditions wherever possible. A check 
is made to find out the contributing 
causes and a stop is put to the de
cline in business turnover. All con
nected with the establishment are 
enlisted to prevent further reces
sion.
It is not a far-fetched analogy to 
liken Carnegie Tech to an honestly 
established business institutionfor 
does not Carnegie have something 
to offer, and surely it is interested in 
giving the best possible return to its 
customers for money spent. The 
customers are the students and the 
money spent in some respects is rep
resented by the tuition fees paid.
Social Fraternity 
Plans Theater Party
Sigma Delta Phi, Evening School 
social fraternity, is planning to hold 
a theater party at the Little Theater 
on March 11. This affair is in cele
bration of its fourth anniversary of 
existence on the campus and claims 
both day and evening school stu
dents as its members.
Although hard hit by the war 
program, with many of its members 
serving in every branch of the arm
ed services of our country, the fra
ternity is still quite active socially.
After the theater party, the group 
will round out the evening by going 
to have a midnight snack. Harold 
Parks is in charge of the affair.
Attention Girls! One of the boys 
from Mr. Pearsons Harmony I class 
is answering Uncle Sammys call. 
That means theres only one left. 
(Draw your own conclusions here!)
Hear Ye! Hear Ye! Something 
new has been added! And I do mean 
new. The Plaid Staff has just in
itiated a new worker who answers 
to the name of Doris Kenneweg  
(Shes blonde) . . . Among the G. I.s 
at our Valentine Party were seen:  
Privates Jerry Franko, Joe Darcey 
and Ray Jones. From what I saw 
they were doing all right with our 
evening school lassies . . . Incident
ally, girls and boys, if you should 
happen to arrive on the campus 
early some evening, drop in the can
teen. Youre sure to make and greet 
friends therewho knows?
Noticed Jane Hoffman showed up 
at class the other day after a short 
absence. And get this! She wasnt 
ill all that time! (Hm! Think Ill 
look into this).
Believe it or not, but Steve Marcinizyn is developing callouses on 
his hands from winding his watch. 
He wonders if Maggy Murph will 
surrender some of those Co-Eds 
over there to apply some first aid in 
this case. (Steve: Whats wrong 
with your family doctor?)
Jim Agardy! Im surprised at you. 
Whats this I hear about you receiv
ing a ticket for failing to stop at a 
red light in your great haste to get 
to school? Even nowadays with the 
gas shortage and slower speed lim
its, you cant watch that redhead on 
every corner.
OLDIERLPTDA
Carnegie Tech is honored by hav
ing as one of its students Catherine 
Savage, President of the Catholic 
Theater Guild. Catherine has been 
with the Guild for six of the seven 
years that it has been in existance. 
On Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, 
and Sunday nights, she can be found 
at the Guild rehearsal studio at 206 
Stanwix Street, putting her all into 
making the four major productions 
and six minor productions, present
ed by the Guild each year, success
ful. The Comedian by Henri 
Gheon, the Guilds latest undertak
ing, is an example of the outstand
ing work produced, and was very 
favorably received by the many 
people who saw it presented at the 
Frick School last Tuesday and Wed
nesday.
Starting February 26, the Guild 
will broadcast a weekly, half-hour 
program which will continue 
through the entire Lenten season.
The purpose of the Guild is to 
present on the stage and on the ra
dio the Catholic way of living; and 
under the leadership of Miss Sav
age, it is making its results farreaching.
