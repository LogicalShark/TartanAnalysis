Colleg es Plan 
Bridge Joust
A contract bridge tournament 
for the 1947 national inter-col
legiate championship was an
nounced this week by the Inter
college Bridge Tournament Com
mittee. This group, which prior 
to the war and in 1946 sponsored 
undergraduate bridge tourna
ments, is limited to colleges in 
the Eastern states.
The 1947 event will be a dupli
cate tournament for undergradu
ate pairs, with the title of Na
tional Intercollege Champions go
ing to the winning team. Prelim
inary rounds will be conducted by 
mail. Sixteen teams representing 
every section of the country will 
be selected through the mail com
petition for face-to-face finals in 
Chicago on April 18 and 19.
Official approval by the author
ities in each participating college 
is required before the Committee 
accepts entries.
The Intercollege Bridge Tourna
ment Committee supports the 
event so that there is no cost to 
the competing colleges nor the 
players. It is a group of alumni in
terested in developing bridge as 
an intercollegiate sport in which 
men and women compete on an 
equal basis. Earlier tournaments 
run by the Committee have been 
endorsed by the Association of 
Student Unions.
The 1946 event, limited to col
leges in the Northeastern area but 
with Kansas State as an invited 
guest, was won by Cornell in a 
field of 42 competitors. The Kan
sas team finished second.
An invitation to enter the 1947 
tournament will be sent within 
the next few weeks to the dean 
or a corresponding authority in 
more than? 300 colleges accredited 
by the Association of American 
Universities.

Addresses Tech 
S.A.M. Tonight
The next meeting of the Car
negie Tech chapter of the Society 
for Advancement of Management 
will be tonight, Tuesday, October 
22, at 8 p. m. in the Carnegie 
Union. Mr. W. Wesley Cooley, 
supervisor of Industrial Training 
for the Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation, will address the

On Friday evening, October 18, 
the Carnegie Tech chapter was 
formally installed at a smoker 
given at the Carnegie Union. Mr. 
William Witte, Vice President of 
the James H. Matthews Company, 
made the formal presentation as 
president of the Pittsburgh chap
ter.
The Carnegie Tech group was 
organized last June, and during 
the summer held three profes
sional meetings, six seminars, and 
a round table discussion. The dis
cussion proved so successful that 
another is being planned for the 
last Vocational Council forum, 
with a new group of leading man
agement engineers for the panel.
The Pittsburgh chapter, com
posed of Pittsburgh industrialists, 
has been very helpful in obtaining 
speakers who are the leading men 
in industry. Pertinent subjects

Frosh Dance Features 
Bill Leroys Orchestra
Student Council sponsored a 
dance last Saturday evening from 
nine to one in the well decorated 
gymnasium, featuring Bill LeRoys music. Approximately 400 
couples were present to open offi
cially the all-school dances and 
to remove Freshmen Regulations. 
One of the purposes of the dance 
was to provide an opportunity for 
all students to become better ac
quainted. This objective seemed 
to be obtained, as most of the 
freshmen class came with mem
bers of the other classes.
The decorators, Dotty Hallas, 
Jean Lisle, and Fuzzy Thurs
ton were ^widely complimented op 
their work. With the harvest 
theme setting the prevailing mood, 
the gym was converted for this 
dance by placing several corn 
shocks in strategic places, attach
ing many decorative pictorial de
signs to the walls and by using 
long blue streamers sloping from 
the center to the sides as the sky. 
Colored spotlights helped accentu
ate the focal point. A large water 
tank in which several bushels of 
juicy apples were floating was 
placed in the center of the gym.
Saroyans 66Time of Your Life 
First Dramatic Presentation
The Drama Department will 
open this seasons series of eight 
productions by presenting Wil
liam Saroyans Time of Your 
Life at the Little Theatre in the 
Fine Arts building. Opening night 
will be Tuesday, October 29, with 
curtain time for all showings 
scheduled for 8:30 p. m. Mr. Hen
ry Boettcher, head of the Drama 
Department, will direct the show 
which will run nightly through 
Wednesday. November 6.
The setting of the first play is 
a waterfront dive in San Fran
cisco. The story concerns the 
thoughts and actions of the peo
ple  drunks, streetwalkers, long
shoremen, and cops, who frequent 
the place. The views of life as 
expressed by Saroyans characters 
are sometimes shocking, but often 
hilarious. Although there is little 
of action of the conventional sort, 
an abundance of dialogue keeps 
the audience interested and amus
ed.
The cast for this production will 
consist of two players for each 
role, with the two sets of players 
alternating for various perform
ances. The double cast consists of 
the following:
Joe  James Schmidt; A1 
Zeidman
Tom  Les Stratford; Jack 
Klugman 
Nick  Elek Hartman; Vin
cent OBrien
Kitty  Mary Elizabeth 
Kane; Edith Loew

Student Council 
Holds Assembly
The reduction of the number of 
representatives on the Student 
Council will be considered at a 
general assembly to be held at 
11:30 a. m., Tuesday, October 29, 
in the Little Theater.
Article II, Section 1, Paragraph 
C, of the Constitution of the Stu
dent Council, provides that there 
shall be one representative for 
each 100 members of the student 
body. This ratio worked with a 
normal student body of two thous
and, but would require a Council 
of thirty-three members with the 
present large attendance. The 
proposed amendment, which will 
require the approval of two-thirds 
of the students present at the as
sembly for adoption, calls for a 
ratio of one member for each 150 
students, reducing the Council to 
its pre-war size.
Streamers from the roof to this 
apple-pool aided in making it dis
tinctive.
During the intermission, several 
groups gave impromptu serenades, 
featuring the old-time favorites 
and some of the popular tunes of 
the day.
Womens Dorms 
Sponsor Parties
Forbes Hall sponsored a pa
jama party on Thursday, October
10, and followed up with a party 
for the vets on Sunday, October
13. Mellon Hall sponsored a bridge 
party for their girls on Friday, 
October 11, and last Friday held 
a party for the girls and their in
vited dates.
At Mellon Halls party on Fri
day twenty couples danced to rec
ords in a room attractively deco
rated with crepe paper, paper lan
terns, corn stalks, and candle
light. Prizes were awarded for a 
number of games such as bobbing 
for apples. Cider, doughnuts, and 
candy were served for refresh
ment. Natalie Friedman, the chair
man of the social committee at 
Mellon, had charge of arranging 
the party, she was assisted by 
Lois Shaffer and Marie Minnemeyer.
The bridge party on Friday, 
October 11, was attended by all 
the bridge fans of the dorm. Re
freshments were served and prizes 
were awarded. Mrs. Pool, house
mother at Mellon, won the first 
prize. Louise Ferranti and Mary 
Graham won the second and third 
prizes. %
The upperclass girls of Forbes 
Hall gave a pajama party for the 
freshman girls in Forbes Annex. 
Phyllis Petrikin directed the girls 
in some humorous skits. .
Mrs. Williams, house-mother at 
Forbes, invited all the veterans 
who had roomed there last sum
mer to a party on October 13 to 
meet the girls. Records were play
ed all evening and punch and 
cookies were served.
Arrau Is Soloist
Dr. Fritz Reiner will conduct 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches
tra in the second concert of its 
twentieth anniversary season at 
8:30 P. M. Friday, October 25 in 
the Syria Mosque. The perform
ance will be repeated at 3:00 p. 
m. Sunday, October 27. Featured 
as guest soloist will be Claudio 
Arrau, internationally famous 
Chilean pianist. Mr. Arrau will 
play Beethovens Piano Concer
to No. 3 in C minor. The program 
also includes Berlioz Benvenuto 
Cellini Overture and Robert Schu
manns Symphony No. 3 in Eflat (Rhenish), as edited by 
GUS*" WshW,
Prom Stars 
Buddy Rich
The 1946 Junior Prom, schedul
ed for the evening of Saturday, 
November 16, will feature the 
music of Buddy Rich, the Young 
Man and His Drums.
The members of Delta Skull, 
junior mens activities honorary 
with the help of Dean James Dick
inson, have obtained the services 
of one of the nations most pop
ular dance orchestras, in the hope 
of renewing the parade of name 
bands to Carnegie dances. The 
affair will be strictly informal in 
compliance with the requests of 
the many men who have been 
searching in vain for that post
war tux.
Buddy Richs last musical job 
before forming his own aggrega
tion of first rate musicians was a 
long stretch of drumming for 
Tommy Dorsey. His latest picture 
with the T. D. band is MGMs 
Thrill of a Romance. Buddy not 
only presents his terrific drum 
solos, but is also a top notch vo
calist. His voice resembles that 
of Frank Sinatra, who by the 
way, was his principal backer 
when the band was first organiz
ed.
Tickets for the big event will be 
obtainable soon in Skibo and from 
the members of Delta Skull.
VA Announces 
Mailing of Checks
Mr. C. N. Abernathy, VA

Law 346 (G. I. Bill) who entered 
October 1, 1946, will receive their 
subsistence checks during the first 
ten days of November. Most of 
the checks will be mailed to the 
address indicated on the original 
Certificate of Eligibility, although 
in many cases, Change of Ad
dress form have been submitted 
to the Veterans Administration. 
New addresses will probably be 
used on checks received on De

on Supplemental Certificates of 
Eligibility and whose schools were 
located outside of Allegheny Coun
ty will be paid only when thei.* 
pay cards are received by the

County this Thursday, October 
17th, in a drive to raise $4,651,857 
for 90 local Community Chest 
agencies and Allegheny Countys 
share of the National USO. Thirty 
thousand Red Feather solicitors 
from this district will canvass 
thoroughly every home, plant, of
fice, and shop in Allegheny Coun

tributions of last year. He 
pointed out that four out of every 
ten families in Allegheny County 
receive direct service from Red 
Feather agencies each year.

Editors Armchair
Veterans vs. Citizens?
Several years ago many of you put your individual lives in
to storage to become links in the armed forces of the United 
States. After an extensive period of time, during which you were 
witnesses to and participants in this mad phase of modern 
civilization called war, the military leaders finally got together 
and signed a few papers. This act ushered in that interim be
tween wTars called peacewhen nations stab each other in 
the back instead of dropping bombs in each others lap.
Then came the transition. You were no longer soldiers; you 
were  veterans,  an elastic title which lumps an incompatible, 
incongruous assortment of rich-poor, educated-uneducated, goodbad, skilled-unskilled into an adherent body of brave, noble, and 
loyal Americans.
By some vagary of logic, it was concluded that discharged 
soldiers would make good, thinking citizens. Through this same 
reasoning, the country has come to expect small miracles from 
its veterans in the way of leadership, reform, and progressive 
action.
Whether the hopeful :theory that good soldiers will be good 
citizens materializes or disintegrates is entirely up to you.
Certainly many of you student veterann are dissatisfied with 
the state of the wrorld, and want :to achieve a functioning democ
racy, a potent world organization, and a purposeful peace. You 
who feel thus, are the basis for our hopes that the men who 
won the war can win the peace.
This is not easy. The individual in a democracy is not as allpowerful as the blue-prints specify. There are all sorts of or
ganizations, lobbies, and blocks standing immovably in the way. 
Numbers talk. It takes a group to fight a group; so if you want 
to sell an idea or instigate a reform or just be a participating 
citizen in your community, it is almost imperative that you join 
a group with purposes similar to yours.
Already you have probabljr been besieged with stacks of 
propaganda from a multiplying selection of veterans organiza
tions. Some of these are old and established; some are newborn. 
A few' are fly-by-night; a few even un-American. Before joining 
any one, it would be wise to become thoroughly acquainted 
with several.
No national veterans organization has been established at 
Carnegie Tech. This is in keeping with administrative policy 
which believes that as a college, CIT should not sponsor or 
endorse any veterans organization. A student who wishes to 
join such a group can easily affiliate with the local branch. A 
campus chapter is neither necessary nor advisable in a city the 
size of Pittsburgh. This is a sensible stand and should in no 
way be regarded as prejudice or indifference.
Although no national affiliation has been installed at CIT, 
the student veterans on campus have formed their own organiza
tion under the name of Tecvets. Originally it was hoped that 
Tecvets wrould assume its own character, one originating in the 
demands of the students. However, until now Tecvets has assumed 
no character at all. Whether this is a reflection on the students 
or merely a weakness on the part of organization is a debatable 
question. In any case, Tecvets fails to fill the bill.
At present the American Veterans Committee, a live-wire vet 
organization, is in the process of forming an all-college chapter 
for the students of Pitt, Tech, and Duquesne. Since college vet
erans would be inclined to have similar problems, interests, and 
intentions, such a grouping has distinct advantages and is in 
no way contradictory to the Institutes policy.
Those of you who are striving for effective citizenship may 
do well to investigate this particular veterans organization.
Differing from the majority of conservative World War I 
organizations, it is composed entirely of purposeful young veter
ans like yourself. Started by a wounded veterans of the battle of 
El Alemain, Charles G. Bolte, A.V.C. has successfully pursued a 
firmly liberal policy designed to consider the interests of the 
veteran as identical to those of the citizen.
However, we are not trying to sell you veterans organiza
tions in general or any one organization in particular. It is merely 
our intention lay some facts before you and to hang out in 
plain sight that vital question: Will good soldiers necessarily 
become good citizens? From there on its entirely up to you.
By Carl Klahr
Much as J. Carroll Reece, Re
publican National Chairman, 
would like to keep it under cover, 
his political party is almost as 
sharply divided as the Democrats.
You havent heard much about 
this because GOP big-wigs con
sider party unity one of their ma
jor talking points. And if they 
had unity it would be. Time and 
again the present Democratic con
gress has stymied the incumbent 
Democratic administration by re
fusing to pass legislation having 
the party O. K., and as a result 
confusion is rife. The Republicans 
are capitalizing on this wishywashyness. Senator Robert A. Taft 
of Ohio told a GOP rally this week 
that the Democrats were split on 
a bitter difference in principle 
and no one can tell what their 
future policies will be. Touche. 
But the Republicans are sharply 
split themselves into conservative 
and liberal elements. 
Conservatives Active in 
Republican Party
The conservative branch of the 
Republican family is exemplified 
by Messrs. Taft, Bricker, and Co., 
who are as conservative as they 
come. A few years ago, when Taft 
and Bricker were political strip
lings, the right wingers were led 
by the Martin-Barton-Fish com
bine that F. D. Roosevelt, a clev
er catch-phrase maker, laughed to 
defeat. The conservatives have 
dominated the Republicans in the 
past, because, among other things, 
they represent the policy of 
laissez-faire in business which 
opens the money bags to them. In 
Pennsylvania, for instance, Grun
dy, and J. Pew of the Sun Oil Co., 
staunch right-wingers, have re
peatedly replenished the Repub
lican coffers.
Isolationism Is No Longer Policy 
Of Old Guard Republicans
Among the policies of the Old 
Guard champions are high tariffs 
(with a consequent curtailment 
of foreign trade), no foreign loans, 
no bureaucracy, no government 
projects like TVA, and very free 
enterprise. This faction is certain
ly the stronghold of rugged in
dividualists. It may sponsor anti
labor legislation, but it will never 
inaugurate social reforms. At pres
ent, right-wingers want a balanc
ed budget, a 20% cut in income 
taxes, and a big slash in the fed
eral payroll, all laudable goals  
if they can get them. In the pre
war years the Old Guard had a 
definite isolationist hue, but now, 
they say, they are cured of iso
lationism.
Liberal Republicans Follow 
Willkies Lead
The liberal Republicans are on 
the other side of the fence. They 
are the spiritual heirs of Wendell 
Willkie, who, rumor has it, glad
dened the hearts of the old-line 
bosses when he lost the 1940 elec
tion. The liberals are led by Gov
ernor Earl Warren of California, 
Harold Stassen of Minnesota, Saltonstall in Massachusetts, Ray 
Baldwin in Connecticut, and 
Wayne Morse in Oregon. (Where 
Dewey stands even the yogas dont 
know.)
Liberals Support Many New 
Deal Policies
These men and their followers 
appreciate the social significance 
of the New Deal, which despite 
many mistakes, was at least an 
active effort to cope with the sit
uation, says Stassen. Progressive 
Republicans, Stassen further im
plies, would like to rectify and 
extend the New Deal program. 
They contemplate action in spheres 
the Old Guard would never dream 
of .touching, in violation of laissezfaire private enterprise. Stassen, 
as their spokesman, proposes to 
get more government aid for city 
housing, to regulate credit more 
closely, to keep taxes higher, to 
enforce anti-monopoly legislation,

Student Council
While Techites kept activities 
at a minimum during the sum
mer months, Student Council held 
five meetings to discuss current 
questions. The minutes of these 
sessions were approved at the 
first fall meeting, since no quorum 
could be obtained at any time 
during the summer.
Questions before the Council 
included the revision of Freshmen 
regulations plus the Point Sys
tems for men and women. Budgets 
of the following organizations 
were given the Councils stamp 
of approval for the coming school 
year: Delta Skull, O. D. K., Scottie, Scimitar, and Spring Carnival.
The 1946-47 Social Calendar 
was another item on the agenda. 
It was arranged in such a manner 
that two all-school functions 
would not fall on consecutive 
week-ends, thereby allowing oth
er organizations to utilize the 
free time for closed affairs
Approval was also given for the 
staff of the Technical. After com
pleting these important questions, 
Council closed their books until 
the fall meeting.

To The End Man
Does Casey Stine have some
thing on the editors of the Tartan 
and hold the threat of blackmail 
over their heads? Or does he, she 
or it own the paper mill or print
ing press? Is that individual a 
relative of President Doherty or 
some influential faculty member? 
In other words, is there any good 
reason why we have to read the 
pure, unadulterated drivel that is 
presented under the heading. End 
Man on the Senior Fence. We 
dont know if the personage is a 
he or she  the writer claims to 
be End Man, but writes like a 
she  at any rate, the column is 
tripe as far as were concerned 
and we cant see how it could pos
sibly interest anyone. Who cares 
what Casey Stine did during the 
summer? If he or she had jumped 
in the proverbial lake and pro
verbially failed to come up for 
the proverbial third time, the 
Tartan would have had 23 more 
column inches (thats the space 
End Man wasted last week), 
which it could have been put to 
better use. For example, it could 
have reported the doings of the 
various fraternities and sororities 
during rushing week. Or more of 
the activities of other organiza
tions on campus. Readers would 
have been more interested in that
than in what Casey Stine did. If 
you cant find news to fill in space, 
please give us a cross word puzzle 
or comic strip, or failing that, just 
a statement, Here is where 
Stines column would have been. 
Rejoice  you dont have to read 
it.

Thick As Dust
Dear Editor:
Every time I go into the librar
ies, I clean off a shelf of dusty 
books. Although I am slowly dust
ing them off, I believe it will take 
several years before I will be able 
to complete the job. Meanwhile I 
am running up quite a bill for 
soap. In the interest of conserving 
such scarce items, I suggest that 
the libraries be well dusted.
However, there is an alternative! 
Let the Social Relations Depart
ment get wind of the situation. 
They would start a drive for con
sulting reference books and thus 
the library could be cleaned up 
within a few days.
I am frightened by the thought 
of running into one of those par
ticles labeled 44 Eng. Will it ever 
graduate?
Sincerely yours and vith dirty 
hands,Simon Foner.
Because a quorum was not 
present, the special meeting of 
Oct. 8 could not be termed a reg
ular Student Council meeting. 
Therefore all motions passed at 
this meeting must be approved by 
the Council at the next regular 
meeting.
The SAEs requested permis
sion to hold a Tea Dance for 
Freshmen Women in Thistle Hall, 
October 17, from 4:30 to 6:30 p. m. 
Motion carried.
The Freshmen Dance to be held 
on October 19 was discussed and 
the budget was discussed and ap
proved.
Mr. Christenson requested per
mission to extend Freshman Reg
ulations to October 22, because of 
the power strike. This request 
was denied. Therefore, the Reg
ulations will end as scheduled on 
Friday, October 18, as previously 
planned.
It was suggested that a Pep 
Rally be held in the Bowl on Fri
day, October 11, at 8:00. The 
rally will be under the direction 
of the cheerleaders.
Mr. Engle moved that each or
ganization submit a constitution 
to the Council. Motion carried.
A committee was appointed to 
investigate the reactivation of 
Scotch and Soda.
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 is 
to be regular meeting time of Stu
dent Council.
Respectfully submitted,
Jean M. Price, Secretary.

WAA Recruiting Candidates 
For Hockey, Swimming, Tennis89 Pledge Sororities 
As Rushing Season EndsGirls . . . Do you desire to be 
an ALL AMERICAN? Be the 
envy of your dorm, sorority, or 
neighborhood  in short, be a 
Varsity Girl? The Womens Ath
letic Association needs candidates 
for the varsity field hockey team. 
Already about 40 brave volunteers 
are hacking away at each other 
on the Cut. The only require
ments are gym clothes and hockey 
stick and shin guards, the latter 
two furnished by the school. Of 
course, a reservation at any local 
hospital will eliminate a lot of 
worry  we play rough. Audrey 
Wilkins, president of W.A.A., has 
hinted that the members of the 
varsity team may be provided 
with medical care and other small 
courtesies such as: free room and 
board, date service, and exemp
tion from all finals. All kidding
Intramural
Roundup
Eighteen teams taking to the 
local triplicate gridiron last week 
gives your intramural reporter 
plenty to say. Coach Risedorph 
has divided the boys into three 
leagues with handles that are 
strictly flag-wavers  National, 
American, and Federal. They were 
drawn out of the hat. and it looks 
like the National drew the rough
est lot.
There were eight contests sched
uled for the week; but only seven 
came off, however, as the DUs 
and the Phi Kaps decided they 
would entertain the freshman 
women instead and play ball at 
a later date.
Three contests opened the sea
son for the American League. The 
PiKAs downed the Dorm Com
bine 13-5 as Bigley blocked a kick 
over the goal line and snagged a 
pass on the flat to put the game 
on ice for the greek letter boys. 
The lone GDI tally came on a 
long pass to King in the closing 
minutes of the game.
The SAEs nosed out the Tau 
Delts 12-6, and the Beta Sigs took 
the boys from FPHA-1 26-0 to 
make it a three-way tie for both 
the cellar and the top of the 
American league. Bill Cartenson 
snagged two touchdown passes for 
the SAEs victory, while the Beta 
Sigs had a field day with five dif
ferent men crossing the double 
strip.
The National League started off 
with some wide open football. 
Two powerful independent teams 
the Kilroy A.C. and the T.N.T.s, 
who won every thing they entered 
last year  met in the opening 
game. The final score Kilroy A.C. 
19, T.N.T.18. The A.C. led all 
the way, taking the lead early as 
they combined a pair of first 
downs and a pair of passes to 
Banko for 12 points. One TD in 
the first stanza for the TNTs and 
an exchange of five pointers in the 
second left the TNTs trailing 
18-11 at half-time. A scoreless 
third period and three first downs 
in the fourth made the score board 
read 19-13. Then Katsafraus grab
bed his third touchdown pass of 
the day to bring the TNTs within 
one point of victory.
The other contest in the Na
tional Division was a brutal bat
tle of first downs with the TXs 
coming out on top with three to 
the Betas one.
In the Federal league the Delts 
overcame an 8-2 half-time deficit 
to win 14-8 from the ATOs, and 
the Kappa Sigs lost a close one to 
FPHA-2 by an 8-7 count.
The ATOs built up an early lead 
on three first down and an inter
ception by Schier that was good 
for five points. It was eight-all en
tering the final quarter. The Delts 
inarched down the field with Har
low skirting left end from the 
one-foot line to clinch the game.
The feature attractions this 
week should be this afternoon 
with the Phi Kaps testing out the 
Kilroy A.C. and tomorrow when 
the TXs tackle the DUs. Thurs
day the Delts take on the Federal 
leagues dark horsean independ
ent organ ization calling themselves 
the Musical Maulers.
aside, we really would like to see 
more girls at practice, and we 
know you will enjoy hockey. Ex
perience isnt necessary since Miss 
Allen and the girls are willing and 
eager to help newcomers. The sea
son will continue until Thanks
giving and the climax will be a 
game with P.C.W. Practices are 
scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, 
and Wednesday at 4:30. Candi
dates may sign up in the Womens 
Gym office at any time.
The tennis courts will be free 
for W.A.A. use at scheduled hours. 
These hours are posted in the 
gym office.
Tryouts will be held October 22 
for those interested in joining the 
Dance club.
Archery is scheduled for Wed
nesday at 3:30 and Thursday at 
3:30.
The swimming pool is open 
Wednesday evening from 7:00 un
til 10:00, and Saturday afternoon 
from 2:00 to 4:00, except when a 
home football game is being play
ed.
All women registered at Car
negie Tech are members of W. 
A. A. To be active, girls need on
ly come to the gym in their free 
time. Team sports are scheduled 
at definite hours but the gym is 
always open.

Booters Top Frostburg For First Win
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
To correct an error I made last week, Stan March (the voice you 
heard over the P.A. system at the Oberlin game) is one of the aces 
behind Tech publicity. Sorry for the omission, Stan.
One of the saddest listeners to the World Series in these parts was 
Ash Etkes. Ash wasnt particularly concerned about either the Sox 
or the Cards, but spent most of his time brooding over the facts that 
his beloved Bums lost to the St. Louis crew. In true Brooklyn fashion, 
Ash has only one comment to make, Waitll next year!
In all fairness to a fighting Frostburg soccer team, let me say 
that the officiating of Saturdays game was one of the worst jobs Ive 
ever seen. Both teams agreed on this following the game, and they 
also agreed that the cause was sort of obvious. To save the ref em
barrassment, it wouldnt be mentioned here.
Incidently, the Tech booters did remarkably well considering the 
condition they were in. Cloyd Mellott was suffering from a ripped leg 
he got in the Slippery Rock affair. Red Kindblom had a sprained 
stack of muscles in his side received when he flattened a Slippery 
Rock player. I had the questionable pleasure of pulling 15 yards of 
tape off Reds side after the game. He wouldnt have felt bad 
about it if his skin hadnt come off too. In addition to these casualties, 
there were many more minor in- ' 
flictions which slowed the boys up 
considerably. Most of these in
flictions were caused by the ap
pearance of so many familiar fac
es at The Grecian Room late Fri
day night that the boys found it 
hard to break away and head for 
the sack. (Ed noteHow did 
Heckman find out?)
Many thanks to the Athletic 
Dept, and the Grounds Crew for 
fixing things up for the soccer 
team. They not only made it pos
sible for them to play in The 
Bowl, but they even got the prac
tice field in shape. The gophers 
got exterminated and the grass 
got mowed.
Soccer Team Here Sat.
Be There!
A roaring crowd of 20,000 x 10-3 
witnessed the boosters in action 
Saturday. Great! They had a 
swell time. Its too bad the rest 
of the school thinks football is 
the only sport being played around 
here. Soccer could be as popular 
as football and basketball if the 
other 3400 people in school could 
drag their little selves out of bed 
on Saturday mornings. This in
cludes the cheerleaders. If they 
would come along on a trip to the 
other colleges around here, and 
see how these schools support 
their soccer teams, maybe theyd 
come to life long enough to realize 
that their responsibility does not 
stop with football and basketball.
The team plays' its next four 
games at home starting Saturday 
morning with Slippery Rock. Itll 
be a corker, so get the hell out 
there and yell! 
Cantini Picks 19H Out of 20,
But 4
Just because I cant count 
straight, Andy Cantini got chisel
ed out of a chance to gloat this 
week. In that We Predict col
umn last "week, there were sup
posed to be the predictions of 
twenty college games, but because 
Heckman never learned his arith
metic, most of it had to be left 
out. Nobody will believe this, but 
Andy, who made the predictions, 
picked everything right except the 
Cornell-Yale game which ended 
in a tie.
Bert Munhall has come through 
in grand style again. The Wizard 
of the Wounded fixed Capt. Ben 
Baklarz. up with a super-helmet 
to allow Ben to play football with 
his injury. Berts latest was a de
vice that looked like a life-pre
server which Kindblom wore to 
keep his wrenched side out of 
trouble.
Harriers Win 
Opener, 23-32
' Captain Bill Beamer led the 
way as the Tartan Cross Country 
squad opened its season last Sat
urday against the Jeannette Har
riers. Bounding William loped 
around the SVz mile Schenley 
Park course in 21:07 to pace Guy 
Halfertys clan to a 23-32 vic
tory. Ivor Davies finished 100 
yards back of his team-mate and 
crossed the line in 21:16.

407 S. Craig St. MA. 2998
With the end of the war, the 
Tech campus has been the sight 
of many overdue reunions. One 
such as these took place at the 
Phi Kappa house last weekend 
when three former Carnegie foot
ball luminaries, Merlyn Condit, 
Pete Dobrus and Ted Pruger were 
guests at a dinner given in their 
honor. After the feast, a glorious 
bull session was indulged in by 
all.
For those of us who have for
gotten the days of Tech football 
greatness it might be well to re
call that these three fellows were 
the nucleus of the immortal 1938 
Sugar Bowl eleven. The talk dur
ing the evening centered gener
ally around this season as the boys 
rehashed each game as though 
they had been played yesterday 
instead of eight years ago. All 
agreed that the best game they 
played that year was the Pitt 
game in which they beat the 
Panthers 20 to 10. It was that 
game that George Muha ran wild 
and cinched a hold on All-Ameri
can honors.
The hardest game that season 
was the Holy Cross encounter 
when the Tartans handed Bill Osmanski and crew their only de
feat in three years of major col
lege competition.
Condit is wearing the colors of 
Rooney. U. these days after being
Md. Profs. Bow By 6-3; 
Mellott Scores Three
The Carnegie Tech soccer team made a successful home debut 
Saturday afternoon when they topped Frostburg State Teachers in 
a free-scoring content, 6-3. It was the second) game of the season for 
the Tartans who now have a .500 record. The game also marked the 
first time in two ye rs the sun has favored the team by showing 
its face.
Coach Pat OConnor made no less than seven changes in the 
starting line-up, and the new arrangement found Ken King, hereto
fore a halfback, in at inside-left. This brainstorm paid dividends in the 
first five minutes of the ball game as King took passes from Mellott 
and Marmo to bang home a left-footed boot for the Tartans first 
score of the season. The Techites came to life after that and continually
threatened the visitors goal, but
traded from the Brooklyn Foot
ball Dodgers where he earned 
himself quite a reputation as a 
hard runner. His best season was 
in 1942 when he was runner-up 
to his present team mate, Bill 
Dudley, in yards gained in the 
National Football League. Merlyn 
said that contrary to popular be
lief college ball is tougher than 
pro ball. The play-for-pay boys 
dont have that old college cocki
ness and by being able to block 
and tackle better dont have to 
take the chances that their col
lege counterparts do.
After a look around the pro 
league this fall, Condit feels that 
the team to beat is the Chicago 
Bears. They have the power and 
the reserve that it should take to 
win. He rated the New York 
Giants high until they were press
ed to eke out a 17 to 14 win over 
the Steelers two weeks ago.
Ted Pruger saw action during 
the war as a Lieutenant Com
mander in the Navy. Aboard his 
ship was a fellow named Kerr 
who you old timers will recall 
was the fellow that stole the ball 
from Condit in the 1939 Notre 
Dame game and went on to score 
their lone touchdown of the day 
and defeat the Tartans 7 to 6. 
That, incidentally, was the game 
that extinguished Techs hopes for
Gridders Meet 
Geneva Fri.
This Friday night at Reeves 
Stadium in Beaver Falls, the Tech 
gridders will engage the high fly
ing Geneva Covenanters in hopes 
of breaking into the win column. 
Not since the 17-14 victory over 
Buffalo on October 24, 1942 have 
the Tartans ended on the long 
end of a score. However, Techs 
aspirations may prove to be a 
little far fetched as Geneva is 
sporting one of the best teams in 
the grid district. After losing the 
first game to Youngstown, the 
Vovies, operating from the T, 
rebounded and took the count of 
Waynesburg, W & J, and Beth
any on successive Saturdays. 
Geneva is also sporting the lead
ing collegiate scorer in the state 
in the person of Bill Bruno, the 
fleet-footed halfback who has 
amassed a total of 49 points 
against four opponents. If the 
Skibo defense is able to stop 
Bruno, you can count us in for the 
long sought victory.
Coach Donohue has been drill
ing the boys hard in order to iron 
out the many flaws committed in 
the Oberlin mud splash. The ex
perience of that game has resulted 
in a decided improvement in both 
the offensive and defensive play.
Heisman Trophy 
Inspiration For 
Phi Kappa Award
In 1935 the Downtown Athletic 
Club of New York, Inc., one of the 
worlds largest Clubs and occupy
ing an entire thirty-six story 
building in lower Manhattan, de
cided to award a trophy to the 
Outstanding College Football 
Player in the United States.
The Heisman Memorial Trophy 
is footballs greatest individual 
award. The man who wins it 
comes to New York early in De
cember with his coach where be
fore a galaxy of football stars, 
past and present, he is fittingly 
honored and presented with an 
individual Heisman Memorial 
Trophy.
Carnegie Tech is to have its 
own version of the Heisman Tro
phy in the Most Valuable Player 
to be awarded during Winter Car
nival. As announced in last weeks 
Tartan, the Phi Kappa Fraternity 
is to present this award to the 
most Valuable player of the 1946 
squad.
The selection of the player to 
receive this award is left in hands 
of the coaches and the members 
of the team. Those who are in a 
position to know the relative mer
its of each of the players will 
have the responsibility of select
ing the most deserving man.
The members of the trophy 
committee hope to have the tro
phy in their possession in suffi
cient time to permit its display 
for several weeks before the Win
ter Carnival Dance at which the 
presentation is to be made.
the Frostburg goalie did a nice 
job and prevented further dam
age for the rest of the period.
The Professors finally started to 
make things more even in the 
second quarter, and the Tartans 
soon found that the going was be
coming rougher. Both teams 
fought each other to a standstill 
during the first part of the period. 
Then Hart, Tartan center-forward, 
who never played with the squad 
until he got into the game proved 
he is going to be one of the Tech 
mainstays by teaming with Mel
lott and King in a beautiful pass
ing exhibition to bring the ball 
into the heart of the visitors goalarea. Hart smacked one through 
to give the Tartans a 2-0 edge 
midway in the quarter.
Frostburg was far from through, 
however, and the visitors bounced 
right back and had a goal of their 
own almost immediately, as their 
center-forward, Bohren, put his 
cranium on a corner kick and 
sent the ball into the goal.
Mellott, Tech captain, who was 
the bright spot for Tech all after
noon, gave the Skibos their twogoal advantage again when he 
took a pass in front of the Frost
burg goal and stuffed it past the 
goalie for the third tally. The 
Teachers came right back down 
the field but magnificent defend
ing by the Tartan fullbacks held 
them at bay for the rest of the 
period and the half ended 3-1, 
Tech.
After sparring around at the 
outset of the third stanza, the 
visitors got themselves back into 
the ball game as they were award
ed a penalty kick and their cap
tain, Stowell, made it good. Again 
the Tartans were not to be out
done, and Mellott beat the Frost
burg defense once more from a 
free-for-all in front of the goal 
to make the count 4-2, at the end 
of the third period.
The fourth stanza had every
thing to be asked as both teams 
started to get their second wind. 
Gordy Holmes, also one of the 
new starters in the line-up, put 
his foot in the right place at the 
right time to give the home team 
another score midway in the peri
od. Frostburg, not to be outdone, 
came right back and pressed the 
Tech defense until the latter gave 
up a goal  Kroll scoring. Mellot got his third talley of the day 
when he made good a penalty 
kick to wind things up as far as 
scoring was concerned. The game 
ended a few minutes later with 
the score Carnegie 6, Frostburg 3.
The respective captains of the 
two teams were easily the out
standing players on the field, Mel
lott for the Tartans, and Stowell 
for the visitors. Abraham, Kind
blom and McGee also turned hi 
sterling games for the Skibos.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 02, l4
* * THE CARNEGIE PLAID * *
Page Edited by Evening School Students of Carnegie Institute of Technology
ZdUtoxicil
The first issue of THE PLAID 
for the fall semester usually goes 
unnoticed by countless numbers 
of the new evening students, not 
aware of its existence, and be
cause the copies are exhausted 
and absent from their stands by 
the end of the week. Fortunately, 
this year, The Plaid is being 
mailed to the individual student.
We, of The Plaid staff, are 
admittedly pleased, for although 
the paper was long ago mailed 
out, wartime drop in enrollment, 
simultaneously affecting the Eve
ning Student Council finances, 
curtailed this plan and not until 
last spring was the practice once 
more considered. From a great 
deal of effort on the part of Ches
ter Biscup, past president of the 
Evening Student Council, and its 
members, the suggestion was sub
mitted to the Dean, and became 
active for the fall semester.
The Plaid was born of the 
diligence and efforts of Edward 
McDonald, Jimmy Leindecker, 
Earl McGannon, and some of the' 
other more early students in the 
evening school, in the late twen
ties, and has served under count
less editors. The primary purpose 
of the establishment of The 
Plaid has remained its aim 
throughout the years; to act as a 
medium between the student body 
and faculty, to inform the student 
of events and personalities on the 
campus, and the social activities 
purposely planned for the eve
ning student.
Behind it lies its faithful sup
porter, the Evening Student Coun
cil. Many upon first observance 
have gained the impression that 
these two organizations were 
tightly controlled by a certain 
small group. This conception is 
quite possible, but upon close ob
servation, it could be explained 
in this manner:
Appearing two or three, even 
four nights a week for long class
es after a hard days work is 
bound to be quite difficult and 
tiring. Consequently, few feel they 
can spare the time and effort to 
work with these organizations. 
Those who turn out year after 
year do so not only from their 
loyalty, but because they have 
gained new and valuable friend
ships and a reward of knowing 
their efforts prove fruitful.
There are numerous spots for 
the student who would be inter
ested in working with these 
groups and new blood is always 
welcomed. Any member of the 
Council or of The Plaid staff will 
be glad to help you find your 
way over to the Carnegie Union 
and The Plaid office.
First Tech Nighter 
Time Of Your Life
The first play of the season to 
be presented by the Drama De
partment will be a William Sarayon play entitled Time Of Your 
Life.
As these plays are part of the 
drama students training, the stu
dent body is admitted by present
ing a ticket, which can be secured 
free of charge in room 132A, the 
Registrars Office.
To many of you who have taken 
advantage of these delightful pro
ductions and to all new evening 
students on campus, we remind 
you to keep the play in mind for 
an evening of sure entertainment.
The dates for Time Of Your 
Life have not yet been posted, 
but we will have this informa
tion for you in the next issue of 
the Plaid.
Fools names like fools faces, 
are always seen in public. Did 
you ever write your name on the
.............................? With registering
and rushing around for the be
ginning of classes and meeting so 
many old friends, I failed to run 
across an old classmate of mine, I 
wonder, Has anyone here seen 
KILROY! ! ! For a man who gets 
around as much as he does, I 
should think that one of you 
would have come in contact with 
CLEM to hear of his whereabouts. 
... or didnt he register yet?
Joe Rymar, who was our cap
able editor two years ago, is now 
residing in Buffalo. He left this 
beautiful Metropolis around 
Christmas, and has been seen oc
casionally on week ends visiting 
friends and relatives.
To show that our P & D stu
dents can climb the ladder, Ann 
Rawlings is now a fashion illus
trator for i \Penn Traffic Depart
ment store . Tohnstown.
We were glc )o hear from Fred 
Vichich, who was previously on 
our staff. He received his degree 
in Mechanical Engineering last 
spring and is now working for the 
Ansco Company in Endicatt, New 
York.
Prof. Seigfried, who was head of 
the printing department here, is 
greatly missed as he has returned 
to Syracuse University and is in 
charge of their Graphic Arts De
partment.
By the way if you hear that 
sweet music coming from the Arts 
Building, it is the Symphony Or
chestra practicing.
With all the problems facing 
the public today  meat shortag
es, strikes, street-cars not run
ning, merchandise hard to obtain 
 we still had a record breaking 
crowd join the Institute for reg
istration for evening classes. Even 
though the dimout caused sev
eral local schools to close, Tech 
with its own power plant operated 
at full capacity enabling students 
to register at the set time.
Good Ole Tech!
After an enforced vacation, via 
Uncle Sam, I have finally return
ed to my good old alma mater for 
some book thumping. Most of the 
old faces seem to have disappear
ed into the unknown or some
where. They certainly dont seem 
to be around, at any rate. Anoth
er fact that has struck home is 
the quantity if not the quality of 
the students who have enrolled. 
Where are all the guys? Have 
they all become worried and lost 
interest in book larnin? I hope 
not.
Who stole the Hut? It may have 
been an eyesore to some people, 
but it gave me a comfortable feel
ing in my stomach as I slowly 
tramped my way up the cut. I 
hope that some building will soon 
be erected on the site, so that my 
stomach can again settle back into 
its proper place.
Do you know, the trees are 
starting to grow up along the cut? 
Isnt that swell! There is nothing 
like a few trees to make one feel 
at home. More and better trees is 
my motto. How about it?
Most important of all, it was 
pleasant to see some of the old 
profs at registration and pass a 
few pleasantries with them. Meet
ing and talking with them took 
the edge off the homecoming and 
made all seem right with the 
world!
Ah yes! Back at good ole Car
negie Tech.
New Study Hall .
Something new has been add
ed
Yes. gang, the evening school 
has finally come through and 
moved into the sheet metal shop 
wing of Industries Hall. The sec
tion has been cut up into several 
rooms, one of which will be oc
cupied by Dale McKelway, The 
Evening School Registrar. Room 
132A will be the center of his 
bailiwick.
WOW, we now have a study 
room. Yes! Number 132 D, newly 
painted and nicely furnished can 
now become the hangout for the 
evening school men and women 
before classes. No more loafing in 
the halls, and holding up the 
walls, just comfortable chairs (ha! 
ha!) which are conducive to brain 
work. What do you say we take 
advantage of this leisure resort 
and patronize it. Remember Room 
132D, Industries Hall, for com
fortable study.

and so forth. But progressives 
want to strengthen private enter
prise, and to carry out govern
ment programs through private 
enterprise. Above all, they abhor 
the stand-pat attitude of the Old 
Guard second only to the Demo
crats.
Republicans Face Vital Policy 
Problem this Election
Warren and Stassen are keenly 
interested in which way the Re
publicans will go. To both it ap
pears that a move toward reaction 
is an effort to walk crabwise back 
to the past, and would destroy 
the Republican Party. Warren has 
even indicated that he may bolt 
the GOP if the Taft-Bricker group 
wins out. At any rate Stassen and 
Warren are very important to the 
Republicans, since western Re
publicans are predominantly pro
gressive.
Public opinion polls indicate a 
Republican victory in Congress 
this year. The question is what 
they will do with this victory. 
Republicans have two alterna
tives: they can make their party a 
peoples party, or send it back to 
the dodo.
Notice To Vets
No doubt many of the veterans 
who are in attendance at Car
negie Techs Evening School have 
encountered some problems con
nected with their school and 
veteran status. For the benefit of 
these students, a representative of 
the Veterans Administration will 
be in Room 144, Industries Hall, 
every Monday evening between 
7:00 and 9:00. This representative 
will be able to help the veteran 
with such matters as correct pro
cedures in applying for furlough 
pay and many of the other tech
nical questions which may arise in 
his mind.
You, as a veteran, are most wel
come and urged to take advantage 
of the opportunity of discussing 
your veterans status with this 
representative.
Q. How long is a second?
A. Sometimes its 3% YEARS
One second is not always one-sixtieth of a minute not in tele* 
phone mathematics. Suppose, for example, you find a new method 
that clips just one second from the time it takes to process a toll 
ticket. Then apply that saving throughout the Bell System where 
some 115,000,000 toll tickets are handled a month. The time saved 
every thirty days equals 3% years!
Important? From seemingly minor changes or savings frequently 
come the major improvements which mean better working conditions 
for telephone men and women and better telephone service for 
everyone.
In this industry, even long established methods of operation are 
never considered beyond improvement. For men with ideas and 
ability, that viewpoint is a stimulating challenge.
