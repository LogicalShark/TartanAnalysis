Scotch and Soda club members were on the verge of tears 
from too much laughing at the preview of the new show, Too 
Much. Bob Larimer is shown playing one of his new songs while 
Joe Simmons (right) does the vocals.
SnS Too Much Wows 
Audience At Preview
Broad smiles greeted Scotch and Sodas previewing of its 1950 
show, Too Much. A script reading and three of the thirteen tunes 
in the review were presented to the people who had gathered in the 
Carnegie Inn Sunday afternoon. ?
Bob Larimer and Joe Weinreich 
wrote most of the show: Larimer 
writing the music and Weinreich 
the scripts. Fred Price and Lari
mer collaborated on one skit, 
while Phil Flad (the mad profes
sor of last years show) authored 
another.
Too Much will be a review 
show with two acts and eleven 
scenes. It will run - about two 
hours and will include a variety 
of numbers. Songs will range 
from ballads to operatic arias; 
dancing will be both ballet and 
modern. Skit plots run from takeoffs on campus personalities to a 
magician act.
Singing, dancing and acting 
tryouts will be held on Saturday 
and Sunday, January 7, 8.
Singing and dancing auditions 
will be held on Saturday from 3 
to 5 in the Fine Arts building. 
Vocalists should report to room 
107, and dancers to the large ex
hibition room. Acting tryouts 
be heard the following day from 
2 to 5 in the round-table-room.
More calls will be made later 
for musicians, and production 
workers.
SC Election Set Ahead 
To January 10 and 11
to an all-school Christmas assembly December 13 between 
12:30, Student Council was forced to change the date of 
to January 10 and 11.
the absence of president 
Bob Sinclair, could maintain the 
required quorum of 18 members 
necessary to do business for only 
25 minutes last Wednesday. Points 
and keys committee chairman 
Sally Hutchinson presented a re
quest- from Pan-Hellenic council 
asking councilmen to coordinate 
the points given men and women 
for activities.
Fund Appropriated 
The policy of having the polls 
at Margaret Morrison, Adminis
tration Hall, and Skibo open Tues
day, and a poll in Skibo open on 
Wednesday to accommodate stu
dents not having Tuesday classes, 
will be used for the January 
Council elections. The deadline 
for petitions is this Friday.
In order to maintain the Deans 
emergency fund financed by Stu
dent Council, $75 was appropri
ated so that it would remain ac
tive. Students who need a quick 
loan for a few weeks may make 
arrangements with the Dean. 
Lately there was a rush on the 
fund, and it was reduced to almost 
nothing.
Sorority To Be Honored 
Planning to award a cup to the 
years outstanding sorority, PanHellenic council asked Council to 
revise some of the points now in 
effect and award some to partici
pants in Campus Chest, Womens 
Athlete association, Tarquans, and 
Rifle club.
Petitions for office in the Class 
of 1952 are due December 16 in 
the Dean of Mens office according 
to class reorganization chairman 
Ted Goodson. Their organization 
will be identical to the Class of 
1953s following the election Jan
uary 17.
The financial x-eport of the first 
showed a profit of $50. 
there was extra advertising 
from fraternities and a rush for a 
copy of the initial issue, Council 
thought it doubtful that the mag
azine would stay out of the red at 
its present rate.
Election Notice
- The Student Council election 
scheduled for Tuesday and Wed
nesday, December 13 and 14, has 
been postponed until Tuesday 
and Wednesday, January 10 and
11. Polls will be open and sit
uated as previously announced 
in the Tartan.
Certified candidates will not 
be announced until the Decem
ber 13 issue of the Tartan.
Postponement has been made 
necessary by school policy which 
does not permit any other stu

Pan-Hell Dance 
On Saturday 
In Mens Gym
Pan-Hellenics annual girl-askboy semi-formal will be held this 
Saturday in the mens gym from 
nine to one oclock. Bill LeRoy 
will play for the two hundred and 
fifty couples who are expected to 
attend this closed' affair. *
Dance proceeds will go towards 
Pan-Hell's scholarship award 
which this year went to Mary Lou 
Bacon.
Decorations for the dance, in 
keeping with the season, will fol
low a Christmas theme. Details 
are to be kept secret from the ac
tives by the hard-working pledges 
who are putting up the decora
tions.
The dance was planned and 
worked out by Pan-Hell social 
chairman Frances Hamborsky, 
Hilda Chottiner, and representa
tives from each sorority.
350 Couples 
Attend S & Bs 
Military Ball
Linda Cowan was crowned hon
orary Regimental Colonel and 
Nick Simcic was awarded the Joe 
Pash Memorial trophy at inter
mission of the Scabbard and Blade 
Military ball last Saturday night 
in Skibo gymnasium.
The two events were the fea
ture of the dance, which was at
tended by nearly 350 couples. It 
proved to be one of the outstand
ing social events of the year.
Court Of Three
Miss Cowan, who was elected 
honorary Colonel by the students 
in ROTC, had a court of three: 
Catherine Murphy, regimental ex
ecutive officer, Lynn Gasche, lieu
tenant colonel commander of 2nd 
battalion.
Jack Collins, president of Phi 
Kappa fraternity which sponsors 
the Pash award, presented Nick 
Simcic the trophy for the second 
consecutive year. The varsity 
players and coaches voted the 
most valuable player award to 
Simcic at their annual banquet at 
the PAA last Tuesday evening. 
It was the first -time that a player 
had ever received the trophy two 
years in a row.
60-Point Favorite
Collins read a statement from 
Baker which lauded Simcic as 
our chief offensive threat all 
season and who was sorely missed 
by the team when he wasnt in 
the game. Besides being Car
negies leading ground gainer dur
ing the past season, Simcic was 
one of the top scorers in the state 
with 60 points.
Scabbard and Blade also called 
the following men at intermission: 
Erwin Blosser, Paul Oflfermarm, 
Leland Greene, Leroy Bergstrom, 
Samuel Brooks, Myron Hardy,

Steubenville, Lawrence 
Bow To Tartan Squad
By Bruce Updike
Carnegie Techs basketball 
quintet came from behind to down 
a favored Lawrence Tech team 
last Friday by a score of 66-53. 
Trailing 35-29 at the half, the 
Tartan offensive rolled into high 
gear in the next two periods as 
Joe Matsey and Jack Riehl slipped 
past the Lawrence Tech defenders 
for a number of shots.
In the first quarter the home 
team sank five of their first eight 
shots and moved into a big 12-0 
lead. The Plaid team, unfamiliar 
with glass back boards, had 
trouble finding the hoop through
out the first half.
Stepler Stopped
The Tartan defense worked 
very smooth after the first open
ing minutes; Jim Stepler, Law
rence Techs giant center and 
high scorer, was held scoreless 
while Blaine Denning and Barney 
Ptty were able to get but ten 
points apiece.
Center Mike Theodore control
led both back boards for the Plaid 
and tallied 13 points. Jack Riehl

An Answer
In the last issue of the Tartan, Rufus Short, a 
graduate printer, asked someone to define spirit. 
Mr. Short also implied another question probably 
much more important but much easier to answer: 
why should the student body have spirit?
Spirit is not an easy word to define because 
it is a symbol rather than a tangible object. It 
is a symbol of enthusiasm, faith, and desire to 
make any action contribute to the success of 
some undertaking. We say it is a symbol of 
faith and enthusiasm, for without faith in an 
activity in which a person is engaged, there 
will be no enthusiasm, no desire to become suc
cessful, thus no spirit to act.
Maybe we have failed to produce a workable 
or practical definition of spirit but we believe 
everyone has made his own definition subcon
sciously at least. Therefore wre do not believe 
our lack of Websteronian ability is as serious 
as the need to explain why the student body 
needs spirit.
Mr. Short gave us a good start when he said 
that he hollered and raised general hell (one, 
although not the most useful demonstration of 
spiritEd.) because it was simply fun. Mr. 
Short arrives at the right conclusion, but we be
lieve he has used reversed reasoning to do so. 
He impiies it is fun to display spirit; we believe 
any activity is fun if a person has Spirit.
However, most people at some time or other 
in their lifetime place success in some under
taking above having fun, and this is where the 
purpose of spirit is the greatest. To us it is the 
key to success.
History gives us example after example of peo
ple who overcame seemingly insurmountable ob
stacles to achieve something they wanted and 
had to fight for. We do not have to look far for 
one example of success and the motto which was 
the driving force. My heart is in the work is 
only another way of saying I have the spirit to 
do anything.
But perhaps it is still not evident why a stu
dent, as a student, should have spirit in what he 
does. The student who does not have spirit for 
his school, both academically and otherwise, will 
probably not have spirit for his job either be
cause he will have never had the opportunity to 
know how encouraging it can be. Doing a job 
as well as it can be done and then making an 
attempt to do it better is another habit that is an 
outgrowth of spirit. As a habit it must be learned 
and the sooner the better. An employer probably 
interprets it not as spirit but as responsibility. 
Like the rose by any other name, it still smells 
as sweetly.
If spirit is a good thing, is the Carnegie Tech 
student doomed to failure because he has none? 
Is it the student's fault that he has none? 
These were other questions posed by Mr. Short 
hi his letter to us.
To the first, all we can say is we hope not; 
however, we are sure we would go much farther 
if he had spirit. To the second, we must ay we 
are not sure. A certain amount of the fault lies 
w'ith the student because he makes no attempt 
to investigate the worthiness of the opportunity 
before him. The greater fault lies with the per
son, and the administration is included in this 
category, who demands spirit, or its derivitive re
sponsibility, to his cause but yet makes no at
tempt to demonstrate its value as an undertaking.

Students Deplore 
Spirit At Rally
Editor, the Tartan:
Student Councils post season football rally was 
a dismal flop. However, its lack of success was 
not Councils fault. They did everything in their 
power to make the affair a success, including 
bringing the rally to the students when the stu
dents wouldnt go to the site of the rally.
The fact that the students did not show up at 
the gym, where the rally was scheduled origi
nally, may be excused because of the lack of 
publicity that could be drummed up at the last 
minute. However, no excuse can be found for the 
lack of interest at Skibo, where the rally finally 
ended up.
Bridge More Important
There, few students set aside their lunches, 
newspapers, or cards to help celebrate our vic
torious grid season and honor the team and 
coaches. Some looked in utter disbelief at the 
entire proceedingsthey probably never knew 
Carnegie Tech had a band} let alone a football 
team.
The four Tech students who expressed con
tempt because the band played so loud they could 
not hear each others bridge bids was the bitter 
climax. I have been kicking myself to this day 
that I did not turn over their table. Perhaps a 
slight riot might have been in order. Certainly 
nothing else except fire would have distracted 
them.
Spirit Is Dead
Many students will say So what. To them 
and the others who sat in Skibo trying hard to 
notice the whole affair less they be classed as 
silly, emotional college boys, I say, enroll in a 
correspondence courseyoull get as much out 
of it as you now do here. Im afraid this applies 
to most of the student body, for if the rally was 
any decent indication, we can conclude spirit is 
dead in the student body. It will probably stay 
dead in them for the rest of their lives.
Sincerely yours,
H. Justine Davison

John K. Shear 
Gives Lecture
Architecture Program 
Set For 4:30 Friday
Phi Kappa Phi will sponsor an 
illustrated lecture by Professor 
John Knox Sh?ar, head of the 
department of architecture, on 
Friday, December 9, at 4:30 p. m. 
The lecture, to be held in MMCC 
103, will present The Philosophy 
and Development of Contempor
ary Architecture.
Strong Convictions 
Professor Shear, who became 
department head last summer, has 
a forward-looking philosophy of 
architecture. I do not believe 
there is such a thing as modern 
style, said Professor Shear, em
phasizing his strong convictions 
which are not always consistent 
with popular ideas.
A 38 graduate of CIT, he ob
tained his Master of Fine Arts at 
Princeton. Professor Shear, who 
is in his third year in the capacity 
of a faculty member here, is also 
a member of Phi Kappa Phi.
Two Fold Objective 
The society is open to the upper 
10 per cent of the graduating class 
in any department of study, and 
honorary faculty and administra
tive persons. Phi Kappa Phi, 
founded in 1897, has a two-fold 
objective  emphasis of scholar
ship and the furnishing of an ad
ditional tie between alumni and 
the alma mater.
Present plans consist of organ
izing lectures of general interest 
perhaps music and art in the fu
ture. According to the President, 
Professor Edward Saibel, lectures 
are open to all interested persons 
and are free of charge. Refresh
ments will be served after the 
meetings.
Beginning Thursday, December 8, the drama department will 
present Hippolytus, a Greek play by Euripides. The presentation 
will be the Leighton Rollins adaption written strictly for the Amer* ican Theatre.
Hippolytus will be directed 
by Dr. John Reich, who has had 
extensive experience in the the
atre both here and abroad. In 
this country, Dr. Reich helped de
velop the Ithaca Theatre depart
ment, worked in movies and tele
vision, staged plays in the Dra
matic Workshop of the New 
School, Columbia and New York 
Universities, and the Berkshire 
Festival, and helped to build the 
graduate theatre department at 
Smith College. Last year Dr. 
Reich staged several plays for the 
American Experimental Theatre, 
including Hippolytus.
Love vs. Personality 
Hippolytus is the first play 
known to deal with sexual pas
sion. It shows the conflict be
tween passion and spiritual devo
tionthe unchallengeable rule of 
love over human personality. 
Euripides was the first Greek 
tragedian to abandon the tradi
tional theme of .general passions, 
concerned with blind suffering 
humanity, in favor of individual 
human passions.
Though the play was first en
acted in 428 B.C., the modern pre
sentation lays the scene in the 
Cretan period, around 1250 B.C. 
The change was made because the 
adapter felt that the costumes and 
sets of this period were closer to 
the present day than were those at 
the time that the play was first 
presented.
Modern Parallel 
Although the play is not a 
classic drama, it was felt that the 
problems and emotions of that 
time were much like those of to
day. Thus the play, while not 
written to teach a moral, has 
something to say about modern 
day problems.
Especially composed music used 
in the play was written by Ned 
Rorem, one of the greatest of the 
rising young American composers.
Having prominent roles in Hip
polytus are Yale Wexier in the 
title role, Collette Crawford as 
Phaedia, Angela Paton, as Phaedias nurse, and James Madison 
as Theseus.
The play will run through De
cember 15 with one matinee on 
December 9.RIT! H !2CIORA!IR

Two things every
college man should know !
Jm* This is a prom trotter. All she needs 
for a weekend is a hop, sip, and a chump.

oor. 1949, The Manhattan Shirt Co.
Taking up where their gridiron counterparts left off, Mel Cratsley's basketeers have come on the local athletic scene with a flourish 
that bids fair warning to future opponents.
Scoring more points in one game than any other Carnegie team 
in history, the current crop of sharp shooters made short work of 
an underdog Steubenville five in the opening contest.
Even in winning, however, there were sore spots wThich made 
their appearance at all too frequent intervals. The Scots extreme 
advantage in height and reserves were important factors in the final 
outcome. The Plaid quintet started off in high gear, but suddenly 
lost their potency after about five minutes with the result that they 
w-ere forced to go all out just before the intermission in order to re
gain the lead. In the second half, reserve manpower told the story.
Mike Theodore, billed as the star and high scorer, had trouble 
getting started and wound up with five personal fouls charged against 
him and only six points.
All these things might, of course, be attributed to opening game 
jitters. It is perhaps a good thing that Theodore picked this night to 
falter. His scoring punch will be more needed in the future.
On the bright side is the performance of freshman Tom Craig, 
who promises to be the best prospect here since before the war. The 
tall ex-East McKeesport star looked like a seasoned performer in 
his first showing under the Plaid.
The colorful Tasso Katselas, too, returned to the varsity picture 
in fine style. Bandages and all, he gave his usual consistent perform
ance. Jack Riehl and Tom Beck, who unfortunately are more or less 
taken for granted by local fans, appeared improved with another 
season's play under their belts.
The real crowd pleaser, however, was bespeckled Hilaiy Holste. 
His slow start brought doubts to the throng of onlookers, but after he 
had warmed to his task the tall, angular newcomer filled in for cap
tain Theodore in more than adequate style.
Tomorrow nights encounter with St. Vincent should mean an
other win for the Tartans. The Bearcats are rated much higher than 
their predecessors of last year, but still figure to drop this one.
Saturday's visit to Frankie Gustines Waynesburg Yellow Jackets, 
however, is another story. The Jackets are loaded with talent and 
with the added advantage of their home floor will be heavy favorites. 
An upset is almost out of the question.
Or. Baker Named Outstanding Coach
In a recent poll, International News Service named Dr. Eddie 
Baker and Villanovas Jim Leonard as the outstanding collegiate 
football coaches in Pennsylvania.
Dr. Bakers selection Was based on the sudden reversal in 
the win and loss column exhibited by his Tartan squad and 
the fact that it wras the first winning season at Carnegie since 
the de-emphasis period had set in.
The announcement was the first outside recognition that the 
doctors tremendous coaching job had received, despite the exten
sive publicity he had received at home.

garnered 15 points for high point 
honors and Joe Matsey tossed in 
14 for the winners.
Theodore Scores First
In their opening game of the 
season last Wednesday, the Tar
tans walloped an undermanned 
Steubenville College team to the 
tune of 79-44. The Plaid team set 
a terrific scoring pace early in the 
first quarter with Mike Theodore 
tallying the first goal with a shot 
from the side court. Jack Riehl 
took the ball on a hand-off from 
Theodore in the foul circle and 
scored on a layup shot. The vis
itors lost the ball as Theodore 
recovered from their board and 
passed to Bob McCullugh. McCullugh and Tom Beck quickly took 
the ball down the floor with Beck 
scoring* under the hoop. Joe Mat
sey tipped in Theodores foul at
tempt, Riehl sank a foul and Beck 
scored a goal on a shot from the 
side to give the Tartans a 11-1 
lead. However, the visitors were 
not to be completely outscored 
and, sparked by the brilliant play 
of John Stozich, cut the Plaid lead 
to 15-13 at the end of the quarter.
The second period offered the 
most exciting part of the game as 
the Steubenville charges overcame 
the Tartan lead, went ahead by 
6 points and then fell behind 32- 
29 just before the half. Neal Crain 
tallied on a snowbird and knotted 
the score for the visitors. Tony 
Gasperine converted a free throw 
and Tony Golas took a pass from

Wrestling Team Tops 
Pitt In Informal Meet
By AI Moore
1M Basketball
Entries for intramural bas
ketball teams are due at the 
intramural office, room 104, 
gymnasium building no later 
than Friday, December 9.
All interested teams should 
contact Mr. David A. See at the 
above office as soon as possible, 
before that time.
Carnegie Techs banner sports year received a boost last week 
from an unexpected source. An informal group of "spare time Tar
tan wrestlers caught the victory spirit, scored an upset mat victory, 
and did it against Techs arch rival, the University of Pittsburgh.
* Jim Semple, metallurgy junior 
from Washington, D. C., the

-i,. r /'i -, scored a victory in both Bob
Horsch followed him with i dtjF^ ^ cision victory and George Hawk - $ B ^ns> a^s0 Tech, pinned his ops J 1 I- ^JmtSrMy ponent in the final minute.
j^ ' Final score was 14-12 in favor
/' of the Plaid.
Close Decisions 
The other four matches com
prising the eight match competi
tion were won by Pitt on close de
cisions. Two of the decisions were 
racked by the Panthers first and 
second men. little more Tar
tan experience might well have 
turned the tide in each.
Wrestling is not a varsity sport 
at Tech. The athletes who com
peted against Pitt were part of a 
thirty-five man intramural pro
gram which is under the direction 
of Messrs. See and Alexander. 
There is quite a bit of experienced 
talent in the program. Under 
more ligorous training and aided 
by additional talent which exists 
on campus, the Tartans could have 
a first rate wrestling team.
Here, however, is a salute to 
th wrestling team and a well de
served spot in the sports lime
light. Its not every day that a 
Tech team wins, and over Pitt 
at that.

Arts Afternoon9 
For Freshmen 
On December 12
Arts Afternoon, inaugurated 
for the first time on campus last 
year, will again be held this year 
under the sponsorship of the Arts 
Committee of Fine Arts College.
It will take place on Monday, 
December 12, beginning in the 
Carnegie theatre at 1:30 p. m. The 
program will consist of a tour 
through all five departments of 
the college ending with an enter
tainment program in the Exhibi
tion room.
The aim of the program is to 
acquaint all Fine Arts freshmen 
and faculty from all colleges with 
the work of each department of 
the school.
Freshmen in Fine Arts will be 
excused from afternoon classes in 
order to attend.
CIT United World Federalists 
Take World Government Poll
One out of every fifteen students in the C book will be ask
ed to give his opinion on world government in a pool taken by 
Carnegie Techs chapter of the United World Federalists.
Names will be chosen at random in an alphabetical order so that a 
true cross section of the student* I 
population may be polled.
Max Kadin, sophomore archi
tect, said, We are trying to con
duct this poll as objectively as 
possible. We not only wish to get 
the students to think on the prob
lem of world government, buL-we 
also wish to determine the result 
of their thinking.

ist, and Kenneth Ward, senior 
physicist. Dr. More of the Bureau 
of Measurement and Guidance 
contributed suggestions. Other 
faculty members who contributed 
their time to make the poll possi

Lettei To The Editor
Challenge Accepted
Editor, the Plaid:
In behalf of the officers of Evening Student Council, I 
would like to take this opportunity to render appreciation for 
the expression of confidence in the Council staff that was 
voiced in your editorial of November 22. We wish to assure 
you that your confidence has not been misplaced, particularly 
if eifort and integrity are indications of Councils intent to do 
the job efficiently.
Your editorial challenged Council's ability to operate 
within the limits of its appropriation for the 1949-50 school 
year in view of the fact that a deficit was incurred in 1948-49. 
In order to close the school year with a balance after remov
ing the deficit that we inherited, every Council member is 
obliged to put forth his best efforts to obtain a large attend
ance at every function on the Social Calendar.
The attendance at the Thanksgiving Dance on a wintry 
evening that discouraged many people from driving indicated 
the amount of effort put forth to publicize the dance. It should 
be pointed out, however, that our success depends upon the sup
port of the student body. The support is steadily increasing, 
and we firmly believe that the efforts of a new group that re
cently volunteered its services will be of valuable assistance in 
the attainment of our objectives.
A challenge ordinarily induces increased effort, and if your 
comments serve to activate minds and bodies, the editorial will 
have accomplished a fruitful purpose.

Sigma Delta Phi, Evening School 
social fraternity, is to hold its most 
important social affair of the year 
Saturday eve., December 1,7, 1949. 
This annual off-campus affair will 
be held at that popular nite-spot, 
Bill Greens Casino.
The Social Committee, headed 
by Ray Schwalm, has prepared a 
splendid program, calculated to 
exceed all past performances. The

the better features of the party 
season, a Grab Bag, will be avail
able. All the ladies and gentle
men who attend will be expected 
to bring a wrapped present, re
tail value not to exceed $1.00. The 
fellows should buy with girls 
whims in mind, and the girls from 
the male point of view.
To top off the special program, 
a Christmas Tree will be in the 
midst of the celebration. All 
members of Sigma Delta Phi who 
wish to attend, should contact Ray 
Schwalm, via the convenient pen
ny postcards already mailed out. 
Remember your friends are wel

By Financial Aid To Students
Students interested in graduate study overseas are getting help 
from a special CIT comittee which is handling applications for 
overseas scholarships under the Fullbright Bill.
The committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. J. C. Warner, VicePresident of Carnegie, receives ap-4 
plications from interested students, 
and, after studying their records, 
makes recommendations to the 
government authorities who grant 
the necessary aid for foreign study 
and research.
The scholarships, which provide 
transportation, books, tuition, and 
maintenance, are available to any 
American citizen with a college 
degree or its equivalent and a 
knowledge of the language of the 
country in which he wants to 
study.
Established under the Fulbright 
Act of 1946, the scholarships 
serve the participating countries 
as a method of repaying obliga
tions to the United States without 
expending dollar reserves. More 
than 600 scholarships will be 
available next year.
Some Carnegie students are al
ready working under the bill in 
foreign research and educational 
centers.
In addition to Dr. Warner, the 
committee is composed of the 
Deans of Carnegies colleges.
Countries in which the schol
arship holders may study include 
Belgium, Luxembourg, Burma, the 
Netherlands, Philippines, Greece, 
New Zealand, France, Italy, Nor
way, Iran, and the United King
dom.
