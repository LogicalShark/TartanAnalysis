Sing ii Swing
Last Friday evening, before the 
largest crowd ever to see a Tech 
song contest, the boys from Kap
pa Sigma and the girls of Kappa 
Phi Delta walked off with the 
coveted mens and womens cups.
Bill Floyd, the Kappa Sig lead
er, put his team through a har
monious medley of fraternity 
songs centered around the 
thoughts of an alumnus as he sat 
smoking his pipe by the fireside. 
Dressed in shimmering, silver
like gowns, the Kappas won the 
womens side of the Sing with a 
unique arrangement of The 
Hawaiian War Chant sung in the 
native tongue. Under the direc
tion of Whiffy Cox they also sang 
Tales of the Vienna Woods and 
We Belong To Kappa Phi.
An Editorial
Last years April Fool issue of the TARTAN carried the 
story that several members of the faculty had been arrested by 
the F. B. I. for printing and distributing salacious literature. 
This April 2 the PITTSBURGH PRESS ran the story that 
the TARTAN staff was in dutch with the school authorities 
for printing and distributing salacious literature. Our story last 
year was April Fool, but the PITTSBURGH PRESS wasn't kid
ding.
.Many students who have heard something of the rumpus 
are still unaware of just exactly what objections could cause some 
members of Student Council to ask the immediate removal of 
the Editor of the TARTAN. Essentially, two stories were ob
jected to on the grounds of-obscenity. They were: a story on 
rationing saltpetre in the girls dorms and a story about a lab 
for the marriage relations course.
Whether these two stories are more obscene than the gen
eral run oil radio humor of Bob Hope and John Barrymore is 
seriously open to discussion. They are certainly a great deal less 
obscene than many lines out of plays which play regularly at the 
Nixon Theatre. The objection may be raised, however, that this 
type of liumor is all very well for radio programs and theatrical 
shows, but that it does not belong in a college newspaper. We 
will even grant the opposition the fact that the April Fool is
sue of the TARTAN ought not to be compared with the April 
Fool issue of other college papers because most of the other big 
colleges permit greater latitude of thought in such matters, 
whereas, Carnegie Tech sticks more closely to the Blue Laws 
Type of morality. Let us compare this issue of the TARTAN 
with other forms of humor on the Tech campus. Certainly, in 
view of the cyclonic proportions of the tempest that has been 
raised, one would expect to find this issue a great deal worse or 
at least just as bad as previous April Fool TARTANS or as 
issues of other college publications. One of the letters received 
by the Administration, as a result of the front page story in the 
PRESS expressed satisfaction that the Administration was at 
long last going to take action against the smut appearing in 
the SCOTTIE and in April Fool issues of the TARTAN. That 
brings to mind the fact that any issue of the SCOTTIE contains . 
jokes far more risque than the ones in the April Fool issue of 
the TARTAN to which objection has been raised.
Let us compare this April Fool issue of the TARTAN with 
the same of last year. In this years issue the two stories ob
jected to totaled exactly 10% inches. In last years issue of 
the TARTAN, material just as bad or a great deal worse (from 
the point of view of those objecting) totaled 37*/2 inches. Cer
tainly, in view of that, it: would only be fair to consider this 
years April Fool issue a great improvement over that of previ
ous years. Certainly, it seems rather poor judgment to attack 
the TARTAN for obscenity when the trend is obviously in the 
opposite direction.
If mentioning the use of saltpetre in the dorms or kid
ding marriage relations course for not being sexy is obscene, 
where are we tp draw the line and whom are we to punish? Mor
tar Board, senior womens honorary, among whose faculty ad
visors are some of the finest people on this campus, sponsored 
a moving picture show on exactly the same day that the TARTAN 
April Fool issue appeared. That movie show was attended by

Thistle Hall will be the scene 
tomorrow night from nine to one 
oclock of the first major dance 
sponsored by the Citcom Clan and 
open to all students at $1.00 a cou
ple. Appropriately titled  th% 
Easter Prpm, the dance will be a 
semi-formal affair, with corsages 
taboo.
Joey Sims, popular local lead
er, will bring his orchestra and 
vocalists to furnish the music. 
This aggregation is at present the 
staff orchestra of station WJAS. 
Their tempo is definitely smooth, 
and will doubtless be a welcome 
relief to Tech students who like 
their dance music on the sweet 
side.
Four of the men in the Sims 
band are from Tech. Two of 
them, Fred Whitlinger and Bernie 
Cerelli, are at present enrolled in 
the Department of Music. Norm 
Osburn attends the evening school, 
and the other Tech man is a grad
uate.
Skip Nelson, who composed 
Memoirs of Yesterday, and Fred 
Herrick are the featured vocal
ists. Another popular feature of
the Sims band is A1 Kennedys 
singing trumpet.
The chairman of the dance is 
Don Thomas, 42, Social Chairman 
of the Citcom Clan. He wishes to 
emphasize two points: first, that 
the music will be smooth, and 
second, that corsages are taboo. 
If anyone wears a corsage, it will 
be checked at the door.
Charles Krapf, 43, is chairman 
of the decorations committee. Fea
tured in the decorations will be a 
huge crystal ball, which is being 
rented specially for the occasion. 
Pastel shades of crepe paper and 
festive balloons and flowers will 
complete the background.
I. F. Council Meeting
Interfraternity Councils rush
ing booklet is definitely under 
way. It will consist of sixteen 
pages and will be sent to incoming 
freshmen during the summer. The 
rushing rules of the Council have 
been changed slightly. The chief 
difference is that men depledging, 
may not re-pledge at any house 
for a period of four months.

The Student Body deserves an 
explanation for the skimpincss of 
the present issue. On Friday after
noon the TARTAN staff was pre
pared to put out a regular six page 
issue. The haste with which some 
members of Student Council rush
ed to attempt to remove the pres
ent staff causcd a situation under 
which it was almost impossible to 
get the necessary cooperation from 
staff members to make a regular 
TARTAN possible.
Since we had serious doubts as 
to whether the TARTAN would 
be permitted to appear, we de
cided to let the present muddled 
situation clear itself before issu
ing a TARTAN of normal size 
and scope.

At a meeting held Sunday, the 
senior staff of the TARTAN vot
ed to reject the unofficial recom
mendation of Student Council to 
remove the Editor and elect a 
junior in his place. Declaring that 
no such action was justified, the 
senior staff also pointed out that 
ALL members of the TARTAN 
staff were equally involved.
The senior staff stated fur
ther that, in view of the fact 
that the action was demanded by 
certain members of the adminis
tration, the decision was not 
necessarily a reflection of student 
opinion.
Proxy Votes
At a closed meeting Saturday 
noon, Student Council voted to 
recommend that the TARTAN 
staff elect a new editor immedi
ately. As a quorum was not pres
ent, however, the action was un
official. Fifteen voting members 
constitute a quorum. There were 
present eleven voting members, 
all voting in favor of the recom
mendation. Three more affirma
tive votes were cast by proxy, 
making a total of fourteen.
The measure was adopted at 
the request of Dr. Warden, Dean 
of Students. Dr. Warden stated 
that it' suitable action was not 
taken, the matter would bo placed 
in the hands of the Administra
tion. At a previous mooting Fri
day at <1:30, Bill Floyd, president 
ol! Student Council, moved that 
Leonard Shatzkln bo advised tu 
resign as editor-in-chief ol! the 
TARTAN. As a quorum was not 
present, no vote was taken on the 
matter.
Wines Proposal
The staff, according to the Stu
dent Council recommendation*, 
would continue to work under the 
new editor. The remainder of 
next years senior staff, with the 
exception of the editor-in-chief, 
would be selected at the usual 
time.
Paul Wines made the proposal 
that was accepted by the mem
bers of Student Council who 
were present at the Saturady 
meeting. Those voting in favor of 
the recommendations were Misses 
Gillis, Williams and Dorsey; and 
Messrs. McGarvey, Jamison, 
Wills, Heilman, Lange, Jacobson, 
and Dorsheimer.

1. The Senior Editorial Staff is 
sorry it can not accept the un
official recommendation of the 
non-quorum meetings of Student 
Council on Friday and Saturday 
to remove the Editor and imme
diately elect a Junior in his place. 
Aside from the fact that there is 
not a single Junior on the staff 
whose hands are clean as far as 
the April Fool Issue of the TAR
TAN is concerned, we feel that the 
issue does not merit action of any 
drastic sort. Furthermore, in view 
of Councils previous action, when 
a committee of three was set up to 
review all printed material in the 
TARTAN, the staff believes that 
any action taken should apply 
equally to Mr. Herbert Reich and 
Mr. William Jamison, since they, 
with the Editor, are the members 
of the committee; In Our opinion, 
Student Councils unseemly haste 
in attempting to remove the Edi
tor of the TARTAN in no way re
flects the attitude of the student 
body. The excuses of certain Stu
dent Council members, that mem
bers of the Administration de
mand this aption, will not hold 
water. Student Council is sup
posed to be the representative of 
the student body. Their decisions 
should be the reflection of student 
opinion and not of the opinion of 
one or two members of the Ad
ministration.
2. The fact that no one on the 
TARTAN staff was infoi*mcd of 
the Student Council meeting of
Friday until one half hour before 
it was scheduled to start, plus the 
fact that no one but the Editor of 
the TARTAN was permitted to 
be present at that meeting and 
that all other students were ex
cluded, plus the fact that no 
member of the TARTAN staff 
was informed of the second 
meeting on Saturday from which 
all students were excluded,all 
these things are sufficient to cast 
doubt upon the actions of Student 
Council and its position as a body 
supposedly representative of stu
dent opinion.
3. Although technically the re
sponsibility for the issue in ques
tion may be entirely that of the 
Editor, the Senior Editorial Staff 
feels that unofficially, it is its re
sponsibility in just as high a de
gree. By censuring the Editor, we 
are at the same time censuring 
ourselves. We feel that we have 
done nothing to warrant censure, 
and therefore, we do not care 
to take the action recommended.
4. Members of the Senior Edi
torial Staff have been working on 
the TARTAN for four years, try
ing to make it a better newspaper 
for the campus. Recently, at
tempts have been made to make 
major issues out of everything 
that has appeared in the paper 
that is not acceptable to some 
individuals. There is a Letter to' 
the Editor column in the paper 
for complaints, and there are 
other adult ways of registering 
protest. It is not only an insult 
to the staff to have such havoc 
raised over unimportant issues, 
but it hampers us in the publica
tion of the paper to the best of 
our ability.

Merchant Marine 
Offers Employment 
To Senior Engineers
Employment opportunities for 
graduates of engineering colleges 
are now available in the maritime 
industry. The jobs fall into two 
categories: Ship operation and ship 
design. Those qualified who ap
ply to the Commission before May, 
1941, will compete for these posi
tions eariy in June.
Appointments will be made from 
this list as engineer cadets in the 
Merchant Marine. After three 
months service, a cadet can take 
another examination, this time for 
Third Assistant Engineer. After 
he has his license, an engineer can 
be appointed as a cadet officer. 
Many cadet officers are being pro
moted to licensed officer positions 
after one voyage.
The Maritime Commission' has 
initiated a training program which 
will afford a limited number of 
recent graduates of recognized en
gineering schools, the opportunity 
of receiving a one-year training 
in Marine Engineering or Naval 
Architecture. Candidates are se
lected from civil service registers, 
and are appointed on probation at 
an annual salary of $2,000.
Additional information may be 
obtained by application to the Su
pervisor of Cadet Training, Unit
ed States Maritime Commission.
Andrews Wins 
Research Prize
Dr. J. Cutler Andrews, Assistant 
Professor of History, received the 
announcement last week that he 
had been awarded a $1,000 grant 
in Aid of Research from the So
cial Science Research Council.
I-Ie is now working on a research 
project entitled A Study of Newsgathering During the American 
Civil War. The $1,000 award is 
intended to defray expenses of 
necessary research for the next 
year.
To facilitate his research work, 
Dr. Andrews expects to obtain a 
leave of absence next year. He 
has been working on the project 
intermitently during the past three 
years, and believes that, with the 
assistance of the generous grant 
he has just received, the research 
will be completed by the fall of 
J942. Most of the work will be 
done in Washington, D. C. and 
New York City.
Included in the material being 
investigated by Dr. Andrews are 
the adventures of war corres
pondents, culled from their 
memoirs, both published and un
published. When published, the 
work will also contain a discus
sion of censorship during the war.

Henry Boettcher, at the opening 
of his production of The Comedy 
of Errors last Saturday night, 
was presented with a juicy ear of 
corn on the cob. The corn must 
have been the gift of Mr. William 
Shakespeare, for the Bard had 
enough left over to start a can
nery after he had finished writing 
his Comedy (?) of Errors. Mr. 
Shakespeare was ungracious; he 
should have baked Mr. Boettcher 
a souffle and enclosed a note as 
follows: Dear Henry: I caught
the opening of your production of 
my play. I should have rewritten 
it and then thrown it away, but 
a man has to make a living. How 
did you ever do it? Regards, 
Bill.
The current Drama Department 
offering disproves the silk pursesows ear adage. The Comedy of 
Errors, with its obvious and un
funny plot mechanisms, is an 
inept and dull script; as played 
this week at the Fine Arts Thea
ter, it is engagingly riotous. The
Antipholuses and Dromios are re
freshingly enacted, although I 
preferred the artlessness of the 
boys from Syracuse (Kraus and 
Challener) to the somewhat selfconscious boys from Ephesus. Ha
zel Shermet, as Adriana, is the 
most frightening leading lady of 
the season; her expert playing 
makes a charming zany out of an 
uninteresting character. As Lu
ciana, Barbara Burns is delight
fully brainless. William Beggs 
settings, mounted on a revolving 
stage, are spontaneously decora
tive.
Staff Meeting
There will be a very important 
meeting of the TARTAN staff to
day at 4:30 in 106 Arts. It is im
perative that all members of the 
editorial staff, freshmen through 
seniors, be present. If anyone can
not attend they should leave a 
message in the TARTAN mail
box, 409, in the school postoffice 
stating where and when they can 
be reached.

For four years weve been told that we were no longer boys

faculty members who laughed uproariously at the very funny 
situations included the following:
.1. Women participating in drunken bouts.
2. Shots of women undressing.
3. A woman taking money from a man for a very obvious 
reason.
4. A woman going into a mans apartment.
5. A woman stealing a man from her daughter.
(i. Married women running around with unmarried men.
Any one of these things would cause the April Fool issue of 
the TARTAN to blush. We cannot find words to express the ef
fect of the combination of all these movie scenes. Are we then 
to take the students and faculty members who attended the 
showing of this moving picture who enjoyed it hugely and bra
zenly, the faculty advisors of Mortar Board, the members of 
Mortar Board, and put them upon the block for one great mass 
sex trial ?
We think not. Frankly, we think that the SCOTTIES jokes, 
the Mortar Board movies, and the stories in the TARTAN are 
not puite as bad as some people are trying to paint them. All 
three are having a little laugh at 1 he expense of sex, not in a 
lewd but in a good-natured way. If they offend some peoples 
sensibilities, one word is sufficient to stop it. If one single mem
ber of the faculty or student body had raised the slightest iota of 
an objection to last years issue of the TARTAN, it would have 
been sufficient to prevent the slighest trace of any thing risque 
appearing in future April Fool issues. But no one said a word. 
The TARTAN staff itself felt that last years issue had perhaps 
in certain stories gone beyond the bounds, and therefore this 
years April Fool issue was considerably toned down.
Undoubtedly, not a word would have been said about this 
issue were it not for the fact that a front page story in the 
PITTSBURGH PRESS deliberately called attention to what, in 
the opinion of the PRESS, were obscene stories. It is an obvious 
truth that you will find filth if you look for it no matter where 
you look. In our opinion the real culprit in this case is the 
person who went out of his way to interest the PRESS in mak
ing a sensational news story out of what was and is perfectly 
harmless fun, and a good deal cleaner than some of the jokes we 
have heard in classrooms.
One thing deserves repetition. While the TARTAN staff, 
which read those stories before they went into the issue (in
cidentally, the group that read these stories included freshman, 
sophomore, and junior women) feels that they gave no real 
cause for complaint, we certainly recognize the right of other 
people, people who have not read former April Fool TARTANS 
or the SCOTTIE, or people who did not see Mortar Boards 
movie, to take offense. While we recognize the right of these 
people to be injured, however, we certainly have no intention of 
injuring them. We would like to suit the TARTAN to our audi
ence, and if our audience has changed so radically from the pre
vious year, when the issue was sexier, we are perfectly willing 
never to mention sex in the TARTAN again and never to use 
words in the TARTAN which might, by some means, be con
strued to have some relation to sex. What we want is fair play. 
It is not fair play to pass up without comment campus items which 
are a groat deal more obscene, and then to pounce on the TAR
TAN for what, relative to the rest of campus humor, is good clean 
fun.

Betas Take First 
In Swimming Meet
Bill Tliimiiurst 
Leads Winners 
On To Victory
Four teams were entered in 
the intramural swimming com
petition. The two meets were run 
in interlocking fashion with the 
Betas and Citcom Clarf swim
ming first and the Kappa Sigs 
and D. U.s second.
In the Beta-Citcom meet, the 
Betas won the 100 yard relay 
with Lange, Thunhurst, Curry, 
and Lacher swimming. The div
ing event netted the Betas anoth
er first and also a third, but the 
Citcoms took a second. Betas 
King won the 50 yard backstroke. 
Thunhurst of the Betas won the 
25 yard freestyle and also the 50 
yard freestyle. The Betas won 
this meet very easily. This was 
probably due to their extensive 
practice, and undoubtedly to the 
amount of aquatic talent. The 
score was 34 to 14.
The Kappa Sigs and D. U.s tied 
their meet with a score of 24 to 
24. Kappa Sigma started off with 
a victory in 100 yard relay. The 
D. U.s won the diving event eas
ily since K. S. had no divers
and had to put in John Lindberg 
to even take a third place. Cy 
Herre of the D. U.s won the 25 
yard freestyle, but Kappa Sigma 
came back with a hands-down 
victory in the 50 yard backstroke. 
In the 50 yard breast stroke Bill 
Floyd and John Lindberg took 
first and second places. The D. 
U.s won the last event, the 50 
yard freestyle to tie the score.
In view of the unusual cir
cumstances, a triple meet was 
arranged for the final event, with 
the Betas, the Kappa Sigs, and 
the D. U.s competing. Kappa 
Sigma took the 100 yard relay for 
the opening event, but the Betas 
and the D. U.s distributed the 
diving points among themselves 
with Lange taking first, Tilton 
second, and Powell third. In the 
25 yard freestyle Thunhurst of 
the Betas took first and Herre of 
the D. U.s took second. Floyd 
and Spangler took first and sec
ond for the Kappa Sigs in the 
backstroke. Lange took first place 
in the breaststroke for the Betas 
and Lindberg came in second for 
the Kappa Sigs. Thunhurst took 
another first for the Betas in the 
50 yard freestyle to cinch the 
meet for the tea drinkers. The 
final score was: Betas 23; Kappa 
Sigs, 17; and D. U.s 8.
W. A. A. NEWS
 By BETTY PARKER -
The Penn State Conference is 
just around that same corner, and 
we want you all to be thinking 
about going. Of course, you cant 
all go, but nine lucky gals will be 
in on that week-end. The dele
gates who went last year are still 
talking about the fun (and incidently, the benefits) of that Penn 
State Conference. So, be thinking 
about it, and sign the notices on 
the W. A. A. board when they 
appear, and well do the choos
ing and tell you who is to go.
Conferences are a sign of 
spring, or spring a sign of con
ferences. But anyway, both are
here. Another conference in Cal
ifornia, Pa., at the State Teachers 
College is coming up in a week 
or so. Look for the details and 
notices of this one also.
And in Spring, a young girls 
fancy turns to love and tennis 
courts. The board has nothing to 
do with the supply of the first, 
but there are tennis courts for all 
the nice weather activity. The 
courts are being marked off and 
repaired for spring, and we ex
pect all you enthusiasts to be out

Beginners, experienced, and ex

According to the present plans 
of the Intramural Board, the 1941 
softball season will commence 
next Tuesday. Twenty-two teams 
have entered competition: twelve 
fraternities and ten independent 
teams. This is a decrease in the 
total number of teams from last 
year, there being twelve fratern
ity teams and fourteen independ
ent aggregations in the previous 
leagues. Four leagues will be 
formed, six fraternity teams in 
two of them and five independent 
teams in the others.
The schedule will only run one 
month, until May 15, since Sen
ior exams begin on that date, and 
all games should be completed by 
that date. The winners of the two 
fraternity leagues will play one 
semi-final and the two independ
ent winners will battle in the oth
er. This promises to be a hard 
fought year and the competition 
in all four leagues will be very 
keen.
Tartan Matmen 
Win in Competition

During the past week, the In
tramural wrestlers of old Car
negie journeyed to Wilmerding, 
Pa., where they grappled with the 
matmen of the Wilmerding Y. M. 
C. A. The men selected to repre
sent Carnegie were chosen from 
the group that had shown some 
interest in the efforts of their 
tutor, Paul Brown, and seemed 
to be the best qualified to repre
sent our. school in any competi
tion.
In the first event of the even
ing, L. S. Frost lost to his oppon
ent in the 135 pound class. The 
following Tartan matman came 
away with a win over his adver
sary in the 145 pound division, 
this stalwart being W. J. Reid. 
Reid Byers bumped his man into 
submission to win in the 165 
pound division, and Fattso 
Dominy rolled all over his vic
tim to score a final win in the 
heavyweight division.

The Intramural Bowling Leagues 
rolled the last of the scheduled 
matches April 5, with the first 
honors going to the PiKAs of 
league A, and to the Citcom Clan 
of the B league. Although the 
winner of the first group was a 
bit in doubt before the last 
matches, it is not surprising 
to see the PiKAs win. They got 
off to a fair start and improved 
week by week. The Delts seemed 
to lose their '"oomph at the very 
end, as did the Betas.
The Citcom Clan took their
league in good style, although the 
Tau Delts moved steadily up to 
fall just short of the crown.
The standing of each team is as 
follows:

Dr. Baker Ends 
Spring Practice 
For Grid Squad
Coach Eddie Baker announced 
last week that spring practice 
had been terminated for the 
year. This move was undertaken 
due to the fact that a major por
tion of the men with football 
ability were unable to attend the 
regularly scheduled practices and 
also because there were not 
enough men in playing togs to 
provide a good scrimmage.
Most of the regulars from last

the Sports Staff, an all-opponent 
Intramural Basketball team has 
been formed. The selections have 
been made on the basis of sug

team, and the results have been 
tabulated by the staff. Leading 
in the selections are the winning 
S. A. E. team who have placed 
two men on the first team and 
two more on the second. The po
sitions are as follows:

Scholarship Fund 
Will Be Enlarged
On Saturday evening, April 26, 
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity is 
planning to hold its Spring Robert 
B. Leighou Memorial Scholarship 
Dance in Thistle Hall. The dance 
is a regular semi-annual event of 
the fraternity sponsoring the 
scholarship fund which is one of 
the major projects of the or
ganization.
The committee and officers in 
charge of the party are working 
to have this dance one of the most 
successful ones of the year. A 
commitee is interviewing prom
inent orchestras in order to make 
a selection which it is hoped will 
please all the dancers. The name 
of the band will be announced 
later.
The assessment for the dance is 
one dollar per couple and ail stu
dents of Carnegie Tech and their 
friends are welcome to attend. All 
the proceeds derived are devoted 
towards the Scholarship Fund 
which the fraternity is sponsoring.
Nu Sigma Alpha is an evening 
school honorary fraternity pro
moting interest on the campus in 
the extra - curricular activities 
which are offered the evening stu
dents who register at Carnegie 
Tech. Membership is offered stu
dents who show interest in these 
affairs. The officers of the fra
ternity are John Thomas, Precep
tor; James H. Miller, Mentor; 
Steve Marcininzyn, Recorder; and 
Harold E. Park, Warden.
John A. DeLuca represents the 
Students of the Evening College 
of Fine Arts on the Evening Stu
dent Council as Vice President of 
their group. Although this is his 
first year as a member of Coun. . . k.93 Do fC:2TE
cil, he has been an ardent work
er for the past several years. Last 
year, he was awarded the Even
ing Student Council Activities 
Scholarship for his participation in 
campus activities. He is also the 
proud bearer of two Evening Stu
dent Council Activities Awards 
and a member of the Nu Sigma 
Activities Honorary Fraternity 
since the summer of 1939.
John is twenty years old and 
was born and raised in Pitts
burgh. He attended Westinghouse High School where he fol
lowed the Academic Course of 
studies. At Westinghouse, he was 
an active member of the gym team 
for four years. He was graduated 
from high school in 1937. Upon 
his graduation, he started his 
studies at Tech. He is registered 
in the Department of Architecture 
of the College of Fine Arts, and 
expects to receive his certificate 
in Architecture in 1942. Having al
ready attended classes five nights a 
week in previous years, he is 
carrying a double schedule this 
year.
During the day, John is employ
ed by Marks, Fisher, and Simboli, 
Registered Architects, as a drafts-, 
man.
John is particularly partial to 
brunettes and is almost tied down, 
but he. is still available. He also 
likes to play sandlot baseball, 
mushball, dance, and swim during 
the little spare time he has left.
According to reports received 
from our intricate spy system, Day 
School Student Council is going to 
sabotage our good paper. In other 
words they may try to suppress 
the information which we are re
laying to the students. In case 
anything should come of this ru
mor we will be forced to distrib
ute our news to all you guys by 
means of yellow leaflets or oral 
grape vine.
It certainly must be tough to 
get news when our fine papers 
must pick up stories from an 
April Fool issue of a college 
publication to fill up space. We 
are not saying that we support the 
stories or think they are the type 
which should appear in a college 
paper, but we do feel that the type 
and purpose of the paper should 
be considered.
Of course it may be that with 
elections coming up Student Coun
cil may feel safer with such an 
unknown quantity as the present 
Editor out of office. Be that as it 
may, the night students depend on 
the Plaid for their news of cam
pus events. The success of their 
affairs depends on the amount of 
publicity they get through this 
medium. We pay for our page 
and naturally enough we expect 
to get to use it without having to 
worry about whether or not the 
students will get to read the stories 
we write, every time there is a 
little controversy between the day 
groups. They should be able to 
settle their little disputes like 
adults instead of saying: If I 
cant be Captain Im going home. 
Lets have more cooperation.
An old friend of ours came back 
tonight, Arnold Anex. Hes a lit
tle paler and a little thinner, but 
hes still Anex and we were glad 
to see him back again. 
We noticed that another of the 
old engineers, Frank Carrol, gave 
a big diamond to his gal friend, 
Audrey, an ex-Willcinsburg gal.
The boys who attended the Nu 
Sigma Alpha smoker last week 
are all raving about the moving 
pictures of the Steel Mill which 
were shown.
There will be no paper next 
week, so we wont need all you 
workers here, but dont forget to 
come back the next week.
All the fellows are asking their 
wives and gals for their freedom 
on May 3. Thats the date of the 
Engineers Banquet., and just 
everyone goes. Tickets will be
