formed of the action by members 
of the Scottie staff, Wiley was 
given no official notification, and 
what he knew of the expected 
move he had gathered from vari
ous sources.
Said he, Resignations from the 
staff, particularly en masse, and 
in the manner in which they ap
pear to be carrying them out, are 
unjustified.
A letter, addressed to Scottie 
readers, will appear in the De
cember issue of the magazine, 
which Evans hopes will be out 
tomorrow, explaining the reasons 
for the mass resignation as being 
primarily objections to action of 
the review board. In addition, 
Evans will appear before Student 
Council this afternoon to more 
fully explain his stand.
Speaking for himself and ,his 
staff, Evans told the Tartan that 
the difficulties brought on by the 
review board make us feel that 
we cannot accept the responsibil
ity of continuing to publish the 
magazine.
The members of the board, 
he claimed, dont have a mature 
enough outlook and dont under
stand the purpose of a humor 
magazine.
[The review board was insti
tuted by Student Council follow
ing the criticism by the adminis
tration of the September 1948 is
sue and the withdrawal from sale 
of the October issue. Its members 
are Ethel Friedman, Tom Hall, 
and John Fockler. Ed.]
Although Scottie staffers could 
cite but few actual instances of 
variance of opinion as to the suit
ability of material, they felt that 
the board and the staff differed 
in their opinions of just what the 
boards function was.
Wiley at publication time stated 
that his intention was to suggest
4Girl Asks Boy9%/
To Guild Dance
Semi-Formal Features 
Brad Hunts Orchestra
Brad Hunt and his 13-piece or 
chestra will provide music for the 
Womens Guild annual all-school 
girl ask boy dance to be held 
in Thistle hall, January 15, from
9 p. m. to 1 a. m. A semi-formal 
affair, it will have a June in 
January theme. Flowers are op
tional.
Since Womens Guild is finan 
cially independent of Student 
Council, the organization relies 
solely upon proceeds from this 
anpual dance and its two tag days 
to maintain a fund to be used for 
womens scholarships.
Tickets will be on sale today 
at Skibo and are available the 
remainder of the week from any 
Guild member. Admission is $2.50 
per couple.
to Council that a provisional 
board be set up to administer and 
Scottie and investigate possibili
ties of reactivating the Scottie as 
soon as possible.
However, Dean Dickinson had 
already opined that should the 
Scottie staff resign, Student Coun
cil would probably not find it 
practical to finance an untried 
staff this year.
As to the possibility of the Pub
lications committee of Student 
Council taking any effective ac
tion in the matter, Wiley said that 
he thought the committee as now 
constituted was worthless so 
far as acting on such problems as 
this is concerned.
A friendly note was proffered 
by the departing Scottie staff, 
who stated that they would be 
glad to aid any group which 
might try to reactivate the mag
azine, and would turn over their 
plans for a new and better Scot 
tie should this be desired.

To Remain Until 
Contract Expires 
At End Of June
After a three-year tenure as 
head coach of the Carnegie Tech 
football and basketball teams, 
Bill Donohoe will resign his po
sition when his present contract 
expires this June. The announce
ment was made by athletic direcfor Buddy Overend, December 26.
Overend received a letter from 
Donohoe dated December 6, in 
which the coach said that he would 
not sign a new contract this June. 
Release of Donohoes resignation 
was being held back until he had 
a chance to make contacts for a 
new position.
When a misleading report ap 
peared in a local paper saying 
that dissension among football and 
basketball players over the coach
ing situation was on the threshold 
of driving Donohoe out, Overend 
released the news of the resigna[Continued on page 4]

Reinstituting the sponsorship of 
an annual Arts ball, the Beaux 
Arts honorary has announced its 
plans for the 1949 dance. This will 
be the first time since 1933 that 
the Arts ball is being held an 
nually instead of every other year.
Scheduled date for the all-arts 
school night is February 11. This 
years theme is, appropriately, 
La Bal International, with both 
costumes and decorations repre
sentative of all countries.
Over the large arch on the main 
floor of the Fine Arts building a 
replica of an American honkytonk will be constructed as the 
central part of the decorations 
At one end of the corridor ad
joining the arch, there will be a 
Chinese den, while at the oppo
site end a Persian cafe will add 
to the international flavor. In the 
large exhibition room a German 
park, complete with bandstand 
will be the center of attention. It 
is here that Benny Benack and

At last weeks Student Coun
cil meeting, election times and 
procedures were decided. After 
the meeting it was definitely 
determined by the Election 
Committee that the action tak
en was illegal and inapplicable. 
For this reason the elections 
chairman, exercising what he 
considers is his prerogative, is 
setting new dates for petition 
returns and the election.
The reasons for disallowing 
Councils actions last week are 
as follows: (1) The motion
authorizing election procedures 
stated that this motion shall 
be construed to overrule any 
by-laws with which it may 
conflict. Director Miner of the 
division of student personnel 
and welfare, who must approve 
any changes in the by-laws, 
was unable to divine the in
tention of the motion and has 
returned it for clarification. The 
motion, for that reason, can
not be considered to have tak
en effect, and (2), Council pro
ceeded under the assumption 
that the newly revised consti
tution was in effect, where in 
fact it had not been approved 
by the Executive board of the 
school, a necessary step in its 
becoming effective. Under the 
old constitution, a week must 
elapse between the time that 
positions are announced as be
ing open and the date that pe
titions are due. Under this pro
vision the election could not 
possibly be given proper pub
licity and still be held this se
mester.

The representatives to be
elected in each of the colleges 
are as follows: Engineering,
seven; Margaret Morrison, 
three; Fine Arts, four. In addi
tion one special representative 
must be elected from the Col
lege of Engineering for a term 
of one semester, to fill a va
cancy left by a resignation.
Also a non-voting assistant 
secretary must be elected from 
Margaret Morrison in addition 
to the three regular positions. 
This position is open only to a 
junior in the secretarial depart
ment and will be filled by an 
all-school vote. The assistant 
secretary becomes a voting 
member during her second se
mester when she becomes sec
retary of Council.
A candidate must be a full 
time day student and at least 
a second semester freshman. 
Petitions are available in the 
office of the Dean of Men. 
Twenty-five signatures of un
dergraduate day students in 
the college of the candidate 
are required. Signatures on a 
petition for assistant secretary 
may be from all colleges.
In the event of duplicate sig
natures on petitions, .the sig
nature on the first petition re
turned to the Dean of Mens 
office will be honored.
The current confusion in 
Council concerning election 
procedures is unfortunate. De
sired ends seem to have been 
obscured by the means. How
ever, after all the parliament
ary and quasi-legal pot-pourri 
has been boiled down: There 
well be an election conducted 
on a basis which is to the best 
interests rT the student body as 
a whole. Nr partisan pressures 
will be allowed as nr when and 
how the elections to Student 
Council well be conducted. The 
Elections committee of Council 
is pledged nr this end.

Confusion never swept over Student Council 
in bigger waves than it did last Wednesday. A 
distinct disservice will be done by Council to the 
student body if it does not quickly take some 
action to prevent such a situation from recur
ring.

As long as anyone concerned with student

to be, experience dictates that the law must be 
known.
E[ Gir!g!
Our first reaction to the series in the Janu
ary 8 and 15 issues of Colliers entitled The 
College Fraternity Crisis was a rather angry 
one. What purported to be an analysis was ac
tually an irresponsible rabble-rousing effort 
which never stooped to the truth when halftruths served its purposes as well.
The tempting bait thrown out to the unin
formed reader was: These things are EVIL. They 
exist. Therefore everyone concerned with these 
EVIL things is a menace to the American way 
of life. This shaky logic was complemented with 
a convincing array of quotes, facts, and figures.

Yet nhg Colliers series should serve as a 
warning to the fraternities of the sort of irre
sponsible criticism that can be and is thrown 
in nhgm. Certainly few of even the most rabid 
fraternity supporters would deny that frater
nities have their weak points and other diffi
culties.

Fraternity men must realize that their or

upon the presumption that they are a construc
tive influence on our college campuses. So long 
as they can show an unblemished record of 
benefit to their members and a real contribu
tion to their educational experiences, fraterni
ties will have no difficulty in justifying their 
existence.

Resignation of the Scottie staff presents Stu
dent Council with another interesting problem. 
While we feel that the demise of the present 
Scottie is probably not an unmitigated tragedy, it 
is regrettable that a situation such as this had to 
arise.

Informality bordering on and often becoming 
inefficiency has hampered the Scottie staff in the 
past and probably greatly complicated such an 
adjustment. But this resignation seems quite 
childish and apparently stems from quite differ
ent reasons than those presented.

Though recruiting a new Scottie staff may be 
difficult, this is preferable to coaxing the old 
one back. The weakness of a situation wherein 
one fraternity, or any other group, continually 
dominates a publication, even when this is le
gally and fairly done, is here amply demonstrat
ed.

The crisis on the Scottie may very well be 
the impetus for a reorganization of the publi
cations system on the Carnegie campus. For the 
Publications committee as it is now constituted is 
a farce. It is constitutionally unworkable. No edi
tor or business manager will crack down on a 
brother editor or business manager to whom he 
might have to appeal the following week.
While all reasonable operating powers must 
be left in the hands of the publications staffs, 
those powers which now rest in the Publications 
committee and Student Council should for nhg 
most part be given to boards empowered to ian

Free Chest X-Rays 
Available To Tech 
Students 9-5 Daily
All students who have chests%are invited to have them X-Ray
ed for free all this week. A mobile 
unit sponsored by a number of 
public health agencies will be 
parked near the flagpole in front 
of Fine arts for the remainder of 
the week.
Since the chest normally con
sists of that portion of the anat
omy between the belt and the 
neck, it is thought that most Car
negie students will be eligible for 
these free examinations.
The examination unit, open 
from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. daily 
through January 15, requires less 
than a minute for an examination. 
Since the weather is rather chilly, 
students will not divest them
selves of more than their outer 
garments for the exams.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1949THE CARNEGIE TARTAR
Adelman9 s Corner of God99 
Is Next Drama Production
CITs drama department will 
present a new play from January 
14-21Corner of God, written 
by Louis Adelman. Direction is 
by Talbot Pearson, while set de
sign is by Jack Drier.
When the curtain rises Friday 
night the audience will see on the 
stage a street corner representing 
Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This is 
the neighborhood made famous 
by Betty Smiths A Tree Grows 
in Brooklyn.
Laws of the jungle apply to 
Williamsburg. Children who live 
to grow to adulthood have learned 
to fight for survival. In Corner 
of God, Adelman portrays a 
group of people who live in this 
most urban but primitive en
vironment.
While living in a basement 
apartment in Williamsburg, 
Thomas Wolfe wrote the material 
from which his editors hewed 
The Web in the Rock and You
Cant Go Home Again. Wolfe, 
too fascinated by the seething 
competition for existence, at
tempted to record the flavor of 
Williamsburg. Yet in Wolfes 
work there is an objectivity 
which robs it, at times, of warmth 
and compassion. It remains to 
be seen whether Adelman, who 
has known this atmosphere inti
mately for many years, has given 
the public a work alive with sym
pathetic understanding bred of 
subjective familiarity.
Corner of God is the fifth full 
length play to be written by 
Adelman, a junior and play writ
ing major in the drama depart
ment. ,His play, The Barrel Or
gan, was presented last year for 
an invited audience. The Bar
rel Organ was presented in the 
round with the audience sitting 
on all four sides of the acting 
area.

In the most relaxed atmosphere

meeting was held in Skibos pri
vate dining room on Thursday 
evening, December 18.

and the value of campus politics 
held the floor for two hours of en
lightening, if not intellectual, dis
cussion.
Dr. Doherty agreed that Satur
day classes were a necessary evil, 
and if they could be eliminated, 
taking into consideration all the 
requirements that must be met, he 
would certainly favor the change. 
I hold no brief for them, he said, 
and suggested that Robert John
son, Tartan editor, who had 
broached the subject, take his re
quest to eliminate them to the Ex
ecutive Board.
[The Executive Board was to 
consider these proposals yester
day. Ed.]
Jim McGiffin, Scotch and Soda 
head, noted that his organization 
was in a state of indecision as to 
just how big their plans for the 
future should be. He said that the 
members realize that the produc
tion has become very close to an 
activity of the drama department, 
but that the members would like 
to try travelling shows like those 
put on by other college groups.
The president felt that it was a 
question of, When does the tail 
begin to wag the dog.
Concerning student plans for 
expediting production of the CBook, Dr. Doherty said that he 
was in favor of any improvement 
that could be made, but that ex
perience had clearly shown that 
the responsibility must continue 
to rest in the Public Relations 
office.
As the tenor of the meeting be
came even more relaxed, Gerry 
Meyers asked the president what 
his opinion was of campus poli
tics. I believe there is value in 
campus politics because the expe
rience is related to the way many 
things are done in real life. There 
are many valuable things thus to 
be learned.

election date. The consensus was 
that the election should be crowd
ed into this semester rather than 
be delayed until next term.
[See the official notice on page 
1 for a summary of events sub
sequent to the Council meeting.]
Complicating the proceedings 
were failure of Council to show 
up with quorums at its two pre
vious meetings and the fact that 
two constitutions and uncounted 
sets of by-laws were alternately 
accepted and rejected as applica
ble.
Surprisingly enough Council 
did manage to stagger through to 
other than the election decisions. 
Several budget approvals, a resig
nation from Council, social and 
Homecoming reports, and an un
successful attempt to change the 
design of the all-school activities 
key were made before and during 
a short intermission of the Siegel 
Lang battle.
Question of a proper date for 
the all-school election started at 
the Council meeting before

Recognizing the fact that better 
rules for fraternity rushing should 
be set up, and anticipating the 
enrollment of a new freshman 
class in February, the Interfra
ternity council this week an
nounced some additions to the 
rushing rules now in force.
Fundamentally, these new rules 
provided for an unbiased frater
nity indoctrinating reception, in 
addition to the Deans reception, 
for all incoming freshmen men.
At this reception either the 
Dean or Assistant Dean of Men 
would address the students in an 
attempt to explain to them just 
what points should be considered 
in selecting a fraternity, what 
fraternity life consists of, and 
what to expect if they do go fra
ternity.
Immediately after this address 
two representatives from each 
fraternity would be available at 
the reception to meet the fresh
men and informally discuss their 
particular fraternity with the 
newcomers.
In order to insure the attend
ance of all incoming men inter
ested in fraternities, the council 
also announced that any man not 
attending the reception, unless he 
presented a valid excuse to the 
council, would be ineligible for 
pledging during the coming se
mester.
Although this plan was sched
uled to go into effect at the be
ginning of the spring term, IF 
council at the present time will 
not be able to use it because of 
the fact that to date only twelve 
students have been accepted for 
the coming session.
no quorum at the meeting, no 
final decision could be reached at 
that time.
I am a little tired, Council 
man Siegel admitted as he started I 
his latest election report. He ex
plained that he had set the date 
for the election in good faith 
and following all rules of Coun
cil with which he was acquainted. 
However, Mr. Lang had insisted 
that the election would have to 
be held next semester since suf
ficient notice could not be given.
At the latest meeting Lang re
versed his previous stand and 
with equal vehemence insisted 
that the election could and must 
be held this semester. Then the 
feathers, constitutions, and by
laws flew.
Councilman Siegel argued his 
point from a set of by-laws that 
he had in his possession while Mr. 
Lang used another set of by-laws 
to back up his arguments. This 
led to the confusion which estab
lished three different dates for 
the election, all of which were 
proved unconstitutional by either 
Mr. Lang or Councilman Siegel.
Arguments subsided after an 
hour and five  minutes when 
Councilman OHare made the 
motion to set the election date for 
January 21 with the provision 
that the motion supercede all by
law rules of the subject. This 
motion was passed.
A still smoldering fire then 
blazed anew when Mr. Siegel 
stated that the number of Coun 
cil members to be elected in the 
engineering school was nine. 
Lang, however, proved that seven 
was the proper number.
Womens guild Student Coun
cil, and Scimitar had their 
budgets approved. Also approved 
was the resignation of George 
Zenk from tru[ael.

4THE tARNEGIE TABTANWEDNECDAY, JANUARY 12, 1949
Plaid Tops Grove City, Loses To Pitt
Piul OTTgrmi[[ss'
Combination of Lack
BreaksDonohoe9s Job
Bill Donohoe has become another unfortunate victim of 
that old adage, If a team is good its the players; if its 
bad its the coach.
This June, Donohoe will bow out of the Carnegie pic
ture, following a three-year stay as head football and basket
ball coach at his alma mater. It seems ironical that Donohoes 
two stays at Carnegie, both for three years, and separated 
by two decades placed him in important roles when Carnegie 
was on top of the football heap and again when they were 
on the bottom of it.
Not everyone knows it, but Donohoe was a very im
portant cog in a great football machine that put the name 
of Carnegie Tech on the map back in the 1920s. In fact he 
was running star of the 1926 Tartans who whitewashed a 
great Notre Dame team, 19-0, and Pitt, 14-0.
On the basketball floor, where he had first won ath
letic laurels in high school, Donohoe was a tower of 
strength on Tartan court teams for two years.
The past three years, on the other hand, have produced 
nothing but gray hairs for him. Several times we asked him 
why he continued on at a school which had so completely 
turned its back on athletics. Each time his answer was, Its 
my'Alma Mater.
In looking over Donohoes last football team, we found 
that he had only eight men with two years of college experience, 
and none with three years. The remainder of the squad con
sisted of fourteen freshmen and fifteen sophomores, six of whom 
had not even had high school experience. Six of the thirdyear men were hampered by severe injuries throughout the 
season, one being knocked out for the entire season before 
the first game, and another one being put out of action for 
the year on the first play of the first game.
The injury list for the rest of the season was even more 
lengthy. Two very good examples were Nick Simcic and Jack 
Magnifico, first-string sophomore backs who never even lugged 
a ball for a high school team. Through a great part of the 
season these two were better examples of Walt Willoughbys 
finesse on quick patchwork jobs.
Donohoes sincereity on and off the football field has 
earned him a host of friends. One very close observer on 
the Carnegie athletic scene, who has been associated with 
coaches most of his life, paid Donohoe a fitting tribute by 
saying, If my son ever plays football, I would want him 
to play for a man like Bill Donohoe. Bill was always the 
gentleman first, and the coach second.
This just about sums up our opinion of Bill Donohoe also. 
His main coaching fault?He is-too good a guy!

tion to the press.
Almost 40 applications for the 
vacant coaching job have been 
received in the Intercollegiate 
athletic office. Overend announc
ed his intention of taking plenty 
of time to consider each and ev
ery application before announcing 
a successor to Donohoe.
Overend also said that the foot
ball and basketball coaching jobs 
would be broken up into two sep
arate posts. For the past three 
years this has been a serious bot
tleneck when it came time for the 
Tartan basketball team to open 
its season, usually less than three 
weeks after the completion of 
football.
Although Overend would not 
commit himself on any of the ap
plicants names, it is known that 
at least one Pittsburgh Steeler, end 
Bob Davis, is in the running for 
the grid post. Assistant basketball 
coach Mel Cratsley is probably the 
leading candidate for the court job.

Cagers Deny Truth 
Of News Reports 
Of Dissention
By Piul OTTgrmi[[
Interviews with several of the 
players during the past week 
completely discredited statements 
made in local papers concerning 
dissension on the football and 
basketball team over Bill Dono
hoes coaching ability.
Dave Ellies, who was men
tioned in one of the articles, ve
hemently denied that he had quit 
the basketball team because of 
his feelings toward Donohoe. 
When Dave quit, two days after 
the first game of the season, he 
emphasized the fact that he was 
quitting only because he felt he 
was no longer of any value to the 
team.
After playing four years of 
high school ball, one year of col
lege ball at Canisius, two years 
on a service team, and last year 
for the Tartans, Dave admitted 
that basketball no longer held the 
appeal to him that it did in high 
school. He was married during 
the summer and found that the 
long practice hours and frequent 
road trips did *not make good 
hours for family life.
Another player mentioned in 
the same article quit last year for 
reasons that are more the result 
of his own personality than the 
ability of any coach.
Of the many players contacted 
on the question of what they 
thought of the coaching, the gen
eral opinion was that Donohoe 
suffered mostly from a lack of 
material with which to work. 
Players repeatedly stated that 
there was never a coach that they 
had tried harder to win for than 
Bill Donohoe. Basketball players 
were especially peeved at the 
newspaper article since it implied 
that there was dissension on the 
team.

Theodore Scores 33 Points, Fails

Still riding the crest of the wave 
which carried them to three vic
tories on their Christmas tour 
through Florida, the University 
of Pittsburgh basketball team 
downed a hard fighting Carnegie 
Tech five, 48-43, at the Skibo 
gymnasium on January 5.
Dr. H. C. Carlsons Panthers 
took command early in the con
test and managed to hold the 
lead despite the consistently 
forcing brand of play of the Tar
tans. Only once early in the first 
quarter was the Plaid able to go 
ahead in the scoring column, 4-3.
In traditional style, both teams 
resorted to body contact when the 
going got tough with the result 
that the game was punctuated at 
frequent intervals by the innum
erable fouls called by the two of
ficials. Four players, two from 
eaqh squad, were chased on fouls 
before the evening was over, 
while several others just manag
ed to stay within the legal limits.
Chief victim of the rough play 
was the Plaids big scoring threat, 
Mike Theodore, who found him
self bottled up by three Panther 
defensemen. Pitt strategy held the 
Tartan ace to three goals from the 
floor but resulted in 15 free 
throws of which 10 were success
ful. Theodores 16 points were 
enough to take individual honors 
despite the efforts of the Blue and 
Golds scoring twins, Sammy Dav
id and Dodo Canterna, 'each of 
whom garnered 14. The trio are 
currently battling for the lead in 
the city college scoring race.
Outstanding effort in foul 
shooting was performed by the 
Scots Jack Riehl, who dropped 
in seven without a miss. In addi
tion Riehl, together with Marty 
Chetlin, gave local fans a fine 
display of both defensive and of
fensive skill throughout the en
tire 40 minutes.
This defeat, thirteenth in suc
cession for the Tartans at the 
hands of their Oakland rivals, was 
the sixth of the season against 
two victories.
In their two game holiday tour, 
Carnegie Techs basketeers broke 
even with a victory over St. Vin
cent, 63-39, at Duquesne Gardens 
on December 27 and a 90-52 de
feat at the hands of powerful 
Bradley Tech in Peoria, Illinois 
on December 30.
Mike Theodore carried off scor
ing honors in the Bradley game 
with 24 markers, while Joe Matsey tallied 20 against St. Vin
cent to lead both teams.
Both games were one-sided af
fairs. The Bearcats were no match 
for the Plaid who piled up a 24- 
6 lead in the first quarter and 
then walked in with a victory 
for Coach Bill Donohoe on the 
day following the official an
nouncement of his resignation.
Ranked fourth in the nation by 
the Associated press writers poll, 
Bradley had little trouble with 
the visiting Pittsburghers. After 
humbling the Tartans, 45-20, 
during the first half, the unbeat
en hosts rested their first string 
for the remainder of the contest 
and coasted to the victory.
Theodore tossing in 13 field goals 
and 7 free throws for a 33 point 
total. The Tartan ace had little 
trouble finding the hoop with his 
one-handed shots which kept the 
Scots in front all the way except 
for one brief moment in the sec
ond period when the score was 
deadlocked at 17-17.
Theodores effort, which fell two 
points short of the all-time Car
negie record of 35 set by the 
present assistant coach Mel Crats
ley, left him in undisputed poscession of the city college scoring 
lead. The towering Plaid center 
rang up 17 of his tallies in the 
first half, but was outscored after 
the intermission by teammate Jack 
Riehl, who garnered all of his 18 
points in the second half.
Bish and Robertson led the 
Grovers attack with 12 points 
each.
The victory was the third in 
succession for the Tartans over 
the Red and White quintet which 
dropped both ends of the homeand-home series last year.
Coach Bill Donohoes fioormen 
will return to their home hard
wood on Wednesday to play host 
to a strong Washington and Jef
ferson squad which tonight 
squeezed by Bethany, 57-56.
Wash-Jeff mentor, Adam Saun
ders, has adapted footballs con
troversial two platoon system to 
the basketball game with success
ful results this year and will prob
ably continue to employ the sys
tem against the Tartans. The Phi 
Kappa and Pi Kappa Alpha fra
ternities will play a preliminary 
to the regular contest at 7 oclock.

Swimmers Surprise With Easy 
Win Over Kent Cning, 50-25
Showing a well balanced squad, Carnegies swimming team 
opened its season last Saturday at home by trouncing Kent State, 
50-25. Plaid men took firsts in 7 of 9 events.
Nick Demas, talented plebe, paced the Tartan team by taking 
firsts in the 100-yard and 220-yard ?
free style events and participating 
on the victorious 400-yard relay
team.
Dependable Dave Luckey paced 
the breast stroke coming home in 
the good time of 2:39.6. This 
marks the continuation of a win
ning streak which extends back 
over two seasons.
Particularly pleasing to Coach 
Sofield were wins in the fre style 
dashes and the 400-yard free style 
relay.
Barrs win in the 150-yard back 
stroke, Zukaskys first in diving, 
and the winning combination of 
Molny, Luckey, and Sapper, in the 
300-yard medley relay rounded 
out the Skibo victories.
The next home meet is schedul
ed for January 22 with tough
Fenn. Prior to that, however, the 
squad will visit Case, Oberlin, and 
Slippery Rock.
The summary of events:
300-yard medley relayWon by Tech (Molny, Luckey, Sapper). Time 3:17.220-yard free styleWon by Demas (Tech); Wilson (Kent), second; Macy (Tech), third.

Emanon forged far out in front 
in the race for the All-Points 
trophy as they captured the 
intramural volleyball and wrestl
ing championships. This double 
victory put Emanon 329 points 
ahead of their nearest competitor, 
TNT, and 512.5 points ahead of 
third place Kappa Sigma, the big
gest lead ever amassed so early 
in the race.
Volleyball season closed with 
PIKA, Emanon and TNT the un
defeated league champions. In 
the playoffs the fine playing of 
PiKA defeated TNT in two 
straight games, while Emanon 
won a close decision over TNT in 
3 hard fought matches. In the 
finals Emanon, displaying good 
teamwork, defeated PiKA in the 
first game by the thin margin of 
22-20 and went on to win the sec
ond game and the school cham
pionship by a score of 21-14.
Emanon was also victorious in 
intramural wrestling as Horsch, 
McBeth, Mavregian and Neilan 
won the 128, 155, and 175 pound 
and heavyweight class champion
ships to give Emanon 289 points 
and the campus wrestling crown. 
Kappa Sigma, with Stevens win
ning in the 145-pound class, was 
runner-up with 149 points, while 
Citcom, with Schmitt victorious 
in the 121-pound class, was third. 
Knapp and Hawkins of BTP were 
the 136 and 165-pound class vic
tors. All-points standings:

Aided by Carnegie students, 
high school boys, and the CIT 
maintenance staff, the Main libra
ry completed its move to new 
quarters in 355-60 Administration 
hall over the Christmas vacation.
This change was made to en
large the library. Both reader and 
stack space have been expanded; 
new furniture and additional steel 
shelving have been added.
A $35,000 grant by the Buhl 
foundation of Pittsburgh com
pleted a CIT library book fund 
drive for $110,000. Melvin J.
Voight, Carnegie librarian, said 
the money is to be used exclu
sively for books, journals, and 
periodicals. This will make many 
publications available at Carne
gie which are not in other Pitts
burgh libraries or many techni
cal college libraries.
According to Mr. Voight, CIT 
will spend approximately $75,000 
for engineering and science pub
lications, $25,000 for published 
material in the fields of fine arts, 
and the remaining $10,000 for 
books for Margaret Morrison col
lege.
Beaux Arts Ball
[Continued from page 2]
his band will play for dancing.
In addition to the cafes and var
ious booths, two large mobile 
units, composed of the flags of 
different countries in abstract 
shapes, will be prominently dis
played. Three large paintings of 
African, Venetian, and European 
peasant themes will be placed in 
the lower foyer.
In addition to the dancing in 
the large exhibition room,' enter
tainment derived from the coun
try it represents will be featured 
by each booth. Costumes at the 
ball, as in past years, do much to 
create the appropriate atmos
phere. Because this years ball is 
international in scope, any cos
tume portraying a character type 
from any land will be appropri
ate. Emphasis on originality is of 
prime importance.
Tickets are $2.20 per person 
and will be on sale the last week 
in January. Although the ball is 
traditionally a stag affair for all 
Art school students, dates will not 
be prohibited. Tickets may be 
purchased from any member of 
the Beaux Arts honorary.
Liaison Committee 
Continues Faculty 
Evaluation Project
Engineering students will again 
this semester have an opportunity 
to rate their instructors at the 
close of the term. The instructor 
evaluation project, begun last 
spring by the Student Faculty 
Liaison committee, is having 8,000 
rating sheets printed for use this 
semester.
Termed a success last year, the 
major shortcomings was that not 
enough of the rating sheets were 
printed, and many instructors 
didnt have an opportunity to use 
them.
Although use of the rating 
sheets is optional with each in
structor, virtually all who had the 
opportunity used them last year. 
The results of the ratings are 
known only to the instructor con
cerned, and they are not used by 
the school as the basis of any ac
tion.

Editorial
A[rnhgr I[veniner[
At the beginning of each year the Plaid editor composes 
his finest editorial of the year. Conforming to a long estab
lished precedent it is an appeal to the evening students to 
join wholeheartedly in the activities sponsored by Evening Stu
dent Council and the other active groups on campus. It is a 
labor of love, and as is generally the case with such labors it 
falls upon unheeding minds. The students in general in the 
past five or six years have failed to respond to these appeals.
It is therefore with a deep bow of appreciation that we 
give credit .to those organized groups on the evening campus, 
the three fraternities and the newly organized sorority, for 
valiantly carrying on their own full social programs and for 
greatly sustaining the all school activities. The fraternities, Sig
ma Delta Phi, Phi Nu, Nu Sigma, Sigma Alpha and the sorority, 
Phi Gamma Pi have gained the leadership in the social pro
gram of :the evening school.
These organizations have successfully bridged the gap 
caused by- the lean war years, and are giving the evening 
campus an air of bustling activity. Their recently held inter
fraternity dinner dance was a fine example of the activity 
which can be expected in the future.
It is to be regretted that the fraternities are the only 
groups on campus which can be depended upon to produce 
a social calendar. The independent students on campus far 
outnumber the organized ones here, but it is found that the 
fraternity people are more in evidence at all the open affairs. 
We are glad that :the extra-curricular work has returned al
most to the prominence that it held formerly, but we would 
like to see more students taking part.

Now that the last Merry Yuletide and Happy New Year, greet
ings have faded to mere memories 
we can get down to business and 
prepare for final examinations that 
will soon be deviling us with their 
mercilessness.
The second annual Christmas 
assembly presented by Evening 
Student Council is also now only 
a memory, but Council wants to 
thank all the students, instructors, 
the administration, and the guests 
who helped to make the assembly 
a success.
As time nibbles into the early 
days of 1949 some of us attempt 
to bolster our ego with resolutions, 
hoping against hope to prove that 
we will have the strength to keep 
them; although very few of us 
actually do keep them. But we 
know of an evening student who 
has a fairly decent chance of 
keeping his, for this is his reso
lution. He resolves that there 
will be a change in his smoking 
habits. He is going to quit limit
ing himself to a pack of cigarettes 
before breakfast, a pack before 
lunch, and a pack before dinner, 
and one more before he hits the 
sack. He finally resolves to smoke 
all he wants from now on. Isnt 
that a sensible resolution to make,
Speaking of resolutions wouldnt 
it be nice if perhaps a couple 
hundred evening students would 
resolve to attend Councils next 
dance. Incidentally the dance 
which has been scheduled for 
February 5 has been postponed a 
few weeks. Watch this page for 
the date of the next dance.
At long last the Evening Stu 
dent Achievement Plaque is hang
ing in its honored place on the 
wall at the foot of the circular 
stairway in Administration Hall 
Stop by any evening and see it 
yourself. It is really a beautiful 
addition to the numerous plaques 
in that area.
This bit of our column is di 
rected to those evening students 
who have been wondering what 
that large metal cabinet placed 
on the third floor of Engineering 
Hall is used for, well fellows the 
mystery is out. Some of the more 
inquisitive evening students fin
ally unclothed this metal mystery 
and took a look into its interior

tem which has been made obsolete 
by the changes in the number of 
activities through which the stu
dents can earn an award. The 
new set-up now in effect lowers 
the number of points necessary to 
earn the award and gives a more 
equitable basis for determinate ri 
of awardees. Under this system it 
is believed that more of the e -

Council also received Anthony

Fgnr Transferring
Veterans who plan to transfer 
to some other university or onthe-job training program at the 
end of this semester should apply 
at once for a supplemental cer
tificate of eligibility, in order that 
it be processed prior to February
1, 1949. Application MUST BE 
MADE THROUGH THE VETER
ANS OFFICE, 133 Industries hall.
Veterans are reminded that the 
effective date of a supplemental 
certificate is the date the appli
cation is received by the Veterans 
administration, 107 Sixth Street, 
and NOT the date the applica
tion is signed by the veteran.
Since considerable time is re
quired by the Veterans adminis
tration in processing a supplemen
tal certificate following receipt of 
application, it is recommended 
that veterans transferring from
CIT at mid-year lose no time in 
instituting transfer procedures.
Kiltie Concert
CITs Kiltie Symphonic band 
will present a concert at the Car
negie Music hall on January 14 
at 8:15 p. m. Tickets can be pur
chased at the Carnegie Tech 
music office or at the door for 75 
cents.
One of the highlighted features 
on the program will be a trumpet 
trio playing The Three Trump
eters by G. Agostini. The solo
ists are Ben Benack, William My
ers, and William Boehmer.
A total of ninety musicians will 
be on stage Friday night, making 
the band larger than it has ever 
been in its 26-year history. Bag
pipers will be dressed in full uni
form, while other members will 
wear their kiltie skirts and tux
edo jackets.
