time each week.
Featured will be such programs

Peace on Earth??
The Union is festive and gay with its tinseled tree and ever
greens; the glee clubs going acarolling; students are harmon
izing on Jingle Bells and Silent Night; mysterious pack
ages are piling up in cupboards.
Yes, the hands of the seasonal clock are once more point
ing to Christmas.
There will be trees and candles and Yule logs and holly; 
there will be family gatherings and turkey dinners and hand
kerchiefs from great-aunt Agatha.
As a part of these traditional festivities a familiar quota
tion will be unpacked from the mothballs to decorate the holi
days. It will be worn out by repetition in carols, seasons greet
ings, Christmas messages, and radio commercials; Peace on 
earth, good will to men is destined to the humble role of a 
meaningless collection of hackneyed words.
Yet in Christmas 1946 these words seem more pertinent than 
2000 years ago.
Superficially, this is a peacetime Christmas. The war is 
j for the first time in many years reunited families can 
the happy holiday together.
is there peace, good will to menf
Because of misunderstandings and suspicions, the communist 
nations are lining up to defend themselves against the capitalist 
nations and the capitalist nations are in turn lining up to de
fend themselves against the communist nations. Within coun
tries, these same factions are festering sorepoints of unrest and 
hostility.
In Germany the misbehavior of American troops and the 
discord between the allied nations is a potent fertilizer for the 
germination of ever-latent seeds of war.
For the displaced Jews in Europe, there is no peace, no 
good will. Around the world, lands are torn by civil war.
At home there is a disastrous, stubborn management-laborpeople strugglenot to mention the outbreaks of local violence 
against minority groups.
During the war, as inspiration for the doughboy, propa
ganda extolled a lasting peace, a united world, the brotherhood 
of man; but now the war is won, propaganda is promoting na
tionalism, self-security, power alliances, and a doctrine of mili
tary, economic, and social superiority.
The grim fear of a third world war has rooted itself in the 
conscious or subconscious of almost every mind, and with it 
lurks the brothers of fear, of total self-destruction. In hushed 
tones reserved for death or insanity,' fpeople whisper 
about the coming war with Russia, Germany, England, or the 
Orient.
War or peace is a vital question today-not only for states
men, politicians, industrial magnates, and scholars, in whose 
hands war has been a perennial recurrence since the beginning 
of history. War or peace is a question for the citizens of the 
world. It is known that people untainted by nationalistic pro
paganda have seldom wanted war. tfhey do not want it now.
Yet it is these people who will fight the next war; it is 
these people who will die. Then it must be these people who 
can prevent that war.
College students throughout the world, as representatives 
and leaders of their peoples, have the greatest responsibility 
in deciding this question of war or peace. Students today have in
herited the toughest task in history, the task of ultimate selfpreservation.
It is Christmas again. As the seasonal spirit takes hold, 
laughing lips will glibly echo the most critical challenges of 
all time, in the age-old words: Peace on earth, good will to 
men.

The College Widow
 . . . and a wonderful time 
was had by all, as George Ades 
The College Widow opened at the 
Little Theatre last Wednesday 
night. This, the third of the 
years presentations by the drama 
department, is not a play with a 
message, historical significance, or 
any deeper meaning, but just a 
comedy which imparted to its 
audience the happiest mood which 
the Little Theatre has witnessed 
in many years.
The College Widow was written 
more than forty years ago and, if 
it had been presented straight, 
much of its topical humor might 
have lost its point. But by styliz
ing the play, showing both in the 
acting and the scenery the in
genuousness characteristic of the

A real scoop! The Kappa Sigs 
have been heard from at long last. 
As of Sundays formal initiation, 
they have opened their arms to 
Ed Hicks, Cliff Amend, Bob McKnight, Jim McFarland, Stan 
Smith, and Bob Duncan. Con
grats, fellows!
It is of note that the District 
Kappa Sig Man of the Year award 
went to Bill Beamer, the presen
tation being made at a formal 
dinner at the University Club, 
December 10.
Beta Sig pledges entertained 
the actives and their dates with a 
Circus Carnival for their recent 
pledge dance. M. C.s Heller and 
Kolatch, assisted by a beautiful 
(?) bevy of Balinesian Ballet 
Dancers, provided the sideshow 
entertainment, while Don Schimmel, Kenny Goldbitz, and Larry 
Levine presided over the midway 
and food.
PiKA pledge Sam Highberger

blending into this production a 
great deal of dancing and singing, 
director Lawrence Carra present
ed two hours of continuous fun. 
The audience showed its appre
ciation by almost incessant laugh
ter and applause.
As the town tart and daughter 
of the owner of the local boarding 
house, Lucy Seibert gave a su
perlative performance. From her 
first entrance, her mere presence 
produced gales of laughter, and 
each of her lines added to it. 
Equally outstanding was Tom 
OMalley in a part which, if 
George Ade had known him, 
would have been much bigger. 
Playing the Honorable Elam 
Hicks, he brought down the house 
with his phenomenal soft shoe 
dance in the last act and was 
forced to give encores on both 
opening nights.
It is remarkable that Ade wrote 
the play without having known

Billy, football hero and romantic 
sensation, seems to have been 
written for him. Co-starred with

job.
David Crantz played Billys 
father, a dapper old rogue who 
knows a great deal more about 
the pleasures of college life than 
his son, and his excellent tech
nique brought out the humor of 
every line. Instead of enacting

Members of Physics Faculty 
Head Cyclotron Construction
The members of the staff of the 
Department of Physics who will 
be responsible for the design and 
construction of the syr chrocyclotron, in addition to Dr. Seitz, are 
Professors E. C. Creutz, R. B. 
Sutton, J. G. Fox, and H. C. Corben. Dr. R. F. Mehl, head of the 
department of Metallurgical En
gineering, Dr. J. C. Warner, head 
of the department of Chemistry 
and dean of graduate studies, and 
Dr. C. C. Monrad, head of the 
Chemical Engineering department, 
will be closely associated with the 
work. Also assisting in the proj
ect will be Dr. David S. McKin
ney and Dr. Claude R. Schwob.
Dr. Creutz, one or the first ex
perimental physicists to study 
nuclear chain reactions, was as
sociated with the atom bomb ex
periments at Los Alamos in 1944. 
After completing his graduate 
work in nuclear physics at the 
University of Wisconsin, Dr. 
Creutz joined the staff of Prince
ton University where he began 
experiments in his field. Later he 
went to the metallurgical labora
tory at the University of Chicago 
when the Princeton and Columbia 
University projects were moved 
there.
Dr. Sutton was also associated 
with the laboratory at Los Alamos 
from the time of its inception and 
has a wide experience in funda 
mental nucleonics. He received 
his doctors degree in work on 
nuclear chain reactions at Prince
ton.
Dr. Fox, in commoa with sev
eral of his associates, went to the 
Los Alamos laboratory in 1944 
after completing his doctorate at 
Princeton in nuclear fission. Pro
fessor Fox was for a time asso
ciated with the Hercules Powder 
Company.
Dr. Corben is a theoretical phy
sicist who has specialized in the 
problems of nuclear physics. A 
native of Australia, Professor Cor
ben was Senior Lecturer at the 
University of Melbourne, where 
he was also Dean of Trinity Col
lege and an advisor to the Royal 
Army Inventions Directorate. He 
Joined th staff oi Carnegie Tech
in September.
Dr. Mehl, one of the most dis
tinguished men in metallurgy, has 
been the recipient of many awards 
and is the author of numerous pa
pers and publications in his field. 
Before coming to CIT he had been 
associated with Princeton and 
Harvard Universities; with the 
Naval Research Laboratory in 
Washington, and with American 
Rolling Mill company. Part of his 
research included work on inter
atomic forces in metals and alloys.
One of the leading men in the 
atomic bomb experiments, Dr. 
Warner was on leave to the proj
ect from 1943 until his recent re
turn to Carnegie Tech. While on 
leave, he worked directly under 
Dr. Charles A. Thomas, vicepresident of the Monsanto Chem
ical company, and was given di
rection of the plutonium purifica
tion problem. In this work he di
rected and coordinated research 
in the laboratories of the Univer
sity of Califronia, University of 
Chicago, Iowa State College, 
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and at Los Alamos. He 
later carried on vital work on the 
bomb at Oak Ridge. In 1945 he 
was the recipient of the Pitts
burgh Award of the American 
Chemical Society for outstanding 
service to chemistry.
Recently appointed head of the 
department of Chemical Engineer
ing, Dr. Carl C. Monrad was the 
first of Carnegie Tech faculty 
members to be called up in con
nection with national defense. He 
held important posts in Washing
ton throughout the war in the 
governments synthetic rubber 
and chemical engineering pro
grams.
Dr. McKinney, a Carnegie grad
uate, was section chief of the 
chemistry division in the metal
lurgical laboratory at Chicago 
during the bomb development.
A graduate of Fordham, where 
he received his doctors degree in 
chemistry, Professor Schwob was 
a member of the Manhattan Dis
trict project from April 1944 
through 1945 at Chicago and Los 
Alamo.
A.S.M.E.
The American Society of Me
chanical Engineers, meeting on 
Wednesday, December 4, was en
tertained with the technicolor 
movie Unfinished Rainbows, a 
feature length picture on the his
tory and development of alumi
num. It graphically described the 
industrial processes which are 
employed in the production of 
this most useful metal and ended 
with a colorful chronology of the 
uses of aluminum.
In the business meeting which 
followed, the A.S.M.E. banquet 
plans were discussed. A motion 
for bi-monthly meetings on 
Thursdays at 7:00 p. m. was made 
and carried. Guest speakers or 
movies will be scheduled for these 
meetings.
Cyclotron
[Continued from page I] 
ucation in nuclear technology. To 
the latter end the engineering and 
science program is being adjusted 
to include necleonics studies hav
ing technological applications.
With this phase of the educa
tional program in mind, Dr. Fred
erick Seitz, head of the depart
ment of Physics, has been made 
available to the Clinton Labora
tories at Oak Ridge this winter on 
part-time leave to direct the 
training program there. During 
the war Professor Seitz was sec
tion chief in the theoretical divi
sion of the metallurgical project 
at the University of Chicago, 
where he became engaged in 
nuclear research.
A number of outstanding 
nuclear physicists have been add
ed to the staff of the Physics De
partment and a project on the 
study of cyclotron magnet designs 
is now in progress.
Purely a research tool, Carne
gies proposed synchro-cyclotron 
would be used to study nuclear 
transformations induced by bom
bardment of nuclei with protons 
and other ions having energies 
near 200 million electrons volts 
(200 Mev). Comparatively little 
work has been done at this en
ergy level since suitable accelera
tors are only now in the process 
of development.
One opportunity of fundamental 
importance afforded by such a cy
clotron is the production of mesons 
(the units of energy formed by 
1000 Mev cosmic rays.) Latest ex
periments indicate that energies 
of from 100 to 200 Mev are re
quired to produce mesons. In view 
of this, Carnegie Tech officials had 
hoped to build a cyclotron with a 
250 Mev potential, instead of 200 
Mev, and may yet do so if addi
tional funds beyond the $550,000 
should become available. Such a 
machine would be more nearly 
comparable with the one at Ber
keley and would occupy a posi
tion of frontier interest for a 
much longer period.
Dr. Doherty estimated that it 
would take two years after re
ceiving sufficient funds for the 
project to construct the cyclotron 
and laboratory.
WCIT Sets
[Continued from page 1] 
is being conducted in the dormi
tories and barracks, will clarify 
the listening tastes of the stu
dents, the hours during which the 
radio is most used, and the ap
proximate number of students in 
the listening audience. At pres
ent, WCITs programs are heard 
only in the barracks and dorms, 
but in a few weeks they will be 
made available to the fraternity 
houses by means of direct tele
phone lines.
Students are vitally needed for 
all activities on the station. There 
will be a general meeting of all 
those interested on Thursday, De
cember 19, at 4:30 p. m. in Fine 
Arts room 107. Any suggestions, 
comments, or criticisms concern
ing the station should be ad
dressed to Box 411, inter-school 
mail.
Notice
All Tartan reporters are 
requested to be sure to check 
the assignment sheets every 
week to find out if they have 
stories. Such assignments are 
to be turned in, typed, no lat
er than 7:30 p. m. Friday. If 
the story occurs after that 
time, the deadline is 3:30 
p. m. Sunday.
The assignments are posted 
on Wednesday morning at the 
following locations: the bulle
tin board in the basement of 
Industries hall, the one in 
Fine Arts building, and the 
board on the stairs of MMCC.
CIT Glee Club
[Continued from page 1] 
will be provided for an informal 
studio audience to view the broad
cast. The program will be the first 
appearance of the Glee Club on 
the campus this year.
The club has already sung at 
the Aspinwall Veterans Hospital 
and the Presbyterian Nurses 
Home, where they were guests at 
a dance following their program.
More than fifty men have join
ed this years Glee Club, making 
it the largest in several years. Mr. 
Braughtigam, director of music at 
Schenley High School, is direc
tor of the club.
Officers are Ed Colaianni, man
ager; Dick Teller, assistant man
ager; Rod Hornbake, librarian.
The regular soloist is Charles 
Tritle, and Howard Palmer is the 
accompanist.
Sims Plays 
At IH Formal
One of the most successful 
semi-formal dances to be held at 
Carnegie Tech this year was Win
ter Carnival, sponsored by Interhonorary Council Saturday night 
in the well-decorated gymnasium. 
White streamers encircled the 
dancing space and made a false 
ceiling. Colored spotlights halp>id 
to create the desired wintry at
mosphere.
Approximately five hundred 
couples were in attendance, pack
ing the exceptionally slippery 
dance floor and the Black Cat.
During the half-hour intermis
sion the Phi Kappa Joe Pash Me
morial Trophy "'was presented by 
Jack South, president of the Phi 
Kappa fraternity, to Ben Baklarz, who was voted the most 
valuable member of the 1946 foot
ball squad by his teammates and 
the coaches.
Joey Sims lived up to his wellestablished reputation by furnish
ing smooth, danceable pieces, in
terspersed with tangos and rum
bas, throughout the evening. Vo
calist Dorothy Morbitt did a won
derful job.
Especially to be commended are 
Jean Streicher, dance chairman, 
and B. L. Schwartz, president of 
IH council, for planning and or
ganizing the first all-school semiformal dance of the year. The 
new system for checking coats in 
Thistle hall was a great improve
ment.

Intramural
Roundup
Just to show you what happens 
when you turn you back for a 
moment, the ATOs, T. X.s, and 
Kilroy A. C. won their clinching 
games this past week to take 
championship honor in the intra
mural volleyball without waiting 
for the results of the closing 
games.
The playoff for the campus 
crown will start tonight at 7:30 in 
the gym when the T. X.s and the 
ATOs try to outtip each other. 
On Wednesday T. X. will meet 
Kilroy, and on Thursday night 
ATO and Kilroy play the final 
game. If the issue is still in doubt 
they will repeat the cycle.
Mondays and Tuesdays games 
in the Scot and Kiltie leagues 
showed who would pick up the 
scraps left by the TXs and Kil
roy.
ORCHIDS AND ANDYLINES
By Andy Cantini
ATTENTION TECH STUDENTS: Your support of our intercolle
giate athletics isto put it mildlyrotten. Your conduct at the bas
ketball game last week was one of the sorriest exhibitions of school 
spirit that I have ever seen. During the early part of the game, jubi
lation was high as our team took the lead, but when the tide began 
to turn and the visitors overwhelmed all efforts that our team could 
muster, there wasnt a peep to be heard. It was only after an irate 
dressing-down by Dick Storm that a few cheers were heard. Thats 
pretty sad when someone in the stands has to get up and tell you 
to give a little applause to your own team. The players on that floor 
are your representatives. Each and every one of you is a member of 
that teambut not a silent 
member. If you have ever watch
ed an intramural game, you know 
what I mean. The team spirit in 
those games is so closely knit that 
it is hard to distinguish between 
the active players and the loyal 
spectators. Why cant we have 
some of that spirit in our intercol
legiate games?
In any game, the difference be
tween a good player and a star 
is the support that the spectators 
give him. The team possesses a 
very generous share of good play
ers, but its up to you to make 
them stars. Lets get out of this 
factory-like manner of attending 
school and give our teams a lit
tle support. A few cheers, a lit
tle applause, and an occasional 
pat on the back will achieve sur
prising results.
Remember this: if this season 
follows the pattern of our foot
ball entry, dont blame the admin
istration, the coaches, or the team; 
but blame yourselves. Potentially, 
this year we are fielding one of 
our best floor teams in many a 
year, and with a little support 
from you, this potentiality can 
become a reality. t
Player-of-the-Week
My player of the week nomina
tion goes to Ben Baklarz, cap
tain of the football team and 
worthy recipient of the first Pash 
Memorial Trophy award. Ben is 
not only a great athlete, but a 
swell guy to boot. Not too much 
praise can be heaped on his 
strong shoulders. Ben is a sen
ior and his presence on the grid
iron as well as on the campus will 
be sorely missed. So to a swells 
guy who is destined to go far in 
any undertaking, I present my 
biggest and best bouquet of 
orchids.
Personal observations: If .there 
are any lovers of the grand game 
of volleyball among you, take in 
one of the Kilroy A. C. games 
and watch a master at work
Ralph Sill. Ralph is one of the 
best performers of the game ever 
seen on this campus and the main 
reason for Kilroys 6-0 record 
... I wish that Mr. Overend 
would either do something about 
the ventilation in the gym during 
our home basketball games or pass 
out gas masks to the spectators.
The foul air brought back fond 
memories of the troopship holds.
I kept writing my last will and 
testament thinking that each suc
ceeding breath was going to be 
my last. There are two sides to 
every question and two sides to 
the gymwith windows. If a 
few of those windows had been 
opened, all my heirs would have 
been relieved of their greedy 
anxiety . . . Too bad that sta
tion WCIT has to restrict its lis
tening audience to dormitories 
only. There are many fine pro
grams aired during the week. One 
Kvhich I recommend is Les Stan
fords Sports Review, broad
cast every Monday at 7:15. This , 
program should be a must on 
everybodys weekly listening 
list . . .

Splits Make Comeback
In the biggest upset of. the 
week at the University Alleys the 
Splits, lead by Bill Swaney with 
a record high of 231, took the Phi 
Kaps for three games. This en
abled the Beta Sigs to take the 
lead in the Turkey league by win
ning two out of three from the 
PiKAs.
Other upsets have the Delt-1 
losing to the Betas 2 to 1, while 
the T. X.s did the same to the 
Delt-2.
In the games that ran as ex
pected the D. U.s, SAEs, and Sig
ma Nus won easily over Com
bine-2, and Combine-3 by scores 
of 3 to 0. The remaining game 
played Saturday was a closely 
contested match between the Tau 
Delts and Kilroy A. C. with Kil
roy coming back in the last two 
games to win 2 to 1.
As the teams now stand the 
league leaders are Dorm Combine 
with a record of 6 and 0, Beta Sig 
5-1, and the Betas 5-1.
Five Men Break 200
Last week was the first time 
that as many as five men broke 
200. Bill Swaney, Ed Bonnett, Joe 
Dickson, Augie Binder, and Joe 
Stekel all made the grade for the 
first time last week. High three 
game score was made by Ed Bon
nett with a 222, 166, 129, for a 
total of 517. Highest team total 
score was turned in by the Splits 
with 2430 pins. The Betas knock
ed down 889 pins for the best 
team game of the season.
Table Tennis Coining to a Close
The three league table tennis 
competition has only two more 
weeks of play left, and as things 
now stand it looks like the unde
feated SAEs, Tau Delts and 
FPHA are in. FPHAs only game 
is against the weaker dorm com
bine. The T. X.s and the Sigma 
Nus, despite the fact that they 
are trailing the leaders by one 
game, should not be counted out 
of the running as "one loss can 
throw the title into a tie.

Tech Five Drops Opener To 
Classy Mountaineer Quintet
The lanky mountaineers of the University of West Virginia mar
red Wild Bill Donohoes floor debut as they scored freely to 
swamp an inexperienced Skibo quintet 76 to 37 before a full house in 
the home gym last Wednesday night.
Tommy Culbertson was the Tartan sensation in the opening sec
onds of the game when he dropped three shots in a row through 
the hoop from outside the foul line before the visitors could catch 
their breath. Culbertson went on to rack up four more field goals and 
a free throw for 15 points, the high for the local quintet.
West Virginia did catch its 
breath. They called time out, re
organized their attack, and pro
ceeded to pile up an impressive 
76 points. Bill Zirkel, the moun
taineer from Brooklyn, led the 
attack with 10 field goals and a 
quartet of free throws. Leland 
Byrd and Fred Shaus were the 
other big guns for the visitors 
with 11 and 16 points respective
ly.
West Virginia Defense Tight
Tommy Culbertsons initial six 
points marked the end of the Tar
tan rampagte. The best the home 
team could do was a single field 
goal in the remainder of the first 
period and a pair of charities in 
the second stanza. So tight was 
the mountaineer defense that the 
Skibo five were only able to at
tempt two shots from under the 
basket in the entire first half.
There were no restrictions on 
the movements of the towering 
West Virginians. They moved fast, 
shot from anywhere and any an
gle. Taking advantage of their 
added height, they repeatedly 
parked under the hoop, sometimes 
getting a half dozen tries before 
the ball slipped through the cords.
Katselas Gives Good Show
Tasso Katselas had a busy night 
even though the opposition limit
ed him to a pair of baskets. He 
sparked the Tartan team in their 
belated second half comeback by 
his spirited and amusing play. He 
shot freely from anywhere and 
went out of his way to make the 
lanky visitors foul him. The sta
tistics showed Tas with four 
successful free throws out of sev
en chances.
With a 50 to 20 lead at the be
ginning of the last period, Coach 
Lee Patton of West Virginia sub
stituted freely and finally cleared 
the bench when his second and 
third stringers went on a scoring

Face Geneva Tomorrow Night 
Tomorrow night the team 
travels to Beaver Falls to face 
Geneva in their first away game. 
The Covies have already played a 
trio of games. Saturday night 
they sustained their first loss at 
the hands of the local Dukes. Pre
viously they had nosed out 
Youngstown by two points and 
had outlasted Bethany in an over
time period.
Friday night Coach Donohoe 
takes his team to face Waynesburg on the latters home floor.
Local fans were greatly amus
ed by Pitts Doc Carlson who sat 
in the stands and planned strat
egy for coming games with both 
Carnegie and West Virginia. The 
Oakland mentor was heard quite 
frequently giving out with oaths 
directed at the officials.
The Pitt boys in three games 
this year have done no better than 
the Skibos. They have dropped 
all and in doing so averaged 34 
points a game. This is three 
less than the Carnegie squad has 
averaged in its single game.
Grid Captain Wins 
Joe Pash Trophy
The first annual award of the 
Joe Pash Memorial Trophy was 
made last Saturday night during 
the intermission of the Vinter 
Carnival Dance. The player vot
ed as the most valuable member 
of the 1946 football squad by his 
fellow teammates and his coaches 
is Baklarz. The presentation of 
the trophy was made by H. Ja^k 
South, president of the local 
chapter of Phi Kappa fraternity, 
the organization sponsoring the 
award.
Jack South Gives Award
In his presentation speech, Jack 
South explained that the presen
tation was the first of a series of 
annual awards to be made to the 
most valuable player of each suc
ceeding years squad. The Trophy 
was named after a Phi Kap of 
several years back, Joe Pash, who 
made a name for himself as a 
player who would never give up. 
Joe gave his life when the sub
marine aboard which he served 
was lose somewhere in the Pacif
ic. In his honor the trophy will be 
presented as a lasting memorial.
Every man on the squad de
served a trophy, but since this 
was impossible, the decision was 
left to the players and the coach
es to select the player most val
uable to the squad. It is felt that 
since all the players receive for 
their efforts is the plaudits of the 
crowds a few hours every Sat
urday afternoon, Phi Kappa fra
ternity is attempting to add some
thing a little tangible to their re
wards. In such a way, the spirit 
that is needed to maintain ath
letes in their proper position will 
be maintained. With these words 
Jack South made the presentation. 
Baklarz Team Captain
Ben Baklarz received the trophy 
after being voted the most valua
ble player of the squad. Ben led 
the team this season at the right 
guard position. During his pre
college days he played for Braddock High School. At Carnegie 
he stood out on the line in the 1942 
and 1943 seasons. He then enter
ed the Navy and played for the 
Oceana, Va., Airstrip Naval team. 
Immediately after his discharge, 
he re-entered Tech in time to add 
his experience to the Inexperienc
ed Tartan eleven. Ben is twentythree years old, weighs 170 lb., is 
a senjor mechanical engineering 
student, and hails from Braddock, 
Pa.
J. V. Squad Tops 
St. Casimir 41-33
The Carnegie Jayvees outplayed 
St. Casimir High 41 to 33. The 
sub-varsity outfit had little trou
ble winning their first game of the 
season and helping to offset the 
West Virginia defeat which the 
varsity suffered directly after
wards.
St. Casmir went ahead near the 
beginning of the game, but the 
Tartan Jayvees soon tied it up, 
took the lead, and held it through 
out the remainder of the contest. 
At times the game resembled a 
free-for-all with but little basket
ball playing in evidence.
Brazen and Ratay, of the visit
ors, paced the scoring with 14 
and 13 points apiece. The Tar
tans were led by Boyc and Cable 
with 11 and 10 points to their 
credit. The stellar defensive play 
of Matsey aided the Jayvees in 
checking the St. Casimir offense.

APO does not assume responsi
bility for each individual on the 
trips, as it is only providing a 
means for group action.
In order to determine student 
interest in the plan, the Tartan 
is cooperating with APO by pro
viding a coupon on page 6 which 
should be placed in the ballot box 
in Skibo before Friday, December 
21, by all students planning to 
attend either game. Turning in 
a coupon does not obligate the 
signer in any way.
For Christmas
Plans are now being made for 
a Christmas dinner and party for 
Tech students who will be unable 
to be at home on Christmas Day. 
Dr. Dickinson, who is in charge 
of arrangements, requests that all 
such students call at his office in 
room 152, Industries hall, as soon 
as possible so that he will know 
the number of guests to expect.
The custom of entertaining stu
dents whose homes are too remote 
from the campus to permit them 
to go home for the holidays began 
in the early days of Carnegie Tech. 
The late Professor Alexander Jay 
Wurts invited groups of these stu
dents to his home for Christmas 
dinner. Later when i*rof. Wurts 
retired from the faculty he es
tablished a fund to continue this 
tradition.
associated with the Mellon Insti
tute of Industrial Research since 
1909, when he was appointed as 
an industrial fellow. His first 
work was in connection with 
camphor research and then, from 
1910 to 1912, ductile gland re
search. From 1912 to 1916 he was 
a senior fellow of the Institute in 
charge of investigations of the 
metallurgy and hydrometallurgy 
of copper. In 1916 he was ap
pointed assistant director of the 
Institute and then followed a suc
cession of administrative offices 
until he became the director in 
1921, which position ife still holds.
Dr. Weidlein is a director of

burgh, trustee of Shadyside Acad

located at Seton Hill. Pennsylva

Carnegie Tech and the University 
of Pittsburgh on Saturday, Decem

In the afternoon there was an 
informal talk to enable the girls 
to become acquainted with each 
other, while at the same time the 
newly organized Seton Hill chap
ter was able to find out what the 
others* had been doing at their 
respective schools.
Two representatives from each 
college were selected to write 
out resolutions concerning orga
nization and ritual for the three 
chapters. Following this was an 
organized discussion on the place 
of the Cwen after graduation.
A reading was given by one of 
the Seton Hill teachers, after 
which the visiting Cwens were en
tertained at dinner and a party 
held later that evening. In the near 
future the Cwens of the other col
leges plan to entertain each oth

Too many people nowadays 
scoff at the Christmas season, pro
ducing from some dusty corner of 
their memory the old story that 
Christmas is for children anyhow. 
How like old Scroogehow very 
typically modern and blase, and 
how very dull!
If one but takes the trouble to 
seek it, there is a lot of satisfac
tion to be derived from this holi
day time. There might not have 
been the family tradition of 
Christmas at Grandmas, or at 
home, in your memory, but there 
surely have been the countless 
associations which constitute 
Christmas.

scurry through the crowds to do

to note the tinkling of the bell of 
the little Salvation Army lass 
standing beside her collection 
chimney. You cant miss the gro
cery stores with their tangerines 
and boxes of mince meat, packag
ed fruit cakes combined with 
Christmas trees stacked against 
frosted windows. Everywhere you 
can see a cherubic face, anticipa
tion written from tip to toe, eager 
noses' pressed against the toy
shop windows, eager eyes watch
ing the new Lionel trains rolling 
through their miniature scenery. 
There are carolers and glittering 
windows, bulky packages, mys
terious whispers, and smiles and 
the ever present Christmasy spir
it of peace-on-earth, good-will to
ward men.
Perhaps if this spirit of good
will were more prevailing 
throughout this speeded genera
tion to which you and I belong, 
the long-forgotten ideals of 
Christmas would be primary in 
our minds once more. Too much 
emphasis has been placed on prac
tical values in which the down-toearth ideals of kindness and gen
erosity have been overlooked in 
the turmoil! Let us pause this 
Christmas in our speeded celebra
tion of superficial merriment to 
contemplate on the significance of 
the eason. The idea that all are 
not merely people living for the 
benefit achieved from others, but 
the thought that by giving we can 
often gain twice-fold would be 
one step further along the road 
to re-establishing the muchforgotten humanitarian principles 
signified by Christmas.

Christmas Oddities 
Gathered Overseas
In a little mountain town near 
Guadelupe, Mexico, the natives at 
the beginning of the Advent sea
son assume roles of various people 
who lived at the time of the Na
tivity. From the first Sunday of 
Advent, which is four weeks prior 
to Christmas, until the birthday of 
Christ these people live the roles 
which they have adopted. Thus, 
they enter into the real spirit of - 
Christmas by following in the 
footsteps of the holy people who 
lived long ago.
Among $he Italians, numerous 
pastries are made especially for 
the Christmas season. Tzapuli is 
made from a raised egg dough 
which contains nuts and raisins. 
The soft dough is fried in deep oil 
till reddish brown. After removal 
from the hot oil, they are drain
ed of the excess and eaten! Cassad, commonly called Gonalies, 
consists of a filling made of a 
semi-cured rigotti (an Italian cot
tage cheese), orange and lemon 
peel, nuts, and a variety of spices 
and other tempting fruits. This 
filling is stuffed into a pre-cooked 
egg ball, after which the whole is 
eaten.
One custom which is practiced 
among many of the Europeans is 
the attendance at midnight mass. 
This custom has spread to this 
country so that people of all de
nominations are now attending 
services at midnight on Christmas.
This year, during the Christmas 
season, Merry Christmas will 
sound something like houska 
cola in Finland; feliz navidad 
in Spanish; buona natali in 
Italy; froeliche weinachten in 
Germany; vroolijke kerstrus in 
Holland; joyeus noel in France;

Traditionally, the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology awards 
scholarships to encourage the pur
suit of higher education. These 
awards are presented to those 
students who have distinguished 
themselves by brilliant academic 
work and who need financial as
sistance. These scholarships are 
of two kinds: awards to entering 
students, known as Evening Car
negie Scholarships, and awards 
to students who have been in at
tendance during the previous year, 
known as Evening Honor Schol
arships.
To be eligible to compete for an 
Evening Honor Scholarship, a stu
dent must have successfully com
pleted the preceding college year 
in one of the regular undergradu
ate evening programs at the Car
negie Institute of Technology, and 
must have earned a minimum 
quality point factor of 2.75 on 
all of the work scheduled, includ
ing the supplementary term, if 
any. A student must also carry a 
schedule averaging at least six at
tendance hours per week for the 
year (in the department of 
Music, at least 18* units for the 
year) exclusive of the supple
mentary term.
Students who wish to be con
sidered for these scholarships must 
file an application at the office of 
the Registrar before August 10 
of each year. Blanks for this pui 
pose may be obtained at the Re? 
istrars office.
