Chinese Drama 
Premiered Here
Lute Song is a dramatization of 
one of the greatest Chinese classical 
plays, made by Sidney Howard 
about ten years ago. Mr. Howard 
was always very anxious to see this 
play produced, but aside from a 
brief and hurried summer tryout, it 
has not been done. The play was 
called to the attention of Miss Mor
ris last summer by Aline McMahon. 
It has been considered for a special 
matinee production by Miss Mc
Mahon and members of the Eve of 
St. Mark company then playing in 
New York City. Miss McMahons 
interest in the play continued and 
she suggested that a tryout at a 
school, such as Carnegie Tech, might 
be of profit both to the school and 
to those now handling the play. It 
is hoped that Mr. Howard and oth
ers from New York City might 
come out to see this production.
We have been fortunate in finding 
in Pittsburgh a fine musician, Miss 
Bernice Austin, who lived for a 
number of years in China, and who 
owns not only the scores of many 
ancient Chinese melodies, but also, 
several Chinese instruments which 
will be used in the production. Miss 
Austin is supervising the musical 
part of the production together with 
Miss Henrietta Rosenstrauch, of the 
Carnegie Tech Music Department.
While most of the traditional ar
rangement and business of the Chi
nese theatre are retained in the 
writing of the play, and will be in 
the production, it is neither Mr. 
Howards object nor ours in produc
ing it to stress these elements, but 
rather to bring out the clear beauty, 
wisdom, and depth of the Chinese 
text. The theme is that of philial 
piety which is most common in 
Chinese plays.
There will also be several dances 
of a ritualistic nature, created and 
directed by Genevieve Jones for 
the production.
Mr. Weninger is designing the 
settings for Lute Song. The drops 
to be used will take advantage of 
the decorative qualities of design 
which are found in Chinese prints. 
The color schemes and simulated 
embroidery patterns of the banners 
and throws which will be hung on 
the railing will designate the locale 
of the various scenes. Pots of flow
ers will be placed in front of this 
railing to designate the season.
The principal parts in Lute 
Song will be played by Adelvne 
Roth, Marilyn Bloom, Cecele Strober, Beulah Frankel, Ethel Gerson, 
Phyllis Leon, Clark Marlor, Lois 
Nosich. Mark Patterson, Rita Sheinman, Jack Hochhuser, and Frank 
Stevens.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANMONDAY, APRIL 10, 1944
Qditank A'vmcltai'L
Again the grip of total war has tightened aronud Carnegie Tech with a 
grim reminder that in this fight for survival each and everyone of us is in
volved. The quota system of deferments established under the National Roster 
of Scientific and Specialized Personnel has been rescinded completely, and it 
will be again up to the individual draft boards to grant deferments to students.
This is not a cheerful Easter message for the students and for the Admin
istration. It is a bombshell shattering the hope of survival for most frater
nities, the chance of continuing intramural sports and publications on anything 
like the present standards. To the administration this heralds hard times 
with the enrollment dwindling to unknown lows, and with classes reduced to 
a handful of students.
And yet, it was Easter two days ago, and the message of that holy day 
shows us the bright side of this unexpected event. Now we can hope for the 
rejuvenation which comes after a bitter fight, the complete resurrection pos
sible only after total downfall. Those of us who will join the armed forces 
will come out of the war better men and better citizens for the experiences 
behind us, and those who will stay at Carnegie Tech will be purged of all com
placency, all mental goldbricking by the constant uphill fight for survival they 
will have to battle. And when we shall be together again after the war, 
matured yet rejuvenated by our past, we shall see the school in a new light, 
attaching hitherto unknown values to the benefit of a good education and a 
peaceful and unworried college life.
We beg the students indulgence with the unusual brevity of this issue. 
No issue was planned for this week, and this is therefore an Extra necessitated 
by the unexpected change in the deferment status.
