cording to Barbara Davis, presi
dent of Womens Guild, will be 
used to endow further a benefit 
scholarship fund for a girl who 
will be selected before the open
ing of the fall semester.
The Womens Guild is an all
school organization whose mem
bers are drawn from every club 
in which women are active. 
The Guild sponsors a dance ev
ery year in order to build up its 
scholarship fund. The girl who 
receives this fund is selected joint

the faculty.
Students Win 
Bridge Match
Keneth Gar linger and Joseph 
Lux, Carnegie Tech undergradu
ates, became the first two college 
students to take a first place posi
tion in the records of the Monongahela Valley Bridge Tournament 
when they won the Mens Pair 
Division of that tournament last 
Friday at the Fort Pitt hotel.
Twelve couples were compet
ing, including some of the best 
players in the Tri-State area.
Garlinger is a senior in the 
drama department, and Lux is a 
chemical engineering sophomore. 
Each has been playing bridge for 
a number of years and has won 
in numerous local tournaments.
WCIT Resumes 
Broadcasting
Better Programming, 
Reception Promised
WCIT resumed broadcasts this 
term with improved reception 
and programs. The broadcasting 
schedule has been recast, with the 
afternoon variety club consolidat
ed with the evening schedule. This 
well-known Wednesday afternoon 
live broadcast, under the direction 
of Jay Atman, will now appear 
Wednesday evening at seven 
oclock beginning after the Easter 
vacation. 
New programs begin again this 
week at seven p.m. The first is the 
Sigma Nu variety show with How
ard Bach as MC and Betty Lou 
Kaufman handling the vocals. A 
program or records requested only 
by girls completes the hour. Re
quests for this and other programs 
can be filled by calling the sta
tion phone, Schenley 7277, or 
dropping a note to WCIT inter
school mail.
Continuing from last term is the 
Carnegie Theatre of the Air Wed
nesday of every third week at 7 
p.m. On April 7 will be the first 
full hour presentation, Liliom, 
the story from which the music 
for Carousel was taken.
Better reception was the goal 
of a series of technical expansions 
started last term. The latest move 
has been the placing by WCIT of 
a master transmitter in the base
ment of the Grill. Reports from 
the fraternities and dorms indi
cate that the reception is almost 
at standard broadcast level.

Wins By 22-18 Vote: OHare 
Re-Elected As Vice-President
Theodore Ulrich of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity is the new 
president of Student Council.
Upon winning the top position on campus by a 22-18 vote 
on the second balloting, he immediately assumed offifce.
IAC runner-up J. K. OHare automatically became vicepresident. This will be OHares second semester in the office.
During an interview after his election, Ulrich commended 
George Marshall, president of Council last semester, for his 
fine work in improving relations between Student Council and
? the administration.
Expressing the hope that there 
would be more cooperation among 
the students, he announced his 
support of the National Student 
Association, adding that only the 
students should decide whether 
Carnegie should affiliate with the 
national group.
Reiterating that the NSA is a 
body representing all college stu
dent governments, Ulrich recall
ed that CIT had the opportunity 
to be on the ground floor in the western Pennsylvanfa district.
In addition to being a fraternity 
member and Student Council rep
resentative from the College of 
Engineering, Ulrich is a member 
of ODK, Pi Tau Sigma, and Theta 
Tau. His future plans as Coun
cil president also include coop
eration with Delta Skull in its 
proposed attempt to revise the 
mens activities points system.
At the Council meeting the fol
lowing items were approved: 
Mens Glee Club budget for a 
spring concert to be given May 
26; award of a silver key to Rob
ert Smith for his work as news 
editor of the Tartan; and the re
quest by Sigma Nu fraternity for 
permission to hold a formal dance 
on May 22.
Results of the Student Council 
election of March 11 and of a re
cent Scottie staff election also 
were approved. New members of 
the Scottie staff include William 
Bourke, associate editor; Louise D. 
Miller, features editor; A1 Kiefer, 
publicity manager; William K. 
Brent, circulation manager; and

excepting matinees, will b^ avail
able to Carnegie Tech students 
Wednesday, March 31, at 4 p. m. 
in the drama office..
After its run in the Little The
atre, the play will go on tour to 
six Pittsburgh high schools. The 
high schools scheduled for per
formances are: Westinghouse,
Taylor Allderdice, Allegheny, 
Carrick, Langley, and Schenley.
Taming of the Shrew is giv
en by a group of traveling play
ers for the benefit of Christopher 
Sly, a drunken Tinker. In the 
plays introduction, Sly, played by Fred Miller and Norman Keats, is 
made sport of by a lord (Sanford 
Friedman and Robert Nathe) and 
his huntsmen, who persuade Sly 
that he is a noble lord suffering 
from lunacy for the past fifteen years.
Enjoying their hoax, the lords 
attendants wait on Sly hand and 
foot, and even go so far as to in
troduce him to his lady love who 
is really a page in a womans 
disguise. The players then arrive; 
the lord hires them to perform a 
comedy for the drunken tinker, 
and the play begins.
Baptista (Vincent OBrien and 
Robert Reynolds), a rich old gen
tleman of Padua, is beset by the 
problems of marrying off his two 
daughters. The youngest, Bianca 
(Sada Thompson and Mary Liz 
Kane), has many suitors, but they 
are detained until a husband can 
be found for the eldest daughter 
Katherina (Ruth Guberman and 
Jane Hughes), a s'nrew.
Petruchio (Louis Edmonds and 
Joe Schlafman), a gentleman 
from Verona, arrives in Padua 
seeking a rich wife. He is told of 
Katherina and warned about her 
shrewishness, but that doesnt stop 
Petruchio. Wealth is his object, 
and he is quite confident that he 
can tame the shrew.
He easily wins the hand of 
Katherina and then proceeds to 
tame her. Katherina, bewildered 
by her husbands mad antics, is 
entirely cured of all shrewishness, 
and Petruchio wears the pants in the family evar after.
Costumieres

Members of the MMCC costume 
economics department have been 
winners in two recent creative de
sign competitions.
Marilyn Allshouse, C & T Jun
ior, won the $25 award for the 
best entry in a contest to design

Editorial
Lets Open House
. The open house of the department of metal
lurgical engineering, scheduled from 9:30 
a. m until 4:30 p. m. on March 24, will be well 
worth attending, if only to get a glimpse of 
some of the modern methods and equipment 
which are nowr being applied to this most an
cient of arts, and of the diverse fields to which 
metallurgy can now be applied.
Much of the fundamental theory behind 
these methods and in back of many of the 
most important advances which have been 
made in the technology and science of metals 
has been developed in the department of metaliurgy and in the associated Metals Research 
laboratory; -
h This open house is, however, not without 
precedent. Remembering vague tales from our 
freshman year of all-school   Exhibition 
Nights,  during which one wfas free to become 
inquisitively lost in the oily, metallic gloom of 
the lower floors of Machinery hall or in musty 
wooden corridors of the upper part of Fine 
Arts, we searched through the Tartans files 
of. back issues.
The last full scale open house appears to 
have been held on April 25, 1941 (an event 
which the Tartan commemorated with a 12- 
page issue in standard newspaper format). Ac
cording to Professor Harold Lang, who was 
chairman of the affair, the number of visitors 
from Pittsburgh and neighboring towns was 
estimated at 12-15,000.
War put an end to the 35-year-old tradi
tion thefollowing year. We suggest that 1948- 
1949 would be a good time to revive it.
For even if it were limited to students of 
Carnegie Tech and to specially invited guests 
(by foregoing the usual external publicity), it 
would provide a fascinating kaleidoscope of 
related subjects and fields of knowledge poles 
and even dimensions apart from the individual 
sftudents own private educational world, 
r This knowledge and information, as such, 
is hot essential to even the best of CIT, but 
it does help to promote the beginnings of what 
Dr. Max Schoen liked to describe as the edu
cated man. ' ' -
A better integration of the student body, a 
fuller realization on the part of both students 
and faculties of the functioning and purposes 
of other departments, and a chance for a num
ber of students to practice the skills incident 
to the production, operation, and public expla
nation of the^ varied, exhibits would be fur
ther and almost equally important benefits,
Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
Knowing full well the speed with which term 
paper time comes, and having given up all hope 
of Provost Smith rescinding his 50 page minimum 
order, I sauntered forth one day last week, clip
board in hand, to collect a bibliography.
Since the only library the city of Pittsburgh 
has to offer is a broken-down excuse for a second 
hand newspaper morgue I hied me away to the 
school libraries. First, I decided to look up some 
Congressional committee hearings pertinent to my 
topic.
Have you ever been in the government docu
ments section of the main library? What an ex
perience. Some of the older material is fairly well 
indexed but the stuff which I wanted was, accord
ing to the librarian, . . . somewhere in the stack, 
go ahead and lookIll be up in a minute.
After about an hour of serious looking I had 
found practically nothing and the librarian still 
hadnt shown up, so I decided to give the theoreti
cal material a bit of a try firstso off and away 
to the Soc Rel library.
There the catalogue told the story. Everything 
I wanted was either circulating, not in, or in the 
mathematics section of the science library. 
But the books in the math section of the science 
library had been splitsome, including mine, go
ing to form the mathematics library. So off I 
trudged again.
The math library is small. Ergo, I shall have 
no trouble finding what I want. But I spent thirty 
minutes waiting for the conclusion of a meeting 
which was being held in the library.
So, after two and a half hours I found two 
books, both, incidentally, very good. But by that 
time they had to be. I imagine that my experience 
is not a unique onethat there are many of you 
who have had similar ones.
It would be unfair though, to say that the peo
ple in charge of the library dont do a good job. 
They probably do, but they are certainly labor
ing under institutional difficulties. In the first place, 
there isnt adequate space. Finding what you are 
looking for is difficult enough, but then the libra
ries are so crowded that studying in them is really 
a trying proposition.
Two more of the greatest needs of our libraries 
are, I think, a better indexing job and a sensible 
fine system, which does not encourage people to 
take books without checking them out for fear of 
paying a fine which approaches the national debt.
All the library personnel, and all the students, 
are looking forward to that day when the library 
building in the big glass case in front of Industries 
becomes a reality, but in the meantime we would 
certainly appreciate some attempt on the part 
of the administration to alleviate the present sad 
state.
Letter To The Editor
Bell and Johnson Ask 
Action on Skibo Food
Responsibility for implementing recommenda
tions of the Student Council Food committee now 
rests with the administration. The committee plac
ed a special emphasis on making an unbiased 
study; every factor relating to the operation of 
Skibo was considered, consultations were held 
with the director of food service, and compari
sons were made with similar institutions and com
mercial restaurants.
The investigation revealed a definite basis for 
the dissatisfaction expressed by members of the 
student body. Prices, quality, and service are the 
factors which were found to require adjustment.
While comparisons between Skibo and commer
cial establishments may be difficult owing to dis
similar operational problems, it would seem ob
vious that a non-profit organization could provide 
more satisfactory service. Although it is usually 
possible to buy a well-balanced meal at Skibo, 
the cost of such a meal is beyond the budget limi
tations of the majority of students.
On the basis of our investigation, we request 
that immediate action be taken to improve condi
tions in the cafeteria. The urgency of the problem 
merits special attention because it affects the 
health and financial position of every student at 
Carnegie. ,

Geologists Developing Methods 
To Increase Oil Field Recoveries
By A. Starke Drischell
It might be fun, if it were pos
sible, to slide down to the bottom 
of an oil well and have a look 
around. But Id think twice if I 
had to look forward to a climb 
back to the surface. For there are 
wells in Pennsylvania that reach 
to a depth of two miles. Thats 
what I learned one day when, 
ignorant of oil wells, I had a talk 
with a member of the geology de
partment here at CIT.
Geology can be interesting stuff, 
I found out that day, after wan
dering up wrong stairways twice 
in Industries hall before finding 
the department. And it can open 
the eyes to distressing facts I also 
found out. For there is no wan
dering around the fact that men 
who are in the know are deeply 
concerned about how long our oil 
reserves will last in this country. 
Fifty years some authorities say, 
and fifty years from now a lot of 
us will be alive, may even have 
cars.
Carnegie Tech is at present do
ing research on two aspects of this 
vital problem.
The first is the analyzing of 
samples from all the deep wells 
in the State, some as deep as two 
miles, as I have mentioned. The 
data gathered are used to evaluate oil and gas possibilities in those 
areas.
But they arent stopping there. 
They are working on an even 
more interesting and revealing 
problem, one which indicates by 
its very nature the seriousness of 
the declining oil reserves. For
they are studying oil fields that 
have reached exhaustion by the 
present methods.
You can see the implications of 
this study.
New methods of bringing oil to 
the surface are being devised. At 
present the method used depends 
upon utilizing the energy already 
underground in the reservoirs to 
force the oil up. If youre inter
ested, this is called primary re
covery.
Now with the new methods, 
called secondary recovery, the 
oil is brought to the surface by 
energy supplied from outside, 
from the surface.
In this connection, the Geology 
department here at CIT is study
ing the exhausted fields to deter
mine the extent of additional oil 
supplies which can be obtained 
by the newer methods.
Metallurgy
[Continued from page 1]
Arthur Conrad, and Raymond Mc
Farland have charge of physical 
and mechanical metallurgy.
Students from all three colleges 
are invited to attend this ex
hibit. Many prominent national 
industrial leaders, members of 
the AIME, have also been asked 
to attend.
Seminar professors and fresh
man mentors particularly are ask
ed to come in order that they may 
become better able to advise the 
students whom they are super
vising.

Split-Emanon repeated their last 
years triumph by walking away 
with the Intramural bowling 
championship. Three men from 
last years team figured in last 
Saturdays victory over the Citcom Clan.
The playoff was determined by 
a five-game total pins score. SplitEmanon came out on top with a 
margin of 98 pins in a match that 
featured some of the best bowl
ing of this season. Both teams 
turned in their best scores of the 
year, both individually and col
lectively, resulting in close games 
all the way.
Defarrari led the losers with a 
913 five game series while Carey 
had an 877 for the Splits, closely 
followed by Hradnansky at 875.

had 19 points and Motter 18 for 
the Kappa Sigs in the game 
against the 49ers who really live 
up to the first part of their name 
when theyre on the basketbalj, 
court. They put on the best com
edy skit the gym has seen for 
quite a while.
The PiKAs won two games this 
week but still felt Emanon and 
Beta As breathing on their necks. 
A win over the lowly Dorm team 
will put the PiKAs in the play

in Beta As win over ATO 59-21.
The Betas came back later in the 
week to wallop 3A 61-33 despite 
Gordons 19 points for the losers.

on the court as they lost both of 
their starts to drop from second 
to fourth place. The TXs, who 
moved up in the standings, hand
ed the DUs their first loss 34-26. 
Oxley had 16 points in the TXs

Letter To The Editor
Evening Instructors:
Editor, The Plaid:
Now that someone has opened 
the topic of instruction and in
structors for discussion, I would 
like to add my opinion. In the 
March 16th issue of the Plaid, F. 
M. stated that the student rather 
than the instructor is to be blamed 
for the ill-feelings of some even
ing students towards their instruc
tors. Maybe F. M. doesnt have to 
put in eight or more hours of hard 
work every day. After a day of 
hard work a student is not always 
at his best when it comes to study
ing or especially receptive to new 
items of knowledge imported by 
a hurried instructor.
He asked if everyone had all 
their assignments ready in time
and put in extra time on hard 
subjects. What Evening School 
student doesnt do this! It stands 
to reason that he puts forth spe
cial effort in all subjects or he 
would not be in Evening School. 
It is not easy to work all day then 
study at night.
That was a little off of the sub
ject of Instructors. I have noticed 
that several instructors really 
pour it on. It may be the manner 
in which the courses are planned, 
but the material really seems to 
fly.
So in closing, I would like to 
say that I think F. M. was too 
hasty in putting all the blame on 
the students. Lets hear some 
more comments on this subject 
from your other Evening Students 
G. D.
48 Banquet Planned 
As Outstanding Event
The time is drawing near for the thirty-third annual engineers 
banquet of the Evening College of Engineering. As the great event 
approaches, there is a noticeable stirring of the engineering body. 
As in the past, the engineers banquet is the outstanding social event 
of the school year; a time when the men of the evening school can 
acquaint themselves with fellow students in classes other than their 
own. All the gentlemen of the evening school, in addition to the 
engineering school, are invited to#------------------------------------
attend. Those who attend may 
bring guests if they so desire. 
Lets make this banquet the most 
successful ever held at Carnegie 
Tech. Its up to you, boys.
The committee is very well 
pleased with the bountiful supply 
of souvenirs and door prizes 
which have arrived for distribu
tion at the banquet. Following 
the policy of previous years and 
expanding operations a bit, the 
committee with the splendid aid 
of the girls at Tech have solicited 
well over 300 industrial concerns 
all over the nation for any door
prize or souvenir material they 
wish to present for advertising 
purposes. We cant tell you what 
has been received, but we can 
guarantee many surprised fellows 
when the bonanza is uncovered.
Ticket sale has been progress
ing at a brisk rate and we urge 
that you secure tickets at your 
earliest convenience. Many groups 
have been purchasing blocks of 
tickets and, where the size of the 
group warrants it tables will be reserved in its name.
As a reminder, the banquet is 
being held at the Hotel Henry Saturday evening, April 10.
A message to
I
you from the
Chief of Staff
-April 6 is Army Day. It is a day which will 
have a special meaning for college men. More than 
half of you are veterans of the last war. Many of 
you are members of the Organized Reserve. Many 
others belong to the R.O.T.C. or National Guard.
"All of you are making a vital contribution 
toward World Peace and the security of this 
nation.
"The U. S. Army is the finest army in the 
world and the only one of its kind among the 
major powers. It is 100% volunteer. It is com
posed entirely of civilian soldiers . . . men like 
yourselves who realize that a strong America is 
a peaceful America, and that the responsibility 
of making America strong rests in the hands of 
every American citizen.
"The U. S. Army is not a large army, as 
armies go. It is shouldering tasks far greater than 
any other army of like size has ever attempted.
Our occupation force in Japan is-the smallest per 
capita of any modern occupation army. Our force 
in Europe is the smallest of the three major powers.
"But behind this Army stand you men of the 
Organized Reserve and the R.O.T.C. I have 
known many of you personally. I have been with 
many of you in action. I know the fine type of 
men you are and the realism that leads you 
to equip yourselves with military training.
"Further, I know the valuable service you 
can render the nation in time of emergency. A 
great deal of the success of fast mobilization and 
the actual winning of the war was due to the 
106,000 trained Reserve Officers and the topnotch National Guard units which were avail
able for quick action.
"To you, on Army Day, I believe I speak for 
millions of Americans in offering commendation 
for the fine job you are doing.
You can get full details about the opportunities open to 
you In the Armys complete military training program at 
any If. S. Army and U. S. Air Force Recruiting Station,
