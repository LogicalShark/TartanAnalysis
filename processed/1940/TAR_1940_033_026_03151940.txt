Heart Attack 
Kills Panella
Louis J. Panella, part-time in
structor in the Department of 
Music since 1914, died on Wed
nesday as the result of a heart 
attack. Mr. Pahella, who taught 
trumpet at Carnegie, was well 
known for the many marching 
songs' that he had composed. He 
was 59 years old.
In addition to.teaching and. com
posing Mr. Panel In had played 
with several local orchestras and 
had been connected with the old 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
Composing had been difficult 
for him during the last five years 
of his life due to failing eyesight, 
but with the assistance of his 
brother, Mr. Panella overcame 
this difficulty. Frank, his brother, 
who is known for his composition 
the Old Grey Marc, aided Mr. 
Panella by listing the notes as he, 
played them and by arranging the 
compositions.
Among the tunes written by Mr. 
Panella are On the Square, the 
Pitt Panther, Tech Tartan 
March, Amerita, the Over
ture of Overtures and a popular 
melody of fifteen years ago, "Car

They Kcply
Architects Arise in Self Defense?
By Chuck Foully
Of late the reputation of the 
Architect seems to have acquired 
a tinge of odium. The callow stor
ies which have dragged up long 
forgotten shadows of the past are 
mere calumnies, generally discred
ited by those in the know; there is 
no need to refute them. In real
ity the Architects rank among the 
cream of intellectualsyou know 
members of the intelligentsia. 
And what have they done to 
prove that?
About a month ago, practically 
the whole department engaged 
in a scientific investigation of the 
psychology o' Mice. A small 
mouse was discovered wandering 
aimlessly about the corridors and 
following a generally pomtless 
existence. We decided to show it 
a broader aspect of life. We did
NOT scare women with it, we did 
NOT drop it out of a third story 
window on a Professor. We also 
did NOT shoot it out of a straw 
and we do NOT attempt to ig
nite the Hut with it. We DID 
make an exhaustive survey-of its 
mental and physical capabilities.
With typical architectural in
genuity, we constructed a maze. In 
the maze we placed the mouse 
Shirleythe reason for the am
biguity of the name is obvious. 
At first Shirley was a litle be
wildered by its new environment; 
it was on the verge of becoming 
neurotic. It ran hither and yon in 
a vain attbmpt to escape. Kind 
treatment, however soon correct
ed that unfavorable attitude and 
thereafter Shirley was quite tract
able.
It proved its sure-footedness by
climbing a cardboard spiral, about 
as high, comparatively, as Mach
inery Hall tower. Its intelligence 
was conclusively demonstrated by 
its ability to find cheeseamong 
other things. Among the things it 
does not like are water color, cig
arette smoke, or egg salad sand
wiches. Shirleys physical dimen
sions we found to include four 
legs, two eyes, two ears.and a tail, 
one and a half inches in length by 
three^eighths inches at the base 
and tapering to almost nothing at 
the end.
In the end, we let it go, a young 
disciple of science into the world 
of mice. Besides it got careless 
about sanitation. However we 
proved beyond doubt that you 
may drivp a mouse to water but 
you cant make it take a bath.

Anaeriean Syinp.illiies. Trade 
Make Treaty Dangerous
Reaction to the RusHian-Finnisli Treaty has come faster 
than the usual reaction to a sudden change in the status of an im
portant international incident. There seems to be no confusion. 
It is clear that to Germany and Russia it was a great victory; 
to the Allies a great blow; to Scandinavia, Holland, Belgium, 
Rumania, and the Balkans, a great threat; to Italy, as the Ger
man coal agreement implies, it means a swing to Hitler; and 
to the United States it means a recharting of its foreign policy 
to meet new European problemspvl
To students gathered around newspapers, the current ques
tion is: What does it mean to us? Are we closer to war? 
The answer is clear also, Yes, we are.
The United States bears somewhat the same relationship 
to the Allies that Russia does to Germany. The United States 
is supplying the Allies with arms and suxjplies, and now Russia 
is free to do the same. The United States claims that its help 
is   everything short of war. The Russian newspaper   Pravda  
reported Wednesday, March 13, that the Soviet state follows 
its own independent policy and will not let itself be involved 
in a war entailing innumerable calamities for the peoples of the 
world.' This attitude is somewhat similar to our own.
The danger to the United States will be continued German 
victory.  How long the United States army and navy will re
frain from following the sympathies, supplies, and arms already 
furnished to the Allies by the civilian population, is as much 
a question as whether or not Russia is sincere in stating that she 
fought Finland only to shut off a point of attack by England 
and France. Two points of interest arise from the latter ques
tion. First, now that the Finnish war is over, the fears of 
IitLssia are corroborated, as the following quotation shows, 
(from Pgh. Press, release by W. II. Stoneman, dated London, 
March 13) There is now little or no possibility of a northern 
front in the war between Germany and the Allies. Second, 
the fact that Russia would invade Finland at great cost in order 
to prevent possible attack by the Allies, and prevent an Allied 
ffcont against Germany, shows that, Russian fear of the Allies is 
strong, and her ties to Germany equally strong.
Russia plus Germany would present a dangerous front to 
the Allies this spring. The Allies would probably plead for 
holj^ from their No. 1 hand-maiden; and if experience means any
thing, the United States will answer obediently.
Historians will have trouble cataloging the next war. The 
Revolution was a war of liberation, the War of 1812 was fought 
because our traders took the word liberty too seriously, the | 
Oiyil War was one of self-preservation;" the Mexican War I 
was imperialistic, as was the Spanish-American, and the World m 
War saved the world for . . . etc. But imagine with what I 
oinharrassmont historians will describe the next war as, An I 
attempt to save our friends, namely, England and France, from 
!;wo European bogcy-men.

Jones Writes 
On Cagliostro
Count Cagliostro and Egyptian 
Masonry, an article by Dr. Web
ster N. Jones, Director of the Col
lege of Engineering, appeared in 
the last issue of the Hexagon of 
Alpha Chi Sigma.
The exploits of the famed Cagliostroi mystic, philosopher and 
alchemist, have attracted the at
tention of such great authors as 
Goethe, Dumas and Carlyle. 
Through the many stories written 
about him, the life of Cagliostro 
has become a romantic semimythical tale. In his article; Dr. 
Jones portrays Cagliostro as he
really wasa man who was 
probably one of the most consum
mate frauds of all time.
Cagliostro, born Beppo Pietro, 
after a rascally boyhood learned 
chemistry and medicine in a con
vent. Realizing the possibilities 
of the use of chemical phenomena 
in his plan for: swindling the ig
norant superstitous people of the 
time, he ran away and began a 
life of trickery. He married the 
bautiful Lorenza Feliciana who 
became his partner in crime. They 
lived for years in wealth, and in 
1776, perpetrated their most ex
pert schemeOccult Freemasonry 
or Egyptian Masonry. They were 
soon acclaimed all over Europe 
and adored by millions. The 
Count, however, overestimated his 
strength and spent his last years 
in prison.

S: (sardonically) Oh, no, its 
just a harmless game.
F: Does anyone ever win?
S: The machine is set up to pay 
out 25% of all the money it takes 
in.
F: In other words, if you play 
you cant win?
'That must really be a profitable
business. How much do the ma
chines cost?
S: The machines vary in cost 
from $87.50 to $110.00. The deal
er and the agent each take 50% 
of the profit. The dealer pays the 
mercantile tax of $21.50, which 
goes |:o the county, and the agent 
pays'a $25.00 tax which goes to 
the city-for each machine.
F: You mean that they make 
money even with these taxes? In 
other words, the state is cashing 
in on the gambling?
S: Thats right, brilliant. In 
Pennsylvania the state calls them 
recreational and isnt supposed 
to know that gambling is taking 
place. In Nevada the tax is $12.50

Your Job .
In a letter of application for a 
position, an accompanying data 
sheet has often been found useful. 
The use of such a sheet relieves 
the letter of a mass of routine 
detail. It lifts from the letter it
self the weigh of catalogued facts 
and puts them where they belong, 
in tabulated form on a separate 
sheet. In the space thus saved, the 
applicant, after careful sifting 
and selection, develops the most 
important points with conversa
tional treatment.
Many successful applicants use 
a data sheet attached as page two 
of their letter, patterning their 
applications in part upon the elab
orate printed information blanks 
of some companies. The applicant 
should shape the data sheet to fit 
his particular needs. Following are 
a few of the many headings which 
may be used:
1. General detailspersonal 
Name
Age
Nationality 
Present Address
2. Education

 . Hints For Girls
Employers, in criticizing college 
girls, have stressed two outstand
ing points: first, that they should 
not have a feeling of being better 
than other employees who per
haps do not have a college educa
tion; second, that they should not 
overlook neatness in appearance.
College girls generally think 
that they are too good to do rou
tine work in an organization. They 
are not willing to pay the price 
o? hard work. They refuse to do 
their best at little jobs in order 
to prove themselves worthy of the 
big ones. Their manner, during 
business hours, is social and per
sonal, rather than business-like 
and impersonal.
As to personal attributes, the 
importance of a pleasant, wellbred voice cannot be over-esti
mated. Dark, simple clothes are 
preferable, and accessories should 
be immaculate. Most employers 
thoroughly dislike fire, engine red 
finger nails and an overdose of 
lipstick.

SKIBO SPORTS SLANTS
PUNCHERS TO GIVE EXHIBITION 
TOMORROW
---- By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor  ---
Carnegie Tech's annual boxing exhibition will be held to
morrow in the gym at two oclock. The boys have been work
ing out for the past several months under the tutelage of Coach 
Ernie Sesto, and should be in shape to give a good show.
Under the present set-up boxing is on an intramural basis, 
thus this exhibition. Ernie assures us that the affair will be 
worth while, so take a few hours off tomorrow and look in on 
the boys while they proceed to mutilate each other. Maybe 
youll pick up a few pointers.
"TERRIFIC TARTANS TO GIVE ALL FOR FUND
The Terrific Tartans" will give all for the Finnish Relief 
Fund in a basketball game against the Pitt All-Stars at the Y. M. 
H. A. on March 28. Playing for the Tartans will be Whitey 
"The Mad Russian" Lee (the irony of it all), Johnny Lloyd, 
"Speedo Friedlander, Tiger Schmidt, Chang Dunn, and your 
correspondent.
The Pitt All-StarB team will be composed of Pitt football 
players.
The game is for a worthy cause, and a good hearty laugh 
is guaranteed every minute.
JOTTINGS ABOUT THIS AND THAT
All those interested in coming out for any spring sport 
should indicate their intention as soon as possible in order to 
facilitate getting under way. Meetings for tennis and golf 
have already been held; while there is a meeting of all track 
candidates this afternoon in the Trophy Room of the Mens Gym.
Because of the ineligibility of a few of last years track 
stars, there is a particular need for candidates.
* # # * #
Just a reminder to the groups participating in intramural 
athloticsthere is an all-activities cup to be given for that or
ganization compiling the greatest number of points throughout 
the year. The award is based on a point system arranged by the 
Intramural Board.
*****
The Penn State-Carnegie Tech basketball game marked the 
final appearance of one of Teoha greatest athletesRube Stark. 
The "Rube" has performed brilliantly for three years, compil
ing a scoring record exceeded only by ono other eager in the 
sohools history. Coach Max Hannum rates Stark as the best 
performer he has ever coached.
This game also was diminutive Jimmy Tumpanes final 
effort. Jimmy alBO has played on the varsity three years, dis
tinguishing lnmuclf by his aggressive play. .Although Jimmy 
has not boon a particularly high scorer, ho has been the steady
ing infiuonce that overy team must have.
It is almost superfluous to say that Max will miss these 
votorans noxt yoar.
Although Red Sturgeon is a Sonior, there is a possibility 
that ho will bo back noxt year, so wo wont bid him adieu.

PiKAs Win Eighth Straight Victory; 
Citcom Clan Takes Table Tennis Crown
By George Tondorf
Pi Kappa Alpha continued on 
the trail toward the basketball 
championship by notching their 
eighth consecutive Fraternity 
League triumph at the expense of 
the DU squad last Tuesday night.
Led by Ace Rankin, the Morewood men jumped off to an early 
lead and were never headed, 
winding up on the long end of a 
25-17 count. Rankin was high 
scorer for the winners with nine 
markers.
Meanwhile the slipping Tau 
Delts dropped their second deci
sion to the SAEs, 22-14, so that 
now it appears that nothing short 
of a miracle will keep the red-hot 
PiKAs out of the finals.

Randall Burch Elected 
1940-41 Cage Captain
Captain BurchNew Leader Is 
Veteran of Two 
Years On Varsity
At the termination of the final 
basketball game of the season, last 
Monday night in the Penn State 
Gymnasium, the Skibo hoopsters 
assembled and elected Randall 
"Red Burch, captain for the
1940-41 campaign.
Red, as he is known by all his 
friends, entered Carnegie in 1937, 
coming from Benton .Harbor High 
School, located in Benton Harbor, 
Michigan. While in High School 
Burch was rated as one of Ben
ton Harbors foremost athletes, 
being three years on the basket
ball team, serving two season as a 
member of the football and tennis 
squads, and placing as high man 
on the local cliibs golf team dur
ing his final year in school.
Since he has been at Tech, Red 
Randall has shone as brightly, 
serving in a regular capacity on 
the Tartan basketball squad for
Carroll Downs 
Tartan leers; 
Feiler Stars
They didnt quite make it, but 
the Carnegie Tech hockey team 
came as close to beating the John 
Carroll skaters as anybody has 
come in some time. When the 
final gong sounded last Tuesday 
night, the score was 3-2 in Car
rolls favor. Although outskated, outpassed, and outplayed, the 
Skibos were never outfought.
Meyers, of Carrollvs opened the 
scoring in the third minute of the 
first period on an unassisted shot 
from a close angle. In the same 
period, Wilson took a pass from 
Schilawske and made good his 
shot to tie the score at 1-1. In the 
last two minutes of the period, 
Carroll sent five men down the 
ice in an attempt to break the 
deadlock, and .were successful 
when IVTeyers passed to Rancourt 
who let fly a shot that came out 
of a mass of players milling in 
front of the cage and into the 
mesh before Feiler could get his 
eye on it.
In the eighth minute of the 
final period, Eddie Arsenault, 
after several unsuccessful at
tempts, broke lose to move in on 
Feiler and score Carrolls third 
goal. Once again Bob Church 
provided the thrill of the game 
when at 8:05 of the closing period 
he picked up a lose puck in the 
neutral zone and steamed in on 
Rancourt alone on defense.
A lot of Techs game stand can 
be credited to Goalie Fred Feiler 
who played as good a game in the 
cage as he has in two years, which 
is saying something because he has 
checked in with some remarkable 
performances. Against Carroll, he 
handled a total of 33 saves in 36 
minutes which is being plenty ac
tive. Art Burleigh. Verne Schi
lawske, and Bud Wilson did a fine 
job of tying up the vaunted Car
roll offense and still managing to 
chalk up a couple of goals them
selves. The whole combination al
most downed the league champs 
who have won every other game 
this year by at least three points.
Tomorrow afternoon, Burleigh, 
Schilawske, Ely, Herre, and Capt. 
Wilson close their collegiate 
hockey careers with an attempt to 
take over Duquesne for the first 
time in five encounters this year.
Cagers Drop 
Seasons Final
Last Monday night the Skibo 
hoopsters played the last game 
of the season at Penn State. The 
result was a defeat for our boys 
to the tune of 48 to 26. After the 
first few minutes of play the 
score stood at 8 to 8, but by the 
end of the first half the Lions had 
gained a lead of 15 points, the tal
ly at 26 to 11.
Rifle Team to 
Shoot Against 
Maryland U.
Girls Win Over 
Three Schools With 
High Score of 497
Today at the Rifle Range of 
the University of Maryland, four
teen ace xiflemen representing 
Carnegie Tech will try to beat 
the U. of Marylands riflers. Min
ton, Penburthy, Whittum, Reitz 
and Rathbun are shooting for the 
varsity, while Curry, Dietrich, 
Williams, Reichenecker, Obery, 
Evans and Ritchey are the plebe 
shooters. Tomorrow, at the Naval 
Academy in Annapolis, the Tar
tans will be the guests of the Nav
al Academy and will try to outshoot the future Admirals.
This weeks Postal Match was 
to have been shot against Navy 
and Maryland, but the returns 
were not sent in. The practice ses
sion this week gave Tech 1932, 
which should be bettered by at 
least 15 points in this afternoons 
postal matches in Maryland.
Girls Rifle Team Ends Season 
With an almost perfect score, 
the girls outshot Michigan, Ne
braska and California to end a 
successful season of rifling. Miss ' 
Novak and Miss Reich made per
fect scores of 100, while Misses 
Thomas, Purse, and Carlin missed 
only one point of being perfect. 
The 497 was about the highest 
score made by the girls this year. 
University of California made 
490, Nebraska shot 481, while Michigan had the total of 475 points.

two seasons, this year being fifth 
highest scorer in the city.
Not since the hectic days of 
Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen, Walt 
Hagen and Johnny Farrell, the 
latter three still playing quite a 
bit, has the golf field been so 
star-studded. The sensation of 
the winter season has been Jim
my Demaret who has won more 
contests and money than any other 
pio. It seems incredible to me that 
they can put any time into their 
own golf courses for instruction 
with all of their contests away 
from home.
Competing with Jim for top 
honors during the coming year 
will be National Open Champ 
Byron Nelson, Paul Runyan, 
Ralph Guldahn, and three players 
who will hit the top in the next 
few years, Johnny Bulla, Ben 
Hogan, and Clayton Heafner. Tops 
in the amateurs will be Marvin 
Bud" Ward, Wil Wehrle, and
youngster Johnny Barnes.
It may be interesting to note 
what Bill Tilden, the old master 
of tennis, has said about a 19- 
year old Californian, Ted Schroeder. According to Bill, Ted will 
be the next Don Budge of tennis, 
and Bobby Riggs, who plans to 
retire after attaining three na
tional championships, will not be 
able to complete his task.
Early in January, I predicted a 
bright future for the sensational 
Welby Van Horn who reached the 
finals of the National tourney last 
year.

Wlml to Wear
Where?
ET POUR LES HOMMES
Checks are here again. Theyre 
spreading from two-tone checks 
and hound-tooth designs in sports 
jackets to socks, shirts, ties, and 
(shh) even underwear. Theyre 
very fine, but remember that mod
eration is the best policy, and 
dont wear a checked' shirt with 
a hounds tooth coat, or a check
ed pullover sweater over a dit
to tie. Red and blue checks seem 
to be in the lead, with white al
most always in the background. 
Incidentally, this pattern is also 
found on suspenders and belts in 
this day of high wide, and hand
some fashions.
POUR LES FEMMES

ponents of any suit. But definitely 
not just any suit is this threepiece outfit in Jaegers wool. The 
pleated skirt, and unlined wrap
around jacket are checked in lus
cious candy colorsturquoise, yel
low, white. The dashing cape is 
hunting pink whip-cord (very 
new, incidentally) and has wide, 
square shoulders. By the way, the 
pleats on the skirt are pressed 
down below thigt levelto add 
to that smooth look.
To go with this, how about a 
pair of the latest madpink 
suede toeless wedgee pumps. With 
the wedge striped in pink and 
blue youll go home for Easter in 
high style.
Something else unusual is a 
two-piece wool and silk jersey 
boelro outfit. Its tricky, though 
at first glance youd take it for 
three pieces. The flaring skirt and 
rib-length bolero are gray wool 
jersey with a narrow white pin 
stripe running vertically. As strik
ing contrast there is a plain, crew
necked silk jersey blouse which is 
joined to the skirt by a matching' 
gray and white sash.
You could add emphasis to this 
dress by wearing a pair, of wedgers in gray suede. These are made 
like moccasins-^with flat sole and 
round flap, over the instep, and tie 
with red and yellow suede laces. 
These shoes are the newest im
