AIEE Sponsors 
Writing Contest
Prizes amounting to $75.00 in 
cash are being offered by the 
Pittsburgh section of the Ameri
can Institute of Electrical Engi
neers for the best papers submit
ted by students of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, Pennsylva
nia State College, University of 
Pittsburgh, and West Virginia 
University. Dr. D. W. Ver Planck, 
of CITs electrical engineering 
faculty, is chairman of the local 
committee in charge of the con
test.
Purpose of the competition is 
to stimulate preparation of pa
pers by members of student 
branches of the society. Any regu
lar student member of A.I.E.E. 
who is registered as an undergrad
uate on April 8, 1947, may sub
mit a paper. The three best papers 
from each school will be submit
ted to the contest judges not lat
er than March 1, 1947. The four 
papers judged the best of this 
group will be presented orally by 
their authors at a meeting of the 
Pittsburgh section, A.I.E.E., on 
April 8, 1947. In selecting the final 
prize winners, the oral presenta
tion will be considered as well as 
the evaluation of the written pa
per. The oral presentation will be 
limited to ten minutes, but the 
written paper may be of any 
length.
Details for the selection of the 
entries from C.I.T. have not been 
announced, but they will be post
ed soon by the Executive Council 
of the schools branch of A.I.E.E. 
Further information concerning

Sing Scheduled 
For Chapel
Carol singing will be the fea

day, December 17. The program 
will begin at 11:30 a. m. in the 
hall of the Fine Arts building. 
As in the past, the entire audience 
will participate, supported by a 
choral group from the music de
partment.
This beautiful service was in
augurated in 1921 by the YMCA, 
under the leadership of Professor
B. C. Dennison, and has since been 
a tradition at C.I.T. Originally 
it was held in the Little Theater, 
but its popularity necessitated 
moving it into the main hall.
President Doherty will preside 
at the Chapel and will give a 
brief Christmas greeting.
Home Ec Club 
Adopts War Child
The latest project of the 
M. M. C. C. Home Economics 
club is the adoption of a war 
child whom -they will support for 
one year. The foreign-born child 
was obtained through the Foster 
Parents Plan, Inc., of New York.
The club members have never 
seen the child and do not know 
whether it is a boy or a girl, but 
they expect to receive pictures 
and a life history within a short 
time. Meanwhile they plan to 
send packages of clothing and ne
cessities and to correspond with 
him.
The support of the child will 
require $180 a year, which Home 
Economics Club members will 
raise by soliciting all students 
groups on the campus as well as 
the Home Economics faculty in 
Margaret Morrison. Christmas 
tree ornaments will be sold to add 
to the fund.

Editors Armchair
And So It Goes
This pause between Thanksgiving vacation and Christmas 
holidays finds C.I.T. in a state as close to self-contentment as
C.I.T. can be. Or so it seems from the editorial desk, for there 
are not even rumors of war. The campus gripes are run-of-themill, and there isnt a single letter to the editor on the desk bit
terly condemning blue jeans, female manners, lines in Skibo, or 
midsemester grades.
R. H. Coo hasnt stirred up another revolution; the indepen
dents havent attacked the fraternities; :the students havent 
petitioned the resignation of the entire faculty; the coal strike 
is postponed; and the United Nations delegates are agreeing. 
Even the weather to date has been faultless.
So, if those few and enduring readers who do glance at 
this column are hoping to find herein some hot and juicy ma
terial exposing or denouncing someone or something, they neednt 
read farther. This is going to be a dull editorial.
The only matter that needs to be brought to attention is that 
the open season for Student Council nominating begins today. 
If the students want an adequate selection of worthy candi
dates, now is the time to actnot after elections. The quality 
of Student Council depends entirely on the quality of the nomi
nees. All that is necessary to enter an able representative is a 
petition bearing twenty-five authentic signatures. For those who 
want a better Student Council, the time is now.
If we were Casey, which we arent or wed be writing 
End Man, it would be a shout to the wind for the basketball 
team, which promises a good season. We only hope that it re
ceives some enthusiastic support from the cheering section.
Speaking of cheering sections, we have begun to wonder 
whether the Alma Mater' shouldnt be called Song without 
Words. At least thats the way it sounded during football 
seasona few scattered hummers; a da-dummer here, and a lalaher there; and once or twice an alumnus booming forth with 
the WORDS. Its really a beautiful Alma Mater, in both word 
and music. We would like to hear the students do it justice 
some time.
Heretofore having omitted the traditional word to the fresh
men, we might use this space now for a passing comment. As the 
new organizations, Film Arts, W.C.I.T. Form, Student Feder
alists, begin piling up on campus, it is not infrequently that we 
grey-haired, stoop-shouldered seniors look enviously upon the 
lucky freshman. He is inheriting a great many phases of col
lege life that we dreamt about or planned. Perhaps, too, we are 
uneasy, afraid that he will not realize this good fortune and 
consequently not take advantage of it. In these times, it would 
be sad indeed to let the world go by, not to jump on the band
wagon, to stand apartinactive, passive. Well, thats just a 
passing comment.
Already these ramblings have used enough ink; so, unless 
the poor students want more pot-luck editorials, someone had 
better stir up some troubles somehow. Its much too peaceful at 
Carnegie.

The Passing Parade
By Carl Klahr
It is becoming increasingly ap
parent that the military occupa
tion of Germany is a flop! I dont 
especially refer to the scandal 
stories brought out in the latest 
Army report on the 300,000 odd 
troops the United States has sta
tioned there. Fraternization, high 
venereal disease rates, black 
market deals, and hoodlumism are 
not unusual in any military occu
pation, although the Army could 
certainly eliminate much of this 
by stationing adult soldiers in 
Germany instead of young boys, 
fresh out of high school, on the 
lookout for adventure . . .
But the real failure of military oc
cupation consists of this: Ger
many is still a Nazi country.
Every report we receive makes 
the picture clearer and clearer. A 
group of newspaper correspon
dents conducted a poll in Berlin 
and found that now19 months 
after the wars end55% of the 
German people would vote Nazi 
in a free election. Remembering 
that Hitler got into the saddle 
with only 44% of the vote, it is 
easy to see which way the Ger
man people will lean politically 
once the occupation forces pull 
up stakes. Even now young Ger
man men scrawl swastikas on 
the walls, longing for the good old 
days.
General Roger Moiret, head of 
the French Military Government 
and member of the Allied Con
trol Council, recently made this 
statement: If a leader arose who 
could reunite Germany, the entire 
people would follow him and re
nounce their personal freedom. 
And since many Germans believe 
that Hitler still lives, as indeed

he might, there is a chance that 
in our time we shall again see a 
Hitler-dominated Germany.
One would think that the Amer
ican and British people would rec
ognize the situation for what it 
isa festering sore-spot caused by 
a whole nation, incurable in its 
hate. But Americans persist in 
thinking of the Germans as 
penitent and progressing.
For instance, the Federal Coun
cil of Churches has invited Pas
tor Martin Niemuller to conduct 
a speaking tour starting in Seat
tle this week. Niemuller, you re
call, was clapped in a concentra
tion camp for eight years by the 
Nazis for opposing Hitlers anti
church policy. But when he was 
interviewed last year after Amer
ican soldiers released him, he said 
that he was as patriotic a German 
as anyone, that he had disagreed 
with Hitler on a point of policy, 
and that he had volunteered to 
serve in the Germany Navy as a 
submarine skipper, his role in the 
first World War. So here we see 
what we can expect of even the 
best of Germans. Not admitting 
their guilt in the face of the black
est crime in history, their Nazi 
creed of obedience and blind pa
triotism has not left them.
To be on the safe side we must 
have a perpetual occupation of 
Germany. Like Rome, we must 
poison Carthages soil with salt if 
we want to prevent her resurg
ence. A free, unified Germany in
evitably means a third and last 
world war.
Why then are the United States 
and British governments uniting 
their zones of occupation in Ger
many? The purpose, according to 
the official announcement, is to 
strengthen its enemy. Isnt this 
rather short-sighted?
"What we need in Germany is a 
man like MacArthur, a showman, 
who can dramatize our side of the 
story to the Germans as Hitler 
dramatized his. A man who can 
meet the Germans on their own 
ground, who would be ruthless to 
impress them. In view of MacArthurs brilliant record in the 
occupation of Japan, I suggest his 
transfer to Germany, where the 
need for him is much more ur
gent.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1046
Cagers Open With W. V. U. Tomorrow
Carnegie to Field Veteran Team; 
Capacity Crowd Expected For Tilt
Now that the football pads have been tucked away and winter 
is just around the corner, basketball comes into its own this week 
as the Tech hoopsters engage a strong West Virginia five in the gym 
tomorrow night. Game time is 8:30 p. m., with a capacity crowd ex
pected to be on hand for the curtain raiser.
The advance notices on the Mountaineers have been nothing 
short of breathtaking. Of the brilliant squad that finished third in 
last years National Basketball Tournament at Madison Square Garden, 
only two of the starting quintet have been able to make the first 
team this year. Carroll, who was the scoring star in last years Carne
gie-West Virginia game is presently at the bottom of the roster and
has not even been assigned a 
number.
As might be expected with such 
information as this going the 
rounds, Coach Bill Donahoe can 
hardly be expected to be very 
optimistic over the coming sea
son. Wild Bill feels that, while 
he has the makings of what would 
ordinarily be a good team, under 
the present conditions it is im
possible to judge just what the 
results will be. If the schools are 
as loaded with basketball talent 
as they were with football stars, 
not too much can be hoped for. 
Win Practice Game
But even with this pessimistic 
outlook the Tartans started off 
impressively as they journeyed to 
Butler, Pa., last week to take the 
measure of Deshon General Hos
pital by a score of 58-30. Coach 
Donahoe substituted freely 
throughout the game and held the 
score down. Big Paul Kuzma led 
the scoring for Carnegie, amassing 
a total of 10 points.
Four members of the starting 
five for tomorrow nights game 
call Pittsburgh their home. Tom 
Culbertson, a six-foot two-inch 
forward was a freshman sensa
tion here in the 1942-43 season. 
He also found time to play for 
Brown University as a V-12.
At one of the guard posts will 
be Tasso Katselas who led the 
Tartans in scoring two years ago 
with an average of 11.6 points per

will play the other guard, are 
each an even six feet tall. George 
graduated from nearby Central

three years for Coach Donahoe. 
This is also his third year of var
sity competition with the Skibos.
The fourth member of the Pitts
burgh quartet is Howie Levy who 
is the shortest member of the first 
team at five feet nine inches. 
Howie played for Tech during the 
43-44 and 44-45 seasons. He is al
ways a scoring threat.
At the center post is Paul Kuz
ma from Monessen, Pa. Paul is 
the tallest man on the team tow
ering six feet four inches. He was 
the high scorer in the Monessen 
Valley league in his senior year 
in high school and was voted to 
their All-Star team. He filled the 
pivot position quite adequately 
last year.

Since the paper went to press

The Tau Delts wound up on top 
of the proverbial pile in the touch

Quite a bit of volleyball has

Tech Returns To College Swimming; 
Many Candidaes Report For Drills
Starting Five
Katselas, Meyer, Donahue, Culbertson, Kusma, and Levy
Returning to the sports spot
light after a war-time absence, 
the Tech swimming team faces 
one of the toughest seasons in re
cent years. The team, a combina
tion of pre-war swimmers and 
post-war Techites, shows itself to 
be strong. With a schedule of 
twelve meets with some of the 
best teams in the East, Tech faces 
a rough season in its return to the 
college swimming circles. The 
Penn State meet will probably be
the highlight of the year.
With old "stalwarts as a nucleus 
and the promising candidates who 
have reported for the team, Coach 
Risedorph has abundant material 
to build an outstanding team. Bill 
Ferguson, returned breast stroker, 
Spiks Spangler, sprinter, and 
Stu Lee, diver, are all to be 
watched.
Stu Lee, an All-American from 
the Yale swimming team which 
starred Alan Ford, is one of the 
most promising divers Tech has 
seen in many years. Ferguson was 
Kansas state champion breast 
stroker and a continual threat in 
AAU circles last summer.
Spangler starred for Tech in 
the pre-war years, and is back 
again. Dave Luckey, a freshman, 
looks promising in the breast 
stroke, and among the sprinters 
Venzer and McMullen bear watch
ing. Although the season does not 
begin until after Christmas, the 
enfire team appears to be in top 
shape and prepared to win meets.

Tomorrow Coach Donahoe will unveil his first cage team at Tech. 
The opposition will be furnished by the highly touted West Virginia 
Mountaineers, and the result of the contest may prove disappointing 
to many Tech followers. But before we pass judgment on our own 
representatives let us consider a few important facts.
First of all, the team has had only two weeks of organized prac
tice, whereas most colleges have had two months or more. West Vir
ginia, for instance, issued its 
initial call during the first part 
of September. The result of such 
an undertaking is apparent. Bas
ketball is a game that calls for 
long and constant drilling in or
der to improve or even maintain 
a persons shooting and passing 
ability. However, Tech has re
verted to the Harry High School 
type of policy by appointing one 
man to fill two jobsfootball and 
basketballa rarity in college cir
cles. Being unable to perform the 
impossible feat of coaching two 
widely different games at the same 
time, Coach Donahoe was forced 
to abandon plans of pre-season 
drills, and wait until the end of 
the football season. Thus, Wild 
Bill has had only two weeks to 
organize a team. It is apparent 
that the team is in for a slow 
start and it wont be until mid
season that their true ability will 
be displayed.
Ordinarily we could easily 
predict the strength of an op
ponent according to their previous 
record. But these arent ordinary 
times, and Im afraid that were 
going to be up against the same 
problem that we faced in foot
ballteams loaded with return
ing vets.
Attention Mr. Havey Boyle: 
I think that you deserve some 
kind of a recognition for your 
sports column in last Thurs
days edition of the Post-Gazette. 
As you are not a Tech student or 
alumnus, I cant offer any orchids, 
but instead Id like to present to 
you one M-l-A-1 bucket of ma
nure which we use to make our 
orchids grow. You are supposed to 
be a sportsman, who, according to 
the code of ethics, never hits a 
man when he is down. Appar
ently, you are not a sportsman. 
Your remarks about our unfor
tunate football squad were slams 
against an amateur effort in a 
professional world.

fraternity, signals the initiation of 
a new tradition on the campus.
Plans for a presentation ban
quet have been cancelled at this

selected as the most valuable 
player of the year will be pre
sented with a replica of the per
manent trophy.
The trophy committee wishes 
to announce at this time that an
other election will have to be 
held Wednesday afternoon at 
four-thirty in the field house. Due 
to a misunderstanding of the rules 
by the committeeman who con

Pitt Captures First Intra-City 
Touch Football Championship, 7-6
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity of 
the University of Pittsburgh 
edged out Tau Delta Phi frater
nity of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology 7 to 6 to capture the 
first annual intra-city touchfootball championship before a 
thrilled crowd of several hundred 
spectators on Trees Field in the 
Universitys backyard.
A difference in the rules of the 
two schools was an advantage 
which the Tartan representatives 
were unable to overcome. Tech 
touch is played with eleven-man 
rules, while the Pitt game con
forms to the regulation six-man 
rules which do not permit the man 
who receives the ball from center 
to carry the ball across the line 
of scrimmage.
Pitt took the lead early in the 
game and held it throughout. 
John Gallagher, Pitts shifty 
backfield ace, faded to his own 
twenty and whipped a forty-yard 
pass to*Ralph Wilde who leaped 
high in the air, came down, and
stepped across the goal to open 
the scoring. A spot pass from 
Gallagher to Frank Dougherty 
tacked on the winning point.
The Tau Delts scored in the 
closing seconds of the first quar
ter directly following the PiKAs 
kick-off. With the ball on the Pitt 
29, just over the mid-field stripe, 
Sherman Cohen, triple-threat 
back, tossed a behind-the-line-ofscrimmage pass to Don Rubenfield. Rubenfield turned and flip
ped the ball to Buddy Yorkin who 
was traveling down the sideline. 
Yorkin took it on the ten and 
went down to the two before he 
was stopped by Dougherty. On the 
next play Cohen cracked through 
center to the one-foot line. Then 
faking an end run, Cohen shovelpassed to Stan Smith for the 
touchdown.
Dougherty kicked off to start 
the second half. Cohen took it on 
the 12 and moved to the 26. Two 
bad passes and a fifteen -yard 
clipping penalty put Teen in a 
hole. Cohen faded back to his end 
zone on the next play and whip
ped a 35-yard pass that hit Bud
dy Yorkin in the stomach for the 
first down. Morgan intercepted 
Cohens next aerial, and that was 
as far as the Tau Delts got in the 
second half.
Near the end of the game 
Cohen, standing behind his goal, 
threw all the way to the Pitt 
eleven in a desperate try to win, 
only to have Dougherty intercept 
again for the PiKAs.
The first few days of the month were 
once a time of feverish activity for tele
phone accounting personnel. In that 
short period millions of telephone bills 
had to be prepared, checked and mailed. 
But the Bell System accounting staff, 
seeking to level off this work peak, found 
a practical solution.
Its called "rotation billing.
Now in our accounting departments, a 
new month begins every few days. 
Accounts are divided into six or more
even groups, each with a different bill
ing date. This spreads the work evenly 
and eliminates the old last-minute rush.
This special problem, solved by tele
phone accountants, is typical of those 
which often confront management in 
the many branches of our business. They 
present a stimulating challenge to the

. . . Did any of you notice -that 
the members of the social com
mittee at the dance stayed clear 
of the crystal ball, something tells 
me that the mirrors were not 
too strongly attached. Oh well, 
none of them fell off. . . . Who 
was the recipient of all the warm 
greetings from the boys on her 
birthday? . . . She says she is 
now sweet 17. . . .To anyone 
short on cigarettes, we may be 
able to ease the situation by giv

First Evening Dance Attracts 
Splendid Student Turnout
Well, students, it seems as 
though our social affairs in Eve
ning school are back on the big 
time again with bigger and better 
dances to come in the future. The 
turnout was beyond all expecta
tions of the committee with scads 
of terpsichoreans being present at 
the Thanksgiving Dance which 
was held in Thistle hall. Every
one had a wonderful time dancing 
to the smooth and melodious 
music of Don Palmers band and 
listening to the pleasant voices of 
the Mellow Modes featuring Betty 
Greenwood.
There certainly was plenty of 
activity among those present at 
the dance, with informal groups 
gathering to introduce their 
wives, sweethearts, husbands, etc. 
Some had set up chairs in the 
gym as Thistle hall did not have 
enough space. All the tables on 
the edge of the floor were taken at 
the start of the evening. The 
Black Cat was overcrowded with 
enthusiasts trying to obtain re
freshments, while the lounge room 
across the hall was occupied to 
the last seat (even the last seat 
was taken.)
By the way, the Lamplighters, 
an organization of former evening 
students now enrolled in day 
school, were well represented. 
Comments passed around by the
Measurement Bureau Offers 
Guidance to Eve. Students
group ran something like this: 
It was the best evening school 
affair we have attended since the 
start of the war.
Considerable credit should be 
tendered Anne Shack, our Social 
chairman, who did a swell job of 
organizing the affair and follow
ing it through to the end. Chester 
Biscup, who supervised the dec
orating of the hall, John Vranic, 
Publicity chairman, Rosemary 
Eckles, Assistant Social chairman, 
and last but not least the fellows 
and gals who turned out to help 
decorate should also be thanked 
for their helpful cooperation.
For the benefit of those who 
did not attend, we suggest that 
when the next affair rolls around, 
you plan to attend, for you cer
tainly will have a good time.

The Bureau of Measurement 
and Guidance has always been an 
important factor in conducting en
trance examinations for the regu
lar day students at C.I.T. This 
year has marked the first in the 
bureaus examinations of entering 
evening students desirous of en
rolling in the college of Engineer
ing and Science. With this new 
function of the bureau, it was de
cided to maintain office hours in 
which the more general services 
of the bureau would be available 
to those students who were on 
campus in the evening.
These services are better ex
plained by the mentioning of the 
three main functions of the bu
reau. These are to aid in the se
lection of entering students by 
tests; educational and emotional 
counseling of students already ad
mitted, and research in guidance 
and selection problems. Among 
the many typical questions which 
confront students registering with 
the guidance bureau are choice of 
a major, confirmation of voca
tional choice already made but 
about which the individual is in 
some doubt, inadequate study 
habits, difficulty in reading effi
ciently, and personality inade
quacies of various natures, are 
prominent. The bureau endeav
ors to aid the individual with such
problems by the analysis of \the 
situation by psychological meth
ods.
The student is not given a direct 
answer without preparation and 
research being conducted on his 
particular problem. Tests are 
given, personal information is ob
tained from discussion with the 
student and from relevant voca
tional information. The counselor 
and student collaborate with the 
goal of aiding the student in solv
ing his problem by using modern 
and appropriate psychological 
techniques. At no time is the stu
dent prevailed upon to accept de
cisions other than those he had 
made himself. The student makes 
his own conclusions from relevant 
material brought to light by the 
counselor.
Dr. Watson heads the bureau, 
and is assisted by Dr. Moore, the 
counselor; Dr. Simpson, the read
ing specialist;-and Miss Lahti, the 
statistician. Dr. Moore is availa
ble for appointment in his office, 
Room 243, Industries hall, on 
Thursday evenings 6:30 to 9:00. 
He will be glad to discuss with the 
evening students, on a volunteer 
basis at no obligation to the stu
dent, any vocational, educational, 
or personal problem which may 
confront the student.
