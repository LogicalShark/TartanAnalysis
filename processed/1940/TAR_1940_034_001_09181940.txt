Council Directs Tech 
Student Government
Vo Vl.. 34Nl1CA
Student government at Carnegie 
functions through the Student 
Council, which is the supreme 
governing body of the students. It 
directs student activities, pro
motes closer harmony between the 
student body and the administra
tion and fosters friendly relations 
with, other schools. In many col
leges the Student Council is elect
ed from campus groups making 
rather a selective type of govern
ment. Naturally this type of gov
ernment would be inclined to 
favor minority groups on the cam
pus. Our Student Council, unlike 
this selective type of government, 
is designed to represent every 
student on campus. To do this, 
each of the three schools, Fine 
Arts, Margaret Morrison and En
gineering, is repx*esented in the 
council by voting members elect
ed by the students from the two 
upper classes.. Since Engineering 
has the largest enrollment, ten 
voting members re elected for 
its representation. From each of 
the other colleges five voting 
members are elected. Student 
Council business is of such im
portance that the voting members 
are elected only from the junior 
and senior classes, since they 
should be familiar with campus 
activities. However the sopho
more class is also represented in 
council by three non-voting rep
resentatives. These representa
tives are free at any time to pre
sent the opinions of their class on 
any issue before the council and in 
that way influence the vote of 
council. As an additional incen
tive to democratic government, the 
meetings of the council are at all 
times open to the students. For 
this reason we would like to en
courage lreshmen to attend at
Book Fund 
Is Set Up 
By A. P. O.
Alpha Phi Omega has set up a 
textbook library fund, derived 
from the sale of campus maps last 
year. This fund will be used to 
buy books to be loaned to stu
dents who find it impossible to 
buy or borrow them otherwise.
Any student in such a position 
may address a letter of applica
tion to the Office of the Dean of 
Men. These applications should 
contain a list of the books desired 
and the qualifications of the ap
plicant, i.e. does he pay hi own 
way, does he have a scholarship, 
where does he live, what course 
he is taking, etc.
These applications will be giv
en an impartial and thorough in
vestigation by a small committee 
composed of faculty and student 
members.
Since the fund is small, and 
only a few books can be bought, 
it is desired that students apply 
Jor this service only after exhaust
ing every other means of obtain
ing books.
Students who have books which 
they can. no longer use, but which 
might be used by someone else, 
are asked to contribute them to 
this textbook library. Such books 
may be left at the office of the 
Dean of Men.
least one of the council meetings 
this year.
Student Council for this year is 
composed of twenty voting mem
bers, nine non-voting members 
and the president who conducts 
.the meetings and votes only in 
case of a tie. Perhaps at this 
time it would be advisable to in
troduce the council this year.
President of Student Council 
for the coming year is William W. 
Floyd. Bill is a member of Kap
pa Sigma social fraternity and is 
also a Dragon. Throughout his 
college career he has been ex
ceedingly active in Student Coun
cil and consequently has been a 
member of both the sophomore 
and junior honoraries. The past 
year he was also very active in 
the Mens Christian Association.
Vice President of Council for 
this year is Charles Lange. Chuck 
is a Beta through and through. In 
spite of this he is a good boy. For 
the last three years he has been 
working for Student Council and 
he has finally been elected as an 
officer on council. Chuck is also 
a Dragon this year.

Heads Mentors
Board Set Up Here 
To Replace System 
Of Plebe Advisers
This year freshmen at Carnegie 
will not matriculate under the ad
viser system used here for many 
years, but will be under the coun
cil of a board of forty mentors.
Under the new set-up a sub
committee of seven men headed 
by Dr. William R. Work, head of 
the Department of Electrical En
gineering, will see that the sys
tem is carried out in an orderly 
fashion. Forty members of the 
facultytwenty-six from the En
gineering School and fourteen 
from the Division of General 
Studieswill act as mentors to 
groups of from five to ten fresl]- 
men. ;
Under the new plan the mentor 
has a smaller group with which 
to keep in touch than the adviser 
had previously. Thus more per-' 
sonal contact can be established. 
Also, freshmen in the College of 
Engineering will no longer receive 
monthly reports, but will be grad
ed in the same manner as the up
per classmen. In this way it is 
hoped to eliminate discouragement 
that might fellow the receipt of 
the first months report.
Dr. Work and his committee, 
along with the rest of the faculty 
have spent most of the summer 
coordinating the plans so that the 
system might get oil to a success
ful start.
Members of the committee who 
have worked with Dr. Work this 
Summer include: Dr. Warner, Di. 
Warden, Professor Lawler, Dr. 
Rosenbach and Dr. Miner.

Mrs. Yon Now 
Assistant Dean
Will Combine Duties 
With Those At Union
Due to illness, Dean Mary Wat
son Green will not be able to as
sume her duties during the fall. 
Mrs. Charles Yon has been ap
pointed Assistant to the Dean of 
Students, Dr. Beryl E. Warden, 
to assume Miss Greens duties for 
the present.
As hostess of the Carnegie Un
ion, Mrs. Yon came to Carnegie 
in the fall of 1938. She is a wellknown native of Pittsburgh. As 
Jesse Yuille Yon she was a noted 
professional singer. She was not 
only a charter member, but also 
the first Chaplain of Mu Phi Ep
silon, national honorary for 
women. She also has been active 
in the Tuesday Musical Club.
Mrs. Yon will divide her time 
between the deans office and the 
Union: for the present she will 
act in both capacities.
The Union has been such a 
pleasure, said Mrs. Yon. The 
splendid co-operation of the ad
ministration and the students has 
been wonderful. Im sure it will 
carry over to my new position.

Social Relations 
Receives Library 
Gift From Falk
Some four hundred volumes be
sides periodicals on economics and 
social relations have been donated 
to Carnegie by the Maurice and 
Laura Falk Foundation. Tho 
loundation also provided an en
dowment for tin; new four-year 
program in Social Relations.
At present the collections has 
temporary quarters in the Social 
Relations Seminar room, thus be
coming the nucleus of the Social 
Relations Library. It is hoped 
that an adjacent wing of Indus
tries Building will soon house the 
library gift.
Additions to this collection from 
time to time are being contemplat
ed by the foundations.
Summer Studying, Style Mags 
Are Too Much for Our Nerves
by EI VI
The other afternoon, a bit tired 
of studying for re-exams, we 
turned from Spanish irregular 
verbs to somewhat lighter fiction, 
and read every magazine in the 
house. So now we can tell you 
how youre supposed to dress on 
campus, and if youre not dress
ed like that at the present read
ing, youd better go home and get 
yourself some new clothesor 
give up the idea of a college edu
cation. Or get a barrel  who 
knows, you might start a fad.
Men are given the most atten
tion, and space, but theres noth
ing really sensational about their 
clothes. There is, of course, a lot 
of talk about the button-down col
lar-attached shirt, but we dont 
understand it. And every time we 
begin to catch on, the article sud
denly switches to something about 
every college man should have a 
small refrigerator for midnight 
forays. Which conjures up a 
pretty picture of Noble Scobell, 
chock full of small refrigerators 
and geranium pots at every win
dow sill.
Clothesand gadgetsfor wo
men are what really scare us. 
Maybe its because were in Mar
garet Morrison, and are appalled 
by the prospect of hundreds of 
pairs of bare kneesround and 
square, knock, and dimpled(and 
very probably chapped, when the 
Pittsburgh winter sets in)peer
ing coyly out from hundreds of
circular skirts. And the ever-resourceful editors of Vogue have 
dreamed up a horror (we cant 
remember what its calledprob
ably Twosies, or some such) 
which consists of ankle socks, and 
little bands worn somewhere up 
below the knee, leaving the co-ed 
with her bare calf hanging out 
and a somewhat astonished look, 
as il a well-meaning friends had 
tried to tear off a thread and just 
kept pulling.
College girls are also wearing 
they tell usboxing gloves to keep 
their hands warm and fetching lit
tle charm bracelets with an auto
graph pad hanging from them 
for the boys to sign their names 
in. Believe us, if some of us Mag
gie Murphs ever could get the boys 
to sign their names, it wouldnt be 
on a charm bracelet autograph 
pad.
You probably all know about 
the girls at Smiththe clever 
darlings! They started the fad 
of wearing mens clothes instead 
of their ownif Freud were liv
ing were sure he would have a 
lot of fun connecting that with 
the fact that Smith is not coeduca
tionaland you may expect to 
see a lot of coats, shirts, jackets, 
and such around school this year. 
Aside from the fact that most of 
the lassies look a good deal like 
Worry Wart, its not a bad idea, 
and if the years hadnt made Fa
ther a bit paunchy around the 
middle, we might try it our
selves.
Ground School 
To Start Here 
In Few Weeks
Ground school instruction in 
flying, sponsored by the Civil Aer
onautics Authority, will start at 
Carnegie in the next few weeks. 
Plans are still being made and the 
exact date for the opening of the 
school has not been set.
Juniors, Seniors, and graduate 
students who have reached the 
age of nineteen before October 1, 
1940, and who are not more than 
twenty-six years of age are eli
gible for training. Other require
ments are that the prospective 
student be an American citizen 
and that he pledge himself to 
military service.
Two-thirds of the ground school 
instruction will be given on the 
campus. The remainder of the 
course will be given at the Pitts
burgh, Butler Airport, which is 
about twenty-seven miles north 
of Pittsburgh.
Navigation and meteorology will 
be taught in the ground course, 
Monday and Tuesday evenings 
from 5:30 to 8:30 for eight weeks.
Expenses of the course which 
must be paid by the student are: 
nine dollars for insurance, six 
dollars for a physical examina
tion, and twenty-five cents for 
each trip to the airport.
Dr. Jones, director of the Col
lege of Engineering, will be in 
charge of the program and will 
be assisted by O. C. Simpson, tho 
ground school instructor. Inter
ested students may apply at Dr. 
Jones office or at Mr. Simpsons 
office in room 72A, Engineering 
Hall.

Inter-Fraternity Council
Interfratemity Council will 
hold its first meeting on the 26th 
of this month to take final action 
on several projects which have 
been carried over from last year.
Plans for co-operative buying of 
food by all of the fraternities 
have been arranged by the var
ious fraternity stewards, but final 
details have yet to be taken care 
of. The plan, if carried through, 
would afford great savings for the 
fraternities by the purchase of 
food in wholesale lots.
The social season, as usual, will 
feature the lnterfrater|nity In
formal to be held late in No
vember and the Formal which will 
be early in March.
Plans are also being drawn up 
for a rushing booklet which will 
be sent to all incoming freshmen 
next summer. The I. F. C. will 
also send out introductory letters 
as was done this year.
Officers for the coming year 
are: Ralph Martin, Beta Theta Pi, 
President; Riley Fowler, PiKA,
Vice President; James Damall, D. 
U., Secretary; Frank Helsch, Phi 
Kappa, Treasurer, and Dick Webb, 
A. T. O., Social Chairman.market is glutted.
Skibo, like the map of Europe, 
is in a constant state of flux. Now 
its white, with orange awnings 
at each window. Inside, the ta
bles have been painted, and the 
juke box hidden somewhere where 
we havent yet been able to find 
it. The bridge players, however, 
are still the same  same worn 
cards, same business-like flick as a 
trick is deftly gathered up to join 
its ancestors, same recriminations.
Inside Skibo, too, is a tin box 
with a coin slot in it and a sign, 
Help send Louie to Notre Dame. 
Louie, as you may or may not 
know, is the football team mascot, 
and the coach, or the AA, or who
ever the higher-ups in this case 
are, refuse to pay Louies way to 
Notre Dame. Hence the cam
paign. Any small boy who can 
twirl a baton the way Louie can 
deserves to go to Notre Dameor 
Pago Pago, if he wants to. And 
anyhow, its good luck for the 
team.
By the time you read this, fra
ternity rushing will be over. The 
last cigarette will have been hand
ed out, the last meal bought, the 
last tale told about the new gameroom. More casualty lists will ap
pear in next weeks Tartan. And 
so, God and the Editor willing, 
will Butterscotch. Until then, 
happy schedule!

Carnegie isnt the only place (to 
point out what is quite obvious) 
where the bedlam that is fall reg
istration is going on. From the 
rockbound coasts of Colby to the 
sun-kissed (at times) shores of 
U. C. L. A., the freshmen come 
trooping in, some wide-eyed, and 
some not so very. Entrance ex
ams, technical tests, college 
boards, regents, whatever you like, 
are over; the long, lone nights of 
work, the lost football games and 
battered romances are yet to come; 
right now the plebes main con
cern is how do you get to the reg
istrars office.
Finished, too, are re-exams, those 
mental hangovers from a summer 
spent in glorious procrastination. 
They started last weekthe cam
pus, dead since summer school 
closed, became alive with little 
groups of worriers, holding each 
others head. Painters were chas
ed out of rooms so that the Eng
lish department and its prodigals 
could take over. Those English 
re-exams were important, too. On 
them depend so muchmost of 
the flunkers have been academ
ically dangling all summer, like a 
participle.
We are struck by the fury of 
remodeling that has gone on over 
the summer. The Grill, always a 
surprise, had it's booths shoved 
around again, and is sporting a 
new mural, to take the place of 
Swamp With Cattails. We 
dont know what it is called but 
it seems to trace the deevlopment 
of food, from field and stable to 
the Grill plates. Also, theyre re
arranged the steam table, so that 
the first thing you see is a salad, 
staring you in the face. We cant 
figure out the motivation for this; 
maybe the Jello and marshmallow

cil. Sally has also been active in 
Student Council in preceeding 
years. As a member of both Cwens 
and Mortar Board, she has become 
extremely proficient at selling teadance tickets. As secretary of 
Student Council, Sally will cer
tainly not have much spare time, 
but dont be discouraged, boys.
The envy of every member of 
Student Council, and of the school, 
is James N. McGarvey because he 
is Treasurer of the funds. Jim is 
a Delt and his chosen profession is 
engineering. He has been a mem
ber of both Scimitar and Delta 
Skull and also held the office of 
Assistant Treasurer last year. Nat
urally he has been selected as a 
Dragon for the coming year. If 
you are ever in need of a little 
money come around and see Jim.
Since it is almost impossible to 
introduce every member of Stu
dent Council the remaining officers

Men Named
Students To Work 
Next Semester
Continuing for the third succes
sive year the George Westing
house Scholarship Plan, awards 
have been granted to ten more 
students who have entered Car
negie this year. Chosen from 
a group of 377 applicants all 
over the United States, they 
have worked this last summer at 
various Westinghouse plants and 
at the Research Laboratory. Un
der the terms of the scholarship 
these students will work for three 
additional summers.
Upon completion of the first se
mester of the Junior year they 
will suspend their education to 
work for another year and at the 
end of the years work they will 
resume as second-term Juniors. 
This work-learn policy will make 
it possible for the students to 
have four years of college educa
tion and two years of practical 
experience in five years. Two 
more groups of students will be 
selected so that there will be fifty 
students participating in the plan 
at the end of two years.
During the entire five years re
cipients of the scholarships receive 
fifty dollars a month which may 
be directly applied to tuition if 
the receiver wishes, but it does 
not necessarily have to be used 
for this purpose.
Those who received scholar
ships this year are W. DeWitt

Among the members of a cer
tain chapter of the ancient order 
of Hibernians there was one named 
Pat who was crippled. In spite of 
this handicap, Pat faithfully took 
part in the chapters annual par
ade, hobbling along at the-end of 
the line as best he could. Pres
ently Pat died, and the chapter 
turned out en masse to the fun
eral. In marching to the cemetery 
the order at first formed a column 
eight abreast, but found that this 
left one' man walking by himself 
at the end of the procession. This 
situation was too reminiscent of 
poor Pats infirmity so the line 
was reformed with seven persons 
abreast. Again a single person 
was left at the end. The result 
was still the same when ranks of 
six, five, four, three, and two were 
formed, and the Hibernians were 
finally forced to walk in a single 
file to the burial.

Skibos Open Football 
Season September 28
Team Handicapped
TARTAN STALWARTS
Through Shortage 
Of Able Reserves
By Hal Hartlicb
To most of the students at Tech 
the arrival of cold weather means 
one thingthat football is on its 
way. This happens to be the sit
uation here at Carnegie now, for 
on September 28th the Tartan 
squad will meet the gridiron 
heroes of Geneva at Pitt Stadium.
Lets take a little time out to 
look at the proposed Tartan line
up for this 1940 season. Well start 
with the backfield. On the first 
string we have Tony Laposki at 
full, George Muha and Frank Jordano at halves, and Juice Friedlander at quarter. In this quartet 
the Tartans should undoubtedly 
find the spark which will lead to 
many wins this season, for they 
will form  combination hard to 
beat.
On the first string line holding 
down the end positions we have 
Bob Church and Ted Fisher. 
Church is the boy who waited un
til Spring'training at the end of 
his Freshman year to show his 
stuff. He entered Tech three years 
ago without a scholarship, but his 
football talent proved so promis
ing that he was granted one. Now 
he is a vital gear in tne Tartan 
gridiron machine. Ted Fisher has

torn ligaments in practice last 
week, he will be in there giving 
all he has when the whistle blows 
for the first game, 
in the fight are Bill Sashweight
At the guard position a real 
battle is going on for the positions 
on the first team. The contenders 
Kuenzli, Mike Saska, Red Wind, 
and Bob Domini. Kuenzli will 
probably get the left side of the

Call for Grid 
Prospects
A1 Irwin, in charge of the Fresh
man Football campaign, last week 
announced that all men interested 
in trying out for the Plebe Foot
ball squ^d should report to him 
anytime during the coming week 
at the Carnegie Field House.
A1 Kritscher, whp was appoint
ed Senior Manager of the football 
team, asks all Freshman boys in
terested in the position of Fresh
man Manager to see A1 Irwin in 
the Field House in the next few 
days.
These Carnegie Inter-Collegiate Teams 
Are Open for Student Faticipation
The following sports from a 
complete list of. the athletic ac
tivities in which all students of 
Carnegie Tech may participate.
Football: For the past several 
years Carnegie has held a promi
nent position in the national footweakened by graduation but 
promises to be outstanding. Dr. 
Eddie Baker who has replaced Bill 
Kern as coach has as his assistants 
Joe Skladany and Biff Glassford 
with A1 Irwin as freshman coach.
Basketball: For the past several 
years Tech has had a team that 
has been very prominent in East
ern basketball circles. Although 
several of the mainstays of last 
years team including Rube Stark, 
have been lost by graduation, an 
exceptional plebe team from last 
year will more than make up for 
the graduation losses suffered by 
Coach Max Hannum.
Track: Coach Guy Halferty has 
started the Tech track teams of 
recent years in a climb back to 
prominence in district track cir
cles. During the past three years 
seven records have been bettered 
and four others equaled. Several 
members of the team were lost 
through graduation but the out
look is fairly good.
Cross-Country: Tech has always
been well represented in district 
meets and this year expects to re
gain the Tri-state title. Our three 
mile and six mile courses are 
run through Schenley Park and 
are regarded as the finest in west
ern Pennsylvania.
Swimming: Last year Coach Al
len Risedorph had the best team 
in the history of swimming at 
Carnegie, losing only two meets. 
However nine of the thirteen var
sity men are lost by graduation. 
The outlook for this years team is 
not so bright since there are only 
a few good swimmers from last 
seasons freshmen, Burtis being the 
best prospect.
More next week.

Director of Intramural Board 
Sends Letter to Participants
Intramural Point System
Intramural Board Publishes Revised 
Point System Set Up Last Year
In order to encourage total student participation in intramural 
athletics the board has attempted to provide sports of interest to all; 
and is continuing the expansion of. its program at a rapid rate. So 
that each organization may be credited according to its abilities, the 
following point system has been devised. Each activity receievs a 
certain number of points predetermined by its athletic difficulty and 
the number of students interested.
EVENT POINTS 1 POINTS 8 POINTS 3 POINTS I
Touch Football ............ 50 10 100 200
Basketball ..................... 50 10 100 200
Mushball ....................... 50 10 100 200
Swimming ..................... 35 2 per event 50 100
Table Tennis................. 35 5 50 100
Foul Shooting................ 20 5 25 50
Bowling ......................... 35 5 50 100
1Number of points for entering a team and playing schedule.
2Number of points for each game or match won.
3Number of points for league championship. Half this number 
will be given to runners up.
4Number of points for school championship. Half this number will 
be given to runners up.
If two teams have the same number of points at the end of the 
intramural season, THE TROPHIES SHALL BE AWARDED TO THE 
ORGANIZATION HAVING THE HIGHEST SCHOLASTIC AVER
AGE.
The following is a letter sent out 
by the director of the Intramural 
Board Frank A. Eyman to all po
tential entries in intramural 
events.
The Intramural program on our 
campus for the coming school year 
should surpass that of any previ
ous year in the numbers partici
pating and the satisfaction deriv
ed.
More interest was shown during 
1939-40 than in any previous year. 
The several activities fostered for 
scheduled participation received 
more wholehearted response and 
were more complete in that but 
few organizations had unplayed 
games charged against them.
Our board membership is made 
up of men who have had at least 
two years experience in the intra
mural program, most of them are 
participants in competition. This 
fact shows added strength in the 
governing body.
Rest assured that the Depart
ment will give wholehearted co
operation in bringing about a bet
ter and more interesting pro
gram.

Where?
Dont pass me by with a shrug 
and a lifted eyebrow, folks. Please 
listen to my story. When the-folks 
back home heard that I was go
ing away to college they said, 
Well, Argerella, go down to the 
general store and buy some old 
second-hand white shoes, cut' 
yourself out a Mother Hubbard, 
and boy, will you look like a real 
college girl.
I took this advice, and came to 
Tech with a wardrobe looking as 
if 1 had been going to college all 
my lifeand my clothes looking 
the same. Came registration day 
and I hied myselfall bedecked 
in my bedraggled campus' class
ics (sloppy skirt, outsize sweater 
and hole-y shoes) to the Gym.
wore a matching skull cap with a 
black feather shooting up.
Lots and lots of attractive suits 
were being worn, too. One in par
ticular was a light green tweed 
suit. Flared skirt, bolero-like 
Jacket were set off by a yummy 
yellow sweater. Oh, yes, and a 
calot to match the tweed.
One, brunette freshmen looked 
very self assured in her gray wool 
jumper, gathered at the waist and 
flared in the skirt, which she wore 
with a dark green jersey blouse. 
News about the blouse were the 
bell shaped oleeves and the plain 
round neck. There were a lot of 
jumpers around campus that day. 
Some plaid, some wool, others 
gabardine and even dressy ones in 
silk or velvet.
One of the most interesting 
dresses was a soldier blue gabar
dine shirtwaist. From the openthroat neck-line to the waistline 
marched a row of goldish silverbuttons. (Maybe they were sil
very goldI couldnt decide.) Then 
at the waistline through some jig
gling around of snaps and things 
instead of a single line, continues 
a double row of buttons. On one of 
the small square pockets on the 
top this girl wore a silver eagLe 
proudly spreading its wings.
Dozens of wonderful skirts were 
worn, too. Pleated ones and 
.straight ones, flared and gored, 
plaid, pastel, tweed, wool and jer
sey. I bet lots of them came from
Teaser Answer
If we let capital N represent  
people, it follows that (N-l) must 
be exactly divisible by each of 
the whole numbers from two to 
eight. It must then be some multi
ple of the least common multiple 
of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 which is 840. 
Trial values for N then are 841, 
1,681, 2,521, etc.
The fact that rectangular col
umn of any width could be formed 
exactly requires that capital N be 
a prime number. The first two 
numbers in the series are per
fect squares* but the third is 
prime, that is, exactly divisible by 
no number other than itself and 1. 
There were, then, just 2,521 
mourners at the funeral.
Klynes, on Forbes between Mur
ray and Shady. Theyre having a 
terrific sale of skirts at a terrific 
price, so youll pardon me while I 
get my crew cap and run over 
there.
Flea-bitten
The Scottie Starts 
Scratching Again
Last year the issue was a mite 
confused: did the Plebe flee the 
Scottie, or the Scottie flea the 
Plebe, or both
Mathematician, with several 
space-fillers, went out with the 36 
flood; and the jokes show no signs 
of prudish censors and Scotch re
viewers. Barks and Bites right
ly, however, has more bark than 
bite; Dramania is frivolously 
funny; Prof Profiles are sub
tle as a glib chinchilla-clad whop
per; and Bear Facts are more 
than one can bear.
No, Scottie isnt a dyed-in-theprint howler, but with proper dis
cipline it can be campus-broken 
by next month. Meanwhile leash 
yourself to a Scottie at the near
est post and thrive on the Tar
tans rival dog food.

These are the twin pleasures you look for

you the added pleasure of a cooler smoke... Make your
