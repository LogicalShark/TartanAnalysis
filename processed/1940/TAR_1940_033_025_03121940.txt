Noted Physicist; 
Public Is Invited
Dr. J. W. Beams, professor of 
Physics at the University of Vir
ginia, will speak on High Speed 
Centrifuges at the Mellon In
stitute Auditorium this Friday 
evening at 8:15. This lecture, spon
sored by Sigma Xi, is free to the 
public.
Numerous articles concerning 
phenomena occurring in short in
tervals and the methods by which 
they may be studied have been 
written by Dr. Beams. He is also 
well known for his methods of 
accelerating ions to high velocities 
by moving electric fields.
Beams, famous for his work 
with small centrifuges, has re
cently developed a spinning top 
ultra-centrifuge which makes 
available in a simple apparatus a 
very high centrifugal force. His 
apparatus has even made possible 
the difficult task of determining 
the molecular weights of proteins. 
Centrifugal force equal to 8,-
000.000.times the force of gravity 
can' be made available for sci
entific research. Having no lim
it in its upper speed except for 
the strength of the materials com
posing the rotor, this centrifuge is 
useful in solving important the
oretical problems in molecular 
stability.
Knowledge obtained in this way

By Ruth Brodic
William Shakespeares plays 
have acquired, through the years, 
such a protective covering of 
sanctity that they are almost al
ways accepted rather than ex
amined. Coriolanus, however, 
can be looked at more objectively. 
Because it has been produced so 
seldom, the reviewer may ap
proach it without having to brave 
a Wotans ring of reverential fire.
As a play, per se, Coriolanus 
is an exciting, Often thrjlling work. 
It does not contain the deep char
acter insight of such dramas as 
Lear and Hamlet, but Volumnia and Virgilia are exquisitely, if 
not too subtly, drawn. Of 
Coriolanusat times he is a com
plex', psychologically interesting 
man, while at others he merely 
fits into the broad outlines of any 
proud dictator.
There is a great deal of com
edy in Coriolanus. Valeria is 
the closest thing to a part of Bil
lie Burke that Shakespeare ever 
wrote. The servant scene is com
edy relief in the true sense of the 
term.
Some of Shakespeares most in
volved language, and the many 
mob scenes, make Coriolanus 
difficult to direct. In a few scenes
Costume Ec 
Students Win 
Style Honors
Original designs in feminine 
wear created by the girls of the 
Costume Economics department 
and modelled by them at Kaufrnnnn's Department - Store won' 
prizes last night for six students o 
the department. The prizes 
awarded to each winning student 
at the Style Show consisted of five 
dollars in merchandise.
The following students won hon
ors for their original creations: 
Mary Anna Franklin for a gray 
wool street dress, Maggie Murph; 
Dor the a Mackenroth for Little 
Dipper, a bathing suit, print on 
white background; Jean Kirkwood, 
for Cramming, a pajama cos
tume; Florence Craighead for a 
plaid suit called Big Woman on 
Campus.
Helen Crumpton won her five 
dollars for a dress and coat en
semble called Scotch and Soda, 
as did Frances Taylor for Campus 
Queen, a rayon net taffeta even
ing dress.
Holden Injured, 
Wife Badly Cut 
In Auto Accident
Mr. and Mrs. Charles F. Holden 
are patients at the West Penn 
Hospital as a result of injuries 
they received in an automobile 
accident which occurred at Fifth 
Avenue and Anderson Street on 
Friday morning at about 8 oclock.
Mr. Holden, who is an instructor 
in the Department of Drama, was 
driving, his wife and young 
daughter, Wendy Louise, down
town when the crash took place. 
He received a-hard blow in the 
chest from the steering wheel 
and superficial briuses of the eye 
and lips. Mrs. Holden was badly 
cut.. The exact extent of internal 
injury is as yet unknown. The 
child was unharmed.
Coriolanus Douhlccast; 
Finkcl, Segal Singlecasl
Robert Finkel 40, and Alex Se
gal 40, are the only principal 
characters in Coriolanus who 
are single-cast. They play Brutus 
and Sicinius, respectively, and are 
the leaders of the dissension 
against Coriolanus.
Probably because they are the 
only people familiar to each oth
er in the large cast and double
cast, one never appears on the 
stage without the other. From 
March 9 to March 19 (with mat
inees on the 15th and 16th), Fink
el and Segal will appear, always 
together, always m uttering 
against Coriolanus, the only stable 
features in a changing world.
the direction is a little uneasy, 
and a bit of the action seems un
motivated. The crowds are ex
ceedingly well-handled, but at 
times do not play enough as a 
unit to make the scenes as ef
fective as they might be. The 
majority of the direction, how
ever, is quite successful.
The technical side of the Tech 
production of Coriolanus helps 
the effectiveness of the play a 
great deal. The unit set, done 
three-dimensionally with an inter
esting use of steps and simple 
vertical construction, and beau
tifully lighted, fits the location 
requirements of the play actually 
as well as artistically. Costumes 
contribute a great deal to the 
stage pictures. Sound effects are 
good, but it is the reviewers 
merely personal opinion that 
Beethovens Coriolan overture is 
not quite the entracte music for 
this play, in spite of the similarity 
in name.
It is not quite clear why 
Coriolanus is produced so 
seldom. ^ The play is interesting, 
even stirring. The Department 
of Dramas production, because 
of its general excellence, should 
be seen by lovers of Shakespeare 
as well as lovers of good theater 
in general.

Debaters Meet 
Sliippensburg
Students Invited 
To Hear Discussion
Tonight one of Carnegie Techs 
affirmative varsity teams de
bate the visiting Shippensburg State Teachers College at 
the Carnegie Union at 8 oclock.
Yesterday, Hauser and Beggs 
debated the isolation question be
fore the 12:30 Social Relations 
session in the Theater, College of 
Fine Arts, for the benefit of the 
engineering freshman.
The purpose of the debate was 
to show the freshman the methods 
that can be used to influence the 
publicmethods such as appeal 
to pity, wrath, indignation, and 
other emotions. After the talks 
and rebuttal by the debaters, Prof. 
Leo T. Lawler, of the English De
partment and Carnegie debate 
coach headed a discussion.
Since the social relations class
es are now studying the origin, 
development, and uses of words, 
the program was very timely.

Fellow Wins Honors
One of the four annual Nation

at present is doing graduate work 
in Inorganic Chemistry at the Un
iversity of Illinois.
According to L. F. Audrieth, 
Professor of Inorganic Chemistry 
at the University, Mr. Steinman 
has continued the high standard 
of his scholastic activities and is 
regarded very highly by the de
partment.
Said Professor Audrieth in a 
letter to Dr. L. R. Guild of Tech: 
I am sure that Mi*. Steinman will 
continue to be a credit not only 
to the honorary organization 
which has made it possible for him 
to come to the University of Il
linois for graduate study, but also 
to the Institution where he did his 
undergraduate work.

From President Ihrtierty...
In Mr. Bright's death the Carnegie Institute ol! Tech
nology lias lost one ol: its most devoted and beloved officers. 
An alumnus ol! the institution, Class of 1911, lie has spent most, 
ol! lip, professional life as its Registrar. Our efficient system 
ol! registration, effective and cordial relationships with second
ary schools, and our plan of scholarship administration are all 
monuments of his constructive service. I know of no one who 
was more friendly or who had more friends among all who 
knew him.
From tlie Students, Tartan...
The members of the staff of the Tartan, for themselves and 
the students of Carnegie, transmit their condolences to the 
family and friends of our former Registrar, Alan Bright.
If there is any comfort in knowing that relations between 
Mr. Bright and the students were marked by understanding 
from him and respect from themthat comfort is yours. The 
staff, having had more opportunity than other students to know 
him, is sincere in stating that he was ever helpful and s}rmpathetic. His criticism was always just and direct, and his sugges
tions showed imagination and insight.
That the institution will miss him is evident from the re
sponsibilities he was given, and his successful discharge of them.
Honorary News
Last week in this column, men
tion was made of the newlyiormed Interhonorary Fraternity 
Council. This group has been 
started to carry out a program in
corporating the aims of the var
ious honoraries on the campus 
:and to bring these organizations 
into closer relationship with each 
other.
Although the purposes of the 
Council will undoubtedly expand 
and develop with time, the im
mediate problems on which at
tention is being focused are schol
arship, culture, character, per
sonality, and educational meth
ods.
The importance qf scholarship 
cannot be overemphasized, and 
the honoraries should not only 
recognize it but promote it. Cul
ture, too, is a vital paut of edu
cation as is the development of 
character and personality. Prog
ress- in educational methods is re
lated to the other problems and 
is particularly essential to the 
welfare of the individual student. 
All of these are worthy of a more 
thorough study than they have 
already received, and the Inter
honorary Fraternity Council. In
tends to make such a study.
Tho Council is composed ol! 
thirteen members, one from each 
ol! the following scholastic and 
professional honorary fraternities: 
Phi Kappa Pill, Tau Beta Pi, Pi 
Tan Sigma,  PI Delta Epsilon, 
Scabbard and Blade, Eta Kappa 
Nu, Tau Sigma Delta, Theta Tau, 
Sigma Alpha Iota, Phi Mu Alpha 
of Sinfona, Alpha Chi Alpha, 
and Mortar Board.
Tau Beta Pi Invited
By inviting the members of Tau 
Beta Pi to dinner at the University 
Club on Thursday evening, March 
14, at 6:30, President Robert E. 
Doherty of Carnegie, will be car
rying on a school tradition. The 
former president of Carnegie, Dr. 
Baker, invited members of the 
honorary to an annual tea. Dr. 
Doherty plans to resume this 
practice in part.
Following the dinner there will 
be a discussion of the objects and 
program of the Social Relations 
course.
Phi Mu Alpha Concert
Phi Mu Alpha of Sinfonia, mu
sic honorary for men, will give 
its annual formal concert next 
Sunday evening, March 19, at 
3:15 P. M., in the Exhibition Hall 
of the College of Fine Arts.
Miorlar Board Supper
Mortar Board members were 
hostesses at a very exclusive buf
fet supper held in the Carnegie 
Union last evening. It was called 
a smarty-party because only 
those who ranked highest in their 
studies last semester were asked 
to come.
Approximately five students 
from each class in Margaret Mor
rison and Fine Arts received in
vitations written in verso. At the 
party, each girl, had to identify 
herself as a grind by wearing 
spectacles or something ol! the 
sort.
Jennie Dietzlcr was in charge 
ol the affair.

Westminster 
Defeats Tech 
Quintet, 52-48
Carnegie Techs cagers suffered 
their thirteenth defeat of the sea
son last Thursday at Westminster 
by the score of 52-48.
The Titans started out strong 
to lead at the quarter by a 11-4 
margin, but saw their lead reduc
ed to three points at the half. 
Despite the handicap of poor of
ficiating, the Skibos fought their 
way to the lead at the beginning 
of the last period. From this point 
on the game was a see-saw affair, 
the score being tied no less than 
six times. With only a few min
utes to go Ridl scored a field goal 
and Hetra added two fouls to 
provide the margin of victory for 
the home team.

----By Betty Parker----
It seems that the most im

look forward. Intermixed with 
the business end of the event 
during which time officers will 
bo elected and the proposals and 
discussions for various types ol! 
college athletics will take place, 
will bo a gala week-end of social 
functions including ' a formal 
dance and banquet, sports meets, 
and various other kinds ol! enter
tainment.
Then there is another invita

The evening student seems to 
be a type of human that other 
common folks cannot understand. 
He is constantly faced with a 
task when most people are relax
ing. We are, as a group, just as 
human as other groups; but have 
simply been denied the privilege 
of securing an education in a 
more enjoyable manner, and are 
forced to double up on the work 
required during a days time or 
the privilege will not be ours.
Having been denied a certain 
privilege, is it fitting or right that 
we should be denied or simply ig 
nored in respect to other matters 
The day student has, for a nunv 
ber of years, been able to join var
ious national honorary fratern
ities which exist at Carnegie In
stitute of Technology. The condi
tions required before Being ac
cepted as a member are of course 
varied; but it is our belief that a 
high scholastic standing is the 
first requisite. We believe that a 
certain group of men at night 
school are qualified in every way 
to become members ol sucfi an 
organization. They are pursuing 
degree courses and have scholastic 
standipg that would be envied by 
any ordinary student from' either 
group.
Knowing that certain men in 
night school do possess such re
quisites and would be honored to 
receive such an invitation; the 
next question which arises is in 
regard to the benefits, of such a 
group, to the fraternity itself. It 
is altogether possible that such a 
group of evening students would 
improve and help the fraternities. 
Such a group is actively engaged 
in various positions in industry 
and this enables them to see the 
necessity for new methods of 
thought and to evaluate the edu
cation they arc receiving. The 
viewpoint of the fraternity would 
be broadened and would bo benefittcd in no small degree.
We believe that it is possible 
for the various organizations con
cerned to work out a set of rules 
and regulations which would per
mit deserving night students to 
secure this privilege, and wc be
lieve that both groups would 
benefit, from such a grouping of 
ideals and ideas. What do you 
think? 5d C. T5IiH
Bargain Dance 
By Engineers 
Well A ttended
New Orchestra 
To Make Initial 
Campus Appearance
Only to see the lovely ladies 
smiles, the pretty dresses, the 
amorous glances of the men 
Anyone could tell the occasion, 
the second, called the extra, 
dance of the Engineering Col
lege, held last Saturday evening 
in Thistle Hall.
No one but the Committee and 
the Engineering Officers had the 
slightest idea of what this dance 
might be like, what sort of pro
grams, what decorative theme, 
what type of beautiful corsage, 
and in fact, nothing, but the or
chestra scheduled to play that 
evening had been announced.
But to judge from the large 
turnout, happy faces and the ap
plause the dancers gave Johnny 
Wiles and his orchestra, the longdemanded extra dance of the En
gineers was a real success, a dance 
to uphold the tradition of having 
fine affairs that this college en
joys.
Jo.hnny Wiles came as a new
comer to the Evening Schools 
activities on the campus, and left 
at the close of the evening with 
a reputation established by sev
eral hours music such as has 
scarcely been rivaled by any or
chestra engaged by that group.
The Committee who planned 
the1 dance were confronted with 
the problem of arranging the best 
possible evening on a budget re
cently reduced by Student Coun
cils decision to begin mailing 
the Plaid once more, a problem 
that can be very hard to solve. 
Blue and white helped solve it 
for them, the beauty of these two 
colors blended together in col
ored crepe paper and colored 
light, one can now agree, is hard 
to match.

Because a great number of the 
students failed to receive their

was renewed, they also failed to 
hear of the new pool regulation 
initiated by the school officials.
On Wednesday evening from 7 
to 11 oclock the pool is open to 
the students for mixed swim
ming. On Thursday and Friday 
evenings the pool is open to only 
the male students.
Wednesday evening mixed 
swimming offers a fine oppor
tunity for the members of the 
oposite sex to get acquainted. In 
a school of this type it is always 
hard to provide a common meet
ing place for this purpose, but 
the swimming period offers an 
ideal-place. Of course, it will be 
necessary for you brawny men 
to cover the body beautiful in a 
modest fashion.
Thursday and Friday evening, 
the boys can come out alone if 
they are interested in just swim
ming and swim from 7 to 11 
oclock when regulations say the 
pool must close.

Holds Meeting
Phi Nu Discusses 
Business Control
A Town Hall meeting will be 
held by Phi Nu evening school 
fraternity on March 12th in Car
negie Union to discuss the topic 
Should Government Control 
Business. This should prove an 
interesting and stimulating dis
cussion in view of present gov
ernment activity in such projects 
as T. V. A.
Following the discussion will 
be a quiz and to make things 
more interesting, each member 
will be prepared to give a short 
talk on a personal subject, an ex
perience he has had, or a neverto-be forgotten embarrassing mo
ment.
Phi Nu is a social fraternity 
which began its existence twentyfive years ago as an evening school 
social club. The organization 
went by the name of Klanicht 
until 1921 when it was changed 
to Phi Nu.
The fraternity is open to men 
of all three colleges, and has as 
its purpose the stimulation of in
terest in social activities of the 
evening school. Phi Nus social 
calendar includes monthly meet
ings at Carnegie Union, and 
weekly lunches in downtown 
Pittsburgh. These frequent meet
ings provide opportunity for 
members to get together and dis
cuss various activities of the 
colleges.
The high point of the fraternity 
year is the open dance held in 
Thistle Hall for all members and 
friends.
The Chairman of the Town 
Hall meeting, Otto Ehlers prom
ises a pleasant evening to all who 
attend. Members are urged to be 
present and to bring a friend.
Pen Points
-Ed NussAh! me, two hundred and fifty 
words, the editor says, and here I 
am with a cold in my head and 
nothing else, nothing to write 
about I mean. But if he wants 
words, hell get them even if I 
have to make up the newsnow 
lets see
Of course I could write about 
three-hundred words about the 
swell music played by Clyde 
Knight at the last council dance, 
but, from the size of the crowd, 
most of you must have been there 
so anything about the band would 
be repetition. One thing about 
the dance, and I say it at the risk 
of being called an old-fashioned 
defender of lavendar and old lace, 
but Ill say it anyway. You folks 
who insist on jitterbugging 
make it very hard for the others 
to dance when you get in the 
mood in the center of the floor. 
Since the majority of the people 
are smooth dancers, and the space 
in Thistle Hall is so limited, it 
would make it much easier if you 
would confine your activities to 
the corners of the hall. After all 
the wishes of the majority should; 
be anyones desire.
My gosh, Im almost out of 
words already, and I havent said 
anything about the Fine Arts 
Dance next Saturday, or the fine 
new bands which they have book
ed, but support the dance, youll 
enjoy it.

Easter Vacation 
Will Soon Be Here
There are just eight daysSat
urdays and Sundays included, be
fore Easter vacation beginsand 
all Carnegie Evening Students 
can heave a sigh of relief and 
look forward to a hard-earned rest 
from constant study, and a full 
week-end of pleasures, without 
thought of school until the follow
ing Monday evening, March 25.
Of all the holidays of the year, 
the young ladies must enjoy this 
one most of all, theirs is the privi
lege of dressing in all the finery, 
the brilliant colors of the Easter 
season. Everyones hope is that 
theyll be favored with sunny 
weather for that week-end es
pecially.
The young men, the brutes, will 
probably enjoy buying their girls 
(and those married, their wives) 
Easter eggs and candiesand gen
erously helping to eat the same.
But seriously, all of us sincerely 
look forward to the Easter Serv
ices of the Church, the climax of 
the Lenten Season, the Passion of 
| our Lord, spiritually the most 
beautiful of all the Christian fes
tivals. It is a time when we all, 
even the busiest of us, pause for a 
while and come away mentally 
refreshed.

Student Asks that Honors 
Be Extended to Evening Group
One of the soundest recom
mendations that has come to the 
editors desk in recent months is 
embodied in a letter from Mr. 
John Gore, published elsewhere in 
this issue. Mr. Gore suggests that 
day school honoraries open their 
ranks to evening students. There 
are several points of merit to 
Mr. Gores suggestion, and they 
would benefit both day and even
ing students.
In the limited time since the 
suggestion arrived it has not been 
possible to investigate the num
ber of honararies which could be 
opened to evening students. At 
present, the only one which rec
ognizes evening students, we be
lieve, is Eta Kappa Nu, an elec
trical engineering fraternity. The 
fact that the electrical honorary 
has admitted evening students for 
many years indicates that its 
members are pleased with the ar
rangement.
Exclusiveness, caused by high 
scholastic requirements, adds to 
the desirability of membership. 
No sacrifice need be made, how
ever, since broadening of the field 
of candidates would keep the stu
dent to member ratio at the same 
level.
Members make the organization. 
Most honoraries are made up of
students who take their studies 
seriously. This is all the more 
reason why evening students 
should be admitted. The very 
fact that a man is willing to sac
rifice his leisure time to learn 
more about any given field of 
study indicates the importance of 
the subject to him.
Lets hear from some of the 
other students whose ratings are 
high enough to make them eligi
ble for membership in the honorCorsages that make 
the I. F. mean 
more than just
