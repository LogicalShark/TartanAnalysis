mand a strong, workable, efficient 
staff for next year. The organiza
tion places. the stress on coordi
nation. Taking their cue from past 
experience, analysis of other Car
negie publications, and an inten
sive study of similar magazines 
on other campuses, the Executive 
Board will make the literary 
work, the humor, the art, the lay
out, the advertising, the Scottie 
from cover to cover, a unit. 
Personnel Campaign
Well-directed personnel cam
paigns have brought forth an ex
ceptional array of writers, artists 
and technicians. Photography will 
play an important part in the new

art and the layout, everything will 
show real life. Attractive, inter
esting girl-of-the-month pictures 
will be a regular feature.
Better Advertising
Advertising, designed in coop
eration with the art staff, promises 
new vitality in ad copy.
Next year the Scottie will make 
eight appearances instead of the 
regular six.. The circulation staff 
is putting greater emphasis on 
subscription. Tb the subscribers 
the Scottie will come first and 
cheaper. Each issue will be mailed 
in time to reach the subscriber 
one day ahead of the general 
sale.

Ex-Professor 
Dies At Home
Clifford G. Dunnells, professor 
of civil engineering, emeritus, died 
last Tuesday at his home in Pitts
burgh. Professor Dunnels was 72.
The professor was a member of 
the faculty here until 1943, having 
been appointed assistant profes
sor of mathematics and physics in 
the old School of Applied Indus
tries.
Professor Dunnells was respon
sible for the engineering work on 
some of the largest industrial, fi
nancial and business structures 
of the Pittsburgh district, and al
so had a part in the construction 
of buildings of importance in 
various parts of the country east 
of the Mississippi river.
In 1925 he became vice-presi
dent and director, in charge of 
all engineering for the Pittsburgh 
firm of Hunting, Davis & Dun
nells, with offices in the Centry 
building.
One of the outstanding men in 
engineering education, Professor 
Dunnells in 1912 organized at

When the T\artan next makes 
its appearance on campus it will 
be carnival time. The staff has 
decided to delay publication until 
noon Friday, May 2, so that a 
timely and full account of car
nival doings may be presented to 
the students.
Spring Carnival, Carnegie 
Techs annual three-day celebra

solving the acid atmosphere and 
transposing the forbidding walls 
of the institution are being effect

The success of the decorations, 
however, depends on the coopera

their mid-semester promotions 
following a meeting last week.
Harry Silverman, sophomore 
printer, is now Make-up editor. 
Added to the list of regular col
umnists are Marty Dorff, Bob 
Johnson, Nick Reed, and Viera 
Kulamer. Dorff is featured as drema critic, Johnson and Reed co
pen Sounding Board, and Viera

Delta Gamma and Theta Xi 
Are Winners of Greek Sing
Mrs. C. Schnurer
tetics, institution administration, 
designing clothes, textile testing 
and research, retailing of clothing 
and textiles* and teaching home 
economics.
The day will close with an in
formal tea in the Recreation hall 
on the fourth floor of Margaret 
Morrison.
Over two hundred sorority and 
fraternity members took active 
part in Greek Sing, sponsored last 
Friday evening by Panhellenic 
Council and Interfraternity Coun
cil at Carnegie Music Hall. Delta 
Gamma was judged winner among 
the sororities, Theta Xi for the 
fraternities.
The Delta Gamma team wore 
small shoulder capes with hoods 
attached made from red and blue 
plastic. For their first song they 
sang April Showers with their 
hoods up. Following this, they 
sang Blue Skies and pushed 
their hoods off to symbolize the 
change. Although their voices 
were light, the balance was su
perb.
Kappas Second
Placing second was the team of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma. They sang 
Kappa Kappa Gamma, St. 
Louis Blues, and a medley of 
Whispering, When You Wore 
a Tulip, and Peggy ONeale. 
They had selected pink gowns of 
the shoulderless type and looked 
very lovely.
In the first place from the mens 
group was the Theta Xi team 
which sang Erie Canal, Foggy 
Foggy Dew, and Dry Bones. 
Chuck Tritle was the team man
ager, ably assisted by Tony Zukaskey who wrote an arrange
ment for Foggy Foggy Dew. 
This team of twelve wore white 
shirts, maroon ties, brown trous
ers, and brown shoes.
Second place was won by Delta
Tau Delta singing Little David 
Play on Your Harp, Were You 
There? and Old Black Joe. 
Their choice of music was excel
lent as well as the singing and 
the team made an attractive ap
pearance on the stage.
Judges
The judges for this event were 
Miss Ann George, Miss Mann, and 
Mr. J. Vick OBrien. It was the 
opinion of the judges that this 
was a fine collection of singers 
and the final decision was ex
tremely difficult in view of their 
fine performances. This was also 
claimed to have been one of the 
best sings held here.
The popular songs of today and 
yesterday were of first preference 
among the groups. Clever arrange
ments and hours of diligent prac
tice were responsible for the ext Continued on page 6]

Motley Discusses 
Needs vs. Wants 
At Next Assembly
Arthur H. (Red) Motley, dy
namic lecturer and colorful jour
nalist, will discuss one of his fav
orite themes, Needs vs. Wants, 
next Tuesday at 11:30 in the Lit
tle Theatre.
A preview of the lecture can 
not be had as Mr. Motley has the 
nice habit of speaking extempo
raneously. However, an analysis 
of several previous talks by Mr. 
Motley give an indication of his 
theme. .
Mr. Motley says that needs are 
not important until they are con
verted into wants. It is not needs 
which are the dynamic forces in 
the world but wants, the desire 
to fulfill these needs. 
Technical Aids 
Citcommentator
The Executive Board of the 
Carnegie Technical has granted the 
Citcommentator, bimonthly publi
cation of the Citcom Clan, the use 
of its offices and equipment, in 
response to a request made at the 
last meeting of the Student Con
ference committee.
This new arrangement is one of 
the benefits derived from the work 
of the Student Conference com
mittee. It is indicative of the at
tempts which are being made at 
these meetings of the heads of or
ganizations with President Doher
ty to cooperate for the benefit of 
all. The Carnegie Technical, hav
ing adequate facilities for both it
self and Cano, has extended their 
use further in the spirit of this 
new program of mutual support.
Registration Days 
Are Announced
The last day of classes of the 
current trimester is May 26. En
gineers will register for the sum
mer session on June 2 and 3, 
classes beginning on the fourth. 
The final day of school will be 
September 27, with the com
mencement on Sept. 28.
Registration for the fall semes
ter will be on October 3, 4, 6, and

Editors Armchair v
A favorite topic for bull sessions, second of course to the 
topic of women, is that of what one wishes to get from life and 
from college. We are hardly qualified to answer the former, 
but we do intend to express some opinions on the latter.
We think there are two main things one should get out 
of college: a knowledge of certain studies and an education. 
The latter can be broken down into learning how to think and 
learning how to get along with people. The last is our subject 
this week.
The best way :to acquire a social sense is to work with peo
ple, have fun with them, share experiences with them. We are 
of the opinion that engaging in school activities is one of the 
best ways to accomplish that. One can learn a great deal about 
getting along with others by working with them, on a publica
tion for example, taking orders and giving them, and going 
down to the Greeks afterwards.
Educational Balance
However, to achieve a proper balance between studies and 
activities is not easy. We havent achieved the right balance 
in six semesters. In due deference to our President, we must 
admit that studies have considerable importance, but we can
not admit that they are all-important. In proof of this, we cite 
a statement made in an interview by Mr. Charles Wangeman, 
head of our Bureau of Placements, to the effect that 85% of 
C1T graduates from the College of Engineering were hired on 
personal qualifications rather than on technical skill.
There are two good reasons for participating in extra-currieular activities: for the human broadening mentioned above and 
just for the fun and enjoyment to be derived from such work.
Our campus has a few men weighted down with key-chains, 
who are looked upon with awe and with a certain amount of 
humor. But I believe one thing is true of all these mighty keychains: they seem like good people to get along with.
Now as to the activities in which one can engage, there are 
two principal groups: those you go out for, and those you are 
selected for. Generally to be selected for the second group, you 
must have a number of activities in the first group.
A Complete Selection
In the first group are nine publications: Tartan, Technical, 
Thistle, Scottie, Tri-pubs, and Cano which are all-school, and 
Form for Fine Arts students, the Bagpiper for dorm students, 
and the Citcommentator for independent commuters. Then there 
is WCIT, the Film Arts club, IRC, Kiltie Band, Glee clubs, Or
chestra, Chapel Choir, Scotch and Soda, Citcom, Y-Cabinet and 
CWCA, and a number of other religious groups, Spring Car
nival committee, cheerleading, and various athletics. Which of 
this large number a student wishes to engage in depends on 
his interests.
We realize that this is a rather poor time of year to make 
a plea for activities, since it is so near to the end of the school 
year, and also because most of ones spare time is spent either 
at the Greeks or in Schenley Park. This editorial is addressed 
chiefly to those who will be back next fall, in order to tell them 
of some of the activities for which they are eligible, and to 
point out some of the advantages connected therewith.
We are glad to be able to report that after all the bitterness 
of the negotiations both Scotch and Soda club and the Spring 
Carnival committee had very successful ticket sales.
For the Cause
We hope that all of you contributed to the Steffen Memorial 
Scholarship Fund. It is definitely a worthwhile cause. How can 
you expect the fellows on the football team to give their all 
for the school, if the students of the school refuse to support 
the team? Remember that playing football is not all glory. 
Instead, it is practically all hard work in very large amounts.
R. C. Eschenbach.

Troubles Haunt 
Russian Graduate
A Carnegie Tech metallurgy 
graduate got himself into hot wa
ter this week as he tried to 
straighten out a new wives tale.
Vasily Vasilevitch Kunznetsov 
(Met. 33), Soviet Chief Commis
sion of Labor Unions and next in 
line for the succession to the Vice 
Presidency of Soviet Russia, was 
besieged by British petitioners 
and reporters at the London air
port several days ago. As head of 
the twenty man Soviet good will 
mission to Britain Mr. Kuznetsov 
was asked to please remember 
our fifteen wives. This, by fif
teen British soldiers recently re 
turned from Russia who cannot 
be reunited with their young Rus
sian brides because of a Soviet 
edict forbidding marriage between 
Russians and aliens.
Old Tech grad KJuznetsov was 
bewildered. The great interest 
that is being shown by the British 
press rather surprises us, he said. 
It is clear, wrote a British news
paper, that good-willer Kuz
netsov thought it a trivial matter. 
He could hardly be more mis
taken.
Kuznetsov made many friends 
and contacts while he studied at

On Stage
By Marty Dorff
I have seen Coronados Chil
dren twice and confess that I am 
baffled. For the life of me I can
not understand what possesses the 
drama department to produce this 
play.
In the first place, the plot has 
about as much inspiration and 
wallop as the lead story in Thrill
ing Westerns. To be sure the 
gross injustice done to the In
dians by the white man is drag
ged in, but that ceased to be a 
burning question decades ago; 
even PM couldnt get itself work
ed up about that.
The characters are routine stock 
with a few exceptions; there is 
the practical American, his nag
ging wife, the nymphomaniac sec
retary, the servile half-breed, the 
educated but sinister native, and 
the betrayed native girl. The bur
ro, even with her somewhat lim
ited vocabulary, is far more inter
esting than any of them.
The play opens with the silliest 
piece of business I have ever seen 
on CITs stage. It is the sort of 
thing that kids perform at sum
mer camps, replete with comic 
opera Spaniards and cigar-store 
Indians. The Indian slaves do not 
help the illusion any with their 
comical groans. Even the beautifully-done dance by George Corrin and Alfred Lehman cannot 
save this laughable scene, the onStudent Council...

'
ly possible justification for which 
is that it makes the epilogue un
derstandable. This scene should be 
cut out and destroyed before too 
many people get to see it.
The remaining scenes are mucb 
better, it is true. There are times 
when the endless explanations 
end, the harangues halt, an$ the 
play comes to life. The burial of 
the burro, for example, is strange
ly moving. The scene that ends 
with the baying of the coyotes is 
really spine-chilling, and Mozos 
speech at the end of Act I is 
forceful and graphic. The scenes 
between the prospector and the 
preacher are consistently good; 
these two, together with the cam
era addict, who is a broad satire 
on the camera fiends running 
loose in our midst, are by far 
the most interesting and original 
characters in the play.
The piece ends with a scene of 
boisterous hilarity, which is real
ly quite funny. It certainly serves 
the purpose of sending the audi
ence home in a good frame, of 
mind, perhaps even thinking they 
have seen a very clever and Vritty 
thing. But after all, the play is an 
ironic satire, and it hardly seems 
reasonable to end it with a bur
lesque which has nothing to do 
with the action of the play.:
The actors do about as well as 
they can under the circumstances.

TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
The Passing Parade
By Carl Klahr
With all the energy and earn
estness of a Don Quixote attack
ing the windmills, Honest Henry 
Wallace is ruffling the calm of 
many a politicians mind. At the 
moment Henry, who has no 
Sancfeo Panza for a squire, is get
ting the worst of it. In fact, there 
is now such a frenzy of namecalling for Mr. Wallaces benefit 
as no past vice-president since 
Schuyler Colfax has called down 
on himself.
Henry is not new to the game. 
He is adventurous and uninhibited 
where politics is concerned. Who 
else would become so worked up 
at being photographed with his 
face^covered with shaving lather, 
that ^he would floor the photogra
pher with a lusty wallop? And 
who else, pray tell, in the midst 
of a distinguished career, would 
remain po true to his first love 
agriculturethat on journeys to 
foreign parts he must take with 
him>- ten dozen eggs for poultry 
research.
But despite these accentricities, 
Mr. Wallace is far from being 
either a fool or a Moscow puppet, 
as his newspaper owning enemies 
claini him to be. He is not a sim
ple .farm boy; he is a liberalthinking individualist who quit 
polities to be free to spout oil 
whenever his blood boils, a fact 
which alone should give him a 
hearing before the public. Instead 
it is the. fashion to laugh him off, 
to call him a simpleton, a copper
head, a traitor.
What is the extent of Mr. Wal
laces heresy?
At present we are confronted 
with a double-dealing aggressive 
oligarchy, the Soviet Union. Rus
sian agents are operating in many 
European countries, and it is no 
secret that Stalin is supporting 
the spead of Communism. How
ever, it is not clear to us whether 
Russia intends eventually to 
spread the gospel of Communism 
by force of arms; or whether the 
present swashbuckling, swordrattling talk is only a device to 
scare the Russian people into be
ing contented with their terribly 
skimpy lot.
Noi- is it clear to us what reac
tion 'American support of Greece 
and Turkey will have on the Rus
sian leaders. Will they say Well, 
we cant bluff the U. S., weve got 
to quit this finagling? Or will 
they, who have been educated to 
the menace of capitalist imper
ialism all their lives, become 
convinced that America seeks to 
destroy Russia? This doubt about 
the Soviet purposes and Soviet 
psychology is the real question 
before any American who primar
ily wants peace. And we know 
very little about Russian psy
chology.
President Truman, in his now 
famous doctrine, which Con
gress will soon approve, thinks the 
Russians will follow the first 
course of action; that is, they will 
realijpe they cant bluff us, and 
will bow themselves out of the 
game.
But Henry Wallace thinks that 
the reason Russia is playing the 
bully is that in comparison to the 
U. S., it is a weakling; that there
fore its leaders feel they must 
bluff and bluster and scare their 
people into working; that Russia, 
once it has become a productive 
nation, will drop its aggressive
Womens Guild 
Elects Officers
The elections for officers of 
Womens Guild were held on Wed
nesday, April 16. President of the 
organization is Barbara Irwin 
from belta Gamma.
First vice-president is Phyliss 
Grant from AEPhi; second vicepresident, Dee Moore of Delta 
Delta Delta; and third vice-presi

ization is Betty Miller, and Shirley 
SassanO was elected treasurer.
attitude. Furthermore, he thinks 
that a strong stand on our part 
will frighten the Russians even 
more, frighten them into thinking 
war with us is inevitable.
So this question is not basically 
what our oversimplifying news
papers call it: Shall we believe 
the Soviet Government is good 
and kind or shall we back up 
Greece? If that were it, Henry 
Wallace would be indeed a sim
pleton. But the real question is 
this: What are Russias real pur
poses, and how will our actions 
affect them?
Our problem is that we lack 
this factual information. You can 
only speculate, I can only specu
late. If President Truman bets 
one way, though all the kings 
men go with him, we should not 
call Wallace a fool merely because 
he places his bet on the other 
horse.
In the absence of straightfor
ward facts, it nevertheless seems 
to me that a firm policy with 
Russia is most effective, and that 
the Russian leaders are too sane 
to be frightened into war merely 
because we show them that we 
can play at their game too. I am 
not so convinced of this, however, 
that I would call Henry Wallace, 
who does not share my point of 
view, a fool and a traitor. But 
Wallace has shot off his mouth 
this time in the midst of an antired hysteria, and he now reaps 
the whirlwind. Poor Henry!

There is an old adage that good 
things come in the same package. 
During the history of the threatre 
certain families have helped to 
make theatrical history. The Bar
rymores, the Lunts, the Garson 
Kanins, the Rover Boys. So with
in Forbes hall there are three 
roommates who contribute a lot 
of talent to the soon-to-be-seen 
Rock n Riot.
These are the three drama stu
dents: Ruth Pivirotto, Phillis Petrikin, and Renee Orkin. Piv was 
last seen as Essie in You Cant 
Take It With You and is dance di
rector for the Scotch and Soda 
show. She is a model for Hornes, 
Kaufmanns, and Gimbels and 
was a ballerina for the Pittsburgh 
Civic Opera company last sum
mer.
Phil Petrikin is very popular 
around campus, having been This
tle Queen, a prospective Campus 
Queen for this years Spring Car
nival, and active on Student Coun
cil and Dorm Council. She has 
played mainly comedy roles dur
ing her two years at Western 
College before coming here. At 
CIT she has been seen in You 
Cant Take It With You, Time o/ 
Your Life, and as a singer in Trial 
by Jury last year. If youve miss
ed all these productions she will 
appear next week in Rock n 
Riot.
The third member of this triad 
is Renee Orkin. Renee was last 
seen in King Lear as the charm
ing Cordelia, and in College Wid
ow as the inimitable Flora. Renee 
was at the Cain Park theatre for 
the summer months, doing such 
shows as Of Thee I Sing and Weep 
No More, My Lady. Renee is an
other songstress who will be 
heard in the Scotch and Soda 
show.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1947
The Sounding Board ROTC Group
Nick Reed and Bob Johnson
Who was this man Wally Stef
an?
And why Steffen Memorial 
cholarships?
These questions had been puzling us for a long time, as we imlgine they have most of you. So 
'$ did what we could to dig out 
he story of Wally Steffen and 
vhat he meant and still means to 
arnegie Tech.
The conclusion we came to was 
that whatever glory Carnegie 
Tech ever achieved on the grid
iron can be attributed in a great 
measure to the personality and 
the coaching genius of Walter P. 
Steffen. Not only was he one of 
the greatest football players and 
coaches ever produced by this na
tion, but he was in addition an 
outstanding judge and man of 
public affairs.
For the benefit of those who, 
like ourselves until recently, may 
tlot know the story of Wally Stef
fen and his contribution to Car
negie Tech football glory, we will 
herewith present a brief outline 
of his, to say the least, spectacular 
?areer.
Starred In College
His collegiate football career 
3gan in 1905 at the University 
. Chicago, where, as a freshman, 
3 regularly embarrassed the varty by running through it for 
,ouchdown after touchdown in 
practice. During the next three 
years he gave Mid-Western foot
ball fans thrill after thrill as be 
nade for himself a place in Chi
cago football history second only 
to the great Walter Eckersall.
He rounded out his collegiate 
career in 1908 as captain of his 
team, All-American quarterback, 
and the obvious inspiration for 
his mates^as they walked off with 
;he Western championship. These 
vere only a few of the honors 
hat fell to him during his underraduate days, for his fellow stuents had early learned of his 
many talents, and the yearbook of 
his class well illustrates the sta
ture he had already gained.
Comes To Tech 
Graduating from law school in 
912, he wasted little time in enering public life. In 1914, the 
ear he began his long tenure as 
joach here, he was also elected as 
ilderman in Chicago. Slowly but 
arely he built Techs football 
fortunes, getting more and more 
alumni support all the while. But 
it was his ability to attract worth
while candidates, and once hav
ing attracted them, to mould them 
into great players that was the 
;eynoting factor of Techs rise to 
iotball eminence.
While he improved the calibre 
ball played by our teams, the 
hedule began to show more and 
ore big-time opponents. Through 
s personal friendship with 
nute Rockne, Notre Dame apeared on the schedule. This se
es reached its climax in 1926 
hen an underdog Tech eleven 
hipped the highly touted Irish

9-0 while Rockne was off watch
ing Army and Navy. This was one 
of the greatest upsets of that or 
any other season. The victory was 
repeated in 1928 to the tune of 
27-7, with Howard Harpster, the 
greatest star he developed here, 
spearheading the attack. 
Commuting Coach
In 1922 he had been elected 
a Judge of the Superior Court of 
Cook County (Chicago), a post he 
held continuously until his death, 
through Republican and Demo
cratic administrations alike. From 
then until he relinquished the 
football reins here in 1932 he 
regularly commuted between Chi
cago and Pittsburgh each week
end during the football season. 
After spending every Friday, Sat
urday, and Sunday here with his 
team he would return to Chicago 
to preside over his court for an
other week. So much did he enjoy 
working with his boys that each 
year he voluntarily worked 
through the heat of summer in 
court to make up for the time he 
took off each fall.
Not only was he a respected 
jurist and a great coach, but he 
was also the type of man who 
left friends wherever he went. 
Buddy Overend, who knew him 
well through long association says 
of him, Of all the coaches and 
men in athletics Ive ever met 
there has never been another like 
Wally, and I dont believe there 
ever will be. Harry Keck, sports 
editor of the Sun-Telegraph, who 
has been observing the Pittsburgh 
sports scene for many years avers 
that, Nothing too nice can be 
said about Wally.
Beloved By All
With his players also he was a 
great favorite. Woe to anyone 
who wanted to do business with 
the Judge in Pittsburgh after he 
had been cornered by a few mem
bers of his team for the inevit
able bull-session. He was then to 
be considered busy for the re
mainder of that day. Time meant 
nothing to him when there were 
interesting people to talk to. His 
friends tell of how Wally often 
kept important dinner guests 
waiting for hours while he dis
cussed the affairs of the world 
with a plumber or truck driver 
he had chanced to meet on his 
way. Our politicians of today 
might well learn what a true 
democrat is by observing his ex
ample.
But Wally Steffen now lives on 
with us only in memory. He died 
just ten years ago, after an illness 
of several years had forced him 
to give up the active life he loved. 
He is today but a legend at Tech 
an eternal legend of a great 
man who founded a tradition of

sacrifice, and of character devel
opment through active competi
tion which stands as a challenge 
to every one of us who passes 
through the portals of this school.
Today we do not have, nor is it 
likely that we shall ever again 
have a Wally Steffen who, through 
the force of his personality and 
his coaching genius could set us 
on the road to football glory, but 
we do have the inspiration of the 
example he set.
Its Up To Us
If there exists in any of us a 
desire to produce athletic teams 
of which we may justly be proud 
we must realize that a large part 
of the responsibility for achieving 
this goal now must lie with us 
with the energy, the initiation, 
and the intelligence which we di
rect toward reaching this goal. 
Can we all, working together, 
achieve in some part, what Wally 
Steffen almost single-handedly 
once did? We would like to think 
so.

One of the girls this week is 
Maggie Harris, who has been in 
enough activities around campus 
for at least three of the girls. She 
hails from Braddock Heights, 
Maryland, her hair is light brown, 
her eyes are blue, and  well,
you see her picture. A general 
science senior, she is majoring 
in chemistry.
She has served as freshman 
house president, president of 
Cwens, sophomore womens hon
orary, member of Pan-Hellenic 
council for two years, and mem
ber of womens dormitory coun
cil. At present she is president of 
Mortar Board, senior womens 
honorary, and rushing chairman 
for Kappa Alpha Theta, her sor
ority.
As evidence of her popularity 
on campus Maggie was elected to 
the. Spring Carnival Court both 
last year and this year. She in
dulges in slightly less regal ac
tivities also, for last year she 
danced in the Scotch and Soda 
chorus line, and during her fresh
man year she played basketball. 
A loyal resident of Whitfield hall, 
she firmly maintains its superi
ority over its rivals.
Maggies chief interests are 
swimming and people in general. 
She was hard pressed to think of 
a single dislike, but when pushed 
she admitted a strong aversion to 
hominy grits and fish. It also 
came out that she has a passion 
for string beans, so much so that
she eats them for breakfast. In 
the world of the arts she leans 
toward musical comedy, boogiewoogie, and Chopin.
Among the people in general 
that form one of her chief inter
ests, there is one in particular. 
Thats Tom Farrahy, president of 
Delta Tau Delta, to whom Maggie 
has been pinned for a year. Toms 
principal vice, according to Mag
gie, is that he is a somewhat re
luctant dancer; it appears that 
hes good for only four or five a 
night.
After graduation this spring "she 
hopes to work in a chemistry lab
oratory, doing anything but wash
ing test tubes and bottles. Her 
further plans are indefinite ex
cept in one respect: she doesnt 
want to live in Pittsburgh. How
ever, she confesses she will be 
sorry to leave here because of her 
many friends on campus.

Cindermen Drop Opener 
Beaten By Case and W. Va.
The Carnegie Track Team opened the season very inauspicously 
last Saturday as they finished third in a meet with West Virginia 
and Case at Cleveland. The final score found Tech with 36 points while 
West Virginia had 57% to trail the Cleveland Scientists, by only 1 
point.
An early rain had left the track in poor condition and the boys 
spent most of the afternoon skirting puddles and pulling themselves
out of mud baths. Because of the

Now that the thermometer as 
well as the calendar says that 
spring has arrived, the tennis 
courts and golf links are once 
again being trod by the wearers 
of the plaid. With the first sched
uled meets less than a week away 
the boys are hustling into final 
form.
Mr. Moses refuses to make any 
predictions, but by the looks of 
the number of letter men return
ing, the tennis team should be 
more than competent. Among 
those who won Cs in the past 
few years and will be back to the 
wars this year are Sellke, Heck
man, Arrott, Schoenberger, and 
Edgecomb. All told there are 
21 men out for the squad and with 
the new men keeping the experi
enced nucleus hustling, we can 
look forward to quite a few victor
ies.

There Was A Day
Back in 1928, when Carnegie 
Techs football team won seven 
games while losing only one. That 
year the team lost only to New 
York University, and that in the 
last game of the season, while 
winning over such teams as Notre 
Dame, Washington & Jefferson, 
and Georgetown. The record for 
the 1928 season was:
Carnegie Tech 32|Westminster 0
Carnegie Tech 65| Ashland 0
Carnegie Tech 39| Thiel  13 
Carnegie Tech 19|W & J 0
Carnegie Tech 61 Pitt 0
Carnegie Tech 13| Georgetown 0
Carnegie Tech 27|Notre Dame 7
Carnegie Tech 13|New York U. 27
Season Highlites:
Howard Harpster was captain 
and quarterback of the team. At 
the end of the season he was se
lected as quarterback on the All 
American Team chosen by Cad 
Jones, Knute Rockne, and Pop 
Warner.'
Coach Wally Steffen unleased a 
bag of trick plays for the Notre 
Dame game and his eleven won 
a great viptory over the Irish. The 
Steffen system of football was now 
nationally known and the names 
of Steffen and Carnegie Tech were 
both tops in the sports world.
Ken Strong managed to bring 
about the Tartans defeat in the 
N. Y. U. game. Ken and his edu
cated toe seemed to be the Skibo

for all events were far below 
normal and no meet records were 
close to falling.
Warren Ware and John Riehl 
were the big guns for the Tartans 
as they took first place in the pole 
vault and high jump respectively. 
And those were the only firsts thaj 
we took for the whole afternoon. 
The team could place no better 
than second in any of the track 
events. Ware also finished second 
in the shot put, with Beamer sec

In Softball Competition
Four teams pounded the old ball around good enough to wii 
their first two games of the season and top positions in the Intramura 
Softball Leagues. The Delts and Kappa Sigs have already reduced the 
Federal League to a two team race while in the National I^eague 
the Sigma Nus and D.U.s are currently in control.
The best game in the Federal League went to the I^elts last w 
when they beat the Dorm Combine 6-3. Both teams had won th 
openers with little trouble. The Delts belted the Emanons off 
cut 14 to 6 while the Combine outslugged the Phi Kaps 11-6. Hov. 
ever, the Combine must have left their bats at the Dorm the way 
they batted against the Delts. In seven innings they managed to get 
o'he single and one safe bunt from Kep Pratt.
The Delts took an early lead on homers by Morinello, Weber, 
and Haller, and were able to hit at will throughout the game. The 
only serious Combine threat came
in the sixth when they bunched 
four straight walks with a single 
for two runs.
Another tight game that was 
played to the last out was the Phi 
KapsKappa Sig tussle last Fri
day. The Kappa Sigs jumped off 
to a four run lead with two runs 
in the second and two in the third 
but the Phi Kaps came right 
back to get one in the third, and 
two in the fourth, on a homer by 
pitcher Cantini, and one in the 
fifth. With the game tied and two 
men out in the sixth inning, the 
Kappa Sigs combined a hit with 
an error to squeeze the winning 
tally across and win the game 5- 
4. Earlier in the week the Kap
pa Sigs took a slugging victory 
from the Splits 14-7 and now hold 
a record of two wins and no 
losses.
The Star of Sigma Nu was shin
ing bright and strong after their 
first two games in the potent Na
tional League. In their openingday game with A.T.O.s the Sigma 
Nus left little doubt of their 
strength as they turned in the 
only shutout of the season 9-9, 
behind the two hit pitching of 
Ralph Reich. In the fifth inning 
the Sigma Nus took advantage of 
four errors on the part of the 
A.T.O.s to push across four runs 
on one hit and then in the top 
half of the seventh scored five 
more runs on three hits and three 
more erros.
Not satisfied with winning their 
first game by scoring nine runs 
the Sigma Nus teed off on th 
winless A.S.C.E. for eleven h* 
and sixteen runs to win a snr 
game 16-4. The majority of th*. 
scoring for Sigma Nu was bunch
ed into three big innings. After 
scoring one in the first they added 
six in the third, five in the fourth, 
and four in the seventh.

ig construction, the first of its 
ype to be founded by any Ameran institution of higher learning, 
a 1929 it graduated the largest 
lass of any department in the intitute. Mr. Dunnells was named 
in associate professor and head 
j the new department at the time 
"^its founding, and in 1918 was 
-fle a full professor. He became 
h-fessor of civil engineering in 
yj} when that department ab<*oed building construction subcts at Carnegie.
A Pittsburgh historical work re
ports that thousands of students 
benefited by Professor Dunnells 
work, the influence of which has 
been felt in the building industry 
throughout the entire country. 
Born in Glenfield 
Mr. Dunnells was born at Gleniield, Allegheny county, in 1875, 
the son of Clifford Charles and 
Susan Emma (Christy) Dunnells. 
His father was a successful church 
furniture manufacturer in the 
Northside district of Pittsburgh.
Professor Dunnells attended 
Pittsburgh public schools and in 
1893 was graduated from the old 
Central High School. The follow
ing year he spent as a student 
at the Western University of 
Pennsylvania (now the University 
>f Pittsburgh).
Entering Lehigh University in 
94, he went on to obtain a deee in civil engineering there in 
.97. Following graduation he 
joined the Pittsburgh Bridge com
pany as a civil engineer, and when 
that firm was taken over by the 
American Bridge company, he re
mained to become assistant de
signing engineer. Resigning in 
1910, he joined the faculty at 
Carnegie Tech and at the same 
time became consulting engineer 
to- several architectural concerns 
in Pittsburgh.
Registered Civil Engineer
Professor Dunnells was a Reg
istered Civil Engineer, a past pres
ident, Pittsburgh Section, Amerian Society of Civil Engineers and 
i director for three years of the 
national body of that society. He 
was also a member of the Engi
neers Society of Western Pennsyl
vania; the American Concrete In
stitute; and Phi Kappa Phi, schoastic honorary.
He was active in civic and fra
ternal groups as a member of the 
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, 
the Highland Country Club, and 
the Lehigh chapter of Delta Upsilon fraternity. Prominent in Ma
sonic affairs, he was a Past Mas
ter of McKinley Lodge, No. 318, 
F. & A. M.; a Past High Priest of 
Shiloh Chapter, No. 257, Royal 
Arch Masons; and a member of 
Pennsylvania Consistory, Ancient 
Accepted Scottish Rite, and oi 
>yria Temple, A.A.O.N.M.S.
6 _______________________________
On Stage
[Continued from page 2]
William Clark plays the camera 
fan with deftness and restraint; 
he has one of the surest comic 
touches in the drama department. 
William Ross as the preacher and 
Robert Parks as the prospector 
are both outstandingly successful 
in rewarding roles. Louis Knaaks 
portrayal of the cringing guide is 
excellent, both in accent and de
meanor. Joyce Kingston and Nan
cy Marchand are good as Sue Rea
gan; they make her nature just 
femininely inconsistent instead of 
downright intolerable, which is 
quite a job. Rhoda Reig and James 
Harkey grossly overplay their 
roles by mugging, gesturing, and 
brandishing their lines around 
like clubs.
The scenery for the play is 
opulent and deserving of special 
commendation. The sunset scene 
in the canyon is one of the most 
beautiful I can remember seeing, 
and the desert scene catches the 
effect of endless space and blue 
sky remarkably well.
Apparently the play is meant to 
be a satire, but no one would 
guess that by seeing it. Outside 
of a few humorous remarks and 
some not-so-humorous ones the 
production is a pretty serious af
fair, and there is nothing so ridi
culous as a satire that misses fire. 
I believe the whole play would 
be much better for being cormpletely rewritten and played for 
the laughs.
Greek Sing
[Continued from page 1] 
cellent results achieved. The 
proper combination of harmony 
and dynamics changed many plain 
tunes into beautiful songs. Songs 
such as Little David Play on 
Your Harp by the Delta Tau 
Deltas, The Cossacks by the 
Kappa Sigs, and the Tech version 
of the Stein Song by the D.U.s 
added to the quality of the music 
presented.
Novelty tunes and arrangements 
also added considerably to the in
terest in the program. The Beta 
Sigma Rho team gave a very 
heart-rending version of Sa
loon. This was followed by a 
little light drama and So Long, 
Mary, with the boys wearing lit
tle hats to help put over the tune. 
This received recognition from the 
audience. The Spike Jones version 
of their Sweetheart Song by the 
Tau Delta Phi team was really 
quite an arrangement. Whistles, 
bells, guns, bursting balloons, and 
a murder, all combined with a 
fast tempo, really made a hit 
with the audience.
Teams Dressed Variously
The teams were dressed in var
ious styles. Among the girls, the 
variations were mainly color and 
style of gowns. From the chic 
white of the Chi Omegas with or
chids at the waist to the pastels 
and bustles of the Delta Delta 
Deltas and a design in black and 
white by Alpha Epsilon Phi, the 
girls were striving for perfection
in appearance as well as ability. 
Among the men. the trend was 
generally tuxes. The director of 
the Kappa Sigs wore tails and 
white gloves. The Sigma Nu team 
wore summer formals. All in all, 
the singers were very attractive 
in appearance.
Each team performed In a very 
precise manner during their allot
ted ten minutes and the program 
was concluded slightly ahead of 
schedule.

Tech. He was very much liked 
here. Because of his many for
eign contacts the Russians regard 
him as very cosmopolitan, and two 
years ago sent him on a good will

As a result of Mr. Kuznetsovs 
experiences, Metallurgy depart

Council Plans 
Swim Party
The next social event will start 
off with a big splash. Yes, its go
ing to be free. And, there is no 
catch to it either. The time will 
be Saturday evening, May 10 at 
the Tech swimming pool in the 
Gymnasium building, from 8:30 
till 10:30 p. m. Afterward theres 
refreshments and dancing at the 
Carnegie Union from 10:30 to 
12:00.
This will be a good time for all 
of you men to see how your best 
gal looks in a bathing suit. Also, 
it will give all of you gals an op
portunity to strut before the male 
members of the student body. 
Only your registration card will 
be necessary for admittance and 
you are welcome to bring a guest.
If there is a good turnout for 
this party, you can plan on hav
ing more and better free affairs 
next year. Your support will in
dicate that your interest in even
ing affairs is reviving and that 
you want more of them during 
the coming year. The revival of 
evening school functions has been 
rather satisfactory as evidenced 
by the success of our three even
ing school dances.
Carnival Classes
The Evening Registrars of
fice wishes to stress the fact 
that evening1 classes will not 
be affected by the Spring Car
nival. However, evening stu
dents who do not have classes 
are invited to attend all the 
phases of the weekend.
Vets Requisitions
Requisitions for equipment 
(including books) and sup
plies will not be honored by 
the book store during the pe
riod May 5 to May 17 in
clusive.
Do You Knoiv?
Of the 17,000 foreign students 
in American educational institu
tions, 3,133 are pursuing engineer
ing courses. There are 937 engi
neering students from nine mid
dle and far east countries alone. 
They are from Greece, Turkey, 
India, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, China, 
the Philippines and Afghanistan. 
Among the students are 955 study
ing mechanical engineering, 706 
civil engineering, 286 chemical 
engineering, 274 mining and me
tallurgical engineering and 263 
electrical engineering.
The first Alumni association at 
Carnegie was formed immediately 
after the first commencement, 
June 17, 1908. This was the 
Alumni association of the School 
of Applied Science and the School 
of Applied Design. Each school 
had its own alumni organization 
until 1912 when they were merged 
under the name of the General 
Alumni association with Andrew 
Carnegie being elected as its first 
honorary member. In 1919 a re
organization took place and the 
name changed to the Carnegie 
Alumni Federation. One of the 
first projects of the Federation 
was the publication of the C.I.T. 
Alumnus, and after that came the 
organization of territorial clubs.

Our spotlight is going to shine 
with pride tonight on a very pret
ty little Miss here on Techs cam
pus. We present to those of you 
who have not had the pleasure of 
meeting her in person, Miss Rose
mary C. Eckles. So shine the 
spotlight over here fellows, while 
we give you a brief description of 
her. A very lovely picture she 
makes being 5 ft. and 4 in. tall, 
golden blond hair with big laugh
ing blue eyes, and weighing about
115 pounds. Yes, we all agree that 
shes very easy on the eyes.
Rosemary, Assistant Social 
Chairman and a member of the 
Plaid Staff, plays a very import
ant role in evening school activi
ties. She was a great asset as she 
strove enthusiastically to sell more 
tickets than anyone else, and we 
were sure to see her friendly 
smiling face as we entered Ad
ministration hall before any so
cial event. Friday evenings she 
can usually be found typing away 
at a very fast speed in the Plaid 
Office, at the Union, doing hei
part in putting out the evening 
school paper.
This lassie is formerly of New 
York where she spent her first 15 
years, but Crafton is now the 
place where she hangs her hat. 
After graduating from South Hills 
High School Rosemary attended 
and completed a course in a Busi
ness School. Soon after she be
came employed on Techs campus 
as a secretary in the Admissions 
office. This makes it very con
venient for her to attend her Eng
lish composition class Monday and 
Friday evenings.
Rosemary is just crazy about 
yes, steak! Our reporter tells us 
that she encountered Rosemary 
eagerly cutting away at a big 
round juicy steak one evening, 
and upon discussing favorite 
dishes Rosemary said, and we 
quote, Theres only one thing I 
enjoy eating more than steak, and 
that is MORE STEAK. If you 
would like to become friendly 
with her, (and who wouldnt), we 
would like to give you a friendly 
tip, and that is, never to call her 
Rosie, for that is her pet peeve.
For entertainment, Rosemary 
can be found playing with Bonnie, 
the familys black cocker spaniel 
pet, in her spare time. She ex
pressed much satisfaction in tell
ing us that Bonnie had 7 pups, one 
of which was a blond, and we be
lieve her when she says, They 
are real cute!. Another favorite 
pastime of hers is dancing to good 
music. When it comes to sports, 
its swimming that heads the list, 
and we know we can count on 
Rosemary to attend the evening 
school swimming party on Satur
day, May 10th. As a hobby she 
delights in sewing, and we were 
surprised to learn that many of 
Rosemarys pretty outfits were 
made by her.
A charming person, a good sport 
with a great sense of humor and 
a friend in need; yes, we are 
proud to claim her as one of us, 
for shes Our Rose.
Registrar Announces Courses 
For Supplementary Term
Ding dong bell, Grace fell in the 
well. Who put her in? How should 
I know. I wasnt there! She said 
she was only trying to gain en
trance to the building via another 
entrance. Who pulled her out? It 
wasnt Clem because I just got 
here to hear about the well.
You should have seen Tom Cuscino at the Engineers Banquet. He 
gnawed off all his fingernails 
waiting for his number to come up 
at the drawing for the door prizes. 
I notice too, that he gnawed off 
his mustache! Vranic should have 
won all the oil; he already used 
up his four quarts.
One Drink Elsie just walked 
in the room with her hat on at a 
jaunty angle.
Oh! what a sight for sore eyes 
It seems that the fellows around 
the Plaid staff havent gotten over 
the Engineers Banquet. All night 
we have been telling jokes and 
not getting out the news.Ban
quet went over bigeven with the 
fried eggs . . . Seems as if the 
professors and doctors sort of 
stressed the fact that 90% of a 
students time should be spent 
meeting people; the other 10% to
wards formulas.
I wonder where Paddy OShaffer, the Irishman, gets all of his 
bow ties. He says they are to keep 
his spirits high. Seems to me that 
what he really means is his double 
chin.
Did any of you notice that smile 
change to a deep frown on Dick 
Strahlers face when his perfect 
experiment proved to be a flop. 
Someone should have told him 
that vacuums are hard to get  
even in Physics.
From what I hear, we are go
ing to be able to get our annual 
bath in the pool again. Comes May 
10th and Ill be expecting to see 
most of you in the passing parade 
of Silver Beach beauties sur
rounding the dunking facilities. I 
think a beauty queen could be in 
the making. Ill try making one 
too! Goodnight folks.
Advanced notification is pre
sented for those students who plan 
to take Supplementary Courses. 
Registration will be held during 
the week of May 12 to 16, and on 
Monday evening, May 19, between 
7:00 and 9:00, and on Wednesday 
evening, May 21, between 6:30
