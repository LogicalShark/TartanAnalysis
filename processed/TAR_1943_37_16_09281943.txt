New Social Calendar 
Announced By ACAC; 
Plans Eight Dances
Miss Rial, Social Chairman of the 
ACAC, has just announced the ten
tative social calendar for this sem
ester. Considering the extremely 
stringent restrictions imposed by 
wartime conditions upon all schoolwide events, the program is very 
promising, and we congratulate 
ACAC on making the very best of a 
bad situation. We must remember 
that, due to the ASTP men station
ed in Thistle Hall, the Gym is avail
able for social affairs only on very 
few Saturday nights, and not at all 
on any other night. Elaborate plans 
such as Carnivals or Festivals are, 
therefore, out for the duration.
Here is the program:
October 1st  Company Bs all
school dance.
October 2ndCwens annual teadance.
October 16thInterhonorary So
ciety victory dance.
October 31st  Womens Guild 
dance.
November 20thIjntersorority 
Council dance.
December 4thCwens Christmas 
dance.
December 7thTag Day.
December 17thSenior Ball.
This list, although by itself al
ready quite impressive, is not neces
sarily complete. Any organization 
planning an all-school dance is urg
ed to carry it out, and should send 
a petition to that effect to Miss Rial 
or the ACAC directly. There are 
still plenty of free nights, and the 
ACAC pledges its cooperation with 
all plans.
A final word to the students. You 
have read so many times about 
school spirit, more pep, and loyalty 
to the school that you are sick and 
tired of hearing the same thing 
again. So, show everyone that you 
do not need peptalks any longer, 
that you have enough spirit without 
long harangues  show them by 
attending your all-school dances.
Correction
We wish to make a correction to 
last weeks TARTAN. It was stated 
in an articleCostume Economic 
and Secretarial Seniors Get Practi
cal Jobsthat the money earned by 
these senior girls goes into a fund 
which buys a bond for the adminis
tration at the end of the year. 
Technically this is not true. Instead 
of using the money to buy a bond 
for the Administration, it does some
thing which means much more. The 
bond is bought for the Endowment 
Fund of Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology. In other words, the Chair
man of the Board of Trustees in 
New York will, in 1946, give two 
dollars for every one dollar that has 
been invested in the Endowment 
Fund.
Chang Dunn Dies; Two Important Assemblies 
Crashes In Texas j 11 e Presented October 5
The news has just reached us that 
Second Lieutenant Harold Chang 
Dunn was killed last Friday morn
ing in a plane crash near El Paso, 
Texas.
Chang, a printing major in the 
class of 1941, and star center on our 
football team, had received his basic 
training at Chapel Hill, North Caro
lina, Pre-Flight School, and further 
schooling at the Pensacola Naval 
Air Training Center in Florida. On
ly a few weeks ago he graduated 
from there as a Second Lieutenant 
in the Marine Corps, and then spent 
two weeks leave with his parents 
in Pittsburgh before leaving for the 
advanced Training Station at San 
Diego.
There is little need for further 
details, for we all knew Chang. 
During his years at Tech, and again 
during the last few days, when he 
assisted Coach Skladany on the 
gridiron, his fine personality and 
rich sense of humor made him 
everybodys friend. He was one of 
the outstanding persons on the cam
pus, and everyone ,professors and 
students alike, was proud of his 
friendship.
His death is a great loss to his 
friendshis fraternity brothers at 
the Beta Sig house, his teachers and 
classmates, and all who knew him 
and we mourn with those he left 
behind: his parents, Mr. and Mrs. 
Charles Dunn, of 6379 Alderson 
Street, his sisters Beatrice and Shir
ley, and his two brothers, Cpl. 
George Dunn of the Ferry Com
mand, stationed in Brazil, and Pvt. 
living at Maxwell Field.
We shall always remember you, 
Chang . . . semper fidelis.
ROTC Juniors Return
Colonel Bass has just announced, 
that approximately one hundred of 
the ROTC Juniors, who were called 
to active duty last spring, will re
turn to the campus tomorrow. A 
few others, who have not yet finish
ed their basic training, will come 
back within the next month.
The boys will be regular mem
bers of the ASTP, and expect to be 
stationed here for at least several 
months.
Freshmen Will Attend 
Army First Aid Movie
In order to emphasize the impor
tance of knowing how to administer 
proper care in everyday accidents, 
a regular army film on First Aid 
will be presented to all freshmen 
on Tuesday morning; October 5, at 
11:00 in room 104 Industries Hall.
This assembly, which has already 
become a custom at Tech, is given 
in connection with the Hygiene 
classes to coordinate their work with 
that of the ROTC. Captain William 
Shaffer of the ROTC and Mr. Allen 
Risedorf are the co-sponsors.
Cwens Open Season 
With Fall Tea Dance 
Held in Exhibition Hall
Carnegies dancing shoes will be 
taken out of the mothballs when the 
Cwens keep the social ball rolling 
with an All-Campus Tea Dance to 
be held on Saturday, October 2, 
from 3:30 to 5:30 in the Exhibition 
Hall, College of Fine Arts. For only 
30 cents per person, the gals in red 
and gray promise a gala afternoon 
complete with refreshments and our 
favorite bandson records, natcherly! This being the first tea dance 
of the year, a large turnout is ex
pected. And we really mean allcampus, says prexy Helen Jaffurs. 
That definitely includes the A. S. 
T.s.
Tickets will go on sale this week 
for what promises to be one of the 
gayest social events of the year. 
Lets get behind this and show all 
the skeptics that we are not lacking 
in school spirit. Besides, well have 
a good time.
Women Plan Annual 
Color Day Assembly
Traditions exams may just be a 
reminder of pre-war days to all 
Techs upperclassmen, but to the cur
rent class of Margaret Morrison 
freshman women who must pass 
them in order to attend Color Day, 
they signify an important event.
Following a long established cus
tom, the Margaret Morrison Senate, 
under the leadership of their Presi
dent Dorothy Schadel, will present 
on Tuesday, October 5, at 11:00 in 
the Little Theatre the annual Color 
Day assembly, during which time 
ribbons will be pinned on those 
girls who successfully passed their 
exams. The ribbons, which entitle 
the girls to discard their armbands, 
will be red and gray, the colors of 
last years senior class.
To conclude the program Miss 
Douglass, instructor in the Science 
department and newly appointed 
Freshman Advisor, will be present
ed with a bouquet of flowers, as a 
welcoming gesture from the girls.
In addition to the above program, 
Miss Schadel also revealed that a 
special treat is in store for the new 
class, as an innovation this year, 
the members of the Senate are going 
to act as hostesses at a tea which 
they are giving for all Margaret 
Morrison freshmen and the various 
class sponsors that same afternoon 
from four to five-thirty in the Mar
garet Morrison recreation hall, 
fourth floor.

one of the boys
. . . Gail Litton
CcQifoli. A>ufteUcU>i---------------------------
The other day I overheard a girl saying that she wished the war 
would soon be over because she wanted to get married then. Frankly I 
dont believe it. Ive heard lots of boys say that they hoped that the war 
would soon end so they could go on with certainty in their chosen profes
sions, but what do you think? These folks talk as though the ending of 
the war were a prerequisite for the resuming of normal life, and yet they 
dont even carry their own small share of the burden. Now, I wouldnt 
want to see every American boy rush out willy-nilly and enlist when he 
may be more important in his home-front work. I dont think that every 
girl should join the WACs or get a defense job, but I do know that all of 
us should give every bit of support to the war effort. Im not talking of 
the sacrifice of things such as good clothes, abundant food, or frequent 
trips to the country. The time has come for us to consider the war in terms 
of dollars and cents. It may seem trite to say that the more we give for 
war bonds now, the sooner the war will be over; and that the sooner we 
bring our boys back, the more we will be able to bring back; but it is 
literally true. Any logical person will agree.
Another thing that has been stressed so often, but is being ignored 
right now, is the fact that there are many ways this war could still be lost. 
If that should happen (God forbid!) nothing American would be worth 
anything at all. Wouldnt a few bonds now seem like a small investment 
for our national life insurance? Remember, too, that the cost of waging the 
war is now more than $2,000,000 a day. We and our progeny will have to 
pay every penny of this tremendous sum eventually. Wouldnt it seem 
wiser to lend a little now, when money is so desperately needed and most 
of us have a little more to spend, than to wait until it has to be taxed out 
of our slimmer postwar pay checks? If you want to be idealistic about it, 
you could call your contribution a patriotic duty; if not, remember that 
those who have bonds will still be aheadthey will get back 133% on 
every dollar they invest now in war bonds. One thing the United States 
fias to be proud of is that its bonds have always been as good as its word, 
so were pretty sure of getting our money back. And if it must be used 
then to pay more taxes, well, pity the poor fellows who wont have that 
extra one-third on every dollar!
So now there is a Third War Loan campaign being carried on at Tech, 
which is being supported almost solely by the faculty. Even so, results 
have been so disheartening that it has been extended until this coming 
Friday to enable students to do some active participation. We all know 
that Tech students cant buy bonds by the handful, but I dont know a soul 
who couldnt afford a few war stamps every weekfor the duration. But 
seeing that we will still have this week to contribute to the drive, lets 
make a Special effort to boost our score a little. Im going home to dig out 
my stamp book, the necessary $2.75 additional, and buy that bond! What 
are you going to do?
Letters To The Editor
Dear Editor:
In answer to last weeks letter, I 
wish to inform Mr. Al. Ganschow 
not to get so excited. In the first 
place, there are cheerleaders who 
have been practicing religiously 
every Monday afternoon. I think 
if he had kept his ears open, he 
might have heard them, for the 
doors and windows of the girls gym 
have been open wide. Then, there 
are only four left from last years 
squad, three of whom are the girls 
who were added for the first time 
last spring. Freshmen have been 
trying out to replace the ones that 
were lost.
In the second place, as I recall, 
there never were any pep rallies 
until the night before the game, and 
I know for a fact that there are two 
scheduled for the nights before our 
two home games.
As for the band, that I dont know, 
but I do know that the cheerleaders 
arent going to let the team down. 
So Id like to ask Mr. Ganschow to 
get the student body behind the 
cheerleaders and the team when the 
time comes.
Respectfully,
Ruthie Means.
Techs newest football hope is 
blonde Gail Litton, who is playing 
for the first time this year. He 
comes from Hancock, a little place 
in Maryland thats getting down in 
the hills. He came to Tech partly 
because his brother had gone to 
school here and party because this is 
one of the countrys better mechani
cal engineering schools. His drawl
ing speech makes him seem like the 
sort of person who avoids anything 
active, but thats where he fools 
you.
Since he came to school, hes play
ed in all the intramural sports; and 
right now he is right end on the var
sity football team. He is on the 
Intramural Board, piesident of the 
Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, 
and corresponding secretary of Pi 
Tau Sigma. Last year he was presi
dent of Scobell Hall and a member 
of Mens Dormitory Council. These 
are hardly the activities of an indo
lent on-looker.
His pre-Tech life was keyed at a 
pace just as fast as it is now; he 
worked with a structural steel con
struction gang, helped a surveyor, 
and even jerked sodas for a while. 
Between times he went camping, 
played tennis, swum, and fooled 
around with boats as well as built 
model airplanes and worked with 
photography.
When he graduates in December, 
aero engineer Litton hopes to go into 
some branch of the Navy that has to 
do with aeronautics. Before he goes, 
he would like to see more social life 
and dances around Tech; he loves 
to dance. His idea of a good life is

He gave a housemother the shock 
of her life once by appearing on the
front porch of a girls dorm half
dressed, blindfolded, and tied to a 
chair. His frisky playmates, who 
had decided to celebrate his birth
day in an unusual way, had rung the 
doorbell and disappeared. One 
glimpse of Gail sent the chaperone 
tearing back to her room; one of her 
charges finally came down to loosen 
his bonds and blindfold. What real
ly added insult to injury was the 
fact that he had to go back carrying 
the chairhe had been tied to his 
own. Such is the life of Gail Litton

... Situation Normal...
Look bud!the voice is bitter 
youve been at that wash basin thir
ty-eight and one-half minutes by my 
Ingersollits time you terminate 
the lease and move onand when 
you doplease be so good as to re
turn my tooth paste, soap, and what 
is left of my shaving creamI too 
must look good to my public.
Now this kind of talkso early in 
the morningalways makes me feel 
bad. Particularly when it is ad
dressed to me. And, besides, I 
didnt have his soap. And his brand 
of tooth paste is strictly for the 
birdstastes like reveille whistle 
sounds.
All of which leads me to remark 
... as I circulate a few well-aimed 
gobs of paste in his direction . . . 
that on him a combat outfit would 
look good ... if it meant that he was 
far enough away from CIT ASTP.
Thats o.k. with me ... he re
sponds . . . overseas duty is what I 
was trained for . . . and . . . after my 
vacation here is over . . . probably 
what I will get plenty of ... in big 
chunks. Didnt Marshall say some
thing about five million men slated 
for that long trip by the end of 44? 
Sure he did ... I interpose humor
ously .. . and I suppose that you just 
cant wait to go three fast rounds 
with malaria in Port Moresby or to 
mix with a Mark VI in Milan.
All right... so I take Joe Palooka 
too seriously . . . he admits . . . but 
somebodys got to fight the Germans 
and Japs . . . and it might as well be 
me. Those boys have to be shown 
whos boss. Its either tHem or us.
Except Football
Continued from page one 
of their captors to dripping bundles 
of shivering humanity . . . and all 
that just for a good education.
September 28, 1938 . . . The Stu
dent Council is in trouble again . . . 
TARTAN editorial comment:  . . . 
To the average student the Council 
means nothing . . . the Student Body 
has the duty to express their opin
ions to the Council . . . this is your 
last opportunity, students. If you 
fail to support the Council this year, 
your privilege of having a free form 
of government is endangered ... 
Sounds familiar, doesnt it?
September 28, 1938 . . . The gridmen are looking forward to an in
teresting schedule . . . games are on 
their list with Davis Elkins, Spring
field, Holy Cross, Notre Dame, 
Akron, Pitt, Duquesne, and North 
Carolina . \. . Carnegie has a good 
team this year ... Bill Kern is again 
coaching . . . hopes are high for a 
good season. (Note: we were head
ed for the Sugar Bowl).
September 28, 1938 . . . and as the 
semester begins to roll along, things 
happen here and there ... two archi
tect majors win $300 in a nation
wide house designing contest . . . 
Dr. Frocht speaks at the fifth Inter
national Congress for Applied Me
chanics at MIT . . . and at Pitt the 
staff of the Pitt News is in the dog
house for publishing a disrespectful 
article about the late Andrew W. 
Mellon. Will the gang across Forbes 
Street ever learn that the old ivyclad pile of rocks does not subsist on 
pennies from heaven?
The fog is settling . . . slowly . . . 
and we are back in 1943 . . . five 
years later.
That is genuinely fine talk ... I de
clare as I wipe away a fleck of foam 
from behind my left ear . . . for it 
you deserve another Junior Com
mando award. And after you per
sonally have dealt the final crushing 
blow to the Axis ... I say ... I pre
sume you are going to reenlist for 
the Russian Campaign?
This takes a while to seep in. First 
he passes a few unhealthy remarks 
about guys who would shave all 
morning while their grandmother 
was burning . . . and something to 
the effect that the effort I was mak
ing was not justified by the results 
. . . then his gray matter starts to 
homogenize. What kind of doubletalk are you giving me about Russia 
he demands. Theyre on our side. 
Weve got a common enemy. The 
Russians are our friends.
At the moment they are . . I
answer . . . but what happens when 
Tojo and Hitler are taken care of? 
Then Russia is a problem. Unless 
we work with her. Which isnt too 
likely . Even now some of the boys 
are saying that we shouldnt waste 
too much of our military strength 
on a second front nor send too much 
lend-lease to Russia because if we do 
Russia will take advantage of our 
weakness to assume a dominant role 
in world affairs. A lot of the lads 
trust Russia as far as they could 
throw Kate Smith. And Russia 
probably wouldnt give us the com
bination to her safe either.
Thats what you get for spending 
so much time in the bathroom . . . 
he rejoins . . . having a pitifully onetracked mind. If you would get out 
into the sunshine more . . . you 
wouldnt be so full of that stuff. 
Russia is our ally. That is all there 
is to it. And if youre not away 
from that basin in ten seconds . . . 
you will have to perform an extrac
tion job on this G. I. shoe!
I can take a hint. But as I ease 
out, I insist that he should thank me 
for getting him accustomed to pri
vations ... on account of there are 
very few first-class bathrooms in 
Dniepropetrovsk.

fjuit tf-QJl 1j04J-!
Reporter Has Trouble 
Finding Nixon Star
By Lucille Schulberg
This is the story of an interview.
Edith Skinner, Voice and Speech 
professor, told me that Miss Elena 
Miramova, one of her former pupils 
who wrote and plays the lead in 
Dark Eyes (last week, Nixon The
atre) was coming to visit the Drama 
Department Thursday. With her 
would be Miss Cornish, head of the 
famous Cornish School in California, 
who was going to speak to the fresh
men informally during their after
noon class. Would I care to inter
view her for the TARTAN. Love to. 
Bien.
Comes Thursday, cool and crisp. 
Having returned at great speed from 
a small beauty salon (where some 
woman cut off half my right index 
finger) I dashed madly in and out 
of the Arts Building looking for Mrs. 
Skinners dialect classes, where two 
ladies, one with very black hair and 
a Russian toque; the other, fair, 
were looking out into space. Well, 
not really into space. Kind of to
wards the stair.
Them, I murmured ungram
matically, and ran to the TAR
TAN office for a photographer. It 
would have been a lovely picture for 
the head of this columnwomen 
around a microphone, etc.but no 
photographer was forthcoming so I 
blazed back to the Radio Room to 
find them gone. Still running, I 
bounded into the Studio Theatre 
where the freshman class was held. 
The metal crash of the door as I

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1943
Ut Khaki . . .
By Gerald Brickman
Another Tech alumnus is now the 
proud wearer of the cherished Navy 
Wings of Gold. Ensign William 
H. Bartles has just graduated from 
the Annapolis of the Air, the Naval 
Air Training Center at Pensacola, 
Florida. '
Bill Bartles has chosen naval avia
tion for his career in the armed 
forces and has received his commis
sion as ensign after graduating from 
Pensacola. He will soon go on active 
duty at one of the Navys operation
al training centers before being as
signed to a combat zone.
Word reaches us of still another 
alumnus who is now in the Navy. 
Fred Graff, who six,.years ago cut 
a handsome figure as the drummajor of the Kiltie band, is again 
turning feminine hearts in his en
signs uniform. While at Tech, Fred, 
a musicamajor, was student director 
of the Mens Glee Club and assistant 
director of the band. After gradua
tion, he was made music director of 
Stowe High School until his recent 
apointment to the Notre Dame Mid
shipman school, where he organized 
the drum and bugle corps. At the 
moment, Fred is in Florida at a 
training center for the crews of PT 
boats.
Bruce Buttles stands out as an
other alumnus, who, by his deeds, 
is doing much to bring credit to 
Tech. After graduating from Co
lumbia University in 1938, Bruce 
came to Carnegie Tech to take up 
printing in order to acquire the me
chanical knowledge necessary for 
newspaper work. While at Colum
bia, he served as the New York rep
resentative for the Christian Science 
Monitor. During his sophomore year, 
Bruce started with the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette and became assistant 
city editor in a few months. He was 
a reserve officer in the army when 
he came to Carnegie, holding the 
rank of Second Lieutenant; and, in 
September, 1940, he was called to 
active duty in the Quartermaster 
Corps at Fort Meade, Maryland. 
Transferred from there to Washing
ton, Bruce joined the Air Corps, in 
the fall of 1941, and was sent to Eng
land where he was attached to the 
American embassy as a special 
Army observer. Still stationed in 
England in the early part of 1943, 
he was promoted to the rank of 
-major. In a recent letter to Profes
sor Cleeton, head of the Printing 
Department, Bruce writes:
I am very comfortably situated 
in one of the loveliest and most his
toric parts of England. At the estate 
where I am billeted with two RAF 
officers, there are two fine old gar
deners whom I supply with tobacco 
every now and then in order to get 
chummy over seasonal problems.
Records
The following programs have 
been selected for the record recitals 
to be given in room 157 in the Fine 
Arts Building between 12:00 and 
1:00:
Tuesday, September 28, 1943 
Symphony No. 5..............................
.................... Dmitri Shostakovitch
Thursday, September 30, 1943 
Symphony No. 3............Jan Sibelius
Bruce was only a few credits short 
of his degree when he was called to 
service and insists that he will be 
back after the war to get this de
gree.
It is a very interesting sidelight 
to note that out of four hundred 
fifty graduates of the Printing De
partment, one hundred fifty have 
joined the armed forces. One other 
graduate of the Printing Depart
ment, Karl F. Hausauer, is also serv
ing with the rank of Lt. Colonel.
Andrew R. Gallagher, a former 
student of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, has been selected as an 
aviation cadet at Brooks Field, Tex
as. The son of Mr. and Mrs. Bernard 
Gallagher, 1301 3rd Avenue, New 
Kensington, Cadet Gallagher in ci
vilian life was employed by the 
Aluminum Company of America. 
Before qaulifying for pilot training, 
he served as an enlisted man at At
lantic City and La Guardia Field. He 
received his primary Air Corps in
struction at Bruce Field, Texas, fol
lowed by basic flying at Porrin 
Field, Sherman, Texas.
At Brooks, he will fly high-power
ed, twin-engined training planes for 
the first time. Upon graduation 
from this course on November 3rd, 
Cadet Gallagher will be classified as 
a second lieutenant.

According to Webster, a carica

part of Dr. Chworowsky, who is as
sociate professor of Psychology and 
Education. Dr. Chworowsky was 
born in San Antonio, Texas, and 
spent most of his childhood in Min
nesota. Due to the fact that his 
father was a minister, and did a 
great deal of traveling, Dr. Chwo
rowsky lived in many different 
states and cities as a youth. After 
completing his studies at Milwaukee 
High School, he went to Harvard 
University and later to Harvard 
Law School. Upon the completion 
of his studies at Harvard, he took a 
position teaching in a private ooys 
school in the East. From there he 
proceeded to Ohio State University, 
Parent Education Institutes, Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, from whence he 
came to Carnegie Tech.

Thus far, my interview with Miss 
Miromova wasnt . . . After the talk, 
Mrs. Skinnerdid introduce me to 
Miss Miramova and the fair lady, 
who was Tamara Geva, co-star of 
Dark Eyes (and much adored by 
BG the Magnificent). Miss Geva, a 
dancer, began wondering what made 
Pittsburghers so deadly as an audi
ence.
Are they afraid of their emo
tions? Are they frustrated? Are 
they afraid to release themselves?
She was upset. This play, which 
had New York howling for a full 
season or more, evoked little more 
than occasional quivers from Nixon 
houses.
About then a cab rolled up. 
Everybody was going to a party. No 
time for an interview. I thought 
rather about eight inches of naked 
paper in the middle of the next issue 
of the TARTAN, but Miss Miromova 
was kind; she rescued me.

tion of the students at Carnegie Tech 
is that they are too docile. They 
are, he says, easily enthused, but 
there is no sustained effort. This 
comment comes as a result of Dr. 
Chworowskys serving as chairman 
of the Carnegie Tech War Activi
ties Committee where he has had 
a great deal of opportunity to ob

Dr. Chworowsky is the idea of 
most Carnegie Tech students of a 
perfect professor, for he is really

I studied a great deal to lose it,

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Company B Team 
Whips Co. E, 25-0
Playing a beautiful ball game de
spite their holding the short end of 
the odds, the regimental orphans 
upset Company E in a wide open 
football game. Lts. Pickerel, Thom
as and Courtney, plus a host of Co. 
E men and civilians watched the 
well-trained, well coached boys of 
Industries Hall go down in defeat to 
a packup squad of 11 men gathered 
from the dormitories of Co. B in a 
last minute rush to put a team on 
the field.
It was quite a contest, and at the 
end of the half the game had resolv
ed itself into a scoring spree. In 
the first quarter, B scored via a lat
eral from QB Selke to Shellar, and 
then a forty-yard pass to Billy DeVos for a score. The attempt to con
vert failed, and the score was 6-0. 
That ended the scoring for the quar
ter as the no-substitute B team 
dominated the period.
In the second quarter, Co. B open
ed up with a running and passing 
attack that again placed Sgt. Dobbs 
boys in scoring position. A pass 
from Ed Selke to Fonte accounted 
for another tally and the score mov
ed to 12-0. The attempt at the extra 
point was good as Selkes pass to 
Fleming changed the score to 13-0.
The third quarter saw the Co. E 
team go on the offensive. In succes
sive plays they gained ground for a 
first down. The next three downs 
failed to produce the needed ten 
yards, and the E fullback faded back 
for a kick. Bs halfback, Shellar, 
crashed through the line to block 
the kick. B took possession of the 
ball and started back down the field. 
Bob Topping threw a long pass to 
Shellar, who jumped high in the air 
to catch the ball amidst a host of E 
men. The ball was over the goal line 
and the score moved up to 19-0.
The final touchdown came in the 
last quarter with but a few minutes 
to play. Ed Selke took the ball on 
Es forty yard line and, following 
Bill DeVos, ran for the last tally. 
DeVos blocking was superb as he 
bowled over three would-be tacklers. 
Final score: 25-0.
The game itself was marked by 
rough and tough line play and fast 
backfield activity by both teams. Es 
victory over Company F and its sub
sequent defeat at the hands of Co. B 
places B in top position.
For the Co. E squad, Clark and 
Elting bore the brunt of the attack. 
QB Clark tried desperately to rally 
the routed E forces, but attempt 
after attempt failed against the B 
stone wall. Coach Heintz used no 
substitutes as a gesture of sports
manship.
Referees Mullaney and Neastines 
did a fine job and handled the game 
well.

Odds With Rochester
Instead of having to build up a 
reputation in football this year, the 
University of Rochester found itself 
in the position of having to discount 
exaggerated reports of its alleged 
dazzling array of gridiron talent. 
So reads the first line of a publicity 
release from Rochester. It is ques
tionable whether'or not the reports 
were exaggerated.
Let us take a brief look at Roches
ter. Never heard of it? That is not 
surprising. Until this year, the Col
lege for Men numbered about 650 
students. This and the resulting 
lack of good football material limit
ed the school to small college com
petition. The advent of the Navy 
College Training Program brought 
803 V-12 students from 52 different 
colleges. In addition, the Mens Col
lege includes about 220 civilians. 
From these, a squad of 62 men has 
been formed including 8 centers (5 
with college experience), 13 guards, 
(11 experienced), 12 ends (9 experi
enced), and 17 backs, (14 experi
enced). The tackle position, ac
cording to the report, appears to be 
one of the weakest spots, with only 
three or four of the twelve candi
dates having had much college ex
perience.
Techs first game can easily be its 
toughest. Our study-worn engineers 
will have their hands full. The ma
rines and sailors are much heavier 
and more experienced. But maybe 
just maybe.

weiner roast held at Forest Hills 
Park on Sunday, September 19.
This affair was one of a series of 
such gatherings held during the past 
year. This park was found to be the 
most convenient to reach because of 
the curtailment of non-essential 
driving.
Food was plentiful, the ball games

the men cook for the women-folk.
