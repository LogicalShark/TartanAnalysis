TECH LOSES TO ALLEGHENY
Before the biggest crowd w^hich has witnessed a 
game on Techs field this season, Carnegie went down 
to defeat before the strong, husky team from Alle
gheny College. The final score was 270. The game 
was interesting throughout and the defenders of 
the Plaid displayed admirable courage and nerve 
before their heavier and more experienced op
ponents.
Dyer again played a brilliant game. 
His work upon the defensive was phenomenal; on 
the offensive, his ability to carry the ball gained 
many yards for Tech. During the third period, he 
pulled off one of the greatest tackles ever seen upon 
Tech field. Newbrand got the ball when Fullback 
Miller fumbled on her 8-yard line. Tech tried a for
ward pass and fumbled. In the mad scramble which 
followed, an Allegheny man secured the ball and 
broke away from the crowd of players for what ap
peared to be a certain touchdown. In a second, the 
figure of a Tech man emerged from the struggling 
mass and the crowd held its breath while the play
ers raced toward Techs goal. Dyer pulled his man 
down from behind, 20 yards from the goal line. The 
applause which greeted Deweys burst of speed 
was something long to be remembered.
Kesselman played a good game at the other end. 
His tackling was swift and sure. McCorkle, who 
was substituted for Kesselman in the last quarter, 
also did some neat tackling. Techs best ground 
gainers were Schmucker and Taylor. The latter con
tributed a 30-yard run from a forward-pass, while 
Schmucker gained consistently throughout the game. 
The most successful of the plays tried by Tech were 
forward passes and a fake kick ending in a circling 
end run.
Allegheny uncovered a very pretty play during the 
last quarter. The ball was first passed to the quarter
back, who started for one end only to pass the ball 
to one of the halves. He, in turn, made a long, 
diagonal forward pass across the line to one of the 
ends. This play almost gave Allegheny another 
touchdown, as the end was not downed until he had 
reached the 5-yard line.
However Tech held here, and her opponents were 
forced to attempt a goal from the field. Allegheny 
had goon intereference for her men throughout the 
game, even the center getting into some of the end 
plays. This enabled W. Dotterel, Lavely ,and Perley 
to make a number of long end runs, Perley at one 
time going 70 yards for a touchdown.
The rooting at the game was good. The 
Tech men were on the job every minute. Allegheny 
sent down quite a number of rooters and their cheer 
leader had them yelling at all times. During the 
intermission both they and the Tech rooters had a 
snake walk around the field, meeting in front of the 
grand stand to exchange cheers. The feeling be
tween the schools, both on the field and in the stand, 
was of the best.
The Game in Detail.
Schmucker kicked off to W. Dotteral on the 25- 
yard line. He advanced the ball but 4 yards before 
he was tackled. Johnston circled tackle for 8 yards. 
Lavely could not gain at end, and furthermore was 
penalized 5 yards for crawling with the ball. Miller 
then kicked to his 50-yard line, where Hawk re
covered the ball. Lavely skirted tackle to Techs 34- 
yard line and then gained 4 yards through the line. 
Johnston failed to gain and Miller fell back for a 
drop kick. This went wild and Tech put the ball in

scrimmage on her 25-yard line. Newbrand could not 
gain through the line, but slid around tackle for 4 
yards on the next try. Schmucker then punted to 
Dotterel on Techs 47-yard line. Johnston lost 3 
yards in trying to round Dyer, but Miller gained 5 
through guard. However, the officials ruled that he 
had crawled with the ball and Allegheny was set 
back to the 50-yard line. Miller then punted to 
Blanchard on the 30-yard line. Newbrand fumbled 
the next pass but recovered the ball for a loss of 
10-yards. Taylor could not gain at end and Schmucker 
kicked to W. Dotterel on the 52-yard line. Johnston 
then circled Techs end and carried the ball on the 
33-yard line. Miller gained 3 yards at center, and 6 
yards through tackle. Johnston, Lavely and Miller 
each gained 4 yards through the line and W. Dotterel 
carried it over for the first touchdown of the game. 
Miller kicked goal.
Schmucker kicked off to Allegheny on the 25-yard 
line. Dotterel gained 6 yards and Lavely 1 at tackle 
and Miller punted to Taylor on Techs 40-yard line. 
Acting captain Jimmie ran it back 7 yards. New
brand gained 3 yards at tackle. Taylor then fumbled 
and Allegheny got the ball on Techs 41-yard line. 
Johnston and Miller could gain only a yard and the 
latter punted to Blanchard on the 10-yard line. He 
advanced the ball 8 yards before being downed. 
Schmucker gained 4 yards on a forward pass and 
Dyer recovered an onside kick by Taylor on the 45- 
yard line. Schmucker gained a yard at center. Alle
gheny then partly blocked a forward pass but a Tech 
man fell on the ball on the 51-yard line. Newbrand 
lost 3 yards at tackle. The whistle then blew for the 
end of the quarter.
On a fake kick play directed at Alleghenys left 
end, Blanchard gained 7 yards, but fumbled, and 
Hawk gathered in the ball. Johnston circled the 
end for a run which terminated when Blanchard got 
him on the 20-yard line. Miller gained 5 yards at 
center. On the next play, Hawk drew a 15-yard
penalty for holding, and the ball was placed on the 
30-yard line. Miller gained 3 yards at guard. The 
same player then attempted a field goal from place
ment, only to see it go wide. Tech scrimmaged the 
ball on the 25-yard line. Schmucker gained 4 yards , 
at end, but Blanchard lost 2 yards on an attempted
forward pass to Dyer. Schmucker gained 22 yards
on a fake kick play around end. Blanchard lost 11 
yards at end but 1 aylor carried the ball 30 yards, 
after receiving a short forward pass. This put the 
ball on Alleghenys 42-yard line. Allegheny then
blocked a forward pass on the 43-yard line. Miller 
gained 5 yards at tackle, only to see it lost on the 
next play when one of the guards was offside. Miller 
kicked to Blanchard on Techs 40-yard line. Taylor 
punted out of bounds on Alleghenys 45-yard line. 
From that point, Johnston rounded Techs end for a 
touchdown. The punt out failed and Allegheny could 
not kick goal. Score, 110.
Schmucker kicked to W. Dotterel on the 25-yard 
line, and he returned it 20 yards. Lavely gained 9 
yards at end, and Johnston went through tackle for 
11 yards, Dyer finally pulling him down from behind.
Miller gained 5 yards at guard and then gained 3 at 
tackle. On the next play Weaver nailed the same 
player for a loss of 3 yards. This gave the ball to 
Tech on her 39-yard line. Allegheny pulled down a 
forward pass intended for Dyer, on the 45-yard line. 
Johnston filtered through tackle for 5 yards, but on 
the next play Allegheny was offside and the distance 
was lost. Miller ^punted to Blanchard on the 15-yard 
line. Weaver gained 4 yards through guard and 
Schmucker punted to Townsend on the 26-yard line. 
Lavely gained 2 yards at end, but a forward pass 
ended disastrously, no one being there to receive it. 
Miller then failed to drop kick a field goal from the 
35-yard line and the half was over.
The second half was. ushered in when Schmucker 
kicked off to Townsend on the 20-yard line. He 
gained 9 yards before he was stopped. Dyer dropped 
Lavely for no gain, and the latter was penalized 5 
yards for crawling with the ball. Miller gained 3 
yards at guard and then punted to Taylor on the 55- 
yard line. Jimmie gained 25 yards before Alle
gheny could stop him. Taylor made a yard at center 
and Dyer, on a fake kick gained 5 more. Dyer then 
failed to make first down, by inches. W. Dotterel 
gained 9 yards to the 30-yard line on a fake kick, and 
Miller made 6 yards and first down through tackle. 
Two forward passe3 failed and Miller kicked out of 
bounds on the 42-yard line. Schmucker gained 2 
yards at end. Allegheny intercepted a forward pass 
on the 25-yard line, Miller sifted through tackle to 
the 46-yard line and Dotterel circled end for 8 yards 
more. Johnston failed to gain at tackle. Miller 
punted out of bounds on Techs 21-yard line. 
Schmucker punted to Dotterel who ran back the ball 
10 yards to Techs 30-yard line. Dotterel skirted 
Techs end as far as the 12-yard line and Lavely, in 
two tries at tackle, gained 9 yards. Here Engstrom 
hurt his leg and Blair took his place. Dotterel went 
through the line, for a touch down, but Allegheny 
failed to kick goal. Schmucker kicked off to Town
send cn the 30-yard line, but he was penalized to the 
25-yard line for crawling. Allegheny fumbled and 
Newbrand got to the 8-yard line with it before 
Dotterel nailed him. An Allegheny man then caught 
a forward pass and ran it to Techs 21-yard line. This 
was the time when Dyer made his sensational sprint 
arid tackle. Perley was substituted for Johnston 
just before the whistle blew for the end of the 
quarter.
After the three minutes were up, Perley gained 4 
yards at tackle and then fumbled, a Tech man getting 
the ball. Blanchard circled end for 6 yards. Dyer 
was then called back, and, on a fake kick, gained 2 
yards. Schmucker punted to the 35-yard line but the 
ball was brought back and given to Allegheny on the 
25-yard line because Schmucker was not 5 yards be
hind the line. Hawk then gained 20 yards on a for
ward pass from Perley. Perley twice failed to gain 
and Miller attempted to drop kick a goal from the 
field. Dyer punted out from the 20-yard line to 
Hawk on Alleghenys 50-yard line. He advanced it 
to the center of the field. Here Scott was substituted 
for Lloyd. Perley gained 5 yards at tackle and

Dotterel circled the end to the 28-yard line. McCorkle went in for Kesselman. Miller gained 2 yards 
at guard and Lavely could gain only 2 more at tackle 
before Blair got him. Miller attempted a place kick. 
It was partialy blocked, and Allegheny recovered the 
ball on 4-yard line. Miller lost 3 yards at center but 
Perley went around tackle for all but six inches of 
the necessary distance. Perley carried the ball over 
and W. Dotterel kicked goal.
Here Balph and Patterson went in for Dyer and 
Schmucker, as both men were tired out. Blanchard 
kicked off to Kennedy on the 30-yard line, where McCorkle downed him as soon as he had caught the 
ball. Miller gained 4 yards through Weaver and 
Dotterel took the ball around end to Techs 50-yard 
line. Blanchard stopped him by a very pretty tackle. 
Perley gained 8 yards in two attempts at tackle, and 
Miller kicked out of bounds on Techs 5-yard line. 
Blanchard punted to Perley on the 35-yard line and 
he returned it half of the distance to the goal line 
by some very pretty dodging. Dotterel then carried 
it over for a touchdown. He failed to kick goal. 
Critchlow took Gilkinsons place at guard. Blanchard 
kicked off to Miller on the 15-yard line. After he had 
been tackled on the 25-yard line, the whistle blew and 
the game was over.

BASKETBALL BENEFIT.
The new Athletic Field House will be the scene of 
a concert and dance, Monday evening, November 21. 
The affair will be the first of its kind to be held in 
the new gym, and a large crowd will be in attend
ance. The proceeds will go towards the. support of 
the basketball team. Manager Blanchard of the 
basketball team, who has the affair in charge, has 
arranged an attractive evenings entertainment. 
From 8:15 to 9:30 a concert will be givlen. Hunter 
Johnsons troupe of colored entertainers, headed by 
Big Bub Jenkins, will present a program of old 
plantation and jubilee songs which will make your 
heart melt. Mr. Jenkins, who has just returned from 
an extended European tour, during which he has 
gained an enviable reputation as a vocalist, will sing 
his famous Laughing Song. The well-known 
Eureka Quartete will also be on the bill, besides sev
eral instrumentalists of worth. Following the con
cert, the evening will be devoted to dancing until 1 
oclock. The new floor and a good orchestra will be 
a combination hard to excel.
The management is doing everything in its power 
to make the evening a success. The cause is a 
worthy one and every Tech man should boost. Buy 
a ticket, get a girl and join the throng. You cant 
put a dollar to a better purpose.
CRUCIBLE CLUB.
A very successful meeting of the Crucible Club was 
held in Room 216, Friday evening, Nov. 4th. After 
the routine business was transacted, G. C. Bauer, 
Junior Chemist, gave a very commendable talk on 
Recent Advances in the Paint Industry. Mr. Bauer 
was especially qualified to speak on the subject, hav
ing spent the summer in the employ of the Harrison 
Paint Company of Philadelphia. He spoke particu
larly of the modern technical methods of paint test
ing, illustrating his remarks by means of black-board 
sketches. Following Mr. Bauers talk H. G. Lamker, 
Junior Metallurgist, read a paper on Zinc Distilla
tion. The process described was shown to be very 
unsatisfactory from a metallurgical standpoint, but 
was treated in a skillful and satisfactory manner.
Following the reading of the papers, the eats 
committee served an excellent feed, and the usual 
social spirit prevailed. The attendance as a whole 
was good. Many of the Sophomores, perhaps not 
realizing the benefits to be gained by attending the 
meetings of the Club, fail to show proper interest. 
It is urged that they attend the future meetings 
regularly. The program committee is planning the 
meetings for the year and will soon announce a com
plete schedule. Many men prominent in the in
dustries of the Pittsburgh district are to favor the 
club with lectures on various scientific subjects, and 
from time to time an evening will be given to the 
reading and discussion of papers prepared by club 
members.
State Registrar Fred H. Caley, of Ohio, has issued 
a statement in which he claims that Ohio has more 
motor cars in operation than any other state in the 
union, with the exception of New York. According 
to the figures announced by Mr. Caley, Ohio has 32,- 
051, a gain of 9,044 over the previous year, while 
Pennsylvania has 30,506, a loss of about 3,845; Massa
chusetts, 28,272, a gain of 4,301 over the previous 
year; New Jersey, 25,520, a gain of 663 over 1909; Illi
nois, 21,081, a gain qf 1,705 over the previous year; 
Michigan, 16,812, a gain of 5,090 over the previous 
year, and Indiana, 9,110, a gain of 2,049 over 1909. 
For the month ending September 30 the report of 
the Ohio department is: Owners registering, 933; 
manufacturers and dealers registering, 17; chauffeurs

Carnegie Technical Schools
A THOUGHTLESS ACT.
Last Thursday morning a crowd of Sophomores 
stood on the walk leading to the Science building. 
Plebes passing to class who did not wear the little 
blue Freshman cap were waylaid and deprived of 
their headgear. All of which may or may not be 
laudable. After a while the Plebes got together and 
charged the Sophs in a body for the purpose of re
covering their confiscated property. All of which 
also may or may not have been right and proper. A 
lively scrap ensued. During the melee a number of 
the contestants jumped out upon the lawn, which was 
soft from the recent rains, and amused themselves 
by rolling each other over the terrace in front of 
the Science building, tearing up considerable portions 
of the grass and sod in the process. All of which 
was decidedly wrong.
The Schools have kept the lawn about the buildings 
in fine condition all year. A great deal of time and 
expense has been put forth to beautify the grounds 
and keep them looking well. The students should 
at least cooperate to the extent of keeping off the 
grass. No doubt the damage was done under the in
fluence of intense excitement and may therefore be 
attributed to thoughtlessness. However, the men 
should be more careful about such things. At this 
time of year it is very difficult to preserve the lawns 
owing to the rains and bad weather. Every fellow 
should recognize this fact and conduct himself a<> 
cordingly, Do not be thoughtless.
A LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR.
T rial.
To the Students:
Last Saturday afternoon I witnessed the foot-ball 
contest between Allegheny College and our own stu
dents. I do not believe I have ever been so deeply 
stirred by such an exhibition of game, clean play as 
that put up by our team, and I want to send to our 
student body a word of encouragement in the face of 
their defeat.
Our team represents for us the chosen athletic 
group in this form of sport and carries their emblem, 
true scholarship and high ideals of sport for sports 
sake, as well as the most representative and best 
players of football.
I wish I could say as much for all the teams with 
whom we have competed this season; then inter
collegiate contests would be more evenly contested 
with victory more often distributed than is now the 
case.
Students, you have a double burden resting on you:
First, To maintain our traditional ideals of honest 
scholarship and clean athletics.
Second, To bear your defeats with fortitude.
I believe the time is approaching when you will be 
able to demonstrate the wisdom and the practicabil
ity of our plan; therefore, keep up your enthusiasm 
and as a student body rally round your classmates 
who are in the fray. Let the team feel that you are 
in sympathy with their efforts and encourage them to 
be steadfast for the right. Thus, and thus only, can 
we do our part to remove from intercollegiate con
tests the stigma which has been atached for many 
years to these contests in the western part of Penn
sylvania. (Signed)
Arthur A. Hamerschlag.
THE SCRUB.
When you watch the team on the field, working 
with machine-like precision, sweeping everything be
fore it, do you ever stop for a moment to consider 
just what makes possible the exhibition of skill and 
daring which thrills you so? Do you ever stop to 
think of the man behind the team?
The scrub is the most important part of a football 
team. Without him, all our elaborately planned 
plays would be useless, our science and skill un
available. It is the work of the scrub which makes 
the team. He is as necessary to its success as wings 
are to a bird; without him no team can exist.
The lot of the scrub is a hard one. He gets all 
the work and very little glory. All week he prac
tices and works faithfully; on Saturday he sits on 
the bench and cheers the team to victorythe team 
he has helped build up. His reward lies only in the 
kncv/ledge that he has done something for his college 
and the hope that he may seme day be a Varsity 
man.
The scrub is a man worth while. Unselfish sacrifice 
is the true mark of nobility. Anyone can work when 
a thousand people are cheering him on; it takes a

---------------------------------------------------

RN* R4>R47
real man to work when he knows no recognition, no 
encouragement.
Therefore, when you talk of heroes and heroic 
deeds, do not forget, in the glare and glamor of great 
deeds, the lowly scrub who is working quietly but 
faithfully for his Alma Mater, the school he loves.
NEW LOCKER ROOMS.
The new locker rooms in the gymnasium were oc
cupied for the first time last .Saturday. The improve
ment is vastly pleasing to both the players and 
coaches. The rooms are large and comfortable; the 
new shower baths are roomy and accessible. The 
principal advantage of the new rooms is to be found 
in the entertainment of visiting teams. Up to the 
present time the dressing rooms have been wholly 
inadequate for our own team; when we had visitors, 
the result was one big jam. All this will be dis
pensed with in the future. There is room for a halfdozen teams in the new rooms and hereafter we will 
be able to afford visiting teams large, comfortable 
quarters.
MANAGER SCOTT ILL.
D. M. Scott, manager of the football team, has been 
lying ill at his home in Connellsville, Pa., for the past 
week. He has been suffering from a nervous break
down. He is recovering rapidly and will probably 
be in school when this paper goes to press. The 
Allegheny game was conducted by the assistant man
agers under the direction of Manager Scott, who 
kept in touch with the team by wire. Scottys 
many friends have missed the hustling, good-natured 
manager and will be glad to see him on the job 
once more.
A FRESHMAN COUP.
The Freshmen won the annual flag rush at the Uni
versity of Cincinnati. A week later, so the story 
goes, the Sophomores got busy and succeeded in con
vincing the innocent ones that college spirit de
manded that every Freshie wear an insignia of his 
lowliness. Accordingly, the Freshmen soon appeared 
in school wearing immense green badges bearing the 
humiliating inscription FRESH.
The Sophs patted each other on the back and com
plimented themselves upon their cleverness. How
ever, one Freshman, endowed with a Yankee eye 
for business turned the joke on the wise-heads in an 
unexpected manner. This fellow got out cards which 
he sold to his classmates for the small sum of five 
cents. In an hour every Freshman had a card pinned 
under his badge. The card read: Freshies won the 
flag-rush and this button shows I took part in the 
rush. Now the Sophomores are trying to show the 
Freshmen just how much the badges detract from the 
good-looks of the man who wears it,

DRAMATIC CLUB MEETING.
A meeting of the Dramatic Club of the M. M. C. S. 
was held on Tuesday afternoon, November the first. 
The meeting was called to order by the chairman, 
Miss Lureta Kempel.
Before the election of officers, a spirited discussion 
took place as to whether the officers of the associa
tion should be chosen exclusively from the senior 
class, or from both senior and junior classes. It 
was at last decided that the precedent established 
last year should be followed, and the officers were 
selected from among the seniors.
The society adopted the play, The Triumph of 
St. Nicholas as its traditional play, to be given every 
year. A second play will probably be given later in 
the year.
The society was honored by the presentation of two 
beautiful silver pins by Miss West. While in Scotland 
this summer Miss West, with her customary thought
fulness, secured the pins as an addition to the cos
tume of the Tartan maid.
Following is the list of dramatic club officers: 
Mary Wight, president; Mary Craighead, secretary 
ancl treasurer; Helen Stewart, stage manager; Mabel 
Toudy and Edna Moorhead, assistants to stage man
ager; Marion Burns, wardrobe mistress; Florence 
Flinn and Elizabeth Lowrie, assistants to wardrobe 
mistress.
What is true and just and honest, 
What is lovely, what is pure,
All of praise that hath admonisht, 
All of virtue, shall endure;
These are themes of poets uses, 
Stirring nobler than the Muses,
Ere Pan was dead.
O brave poets, keep back nothing,
Nor mix falsehood with the whole!
Look up Godward; spread the truth in 
Worthy song from earnest soul:
Hold, in high poetic duty,
Truest Truth the fairest Beauty!
Pan, Pan is dead.
Mrs. Browning.
Miss LyonsWhat do we mean by pasteurized 
milk?
Mary WentzelWhy, I suppose the farmers put 
their cows out to pasture.
Miss Pardoe, punctuating the sentence, I came, I

period.
Helen Baglin and Lily Crosby enjoy dressmaking, 
particularly because they have a ripping good time.

No man is a failure who has done his best.
One noticeable feature of Saturdays rooting was 
the fact that the men cheered strongest and loudest 
when the game was going against us. That is the 
kind of rooting which helps.
The snow is beginning to flitter. Hows your old 
straw hat, anyways ?
There is a long flight of stairs from the field to the 
gymnasium. Climbing is excellent exercise, so the 
Physical Director says.
The Allegheny rooters showed up well at the game 
last Saturday. Our compliments, Meadville!
Many a brave football hero who has moved thou
sands by his matchless daring on the field of con
flict, loses his nerve when confronted by a pretty 
little lady who pouts and stamps her foot.
The fussing season will soon be with us full blast.
Some people say that the Junior Mechanicals are a 
noisy bunch. Oh no! That is just a way they have.
Although ice and snow is with us, some enthusiasts 
still persist in playing tennis.
Trainer Hunter Johnson is official guardian of the 
field. The girls say he is quite efficient in shooing 
unwelcome guests away.
The cold weather doesnt seem to keep the Thistle 
from beginning to sprout.
The holiday we didnt get on Election Day is a 
pretty good excuse for those lab. reports which we 
didnt write up.
What they all say: Just wait until football sea
son is overthen see how I raise my marks!
SOPHOMORE CLASS.
Regarding Caps.
The Plebes, after being twice warned, that it was 
necessary for them to wear their green caps on the 
school grounds, were again relieved of their improper 
headgear last Thursday morning.
The Sophomores have decided that if all the Plebes 
wear their green caps on the school grounds on all 
occasions until Thanksgiving, the confiscated hats 
will be returned, and no more collections will be 
made. It has been heard that some small Plebes 
expect to combat this concession on the part of the 
Sophomores. Remember, there is a tank in the 
foundry.
We all regret that some of our members have 
gotten so much education that their minds have be
come feeble along other lines as is shown by the fol
lowing:

APPLIED INDUSTRIES.
The School of Applied Industries is oiganizing a 
football team. If the teams put out in former years 
by the Industries men are any criterion, this years 
aggregation will be a good one. All three classes of 
the school are pulling for the team, although the 
upper classmen seem inclined to be just a trifle 
backward in putting candidates into the field. This 
should not be. It is the duty of the Uppers to take 
the lead in this thing as they have in the past. Let 
us all get together and boost for a winning team. 
Get out and try to make the team! United, we can 
produce a band of pigskin chasers which will stand 
second to none. Let us get busy.
First Year,
The following students have been elected to hold 
office in the First Year class, Applied Industries: 
President, A. C. Casper; vice president, H. B. Lose; 
secretary, J. G. Camp; treasurer, W. H. Bateman; 
historian, J. J. Rodgers; Tartan representative, E. 
L. Keally.
Emery-Wheel and Buffer.
A new addition to Mr. Taylors department this 
year is an emery-wheel and buffer. The forge-room 
was badly in need of the machine and it is therefore 
a welcome adjunct. The wheels are ingeniously 
placed so as to use the waste energy of the flywheel, 
which is part of the shears. The wheels rest on an 
oak platform which in turn is supported by two iron 
brackets. Energy is transmitted from the fly-wheel 
to the wheels by means of a belt.
Two Old-Timers.
One day last week, a few of the upper classmen 
were surprised to find Messrs. Burns and Dorweiler 
coatless in the forge. It was a treat to watch them 
swing the sledge which they did with great vigor.
There is nothing like taking a little exercise once 
in a while.
To protect graduates from poor investments after

PLEBES WIN FIRST GAME.
As a preliminary to the Tech-Allegheny game, the 
Plebes played the Linden A. C. The final score of 
the game was, Plebes 18Linden 0. Acheson and 
McCusick starred for the Plebes. The former made 
many gains of from 10 to 40 yards around the end 
and through the line, while the latter advanced the 
ball well after receiving forward passes. Maddison 
played a good defensive game. In the second quar
ter, the Plebes received the ball on their own 40-yard 
line. A 40-yard run by Acheson and one of 25 yards 
by McCusick put the ball within striking distance of 
the goal line. From there, several line plunges took 
it over, Balsinger getting the touchdown. Acheson 
kicked goal. 1914 soon got the ball on the 35-yard 
line on a fumble and runs by McCusick and Oakes 
took it over once more. Goal was not kicked.
During the third quarter runs by Acheson and one 
of 30 yards by McCusick put the ball on Lindens 5- 
yard line. Here, however, they fumbled and Linden 
took the ball. Linden then gained 35 yards on an 
onside kick, putting their goal line out of danger for 
the time. About the middle of the last quarter, 
Lewis intercepted a forward pass and carried the 
ball to the 10-yard line. After several line plunges, 
Acheson carried the ball over for the third and last 
touchdown. Acheson failed to kick goal. Just be
fore time was called the Plebes also scored a safety 
which brought the final score up to 18 points. 
Throughout the game, Brine ran the team well and 
used good judgment in his selection of plays.
THISTLE.
Each of the Junior day and night classes should 
elect the three representatives allotted to them on 
the Editorial Board of The Thistle as soon as pos
sible.
It is of the utmost importance that this be done im
mediately as activities will be commenced at an early 
date. The Junior class presidents will kindly give 
this matter their attention. Prompt action will be 
appreciated. H. M. Gousha,
Editor-in-Chief.
The 37inch reflecting telescope for the Uni
versity of Michigan is nearly compelted and will be 
installed very shortly. This will make the Michigan 
observatory one of the finest in the country.

M. E. AND C. E. SOCIETIES JOINT MEETING.
Evolution of the Steam Engine is to be the sub
ject of the lecture by Mr. H. K. Meyer, Saturday, 
Nov. 19th, 1910, before the joint meeting of the 
Mechanical and Civil Societies. Mr. Meyer is at 
present Carnegie Techs Mining Engineer and was 
formerly chief engineer of the Pittsburgh-Buffalo 
Coal Co.
The lecture will be delivered at 9 p. m. in Room 
209, Science Building. Prior to the lecture, from 8 
to 9 p. m., the societies will meet in their respective 
meeting places. After the lecture refreshments and 
smokes will be provided in Room 54 of the Civil 
Department.
A special invitation is extended to all Sophomore 
Mechanicals and Civils.
DISCOURAGED THE DEER.
A visitor at a hotel in the Scotch Highlands, says 
Punch, was asking a gillie as to the prospect of secur

Are there ever any deer about here? he inquired.
Weel, replied the gillie, thoughtfully, there was

Allegheny county, which is practically Greater 
Pitsburgh, is feeling mighty good over its splendid 
showing of good roads, according to the last report 
made by County Road Engineer S. Dj Poster. The 
county has 425 miles of improved highways, the esti
mated cost of which is about $15,000,000. Many of 
these roads are paved with brick, but most of them 
are pike and improved with macadam, amicite and 
asphalt. The roads are all well drained and are 
standing the wear of the thousands of motor cars inv 
a way which proves the thoroughness of the county 
officials in building them. The county bill for re
pairs and building new links is about $1,000,000 per 
year, which is the highest expenditure of this kind 
made by any county in the country except Cook 
county, 111., including Chicago, and Philadelphia coun
ty, Pa., including Philadelphia. The county commis
sions estimate the cost of brick roads at $22,000 per 
quarter and the cost of surfacing old roads with brick
at $12,000 per month. These roads will last 25 years. 
The county has 125 men constantly employed taking 
care of these roads, keeping ditches clean, mowing 
the sides, etc. Every effort is made to avoid acci
dents and in addition to warnings on most bad places 
all over the county the approaches to the bridges are 
painted white, so as to be plainly visible at night.
