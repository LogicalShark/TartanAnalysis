Deans Office Doubles 
For Cupid; Succeeds
The Dean of Mens office provides many services for many peo
ple, but the latest, providing a wife for a student, will not be of
fered to everyone.
Final fulfillment of the contract agreements was made on January 
28, when Elizabeth (Tommy)*  " 
Moses, secretary to the assistant 
dean of men, became Mrs. Ted 
Goodson. It took many trips to the 
Deans office on the part of the ME 
senior before the necessary spec
ial order forms and requisitions 
were filled out in triplicate and 
approved. ,
Mrs. Goodson is the daughter of 
Mr. Frank Moses of the athletic 
department. She is a Carnegie 
Tech graduate and a member of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.
Goodson is present Spring -Car
nival chairman, a member of 
ODK, and a former Student Coun
cil representative. He transferred 
from Baldwin-Wallace college in 
1948, and is a member of Alpha 
Sigma Phi fraternity.
Dottie Stew>art, secretary to Dr.
Dickinson, was the maid of honor, 
and Ed Griffin, ME senior, was the 
best man.
CIT Students Favor 
One-W orld Government
Poll By United World Federalists 
Shows 67% Want U. S, Action Now
If students at Carnegie Institute of Technology are representa
tive, then a surprising majority of the college generation is in favor 
of one-world government.
This was revealed in a poll just completed at Carnegie by the
* campus chapter of United World
Like Gallup ?
M
Though the UWF pollsters 
were definitely biased, their re
sults were not. Undergraduate 
and graduate students and fac
ulty members used recognized 
scientific methods in preparing 
and evaluating the poll ques
tions.
An outstanding feature of the 
poll was the fact that students 
questioned were given both the 
pros and cons of the situations 
presented. The questions asked 
were, for the most part, well 
qualified.  Ed.

Federalists, a national organiza
tion which believes world gov
ernment is the last chance to pre
vent another war.
Results Seem Conclusive
In the poll, 71 percent of the 
Carnegie students questioned said 
they want nations to come to
gether under one government con
sisting of an international legis-- 
lature, police force and system of 
courts.
Almost that many67 percent 
indicated they want this oneworld now. They voted in favor 
of the United States starting im
mediate action to revise the Unit
ed Nations Charter to strengthen 
the UN into a world government.
Asked if they supported the UN, 
90 percent of the students said, 
Yes.
Howeyer, only nine percent said 
that the UN, as it now exists, is 
capable of preserving peace.
Over half of the Carnegie stu
dents proved pessimistic about the 
chances for avoiding a third 
world war in the present situa
tion, and 78 percent either think it 
likely or are certain that A and 
H bombs and other mass 
weapons would be used if another 
war started. These opinions 
seemed to weigh heavily in the 
majority vote for world governMany Opposed
Most of the 21 percent which 
voted against a world federal gov
ernment feel it is impractical. 
Others think that economic and 
other causes for war will have to 
be eliminated before peace can be 
had; they dont think a world 
legislature could cure these ills.
Opinions as to whether Russia 
would join a world federation are 
more widely scattered. The largest 
numberbut less than halfof 
the students think it unlikely that 
the Soviet would join. Six percent 
feel certain she would, 30 percent 
think it likely, and 17 percent are 
undecided.

Editorials
Nice, But...
Seventy-one percent of the student body want 
9 world govenment. At least, that was the figure 
arrived at in the recent United World Federalists 
poll. Frankly, wre doubt that the results of the 
poll connote the same tendencies as those which 
UWF would like to believe.
The poll may be fair indication of student 
opinion all over the country, but it certainly 
does not represent the desires of older, and 
more experienced, generations. Experience in 
the world does not necessarily lead to correct 
conclusion on the subject; rather, it leads to 
prejudices which hinder fair evaluation of such 
a proposal as world government. This pre
mise leads to the conclusion that a world gov
ernment will only be established if the present 
college generation and its successors do the 
major portion of the torch carrying necessary 
to promote such an organization.
The results of the poll might be construed as 
an indication that the students voting yes to the 
question Should there be a world government? 
are ready to go out in the world and preach its 
gospel. We are positive this view is much too 
cpt'mistic.
The only valid conclusion that can be reached 
is that, after reading statements presenting the 
pros and cons of world government, a large ma
jority of students favor the idea. However, many 
times an idea is rejected because the means 
necessary to the end are not approved. The means 
to establish a world government were not pre
sented for approval in this poll, probably be
cause neither the UWF nor anyone else has ever 
formulated a feasible plan.
Ilere is where we wish to interject a pes
simistic note. We have no assurance from the 
poll that a feasible plan that is, one that will 
not present more problems that it solves, will 
ever be found. A poll of greater consequence 
would be one that would disclose how many 
students are willing to devote themselves to 
constructing the means of solution. Perhaps 
the membership rolls of the UWF is a measure 
of that quantity.
Small Problem
Last week the results of the Undergraduate 
Advisory Committees survey concerning ab
sences before and after vacations were announced. 
Tne all school average for the day before vaca
tions was found to be ten percent, twice as high 
as is normal on week days and approximately 
as high as is normal cn Saturdays.
We do not believe that any member of the 
faculty considers ten percent absence a prob
lem. In most classes, it should not hinder the 
presentation of the subject nor the understand
ing of it by the students who are present. It 
is conceivable however, that a much higher 
level of absences would be determintal to both 
instructor and student. It should also be re
membered that the figure reported is only an 
average and the percentage of absences in cer
tain classes was much higher. Thus a problem 
does exist in isolated cases.
The cause of the prooiem can be divided be
tween the lack of responsibility of the student and 
the low, actual or apparent, value of the course. 
Since the high absence rates were found in only 
s few classes, it appears to us that the latter 
cause is the one more responsible for the results.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
"53 Officers Answer 
Tartan Editorial
Editor, the Tartan:
In reply to the apparent injustice done to us 
in the Tartan, February 14, titled Onions, the 
officers of the Class of 53 would like to present 
our side of the story.
First, we would like to thank all those who 
helped in the initial organization of our class. 
From the start they gave us we have been able 
to step ahead and assume some responsibilities 
from such overworked organizations as the Cwens 
and Scimitars. Our first assignment from them 
was to take over the traditions examination. Each 
member of the class who had failed to take the 
test was personally contacted, a re-test given and 
a fine imposed.
Elections were held in each department to 
select representatives in the class organization to 
act as an advisory board. This board will prove 
a valable asset to the faculty and Student Council 
facilitating direct contact with the students in 
our class.
At present we are planning a project to get 
the class better acquainted, to provide entertain
ment, and to start building a treasury for future
years.
In view of the success of our class organization 
we wish to urge other classes, both those at Car
negie Tech now and in years to come, to use this 
method of a well-planned class organization to 
link the faculty and students in a closer and more 
satisfactory union.
Sincerely yours,

Tomorrow night should be one that will go down in Car
negie sport history as one of the most significant and memor
able ones in the last decade.
The evening' marks the close of the home portion of 
the most successful basketball season here since 1938 and 
with it the final performances of some of the greatest 
athletes ever to wear the Plaid.
What more fitting opponent than the now win hungry 
Pitl Panthers could have been chosen for such a closing? The 
Panthers have already felt the sting of the Tartans this year. 
This feat alone makes any Carnegie season a success regardless 
of the other developments. But the sudden impotence of the 
Plaid offense might well write an unhappy ending to the story 
which would provide a perfect analogy with the most recent 
gridiron campaign.
Perhaps the most remarkable fact 
about tomorrow's proceedings, however, 
is that three of Carnegies floor stars 
will bow out of the local scene with this 
one last performance. "f '_r
Most sorely missed of these men gpl r#' | . ^ gif
when the Sctos step back onto the flyl| ftl
Skibo gymnasium floor again next
fall will be the inimitable Jack MSB
Riehl. Known as a hustler among |PPf fjjjii
school star has taken over the brunt V
of the scoring chores this year in jaCk Riehl
addition to his play making.
With his name now heading the scoring column, Riehl.sud
denly has found himself a marked man and the topic of most 
discussions about the Plaids new rise to hardwood heights, 
lie is even more closely watched now than in past years, al
though opposing coaches became aware of the threat he pre
sented long ago.
Duquesne followers were high in their praise of the senior 
guard. Ilere, they were convinced, was the cog which the 
equally amazing Mel Cratsley had needed to put the finishing 
touches to his winner.
It was Riehl who stepped in to fill 
the gap when the Tartans found their 
crack pivot man, Mike Theodore, losing 
his scoring punch. Since that time it has 
been Riehl who has been the driving 
force behind the successful season. 
Theodore, whose name has been 
almost synonymous with basketball 
at Carnegie over the past four years, 
will join Riehl in the bow out.
Here will be the close of one of the 
most colorful athletic careers in Carne
gie annals. To be sure; the Plaid cap
tain has not displayed the form recently with which*his fol
lowers had become accustomed, but he has always been a vital 
part of the local offense.
Only for one brief period, when he and his teammates cut 
down Pitt and Penn State within a span of 48 hours, did the 
Tartan hardwood great flash his old style of play. The change 
this evoked in the team as a whole is self evident in the results 
it produced.
Theodores defensive ability, obscured previously by his 
offensive prowess, has come to light due to the change in matances of the recent contests, howlIlM
ever, are owned by 20 year old Joe 99k ||lfl
Matsey. Matsey saw little action %
until last year, and now, with his
collegiate career rapidly drawing to joe Matsey
a close, he is pushing to the front.
Starting with his great game against Duquesne, the push 
shot expert soon caught the fancy of the discouraged Tartan 
fins and began to draw cries of We want Matsey in last
Saturdays clash with Washington and Jefferson.

Tartan Cagers Swamp Thiel 
For Tenth Victory, 71 to 58
Carnegie Techs Tartan floormen showed signs of returning to 
pre-vacation form last Wednesday evening as they overpowered Thiel 
College by a 71-58 margin. The visiting Plaid hoopsters piled-up a 
sizeable first-half advantage and then coasted the rest of the way.
Hes Riehl Good 
Guards Jack Riehl and Tom Beck paced the Carnegie attack,
each notching 16 points on seven ?------------------------------------------------------
fielders and a brace of fouls. For
wards Tom Craig and Len Bianchi 
accounted for ten points apiece, 
counting four times from the field 
and twice from the free-throw 
line.
High-point honors for the even
ing, however, went to Riley, 
mammoth Thiel guard, who col
lected 22 points, eighteen of them 
in the second half.SThe host team managed to keep 
within range of the Tartans dur
ing the first period, trailing by 
only 12-9 at the end of the stanza.
Craig and Beck, with five markers 
apiece, were largely responsible 
for the Plaid lead.
Half Told Tale
However, the second quarter 
saw the visitors hit for 22 points 
and gain a commanding 34-17 
halftime lead. The Thiel 
were unable to match the 
of Riehl and Bianchi, who 
netted three fielders.
Although Thiel outscored the 
-Plaid in the second half, 41 to 37, 
largely through Rileys sharpshooting, Carnegies early advan
tage proved to be too much of an 
obstacle to overcome.
Plaid Faces Panthers 
In Final Home Game
*rMel Cratsley and his current edition of the Carnegie Tech cagers 
will close out the home section of the 1949-50 season tomorrow night y 
when they play host to the clawless Panthers of Pitt.
Three Tartan basketball stars, Jack Riehl, Mike Theodore, and 
_ ? joe Matsey, will make their final
appearances at the Skibo gym as 
the Plaid goes out after its elev
enth win of the campaign and its 
second over their Oakland rivals. 
Trust The Records?
The Plaid will be matching their 
10 and 8 record against a com
paratively weak 3-12 mark owned  
by Dr. H. C. CarlsonsPanthers. 1 
Slight underdogs in their first 
meeting, the Tartans figure to be 
top heavy favorites when they an
swer the opening whistle tomor
row evening.
In their first meeting of the year 
on the stadium pavilion, the Pan
thers found Carnegies four man 
zone defense with a floating pivot 
impenetrable. Forced to take the 
majority of their shots from out-4 
side the foul circle, the host team 
were no match for the fast break
ing Plaid team and dropped a 20 
point decision.
This, the 78th meeting of the 
teams, will mark another step in 
the longest rivalry in Carnegie 
hardwood history. In direct con
trast, the Tartans visit Indiana 
State Teachers college at Indiana, 
Pa., on Saturday in a contest that , 
will bring to life a new basketball 
series.
Favored Again
The Teachers have had little 
luck this year despite their con
sistent Class B competition, and 
once again the Scots should enter 
the battle as distinct favorites.
Two more games remain on the 
local schedule following this week. 
Visits to Grove City and West
minster next Wednesday and SatJ 
urday respectively will wind up 
the season. Cratsleys proteges 
own a victory over the Grovers 
but took a drubbing from the Ti
tans on the local floor early in the 
season.

Carnegie Mermen Top 
Westminster, Lose Two
Demas, Kramer Star For Tartans; 
Wash-Jeff9 Oberlin Here This Week
TAMAN
After a week which saw the Carnegie swimming team compete 
in three meets, Coach Sofields mermen have a season record of 
two wins and three losses to build on for the remainder of the sea
son. ?-----------------------------------------------------
But one of those meets in the 
last week saw the definite under
dog Tartans upset the powerful 
Westminster team, which has 
reigned over the Plaid in the last 
few seasons of competition. Be
hind after the opening event, the 
medley relay, the swimmers pulled 
ahead to win going away by the 
score of 47-28.
Neptunes Boy
A double win by Nick Demas in 
the 50 and 100 yard free style 
events gave the team ten points 
towards the total. He also an
chored the winning free style re
lay team of Tom Freeman, Dick 
Kramer, and Tom Astle to victory 
in the final event of the meet.
Kramer scored a win in the 220 
yard free style before swimming 
on the relay. A1 Macy completed 
the sweep of the free style first 
places with a victory in the 440 
yard event. Weddell copped the 
150 yard backstroke to finish the 
victories for the afternoon.
Beck and Evans took first and 
second in the diving events to add 
eight points to the swimmers 
scores.
Rough Going
Going on the road for the first 
time this season, the team met

be held at the local pool on 
Wednesday, March 1, at 4:00

each time.
On Friday Kent State was the 
host and winner by a score of 49- 
17. The visitors were unable to 
garner a single first place, but 
captured most of the second places 
in very close races.
Continuing on to Cleveland Sat
urday, the team met nationally 
ranked Fenn College and lost by 
the score of 47-28. Nick Demas 
copped another first in the 50 yard 
sprint and Dick Kramer took first

Emanon moved one point ahead 
of Kappa Sigma in the Spares 
bowling league by scoring a 4-0 
victory over Tau Delta Phi last 
week. The Kappa Sigs dropped a 
point to the Phi Kaps in their 
match and thus broke the 16-16 
first place tie with .Emanon of the 
previous week. The Emanon ag
gregation tallied 2574 points with 
a low game of 876 against the Tau 
Delts.
Sigma Nu swept to a 4-0 win 
over Citcom and moved ahead in 
the Strikes league. The Sigma

Carnegie Techs faltering floor 
five proved to be no match for 
an aggressive Washington and Jef
ferson College quintet last Satur
day night as the visiting Jaymen 
rolled to an easy 54-35 victory 
over the hapless Tartans.
The defeat was the eighth of the 
for the Plaid as against 
wins. Also, it marked the fifth 
setback in the last seven starts for 
the Skibos, a complete reversal 
of form from that displayed in 
the early part of the season.
Eaton Ate Em Up
Center Jack Eaton was the key 
man in the lopsided W&J vic
tory, the Presidents second over 
the Plaid this season, as the 65" 
pivotman meshed 18 points and 
performed superbly under the 
boards. Jack Riehl again led the 
Tartan point-makers, collecting 10 
markers.
Not only were the smaller Ski
bos unable to rebound effectively, 
but they also displayed their poor
est marksmanship of the season. 
It was the first game this year in 
which the Plaid was unable to 
tally at least 40 points. ,
Quick Lead
With Eaton collecting eight 
points, the Prexies gained a 9-1 
advantage after six minutes of the 
first quarter. Carnegie narrowed 
the gap to 11-6 by the end of the 
period but the Red and Black con
tinued the torrid pace to increase 
the margin to 25-14 at halftime.
After the intermission the visi
tors really iced the decision. While 
holding the Tartans scoreless the 
Presidents netted 10 points in 
rapid succession and went on to 
pile up a 40-19 lead at the end 
of the third stanza.
The Jaymen wrere content to 
coast the rest of the way, with the 
second and third platoons playing 
most of the final period.
Architects, Dukes Win, 
Hold IM League Lead
The race for the American league championship in Intramural 
Basketball saw the Sigma Nu No. 1 five experience their first de
feat before the Architects on Thursday night. Trailing at the end 
of the first quarter, the hard figting Sigma Nus outscored the Archi------------------------------------------------?tects in the second quarter to take

In the Federal league ASCE lost

iods, ASCE moved within one 
point of the Dukes. Unable to 
overcome this point deficit in the 
final period ASCE lost 38-37 and 
the Dukes retained their league 
lead.
Beta Theta Pi and the Kappa 
Sigs managed to maintain their tie 
for first place in the National

victory over FPHA 53-32 and the

lied 11 points, the Obelisks took 
the lead 35-32 at the end of the 
third period.
Kappa Sigs overcame this lead 
in the last quarter to tie the score 
47-47 as the time ran out. In the

field goal to give the Kappa Sigs

A Mystery Solved
Old Jim A Real Horse
By Joe Weinreich
Drama School 
Presents Comedy 
By Garcia Lorca
Last week, this writer promised an explanation of the meaning 
of OLD JIM. Here, then, is the story . . . Old Jim was a real horse.
He was very much a part of the life of a young boy who lived 
on a farm in Clay County, Illinois.
The painting exaggerated noth-? 
ing, for according to Dr. Doherty, a ... as I walked toward
Old Jim was . . . the ugliest 
(horse) that ever came down a 
pike. His head was enormous, and
the depot on my way to college. 
He died while I was away. Fun
niest thing about Old Jim is that
in the middle of it were set two hes still standing up. And the heck 
of the most huge and human eyes j ^ *s> s been dead for over 
ever seen on an animal. The neck ! years.
. . . stretched back to connect 
with two long fore-legs, which, in 
turn, ended in two of the biggest 
hoofs this side of Peoria. All this 
is faithfully reproduced in the 
painting.
Was It Real(?)
His hind hoofs were big too, 
but the legs weren't. They were 
only about half as long as the 
fore limbs. Old Jims body wasn't 
a body. It was a set of ribs with 
a minor mountain range running 
down the top. (This gets better 
and better.) [We hope so.Ed.]
The strange gait is apparently 
true to life, for, he'd bring both 
left legs forward, then both right 
legs, and off hed go wriggling 
down the road. (Imagine!)
Green Corn
Old Jim was lazy, ornery, narrow-minded, and perpetually hun
gry. Once, he got into the corn
field and tried to eat his way 
through the green corn. (The 
rascal.)
The last Dr. Doherty ever saw 
of Old Jim, he was standing in
Boots On?
It seems that the day Old Jim 
was to be buried was a scorcher. 
The three men who had the job 
to do were faced with several 
feet of the hard soil that gives 
Clay County its name.
Noah, one of the three, came up ] 
with a sensible work-saving idea: 
bury Old Jim standing up. And 
that is what they did. They got a 
fence-post digger, used it properly, 
and put poor Old Jim away for 
good . . . standing up.
Defied Imagination
After hearing this . . . this inter
esting tale it became clear to me 
what Dr. Doherty was doing. Poor 
man, he was trying to put on can
vas an exact replica of a creature 
that defied imagination. (Jeff, our 
farmer friend of last week, swal
lowed his Mail Pouch when he 
learned of the truth.)
Additional research has shed 
more light on Dr. Doherty, the 
dauber. In 1944 one of his oil 
paintings (SELF PORTRAIT)
World Wide photo
PRESIDENT DOHERTY AND FRIEND
Dr. Dohertys painting, Self Portrait, (shown above) won a 
first in oils in 1944.
won the Associated Artists of 
Pittsburghs first prize. Last month 
ten of his oils were exhibited at 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse.
There must be something to
painting as a nobt>y. Winston 
Churchill does it too. "He says, 
Painting is a companion with 
whom one may hope to walk a 
great part of lifes journey.
The Shoemakers Prodigious 
Wife, by Garcia Lorca, will be 
presented by the drama depart
ment February 23 through March 
3. Directed by Sydney Spayde, the 
play centers around the marital 
problems of an old shoemaker and 
his young wife living in a small 
village in Spain. Village gossip 
further intensifies their obvious 
marriage complications, and the 
plot consists of solving these prob
lems.
The Shoemakers Prodigious 
Wife is the most popular of Lor
cas farces. This production will be 
staged in the arena style: bleach
ers will be placed back-stage, and 
the action will take place on a 
raised platform in the center of 
the audience, Although Tech has 
given informal presentations be
fore, this is the first full-scale pro
duction of this kind.

Introverts?
While attendance at Evening School social functions has been 
satisfactory, there is not the response that should be in evidence con
sidering an enrollment of nearly twelve hundred students.
Strangely enough, one usually sees the same group supporting 
all the socials. If these people did not have a good time at these 
affairs they would not continue to give them their support. This is 
proof enough that at least a portion of the student body enjoys going 
to dances, swim parties, and picnics.
Why dont the other eleven hundred students attend Evening 
School functions? Your editor found a variety of reasons on his 
rounds of the school halls while trying to sell tickets to the current 
dances. Reasons for not availing themselves of an opportunity to 
mingle with their fellow students in pleasant social contact vary 
from such remarks as, What dance, Im tired, Im busy, and I 
would rather see television.
For the benefit of the television fans we might say that they 
should go to a square dancethat is real wrestling. To the others 
we say, what are you going to Carnegie Tech for? A true educa
tion is not all book learning, one must also have the contacts and 
friends who know and can boost you in your profession. Friends 
made here at Carnegie Tech can prove to be invaluable assets. Being 
an introvert or a hermit will never get you anywhere. Wake up 
and live!
Evening Council Holds Dance; 
First Semi-Formal Since War
DU Orchestra To Furnish Music March 18th 
As Girls Get Chance To Wear Them Long
On Saturday evening, March 18, Evening Student Council will
sponsor the first semi-formal dance to be held on the Carnegie Tech
evening campus since before World War II.
Once again Council is calling upon the CIT Delta Upsilon orches" *tra to furnish the music. This or
ganization furnished danceable 
music for the 1948 Thanksgiving 
dance, and from all reports fav
orable improvements have in
creased their quality.
There have been requests from 
members of the evening student 
body that a semi-formal dance be 
held on campus. In an attempt 
to satisfy every member of the 
student body at least once, Even
ing Student Council is taking on 
the task of sponsoring this dance.
It can be a success if it is given 
the full support it deserves by a 
student body that has yet to sup
port a dance in an outstanding 
fashion. Evening Student Coun
cil will be everlastingly grateful 
if the student body turns out for 
this dance and proves once and 
for all that there is still some CIT 
spirit left.
News
And
Views
At registration the other even
ing some of the fellows were won
dering what happened to all of 
the pretty girls that register for 
evening classes. It seems the en
gineers never got a chance to see 
them again after registration 
nigfci. A solution might be for 
these girls to come out to partici
pate in Evening School activities. 
Beauty should not be hidden even 
on the Evening School campus.
Now that we can spell Speleogical, we can mention that W. 
R. (Will) Schnarrenberger, presi
dent of the Pittsburgh Grotto of 
the National Speleological So
ciety, gave a lecture on Local 
Pennsylvania Caves to the young 
peoples society of a Pittsburgh 
church. The talk was supplement
ed by excellent color-slides. Will 
has been a member of Evening 
Student Council for the past three 
years.
Bob Ellstrom, Plaid co-editor, 
.elebrated his birthday at the 
council square dance Saturday 
evening, February 18th. Bob in
sists on keeping his age a secret 
we wonder why.
Incidentally, if any of the even
ing students havent as yet visited 
the book store in the basement of 
Administration Hall, dont hesitate 
to make this excursion a must on 
your list of musts, for it is truly 
in the latest style. It is possible 
to purchase any kind of book
from a 25 cent novel to the most 
profound text.
James Frape, Evening Student 
Council member, again makes the 
news. Jim not only wen a first 
prize in jewelry design at the 
fortieth annual exhibition of the 
Pittsbui'gh Associated Artists, but 
he also was elected treasurer of 
this group. This years exhibition 
is held in the third floor galler
ies of the Carnegie Institute. The 
public is welcome.
Phi Gamma Pi sorority sponsor
ed a card party Saturday, Febru
ary 18 in Rosenbaums tearoom. 
This affair was held for the bene
fit of a scholarship id which is 
the sororitys aim. The party was 
a success, and the girls are already 
planning another such affair in the 
near future.
Evening Enrollment Declines
The most recent announcement 
on evening student registration 
shows that the enrollment for the 
second semester of the school year 
is larger than the enrollment for 
the second semester of the 1948- 
49 school year.
The school of Engineering and 
Science experienced the largest 
increase with an enrollment of 861 
compared with 800 in the previous 
year. Margaret Morrison increased 
its enrollment from 3 to 8. The 
schools of Arts and H&SS suffered
decreases from 260 to 232 and 
from 61 to 43 respectively. The 
total registration is smaller than 
the total for the first semester 
The total indicates that the reg
istration is approaching a point 
of stability that is far below the 
totals of approximately 4000 stu
dents which Evening School en
rolled in the past.
