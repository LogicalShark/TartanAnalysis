Klausing Named Head Coach
by Elly Zimmerman
I
. i
Football at CMU may never be the 
same again. Chuck Klausing, the assistant 
head football coach at Western Virginia 
University, was named as CMUs new Headi 
Football Coach, on Tuesday.
In regard to Klausings recent appoint
ment President Cyert stated,The univer
sity is determined to match its academic; 
excellence with athletic excellence. Later^ 
Cyert commented,It is not good to have 
students engaging in athletics with the 
attitude that theyre going to lose. As 
years go on, the students and alumni are 
going to be proud of what were doing 
now, Cyert added.
Klausing will be the highest paid coach 
in CMU history which indicates that 
winning at all costs may be the new philos
ophy of the University. Both of these 
men [Cyert and Banner] are looking for a 
coach thats a winner, Klausing stated.
The University has had to make some 
sacrifices to fulfill these winning ambitions. 
This year alone, the athletic director re
signed along with the wrestling coach. To 
complete the exodus, the basketball and 
football coaches were dismissed.
These rather sudden changes have beeii 
the basis for rumors circulating that CMU 
is going big time. Cyerts comment on this 
was,It does not mean we will be playing 
big time football or basketball. He stated 
further,We dont want to get into a posi
tion where were buying players. Big time 
may not be on Cyerts mind but Klausing 
said,My immediate goals are to get com
petitive in the PACs. My long-range goals
are possibly to win a national champion
ship.
For the past six seasons, Klausing was 
the assistant head football coach at West 
Virginia University. His duties included 
recruiting as well as being the teams de
fensive coordinator. WVUs 5-3 defense 
was responsible for the 17-14 upset victory 
over Pitts option offense this season.
Football today is defensive, 
Klausing stated. When asked what type of 
strategy he plans on employing at CMU he 
said,We will build from the defense first.
Klausings immediate responsibilities 
will be to interview the present coaching 
staff of three full-time assistants; Dennis 
Morabito, Bill Englert, and Jim Young
blood, and two part-time coaches, to see if 
any of them will be staying on. I want to 
get to know the people on the staff and 
give them every opportunity possible, 
Klausing stated. He also mentioned that he 
wants to meet the young men on the foot
ball team here.
Klausings coaching career began in 
Pitcarin, Pennsylvania only a tew mJes 
from Pittsburgh. Over a five year period, 
he led Pitcarin to a record of 30-7-1. His 
success at Braddock High was even more 
impressive. In six years he compiled a 
record of 55 wins, 0 losses and six WPIAL 
titles.
After a year of coaching at Rutgers 
in 1960, he became an assistant to Paul 
Dietzel at West Point. Klausing returned 
to head coaching at Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania where he stayed for six sea
sons. IUPs record was 47-10 during this 
period.
From Indiana it was on to WVU where 
he assisted Bobby Bowden, the Head 
Coach. Their teams overall record was 43- 
26.
Klausing can be classified at nothing 
less than a winner. Recruiting will be one 
of his major attributes since he is familiar 
with area high school coaches. He will 
begin recruiting immediatly but will con
tinue to work with the Mountaineers to
Chuck Klausing, the new Head Football Coach
prepare for their December 31st appear
ance in the Peach Bowl against North 
Carolina State.
I want to be a football coach for the 
rest of my life, Klausing said.
SDC Turns Down Married Students
by Debbie Rosenkrantz
Priorities and suggestions for hous
ing policies to alleviate next years expect
ed housing shortage were discussed at a 
forum sponsored by SDC aijd attended by 
SDC members and officers, Dean Williams 
of Residence Life, Dean Swank of Student 
Affairs, Steve Zalewski of Campus Services, 
and about 100 students, on Sunday night 
at 7:00 p.m.
Doherty married students had a list 
of five reccommendations concerning 
housing. The first suggestion changed the 
order of changes to be made to increase 
housing to a) putting students in staff 
housing (some of which is currently being 
used by University of Pittsburgh profes
sors.) b) increasing coop capacity by minor 
renovations c) reevaluate normal occu
pancy and lastly d) convert parts of Do
herty to undergraduate housing. (The CamPres. Cyert Foils Robbery Attempt
by Elly Zimmerman
Walking up five flights of stairs to his 
office everyday enabled President Cyert to 
foil an attempted robbery last Mondky 
night.
Dr. and Mrs. Cyert were attending 
CMUs opening basketball game againjst 
St. Vincent on Monday. After the game, 
at approximately 10:30 pm, the President 
and his wife left the gymnasium and began 
walking to their car, which was parked 
behind securitys office on Frew Street. 
Neither Mrs. Cyert, who had her puree 
under her arm, or Dr. Cyert noticed the 
two young black males walking behind 
them.
Suddenly one of the young men hit 
Mrs. Cyerts purse out from under her arin.

reaction. The scream caught her husbands 
attention. In recalling the incident I>.Mech. E. Dept. Robbed
by Laurie Trask
Over Thanksgiving vacation, equip
ment for a mechanical engineering project 
was stolen from Hammerschlag Hall. The 
equipment , which included three radios 
and three keyboards, had a total value of 
$1400. Its a continously growing prob
lem and its hard to continue any sort of 
work here, complained Fritz Faulhaber, 
the victim of the latest robbery.
The eqipment stolen was part of a 
project called Dial-a-Ride. Faulhaber ex
plained, Ive been working on this project 
for two and a half years... Its for automat
ically dispatching taxis and calculating 
fares. We really need the stuff back. Should 
it appear suddenly, we wont mind. 
Dial-a-Ride had been sponsored by 
a government grant. As a result of the 
theft, according to Faulhaber, the FBI 
must be called in on the case. He also indi
cated that the Pittsburgh Police are already 
investigating the matter. However, Mike 
Corletti, director of Security commented 
to the Tartan that the theft had not been 
reported to C-MU Security. There are no 
real leads yet, but Faulhaber believes, 
it must be someone who is familiar with 
commercial two-ways. lem
Cyert said, I heard sort of a poppmg sound 
when the purse was hit, and turned to see 
the purse flying in the air. Immediately 
the purse was grabbed by the young man 
and he and his friend began running down 
Frew Street toward Hunt Library. Dr. 
Cyert reacted by pursuing his assailants.
During the pursuit, the trio approached 
Baker Hall. As they began to pass the 
building, Dr. Cyert ran in to get securitys 
assistance. After informing security of the 
incident he went back outside only to find 
that the young men had changed direc
tions. The pursuit began again. Finally, 
one of the young men threw the purse at 
President Cyert.
By this time security had entered the 
picture. Eventually the thieves disap
peared into Panther Hollow.

pus Services Board listed this as the first 
way to increase capacity.) The second 
suggestion was to convert one or two 
wings of Doherty to housing specifically 
for undergrads. (Preasently, both marrieds 
and singles live in each building.) Thirdly, 
they propose that the University locate and 
lease housing ihat is appropiate for stu
dents use. This housing space could then 
be sublet to students. This would eliminate 
the problem that students have finding 
nine month leases. The fourth proposal was 
that the University assist students on an in
dividual basis and compensate them for 
any increased cost. They find the opening 
of an off-campus housing office the least 
desirable suggestion because they feel that 
they are generally inefficient.
Other suggestions made were to de
crease the size of next years freshman 
class. However, Dean Swank commented 
that in the past, housing has never limited 
admissions. General applause were heard 
when someone pointed out that the first

for second place.
The contest was devised and run by 
R. F. Duck, A1 Vecchi, David Wolf, and
the RA staff in conjunction with S.A. and 
U.F.O. This committee was also helped by 
Sue Christian and Mary Ann Patross. This 
is the first year of an annual event which 
will become a part of student life and grow 
and prosper throughout the years. stated 
A1 Vecchi. The purpose of the contest was 
to have student involvement get the 
campus into a seasonal atmosphere.

Inflation and Total Freedom 
Editor:
Rick Costa stated in .his 
article that the only satisfac
tory cure for inflation would be 
for man to establish a sense of 
group solidarity which still al
lows him a meaningful measure 
of freedom. I, unlike Mr. Costa, 
do not pretend to know a cure 
for inflation, but I do know that 
his reasoning is illogical.
First of all, there is but one 
meaningful freedom: total. Any
thing else is contradictory. With 
total freedom there is no group 
solidarity other than the sense 
of unity between all persons 
who know that they are totally 
free. In a totally free society 
you cannot establish a sense 
of group solidarity for two rea
sons. The first is simple. Anyone 
not wishing to be part of the
unity immediately has his indi
vidual rights violated. Therefore, 
he is not free. Secondly, in a 
group you must deal with the 
imaginary animals called group 
rights. Group rights are imagin
ary because groups are imagin
ary. Also individual rights must 
be maintained or chaos results: 
no one has to worry about their 
own competency because 
theyre not seen as an individual, 
only as part of a group. This is 
an invitation for apathy.
Costa also gives us two main 
causes for the current inflation. 
The first cause, says Costa, is 
the ability of large companies 
to manipulate prices. Why 
someone should feel that a com
pany cannot sell its products 
(its private property!) for any 
price it chooses is a mystery to 
me. Consider it from an alter
nate viewpoint. If you were 
selling your car is it not reason
able that you should be allowed 
to make the largest profit pos
sible? Would you sell your car 
for a loss because you feel it 
is good for the economy or be
cause you feel that it is morally 
right? It is not the capitialism 
that is failing. The advantages of 
capitalism are being choked by 
the liberal laws of the 60s, most 
notably the Civil Rights Act of 
1964.' Capitalism cannot thrive 
in the presence of these laws.
His second cause for inflation 
is the selfishness and greed of' 
the American consumer. He fails 
to recognize that every person 
on the globe is selfish, and there 
is nothing wrong with it. The 
most benevolent churchman is 
selfish, his goal either being his 
own salvation or the good 
feelings he attains when he feels 
that hes saved someone else, 
claim something as innate as

Freshman - MIS
Apathy in Buggy!
Editor:
I am writing in reference to 
the letter appearing in the Nov. 
18 TARTAN by LSDC, the gen
tleman who finds the lack of en
thusiasm for buggy a mystery. 
Apathy is a serious problem in 
buggy. Indeed, this is the main 
reason that SDC has only four 
drivers wanting to drive the one 
available buggy. Apathy was a 
key factor in SDCs decision to 
increase funds for this years 
buggy committee. The fact that 
Kathy wishes to freeroll again 
is due solely to apathy. Finally, 
the whole reason as to why SDC 
took an unsafe buggy onto the 
course that morning was the re
sult of apathy toward winning 
by the largest buggy committee 
SDC has had in some time.
I must now discuss LSDCs 
view of the accident. Here, it 
seems, you have missed a few 
minor points. True, Kathy was 
inexperienced - unfortunately, 
thats how most drivers start. 
One point that you missed was 
the condition of the buggy. 
Since we started this year minus 
last years buggy (we didnt own 
it), we were forced to turn a 
piece of scrap metal with four 
wheels into a buggy. On the 
Sunday in question, there was a 
problem with the steering - it 
seems that the usual lack of 
control had suddenly become no 
control. We found that this was 
due to poor workmanship on the 
night before and to general 
loosening of nuts and bolts.
For those who do not know, 
I must state that I drove the 
buggy in question quite often
last year. This year, I am always 
the first to go down the hill on 
the Sundays that we run. I 
have had so much experience at 
driving that buggy that I feel I 
am no longer learning anything 
for freerolls. Yet, as well as I 
can drive that buggy, on that 
particular morning it was all I 
could do just to keep it between 
the curbs. It seemed I had no 
control at all and I recommend
ed we not freeroll again that 
day. However, we tightened a 
few nuts and I rolled once more. 
Unfortunately, the desire to win 
now clouded the sense of reason 
and I allowed the buggy to roll 
that day. Since I helped to make 
the steering changes the night 
before, and I allowed the buggy 
to roll that day, I must place 
the entire blame for the accident 
upon myself. I knew that it 
was unsafe, yet I did not stop 
the buggy from freerolling. It 
was truly unfortunate that 
someone else suffered because of 
my mistake. I vow not to let 
such an incident happen again.

Inexperienced & Going Strong 
Editor:
I am writing in response to 
L.S.D.C.s Buggy article in the 
Nov. 18 TARTAN. I am current
ly working on a buggy for an 
organization (S.D.C.) other than 
the only two that he said ap
pear genuinely interested this 
year and their freeroll times 
reflect this. I will admit that 
our buggy is not one of the fast
er buggies as of now but I dis
agree that our organization is un
interested or apathetic. We are 
working very hard and have been 
anxiously awaiting the last four 
scheduled freerolls. The enthusi
asm in our organization is ap
parent to most of the people
in it. Simply because we do not 
have the experience of the or
ganizations mentioned and are 
not yet as fast as they, does not 
reflect on our interest in winning 
the Sweepstakes this year. I 
agree that more gorganizations 
should be freerolling but I still 
consider the general tone of the 
article to be unfair.
If S.D.C. doest win this 
year, it wont be because we 
didnt try.Frank Worbs 
CMU Fight Song Revisited
Editor:
Changes were necessary and 
with apologies to the author 
the following is my revision of 
the original lyric. It is thought 
that students might care to learn 
the words so that they can sing 
along on appropriate occasions.
FIGHT SONG 
Fight, Tartans, of CarnegieMellon;
Fight for the glory of the clan. 
Let your eyes be ever on the 
Tartan bright;
As we stand united, every man 
fight, fight, fight.
Fight every loyal son of Skibo; 
Fight till we win the victory,
The Kilties are coming, 
hurray, hurray!
The Kilties are coming,
Theyll win today;
For theyre fighting, fighting 
for Carnegie-Mellon.

A Strategy for the University
View From Warner Hall
From time to time in writing and talking, I have discussed the con
cept of a strategy for the University. This concept is difficult to state in 
a form that is easy to understand and as a result my remarks are some
times misinterpreted.
A university of our size and limited resources must develop programs 
that build upon advantages already existing here. Only in a few specific 
areas can we afford to attain excellence by developing traditional pro
grams. I like to use as an example the thinking that went on when GSIA 
was being formed in 1949. Many people wanted us to use the case 
method of teaching like the Harvard Business School and to model our 
curriculum after Harvards. We rejected this idea because we felt that 
another such school was not needed. We also recognized that the best 
we could ever be was second, for it would be impossible for us to sur
pass the Harvard Business School by following a method of education 
in which it was the expert.
The essence of the development of a strategy for the University is 
the concept of comparative advantage. We have to find for each of our 
departments areas in which to concentrate because we are always going 
to have departments that are too small to cover the complete range of 
any discipline. These areas must be ones in which we have some advan
tages through faculty in the department, other faculty or departments 
in the University, geographical location, or some other basis. We must 
find those advantages and develop a department which concentrates 
its strengths on those special areas. When we build in this way, we have 
the opportunity to become one of the top departments in that disci
pline.
The current strategy in Mathematics is a good example of the points 
I am making. We are developing a program in applied mathematics 
based on computer science, statistics, and operations research in addi
tion to mathematics. With our strengths in each of these areas we have 
the ability to cross departmental lines far more easily than most univer
sities. It is my feeling that this area of study in undergraduate applied 
mathematics will develop into a leading national program. Conversely, 
if we were to build a department in pure mathematics, modeling our
selves after Harvard, we would face a diffficult task for many reasons, 
not the least of which is the length of time Harvard has had its Depart
ment of Pure Mathematics.
It is this reasoning that leads me to say that we cannot take a tradi
tional approach to developing excellence in our College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences. We have no comparative advantage to enable us to 
overcome the traditions and head start that some of these other major 
universities have upon us in that area. On the other hand, we have many 
ideas for strategies to develop H&SS into the leading liberal arts college 
of its kind in the nation. We have strength in the social sciences, and it 
is possible to develop that aspect of the school in such a way that Eng
lish and history are strengthened at the same time. One strategy con
ceived to give our liveral arts college uniqueness was the concept of a 
liberal-professional eduaction, which has a long tradition at CMU. We 
made a good start on that approach under Dean Steinbergs leadership 
when we developed the professional minor to meet the challenge of 
professional education which exists in the rest of the University. The 
challenge to the new dean and the faculty is to develop additional strat
egies for the College that will enhance its uniqueness and enable it to 
blossom into a leading liberal arts college. I am certain that Dean 
Crecine with the cooperation of the faculty and the students will lead 
the way toward the achievement of such an objective.
It is the conscious development of a strategy that has enabled this 
University to achieve departments and colleges of national and world 
stature, while competing with universities of greater size and far more 
wealth.

STOLEN TRAFFIC SIGNS 
POSE SAFETY PROBLEM
The vandalism of traffic signs seems 
like a harmless prank, yet in many cases 
the result is the death or injury of in
nocent victims.
In Illinois, vandalism of road signs 
carries up to a $1,000 fine and the 
person responsible is criminally liable 
for any damage which happens at the 
scene.
At Bradley University the security 
force confiscated eight signs from a 
fraternity house. The signs, worth $150, 
ranged from stop signs to a school 
crossing sign.
Just about a month before these find
ings, a stop sign had been removed at 
an intersection in Northern Illinois, 
resulting in the death of an entire 
family whose car was hit by a semi
trailer truck.

KUNTSLER:
GOVERNMENT PERVERTS LAW
Lawyer William Kuntsler spoke to a 
standing room only crowd of students 
at Yale University and charged that the 
government is using the law as a tool 
to keep the ruling class ruling.
Kuntsler stated that those in control 
are using their power to distort the law 
and control decent people. He sub
stantiated his claims of legal perver
sion with many examples including the 
following:
1) In reversing a 700 year old tradi
tion, the Supreme Court has ruled that 
in all cases a unanimous jury decision 
is no longer required.
2) Kuntsler pointed out that through
out the Federal and State legal systems 
the jury selection has been placed in the 
hands of the judges.
3) In addition, peremptory challenges 
are today distributed equally between 
the defense and the prosecution. 
Kuntsler pointed out that if a person 
is black, the prosecutions peremptory 
challenges may make sure there are 
no blacks on the jury. This ruling 
jeopardizes the right to be judged by 
ones peers.

PLAY FACTORY
The -word school comes from the 
Greek Skole, which means leisure. 
Yet a students life is endlessly con
cerned with work shops, homework, 
work loads, class work, work schedules, 
work sheets, works of art, etc.
To combat this lack of playfulness 
among college students, a madcap 
professor at Kansas State College, Bill 
Harper, has started the Play Factory 
to make play an end, not a means. In
stead of emphasizing playing for good 
health, therapy, social acceptance, 
money, grades, trophies, etc.. Harper 
encourages the leisure qualities not 
prized these days, such as fun, silence, 
contemplation, celebration, wonder 
and fantasy.
Harper feels that kids first get into 
sports because they are playful but get 
caught up in our societys system of 
rewards. In an effort to insure a stu
dents well being, Harper has tried to 
increase playfulness in sports by adding 
his own ingredients to traditional 
athletics, such as no boundary lines 
and mixed teams of men and women, 
as well as inventing new sports such as 
spitting contests and kite flying festi
vals.
Harper admits that there is a con
tradiction in making play, yet perhaps 
this is a first step to spontaneous play.

CASH BY CALL
The Western Union Telegraph Company 
announces that beginning August 4, 1975 
the Money Order-by-phone service was 
extended to all Master Charge card
holders in the 48 contiguous states, pro
viding students on college campuses 
with a fast and simple way of sending 
and obtaining money in a hurry.
This service now eliminates the 
necessity of depositing cash in person 
at a Western Union office or agency. 
By simply calling 800 - 851-2300 (in 
Illinois 800-642-2430) toll free at any 
hour of the day or night, a Master 
Charge cardholder can transmit up to 
$300 in cash by charging it to their 
Master Charge account.
Western Union then checks the in
dividual account and advises the sender 
of the location and hours of the paying 
office closest to the intended recipient.
Delivery is guaranteed within two 
hours to any of more than 5.000 Western 
Union offices or agencies when that 
office or agency is open, however, past 
experience has shown that trans
missions have usually been made within 
30 minutes.
Since many students do live away 
from home, the distance between them 
and emergency funds is shortened by 
this fast, efficient way of wiring money. 
It makes it easier for both students and 
parents to transmit and receive money 
for tuition, books, travel expenses, and 
the many situations where students Find 
an immediate need for money, with as 
little effort as dialing the phone; and 
in emergency situations like these, keep
ing inconvenience at a minimum is 
mandatory.
Cash to the customer for a charge 
card money order is $6.75 plus the cash 
amount requested for money orders up 
to $50. The service fee rises by $.75 
for each additional $50 or less to a 
maximum of $10.50 for a $300 money 
order, the maximum amount allowed.

GAYS, NOT SPECIMENS
In reaction to an article in the DAILY 
ILLINI describing the habits and be
haviors of the Gay World, the paper 
received a letter to the editor.
It included the following: We are 
not specimens for some new type of 
Audobon society. We are tired of 
straight people entering our bars to 
watch and point out the beauty of our 
colors and to comment on how well 
we dance and how we always have the 
hottest music in town. That kind of be
havior is beginning to exasperate us 
colorful little animals.
Although we cannot stop you, we do 
not want you in our bars. We do not 
need your type of publicity or friend
ship. If you actually do believe that 
some of your best friends are gay, start 
treating them like friends and stop 
tracking them down.

MICHENER:
HANG ON THROUGH THE CRAP!
Dont be too calculating. Dont be too 
scientific. Dont let the shrinks terrify 
you or dictate the movements of your 
' life.
There is a divine irrelevance in the 
universe and many men and women win 
through to a sense of greatness in their 
lives by stumbling and fumbling their 
way into patterns that gratify them and 
allow them to utilize their endowments 
to the maximum.
If Swarthmore College in 1925 had 
employed even a half-way decent 
guidance counselor, I would have spent 
my life as an assistant professor of 
education in some midwestern uni
versity. Because when I reported to 
college it must have been apparent to 
everyone that I was destined for some 
kind of academic career. Nevertheless, 
I was allowed to take Spanish, which 
leads to nothing, instead of French 
or German, which as everyone knows 
are important languages studied by 
serious students who wish to gain a 
Ph.D.
Instead, I continued to putter around 
with Spanish and found a deep affinity 
for it. In the end, I was able to write 
a book about Spain which will probably 
live longer than anything else Ive done. 
In other words, I blindly backed into a 
minor masterpiece ....
I had spend a good deal of my early 
time knocking around this country and 
Europe, trying to find out what I be
lieved in, what values were large 
enough to enlist my sympathies during 
what I sensed would be a long and con
fused life. Had I commited myself at 
age eighteen as I was encouraged to do,
I would not even have known the paiameters of the problems, and any choice 
I might have made then would have had 
to be wrong.
It took me 40 years to find out the 
facts.
As a consequence, I have never been 
able to feel anxiety about young people 
who are fumbling their vy toward the 
enlightenment that will keep them go
ing. I doubt that a young man  unless 
he wants to be a doctor or a research 
chemist, where a substantial body of 
specific knowledge must be mastered 
within a prescribed time  can waste 
time, regardless of what he does. I 
believe you have till age thirty-five to 
decide finally on what you are going to 
do, and that any exploration you pursue 
in the process will in the end turn out 
to have been creative.
Indeed, it may well be the year that 
observers describe as wasted that will 
prove to have been the most productive 
of those insights which will keep you 
going.

THE TARTAN-December 9.1975-page 7
Pennsylvania's BalletIn Orbit
By J. Oliver bietcher
Like an Oriental jewel, fine dance in Pitts
burgh is an infrequent treat to those who do 
not have easy access to it. The Pennsylvania 
Ballet is one of those precious gems that, 
while on tour, illuminate the otherwise 
mundane programs of tinsel and glitter.
Three years into its second decade, the 
Pennsylvania Ballet is no longer considered a 
satellite of George Balanchine but as an auto
nomous company, propelling itself into an 
orbit rarely seen and acclaimed outside of 
New York City. Yet, like a teen-ager the 
company has yet to acquire that distinctive 
style or personality associated with compan
ies of comparable stature. This, no doubt, 
will come in a few more seasons or when an 
unmistakable, inimitable choreographic style 
becomes part of the companys artistic pro
file.
The program offered last week at Heinz 
Hall was like an invitation to a Chamber 
affair. The audience was small and for the 
most part, knowledgeable, of the Pennsyl
vanians potential. Adagio-Hammerklavier, 
(Beethoven, opus 106-choreography by Hans 
Van Manen), performed on a stark blue stage 
in practice clothes, was like entering a room 
draped in heavy velvet and having, as the 
music progresses, veils lifted singularly and 
slowly until the end. The six dancers were 
devoid of passion yet passionate in the var
ious pas de deux. The entire piece, solemn 
but not depressing, was deliberate and con
trolled. There were classical lifts that a 
second later became modem. Turned out 
feet were turned in, points were flexed as if 
we were witnessing the marriage of classical 
and modern dance. Beautiful.
In Retrospect, choreographed by the 
companys ballet master, Robert Rodham, is 
not, though it attempts to be, a very cerebral 
piece. The superb Lawrence Rhodes danced 
the Lear-like role in which a man comes to 
terms with his loneliness through visions of 
past experiences personified by five pas de 
deux in which Rhodes aches to participate, 
the dancers oblivious to his presence. The
K/T7J
feet exercise in dance counterpoint. When 
they do it, its theirs. The geometric sym
metrical choreography calls for movement 
that precedes the music and themes repeated 
by the demi-soloists and corps de ballet. Un
fortunately, due to last moment program 
changes, and a noticeable problem with the 
dance floor, it was a little less than perfect 
this time. The dancers were a little tired and 
the changes left everyone a bit uncertain. 
The strenuous second movement was confi
dently performed by Michelle Lucci but 
lacked the kind of panache that lets an aud
ience know a dancer has taken full control 
of his role and not vice-versa. Yet it was a 
case in which the positives outweigh the 
negatives. It was the realization of potential, 
the gate to human perfection.
Special notices must go to two exemplary 
dancers in this star-less company, Joanne 
Danto and Lawrence Rhodes. Rhodes is the 
rarefied male dancer, who does not substi
tute bombastic style for ability. He possesses 
control, speed and a dramatic ability that 
enables him to literally soar in any role.
Joanne Danto, a fine technician, has 
welded her technique together with her cool 
style, perfect feet and amazing extensions. 
Unlike many star-studded companies, any 
member of the corps can step into a major 
role. Rare.
The Pennsylvania Ballet will return in April.

choreography, though sometimes interesting The Balanchine neo-classical masterpiece And finally a note of apology. Several 
and well danced, by Joanne Danto in particSymphony in C, performed by the Pennsylweeks ago I reviewed the Pittsburgh Ballet
ular, reminded me of a Hollywood musicvanja Ballet has been acclaimed by many to Symphony in C as the future Steel Symmelodrama in which the action stops and, ^ 35 good as the New York City Ballets verphony. A grand faux pas. Sorry Mr. Balada, 
from no impetus, a dance ensues. The Not that the Pennsylvanians set out to Sorry Mr. Petrov and Company,
ballet was replete with a mystenously-veiled copy step-for-arm movement of the New
woman who offered very little in the way of Yorkers, but rather they execute it as a perillumination when mostly needed. Neatness 
was sometimes sacrificed for speed, but 
Rhodes held it together and provided a co
hesiveness which the choreography lacked.

'Dog Day Afternoon': Tragic
by Mark Evan Chimsky
In eleventh grade, I was told we lack 
modern dramatic tragedies because all the 
kings had died. It was one of those cardin
al Lit-class myths, used to tidy up any 
doubts we may have had about th differ
ence between Shakespearean drama and 
the drama of the twentieth century. If it 
was modem, it was pathetic, not tragic. 
The cozy rationale sounded suspiciously 
like an excuse; witless logic masquerading 
as law.
Dog Day Afternoon is a laymans 
tragedy. The hero is no kinghes a bi
sexual with a cow of a wife, two kids, a 
male wife, and a bank robbery on his 
hands. Unlike a Lear or a Macbeth, the 
tragedy is not in the majestic fall, but 
rather, in his small, haplessly random 
collapse.
Sonny (Al Pacino) is by nature dis
heveled. His fury of hair and fugitive eyes, 
which seem forever in search of a target, 
externalize his confusion. Nothing is right 
and Sonny bungles everything till it all be
comes worse. He is a street punk, who 
loves grandly, translating his passion into 
action. There is an odd eloquence to his 
desperation, a romanticism that is almost 
courtly (he robs the bank in order to 
afford a sex-change operation for his male 
Vife.) He is Romeo gone Bisexual.
The purity of purpose in Sonnys 
frantic, single-minded assault on the Brook
lyn. bank gets muddled with the onslaught 
of police, reporters, and onlookers, who 
begin queuing up like a bunch of curious 
theatre-goers. The event becomes theatri
cal. The commonplace spectacle of Sonny 
and his manically peevish friend, Sal (John
Cazale), holding seven bank employees 
hostage becomes glamorous because of its 
awesome authenticity . This is the high dra
ma of the streets; immediate, accessible 
Pop-Culture adventure. Television cameras 
whir; reporters from various stations 
speak simultaneously into their mikesSonny takes to watching himself on the
evening news. Newlyaware of themselves 
as performers, the characters burlesque re
ality with a gritty bravado. Sonny,somewhat 
assured by his media-recycled identity, 
struts and flails, a triumphant star. The 
crowd responds as a delighted-to-be-raucous Greek chorus, cheering the maverick 
Sonny, the stray dog badgered by the 
cops.
with a hushed, even-measured flourish and 
then jumps away, shouting Im a fucking 
star! The eager media reporters are not 
particularly responsible for the trumpingup of the robbery--it is the characters 
themselves, cursed with the sin of know
ingness, who hawk the nightmarish inci
dent as if it were a vaudeville routine.
The crowd is instrumental in Di
rector Sidney Lumets vision of the inci
dent. Their sloganized support of the Son
ny they do not know is ironical: they rally 
behind defiant, anti-authoritarian Every
man, their robust shouts of revealing a 
vicarious identification. Midway 
through the film, when the learn of Son
nys homosexual marriage , the friendly 
natives turn contemptuous , and strike up a 
litany of hisses. The crowd establishes a 
moral code, sympathetically condoning 
Sonny as victimizer, and yet quick to con
demn him for a victimless crime. It is an 
inside-out morality, and the chaos of Son
nys life comes as a natural consequence 
of this sort of topsy-turvy societal order.
The characters indulge in a spirited 
culture-shock, histrionically milking their 
bit parts in history. A neighborhood de
livery boy presents Sonny with a pizza
Their out-sized perception of themselves as 
celebrities comforts them-the hostages co
operate in dragging out their own captivity. 
Without even trying, theyve been rede
fined as extraordinary and they all set up 
house in the bank, louging casually in front 
of the TV, drowsing in comers, ordering 
dinner-one frizzy-haired young woman 
practices drill squad acrobatics with Son
nys machine gun. The bank begins to re
semble those leisurely domains of the very 
rich. It is an ivory tower of domesticity, 
with the police outside forming a 
relentless moat.
Sonnys male Vife Leon, wrapped
in a terrycloth robe, is carted in from 
Bellevue, to a nearby, make-shift police 
station. The telephone serves as Sonnys 
life-line; he pleads with Leon to join him,
Dedicated to Charlotte
the police indifferently monitor the conn
ection. Leon is Sonnys last chance, his 
only hope. Sonny, risking everything for 
love, achieves a kind of nobility in his 
quixotic, all-stops-out struggle to collect 
enough loot to buy his lover a new gender. 
But, Leon refuses to join him. It is a quiet 
moment, in which Sonnys head drops like 
a marionettes. The scene reverberates with 
Othellos shuddering judgement of him
self as a man who loved not wisely but too 
well. There is a sad grace, a one-note help
lessness to Sonnys response that signals his 
penultimate dispair. It is the trap-floor 
betrayal; the slow, irremediable fall.
Sonny orders a jet to Algeria, 
but fails in his effort to escape. The film 
ends with Sonnys final humiliation: the 
hurried frisk and arrest by a group of effi
cient policemen. It is this sort fof effi
ciency which Sonny has raged againstin 
one early scene, he tells an officer that he 
had preferred to be passionately murdered 
rather than matter-of -factly wiped out. 
Though hes forever claiming hes dying, 
Sonny loves the energizing passion of life 
too dearly to accept losing it to indifferent 
assassins. At the close of the film, Sonny is 
hauled into a police car horribly estranged 
from the impulsive passion that was his 
life.
Director Lumet works against the 
bold grain of high drama, for the most 
part, the film is played as fine-line, hectic 
farce; the comic turns serve to heighten the 
blunt and merciless finale of turnabouts. 
There is a subtle shift in absurdities: from 
the Mack Sennett-like scurry of the first 
minutes of the hold-up to Leons stammer
ing, drugged-up refusal of Sonnys get-away 
proposal. 
A man loses everything, with barely 
any time for grief. Lumets pace is brisk, a 
jumpy, mock-McLuhanesque ragtag of 
zooms and pans and hand-held camera 
shots that angle us into the cinema verite 
feel of the film. He is good with the 
ironic, throwaway details of crises. (When

Lumets wonderfully modulated 
direction allows for careful development
 of characters. With cumulative force, A1 
Pacino builds toward a complex, vital 
Sonny. There is a great concentration here 
on the gradualness of development: the 
casual eye-tic that is easily dismissed ear
ly on, is repeated with startling consis
tency. Only near the end, when Sonnys
impeccable. John Cazale as Sal sulks 
around with paranoic apprehension, his 
hands looking frail and out-of-place on his 
ever-ready machine gun. Charles Durning 
is marvelous as the compassionate cop, 
the bullish perfectionist, who takes Sonny 
on in an exasperating verbal wrestle, not 
because it is his duty, but because he re
fuses to let Sonny lose so dangerous a 
game without a fight.
Lumet chances a farcial approach 
that is unsentimentalized, hard-edged in
Al Pacino as Sonny grips a hostage while shouting down the double-talk 
bargains of the ubiquitous police.
face seizures, briefly, going tense and then 
slack, do we realize the frightening impliI cations of his fatigued anxiety. He is all 
loose nerve endings, exposed and fighting 
fiercely for control. It is a remarkable char
acterization; Pacino makes Sonny shrewd
ly instinctive, a wise kid suddenly aston
ished and beguiled by his own quick pop
ularity. His Sonny becomes a counter
culture entertainer, striving to be cool, 
funny in his frenzied earnestness, and fail( ing fast.
The supporting cast is just about
a film which is essentially about the awful 
leveling of one mans life. We are moved 
by the films off-centered toughness, 
its characters desperately stoic, wackedout humor in the face of defeat. We are 
indeed shaken by the tragedy of men 
who are not kings. With Chris Sarandon 
as Leon. Screenplay by Frank Pierson. 
Based on the actual events of a 1972 
Brooklyn bank robbery.

Page 12-THE TARTAN-December 9, 1975
Quiff's Top Ten Fave Raves
It was another great year for music fans. 
Many artists reshuffled their styles and a lot 
of obscure musicians came up with new 
winning hands. I noticed that a lot of old 
faces resurfaced these last few months. 
Many of the top performers found new di
rections which supplied the fuel to reach 
out to new fans. The female vocalists had a 
super year and Joni Mitchell, Grace Slick, . 
and Carole King proved that point. Also 
the disco scene really came on strong 
which goes to show that there was lots of 
energy and back-to-the-roots music spin
ning on the wheel of good fortune.
Special mention goes out to David 
Bbwie, (Young Americans) Fleetwood 
Mac, Rufus, (Rufisized) and the Allman 
Brothers (Win, Lose or Draw). These re
cords did not find their way onto my list 
of the years ten best but they were all 
superb. Now, without further hype or in
sight, the top ten records of 1975.
10. Thats the Way of the World by 
Earth, Wind, and Fire. This album could 
have easily been replaced by the latest re
lease from the Average White Band, but I 
was overwhelmed by the strong perfor
mance of this provocative soul/jazz group. 
All of the eight songs have commercial 
potential, and you dont have to be black 
to enjoy the musical mood that E,W&F 
create. Once again, Maurice White has 
established himself as one of the leading 
male vocalists/arrangers of modern soul. 
Both singles, (Shining Star and the title 
cut) illustrate what a great success this 
band has achieved.
9. Nils Lofgren by Nils Lofgren. There 
was some great rock-and-roll being dealt 
all year but I found the Lofgren album to 
be the most enjoyable. Nils Lofgren comes 
from the Washington/Baltimore area and 
he once held national attention with a 
group called Grin. After Grin broke up, 
Lofgren did some studio work with Neil
Young and Crazy Horse. Now Lofgren is 
on his own and the result is solid rockand-roll. All of the tunes are lively, with 
most of them being penned by Lofgren. 
His approach is flawless. There is just your 
usual bass, drum, vocals, and an electrify
ing lead guitar. The latter is supplied by 
Lofgren, who learned a lot of the tricks of
to add these pop masterpieces to my list.
7. Jamal Plays Jamal by Ahmad Jamal. 
This is my official jazz pick but the music 
is heavily influenced by some of the great 
classical composers. Jamal has been around 
for a very long time and this dynamic 
pianist gets better with age. The main in
strumentation is piano, bass, and percusTom Scott (of the LA express) with Joni Mitchell
the trade from Roy Buchanan. If you en
joy old Stones, Beatles, or even Lofgrens 
own band, Grin, youll love this disc.
8. Hearts by America!Between the Lines 
by'Janis Ian. These two tied and its not 
suprising because both artists had super 
comebacks. Both Hearts and Between the 
Lines were red hot pop music successes. 
Fine vocals coupled with sensitive lyrics 
mark the two albums. I dont have to men
tion that there were a number of top hits 
this year that can be found on either the 
Ian or the America disc. I had the pleasure 
of seeing both artists in recent months 
and they made it all the easier to decide
sion yet the listener feels like he or she 
is listening to a much larger band. Jamal is 
getting the tremendous swirling effect of 
a Jarret, but hardly any of the attention. 
All of the cuts have a Chopin flavor to 
them, and Im gambling that if youre a 
jazz or classical buff, youre gonna love thisN 
one.
6. Lovers by Mickey Newbury. Im part
icularly fond of this one. Newbury happens 
to be one of the most sophisticated coun
try composers in music today,-yet he fails 
to receive the recognition that Waylon 
Jennings. and Tom T. Hall cash in on. 
Lovers is a country-flavored yarn about a
lonely man remembering the great love 
affair that he once had. Newburys vocals 
are exceptionally well done. The string and 
the horn arrangements will make any per
son forget that the music is country. Chet 
Atkins helps out on guitar and so does 
Charlie McCoy on harmonica. If country 
music ever came packaged in symphony ^ 
form, it would sound like Lovers; by 
Mickey Newbury.
5. Tom Cat by Tom Scott/Blow by 
Blow by Jeff Beck. These two albums 
sound so similiar that I often play one and 
tell friends that its the other. Both discs 
are get-down jazz/rock efforts. Beck steals 
the show on the Blow by Blow album, but 
the entire L.A. Express (Scotts band) contributes to the'7ow Cat album. Each one 
of these artists have expanded their cult 
followings with the wider dimensions of 
these two recordings. Best cuts include the 
Beatless Shes A Woman on the Beck 
disc and Rock Island Rocket for the 
Tom Cat creation.
4. Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan. 
This recording has as many sides to it as a 
Royal Straight Flush ^Supposedly this is ^ 
Dylans comeback album, but this album is 
still another step further for the Minnosota 
minstrel. Dylan went back to the folk gui
tar and his words resemble the It Aint 
Me Babe period. Bob sounds hurt but 
theres great strength underneath that 
wounded skin. The music is restless, but 
its so damn lovely that my words cant do 
it justice. This album is a solid winner and C> 
if any of us have the year that Dylans 
been having, we sure wont need to worry 
about tomorrow. Thanks Bob.
3. Mile of Aisles by Joni Mitchell and 
the L.A. Express. This is the live recording 
of some of Jonis best hits. The perfor
mance is spectacular and Joni has found a 
real jazzy vein. I dont think the L.A. Ex

Why Would A Fine Arts Student Tak ROTC?
Eli Homza, B.A. Music, '69, Currently Attending The 
University of Pittsburgh Graduate School Says:
Why did I choose the career of an Army offiier? Ob
viously, there were some very pragmatic incentives-ari ex
cellent salary plan, free medical and dental care, a superb 
retirement plan, travel opportuniies, and the possibility of 
continuing my civilian education free of charge. But these 
considerations were not-and probably should not-be the 
principal determinants. Rather, a career should be chosen 
because it seems to provide a work environment in which 
one can accomplish whatever one wants to accomplish 
with his life's work. I wanted to work with people. I wanted 
to have a personal positive influence on as many fellow 
members of my society as I could. My position as an Army 
officer has allowed me to do this.

They fit in with Jonis voice and music 
like roses at the Kentucky Derby. Joni 
herself has matured and Carey and 
Both Sides Now have never sounded 
better. Heres four sides of live warmth, 
give this album to the one you love.
2. Heart of Sat. Nite by Tom Waits. 
Waits is the unofficial poet of L.A. His 
gruff voice sings about the breakneck 
boulevards and the one-line-hey-you-gottadime spots of southern California. The 
music that Waits develops is a reconstruct
ed form of cool jazz and his sense of hu
mor is practically non-stop. Waits is a nifty 
piano player and he gives listeners the feel
ing that his music is a special bar room re
creation. All of the lyrics and comments by 
Waits raise the possibility that he may be 
the next Randy Newman, L.A. style.
1. Bom To Run by Bruce Springsteen. 
Even with all the hype, Bruce Springsteens 
latest performance on disc is still the most 
powerful recording that Ive heard all year. 
Bom To Run keeps all the promises that 
Bruce made with his first two albums. 
All of the instrumentation is clever and 
each song flows into the next one nicely. 
From the opening bid,- every bit of music 
seems planned perfectly. Sax man Clarence 
wails and the keyboard player has got more 
riffs than the whole Boston symphony. 
Thunder Road is the opening cut and 
its a symbolic tale of Springsteens deci
sion to tackle the rock and roll road to 
stardom. The rest of the songs follow the 
same motif. A close examination of the 
other tunes shows that all of the words are 
symbolic of Springsteens struggle with 
success. Theres a little Motown Soul as 
exhibited by Tenth Avenue Freeze Out 
and some New York free-form jazz on 
Meeting Across the River. Other in
fluences include reggae and fifties rock an 
roll. Bruce plays some incredible lead

guitar and he never loses sight of his musi
cal direction. The title cut is easily one of 
the best singles of the year, and the open
ing guitar riffs are as catchy as Layla or 
Ohio. Springsteens imagery is always 
consistent, depicting the witty, romantic 
side of the fierce city. Bom To Run con
cludes with a lengthy ballad called Jungleland. It's an appropriate ending for the 
album because the world is caught in a 
hazy war that Springsteen describes as 
somewhere between flesh and fantasy. All 
of the characters are caught in this frenzy 
that is painful but not fatal, a nice compar
ison to the record world and to real life. 
Add on some of the biggest names in jazz 
such as the Brecker Brothers and David 
Sanbourn and you have the most energet
ic, well planned album of 1975.
These selections are my own personal 
choices and I hope that everyone will give 
them a listen, even if you happen to dis

to give a special award to the album Horses

There are lots of student activities on 
campus and one of the most underrated 
events is the T.G.I.F. dance. T.G.I.F. stands 
for Thank God Its Friday and it is one of 
the most enjoyable free activities on the Carnegie-Mellon Campus. Practically every Fri
day afternoon, there is a live band in the Ski
bo Ballroom at 4:30. The talent ranges from
Lead singer Tommy Katsafands and lead quitarist 
Dean Drosents wow the Ballroom crowd
local entertainment to the best in live Pitts
burgh rock and roll. This past semester has 
seen acts such as the Rythmn Kings and the 
less familiar band, Madrigal.
Madrigal is a band comprised of talented 
college musicians from the Highland Park 
area of Pittsburgh. This five piece band has 
been together in various forms for the last 
several years. The band consists of Tommy 
Katsafanas on vocals and rythmn guitar, 
Dean Drosenis on lead guitar, Steve Taylor 
on bass, Bruce Morris at the drums, and 
Carnegie Mellons own James (Travis) Camp
bell playing electric piano.
The last T.G.I.F. before Thanksgiving 
featured the Madrigal band and they were 
most impressive. It was a well-rounded two 
hour set that surprised a lot of people who 
just happened to be passing by. Some of the 
songs performed were Trampled Under 
Foot by Led Zeplin, Rod Stewarts Every 
Picture Tells A Story, and even the Beatles 
Cant Buy Me Love. All of the tunes were
really fun to dance to -- say that I had a 
super time.
Bruce Lindsay who runs T.G.I.F. said 
that he was surprised at the support that 
Madrigal received. Bruce has been upset at 
the poor attendance at the T.G.I.Fs this 
year. There were lots of people dancing at 
the Madrigal gig and that floored me. I guess 
that people who usually come by decided to 
stay, and that the music was so good that it 
just brought people in from off the side
walk.
In the past years, T.G.I.F. has been pack
ed, but with the rising popularity of the 
disco sound and the larger emphasis being 
placed on top notch grades, the students 
have really stopped supporting T.G.I.F. 
Hopefully, the pendulum will start swinging 
back the other way.
That hope lies in bands like Madrigal. 
Lead singer Tom (and girls, hes good look
ing) Katsafanas believes that there is a sur
plus of excellent live Pittsburgh bands:
There are plenty of good bands in 
and around the Pittsburgh area. The 
Kings are fine, Christophers Rye is 
doing it, and I think we have tight knit 
band. Pittsburgh is a weird place 
cause there are not that many decent 
paying clubs. We had to do gigs in the 
park this summer and thats just asking 
for trouble. First you learn to swing, 
then you learn to sing. I think Carnegie-Mellon is performing a very useful 
service for the campus community and 
for local musicians.
Tom hopes to see his band and other lo
cal groups get some well deserved attention. 
In the future, he believes that rock could 
really expand if it gets the right exposure 
and support. But support, like anything 
else,-begins at home. So boogie on down to 
the next T.G.I.F. and watch for Madrigal.

B-BALL LOOKS GOOD 
But Drop Openers
By Elly Zimmerman
Maloneys dream was crushed Monday 
when CMUs basketball team suffered their 
first loss of the season to St. Vincent in 
overtime with the score 79-77.
The opening game proved to be quite an 
improvement over last years where CMU 
lost by 37 points.
The high point scorer, St. Vincents 
Leonard Wells shot the winning basket 
with one minute left in overtime. The 6-1 
sophomore guard had six points in over
time and 28 points overall.
Larry DiCicco, CMUs high point scorer 
with 21 points, tied the game in the last 
minute of regulation play with a basket 
that pulled CMU to a 68-68 tie.
At half-time CMU led with a one point 
lead, 33-32. They opened the second half 
with a 15 point surge that lasted seven 
minutes. Mike Boyle of the Bearcats initi
ated his teams comeback by making six 
points in five minutes.
CMU out rebounded St. Vincents 45 to 
39 times. The Tartans real downfall was 
their turnovers. They had 28 compared to 
St. Vincents 17. CMU also had two players 
injured at critical times. Dennis Derringer a 
6-6 senior suffered a third degree ankle 
injury. The injury will sideline him for 
eight weeks. Later Larry DiCicco suffered a 
leg cramp at a very crucial point in the 
game.
At one point CMU was up by four 
points in overtime but a three point play 
narrowed the gap to one. It was a fight to 
the finish as CMU and' St. Vincent tied 
several times. Wells jump shot was the 
final straw as CMU suffered their first 
loss of the season.

The first five minutes of play typified 
what was to follow as there were sloppy 
passes by both teams.
Fouls plagued both sides as Walshs 
Ronnie Moore drew two in the first seven 
minutes. Paul Hamerly of CMU picked up 
his second foul with 8:39 remaining in the 
half.
With 32 seconds left in the half, Walsh 
scored six points on turnovers to put them 
ahead 36-32 at half time. One basket was 
from mid-court at the buzzer.
After half-time CMU came back to tie it 
up to 38-38. For twelve and a half minutes 
the lead changed back and forth several 
times. With 3:30 left in the game CMU had 
the lead 61-60. The last three minutes 
proved to, be disastrous as CMU could not 
break the Walshs press. More often than 
not a CMU player would be double teamed 
and lose the ball on a hurried pass.
This years game was a far cry from last 
years where CMU was annihilated. The 
margin between the two teams last year 
was 64 points compared to the 9 point 
margin this time. The high point scorers 
for CMU were Larry DiCicco with 17 
points, Paul Hamerly with 15 points and 
Dane Wukich with 14.
Coach Maloney stated earlier this year 
that, I have no doubt that well be re
presentative and respectable this season 
and thats my main goal now. The fact 
that CMU is able to compete with teams 
such as Walsh and St. Vincent proves that 
basketball has come a long way in one 
year.
The teams next home game will be on 
January 14th against Bethany in the Skibo 
gym at 8:00.

The first period opened with CMU on 
the offense. This favorable state of affairs 
Pitt beat the CMU icers, 5-1, at the Civic 
In another of their classsic psych-outs 
Pitt beat the CMU icers, 5-1', at the Civic 
Arena on Sunday.
The first period opened with CMU on 
the offense. This favorable state of affairs 
did not last long, although in terms of 
offensive-defensive play, the whole game 
looked fairly even. Shots on goal came out 
even too, 22-22.
The Tartans did not play a co-ordinated 
first period and CMU got the first two 
penalties-however, Pitt soon caught 
up. Rick Vernon scored the first Pitt goal 
on a power play, after Dave Cornelius 
went to the penalty box to serve a trip
ping call against goalie Don Jacobson. 
After a Pitt penalty, and one against Mike 
Gallaway and two Pitt players, Pitt scored 
again on a quick shot from a face-off next 
to the Tartan goal. There was another 
penalty, this time on Cornelius and two 
Pitt players. (Most of the fights seemed to 
involve at least two Pitt players and one 
from Carnegie-Mellon.) Pitts Jeff Saunders 
made it 3-0 before the period ended. 
The second period was chiefly notable
for more penalties, six against Pitt (includ
ing misconduct) and five against CMU. 
The Panthers scored again to make it 4-0.
In the last period, the Tartans put their 
game together a little better. Pitt, on the 
other hand, concentrated on taking swipes 
at the Tartans instead of shots at the net. 
Pitt had five penalties (including two mis
conducts) to CMUs one and seven shots 
on goal to CMUs 10. Midway through the 
period, one of those Tartan shots finally 
got into the net. Tom Grimm, playing 
his last game for the year, knocked it in 
on a rebound from Matt Goldsmith whose 
shot had bounced off the post seconds 
before. Matt and Dave Cornelius assisted 
on the goal.
As indicated by the shots on goal, the 
final score did not reflect the course of the 
game. So many shots just missed going 
in, and the Panthers did not dominate 
play. But whereas Pitt capitalized on their 
chances, the Tartans did not, and thats 
how they lost it.
The first game after Christmas break is 
scheduled for January 11 at Penn State 
(Main Campus). Games against the Nittany 
Lions are always exciting and have the 
advantage of being hockey games rather 
than brawls.

was victorious by a score of 60-52. The 
swimmers were really psyched for this 
meet and their high spirits were justly re
warded.
The four returning swimmers are Dave 
Bankert, Jeff Bland, Amy Kilburg, and 
John Rossi. The rest of the team consists 
of first year swimmers.
This meet was exceptionally memorable 
because it resulted in five school records 
being set.

RIFLE LOSES
by Mark Smith #
The past week proved nearly disastrous 
for the CMU shooters, who lost three of 
their four matches. For the first time this 
year the team has a losing record of 5-6.
Wednesday, the Tartans faced Clarion 
and Grove City. Clarion had a reputation 
for being a tough team. CMU had easily 
beaten Grove City in the first match of the 
season. The Tartans shot a reasonably good 
1278, but it was not enough to beat either 
Clarions 1325 or Grove Citys 1290. The 
top five shooters for CMU were Mark 
Smith, Steve Strom, Bill Williams, Mark 
Cicerchi, and Ed Klemencic. Cicerchi 
posted a 248, his highest score to date.
In a second tri-meet Friday pernenial 
league winner IUP and Duquesne came to 
the CMU range. Although IUPs 1317 
easily beat the Tartans, CMUs 1283 
was nonetheless a respectable score. It 
beat Duquesne by 21 points.
Ron Pontius contributed to the effort 
with a career high of 257. Smith had the 
highest score of the match with 279. Russ 
Beebers 256, Steve Stroms 245 and Karen 
Azinge/s 244 completed the top five.
Keith Hordatt made the All Presidents 
Athletic Conference All-Stars in soccer. He 
was one of eleven players chosen from the 
teams in the PACs. This season he scored 
six goals while playing the center forward 
position. A freshman, Keith says, Hell 
be back next year.
