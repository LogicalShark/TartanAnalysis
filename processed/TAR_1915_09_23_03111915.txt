JANE ADDAMS P. A. A. INDOOR 
ADDRESSES STUDENTS MEET SATURDAY
This week marks the close of the 1915 
basketball season. The Varsity meets 
Bethany tonight and Marietta Satur
day night, both games to be played 
at the Field House and each one to be 
followed by a dance. There is no dis
counting the fact that our team has 
been a continual loser this season, so 
it seems quite proper at this point to 
make a short review of what has hap
pened in order that we may see where 
some of our mistakes have been made 
and where, if possible, they may be 
remedied in future seasons. The ef
fect of the present season is well in 
mind; it is now up to us to find the 
cause.
In the first place, let us examine 
the schedule. The season will run 
over some nine weeks and in that time 
we will have played nineteen games. 
In four of these weeks we have played 
twelve games, three in each week and 
each on three consecutive night; out 
of this number, eight have been played 
abroad and four at home and of these 
entire twelve games we have won just 
one. In other words, we have met the 
following teams: Juniata, Marietta,
Muskingum in the second week of Jan
uary; Grove City, Allegheny, Hiram, 
Geneva, Juniata (these five in the or
der named and all abroad); Alumni, 
West Virginia, Pitt, Westinghouse in 
the last three weeks. There was no 
glory in an institution like ours to play, 
single games with teams like Grove 
City, Hiram, and Muskingum, espe
cially abroad and on hard trips. Think 
of a team trying to play some one 
before and after a game with Alle
gheny at Meadville. Such a policy is 
simply pure folly. But we have been 
taught the lesson; now we should 
profit by the experience. Let the fu
ture schedule maker bear these sug
gestions in mind: Play less games in
a season, say twelve with a majority 
at home, and with one trip of say two 
games and two short trips of single 
games. Play teams abroad of nearer 
our own scholastic calibre not small 
institutions like Marietta, Grove City, 
Muskingum, Hiram, and the like; in
stitutions that usually have the hard
est teams to beat on account of the 
floor, officiating, or what not, and 
teams for which Tech gets no credit 
if they do happen to beat them. Let 
us proceed to schedule teams of the 
type that our football team will meet

Miss Jane Addams, founder of the 
Hull House in Chicago, and nationally 
renowned settlement worker, ad
dressed the student body at the Car
negie Music Hall, last Thursday after
noon. The subject of her address was, 
Changing Ideals of Peace! The 
public was invited to attend the lec
ture, and a great many took advantage 
of the opportunity. All classes in the 
school were stopped at 3:45. Secretary 
W. P. Field, in the absence of Direc
tor Hamerschlag, presided at the 
meeting and introduced Dean Breed, 
of the Margaret Morrison School, who 
in turn presented Miss Addams. The 
meeting was opened and closed with 
music by the Student Symphony Or
chestra, under tne directorship of Mr. 
Vic OBrien.
Miss Addams is one of the number 
of speakers whom the Carnegie En
dowment is sending about the coun
try to drive home the lessons of the 
European War. She has addressed, 
or will address in the very near future, 
the students of all the big colleges 
in the country.
Her address was an eloquent and 
convincing argument against war and 
the preparation for war. She advo
cated the building up of public opinion 
against war and the fastening of a 
spirit of internationality in order that 
permanent peace may be attained. 
She said that the thirteen colonies and 
the problems they faced and overcame 
should be the prototype after which 
should be modeled a federation of the 
European nations now engaged in a 
monstrous war. She also asserted 
that, we know, of course, that inter
national relations will, in the end, sub
mit to law, and rejoiced in the fact 
that each European nation claims that 
it is fighting but a war for existence, 
drawing from this the conclusion that, 
we may say that aggressive warfare 
is of the past and we have at least 
risen a little higher 'than the civiliza
tion of Napoleon. She declared that 
the secret and political reasons which 
led up to the war, could have as easily 
been settled before the Hague Tri
bunal as other lesser international 
problems had been solved there. In 
conclusion, she said 'that in time, na
tions, as individuals, would recognize 
courts as superior to wars for the 
settlement of individual differences.

Much enthusiasm has arisen among 
the sporting fans of Western Penn
sylvania over the Indoor Track Meet 
to be held by the P. A. A. next Satur
day night. The meet, which is to be 
held in the Duquesne Garden, will be 
one of the most interesting events of 
the year.
Princeton, Cornell, Pennsylvania, 
Carlisle, Penn State, Carnegie Tech, 
University of Pittsburgh, Indiana 
Normal, and the P. A. A. have teams 
entered, while many unattached men 
and members of eastern athletic clubs 
will compete. With this aggregation 
of stars the meet canot help but be 
one of the most interesting ever held 
in this section of the country and it 
will decide the M. A. A. championship.
Carnegie has entered her strongest 
team, and although competes with 
such teams as those named above, she 
is sure to turn out with a good number 
of points. One of the most interest
ing events in which Carnegie is en
tered will be the one-mile relay for 
Pennsylvania colleges. This event 
will be one of the feature events of 
the evening with Carnegie Tech, Car
lisle, Penn State and the University of 
Pittsburgh competing.

Early spring baseball practice start
ed last week in the gymnasium, with 
a squad of from thirty-five to forty 
men present. From now on until the 
weather warms up sufficiently indoor 
practice will be held every Tuesday 
and Thursday afternoons at 4:30 and 
Saturday mornings at 9:30. The in
door practice will be more in the form 
of exercises to take the stiffness out 
of the men and put them into good 
condition for outdoor practice later 
on.
This practice is of the greatest im
portance and all those who intend to 
go out for baseball, should report im
mediately and not wait until the squad 
gets out of doors. Nevertheless there 
are many fellows who regard indoor 
practice as a joke and do not report 
for it. The fellows that do this, how
ever, are practically sporting their 
chances of making the team for natur
ally, those who have been out all along 
will be considered first in every case. 
Therefore, lets see everybody out this 
afternoon.
A1 Wagner and Honus did the 
coaching at the first practice last 
Wednesday. Sad to say, however,

PLECEc DIcCAbD CAPc cOONP
The new catalogues inform us that 
Easter vacation begins March 26 at 
4:30 oclock and reminds us that the 
Plebe regulations regarding caps and 
socks and ties cease to be effective 
one week earlier than the date men
tioned. After Friday, the nineteenth 
of this month, the Plebes may discard 
their class clothing and as a result, 
the upperclassmen will probably have 
to don smoked-glass spectacles for 
protection against the 1918 display of 
foot and neck wear. But be that as 
it may, some concerted action should 
be taken in disposing of the much 
abused masculine millinery. In many 
schools the caps are burned and re
duced to ashes with funereal rites and 
ceremonies. Just what procedure 
should be followed in our case should 
be decided by the Senior Discipline 
Committee, which formulated the Car
negie Code, after obtaining some ex
pression of the Plebes preference.
Although they may be unaware of 
the fact, the members of the class of 
1918 are the first Carnegie students 
to wear the caps longer than a sem
ester. They are to be complimented 
for the manner in which they co-oper
ated with the Seniors because by so 
doing, they not only complied with 
the latters demands, but also aided 
to establish a new school custom, one 
similar to which prevails in nearly 
every large college and university of 
the country. The class of 1915 also 
deseirves credit for suggesting and 
creating this practice at Carnegie. 
Their reward lies in the successful ac
complishment of their purpose.

Being a short dissertation on the 
shortcomings of one of our student 
organizations,The Band.
My Heart is in the Work is a 
motto we all know well, and one 
which is well exemplified in all depart
ments of the school, both academic 
and athletic. It has been a very no
ticeable fact during the past two 
months that in the Band there are 
workers and there are shirkers. The 
feeling of self-interest on the part of 
some of the members has taken the 
place of the,My Heart is in the 
Work feeling, and the standard of 
the Band is beginning to decline. The 
stfident body has stood loyally by the 
Band, the Student Activities Commit
tee has been very generous in its car
ing for the Bands needs, and they 
will continue to do so, providing the 
shirkers get together with the work
ers. It was very noticeable at the 
basketball game on last Friday night 
that some few members of the Band 
were missing, and the Band was far 
from being the one that cheered us 
on to glorious victories last fall. Some 
absentees, may at times have a valid 
excuse, but some have not. The Band 
is not often called upon to participate 
in the affairs of the student body, but 
when the call is given, why not have 
a full turnout? The student body ap
preciates the services of the Band in the 
past and present, and its members are 
today wearing a mark of their appre
ciation in the shape of uniforms. How
ever, no organization can exist if there 
is a lack of unity of purpose, and ac
tion, and the feeling of, My Heart 
is in the Work. Get on the job; let 
there be no shirkers but all workers, 
for Dear Old Tech, Carnegie Tech, 
and the Band.
One who has the interest of the 
Band at heart,
E. F. Sullivan, Dir.
IHE FIbcI bOOIc OF PEACEP
When one considers that the fight
ing powers seem to be treating the 
neutral nations more and more as im
pertinent outsiders, there seems to be 
small hope of peace or concessions 
either by conference, or as a result 
of national temperamental character
istics. And yet if one will consider 
the past record of the Hague Peace 
Conference, of National Peace Socie
ties and of their resulting effects, the 
question assumes a highly different 
mien.
The war of 1812 was followed by 
about a quarter of a century of peace, 
when people seemed to be recovering 
from its strain, weary and tired of war 
and its wages. Some years later we 
find the first mark of a peace enthusi
asm taking place in New York City 
while at the same time a series of 
peace conferences were held in the 
European capitols. Then followed 
another era of war and the following 
years of 1887, 1888 and 1899 are 
marked again as those of Peace Con
ference yearsr
It is peculiarly interesting to note 
that the first Hague Conference of
1889 was the result of the action of 
Nicholas II, then Czar of Russia. 
Such bears its uniqueness in the fact, 
that one hardly would look to such a 
ruler for an action in the direction of 
peace ends particularly when he rep
resents an authority unchecked by any 
parliamentary restrictions and also the 
head of a nation upon whose military 
ambitions no check is gaged.
This first conference proved highly 
successful, but was abruptly shattered 
by the Boer War followed by the 
Russo-Japanese War Then, when 
the Treaty of Portsmouth, N. H., end
ed the Russo-Japanese War, we again 
find the Russian Czar the instigator of 
the second Hague Conference of 1907 
to which Mr. Roosevelt was a direct 
and valuable aid.
However, the rise of peace enthusi
asm can be traced to a more remote 
and ultimately a more advantageous 
cause than the action of any ruler, it 
is the result of the early formation of 
peace societies in America. One of 
the earliest of these unions to produce 
effective work is the Interparlia
mentary Union which was distantly 
responsible for both conferences at 
the Hague in 1899 and 1907. The 
members of this union being delegates 
elected by the people to represent 
their desires for peace in the United 
States Congress, the Parliament of 
Great Britain and Ireland; and in all 
Parliaments of Europe. This and 
similar unions were embryonic seeds 
which grew into so powerful an or
ganization as the Hague Conference.

Dear Sir:
During the last few weeks a num
ber of letters have been sent from this 
office to High School Principals and 
Superintendents in various cities, es
pecially in the west, stating that a 
number of our students are preparing 
themselves for teachers in the School 
of Applied Industries for Industrial 
Training, and in the Margaret Morri
son Carnegie School for teachers in 
Household Arts, Household Econ
omics, Arts and Crafts, Secretarial 
work, etc., and asking what the re
quirements are to qualify for teaching 
positions under their supervision for 
the coming year.
We have received a great many re
plies, in some cases enclosing appli
cation blanks which it will be neces
sary to file with the Principals on or 
before March 31st. These application 
blanks and any other information re
lating to teaching positions can be 
had at any time by calling at this 
office.
Yours truly,

Last Thursday night, Carnegies 
basketball team defeated West Vir
ginias fast five by the ;'core of 38 to 
31. From beginning to end the game 
was full of excitement and afforded 
great interest to those Plaid backers 
who were present. The attendance, 
however, was smaller than that of the 
preceding games.
During the first few minutes of play 
Carnegies team seemed to be peace
fully sleeping. West Virginia took this 
as an opportunity to cast a good scare 
into the Plaid camp and made 8 points 
to Carnegies 3. Then the home team 
woke up and taking a new lease on 
life, they managed to have four bas
kets and three fouls added onto their 
score before the visitors knew what 
was happening. This left the score 
14 to 8 in favor of the Techites. After 
those moments of suspense were over 
the West Virginians didnt seem able 
to catch up again. But, be that as 
it may, the visitors score at times 
loomed up threateningly close to 
Carnegies. At such times, however, 
Levy or Schiffer always seemed to be 
waiting with a field goal to enlarge 
the lead again. Levy seemed to be 
doing the most in the scoring line and 
had 3 field goals credited up to him.
In the first half he started out to do 
the foul shooting, but he seemed to 
have difficulty in finding the basket. 
Captain Hines then took a hand at 
that department of the game. In the 
second half Levy tried again and this 
time dropped almost all in, one after 
the other. He totaled up 17 fouls out 
of 25 chances. Captain Hines seemed 
to be all over the floor at one timeHe also seemed to be on hand when 
the visitors wanted to shoot and 
fooled them several times by break
ing up their shots. Dutch Henning 
did some spectacular stunts in the 
middle of the first half when he took 
the ball down the field from his guard 
position and dropped in two baskets 
in a row. A queer incident occurred 
when Schiffer and Meredith both put 
the ball in on a couple of jumps from 
right under the basket. Race and 
Keating seemed to be the most dan
gerous of West Virginias players. 
Both men played fast games and 
were credited with three baskets. Hite 
played a guard for West Virginia and 
at the same time managed to do some 
pretty offensive work, shooting sev
eral baskets.
FtTsr HeMfP
Race started things with a foul and 
a field goal. Then Levy tied up the 
score with a basket and a foul. Keat
ing dropped one in and Race popped 
another foul. Hite came across with 
a basket. Hines took his hand at 
Carnegies foul shooting and tossed 
it in twice. Schiffer scored. Hines 
made another foul, and Dutch Hen
ning popped in two field goals. Levy 
landed one. Race dropped in a couple 
of fouls for West Virginia and the 
visitors came out of their slump. Levy 
made a basket and then Race made 
a basket and a foul. This ended the 
scoring for the half. Score: Car
negie, 15; West Virginia, 13.
cacsgl HeMfP
Kirsting scored on a foul and Levy 
put in a foul also. Then Schiffer 
jumped the ball in from a toss almost 
below the basket. Keating scored 
and then Meredith duplicated Schiffers trick. Hite made a basket. Then 
Levy came into his prime and popped 
in four fouls in succession. Kirsting 
put one into the basket and immedi
ately afterwards Keating scored. Levy 
made another foul and Kirsting 
scored again. Levy added two more 
points from the foul line and Kirst
ing one. Levy added another point 
from a foul and Race tossed the ball 
in. Then Levy made a couple more 
fouls and a basket. At once Kirsting 
scored from foul for his team. Hite 
scored and Levy made a foul. An
other foul by Kirsting and a basket 
by Hines closed the scoring. Score:

Mr. J. B. Connelly, Traffic Man
ager of the Mesta Machine Co., spoke 
Wednesday evening, March 3, to the 
members of the Fulcrum Club, at their 
regular monthly meeting on The 
Problems of Traffic and Their Solu

phases of the traffic business and 
showed what problems the traffic 
manager of an up-to-date manufactur
ing concern had to contend with and 
how they were successfully solved.

Navy and Cornell are included.
The Michigan Athletic Association 
made $30,000 in football last year but 
baseball lost $2,700 and track, -4,000, 
student fees alone came to $25,430.
The examination halls at Oxford 
have been converted into a hospital 
for wounded soldiers. The total en
rollment shows a decrease of twothirds of the usual number. Most of 
the men enrolled are freshmen.
Henceforth the members of the stu
dent council at Ohio State is to be 
composed not of members from the 
various classes, but of members from 
the different colleges.
A new Agricultural College Build
ing is nearing completion at Ohio 
University at Athens. This building 
will be occupied by the Home Econo

BASKETBALL SEASON TO CLOSE
Continued from Page 1 
the coming season and make the ap
portionment of home games in a like 
manner to our football schedule. 
Spread the games out throughout the 
season. It is a mighty hard task to 
play three games in one week. Alle
gheny and State probably never try 
it, while Pitt does it very infrequently, 
say only once in a season. To the 
writers mind, these should be the 
teams that should carry heavy sched
ules because they always have a 
wealth of material and it they do not 
carry out the policy, why should we 
do it at Tech?
So much for the schedule. Now as 
to the matter of coaching. It is prob
ably a very poor system to change 
coaches in the middle of a season: yet 
that is what happened at Tech, and 
the result of the change of system in 
mid-season has surely brought about 
disastrous consequences. As to the 
team and method of training. We 
have strict training rules in other 
sports and the men must live up to the 
law. The basketball team is just as 
representative of the schools as any 
other of our varsity teams and if a 
man is to play and represent his 
school, he must undoubtedly make sac
rifices and if he has not the spirit to 
make those sacrifices, he has no busi
ness on the team. This rule should 
go without exception and it is hoped 
that in future years it will be carried 
out in basketball as well as in all 
other sports. Taken all in all, this 
years team has been subject to much 
change; first it lost its captain; then 
its most reliable guard and then its 
coach; these are the difficulties that 
it had to undergo and these are the 
difficulties that have made this season 
one of the rockiest ever. The players 
have tried hard but the task as a whole 
has been too large to overcome. It 
is hoped that future teams have better 
luck.
Now to get back to the games. We 
play Bethany tonight and Marietta 
Saturday night, closing the season. 
Our representatives are going to do 
the darndest to win these two 
games. Now it is up to the student 
body to try and support them. At the 
last mid-week game against West Vir
ginia there was scarcely more than a 
hundred or a hundred and fifty at the 
contest. Not enough to give a good 
loud cheer. We have always been 
noted for our good spirit an3 loyalty 
to our teams. It is said we can sup
port a loser as well as the best; it is 
up to us to prove this statement. The 
team has been playing in much hard 
luck of late and deserve our support. 
So lets turn out for these last two 
games and fill those stands to their 
capacity. Lets show the team that
we are still with them. It will be 
your last chance to see the boys in 
action this season and in fact the last 
chance to ever see one of them per
form on the floor under Tech colors. 
Get out tonight and Saturday night, 
every loyal Techite, and show some 
of that spirit that has helped to dis
tinguish our school from all others. 
It is hoped that the Band will also 
contribute to this appeal and turn out 
in full force for at least once in the 
season.
The freshman physical examination 
at Cornell resulted as follows: 852
men have functional spinal curvature, 
441 wear glasses, 375 have enlarged 
tonsils, 125 suffer from goitre and 626 
have weak arches of the feet. The 
class is made up of 1500 men. Mili
tary drill is recommended as one of 
the best things to correct many of 
these weaknesses.
In 1880 the University of Kansas 
held a field meet. On the program 
were sack races, three-legged races, 
wrestling and archery. Later the list 
included egg races, vaulting, bicycle 
and wheelbarrow races, and obstacle 
races. College sports have changed 
greatly in the last thirty years.
The 'New York State College of 
Forestry at Syracuse University has

It will be the only building in the

EARLY BASEBALL PRACTICE
Continued from Page 1 
Pirate crew for the training grounds 
at Dawson Springs, Ky. A1 Wagner 
expects to take charge of Carnegies 
squad again early in April, after the 
Pirates have finished training. In the 
meantime, Mr. McCullough will be in 
charge of baseball practice.
We wonder whether or not those 
Plebes who insist upon coming into 
the meetings minus coats or plus shop 
jumpers have any conception of what 
it means to disregard school customs. 
Friend Hartman put it before the body 
in pretty good terms and we dont 
look for any further transgressions 
from our younger friends.
Trainer Smith, of the University of 
Maine, has established a precedent 
in training circles, for his latest idea 
is to teach his charges by means of 
moving pictures. I would no more 
think of coaching track athletes on 
my team without the movies, said 
Smith, than I would think of trying 
to teach them to fly. It teaches the 
proper form as well as detail in a race.
The time is coming when every 
athletic trainer in the country will be 
using the movies in coaching their 
charges.
Someone mentioned that the clubroom furniture needed repairs. So 
soon?
The Inter-class meet is to be held 
the first Saturday after the Easter 
vacation. The Plebes won the Connelley trophy last year. Everybody 
out.
The Plebe dance is .to be held 
Thursday, March 11th, in the Central 
Building, and the way arrangements 
are being completed the affair prom
ises to put the Plebe in the running 
with last years class for getting off 
some live stuff. Upper classmen are 
invited. Music will be furnished by 
Scalzos Orchestra.
A captain of the 1915 Northwestern 
University baseball team will be elect
ed by mail order, according to the 
coachs announcement. At the end 
of the baseball season last year there 
was a deadlock for the office, so let
ters will be sent to all members of 
last years squad and they will have 
another chance, in writing, to agree on 
a leader.
Great is the indignation of the stu
dents at the University of Washing
ton over a bill to be submitted to the 
State Legislature which advocates the 
abolition of intercollegiate sports. 
They characterize the action as 
freak legislation and cheap scheme 
to gain publicity. The director of 
physical training at the University 
said that intercollegiate athletics hurt 
the students in their development and 
advises that regular exercises be sub
stituted.
The question as to whether Colum
bia University is going to have a foot
ball team next season or not, is now 
probably decided in the affirmative.
Three hundred students have pledg
ed themselves to go out for the team, 
and 1,1000 have agreed to pay two 
dollars each to finance the start.
It is ten years since Columbia has 
had a football team.
Columbia University boasts of hav

secutive years. During this time, he 
has been granted five degrees. His 
annual income is $5,000 from the Uni

As a result of the mid-year exami

undergraduates, twenty-two more 
than a year ago and three more than 
the average of the past ten years. The 
greatest loss was in the sophomore 
class, with twenty-five flunks/' while 
the Freshmen had nineteen. The stu
dents who are studying for the de
gree of bachelor of letters lost fortyfour, while the bachelor of arts lost 
fourteen and the engineers eight. The 
losses by classes were: Seniors, 5;
juniors, 7; sophomores, 25; freshmen, 
19; qualifying and partial, 10.
Five Pennsylvania colleges and uni

Bucknell, Dickinson, Pennsylvania

Dartmouth is the latest colleg to

At McGill, four companies have

the monthly glass bills are consider

One of the most interesting and upto-date programs was given in the

The Recital given Friday afternoon 
by the students from the Department 
of Music, School of Applied Design, 
is worthy of remark in point of artis
tic performance.
The First Movement of the Piano 
Concerto by Hummel with Miss Zelda 
Beck at the first piano was the piece 
de resistance. Miss Beck plays with 
a viracity, sureness and style that is 
most satisfying to an audience. She 
also proved herself an accompanist of 
considerable ability in the Mozart 
Sonata for violin and piano. Mr. 
Cruso (violin) gave a very creditable 
performance.
In Beriots Serenade, Miss Monica 
Briggs made her initial bow before
the public, which always responds 
most cordially to the sentimental 
when expressed through the medium 
of the violin.
Mr. Bellingham made a favorable 
impression with his interpretation of 
Mlynarskis Mazurka in G.
The numbers, given by Mr. Horace 
Brown at both concerts, have hap
pened to be type where the appeal is 
largely intellectual and to say that he 
has given pleasure to his auditors 
through his careful and thoughtful 
performance of these compositions: 
Sphors Concerto for Violin No. 9 and 
Gades D minor Sonata, violin and 
pianomeans much. Mr. N. Robin 
revealed himself as a sympathetic ac
companist. We have a very pleasant 
recollection of his playing of the 
Beethoven Concerto for piano, on a 
former programme, January 21st, at 
which concert Mr. Samuel Gluck will 
be remembered to have given a de
lightful interpretation of Beethovens 
Romance for violin.
Art is long and time is fleeting, 
but the music department is beginning 
to get its head above water.
According to statistics in the Har
vard Quinquennial Catalogue, there 
are now 14,337 persons who hold one 
degree from Harvard, and 42 persons 
holding 7 degrees, 8 persons holding
10 degrees, two persons holding 18 
degrees, and one person holding 22 
degrees. Those degrees including all 
received from all institutions.
A mammoth track, with a four forty 
straightaway, is being built at San 
Francisco for the track meets to be 
held during the Exposition. Especial 
care is being taken in the construc
tion of the track, and it is said that it 
will be the fastest in the world. A 
grand stand seating 18,000 people will 
accompany the track.
An innovation at Wisconsin con
sists in amateur boxing matches be
tween halves of the basketball games. 
The disapproval which was expected 
to be voiced at the introduction of 
bouts of boxing in this way was not 
manifest at the Beloit-Wisconsin 
game, where a match was staged be
tween the halves. On the contrary, 
the audience grew enthusiastic over 
the antics of the boxers, and applaud
ed them with vigor.
Athletics, contrary to the enthusi
astic belief of many an alumnus, do 
not pull very strongly as a factor in 
attracting men to a particular college, 
provided, of course, one can believe 
the undergraduate in an introspective 
mood. A Dartmouth investigation 
showed only five men out of nearly 
four hundred who confessed that ath
letics brought them to Hanover. The 
influence of Dartmouth graduates and 
undergraduates was the largest fac
tor.
Williams Record states: Abraham 
Lincoln defined wealth as a super

Unquestionably he would have re
garded class athletic organizations at 
Williams as wallowing in affluence.

Last Saturday, at the Westinghouse 
Club, the Plaid was defeated by the 
team of that place by a 27-22 score. 
It was a hard game on a large floor 
and it was the same old story of too 
much work. The strenuous going of 
the night before against Pitt told 
on our boys and they weakened vis
ibly in the late stages of the second 
half. Tech led at the end of the first 
half and for about ten minutes of the 
second half when the pace began to 
tell and Westinghouse forged to the 
front and came under the wire a win
ner. Several sensational shots were 
registered by our opponents in the 
last few minutes of play. Harvey and 
Keeler played well for Westinghouse, 
while our boys all played alike, that 
is, with too much leg weariness.

Allegheny College has insured the 
weather for $5,000 during a part of 
the celebration of the one hundredth 
anniversary of the founding of the col
lege, to be celebrated at Meadville, 
Pa., during the week of June 19, by a 
pageant of 400 students, a gathering 
of noted educators from all over the 
world and distinguished statesmen, 
clergymen and alumni. For eight 
years the pageant has been planned. 
This is the first time in America, it is 
believed, this kind of insurance has 
been taken out. It was placed with 
Lloyds, of London, England, and if it 
rains on the three days set apart for 
the brilliant historical pageant, Lloyds 
will pay over $5,000 to the college au
thorities. The premium on this unique 
policy is paid out of a special guaran
tee fund subscribed by 50 of the 
alumni.
The pageant is to be given under 
the auspices of the alumni of the col
lege and is being arranged by Prof. 
George P. Baker, professor of dra
matic literature of Harvard Univer
sity, who Mill personally superintend 
its presentation. More than 400 stu
dents in historical costumes of the 
periods in American history since 1815 
will appear in the spectacle. Prof. 
Baker has written the book of the 
pageant, which will depict in chrono
logical order the high lights of the 
colleges career since its foundation.
By a curious coincidence on this 
centennial occasion there will be grad
uated just 100 students, the largest 
class ever turned out in any of the 
100 years of the colleges history. A 
feature of the week will be the laying 
of the cornerstone for the new Car
negie hall of chemistry. Andrew Car
negie will preside. During the week 
there will be a conference on the 
American College. It will be attended 
by and addressed by the presidents 
and leading professors of nearly all 
the American universities and col
leges. Problems of mutual and vital 
interest to the college of America as 
distinguished from the universities, 
will be discussed and acted upon. The 
universities of Europe will be repre
sented by M. Jusserand, French am
bassador to the United States.
Miss Ida M. Tarbell, the disting
uished American author and editor, a 
graduate of the college, will deliver 
an address, as will also Governor Mar
tin G. Brumbaugh, of Pennsylvania, 
and others. Class reunions, frat ban
quets, athletic events, illuminations 
and social functions will mark the 
occasion.Pittsburgh Sunday Post.
