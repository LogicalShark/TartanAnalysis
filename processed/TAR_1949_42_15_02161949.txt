VOL. 42No. 15CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 949
Dr. Edward Baker Named By 
Overend To Coach Grid Team
New Coach Will Sign Contract, Assume 
Duties After Executive Board Approval
Clarence (Buddy) Overend, Car
negie Techs veteran athletic di
rector, announced on February 1 
that he had selected Dr. Eddie 
Baker to take over the head foot
ball coaching vacancy. Baker will 
succeed Bill Donohoe who has re
signed the football and basketball 
coaching positions effective upon 
the completion of his current con
tract.
Overends choice still awaits the 
approval of the Executive Com
mittee of the Board of Trustees 
at their next meeting on Febru
ary 24. Upon this approval, Bak
er will be signed to a one year 
contract to commence with spring 
practice in April.
Names Assistant
Along with the announcement 
of Bakers selection came word 
that Eddie Hirshberg would be
come assistant coach. Another as
sistant will be named shortly.
For Baker it will be returning 
to old stamping grounds. The amiSays BertBert Munhall, former Tartan 
football trainer who has fol
lowed the ups and downs and 
inside and outside of the Car
negie athletic scene for the 
past 35 years, has passed on 
this bit regarding the appoint
ment of Baker:
He will at least know the 
ground on which he will tread, 
and there will be no reason in 
the world for the head gear not 
fitting their heads.
able doctor was Bill Kerns num
ber one assistant from 1937 until 
1940, molding the Tartan backfield that carried Carnegie into the 
1938 Sugar Bowl.
After Kern left Carnegie to 
take over the coaching position 
at West Virginia, Baker led the 
Plaid from 1940 to 1942. During 
this period he won 7 of 22 games, 
receiving most of his opposition 
irom selective service. It was al
so at the time when Carnegies 
de-emphasis program had affected 
the material but not the schedule. 
Such teams as Notre Dame, Pitt, 
Holy Cross, and Duquesne still 
dotted the schedule.
With Sutherland
Before coming to Carnegie in 
1937, Baker was Jock Sutherlands 
backfield coach at Pitt for six 
years. It was at Pitt and under 
Sutherland that Baker developed 
into an outstanding athlete while 
earning his dental degree.
From 1928 to 1930 he was the 
regular quarterback on three of 
Dr. Sutherlands great football 
juggernauts. A fine passer and 
runner, it was his football know
how that quarterbacked the Pan
thers into the Rose Bowl against 
Southern California in 1929.
He captained the 1930 team that 
handed Carnegie a 7-6 defeat in 
a game which many acclaim as 
one of the best in the lengthy ser
ies between the two schools.
Phi Kappa Phi 
Members Meet
Phi Kappa Phi, campus scholas
tic honorary, will hold a coffee 
hour reception at 4:30, February 
18, at the Carnegie Union. Old 
members and 75 new members 
will attend the organizations first 
social function of the year.
This meeting precedes the an
nual initiation banquet for new 
members, which will be held in 
approximately six weeks. Plans 
are as yet tentative for the affair.
Dr. Eddie Baker, Carnegie grid 
coach before the war, will return 
to the Skibo bowl when spring 
practice gets under way.
ODK Pledges 
Submit Papers
Essays To Discuss 
Campus Problems
Pledges of Omicron Delta Kap
pa, senior mens leadership and 
activities honorary, will submit 
their pledge projects during the 
next week. Used for the first time 
this year, the projects require the 
new member to inquire into a 
pertinent campus problem and 
suggest a well-founded solution.
Covering the entire gamut of 
campus problems, the papers to 
be submitted cover such diverse 
subjects as improvement of the 
football team, class organizations, 
reorganization of Student Coun
cil, the value of delayed frater
nity rushing, and the promotion 
of interest in the YMCA.
The outstanding essays among 
these projects will be printed in 
the Tartan as space permits.
It is expected that the pledge 
program of making serious analy
sis of some campus problem will 
be continued in future years.

Dormicom Plans Real Political Campaign;9 
Platform Promises Equitable Representation
A political campaign in every sense, promised Gerry Meyers 
as he revealed the Dormicom election platform last Sunday in the 
Dorm Bagpipers. The announcement from the independent leader 
broke the foreboding silence which prevailed over the political scene 
during the past week. However, 
the names of Dormicom candidates 
were not revealed. Dormicoms 
platform officially representing 
dorm residents, commuters, and 
other independents, is designed to 
achieve equitable representation 
in all activities, according to 
Meyers.
As yet no word has come from 
fraternity row, but Fred Lunt, a 
fraternity man and a possible can-r 
didate said, I welcome a real 
fight from the independents. I 
hope their enthusiasm and spirit 
doesnt die after the election as it 
has in the past, for it would be a 
great aid on the campus.
All Was Quiet 
Until Meyers statement was re
leased the political scene appear
ed surprising placid. The McGulp poll, which has been arous
ing curiosity if nothing else, claims 
that only two per cent of the stu
dents interviewed knew the date 
of the election but that an addi

least curious. However, the poll
Lasting F riendship Inspires 
Writing Of Original Portrait
By Bill Lyell
Twenty years ago when Lloyd Weninger, instructor of stage 
design in the drama department, met Stanley Zabaglo, maintenance 
man at CIT, a lasting friendship started from which was to grow 
one of the drama departments most interesting original plays.
From the very beginning of his* 
friendship with the Zabaglo fam
ily, Mr. Weninger had the nu
cleus of a play in minda play 
that the Zabaglo family was later 
to help him create. He roomed 
with the family for several years 
and was considered as one of 
them; he learned much of Polish 
customs, of Polish good will and 
full living; but it was not until 
almost two years ago that he actu
ally began work on 619. Por
trait of Polish Family.
All through the writing of 
Portrait, the Zabaglos helped 
by offering their interpretation of 
Polish temperament; they also 
contributed all the lines which 
are spoken in Polish. Once it was
completed, the Zabaglos anxious
ly watched Mr. Weningers script 
grow into a play.
Mr. Zabaglo often sits in during 
rehearsals helping both casts with 
the delivery of the Polish lines 
and showing them a few polka 
steps for the dance sequence.
Mr. Weninger painted the por
trait not as oils on canvas, but 
as words on stage: he treated it as 
an over all pattern done in 
sketches and a finished portrait.
On opening night, February 26, 
the Zabaglo family will be sure 
to be down front in the Carnegie 
theatre to see the unveiling of 
619. Portrait of Polish Family.

stantiated.
Dormicom, although it inherits 
the mantle of last years IAC, is a 
completely new organization. In 
contrast to IAC, which involved 
very few students, Meyers says 
that Dormicom is completely 
democratic. Achievement of com
plete satisfaction among party 
members was the cause of the de

dependent activity.

Editorials
Please-No Delay
One of the first tasks facing the new Council 
when it finally gets elected will be that of setting 
up a workable Publications committee. The con
stant hot water that almost all publications have 
found themselves in over the past year should 
serve as cause enough for prodding Council into 
taking definitive actionand soon.
Lee Wiley explains elsewhere in this issue 
his outline of the form which publication boards 
should take. The plan he proposes is sound, but 
it must be carefully and intelligently applied. 
It must be carried out thoughtfully by a Council 
group which is aware of publication problems 
and operation.
The job should be done speedily and it must 
be done well.
Whahoppen?
For the fourth time in its last six scheduled 
meetings, Student Council last week failed to 
gather a quorum. We almost wonder if that lit
tle news item deserves or requires any comment. 
Will it even raise any questions?
Pat On The Back
Too often, we feel, credit is given for good 
work only when that good work is about to 
cease, or has already ceased. And that is regret
table.
We would like to depart from custom and 
call the attention of our readers to the excep
tionally fine cartoons that appear in the Tartan 
week after week. Russ Kulberg is, in our judg
ment, one of the finest cartoonists drawing for 
college papers in this country. We feel sure he 
could put many a professional artist to shame.
Taking a complex or a vague idea, Russ reg
ularly delivers clean-cut, ingenious cartoons 
whose punch and life add zest to the entire 
paper. We wouldnt feel at home without Russs 
cartoons at the top of the page.
Deserving Of Credit
While it isnt every day that a school builds a 
cyclotron, we feel that Carnegie students may not 
realize just what a massive job is being done by 
Dr. Creutz and his associates in the physics de
partment. Nor do we feel that they realize the 
significance of the project and the leadership 
which is credited to Carnegie for its work in 
this highly complex and vital field.
Our hats are off to the efforts that have given 
every Carnegie student something of which he 
can be proud.
Why Not?Voice Of 
The People
Editor, the Tartan:
The present organization of the 
Publications committee is totally 
worthless. The committee fails 
completely to function as a repre
sentative of Student Council to 
the publications.
Only one Student Council mem
ber, the Publications chairman, is 
in a position to know anything of 
the affairs of a publication and 
obviously he alone cannot be 
familiar with all publications. Fur
ther, an editor or business man
ager cannot be expected to know 
the workings of other publications 
well, or to criticize other editors 
or business managers.
We need a new organization 
badly. The recent occurrences 
within the Scottie staff and the 
Tartan incident of last year indi
cate clearly the incapability of the 
present organization to handle 
natural and frequent problems 
which require intervention by 
Student council. At the present 
there is no means of either fore
seeing the development of such 
situations or of handling them ef
fectively.
The proposed Editorial Board 
of two Student Council members, 
[Continued on page 3]
CIT-Chat
By Jack Johnson
The world has been deprived of many good 
ideas for lack of good salesmen to push them, and 
Carnegie Tech probably suffers from the same ill.
Multitudes of student ideas are never accepted 
because of improper or inadequate presentation. 
Rejected when first offered, these ideas are often 
lost due to the frustration and bitterness of the 
person who offers them.
These Alternatives
Either the student assumes that he was tact
less and short-sighted or, as is much more com
mon, he assumes that the person to whom he 
proffered the idea is a retrogressive, stubborn 
brute. Unfortunately, the latter attitude is often 
substantiated by appearances. In most cases, 
neither conclusion is fully justified.
Why do such rebuffs seem to occur so of
ten? Suggestions have been presented to allevi
ate such campus problems as parking space, eat
ing facilities, Saturday classes and others which 
are constantly under the fire of student critics.
The straightforward reason for no apparent 
progress in such situations is that no one has been 
able to come up with a realistic solution to con
vince the proper people in the administration. 
Basic Method $There is a rather basic plan one can follow 
to assure that an idea will get the consideration 
you wish it to have. To begin with, find out 
where to take the idea. Taking it to the wrong 
person not only serves to waste your time and 
his but also it may serve to kill your interest 
in the problem.
If there is any doubt of the proper place to 
present the idea, the Dean of Mens office is 
easily accessible to everyone and can always sup
ply this information.
Once you know where to take a suggestion, 
take time to collect all the available facts deal
ing with the problem. Work out a method for 
presentation including some of the realistic de
tails which must be considered before putting 
the plan into operation.
Plan Your Conversation
The person to whom the idea is presented 
is probably very busy, so dont leave the move
ment of th conversation to chance. Guide the 
conversation so that you bring up only the per
tinent points.
Even when the^e steps are followed, you may 
still expect almost any reception ranging from 
immediate acceptance to violent rejection. How
ever, if your idea isnt immediately embraced, 
dont quit. Find out why, reorganize, and have 
another go at it with a revised plan. If the idea 
is worth presenting in the first place, its worth 
seeing through.
This scheme may be applied to many situa
tions when college days are nothing but nostal
gic memories. Its a workable plan to use in show
ing a small boy how to hold a baseball bat or 
in writing a letter to your senator.

the Publications chairman, and the 
editor and business managerone 
board for each publicationcould 
handle these things. The board 
would be a representative of Stu
dent Council to the publication 
and of the publication to Student 
Council (and any other outside 
organization with which the pub
lication must deal.)
It would not interfere with the 
internal working of the publica
tion, but would see that stated and 
expected policy were adhered to. 
And it would aid the staff by de
fining what is expected and re
quired. Student Council could 
understand, and thus handle much 
better, any problems which arose.
The Editorial Board system is 
surely not perfect, but it seems 
by far the best answer. It would 
put publications on a clear and 
open basis and it would, with the 
aid of the proposel Board of Ap
peal, be capable of handling any 
problems which arose  without 
the need for administration or 
special committee action.

Graduates And Seniors Eligible 
For Commissions In Army
Colonel Harold A. Kurstedt has announced that Regular Army 
commissions as second lieutenants are being offered to college gradu
ates and seniors who will graduate this spring and who served 
as commissioned officers in any of the armed forces during World 
War II. +-
In addition to those selected 
from senior division ROTC units 
and other special sources, some 
400 to 600 second lieutenants 
will be appointed in increments 
during March and August, 1949.
To be eligible, candidates must 
be graduates of accredited col
leges or universities, between the 
ages of 21 and 27, with at least 
one year of honorable, active, 
commissioned service in any com
ponent of the armed forces be
tween December 7, 1941 and
September 2, 1945, physically
qualified, and of high moral char
acter. Besides being free of any 
major military or civil court con
victions, the applicant must not 
be a conscientious objector nor a 
member of any organization ad
vocating subversive policy.
Upon notification, applicants 
will appear before army inter
view boards, from which results 
will be forwarded to the Adju
tant-General in Washington.
Applications must be submitted 
not later than April 30, 1949. 
Forms for application and more 
detailed information are available 
in the office of Colonel Kurstedt.
Photographers
Any underclassmen, particu
larly freshmen and sophomores, 
who are interested in news 
photography and who have 
their own developing equip
ment are invited to join the 
staff of the Tartan. All those 
interested should write to the

Council Meets Fifth 
Time Without Quorum
Lack Of Attendance No Hindrance 
To Work Of Special Committees
Disinterested Council, as the present governing body has been 
aptly dubbed, was again dismissed early last week for lack of a 
quorum. This meeting was the fifth quorumless assembly of Coun
cil since the group took office last September and the fourth in 
the last six meetings.
that any changes made will be for 
clarification and consistency only. 
A thorough job from the com
mittee is expected to prevent 
such useless delays and sessions 
of bickering as occurred over the 
election.
By reorganizing the structure 
of the various Council committees, 
Councilmen Hall and Fockler are 
aiming to make the Council mem
bers more aware of their duties. 
They believe that the present dif
ficulties are encountered because 
many members do not understand 
what is happening in Council and 
are not familiar with the prob
lems that face the campus.
The next Council must also re
organize the Publication com
mittee and establish a new Scottie 
staff for the coming year. The 
present structure of the publica
tions committee was blamed for 
the Scotties death. Councilman 
Wiley, publications committee 
chairman, stated that a well or
ganized committee could have pre
vented the incident.
By-Laws Still Unratified
One of the pieces of unfinished 
business that will confront the 
new Council is the ratification of 
the bylaws. They were informally 
approved early last fall by a ma
jority vote but still have not gone 
into effect.
Councils usefulness does not 
look as dim for the future as it 
did in the past, however. Both 
the committee for reorganization 
of Council and the committee ap
pointed to correlate the Constitu
tion and bylaws are at work to 
remove the deficiencies that have 
so greatly handicapped Council.
Begin Reorganization
Councilman Meyers, chairman 
of the correlation committee, re
ports that work has been started 
but nothing is available for offi
cial release as yet. He has stated

Paul Offermanns'
Selection of Dr. BakerSportscopeBring*1SewHopes ToCIT Football Scene
So you think the Carnegie football situation is hopeless 
and who hasnt at one time or another during the past few 
years? Well, here is one remedynot for the conditions pre
vailing, but at least for your pessimism: a short talk with Dr. 
Eddie Baker, the new football coach.
You need only a few minutes with the doctor and youre 
sure of two things: he knows what he is stepping into and 
he has the necessary personality for such a job.
Last week, Grantland Ricewho has attained somewhat 
of a title as a sports authority during the past few decades 
came out with the all-important characteristic of personality 
and how it relates to coaching.
As Rice so aptly pointed out, the big-game coach is fad
ing out of the college football scene. Schools all over the coun
try are beginning to realize that modern day football demands 
the emphasis to be placed on materialnot the coaching staff.
When it comes to selecting a coach today most athletic 
directors are looking for personalitythe ability of a coach 
to handle his team and get the most playing strength possi
ble out of them.
In passing oyer the seventy-five or more applicants he 
received for the job, Buddy Overend certainly came up with 
a prize selection in Dr, Baker.
Odds and endsThe AP basketball ratings may not show 
it, but Carnegies basketball team carved its name in glory 
last Saturday when they swamped Case. By working back we 
find that Case upended Western Reserve, who in turn defeated 
Oberlin. Oberlin turned beak Buffalo two nights after that 
team tacked an upset loss on to Niagara. Niagara knocked off 
Canisius, which holds wins over several big-name teams. One 
of these teams is Denver, who defeated the Phillips Oilers 
earlier in the season. The Oilers in turn have defeated Ken
tucky, the number one team in the country.
There also seems to be a rumor going around about a 
Slippery Rock swimmer. In fact wTe are still wondering if 
one of the winning teams star swimmers enrolled at the school 
the day of their meet with Carnegieor was it the day be 
fore? And where is the strong hand of the NCAA?
Dr. Baker Clarifies Position 
On Next Years Foothall Policy
Dr. Eddie Baker is pulling no punches in making clear his posi
tion on the football coaching policy which he will use next year 
at Carnegie.
The tall, good-looking doctor, husky and looking fit enough to
don a football suit himself, said4------------------------------------- ---------
that he was very happy about re
turning to the school where he 
has so many good friends.
I understand perfectly well the 
situation under which football is' 
being played at Carnegie, he 
said. I certainly would not re
turn if I thought the case was 
hopeless.
Rebuild Spirit
He emphasized that he was go
ing to concentrate on rebuilding 
the spirit of the squad, which he 
thought was badly lacking in. a 
game he witnessed late last sea
son. I want only players who 
love football and are willing to 
work hard; we will have no loaf
ers this year. You cant build a 
good and spirited team without 
working at it.
As an example of what spirit 
means to a team he pointed to 
his 1942 team at Carnegie which 
had a line that didnt average any 
more than 180 and a backfield 
that weighed in at 150. Yet, 
the doctor pointed out, we held 
Pitt even at 6-6 for three quar
ters before they scored two lastquarter touchdowns to win; we 
did that on spirit.
When the question of practice 
time was brought up, the former 
Pitt star said that he wants as 
much time as he can possibly get.
He said that he knew of several 
schools in CITs class of football 
that start practice at three in the

Plaid Hits 
All-Time High 
In Fifth Win
Theodore Scores 26 
In 75-48 Rout
In their most impressive show
ing of the current campaign Car
negie Techs basketball quintet 
rolled to an easy, 75-48 victory 
over a rangy Case Institute 
squad at the Skibo gym last Sat
urday night.
Records fell by the wayside as 
the Tartan five methodically 
pounded out their fifth victory of 
the year at the expense of the 
visiting Roughriders. With Mike 
Theodore leading the way with 
26 points the Plaid broke their 
own single game scoring record 
of 72 established in last seasons 
Grove City encounter.
Coming on the heels of the St. 
Vincent win, the contest also 
marked the first time that the lo
cal team has been able to win two 
consecutive victories.
Carnegie took an early lead on 
the first of Joe Matseys field 
goals and then put on a display 
of sharpshooting that kept them 
well in front throughout the game. 
Coach Bill Donohoes charges 
dropped through 41 per cent of 
their 78 attempts from the floor 
although they were unable to net 
more than 11 of their 22 free 
throws. Theodore himself set the 
pace with 10 successes out of his 
19 shots. The Tartan scoring ace 
restrained himself very noticeably 
at times as he passed off numerous 
clear openings at the basket.
Carnegie was in danger of be
ing ovetraken only once midway 
in the first quarter when a brief 
lapse of accuracy allowed the vis
itors to narrow the margin to two 
points. It was only a matter of 
time, however, until the Plaid 
found the range again as Matsey 
and Theodore poured through 
four rapid field goals to widen the 
gap. A lead of 16 points at half 
time was never cut down as the 
Tartan basketeers won the contest 
going away.
J. Paul Sheedy* Switched to Wildroot Cream-0il 
Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test
WHEN a camels hair coat company refused Sheedy as a gift 
he went all to pieces. It was a blow thatd break an ordinary 
camels backbut not his! He remembered hearing about 
the Finger-Nail Test . . . tried it . . . and hot-footed for a 
bottle of Wildroot Cream-Oil. Now you wouldn't know the 
old boy! His hair has a snappy, well-groomed look. No more 
of that old dryness and loose, ugly dandruff! He the hit of 
every caravan!
Even if youre not a camelyou, too, should be using non
alcoholic Wildroot Cream-Oil containing Lanolin. You needn't 
walk a mile for ityour nearest drug store has it in bottles 
and tubes.. And your barber can give you a 
application. Get some today!

Tight Races In All Leag ues
With the intramural basketball teams having played only two 
or three of the eight games scheduled for each entry, the league 
championships are still very much in doubt. The teamsin all three 
leagues are tightly bunched with no one team holding a distinct lead.
In the hard-playing American^------------ ____________________
league, there is a three-way tie 
for first place. Emanon A, 
Kappa Sigma A and Freshman 
Architects each have two wins 
and no losses. In a tie for second 
honors are the Stanley Steamers 
and Beta Theta Pi. No. 1 with an 
equal number of wins but with 
one game each in the loss column.
Theta Xi is in undisputed pos
session of the Federal league lead 
with three victories and no de
feats while trailing behind in a 
three-way tie for second place are 
Beta Theta Pi. No. 2, TNT A 
and ASCE, each with two wins 
and no defeats.
The Big Five and TNT B 
teams are deadlocked in first place 
in the National league, each team 
having won two games. Close be
hind with two victories and one 
defeat each, Delta Upsilon, Alpha 
Tau Omega, and Citcom Clan are 
battling it out for second place in 
another three-way tie.
With the post-vacation renewal 
of intramural basketball, the 
gaps between the teams will be
gin to widen as several important 
games are played within the next 
few weeks.
In the American league on Februay 22 KS A plays the Stan

Emanon A and Freshman Arch

Beta No. 2 opposes TNT A

afternoon ana finish at seven in 
the evening.
The Sugar Bowl team, of which 
he was backfield coach, had a sixweek spring practice and then re
turned to school three or four 
weeks early to start a concen
trated practice period in the fall.
Dr. Baker commented that he 
is satisfied with the 5:00 to 6:45 
practice sessions that the Tartans 
utilized after last season was half 
over. However, he would like to 
start indoor chalk drills and prac
tice running through plays imme
diately after the basketball sea
son is finished in March. After 
Easter vacation he would like to 
move outdoors for two weeks of 
outside work.
The system of offense which
Baker intends to use this year 
is known as a winged T or a cock
eyed T. Basically it is a single 
wing blended with a T. He in
tends to stress speed and decep
tion with a good passing attack.
In modern day football, the 
doctor said, you must have a 
good passing attack. One of my 
big problems is going to be geting a good passer and some re
ceivers.
Impressed By Line
Commenting on last years 
team, he said that he was im
pressed by the heavy line, and is 
glad that all but three of last 
years squad are returning. On 
the backfield, he said that he is 
always partial to fellows who 
can run.
Baker will handle all of the 
backs, while Hirshberg and the 
other assistant will drill the linemen. The doctor was high in his 
praise of Hirshberg.
