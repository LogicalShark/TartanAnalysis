Carnegie down Westminster on Tech 
Field Saturday afternoon in a fast and 
interesting game by the score of 5 to
2. The home team was hitting well 
and often, but poor base-running kept 
the score down and prevented the New 
Wilmington boys from being 
swamped.
Ryan went the nine innings for Tech 
and pitched a good game. He held 
the visitors to one hit in five innings, 
then loosened up for two singles. Un
fortunately for him, the team back of 
him selected the same inning to let 
down the bars on the close fielding 
that they had been giving and a couple 
of bad foozles allowed the two runs 
that were the portion of their oppo
nents.
Auerswald led the work at the bat 
with four solid hits in as many times 
at bat, two being good for three bases 
each. Besides his hitting, he played 
a star game at shortstop, accepting 
five hard chances successfully and 
throwing away but one. His sidepartner, Brine, also fielded his posi
tion finely, making one catch that took 
him off his feet. In the outfield, 
Kreider and McDonald shared honors. 
The latter went in for Fulmer in the 
seventh, and in the final round started 
a double play that finished the chances 
for Westminster. With a man on sec
ond, McDonald gathered in a long fly 
and returned the ball to third in time 
to allow Brine to put the runner out 
at that station.
Carnegie started their hitting at the 
very beginning. Kreider, the first 
man up, sent a hard drive to deep 
middle for two bases and scored on a 
single by Fulmer.
Again in the third inning, Carnegie 
scored another run. Fulmer was hit 
by the pitcher and went to second 
when Acheson dropped Brines_ fly. 
Black decided he had had enough and 
retired in favor of Mercer. With Ful
mer on third and Brine on second, 
Lain hit to Igo, who cut Fulmer off 
at the plate. A balk by Mercer forced 
in Brine with the second run for Car
negie.
In the Westminster half of the sixth, 
with one down, K. Igo singled over 
second and advanced on Stratherns 
single to left. Oeffinger threw over 
Humphreys head and Igo scored. 
Humphrey returned the ball to Lain 
to try for Igo and the catcher threw

Under ideal weather conditions, Car
negie defeated Allegheny College in 
a dual track meet at Meadville last 
Saturday afternoon. The final score 
of 66 to 60 indicates the closeness of 
struggle which was not definitely de
cided until the last event. Tech 
jumped into the lead at the start when 
Hemmann won the 100 yard dash, and 
was never headed. The points stood 
55 to 53 in our favor with the half mile 
and broad jump still to be run off. 
Haselton then proceeded to break the 
schools half mile record made six 
years ago, lowering the mark from 
2:04 3-5 to 2:04 minutes. MacMillan 
finished a good second and Techs 
count was raised to 63, while Alle
gheny had 54. This made defeat im
possible, but the chances for a tie 
were not improbable for our oppon
ents threatened to make a clean sweep 
in the jump. Our fears were allayed 
however, when Patterson and Wright 
qualified with two Allegheny men for 
the finals since the points were given 
for three places. Patterson of Tech 
was the last jumper and before taking 
his final leap, both of the Blue and 
Gold entrants were ahead of him. And 
merely to make an exciting meet more 
exciting, Pat closed it by placing 
second with a jump just one-half inch 
better than that of Fahr of Allegheny.
In addition to the new mark set 
by Haselton, three others were made. 
Captain C. M. Dotterer of Allegheny 
broke the Western Pennsylvania in
tercollegiate record in the shot-put 
with a heave of 42 feet 11 3-4 inches, 
while his teammate Fahr, lowered his 
own school marks in both hurdle 
races, running the high hurdles in 
16 2-5 seconds and the low hurdles 
in 28 1-5 seconds. This same fellow, 
Fahr, was the star of the meet. Be
sides the two firsts already mentioned, 
he won the 440-yard dash and took 
third place in the broad jump for a 
total of 16 points. He was closely 
followed by his captain, who annexed 
13 points in the weight events. For 
Tech, both Haselton and Hemmann 
scored 10 points, with two wins apiece. 
King, who completed in three events 
and placed in every one, made 9; while 
Capt. Clair and MacMillan each regis
tered 8 counts. All of the other mem
bers of the Plaid team acquitted them
selves most creditably and repaid the 
coach for the confidence he placed in 
them'.

The Schenley Oval will be the scene 
of a dual attraction next Saturday af
ternoon. While the Varsity will be 
matching its strength against West
minster, the prep schools of this dis
trict will be struggling for supremacy 
in the annual interscholastic track and 
field meet under Carnegies auspices. 
The Plaid management is making 
elaborate preparations for the host of 
athletes that are expected to compete. 
Practically every secondary school in 
Western Pennsylvania and Eastern 
Ohio and some from West Virginia 
will be represented. Entries from 
Cleveland Central High School, New 
Castle High School, Rayen High 
School, Greensburg High School, and 
Washington High School are among 
many that have been received from 
towns outside of Pittsburgh, while all 
the local high schools and academies 
will compete for the handsome cup 
that will be given to the winning 
team'. In the individual events, gold, 
silver, and bronze medals will be 
awarded the winners of first, second, 
and third places, respectively. A list 
of competent officials has been ar
ranged and most of the men have sig
nified their intention of serving.
From the showing of the Varsity 
track team against Allegheny, it should 
encounter little trouble in defeating 
Westminster. Manager Miller is of
fering a cup to the winner and Tech 
hopes to land another trophy for its 
trophy case.

On Wednesday morning, Uncle 
Andy visited the schools and gave a 
short talk to the entire student body 
assembled in the Design School Thea
tre. He visited the Library and Insti
tute before coming to the schools and 
he delivered a short talk to the assem
bled librarians there. He was late in 
arriving at the theatre and in the 
meantime a very remarkable musical 
program was given by the students. 
Several solos were given by Miss Wil
liams and Miss Smail of the M. M.
C. S., McNulty of the Industries, and 
our friend Tommy. Miss Stoner 
assisted Mr. McDowell, who led the 
singing.
Mr. Carnegie was introduced by Di
rector Hamerschlag. A broad smile 
beamed across the ironmasters coun
tenance ps he started to speak. He 
said, in part:
Ladies and gentlemen, just before 
I arrived here I was over at the li
brary, where I addressed the young 
ladies. They presented a pleasing 
picture as they sat before me all 
dressed in white. I called them angels, 
and angels they are. All women are 
angels. Yes, I know they are. I have 
come in contact with the widows of 
the railroaders, the telegraphers, the 
steelworkers that were under me, and 
the wives of the pensioners. I have 
seen the acts of kindness they have 
performed and the sacrifices they have 
made. They are angels in every sense 
of the word.
And now what about the men? 
the laird continued. I have something 
good to say about them, too. Now, 
dont smile, girls. The men are be
coming better every day. The longer
I live the more improvement I see in 
mankind. There has been a marked 
development in man during the last 
few generations. Scan the pages of 
history and see what atrocities he has 
committed in centuries gone by. Com
pare their deeds with those of today.
Each generation is becoming more 
happy. You were all made to be hap
py and the amount of happiness we 
enjoy depends largely upon ourselves. 
You do not have to worry about the 
future. If you can obey the judge 
within you need not be afraid of any 
judge you will face. My advice to you, 
young men and women, is to obey the 
judge within you and you will not 
have to fear about the future.

LOOKING AHEAD.
It often happens, in reading over 
the exchanges from the various other 
universities in this country, that we 
come across an especially valuable 
editorial. The following is one from 
The Daily Texan, a most enterpris
ing daily paper at the University of 
Texas. Though written primarily for 
students at that institution, it is equal
ly applicable to other college men, and 
for that reason we wish to reprint it 
in The Tartan. We trust it will re
ceive the consideration it deserves, es
pecially from the under-classmen.
If you would succeed in your col
lege career you must learn to look 
ahead. As in the world around you, 
so it is in college circles. The man 
who succeeds is the man who looks 
ahead, sets his ambition on some par
ticular thing, and then strives inces
santly for the accomplishment of that 
thing.
Those of you who entered the Uni
versity last fall have been here long 
enough to have your bearings. If you 
have been at all observant, you are 
now in a position to decide what you 
want to accomplish while here. And 
there is no reason why any freshman 
with ordinary skill and ability can not, 
with proper and timely application, 
have any office or position within the 
gift of the student body. Decide your 
first year what you want, and then 
work to that end.
But as to whether you accomplish 
anything at all in your college career 
depends primarily on your conception 
and acceptation of the real purpose of 
a college education. If you are here 
just because you are here, if you are 
bent on having a good time, if you 
are content with making your
courses, if you are pleased to be 
known as one who can work the fac
ulty,if you measure your success by 
the amount of college life that you 
can contain without busting then 
you will succeed, but your success will 
be measured in its own terms. If, on 
the other hand, you realize that you 
are here to work, to accomplish some
thing, to make a good record, to live 
up to the hopes of your parentsto 
learn how to livethen you will suc
ceed, and your success will be meas
ured by the same standard that ob
tains in the world outside.
Observation constrains us to re
mark that too large a number of this 
years freshmen are succeeding, and 
succeeding gloriously  measured, 
however, by the first standard. Ev
ery day we are brought in contact 
with those who are going through 
school with no serious purpose in view 
they are just here,and if you 
chance to investigate their scholarship 
you will find they just are here. 
Just so often as we meet one of these 
worthless creatures we wonder why 
they are permitted to livebut then 
we think of the weeds, and yield to 
the superior judgment of the Creator. 
But it does us good to find a freshman 
now and then who is really bent on 
accomplishing something. We do not 
see him so oftennot that he is so 
scarce; in fact, he is in the majority 
because he is at work and not seen in 
public places.
By now you have fallen into one 
of these classes. If we had warned 
you about the first class last fall, you 
would have paid no attentionand 
quite likely you will pay even less 
nowbut perhaps we can reassure 
some who are in the second class, and 
let them know that they are the ones 
and the only ones who will ever suc
ceed in school.
Regardless, however, of what you 
have accomplished or failed to accom
plish this year, there is still time for 
you to catch a vision of what you 
should be in your senior yearand 
then to keep your eyes ahead.

The premiere of The School of 
Drama of Applied Design was antici
pated with considerable interest by the 
student body, more particularly as 
nearly all departments had a finger in 
the pie; the scenery being designed 
and painted by the illustrators and dec
oratorsthe costumes designed by a 
member of the faculty, and done by 
the M. M. C. S. girls under direction 
of Miss Stannardthe music contrib
uted by the students of The Depart
ment of Music and the programmes 
the product of the Tech Press; where
fore everyone was on the qui vive and 
right proud are they of this latest 
member of the Design Family 
which is so artistically domiciled.
Envy became admiration as the as
tonishing result of three months 
work revealed itself in the perform
ance given to the students Friday 
evening
The first thing that struck the spec
tator, on entering this miniature Play 
House, was the color scheme with its
instant appeal to the aesthetic sense, 
its softness and blend of tone; and 
when the curtain rose the effect was 
heightened as the eye rested only on 
colors which seemed to rise out of their 
surroundingsthe scenery and cos
tuming having a harmony unusual 
even in the best theatrical productions. 
Those having this part of the work in 
hand are to be congratulated on the 
happy result.
Considering all circumstances at
tending the putting on of this Shake
spearian production and the handicap 
under which much of it was done, the 
entire cast may be said to have ac
quitted itself creditably and with 
promise for the future; while two call 
for special mention, the Julia of Miss 
Doris Williams, and the Proteus of 
Mr. C. Steen, the reading of their lines 
being considerably above the average.
Proteus was just a trifle stiff, one 
felt he was afraid his make-up might 
crack if he gave way to any facial ex
pression. Valentine was less auto
matic and therefore more convincing, 
while the robbers were the most gen
tlemanly ever seen on any stage. Syl
vias distress, in the hands of these 
desperate men, was in perfect accord 
with their repressed and mannerly 
conduct.
Let us not overlook Launce and his 
dog. The dog was to the manner 
bornin truth, a very proper dog, 
while the minor wails of Launce will 
linger long in the memory.
Then there was the Dukebut his 
dignity discourages criticism.
The garden scene was one of the 
most attractive to which the music 
added its charm.
The entire production was charac
terized by the absence of glare and 
newness which generally greets the 
eye in a new theater. The cast, if 
anything, was too obviously cautious, 
but may be commended for its self
repression and the lack of ranting 
which so often mars romantic acting 
in the hands of more experienced 
players.
There was nothing to offend the 
artistic sense and those having the 
production under their direction may 
feel that it was a success beyond ex
pectation.

We have elsewhere announced the 
program for the second annual con
ference of the Middle Atlantic Asso
ciation of School and College Editors. 
The first conference was held last 
year at the University of Pittsburgh, 
and the results were so gratifying that 
this years meeting has been arranged, 
and will be held at the same institu
tion. The guests from out of town 
colleges will be entertained by the 
Pitt students and fraternities.
We believe these conferences to be 
most profitable to those participating. 
As will be noted from the program, 
questions of vital interest to the 
school papers and likewise to the stu
dent bodies, are discussed by the lead
ing college journalists, and then 
thrown open to general round-table

CollUNsCaMsoNy.
Pittsburgh, Pa., May 1, 1914.
Mr. Chas. E. Gilson,
Editor-in-Chief,
The Tartan.
Dear Sir:
My withdrawal from' school makes 
it necessary for me to sever my con
nection with The Tartan. I therefore 
offer my resignation for the approval 
of the Board.
During the time in which I have 
served as a member of the editorial 
staff I have acquired many pleasant 
associations and an invaluable experi
ence in the manifold phases of college 
life as followed by Carnegie Tech stu
dents. I may sincerely say that the 
last year under your direction has been 
most pleasant and profitable to me.
I wish to express to the Board my 
appreciation of the work and leader
ship of the present editor-in-chief. The 
constant and rapid growth of the In
stitute, with the many changes in con
ditions that become necessary, force 
a progressive policy upon every lead
er in every activity of student life. 
Mhe school paper must always be a 
step in advance of every movement, 
leading the progressive policies by 
suggestion, demand, or exhortation. 
For this reason, the editor-in-chief of 
The Tartan holds a specially difficult 
position. He must have tact, strength 
of character, cool judgment, and a 
broad view-point of every question 
that presents itself for his consider
ation. He must assume the attitude 
of a critical alien to college life, yet 
maintain his sympathies with the citi
zens of his world. He must not be in
fluenced by unjust criticism, but must 
recognize and respect honest and help
ful judgment. And, besides his poli
cies, he must influence and control his 
staff of editors and reporters.
I am glad to be able to say that Mr. 
Gilson fulfills all of these conditions, 
and has continued the leadership in 
student activities that rightly belong 
to the Tartan. I wish to express my 
personal gratitude to him for his aid 
in my work during the past year.
My thanks also go to the business 
manager, Mr. Kelcey, and to his staff 
for the willingness with which they 
carried rut every suggestion for the 
improvement of the athletic depart
ment.
It gives me great pleasure to be 
able to give my assistant, Mr. Rauh, 
my heartiest recommendations for the 
position of athletic editor, which I am
vacating. He possesses marked abil
ity in handling stories of athletic 
events, understands the various sports 
thoroughly, and has an insatiable ca
pacity for work which will be his 
most useful quality in the times when 
the athletic staff must fill two-thirds 
or more of the column space in the 
p?per,as c ccasionally happens.
To the remainder of the staff, I 
wish to express my pleasure in hav
ing been associated with them in the 
period ir> which we have worked to
gether, and my regret that the asso
ciation must be broken.
Few of the students realize the im
portant part which the college paper 
plays in their career, otherwise they 
would show an increased interest in 
the publication. The leaders in the 
Institute, I am glad to say, fully rec
ognize that the paper serves not only 
as a record of what is past and a mir
ror of present events, but also fills 
the purpose of a mystic crystal which 
suggests,dimly perhaps, or clearly, 
the future of the college, in days, 
and even years,to come. Just how 
far this prescience is to extend de
pends upon the student body them
selves. If their interest in the future, 
or even in the present, were in
creased to that point which a few 
hold, the scope of the view would be 
limitless. Unfortunately, it is impos
sible to get every individual fully 
awakened to his responsibilities, and 
the few must continue to suggest and 
shape the destinies of the school and 
its institutions.
However, I sincerely hope that the 
future will bring to The Tartan the 
recognition on the part of the student 
body that it deserves. May the same 
future hold for and give to each mem
ber of the present staff the best things 
of life.
Yours sincerely,
C. BENTON KLINE.
.d.It is with great regret that we 
are forced to accept the resignation 
of Mr. Kline. For the last four years 
he has been connected with The Tar
tan, and during that time has faith
fully served the interests of the school 
and the paper. The present growth 
of the paper is due in no small meas
ure to his indefatigable energy; the 
excellence of the athletic department 
of The Tartan has been achieved sole
ly by him. As a Board, we wish to 
thank Mr. Kline for his labors, and 
in accepting his resignation, we pay 
full tribute to his marked ability.

Director A. A. Hamerschlag:
Friday, April 24, 1914.
Let me tender my hearty congratu
lations, on the complete success of 
Shakespears birthday play. I think 
Pittsburgh may well be proud of the 
dramatic results as developed by the 
School of Applied Design. The Thea
ter, unique in conception, and beauti
ful in architectural design, and orna
mentation, is a study for the most ad
vanced in dramatic interest.
We are indebted to you for a most 
delightful entertainment.
Sincerely,
MV. aLUlNs ayyoCsaMsoN.
The greatest asset that a school may 
have is a strong Alumni. It is there
fore with great interest that we watch 
the development of the Alumni Asso
ciations. The progress that they have 
made during the past year both in 
numbers and influence is nothing short 
of marvelous. The different parts of 
the country are divided into districts 
and the members in these districts 
meet at different intervals and discuss 
the affairs that are going on here at 
school. At the first meeting of the 
New Castle District at Youngstown 
thirteen members were present. The 
graduates of the Schools at Westinghouse, meet frequently. So it is with 
other districts. Although the men 
may not be able to get to Pittsburgh, 
they are always in touch with the As
sociation and with the Schools.

Carnegie Visits the Schools
Continued from Page 1
I am going to call your attention to 
a passage of Scripture, which I think 
is one of the most important in the 
Book of Truths. It isThe kingdom 
of Heaven is within you. I am afraid 
that too many of our ministers do not 
place enough emphasis upon this pass
age. The kingdom1 is not up there, 
down there, over there or over here, 
but the kingdom of Heaven is within 
you.
I am beginning to think that there 
is more religion in some of the works 
of the poets than in some of the pass
ages of the Old Testament. You find 
much religion in some of the verses 
of Shakespeare and Burns. They 
teach us to become better men.
I am getting old, Carnegie said. 
I am' older than when I was here 
before. I would like to stay here as 
long as I want to. Now that is not 
wishing too much, is it, boys and girls? 
Now, how many of you here would

old friend, Dr. John Brashear, without 
paying him a tribute. John Brashear 
is a great man, Carnegie said. I 
have known him a good long time. I 
knew him when he was toiling in the 
mills and knew him when he began 
his career with the stars. Why, he is 
so closely connected with the stars 
that sometimes his feet are off the

The most important as well as the 
most interesting feature of the weekly 
meeting of the Student Assembly of 
the School of Applied Industries, 
April 29th, was the presentation of the 
Dean Connelly Trophy to the Lower 
Class, the winners of the inter-class 
athletic meet. The presentation speech 
was made by Dean Connelly, and the 
award was accepted by President 
Parker on behalf of the class of 1916.
The trophy is a large silver shield 
on a black background. It is set off 
by three miniature athletes, hand
somely cut and mounted in silver. The 
engraving is exquisitely done. It 
reads as follows:
Dean Connelly Trophy 
Awarded Winners of 
Annual Inter-Class Athletic Meet

Winners.
1913-1914 Class of 1916.
For the time the trophy will be kept 
in a glass case in the club room' until 
more suitable quarters are secured.
Following the hearty enthusiasm re
sulting from the award of the trophy, 
the Assembly voted to go to the ath
letic field in a body and assist the team 
in carrying away the honors. Accord
ingly all met at the entrance of the 
School, and led on by the Industries 
Band, directed by Cheer-Leader Ran
dal, proceeded to Tech Field. They 
kept things lively throughout the 
meet.
It might be mentioned, too, that two 
reels of the new motion pictures of 
the Schools were shown for the first 
time at this meeting of the Assembly. 
This feature caused quite a bit of 
merriment especially as the different 
students were recognized in the var
ious shops and laboratories. As a 
whole, the meeting was the best held 
during the year.
The first meeting of the New 
Castle District Alumni of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
was held in Youngstown recently. The 
men spent a very interesting time 
taking an inspection trip through the 
plant of the Republic Rubber Co. 
Dinner was served at the Hotel Ohio 
and then came a short business ses
sion, at which time L. B. Weidlein 
was elected president and J. K. Lamoree secretary and treasurer for 
this district. The unusual attendance 
was gratifying to all present and plans 
were formulated for a future meeting 
to be held in June at New Castle, Pa. 
It is especially desired that any Carne
gie graduates not present at this meet
ing and who reside in this district, com
municate with J. K. Lamoree of Carlysle street, New Castle, Pa., in order 
that they may be notified of the plans 
for the future of the organization.
The members present were Messrs.

Under the dark, cold sky of Found

defeat to the over-confident Chemi

With the score at the end of the 
first inning 4-0, Chemicals, the result 
seemed sure; but the shift of Gower 
to the box and Stevenson to the first 
bag saved the day for the Live Wires. 
Gower pitched a strong game through
out, although he loosened up a trifle 
in the ninth when the game was won.

well; while Stein starred for the

New President of Board of Mrustees 
of Carnegie snstitute Glimpses 
the Future.
All probability of a merger of Car
negie Institute of Technology and the 
University of Pittsburgh, which has 
been the subject of persistent rumor 
for some time past, was denied last 
Wednesday by Colonel Samuel Harden 
Church, newly elected president of 
the board of trustees of Carnegie In
stitute. New significance was given 
the report since the arrival of Andrew 
Carnegie in Pittsburgh, but the denial 
of Colonel Church is looked upon as 
conclusive proof that it was unfound
ed.
I know of no foundation for such 
a rumor, said Mr. Church, save the 
spirit of friendship and mutual inter
est which exists between the two in
stitutions. The technical schools have 
a broad field, and the university an
other and entirely different field. So 
far as I know, there is no possibility 
of a union of the two.
I look for a big future for the tech
nical schools. Director Hamerschlag 
is applying what I believe is a new 
method of instruction, combining the 
scientific, the intellectual and the im
aginative. When you mix imagination 
and brains with efficiency you have 
the highest educational product which 
can be turned out.
Concerning the future of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology and Carnegie 
Institute, over which Mr. Church was 
made the presiding power at the trus
tees meeting, he made no direct state
ment.
Nine years ago the technical 
schools were established with 120 
students. Today we have 3,000 stu
dents, from all the states of the Union, 
and from practically all the civilized 
nations of the world. Every Euro
pean nation is represented, and China 
and Japan also have sent students.
If this has been achieved in nine 
years what may not be achieved in the 
next 10 years?
In similar manner Mr. Church indi
cated great possibilities for the insti
tute.
We began with nothing but money, 
18 years ago. When Mr. Carnegie 
came to Pittsburgh Monday we could 
show him the institute as it now is. In 
the art department we have secured 
the best work of the modern painters. 
We havent bought the old masters. 
Were glad to see that American men 
are spending large sums to bring them 
to this country.
We are spending our money for a 
better purpose. We are buying the 
old masters of the future.
In the department of the museum 
our collections of specimens, especial
ly in the archeological and paleontolo
gical sections are consulted by al
most every scientist who writes a 
book. The library and its branches 
circulate in almost all the homes in 
Pittsburgh.
All this has been done fn 18 years. 
Much is possible, then, for the future.

No fraternity at Case will initiate a 
freshman until the second semester. 
This ruling is the result of the discus
sion held at the interfraternity con
ference a short time ago. The sugges
tion when introduced was received 
with favor, and has since been adopted 
by the unanimous vote of the fra
ternities. Nearly all concerned have 
long felt the need of co-operation in 
this matter. If satisfactory after one 
years trial the ruling will remain per
manent.
There can be no doubt as to the 
benefits derived from such a ruling, 
both to the fraternity and to the can
didate.
It is a serious blow to a fraternity 
when several newly initiated men fail 
in their college work. The standing 
of the fraternity is lowered. Of 
course material should be selected 
with the idea of scholarship in mind 
but a good showing in preparatory 
school is not always maintained at 
oollege. After initiation a man may 
not make good in his further work 
and consequently disappear at mid 
year.
Under the new ruling the pledge 
need not take an active interest in fra
ternity affairs, and attention can be 
given to establishing a firm foothold 
in his new life. Thus making success 
a condition of initiation. If a candi
date knows that he must get through 
the first term1 of his college year the 
chances are exceedingly strong that he 
will work just that much harder. In 
other words second term initiation 
will be a benefit to the college, to the 
freshman, and the fraternity.Case

Carnegie Wins Track Meet
Continued from Page 1
Our greatest strength was shown in 
the distance events, in which we 
scored 26 points out of a possible 27. 
The two-mile race was run in slow 
time, but Haselton, Rieser, and Camp
bell who finished in the order named, 
had orders to save themselves. Rieser 
proved to be a dark horse when he 
sprinted past Campbell less than a 
yard from the tape. MacMillan ran 
a splendid mile in the good time of 
4:48. Campbell was second and Handelman third. The latter made a 
game finish. After being overtaken 
by an opponent he came down the 
last stretch on his nerve and gained 
his place. In the dashes Tech took 
two firsts and a second. Hemmann 
won both the 100-yard and 220-yard 
sprints, making his best showing in 
the longer one, which he covered in
22 4-5 seconds. Getting away rather 
slowly, Dunseith finished strong, cap
turing second money in the quartermile. King displayed excellent form 
in the high hurdles and undoubtedly 
would have done better in the low 
hurdles, had that race not been held 
immediately after the high jump. 
That event Jack won easily at the 
height of 5 feet 6 3-4 inches. He then 
cleared two more inches much to the 
chagrin of the Allegheny "co-eds.
In the weight events, Capt. Clair 
outdistanced his rival leader in the 
hammer throw. After fouling twice, 
Skin simply qualified for the finals 
with a toss of about 80 teet. On his 
first of the final three tries, he won 
the contest by hurling the missile 120 
feet 5 inches. Clair attempted to 
break the Tech record, but only suc
ceeded Adams, a Plebe from the In
dustry School couldnt stay in the 
ring and to overcome his difficulty, 
removed his shoes. It was an un
usual fight to watch a hammer-thrower 
stepping around in bare feet; never
theless Adams secured a point in this 
event. Slotterer won the other two 
weight contests, Clair taking second 
in the discus and Adams third in the 
shotput. Wright defeated his old foe, 
Wells, in a rather thrilling manner. 
Hal got over the bar at 10 feet 11 3-5 
inches, but not without touching it. 
He landed on the ground and it was 
still shaking due chiefly to the effects 
of gravity and the breaths of the 
Allegheny rooters. Albeit the bar re
fused to fall and five more points were 
credited to Carnegie.
The result of the meet was very 
encouraging. Coach Dulls tendency 
to nervous prostration during the aft
ernoon turned into a serious case of 
smilitis at the end. Thanks to the 
efforts of Manager Miller and the 
treatment accorded by the Allegheny 
students, the trip proved a very pleas
ant one.

Last Saturday night at the East Lib
erty Y. M. C. A. the Musical Clubs 
gave the closing concert of its season 
before a small but highly enthusiastic 
audience.
The same program' used at the home 
concert was given, except in the place 
of Just for Fun, Johnny Schenoker, featured by many college glee 
clubs, was sung. It brought praise 
from the house for Arch Cowan who 
was usually about two counts behind 
the rest of the club.
This concert finished a season of 
twenty-one concerts and its closing 
was exemplified by the usual dash and 
vim of the fellows.
Most of the rrten are looking for
ward to the Annual Banquet and the 
granting of insignias which will take 
place in the near future.

Encouraged by a large delegation of 
rooters, the Industries School attempt
ed in vain to win the honors in the 
inter-school meet from the Science 
School, Wednesday afternoon, a week 
ago. But we deem it appropriate to 
repeat with the prophets it cant be 
done. Most of the events were inter
esting and closely contested. Two 
new school marks were hung up. Clair 
of the Science School made a record 
throw of 109 feet 3 inches with the 
discus and King, his teammate, bet
tered the outdoor high jump mark by 
half an inch, clearing the bar at 5 feet 
8*4 inches. These same two men were 
the stars of the meet, each obtaining 
three firsts. Haselton earned half the 
total number of points secured by the 
Design School in winning the twomile and half-mile runs. In the two 
lap, relay race, about one-third of a 
mile the Industries School showed its 
superiority with a well balanced quar
tet. Wright, of Science, made good 
distances in the broad jump and won 
the event from Patterson, of Science, 
who was the favorite. Blumenthal, of 
the Industries School, who displayed 
promising form in the low hurdles, is 
now a candidate for the Varsity team. 
A familiar face was seen on the track, 
when, after a years absence, Wildberg 
again entered the competition. With 
a little training he should be able to 
repeat his old time performances.

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom1 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

Carnegie scored three runs in their 
half of the sixth, after one man was 
down. DeMuth singled to right and 
went to second when Gillingham 
dropped the throw. Wherry spoiled 
his record by dropping Oeffingers fly 
and the Carnegie men were safe at 
first and second. Auerswald showed 
his heavy stick work by driving a triple 
into right field, scoring DeMuth and 
Oeffinger. Ryan hit to second and 
Auerswald was safe at home on the 
return throw. The score:

Parents and friends of the students 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology, to 
the number of 12,000, streamed steadily 
through the beautiful buildings of the 
four schools of the institute last Fri
day afternoon and evening, from the 
opening of the annual exhibition of 
student work until its close at 10:30 
oclock.
Undoubtedly, the most unique, as 
well as the most popular exhibition, 
was the 4,000-ft. moving picture of life 
at Carnegie Tech, exhibited for the 
first time. It has taken more than two 
years to perfect the picture. The pic
ture starts with Andrew Carnegie de
livering an address. It then shows 
students on various trips of inspec
tion of local industries. It shows the 
students at work and at study in every 
department of each of the four schools. 
Each school is given nearly 1,000 feet 
in the picture, which closes with stu
dent life and activities on the athletic 
field. It required 1 hour and 20 min
utes to show the picture and, each 
time it was shown, the lecture room 
in the School of Applied Industries, 
where it was exhibited, was packed.
There were demonstrations in many 
of the departments of the institute 
last Friday night because of its being 
the last night of the scholastic year 
for evening students. In each depart
ment, also, there was an exhibition of 
the work of the students, which proved 
decidedly interesting.
In the School of Applied Industries, 
the forge shop, the foundry, the brick
laying shop, the machine shop, the 
sheet metal shop, the electrical equip
ment laboratory, the printing shop, 
the pattern shop, the electric wiring 
shop, the plumbing shop, the carpen
try and manual training shop, the 
chemistry of materials laboratory and 
the mechanism laboratory were open 
for inspection with students at work 
in them all.
In the School of Applied Science 
the electric furnace, ore-dressing, as
saying, technical electro chemistry, 
metallography, sanitary engineering, 
hydraulic, materials-testing, heat, 
light, plebe, general chemistry, analy
tical chemistry, physical and theoreti
cal chemistry, statistics, dynamo and 
mechanical engineering laboratories 
were in operation. In the School of 
Applied Design, the modeling, exhi
bition, architectural drafting rooms, 
the theater, studios and logues were 
open. In the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School the pottery, weaving, 
lace-making, home design, food chem
istry, general chemistry, drawing, 
leatherwork, biology, physics, sten
ography, cooking-class, costume de
sign, sewing work and dressmaking 
rooms and the model apartment and 
gymnasium were open.Dispatch.
