White Friars Third Annual Production
VOL. IV
<TI\c (Tnrtnn
PITTSBURGH, PA , WEDNESDAY MAY 25, 1910No. 33
On Saturday afternoon the curtain of the Alvin 
Theatre will rise on the first presentation of the 
musical comedy Miss Mistaken. For five months, 
the company of 53 have been busy with rehearsals, 
dressmakers, corset fitters, and the thousand and 
one other incidentals accompanying the staging 
of the Friars offering.
Miss Mistaken is the work of coach-director 
Walter B. Edmundson, and is a live wire from the 
ring up to the final curtain. Having written one 
show and managed another, the caoch is well able 
to produce a vehicle for the histronically inclined of 
Carnegie Tech that is best suited to the needs of the 
men taking part. It is a rare thing in college dra
matics for a happier combination of circumstances 
to present themselves. Judging from the showing 
made at the rehearsals, this year will eclipse all 
previous efforts, and prove the. Clubs ability to make 
the current production better in every regard than 
that preceding. An augmented Glee chorus trained 
by W. McDorrington, musical director of the Friars 
who directs the orchestra, will have no small part in 
the affair.
To show the manner in which the company of 53 
have been doing business, we need but tell of the 
full rehearsal held in the Alvin on Tuesday night 
which began at 7.30 in the evening and lasted until 
3.30 Wednesday morning with but a single pause of 
fifteen minutes. The dress rehearsal will be held in 
the Alvin on Thursday night beginning at 11 p. m.

On Tuesday, May 17th, Miss Bradt took her class 
in Institutional Mangement on an inspection tour 
to the Young Womens Christian Association on 
Chatham Street.
The entrance hall is spacious and attractive. The 
second, third and fourth floors are used for the gym
nasium, swimming pool, library and bed rooms. 
Room and board can be obtained at from $4.50 to 
$6.50 per week. At no other place so near the city 
could such attractive rooms be found unless in a 
hotel. There is one suite available for $3.00 per day.
The Domestic Science and Art Department are lo
cated on the 5th floor. The former consists of a 
class kitchen, store room, lecture room, kitchen for 
two and a very pretty dining room for serving les
sons. Miss Skinner who has been in charge of this 
department for the last four or five years has just 
left, and Miss Faucett, a graduate of Drexel Institute 
has taken her place.
The place in which the girls were most interested 
was the cafeteria. It is located on the sixth flooran admirable place as no odors from the cooking are 
noticeable throughout the building. The room is ar 
ranged for table and counter service. The counter is 
covered with opaque glass and is equipped with 
shelves for dishes, a tea and coffee urn, ice chest for 
milk and butter, a steam table and an oven to keep 
the rolls hot. They have the system of paying as one 
leaves which is very good and is to be recommended. 
This system enables the cashier to balance her cash 
daily by aluminum checks which she takes in. These 
checks are more sanitary than the paper checks 
used in other places.
Behind the dining room is a splendid pantry with 
china cupboards and dish washers. Back of this is 
the kitchen equipped with cooking tables with the 
sinks built in, stationary soup kettle, steamers, broil
ers, etc. The bakery is not used at present, but it 
is the intention of the manager to open it next fall 
and serve home-made bread and rolls.
A roof cafe has been built and in some future time 
it will be opened. Plant boxes are built along the 
front. There are big firs at the ends. It will be a 
very attractive place when it is furnished.
After the girls left the Y. W. C. A., on Miss Bradts 
invitation they visited Reymers where they in
spected the Sundaes.
Miss Frances Kempel, a Senior in the Household 
Arts Department of the M. M. C., has accepted the 
position of assistant to Miss Bailey, manager of the 
Joseph Horne restaurant.
Miss Kempel will be given an opportunity to put 
in practice what she has learned in her course in 
Institutional Management, she will be largely re
sponsible for the menues and gain valuable exper
ience in buying foods in quantity and in catering to 
numbers.
We sincerely hope she will not be overcome by the 
responsibility which is hers, that of proving to Pitts
burgh and the world that the Household Art Depart
ment stands for and what our graduates may be ex
pected to accomplish in the future.
Women are filling responsible positions as purvey
ors in colleges, managers of tea rooms and cafes.
The restaurants in the Wanamaker Stores in New 
York and Philadelphia are managed by a woman who 
receives a salary of $15,000 and the salary paid to the 
woman manager of the Marshall Field Restaurant in 
Chicago, for the past four years is $10,000.
COMET EXCITEMENT.
The appearance of Haileys Comet in the Western 
sky has been an interesting event inasmuch as the 
new observatory with the Brashear II telescope has 
been put to use for the first time. Sunday night 
and Monday were the only clear nights, but there 
are several more open to the public. The adjust
ments of t-he instrument have not progressed far 
enough to permit of its photographic attachment be
ing used with any degree of satisfaction. Mr. Dorweiler of the A. <& J. faculty has had the instrument 
in charge during the times when it has been open to 
the public.
LECTURE BY HON. OLIVER STEWART OF ILL.
The Hon. Oliver Stewart, state senator from Illi
nois, delivered an interesting and forcible lecture on 
the Liquor Traffic in the A. & J. Assembly Hall on 
Thursday afternoon. The speaker has been deliver
ing this lecture before the student bodies of a num
ber of the larger educational institutions in our vicin
ity, and came here at the solicitation of Mr. Calderwood of the A. & J. faculty and Mr. Gamble, the act
ing field secretary of the Prohibition Party.
The address dealt with the question from the econ
omic standpoint only, and in this particular was ex
ceedingly consistent and well handled. The speak 
er has a pleasing and strong personality and never 
let his hearers out of his grasp. Uulike so many 
laboring in this cause, sentimental gush and heartthrobs were lacking entirely and the argument 
gained much strength thereby. Carnegie Tech is 
fortunate in having met and heard so straightfor
ward a man.

EDITORIAL
NOTICE.
The lateness of this edition has been caused by 
a delay in securing the list of patronesses of the 
White Friar production.
THE TRACK MEET.
The University of Pittsburg is to congratulated 
on the maner in which they managed their annual 
track meet. Such an affair as this reflects great 
credit on the institution having it in charge. We 
only hope to be able to duplicate the courtesy of 
being able to invite Pitt to a Tech Meet some one 
of these fine days.
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION
The international exhibition should be viewed by 
all students. You may not be an artist, but you 
know what pleases you along these lines. A trip 
through the gallery will do you much good; then, too, 
when you go back to Youngstown or Mechanicsburg 
for your vacation and tell of the extra things you 
have seen and done; it will help wonderfully. Gen 
eral culture, dont you know.
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITIES.
In view of the little interest in student activities 
evinced by some Carnegie men, the following, taken 
from the Yale News, may not come in amiss:
Across the warp of so many interests is shot the 
woof of so many purposes and side issues in our 
skurrying college life that it is continually a question 
how to get the most out of the glare and rush of the 
hours, how only to miss as few as possible of the in
numerable possibilities and opportunities slipping 
through our lingers. Hence the prevalent habit of 
announcing ourselves to be too busy to undertake 
anything new, while knowing ourselves to be daily 
guilty of time elaborately thrown away. But the 
men who achieve, do so by finding time and to spare 
for everything, while their ineffectual neighbors are 
largely preoccupied with bemoaning the shortness of 
the fleeting day.
College life is a life surfeited with opportunity, 
and the one lesson to be learned at the outset is the 
fine art of finding time. For the happy-starred, on 
whom appear to be accidentally showered those 
prizes for which other men lie vainly ploting, are 
usually no more nor less than past-masters in the 
science of daily deposing of their twenty-four al
lotted hours.- For the art of living swimmingly and 
buoyantly lies in the discreet mingling of occupa
tions.
MEMORIAL DAY SPEAKERS.
The arrangements for the observance of Memorial 
Day are much similar to those in force last year. 
The exercises to take place in the Schools will be 
held on Thursday, May 26, at 11 a. m. The place will 
be posted on the Bulletin boards. The following men 
will deliver addresses: Mr. James M. Schoonmaker, 
Mr. Alexander Dempster, Mr. C. C. Arensberg, Mr. 
C. C. Scaife and Mr. Chambers McKibbin. It is de
sired to have the services well attended by the stu
dent body.
TENNIS.
The tournament now being played to decide the 
members of the Team to represent Tech in the tourn
ament. to be given later by the University of Pitts
burg, is exciting much interest and shows good 
spirit. The courts occupied by the contests are al
ways crowded about with spectators anxiously await
ing the results of the finish. Up to the time of going 
to press the matches in the semi-finals were DuffWoods, Mascn-Flood, Ericson-Sterling, and the re
sults, Wood, Flood and Ericson.
The Freshmen Class at Harvard will publish a 
yearbook very soon. This is the first time at Har
vard that any other than the Senior class has at
tempted such a feat.

Western Reserve Wins in the Tenth
After winning every contest this season with the 
Western Reserve aggregation, Tech prevented a 
complete shut out for the year by letting last Sat
urdays base ball game slip away in the tenth inn
ing. Beisgen pitched good ball, and his contest with 
Rafferty of Reserve was an interesting one. Beis
gen allowed but five hits, passed only two men and 
only once threw wild, but the browsers on the rear 
range made up for this with costly errors. Gearhart 
thrice tripped the light fantastic back of what looked 
like hits and made good throws to first.
Tech scored the two runs in the eighth as a result 
of a triple, a single and a base on balls. Score:

Intercollegiate Meet
The annual track meet given by the University of 
Pittsburgh took place on Saturday at the Schenley 
Oval, and was won by our neighbors on the hill. 
The inter-scholastic meet run in conjunction with the 
major meet proved an interesting one in which some 
splendid time was made. Second place in the inter
collegiate was hotly contested and decided by the last 
event of the meet. Five records were broken: one 
mile run, two mile run, shot put, discus throw, and 
relay race. In the scholastic, three fell, the one mile, 
pole vault, and relay.
The meet was admirable handled and managed 
and a most successful affair.

Many instructors have attempted the duty of sug
gestive inspiration by giving impromptu sermons 
whenever the spirit happened to move them suf
ficiently in the class room. This method is good 
enough for a starter but it is finished, over and for
gotten before it has really gotten under way.
It does but very little good for a speaker to get 
up and exhort to greater efforts a crowd of 25 or 50 
whom he is but very slightly acquainted with. The 
result can only be accomplished by small groups of 
students gathered around one member of the faculty 
or instructing staff. This can be done at smokers 
and club rooms, but best of all at gatherings in the 
homes of the instructors.
Nowadays a fellow who goes to a professors 
house does so with great dread, first because he doas 
not feel in his proper place, and second, because h 
has some sort of a hazy notion that he is doing some
thing that will not be well taken by those of his 
fellow students who may think he is gaining some 
unwarranted advantage.

STUDENTS AND FACULTY.CAMPBELL COYLE, Minister
Editorial from Boston Tech.
Are the relations between faculty and students 
just right? Have the two bodies interests in com
mon when it comes down to the last analysis? Do 
they appreciate each others standpoint?
To a greater and greater extent the two have been 
drifting along until now it is almost unreserverly 
true that the two only come together at classes. 
While it is true that this is the most important place 
for such relations and while it is also true that we 
come here largely with the intention of getting the 
ability to comprehend the various forms of engineer
ing or science, we also come for another purpose 
to be molded into real men.
The class room cannot alone accomplish this aim.

A regular plan must be adopted to meet this situa
tion. The ice should be broken by having a smoker, 
with possibly no speakers, as a regular Friday even
ing entertainment for students and instructors. The 
Institute committee has taken up the suggestion on 
the matter and has already appointed a committee to 
look into the matter and see whether it is feasible 
or not. The idea of this affair should be to make it 
as informal as possible and see that the instructors 
get together with a bunch of students whom they 
may be more or less acquainted with, and then to let 
both find that there is something they have in com
mon outside of the mere class room interests.
Still, this step should never be taken with an idea 
that it is an end in itself; it is merely a means of 
letting the faculty know that there is a real hanker
ing on the part of the students to learn their per
sonality. That is where the great difference comes 
between correspondence schools and Tech.
The next step is plainly up to the faculty. They 
must take it upon themselves to show the students 
that they are really wanted by not giving nice, in
definite invitations, but specific ones. These small 
groups should get together not once in the school 
year, but frequently. The first time just clears the 
ground; those following bring out both sides.
This small group idea is far from being a new 
one, but it is also far from being an idea that has 
been given the proper development. Those who have 
and are attempting to bridge the gap by this method 
may rest assured that their efforts are far from 
futile, but it must be a general custom to be really 
effective in developing men able to advance human 
interests after they leave the Institute.
