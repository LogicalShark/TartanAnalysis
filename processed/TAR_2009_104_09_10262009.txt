Recently, Carnegie Mel
lon was ranked 19th in the 
presentation titled Saviors of 
Our Cities: A Survey of Best 
College and University Civic 
Partnerships, conducted by 
Evan S. Dobelle, president of 
Westfield State College. Ac
cording to the official website, 
the 25 colleges and universi
ties were selected because of 
their positive impact on their 
urban communities, includ
ing both commercial and resi
dential activities such as revi
talization, cultural renewal, 
economics, and community 
service and development. 
Pennsylvania is home to 
four of the universities on the 
list of 25, more than any other 
state included
ings. University of Pennsylva
nia, University of Pittsburgh, 
and Drexel University tied 
for first, tied for second, and 
placed 10th, respectively.
The survey noted the Sum
mer Academy for Mathemat
ics and Sciences (SAMS), and 
Dobelle praised this program 
for its engagement of prospec
tive college students. Lindsey 
Pherribo, currently a first-year 
biology major, was a part of 
SAMS the summer before her 
senior year in high school. 
Pherribo enjoyed the variety 
of classes, saying that the 
course options vary depending 
on which grade youre in, but I 
took a biology class, calculus, 
SAT prep, and music engineer
ing. I also had an English class 
where we worked on things 
to prepare us for applying to 
college such as college admisof the reasons she decided to 
attend Carnegie Mellon upon 
her acceptance.
SAMS was really helpful to 
me in helping me choose a col
lege and getting through the 
college admissions process, 
said Pherribo, adding that the 
program is very organized 
and well run.
Also mentioned in the sur
vey was the Leonard Gelfand 
Center for Outreach and Ser
vice Learning, which deals 
with over 85 programs serv
ing local students and teach
ers from kindergarten to 12th 
grade. Offered are opportuni
ties in professional develop
ment and certification, as well 
as childrens tutoring, mentor
ing and enrichment, accord

cal non-profit organizations, 
according to the website.
For an article on the Car
negie Mellon website, Judith 
Hallinen, assistant vice pro
vost for educational outreach 
and director of the Gelfand 
Center, said that the programs 
can encourage students from 
all disciplines to be more re
flective on their responsibility 
to society with the talents that 
they have.
We want our students 
to consider what can you do 
that will change someones 
life, what is the thing that you 
can do that will make a differ

On Oct. 19th, Paula Guti
errez Galindo, a community 
organizer with the Binational 
Front of Indigenous Organiza
tions (FIOB), presented Sto
ries of Mexicos Displaced 
in the McKenna room in the 
University Center. Her pur
pose was to try to help listen
ers understand the reasons 
why migrants leave their 
homes, to see the stories be
hind their journeys, and to 
learn how they can help. Her 
tour was sponsored by a group 
called Witness for Peace MidAtlantic, a group dedicated 
to peace-based initiatives. At 
the university, the lecture was 
sponsored by the new global 
studies major and the Depart
ment of Modern Languages.
Galindo grew up in Oax
aca, Mexico, in a family of 
five children. Over 90 percent 
of her family has migrated to 
the United States. When she 
was a child, she would wait 
with anticipation along with 
her siblings for the stories 
and goods that would return 
with family members from 
the United States. The pat
tern for many workers was to 
spend six months in the Unit
ed States and return home for 
six months. Her older sister 
and brother migrated, but her 
brother was forced to return 
to Mexico to raise his daugh
ter when his wife left. Back in 
Oaxaca, they are struggling to 
survive.
This story is nothing 
compared to many stories of 
people who have to migrate 
to survive, said Galindo. The 
only option for countless mi
grants is to perish from pov
erty or risk migrating to the 
United States. Over 50 percent 
of the immigrants are between 
15 and 24 years of age, and 
Galindo is among the youth 
swimming against the stream 
and trying to stay in Mexico. 
Working in her community of 
Oaxaca, she is able to see first
hand the results of migration, 
such as loss of indigenous cul
ture, drug use, and the spread 
of diseases such as AIDS. In 
one year, the climax, Oaxaca 
had 250,000 migrants, partly 
due to the fact that it is one of 
the three poorest municipali
ties in the country.
Among other reasons, Gal
indo explained that people mi
grate for employment issues, 
poverty, search for better liv
ing conditions, tradition, and 
family reunification.
It is not for fun or for plea
sure. .. it is out of necessity that
we migrate, Galindo said. 
The economic crisis in Mexico 
is a primary factor, which was 
worsened, as shown in Gal
indos presentation, by the 
North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), origi
nating in 1994.
Traditional farmers in 
Mexico grow organic pro
duce, which is expensive and 
takes longer to grow. NAFTA 
made it possible for cheaper, 
American subsidized food 
companies to export products 
to Mexico. A prime example is 
the corn industry, one of Mex
icos staple food crops. Farm
ers using organic methods 
can take 17.8 days to produce 
one ton of corn, but American 
grain companies can make one 
ton in less than 1.2 hours. This 
cheaper, though genetically

ALLIES attends civil rights march in D.C.
On Oct. 11, students of 
Carnegie Mellon organized a 
bus to join the National Equal

The march was performed to 
raise national awareness of les
bian, gay, bisexual, and trans
gender (LGBT) civil rights and 
to demand full and equal pro

cally, the goal was to take ac

of national anti-gay legislation, 
including Dont Ask, Dont 
Tell (DADT), which limits the 
rights of homosexuals to serve 
their country in the military, 
and the Defense of Marriage 
Act (DOMA), which reserves 
marital rights to heterosexual 
couples.

Study shows benefits of daily texting
DOMINIQUE DAVIS
Staffwriter
A study in New Zealand 
demonstrated that providing 
motivational support through 
daily text messages to young 
cigarette smokers might help 
them quit smoking. The New 
Zealand Ministry of Health 
provided funding for a chari
table trust organization called 
The Quit Group, which en
ables the development of in
novative cessation programs 
to help New Zealanders quit 
smoking. The programs vary 
using television, radio, print 
campaigns, and a national 
telephone quit-line.
The Quit Group deployed 
STOMP (STop smoking
Over Mobile Phone), a pro
gram targeted toward 16- to
24-year-olds to help them quit 
through text messages rang
ing from advice and support 
to facts about the health ben
efits of quitting. A clinical trial 
involved 1700 participants 
of whom half were sent sup
porting text messages and the 
other half were sent generic 
health messages. Of the group 
who received motivational 
texts, 28 percent self-reported 
that they had quit smoking 
after 26 weeks. Of the group 
that received generic texts, 
only 13 percent said they had 
quit.
Tina Robinson, a senior 
directing major, said of the 
text messages, I dont think
Photo Illustration by Michelle Liu/Photo Staff
it would help, because when 
I smoke, I dont care about 
the health risks. According 
to studies, the majority of 
participants who quit did not 
succeed long-term. I know 
smoking [is] extremely un
healthy for me. Ive seen the 
effects of smoking. Personally, 
I dont like being reminded of 
that and I think I would be an
gry at the text messages. On a 
good day, I would appreciate 
them, but on a bad day, they 
would just make me upset, 
said Robinson.
A review of the study 
showed that 33 percent of par
ticipants who reported they 
had quit at the end of the study 
had not smoked four weeks 
after their quit date. When re
viewed again after 22 weeks, 
only 16 percent said they still 
had not had a cigarette.
Kelley Shell, a health pro
motion specialist at Student 
Health Services, said that on 
average, people attempt to 
quit smoking seven times be
fore they are successful. Peo
ple often minimize the power 
of the physical addiction, 
said Shell. Nicotine is incred
ibly addictive. People become 
addicted physically, mentally, 
and their behaviors become 
tied to using tobacco, so the 
addiction is pretty complex.
Shell believes that cessa
tion programs that provide 
support through text messaging can work. It seems to be a 
helpful approach because its 
one way to get regular, encour
aging messages to individuals 
who are dealing with nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms and 
feelings of wanting to give up. 
Sofia Shrank, a sophomore di
recting major, wants to stop 
smoking, but cigarettes have 
become a part of her routine, 
so she has found it difficult to 
quit. I think supportive text 
messages would help a lot and 
I would absolutely be interest
ed in a program like that.
Student Health Services 
offers many options to help 
people quit. Smokers can 
meet with a health promotion 
specialist who will work with 
them to determine the best 
plan of action and meet with 
them regularly to support 
them through the quitting 
process, free of charge.
Students, faculty, and staff 
can purchase nicotine patches 
and gum at a discounted price. 
They also offer an 8-week 
group program for staff mem
bers who are quitting. They 
have not yet created a group 
for students, but if there is 
interest, the group may be ex
panded.
Any member of the campus 
community interested in quit
ting smoking can call Student 
Health Services at (412) 268- 
2157 to schedule a smoking 
cessation appointment.
Carnegie Mellon 
goes to the March
Galindos story meant to help others
MIGRANTS, from A1
modified, corn caused damage 
to Mexicos industry. Needless 
to say, the small farmers of 
Mexico found it almost impos
sible to compete. A change in 
Mexicos constitution around 
the same time allowed com
munity lands to be privatized, 
and poor farmers sold their 
land to earn thealmost 10,000 
to 15,000 pesos that it can cost 
to cross the border.
Within the country, foreign 
companies built factories that, 
though creating job opportu
nities, paid the equivalent of 
$10 for eight hours of hard 
labor. The mission of Galindo 
and the two members of Wit
ness for Peace present at the 
lecture was to inform the au
dience about this situation 
and reveal that there are solu
tions.
One member of Witness for 
Peace, Ben Beachy, mentioned
that there is a bill in Congress 
that would be the first to re
negotiate NAFTA, called the 
trade pact. Galindos sugges
tions were direct, as she urged 
citizens of both countries to 
become socially and political
ly involved and work for equal 
support for the countryside.
Emily Feenstra, a firstyear science and humanities 
student in a seminar on hu
man rights and global politics 
taught by Silvia Borzutsky, attended the lecture. '
I think that Paulas situ
ation, the percentage of her 
family that has migrated, and 
how people [migrant work
ers] often return for certain 
months of the year, was re
ally striking, she said, add
ing that she spoke to her class 
about the lecture. I think it 
does speak to awareness of 
different diversities and being 
open-minded, especially in 
political situations.
ALLIES, from A1
tion of the weekends events. 
On Saturday, there was an 
equality march and other 
activities for students, which 
were followed by the main 
march on Sunday at noon 
and the rally at about 2 p.m.
The bus from Carnegie 
Mellon was filled with stu
dents from several of Pitts
burghs campuses, members 
of several of Pittsburghs LGBT 
organizations, and other ad
vocates from around the city, 
making a total of about 50 
people. Students from Carn
egie Mellon held up a banner 
for the entire march that read 
Carnegie Mellon ALLIES. 
Graduating queers for over 
100 years. The group took a 
day trip, leaving early in the 
morning and returning later 
that evening.
Carnegie Mellon ALLIES, 
along with student organiza
tions from almost 40 other 
universities nationwide, 
helped sponsor and attended 
the march.
There were over 250,000 
other people in Washington,
D.C. during the weekend, 
most of whom were students 
from all over the world who 
joined forces to march the 
streets of Washington from 
McPherson Square to the 
Capitol Building. Some of 
the chants that were heard 
included:' Hey, Obama, let 
mama marry mama, Gay, 
straight, black, white. All we 
want is equal rights, and 
What do we want? Equal 
rights. When do we want 
them? Now. The end of the 
march was followed by a mas
sive rally in front of the Capi
tol with 30 different speak
ers from around the world. 
Among them were Cleve 
Jones, Lt. Dan Choi, Judy 
Shepard, and Lady Gaga.
Merri Ebel, the president 
of ALLIES, the Carnegie Mel
lon organization that planned 
the trip, mentioned that the 
newspapers predicted there 
to be about 50,000 people 
at the march and rally. She 
was very happy to see people 
from all sorts of groups come 
together that were from dif
ferent states and from differ
ent cities and from different 
backgrounds to rally for the 
same cause. Among many 
other college groups which 
attended the national event, 
it was also very uplifting to 
see religious groups, a moth
ers group, and a few labor 
unions, Ebel said.
There have been several 
marches in the past; howev
er, a National Equality March 
in Washington, D.C. of this 
magnitude has not happened 
since the term of President 
Clinton, who implemented 
DADT while he was in office. 
During his term as Indiana 
Senator, Obama was sup
portive of gay rights and even 
scored high on a test issued by 
the Human Rights Campaign 
that measured sponsorship 
of key issues and rights per
taining to gay and lesbian 
citizens. More recently, the 
Matthew Shepard Act, which 
vows to protect the victims 
of hate crimes, was passed 
through Congress this past 
Thursday. Obama promises 
to sign the act into law by the 
end of this month.

Zakaria speaks on U.S.
relations with Middle East
ZAKARIA, from A1
indeed dangerous, but the 
government is effectively re
sponding, Zakaria said.
Similarly, he suggested 
that despite the Wall Street 
collapse, the government, the 
businesses, and the people re
sponded to the crisis, which in 
turn is helping the economy 
swing back into shape.
Tapping into Middle East
ern affairs  his specialty
 Zakaria proposed a ro
bust capitalist solution to the 
woes of the region. He also 
discussed the decreasing im
pact of Islamic fundamental
ism on the Muslim popula
tion, and how a shift toward a 
more capitalist culture in the 
broader Middle East can fur
ther help uproot the desire to 
follow an extremist agenda.
The Middle East spans 
southwestern Asia, southeast
ern Europe, and northeastern 
Africa, with many oil-rich 
monarchies  such as the 
United Arab Emirates and Qa
tar  located in and around 
the Persian Gulf.
The wealthy monarchies, 
Zakaria suggests, represent 
the future of the Middle East 
as they continue to modernize 
in a slow organic manner in
stead of booming into brutal 
dictatorships.
The United States fears Is
lamic fundamentalism with
out noticing that its lure in the 
Middle East is gradually di
minishing, Zakaria said. The 
Middle East is awakening to
the dangers of jihad as Mus
lims begin to see the futility of 
violence as a political tool.
Violence is a lost politi
cal argument  Osama bin 
Laden can instigate terrorism 
but not get 5000 people out 
on the streets to demand his 
ideal Islamic society, he said.
Along with a greater sense 
of awareness, the embrace of 
modernization is at the heart 
of societal progress in the 
Middle East, Zakaria said.
He cited Dubai, United 
Arab Emirates, the booming 
metropolitan center of the 
Arabian Gulf, as symbolic of 
the new Middle East. Along 
with Dubais strong command 
of commerce, its robust gov
ernment, global managerial 
standards, and lack of corrup
tion demonstrate the ability of 
countries in the Arab world to 
climb the socioeconomic lad
der even as they hold tightly 
onto their religious and cul
tural backgrounds. Dubai is 
an example of how the Arab 
world can have diversity and 
manage it well, said Zakaria.
The power of capitalism, 
trade, and modernity do not 
negate the forces of religion, 
but of religious extremity, said 
Zakaria, and the acknowledg
ment and understanding of 
this idea is the real solution to 
the Middle East crisis.
During an interactive Q&A 
session, Zakaria also dis
cussed the increasingly com
petitive relationship between 
the United States and China, 
U.S.-Iranian relations, and the

Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
On the Israeli-Palestinian 
clash, Zakaria said that peace
ful coexistence can only be 
achieved when both sides real
ize that they have much more 
to gain through cooperating 
with each other on a political 
and economic level. Israel 
needs to realize that moving 
forward with Gaza limits its 
potential, and the Palestinians 
need to understand the enor
mous value to them of coexist
ing with the Israelis, he said.
However, Zakarias reso
lution of the conflict came 
across as unrealistic to YongGyun Choi, a sophomore in 
the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences. The problem 
here is Mr. Zakarias implica
tion that people have not yet 
realized the value of a liberal 
market, said Choi. The as
sumption that if both groups 
were to realize the benefits 
of a capitalistic market in the 
Middle East, then they would 
both stop the war that has 
been ensuing since the cre
ation of Israel, seemed over
simplified and idealistic.
It was interesting to wit
ness a major political analyst 
debate such hot topics,  said 
Eduardo Benatuil, a senior 
economics major. Lectures 
like Zakarias are very impor
tant because they offer not 
only Carnegie Mellon, but the 
entire Pittsburgh community, 
a different outlook on affairs 
that shape the political future 
of the United States and the 
world at large, he said.
In 1999, Zakaria was 
named one of the 21 most 
important people of the 21st 
Century by Esquire magazine, 
and in 2007, his name was in
cluded among the 100 lead
ing public intellectuals in the 
world by Foreign Policy. With 
a keen eye toward Middle 
Eastern affairs, Zakaria has 
also penned several books, in
cluding The Future of Freedom 
and his recent best seller, The 
Post American World.

Professor utilizes 
math to save lives
PLATZER, from A5
is how to figure out if 
the interaction of phys
ics with control always 
works correctly, which can be 
surprisingly subtle, Platzer 
said.
He also noted some of the 
shortcomings of previous test
ing methods: Unfortunately, 
these analysis approaches 
were mostly limited to linear 
dynamics, but the real world 
is highly nonlinear. Likewise, 
the number of variables were 
restricted to around four. It 
is because of this that Platzer 
is working to broaden anti
collision analysis to become 
more dimensional and non
linear, and more like the real 
world. Platzer sees plenty 
of room for progress in his 
work. His ideas will not be
restricted to collision avoid
ance in aircraft and trains, 
but to anyone hoping to build 
and design a complex system. 
Computers control much of 
our world nowadays, and it 
is imperative that they do not 
malfunction when problems 
arise.
So far, the particular 
application scenarios that I 
looked at already were most
ly from the transportation 
domain, including air traffic 
and railway control. Because 
of the ubiquitous nature of 
cyber-physical systems, ap
plications are truly all over 
the place, say in power grids, 
robotics, medical devices, 
power plants, and pacemak
ers. There might be no better 
word than brilliant for re
search that impacts so many 
fields of study.
HEALTH TALK
Alzheimers disease: 
Gradual death of neurons
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
SciTech Editor
In 1906, Dr. Alois Alzheim
er noticed a strange condition 
in one of his patients. She 
suffered from memory loss, 
language problems, and also 
showed behavioral changes. 
These symptoms are seen far 
more frequently now, and the 
condition has been given a 
name  Alzheimers disease.
Those suffering from Al
zheimers disease (AD) face 
memory problems and are 
unable to perform the most 
menial tasks necessary for 
living a normal life.
What makes this disease 
all the more worrisome is 
that it is common among 
the elderly; statistics from 
the Mayo Clinic show that 
nearly 50 percent of people 
pver 01e age pf 85 years 1ave 
AD. A rare form pf the dis
ease, called early onset Al
zheimers disease, occurs in 
patients under the age of 65 
years. Only 5 to 10 percent of 
people develop this form of 
the disease.
Early onset Alzheimers is 
even less common for those 
between 30 and 40 years of 
age, but cases of Alzheimers 
in patients between these 
ages have also been recorded. 
Research has shown that this 
form of the disease could be 
hereditary.
As of now, according to 
the National Institute of Ag
ing, nearly 2.4 to 2.5 million 
Americans are suffering from 
AD.
These statistics, coupled 
with the fact that currently 
there is no satisfactory cure 
for AD, have caused scientists 
across the world to study the 
disease and to try to delve 
into its root causes.
AD is caused by a gradual 
degradation of brain cells 
leading to memory loss at 
first, and then a steady de
cline in all mental capacities. 
Dr. Alzheimer studied the 
brain of his patient after she 
died and discovered various 
clumps and masses of tan
gled fibers within the brain. 
The clumps have now been 
discovered to be amyloid 
plaques, while the fibers are 
now called neurofibrillary 
tangles.
Amyloid plaques are com
posed of a protein called 
beta-amyloid. Normally, a 
protein called the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP) is 
cut by an enzyme called al
pha secretase. This cutting 
produces fragments that can 
be easily degraded.
However, for reasons that 
are still not completely un
derstood, alpha secretase 
activity reduces in patients 
with AD.
The task of degrading 
APP is then taken up by the 
enzymes beta secretase and 
gamma secretase.
These enzymes cut APP 
in such a way that the frag
ments produced are hard to 
degrade.
These fragments clump to
gether, forming the plaques.
Scientists have discovered 
that excessive beta-amyloid 
may interfere with the signal
ing between different neu
rons, ultimately causing the 
neurons to die.
Plaques may also release 
free radicals, which are chem
ical species with unpaired 
electrons, that can harm the 
nearby cells.
Neurofibrillary tangles 
are the second feature of the 
disease.
These are composed of 
a protein called tau. Tau is 
normally needed for main
taining the normal internal 
structure of neurons.
Abnormal formation of 
tau leads to the production of 
twisted tau fibers that form 
the tangles. Since tau is criti
cal for the neurons, this mal
function of tau can cause cell 
dea01.
Although there have been 
significant advances in dis
covering the cause of AD, 
there still is no cure for the 
disease. Current treatments 
focus on reducing the symp
toms of the disease and help
ing the patients retain the 
mental functions needed for 
daily living as long as pos
sible.
The most commonly 
prescribed medicines are 
cholinesterase inhibitors. 
Cholinesterase is an enzyme 
that degrades acetylcholine, 
a neurotransmitter. By in
hibiting cholinesterase, the 
medicines seek to increase 
acetylcholine levels. This 
would enable better commu
nication between neurons.
This treatment involv
ing cholinesterase inhibitors 
can help delay the onset of 
severe AD, but it is unable 
to completely cure patients. 
Researchers are therefore 
searching for factors that 
increase the risk of contract
ing the disease.
Studies involving early 
onset AD revealed that two 
genes could be possible for 
the disease.
Last year, researchers from 
the Weill Medical College of 
Cornell University found a 
gene that could be linked to 
the more common late on
set form of the disease. This 
gene has been named CALHM1 and could significantly 
increase the risk of contract
ing the disease.
Another study, published 
last week in the journal 
Molecular Neurodegeneration, 
shows that a high protein diet 
could significantly increase 
the risk of contracting AD. 
The study was conducted by 
studying the brains of mice 
after feeding them different 
types of diets for a period of 
14 weeks.
After 18 weeks, the brains 
of the mice were studied and 
it was found that the mice 
on the high protein diet had 
brains that were 5 percent 
lighter than those on other 
diets.
The researchers thus con
cluded that these mice were 
more susceptible to Alzheim
ers disease.

CMU creates super efficient, energy saving computer clusters
DYLAN MORI
Junior Staffwriter
Hannah Gordon/Art Staff
Anyone walking around 
Carnegie Mellons campus can 
attest to the sheer amount of 
computer workspace avail
able, which, while very help
ful to a student in need of 
a printout .in five minutes, 
causes the schools energy in
put to be staggeringly high. 
However, Carnegie Mellons 
computer science department, 
in conjunction with Intel Labs 
Pittsburgh, has developed a 
new system called Fast Array 
of Wimpy Nodes, or FAWN, 
in order to increase energy 
efficiency in computer clus
ters. In this system, each node 
acts as a small, individual 
computer, each with its own 
network interface, and since 
the nodes consume much less 
power, they are called wimpy 
nodes.
The plan was developed 
by a research team headed 
by David Andersen, assistant 
professor of computer science, 
and Michael Kaminsky, a se
nior research scientist at Intel. 
The team began this research 
over a year ago, and as time 
went on, they began to build 
an infrastructure of the nodes, 
eventually arriving at a point 
at which the nodes were ca
pable of processing 10 to 100 
times more queries as tradi
tional disk-based clusters at 
the same energy cost. A query 
involves a key-value storage 
system in which a user looks 
up the key and gets values in 
return. Kaminsky, who is in
volved in distributed systems 
and networking operating sys
tems, compares a query to the 
search features on Facebook 
and Twitter.
Research involved in the 
computer cluster field indi
cates how far the technology 
has come in the last 20 years.
At one time, computer clusters 
were reserved for only those 
people with supercomputers. 
Since the technology has ad
vanced to a more local level 
and more and more people 
are forming clusters, the en
ergy usage has become a much 
larger issue for everyone.
In two years, data centers 
as a whole are going to com
prise three percent of all ener
gy usage in the United States, 
said Vijay Vasudevan, a com
puter science Ph.D. candidate 
on the research team. FAWN
is a very timely work, in the 
sense of its tackling a problem 
thats become a very big issue 
in the past few years.
Each node uses about three 
watts of energy, a huge reduc
tion from the 100 watts of 
energy many computers use. 
The nodes are aligned in a 21- 
node series, matching them 
to a storage device known as 
a flash card, which has about 
four gigabytes of memory. In 
addition to the nodes and flash 
card, each FAWN node con
tains a low-power processor.
Flash memory is the same 
technology as that in a digi
tal camera memory card. It 
is both faster than traditional 
magnetic disks and requires 
lower power. The flash mem
ory is coupled with Intels 
Atom processor, noted for its 
low-power adaptations. FAWN 
is suitable for managing a ran
dom access workload, similar 
to the technology found on 
Facebook and Twitter. Amar 
Phanishayee, another Ph.D. 
student on the team, makes a 
comparison: When you log on
to Facebook, the information 
stored on every person in the 
world on the website must be 
narrowed down to only your 
friends.
In such a case, it is far eas
ier to access the small data 
set that includes your friends 
rather than accessing the larg
er data set that includes every
one on Facebook.
FAWN works in a similar 
manner, narrowing down to a 
few data points from a much 
larger set.
The process has not been
without its problems, how
ever. Kaminsky says that the 
right network architecture (or 
arrangement of the nodes) 
must still be found and the 
response level of the cluster 
should remain high'. The is
sue with the latter problem is 
consistency within the cluster, 
which involves keeping the 
nodes in synchronization with 
one another.
With unsuitable consis
tency, the computer will not 
perform as quickly as it would 
otherwise. Another problem 
faced by the research team has 
been the relatively slow speed 
of the process cards.
They are not the quickest 
cards available, but the team 
has been able to counteract the 
slowness by balancing them 
with input/output bandwidth.
Looking to the future, Va
sudevan and Phanishayee pre
dict that new green industries 
will be particularly interested 
in the FAWN technology.
Companies that may show 
interest in the future include 
Microsoft, Google, and any 
other corporation that has a 
large data center. Googles 
data center, for example, con
tains the search engine, the email service Gmail, and many 
other applications. A lowenergy plan would make the 
services seem more desirable 
over Googles competitors.
Kaminsky, however, re
minds us that FAWN has not 
been released commercially 
and that it is still in the re
search phase, and he also says 
that they are not in contact 
with any groups trying to 
roll it out. So until the day 
comes when the technology is 
available to the general cam
pus, spending day and night 
on homework, Facebook, or 
Skype will not reduce your 
carbon footprint. But, Kamin
sky notes, The door is open.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARDRIPA in Britain restricts peoples rights to privacy
Frances Soong/Art Staff
Biden voices opinion against Obama
It takes a strong personality to 
hold the dissenting view in the room 
 especially when that room con
tains Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, 
and a number of other top White 
House officials. However, reports 
seem to indicate that Joe Biden is 
happy to do just this.
Bidens views on the war, most 
recently on increasing troop num
bers in Afghanistan, have not been in 
accord with Obamas or the admin
istrations opinions. And he has re
peatedly challenged the President on 
his plan to send more Americans to 
the Middle East. At least, that is what 
we have heard  who has really seen 
Biden recently, anyway?
Mr. Vice President, where have
you been? Mr. Obamas face is ev
erywhere we turn: He is speaking at 
some events and listening at others; 
he is giving the same smile in every 
single photo and wishing he was eat
ing breakfast at Pamelas. But you, 
Mr. Biden, are nowhere to be found. 
Your opinions arent even being giv
en by you; they are being doled out 
in official White House statements.
At this point, we are a bit afraid 
they have you locked in a cage in the 
basement of the White House, possi
bly for fear that you will shoot your
self in the foot with one of your out
spoken and honest trademark gaffes. 
But as you havent even shot anyone 
else, and you havent even gone quail 
hunting, so we think this treatment
might be a bit unfair.
Maybe you are just hard at work, 
bouncing from private meeting to 
private meeting, making everyone 
rethink their own views as you ques
tion their beliefs and plans. We hope 
this is true and we support this be
havior. In the spirit of true journalis
tic curiosity we want you to continue 
to be the devils advocate in the White 
House. The administration that runs 
on change needs a voice questioning 
every new change (and new non
changed plan) that it proposes.
So continue voicing the minority 
opinion, Mr. Biden, and if you are 
not bound and gagged in the White 
House basement, maybe we will see 
you around sometime.
Times layoffs reflect recent media changes
On Oct. 19, The New York Times, 
the newspaper with the largest staff 
in the United States, announced it 
will cut 100 newsroom jobs, or about
8 percent of its total newsroom 
workforce, by the end of 2009. The 
newspaper giant will offer voluntary 
buyoffs, but will resort to layoffs if 
enough staff members do not take 
this option.
Layoffs have already occurred sev
eral times in non-newsroom depart
ments. In the newsroom itself, fewer 
freelancers are being hired, and the 
newspaper has trimmed other ex
penses, according to the Times's 
own article about the layoffs.
This sort of mass staff layoffs also 
happened in the spring of 2008, but 
in that case, other jobs were created
 this isnt the case now. We thought 
the economy was finally recovering
 why are ad revenues continuing 
to drop?
We have to wonder  what will 
happen to Times journalists who, 
while not being technically laid off, 
are just not given stories or other op
portunities to research and write? 
The newspaper and overall media in
dustries are fickle ones for sure, and 
were worried that layoffs of all but 
essential personnel will squander 
the creativity and intellectual free
dom so essential to the success of a 
newspaper.
Its a well-known fact that, in hard 
economic times, the arts are among 
the first to suffer. But world news, 
especially from The New York Times, 
employs more than hobby writers 
and storytellers. The individuals that 
will be laid off or will take buyoff 
packages are professional research
ers and writers. They have honed 
their craft; as readers, we will be 
worse off without them.
The New York Times, and runnerup newspapers like The Washington 
Post, do not currently charge for on
line subscriptions, although a log-in 
identification and password is neces
sary to read a handful of articles on 
each newspapers website. It is quite 
possible  and, in fact, likely  that 
the newspapers will start charging 
for online subscriptions, which have 
risen while printed subscriptions 
have dropped as a result of both the 
economic recession and the digital 
age in general. But if readers have 
to pay to read the newspaper online, 
or put in any extra work at all, will 
they even remain readers for long, or 
will we see the newsrooms dwindle 
further?
Changes to FTC regulations affect Twitter, blogs
Bloggers continued efforts to take 
over the world have been noticed by 
someone in the Federal Trade Com
mission (FTC). In their updated 
Guides Concerning the Use of En
dorsements and Testimonials in Ad
vertising, the FTC details explicitly 
how the pre-existing laws on product 
endorsements affect bloggers.
A portion of the blogosphere is 
up in arms. They shout that they are 
losing their freedom, that they are 
going to get sued and have to pay 
$10,000 per violation, and that there 
is no room in their tweets to fit in the 
required material.
But the examples given in the up
dated FTC guidelines are completely 
in line with what we would expect 
from traditional media sources 
disclosures of free products and 
long-standing financial or material 
relationships with advertisers and 
companies. This clarified guideline 
is not a change to existing law, but 
exists to clarify to consumers (blog 
readers) where bias may exist in 
product endorsements.
These guidelines will also rarely 
affect the average blogger, but allow 
for clarity of enforcement that per
tains to the blogging collectives.
And as for Twitter, based on the 
FTC comment notice, it seems that 
it is being left behind in a legal gray 
area, hiding somewhere between a 
blogging service and a communica
tion network. However, again, the re
finement of these guidelines focuses 
on consumer clarity: If you are being
supported with a constant stream of 
free toys, you should let your blog 
and twitter know.
We arent against these updated 
guidelines; they arent outrageous. 
Blogs need to be fair to consumers, 
and this update is just another push 
in the right direction for bloggers to 
have a few rules they need to follow. 
But to have the FTC realize there is 
something worth regulating, the le
gitimacy of blogs is increased. It is 
one more signal to traditional media 
that they are being replaced.
Please note the Tartan Editorial 
Board is in no way affiliated with 
the Federal Trade Commission, and 
received no free copies of any blogs 
or Internets to assist in the writing of 
this article. Sadly.
Right now, as Im writing this ar
ticle, local officials  lets say, mem
bers of the Carnegie Mellon admin
istration  are standing behind me, 
watching and taking note of every 
letter, every word, every sentence I 
type.
Obviously, the above sentence is 
not true. But if I lived in Britain, this 
scenario would not be nearly so im
possible. Actually, the most absurd 
thing about this scenario happen
ing in Britain isnt even that its well 
within the realm of possibility; its 
that I wouldnt even be at all aware 
that it was happening while it was 
going on.
Called the Regulation of Investi
gatory Powers Act (RIPA), the law 
gives 474 local governments and 
318 agencies in Britain the powers 
that previously only a select number 
of law enforcement and security ser
vice organizations had, according to 
a recent New York Times article. This 
law allows the local governments 
and agencies to film people with hid
den cameras, view communication 
such as phone call logs and web site 
traffic, and hire undercover agents.
And while I do understand that 
in some cases, these added security 
measures are necessary, the powers 
that are now allowable under the 
RIPA are being taken advantage of 
by what seem to be power hungry 
local agencies, acting as bullies, high 
off the new privileges the law gives 
them. In one case that the Times 
article mentions, Jenny Patton, a 
mother of three children, was in
vestigated for three weeks because 
she was suspected of lying about 
her address to get her children into 
a neighboring school.
In the end, Patton was found to 
be innocent, but not until her tele
phone records were scrutinized and 
she and her children were followed 
covertly by an undercover agent, 
all without her knowledge of any of 
these activities.
I have trouble believing that tele
phone records and an undercover 
agent were really necessary in Pat
tons case. Instead of first question
ing Patton when she was under 
suspicion, locals wasted their valu
able time and money following her 
around for three weeks. Were three 
weeks really needed for the officials 
involved to believe that Patton and 
her children really lived where she 
said they did?
In addition to the waste of time 
and money, the case was an inva
sion of Pattons privacy, whether it 
technically was legal or not. Though 
the law may allow local officials to 
use undercover operations, it does 
not mean that these methods need 
to be the first techniques used, es
pecially in generally harmless cases 
such as a mother falsifying her ad
dress. Its one thing to covertly fol
low a suspected dangerous criminal, 
but completely another to follow a 
mother of three.
Local officials and agencies need 
to use common sense first when de
ciding how to investigate each and 
every case, instead of immediately 
jumping to whichever option makes 
them feel the most important. Peo
ples privacy should be protected 
whenever possible and not exploit
ed on an officials or agencys every 
whim.
Heather Tomko (Titomko@J is Forum 
editor and seriously hopes that the 
British government isnt going to start 
covertly following her actions because 
shes written this article.
City should charge college students small tuition tax
Pittsburgh is host to thousands 
of residents who take full advantage 
of the citys services without paying 
any property taxes back to the city. 
Instead of tracking them down, the 
city lauds them as examples of what 
the city has to offer. These residents 
are known as college students.
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
reported last Monday that Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahl was considering 
taxing college students 1 percent on 
theii tuition costs, along with sever
al other unconventional taxes. With 
my opinions on the misguided tax 
on hospital bills aside, taxing Pitts
burghs college students is an inge
nious concept.
Many Carnegie Mellon under
graduate students live on campus in 
dorms. They are paying the universi
ty to live in these spaces, but the stu
dents themselves do not contribute 
any money to the city in the form of 
property taxes. Still, they expect to 
be able to use water andelectricity 
provided by the city and emergency 
response should they set their build
ing on fire by leaving their popcorn 
in the microwave for too long.
Consider also the students who 
foolishly do nothing but homework, 
avoiding putting themselves in the 
real world by slinging burgers at Mc
Donalds or stacking cans at Giant 
Eagle. If students are not working 
real jobs, they are not paying income
taxes, shirking two outlets for con
tributing to a city that coddles them 
like the spoiling mother who lets her. 
son stay with her into his 40s.
Of course, graduate students  
along with a sizable portion of the 
undergraduate population  do live 
in standard apartments, or they may 
even lease houses, separating them 
from the freeloading bums like those 
taking up space in Doherty Apart
ments or Mudge House.
This clearly brings to mind a 
slightly different tax. Rather than a 
blanket tax on all students tuition, 
the city could tax resident students 
on their room costs, bringing these 
inequities at least a little closer to a 
more fair level.
Of course, that would mean that 
resident students would have to pay 
an even higher tax to make up for 
the number of students who would 
be contributing to the city under 
Ravenstahls plan  an option that 
would cause unnecessary uproar 
due to this newly introduced ineq
uity. ,
For the unfortunate student 
working to pay Carnegie Mellons 
nearly $20,000 tuition, every cent 
counts. The $200 is at least a month 
of food that student has to forego. 
Can we get a need-based scholarship 
on our taxes?
Ravenstahls proposition is a good 
one. Now all it needs is a little refine
ment to make it more practical.
Douglas McIntyre fdrmcinty@j 
would gladly write Mayor Ravenstahl 
a check to improve the city.

I hid a love letter in a book for you
Let me tell you more.
Visualize that I am sitting in a 
coffee shop, one that is mostly met
aphorical. It is getting cold, so I am 
drinking hot chocolate and wearing 
a long, dark, and muted olive green 
coat. With me is a book, Traveling 
On One Leg, and I am about 30 pages 
in, but a bit distracted. I pause from 
reading and look around. I am look
ing for someone, but not my friend 
who recommended this book.
This friend, Mr. Engdahl, with 
whom I frequently disagree, provides 
uncultured Americans with an as
signment every year. He selects an ob
scure, normally European, and most 
frequently challenging author, and 
awards them a Nobel Prize. I gloss 
over the details: nominations, short 
lists, his 17 illustrious co-committee 
members, but the moral remains.
Yet this year would be different. 
Mr. Engdahl was replaced as the 
permanent secretary of the Swedish 
Academy by Mr. Englund, and a sec
ond-syllable change brings criticisms 
of the eurocentricity of the acad
emy. The academy was berated as a 
group of Europeans sitting around 
reading the books of other Europe
ans. So this autumn, as the leaves 
begin to litter the ground, we are 
granted not with an unknown, dif
ficult writer from Europe, but Herta 
Mller: an unknown, difficult writer 
from Europe.
Well, I suppose change happens 
slowly. Forsaking a more in-depth dis
cussion of the politics of this choice 
(Mr. Engdahl of course does still sit 
on the academy), I will tell you my 
own story. I went to the library, not, 
as you would have expected, for a 
coffee, but to find Mllers books.
Now although I joke that she is 
not exactly well-known, to most 
readers, most writers are unknown. 
Mller has won a number of prizes, 
some quite large, and not all of them 
German. And as a semi-well-knownAs a sophomore computer science 
major, I had been looking forward to 
the completion and opening of the 
Gates and Hillman Centers since I 
first visited Carnegie Mellon in high 
school. When the buildings opened, 
I was impressed by the amount of 
work and collaboration space avail
able. The reading room on the ninth 
floor and the large student lounge 
on the sixth floor, with its covered 
patio, proved to be excellent places 
to focus on my work or just to sit and 
relax. Spaces like these allowed for 
interaction with others or for indi
vidual work, and it is often hard for 
undergraduates to find such places 
on campus.
After growing used to having 
these resources available, imagine 
my surprise when I tried to reach 
the sixth floor one evening and was 
locked out.
While the third, fourth, and fifth 
floors were still accessible, all other 
floors were locked to my undergrad
uate ID card. This restriction is simi
lar to the one that exists in Newellin-literary-circles writer, she has had 
five of her books translated into Eng
lish. Sure, this is only five out of more 
than 20, and most having been pub
lished by smaller presses, they will 
not be easy to find  there seemingly 
do exist people like me who follow 
the Nobel Prize in literature and are 
now out searching for her books.
And yes, the publishing houses 
are already turning their giant, and 
slow, and rusting gears. As soon as 
the prize is announced, they are ac
quiring rights, and in this case, find
ing translators, and preparing that 
golden seal that will grace the cover 
of each volume: Winner of the No
bel Prize. It is these that will be set 
up in Barnes and Noble, displayed to 
attract the shrinking subculture of 
people who read literature that wont 
ever make the bestsellers lists, of 
people who read real, physical, paper 
and ink books, of people who read.
But I have no need to wait for this; 
I have access to Carnegie Mellons 
own Hunt Library, which, surprise 
you as it may, had four of Mullers 
books translated into English and 
waiting for me. And here is my dilem
ma. Of course, I would like to read all 
of these books immediately, but what 
if, by some chance, some unlucky 
fate, another person at Carnegie Mel
lon would also like to read Mullers 
work? I could not be so greedy as to 
scoop up all of these books.
The answer I struck upon was to 
take three of these four, and in the 
fourth leave a literary love letter. The 
words of it are lost to the page, but I 
felt a need to reach out to you, that 
kindred soul (I will assume there 
is only one of you). You, that other 
person, who chose also to follow the 
advice of the Swedish Academy and 
reach out to a writer who without 
a prize would have remained un
touched on the shelf.
I have since read Nadirs, original
ly published as Niederungen, Mullers 
first book of short stories. It moves 
quickly and without wasted emotion, 
though it is dense and often jumps 
from event to event without warning. 
The stories are, with the exception of
Simon Hall. The difference in this 
case, however, is that the Gates and 
Hillman Centers is built around the 
theory of connections. Blocking off 
floors to a segment of this commu
nity achieves the opposite effect.
I understand that professors and 
graduate students might have a de
sire to add an extra level of security 
around their offices and labs. There 
are areas of this campus to which 
undergraduate students do not need 
access, and I do not argue with the 
locks in, for example, Newell-Simon. 
If there were only offices on the re
stricted floors, there would be no 
problem; however, this is not the 
case.
If the plan all along was to lock 
the sixth through ninth floors, then 
there should not be a student lounge 
on the sixth floor, nor should there be 
workspaces throughout the building. 
While professors and graduate stu
dents have offices in the buildings, 
undergraduates must make do with 
these public spaces. If these are des
ignated faculty or graduate lounges,
the title story, very short, each one 
brutal. Brutal because of a clear truth 
in her storytelling and brutal because 
of their descriptive nature.
If the first step is reading, the sec
ond step is discourse. I need you, who 
would pick up the book I left behind, 
The Land of Green Plums, to meet me 
in this coffee shop. It is there that 
we would discuss her work. A meet
ing for the sake of literary progress. 
I might say the dream sequences are 
unnerving and violent and could be 
swapped for scenes in horror films. 
You might say you were disgusted by 
her frequent cjescription of urine and 
other bodily functions, but that you 
appreciated the sense of hyperreality 
they created.
We might move on to a more me
ta-level discussion, asking if Muller 
should be a more present member of 
the American literature scene. You 
would argue that America needs to 
be more generally aware of the litera
ture of the entire world, escaping the 
Anglo-centric domination of the me
dia. We would agree with Pound that
they should be marked as such, 
and the Gates and Hillman Centers 
should not be touted, as it currently 
is, as an open and revolutionary en
vironment.
These restrictions do not only 
affect students wishing for a work 
space away from the library or their 
cramped dorm rooms. Teaching as
sistants can no longer hold office 
hours in much of the Gates Center 
because undergraduate students are 
not able to attend.
Even if workarounds are in place, 
such as the ability to have a profes
sor remotely unlock the doors, this is 
an inconvenience to those students 
seeking last-minute help on an as
signment.
As disturbing as this new restric
tion is, the fact that it was put into 
place without any notification to un
dergraduate students is even more 
cause for concern. Among the fel
low undergraduates with whom I 
have spoken, those who are aware 
of these new restrictions found out 
either from other students or from
reading in English alone is not nearly 
enough. I would have to admit that it 
was the challenge of the award that 
led me to read her, but that I embrace 
this contest each year.
That is of course the point.
Whether from Mr. Engdahl or Mr. 
Englund, the Nobel Prize serves as a 
challenge to me, that once-a-year re
minder to go out and read something 
new. And maybe that is their plan to 
break the America-locked view of the 
American reader, to get us out read
ing and discussing something new, 
something beyond the horizon of 
what we would normally read. How
ever, I am still waiting for that liter
ary discussion. My letter has thus far 
gone unanswered. I am sitting in that 
coffee shop, pulling my coat a little 
tighter around my waist, and looking 
up from my book, scanning the room, 
looking out the window, waiting.
It has been three weeks, and the 
book is still sitting on the shelf.

trying to access the floors and failing. 
If this change was considered by the 
administration of the School of Com
puter Science and deemed necessary, 
it should have been announced to all 
members of the university commu
nity.
The Gates and Hillman Centers 
are an exciting addition to our cam
pus. The buildings symbolize the 
connections among disciplines and 
within our campus community. It is a 
sad irony that the administration has 
chosen to ignore the potential ben
efits of openness.
That the decisions 'were made 
without informing the undergradu
ates violates the spirit of the build
ings even more. In the more than two 
years remaining to me at Carnegie 
Mellon, I look forward to spending 
time in the new complex, and I hope 
I am not limited to only three of its 
floors simply for being an undergrad
uate.

Students get 
involved in 
Homecoming
DANA WEINSTEIN
I have a problem. Whenever 
someone asks me to take on or ap
ply for a position of leadership in 
an organization, I cant say no.
And thats probably how I ended 
up being the chair of the Student 
Homecoming Committee. I joined 
the committee in the summer be
tween my freshman and sopho
more years because it sounded in
teresting. Truthfully, I didnt know 
that students were supposed to go 
to Homecoming events, but I want
ed to get more involved on campus, 
so I figured it would be fun.
The Homecoming events last 
year went well, and it seemed like 
we reached our goal of raising 
more school spirit on campus, but 
in the back of everyones minds 
we were all still wondering: What 
are we going to do about next 
year? The school year went on 
and we all pushed it to the back of 
our minds until Heather Andring, 
who is in charge of overseeing our 
committee, e-mailed us and asked 
if anyone would be willing to be 
committee chair and take charge 
of student Homecoming. The next 
thing I knew, I was getting an email from Heather telling me that 
she had selected me as the 2009 
student chair.
So now, after six months of plan
ning, Homecoming is finally here. I 
truly believe that the committee is 
accomplishing what it has set out 
to do. While we couldnt have the 
giant white tent on the CFA Lawn 
again, our events this year are 
made to embrace Carnegie Mellon 
and amp up school spirit, recogniz
ing that Homecoming isnt just for 
alumni  its for students too.
Our days during Spirit Week
 Nerd Day, School Spirit Day, 
and Tartan Pride, just to name a 
few  and the Kick-Off BBQ are 
aimed at embracing school spirit. 
Events such as LMAO and the Hal
loween Bash are designed to allow 
students to get a chance to interact 
with alumni while enjoying stu
dent and alumni performances.
Our biggest event, the Highland 
Games, is bringing back an old Car
negie Mellon (and Scottish!) tradi
tion  you can go check out the 
old trophy in Alumni House. The 
Games embrace our schools Scot
tish pride while allowing classes to 
compete with each other in a Car
negie Mellon style competition, 
complete with a Rubix cube com
petition, kilt race, and Cut pong.
If any of this sounds interesting 
to you, show up! Even if you think 
that it doesnt, show up anyway  
you never know what free stuff you 
might end up winning!
Spirit Week starts Oct. 26 and 
runs through the 30th. The events 
begin with the Homecoming BBQ 
Kick-off at the Fence on Oct. 28, 
and end on Oct. 31 with the Hal
loween Bash in Wiegand Gym. Be 
sure to come and check them out 
and show your Carnegie Mellon 
pride.

Fiber Content: Cardio for the winter season
Mens soccer 
dominates 4-1
Soccer wins in 
double overtime
KEVIN SCHULTZ
Special to The Tartan
As the seasons change, so 
do your options for physical 
activity and training; gyms 
and treadmills start to fill up 
and workout times and space 
become a premium.
In order to make the most 
out of late fall, winter, or 
early spring training, flex
ibility within your routine is 
a surefire way to ensure con
sistency.
I have to admit I am stub
born and religiously stuck 
in my exercise routine, and 
anything making me deviate 
from my normal daily physi
cal activity plan is an annoy
ance. To combat this, it would 
be ideal to develop multiple 
workout options.
The ability to develop 
a weekly plan shows fore
thought and commitment to 
increasing health and fitness 
over the winter months. The 
following will outline some 
general training options that 
can be performed in the Uni
versity Centers fitness facili
ties.
Treadmill
As the weather starts to 
turn, most people tend to 
gravitate toward the tread
mills. Treadmill training pro
duces nearly the same energy 
expenditure as running at a 
particular intensity, which is 
why most competitive run
ners train with them.
A challenging alternative 
to regular treadmill train
ing, fartlek training has been 
practiced for years by cross 
country and track and field 
athletes to break up the mo
notony. The concept behind 
fartlek training is to vary 
the intensity and distance at 
random and various times 
throughout a predetermined 
training distance or time (e.g. 
3 miles or 60 minutes).
If you were performing 
this on the city streets of love
ly Pittsburgh, you might start 
out by jogging down Forbes 
Avenue toward Squirrel Hill. 
Once you got to Murray Av
enue, you might take a right 
and increase intensity for a 
block or two until you reach 
your next milestone and 
once again either decrease 
or increase intensity. Look for 
street signs or certain mark
ers to help you pace yourself.
Indoors, this becomes 
tricky. Start out with a time 
or distance of your choice 
based on your previous train
ing experiences, such as 30 
minutes. Begin with an easy 
pace to elevate the heart rate 
and the core body tempera
ture. Concentrate on your 
surroundings to take the 
place of outdoor markers: 
Watch the people around you 
or television.
After about 5-10 minutes
of easy jogging, start your 
fartlek training based on 
your normal habits. Pick a 
piece of equipment near you 
that you can easily watch out 
of the corner of your eye, and 
each time a new person uses 
the equipment, vary your 
speed or the inclination of 
your treadmill through the 
full workout. For the TV, try 
varying the speed or inclina
tion every commercial break 
or scene change. Keep it fun, 
and dont get caught at a 
speed or inclination that you 
cannot handle and injure 
yourself.
Elliptical
This is a great option for 
people who experience lower 
back or knee pain during run
ning. The elliptical is second 
to using the treadmill for en
ergy expenditure. With the 
elliptical, you can also per
form modified fartlek train
ing using the same protocol 
as the treadmill. Also, a way 
to spice up this option would 
be to vary the direction of the 
movement.
Most people use an el
liptical like they would use a 
treadmill  by putting one 
foot in front of the other.
This movement pattern 
is identical to the movement 
patterns seen during walking 
or running, hip flexion fol
lowed by knee flexion, and 
will recruit the respective 
muscle groups (illioposas 
and quadriceps).
Try changing up the 
movement patterns and start 
the motion with hip and knee 
extension. This will primarily 
engage the posterior muscle 
groups, which tend to be 
hard-to-hit areas. The mus
cle groups involved in hip 
and knee extension are the 
hamstrings and the gluteal 
muscles (gluteus maximus, 
medius, and minimus).
During a typical 30-45 
minute cardio session, try 
changing up the direction ev
ery 10 to 15 minutes to work 
both muscle groups and to 
keep you interested.
The next edition of Fi
ber Content will expose you 
to other cardiovascular op
tions to keep you engaged 
and undeterred because of 
overcrowded facilities. Exer
cise options to be discussed 
include stationary/spinning 
bikes, indoor rowers, stair 
climbers, and swimming. Do 
not forget to integrate static 
and PNF stretching into your 
daily physical activity plan.
As with all exercise, before 
you start, consult your physi
cian to gain medical clear
ance.
Please email me if you have 
any questions.

Golf finishes fall season third
GOLF, from A12
Junior Brent Driscoll fin
ished tied for ninth just two 
strokes behind Einhorn at 84. 
Senior Brett Cannaday fin
ished the day in 24th with a 
91, and sophomore Alex Co
hen shota 103.
The Tartans had two in
dividuals who competed in 
the Invitational: Senior Nick 
Burkholder carded an 84 to 
tie for ninth individually and 
first-year Steven Nguyen shot 
a 104.
The Bobcat Invitational 
marked the end of the fall 
season for the Tartans. While 
the Tartans were a very com
petitive team this season, 
they were not completely 
satisfied with their perfor
mance. The team and I came 
into the fall season with high
expectations and did not play 
to our full potential, said 
Cheng. It was an extremely 
disappointing season after 
coming off the best season 
last year. While we graduated 
two starters last year, this 
team still has a lot of great 
players and talent. I believe 
we have the potential to turn 
things around for the spring 
season.
Last year, the Tartans 
took home the their first ever 
University Athletic Associa
tion Championship title and 
survived four rounds at the 
NCAA Championships. With 
some training and determina
tion, they will hope to net the 
same results come spring.
The Tartans will return to 
the links during their spring 
break trip on March 4 in Na
ples, Fla.
Senior Ryan Browne looks to get the 
SOCCER, from A12
in the Tartans last home fix
ture of the year. The game 
had an exciting beginning 
as Haselhoff scored in the 
fourth minute off a deflected 
shot and New York answered 
back seven minutes later.
The Tartans were a little 
shocked with the quick re
sponse, as it was only the 
fourth goal theyd allowed 
since Sept. 15. Nevertheless, 
Carnegie Mellons level of 
play was not disturbed and 
the Tartans were rewarded 
with a second goal.
The calm and cool Griffin 
broke through the New York 
backline and neatly scored 
off a chip shot over the goal
keeper. In the 27th minute, 
Lutz got his third goal of 
the weekend as he blasted 
the ball into the back of the 
net from six yards out. The 
Cardinal and Gray wrapped 
up the game in the second 
half, as the dynamic duo of 
Griffin and Lutz once again 
combined. Griffin was able to 
finish off a low shot to the far 
post to get his team-leading 
17th goal of the season and 
secure the 4-1 win.
The mens soccer team 
will unfortunately be losing 
10 seniors next year, eight of 
whom are starters. However, 
the Tartans have enough tal
ent on the team to be able to 
make up for the loss.

You learn so much from

talented and just inspire you 
to work harder every day. Not 
only do they teach you how 
to be successful on the field, 
they teach you how to be suc

The Tartans are now 13-1 
for the season and are cur

seed in the NCAA tournament 
in order to get home field ad

Men's soccer is 4-0 for UAAs
The number 9 ranked Tartans are undefeated in UAA competition, with a 13-1 season record overall.

The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team continued their 
remarkable run last week as 
they defeated conference ri
vals Brandeis University and 
New York University. The 
team currently sits at number 
9 in the NSCAA/Adidas Divi
sion III Rankings with their 
13-1 record and are 4-0 in 
University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) conference play.
The Tartans came out flying 
right from the kickoff against 
Brandeis, testing Judges goal
keeper Matt Lynch with five 
shots before finally scoring
in the ninth minute. Senior 
forward Pat Lutz received a 
pass from fellow senior Ryan 
Browne, dribbled by the last 
defender and scored off a shot 
to the near post. Carnegie 
Mellon continued to press af
ter the goal but gradually the 
pressure died down and the 
rest of the game was played 
mostly in the midfield. Bran
deis most dangerous players, 
Alexander Farr and Jaime Ba
tista, were shut down by the 
rock-solid Carnegie Mellon 
backline. Senior goalie Maks 
Khurgin was hardly tested and 
only had to make one save the 
entire match. Despite the dy
ing pressure, Lutz continued
to give Brandeis problems as 
he was constantly running at 
the Judges defense, stealing 
balls and creating chances. 
His efforts earned him a third 
UAA Athlete of the Week 
award and a second Eastern 
College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) Player of the Week 
honor. The match ended 1-0 
as the Tartans picked up their 
sixth consecutive shutout. 
Two days later, Carnegie Mel
lon faced New York Universi
ty. It was all about the seniors 
that day, as seniors Keith 
Haselhoff, Ricky Griffin, and 
Lutz all got on the score sheet

Mens and womens tennis has strong showing at nationals
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens tennis teams 
had strong representation at 
the ITA National Small Col
lege Championships held in 
Mobile, Ala., with two teams 
taking fourth in doubles play: 
seniors James Muliawan and 
Niko Ljuboja, as well as soph
omore Laura Chen and junior 
Ashley Herrick. Chen also 
made the singles draw for the 
tournament and placed fourth 
overall. This tournament con
cludes the season for both 
teams.
The ITA nationals mark the 
second appearance for Mu
liawan and Ljuboja, who made 
the tournament in their first 
year. This time, the duo won 
their first match against a Lu
ther College team with a little 
trouble, but triumphed in the 
end 6-4,6-4. Despite a strong 
win, the two were unable to 
repeat the previous days re
sults and fell in the semifinals 
to Andrew Thomson and An
drew Lee of Middlebury Col
lege, 6-1, 6-3. For the playoff 
match, Muliawan and Ljuboja 
faced a duo from Ithaca Col
lege. After losing the first set 
4-6 and winning the second
6-4, the Tartans fell in the tiebreak to take fourth place.
I guess our result is okay; 
I wish we could have done 
better, but its been fun, Mu
liawan said of his fourth place 
finish. I made singles last 
year and doubles in my fresh
man year, so three out of four 
years isnt bad.
I had a fun time playing 
with James, and Im glad we 
were able to make nation
als our senior year, Ljuboja 
stated. This trip was a lot of 
fun, and Im glad I was able to 
spend some quality time with 
other people on the team. Its 
nice to start my senior year the 
same way I started [my fresh
man year]: making nationals. 
For the womens side, Chen
and Herrick beat Emorys 
Lorne McManigle and Zahra 
Dawson 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 1-0 
to advance to the semifinals. 
The Tartans next faced Jackie 
Shtemberg and Felice Trinh of 
the College of New Jersey, but 
fell 6-3, 1-6, 1-0 (9-7) after 
a long and grueling battle. 
Determined to do better in 
the next match, the Tartans 
overpowered the first doubles 
team from Redlands Univer
sity, 64, 6-2 to take third.
I think that there were a 
lot of good people in the tour
nament, so I guess losing to 
good competition isnt as bad, 
Chen remarked. Its always 
very disappointing to lose, but
I like to think that since the 
matches were close that they 
could have gone either way. 
Losing to tough competition 
just makes me want to work 
harder.
I had a great experience 
going to Alabama for the first 
time, Herrick added. Laura 
and I had to perform at our
best in order to be competitive 
in every match, but it was re
ally fun having the opportuni
ty to compete against some of 
the best teams in the nation.
Chen also competed in 
Singles play, with this being 
her second year making ITA 
nationals after placing sec
ond last year. The first round 
proved to be a warm up for 
Chen, who only dropped three 
games against her Trinity Col
lege opponent 6-2, 6-1. In 
the semifinals, Chen faced 
the University of Chicagos 
first-seeded Kendra Higgins. 
After dropping the first set
4-6, Chen rallied back to win 
the second set by a margin of a 
couple points, 7-6 (6). Unfor
tunately Higgins regrouped in 
the final set to win 46.
The tennis teams will re
sume play in the fall. With 
such strong representation 
in this tournament, both the 
mens and womens teams are 
expected to be an intimidating 
force to other opponents.

University on Oct. 11. The 
Tartans record is now 6-5-2 
overall and 1-1-2 in UAA 
play.
Carnegie Mellons loss to 
the Bears was only their third 
shutout loss of the year, and 
their offense could muster 
little more than two shots on 
goal by junior Emily Over

sophomore Elsa Wu scored 
the teams only goal to secure 
the tie. She now leads the 
team with six.

Earle Swank chosen 
to be dean of men
MAY 6,1959
Mr. Swanks appointment 
is effective July 1, at which 
time he will reactivate the of
fice of dean of men, the duties 
of which have been handled 
during a four-year interim 
period by various university 
officials.
As chairman of the Stu
dent Financial Aid Committee 
for the past three years, Mr. 
Swank has had frequent op
portunities to become familiar 
with the students at Carnegie 
Tech. He has been administer
ing the various scholarship 
and loan programs and has 
been advisor to foreign stu
dents.
English
A member of the Carnegie 
Tech faculty since his appoint-- 
ment as instructor of English 
in 1948, Mr. Swank now holds 
the title of assistant professor 
of English and will continue 
his work in that department.
Mr. Swank received his 
A.B. degree from Muhlenberh 
in 1943, and an M.A. from 
Harvard in 1948.
The naming of a new dean
of men caps an investigation 
of over 70 candidates for the 
position. When the post was 
vacated four years ago, the 
administration decided to al
locate various responsibilities 
of the office to several other 
departments at Tech. The 
recent expansion of duties 
of some of these offices has 
made it necessary to once 
again centralize the duties of 
the dean of men.
Mr. Swank is unmarried, 
the son of the late Harry
E. and Georgia J. Swank of 
Tamaqua, Pennsylvania.
Hunts to give Tech new library
File Photo
An artist proposed a design for the soon-to-be built Hunt Library. The actual construction took on a very 
similar appearance.
OCT. 29,1958
On Tuesday, October 28, 
President Warner and Mr. 
James Bovard, chairman of 
the Board of Trustees, an
nounced at a press confer
ence that Mr. and Mrs. Roy A. 
Hunt have given Tech a gift of 
$2,800,000 for the construc
tion of a new campus library.
Also revealed at this time 
was the fact that construc
tion of the supposed Activities 
Center is to begin early next 
spring. Dr. Warner stated that 
it is hoped that the plans for 
the Activities Center will be 
ready for bids in January.
The new Hunt Library of 
steel framing with alumi
num facing will be located in 
the space now occupied by
Skibo, the present focal point 
for student campus life. One 
outstanding feature of the 
Hunt Library will be a 10,000 
square foot penthouse which 
will house the valuable rare 
botanical book collection of 
Mrs. Hunt. The penthouse 
will be surrounded by a prom
enade and rows of trees and 
shrubs.
Needed Space
This gift of the Hunts will 
provide much needed space 
for our presently overcrowded 
libraries, as well as a means for 
integrating the seven existing 
libraries. The Hunt Library 
is designed to accommodate 
350,000 books in the library 
proper, plus another 125,000 
in basement alcoves.
A sub-basement will provide additional storage and 
file space. Since the library 
collection is now approxi
mately 147,000 and the an
nual gain each year is 8,000 
volumes, the library will ad
equately provide for expan
sion in volumes in the next 25 
years.
Facilities
There will be space for 
readers, collections, and oth
er library facilities, as well as 
special student group-study 
rooms and small seminar 
rooms.
Mr. Hunt, chairman of the 
executive committee of the 
Aluminum Company of America, is a senior board member 
of CIT and a vice chairman of 
the boards executive commit
tee.
Carnegie Tech receives twin research grants from N.S.F.
MARCH 25,1959
CIT announced the re
ceipt of two research grants 
amounting to $113,700 from 
the National Science Foun
dation last week. The grants 
are for the support of basic 
research in the department 
of physics and the Metals Re
search Laboratory.
Dr. Sergio De Benedetti, 
Professor of Physics, will di
rect research in the field of 
Positronium Studies in Sol
ids and Liquids, for which he 
was given a grant of $66,300. 
Another grant of $47,400 
was awarded for the study of 
Equilibrium Measurements 
in Reactive Metal Systems at 
High Temperature, under the 
supervision of Dr. Charles L.
McCabe, Associate Professor 
of Metallurgical Engineering.
Dr. De Benedetti has been 
active in research on positrons 
and the positronium since 
coming to Carnegie in 1949. 
Positrons are electrons of pos
itive charge which associate 
with the usual negative elec
trons to form positronium, 
an atom similar in structure 
to the hydrogen atom, but 
almost two thousand times 
lighter. These particles can be 
used as a probe to investigate 
the internal structure of mat
ter.
The grant was made by the 
National Science Foundation 
to further current studies on 
the behavior of the positro
nium in matter, including its 
chemical properties.
Dr. McCabe has been at 
Carnegie since 1952, when he 
joined the faculty as a mem
ber of the Metals Research 
Laboratory.
The new grant will enable 
him to study the behavior of 
liquid metals for which there 
is no known crucible mate
rial.
This study will be made 
through the exploitation of a 
laboratory technique known 
as levitation melting, which 
was pioneered at the research 
laboratories of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation 
in Pittsburgh. This technique 
uses an electrical heater 
which melts and suspends the 
metal in a coil so that physical 
chemical experiments can be 
performed.

Theta Xi takes first place in fraternity Booth competition
 File Photo
Students gather outside second-place Kappa Sigmas The Abduction of Helen of Troy" booth. Midways 
notorious steals theme was creatively transformed into a variety of games.
MAY 6,1959
Saturday night at the 
Spring Carnival formal, Theta 
Xi was awarded first place for 
fraternity booth design. Led 
by booth chairman, Howard 
Schafer, the TXs worked their 
theme Ali Baba and the 40 
Thieves into an excellent 
Arabian booth. The game 
consisted of rolling three balls 
into three holes on a moving 
oriental carpet. If this was 
accomplished, a prize was 
awarded from an opened cave 
such as Ali Baba once opened
with the words, Open Sesa
me. The oriental theme was 
heightened by the Turkish 
dress of the TXs who ran the 
booth.
Kappa Sigma Second
Second place was award
ed to Kappa Sigma for their 
booth, The Abduction of Hel
en of Troy. Under the chair
manship of Laird Sinions the 
booth was built to resemble 
a Greek temple and featured 
a shooting game. Crossbows 
equipped with rubber ar
rows were furnished to shoot 
at Greek soldiers. If a soldier
was hit, a doll representing 
Helen was released. If the doll 
fell into one of the boats that 
was moving by, a prize was 
awarded.
Beta Theta Pi and booth 
chairman, John Crecine, re
ceived the third place award 
for their booth centered 
around a Captain Kidd theme. 
The booth featured the tradi
tional I Ducked a Beta game 
but with a new twist. The Beta 
who sat aboard a ship was 
ducked if the rudder of the 
ship was hit by a wooden peg, 
shot from a real cannon.
To Banburg Cross
FEB. 25,1959
During the past year there 
has been a growing feeling 
among intelligent and articu
late members of the Press in 
Washington that the position 
of the United States in the 
world has never been lower 
since the end of World War
II as it is at this time. This is 
naturally attributed to the age 
and infirmity of the adminis
tration, its obsession with mi
nor issues, and its caution in 
moments of extreme crisis.
Real as these are, it seems 
possible that the cause of our 
present sorry state is not in 
the tired and ill man in the 
White House but in the vig
orous popular hero who took 
office six years ago. Dwight 
Eisenhower came upon the 
scene, a commonsense sort 
of man with a nice face and 
a hundred percent humble 
background, at the critical 
moment, and backed by a 
highly professional and effi
cient publicity machine was 
swept into office with more 
than thirty million votes and 
the general goodwill of the 
American People.
This nation, faced by two 
great Communist-dominated 
enemies, and caught in a 
vast upheaval of nationalist 
and revolutionary sentiment 
among the have-nots nations 
of the world, needed in its 
foreign policies a positive ap
proach enlarging and finally 
supplanting the policies of 
containment which proved 
adequate for the late nineteen 
forties.
We were promised and we 
needed: political initiative
in areas such as Asia and the 
Arab States; flexibility in pol
icy to account for variations 
both historical and regional; a 
Point Four program increased 
one hundredfold; increased 
U.S. economic action through 
[the] World Bank, Colombo 
Plan, and other international 
agencies; and a thoroughly 
revised tariff system, more 
cognizant of the trade needs
of both ourselves and other 
nations.
Within our own boundar
ies, we found ourselves grow
ing fat and complacent in a 
boom economy, and scarred 
by divisions of prejudice and 
fear. We were promised and 
we needed programs to meet 
the needs of the population in 
housing, schools and colleges, 
city renewal, transportation, 
the production and distribu
tion of food, inexpensive pub
lic power, conservation and 
public health. In Civil Rights 
we were promised and we 
needed bold and constructive 
programs for the protection of 
the negro citizen, for the pro
tection of both management 
and labor from hoodlumism 
and organized mobsterism, 
for the protection of the rights 
of Indians and migrant work
ers, and for the liberalization 
of our immigration policies to 
meet the needs of the worlds 
homeless.
But Mr. Eisenhower was to 
have offered us more than just 
new faces and efficient ad
ministrators to carry out this 
vast program. He called for a 
new morality in government 
and a stern devotion to the 
American Ideal on the part 
of the public. He offered and 
we needed: to fight the rule 
of fear and the growth of McCarthyism, to place the entire 
truth of our situation before 
the nation, to cultivate an at
titude of willing sacrifice to 
meet the needs of the times, 
and to support with ever in
creasing vigor the growth of 
the U.N.
What is left now of all these 
noble promises? The new po
litical initiative has become 
farcical in our refusal to recog
nize in China the established 
government of eight hundred 
million people, and tragical in 
Hungary where we could not 
back up our propaganda with 
action. Our vaunted programs 
of economic aid have been re
vealed as woefully inadequate 
by Mr. Nixons reception in 
South America. We have a
transportation problem con
sisting of a negative approach 
to airport construction, an ig
noring of the plight of the rail
roads, and a highway program 
out-moded before it is off the 
drafting boards and lacking 
the necessary protections 
against billboards and other 
commercial intrusion. We 
have initiative in Civil Rights 
taken by the Supreme Court 
and only half-heartedly sup
ported by the Administration. 
We are misled and misguided 
by our leaders as to the depth 
and intensity of our failures, 
and are completely without 
information of the effects of 
continuing H-bomb testing. 
And we are told that our small 
sacrifices are done in enlight
ened self-interest rather than 
in a true spirit of caritas.
On every hand the pro
grams promised have emerged 
from the political and social 
arenas only as token answers 
to the needs, which have be
come more urgent than ever 
in the incredibly swift trans
formation of the world. The 
killers and the spoilers of 
these programs are the men 
of special interests in finance, 
private power, labor, farming; 
they are the mighty fighting 
in defense of their entrenched 
power; they are the average 
citizens bemoaning taxes 
while buying new cars and 
appliances; they are the lazy, 
eager for what they do not 
earn; they are the individuals 
of the nation, concentrated 
upon themselves, their com
forts and their pleasures.
But in 1952 Dwight Eisen
hower had the power and the 
opportunity to weld the Amer
ican People into one strong 
unit, willing, and therefore 
able, to meet without selfish
ness and hesitation the de
mands of the past decade. We 
would have followed him if he 
had asked us to do so. It is his 
tragedy, and the worlds, that 
he had neither the knowledge* 
the courage, the willingness, 
nor the stamina to exercise 
true Leadership.

1968-1969
October 26, 2009  The Tsrtan thetartsn org * B3
MARCH 14,1969
WASHINGTON  United 
States Senator Richard S. Schweiker introduced a Consti
tutional Amendment to lower 
the voting age to 18 in federal, 
state and local elections.
In a Senate speech introduc
ing his resolution, Schweiker 
said, I feel that our young 
men and women between 18 
and 21 are informed enough 
and mature enough today to 
be entitled to cast their votes. 
He stated, We can not only 
gain the important benefit of 
their views; we can also give 
them a voice within, not with
out, our political system.
Schweikers resolution is
identical to the resolution sub
mitted in 1967 in the House, 
when he was a Congressman.
Schweiker said, If we are 
going to treat 18-year-olds as 
adults in many other areas, 
we should also treat them 
as adults in our political sys
tem.
He cited service in the 
armed forces, adult court sys
tems, contract liability, and 
freedom to leave school as ex
amples of adult treatment of 
18-year-olds.
Schweiker said some young 
people have acted in less pos
itive ways, and he said, One 
of the reasons for some of this 
has been that socially-minded 
men and women have been
cut off from the electoral pro
cess.
Schweiker also argued that 
because of the recent popula
tion explosion, an increas
ingly large percentage of our 
population now consists of 
young adults between 18 and 
21, which means that an in
creasingly large percentage of 
our population is disenfran
chised from the vote. ,
Schweiker cited arguments 
that 18-year-olds are not 
ready for the vote, but said, 
the record of most young 
people shows that this is just 
not true.
He said, I am sure that all 
the members of the Senate 
have visited high schools or
colleges, and had the expe
rience of coming away with 
great respect and pride in the 
quality of the students, in the 
intelligence of their questions, 
and in the high degree of con
cern they have for the condi
tion of the world today.
He added, In particular,
18 is the age when our young 
people are graduating from 
high school, and when their 
interest in public affairs is 
peaking. By giving them the 
vote at this time, we can take 
advantage of this peak in in
terest, and encourage them to 
participate even more in our 
electoral system, and not dis
courage this interest by deny
ing them a vote.
ORGANIZATION SEEKS TO LOWER VOTING AGE
During the recent national elections, President John
son and major political candidates endorsed the lowering 
of the voting age to 18. The basic premise underlying the 
endorsement is that in a democracy all those who help to 
bear the burdens of society should share in the decision
making. Make It Eighteen is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
organization dedicated to lowering the voting age to 18.
Americans between the ages of 18 and 21 certainly 
help share the burdens of society, Make It Eighteen as
serts. Many young adults have full employment and a 
surprising number hold part-time jobs. They pay federal, 
state, and local taxes [that] contribute to many com
munity projects. The vast majority of men in the Armed 
Forces are not old enough to vote.

to Lower Voting Age,published in the Nov. 20, 1968 edition of

Johnny 
Folsom
SEPT. 25,1968
Prisoners are the greatest 
-audience that an entertainer 
can perform for, says Johnny 
Cash in the liner notes he has 
handwritten. Perhaps after 
hearing the response Cash re
ceived from these guys, other 
artists might be inspired to 
play the prison circuit. To put 
it mildly, the album is very 
exciting, even more excit
ing when it is realized that it 
took six years to convince the 
Columbia record executives 
that this kind of artist and 
audience relationship might 
prove successful.
Johnny Cash, a long-time 
country and western star, has 
been playing Folsom Prison 
for years. Though not a for
mer resident himself, he ob
viously has the warmth and 
compassion to speak their 
language. He clowns with 
them, swears a bit and is in
credibly honest with the in
mates.
It is the combination of 
the songs and Cashs perfor
mance that makes this album 
great. Of the sixteen num
bers on the record, five were 
written by Cash, including 
the opening Folsom Prison 
' Blues. The songs have an im
mense appeal to this unique 
audience, but the album is of 
such a nature that the listener 
outside of Folsom will empa
thize too.
One song, Twenty-Five 
Minutes to Go, tells of a man 
on death row experiencing 
the last moments of life right
Cash at Prison
up until the actual hanging. 
Dirty Old Egg Sucking Dog 
and Flushed From the Bath
room of your Heart are nov
elties having little or nothing 
to do with prison  more 
evidence of the intelligence 
shown by both Cash and pro
ducer Bob Johnston.
Two of the best songs on 
side two are Give My Love to 
Rose  a devastating num
ber about a man released 
from prison found dying on 
the railroad tracks, never 
having made it back to his 
wife and ten-year-old son  
and I Got Stripes, a raucous 
ditty about a guy who man
aged to commit a crime, get 
caught, arrested, convicted 
and imprisoned in a week. 
The last selection is one that 
was sung for the first time 
by Cash the night before this 
album was made. It is called 
Greystone Chapel and was 
written by George Shirley, an 
inmate at Folsom.
The technical aspects of 
the disc are excellent. With its 
release, Columbia (notorious 
for imperfect surfaces and 
general defects) has made an 
important contribution to the 
record industry this year. But 
it is Cash who must be given 
most of the credit. It is he, an 
almost exclusive country and 
western artist, who has risen 
above this limited market 
with a brilliant idea. It is he 
who has done the memorable 
performances and given the 
Folsom Prison inmates a great 
time. The album is available 
only in stereo CS 9639.
Fire guts Kappa Sigma [house]
Freshmen women request no hours
NOV. 6,1968
The freshmen women are 
following in the footsteps 
of their predecessors, the 
sophomore class. At a meet
ing Monday night, October
30, forty freshmen voted to 
circulate a petition request
ing no hours, with parental 
permission.
The petition, if signed by a 
majority,'will be submitted to 
AWS for their consideration, 
after which the signatures 
will be forwarded to the ad
ministration. This was the 
procedure the sophomore 
women followed in their suc
cessful attempt for no hours.
The issue was fully dis
cussed before a final petition 
was approved by a majority. 
After preliminary comments 
that the request should be 
initiated and activated by the 
freshmen without a push by 
other classes, the freshmen 
discussed the universitys role 
in loco parentis.
College students should 
be capable of self-discipline, 
was the opinion of most of 
 those who attended. It is the 
individuals responsibility to 
keep up with her work, one 
girl added.
Others expressed their 
opinion that the university 
should not be concerned with 
what you do as long as it does 
not affect them. Only aca
demic affairs should concern 
the school.
The questions of whether 
hours should remain for the 
first semester, or mid-semester, was then raised. Most 
agreed that there is no dis
tinction between a girls atti
tude first and second semes
ter. Therefore, if you need 
hours one time, you probably 
need them all the time.
If you feel you need 
hours, that you need the dis
cipline, you can have them. 
But dont deprive others. 
That men do not have cur
fews was mentioned as an 
example of the double stan
dard.
It was decided to circu
late a petition requesting no 
hours with parental permis
sion, effective immediately, 
to all floors. There are 252 
freshmen women.
The administration was 
praised for their handling of 
the issue of no sophomore 
hours. The freshmen hoped 
that [they] would be granted 
the same privilege.
Firefighters arrived at the Kappa Sigma house in the early morning to put out a major blaze. The 20 brothers were displaced to Mudge House 
temporarily. *
DEC. 18,1968
Shortly before 6:00 a.m. 
December 14, fire engines 
were summoned to a six alarm 
blaze at Kappa Sigma frater
nity.
Twenty fraternity members 
and their house mother, Mrs. 
Gretchen Hart, were forced 
into the cold. Most wore only 
night clothes. Firemen battled 
two hours to get the blaze un
der control, and it continued 
to burn as late as 10:00 a.m.
As the fire continued, Dean 
Swank and Mr. Thomas began 
to arrange food, lodging, and 
other emergency measures. 
The homeless men are cur
rently lodged in Mudge House. 
They were given two hundred 
dollar emergency loans to 
help replace the clothing lost 
in the fire.
Two of the Kappa Sigma 
residents were rescued from a 
third story ledge. Craig Pollack 
and Dave Stermole, both from
New York State, were taken to 
Shadyside Hospital for treat
ment of smoke inhalation.
Fire Chief Harry Keller 
stated that the fire [began] in 
a second floor sleeping area. 
The cause is still undeter
mined.
An unconfirmed report 
ruled out arson as a possible 
cause. The Chief estimated 
damages at $75,000.
Dean Swank said that the 
house is no longer liveable, 
and any attempts to salvage 
it must be delayed until an 
inspection can be made to 
determine the safety of the 
building.
The fire has prodded ef
forts to initiate construction of 
the new fraternity house com
plex. Bids were opened last 
Tuesday. After all original bids 
exceeded budget limitations, 
specifications were subjected 
to minor revision and a rebid 
announced.
The contractor will be un
der a rather stiff bond to 
have shells completed by midDecember 1969.
The Tartan was informed 
by Dean Swank that at this 
time (Sunday, December 15) 
arrangements for housing the 
fraternity until the new build
ing is completed are uncertain. 
The school must determine 
what housing with appropri
ate living and social space it 
owns in the area.
The school cannot insure 
the contents of the house. It 
can only insure property in 
which it has equity. The fra
ternity was attempting to find 
out what insurance it owned, 
but was encountering difficul
ty due to people being out of 
reach during the weekend.
The house was built in the 
late 1800s, and was known as 
the Shiller mansion. President 
Doherty bought it in 1937 for 
a student activities center. The 
house had served C-MU as a 
student union, faculty club,
and administration building.
Dean Swank mentioned 
that other fraternities were 
warned to exercise extreme 
care in decorating their hous
es for Christmas, and to take 
extra precautions to keep their 
buildings clean and safe.
The fire reduces to two the 
number of old houses in the 
fraternity system. Beta Sigma 
Rho lost their house in a fire in 
late April 1966. Sigma Nu and 
Theta Xi houses will probably 
be demolished as soon as the 
new complex is occupied.
If the Kappa Sigma house 
cannot be restored, the cam
pus planning architect will be 
asked to study alternate uses 
of the land.
Dean Swank noted that 
if Doherty House didnt oc
cupy the adjoining land, the 
site could have been used for 
a new housing complex. Un
der present conditions he de
clined to speculate about pos
sible use.
Nixon appoints Stever task force head
File Photo
Carnegie Mellon president H. Guyford Stever was selected for a prime 
Washington role by President-Elect Nixon. Stever expects the task force 
to influence many areas of the government.
DEC.11,1968
H. Guyford Stever was re
cently appointed by PresidentElect Nixon to head a task 
force on science. The purpose 
of the committees study is to 
give [the] incoming adminis
tration recommendations for 
courses of action in the field 
of science. The appointment 
came as a complete surprise, 
of course, to President Stever. 
He was called by an old friend, 
Henry Lumis, who is an aide 
to Nixon. Membership of the 
committee is classified infor
mation at present, but Dr. Ste
ver did say that the committee 
membership is an impressive 
[roll] of men in many fields 
of science. Friday saw the first 
meeting in Washingtons Na
tional Academy of Science. 
Over the next three weeks,
the committee will prepare 
their report for the President. 
Their job is terminated at the 
deliverance of that report. 
From there it will be for the 
new president to utilize the 
recommendations of his own 
staff. Dr. Stever said, that no 
matter what your politics, this 
is an opportunity for men of 
science to contribute to a new 
administration and sciences 
role in it.
Conceivably, the report 
from Dr. Stever [will] com
bine with Nixons other task 
forces to mold the new admin
istration. Education, space, 
foreign aid and other areas of 
interest to the Federal Govern
ment will all feel the influence 
of technology as presented in 
Stevers report. More specifi
cally than that, Stever would 
not comment.

60 MINUTES ticks into psych, dept. Sorority booths hit by vandalism
B4thetartan.org _ _______ _____ __________________________^ _____ The TartanOctober 26,2009
FEB. 27,1979
File Photo
Spilled paint covered the floor of Delta Delta Deltas storage area for Booth. The sorority was one of several to 
suffer attacks against their booth supplies during a major bout of vandalism.
Last Thursday, Harry Reasoner, nationally renowned 
newscaster and one of four 
hosts of CBS 60 MINUTES, 
came to Pittsburgh to inter
view CMU psycho-pharma
cologist, Dr. Klaus Miczek.
The interview and film of 
a staged experiment will be 
part of 60 MINUTES' second 
segment on drugs and their 
effects, to be broadcast next 
month.
Reasoner and Dick Clark, 
producer for 60 MINUTES, 
were interested in Miczeks 
experiments with mice and 
rats in which Miczek found 
that a single, low dose of mar
ijuana causes a very drastic 
decrease in aggression, with
out altering general health, 
motor coordination, eating or 
sleeping habits.
According to Reasoner, 
the objective of this segment, 
which focuses on marijuana 
legalization, is to inform 
the public about the current 
thinking, from both sides, of 
scientists and sociologists.
Reasoner stated the aim of 
the first broadcast (one month 
ago) was to inform the view
ers of the incredible amounts 
of marijuana being brought 
into the country and the large 
numbers of adolescents smok
ing marijuana.
He explained that in the 
second broadcast, 60 MIN
UTES will be doing investiga
tive work paralleling mari
juana legalization and the 
ending of Prohibition. If the 
situation is the same as it was 
with Prohibition, there is no 
point in trying to keep people 
from doing this, Reasoner 
suggested in explanation of 
the broadcasts purpose.
Dr. Miczeks experiments 
interested the 60 MINUTES 
s0aff berause pf 01e pp0en02al 
rprrela02pn be0ween 01e labp
ratory results and adolescent 
be1av2pr w201 resper0 0p mar2
juana use. (60 MINUTES' re
search team found out about 
Miczeks work through a news 
release sent from CMUs PR 
department to a national PR 
firm in Boston.)
Miczek believes, based on 
the results of extensive tests 
on laboratory animals, that 
many recreational drugs, 
including marijuana, do not 
cause aggressive behavior, 
and in most cases, can actual
ly cause users to become less 
violent  even if taken on a 
regular basis.
Miczek has studied the ef
fects of cocaine, marijuana, 
amphetamines, and alcohol 
on colonies of rats, mice and 
squirrel monkeys. By putting 
these animals in attack situa
tions  where a new animal 
of the same species is placed 
in with an established colo
ny  Miczek observed the 
normal aggressive actions of 
the resident attacker, usually 
the king male of the colony 
(TARTAN, January 16,1979).
In a fourth-floor lab in Bak
er Hall, Reasoner and Clark 
questioned Miczek about his 
experiments. They asked, 
Could you draw any conclu
sions about marijuana use and 
adolescent behavior, based on 
your experiments?
Miczek replied, No. I am 
not ready to do that. The ex
periments would not allow for 
extrapolation on the effects 
and behavior of 13- or 14-yearolds who use marijuana.
My experiments are on 
animals, and while they sug
gest some implications for hu
mans, there is no proved cor
relation between the two. 
The primary reason for 
the lack of proof, Miczek 
explains, is that one cannot 
observe the situation of self
administration of marijuana
 animals do not self-admin2s0er mar2juana.
Tp draw any rprrela02pn, 
every ppss2ble asper0 mus0 
be pbserved and, 2n real20y,
you cant get animals to take 
marijuana. In contrast, it is a 
totally different picture when 
experimenting with cocaine 
[on monkeys], for example, 
because the drug is placed in 
the cage and the situation of 
self-administration can be ob
served, Miczek asserted.
An experiment with rats 
was staged for the 60 MIN
UTES crew to film. Clark 
asked if the before and af
ter results would be obvious 
enough for viewers to observe 
extremes of behavior. Miczek 
replied that it would be over
doing it  to expect to see 
fighting and then the absence 
of fighting, after the THC in
jection.
While the camera crew 
was setting up, Reasoner ex
plained that the 60 MINUTES 
investigation is being done 
with the intent of giving peo
ple a basis for making up their 
minds. If marijuana [were] 
to be legalized, smugglers 
could be put out of business 
and there would be some form 
of quality control. On the 
other hand, regular marijua
na smoking is not a good idea. 
Any kind of mind-altering is 
not. Legalization would mean 
some increase in usage.
In the first broadcast it was 
pointed out that of 16 million 
marijuana users, 4-5 million 
are between the ages of 15 
and 17. Mizceks work inter
ested the segments producer, 
Clark, because it was a pos
sible step toward understand
ing the effects of marijuana 
usage on adolescents.
When asked about what 
possible effect the 60 MIN
UTES news-documentary on 
marijuana could have on US 
legislators, Clark responded, 
Either outlaw marijuana and 
enforce the law or legalize it. 
Meager efforts are presently 
be2ng made to accomplish

APRIL 10,1979
Early Saturday morning, 
a maintenance worker dis
covered that the basement 
of Morewood D-Tower had 
been vandalized. An initial 
inspection found that six 
windows had been smashed, 
a housekeeping office was 
broken into, three washing 
machines were overturned 
and a fire hose was turned on. 
Furthermore, the area where 
sororities and SDC store their 
booths [was damaged].
This occurrence is the 
latest of a recent rash of 
vandalism that has mainly
MG tower
JAN. 23,1979
The long-awaited plan for 
the renovation of Morewood 
A and B Towers is finally com
pleted. The plan, released last 
week by Bill Dillon, Director 
of Auxiliary Services, shows 
that the towers will have two 
new lpunges pn every flppr 
along with new bathrooms 
and 2mprpved emergenry ex
its. It w2ll be a new building 
when everything is done, 
Dillon asserted.
The plan details how the 
A and B Towers will be con
nected on every floor. To con
nect the towers new lounge 
spaces will be created out of 
existing rooms and the cur
rent lounges will be rebuilt 
into living spaces. The final 
plan does not change the total 
occupancy of the two towers, 
but it does increase the num
ber of bathrooms.
Due to a shortage of funds, 
only a portion of this plan will 
be completed during this sum
mer. According to Dillon, only
focused on the sororities. Sev
eral weeks ago, Kappa Kappa 
Gammas booth was damaged 
in the basement. On April 2, 
a large amount of lumber be
longing to Delta Gamma was 
stolen. The lumber was later 
discovered in the wooded 
area behind Doherty House. 
CMU Security Sergeant Armand Castelli speculated that 
if a group on campus had sto
len the lumber, they threw it 
in the woods to get rid of it 
because it was clearly marked 
DG.
Castelli said that Security 
has added extra patrols to help 
keep the booth equipment
$250,000 is available this 
year to renovate Morewood, 
and he has no idea how far 
the funds will go. His primary 
concern is the connection of 
the two towers. After that is 
completed, priority will go 
to construction of new bath
rooms.

coming from a grant the Uni
versity received from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). 
The HUD funds are from a 
program that makes grants to 
renovations that will reduce 
the energy consumption of 
buildings. The new electrical 
work will include the installa
tion of fluorescent lighting in 
all rooms of Morewood Gar
dens.
Dillon estimates that it will

there is no one working in the 
basement from midnight to 7 
a.m. Castelli also added that 
all the incidents were prob
ably, but not necessarily, done 
by the same people.
One Tri Delt said that 
when she came into More
wood on Friday night, the 
main door was propped wide 
open and no one was sitting at 
the desk.
The Tri Delts are making 
an itemized list of their dam
ages and will give it to Hous
ing Director Gerald Dalton, in 
hopes that Housing will reim
burse them for their losses.
million dollars to completely 
renovate all of Morewood. 
Due to the limited budget, he 
estimates that it will take at 
least five years before all of 
the work is done. Along with 
the shortage of funds, Dillon 
explained that by spreading 
the project out over several 
years, all of the work sched

completed by 1981. Then, de
pending upon available funds, 
all of the bathrooms will be 
replaced during 1981 and 
1982. Other work to be done 
includes a completely new 
heating system throughout 
Morewood, probably in 1981. 
Finally, the complete elevator 
system is to be replaced at a 
cost of over $1 million.

Dr. Simon busy since honored [with Nobel prize]
OCT. 24,1978
Last Monday, Dr. Herbert Simon, 
the R.K. Mellon Professor of Com
puter Science and Psychology, was 
named the winner of the 1978 Nobel 
prize in economics. Since then, Dr. 
Simon told the TARTAN, Ive spent 
an awful lot of time on the phone.
Receiving interview requests from 
almost every major news service in 
the country and many publications 
elsewhere in the world, Dr. Simon 
said he has been busy speaking to 
everybody and everybodys aunt. 
He also has received scores of con
gratulatory telegrams and letters, in
cluding one from President Carter.
I was extremely happy to hear 
from people I havent seen or heard 
from in years. Dr. Simon said, It 
felt good to know that people are 
thinking of me. I got a telegram from 
someone I knew fifty years ago, and I 
even got some telegrams from people 
I dont know at all.
Dr. Simon plans to try to get back 
to business as usual, but he will be 
busy for the next few weeks writing 
his speech for the Nobel ceremonies 
set for this December. Dr. Simon is 
looking forward to going to Stock
holm to receive the prize. But af
ter receiving a wire from the Nobel 
committee that left some questions 
unanswered, he joked, I dont know 
whether theyll be paying my plane 
fare, or whether I can just deduct it 
from the loot. 
The loot is $165,000.
While winning the Nobel prize 
ranks high on Dr. Simons list as a 
most memorable moment in his life, 
there was one day he can remember 
that was more exciting. On Decem
ber 15,1955,1 was working on a logic 
theorist program and we finally got it 
running. It was then that we knew 
that we had a computer that could do 
our research.
Commenting on his being singled 
out for the Nobel prize, Dr. Simonsaid, The problem with a prize like 
this is that scientific research is a so
cial process, and information is often 
passed around. Of the seven Ameri
cans who have won the prize, three 
of us were directly associated in Chi
cago. Two others were closely associ
ated.
There is a long list of people who 
contributed or were involved in the 
decision making work, including Dick 
Cyert and Yuji Ijiri here at CMU. The 
Nobel committee sometimes picks 
out one person as a symbol for the 
whole effort. I was a little surprised 
that the Nobel committee didnt have 
any co-winners with me.
The Nobel Academy said, Modern 
business economics and administra
tive research are largely based on Si
mons ideas, but Dr. Simon felt that 
he was too far from the mainstream 
of economics to be named a winner.
Deep down, I didnt really think it 
was going to happen, he said.
Dr. Simon has been developing his
theories on economic decision mak
ing and then extrapolating them to 
the broader area of psychological re
search into human thinking. He said 
that his impact on business was sim
ply introducing more realistic theo
ries of decision making in business, 
but his impact has spread into many 
other disciplines as well.
Compared to Aristotle by Presi
dent Cyert at a press conference last 
week, Dr. Simon spent twenty years 
researching the actual processes of 
creativity used by people when they 
produce works of art. He and some of 
his colleagues have already produced 
programs that are creative after the 
human creative process was simu
lated on the computer. Dr. Simon 
has conducted pioneering studies in 
this aspect of cognitive psychology, 
seeking a scientific understanding of 
the processes people use in thinking, 
problem solving and creating new 
ideas.
In 1975 Dr. Simon shared the pres
tigious A.M. Turing Award of [the] As
sociation for Computing Machinery 
with CMU colleague Allen Newell for 
their fundamental contributions to 
the fields of artificial intelligence and 
the psychology of human cognition. 
He was one of the founders of CMUs 
Computer Science department, now 
generally recognized as one of the 
top three departments studying the 
computer in the nation.
In 1968 Dr. Simon was appointed 
by then-President Lyndon Johnson as
the first social scientist to serve on the 
Presidents Science Advisory Panel. 
The following year, he received the 
Distinguished Scientific Contribution 
Award from the American Psycholog
ical Association.
Dr. Simons interests span a vari
ety of academic disciplines, reflecting 
the inter-relationships of the social 
sciences, and the application of in
formation processing to both real-life 
problems and research into the func
tioning of the human mind.
Now sixty-two years old, Dr. Si
mon came to CMU, then Carnegie 
Tech, in 1949 as Professor of Admin
istration, after serving as Chairman 
of the Department of Political and 
Social Science at Illinois Institute of 
Technology. He served as Associate 
Dean of the Universitys Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration 
from 1956 through 1973.
Educated at the University of Chi
cago, Simon has been granted hon
orary degrees by the University of 
Michigan, Yale University (Sweden), 
Erasmus University (Netherlands) 
and McGill University (Canada). He 
has lectured extensively throughout 
the country, and, as evidence of his 
diverse interests, served as associate 
editor of journals in economics, po
litical science, and sociology while 
teaching management and organi
zation at CMUs Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration.
Last December Dr. Simon deliv
ered the Richard T. Ely lecture at
the annual meeting of the American 
Economic Association. Titled Ra
tionality as Process and as Product 
of Thought, the address focused on 
recent developments in the theories 
of decision making and problem solv
ing as they are related to economics 
at a conference held in October 1977 
at CMU.
Dr. Simon has authored or co-au. 
thored more than a dozen books in
cluding Human Problem Solving, The 
Sciences of the Artificial, The Shape of 
Automation, The New Science of Man
agement Decision, Models of Man and 
Organizations, and several hundred 
articles for scholarly publications. He 
is a member of the National Academy 
of Sciences, a Fellow of the Econo
metrics Society, and holds member
ships in many scientific and profes
sional organizations.
A sought-after advisor, he has 
served as consultant to a number of 
business and governmental orga
nizations, the RAND Corporation, 
and the Presidents Science Advisory 
Committee, and is a member of the 
Universitys Board of Trustees.
Dr. Simon lives with his wife Dor
othea, a former faculty member at 
the University of Pittsburgh and now 
a research associate in CMUs Psy
chology Department, on Northum
berland Street in Pittsburgh. He has 
three grown children, Katherine, Pe
ter and Barbara. Dr. Simon was born 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on June 15, 
1916.

University considers ways to fix the Fence
SEPT. 27,1988
As most students already 
know, one of the Fence's bot
tom crossbars has been broken 
since the beginning of the aca
demic year.
For the past two weeks, the 
crossbar has been propped up 
by cinder blocks. The cinder 
blocks were put in place by Phi 
Kappa Theta fraternity while 
they held the Fence from Sep
tember 3 to September 17.
Because of the tradition 
represented by the Fence, the 
University is attempting to 
obtain as much student input 
as possible before making a 
decision about how to fix it. 
Student Ombudsman Michael 
Murphy and Student Body 
President Andy Robitshek
have scheduled a meeting 
regarding the Fence for 4:30 
p.m. on October 4.
According to Murphy, The 
purpose of the meeting will 
be to explore the options. 
The site of the meeting has 
not been set, but Murphy said 
that anyone who is interested 
in attending should call him at 
268-2991.
Murphy plans to open the 
meeting to anyone who wishes 
to attend unless the number 
of people becomes too large. 
Those who cannot attend but 
wish to contribute ideas are 
invited to call Murphy or Ro
bitshek. Robitsheks phone 
number is 268-5495.
Murphy plans to investi
gate various options for one 
or two weeks and then present
them to the University com
munity for feedback. There 
is no target date to have the 
Fence fixed, but Murphy said, 
There seems to be agreement 
on all corners that something 
needs to be done ... by the end 
of October.
University Architect Paul 
Tellers said it is not yet known 
how much of the Fence will 
need to be replaced. The cross
bar is the only part broken at 
the moment, but Tellers said 
he has heard that the posts 
may be in bad shape as well.
The Fence was built by the 
Carnegie Tech class of 1923 as 
a meeting place for seniors. 
Senior Vice President Edward 
Schatz said when he arrived 
on campus in 1939 as a fresh
man it was still known as the
Senior Fence and underclass
men were not allowed to sit 
on it. He says students had al
ready begun painting it at that
time.
Schatz saiid that the Fence 
has been repaired before in its 
65 years of existence. In fact,
he believes that it is possible 
that no piece of the original 
Senior Fence remains in the 
current Fence.

painted, earning it a place in the Guiness Book of World Records.
Carnegie Mellon finalizes School of Computer Science creationUniversity Center [construction] postponed indefinitely
JAN. 24,1989
In a move to assert its lead
ership in the field of Comput
er Science, Carnegie Mellon 
officially created the School 
of Computer Science on De* 
cember 1. SCS is little more 
than a reorganization of the 
formerly existing Department 
of Computer Science, and will 
be headed by Nico Habermann, the past head of the CS 
department.
In 1965, the Department 
of Computer Science was cre
ated under the Mellon College 
of Science. In 1985, that de
partment was removed from 
MCS and given independent 
status, with the stipulation 
that it would remain a depart
ment for a trial period of two 
or three years before it was 
promoted to a college.
Provost Angel G. Jordan 
commented, The [CS] de
partment prospered extreme
ly well. It prospered so well 
that it actually grew, was en
larged, became prominent, 
and later, pre-eminent.
Jordan said that Habermann is going to need two or 
three associate deans which 
de facto have already been ac
tive. When he was department 
head, he was already dean, be
cause of the size of the school 
and the components of the
program. Now some people 
who were helping the depart
ment head will be appointed 
associate deans.
According to Jordan, CMU 
was one of the first universi
ties to create a department in 
the field of computer science 
back in the sixties and today 
is one of the first to give it full 
college status. Computer Sci
ence has for years at Carnegie 
Mellon University been more 
than just a little discipline in 
a conglomerate of colleges, 
Jordan said.
The new school will in
clude the components of the 
old department, as well as the 
Robotics Institute, the Cen
ter for Machine Translation, 
and the Information Technol
ogy Center, a CMU/IBM joint 
project responsible for the fa
miliar Andrew system.
However, SCS will not be 
organized into departments.
Ph.D. degrees in computer 
science and robotics and in
telligent systems, and new MS 
degrees in-computer science 
and software engineering will 
be offered by the school.
In addition to these grad
uate programs, SCS will 
continue to jointly offer an 
undergraduate degree in 
mathematics/computer sci
ence through the Department 
of Mathematics in MCS.
However, the new school 
is still only a graduate school. 
Since theres already an un
dergraduate computer sci
ence option in mathematics, 
the idea is to work closely with 
the Department of Mathemat
ics in making a joint program 
in mathematics and computer 
science, explained Jordan.
Jordan cited other areas 
of the university where the 
School of Computer Science 
would be collaborating with 
other schools and depart
ments. He mentioned com
putational physics, chemistry, 
and biology in MCS, compu
tational linguistics in H&SS, 
and the Center for Art and 
Technology in CFA as likely 
collaborators with SCS.
Habermann explained the 
reasoning behind the forma
tion of SCS: Information 
processing has added an ex
tra dimension to the pursuit 
of science, while also being a 
separate discipline for study. 
With the advent of economi
cal personal computers and 
workstations, along with 
networking, computer sci
ence has become the tool of 
thought.
The School of Computer 
Science is Carnegie Mellons 
third graduate school, joining 
GSIA and [the School of Ur
ban and Public Affairs].

The School of Computer Science is now housed in the Gates and Hillman Centers. Numerous accolades have 
come to Carnegie Mellon due to work in SCS.
FEB.21,1989
Construction of the new 
University Center, one of the 
central features of the master 
plan, has been indefinitely 
delayed due to a lack of funds 
for the building in the Capital 
Campaign.
Paradoxically, however, 
the Capital Campaign itself is 
doing well.
President Richard Cyert 
admits that the main problem 
is that most of the donors who 
are giving to the Campaign 
are earmarking their money 
for other projects. Specifi
cally, new professorships and 
other educational grants are 
the primary interests  not 
new construction.
The postponement of the 
University Center comes al
most three semesters after the 
release of the Task Force Re
port on the Quality of Student 
Life on November 24,1987.
Construction of the pro
posed University Center 
should commence at the ear
liest possible time. The notion 
of the Center... is one that has 
been embraced almost univer
sally by the campus communi
ty, the report said. Not only 
are expectations high, but the 
protraction of this project will 
have a chilling effect on all 
other steps ... that are taken 
to enable Carnegie Mellon to 
reflect the virtually limitless 
potential of its constituency.
Student Government 
President Andy Robitshek em
phasized the importance of 
the University Center for stu
dents. The University Center 
is the number one concern for 
students, he said.
The problem with fundraising for the University 
Center persists. There has 
been no great support for the 
University Center, said Vice 
President for Development 
Alvin Brannick about the do
nations.
Cyert agreed. The Uni
versity Center does not have 
strong appeal. That doesnt 
bother me; we still have to 
keep hammering away.
According to Brannick, the 
Capital Campaign is currently 
moving ahead of schedule. 
Were past the midway mark 
in the Campaign, at about 
$130 million, said Brannick.
The fundraisers goal, ac
cording to Brannick, has been 
to get a prospect interested 
in giving money, and then 
narrow the focus to a specific 
project. He emphasized that 
the University Center is a top 
priority when talking to the 
donors.
Robitshek disagreed, how
ever. They say that they need 
a major donor for the Univer
sity Center, he said, but they 
have not targeted for a major 
donor. It has not been an em
phasis.
Cyert projects that the 
Campaigns goal of $200 mil
lion will be met by the April 
19, 1991 deadline. So far, the 
needed $30-$35 million for 
the Center is only at about the 
$500,000 mark, according to 
Brannick. We havent given 
up on [the Center], said Cy
ert.
Brannick stated that most 
of the gifts have come from 
sources the Campaigns orga
nizers did not consider at first. 
Were just now beginning to 
start on the big prospects, 
said Brannick. He hopes that 
withy these prospects, large 
funds directed for the Center 
may be obtained. Our best 
days are ahead, he com
mented.
If a separate campaign 
solely for the University Cen
ter is needed, Brannick proj
ects that one might be sched
uled to begin near June 30, 
1991, after the Capital Cam
paign and at the end of the 
schools fiscal year.
Aside from the major do
nors wanting their money to 
go to other projects, delays 
and other problems for the 
master plan also stand in the 
way of the University Center.
Brannick said that when 
the University Center plans 
were first being laid out, al
lowances for housing and 
parking were not taken into 
account. There have been a 
lot of twists and turns in the 
master plan, he said.
Brannick admits that the 
new dorm, football field, and 
parking lot have caused prob
lems for the master plan in 
that it has had to keep expand
ing its focus. Housing became 
a concern when city residents 
began complaining about 
students living in off-campus 
housing. Also, parking, a pe
rennial problem at CMU, got 
even tougher when the city 
further limited the schools 
access to legal parking. Weve 
really been dealing with eight 
capital campaigns, said Bran
nick, Things would be easier 
if we did not have a whole list 
of [projects].
Another factor for the 
Centers delay is the current 
state of construction on the 
East Campus Project. Were 
further off schedule than we 
thought we would be five or 
six years ago, said Brannick. 
In the course of the master 
plan, the East Campus Project 
must get finished, he said.
Even with all of the un
foreseen problems that have 
hindered the University Cen
ter and the master plan as 
a whole, Brannick stated, 
Weve done very well man
aging this type of conglomer
ate [project]. He added that 
if the master plan had kept its 
scope limited, some opportu
nities to help the school even 
more may have been missed.
Cyert is expected to make 
a formal statement about the 
issue in the next month.
Information network unveiled [on campus] CheSS computer
NOV. 1,1988
The campus-wide infor
mation network was unveiled 
yesterday in'Hunt Library.
According to Operations 
Director of University Rela
tions Timothy Basinski, the 
terminal placed in Hunt Li
brary will be a beta test unit. 
This machin will be used to 
test out the network and find 
any bugs it may contain.
After a test period, the net
work will be modified and up
dated. Once deemed operable 
the machine will be released 
campus-wide to areas of high 
visibility.
Each terminal is made 
from a Macintosh SE, a touch 
screen and a hard disk drive. 
The terminals will be placed 
in some type of case to insure 
their security.
The kiosk, as develop
ers have named the network, 
features a campus events cal
endar, a campus map, and 
campus news. The calendar 
is shown on the screen like a 
normal monthly calendar. In 
order to find out which events 
are taking place on a given 
day, a person pushes on the 
screen on that given day.
It is possible to find out 
more information about any 
given event simply by pressing 
on that event. The kiosk has an 
option that allows a person to 
locate where an event is taking 
place on the campus map.
The map shows an aerial 
view of the campus. There 
is a little hand that shows a 
person where he is located on 
the map. It is possible to find 
the name of each building by 
pressing on it. Some informa
tion, such as what is located 
in the buildings, is also avail
able. The kiosk also offers Uni
versity related news.
The need for the informa
tion network was document
ed in findings of the Quality 
of Life Task Force. According 
to a memo, dated February 
16, sent to Director of Busi
ness Services Stephen Schillo, 
...although the campus offers 
a large, rich varied set of ac
tivities, the vast majority of 
students dont attend because 
they hear about the events too 
late.
The information kiosk has 
been under consideration and 
planning since February of 
this year.
Basinski stated that the 
beta test unit cost about 
$10,000 to produce and the 
funding came from President 
Richard Cyert.
The network has been un
der development since about 
April. According to student 
and Desk Top Publishing Con
sultant Brian Harrison, origi
nally the network would have 
been made of IBM PS/2s and 
would have been non-interac
tive and constantly scrolling.
Harrsion suggested the 
touch screen Macintoshes, 
which cost about half the val
ue of the originally suggested 
terminals.
The information kiosk is 
also accessible over the cam
pus AppleTalk network. There 
are also plans to allow access 
from the library network.
The network is run jointly 
from University Relations and 
Student Affairs. In order to 
get events placed on campus 
events it is necessary to go 
through the office of Public 
Relations.
Other sites at which the 
network will be located are: 
Skibo, Baker, Doherty, Ham
burg, Wean, Warner, Morewood Gardens, Mellon Insti
tute, SEI, CFA, GSIA, Scaife 
Hall, and the gymnasium.
The term kiosk is a Turkish 
or Persian term that refers to 
a pavilion.

Sesame Street meets Forbes Avenue
Officials appoint vice provost
AUG. 31,1998
Why are you putting up 
with this? Im so boring! said 
Indira Nair to her students in 
the middle of teaching a Ra
diation, Health, and Policy 
lecture 10 years ago. She did 
not know it at the time, but 
re-evaluating education was 
to become her full-time job.
Nair, who h$s been a CMU 
faculty member for 20 years, 
was appointed vice provost for 
education by a search commit
tee in late July. Former Vice 
Provost Ed Ko resigned last 
April to take a position at the 
City University of Hong Kong.
Since being appointed, 
Nair has spent much of her 
time in meetings with other 
CMU administrators, such as 
Bill Elliot, vice president for 
Enrollment, and Jeff Bolton, 
vice president for Planning 
and Business.
Ive been learning a lot 
from each person about what 
my job entails and how it min
gles with theirs, said Nair. 
Their assistance, Nair said, is 
helpful as she adjusts to her 
new position.
[My job description is] to 
promote the cause of educa
tion. What does that mean? 
Its nice to go back and ask 
yourself fundamental ques
tions about what it means 
to broaden education, said 
Nair.
Nairs responsibilities in
clude helping implement the 
Universitys Strategic Plan, 
which was re-evaluated last 
year. Ive been trying to un
derstand the motivations be
hind it and also some of the 
wording, said Nair. She was 
not involved in the forma
tion of the plan, so therefore 
she has been consulting some 
of the same administrators 
about the history behind the 
Strategic Plan. One of the 
statements [the Strategic 
Plan] makes is that we have 
to deliver extraordinary value 
to the students. But what does 
that specifically mean, and 
how do you do it?
Part of the plan calls for a 
broadening and balancing of 
students educations. As asso
ciate head and associate pro
fessor in the Department of 
Engineering and Public Policy 
(EPP), Nair has been active 
in doing just this since she 
arrived at CMU. EPP is a ma
jor that engineering students 
may take in addition to their 
primary major. Its purpose is 
to balance engineering stu
dents educations by urging 
them to think critically about 
the ways technology and soci
ety are interlinked.
One thing that greatly 
concerns me, said Nair, are 
students who graduate from 
Carnegie Mellon and auto
matically choose to work for 
the highest bidder without 
thinking about the moral 
and ethical consequences. 
Students need to think about 
their principles and ideals 
and then ask themselves, Am 
I giving and using my knowl
edge for the things that I be
lieve in? 
Nair originally came to 
CMU in 1978 after seeing a 
classified advertisement for a
temporary position. Her origi
nal intentions were to work 
at CMU while she continued 
to try to find a real job. But 
instead, Nair was named the 
assistant department head a 
year later. She became asso
ciate department head and a 
senior lecturer in 1981.
In a statement to the Uni
versity, President Jared Cohon and Provost Paul Christiano noted Nairs importance 
in the development of EPPs 
curriculum.
Nair earned her bachelors 
degree in physics and math
ematics from the University of 
Bombay in 1960, her masters 
degrees in physics first from 
the University of Bombay 
and then from Kansas State 
University, and her Ph.D. in 
physics from Northwestern 
University in 1972.
A popular teacher among 
students, Nair said she regrets 
that her new appointment will 
not allow much time for a role 
she has taken since she was 
young. In her native India, 
she was the eldest of four chil
dren and always felt a natural 
pull towards teaching. There 
were always younger children 
around. Id help them with 
homework just because I was 
older, Nair said.
Nair feels that the true re
wards as an educator come 
10 years down the road when 
a thank you letter from a for
mer student arrives in the 
mailbox. A true test of a 
good education, she said, 
is whether or not you can 
retrieve the knowledge when 
you need it.

Nobel Prize winner 
returns to CMU
NOV. 2,1998
SEPT. 14,1998
Cs for Carnegie, that's 
good enough for me....
Last Thursday evening in 
Rangos Hall, the Children's 
Television Workshop brought 
Sesame Street Unpaved, a 
celebration of 80 years of suc
cess of the childrens program 
Sesame Street, to CMU. Over 
400 CMU students, faculty, 
and staff, as well as visitors 
from the Pittsburgh commu
nity came to see the unprec
edented behind-the-scenes 
view of Sesame Street.
The presentation was de
signed primarily for college 
students, especially television, 
film, education, and commu
nication majors. It provided 
a chance to learn more about 
the educational mandates, 
animation, story-telling, and 
other components that con
tribute to the development of 
each show.
Sesame Street Unpaved 
is a way for us to give [some
thing] back to you, those who 
grew up watching Sesame 
Street," said Rosemarie Truglio, director of research for 
Sesame Street and the modera
tor for the evening.
I just felt it was the kind 
of program that would have 
broad appeal, said Anne 
Witchner, assistant dean of 
Student Affairs, who had been 
planning since April to bring 
the program to CMU. The ap
peal is so great  from a stu
dent who is the avid TV view
er, to the student who wants to 
do this as a career.
Last Thursdays program 
featured a question-and-answer panel of four members 
who work with Sesame Street 
in different capacities. One 
member of the panel was Steve 
Whitmire, a principal pup
peteer with The Jim Henson 
Company. Whitmire joined 
the company in 1978, almost 
right out of high school.
I was just an obsessive fan, 
who was fortunate enough to 
have it channel into a career, 
said Whitmire.
With the death of Jim Hen
son, he began the puppeteering of characters such as Kermit the Frog and Ernie. During 
Sesame Street Unpaved, 
Whitmire and Kermit the Frog 
entertained the audience, as 
Kermit made jokes and faces 
and exhibited well-known 
quirks as he sat in Whitmires
lap.
During the time for open 
questions from the audience, 
Maria Renzelli, a 1997 gradu
ate of the University of Pitts
burgh, shared with the panel 
and audience her story of the 
day her mother went into la
bor and her then-three-yearold sister told her mom she 
wanted the baby named Ma
ria since Maria on Sesame 
Street was really pretty and re
ally nice.
I have been told that story 
every birthday for as long as I 
can remember, said Renzelli. 
Meeting the real Maria was 
something I never thought I'd 
do.
The audience was very 
responsive. They sang along 
with well-known Sesame 
Street songs and laughed at 
familiar episodes  the pro
gram closed with a 20-minute 
clip video of the past 30 years 
of the show. At the end of the 
presentation, all those in at
tendance received a Sesame 
Street character doll.
I think that it was very suc
cessful and am pleased that we 
were able to bring this event to 
campus, said Witchner.
Students from all majors,
from drama and musical com
position to engineering and 
education, attended the pro
gram for various reasons.
My older sister actually 
saw the first episode of Sesame 
Street. It is a mix of personal 
and professional reasons [for] 
being here, said Chris Cum
mings, a senior drama major 
interested in television pro
duction.
Louis Ransom, a first-year 
student in H&SS, was also a 
student in the audience, but to 
him the program had a differ
ent meaning. When Ransom 
was four years old, he began 
playing the part of one of the 
children on Sesame Street, 
which he played for a year and 
a half.
My dad worked at the 
Pittsburgh Courier, and they 
took pictures of me which 
were sent out to talent agen
cies and modeling agencies, 
said Ransom. The pictures not 
only landed him auditions in 
various commercials, but also 
an audition for Sesame Street.
Ransom remembered how 
before the shows he would get 
to play with the other kids. He 
had the opportunity to work 
with the actors and actresses,
Not long ago, the Royal 
Swedish Academy of Sciences 
announced that John Pople, 
formerly a professor of chem
istry at CMU, would be a re
cipient of a Nobel Prize for his 
work in quantum chemistry. 
In 1986, Pople moved on to a 
professorship at Northwest
ern University and formally 
retired from CMU five years 
later; he currently teaches at 
the University of California at 
Santa Barbara but found'the 
time to come back to CMU to 
celebrate his accomplishment 
with friends and colleagues 
here. Although he was only in 
Pittsburgh for a short time last 
week, The Tartan managed 
to catch up with him to talk 
about his accomplishments 
in the field of chemistry as 
well as his personal interests 
beyond the world of atoms, 
molecules, and quantum dy
namics.
as well as the puppeteers. 
According to Ransom, they 
were each given a couple of 
lines and were always told to 
be themselves, be vibrant, be 
talkative, and just have a good 
time.
It makes me feel real 
proud that I got to be a part of 
it, said Ransom. Everybody 
has at least one memory from 
a Sesame Street episode. Its 
amazing to see that one show 
has touched so many people.
Sesame Street Unpaved" allowed the Carnegie Mellon community to 
interact with the Sesame Street cast.
The Tartan: When you first 
found out you won the Nobel 
Prize, what was your immedi
ate reaction?
John Pople: I was some
what overwhelmed. I thought 
that much of the credit should 
go to the people who worked 
with me in the field because 
much of what I worked on was 
based on other peoples work, 
so really, it was recognition of 
the field Im in.
7T: How did you first be
come interested in chemistry?
JP: I was a mathematician 
as a student; after I complet
ed my undergraduate work, 
I looked for a field where 
mathematics would be use
ful. Around 1948, chemistry 
was such a field. Theory and 
mathematics have made a big 
impact on chemistry in the 
past few years.
7T: What have you missed 
most about CMU since you 
left?
JP: My wife and I were al
ways fond of the city of Pitts
burgh as a place to live. We 
like the countryside in West
ern Pennsylvania as well  
there are not as many hills in 
the Chicago area
We enjoyed living in Pitts

leagues here, and we miss the

interaction with them.
TT: How does CMU now 
compare to how it was when 
you left it?
JP: The Mellon Institute 
has not changed a great deal. 
I havent seen much of the 
rest of campus, but last year I 
did visit the new [University] 
Center. It seems like theres a 
lot more activity than when I 
was here; the school has re
ally blossomed in the past 30 
years.
TT: What sort of things do 
you like to do outside of your 
work?
JP: My wife and I travel a 
great deal. We visit Europe ev
ery summer, and weve been 
to Australia nine times. I like 
to travel. Often, its in connec
tion with my work, but we like 
to move around the world.

you been?

in Ireland.
Ive also attended many 
science conferences in various 
countries in Europe.

Whats it like down there?
JP: Its a very empty coun
try. There are large stretches 
of undeveloped land, but 
there are also active and in
teresting places.
Its interesting because 
its a developing place. West
ern Australia is the size of 
Europe, but it only contains

Fraudulent money managers embezzle university funds
MARCH 2, 2009
Carnegie Mellon lost nearly $50 million to 
two money managers who spent a chunk of 
the cash on teddy bears and other luxuries, 
according to a Securities and Exchange Com
mission (SEC) lawsuit filed last Thursday. The 
potentially irretrievable 5 percent loss to the 
endowments value hits the university in a year 
already expected to produce significant finan
cial setbacks due to global re
cession.
We do not yet pos
sess sufficient informa
tion to estimate with 
confidence the likely 
timing or extent of our
potential recovery of our investment, said Car
negie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon, in an 
e-mail statement last Thursday.
Federal authorities arrested and charged 
Manhattans Westridge Capital Management 
firm operators Paul Greenwood and Stephen 
Walsh last Wednesday for misappropriating 
over a half-billion dollars from Carnegie Mel
lon, the University of Pittsburgh, and other 
investors, according to the SEC complaint.
Carnegie Mellon and the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, who 
together invested over $115 
million with the firm, had al
ready filed a lawsuit against 
Westridge with the United 
States District Court for the 
Western District of Pennsyl
vania on Friday, Feb. 20.
This investment [with 
Westridge Capital] was high
ly recommended to the uni
versity by one of our external 
consultants, Wilshire Associ
ates Incorporated, said Teresa 
Thomas on behalf of the uni
versitys Media Relations in an 
e-mail.
The Wall Street Journal re
ported on Thursday that, in 
addition to Wilshire Associ{ ates, Cambridge Associates 
' and Mercer Investment Con
sulting also offered glow
ing reports about Westridge 
Capital Management Inc. to their 
clients, including universities, pub
lic school systems, and retirement 
foundations across the nation. Kim 
Shepherd, spokeswoman for Wilshire, told 
the Journal that her firm undertook typical 
diligence in Westridges case, reviewing audit
ed financial statements, regulatory filings, and 
bank account records before recommending 
the firm.
These consultants are retained by the uni
versity to, among other things, provide exper
tise and perform substantial due diligence, 
including with respect to operational, systems 
and strategic aspects of the investments 
they recommend, Thomas said.
According to the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission 
lawsuit, filed in the U.S. 
District Court for the 
Southern District of New 
File Photo York on Feb. 25, Green
wood and Walsh misappropriated approximate
ly $553 million of approximately $1.3 billion 
in overall pool participants funds. They used 
new pool participants funds to cover up prior 
losses, and used over $160 million for personal 
expenses, including rare books at auctions, 
horses, collectible Steiff teddy bears bought for 
as much as $80,000 at various auctions includ
ing Sothebys, and a $3 million residence for 
Walshs ex-wife, Janet Walsh.
Hes done wonders for the town; this is 
a very tragic situation, said Cynthia Curtis, 
chairman of the local planning board in North 
Salem, N.Y., of Greenwood to The Wall Street 
Journal. Greenwood serves as the affluent, ru
ral, 5000-strong Westchester County towns su
pervisor, the equivalent of mayor, according to 
the Journal.
He and Walsh are also ex-owners of the New 
York Islanders hockey team.
Westridge Capitals malfeasance follows 
months of mounting and interrelated finan
cial catastrophes contributing to a gloomy in
vestment climate for the university, from Bear 
Stearns collapse to Bernie Madoff and Robert 
Stanfords billion-dollar Ponzi schemes, through 
bailouts and stimuli, multi-trillion-dollar bud
gets, credit crunches, and housing crises.
Cohon predicted in a Jan. 23 statement to 
the campus community a 30 percent decrease 
in endowment value due to global recession, 
with slow recovery thereafter. The message 
came three weeks before the National Futures 
Association (NFA) alerted the university that it 
had suspended Greenwood and Walshs mem
bership to its regulatory organization due to 
their failure to cooperate with an audit. Carn
egie Mellon then contacted the NFA, the SEC, 
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commis
sion for assistance, and asked Westridge for full 
redemption of its $49 million investment with 
the firm.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Fri
day that legal experts expected the university to 
be unable to recoup its losses from Greenwood 
and Walsh.
Robert Strauss, professor of economics and 
public policy at Carnegie Mellon, told the PostGazette that he expected the endowment to 
take beyond the rest of his career to recover, 
characterizing its downfall due to fraud and 
recession as radical. The loss assails Carnegie 
Mellon as a salary freeze looms for the July 1,
2009 through June 30, 2010 fiscal year. The 
university will also implement campus-wide 
department cutbacks to adjust to the global 
downturn.
It is more likely that the impact, if any, will 
be felt in future years, Cohon said in his e-mail 
statement, referring to the $50 million loss.
Despite circumstances, Carnegie Mellon 
economics professors, officials, financial aid 
administrators, and trustees expressed nearunanimous confidence in the universitys finan
cial stability throughout a series of interviews 
with The Tartan over the past two weeks about 
the schools fiscal well-being. It was unclear by 
press time how much Cohon and other officials 
who spoke with The Tartan knew about the suit 
with Westridge, which the Post-Gazette first re
ported on Wednesday.
Westridge is an unrelated matter, Thomas 
said in response to questions about Carnegie 
Mellon officials recently expressed optimism in 
the face of a global recession now colliding with 
a one-time $50 million loss.
[President Cohon] has reassured us all, via 
the [e-mail to the campus community], that we 
are moving quickly and aggressively to protect 
the universitys assets, Thomas said.
She did not clarify the extent of officials 
knowledge of the Westridge situation, although 
several top-level administrators had spoken 
with The Tartan about the schools fiscal health 
one week after the NFA first alerted the univer
sity of potential problems with their Westridge 
investment.
She did reaffirm the confidence expressed 
by several officials, including Cohon, prior to 
the Westridge suits in the universitys financial 
well-being.
She added that, unlike others on our cam
pus, [President Cohon] has not engaged in 
speculative comments, about the combined 
effects of a global downturn and the Westridge 
misappropriation on the universitys fiscal sta
bility.
Not including the Westridge losses, a poten
tial 30 percent drop predicted for the year in 
the endowments annual draw would result in 
a 1.8 percent annual operating budget hole (30 
percent of 6 percent), according to Thomas.
At some other institutions, a comparable 30 
percent drop in their endowment draw might 
generate a 12 percent annual operating budget 
deficit that is far more challenging to fill, she 
said, not indicating whether an additional 5 
percent loss to Westridge would be addressed 
through further cost cutting, in addition to the
5 percent cuts to academic units by 2012 with a 
minimum reduction of 2 percent in 2010, and 
10 percent by 2012, with a minimum reduction 
of 2.5 percent in 2010 for administrative units 
that Cohon described in his Jan. 23 e-mail.
Steelers win one for the other thumbScotty brings out spirit 
around campus
FEB. 2, 2009
Yesterday, two franchises 
on different ends of the Su
per Bowl winning spectrum 
met in Super Bowl XLIII. The 
Pittsburgh Steelers won their 
NFL-record sixth ring at the 
expense of the Arizona Cardi
nals first Super Bowl appear
ance.
The Steelers played 
through a tough schedule in 
the regular season to gain the 
number-two seed in the AFC 
playoffs. After winning two 
Consecutive playoff games at 
home at Heinz Field against 
the San Diego Chargers and 
division-rival Baltimore Ra
vens, the Steelers earned 
their seventh trip to the Super 
Bowl.
Sundays opponent, the 
Arizona Cardinals, has en
dured two changes in scenery 
as they moved from Chicago 
to St. Louis to Arizona. Upon 
arriving in the West in 1988, 
the Cardinals enjoyed only 
two winning seasons in the 
desert of Glendale, Ariz.
Representing the weak 
NFC West division, the Car
dinals amassed three playoff 
victories, including a road vic
tory against the Carolina Pan
thers that came between two 
playoff home victories against 
the Atlanta Falcons and the 
Philadelphia Eagles.
Amid the countless flashes 
and frenzied fanfare, the Car
dinals won the coin toss and 
deferred the first possession
to the Steelers. The Steelers 
went to work right away as 
they scored on their first two 
possessions to go up 10-0, 
kicker Jeff Reed and running 
back Gary Russell scoring a 
field goal and a touchdown, 
respectively.
The Cardinals answered 
right away with a touchdown 
of their own when Kurt War
ner threw his first touchdown 
pass to his tight end Ben Pat
rick from the 1-yard line.
The turning point in the 
game occurred during the 
final play of the first half. 
The Cardinals had the per
fect opportunity to equalize 
the score, as they drove all 
the way to the 1-yard line. 
However, Steelers linebacker, 
James Harrison, NFL Defen
sive Player of Year, stepped in 
front of wide receiver Anquan 
Boldin to intercept Warners 
pass on the goal line. With no 
time left on the clock, Har
rison returned the ball 100 
yards to extend the Pittsburgh 
lead to 17-7.
After halftime, the Steelers 
stifled the Cardinals offense 
yet again as Arizona gave up 
the ball to the Steelers. With 
a combination of short pass 
and running plays, the Steel
ers were able to take eight 
and a half minutes off the 
third-quarter clock to come 
away with only a field goal by 
Reed.
Two scoreless drives en
sued; the Cardinals regained 
possession of the football, and
the Cardinals offense took 
advantage of this opportunity. 
With a quick series of no-hud
dle plays, the Cardinals were 
able to get a quick touchdown 
as Warner completed eight 
consecutive passes, including 
a touchdown jump-pass to 
standout wide receiver Larry 
Fitzgerald in the back corner 
of the end zone to decrease 
the deficit to 20-14.
Another two scoreless 
drives occurred, and the 
Steelers were pinned inside 
the 1-yard line. Quarterback 
Ben Roethlisberger was able 
to execute a brilliant pass to 
wide receiver Santonio Hol
mes, but the play turned into 
a safety as a Steelers lineman 
was called for holding in the 
end zone.
The Cardinals answered 
immediately after the free 
kick as Arizonas Warner and 
Fitzgerald connected for a 
quick 64-yard pass to take 
their first lead of the game at 
23-20. In the next possession, 
the Steelers completed the 
comeback as Roethlisberger 
led the Steelers offense 78 
yards to take the final lead of 
the game.
The drive was highlighted 
by an athletic and acrobatic 
catch by Holmes on the side 
of the end zone. He was able 
to keep both feet in bounds as 
he helped his team win their 
sixth ring as a franchise. The 
27-23 final score sent Steelers 
fans rioting throughout the 
Pittsburgh streets.

SEPT. 15, 2008
School spirit may be in for 
a transformation, all at the 
hands of one small Scottie 
dog.
Last Tuesday, Skibo Gym
nasium was filled with stu
dents acting like dogs. The 
students were auditioning to 
play Scotty, Carnegie Mellons 
official mascot, and wear the 
official mascot costume.
The students were asked to 
prepare a two-minute skit that 
featured the talents and abili
ties of Scotty with the hopes 
of representing the mascot 
in costume at upcoming uni
versity events. The auditions 
followed a busy week for the 
Scottie dog, in which she was 
honored by the Pittsburgh 
Scottie Club and met with the 
Carnegie Mellon Highland 
Ambassadors, who will be 
walking her and bringing her 
to events.
Many students hope that 
the mascot will bring a re
newed sense of spirit to cam
pus.
I think we have a lot of 
school pride, but not neces
sarily school spirit. For ex
ample, we dont have good at
tendance at football games, 
said Lauren Gumbel, a sopho
more cognitive psychology 
major and member of the var
sity swim team. Now that we 
have an actual mascot, I think 
that might really help.
Allison Lukascy, a fifthyear architecture major, rec
ognized the impact of the 
mascot while noting the past 
change in campus spirit.
School spirit has grown 
exponentially in the past four 
years, Lukascy said. When 
I was a freshman, I had the 
impression that upperclass
men couldnt wait to graduate 
and leave the university. You 
would be hard-pressed to find
more than a handful of sup
porters at the weekend foot
ball games.
Lukascy contended that 
athletic attendance is just one 
of the things that have really 
improved.
Alauna Peterson, coach of 
the varsity cheerleading team 
and supervisor to the mascot 
performer, believes that spirit 
is once again on the rise. Pe
terson was in charge of Tues
days auditions.
I can tell you some no
table moments of the tryout, 
Peterson said. [There were] 
judges doing the *wave on 
command from a Scotty per
spective, a Scottish jig set to 
contemporary music, and 
seemingly nice-looking props 
that were crushed upon force
ful impact during a routine.
Peterson said that students 
were encouraged to bring 
props, music, and signs.
According to Peterson, the 
mascot performer has been 
selected. However, due to 
the anonymous position, no 
information can be released 
about the students chosen or 
numbers at tryouts.
The mascot performer will 
appear at the Business Oppor
tunities Conference Wednes
day, as well as home football 
games and homecoming 
events.
Im excited to see what 
the first home football game 
will be like with our new mas
cot, the cheer team, and band 
getting the crowd going and 
look forward to a large turn
out and participation among 
the student body, Peterson 
said.
On Friday, Scotty herself 
was honored by the Pitts
burgh Scottie Club and given 
a welcome basket.
The welcome took place 
in Tang Au Lab in Porter Hall, 
near the office of Larry Cart
wright, professor of civil and 
environmental engineering 
and owner of Scotty. At Cart
wrights home, Scotty is af
fectionately known as Maggie 
and lives with her two Scottie 
brothers, Chase and Murray.
The Carnegie Mellon High
land Ambassadors were pres
ent at the welcome ceremony, 
where they met Scotty for the 
first time.
The Highland Ambassa
dors interact with alumni and 
top university personnel such 
as the Board of Trustees, the 
Alumni Association Board, 
and VIP visitors to campus. 
They will soon take on the 
job of walking Scotty and ac
companying her to university 
events.
Some students find spirit 
still lacking, however.
If you look at the Kiltie 
Band alone, youd say we have 
amazing spirit, said David 
Kinskey-Lebeda, a sophomore 
civil engineering major and 
member of the Kiltie Band. 
I, however, dont think the 
school as a whole has much 
school spirit, but then again, 
athletic events, for example, 
arent exactly publicized 
much. Ive never been encour
aged to go to a game by some
one.
However, the mascot is 
not the only effort to increase 
spirit on campus. Homecom
ing celebrations in late Octo
ber of this year will include 
more events for alumni and 
a home football game, some
thing that happened last year 
but was lacking in 2006.
Im proud to coach the 
cheer team at Carnegie Mel
lon and I know my athletes 
and all the athletic teams, 
coaches, and administration 
have got the spirit  Id love 
to see even more of it reflected 
in the campus community at 
large, Peterson said.

Albom asks readers to have faith
Second nonfiction novel tells story of priest, rabbi
Everything you need to know 
About moving in and moving on
Eulogizing someone you are close to is hard, but 
whats even harder is being asked to talk about 
someone you dont know at all. That is why when 
famous author and sportswriter Mitch Albom was 
requested by his 82-year-old rabbi, Albert Lewis, to 
write his eulogy, Albom was dumbfounded. Caught 
in a quandary, Albom decided to meet with Lewis, 
or as Albom fondly calls him! "the Reb, to get to 
know him better. While Albom wasnt aware of it 
then, agreeing to eulogize his rabbi would lead him 
down a path that would result in him publishing his 
second nonfiction novel, Have A Little Faith, and 
help him to discover his own faith in the process.

Mitch Albom's newest book Have A Little Faith is 
the eulogy of his 82-year-old rabbi.
Albom catapulted to fame with the release of his first 
nonfiction novel, Tuesdays with Morrie, which was 
converted into a popular TV film by Oprah Winfrey. 
Since then, Albom has been active in the sports and 
literary fields by continuing his radio talk shows and 
writing more books like The Five People You Meet in 
Heaven and For One More Day.
Last Tuesday, Albom made an appearance at the 
Byham Theater, and the residents of Pittsburgh 
got a chance to listen to him talk about his latest 
release. As witty and engrossing as his writing, 
Albom captivated the audience with nuances about 
how the events leading up to the writing of the 
book unfolded, and the thought process behind its 
creation.
The book follows the story of two religious figures:
A rabbi and a priest, Lewis and Henry Covington, 
emerge from completely different backgrounds and 
separate religions, but unite in their faith in God.
While Lewis story relates with what we usually 
expect from a man of faith, Covingtons succeeds 
in surprising us all. Growing up in a broken home, 
Covingtons childhood is fractured, and after his
- fathers death, he enters a life of crime. He passes 
his years trafficking drugs, serving time in jail, and 
being a part of local mobs, but what finally brings his 
downfall is his drug addiction. Crazed by the need 
to consume more drugs, Covington spends all his 
money and is reduced to stealing from his friends, 
and on one lonely night  afraid that his friends will 
return to make him pay for his actions  Covington 
begins to pray to God, pleading that he will forever 
serve God if he is spared today.
Years later, Covington is now a transformed person: 
a pastor in Detroit, Mich., Alboms hometown.
He looks after a crumbling church that serves as 
a shelter for homeless people, but can hardly be 
considered a shelter because of a large hole in the 
ceiling that lets in all the elements, making the 
freezing winters of Detroit especially difficult.
Albom, who has opened three of his own charities 
to aid the impoverished in Detroit, is interested in 
helping the homeless, and in his attempt to do so, 
crosses paths with Covington and befriends him.
During his talk, Albom mentioned the kind of 
person he was before he grew to know Lewis and 
Covington  detached from religion, and happy to 
be that way. But by meeting these two remarkable 
individuals, Albom got a chance to speak with them 
about why they believe and what keeps their faith 
going: questions that are universal.
By describing how two men discovered and-keep 
their faith, Have A Little Faith attempts to spread 
the word about how believing in a higher being can 
make people's lives seem so much less lonely and 
helpless than believing in nothing at all.

Dear Rohit,
I am thinking about moving 
in with my girlfriend 
next semester when my 
apartment lease runs out, 
but some of my friends 
dont think its a good idea. 
What do you think?
Moving In Or Out
Dear Moving,
Were lucky that we can 
even consider the option 
of cohabitation  a couple 
generations ago it would 
have been scandalous even 
to think of it. Even so, just 
because coed housing is 
mostly accepted nowadays, it 
doesnt mean living with your 
partner is necessarily a good 
idea. Living with someone you 
love can be like a fabulous 
dream, but make sure youre 
doing it for the right reasons. 
Moving in with somebody to 
save money, to piss off your 
parents, or to test him or 
her out before marriage are 
all important considerations 
but are definitely not good 
reasons to do so.
Do remember, its difficult 
enough to break up with 
someone, but its even worse 
when you have to pack up 
boxes and break leases on 
top of the heartache. I am 
guessing this is the concern 
voiced by your friends. But, 
hey, love is all about risks, 
right? Just make sure youve 
thought about all the pros 
and cons and are ready to 
deal with them before signing 
that lease.
Enjoy your stay,
Rohit
Dear Rohit,
Help! My ex-girifriend 
lives just down the hall 
from me, and though 
were still good friends,
I have a big problem. I 
brought someone else 
home the other night and 
it was incredibly awkward.
I dont want to make my 
ex-girlfriend feel bad, but 
I need to move on!
Seeking To Attract Girls
Dear STAG,
Thats " an unfortunate 
situation. However, its 
really good that you and 
your ex have managed to 
remain friends  thats an 
accomplishment in and 
of itself. If youre sure that 
there's nothing between the 
two of you anymore (and you 
should really try to figure that 
out), then theres no reason 
you shouldnt go on living 
your life. That doesnt mean 
rubbing it in her face, though.
Especially if its a one-nightonly type of situation, theres 
no reason you cant stay in 
your room instead of hanging 
out in common areas. And, 
as always, turn on a stereo 
as a precaution. Trust me: 
The walls are always thinner 
than you think they are.
Have fun,
Rohit

Tales from abroad: Europe
Studying in London, visiting Ireland, and traveling on a train through Germany and Austria
In high school I was lucky enough to spend a summer 
in Bath, England while my dad was working there. I 
knew I wanted to go back to England someday, and that 
ended up being sooner rather than later when I decided 
to study abroad. I was lucky enough to find a school, 
London Metropolitan University, which had the classes 
that I needed to take for my biology major and art minor. 
Throughout my semester in London, I kept a blog so 
that I could easily share my adventures with family and 
friends back home. Every couple of weeks, I would write 
up a long entry describing my experiences. The following 
are highlights from my blog posts.
Jan. 28, 2009
As I drove to the airport it finally hit me: I was going to 
London... alone. Later, when I looked out my window as 
we were landing and saw the English countryside, I got 
a surge in my chest that was a mix of excitement and 
apprehension when I realized that I was really going to 
live here!
I spent the first few days settling into my dorm room, 
as well as exploring the neighborhoods around Kings 
Cross, touring Piccadilly Circus, and investigating my 
new campus.
Feb. 3, 2009
On Saturday, I went to St. Pauls Cathedral with other 
students in my program. My friends in other programs 
were jealous that ours had so much planned out for us. 
We saw where St. Pauls was hit in the blitz, and I was 
absolutely in love with the wood carvings and glittering
In that first month, we checked.out the famed Oxford 
Street for some shopping, watched the Steelers win 
the Super Bowl in an American student bar, and found 
out that our first day of classes was canceled because 
London had had the worst snow in 18 years the night 
before.
Feb. 10, 2009
I remember seeing Windsor Castle as I was flying 
in - its hard to miss! It's the largest inhabited castle 
in the world. The main rooms were absolutely gorgeous
with amazing gold tapestries, paintings, furniture, and 
clocks everywhere. There were enormous armory rooms 
with huge displays of guns and swords to show how well 
the Crown is protected.
Feb. 24, 2009
One of my favorite sites was the Tower of London  its 
always cool to see the Beefeaters, medieval graffiti, and 
the original chopping block used for executions. We 
continued our big tourist day by visiting Big Ben and 
Westminster Abbey.
Apr. 20, 2009
It was tough to adjust to a new Blackboard-like website 
and class structure, and figuring out when my final 
exams were was the final challenge. In the UK they call 
studying "revising," and the last day of classes and finals 
are often far apart.
My program took weekend trips to Edinburgh, Oxford, 
and Stratford. Highlights of the trip were the great 
English accents, seeing Edinburgh Castle, trying haggis
 a dish made of sheeps heart, liver, and lungs and 
usually boiled in the animals stomach for three hours, 
and plenty of Harry Potter, Shakespeare, Tolkien, and 
C.S. Lewis landmarks pointed out to us by our tour 
guides.
A few friends and I planned our own Ireland trip. We saw 
the beautiful cliffs of Moher and subjected the Irish to 
dealing with crazy Americans getting lost driving on the 
other side of the road with a stick shift.
Apr. 26, 2009
For spring break, I took a trip around Europe on the 
Eurail with two friends, one of whom had won three 
passes through a Facebook contest. We went to too 
many great cities to describe them all. We first landed in 
Hamburg, which was having the largest fair in Northern 
Germany, and we had fun checking out the rides and 
eating bratwurst. Prague was one of my favorites with 
beautiful old landmarks like the Old Town Square, Old 
Jewish Cemetery, and the Charles Bridge.
We continued on to Krakow to see the World War II
concentration camps: Auschwitz and Buchenwald
 an unlikely choice for a fun spring break trip, but we 
thought it was something we needed to see. When the 
tour guide stated how many people died in Auschwitz,
I uncontrollably got the chills and felt the gravity of the 
fact that this happened here.
Next, we traveled to Vienna for a day. We learned a lot 
about train travel, including how you should always 
designate a private sleeping car and shower when 
you have the option. Also, we were awoken when the 
train crossed the border into Austria by knocking and 
"Austrian police! Passports! When the border police 
officer saw our passports, he exclaimed, "California! 
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good president of 
California!
Venice is a great city for just walking around and getting 
lost. I was lucky enough to go to the San Marco Basilic^ 
for Easter mass  all in Italian, of course. We took a train 
to Dsseldorf but got to the wrong airport. We had no 
idea that there were two airports in Dsseldorf, so we 
took an expensive, long cab ride to the right airport and, 
thankfully, made it in time for our flight. At least things 
had gone relatively smoothly until the end.
It was sad that this experience had to end and I had to 
part from the amazing people I met along my journey, 
but I know that leaving London and my friends won't be 
goodbye forever.

Indie live at Ches-a-rena Paperhouse
Silversun Pickups, Cage the Elephant, and An Horse 0n braindancing
Last Saturday, at the Ches-a-rena venue in 
Cheswick, the Silversun Pickups and their opening 
acts collaborated to form the perfect shoegaze 
lineup, characterized by distorted guitar effects and 
creative synths. The band just kicked off their 2009 
fall tour to celebrate the release of their new album, 
Swoon.
J.W. Ramp | Publisher
Joe Lesser on keys for the Silversun Pickups at 
Ches-a-rena last Saturday.
There was a constant flow of energy throughout the 
evening. Each act, though they were all extremely 
different, added something to the experience that 
made for beautiful symbiotic performances. It 
seemed as if there was no part of the evening that 
would disappoint.
Though a little ways out of Pittsburgh, Ches-a-rena, 
an indoor roller-skating rink turned evening concert 
venue hidden above the local Goodwill, was the 
perfect venue to house this eccentric show. The hall 
was quickly filled with a diverse group of fans. From 
60-year-old all-female biker gangs to nine-year-old 
first time concert-goer Megan Cooper  the show 
certainly attracted a peculiar crowd. Although 
extremely quirky, the crowds energy proved endless.
An Horse, who had previously opened for Tegan 
and Sara on their 2008 tour and Death Cab for 
Cutie on their Australian tour, provided a perfect 
beginning. With their catchy melodies and skilled 
harmonies, band members and Aussies Kate Cooperand Damon Cox showed audiences how to make 
two instruments sound like one beautiful indie rock 
symphony. The group played songs off their newest 
album, Rearrange Beds, and previewed some tunes 
from the upcoming EP.
Things got a little crazy when Cage the Elephant, 
coming all the way from Bowling Green, Ky. hit the 
stage. Front man and lead singer Matt Shultz worked 
the stage with his vicious vocals and crowd dives.
During Ain't No Rest for the Wicked," Shultz got 
lost while crowd surfing in a sea of fans. The bands 
set consisted of angry, hyped-up versions of some 
hits from their 2008 release Cage the Elephant, as 
well as some new tracks from their upcoming album.
By the time the Silversun Pickups had made it on 
' stage, the crowd was bursting with anticipation and 
enthusiasm. Lead singer and guitarist Brian Aubert, 
bassist Nikki Monninger, drummer Christopher 
Guanlao, and keyboardist Joe Lesser began the 
show with a roar of synth and distortion that quickly 
became a regular trend between songs. The group 
played a variety of tracks from their new album, but 
also made sure to include some billboard favorites 
from their previous album, Carnavas, like "Little 
Lovers So Polite and Lazy Eye.
Because the show itself was on the smaller side, 
the band was able to form a relationship with the 
crowd. In between songs and charismatic banter 
from Aubert and Monninger, the group even took 
questions from the crowd. The personal atmosphere 
only added to the experience, making it impossible 
not to adore the set.
By popular demand, the group ended the show with 
 three-song encore including the crowd favorite 
Substitution from Swoon.

Brian Aubert kept audiences enthralled with his 
witty humor between songs.
So, youre in your dorm and you hear some God-awful techno 
blasting down the hall. Youre not doing too much, just trying 
to get a glimpse of the line that determines the limits of your 
reality and coming to the realization that you are the dreamer 
dreaming up the dream that is your life. You know, simple 
stuff, really. But, despite how mundane those thoughts might 
be, you just cant concentrate because the atrociously bland 
music is numbing each and every neuron in your body. The 
good, peaceful numbing: the abysmal complacent numbness 
that you get from staring at the television for three hours.
Well, my friends, that techno that youre hearing is the tip of an 
incredible iceberg. Unbeknownst to you, this repulsively bland 
entity is nothing more than a mislabeled genre. Electronic 
music is better described as a means of instrumentation. 
Its not a new age development, but an example of what 
happens when humans find new media for creation. Its history 
as an established aesthetic begins when Ferruccio Busoni 
published Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music. Quite a piece of 
work. Nevertheless, I havent explained what youll find when 
you swim off the shore of traditional music: simply that youve 
overlooked a beautiful and cryptic expanse of sounds.
So, youre wondering what you should check out to see 
the vast gamut of sonic tapestries that exist in the realm of 
electronic music, arent you? Well, for starters, listen to Aphex 
Twin, which is, in my opinion, an incredibly effective primer 
in learning how to brain dance. Aphex Twins discography 
contains a range of acid (90s jungle), synesthetic ambient, 
drum and bass, classical, songs about milkmen, noise, 
spectrographic analysis, and rich, intricate rhythms at all 
sorts of tempos.
The big thing that electronic music did for me was that it taught 
me how to know what I liked hearing. Abrasive, minimal, 
ethereal, ghostly, uplifting, soul-crushing, body rockin, mind 
soothing; believe you me, my friend, someone has recorded 
it and its waiting for you to experience it.
No more Sandstorm. Ever.

Placing the drum in the spotlight
Afrika Yetu and August Wilson Center collaborate to produce a series of drumming events
The drum is an instrument that is not often given center 
stage. Lacking the melody of a piano, the soulfulness 
of an acoustic guitar, and the sharp tones of a trumpet, 
the beats of a drum may be understated but are hardly 
inessential to music. Other instruments may provide 
melody and harmony, but it is the drum that provides 
rhythm to song.
From Oct. 15 through 18, the August Wilson Center for 
African American Culture and Afrika Yetu, organizations 
that promote African culture, hosted Drum Talk, a 
four-day event that put the drum in the spotlight. The 
concert aimed at depicting how the drum is universal; 
every country has its own variation of this percussion' 
instrument. Just like the drums, the line-up of excellent 
drummers were from all over the world, and drumming 
styles from Japan, Brazil, Africa, the Middle East, and, of 
course, America were on display.
The series of drumming concerts ended on Sunday,
Oct. 18, in a finale show that featured legendary jazz 
drummer Roger Humphries, multi-platinum band Rusted 
Roots drummer Jim Donovan, Japans Takumi Kato, 
and Congolese drummer and founder of Afrika Yetu, Elie 
Kihonia.
Kato was, without a doubt, the most impressive among 
all the performers, drawing gasps and loud applause 
from the audience during his act. He beat on four large 
Japanese drums  one of them was so large it was 
propped up on a stand  with extra-thick drumsticks, 
and displayed an unbelievable amount of strength and 
energy as he played the drums at a lightning-fast speed 
and even jumped in the air several times during his 
performance. Kato beat the drums so hard and fast that 
his hands were a blur  he even broke a drumstick with 
his force, causing him to stop and look in the audience 
for the broken piece apologetically. His stage presence 
was very charismatic because, although the audience
Courtesy of Renee Rosensteel
was in awe of him, he interacted with the audience 
members easily by cracking minor jokes about how tired 
he was.
Humphries, a Pittsburgh native and famous jazz 
percussionist  Feb. 23 has been declared by the 
state of Pennsylvania and the city of Pittsburgh to be 
Roger Humphries Day  opened the show with his jazz 
band. His drumming blended well with the sounds of 
the trumpet and saxophone, but what stood out was 
Humphries exceptional drum solos in which he went all 
out, playing complex and foot-tapping rhythms.
Donovan, the last performer, was joined by other 
drummers, two guitarists, a keyboardist, and Kihonia. Up 
until this point in the performance, the drums had either 
been played with accompaniment, like Humphries, or 
solo, like Kato, but not all together, so when Donovan and 
his team began to play their drums, they created a sound 
like nothing else. While it might seem that many drums 
beating together would produce chaos rather than 
music, Donovan was able to produce a steady, powerful, 
and rhythmic beat that made the audience want to 
stand up and dance.
Apart from his experience in his band, Rusted Root, 
Donovan has studied many different African styles of 
drumming and incorporates this into his sound. Thus, he 
plays a unique mixture of beats that is a pleasure to hear.
While Kato was the most impressive, Kihonia was 
definitely the life of the performance. Although Kihonia 
didn't perform alone  he played with Humphries and 
Donovan  his playing and singing clearly stood out. 
Dressed in beautiful, traditional African attire with a 
smile to match, he insisted that the audience have a 
good time during the performance by encouraging them 
to dance along to the beats. He also demonstrated a few 
dance moves that the audience sportingly mimicked.
Left: Different drummers peform together, creat
ing a remarkably synchronized sound.
Right: Takumi Kato's album promises to be as 
great as his performance.
Kihonia stressed the importance of fun in everyones 
lives. If youre angry, you dont deserve to live!" he said, 
emphasizing that parents should let their children enjoy 
themselves and actually join in on the fun.
Before being the head of the non-profit organization, 
Kihonia is first a Congolese master drummer and is 
skilled in various instruments including the xylophone, 
mbira, guitar, keyboard, accordion, and, of course, hand 
and set drums. Kihonia has a passion for spreading 
African culture, and this passion was plainly seen when 
he requested each of the audience members grab one of 
the many drums placed at either end of the auditorium 
and try a hand at drumming.
Toward the end of the performance, Donovan, Kihonia, 
and the rest of the drummers were joined on stage by 
Kato and African drummers from the previous days 
performances. It was obvious that none of this drumming 
had been previously rehearsed and it was amazing to 
see how so many experienced and talented drummers 
could all play together in harmony.
Kihonia conducted a little exercise in which the 
audience members tried to repeat a rhythm on their own 
drum that one of the professional drummers played. This 
was fun because, although the audience was clearly 
not in the same league as the professionals, they were 
encouraged to practice a few beats and interact with the 
performers on stage.
Drum Talk is an annual event run by Afrika Yetu and has 
been presented in collaboration with the August Wilson 
Center this year. Find out more at www.afrikayetu.org

True love brought to life by magic of ballet
Pittsburgh Ballet Theaters great performance of Sleeping Beauty is anything but a snore
From Oct. 16 to 18, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) 
presented a production of The Sleeping Beauty, a ballet 
composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky and choreographed 
by Marius Petipa. The cast for the show changed each 
night; this review details the performances from opening 
night on Oct. 16.
The ballet, which originally premiered at the Maryinsky 
Ballet in St. Petersburg, tells the story of a princess, 
Aurora, who is cursed by an evil witch and who, when 
pricked by the spindle of a spinning wheel, falls into a 
deep sleep and can only be woken by her true loves kiss.
The PBT production featured glittering costumes, 
a (silent) cackling witch, and a set that masterfully 
switched between palatial balls and the deep woods.
At one point in the third act, during the celebration 
of the wedding of Princess Aurora (Kumiko Tsuji) and 
Prince Desire (Christopher Budzynski), the creativity 
of the costume designers and the dancers really came 
through. In the bluebird dance, Alexandra Kochis and 
Alexandre Silva performed steps that mirrored the 
actions of birds, keeping their moves light and fluttering. 
Their costumes contained texturing that looked like 
feathers as well.

Christine Schwaner dances gracefully as the Bluebird.
In the cat dance, Puss in Boots (Nicholas Coppula) 
and the White Cat (Alison Kappes) humorously played 
with each other on stage, dancing and occasionally 
slapping each others ears. The scene evoked laughter 
from the audience, who seemed to appreciate the 
characterization of the cats.
The wicked fairy that cursed Aurora, Carabosse (Julia 
Erickson), was especially good in this performance.
Erickson channels her inner witch on stage, and without 
ever making a sound, she is able to make the audience 
hear her cackling.
Tsuji as Aurora was very impressive. At several points, 
her ability to maintain balance on one foot with 
seemingly no effort evoked applause in the middle of 
a scene. The Lilac Fairy (Christine Schwaner) was an 
integral part of the ballet. It is because of her that Aurora 
sleeps rather than dies due to Carabosse's curse, and 
she appears to keep the story moving in every act. She is 
also featured in several dance numbers throughout the 
show, and in each, her skill is showcased perfectly.
Throughout the show, each move was executed 
flawlessly  or, at least, if there was a flaw, it was 
certainly not visible or noticeable to the audience, 
and the dancers hid it well. The music matched each 
movement and added depth and emotion to every 
dance.

Three distinct pieces of music create grand evening
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra features Composing with Words at Heinz Hall
Entering the cacophonous hall during tuning and 
loosening of fingers and lungs, one is struck by the 
activity and excitement on stage. The audience looks 
distinguished; that is to say, there was a lot of gray 
hair. So began the night at Heinz Hall, featuring the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert entitled 
Composing with Words.
Three distinct pieces were performed: Peter Mennins 
Concertato for Orchestra, Moby Dick, started the 
evening; following was the world premiere of A Woman's 
Life. After intermission, the orchestra returned for a full 
symphony  Sibelius No. 2.
Smartly dressed in elegant black, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, with nimble fingers especially 
flying on fortissimo sections, certainly lived up to its 
world class status. Conductor Leonard Slatkin spent the 
night in his element, nearly dancing in the fluidity of 
his movements, adding an occasional hop (one can only 
assume unconsciously) for emphasis as he directed the 
orchestra.
The single movement Moby Dick, inspired by Melvilles 
novel of the same name, begins simply but quickly 
progresses to an up-tempo, rhythmically-charged,
powerful, yet harmonious level from which it rarely 
leaves. Featuring handoffs between melody-developing 
winds and melody-sustaining strings, this dynamic 
piece serves as a very well-thought opener that engages 
and energizes the audience and demonstrates the power 
of sound.
A Woman's Life was born of a collaboration between 
Richard Danielpour, a Grammy Award-winning 
American composer, and poet Maya Angelou.
Danielpour wrote it especially for dramatic soprano 
Angela Brown. Created to reflect the trajectory of a 
womans life, Angelous selected poem titles include 
Little Girl Speakings, Life Doesnt Frighten Me, 
Come and Be My Baby, and others.
Starting with a childhood of innocence and whimsical 
carefree adulation for parents ("Little Girl Speakings), 
expressed both musically and lyrically (Aint nobody 
better than Daddy..."), the composition progresses 
through the insecurity of teenage years to the especially 
self-confident and evocatively sophisticated sexually 
charged Come and Be My Baby.
It warrants mention that soprano Brown could have 
better served this section by utilizing a more jazzy
approach to her singing. A melancholy tone sets in with 
My Life Has Turned to Blue, aptly reflected in the 
-music.
The up-tempo parts meshed with the upbeat lyrics 
in some sections, but the more melancholy verses 
didnt always fit the music, observed Tracy Clough, a 
Columbia University English graduate student.
Returning from intermission, the orchestra performed 
Jean SibeMus' Symphony No. 2 in D major, Opus 43. The 
Finnish composers symphony was finished in 1902 and 
consists of four movements: Allegretto, Andante ma 
rubato, Vivacissimo, and Finale: Allegro moderate.
Initially the melodic sections sound disjointed, as shifts 
of melodic continuity are short-lived. This is a hallmark 
of Sibelius compositional style.
The ending was a tease of continual climaxes 
that dissipated and built again ever higher until 
finally achieving restrained grandeur of musical 
accomplishment.

To eat or not to eat?
Seafood Watch explains how your choice of dinner may be influencing our environment
At some point during high school, I swore off eating 
shark fin and all its manifestations. It was not solely an 
environmentally friendly decision  sharks are brutally 
killed for the primary purpose of obtaining its fin  but 
with the abundance of fake shark fin in the market, why 
be irresponsible when it comes to health?
The numerous available sustainable seafood advisory 
lists make it easier for consumers to be responsible. 
One of the most well-known guides, Monterey Bay 
Aquariums Seafood Watch, is a program that aims to 
raise awareness among seafood eaters to enjoy seafood 
sustainably and responsibly.
On its website, Seafood Watch states that its members 
believe that seafood from sources, either fished or 
farmed, that can exist over the long-term without 
compromising species survival or the health of the 
surrounding ecosystem is sustainable. Apart from this 
strong aim, the most attractive part of Seafood Watch is 
that it is user-friendly.
Seafood Watch updates its list from time to time, and 
the guide can be downloaded from the Monterey Bay 
Aquarium website, www.jnontereybayaquarium.org. But 
what really makes Seafood Watch highly accessible is its 
iPhone/iPod touch application. Electronically updating 
the list has never been easier.
The list is sorted by region for easier navigation.
Once youve chosen a region, you can view the list 
alphabetically. Each fish is rated according to a color 
scheme as Best Choice, Good Alternative, or Avoid. Each 
list also gives some explanation about the market name, 
health alert, and summary of why that particular fish is 
rated Best Choice or Avoid.
In seafood bars or supermarkets, it seems logical that 
farmed salmon would be a better choice environmentally 
than wild salmon, since farming does not disturb the 
natural habitat of wild salmon in streams. In actuality, 
consuming wild salmon is significantly better for the 
environment. The salmon farming industry extremely 
pollutes the environment, and the methods of fishing 
wild salmon are so well-managed that they are more 
sustainable. For all these reasons, eating wild salmon is 
actually better for the environment.
Its not only concern for the environment; industrially 
grown animals are unhealthy to eat. Fundamentally, 
when anything  fish, vegetable, or chicken  is 
produced on a large scale, the producer will put them in 
an artificial environment for more efficient production.
For vegetables, these man-made modifications come 
in the form of pesticides, while farm-raised salmon are 
loaded with antibiotics. Essentially, antibiotics prevent 
or slow down the growth of bacteria, beneficial or not. If 
we are so strict about taking just the precise amount of

Seafood markets offer a variety of fish for the consumer, but it is important to know which of these species of
fish are healthy for both the consumer and the environment.
prescribed human antibiotics, why should we consume 
the animal version uncontrollably?
Theres a need for consumers to start thinking about 
whats on their plate and where it comes from. Its about 
understanding food from start to finish  the entire "life 
cycle.
One of the most famous fish featured in discussions 
about green seafood is blue fin tuna. Blue fin tuna, the 
filet mignon of all the fish in the ocean, is highly priced 
by all sushi restaur ants. At the Nobu restaurant chain, 
owned by Nobu Matsuhisa, customers can find blue fin 
tuna on the menu, and, lately, the restaurant and owner 
have been under attack for serving this endangered 
species of fish. Being a high profile restaurant, food 
conscious people are looking for Nobu to set the 
right example by sending a responsible message to 
consumers. Celebrity clients, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, 
have publicly sworn off Nobu until the restaurants 
position on including blue fin tuna on their menu has 
changed.
With the spotlight on blue fin tuna, we often forget that 
this endangered tag is not a permanent one. Hold on 
to your appetite and find a good substitute on Seafood 
Watch. With lower consumption, these species will be 
available again, and this is precisely the reason that 
Seafood Watch and other lists are constantly updated. 
Fish are taken on and off the list depending on whether 
consumers want more or less of them and how the 
industry treats the species.

Zombies rise from Pittsburgh
The commercial fame of these decaying monsters dates back to George Romeros movie

Pittsburgh has been home to a lot of scary things; 
see, for example, the haunted Dormonth library or the 
Pittsburgh Pirates season records. But, with all of the 
haunted houses and ghost stories in this city, many 
fail to realize the incredible impact that Pittsburgh has 
had on the Hollywood horror industry. In fact, because 
of its history, many would be surprised to know that 
Pittsburgh is commonly referred to as the home of the 
modern American zombie.
The concept of the living dead has been present in 
global culture for centuries now. In communities all over 
the world, folklore and legends consistently mention 
the resurrection of the dead. These cultural concepts 
birthed a modern-day notion, an infectious and highly 
contagious virus that wakes the dead and allows them to 
walk among the living as "zombies.
Before these flesh-hungry, angry beings made their 
literary debut in Ambrose Bierces The Death ofHalpin 
Fiaysei, the concept of the living dead had .subtly 
appeared in many earlier publications. Mary Shelleys 
Frankenstein, for example, is a story of resurrected life 
that can be traced back to early 1700s European folklore. 
Even before this, religious stories collected in the Middle 
Eastern classic One Thousand and One Nights reference 
ghouls and the undead within their text. By the 19th 
century, zombies had successfully crept their way into 
the gothic poems of Edgar Allan Poe and the plots and 
storylines of countless supernatural novelists.
Predictably enough, it didnt take long for the zombies to 
invade popular culture. Zombies were soon featured in 
movies and television programs all over the world.
Romero, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, quickly became 
known as the father of the Zombie Apocalypse" and, 
conveniently enough, he based his zombie empire 
right here in Pittsburgh. Not only were a majority of 
his movies filmed here, but his production company,
The Latent Image, and industrial film firm, Hardman 
Associates, worked out of Pittsburgh as well.
Because of its incredible popularity, Night of the Living 
Dead spawned countless imitations, and Romeros work 
became the source from which most modern zombie 
elements were borrowed.
As time progressed; Romeros zombies evolved. No 
longer would they just be flocks of decomposing, 
flesh-hungry people. In his next films, Day of the Dead 
and Land of the Dead, also filmed here in Pittsburgh, 
Romero's zombies appeared capable of learning and 
adopting methods of communication. Soon, zombie 
culture would make its way into comedy (Shaun of the 
Dead) and children's media (in Disneys Fido, the main 
character keeps a zombie as a tame and friendly pet).
Thanks to Romero and his band of corpse-loving creeps, 
Pittsburgh will forever be the birthplace of the modern 
zombie. So, this Halloween, instead of wrapping yourself 
in gauze like a mummy or poking holes in your bed 
sheets to dress as a ghost, maybe try to show some 
Pittsburgh pride and don a face of the living dead.
Meela Dudley | Assitant Pillbox Editor
It was George Romeros 1968 independent black-andwhite release of Night of the Living Dead, though, 
which truly revolutionized the modern zombie. Romeros 
film was subversive and ground-breaking. In the film, 
the protagonists, played by Duane Jones and Judith 
ODea, find themselves trapped in a rural Pennsylvanian 
farmhouse attempting to survive a night through a 
sudden zombie conquest. It was a concept unlike any 
seen before it: The dead could actually come alive and 
eat us all.

Create crazy costumes with what you own
Be a glittering butterfly or the suave Jack Sparrow: tips on dressing to impress this Halloween
r by Prema Agarwal | Junior Staffwriter J
It's that time of the year again when everyone dresses 
up in creative outfits to celebrate the lurking spirits of 
Halloween, and one of the biggest aspects of the holiday 
is choosing the right costume. So with the coming of 
the end of October, its time to get creative and crazy
 dress up as whoever or whatever you choose! Its not 
necessary to spend hundreds of dollars on an expensive 
outfit that you might never use again, and besides, who 
wants to have the same costume every year?
Its actually quite simple to whip up an outfit in a dorm 
room. Whether you want to be a very attractive geek
 lets be honest: We go to Carnegie Mellon, so that 
shouldn't be a very hard costume to assemble  or you 
want to be the charming Jack Sparrow, its easier than 
you think to put these costumes together. Below are 
guidelines to create some great sample outfits that can 
be assembled from the contents of your or your friends 
wardrobes  and later, follow some general tips that can 
make creating the perfect costume much easier.
Fpr 01e G2rls
T1e A00rar02ve Nerd:
Hey, who said a nerd cant be irresistible? To be the 
exception to the unattractive nerd rule, find a pair of 
glasses  the rounder the better. If you dont have a 
pair, borrow one, but it looks like Carnegie Mellon hasnt 
gotten to you  yet.
Get a pair of high-waist shorts (you can even make do 
with a regular pair of shorts or pants) and a fitted T-shirt, 
which must be tucked in. Also find some suspenders 
to go with your shorts. An alternative to wearing 
suspenders could be wearing your Carnegie Mellon 
ID around your neck. Tie your hair in two pigtails and 
we've officially found one of the most attractive nerds on 
campus.
A Pre00y Bu00erfly:
This costume is perfect: elegant, gorgeous, and easy to 
put together. All you need is your favorite little, black 
dress  any simple, yet stunning dress should do the 
trick  and once youve got that, the only thing left 
to do is prepare the wings. When it comes to creating 
the wings, the sky is the limit. Try and use whatever 
materials are available, like sequins, glitter, and multi
colored paper.
For example, try making the wings out of net by making 
the frame with a wire and then wrapping the net around 
the frame. Cardboard wings work well, too. Just cut 
them out of a sheet of cardboard and use some elastic 
or a piece of rope so that the wings can be fastened on
as a hippie is a great idea. Wear a tie-dyed T-shirt, a 
pair of sandals, a headband (use a bandanna or borrow a - 
headband from a girlfriend) and put on a pair of colored 
sunglasses. To add to the effect and value of the outfit, 
definitely carry anything that has fringes on it.
Qu2rk T2ps:
Dress loose and simple, and make sure you dress to 
impress! The key to preparing a personal and special inhouse outfit is simple:
1. Keep in mind what you need to prepare the outfit, and 
in times of confusion, ask your friends; everyone has 
crazy ideas.
2. Raid your closet and see what stuff fits the bill.
3. Borrow stuff from friends that might be necessary to 
substitute for what you dont have. Chances are that 
they also might need to borrow something from you. It 
is better to borrow than to splurge on an item that isnt 
going to be used again.
4. If you or your friends dont have an article that might 
be needed, remember that each article has many ways 
it can be substituted without losing the authenticity of 
the outfit.
Work with friends on your costumes, experiment, and go 
crazy!
your shoulders. Add finishing touches with sparkling eye 
shadow, bright lip gloss, and exaggerated eye makeup, 
and you're ready to fly.
Fpr 01e Bpys
Jark Sparrpw:
This Pirates of the Caribbean lead is definitely one of the 
most irresistible characters on the silver screen. To be 
Johnny Depps most popular alias, put on a white, loose 
shirt (or borrow it from a friend who is a size larger than 
you), find a vest, a pair of pants to match, a black belt, 
and a pair of boots. If you cant find a good pair of boots, 
try wearing long socks that match the color of the shoes 
over the pants first, and then wear the shoes.
Tie a bright-colored bandanna (any kind of small colored 
cloth should work) around your head. You can also get 
a wig  this will definitely add to the dramatic effect of 
your outfit. If you plan well in advance, attempt to grow a 
beard and mustache, but if that is not possible, then you 
can draw them on with some black eyeliner. Make an 
eye patch to be an exceptional pirate and you're ready to 
get your treasure tonight.

Make stir-fry, not jack-o-lanterns
Iconic Halloween vegetable cooked with fried egg creates delicious side dish
Halloween is all about tricks, and stir-fried pumpkin 
with egg is a tricky dish. Parents make this to trick their 
children into eating vegetables. Some mothers put this 
dish on the table to get their children over their fear of 
vegetables. But, no matter what it is used for, stir-fried 
pumpkin is a recipe that looks at the iconic Halloween 
vegetable in a non-sweet way.
Ingred2en0s:
A generous amount of minced garlic 
A tablespoon of neutral-tasting oil like peanut, grape 
seed, olive,.or com oil 
Japanese pumpkin
Salt or soy sauce, fish sauce, Hoisin sauce, oyster sauce 
A pinch of sugar 
Egg (optional)
The easiest way to peel a clove of garlic, if you're not 
using the whole vegetable or the sliced form, is to smash 
it with the side of the blade of a chef or Santoku knife, 
parallel to the surface of the board. Place the knife on top 
of the garlic, and with the other hand exert a significant 
force on the knife. The skin should separate naturally 
from the garlic. Once youve done this, you can mince 
the garlic.
For most cooking, I dont mind if the pieces of garlic are 
of different sizes. Some food authorities might say that if 
the garlic is not evenly minced, some pieces might bum
before others get brown. But I just cook until the smaller 
pieces start to brown and bigger ones are not so cooked. 
This way, you get a better depth of flavor with sweeter, 
cooked garlic and a more pungent aroma.
Slice the pumpkin into 1/8-inch thick pieces that are 
about 2 inches long. For Japanese pumpkin, I leave the 
green skin on. It's easier not to peel the pumpkin; the 
dish looks prettier this way and it adds to the taste.
You can only season the pumpkin with salt, and for 
this reason, it's better to get a local pumpkin from the 
farmers market, as, chances are, the flavor of pumpkin 
is better.
Of course, if you are stuck with a pumpkin from the 
supermarket, go with a heavy seasoning of soy, fish, 
oyster, and Hoisin sauce. For st regular serving size, start 
with a teaspoon of everything and give it a taste. If its 
too bland, add either Hoisin or oyster sauce, as they are 
not as salty as fish and soy sauce.
It is easier to put all the sauces on the raw pumpkin 
using the same bowl in which you prepared the 
pumpkin, or using the cutting board.
On medium to high heat, heat the oil in a wok, a pan, or 
a pot. When the oil starts to bubble, throw in the minced 
garlic and keep stirring, as ^bu want to evenly heat
the garlic. Once you start to smell the garlic, throw in 
the whole pumpkin mixed with the sauces. Stir so that 
everything is mixed well, add two tablespoons or 1/4 cup 
of water, and close the lid of the pot.
If you are using a pan, use more water, as it has a 
larger surface area. If you dont have a lid, you can put 
aluminum foil over your vessel and crimp the edges with 
a cloth.
The steam will cook the pumpkin, and its color will 
darken as it becomes a little transparent. If the pumpkin 
is too dry, add a little bit of water to it.
If you want to add egg, do it right before the pumpkin is 
cooked. Turn up the heat on the stove, push the pumpkin 
to the side of your pot, and add another tablespoon of oil. 
Crack an egg or two between the pumpkin mixture and 
break the yolk. Let the egg sit until it is cooked and then 
stir it in with the rest of the pumpkin.
Enjoy this dish with rice, or eat as a side dish with any 
Western, meat-based meal. You can serve it next to 
broiled T-bone steak (then skip the Asian sauce and use 
the salt instead), stir in with cooked pasta, or have it 
with Thanksgiving turkey.

Blood, fangs, and bats: Dracula comes to the Burgh
Pittsburgh Repertory Theatre reenacts Ted Tillers classic story of the Transylvanian vampire
An eerie voice, heavily laced with a foreign accent, 
greeted the audience as the show was about to begin. 
Pleeese turn off your cellular phones and refrain from 
text messageeing as eet disrupts the actors of the 
show... espeeecially Count Dracula." The announcement 
ended with an evil laugh. With such a start, it was 
evident that the play was going to be entertaining, albeit 
with a twist.
University of Pittsburgh Repertory Theatres presentation 
of Count Dracula was the perfect pre-Halloween treat
 a comedy about one of the most infamous horror 
characters of all time. The play, a comic retelling of the 
famous novel Dracula, was originally written by Ted Tiller 
in 1971 and was excellently reenacted by Pitt Rep.
The first thing that was noticeable about the play 
was the lavish sets. The gothic style of the room in 
which most of the scenes took place suited the mood 
of the play. The set was carefully detailed, right from 
the balcony doors that opened to a view of Count 
Dracula's castle to the suit of armor standing in the 
corner. The sets thus served to create the mood of the 
play and added a dark and mysterious air to the entire 
performance.
The story, which takes place in Dr. Sewards Asylum 
for the Criminally Insane, revolves around how 
Wilhelmina Mina Murray (played by Ana Noriega), 
who lives with the Sewards, is mysteriously ill after 
her first acquaintance with a newcomer in town  the 
Transylvanian Count Dracula (played by Sam Turich).
The play outlines the tribulations of Dr. Seward (played 
by Bruce McConachie), his German friend Helga Von 
Helsing (played by Elena Alexandratos), and Mina's 
fiance Jonathan Harker (played by Eric Prendergast), as 
they set out to try and kill the count, who they realize is 
a vampire.
Other characters, notably Dr. Sewards sister, Sybil 
(played by Holly Thuma), added excellent comic touches 
to the otherwise dark theme of the play. Sybils witty 
one-liners and fetish for drinking sherry made for some 
very good laughs. Cameron Crowe, who portrayed the 
character of Renfield, Draculas minion  as well as 
a ward of the asylum  and Noriega put on notable 
performances.
Crowes expressive acting while depicting an insane 
character was quite remarkable, as was Noriega's acting 
as she portrayed the personality change Mina underwent 
as she sank deeper and deeper under the vampires spell. 
Turichs evil smile and regal attitude as he depicted 
Count Dracula were also a pleasure to watch.
The performance was also full of a number of special 
effects that made the play all the more entertaining. One
such effect was that the light in the window of Draculas 
castle always went out when Dracula was supposedly on 
the move and* out of his house. Other effects also helped 
add to the enjoyment of watching the play  Count 
Dracula was able to pop up in a picture frame hung in 
the Sewards' house, the suit of armor in the room turned 
its head obligingly toward Dracula when he summoned 
it, and Dracula also turned into a bat in front of the 
audience, zooming right out of the stage over the heads 
of the astounded audience.
One of the most enjoyable scenes of the play was when 
Dracula was shown to be invisible. A ray of light hovered 
around the stage in this scene, indicating the presence 
of Dracula. When the ray fell upon a chair on the sets, the 
chair swung back and forth, and when it fell upon the 
couch in the room, a distinctive sound of feet rubbing 
against leather could be heard.
The highlight of the play was the very end. The 
characters were rushing to Dracula's tomb in this scene, 
and instead of entering the set from the wings, the
actors ran down to the stage by coming through the 
balcony seating area, walking amid the audience, and 
finally climbing down to the stage by a side staircase.
The actors also carried flashlights during this little chase, 
allowing the audience members to feel that they were a 
part of the story that was taking place.
Count Dracula thus boasted of some excellent special 
effects and great performances. Check out the 
performance for some Halloween fun. It provides spinetingling moments, but at the same time retains elements 
of a light-hearted comedy.

Scare hunting in the city
Too old for trick-or-treating? Discover the spookiest places in Pittsburgh
If you find yourself looking for something to do this 
Halloween (other than knocking on the doors of local 
Pittsburghers begging for fun-size chocolate bars), fear 
not. If youd like to stay relatively local, Allegheny County 
has a few great options ranging from amusement parks 
to haunted tunnels; the county offers several options if 
youre looking for some scares.
Phantom Fright Nights at Kennywood is your best bet. In 
addition to riding roller coasters in the dark, Kennywood 
offers seven attractions whose descriptive alliterations 
(Fear Festival, Mortem Manor, Villa of the Vampire, 
etc.) enhance the macabre atmosphere of the holiday. 
Kennywood is open on Fridays and Saturdays between 7 
p.m. and 1 a.m. Tickets cost $25.
'One attraction is the Hundred Acres Manor Haunted 
House, located in South Park. Here, visitors get to roam 
through the old house, meeting some ghosts and spirits 
along the way. And peoples desire to be scared will be 
appreciated by the folks at Hundred Acres Manor, as all 
of the proceeds from admission go directly to Animal 
Friends and the Allegheny County Homeless Childrens 
Education Fund. Hundred Acres Manor is open on 
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays between 7 and 10 
p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays between 7 and 11:30 
p.m. Tickets cost $13.
If youre looking for an unconventional (and free) way to 
spend Oct. 31, South Park Township is also home to two 
"haunted tunnels. According.to an urban legend, Green 
Mans Tunnel is home to a spirit of a man who hid away 
after he was electrocuted and disfigured. Not far away is 
Corvette Tunnel, the. alleged site of a drag-racing-gonewrong incident. Rumor has it that if you drive through 
the tunnel right as the clock strikes midnight, you can 
see the lights of a Corvette and hear screeching tires, a 
revving motor, and the racer's screams. Alongside this 
tunnel, theres a creek that also is believed to carry a 
dark history: Its said that a man chopped up his wife 
and tossed her body into the creek. And, of course, she 
couldnt resist coming back to haunt everyone, so its 
said that while walking through the tunnel, the wifes 
spirit will pull at your legs, begging for help.
Also in Allegheny County, the ScareHouse offers an 
experience a la The Shining by taking guests into the old 
Etna Elks Lodge. ScareHouse consists of three separate 
"haunts consisting of complex costumes and ghoulish 
make-up. Rampage thrusts you into an apocalypseesque war where zombies and mutants in gas masks lurk 
around corners; Delirium 3-D offers you a party inside 
a demented and deranged mind (complete with neon 
clowns), and The Hall of Nightmares is a walk through 
a house with angry clowns and a guy with no skin. If 
youre looking for a guaranteed thrill, its safe to say 
this one can do it for you, since Hauntworld Magazine 
has ranked ScareHouse the number 5 Best Haunted 
Attraction in the country and Travel Channel called 
it one of Americas Scariest Halloween Attractions. 
ScareHouse is open on Sundays and Tuesdays through 
Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m. and on Fridays and 
Saturdays from 7 p.m. to midnight. Tickets cost $17.
Outside the city, in the neighboring Washington County, 
are three chilling tours. First is Castle Blood, a highlyinteractive experience whose theme this year is "Night 
of the Vampire: The Dark is Calling. Castle Blood prides 
itself on the fact that it doesnt need any chainsaws or 
axes to deliver a scare factor, focusing instead on the 
characters and special effects. Castle Blood is open on 
Fridays through Sundays from 7 to 10 p.m. Tickets cost 
$13.
has been transformed to allow visitors to experience 
the horrors of the residence. Like Castle Blood, Demon 
House doesnt rely on chainsaws to give you the chills; 
instead, it plays upon the houses history (that nine men 
disappeared early on, and the house remained empty 
for 110 years) to give visitors a haunting experience. 
McCue Mansion is open on Sundays, Wednesdays, 
and Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m. and on Fridays and 
Saturdays from 1 p.m. to midnight. Tickets cost $17.
Reminiscent of something you might see on the Travel 
Channel, Nemacolin Castle serves as the site for ghost 
tours. While walking around the castle, illuminated 
only by candlelight, you can hear stories of others' 
experiences in Nemacolin. The castle is open on 
Saturdays and Sundays from 6 to 10 p.m. Tickets cost $7.
Even if you choose instead to dress up and tell jokes to 
folks in Squirrel Hill next Saturday, at least there is a 
haunted tunnel in South Park or a mansion with a dark 
history in Washington County available this weekend. 
Unfortunately, fun-size Kit Kat bars are not given out at 
any of these haunted castles.

Random Acts of Dance make the campus their stage
Jesse Kummer I Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is a campus well known for the 
rigorous coursework and the many hours of studying 
that students put into their academics. So, in order 
to lighten the load just a tad, Raymond Ejiofor 
brings Random Acts of Dance (RAD) to the campus. 
RAD is an event of DS Dance Company, which is 
a subsidiary of Dancers Symposium. Students 
work on choreography each week to perform every 
Wednesday at 12:20 p.m. at a new and random 
place on campus. These random acts of dance are 
selections from pieces that students are working on, 
as a part of the repertoire for the company, or just 
experimental pieces. "RAD was created to promote 
dance awareness and movement on campus 
and to explore dance in unconventional spaces, 
said Ejiofor. Some of the past performances have 
included the stage on CFA Lawn, the Fence, and 
the walkway between the Purnell Center and the 
University Center.
The performance is exactly what its name suggests: 
random. Unless you know what is going to happen, 
you will most likely be an innocent bystander who 
is lucky enough to witness the dancers taking their 
places on whatever campus spot has become their 
stage for the week. Walking across campus, you 
never know which direction to look in, because 
dancers may come from anywhere. The dancing 
starts out of nowhere and you almost have no idea 
whg the participants are as they start spreading 
out and moving at their own accord, very random 
indeed. The students work together to make the 
piece look separated and as spread out as possible, 
and they are placed many feet away from each 
other, covering a wide range of space. As the music 
climaxes and the performance comes together, 
they start to take shape and create a formation and 
perform a simultaneous dance.
The end of the dance finishes just as randomly as 
it begins. The performers walk away from their 
positions, pick up their bags, and head off to class 
or whatever other event they have planned at 12:30
p.m. The pieces never last for more than a few 
minutes, so if you are late, chances are you will miss 
the whole thing. But if you are around, you have 
the opportunity to witness RAD as they share their 
talent and abilities with the rest of campus and 
spread a bit of liveliness and joy to the crowd that 
gathers in between classes.
There are many different ways for students to 
express their creativity at Carnegie Mellon. RAD 
provides another outlet for these students to release 
their creative energy. I dance because I cant see 
myself doing anything else. Its what I think about 
when I wake up in the morning, its what makes me 
happy, and its what I am passionate about. I want 
to share this feeling with members of the campus 
community," said Ejiofor.
This is RADs first year on campus, and while it 
is in its incipient stages, it has been a success by 
drawing in a large audience at more than one of its 
presentations, creating major awareness. "I have 
never seen anything like this on campus. I was on 
my way to class and a girl started dancing in front of 
me. I wanted to see what she was doing so I stopped 
to watch. When I realized that she was part of a 
larger group of people, I became more interested.
It was very random, but I wouldnt mind seeing it 
again, Luke Johnson, a senior economics major, 
said.
In the years to come, Ejiofor says that he hopes to 
influence and inspire others to see their passions 
and interests outside of the classroom. While I may 
be laying down the foundation for this company, I 
hope this event, as well as the DS Dance Company, 
become well recognized and able to influence the 
campus, as well as the Pittsburgh community 
through the arts."

You have been bitten by a fiend. You suffer 1d4 constitution damage.
Being haunted by the jilted mistress of the former homeowner wont be 
that bad, as long as you obtain a sizable quantity of earplugs.
Your superstitious nature will toe justified when you are visited by the 
Ghost of Christmas Past. However, it will arrive at 6 p.m. instead of 4:00 
a.m. due to time zone confusion:
You have been eaten by a grue.
It will take time to get used to, but a group of ghosts has set up a timeshare of your left arm. The stars tell me the guy who got the first week 
of June is very messy.
Youre a little old to be going from house to house trick-or-treating. 
However, if you bring your grandson along, everyone will think it is 
adorable and give you candy anyway.
When all else fails, and it will, you can always resort to burning the 
house down to purge your mother-in-laws spirit from your beautiful 
home.
After last years banshee episode, you were hoping to get through this 
Halloween with no incidents. It turns out the banishing ritual was only 
good for one year. You should have gotten the premium version.
You have no problems with the Monster Mash or the Zombie Jamboree; 
you just wish they would turn the volume down a bit; humans are trying 
to sleep, after all.
Your non-superstitious nature will be challenged when you walk under 
a ladder, see a black cat, break a mirror, and spill salt on the next 
Friday the 13th. Nothing particularly bad happens, but that cant be a 
coincidence.
Yes, the jack-o-lanterns eyes are following you. No, it wont eat you. 
Actually, I cant promise that.
Dont be afraid to go trick-or-treating this year. College students are 
basically small children anyway.

scotch ball.
Cassie Wallace | Photo Staff
Last Saturday, the Ballroom Dance Club held Carnegie Mellon's first 
ever ballroom dance competition, called Scotch Ball, in Rangos Hall 
in the University Center. This was a practice competition that helped 
participants prepare for the upcoming intercollegiate ballroom dancing 
competitions. After the Scotch Ball, two workshops were held for all 
levels of dancers.
