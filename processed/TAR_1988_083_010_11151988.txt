In an effort to influence the 
Carnegie Mellon Board of Trus
tees and to educate students, 
the Coalition for a Free South 
Africa (CFSA) constructed a 
shanty on the Cut last Thursday.
The main purpose of the shanty 
is to help draw more attention 
to the CFSA sponsored Teach-In 
for a Free South Africa, according 
to CFSA President Havard Al
bright and member Seth 
Kaufman. The Teach-In was held 
yesterday to coincide with the 
annual Board of Trustees meet
ing.
Carnegie Mellon has a policy of
partial divestment, according to 
Albright. The Trustees decided to 
withdraw all the schools hold
ings in South Africa but to keep 
investments in other companies 
that are not divested. CFSA 
member Matt Judd explained that 
the group is telling CMU, Dont 
deal with other companies who 
are invested in South Africa.
In an interview inside the 
shanty Albright stated, There is 
only one policy and that is the 
policy of total divestment. He 
added that when the Trustees 
announced that they voted to pull 
out the schools investments from 
South Africa, They made a point 
of saying that theyre not divest
ing [from other companies]. In
addition, according to Judd, the 
current policy enables the school 
to accept donations from such 
invested companies.
The Teach-In, geared to edu
cate students on the situation in 
South Africa had several events 
scheduled yesterday. From 8 am 
to 9 am: demonstration for total 
divestment outside of the Soft
ware Engineering Institute, 
where the meeting was held.
According to Albright, almost 
400 people have expressed inter
est and support in the groups 
cause since the shanty was put 
up. When the trustees go back to 
their hotel rooms and turn on the 
news and see 400 people protest83,Is,ue1 3, 0Caer n

As part of its Basket Bucks

rosis, ThetaXi will sponsor an ex
hibition basketball game between 
a team of Greek All-Stars and 
members of the Liquor Control 
Board (LCB), Pittsburgh Police, 
and Public Safety Departments.
The Basket Bucks 88 tourna
ment will be held Saturday No
vember 19 in Skibo Gymnasium 
beginning at 9 am.
The game against the police 
team will be played at 5:30 pm. 
The game comes exactly 52 weeks 
after last years LCB raid on two 
Carnegie Mellon fraternities, in 
which 150 students were arrested. 
Basket Bucks 88 Co-Chairman 
Mark Samber says the slogan for 
the game is A year later: on the 
courts, not in the courts.
Each of the eight fraternities 
and eight independent organiza
tions in the Basket Bucks 88 
tournament will be invited to send 
its most popular player to play on 
the Greek All-Stars team. Sam
ber said he hopes having each 
teams most popular player on 
the All-Star team will encourage 
a good turnout for the game and 
tournament in general.
Samber also said that he had 
originally hoped to have the AllStars play a team made up exclu
sively of LCB officers. He was told 
that the LCB does not have 
enough officers off duty on week
ends to make up a team. It was 
agreed that the LCB team would 
be supplemented with police and 
public safety personel. Margaret 
Rizzo, of the Public Safety De
partment, said that the police and

Provost defends contracts
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Staffwriter
Provost Angel Jordan delivered the sec
ond lecture in the two-part series Sci
ence, the Military, Universities, and You 
on Monday, November 7 in the Adamson 
Wing.
About sixty undergraduate and gradu
ate students, faculty, and members of the 
community attended the talk.
The first lecture in the series was given 
October 31 by Prof. Charles Schwartz, 
professor of physics at the University of 
California at Berkeley. Basically, 
Schwartzs position was that universities 
should not engage in military research.
Jordan began his speech by stating that 
his talk was not a rebuttal of Schwartzs 
lecture. However, he addressed many of 
Schwartzs points throughout his speech, 
and on many points Jordan asserted that 
he and Schwartz agreed.
Several times throughout the lecture,
Jordan asserted that his role was to in
form the audience, who as a part of the 
system, had the responsibility to make 
informed choices.
Jordans main point throughout his lec
ture was that there are many sources from 
which funds for university research come, 
mainly the government and private indus
try. He asserted that these two sectors 
differ only in their motives for funding re
search.
Private corporations, he explained, fund 
research in universities not outof philan
thropy, but in the hopes that the technol
ogy produced will eventually result in a 
profit. Likewise, he said government agen
cies, especially the Department of Defense 
(DoD), fund research in the hopes that the 
results will help to promote national secu
rity.
Jordan reminded the audience that all 
of the research conducted at CMU is to
tally unclassified.
Jordan called Schwartzs claim that
research in science and technology is full 
of surprises an understatement.-Jor
dan said, however, that he could disagree 
that such surprises destabilize the arms 
race.
Interpreting Schwartzs plan to have 
the United States and Soviet Union coop
erate on weapons research, Jordan argued 
that even Schwartz accepts some form of 
continuing weapons-related research. As 
for Schwartzs statement that students 
and faculty should make considered, in
formed choices, Provost Jordan declared 
that he was in one-hundred-percent agree
ment.
Attending Jordans lecture was Vincent 
Eirene, well-known on campus for his 
protest activity against the Software En
gineering Institute (SEI).
Even during the question and answer 
period following Jordans talk, Eirene did 
not respond to any of Jordans points. One 
of Eirenes supporters, however, accused

MCS considers change in core
By CARLOS FRANCO
Tartan News Editor
A proposal to change the Mel
lon College of Science (MCS) core 
curriculum was submitted to the 
College Council by the MCS Cur
riculum Committee on October 
28.
At present, the MCS core con
sists of six MCS courses: Modern 
Biology, Modern Chemistry, Cal
culus, Calculus with Linear Alge
bra, Physics I, and Physics II in 
addition to Introduction to Com
puting for Engineering and Sci
ence (15-111). These courses must 
be taken freshman year with the 
exception that one course can be 
taken the first semester sopho
more year. '
According to the controversial 
proposal, It is proposed that in 
place of requiring the six MCS 
courses named above, we require
students to take six courses from 
an approved list of MCS courses. 
Furthermore, no more than two 
courses from any one department 
can be used to satisfy this re
quirement. The proposal would 
not affect the programming 
course.
A report on the proposal, which 
was submitted to, the College 
Council, stated that although the 
proposal did manage to ' pass 
through the MCS Curriculum 
Committee both discussion and 
votes were extremely divided.
Chairman of the MCS Curricu
lum Subcommittee Dr. Steven 
Shreve stated that the vote on the 
proposal was 9-7. On the proposal 
itself Shreve felt, it is unlikely 
fto pass the College Council].
There is student input through
out the process to change the 
curriculum, according to Associ
ate Dean of MCS Juan Schaffer.
On the MCS Committee there are 
both graduate and undergradu
ate students. Schaffer added that 
students are also represented on 
the College Council, which must 
accept or refuse the curriculum 
proposal.
Applied math major Kevin 
Poecking stated, The division was 
not only in the committee but in 
everyones minds.
According to Schaffer, the main 
argument for proposed change in 
the Curriculum is that it will al
low students to have more free
dom and allow them to concen
trate on an area of interest.
Biology Department Head 
Susan Henry said that the Biol
ogy Department is against the 
proposal. She added that in her 
opinion the Math Department is 
in favor of the proposal while the 
Chemistry Department is against 
it. Henry also stated that the
Physics Departments stance on 
the proposal is split.
Henry stated that her depart
ment was against the proposal, 
and the discussion they had on it 
was purely philosophical. She 
stated that the question that the 
Biology faculty asked was What 
does it take to produce an edu
cated scientist?
The Biology Department did not 
want to accept this proposal be
cause it felt that, in Henrys words, 
the students should receive a 
broad exposure to sciences.
Chemistry was also opposed to 
the change in the curriculum but 
for a slightly different reason  
abuse. Acting Chemistry Depart
ment Head Aksel Bothner-By 
stated that faculty did not like 
this particular proposal... because 
the system is subject to abuses 
like no math or no physics. He

Alumnus contributes books to Hunt
The Hunt Library has received a collection of more than 2,000 
science fiction books from John Herzog, a 1937 chemical engi
neering alumnus. Herzog, a high school teacher of chemistry and 
.physics for 30 years before retiring in 1982, describes science fic.tion as usually an extrapolation of present-day knowledge to 
predict what trends will be 50 or 100 years from now. Science fic
tion had atom bombs 20 years before the real one, Herzog says. 
They had men on the moon 50 years before it really happened. 
Those forward-looking predictions have come through so often 
that its just fascinating to read. Thomas J. Michalak, Director 
of University Libraries, says there is a great deal of interest 
among our students in science fiction. We are very happy to 
; receive this collection, and we hope that Mr. Herzogs generosity 
' will encourage others to donate books to the library.
University receives $40,000 grant 
for drug and alcohol education
The University Committee on Alcohol and Drug Education 
; (CADE) has received $40,000 from the Fund for Improvement of 
Post Secondary Education, the federal agency which provides 
resources for drug and alcohol abuse prevention. Dr. Lorrie Rabin 
of the Counseling Center says that the committee met for a year 
to plan an innovative program which includes a peer educational 
network in which students will be trained to offer informative 
presentations and make appropriate referrals of students with 
substance abuse difficulties to campus and community profes
sionals. Group therapy will be offered to students whose lives are 
affected by substance abuse and a theme week is planned for Feb
ruary 6-10. Committee members are from Student Affairs, Health 
Services, the Counseling Center, university administration, fac
ulty, and the student body.

Soviets suspend 
Afghan troop 
withdrawals
MOSCOW (AP)  A top For
eign Ministry spokesman said 
Monday that the Soviet Union had 
suspended removing its forces 
from Afghanistan because of the 
strength of attacks by anti-gov
ernment rebels, and hinted the 
withdrawal might not be com
pleted by the Feb. 15 deadline.
The Soviet troops are being 
withdrawn due to the goodwill of 
the Soviet government, First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexan
der Bessmertnykh told a news 
conference. They will be with
drawn in honorable conditions.
The current atmosphere of 
heavy attacks by insurgents with 
arms supplied by the United 
States, Pakistan and other coun
tries does not provide conditions 
for such a withdrawal of Soviet 
troops, Bessmertnykh said.
The Soviet Union says supply of 
arms to the rebels violates the 
April 14 agreement under which 
the Soviet Union already has 
withdrawn half of its 100,000 sol
diers and has promised to remove 
the remaining soldiers by Feb. 15.
Soviet Union offers 
summit with Bush
MOSCOW (AP)  The Soviet 
Union said Wednesday that it 
expected to be able to work for 
peace and disarmament with 
George Bush, who it character
ized as a close follower of Presi
dent Reagan.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev congratulated President
elect George Bush and said he 
hopes the new administration will 
contribute to further development 
of U.S.-Soviet relations.
The Soviet Union is ready to 
continue and deepen mutually 
beneficial Soviet-American coop
eration on a broad range of is
sues, the Kremlin leader said in a 
brief congratulatory message to 
Bush carried by Tass, the Soviet 
news agency.
Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Gennady I. Gerasimov had told a 
briefing two weeks ago that the 
Soviets would like a prompt sum
mit meeting with the next U.S. 
president.
Bush said Tuesday that he is 
interested in a summit meeting 
that produces progress in some 
area of superpower relations.
Bush offers to work 
with Congress, 
hints at policies
HOUSTON (DJ)  In his first 
post-election press conference, 
Wednesday, President-elect 
George Bush appeared to hold 
out an olive branch to Congress 
by saying, I dont think I was 
particularly in a Congress-bash
ing mode during the campaign.
Bush also said he intends to 
give his Vice President, Dan 
Quayle, complete access to intel
ligence and other sensitive infor
mation because it is essential for 
the vice president to be up to 
speed on every sensitive matter 
facing the White House.
Bush said people at various 
levels may be asked to remain in 
the Bush administration but he 
noted he hopes to reinvigorate 
the government by bringing in 
new blood.
On foreign policy topics Bush 
said that aid to the Nicaraguan 
resistance, the Contras, will have 
a high priority in his admini
stration because of the importance 
of promoting freedom and democ
racy in the western hemisphere.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D.- 
Mass) predicted Tuesday night 
that a Democrat-controlled Con
gress would be able to cooperate 
on economic policy with Republi
can George Bush in the presi
dency.
House Speaker Jim Wright said 
he spoke with President-elect 
George Bush by telephone and 
assured Bush that he personally 
would be available to. help the 
next president.
Wright claimed the election
provided a strong vote of confi
dence for the progressive ac
tions of the outgoing 100th Con
gress.
The voters provided a mandate 
to both President-elect Bush and 
the Democrat-controlled Congress 
to try to find a way to work to
gether, Wright said.
Democrats do well 
in state elections
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Democrats retained decisive control of 
the U.S. Congress and added to 
their strength in statehouses 
throughout the U.S. Tuesday, as 
ticket-splitting voters gave the 
party an edge even where Repub
lican George Bush handily won 
the presidency.
Connecticut Republican Sen. 
Lowell Weicker, whose career in 
Congress spans two decades, was 
defeated by the states Democratic 
attorney general, Joseph Lieberman. In New Jersey, Ohio and 
North Dakota, Democratic Sena
tors Frank Lautenberg, Howard 
Metzenbaum and Quentin Bur
dick respectively turned back Re
publican challenges.
In West Virginia and Indiana, 
Democrats Gaston Caperton and 
Evan Bayh, the son of former U.S. 
Senator Birch Bayh, took gover
norships held by Republicans.
The most notable Republican 
House victory was the defeat of 
powerful House Banking Com
mittee Chairman Fernand St 
Germain of Rhode Island by at
torney and businessman Ronald 
Machtly.
The Democratic Vice Presiden
tial nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen 
of Texas, reflected the pattern in 
the elections Tuesday.
He won his fourth term as sena
tor even as the Democratic na
tional ticket lost in his state.
B-1B bombers 
grounded for 
safety inspections
WASHINGTON (AP)The Air 
Force temporarily grounded its 
B-1B long-range bombers for a 
safety inspection last Monday 
following a crash of one of the 
planes last Sunday in Texas.
The Strategic Air Command, 
which is responsible for the landbased nuclear bomber and mis
sile forces, said the order was a 
normal precaution in the wake 
of a major accident. All four crew
men aboard the craft safely ejected 
before the crash.
The flight suspension order was 
to be be followed within 24 to 48 
hours by specific instructions to 
B-1B mechanics on what aircraft 
systems they must inspect, a SAC 
spokesman said. He said the in
spection is expected to take two to 
four hours per aircraft, after which
the aircraft will return to flying 
status.
The spokesman said the fljgfy 
suspension order would not affect 
the B-lBs currently standi^ 
alert, ready for immediate take, 
off in the event of nuclear war.
Reagan must cut 
1990 budget
WASHINGTON (DJ)  While 
George Bush savors his victory

Under the Gramm-Rudmari

CMU acts on black students requests
JONATHAN LEVY
\'jrtan Assistant News Editor
Last month 37 black students, led by 
Ipjrit President Nicole Austin, held a
emonstration jn the Student Affairs
ffice to protest insensitivity towards 
lacks at Carnegie Mellon.
[phe students stayed in the office of 
ssociate Dean of Student Affairs Lois 
oX for nearly an hour, discussing their 
jncerns with Cox, Dean of Student 
(Tail's Brad Walter, Student Ombudsan Michael Murphy, and Legal Advi,r Ron Campana.
The following week, on October 13,
anyof the same students met in
pherty Hall 2210 with a large group of 
culty and administrators including 
)X. Walter, Provost Angel Jordan, 
&SS Dean Steven Fienberg, CIT/MCS 
ean Robert Kail, and Assistant to the 
rector of University Libraries Sylverna 
ord.
According to Cox, the meeting was 
nstructive. She reported that It was 
it at all defensive or confrontative. It 
as more informational... It was, I felt, 
very good meeting. Cox said that the' 
eeting covered many things that the 
udents would like to see changed at 
arnegie Mellon.
The changes discussed include adding 
id modifying courses in order to teach 
e about ethnic studies, increasing 
forts to recruit more black faculty memrs, and the formation of an ethnic 
udies section in Hunt library.
Many of the students suggestions are 
ling implemented. Cox said a section 
[dressing ethnic intimidation will be 
Ided to next years student handbook, 
will define the problem and offer solu)ns similar to those for sexual harassent.
At the request of the students, the Stugjent Affairs office is also considering 
ring a minority work-study student, 
ox explained, however, that this does 
)t constitute a major change from the 
evious policy because the Student 
(fairs office has always hired students 
ised on the times they were available to 
ork, regardless of race.
The H&SS college is considering the 
rriculum changes requested by the 
ack students.Fienberg and other H&SS 
culty members have met with black
photo by Andy Gillespie
Black students demostrate in the Student Affairs office on October 6. After a number 
of meetings the Universtiy has begun to adopt some of the Students requests.
students, including Austin, to discuss 
what changes should be made.
Although he is open to changes in the 
H&SS curriculum and core, Fienberg 
noted that any changes that occur will 
take time and will not be as all-encom
passing as some may expect.
Fienberg explained that current 
courses address ethnic issues well, say
ing, It turns out that if you look at the 
History Departments offering, there are 
actually a substantial number of courses 
that relate to ethnic groups; Afro-Americans, Africans, African history, [etc.], 
Fienberg said, The issue is who can get 
to those [courses] and at what point in 
their academic schedule.
H&SS students have no problems in 
scheduling these courses, stated Fien
berg, but students in the other colleges 
may run into difficulties.
Fienberg said the black students asked 
him to concentrate on three courses in 
particular; World History, ReadingTexts, 
and Decision Processes in American 
Political Institutions. Fienbergfeels that 
few changes will be necessary in these 
classes.
World History and Reading Texts al
ready cover the history of many ethnic 
groups, including blacks, stated Fien
berg. He explained that because of the 
nature of the course, Decision Processes 
in American Political Institutions does
not have many possibilities for dealing 
with ethnic history.
Another of the black students requests 
had been for H&SS to reinstate the class 
Social Influence. Fienberg said that this 
is not likely to happen. He explained that 
the class was dropped because it was not 
meeting the needs of either students or 
faculty. He also said that the course was 
not what the black students believe it 
was. He said it only covered ethnic diver
sity in one section taught in one particu
lar year.
Fienberg said he is working on an 
ethnic studies minor to be offered in 
H&SS. He is currently looking at exist
ing courses containing segments on eth
nic issues to see if enough exist to begin 
offering the minor next fall.
If these courses do not exist, Fienberg 
said he will try to alter current courses or 
develop new ones in order to create the 
new minor. He does not know how long it 
would take to do this. According to Fien
berg, it is difficult to create new courses 
because of budget limitations and other 
factors. Fienberg believes that it will be 
easier to make changes in existing 
courses by adding a few lectures and 
changing some assignments in particu
lar classes.
The Deans office does not create 
courses and have things happen over
night, Fienberg said. He added that
much of the power to change courses lies 
with the departments and professors who 
teach them.
The issue of minority faculty members 
is a serious one according to Fienberg. 
Recruiting minority faculty is a major 
issue and we actually take that very se
riously, Fienberg said, We dont do well, 
but we take it seriously. He said the 
problem lies in finding people who fill 
the Universitys needs among the small 
pool of blacks with PhDs. He said We 
would love to have new ways of generat
ing names of potential minority faculty.
Fienberg feels progress is being made 
in addressing the problems of minority 
students at Carnegie Mellon. I person
ally. . . think that were on a good track 
that the students feel pleased about.
One of the black students other re
quests, an ethnic studies area in Hunt 
library, is also being implemented. Ford 
met with Austin and two other students 
on November 3 and they discussed a list 
of materials the students wished to see 
in the library.
Hunt already owned 90 percent of the 
materials, stated Ford. All of the others 
that are still in print have been ordered 
at a total cost of $450.
Ford will hold another meeting with 
Austin and other students on November 
17. She said that At that time we will be 
looking at additional materials that 
might be appropriate to be added to the 
collection. We will be identifying addi
tional subscriptions that might be ap
propriate, and generally looking at any
thing else that needs to be done in the 
library to make sure that our collections 
maintain currency and appropriateness 
in ethnic areas.
Ford says future additions will be 
handled through the normal collection 
development procedures.
Because of space limitations, the eth
nic studies section will not be in a par
ticular section of the library. Ford said 
the materials will be distributed through
out the library and students will be able 
to locate them through the on-line cata
log.
The black students group did not ob
ject to this, according to Ford. She said, 
The group agreed that it was not as 
important to have a separate ethnic 
Studies section as it was to have the 
materials in the collection.

During the course of his speech, 
Provost Jordan stated that as a 
champion of computer science, he 
had been instrumental in helping to 
bring the Software Engineering

Nobel laureate speaks 
to physics department
Lederman re
ferred to the Big 
Bang as 'Fermilab 
with an unre
stricted budget.
gy ERIC W. LEULDETTE
fartan Contributing Editor
Leon M. Lederman, one of the 
ffinners of the 1988 Nobel Prize 
in Physics, gave the physics collo
quium in Wean 7500 last Mon
day. In May Lederman was 
jwardedanhonorarydegreefrom 
Carnegie Mellon.
The topic of his talk was Phys
ics at the Tevatron. At present, 
^ederman is director of the Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory
Fermilab) in ___________________
Jatavia, Illiiois.
Fermilab is 
he most powrful acceleraor in the(
orld. Four 
iles* in cirimference, it 
used to 
tudy the naire of high-energy particles. 
Many scientists expect Ferrilab to discover particles preicted by the standard model of 
jeoretical physics.
Monday afternoon Lederman 
nswered questions asked by 
jidergraduate and graduate 
hysics students at an informal 
iscussion. Many of the questions 
oncerned the proposed multiillion dollar Superconducting 
iuper Collider (SSC).
Lederman indicated that he 
nought the SSC would be the 
ast accelerator ever built. The 
lowerful machine would employ 
500 physicists and would proide thousands of construction 
>bs. Lederman suggested that it 
ould be completed by 1999.
The new accelerator would 
tudy physics under conditions 
irailar to those at the beginning 
fthe universe. With characterishumor, Lederman referred to 
ie Big Bang as Fermilab with 
n unrestricted budget. 
Lederman was hopeful that the 
SC would be constructed in Illijois with Fermilab as an injector
Lederman as a very different 
character from other high-energy 
physicists who have won the Nobel 
Prize, who are known to be not 
nice guys and who dont particu
larly care about teaching. Leder
man has established Saturday 
physics programs for Illinois high 
school students. He also convinced 
the governor of Illinois to estab
lish a school for students gifted in 
science.
A long-time member of the 
physics department commented 
___________________ on the honor
ary degree Le
derman was 
awarded, We

ministration 
wants us to do 
 we nomi
nated some
body who was 
about to win 
the Nobel Prize. The colloquium 
was scheduled months before the 
announcement that Lederman 
had won the prize.
The 1988 Nobel Prize in Phys
ics was awarded to Lederman, 
Melvin Schwartz, and JackSteinbergerfortheirworkfrom 1960 to 
1962 with neutrino beams. They 
discovered a previously unknown 
type of neutrino. The prize will be 
presented on Dec. 8 in Stockholm..
Lederman joked that when he 
got a phone call from the Nobel 
committee, he at first thought that 
it was for another, more recent 
discovery. Though he is primarily 
an administrator, Lederman is 
still an active researcher.
Next year Lederman plans to 
retire as director of Fermilab and 
teach freshman physics at the 
University of Chicago.
Physics professor Richard Edelstein hosted both the colloquium 
and the discussion. Edelstein, who 
as a graduate student worked with 
Lederman, was instrumental in 
bringinghim to speak on campus.

list of Nobel Prize winners who
Historic prints stolen from classrooms
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Someone is stealing Carnegie 
Mellons history, and there is 
nothing Campus Police can do 
about it.
Over the last year, 11 framed 
photographs depicting scenes 
from CMUs past have been sto
len from various classrooms 
after the rooms were renovated 
by the Educational Facilities 
Committee. The framed, black 
and white prints cost $70 each 
to hang; unframed copies cost 
$3 at the archives in Hunt Li
brary.
The Educational Facilities 
Committee, establishedin 1984 
by then Vice-President Patrick 
Crecine, funded and hung the 
pictures as part of its $1.2 mil
lion classroom renovation ef
fort. However, despite perma
nent mounts drilled into the 
walls and regular classroom 
patrols by Campus Police, the 
photos are disappearing, leav
ing behind nothing but ugly 
mounts jutting from the walls.
Since classes are taught at 
night and classrooms are used
by many extra-curricular organi
zations in the evenings, Campus 
Police cannot lock the rooms 
where these pictures have been 
hung, according to Campus Po
lice Sergeant Bill Ricci.
Short of removing the remain
ing pictures or moving them into 
department offices which are 
locked at night, Ricci isnt opti
mistic that they can be secured in 
their present locations. It would 
take a combination of some kind 
of alarm and a firm mounting to 
keep these pictures from being 
stolen, said Ricci.
Unfortunately, the cost of 
alarming every picture is too high 
and the stolen pictures will proba
bly not be replaced, said Educa
tional Facilities Committee 
Chairman Ted Fenton. We put 
those pictures up to bring a touch 
oftraditiontothisplace andmake 
it a really attractive learning en
vironment, but our budget is not 
unlimited, explained Fenton.
Nonetheless, the administra
tion has given the 13-person 
committee free reign over 
$300,000 per year to improve 
educational facilities which are 
used in common by all depart
ments. Originally composed of 
only Ryan teaching-award win
ners, the Committee has grown to 
include University Planning, the 
Architects office, Design and 
Construction, the Registrar, and 
Instructional Technology, accord
ing to a report written for the 
Resource and Capital Allocation 
Boards in February 1988.
This is the only university in 
the country that gives its faculty 
members $300,000 to mess with 
facilities, said Fenton. Every
one told us it wouldnt work, but it 
is working.
Since its inception the Commit
tee has made the following rec
ommendations:
Establish a standing commit
tee to advise and assist in the 
planning and design of educa
tional facilities.
Designate one administrator 
as a classroom Czar responsible 
for coordinating classroom main
tenance.
 Increase annual budget expen
ditures for audio-visual and 
graphic delivery and production 
services without charge to depart
ments.
Increase the amount of money
Educational Facilities Committee 
Chairman Ted Fenton
spent on facility renovations.
Upgrade educational labo
ratories.
Build three new lecture 
halls.
Increase allocations for li
brary acquisitions annually.
According to the February re
port, the Committee has 
achieved the first four goals 
and is moving on to the final 
three.
Fenton said that he wants to 
concentrate on labs and stu
dent spaces such as the Wean 
Hall fifth-floor lobby this sum

ing, that should influence them 
in some way, said Albright.
Following the protest, lectures 
with guest speakers and special 
classes were scheduled to be held 
around campus, includingformer 
South African political prisoner 
and current University of Pitts
burgh faculty member, Dennis 
Brutus.
Flyers distributed by the CFSA 
told students not to go to their 
classes and attend the Teach-In. 
Some professors including 
Johnothan Pressler and Ernie Al
ieva cancelled their regular 
classes so that their students 
could attend attend the Teach-In 
events; Pressler was scheduled to 
give a lecture and hold a discus
sion group.
According to Albright, students 
who do not want to attend the 
Teach-In will not be penalized. 
[The professors] areleavingitup 
to the students discretion, he 
said.
Two years ago, the now defunct 
Students Against Apartheid 
(SAA) built a shanty for the same 
purpose. According to Albright, 
Students Against Apartheid was 
organized by and for students. In 
addition to Carnegie Mellon, the 
organization also had a very ac
tive branch at the University of
Pittsburgh.
Albright explained that a lot of 
alumni who were part of SAA, as 
well as faculty, wanted to still be 
involved with the campaign for 
divestment in some way.
Therefore the group changed 
its name and its policy. Now that 
were a 'coalition, students, fac
ulty, staff and even administra
tion can become involved, said 
Albright. He added that the group 
has about 15 to 20 active mem
bers.
The purpose of the shanty is a
bit different from the one built 
two years ago. That shanty, ac
cording to Albright, Changed [the 
Universitys] freedom of speech 
policy.
In addition to making a state
ment about apartheid, SAA es
tablished that student protest 
could take place on Carnegie Mel
lon property.
As of yet, the CFSAis not recog
nized nor funded by Student Sen
ate. By Senates definition we 
are a political group, said Al
bright. Currently, Senate will not
allocate funds to any campus 
organization deemed political. 
Albright said that the group will 
try to get recognition later this 
year, but will not worry about it 
now.
Next semester, the group is; 
planning a concert to help raise 
awareness about the situation in 
South Africa. Its still very tenta
tive, said Albright, the events 
organizer, but well have five 
bands and some other student 
organizations said they would 
help out with it.

Shanty is not effective
Most people agree that protest
ing Apartheid is a noble cause. 
But the most important effect of a 
protest is educating others about 
the cause.
Many students remember the 
first shanty, constructed by Stu
dents Against Apartheid (SAA) in 
1985, which unquestionably 
alerted some students to a num
ber of important issues.
That shanty symbolized a broad 
form of protest and represented 
the conditions under which many 
South African blacks must live. It 
increased the awareness about 
South Africa, Apartheid, divest
ment, homelands, and Namibia.
The shanty of two years ago 
raised awareness through subtle 
means. For example, it was named 
Biko Hall, which introduced many 
students to Stephen Biko, the 
black leader killed a decade ago.
Two years ago Dennis Brutus, 
an exiled South African and the 
University of Pittsburghs Chair 
of Black Studies, spoke at the 
shanty. He gave a firsthand ac
count of being black in South 
Africa, which is necessary to truly 
understand the issues involved.
With the protest centered
around the shanty on campus, 
students did not have to make as 
concerted an effort to become more 
aware of the Universitys position 
on divestment and South Africa.
Now, the SAA has been replaced 
by the Coalition for a Free South 
Africa (CFSA), which has been 
less effective. The protest this year 
is centered around a Teach-in, 
rather than the shanty, which will 
not attract the attention of the 
general University community.
This comes at a time when bring
ing attention to Apartheid and 
South Africa is more important 
than ever. Now that the South 
African government censors the 
news reported by foreign journal
ists, attention has been diverted 
from the horrors of Apartheid.
Also, with President Cyerts 
indication that CMU will infor
mally divest its portfolio of South 
African stocks, the issue of divest
ment has lost a considerable 
amount of local attention. The 
CFSA needs to do much more than 
just call for Divestment for real.
Now, at a time when the shanty 
should be attracting attention, its 
only being ignored. The CFSAhas 
made an important issue banal.
At last, were 100 Americans
At long last, the presidential 
campaign has ended. We would 
like to extend our congratulations 
to President-elect George Bush 
and our sympathies to Governor 
Michael Dukakis. It was a long, 
hard-fought, and sometimes nasty 
campaign but now it is over and 
time for supporters of both candi
dates to come together behind the 
new administration.
Thomas Jefferson, who also 
fought a brutal campaign in 1801, 
called for cooperation in his inaugural address with the words, We 
are all Republicans, we are all 
Federalists. In this reference to 
the major political parties, Jeffer
son was saying that elections point 
out differences between us but we 
have far more in common.
We are all Republicans. We are 
all Democrats. Most importantly, 
we are all Americans and on 
January 20 George Bush will 
become our president. Lets all 
work together to make this coun
try the best it can be - for all of us.
Truly honorary degrees
As the University begins the se
lection process of this years hon
orary degree recipients, we hope 
the members of the Honorary 
Degree Committee make the same 
insightful decisions as last year.
Two of the five degree recipients 
have gained national attention 
since their degrees were conferred 
last May: Dick Thornburgh re
placed Ed Meese as Attorney 
General and Leon Leberman re
ceived the Nobel Prize in Physics.
These men were ideal candi
dates. Honorary Degrees may be
conferred... in recognition of crea
tive work, eminent scholarship, 
or distinguished public service, 
according to the Trustees Hand
book.
These candidates were selected 
because of their integrity, charac
ter, and national standing  not 
for the amount of money they 
contributed to the University.
The members of the Honorary 
Degree Committee did an admi
rable job last year; lets hope they 
keep those same ideals in mind 
again this year.

CMU events, and attacking those who 
find these symbols deeply offensive 
[Confederate flag symbol of pride, not 
racism, 10/25]. Yes, we all know that 
not all the good guys were in the North 
during the Civil War, and not all the bad 
guys were in the South, and we also 
know that there is still no clear cut geo
graphical division of morality here in 
this country or any place else in the 
world. But we also know that the good 
men who died in that war, defending a 
way of life, defended a way of life that 
included slavery, and we also know that 
one hundred years of violence and re
pression against blacks continued in the 
South after the war, and that those who 
supported this repression wrapped them
selves in the symbol of the confederate 
flag and, in general, the symbolism of the 
Souths defiance. This includes even the 
filth of the KKK. (I refer Mr. Potter to the

totally ignorant of all current events and 
recent history.) Perhaps Mr. Potter is too 
young to remember, but many of my 
generation were beaten, jailed and even 
killed trying to change the lovely eth
nic (sic) life style he seems to find so 
charming in retrospect.
I am appalled that a person can be
come a senior at an institution like CMU 
without gaining any understanding along 
the way of the nature and power of 
symbols. Symbols are a product of, and 
in a sense belong to, the cultures that 
produce them. Mr. Potter, no matter how 
good his intentions might be, can not 
redefine the confederate flag to mean all 
the good things he would like it to mean, 
and none of the despicable things which 
others have used it for. It is a cultural 
product and means what people have 
used it to mean. Hatred, racism, repres
sion, and violence are certainly among 
the most frequently intended meanings
of this symbol. Perhaps Mr. Potter shoulc 
take a lesson from several of the Nativi 
American tribes of the Southwest. Thejt 
tribes have ceased to use a centuries oU 
symbol of theirs, known to us as th 
swastika, (which to them meant tli 
center of the four comers of the world] 
because it has taken on such a deeplt 
offensive symbolism to the rest of th 
world. (Through no fault of their ovrqj 
obviously.)
If Mr. Potter does not have the cow 
tesy and sensitivity to refrain from th 
use of this symbolism, one would hop 
that he would at least have the courtes 
to be quiet when the victims of the attj 
tudes and sections represented by th 
symbols he chooses to display voice thei 
hurt and anger. Whatever he may thin 
in his ignorance and youth, Mr. Potteri 
not the victim in this situation. Perhap 
the confederate flag will be less offensiv 
when there is no longer anyone alive \vh

Editor:
The Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI) is a Defense Department research 
and development facility that is man
aged by Carnegie Mellon. A recently 
published pamphlet written by local 
peace activists asserts that the SEI is 
working on projects that are directly tied 
to specific defense systems and weapons. 
In particular, the pamphlet states that 
the SEI is participating in the develop
ment of the following systems and weap
ons:
 the F-16 fighter
0 warning systems for the U.S. Space 
Command at Cheyenne Mountain, 
Colorado
 the B-1B bomber
 an inertial guidance system for Navy 
ships that provides critical informa
tion to onboard fire control systems
 the Advanced Tactical Fighter
 the Lockheed C-141 StarLifter air 
craft
 the Autonomous Land Vehicle
 tactical land-air missiles
 the Strategic Defense System (a.k.a. 
Star Wars)
At a public lecture on Monday, Novem
ber 7th, Provost Angel Jordan stated 
that, in substance, the information con
tained in the pamphlet is correct. How
ever, when CMU administrators first 
announced that Carnegie Mellon had 
won the contract to manage the SEI, 
they insisted that SEI activities would 
not focus on projects directly associated 
with the specific defense systems or 
weapons. More recently, Larry Druffel, 
Director of the SEI, has stated that the 
Software Engineering Institute is not 
involved in weapon systems. [Focus, 
Vol. 16, No. 2 (October 1986)]. It cer
tainly appears that CMUs administra
tion has been misleading the rest of the 
Carnegie Mellon community. We call 
upon the Provost to explain the inconsis
tency between the information in the 
recently published pamphlet and the 
administrations assurances that the SEI 
does not work on specific weapon sys
tems.
The existence of potential nonmilitary 
applications for the technology and proc
esses developed at the SEI does not elimi
nate the moral problems associated with 
its weapons-related activities. Given 
present foreign and defense policies, 
there is a distinct and disturbing possi
bility that weapons the SEI is helping to 
develop will be used in the commission of. 
criminal acts. Should this possibility 
come to pass, Carnegie Mellon will bear 
some responsibility for those crimes. 
Furthermore, insofar as the SEI is help
ing to develop ever more sophisticated 
weapon systems, it is unquestionably 
playing a role in an arms race that threat
ens world stability and syphons off funds 
that could be used to generate socially 
valuable products and services.
In light of the questionable moral status 
of the SEI, we believe that it was irre
sponsible of Carnegie Mellons admini
stration to actively pursue the contract 
to manage it (as Provost Jordan pointed 
out in his talk last Monday, the admini
stration went as far as lobbying mem
bers of Congress in order to secure the 
contract for CMU). Further, by failing to 
engage in public deliberations about the 
ethics of managing the SEI  a facility 
that is chartered to participate in weap
ons development  before soliciting the 
lucrative management contract, the 
administration demonstrated great in
sensitivity to moral questions.
We call upon the administration to 
stop the SEI from working on weapons 
and defense systems. We do not propose 
that the University prohibit its faculty 
from receiving Defense Department 
research funds. However, we know that 
many faculty members would prefer to 
get their research money from other, less 
morally controversial sources (e.g. the 
National Science Foundation). At his 
talk, Provost Jordan expressed his own 
preference for less Department of De
fense (DoD) involvement in the financ
ing of university research and develop
ment (R&D). We are sure that other 
university administrators here and else
where feel as he does. We therefore urge
him and others like him to use thei 
influence, both individually and coll 
tively, to make an active, public effort t 
convince the government to transfer 
large percentage of the DoDs researc 
budget to nonmilitary agencies.
Mary Shaw, Chief Scientist at the SE 
has criticized the intellectual quality 
discussions at the university about mil 
tary and proprietary R&D. We agrf 
with this criticism. The administratio 
could promote better communicatio 
about these matters if it provided tt 
CMU community with relevant inform! 
tion about ongoing R&D. We call upo 
the administration to make the follov 
ing information readily available:
1. All contracts for federally-funded; 
R&D projects currently being car
ried out at CMU.
2. The amount of CMUs annual re
search funding that comes from eac 
of the following sources:
a. Department of Defense
b. Department of Energy
c. NASA
d. National Science Foundatio
e. National Institutes of Healt
f. National Endowment for th 
Humanities
g. Department of Education
h. National Peace Institute
i. private non-profit organize 
tions
j. private for-profit organizatioi
3. The amount of proprietary and clas 
ified R&D conducted at CMU.
4. The current civilian applications 
the SEIs work on software engi
neering.
5. The intended military applicatioi
of the SEIs work.
We recommend that items 2-5 be pu 
lished in an annual report to the comm 
nity.

Anxiety attacks in Wean Hall: 15-lxx raises stress levels
15-111, 15-116, 15-118. These 
umbers strike dread into the 
hearts of Carnegie Mellon stu
dents. With the possible excep
tion of 17,000 and <2.0, these are 
a students least favorite numer
als. They conjure up images of 5 
am stays in a room with concrete 
block walls, tutors who dont speak 
gnglish, software that crashes 
just before you save thsCt block of 
code that its taken you an hour to 
igure out, and grades that drop 
four QPA into the dreaded <2.0 
zone. I think most people would 
ie that 15-lxx generates more 
anxiety than any other course.
Anxiety is a bad thing, and 
theres enough of it here at CMU. 
While there was only one suicide 
iere last year (and a murder the 
-ear before, remember) there have 
jeen at least seven suicide at:empts that I am personally aware 
 Anxiety plays a big factor in 
hese. It is anxiety that has CMU 
students as both inand out-pa;ients at Western Psychiatric 
Institute (and thats a real men
ial hospital, not a just visiting 
:linic). It is excessive anxiety that 
s responsible for the real drinkng problem this university has. 
Its anxiety that fills up the offices 
of local psychiatrists (psychia60 Coarse 
Michael D.C. Drout
trists are M.D.s who dont deal 
with big time mental problems) 
and psychologists. Anyone who 
tells you that there isnt an anxi
ety problem at CMU is selling 
something (like maybe a CMU 
education, just a little over 60K 
or so, a real bargain...).
So why do we have a course that 
seems tailor-made to increase 
anxiety? Just look at the way 15- 
lxx is set up. First, lets use Beta 
test software. What a bright idea. 
Lets test experimental software 
on frightened and anxious stu
dents, many of whom have never 
used a computer before. Lets 
pump a few nice shots of adrenal
ine through their veins whenever 
the system crashes through no 
fault of their own. Sure, thatll 
help reduce anxiety.
Lets have the lecturer for 15- 
118, on the first day of the course, 
discuss how many students failed 
the course the semester before, 
how hard the course is, and re
peatedly emphasize that the 
course must be passed in order to 
graduate. Theres a line between
motivation and terrorization and 
it seems obvious which side these 
remarks were on. (Im not criti
cizing Jim Roberts himself, just 
his opening remarks my fresh
man year. One-on-one Jim ex
plains and helps debug PASCAL 
code better than anyone, and his 
manner is soothing without being 
condescending.)
Lets put in some nice, timeconsuming projects so that stu
dents can experience the joys of 
debugging code. Why are these 
project necessary? If the purpose 
of the course is to teach problemsolvingrather than PASCAL code, 
why do student have to learn and 
debug such large programs? I 
dont see the point.
And lets design the course so 
that a students performance on 
one five-hour exam counts for 
fifty-one percent of their semes
ter grade. Well let an entire se
mester ride on this one exam. A 
Mastery. What a great way to 
reduce anxiety. The course is 
supposed to teach problem solv
ing, so well test to see if the stu
dent can solve problems by giving 
them a huge exam that theyve 
already seen before. An exam that 
tests their mastery of code. I dont 
know about you, but I was given
the code for an alphabetic sort in 
15-118.1 didnt have to solve any 
problems, I just plugged it in.
This is ancillary to the fact that 
the grade on this exam is really 
meaningless. I know several stu
dents who really knew and know 
nothing about PASCAL but who 
got As on the mastery. They 
simply memorized the code. One 
friend (who received a 4.0 for the 
semester, so shes no dummy) lit
erally memorized all five master
ies. This wastes the precious re
source of time, ___________________
and if 4.0 stu
dents feel it is 
necessary to 
memorize the 
code instead of 
being suffi
ciently confi
dent to try to 
solve the prob
lems on the
exam, some___________________
thing is wrong.
Finally, we can raise the anxi
ety level even further by not al
lowing students to turn in assign
ments late for a reduced grade 
and by not having enough tutors 
to assist the students. While many 
of the tutors are very good, there 
are a large percentage who either
15-111, 15-116, 
15-118. These num
bers strike dread 
into the hearts of 
Carnegie Mellon 
students
dont speak English very well or 
who simply never get to a students 
desk when asked for help. 
Whether this is a function of there 
not being enough tutors or of 
tutors being poorly trained, I dont 
know. Regardless of the reason, 
the problem is there and it con
tributes to the anxiety problem.
A decision should be made as to 
the true purpose of 15-lxx. Is it to 
teach problem solving? If so, there 
has been some slippage in recent 
years. Even if the course teaches 
___________________ problem solv
ing, it doesnt 
grade based on 
the students 
knowledge of 
these tech
niques (except 
possibly 
obliquely). Is 
the purpose of 
__________________the course to
____________________ teach PASCAL^
code? I would 
seriously question the wisdom of 
forcing humanities and art ma
jors to take a course the purpose 
of which is to learn code. Im all 
for broad-based knowledge, but 
that seems a little ridiculous.
The course could probably be 
fixed by shortening the programs,
reducing the amount of code that 
has to be learned, eliminating the 
mastery, and re-emphasizing the 
problem-solving skills over the 
actual programming. When I took 
the course my freshman year, the 
problem-solving aspects were 
given consideration and gone over 
in recitation. Last spring they 
were not. Grading students based 
on the problem-solving ability 
rather than their knowledge of 
PASCAL code will go a long way 
towards fixing 15-lxx.
The present course design does 
nothing to lessen the anxiety 
associated with computers; for 
many students, anxiety is raised 
to ridiculous levels. It seems like 
the course is either a sop to the 
CompSci department, or just 
another example of a course that 
has gotten away from its original 
purpose of teaching a problem 
solving method. Whatever the 
case, 15-lxx is a poorly designed 
course that creates problems that 
far outweigh any of its question
able benefits.

Reagan dealt with Iran to hold hostages until after the Elections
Following is the second in a 
'wo-part series by English ProfesJim Kavanagh  Ed.
Lets move on to the evidence of 
:ontacts with Iran regarding the 
lostages. The Iranians, rememjer, hated Carter, who harbored 
;he Shah. In the Spring of 1980, a 
laturalized American citizen bom 
Iran approached the independnt campaign of John Anderson, 
laiming to have been authorized 
>y the Iranian President to pur
sue negotiations on an arms-forlostages deal. According to a 
awyer with the Anderson cam)aign, this intermediary was 
idamant about one condition: that 
credit must not go to Carter. 
The Anderson people dutifully 
eferred this person to the State 
)epartment, Carter rejected the 
rms of an arms-for-hostages 
irade, and the contact broke off. 
By September 1980, at war with 
[raq, Iran was getting more desjerate for American military 
supplies. That month, Richard 
Ulen of the October Surprise
Jim Kavanagh
group was contacted by Robert 
McFarlane (also to become Na
tional Security Advisor and promi
nent in the Iran-Contra scandal), 
who claimed to know, and em
phatically suggested meeting 
with, a representative of the Ira
nian government eager to deal for 
the hostages. In October 1980, 
McFarlane, Allen, and Laurence 
Silberman (of the Reagan-Bush 
foreign policy group) actually did 
meet with this intermediary at 
the LEnfant Plaza Hotel in 
Washington. Silberman claims 
that when this envoy suggested a 
deal releasing the hostages to the 
Reagan campaign, he was imme
diately cut off, and told to go 
through official channels. All the 
Reaganites, according to Silber
man, acted with scrupulous pro
priety.
Their scrupulousness did not 
extend, however, to notifying the
United States government of this 
overture (as the Anderson cam
paign had done), nor even to 
asking this gentleman his name. 
It seems that none of these scru
pulous men bothered to check with 
their extensive sources about this 
contact McFarlane was so em
phatic about, and not one, for the 
life of him, can recall the mans 
name. Richard Allen has  guess 
what?mislaid his notes of the 
meeting.
Abdolhassan Bani-Sadr, who 
was President of Iran at the time 
and is now in exile in France, 
reconstructs this situation differ
ently. He claims the envoy was 
sent by Ayatollah Rafsanjani, was 
received positively by Allen, 
McFarlane, and Silberman, and 
met with other senior Reagan 
advisors before returning to Iran. 
According to Bani-Sadr: They 
agreed in principle that the hos
tages would be liberated after the 
election, and that, if elected, 
Reagan would provide more arms 
than Carter was offering. To
cement the deal, a final meeting 
was held during the last two weeks 
in October at the Hotel Raphael 
in Paris, attended by some nowfamiliar names: the Ayatollahs 
Rafsanjani and Beheshti; arms 
merchants Cyrus Hashemi, 
Manucher Ghorbanifar, and Al
bert Hakim; and representing the 
highest echelons of the Reagan 
campaign, the vice-presidential 
candidate, George Bush. The fi
nal deal was that the hostages 
would be held until Inauguration 
Day, in return for delivery of 
American military supplies 
through third parties  inde
pendent arms merchants, friendly 
foreign governments. Bani-Sadr 
claims to have documentary evi
dence of this deal, but has not 
produced it.
The bulk of Bani-Sadrs story is 
supported by one Mansur 
Rafizadeh, a former Savak chief 
connected to the CIA. He also 
describes an October meeting in 
Paris, though he identifies Donald 
Gregg (Bushs National Security
of the hostages, increasingly fran
tic to strike a quick deal with 
Carter lest Iran be faced with 
worse prospects from the toughtalking Reagan. In October, at a 
meeting of the Iranian Supreme 
Defense Council attended by 
Farhang, this worry was suddenly 
replaced by indifference; the same
people who, a month earlier, had 
been concerned to get rid of the 
hostages quickly, now seemed 
totally unconcerned. This change 
in attitude went all the way to the 
top; according to Farhang: In

we had our headquarters say they

Dan Quayle: clearinghouse for Reaganism
Last week I was sitting at home 
watching the election returns 
when the phone rang. It was my 
friend Art Buchwaid.
I cant talk over the phone, he 
said. Meet me at the Smithsonian 
in half an hour.
I jumped into my car, wonder
ing what was up. I was a few 
minutes late when I met Art in 
the lobby of the Smithsonian.
We walked through the mu
seum as we talked. Have I got a 
story for you about Ronald Rea
gan, he whispered.
He stopped in front of an ex
hibit on the human brain. He 
turned to me and asked, Remem
ber when Reagan had prostate 
surgery?
Sure, I said. It was during 
the Iran-contra scandal. I re
membered the detailed diagrams 
I saw on NBCs evening news. 
Well, Art said, he had more
Eric W. Leuliette
than just his prostate removed. 
They took out his brain, too. He 
tapped the case of the exhibit.
Youve got to be kidding, I 
said emphatically.
No, replied Art. It was Don 
Regans idea. He wanted to make 
sure Reagan didnt remember a 
thing about Ollie North or plane 
loads of anti-tank weapons. 
But then, wheres Reagans 
brain now?
Well, the White House staff 
decided it would be best to trans
plant it into a youthful, telegenic 
body.
You dont mean 
Yes, said Art coldly, glancing 
over his shoulder. Dan Quayle 
has Reagans brain. Didnt you
wonder why Bush picked a sena
tor no one had ever heard of when 
he had the finest of the Republi
can Party to chose from?
My God! I exclaimed as it 
suddenly sunk in. That explains 
all of the coincidences between 
Quayle and Reaganthe factual 
errors, the anecdotal version of 
American history, the right-wing 
anti-communism, the need to 
isolate him from reporters... 
Exactly. The Bush people have 
kept him away from reporters in 
case he starts talking about old 
movies and gives himself away. 
Hes already been asking to go 
horseback riding, and last week 
his handlers had to stop him be
fore he phoned Jimmy Stewart to 
talk about winning the election. 
Does Bush know about the 
transplant?
Yeah, he went along with it. 
He thought that if Reagan had a
body which resembled Robert 
Redford, hed go back into act
ing.
It really explained a lot about 
what was going on in politics, but
I had two nagging questions. As 
we walked onto Constitution 
Street, I asked, Will he be happy 
as V.P.?
Yeah, the plan now is for 
George to get his eight years as 
Chief and then Reagan, er, Quayle 
gets to move back into 1600 Penn
sylvania Avenue. It gets him 
around the 22nd amendment. 
Well, if this is all true, Art, 
whos running Reagans body?

doing that for years.

riners. What do some real Amurricins have to say? One, Barbara 
Honegger, a Reagan-Bush cam
paign staffer in 1980 and later a 
policy analyst in the White House, 
claims she was in Reagan cam
paign headquarters on 24 or 25 
October 1980, when an excited 
member of the operations cen
ter staff blurted out: We dont 
have to worry about an October 
Surprise. Dick [presumably Rich
ard Allen] cut a deal. In a radio 
interview, Honegger has also al
leged that Bush was at a Paris 
meeting with Iranian officials in 
October 1980.
One intriguing remark of --------
Ronald Reagan himself was 
recounted by none other 
than Richard Allen, during 
an interview on MacNeil/ 
Lehrer in 1986. According 
to Allen, the day after 
Reagans inauguration (and 
the simultaneous release of 
the American hostages),
Allen told Reagan about a 
fifty-third hostage, Cyn
thia Dwyer, who had been 
captured separately and not 
returned with the main 
group. Hearing this, Re
agan told Allen that if 
Dwyer was not released, he 
should: Get the word out 
that the deals off. Really?
What deal?
Jimmy Carter says: We 
have had reports since late 
summer 1980 about Reagan 
campaign officials dealing with 
Iranians concerning delayed re
lease of the American hostages. I 
chose to ignore the reports. He 
has added: There were reports 
made to me before the election 
that this was going on  that the 
hostages would not be released 
and that weapons sales would be 
restored to Iran, either directly or 
through the Israelis. He also 
described the timing of the hos
tage release as odd, since they 
were in an airplane, ready to take 
off from Teheran airport at 10 
oclock on the morning of the 
inauguration, but were held until 
twelve noon exactly  until, that 
is, he and Ronald Reagan were on 
the inaugural stand.
More recently, during a Fed
eral trial in Denver on September 
23, 1988, there occurred, under 
oath, the following exchange be
tween Assistant US Attorney 
Thomas ORourke and a witness 
named Richard Brenneke, a pro
fessional arms dealer and CIA 
consultant:
ORourke: The gist of your tes
timony about the several meet
ings  three meetings in Octo
ber, in Paris, was  is that the 
Reagan campaign was attempt
ing, unofficially, to negotiate the 
release of the American hostages 
in Iran. Is that right?
Isn't it nice to live in 
an open democracy; 
where a contestatory 
political process and a 
free, independent 
press ensure a fullyinformed citizenry?
Or is it a carefullymanaged electoral 
theater....
Brenneke: Thats correct.
ORourke: And that they were 
also attempting to delay the re
lease of those hostages until after 
the Presidential elections of 1980; 
is that what you are saying?
Brenneke: Yes, sir, thats cor
rect.
ORourke: Do you know that 
because you were involved in the 
meetings, at which those matters 
were discussed?
Brenneke: Yes, sir.
Of course, there could be an 
innocent explanation for all this. 
(And theres a nice bridge for sale.) 
Nobody is likely to fess up. But we 
wouldnt have known about 
Donna Rice and the Monkey Busi
ness if the press hadnt camped 
outside Gary Harts bedroom
window and hounded him ruth
lessly with questions. It is truly 
amazing  not to say disgraceful
 that what we have seen and 
heard about all this in the main
stream media is nada, niente, zip. 
Silence reigns, even after the 
recent release of one Beirut hos
tage gave the press an excuse to 
re-open the question.
Imagine if all this evidence 
pointed to a deal by some liberal 
candidate to persuade some dirty 
Commies to keep American hos
tages? Imagine if there were all 
this evidence indicatingthat some 
major political candidate was a 
------- homosexual? Isnt the ques
tion: Did you make or at
tempt to make a deal to 
have Americans held hos
tage longer? at least as 
relevant as Have you ever 
committed adultery? And 
dont think the press is 
unaware of the evidence. I 
know about it, and the edi
tors and reporters of every 
major media outlet know 
about it. The senior execu
tives of the mainstream 
press have simply made a 
deliberate decision not to 
mention it  in effect, to 
hide it from most of the 
American people.
We do know, however, 
that the hostages were held 
at the Teheran airport for 
no apparent reason until 
noon of Inauguration Day. We 
know that the first shipments of 
American arms to Iran, through 
Israel, took place in February
1981, one month after Reagans 
inauguration, and continued until 
the famous Iran-Contra revela
tions, until the Iranians received 
virtually all of the arms that 
Carter had not wanted to give 
them. Indeed, what about the 
famous Iran-Contra investigation 
itself. Didnt it go over all this 
ground? No. Why? Because Ed
win Meese, at a press conference 
in November 1986, volunteered 
information to the national press 
about the diversion of profits from 
arms sales to the contras. As a 
result, the Congressional commit
tee restricted its investigation to
the period from 1984 on, when 
the Boland amendments were in 
effect, and the Iran-Contra rela
tionship was the paramount ques
tion.
Ill bet many stubbornly naive 
Americans thought that Meese 
revealed the politically damaging 
information about the Contra 
enterprise because he was moti
vated by an overwhelming instinct 
for honesty and civic responsibil
ity. Ill bet very few were cynical 
enough immediately to suspect 
that Meese was trying to hide 
something else  something po
tentially more damaging  by 
revealing what he did about the 
contra enterprise. What could 
possibly have been more damag
ing to the Reaganite forces than 
the Iran-Contra investigation, 
which indeed dealt a severe blow 
to the administrations military 
strategy in Nicaragua? Worth a 
thought. After all, Oliver North is 
still a hero to conservatives, and 
George Bush seems a shoo-in. One 
cant imagine there would be much 
of a mass base left for the ReaganBush agenda if a thorough inves
tigation of the original secret 
team activities, those regarding 
the Iran-hostage situation, had 
led to confirmation of any of the 
evidence given above.
Isnt it nice to live in an open 
democracy, where a contestatory 
political process, and a free, inde
pendent press ensure a fully-informed citizenry? Or is it a care
fully-managed electoral theater, 
in which the major political par
ties and media institutions col
lude to restrict peoples knowl
edge of the real forces that are at 
work in society?
But, hey, theres always hope. 
Maybe, after the elections, the 
press will get some courage, 
Congress will get some spine, 
therell be a massive investiga
tion, the truth will come out, and 
the system will be vindicated. The 
President is impeached! Longlive 
the President!  President 
Quayle.

Its over, finally over. After 
two years, hundreds of debates 
and sound bites, we ended up 
electing George Bush as Presi
dent. Kind of anticlimactic, isnt 
it?
The election seemed to drag 
on. Only in America can a per
son run for office for the same 
amount of time that s/he holds 
that office. In Canada, the elec
tion lasts only four weeks and 
they havent seemed to have too 
many problems figuring who to 
elect. Of course, whens the last 
time their choice meant all that 
much in the grand scheme of 
things.
The length of the campaign 
wouldnt have been so bad if the 
interesting candidates hadnt 
dropped out so early. I dont 
think anyone in their right mind 
would have voted for Pat 
Robertson, but he said the 
damnedest things. Pat, you stiB 
havent told us where the hos
tages in Lebanon are.
The man we all loved to hate 
faded away too. After Atlanta, 
not one peep was heard from 
Jesse Jackson. Obviously, he 
was showing his anger over the 
Bentsen choice.
Other candidates never had a 
chance. Gary Hart liked to fool 
around with pretty women. Joe 
Biden plagiarized. Does this 
mean that no one at Carnegie 
Mellon can ever run for Presi
dent?
The American public holds its 
candidates for high office to 
higher standards than it holds 
for itself. That is, for the one 
thing we dont tolerate from our
selves, but expect from politi
cians -lying.
Did any of them think we be
lieved them? Especially when 
they dropped out of the race and 
suddenly turned into Bush or 
Dukakis supporters, as if they
Inquiring Minds 
Stew Levine
had now seen the light. The 
most honest thing anyone had 
said was by Bruce Babbitt after 
he dropped out. He said that 
the highlight of his campaign 
had been his appearance on 
Saturday Night Live.
Maybe if someone better had 
run. Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, 
Mario Cuomo, Paul Laxalt, and 
several others stayed out of the 
race. Sadly, in the end the only 
candidate worth voting for was 
Jack Tanner and you could only 
vote for him if you had HBO.
We get another chance in 1992 
if we want to avoid a repeat of 
this election. Maybe we should 
try a few new things.
We could hold a draft in Janu
ary 92. Just like pro football, 
allow each state draft a pre
ferred candidate and let them 
fight it out for the nominations. 
That way when Cuomo says he 
wont run again, he wont have 
a chance; ditto for Gary Hart 
when he says he will run again.
Change debates back to the 
way they were in the time of 
Lincoln. No more questions 
about wives being raped; let the 
candidates tear into each other 
for a couple of hours.
Dont allow Iowa and New 
Hampshire to hold primaries or 
caucuses first. Do we really 
want a bunch of pig farmers 
narrowing down the field for 
us?
Probably none of these 
changes will happen. That 
leaves us with one final chance. 
Lets not watch TV for a year, 
and,, who knows, maybe the 
whole thing will just go away by 
itself.
Which George Bush did we end up with?
Its finally over. The American 
people have chosen George Bush 
over Michael Dukakis. While we 
know that George Bush will be 
our next president, there is still a 
mystery concerning exactly what 
a George Bush presidency will be 
like. Does George Bush have a 
mandate from the people? Did 
the American people chose George 
Bush, the product, or George 
Bush, the package?
.If a mandate mustbe proclaimed 
before the election, then the 
George Bush mandate must start 
with the trite. He will work against 
furlough programs for first de
gree murders, for requiring school 
teachers to say the pledge of alle
giance and, best of all, he will 
have to clean Boston Harbor. The 
other pieces of the mandate are 
littered with abstract sound bites: 
flexible freeze, kinder, gentler 
nation, a thousand points of 
light. This is not a mandate from 
the people. This is the George 
Bush package.
George Bush, the product, is 
much harder to pin down. Is 
George Bush the moderate who 
ran for President in 1980? Is 
George Bush going to make radi
cal right-wing judicial appoint
ments? Will he go belly-up to the 
New Right or will he make them 
cringe?
Even the Democratic Congress 
has agreed that George Bush will 
probably have the traditional 
honeymoon period that most 
new Presidents have. This does 
not mean they will blindly pass 
through legislation which they 
find wrong. What it means is that 
they will take an open-minded 
look at the new policies proposed 
by the Bush White House. He will 
have an open door to the Congress 
to introduce new approaches to 
the problems facing our country.
If the Bush/Quayle administra
tion really stands behind the 
kinder, gentler nation idea, it
Chuck Jainchill
willmean a reversal from the 
Reagan/Bush administration. It 
means a serious look at child care, 
the homeless and the working 
poor. These are all issues that 
have become more serious in the 
last eight years. These are issues 
that the Reagan administration 
has unfortunately ignored.
On foreign policy, a kinder, 
gentler nation will hopefully look 
at the problems abroad in terms 
of human rights and not as a 
blind fight against the word Com
munism. This means a critical 
look at our allies in South Africa 
and Central America who have 
been abusing the human rights of 
the people in their respective 
countries and regions.
Lastly it is worth looking at the 
deficit under the eminent Bush 
administration. So far we have 
heard flexible freeze and no 
new taxes. Sound bites dont 
balance budgets. A flexible 
freeze, as I understand it, will 
basically freeze the budget with 
minor adjustments up or down in 
some areas. By George Bush 
committing himself to every ma
jor weapon system proposed under 
Ronald Reagan he will need to 
raise the defense budget several 
percentage points above inflation 
each year. This means serious 
cuts in social and entitlement pro
grams, serious cuts to a kinder, 
gentler nation.
With his no new taxes pledge, 
George Bush has taken a step 
beyond the Reagan administra
tion. In recent years, while not 
raising income tax, the govern
ment has raised taxes through 
what have been called user fees. If 
George Bush is true to his prom
ise against any new taxes of any 
type, a balanced budget seems to
be beyond the scope of the next 
administration.
It is obvious that most of the 
above statements have been 
speculation based on the themes 
of the recent Presidential cam
paign. All that is left for us to do 
now is watch and wait. Starting 
on January 20,1989, we will have
at least four years to observe our 
new president in action. We will 
soon see which George Bush we 
have elected.

 A crowd of over three hundred 
people filled Skibo Ballroom for 
Saturday nights Airband compe? tition. Presented by Activities 
Board Entertainment Spotlight,
| Airband proved to be an extremely 
successful event. It was organ
ized by Spotlight Chairman Gina 
Marsala, who seemed pleased 
with the turnout. Airband is one 
of the best comic events at CMU 
each year.
j This years show was hosted by 
comedian Ron Daran. Daran is 
|a two time Star Search winner 
and is featured in the upcoming 
motion picture Bum Rap. The 
topics of his routine ranged from 
second grade personal recollec
tions to Star Trek imitations to 
advice on the practices of safe sex.
; The participants showed both 
talent and guts. The first band 
was Dion and the Belmonts, swaying to the rhythm of I Wonder 
\Why. Pam Lundquist danced and 
sang with her interpretation of 
Sinead OConnors Just Like U 
|Said it Would B. Air Force ROTC 
brought out their best as the wellchoreographed Del Vikings 
singing Come Go With Me. Mem
bers of Delta Upsilon rocked as 
Billy Idol and band singing Danc
ing With Myself. Delta Upsilon 
members also performed Jingle 
jBells and Here Comes Santa Claus 
as Bing Crosby and the Andrew 
Sisters for a very enthusiastic 
audience. The sixth and final 
performance was by members of 
Alpha Tau Omega, in full make
up and costume, as Kiss singing/ 
Want to Rock and Roll All Night.
The performances were judged

They were Oren Adar, President

The final play to be produced in 
this years Junior Rep season will 
be Georg Buchners Woyzeck. 
Although it was written in 1837, 
the play is modern in its style and 
realism.
Director David Korish is excited 
about the plays modern style and 
subject. It was 150 years ahead 
of its time. Its extremely engag
ing materiala great play. In 
contrast to other works of the 
same period Woyzeck is composed 
of a series of short, intense scenes. 
It is simple, realistic, and power
ful.
Unlike the accepted plays of its 
time, which used the lower classes 
as comic relief, Woyzeck was the 
first working-class tragedy. The 
play centers around a poor Ger
man soldier who kills his lover in 
a jealous rage, but this rather
clich story line hardly hints at! 
the plays philosophical depth. In! 
his introduction to the play, Vic-! 
tor Price writes, Woyzeck is a! 
man beaten and badgered almost; 
out of his senses by life... He has; 
a pathetic longing to understand; 
life, but is not equipped to do so.;. 
These concerns are certainly more! 
real and pressing to a modern! 
audience than those of the more! 
genteel tragedies of Biichners; 
time, which centered around some; 
middle or upper class characters; 
entrapment in social circum-; 
stance. Like the plays which were; 
to come many years later, Woyzeck I 
examines the deeper philosophi
cal tragedy of all people, even the. 
lower classes.

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  15 November 1988
Five outstanding performances...
Classical music is addictive
This week Pittsburgh offered 
the classical music lover the op
portunity to overdose on high 
quality musical events. After 
j going through withdrawal symp! toms the previous week (for lack 
! of time), I found myself into a 
' heavy addiction by the end of the 
 week. It all started at last 
; Sundays Pittsburgh Symphony 
program, conducted by Jerzy 
Semkow and with Rudolf 
: Firkusny as piano soloist.
The aging pianist is, sadly,
; losing some of his technical 
j flair, but hearing the beauj tiful tone quality he pro; duced, especially in the slow 
; middle movement of the 
; Mozart D minor Concerto 
\ was worth the entire price of the 
! ticket. Semkows interpretation 
of the Schubert Symphony No. 9 
-was conservative in approach but 
'"certainly achieved great clarity of 
sound in sharp contrast to some 
overblown interpretations of the 
work that I have heard.
The Pittsburgh Chamber Mu
sic Society presented the Los 
Angeles Piano Quartet in an ex
cellent concert at Carnegie Music 
Hall in Oakland. The opening 
work, a Mozart duo for violin and 
viola, was most interesting in its 
final movement, where the play
ers injected the music with a nice 
element of sparkle to bringit alive. 
Perhaps the best playing in the 
concert, though, was in the Ger
ard Schurman Quartet fo Piano 
and Strings, a work written for 
the L.A. Quartet in 1986. The 
third movement, a slow Corale, 
was very moving emotionally and 
dramatically. The Dvorak Piano 
Quartet in E flat constituted the 
second half of the program. It was 
the first time I had heard this 
work and despite the brittle open
ing, the Quartets performance 
was still convincing. The audi
ence seemed to enjoy this work 
the most, and as a sign of the in
volvement in the concert, they 
"heaved a collective sigh of ap
proval after the next to lastmove""ment. For an encore the group 
: offered a wonderful performance 
of the Scherzo from the Faure G 
minor Quartet.
My favorite performance of the 
 five events I attended this past 
 week (I told you I O.D.d!) was the 
' -Pittsburgh Opera presentation of 
"Richard Strauss Salome. Stephanie Sundine in the title role was 
as beautiful in voice as she was in 
appearance and was utterly con
vincing in her manipulative char
acter. In the Dance of the Seven 
Veils (a strip-tease in an opera!?) 
a stand-in is often used, but in 
this production Sundine per
formed the twelve minute dance 
herself, and extremely sensually, 
I might add! The rest of the cast 
was brilliant as well, from Ragnar Ulflungs slimy Herod to 
Beverly Evans as his bitchy wife 
Herodias, down through to all the 
smaller roles of the soldiers and 
the nervous Jewish elders. One 
cannot forget, especially, John 
Brochheler in the role of John the 
Baptist, exhibiting a gorgeous 
baritone voice until Salome had 
his head cut off. Also impressive 
was the playing of the Benedum 
Center Orchestra, doing a very 
respectable job on this extremely 
difficult score. If only the conduc
tor had done a better job at con
necting musical lines...
The only real disappointment 
of the week was the Y Music 
Society recital of PSO concertmaster Andres Cardenes. The 
violinist and his accompanist 
Katherine Collier played a tech
nically amazing concert, but 
musically the event was anything 
but interesting. Cardenes pyrotechnical abilities quickly became 
frustrating in that there was no 
music to back them up. In each of 
the four works both performers 
ignored the dramatic importance 
of the written silences and failed 
also to give enough dynamic con
trast. I do not question the per
formers musicality, but they 
failed to demonstrate it with their 
playing, which in its metronomic 
overperfection failed to take the 
same breaths the composers 
breathed as they wrote their 
music.
Unquestionably, the most im
portant musical event in Pitts
burgh this week was the series of 
concerts Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday evenings. These con
certs marked LorinMaazels first
appearance with the PSO as its 
Music Director. A less than soldout audience Thursday was a 
great shock to me considering the 
significance of Maazels new post 
in the Pittsburgh classical music 
scene. The performance, however, 
showed the orchestra at a level of 
outstanding performance that has 
not been seen since Charles 
Dutoits opening concert this year. 
Maazel achieves a rich, full sound 
from this orchestra which 
plays as if the devil him
self was on the podium. 
Could it be that the play
ers are scared to play for a 
conductor that can hear 
what every instrument is 
doing simultaneously? 
Cellist Lynn Harrell and PSO 
violist Randolf Kelly played with 
lots of character in the roles of 
Don Quixote and his side-kick 
Sancho Panza in this musical 
painting of the Cervantes novel. 
Those in the audience who had 
not read the program notes for 
the piece might have complained 
of a lack of coherance, but the 
problem was in the episodic na
ture of the music, not in Maazels 
talented storytelling/conducting. 
The Sinfonia Domestica, a musi
cal portrait of a day in the life of 
the Strauss family, is a more 
coherent piece by nature and 
seemed to hold the audiences 
attention better than the first 
work. The huge orchestras play
ing (Strauss asks for an ensemble 
exceeding 100 musicians) made 
the work a probable highlight of 
the season. My only complaint 
with this concert was the sched
uling of two large lesser-known 
works of Strauss. I question 
whether this was the best choice 
for Maazels debut, for this kind 
of program requires so much au
dience concentration that many 
concertgoers interest seemed to 
lag. In any case, this weekend 
certainly signals the beginning of 
a new era for the Pittsburgh 
Symphony.
Next week at the Symphony, 
Lorin Maazel conducts the 
Brahms German Requiem with 
Pamela Coburn, soprano, Ludwig 
Bauman, baritone, and the Men
delssohn Choir of Pittsburgh.-Performances Friday at 8:30, Satur

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  15 November 198813
graffiti hosts Stanley Jordan
By STEWART LEVINE
 Tartan Contributing Editor
.Guitar virtuoso Stanley Jordan returns 
: to Pittsburgh this weekend for two con! certs in support of his new album.
-The 28-year-old musician has been 
' turning heads since his discovery at 
' New Yorks 1984 Kool Jazz Festival, and 
last appeared in Pittsburgh in 1987 at 
; the Mellon Jazz Festival as well in a 
; CMU Activities Board-sponsored con; cert at Carnegie Music Hall. In his ap! pearance at the Kool Jazz Festival at
 Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center,
' Jordan performed the incredible task of 
: upstaging trumpeter Wynton Marsalis 
; in concert. This achievement is made 
; niore impressive by the fact that Jordan 
; was not even listed on the program.
Jordans unique sound comes from the 
touch technique which has earned him 
his reputation. The technique, also
known as two-handed tapping, allows 
him to play two melody lines at once. His 
mastery of this method led to this warn
ing on his second album: Do not be de
ceived, despite what your ears may be 
telling you, there is only one guitar on 
this album. There are no overdubs.
His previous two albums Magic Touch 
and Standards, Volume 1 have appeared 
on Capitols jazz Blue Note label, and 
have featured Jordan as a soloist. His 
new album has been released on com
panion label EMI-Manhattan, in part to 
expose Jordan to a wider audience. It 
also shows off Jordan with accompani
ment, opening his sound up further.
The two concerts, in keeping with the 
new album, will feature Jordan with a 
band, unlike his previous solo efforts.
Stanley Jordan will be at Graffiti this 
Friday to perform two shows, at 7:30 pm 
and 10:45 pm. For ticket information call 
682-4210.
Gov. Issue plays emo-core
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
Government Issue, one of the next 
big things that has been up and com
ing for over seven years and 
almost as many albums, is com
ing to town.
Starting out as another one of 
those D.C. punk bands, Govern
ment Issue has moved along the 
same path as Hiisker Dii and 
Naked Raygun, taking the power 
pop concept to a new extreme. 
Their next-to-latest LP, You, is 
all about love, not a terribly popular 
topic for most punk tunes. (In the world 
of quick punk labels, G.I. is known as 
emo-core. Nobody is exactly sure 
what it means, but it looks kinda nice.) 
The rock and roll purists are happy 
because the tunes still have a big gui
tar roar, the intelligentsia are happy 
because G.I. isnt singing add another 
notch to my crotch anymore, and the 
little skinhead kids are happy because 
they can still slam, even if the band
Music Music Music 
In 
Review
doesnt like it.
Anyway, theyve got a new album out 
called Crash (ten twisted love songs, 
hoo boy!) that sounds more like You than 
any other album, and theyll be at the 
Electric Banana this Thursday. The 
shows probably going to be kind of ex
pensive - the Banana tends towards 
high cover charges - but it should be 
worth it, especially since local legends 
Half Life are opening. Its all ages, it 
should start somewhere around eight 
(but dont bet on it), and there will 
almost definitely be a pit, so be 
prepared. The Electric Banana is 
located at 3887 Bigelow Boule
vard, and has (what else) a ba
nana on the front.
If you cant make it to the G.I. 
show, Knifedance will be at the 
Foundry on Friday. They play, 
punk rock, but it leans hard to-, 
wards the rock part and less towards 
the punk, so those of you looking for a 
bit of a pit might want to look else
where. Besides, theres things like 
metal and concrete there that kind of 
discourage slamming, or at least slam83,Is,ue1 3, 0Cae o7
Joe Bob goes mall-hopping with Wanda and Doreen Bodine
"Wanda Bodine finally got back 
in town from going to Law School 
at' the University of Arkansas 
where she majored in People That 
Lose One or Several Limbs, and
wedge through doors constructed 
for the needs of mere 400-poun
ders. And, actually, I talked to the 
mall manager, Clyde Spragins, 
about it, and for a while we deafter about a half hour of bawling cided the only thing to do was 
like a baby buffalo that got its foot harpoon both of em, hook em up
caught in a bear trap, I agreed to 
take her and her sister Doreen to 
the mall to get some Mexican 
buffet. But, what happened is, 
after we ate dinner, Doreen wan
dered into Mrs. Fields Cookie 
store and ordered the Macadamia Mount McKinley, and by the 
time I figured out where shed 
gone, it was too late. The Bodine
to an electric winch, and just start 
cranking. Thats when the media 
showed up.
Within 24 hours a team of crack 
Korean plastic surgeons showed 
up with plans to do quickie body 
tucks on both porkers, then hose 
em down, oil em up, harness em, 
and yank them through the front 
entry with a Nissan truck. But
Indians from a reservation in 
Oklahoma showed up with chainsaws, saying they could cut a path 
through Toys R Us if necessary. 
Donald Trump offered a wreck
ing ball.
On the second day we got the 
sad news that the assistant 
manager couldnt hold out any 
longer. He passed away from the 
smell.
But the story ended happily. 
On the third morning the Transamerica Company came through 
with a guarantee that, whatever 
happened to the double-strength 
industrial glass Mrs. Fields
sisters, in case you haven't ^       o o  doors, they would
run into em lately, now 
weigh about 17,000 pounds 
each, and I knew once they 
got into that store wed 
have to call the fire depart
ment. Doreen started suck-. Joe Bob Coes To The Drive-lu
guarantee the mall against 
lawsuits. Clyde gave the 
signal: Thar she blows! 
But nobody knew what 
that meant so he gave an
other signal: Get them fat
j ing down bakery products       o      o out of my mall! And
like she had a midget 
Hoover vacuum cleaner in her 
stomach, and when Wanda saw 
her doing it, she just naturally 
sailed in, knocking over three or 
four small children as she did.
The rest of youve probably 
heard about CNN by now. Doreen 
and Wands stayed in there way 
past the time I could of got em out 
with color photographs of giant 
burritos. And so by the time we 
took action, theyd run up a $984 
cookie bill, not to mention Doreen 
being so pumped up on sugar she 
was crushing an assistant man
ager between her thighs.
When the mall management got 
there, Wanda and Doreen were 
both slamming against the double 
glass doors, trying to break free, 
but it was that last 89 pounds of 
macadamia that put em over the 
limit. No way were they going to
time was running out, and we all 
thought, What if Nissan wont 
let a Korean drive their trucks? 
Every fifteen minutes either 
Wanda or Doreen would re-surface at the front of the store, choco
late chips hanging off her chin, 
screaming she needed some milk. 
The President sent a telegram: 
Our prayers are with both Wanda 
and Doreen, and with the rescue 
effort  Im watching on televi
sion, and feel, as the whole nation 
does, that our hearts have gone 
out to those two giant stuffed pigs. 
Money and equipment poured 
in from all over the world. The 
Red Cross sent a block and tackle. 
Ringling Brothers sent an ele
phant trainer. It seemed like 
everything else in the world had 
stopped. Only Wanda and Doreen 
mattered. Some Pottawatomi
the SWAT team exploded 
the double glass at the exact 
moment when the Bodine sisters 
were circlingback into the kitchen 
to suck up some more batter. 
There was glass everywhere, then 
silence. We all waited, and after 
the smoke had cleared, Doreens 
left thigh bobbed up through the 
debris and knocked down a vol
unteer fireman. She surfaced 
once, sounded, wagged her rear 
end at her sister, and the two of 
them start.ed to waddle their 
nubby little legs down the mall to
wards J.C. Penneys, slowly be
ginning to get their strength back.
There wasnt a dry eye in the 
mall. Im getting all choked up 
just telling the story. And now I 
suppose my life will never be the 
same.

Director Maurice Pialat teams up with French
 heartthrob Gerard Depardieu (last seen on campus 
' in the title role of Jean de Florette) in giving us this 
 crime melodrama. Depardieu portrays a hardcore 
^ Paris cop who gets involved with the seamy side of 
the underworld and the seamier side of a drug

and criminals  two intimately related families  
are what give this movie its lasting impact. Check it

Empire of the Sun
This one looks good. Christian Bale stars as a 
" young British boy who is separated from his parents 
in Japan during World War II and ends up as a 
prisoner-of-war in a Japanese prison camp. The 
movie follows his adjustment to prison life and the 
loss of innocence that comes with it. The boys ability 
to escape into a fantasy world of airplanes and flying 
jiis one of the few things that keeps him going. Steven 
Spielberg directed; this alone will probably make it 
a worthwhile film to see.

Shoot to Kill
If youre really into thrillers, then this ones for 
you. Sidney Poitier stars as an FBI agent who has to 
follow a killer through the wilderness. He solicits 
help from a man familiar with the area (played by 
Tom Berenger). Apparently, the killer has joined up 
with a tour group, and the two very different pursu
ers have to follow the group through the mountains 
of Montana. The storys predictable, with plenty of 
close calls. And slowly but surely, Poitier and Ber
enger become closer until they are friends. Yes, this 
movie has plenty of action  and plenty of gaping 
holes in the plot. A note for Cheers fans: Kirstie Alley 
has a big role as the tour guide.

big names, including Roy Scheider, John Lithgow,

like this one, but the movie drags somewhat if you 
dont know much about 2001. A note: like the first

Scotch n Soda stuns Yard
By FEDERICO HATTOUM
Special to The Tartan
On November 2nd, 1988, Scotch 
n Soda invited the Carnegie 
Mellon campus and the world to 
partake in one of the most truthaltering experiences since Fruity 
Pebbles hit the market. Many of 
you took the challenge and filled 
our very own Scotland Yard to its 
fire code safety limits. You waited 
anxiously for the first scene to 
begin as small beads of perspira
tion, dare I say sweat, collected 
on your problem set-laden brows. 
And what did you and the world 
think of the premiere episode of 
this soon to be famed soap opera? 
Knowing that such a question 
would arise to spite me if left 
unanswered, I took fate into my 
hands, but let foresight lead the 
way, and questioned a few un
lucky individuals as they vacated 
the great halls of Scotland Yard 
shortly after the end of episode 
one of Les Misinformed. The 
audience was weary and spent 
from the involved performance,
but some managed to whisper 
answers to the question: Did ya 
like it?
Yeah. I liked it, answered a 
bewildered junior.
Is this Kiltie Caf? inquired a 
lost transfer student.
I laughed, I cried, I helped write 
it, commented Javier-Grillo 
Marxuach.
It was great! It was amazing! 
Oh, I thought you meant the 
food..., offered a blockhead.
It was great! When can I see 
part two? asked a satisfied cus
tomer, and winner of the Whats 
the right answer? contest prize 
of the month.
Yes, indeed, the response was 
positive. But for those of you who 
missed it, allow me to elucidate.
All the characters who worked 
at the Hugo Advertising Agency 
were introduced, including: the 
zany Announcer; co-partner of the 
Hugo Advertising Agency, Tad 
Biffington; publicity and thoughtprocess manager, Sara Bellum; 
illustrator, William Bord; traffic 
manager, Planestra Smith; copy
and slogan man, Clark Watcher; 
con-man, Andy Bellum/Albert 
Falfa/Guy Chesthair; evil villainess, Andrea Doria; andhenchman, Dr. Enigma Villmaster. Very 
soon thereafter, the plot unfolded 
all over the place. Episode one 
opened with the realization that 
Sara Bellum was being black
mailed by none other than the 
despicable Tad Biffington. Dr. 
Enigma Villmaster made a brief 
but penetrating appearance and 
showed the near limit of a mans 
movie-quote-recall-ability. Conman Andy Bellum/Albert Falfa/ 
Guy Chesthair slithered his way 
into the Hugo Ad agency with 
intentions that will soon be re
vealed. We saw how well Bill Bord 
and Planestra Smith got along, 
and guessed that the sounds of 
noisy bed frames were not too far 
off in the future. Thrown in for 
dramatic effect was the discovery 
of Planestras alter ego, a fierce 
Russian warrior woman by the 
name of Volga. Making special 
appearances were Manolo and 
Manolo, who offered their latest
movie reviews. And, of course, 
this was the episode when we~ 
first heard anything of any ini: 
portance about GIGANTIS, the 
FIRE MONSTER.
This Wednesday, November 16': 
at 6:30 pm in Scotland Yard brings 
part two of the ongoing saga for 
your perusal and approval. What 
will happen next, you ask? Well; 
then, a few hints to satisfy those  
hungry for Les Misinformed info: 
the true identity of the con-man'1

Artwork depicts natures opposition to man
By JULIETTE BORDA
Special to The Tartan
Some theorists say it all started 
as an unadulterated, vegetated 
planet. Then came man
 and his mind, which 
created stuff such as 
wheels and bricks and 
theaters, and later, tele
phone poles and lightgreen-speckled tar 
shingles and cube-ish 
shopping malls floating 
on asphalt fields. Nature 
has always been in oppo
sition to the products of mans 
mind; its capacity to ruin is what 
Nicole Hertz was fascinated with, 
before and especially after her 
journey to Rome.
Nicoles paintings and drawings 
have dealt with the rhythms cre
ated by structures and architec
tural ruins for a few years, and 
her trip gave her ihsight to the 
feeling, not just the sight, of these 
spaces. Her black and white pho
tographs most accurately portray 
this emotion. An especially capti
vating shot is of The Forum; where 
Rome began. Upon returning from 
Rome to the architectural mar
vels of Pittsburgh, she continued 
her paintings of sacred ruined 
spaces and angular rooftop juxta
positions, only adding an element 
that her past work lackedcolor. 
Nicole figures that while shes 
painting, she may as well learn 
more about how to work with 
bright colors, even though her 
subject matter (rooftops and build
ing corners) is relatively gray. The 
golds and royal blues and her 
new shade, aqua, are courageous 
and successful attempts at some
thing new. Having grown up in 
New York City, Nicole finds that 
painting what has always sur
rounded her comes naturally.
Whereas Nicoles penchant for 
structure guides her work, Alison 
Hutter finds that for her, the 
converse of man-made, nature, 
comes naturally. Alisons mixedmedia drawing/paintings explore 
abstract variations of landscape. 
Like Nicole, Ali uses non-local or 
unrealistic color to express her 
zeal for the usual green-andbrown landscape. She uses mate
rials in combinations of gesso, oil
pastel, charcoal, pencil, chalk 
pastel, and probably a few others, 
depending on whats at hand. Ali 
uses a technique of applying a 
base of many colors, and layering
until she is able to scrape back 
into her piece to reveal some of 
the original layers. I Met This 
Cow, a colorful bovine represen
tation, demonstrates this layering; Ali hopes to donate this piece 
to Mobilization for Animals in ex
change for pamphlets from the 
organization for distribution at 
her show. Ali will show other 
drawings that portray 
animals, not highly real
istically, in their natural, 
unbothered state.
Nicole and Alis show, 
guaranteed to make the 
trek up Margaret Morri
son Street worthwhile, 
opens this evening at the

Rep has Two Masters
By LAURA McILRATH
Tartan Staffwriter
Last weeks Junior Rep 
production, The Servant of Two 
Masters, is not theater in the 
modern sense of the word, and 
Director Glenn Paris did well by 
not trying to make it that. The 
performance consisted of two 
partsthe original 17th century 
play, and an informal section 
before the play and during inter
mission, in which the CMU actors 
played Italian actors who were 
putting on this play for us since 
their flight from Pittsburgh had 
been cancelled.
I'he dramatic frame (the mod
ern section consisting of Italian 
actors making jokes and acting 
siily) served several purposes and 
in many respects saved the play. 
To begin with, it was funny in its 
own right, that is, when we could 
understand the actors accents. 
The audience was laughing 
harder during intermission (when 
one of the Italians was throwing 
himself at the men in the audi
ence) than they were during the 
performance of the play that fol
lowed.
The clowning around that went 
on before the play and during 
intermission was also a way of 
saying, Dont take this produc
tion too seriously. The Commedia dellArte style of the play 
involves direct addresses to the 
audience and other dramatic 
methods that seem stilted and 
unrealistic to an audience accus
tomed to modem theater. Because 
of the dramatic frame we watched 
the play under, we assumed that 
it was the Italian troupe, not the 
CMU Juniors who were giving us 
such hammy performances. The 
students were simply doing a good 
job of playing bad actors.
Unfortunately, the archaic act
ing style was not consistent. While 
Jon Walker and Matt Hofherr 
were wonderfully exaggerated in 
their performances as Truffaldino and Pantalone, the ridiculous 
gusto with which they strutted 
and posed was not matched by 
several of the other characters, 
who ended up looking boring in 
comparison. Still, as long as there 
were a couple of actors up there 
making fools of themselves and 
the others, which they did with 
gusto, the play was a lot of fun.
Modern Languages sponsors films...
German Film Series continues
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The Modern Languages Pro
gram will present the second 
film out of four in its German 
Film Series on Wednesday, 
November 16. The showing of 
highbrow German films on 
campus has been an annual 
event since around the mid1970s.
Professor Christian Hallstein 
is responsible for choosing these 
films and bringing them to 
campus through the German 
Embassy in Washington. He 
spoke of the two main reasons 
for the series. German 
filmmakers, he stated, have 
been in the forefront of filmmak
ing worldwide since 1970. Their 
films are chosen because they 
are on a higher intellectual level. 
Films shown have been the 
works of Fassbinder, Herzog, 
Wenders, and others.
Occasionally German literary 
works that have been filmed 
will be shown to appeal to a 
broader audience. At other 
times, made-for-TV films are
presented. The university can not 
get the latest releases; it receives 
films that were presented five or 
six years before the on-campus 
showing. But because of their 
nature, Professor Hallstein said, 
they have enduring value.
Another reason for these films 
is for the benefit of the German 
students, who receive the oppor
tunity to hear authentic German 
in visual context, said Professor 
Hallstein. I mean authentic in 
the sense of not being confined by 
the classroom. He encourages his 
students to see the films to get 
practice in the listening and 
understanding of German dia
logue.
Somewhat to his regret, the 
average number of people who 
attend each film is approximately 
thirty, and the majority of those 
are not German students, but 
members of the Pittsburgh com
munity. Professor Hallstein hopes 
to attract students as well as oth
ers to the showings. He said the 
films can be compared to what 
one might see at the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse or at the Carnegie 
Museum, with exceptions in that
they are free to all, and Hallstein 
feels that Carnegie Mellon has 
access to a wider range of films 
than other organizations might.
This school year there are three 
films left in the series. Egmont 
will be shown Wednesday, No
vember 16. The story is a tragedy 
by Johann Wolfgang v. Goethe, 
with the topics of freedom, hu
man rights and democracy in 
question.
Kuhle Wampe, directed by Slatan Dudow, will be shown 
Wednesday, January 25, 1989. 
The main topic of this film is the 
period of the Weimar Republic 
when mass unemployment was 
caused by economic recession. It 
depicts the confused political and 
emotional conditions of that time.
The last film is Clavigo, a TV 
production based on another trag
edy by Goethe, about a man seek
ing a career at the imperial pal
ace in Madrid, 1770. This will be 
shown on Wednesday, April 12,
1989.
All films begin at 7 pm in Gregg 
Hall (Porter Hall 100). All are in 
German with English subtitles. 
Admission is free.

The Pittsburgh New Group 
Theater will be opening its sev
enth season on November 17 
with Ibsens modern tragedy, 
Rosmersholm. The cast includes 
Frank Schurter, who graduated 
from the CMU art department 
in 1988 and performed with our 
very own Scotch n Soda drama 
club.
The play may seem particu
larly relevant after the recent 
election, since it deals with that; 
political dynamitethe dreaded 
L-Word. Before writing the play, 
Ibsen visited his native country 
of Norway, where the liberals 
had just swept the elections. Ros-! 
mersholm explores the dark side 
as well as the promise of progressivism, and is a turning 
point in the playwrights focus.
Rosmersholm runs from No
vember 17 through December 
10, with performances Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday eve
nings. For reservations and in
formation call 361-2488. The 
New City Theater is located at

Author Tom Wolfe to speak tonight
By TERENCE SPIES
Vartan Staffwriter
The little blond bud from the 
jreative-writing class is a sure thing, 
jut shell insist on a lot of literary talk 
irst... The big redhead on the lecture 
lommittee will spare me that, but she 
talks to me as if Im seventy years 
)ld.... Little Bud? ... or Big Red?
This caption accompanies a dis;orted, lewd caricature in Tom Wolfes 
The Famous Writer on the College 
[^cture Circuit, from his collection of 
drawings and essays, In Our Time.
Wolfe himself will become the target of 
iis own satire when he speaks on 
ampus tonight in the Skibo Ballroom 
at 7:00 pm.
Wolfe, the poet laureate of pop, is 
'amous for his biting commentary on 
American culture. He has developed a 
nanic, unstructured writing style 
vhich he unleashes on everything from 
;he space program (The Right Stuff) to 
architecture (From Bauhaus to Our
IJ ,,, 1
MpI
House) to the Seventies (In Our Time) 
to modern art (The Painted Word).
Wolfes writing style is different from 
conventional authors and journalists 
because he removes all distance 
between himself and his subject. This 
creates an atmosphere that makes his 
strange metaphors, slang and highly 
elliptical grammar natural and even 
comfortable. An example of this style is 
from The Painted Word:
Then and there I experienced a 
flash known as the Aha! phenomenon, 
and the buried life of contemporary art 
was revealed to me for the first time. 
The fogs lifted! The clouds passed! The 
motes, scales, conjunctival bloodshots, 
and Murine agonies fell away!
Wolfe writes that his unusual 
writing style was born when he was 
behind schedule on an Esquire article. 
The magazine asked him to just type 
out his notes so that someone else 
could rewrite them. Typing his notes 
like a madman, Wolfe hit on his 
wowie style, as he calls it. Esquire

The Famous Writer on the College Lecture Circuit

Schenley Ice Rink opens
printed the notes without revision.
Clearly, Wolfes writing has had an 
impact on American society. Through 
his writings, a few of Wolfes terms 
have made it into the American 
vocabulary: the Right Stuff, radical 
chic, and the Me Decade.
The new journalism was also 
hatched by Wolfe. The new journalism 
allows the writer to become part of the 
subject. This style has permeated 
writing today so that it is now stan
dard for me to talk about myself 
writing this paragraph.
In addition to writing, Wolfe lam
poons with satiric drawings, which 
have been exhibited in New York gal
leries and adorn some of his books. The 
book In Our Time includes a large va
riety of his sketches. The drawings are 
cartoonish, and full of bent, inflated, 
contorted, grotesqueries. Wolfes Ed
ward Kennedy portrait is a hugely fat, 
twisted looking toad-thing. The Seven 
Graces of New York are portrayed as a 
demonic cabbie, a colossal dock porter, 
a shifty lot attendant, a manipulative 
Maitre d, a hat check girl, a tour 
guide, and a traffic cop.
These stark, blunt images are fitting 
with one of Wolfes main targets of 
criticism, modern art. Wolfe argues in 
his essays The Painted Word and 
The Worship of Art that the tastes of 
trendy New Yorkers and corporate 
money have forced out meaningful, 
descriptive art in favor of abstractions 
without visual reward. The Painted 
Word is an expose on Cultureburg, 
the small area of New York City where 
art is made, criticized, and sold. The 
Worship of Art is a newer essay and 
focuses on how art buying has become 
a religion; people hire consultants to 
tell them what is correct to buy so 
that their wealth may be redeemed.
Critics have charged that Wolfe car
ries too much malice for his subjects, 
art or otherwise. Christopher Hitchens 
posits that one of Wolfes more famous 
essays, Radical Chic, bites harder 
than satire, that it was written to do 
harm to its subject, the politics of the 
'60S. Janet Malcolm, critic in the New 
York Review of Books, calls Wolfes 
views on art and architecture worri
some, retrograde, and 
embarrassing.
Wolfes latest opus is 
The Bonfire of the Vani
ties, his first venture 
into fiction. The plot 
follows Sherman 
McCoy, a wealthy bond 
trader, as his life disin
tegrates after he hits a 
black youth with his 
car. As the plot moves,
Wolfe documents New 
York in detail, including 
such tidbits as accents, 
walks, manners, and 
even real estate prices.
Bonfire is, in short, the 
kind of novel a journal
ist would write.
Bonfire of the Vanities 
attacks black dema
gogues, vapid socialites, 
power hungry attorneys 
money-hungry young 
men baying for money 
on the bond market, 
and the whole attitude 
of the Eighties in gen
eral. Sherman McCoy is 
going broke on a mil
lion-dollar salary. Dis
trict attorneys live in 
constant fear of those 
they represent. Politi
cally motivated power 
brokers organize fake 
protests to gain pre
cious time on the eve
ning television news.
Wolfe paints a grim pic
ture of New York in the 
Eighties.
Criticism of the novel 
has centered on two faults. The first 
argument, like earlier criticism, says 
that Wolfe is too angry and hateful: 
Malice is a powerful spice. Too much 
can ruin the stew, and Mr. Wolfe 
comes close. (NY Times Book Review).
Second, several critics say that his 
depiction of blacks is racist, citing his 
descriptions of black youths, tall and 
rangy, wearing white sneakers, shuf
fling along with a gait Wolfe calls the 
Pimp Roll. Wolfe says that the de\
scription is an accurate depiction of 
what an assistant district attorney 
sees on the racial front.
Wolfes lecture promises to be in
sightful, controversial, and above all, 
entertaining. His free-flowing satire 
and irreverent wit should provide more 
than a few needles and barbs for the 
students of the apathetic Eighties.
Tickets are available at the Skibo 
Information Desk for $1.

Although the weather here in

[uite a bit lately, most of us can 
eel the sharp cold wind at night

Shooting hoops" for MS
By LORI MARRACINO
Tartan Staffwriter
Theta Xi will be hosting its 
first annual fund-raising bas
ketball tournament for Multiple 
Sclerosis this Saturday, Novem
ber 13. Basket Bucks 88 is a 
community-wide effort that will 
involve sixteen teams formed by 
various student organizations. 
The tournament will also include 
special exhibition games in 
which student teams will play 
against teams from WDVE 
(102.5 FM) and Pittsburgh 
Public Safety/Liquor Control 
(LCB). The goal of this event is 
to raise $10,000 for the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society.
The idea of a basketball tour
nament was arrived at by the 
members of Theta Xi as a new 
approach to. fundraising that 
would be successful. Intramu
ral basketball is really big on 
campus, and we thought it would 
be a lot of fun to raise money for 
MS with a basketball tourna
ment, commented Jon Kaplan, 
Director of Media Relations.
A few weeks ago, many cam
pus organizations were asked if 
they would be interested in en
tering a team in the tournament. 
This phase of the organizing was 
headed by Tanya Evanovich, Di
rector of Participant Recruit
ment, and resulted in eight fra
ternities and seven other cam
pus organizations that will com
pete in the one-day event.
Each organization in the tour
nament will pay a $50.00 en
trance fee and will also be re
sponsible for the sale of 50 raffle
tickets.
In addition to Grand-Prize and 
First-Prize raffles, there will be 
several smaller raffles. These 
raffles will be held at various times 
throughout the day. Many of the 
prizes have been donated by local 
businesses. Raffle tickets will also 
serve as all-day admission passes 
for the tourm.anent.
Basket Bucks 88 is different 
from past Theta Xi charity efforts 
because it is more comprehensive 
in its fund raising ability. We 
wanted to involve corporate spon
sors. Our past efforts have only 
consisted of collecting money, 
remarked Kishore Rao, Executive 
Director of Basket Bucks. As a 
result, the event has gained spon
sorship from Cameron Coca-Cola
and H.J. Heinz.
Rao commented that in addi
tion to corporate involvement, 
Basket Bucks is also being sup
ported by campus organizations 
such as Carnegie Mellon Dining 
Service (CMDS) and Campus 
Printing. CMDS will be donating 
a portion of their soft drink prof
its during this week and Campus 
Printing has donated the pro
grams for the tournament.
While coordinating this event, 
the members of Theta Xi have

Muffins are the ultimate 
in convenience food. They 
fit in a coat pocket, in a 
crumpled napkin, in a 
hand as you wave frantic
ally for the Shuttle be
tween bites. Just smear 
them with cream cheese, 
jelly, butter, or even noth
ing at all, and go.
And muffins arent even just for break
fast anymore. Of course, homemade ones 
require a little preparation, but thats why 
we all requested kitchens this year, right? 
Thats why you read my column, right?
Corn Muffins
1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1 
cup mi lk, 2 cups flour, 4 tsp baking powder, 
and 3/4 tsp salt.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cream 
butter. Add sugar and beaten eggs and mix 
until light-colored and thick. Mix flour, 
corn meal, baking powder and salt. Add 
dry ingredients to eggmix alternately with 
milk. Beat thoroughly. Put a few table
spoonfuls in well-greased muffin tins and 
bake about 20 minutes, until puffed up and 
the tops are lightly browned. (Source: The 
Settlement Cookbook)
Banana Muffins
1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup 
Crisco or margarine, 1 
tsp baking soda, 3 ta
blespoons hot water, 3 
well-mashed bananas,
2 cups flour, 2 eggs, and 
1/2 teaspoon salt. 
Preheat oven to 350 
degrees. Cream butter and sugar; add eggs 
and beat well. Mix baking soda and hot 
water and add to main ingredients. Add 
salt and half of the flour. Mix in bananas 
and the rest of the flour. Bake 20-25 min
utes in very well-greased muffin tins. 
(Source: Susan Wade)
Honey-Nut Bran Muffins
1/2 cup honey, 2 cups bran (available at 
GNC or other health-food stores), 1 cup 
flour, 1 tbsp melted butter, 1/2 tsp baking 
soda, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and 3/4 
cup finely chopped nuts.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Mix bran, 
flour, baking soda, and salt. Combine milk 
and melted butter, and honey. Mix the two 
mixtures together as fast as possible and 
fold in the nuts. Bake 25 minutes in wellgreased muffin tins.
Alumni change their sex and create confusion
Dear Zazz:
Im an active alumnus of a large 
mens college that will be celebrating 
a 100th anniversary in 1989. As part 
of the preparation for the anniver
sary, I agreed to compile and edit an 
alumni directory.
After contacting thousands of
alumni, Ive collected life stories 
ranging from routine to fascinating 
to inspiring to tragic. But there were 
two responses I didnt expect. Two of 
the male alumni have undergone sexchange surgery and are now women!
One is a nurse who fathered chil
dren before changing his sex. The 
other is married as a woman-to an
other alumnus. And both want to be 
listed in the directory as women. (One 
of the transsexuals says shes coming 
to the celebration because its a per
fect opportunity to face up to impor
tant people from her past.)
Some school administrators say I 
shouldnt print these transsexuals 
biographies in the directory. What do 
you suggest?
-CONFUSED ALUMNI EDITOR
Dear Editor:
As long as these transsexuals met 
the necessary graduation require
ments of your all-male college, it 
doesnt matter that they no longer 
have all the necessary parts of the 
male anatomy. They belong in the 
directory.
The word nee is used to identify a 
womans name before she got mar
ried. You may identify your transsex
ual alumni this way: Susie Jones (nee: 
Sam Jones) and Betty Smith (nee: 
Bob Smith).
If one of your goals is to get people 
to read your directory, printing these 
ladies bios should do the trick.
School officials or other alumni may 
be embarrassed by these listings-but 
thats too bad. They ought to be men 
about it and just accept these women 
for who they are-and were.
Dear Zazz:
I read your column about the 16- 
year-old who killed his mother and 
stepfather. His stepfathers family
wanted to contact the boy in prison t< 
ask why he did it. I have to know whj 
was in his mind that made him ca. 
pable of murdering my brother, 2 
sister of the stepfather said in her 
letter to you.
Well, the 16-year-old is my clos< 
friend. Please print my letter so % 
family of the man who was killed can 
read it.
I dont think they should contact nj$ 
friend. Theyll find more answers ij 
therapy than they will by talking t 
my friend. I, too, have had a hard time 
dealing with what happened. I had 
trouble sleeping. But through ther
apy, Ive gotten help.
I still love my friend, but I recognize 
that he did a very sick thing and hi 
needs help. I have seen him since thf 
murders, and theres been a big change 
in him. Hes getting better, but it wotf 
happen overnight.
I hope the family will take my ad. 
vice: Get therapy and resist contact 
ing my friend-at least for now. I hop? 
they can get on with their lives,

i 1 have a confession to make. I

irtan Sports Editor
With a blank cassette tape in 
pocket and a pink three-ring 
nder under her arm, Nicolle 
iigin walks up the huge stairse in the College of Fine Arts 
imming an aria from the Marige of Figaro.
It is a quarter after one oclock 
id Nikki is 15 minutes early for 
nat she and other voice majors 
nsider their most important 
ass  the weekly voice lesson, 
ikill some of the time, she opens 
pink notebook and slaps 
[rough the photocopied pages of 
usic until she comes to the piece 
will be working on for today, 
One Is Alone, from the 
usical Into the Woods by Stephen 
mdheim. She perches herself 
the ledge of the mezz, 35 feet 
love the main floor of CFA, and 
gins mouthing the words.
Playing Game is played over a 
grid of heptagons covering a fifty 
mile radius. The basic rules of the 
Momentary Lapse of Javi RolePlaying Game are essayed in ten 
Bible-sized tomes which have to 
be purchased separately at a cost 
of fifty dollars apiece. One of the 
rules stipulates that over six 
hundred people are needed to play 
the game. Each one of the players 
must make an investment of over 
six thousand dollars for the starter 
set of equipment needed to play.
The abridged game involves a 
journey through the key events of 
the history of the western world 
from pre-history through the rise 
of America as a world power and
ends when one of the players suc
cessfully finishes writing the col
umn and hands it to the Tartan 
Features Editor (who takes the 
place of the dungeon master) 
before the deadline is up. All you 
will need to play this condensed 
version is a standard set of RolePlaying Game dice.
The game centers around two 
basic tables. The player matches 
the number rolled on the die with 
the number on the table and finds 
out what he or she will be writing 
in the column.
Standard Angry Complaint 
Table
(Roll an eleven-sided die)
1. My lousy love life at Carnegie 
Mellon.
2. Richard Cyert.
3. Richard Cyerts lousy love 
life at Carnegie Mellon.
4. Manure on the Cut.
5. Manure on my shoes after 
walking through the Cut.
6. Manure on Dick Cyerts shoes 
after walking through the cut.
7. Having to turn in a urine 
sample in order to add/drop a 
course.
8. Food Service. (Actually, there 
is a separate food service com
plaint table, but most players do 
not use it because the table itself 
is about fifty feet long and it in
volves rolling a three hundred
sided die.)
9. People who wear Bennetton 
clothes.
10. The fact that only two people 
can fit comfortably inside Enspecial relationship in CFA.
Also on the mezz are other music 
students talking about their 
classes or working. A trumpet 
player shakes the spit out of his 
instrument following a practice 
session, while a piano major 
strokes and dots a piece of music 
paper for composition class. As 
Nikki closes her book to go to her 
teachers studio, two other voice 
majors discuss the Opera Work
shop recital. The two girls are 
both juniors and are very excited 
and nervous about the recital on 
Sunday. They say things are going 
well. Nikki wishes them luck.
Professor Charlotte Blacks 
studio is in the middle of the long 
hall of studios and offices on the 
second floor  the music floor  
in CFA. Its 1:30. Its Nikkis turn, 
and she breezes into the small 
studio with a huge smile which is 
met by the same anticipation and 
smile of her teacher, Charlotte.

11. The fact that there are 
Japanese soldiers who dont know 
the War has ended still waiting 
for their menu items from Scot
land Yard.
Bad Metaphor Table
(Roll a nine-sided die)
1. The Russian Government.
2. Bread and butter.
3. The South African Govern
ment.
4. Barry Manilow.
5. Francos Reign of Terror over 
Spain in the Thirties.
6. The new Tiffany album.
7. Papa Doc Duvalier and the 
Ton-Ton Macoute.
8. The average episode of ALF.
9. Benito Mussolini and the 
invasion of Ethiopia.
At this point there are only two 
steps in the game: writing the 
column and getting it to the edi
tor in time.
Step One:
Writing The Column
This is done rather simply. Roll 
a nine and an eleven-sided die 
intermittently and cross-refer
ence with the tables above in order 
to create the column. For example,
rolling a seven and a five will 
yield the following passage: 
Having to turn in a urine 
sample in order to add/drop a 
course makes Carnegie Mellon no 
better than Francos Reign of 
Terror over Spain during the 
Thirties.
Of course, it can also yield dis
astrous results, like rolling an 
eleven and a six:
There are Japanese soldiers 
still waiting for their food at Scot
land Yard who are no better than 
the new Tiffany album.
It is because of this that the 
player must use discretion in 
writing the column. A bad col
umn can cause problems with the 
final step of the game.
Step Two:
Meeting Your Deadline 
Roll a nine-sided die and con
sult the Last Minute Difficulty 
Table.
Last Minute Difficulty Table
(Roll a nine-sided die)
1. Attacked by death squad 
made up of angry cheerleaders 
you insulted last week. You die 
and lose the game.
2. Computer virus eats your
data. Start again.
3. Attacked by angry librarians 
you insulted last week. You die 
and lose the game.
4. Andrew eats your data. Start 
again.
5. Attacked by angry Bennetton-Wearing Death Squad. You 
die and lose the game.
6. IBM PC eats your data. Start 
again.
7. Attacked by Richard Cyert. 
You are expelled from school and 
lose more than just the game.
8. Editor hates your column. 
You commit suicide and lose the 
game.
9. Editor loves your column. You 
win the game and live happily 
ever after.
And so ends the game. I hope

By Sara Flynn
that begins in the morning when 
you bound into the kitchen and 
find the whole family together.
Dads got the parts of the 
blender spread out on the 
counter, while Mom hacks away 
at a frozen turkey. Granny stops 
talking about the cousin who 
never writes, as you open the 
refrigerator. She asks you if you 
are using the telephone notepad 
and pen set she gave you last 
year,this is a topic you want to 
avoid since you have not writ
ten her a thank you note yet. 
Fortunately, your father wants
you to put all the parts of the 
blender back together while you 
discuss the grade you received in 
microeconomics. Mother wants to 
share with you too, and she hands 
you 22 potatoes to peel.
Only at Thanksgiving can this 
family spirit inspire your sister to 
sneak into the basement and 
drink grain alcohol with the dog. 
You would like to join her, but 
someone has to fix the television 
reception with a coat hanger and 
tinfoil.
Even after the holiday ends, 
you can still treasure the memory 
as you sit in a plane on the run
way for two hours. Use that time 
to think of a way to convince your 
siblings that your mother needs a 
snowboard for Christmas.

Dear Specs:
My girlfriend and I live 400

Dear Anxious:
Start counting the hours. Its 
quite popular among couples to
discuss how many months, days 
and hours theyve been together. 
Do the same for the amount of 
time youll be apart. Its tradi
tional to be able to recall the fig
ures from memory, but feel free to 
use a calculator.
During the time you are apart, 
call her every few minutes. Make 
kissing noises in the phone and 
discuss the differences in climate 
you are both experiencing. For a 
romantic touch, include her in 
your description of the tempera
ture, humidity, etc. (e.g., The rain 
on the roof reminds me of you.) 
Make sure you keep her mem
ory alive by mentioning her, or 
repeating a comment she made, 
to your family. These quotations 
often leave others speechless, 
since no one knows her or really 
cares what she thinks about the 
lima beans at Kiltie.
Persevere, by the end of the 
weekend you could probably de
scribe every little thing she has 
done that you could categorize as 
cute.

Dear Veggie:
You have several options.
1. During lunch, pull a pea

It will serve as a symbol that 
you dont like what is being

2. Send the hostess anony
mous notes that say Animal

scientific will influence her; for 
example, try 99% of all Tur

3. Since you dont eat ani

In this way, its simple to ex

Job Express matches students and jobs
By LORI MARRACINO
Tartan Staffwriter
Job Express is a student-run 
temporary employment agency in 
jts second year at Carnegie Mel
lon. The goal of the organization 
is to match students and tempo
rary employers with the aid of a 
computer database that records 
student job preferences and time 
constraints.
Currently, many of the job 
opportunities involve unskilled 
labor for students. We hope to 
get a lot more skilled labor. The 
vision of Job Express is to find 
jobs for students based on their 
major, commented David Bland, 
President of Job Express.
; None of the jobs that people 
will get through Job Express will 
pay less than $5.00 per hour,  
Stated Robert Borsi, Vice Presi
dent of Marketing and Public 
Relations. The group hopes that 
temporary jobs will be an alterna
tive source of income for those
students who find it difficult to fit 
regular employment into their 
academic schedules.
When a student is matched to a 
job, the student is contacted by 
Job Express, but is under no obli
gation to accept the offer. The 
student will again be contacted 
when other jobs that fit his or her 
preferences become available.
The two immediate concerns of 
Job Express are to make more 
students aware of their service 
and to find more employment 
opportunities for the students.
To accomplish the first objec
tive, Job Express will be sending 
employment applications to stu
dents in the next few weeks on 
which the students will be asked 
to specify their job preferences 
and available times. This infor
mation will be transferred to 
computer, and students will be 
matched with employment oppor
tunities, with no fee or payment 
taken by Job Express.
In order to expand and diversify the types of employment 
available for students, new em
ployers will be contacted both in 
the surrounding community on 
campus. This year we are focus
ing on the faculty. There will be a 
lot of jobs on campus, commented 
Scott Huang, Vice President of 
Student Relations.
On-campus jobs will be espe
cially convenient for students 
because they will be compara
tively high-paying, yet will in
volve minimal travelling. For the 
off-campus effort, members of Job 
Express will canvass the commu
nities of Shady side and Squirrel 
Hill to find new employers.
The idea for Job Express is 
based on Rent-A-Tech, a student 
organization which matched 
Carnegie Mellon students with 
employers during the late 1970s. 
Rent-A-Tech operated success
fully as a division of the Student 
Corporation, which is now the 
University Entrepreneurial As
sociation (UEA).
Job Express is a relatively new 
division of UEA. Other divisions 
include a t-shirt company, Desk
Top Publishing, a moving com
pany, and a discount stereo sales 
company. Each division is a sepa
rately run, independent company.
UEA is funded partially by 
Student Senate. Any company 
profits are reinvested. The group 
is open to all Carnegie Mellon 
students and meets every Tues
day at 4:30 pm in Skibo room 12.
Cholesterol 
is a fat sol
uble substance which is an im
portant component in cell mem
branes and many aspects of me
tabolism in the body. It is also a 
well known factor in the risk of 
development of heart attacks and 
other vascular diseases. The 
importance of cholesterol has 
recently been reemphasized in the 
publication of the Report of the 
National Cholesterol Education 
Program. Expert Panel on Detec
tion, Evaluation, and Treatment 
of High Blood Cholesterol in 
Adults. This issue has impact on 
people of all ages, and this article 
will summarize the salient points 
of the report, published in Janu
ary 1988.
Cholesterol is present in many 
foods we eat, and is also manufac
tured by the liver in humans. 
There are several types of choles
terol found in the blood, the two 
most important being: low den
sity lipaprotein (LDL) and high 
density lipaprotein (HDL). LDL 
is implicated as a major risk fac
tor in the development of heart 
disease due to accumulation of 
fatty plaques in the arteries.
HDL is inversely related to the 
risk of development of coronary 
artery disease, and is also known 
as good cholesterol People with 
high levels of HDL in the body 
seem to be protected against the. 
development of heart disease.
Epidemiologic evidence has 
shown that the risk of death from 
coronary artery disease increases 
linearly as the blood cholesterol 
rises. The risk seems to increase 
when the cholesterol rises above 
200 mg/DL. The desirable level 
of cholesterol has therefore been 
redefined as 200 mg/DL or less.
When the cholesterol is 2OO-40(j 
it is considered to be in the b0r. 
derline range. Borderline chi 
lesterols should be evaluated 
the individual has other risk fac. 
tors for developing coronary 
ease. A cholesterol above 240 
DL is considered to be elevated*
Several important studies have 
shown that lowering the blooc 
cholesterol by dietary interven. 
tion and/or drugs lowers the incj. 
dence of heart disease. Lowering 
the blood cholesterol by 1% re. 
duces the risk of coronary disease 
by about 2%. Therefore, lowering 
cholesterol, along with smoking 
cessation and control of 1 
tension, is a major factor in th* 
modification of coronary 
risk.
Arteriosclerosis, the depositior 
of fatty plaques in the arteries, is 
a disease which occurs slowly 
years. The end result is blockag 
of arteries, which leads to hear 
attack and stroke. Autopsy stud 
ies have demonstrated fattj 
streaks in the arteries of chi]

dents in many aspects of the voice, 
getting the vocalization, body 
language, and emotional tone of a 
pjece just right. She explains the 
jjece must work musically: 
Theres more to it than just the 
notes. Those we work on in the 
jeginning, then we deal with the 
presentation, which is very imiortant.
The voice lesson is broken into 
wo half hour sessions. For the 
frst 30 minutes, Charlotte has 
sjikki vocalize. At first these 
Exercises look and sound very 
jtrange. For lip trills, the mouth 
s closed and the student blows 
iir in order to make the lips flap 
irery rapidly, while making the 
jound go up and down the scale 
iVith the piano. This exercise is 
/ery important for breath supiort.
In third grade, in her native 
jew York, Nikki was given a 
Yench horn to play in an introluctory music class. She confesses 
hat at first she was miserable, 
iut through work and encouragenent, she learned to love it. Nikki 
ilayed with the New York Youth 
lymphony in Carnegie Hall. She 
oured Europe with her schools . 
husic department, and studied 
itTanglewood. After a freshman 
-ear at Boston University studyng the French horn, she trans
erred to Carnegie Mellon in orler to study voice.
I always wanted to be a singer, 
tys the 20 year old sophomore. 
Everybody else always wanted 
ne to be a French horn player. 
She chose CMU because I heard
"Nikki feels free to talk to Charlotte 
and ask for advice on a great many is
sues. What this relationship does is 
force both to work harder for the 
other.
that [the music department! had 
a Musical Theatre Program. (The 
department has since dissolved 
this program which caused Nikki 
and some other Musical Theatre/ 
Voice students a great deal of 
distress. She said that she did not 
audition for the Drama Depart
ment, which has a Musical The
atre program, because They were 
full at the time and I didnt apply 
to CMU until June. Besides, I 
wanted to stay with the musical 
aspect of theatre more since that 
is where most of my training has 
been.)
Last year, when she first ar
rived at CMU, her first weeks 
were harrowing. I didnt find out 
I got accepted [into the Music 
Department] until two weeks 
before school started. Her first 
impressions were, What the helt 
have I done? She confesses that 
since she did not know anyone 
she was scared and very intimi
dated about the school. In addi
tion, she had to live in Shadyside 
in an apartment all by herself 
which added to her depression 
and doubt of her decision. If it 
wasnt for Charlotte last year, I 
dont think I would have made it.
Quitting my French horn, living 
way off campus; I was a mess and 
she helped .me through it.
Nikki admits that Charlotte 
was her first real friend at CMU. 
The nature of the business that 
voice majors (as well as other 
musicians and actors) are going 
into forces them to first respect 
their teachers. If Nikki did not 
respect Charlotte, she would not 
take the work they were doing 
seriously and would be wasting 
time. This would have serious 
repercussions on Nikkis future 
career. However, what has hap
pened in the case of these two is 
that respect has grown into a 
friendship that has only enhanced 
the work they do.
It is rare that a teacher and a 
student have such a close-knit 
relationship. Here, the student is 
dependent on the teacher not just 
for knowledge of her art, but for 
guidance in life. Nikki does not 
simply depend on Charlotte to 
teach her how to sing. She feels
free to talk to Charlotte and ask 
for advice on a great many issues. 
Nikki feels she can do this partly 
because of Charlottes age. She 
is younger than a lot of the voice 
teachers; I call her Charlotte, not 
Ms. Black. What this relation
ship does is force both to work 
harder for the other.
Charlotte, however, cannot 
admit that it is necessarily im
portant for her to be liked by her 
students. I have never had any 
problems with any of my students 
except one. She explained how 
this particular student did not 
put forth any effort in the lessons 
or in any of his classes. That 
made me wonder What are you 
doing here? 
In response to the work, Nikki 
says, I want to do well in re
hearsal because I want Charlotte 
to be proud of me. To this end, 
Charlotte claims that the students 
in general try to work too hard 
and get too easily frustrated when 
they cant do all they want to. 
Theyre just babies, she says in 
relation to the voice majors. She 
says that many of them try to sing 
songs (especially classical pieces) 
which they will not be able to do 
really well for another four or five 
years. Our students work very 
hard and I am very proud, she 
added.
Charlotte says that she is often 
very upset by the way other 
members of the CMU community
view the work she and her stu
dents do. They think its all fun 
and games. Just once, she says, 
she would love to bring up a 
computer science major or some 
other non-CFA student to show 
them just how straining and diffi
cult the work truly is.
It is because the work is so tough
that she and Nikki have the rela
tionship they do. Such a profes
sional yet personal combination 
of feelings and attitudes is rare at 
Carnegie Mellon among its teach
ers and students. One pair, howj 
ever, has found this combination 
and will continue making beauti
ful music together.

Hey Mr. Bush, 
ban the DH!
OK, Mr. President-elect Bush,
now that all of this election 
garbage is out of the way, lets 
get down to brass taxes.
It is time you realize that there 
is a silent majority in this coun
try who are sick and tired of all 
the political clap-trap. We want 
you to do something and we 
want you to do it NOW!
Im not talking about the KKK, 
the anti-abortionists, or the 
NRA. Im talking about a group 
much more powerful and down 
right nasty than any of those 
other groups combined. Yes sir, 
Im speaking of, and for, the 
Federation for the Betterment 
of Baseball and Other Stuff.
Our demands:
11 First and foremost, a consti
tutional amendment banning 
the designated hitter from all 
form of organized baseball.
Some friends of mine tried to 
protest outside of the White 
House two years ago with 
banners decrying Pitchers are 
people too! and pictures of 
Reggie Jackson with the inter
national No symbol running 
through them. However, the 
jrreat unwashed were there 
jnarching to Save the Texas 
frairie Chicken, so we headed 
hut to the Iranian embassy 
Harry wanted to take a leak on 
their lawn.
fe)~ A federal restraining order 
from allowing any more fields to 
pe covered with artificial (i.e. 
\stro) turf. Also, the installa
tion of a program getting 
federal and/or state prisoners to 
go out and rip up all that stuff 
and lay down some honest to 
goodness, natural grass.
S) The appointment of Peter 
Ueberroth as Secretary of the 
Treasury. Face it George, the 
man made a profit with the 
11984 Summer Olympics in Los 
Angeles, and helped reaffirm 
the fact that baseball is the 
greatest sport in the world. He 
**>uld kick your budget woes 
4nside of a year, by'God.
'41 Putting pressure on city 
governments to declare the 
.opening of baseball season as a 
3egal holiday.
5).A national quarantine on any 
and all foreigners trying to 
{make soccer an American sport. 
Granted that many cities have 
had, and some still do have, pro 
jteftms, but get real. Keep that 
stuff;over in Europe and South 
America where it belongs.
6 Requiring a semi-annual 
{Psychological analysis of George 
steinbrenner. I think George 
will be as surprised with the 
results as the rest of us will,
Mr. Prez-elect.
71A federal program for our 
elderly. Once a year, prior to the 
ppernng of the college football 
jSGasor^, we send all the old 
feeople that want to go down to 
Georgia and other SEC schools 
for cheering lessons. Such 
Jessons would be essential in 
building morale in people who 
ignored by their no good, 
ungrateful children. Imagine 
^e warmth that one could 
share with grandmother as she 
Sets off the bus back in Pitts
burgh and screams Go Dawgs! 
8) The placement of National 
Guardsmen around college 
football training camps and 
Practice fields to prevent agents 
and pro scouts from seeing the 
athletes. It would give Dan 
Quayle something to do in his 
hours. Im sure ole Dannyy has plenty of experience 
with this type of thing.
CLEVELAND - Oh, how far the mighty 
have fallen. After a 4-0 start, the football Tar
tans season came to a close Saturday with a 
32-22 loss against Case Western Reserve. In 
their final six games, the team managed only 
one victory, against winless Thiel.
Early problems with turnovers all but ended 
the game before it began. After the two teams 
traded punts, running back Robert Schmitt 
fumbled the ball on the CMU 7. The defense 
was able to hold the Spartans back, but Chris 
Hutters field goal made the score 3-0.
It didnt , stay that way very long. On the 
ensuing kickoff, sophomore running back Scott 
Barnyak lost control of the ball at the Tartan 
20. Two plays later, Case quarterback Paul 
Washlock found Jamie Meek in the end zone, 
the first of Washlocks four touchdown strikes 
on the day. A successful point after made the 
score 10-0.
It was an ugly first quarter...we put our
selves in a hole, admitted CMU Head Coach 
Rich Lackner. But team problems werent lim
ited to holding onto the ball, nor were they 
limited to the first quarter.
After the next Tartan drive stalled, Wayne 
Carsons punt left the ball near midfield. On 
the first play of the second quarter, Washlock 
found another target to extend the Spartan 
lead to 16-0.
One final miscue allowed Case to pad its 
lead before the first half ended. Quarterback 
Steve Paterno was victimized for an intercep
tion, handing the ball over to the Spartans at 
the CMU 32. Washlock connected with Jamie 
Meek behind the Carnegie Mellon secondary 
for another touchdown. After Cases two-point 
conversion failed, the score stood at 22-0.
The special teams provided the Tartans the 
break they needed to shake off their doldrums. 
Junior outside linebacker Jim Balouris broke 
through the line of scrimmage to block a Spar
tan punt. Schmitt then took the ball in from 
the eight for CMUs first points of the after
noon. Laszlo Budas bootleg on the conversion 
cut the lead to 22-8.
The winning touchdown came on the next 
drive. The Tartans held Case and forced them 
to kick, but a faked punt brought the ball to the 
Carnegie Mellon 14. The Spartans soon had 
themselves another touchdown and a 21 point 
lead.
The team attempted to come back. Michael 
Hession picked off an errant Washlock pass

Women finish 13th in region
By RACHEL NOBLE
Tartan Staffwriter
The scene for the NCAA Division III 
Cross Country regionals was set in Al
lentown last Saturday on a clear, crisp 
November morning.TheTast race of the 
year was intensified for the Carnegie 
Mellon Womens Cross Country team 
when they heard the news that the CMU 
mens cross country team had gotten first 
place in the region and were going to Na
tionals. In the meantime, the women 
were preparing for what would-be a per
formance not at all reflective of their 
overall ability.
The team finished in 13th place out of 
27 teams, with 344 points. The first over
all team, and the first girl not on that
team to finish, went to Nationals. Taking 
top honors overall was a woman from 
Haverford College, and the team from 
Allegheny College, with 93 points.
For Carnegie Mellon, sophomore Kris
ten Burgard finished 28th, with a time of 
20:13. This put her three places out of 
being an All Mideast Regional cross 
country runner.
I got out a lot slower this year than I 
did last year, and in turn, I had much 
more left at the end than I did last year. 
I am happy that I got close to being in the 
top 25. I never thought I could even get 
close, said Burgard.
Following Burgard, in 58th place, jun
ior Sue Johnson came across the line 
with a time of 20:58. Freshman Carolyn 
Lowe ran through the chute in 80th place
at 21:30. In her last race before return
ing to the basketball court, senior Roseanna Neupauer turned in an excellent 
performance. She was 88th in 21 min* 
utes and 43 seconds.
Sue Sparks said, I was disappointed 
with my performance, as I have beert 
sick all week. I felt weak in the last mil0 
of the race, but I did the best I could. 
She finished with a time of 22:22 i$ 
108th place.
The teams head coach Dario Donatelli 
feels that the team could have don6 
somewhat better, the girls all ran good 
races, but in this particular race they 
needed to look for one another more. Irri 
proud of their performances and aiti 
looking forward to working with them 
in Track.
Mens X-Country advances to 
Division III National meet
By LEN ONEAL
Tartan Staffwriter
For the first time since 1981, the Carnegie 
Mellon Mens Cross Country team has captured 
the Mideast Regional crown, advancing the team 
to this Saturdays NCAA Division III National 
Championships at Washington University in St. 
Louis.
The latest victory marks the twelfth time in the 
last 13 years that a team from Carnegie Mellon 
under the reign of Head Coach Gary Meckley has 
qualified for the National meet. The Tartans fin
ished the meet with 59 points, followed by Glassboro State College (82 -------------------------------------------
Its good to know were 
as good as we are. 
 Head Coach 
Gary Meckley
points), the only other 
team from the region to 
qualify for Nationals.
Once again, as its 
been throughout the 
season, the Tartan 
runners were led byjunior co-captain Dave 
Supp. He completed the 
five mile course in
25:36, placing second behind Rich Bostwick of 
Glassboro State. Bostwick finished in a time of 
25:07, breaking the Allentown College course rec
ord by five seconds.
Finishing in ninth placed for the Tartans was 
their other co-captain, senior Pat Noll. Noll, having 
his finest season yet, made the All-Mideast team 
for the third time in his successful career at CMU, 
and he plans on finishing his career with a bang. 
Weve trained all year for the National Champi
onship, stated Noll. Regionals were just a step
ping stone. The 1988 season starts when the gun 
goes off in St. Louis and 25 minutes later...?
Following Noll across the finish line for the 
Tartans was junior Tim Berger, who grabbed 
13th place with one of his finest performances of 
the season. Mike Damon, one of this years sur
prising freshmen on the squad, finished in 16th 
place and was named to the All-Mideast Fresh
man first team. The final scoring place for the 
Tartans was brought in by junior Gary Meeker, 
who crossed the line in 19th position. These 
three runners, along with Supp and Noll, earned 
All-Mideast honors as well.
The team is entering the National Champi
onships on a high note and Coach Meckley is 
more than pleased with its performance and is 
proud of the effort the team has put forth this 
year. Everyone ran their best today, and now 
our whole season is down to this weekend, he 
stated. I feel that this team will probably live 
up to its potential more than any other team at 
the Championship meet. Its good to know were 
--------------------------------------- as good as we are.
For Meckley, how
ever, winning isnt eve
rything. Seeing his
runners blossom as 
athletes and people is 
more meaningful than 
the number of wins the 
team acquires. Im
^ really proud of this
team. I realize the
hours and sacrifices it takes for them to run at 
this level, and its a shame that some people 
dont realize this, he said. Socially, and some
times academically, these guys are sacrificing 
in order to do the best that they can. And to me, 
thats more important than winning.
What Meckley admires even more, and sees 
as the secret of this years squad, is that the 
guys run together as a team composed of good, 
individual persons who generally like one 
another.
According to Supp, as long as they continue 
this secret for one more race, they can defi
nitely make a run at their pre-season goal  
finishing in the top five in the country. We 
knew that if we did what weve been doing all 
year long, we could win the Region. If we do it 
again at Nationals, we can finish as high as 
fifth.
URC successful at 
Cincinnati regatta
By MELISSA PROIOS
Tartan Staffwriter
The University Rowing Club is 
a rapidly growing group of enthu
siastic individuals all sharing a 
common interest. The club has 
been considerably active in com
petition as well as making devel
opments in training, equipment, 
and equipment storage.
As the winter weather crept into 
Pittsburgh, the University Row
ing Club prepared for its last 
outdoor meet before moving in
doors. The Head of the Licking, a 
three mile, five-thousand meter 
race, took place on Saturday in 
Cincinnati on the Licking River. 
In rowing, a head race is classi
fied as a race between 2 1/2 and 3 
1/2 miles long.
Using borrowed equipment, the 
club raced four boats, three of 
which finished in the top three of 
their divisions. The fourth boat 
did not complete its race due to a 
broken oarlock.
The mens novice four, consist
ing of Brian Carter, Peter Chan, 
Shawn Ohler, Ted Ralphs and 
cox Sophia Chiang, finished first 
in its division with a time of 17:49. 
The boat rowed past two other 
boats, one of which was from the 
University of Chicago, the only 
other University Athletic Asso
ciation team at the meet.
All of the novices in that boat 
began rowing this semester. 
Theyve had no prior experience 
whatsoever, said Harry Printz, 
president of the University Row
ing Club.
The womens novice four came 
across the finish line at 20:53,
which was good enough to earn 
second place, while the mens open 
four boat came in third with a 
time of 17:32.
We were really pleased with 
our performance, said Printzj 
The team pulled together. Peopl^ 
were cheering so hard for eaclj 
other. It was a great bonding 
experience.
The club plans to move indoor^ 
by the end of the week and star$ 
its indoor phase of training ang 
competition. The club will conj 
tinue its program of weight train
ing and basic aerobic fitness,as 
well as adding a new phase of 
actual indoor rowing. The cluB 
purchased rowingorgometers this 
summer with their Student Sen* 
ate Funds. The orgometer is a 
rowing machine that is somewhat 
like a modified bicycle that simuj 
lates rowing. With an electronic 
readout, the machine can be prel 
set for distance to row, time to 
row, or to monitor stroke rate and 
calorie output. The machines will 
be stored in the gym where they 
will be available to URC mem
bers on weekdays.
The club will be concentrating 
on training for their first partici
pation in an indoor regatta with 
orgometers. The competition will 
be modelled after the CRASH-B 
Sprints in Boston (CRASH-B 
stands for Charles River Asso
ciation of Sculling Has-Beens}. 
The orgometers also help to buil'p 
a continuity into the training foV 
the club during the winter months 
when it is too cold to row out
doors.
Another exciting development

Tartans end season with loss to Case

Tartan Basketball teams set up for 89
Men need answers to a lot 
of pre-season questions
Women look to finish in top 
three in PAC and UAA
i By STEWART LEVINE
I Tartan Contributing Editor
The mens basketball team will
 open their season Saturday 
against UAA for Brandeis with
j two major questions on Head
 Coach Larry Andersons mind, 
i One,Is there life after Hart Coleman? Two, Who will run the 
L_ offense?
The Tartans start this year 
P' without two major portions of last
- -seasons 9-12 squad: center and
-  leading scorer Coleman and point 
;  guard Tom Franklin. Despite a 
 sixteen man pre-season roster, the 
team has only four returning lettermen and four other members 
'from 1987-88. The team will look 
S.to its two big men to put in the 
 I points this season. Senior center 
r*  Daren Moffatt and senior forward 
: Darryl Long are the two leading 
returning scorers. The two pro! '; vided an average combined 25 
 points per night and will be exr^ pected to do even more scoring 
;:this season.
tr Joining those two in the front 
tZ court will be a third senior, David 
^Sikora. Sikora was a swingman 
--y last year, playing both guard and 
gj forward. Despite his 63 size,
 Sikora was still fourth on the team 
;-;in rebounding last year and he
finished the season as the teams 
2 fifth leading scorer.
The fourth returning letterman 
% is junior guard Harvey Beckham, 
u Beckham will start at either point 
s-?or shooting guard, but his posi- ;tion will be determined by the 
identity of his backcourt mate.
2 It seems that sophomore Lewis 
^Jackson would have the inside 
31 track for the other spot in the 
3'backcourt. Jackson had a consid5-erable amount of playing time in 
gthe second half of the season. He 
?;was instrumental in the teams 
come-from-behind victory against 
; Hiram College. Jackson stepped 
off the bench to score 19 points in 
the double overtime victory 
against the Terriers.
Also contending for the position 
should be Gary Breauninger and 
Philip Bronner. Breauninger, a 
junior, knows Coach Andersons 
system but has not played due to 
injuries the last two seasons. 
Bronner, a freshman from Co
lumbia, Maryland has looked very 
impressive in early practices.
Also back from last years team 
are Charles Luckett, Keith Mor
gan, and Charles Vaught. Luck
ett will be called upon to spell 
Moffatt and Long in the frontcourt 
while Morgan and Vaught will
add some experience to 
the backcourt.
This years team will 
not have the luxury of 
preparing for a confer
ence season. With 12 
Presidents Athletic 
Conference and 11 
University Athletic As
sociation games, the 
team has only two non
conference dates all 
season, both coming 
during the Carnegie 
Mellon Tournament 
Thanksgiving week
end.
The Tartans will also 
have to learn how to 
win on the road. In 
twelve tries last sea
son, Carnegie Mellon 
was able to manage one 
lone win against Thiel 
College. I think we 
were more tourist 
bound than game 
bound, said Anderson.
The team has twelve 
games on the road, 
visiting each PAC ri
val as well as playing 
UAA games in Cleve
land, New York,
Louis, and Atlanta.
The team begins play this week
end against Brandeis at 6:00 pm

Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
I think well be in the top three 
of both the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) and the 
Presidents Athletic Conference 
(PAC). This is Head Coach Gerri 
Seidls bold prediction for the 
Carnegie Mellon Womens Bas
ketball team in its 1988-89 sea
son. Last year, the Lady Tartans 
finished fourth in the PAC (6-6), 
3-2 in the UAA and 12-13 overall. 
The team has had only one win
ning season in its history.
The squad is 16 members 
strong; the largest ever at CMU. 
The team consists of nine return
ing players, including all of last 
years starters, six freshmen and 
a transfer student.
Seidl feels that the team is 
better skilled and more versatile 
than in previous years. She is also 
very confident in her players on 
the bench. We have more depth 
than weve ever had, she said. 
Our biggest strength is our sea
soned players as well as a bench. 
They [the players] can be strong 
for every second that theyre in.
Seidl is also pleased with the 
leadership, provided by the team 
captains, seniors Lisa Lightner, 
Aimee Reber and Beth Virgin, 
both on and off the court. The 
team is so united at this point. Its 
a true unit, not just basketball.
The Lady Tartans are looking 
to play a pressing game defen
sively and offensively, running 
what Seidl refers to as an option 
offense. The experienced play
ers know the planned offense and 
how to add to it, and the skilled 
players know how to read situ
ations and react to them. Prac
tices are more gamelike, which 
helps the players. We do more full 
court work rather than half court.
In terms of weaknesses, Seidl 
is most concerned with the teams 
defense. Everyone plays good 
individual defense, but its not a 
good team man-to-man.
Another major concern for Seidl 
is the health of her players. At 
one point last season, three of the 
starting five players were playing 
with injuries. Most players get 
injured when they are tired. We 
have the luxury to take them out 
and rest them. This helps to de
crease injuries.
The team starts its season this 
weekend in Cleveland against 
Brandeis University on Saturday 
at 4:00 pm, and against Case 
Western Reserve University on 
Sunday at 1:00 pm.
6-Person Volleyball ends 
with exciting title matches
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
This week in IM Volleyball, 
the playoffs and championship 
games were played for all three 
leagues. In the Major League, 
CGSO battled GSIA for a spot 
in the championship game. 
CGSO quickly showed why 
they were undefeated coming 
into the series. The front line of 
their team almost always set 
the ball up for a spike, which 
was impossible to return. 
CGSO won the first game eas
ily by a score of 15-6 and the 
second game, 15-4.
The other position in the
championship game would be 
filled by either the Networkers 
or the injury-plagued Offen
sive Policy. These two teams 
played earlier this year for the 
Co-Rec volleyball title. The 
Networkers, playing under the 
name Team Foo, won the se
ries, two games to one.
Offensive Policy started 
game one by exploiting a hole 
in the Networkers defense. The 
Networkers fixed the problem 
but not before Offensive Policy 
had a four point lead. The 
Networkers got control of the 
game and scored twelve points 
before Offensive Policy called a

Is it time to fire Noll?
By WARREN FLAX
Tartan Staffwriter
Football games are won with defense and special teams. Its'an 
age old equation for success that coaches and sportswriters loVe. 
Keeping that in mind, it is not surprising to see the Steelers record 
at 2-9.
With the worst rated defense in the AFC, the NFLs worst pass 
defense and an NFL record 5 punts blocked (In only nine games!), the 
Steelers ineptitude has caused both their fans and the media to call 
for the firing of Head Coach and Director of Player Personnel Chuck 
Noll.
Now, it may seem unfair that both the Pittsburgh Press, Post 
Gazette and Sports Illustrated have run articles placing the blame 
for the Steelers demise from four-time Super Bowl Champions to 
cellar dwellers on Noll, but if we examine this season and the drafts 
leading up to it the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of The 
Emperor.
Bad teams find ways to lose games by making mental errors and the 
Steelers are one of those teams. Poor coaching is directly responsible 
for players making mental mistakes. Pittsburghs turnover ratio is 
negative five, which means that their giveaways outnumber their 
takeaways by five. The five blocked punts not only represent a league 
record, but also exemplify a poorly coached team.
Another example of why Noll is unpopular these days is his archaic, 
predictable offensive scheme. Said quarterback Bubby Brister, We 
might as well punt on first down and get it over with. The Steelers 
have a patent on the run-run-pass-punt series and have all the flair 
of a Tartan Grill hamburger. For example, in that 42-7 destruction at 
the hands of the Cincinnati Bengals two weeks ago, with the Bengals 
leading 35-7, Noll ran on eight of the next ten Pittsburgh offensive 
plays.
In addition to his play calling, Chuck Nolls draft day decisions 
should be questioned. Since the 1974 draft exactly three Noll draftees 
have gone to the Pro Bowl. This seasons number one pick, Aaron 
Jones, was supposed to help the ailing Steeler pass rush. Jones has 
one sack and twelve tackles in the first ten games. Noll has never 
traded up in a draft and did not take a single player from the USEL, 
a league that produced Herschel Walker, Reggie White, Kelvin 
Bryant and many other NFL starters.
After the debacle in Cincinnati, Noll said Its the worst exampleof 
football Ive seen in a longtime. Wed have trouble with a grade-school 
team. Does this mean that it wasnt the worst he has seen ever? It 
was the fourth worst beating in Pittsburgh history and if you consider 
that the Bengals only had the ball for three minutes more than the 
Steelers you realize how quickly Cincinnati was able to score, and 
how inept the Steeler offense was.
The Steelers season was best put into perspective by Noll who sug
gested that the team return to training camp and start all over. The 
question is whether the Steelers would be better off with him or 
without him.

Burgard paces Lady Tartans
By ROBIN HESINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Kristin Burgard, one of the top 
female runners at Carnegie Mel
lon, is having one of her best cross
country seasons ever. She has 
been running consistently all
in running and her improvements 
to Dario Donatelli, the womens 
coach. She says,  He knows what 
he is talking about because he is 
an experienced runner.
The one thing that has helped 
her the most was concentrating 
on pace. She says that in high
cross-country, swim, and track 
teams along with Burgard. It was 
very competitive and it wasnt 
very friendly, remarks Burgard. 
She says that every practice was 
like running a race. Erin, Kristin, 
and Kara held first, second and 
third place, respectively, on the
year, placing first for the team at school the idea was to go out as team for two years. During
every dual meet this season.
Burgard, a sophomore, re
cently came in first for Car
negie Mellon at the 
Presidents Athletic Confer; ence, placing second overall.
Since she has been here she 
i has had much success on the 
cross-country team and has 
sdt track records as well.
This year is definitely 
^tter than last year, says 
gurgard concerning her per
formance. Although she ran 
' well as a freshman, she has 
; improved a great deal since 
I last cross-country season,
| (..placing first or second at 
every meet (for the team) 
tying twice with Sue 
' Johnson. Johnson came in 
before Burgard at the IUP 
invitational and the UAA 
iihampionships. Burgard 
.considers Johnson and her
self to be equally matched,
: and says that they run well 
;.i together.
! ..During track season last 
,y,ear, Burgard won the 
,Rresidents Athletic Confer
ence as a freshman in the 
9f4500m. She not only won the 
-,|Gonference, she also set three 
-records for Carnegie Mellon in 
jjthe 1500m, the 5000m and the 
gi]y)00m. Johnson later broke 
Burgards record for the 3000m.
Burgard remarks that she was 
in good shape goinginto the cross
-country season freshman year, 
.j,However, she was disappointed 
j that she did not do as well as she 
.should have. She also said that 
, ,the gap between herself and the 
other runners seemed to get 
smaller as the year went on.
.Burgard attributes her changes
fast as you can all the time, which

usually makes you tired at r^e 
end of the race. She says that she 
can feel the difference because 
she is more in control. Donatelli 
has often said that Burgard al
ways wants to overtrain. She has 
learned recently that she does not 
have to kill herself to run well.
One of the contributing reasons 
why Burgard ran fast in high 
school was because of the stiff 
competition: her sisters.
Burgards sisters, Erin (freshman, 
Grove City) and Kara (senior in 
high school) competed on the
Kristins senior year, she and Erin 
started running with each 
other instead of against each 
other. Erin was also injured 
that year and Kristin became 
the top runner for the team.
At the PAC Championship 
held here at Carnegie Mel
lon on October 29th, Burgard 
(who came in second) ran 
against her sister who runs 
for Grove City. She says that 
her sister would be one of 
their top runners if she was 
not still injured.
Burgard started running 
track when she was in fifth 
grade. She joined the track 
team in junior high because 
she said her parents told her 
she had to join band or run. 
Running was a wise choice 
considering she qualified for 
the State Championships for 
four years, and was ninth in 
Western Pennsylvania dur
ing her freshman year in high 
school.
Burgard says she runs be
cause she would be very 
stressed if she only had school 
work to do. She says that she 
sometimes feels pressured 
until she goes to practice, where 
she feels that she has achieved 
something. She also says that 
running on the team, is a social 
thing. She is very friendly with 
the women on the team, and they 
go out socially as well as on the 
course.
Burgard has never had any 
substantial injuries that have 
interrupted her performance, 
unlike many successful athletes. 
She has two more years to run for 
CMU to perfect her running skills

Pittsburgh hosts
Ultimate regionals HOW tO HlilkG  hit.
By SHAFI KHAN
'Tartan Staffwriter
Sixteen mens and ten womens 
Ultimate teams competed for the 
"Ultimate Players Association 
Mid-Atlantic Regional Champi
onships at Hampton Community 
'Park last Saturday and Sunday, 
November 5th and 6th.
The men played in a double
elimination tournament and the 
women competed in a round-robin 
tournament, consisting of two 
groups of five. Both vied for bids 
to the National Championships 
to be held in San Diego at Thanks
giving. Club teams from Pennsyl
vania, New Jersey, Maryland, 
Delaware, Washington D.C., Vir
ginia, and North Carolina par
ticipated in the competition.
Crash, Pittsburghs mens 
team, which finished third in the 
Regional playoff the past two 
years, placed fourth out of sixteen 
teams with three wins and two 
losses.
Crash played the Baltimore B 
team, Dain Bramage, in the first 
round and beat them handily (15- 
In the second round, they de
feated Yall from North Caro
lina (15-6). They lost a tough game 
to "Yo Mama from Washington 
D-C., by a score of 17-12, which 
dropped them to the losers 
bracket. Crash then came back 
to beat Just Say No who was the 
ft team from D.C., 17-12. They 
lost to PhilMore in the losers 
bracket semi-final, 19-14.
Players from the Crash that 
attend Carnegie Mellon are: Mark 
Licata, Greg Wolff, Dan Goldman, 
pave Detleft, Joe Enck, Darren 
Weideman, Dave Steers and Paul 
Drake.
PhilMore, a team consisting 
Ijj" Players from Philadelphia and 
Baltimore, won the losers bracket 
"ith a 4-1 record and earned one
the two berths to compete in 
Nationals. The other team to
qualify for Nationals was a New 
Jersey team, Looney-Tunes, 
who were undefeated in four 
games during the tournament.
A newly formed womens team, 
Skitzos, participated in the 
Regionals for the first time and 
placed third in their pool of five 
teams with a 2-2 record. Player 
Nancy McNamee said, Consid
ering the terrible weather condi
tions and relative inexperience, 
we are ecstatic about our finish.
They lost to Lawn Party from 
D.C., 13-3 and got crushed by 
Cool Mama Seven, another D.C. 
team, 13-1. They shut out the 
North Carolina team, 13-0, and 
killed the Kamikazes (from 
Philadelphia), 13-5. The five play
ers from the Skitzos that are 
from Carnegie Mellon are 
Christine Leach, Teri Breier, 
Jenny Robertson, Aelan Tierney, 
and Rachel Noble.
Cool Mama Seven finished 
first among the ten womens 
teams and will participate in 
Nationals. The Zephyrs finished 
second in the round-robin tour
nament.
The object of the game is to 
score goals by passing a flying 
disc to a teammate in the endzone. 
Players may not run with the 
disc, but utilize throwing, catch
ing, and running skills to work 
the disc into the goal. Defensive 
players attempt to intercept or 
block the passes, thereby gaining 
possession and the chance to score. 
Players officiate their own games 
on an honor system, even at the 
highest levels of competition.
Carnegie Mellons mens Ulti
mate Club, Mr. Yuk, will com
pete again this spring. This years 
squad is hungry to compete in the 
championship finals, after nar
rowly missing the semi-finals at 
last years Nationals by one point.
The womens team is also look
ing to compete in regional action 
in the spring.

Swimmers dive into 88-89 season
By MELIZA YUMANG
Tartan. Staffwriter
I This Friday, the Carnegie Mel[lon swim teams kick off their 1988- 
{89 season in top form at a relay 
meet at Westminister College. 
They will face Grove City College, 
Edinborough University, Fairjmont University, and the host 
team, Westminister.
| H6ad Coach Jim Perkins looks 
[forward to the teams performjance this year. We expect to do a 
lot better this year. Im quite confident that were a lot better, based 
jon our performances from last 
year. The team is looking forward 
to the season with great enthusi
asm.
! Both the mens and womens 
beams hope to improve their 
standings from last year, espe
cially in the big tournaments. Last 
year, the men won the Presidents 
Athletic Conference (PAC) Cham
pionship for the first time and 
placed fifth at the University Ath
letic Association (UAA) Tourna
ment. The women finished sec
ond at the PACs and came in 
eighth at the UAAs.
The teams have been training 
iard since September, almost 
seven days a week, and are 
stronger than they have ever been. 
The top returning swimmers for 
;he womens team are co-captain 
, Suzanne Kelley, Anita Fisher and 
Tiffany Pickering. Top returning 
swimmers for the men are coaptains Greg Schooley and Dave 
Chamberlin, as well as Pat Hen: ;ler.
Also, the team is very proud 
md excited to show off the new 
recruits of Coach Perkins. Junior 
Pat Hensler commented, We 
hould: do really well. We lost a 
:ouple of good people from last 
'ear, but the freshman are doing
well in practice. And it looks like 
were going to make up for the 
people we lost. Were also hoping 
to qualify a lot more people for the 
nationals.
One of the new recruits for the 
mens team is freshman Brian 
Zimmerman, who seems quite 
relaxed about the upcoming sea
son. It seems pretty good. Its not 
much different for me. But for the 
rest of the team, theyre working 
a lot harder. Im not sure how the 
competition will be. Zimmerman
Debbie Madsen swimming but
terfly and freestyle, Jo Wollschlaeger swimming IM and 500 
freestyle and Missy Ban Royen 
swimming the 100 and 200 yard 
breaststroke.
Team practices are frequent and 
challenging. Hal Levine revealed, 
This year were following the 
same practices that Kenyon Col
lege did. Kenyon College cur
rently holds the lead for the Divi
sion III. Were in a lot better 
shape this year. Were doing

will probably swim distance races 
such as the 200, 500, and 1000 
yard freestyle.
Junior Tiffany Pickering also 
spoke the same for the womens 
side. Its definitely going to be a 
better season for the women. 
Weve got a lot of good freshmen. 
Some of the new recruits for the 
women include Glynnis Frost 
swimming distance freestyle,
between 6000 to 7000 yards a 
day. Were pretty tired now but 
we know that the work were 
putting in now will benefit us at 
the end of the season.
The team has been quite dedi
cated. According to Fisher. 
Everyones been showing up for 
the practices. Were going to have 
a really good season. Pickering 
states that this year, We have all

and carried the ball back to 
the Case 31. The Tartan 
ground game took over and 
eight plays later produced the 
teams second touchdown of 
the game.
CMU managed one final 
score before the day was over, 
with a little help from the 
Spartans. On third and 18, 
Buda had a pass intercepted 
by Steve Rosiek. However, 
when tackled, Rosiek himself
coughed the ball back up to Car
negie Mellon. The change of pos
session gave the Tartans the 
needed first down to continue their 
drive. Senior Chris Hansen car
ried the ball in from the one to 
close the scoring out at 32-22. It 
was as lineman Russ Hahn pro
claimed, Too little, too late. 
After the game, Coach Lackner 
was already looking forward to 
next year. Were goingto regroup. 
Were going to get bigger, faster, 
and stronger, and were going to
recruit, said Lackner.
Lackner needs to replace 
eight seniors, seven of them 
starters. Most affected are the 
secondary and special teams. 
Both punter Laszlo Buda and 
kicker Jim Kelly are graduat
ing as well as three fourths of 
the secondary: Rob Arthur, 
Gerard Bosch, and Kent Hess. 
They will also lose their lead
ing rusher Chris Hansen, co
captain Terry Graham and 
Tom Denmeade.

the different strokes covered, 
which we didnt have covered last 
year. This year, the team is espe
cially enthused because both the 
womens and mens team have 
divers.
Strokes and speed are not the 
only aspects the team has been 
working on. The team has im
proved on personal relations. The 
result is more perseverance from 
the freshmen, unlike past years, 
and a great deal of team unity. 
Fisher comments, We had up
perclassmen lookingafter the new 
freshmen, making sure every
thing was OK with them outside 
of the practices, academically, and 
adjusting to everything. A kind of 
Big Sister-Little Sister/Big 
Brother-Little Brother program. 
The year we are keeping a lot of 
the freshmen as a result, unlike 
the last couple years where a lot 
of them dropped out.
Hensler added, My freshman 
year, 10 to 15 guys [were fresh
men]. Now Im the only junior left 
from that group.
The entire team is optimistic 
about the season. Hensler said, 
Hopefully well win the PAC 
again and have a stronger show
ing at the UAAs. We should sur
prise a lot of teams that took us 
for granted last year.
Pickering stated confidently, 
Its definitely better than last 
year because of the training, the 
food recruits, and we have a lot 
more depth. We have a higher 
number of top notch people this 
year combining the forces from 
last year and the newcomers. 
Coach Perkins summed up the 
teams feelings by saying, Weve 
had a lot of fun training, were 
ready to have a lot more fun swim
ming meets!
CMU Hockey Club 
starts new season 
without a coach
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Hockey 
Club is looking to have a good 
season this year. After last 
years second place in the 
league, the captains and the 
players are optimistic about the 
talent of the team. The team 
has won their first league game 
against Allegheny, 5-3.
The only real problem that 
the club is encountering this 
year is the lack of a coach. 
H&SS Dean Steven Feinberg 
is serving as the interim coach 
since former coach Bob Coch 
left to pursue a graduate de
gree. Taking up the slack are 
co-captains Mark Robson and 
John Kerber.
The team practices at the ice 
rink in Monroeville since there 
is no other rink close by. How
ever, distance is not a real prob
lem since a club sport practices 
only once a week.
The other rink that the club 
uses is in Kittaning where 
league games are played. The
league includes the University 
Pittsburgh, Slippery Rock, 
Penn State West, West Vir' 
ginia and Allegheny, all of 
which are clubs.
There are approximately 
twenty-five team members in 
the club, but due to course 
workloads, only about 15 
membershave shown up to play  
in most games thus far.
. CMU Hockey has been a long
time club sport. It isnt likely 
that it will become a varsity" 
sport in the near future, be-;_ 
cause of the lack of a nearby* 
arena. There have been pro-: 
posals in the past about build
ing a rink that would be shared 
by Carnegie Mellon, Pitt and 
Duquesne, but action on these 
ideas has yet to make it past 
the discussion stages.
All in all, ifthe coachingsituation gets resolved, it should 
be a good year for the hockey 
club, according to sophomore 
Darin Dunham. He thinks that 0 
the team takes the sport very 
seriously and there is a lot of 
good talent.

them, several players from 8 
Offensive Policy were knocked vv 
to the ground. CGSO quickly  
finished Offensive Policy off 3 
winning the 6-Man Volleyball i

5 in game two.
In IM Major soccer the last ! 
two undefeated teams met. Real 1 
Mellon and KSA were already 
in the playoffs. The game was : 
to see who would get a bye. r 
Both teams started playing con
servatively, testing the other 
sides abilities. Suddenly, two  
Real Mellon players broke down 
the field passing to each other 
as they went. Frank Pfenning <- 
scored with an assist by Gior 
vanni Parmigiani. The half  
ended with Real Mellon up by ' 
two.
KSA came back in the second - 
half and put on some pressure. < 
But Real Mellon held on to win 
the game by a score of 2-1.
