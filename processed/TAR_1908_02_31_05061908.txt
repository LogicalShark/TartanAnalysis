PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MAY 6, 1908TEN CENTS
DR. A. A. HAMMERSCHLAGS FAREWELL ADDRESS 
TO DAY INDUSTRIAL STUDENTS
School of Apprentices and Journeymen, at the Close of Year 1907-1908
I have come here to say a few words of fare
well at the end of the school year to this group of 
students. I want to say it to you in words that 
you can understand and which convey the impres
sion of your faculty. Mr. Connelley will most like
ly address you after I get through, but I have a 
message for you, something I want you to take with 
you.
* * * *
iSome of you students have'been preparing your
selves to enter the School of Applied Science, and 
with, perhaps, a mistaken conception as to your 
capacity and your mental powers. Do not think 
that happiness lies wholly within the grasp of 
those of intellectual height, for many a man with 
limited intelligence and with limited schooling has 
been more successful than the man of great school
ing and of great wealth in the way of the prizes 
of life. Not all those things which are counted in 
material welfare are always within the grasp of 
the scholarly.
Innumerable men come to me having two or 
three degrees acquired in institutions of college 
and university rank who can hardly earn a fair 
living.
They are merely brains wound up that spin 
around just like the works of a watch; they cannot 
do anything else. They can take the most abstract 
subject and toss it up like a juggler tosses the balls 
or the swinging clubs and catches them as they 
dance around without letting them fall before they 
drop. Now there is another kind of intelligence and 
another kind of power which does not have to get 
its great results from an exhaustive study of litera
ture and books; it comes out of a knowledge of man 
and out of the knowledge of things and of the 
knowledge of concrete problems actually solved and 
not of abstract theories going round and round and 
reaching no ultimate conclusion. Now, therefore, I 
want you men as you leave here today at the end 
of your school year, to consider that no other group 
of men is better than you are. If you are at all 
familiar with student life here you know that a 
great many students in the Applied Science have 
succeeded in passing the examination and have 
succeeded in getting through the first weeks work, 
and subsequently have been dropped from low 
scholarship. That low scholarship is not an accusa
tion against the institution but it is an accuusation 
against the pride of the individual who thought he 
had brains and did not have them.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
One of the men to whom we owe most and to 
whom we dedicated this years annual, never was 
inside a college until he had reached manly state, 
he never studied in a college; but I doubt very 
much whether there is in the city today a man of 
as broad intellectual attainments as John A. Brashear. He did not know anything but the little red 
school house that all you boys have been in and 
lelt, but he obtained a distinguished place not only 
in Pittsburgh but in Europe. Another man, Mr. 
William McConway, Chairman of the Committee on 
Technical Schools of the Board of Trustees never 
had the opportunities of a high school education 
and yet last night at a public gathering his address 
to the distinguished visitors was the most remark
able of all.
, * * * *
This world is a very peculiar place and for 
some years the traditions brought over from 
Europe claimed that a man who works with his 
hands is a being to be looked down upon. That 
condition has greatly changed; men who work with 
their hands like John A. Brashear and William 
McConway are beginning to come to their own, they 
are beginning to recognize the value of using all 
the power of the human frame, as well as merely 
the mental powers, as part of the equipment of 
what constitutes a man. 1 want you to hold your 
head up high and when anybody speaks of your 
work in a derogatory way to combat it and teach 
them better, teach them by your manner and your 
logic and your self-control that you are just as 
ably fitted as other students of this institution, be
cause in this small group in this particular depart
ment of the school you have been ably represented 
by candidates which you can well be proud of. 
On the football team and on the baseball team, I 
see among the names, different classes of this school 
represented.
* * * *
I want you to come back; if you have started 
in on a quarter-of-a-mile job finish it, it does not 
make any difference that you are beaten by some
one else, but dont beat down your own inner con
sciousness, and so if you started off to do some
thing, why, go ahead and keep at it; this summer 
you can earn something to enable you to get back 
here and to help lift the burdens off those who are 
helping you to help yourself. Determine to finish 
the thing that you began. Bring your friends back 
with you; by friends I mean the kind of men that

 PLEBES DAY1910 
The Plebes will please remember that during 
the next 10 days they must make one of the momen
tous decisions of their lives. What will I take? is 
what each one in asking himself. Choose well, for 
upon this decision may rest the happiness of the fu
ture.
A few others have left for reasons best known 
at Room 113.
It has been proposed by Mr. Field that it would 
be a good thing for the sections to play base-ball 
games with each other. To make this a fair propo
sition it would be well to follow the new Constitution 
proposed as regards the players eligible. No stu

opening of the class series shall be eligible to his

WUP. WINS THE FIRST GAME BETWEEN THE 
RIVALS.
On Wednesday last the first game between the 
baseball teams of Tech and Wup. took place at 
Exposition Park. The day was not the best that 
could be wished for a game of baseball but the 
first six innings of the game were as snappy as 
any Tech team ever played. The trouble started 
when Bragg, after running three bases at a fast clip 
had to go in and pitch immediately owing to the 
retirement of his side from the bat. In this winded 
condition he could not find the plate and consequent
ly Coach Wolf had to remove him. The other 
pitchers did not seem to be able to do any better, 
but Coach Wolfs action was the only thing left to 
do. All the faults did not lie with the pitchers, 
however, as several very flagrant errors were made, 
including the missing of several flies. The pitch
ing of Weger for Wup. was nothing extra, but if 
the Tech pitchers had done as well the result would 
have been a lot different. The Wup. team played 
a steady game, but it is conceded that, outside of 
the pitching staff, Tech has by Tar the best team 
that she has ever had. If the students would only 
pay an occasional visit to the practice field it would 
help some. On Monday the St. Anthony team came 
over from Troy Hill to give Tech a little practice 
and the small crowd of students present were much 
pleased with the work of the team. Games like 
these will soon put the team on a winning basis,
and we hope that when the next Wup game is
played the score will not be 1G3 in our opponents
favor, but rather in ours.

We are very sorry, girls, but we feel that this 
is as good an opportunity to tell you of our feelings 
in the matter of the representation of the girls 
department in this column as we will have.
The plea that there is nothing doing at the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School is absurd be
cause, if reports be true, the girls have a busy 
time every day. Not a word this week about your 
exhibition last Thursday when the girls made such 
a hit with their cooking, sewing, and other useful 
accomplishments.
Not a word about the Junior Prom, only two 
weeks away which is to be the grand finale of the 
department social functions. Now, really, the boys 
have considerably more than a passing interest in 
your department, and it is up to you to get after 
your editor and see that she keeps the girls de
partment before the eyes of the rest of the school.

THE BOY WHO WINS OUT.p\OSO\O%O\0SOSOSO\O%0S0\O%O%OSO\OSOS
It often happens that a boy gets discouraged be
cause he has had to leave school early in the game 
and feels that there isnt much use in trying to get 
along. Some one may have told him that he doesnt, 
stand any show beside the fellow who has come from 
a college and can figure out the diameter of the sun 
by squinting through a telescope.
There is no denying that education is a good 
thing and none of us ever know too much of the real 
things of life, but we very often get an overdose of 
knowing things that are not so or are of no use to us, 
even if they do no harm. But education and school
ing are not always the same thing, and there are 
many college graduates running a trolley car because 
their learning is not of a kind to bring practical re
turns. They may spout seven languages and have 
culture to burn, but are unable to do any of the prac
tical work of the world better than a thousand other 
men. This may not be the fault of their schooling, 
but it shows that the schooling alone is not a sure 
road to a good position.
Back of everything that helps a boy or a man to 
get, along, either with or without the schooling, is 
the faculty of thinking things out for himself and he 
can do much toward a real education by bearing this 
in mind at all times.
Find out the reasons for such things as come in 
your line of work, why certain gears will cut the 
thread you want, why dead centers are used for 
grinding cylindrical work, and many other things 
that mean something in your practical work. If you 
want, to study the stars for recreation instead of 
reading a good book or going to the theater once in 
a while, there is no harm done if it doesnt interfere 
with your regular work.
The boy or man who succeeds in the shop is the 
one who takes an interest in the work, who isnt 
afraid to work as though he had a financial interest 
in the business and who will learn to think how the 
work is to be done to the best advantage. Experi
ence is a great help if it teaches what to avoid and 
how to apply the knowledge gained in other direc
tions. You can cultivate this quality while at your 
every-day work and it will always be a real benefit 
to you. Whether you are running a bolt-cutter or a 
boring mill there are many things to think about. If 
the dies cut better at one time than another, or bet
ter on one kind of stock than another, you can be 
sure there is a reason. Think it out and w'hen you 
have learned to get the very best results out of the 
bolt-cutter you are worth more to yourself and to the 
proprietor than you were before. You can do this 
without ever seeing a college or using any but The 
faculties you were born with, if you put your mind 
to it.

harm to own one, but neither does it insure a good 
position unless you can back it up by showing that 
you can do certain things better than anyone else or 
better than the average. A first-class man on the 
bolt-cutter is better than an ordinary lathe hand; he 
can get more money and be more su're of steady 
work.
Learn all you can about your trade, by asking 
questions, by careful observation, by reading, and by 
giving it your best thoughts. Remember that it is 
results that count and that it depends on yourself to 
make your services so valuable that a good job is 
always waiting for you.American Machinist.

Dr. J. Stewart Lacock, whose picture appears 
on the cover page of the current number, is a 
graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, class of 
1892. He is one of the most influential and active 
old grads of Penn in this end of the state, and 
it has been in a great measure through his efforts 
that the Mask and Wig Club has been brought to 
Pittsburg. He is a friend of Tech and has been 
largely instrumental in securing the property for 
the new Tech athletic field.

Weather being propitious our new ball park will 
be opened to-day. We are sorry that our original 
opening date with W. & J. had to be canceled as W.
& J. has been seen in action often enough to be a 
popular drawing card with the student body. This 
game, however, will give us a chance to see a Waynesburg team here at home. Although we have met 
teams; from this school before the majority of stu
dents know nothing of them, in fact none except the 
foot-ball team have had any chance to see them at 
all.
The fcot-ball team was able to come home from 
Waynesburg with a victory to their credit last year, 
and it is up to the base-ball team to do as well, es
pecially in view of the fact that this is our first game 
on our home grounds. The team showed that aside
fiom the pitching department they were able to play 
the kind of ball that wins games at our last game 
with W. U. P. The pitchers evidently were not in 
condition, as we know that at least two of the vic
tims of the last slaughter have the goods, as we have 
seen them produce it on former occasions.
Having disposed of the teams duty, just a few 
words to the students in general. The acquisition 
of these grounds has been a considerable item of ex
pense, and its up to us to contribute a part of our 
next years contribution immediately. Up to the 
present writing the student body has failed to respond 
with a unanimity that has equaled on but few occa
sions and surpassed on none. Hoping this will be 
sufficient for a thought starter we refrain from fur
ther comment.

J. H. Taxis, Editor.
The night classes of the School of Applied 
Science, close with this issue.
The writer desires to thank his class mates for 
the excellent support accorded him during the year. 
While never over-worked from the large amount of 
news handed him, yet the moral support during some 
of the trying times has been an incentive to go on.
The approval of the Tartan as a school paper, 
by the entire class, showed the spirit of 1910 as a 
factor in student activities, can always be counted 
on for substantial support.
1910 has about closed a strenuous year; that 
we were equal to four-nights-a-week, and then some, 
is shown by the favorable reports of our instruc
tors. We were fortunate in having men assigned 
us, as instructors, that were both capable and 
earnest .in their departments; their patience and 
cheerfulness in leading us over hard places, explain
ing over and over again, what appeared simple truths 
and their promptness to help with our work, has 
called forth the thanks and gratitude of the entire 
class.
We wish them an enjoyable and deserved vaca
tion and hope at the opening of next year to find 
them as desirous in taking up the work as they 
were of staying with us this year.

for this display of energy are unaccountable, but 
must be extraordinary.

It is expected that this second annual banquet 
will be much better attended than the last one and 
arrangements have been completed for a good even

the most successful student organizations of the 
school and it is up to every student who is in any

it a success.

one day in the school year set aside for their ex
clusive use. The day is given up to student affairs 
of all kinds. In the afternoon, the big feature of the 
daythe Circus comes off. In this show nearly 
every organization in school has some stunt. Fra
ternities clubs, Y. M. C. A. and societies of all sorts 
take a part. The different performances are ar
ranged so as to form a connected whole. A parade 
is started at the University which marches over the 
town like a real Barnum & Bailey production.
Breaking in Gently.
Pardon me, sir, began the portly person in the\railroad train to the man who sat next to him, but 
what would you say if I sat on your hat?
Suppose you sit on it and then ask me, growled 
the other.
I did, admitted the portly person calmly.

Owing to the fact that an intercollegiate field 
meet will be held in Pittsburg under the auspices 
of the Western University of Pennsylvania, the 
baseball game scheduled between that school and 
Tech will be played on Friday, June 5th, at Exposi

be honored at this game and a large crowd is con

APPRENTICS AND JOURNEYMENS BANQUET.
x Social Functions
Last Saturday evening the members of the 
school of Apprentices and Journeymen held their 
annual banquet at the Hotel Henry. It was a suc
cessful affair in every detail and reflects great 
credit upon the committee. Prof. Connelley acted as 
toastmaster and Dr. Hammerschlag was the principal 
speaker. Nearly all of the trade school faculty at
tended and but few students were absent.

Comparing Horses with Steam.
There is a very interesting paragraph in the old 
book by Oliver Evans on steam engines, which was 
published in 1801. In those days much of the power 
for various enterprises was derived from horses, and 
in order to sell steam engines it was necessary to 
compare the engines with the work of the horses, 
with which the prospective customers were familiar.
So in this book we find a rule for this as fol
lows: Multiply the number of horses by 3 and ex
tract the square root of the answer. Multiply this 
by 1.128 and the answer is the diameter of the cyl
inder required for an engine having 3-foot stroke and 
making 36 strokes per minute. The steam pressure 
does not appear in connection with this rule, but is 
presumably considered as being the prevailing pres
sure, which probably did not exceed 10 pounds per 
square inch at that time, although it was only a few 
years later when Oliver Evans himself built engines 
for and advocated the use of 50 to 100 pounds pres
sure.

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
As this is the last issue of the Tartan in which
1911 will be represented for the school year of 1907-
OS, the editor takes the liberty of using the column 
for a few personal remarks.
In the very first place an apology is hereby 
extended to those whom he has made the victims of 
some of his own poor jokes, pointless sarcasm or 
insult.
The class of 1912 with her corps of energetic 
officers was referred to several times in anything 
but complimentary manner, but will it suffice if 
it is said that, there was no malice behind the re
marks?
While the editor of this column feels that 1910 
was the aggressor in the controversy carried on 
in these columns to the amusement (maybe disgust) 
of the whole school, yet, that fact notwithstanding, 
he holds aloft the olive branch of peace and. takes 
this means of wishing his erstwhile enemy a pleasant 
vacation and a continuance of his success next 
fall.
To the patient faculty and particularly those 
who have labored with 1911 in the present school 
year a similar wish is extended; (this will be with
drawn if the Ls, Fs and Ps are not brought up 
to Cs). The executive staff of the class is, with
out exception, grateful for the honor bestowed and 
each hopes that the class is satisfied with the way 
in which the affairs of the class werre handled.
The social committee, of which 1911 may well be 
proud, is still unpaid for the money they advanced 
to meet the deficit incurred at the banquet. The 
shortage is $6.00 and it is possible that a collection 
will be taken to meet this amount.
The athletic committee of which so much was 
expected was perhaps the least active body con
nected with the class. This is dhe to the fact that 
McCulley was a member of the Athletic Association 
and not able to devote enough time to class athletics.

APPLIED DESIGN EXHIBITION.
A new departure in exhibitions of student work 
is to be made in the near future. From. June 1st 
to the 18th Gallery E of the Carnegie Art Galleries 
will be given over to an exhibition of the work of 
the students of Applied Design. The work shown 
will cover the problems and other work of both 
day and night students and will attract considerable 
attention, due to the prominence Tech students have 
attained in competitions during the past year.

The College of Engineering at the University of 
Wisconsin will this year give a summer courrse for 
advanced work for Chemical, Electrical, Hydraulic, 
Mechanical, and Gas and Steam engineers. The en
gineering summer session will be held at the same 
time as the regular university summer session, be
ginning June 20th and continuing until July 31.

SENIORS HOLD A CLASS MEETING.
On Monday the Senior Class was called together 
for the purpose of discussion on some of the points 
of Senior Ball, Senior Banquet, Graduation Exercises, 
and Class Day. 
A Class Day committee was appointed to look 
into 'the matter and arrange a program for the 
exercises as well as to appoint the. speakers. It is 
the idea to have a similar affair to that held at. 
many of the large colleges and that it be held in 
the open air if possible.
The Senior banquet will probably be held on 
Wednesday night after the graduation exercises 
which it is understood will take place during the 
forenoon. The banquet will be restricted to Seniors.
Considerable discussion was held on the advis
ability of admitting the Juniors as individuals to the 
Senior ball when invited by members of the Senior 
class. After a lengthy and heated discussion it 
was voted to restrict this to Seniors and their friends 
out side of school. The question of filling out the 
dance cards previous to the dance also came up, 
but it was decided to allow the members of the 
class to follow their own wishes in the matter.
Another meeting will be held on Friday next 
to hear the reports of committees.
EXHIBITION.
Last Thursday evening marked the third anuual 
public exhibition of the schools and students work 
and despite the inclement weather, between four and 
five thousand people visited the school buildings. 
From 7:30 until 10 a steady stream of humanity 
poured through the various shops and laboratories 
and on every hand nothing but complimentary re
marks on the equipment of the school and the stu
dents work, could be heard. Mr. Hower of the 
physics department had arranged a demonstrataion 
of wireless telegraphy and described it in an inter
esting manner; seats in his lecture room were in 
demand after the word had been passed around 
that the visitors would be treated to this little 
entertainment. Cn the whole the exhibition can 
be said <to have awakened at leasit a part of the 
Pittsburg populace to what is really being done out 
here at Tech.

The Class of 1912 takes this opportunity of ex
tending their heartiest congratulations to the mem
bers of the Senior day class, who are fortunate 
enough to escape the professors ever present Fs 
and Ls. We will be generous enough to even in
clude the fellow who gave us that awful roast 
over the base-ball team.

Butt end first;

Just remember you are facing 
The butt end;

Of course you all know that the Chairman of our 
Athletic Committee is going to spend his summer 
months in Wisconsin. (If you dont it is not Macs 
fault.) Well, MacCowan has been in Wisconsin and 
he liked it so well that he is going back. According 
to his tales that is a very wonderful iState. He de
scribed a cyclone which struck his town once, and 
if he told the truth Chicago can no longer lay claim 
to being the Windy City. This cyclone, as Mack re
lates it, came blowing very gently down the main 
thoroughfare of his town (they always blow gently 
at the beginning, you know) about 6 oclock in the 
evening. It steadily increrased in fury, reaching the 
cyclonic-whirlwind stage in about 45 minutes. About
7 oclock a working man returning home from work,

turned the corner and what did that cyclone do but 
lift him clear off his feet and blow him right down 
the street out over the prairie, and the next seen of 
the man was his entrance into the bar-room of a ho
tel in an adjoining town distant some fifty miles or 
so, the wind having blown him through the weatherboarding of the hotel! And Mac says that he did not 
even bear a scratch!
That friend of Mr. Leetes who knew the three 
greatest liars in the world was evidently not ac
quainted with our Mac.
Does the writer of the article regarding our base
ball team which appeared in a recent Tartan, realize 
that he owes this class an apology? While we com
mend his school spirit, we believe that in this case 
he was a trifle over zealous. The Class of 1912 al
ways has been loyal to the various athletic teams 
and other societies of the school, supporting them in 
a fit manner, and will continue to do so despite the 
doubting Thomases. We believe that had the one 
whose indignation we have aroused used more wis
dom and less haste he would at least have made an 
effort to ascertain the identity of the author of the 
article which so kindled his anger. We know that 
had he investigated a little bit he would not have 
permitted his pen to transcribe such gigantic, un
pronounceable, brain-fagging, and superfluous adjec
tives of indignation.

Did He Refer to Tech?
The Princeton base-ball team was recently told 
by President Roosevelt that President Eliot of Har
vard is wrong on the subject of athletics. The Pres
ident does not believe that discouraging athletics will 
help the institutions. He told the ball players that 
some one wrote him recently asking his advice about 
athletics and the college situation. He said that in 
his reply he advised that more games be won by the 
teams of the institution.
