Bill Ronohoe
One of the greatest running halfbacks in all of the Tartan 
football historyWilliam W. (Bill) Donahoe by namehas 
been signed to be the head football and basketball coach at 
CIT. Bill will come back to the Skibo fold from his present 
position at St. Marys High School in Miami, Florida. His 
record there, though brief, is an enviable one, for his football 
team lost only one game this last season. He will be on campuS 
in time to start spring football practice on April 23rd, the

themesurrealism. The exhibition 
room foyer and the two entrance 
halls of the Fine Arts School will 
be transformed into a wonderland 
by means of lavish decorations 
which will include mannikins and 
huge murals.
The students are being encour
aged to start working on cos
tumes now, for prizes will be 
awarded for the most outstanding 
costume. Another incentive is the 
knowledge that the Beaux Arts 
Society has contacted several na
tionally known magazines.
The committee chairmans are: 
Tom Lakowski, general chairman; 
Scottie Yurchison, business chair
man; Bob Caffry, decoration 
chairman, Harry Ransom, con
struction chairman; Danny Franks,

Contest Open 
To CIT Orators
The Andrew Jackson Oratori
cal Contest supervised by Pro
fessor Goodfellow is a nationwide 
contest sponsored by the Hears t 
Publications. The oration must be 
original, delivered without notes, 
and must not exceed six minutes 
in length. The winner from Car
negie Tech will compete with stu
dents from PGW, Duquesne, and 
Pitt on April 15.
The winner of this meet be
tween the three schools will go 
to Chicago for the Midwestern 
Zone finals on April 24. The 
Grand National Final, which will 
consist of the representatives of 
thirteen cities, will be held in 
Boston on May 2.
The winner of this will receive 
a $1000 Victory Bond. There are 
six prizes being offered for the 
local meet: first prize, $250 in 
Victory Bonds; second, a $100 
bond; third, a $75 bond; fourth, 
a $50 bond; and fifth and sixth, 
a $25 bond.
Entries for contest to determine 
the Tech representative must be 
turned in to Professor Goodfel

Pat Baum
Campus Queen 
Contest Opens
Nominations are now open for 
Spring Carnival Campus Queen. 
Any senior woman may be nom
inated by having a petition sign
ed by twenty students of any col
lege and turned into Miss Orrs 
Office by noon Friday, March 22. 
A picture and pertinent facts 
about the candidates including ac
tivities, honoraries, and factor 
must accompany the petition.
Campus Queen is the highest 
honor that can be bestowed on a 
Tech co-ed; as the name signifies, 
she is the campus queen. She is 
not chosen on beauty alone, al
though she must be more than 
passable in this respect. The cam
pus queen is also chosen on the 
basis of personality, activities, and 
scholarship.
An all-school election will be 
held Friday, March 29 from 11:30 
to 2:00. All students will vote by 
preferential ballot for the court.
The queen will be crowned 
Saturday, May 4 and will pre
side over the big dance on Satur
day. Also she will act in her ca
pacity as queen in making awards 
to pushmobile winners and other 
awards to be made at that time.
Dr. Kerr to Talk
Chapel will be held at 11:30 A. 
M. today in the Fine Arts Thea
ter. The speaker is to be Dr. Hugh 
Thomas Kerr, President of the Al
liance of Reformed Churches of 
the United States and Canada. Dr. 
Kerr was formerly Pastor of the 
Shadyside Presbyterian Church in 
Pittsburgh and one of the two 
representatives of this country at 
a meeting of the World Council of 
Churches at Geneva, Switzerland. 
He will have a great message for 
us, so please plan to come.
One of the big events of the so
cial season this semester will be 
the Shamrock Sham, an informal 
dance, which the Cwens and Sci
mitars are sponsoring. It will be 
held on Saturday, March 16th, 
from 9 to 1 in the Mens Gym. 
The tariff for dancing to the 
smooth music of Bill LeRoy will 
be $1.80 per couple, tax included. 
Ticket booths are set up in Skibo 
during lunch hours this week, and 
all Cwens and Scimitars are sell
ing tickets.
This dance, put on by the wom
ens and mens sophomore honor
aries, is the traditional Soph Hop. 
This year it has a special name in 
honor of St. Patricks Day, which 
is the following day. Last year 
there was no Soph Hop, and the 
year before it was sponsored by 
Cwens entirely. With the reacti
vation of Scimitars this year, the 
dance should have an added im
petus.
Pat Baum, president of the 
Cwens, and Arnie Christenson, 
social chairman of the Scimitars, 
are really putting forth a lot of 
effort to see that the dance is a 
success, and if that isnt enough, 
they can count on the luck of the 
Irish to put it over. Roger Borneman is in charge of the decora
tions, which are going to be very 
special. They will be in keeping 
with the dategreen and white 
and should please anyone from 
Erin itself. So lets all be wear
ing the green on March 16th, at 
the Shamrock Sham. Erin go 
braugh.
Science Honorary 
Holds Interviews
Interviews for Tau Beta Pi, na
tional engineering and science 
honorary, will be held on Sunday, 
March 17th. Juniors in the upper 
8th of their class and seniors in 
the upper 5th will be eligible for 
consideration.
The Advisory Board of the hon
orary held a meeting on Wednes
day afternoon. Matters under dis
cussion were initiation, problems 
arising from the registration of 
transfer students, and the tutor
ing classes being, conducted by the 
fraternity.
The tutoring classes are held on 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday every week at 4:30 
in the mathematics wing on the 
first floor of Industries Hall. 
Classes in physics (E-81) are held 
on Monday, chemistry (E-101, E102) on Tuesday, mathematics
(C-l, C-2, C-2E, C-3E) on Wed
nesday, and physics (E-91, E-91E, 
E-92, E-81) on Thursday. Any 
student desiring tutoring in these 
subjects is invited to join the 
classes, and any group of stu
dents who desire tutoring in any 
technical subject may petition

Mortar Board 
Opens Drive
The American Red Cross Fund 
Drive for 1946 is now in progress 
and will continue until March 19. 
C. I. T. student contributions for 
the Allegheny County Chapter 
are being handled by Mortar 
Board, with the assistance of 
Tech sororities. Each day a dif
ferent organization operates the 
various booths around campus. 
So far, the total contributions 
have been less than $300, which is 
below our quota.
The purpose of this fund is to 
provide for the emergency needs 
and rehabilitation expenses caus
ed by disaster. A recent news let
ter from the local Red Cross 
Chapter states that the number of 
disasters that occur during the 
Spring months is higher than 
those at other times of the year. 
These trying times necessitate 
immediate help for those who lost 
homes and belongings. Now that 
Spring has arrived, the ravages 
of all disasters must be met, and 
there must be a ready reserve for 
aid. It is not too late to do your 
bit to help your neighbor when 
disaster strikes. Give to the Red 
Cross Fund!

About Bill, himself, it is notable 
that it was in basketball that he 
first made an athletic reputation. 
He was one of the outstanding 
stars of the Western Pennsylvania 
scholastic circles at Edgewood 
High School. However, it happen
ed that the longer he stayed at 
Tech, the more he loved and play
ed football. He became a regular 
halfback for the Tartan plaid in 
the season of 24, but he will be 
best remembered for two terrifio 
games in the 26 season, thos* 
against Pitt (which we report with 
no end of glee) and Notre Dame. 
Bill, a good halfback and an all 
but perfect runner, ran wild in 
almost every game of that season, 
but his performance in those two 
games labels him forever in the 
hearts of thousands of Skibo fol
lowers.
Against the mighty Pittsburgh 
Panthers, Bill was not to be denied 
a certain privilegethat of scoring 
both touchdowns in the 14 to 0 de
feat. And again, scoring what 
ranks as one of the greatest up
sets in all intercollegiate football 
history, Bill was the leading ball 
carrier in the 19 to 0 victory over 
the Irish of Notre Dame. Playing 
against the South Bend team, Bill 
scored two touchdowns, but one 
was called back because of an off
side penalty.
Someone said of Bill Donohoe 
that, if he had paid as much at
tention to basketball, while he was 
here in Tech, as he did football, 
lie. would - have ranked as one of 
the Tartans court immortals. His 
football activities called him, how
ever, and he put his whole spirit 
into that sport. Yet, so great was 
his basketball ability that he was 
the tower of strength of the Tech 
courtmen for two years.
Bill was unable to finish his ac
ademic program here a* Tech be
cause of financial difficulties. He

Beaux Arts Society Plans Ball 
For Fine Arts Students Only
In spite of the rumors that there wiU be no Beaux Arts Ball this 
year, the Beaux Arts Society has announced that after a long bitter 
struggle, they have won out and plans are going ahead for the most 
spectacular of Beaux Arts Balls.
This ball, which promises to be an ultra affair, will be held on 
Friday, April 12, 1946, from 9 till 2 in the College of Fine Arts. Maurice 
Spitalny and his well-known orchestra has been engaged to furnish 
the musical background. The ball will be a costume affair and the

Editors Armchair
NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING
This is one of those Sundays that make us wish we werent 
editor of this sad little sheet. In the first place its still spring, 
darn it. Those lovely little warm breezes floating in the office 
window are tempting us either to go for a long walk or to 
take a nice little spring nap. We do not want to write this 
column. In the second place we ought to be writing a paper 
for English, a report for State and Local, and two articles for 
the Thistle. We ought to be home studying for a psych quiz 
*md down at Carnegie looking up a bibliography. We do not 
xvant to write this column. We have not yet discovered the 
administrations unpardonable sin of the week, Student Coun
cil has done nothing horrible, and the student body is not any 
angrier than usual about the lack of a recreation center, 
Saturday classes, or prices in Skibo. We may even have to 
resort to violating a Tartan Tradition by throwing a few 
bouquets from the old armchair.
A FEW GRUMBLES AND MOANS
Well maybe we can scrape up a few gripes. We hear that 
the P and Ds are very bitter because they want to take Layout 
and Design courses in the Printing Department, and they 
simply dont have time for them. The engineers are all taking 
turns jumping off the top of Industries because they have 
quizzes every Saturday morning in those three hour physics 
classes. Then theres the perennial gripe that more outside 
work is required for some of CITs six unit courses than for 
fifteen unit subjects that are supposed to be three times as 
tough. Ginger wishes to register the complaint that since Pika 
and Akip pledged PiKA no one will allow her to enter Skibo 
let alone feed her after she gets in. She claims that its very 
unkind of the students of Carnegie Tech to forget all the 
happy hours of stonethrowing they have spent with her in 
the past. The management at Skibo is probably pretty 
unhappy about all the junk the kiddies throw on the floor 
although they havent complained. If youd stop throwing it 
maybe that little man would stop sweeping under you
COPYING CASEY, BETTER IN THE ORIGINAL
Now for Herrons shouts to the wind. The first goes to 
Student Council. Before they do something ghastly to coun
teract all the good work they have accomplished, we would 
like to go on record with a large pat on the back for the mem
bers, for it is to them that credit should go for getting Techs 
social life back on its feet, for reactivatinghowever ineffi
cientlythe Engineering Class honoraries, and for spurring 
other Carnegie organizations to renewed activity. The fair 
way in which the members have allocated their funds and 
have arbitrated the claims of conflicting campus groups can 
well serve as an example for future Councils. In view of the 
fact that the editors of other college papers are always wailing 
ever the failure of the members of their student governing 
bodies to attend meetings, we think it is quite wonderful that 
our Council never once has had to adjourn for lack of a 
quorum this year. Their stag dances have been quite success
ful too. For once we positively went to thump the adminis
tration on the back for joy. We just realized that they have 
given us all of six days of vacation over Easter. La de da! That 
will postpone our nervous breakdown til our senior year. We 
also think the bosses did a nice job of redecorating in Thistle 
hall. Plaid curtains would be more atmospheric tho. To the 
Tecvets we also want to give a hand for being the only people 
in Pittsburgh who are doing something about the Student 
Veteran housing shortage. The Technical too deserves a few 
commendations for their noble effort they are making in get
ting out their February issue in March instead of some time 
in June or July. Heavens, the rosy glow is getting so thick 
in here its turning red. Wed better stop now or somebody 
might get to feeling complacent.
News from Here and There
The Baylor University Lariat 
reports on a worthy idea. It 
seems as though the week before 
final .examinations is called Dead 
Week, and during this period all 
extra-curricular activity is sup
posed to come to a halt. Profes
sors are not allowed to give quiz
zes covering anything more than 
the last assignment, and everyone 
generally devotes himself to that 
last desperate week. But, as an 
editorial mournfully reports, a 
basketball game, parties, a ban
quet, and last minute tests are 
disrupting the program.
The ebullient Daily Texan 
interviewed an expert to find out 
What makes bobby soxers behave 
that way. An assortment of types 
of love seem to be responsible. 
The crush, which the psychol
ogist terms merely an attachment, 
starts the gamut. The hero-wor
shipping stage follows, and this is 
the one which seems to cause the 
trouble and the Sinatra situa
tion. Unsophisticated juvenile 
love-making! is third, soon to be 
replaced toy romantic love-mak
ing, a stage from %hich recovery 
is highly improbable.
The traditional midwestern 
conservation is again evidenced 
by a snappy column in the In
diana Daily Student, which notes 
wonderingly that a coed skated in 
front of a campus building with
the legs of her red slacks rolled 
up all the way above the knees. 
One wonders what effects a hand
ful of Tech dramats would pro
duce in this Hoosier University.
The University of Akron 
Buchetelite is annoyed. The 
campus smokestack is acting up 
and the editor is furious. He de
mands the use of filters and Rube 
Goldberg as a starter to curb the 
nuisance. Its a DIRTY shame, de
clares the crusader. Apparently 
this one is not worried about the 
price of beanery chow and the 
atomic bomb a la Herron. Down 
with the smokestack!
A Guatemalan instructor at the 
University of Texas informs us 
that at the University of Guate
mala, the students recommend the 
faculty members for their posi
tions. Although this practice is 
quite new, it is working well. In
cidentally, this university has 
been making excellent progress 
since it was freed from rigid gov
ernmental control by the revolu
tion of 1944. The English lan
guage is a popular subject down 
there, indicating a wide interest 
in American affairs. One of the 
greatest troubles so far is the lack 
of technical equipment and a 
shortage of instructors. However, 
this is gradually being remedied;

I would like to register a com
plaint against the present prac
tice of the drivers of the deliv
ery trucks which make daily de
liveries to the Mens Dorms. In
stead of backing around and mak
ing their turns on the driveway, 
they have fallen into the habit 
of driving straight around the 
dorms. This practice is fast turn

in front of Scobell Hall and be

lieve that if the administration 
realized the situation they would 
put a stop to it. Perhaps, if the 
delivery trucks must drive right 
up to the door, the driveway 
could be extended a little fur
ther.
ATOMIC BOMB
The editor of the Tartan re
cently received a letter from Mr.
H. Craig Sutton, Jr., written by 
him for the Editorial Committee 
of the Oak fyidge Engineers and 
Scientists, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 
The text of this letter is as fol
lows:
Dear Editor:
We, a group of scientists and 
engineers at the atomic bomb 
plant at Oak Ridge, are soliciting 
your help , on the most important 
problem the world faces today. 
This is the control of atomic en
ergy. The unanimous opinion of
our group is as follows:
a. There is no secret of the 
atomic bomb. Every country is 
in possession of the basic scien
tific information, and, if any 
country had possession of all of 
the details of our plants and 
processes, the time would not 
be far away until it could 
produce atomic bombs.
b. There is no military defense. 
If atomic war occurs, large 
cities may be wiped out at the 
outbreak of the war. It might 
toe possible that a nation would 
toe devastated without knowing 
the identity of its attacker.
c. Atomic energy should be un
der international control. If the 
United Nations Organization is 
given the task, it should be 
strengthened and allowed to 
operate an international in
spection system to prevent 
atomic armament.
The last point especially should 
receive immediate attention, be
cause, if it is not treated with in
telligent action, each delay brings 
nearer an atomic armament race, 
which would probably have a 
very unfortunate end.
We feel that it is of the utmost 
importance that all of the aspects 
of this issue be brought to the 
public eye by means of publica
tions, forums, and individual and 
group action, so that our govern
ment may be guided in these cru
cial times.
Your college paper is a strong
theoretical sciences is well over 
par.
An executive of the National 
Tube Company, a U. S. Steel Cor
poration subsidiary, has some ex
cellent advice for metallurgical 
engineers. He says that the grad
uates of standard engineering col
leges prove adaptable to the prac
tical phases of steel metallurgy. 
However, students are short on 
such fundamental sciences as 
physics, physical chemistry, ther
modynamics, and mathematics 
higher than elementary calculus. 
Also, the finished metallurgist 
needs a thorough understanding 
of routine analytical chemistry 
and physical testing procedure, as 
well as a knowledge of statistics, 
the ability to handle men, and 
the ability to analyze difficulties 
and conduct research work. The 
demand for metallurgical engi
neers with this type of training is 
growing, for many companies 
have increased their research ap
propriations and are enlarging 
their laboratory facilities. The 
war-induced shortage of engi
neers will also contribute to this 
demand, as the rush of competi
tion forces companies to produce 
better and better products to keep 
and expand their markets.
Policy Association 
Discuss Far East
Two meeting on problems of 
the Far East will be held by the 
Foreign Policy Association dur
ing the early part of March. Mr. 
Edward C. Carter, who is Secre
tary General of the Institute of 
Pacific Relations, will speak on 
Russia, China, and America in 
the Pacific, on Wednesday, 
March 6, in the Frick School 
Auditorium. Mr. Carter is a well 
known expert on such questions 
in this area and has made nine 
tours of investigation to The Far 
East. On Wednesday, March 13,

TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 194TH CARNEGIE TARTAN
Metals Soc. Reorganizes
In a dinner meeting held in the 
Faculty dining room in Skibo, 
Thursday, March 7 th, the Metals 
Society of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology was reorganized by 
the juniors and seniors of the 
Metallurgical Department in co
operation with the members of 
the departmental faculty. This 
Society was formerly one of the 
foremost of the prewar organiza
tions, and its reorganization is 
noted with great interest by all 
present and future metallurgists. 
The acknowledged purpose of the 
Society is to promote the social 
and technical association of the 
students of the department. Ac
cordingly, a program of social 
events and technical meetings is 
being planned with the ultimate 
purpose of affiliating this Society 
with the American Institute of 
Mining and Metallurgical En
gineers.
Events of the evening included 
a talk by Dr. Robert F. Mehl, 
Head erf the Department of Met
allurgical Engineering and the 
Metals Research Laboratory. Dr. 
Mehl spoke briefly regarding the 
activities of the faculty of the 
department during the war, the 
future aims of the department, 
and the activities of the prewar 
metals club. Also on the agenda 
was the presentation and accept
ance of a general plan of action of 
the Society until permanent by
laws can be established. Election 
of officers was held with the fol
lowing results: President, Jay
Meierdirks; Vice-President and 
Treasurer, Fred Harlan; and Sec
retary, George Maley.
As President of the Society, Jay 
Meierdirks appointed Dick Heck
man to serve as Social Chairman, 
and Rolf Weil, Technical Chair
man. The President also present
ed the tentative plan of two tech
nical and two social meetings per 
semester, plus any field trips that 
might be arranged, movies, and 
round table discussions. Dr. Mal
colm F. Havvkes accepted the po
sition as faculty advisor to the So
ciety, and Dr. E. C. Bain of the 
United States Steel Co., former 
industrial sponsor of the Society, 
is to be invited to resume this ca
pacity.
Dormitory Council 
Plans Bagpiper
At the Mens Dormitory Coun
cil last Monday, March 4, it was 
decided that the residents of Mil
ler Hall should have two repre
sentatives to the Dorm Council, 
and the French Officers, residents 
of Engelbrecht Hall, should have 
one representative. These men are 
to be elected before the next reg
ular Mens Dormitory Council 
meeting, March 18. Further pro
vision was made so that the resi
dents of Miller Hall may use the 
lounge and game-room facilities 
of Welch Hall, and the residents 
of Engelbrecht Hall may use Hen
derson Hall. In this way, it is 
felt that no resident of the mens 
dormitories will be denied privi
leges granted to other residents.
George Maley, President of the 
Mens Dormitory Council, ap
pointed his standing committees 
for the semester, chairmen of 
which are as follows: Executive, 
Andy Kuhl; Social, Dick Storm; 
Points and Keys, Bob Brill; Bud
get, Ray Benecki; and Equipment; 
Stan Hyde. The agenda also in
cluded a progress report on the 
Dorm Bagpiper by Tut Hoffman 
to the effect that the Womans 
Dormitory Council will give 
financial support toward the pub
lication of this paper. Some of the 
equipment that belongs to the 
Bagpiper has been located, but if 
anyone has any extra darkroom 
equipment that isnt in use, the 
Bagpiper will be willing to beg, 
borrow, steal, or buy some of this 
type of equipment. Two commit
tee meetings between the Wom
ens Dormitory Council and the 
Mens Dormitory Council have re

Council for the privilege of using

Warm Weather Wows Techites, 
Spring Has Come, or Has It?
Last week Spring barged in 
upon us, as slyly as a boa con
strictor. Amazed and bewildered 
people craned their necks to see 
the signs of a precocious printemps.
Young men were greasing up 
their fancy, so that it might more 
lightly turn.
Bears and porcupines were com
ing out of hibernation. Dr. R. H. 
Coo was seen in the vicinity of the 
Tech campus, in the company of a 
Gobi Desert porcupine.
Berry bushes were sprouting in 
the strawberry ice cream at Skibo.
Streetcars no longer travel in 
convoy. During the winter they 
came only in groups of three, 
probably for protection from some 
terrible monster who wanted to 
eat them. Naturally commuters 
had a long wait between convoys. 
Now the cars feel secure enough 
to travel alone.
Gentle breezes are wafting 
themselves all over the place. 
What with budding trees and the 
newly green grass it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to sit through 
a Soc. Rel. class. Even the Profs 
are in shirt sleeves.
An eager track man is even busy 
pacing through Schenley Park in 
a very abbreviated costume.
One of the great mysteries about 
Spring this year is that it is way 
ahead of schedule. This is the 
season for roaring winds, ugly 
sleet, and floods. Yet we are in 
the midst of a warm, damp spring. 
Government officials are greatly 
concerned about this. A new fed
eral agency, of a highly secret na
ture, is madly hiring meteorolo
gists right and left to investigate 
the causes of the premature spring. 
The causes are believed to be very
ing the West Virginia basketball 
game. The dance, as usual, was 
held under the sponsorship of 
Student Council.
Music was furnished by means 
of records. Thistle Hall looked 
fine after its repainting, and it 
had been well cleaned up since 
last week when some of the re
painting equipment was still 
there. The placing of chairs 
around the walls remedied an 
unfortunate situation which had 
existed the previous week.
The always present service fra
ternity, the A. P. O., sold the re
freshments in the Black Cat. The
A. P. O. has done a fine job this 
year in taking charge of this de
tail at each of the dances.
The West Virginia players were 
invited to the dance, but they had 
to leave without an opportunity 
to visit Thistle Hall.
Welding Society 
Offers Awards
To stimulate interest in under
graduate welding, four annual 
cash awards have been establish
ed through the American Welding 
Society for the authors and pub
lications of the best articles on 
welding.
The A. F. Davis Undergraduate 
Welding Award was established 
by A. F. Davis, vice-president and 
secretary of the Lincoln Electric 
Company of Cleveland, Ohio, for 
the stimulation of undergraduate 
interest in welding. Awards of 
$200.00 to the author of the best 
paper and $150.00 to the author 
of the second best paper plus 
similar awards to the publications 
will be made annually.
The subject matter of the paper 
may be any phase of any type of 
welding or its application to de
sign and construction. Any un
dergraduate of any college, uni
versity, or institute of technology 
in the United States, its posses
sions, or Canada is eligible to 
compete for the award. These 
papers must be published be
tween July 1st of one year and 
July 1st of the succeeding year.
Judging will be based on origi
nality and thoroughness of sub
ject coverage. The Educational 
Committee of the American Weld
ing Society will select a group of 
judges who will make the final 
decision.
The winners of the awards will 
be announced at the Annual Fall 
Meeting of the A.W.S.

subversive ones. Indeed, some go 
so far as to say that the atmos
pheric gremlins are on strike.
Spring is famous in song and 
story for two things, the birds and 
the flowers. Birds pass their time 
twittering and chirping, and hu
man beings who can neither 
twitter nor chirp think this a great 
accomplishment. So they build 
bird houses, and placidly see their 
gardens destroyed all in order to 
say of some shrill voiced opera 
star My, she sings like a bird. 
Flowers are more useful. Dragon 
flowers and skunk cabbage are 
very good for keeping trespassers 
away. Goldenrod gives hay fever 
to kerchooing thousands, and 
thousands of dollars to bland faced 
doctors. Ah, as they say in the 
Pitt School, Isnt spring won
derful.
This will be the first spring 
without flies. Between last year 
and this, the drug stores have in
vented a label called DDT which, 
when pasted on a bottle guaran
tees that the contents will kill 
flies. It seems a shame that such 
an industrious and hardy race as 
flies should be exterminated. What 
will life be without such expres
sions as Shoo fly and Darn,* I 
missed it.
No dissertation on spring is 
quite complete without a word 
about spring fever. When an 
aspiring young engineer sees how 
carefree and happy are the birds 
and the flowers, he thinks What 
the heck and spends his time 
tickling a blue lizard with a blade 
of grass. This is called spring 
fever. Awfully hard on the liz
ards, dont you think? (Ed. 50c 
to the first man who finds me a 
blue lizard.)
The past week found the veter
ans on the campus actively work
ing on the housing situation for 
married vets, preparing for the 
Easter Parade, and expecting 
more reinforcements in the sum
mer term.
The officers of the Tecvets in a 
meeting last Wednesday decided 
to send letters to the representa
tives from Pennsylvania urging 
action on housing bills coming up 
before Congress.
Joe Nutter, Commander of the 
Tecvets, Harry Thor, Vice Com
mander, and Howard Morrison of 
the housing committee presented 
their case to the Mayors office 
which promised them support in 
obtaining an allotment of units 
from the Housing Authority. 
These units will be for married 
veterans on campus. The veter
ans in school will be eligible to 
rent homes from the Housing 
Authority since they are automatially in an income bracket too 
low to permit buying, and since 
they are also ineligible for the

For Sober Skibos
Reactivated Scotch and Soda is 
going to sponsor a snappy review 
as part of Spring Carnival. It will 
be held on Friday, May 4, in the 
Gym.
Scotch and Soda is the annual 
musical that used to be given for 
three successive nights at Syria 
Mosque; next year Scotch and 
Soda hopes to do the same thing. 
To revive interest, this year they 
are presenting a Scotch and Soda, 
slightly dilute. Anyone with ma
terial or an interest in Scotch and 
Soda is urged to see Danny 
Franks.
There will be a contest for a 
musical score and script to be 
used next year. A prize will be 
given, and anyone on campus who 
is interested is urged to submit 
material.

The Housing Authority is 
bringing two-story buildings con
sisting of four apartments from 
Ft. Devens, Massachusetts, for 
erection in various parts of Pitts
burgh. A number of these will be 
allotted to veterans at Carnegie 
Tech.
As a result of an advertisement 
by Tecvets in a Pittsburgh pa
per, six apartments were found 
and disposed of in order of pri
ority. The number desiring apart
ments is still way ahead of the 
supply; more applications are ar
riving at Dr. Wardens office.
The Tecvets social committee is 
working on plans for their Eas
ter Parade, the proceeds of 
which are to be used either for a 
banquet or trip to Pittsburgh for 
a Deshon Hospital soldier, or for 
a memorial fund for Carnegie 
Tech men who died in the war.
One gets some idea of the 
amount of work going on in the 
Veterans Center from the figure 
of 4000 applications received be

of January.

There are also 249 veterans in 
night school.
Three of the veterans here are 
Canadians. They are sponsored by 
the Canadian Governments De
partment of Veterans Affairs 
which has a program similar to 
that of our own Veterans' Admin
istration. Only eleven of the vet
erans are women.
At least as many as the 150 
who entered at the beginning of

freshmen in the summer term. 
These students will continue in

Pittsburgh Savoyards 
Give Princess Ida
The Pittsburgh Savoyards pre
sented the Gilbert and Sullivan 
operetta Princess Ida in the 
Syria Masque last Friday. This 
theatrical group, several of whom 
are Tech graduates, is composed 
of amateurs with dramatic in
clinations who share a common 
love of the works of Gilbert and 
Sullivan. The organization is en
tirely non-profit and serves to en
tertain its producers as much as 
the Pittsburgh theatergoers.
The Princess Ida has rarely 
been presented, for the three 
changes of sets and costumes re
quired make it costly and difficult 
to produce. The plot, of a roman
tic nature, concerns the beautiful 
Princess Ida whose main interest 
in life is her studies. However, 
her father, the king of one king
dom, promised her hand to the 
son of the king of a nearby 
realm. When she declines, the 
young prince decides to take mat
ters in his own hands and win the 
fair lady. Disguised as a woman 
and in the company of a friend, 
he enters the country of his be
loved and proceeds to become in
volved in a long and humorous 
series of adventures before he 
finally wins his suit. The reform 
of a jealous king and a moral 
against the over-education of 
women are added to give the 
story weight and purpose. The 
expert performances of the Sav
oyards, the beautiful costuming, 
and elaborate settings delighted 
the attending operetta lovers.

Chowliound Invades Beaneries; 
Comes Home to Eat at Skibo
A Tartan reporter, impelled by 
the loud chorus of students de
nouncing the Skibo and its prices, 
took a brief excursion last Friday 
afternoon to see how the other 
two-thirds live.
The first of the two-thirds on 
the list was that immense struc
ture in the backyard of Machinery 
HallPitt. The 46 model of the 
Pitt student is dividing his meals 
between the Tuck Shop and an 
Army Style cafeteria. If he or 
she is in a sandwich mood, they 
visit the Tuck Shop and encounter 
a price list on par with the sand
wich list in the Skibo, but the per
son wanting a more substantial 
diet must visit the cafeteria. Here 
the price of a full meal is a 
straight 45 cents which on Friday 
included tomato-rice soup, fried 
perch, parsley potatoes, succotash, 
vegetable salad, bread, apple 
cobbler, and a choice of beverage. 
For 30 cents the meal can be got
ten minus the perch, potatoes and 
succotash. It sounds fine, but 
there is a catch to it. There is 
only one meal served and if the 
cateree does not. like the menu 
well, Gammons is open 24 hours a 
day.
Duquesne University, the other 
third, has its cafeteria in a com
fortable cellar but offers a little 
more variety in menuif one 
doesnt like fish, he can get spa
ghetti. Meals are served a la 
carte, and the complete list of 
Friday specials included fried had
dock, 25 cents; potato soup, 10 
cents; vegetable plate, 30 cents; 
spaghetti, 20 cents; and mashed po
tatoes, 5 cents. Another ten cents 
could be tacked on for a piece of 
pie or cake and a nickel for some
thing to wash down the meal.
Back at Tech, the students were 
enjoying a wide selection of meals. 
It started with baked haddock and 
a vegetable at 50 cents and went 
down to macaroni at 20 cents with 
a few additions of salad, dessert 
and a beverage running up the 
final cost. The Tech student does 
pay a little more each day than 
the students of the other two 
schools, but he also gets a choice 
of meals, not an assembly line 
product.
The Skibo is without peer in 
variety, cleanliness, and atmos
phere. It seems to be the policy 
at Pitt and Duquesne to get out 
of the cafeteria as soon as possi
blethere wasnt a single bridge

Techites make their lunch hour a

ies of college days.
Long lunch lines are not pecu
liar to Tech, either. Other schools 
are having the same trouble. Du
quesne had the shortest and fastest-moving, but Pitt was having 
trouble confining the line to one 
floor. Neither school, though, had 
two lines converging on the 
cashier, and they both put Tech to 
shame on speed.
Yet after observing the other 
college cafeterias and considering 
prices, appearance and operation, 
the Tartan reporter came back 
home for lunch.

TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
This week marks the passing into history of the 1945-46 basketball 
season. While the team only won five of the eighteen games they 
played, they did as well as could be expected all things considered. 
They started out being guys who had never seen each other before and 
who were, for the most part, woefully lacking in experience. Under 
the tutorship of Ed Milchovitch and Max Hannum, they developed fast 
and gave Penn State a real run for its money. Then illness struck, 
people quit, and the coming of a new coach. All of which brought 
about the history which has just come to a close.
W. Va. Gains Rooters
The West Virginia massacre was interesting to watch. The boys 
from the hill country put on a good exhibition. There was a lot of 
color provided by eight rabid rooters sitting up in the stands. The 
octet made things merry all the way through and the cry of Chomp 
em down echoed through the Tech rafters just as it does at every 
West Virginia home game.
C Club To Resume
Another of Techs pre-war groups is trying to make a comeback. 
This one can t miss. Its the C club. Its good to see the
digging the old school spirit out 
of the mothballs again and more 
of this club will undoubtedly be 
heard from.
Well, here it is Spring (after a 
fashion). Tech will be represented 
in athletic circles by tennis, golf, 
and track teams. Also there will be 
football practice. Thats going to 
give us plenty to holler about in 
the coming weeks, but as yet none 
of these is ready to go, so well 
have to hold off comment for a 
while.
Budge-Riggs at Gardens
Speaking of tennis, pre-war net 
calibre returns to Pittsburgh this 
month. In fact, two of the best 
players in the United States to
day are coming to the Gardens 
March 25th. Yes, we mean good! 
Both national champions in their 
day and mainstays of the U. S. 
Davis Cup teams a few years ago. 
We mean Don Budge and Bobby 
Riggs. These two will play a 
singles match and later will team 
with Wayne Sabin and George 
Lott in a doubles match. Tickets 
are on sale now at the Gardens 
and three downtown ticket of
fice.
New Coach
[continued from page 1] 
secured a position as football and 
basketball coach at St. Francis 
College in Loretto, Pennsylvania, 
and received his degree there. He 
stayed at St. Francis for two years 
and then transferred to Pittsburgh 
Central Cathslic High School as 
football and basketball coach. His 
teams at Central were consistently 
successful, and he developed many 
young athletes who later became 
stars at various colleges and uni
versities.
Judge Walter P. Steffan and Bob 
Wrddell, the coaching team 
through the most powerful of the 
Tech teams of the twenties, term
ed Bill Donohoe one of the best 
football backs they had ever seen. 
He has been very highly recom
mended by all who know him, and 
he is capable of giving the Tartans 
that football team towards which 
they have been looking for some 
four or more years. For this sea
son, Athletic Director Clarence 
Overend has arranged a football 
schedule which will pit Tech 
against teams in its own class, thus 
giving the new coach a chance to 
build up from the ground.
At the outbreak of World War
II, Bill was appointed to Officers 
Candidate School and was com
missioned a second lieutenant in 
the 'Anti-Aircraft Artillery. After 
he was honorably discharged in 
1944, he immediately resumed his 
coaching career, receiving an ap
pointment at St . Marys High 
School, where he is now located.
To you, Bill Donohoe, we, the 
members of the Tartan staff, and 
the students of CIT, wish to ex
tend our greetings and best wishes. 
And we want to extend, at the 
same titne, a pledge to youa 
pledge that we will stand with you 
and behind you in what you do 
here at Tech. This next scholastic 
year is the first of, we hope, many 
to come under your athletic guid
ance. Again, good luck.

There will be a very important 
organizational meeting of the 1946 
Carnegie Tech track team in the 
large gymnasium at 4:30 P. M. on 
Thursday, March 14. Guy Halferty, the coach, is anxious to get 
as much practice in as possible be
fore the first meet. Seven men are 
already authorized to draw equip

quickly. All those who signed up 
in the gymnasium office should be 
at this meeting. All others who 
are interested are also invited to 
attend. Practice will start imme

as many good days as possible. 
Carnegie Tech is looking forward 
to a promising year in its first

has come when everyone on the

roll on! The rangy boys from overthe hills brushed aside Carnegies 
feeble attempt to halt their win 
streak, and turned in their 22nd 
victory in 24 attempts this sea
son. The score of Saturdays de
bacle was 81-41, which wasnt of 
much interest to anyone, as the 
whole game was just a matter of 
how high West Virginia would 
run it up.
Tech threw a minor scare into 
the visitors in the opening min
utes of play when Levy and 
Marck pooled a field goal and a 
foul to give the Tartans a 3-2 lead, 
but this was short-lived as Car
roll, the visitors star forward, 
dropped a foul and Byrd, the big 
center followed with three points 
of his own and the Mounties were 
on their merry way.
W. Va. Pulls Ahead
The boys from the hills put on 
quite an exhibition in the use of 
the fast break and constantly got 
down the floor with the ball be
fore Tech could get its defense set 
up. Tom Laverte got loose twice in 
a row on fast breaks to make the 
score 10-4, after which George 
Marck came through with two 
foul tosses only to have them can
celed by one of Carrolls Specials 
the overhead pop shot from the 
side of the court. Again the 
Mountaineers used their advantage 
in height to grab the ball from 
the boards and get it down the 
floor in a hurry with Laverte 
swishing two more in a row. At 
this point, Howie Levy took over 
the task for Tech and came 
through with two field goals and 
a foul to give the floundering Tar
tan quint a shot in the arm and 
make the score West Va. 21, Tech
11 at the quarter.
Tech Routed
The visitors stepped out farther
the student body in general. A lit
tle louder cheering, a little more 
interest in the practicing of the 
squads, all will tend to let the 
new coach know the Techites are 
behind him. It is hard enough to 
coach a team with the support of 
the students, much less having to 
fight them. Heres hoping that 
there will be a good turnout for 
the squad, and that Tech will 
have a very successful season this 
fall. There are many potentially 
good players on campus, so heres 
hoping they, and everyone gets 
behind the coach.
W.A.A. Asks All 
Girls To Turn In 
Hours For Awards
The W.A.A. Board is asking all 
girls who think they will get 
awards before May to hand in 
their names and the number of 
hours they already have earned to 
any of the following Board mem
bers: Franes Quill, Ruth Flana
gan, Imogene Grove, Martha Sant, 
Audrey Wilkins, Joan Lowe, Peggy 
Brown, Shirley Turner, and Libby 
Segal. The Board would like to 
make plans for the Awards Ban
quet and needs the number of girls 
expecting awards.
Next Thursday night, March 21, 
the W.A.A. basketball team is 
playing P.C.W. The team will be 
picked from those with the most 
practice hours. Spectators are 
welcome to attend.
In the last article on the Wom
ens Athletic Association, there 
were two sports omitted from the 
list of those recognized by W.A.A. 
They are shuffleboard and fencing. 
The complete list is as follows: 
basketball, volleyball, contempor
ary dance, badminton, tennis, ta
ble tennis, swimming, hockey, 
mushball, riding, archery, bowling, 
shuffleboard, and fencing.
All women are eligible for par
ticipation in the W.A.A. Unsched
uled hours should be signed up on 
the list posted on the board in the 
gym locker room. Individual rec
ords should be kept as a double 
check. Thirty hours win numer
als; 60 more, a sweater; and 30 
more a C. This is a total of 90 
hours for a sweater and 120 for a 
letter. These hours should be 
spaced so that at least 50% of 
them are in scheduled activities.
At present scheduled activities 
include Dance Club, gym classes, 
badminton tournament, and bas
ketball. Basketball practices are 
Wednesdays at 3:30 and Fridays 
at 4:30.
in the second period as they rang 
the bell consistently with almost 
every shot in the books. Carroll 
and Laverte took up where they 
had left off and gave the visitors 
four more points as the second 
stanza opened. Marty Chetlin got 
loose under the hoop for Tech, to 
score a lay-up and George Meyer, 
who was playing a whale of a 
game under the boards for the 
Tartans, dropped a free toss. But 
Carroll sank another of his spec
ialties from far out and Shreve 
hooked another two points into 
the cords for the Mounties. That 
made it 30-14, but Tech was still 
doing its best and Levy and Bernie 
Watson came through with three 
points for the home team, and 
after two West Va. field goals, Lew 
Heiles dropped a long set shot. The 
visitors came right back with 
more points of their own and 
walked off the floor at half time 
with a 38-22 lead.
W. Va. Runs Amuck
The second half was much like 
the first with the visitors dominat
ing the play so much that it made 
the game boring. Tech couldnt 
find the range for a while and the 
Mounties had 6 points in the third 
period before Tech could score a 
foul shot. Watson and Meyer put 
up a good battle under the back
boards for Tech but West Va. 
scored almost every time they got 
their hands on the ball and rolled 
up a 57-29 advantage at the threequarter mark.
40 Points Lead!
The Mountaineers looked like 
they were just warming up as the 
final period rolled around. The 
second team was in, but it, too, 
found no difficulty denting the 
cords and poured through 24 
points in the final ten minutes. 
All of which made the final score 
81-41.
Sidelights on the game: Both
teams finished their regular sea
sons Saturday, but West Virginia 
by virtue of its outstanding rec
ord this season, heads for Madison 
Square Garden this week to play 
some post-season games against 
the best in the country.
The game was enlivened con
siderably by a staunch rooting 
section of eight male Techites who 
had something to say to almost 
everyone present. Even the refs, 
Walt Ketchell and A1 Wash got 
a kick out of its and at times were 
seen to smile at some of the 
cracks directed at them.
When the game started, all eyes 
were on Carroll. He didnt waste 
any time proving to the crowd 
that he has that overhead shot 
down to a science as he dropped 
a long one in the opening seconds.
The game brought to a close the 
doings of the Fearless Five for the 
current season and the ledger 
shows 5 wins in 18 tries for the 
Skibos. Lineups:

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 12, 1946
One of the Boys
It must have been a cold Janu
ary day in 1926 when Ben 
Schwartz was born. Not that there 
is anything cold about Ben (who 
is constantly trying to live up to 
his middle name of Lover); but 
since most January days are rather
Ben Schwartz
frosty, I think the inference is 
probably correct.
Ben grew up in the quaint lit
tle suburb of Brookline where he 
was graduated first in his high 
school class. At the same time he 
came in second in the Pittsburgh 
Civic Contest.
Though he held two Tech schol
arships, the Navy was no respector 
of such trivial formalities. So 
though Ben entered Tech in May 
43, he left the very next month. 
While in V-12 at M.I.T. it should 
do loyal Tech hearts good to know 
that he came up with the follow
ing profound thought. The M.I.T. 
undergraduate school isnt as good 
as the C.I.T. undergraduate 
school. Bens Navy career was 
cut short when he hurt his 
shoulder, at swimming of all 
things, so they gave him the best 
Christmas present they coulda 
discharge on December 23, 1943.
He entered school again ten days 
later and has been here ever since. 
On February 3rd, graduating first 
in his class, he received his B.S. 
in Electrical Engineering; in June 
1947 he hopes to get his M.S. in 
mathematics. At the present time 
he is both teaching and going to 
graduate school.
Ben has had very few activiSweepstakes

crew streak across the finish line, 
victors in the first running of 
what was to become one of the 
permanent features of Spring 
Carnival, the interfraternity 
sweepstakes.
In 1921, Iota Delta was declar
ed winner. It was in 21 that the 
frats went in for design in a big 
way. Sigma Nus had a replica of 
the Toonerville Trolley, an
other house had an Interurban 
the design winner had a fish 
shape.
The following year, 1922, Pi 
Kappa Alpha and Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon tied for first place in a 
field of twenty. Alpha Kappa Psi 
sorority crashed the sweepstakes 
this year, but wrecked in the race.
In 1923 pushing crews were in
creased from one to four men. 
Freak designs were sacrificed for 
speed and durability. Kappa Sig
ma took the event this year.
Kappa Sigma repeated in 24 
and 25, but Pi Kappa Alpha skin
ned them out in '26.
The Kappa Sigs came back 
again to take top laurels in both 
27 and 28. Pi Kappa Alpha again 
nosed them out over a new course 
in 29.
Winners for the ensuing years 
were: 1930, Beta Theta Pi; 1931, 
Delta Tau Delta; 1932 and 1933, 
Beta Theta Pi; 1934, Kappa Sig
ma; 1935 Beta Theta Pi. Then the 
amazing Kappa Sig buggy did 
the incredible in taking the tro
phy for six years running, cross
ing the finish line first each year 
from 1936 to 1941. There have been 
no sweepstakes races since that 
year, and this year will mark the 
resumption of competition on a 
grand scale.
ties on campus. Besides being a 
member and past vice-president 
of Tau Delta Phi the following 
honoraries also have him as a 
member: Theta Tau, of which he 
was regent; Tau Beta Pi, Eta 
Kappa Nu, Phi Kappa Phi, and 
Alpha Phi Omega. He is also 
vice-president of Interhonorary 
Council, a member of A.I.E.E., 
E.S.W.P., and I.R.E., he was in 
the orchestra (as a fiddler), in the 
Glee Club, and is now managing 
editor of the Technical and assist
ant news editor of the Tartan. He 
is also a charter member of Tecvets.
In his spare timeeven with 
all the activities and an average 
factor of 3.6, Ben has an immense 
amount Of spare timehe is at 
Skibo continually playing bridge. 
To those people who think that 
good bridge players are born not 
made, Ben is THE example to 
prove that they are wrong. All 
the bridge he knows he claims he 
learned at Tech. After watching 
him play, I have come to the con
clusion that if I had a photo
graphic meipiory and a mathe
maticians mind Id be able to 
play bridge just as well.
Aside from a passionate inter
est in the aforementioned game 
and in chess, Bens chief hobby 
seems to be vector analysis. (Ed. 
He talks about it all the time.) 
He feels it is the coming field in 
mathematics, and it is in this that 
he wants to do research. (For 
those Techites who do not know 
what vectors are I will enlighten 
you. A vector is a line with an 
arrow on the end. Since this 
seems so simple I dont see how 
research could be done unless per-* 
haps Ben intends to discover a 
new way to make arrowheads.)
According to his fraternity 
brothers, Ben is quiet, very slop
py, and occasionally absent-mind
ed. According to one member, he 
is also of vast assistance to those 
of his frat who are less well en
dowed with ability and brains; he 
also can solve complicated prob
lems mentally.
Ben has three very firm opinions 
about Tech. They are: 1.) He
thinks that there should be a canContributors Honor

FRAT FLASHES
By B. J. Kreimer
If it werent for the coming 
mid-semester exams, wed all be 
occupying our minds with Easter 
vacation. But, instead we go 
around worrying and wondering 
what to do next. At least the frats 
and sororities show signs of ac
tivity what with elections, initia
tions, and dances.
The D. G.s elected M. M. Gan
non as their new President, Jean 
Price, Vice President, and Bar
bara Ebaugh, Treasurer.
At their last meeting tihe Chi 
Os also held elections. Their new 
President is Esther Haushalter; 
Vice President, Dotty Hallas; Sec
retary, Marie Falkenhagen; Treas
urer, Ada Bucy. (Congratulations 
and stuff!)
The new Kappa officers are: 
Mary Keefer, President; Betty 
Kane, Standards; Jean Lisle, 
Treasurer.
Friday night the Delts from 
W. & J. held their initiation in 
conjunction with the Tech Delts 
at 5020 Morewood PI. Ray Stehle 
became a brother in the Tech 
chapter. Following the initiation 
ceremony, the boys had a dinner 
and dance at the house.
All (the Pi K As who parted 
with pins or announced their en
gagements sponsored a beer party 
at the fraternity house Friday 
night. (The question is, does it 
pay?)
The D Us gave a Tea Dance 
and Dinner for the Kappas last 
Wednesday.
In appreciation of the wonder
ful time the Delts had at the Kap
pa Dance they sent Orchids to 
the Kappas ... It seems there 
was quite an argument about 
whod be allowed to wear them, 
but finally Rickey Murray and 
Mary Keefer won out, because 
they are Social Chairman and 
new President, respectively.
Monday afternoon tihe Betas 
gave a tea dance at the Beta 
House. The Kappas were their 
guests.
The girls in Linden Hall threw 
a Sweater and Sox' party for the 
T Xs Friday night. All shoes 
were removed at the Door (Dutch 
fashion) and the first few dances 
were done in stocking feet.
Friday, March 8, the Rev. How
ard Scharfe, pastor of Shadyside 
Presbyterian Church, led a re
ligious discussion at the Theta Xi 
fraternity house.
Saturday, March 9, the S A Es 
celebrated their 90th anniversary
at the University Club. The gath
ering was sponsored by the Pitts
burgh Alumni Corporation. Mem
bers from both Pitt and Tech at
tended.
Mary Vincent has taken over 
Audrey Ransoms job as President 
of Delta Delta Delta. Jean 
Streicher was elected to fin 
Marys old job of Pledge-Trainer. 
They will hold office until the 
new officers are installed in April.
The S A Es recently purchased 
a plaque in honor of their mem
bers who made the supreme sacri
fice. The S A Es brothers who 
died in World War II were Rod
man T. Breene 44 and Charles 
Miskevis 38.
There was an informal dance 
at the S A E house Friday night. 
The girls all wore skirts and 
sweaters.
Keep your chins up everyone, 
these exams cant occupy all our 
time.
Clan Holds Bridge
For the past eight issues weve 
been reporting the renewal of 
pre-war customs and this week is 
no exception. On Saturday, Feb
ruary 9th the Womens Clan held 
their first bridge since the begin
ning of the war. (In Thistle Hall.)
Mrs. Herbert Graham was 
chairman of the bridge which was 
held for the Senior Scholarship 
Fund. Door prizes were awarded 
and the turn out was gratifying to 
all concerned.  Another para
graph has been written in the 
back to dear old Tech chapter.
Dr. H. Karn Becomes 
Psychology Professor
The latest addition to Carnegie 
Techs teaching staff is Dr. Harry 
W. Karn, who has joined as an

Pfc. James Taylor 
Sings in Glee Club
With the appearance of the vast 
number of vets on the campus, one 
would certainly be led to believe 
that Carnegies contribution to the 
war effort is at an end. The situ
ation is far from this apparent 
view. Techs sons are still situ
ated in all parts of the globe car
rying on where others left off. One 
of these is Pfc. James I. Taylor.

was affiliated with the 42nd 
(Rainbow) Division and partici

Electrical Engineers 
Give Humorous Play
Last Tuesday at 10:30, the lo
cal branch of the AIEE-IRE offer
ed something new and different 
a super-duper play in the Studio 
Theater. The rather prosaicsounding subject How to Give a 
Seminar Paper was really en
livened by varied and sundry stu
dents of the Electrical Depart
ment in their roles of actors-fora-day. If there had been music, 
it might have been called a musi
cal comedy. As it was, the thing 
defied definitionprobably being 
closer to an Olsen and Johnson 
effort than anything else.
After the dramatics the second 
edition of the student depart
mental paper made its appear
ance. The Tartan has competi

IRC Discusses Franco
At their meeting this Tuesday, 
March 12, at 4:30 in Room 104 
Margaret Morrison, the Interna
tional Relations Club will discuss 
Should Franco Be Ousted?
This touchy question has been 
the subject of much bickering 
among the Big Three, and our 
recent ambassador to that warravaged land, Dr. Carlson Hayes, 
was the topic of much pro and 
cn criticism for his actions in 
Spain when he returned to the 
United States. A good many of 
the American people seem to 
favor the elimination of dictator 
Franco, but several powerful fac
tions here are supporting him. 
The proponents of these points of 
view will contest and compare 
them at the coming meeting.

Poor Attendance Curtails 
Eve. School Social Affairs
Several evening students have 
asked me when the next social 
affair of the Evening Student 
Council would occur. In a sense 
I was glad to have that question 
raised because it showed that there 
was an interest in the activities 
promoted, but at the same time, 
sorry to have to give the unfor
tunate answer that there are no 
more affairs scheduled for the 
semester.
Why, you ask? The answer has 
been very obvious at the recent 
functions; an affair of any real 
success requires attendance, and 
attendance has been conspicuously 
absent from the social affairs of 
the year.
It doesnt appear fair to those 
who have loyally supported these 
functions, but there are always 
cases of the zealous suffering un
deservedly from the disinterested.
It is also unjust to the few of 
the Student Council who have 
worked hard in their rare spare 
moments to plan, decorate, exe
cute, and clean-up for each of 
the various dances, parties, and 
get-togethers. There is a great 
deal of work involved in each of 
these social activities as anyone 
has been elected to these duties 
will attest. Therefore the results 
have not merited more unfruitful 
interest for this semester.
You who read the Plaid should 
consider the setback very serious
ly. Although next fall activities 
will again resume their schedule, 
the outcome will be the same if 
there is no more interest shown 
than has thus far been demon
strated.
In other words, the Plaid is 
bawling you out nicely, of course, 
but still reprimanding you for 
non-support. You regular at
tendees should talk with your 
friends and classmates and do a 
little promoting for yourself. You 
who are new to the campus and 
the Plaid and uninitiated into the 
Evening School activities should 
heed this.
In the past the Evening School 
dances and parties have been 
looked-for events with a good at
tendance, a nice crowd of people 
and even a few day-school follow
ers. Each was a calm, enjoyable 
affair, with people of your indi
vidual interests and agesall 
ages.
There is no reason why the fu
ture events could not improve 
upon the past events. Although 
this is not meant as a call for 
workers, that is one way to aid the 
situation. The basic request of 
the editorial is for  each of you 
who are interested or even mildly 
aroused to stimulate a little curi
osity and intrigue concerning these 
functions. There are quite a few 
old-timers in the classes who 
could attest to the good times they 
had. Come out. Youve no idea 
what youre missing!

Nothing like an Indian-giver

seems to me a few gals might 
liven up the place.

Ches Biscup and Fred Vichich

were looking over the crowd try

Who were the two males who 
hung around two sleek Plaid staff 
members? We cant find out if 
they were escorted home, or didnt 
they make the grade?
We can understand when some
one like Aga Kahn lets himself 
get as heavy as a ton of diamonds, 
but why does a certain gent we 
know allow himself to get so ro
tund? Chester was going to the 
backroom, but she came to him.

Newton couldnt have had half 
the trouble discovering calculus 
that some of the engineers have 
learning it. Just ask me, Im in

me with an excellent opportunity 
to bow out.
Banquet Tickets
Tickets are now on sale for the 
Engineers Banquet to be held in 
the Roosevelt Hotel, April 27. Full

souvenirs, what more could you 
want for $3.00? Additional tickets 
may be obtained from ^Frank 
Mihelich and Mr.' McKelway. Be 
sure and obtain yours early be
cause they go like hotcakes. This 
is really the affair of the year. 
(The engineers tell us) And may
be you will win the doorprize. I 
wonder if they give away one of 
those lovely entertainers as this 
prize. Dont forget to see Frank or 
Mr. McKelway for that ticket.

Interviewing
Heres a lucky person, for he is 
one of the few fortunate veterans 
able to get an apartment in rea
sonable distance from Techs cam
pus. This makes. it very con
venient for Bob Todd and his wife, 
for their home town is Belle Ver
non, and from there it would be 
quite a chore to come to class each 
day. You see, Bob is a day stu
dent here at Tech as' well as an 
evening student. He attends even
ing classes three nights a week, 
studying Engineering Drawing. In 
this his second semester, he is 
studying to be a Chemical Engi
neer.
Now for a brief description, Bob 
is 5 feet 8% inches in height, 
(quite exact); he has brown hair 
and brown eyes. He has a very 
pleasing smile, and a grand sense 
of humor, which accounts for him 
having many friends here on cam
pus.
Bob served four years in the 
Army Air Corps on the Mandate 
Islands in the Pacific. He didnt 
care to discuss too much on this 
subject, and we cant blame him 
one bit.
His present hobby is photogra
phy. A few years ago, odd as it 
may seem, his hobby was hunting 
for places where they sold a good 
dish of spaghetti. At that time, 
if you felt like eating a delicious 
dish of it, the way it should be 
made, Bob could hand you a list 
of places where it could be ob
tained. Hearing this, of course, 
we came to the conclusion that his 
favorite dish was none other than, 
yes, spaghetti.
When it comes to sports, its 
swimming and tennis that heads 
the list. Well put our money 
down on him any day as being the 
champ.
Bob is a graduate of California 
State Teachers College, and taught 
for awhile at the Belle Vernon 
Junior High.
Bob was very nice in submitting 
to this interview, and we finished 
just in time to let him go off to 
work with his T-square and tri
angles. Thank you, Bob, and 
heres wishing you loads of suc
cess.

Book Browsing By 
Our Literary Ed.
Daphne Du Mauriers The 
Kings General, a recent selection 
by the Literary Guild, is a book 
which will satisfy the reader who 
is in the mood for a light tale of 
the undying love of a maid for the 
handsome kings general in the 
West of England.
Honesty, the heroine of the 
story, is crippled shortly after she 
meets Richard Grenville, the hero. 
The following story unfolds about 
the English Revolution and Hon
estys traveling between the Eng
lish estate of her family and that 
of her relations to avoid direct 
contact with the fighting of the 
Revolutionists and Royalist forces. 
Richard in the course of the book 
has an unsuccessful marriage and 
career. As the Kings General he 
has little or no support from the 
people under him excepting those 
in his army. From these men he 
receives devotion and respect. 
Throughout the story both the 
problems of Richard and Honesty 
form most of the intricate detail. 
Their meetings help to break the 
monotony and tenseness of a his
toric novel dealing with the in
ternal wars of one country.
The book is basically an enjoy
able one with enough historic de
tails to keep it from going com
pletely into the unreal. The read
er who starts a book to find a flaw 
in it will have his hey-day here as 
there is much to break down in 
this work. The Kings General 
is the book for him who likes his 
easy chair, fireside, and a light, 
romantic novel on a rainy even
ing.
March 17-Thats 
St. Patricks Day
Each year as St. Patricks Day 
approaches, I find myself asking 
the same old question, Just how 
did St. Patrick free Ireland of all 
the snakes? Sounds rather naive, 
doesnt it? But honestly that is 
as limited as my knowledge of St. 
Patrick was until today. I finally 
decided to settle once and for all 
the question thats been needling 
me for ages. (I only look old.)
I hope this article doesnt bring 
down the wrath of the Irish on me 
for like most backwoodsmen, I 
only know what I read in the en
cyclopedia.
First, who was St. Patrick? 
After digging through a few vol
umes of text (honestly they were 
three inches thick), I came to the 
conclusion that he was a son of 
the deacon Calpurnius (a decurir 
or magistrate of Nemthur, a pro
vince of Ireland).
It seems that as a lad of fifteen, 
he was carried off (today we call 
it kidnapping) and sold as a slave 
in the territory of the Irish Piets 
called Dal Araide. While in cap
tivity, he devoted much time to 
meditation. After spending six 
years in this manner, he finally 
found a way to escape and by this 
time he had decided to devote the 
rest of his life to teaching of 
Christianity. He appears to have 
gone somewhere for a few years 
to prepare himself for the priest
hood. His biographers take him to 
Tours and afterward to the Island 
of Lerins in the Mediterranean and 
lastly to Rome, where he received 
a mission from Pope Celestine.
Patrick tells us that after a few 
years, (after his escape) he was 
among the Britons with his 
kindred who received him as a 
son. He was only forty-five years 
old when made a bishop. His life 
was solely devoted to prayers, 
mediation, and teaching. The date 
of St. Patricks death is uncertain. 
Some authorities agree on the year 
471 A. D., after a reign of thirtysix years.
After thumbing through pages 
and pages, all I know about St. 
Patrick and the snakes is what I 
started withnil.
So I guess come next St. Pat
ricks day, Ill be asking myself 
the same old question.
