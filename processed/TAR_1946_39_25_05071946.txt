Sweepstakes Notice
The sweepstakes finals will 
be held at two oclock on Sat
urday. Spectators are request
ed to keep off the finish line 
and the course. All cars must 
be removed from the streets 
over which the race is run by 
12:00 noon. Any which are not 
moved by then will be towed 
away by the police.
Kappa Sigs, Delts, 
And Pi KAs Win 
Buggy Preliminary
In the preliminary heats of the 
buggy races, the Kappa Sigs came 
in first with the time of 3 min. 
24.5 sec.; the Delts rounded out 
the course in 3 min. 25.1 sec. for 
2nd place and the Pi KAs placed 
third with a 3 min. 26.3 sec. run. 
If the Kappa Sigs win the finals 
which are to be held Saturday at
2 P. M., it will be the 7th year 
that their buggy has won.
The Betas won the design award 
with their bug shaped buggy of 
welded tubular steel. The judges 
based their award on a balance 
between appearance and engineer
ing features. Although the Pi K A 
buggy made a better appearance, 
structurally the Beta buggy, which 
was designed by Rick Saxton, was 
a natural for the award.
The preliminaries were run off 
in 3 heats. The PiKAs, Delts, and 
Kappa Sigs were in the first race; 
the Betas, S.A.E.s and D.U.s in 
the second; and Scobel, the Phi 
Kaps, and the Theta Xis were in 
the third. The bubble canopied 
buggy of the Tau Delts could not 
participate in the races due to a 
broken rear wheel axle. The D.U., 
Phi Kap, and Scobel entries were 
disqualified because the pushers 
at the final change shoved the 
buggy into the last zone instead

Students Enjoy Spring Carnivals 
Exciting and Varied Program
Honoraries Call 
New Members
The annual Call Day exercises 
were held in conjunction with the 
coronation of the Campus Queen 
on Saturday morning in the Mens 
Gymnasium. Originally planned 
for the Sylvan Theater, the exer
cises were moved indoors as a re
sult of bad weather.
Queen Anne Stansbury, after re
ceiving her crown and scepter and 
being officially elevated to her pre
siding position, called on the presi
dent of each honorary to make 
their call. In most cases the new 
members came forward and filed 
across the stage.
The first honorary to make its 
call was the journalistic honorary,

Dilute S & S Goes Over Strong
The eagerly-awaited Spring Carnival got under way Fri
day afternoon, May 3, at 5 oclock with the buggy races in
front of Margaret Morrison. At eight oclock that evening 
Scotch and Soda took over with their musical revue, Take It 
From Here. The show was followed by an informal dance in 
Thistle Hall.
The informal dance on Friday night was very well at
tended despite the fact that the. carnival booths were open on
the cut. Dancing to the music of
Joey Sims lasted until 1 oclock.
Most of the dancers divided their 
time between Thistle Hall and
the cut, so the crowd was con
stantly moving.
The booths and rides were
sponsored this year by Omicron
Delta Kappa, senior mens hon
orary, through the Spring Carnival 
Committee. Profits will go to the 
Endowment Fund. Refreshment 
booths were taken care of by both 
the D. G.s with their Anchor Inn, 
and the Thetas with the refresh
ment booth in Thistle Hall. The 
Tri-Delts had a fortune-telling 
booth, and the Kappas had a bet
ting booth featuring a white 
mouse. The Chi Omegas had 
charge of the ferris wheel. Phi 
Kaps had a nail-hitting booth, the 
Pi KAs had a ball-throwing booth, 
and the Beta Sigs had a dart game 
with certain profs as target. 
Other game booths were handled 
by the SAEs, TXs, Sigma Kaps, 
Delts, Tau Delts, and Citcom. The 
DUs ran the bingo booth. The 
trade at the booths was good, con
sidering the fact that the bad 
weather kept away most of the 
outside-Tech customers.
George Olsen furnished the mu
sic for the semi-formal dance held 
in the gym on Saturday night. An 
enthusiastic crowd completely fill
ed the gym, with many overflow
ing into Thistle Hall for refresh
ments. The elaborate decorations 
carried out a spring theme with a 
fountain in the center and park 
benches and spring murals around 
the dance floor.

Representatives of almost all the 
colleges and universities which 
have adequate facilities for hand
ling foreign students, attended the 
convention to discuss vital ques
tions raised by the desire of those 
students to be admitted to colleges 
in the United States.
There are two common methods 
by which foreign students may 
enter the United States in order 
to further their education. The 
prospective student may first ap
ply to his consular service for a 
visa. If he desires to obtain a' 
student visa, for which there is no 
limiting quota, he must show a 
certificate of admittance to a 
school here in the States. He may 
also obtain a regular visitors visa, 
especially if he is financing his 
own education rather than being 
selected for government sponsor
ship. The student chosen by the 
government has his expenses paid 
and is given a subsistance allow
ance. In some colleges the frater
nities and sororities are providing 
the foreign student with board 
without cost to the student. An
other method of entering the Unit
ed States is by the system of ex
changing students. France and 
Switzerland have stated that they

Last Friday nights revival of 
Scotch and Soda was a production 
which did credit to the tradition 
of Scotch and Soda. Take It From 
Here was presented at eight 
oclock in the Mens Gymnasium 
to a crowd of twelve hundred peo
ple all of whom enjoyed them
selves immensly. They laughed to 
the tune of Dave (Bob Hope) 
Crantzs patter and skits by Ernie 
Motyl, Dave Crantz, and A1 Checco. Costumes designed by Louis 
Knaak were worthy of a techni
color movie production.
The program opened with an 
overture by Jay Maratta and his 
band consisting of three songs: 
Anything Goes, Love Is Sweeping 
The Country and Working Our 
Way Through College, with the chorus dancing and singing Any
thing Goe*. Dave Crantz followed
this with his patter in the style 
of Bob Hope. Ann Stansbury 
(Queenie), Pat Falkenhain, and 
Lucy Seibert presented a paid ad
vertisement for Dr. Jekyls Jump
ing Beans. This little ditty went 
to the effect that Fitehs might be 
good for the hair, Bayers for your 
head and Pepsodent for your teeth 
but Jr. Jekyls Jumping Beans are 
good for everything. They will 
grow hair on a billard ball or on 
Dr. Gregg.
The two skits were hilarious. 
The first, If Men Had Housefath
ers as Girls Have Housemothers, 
showed those three eager house
fathers Edward G. Hobison, Peter Gorre and Sidney Seengreet or Dave Crantz, Ernie Motyland A1 Checco busily conferring warnings on their down-trodden "sons ior
such horrible offenses as putting 
soap in soapdishes and not sign
ing in when they didnt go out. 
However justice triumphed at the 
end of this epic for one of the 
down-trodden ones shot his father 
dead at the end and was campused 
for it.
The other skit, Two Monsters 
Create a Mad Scientist, showed 
two monsters, Motyl and Checco, 
creating a mad scientist  Dave 
Crantz. It was interspersed with 
such gags as Do you always stir 
with your right hand? No. some
times I use a spoon, and Do 
you always write with your right 
hand? No, sometimes I use a 
spoon.

Dear Editor:
Some time ago my English class 
was assigned to write a theme 
upon one of several suggested top
ics among which was the improve
ment of Skibo. Well, I wrote 
about the improvement of Skibo 
merely because try as I might I 
couldnt develop any other topic 
to the required length. For lack 
of any really constructive ideas I 
included the thought of pre-prepared sandwiches to expedite the 
serving of meals. My sole purpose 
in writing that theme was to ob
tain a passing grade. Largely be
cause I stretched my imagination 
and vocabulary* to their utmost 
limits and luckily avoided my 
nemesis, the comma splice, my 
paper was considered slightly 
above the average for that week 
and it was read in class.
That, insofar as I was concerned, 
ended the matter. But behold! 
Two or three weeks later my sug
gestion was adopted. It became 
apparent almost immediately that 
the prime purpose of my sugges
tion was totally lostthe time 
saved, if any, is quite negligible.
Now I dont. know what hap
pened to that paperwhether it 
had any bearing on the change or 
notbut my classmates immedi
ately assailed me charging me with 
full responsibility for instigating a 
reform which benefited no one. 
These stale sandwiches which 
we are getting these days are ex
tremely disagreeable. It mortifies 
me to admit this, but if I were to 
take a blindfold test determining 
whether I could distinguish be
tween a freshly prepared sand
wich and a stale one such as 
we are getting now, Id hesitate to 
wager on the outcome. It would
The eccentric gears that run the 
wheels of government are working 
overtime, it seems. Despite the 
consensus of public opinion polls 
that a majority of the American 
people favor an extension of the 
OPA and of its hold-the-line price 
policy, Congress sees fit to go its 
own lonesome way. The House of 
Representatives has passed a bill 
that would eliminate the tre
mendously vital functions of the 
OPA, and has passed it by an 
overwhelming majority vote.
Paul Porter, OPA head, says 
that if the Senate confirms this 
kicking over of the traces, there 
will be a general price rise of 40% 
in the near future. Such a pros
pect is not a remote piece of poli
tics to be received with the same 
slight disdain American citizens 
accord to politics in general. It 
will cut deeply into your personal 
life. Realize what a 40% price 
rise means. A man who has ac
cumulated $3,000 in savings will 
find that our august representa
tive body, by one stroke of the 
pen, deprives him of $1200 of it. 
A veteran attending college, who 
depends on his $65 check for his 
meat and potatoes, would receive 
only $39 a month. Sure, the face 
value of the money would be the

be entirely guesswork on my part. 
But here is a suggestion which I 
think is practical for those of us 
who occasionally are really in a 
hurry. Set up a counter with 
previously prepared lunches  
sandwiches and a drinkat a fixed 
price. Do not sell to anyone who 
does not have the correct change 
with him, the procedure being 
merely to proceed through the 
line, pick up a packaged lunch and 
drop the money in a convenient 
boxunder the watchful eyes of 
a representative of the manage
ment (if you will). This idea 
would be a god send to the poor 
misguided individuals who come 
here in droves to take entrance 
exams. I did that last December 
and I stood in line twenty minutes 
trying to get something to eat. I 
was still miles (it seemed) from 
anything to eat and the time was 
gone. I had to get back to En
gineering Hall and finish the exam 
(sometimes I wonder why). Well 
there you have it. Make of it 
what you will.
Sincerely,
Howard W. Crandall.
THE WORLDS MOST
same, but what good is a $65 
check if it can buy only $39 worth 
of goods? What will the people 
think who invested their money in 
war bonds, only to find themselves 
penalized for their patriotism? 
But Congress, it seems, thinks free*> 
dom from red tape is worth all of 
this.
It is true that the demands of 
labor, at times excessive, have 
upset the original price ceilings. 
What is needed, however, is a gen
eral revamping of these limits. It 
is ridiculous to turn and throw 
caution to the winds merely be
cause the price situation is con
fused. Let the OPA simplify its 
present set-up. If this is impos
sible, as many businessmen dis
gusted with bureaucratic pro
cedure assert, it is still more pre
ferable to keep red tape for an
other year than to face the conse
quences of no OPA. When the 
minor inflation we would thus 
loose upon ourselves is finally 
curbed and prices are stabilized, 
a high percentage of back savings, 
bank accounts, and insurance 
policies will be wiped out. What 
would happen to you and me till 
prices stabilize is even worse. 
Prices will skyrocket, but wages 
will always be a lap behind. The 
consequences are not a pretty 
prospect for the brave new world 
of the future.
Those who will profit from the 
general suffering will be the lead
ing manufacturers and business
men, who will raise prices to their 
hearts content in this shortageriddled post-war period. And 
they will profit deservedly. For 
after all, didnt they send the lob
bies to Washington that persuaded 
Congress? Didnt the National As
sociation of Manufacturers publish 
full page ads throughout the na
tion to sell the public on the idea?

Editors Armchair
From the Old
We must be getting old, because here it is time to climb 
out of the Editors Armchair, and it seems only a few weeks 
ago that we first sat in the creaky thing. Weve had a wonder
ful time rocking back and forth in the old armchair (even if 
we were so fat we broke the spring in it) bossing everyone on 
the staff around and nebbing into the business of everyone on 
campus. Its been fun, and we wont forget the gay times weve 
had on the top of the Union with the wackiest gang on cam
pus. The staff we had this year was wonderful, and they 
worked like dogs to get the paper out each week. They made 
some sharp paper airoplanes too, and the way they broke 
paper-bags was out of this world.
The staff that will serve you next year promises to be 
even better than this years group. Your new editors are really 
on the ball, and they have big plans already made for the 46- 
47 Tartan. Together with the enthusiastic editorial board and 
the staff that will work under them, Boo and Mary Jane are 
going to make the paper a real success. If the new team con
tinues to click in the future as it is clicking on its first issue, it 
just may starting winning Associated 'Collegiate Press Pace
maker Awards for the old Tartan once again next year.
Before we go, we want to thank all the staff members who 
worked so willingly to make the paper a success this year and 
also the faculty members who so kindly gave their time and 
their advice to us. Max Hannum, as always, was a life-saver on 
a hundred and one occasions. His kindness and steady good 
sense saved us on more than one occasion. This years paper 
owes a special debt to professor Siegfried, as well, for at a 
time when he was terribly busy with his own work, he gave 
hours and hours of his time to helping us redesign the sheet 
and get it on its feet typographically. Dean Yon, Dr. Warden, 
Miss Orr, Miss Bird and Mrs. T. from the News Bureau also 
deserve a share of the credit for any success the paper may 
have had this year. We want to thank especially that wonder
ful Mrs. Hayes whose patience and kindness and friendly in
terest in all of us, and whose willingness to stay up til all 
hours waiting for us to put the paper to bed have been more 
appreciated than we can ever say in words.
Bye now kiddies, good luck, and may all your toasted 
cheese sandwiches be hot. C. H.

are prepared to re-open this serv
ice. The greatest difficulty pre
sented by this plan is that it is 
hard to find American students 
who desire to study in foreign 
countries. Students interested in 
social studies and the fine arts are 
the only ones who would want to 
do this in view of the disturbed 
conditions abroad.
The educators discussed many 
specific problems at the conference 
and tried to find solutions for 
them. The first difficulty encoun
tered is that of language, for few 
of these students speak English 
very well. It was suggested that 
the schools offer the foreign stu
dents who do not speak our lan
guage at all an orientation course 
during the summer. This course 
would consist mainly of an inten
sive study of English with some 
emphasis on American culture and 
customs. To aid the students who 
speak English only moderately 
well, an English course might be 
given for them in the actual cur
riculum. This course would have 
the aspect of a foreign language 
to the students. In addition the 
representatives wondered just how 
far they should go in encouraging 
international relations by accept
ing foreign students in view of the 
fact that so many veterans are 
trying to enter our colleges. It 
was pointed out that most foreign 
students are interested only in our 
largest colleges.
^However, no solution was found 
for the greatest problem which 
faces the educators. This perplex
ing question is the evaluation of 
foreign credits. Since the accred
iting methods of most other coun
tries is so different from ours, it 
is difficult to decide where to place 
the foreign students. These and 
many other questions were dis
cussed by the representatives of 
the schools. The result of their 
efforts will not be known until the 
suggestions are tested in practice.

Although the identity of the 
Queen was not revealed until Fri
day May 3, when her picture ap
peared in the Carnival issue of 
Scottie, the seven candidates for 
the honor, chosen on a basis of 
beauty, personality, activities, 
scholarship, and participation in 
college life as a whole, were elect
ed on March 29, following some 
exciting and spirited campaigning. 
The Whitfield Hall wall was paint
ed at least four times; pictures of 
the preliminary candidates ap
peared in Skibo and other stra
tegic locations; flags and balloons 
were everywhere, and two air
planes dropped campaign litera
ture.
On Saturday April 13, the Car

weeks earlier. Rather than have 
the candidates appear on a stage 
before the judges in an imper

Coronation Committee.
On Thursday May 16 the Car
negie Tech student orchestra will 
present its second concert of the 
month at Carnegie Music Hall. 
With such composers as Haydn,

the program will feature three 
soloists and a student conductor.
Soloists will be Betty Barnhart 
and Helen Gossard. graduating 
seniors, and G. Raymond Bell, 
who is soon to receive his Mas
ters degree. Miss Barnhart will 
solo in Rheinbergers Concerto in 
C Minor, and Mr. Bell will play 
the first movement of the Sc?aimann Piano Concerto in A Minor.
The program is outstanding in 
that it features for the first time 
in the history of the orchestra, a 
student conductor performing a 
major symphony. The conductor is 
Theodore Ripper, a junior in the 
Department of Music, who will 
conduct two movements from 
Haydns G Major (Military) Sym

conducting with Dr. Frederick 
Dorian, is also an accomplished 
organist, having played the or

The concert with Dr. Frederick 
Dorian conducting, will be pre

TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
Dont tell me that guy Butler isnt versatile. At the inter
squad football game Saturday morning, the Kentuckian start
ed the game at quarterback. At various and sundry intervals, 
he changed to fullback and halfback. Then, when the opposi
tion got close to the goal line, he was up in the line. He block
ed two of the conversion tries. Speaking of the Kentucky 
spirit: someone told C. T. to putGolfers Lose,
Reds Take 
Grid Game
his money on Assault in the Derby 
last Saturday. The rebel comes 
back with, I dont have any 
money and if I did, I wouldnt bet 
on that lousy Texas nag if it was 
the last horse in the world! (P. 
S.: Assault came through and 
paid 8 to 1.)
GRRR!
The tennis team ran into a bit 
of Pitt strategy Wednesday. The 
boys arrived at the Pitt courts at 
1:30 and started to warm up for 
the scheduled (they thought) 2:00 
match. Along comes the groundskeeper to tell them to get off and 
that theres no match until 3:00 
So they came back to Tech to 
rest for an hour.
Bill Beamer will be one of the 
nations top milers if he doesnt 
watch his step. The guy has cut 
practically ten seconds off his pre
vious times every time out this 
year so far. Hes come from five 
minutes down to the 4:30s now. 
Saturday against Geneva, he 
abandoned his usual role of fol
lowing the leaders heels until the 
last lap, and took the lead early 
himself. He not only held it, but 
beat the field by a quarter of a 
lap and came in with his best time 
this year.
Tie Last Week
The Tech golfers strolled around 
the roughs of the Field Club twice 
last week, coming back to the cam
pus with a tie and a loss under 
their collective belts.
Christenson Comes Through
A week ago Monday, the West 
Virginia Mountaineers rolled in 
and proved conclusively that they 
can do more than play basketball 
as they took Techs measure by 
the decisive score of 12^-2^. 
The only Tech points were garner
ed by Arnie Christenson, Techs 
ace. Playing in the number one 
position, Chris fashioned an 81 
over the tough lay-out to win one 
nine, half one and walk off with 
medalist honors for the day. Earl
ier in the season, he sizzled a 78 
over the same course.
On Friday, the Greasy Stonites from Slippery Rock State 
Teachers College invaded the Tar
tan home grounds and the two 
teams fought to a TVz-lVz tie.
Tennis Team Loses To 
Pitt, 8-1; Trips Geneva
Coach Frank Moses sent his 
courtless netsters into action twice 
this past week, and the boys came 
back with one up, one down. Last 
Wednesday, Pitt chalked up an 
8-1 win over the Skibos on Pitts 
courts, while two days later, the 
Tartans whipped Geneva 5-2 on 
the Westinghouse courts, tem
porary home grounds.
Pitt Does It Again
The Pitt debacle was just a mat
ter of how oad the score would be. 
The courts were in bad shape 
and Techs team couldnt get go
ing. Southworth of Pitt gave an 
indication of what was on the fire 
as he whipped Jack Meyers 6-2, 
6-3. At the same time, Heckman 
and Eellke of Tech couldnt seem 
to find themselves and were beaten 
by Roberts and Bald, respectively. 
Joe Harmuth took it on the chin
W.A.A. Elects 
New Officers
Last Friday elections were held 
for officers of the W. A. A. Board. 
This was an all-school election 
because all Tech women belong to 
W. A. A. regardless of whether 
they are active in it or not. Other 
members of the Board were chosen 
by the present Board from those 
girls who handed in petitions for 
the position. The new Board, in
cluding the officer? will be an
nounced at the W. A A. Awards 
Banquet, which will be held this 
Thursday, May 9.
The attempt to plan a tennis 
tournament has been given up be
cause of the little time left this 
semester and because of the bad 
situation on the tennis courts. A lot 
of interest was shown in the tour
nament, however, so it will be run 
in the fall.
Ping-Pong, Mush ball Conclude 
Activities
The tables tennis tournament is 
coming along on schedule  it 
should be finished at the end of 
next week. Mush ball is scheduled 
for Wednesday at 3:30 and Friday 
t 4:30. These two sports will con
clude this years athletic season.
from Steele of the Panthers, 
while Dick DiPrima seemed head
ed for a victory when he won his 
first set with Pitts Art Harmuth 
11-9. However, Harmuth caught 
fire and took the next two sets, 
6-3, 6-0.
Childs Gets Lone Tech Point
The only marker for the visitors 
was garnered by Childs against 
Jack OBrien of Pitt. The diminu
tive Childs was content to keep 
the ball in play and let OBrien 
make the errors. This strategy 
worked time and again and Childs 
emerged with a 7-5, 6-3 win.
Pitt swept the doubles to make 
a rout of the affair.
On Friday, the boys from Ge
neva invaded and Tech had its 
hands full in winning. Hampered 
by the loss of their ace, Jack 
Meyers, who is giving his foot a 
chance to heal, the Tartans were 
forced to juggle their line-up to 
meet the occasion. Joe Harmuth 
was elevated to the number one slot 
and proved himself worthy as he 
beat York of the visitors, 6-2, 6-4. 
A1 Sellke, playing in the No. 2 po
sition, duplicated Harmuths score 
in beating Trembath of Geneva. 
Geneva squared the match when 
Reed beat DiPrima and Firestone 
came from behind to beat Tony 
Arrott. Bob Schoenberger put the 
Skibos back into the lead by trim
ming Mclsaac of Geneva 6-2, 6-1. 
With the score 3-2 in Techs favor, 
York and Reed almost upset the 
applecart when they took the first 
set from Sellke and Harmuth 9-7. 
The latter came back to win the 
next two, though and clinch the 
match. Arrott and DiPrima of Tech 
closed out the match by winning 
over the Trembath-Firestone duo.

Harmuth-Sellke, Tech defeated York-Reed, 7-9, 6-4, 6-4; DiPrima-Arrott, Tech defeated TrembathMudville had nothing on the 
Tech Bowl Saturday morning 
when Bill Donahoes future grid 
flashes took the field. The entire 
football squad of 60 odd charac
ters was divided into two teams, 
which, for lack of better names 
well call the Reds and Blues. The 
final tally found the Reds on top 
.25-0.
The game itself, played amid 
intermittent drizzles, was high
lighted mainly by the spirit of the 
two teams, as the brand of foot
ball itself left much to be desired. 
Both teams, running out the T, 
showed plenty of fight, and did 
themselves proud considering their 
short time of practice to date.
The Red team showed a superi
or line and outcharged the Blues 
time and again. The latters backs 
didnt get a chance to move. Skin
ner broke the ice in the first quar
ter for the Red team and racked 
up the seasons first touchdown. 
The try for point was missed and 
the end of the quarter showed 
6-0 in the way of a score. The sec
ond quarter went scoreless and it 
remained that way at the half.
The second half found both 
teams in the thick of the affair 
and both gathered plenty of yard
age. The Reds rallied to stave off 
their opponents in the crucial mo
ments, while they themselves 
crossed the goal line three more 
times to amass their final total of 
25 points. Lineups:

Sherwood Starts It
The meet got off to its usual 
start with Long John Sherwood 
stepping over the high hurdles in 
16 flat. A remarkably good time 
considering that Jack was running 
up hill on a rain-soaked track 
against the wind.
Beamer Breezes Home in 4:38.3 
The next event, the mile run, 
saw Bill Beamer in his usual good 
form walk away from the field in 
the back stretch and cross the fin
ish line in 4 minutes, 38.3 seconds. 
This time cut six seconds off his 
last weeks time and almost twenty 
seconds off his time in the Case 
meet. Nice going Bill.
Here Comes Andrews 
The 100 yard splash introduced 
Andrews for the first time as he 
led the pack home in 10.5 seconds.
In the 440 King Kindi had 
trouble at first but he managed to 
sneak through the pack on the last 
turn and had enough left for the 
stretch drive to cross the line first. 
He was followed home by two 
more Tech boys, Kruper and 
Kohn, giving the home team nine 
more points.
The two mile run turned out to 
be a clean sweep for the Tartans 
also when Murphy, the only Gene
va entrant, was forced to drop 
out midway through the race be
cause of stomach cramps.
Yeh, Knats!
The 120 Low Hurdles proved to 
be the most thrilling race of the 
day with Sherwood and Andrews 
(that man again) running neck 
and neck (hubba-hubba) the 
whole distance and hitting the 
tape with our boy Jack just a 
knats eye lash in front.
Andrews Gets 24 Points 
In the field events Geneva fared 
a little better taking a clean sweep 
in the javelin, a first and second 
in the discus, and Andrews left 
the ground for 18 7*4 to take 
first in the broad jump, and raise 
his personal total to 24 points.
Ware and Reihl, however, came 
through as expected and won the 
pole vault and high jump for the 
Caberon Plaid. Summary:

ry Como is Pauls man when it 
comes to crooning, and as for 
songs, likes them all. Any kind of 
food, well-prepared, appeals to 
Paul and his tastebuds. Hand him 
a detective story and hell politely 
seize it.
Paul certainly is an energetic 
man. His attending evening class
es for two years is indicative of 
this fact. He likes our system at 
Tech which he thinks cannot be 
improved upon, which is a real 
pat on the back. To quote him. 
Everythings fine. If you want 
to catch him at home, tell the con
ductor to let you off at Dormont, 
inquire of anybody where you 
can find Paul, and theyll answer 
with enthusiasm, right down the 
street.
Paging Ruth McGraw! Paging 
Ruth McGraw! OK, Ruth, come 
jut from behind that Plaid issue 
and inform this fortunate reporter 
>f your present and past. Gee! 
A.m I the lucky one getting to inerview the Editor herself. Thats 
ight stoo-dents, as you read on, 
youll know enough about your 
ditor to say you know her peronally. How could you help it? 
Ruthies pleasing personality is 
vidence in itself of her knack for 
?etting along with people. She 
airly bubbles over with wit, and 
good humor, and what with those 
iparkling eyes, well . . . just lead 
he way.
Seriously, ttiough, Ruth has an 
vious record behind her and just 
bright a forecast ahead, for she 
ows promise. Success here at 
ivening School is summed up in 
ard work. Having served on 
udent Council as Vice President, 
d acting as Associate Editor of 
e PLAID, not to mention shes 
een a loyal standby in getting 
e paper out, are facts which ex
lain in themself that Ruthies 
rtainly done well. Her biggest 
ob, however, is her present one; 
at of editing our Evening School 
aper. We owe her a lot for the 
lendid job shes been doing in
1inalsOh Gloom!
Final exams were always remli^cent of high school days to 
ne, and I thought preparing for 
Tech Evening School exam 
vould be just a bit different. But, 
find myseelf in the same prelicament  lost assignments, forotten references, and too many 
Dther things to do the night I 
hould be studying.
It was just last night that It
hought it would be wise to do a 
ittle brushing-up on my Friday 
light class work before tackling 
ur exam. I started by trying to 
ollect my materials. (Before I 
ell you what this included, I 
vant you to know that I am a 
neticulous person at heart!) My 
ext book was not where I put it 
lerman, the Grsmlin, carried it
o the bookcase. My faithful litle black book had been sampled 
y our ever-hungry puppy who 
ift it only slightly dog-earred. A 
ist of references, which I kept regiously through the term, was in(
*y desk at the office. My only 
isolation was that a pencil and 
(4ren can always be resurrected 
rom our family desk.
Now I was ready to study. Be 
kuiet allI am going to concenate! But waitthere was a tele
hone call I wanted to make You 
y Louise isn't at hpnie tonight?
11 her I palled. Thank you.
liiT
this line. Orchids to Ruthie in her 
editorship!
How she remains so trim at 116 
lbs. for that 5' 5V2" figure must 
be a heavily-guarded secret, for 
Ruth actually dotes on spaghetti 
with meat balls, and candy, any 
kind, any time. But then, how 
she manages to do so many things 
here in Evening School, as well as 
all her outside activities, surely is 
cause for open-eyed amazement. 
Through the day shes a secretary 
to the Assistant Treasurer of the 
Blaw-Knox Co., and at night, 
well-11 keep in mind Ruth is a 
popular girl. Although she ad
mits nothing about her love life, 
and since Im not sworn to se
crecy, Ive discovered, he answers 
to Jack, so if this upsets your 
apple-cart, remember, I warned 
you.
Voice and Speech has been of 
major importance in Ruthies line 
of intellectual interests and she 
really attends her classes faith
fully. Among her lighter fancies, 
dancing heads the list and she en
joys movies, but if theres a toss 
up a smooth fox trot will domi
nate these two choices. Her fav
orite song, and what good taste, is 
none other than the very popular, 
Oh What It Seemed To Be, and
I was really ready to begin 
now. Everything (well, almost) 
was right at my fingertips. That 
phrase I didnt get during class 
last March is just as clear as day 
now. My vocabulary for class was 
plain to mepractically, anyhow. 
There were only two more chap
ters to read, and then that report 
for the last next week. Im almost 
finished now, and its only 9:00.
Maybe, if I hurry, Ill have time 
to drop in at the corner drug store 
for a coke. Oh! A coke. I think Ill 
get one right now. I need refresh
ment!
Tuition Change
Because of greatly increased 
costs of operation, Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology has found it 
necessary to increase tuition rates 
in certain categories of the Even
ing classes. The charge for Even
ing Courses offered by the de
partments of the College of En
gineering and Science and the 
College of Fine Arts will be in
creased to $4.20 per unit. Evening 
courses offered by the departments 
of Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College for Women and the Divi
sion of Humanistic and Social 
Studies will remain at $3.60 per 
unit. The general fee has been 
eliminated for students in Evening 
classes. These increases in tuition 
will be effective at the beginning 
of the Fall Semester.
Spring! Spring!.Spring Carnival 
tonight and here I sit trying to 
put my mind on things like gossip 
and such while my spirit is float
ing around dancing to Joey Sims 
orchestraoh wellThanks to the 
girls who helped last Saturday 
with work in connection with the 
banquet, Dorothy Papas, Virginia 
Ehni, Ruth McGraw and Cecille 
Zellner, but we were afraid they 
werent going to come because 
they were sidetracked into the 
Hidaway Bar. Couldnt do without 
them . . . The wedding bells will 
ring the latter part of May for 
Pearl Leleha. Heres wishing you 
happiness . . . Have you ever 
heard the Bumble Boogie? I 
have just been informed that by 
not hearing it that I havent liv
ed. Quick, a recording of B. B. 
by Freddie Martin and bring me 
back to life. And this Hay, Baa 
Lee Lee Bapnow there is a 
title for youMairzy Doats was 
badbut thisO, brother. It does 
have a catchy tune, though. We 
hear that Mary De Maria is ill. 
Please hurry and get well, Mary, 
we miss you here at the PLAID. 
The banquet on the 27th was real
ly the affair of the year, so we 
girls are told by the male at
tendants. But, we shall go on hop
ing that some day, some banquet
Dick Haymes is the one she thinks 
should sing it. However, Bing 
neednt feel neglected or slighted, 
for shes willing to divide her ohs 
and ahs between them.
My! My! Here are some more 
vital facts you can record in your 
book of People I Have Met and 
Liked. Miss McGraw has a keen 
desire for crocheting and also gets 
much pleasure from reading. She 
particularly enjoys mysteries, ro
mances and adventurous novels. 
When asked about her pet-peeve, 
Ruth answered rather meekly, I 
dislike being pushed around in 
crowds, and people who crack 
gum.
In conclusion, I, your rambling 
reporter, leave you with this 
thought, Keep your eye on Ruth 
McGraw because shes destined for 
the best life can offer.

really interesting. Its nice seeing 
one of the Evening Students,
Ralph Stidham, accompanying his 
wife each noon for dinner now 
that they are both working in 
the city. They tell me that I need 
seven more linesoh joy! Gee, I 
wish more people did more things 
that more PLAID members knew 
about! Inspiration, where are you? 
Water, water, everywhere: and not 
a drop to drink. But not now since 
we got ambitious and went down

... by wire 
and radio!
Maybe youve thought of the Bell 
Telephone System as using only 
wires. It uses and pioneers in 
radio too.
Radio waves are used to carry 
your voice across the seas to tele
phones in other lands . . . across 
water barriers here at home ... to 
vessels plying inland waters and 
to ships out at sea. And before too 
long, radio links will provide tele
phone service for cars and trucks.
Radio relay systems that will 
carry long distance messages from 
city to city are now in the advanced 
experimental stage.
In every case the Bell System 
uses the kind of transmission, wire 
or radio, that provides the best 
service for the most people.

The Fnd man doubts if you can

cause I think Guby bought them 
all . . . And coming to the Harris

The cnly importance that the End

that he is dying to learn the words

Four Shouts to the Wind 
Department:
Shout One is for the whole 
Spring Carnival and for Joe Nut
ter who headed the Carnival 
Committee! Shout Two is for A1 
Checco, Ernie Motyl, Dave Crantz 
and Bobby Parks for their won
derful skits in Scotch and Soda. 
Shout Three is for Gerry Jedd and 
Helen Leerburgtwo of the most 
talented people we know. Shout 
Four is again for Danny Franks 
and Helen Miller organizing 
Scotch and Soda. We all owe them 
a lot of thanks, believe me.

lis. It is conceded 
end to the OPA 
wuuiu cause a slight price rise, 
but soon, they say, the stimulus 
uncontrolled prices gives to manu
facturers will bring price levels 
down to normal. Competition will 
force prices down. We must take 
the NA.M.s word for this, who 
stands to gain tremendously if they 
are wrong. On the other side such 
eminent and competent men as 
Chester Bowles, Paul Porter, and 
Bernard Baruch tell us that the 
opposite will happen. As an ex
ample take the U. S. price rise 
since 1939, a 30% rise but spread 
over seven years. Did the great 
increase in civilian production 
since the wars end lower prices, 
as it should have according to the 
N.A.M., because of the competition 
between the greater number of 
manufacturers? No, lets not be 
deluded: when the N.A.M. sings 
Happy Days Are Here Again as 
the death knell of the OPA, they 
mean happy days for themselves 
alone, not for the American public.
A few days ago *Pittsburgh 
newspapers told how county de
tectives, in a new burst of energy, 
broke up a few dens of the num
bers racket. The petty racketeers 
who operate the business were 
arraigned for trial. Confectionery 
and grocery store proprietors, who 
served as bookies on the side in 
order to keep their customers, 
were heavily fined. This is con
sidered justice, for these people 
are doing harm to the public wel
fare. It seems a bit pathetic, that 
small-time racketeers are so ef
fectively squelched, while the re
spectable big-timers, working 
through all legal forms in business 
and industry, are unchecked in 
their attempt to do the American 
people a much greater injury.
Four Burps to the Breeze 
Department:
Oh hell! The End Man loves 
everybody  after the Carnival  
and so, well, this part of the col
umn just isnt going to be. And 
besides the things and the people 
that he would like to Burp at 
wouldnt make especially nice 
reading. Hell think of something 
by next week, you can be sure.
So Sorry Department:
It seems to be the consensus of 
opinion on campus that the End 
Man over-stepped himself when 
he mentioned, in last weeks col
umn, that he didnt like the Spen
cer Tracy short on the cancer 
drive. Perhaps the End Man 
should have said that he just 
doesnt like Spencer Tracy, but 
that Would probably have been 
just as sacrilegious. However, and 
believe me, the End Man was not 
trying to cast aspersions on the 
cancer drive. And as someone told 
him, he doesnt HAVE to go to the 
movies sixty times a week.
Nursing Course 
Is Discontinued
The nursing course formerly 
offered in Margaret Morrison Col
lege has been discontinued be
cause of insufficient enrollment to 
make practical the classes in nurs
ing given for Tech women at West 
Penn Hospital. Previously girls; 
interested in nursing took two 
years work at Tech and two 
years nursing at West Penn Hos
pital, after which they received a 
diploma in nursing. They were* 
then returned to Tech for a fifth 
year, were awarded a B. S. degree, 
and were prepared to hold such 
positions as head nurse, superin
tendent of nurses, or teacher in a 
nursing school. Although the 
present sophomore, junior, and 
senior classes will be permitted 
to complete their programs, fresh
man students will not be able to 
do so. These students may change 
to the regular general science' 
course or may transfer to an en
tirely different department. It 
will also be possible to continue 
at Tech for another year and then 
transfer to either Pitt or Duquesne, 
both of which offer a degree in 
nursing.
Home Ec Notice
The Faculty of the Home 
Economics Department will 
entertain the graduating sen
iors of their department and 
the members of the Home Ec
onomics Club at a tea on 
Wednesday May 8, from 3:30
