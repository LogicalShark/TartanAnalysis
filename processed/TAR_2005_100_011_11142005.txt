MEET THE BLACK GREEKS
Students help black Greek organizations influence spread
by Louisa Kinoshi
Staffwriter
On October 28,2004, two CMU 
students stood in front of the cam
pus community at the Fence as 
new brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha 
Fraternity, Inc. Along with two 
other brothers, they wore nicely 
ironed black pants, white shirts, 
and black ties.
But something else stood out
 they wore skullcaps. That day 
marked the beginning of the re
surgence of the black Greek com
munity at Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity.
This movement has its roots 
almost 100 years earlier, when 
Alpha Phi Alpha, the first frater
nity for African-Americans, was 
founded at Cornell University 
in Ithaca, New York. Created by 
seven young men, the fraternity 
initially served as a study and 
support group for minority stu
dents at Cornell, who faced racial 
prejudices both educationally and 
socially.
Today, there are currently four 
historically black Greek organi
zations being increasingly repre
sented on the Carnegie Mellon 
campus: Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa 
Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Omega 
Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., and one 
sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha So
rority, Inc. These organizations 
operate under the National PanHellenic Council (NPHC). At a 
school where The Journal of Blacks 
in Higher Education reported the 
graduation rate of African-Ameri
can students as one of the lowest 
among selective colleges in 2004, 
these organizations are influenc
ing students to strive for academic 
excellence and providing support 
and new social opportunities.
For some, the growth of black 
Greek organizations at CMU 
could not have come at a better 
time. I almost didnt come back 
to CMU. I wanted to stay home 
in Puerto Rico because I thought 
it was too hard, said Ricardo Al
varado, a recent alumnus from 
the Tepper Schools class of05. I 
would have never graduated from
Carnegie Mellon; I would have 
stayed back home if not for Kappa 
Alpha Psi.
Reasons for joining vary. Da
mian Dourado, Assistant Di
rector of the Carnegie Mellon 
Advising Resource Center and 
also a brother of Kappa Alpha 
Psi, explains the reasons mi
norities choose historically black 
Greek letter organizations: The 
brotherhood and sisterhood of 
the organization and a chance to 
have a family away from home. It 
creates a new support system. 
Omar Parris-Dione, a senior 
economics major, said, I grew up 
in Harlem, New York. There were 
role models in my community, 
but my father wasnt in my life. I 
found comfort reading books by 
black males [who] influenced so
ciety. I read books by Martin Lu
ther King, Adam Clayton Powell, 
and Frederick Douglass. All those 
men were Alpha men.
Most black Greek organiza
tions in the area are based at the 
University of Pittsburgh. Black 
Greek presence brings the two
schools together, said Nathaniel 
Green, a third-year architecture 
major and a brother of Alpha Phi 
Alpha. Its opening Pitt to us, get
ting Pitt students to come down 
to CMU and interact with CMU 
students.
These organizations were 
founded originally for AfricanAmericans; however, now they 
are all equal opportunity organi
zations and are open to all back
grounds on the CMU campus. I 
did a lot of research. I knew from 
experience that Kappa Alpha Psi 
was not discriminatory. One of 
the most prominent members, 
Arthur Schomburg, was Puerto 
Rican, said Alvarado. A group 
of people with common culture 
need to get together, share that 
culture, and motivate each other 
in a positive way.
The goal is to uplift the com
munity as a whole, not just black 
people, said David Latimore, a 
senior information systems major 
and a brother of Kappa Alpha Psi.

Special to The Tartan
As weapons technology 
has advanced, and inevitably 
spread, the principles of war
fare used by governments to jus
tify their actions have changed. 
Today, it is widely accepted 
that biological and chemical 
warfare have limited military 
uses, and most governments 
have pledged to abstain via in
ternational conventions from 
their use. However, no such
conventions exist that prohibit 
the use of nuclear weapons. 
Therefore, governments are 
left to define their own justifi
cations. In December 2001, the 
U.S. Department of Defense 
issued its Nuclear Posture Re
view to outline how nuclear 
weapons fit into its overall de
fense strategy. How familiar 
are you with the United States 
stance on nuclear weapons?

Student Life collects 
holiday help for needy
by Justine Lee
Junior Staffwriter
The U.S. Census Bureau esti
mates that this year the coun
try will produce 256 million 
turkeys, 649 million pounds 
of cranberries, and about 1.6 
billion pounds of sweet pota
toes, many of which are con
sumed on Thanksgiving. For 
those who cannot afford such 
abundance, however, Carnegie 
Mellon offers a solution: the 
Thanksgiving Basket Outreach 
Program.
This marks the seventh year 
of the Thanksgiving Basket 
Outreach Program. It was in
troduced through a community 
service initiative by Student 
Life in 1999 and has steadily in
creased in participation every 
year. Residential houses, Greek 
chapters, student organiza
tions, and University depart
ments are asked to collect cer
tain food items and put together 
a food basket, which will provide 
an underprivileged family with a 
complete and nutritious Thanks
giving meal. This year the pro
gram will benefit the Asera Care 
Hospice, Rainbow Kitchen, and 
Greater Love Outreach of Pitts
burgh.
M. Shernell Smith, Student De
velopment Coordinator, is in her 
third year heading this program 
and is pleased with the schools 
solid participation. Usually we 
average around 30 to 40 baskets, 
Smith said, but last year we 
moved upwards to 55 baskets.
This success seems to be a re
sult of the charitys nature. Peo

For nearly a quarter of Carnegie 
Mellon students, November is the 
month to celebrate. This Novem
ber marks CMUs first annual 
Asian Heritage Month (AHM), a 
four-week series of events spon
sored by the Universitys Asian 
culture organizations to increase 
awareness, interest, and apprecia
tion of the many different cultural 
groups at CMU. Groups organiz
ing the months activities include 
Asian fraternities and sororities 
and the Asian, Japanese, Korean, 
Taiwanese, and Hong Kong Stu
dent Associations, among others.
According to Jea Suh, Asian 
Heritage Month Coordinator, 
This months festivities aim to 
incorporate all the aspects of cul
ture, including food making, per
formance, discussion, film, and 
art.
In prior years, Lunar Gala and 
Asian Heritage Week celebrations 
were held in the spring semester 
and included merely a few days 
of Asian cultural celebrations. As

Economics professor receives award for 
contributions to policy and management

Robert P. Strauss, a professor 
of economics and public finance 
in the H. John Heinz III School 
of Public Policy and Manage
ment, is the 2005 recipient of 
the Steven D. Gold Award for 
Contributions to Public Finan
cial Management. This award 
was a natural one for Strauss 
to receive, as he has already 
received two Presidential pens 
(tokens of recognition from 
the President) and the U.S. 
Treasurys Exceptional Service 
Award for his work in the sector 
of public finance.
This prestigious award has 
been given annually since 1997 
by the Association for Public 
Policy Analysis and Manage
ment, the National Tax Asso
ciation (founded 1907), and 
the National Conference of 
State Legislatures. The award 
is given in memory of Steven 
D. Gold, who was a specialist in 
state fiscal issues.
Strauss attaches much per
sonal significance to this award. 
Steve was a good friend of 
mine, and he involved me in 
several projects with state gov
ernments, he said.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Strauss talked about 
the award as well as the actions expressed interest in par
ticipating in the celebration, the 
Multicultural Presidents Council, 
a group of cultural organization 
presidents, decided to move the 
event from the spring to the fall 
and lengthen it to a month of 
events.
At the beginning of this month, 
all the participating organiza
tions gathered on the Cut to kick 
off Asian Heritage Month. The 
activities started out with the 
three-day International Festival, 
which explored both cultural and 
environmental issues. The festival 
was followed by the AHM parade, 
an afternoon march down Forbes 
Avenue, to the University of Pitts
burgh campus and back. Suh says 
the parade was met with a lot of 
support from both students and 
passing community members.
Though cooperation among 
CMU cultural groups has been 
key to AMHs success, the month 
also includes a lot of collabora
tion with University of Pittsburgh 
Asian organizations, including 
several joint events and an Asian 
Alliance Meeting between the two

complishments that led up to it. 
He is appreciative of the recog
nition from his colleagues, and 
at the awards ceremony, which 
was held in Washington, D.C., 
on November 4, he was flattered 
when a member of the committee 
that selected him said that he had 
read his work and was impressed 
with it.
Strauss has received accolades 
not only from U.S. Presidents 
Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, 
as well as from his professional 
peers, but from many of his stu
dents as well. One such student 
was CMU alumnus Nick Zitalli, 
who had taken Strauss public fi
nance course and sent an e-mail 
to complement Strauss on the 
award. Strauss commented, That 
makes teaching worthwhile,

Prize winner for poetry, will 
give a poetry reading at 8 pm 
on Wednesday as part of the 
Adamson Visiting Writers 
Series. The reading will take 
place in the Adamson Wing of 
Baker Hall.
As a poet, Kooser is known for 
the accessibility of his words, 
language, and ideas. A profes
sor of English at the University 
of Nebraska-Lincoln, Kooser is 
the author of 11 full-length col
lections of poetry. He won the

Canyon Press.
Kooser was appointed the 
Library of Congresss 13 Poet 
Laureate Consultant in Poetry 
in the fall of 2004.
According to the Library of
Congress website, Kooser inau
gurated the program American 
Life in Poetry (www.americanlifeinpoetry.org) during 
his first term as Poet Laureate. 
In the program, which offers 
a free weekly column to local 
newspapers around the coun
try, Kooser provides a brief in
troduction to a poem by a living 
American each week. According 
to the Library of Congress, this 
initiative offers the chance for 
poets to reach tens of thousands 
of readers.
Kooser has written in a vari
ety of forms, including plays, 
fiction, personal essays, and lit
erary criticism. His first book of 
prose, Local Wonders: Seasons 
in the Bohemian Alps, garnered 
several national awards.
Kooser earned a BS at Iowa
State University in 1962 and an 
MA at the University of Nebraska 
in 1968. He is a former vicepresident of the Lincoln Benefit 
Life, where he worked as an 
insurance representative.
Its been interesting to watch 
him devote a number of years to 
a career as a poet and to have 
been recognized by the Library 
of Congress and the Pulitzer 
Prize Committee, said Gerald 
Costanzo, professor of English 
and founder of Carnegie Mellon 
University Press. According to 
Costanzo, the pair have been 
friends for more than 30 years.
The Carnegie Mellon 
University Press published 
Koosers collection Winter 
Morning Walks: One Hundred 
Postcards to Jim Harrison, in 
2001. As a friend of his, I
wanted to publish that book 
[on cancer recovery], said 
Costanzo. The book won the 
2001 Nebraska Book Award for 
poetry.
I think its important to 
know we are very lucky to have 
him reading for us, and that 
he is a wonderful poet who is 
finally getting the recognition 
he deserves, said professor of 
English Jim Daniels.
Three of the last five Pulitzer 
winners, including Kooser, 
either started or spent some 
portion of their careers with 
the Carnegie Mellon University 
Press.
Wednesday will mark the 
third time Kooser has read at 
Carnegie Mellon. A reception 
will follow the reading, which 
is free and open to the public.
Executive

Bradford L. Yankiver
The Tartan will be having its annual 
elections on December 1, and you are 
welcome to run. Many college newspa
pers do not use a democratic election 
to determine its leadership, but we 
believe that fair elections are an impor
tant part of keeping our organization 
transparent and keeping your news 
source vibrant and trustworthy.
Generally, editorial staff members 
begin as writers and move up into lead
ership positions, but on occasion some 
of our most successful and influential 
staff members have stepped directly 
into editor or manager roles.
Our annual election determines who 
will fill the roles of executive officer, 
editor-in-chief, managing editor, all 
section editors, and the art and photo 
editors. Managers are appointed by 
the executive officer and confirmed by 
a majority vote of the editorial staff. 
Terms are one calendar year, which 
allows new editors to use the former 
editors  often seniors  as resources 
before they graduate.
Staff members who climb the Tartan 
ladder are well prepared by their expe
rience. Editors spend hours every week 
instructing writers on journalistic skills 
and ethics, coaching them on their 
writing techniques, and teaching The 
Tartans style. Managers teach their 
staffs how to run a business and relate 
professionally to others.
New people who have not been pre
viously involved with The Tartan can 
always bring new ideas to the table, 
however. The Tartan would not be 
where it is now without the people 
who have stepped straight into leader
ship roles.
If you want to learn more about join
ing The Tartans editorial staff, please 
feel free to contact me by e-mailing 
exec@th etartan. org.
On another note, after Hurricane 
Katrina and earthquakes in Pakistan 
and India, there was a flurry of phil
anthropic fundraising on campus. Stu
dents and faculty alike gave thousands 
of dollars to charity. But over the past 
month, two students have been de
veloping a creative way to sustain our 
communitys support for disaster relief 
around the world.
Students Shabnam Aggarwal and 
Sean Weinstock have created the Bar
gain Steeler Card (BSC), which will 
give students great deals at restaurants 
and shops all over Oakland, Shadyside, 
and Squirrel Hill. All of the proceeds 
from this endeavor will support world
wide relief efforts.
In the beginning of this semester, the 
editorial staff of The Tartan expressed 
an interest in supporting some sort of 
philanthropy. When we learned about 
Sean and Shabnams idea, we were 
eager to get on board. Were excited by 
the initiatives novel and sustainable 
approach to charity, so The Tartan is 
proud to partner with the BSC group. 
We plan to help Shabnam and Sean 
with their initial expenses and to pro
mote the card in the newspaper. Be 
sure to keep an eye out for the Bargain 
Steeler Card.
Finally, I and a number of The Tar
tan editors visited University President 
Jared Cohon last week. In our cordial 
visit, Cohon responded to The Tartans 
recent editorial Ugly and cumber
some, sure; but is it art?, expressing 
his genuine enthusiasm for the coming 
piece of public art, Borofskys sculpture 
Walking to the Sky.
It seems, though, that The Tartan 
isnt the only publication on campus 
that has published a dissent to Cohons opinion. FOCUS, a journal of the 
faculty and staff of Carnegie Mellon 
University, dedicated a full page of 
its recent issue to Martin Aurands in
triguing feature story on the Mall and 
Borofskys work. Aurand offered an 
astute point that deserves reiteration: 
Art should not compromise art. The 
Malls design is art in itself, he says, 
and Borofskys work will simply detract 
from that.
It seems that much of the campus 
community is concerned that this new 
artwork will compromise the integrity 
of the Mall. I hope that Cohon and 
other decision-makers will earnestly 
listen to and take into consideration 
this widely held opinion.

Students split on nuclear usage
by Erik Sorenson
Staffwriter
In last weeks survey, Carnegie 
Mellon students were asked what 
circumstances justify the United 
States use of nuclear force. 
Results show students are split 
down the middle: roughly half 
think there are appropriate uses 
of nuclear force, and half do not. 
Of the students who supported 
nuclear weapon use, 80 percent 
thought a U.S. nuclear retaliation 
against another nation would be 
an appropriate response if that 
other nation had already used 
nuclear weapons against the U.S.
or one of its allies. Forty percent 
thought a U.S. nuclear retaliation 
against a biological or chemical 
attack was warranted, and only a 
handful of students were in favor 
of a nuclear response to eliminate 
a rogue states WMD program or 
retaliate against a terrorist nu
clear attack.
The consensus among students 
who justified a nuclear response 
was that the U.S. should maintain 
a nuclear arsenal of 100-1000 
weapons to achieve the goals 
outlined above. Students who 
believed there is no appropriate 
use of nuclear force stated that 
the U.S. should reserve no weap
ons to launch a nuclear attack.
However, the survey did not ask 
whether these students thought 
the U.S. should maintain weapons 
as a deterrent.
To examine the use of nuclear 
weapons, it is important to exam
ine their capabilities. The aver
age nuclear weapon in todays 
U.S. arsenal has a yield of 200 
kilotons (about 10 times the ex
plosive power of the bombs used 
against Japan) with sizes ranging 
from 100 kilotons to 1 megatons. 
The effects of a nuclear detona
tion can be broken down into 
three types of damage: complete 
destruction, severe fires, and

Deliberative poll to take 
place on November 19
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
On Saturday, November 19, 
ninety students will participate 
in CMUs campus conversation, 
the first campus-specific deliber
ative poll in the nation. A scaleddown version of the community 
deliberative poll that took place 
on October 29, the campus poll 
will focus on two main issues: 
the nature of a diverse campus 
community, and moral values 
in campus life in regard to stu
dent file-sharing, according to 
the Southwestern Pennsylvania 
Program for Deliberative 
Democracy (SPPDD) website.
The poll is a joint venture of 
the SPPDD and the Coro Center 
for Civic Leadership, an orga
nization that promotes the 
political contributions of emerg
ing leaders in southwestern 
Pennsylvania through programs 
and initiatives like the upcoming 
campus poll.
The event was coordinated by 
Randy Weinsten, a Coro Fellow 
in Local Democracy and 2005 
CMU graduate with a bachelors 
degree in philosophy and busi
ness.
According to Weinsten, the 
day will begin with an initial sur
vey and small group discussion 
from 2:15 to 3:15 pm, followed
by an hour-long expert panel 
discussion and a half-hour-long 
wrap-up discussion. The days 
events end with a final survey. 
Volunteers will then compare 
the responses of both surveys 
to see how the participants were 
influenced by the discussion and 
the expert panels contribution. 
The poll aims to create an active, 
diversified social scene and to 
spark more discussion of impor
tant issues among students.
Weinsten credits his inter
est in policy development to 
Robert Cavalier, a CMU phi
losophy professor and director 
of the Universitys Center for 
the Advancement of Applied 
Ethics and Political Philosophy. 
Cavalier also acted as a direc
tor of the previous community 
poll. We hope that the delibera
tive polls will, in the long term, 
encourage students to move 
beyond the groups in which 
theyve traditionally found their 
comfort zones and to engage 
more actively in the issues that 
confront us as a community, 
Cavalier stated in a University 
press release.

Study shows students 
cause computer issues
by Matthew McKee
Staffwriter
According to a recent survey 
published by the Chronicle of 
Higher Education, you are your 
computers worst enemy.
The survey reported that out of 
319 studied incidents, reckless
ness and apathy caused roughly 
40 percent of computer security 
problems. This means that many 
network security problems such 
as viruses, data loss, and remote 
hacker control of a personal 
computer arise from a common 
source that causes more prob
lems than malicious hacking: stu
dent negligence. Students push 
aside their responsibilities to fol
low network policies, and this 
creates far too many problems 
that network security administra
tors want to prevent.
Joel Smith, the vice-provost 
and chief information officer 
for Computing Services at CMU, 
said that most responsibility falls 
in the hands of the users them
selves. He said that the lack of 
student adherence to network 
guidelines causes the vast major
ity of incidents of intrusion. 
Although CMU did not partici
pate in the Chronicles survey, its 
findings may have fallen in line 
with other universities across the 
country.
Smith emphasized that with an 
open environment of computing, 
incidents of intrusion become 
much harder to control. Student 
use of the Internet presents a 
real challenge for Smith and his 
colleagues to monitor. The cam
pus network is not like a corpo
rate structure where everything is 
rigidly controlled, he said, [so] 
this is a joint effort between stu
dents and Computing Services. 
However, he qualified this state
ment by saying, We are still in 
an era of computing responsibil
ity.:.. A lot of weight still falls 
on the individual. This weight 
at CMU means precautions that 
users must take  unless they 
want to see their network con
nections turned off.
Conor McGrath, the University 
of Chicagos manager for network 
security, says that his university 
pursues network security a bit 
differently. They distribute a com
pact disc containing a connec
tivity package and require stu
dents to firewall their machines. 
The laundry list of precautions 
for this institution proves much 
shorter than the to-do list CMU 
gives its residents. McGrath does 
not want to cross the line of stu
dent privacy, but at the same 
time, security has become such

Calling all kid lovers  bring 
your energy and enthusiasm to 
the Leaders in Learning mentor
ship program this spring.
Leaders in Learning is a pro
gram that connects Carnegie 
Mellon student mentors with 
schoolchildren in the third 
through fifth grades in the Hill 
District of Pittsburgh. The pro
gram consists of a variety of 
workshops aimed at fostering 
creativity in elementary school 
kids. The workshops are focused 
on reading and writing but touch 
on areas ranging from theater to 
hip-hop to robotics.
Were looking to overwhelm 
these kids with all sorts of won
derful things, said coordinator 
Ann Wootton. Its really a read

SUMMIT will return 
to campus in January
by Elizabeth Schwartz
Staffwriter
Learning how to snowshoe is 
not a class the average Carnegie 
Mellon student would take. But 
on January 12-14, the opportu
nity does exist.
Come January, Carnegie 
Mellon University will be host 
to the second annual SUMMIT 
retreat. SUMMIT is designed to 
give students opportunities to 
learn seven new skills over three 
days. In the afternoons and eve
nings, participants will take six 
different and unique courses, in
addition to a morning course that 
spans all three days.
SUMMIT is open to all stu
dents, both graduate and under
graduate. For $36, students can 
learn new talents that might not 
be available in their spring sched
ule. It offers a great chance for 
people to have fun before class
es start, said Haseeb Qureshi, 
SUMMIT co-president and a 
senior business administration 
and psychology double major. Its 
a great opportunity to meet new 
people and refresh your view of 
campus.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 14, 2005
Black Greek organizations could change CMU experience for students
GREEKS, from A1 is another, said Alvarado. Some already resolved. between students of different
All the black Greek organizations 
were created to bring together 
people of color, not against people 
not of color.
Academic excellence is an inte
gral part of most NPHC groups. 
Kappas I saw my freshman year 
were focused on school work and 
that came before the fraternity, 
Latimore said. We are trying to 
make sure that young black men 
are taught to achieve. We have 
study sessions on Mondays to Fri
days, 5 pm to 9 pm. We want to 
make sure we can uplift the black 
males at CMU.... We havent had 
a brother at CMU with less than 
a 3.0 [GPA].
Some members see more than 
just academic challenges. A lot 
of people stereotype these orga
nizations to be one thing when it
is another, said Alvarado. Some 
people dont want to join because 
its a stigma.
Another issue for black Greeks 
is bridging the gap between the 
original Greek community here 
at CMU and the black Greek com
munity. I would love to bridge 
the gaps between IFCs [InterFraternity Councils] and NPHC, 
but the question is, where do you 
connect? Green said.
Igino Caifero, a electrical and 
computer engineering senior, 
Greek Community Advisor, and 
a brother of Phi Kappa Theta, 
stated, We are coordinating ef
forts to come together because 
we have a lot to learn from NPHC 
groups. They are all extremely 
well organized and dedicated to 
furthering their organization. I 
hold them with very high regard. 
They have a lot of issues IFCs face
already resolved.
The biggest challenge is the 
low numbers of black people on 
campus, and the idea that all the 
work that you put into bringing 
a black Greek presence on cam
pus might not be carried on when 
you are gone, said Green. In the 
1980s, for example, Delta Sigma 
Theta Sorority, Inc., was the 
only recognized black Greek or
ganization at Carnegie Mellon. 
However, the chapter  which 
included members from Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania, Cha
tham College, and Slippery Rock 
University  went inactive in the 
late 1980s.
Many believe, however, that 
the advantages of black Greek 
organizations will keep them 
going. Black Greek organiza
tions contribute to the University 
and provide common connections
between students of different 
races. It creates an opportunity 
for cultural exchange and a vehi
cle for multicultural interaction, 
said Gloria Hill, Vice-Provost for 
Education at CMUs Qatar cam
pus, and a sister of Delta Sigma 
Theta.
About two percent of the 
Carnegie Mellon minority popula
tion are members of black Greek 
organizations. Famous members 
of black Greek organizations are 
Johnnie Cochran, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Mar
shall, Bill Cosby, Rosa Parks, 
Eleanor Roosevelt, and Nikki 
Giovanni.

Students needed for teaching kids
MENTORS, from A3
shop, but we are looking to get 
them excited... through differ
ent subject matters..
The program is no less a learn
ing experience for University 
students, explained Wootton. 
An important part of the pro
gram is educating CMU stu
dents about the Hill Districts 
rich history. Wootton pointed 
out that there seems to be a 
negative impression of the Hill 
District among college students, 
and this program will hopefully 
help to change that.
Becoming involved in this 
program does not require that 
you have experience working 
with children. Those interested 
will undergo training prior to 
the programs start in order to 
specifically learn how to inter
act and communicate with chil
dren in a manner that pushes 
them to do their best. We do 
really want this to be a learning 
experience for CMU students, 
too, Wootton said. Leadership 
training also includes watching 
films, walking through the Hill 
District, and talking about the
districts history.
Nor does Leaders in Learning 
restrict University students by 
areas of academic interest. Once 
participants are selected through 
the application and interview 
process, the program does its 
best to match the strengths of 
the college students with the 
interests of elementary school 
students.
In fact, the workshops con
sist of much more than tutoring 
children in basics. It wont be 
just sit down and write, said 
Judith Hallinen of the Center 
for School Outreach. Rather, 
Hallinen pointed out that ele
mentary school students will be 
provided with such opportuni
ties as writing and drawing in 
journals and constructing sto
ries with one another.
Hallinen also emphasized the 
importance of the relationship 
in mentorship. Our goal is to 
match University students with 
a specific child. Wed like it to 
be something where they can 
develop a trust and understand
ing, she said. According to 
Hallinen, a Leader in Learning 
should be committed, patient,
and excited.
Leaders in Learning is part 
of Carnegie Mellons Center 
for School Outreach. The cen
ter is responsible for maintain
ing ties between the programs 
and departments at 
Carnegie Mellon and stu
dents at K-12 schools in the 
Pittsburgh community.
The center offers student-tostudent programs in a variety 
of areas, ranging from art to 
music to language. Growing 
Theater, for instance, helps 
middle school youth prepare 
and perform their own produc
tion. This eight-month program 
is an academic elective for CMU 
students and it is open to all 
departments. Program informa
tion is available at the centers 
website (www.cmu.edu/home/ 
education/outreach).
Fun, creativity, and creat
ing good relationships are the 
highlights for both University 
and elementary school stu
dents alike. We very much 
want this to be a learning 
and growing experience for 
students.... Its very much a 
partnership, Wootton said.

SUMMIT grows to give 
more unique courses
SUMMIT, from A3
Last year, SUMMIT drew 120 
students back to campus to par
ticipate in classes. These mini
courses ranged from furniture 
building to a culinary arts class, 
where students learned to cook 
a four-course meal. Among 
the 40 classes slated for this 
upcoming year are glassblowing, furniture making, and a 
poker course, possibly taught 
by a professional player. The 
classes are taught by Carnegie 
Mellon faculty, staff, and stu
dents, as well as professionals 
in Pittsburgh.
Richard Yao, a junior in the 
English department, remembers 
his SUMMIT experience last 
year as enjoyable. SUMMITS 
kind of like a week of sum
mer camp between semesters, 
he said.
Qureshi noted that this year, 
he and other SUMMIT plan
ners were able to do a lot more 
thanks to Roger Ma, a 2005 
business administration gradu
ate who created SUMMIT for 
his Fifth-Year Scholars project. 
Weve gotten more coopera
tion from the University and
more credibility, Qureshi said.
As of last week, over 160 stu
dents have registered to take 
part, including 10 students 
from Carnegie Mellons Qatar 
campus. This years large 
response is due in part to 
SUMMITS six-person executive 
board and their effective mar
keting campaign.
Among those registered, 
Siobhan Halloran, a sophomore 
studying chemical engineer
ing, is looking forward to her 
first SUMMIT experience. Im 
really excited about it, she 
said. I think its going to be a 
lot of fun.
Qureshi hopes to make 
SUMMIT a large-scale event as 
it gains popularity. Were try
ing to expand it. Schools like 
MIT and Berkeley have stuff 
like this thats [on the scale 
of] Orientation  week-long 
events.
If you get a chance, Yao 
said, try to do SUMMIT at least 
once.

Survey shows students split on nukes
RESULTS, from A3
intense radiation, all occuring 
instantaneously. Detonation of 
the smallest nuclear weapon in 
Americas arsenal (100 kilotons) 
would result in seven square 
miles of complete destruction, 
30 square miles of severe fires, 
and intense radiation over a 
much larger area.
Nuclear weapons are effective 
at eliminating their targets, but 
they also guarantee severe col
lateral damage. While the ef
fects of biological and chemi
cal weaponry are deadly, they 
are hard to compare with the 
effects of a nuclear explosion. 
Therefore, a nuclear retaliation 
to a biological or chemical attack 
could cause a drastic escalation 
in warfare. Unless this was the 
desired outcome, it is unlikely 
the U.S. would respond in such 
a manner.
U.S. retaliation against a nu
clear attack launched by another
nation would therefore appear 
to be a more likely reaction. 
However, it is difficult to imagine 
a nation desperate enough to 
launch a nuclear attack and risk 
the consequences. Maintaining 
the U.S. nuclear arsenal would 
be necessary to prevent un
checked usage of nuclear force 
by the nations that have weap
ons against nations that have 
none.
With terrorists, no such 
checks exist. If a terrorist group 
were to come into possession of 
a nuclear weapon and launch 
an attack, nuclear force would 
not be capable of deterring such 
an act nor could it threaten any 
sort of retribution against the 
attackers.
While the U.S. use of nuclear 
weapons to eliminate a rogue 
states WMD program would be 
effective, it is by no means neces
sary, as demonstrated by Israel 
in 1981. The Israeli government 
used conventional weapons to
destroy Iraqs Osirak reactor and 
justified it by stating: Under 
no circumstances will we allow 
an enemy to develop weapons 
of mass destruction against our 
people. Even if a rogue state 
had a more robust WMD pro
gram than that of Iraq in 1981, 
it is unclear how effective a nu
clear attack would be if a WMD 
program were dispersed. To war
rant the use of nuclear force, a 
government would have to con
clude not only that conventional 
weapons would be ineffective, 
but also that eliminating the 
threat was worth the collateral 
damage.
Unlike 1945, nuclear politics 
today have transformed into a 
delicate situation in which the 
slightest movement forces every 
other nation to compensate. 
To exercise nuclear force today 
would take an extremely wellsynchronized act in order to pre
vent tipping a balanced nuclear 
society.
Its not the 
computer, 
its you
SECURITY, from A3
a major issue that his office has 
taken responsibility for the secu
rity of the dorm networks to a 
certain point.
McGrath, like Smith, admitted 
that the vast majority of inci
dents stemmed from user Care
lessness, but, he said, Students 
are worried about being students. 
Theyre not trying to become 
computer security experts. He 
said his office currently wants to 
develop programs to raise user 
awareness and reduce the num
ber of security incidents, but he 
sees a problem in convincing stu
dents to turn away from merely 
skipping policies and ignoring 
advice. He identified a click
through culture that needs a 
dramatic reduction.
Both McGrath and Smith 
brought up the necessity of good 
dialogue between students and 
computing security officials 
that will help promote student 
responsiveness to security prob
lems. McGrath said, A com
puter is not as easy to use as a 
toaster. Unfortunately, students 
want to treat their computers as 
appliances.
Strauss wins award 
for public finance
STRAUSS, from A1
good education.
Strauss has been active at 
both the federal and state levels. 
He was involved in the resolu
tion of several major crises, such 
as New Yorks financial troubles 
in the 1970s. He also rewrote 
West Virginias state business 
tax system.
He has been active in applying 
his expertise in public finance to 
Pittsburghs problems, which 
he described as being worse 
than New Yorks past troubles. 
The raw numbers are really 
scary, Strauss said. Pittsburgh 
was deemed distressed by 
the state of Pennsylvania in De
cember 2003, according to the  
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. John 
Murray, the head of the state 
oversight board, said, We did 
not talk about what some peo
ple call the elephant in the room 
today.... We didnt talk about 20 
percent of the budget going to 
pay that debt service, accord
ing to the Tribune-Review. The 
city of Pittsburgh has $1 billion 
in debt, paying interest of about 
$90 million annually.
Strauss has given public
speeches, radio interviews, and 
testimony before the Pittsburgh 
City Council. He has offered de
tailed policy solutions as well 
as general guidelines, which 
can be found online at www. 
andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f. He 
is also very concerned about 
education reform in Pittsburgh 
public schools.
In communicating with 
members of the Pennsylvania 
state government as well as lo
cal officials, Strauss said, anal
ysis and suggestions have fallen 
on deaf ears. He added, Pitts
burgh is small. It doesnt have 
the political influence to get the 
state involved. The city is going 
to limp on for another five to 10 
years. It will be taken advantage 
of by the state repeatedly. Its 
unfortunate for the University, 
because this is where we are.
Strausss appraisal of Pitts
burghs situation is not entirely 
grim, however. He is becoming 
more hopeful as the political 
climate of Pittsburgh changes. 
Once some of the political fric
tion is overcome, Strauss thinks 
that the city can make pro
gress toward a financial 
recovery.
CMU celebrates Asian Heritage Month
HERITAGE, from A1
campuses.
CMU students and faculty have 
also been enthusiastic and coop
erative.
Asian Heritage Month is not 
only a month for Asians. Its meant 
to engage people in fun, interest
ing, and educational events, Suh 
said.
AHM events have enjoyed high 
participation from both Asian and 
non-Asian students. Suh said that 
attendance is high because a lot 
of different organizations are do
ing a really good job and lot of 
hard work.
One of the hallmarks of this 
years AHM was last Fridays Cul
ture Night in Rangos Ballroom. 
The fourth annual event, using 
the theme Born Identity, was 
sponsored by the Taiwanese Stu
dent Association. According to 
the Carnegie Mellon Multicul
tural Initiatives website, Culture 
Night is a chance for all cultures 
to share their traditions and an 
opportunity for all of us to experi
ence. Through Culture Night, the 
Taiwanese Student Association 
hopes to bring unity in our diverse 
community.
Culture Night coordinator Mike
Kuo said the nights performances 
were a display of both traditional 
and modern Asian and AsianAmerican performance styles. 
The event featured cultural per
formances by 13 organizations 
and included an eclectic mix of 
short film, original poetry, free
style, chamber music, and dance.
Senior Amy Malangyoan per
formed a traditional Tinikling
dance with the Barkada Club, a 
Filipino interest group seeking 
recognition on campus.
We are not just a group of Fili
pinos. We are about Filipino inter
ests. We want others to be inter
ested, too, Malangyoan said.
The club is an example of the 
cooperation between cultures 
that brought Culture Night and 
Asian Heritage Month together.

Holiday charity benefits locals
OUTREACH, from A1 
said.
Students and faculty have the 
opportunity to personalize the 
baskets by adding table decora
tions and notes; because of this, 
Smith said, each basket comes 
with its own flavor.
Greater Love Outreach, an 
inner-city non-profit organiza
tion, takes pride in its mission 
to meet the needs of those who 
need the help most, according to 
Robert Higgs, its Outreach Min
ister. The program is one of the 
three organizations benefiting 
from this years Thanksgiving Bas
ket Outreach. Last year, Greater 
Love received 20 baskets. Higgs is 
excited about this years impact.
Last year we took pictures of the 
families while they were receiving 
their baskets. It was a very special 
time, he said.
Similar to Greater Love, Rain
bow Kitchen Community Services 
supports low-income families 
and individuals; it is also benefit
ing from this years basket drive. 
Sandra Wolfe, the program direc
tor of Rainbow Kitchen, believes 
that what makes this program 
special is that it exceeds what is 
needed to provide a family with a 
Thanksgiving dinner. Wolfe said, 
It [the program] allows them the 
opportunity to sit down together 
and know that there are people 
in the world who give a gift from 
the heart with no expectations in 
return.
Smith agrees. We could just 
be giving money out, but theres 
something about the outward 
expression of putting together 
a basket that is really special, 
she said. f 
Wolfe added, This is a great 
example that the youth of today 
have love and compassion that 
will sustain us for generations to 
come if it can be passed down. 
Baskets are due at the Student 
Development Office in Morewood Gardens A Tower by noon 
on Monday, November 21. For

Staffwriter
IBM and the Association for 
Computing Machinery (ACM) 
have announced the kickoff of 
the 30th annual International 
Collegiate Programming Con
test (ICPC), the largest and most 
prestigious programming contest 
in the world. Teams of three stu
dents were challenged to use their 
programming skills and mental 
endurance to solve complex, realworld problems under a grueling 
deadline, while vying for a spot 
at the Contests World Finals in 
San Antonio, Texas, April 9-13, 
2006. Carnegie Mellon had two 
teams participate in this years 
ACM East Central North America 
Regional Programming Contest.
CMUs Dragons team, consist
ing of Jeff Schroder, a junior ECE 
major, Evan Danaher, a sopho
more CS major, and Andrew 
Warshaver, also a sophomore CS 
major, placed fifth, while CMUs 
Cardinals team placed 10th. The 
four teams that finished ahead of 
CMU were from the University 
of Waterloo and the University 
of Toronto, placing CMU as the 
third university in the region.
Over five hours, each team 
had to complete eight real-world 
problems. Competitors were only 
given a problem statement  not 
a requirements document. They 
had example test data, but no 
access to the judges test data or 
acceptance criteria. Teammates 
collaborated to rank the diffi
culty of the problems, determine 
the requirements, and build soft
ware systems to solve the prob
lems under the scrutiny of expert 
judges.
Some of the problems required 
the knowledge of a 200-level 
computer science course. Other 
problems required an under
standing of advanced algorithms. 
The judging is strict. Each incor
rect solution submitted is given 
a specific time penalty; the team
that solves the most problems 
with the fewest attempts in the 
least cumulative time is declared 
the winner. CMUs Dragons 
team managed to solve every 
problem.
Professor Greg Kesden and Dr. 
Eugene Fink are the advisors for 
Carnegie Mellons teams. Advis
ing this competition has given 
me a chance to work with the 
best, most competitive students, 
said Kesden, a sixth-year advisor. 
Im a people person; I love work
ing with others. This has been a 
great opportunity to get involved 
with students who do research, 
and there is nothing better than 
getting involved with students 
who want to be the best.
Fink is also coaching the teams. 
He wanted to teach a competi
tion programming technology 
elective which gives credit, in
centive, and practice to students 
interested in these competitions.
Kesden admitted to being very 
nervous during the competi
tion  he thought the team had 
barely solved any problems.
We solved the first problem 
very quickly. And we knew how to 
solve the others but we couldnt 
get them to work, explained An
drew Warshaver, Dragons team 
member. They had numerous 
bugs that prevented the programs 
from running. Halfway through 
the competition we were only in 
13th place. With an hour left a 
few schools had already finished 
all eight problems. We knew that 
if we wanted to go to world finals 
we would have to solve all eight 
problems. In the last hour, we 
pulled our act together.
Since IBM became the sponsor 
in 1997, participation in the ICPC 
has increased by a factor of five, 
growing to involve several tens of 
thousands of the finest students 
and faculty in computing disci
plines at over 1582 universities 
from 71 countries on six conti
nents.
IBM is proud to sponsor such a 
prestigious competition. We do
it to invest in the education of our 
youth, said Doug Heintzman, 
Director of Technical Strategy, 
IBM Software, and sponsorship 
executive of the ICPC. We also 
get access to the best, brightest 
computer and engineering stu
dents in the world.
The competition is meant to 
give students more than just 
. competitive programming expe
rience. For example, last year, 
IBM brought Blue Jean, the 
worlds fastest supercomputer, to 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
Students were given the oppor
tunity to program on this spe
cialized computer and have their 
programs compete against each 
other.
The ICPC also promotes IBM 
as a possible career choice. In
fact, over 95 of the world cham
pionship winners thus far have 
been employed at IBM as interns, 
full-time employees, or interns 
in their Extreme Blue Internship 
program.
Each year the ICPC gets more 
competitive. The top two uni
versities from each region are 
guaranteed a spot in the World 
Finals. If a team finishes third, 
the judges can decide, based on 
a set of criteria, to give that team 
a wild card to go to the world 
finals. The team has the oppor
tunity to optimize a problem or 
mitigate anomalies and be reas
sessed for the finals. Historically, 
wild cards have been given to the 
largest regions, including CMUs 
region. Since the Dragons placed 
third, there is a good chance the
team can make it to the world fi
nals. However, they will not find 
out until December.
Last year, the ACM-ICPC world 
finals took place in Shanghai, 
China, where the team from 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
emerged as world champions. 
Winners of the competition re
ceive awards and prizes ranging 
from laptops to scholarships.
Those at the top are very im
pressed. When I go to these 
competitions, it is such a thrill, 
said Heintzman. These competi
tions really give students an op
portunity to harness and focus 
their potential into creative out
put. It is very heady to be there 
and be a part of harnessing that 
potential.

Dakosaurus stumps 
the Crocodile Hunter
Scientists may have just un
earthed the Tyrannosaurus 
rex of crocodiles. Nicknamed 
Godzilla, the Dakosaurus andiniensis was approximately four 
meters long and stood in stark 
contrast to the crocodiles we see 
today. Researchers have called it 
the most bizarre marine croco
dile known to date  a mon
strous creature with flipper-like 
feet and a fishlike tail that domi
nated the seas 135 million years 
ago.
Its like a crocodile with a di
nosaur head on it, says James 
Clark, a professor of biology at 
George Washington University. 
The prehistoric crocodile prob
ably occupied a niche similar to 
modern-day killer whales and 
ripped apart prey with its 52 ser
rated teeth. Im sure it wasnt 
nice, said Diego Pol, a researcher 
at Ohio State University.

Scientists turn to 
animals in order to 
understand sleep
A team of scientists at Indi
ana State University has taken a 
novel approach to the study of 
sleep. Armed with brain-wave 
recording wires, the group is 
part of a growing faction of sci
entists using animals to better 
understand human behavior. 
Originally thought to be unique 
to vertebrates, recent studies 
showed that both honeybees and 
crayfish sleep as well. This dis
covery has led many scientists to 
look at sleep as an evolutionary 
phenomenon. In this way, they 
hope to better understand the 
primordial functions of sleep and 
why it exists in the first place.

Early detection of fDown syndrome 
is key
According to a new study, tests 
done during the first trimester of 
pregnancy are better at identify
ing fetuses with Down syndrome 
than tests done later in preg
nancy. The New England Journal 
of Medicine reports that tests con
ducted during the first trimester 
detected 87 percent of fetuses 
with the extra chromosome, as 
opposed to 81 percent in the 
second trimester. The study, 
which spanned 15 hospitals and 
involved over 38,000 women, is 
the governments most compre
hensive effort to date in helping 
expectant couples identify the 
risk of their childs developing 
Down syndrome. Down syn
drome affects more than two 
million people worldwide, and 
occurs once in every 700 to 900

Lost and found  
and then lost again
NASAs Mars Polar Lander, 
which disappeared six years ago, 
is still lost. In 2000, scientists 
thought they had spotted the 
missing lander when the Mars 
Global Surveyor sent back pic
tures of a white dot (thought to 
be sunshine bouncing off metal) 
inside a black dot (thought to be 
the blast marks from the landers 
rocket engine). Another look 
this September revealed that the 
white and black marks were no 
longer there. Five years would 
be too little time for the dust to 
obscure the lander completely, 
said Michael Malin, president of 
Malin Space Science Systems, 
which operates the Global Sur
veyor camera. Instead, Malin 
blamed the error on a camera 
glitch. It appears to have been a 
noisy pixel, he said. Somewhere, 
Martians are happily playing 
with a NASA lander.

Social robots could help diagnose and treat autistic children
by Christine deBriffault
Staffwriter
For the past four years, Brian Scassellati 
has been researching the uses of human
oid robots that can interact with people by 
natural social cues. Scassellati spoke last 
Friday on Social Robots, Social Develop
ment and Social Disorders, in which he 
demonstrated the uses of social robots 
when applied to autism diagnosis and 
therapy.
Scassellati, a computer science profes
sor at Yale, developed a social robot named 
Kismet. Kismet has a physical body and is 
autonomous.
The temporal correlations between 
motor activity and perceptual input discriminate [the robot] self from other time 
constants determined autonomously, 
Scassellati said. In this way, Kismet can 
distinguish itself from other things. A lot 
of philosophers argue that a sense of self 
is the basis of consciousness, said Piper 
Lincoln, a sophomore ethics and history 
major. Its pretty startling to think of the 
implications of this research.
Kismet has auditory, visual, and expres
sive systems that enable it to participate 
in human-social interaction and to dem
onstrate simulated human emotion. It re
ciprocates emotion through facial expres
sions such as moving its ears, eyebrows, 
eyelids, lips, jaw, and head. Scassellatis 
goal is to use these robots to teach social 
skills to children with autism.
Autism is a brain disorder that interferes
with a persons ability to communicate and 
relate to others. A child with autism fails 
to respond or interact like other children 
of the same age.
Robots can help diagnose autism with 
hard-core results, Scassellati said, by 
documenting how the child reacts in a 
social context, using speech and facial 
expressions. For example, a typical child 
loses interest in a generic robot; he or she 
prefers interacting with a face. However, 
an autistic child has no preference for a 
regular face over a scrambled face and 
does not lose interest at all.
Scassellatis robots are programmed to 
recognize social cues specific to autism 
and can provide Scassellati with quantita
tive information that can be used by physi
cians to diagnose, track the progress of a
patient, and make comparisons between 
patients within a population.
Though Kismet seems like a step for
ward in medical technology, others are 
skeptical. Im sort of afraid of how much 
the kids will be treated like science proj
ects, said Phoebe Wu, a senior informa
tion systems major. Because when youre 
using these robots to collect data ... what 
else can you do? You dont want the focus 
to shift from helping kids to getting more 
data.
Scassellati said that though his results 
as of now seem solid, he used a relatively 
low number of subjects. Therefore, he 
does not want to give false hope to fami
lies with autistic children. His research is 
preliminary, and there are still many more 
variables to consider.
How Things Work: Fall Leaves
Sean Conroy
My affection for autumn 
leaves is like a CS nerds love for 
Linux. Have you even noticed 
those gorgeous red maples next 
to Warner, the stunning orange 
foliage near the tennis courts, 
or the yellow glory of the stately 
oaks along Baker?
And if you think a few oak 
trees are nice, try a walk in 
Schenley Park, where a trail is 
transformed into a stairway to 
heaven. Lest this piece descend 
any further into effusive adjec
tives, I now present the science 
of dead leaves: that is, why 
leaves turn those pretty colors 
that they do.
So suppose that youre God, 
and youve decided to give 
Earths weather a little variety. 
Youve already managed to get 
the sun in place, with the Earth 
and its moon in a fairly circular 
orbit around it. The question 
is: Do you stretch earths orbit 
to create seasons, or do you tilt 
the earth? For reasons of good 
astrophysics, the answer turns 
out to be the latter.
In fact, the earths orbit is 
really quite circular: Our dis
tance from the sun differs by
about three percent over the 
course of a year. The reason for 
our seasons is the tilt  23.45 
degrees of it, to be precise. 
During the colder months, one 
side of the earth is tilted away 
from the sun, making the days 
shorter and reducing the heat
ing efficiency of sunlight.
Of course, the only thing 
trees care about is the fact that 
in autumn its colder and the 
nights are longer. When the 
length of the night reaches a 
certain threshold, cells near the 
juncture of the leaf and the stem 
begin to undergo a form of cell 
division called meiosis, block
ing the flow of nutrients to the 
leaf.
Sunlight is then free to break 
down the chlorophyll molecules 
in the aging leaf. However, the 
nutrients in these chlorophyll 
fragments  magnesium ions 
and nitrogen-rich proteins  
are still useful to the tree. These 
compounds are reabsorbed by 
, the tree and recycled. In effect, 
the greenness of the leaves is 
drained back into the tree.
But a leaf does not contain 
only chlorophyll. There are also 
red and purple pigments known 
as anthocyanins which are
a
manufactured from the sugars 
trapped in the leaf. Also present 
are pigment molecules that aid 
chlorophyll in capturing light: 
yellow xanthophylls and orange 
carotenoids. When the chloro
phyll is gone, these pigments 
are not recycled, but left behind 
as waste. And what waste it is! 
If only other kinds of garbage 
were so attractive.
After the last of the miner
als have been mined from the

leaf, cells near the leaf stem 
produce the enzyme pectinase. 
Pectinase causes the major
ity of the cells at the base of 
the stem toseparate from each 
other. (Think seppuku.) The 
weight of the leaf then rips the 
remaining cells apart, and the 
leaf falls quietly to the ground. 
Some trees retain their leaves 
through much of the winter, but 
the leaves do not remain color
ful for long. Just as chlorophyll
I
breaks down quickly, so do the 
other color pigments, once they 
are exposed to sunlight and the 
autumn chill. The only remain
ing pigments are tannins, which 
are brown. All good things must 
come to an end.
A beautiful fall is a rare 
thing, requiring a delicate set of 
weather conditions. The most 
colorful autumns require warm 
days, lots of sunlight, and cold 
nights. Brisk temperatures let 
chlorophyll be broken down 
faster, and promote the forma
tion of anthocyanins. However, 
an early frost will hinder the 
process responsible for manu
facturing anthocyanins, as will 
too little rain. Too much rain 
may cause the leaves to be lost 
before they become fully col
ored.
So be grateful for what you 
get. You may wish you were 
living in sunny California, but 
theres no-place like Pennsylva
nia for a gorgeous fall season. 
Take a minute and spend some 
time enjoying these fall colors. 
If you want to get really crazy, 
you could be drinking cider, eat
ing caramel apples, or roasting 
chestnuts. It doesnt get much 
better than that.

Local young women refuse to be objectified
Abercrombie girl-cott praiseworthy for its reliance on consumerism, not legislation
Who needs brains when you have 
these?
Thats the slogan on one of two T-shirts 
Abercrombie & Fitch will no longer sell 
after the retailer conceded to a group of 
western Pennsylvania high school stu
dents. The students girl-cott sent the 
message: We wont stand for this.
National television media jumped on 
the story  some of the girls were in
terviewed on CNN and the Today Show, 
and others across the country took up 
the protest. The medias interest in the 
story undoubtedly played a major role in 
the boycotts success.
The young women, 23 members of the 
Allegheny County Girls as Grantmakers 
program, should be applauded. They 
were assertive in standing up against a 
national corporation that had promul
gated what they perceived to be anti
girl and divisive messages.
We would never let anyone exploit 
us, so why are we exploiting ourselves? 
the girls asked in their press release. So 
join us in our national girl-cott effort to
encourage A&F to stop selling these rags 
and instead start selling some more girlempowering wear.
But the editorial pages of some col
lege and regional newspapers have been 
cool  and in some cases even cold
 toward the outspoken girls.
In a highfalutin editorial published 
on November 9, the staff of The Harvard 
Crimson chided the girl-cotters, writing, 
[Their] demand that Abercrombie 
discontinue producing these T-shirts 
was contrary to the spirit of free en
terprise. Untrue: The girl-cotters were 
working entirely within its framework. 
There were no pleas for legislative in
tervention, though at least one conser
vative congressman tried to jump on 
the bandwagon. Their protest hinges 
on the crux of a consumer society: 
If you dont like it, dont buy it. The 
market determines whats successful. 
Accusations that the girl-cotters are act
ing contrary to that spirit verges on 
GOP-like spin.
Furthermore, The Harvard Crimsons
editorial stated that the protest is proof 
that some Americans incorrectly be
lieve that womens equality has not yet 
progressed ... enough to permit young 
women to express themselves freely. 
What, exactly, were the girl-cotters do
ing if not expressing themselves freely? 
They certainly werent preventing any
one elses free expression.
The Pitt News belittled the girls efforts, 
too. Their November 7 editorial offered 
a qualified commendation, claiming that 
their efforts could have been directed to
ward more pertinent issues. Yes, there 
are innumerable important issues that 
women face, but these girls took an issue 
immediately relevant to their lives and 
made positive change.
Young women are capable of decid
ing for themselves what they choose to 
wear; the girl-cotters have proven that 
to be the case. But they should keep in 
mind that, while a battle has been won, 
companies like Abercrombie will con
tinue to capitalize on controversy. That 
has yet to be defeated.
Race not ready to be a non-issue
French riots reminiscent of Katrinas chaos; United States should take heed
For many Americans, the French seem 
inexplicably different, embodying eveiything that is European. Recently, how
ever, more astute citizens have seen that 
we have something very grave in com
mon with France: a national underclass 
that is unrecognized, underappreciated, 
and now reacting in a horrific but sadly 
familiar way.
The Parisian riots have revealed the 
disenfranchisement and dissatisfaction 
of a growing class of French who are 
predominately young, and of foreign 
heritage. Racial, generational, and eco
nomic aspects of their inequality can
not be ignored, neither by the French 
government nor by the international 
community.
Frances efforts at eradicating racism 
have backfired. After the carnage of the 
Algerian Revolution in the 1950s and 
1960s, France adopted, at least exter
nally, a policy of strict racial egalitari
anism. Housing discrimination and job 
preference are punished under Frances 
criminal law, and it is illegal to publicly 
contest the existence of crimes against 
humanity in WWII. However, in their
effort to prevent race from becoming 
a contentious issue, France attempted 
to erase all forms of racial difference 
from its records; it is illegal for focus 
or census groups to collect any kind of 
ethnic data.
These well-intentioned but misguided 
laws, which coincided with an influx 
of North and West African immigrants, 
have resulted in a subgroup of French 
whose differences are ignored by the 
government but exploited by their 
native-born neighbors. Add to that a 
rising level of unemployment among 
young men  most of the rioters are 
male and between the ages of 12 to 25
 and you have a guaranteed recipe for 
uprising.
This uprising was not unexpected. 
Although the riots have spread as quickly 
as their characteristic fires, there was un
rest long before its explosion on October 
27. According to the New York Times, 
more than 80 cars per day were set on 
fire in the country throughout 2005.
Americans might see a sad parallel be
tween the Parisian riots and the disaster 
surrounding Hurricane Katrina, in
which an entire citys population  pre
dominantly poor and African-American
 was the collective victim of igno
rance and poor rescue strategy. Many 
people have accused the governments 
slow reaction as the result of a deepseated racial and economic bias. Now, as 
poor immigrant communities go up in 
flames, the French government has gone 
from keeping total silence  President 
Jacques Chirac has barely addressed the 
issue in public  to confusedly fumbling 
for recourse. Interior Minister Nicolas 
Sarkozy suggested the deportation of all 
rioters, regardless of whether they are 
French citizens. Clearly, French officials 
are doing one heckuva job.
Obviously, rioting and violence are 
unacceptable means of voicing polit
ical discontent. However, such a ter
rible incident is indicative of Frances 
unwillingness to acknowledge the poor, 
the young, and those in a racial minority. 
Both France and the United States 
should think carefully about this event, 
and take heed of Tony Blairs response to 
the fiery violence: You should never be 
complacent about these things.

Bush deserves credit 
for our strong economy
Benjamin Hackett
The current media cycle, with its 
unrelenting Hate Bush agenda, 
has blatantly ignored the substantial 
economic growth of the past few 
years. When Bush entered office, 
he inherited an economy regressing 
into recession caused by the dot-com 
collapse and the illogic of investing the 
peacetime surplus back into govern
ment programs. Shortly after taking 
office, September 11 happened and 
dealt another fiscal uppercut on the 
economy.
Recently, after a decent post-9/11 
recovery, the economy was dealt an
other blow. Alan Greenspan, in tes
timony given to the Joint Economic 
Committee, remarked, The economy 
suffered significant shocks in late sum
mer and early autumn. Greenspan 
is referring to the devastation of 
Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, which 
brought unemployment and massive 
capital damage.
In addition, shutting down many oil 
refineries reduced refinement capaci
ties and led to $3-per-gallon gas prices 
nationwide. The short term energy 
spike ate away at families disposable 
incomes. Even with all these obstacles, 
the economy continued expansion. 
One can reasonably wonder how this 
economy is enjoying the longest sus
tained rate of expansion in 20 years.
Greenspan tells us that These events 
are likely to exert a drag on employment 
and production in the near term and to 
add to the upward pressures on the 
general price level. But the economic 
fundamentals remain firm, and the U.S. 
economy appears to retain important 
forward momentum. Employment did 
suffer in the near term, yet rebounded. 
The Labor Department reported that
tive in convincing people how awful 
the economy is. In fact, brainwashing 
those still self-abusive enough to sub
ject themselves to mainstream media 
has resulted in, as Bloomberg.com 
reports, the University of Michigan 
report[ing] that ... consumer confi
dence had dropped to the lowest level 
in 13 years.
In the 90s, when Clinton was in 
office, consumer confidence in an 
economy fueled by speculation and 
a squandering of the peacetime sur
plus was always high. Clinton faced 
similar issues as Bush concerning al
legations  and in both cases some 
rightful ones  of corruption within 
the administration. However, Clinton 
was a master politician. Concerned 
with only preserving his legacy, Clinton 
never responded to the attacks on the 
United States that occurred under his 
watch, and thus the United States did 
not enter into a war in Afghanistan or 
Iraq. This allowed his administration to 
focus its machine on demonizing spe
cial prosecutor Kenneth Starr and any 
other administration opponents.
Clinton, in fact, was able to persuade 
public opinion in a way Bush does not.
While much of Clintons presidency 
was smoke and mirrors, Bushs prob
lems are all very real. It seems that 
the President is missing out on a per
fect political opportunity to benefit 
from the expansion of the economy. 
Considering the numerous issues sur
rounding Iraq and internally within 
the White House, it is quite astonishing 
that the President cannot stand firm on 
a strong economy.
Conservatives must maintain intellec
tual honesty. This is how conservatives 
lead by initiatives, thoughtful debate, 
and progress. That said, Republicans 
in Congress and President Bush have 
squandered a great opportunity to put 
the final nail in the Democratic coffin.
The economys expansion has been 
predicated on the Bush tax cuts. Tax
For those of you keeping track at home, this is the 
longest period of extended economic expansion 
since the 1980s. All this positive news occurs, and 
Bush receives little credit.
the United States economy added 
56,000 jobs in October. In addition, the 
report revised job losses in September 
down from 35,000 to 8000. The job
less rate dropped as well, sliding from 
5.1 percent down to 5.0 percent.
The Federal Reserve is slightly wor
ried about inflation. However, the WalMart economy is keeping it down. 
Companies (as described by the right) 
or Evil Corporations (as described by 
the left) such as Wal-Mart keep eco
nomic efficiency high with rock-bot
tom prices and strong wage controls. 
Since inflation is a concern, the Federal 
Reserve  for the 12th consecutive 
time  raised interest rates, this time 
to 4 percent. Even with a rising rate en
vironment, the economy plugs along.
The United States economy grew 
by nearly 4 percent this past quarter. 
This is the 10th consecutive quarter 
with growth at or above 3 percent. For 
those of you keeping track at home, 
this is the longest period of extended 
economic expansion since the 1980s. 
All this positive news occurs, and Bush 
receives little credit.
This is the case because, as 
Bloomberg.com reports, In an Oct.
24-26 Gallup Organization poll, 71 
percent said the economy was only 
fair or poor, and 66 percent said it 
was getting worse. By the numbers 
this is not true in the least. However, 
the current media cycle has been effec
cuts fuel growth. While Bush has had 
a difficult time controlling his spend
ing, we would be significandy worse 
off, and the deficits would be signifi
candy higher, if the tax cuts were not 
in place. There are still alarming trends 
in spending that need to be addressed. 
What is the economic medicine re
quired in order to put money back into 
Americans pockets? Cut Spending and 
Cut Taxes.
The recently reenergized conserva
tive movement must continue to spur 
Republicans in Congress and President 
Bush. Congress and this White House 
have been awful, by any set of stan
dards, at controlling spending. Even ac
cepting the fact that defense spending 
is necessary, the growth of domestic 
programs is too large to ignore.
The United States economy would 
really boom if the federal budget were 
cut by even a small percent. Trimming 
the budget is tantamount to a tax cut. 
Suddenly, the United States would find 
itself in a situation where each and 
every individual has more money in his 
pocket through tax cuts and spending 
reductions. At this point, Republicans 
would have moved back to their con
servative roots, and subsequently their 
political fortunes would increase.

JFC ready to 
run with new 
procedures
The Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) season is coming up very 
quickly and there are many 
important and positive changes 
this year that I am excited to tell 
you about.
As the other member of student 
governments executive branch, 
the Vice-President of Finance, I 
only come out into the spotlight at 
the beginning and end of the JFC. 
Over the next few weeks, the JFC 
will be working hard to run a new 
process: funding eligibility, which 
was part of student governments 
reforms last year.
One of the biggest changes 
was the replacement of funded 
recognition. Instead of individual 
approval by the Student Senate 
or the Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA), with funding eligibility, 
the JFC makes recommendations 
and Senate and GSA later approve 
them. Funding eligibility gives 
similar rights to groups as funded 
recognition (the ability to ask for 
an annual student government 
subsidy), but it must be renewed 
yearly.
Next week, the JFC will be meet
ing for the first time to set up 
for the funding eligibility process, 
which every organization on cam
pus will have to go through if they 
want to be funded through the 
JFC in the spring. We will have 
two mandatory information ses
sions before Thanksgiving for 
organization leaders; those dates 
will be announced soon and sent 
out to every organization on re
cord. At those meetings, we will re
view the entire application process, 
the required paperwork needed 
for the committee, and how we 
want the paperwork.
At the least, we will be asking 
for updated copies of organiza
tions constitutions, officer contact 
information, demonstration of in
terest, statement of the mission or 
special interest of the group and 
goals for that mission or special 
interest, and other administrative 
details. As before, no organization 
may receive funding eligibility if it 
was not recognized the preceding 
semester.
The limitation on academic, po
litical, and religious groups being 
a part of the process has been 
lifted. However, they, or any other 
group, will not be able to ask for 
money for academic, political, or 
religious events.
The current plan is to have final 
recommendations for funding eli
gibility done before the last day of 
fall classes, so organizations may 
review the decision of JFC and 
possibly appeal the decision dur
ing early January. Final approval 
by Senate and GSA would happen 
by end of January. After that, Ill 
be writing again to talk about the 
spring budgeting process.

PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Folasakin Oyeleye and Magali Duzant
Over the last few weeks, I have read 
two articles, both appearing in The 
Tartans Forum section, about the ArabIsraeli conflict. Both articles had valid 
points. At the same time, both articles 
seemed to come from a perspective not 
interested in compromise. This really 
bothered me.
I spent my last three months of 
high school on a program in Israel. 
Throughout that program, I heard from 
both Palestinian and Israeli speakers. It 
was clear that both sides had legitimate 
points to which I could relate. I do not 
intend to claim that Fve heard the com
plete spectrum of opinions on the subject 
 that would take years. In some ways, 
I felt that maybe there was something 
wrong with the fact that even after hear
ing and seeing so much, I could not 
say that I had come up with a concrete 
opinion. In many ways, I was even more 
confused after the experience than I was 
before.
I think this was a direct effect of not 
simply hearing but actually listening to 
multiple sides of the conflict. I realized 
that everyone had his own demands, but
that those demands didnt have to exist 
in disregard of each other.
Reading those articles left me with 
a sick feeling. If we cant attempt to 
have a simple discussion on the conflict 
between students with different opinions 
on a college campus in America, how can 
we ever hope to have peace in the Middle 
East? Call me an idealist, but the conver
sation has to start somewhere.
Fm in the process of organizing a com
mittee for exactly this purpose: a healthy 
dialogue to discuss the Arab-Israeli con
flict, and hopefully come to a conclusion 
or procedure as a result of the conver
sation. From what I understand, there 
is already a committee similar to the 
one Tm proposing, but it is composed 
entirely of faculty. What Fm proposing is 
simple in theory, but may prove difficult 
in reality. Fm willing to accept that fact 
and deal with it, but not let it hinder the 
creation of the committee. Fm asking 
anyone interested in the idea to please 
contact me.

An issue that arises at most private institu
tions, not excluding this campus, is the lack 
of student involvement in decision-making 
processes. If we are to continue on a path to 
increase social standards on this campus, as 
has been the spoken goal of the administra
tion for the past decade, it is my belief that 
we should look to students to be involved in 
making policy and not allow blanket legisla
tion by the administration on significant 
issues. The reason for my disgruntlement 
with the decision to take minors off of di
plomas isnt necessarily because of the given 
reasoning but mainly the methods by which 
the policy was enacted.
From my understanding, four years ago, 
the administration dictated to the Student 
Senate that minors would be removed from 
diplomas. Because of widespread student 
disappointment with this decision and 
movements to have it reversed, the enact
ment was held off for these past four years. 
Two weeks ago, John Papinchak spoke in 
front of the Student Senate and said, This 
is going to happen. Just wanted to make 
sure you knew. After a period of good discussion, I asked for an informal showing of 
hands to see how many of my peers in Senate 
did not want to see the policy passed, now 
that it had been explained. Nearly all those 
present at the meeting showed their objec
tion to the resolution. If this is the case across 
campus, which I feel it is, and if this was the 
case four years ago, why is it the adminis
trations conclusion that it should disregard 
student opinion and keep going along its 
unilateral path?
As a student body, we should have the 
right to a diploma in a shape that we would 
like to see it. As a student body, we also 
have the distinct right to make decisions 
that will ultimately affect us and not the 
administration.
My concern does not only regard the di
ploma issue. When the food trucks of Tech 
Street were relocated to Margaret Morrison, 
it was done in the shadows of the night for 
expressed reasons that were sketchy at 
best. When several fraternities were booted 
from their housing, there was no explana
tion. When are we going to begin holding 
the administration accountable to us? Its 
the only way we can make this school what 
we want it.
The Abercrombie & Fitch girl-cott has received a lot of press lately, which made us wonder:
Whats the best thing youve ever seen written on a T-shirt?

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 14, 2005
CMUs culture of competitive complaining belittles us all
Marshall Roy
Im told it happens at every 
top-tier school; my friend at 
Harvard calls it the suffering 
game. I call it I-got-less-sleepthan-you-did. Its a conversation 
weve all overheard (and maybe 
participated in once or twice): 
two students from different 
majors holding a spirited debate 
over whose life is more difficult. 
From outside, its laughable and 
pathetic, but from within, its 
life-or-death. Suddeiily someone 
has questioned your right to be 
.here, your right to respect your
self as an intellectual.
But if Albert Einstein, Gustave 
,rFlaubert, and Sir Laurence 
Olivier ever found themselves 
sitting around the same din
ner table, I think the last thing 
theyd do is get into a pissing 
contest.
Why do we do it? Why must 
we incessantly belittle one an
other in order to make ourselves 
feel more secure? Its as if we 
havent yet graduated from our 
high-school crises of validation. 
The difference is, now we ask 
How much sleep did you get 
last night? instead of How did 
you do on the test?
Apparently, any student who 
is able to find seven hours of 
sleep in his daily schedule isnt 
trying hard enough, or isnt 
mentally taxed enough by his 
course of study to warrant sleep 
deprivation.
As a society of young adults, 
were approaching a baffling 
reversal. Suddenly, good grades 
and mental health signify igno
rance (for only a feeble intel
lect would choose a course of 
study in which it could flourish), 
and those haggard, mentally 
exhausted, perennially cranky 
scholars we all know are the true 
prodigies among us (for theyre 
studying the really hard stuff). 
Thats ridiculous.
Of course we all deserve the 
occasional opportunity to vent 
our stress to our friends, but 
theres a difference between
simply blowing off steam and a 
litany of self-serving complaints 
that alienate our colleagues. 
Too often, we seek validation, 
not commiseration; the subtext 
of Im just so tired! is usually 
Look how much harder I work 
than you.
Even when were not directly 
challenged, were awfully indus
trious when it comes to bringing 
down those around us  how 
many times have you heard the 
cheap rhyme H & Less Stress, 
or that CFA stands for Cant 
Fucking Add, or that you cant 
take a dozen steps in Purnell 
without bumping into a threedigit SAT score, or that Tepper 
students are illiterate, or that 
computer science majors are al
lergic to sunlight and soap?
Enough already.
Accuse me of tooting CMUs 
horn all you want, but I tend 
to think that our university is a 
little city of geniuses  thats 
the reason I came here, honestly. 
No other school demonstrated 
to me such reverence for all the 
different forms of intelligence. 
It would be truly spectacular if 
we could take a tiny hint from 
our alma mater and start re
specting one another for our 
diverse studies. Truly, there is 
no easy major at CMU, and if 
you look very closely, our intel
lectual vocations are not all that 
different across academic bor
ders. On the surface, computer 
programming looks a whole 
lot different from Shakespeare, 
but arent they both just elegant 
lines of code?
Therein lies the key to a 
greater sense of harmony among 
students of different intellectual 
inclinations: finding common 
ground. Engineers should go 
to student art galleries; artists 
should attend science lectures. 
We can individually distinguish 
ourselves to no end, but we will 
(thankfully) never escape the 
scholarly heritage we all share. 
We should endeavor to make 
our minds like a good computer 
password: unassailable through 
diversity.
I like to describe Carnegie 
Mellon as a university with a 
multiple personality disorder.
Where else do future captains 
of industry rub elbows with 
techno-wizards and Broadways 
up-and-coming A-list? Whose 
English department offered the 
nations first undergraduate 
degree in creative writing and, 
along with Yale, helped pioneer 
the American birth of literary 
and cultural studies? Ours.
Isnt being worthy among 
brilliance the most legitimate 
validation?
Alma mater translates to 
nourishing mother. I think
thats appropriate. For its only 
natural for siblings to quibble 
with one another from time to 
time  but lets not forget that 
families are forged and fed by 
unconditional love. Im not sug
gesting that we all hold hands 
and have a singalong, just that 
we let go of our self-important 
prejudices and respect our col
leagues, our intellectual sib
lings, for all their talent and 
hard work. Pushing others down 
is no way to raise yourself up. 
(Actually, by Newtons Third
Law of Motion, it is. But Im an 
English major. You cant expect 
me to know that.)
Marshall Roy (mroy@J is a soph
omore in English and creative 
writing. He can barely do calculus 
in one dimension, let alone three. 
If his computer stops working 
and the battery isnt dead, hes 
stumped. He thinks the business 
cycle is a setting on the washing 
machine. But he can compose one 
helluva zeugma. He welcomes all 
thoughtful responses.

lack of experience against the pass 
was especially evident in the red 
zone, and Thiel scored six of their 
seven touchdowns via the pass.
The Tartan offense, though, was 
unusually potent, and managed 
to match the Tomcats significant 
production. The Tartans kept 
several drives alive with long third 
down throws, and also managed 
to get it in the end zone in the 
air, finishing with four receiving 
touchdowns. In addition, Sivek 
also ran the ball in for three touch
downs to make up for his belowaverage rushing total.
This success came despite los
ing starting quarterback Jarrod 
Highberger in the third quarter 
to injury. Highberger was re
placed by junior Kevin Mulkern 
who proved to be just as effective, 
completing seven of 11 passes for 
82 yards and two touchdowns.
Although the loss was dis
heartening, it did not sour the 
season for head coach Richard 
Lackner, who managed to secure 
the schools 31st consecutive non
losing season with a young and 
inexperienced group.
Its a sad day because this is the 
last time a lot of these guys will

Lackner. But its also very gratify

Even with the jump in compe

The mens lacrosse team is 
moving up. Last week the team

premier club lacrosse league 
in the country. The promotion 
coincides with the hiring of new 
head coach Anthony Stamtopoulos, and signals a new era of 
competitiveness for lacrosse at 
CMU.
CMU earned the promotion 
by virtue of its dominance of its

only lost a handful of matches.

Sophomore kicker Sammy Koyl 
has literally been the weak leg of 
the Thiel College football team all 
season. Coming into Saturdays 
game, Koyl only converted three 
of seven field goal attempts. Yet, 
for most of the season, the unde
feated Tomcats have not needed to 
rely on their kicker to win games. 
Saturdays game against Carne
gie Mellon in the Tartans home 
finale was almost an exception.
With less than a minute left 
on the play clock and the score
tied at 28, Thiel drove the length 
of the field to the CMU 15, set
ting up a 32-yard field goal at
tempt. After the Tartans burned 
three successive timeouts, Koyl, 
who had already missed two field 
goals, had a chance to end it; he 
missed inches left.
The Tomcats eventually pulled 
away in triple overtime, winning 
50-48 on a diving catch by Bran
don Chambers. The score, which 
came on a two-point conversion 
with the score tied, followed a 
failed conversion by the Tartans. 
On the Tartans attempt, wide 
receiver Jon Kline caught a short 
pass across the middle and was
dragged down just before the 
goal line. Thiels winning catch, 
on the other hand, appeared to 
hit the ground before being gath
ered in, but was ruled a score 
nonetheless.
I thought from my angle we 
got across the line, said standout 
running back Travis Sivek. That 
catch was definitely close too, but 
they were both tough calls.
The Tartans opened the game 
by jumping on Thiel (10-0), 
pounding the ball to a 21-14 
lead. They continued to rush the 
ball effectively throughout the 
entire game and finished with 
148 net yards on the ground.
When Thiel began to crowd the 
line, the Tartan quarterbacking 
tandem of Kevin Mulkern and 
Jarrod Highberger blitzed them 
deep; the pair finished with 191 
total passing yards.
They were small on defense, 
said Sivek, who rushed for 81 
yards. We thought we could run 
on them, especially since their 
corners were small, and then that 
let us start to throw it a little more 
for some balance.
Still, it took until late in the first 
quarter for the Tartans offense to 
get on track. Senior quarterback

Sports Editor
There are few schools like 
Carnegie Mellon when you find 
more people in computer clus
ters than the football stadium on 
Saturday afternoons. And while 
that may get the academic heads 
smiling, it reflects the general 
apathy with which the school 
views its sports. It has denied 
students their athletics, and ath
letes their fans.
To counteract the often 
neglected state of CMU sports, 
new athletic director Susan 
Bassett organized the schools 
first ever Student-Athlete Advi
sory Council. Bassett designed 
the SAAC which meets every 
two weeks and is comprised of 
two members from each varsity 
team to improve the general 
state of varsity athletics. One 
area of particular emphasis was 
raising the awareness and atten
dance at varsity events.
Our priority this year is to 
raise awareness on campus 
about our intercollegiate pro
grams and to provide spirit and 
support for our teams as they 
compete, said Bassett.
Were not trying to get the 
whole student body out to our 
games, added SAAC president 
David Krzeminski. But at least 
we need some improvement and 
this is a good way to start.
The SAAC has already consid
ered several ways to raise the 
profile of the schools athletics. 
One idea suggested at a recent 
meeting was a Carnival-type 
event with basketball shooting 
contests, T-shirt giveaways, and 
food. Other ideas have included 
offering pre-game tailgating 
parties similar to the one held
before Saturdays packed foot
ball game against Thiel, tabling 
and posting fliers to advertise 
important games.
Another function of the SAAC 
is to build inter-team relation
ships and to create a more welldefined athletic community. 
As Aanand Radia, a golfer and 
member of the SAAC, said, One 
of the biggest problems with our 
system is the disjoint between 
teams. This will build some ca
maraderie and help to get [all of 
the athletes] to the other teams 
matches.
There are already plans for 
an athletes ball to be held offcampus at some point in the sec
ond semester. Also in the works

Finally, to build support between

arranged that will pair differ

It gives us [athletes at CMU] 
a voice for any issues, problems

and get things done.
A big reason the forum is 
so successful in this regard is 
because it does indeed make

bound past Fredonia goalie Matt

goal off a throw-in from first-year 
Daniel Brackley.
Thats just the way this team 
is, said Filipovitz. Were not 
going to give up. The seniors were 
out there pumping everyone up, 
letting them know we still had a 
chance. Then when Jon punched 
in the PK, we knew we were still 
in it. Thought we had it.
Carnegie Mellon got off to a 
quick start in the game. Just 25 
minutes in Jonathan Browne was 
taken down in the box chasing a 
cross from Andrew Park. He net
ted the subsequent penalty kick 
to give CMU a 1-0 lead.
Soon, though, things spiraled
out of control for the Tartans. 
Just five minutes before the end 
of the half Fredonia was awarded 
a penalty kick after Vincenzo Alfiero was tripped on a breakaway. 
CMU goalie Mathew Bazin saved 
the ensuing penalty kick and then 
dove to knock away Alfieros one
time follow, and Matt Wilkinson 
cleared the ball out of danger. 
Three minutes later, though, 
Fredonia scored when Nathan 
Gross sent a ball across the box; 
Michael Battisti pocketed it just 
inside the near post.
In the second half, Fredonia 
immediately jumped on the at
tack. Jason Juskiewicz scored on 
a shot from 20 yards out. Twenty 
minutes later Moretti headed in 
his goal to give Fredonia their 
stranglehold on the game.
nias Brandon Derkacz ended 
the sudden-death period with a 
point-blank blast that came off 
a loose ball inside the box. The 
goal ended the Tartans impres
sive season, which saw the team 
replace four key starters and still 
climb as high as number 19 na
tionally, winning 13 games.
Its still a good season for 
us, said sophomore midfielder 
Sean Filipovitz. Getting to [the] 
NCAAs again was a big accom
plishment; thats what we were 
going for at the beginning of the 
year. Everyone hoped for more, 
and it was unlucky, but it hap

When Fredonia States Jeff

goal with just 25 minutes to play 
in Saturday nights NCAA firstround game, one could almost 
hear the commentators talking 
about the proverbial nail going 
into the coffin. But with their sea

including a desperate header 
by midfielder William Schlough 
with less than three minutes left

Mens XC finishes second at regionals
by Jordan Koslosky
Junior Staffwriter
As seniors Nick End and Dana 
Irrer broke away from the giant 
field at the start of the Mideast 
Regional race at Dickinson Col
lege, they were not only inspired 
by the possibility of it being their 
last race, but also by the per
ceived lack of respect their team 
has encountered during the year. 
No one in the region gave us 
any respect throughout the en
tire season, said End.
If they had not impressed 
their critics yet, Saturdays 
second-place finish was cer
tainly a good start. The CMU 
men secured a place in the 
NCAA national team championsips by beating such national 
powers as Widener University 
and Allegheny College just a 
week after taking the UAA cham
pionship. Only Haverford, the 
eventual champions and the na
tions eighth-ranked team, outraced the Tartans.
End and Irrer led the Tartans, 
finishing fourth and fifth respec
tively. Both started strong, break
ing away from the pack at the 
mile mark with a group of 10 to 
15 runners. After 2.5 miles, the 
pack dwindled to six, at which 
point the eventual winner, Yuot
Macharia of Widener, broke free.
End and Irrer were still in the 
hunt for second place all the 
way up to the races final hill. 
Accompanied by two rival run
ners from Haverford at the fourmile mark, though, the Carnegie 
Mellon pair ran out of gas and 
lost any chance of overtaking 
them.
We were both dying going 
up the last hill, said End. It 
was a very tough last stretch to 
go through after that pace of a 
race.
In addition to End and Irrer, 
first-year Breck Fresen excelled 
in his first Mideast Regional race, 
placing 16th and gaining crucial 
points for the mens team. End 
praised Fresen: He had a really 
great race; no one expected it. 
Junior Mike Bridenbaugh and 
first-year Brian Harvey, mean
while, finished 20th and 35th, 
respectively.
The team heads to nationals on 
November 19 at Ohio Wesleyan 
University, where they have an 
already stated goal of finishing 
in the top ten. Irrer and End 
also have high expectations. Says 
End, Dana and I are hoping to 
be as far up as we can, go up with 
the lead pack and fight our way 
to the finish, hoping to be AllAmerican.
Until nationals, though, there 
$
is time for the team to celebrate 
its upset finish as well as its new
found respect on the national 
level.
It is pretty sweet, because no 
one thought we would qualify 
[for nationals], said End. But 
we destroyed all the competi
tion.
On the womens side, senior 
standout Jocelyn Sikora led the 
team to an impressive tenth-place 
finish at the Mideast Regionals. It 
was a sentimental race for the 
Tartans, who graduate four other 
seniors along with Sikora, all of 
whom have been key contribu
tors since their freshman years.
It was a good race that started 
off well, said Sikora. There was 
a big pack, so it was easy to stay 
with people.
In her last race as a Tartan, 
Sikora placed 18th, narrowly 
missing a spot in the NCAA in
dividual championships. She set 
a new personal record with the 
time of 23:18.9, capping off a tre
mendous career as one of the top 
female runners in school history.
The Tartans competed against 
42 other teams, consisting of 293 
total runners. The tenth-place 
finish served as a big improve
ment from last year, when the 
team finished in 22nd place at 
the Regionals and was mostly a 
competitive afterthought.

Enon rocks Drill Deck
Unique fusion of indie rock and pop attracts big crowd
Enon  composed of singer-guitarist-bassist John Schmersal, singer-keyboardist-bassist Rick Lee, and drummer Steve Calhoon  were not easy to bring to CMU. It took months of contract planning and negotiations, but after all was said and done, Enon brought the dingy-as-hell house down.
As hipsters, preppies, and sto'ners filed into the dingy student center to see indie rockers Enon, it i/vas quite impressive to see the eclectic crowd the band drew. Enons music embodied their diverse fan base.
Compared to the sound of hundreds of bands, from the Postal Service to the Pixies, Enons fusion of indie rock and synth-pop is both intelligent and impatient; a three-minute song is a long one, but has enough complexity and variation to last much longer. Their style comes from a je-ne-sais-quelle breed of synthesized melodies, catchy guitar licks, and a rhythm section that will undoubtedly wake up the neighbors. Although lacking the raw vocal or instrumental technique of groups like the Postal Service, the music hits harder; youre not likely to hum a cool Enon tune youve just heard on the way out, but youre much more likely to be taken aback and sucked into their music. They are, in that manner, more dramatic than their peers.
On Saturday night, the group pounded their way through punk-rock anthems like Snaggletooth, a balls-to-the-wall frenzy of punchy bass riffs and wall-shaking drum ' beats, while also rocking the dance-inducing Natural Disasters, a bouncy melodic rock tune, a tune Kurt Cobain could have written if he were ever in a good mood. Lee passed her bass off to Schmersal for the techno-rock of Disposable Parts so she could sing and play synthesizer. The tunes melodic bass line, catchy refrain, and arse-kicking drum beat brought out the Kraftwerk synth-pop also common in bands like The Killers and Interpol.
As I took note of the poor acoustics in the Drill Deck, I noticed Enons music and appearance seemed to fit pretty well with the rooms peeling paint and cracking wood. The amps crackled between songs. The instruments were chipped and dented. Lee sported a
tattered black dress and Schmersal a wornthrough vintage yellow and pink sweater. All the while, the music was raw and piercing as it climbed to peaks and barreled through lows.
Enon came to CMU to rock, and rock they did. The drill decks crowd giggled at the bands jokes between songs and danced during them. The group left a great impression on newbies, and smiles on the faces of long-time fans. They made you feel good and were fun to dance to, Derek Eguae-Obazee, a junior chemical engineering major, said of Enon. It was a good show. With a newly released Bsides compilation, Lost Marbles and Exploded Evidence, Enon are showing little sign of slowing down, giving Pittsburgh fans hope that these great guys (and girl) will be back on campus soon.

English Patient author speaks on his life and doubts
Michael Ondaatje reveals the places and people which have influenced him
Checklist for achieving the Writers Look: Beard? Check. Glasses? Check. Graying hair? Check. Deep, warm voice? Check. Omnipresent scarf? Check. Michael Ondaatje has all those characteristics. But he has a few marks on his resume other writers dont. For one thing, hes written in the genres of poetry, fiction, and memoir. For another, a film based on his novel The English Patient won no fewer than nine Oscars.
Michael Ondaatje has lived in Sri Lanka, England, and Canada, but was born to Indian and Dutch parents. He started his reading at the University of Pittsburghs campus by saying that when he started his first book of prose, he felt like I was either going mad or I was on to something.
Obviously, he was on to something.
When Ondaatje sits down to write now, he has to worry about his sanity. At his reading last Thursday he drew a standing-room only crowd, and its no surprise. After
all, Ondaatje is responsible for writing the novel that became an Oscar-sweeping film. Ondaatjes story-telling capabilities drew crowds to the film and praise from the critics.
Ondaatje read from both of his poetry collections, including Handwriting, which he wrote in his native Sri Lanka. His readings of poetry are more suited to his musical style and rhythmic voice than prose readings. He read the title poem from his collection The Cinnamon Peeler  a beautiful piece that uses the sense of smell as few poems do. Throughout The Cinnamon Peeler the sense of belonging to a lover is conveyed through scent.
Between each break Ondaatje cracked little jokes. His autobiography Running in the Family, he suggested, would be better titled Running Away from the Family. The works about family are the most engaging: his 
Courtesy of www.alyon.com grandmother truly came to life as
he described her stealing peoples prize roses from their gardens and dressing his mother up as a lobster so that she could win the prize in a costume party.
Finally Ondaatje read from both The English Patient and his newest book, AniVs Ghost. All his stories are full of rich sensory details. Ondaatje uses meaningful metaphor with grace, likening the beating heart of the title character to a clock on a mine.
During audience questions Ondaatje addressed every topic from whether he still looks at the stars to his feelings on the editing process. He described his influences as a mix of poets and novelists; the list includes Robert Creeley and William Maxwell.
Ondaatje may be critically acclaimed, but the way he plans a story may give hope to all the would-be writers out there that feel they can never come up with the ideas that some authors have. A lot of writers know what the last sentence [of their novel] is going to be, Ondaatje said, I dont know what the second sentence is going to be. It keeps me tense, [it] helps me to write.

Talking sex with Sue Johanson
Words of wisdom from the Oxygen network's Sunday Night Sex Show
Picture this: youre doing homework with the TV on in the background, and all of a sudden you hear, Are your genitals sniffy pure? Youre sitting there pondering what the hell you just heard. You turn to the television set, and theres an old lady sitting behind a counter, talking. You think, That old lady did not just say that. Oh, but she did.
What you just witnessed was Sue Johanson, Canadas leading sexual educator, doing her Sunday Night Sex Show on Oxygen. If you bothered to pay attention to more, you got past the feeling of intense confusion and moved on to thinking that the whole scene playing in front of your eyes was utterly hilarious. And then you would get addicted to the show.
But Johansons show isnt meant to be a farce. F^n, yes, but Johanson is seriously concerned about educating people about sex. Her show is meant to be a straightforward, informative, and educational sex talk show. She reviews sex-related products (toys, porn, books, and more), talks about sex and raising awareness about safe sex
practices, and answers sex-related questions from callers. To celebrate their 75th anniversary, Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania invited Johanson to speak a bit about the importance of good sexual education in schools. Friday night, I was lucky enough to get to see her do a little bit of everything at Carnegie Music Hall.
Johanson waltzed onstage with a little jump in her step. I feel like I should do some sort of strip, she said, as she grabbed her breasts. Then, stroking the microphone slowly from top to bottom, They never give me this kind of microphone... Yeah, this was definitely going to be an entertaining night. Johanson talked for a bit about what brought her to where she was today, which included five pregnancies, three kids at ten months apart each, and training at a Catholic nursing facility, where they taught her that she should cut holes in condoms, to give sperm a fighting chance at life.
I soon realized kids were having more sex than I was. And I was pissed. But she also realized that few knew how to have safe sex, or even really knew the logistics of sex and
the reproductive system. Johanson pointed out that girls especially have a lack of knowledge about their sexuality until their late teens, because theres so little focus on it in school. Johanson said, We dont have a language for our genitals. We have down there. Guys have pages of words for their genitals. Girls have down there.
And that, she said, is why Planned Parenthood was so important to her. Not only has it worked hard to spread awareness of smart sexual practices to men and women all over the country, it has made Johanson what she is today. Johanson said, You have Planned Parenthood to thank for Sue Johanson coming to terms with her sexuality. Planned Parenthood taught her things she needed to know about sex and continues to push for better sexual education programs in schools throughout the country. This [lack of good sex ed in America] scares me. We are going backwards. We are not going forwards.

The Rocket Summer sizzles
A band with talent and carefully crafted lyrics
With file sharing programs like Kazaa and i2hub, why should anyone go out and physically purchase a CD that will just end up collecting dust in a box with all the other albums in the attic? The answer: because some CDs are actually worth the $12 you pay for them.
Once in a while, if you get lucky, you come across an amazing band like The Rocket Summer, an uplifting and talented pop rock band. Unlike most music that people gradually forget over time, The Rocket Summer is more than just a bunch of superficial tunes and lyrics thrown together to appeal to the typical 16-to-25-year-old audience. Their newest album, Hello, Good Friend, consists of music that is honest, nostalgic, and refreshing. Whether you are a fan of good lyrics or great instrumentals, The Rocket Summer offers both. With heavy use of piano mixed with candid lyrics, Hello, Good Friend breaks out of the typical pop:rock mold.
Although the album starts off a bit slow in its first two songs, its not indicative of what the rest of the album has to offer. Just when you expect the remaining music to be a complete letdown, The Rocket Summer amazes with its sincere and down-to-earth music.
Lets admit it, were tired of listening to any kind of song with the word love in it. So why is The Rocket Summers newest album any different? Because each song in Hello, Good Friend shares a storyline that everyone can relate to. These stories are interwoven in a way that doesnt
just tell a story, but captures a feeling of familiarity. Who doesnt recall those post-high-school years when we went back home and stayed up all night with our hometown buddies, talking about all those adventures from the past? Or what about the talks on the phone with your best friend that lasted well into the early morning, wondering what the future held? The reason why the lyrics on Hello, Good Friend are so appealing during this particular stage in our lives might be because the entire album marks a rite of passage. To be honest, the transition from a teenager into adulthood is intimidating, if not downright terrifying. The honesty and sincerity of The Rocket Summers songs are encouraging, like the feeling you get after being reunited with a long-lost friend from the past.
Another plus factor of Hello, Good Friend is its discordant lyrics. Now you may be skeptical and ask why discordant lyrics are a good thing. The fact is that some bands produce such discordant sounds that it makes you want to run into their recording studio, tear up everything in sight, puke all over the floors, and then set the building on fire.
But sometimes, in rare cases, discord can be beautiful. Although The Rocket Summers words seem to be thrown together haphazardly, like a stream of unconscious thoughts, it is precisely this characteristic that makes them powerful. These arent the cliched phrases or superficial words that re-emerge in pop music over and
over again. They arent staged, and they dont necessarily rhyme. But they do flow. These are natural thoughts, not specific words that some songwriters artificially string together to induce a certain emotion in the audience.
Unlike the same old melodies you hear in music from groups like Simple Plan, Blink-182, and the Ataris, Hello, Good Friend has music that is both beautiful and energetic. The heavy use of piano adds dynamism to The Rocket Summers songs, which makes them hit home even harder. Giving the songs a simple yet elegant sound, the piano makes the music soothing, yet powerful and uplifting at the same time.
If you want to hear drum solos, this is definitely not the album for you. Most importantly, there are neither longhaired men dressed up in metallic jumpsuits (a good thing), nor drugs, alcohol, or sex involved. What the album can guarantee is good clean fun and a new list of sing-along songs. For a small monetary sum, the album can create feelings of intense euphoria, even if it is 11 degrees outside and it seems like all cheerfulness has been sucked out of Pittsburgh. Getting a warm fuzzy feeling while its freezing cold, gloomy, windy, and possibly raining outside: priceless.

Local arts center showcases aspects of American life
Manchester Craftsmens Guild brings contemporary artists works to Pittsburgh
Two young bullriders give tough-guy looks to the camera, next to an elderly woman who stares despondently into the waters of her bath. Around the corner, two circus clowns hide behind their masks in a corner of an outdoor trailer, and couples dance in a Mississippi night club.
These sights of everyday America from the past four decades, recalling everything from the turmoil of the Vietnam War to the thrills of the big top, are on display at the Manchester Craftsmens Guild for the next two months, as the organization presents the work of a pair of contemporary photographers.
The show brings together 33 selected works from American Odyssey, a 1999 book by Mary Ellen Mark, and 20 photographs in the Circus series by Norma I. Quintana. Both exhibits opened on October 21 at the MCGs Galleries on the North Side.
Mark, a contributing photographer at The New Yorker, has won international accolades for her photo essays, ranging from shots of Mother Teresa in India to a series on runaway children in Seattle. She has published 15 books, and her work has also appeared in the pages of Life, Vanity Fair, and Rolling Stone.
Her works on display at MCG date from between 1963 and 1999. They are selected from the much larger body of work that appeared in American Odyssey, but still provide a representative sample, said Angeliki Georgiou, MCGs coordinator of visiting artists and exhibitions.
I feel that we have a good selection of the different groups she followed through the years, Georgiou said.
From the extremely poor to the very rich, I have been a witness to some of the things that make this country so extraordinary, Mark stated. I have photographed people at baby beauty pageants and in singles bars, at twins conventions and Ku Klux Klan gatherings.
A striking characteristic of many of Marks photos at MCG is the intense relationship she creates between subject and viewer. The subjects of these photographs stare intently into the camera lens, variously evoking aloofness, sullenness, or an odd sense of detachment from their surroundings.
In one exposure, for example, a large woman in dark formal wear gives an arch look over her shoulder as a lapdog licks her face.
The images present a side of the U.S. different from the glamorous one seen elsewhere, Georgiou said, noting that Mark calls herself a street photographer. But the presentation features the countrys lighter side as well, with shots of bodybuilders, children playing in Central Park, and spring break crowds from Daytona Beach. My travels through America have defined my vision as a photographer, said Mark.
MCGs second exhibit features West Coast photographer Norma I. Quintana. She studied for a time under Mark during a series of workshops in Mexico, and Georgiou said she chose to pair Quintanas work with Marks in order to highlight this mentee-mentor relationship.
Quintana produced her Circus series over the past eight years, recording the off-stage life of Circus Chimera, a Mexican one-ring traveling group. Her photographs, all taken without artificial lighting, have mainly been exhibited in California, but the installment at MCG is half of a traveling exhibit that was previously at Penn State University.
The 20 photographs, arranged around the perimeter of a larger hall, create a gentler initial impression than Marks works, which are grouped more tightly in a smaller room. Supplementing this freedom of space is a certain freedom of expression in the photographed subjects: a close-up of one circus performer displays a secretive smile, something that might seem out of place in Marks more dramatic shots.
Though the faces of the subjects are less startling and more relaxed in many cases, Quintanas refusal to shoot with artificial light provides an interesting study of color tones elsewhere in the photograph. Outdoor exposures, with full natural light, tend toward well-balanced moderate gray tones; photos taken indoors or at night exhibit a stark contrast between bright whites and deep blacks that enhance the overall depth of the scene.
Both Mark and Quintana visited MCG last month to give public lectures and conduct workshops with students in the guilds after-school program. As a non-profit arts organization, MCG offers programs in photography, ceramics, and sculpture to students from Pittsburgh public high schools; the center also employs an artist in residence for in-school visits. During her visit in October, Quintana helped students take photos at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus, and Georgiou said the students are now working on producing their own exhibition with the results.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang hits the mark
A perfect blend of comedy and romance, this film is worth seeing

Robert Downey, Jr., plays a downtrodden thief turned actor who still cannot get over his high school love.
demands to get in on the case and begins to help Gay Perry and Locke with the investigation. Never a damsel in distress, Harmony is quick on her feet and even faster to realize the truth behind the murders.
Through a series of ever-worsening twists and turns, Locke finds himself having acquired a nasty bullet wound and a scarred face, losing his ring finger and his dignity. Perry, ever the resourceful sidekick, continually manages to weasel them out of trouble.
Gay Perry does not so much as shudder at the sight of mutilated corpses, nor react to desperate Los Angeles actresses wearing nothing more than strategically placed strings, or sometimes nothing at all. Though Perrys not startled by boobs and brutality, you might be. This movie does have quite a bit of nudity and gruesome scenes that might be too much for more sensitive audience members to handle. (I had my hand over my eyes for well over half the film, but then again, I had nightmares from the original I Know What You Did Last Summer).
However, the sarcastic writing of the film keeps audiences laughing at its movie cliches. Lockes narration of the film also helps clear up the somewhat confusing plot and allows the audience to understand the characters in an intimate and hilarious way.
As the title suggests, the film is half romantic comedy, half murder-mystery thriller, but it always manages to be witty and sarcastic. In addition to narrating, Locke freezes frames, curses himself for his terrible narration, and pokes fun at the far-fetched plot. As the story begins to unwind, Locke tells the audience: Dont worry, I saw Lord of the Rings. Im not going to end this 17 times.
And after an hour and 40 minutes of strong profanity and a complete absence of political correctness, Locke and Gay Perry apologize to all those in the audience whom they might have offended.
Although Locke may find his situation to be every shade of wrong, audiences will love every moment of this black comedy with an attitude. Not for the easily offended, the movie takes a lighthearted stab at combining sex, murder, and mystery into an enjoyable two-hour adventure.

This is every shade of wrong, Harry Locke exclaims as he finds himself getting deeper and deeper into a series of loosely connected murders in Los Angeles. Locke is played by Robert Downey, Jr., who gives a stellar performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang as the New York City thug who avoids prosecution by pretending to be an actor in the oh-so-shallow Los Angeles film community. The film follows Locke as he and a Hollywood heavyweight, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), begin investigating the suspicious murder of a local heiress whose corpse they stumble upon while training Locke for his role as a detective.
Locke, a kleptomaniac, is a dumb criminal. Not streetsmart in any sense of the word, he picks fights with all the wrong guys. In a moment of extreme stupidity, he shouts at the killers when he and Gay Perry happen upon them dumping the heiress body into the lake. That gets him onto the killers hit list, and soon after, the killers take the body and deposit it in his shower, instead.
Frightened to death, Locke urinates on the body before
he hides under his own bathroom counter and curls up, eyes wide with shock. Shaking uncontrollably, Locke desperately calls Gay Perry, who earlier had curtly told Locke to hesitate to call.
Perry, a clever guy who manages to always stay one step ahead of everyone else, helps Locke deposit the body, now completely mutilated. Without so much as scratching his beautiful Mercedes Benz, Gay Perry shoves the body in the trunk of his car, drives to an isolated part of town, and he and Locke dump the body on a street sidewalk before speeding off.
The plot thickens as Locke realizes that his long-lost love, Harmony, is connected with the murder and may also be in jeopardy. Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) is a Hollywood hopeful approaching middle age with only a beer commercial to her credit. Coming from an abusive family in the Midwest, Harmony brings her own baggage to the plot when her long-lost sister turns up dead. In denial that her sister could have taken her own life, Harmony

Robinson to breathe new life into CFA
New dean has big plans to keep up the art schools reputation
Courtesy of The Thistle
Henry Hombostel was the first dean of the school of Applied Design 
(changed to College of Fine Arts in 1920). A world-renowned 
architect, he designed the initial layout of the Carnegie technical 
schools, as well as Webster Hall and the Rodef Shalom temple.
Thinking through doing: Its the latest ideology of Carnegie Mellons College of Fine Arts, according to the Colleges new dean, Hilary Robinson. This innovative approach to understanding the arts is what is going to bring the College into its second century, as this year CFA celebrates a century of education.
Carnegie Mellons renowned art programs have long been recognized for preparing students to be active artists in their society. And Dean Robinson, new to CMU this fall, wants to augment the Colleges reputation with her new approach to making CFA an integral part of Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
Past deans of the College have emphasized students pioneering work, encouraging them to espouse a pluralism that respects origins and encourages innovation, according to the College of Fine Arts website. With such a solid foundation in providing a challenging educational environment, Dean Robinson is aware that she has a lot of pressure to continue this legacy.
Robinsons Resume
Hilary Robinson began training as a professional painter in England in the 1970s. She worked simultaneously as an artist and as a freelance arts administrator, critic, and lecturer. At the same time, she did research and development work for an Art in Public Places agency.
After acquiring her BA in the 1980s from the Royal College of Art, London, she received the Allan Lane Award for Outstanding Contribution to Cultural Theory, thus establishing her credentials in that field.
She went on to earn her PhD at the University of Leeds, and studied the applicability to art practices of the work of French philosopher Luce Irigaray.
In 1992 Robinson joined the faculty of the University of Ulster with a brief to integrate that activity with the Studio program at the BA and MFA level [s]. She surpassed this when she led the school to earn the joint highest rating out of the 75 art and design institutions in the United Kingdom, and she was soon appointed to become head of the school. While head of the university she created many programs and coordinated a successful bid for nine million pounds [about $15 million] for a research centre for the school.
In addition to her accomplishments at the University of
Ulster, Robinson conducted notable research in contemporary art theory. She has published Visible Female (1987) and Feminism Art Theory 1968-2000 (2001). Her latest monograph, Reading Art, Reading Irigaray: The Politics of Art by Women, will be published this year.
Moreover, when Robinson isnt authoring works, she has an impressive tenure at conferences. She has refereed conference papers and convened panels, such as the College Art Association, the American Society for Aesthetics, and the Association of Art Historians.
In addition to her work as a writer, she has found the time to become a member of several distinguished committees in the United Kingdom, including the Executive Committee for the Council for Higher Education in Art and Design, the Management Advisory Board for the Art Design Media Higher Education Academy. She is also the chair of the board of the Ormeau Baths Gallery, the leading contemporary art gallery in Northern Ireland.
Peer Review
Hilary Robinson, says CMU provost Mark Kamlet, is very passionate about the role of the arts in society. Parts of CFA have always had a conservatory feel; Robinson stresses that students learn the most from a more interdisciplinary approach. CFA is quite close to all colleges at CMU  including the Tepper School of Business, Humanities and Social Sciences, and the Carnegie Institute of Technology  and this proximity has its distinct advantages.
Within the college itself, Dean Robinson wants to make sure that the individual schools within CFA are united and are working together to create new forms of art for society. Giving the college a more coherent voice within the University and beyond is an idea that, Robinson explains, is built upon the work of past deans.
She emphasizes the fact that she does not plan to completely change CFA, but rather to help it evolve into a powerhouse of intellectual activity, research, and art production. Its an intellectual activity, she says. Artists are philosophers as much as poets.
This interdisciplinary approach isnt new, but its not necessarily emphasized within CFA consistently. Creating a curriculum that encourages working with colleges across the University to produce work could be a sizable change in how CFA does business.

---------------------------------------------------

Big Plans
The College of Fine Arts already has an outstanding reputation, which Robinson hopes to maintain and build upon. CFA is unique on a national level for advocating inquiry and being bold enough to question it. As she says, methods for research can happen in the studio, the library, the laboratory... Research is at the core of everything.
Another one of Robinsons plans is to focus on the futures of CFA graduates after graduation. CFA is responsible for equipping its students with all the tools necessary for their profession. More importantly, Robinson believes that students must be able to integrate these tools. Only then will they be able to reach their full potential and stand out not only from graduates from other universities, but from each other.
Artists are often attracted to raw industrial areas, like Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh. As the artist begins to settle in these areas, support from the community (cafes, shops, and galleries) comes in and creates a neighborhood. Robinson would like to encourage this development in Pittsburgh by making sure that the University 
is not isolated.
Ongoing projects such as the Urban-lab Project of the School of Architecture are a way to achieve this integration between the University and the community.
Robinson believes the best artwork is that which elevates the viewer. It contains an element that evokes emotion. This is because the best artwork is made with a purpose. She says that making art is not about being comfortable, its about challenging and daring to do things people dont like.
Artists are inventors who invent ways to perplex the human mind. They are always asking what if?, but unlike the conventional mind, they do not answer with either this or that. They believe that the answer may be both this and that. It is in this way that they are able to make a discovery and create a novelty. The trick, as human beings, is to keep that sense of discovery.
As CFA celebrates its one hundredth birthday, Robinson enters the limelight at a pivotal point in the Colleges history. She has the opportunity to not only reform its outreach to Carnegie Mellon as a whole, but also to underscore the importance of an esteemed center for arts research and advancement in society.
Courtesy of CFA Media Relations
Dean Hilary Robinson sits in front of her new workplace, the College of Fine Arts.
Dean Robinson maintains that this is a time to look forward: The worst thing an art school can do is become nostalgic, she explained. The College must push, initiate, drive forward into the future, making sure that artists are always people irritating each other. Only this will lead to students success, whether they be an engineers, poets, actors, or painters. Robinson, in her new role as dean, will be challenged to keep pushing the college into
its next hundred years and continue to build upon CFAs already impressive reputation.

Hungry for some wit? Try some Toothpaste for Dinner
A humorous collection of comics from the mind of Drew
Unemployment  ten million Americans cant be wrong! jokes one of the funniest comics on the Web to date.
Toothpaste for Dinner, written by Drew, no last name a bored chemist who also creates a series of comics reflecting the jaded attitude of American society  is based on his popular webcomic by the same name. Drew, who lives in Ohio with his wife, takes a cynical and sarcastic view on the mixing of chemicals that result in air fresheners, and not the saving of a life. Blatantly put, he wrote this book as a result of hiding in the back of his lab and not doing work, but argues that as long as you laugh, this book is worth your time. And his job.
Toothpaste for Dinner continues this year as what raving critics have called one of the most addicting comics on the Web. Published in an easy to read, easy to carry, and easy-to-laugh-with book, Toothpaste for Dinner is right on cue with the comic revolution of the early 1990s and the creation of Dilbert. Commenting on employment (or a lack thereof), the American Dream, having kids, and life in general, its humor is geared towards the new optimists of the jaded workplace, but not quite your mom or dad. Parents might get a kick out of Drews rule of grandparents: The meanest ones always live the longest, and his current research on finding television shows that not
only have a laugh track, but humor as well. But most of his humor is geared towards those of the younger generation.
While his newest compilation edges toward the young adults and 20-to-30-somethings in the world, it still reserves some young humor that older folk wont understand, including comic spiels on your baby daddy, piPods from the ancient Greek and Roman eras, Japanese anime, and Goths finally turning into bats, but sadly being murdered by a broom.
Divided into five sections, the book contains absurd titles such as Mousetraps and Ping Pong Balls, and No Birthday Cake for the Dog.
With various commentaries on why you shouldnt have kids (remember, they decide your nursing home), the workplace (It takes two weeks for every single job to turn to crap), and even the new, redefined American dream (Not only did I marry someone with health insurance, but thanks to the declining value of the dollar, Im paying less rent every day), Drew crosses those social lines your mom warned you not to talk about, without being too harsh. Reminiscent of those stick figures you drew in kindergarten, and probably still draw unless youre an art major, his childish stick-figure characters
balance the blunt humor with a sense of innocence. Eloquently, without stepping on toes, he allows us t( laugh at the truths of life, the bizarre vagaries of thi world, and, most importantly, ourselves.
Some of the commentaries are, however, complete! absurd, and will make you laugh out loud for no reasoi other than their sheer stupidity. Cartoons in this categor include hamsters trading cigarettes for favors and low carb birthday steaks. Clocking in at 223 pages, a completi table of contents and an index, Toothpaste for Dinner i sure to keep you busy for hours of enjoyable laughs witl your friends. So, if you havent read Toothpaste for Dinne yet, as Drew would say, Four out of five doctors agree Shut up, get a copy, and read this book.

A lot of girls embraced Johnny Depp 
as Hollywoods alternative hunk af
ter Pirates of the Caribbean, but I saw 
him firstin this movie, to be specific. 
There was a time when he was not just 
idiosyncratic and handsome but idio
syncratic and heartbreakingly beauti
ful, as in this first collaboration with 
Tim Burton. Depp plays Edward, a 
sensitive Frankensteins monster whos 
adopted into a suburban family and 
falls in love with their daughter (Wi
nona Ryder). Only this actor and direc
tor could make creepiness so charming 
and charm so creepy.
The Knack... and 
How to Get It

What is the Knack? I guess youll just 
have to see the film. A condensation of 
all things sixties, British, and mod, this 
movie does Austin Powers one better by 
actually being made in London in 1965. 
Nancy is a suburban girl who arrives 
in London looking for the YWCA and 
instead runs into a trio of roommates
 handsome swinger Tolen; shy, awk
ward Colin; and strange painter Tom 
in their quest to find Colin a bigger bed. 
Why does Colin need a bigger bed? Its 
so he can practice the... you know.
War of the Worlds

Steven Spielberg pulls out all the stops 
for this apocalyptic version of the 
famous H.G. Wells story. Tom Cruise is 
Ray Ferrier, a workman from Bayonne, 
New Jersey, whose neighborhood is 
obliterated by tentacled alien invaders 
during a weekend with his kids. 
Whether the plotline will keep you 
in thrall is debatable, but theres no 
question that Spielberg is a master of 
visuals. Try not to be struck by the irony 
that Cruise is running away from the 
aliens, when in reality some versions 
of his religion would dictate ihat he is 
one.
The Dukes of 
Hazzard
Saturday, November 19 
@8,10,12
For those of the under-45 set, The Dukes 
of Hazzard was originally a cheesy 1970s 
TV series about southern slackers who 
evaded police in their vivid orange and 
politically incorrect Dodge Charger, the 
General Lee. The fact that this movie 
exists should be proof enough that 
Hollywood has run out of ideas; still, 
for all its faults, its kind of fun. Johnny 
Knoxville and Seann William Scott 
play Luke and Bo Duke, two affable 
screwups out to save the family farm 
and outrun Burt Reynolds, and Jessica 
Simpson bounces around gratuitously 
as their cousin Daisy.

HOROSCOPES.
BY MARSHALL ROY
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): This week, you will renounce your material 
possessions and join a monastery. Unfortunately, youll be less of the typical pietyand-good-works monk and more of the Gregory Lewis variety  fornicating with 
your sister in a crypt and whatnot. What are the odds?
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): As Mercury displaces Saturn as reigning celestial 
mayor and Neptune moves into Jupiter, look out for my foot heading swiftly for 
Uranus.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Your Anchorman quote-off will go horribly wrong 
when one of your friends actually punts a puppy off the Birmingham Bridge. Way 
to keep it classy, Pittsburgh.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Sometime in the near future, Clear Channel will 
actually purchase the rights to your imagination, which means youd better nix 
those dirty little fantasies of Professor Studly, and try to repress the memory of 
that time you fornicated with your sister in a crypt, because that shit aint family 
friendly.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): This week, readme will publish its 500th article 
making fun of CMU students for being sexually inactive. To celebrate, the entire 
staff will sit in a circle and recite Mitch Hedberg lines.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): This weekend, youll partake in a game of 
Chinese Roulette  which is just like Russian Roulette, except instead of a gun, 
its a plate of shrimp fried rice of dubious age, and instead of a bullet, its salmo
nella. Wash it all down with a tall glass of sake for a pan-Asian gastrointestinal 
extravaganza!
LIBRA (September 23'- October 22): Remember, gentlemen, the absence of 
no does not mean yes unless the question, witnessed and verified by a notary 
public, is do you by your absence of no concede that the absence of no does in 
fact signify yes and thereby render in the affirmative your current response?"
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): What happened in Vegas wifi stay in 
Vegas so long as your next employer doesnt do too thorough a background check. 
If he or she does, then what happened in Vegas will leap right out of Vegas and 
all over the sales floor of Banana Republic. (P.S.: Way to put your H&SS degree 
to good use, chump).
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): This holiday season, Im thankful 
for pre-colonial ethnic cleansing and revisionist history. Who wants to say grace?
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): I know all this crisp air and sunshine 
has been getting you down lately, but dont worry. Pretty soon itll be winter, and 
Pittsburghs Gods of Grayness will come to claim your soul and drag it down to 
a gray hell.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Heres the thing: belting out Carole King 
in the shower isnt that emasculating. Its even okay that you do it in your shrillest 
falsetto. Whats got the rumor mill churning is your insistence on wrapping your 
towel high up around your chest, instead of around your waist, like dudes do it.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You know that really symbolic opening scene 
of The Grapes of Wrath where the turtle is struggling to cross the road? Your week 
will be a lot like that (i.e., you'll be hit by a truck).
