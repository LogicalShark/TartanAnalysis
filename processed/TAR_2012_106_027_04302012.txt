With the ongoing bomb 
threats at the University of 
Pittsburgh and recent shooting at Western Psychiatric 
Hospital, safety has become 
a top priority for many members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
Carnegie Mellons emergency alert messages are sent 
out through the CMU Alerts 
system, which is operated 
by emergency alert vendor 
SendWordNow. According to 
the of?cial CMU Alerts website, the system noti?es the 
university community when 
theres a signi?cant campus emergency or weather 
event.
We classify the threats 
into two levels, said Madelyn Miller, director of Environmental Health & Safety 
(EHS). One of them would 
be imminent danger: tornado, shooter on campus. And 
those just get blasted. Then 
theres the other threats: 
power outage, water main 
break. Those go out slower. 
Nobodys really in danger. 
Those go out without a rush, 
and they get passed through 
different people. If its not an 
imminent danger, it goes out 
through a slower method.
Miller said that only 63 
percent of the undergraduate 
population is signed up for 
CMU Alerts.
I wish we had 100 percent enrollment, said Lieutenant Gary Scheimer of the 
University Police. Scheimer 
said that he is always concerned about members of the 
campus community who are 
not signed up for emergency 
Alerts.
First-year Bachelor of 
Computer Science and Art 
student Henry Armero admitted that he only signed up 
for CMU Alerts about three 
weeks ago. I didnt really 
know about it, he said.
Even among those signed 
up for the system, some people still do not receive alerts.
The Tartan had an editorial saying that, I signed 
up for SendWordNow, and I 
didnt get called,  Miller said. 
Im concerned about that, 
because we want everybody 
to be on SendWordNow. Im 
hoping that these tests would 
be able to ?nd any bugs in the 
system, if there are any. Nobody ever followed up. After 
our recent test, nobody came 
back and said, Hey, I was 
signed up and didnt get the 
message. 
Miller sent a special test 
alert to a Tartan staff member who said that she had 
never received any alerts, but 
had not reported the failure 
to EHS. Records con?rmed 
that the staff member was 
registered for alerts; that 
the phone number listed in 
the system was correct; and 
that special alert was sent 
out to her. However, the staff 
member did not receive the 
special alert. Miller said that 
the problem likely lies either 
with Sprint, the students 
phone service provider, or 
with the aggregator, a system 
that directs messages to service providers.
Once it gets to the aggregator, we have no control as 
to where it goes out, Miller 
said. So the aggregator goes, 
Oh, heres Madelyn Millers phone number, it goes 
to AT&T. Heres somebody 
elses, it goes somewhere 
else. Thats what an aggregator does. Theres no company that can do anything 
about the aggregators.
EHS sent out a survey to 
a select group of Sprint users 
on Thursday to see if others 
have been missing alert messages. Miller encouraged any 
student who has experienced 
a problem with emergency 
alerts to contact EHS.
According to Miller, the 
university ?rst instituted an 
emergency alert system after 
9/11. We really did a huge 
rewrite for that system, Miller said. And then in 2004, 
we had a huge power transformer that knocked out 10

The ?nalized Joint Funding Committee (JFC) student 
organization budget allocations were not released on 
Thursday, as expected, because the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) failed to 
maintain quorum at a joint 
meeting with Undergraduate 
Student Senate to approve 
them.
The problem was because the debates over these 
changes took longer than anticipated, GSA wasnt able to 
maintain membership, said 
junior lighting design major 
Jon Mark, a student Senator 
and Vice President-elect for 
Finance. People walked out 
because they had other commitments.
Senate voted to approve 
the budgets as they were, 
with only three changes: Restoring the Activities Board 
(AB) food budget to the 
amount AB requested; restoring AB Techs food budget 
and projected revenue to the 
amount requested; and eliminating a $400 line item for 
student government debates 
from The Tartans budget, because it is covered in the student body presidents budget.
GSA will vote on the 
budgets during its normally scheduled meeting on 
Wednesday.
If GSA makes any additional changes or doesnt 
agree with any of Senates 
changes, then its going to 
go back to Senate at Senates meeting, and if Senate 
doesnt approve it at that 
meeting, then we go into a really weird limbo place, Mark 
said. Nobody really knows 
what happens then.
Mark said that he does not 
think that getting the changes approved by GSA will be a 
problem. The changes that 
weve made are very reasonable, we think, so I dont anticipate it being an issue with 
GSA, he said.

The speakers for the 2012 
commencement were of?-
cially announced on Friday. 
The 2012 keynote speaker is 
Patrick Wilson. The student 
speaker is recently-graduated 
creative writing major Caroline Kessler. Wilson, who 
graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a degree in acting in 
1995, has played roles in movies such as The Phantom of the 
Opera, Watchmen, and Young 
Adult. He currently stars in 
CBSs A Gifted Man. Wilson 
was nominated for a Golden 
Globe and an Emmy Award for 
his role in the 2003 miniseries 
Angels in America. He is also 
a university trustee. His wife, 
Dagmara Dominczyk (98), is 
also a Carnegie Mellon School 
of Drama alum.
Im delighted to meet and 
speak with the very distinguished and accomplished 
class of 2012, Wilson said in a 
university press release. Who 
knows, the paths ahead might 
lead any one of this years 
graduates back to CMU to 
serve as the keynote speaker 
at commencement someday.
Reaction to the commencement speaker has been generally positive. I saw him in 
Insidious, where he plays a 
father who saves his son from 
being eaten in another dimension, said senior Bachelor 
of Computer Science and Art 
student Tim Sherman. Its 
kind of silly, but Im kind of 
excited to see him speak based 
on that.
Kessler graduated in December. She said that she will 
be speaking about the unique 
community that Carnegie 
Mellon provides. Ill be talking about sort of how atypical 
Carnegie Mellon graduates 
are, and how we really attack 
the worlds problems in an interesting way, Kessler said. 
Its a weird place, but I think 
a place that many people call 
home after their time there.
Kessler is looking forward 
to the ceremony. Itll be really 
nice to be back for commencement to see all my friends, and 
to have all the pomp and circumstance, because we dont 
have a December graduation, 
she said. Im really excited 
to do it. Its a huge honor. It 
should be a kick.
The university also announced this years honorary 
degrees, to be presented at 
commencement. Opera singer 
Rene Fleming will receive a 
Doctor of Fine Arts degree; author and activist Temple Grandin will receive a Doctor of Science and Technology degree; 
writer and humanitarian Ruth 
Gruber will receive a Doctor of 
Humane Letters degree; Nobel Prize-winning economist 
Daniel Kahneman will receive 
a Doctor of Business Practice 
degree; and local businessman Richard P. Simmons will 
receive a Doctor of Science 
and Technology degree.

Student Information Online (SIO) suffered technical 
dif?culties this week that delayed registration by 24 hours 
for most of the student body.
According to University 
Registrar John Papinchak, the 
central database that runs SIO 
was overwhelmed by the increase in traf?c from students 
planning and registering their 
schedules. It was a perfect 
storm, and [SIO] got slower as 
the day went on, Papinchak 
said.
The shift from Online Registration (OLR) to SIO is part 
of the goal of streamlining the 
student experience at Carnegie Mellon. The eventual plan 
is to enable students to do all 
their university-related business and scheduling from one 
central location that unites 
OLR with the schedule-planning utility of ScheduleMan. 
Papinchak said that this is an 
objective the student body has 
long desired.
However, while the central 
database was prepared for a 
higher demand, the system 
was not designed to handle 
that much internet traf?c.
Its tough to plan for all of 
the traf?c, Papinchak said.
On Monday, Papinchak 
decided to delay registration 
in order to increase the computing resources available to 
SIO, so that more connections 
could be maintained at any 
given time. Since the reset on 
Tuesday, the system has not 
experienced signi?cant slowdown.
Student reactions to these 
problems have varied greatly. 
Some students have been 
patient with the new system. 
Im sure theyre still working 
out the glitches, said Brittany 
Robertson, a junior chemistry 
major.
Others even bene?ted from 
the delay. Visvesvaran Subramanian, a junior international 
relations and politics major, 
said, Technically I bene?ted 
from SIO shutting down, since 
I was unable to meet with my 
adviser beforehand.
Papinchak said that he 
received a great deal of feedback about the dif?culties, 
some of it very frustrated.
Students should use the 
feedback button [on SIO], 
Papinchak said. Real people 
read it. According to Papinchak, the team working on 
the system wants to know 
what it can do to make registration go more smoothly 
for students in the upcoming 
year.
Papinchaks immediate future does look busy. 
We are going to debrief 
and make things better during the summer, he said. 
This problem will not occur 
next semester, according to 
Papinchak, who cited added 
measures such as spreading 
students over 20-minute time 
slots instead of 30-minute 
ones to reduce strain on the 
system.

Lecture Preview
Reinforcing a cars GPS 
directions with tactile stimuli 
keeps some drivers eyes on 
the road longer, according to 
a recent study conducted at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction 
Institute (HCII) and at AT&T 
Labs produced a driving simulation using a new steering 
wheel lined with 20 vibrating actuators. Vibrating in a 
clockwise pattern signalled 
the driver to turn right, while 
a counter-clockwise pattern 
indicated a left turn. The 
team tested the use of steering wheel feedback in the 
simulation on a group of 16 
drivers under age 36 and 17 
drivers over age 65.
Compared to the standard 
audio instructions provided 
by a normal GPS, drivers of all 
ages in the simulation spent 
more time looking at the 
road when they had access to 
the tactile information in the 
steering wheel as well. 
Combining audio, tactile, 
and graphical information, 
however, was only helpful to 
younger drivers, who favored 
the added visual instructions 
over the audio version.
Our ?ndings suggest 
that, as navigation systems 
become more elaborate, it 
would be best to personalize 
the sensory feedback system 
based, at least in part, on the 
drivers age, said SeungJun 
Kim, a systems scientist in 
the HCII, in a university press 
release. 
For older motorists, the 
study said, it may be better 
for future GPS systems to 
keep a drivers cognitive 
load small rather than be 
concerned with dividing the 
drivers attention.

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced 
last Monday that Carnegie 
Mellon will be a partner in the 
citys Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a 
consortium of academic institutions and technology companies with research space in 
Brooklyn.
With support from New 
York City and the citys Metropolitan Transit Authority, 
CUSP will research and develop new technologies for 
cities facing challenges in 
transportation, energy ef?ciency, public health, and 
other areas. Carnegie Mellon 
joins New York University; 
the University of Toronto; 
the City University of New 
York; and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay 
 among other university 
partners  in the project; 
IBM and Cisco are among 
the companies involved. 
CUSP will confer academic 
degrees in the sciences or engineering, will start immediate work in Brooklyn, and is 
expecting to fully renovate a 
building there as a research 
hub by 2017.
Carnegie Mellons participation in the CUSP proposal 
has been led by Richard McCollough, the universitys 
vice president for research, 
and James Garrett, the head 
of the civil and environmental engineering department.
The center is the second 
stage of Bloombergs Applied 
Science NYC initiative, which 
in the ?rst stage last December announced a joint technology campus between 
Cornell University and the 
Technion in Israel. The mayor 
hopes to increase New Yorks 
presence in applied sciences 
and to foster connections 
with major research universities worldwide.

Underage Drinking
April 20, 2012
University Police were 
summoned to Mudge House 
for an intoxicated female. The 
female had become ill and 
needed to be transported to 
the hospital for additional 
care. Because the call was initiated by a staff member, alcohol amnesty did not apply. 
The female, who was under 
21 years of age, will be cited 
by mail for underage drinking.
Unconscious Student
April 21, 2012
City of Pittsburgh police 
along with University Police 
were on a patrol detail on 
Beeler Street when they were 
dispatched to a call for an intoxicated male. Upon arrival, 
the of?cers found the male 
unconscious with blood on 
his face. City medics took the 
male, a Carnegie Mellon student, to the hospital.
Public Intoxication
April 21, 2012
While working the Passion Pit concert on the Mall, 
University Police were alerted about a male who was 
unconscious on the ground 
near Doherty Hall. Carnegie 
Mellon and Pittsburgh EMS 
responded, but were unable 
to rouse the male due to his 
heavily intoxicated state. It 
was determined that he was 
a University of Pittsburgh student. Pittsburgh medics transported him to the hospital.
De?ant Trespass
April 21, 2012
While working the Passion Pit concert on the Mall, 
University Police observed 
four individuals on the rooftop of Wean Hall. An of?cer 
responded and identi?ed all 
four as Carnegie Mellon students who had used a tool to 
bypass the restrictive feature 
on the freight elevator to access prohibited areas of the 
building. All were removed 
from the roof and were cited 
internally. Facilities Management Services was alerted to 
repair the freight elevator.
Alcohol Amnesty
April 22, 2012
University Police and 
Carnegie Mellon EMS were 
dispatched to Margaret Morrison Apartments on reports 
of an intoxicated female. The 
female had reportedly consumed 20 shots of alcohol 
throughout the day and had 
passed out after returning to 
her room. Pittsburgh medics 
responded and transported 
her to UPMC Presbyterian 
Hospital for further treatment. No citations were issued, as the conditions of 
alcohol amnesty were met in 
this case.
Illegal Drug Use
April 24, 2012
University Police and Carnegie Mellon EMS were dispatched to Donner House on 
a report of a male who was 
experiencing bad side effects 
after ingesting LSD. The male 
was transported to the hospital. An investigation into the 
source of the drugs is ongoing.
Harassment
April 24, 2012
University Police took a 
report from a faculty member who was getting repeated 
mailings from an inmate who 
is incarcerated in California. 
A Carnegie Mellon detective is 
following up with the staff of 
the institution to get the mailings to stop.

buildings, and the way everybody noti?ed each other was 
through email, and of course 
without computers, there 
was no email. So we had a 
phone tree at that point, and 
the lists for the phone trees 
were on the computer.
After this incident, the 
university purchased the 
service of AlertNow, which 
provided emergency calls 
to a limited audience of 400 
people in the campus emergency operations group.
After the Virginia Tech 
shooting, the system changed 
again. It was one of those V8 
moments, where we went, 
We really need to include all 
the students,  Miller said. 
So we expanded AlertNow 
and had about 10,000 [people] on that system.
Carnegie Mellon set up 
a committee to search for a 
new emergency alert vendor, 
with emphasis on speed and 
user interface, among other 
features. The committee ultimately selected the vendor 
SendWordNow.
Scheimer said that he is 
happy with the new vendor. 
We get the info out via text 
and phone calls very quickly, 
he said.
Shreepal Shah, a sophomore information systems 
major, feels that CMU Alerts 
are good for the most part, 
because theyre pretty quick 
about getting a text or voice 
call out. Shah added that, in 
his opinion, Texting is a lot 
more convenient.
First-year mechanical engineering major Seth Cordts 
agreed. 
The texts are helpful, he 
said. But, Cordts added, The 
email seems overused.
Recent events such as the 
Pitt bomb threats have raised 
questions about when Carnegie Mellon should warn 
students about off-campus 
threats. We sent out alerts 
when theres a direct threat 
to our community, Scheimer 
said.
I had conversations about 
this with Lt. Scheimer, and 
we sort of parsed out the difference between a low-level 
threat and a threat that had 
some validity, Miller said. 
A low-level threat would 
be, somebody goes into Starbucks and writes on a coffee 
cup, Bomb at seven, and 
puts it in the bathroom. Kind 
of a low-level threat. Or an 
email. Or a note in the bathroom. These are the bomb 
threats that came out at Pitt.
If they havent already 
done so, students are encouraged to sign up for alerts at 
www.cmu.edu/alert/.
PHYLLIS KIM
Staffwriter
For the past three months, 
Pittsburgh has been making 
national headlines for the 
continuous bomb threats targeting the University of Pittsburgh, but it seems that the 
threats have ?nally come to 
a close.
On April 21, the group 
behind these threats outed 
itself, sending an email to 
The Pitt News, the universitys 
campus newspaper, and to 
Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg. In the email, the group 
promised to stop the threats 
if the university would withdraw the $50,000 reward for 
information leading to the 
members arrest. The same 
day, the offer for the reward 
was taken down from the 
universitys website and no 
bomb threats have been received since.
The anonymous group 
took responsibility for all the 
threats sent via email since 
March 30, but not any of the 
handwritten ones, including 
the ?rst ones found in a bathroom stall of the Chevron 
Science Center on Feb. 13. 
In March, the threats sped 
up, coming at a rate of two 
to four per day, with the total tally coming to more than 
155.
Its nice to know that 
its ended. My friends at 
UPitt were getting frustrated 
and annoyed, said fourthyear architecture major Joe 
Dziekan.
Neal Jaehne, a graduate 
student in the Pitt School 
of Pharmacy, said, I wasnt 
scared. It was ridiculous. 
They were so constant and 
regular. How do you take 
something like that seriously when its so regular? I 
thought it was a prank.
In the search to ?nd the 
person or people of interest, 
multiple individuals were 
brought in for questioning 
over the past months. The 
FBI, Secret Service, Department of Justice, and the Joint 
Terrorism Task Force all collaborated with local police in 
the search. On April 11, University of Pittsburgh police 
arrested Mark Lee Krangle, 
a University of Pittsburgh 
alumnus, as well as a transgender couple living in Johnston, Pa., claiming a break in 
the case. The group claiming to be behind the threats, 
however, denies that anyone 
arrested thus far was involved in the threats.
The University of Pittsburgh was not the only place 
targeted. The threats have 
also been made at other Pittsburgh educational institutions, including California 
University, Point Park University, Western Pennsylvania 
School for the Blind, and the 
Community College of Allegheny County.
As a result of the constant 
threats, University of Pittsburgh administrators took 
many measures to secure 
the safety of its students and 
faculty, vowing to keep the 
campus open and operating. 
To enter buildings, individuals were required to show Pitt 
IDs and undergo bag checks, 
and non-residents were no 
longer permitted in dorms.
When students were removed from their dormitories 
in the middle of the night, 
the university provided cots, 
blankets, and free food at 
the student union center and 
basketball gym. The school 
united; the editor-in-chief of 
The Pitt News, Michael Macagnone, said the threats led to 
a surge in school spirit. From 
what I have seen, this has 
brought the Pitt community 
together, Macagnone told 
The New York Times. The 
connections have always 
been there, with Facebook 
and social media. But this has 
been a shared experience by 
everyone on campus.
In addition, the university 
took advantage of social media tools like Twitter to keep 
students informed about the 
threats and building openings. University-run Google 
spreadsheets and Facebook 
pages informed students of 
housing options off campus. 
Even so, some students left 
their dorms and classrooms 
and were given the option 
of continuing their studies at 
home for the rest of the semester. Attendance policies 
were disregarded for these 
students.

The Port Authority approved the elimination of 
nearly half of Pittsburghs bus 
routes on Friday. The service 
cut, which will go into effect 
on Sept. 2, will eliminate 46 
routes, end service at 10 p.m. 
on all but 13 routes, and lay 
off up to 500 Port Authority

also be increased, starting 
July 1.
Among the eliminated 
routes will be the 64, which 
runs to Lawrenceville and 
the Waterfront, and weekend service for the 75, which 
runs along Ellsworth Avenue. 
Despite recent fears that the 
route would be shortened, the 
28X will continue to provide 
service to the airport.
The service cut could be 
reversed or reduced if the Port 
Authoritys current budget 
problems are alleviated.
I want to direct staff to 
also plan for the best outcome, said Guy Mattola, the 
Port Authority Boards vicechairman, in the Port Authority press release announcing 
the cuts. Make sure we are 
prepared to sustain current 
service levels so that the 
Board could later convene on 
short notice to reverse these 
cuts if an adequate funding 
solution is found.
Governor Tom Corbett said 
that the Port Authority should 
look to the transit employee 
unions to help it overcome its 
$64 million debt. 
For years past, the state 
has been able to just produce 
money and help solve that, 
but we dont have that money 
right now, Corbett said, as 
reported by The Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. I look forward 
to working with them ... but 
as you know theres got to be 
discussion between the transit 
authority and the unions as to 
the overall costs.
We are not ATMs that can 
be wrung for more cash every 
time politicians fail to live up 
to their responsibilities, said 
the president of the Local 85 
of the Amalgamated Transit 
Union, Patrick McMahon, according to the Post-Gazette. 
Every concession weve made 
in the past has led to more 
demands and more concessions.

In the original 1960s television series Star Trek, all one 
had to do was ask the ships 
computer a question and it 
would automatically search 
through every book ever written to ?nd the relevant information for the answer. This is 
what Gloriana St. Clair, Carnegie Mellons dean of University Libraries, hopes for the 
future of libraries.
St. Clair, 72, has watched 
over Carnegie Mellons books 
for nearly 15 years. Her 
lengthy career will come to 
a close in June 2013, as she 
plans to retire and spend time 
on her own research endeavors. Throughout her time at 
Carnegie Mellon, she has not 
only managed the books in 
Hunt Library, but also millions 
of others around the world.
Since 1999, St. Clair has 
been working alongside colleagues in the School of 
Computer Science to digitize 
millions of books. Digitizing 
books is the direction society 
is going in, according to St. 
Clair, who has worked in the 
library business since 1963. 
With Carnegie Mellon computer science professors Raj 
Reddy, Michael Shamos, and 
Jaime Carbonell, St. Clair developed the Million Book Project. Collaborating with several U.S. partners and a broad 
coalition of libraries and computer scientists in India and 
China, the project digitized 
over 1.5 million books and 
made them free to read on the 
internet.
Since her undergraduate 
days at the University of California, Berkeley, St. Clair has 
had an interest in the intersection between technology and 
printed texts. She originally 
received her bachelors degree 
in English in 1962, but the job 
market pushed her toward a 
career in library sciences. I 
was sitting outside a class, 
waiting for it to start, and 
there were few other people 
standing there, St. Clair said. 
They were talking about going to library school because 
there werent very many jobs 
for people in English, and 
there were a lot in library 
studies. And I thought, Hmm. 
I could do that. 
A masters in library science is mandatory for any 
practicing librarian. The ?eld 
is interdisciplinary. Library 
science utilizes management; 
information technology; education; collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information 
resources; and political economy of information.
St. Clair received her masters degree from UC Berkeley 
in 1963. And at that time, 
it was one of the top three 
schools, she said. Generally, 
you could get jobs in academic 
libraries, in public libraries, 
in special libraries, and childrens libraries.
For her library sciences 
degree, St. Clair specialized 
in technology. I was kind of 
focused on academic libraries 
and on science and technology, she said. So as soon as 
I ?nished the program, I immediately got a job as a cataloguer at the Water Regional 
Center Archives at Berkeley.
It was this initial emphasis 
on the technological aspect of 
library sciences that spurred 
St. Clairs interest in the digitization of books during the 
rest of her career as a librarian. She has held 13 different positions, working across 
multiple institutions, such as 
Pennsylvania State University, 
Texas A&M University, and 
the University of Oklahoma. 
As the digital age came into 
focus and she began her work 
at Carnegie Mellon, St. Clair 
immediately found a niche for 
her interests.
Raj Reddy was the dean of 
computer science when I came 
here as head of the library. I 
went around to all the deans 
to talk to them about what 
their needs were and what 
they wanted from the library, 
St. Clair explained. I went to 
him and walked in, and said, 
The future of libraries is digital. So we talked for an hour, 
and then he sent his colleague 
Mike Shamos over to meet 
me and make sure that I was 
a true believer that we should 
digitize books and they should 
be free to read.
This moment marked the 
start of what would become 
the Million Books Project, 
something St. Clair is very 
proud of. It began as a proof 
of concept project  she 
and her colleagues started by 
digitizing 1,000 books to see if 
the concept was feasible. The 
team then moved onto larger 
numbers and collaborated 
with international partners.
So then I became a director of Universal Libraries, which was a project that 
[Reddy] had ongoing, and 
we were interested in how 
we could manage to digitize a 
million books, St. Clair said. 
We started out by convening a bunch of librarians from 
states that dont get as much 
National Science Foundation 
money as other states, and 
that didnt work out. So he 
began to work internationally 
and work with his colleagues 
in China and India, and we 
started two Million Books 
Projects, one in China and one 
in India.
Currently, the project in 
China has managed to digitize approximately 2 million 
books, while the project in 
India digitized about 300,000.
According to St. Clair, the 
Million Books Project was in 
part the inspiration for the 
Google Books program, which 
has digitized about 20 million 
books.
The power of digitization 
is knowledge, St. Clair said. 
She cited the story of a current 
Carnegie Mellon student who 
is getting his Ph.D. in English. 
St. Clair explained that his dissertation was on Charles Darwin, and she had helped him 
use digitized copies of Darwins books for his research. 
All of Darwins books 
are digitized and searchable 
through Google Books, and 
he doesnt need to read every 
single page; he can use key 
words to ?nd the bits of information hes interested in, St. 
Clair said.
This is St. Clairs goal for 
the future of libraries. She 
hopes that someday people 
all over the world will have 
the information they need because of digitization.
As for libraries being potentially threatened from such 
easy and accessible knowledge through digitization and 
the internet, St. Clair isnt 
worried. She remains con?-
dent that neither libraries nor 
librarians will ever go out of 
business. 
They will always have a 
use as long as books need to 
be paid for, as long as people 
need help sorting through information, as long as people 
need help differentiating between good and bad information, she said. People will 
always need libraries.

Consuming berries is berry good for your brain
Researchers at Brigham 
and Womens Hospital in 
Boston recently found that 
women who ate berries frequently over a period of a few 
years showed less decrease in 
brain function than women 
who consumed berries less 
frequently. The team surveyed 
16,000 women in their 50s 
and 60s about their eating 
habits and had them complete 
a series of cognitive tests when 
the women reached their 70s. 
Information about the womens education, income, and 
other socioeconomic factors 
that may affect cognitive functioning were considered in the 
analysis.
The ?ndings showed that 
women who consumed berries at least once a week were 
able to prolong their normal 
cognitive functioning by 1.5 to 
2.5 years. The cognitive bene?ts of eating berries is not an 
entirely new ?nding, but past 
studies only involved animals 
and a small number of people.

Potential biological cure for concrete cancer
A team of engineers at 
Northumbria University in 
Newcastle, England, are developing a technique of healing cracks in concrete and 
preventing further cracks 
from developing. The trick? 
Bacteria.
Alan Richardson, senior 
lecturer in construction at 
Northumbria University, uses 
a species of ground-borne 
bacteria called bacillus megaterium that can feed off yeast, 
urea, and minerals present 
in concrete. Once the bacteria consumes the nutrients, it 
breeds and spreads throughout the concrete, blocking 
pores, ?lling cracks, and preventing further deterioration 
from occurring. Richardson 
hopes that this technique 
could be the future cure for 
concrete cancer, which is 
caused by the swelling and 
breaking of concrete which 
does billions of dollars of damage to buildings.

MIT researchers create dustand dirt-repelling glass
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a technique for producing glass that 
prevents fogging and glare 
and resists dirt and water. The 
glass surface contains tiny 
nanotextures that interact 
with light in a way that yields 
no glare. The nanotextures are 
also able to repel water, dust, 
and dirt, keeping the surface 
of the glass clean.
The team hopes that the 
glass can eventually be produced inexpensively and used 
in common applications like 
smartphone and television 
screens, as well as car windshields. Even solar panels, the 
team argues, could signi?-
cantly bene?t from this technology since they can lose ef?-
ciency over time as their glass 
surfaces accumulate dirt and 
hinders their ability absorb 
energy from the sun.

Thinking in foreign tongues yields more rational decisions
A recent study shows that 
thinking through a problem 
in a non-native language leads 
to more rational decisionmaking. In one experiment 
in the study, researchers gave 
participants $15 each. For $1, 
they could bet on a coin toss. 
If they won, they received an 
additional $1.50, but if they 
lost, they received nothing. 
Statistically, the researchers 
explained, the participants 
would have made money in 
the experiment if they always 
chose to bet.
The team found that when 
the native English speakers were given instructions 
in Spanish, they chose to bet 
more often than participants 
who were given instructions in 
English. The researchers concluded that a foreign language 
has less emotional resonance; 
those instructed in English 
likely focused on the fear of 
losing each bet, while those 
instructed in Spanish reacted 
less emotionally.

Warm ocean water chipping away at Antarcticas ice
Most of the ice being lost 
from the Antarctic ice sheet is 
a result of warm ocean water 
eating away at the edges of 
the continent, according to a 
recent study. The team, led by 
the British Antarctic Survey, 
used a satellite laser to track 
the size and movement of the 
outer edges of the continent, 
which consist of ice shelves 
that jut out over the ocean 
waters.
The team found that the 
shrinking of the ice shelves 
could not be explained by the 
presence of warm air alone. 
Instead, they concluded that 
warm ocean water is likely 
melting the ice sheets from 
below. The scientists explained that this ?nding could 
signi?cantly affect estimates 
of sea-level rise due to the loss 
of Antarctic ice loss induced by 
a warming climate.

Study ?nds speci?c cells in birds brains aid in navigation
Researchers at the Baylor 
College of Medicine in Texas 
recently identi?ed cells in pigeons brains that allow birds 
to map out Earths magnetic 
?eld, which the birds utilize 
in their navigation. The team 
found evidence that the cells 
in the birds brains record information about the strength 
and direction of the magnetic 
?eld, and that the information 
is likely coming from the birds 
inner ears.
The basic steps of how 
birds navigate by magnetism 
were generally known beforehand, but the details of how 
and where that information 
was recorded within the birds 
brains had been unknown.

Bacterial infections like E. 
coli, salmonella, listeria, and 
staph are culprits for millions 
of fatalities each year. Viral 
pathogens like HIV and SARS 
are an increasing threat to 
public health, with the World 
Health Organization estimating that over 30 million people 
are living with HIV and more 
than 2 million new cases are 
emerging annually. At one 
time, humans may have had 
the capability to be immune to 
such diseases.
Today, researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon are searching through evolutionary history to produce a lost peptide 
that could ?ght these human 
pathogens once more. Associate chemistry professor 
Danith Ly recently led a breakthrough in synthetic peptide 
manufacturing that may help 
pave a path toward ?ghting 
HIV, SARS, and dangerous 
bacterial infections.
Peptides are fairly small 
chains of amino acids coded 
by DNA. They are of particular interest to pharmaceutical 
corporations because they are 
easily created and can have 
diverse formations with a relatively small number of chemical blocks. But a peptides 
shining quality is also its major drawback: The molecules 
?imsy nature and its inability 
to bind makes it nearly impossible to work with in a laboratory setting.
The problem has interested 
Ly for decades.
I always thought in the 
back of my mind that I wanted 
to solve this problem, Ly said. 
It has been around for the last 
40 years or so; a lot of people 
have talked about trying to develop peptides for therapeutic 
[purposes].
The natural world has created an alternative to combat 
this problem by creating cyclic 
peptides. 
We found that nature has 
done an amazing thing in the 
past 4 million years or so, Ly 
said. With their seemingly circular, knotted structures, the 
cyclic peptides are stronger, 
more rigid versions of their 
?imsy cousins.
They have disul?de bridges that are connecting the 
strands together similar to a 
bicycle wheel. They have these 
reinforcements, Ly said. You 
can take this peptide, put it in 
water, heat to boiling, and the 
conformation remains rigid 
because everything is stitched 
in place.
The cyclic peptide of interest was RTD-1, a peptide that 
was found in humans until 
some 9 million years ago, 
when a mutated gene eventually eradicated the bodys ability to recognize the peptides 
existence. Today, it naturally 
occurs in plants and some 
primates, like baboons and 
rhesus monkeys. The peptide 
has the ability to invade the 
cell wall and destroy invading 
bacteria.
Although RTD-1 had been 
isolated in the lab before, Ly 
explained that doing so is a 
tedious and dif?cult process. 
The complex bonds between 
the peptides call for large 
quantities of pure chemicals 
in the lab. In working with 
RTD-1, Ly and his team were 
searching for an alternative 
binding method that would 
make the peptide easy to produce without compromising 
its potent effect on pathogens.
A solution, it appears, had 
already existed. Understanding that the code for RTD-1 
had once been in the human 
genome, Ly proposed that the 
peptide could be structured 
with hydrogen bonds found in 
human DNA.
In the lab, the team was 
able to piece together a synthetic RTD-1 peptide  which 
they called RTD-1M  with 
the hydrogen bonds. Then, 
they tested their Frankenstein 
peptide against four bacteria: 
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium.
Their analysis showed 
that RTD-1M, like the natural 
RTD-1, could prove effective 
against all four bacteria.
Because of the unique way 
peptides ?ght bacterial cells, 
they have very promising effects in medical treatment. 
Antibiotics, unlike peptides, 
can easily become ineffective 
on mutated bacteria.
That is very important, 
because these pathogens rapidly mutate, Ly said, so even 
if you take some of the most 
potent antibiotic today, if you 
were to continue taking this 
antibiotic for a period of six 
months to one year, eventually its going to develop a resistance. Ly explained that even 
if the bacteria had become 
resistant to the antibiotic, its 
cell wall would still succumb 
to the peptide. The peptide, in 
essence, has the possibility to 
overcome resistance.
As for viral infections like 
HIV, research has shown that 
the peptide is effective at stopping the disease from spreading. Scientists, however, are 
still trying to ?gure out how 
it works. According to Ly, researchers who have incubated 
cells with RTD-1 and HIV have 
shown that the effectiveness 
of HIV is signi?cantly reduced.
Looking to the future, Ly 
hopes that he can further 
pursue this promising area of 
research. He is excited by the 
potential synthetic peptides 
could have in developing countries as well as in America.
The long-term goal is to 
develop these things for the 
developed country to use, 
but also for the poor and the 
underdeveloped regions, so 
if we can make this thing for 
the cost of a dollar per pop or 
something, maybe less  that 
would be useful, I think, Ly 
said.
Ly is pursuing funding for 
similar future projects. His research currently points toward 
a new way of thinking about 
medication.
I think the main takehome lesson is that we could 
make this thing extremely 
cheap, and it has the potential to not develop resistance 
because of the mechanism 
of binding and the structure 
of the bacteria, as compared 
to small-molecule drugs, Ly 
said.

HOW THINGS WORKNoreaster to blame for snowfall threat
AMRITHA PARTHASARATHY
Staffwriter
The recent threat of heavy 
snow may seem like odd 
weather for late April. Although the prediction of snow 
in Pittsburgh fell through, 
more than two feet of snow 
fell about 70 miles away in 
Laurel Summit, Pa., according to The Washington Post. 
The culprit? A weather system 
called a noreaster, a type of 
storm that typically passes 
through the East Coast and 
quickly drops large amounts 
of rain and snow.
Noreasters generally occur where moisture and cold 
air are abundant. They are 
cyclones that resemble hurricanes and create hurricanelevel winds. In coastal regions, 
the winds generate huge 
surfs that can result in beach 
erosion, cause coastal ?ooding, and make surfers wait in 
anticipation. 
Noreasters get their name 
from the direction of their 
winds. According to Howstuffworks.com, A noreaster is 
named for the winds that blow 
in from the northeast and 
drive the storm up the East 
Coast along the Gulf Stream, a 
band of warm water that lies 
off the Atlantic coast.
A noreaster begins its life 
as a low pressure air system 
with counterclockwise winds; 
this can be found in the Gulf 
coast winds that start off the 
coast of Florida. The system 
circulates along the coast from 
Florida and moves upward, 
essentially being pushed by 
the Gulf Stream, gaining 
warm air and moisture from 
the Atlantic Ocean as heavy 
northeastern winds push the 
system up the East Coast.
Another key element in 
the formation of a noreaster 
is a high pressure system with 
winds that move cold air down 
from the Arctic. The winds of 
the noreaster collide with the 
cold Arctic winds, and since 
cold air is heavier than warm 
air, the cold air acts as a wedge 
and causes the warm moist air 
to rise and form precipitation 
like rain and snow.
During East Coast winters, 
noreasters are quite common. However, only some 
have the momentum to generate enough precipitation 
and wind to cause problems 
on land. The converging point 
of the low pressure and high 
pressure systems is the location where the most heavy 
precipitation and snowfall 
occur, lessening as one moves 
further away.
There are two general 
types of noreasters. Offshoreforming noreasters refer to 
storms that move east from 
the East Coast. They result in 
heavy snowfall and precipitation and eventually get blown 
off the East Coast from the 
Canadian jet stream up north. 
Onshore-forming noreasters 
move west from the East 
Coast, resulting in large 
amounts of rain and winds 
but not as heavy as those in 
offshore-forming noreasters.
During a noreaster, thick, 
dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Even 
after the storm passes, the 
dark clouds linger for several 
days. Temperatures fall signi?cantly due to the cool air 
from the northeastern winds. 
During the storm, all types of 
precipitation can occur, including rain, snow, and hail. 
The high wind gusts can also 
reach hurricane level and 
even gain a small eye, much 
like that of a hurricane.
Depending on the severity 
of the storm, airports, major 
highways, and interstates often get shut down for a few 
days. Power failures often occur as electrical wiring gets 
disrupted due to high winds, 
ice, and snow.
In the U.S., the area from 
Virginia to the New England coast, Quebec, and 
Atlantic Canada are prone to 
noreasters, which often occur 
in the winter and early spring. 
Although the season matters 
for the formation of the cold 
core of a noreaster, more important are the right conditions, namely the high and 
low pressure collision.

Noreasters, large weather systems that typically move up the East Coast, drop large amounts of precipitation.
Stress found to wreak havoc on immune system
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Junior Staffwriter
Stress is no stranger to 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
and unfortunately in todays 
society, stress is prevalent in 
many peoples lives. Faced 
with this issue, a team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
recently found a direct correlation between increased 
psychological stresses and a 
decrease in the bodys ability 
to cope with disease.
The team, led by psychology professor Sheldon Cohen, 
observed that an increase in 
stress levels led to increased 
levels of a hormone called 
cortisol, which has been studied and identi?ed as a stressrelated hormone. 
Scientists understand that 
cortisol plays an important 
role in various daily functions as it circulates in the 
bloodstream, so increased 
levels of the hormone could 
have adverse effects on the 
body.
The study, recently published in the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of the 
Sciences, focused on how 
increased levels of cortisol 
contributed to the bodys 
reduced ability to ?ght off 
disease.
Cohens group found that 
stress increased the symptoms of in?ammatory diseases such as the common cold, 
cardiovascular disease, and 
asthma. Symptoms caused by 
these diseases like sneezing, 
coughing, and runny nose 
happen when the immune 
system responds in excess to 
the disease pathogens. Cohen said that his team aimed 
to understand why stressed 
people were more likely to 
experience the symptoms 
caused by these diseases.
The human bodys immune system is a massive 
network that produces and 
disperses chemicals needed 
to ?ght disease. With in?ammatory diseases, the immune 
system releases pro-in?ammatory proteins called cytokines that go to the area of 
the infection and orchestrate 
the immune response. The 
key to ?ghting diseases is to 
have just the right amount 
of these pro-in?ammatory 
proteins. When there are too 
many, thats when symptoms 
appear.
Cortisol plays a large role 
in regulating the amount of 
cytokines present to ?ght 
the infection. Cohens team 
found that under stress, the 
immune cells cannot interact with cortisol, preventing 
the regulation of cytokines. 
Therefore, highly stressed 
people will have unregulated production of cytokines, 
leading to a weaker immune 
system.
Cohens team included 
researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, who 
carried out interviews with 
adult participants of the 
study to understand what 
levels of stress they were experiencing. Cohen explained 
that their stress analysis 
interviews were intensive 
and questioned participants 
about major events over the 
last year of their lives and 
considered how threatening 
these events would be to an 
average person. These interviews were key in drawing 
the link between stress and 
immune response.
We had been trying to 
do this [research] for a long 
time, Cohen said, but this 
time we really nailed the 
pathway. Cohen and his 
team found the study extremely rewarding because 
they believe their results can 
be applied to a broad range of 
diseases.

Daniel Eisenstein of Harvard University gave the annual Buhl Lecture in the Mellon Institute auditorium last 
Tuesday, discussing Dark 
Energy and Cosmic Sound. 
Eisenstein is a professor of 
astronomy at Harvard and is 
the director of the third phase 
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Much of his work 
has explored baryon acoustic 
oscillations in the early universe, the phenomenon referred to as cosmic sound in 
the talks title.
The Buhl Lecture is an annual event held by the physics department in which a 
recognized physicist speaks 
on a current topic in physics at a level geared toward a 
broader audience, according 
to the events website. Past 
guest speakers have discussed 
quantum computing, dark 
matter, and microbiology, 
among other topics. Current 
Secretary of Energy Steven 
Chu spoke on single molecule 
biology in 2003.
Provost Mark Kamlet introduced Tuesdays talk, which 
attracted about 200 students, 
faculty, and community members to the Mellon Institute. 
This year marks the 17th 
lecture since the Buhl series 
was restarted in 1996. Mellon 
College of Science Dean Fred 
Gilman, who holds the Buhl 
chair in the physics department, introduced Eisenstein.
Eisensteins lecture progressed from broad historical 
questions on the nature of 
the expansion of the universe 
into progressively more specialized results from recently 
acquired data. He began with 
a short introduction to the 
idea of dark energy, the substance required to cause the 
universe to expand at measured rates.
Understanding the rate of 
expansion of the universe involves precise measurements 
of the rate of movement and 
position of other celestial 
objects moving away from 
Earth. The dif?culty of determining these cosmic distances was one of the themes of 
Eisensteins lecture.
Imagine you want to determine the distance to a star 
you see in the sky. To you, two 
stars might appear equally 
bright, but one star might be 
dimmer and closer while the 
other is brighter but farther 
away. This problem applies 
to larger-scale structures as 
well, such as galaxies and 
clusters of galaxies. Astronomers therefore try to ?nd consistent events and structures 
they can use as standard candles or standard rulers that 
aid in measuring distances 
anywhere in the universe. 
An example of a standard 
candle is a Type Ia supernova, 
which has a known and very 
consistent brightness. When 
supernovae are observed 
from Earth, the distance can 
be calculated based on the 
difference in apparent luminosity with the known light 
curve.
Eisenstein focused on a 
standard ruler that he helped 
develop. Baryon acoustic oscillations, he explained, are 
visible patterns in the density 
of matter in the modern universe, caused by events that 
happened when the universe 
was only 400,000 years old. 
The patterns have features 
that repeat every 490 million 
light years, allowing astronomers to determine distances 
at large scales.
The ?nal part of Eisensteins talk discussed results 
from the SDSS and how they 
related to earlier theoretical 
predictions.
The problem [with largescale theoretical models], 
Eisenstein said, is that you 
need a lot of data. 
The SDSS has provided 
much of this data, and SDSSIII has a survey dedicated to 
studying baryon acoustic oscillations, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey 
(BOSS). It maps distant cosmic objects like quasars to 
test theories about the early. 
Eisenstein explained that data 
gathered by the BOSS thus far 
matches the predictions made 
by baryon acoustic oscillation 
theory.
As the third phase of the 
SDSS continues over the next 
two years, the BOSS and three 
other sky surveys aim to create 
an even more complete picture of the universe. It is these 
data sets that help Eisenstein 
and his colleagues to more 
precisely answer questions 
about the early universe and 
its continued expansion, helping us better understand the 
world we live in.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
A6  thetartan.org/forum The Tartan  April 30, 2012
At the close of every school year, The 
Tartan reassesses the years events. We 
present here a list of the people and 
happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and 
events that had a positive effect on the 
campus community and the world at 
large; thorns go to those that have 
negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to Bill Dietrich. His 
posthumous donation of $265 
million, in honor of his mother, is 
both generous and touching.  We are 
honored to be a part of the Dietrich 
family legacy. 
A thorn for the announcement 
of Carnegie Mellons Rwanda campus. Rwanda is a country 
with a history ?lled with violence, 
genocide, and infringements on 
free speech (to name a few). Carnegie Mellon stands for none of those 
things on its Pittsburgh campus, and 
administrators should have held 
public discussions before entering 
into this partnership.
A thistle for Pittsburghs growing ?lm industry. High-pro?le 
movies in production, such as The 
Dark Knight Rises, brought some 
much-deserved attention to Pittsburghs great qualities. Moreover, 
movie ?lming means a boost to the 
citys economy.
A thorn for the announcement 
of more Port Authority bus 
route cuts. The proposed cuts would 
greatly affect students and Pittsburghs transit users. Measures must 
be taken to ensure that transportation to important locations is available to students.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellons 
very own Quidditch team, the 
CMU Marauders. The sport has been 
a growing trend on college campuses, and it is great to ?nally have a 
team at Carnegie Mellon.
A thorn for tuition increases. 
Even though we met our $1 
billion Inspire Innovation campaign 
goal, tuition still increased for next 
year. The fact that Carnegie Mellon 
has received $1 billion. Yet students 
are still asked to pay an even greater 
amount of money is preposterous. 
Carnegie Mellon is already one of the 
top 10 most expensive schools in the 
United States, a title we shouldnt be 
proud of.
A thistle to AB Concerts and 
Shows for their choice of entertainers for Spring Carnival 2012. 
Attracting headliners such as comedians Streeter Seidell and Nick Offerman  as well as musical performer 
Passion Pit  truly livened up Spring 
Carnival and enticed students to attend the shows. Hopefully Activities 
Board can get equally entertaining 
performers for future Spring Carnival concerts and shows.
A thorn to Mark Zuckerberg. 
His stop at Carnegie Mellon last 
semester was exciting, but the fact 
that the talk was limited to students 
with technical majors  and that it 
allowed for no direct media or press 
coverage  was directly opposed to 
his goal of creating a more open ?ow 
of information.
A thistle to this years student 
body president candidates. 
This years student body president 
elections had an unprecedented 
?ve tickets. This shows how many 
students care about student government and want to have a voice in the 
university system. The tickets each 
brought their own ideas and showed 
how diverse our school is.
A thorn for the bomb threats at 
the University of Pittsburgh this 
semester. The threats were extremely disruptive, forcing professors at 
Pitt to cancel classes and frustrating students to the point where they 
moved off campus. We hope that the 
threats will not continue next semester and that the perpetrator(s) of 
these threats will be prosecuted.
A thistle to the University of 
Pittsburgh Police Department, 
the Carnegie Mellon University Police, and the Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Police for their service this semester. 
During these trying times, their work 
has helped keep students and faculty 
safe. Our deepest gratitude goes out 
to them.
A thorn for the Facebook Timeline update. Facebook has undergone many changes over the past 
year, not all of them good. With its 
cover photo and confusing format, 
Timeline is conducive to stalking but 
not much else.
A thistle for the new Student 
Information Online (SIO) integration with Online Registration. 
This enhanced interface has been 
very helpful. The new SIO improves 
planning course schedules, and 
it looks much nicer than the old 
system.
A thorn for SIOs lack of stress 
testing before registration. 
When every student has to use the 
same method to register for classes, 
failing to ensure that the system can 
handle the traf?c is unacceptable, 
especially for a renowned computer 
science school like Carnegie Mellon.
A thistle for the Occupy movement. The motion showed a 
level of interest and activism in 
the current state of the country that, 
regardless of ones political views, is 
admirable and preferable to rampant 
apathy.
A thorn for the Kiva Han and 
Waf?e Shop closings. Their absence is devastating not only for the 
decrease in delicious food, but also 
because it marks the downfall of the 
local shops. Small businesses serving 
hyperlocal constituents seem to have 
no place in Pittsburgh  Kiva Han is 
being replaced by a larger chain restaurant, the Bagel Factory.
A thistle for Carnegie Mellons efforts to run entirely 
on wind-generated power in 2012. 
Green measures such as wind power 
may be more expensive, but they are 
worth it in consideration of the environmental impact.
A thorn to Pennsylvania State 
University for its handling of 
the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Universities must remember to always 
put the safety of their students 
and the general population before 
reputation.
A thistle for the announced revival of the critically acclaimed 
television series Arrested Development. The show will be starting up 
again with a full-length movie and a 
new 10-episode season in early 2013. 
Best of all, the shows original characters will still be there, playing the 
roles weve come to know and love. 
Start practicing your chicken dance.
A thorn to the North Shore 
Connector. Its incredibly expensive construction under the Allegheny River seems wasteful in the 
City of Bridges.
A thistle for the student body 
president impeachment motion. While the need to call for a motion to impeach was saddening, it 
shows that Undergraduate Student 
Senate wanted to take a stand and 
ensure that student government was 
running properly. Senate members 
made a statement that a student government position is a real position of 
power, and not something to ?ll out 
a rsum.
A thorn to Google+. The social 
network has Hangouts, but no 
one to hang with. Beyond that, it integrated its ghost town into everyday 
search results, diluting the quality of 
its searches in a desperate attempt to 
get traction in the social networking 
sphere.
A thistle to the improved 
SquirrelMail. SquirrelMail has 
traditionally been so bad that Carnegie Mellons naturally tech-savvy 
students have abandoned it in favor 
of email clients like Gmail. Heres to 
SquirrelMails facelift and the eventual hope that it becomes even better.
A thorn to College Magazine for 
naming Carnegie Mellon the 
ninth-most hipster campus in the 
United States. At Carnegie Mellon, 
we dont believe in labels.
A thistle to President Jared Cohon for his 15 years of service 
to Carnegie Mellon. Since we will be 
welcoming a new president in 2013, 
it seems ?tting to thank him now for 
his work at this school and all the 
progress that has occurred under his 
leadership.
THISTLES & THORNS
SIO should be able to handle student traf?c
KATIE CHIRONIS
Most services at Carnegie Mellon 
would probably be best described 
as perfectly adequate. Health 
Services system? Eh, it works. The 
CAMEO library interface? It is hard 
to use, but seems to run all right. 
Blackboard? Its a pain in the butt, 
but well live, I guess. 
The Student Information Online 
(SIO) resource? It has a few glitches, but up until last Monday it was 
about as perfectly adequate as a system can get.
Last Monday, as with most registration days, I dragged myself out 
of bed at 9 a.m. to register. About 
10 minutes prior to my start time I 
noticed SIO was getting a little slow 
and then, without warning, it collapsed like a shoddy FEMA trailer. 
Suddenly SIO went from perfectly 
adequate to far below standards. 
Some hours later, The HUB reported 
on its website that everyones registration time was delayed by one day.
At ?rst, my question was, Why 
didnt anyone in the registration department bother to have the system 
stress tested before using it for registration? 
But after thinking a moment, the 
answer is easy: At a school prized 
for being top notch in nearly every 
?eld, Carnegie Mellon is happy with 
its internal services being perfectly 
adequate. Not good  not even 
great  just barely serviceable and, 
in cases like this, non-functioning at 
crucial times.
SIO has actually been a prime example of this over the last year. The 
service has been aiming to replace 
ScheduleMan.org for a while now, 
even going so far as to produce an 
oddly similar interface. 
Even though the service was 
uglier, less usable, and harder to 
navigate than ScheduleMan, most 
students seemed to not mind using 
it for things like course audits and 
grade checking. 
That was until this semester, 
when the school announced that 
students would be registering 
through SIO rather than the usual 
Online Registration (OLR)  which 
was about as horribly put together 
as a non-Geocities website can get. 
We werent thrilled, but we dealt 
with it because the service was, at 
that point, at least functional, if not 
spectacular.
But with each slip like this, its 
becoming clear that the school 
needs to step up its usability game. 
The ScottyLabs initiative and new 
TartanHacks organization are good 
starts to this  making university 
interfaces more open to student 
development (and fostering that 
development) might encourage registration handlers to step up their 
game in the web tech department. 
The university should pursue a 
policy of maintaining clear, usable, 
well-built systems that can be relied on in all situations  services 
that showcase the schools worldrenowned Human-Computer Interaction Institute and computer 
science department rather than 
slapping them in the face with services like SIO, OLR, and other student services. 
To do otherwise is not just burdensome on the student body; its 
settling for adequacy, and that is not 
what Carnegie Mellon is about.

A PERSONS OPINION
Its the end of the spring semester, and for some people, their last at Carnegie Mellon. So we asked,
How do feel about the fact that you are/are not graduating?
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Jennifer Coloma

LETTER TO THE EDITORStudents should voice opinions on JFC budget
(Dont worry Senate, this articles on me.)
I recently sat in on a meeting 
where GSA and CMUs undergraduate Senate were reviewing budget 
appeals that had recently just gone 
through the Joint Funding Committee. Since Ive paid my student 
activities fee, I was glad I got to see 
exactly how all this money is being 
handled.
One thing, however, I was not 
expecting, was such a con?ict over 
The Tartans budget. Essentially, 
The Tartan would like to pay some of 
their staff, just like Activities Board 
Tech and cmuTV do, as incentive to 
write a wider range of articles. The 
majority of Senate did not like this 
idea.
The Tartan was referred to on 
multiple occasions as an organization that could not be compared 
to AB Tech or cmuTV because they 
were a serviceless organization. People in the Senate added that if they 
needed to pay someone to write an 
article, they would need to pay people to read it too, and if the Tartan 
were to fold, nothing would change. 
I was shocked to see a resounding 
majority of Senate agree with this, 
and if it werent for GSA, the money 
would have been removed from the 
budget. (Thank you, GSA!)
I thought I could safely assume 
weve all made it past high school, 
but this leads me to ask, do these 
people not know anything about 
U.S. history? In what world is a 
newspaper a serviceless organization? Last time I checked, a newspapers sole purpose was to service 
its community, much like what the 
Senate should be doing.
I am also forced to wonder, how 
many people are actually reading 
this, and was the Senate right? How 
much importance does Carnegie 
Mellon put on what used to be such 
a signi?cant American institution?
Newspapers play an integral role 
in sharing information and keeping facts before the public. Because 
of this, I am writing to encourage 
whoever is reading this to sit in on 
the next Senate meeting. Its our 
money and its our responsibility to 
make sure we let the Senate know 
just how important this newspaper 
really is.

Retailers insensitivity is appalling
DANIEL COHANPOUR
Retailer Urban Out?tters is receiving backlash from both Jewish 
and non-Jewish groups over a controversial T-shirt design. The shirt, 
yellow in color, includes a six-pointed star embroidered directly over 
the breast pocket. Many have drawn 
connections with the yellow badge 
that was forced upon Jewish people 
during the Nazi regime. The entire 
design prompted connections to the 
Holocaust, especially because it was 
released in the same week as Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The shirt is part of the spring/
summer collection of Danish fashion label Wood Wood, and the design was posted on Urban Out?tters 
website on April 19 for $100. Since 
the posting of the design, organizations such as the Anti-Defamation 
League have voiced their opinion. 
We ?nd this use of symbolism to be 
extremely distasteful and offensive, 
Barry Morrison, regional director of 
the Anti-Defamation League, wrote 
in a letter emailed to President and 
CEO of Urban Out?tters Richard A. 
Hayne, and we are outraged that 
your company would make this product available to your customers.
In a response on Wood Woods 
website, co-founder Brian Jensen 
stated, I assume the image people 
have reacted to comes from Urban 
Out?tters website. This must be a 
photograph of an early prototype. 
The label claimed that after noticing 
that the design resembled the controversial badge, it removed the star 
from the ?nal design. Urban Out?tters also recently removed the image 
of the shirt with the badge on its online store.
Besides the fact that the shirt is 
over-priced (a yellow shirt with a 
pocket is a staggering $100), it is an 
affront to humanity. To say that the 
design posted on the website was 
an earlier form of the ?nal product 
is ridiculous on two counts. First, 
there is no precedent for fashion labels to post initial forms of a design 
on a website. Items on online stores 
are for purchase and are in no way 
meant for tracking a shirt from its 
earlier to ?nal stages.
This statement also brings to 
mind another deep hole in logic. The 
shirt recognizably and undoubtedly 
resembles the Holocaust badge. Any 
layman  including those who have 
little knowledge of Jewish history  
can identify the badge. The notion 
that no one from Urban Out?tters, a 
label that deems itself cultured and 
trendy, identi?ed the design when 
it was presented by Wood Wood is 
impossible to believe. The move was 
derogatory and, in my view, intentional.
Urban Out?tters has built a reputation for scandalous behavior. They 
have insulted many minority groups 
in the past. For St. Patricks Day, 
they sold a T-shirt with Irish I was 
Drunk written in the center. The 
label has also been under ?re from 
Native Americans, who claimed that 
the Navajo line was a highly distressing trademark violation. 
The Wood Wood move was historically and racially insensitive. It 
was either a publicity stunt  an action by the label to build controversy 
in order to boost sales  or an intentionally racist move made by a racist 
fashion label during a racially sensitive week.
In any viewpoint, the shirt cannot 
be labeled as unintentional. Urban 
Out?tters should be both legally and 
?nancially reprimanded. Im pushing for a boycott on their clothes. The 
label wants to push the controversy 
under the rug, having removed the 
badge from the shirt, but no formal 
apology by the company has been 
presented. Until this happens, I urge 
those who shop at Urban Out?tters 
and elsewhere to spread the word.

Digital voting registration could solve many issues
JOSEPH WHITE
Junior Staffwriter
The U.S. system of voting registration is not known for being robust 
or strong. 
On the contrary, it is known for 
being ineffective in registering the 
public at large, as well as inaccurate, costly, and obsolete. More than 
a million deceased are still on the 
voter rolls, and one of every eight 
voter registrations are either invalid or inaccurate. Another problem 
is the ease with which people can 
register in multiple states. Partially 
because of the systems ineptitude, 
over 50 million eligible voters are 
not registered.
A big part of the problem is that 
the system is paper based, which is 
hard to update as voters change districts or move from state to state. Although this does not directly result 
in voter fraud, it does increase the 
systems susceptibility.
The second problem with our 
system is the cost. It costs 12 times 
more to register a single voter in the 
U.S. than it does in Canada. Much 
of this cost is borne by state and 
local government budgets, money 
that could easily be better spent 
elsewhere. 
The Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project estimated that one 
third of county and local election of?ces budgets is spent on voter registration alone.
This paper based system is also 
the biggest cause of inef?ciency in 
our voting system. Computers could 
easily compare data of voting registrations between states to reduce 
the number of double registrations 
and registered deceased, which 
would make fraud much more dif?cult to execute.
A third issue is the sheer number 
of registrations that all come into 
the system in a short, concentrated 
period before election day. Recording all this new data through paper 
registration in a timely manner invites human error because all of it 
must be entered manually. This also 
results in people not being entered 
into the rolls in time, meaning many 
ballots that should be legitimate are 
thrown out.
I was affected by this, discovering this past Tuesday that my registration was botched, rendering 
me unable to vote in the primaries. 
This ample room for error affects 
our elections and affects the people 
who get elected and the type of government we have. Elections are supposed to demonstrate the will of the 
people, and our current system fails 
miserably.
To ?x this system, data-matching 
methods should be implemented 
to catch multiple registrations and 
inaccuracies in the voter rolls. The 
process of registration must also be 
made cheaper by enabling Americans to register online, minimizing manual data entry by making 
the system electronic. It is time for 
our voting system to enter the 21st 
century.
Romney must focus on economy
KYLE HENSON
Although hes almost reluctantly 
accepted by the Republican base, 
Mitt Romney has emerged from a 
grueling primary season as a better, 
more de?ned candidate for President 
of the United States. Now that Romney is poised to run against President 
Barack Obama on Nov. 6, what must 
he do to win?
First off, Romney needs to de?ne 
himself as a clear contrast to Obama 
 in means, not ends. Obama is incredibly popular because he can articulate his goals well and sell them 
to the populace, but he tends to 
achieve those goals in the absolute 
worst ways possible.
If Obama says the capital gains 
tax rate is too low, then Romney 
should raise that rate to 20 percent, 
but lower the corporate tax rate to 15 
percent. 
Romney should also eliminate the 
loopholes that allow General Electric to pay less than 5 percent of its 
income in taxes while less powerful 
companies pay close to the full 35 
percent rate.
If healthcare reform is needed, 
Romneycare (which Romney himself 
has not renounced) should be embraced as a state solution to a state 
problem in order to get the federal 
government out of state efforts to 
solve their own healthcare problems.
Secondly, Romney needs to demonstrate exactly how these pro-freedom means will better achieve the 
ends that the American people want, 
such as economic security and lower 
unemployment. Romneys strengths 
are that he comes from a business 
background and can solve the economic issues that have been plaguing the nation. 
Instead of ?inging personal attacks back and forth, Romney should 
stick to the issues and Obamas record, and demonstrate why he is the 
best candidate to get the economy on 
track.
Third, Romney should pledge 
to not touch any social issues. This 
election isnt about abortion and its 
not about gay marriage; its about 
the economy. That is Romneys main 
appeal. 
Hes the CEO who can get U.S.A. 
Corp. out of Chapter 11 and into the 
prosperity that Americans used to 
enjoy. If Romney does this, hell win 
over moderate voters who dont like 
traditional Republican views on social issues, but desperately want a 
better economy.
Lastly, Romney needs to pick a 
solid running mate and commit himself to making tough choices now to 
prevent tougher choices later. 
Social Security is going to run out 
of money 33 years from now. The 
Bush tax cuts and Obamas payroll 
tax cut are set to expire on the same 
day; Medicare and Medicaid are 
driving up the de?cit tremendously.
There are people in the GOP who 
are working to tackle these issues in 
ways that resonate with conservatives and moderates. These are also 
some of the people that the GOP 
base wanted to be their nominee in 
the ?rst place, people Romney has 
been hanging out with recently, notably Wisconsin Representative Paul 
Ryan and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. These people can help Romney 
de?ne his platform and win in 2012.
Romney isnt an empty candidate. 
Hes emerged for the better from a 
grueling primary season and, if he 
plays his cards right, can sit in the 
Oval Of?ce in 2013.

SPORTS COMMENTARYFirst-round NBA Playoff predictions feature no upsets
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
And then there were 16. 
The 2012 NBA Playoffs, after 
the shortened regular season 
which seemed to dash to the 
?nish line, are now here. Since 
each team needs 16 wins to receive an NBA title, the playoffs 
feel like a whole new season. 
The long journey to the precipice of the best league in the 
world began last Saturday. But 
lets talk ?rst-round predictions. Im sorry to inform you, 
but I dont see any upsets happening in the ?rst round.
Eastern Conference:
No. 1 Chicago Bulls vs. 
No. 8 Philadelphia 76ers
This may be the hardest 
match-up to predict. Since 
the Bulls point guard Derrick 
Rose tore his left ACL with 
just 1:10 left in the ?rst victory over the 76ers, this ?rstseed vs. eighth-seed battle 
could be closer than initially 
thought. However, the Bulls 
have played with Rose injured 
throughout the season, going 
179 with the reigning MVP 
on the pine. The 76ers, who 
got off to a hot start and on 
pace to win the Atlantic Division in the East, limped to 
the ?nish line and fell to the 
eighth seed. The team is led 
by shooting guard Andre Iguodala and has explosive play off 
the bench from point guard 
Lou Williams and small forward Thaddeus Young. This is 
a must-watch series that will 
go deep, but I give the Bulls 
the advantage: Bulls in seven.
No. 4 Boston Celtics vs. 
No. 5 Atlanta Hawks
The Celtics looked like an 
ancient artifact from when 
they won the championship 
in 2008. But the team played 
stellar basketball post All-Star 
Game, with shooting guard 
Ray Allen coming off the 
bench, although head coach 
Doc Rivers says he is 50/50 
for the start of the playoffs. 
The Hawks come into the playoffs with the same team it has 
taken to the playoffs the last 
four years, led by small forward Joe Johnson and power 
forward Josh Smith. Well, the 
same except for All-Star center Al Horford. However, the 
Hawks have a knack for losing 
to experienced teams in the 
playoffs: Celtics in seven.
No. 3 Indiana Pacers vs. 
No. 6 Orlando Magic
The Pacers are my dark 
horse team to win the East. It 
is the deepest team in the conference, with six players averaging double ?gures in points 
and eight players averaging 
more than nine points per 
game. With the Magics center Dwight Howard out with a 
back injury, Pacers center Roy 
Hibbert may be the best center 
in the Eastern Conference. He 
has led the Pacers rebound 
to fourth in the league. Head 
coach Frank Vogel has made 
a great case for Coach of the 
Year and has his team in great 
shape heading into the ?rst 
round. The Magic is heavily dependent on the defense 
Howard brings to the table. 
Without him, I dont think the 
Magic can do much damage: 
Pacers in ?ve. 
No. 2 Miami Heat vs.     
No. 7 New York Knicks
If the ?rst game was any 
indication, the Heat should 
handle this series. Most expect 
the Heat to dominate this entire conference, as it is without Rose and Howard. But the 
matchup between Heats small 
forward Lebron James and 
Knicks small forward Carmelo Anthony is intriguing. Fantasy nerds will relish this: The 
?rst playoff matchup between 
these two superstars of the 
2003 draft class. Forget about 
all the other superstars in this 
series, it is all about James and 
Anthony going head-to-head. 
But in the end, this series 
wont be close and the Heat 
will dominate just as people 
expect: Heat in ?ve. 
Western Conference:
No. 1 San Antonio Spurs 
vs. No. 8 Utah Jazz
Although the Jazz is reputable for the scrappy, tough, and 
sometimes overly-aggressive 
play typical of playoff-style 
basketball, this series will be 
all Spurs. The Spurs, who typically wear other teams down 
with its defense, have made it 
to the top of the Western Conference with its offense, led 
by point guard Tony Parker. 
Despite losing in last years 
?rst round to the eighth-seed 
Memphis Grizzlies, Spurs 
coach Gregg Popovich wont 
let that happen again. Spurs 
power forward Tim Duncan 
will go for his ?fth title, and 
the Jazz will have no answer 
for this team: Spurs in four.
No. 4 Memphis Grizzlies 
vs. No. 5 Los Angeles Clippers
It is no surprise that the 
fourth-seed vs. ?fth-seed 
match-up is the most compelling. The Clippers were 
the center of media attention 
when the team brought in AllStar point guard Chris Paul; 
the Clippers claimed the nickname Lob City from Pauls 
exceptional passing combined 
with power forward Blake 
Grif?ns insane hops. When 
guard Chauncey Billups went 
down with an Achilles tear on 
Feb. 8, the Clippers seemed 
to be struggling. But if Grif?n 
can learn to play through the 
hard fouls he seems to always 
attract, the team can win this 
series. However, I like the 
Grizzlies in this series. The 
Grizzlies are the Pacers of the 
Western Conference, as they 
also have six players averaging 
double-digit points per game. 
Led by Rudy Gay, I think the 
depth of the Grizzlies will be 
too much for the Clippers mediocre defense: Grizzlies in 
seven.
No. 3 Los Angeles Lakers 
vs. No. 6 Denver Nuggets
Lakers shooting guard 
Kobe Bryant begins his journey alongside power forward 
Pau Gasol in search of his sixth 
NBA Championship. After another great season by Bryant, 
the Lakers look poised to make 
a deep run in the playoffs. 
Bryant is well rested, sitting 
out eight of the Lakers last 10 
games, which will be key to 
winning a playoff series. Additionally, taking advantage 
of the size and skill Gasol and 
center Andrew Bynum bring 
to the table will almost certainly secure a ?rst round series win. But sometimes the 
Lakers shy away from that 
game plan, and the Nuggets 
can do some serious damage 
with their run-and-gun style. 
The Nuggets led the NBA 
in scoring, averaging 104.1 
points per game. The teams 
speed and depth could cause 
the older and slower Lakers a 
lot of trouble. However, on the 
back of Bryant, I dont see the 
experienced Lakers falling in 
the ?rst round: Lakers in six.
No. 2 Oklahoma City 
Thunder vs. No. 7 Dallas 
Mavericks
The reigning three-time 
scoring champion small forward Kevin Durant and point 
guard Russell Westbrook may 
be the best perimeter player 
combination in the Western 
Conference. But after last 
years playoffs, I cannot immediately count out power 
forward Dirk Nowitzkis Mavericks. His ability to catch 
?re and rain threes is a serious concern for the Thunder, 
which doesnt have a matchup 
for him. But the Mavericks 
cant match up with Westbrook at point guard. This 
series will be close, and even 
though the Mavericks are superior decision makers in the 
fourth quarter, the reigning 
champs will be out in round 
one: Thunder in six.
Ian Bangor shoots  one for the books
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
Sophomore Ian Bangor 
was the winner of the Tartans Spring Invitational last 
Thursday, shooting a oneover-par 71 at the Longue Vue 
Club. This win is Bangors 
sixth, becoming the Carnegie 
Mellon all-time wins leader. 
Since Bangor has a few years 
at Carnegie Mellon, there are 
still plenty of chances left for 
him to add to that total.
Ian [Bangor] has been a 
terri?c contribution to this 
golf team. I can see him stepping up and taking control of 
this team, said sophomore 
teammate Matt Wilson.
The golf team ?nished second at the event, scoring 309 
behind California University of Pennsylvania, which 
scored a team round of 294. 
The Tartans had ?ve competitors in the ?eld. Washington 
and Jefferson University, St. 
Vincent College, and Grove 
City College also competed at 
the invitational.
Seniors Terence Einhorn 
and Michael Cheng scored 
rounds of 75 and 80, respectively. This was the last round 
of their college careers. Einhorn placed ?fth in the event 
with his round of 75.
First-year Cameron Low 
scored a round of 83 and 
sophomore Grant Strimel 
was close behind with 85.
The Tartans had an additional six golfers compete individually in the event. Firstyear Justin Fischler led that 
group with a round of 80. 
Sophomore Alex Fry carded 
an 82. First-year Derek Cobb 
and Wilson stroked an 83 and 
an 86, respectively.
The last two competitors 
were junior Jisoo Park and 
?rst-year Austin Cheng; Park 
scored 88 and Cheng shot a 
91.
I was disappointed with 
the team results at the end 
of the season, but we learned 
a lot, Einhorn said. Hopefully, the experiences gained 
through struggle will be paramount in times of success.
This invitational concluded the Tartans 201112 golf 
season. Practices will begin 
again in the fall of 2012.

The Carnegie Mellon 
mens track and ?eld team 
?nished out its season at the 
Dave Labor and Ed Fry Invitational meets on April 14 and 
21, respectively.
At both meets, the athletes 
worked to improve their performances in preparation for 
the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship 
meet, hosted by Carnegie 
Mellon this past weekend.
At the Dave Labor Invitational, hosted by Slippery 
Rock University, the men 
recorded three ?rst-place 
?nishes. First-year Thomas 
Vandenberg and sophomore 
Mike Standish competed in 
the 800-meter run, with Vandenberg coming in ?rst with 
a time of 1:55.64.
The freshman talent on 
the team this year is amazing. 
Theyve had some great performances so far this season, 
Standish said.
The second victory was 
by another new face on the 
team, ?rst-year Elliot Watson, 
who won the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase in 10:19.62. Senior Ryan Kissell carried the 
Tartans to its third ?rst-place 
?nish of the day in the long 
jump, with a mark of 6.23 
meters. Kissell also placed 
second in the triple jump, 
with a distance of 12.59 meters.
The following weekend 
at the Ed Fry Invitational,

This weekend, the No. 
4-ranked Carnegie Mellon 
womens tennis team competed in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Championship at Sanlando Park in Altamonte Springs, Fla.
On Friday, the Tartans took 
on the Case Western Reserve 
University Spartans in the 
quarter?nals. On the back of a 
commanding doubles sweep, 
the Tartans went on to win 
72.
At No. 2 doubles, ?rstyears Chelsea Motie and Byrn 
Raschke won 82, while sophomore Katie Cecil and senior 
Cze-Ja Tam at No. 3 swept 
their match as well. Seniors 
Laura Chen and Courtney 
Chin at No. 1 doubles had a 
slightly tougher time, needing 
a tiebreaker to beat their competition 98 (74).
In singles play, Chen at No. 
2 and Motie at No. 3 both put 
up dominating performances; 
they won in straight sets 62, 
60 and 60, 62, respectively. Cecil was unstoppable, 
not losing a game in her 60, 
60 sweep at No. 1 singles. 
First-year Clare Dubrin at No. 
6 singles had the next Tartan 
victory of the day, winning 
after a tie-break third set 16, 
60, 10 (105).
On Saturday, the Tartans 
took on No. 6-ranked University of Chicago in the UAA 
semi?nals.
The team could not carry 
its momentum over from Friday, and mostly looked tired 
falling 81.
The Tartans lone win came 
from Cecil at No. 1 singles, 
who won her hard-fought 
match 46, 60, 10 (103).
The womens tennis team 
played again on Sunday to 
battle for the third place spot 
in the UAA Championships. 
They faced the No. 11-ranked 
Washington University, and 
ultimately lost 54.
The Tartans had a slow 
start in the matches, going 
down 21. The only win for 
the Tartans was from the No. 
3 doubles team of Cecil and 
Tam, with a score of 81.
The Tartans tried to battle 
back in singles with wins at 
No. 4 and No. 5 singles 62, 
64 by Chin and ?rst-year Angela Pratt, respectively.
The fourth win came from 
Chen with a 67 (57), 60, 
62 victory at No. 2 singles.
The team now awaits its 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association regional assignments. The Tartans hope to 
host regionals as well.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Steelers draft picks
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
Americas obsession with 
the NFL cannot be quenched. 
Even the NFL draft, the yearly 
selection of college football 
juniors and seniors by NFL 
teams, has become a threeday primetime event. Its an 
easy example of our cultures 
football overload, but the 
draft is also a key time for 
teams to rebuild for their future.
When a team is as old 
and injury prone as the Pittsburgh Steelers, it is critical to 
?nd young, healthy, and productive players in all rounds 
of the draft. How well a team 
executes this goal can be the 
difference between creating a dynasty and becoming 
the leagues laughing stock. 
While its impossible to know 
if a player will reach his full 
potential, coaches and managers can still break down 
each player and evaluate him 
on what they believe players 
careers could and should become.
The Steelers came into the 
draft needing to ?ll four big 
holes in its roster: offensive 
guard, offensive tackle, linebacker, and defensive lineman. In the ?rst four rounds 
of the draft, the Steelers went 
right down this list, picking 
the best possible players.
With their ?rst pick, the 
Steelers selected offensive 
guard David DeCastro out of 
Stanford University.
The Steelers had a lot of 
trouble last year trying to 
?eld a healthy offensive line, 
resulting in quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger getting injured. DeCastro, who is regarded as the top guard in the 
draft, should be a starter in 
the beginning of the season 
to provide the interior protection on the line that Big Ben 
was missing last season.
In the second round, the 
Steelers took troubled offensive tackle Mike Adams out of 
Ohio State University. Adams 
was considered to be ?rstround talent until he failed a 
drug test, testing positive for 
marijuana. 
Steelers managers have 
several contract stipulations 
in place to ensure he cleans 
up his act and to protect the 
team if he does not. Adams, 
regardless of his personal 
issues, is a fantastic player. 
With him, DeCastro, and 
third-year center Maurkice 
Pouncey, the Steelers have 
the young core of an offensive team that could protect 
Roethlisberger for years to 
come.
With their third-round 
pick, the Steelers took linebacker Sean Spence from 
the University of Miami in 
order to ?ll the hole created 
by cutting linebacker James 
Farrior. Spence is a versatile 
linebacker who can play outside and inside linebacker, 
in addition to having a quick 
?rst step.
The main reason Spence 
fell in the draft is the concern 
about his size, only measuring 5'11". The Steelers have  
historically been able to maximize the play from its undersized linebackers with star 
linebacker James Harrison, 
who only measures 6 feet.
In the fourth round, the 
Steelers hopefully found nose 
tackle Casey Hamptons eventual replacement in defensive 
tackle Alameda Taamu from 
the University of Washington. Taamu is a big guy who 
routinely took on double 
teams in college and won. 
He has some trouble defending the pass, given his lack of 
speed, but he can completely 
shut down the running game. 
Hopefully, Taamu will develop under Hamptons tutelage 
and take over if Hampton gets 
injured or eventually retires.
The Steelers spent the rest 
of the draft creating depth 
and ?nding a couple of players who could contribute in 
small niche roles next season. 
In the ?fth round, the Steelers took running back Chris 
Rainey from the University of 
Florida to switch things up in 
the back?eld.
In the seventh round, the 
Steelers had four picks. First 
they selected wide receiver 
Toney Clemons out of the 
University of Colorado Boulder to eventually become a 
middle receiver. Next was 
tight end David Paulson from 
the University of Oregon. 
Paulson is expected to compete for the backup job behind starting tight end Heath 
Miller. 
Finally, the Steelers took 
players from the state of Texas. They took cornerback Terrence Frederick from Texas 
A&M University and offensive tackle Kelvin Beachum 
from Southern Methodist 
University; both Frederick 
and Beachum are expected to 
compete for backup roles at 
their respective positions.
Overall, the Steelers did 
not move up but stayed put 
and selected a group of players who can come in and contribute to the team from day 
one.
This draft class has the 
opportunity to become the 
foundation for the future, 
as well as help the Steelers 
make another deep playoff 
push in the upcoming 2012 
NFL season.
Mens tennis takes home fourth place
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis team travelled down to 
Altamonte Springs, Fla., to 
compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships. This is the ?rst year 
that the mens and womens 
UAAs have been hosted at this 
venue.
The No. 13-ranked Tartans 
had a slow start on Thursday 
morning, facing New York 
University. The men took the 
lead 21 after doubles. Wins 
came from the No. 2 team of 
junior Jooho Yu and ?rst-year 
Thomas Cooper 84, and the 
No 3. ?rst-year duo of Christian Heaney-Secord and Bryce 
Beisswanger 83. The Tartans 
No. 1 team of junior Duke 
Miller and ?rst-year William 
Duncan lost in a tiebreaker 
98 (73).
In singles play, the matches were even tighter. Cooper 
was the ?rst win for the Tartans at No. 5 with scores of 
60, 61. The next singles victory was from Miller at No. 1, 
winning his three set battle 
76 (71), 36, 61. With the 
match tied at 44, Yu was the 
only player left to compete. Yu 
won the match for the Tartans 
57, 63, 61, helping move 
Carnegie Mellon on to the 
semi?nals.
In the semi?nals, the Tartans faced the No. 17-ranked 
Washington University in St. 
Louis. The Tartans lost this 
match in a closely competed 
game, 54.
The Tartans jumped out of 
the gates, leading 30 after 
doubles. Duncan and Miller 
won at No. 1 doubles, 84. 
The No. 2 doubles tandem of 
Cooper and Yu were next off 
the court with an 84 victory. 
Rounding out the doubles 
was the Tartans No. 3 team 
of Beisswanger and HeaneySecord, with a tiebreaker win 
98 (108).
However, the Tartans 
struggled in singles play. Cooper was the only Tartan to pull 
out a win at No. 5 singles, with 
a score of 63, 62.
In the third place match, 
the Tartans faced Case Western Reserve University. The 
Tartans took home the fourth 
place trophy with a 63 loss to 
Case Western.
It was a tough loss. I feel 
mostly for our captain. We 
really wanted to give him a 
chance to come out and compete at NCAAs, Heaney-Secord said.
The Tartans took a 21 
lead after doubles with a win 
from the No. 2 team of Cooper and Yu by a score of 86. 
The other doubles point came 
from the tiebreaker victory by 
the No. 1 team of Duncan and 
Miller, winning 98 (74).
Again, the Tartans were 
only able to win one other 
match. Duncan won at No. 3 
singles 63, 64.
The guys battled hard like 
they have all season. We had 
the best doubles in the tournament and the losses werent 
due to lack of heart. Thomas 
Cooper was a beast, said volunteer assistant coach Jonathan Spero.

After ?nishing 51 in the 
University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships, 
?rst-year Thomas Cooper of 
the Carnegie Mellon mens 
tennis team was able to spare 
a few moments to talk about 
his career as a college athlete.
The Tartan: What is your 
major?
Thomas Cooper: One of 
my most popular nicknames is 
Teppy T, short for Tepper Tom. 
Nuff said.
T: What are you looking to 
do in the future?
C: I hope to grow up into a 
responsible and mature adult 
who makes a positive difference in the lives of others. I 
also hope to help establish 
world peace throughout the 
four corners of the globe. You 
know, the whole make love, 
not war thing.
T: What do you enjoy most 
about the tennis team?
C: Several of the things I 
enjoy most about the tennis 
team include team trips, intrateam camaraderie, getting a 
toned and tan body, and most 
of all, spending time with the 
wonderful Lady Tarts  our 
girls team.
T: What has been your 
proudest moment?
C: My proudest moment on 
the team was seeing Big Chris 
[?rst-year Christian HeaneySecord] grow up before my 
eyes during the North Carolina Weslyan match. I felt like 
a mother bird watching her 
chick spread its wings for the 
?rst time as he gutted out an 
intense three-set match to propel us to victory.
T: What are your goals for 
next season?
C: We want to bring a National Championship to the 
Burgh. First and foremost, we 
would like to compete within 
the school for the highest GPA 
of any team. This is a top priority for my fellow mathletes, 
like myself.
T: What has been your funniest moment on the team?
C: One of the funniest moments of my season was trying 
to wake up Julian Pearlman 
on spring break. The poor kid 
needed a Red Bull so bad, all 
he could do was lay in his cot 
and groan until team captain 
Jeremy The Asian Invasion 
King pounced on him, pummeling him with pillows and 
forcing him out of his slothlike attitude.
T: What is your favorite 
food to pig out on with the 
team?
C: As a team, we take great 
pride to eat to compete. Myself and the other freshmen 
have a tradition of going to 
Schatz one night a week after 
practice. This particular night 
of the week is often the most 
dreaded weekly endeavor for 
all parties involved. I suppose 
the reason we continue to go 
can best be summed up by 
a wise Carnegie Mellon tennis alumni, who asked to remain anonymous upon social 
grounds. He said, The Schatz 
train only has one stop, and 
once youre on that train, you 
gotta take it all the way to the 
end of the line. That end of the 
line is the cemetery.
T: What do you like to do 
on road trips?
C: We really enjoy quiet 
conversations and getting to 
know each other on a more 
intimate level. There exists a 
heated rivalry among the team 
in the game Catch Phrase. Personally, I also really enjoy instigating arguments with ol 
Bill Duncan [?rst-year William 
Duncan]. It is fun to push his 
buttons and get him all riled 
up, only to bring him down 
to my level of intelligence and 
beat him with experience.
T: What do you ?nd most 
rewarding about being a Carnegie Mellon athlete?
C: I love the varsity weight 
room. I often ?nd the amount 
of weight in the public gyms is 
simply not enough. I am also 
?attered by the recognition 
and popularity that being a 
tennis player brings. The sheer 
amount of spectators that 
come to watch us play really 
validates all the hard work we 
put in.

The truth and lies in ?lm
Installation attempts to critique documentary ?lmmaking
This Friday marked the opening of Duncan 
Campbells exhibit as the 68th installment of the 
Carnegie Museums Forum series. The Irish artist 
creates video portraits of somewhat obscure 
figures in history using archival material and original 
footage. The exhibition, titled Duncan Campbell, 
displays three of his recent pieces  Bernadette, 
Make it New John, and Arbeit  which play 
sequentially on a timed rotation three times each 
day.
Upon entering, viewers eyes are tickled with the 
sudden sensation of darkness and an electricity in 
the air. There are four comfortable leather couches 
facing a large screen, an environment that tempts 
even the most avid and alert art viewer to sleep. 
This movie theater atmosphere sets the expectation 
for an exciting, flashy Hollywood show. The actual 
pieces, however, are quite different from most film 
experiences.
Make it New John, the most impressive of the three 
films, paints a portrait of the DMC-12 sports car 
produced by the DeLorean Motor Company in West 
Belfast, Ireland, and its creator John DeLorean. The 
vehicle, best known for its appearance in Back to the 
Future, is the star of the strange, fragmented film.
The piece begins with found footage representative 
of DeLoreans troubled childhood and successful 
adolescence as a creator. However, without 
reading the pamphlets available at the door, this 
message is extremely difficult to understand when 
watching the film. The clips seem disoriented and 
strange, which is not helped by the abstract and 
disconnected audio, which at one point features the 
strange repeating whooping of a man for at least two 
minutes.
The film features both black and white and color 
clips, but all have the appearance of being aged. The 
found footage of the beginning slowly transitions 
into archival material detailing the rise and fall of 
DeLorean, his factory, and the factory workers. The 
film is a documentary in style, but has a slightly 
off feeling to it; instead of looking at a final project, 
the viewer flips through endless news channels all 
discussing the same topic. The end of the film is 
a scripted conversation between factory workers 
based on archival documents, images, and an 
unscripted conversation. However, the scene drags 
on for over 10 minutes.
The piece has redeeming qualities: The juxtaposition 
of the found film clips is fascinating and the largely 
forgotten story that is being told is intriguing. 
The one thing I did like about it was the 
instantaneous scene changes, said first-year 
linguistics and French double major Edward 
Wojciechowski III. But it was confusing a lot of the 
time.
In fact, many viewers did not manage to sit through 
the entire 50-minute film, and did not stay for the 
other two films.
Campbells exhibit critiques the world of 
documentary film, an art privileged with being 
labeled as the truth. By involving his own 
hand so much in recounting his perspective of 
events with staged reenactments and distortion 
of time, Campbell twists the notion of truthful 
documentation. He walks a fine line between 
documentation and artistic liberty. While his 
intentions are thought-provoking, his work seems to 
have less of a spark by itself.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I have a girlfriend and 
its been going great. But 
whenever shes feeling 
glum, shell send me a 
text asking me to cheer 
her up. I try my best, 
sending messages like, 
The sun will expand into 
a red giant in 5 billion 
years and consume the 
Earth. But she just gets 
angry at these texts. Am I 
doing something wrong?
Thanks,
Tirelessly, Enthusiastically 
Xchanging Tender, 
Uplifiting Anecdotes, 
Lover Hates Epistles And 
Letters, I Need Guidance
Dear TEXTUAL HEALING,
Frankly, I dont know why 
those texts wouldnt cheer 
her up. Nothing makes me 
appreciate my life more than 
daily reminders of the futility 
of the human endeavor. But 
I guess your girlfriend is a 
different sort of bird. She 
probably wanted something 
more along the lines of, I 
cant wait to see you tonight 
or, Heres a puppy in a 
bow tie. If shes like this, I 
recommend stocking up on 
cute animal pictures.
If that doesnt work, then 
we know the problem: Shes 
clearly a robot, and her 
depression is caused by her 
lack of a soul and confusion 
about her place in the 
universe. You just need to let 
her compute through it and 
shell either get out of her 
funk or destroy humanity.
Or reprogram her to love 
puppies in bow ties,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I was selected to be an 
OC next year, and Im 
really looking forward to 
guiding all those firstyears through their first 
couple weeks here. Its 
my first time, and I want 
to make sure I do a good 
job. Do you have any tips 
for being an OC?
Thanks,
Desperate to 
Inspire Students, 
Organize Residents; I 
Emphatically Need Tips, 
Encouragement, Direction
Dear DISORIENTED,
Being an OC is a great 
honor. You have been 
selected to be enthusiastic 
and wear the same clothes 
for a week (thats pretty 
much the extent of your 
responsibilities). Now you 
need to learn the things you 
cant do.
First, you cant hit on your 
residents. I know, I know, 
thats the main reason you 
became an OC. But youre 
not allowed to do it. You also 
cant drink or party with your 
residents  at least during 
Orientation. The one thing 
you really do need to do 
is aggressively recruit your 
residents to join whatever 
Greek organization youre a 
part of. Thats technically 
not allowed, but dont let 
that stop you. Follow these 
rules and youre sure to be 
an adequate OC!
Just be sure to start 
ignoring them after 
Orientation,
Patrick Hoskins

Bo Burnham, a 21-year-old comedian and musician, 
performed at the Carnegie Library Music Hall last Friday 
to a crowd of about a thousand. Pittsburgh was the ?rst 
stop on his short, 10-day tour across the country.
The comedian got his start by posting YouTube videos in 
2007. I was sixteen and doing that before anyone knew 
YouTube was a thing, Burnham said. I just started 
writing songs and posting them online so my brother 
could watch them at Cornell. Then one day I had like 
5,000 views.
Since then, Burnhams fame has continued to rise 
with clever, self-aware songs like Love Is and Art Is 
Dead. The song Art Is Dead, for example, discusses 
the conundrum of the artist. When he grows up to be a 
comic or actor/ Hell be rewarded for never maturing/ For 
never understanding or learning/ That every day cant be 
about him... My drugs attention/ I am addict/ But I get 
paid to indulge in my habit.
Burnham has performed twice in Pittsburgh before this 
most recent appearance. Im very happy to be back, 
Burnham said. Ive been living in L.A. since December, 
but Im from Boston and I really miss the East Coast.
Apparently, the East Coast missed him as well. With 
the Carnegie Library Music Hall nearly ?lled to capacity, 
Burnham emerged from behind heavy red stage curtains 
amid raucous applause.
As a recording repeatedly sang, Welcome to the show, 
Burnham danced and ran his hands through a mass 
of dirty blonde hair that seemed to defy gravity with 
its upward pull. Before sitting on a stool placed center 
stage, Burnham ripped off two pairs of red track pants 
and a hoodie to reveal an Urban Out?tters T-shirt and a 
pair of worn blue jeans. The show had begun.
With an old fashioned wrap-around balcony and seating 
reminiscent of a high school theater, the venue provided 
an intimate and comfortable space between the 
audience and the artist.
Burnham used a variety of mediums in this comedic 
performance  including voice-overs, abrupt ends to 
songs, spastic dancing, and dark, pithy quips directed 
at the audience. Much of his humor dwelled on 
adolescence and awkwardness.
Near the beginning of his act, Burnham accidentally 
knocked over his water bottle, and as he clumsily 
apologized, a 10-second song came on. He meant to 
knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all 
thought it was an accident. He meant to knock the water 
over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie, nothing is real.
Tiny bits like this were sprinkled throughout his 
act. Another one that he used several times was a 
microphone transition song, which is exactly what it 
sounds like. Walking between the microphones ... is 
really awkward. After these short bits, Burnham would 
immediately launch into another joke or song, playing on 
a keyboard at a breakneck speed.
Nowadays so much of what I want to do is being 
based off of taking people by surprise and being a little 
bit random, a little all over the place with the content 
jumping around, so that I can be silly the whole time, 
Burnham said. With a mixture of melodramatic acting, 
dancing, stand-up comedy, poem reading, singing, and 
playing the keyboard, Burnham was indeed random and 
diverse in his performance.
Its all the same muscle  writing and performing, 
Burnham said. Muscle confusion, engaging in different 
mediums, is going to make you stronger. I always try to 
confuse myself. 
Although his humor was sharp and clever, the fast-paced 
and random format of his show was slightly confusing. 
Audience members who were familiar with Burnhams 
comedic style took it in stride, but for those who were 
not familiar, it was a bit disconcerting.
Fortunately for Burnham, the majority of the crowd was 
already accustomed to his erraticism. The audience, 
which consisted largely of teenagers (and more than a 
few screechy fangirls), laughed uproariously at his selfdeprecating jokes and his dark humor.
I like taking subjects and ripping them apart, Burnham 
said. Ripping myself apart is easiest because its what 
I know best. So much [of my act] is a re?ection of who I 
am. Or rather, its the way I choose to present myself in 
an hour, a weird version of myself thats not always very 
likable.
Toward the end of the evening, the audience began 
getting even more comfortable with Burnham, 
requesting speci?c songs or asking if he had a girlfriend. 
More than one audience member asked for his hand in 
marriage. One memorable interaction occurred when 
Burnham, who had been describing his experience 
being called the c-word, was then called said word by 
an audience member. Burnham looked the audience 
member coolly in the eye and snappily stated, I didnt 
know this was a role call.
Burnhams 90-minute set ended at 9:30 p.m., but the 
audience wasnt ready to let him go. After continuous 
clapping, Burnham came back out onstage to perform 
his song Nerds. Still, the audience wasnt satis?ed 
until he had come out for a second encore, this time 
ending with a performance of one of his newer songs, 
Oh My God, which details the thoughts of God on 
humanity. After two encores, Burnham managed to 
persuade the crowd to leave, with the promise that he 
would be waiting to meet fans outside.
Even after successful shows like last Fridays, young 
Burnham is still asking himself, What is comedy?
I understand science and what its purpose is, but what 
is the purpose of comedy? Burnham mused. For me, 
its really a matter of being fearless on stage. I have a lot 
of young fans that come out and I would like to be good 
for them in some way, to get up there and show them 
that you can trust your own voice.

entertainment, from singing to stand-up comedy to

On Film Scores
A ?lm score can make or break a movie. Before the advent 
of talkies, most movies completely relied on their scores 
to build suspense, create drama, and serve as an audible 
link from the images on the screen to the viewer; yet 
the rise of talkies saw a seismic shift in emphasis, from 
cinematography and music to acting and the voice.
In recent years, ?lm music has been a lackadaisical affair. 
There is a small group of greats  composers Hans 
Zimmer, Thomas Newman, Howard Shore, and John 
Williams  that are responsible for most Hollywood 
blockbusters. The process has become mechanical: The 
lead composer writes a theme, which is often a small 
alteration from a past ?lm and a group of assistants writes 
the variations. This method can work quite well: The score 
for The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a perfect example. 
But often this results in the same sounds being put into 
multiple ?lms.
Fortunately, there are exceptions to this process. Every 
once in a while, a newcomer will come to the scene and 
create something quite memorable. In 2011s Drive, the 
score featured the ethereal, 80s sounding, synthesizer 
Europop sounds of Cliff Martinez. Apologies to Ryan 
Gosling fans, but the dreamlike score of Drive is de?nitely 
the ?lms strongest element. 
Film music, like any sort of music, is a mixed affair ?lled 
with highs and lows. Perhaps more interesting is how 
the elements of the score permeate into the rest of the 
music world. Most recently, Johnny Jewel, the person who 
everyone thought would score Drive, released the album 
Themes For an Imaginary Film, which, like Drive, featured 
arpeggiating synths, dramatic sweeps, and brittle drum 
machines. The term cinematic music is thrown around 
a lot, but rarely does this term truly imply a cinematic 
experience. The two hours of music contained on Themes 
For an Imaginary Film, however, is able to emulate the 
experience of watching a ?lm. All you have to do is close 
your eyes and be drawn into your imagination.

Van Etten sings with emotion
Singer-songwriter lends husky voice to lecture hall
We went for the music and stayed for the banter.
Flock of Dimes and Sharon Van Etten took the stage 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall last Saturday evening 
as part of the Warhol Museums Spring Sound Series.
Flock of Dimes is a musical project created by Jenn 
Wasner (half of the folk rock duo Wye Oak). She 
played ?rst, backed by a bassist and her producer 
on drum machine. The sprawling set was a clear 
departure from the sparser, cleaner sound that Wye 
Oak has developed.
Wasners vocals were often lost among the sea of 
reverb and guitars, but her strongest work of the 
night included the moments when her voice took 
center stage, as well as certain riffs on her song 
Prison Bride and the chilling, self-described ghost 
story Apparition. Wasner closed with a song she 
wrote after a dream she had of Swedish pop artist 
Robyn. REPLICA was Wasners own effort to clone 
Robyn, during which she sang and danced alone on 
stage.
After a brief stage reset, Van Etten and her band 
began their phenomenal performance. The audience 
was smitten, as Van Etten played the majority of 
her newest album Tramp, which was released in 
February of this year, interspersed with a few older 
tracks.
Before she left the stage, Wasner warned the 
audience that Van Etten would have everyone 
crying in some sort of collective, cathartic viewing 
experience. But the actual show was a mix of 
emotion, with Van Ettens songs ranging from those 
about moving on in life, to being an independent 
woman, to getting out of a relationship and trying 
to quit smoking. Her jokes between songs brought 
some refreshing quirkiness to the set.
At one point she engaged in a conversation with a 
guest who was doing some acrobatics on the ?oor 
between the front row and the stage. Van Etten 
dedicated a song to her and then recounted in detail 
a scene from a Don Hertzfeldt animation (My Spoon 
is Too Big) to maintain the light mood of the show.
Behind Van Etten was a video projection of highly 
manipulated ?lm clips  mirrored re?ections of 
subway trains, dogs chasing a stick through the 
sand, a woman walking through a forest, and a city 
with the camera focused only on a womans feet. 
These were the weakest parts of the show, due to 
some technical stuttering, but Van Etten encouraged 
fans to contribute to her visual quilt by submitting 
video footage of anything they believed to be 
beautiful to her website.
The show revolved around Van Etten  her jokes, 
her extended thanks to all the people who made 
her tour possible, and most of all the growth in her 
songwriting. The sharper edge of her newer tracks 
kept the evening moving. Van Etten and her band 
closed their set with an extended version of Joke or 
a Lie, an expertly layered, moving, and bittersweet 
performance.

The Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre (PICT) is 
currently halfway through its production of In the 
Next Room (or The Vibrator Play), a 2010 Tony Awardnominated play by Sarah Ruhl. The play opened on April 
19 and has started a buzz among those interested in 
Victorian America and the history of womens sexuality.
Last Wednesdays show opened with a short lecture by 
Kristina Straub, a Carnegie Mellon professor of literary 
and cultural studies and associate dean of the Dietrich 
College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Straub began 
by posing one of famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freuds 
questions to the audience: What does a woman want?
She continued by discussing some of the major 
developments in female sexuality  speci?cally focusing 
on Freuds theories  and engaging in a meaningful 
discussion with the audience about such themes. Most 
of the questions asked by audience members after her 
talk were intended to help put the play in historical 
context, and it seemed that many of the attendees 
were pleased to have the opportunity to talk openly 
and be informed about the history of sexuality. Straubs 
extensive knowledge of Freuds theories of sexuality and 
the history of female sexuality was evident throughout 
the discussion, and her presentation was an excellent 
primer for the play that followed.
In the Next Room provides a snapshot of sexuality 
in the Victorian era. At the dawn of electricity, a 
wonderfully pleasing new technology  the vibrator 
 was frequently used by the medical community 
to treat female hysteria, by effectively causing the 
women (or men) to orgasm. At a time when sex was not 
supposed to be enjoyed by women, the treatment was 
unsurprisingly successful.
The show features a number of treatment scenes, as 
one of the major characters, Dr. Givings (played by Brad 
Heberlee), is a doctor who administers such procedures. 
The ?rst few onstage orgasms, believably faked by the 
actors, incited some laughter among audience members 
who, perhaps understandably, felt uncomfortable with 
such a blatant portrayal of the intimate affair.
Although the repeated onstage orgasms were important 
for allowing the audience to overcome the inherent 
awkwardness of watching such scenes, they were 
perhaps a bit overdone. By intermission, it seemed that 
most of the action was in the doctors of?ce and that the 
plot itself had progressed very little.
Despite the slow plot, the characters in the play were 
very well developed. The character of Catherine Givings 
(played by Megan McDermott), in particular, stood out 
as an excellent example of the repressed and confused 
women of the time. As her friendship with Sabrina 
Daldry (played by Melinda Helfrich) grows and Daldry 
becomes increasingly full of life thanks to Dr. Givings 
treatments, Catherines own femininity and happiness 
are dwindling as she is unable to adequately breastfeed her child and engage in sexual relations with her 
husband. McDermott puts on a great performance, 
showing both the bubbly, enthusiastic, wife-of-asuccessful-doctor side of her character as well as her 
deeply repressed side.
Another stand-out performance is put on by Denver 
Milord, a senior acting major at Carnegie Mellon. 
Milord plays Leo Irving, a sexually and creatively driven 
artist who seeks Dr. Givings help. Milords portrayal 
of his character stands out as particularly strong and 
he provides an appealing and humorous presence 
throughout the second half of the play.
Overall, Ruhls well-developed characters make the 
play interesting and informative, and PICTs casting 
ensures the productions success. While the plot is a 
tad slow at times (much like these Victorian womens 
sex lives) and a few of the characters rely too heavily on 
cultural stereotypes, the historical aspect of the play is 
well executed and the show is an amusing snapshot of 
Victorian life.

Chocolate is something we can all relate to, whether 
from the advice of Forrest Gumps mother or memories 
of past Valentines Days. But contrary to its modern form, 
chocolate started out in Latin America as a liquid in its 
early days.
Marcy Norton discussed the origins of chocolate in a 
lecture last Monday in the Giant Eagle Auditorium in 
Baker Hall, as part of the Kim and Eric Giler Lecture in 
the Humanities and the Humanities Scholars Program.
Norton is an associate professor of history at George 
Washington University; a graduate of the University 
of California, Berkeley; and an award-winning author 
of the book Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures: A History 
of Tobacco and Chocolate in the Atlantic World. Her 
lecture, titled A Sensational Drink: Chocolate Before and 
After the Spanish Conquest of Mesoamerica, focused 
on the chocolate side of her work.
She began by explaining the origins of this type 
of chocolate in order to rid any thoughts audience 
members had of candy bars and truf?es. As a liquid, 
chocolate was prepared using ground cacao beans 
and was thick, red in color, and ?avored with vanilla, 
cinnamon, and other spices.
Nortons lecture focused on chocolates place in Latin 
America and its eventual spread to Europe. She 
described accounts of chocolates assumed psychotropic 
qualities that caused reactions similar to drunkenness: 
over-excitement, dancing, and singing. Since chocolate 
was the ?rst stimulant drink to arrive in Europe, Norton 
speculates that these qualities associated with early 
chocolate make sense and that people today are simply 
desensitized to the stimulant.
Much of the lecture was spent discussing the romantic 
implications of the frothy chocolate drink and the 
signi?cance of its foam. Many examples of chocolate 
being poured from high heights  the way to create 
the special foam  show up in artists portrayals of the 
time. Nortons favorite image on the subject involves 
a depiction of heaven, earth, and hell that includes 
chocolate as one of the middle levels, signifying its 
importance in the life of the Aztecs.
Mapping its journey across the Atlantic, Norton 
explained that chocolate began its integration into 
Europe through colonial of?cials, merchants, and 
clergymen. The clergys role in the spread of chocolate 
caused a good bit of uproar in Europe      sparking a 
debate on whether chocolate could be consumed during 
times of fasting  and in?uenced a sub-genre of poetry 
comparing chocolate to the Eucharist and other religious 
symbols.
Tim Haggerty, a professor in Carnegie Mellons 
department of history, described the lecture as not 
merely a discussion of chocolate, but as using the study 
of chocolate as a vehicle to discussing culture. Nortons 
lecture involved both of these broader topics and served 
as an in-depth example of work in that ?eld.

In the middle of a raging winter storm, two cowboys, 
a pedophilic professor, and a saucy showgirl get off a 
stranded bus, forced to stay the night in a small Kansas 
diner.
Thus begins the School of Dramas production of Bus 
Stop, a play written in 1955 that tells the story of a few 
eccentric people in an enclosed space who cross paths 
and are ultimately forced to evaluate their own identities 
in the process. Bus Stop, which opened last Thursday, is 
a rich adaptation of a thoughtful play, brought to life by 
the acting of skilled drama students.
The set for the production is eerie. The ghostly skeleton 
of a bus-like structure dominates the stage; whole 
chunks of the shell of the bus have apparently cracked 
off, leaving only the bus metal ribcage visible in places. 
The unsettling sight of the ghost-bus, surrounded by 
tufts of withered brown reeds and covered with a ?ne 
layer of snow, creates a chilling and mysterious mood. 
As the audiences ?rst exposure to the play, the set 
captures viewers attention as they wait for the actors to 
appear onstage.
As the characters stumble off the bus and into the 
diner, it becomes clear that each embodies a speci?c 
and familiar stereotype: The nave high school girl, the 
laconic sheriff, and the egotistical professor, to name 
a few. But over the course of the play, many of these 
stereotypes are stripped away as they prove to be no 
more than super?cial labels.
Only skilled actors could have successfully portrayed the 
depth of these characters; eight talented drama students 
rose to the challenge. Senior acting major Annie Heise 
stands out in her sophisticated performance of Cherie, 
an impatient blonde-wigged showgirl who demands 
protection from the infatuated but violent cowboy who 
coerced her onto the bus.
Although the Cherie we ?rst meet is indignant and 
cynical, Heises performance allows the audience to 
watch this steely character slowly thaw and melt. 
Over the course of the play, Cherie sheds her hardened 
exterior and reveals a sensitive and hopelessly romantic 
girl underneath.
Senior acting major Adrian Blake Enscoe depicts a 
similar progression in his character Bo Decker, Cheries 
mean and rough abductor. Despite Bos initially violent 
treatment of Cherie, the audience soon learns that 
underneath this exterior lies a socially clueless and lovestruck boy  a much more pitiable character than the 
angry cowboy who ?rst saunters onstage. Enscoe shows 
his versatility as an actor in his ability to portray the 
rude, aggressive cowboy as well as the more innocent 
side of his character.
Heise and Enscoes performances are not alone in their 
excellent portrayals of complex characters. Each of the 
characters adds personality to the play, making the 
group of strangers in the diner eclectic and dynamic.
Romance and dysfunctional chemistry erupt between 
a few of the characters: Jessie Ryan, a masters student 
in musical theater, plays Elma Duckworth, a cheerful 
but nave girl who catches the eye of the pretentious Dr. 
Lyman (played by senior acting major Alex Rice), a proud 
intellectual and pedophile who is trying to escape the 
state. Meanwhile, the sarcastic and sultry diner owner, 
Grace (played by senior acting major Lexi Soha), has 
a passionate ?ing with the bus driver, Carl (played by 
junior acting major Marquis Wood).
Other, less spirited characters serve to keep the 
peace and bring their more passionate companions 
back down to reason. The gruff and terse sheriff, Will 
Masters (played by senior acting major Patrick de 
Ledebur) strives to maintain order when unrest breaks 
out. Likewise, Virgil Blessing (played by senior acting 
major Michael Cusimano), Bos more level-headed 
and romantically savvy friend, coaxes Bo out of his 
aggressive exterior and serenades the others with his 
sweet harmonica playing.
Together, the characters create a vibrant and somewhat 
dysfunctional dynamic that keeps the audience amused 
and interested, despite the relative lack of plot or change 
in setting. In such a character-driven play, a minimal 
plot is to be expected; but the few plot developments 
that exist in Bus Stop tend to miss the mark. Toward 
the end of the play, when the weather clears and the 
play must resolve itself before the characters go their 
separate ways, a series of events happens all at once. 
Some resolutions are unrealistically quick, while other 
moments drag on. The plays original playwright, William 
Inge, certainly knew how to craft rich and compelling 
characters, but this confusing and strangely paced 
resolution is a somewhat disappointing end to an 
otherwise excellent play.
With such a minimal play in terms of plot, the 
productions success depends largely on the characters 
and the skill of the actors who play them. In this respect, 
the School of Dramas performance of Bus Stop is very 
successful.

We talk about the sci-? notions of robots in society, but, 
you know, its already happening. You just may not see 
it.
Dan Wilcox, a Master of Fine Arts student and co-curator 
and co-host of last Fridays Cyborg Cabaret, hoped to 
expose the crowd at the New Hazlett Theater to the 
growing relationship between humans and robots in 
society.
Its really surprising, the breadth and depth of the type 
of robots that are not science ?ction but that are real life 
and are actually existing, Wilcox said. And we only 
see a little of that. Most people in general might not be 
aware that there are so many crazy things going on.
Cyborg Cabaret: Passion, Terror, & Interdependence 
was a variety show featuring acts ranging from dancing 
robotic arms to a cyborg burlesque show. Performers 
included Golan Levin, director of the STUDIO for 
Creative Inquiry, senior art major Julia Cahill, and Master 
of Fine Arts student Riley Harmon, among others.
The show was hosted by Wilcox, his co-curator Heather 
Knight (a Ph.D. student in robotics), and Data the Robot, 
a social robot created by Knight that has performed in 
many onstage productions. Data charmed the audience 
by telling jokes, introducing an act, and asking questions 
like, Do you ever think about what it all means? This 
life  you know, when the power button is in the on 
position?
Many of the acts in the cabaret were underwhelming 
or confusing, inciting awkward laughter or applause 
from audience members. The cabaret as a whole had a 
distinctively eerie vibe, perhaps due to the natural fear 
that society has toward the role of robots in the future.
Perhaps the most entertaining act was Wilcoxs own 
Robot Rumble. The rumble featured Master of Fine 
Arts students Jonathan Armistead, Carl Bajandas, 
Craig Fahner, Steve Gurysh, and Luke Loef?er wearing 
cardboard costumes of famous robots, including the 
Honda ASIMO, the Carnegie Mellon Crusher, and 
Googles self-driving car. The robots engaged in a WWEstyle ?ght until everyone on stage, including Wilcox, had 
been taken down.
Wilcoxs Robot Rumble was a follow-up to his piece at 
the ?rstand second-year Master of Fine Arts student 
showcase at Bakery Square last month. His inspiration 
for this project was the increasing development of 
human-like robots, and he hoped to entertain audience 
members while simultaneously exposing them to robotic 
technologies they may not have previously known about.
The real point of the whole thing is exposure, he said. 
Its like tricking people into learning about these things 
and being interested in them.
Another act, Harmons Disintegration (after myself), 
was a multimedia piece that examined the delicate 
relationship between people and their technological 
prosthetics, according to the program. The piece 
centered on a video of Harmon in various locations  
on a subway, in a convenience store, at the grocery 
store  and bystanders reactions to his fake prosthetic 
arm malfunctioning. As the video ended, Harmons 
arm sparked and fell off. The act was coherent and 
accessible, while still sending an important message 
about societal notions of technological prosthetics.
Cyborg Cabaret was made possible by funding from the 
2011 Carnegie Mellon School of Art Interdisciplinary 
Award. Wilcox and Knight proposed the idea in April of 
last year and have been collaborating with community 
members and planning the event since. The pair worked 
not only with those participating in the acts, but also 
with community organizations like Assemble, Hack 
Pittsburgh, VIA, and the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry.
It was more about us getting people from outside of 
CMU and from different disciplines ... and getting their 
acts in there, Wilcox said. The whole thing was a 
collaboration.
Wilcox is unsure if Cyborg Cabaret will become an 
annual event, since he will be working on his thesis next 
year. Regardless of whether the event returns again next 
spring, it succeeded in bringing to light questions about 
robotic technology in society and inviting its audience 
to explore and understand the worlds increasing 
dependence on technology.
As Wilcox put it, Its interesting but also a little scary, if 
we want that or not.... We should at least think about it a 
little bit.

Student actors shine in Bus Stop 
Vibrant dynamic of characters makes School of Dramas latest production a success

---------------------------------------------------

Shary Boyles artwork is unquestionably jarring. The 
elaborate visuals she creates possess a quality of 
impressive duality that allow them to be grotesque 
yet divine, dreamlike yet sincere. Boyles work 
communicates fantastic and often dark ideas about 
personal identity and human culture from a feminist 
perspective.
Im always introduced as a Canadian artist, Boyle 
began, speaking to an audience in McConomy 
Auditorium on Tuesday evening. But there is 
blankness to that description. What is the status 
associated with being a Canadian artist?
Through a recent project she calls Canadian Artist, 
Boyle aimed to answer that question. The Toronto 
native fabricated a genealogy to connect a diverse 
group of characters from cultures across the globe. 
She then constructed a physical representation of 
her narrative by creating 45 plaster faces, mounting 
them to a wall in the Bank of Montreal Project Room 
 an exhibition space in Toronto  and using 
colorful ribbon to demonstrate familial relationships. 
At the center of her construction is the face of the 
Canadian Artist.
Boyle explained how she grew up with only a 
vague understanding of her family history and 
that this ambiguity motivates her work. Boyle has 
invented stories of unlikely genealogies. Some of the 
characters in Boyles imaginative project include 
an Ashkenazi Jew who reproduced with a deity, 
a Malinke slave who reproduced with a Seminole 
healer, and a Barnum & Bailey performer who 
reproduced with a juvenile captive.
Artists have no boundaries. We self-invent 
constantly, and so this project was kind of perfect for 
me, she said.
Nicole Anderson, a ?rst-year student in the Bachelor 
of Humanities and Arts program, appreciated 
Boyles artistic imagination. Im really interested, 
in general, in this idea of creating false narratives. 
I like that she invents experiences to communicate 
feelings that real-life experiences dont exist for, 
Anderson said.
Another of Boyles pieces, titled The Clearances, 
explores similar ideas about cultural identity. The 
mural is constructed from colorful cutout drawings 
and depicts a diverse group of people in a mob of 
forward motion that Boyle referred to as the march 
towards progress. The people, drawn wearing 
garments representative of their origins, are also 
accompanied by mythological creatures. Boyle 
described the piece as her attempt to grapple with 
the human impulse to colonize.
Boyle has not con?ned her art to the boundaries of 
a single medium, and works with everything from 
drawing to live projection to porcelain. Works falling 
into the latter category are amazingly intricate, 
many of them involving the tedious construction of 
lace-draped porcelain. Boyle honed her skills under 
the guidance of talented porcelain hobbyists from 
around the world.
I was never one for institutional learning, she said. 
Ive always wanted to be in?uenced by the world 
at large, not a large group, which is why a lot of 
my work doesnt ?t in with contemporary art. I also 
like to see what people outside of the art world are 
doing.
This work outside of the contemporary art world 
gives Boyles art a unique ?air and brings her 
international recognition.
