"I think everyone just assumed we'd
have a three-day weekend."Josh Knauer, Freshman H&SS
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Co-News Editor
Today marks the birthday of 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the 
man who led the fight for equal 
rights for blacks in the 1960s. 
Carnegie Mellon has planned a 
number of activities; however, 
classes are being scheduled as 
usual on this national holiday.
Freshman H&SS student Josh 
Knauer and at least 20 other 
students have said they will 
refuse to attend class today in 
protest of the Universitys policy 
of holding classes on Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. Knauer 
believes the University should 
honor the holiday by calling off 
classes. I think everyone just
assumed wed have a three-day 
weekend, said Knauer. He was 
approached by a number of 
people with concerns that school 
should not be held on Kings 
birthday. Knauer sees it as a 
sign that the University does 
not show respect for Dr. King 
and the ideals he stood for.
According to Knauer, many 
schools across the country are 
marking the holiday by not hold
ing classes. President Ronald 
Reagan declared Martin Luther 
King Jr's birthday a national
holiday, which causes the United 
States Post Office and other gov
ernment agencies to be closed 
tomorrow.
The holidays on which there 
are no classes at CMU are Labor 
Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, 
New Years, Memorial Day, and 
Independance Day.
At least two professors will 
not be holding classes today not 
as a protest, simply as a celebra
tion of the holiday. English pro
fessor Ronald Judy said, Its a

Carnegie Mellon Dining Service alters facilities
By CHRIS MAPLES
Tartan Staffwriter'We will still have to fire tune
Univerns tyCCse nC yCrCc ourp vdawhile, but the initial response is 
extremely favorable."
 Roger Heydt, Assistant dining 
service director
The winds of change blew 
through the Carnegie Mellon Din
ing Service over the winter holi
day, sweeping in surprising and 
expected changes to campus food 
facilities. The alterations repre
sent the result of careful plan
ning, student surveys, and expert 
advice, and the additions and sub
tractions were implemented in 
record time to begin the springsemester: The official verdict is 
still out, but preliminary com
ments suggest that, for the most 
part, CMDS has moved towards a 
measurable increase in student 
satisfaction. Roger Heydt, assis
tant dining service director, said 
We knew we needed changes. We 
asked, What can we do in this 
short amount of time to better 
customer response?1
Much of what the CMDS has 
accomplished is already evident 
to anyone who frequents any of 
the units run by the service. High
lander features a grill, and a new 
station to both wok vegetables and 
make waffles to personal taste.
Morewood Gardens implemented 
a deli-by-the-ounce while slightly 
reducing its salad selection. Fi
nally, Domino's cash allowances 
have fallen 30 cents and 
MorePizza has been closed for 
the semester.
In addition, modifications are 
being made behind the scenes 
which students may or may not 
observe directly. Says Heydt, Ev
erything we are serving at the 
Highlander now is tried and true. 
 We now serve the most popular 
items and vegetarian dishes, 
rather, than worrying about the 
second or third most popular. 
Experimentation has, however, 
not fallen prey to more field tested 
methods and dishes. CMDS has 
introduced a lean hamburger at a
special limited-time price; man
agement is considering extend
ing, while brainstorming for 
new concepts continues.
The changes come on the 
heels of several student sur
veys, the results of the last of 
which were not available until 
the week before the break. 
CMDS had previously met in 
focus groups with both student 
representatives and Marriott 
personnel (the company which 
manages the dining service) to 
discuss changes, the impor
tance of survey results, and 
methods employed by other col
leges. The do-it-yourself con

At tomorrows Student Sen
ate meeting a petition will be 
brought to vote which lists stu
dents who support the repeal of 
the recently passed resolution 
concerning ROTC. The resolu
tion in question states that if 
ROTC does not put an end to a 
policy which many see as dis
criminating against gays and les
bians, the University is to rid
the campus of all ROTC pro
grams by the 1995-96 academic 
year. The resolution was met 
with mixed reactions by students 
on campus.
Patrick Mooney, member at 
large of the Student Senate, is 
the initiator of the petition which 
392 people have signed. He sees 
a couple of problems with the 
resolution. [The resolution] 
mistakes facts, said Mooney. 
He said that just because ROTC 
discriminates, that doesnt mean 
CMU. discriminates. ROTC has 
its own building and its own
scholarships, and allows people 
with different sexual orientation 
to participate in the ROTC pro
gram.
With the petition, Mooney 
wants to let the students state 
their opinions. Article 7, Section 
2 of the Student Senate Consti
tution states that if the students
dont like a resolution they can 
get 250 signatures and the Sen

Site development of Carnegie 
Mellons new University Center 
has not yet begun because 
fundraising for the $41 million 
project is not complete, accord
ing to Vice President of Busi
ness Affairs Pat Keating. Con
struction was tentatively slated 
to begin in November 1991, but 
CMU continues to wait because 
the largest donation for the 
project is not yet finalized.
Keating reports that $10 mil
lion has been raised for the 
project to date and emphasizes 
that as of now, fundraising is of 
highest priority, particularly
with one individual donor. The 
donor Keating speaks of is an 
alumnus and very supportive of 
the project. Because builders 
require two-thirds to threefourths of the financing in order 
to begin, the projects develop
ment basically rests on this do
nor because he may be present
ing CMU with a $20 million gift.
Ed Schatz, project manager, 
assures that design plans for 
the building are in the final 
phases and should be completed 
by March 30. After this date, the 
erection of the center is com
pletely contingent upon collec
tion. of funds.
Once construction begins, it 
will take a minimum of two years
to complete. The new center will 
house all of the same student 
activities that Skibo Hall pres
ently contains, as well as pro
viding dining services and a 
bookstore. It will also offer new 
gym facilities including a pool, 
and squash and racquetball 
courts. The building itself will 
be larger than Skibo, extending 
onto the visitor parking lot, to
ward the tennis courts, and up 
to the sidewalk around the ath
letic field.
The extension onto the park
ing lot presents the University 
with a problem., because the 
visitors lot may lose 80 to 100 
spaces. The City of Pittsburgh 
requires that these spaces be
relocated elsewhere on campus, 
but as of now, no concrete ar
rangements have been made.
Final arrangements have not 
yet been made to relocate the 
facilities Skibo now contains. 
Administrators are considering 
several alternative actions re
garding temporary organization 
of dining facilities, including a 
more extensive cart service and 
some renovations in Morewood, 
but nothing is final.
Carnegie Mellon is consider
ing purchasing the Navy Build
ing on Forbes Avenue and mov
ing larger student activities 
there, but must wait for the 
Naval Reserves to relocate in 
order to make this move.

One year later and Saddam is still in control
: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (DJ)  It is 
D-Day plus a year, and almost every
thing has changed, The Wall Street 
'Journal reported.
; One year ago this week, American 
warplanes opened the six-week war 
that drove Iraq from Kuwait. Today, 
Kuwait is free, oil prices have fallen by 
!nearly half, Iraqs nuclear program is 
toeing dismantled, and Arabs and Is
raelis are talking peace.
; But one thing hasnt changed: 
Saddam Hussein is still standing. In 
fact, the White Houses political woes 
raise the bizarre possibility that, despite his crushing defeat, Saddam 
Hussein actually could outlast his nemesis, George Bush, in power.
! The story of how Saddam Hussein 
has survived despite suffocating eco
nomic sanctions and growing internal 
dissent lies in large part in a cunning, 
little-understood economic support sys
tem the Iraqi ruler quietly constructed 
over the past two decades. The central 
question now is whether this life-supjport system  coupled with a wellknown system of internal terrorwill 
enable him to grind down the will of the 
international community and outlive 
the United Nations sanctions designed 
to strangle his economy.
In conversations with an array of 
U.S. officials, private American inves
tigators, and exiled Iraqi officials, there 
is uncertainty about the extent of Iraqs 
clandestine foreign economic activity, 
but all agree that it has been key to 
Husseins survival. Former Iraqi offi
cials say the story begins in the early 
1970s, when Iraq began siphoning oil 
revenue into a kind of giant political 
slush fund. This eventually built a 
multibillion-dollar financial cushion 
that is now helping sustain Saddam 
Hussein despite the U.N. sanctions.
Then, during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq 
war, Saddam Husseins lieutenants 
created a subterranean network of trad
ing companies to feed his war machine. 
The network now operates from Jordan 
and Switzerland to maintain a skeletal 
economy and keep his cronies satisfied 
despite sanctions.
Weve been in this business a long 
time, and weve never seen a procure
ment network put together like the one 
used by the Iraqis in the 1980s, says 
Jules Kroll, head of Kroll Associates 
Inc., the New York investigation firm 
Kuwait hired to track , down Iraqs 
money. We believe they are now busy 
reconstructing that network using dif
ferent names.
Obviously, Saddam Hussein needs 
more than money to survive. Fearful of 
enemies within, he has been consoli
dating power into an ever-smaller circle 
of relatives and cronies, many from his 
hometown of Tikrit. Within the last 
few months, he has replaced his prime 
minister, defense minister, and inte
rior minister.
Now, Arab diplomats report tantaliz
ing hints of dissension within even that 
small circle of confidants. In one recent 
incident, these people say, the personal 
guards of the new Iraqi defense minis
ter, who is Saddam Husseins cousin, 
exchanged gunfire with the security 
guards of the new interior minister,
who is Saddam Husseins half-brother.
Both the American and Saudi Ara
bian governments in recent weeks have 
broadened their contacts with Iraqi dis
sidents, sensing that the fractious 
Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish elements of 
the opposition may finally be starting 
to pull together. Saudi Arabia is trying 
to arrange an international conference 
bringing together the full spectrum of 
Iraqi opposition groups. At least seven 
opposition radio transmitters are beam
ing anti-Saddam messages into Iraq 
from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Ku
wait, and Egypt.
In the U.S., the Bush administration 
has just completed a quiet policy re
view that laid new plans to help Saddam 
Husseins foes if an internal insurrec
tion begins. Administration officials 
insist that while they would love to see 
Saddam Husseins exit, it isnt crucial 
to see him go. They argue that the war 
effectively ended his ability to intimi
date his neighbors  and cite as proof 
the successful launching of the ArabIsraeli peace process despite Iraqs viru
lent opposition.
Nonetheless, Saddam Husseins con
tinuing presence is an acute political 
embarrassment for President Bush as 
he faces a re-election campaign. For the 
Saudi Arabians, it is worse than that: 
They see Saddam Hussein as a stand
ing threat.
Just yesterday, Robert Gates, the U.S. 
director of central intelligence, said in 
Congressional testimony that Iraq will 
remain a primary threat to develop 
weapons of mass destruction as long as 
Saddam Hussein remains in power.
Iraqi dissidents argue that the time 
to oust Saddam Hussein is this year. 
To tell you the truth, I cant put more 
than a 50-50 hope on the chances fora 
change, says Salah al-Shaikhly, a 
former Iraqi government planner who 
now is active in the opposition. But, he 
says, If that 50% is to materialize, its 
going to have to happen in the next few 
months. Eventually, he says, the 
clamor for doing business with oil-rich 
Iraq will undermine international sup
port for sanctions.Bush and Yeltsin plan 
economic conference
' WASHINGTON,Jan.l6(AP)PresidentBush 
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will hold 
talks at the White House on Feb. 1, the White 
iiouse said.
; Their one-on-one meeting will come the day 
fifter they join other heads of state at a summit in 
J'Jew York for leaders of the 15 countries on the 
.United Nations Security Council.
! It will be the fourth meeting for Bush and 
Yeltsin, including two previous visits by the Rus
sian leader to the White House.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, who 
revealed the plans for a Bush-Yeltsin meeting in 
n interview with wire service reporters, said 
JVTeltsin is facing a very, very difficult situation 
inside Russia and the new Commonwealth of 
Independent States, the successor to the shat
tered Soviet Union.
 Yeltsin now draws the criticisms that plagued 
former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
when he was in charge in Moscow, Scowcroft said.
; This is a very, very tough time, said Scowcroft.
\ The United States must help nourish the 
threads of democracy and help them grow, 
Scowcroft said, because whenever you have the 
land of chaos, turbulence and so on that you have 
inside there now, theres always a tendency to go 
to more draconian ways to solve problems.
\ Next Wednesday, Bush will address the inter
national conference being convened here by the 
United States to coordinate humanitarian assis
tance for the new countries of the now-disbanded 
Soviet Union. The United States has provided $4 
billion in food aid over the past year, including 
$2.2 billion since the August coup temporarily 
overthrew Gorbachev.
Scowcroft called the January 31 summit at the 
United Nations a unique event that will draw at 
least 14 heads of state to New York.
Chinese Premier Li Peng plans to attend the 
summit and has asked to meet separately with 
Bush. The White House, however, has not yet 
responded to his request.
Scowcroft said Bushs crowded schedule for 
February 1 has not been finalized.
The talks with Yeltsin will focus on the evolving 
relations among the former republics of the Soviet 
Union, economic reforms, the attempt to central
ize military control over the former superpowers 
nuclear arsenal and other issues, he said.
 Yeltsin was the hero of last Augusts abortive 
coup when he defied the tanks that surrounded 
the Russian White House. Now he is being blamed 
for his countrys skyrocketing prices and persis
tent food shortages.
Scowcroft praised Yeltsins recent move to free 
artificially low prices in Russia as steps in the 
right direction. But he said it is still too soon for 
the United States and others to try to help stabi
lize the ruble.
Theres still no control over the budget, he 
said.

BEIJING, Jan. 17 (AP)  
China today applauded its suc
cessful copyright talks with the 
U.S. as setting a good prece
dent for resolving other trade 
disputes with Washington.
China hopes that both sides 
will continue the positive ap
proach and appropriately settle 
other trade disputes as soon as 
possible through negotiations 
on an equal and friendly ba
sis, the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade 
said in a statement.
The two sides reached agree
ment late yesterday on Chinese 
measures to better protect U.S. 
copyrights and patents. The U.S. 
had said it would impose puni
tive tariffs on a range of Chinese 
exports starting yesterday if 
China didnt agree to improve 
its protection of U.S. intellec
tual property.
U.S. trade officials called
China the single largest 
pirater worldwide ofU.S. copy
rights. U.S. businesses con
tend that they lose $430 mil
lion annually from Chinese 
copyright violations.
China and the U.S. are still 
negotiating over U.S. demands 
that China lift trade barriers. 
Congress also has said it will 
try again this year to link 
Chinas most-favored nation 
trade status to human rights.
Students riot in Moscow
MOSCOW, Jan. 17 (AP)  
Hundreds of students angered 
by soaring prices smashed shop 
windows and fought police in 
the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, 
leaving one student dead and 
several wounded, news agencies 
reported.
Several militiamen were also 
wounded in the riot Thursday 
night, the Russian Information 
Agency said. The riots occurred 
on the same day Uzbek authori
ties freed prices and introduced 
food coupons.
The students broke the win
dows of food stores displaying 
goods they said were far too ex
pensive for them to afford, said 
Alfred Baranov, the deputy chief
of theUzbeknews agency Uztag.
The rioting occurred in the socalled University Town, a stu
dents quarter in the northwest 
of Tashkent. The disturbance 
was the worst of its kind re
ported since most of the former 
Soviet republics freed prices on 
many goods earlier this month.
A Tashkent-based journalist, 
Anvar Usmonov, said the stu
dents attempted to march to the 
palace of the president of the 
former Soviet republic. He esti
mated the size of the crowd at 
10,000.
Police fired blanks in the air 
which were ineffective, failing 
to disperse the students, he said. 
Then police opened fire with live
ammunition, he said, adding 
that witnesses reported seeing 
several people fall to the ground.
Usmonov quoted a reliable of
ficial source as saying that one 
student was killed and two were 
badly wounded.
Police then dispersed the 
crowd using clubs to beat the 
students. The rioters were then 
chased back to their dormito
ries, Usmonov said.
At least 100 students were re
portedly arrested.

The Library Information Sys
tem II is near completion and 
will be available throughout 
campus on the Andrewnetwork 
to anyone with a user identifi
cation. It can now be accessed 
from any office, dormitory, or 
cluster through Andrew, in
stead of only through Hunt Li
brary.
LIS II has many new fea
tures. Examples include the 
user being able to mail and 
save index information to per
sonal files and keep track of 
numerous search results.
The new system provides the 
library catalog with a struc
tural change through which da
tabases can be added to a num
ber of servers. Because the 
new system allows for many 
servers, each database on LIS
II can have a separate index, as 
well as easy access to other 
indexes. LIS I consisted of one 
large index.
The different databases al
low for more sophisticated 
searching, thus giving LIS II 
more functionality than the old 
system. The addition of space 
on the new system is much 
simpler and less expensive than 
LIS I. The new system also
Corrections...
runs considerably faster than  
the previous index.
Much time was needed to 
develop the telecommunica( 
tion links to connect the Andrew network and Internet. 
As Library Interim Director 
Barbara Richards said, The 
new LIS II system was the A 
most cost efficient way to exr 
pand our system by using the  
new technology and software * 
available.
There are two kinds of access to the new system. The 
VT-100 interface is available 
to many machines including 
the Macintosh and PC. There _ 
is also the MOTIF interface' 
which allows UNIX access to ' 
the system. The MOTIF inter-" 
face allows the user to see more - 
than one window at a time. 1 
The user can see and refer to ' 
the search and results win
dows without having to change 4 
screens. Plans for future en
hancement of LIS II on UNIX ' 
over the next year include al-" 
lowing the user to view fax' 
images.
Getting Started data sheets  
are available in the library,1 
and librarian assistance is 
readily available for first time 
users. Manuals can also be  
purchased at the computer *

CMDS institutes improvements
zr:i 9nc0 baRt eUniversity of Michigan and Allegheny 
College, while increasing the size of the 
glassware at Highlander was a direct 
response to the final survey findings. 
It was give-and-take the entire way, 
said Heydt, We will still have to fine 
tune awhile, but the initial response is 
extremely favorable.
Dennis Stanhoff, manager at High
lander, confirms Heydts conclusions. 
Comment cards put out by CMDS have 
proven highly positive and full of fur
ther suggestion, while the numbers 
themselves are bright. Says Stanhoff, 
We are still getting used to increased 
customer flow. The lunch totals have 
jufnped from 400 to 600 while dinner 
hais moved form about 700 to 800.
While both admit there are still some 
steps to be taken, Stanhoff says My 
employees are happy and people stop 
me out there to tell me they like [the 
changes].
Financially, people are telling Din
ing Services they like the changes. With 
the closing of Morepizza and the com
bination of restricting capital and oper
ating expenses CMDS has been able to 
erase over $100,000 of their projected 
red ink.
They have not had to lay off any of 
their hourly employees, but they were 
forced to let the MorePizza manager go 
and reduce overall employee hours. 
Carnegie Mellon Dining Service still 
faces a $200,000 projected debt, but 
plans to defray that cost over the course
of several years.
What is in store for CMU diners, says 
Hedyt, is more, or less decided by a 
process of dealing with the overall 
scheme. Nothing is decided yet, but, of 
course, we are talking about plans that 
would encourage more participation. 
While some of the food selection is still 
subject to change, the costs of meals 
and the meal-plan format in general is. 
next to be evaluated. Cash allowances, 
number of meals per plan, and new 
meal options will all be discussed.
Morewood itself may in fact be in line 
for renovation. For the moment, how
ever, CMDS is concentrating on pro
ducing a follow-up survey and fielding 
ideas. Said Heydt, We are still identi
fying the questions to ask.

years at Carnegie Mellon. She earned a 
bachelors degree in music from 
Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
1946 and a masters degree in music

The Graduate Student Organization 
passed a resolution at its December 11 
meeting which calls for investigation of 
the need for adequate and affordable 
health insurance coverage. GSO be
lieves such health coverage would im
prove CMUs competitive position for 
recruiting the best graduate students 
and calls upon CMU President Robert 
Mehrabian to establish a committee to 
examine the feasibility of providing paid 
health benefits to graduate students.
The report proposed short term and 
long term solutions to the problems. 
The short term solutions are simple 
enough to be implemented starting this 
month, yet effective enough to yield 
significant improvements in the qual
ity of health care at CMU. Many of the 
issues and proposed solutions also are 
relevant to undergraduates.
GSO calls upon the Office of the Dean 
for Student Affairs to take immediate 
action to implement the 
recommendations of the report.

Petition challenges 
ROTC resolution
PDLzi 9nc0 baRt 1
mine the feelings of the general cam
pus body. I expect some very small 
percentage of campus to come out, 
said Altmann.
After the referendum, Student Sen
ate must evaluate the results and de
cide whether to revoke the resolution 
or not. This is clearly Mooneys intent, 
but something which Altmann believes 
will not happen. However, Altmann 
points out that if 80 percent or so of 
the campus voted to repeal the resolu
tion, Senate would be much more likely 
to do what the campus called for. The 
increased number of ROTC students 
on Senate also makes it a stronger 
possibility that the resolution will be 
overturned. I expect that it will be 
more likely than in the past Senate 
[that the resolution will be repealed], 
said Altmann, but I still dont think it 
will happen.
However, Mooney disagrees with the 
resolution and claims it contains many 
flaws. He claims that the only way 
that ROTC discriminates is in giving
money, but that gays and lesbians 
may take part in the classes and wear 
the uniforms. Mooney also said it didnt 
bother people that other programs on 
campus discriminate as well, citing 
the NAACP as an example, because it 
does not award scholarships to 
caucasions.
Another problem Mooney sees lies 
in the fact that he believes the resolu
tion is directing its hostilities towards 
the ROTC students on campus when 
the attacks should go to the source of 
the problem  the Department of 
Defense in Washington which makes 
all the regulations.
Altmann believes that most Sena
tors will come to realize that it would 
be a real step backwards to repeal the 
resolution, and that a referendum is 
not an accurate way to sample the 
prevailing view on campus. Whether 
or not Senate eventually decides to 
repeal the resolution, Carnegie Mellon 
students may soon be given the oppor
tunity to give their opinions on it 
through a referendum vote.

CMDS improves dining 
at CMU eateries
Recent changes in Dining Ser
vice have elicited mixed re
sponses. Alterations have been 
made to all dining facilities, in
cluding Dominos service. Some 
minor adjustments were made 
to menus, and a major reorgani
zation of Morewood Gardens 
took place.
First and foremost, MorePizza 
is closed permanently. Some stu
dents, especially those who live 
in Morewood and Mudge and 
those who preferred MorePizza 
over Dominos, are inconve
nienced by the discontinued ser
vice, but the need to cut losses 
outweighs the effort to please 
everyone. This step is satisfac
tory because it will save money, 
yet allow the alternative service 
of Dominos delivery.
At first glance, the reduction 
in the Dominos Delivery cash 
allowance looks like a ripoff. In 
fact, two meal plans under the 
new allowance will buy a me
dium pizza with one topping, a 
decent meal for two people. The 
thirty-cent reduction in the al
lowance is insignificant.
Closing Morewood Gardens for 
dinner Friday nights was a mis
take. Residents of Morewood and 
Mudge have found themselves 
inconvenienced when it comes 
to weekend meals on campus. 
Some of these students choose 
their residences specifically for 
the convenience of the Morewood 
cafeteria. Theyre being cheated, 
as are those who arent on meal 
plans and prefer the a la carte 
prices at Morewood to the high 
cover charge at Highlander.
On a more favorable note, the 
new organization of Morewood 
Gardens boosts our confidence
in CMDS management. The selfserve deli with a larger and bet
ter selection is fairly priced. This 
adds appeal to the cafeteria.
Highlander cafe still needs im
provement, especially in the 
length of its lines, despite good 
efforts. The food has improved, 
and the do-it-yourself waffle 
maker and vegetable wok add 
opportunities for students to 
improve their culinary skills. 
However, they take longer than 
just pickmgup already-prepared 
food, exacerbating the problem 
of long lines.
In addition, CMDS has at
tempted to placate unhappy stu
dents who decide that they 
would rather not patronize cam
pus facilities. Students can re
duce meal plans, cancel a fivemeal plan, convert a meal plan 
into non-refundable cash allow
ance restricted to Dining Ser
vice facilities ortoValadine. The 
actual meal plan has not yet 
been revamped as the facilities 
have.
A possible alternative would 
be to allow students to deposit 
money into Validine and use 
their IDs, much as they can buy 
groceries with a MAC card. 
Management would have to 
charge for the convenient ser
vice or find some other way to 
make it worthwhile to CMDS.
The changes are signs of 
progress, even if some arent 
good ideas. The endeavor should 
continue, so CMDS can attract 
students to the program instead 
of losing them. Through careful 
management and continued ef
fort, CMDS will one day be able 
to please the crowds and stay 
out of the red.

In past years, Physical Plant 
has done an excellent j ob of keep
ing campus walkways safe and 
clear of snow. However, this 
pattern of concern for the quick 
removal of snow and ice to en
sure the safety of the campus 
community was broken during 
the past week.
Specifically, it appears that no 
effort was made early Thurs
day, January 16, to remove snow 
from or spread salt on any of the 
campus walkways or stairs. Al
though Physical Plant began to 
clear walkways much later in 
the day (after noon, from our 
observations), several key routes 
on campus were never cleared, 
including the walks around 
Morewood Gardens and Mudge 
House, as well as the diagonal 
walkways from Forbes to Skibo 
and from Skibo to Doherty. The 
sidewalk in front of the library, 
stretching from Baker Hall to 
GSIA, also remained uncleared 
of snow.
Such inaction is inexcusable. 
The presence of snow on the 
walkways makes getting around 
campus difficult and dangerous. 
Every attempt should have been 
made to clear at least the major 
walkways before the majority of 
the campus community needed 
to use them. Because the walks 
were not cleared, the snow be
came hard-packed and even 
more treacherous to walk on. As
the day continued, the the walk
ways became a giant sloppy mess 
Physical Plant was still slow to 
remove.
Physical Plant began clearing 
walks only after the academic 
day was well under way. We 
hope no one slipped and got hurt 
while attempting to navigate a 
slick and snowy campus Thurs
day morning. If it is not possible 
to clear the entire campus be
fore the academic day begins, 
salt should be spread on all stair
ways, and preferably all walk
ways as well. Even so, these 
efforts should not diminish 
Physical Plants responsibility 
to continue clearing all campus 
walkways.
It is worth noting that Physi
cal Plants response to Friday 
nights snowfall was somewhat 
more reassuring, as all the walk
ways were salted by Saturday 
morning (albeit by hand, due to 
a broken salt spreader). Still, 
the necessary follow-up of re
moving the resulting slush from 
the walks never occurred.
Lets hope that the less-thanadequate clean-up job from last 
week can be attributed to the 
first real snowfall of the year 
and not to negligence or budget 
cutbacks. No one wants to have 
to struggle to keep his or her 
footing on the way to classes or 
work, and we wont have to, if 
Physical Plant does its job.

Resolutions boost egos falsely
Jason McDonald
Its a brand new year. In some ways, 
Im very excitedits my last semester 
of college (barring natural disaster or 
Godzilla attack), and the proverbial 
slate is clean.
At least thats what were led to be
lieve. Unfortunately, the sad fact of life 
is that the more things change, the 
more things stay the same.
People all over the world go through 
the motions, though. Thats right, Im 
talking about the New Years Resolu
tion, the most hypocritical, buffoonish, 
and generally useless gesture known to 
humanity. Actually, it comes in a close 
second to the phrase, Hot enough for 
you? but thats another column en
tirely.
I always get the feeling that people 
make resolutions more for the benefit 
of others than for themselves. People 
dont make resolutions so they can set 
a goal; if anyone really wanted to do 
that theyd just do it without all the 
fuss, and without waiting for the calen
dar to roll over.
What theyre really after is the pat on 
the back, the utterances of What a 
good person you are! from friends and 
family, and the acknowledgement of 
their noble natures. Whether or not 
they actually hold to the resolution 
makes no difference, in the cosmic 
scheme of things. After all, whos going 
to come down on someone who tried to 
do such a noble thing as cutting off that 
nasty addiction to SPAM or Maude 
reruns?
Now Im sure that a lot of people 
wonder how I can maintain such a 
cynical outlook on life. Cheer up, they 
say. People arent really that bad. 
Obviously, theyre not watching the 
same channel I am.
My defense is simple: How can I look 
forward to a bright new 1992 when the 
ACLU has to come to bat for a toad like 
David Duke in the name of the First
Amendment?
When Knots Landing still roams the 
airwaves, and people still think studio 
wrestling is real. When most peoples 
idea of great comedy is giving the finger 
to a camera. (As an aside, New Years 
Eve is the last time I ever leave my 
camera unattended at a party.) There 
are too many idiots out there; Im just 
playing the safe odds by betting on the 
side of stupidity.
Over the semester break, my belief in 
the shallowness of the resolution syslong Person A would stay on the wagon' 
when he heard about Person As deci
sion.
Person B also broke his resolution 
within a week and defended it by tell
ing me that it wasnt very much beer. 
Try telling me that the New Years 
Resolution isnt a giant ego massage.
Dont get me wrong, though. The 
idea of being a better citizen is a noble 
one, but I wonder whether the artifi
cial New Years aggrandizement is 
needed. Im far from being the perfect
I always get the feeling that people make 
resolutions more for the benefit of others 
than for themselves. People dont make 
resolutions so they can set a goal; if anyone 
really wanted to do that they'd just do it 
without all the fuss, and without waiting for 
the calendar to roll over.What they're really 
after is the pat on the back ... and the

Whether or not they actually hold to the

mic scheme of things.
tem was reaffirmed by the following 
situation. Person A decides to quit 
drinking in mid-December. He doesnt 
wait for January to stand on the cliff 
under the stars and make a solemn 
pledge to the powers that be. He just 
does it (sorry to sound like a Nike com
mercial), and the first time its even 
noticed is when he goes out to a bar and 
orders a ginger ale.
Person B calls all his friends to an
nounce his glorious decision, and pro
ceeds to break into a half-hour 
unsolicited rationalization for his deci
sion, punctuated by 10 or 12 repetitions 
of Dont you think its a good idea? 
Person B, strangely enough, is the same 
person who wanted to put bets on how
person; I have people lined up around 
the corner to remind me of that fectProm time to time, I take the trouble to 
do a little fine tuning, but its my bus'" 
ness.
The only overt promise I made this 
past New Years Day was a purely pi'aS" 
matic oath never to eat another $2- 
pizza from The Original. Lets just say 
that on New Years Eve, I think I 
ured out why its only three bucks.

'PC7 threatens Nude Olympics
Chris Restifo
You know, all of this PC stuff 
is beginning to sicken me. Both 
liberals and conservatives sling 
the term around, trying to use it 
to their advantages.
It makes me mad, but really 
does little damage since students 
are typically the ones doing the 
PC things. So far, with all the 
debate going on among cam
puses, our administration has 
been pretty cool about the whole 
thing.
In this day and age, however, 
we would do well to keep an 
especially watchful eye on the 
University. Anyone who was 
here last year will undoubtedly 
remember the Student Dormi
tory Council-sponsored Suitcase 
Dance, the culmination of Sex 
Week, a program designed to 
educate students about safe sex, 
relationships, and other impor
tant related topics.
The winner was supposed to 
get a free room at a fancy hotel 
the night of the dance, but Dean 
of Student Affairs Mike Murphy, 
giving in to outside pressure, 
canceled that. The winner got a 
chaperoned trip to New York 
City.
In an article in the Student 
Union, Matt Ruben did an excel
lent job of showing how the ad
ministration was overstepping 
its bounds by controlling stu
dent behavior. The administra
tion hardly even thought about 
what its intervention meant to 
students, outsiders, and the 
Universitys own principle of. 
serving students.
The administration of 
Prineeton University is doing the 
same thing. The dean of stu
dents there, Eugene Lowe, Jr.,
who is also a religion professor, 
wishes to put an end to the Nude 
Olympics, a 21-year tradition.
A year after women were first 
admitted to Princeton, people 
started participating in antics 
during the first snow of the sea
son. It originally started with 
some guys skiing around in their 
shorts, but now the tradition 
includes events like push-ups 
and sit-ups in the nude.
Some people in the Princeton 
administration are concerned 
that this type of behavior does 
not present the proper image 
' and that it makes women and 
minorities feel uncomfortable. 
Lowe wrote a letter to the school 
newspaper about the issue and 
is asking people in the adminis
tration to consider taking ac
tion.
As youve probably guessed by 
now, alcohol is usually involved. 
Last year in January 200 sopho
mores, 60 of which were women, 
ran naked into a crowd of about
1500. A few of the students had 
to be taken to the school clinic 
for alcohol abuse.
In my opinion, the dean of 
students at Princeton should get 
his head out of the sand and his 
nose out of the business of stu
dents. The sophomore class 
president is already taking steps 
to notify students that they will 
be responsible for their behav
ior. He is also working with the 
sexual harassment advisory 
group to form teams of sober 
sophomores who will patrol the 
Nude Olympics to make sure 
that no one is assaulted.
I have no clue as to how the 
Nude Olympics can make 
women and minorities feel un
comfortable. Does this imply that
if women and minorities ran 
around naked in the snow, white 
males would feel insecure? 
Women participate in the Nude 
Olympics, and from what I 
gather', it is an open event. Po
lice even have a hard time moni
toring it, because its so sponta
neous. How could it therefore 
discriminate or harass it own 
participants?
Perhaps the most blatant ex
ample of how out of touch with 
students the administration of 
Princeton is comes in a state
ment by an assistant dean of 
students, Sandra Silverman. 
She is somewhat surprised that 
women feel so strongly about 
participating in a mens event 
rather than attempting to come 
up with an event that addresses 
womens needs.
Silverman made this brilliant 
statement after attending an all 
female forum organized by 
Princetons womens center, the 
sexual harassment advisory
group, and the sophomore class 
president. This forum was cre
ated specifically to educate 
women about the Nude Olym
pics and to encourage them to 
participate. Silverman hardly 
appears qualified to make any
type of decision on this matter, 
just like the regular dean of stu
dents.
Face it, my friends, this con
troversy is nothing more than 
an administration trying to 
muscle students into following 
acceptable patterns of behav
ior. Lowe and Silverman are both 
completely ignorant as to what 
the students want.
With the steps the students 
have taken, it is apparent that 
they wish to keep the Nude 
Olympics and make it a safe, fun 
event for its participants. 
Theyve even organized a social 
event on another part of campus 
the night of the Nude Olympics. 
Students not wishing to partici
pate in them can drink hot choco
late and go sledding at another 
location.
What does this have to do with 
me and you, students here at 
Carnegie Mellon University? 
Pretty soon, Sex Week will be 
upon us.
Although there are no plans 
for a Suitcase Dance, there are 
some things that can be taken 
wrong by people outside 
Carnegie Mellon University. For 
example, there will be films and 
activities that close-minded 
people might consider inappro
priate because they deal openly 
with sex and sexual orientation.
If the administration here 
wishes to appear as though it 
really supports the students, 
then it will do just that  sup
port them. It will not attempt to 
override whatever Student Dor
mitory Council and the students 
decide is appropriate for Sex 
Weeks content. That is, it will 
not make an attempt unless it 
wishes to look foolish and out of 
touch like the Princeton admin
istration.
Chris Restifo is a junior chemi
cal engineering major who 
wouldnt mind it ifCMUhad the 
Sex Week Nude Olympics.
In this day and age, however, we would do well to keep 
an especially watchful eye on the University.... I have no 
clue as to how the Nude Olympics can make women and 
minorities feel uncomfortable. Does this imply that if 
women and minorities ran around naked in the snow, 
white males would feel insecure? Women participate in 
the Nude Olympics, and from what I gather, it is an open 
event. Police even have a hard time monitoring it, be
cause its so spontaneous. How could it therefore dis
criminate or harass its own participants?... Face it, my 
friends, this controversy is nothing more than an admin
istration trying to muscle students into following ac
ceptable patterns of behavior.... Pretty soon, Sex Week 
will be upon us._____________________
Student safety jeopardized
Why do students insist on walking home alone? 
A lot of it has to do with the Carnegie Mel Ions 
Escort Service. First, the Escort Service will 
only take passengers up to one and a half miles 
from campus. Also, it will not transport people 
from private residences, such as apartments, to 
campus.
Rich Robinson
Safety on campus has always been 
an issue. At the beginning of this se
mester, the safety of CMU students 
came into serious question. Two inci
dents occurred on January 12, just two 
days before the first day of classes. One 
was an attempted robbery inside Skibo 
at the MAC machines. The second, and 
more troubling, was a rape in a 
Shadyside apartment building.
In the rape case, the student was 
walking alone to her apartment and 
was followed through a slow-closing 
door into the building. These problems 
are not limited to Carnegie Mellon, 
though.
Last semester, a Pitt student was 
sexually assaulted in Forbes Quad, 
and there were a number of muggings 
m Oakland and Shadyside.
But why do these crimes occur? Why 
do students insist on walking home 
^lone? A lot of it has to do with the 
Carnegie Mellons Escort Service. First, 
the Escort Service will only take pasSengers up to one and a half miles from 
campus. Also, it will not transport 
People from private residences, such 
as apartments, to campus.
These students, then, must walk 
alne to their apartments, inviting 
some type of crime upon themselves, 
^specially at night. It is not Escorts 
fault, though.
ft does have a limited time to make 
^ns so that people do not stand alone 
outside waiting for the van to show up.
also has limited money to pay driv
es and keep up the vehicles, 
out a new dimension has opened up 
Ue to the surrounding universities.
Because they are so close, CMU students 
regularly travel to Pitt to use the library or 
attend classes, and Duquesne, Pitt, and 
Chatham students come to CMU.
Generally, the universities have a large 
exchange of students that use the various 
resources of the different schools. Also, on 
the weekends, students travel to other 
schools for parties and to visit friends.
This is probably the most important 
time for safe travel because late at night 
on the weekends, students walking home 
are usually intoxicated.
Because of this, they are usually less 
aware of what is going on around them 
and are more likely to be the victim of a 
crime.
But CMU Escort and shuttle, like other 
universities, will not transport students 
from other universities. Although 
Duquesne has the Happy Bus that will 
pick up Duquesne students at CMU, it 
does not run past 2:30 am. Many parties 
on campus last past this time, so if a 
Duquesne student misses the last bus, she 
or he must walk home, unless they know a 
CMU student they can stay with.
Although the Escort Service is trying to 
operate for the students, it alone does not 
have the resources to provide efficient and 
safe travel for everyone.
This leaves a number of students to fend 
for themselves and to be at risk of being
assaulted, mugged, or even raped, because 
they are not students of a given university, 
or they live outside an arbitrary service 
radius.
But due to the assaults last semester, a 
plan has been drawn up at the University of 
Pittsburgh. According to The Pitt News, a 
Presidential Task Force on Campus Safety 
is reviewing the possibility of starting an 
Escort service for students or linking the 
transportation systems of local universi
ties.
The committee is also looking into the 
redeployment of Pitts campus police in or
der to make the transportation service safer 
for pick-ups and drop-offs.
The committee, however, expects a recom
mendation to be out by the end of the term. 
Their hearts may be in the right place, but 
changes have to be made before then. Stu
dents cannot wait another year before they 
can feel safe on their campus. Students need 
to have safe transportation and need to feel 
safe on campus now.
The Pitt News did not mention if CMU was 
involved with the subcommittee, but only 
that it was suggested that Duquesne, CMU, 
and Pitt link their transportation systems.
Carnegie Mellon should take the initia
tive from here. CMUs Escort Service is not 
adequate. Many off-campus students and 
non-University students are excluded from 
the safe transportation Escort provides.
But if CMU, Duquesne, and Pitt 
were to link their systems and set up 
some type of agreement to transport 
students not going to that school, all 
of the students going to the local uni
versities would be safer.
Non-CMU students could ride the 
Escort home, instead ofwalkinghome 
alone from a late night at the library 
or a party. CMU students who live 
beyond the mile and a half radius of 
Escorts service could ride Pitts Es
cort or Duquesnes Happy Bus. And 
all the students who go to Oakland or 
Shadyside at night for work or hang
ing out could get safe transportation 
home and not have to worry about 
being mugged, stabbed, or raped.
CMU should go to the local univer
sities now.
The administration should offer the 
manpower and assistance necessary 
to get a working transportation sys
tem out as soon as possible, not some 
recommendation by the end of the 
semester.
A step was taken last semester by 
CMUs Campus Police to work with 
other universities police to transport 
intoxicated students home. Although 
nothing concrete has been established, 
it is an example of the kind of action 
that needs to be taken.
Students commonly complain about 
schoolthe terrible food, the flooded 
walkways, and the weather. But the 
rape or mugging of a student should 
be one of the Universitys primary 
concerns.
Forget the food, forget the pools of 
water  provide the students with 
safe transportation and the peace of 
mind of knowing that they are not 
going to be in danger every time they 
walk out of their homes.

Professor Richard Tucker
This course will examine social and cognitive effects of knowing two languages, i.e. 
bilingualism. It will focus on the individual the education system and society. We will 
begin by contrasting worldwide multilingual contexts such as India, Africa and parts of 
Europe with the language situation in the U.S. We will consider topics such as the 
measurement and description of bilingualism; the relationship between native language 
acquisition and second language learning; the affective and cognitive consequences of 
becoming bilingual; the organization and implementation of programs designed to develop 
second language proficiency; and the societal repercussions of encouraging or discouraging 
second language learning or teaching programs. Examples, readings, and assignments will 
be selected to permit consideration of a range of issues from both monolingual and 
bilingual countries.

SPORTS
by Jason McDonald
Who needs AllStars? Bring 
on the thugs!
Of all the things that I could 
write about  Chuck Nolls 
resignation, Bobby Bonillas 
$29 million contract, I chose to 
write about one of the sports 
worlds stupidest traditions  
the All-Star game. Over break 
there were two more events 
that prove the futility of these 
contests.
The first was some collegiate 
Senior Bowl game. The of
fenses were strictly run-runpass-punt, and the defenses 
were so passive it looked as if 
the linemen had decided to 
take a group smoke break in 
the middle of the play. The 
second was the NHL All-Star 
game, about as close to a real 
hockey game as Dogs Playing 
Poker is to real art. I always 
have flashbacks to the days of 
Superstars, with the worlds 
greatest pro athletes running 
through those stupid red and 
blue obstacle courses, while 
Don Meredith (or whoever it 
was) pretends this is some 
important milestone in ath
letic history.
I realize that I may be in a 
minority here, but I fail to see 
the point of this. I thought the 
idea of an All-Star game was 
to see the sport played as well 
as possible by the best possible 
players, not to go through the 
motions while keeping track of 
which camera is on. It seems 
that if theyre going to waste 
ihe viewing publics time, they 
ought to give us something 
amusing.
Before I continue, Id like to 
make a distinction. I dont 
mind the idea of the Skills 
Competition portion of these 
events  hitting home runs, 
slam dunk competitions, speed 
skating and the like. At least 
in those cases, the people 
running the show realize its a 
farce, and they act accordingly. 
But when it comes to the 
actual sport, Im a bit of a 
purist. Give me the real 
McCoy or dont bother.
\ To the end of providing a 
pore interesting special event, 
why dont they try No-Star 
Games, or perhaps Marginally-Talented-B ackup Games? 
There are athletes out there 
for whom a competition like 
this might mean something 
beyond a contractual bonus. 
More importantly, these would 
be the people with nothing to 
lose by playing their hardest.
 I imagine everyone reading 
fchis is thinking, What would 
be the point? Nobody wants to 
see those players play. Well, 
whats the point of watching 
(staying with the NHL) Mario 
Lemieux score goals when no

Lemieux prepare a salad gives 
almost as much insight as to

STILL
GOING...Tartans win 12 
straight, ranked 
10th in poll
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Contributing Editor
Coming into the 1991-92 sea
son, there was good reason to 
expect a lot from the CMU 
womens basketball team. With 
most of the team returning from 
a 21-win season, things looked 
pretty promising.
A 12-game win streak, though? 
A #10 ranking in the first Divi
sion III poll of the season, the 
highest ranking in team history? 
Although there are several big 
games left on the schedule, it 
looks like this years Tartan team 
is for real, and has a strong 
chance to repeat as University 
Athletic Association champions.
My expectations were really 
high coming in, said head coach 
Gerri Seidl. We had four se
niors coming back, so I was ex
pecting a lot from this team.
What Seidl and the Tartans. 
have done so far has gone be
yond high expectations. The 
Tartans are now 6-0 in Univer
sity Athletic Association games, 
and are one loss (a 5348 defeat 
at the hands of Franklin and 
Marshall) from a perfect season 
record. In their 13 wins, the 
Tartans have an average vic
tory margin of almost 16 points.
The team has also featured 
strong individual performances: 
senior center Amy Buxbaum 
leads the team in scoring (12.5 
points per game) and rebound
ing (9.2 per game), and was 
named UAA Player of the Week 
two weeks ago. Sophomore for
ward Jeanine Megahan is also 
scoring in double digits, senior 
guards Katie Fahey and Heather 
ODonnell are close behind, and 
freshman forward Meredith 
McRnight has recently found a 
scoring touch, with back-to-back
15 point games. The rest of the 
team shouldnt be overlooked, 
though; Seidl believes depth to 
be a big reason for the Tartans 
success.
The teams most recent vic
tory, Wednesdays 72-61 win 
over Thiel College, was a mile
stone in the Tartan basketball 
program as Seidl scored her 
100th CMU victory. However, 
Seidl downplayed the personal 
importance of the win. I dont 
really see it as my 100th win, 
she said. Its the 100th win for 
the program. This program came 
from the building stages, and 
theres a lot of people who have 
been involved that most people
Senior center Amy Buxbaum scored 20 points Wednesday to lead CMU to a 72-61 win over Thiel College.
dont know about.
Thiel didnt pose much of a 
challenge to the Tartans; the 
Tomcats never got closer than 
five points after the first five 
minutes of action. A 46-32 Tar
tan rebounding advantage and
21 Thiel turnovers spelled di
saster for Thiel.
The first half featured the tal
ents of a pair of CMU freshmen: 
McKnight scored 11 of her 15 
points in the first half, while 
forward Christa Sober added six
more to push the Tartans to aZ*
39-30 lead.
According to Seidl, the suc
cess ofthefreshmen (McKnight,-- 
Sober, and Jennifer Gretz) has - 
been a big factor in the win

Sophomore forward Michael Hosni led the Tartan attack this weekend, scoring 23 points in 
Saturdays 84-80 loss to SUNY and 21 in the Tartans 90-74 Sunday win over Haverford.
By CHRIS CENKNER
Tartan Sports Editor
The CMU mens basketball team had 
its hands full this weekend with backto-back games against SUNY-Stony 
Brook on Saturday and Haverford Col
lege on Sunday. The Tartans split the 
weekend with a 84-80 overtime loss to 
Stony Brook and a 90-74 win over 
Haverford.
In the early going of Saturdays game, 
it looked as if Stony Brook was going to 
blow the game wide open. Six minutes 
into the first half, Stony Brook senior 
guard Mike Francis hit a jumper that 
put Stony Brook up 16-15, and that 
lead inflated to as much as 20 points 
before the first half ended. As the sec
ond half began, the Tartans began to 
slowly march back. Stony Brook held a
ten-point margin for most of the hal 
but a three-pointer and a field goal by 
sophomore Mike Hosni, followed by field 
goals from sophmores Matt Reiprish* 
Rony Johns, and Derek Dragisich knot
ted the game at 64 with 1:54 remain
ing. Stony Brook then hit a three-pointer 
and two free-throws, followed by a field; 
goal by Dragisich, to make the score; 
69-66 with three seconds left. The ball 
was passed into play to Hosni, who 
nailed a half-court buzzer-beater to send 
the game into overtime.
In the extra session, the Tartans con-- 
tinued their scrappy play. Unfortu--; 
nately for Coach Wingen and his troops,; 
hustle did not result in points. The' 
Tartans slowly began to slip behind* 
missing short jumpers and free-throws;' 
while the Stony Brook squad kept its

Washington should take NFL title on Super Sunday
 Welcome back. Now that Ive 
had a solid week or so to consider 
this years Super Bowl, Im kind 
of prepared to go out on a limb 
and predict a winner. Of course, 
one can never be sure. The Gi
ants arrival to last years Super 
gowl was a surprise to me, as 
well as to the rest of the leagues 
followers. That Super Bowl re
tired Bill Parcells. Speculation is 
that this could be Joe Gibbs last Super Bowl. 
Have to admit it wouldnt surprise me if he chose 
to leave should the Redskins win.
; Before I get into any Super Bowl predictions, I 
want it on record that Chuck Nolls retirement 
doesnt really come as a shock. A great loss, yes, 
but, I think the time had come. I have no idea who
Dan Rooney will choose to re
place the legendary coach, but it 
should take whomever it is quite 
some time to rebuild the Steelers.
This years draft looks like a 
particularly unsavory one. The 
senior class, as is becoming reNFL FOOTS ALL peatedlytrue , lacks any star playby Dave Martin ers worth as much as theyll deI mand. The junior class, however, 
has a few stars, as they do every 
year. Steve Emtman of the national co-champion 
University of Washington Huskies would be a 
gold mine for any team in the National Football 
League. And just recently, Amp Lee of Florida 
State University chose to come out for the NFL 
draft, a decision he made when he realized he 
couldnt make it academically. Lee would make a
Speculation is that this 
could be Joe Gibbs last 
Super Bowl.
good (and probably expensive) addition to most 
backfields.
A year ago I wasnt really given the opportunity 
to choose a winner in the big game of the year. This 
year, I almost dread the chance. Sunday, the 
Buffalo Bills and the Washington Redskins will 
take the field at the Minneapolis Metrodome for a 
monumental confrontation. The two teams with 
the best records in the NFL vie for the world 
championship. The game, like any other, could go
either way. The Bills defense has been particu
larly suspect all year, but their offense has done 
the job and outscored opponents in the close 
games and the blowouts. Washington, however, 
has shown superiority in every facet of the game 
consistently throughout the season. They have 
played like league champions from start to finish. 
One more game?
Expect the Redskins to mix the inside run game 
and the long passes, as they have all year. No 
tricks. No need. The Bills defense will play at their 
peak ability, but to no avail. The Bills cant stop 
the Redskins. By the same token, dont expect 
Washington to stop the Bills. A high scoring 
game, then? Nope. (This ones for you, Phil.) 
Redskins 21, Bills 17.

Swim teams win meets against W&J, Hiram College
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU swim teams have

The two teams then traveled 
to Hiram College on Saturday. 
The Tartans came away with 
two victories once again. The 
women topped Hiram by a score 
of 62-33, and the men gained a 
victory with the score of 57-36.
Frost once again swam to 
multiple wins as she scored first 
places in the 200-meter fly 
(2:50:25), the 200-meter back
stroke (2:50:01), and the 400- 
meter freestyle (5:12:16). Fenwick

with a time of29:27 and the 200-

of 2:59:00. Wasilonskis time of 
11:28:17 won her the 800-meter 
freestyle and Madsen won the 
200-meter individual medley
with a time of 2:54:31.
The mens team also had a 
strong showing of individual 
winners. Zimmerman was a 
double winner as he won the 50- 
meter freestyle with his time of 
25:79 and the 200-meter inde
pendent medley with a time of 
2:26:96. Sophomore Jonathan

a time of2:47:33, freshman Gary

Matoney, and junior Michael. 
Muller gained a first place in 
the 400-meter medley relay with 
their finish time of 4:43:72. 
Zimmerman said that, for this
meet, A lot of us were swim
ming in other than our usual 
events. It was a nice change of 
pace.
Coach Jim Cutrone said that 
the Tartans, swam tired. The 
times werent that fast because 
theyre recovering from training 
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
Twenty-four team members
went to Florida from December 
28 through January 11 for in
tensive training. Zimmerman 
said, The training went really 
well. It gives us a chance to con
centrate because youre away 
from school. This training is to 
help the teams gear up for con
ference competition February 
12-15.

Indoor Track Season Be
ginning This Week  CMUs 
indoor track teams are gearing 
up for their season opener on 
January 24 in the Robert Morris 
College Invitational. Both the 
mens and womens coaches are 
optimistic about the upcoming 
season.
Dario Donatelli, the womens 
coach, is looking forward to this 
season because on his squad is 
Carolyn Lowe, a two-time track 
all-American senior who com
petes in the 1500-meter, 300- 
meter, and 5000-meter racs. 
Junior Laura Sibley will be a 
bright spot for the team in the 
800-meter and 1500-meter 
races.
The mens team, coached by 
Gary Meckley, is made up of a 
well-balanced nucleus. Junior 
Brad Shapiro, senior John 
Freider, and sophomore Jim 
Langer lead the Tartans in the 
distance events, junior Chris 
Maguire and freshman Jim 
Damato compete in the sprinter/ 
hurdler events, and freshmen 
Jason Grusky, Kevin Kir, and 
Jeff Dale will compete in the

Tartan Features Editor
Blue skies, magnificent food, yappy dogs, and Europe at your 
fingertips  could life get any bettejr than that? Students at 
Carnegie Mellon can now answer that question for themselves by 
spending a semester, or even .a year, at the Universitys recently 
acquired Centre de Tours in Tours, France.
Fifteen of Carnegie Mellons bravest students pioneered the 
Universitys virgin semester at the French villa, an hours train ride 
from Paris. Formerly occupied by Stanford University, the Loire 
Valley villa had been home to Stanford students for nearly three 
decades. On September 1, 1991, CMU took over the lease and 
prepared to offer its students a splash of French life in an educa
tional and culturally exhilarating environment.
With a program geared toward enlightening and expanding the 
minds of the students, with an emphasis on French language, 
literature, art, and history, and with opportunities to travel every 
weekend of their stay, the Centre de Tours first group of students, 
living with French host families, enveloped themselves in the life of 
Europeans  living, traveling, and eating like natives.
As was the custom when Stanford owned the villa in Tours, 
Carnegie Mellons students were placed with French families who 
had volunteered to host the international students. The opportu
nity to live with a family from another country, experiencing dayto-day life with such different customs and traditions, proved to be 
a rewarding experience for junior professional writing and literary 
and cultural studies major Sheila Skaff. Her hosts were relatively 
young, 30 years old, and Skaff refers to them simply as Sylvie and 
Bruno.
I loved them so much, she says. They were more energetic than
I am!
Skaff, who spoke no French whatsoever before leaving for Tours, 
appreciated her hosts patience with her in her early days in France, 
when she still could not hold a conversation in their language. And 
even though Bruno spoke some English, he did not speak any to 
Skaff, as a sink-or-swim type move to help Skaff improve her 
, language skills.
Besides Brunos encouragement, Skaffs host family also pro! vided Skaff with a warm family environment, and great memories. 
Because it took a while for her to pick up the language, Skaff says 
it was a challenge to make French college-age friends on her own. 
It didnt seem fair to expect other French students to have the 
patience to hold a conversation with her in broken French. On the 
other hand, that is what the host family is for, and Sylvie and Bruno 
accepted the position with ease. Consequently, Skaff was invited to 
all of their parties, even to a masquerade party to which she went 
dressed as a sheep  Sylvies idea, Skaff says, not her own.
Not everyone had such a perfect time with their host families, or, 
like sophomore Britton Trimmer, a French and industrial manage
ment major, did not spend much time with them. Trimmer feels he 
became much closer to his fellow Carnegie Mellon students than to 
his host family. This sentiment was echoed among others as well, 
like sophomore professional and creative writing and French major 
Mandy Kinne and senior French and art major Hope Johnson.
Says Johnson, I liked my French family, I just didnt like living 
with them. I hated their killer, attacker dog ... French dogs are 
annoying, small, and yappy, and of her American friends, We 
became really, really close.
Everyones heard of the delicious food in France, and the students 
from CMU completely confirm the rumors. Kinne says, If you are 
going over there, prepare to gain weight!
Creamandbutter, creamandbutter, creamandbutter, laughs 
Johnson, re-adjusting to skim American foods.
To keep from inconveniencing her hosts, who put meat in almost

II memorial in Normandy.
everything they cooked, Skaff even gave up her vegetarian diet 
while in Tours. But Skaff, who stayed in France most of the holiday, 
has no complaints about her carnivores Christmas dinner, either. 
Turkey, oysters, salmon  it was terrific!
While the French food was delectable, the dance music was a little 
stale. French dance music sucks, Johnson opines. They play tons 
of American music ... from the Beegees to the Stones, to Jimmy 
Buffet. Their idea of danceable music, what they played in clubs, 
like their version of the Metropol, was the Doors and the soundtrack 
to Grease. Apparently, at one point in one of the bars they visited, 
the men lined up on one side of the room acting like the T-Birds, 
while the women lined up on the other, as the Pink Ladies.
Although the club scene was not as exciting as they might have 
expected, the nightclubs, bars, and cafs in Tours did provide 
wonderful opportunities for socializing and meeting students from 
a plethora of backgrounds. As Johnson points out, the local 
university in Tours has a campus life even less electric and more 
apathetic than Carnegie Mellons. In order for students to meet and 
get to know each other, they rely much more heavily on the social 
haunts of the area than on making friendships through classes. In 
this way students have an easier time meeting others from aca; demic disciplines different from their own.
Britton Trimmer/Special to The Tartan 
Carnegie Mellon students pass by the Hotel de Ville in the center of 
Tours, three blocks from the villa, every day.
Instead of lecturing facts, my pro
fessors lectured idea, idea, idea.  
____________ Senior Hope Johnson
Also, with the Institute de Touraine, an international school 
located in Tours which teaches the French language to students 
from around the world, and with CMUs Centre de Tours, the cafs 
provide the chance for people to meet other people from around the 
world, speaking a number of different languages, having grown up 
in diverse and unique cultures  an excellent opportunity for 
observation and growth.
Outside of Tours lies the rollicking and majestic continent of 
Europe. The American students in Tours were most grateful for 
their abundant travel opportunities and experiences, except Kinne 
and Trimmer, neither of whom decided to buy a Eurail pass. The 
pass, which enables people to travel by train to almost anywhere in 
Europe for one fixed rate, was purchased by most of the other 
students.
It was hard to hear the others say, Oh, were going into Paris for 
the day. Be back this afternoon. Or to see them leaving for Rome 
or somewhere  that was difficult, Kinne laments.
For those with the Eurail pass, travel was easy and usually 
thrilling. Trips to Amsterdam for its liberal drug laws are cited as 
a popular outing for many of the travelers in Europe, and weekend 
trips to Madrid and other cities were common among the Carnegie 
Mellon students during the semester.
One of Skaff s more exciting excursions almost brought her to the 
Matterhorn. She was kicked off the train before reaching Zermatt, 
however, because she had not paid the correct fare. Forced to find 
her way out of the middle of nowhere, and unable to find a road, 
Skaff began to scale the side of a nearby mountain. Fortunately for 
Skaff, who has scaled mountains before, the task was a fairly simple
one, until she started hearing what sounded a bit like coyote noises.
She glanced downward and saw a flock of sheep beneath her, and, 
glancing upward, saw a yodeler standing over her. At last reaching 
the top of the mountain, Skaff says she was frightened at first, but 
he did not prove to be dangerous. He did not speak any English, so 
he was unable to help her find her way back to a road, but Skaff 
sighs, At least he didnt kill me.
With that and several other stories of wild adventures in Europe, 
including marriage proposals from a man obsessed with the fact 
that she is American, SkafFs only complaint is that they did not 
have three-day weekends, like the students from Stanford had.
While the two-day weekend is a Carnegie Mellon convention at 
Tours, many ofthe other procedures originated duringthe Stanford ; 
University years. The curriculum is largely based on the curricu
lum worked out while Stanford occupied the villa, and the profes; 
sors are primarily those who worked with Stanford students before ; 
Stanford moved its program to Paris.
Dr. Larry Thacker, the director of International Education at 
Carnegie Mellon, explains, We tried to work with the most popular 
courses [that Stanford offered], and the best instructors.
In addition, one resident Carnegie Mellon faculty member goes to ; 
Tours each semester, and teaches a course that will vary from : 
semester to semester. Last fall the resident professor was Paul : 
Smith, teaching a class called Semiology, which takes the place of  
Discursive Practices, a core requirement for writing majors.
Of her professors, Johnson exclaims, They were excellent! They 
were incredible, I learned so much. The professors teach differently 
than American professors. In a way, she says, they are like high 
school teachers, who stand up in front of the class and lecture. But 
instead of lecturing facts, my professors lectured idea, idea, idea. 
It was really intellectually challenging.
Johnson was also impressed because the professors seemed much 
more interested in the intelligent things that could come from the 
mouths of students during discussions, than concerned if a paper 
was not turned in on time. Quantity of output was not as vital as 
quality of intellectual expansion and understanding.
All of the classes this year are taught completely in French, 
although only declared French majors are required to write their 
papers in French. This coming fall, however, the plans will change 
somewhat in order to accomodate students who might not speak 
any French.
While Stanfords French-based curriculum was a valid idea, it 
worked well for Stanford because they have a broader liberal artsbased student population. At Carnegie Mellon, students are study
ing in a variety of fields, which might or might not include French. 
And so, classes this fall will include history, political science, 
economics, and art history, taught in English, as well as the current 
French classes. Students will still be required to take one of the 
three levels of French language classes, but will not be required to 
speak French before entering the program.
Were hoping to open up the program to as many students as we 
can, says Emily Binchini, department program assistant for Tours. 
That way a larger number of students will be able to share and 
experience the culture and life of France.
And for those who have just returned, the time spent in Europe 
was one of the most rewarding and educationally fulfilling experi
ences in their lives. Kinne, Trimmer, Skaff, and Johnson all plan to 
return to Europe, to visit areas that they didnt visit last semester, 
or to re-visit areas they fell in love with. Skaff might spend one

summer babysitting Sylvie and Brunos three children.
Whatever their plans, the students in Tours were touched by a 
sense of realization that the world is as large in numbers, popula
tions, and varied cultures as it is small in basic human understand
ing, and communication that transcends language. The friendships 
and confidence that the students developed will probably stay with 
them for life, as will the lessons and memories they collected 3000 
miles away in Tours.
While in France, sophomore Britton Trimmer visited Chambord, the chateau of Louis XIV.

from around the world. It began 
before the end of the fall semes
ter and will continue until Feb
ruary 16. Its down the street at 
the Carnegie Museum of Art, so 
even if your laziness quotient is 
pretty high, its not a taxing trip.
After expending some small 
amount of energy to physically 
get there, you do need an open 
mind, or at least an active one. 
Looking back over the exhibit 
map in the brochure that comes 
with admission ($4 with a stu
dent ID), it appears that I went 
through the displays backward. 
I guess there really should be 
someone there to take the ad
mission tickets. Somehow 
though, I think that it all worked 
out for the better.
The International is an ex
hibit of recent, though not Mod
ern, art. If you go the forward 
route, you start out with the 
past and move into the present. 
No offense to the past or the 
canon, but thats all rather bor
ing.
What the real SMASH and 
BLAM Batman was famous for 
is in the International exhibit 
itself, not among the Carnegies 
more permanent collection. 
Rodin and Monet are great, but 
Ive seen them before.
Whats new is Craft Morphol
ogy Flowchart, a series of pho
tographs of handmade stuffed 
toys. The photographs hang on 
the walls and the stuffed toys 
lounge on folding card tables.
Art or not, they look like those 
things your great auntie made 
for you when you were six years 
old. Aside from stuifed animals 
and giant bronze Weeblesmy 
favorite piece  there are sev
eral multimedia presentations 
to take in.
For the computer enthusiast, 
check out Richard Hamilton in 
the International and Paul 
Glabicki in the Forum room on 
the first floor. Both have done 
some interesting work with com
puter graphics and art. I also 
recommend, if not completely 
understand, David Hammons 
Yo-yo, and although not my 
favorite, Stephen Prinas piece 
The History of Modern Paint
ing..., across the hall gets at 
least a BANG on the Batman 
Art-o-meter.
There are some points you
Stephen Prinas piece, The History 
of Modern Art gets at least a 
BANG on the Batman Art-o-meter
Should pay attention to when 
viewing the International ex
hibit. First, start from whats 
marked as the back in the ex
hibit map and work forward. 
Save all of the old stuff for the 
end when youre tired anyway. 
The displays at the real begin
ning are part of the Carnegies 
permanent collection, so theyll 
be around for a while if you dont 
get to it all in one day. Second, 
just stand and stare for a while. 
The pieces on display are the 
stuff thats being created now; 
its currently contemporary.
Some of it is trying to break new 
ground in the realm of whats 
artistic. Meanings may not be 
immediately apparent, but give 
them a chancethats what all 
the brochures say. Finally, check 
in all the nooks and crannies. 
Some of the multimedia installations run periodically. You 
dont want to miss anything be
cause you didnt hear the noise 
or see the flashing lights.
Next week, Ill check out the 
off-site exhibits at the Mattress 
Factory. So, stay tuned, same 
Bat-time, same Bat-paper.
Gym class or sado-masochism in disguise? You decide...
What? Winter breaks over? 
Thank god.
No, Im not crazy. Its just 
that after three winter breaks 
Ive come to realize that winter 
break is really annoying. You 
see, winter break is too short for 
you to be productive, and just 
long enough for you to become 
bored. In turn, you spend the 
break perfecting the science of 
vegging in front of the TV all 
day and being as productive as 
spore mold.
Well, I didnt fall into my usual 
winter coma this year. No, sir. 
This year was going to be differ
ent. This year I made sure that 
I cut back on my usual winter 
break TV viewing by at least 
one show (a week) and I made 
sure that I shifted my position 
on the couch at least every 15 
minutes (you can never get too 
much exercise). I also decided to 
go on a field trip over break so 
that I would get some fresh air 
and be reminded of what color 
the sky is.
So one bright winter morning 
[ hopped into my car, checked 
the color of the sky (blue), pulled 
out of the driveway, began 
thinking of new and exciting 
destinations, realized that I was 
missing Duck Tales, .immedi
ately pulled back into the drive
way, rechecked the color of the 
sky (blue> again), and quickly 
ran into the house. Sure, it was 
a short field trip, but its not 
quantity, its quality.
However, later in the week I 
decided to actually leave the 
neighborhood and go on a real 
[field trip. One with permission
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
slips and everything. So I got my 
mom to sign my permission slip, 
gave it to myself, hopped into 
the car, remembered that I was 
tapin g Duck Tales, and drove off 
into the unknown.
Somehow I managed to 
stumble upon my old elemen
tary school and immediately 
decided that this was the desti
nation of my field trip. So I pulled 
into a teachers parking place 
(hey, it was the only one left), got 
out of the car, and began stroll
ing up the main path, thinking 
of all the things I could do here
 I could see if any of my old 
teachers were still around, I 
could relive old memories, I could 
see how much of my graffiti still 
remained.
As it turned out, some of my 
favorite teachers were still there 
and even remembered me, with 
a little help.
Teacher: Stephen Glicker? No, 
sorry, I dont remember you.
Me: Dont you remember that 
student who used to crazy glue 
quarters to the floor and watch 
other kids get hernias trying to 
pick them up?
Teacher: Oh, yes! Now I re
member you!
Surprisingly, most of my graf
fiti was still around (If I was a 
dog and you were a flower, I 
would lift up my leg and give you 
a shower. A classic), and as for 
the memories ... they washed 
over me like a tidal wave. The 
gym, the playground, the old 
bicycle trails  and after think
ing about all those good times I 
used to have in those places, I 
realized something new and 
wonderful. I realized that when 
I was a little kid and innocent 
about the world around me, I 
was completely insane.
Now, I dont mean I was just a 
little insane. I mean I was a 
completely loony, crazy, stark 
raving mad little kid.
Of course, I also realized that 
all little boys are insane, so its 
really not all that bad in retro
spect. But what worries me was 
how on earth did I live through 
my childhood? And where did 
that insanity go?
Take gym class for example. A 
class where a hundred or so crazy 
little boys would be put together 
in a large room, with hard floors 
and walls, and be forced to play 
the most evil game ever imag
ined dodgeball. A game where 
the object is to hit a player on the 
other team with a ball as hard 
as you can. After playing this 
game around four or five hun
dred times Im still amazed that 
I didnt suffer from permanent 
brain damage.
Im quite positive that gym 
teachers invented this game be
cause only gym teachers are sa
distic enough to come up with
the logic behind dodgeball.
Gym Teacher #1: Wow, I 
thought up a great idea!
Gym Teacher #2: What?
Gym Teacher #1: How about a 
game where instead of us hit
ting the kids with balls, we let 
the kids hit each other with balls!
Gym Teacher #2: Wow! What 
a great idea!
Gym Teacher #1: And we can 
call the game hitball! No, wait, 
the parents might catch on if we 
called it that.
Gym Teacher #2: How about 
dodgeball?
Gym Teacher #1: Yeah! The 
parents would never catch ontothe cruel nature of this game 
with a name like that!
Gym Teacher #1 & #2 then 
begin to laugh like wild hyenas 
being tickled.
And so another great Ameri
can tradition was bom.
The playground was almost 
worse than gym class because 
on the playground we used to 
beat each other up voluntarily. I 
remember the favorite games 
we used to play back then were 
tackle football (there was no such 
thing as touch football) and 
the slightly chaotic spin-off, killthe-guy-with-the-ball, which is 
played exactly the way it sounds.
Of course, we would once in a 
while break away from these 
two traditional male bonding 
games and play capture the flag 
(tackle, of course) or kickball  
a spin-off from dodgeball which 
combined the sports baseball and 
hit him as hard a possible with 
the ball. However, these games 
were always passing fads be
cause they usually req,uired 
rules, thinking above the level 
of an amoeba, and didnt result 
in nearly enough life-threaten
ing injuries.
Finally come the bike trails, of 
which I have the most fond 
memories, and which prove that 
I was indeed certifiable. The 
trails themselves were fairly 
harmless, just hilly, winding 
trails through the woods sur
rounding the school. But where 
they led, that was something 
else altogether.
At the end of the trails was a 
large hill, or small mountain 
(depending on your prospective), 
and down this hill was a long 
dirt trail, filled with wet leaves, 
small dead animals (really! Im 
not kidding!), broken sticks, 
sharp rocks, big holes, and it 
was so steep that it was impos
sible to walk up without grab
bing onto nearby trees. But even 
though it was nicknamed the 
trail of death, every week, no 
matter what the weathec, my 
friends and I would ride our bikes 
down this trail. Yet, never once 
did I or any of my friends ever
get a single scratch.
I have to admit that the expe
rience of going down that hill 
was the most exhilarating feel
ing of my life, but the point is 
that after looking at that trial I 
realized something frightening.
I realized at that point that I 
wouldnt go down that same trail 
today. If someone asked me if I 
wanted to play no-rules tackle 
football in the mud with 50 guys, 
I wouldnt play. Some people 
would call this sanity, some 
people would call it maturity, 
but I call it a trade  a trade 
with your childhood and inno
cence. A trade with no refund 
and your only receipt is memo
ries.
However, if someone asked if 
I wanted to play dodgeball Id 
say, When?
Maybe theres still a little in
sanity left in me after all.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  20 January 1992L3
Winter Activities Fair experiences little activity
By LISA WILSON 
& SHARI MORGAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriters
It may have been the cold and 
blustery weather that deterred 
students from attending the 
Winter Activities Fair on Janu
ary 16, but there also seemed to 
be little student interest. The 
winter fair, sponsored by the 
Department of Student Activi
ties, was the first one to be held 
in a number of years. A total of 
about 60 organizations were 
represented.
Even though few students 
showed up at the event, many of 
the groups felt that the fair had 
potential and was a good idea 
for many reasons.
Fifth year architecture major 
Amy Blake, coordinator of the 
display, said, The Winter Ac
tivities Fair is an opportunity 
for freshmen students to become 
involved with many of the cam
pus organizations after having 
heard about their activities all 
of the first semester. It also 
gives winter transfer students a 
chance to become acquainted 
with all that the campus has to 
offer.
Senior architecture major 
Julie Reiker, Chairperson for 
Fringe, agreed with much of 
what Blake had to say. She added 
that by the second semester stu
dents, especially freshmen, 
know the flexibility of their 
schedules and have a better idea
about how much time they have 
for extra-curricular activities.
Senior physics major Njema 
Frazier, President of Spirit, said 
the only complaints that she had 
about the fair were that there 
was a short time period in which 
the organizations had to pre
pare and that the fair was sepa
rated into two different rooms, 
the Ballroom and the Wherrett 
Room, which might have caused 
confusion.
Freshman Mike Molnar re
marked that he was glad the 
Winter Activities Fair occurred 
because it allowed [him] to get 
a feel for the campus before [he] 
decided to commit to be part of a 
particular group.
The general consensus was
that the fair was a good idea, but 
because of the weather, the time 
notice, or the lack of student 
interest, this years Winter Ac
tivities Fair was not as success
ful as it might have been. If the 
idea is revisited next winter, 
perhaps more timely advertise
ment and organization might 
encourage more students to at
tend, and the Fair might fulfill 
its potential as a second-chance 
for campus involvement.

Cola companies hatch insidious plots
The new Pepsi cans, have you 
seen them? They look like some
thing straight out of the latest 
Star Trek movie. Think of it. Its 
the circular Pepsi icon pursued 
by a big red vertical line. If you 
drink Diet Pepsi, its even bet
ter, a series of thin, parallel lines. 
Its the Starship Enterprise. 
(Vaginal symbols chased by 
phallic symbols, dont ya know. 
'Is there anything more sexual? 
rThey should probably use that 
ifor the television ads.) The first 
time I saw it, I expected Kirk or 
Spock to materialize and take it 
back. Maybe the soda-pop ma
chine was a device secretly 
planted in Pittsburgh by histo
rians or anthropologists from the 
future to observe ancient life on 
earth. They just forgot to take 
 out their Pepsi cans and replace 
them with ones 1990s America 
is used to. You know, the ones 
that say uh huh! Those future 
academians just gave us the 
wrong ones ... baby. Here, in 
Pittsburgh. Call Orson Wells, 
quick.
The new cans even say that 
theyre collectors editions. Is 
it just a clever ploy to get con
sumers to take them home to 
,the mantle so secret cameras 
.can get a look at our home lives? 
Or maybe were supposed to put 
.them into that comer of the bed! room where we keep prized pos\ sessions so the future can study
 our mating rituals. Four hun\ dred years from now we could all 
be on the Discover Channel in 
; positions we dont usually take 
I in public.
! Now, I havent watched so 
many bad science fiction movies 
to actually believe what Ive said.
; Who would forget to change the 
; cans? Seriously though, the new 
:cans do look like something 
straight out of science fiction.
DRAGGED, KICKING 
AND SCREAMING, 
INTO ...
by Bob Dixon
Was it just time for Pepsi to get 
a facelift? Was it a clever mar
keting device to piggy-back the 
next Star Trek movie? Was the 
next Star Trek movie released to 
coincide with the new cans? 
(Pepsi announced the new de
signs for the cans on September 
23,1991. Star Trek VI opened in 
theaters on December 6,1991.)
One way or another, the new 
designs do contain something 
that appeals to our sense of the 
future. The new look contrasts 
the design which is being re
placed, the ones with uh huh 
pasted across the front. Ray 
Charles promoted the old pack
ages in television commercials, 
playing a piano in what looks 
like an old speak-easy. Is the 
new design a decision to dump 
nostalgia in favor of the scien
tific possibilities of the future? 
Is Pepsi moving America into 
the 21st century by redesigning 
its package? Perhaps the one 
thing that remains constant, in 
both the speak-easy and on the 
Starship Enterprise, is Pepsi 
Colas circular red and blue logo.
Whatever the reason, I really 
dont want to be dragged into 
the future by a soda-pop com
pany. I wouldnt mind looking 
like the people in ads-who drink 
Pepsi, and frolicking around
some beach or bar with other 
attractive people who drink 
Pepsi. Id even enjoy listening to 
a little music in a speak-easy 
with Ray Charles; itd be better 
than Bill Cosby giving me a Coke, 
some Jello, and a little dance. 
But somehow I dont really like 
the idea that a company which 
puts two servings of its product 
into one can is shaping the fu
ture. (If a serving is only six 
ounces, then make the can hold 
six ounces, not twelve.)
Isnt the job of shaping the 
future supposed to belong to edu
cation? Isnt that what everyone 
keeps saying? Isnt the future 
supposed to be in the hands of 
the educated young? Isnt that 
one of the reasons we all go to 
school to learn, to take charge of 
the future and make it better 
than today?
So, who decided Pepsi Cola, or 
at least Pepsis marketing de
partment, could do a better job? 
I dont know, but it wasnt me. 
Well probably find out when the 
election campaigns start in ear
nest. Then well see whos to 
blame for everything political, 
economic, social, and cultural 
thats gone awry. This year itll 
probably be El Nino. All I know 
is that even if I dont stop buying 
Pepsi, I wont put the can on the 
shelf over my bed.

JFK questions history
By TIM BLASS -----------------------------------------------------
Tartan Forum Editor  Movie Review 
History is a pack of lies.
 Bishop William Stubbs
History is past politics and politics 
present history.
 Sir John Seeley
JFK stands as possibly the most 
talked about and debated film of recent 
times. How can one not ask the ques
tion that has perplexed, dismayed, and 
ultimately frustrated the American con
science: Who killed President John F. 
Kennedy?
Through the eyes of Jim Garrison, a 
New Orleans district attorney, played 
by the mercurial Kevin Costner, we 
trace the criminal investigation and 
then, the only trial of the assassination 
of John F. Kennedy. Garrison begins 
his crusade to challenge the accepted 
story about the murder and three years 
later he pieces together an intricate 
tale through a variety of eye witnesses 
and physical evidence. Finally, Garri
son charges Clay Shaw, a New Orleans 
businessman, with involvement in the 
murder of the President, but fails to

adA cy /co1udoi
gain a conviction. Along the way Garri
son becomes deeply obsessed with ex
posing the inconsistencies he finds in 
the official government investigation.
Beyond the movie itself, much of the '
controversy surrounding the movie !
stems from the method by which Oliver !
Stone blurs the line between fact and I
personal interpretation of history. 
Stone, noted for his work in Born on the 
4th of July, Platoon, and The Doors, 
tackles yet another aspect of the turbu
lent Sixties: the assassination of the j 
charismatic, well-loved President ofthe 
United States.
For most, the assassination comes 
from history lessons we grew up believ
ing; John F. Kennedy was shot and 
killed on November 22, 1963. Lee 
Harvey Oswald was arrested, ques
tioned, and held for further question4wtaot ott kNGi baRt \ep

Tartan Staffwriters
I Juice is reality. It tells of life, 
friendship, love, hope, dreams 
fa'erred, hatred, and death. It 
 the story of four longtime 
Wends facing the decision of 
Whether to play by the rules of 
We system or against them in 
order to make it in this cruel 
Jvorld. The conflicting forces of 
"e come thundering down on 
he audience only to halt with a 
'hud in our laps.
This Paramount film, prouced by David Heyman and 
1 eal Moritz, features rising tal

tinct personalties add something 
special to the film.
Q (Epps) is an amateur deejay 
working the New York circuit. 
He enters various contests in

Emilio Estevez races into the 21st century in Freejack
By STEPHEN GLICKER
j^artan Magazine Editor
After watching the science fic
tion action film Freejack I felt 
.. I felt sad because Freejack 
was a good film. The acting was 
the good, the music was good, 
the action was good ... every
thing was good in Freejack, ex
cept the plot, which was great. 
This, in turn, made me quite sad 
as I left the theater.
Freejack had such potential of 
becoming a classic science fic$on action film if only the actmusic, action, and everyftiing had been taken that one 
step farther. Freejack was close 
to becoming another Robocop, 
Terminator, or Alien, but instead 
it ends up being yet another 
good science fiction action film.
The plot might sound silly on 
paper, but works quite well on 
the big screen. Emilio Estevez 
plays Alex Furlong, an up-andcoming race-car driver whose car 
explodes in the first five min
utes of the film. However, Fur
long does not die, but instead is 
projected instantly into the year 
2009.
! Of course, like so many other 
good science fiction action film s 
the future is bleak and polluted, 
where people openly carry guns 
and arent afraid of using them.

Tthough this future of doom 
can be found in so many of these 
films today, Freejack is a lot more 
convincing that most of those 
films, but not quite as convinc
ing as Robocop or Total Recall.
Furlong quickly escapes his 
captors and tries to find his way 
around a familiar, but obviously 
very different New York City. 
Meanwhile, hes being pursued 
by a bounty hunter, or bonej acker as theyre called in the 
film, named Vacendak (Mick 
Jagger).
Eventually Furlong manages 
to locate his girlfriend, Julie 
(Rene Russo), whos now 18 years 
older. She explains to him that 
technology has become so ad
vanced that they can now elec
tronically implant one persons 
mind into another persons body.
However, because of the ter
rible conditions on the planet 
(eg. pollution), healthy host 
bodies are impossible to find. So 
they reach back through time
and capture healthy, young 20th 
century bodies the moment be
fore they die, so there is no para
dox created. Furlong is one of 
those bodies (called Freejacks) 
and hes already been pur
chased, except he doesnt want 
to give up his body just yet.
The rest of film is filled with 
chase scenes, more chase scenes, 
and even more chase scenes. 
Theres even a really good car 
chase scene, which could have 
been a great car chase scene if 
only the director didnt use an 
extremely obvious and annoy
ing blue-screen behind the ac
tors.
As for the other ten or so chase 
scenes, theyre all good, theyll 
keep you interested and awake, 
but they probably wont blow 
you away or be remembered a 
week later.
The acting is pretty good, es
pecially Estevez, who fits the 
character of Furlong quite well, 
which is fortunate, because 
Estevez is in this film a lot. Sure, 
hes the star and all, and maybe 
it was my imagination, but it 
seemed like he was always on 
the screen.
Jagger, who hasnt been in a 
film for over 20 years, during 
the first half of the film just 
seems like your standard cookiecutter bad guy. But after he
meets and begins talking with 
Estevez, Jagger manages to 
break the basic bad guy image 
and becomes more three-dimen
sional in nature and does a cred
ible acting job.
Russo seems like your stan
dard tough on the outside, nice 
person on the inside heroine at 
first, but manages to expand her 
character, like Jagger, through 
her scenes with Estevez.
Probably the biggest star in 
this film, as I mentioned before, 
is the plot. Not only is the basic 
plot very interesting, but all the 
subplots and the unbelievable 
number of twists, turns, crosses, 
and double-crosses keep you 
awake and watching the film.
However, a misplaced scene 
here and there, some really bad 
blue-screening, a goofy line or 
two, and the whole effect is ru
ined. If only the producers had 
had a little bit more money, the 
actors had been little bit more 
talented, and the editing a little 
bit tighter, Freejack may have 
been considered a must-see 
film.
Instead, all I can say about 
Freejack is that its a sure-youshould-see-it-but-dont-getyour-expectations-up-too-high 
film. And dont be surprised if 
you leave the theater a little 
sad.Mick Jagger is futuristic bounty hunter Vacendak in the film Freejack

The movie opens with havoc

parents. They get ready for a

But such is the average day for 
these boys  to them jobs are a

The plot is slow to evolve, in 
fact, 45 minutes into the movie, 
we were still searching for one. 
The only thing those minutes 
established was the struggle of 
many young black men in the 
inner city. In the words of Bishop: 
All we do is run. I feel like Im 
on the goddamn track team.
When a plot does appear, it 
quickly develops, and disappears 
just as quickly. Basically, the 
guys decide to rob the store 
owned by an immigrant who 
clutches his gun whenever 
blacks come into the store. The 
funny thing is  he operates in
a black neighborhood. This re
sults in the snowball effect of 
multiple killings, increased ten
sion between friends, the 
breakup of a shaky relationship 
etc., etc.  typical movie stuff.
Just when the frenzy of events 
seems too much to bear, the 
movie comes to a screeching halt. 
In its path it leaves a few dead 
bodies and a lot of unanswered 
questions. Surely one would as
sume that the culmination of 
violence and heartache would 
teach us a lesson, but none was 
to be found. The film only rein
forced many stereotypes about 
blacks. There wasnt even a hid
den message ... no matter how 
hard we searched for one. The

Cradle balances out with 
effective storyline and actors
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Contributing Editor
Prepare for a deluge of the 
word Hitchcockian in the near 
future; it seems that the sus
pense thriller is back in style. 
Valued for their low budgets as 
much ag anything else, suspense 
films are the growth industry 
within the motion picture field. 
But are there enough fresh ideas 
out there?
If The Hand That Rocks The 
Cradle is any indication, the 
answer to that question is yes. 
Although the movie sacrifices 
some complexity to be simple 
enough for the average movie
goer, Cradle still offers a clever 
plot and enough suspense to keep 
the viewer involved for the twohour ride.
The story begins when motherto-be Claire Bartell (Annabella 
Sciorra) files a sexual harass
ment complaint with the state 
medical board against her gyne
cologist. When four other women 
come forward with lawsuits, the 
doctor decides to kill himself. 
Uiifortunately for Claire, the 
story isnt over, but just begin
ning.
You see, the doctors wife (ReMovie Review

becca DeMornay) not only be
comes a widow, but suffers a 
miscarriage soon after. Decid
ing that its all Claires fault, she 
decides to get revenge by taking 
over Claires family. Assuming 
the false name Peyton Flanders, 
she manages to work her way 
into the Bartells house as the 
live-in nanny.
Now that Peyton is in place, 
she goes to work on the family. 
Claires baby is the easiest to 
convert; a few secret breast
feedings and little Joe is con
vinced that Peyton is Mommy. 
Emma, the daughter, is the next 
person to fall to Peytons charms 
(the scene where Peyton muscles 
a boy whos been picking on 
Emma is delightfully evil), and 
finally Michael (Matt McCoy), 
the father. People that Peyton
cant convert disappear, and bad 
things start to happen to Claire, 
even further undermining her 
position as the woman of the 
house.
Eventually, Claire is able to 
figure out the mystery, leading 
to the inevitable final confronta
tion. Peyton goes over the edge 
(like she wasnt there already) 
and the battle royal ensues in 
the Bartell household. Natu
rally, Man/Protector Michael is 
down for the count, leaving the 
two women to slug it out for the 
kids. Who wins? Well, this is 
Hollywood. Take a wild guess.
The first way in which Cradle 
differs from most films is in the 
use of strong female characters. 
DeMornay is naturally going to 
be tough  the psycho always 
has to be but Claire, who 
seems meek on the surface, is 
able to rise to the occasion when 
needed. Claires friend, Marlene, 
is the one who figures out 
Peytons secret, and even little 
Emma gets a chance to be brave 
once Peyton starts going Bartell 
hunting. Michael, the only ma
jor man in the film, is a non
factor even before Peyton fixes 
his wagon.
The acting is also solid, esperahhMt6 rFTa./stda Vista Pictures Distribution'

daily DeMornay. Sciorra does a 
goodjob as Claire, although shes 
so frail early on that its a little 
hard to believe it when she comes 
through at the end. The rest of 
the cast gets the job done  
nothing special  but those 
characters arent supposed to be 
as memorable as the Dueling 
Moms.
The only major breakdown in 
Cradle is that its a little con
trived. Former ghostbuster
Ernie Hudson appears as 
Solomon, a retarded man who 
does painting around the Bartell 
home. The simple mind of 
Solomon can see the truth 
through Peytons scam, so 
Peyton has to get him out of the 
way. Marlene figures out the 
mystery by wild coincidences (a 
set of wind chimes that anyone 
could own that are less than a

JFK, from page L13
ing when he was gunned down by Jack 
Ruby while a national television audi
ence witnessed the shooting.
; The murder of Oswald eliminated 
any hope of ever determining what in
volvement he truly had in the assassi
nation. The Warren Commission, es
tablished by President Johnson to in
vestigate the Kennedy murder, con
cluded that Oswald was the lone gun
man who killed the President. How
ever, the thrust of the movie questions 
the Warren Commission findings.
! JFK has an ensemble cast including 
renown Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, 
Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Jack 
Lemmon, John Candy, and Donald 
Sutherland. Costner, as Garrison, 
brings to the role a fire and intensity of 
feeling that radiates into the audience. 
At moments, Costner is constrained by 
the script from revealing the complex
ity of the man that would try to shine 
light upon the secrets of the assassina
tion, but he remains a most convincing 
guardian of American ideals, if longwinded at times.
Kevin Bacon turns in a surprising 
performance as a male prostitute. He 
openly and defiantly wears his heart on 
his sleeve, lending credibility and depth 
to the minor role. Also, Joe Pesci plays 
one of the conspirators, David Ferrie, 
andmakes his despicable character 
seem vulnerable and afraid for his life
the JFK assassination. Unfortunately, 
Stone moves too slowly in the progres
sion of the story, resulting in a three 
and a half hour movie which has the 
audience wanting to believe anything 
just to have the movie end  soon. 
Stone freely admits to altering se
quences of events and the time frame of 
the discovery of pieces of evidence to 
produce an understandable movie, but 
this detracts from the second objective 
Stone pushes for: acceptance of a spe
cific alternative view of the assassina
tion. Classified as a full-length feature 
film JFK really comes down to being a 
docudrama.
Leaving the theater, questions rang
ing from Was the assassination a coup 
detat? to Was Oswald a patsy? to 
Did Castro or the Mafia order a hit on 
the President? kept running through
my head. Although Oliver Stone makes 
some directorial mistakes he hits the 
bullseye by convincing the viewer that 
there may actually be some validity to 
alternative explanations of the JFK 
murder. This is quite a challenge for a 
director considering the great resis
tance to revisions of history to clear up 
the matter.
JFK raises new questions and hope
fully new answers. It is only too bad 
that Oliver Stone prefers a media trial 
to the court of law to present facts.

Human nature blossoms in The Hothouse
By MARY YEE
Tartan Staffwriter
In our world, we have names 
for every object. Choosing which 
word is appropriate for an idea 
or object is a matter of context 
and degree in many cases.
CFA alumna and teacher 
Laurie Palmer uses the orchid 
as a powerful tool for integrat
ing this concept. As she says in 
her exhibit, The Hothouse: The 
Orchid Room, at the Hewlett 
Gallery in the College of Fine 
Arts: The orchid is an elusive, 
omanticized, over-protected, 
extravagant, expensive, my
thologized, elitist, difficult, and 
sexy plant or else it is none of 
these things, except as we project 
them onto it. Upon examining 
ad orchid, one is amazed by its 
beauty. However, the mystery 
ofits survival and the invisible 
elements in the orchid's envi
ronment such as humidity, ven
tilation, and temperature pro
voke one to project these extrava
gant characteristics of romance 
and desire upon the flower.
Like most exotic plants, or
chids are grown in controlled 
environments to allow them to 
mature properly. Palmers ex
hibit is one such enclosure. Upon 
enteringthe exhibit, one encoun
ters a video screen projecting an
image of an orchid. There is no 
furniture in the dimly-lit square 
room, which sets off the image 
on the screen. At one point, the 
orchid in the set appeared to be 
moving. Upon viewing it again, 
the flower seemed to be a still 
picture frame. Perhaps the ob
server has a desire to imagine 
this movement of the lifelike 
orchid in the projection. The or
chid is displayed in the exhibit 
so that the observer is forced to 
pay attention to it and study the 
characteristics of the flower in 
more detail.
Expand this idea to CFA or 
the University as a whole. Sud
denly, one realizes that enclosed 
atmospheres can provide the 
surroundings for development 
and adaptation to changes out
side the environment. As Palmer 
explains, The College of Fine 
Arts can also be seen as a con
servatory, not only in terms of 
teaching music, but also as a 
place of growth, where minds, 
talents, and ideas are cultivated 
in a sheltered environment un
til they can become self-suffi
cient. Carnegie Mellon and 
other educational institutions 
develop curricula for their stu
dents. Depending on their ma
jors, students take courses in 
the curriculum to prepare them 
for the real world of careers and 
independent life. The skills and 
ideas one obtains are assets in 
the role of independence and 
creation of an individual.
Orchids also are viewed as ob
jects of desire because of their 
mysterious beautytheir color, 
their shape, their scent  but 
this desire is rarely entirely sat
isfied. Yet, it also awakens hu
man sexuality and ones goal to 
strive to the climax of the inten
sity of love. The orchid is the 
thing we have lost or are afraid 
of losing (even if we never had it) 
[orchis: from Greek -> testicles] 
and that which we consequently 
reach towards,says Palmer.
Dreams provide another me
dium for people to fulfill this 
desire. We all have certain hopes 
and goals we set for ourselves.
Some of them are never realized 
because we never had the oppor
tunity, while others have been 
forgotten. Like the orchid, de
sire is a combination of fantasy 
and imagination which people 
cannot live without. It is this 
field of fantasy which sparks the 
fire for inventors, writers, art
ists, and individuals to cross the 
line and reach over to create 
the reality. In order for people to 
continue their existence and 
strive to fulfill their desires, a 
form of continuity must occur.
Continuity evolves through 
people who absorb the creators 
ideas or desires and add their 
own. This challenges others to 
use their creativity to produce 
newer and improved innova
tions. Our society today needs 
more incentives from our gov
ernments and ourselves to con
tinue this trend of innovation to 
move ahead in the economy. The 
fantasies of today can be the 
realities of tomorrow.
Palmer explains her interest 
in her art form: My work is 
fueled hy an interest in making 
visible the fluid and unstable 
nature of our world, while cel
ebrating this fragility, and the 
capacity for adapting. This oft 
ten involves surrendering a cer
tain amount of control to pro
cesses that I initiate and frame.
Kevin Chen/Tartan Staff Photographer 
An example of the orchids in Laurie Palmers display
However, consider the reality of 
the situation in which humans 
are always trying to control the 
instability of our nature. Or
chids you see on the market are 
merely artificial creations of 
human breeding as tools to con
trol the characteristics of color, 
height, or endurance to the en
vironment.
Means of control apply to many 
things outside of the orchid. 
Gardening plants and arrang
ing them are other aspects of 
controlling nature. Think about 
all the advertisements youve 
seen about psychics who fore
tell your future. People seek to, 
control the unknown. It is an 
inevitable action. Environmen
tal control is another area whichpeople are trying to confront and 
solve. Yet, weather reports just 
forecast the news; earthquakes, 
are still occurring with lives lost,, 
Why must we control nature, 
when it continues to rebel? Per-, 
haps control is an innate and 
essential quality that will never , 
ease the pressure, always en-, 
couraging humanity to question 
and explore. Like the orchid we 
are always blossoming always 
growing towards perfection.
Univer styC gains U2 fans attention with unique style
By ELIZABETH CHAMBERS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I have to admit, Ive always 
been a little scared of things 
that Im not sure how to pro
nounce  that goes for food, 
;es... and albums. But there 
comes a time when you have to 
throw your fears out the window 
and take a chance. So I bought 
U2s latest somewhat 
unpronounceable album Actung 
Baby.
Actung Baby, consists of 
twelve love songs. I use the term 
love song loosely, because 
Actung Baby is not made up of 
sappy declarations of ultimate 
devotion and admiration. 
4ctung, which is German for 
attention, is a collection of 
>)ongs which present the reality 
of relationships. Although the 
language is poetic, lyrics such as 
Her skin is pale like Gods only 
dove/ Screams like an angel for 
your love/ Then she makes you 
watch her from above/ And you 
need her like a drug. from the 
song So Cruel, describes the 
raw emotion rather than the 
processed poetry found in Hall
mark cards.
 Record Review  
???V2 ACTUNG BABY. By U2.
Even though the single One 
seems like its destined to be
come -one of this years love 
songs, none of these tracks will 
ever end up on one of the For 
Couples Only albums that are 
sold late at night on television.
There is a certain style to ev
erything U2 does and Actung 
Baby takes this characteristic 
and pushes it to the limits. With 
the help of producer Daniel 
Lanois and the engineering work 
of Flood, the band has added a 
lot more in the frame of technol
ogy to their music. U2s songs 
used to rely on the vocals and 
the guitar, but Actung Baby uses 
a different sound in each track, 
which only adds to the individu
ality of the album. The wailing 
guitar riffs are almost nonexist
ent on this album with the ex
ception of such songs as The 
Fly. Guitar strings that were 
once ripped away at are now 
subtly strummed.
Also, in the past, many of U2s 
hit songs such as With or With
out You, Sunday Bloody Sun
day, and Where the Streets 
have No Name, had a very 
strong dependence on the vo
cals. Although the lyrics of songs 
such as Ultraviolet and Even 
Better Than The Real Thing on 
the Actung Baby album are very 
strong, U2 has focused less on 
Bonos voice and paid attention 
to the instruments. In the 
albums first song, Zoo Station, 
Bono, who sounds like hes sing
ing through a telephone made 
out of two tin cans, is a compli
ment to the strength of Larry 
Mullens drums.
The strong dependence on po
litical topics has also vanished 
on this latest release. The politi
cal statements that have become 
such an integral part of Bonos 
career are only present in the 
jacket, which urges listeners to 
write to three places; 
Greenpeace, Amnesty Interna
tional, and of course, U2.
With the new musical path 
that U2 has ventured down, they 
have managed to produce an 
exciting ear pleasing product. 
So no matter how you pronounce 
it, Actung Baby is definitely 
worth some attention.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  20 January 1992
Bad TV programs sometimes show promise
Bad TV programs dont bother 
. me, as long as theyre supposed 
to be bad. A subpar show that 
excels in its badness can actu
ally be pretty enjoyable.
Take Charles in Charge. Scott 
Baio and friends raise stupidity 
to the level of art. The charac
ters are so inane, the situations 
so unbelievable, and the writ
ing so inferior that we end up 
Expecting very little from 
Charles and Buddy. This sitcom 
is essentially a half-hour of mind 
rot, which is not necessarily an 
unenjoyable experience.
Even Mr. Belvedere can be 
enjoyable. I mean, look at the 
cast. Ilene Graff is no Lucille 
. Ball, and Bob Uecker doesnt 
. compare to Bill Cosby (or even 
' to Alan Thicke, for that matter). 
And Christopher Hewett, no 
matter how hard he tries, will 
never match the performance 
; of, say, William Frawley on My 
; Three Sons. This is a standard 
; sitcom family with below stan; dard actors. Anyone with half a 
: brain could see from the outset 
: that this show wouldnt bring 
home any major awards.
Still, we expect stupidity, lots 
of it, so when someone says 
something funny on Mr. Belve
dere, or when an emotionally 
charged scene actually seems 
emotionally charged rather than 
: embarrassing,we are im
pressed. The program, a show
case for below average talent all 
the way around, has exceeded 
our expectations. Its easy to get 
enjoyment from a really bad 
show.
What disappoints me most are 
bad shows that are supposed to 
be good, shows that should be 
terrific, but end up leaving a 
funny taste in my mouth. When 
I expect something bad, getting 
something mediocre is a pleas
ant surprise. But when I expect 
something good, average just 
doesnt cut it.
Two sitcoms currently on the 
air fit this category: Anything 
But Love and Davis Rules. I have 
tuned into these shows, expect
ing something worthwhile, only 
to come away disappointed. The 
worst part is that I wont give 
up. I keep on going back, blindly 
I believing that this week, theyll 
get it right, theyll hit their 
 stride. Hasnt happened yet, 
unfortunately.

THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
lost cause. This Jamie Lee 
Curtis-Richard Lewis sitcom 
debuted a couple of years ago to 
a big fanfare. It hopped around 
the schedule a bit, never found a 
big audience, and was eventu
ally canceled by ABC. Irate pro
tests from loyal viewers brought 
it back, again to low ratings. 
ABC stuck by it for another sea
son and a half, even though the 
audience never grew. Finally the 
company that produces the 
sitcom canceled the show, as
serting that Anything But Love 
would never gamer a profit from 
syndication sales.
And theyre probably right. It 
took the production company to 
do what ABC should have done 
a long time ago: cancel a show 
that just isnt that good. Any
thing But Love has lasted this 
long based solely on its poten
tial. It had the ingredients for a 
major hit: talented and likable 
leads, a quirky supporting cast, 
and a great time slot following 
ratings winner Doogie Howser, 
M.D. For some reason, though, 
it never clicked.
Its hard to say why Anything 
But Love never worked. In the 
beginning, the chemistry be
tween Marty and Hannah was 
fantastic, but the supporting 
characters provided little more 
than background. Slowly, the 
supporting cast improved and 
the writing got better, but the
stars roles seemed to become 
less defined. In a last-ditch ef
fort to gain audience, the writ
ers made Hannah and Marty a 
couple. The result? We now 
have The Richard Lewis Show, 
where the funny man delivers 
one-liners while Curtis laughs. 
Indeed, a once independent 
Hannah has become little more 
than Martys woman, cooing 
over her honey at every oppor
tunity.
I admit that I am guilty of 
defending this sitcom in the past, 
based solely on what I hoped I 
would see rather than what I 
actually saw. But now it has 
degenerated enough for me to 
give up hope and bid it a much 
overdo farewell.
While Anything But Love is 
anything but alive, Davis Rules 
(Wednesday at 8 pm on KDKA2) still has a chance to live up to 
its potential.
Randy Quaid plays widower 
and high school principal Dwight 
Davis. The show focuses on his 
life at school and at home, where 
he lives with his children, his 
sister, and his father. The real 
star of Davis Rules, however, is 
Jonathan Winters. The veteran 
comedian portrays slightly se
nile Gunny Davis as a man liv
ing in a warped, and much fun
nier, world than the rest of us. 
The highlights of every episode 
are Winters inspired mono
logues and stories, which he 
seems to make up as he goes 
along.
Im sure Im not the only one 
who wouldnt mind watching 
Winters wander aimlessly 
around the kitchen and mutter 
to himself for thirty minutes. 
Unfortunately, Winters is but a 
secondary character in Davis 
Rules. Most of the other characters are just plain silly, and the 
best they can do is give a con
fused smile when Gunny goes 
into one of his routines.
The problem is not that Win
ters is too weird; rather, the rest 
of the characters are too darned 
normal. They all need to catch 
some of the otherworld crazi
ness that Winters possesses. 
When all the characters have 
Winters* traits Davis Rules will 
stand out.
There is hope. This season saw 
some cast changes that seem to 
have brought the quality of the 
show up a notch. First of all, 
Dwights sister, Gwen, moved in 
with the family. Played by 
Bonnie Hunt, Gwen provides an 
admirable foil for Gunny; the 
banter between Dwight, Gwen, 
and Gunny borders on hilarious 
at times.
Secondly, oldest son Robbie 
was shipped away to boarding 
school in a My Three Sons move. 
It seems likely that we wont be 
hearing from Robbie again. Re
placing him is Skinner, a teen
ager staying with the Davises 
while his parents are finding 
themselves in South America. 
Skinner is a con man a la Danny 
Partridge, smooth yet eminently 
likable.
The two younger boys havent 
done much to stand out yet, but 
with any luck, theyll turn out 
weird. Once the rest of the fam
ily adopts Gunnys slightly tilted 
mentality, this show will be a 
pleasure to watch.

Of course, its also quite pos
sible that Davis Rules will fol
low the route of Anything But 
Love, fixing what isnt broken 
and changing too much. I hope 
not, because while theres not 
much worse than a good show 
thats bad, theres nothing bet
ter than a good show thats great.
AndifDavis Rules flops? Well,
I might decide to limit myself to 
shows that wont disappoint me. 
Scott Baios a regular on Baby 
Talk now, and my expectations 
couldnt be lower. Maybe Ill 
tune in.

DJ spins tales on new records
By SEAN GOLLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
collection is complete without 
this.
Slightly older (in the clubs, 6 
months is ancient!), yet just as 
fast and techno is Eons Fear: 
The Mindkiller.This tune starts 
out with a chilling vocal intro: 
Fear is bom of the devil. It has 
no beginning and no end... then 
proceeds to launch itself into a 
mindless beat sprinkled with 
vocal samples from the movie 
Dune.
Another club classic wend
ing its way back into clubbers 
hearts is the third remix 12" of 
Mobys Go! Diehard club fans 
should remember this techno 
tune that uses the same sample 
as Ministrys Nature of Outtakes. Four more mixes grace 
this piece and particularly hot 
on the floor is the Rainforest 
mix.
You may have noticed a spe
cific musical genre presenting 
itself, and the next piece is no 
exception. N-JOIslatest release, 
Mindflux, has four songs on it 
that drive your bass like never 
before. The title track well de
serves its name as it takes you 
on a technohouse rollercoaster. 
Also, some clubbers may remem
ber Malfunction, as it appears 
on their last release Anthem.
On the B-side are two strong 
cuts as well  Phoenix and 
Rhythm Zone that prove with
out a doubt that N-JOI are the 
masters of the dance floor.
You may have noticed a defi
nite musical genre presenting 
itself, and this next track is no 
exception. Praga Khan, part of 
the near legendary Lords of Acid,
has a track out that has no equal. 
Kick Back for the Rave Alarm 
epitomizes the new rave style of 
music that has swept Europe, 
combining incredibly fast techno 
with the best elements of house, 
rap, and even metal(!). If youve 
never heard of rave and want to 
find out, this is the track to snag.
And speaking of the Lords of 
Acid, theyve got a new single 
out as well, Take Control with 
the B-side Lets Get High. Defi
nitely a solid piece with both 
tracks standing out well, and
continuing the repuatation gar
nered by these Belgian new beat 
fiends with I Sit on Acid.
Now you may be reading all 
this and wondering, how can I 
hear all this great music, while 
living on a college students bud
get? Well, wonder no more. Just 
check out the radio show the 
Techno Terrorists, every Friday 
night from 6pm to midnight C6 
hours of continuous dance mu
sic). All this and more can be 
found on WRCT 88.3 on your 
FM dial.
I dont care what anybody tells 
you. Its HARD to be a club DJ. 
People whine at you, asking you 
to play the latest Hammer (mi
nus MC) single or the new C&C. 
Youre trying to mix and cant 
hear anything because you went 
deaf a half an hour ago. You 
spend every last dime you own 
on the latest tunes, which is why 
Im here now. Christmas break 
was good to me, and I just picked 
up a few new tracks to spin with.
Techno music is a new wave of 
style that combines a driving 
beat and keyboard that ranges 
anywhere from being hauntingly 
complex to being somewhat 
primitive yet exciting at the 
same time.
First on the list of new techno 
tracks is What Can You Do For 
Me by the band, Utah Saints. 
This track will grab you and 
never let you go. Not much in 
the lyrics department (but then, 
the best ones never do), mainly 
the warbling strains of a diva 
and a few vocal samples. Annie 
Lennox and David Stewart (late 
of the Eurythmics) both helped 
out with this techno-house tune 
thats destined to become a club 
anthem across the country.
Next is a hardcore techno jam 
by L.A. Style, proclaiming loudly 
with a driving beat that James 
Brown Is Dead. No house mu
sic on this track! Five mixes ap
pear on the vinyl, cassette, or 
CD single, all of which can make 
you drop from exhaustion on the 
dance floor. No technofiends

Leningrad Cowboys 
Go America
' The Beatles completed a successful musical in
vasion in 1964 when they appeared on The Ed 
Sullivan Show. England must have recognized 
their talents if they encouraged them to come to 
America. In the fictional film about a band from 
Leningrad, such is not the case.
A small band with overemphasized dippety 
doo hairstyles and outof-tune songs is abhorred 
by music lovers. The public and the bands man
ager push the group to leave their hometown be
cause of this lack of musical talent. So the band 
^packs up their things, confident that they will be 
pjwelcomed into America with open arms.
. For a touch of culture, bad hairdos, and indefin
ably bad music, head over to DH 2210. Remember, 
a buck couldnt get you in to see The Beatles.

Dead Again
Everyone should spend about two hours, at the 
edge of their seat, trying to decide who is going to 
piall who and who has killed who in Dead Again.
The movie begins in black and white, with one of 
the two characters portrayed by Kevin Branaugh 
informing us, This is far from over. The movie 
then switches to the present, now in color. Kevin 
Branaughs second character is a private eye who 
has been asked to determine the identity of a 
mysterious woman who has amnesia.
An antique dealer suggests that hypnosis might 
help this woman recover her memory. What they 
discover is that they may all be reliving a murder 
which occurred in their past lives! 
t Though every indication is that someone will 
oon be dead (again), Branaugh and his client are 
falling in love and are determined to make their 
situation work out the second time.

Naked Gun 2 1/2
Lt. Frank Drebin, played by Leslie Nielsen is 
concerned with the environment this time around. 
A world famous professor who has found cleaner 
ways of producing energy is kidnapped by wasteful 
energy companies managers seeking to protect 
themselves from future financial distress.
Although the movie has some very funny mo
ments, like a spoof of the clay/sex scene from Ghost 
and Nielsens constant terrorizing of Barbara Bush, 
the jokes just arent as funny as they could be. The 
movie is supersaturated with too much dumb hu
mor.

Indiana Jones and 
the Last Crusade
If you want to see a movie with nonstop action, 
excitement, and comedy then Indiana Jones and 
the Last Crusade is the movie to see. Although it is 
a sequel to the movies Raiders of the Lost Ark and 
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, it is not 
just a rewrite of the first two films.
Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones, the 
archaeologist who always likes to steal the prize 
and get away in one piece from the dangers that 
chase him. Sean Connery is his historian father 
who has the map to the Holy Grail. Together, 
father and son seek it out. Watch for the tests they 
must pass in order to get through the maze, and 
how danger brings Indiana and his father to 
speaking terms.
Dont consider this movie a sequel, consider it an 
equal.

"No, but there are no taste 
buds on your penis."

'There's nothing left for 
me to hide.
You took my ignorance,

What a shame to throw 
away so much, so suddenly.
So sad.
