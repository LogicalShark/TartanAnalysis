BASEBALL & TRACK PRACTICE 
INVENTORS CLUB MEETING.
On Saturday last the Tech base-ball 
team left Pittsburg to play at St. Vin
cents College, located near Beatty 
station, 011 the P. R. R. The day was 
fine, and better weather could not have 
been wished for, but the team ate 
rather heartily of a large dinner, and 
consequently was in no condition to 
play fast ball.
The game opened with Tech at the 
bat, and Dawson, after being allowed 
one ball, slugged the latter for a 
nice, easy home run, making the sec
ond home run in two years on the 
St. Vincents groundso we were 
told. This event naturally took some 
of the starch out of the St. Vincents 
team, but they soon rallied and pro
ceeded to pile up a high score.
Pitcher Burnside for Tech, for some 
reason refused to play with cleats on 
his shoes, until too late, and conse
quently missed a few bunts which re
sulted in runs. In the seventh in
ning Halferty saved the Tech team 
the disgrace of a walkovsr by catch
ing a difficult fly in left field with two 
men on bases. This resulted in a 
neat double play, and was well ap
plauded by our opponents.
Burgnam played a star game at 
short in the first part of the game, 
but was unfortunate enough to stum
ble and fall twice when attempting 
to catch a runner at first in the last 
part of the game. Catcher Barkley 
was not up to his usual fine form, for 
some reason (we suppose he ate too 
much), and let two or three runs in 
which might have been checked. 
Tech had a little the worst of it in 
regard to umpiring, also. Line-up:
(Continued on page 2.)
On the evening of April 25th and 
part of the following morning, the 
class of 1911 held a banquet at the 
Nixon restaurant.
There were forty students present 
with Dr. R. H. Holbrook and Mr. 
Connolly as the guests of honor. 
Director A. A. Hamerschlag sent a 
letter of regrets which was read be 
fore the speaking began.
The banquet room was profusely 
decorated with flowers and plants, 
and a generous sprinkling ot Tech 
pennants advertised the fact that it 
was a Tech function.
The committee is deeply indebted 
to Mr. W. P. Field for hiskindness 
in procuring for them the use of the 
large banner used by 1911 in the 
Founders Day parade, and a vote of 
thanks was extended him at a meet
ing held just after the festivities were 
brought to a close.
Mr. Hays, as toastmaster, was re
sponsible in great measure for the 
success of the affair and it was by 
his tactful and witty remarks of in
troduction that most of the speeches 
were delivered as easily and free 
from restraint as they were.
In his, the opening address, there 
were many good points which are 
sure to be remembered by all who 
heard them, but which space alone 
prevents inserting in this column.
It is not within the bounds of pos
sibility to express in cold type the 
affectionate and reverential regard 
with which Hayes referred to our 
director and to Uncle Andy.
Mr. Stamm, who followed Mr. Hayes 
on the program, made a few remarks

; on the subject of Class Spirit. Mr.
Stamm said in part and with cutting 
emphasis:
| Class spirit is not that spirit which 
moves a man to accept a position in 
the executive, financial or recording 
departments of the class and then 
fail to appear at the class meetings 
or fail to even send regrets to a func
tion like this. Neither is it that 
spirit of vandalism which prompts a 
body of men to destroy, hinder or mo
lest the social functions or institu
tions of a senior class or to cast in
sinuating sneers and insults at a jun
ior onebut it is rather that spirit 
which moves a man to perform to 
the best of his ability the duties of 
any office with which he has been 
honored; it is that spirit which moves 
a man to sow the' seeds of peace and ! 
harmony where discord exists; that 
I ever tends to fraternal tolerance of 
one anothers failings and outspoken 
appreciation of our fellows virtues.
Mr. C. S. T. Edwards and J. A.
Lonergan, Esq., favored the guests by 
well-chosen and well delivered selections.As to the addresses of Dr. Holbrook 
and Mr. Connelly, they must have 
been heard to be appreciated.
President Howley gave a general 
talk in his quiet, convincing way and 
did much to stir up the enthusiasm 
which marked the whole evening.
Short addresses were made by all 
the guests and without exception 
every one responded to the call with
out demur.
On the whole the affair was a huge 
success and a fitting close to a suc
cessful years work. Harmony and 
class spirit was the key-note of the 
whole affair, and many and varied 
were the compliments passed upon 
the work done by the committee in 
bringing to a successful issue the 
first banquet of the class of 1911.

JUNIOR PROMENADE.
Preparations for the Junior Prom
enade are going on rapidly, and as 
we go to press the outlook seems 
more promising than at any previous 
time. The wives of the professors 
who will act as patronesses on the 
occasion are taking up the work with 
zeal, and it is hoped that every 1908 
man will do his share by giving his 
assistance to the committee.

NOTICE TO JUNIORS.
The Junior Promenade Committee 
suggests that the several engineering 
societies of the school each select a 
corner of the dancing hall and decor
ate it with their insignia and colors 
on Prom, night. If each organization 
would aid in this manner, it would 
partially solve the decoration problem 
and be an unique feature as well.

ATHLETICS.
Don't forget the Interclass Field 
Day at Friendship Park on Saturday, 
May 4, at 1.30 P. M.
If you cannot attend the above 
event from press of business perhaps 
you will find the ball game with 
Penna. State Reserves a little more 
interesting.
Wake up, Juniors, dont let the 
Plebes have everything in the Field 
meet.
Unfortunately Pitcher Wills missed 
the train on Saturday.

VARIOUS KINDS OF EDUCATION.
The following is taken from an ad
dress at the annual dinner of the 
Cornell University Alumni at Chi
cago:
Humanity is composed of all kinds 
of men, possessing widely different 
temperaments, tastes, and abilities.
It is well they are not all alike.
Any man will achieve the greatest 
effectiveness-when given the opportu
nities and training which develop his 
native powers. Any other training is 
liable to stunt his growth. His vari
ation, as he progresses in develop
ment, should be in the direction in 
which he tends to vary. This assists 
in the survival of the fittest; the sur
vival of the unlike, the survival of the 
effective.
Manifestly there must be as many 
types of education as there are types 
of men, and fortunately the number 
is not so great but that they can be 
readily supplied within any univer
sity.
So long as all men during the pro
cess of education were confined to one 
channel, those whom the channel pre
cisely fitted were greatly benefited. 
Those for whom the channel v/as a 
misfit were injured, for the reason
that during the most important for
mative period of their development 
their native power to vary was re
sisted, their minds forced away from 
their natural trend, and energies 
which could have been potent for 
good in certain directions were 
dwarfed by the compulsory exertion 
of uninteresting, unproductive effort. 
This results in that kind of mediocrity 
which is stagnation.
You can* make anything good of 
a man except to make him better in 
that which he is. You cant unmake 
him and make him over again.
If it be argued that a man must 
needs have the so-called liberal edu
cation in order to be well rounded, 
following this with the so-called 
specialized courses, the answer is 
that he can be forcibly made well 
rounded like a billiard ball without 
other characteristic than roundness.
He ought to have corners, and the 
corners should be left on to dent 
something.
As to the so-called specialized 
courses, these are only names. They 
are no more special than the human
ities. Some are scarcely so highly 
specialized.
The older I get, the more I think 
that there is no such thing as liberal
2
education, liberal arts, or liberal any
thing, as distinct from specialized de
partments of knowledge.
Liberality is the free and equal ad
mission of all.
We have heard too much about 
knowledge for its own sake versus 
knowledge for use. All knowledge is 
for use. All education is for action. 
The engineer uses machines and ther
modynamics in a certain direct way. 
The architect uses art and construct
ive knowledge in a similar way. The 
lawyer uses his knowledge in a less 
material way.
The classical or philosophical man 
uses his acquirements in a different 
way, but if he does not use them they 
are useless
All education is liberal 01* all is 
technical according to our definitions, 
but all is for use.
When it is observed that less than 
25 per cent, of the students follow 
classical pursuits when left free 
choice, and that over 75 per cent, 
select pro.essional and industrial 
education, there is good reason to be
lieve that this is about the proportion 
in which mens minds are fitted to 
receive benefit from the acquirement 
of the respective classes of knowledge 
and training. I therefore maintain 
that, instead of a decadence in the 
humanities they are elevated because 
their representatives are men whose 
minds are fitted to take such educa
tion, and who will therefore conspicu
ously represent the best possibilities 
of classical training applied to those 
to whom it is adapted.
Likewise by processes of natural 
selection the other departments will 
have graduates who are conspicuous
ly strong because their best efforts 
will be put into that which they can 
do best. I know of nothing pointing 
more directly to success than that.
It is not necessary to consider the 
relative merits of the various kinds 
of education. There is room for all, 
because there are all kinds of men. 
It is useless to say, I am better than 
thou, or this is better than that. But 
one thing is better than everything 
else, and that is the broad spirit 
which recognizes that all education 
is equal, that training is training 
whenever you find it, knowledge is 
knowledge, no matter of what it con
sists, that human effort is human ef
fort, no matter to what it is applied, 
and when it has singleness of purpose 
 and is resourceful, it is effective.

Be sure and dont forget to cook the

The Glee Club is progressing won
derfully and working hard these days. 
They are a credit to us and we are 
anxiously looking forward to the 
time when after we are installed in 
the new building, they will give some 
concerts.
Just lately the girls have been 
practicing vigorously at dancing. At 
noon hour the floor is crowded and 
some even stay after school. Some
thing is evidently going to happen.
The new gymnasium was opened 
the other day by an informal dance. 
The decorations were beautiful; the
music was fine and the guest list 
was strictly limited.
Miss Law says that Germany has 
increased in climate and population.
Too bad, girls, that we were not 
allowed to teach the boys the gentle 
art of dancing.
Girls, there is simply no news for 
the Tartan this time. Fall out of a 
window, somebody, or do something 
to make some news.

GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS 
CONCERT.
On Thursday night last the Avalon 
Borough Hall was the scene of a very 
enjoyable concert, given by the Tech 
Glee and Mandolin Clubs, under the 
auspices of the Brotherhood of the 
Avalon Presbyterian Church. Fully 
four hundred people attended and 
many others who had bought tickets 
were only prevented from going by 
the inclement weather.
It was the last concert of the sea
son and perhaps for that reason the 
fellows put more life and vim into 
their music than usual, and that the 
audience appreciated the snappy 
swing with which it .was sung, was 
evident from the number of encores 
it called forth.
The String Quartette played ex
ceedingly nice numbers, as also did 
the Mandolin Club, the pieces played 
by both showing the effect of many 
hours of practice.
