a little greater than that required 
for two full scholarships, the money 
having been contributed by alumni 
and friends and distributed to wor

Average Student 
Studies 21 Hours
Toronto Professor Reveals 
Time Statistics
"Twenty-one decimal four hours 
per week is the average amount of 
studying done by the students of 
this university, stated Prof. S. N>
F. Chant, of the University^ of 
Toronto. This figure was gained 
A by having every student in his 
glasses account for how every minvtc~ of time was spent for two 
-/iVccks. The account was recordlvv\l on a special form and handed 
ini to the Psychological Depart
ment.
Uarger groups of students were 
cxajinined in the Universities of 
Minnesota and Ohio, and it was 
four\d that the number of hours 
stud:/ per week averaged 21.3 in 
each? school studied. Practically 
eveny student in the whole of 
Yale) recorded his coming and go
ing, imd there 20.8. hours were spent 
in st>udy. The averagestudying 
time) of a group of from twenty 
to tHiirty thousand students was 
founcX to be twenty hours. In the 
various universities accounted for, 
only lone exception in time was 
. ./4ound|. This was in Iowa State, 
whiVe the college town is noted 
for its lack of outside interests.; Its 
hours of study amounted to 30.1 
per week.
"The no grade students seem to 
agree everywhere in not working," 
said Professor Chant. He pointed 
out that those who just scrape 
through only study about 16 hours 
a week, while those with B and 
VC grading average 22.9 hours per 
week.
"The average working week, 
study and lectures together is 33 
hours. A few have 48 hours. Thus 
university work is far from being 
heavy enough to be detrimental to 
t he health, concluded Professor 
Chant.
A student at Carnegie is expect
ed to spend a number of hours at 
school work corresponding to the 
number of units in his ourse. 
Anyone carrying 55 units averages
22 hours of classes per week and 
is supposed to spend the 33 hours 
remaining to fill his quota, in. out
side study.

Scholarship Organization 
to Sponsor Benefit 
Performance
PRICES $.50 TO $2.50
Tickets Will Be Sold At 
Booths Soon After 
Registration
The Womens Scholarship Or
ganization will sponsor the first 
Pittsburgh appearance of Angna 
Enters, famous mimist and dancer, 
at its annual benefit to be held at 
Carnegie Music Hall on Monday 
evening, February 29.
Because of her versatile presen
tations, Miss Enters has been re
ceived enthusiastically in New 
York, London and Paris. She 
creates her own compositions and 
designs unusual costumes, which 
increase the effectiveness of her in
terpretations. Oliri Downes, critic 
for the New York Times, says:1 
Angna Enters is one of the most 
gifted and imaginative dancers that 
the American public has seen in 
late seasons. She is to be thank
ed for new' ideas and the inspira
tion with which she provides a 
jaded public.
Miss Enters is better known1 on 
the European stage than in Pitts
burgh, but her appearance in this 
city is an event of genuine the
atrical importance. The London 
Era says: Actress, dancer and su
preme mimic in one. An aston
ishing artist with, a distinguished 
and superior talent, According 
to the New Yorker, "Entertain
ment is her business and she 
knows her business.
'"No definite date has as yet been 
announced for the campus sale of 
tickcts, but the sale will begin 
shortly after registration. As in 
previous years, booths will be 
placed in the various schools to 
facilitate purchases. The prices will 
range from $2.50 for orchestra 
scats to 50 cents for balcony seats.
The Womens Scholarship Or
ganization is composed of one rep
resentative from every activity on 
the campus in which women par
ticipate. Every year the organiza
tion presents a, theatrical benefit, 
the proceeds of which are used to 
award scholarships to deserving 
candidates in Margaret Morrison 
and Arts school.
Ruth Brooks, President, has ap
pointed the following girls as com

Announces New Pledges
At a Scarab meeting held on 
Tuesday, January 12, eight new 
men, chosen for their outstanding 
work as well as for their good 
character, were called and pledged

custom of Scarab to make two 
calls' during the school year. The 
first call takes place near the end 
of the first semester and the sec
ond call during Campus Week. 
This time Scarab pledged the fol
lowing men: S. Okeson, A. Mc

Instructors Season Justice With Mercy
When They Make Out Final Examinations
We dont make exams difficult; 
all we want is to find out how 
much the student has gained from 
the course, instructors answered 
as we questioned them on the way 
their various department^ make out 
the universally feared and respect
ed finals, which soon make their 
semi-annual , appearance. Rather 
uncertainly, we asked how exams 
are made; we feared such question
ing might be impertinent with mid
years scarcely a week away. Our 
fears were foolish, for the instruc
tors were very kind and helpful; 
Mr. Gocghan, thinking wc were his 
students gave us sample copies of 
past exams and asked sternly if we 
hadnt listened to his lectures. Be
coming assured that wc sought 
only general information on the 
making of exams, he gladly told 
us how he does it.
' Goeghan Limits Answers f 
Mr. Goeghan asks very definite 
questions and limits his students to 
very definite answers of five or six 
lines. While he thinks the opin
ions of his students on the aes
thetic value of art, sculpture, and 
architecture may be quite interest
ing, ^ he does not feel that these 
opinions have much value to him 
on examinations.
Dr. Sclioeh says that the psy
chology exam is made out to test 
students on their familiarity with 
significant scc.tions of the text 
book. Objective tests are used , so 
that the element of language may 
be eliminated, because this exam 
is not on the use of language, but 
on the acquisition of factual ma
terial. There wont be any catch 
questions among the innumerable 
true and false statements which 
will make up a large part of the 
exam. The difficult parts of the 
exam arc the parts which make it 
a fair one; allowance must be made 
for the varying abilities among 
students.
Math Department Says
Even in those terrifying math 
tests, there is no conscious attempt

PROM AT FORT PITT HOTEL BALLROOM
Frances Liquor Snoopers Protect Wine 
Industry, Declares Dr. Ross in New Book
France, as well as the United 
States, has liquor snoopers, reveals 
Dr. Ross, of the Department of 
Economics, in a recently published 
book. In this work, which is en
titled Governmental Protection of 
the French Wine Industry, lie 
makes a study of governmental 
stabilization of French wine pro
duction and traces the course of 
wine prices in their reactions to 
adulteration, false branding, crop 
variation, and other economic fac
tors.
According to Dr. Ross, the 
French government employs more 
than a thousand agents and furnishes them with more-than forty 
laboratories for the chemical anal
ysis of suspected wines and liquor. 
In France, however, it is excessive 
water content, not alcoholic con
tent that leads to suspicion, seizure 
of evidence and chemical analysis.
The merchant tlvat cuts his wares 
with water may be a hero to the
Anti-Saloon League in America, but 
in France he is just a jail bird if 
his activities fall under the sur
veillance of the governments wet 
agents. They sleuth from cafe to 
cafe sampling wines and carrying 
away bottles to their apartments 
for further sampling and prelimi
nary analysis with portable chemi
cal apparatus. Needless to say, 
there is no, dearth of applicants 
for these positions.
Whenthe preliminary analysis 
shows excessive water content or 
other adulteration the evidence 
goes to one of the forty govern
ment laboratories for confirmation 
and the prosecuting attorney hails 
the offender into court for viola
tion of the French Pure Wine 
Laws.

monial to the great international 
paradox of the age, namely, Pro

Dean A. Tarbell Leaves
Mount Mercy Hospital
Dean A. W. Tarbell, who was 
injured during Christmas vacation, 
returned to his home Sunday to 
recuperate. He was struck by an 
automobile while crossing the cor

on Sunday evening, January 3. 
His injuries were more serious 
than expected at fir^t by his phy

to the hospital for a longer period.
Hard Hit Highway Hoboes Hold School of
Higher Learning Called Howe University
Something -new in the line of 
institutions of higher learninghas 
been established in New York City 
by a recent convention of hoboes. 
The' knights of the road are lay
ing plans for the establishment of 
a hobo college, which will eater 
exclusively to hobo students.
Inspired by lofty motives of edu
cation along lines particularly in
teresting to their daily life, the box 
car riders plan to name the new 
institution the James Eads Howe 
Memorial University.
The ,boys will start out in a 
modest manner. They plan to 
rent one floor of a building at the 
nominal sum of $35 a month. This 
space will house the administrative 
offices, which will include a wel
fare department, the classrooms, 
and no doubt the plodders of the 
rails will install gymnastic facilities 
for keeping their timber-walkers /in 
first-class condition.
The seriousness of the undertak
ing is evidenced by the fact that
distinguished educators have been 
invited to give lectures before the 
hobo students. No doubt travel, 
geography, cooking, transportation, 
dieting and diplpmacy will be the 
majors of the curriculum.
Present plans do not call for stu
dent publications, but it is likely 
that the Hoboes Meal Ticket 
will soon be found among the col
lege newspaper exchanges. The 
future students already have their 
fraternities, and rushing season will 
probably take a prominent place in 
the activities. Of course, athletics 
will have their place, and no'doubt 
the college will have championship 
cross-cquntry and track teams.
A glee club would be quite ap
propriatethe future students al
ready have many orignal .songs and 
plenty of strong voices. The Hobo 
Prom and the Weekly Banquet will 
likely be big features of the cam
pus life.
There is nothing like preparing 
oneself for the future.

PITT-CARNEGIE BASKETBALL TONIGHT IN THE GYM; PLEBES BEGIN PRELIMINARY AT 7:15 P. M.TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
DELAWARE U.-CARNEGIE 
SWIMMING MEET IN TARTAN 
POOL, FEBRUARY 13.
TONIGHTS RESULTS in the court game with Pitt will 
decidc whether Carnegie can have another crack at the city
title. At best, a win over the Panthers would open the road to
a three cornered tic, provided Duquesne suffered a relapse. 
But from the Tartan preformances of last week this opportun
ity has no door upon which to knock.
EAA DUKE! SOCICIT TO 'EM," and 
so they did; and we must hand "it" right
back to' them for their classy, deliberate de
feat of the Plaid tossers last week-end. Their 
fast passing attack and air-tight defense was 
as good an exhibition as has been staged in 
the Skibo Gym for sdme time. The fact that 
four Duke players are sophomores, and the 
fifth a third-year man should put the Bluff 
schoolwell up in the basketball world before 
long.* * * *
THE FIRST YEAR FIVES of Duke and Carnegie stole 
the spotlight as far as exciting games go. The Plebcs had things 
sewed up at the half time, but the Duldcts ripped through with 
one of those famous fourth-quarter rallies that gave them a 
five-point margin.A chance to break even with the Panther Frosh presents 
itself this evening in the preliminary game.* i * * *
ALTHOUGH THE BOXERS' have but two more per
formances in the home ring, these matches being with Bucknell 
on February 27 and Pitt on March 12, they will celebrate the 
closing of exams a week from next Saturday with a lively con
test in the Yale arena at New Haven. The Elis are in the habit 
of producing a team of the average college stock, and the inter
sectional rivalry will add to the interest of the fray.
Coach Sesto and his squad expect to register their initial 
victory of existence in their match with Yale. This thought 
is entirely within reason for the Skibos have the experience of 
two more matches, and the addition of a capable man in the 
165 pound class gives them an even chance. None other than 
our co-captain-elect of football, George Kavcl, appeared in 
Fridays workout. His maneuvering in a bit of shadow boxing 
supported his reputation gained in independent boxing before
entering school. George seems in fair shape and will very like
ly1 make his debut at Yale.
Pitts 'J: to 3 decision over the West Virginia boxers is a 
bit misleading for those who attended the bouts arc still won
dering how the Panthers managed to eke out a victory. Well, 
this is just one of the matters that will be straightened out 
when our city rivals come to blows with the home team.* )(< >K *
SOMETHING FURTHER in the way of intercollegiate 
boxing is in store for fans of the Pittsburgh district. If Mr. 
Ovcrcnds plans materialize there will be teams from Carnegie, 
Pitt, W. Virginia, W. & J., Duquesne, Bucknell, Temple, 
Georgetown, N. Y. U. and Navy meet in a tournament in the 
Tartan Gym about the middle of March. These results would 
serve as the preliminary eliminations for the Olympic team.
But plans for an annual boxing tourney between the first 
four schools have been under consideration for some time, and 
it is rather certain that this will take place regardless of the 
Olympic tryouts.H H< H .>k
COACH IWSEDORPHS TANKERS will get their first 
real test of the season when they, encounter the swimming 
team from the University" oi Delaware on February 13. The 
easterners ire in the habit of taking their swimming seriously, 
and will arrive with every intention of repeating last years 
victory,As mlb y D
CARNEGIES UNI-IEARLDED RIFLE TEAM upheld 
the dignity of the Plaid winning columns by virtually shoot
ing a defeat into the score books of Pitt and West Virginia. 
This was all in the course of a triangular match held in the 
Skibo range last Saturday. The superiority of the Plaid shoot
ing is found in the wide margin of 31 points over the Moun
taineers, and 63 points over the Panthers out of a possible 
total of 1,500. Scherba, Bcckert and Painter, shooting for Car
negie, outscored all entries.*., * * *
PLANS FOR INTRAMURAL WRESTLING arc proceed
ing with the thought that fraternities, dormitories, and inde
pendent groups are eligible to enter teams in the competition.
A team can .have eight men, each competing in his own weight 
class so that a difference of over eight pounds does not pre
vail between any two competitors. Several weeks of training 
will proceed the matches, and those interested will find in
struction on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons in the Gym.* * * *
A HANDFULL CDF HOCKEY HOUNDS put in an ap
pearance at their meeting last week. Nothing definite has been 
decided, but their is a slight chance that the candidates might 
get in a few practice sessions this season. It seems that there 
should be more skaters available than those who showed up at 
the meeting. Any new talent should report to Tom Coulter.

TARTAN CAGERS 
ENGAGE PTT
Tonight the gala event of pres
ent basketball season takes place in 
the Carnegie Tech Gym. It is 
none other than the annual PittTech contest. In the first game 
of the two game series, the Pan
ther upset the dope bucket by 
trimming the Tartans. This time, 
however, Coach Hogan and his 
men arc out to. get revenge for 
the last defeat, and believe it or 
not, the Panthers arc going to be 
in for a tough evening.
With the exception of Radabaugli, the entire Tartan squad will 
be in good physical shape for the 
game. Pitt, no doubt, will be able 
to present their best material for 
the game. It is rumored over in* 
the Panther Camp that Albright, 
last years ccnter for Pitt, will be 
available for the game. If Albright 
is ready it will mean one more ace 
for Doc Carlsoji. That doctor cer
tainly must have a pack of aces up 
his sleeves, for in the last game 
lie uncovered a ccnter who almost 
won the game for him. Person
ally, wc would rather see Albright 
in there instead of Brown; he cant 
do as much damage.
Dukes and Geneva Win
This last week proved to be one 
of the most disastrous in the pres
ent floor campaign, from Carnegies 
viewpoint. Two games were lost 
and none won. Geneva took the 
measure of Carnegie on Monday 
night, the score being 35-32. Sat
urday night the Duquesne Dukes 
came over to our Gym and put up 
such a defense that the Tartans 
had difficulty in getting a shot at 
the basket. The final score1 was 
29-14.
Geneva came here with a good 
passing, fast team.' Toward the 
end of the half they ran up quite 
an advantage on the Plaid five. In 
the sccond half the Tartans carricd 
on a rally which at one time 
brought them to -within one point 
of their opponents scorc. How
ever, the visitors once more spurt
ed into the lead never to be over
taken. The last five minutes of 
the game were very interesting 
with Carnegie trying to overcome 
a lead and Geneva working just as 
hard to maintain it.
On Saturday night Duquesne vir
tually eliminated Carnegie from 
the city championship by handing 
the Tartans, a 29-14 setback. Of 
course, the .Duk$shad a .fine team, 
a clever offense, and a tight dc 
fcnse, but even at that the game 
should not have been so' one-sided. 
The team' certainly seems to be in 
a . slump. Defensively the team is 
playing quite well, but the offense 
doesn't seem to function. Wc cer
tainly, hope they snap out' of their 
depression by this evening.
FRESHMAN TEAM
PREPS FOR PITT
The curtain chascr on tonight's 
basketball card is going to be a 
mighty battle when Coach Ncasc's 
yearling? oven up affairs with the 
Pitt Cubs. The Pitt lads gave the 
Plebcs their first defeat of the 
season, 'which is plenty to fight 
back for, and, besides that, it was 
far from a decisive victory as it 
was. The teams arc very evenly 
matched, and the local five is 
plenty anxious to discount the 
slight edge for the Gold and Blue 
after the first tangle.
Since the last time the two 
teams' played, Pitt has won two 
games, while the Skibos have won 
one and dropped one. Last Jan
uary the Duquesne freshmen show
ed just too much power for the 
Plebes. At one point in tlic game 
the Plebcs had a two-to-one lead 
over the Bluffs by a 16-8 scorc 
only to see the visitors start hit
ting the basket with machine-like 
accuracy. The sight of the first 
defeat after 27 consecutive wins 
must have spurred the Dukes on 
to this amazing rally to end the 
game 31-26 in their favor.
In last Monday nights  game, 
the Tech boys had little trouble in 
winning from the Geneva Reserves 
by a 25-19 score. In both of last 
week's games, Carlson and Ewalt 
have played outstanding basketball 
at forward and center. Beers at 
the other forward and Milim at 
guard have been playing a mighty 
consistent game.

Varsity Trackmen Enter 
W. Virginia Indoor Meet
With the Carnegie sportlight more or less monopoliz
ed by the various winter 
sports, Tom Coulter and a 
small band of varsity track 
men arc, nevertheless, train
ing faithfully for the Fourth 
t Annual West Virginia Indoor 
Meet in Morgantown on 
February 13.
The Indoor Meet is the 
.argest and nipst important 
Df its kind in this section 
ind the competition which 
~arnegic must buck includes 
the best track stars from 
such schools as Michigan,
Gcorgcto.wn, Penn State and 
others. Track is very highly 
patronized in West Virginia, 
and this meet is "the so
cially athletic high light of
the late winter season.
This years delegation df
Skibo track men will be head
ed, of course, by Tom .Coul
ter, versatile captain, who
plans to compcte in both the 
70-yard high and low hurdles. 
Artie Sigmund, Tartan speed
ster who was ineligible last 
year, will enter the 70-yard 
dash and the broadjump. Ray 
Barger, cx-captain and holder 
of the school -polc vault rec
ord, will compcte in his event 
against the usual formidable 
array of tri-state vaulters. 
Blaine in the shot put and 
Ralph Merten in the high 
jump arid broad jump, rounds 
out 'the Carnegie indoor rep
resentatives. Of this group, 
Coulter and Barger made the 
same trip last year.
The meet will serve to give 
Coach Guy Halfcrty a line on 
which will probably be the 
nucleus of this year's track 
team, as well as affording the 
runners their first taste of 
competition.
Little is known of the op
position, except that it will 
undoubtedly be the, toughest 
that Carnegie will have to 
face this season, and all the 
points garnered by Tech will 
certainly be earned.
The varsity swimming team has 
been working diligently over there 
in the tank, preparatory to their 
coming meet with the University 
of Delaware on February 13. Noth
ing is. known of Delawares strength 
cxccpt that they belong to the 
Eastern Intercollegiate swimming 
league and can be counted upon 
to test Carnegie to the limit.
The night previous,to their meet 
with the Tartans, they engage Pitt. 
This latter meet will afford Coach 
Ricdorph a line on Delaware as 
well as a .comparison of Pitt and 
Carnegie. In order to be eligible 
to compcte in the Estcrn Intercollcgiatcs, Carnegie must meet at 
least four league teams and Dela
ware will be the first.
The remainder of the swimming 
schedule is as yet, quite indefinite. 
The meet with New York U. has 
been canceled and no contest 
has been arranged with Pitt as yet. 
Other engagements of the light 
schedule arc equally dubious.
Last weeks easy victory over 
Wooster gave Coach Riscdorph lit
tle information about his team that 
he did not already know. As Tech 
walked off with every first, none 
of the Tartan athletes were extend
ed. At the last report, Ranny Boy
er is still resting on his newlyacquired laurel of school back
stroke ..champ, and Pal Miller is 
determined, in the next meet, to 
repeat his record times of past 
practices.
Sharpshooters
Defeat Pitt, W. Va.
The .Carnegie Varsity Rifle Team 
defeated Pitt and West Virginia in 
a three-way match here last Satur
day.
The Plaid squad continue to up
hold their reputation as being, one 
of the leaders in the sport in this 
section, of the country. The three 
highest scorers of the meet were 
also the high men for the Tartans 
with Scherba scoring 286, Bcckert 
285, and Captain Painter 282, These, 
scores are out of a possible 300 
made ff.Oiji the prone, kneeling and 
standing positions.
This meet marks the sccond en
counter of the present year. The 
first was a meet sponsored by the 
National Rifle Association in which 
'Carnegie placed second.
Much of the succcss of the rifle 
matches is due Colonel Fairley for 
his aid in arranging the sccnc of 
the contests. Buddy Ovcrcnd, 
too, had much to do with the 
proper equipment of the Skibo 
squad.
The indications arc that the com
ing match with Penn State or 
February 27 will arouse much in
terest among rifle enthusiasts.

The scorcs turned in this week 
for the first, tlgraphie match of 
the season indicate that the Wom
ens Rifle Team of Carnegie Tech 
should have a very, successful sea
son. Of course, there is room for 
improvement in many of the 
scorcs, but it is believed that many 
of the girls, especially the Fresh
men, will show a decided increase 
in accuracy as the year progresses.

Grues Aus Russland
A warning was recently sounded 
by those who know against the 
emigration of American labor to 
Russia. Many American workmen, 
despairing of national employment, 
have been impressed with the glow
ing (?) offers of the Amtorg, the 
American representatives of the 
U. S. S. R. These offers include 
the guarantee of the same privi
leges enjoyed by Russian workmen. 
These privileges may be regarded 
as such by the ex-mujiks, but cer
tainly would not appeal to the 
American working class.
The first privilegV^ accorded to 
foreign laborers is social insurance, 
which, by the way, amounts to 
about four roubles a day. These 
roubles, however, arc worthless 
outside of Russia. Secondly, the 
added inducement of a short stay 
at the Soviet owned and operated 
recreation centers at small ex
pense to the workmen. These 
camps are represented, even by the 
Russian workmen, as being decid
edly not quite the thing, so far as 
sanitation, food and medical atten
tion is concerned.
The third extra added attraction 
is the right to allow the workers 
children to attend the Soviet 
schools. This, of course, is a mat
ter of personal choice. Most Amer
icans, however, would probably 
think twice about exposing their 
children, in their most receptive 
years, to the extremely intolerant 
views of a class of people who arc 
distinctly at odds with the system 
under which the American working 
man flourished and waxed fat be
fore the present depression, which 
oddly enough, seems to have hit 
Russia itself so hard that it has 
become ncccssary to draft a bigger 
and better five-year plan.
So it would seem to be advisable 
to think carefully, and ask the ad
vice of someone who knows before 
signing up for any work in Russia.

FOR THE LOWEST COST 
AND GREATEST EASE
Set your date for after 8.30 P.M., and take ad
vantage of the low Night Rates. (A dollar call is 
60c at night; a 50c call is 35c.)
By making a date, the folks will be at home. Thus 
you can make a Station to Station call rather 
than a more expensive Person to Person call.
Just give the operator your home telephone num
ber. If you like, charges can be reversed.

Washingtons Birthday 
Dance Comes Next
Even the great arched windows 
of the huge gymnasium seemed to 
reflect the gayety /arid color that 
prevailed within as*the party spon
sored by the Night Student Coun
cil progressed.
The usual merry, carefree, but 
orderly gathering filled the gymna
sium to capacity, and everyone 
seemed to sense the spirit of the 
occasion, mingling freely among 
themselves and forming new ac
quaintances.
Dancing was not the only diver
sion,' however, as several couples 
were observed playing a friendly 
game of bridge on the bleachers, 
which were, by the way, erected 
for the basketball games, a factor 
that was responsible for the non 
too slippery floor that may have 
caused a slight inconvenience to 
some, but which we hope will be. 
remedied in the future.
The decorative scheme consisted 
of hundreds of vari-colorcd bal-. 
loons and pennants, hung so dense
ly from overhead wires that the 
ceiling of the gymnasium was vault-, 
ed and concealed from view. At 
a given signal the balloons were 
dropped upon the revelers and then 
the fun began.
Music was furnished by the ver
satile Venetian Scrcnaders a pop
ular unit well known on the, cam
pus to both the night and day stu
dents for their lively rythm and 
style.
Throughout the evening refresh
ments were served "by an efficient 
personnel, and the usual quaint 
dance programs remain a souvenir 
of the affair.
Chaperons for the 'occasion were 
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Dosey, and 
the social committee was pleased 
to have them as guests.

NIGHT ARTS TO HOLD 
DANCE IN THISTLE HALL
Novel Features to Be In
troduced During Eve
ning For First Time
Thistle Hall is to.bethe scene 
of the Night College of Fine Arts 
dance being held this Saturday 
evening. This is the first affair to 
be given by a night school group 
in the new hall, Avhich is claimcd 
to be one of the finest and most 
attractive halls in the city. Its 
cheerful setting will lend a gaj' 
colorful atmosphere to the affair 
that will long be remembered. 
Night Arts dances have always 
been unusual affairs but this one, 
in new surroundings, will no doubt 
be gayer than any of the past. 
Entrance to Thistle Hall is gained 
from Woodlawn Avenue, just be
low Skibo Inn, where a convenient 
marker points to the door.
To further add' to the spirit of 
the occasion a novel form of tag 
dancing has been devised by the 
committee and will be introduced 
for the first time during the eve
ning. The committee feels sure 
that everybody present will co
operate with them and. make this 
feature a success that will add 
greatly to the evenings enjoyment.
Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Hilton, Mr. 
and Mrs. R. T. Hyde, Mr. and 
Mrs. Everett Warner, Mr. and Mrs. 
Norwood McGilvary, Mr. and Mrs. 
J. C. Moorhead and Mr. and Mrs. 
Raymond .Simboli have been asked 
to act as chaperons for the dance. ,
Tickets are now being distribut
ed by H. E. Mauro, A. N. Evans, 
H. E. Schwartz, J. P. Stevens and 
J. H. Sansonetti. Be sure to see 
one of these men for your ticket if 
you want to assure yourself of a 
good time on Saturday evening. 
This dance is free to regularly 
registered Night Arts students only 
and admission will be by ticket 
or your night Arts Registration 
card. E. S.
Second Semester 
Begins This Week
Just at this time the night stu
dents arc entering upon the second 
semester of work for the college 
year of 1931-32. One hardly real
izes Jhat the first half of the year 
is over and that grades arc now 
being turned in to the. Registrars 
office. Except for the examina
tions which have been given in 
most, of the courses during the 
past week, the night students 
would not be aware of the close 
of the semester.
There is no pause in the sched
ule of the' night sessions as classes 
resume immediately after the final 
examinations arc given on Friday. 
So we have the classes all resum
ing on Monday for another semes
ter. There will be new students 
registering this week for some 
courses which are given only in 
the second semester and also other 
students returning to the campus 
after a semesters absence. Per
haps some of the night students 
know of some former students who 
are not aware that registration is 
going on for the second semester 
and a suggestion is made by the 
Plaid that this fact be brought to 
the attention of these former stu
dents; There may also be some 
acquaintances who need just a 
word or two from you to set them 
straight on the courses which arc 
being offered at the Institute. Give 
this information, or have these peo
ple come out to the campus and 
make inquiry at the Registrars 
Office for the necessary date.
Post Holiday Dance

BYERS PAINTINGS 
ON EXHIBIT NOW
Forty-five Canvases Hung in 
Carnegie Art Galleries
An exhibition of primary impor
tance, the Alexander M. Byers col
lection of paintings, is being held 
in galleries E, F and G in the
Carnegie Institute. The fifty-five 
canvases will be on display until 
March 15. These paintings, all by1 
famous artists, are in great con
trast to the work of modern artists 
recently shown at the thirtieth
International.
The collection presents an un
usual history of art from about the 
end of the sixteenth century to the 
beginning pf the twentieth. Peter 
Paul Rubens St. Andrew is the 
oldest painting. It is a strong,
finely drawn head of the apostle. 
Franz Hals, of Antwerp, has many 
notable works in the collection. 
Undoubtedly the best portrait of 
the group is the superb "Portrait 
d un Abbe, by Sir Anthony Van 
Dyck. George Romney, the grdatcst of the eighteenth century por
trait painters, is represented by 
Two Young Girls.
Canvases by Gainsborough, Tur
ner and Sir Joshua Reynolds (Por
trait of David Garrick), together 
with those of Romney, make an 
anthology of English art that is 
probably the best that Pittsburgh 
has yet seen. In addition, Charles 
Francois Daubigny and Jean Bap
tiste CamilleCorot have furnished 
some landscapes. Having seen the 
first of Corots three painting's, you 
have seen them all, for they arc 
all based on misty forests, with 
tiny figures dancing in the fore
ground.
Jean Baptiste Edouard Dctaillc 
andf Louis Ernest Mcissonier arc 
represented by two small paintings, 
Garden Scene and Studio re
spectively. No exhibition in the 
nineties without a henna-haired 
Henner was considered complete.
By consulting the Night Student 
Carnegie Handbook we find that 
the next social function to be spon
sored by the Night Student Coun
cil is the Washingtons Birthday 
Dance. The dance is scheduled to 
take place in the Gymnasium au
ditorium as this is the oniy place 
large enough on the campus to 
accommodate the large attendance 
which the functions of the Night 
Student Council cnjojr.
The committee is working on an 
elaborate program for the affair 
and announcements from time to 
time will be made. Tickets will 
be out shortly and those workers 
on the functions of the Night Stu
dent Council will be made their 
quota. So, we advise all those 
who arc looking for a splendid 
evening to reserve February 22 for 
the coming event.
No, Im not the same, regard
less of what the professors say. 
After five nights of loafing through 
some of the toughest examinations 
in the whole history of the institu
tion I have emerged conquered by 
the inevitable. I tell you, boys, 
when they set out to get you, 
there is no stopping. You would 
think the end of the world was in 
sight. One look at some of the 
examinations and you would be 
convinced that all the textbooks 
in creation were insultedrather, 
consultedso as to conquer the 
indomitable spirit and will of those 
night students who are seeking an 
education. Down with the w'hole 
system of being idle. I thought I 
could get away with it, but you 
know only the privileged few who 
sit on the other side of the fence 
can succeed at the pastime.
Yes, the Post-Holiday dance was 
a succecs, but the nightwell, I 
dont need to mention it to you. 
You are all aware of what kind 
of a one it was. Didnt seem to 
dampen the ardor of those who 
attended the frolic on the twentythird last, however. Never enjoyed 
such a dance in my life before. 
Everything was there, even to the 
sandpaper on the floor. You would 
think that the dancers were used 
as sanding machines so that the 
floor would be in condition for 
the most important of all func
tionsbasketball. And all the lum
ber, which was strewn around, why 
it resembled a lumber yard or two. 
Ill have to admit that the com
mittee in charge of this dance did 
a whale of a good job in disguising 
all the side shows, even to trying 
to making the floor suitable for 
dancing. Bravo, night committee; 
you have my sympathy for the 
way you surmounted all the ob
stacles in making the gymnasium 
suitable for the dance. Well done, 
and I hope you succeed always.
* * * * *
Well, I guess the next order of 
things will be Nuts to Soup. Might 
as well have this as try to put the 
dog on at a boxing bout. 
Wouldnt that can a bushel of to
matoes, and some. Im like the 
poor correspondent in the last is
sue of, the Tartanthe moths have 
nested in my swell suit and I 
hate like forty to disturb them. 
Id much rather feel at home in 
my every-days than in one o f 
those all dolled up and no vplace 
to go suits. When you find me 
at a boxing show in one of those 
things youll,'see something and I 
dont mean maybe.
I'm all worked up over that long
distance runner for knowledge at 
night and cant wait until this is
sue of the Tartan, to see who, 
where, what and how, the winner 
is. You can just bet that he comes 
from Alaska, Becks Run, Polish 
Corner, Cabbage Hill, or some 
such place for knowledge. We 
night students do things big when 
start out to accomplish some1*11 throw out my 
chiestyou see, I am on the side 
lincis looking on, because an Idle 
Niguit Student doesn't amount to 
muciji even in a marathon race for 
knowledge. At all events, I'll be 
waitirlg for the results of this con
test ajnd I'll vote for the winner 
every I time.

First Semester Exams Hold Up 
Work of the Committee
Last week the committee had 
expected to be able to publish final 
data on the marathon traveling 
champion of Carnegie Tech, but 
the niad scramble of the examina
tions wrecked the program of the 
committee, so that it was impossi
ble to get the material compiled in 
time for this issue of the Plaid. 
It is too bad that the examinations 
had to interfere with this impor
tant work, but such was the case.
As a final promise, the commit
tee will be inshape shortly to give 
the information with outstanding 
facts concerning this unique con
test and you will surely be surprised 
at the results. S.

which is in his usual snowrhorsc

The Peace Conference Interests Students
The widely heralded International Disarmament Con
ference opens in Geneva today amid a world breathing war 
and distrust, making the most sanguine expect but little 
from this assembly of diplomats.
The college student, normally considered incapable of 
an appreciation t>f world affairs, and ordinarily concerned 
with the meandcrings of a complex social, existence, has 
become conscious of the* disarmament question. Organi
zations, zealous in their appeal for pacifism, have founcj 
the collegiate world a fertile field for the spirited oratory 
on national defense. Student delegations have met all over 
the country, national polls have been taken, representatives 
have visited the' President^ and even now a student is in 
Geneva to interpret the conference for the colleges.
Now that the eagerness of the students to enroll as 
conscientious objectors to war, and to become a voice in 
the destiny of their nation has achieved such proportions, it 
would be well to look at the paradoxical situation pre
sented today with virtual war existing in one continent, 
internal disorders and revolution on another, and a world 
wide peace conference invoked on a third.
With China and Japan engaged again in an old conflict, 
German restless under the binding terms of the Versailles 
treaty, and Franco heavily armed yet manifesting anxiety 
for its security, the world is unusually restless. England,  
experiencing internal difficulties, is spending as much as 
France on armaments, while the United States has a larger 
budget than either nation (although a rating of only sixth 
on a basis of population.)
The attitude of the various nations going into the dis
armament conference gives the indication that it is merely 
a show to keep the public interested in a harmless discus
sion that has been doomed to failure long ago. in the out
spoken papers of Russia the conference is declared a low 
political shuffle aimed at bamboozling the peoples of the 
world. 
France, taking to the conference its policy, "Arbitra
tion, Security of else Disarmament, is the chief stumbling 
block to reduction of military organizations. Setting up 
the League of Nations as an instrument for arbitration and 
then proving that means of world peace ineffective, France, 
declares by its second policy, Security, before accepting 
disarmament. The French people, constantly reminded of 
the fact that France has been invaded five times in the last 
150 years, believe reduction of their armies will again lay 
themselves open to aggressive enemies.
Germany, reduced to the point where it is defenseless 
even from Poland,, is calling loudly for parity with the 
countries of Europe. The probability of Germany obtain
ing the consideration in the Versailles pact requiring dis
armament of the other European countries' is slight.
Great Britain, having taken some steps to prune its 
own military budget, is willing to co-operate should any 
development involving all nations arise. The role of volun
tary reductions is no longer popular with her.
Italy is joining the conference -with apparent enthu
siasm for reductions as a means of aiding recovery from 
the strained economic conditions. She is the most optimis
tic of the larger nations in lioping for disarmament.
The United States is entering the conference in some
what the big brother role. It' has expressed the inten
tion to do anything that will not interfere with its own 
policy of remaining aloof in such matters as security pacts 
Such pacts arc at. present the only apparent means of ob
taining reductions.
The most hoped for a.t the opening of the conference 
is perhaps some treaty or pact whereby the nations will 
agree to cease armaments for a year or more. This would 
afford the taxpayers some relief and give the nations a 
chance to recoup financially. Even here the words treaty 
and pact arc but promises. China was supposed to be 
safe from invasion on the basis of such written promises.
The well meaning pacifists who declare for a policy of 
non-resistance even in the case of invasion, may learn some
thing from Chinas situation.. China, thoroughly unpre
pared, and apparently pacifist toward the world has 400,- 
000,000 people threatened by small Japan. Also consider 
the boycottwill iot work when the non-combatant nations 
weigh their moral scruples with the opportunity for in
creased wealth?, * * * *
College, commonly accused of undermining religious 
faith, is strengthening the religious conceptions of the stu
dents, according to the results of a recent questionnaire at 
Wellesley College, at Wellesley,'Mass. The results were of 
special interest because Wellesley requires a critical stud}* 
of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible of all sopho
mores and juniors.
FROM THE FENCE.
Snatches
The Elm Iiall-Dclt combination were observed walking from "somewhere in Schcnely with the Delt missing. Numerous offers of free taxi service were received from kind gentlemen but were spurned. . . . Not to be outdone by the boys who sojourned in the jug and acquired numbers for names the Elm Hall girls use numbers among themselves instead of mere conventional names . . . this same Delt uses the abovementioned girls dorm for a study hall. Nice atmosphere, eh? . . . The Forbes girls complain that they havent had their share of p u b 1 i city but what can they expect? They dont do anything or when they do it must be hushed. One little item tlio is that a Pitt chap insistedthat Jean Shirks warning list was too short so promptly increased it. What a big help! . . . Mr. Kohl retracts .a former statement and scz, "Maybe there is a wee chance for the right girl.". . . Will Halloway hasnt done anything in partic-' ular recently so wc wont mention his name this time. . . . Say, did that Sprenkle boy put a big letter man in his place one day? . . .* * * *
More of Somewhat the Same
The Tech boys just cant keep out of the papers. A Miner tripped and jarred a downtown theater usher and presto, plenty of publicity. ... A near campus apartment housed many and various card players, easy a dozen, one sunny P. M. In running for the marathon record one group lasted 8 hours. . . . The Skibo Spring surely is making a mess these days with the overflow running all over the walk. Something ought to be done about it. . . . Heard Nutter say to his companion one day, "You should have gotten me a dance with her. Id have talked you up. Boy, oh, boy! . . . The boys in the Heat, and Vent. Dept, arc still wondering where that girl is, that Bill Sclinozzlc Gisling was raving about before they went on their trip to Cleveland. She was supposed to have three cars
O. K., Dukes!
Students arriving late for the game on Saturday evening discovered that their students books were not recognized. It is very disappointing to have .to attend a school, that can be linked with such names as the Carnegie Foundation, and be forced to feel the sting of commercialized athletes. It is hoped that the future will find a solution for
the seating problem of the students, who may arrive fifteen minutes before the start of the game.  * * *
A Top Notch Prom
Say, what could be nicer than casing around thru a many-colored haze to the slow rythmic tune of Hush. O'Hares music? Three guesses. No, you can't think of one nicer thing. And everyone will be there. . . . Incidentally wc get a bargain matinee next Wcdcnsday with a threehour tea dance schedule.* * * *
Saturday Nite
Well be honest about the dance this time. Nobody was there of any importance, except a few with a feeling -of their own. The girls were nervous as usual and consistently showed signs of the creation of a bored sense of good humor. When the girls at the dance didnt know what to do with their hands they asked for a cigarette.And how amateurish they do smoke. They lighta cigarette, take two puffs or so and knock off ashes the rest of the time because 'they sense their own nervousness and self-consciousness. . . .Where did Jim Baushkc ever get that ridiculous coat lie wears when he leads the band? Call Sclicnley^ 5000 and ask for Bettyshe knows. . . . Mr. Orbin has done everything now but lead the orchestra and bring_ a date. He was checkingcoats on Saturday night. . . .^* * * *
Heres How!
Mike Kinley is the last of the Bachelor Club to succumb. Apparently the suggested plan of incorporating as a married mens club next semester will go into effect. . . . The Aero students have elected the president of Yale an honorary member. Incidentally this new member recently endorsed beer as proper for his students. . . . It wont be long now until we all enter exam week (hell week to you). Heres the best of luck to everybody. . . .* * * *
Some Help!
One night dark and dreary about a fortnite ago some very "obliging chap opened a window in the Hut that the Librarians have been futilely struggling with, for ages. The only trouble was that the chap charged for the job by rifling the cash ' drawer. On a second trip he wasnt so oblig, ing because lie just took the cash without doing any odd jobs in return. ....

MUD AND TREACLE, AT THE Y PLAYHOUSE
ic PgtpJ 1pScdS
Among the successors to Shaw, 
Galsworthy and Barrie, the young 
playwrights who are, most prominent 
and promising in England today arc 
Noel Coward, John Van Drutcn and 
Bonn W. Levy. At least one play by 
each of them has been presented in 
Pittsburgh and at the moment two 
comedies by Mr. Levy, Springtime 
for Henry and "The Devil Passes, 
arc running successfully in New 
York. On next Sunday and Monday 
evenings he will be represented by a 
third play, Mud and Treacle, which 
the Co-operative Playhouse under the 
direction of Milton Brauman will of
fer in the auditorium of the Y. M. 
and W. H, A. on Bcllcfield avenue. 
This piece, though seen in London, 
has not yet been produced in New 
York.
In Mrs. Moonlight, Mr, Levy 
was paying his respects to J. M. Bar
rie, but in Mud and Treacle, he is 
crossing Bernard Shaws social phil
osophy with Noel Cowards reflection 
of post-war. manners in which mordant 
wit clothes the disillusionment of the 
younger generation. It is a generation

dents is well-likened to having one person talk into a recording device and make a wax record. When the record is played the machine repeats the identical sounds previously" made. Yet the machine is no different for having played the record.
that boasts of having found new 
values but is apparently not very 
happy in the discovery. The heroine, 
in fact, feels nervously unstable and 
for all her modernity is unready to 
allow that romance is treacle. 
Rather, she illustrates Mr. Shaws 
theory that woman far from being 
courted by man is very subtle 
wooer and .on her own terms. Nay, 
she often waits motionless. That is 
how the spider waits for the fly." 
The heroine is a modern Beatfice, 
however, and wins her unwilling 
Benedick to a surrender that the 
final curtain leaves in a tableau of 
anything but romantic glow, for the 
hero in his theories is a very 
Shavian person. Through him and his 
colleague come forth the authors 
smart observations not onl}r on love 
and marriage but on the whole or
ganization of the state.
As will be surmised, "Mud and 
Treacle is a comedy of ideas,'most 
of them being presumably "advanced 
and a few of them in less than good 
taste. As with the characters of Noel 
Coward, these of Bcnn Levy are in
teresting not because they arc warm
ly attractiveindeed, they are not, 
but because they speak wittily and 
startle us by the unexpected. They 
serve a satirical purpose, satire be
ing Mr. Levy's right merry medium.

of the department to tax students 
energies with disastrous results. 
The hardest problems are included 
only to give students of special 
aptitude a chance to prove such 
talent. Mr. Rosenbach says that 
difficult problems enable instruc
tors to separate the sheep and 
goats among their students. On 
hearing this, we decided every one 
of us must have special aptitude, 
we think that all the problems are 
difficult.
Dr. Ross admits that the Eco
nomics department tests its stu
dents not only on their acquisition 
of material, but also on their abil
ity to think.
Mr. Fisher of the English de
partment thinks that the ideal Eng
lish exam would be one question, 
Write down just what you got.out 
of the course. However, because 
of the perfect avalanche of blankblue books lie would probably re
ceive, he must content himself with 
questions such as these, Who is 
Shakespeare? Who is Coleridge?" 
Most students have heard of 
Shakespeare, and a few of them of 
Coleridge.

FINAL EXAMS
With the rapid approach of first 
semester finals, the energy of the, 
entire student body acclerates in 
an attempt to successfully prepare 
for the forthcoming examinations. 
For the senior, who realizes that 
one more short semester will wit
ness his graduation into the world, 
and for the freshman, inexperienced 
and bewildered, who quivers in 
anticipation of the unknown hor
rors of a final, this examination 
period will prove to be a memor
able one. But, regardless of a 
students class, the problem of how 
to arrive at or near the top is 
uppermost in his mind.
Between success and failure the 
difference is surprisingly slight. 
The traversing of that distance lies 
in the hands of the individual, but 
the space must be covered gradu
ally and pcrsevcringly. The prin
cipal of a large New York high 
school says: "Labor gets results, 
but these are not always immedi
ately perceptible. Advancement is 
to all appearances a series of leaps 
and not a steady, continuous, slow 
grind upward . . . Many level 
stretches must be traversed before 
the coveted next step is reached 
and many disheartening slips back
ward must be experienced.
In each of us lies the ability to 
turn achievement into failure, or 
vice versa. With us lies the de
cision. Temporary success can hin
der or help. Success with a capi
tal S may be slow in making its 
appearance, but it is among the 
most desirable, worthwhile things 
on earth.
In prc-contcmplation, then, of a 
week of more or less conclusive 
examinations, there can be only 
this to consider: it lies with us.
