Dr. Chworowsky Made 
Co-ordinator of C. I. T. 
War Committees
On September 23, President Do
herty made official appointsments to 
the C. I. T. War Committee. Dr. 
Martin Chworowsky was appointed 
Co-ordinator for Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. Under Dr. Chwo
rowsky is a Committee of thirty, 
whose duties are to study and make 
recommendations to the administra
tion regarding matters relating to 
defense activities on the campus, 
and to carry out any specific assign
ments that may from time to time 
be delegated to it. The first meet
ing of the War Committee will be 
held on Thursday, October 15, at 
4:30 in the Arts Building.
The blood bank drive, under the 
chairmanship of Professor Vincent 
Parisi, has already gotten under 
way. Mrs. Norman H. Dawes, gen
eral chairwoman of the faculty di
vision; Mr. Edward Hawkes, chair
man of the maintenance division; 
and Mr. Charles E. Wangeman, 
chairman of the administration di
vision, have already sent out pledge 
cards to their respective groups. 
When the cards are returned, the 
Red Cross will be contacted to send 
a mobile blood collection unit to the 
Tech campus.
The First Aid course organized 
by the Committee this year is the 
major, regular function. The Com
mittee intends to make the campus 
First Aid conscious, which is in 
keeping with the National Civilian 
Preparedness Program. Registra
tion is still open.
Other activities of the Committee 
will be the organization of volun
teer nurses program, fire auxiliary 
units, medical services, and training 
of air raid wardens.
The theme of this years Commit
tee will be similar to last years, in 
that its aims are: 1) Protection of 
persons from aerial attacks; 2) The 
development of civilian morals; and 
3) Cooperation with the Armed 
Forces on the matters of civilian 
defense.

Rhines will be the chairman of a 
meeting concerning copper-base al
loys and Dr. Fetters will preside 
over a meeting on the physical 
chemistry of steel making.
Air Raid Drills
All personnel on campus should 
do the following:
1. Make sure of the location of 
shelter zones in the various 
buildings, and especially of the 
zones assigned to rooms utiliz
ed.
2. Find the best method of access 
to the proper zone from each 
room used.
3. In case of an air raid drill go 
to the proper zone quietly and 
quickly and obey any instruc
tions given by the wardens.
Instructions as to air raid drill 
warnings and location of shelter 
zones will be found posted in each 
room or each group of rooms where 
one sign is sufficient.

United War Fund Drive 
Opens October 19th
The United War Fund Campaign 
will open its drive at Tech October 
19, the day after the United War 
Fund Pageant at Forbes Field. De
fense organizations on campus will 
have representatives soliciting in 
the class rooms of the three colleges 
for one week.
Formerly the campaign was 
known as the Community Fund, but 
this year it is no longer merely a 
civic duty; it is a patriotic duty to 
give. In addition to the original 
Community Fund organizations, the 
various war relief societies also 
comprise the membership, USO con
tributing the largest share. '
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1942
Shep Fields Plays 
For Military Ball
Carnegie Techs annual Military 
Ball will be held in the gym on Sat
urday, October 17, from 9 to 1.
During the evening the new 
pledges to Scabbard and Blade will 
be formally announced. The posi
tions of the honorary cadet officers 
will also be made known.
Every year the Advanced R. O. 
T. C. elects from among the sen
iors several girls to hold the rank of 
honorary cadet officers. The num
ber of girls chosen equals the num
ber of new pledges being called to 
Scabbard and Blade. This year 
year there will be fifteen. There 
will be one cadet-colonel (most 
votes), one lieutenant-colonel, five 
majors and eight captains.
The fifteen honorary cadet offic
ers are Barbara Bums, Frances 
Carlock, Christine Clinton, Maureen 
Dyer, Madeline Forsythe, Marian
na Hogg, Jean Layton, Jean Phipps, 
Suzanne OBrien, Lucille Orr, Mar
tha Sekey, Mary Ellen Smith, Mary 
Sullivan, Marjorie Weatherwax and 
Louise Zonge.
Shep Fields and his new brassless 
orchestra will provide the music for 
the Ball. In eliminating the brass 
sctiorfnd plamg~p the woodwinds, Shep has created a new kind 
of music that is certain to satisfy 
both the sweet and the hot dancers. 
During the evening the orchestra 
will make a nation-wide broadcast.
The decorations planned for the 
dance are timely. They include mil
itary flags of the United Nations, 
and various pieces of camouflaged 
military equipment made in the 
camauflage classes. It is interesting 
to note that the favors which will be 
given at the door contain no vital 
war materials.
Although Scabbard and Blade, na
tional R. O. T. C. honorary, spon
sors the Military Ball, it is im
portant that the students realize 
that it is a R. O. T. C. event. All 
students, Basic and Advanced 
Corps, are earnestly requested to 
attend in uniform.
Tickets are on sale in Adminis
tration Hall every day from 11:30 
to 1:30. The cost is $3.30, including 
tax.
Army Enlistment Office 
Will Be Discontinued
The Tech Army Enlisted Reserve 
Corps office has been discontinued, 
and its duties taken over by the 
Military Department. Since the be
ginning of this semester, this office 
has enlisted 291 men in the army re
serves, 162 being in the pre-induc
tion class, 101 in the advanced R. O. 
T. C. Engineer Corps, and the re
maining 27 being in the Signal 
Corps of the R. O. T. C.
In the future, all applicants for 
the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps 
must apply to Lieutenant T. J. Collum in the Military Department. 
His present instructions assure a 
continuance of enlistments until the 
end of the present calendar year.

literally, for one of Als more clan
destine past-times is eating his own 
cookies. We know, however, that 
he has seen more of a bunsen burn
er and a test tube these past four 
years than he has of frying pan 
and an oven, for he is completing 
his fourth year in the Department 
of Chemical Engineering.
A1 is a member of the Citcom 
Clan, and has often been called the 
best non-fraternity fraternity man 
on the campus for he has been seen 
eating lunch at the Pi K. A.s din
ner at the Kappa Sigs, and drinking 
beer with the Betas. Nevertheless, 
he is an ardent Citcom enthusist, 
and besides holding the position of 
Vice-President of the Clan, has no 
use for commuters who say they 
have no time for extra-curricular 
activities. He believes it is better 
to get a 2.75 and participate in 
school activities than to get a 3.75 
and be inactive.
Als popularity on campus is 
shown by some of the offices he 
holds. He was elected President of 
the Engineering Senate, is the 
Chairman of the Freshman Orienta
tion Committee, and Vice-President 
of Student Council.

Hold That Pose, TTBT Discloses 
Sensational Mystery of Week
By Helena Aronson
Now it can be told! Hold your 
hats, take a firm grip on your false 
teeth, and we shall disclose the mys
tery of the week. TTBT stands for 
 are you ready?  Theta Tau 
Bridge Tournament. See, its all so 
simple. Thats why they claim no 
rubber shortage. And it does pay 
ten to one. The first prize is ten 
dollars in cash or in war stamps, 
and the second prize is five dollars.
Any two students may enter  
two girls, two boys, one boy and one 
girl, two dramats, or two engineers. 
The names of the partners, their tel
ephone numbers, and a paltry one 
dollar must be given to Mrs. King 
in the Registrars Office not later 
than twelve oclock noon, Satur
day, October 17. After the pairings 
are made you will be given two or 
three days to play the first match 
at your convenience. This does not 
however mean that you must play
continually for three days. Nay, 
nay, bridge brains. To save wear 
and tear on the cards and your hair, 
the preliminary game is limited to 
three rubbers or two hours, which
ever is the minimum. Copies of the 
score sheets signed by the four 
players should be handed in to 
Theta Tau at the post office before 
the deadline. Deadlines, results of 
games, and pairings will be posted 
on the Beanery door and on some 
conspicuous place in Margaret Mor
rison. The matches should be play
ed off as soon as possible.
Those who lose in the first round 
are requested not to do anything 
drastic; for they have another 
chance in the consolation tourna
ment. Prizes will also be awarded 
to the winners in this contest.
Auction is definitely out. Con
tract is the only kind of bridge that 
will be sanctioned by ye honorable 
Theta Taus.

Tartans Aerial Attack Fails; 
Superior Case Team Wins, 24-6
Although Tech lost to Case 24 to 6 
on Saturday, they gave a good ac
count of themselves, drawing first 
blood early in the game. Landon of 
Case fumbled a punt when hit hard 
by Ramsay; Purcell, playing one of 
the best games of his career, jump
ed on the ball at the Case eight yard 
marker. Byers plunged to the one, 
and then McLaughlin flipped a neat 
pass to Captain Joe Pash.
Case had a similar break, minutes 
later, when McLaughlin on an off 
tackle smash, fumbled on Techs 17. 
Hankes scooped the pigskin up for 
the opponents; two plays later 
Mlakar skirted right end to score 
without being touched. Near the 
end of the first quarter Case moved 
deep into Tech territory when 
Eisher, on a reverse, raced over 
tackle for 15 yards and then lateraled to Mlakar who picked up ten 
more before getting smeared by 
Purcell and Burns.
Late in the second quarter Tech 
was placed in scoring position when 
Chuck Jones, Tech, center, inter
cepted a pass, and lateraled to Pash 
who sprinted through the Case sec
ondary for 37 yards. However, 
after two first downs, Case tightenJunior Varsity Football

A Case of Demoralization
By Don French
For those who are mildly interested in what is going on in the Tech 
sports world, a pep rally was held last Friday evening. Or perhaps this 
is an overstatementthe only thing that happened is that a few people 
went to a great deal of trouble, only to have it flop miserably for lack of 
support of a student body which wants so much to have a winning team. 
To a casual observer the general impression received would be a ludicrous 
demonstration of a few people trying to act like college men and women 
who havent ambition enough to let themselves go to the effort of really 
giving a decent cheer.
But we dont wish to attack those who attended. Rather let us di
rect our attention to the droves of people who stayed away. A fine exam
ple was set by one member of our Student Council, who, at the meeting 
last week, pushed hard for the pep rally. Neither he nor twenty-one 
other members of Council were there. Are the leaders of student gov
ernment too imbued with their own dignity to give not only their ideas, 
but their active support?
At the half, we not only want Al, but we NEED him. We needed him 
on Friday night. Two cheer leaders were present. They led a few poor
ly timed, half-hearted cheers, and that was all that was heard of them. 
The one thing that is notable about the cheers this year is their bad timing 
and their consequent lack of support. No one wants to cheer at a pep 
rally when the platform is empty. Nor do they want to cheer while a 
play is being run on the field. And paradoxically it is the crowd that 
leads the cheers and not the leaders. It is difficult to show any spirit 
when those who should be leading are lagging.
The next rally will be held before the Pitt game. If the student lead
ers, and the students are not there, rallies might just as well be abandoned as a waste of effort, time, and money.____________________________

Revised Eligibility Rules to Govern 
Evening Student Council Aspirants
This Saturday evening at eightthirty oclock the Evening Students 
will gather in the Exhibition Room 
of the College of Fine Arts to hold a 
 combined Election Party, from 
whence will come the college and 
council officers for this year.
Every student who is eligible to 
hold office should come to the elec
tion party and strive to gain an of
fice. Last years ranks have deplet
ed to the extent that only four of 
last years council members are 
bade in school and these four are 
from the College of Engineering. 
Shortage of candidates will be 
acute.in the Industries and Fine 
Arts.
Council eligibility rules have 
been changed drastically to ease the 
situation.
Here are the following major 
rules:
1. A student must be enrolled 
in the Evening School at Carnegie 
Tech and must have paid the activ
ities fee.
2. A student must have been en
rolled on the campus for at least one 
year.
3. A student must carry an aver
age of at least three attendance 
hours per week, except in the De
partment of Music in the College of 
Fine Arts where at least twentyfour units per year will be requir
ed.
4. The student must have earn
ed passing grades, D or better, in 
all subjects in both semester and 
in the supplementary term if en
rolled, or the last year enrolled in 
the evening school.
5. A student must have earned 
an insignia for activities awarded 
by the Evening Student Council.
6. There is no longer a limit to 
the total number of major offices 
held in past years on the campus.
Evening students will be permit
ted to bring their dates to the party. 
There will be dancing (music by 
way of the juke box) with refresh
ments served on the side. With 
lots of single fellows expected to 
be present the girls of Fine Arts, 
Industries and Maggie Murph 
should not be backward in attend
ing. This in itself is an opportunity.
It is important that the student 
bring along his registration card as 
it will be needed to gain admittance 
as well as to obtain a ballot during 
the election.
Lure of Education 
Conquers Distance
The following geographical sur
vey, presented by the Registrars 
Office for publication is proof that 
distance is no object in the path of 
education, for many students travel 
many miles in order to attend eve
ning and part-time classes at Car
negie Tech. The survey has been 
set up to indicate how many stu
dents attend from each town and 
county. Allegheny County totals 
are listed below. Space does not 
permit the printing of all counties

Rubber Conservation 
Demands Pooling of Cars
The Share A Ride slogan which 
is being so successfully carried out 
all over the country offers a fine op
portunity to spread the feeling of 
good fellowship among the new
comers to the campus.
No doubt the scarcity of tires and 
the approaching enforcement of the 
new gas rationing law is presenting 
a serious transportation problem to 
many night-school students. It may 
be that many of our students live in 
the same section of the city and in 
order to conserve tires and gasoline 
it would seem that it should be 
possible for these students to ride 
together in one car.
If arrangements like this can be 
worked out it will not only afford 
the opportunity of becoming better 
acquainted with those who study 
with you but will also lengthen the 
life of your car. Why not talk it 
over with your classmates?
Remember to: Drive only when 
necessary and under 35 miles per 
hour.
Dance is Postponed
As announced in last weeks is
sue of the Plaid, the Annual Nu 
Sigma Alpha Dance which was to

Thistle Hall has been postponed. 
Any further arrangements in this 
connection will be announced at a 
later date.

Between the halves of the Tech-Geneva game, 
several members of the Kiltie Band were called to 
the Sully Clan, the band honorary. Mrs. Robert 
Doherty is shown awarding the honorary keys, 
assisted by Mrs. Webster N. Jones.

By far the most popular attraction at Carnival 
Night was the Beta booth which did a landslide 
business. Above, Frank Graham is about to heave

their crack at a Beta.\

The Obstacle Course
It was two weeks ago that some passer
by might have heard sounds of excited 
voices echoing through the morning air 
from the depths of the Carnegie Bowl. 
Then there came the sound of feet on 
wood, and suddenly the gym-clad Car
negie Commandos burst into full view 
as they came over the top and continued 
around the much-vaunted rat-race.
Starting with a ladder climb (1), the 
course leads ovea fence (2) and down 
twelve feet of rickety, shaking poles (3). 
On the Soccer field, the victim is forced 
to jump a hurdle, leap or climb an eight 
foot wall (4), go on through a jungle 
climb, swinging between widely-spaced 
bars (5), and over, under, and through 
a series of fences (6). Following this is 
an easy one (for some)--to walk a bal
ance board (7)- The course continues 
through a tunnel (8), over a high-hurdle 
and under a bar.
