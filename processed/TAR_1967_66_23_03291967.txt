NDEA Grants Sponsor 
Tech Summer Programs
Carnegie Tech has received $160,000 from the U.S. Office of Education to conduct 
four of Pennsylvanias 15 NDEA Institutes of Advanced Study to be held this summer. 
Approximately 160 secondary school teache rs in economics, English, and history are ex
pected to take advantage of the Tech programs.
The only economics summer
institute in the program will be 
offered at Carnegie Tech by Dr. 
Philip Saunders, assistant pro
fessor of economics and indus
trial administration, and his 
staff.
The economics program in
cludes courses in Economic An
alysis and Policy and Introduc
tion to New Economics Mater
ials and Teaching Strategies. 
Dr. Saunders hopes to use these 
courses, as well as informal pro
grams, to review and improve 
the participants understanding 
of a few carefully selected areas 
of economics, and to improve 
their teaching of economics at 
various grade levels.
English Programs 
The department of English is 
one of five in the state to spon
sor a six-week program for highschool English teachers. Dr. 
Robert C. Slack, director of the 
summer institute, explains that 
a master teacher involved in 
curriculum planning coupled 
with a promising but less ex
perienced teacher will represent 
each school.
The formal curriculum in
cludes courses in Literary Cri
ticism and The Structure of 
Modem Language and a sem
inar in Curriculum Planning. 
Dr. Slack hopes that the insti
tute will encourage the teams 
of participating teachers to 
engage in innovative curricu
lum planning upon returning 
to their respective schools. 
Carnegie Techs department 
of history deserves special com
mendation for receiving two out 
of three of the NDEA grants 
awarded to Pennsylvania col
leges for Institutes in history. 
Under a grant of $37,310, 50 
full-time social studies special
ists, representing each state in 
the union, will participate in a 
three-week institute.
Guest Instructors 
Ten nationally known direc
tors of social studies curriculum 
Projects will discuss innovative 
aPproaches to history and the 
social sciences during the twoweek session from June 12 to 
24, 1967. A second course will 
focus on the problems of dis
seminating methods and mater
ials. Course work for the third 
week of the institute to be held 
in Feb., 1968, will be based on 
topics discussed in June.
According to co-directors Ed
win Fenton and Richard B. 
Ford, the institute has two 
goals: to develop techniques 
for assessing curriculum pro
jects and to devise methods 
for disseminating the results 
of curriculum reform."
The second NDEA grant of 
nearly $40,000 will support a 
year long institute for 60 studies 
teachers in the Scholars se
quence of the Pittsburgh Pub
lic Schools. The program will 
give teachers an opportunity to 
study the principles on which 
the principles on which the 
the five-year Scholars Program 
has been based.
During the institutes one for
mal course entitled The Struc
ture of History, teachers will 
explore the work of social stud
ies curriculum centers across 
the country as well as examine 
the application of the structure 
of history to political science, 
economics, sociology, antropology, geography, and psycho
logy.
History Objectives
Co-directors Edwin Fenton 
and Mitchell P. Lichtenberg 
have set four objectives: to 
compare the structure of his
tory to that of other social sci
ences; to explore new methods 
and materials in teaching these 
disciplines; to encourage learn
ing in a cumulative process; 
and to evaluate the effect of a 
year long part-time program on 
teaching.
Tech is one of 72 colleges and 
universities to receive NDEA 
grants for the summer of 1967 
and the academic year 1967-68. 
The U.S. Office of Education has 
awarded 493 grants worth near
ly $30 million.

Student Government and four 
for the Vice-Presidency. Also, 
Dale Peschel, a junior in me
chanical engineering, is running 
for President as a write-in can

Lenny Wanetik, an officiallyrecognized Presidential candi
date, has withdrawn from the 
race in favor of Peschel. The
two men had not previously 
been associated in any way, nei
ther through personal friend
ship nor through working to
gether. Wanetik, when asked 
why he had bowed out, said, 
Its a long story. I think Pes

Composer Conducts Work 
At Kiltie Town Hall Concert
The Carnegie Tech Kiltie Symphony Band will begin its 
Spring Concert Tour this evening at 8:15 pm with a concert 
at McKeesport Senior High School. The tour includes con
certs at North Hills High School (tomorrow) and at Hershey, Pa. (Friday), closing with a concert in Town Hall,
York City, on Sunday. --------------------------------------------
Concert similar to the one plan
ned for Sunday. New York 
Times critic Robert Sherman 
said of the 1966 Town Hall con
cert solid music-making . . . 
(the band) performed with good 
intonation and with remarkable 
flexibility . . . (with) rich son
orities and an impressive range 
of dynamic shadings.
In, addition to selections by 
Bach, Ingolf Dahl, and Percy 
Grainger, the 115-piece band 
will perform the Symphonic 
Movement by Vaclav Nelhybel 
under the direction of the 
composer at the Town Hall 
Concert. Edward Maddens 
Carnegie Fantasia, a concert 
medley based on Tech songs 
and Scotch folk songs, will 
conclude each concert.
Vaclav Nelhybel first heard 
the Kiltie Band in 1965, when 
the band was featured at the 
main concert of the 1965 Music 
Educators National Convention 
held in Buffalo, New York. Nel
hybel commented that the Kil
tie Bands playing was com par 
able to the best bands of Eur
ope including the famous Garde 
Republicaine Band. At its Win
ter Concert in Carnegie Hall, 
Oakland, the Kiltie Band per
formed Trittico, another of Nelhybels recent compositions for 
band.
The Kiltie Band is directed 
by Dr. Richard E. Strange, 
associate professor of music. 
Before coming to Tech, Dr. 
Strange was director of bands 
at West Virginia University. 
He had been high school band 
director at Clifton, Kansas, for 
ceven years before accepting 
a teaching fellowship at Bos
ton University where he ob
tained his doctorate in perfor
mance.
Last December the band per
formed for some 500 music edu
cators at the Pennsylvania Mu 
sic Educators Association Con 
ference in Harrisburg. A year

EDITORIALS... 
Is There A Need?
Is there a definite need for a student government on this campus? Although 
the answer is perhaps confused by the past inactivity of student government, this 
body is a necessity.
Ore measure of its functionality n certainly i .3 accomplishments. This, in 
fact, is one reason for the pessimistic attitude many have towards this group, 
since relatively little has been done in the past three or four years by student 
government. However, as two presidential candidates point out, much of the work 
is done by committees, such as student activities budgets, big weekends, or re
modeling Skibo. Hence, it is not completely fair to judge student government on 
its general accomplishments unless one includes the many details handled through 
committees.
Most important, however, is the fact that it is an organized student group 
that can speak for students in student-administration or student-faculty rela
tions. It has the ability, on paper at least, to be a pressure group, lobbying 
in order to attain specific student goals or demands.
Another, less tangible function of student government is that it is a buffer 
between the administration and student activities. Most Tech organizations enjoy 
a large measure of autonomy from administrative influence. If, however, student 
organizations had to deal directly with the administration for budgets, as some 
advocate, or if committee were organized directly through the administration, 
this buffer would not exist and more administration control could be exerted.
In selecting the future president and vice-president of student govern
ment, it is imperative that all these points be considered. One cannot have 
an effective government through campaign promises of a ehieken-in-everypot, nor can one expect action from a government led by people who fail to 
attract talented people, and organize them for maximum performance.
The best possible president or vice-president is one who can accomplish 
this, who organizes the government so that it is a viable force. He must be able 
to deal with students and administration equally well.
The proper question is not whether there is a need for student government, 
but instead is, can student government fulfill this need adequately? The ultimate 
answer depends upon those chosen as leaders by the student body.
Effective Leadership Required
The coming student government elections already have one distinguished 
feature; the fact that more candidates than ever before are vying for both the 
presidential and vice-presidential offices. This in itself prompts at least one ques
tion. Are those running for office truly interested in the office as an opportunity 
to improve the lot of the student at Tech and his relationship with the faculty 
and the administration, or is it just an opportunity to add another office or activity 
to a list, like a campus honorary?
One method of attempting to answer this question is to critically ap
praise the platforms of these candidates. All the presidential candidates rec
ognize the present, inactive state of student government, and all note that 
student senate must be more effective. But cognizance of these facts does not 
imply that the reasons behind the inactivity or lack of effectiveness of student 
government are recognized. What is to prevent anyone of these candidates 
from falling into the same traps as his predecessors, namely failure to make 
it an effective, viable force on campus. ,
 %
Two candidates, Rick Stafford and Ron Haan, recognize explicitly the func
tion that committees serve in student government, yet only Stafford notes that 
it is important that they be led by responsible chairmen and organized early so 
that they do their job most effectively. Stafford does direct his attention to over
coming some of the existing problems in student government. He notes that the 
senate needs more student participation, though he does not mention how one 
might develop this participation. He also recognizes the importance of acceptance 
of the senate by the administration. Finally, Stafford points out that communicaI 
tion, both inside the government as between committee needs, and outside, as 
between the senate and the students, is important. The major drawback to Staffords ideas seems to be the lack of definite methods of accomplishing these goals.
Ron Haan, on the other hand, has very little to say concerning the im
provements of existing conditions. He does recognize the fact that student 
government has been inactive, but prescribes no methods for curing these 
ills. Instead, his approach is to try to dazzle the prospective voter with a bit 
of fancy footwork, praising, on one hand, some of the so-called accomplishments 
of a few committees, and the other, citing as many controversial issues as he 
can, promising to solve all of them without appreciating or even understanding y 
the complexities of each situation.
The closing statement of Haans platform is indeed reminiscent of the reign 
of the predecessor to the current vice-president of student government, who tried 
to do everything himself. Of course, student senate did absolutely nothing that 
year except pass, after much political bickering, the new student government 
constitution.
If Haans platform appears to be pie-in-the-sky, certainly the joint plat
form of Albertson and Falon excells in dazzling the voter with many optimistic, 
if not unrealistic promises. The crucial question to ask is how do they expect 
to carry out all these campaign promises? The platform uses such vague and 
nebulous phrases as maintaining a positive attitude towards all campus acf? 
tivities (whatever that means) or maximize cooperation. (How?)
To make absurd campaign promises, as Haan and Albertson have done, 
seemingly without any knowledge of the factors involved in the present circum
stances surrounding the problem, is to display a naivete that is not commensurate 
with being an effective, dynamic leader.
Of all the presidential platforms, only one appears to grasp the prob
lems involved in making student government an effective body, that of write 
in candidate Dale Peschel. His platform concerns itself primarily with building 
a viable government. He recognizes the problem of communications both inside 
and outside government. Most important is the fact that Peschel is cognizant a, 
of the fact that many ideas and opinions originate outside the government, and 
that it is the governments job to top these ideas, and act on them. Equally 
important is the improvement of communication from student government to 
the students, thus keeping the general student population informed as to what 
the government proposes to do. Student opinion on issues is another important 
matter that he mentions, and he follows this with the idea of acting upon 
these needs once they have been determined.
Peschel is also guilty of failing to outline adequately how he would accom
plish some of these goals, such as seeking a representative student opinion. On 
the other hand, the points he raises about revitalizing student government are valid, 
and show concern for avoiding the mistakes of previous student government leaders. I 
One must remember in choosing the next president of student government, 
that ability to lead and organize the government into an effective, powerful body 
is more important than simply generating ideas that will have no meaning if the 
government is ineffective through lack of leadership.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Wanetik Withdraws 
From Prexy Race
At this time it is both my pri
vilege and honor to withdraw 
from the race for President of 
Student Government in favor of 
Dale Peschel. I feel that Dale 
is a better man than any of us 
for the job as it will exist next
year. Thus, I urge all those who 
supported my candidacy to cam

Peschel Enters 
Presidential Race
Since I submitted my petition 
too late to be considered as a 
candidate on the ballot for pres
ident of Student Government, I 
would like to present myself 
as a write-in candidate. The 
Rules Committee did accept my 
candidacy on this basis, so here 
is my platform:
Fortunately, Student Govern
ment at CIT is not plagued by 
political parties. For the most 
part, the student body agrees on 
fundamental problem areas of 
the campus. Ideally, the senate 
is the organization where stu
dents can make evaluations and 
proposals with respect to these 
needs.
I think it is a fair judgment 
that senate should never floun
der for lack of ideas because 
there are a significant number 
of people on the campus who 
are interested in student life. 
An effective Student Govern
ment must tap their ideas. This 
is essentially a problem of com
munications as well as a prob
lem of maintaining interest. Fur
thermore, senate is hindered by 
the inherent fact that each year 
there is a considerable turnover 
in membership, and a lack of 
tradition. When all is said and 
done, the single potential bind
ing force in government is its
leaders. It is basically the presi
dent and vice-president who 
must instill interest and enthusi
asm in the members of the sen
ate and the student body, as well 
as add dignity to the organiza
tion. To this I have to offer my 
leadership ability, and a pool of 
fresh ideas that I do not think 
can be matched.
There is a major problem of 
student awareness existing on 
campus today. As the govern
ing body of this campus it is 
composed of a small minority of 
participating students, so only 
a small number of students 
first, know what is taking place, 
and second, have a hand in gov
erning current affairs. This 
should not be. Instead, there 
must be greater student envolvement. This does not mean 
increasing the size of Student 
Government  that would just 
decrease effectiveness. With the 
right leadership, Student Gov
ernment can be made to rep
resent all the students, and act 
according to their needs and 
wants.
The communication break
down does not stop on the student-Student Government level. 
There is a potent gap between 
the students and administration. 
There is a solution to this prob
lem, too. Presently, there exists 
an Academic Affairs Commit
tee which has the potential of 
~viding the missing link. This 
committee, composed of stu
dents and faculty, will have to 
seek out the ever-reticent stu
dent opinion, bring it to wide
spread attention, and then pre
sent proposals to the adminis
tration and Student Government.
With the coming change to the 
university level, the administra
tion will have to act on such po
licies as student provisions  
the Yale system of providing 
completely for students needs, 
or the European system of let
ting the student provide for him
self. Decisions like this require 
knowledge of the students opin
ions and feelings. Without seek
ing and finding out these feel
ings, any decision of this mag
nitude might fail the students.
Another area requiring con
siderable attention is the judi
ciary system. Presently, there is 
considerable need for co-ordinatiort between the judicial bodies 
having jurisdiction over Morewood, the fraternities, the 
dorms, and the campus as a 
whole. AWS has taken steps, 
and MDC is now taking steps 
to revise their judicial system. 
The effectiveness of these re
visions should be scrutinized, 
and compared with the overall 
system. Then ,an effective bal
ance might be established in 
making legal decisions in the 
campus courts.
These are but a few impor
tant points. There is much to 
be worked out and completed 
before Student Government will 
be the effective body that it 
needs to be. However, steps have 
been taken, and progress made 
and unless emphatic leader
ship is carried on, all will be 
for naught.

Rick Stafford
(President)
It is important for any group 
of people united by common in
terests and needs to have an or
ganization which makes provi
sions for the fulfillment of these 
interests and needs. On Carne
gies campus, the student body 
has an administration to cater 
to its needs. However, the ad
ministration's concerns are not 
always in common with those 
of the student. Thus an organi
zation run by students can best 
determine what students desire
in the way of housing, academic, 
athletic, food, and receration po
licies.
This is why we have Student 
Government. But we must make 
it effective if we hope to soon 
realize our desires.
Much of the work in Student 
Government is done in commit
tees. These committees need re
sponsible chairmen and active 
members to function properly. 
Such talent must be sought out. 
As president of Student Govern
ment, I would like to get the 
organization of each committee
begun early and its goals set. 
For instance, the Union Com
mittee must determine exactly 
what the student and faculty con
cept of a better student union is 
as soon as possible and then 
work closely with the adminis
tration to assure the achieve
ment of concrete plans.
Communications among commitees should be improved by 
meetings of committee heads. 
More joint meetings of student 
and faculty committees with 
common goals should be encour
aged. Records in the form of a
final report of the years activ
ities submitted by committee 
chairmen should be kept to make 
the job a little easier for fol
lowing years. Some committees 
provided for by Student Gov
ernment but presently inactive 
should be reactivated. Two such 
committees are the Tech Com
mittee dealing with collegiate 
athletics and the Activities Com
mittee dealing with co-ordinat
ing and stimulating interest in 
campus activities. Constantly 
changing conditions on campus 
also create needs for new com
mittees, such a committee to 
correspond with other campuses 
for the purpose of exchanging 
ideas and promoting intercol
legiate events on our own cam
pus.
Student Senate, which acts as 
the official student sanction of 
committee work, should also act 
as a sounding board for student 
opinions and ideas. Not only 
does Student Senate need more 
people willing to take a senate 
position, it needs more people 
taking enough interest to attend 
(Continued on Page 12)
Ron Haan
(President)
Tech needs a much stronger, 
more active Student Senate 
which has more control over all 
student activities. Where does 
our Student Government stand 
after one year under a new con
stitution? Exactly at the same 
point it was last March before 
the new constitution was adopt
ed. The Student Senate is little 
known for its accomplishments. 
Student respect for the govern
ment is as low as ever, and 
rightfully so, for what has been 
done by the Senate in this entire 
year to help the students?
Things arent all bad though, 
for several Student Senate com
mittees have been doing a fine 
job. The Student Union Commit
tee has probably been the most 
active. Their work in develop
ing a very cordial, very pleas
ant eating area on the mezzanine 
of the Tartan Grill is an un
matched accomplishment at 
Tech. Another committee which 
has not been wrapped in leth
argy is the Food Service Com
mittee. It is at least partially 
responsible for the tremendous
ly improved conditions in food 
service at Morewood and Skibo. 
Also the one committee in the
Senate which consistently seems 
to do a great deal of work is the 
Finance Committee and this 
year was no exception. The com
mittee seems to have combined 
the budgets of the various or
ganizations very carefully 
But I say this isnt enough. 
The Senate should be a sound
ing board for complaints from 
all students. It should be a body 
well known to students for what 
it does and can do. Its the job 
of the president, working very 
closely with the vice-president, 
to see that these things are 
done. He must be very active in 
student activities so that he is
in a position to hear complaints, 
spot areas that need improve
ment, and then to see some 
changes made. The active stu
dent is able to look all around 
him and see what has to be 
done.
Having worked as chairman 
of the Library Committee, the 
Parking Committee, the General 
Campus Committee, the Fresh
man Advisory Committee, and 
the Food Service Committee, I 
have been in a position to see 
several problems which have an
noyed students.
One problem which recurs an
nually is the conflict between
Tech students and the Pitts
burgh Police overy buggy prac
tices. This is an issue which the 
students have a strong opinion 
on and yet we are not support
ed the way we should be by the 
administration. A strong Stu
dent Senate would be in a posi
tion to solicit that support.
Another problem found very 
annoying to many students is 
the inability to study for exams 
because they have classes, pa
pers, and tests right up to exam 
day. Many students feel that we 
should have at least two days 
without classes, tests, or papers,

1) Maintain a positive atti
tude toward all campus activ

sizing constructive criticism. Co
operation shall be maximized 
and interference shall be re
stricted to such instances as 
misappropriation of funds and 
deviation from the constitution 
(both student governments and 
that of the organization in ques
tion).
2) Provide one or two largescale concerts for 1967-68: for 
example, anyone from the 
Temptations to Henry Mancini could be contracted for a 
reasonable inexpensive Friday 
or Saturday evening. concert at 
Carnegie Music Hall.
3) Investigate the possibility of 
obtaining first rate movies (i.e. 
Dr. Zhivago, etc.) to be shown 
on campus at cost to the student 
body.
4) Provide one or two cam
pus-wide dances with a big-name 
band (Rock and Soul).
5) Create activity and move
ment in Student Senate by re
ducing formality and red tape, 
and assuring that presentations 
given during meetings are kept 
brief and explicit.
6) Initiate and continue pres

the following:
a) Completion of Skibo 
(Snack Bar, Highlander Room, 
etc,)review past plans which 
have not met with approval and 
come up with one acceptable to 
all.
b) Review of the housing sit
uation. Specifically, we would 
support and assist Mens Dorm 
Council in its eforts towards im
proving the dorms.
c) Remodeling of the Book 
Store.
7) Procure candy/cigarette 
machines for Baker Hall; obtain 
a free juke box for Skibo, etc.
8) Set up solid lines of com
munication with neighboring 
campuses in regards to social 
activities. This would include 
proper and efficient advertise
ment of local college mixers, 
movies, plays, concerts, parties, 
etc.

vice, similar to Pitts. This
(Continued on Page 7)
Tom Moore
(Vice-President)
My stand is simple. I want to 
make Student Senate into an 
effective organization. I believe 
Student Senate is lacking in
that:
A. A very small portion of 
the student body is interested 
in what is going on.
B. As a result, Student Sen
ate does not necessarily repreTom Moore
sent the interests of the whole 
student body, but rather those 
of an active minority (through 
no fault of this minority which 
does try to represent everyone).
C. And because of this, ac
tions of Student Senate do not 
carry the weight which actions 
representing the whole student 
body should.
I propose to remedy these by:
A. Institution an informant
committee or network of peo
ple whose purpose will be to 
keep the entire student body 
(both those living on campus 
and commuters) informed on 
what is happenening and to con
cretely sound out (20 guys in 
my hall like plan A, 10 like plan
B, and one guy had this idea 
. . .) student opinion on pro
posals this does not conflict 
with the duties of the represen
tatives, but rather will provide 
them with an index (in fact 
might be responsible directly to 
representatives) and by solving 
this problem would enable rep
resentatives to spend more time 
making Senate work.
B. This in turn should create 
more student interest and will 
give Senate actions more power 
since now they will represent 
(Continued on Page 8)
Mike Smolens
(Vice-President)
Student Government must 
solve two major problems if it 
is to utilize the authority given 
it by the constitution. Primari
ly, it must develop strong and 
responsible legislative, executive, 
and judicial bodies which have 
the support, co-operation, ana 
most importantly, the respect of 
the student body. At the same 
time, it must gain the confidence 
and co-operation of the admin
istration. In order for the govern
ment to exercise its full author
ity, therefore, it must have the 
co-operation of the administra
tion in meeting the numerous 
obligations it has to the stu
dents.
Because the Senate is respon
sible for every organization on 
campus, it must do more than 
merely offer recognition to these 
groups. I would like to see Gov
ernment keep itself continually 
informed of the size, activities, 
finances, and the effectiveness of 
each organization, so that when 
one of them is having problems, 
for example WRCT, it can offer 
its immediate assistance.
Another area in which I would 
like to see major improvements 
is communications between Stu
dent Government, the students, 
and the administration. The cam
pus community should know 
what its student government is 
doing and in which directions it 
is heading. When the students, 
not to mention the representa
tives themselves are not inform
ed of impending action in ad
vance so that both sides may 
be present to present their cases, 
Government cannot hope to 
claim to be representative of the 
student body. In addition, the 
campus must be informed as 
soon as possible of action taken 
at meetings. This could be easi
ly done with articles in the Tar
tan, as well as be included in 
newscasts on WRCT. Student 
Senate should be an organiza
tion to which the student body 
can express and achieve its 
needs and desires. The means of 
this expression are through 
elected representatives from each 
segment of the campus popu
lation. This, however, is not 
enough. In order to meet the 
demands of an ever changing 
university environment, the sen
ate floor must be a sounding 
board for all student problems, 
not jugt those conceived by a 
handful of elected officials.

Bob Schulman
(Vice-President)
Bob Schulman
Student Government as an or
ganization is basically the sum 
of several committees which deal 
with the problems of the cam
pus. In Student Government, as 
in most organizations of thi9 
nature, a majority of the work 
is done in these committees. Re
ports are made by the commit
tees to the Senate at each meet
ing.
Why then do the students at 
Tech not know what is being 
done? The answer lies not in 
Student Government itself, but 
in the lack of communication
between S.G. and the student 
body.
My proposal to eliminate this 
problem is as follows: Each 
week the heads of all S. G. com
mittees would be required to 
hand in short summaries of 
work done that week. These re
ports would be collected and 
condensed and would appear in 
a two or three paragraph sum
mary in the Tartan.
Communication problems are 
also evident between the student 
body and the faculty. Proposed: 
The Academic Affairs Committee
of S. G. would incorporate in its 
membership two or three stu
dents from each department in 
the school. These students would 
meet regularly with their re
spective department heads to 
discuss problems which the stu
dents felt important
These students would then re
port to the Academic Affairs 
Committee where these prob
lems would be discussed and 
proposals for their solutions be 
made. In this way, students 
might be able to gain more free
dom in the choice of courses
and to suggest improvements in 
course curricula.
While on the subject of stu
dent faculty relations I might 
discuss one other idea. A teacher-evaluation pamphlet, written 
by the students for the students, 
could be produced by some subsidary of Student Government 
and might prove to be an in
valuable aid.
There are many pressing prob
lems with which the student 
body is already yquite familiar.

March 30, at 4 pm.
He is Dr. David Krech, pro
fessor of psychology at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley.
Dr. Krechs topic will be 
Brain Research, Intelligence 
and Society.
Rated by follow psychologists 
as outstanding in work leading 
toward a better understanding 
of what happens in the brain 
when the organism learns, Dr. 
Krech has focused attention on 
the neurological influences on 
intelligence and learning, and 
the effects of science on human 
behavior.
He is a leader in his field, 
said Dr. Garlie A. Forehand, pro
fessor and associate head of psy
chology at Tech and chairman of 
the Bingham committee.
Dr. Krech has held visiting 
professorships at Harvard, Uni

has authored many works on 
the social and physiological as
pects of psychology and is a 
member of the American Psy
chological Association, past pres
ident of the Society for the Psy
chological Study of Social Is
sues, and a Fellow of the Amer
ican College of Neuropsychop
harmacology.
The Bingham lectures were 
established in honor of Dr. Wal
ter VanDyke Bingham, who di
rected the Division of Applied 
Psychology when it was found
ed at Tech in 1915. The division 
was the first of its kind in the 
U.S. He was considered a pioneer 
in the application of psychology 
to industrial problems and con
ducted intensive research into 
the psychology of the talented 
child. Many of his studies were 
concerned with the psychology 
of music. He died in 1952.
Sponsored since 1954 by the

FDIC Commissions GSIA 
For Banking Research
An investment of $99,690 has been made in a Carnegie 
Tech electronic research project that is expected to return 
big dividends to the nations banking industry.
The funds were awarded by
the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. (FDIC) to develop the 
FDIC Bank Management Sim
ulation, a computer model of 
the commercial banking world, 
and to promote research into 
banking problems.
Conducting the project at Car
negie Techs Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA) 
are Dr. Kalman J. Cohen, pro
fessor of economics and indus
trial administration, and J. Tim
othy Heames, GSIAsi director of 
admissions and a PhJD. candi
date.
Their simulation approach is 
designed to expose participants 
in the program to the analytical 
techniques of bank management 
and bank examination, and to 
test possible new banking pro
cedures and techniques at min
imal cost.
Plans to create the FDIC 
Bank Management Simulation, 
Mr. Heames said, stemmed from 
his and Dr. Cohens interest in 
banking and in games as edu
cational devices. Mr. Heames is 
considered Techs expert on 
GSIAs successful management 
gamea complex decision-mak
ing contest in which graduate 
students compete with each oth
er using computers to manage 
assorted industries.
Dr. Cohen is recognized as one 
of the worlds experts on the 
application of management sci
ence techniques to banking prob
lems. He has recently co-author
ed a book, entitled Analytical 
Methods in Banking, which is 
considered to be the foremost 
work in this field today.
Although the thrust of the 
project will occur on the Pitts
burgh campus, Carnegie Tech 
and FDIC will farm out sections 
of the research to other schools 
with special competence in spe
cific areas. The University of 
Wisconsin, for example will 
formulate an econometric model 
of the economy, while Purdue 
University will develop a simAbertson-Fallon

wherever possible.

gree will call for the application 
of pure research in the process

by the committees of Student

maintain a high exchange be

should bring their lunches trays 
to 106 Skibo, starting today, 
March 29. Women are reminded 
that they can sign up to get

Other official candidates are 
Bob Albertson, Ron Haan, and

After graduation, what?
Will you begin your career as an 
engineer or scientist or return to 
school for an advanced degree?
You can do both at NOL
If you are an engineer in the top third of your class or a scientist in the top quarter 
of your class, NOL offers you the opportunity to begin your career in one of the world's 
great laboratories and, at the same time, go ahead with your plans for graduate study.
NOL is a laboratory in the true meaning of the word, and
one of the large?: and best-equipped laboratories in the 
world. It is the nations leading R&D establishment for 
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), the Navys principal high 
speed aeroballistics activity, and a leader in the develop
ment of new air and surface weapons. The spectrum of 
research at NOL ranges from nuclear effects to acoustics 
to explosives and materials. At NOL, weapons development 
is carried through from inception to design to prototype 
test and development. Since 1950, NOL has completed 209 
new weapons and devices such as SUBROC, nuclear depth 
bombs, mines, projectile fuzes, underwater detection sys
tems, and components and design data for POLARIS, 
TARTAR, TALOS, TERRIER, ATLAS and TITAN missiles. A 
civilian staff of over 3,000 people includes more than 1,000 
professional engineers and scientistsexperts with na
tional and international reputations. Extensive and unique 
facilities embrace wind tunnels operating to Mach 17, 
hypervelocity ballistic ranges, the world's most exceptional 
hydroballistic facility, shock tunnels, 300g centrifuge... 
multi-million-dollar experimental facilities.
Here is your opportunity. Each year, NOL interviews out
standing engineering and science graduating students. 
Selects the handful that seems to be reafly creative. Takes 
them to its beautiful 875-acre "campus" (the front yard 
is a golf course) in the rolling hills of Maryland near the 
Nations Capital. Puts them through an optional one-year 
professional development course with rotational assign
ments to various areas within the Laboratory to prepare 
them for permanent assignments.
From the very beginning, new staff members have an oppor
tunity to contribute directly to significant projects... to 
be part of an organization where groups are small ana 
emphasis is on the individual.
NOL offers you a graduate study program that is one of 
the largest and most productive programs in the country. 
Each year members of our professional staff receive M.S.s 
or Ph.D.s through this program. NOL has a significant ad
vantage in its proximity to the University of Maryland. Many 
NOL staff members hold permanent part-time positions on 
the Maryland faculty, and graduate level courses are taught 
at NOL every semester. Maryland also offers many courses 
on its own campusonly minutes awayat times which 
are convenient to and keyed to the special requirements 
of NOL

Also I have heard numerous 
complaints about the lack of ex
changeability between courses 
in differeht colleges (i.e. a Mar
garet Morrison girl taking Fine 
Arts courses). This problem 
should be thoroughly investi
gated by the Academic Affairs 
Committee of the Student Sen
ate.
There are lots of small prob
lems which merit examination 
such as the following: (1) The 
library should open earlier on 
Sundays, (2) The possibility of 
keeping the first floor of the li
brary open all night, (3) Open 
the gym to students on Sundays,
(4) Regrading the IM field so 
that it will drain, eliminating 
the swamp that exists for sever
al days after every hard rain,
(5) Eliminating the problem of 
girls and guys on Food Contract 
who miss meals because of 
classes or rehearsals by permit
ting them to use their contract

(6) Exploring the possibility of 
having a Speed Reading course

greater communications prob
lem existsthat between Stu
dent Government and the stu
dent. On a purely informative 
level, this will be accomplished 
by revitalizing the Publicity 
Committee of Student Senate. 
Its main function will be to pro
vide the Carnegie Tech Tartan 
with accurate accounts of every
thing that is being done in Stu
dent Government. On another 
level this can be accomplished 
by making Student Government 
a functional organization as out
lined above, one that is invol
ved with student problems and 
does something about them. If 
Student Government were such 
an organization, it would stim
ulate student interest. Interest is 
the best method of effecting 
communications and it is a con
dition necessary for responsible 
participation.
Thus, as president of Student 
Government, working closely 
with the student body and ad
ministration, I propose to make 
Student Government an organ
ized body in which we can take 
an enjoyable part and obtain 
prompt, direct resolution of our 
problems.
One thing you canassume at Fairchild  responsibility
The quicker the better. And the time 
has never been better for fast individual 
growth. The demand for our products 
has never been higher (111 new prod
ucts and product families introduced by 
our divisions last year). And company 
sponsored R&.D amounts to over 11 mil
lion dollars yearly.
We make it as easy as possible for the 
creative individual to assume responsi
bility and move up. (Freedom to follow 
ideas through. Minimum of red tape. Lots 
of technical support and cross-fertiliza
tion of ideas.) And we have many young 
executives to prove it.
Each one of the 12 operating divisions 
functions autonomously, enabling each 
one to concentrate on its own product 
development and research. Weve found 
it reduces conflict usually found in large 
centralized corporations in which many 
products and men compete for man
agement attention and action. 
Openings in most locations for all 
degrees:in market research, design and 
industrial engineering, sales manage
ment, marketing, chemistry, field sales, 
production engineering, accounting, sys
tems engineering, finance, manufactur
ing engineering, and R&.D.

Committees should play an 
ever-increasing role in Senate 
legislative activity. As vice-pres. 
ident of Student Government, I 
would try to make much better 
use of Senate time, utilizing the  
committees to perform most of 
the ground work on issues, and 
only when a proposal is finalized 
should it be discussed at length 
on the Senate floor itself 
Through the work of the Food 
Service Committee,I would like 
to see co-educational dining at 
Skibo, in addition to the aboli
tion of the mandatory food con
tract at Morewood. The Union 
Committee should concentrate 
first on making Skibo a student, 
not a community, union; and 
only then on the physical ren
ovations which are so necessary 
to bring Skibo up to the stan
dards of student unions at com
parable universities. A commit
tee on student housing should 
be established to assist men and 
womens dorm councils in the 
pursuit of better living condi
tions. The Tech Committee 
should, with the creation of Car
negie University, push very 
strongly for enlarged athletic 
programs and facilities. Several 
innovations, one of which is a 
freshmen leadership conference 
held in the fall to interest new 
students in participating in cam{ 
pus activities, would help organ
izations which are struggling 
for capable student involvement 
With pressure from the Senate, 
a bigger and more efficient 
bookstore might finally become 
a reality.
Once Student Government has 
shown that it can meet its re
sponsibilities to the campus and 
has gained the co-operation and 
respect of the administration 
and the students, it can quit its 
lackadaisical, defensive posture 
and take the offensive in mak
ing proposals to the administra
tion, and making sure that each 
proposal is carried out. I look j 
forward to having the oppor
tunity to help build Student 
Government into a strong, effi
ciently run organization, one de
serving the respect of the stu
dent body.

ities for the present dorms, im
provements in Skibo, and ex
panded operations of the book 
store are among these. The vice
present of Student Government 
wiH be in position to accomplish 
these aims.
In all of his duties a vicepresident must be familiar with 
what has been done or discussed 
previously and with what is 
feasible for him, in his position 
vice-president, to accomplish. In 
addition, he must be well ac
quainted with the committee 
structure of S. G. and with the 4 
workings of each committee. 
Without this knowledge a vicepresident will lose a good por
tion of the school year in orient
ing himself to his post and in 
finding out what has already 
been done.
It is for this reason that I beI 
lieve that a good vice-president 
can only be selected from active 
members of this years Student 
Government.
