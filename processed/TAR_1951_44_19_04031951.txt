Printing Department Raid 
Nabs Big Counterfeiting Ring; 
Bugsy Sterling Is Arraigned
T Men late last night broke up a national counterfeiting ring when they arrested four 
students and several printing faculty members in a raid on the presswork laboratory of the 
school.
Agent S. Spade and two printers were wounded in a short gunbattle, which resulted
^in the arrest of two instructors 
known only as General Mills, alias 
Georgie, and Bugsy Sterling, who 
claims that he is head of the de
partment and just happened to 
walk in before the raid.

ARCHITECT'S CONCEPTION OF RAZING* * ?
Razing Industries Hall 
For Football Stadium
Foreseeing a great football future for Carnegie after its victorious 
1950 season, the alumni will have completed a drive to construct a 
100,000 seat football stadium, to be ready for the fall season.
The site of the new, all-plastic stadium will be the southwest
? corner of the campus, the present 
site of Industries Hall. April 9 isF ullabull Prize 
Goes To Tartan 
For Jingolism
The Fullabull Prize, symbol of 
achievement in the field of jingo
istic and disjointed journalism, 
was awarded recently to the Car
negie Tartan for its outstanding 
efforts during the past year.
In a citation with the prize, the 
Tartan was congratulated for its 
accurate announcements of future 
meetings and its equally good 
coverage of those past. The judges 
found these announcements in
tensely interesting and well-con
structed.
Other points which impressed 
the judges were the Tartans lib
eral use of its Patronize Tartan 
Advertisers theme (especially 
since there are so many ads), the 
judicious misspellings which serve 
to keep the readers interest alive 
and, in the same vein, the occa
sional omission of a continued 
line from the bottom of a story 
which causes the readers to look 
through the entire issue to finish 
an article.
The Tartan becomes the first 
independent publication to win 
the prize in recent years since, in 
the past decade, the award has 
gone predominently to govern
ment agencies for their aston
ishing ability to use more and 
more words to say less and less in 
the least understandable manner.
the scheduled date of the razing 
of IH.
In order to meet the possible 
shortage of classrooms, the Col
lege of Engineering and Science 
plans to hold classes in Panther 
Hollow, Phipps Conservatory, and 
the Greeks.
Since the attendance at the CIT 
games was much smaller than that 
at other local colleges having less 
enviable records, the active Car
negie Tech alumni society of Ka
bul, Afghanistan, started the cam
paign which succeeded in raising 
$4 million.
Designed by the freshmen class 
in architecture, the stadium will 
offer many outstanding features 
such as an artificial rain machine 
to keep the field in perfect condi
tion, found only last season in 
the W&J game.
Other devices are air pumps to 
lower the fatigue of the pipers, 
mechanical cheer leaders, and 
electric trams to haul the play
ers to and from the bath rooms, 
replacing the out-dated shower 
rooms.
Committed Releases 
Colossal Program
30 Name Bands Scheduled To Play; 
Administration Cancels All Exams
Throwing caution to the winds, the Spring Carnival Committee 
has laid plans for the most ambitious Carnival in all history,. This 
years affair will be held from April 15 to May 29 and will feature
30 name bands, plus guest appearances from 
tionally known stage and screen ? 
personalities.
It is obvious that the dates for 
Carnival will preclude any pos
sibility of final exams. Although 
there was great student opposi
tion on this point, the administra
tion succeeded in railroading the 
plan through Council.
Set Off Bomb
The exploding of a new-type 
cosmic bomb, especially con
structed for the occasion by the 
Physics Department, will signal 
the beginning of the celebration.
During the first two weeks the 
theme of Carnival will be A Ro

After months of planning, Delta

is to install trolley service across

students.
This move was a result of Delta 
Skulls attempt to justify its ex

Such a plan would, Delta Skull 
president, S. O. Botch said, re

By Dolly Mitchell
STILLS . . . Women's Dorm Coun
cil is investigating the report that 
certain Morewoodites are brewing 
trouble in their bathtubs in the 
form of moonshine. The investi
gation began as a result of a re
port that strange odors were com
ing from Tower D.
DIAL TROUBLE . . . Speaking of 
investigations. An article which 
appeared in the Washington Tri
bune stated that the Senate Crime 
Committee planned to come to 
Carnegie Tech. The Committee 
wants Carnegie Tech publications 
to explain why their telephones 
run such large bills each month; 
they are trying to break the bookie 
racket.
SPORT SHORT . . . WAA is 
planning to expand its activities 
next year. The board met with 
Coach Baker last week to plan a 
program of football for women. 
They may play the G string on the 
varsity squad next fall.
ABOUT THE HOLES . . . After a 
thorough investigation a reporter 
discovered why the holes were 
dug over the campus. The senior 
mechanical engineers were testing 
some new equipment received by 
the department. In their enthu
siasm over the machine the en
gineers dug a little more than was 
necessary for testing purposes. 
LOST . . . While preparing stew 
last Tuesday the Skibo cook cut 
his finger. If any Tech student 
found the fingertip will he please 
return it to Skibo immediately. 
PROPOSITION . . . Student Coun
cil has proposed that Wednesday 
classes be eliminated. They be
lieve this proposal would bring 
more emotional stability to stu
dents because the school would 
consist of a 4^4/7 ratioa much 
pleasanter figure than the old
5 Mt/7 ratio.
BANNED . . . The Administration 
will issue a warning to the Tar
tan shortly. The cartoons, they 
feel, are not of the high caliber 
that a college newspaper should 
exhibit.
CONGRATULATIONS . . . The
Sigma Nu fraternity has just re
cruited its hundredth pledge. This 
sets an all-time record for this 
college's fraternities.
BARGAIN DAY . . . The Book
store is featuring a special intro
ductory give - away offer. A 
shrunken human head, choice of 
male or female, will be given 
away free with each copy of the 
Spectro-graphic Analysis of Compoundsidr ochlorichy drobakelite. 
WOW! . . . Delta Tau Delta is 
forming a campus chapter of 
WCTU. Those interested may ap
ply at the Delt house any Satur
day night.
Poisoning Laid 
To Home Ec; 
53 Affected
Investigating Group 
Clear Women's Dorm; 
Carrot Strips Blamed
A cloud of mystery pervades 
the Home Economics department 
as experts seek the reason for the 
sudden epidemic of food poison
ing in Morewood Gardens. Since 
meals at the womens dorms have 
been dismissed as a plausible 
source of the epidemic, the finger 
of accusation points to the Home 
Ec department as the offender.
Curiously enough 53 students 
took to their beds after 53 stu
dents were served luncheon last 
Thursday at-the Tea Room in the 
MMCC building. The administra
tion cautiously admits that this 
fact might be in some way related 
to the 53 cases of food poisoning 
recently reported.
It has not yet been ascertained 
whether the poisoning (if a result 
of this luncheon) was due to the 
apple pan dowdy or the crinkled 
carrot strips. Doctors say that the 
snail soup with snail shell crou
tons could not possibly have been 
the cause.
Foods and Nutrition majors 
who prepared this weekly lunch
eon deny putting wood alcohol in
to the spiced tea. It might be not
ed. however, that two F&N jun
iors are still minus one bottle of 
shoe polish, one of Halo shampoo, 
and a bottle of nail polish re
mover.

The gang was caught on a tipoff by a disgruntled student mem
ber who gave his alias as Paul V. 
Offermann. He squealed because, 
They thought I was stupid with 
only a 4.3 factor.
None of the gang, which was 
caught with wet money lying on 
the floor, would talk at first. But

had heard tha* the real boss of the 
gang was Stogie Cleeton.
After Grade 
At the special session of the 
Crime committee, a student said 
that he participated in the gangs 
operations only to get a better 
grade from Georgie.
Gieorgie first refused to talk on 
the grounds that he would incrim
inate himself, but when the TV 
camera focused on his twitching 
hands, he finally broke down. He 
said, I did it only to make some 
money.
All members of the gang ex

without bail. Offermann was re

Draft Six-Year-Olds 
Says Jake Warner
In a special statement made to the Tartan today, Carnegie Tech 
president, Jak Warner announced that he was flying to Washington 
immediately to fight for a new draft law. Warner said that he in
tends to propose the drafting of all males upon reaching their sixth
birthday for a period of ten years.*----------------------------------------
This is the only way in which 
colleges can hope to survive the
present emergency, the president 
commented.
The Tartan heard from a very 
reliable source that Warner has 
been irked on to his latest move 
by the drafting of two of his righthand men, Elliot D. Smith and 
Webster N. Jones. For awhile it 
was hoped that both Smith and 
Jones would fail the rigid Army 
mental test, but such was not to 
be their fate.
Must Attend CIT
Besides recommending the 
drafting of all six-year olds, War
ner is attempting to push a rider 
through with his suggestion. He
will ask the Congress to pass along 
with the new draft law a stipula
tion which makes it mandatory 
for all sixteen-year-old youths to 
enroll at Carnegie Tech when they 
are released from the service.
Explaining this move Warner 
said, We will be able to indoc
trinate them with the Carnegie 
Plan which teaches them how to 
learn by themselves. This will be 
necessary, because they will have 
a lot of learning to catch up on 
in a short time.

Chestys Tally 101st Straight Loss 
In Bid For New National Record
With their inimitable feminine touch the 1951 edition of the Car
negie Chestys took the table Saturday night and continued their drive 
for a new national record as they were defeated 5-4 by a hard-fight
ing group of pre-med chess players from nearby W. & J.
The loss, the first of the year,^----------------------------------------------------
Flash !
extended the consecutive winless 
streak to 101 for the Strapless 
Skibos, who need only three more 
defeats to match the record of 104 
get by their arch-rivals, Pitt, in 
1940. Athletics are on the upgrade 
again at Carnegie and interest is 
at a fever pitch as the students 
hope for the Chestys to come 
through in their bid for national 
recognition.
The improved showing of the 
Tech chess team in the last few 
years can be directly attributed 
to the Steffen fund. The stipula
tion in the Steffen fund that all 
males on the team must maintain 
a 4.05 factor and make the AllState chess team has enabled the 
girls to take over. The change 
has resulted in the present amaz
ing record of 101 straight defeats 
since 1938 for the chess-ier ladies 
who have improved the mediocre 
500-4 win-loss record of the men 
at that time.
The latest match with Washing
ton & Jefferson was a battle for 
the Tartaa Sweater Girls as the 
pre-meds threatened for a while to lose. The Chestys started off 
by giving two knights to a bishop, 
but their opponents came right 
back and gav< away four pawns
for free. Things looked bad for 
the Strapless Skibos as their 
queen tried to let the black king 
catch her and he kept running 
away.
At the halfway mark of the 
contest the Chestys were down 
3-2 to the men from W. & J.; and 
as they sized up their opponents, 
they knew they were in for a 
tight match.
In the first maneuver after the 
half, the Presidents "from W. & J. 
justified Chestj fears. When the 
Carnegie King moved into castle, 
the pre-meds rooked it into tak
ing their queen because the bishop 
was near. The Chestys were 
downfallen as they took two more 
pawns without a loss.
In one brilliant move, however, 
the Carnegie girls came through 
to win the match. When a pawn 
was near, they moved their queen 
next to the W. & J. king and left 
their own in checkmate. The loss 
was greeted by the Chestys with 
a sigh of relief as they kept their 
record intact and upheld the 
honor of Carnegie.
The strapless Skibos have high 
hopes for the rest of the season 
as they look forward to six more 
matches they should lose. The 
only opponents they have to fear 
are the P. C. W. Vampsgirls 
who know how to let a king take 
a queen too.

Jelly Roll Moore, Dick Holl, 
uZombie Mitchell In Rare Form
Fifteen thousand Mexican athletes crowded the Ladies Room of 
the ever-popular University Grill in the wee hours of April 1 to 
watch a snake-eyed Carnegie sextet trim an inexperienced group of 
non-union crap shooters from PU by a 11-7 count.
---------------------------------------------- ? Coached by Bonehead Zuch,
who starred on the Anthropology 
A. and M. cube team in the sensa
tional seasons following the pass
ing of the Eighteenth Amendment, 
the Skibo Scalpers pulled ahead in 
the final round of the tight tour
nament due to their long hours of 
preseason practice.
More Crap 
Paced by Captain Greasy 
Thumb Lunt, with his pneu
matic knee pads, the Techsters 
rolled them naturally, one after 
another. Jelly Roll Moore was the 
man of the hour as he kept bring
ing back Little Phoebe for eight 
straight passes. The Tartans fum
bled the bones in the second 
rpund, but IA senior Holl, using 
Dohertys Principle, let loose with 
more crap than anyone has seen 
around here in a long time.
After guzzling four rounds from 
the Tech Bowl, the contest got 
under way with B-B eyes Bickleman leading off with a hot seven 
followed by box cars. Fresh from 
the inverted Mine Shaft, Peter 
Cropazinsky, the Pitt captain, got 
red hot at this point. Four Big 
Dicks and a pair of Little Joes 
shot the Panthers ahead in the 
arly rounds.
Pitt Craps Out 
Finger Fillip Flad, after crapp
ing out on three successive rolls, 
kissed the African golf-balls to 
set off a spree which brought the 
Carnegie bona rollers back into 
the game. Betting on the come, 
Senator Goofauver, who had set 
the stage for the match by repeal
ing Ohms Law, cleaned up 
enough to buy baby a new pair 
of shoes.
In a brief pause that refreshes, 
two fifths of Scotch and a pint of 
Schenleys inspired the boys from 
the Oakland Boys Club, while the 
Pitt team faltered from the effects 
of their West Virginia home brew. 
As the bones got hot again, Dick 
Holl's comeback featured the Tar
tan assault.
Call Halt
After sweeping the floor clear 
with her beautiful, brunnete 
Fuller-brush locks, Dolores Zom
bie Mitchell, rolling in the clean
up position, clinched the match, 
among other things, by ripping off 
seven passes interrupted by a sol
itary crap.
As the dusky gloom of the 
smoke filled alcoholic atmosphere 
tickened and the players began to 
see too many spots before their 
eyes, the click of the galloping 
dominoes was stilled by umpire 
Wleghadropolus (the Greek to 
you) as he called the affair to an 
end due to the round corners of 
the dice.

Appearing before the board, 
Callem Wright, a member of the 
Independent team, charged that 
Alpha Cholera and several other 
fraternity teams have been main
taining their winning ways only 
through skullduggery and nefari
ous methods.
Offer Proof 
Wright said the Independents 
have conclusive proof of Alpha 
Choleras guilt. As evidence he 
offered three ping-pong balls used 
by his team in a recent match 
with the Alphas which they lost 
21-0, 21-0, 21-0. These balls,
Wright said, had been weighted 
with lead so they wouldnt bounce 
In a softball game with Delta 
Thi, Wright said his team had dis
covered afterwards in the locker 
room that their bats had holes in 
them. The Delta This were also 
accused of switching the balls on 
the Independent pitchers. Wright j 
charged the softball their oppo
nents substituted was only an 
enlarged golf ball, which en
abled the DTs to hit 67 home runs.
Violate Amendment 
President Blah of Alpha Cholera 
when called before the Commit
tee to answer the charges refused 
to testify on the grounds that there 
wasnt any television. R. Gone, 
representative of Delta Thi, dis
missed the Independent charges 
on the grounds they were mad 
because they had lost a keg of 
beer on the softball game. Gone 
called the Independent accusations 
false, malicious, and misleading.
The Committee, upon hearing 
the testimony of all parties con
cerned, promptly clapped Blah, 
Gone, and Wright into detention 
upon charges of violating the 18th 
Amendment. Committee Head 
Ralph Stone said the defendants, 
all seniors, would probably lose 
social privileges at the Greeks for 
the rest of the year and then be 
sentenced to a year in the Korean 
salt mines.

Dorm Council Is Considering 
Supervision of Frosh Hazing
The annual freshman prayers for rain beneath Morewood Gar
dens windows may become a thing of the past if Dorm Councils 
hopes for altering the hazing stunt to something less hazardous are 
fulfilled. No formal discussion of the matter has as yet taken place,
but DC leaders are considering' 
taking over the stunt in the near 
future.
Dance Outlook Good
Although the Morewood Gar
dens showers of the past have 
been spontaneous affairs and in no 
way related to Council activities, 
the organization has taken an in
terest in the hazing project, plan
ning to change it to something 
somewhat less dangerous and ex
pensive. No preliminary plans 
have been made, but compulsory 
attendance at next years grid 
opener has been suggested as a 
possibility.
The spring dance, which is to 
be a semi-formal at the Hotel 
Webster Hall Ballroom, has excit
ed enough interest that there is 
a possibility of a shortage of 
tickets. The method of ticket dis
tribution has not yet been stated, 
but probably will be revealed 
sometime this week.
Pick King Candidates
As previously announced, the 
affair will be free to all dorm men 
and their dates. No flowers neces
sary.
The last Council meeting 
brought DCs decision to enter the 
King of Hearts campaign. The 
candidate will be Joe Simmons. 
Also discussed was the possibility 
of carrying on dormitory activi
ties through the summer semester 
if responsible leadership is avail
able.
Kappa Sigma 
Voted Winner 
Of Greek Sing
In a recent letter to the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents Mr. Henry 
Ready, one of the judges for this 
years Greek Sing, made public an 
error in the scoring of Kappa 
Sigma Fraternity. The corrected 
scoring places Kappa Sigma as 
winner of Sing. The following is 
a quote from Mr. Readys letter:
. . . My scqre should read 23 
for interpretationnot 13. Upon 
examination of my overall score 
for this organization, it will be no
ticed that I had scored in the area 
of excellent in all departments ex
cept interpretation. It goes with
out saying that any club which 
indicates excellent work in fac
tors of tone quality, diction, in
tonation, etc., would not be in
ferior in interpretation, for the 
latter is involved in the former.
On receipt of theletter, the 
Council considered four courses of 
action:
(1) Make public the corrected 
scores and take no further 
action.
(2) Accept the new scores and 
correct the trophy awards.
(3) Have the first, second and 
third ranking mens groups 
sing over.
(4) Use the recordings of Sing to 
re judge the groups.
With the first three ranking 
groups abstaining, it was voted 
unanimously to accept the second 
course of action. Correct rankings 
now are Kappa Sigma, first; Delta 
Upsilon, second; and Sigma Nu, 
third.
Ralph Snyder,
Chairman, Greek Sing.

Schober, Tancill High Scorers With Eleven;
Championship Second Straight For Nonames'
In the feature sports event of the Intramural Night festivities, 
the Emanon floor team won the campus basketball championship by 
swamping Kappa Sigma, 43-32. It marked the third consecutive year 
that Emanon had gained the finals of the annual court tourney, and

are due tomorrow, April 
while softball rosters are to be

Friday, April 6. The deadline 
is 5 p.m. on these dates.
the powerful independent organi
zation emerged victorious.
Led by Dick Schober, the "Nonames jumped off to a 14-5 first 
quarter advantage, and were never 
headed thereafter. Schober took 
high-point honors for the winners 
with a total of 11, eight of them 
coming in the first period. Motter 
and Tancill also tallied 11 mark
ers to pace the losers attack.
Stave Beta Rally
Emanon earned the right to play 
in the finals by downing Beta 
Theta Pi in a semi-final game by 
a 34-2C margin. Again the school 
champs led all the way, but had 
to stave-off a fourth quarter rally 
by the scrappy Beta five.
Kappa Sigma gained the finals 
by upending the Citcom Omicrons 
by a 40-32 score. The Omicrons 
gave the Kappa Sigs quite a bat
tle during the second half, match
ing score for score with the win
ners, but didn't have enough to 
overcome the 18-10 halftime lead 
piled-up by the Clyde Street en
try.
Third Quarter Tie
In the quarter-finals the Betas 
eliminated the Little Sekuds, 
39-36, despite 16 points by Tex 
Richards, giant pivot man of the 
losing squad.
The other quarter-final game 
saw the Omicrons down the Raid
ers by a 31-24 count. The Raid
ers, trailing all the way, battled 
to a 22-22 deadlock at the end of 
the third period but fell apart in 
the final stanza.
Emanon Defeats DUs 
For IM Bowling Title
Last Saturday afternoon Emanon and Delta Upsilon met at the 
University Recreation alleys to decide the school champion in the 
1951 intramural bowling tournament. The new kingpin champs are 
the high-scoring Emanon aggregation.

Head League 
In Handball
The intramural handball contest 
was put into high gear during the 
last week of school before vaca
tion as eight matches were played.
The play'during this period was 
dominated mainly by the Beavers 
and the men of Delta Tau Delta 
as they won four matches and 
three matches respectively.
The Beavers, led by Goldman, 
Reamey, and Kirschner swept 
through matches with the Phi 
Kaps, Tau Delta Phi, Alpha Tau 
Omega, and Theta Xi to gain their 
first four victories of the season 
and secure the first place position 
with a perfect 4-0 record.
The Delt team, led by John 
Montstream and Don Braun, beat 
the SAEs by a 3-0 count to knotch 
their first victory. Wins over the I 
ATOs and the TXs by 2-0 and j 
2-1 counts gave the second place 
Delts their second and third wins i 
of the season.

teams compiled high scores for the 
five game series. Emanon got off 
to a good start as they swept 
through the first three games to 
hold an advantage of 225 pins at 
this point.
The final two games were a 
complete reversal of the first three, 
however, as the DUs came charg
ing back to whittle that lead down 
to a mere 23 pins at the end of 
the series. The final score in total 
pins was 3977 to 3954 in Emanons 
favor.
Demaria and Majercik paced the 
victors as they rolled series scores 
of 845 and 840 respectively to 
give them average scores of 169 
and 168 each. For the losers it 
was Walt Thompson and Ralph 
McNatt who led the way with 
scores of 803 and 785 respectively.
Considering all the facts, the 
match was a well played contest, 
both teams displaying scores usu
ally associated with championship 
encounters. Both Majercik and 
Demaria gained entrance to the 
charmed circle of bowlers as they 
rolled games of 208 and 204 dur
ing the match.
In the semi-final playoff games, 
the Emanons downed the Phi Kaps 
and the DUs beat out the team of 
Beta Theta Pi.

At the half the WAA had in
creased its lead to 21-15. The

NATIONAL 
ARROW WEEK
celebrating Arrow's 100 Years 
of style leadership
Campus _these past 100 years, baciv 
there were only 160 colleges in the 
entire country. Today, there are 
1,84>9. No Rose Bowl game at the 
end of the football season in 
those days. No football season as 
a matter of fact. Open surreys were 
standard equipment of college 
Romeosthere wasnt a creamcolored convertible on the 
landscape. It was then, a century 
ago, that Arrow started manu
facturing their famous collars ... 
and in a few years they were 
setting campus styles. Thats one 
thing that hasnt changed. Arrow 
is still style leader on Americas 
campuses. ollege men every
where know that the Arrow label 
always stands for smart styles, fine
fabrics, meticulous tailoring . . .

Evening Engineering Banquet 
Set For Saturday, April 21
On Saturday evening, April 21, the Evening College of Engineer
ing and Science of the Carnegie Institute of Technology will sponsor 
its 36th annual banquet. This affair will be held in the Gold Room of 
the Roosevelt Hotel at 6:00 p. m.^
Byron May, banquet chairman, 
and his assistant, Bill Bartoli. have 
received many favorable replies 
to their requests for souvenirs and 
door prizes. They both feel sure 
that everyone attending the ban
quet will stagger away from the 
Gold Room; due to the weight of 
the souvenirs.
This affair is always the high
light of the evening school calen
dar and, if the precedent estab
lished in past years is to be a cri
terion, the coming banquet will be 
a grand success.
Byron and Bill inform us that a 
fine array of talent will be present 
to assure an evening of pleasant 
and interesting entertainment.
' Tickets can be obtained at Dalziel McKelways office, IH-235B 
or from Evening Student Council 
members for the nominal fee of 
$4.50 per ticket.
