Bus service not reduced in September, Port Authority says
by Maria Zayas
Staffwriter
Contrary to what was written in The 
Tartans Sept. 10 article, Port Authority 
reduces bus service by 10 percent, the 
Port Authority of Allegheny County did 
not further reduce their service in Sep
tember as originally planned. Thanks to 
Act 44, which was passed in July and will 
allow for the tolling of 1-80 as a source of
revenue. The Port Authority was able to 
receive sufficient funding to eliminate 
its $80 million deficit.
Although legislation has been released 
forbidding the tolling of federal high
ways, the Port Authority will continue to 
move ahead with Act 44.
Congress hasnt begun to consider 
[the opposing legislation] yet, and so 
weremoving forward, said Robert 
Grove, Port Authority director of media 
relations.
The Pennsylvania Transportation 
Funding and Reform Commission, di
rected in 2005 to investigate the funding 
crisis faced by Pennsylvanias highway, 
bridge, and transit systems, produced 
a full report addressing problems and 
calling on the Port Authority to reform 
its policies. Along with Act 44, the Port 
Authority has taken several other steps 
to pull itself out of a deficit and to ad
dress the Pennsylvania Transportation 
Funding and Reform Commissions call
for business reforms. The Port Author
ity held a series of six public workshops 
to evaluate the efficiency of rail and bus 
services.
As a result, the Port Authority in
stituted a broad series of cost-saving 
initiatives.
One of these is Connect 09, an 18- 
month initiative that hopes to connect 
individual neighborhoods with the 
larger Pittsburgh region by allowing 
all regional operators to pick up and
discharge patrons throughout all of Al
legheny County. For this, they plan on 
enhancing the coordination of transit 
services and adopting a regional fare 
collection system based on smart card 
technology.
With this project, the Port Authority 
hopes to prove that it will be able to run 
as efficiently as possible once it receives 
new funding, such as toll revenues from

Facebook listings 
take on the World 
[Wide Web]
by AkshayDave
Junior Staffwriter
At the start of September, Facebook an
nounced that it will give non-members limited 
access to user profiles. Now, almost anyone 
will now be able to look up any profile.
The expansion is to allow non-Facebook us
ers to find their friends on Facebook without 
having to register for the service themselves, 
according to a Sept. 5 Facebook blog post by 
company engineer Philip Fung.
Within a few days, Facebook will allow all 
public listings to be indexed by search engines 
such as Google and Yahoo!. This means that a 
users listing will be in the crawlers databases 
and anyone with an Internet connection can 
search for anyones name and anyones profile 
pictures.
The blog post goes on to state that public 
search listings display less information than 
it would to registered members, and thus 
more people will find it easier to connect to 
their friends, without any extra information 
being revealed.
In the last three years, Facebook has grown 
into one of the countrys most visited websites 
and, with over 30 million unique users, one of 
the biggest, according to www.alexa.com.
Carnegie Mellon faculty believe that there 
are both advantages and disadvantages to 
sites like Facebook.
Social networking websites are fantas
tic tools [which] mold self-identity, said 
Alessandro Acquisti, assistant professor of 
technology in the Heinz School of Public 
Policy and Management. Of course, there 
are limits, defined by the law, the competi
tion, company ethics, but most importantly 
by what the consumers want. Facebook has 
become more open in the last few months. 
But, it has also given users more control and 
evidently they seem happy.
In 2005, Acquisti, along with computer 
science Ph.D. student Ralph Gross, jointly sub
mitted a research paper outlining the privacy 
issues that are relevant to Facebook users.
Students tend to have misconceptions 
about profile viewability [and dont realize 
that] a lot of their information they put up 
online may not be as safe they would hope, 
Acquisti said.
Students on campus have different opin
ions about the value of Facebook.
I have never used Facebook and dont in
tend to in the future either. I have heard too 
many bad things about it, said Arash Moradivafa, a first-year student in H&SS.
Students should avoid displaying personal 
information such as address, telephone 
numbers and birthdays, experts warn.

When first-year Science and Humani
ties Scholar Ariel Rosenburg celebrated 
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, a 
little more than a week ago, she e-mailed 
her professors two weeks in advance about 
missing class and making up assignments. 
She discovered that not all professors were 
equal when dealing with her absences. 
While some gladly granted her extensions 
in turning in work, others did not allow her 
to make up any work afterward.
The educational environment should 
not make you feel guilty about practicing 
your religion, Rosenburg said. Professors 
should not put students in a position where 
they have to make difficult choices. The 
university should not necessarily make ex
ceptions, but be accommodating.
Last summer, the University of 
Michigan-Dearborn decision to install 
footbaths in two campus bathrooms to ac
commodate the universitys large Muslim 
population was met with controversy. Some 
activists believed the installations were a 
violation of the First Amendment, which 
mandates the separation of church and 
state. As a private institution, Carnegie Mel
lon is not subject to the First Amendment in 
the same way as UMich. However, since the 
university is officially not affiliated with a 
particular religion but its population is rep
resentative of many diverse religious views, 
students and faculty have a wide range of 
opinions regarding the ways in which reli
gion should, and shouldnt, manifest itself 
on campus.
Since the university has no official policy 
regarding religious holidays, professors 
deal with absences during these times in 
varying ways.
Religion outside the classroom is another 
matter.
Of Carnegie Mellons 225 recognized 
student clubs and organizations, 17 are 
religiously or spiritually oriented, accord
ing to Gina Casalegno, director of student 
activities.
Some non-religious students think this 
may be too many.

On Tuesday, professor Randy Pausch instructed a crowd of 450 in McConomy Auditorium on 
how to lead their lives. Pausch, a professor of computer science and design and co-founder of 
the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), stressed that everyone can achieve their childhood 
dreams if they try hard enough, but that it is more important to help others achieve their 
dreams also. This optimistic stand was more poignant coming from Pausch, who found last year 
that he has pancreatic cancer, and recently was told he had only one to five months to live.

Last December, Pittsburgh Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahl and Pittsburgh Public 
Schools Superintendent Mark Roosevelt 
announced the start of the Pittsburgh 
Promise, a guarantee to Pittsburgh 
public schools students that they 
would have money for college if they
fV $
met certain academic and behavioral 
requirements, such as avoiding 
disciplinary problems, attending class, 
and completing their homework.
While the program is expected to 
take effect for this years graduating 
class, the Promise looks like it may fall 
short due to funding problems.
In order for the Promise program 
to provide scholarships to all of its 
graduating seniors, the program would
need to raise between $5 million and $7 
million each year.
As of the end of August, the 
program had only $10,000, donated 
by the Pittsburgh Federation of 
Teachers, to give to the class of 2008, 
according to an Aug. 29 article from 
thepittsburghchannel.com.
The Pittsburgh Promise is modeled 
after a similar program initiated 
in Kalamazoo, Mich., according to
www.thetartan.org
a Dec. 14 article in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette.
As a result of the Kalamazoo program, 
both school attendance and real estate 
sales increased. If the Promise program 
succeeds in Pittsburgh, the city may 
experience similar benefits.
While Carnegie Mellon Director of 
Admissions Michael Steidel does not 
believe that Carnegie Mellon will benefit 
from this plan, he does see the overall
Bus v
benefits of the programs success.
I think the long term benefit is a 
better Pittsburgh school system, he 
said. Increasing the quality of our 
schools will only benefit the region 
and the students graduating from city 
schools.
In general, there will most likely be 
an increase in the number of students

Open house promotes Decathalon
On Sept. 27, Carnegie Mellon hosted an 
open house for the universitys solar house. 
The event was designed to give students and 
the public the opportunity to explore this 
years entry in the Solar Decathlon, a competi
tion that challenges students to create a fully 
functional house that derives enough energy 
from the sun to power an average household 
or business. Local and state legislators were 
in attendance, including City Councilman 
Bill Peduto and Richard King of the United 
States Department of Energy, director of the 
competition.
Twenty schools from across the United 
States, Canada, and Europe are chosen to par
ticipate in the Decathlon, which takes place 
on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The 
team with the most points after a series of 10 
competitions is declared the winner.
Carnegie Mellon participated in the firstever Solar Decathlon in 2002.' In 2005, 
Carnegie Mellon began collaborating with 
University of Pittsburgh and The Art Institute 
of Pittsburgh under the name Pittsburgh 
Synergy. That same year, Carnegie Mellon 
began working with Technische Universitt 
Darmstadt (TUD) in Darmstadt, Germany. 
This year, Carnegie Mellon and TUD have both 
submitted separate plans to the Decathlon, 
but will share adjacent lots on the National 
Mall and have designed a shared deck be
tween them.
This years Solar Decathlon Competition 
will take place Oct. 12 through Oct. 20.

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 24, 2007
H&SS OnTues dasy 
,prauo fRRP
The faculty and staff of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences 
congratulate the following students for their outstanding academic 
performances during the Spring 2007 semester.
Professor Randy Pausch tells students to 
never give up, despite the odds
Port Authority cancels additional service reductions and opts 
for new initiatives to eliminate $80 million deficit
BUS, from A1
1-80.
Only non-represented employ
ees, those not under a union, 
were affected by the cost-saving 
initiatives. Over 90 percent of 
Port Authority employees are 
unionized.
The Port Authority acceler
ated the departure of employees 
in a Deferred Retirement Op
tions plan, and eliminated both 
lifetime health care and their 
$500 monthly pension plans.
By June 30, the Port Author
ity had eliminated 374 budgeted
positions and instituted 203 
layoffs.
Port Authoritys next step is to 
address legacy costs, the obliga
tion to pay pensions and health 
care costs for both retirees and 
current employees as part of 
those employees benefits plan.
To make the necessary 
changes, the Port Authority 
must hold a series of collective 
bargaining talks with labor 
unions. The talks have yet to 
formally begin, but the Port Au
thority insists that they will be 
scheduled sometime before the 
union agreement expires Jan. 1,
2008.
Much of our cost structure 
has to be addressed through 
cost bargaining. We do have 
the unilateral power to change 
management and pension plans, 
which we changed six months 
ago. Were doing everything 
we can on the managerial end, 
and our goal is to gain a lot of 
savings in the collective bargain
ing agreement that is coming 
up with the several workers 
unions, Grove said.
A fare increase will take ef
fect Jan. 1, 2008, but the Port 
Authority has yet to determine
the amount of the raise or the 
fare structure.
However, in order to gain ex
pected millions more in revenue, 
a Port Authority committee has 
proposed to raise the currently 
discounted ride fee for Carnegie 
Mellon and University of Pitts
burgh students. The University 
of Pittsburgh currently pays 
$282,000 per month for this ser
vice, and Carnegie Mellon pays 
$64,000 per month.
The proposal has recom
mended a 15 percent increase 
per year for five years. However, 
Carnegie Mellon has a reserve
to protect against a significant 
increase, and the university 
expects the student fee increase 
to fall under 15 percent.
The fee generally changes 
every year. In this case, I believe 
that we will be able to keep the 
increase for next year at no more 
than $2 to $3 per semester, said 
Michael Murphy, associate vice 
president of enrollment services. 
Our current reserve will allow 
us to keep the student fee below 
the 15 percent, likely between 5 
and 10 percent.
Murphy expects the Port 
Authority to authorize the 15
percent increase by Friday. Car
negie Mellon will hold further 
discussions in October before 
signing any final agreement.
The the new agreement will 
take effect in November.
We have had a very posi
tive relationship with the Port 
Authority, and it is clear that 
students value the service, 
Murphy said. PAT [Port Au
thority] has been clear for some 
time that our negotiated fee was 
well below their standard fare, 
and that at some point we would 
need to increase our negotiated 
rate.

Junior Staffwriter
Within the first few statements 
of his lecture, titled Really 
Achieving Your Childhood 
Dreams, Randy Pausch illus
trated that he plans to live the 
time he has left to the fullest.
We cant change the cards we 
are dealt, just how we play the 
hand. If Im not as depressed as 
you think I should be, Im sorry 
to disappoint you, said Pausch, 
who was diagnosed a little over a 
year ago with pancreatic cancer. 
Doctors recently told him he only 
has five months to live.
Pausch, a professor of com
puter science and design and 
co-founder of the Entertain
ment Technology Center (ETC), 
stressed that everyone can 
achieve their childhood dreams 
if they try hard enough, but that 
it is more important to help oth
ers achieve their dreams also.
The lecture contained both 
humor and wisdom as Pausch ex
plained that others can get past 
the brick walls (things that get 
in the way of their dreams), just 
as he did, and, like him, achieve 
all their goals.
Pauschs determination to help 
others is reflected in the impact 
he has had on his students and all 
students who went through the 
ETC program. Laura Pliskin, who 
will graduate in December with 
a masters degree in entertain
ment technology, said she might 
still be working in retail were it 
not for Pausch, though she never 
had him as a professor.
I had earned my undergradu
ate degree in art, but had a hard 
time finding a job, Pliskin said. 
She met Pausch when he was 
shopping for an anniversary 
gift for his parents at the store 
where she worked, EngraveYard. 
Pausch told her about the ETC, 
a graduate program that he had 
co-founded with Don Marinelli, 
the executive producer, in 1998.
The ETC, as Pausch said in 
his lecture, involves artists and 
technologists working in small 
teams to make things, mean
ing that the ETC strives to create 
media that focuses on both its 
artistic and technological quali
ties. In addition to the ETC, the 
professor also developed Alice, 
interactive software that helps 
students learn computer pro
gramming in a hands-on and 
engaging manner.
Although Pausch had a hand 
in many of Carnegie Mellons 
classes and programs, in his lec
ture the professor encouraged 
students to focus on others, not 
[themselves].
Randy encouraged us to be 
forces for good. There are enough 
people out there making zombie 
extermination games, said Phil 
Light, a student of Pauschs who 
graduated last spring from the 
ETC.
Light and two teammates 
started Electric Owl Studios, 
a company devoted to making 
electronic toys that entertain 
children while they are under
going a hospital visit or cancer 
treatment.
Another of Pauschs students, 
Mark Tomczak, who graduated 
in 2005 with a B.S. degree in 
computer science, took Pauschs 
class Building Virtual Worlds 
as an undergraduate student. 
He currently works to create 
training worlds for occupations 
such as firefighters and police 
officers.
Randy believes people are 
capable of more than they think 
they are, and encouraged us to 
push as far as we could, Tomc
zak said.
Tomczak couldnt have 
taken Building Virtual Worlds 
without Pauschs help, he ex
plained. It was Pausch who 
convinced administrators that 
undergraduate students were 
capable of handling the courses 
graduate-level coursework and 
should be allowed to have access 
to the course.
The only reason there are 
undergrads in there is because 
Randy believed in us, Tomczak 
said. It was the single greatest 
experience I had in my educa
tional career.
At the end of the lecture, 
Pausch posed a final question to 
the audience.
Have you figured out the 
head-fake? he asked.
A head-fake, he explained 
earlier, occurs when someone 
is taught a deeper lesson under 
the pretense of learning some
thing simple  when a high 
school football player learns 
determination, teamwork, and 
perseverance while seeming 
to learn a proper three-point 
stance, for instance.
Give up?
Its not about how to achieve 
your dreams, Pausch said. Its 
about how to lead your life.

Humanities Scholar Kelly Stew
art is agnostic, she acknowl
edged that religious clubs could 
enrich some students college ex
periences. However, she said she 
was was surprised and frankly, 
appalled that no such clubs ex
isted for atheists, agnostics, or 
those who question.
Rosenburg feels that religion is 
an important part of campus life, 
but agrees that no student should 
have to unwillingly support reli
gious organizations.
I definitely dont think [reli
gious clubs] should be funded 
by our student activities fees, 
Rosenburg said.
Student Senate, which receives 
10 percent of the student activi
ties fee  $75,000 this year  to 
allocate to student organizations, 
usually refrains from funding 
religious groups, according to 
Jared Itkowitz, Student Senate 
chair and junior business ad
ministration and Chinese studies 
major.
In the past, the funding of 
religious and political events 
has been contentious inso
much as we would prefer not to 
fund events that promote a cer
tain ideology or discriminate 
[against] students with a certain 
belief, Itkowitz said. However, 
there are no official guidelines 
for spending the activities funds,
so requests are dealt with on an 
individual basis, Itkowitz said.
The Joint Funding Commit
tee (JFC), which allocates nearly 
$1 million of students activities 
fees among recognized student 
organizations, has bylaws that 
prevent it from funding aca
demic, political, and/orreligious 
clubs, Casalegno said.
For the first time this year, how
ever, the JFC considered making 
spiritually oriented groups eli
gible to receive money to hold 
secular events.
Om, a spiritual organization 
for Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs, is 
the first group to benefit from this 
new policy. The group received 
$1642 to spend on events which
can provide cultural enrichment 
and enjoyment for all students.
[These events are] historically 
well attended, Casalegno said.
The two events that will be 
funded by the JFC this year are 
Navrathri, a dance through which 
Hindus celebrate female divinity, 
and Holi, a northern Indian fes
tival during which participants 
splatter colored powders on each 
other to celebrate the coming of 
spring, according to Gautam Daswani, Om president and senior 
business administration major.
These events are
representation [s] of Indias cul
ture and heritage but do not 
have heavily religious signifi
cance, Daswani said.
'Pittsburgh Promise program lacks funds
PROMISE, from Al
from the Pittsburgh area who are 
applying to college, Steidel said. 
He did not believe that there 
would be a noticeable increase 
in applicants to Carnegie Mellon 
in particular.
The main target audience 
impacted will be those that are
considering whether or not to 
even go to college ... this is not 
the audience that is typically 
attracted to schools like 
Carnegie Mellon, Steidel said.
To promote the benefits of 
a college education, Carnegie 
Mellon sends representatives 
to local city high schools and 
sponsors outreach programs
such as College Success 101, 
held in May.
[We] bus local students to 
Carnegie Mellon to get an entire 
day of college admission advice 
and counseling, Steidel said of 
the program.
One goal of the program is 
to increase the rate of students 
in the Pittsburgh public schools
who attend college, according to 
a Dec. 14 article in the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review. The current 
rate, 70.5 percent, is lower than 
the state average of 75.3 percent, 
the article reported.

It is common knowledge that 
you have to be sensible when 
posting any information on the

carefully check their settings, 
said Jessica Wille, a sophomore

Acquisti agreed.
Default settings are probably 
the most important responsibil

of the people never bother to 
even read through these set
tings, he said.
Facebook users can protect 
their public listings from being

Most importantly, Acquisti 
reminded students that on
line profiles can be viewed as 
a form of self-advertisement, 
and students should remember 
that the material displayed on 
their profile contributes to the

Professor 
receives 
award
by Marium Chandna
Junior Staffwriter
At the 2007 annual TechCon technology conference, 
professor Wojciech P. Maly of 
the electrical and computer 
engineering (ECE) depart
ment received the Aristotle 
Award from the Semiconductor 
Research Corporation.
Founded in 1996, the Aristotle 
Award is intended to recognize 
research professors who have 
had a profound impact on the 
education of their students.
Maly earned this award in 
recognition of his pioneer
ing teaching methods and 
groundbreaking research in the 
semiconductor integrated cir
cuit (IC) industry.
This award has been given 
to three professors, including 
Maly, in the ECE department.
According to Malys website, 
Malys research focuses on in
terfaces between VLSI design, 
testing, and manufacturing, 
with the stress on the stochastic 
nature of phenomena relating 
these three VLSI domains.
The IC industry focuses on the 
properties of and complexities 
associated with the fabrication 
of semiconductor integrated 
circuits, and Maly has been 
especially concerned with the 
industrys manufacturing costs.
Maly said, A sum of 
four billion U.S. dollars has 
been allocated to build the fab
rication line.
During his career, Maly has 
published numerous research 
papers, many of which have 
focused on the design, testing, 
and yield of integrated circuits.
Maly gives full credit for this 
award to his team of hardwork
ing, talented, and dedicated 
individuals, both students 
and faculty members. He also 
expresses thanks to Carnegie 
Mellon for providing him with 
an environment to view the

Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
CyLab will be hosting the second 
annual Anti-Phishing Working 
Group e-crime Researchers Sum
mit on Oct. 4-5, a meeting that 
will address the security threats 
in online multiplayer games and 
phishing on the World Wide Web.
Sponsored by the Anti-Phishing 
Working Group, an organization 
that fights phishing and crimeware, the summit will include the 
appearances of top experts who 
are involved in electronic crime 
(e-crime) research. One of these 
experts will be Carnegie Mellons Lorrie Cranor, an associate 
research professor of computer 
science, who is the general chair 
for the conference.
Gary McGraw, the chief tech
nology officer of Cigital Inc., will 
deliver a keynote address about 
security threats that are posed 
by online multi-player computer 
games like World ofWarcraft.
With hundreds of thousands 
of interacting users, McGraw 
stated on the eCrime Research 
website, todays online games 
are a bellwether of modern soft
ware yet to come. The kinds of 
attack and defense techniques I 
[will] describe are tomorrows se

The summit will cover a 
number of topics relating to on
line security threats, including 
those posed by massive multi
player online role-playing games 
(MMORPGs) and phishing. The
conference will also touch on the 
precautions needed to prevent eCrime and ways to determine the 
risk of a particular threat.
With regard to MMORPGs, 
the summit will touch on how 
these games can cause security 
breaches involving the private 
and financial accounts of players 
around the world.
In a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, McGraw claimed that

How Things Work: Auroras
Akanksha Vaidya
An aurora is a natural light 
display observed in the night 
sky. During an aurora, the sky 
lights up on its own in a multi
tude of colors, ranging from red 
to green to purple. Glowing col
ors in the sky pulsate gently and 
grow bigger and bigger until 
they fill the entire sky.
Auroras occur mostly in the 
regions around the north and 
south poles.
Auroras observed in the 
northern hemisphere are com
monly called northern lights, 
but their scientific name is 
Aurora Borealis. This name 
is derived from the Roman god
dess of dawn, Aurora, and the 
Greek term for north wind, Bo
realis.
The auroras observed in the 
southern hemisphere are called 
Aurora Australis.
If one were to compare au
roras to fireworks, one could 
say that the ammunition for 
the auroras is provided by the 
sun. To understand how the 
sun comes into the picture, one 
must first go back to Earths 
structure.
Earth can be viewed as a 
huge magnet. Like all magnets, 
Earth has a magnetic field that 
extends from it. In particular, 
magnetic field lines surround 
the earth, entering at the south 
pole and exiting at the north 
pole.
The north and south poles are 
the magnetic poles of Earth. The 
region around Earth to which 
Earths magnetic field extends is 
called Earths magnetosphere.
Another magnetic layer 
around Earth is called the iono
sphere. The ionosphere forms 
the inner edge of the magne
tosphere. The ionosphere is 
ionized by solar radiations and
contains a large number of free 
electrons and protons.
Such a mixture of protons 
and electrons in space is called 
plasma. Plasma can conduct 
electricity, which is essential to 
the occurrence of auroras.
The outermost part of the at
mosphere of the sun is called the 
corona, which is the ring that is 
visible during a solar eclipse.
The suns corona is associated 
with a magnetic field, and be
cause magnetic fields are known 
to be formed due to moving 
charges, one can infer that the
corona consists of plasma.
Furthermore, the sun has a 
high gravitational force that 
pulls the corona inward. How
ever, because of the coronas 
high temperature, this gravi
tational force cannot hold the 
entire corona.
Consequently, jets of corona 
stream out from the sun. Such 
a jet of corona coming from the 
sun is called solar wind.
This solar wind speeds to
ward Earth, but Earth has a 
shield  its magnetic field  
against the solar wind. As a
Courtesy of Nick Russill Photography
result, a huge cavity is formed 
between Earth and the wind.
Though the magnetosphere 
blocks the solar wind, the so
lar wind still pushes its way 
around the magnetosphere. 
In the process, it squeezes the 
magnetosphere.
The magnetosphere then ac
quires a contorted structure 
which is compressed on the day 
side of Earth (toward the sun), 
and it has a tail-like portion on 
the other side of Earth, which is 
called the magnetotail.
Although the Earths shield
keeps out a certain amount of 
solar energy, solar particles 
always manage to enter the 
magnetosphere through the 
magnetotail. These solar par
ticles then move toward the 
sun-side of the earth.
Now and then, this squeezing 
and extra charge due to solar 
particles gives rise to a buildup 
of pressure, and this pressure 
gives rise to an electric voltage 
between the magnetotail and 
the poles of Earth. This voltage 
can be as high as 100,000 volts.
This voltage pushes some of 
the lighter charged particles 
of the plasma that surrounds 
Earth along Earths magnetic 
field lines at a very high veloc
ity.
These charged particles then 
travel to Earths poles (where 
the field lines converge) and 
collide with atoms of gases in 
the ionosphere.
This collision imparts energy 
to the gas atoms, and the atoms 
become excited. The electrons 
in the atoms move up to higher 
energy levels because of the 
extra energy. They soon jump 
back to their original energy 
level (ground state), however, 
and release the energy that they 
absorbed.
The atoms release the energy 
in the form of light. Each light 
photon has a specific wave
length depending on the nature 
of the atom. The specific wave
length of the light determines 
the color of the light.
Thus, the colors that are pro
duced depend on the gases that 
are present in the atmosphere.
Oxygen, for instance, is found 
in a high proportion in the 
higher atmosphere, and excita
tion of oxygen atoms releases 
green and red light.
This is why most auroras are 
colored red or green in the at
mosphere.

A team of Russian scientists, 
led by Vadim Tsytovich of Rus
sias General -Physics Institute 
in Moscow, claim that dust 
particles in space can assemble 
themselves into inorganic, life
like structures.
Though these new-found 
structures do not share any 
of the compound chemical 
processes of the most basic 
life-forms on Earth, their chem
ical makeup carries out generic 
biological actions of the organic 
system, such as growth and de
velopment. Moreover, genetic 
mutation and trait inheritance 
are also visible in these coiled 
formations.
As most scientists meet this 
claim with perplexity or dis
regard, Gregor Morfill of the 
Max Planck Institute for Extra
terrestrial Physics in Germany 
suggested that though the 
results are based on numeri
cal, computer-based models, 
dusty plasmas may satisfy the 
commonly accepted minimum 
conditions used to define life.

John Kanzius, a cancer 
researcher in Erie, Pa., has 
discovered that salt water can 
burn when exposed to radio fre
quencies for a certain length of 
time.
Kanzius claim was verified 
by Rustum Roy of Penn State 
University, who conducted his 
own experiments showing the 
separation of elements in salt 
water, and the discharge of hy
drogen from water, due to radio 
frequencies.
Since more than 70 percent of 
Earth is covered by salt water, 
scientists see this discovery as a

Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. in 
Japan has created a vacuum

cleaning chores in multina
tional organizations. The robot, 
which resembles a mini fridge 
on wheels, works during the 
night and uses the elevator to 
get to different floors.
These uniquely structured 
machines currently roam the 
floors of 10 buildings in Japan, 
even a 54-story skyscraper.
The robots are also a way 
to deal with the Japans aging

Pittsburgh receives award funds to carry out solar energy proposal
Experts plan e-crime discussions
city planning, technology selec
tion, project financing, bluilding 
codes, architecture, and commu
nity outreach communications. 
This is an award not to a re
search institution where you will 
fund a professor and a team of 
Ph.D. students to create some
thing new. It is very difficult to use 
federal funds to buy hardware, 
buy photovoltaic panels, and con
struct buildings, Lee said.
He added, This is an award to 
a city to provide soft support.
We are getting a decent 
amount of help from the Carnegie 
Mellon University. We have a cou
ple of representatives from the 
student body. It is nice to see so 
many students involved, Geary 
said.
As an initial step to adopting 
solar energy, Lee suggested that 
the city obtain energy from solar 
panels on the roofs of parking 
garages. He also suggested the 
city charge car-sharing program
vehicles with solar cells, making 
them free to use.
The utilization of the resources 
available remains an issue of local 
concern. Consequently, the city 
has created a task force, or steer
ing committee, that is in charge ol 
these funds. The committee con
sists of people who were involved 
in putting together the original 
proposal. Geary said that it meets 
once a month and is a fairly con
nected task force. Members work 
for eight to 10 hours a month to 
make it possible for Pittsburgh 
to really take advantage of the 
award.
Lee said, [The award] is 
money to bring together a group 
of people  academic [experts], 
government officials, private citi
zens, nonprofit organizations  
to the table to ask: We represent 
the city of Pittsburgh; What can 
we do to make Pittsburgh the so
lar city? 
on education and ECE research
SOLAR, from A6
Force representative, said that 
the award will help Pittsburgh 
create a plan to incorporate solar 
technology into the citys infra
structure.
According to Lee, the DOE 
would probably not give the award 
to a city that has no research insti
tution and no infrastructure.
They felt that here there is 
a great confluence of research 
universities, technical expertise, 
companies that build solar prod
ucts, companies that make green 
products, and so on, Lee said.
Geary said that Pittsburgh was 
chosen to become one of the Solar 
America Cities because it can help 
serve as a model for other cities 
on account of its size, electricity 
demand, geography, population, 
and commitment.
Each winninfg city is eligible for 
a maximum of $200,000 from the 
DOE. The cities are also provided
with technical assistance that 
will amount to $2 million in 2007 
and $600,000 in 2008.
According to Lee, the award is 
seed money that could lead to a 
greater plan for Pittsburgh.
Regarding the funds, Lee said, 
You can use the $200,000 of cash 
for capital purposes  you can
not buy solar panels with it, you 
cannot buy a building  but you 
can plan a building, you can hire 
a Solar America coordinator to be 
a staff person, call meetings, hire 
consultants, and do planning. It 
is a completely different scenario 
from what I had imagined.
Success of any of the programs 
is like a seed  you plant a seed 
and it grows into a tree. This 
is seed money to get a group of 
people together to plan and chart 
what their future can be.
According to the DOEs website, 
technical assistance is provided 
by the DOE, its national laborato
ries, and experts in areas such as
PITTSBURGH, from A6
curity of individual players and 
the welfare of the online gaming 
industry as a whole. McGraw will 
discuss both of these issues in his 
address.
Phishing, on the other hand, 
is classified as a type of fraud 
in which personal and finan
cial information is stolen from 
individuals via e-mails. These 
e-mails are often disguised as emails from financial institutions.
Several panelists from the 
Harvard Center for Research on 
Computation and Society, Indi
ana University, and People for the 
American Way will address the is
sue of phishing.
These panelists will focus on 
the potential for phishing to nega
tively impact the 2008 elections. 
They will also touch on ways to 
prevent phishing that have been 
used in the past.
In addition to addresses by 
experts in the field of crime re
search, the summit will feature 
research paper and poster pre
sentations.
These presentations are in
tended to inform attendees about
peoples reaction to phishing emails, as well as the usefulness 
of anti-phishing education. Of 
the different paper presentations 
that will be shown at the summit, 
Cranors Getting Users to Pay 
Attention to Anti-Phishing Edu
cation: Evaluation of Retention 
and Transfer will be among the 
featured readings.
Presentations will also cover 
the role that machine learning 
and the Internet play in phishing.
On a social and deployment 
side, said Markus Jakobsson, as
sociate professor of informatics at 
Indiana University and program 
chair of the summit, it is about 
raising awareness of the dire 
situation we are headed towards, 
and address problems before they 
turn into catastrophe.
Proposed methods of user edu
cation will also be addressed in 
the presentations.
One solution is to make it fun, 
said Cranor. Weve developed a 
game called Anti-Phishing Phil. 
...People seem to really enjoy 
playing the game and weve been 
contacted by several companies 
and the U.S. Air Force about us
ing it for employee training. In
addition to informative games, 
Cranors research team developed 
a method that utilizes cartoons to 
inform its audience.
Another thing we observed is 
that people who fall for phishing 
e-mails actually read them. So 
weve been experimenting with 
sending people fake phishing 
e-mails that we generate, said 
Cranor.
When they click on the link in 
the e-mail, we pop-up an educa
tional cartoon that teaches them 
about how to avoid falling for 
phishing attacks. Weve found it 
is very effective. Sending the car
toon to people directly in e-mail is 
not very effective, but if they see 
the cartoon after falling for our 
phish, it has a big impact.
This is not a battle that can be 
won by either side in a conclusive 
manner, said Jakobsson, and it 
is going to remain, but I have rea
sonable hope that we can control 
the problem better onwards.

Teamwork is the most beauti
ful, and rewarding aspect of my 
profession, he said. Maly also 
believes that knowledge, coupled 
with emotional freedom, is 
what produces the fruitful results 
he and his team have had.
In a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Anne Gattiker, who 
graduated from Carnegie Mellons ECE department in 1998, 
said, [Maly] taught us humility 
and showed us how to view the 
significance of our work.
Malys previous academic 
pursuits took him to study in 
Warsaw, Poland, where he earned 
his Ph.D. from the Institute of Ap
plied Cybernetics in 1975. That 
same year, Maly became an as
sistant professor at the Technical 
University of Warsaw.
Since becoming affiliated with 
Carnegie Mellon in 1983, Maly 
has been honored with various 
awards, including the Ministry 
of Higher Education of Poland 
Research Award and Carnegie 
Mellons Benjamin Richard Teare 
Teaching Award.
T.E. Schlesinger, head of the 
ECE department, expressed de
light in Malys achievement. 
Professor Maly is a remarkable 
presence, leader, and educator in 
the field of semiconductor design 
and manufacturing, Schlesinger 
said. His contributions to the 
advancement of semiconductor 
technology, and the influence he 
has had as a teacher and mentor 
to so many people in that com
munity, cannot be overstated.
His vision and his ideas are to
day part of the fabric of this field, 
and we are exceedingly proud 
of .the fact that the department 
of electrical and computer en
gineering at Carnegie Mellon is 
where he calls home. 
Maly is currently working 
alongside other researchers to in
vestigate trends in the integrated 
circuit industry. Malys past pub
lications on this subject have 
focused on the cost of producing
integrated circuits and on the 
processing methods of wafers, 
which are semiconducting ma
terials.
Maly is also working on a proj
ect called Y4 (Yield Forecaster), 
which aims to analyze the re
lationship between the design, 
testing, packaging, and failure 
analysis of semiconductors.
To study adjustments that are 
made in these processes, Maly 
and collaborators developed 
the software program Y4. The 
program simulates an actual 
production line in which users 
can change the attributes of a 
product and determine the timPhil Nigh, a 1990 ECE gradu

release, Professor Maly is a real 
visionary when it comes to semi
conductor testing, and all of us 
working in this industry are a 
reflection of his demanding and 
caring teaching style.
Maly is also a past recipi
ent of the Technical Excellence 
Award from the Semiconduc

Pampered students miss out on life lessons
College is the first place many people 
experience roommates, responsibility, 
and weight gain. Freedom abounds as 
students figure out how to make new 
friends all over again, how to live with 
someone, how to take care of their own 
laundry, bathe themselves regularly in a 
public bathroom, and ration a meal plan 
without wasting money or sacrificing, 
health.
Learning how to interact with people 
comes from living with them, dealing 
with being sexiled, and making deci
sions about who should vacuum the 
next time around. These things prepare
students for life after the college bubble 
bursts, when rent needs to be split and 
apartment-mates need to be kept happy.
Thats why, after reading The Wash
ington Posts article about.the increase 
of colleges (like American University) 
providing double-sized beds in dorm 
rooms, about more single rooms (be
cause its what young people are used 
to now), and about the occasionally 
provided extensive dorm-room maid 
service (because college kids dont think 
they should be held responsible for the 
cleanliness of their own living space), 
we think its time to say something to
our peers: Grow up.
Learning to get along with people and 
to live responsibly with little means is 
part of becoming an adult, and being 
catered to by campus housing services 
hampers the maturation process.
In short, deal with normal college life. 
In the long run, learning to cope with 
odd living situations prepares you for 
other oddities ahead, perhaps not unlike 
the loud and messy cubicle neighbor. 
Dont put it upon yourselves to deprive 
youth of dorm-room horror stories. It is 
a students responsibility to learn, not to 
be spoiled.
Florida students stunning deserves a second look
When University of Florida student 
Andrew Meyer refused to step down 
from the microphone at a John Kerry 
forum on Monday, Meyer was seized by 
university police, stunned with a Taser, 
and eventually arrested.
At first, most people thought the same 
thing: Blame the police. Meyer was 
trying to ask a questiona First Amend
ment right  and wound up stunned by 
a Taser gun and cuffed.
Outraged, students protested on the 
University of Florida campus, and colle
gians across the country formed dozens 
of Facebook groups voicing their opin
ions. Videos of the incident soared to the 
heights of YouTube popularity, which 
kept people talking.
Many jumped off the damn-the-man
bandwagon, though, once they learned 
a little more about Andrew Meyer.
A couple days after the incident, 
some new information suggested that 
the event was more of a stunt than an 
injustice.
For one thing, Meyer is known 
for videotaping his shenanigans  
according to some student testimonies
 like the time he carried around a 
Harry dies sign in public following the 
release of J.K. Rowlings latest book.
Moreover, a police officer told the 
Associated Press that Meyer handed 
his camera to a woman he didnt know 
and asked her to film him before he 
approached the microphone  almost 
as if he knew that there was soon to be a 
scene. Meyers police report stated that
he was laughing and lighthearted 
once he was no longer on camera.
In light of all of this, its easy to say 
that Andrew Meyer is a jerk who got 
what he deserved  and a lot of people 
have  but our opinion falls somewhere 
in the middle.
We agree that Meyer isnt the victim
ized young liberal many expected when 
his video first hit YouTube. He obviously 
did expect something to happen, but the 
fact remains that something did.
Footage of the incident makes one 
thing clear: Meyer was able to provoke 
the police into stunning him with a 
Taser gun in a matter of minutes, acting 
hardly more obnoxious than a Frat boy 
mid-keg. We just wish it hadnt been so 
easy.
Protesters and police reach free speech agreement
Huddled together with their hand
made signs (Honk for peace), a group 
of peaceful protesters have been staging 
an around-the-clock protest by the army 
recruiting station on Forbes Avenue in 
Oakland since Sept. 4. Protesters and 
members of the Pittsburgh Organizing 
Group (POG) intended to continue their 
End War Fast event  a hunger strike 
and protest demanding that American 
troops be immediately withdrawn from 
Iraq  in front of the recruiting station 
for the entirety of September.
Unfortunately, the month-long, 24- 
hour-a-day protest was interrupted 
several times by city of Pittsburgh Po
lice. Protester Michael Butler was cited 
by police three times for a non-traffic 
violation of obstructing highways and 
passages. City police also cited another
protester, and one woman was arrested, 
processed, and detained for hours by po
lice for lying on the sidewalk.
Last Tuesday, the ACLU of Pennsylva
nia filed suit against the city of Pittsburgh 
on behalf of POG and five protesters, 
claiming that city police officers were 
infringing upon their First Amendment 
rights to freedom of expression and po
litical speech. At a time when the Patriot 
Act has significantly restricted rights 
guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights, it 
was a wholly courageous and necessary 
act on the part of the ACLU, POG, and 
the protesters to defend their right to 
peaceful protest without threat of cita
tion or arrest.
On Wednesday, before both par
ties entered the federal court room 
for a hearing regarding a request for a
temporary restraining order, the two 
groups gathered together and reached 
an out-of-court agreement. Under the 
agreement, the city will provide two ar
eas on Forbes Avenue for an unlimited 
number of protesters to gather 24 hours 
a day until Sept. 30. The protesters will 
leave enough space for pedestrian traf
fic.
Patrick Young, one of the protest
ers cited by police, said of Wednesdays 
agreement with the city, We see today 
as an absolute victory on all counts. The 
Tartan also considers a day when a pro
test group and the city are able to have 
a peaceful discussion outside the court
room a victory  especially when that 
discussion leads to an agreement that 
promotes and protects our rights to free 
speech and political dissent.
Citys expensive security plan 
ignores real issues behind crime
Veronica Milliner
For the most part, I try to avoid tak
ing part in any criminal activity just like 
every other law-abiding, nose-to-thegrindstone, best-foot-forward Carnegie 
Mellon student. I also love Pittsburgh 
just like every Carnegie Mellon student, 
but Im starting to have some serious 
problems with the way the city deals 
with its public safety issues.
Last week, Pittsburgh City Council 
took the first step in approving Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahls security plan. The 
plan would install a system of security 
cameras throughout the city in addition 
to enacting several other public safety 
initiatives. The proposal would initially 
place two cameras on each of the bridg
es straddling the Monongahela and 
Allegheny rivers. City Council approved 
the use of $2.59 million in federal grants 
for the project.
To be honest, when I first read about 
Mayor Ravenstahls plan, the first thing 
that popped into my head wasnt Whoa, 
Pittsburghs gonna be a whole lot safer. 
Thanks, Mayor! What did pop into my 
head was, Whoa, this is going to do 
absolutely nothing. Thanks, Mayor. It 
seemed to me like a misguided use of 
funds that will take away the privacy of 
Pittsburghers. In return well receive... 
absolutely nothing.
Many cities have started to create 
surveillance systems to deal with crime. 
However, among all the studies that 
have been done, none show that that 
they resulted in a significant decrease 
in crime. One example is Tampa, Fla., 
which installed a facial recognition 
device in 2001 but removed it a few 
years later after it failed to lead to any 
arrests. No studies have shown that citywide surveillance systems do anything 
to prevent crime.
Plus, criminals will find a way around 
the system. Thats why theyre criminals. 
Criminal activity will just move away 
from the line of sight of the cameras, or 
suspects will find ways to shield their 
faces. And if theyre not smart enough to 
do that, then theyll probably be caught 
anyway, with or without cameras.
Still, after watching reports on KDKA, 
I was shocked to find many Pittsburghers 
see no problem with the citys plan. 
These people may not be fully aware 
of the entire security plan that the city 
has in store for us. Placing cameras on 
bridges is only the first step in an exten
sive surveillance program.
When announced back in June, the 
initial plan called for a $3.4 million initia
tive to place security cameras Downtown 
and throughout the city, adding around 
83 cameras to the approximately 150 
already in place. Additionally, the sur
veillance system would include license 
detection devices that can capture plate 
information and run it through a data
base. As much as I would love city offi
cials to see my L8RH8R custom license
plate, all this seems a little obtrusive.
City Information Systems Director 
Howard Stern has stated that the council 
plans to include a privacy policy clause 
in the legislation before the final vote 
to approve the plan on Tuesday, but the 
plan has yet to set any restrictions on 
who will have access to the information 
and how it will be stored and shared. 
Mayor Ravenstahl has also expressed 
the possibility of joint ownership of the 
system and the sharing of information 
with both public and private safety forc
es in the area.
While the existence of footage of me 
walking to campus or stuffing food in 
my face doesnt necessarily concern me,
I am worried about the effect that a city 
full of cameras will have on the psyche of 
those being filmed. Think of everything 
youve ever done outside of your own 
private home, all the establishments 
that youve ever entered. Would you like 
to have zero control over who views this 
footage? Would you enjoy the possibil
ity of it emerging again sometime in the 
future? While it may not be criminal 
behavior, everyone does some things 
that they dont want taken out of con
text and seen by everyone with access tot 
these security cameras.
Im fully aware that crime in the city is 
on the rise, and I appreciate that the city 
is taking steps to combat it. It just seems 
like filming the crimes that occur along 
with documenting the daily activities of 
law-abiding Pittsburghers is not a proac
tive way to decrease crime.
The citys goal is to target crime 
directly by placing cameras in neigh
borhoods where crime statistics show 
a lot of criminal activity. The intended 
neighborhoods for this plan have not yet 
been identified, which says very little 
about the effectiveness of this plan and 
more about the possibility that poorer 
neighborhoods or areas with a high per
centage of minorities may be unfairly 
monitored.
If police and the city already know 
where crime is happening, wouldnt it be 
more practical and cost-effective to put 
more police there instead of installing 
$3 million worth of surveillance camer
as? Perhaps instead police could work to 
find the deep-seated reason behind the 
crime  or create programs that would 
not only work toward crime reduction, 
but overall community development.
I dont know the way to prevent crime. 
Officials in urban areas have been try
ing to figure that out for a long time. 
However, installing cameras wont sud
denly make criminals have an epiphany 
and completely turn their lives around. 
There are more complex reasons that 
city officials will have to work with 
before crime can be reduced. The pro
cess may not be as easy as slapping a 
camera on the side of a building, but it 
definitely makes a lot more sense.

Use consumerism for good by bringing fair trade coffee to Pittsburgh
Jessica Thurston
Fair trade coffee partnerships 
are economic relationships that 
exist to help out small-scale 
producers and farmers, many 
of whom work under poor 
economic conditions in southern 
hemisphere countries. A goal 
of fair trade coffee is to pay a 
fair price to producers rather 
than just organizations, which 
may include paying small-scale 
farmers up to 60 percent of pre
harvest financing or offsetting 
expensive costs needed to acquire 
fair trade certification and to 
cover transportation of coffee 
beans and laborers. Pre-harvest 
financing  paying a proportion 
of the cost of coffee up front  is 
part of a pact between producers 
and consumers to keep produc
ers from acquiring debt, a major 
tenet of fair trade coffee.
Fair trade coffee partnerships 
are gaining ground in markets 
worldwide. Fair trade coffee is 
even gaining ground in our own 
Steel City, which is rumored to 
have the most coffee drinkers per
capita in the nation. (Although 
undocumented, my own observa
tions lead me to believe that 95 
percent of these coffee drinkers 
are Carnegie Mellon students, 75 
percent of whom are likely to be 
from the English department.) 
Still, a large percentage of con
sumers dont know about fair 
trade coffee, and, by default, 
arent supporting it.
John Soluri, an associate pro
fessor in the history department 
at Carnegie Mellon, explained 
the complexities that arise when 
attempts are made at making 
fair trade coffee pacts a reality. 
On one hand, information about 
supporting fair trade coffee is not 
readily available, even at shops 
where it is sold. Consumers are 
not made aware of their respon
sibility to hold up their end of the 
deal  to support small produc
ers and equitable trade world
wide.
Thus, I urge you to ask for fair 
trade coffee when you grab your 
next cup o joe  the vendor you 
go to might be able to brew it for 
you, or you could try to purchase 
a bag of fair trade coffee beans. 
Many local and independent
coffee shops, such as La Prima 
Espresso (whose home is in the 
Strip District), are working to 
spread the word about fair trade 
coffee, and every cup you buy 
supports these partnerships and 
helps support small-scale produc
ers.
If purchasing fair trade coffee 
can help sustain small producers, 
why isnt it more readily avail
able? Soluri elaborated on an 
unfortunate irony that exists in 
making fair trade coffee more 
accessible to Pittsburghers. As 
fair trade coffee is often more 
expensive than non-fair trade 
coffee, it is more likely to be sup
ported by latte, cappuccino, and 
macchiato enthusiasts  fancy
coffee drinkers. Essentially, more 
materialistic and pop-cultureific coffee drinkers who prefer 
the higher-end, more expensive 
coffee at a place like Starbucks 
would probably be the most likely 
candidates to shell out the extra 
money for the more expensive 
fair trade coffee. The irony lies 
in the fact that trendy, powerful 
venues like Starbucks not only
rarely support fair trade coffee, 
they even work in opposition to it 
by supporting middleman orga
nizations that do not properly 
compensate producers.
Why are stores that are likely 
financially able to support fair 
trade coffee, such as Starbucks, 
not backing it more strongly?
First of all, fair trade coffee is not 
as readily available as non-fair 
trade coffee in the United States 
due to the complex (and expen
sive) process of acquiring fair 
trade certification. But Starbucks, 
which recently upped its average 
prices by about 10 cents a bever
age, seems to already be making 
a huge profit on drinks. Iced cof
fee, for example, costs $2.03 at 
the Starbucks on the corner of 
Forbes and South Craig, but only 
$1.50 at Coffee Tree Roasters on 
Walnut in Shadyside  a venue 
where almost all coffees are fair 
trade.
Starbucks does sell one variety 
of fair trade coffee in bean form 
and will agree to brew you a cup 
if you ask for it. But as a consumerist superpower, this seem
ingly profit-hungry corporation 
should be doing more work to 
broadcast the importance of fair 
trade coffee. Starbucks, frighten
ingly, seems to have the power 
to tell consumers what they 
should be drinking, whether it 
is through saliva-inducing names 
(Pomegranate Frappuccino, 
anyone?) or enticing packaging 
(such as shiny, multi-colored cof
fee bean bags placed alluringly in 
window displays). Why not har
ness this cultural power for good 
by introducing consumers to fair 
trade coffee and making it a com
monly brewed product in stores?
I understand the argument 
that Starbucks might not be able 
to ensure the quality of drinks in 
franchise and corporate-owned 
stores due to potentially small 
quantities of available fair trade 
coffee. But if this is a question 
of quality versus morals, morals 
have to start winning in our soci
etys overly commodified popular 
culture.
Buying your coffee at shops like 
La Prima Espresso and Coffee Tree 
Roasters (instead of Starbucks) 
will help support fair trade cof
fee. Going green and sustain
able growth cannot remain just 
trendy terms; we have to empha
size equity and transparency in 
trade to remain responsible as 
consumers  and as people.

She welcomes all responses.
A large percentage of consumers 
dont know about fair trade coffee, 
and, by default, arent supporting it.
Hipsters bashing hipsters: using irony to veil fear of judgment
Cecilia Westbrook
So ironic its not; so unironic, it 
is. This was a line from a YouTube 
video that recently found its way 
into my inbox. In less than a day 
that video had been saved for me 
on del.icio. us twice, instant mes
saged to me, and referred to in 
casual conversation.
The video in question is called 
the Hipster Olympics. Set in 
Williamsburg, a neighborhood 
in Brooklyn known by the indie 
crowd as ground zero for hipsters, 
Olympics features a collection of 
emaciated, sun-fearing 20-somethings sporting solid-colored 
American Apparel clothes, tight 
pants, ironic T-shirts, and over
sized sunglasses. The hipsters 
are competing in events like the 
MySpace Photo Shoot and the 
Music Collection Bragathon.
The Hipster Olympics is part 
of a new genre of humor bashing 
the creature called the hipster. 
Hipsters like indie rock, wear 
American Apparel striped dresses 
with white belts, supertight jeans, 
oversized sunglasses, mid-calf 
length spandex leggings, and flat 
shoes. They read Pitchfork, smoke 
Camel or Parliament lights, and 
spend their free time taking 
glamor shots for their MySpace 
pages. The hipster value system is 
based around being judgmental 
of music and art, wholly con
cerned with name-dropping and 
being up on the very latest under
ground band that you havent 
heard of yet. And, perhaps above 
all, hipsters value irony.
Hipster-bashing humor has 
lately grown in popularity all 
over the Internet. TheOnion. 
com recently ran an article about 
Pitchfork giving music itself a
6.0 out of ten rating. YouTube 
is full of videos of hipsters try
ing to pretend that they arent 
hipsters. A Google search of the 
word hipster reveals the prev
alence of the stereotype; The 
Hipster Handbook has even been
popular and well known in mass 
media, or until the next unheardof sensation floats into view on 
Pitchfork's front page.
But the hipster self-bashing is 
where it has really gone too far. 
Hipsters are so hip they refuse 
even to be hipsters; its a term
that nobody embraces, and 
that nobody will admit to. The 
reason videos like the Hipster 
Olympics have such a high view 
count is that those of us who lis
ten to indie rock are perpetually 
afraid of being labeled hipsters 
ourselves. Like jealous girlfriends 
who point out the flaws of every 
woman around us, we jump on 
the opportunity to make fun of 
hipsters. We turn our noses up at 
their vapid narcissism and then 
go preen in front of our mirrors, 
fix our oversized sunglasses, 
and arrange the ash trays on our 
coffee tables for our next blackand-white photography projects. 
We laugh at the irony of the situa
tion, hiding our deep-seated fear 
of being judged by other people 
for being as vapid and narcissistic 
as we really are.
I think its time to cut the crap 
and own up to it. Its time we 
just stand up for things that we 
like. I listen to Andrew Bird and 
sometimes I spend hours put
ting on makeup just to take a 
Facebook picture. Mid-calf length 
lycra pants are a godsend to me, 
because I like to wear skirts but 
I also ride a bike. I like a whole 
genre of music and I like having 
opinions about it that I cant really 
back up with musical knowledge. 
But dang it, the music is good, 
my fashion sense works, and my 
pictures look all right.
The take-home point is that 
its okay to have opinions about 
things, and there is no point in 
worrying about being wrong. No 
opinions are right. No music is 
unequivocally good. Thats the 
way its supposed to be, too. Art 
is art because its subjective and 
people react to it in different 
ways. Its not necessary to rely 
on irony to validate your opin
ions, because theyre just your 
opinions. If youre going to be a 
hipster, be proud.

The major consumers of this 
kind of humor are the hipsters 
themselves, in the kind of ironic 
display that characterizes the 
hipster persona. This is the 
demographic that spawned the
ironic T-shirt and likes to dress 
in fashions that are deliberately 
unstylish or downright unflatter
ing.
Hipster irony is predicated 
on the fear that if you take a 
stand and claim to actually like 
something, you are opening
yourself up to criticism by those 
who do not. The work-around is 
to only like things ironically, to 
never actually come out in sup
port of anything. Even the music 
is in constant flux; hardcore

as long as the band fails to be

EVERY SEASON STARTS AT----am---------- *-------
Volleyball team improves to 7-7
VOLLEYBALL, from A12
and eventually tie the match at 
26 apiece. Unfortunately for the 
Tartans, this comeback was not
enough and Otterbein took the 
match 30-28.
The fourth match also provided 
a nail-biting contest. Neither 
team gave much ground as the 
score remained close for most of 
the match. However, the energy 
of the Tartans provided the spark 
they needed to ultimately come 
away with the match and the 
game, 30-24.
We pretty much had our 
energy, first-year defensive spe
cialist Cameron Griffin said. We 
picked it up. Our passing was 
good, our setting was good, and 
out hitters put it away.
Immediately following the first 
match, Carnegie Mellon went on 
to face Capital College. It was 
obvious from the start of the 
match that the Tartans were still 
exhausted from their previous 
competition.
I think we were just tired, 
sophomore setter Samantha 
Carter said. We still gave it a lot 
of heart, but just being tired was
probably why we played a little 
worse.
The fatigue was evident in the 
scoring as Capital swept the Tar
tans in three straight matches 
with scores of 30-21, 30-18, 
30-23.
The Tartans did not let the loss 
get them down, however, as they 
were eager to face the next day of 
competition.
Carter mentioned that the 
team would regroup easily after 
the loss with a simple solution. 
Lots of rest and thinking about 
not making mistakes, she said.
Day two of the Crossover tour
nament started on a high note for 
Carnegie Mellon, as it defeated 
John Carroll University 3-2. The 
Tartans were able to defeat John 
Carroll with scores of 36-34, 
30-19, 27-30,17-30,15-12.
The second game of the day 
for the Tartans saw them play 
familiar rival Muskingum Col
lege, whom Carnegie Mellon 
had already faced this season. In 
their previous game with Musk
ingum, the Tartans had suffered 
defeat 3-1. The Tartans had not 
forgotten about that loss.
Muskingum weve faced 
before, Carter said. So were go
ing to try to think of what we can 
do from last time.
Carnegie Mellon appeared to 
have put that loss behind them 
as they were able to sweep Musk
ingum College in three straight 
matches with scores of 30-14, 
30-28, 30-27.
The win brought Carnegie 
Mellons record to .500 on the 
year at 7-7. The Tartans have 
now won six of their last seven 
competitions and do not have 
any intentions of slowing down. 
They continue competition this 
weekend at the University Ath
letic Association round robin 
tournament in New York.

MENS, from A12
Bazin turned away the penalty 
kick from Altoonas Bryan Pierzga to preserve the shutout  at 
least temporarily; the ball was 
cleared over the end-line by the 
Tartans. On the ensuing corner 
kick, the Lions netted the equal
izer as Pierzgas header sent the 
ball sailing into the near side of 
the goal.
I could see a fire lit in our team 
after they tied the game, senior 
defender Christopher Watts said. 
Instead of us getting down, I 
could tell everyone wanted it 
more because we got a little lazy 
after our first goal [and] let them 
get back in the game. Everyone 
stepped up their play in order to 
get this win.
I think this win means a lot 
for this team, Watts said. Were 
a young team and were starting 
new. Its nice for them to get over 
the hurdle before they even know 
what the hurdle is. They dont 
have to go into this game think
ing that this is going to stop our 
season like it stopped our season 
the past couple years. Its a very 
big win for this young team this 
early in the season.
It gives us confidence to know 
you can still beat a team even if 
youre a little bit behind, Lutz 
said.
On Saturday against Mount 
Union, Browne netted the first 
goal of the game in the 30th 
minute when he laced a free kick 
from 24 yards out nicely into 
the top right corner of the goal.
Griffin and Browne converted a 
give-and-go leading up to Browne 
getting fouled.
Sophomore midfielder Jona
than Hall cushioned the lead for 
the Tartans with a header into 
the goal in the 88th minute. Hall 
deflected a header by junior mid
fielder A1 Penksa.
Just 46 seconds later, Griffin 
put his fifth goal of the season 
away as he slipped a shot past 
Mount Union goalkeeper Matt 
Mazzolini after sophomore for
ward Keith Haselhoff beat a 
defender and put a shot off the 
post.
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
soccer team will be in action 
again tomorrow when they host 
the Grove City Wolverines. The 
game is at 7:30 p.m.

Corvino passed a ball to soph

middle of the 18-yard box for 
Stever to head into the far side

Carnegie Mellon out-shot

keeper Anya Rosen made one.
Carnegie Mellon came in 
to Saturdays game energized 
and ready to take on seventhranked Denison. Just before the
conclusion of the first half, Rose 
struck a corner into the 6-yard 
box, which DeWath finished into 
the near post in the 44th minute, 
tallying her second career goal 
and first of the 2007 season.
Big Red forward Sarah Ash 
hit a shot from just outside 
the 18-yard box, which Rosen 
tipped out over the crossbar in 
the 67th minute. Four minutes 
later, Rosen dove to her left to 
punch a shot by Big Red firstyear midfielder Eliza Miller out 
of bounds.
Rosen believes the team fi
nally played up to their potential 
in the match against Denison. 
We controlled the center of the 
field, had good clears, and didnt
kick the ball over the top, she 
said. It has been intimidating 
being a freshman, but the girls 
are amazing and I love playing 
with them.
Rosen preserved the teams 
shutout and made three integral 
saves. Denison senior goalkeeper 
Liz Gillette made four saves.
It was a natural instinc
tive play, Rosen said about her 
saves. Afterwards, I was so ex
cited about what just happened 
that it brought my level of inten
sity up. They cant get past me 
now. They tried and couldnt do 
it, so we had to win.

host Washington & Jefferson

THE TARTAN  SEPTEMBER 24, 2007Ail
Familar quarterbacks impact on new teams
Sam Kim
The National Football League 
season is underway with lots of 
exciting rookies and star play
ers playing top-notch football. 
We all know and idolize star 
quarterbacks such as Peyton 
Manning, Carson Palmer, or 
Tom Brady, but what about the 
QBs we never talk about? What 
.about the familiar veteran QBs 
and their impact on their new 
teams? As someone who closely 
monitors football, I am here 
to offer my top three familiar
successful with deep passes to 
Joey Galloway. For someone in 
his late 30s, Garcia continues to 
be very mobile.
Garcia should prove to be a 
valuable addition to a young 
Buccaneers team, providing 
playoff experience and leader
ship skills. The success of the 
Buccaneers will depend on 
whether Garcia stays healthy 
despite his age and whether his 
mediocre arm strength will be 
enough to throw deep passes to 
Galloway.
Who wouldve thought that 
the Houston Texans would be
There always seems to be at least 
one surpise QB who leads his team 
to the playoffs.
QBs who will impact their new 
teams in a big way.
Jeff Garcia, last years hero of 
the Philadelphia Eagles, leads 
a Tampa Buccaneers team that 
disappointed many fans last 
year. Garcia, once a Pro Bowl 
quarterback for the San Fran
cisco 49ers, struggled the past 
few years before accepting the 
backup QB role with the Eagles 
last season.
After Donovan McNabb
went down with a serious in
jury for the Eagles mid-season, 
Garcia embraced the familiar 
West Coast offense and led the 
team to a surprising playoff 
appearance.
This season, Garcia should 
perform well under Jon 
Grudens West Coast offense. 
This season so far, Garcia has 
had an impressive 31-14 victory 
over New Orleans, but also suf
fered a disappointing 6-20 loss. 
In his first two games, he has 
thrown over 400 yards in pass
ing and has accumulated a QB 
rating well over 100.
Garcia has been relying on a 
lot of short throws to his run
ning back and wideouts, but 
more importantly, he has been
2-0 this early in the season? 
Thanks to the acquisition of 
veteran QB Matt Schaub from a 
trade with the Atlanta Falcons, 
the Texans are off to a very 
strong start.
The Texans beat two tough 
teams, the Kansas City Chiefs 
and the Carolina Panthers, 
rather convincingly. A for
mer third-round pick in 2004, 
Schaub had limited but very 
successful stints as the backup 
QB behind Michael Vick.
In the first two games, Schaub 
has had well over 400 yards in 
passing and a 72.0 completion 
rating that ranks third in the 
league.
Schaub has the potential to be 
a star QB in the league, but his 
stardom will largely depend on 
an unproven and shaky offense. 
However, with veteran running 
back Ahman Green and elite 
wide receiver Andre Johnson, 
Schaub should have enough 
weapons to be competitive in 
the league.
Schaub has a lot to play for 
this season because this is his 
first real attempt at the start
ing QB position. All four QBs 
taken in front of him in 2004
(Eli Manning, Phillip Rivers, 
Ben Roethlisberger, and J.P. 
Losman) are well-known start
ing QBs.
The Miami Dolphins are off 
to an 0-2 start, but there are 
reasons to be hopeful about 
their new QB Trent Green. In his 
debut, Green lost a very close 
overtime game to the Redskins 
but established a good relation
ship with wide receiver Chris 
Chambers, who caught six 
passes for 92 yards.
Green had a lackluster sec
ond game against the Dallas 
Cowboys, with two fumbles and 
four interceptions. Although 
many observers view Green as 
a temporary placeholder until 
future QB John Beck is ready, 
Green brings a lot of success 
and leadership into an unstable 
organization. Last season, the 
Dolphins head coach, Nick Saban, bolted to Alabama while 
the Daunte Culpepper experi
ment failed.
In his glory days with Kansas 
City, Green topped 4000 pass
ing yards and led one of the 
most vaunted offenses in the 
league. Despite his early strug
gles, Green has still managed to 
throw for more than 500 yards 
in the first two games. Also, 
Green has worked previously 
with head coach Cam Cameron, 
who used to be his quarterback 
coach.
After ending his career with 
the Chiefs in an awful loss 
against the Colts last season, 
Green has plenty to prove this 
season. If Garcia and other vet
eran QBs can revive their career, 
Green certainly can do it too. If 
the running game for the Dol
phins improves, Green has the 
ability to be a reasonably good 
quarterback.
There always seems to be at 
least one surprise QB who leads 
his team to the playoffs. At 
least one of the three quarter
backs mentioned above (Garcia, 
Schaub, Green) will have a Pro 
Bowl season and advance his 
team to the playoffs. These are 
veteran quarterbacks trying to 
prove that they still have what it 
takes to be idolized.
Football team suffers second defeat
Zhiquan Yeo/Photo Staff
Senior running back Colby Witman (#2) sprints down the field through Allegheny defenders.
FOOTBALL, from A12
Marks extra point tied the game 
at 14 heading into halftime.
Carnegie Mellons first posses
sion of the second half abruptly 
ended when Alleghenys Nick 
Jones intercepted Facemyer. 
Jones returned the ball 39 yards 
to the Tartans 21-yard line. With 
great field position, Allegheny 
took the lead when Salopek 
threw a 5-yard touchdown pass 
to receiver Jake Vite.
Carnegie Mellon moved the 
ball into Allegheny territory 
multiple times in the second 
half, but was unable to score due 
to turnovers. Facemyer fumbled 
on two separate occasions when 
Carnegie Mellon had the ball at 
Alleghenys 31-yard line.
Another Facemyer fumble, 
recovered by Allegheny at Car
negie Mellons 17-yardt line late 
in the third quarter, set the stage 
for Alleghenys final points of 
the evening. Credit the Tartan 
defense, as Allegheny only man
aged 3 yards on three plays, but
a 31-yard field goal attempt by 
Josh Whiteside was on target, 
putting the Gators up 24-14.
Down by 10 with four minutes 
left in the game, Carnegie Mel
lons offense buckled down and 
executed. A 2-yard touchdown 
pass from Facemyer to senior 
running back Robert Gimson 
capped off a 14-play, 80-yard 
drive that lasted just over three 
minutes.
Down 24-21 with only 1:02 
remaining, Carnegie Mellon re
sorted to an onside kick. Marks 
kick was solid, but Jones fielded 
it nicely to seal the Gator victory.
Our coaches tell us never to 
give up, Scholl said. You dont 
look at the scoreboard and say 
Were down by 10 with two min
utes to go; we quit. No, thats 
not how we work. Were going to 
fight until the end.
Offense, defense, special 
teams, we have to do better in 
every aspect of the game, Sivek 
said. Allegheny came out and 
they played real tough; we just 
need to be more aggressive, get
our assignments, and execute.
The defense played well in 
the second half [and] made some 
plays, unfortunately we came up 
short, Scholl said. As it ended 
up, we had the onside kick  we 
had a chance to get the ball back 
and score, but unfortunately we 
didnt.
Facemyer finished with a 
career-high 153 yards passing 
as Carnegie Mellon out-gained 
Allegheny 407-305 in total of
fense. Howe set career highs 
with seven receptions for 96 
yards and a touchdown. Scholl 
led the Tartan defense with 13 
tackles from his safety spot.
This off week is going to help 
us get our injuries taken care of, 
Sivek said. We need to come 
back fighting. Were not a group 
of guys whos going to fold under 
pressure like this. Were going 
to come back and have a' good 
year.
The Tartans will next be in ac
tion Saturday, Oct. 6, at 1 p.m. 
when they head to RandolphMacon College in Virginia.

Men's cross country runs 
at St. Vincent Invitational
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
Last Saturday, part of the mens 
cross country team competed at 
the St. Vincent Invitational in 
Latrobe, Pa.
Although only a few runners 
participated, the mens team had 
an impressive day in the 5-mile 
race, finishing third among 13 
teams with 63 points.
Adam Smith and Wayne 
Hooper from St. Vincent College 
took first and second overall, 
respectively, to help lead the 
Bearcats to a first-place team 
finish with 35 points. California 
University of Pennsylvania took 
the second-place team trophy 
with 60 points.
For Carnegie Mellon, first-year 
Erik Kallenbach had a strong 
race by finishing first for the 
Tartans and sixth overall with 
a time of 28:04. Behind Kallen
bach, junior Raphael Bertrand 
took ninth overall with a time of 
28:21.
Finishing 10th overall, firstyear Jonathan Matusky also 
had a solid performance with a 
time of 28:37. Senior Jason Jura
placed 11th overall with a time 
of 28:41. Im very disappointed 
with how I ran today, Jura said. 
Im running two minutes slower 
than I did last year.
Junior Taka Matsuura finished 
29th overall with a time of29:43, 
while sophomore Tim Baumgarten took 44th overall with a time 
of 30:34.
Considering that the squad 
who took third at St. Vincent was 
a third of our strength, we really 
showed our depth and high level 
of commitment from everyone 
on the roster, Matsuura said.
It was mostly younger guys 
running, and it looks like they 
are taking some good steps to
wards the next few years, Jura 
said. Everyone on the team has 
high expectations. Obviously 
we would like to finish higher 
than we placed last year, 12th at 
nationals.
This Friday, the top male 
runners and the womens team 
will travel to Bethlehem, Pa. 
to compete at the Paul Short 
Invitational, hosted by Lehigh 
University.
Lehigh will also host the NCAA 
regional cross-country meet in 
November.

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
volleyball team played host this 
past weekend to seven other 
teams as they engaged in the 
Carnegie Mellon Crossover tour
nament. Teams from Eastern 
College, Muskingum College, 
John Carroll University, Capital 
College, Geneva College, and 
Otterbein College participated 
in the annual event. Carnegie 
Mellon fared well in the tourna
ment, finishing with three wins 
in four games over the two-day 
competition.
On the first day of competition, 
the Tartans faced off against Otterbein College. Carnegie Mellon 
appeared to pull away, taking as 
much as a seven-point lead in the 
match. Otterbein fought back to
bring the match within two but 
could not take the lead, falling 
30-26.
The Tartans continued to 
strike quickly and early in the 
second match of the game, tak
ing a six-point lead against 
Otterbein. Once again, however, 
the Tartans struggled to close out 
the match. Otterbein was able to 
close the gap and even take the 
lead. Despite these struggles, the 
Tartans fought back and went on 
to take the match 31-29.
As the first two matches of 
the game indicate, this compe
tition would be close all of the 
way through. In the third game 
with Carnegie Mellon looking 
for the sweep, Otterbein jumped 
out to lead the Tartans by seven 
early on. Carnegie Mellon was 
able to chip away at the lead

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team hosted the Penn 
State Behrend Lions last Monday 
and the Denison University Big 
Red Saturday. With two goals 
each, senior forward Kasey 
Stever and senior midfielder 
Amanda Rose contributed to 
the 4-0 win over the Lions, and 
junior defender Sarah DeWath 
scored her first goal of the sea
son to defeat Big Red 1-0. The 
Tartans advanced to a 4-3 re
cord for the season.
From the beginning whistle, 
Carnegie Mellon scrambled 
around Behrends defense. Ste
ver opened up the goal scoring 
in the 17th minute, when she 
received a throw-in from senior
Jessica Howard, which she stuck 
from the right side of the 6-yard 
box past Lions goalkeeper Kayla 
Frost and grazed the near post, 
tallying the games first goal.
First-year midfielder Valerie 
Corvino was tackled down in 
the 18-yard box in front of the 
goal, giving the Tartans a pen
alty kick and another scoring 
opportunity. Rose set up the kick 
and cranked a shot into the top 
left corner of the goal, with Frost 
unable to get a hand on it. Car
negie Mellon closed out the half 
up by two.
Teamwork between Rose and 
junior forward Abby Coffin made 
the third goal of the match possi
ble in the 55th minute. Rose ran 
onto a ball from Coffin and rifled 
a shot from 20 yards out to the

The mens soccer team main
tained their spotless record with 
two victories this past week. The 
win moves their record to a per
fect 5-0 as they approach their 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) games.
The Tartans defeated Penn 
State Altoona 2-1 at home 
Wednesday thanks to a late goal 
from sophomore forward Patrick
Lutz. On Saturday, the team 
blanked Mount Union 3-0 in 
Gesling Stadium.
On Wednesday, Lutz scored 
the game-winning goal in the 
88th minute with the score dead
locked at one after Altoona tied 
the game nine minutes earlier. 
Carnegie Mellon first-year mid
fielder Adam Bogus passed the 
ball into the box and Lutz, from 
behind the Lions defender, onetimed a shot that found the back 
of the net for his third goal of the 
season.
' Bogus played the ball, Lutz 
said. I guess there was some 
confusion between what the 
goalie and the defender were 
going to do and they hesitated. 
I just tried to kick it around him, 
get my foot around the defender 
and it just went into the back of 
the net. I saw a glimpse of it and 
got a foot on it.
Earlier in the game the Tartans 
opened the scoring when sopho
more midfielder Ryan Browne 
sent a through ball from the 
middle of the field to sophomore
forward Ricky Griffin streaking 
down the right side. Griffin laced 
a low shot past Lions goalkeeper 
Brandon McQuillen just inside 
the far post to give the Tartans the 
advantage in the 12th minute.
In an action-packed 79th min
ute with the Tartans clinging to 
a 1-0 lead, Penn State Altoona 
was awarded a penalty kick after 
a hand ball by Carnegie Mel
lon in the penalty box. Tartan

its first lead of the game. Start
ing with the ball on their own
II-yard line, after senior punter 
Matt Adams set a school record 
with a 70-yard punt, the Gators 
marched down the field in six 
plays. Senior quarterback T.J. 
Salopek connected with senior 
wide receiver James Jones in the 
end zone from 20 yards away.
Their quarterback, hes a great 
athlete, senior safety Jonathan 
Scholl said. You had to key in on 
the run threat as well as the pass 
threat. You need to cover both; 
its tough.
Carnegie Mellon answered 
with a touchdown drive, suc
cessfully managing the clock as 
halftime approached. Carnegie 
Mellon went 77 yards on 10 plays 
and scored a touchdown with 
only 10 seconds remaining in the 
first half.

After losing a heartbreaker 
to Hobart two weeks ago, the 
Carnegie Mellon football team 
returned home to the confines of 
Gesling Stadium, where they had 
not lost since Nov. 12, ,2005, to 
take on the Allegheny Gators last 
Saturday.
The Tartans out-gained the 
Gators in offense, but five Car
negie Mellon turnovers in the 
second half turned a 14-14 tie at 
halftime into a 24-14 Allegheny 
lead late in the game. The Tar
tans fought back in the closing 
minutes but fell at the hands of 
the Gators, losing 24-21.
You cant usually win with 
five turnovers and thats our 
fault as an offense, senior full
back Travis Sivek said. We have 
to do better than that to help our 
defense out.
Carnegie Mellon (2-2) had the 
offense in gear early, taking the 
opening kickoff 80 yards to pay 
dirt, with Sivek running the ball 
in from 1 yard out.
Allegheny (2-1) started its first 
drive with great field position 
after a long kickoff return of 46 
yards. The Gators tied the game

T-shirt transformation
Craft Night at Joseph-Beth Booksellers
Everything you need to know
About penguin love and Capicolla roommates
Joseph-Beth Booksellers at SouthSide Works 
hosts a monthly Craft Night, where an employee 
opens up an arts and crafts book and showcases 
a few of its ideas. Employee Kate Sears has 
been leading the workshop for a year now, and
 being a major crafter herself  she enjoys 
sharing craft ideas with beginners.
Our past projects have been fun activities like 
paper twirling, beading, and henna designing," 
Sears said. "[Henna designing] gained so much 
popularity that we had to repeat the class a 
second time." Next month, Sears is teaching 
pumpkin'carving, just in time for Halloween.
The book this week was Generation T: 108 Ways 
to Transform a T-Shirt by Megan Nicolay. The 
innovative book shows you how to convert a 
T-shirt into just about anything  tank tops, 
skirts, accessories, rugs, and even a wedding 
dress. The projects can all be done at home 
and require only simple hand sewing. The book 
displays a variety of methods to make funky 
T-shirts: by slashing them, by cutting off the 
sleeves in different ways, or by cutting two 
different T-shirts and sewing them together.
It also shows how to use T-shirts to make fun 
accessories like hats and hair clips.
While instructing the class, Sears was wearing a 
T-shirt she made by following the book. She saidshe wanted everyone to know that all of them . 
were definitely wearable and looked great. One of 
Searss examples was a colorful coiled rug made 
using T-shirt strips. The method is simple: braid 
the strips, coil the braid, and stick it in place.
The final product is an eye-catching floor rug, 
ideal for foyers or bathrooms. Demonstrating an 
easier project, Sears converted one of the sample 
T-shirts into'a new tank top by snipping off the 
sleeves at an angle.
With the do-it-yourself movement going strong, 
craft workshops are still popular local attractions. 
I have a group of regulars that come every 
month, Sears said, but there are still some new 
people who show up every time. The crowd 
mostly consists of middle-age women, almost 
all of them coming in groups. Many of them are 
serious crafters, while a few just come to learn 
something new. "My customers feel that they get 
something more productive from the event than 
they would at a night at the movies, Sears said.

Dear Myrtle,
I am extremely attracted 
to penguins. They are such 
beautiful little things that I 
cannot help but be mesmerized 
by their beauty. Do you think 
this is weird? Will society ever 
accept my love and stop being 
so stuck up? Why cant we just 
love and adore other species 
that are different from us? Also, 
since I am new to this area 
could you let me know where I 
can meet penguins around here 
(maybe even the one)?
Sad Penguin Lover
Hi there, SPL,
Love of penguins, or 
sphenisciformiphilia, is actually more 
common than you think, especially 
among middle-school girls and 
lonely Arctic nerds. How many 
penguin shirts, mugs, plush dolls, 
toothbrush holders, etc. do you see 
in every cutesy store in America? As 
long as you love a cute animal, youre 
good  if you felt something special 
for paramecia or those horned toads 
that squirt blood out of their eyes, 
then we might have a problem. Now, 
if were moving beyond penguin 
love to penguin sex, we might have 
a problem  because unless you 
speak fluent Penguish, how can you 
be sure they really want to get it on 
with you? As long as you promise 
to be platonic, youre in luck. The 
National Aviary (on the North Side) 
has a program called Penguin 
Connection which offers a "unique 
face-to-beak encounter. Just keep 
your pants on, SPL, make some 
feathered friends, and find yourself 
a good-natured human wholl be 
okay with wearing a penguin outfit 
and squawking a lot.
Myrtle
Dear Myrtle,
I have a little problem... well... 
a BIG problem. Its large, hairy, 
and it smells a little bit like 
Capicolla ham that was left on 
top of a heater for a few hours. If 
you havent already guessed, Im 
talking about my roommate.
I think that Ive seen him go to 
take a shower three or four times 
since we got to the dorm, which 
results in a bad enough smell.
As if the smell issue was not 
enough, he never seems to 
leave. Every time I walk into the 
room hes either on the phone, 
in bed, or in bed and on the 
phone. Then, when its finally a 
reasonable time to be in bed, he 
never is. He makes me feel like 
a jerk for wanting him to turn off 
the lights at two in the morning 
on a Monday.
I cant fit every minute detail in 
to this letter, but I will end with 
his obsessive desire to play and 
replay I Believe I Can Fly by R. 
Kelley on his computer. What 
should I do?
Sleepless at CMU
Listen up SAC,
Youre in luck. You dont live in the 
real , world yet, you live in a dorm. 
That means that if youre too much 
of a weenie to actually talk to your 
roommate about any of the things 
that make him the Antichrist in your 
eyes, you can talk to your RA about 
it. Its handy to have a disinterested 
third party around during those 
kinds of discussions to make sure 
you don't kill each other. Try talking 
to him, though  you have as much 
right to a non-crap existence as he 
does.

Bruce Naumans neon creations Save yourself 500 pages with a summary of Crime and Punishment
The current exhibit at The Warhol Museum, Elusive Signs: 
Bruce Nauman Works with Light, is a great example of 
abrasive art from the 70s. The exhibit features the art of 
Bruce Nauman, whose work includes sculpture, video, 
printmaking, performance, and installations.
Nauman concentrates on the artistic process and output 
rather than on mastering particular styles or techniques.
He is known for his frustration with conventional media; he 
once said, It seems to me that painting is not going to get 
us anywhere, and most sculpture is not going to either, and 
art has to go somewhere." For Nauman, that somewhere was 
neon.
We usually see neon signs as advertisements, but Nauman 
saw neon lights as a perfect medium to discuss sexual 
politics and semiotic linguistics. Neon light defies any kind 
of frame  it spills across the floor and over the walls, and it 
blinks relentlessly to get Naumans message across. One of 
his pieces, featuring a group of soldiers marching, shows the 
soldiers penises become erect and then deflate as they walk. 
Naumans work is at once crude and comical.
Warhol gallery attendant Keith Devreis had a particularly 
moving experience with Naumans art. "This work is 
psychedelically sublime, as it builds to a climax and 
practically screams at you," he said. "Its an exemplary 
extension of Warhols work with fluorescent paint."
Like Andy Warhol, Nauman is drawn to consumerism. He 
attacks societal norms and consumerism through neon, a 
medium that itself promotes these ideals. Illustrating this, the 
text from one neon work in the exhibit proclaims: The true 
artist helps the world by revealing mystic truths.
Molly McCurdy | Staffwriter
Elusive Signs opened this Saturday and runs through Dec. 30 
at The Andy Warhol Museum, bee with student ID.

Nauman's work featuring naked marching soldiers 
offers a crude, satirical look at sexuality.
The crime in Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment title 
takes only one of the novels six parts (seven, if you count the 
epilogue). Raskolnikov, a former student in increasingly poor 
health and debt, goes to a pawnbroker to try to sell his last 
remaining items. The old woman sneers at his belongings 
and offers less than expected, but Raskolnikov still takes 
the money. Back in school, he learned of the extraordinary 
man theory, that human beings of a superior intellect are 
able to bend the rules of morality to create their own laws. 
Raskolnikov, convinced of his intelligence, and arrogant even 
in poverty, believes himself to be one of these select few. He 
wonders if he can kill, and picks the old woman as his target.
Raskolnikov uses some of his little money to get a drink, 
and meets Marmeladov, an alcoholic who wastes his money 
on alcohol when he needs to support his daughter, second 
wife, and her two small children. His daughter, Sonya, 
became a prostitute to support her family. The next morning,
The murder is slowly tearing 
comes from a Russian word
Raskolnikov opens a letter from his mother, who will soon visit 
with his sister. Money is in the letter, and he feels guilty that 
he cannot support them.
Still determined, he carves a fake wooden necklace, hoping 
the pawnbroker will mistake it for something of value and 
that he can kill her while she is distracted. He returns to the 
pawnbrokers home and kills her with an ax. As he looks over 
his crime, the pawnbrokers sister returns, horrified. Frenzied, 
he kills her too.
The next morning Raskolnikov feels sick. He is called into the 
police office because he is behind on his rent, and an officer 
strikes up a conversation about the gruesome double murder. 
Raskolnikov faints. Soon, Razumikhin, his best friend from 
school, takes care of him as the police begin to notice that 
Raskolnikov cannot bear mention of the murders. He leaves, 
only to watch Marmeladov, the drunkard, get hit by an ox 
cart. Marmeladov dies, and Raskolnikov gives the widow 
and her children the money his mother had just sent him. 
Leaving, he returns to his apartment to find his mother and 
sister. Razumikhin introduces himself to the family only to fall 
for Dunya, Raskolnikovs sister. He makes no mention of it to 
her, however. Sonya, Marmeladov's daughter, visits at that 
moment and asks Raskolnikov to attend the funeral.
Next, Raskolnikov goes to the police station to see if he is 
suspected of murder. Porfiry Petrovich, a detective, does 
suspect Raskolnikov, but holds off on his questions as another 
man confesses to the crime. Raskolnikov returns to his 
apartment to sleep, and wakes up to find Svidrigailov, Dunya's 
former employer, watching him. Svidrigailov had tried to 
sleep with Dunya, but stopped when his employee told his 
wife. When his wife died, she left some money to Dunya. 
Svidrigailov mentions speaking to his dead wife about Dunya. 
Raskolnikov realizes Svidrigailov is insane and, disconcerted, 
ushers him out.
He goes to meet her suitor, but deems the man too proud 
and unacceptable as a husband for Dunya. Dunya and her 
mother beg for her to be married. Raskolnikov still refuses, and 
the fianc reveals himself to be just as rude as Raskolnikov 
suspected. Dunya throws him out, and Raskolnikov abruptly 
leaves. The murder is slowly tearing him apart  his 
name even comes from a Russian word meaning "schism. 
Razumikhin follows him, and without a word between them 
realizes Raskolnikov is the murderer.
Raskolnikov goes to Sonya's, where she reads him the story 
of Lazarus, a man resurrected by Jesus. Raskolnikov wishes 
to be resurrected, to feel clean instead of empty. He learns the 
pawnbroker's sister was Sonyas friend.
Raskolnikov confesses to Sonya, and she tries to make him go 
the police. Suddenly, they are alerted that the widow has lost 
her mind. Insane with grief, she dances in the streets with her

meaning schism.
two children-, begging for money. Finally, she falls down and 
dies. Svidrigailov appears and offers to pay for both the funeral 
and the schooling of the children. He. also tells Raskolnikov he 
knows he is the murderer.
Raskolnikov wanders around, running into Porfiry Petrovich 
again. The detective urges him to confess to the murders, 
knowing he must have committed them but lacking the evidence.
Svidrigailov follows Dunya to the room where she is staying, 
trying to seduce her, but she grabs away his gun and tries to 
kill him. Upset because she does not love him, he returns to 
the boarding house where he stays, sleeps, and shoots himself 
the next morning.
Raskolnikov goes to Sonya for support. She gives him one of her 
crosses, and he reluctantly enters the police station to confess.
In the epilogue, Raskolnikov is serving eight years for the two 
murders, because the courts realized he was not completely 
sane. He lives in Siberia, and Sonya moves nearby to see him 
and become a seamstress. He avoids her, still believing he is 
an extraordinary man. In the spring, she visits one day and 
sits in the grass. He weeps at her feet, wrapping his hands 
in her skirt, and begins to feel again, seeking forgiveness. He 
begins the path to redemption.
If you decide to read this on your own, find the Richard Pevear 
and Larissa Volokhonsky translation. More modernized, 
the husband and wife team manages to include all of 
Dostoyevskys original text, unlike Constance Garnetts 
translation in the public domain; Garnett excised whole 
passages she did not want to translate, thereby changing the 
tone of the novel and making the plot less .clear.

The story of the worlds most popular typefaceESSI rPaPerhouseOn songs about food
When Helvetica was first designed 
50 years ago, only designers and 
typesetters knew anything about 
typefaces. Today, we use them 
all the time, choosing to put an 
essay in Times New Roman (God 
forbid), Arial, or maybe Georgia. 
We pick fonts for websites, posters, 
and e-mails  most of us without 
thinking about it too much. (To 
clarify: "Helvetica is a typeface; 
Helvetica 12 bold is a font.) Very 
few of us have ever wondered where 
Helvetica came from. That is, except 
Gary Hustwit; his documentary 
Helvetica premiered this year
in honor of the typefaces 50th 
birthday, and it played in Pittsburgh 
last weekend.
Designer Max Miedinger developed 
Helvetica in Switzerland, when sans 
serif typefaces (without little feet 
on the bottoms of the letters) were 
regaining popularity. Miedinger
originally named his typeface
Neue Haas Grotesk, but luckily 
the German company in charge of 
marketing changed the name to 
Helvetica after the Latin name for 
Switzerland, Helvetia. Helvetica is 
a clean, modem, regular typeface, 
stripped  of the flourishes and 
finials that characterize typefaces 
trying to imitate hand lettering. It 
appeals to designers looking for a 
font that doesnt distract the reader, 
including American Apparel, 
Target, Greyhound, New Yorks 
subway system, Apple (the iPhone 
interface uses only Helvetica) and 
the Canadian government. Today, 
Helvetica is arguably the worlds 
most popular typeface.
Hustwit's documentary features 
interviews from designers who use 
typefaces like Helvetica in their 
daily work and a few who design 
typefaces themselves. Some of 
those interviewed hate Helvetica, 
declaring it soulless and overused; 
others love it, proclaiming it ideal 
for anything from street signs 
to corporate logos. The film also 
explores examples of Helvetica 
in everyday life, from fliers to

moments to keep viewers interested; 
a designer sets an article he found 
poorly written in unreadable Zapf 
Dingbats; another creates an 
advertisement by scratching bloody 
letters into his bare chest and 
photographing them. Its impossible 
to leave the film without finding 
Helvetica everywhere  on a Forbes 
Avenue street sign, on the side of a 
bus, or on the cover of a textbook.
Why make a movie about a typeface, 
anyway? Although most of us use 
them often, few people realize that 
someone drew each letter by hand, 
explained designer and associate 
English professor Suguru Ishizaki. 
"This movie can help people 
appreciate that typefaces come from 
human designers.
Every word you read or type is based 
on shapes someone drew by hand or 
on a computer. Nowadays anyone 
can be a type designer, thanks to 
the availability of software, but that 
doesnt mean their typefaces are any 
good.
Helvetica ends with the somewhat 
melancholy message that for type 
designers there is little new ground to 
cover, left in the world of type design. 
Ishizaki disagrees. People designed 
particular fonts for computer and cell 
phone screens, he said. We dont 
know what kind of surface type might 
be put on in the future. Moving type 
presents a blank canvas too; maybe 
a particular typeface would look 
better as it zooms around in a Flash 
animation.
If you missed Helvetica but find 
yourself called by the fabulous world 
of typefaces and fonts, you'll have 
to wait; its only playing in select 
theaters, but itll be out on DVD in 
November. In the meantime, check

game where you can stick the classic 
typeface on its Microsoft clone, Arial.

Slicing, broiling, chewing, and swallowing are such natural processes 
that singing about them is just as natural. Eating is one of life's purest 
visceral pleasures, so I present to you a list of songs about food (at 
least in name).
Cibo Matto  Artichoke "Artichoke is off of the Cibo Mattos 
magnum opus, Viva! La Woman, in which Cibo Matto presents to us a 
number of food-themed songs. Artichoke is the most serious" food 
and song on the album, beginning with a crumple and a clatter over 
a clunky piano. Its definitely not a fast food track  it oozes all over, 
and Hatoris voice glides along the distorted instruments. Can you 
squeeze a lemon on me? '
REM  Orange Crush Orange Crush is a deliciously sweet soda, 
and Ive always had a thing for this classic REM tune, in part because 
it refers to something so lighthearted as a soft drink. At least, thats 
what I used to think  according toWikipedia, Orange Crush is 
talking about Agent Orange. Huh. Well, at least this song, secretly 
about Vietnam, has the fun fizz of the soda. (Theres also a far more 
depressing version: the recent cover by Editors.)
Wiley  Pies Wiley is a British rapper who produced a subgenre of 
Grime he calls Eski," as in Eskimo, because his beats are so icy. The 
beats on Pies" sound like they were created by hitting massive icicles 
with mallets, so Wiley channels strangely serious hip-hop as he sings: 
Who ate.all the pies? (pies) / Who ate all the pies? (pies) / There goes 
Wiley, there goes Wiley, he ate all the pies, boy." Clearly, Pies is an 
incisive expos on urban life in London.
Coil  Broccoli You might think a song called Broccoli would be 
silly, and the gloomy clicking and chanting are so over the top that it is 
at least smirk-worthy. That is, until you realize the band is talking about 
the death of your parents, saying: Wise words from the departing: 
Eat your greens, especially broccoli. Always wear sensible shoes. 
Beyond creepy.
Smashing Pumpkins  Mayonaise I love mayonnaise, the 
condiment. Many people find it absolutely disgusting, but theres 
something fabulous about its semi-gelatinous giggle smothered all 
over French fries. Theres also something fabulous about Corgans 
voice smothered all over Mayonaise" [sic]. Mayonaise" presents 
a shockingly perfect balance of breathiness, guitar distortion, and 
indulgent, adolescent angst. Fans adore it, along with the better-known 
tracks off Siamese Dream like Disarm and Cherub Rock. Its almost 
depressing to listen to the overdramatic, whiny new Pumpkins album 
 alongside the intricate, sensitive Siamese Dream  but that's a 
different column entirely.

SOG wEPnr Dont miss a calorie
Ketchup on first 12 episodes in time for the finale
Now in its third season, Bravo's Top Chef is down to four 
contestants, with the finale coming up this week. On the 
show, contestants compete in a Quickfire Challenge to get 
their culinary juices flowing, followed by an Elimination 
Challenge, the loser of which must hear host Padma 
Lakshmi's fatal words: "Pack your knives and go.
In case you missed the beginning of this season, heres a look 
at whats happened so far:
1. First Impressions Meet the cast of season three: two 
Saras, two mohawks, and a variety of funny hats, among other 
oddities. For the Quickfire Challenge, the contestants have to 
make an amuse bouche (a bite-size bit that will amuse the 
judges' palates) out of the remains of their welcome party's 
catered hors doeuvres. Micah wins, and-Clay (the southern 
underdog) humiliates himself by making something larger 
than bite-size. Howie only manages to complete half of his 
dish, but the judges prefer his half-dish to a whole one by 
Clay, who is eliminated.
2. Sunny Delights The Elimination Challenge calls 
for upscale barbecue, which proves to be harder than it 
sounds. Howie has trouble with the time limit once again, as 
he struggles with slow-cooking pork. Joeys chicken (fingerlicking required) is hardly upscale, but Sandys poached 
lobster, not at all barbecue, sends her home.
3. Family Favorites For the Quickfire 
Challenge, contestants have to fish out conch,
Seven layers of heave
Seven-layer dip is fun to tantalizing;

crayfish, and other underwater goodies before they cook 
them  Brian, who works at a seafood restaurant, wins. The 
Elimination Challenge asks for reinvented family classics. 
Howie wins (and redeems himself) with pork chops; Dale 
daringly uses mashed potatoes from a box in his chicken 
dumplings; C.J.'s tuna casserole comes out an unappetizing 
slime green; and Micah goes home for her uninformed 
meatloaf (shes from South Africa, after all).
4. Cooking By Numbers Episode four begins with booze 
as contestants have to make dishes inspired by various 
cocktails by Bombay Sapphire  oh, product placement. 
Casey wins this Quickfire Challenge, earning herself 
immunity. In the team-based Elimination Challenge, Dale, 
Camille, and Sara M. wind up in trouble for a trio of pineapplethemed desserts, and Camille (who had barely been on 
camera all season) gets the boot.
5. "Latin Lunch" The chefs use frozen pie crusts for the 
Quickfire Challenge, and Joeys tarts wind up taking the cake. 
For the Elimination Challenge, the contestants are asked to 
create a Latin-infused lunch for the cast of Telemundo's Dame 
Chocolate. Joey and Howie (easily remembered as the two 
fat obnoxious guys) finish in the top two, and Lias whiteness 
betrays her in a lackluster polenta, which sends her home.
6. Freezer Burn" A Quickfire Smelling (and Tasting)
Bee tests the contestants food-recognition skills: Can 
they recognize a kidney bean by sight, a bowl of 
fish paste by taste? Apparently, Casey can. For the 
Elimination Challenge, chefs pair up to create frozen 
dinners and try to sell them to customers at a local 
supermarket. The contestants are each-given a bag 
111 of Bertolli frozen pasta to understand' the science 
C behind freezing your food, but only two of the 
fs four teams are smart enough to freeze their 
I |*j|K components in separate bags (otherwise, your
1 pasta turns into a soggy disaster  see Joey and 
Hungs dish.) C.J. and Tre win the challenge  
and trips to Italy  and Joey gets sent home; Tin 
not gonna cry, he says, moments before bursting into tears.
7. Guilty Pleasures Product placement takes a turn for 
the delicious with a Coldstone-inspired Quickfire Challenge. 
Dale wins, and the judges give the contestants a night off to 
go to a party  very suspicious. The girls get all dolled up in 
halter tops and heels, but when the chefs arrive at the party, it 
turns out theyre only there to cook (except for Dale  he gets 
to sit out with the judges.) Brian works the party manning a 
raw bar up front, but Sara N. never gets past the fact she has 
to cook in a tank top, and winds up eliminated.
8. Restaurant Wars" A Red Robin Quickfire Challenge 
alienates half the remaining contestants when guest judge 
chef Boulud informs them that their burgers are actually 
"sandwiches. The chefs embark on the infamous "Restaurant 
Wars Elimination Challenge, where they split into teams
of two and open their own restaurants. C.J., who won the 
Quickfire, gets to pick his teammates, and he chooses Casey, 
Brian, and Tre  which leaves the motley foursome of Howie, 
Sara M., Hung, and Dale. Faced with failure from both teams
 a grossly perspiring Brian, chunky risotto from Howie, and 
an uninspired tartar by Hung  the judges decide not to 
eliminate anyone and give the contestants another episode to 
get it right.
9. "Second Helping" C.J.s hand-selected dream team pales 
in comparison to the group of lovable underdogs, lead by head 
chef Sara M. The latter wins a relay-style Quickfire Challenge,
pillbox 09.24.07

rewarding them with the help of season ones nincompoopish sommelier Stephen. Sara M. team steps up the game and 
wins the challenge, while Tre gets sent home for crafting a 
garlic-infused disaster.
10. "Chef Overboard A cutesy Quickfire Challenge 
demands that the seven remaining chefs use ingredients 
from specific grocery aisles. Brian wins with a surprisingly 
delicious Spam-filled creation. For the Elimination Challenge, 
the chefs cater a yacht party, where Casey's contributions 
are a hit, but Howies cigar-inspired hors doeuvres send him 
home.
11. Snacks on a Plane Padma, the lovely host, awakens 
the contestants and makes them cook her breakfast in their 
pajamas for the Quickfire Challenge. Hung wins with steak 
and eggs, along with a blended smoothie that looks about 
half alcohol  he knows how Padma likes her sauce. The 
Elimination Challenge asks the chefs to cook first-class airline, 
food to be cooked and served aboard a Continental Airlines 
craft. Casey wins for the second time in a row, while C.J.s 
broccolini looks, as guest judge Anthony Bourdain declares, 
like it came out of a trash can. That being said, C.J. goes home.
12. Manhattan Transfer The chefs make it to New York 
City, where they encounter a Quickfire Challenge afLe Cirque 
restaurant, hosted by guest chef Sirio Maccioni. The chefs 
have to recreate Maccionis famous halibut dish;. Hung pulls
it off with finesse, while Sara M. serves the judges a still-raw 
creation. For the Elimination Challenge, contestants have to 
use three classic ingredients: Chicken, potatoes, and onions. 
And its pretty much the Quickfire all over again: Hung wins 
with a well-crafted butter-poached chicken, while Sara M. 
gets sent home for serving her poultry undercooked.
With the finale on its way, only four contestants remain in 
the competition. To see what happens, check out Top Chef 
Wednesday night at 10 p.m. on Bravo (channel 15 on campus, 
175 on digital cable.)

If youre in the mood for a

for Irish accents, The Wind That 
Shakes the Barley has it all. Set 
in Ireland during the 1920s, the 
film follows two brothers while 
also depicting the struggle 
between Britain and Ireland. 
Though it didnt do too well in 
the U.S., the movie gives a great 
look into the atrocities commited 
by the Black and Tan Squad 
and is well done overall. Plus, it 
has Cillian Murphy in it.

Gladys Schi
A look back at the legacy
Next week is the 35th anniversary of the death of Gladys Schmitt, the 
founder of the creative writing department at Carnegie Mellon.
Gladys (she always requested that people call her Gladys) was born in 
Pittsburgh in 1909. Even as a young child she wrote, producing plays, poems, 
and novels before turning 20. She began school on a scholarship to Chatham 
University, at the time called the Pennsylvania College for Women, and later 
transferred to the University of Pittsburgh.
When Gladys graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, she took a job as 
an editor for Scholastic magazines and moved to New York City with her 
husband Simon Goldfield. Early in 1942, they returned to Pittsburgh, where 
she began teaching at Carnegie Mellon (then called the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology) for a full salary of $1800 a year. Also in 1942, Dial Press published 
Gladyss first novel, The Gates ofAulis, which won the Dial Press Award for 
new fiction. Following Aulis, Gladys went on to publish several short stories 
and eight additional novels, many of which became Literary Guild selections 
and bestsellers.
In her last novel  and best, as some would argue  The Godforgotten, 
published in 1972, an islands inhabitants are cut off from the rest of 
humankind just before the year 1000 CE, when an earthquake destroys 
their connection to the mainland. They believe God has left them behind 
and continue to live this way for multiple generations; thus the novel deals 
with the loss of Christanity, the loss of morals, and the loss of a foundation to 
judge.
But Gladys cannot simply be understood by the narratives of her novels. In 
an essay about her, lifelong friend Sarah Strauss wrote, "Gladys worked very 
hard, and she was an extraordinary teacher. The course she designed ... 
Thought and Expression she called it  became famous at the school."
Thought and Expression was just the beginning of her work reforming 
classes and curriculum at Carnegie Mellon. She started the creative writing 
department in 1968, when there were only a few creative writing programs in 
the country and the field was just coming into its own. Gladys hired much of 
the department's faculty, including Gerald Costanzo, who is still a professor 
at Carnegie Mellon, where he teaches poetry and directs the university press.
Costanzo described the early days in the department, which Gladys had 
established entirely around her vision of the way students should be taught 
creative writing. He joked that the prospectus was the size of a small town 
phone book,... but to this day very little has changed from that original 
guide." The very heart of the creative writing department, including the main 
classes and the way the workshops function, has not strayed from Gladyss 
views on the writing process.
In 2001, the department dedicated the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing 
Center  the Glad, as students faithfully call it. The center is a place for them 
to work, socialize, and experience an education that would have made her 
proud.
Still, it is impossible to capture a person just by his or her work. Costanzo 
described how Gladys frequently held Paris-style literary salons in her house 
on Wilkins Avenue. According to Costanzo, Gladys's salon became a central 
hub for the literary discussions in Pittsburgh; she would sit, listening and 
patiently working on her needlepoint, as the discussion moved around her. 
She was easily the most accomplished writer in Pittsburgh and was a local 
celebrity, described as the literary darling of Pittsburgh.
And this was her routine: Gladys would wake in the mornings and write for

nitt: The darling of Pittsburgh
of Carnegie Mellons most beloved novelist

two hours before coming in to Carnegie Mellon. There she would spend her 
day with the students and other professors; Gladys taught her fellow faculty 
as much as the students, Costanzo said. In the evening she would return 
home to her husband, frequently having people over to her house  a house 
she purchased with the money from her second novel, David the King.
When Gladys died in early October 1972 from heart failure, it was a shock to 
the community. Earlier that year she had won the Ryan Award for Meritorious 
Teaching, and she had been, as always, actively involved in writing and 
working with students. The Tartan published a short retrospective on her life 
in its next issue, saying she would be deeply missed.
Sonnets to an Analyst was published after Gladyss death. This book is a . 
collection of 69 sonnets written for her therapist, whom she had been seeing 
after an emotional breakdown in the early 60s. Gladys had held off on 
publishing them because she was afraid they would not fit in with literature 
at the time, which centered around free verse, but her husband published 
them shortly after her death. The book remains in print, having been reissued 
by the Carnegie Mellon University Press in 2004.
Gladys was popular while she was alive; she won numerous awards, had her 
books and stories published, made a living off of her work, and frequently had 
her novels reviewed positively by the critics. By most measures she was a 
successful author. But over the last 35 years much of that has disappeared. 
Outside of the creative writing department, even here on campus where she 
was once a much-loved professor, it is hard to find students who recognize 
her name outside the room in Baker. Nearly all of her books are out of print, 
though they can be relatively easily tracked down in secondhand Pittsburgh 
area bookstores.
Of Gladyss lack of staying power, some say she did not establish a large 
enough canon as a writer, others that she did not have enough drama in her 
life while she was alive to become as nationally popular as she could have 
been. Costanzo attributes it to a trend of writers from her era who believed 
they, in his words, gained a universal meaning by not mentioning anything 
local. Neither Pittsburgh nor Carnegie Mellon are mentioned by name 
in Gladys's work, though they are both used as settings and had a strong 
influence on what she wrote.
Gladys sits at a typewriter. She is the 
namesake of the Gladys Schmitt Creative 
Writing Center in Baker Hall and an 
inspiration to many current professors 
and students.
Hunt Library hosts the Gladys Schmitt Collection, an assortment of resources 
just waiting to be rediscovered. The collection includes typescripts and 
manuscripts of many of her novels, correspondence, photographs, and 
unpublished works. There is also a box of student work and early themes, 
along with copies of all nine of her published novels with contemporary critic 
reviews, many first editions, and other fragments donated by her friends and 
family members to the library.
Gladys was a cornerstone of the Carnegie Mellon community, a dedicated 
teacher, and an accomplished novelist. Next week, as we begin our 36th year 
without her on campus, we should remember where we can find her: in the 
creative writing center that bears her name, in her novels and papers in the 
library, and in the principles of the creative writing department.
Those who remember Gladyss novels remember them for their eloquent 
prose, their compelling stories, and most of all their detailed and profoundly 
human characters. Barbara Beyer, a former student, recounted in an essay 
on Gladys, "Character, [she] said, was the base strength of all good fiction. 
People like to read about people. She quoted a fan letter she had received 
after publication of Rembrandt. T am an old woman who scrubs floors with 
my grandbaby beside me, but I read your book. I cry for you. I cry for me. I cry 
for my baby grand-daughter. That is what a book must do, she said.

Carnegie Museum of Art celebrates a century-old collection
On a Grand Scale, an exhibition at the Carnegie Museum of 
Art, commemorates the 100th anniversary of the museums 
collection of architectural and artistic replicas, established by 
Andrew Carnegie in 1907.
Artists have made plaster casts since the fourth century BCE, 
with the Greeks reproduction of marble statues, and artists 
continued to use casts into the 19th century. Reproductions 
existed as a cultural phenomenon, driven from a widespread 
view that a replica was better than an original. Today, most 
collections have been dispersed or destroyed due to a public 
surge against copying art, as well as the fragility of the 
artworks themselves.
"We will see a collection of the greatest things in the world 
in this, Architecture Hall, Carnegie said in 1901. Within 
six years, Carnegie had amassed 144 architectural casts,
69 plaster reproductions of famous sculptures, and 360 
replicas in bronze. As the largest architectural cast collection 
in the world (rivaled in depth only by Muse National des 
Monuments Franais in Paris and Londons Victoria and
Albert Museum), the collection has remained intact in its 
customized sky-lit space.
The hall was inspired by one of the seven wonders of the 
world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which is viewed 
as an architectural and aesthetic triumph. The collection 
features pieces representative of various artistic movements 
and periods. However, more than just providing aesthetic 
pleasure, the collection harkens back to our intellectual 
foundations with famous pieces representative of the Greeks. 
Reproductions of Venus de Milo, sculptures from the East 
Pediment of the Parthenon, Caryatides, and the Diskobolos 
are just a few of the works available.
The hall allows visitors to view a variety of architectural and 
sculptural works without leaving Pittsburgh.

at Capristo, where special massage and nail treatments are 
close to magical. Check it out if you want to feel

Mirrors are really 
frightening objects 
when you think 
about them.
You trust it to show 
you how you look, 
but in reality, 
what you 
see in the 
mirror is your 
exact 
opposite.
Maybe thats 
also why the 
happiest people 
are those who 
never seem to 
look in a mirror 
at all.
They have no 
color of their 
own, instead 
only copying 
what they
reflect.No wonder 
so many people 
are facing 
crises of 
identity.

You will be chosen as king/queen of the castle until the coup dtat a 
day later.
Right now a baby is being born and will be named after you, or at least
have your same exact name.
Nobody will ask you for a cigarette or a pen or anything else today, just 
as long as you keep your shoe laces untied.
A butterfly will lose its wings and fall into your food today. A day later, a 
flying squirrel will gain its wings and fly into your food.
Nothing will happen; you will be in a void all week.
Check your mail for pickles and they will come.
Next time you look out your bedroom window, you will see a gang of 
motionless garden gnomes. If you look twice, you will perceive that, 
previously, one gnomes right arm had been raised. Not the left.
You will need to wear a name tag this week if you want to pass your 
classes.
Avoid your mailbox for a few days or until the swelling goes down.
You will get squirted in the face by a water fountain and you wont 
remember how you got to the fountain.
Your breath will smell like your feet, so make sure to wear clean 
socks.
Something extremely important will happen to. you but that will be 
dwarfed when your friend wins the lottery.
