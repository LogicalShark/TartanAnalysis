Office expands aid options
Student Affairs offers scholarship info
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Finding and applying for schol
arships and fellowships can be a 
difficult process. Student Affairs 
hopes to change this with the 
establishment of the Office of
ship information from the associ
ate deans of various departments 
and puts it all together. The of
fice maintains the bulletin board, 
emu.scholarshipsfellowships.announce, and also 
has a database of over 200 schol
arships and fellowships. Students
We consider ourselves to be a virtual 
clearing house of information, "
 Thomas Keating, director of the 
Office of Scholarships and Fellowships
Scholarships and Fellowships.
The Office of Scholarships and 
Fellowships was formerly part of 
Student Employment, but be
came its own entity when the 
Student Employment office closed 
this summer.
The office provides information 
on where to go to apply for differ
ent programs. It gathers scholarcan sign out a disk from the of
fice, located in Warner Hall 328, 
which contains the database in 
MS-Word and Filemaker Pr for
mats. There are also plans to put 
up a server for the files.
Frankly, were not in charge of 
all the programs; we consider 
ourselves to be a virtual clearing
house of information, said Thomas M. Keating, director of the 
Office of Scholarships and Fel
lowships and former director of 
Student Employment.
We will officially be the office 
of primary responsibility for six 
scholarships ourselves, and those 
[scholarships] will be the 
Goldwater, the Churchill, 
the Beineke, the National 
Foundation, the Depart
ment of Defense, an&the 
Hertz, he said. The ma
jority of the scholarships 
are for graduate students, 
but some, such as the 
Goldwater scholarship, 
are for undergraduates. 
Actually, the same service has 
been provided for about five years 
through the office of Student 
Employment. I started out five 
years ago, and was just given 
some files and told to do some
thing. The Filemaker database 
we now have is much better,

Heavy U.S. military presence prevents Iraqi designs on Kuwait
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (AP)  Iraq 
once again is talking war against Ku
wait. But the threat; however unnerv
ing to Kuwaitis, is probably nothing 
more than that  talk.
Evenif the U.S.-built defensive shieldin 
the Persian Gulf fails to dissuade Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein from grabbing for 
Kuwait again, it would give him almost no 
chance to repeat the success of August 
1990, when his army rolled over Kuwait 
with virtually no armed resistance.
Its already too late [for Saddam to 
make a successful move on Kuwait, given 
the extra firepower the U.S. military is 
now moving into the areal, said Robert 
Gates, who was CIA director in the Bush 
administrations final year.
Might Saddam try anyway?
With American control of the air, that 
would be an exceptionally stupid act, 
Gates said Thursday. He and other pri
vate analysts said they saw little possi
bility Iraq would attack Kuwait, but 
they were unwilling to rule it out.
Kuwait had been quiet in the latest 
U.S.-Iraqi confrontation, which focused 
mainly on Iraqi aggression in northern
Iraq. That changed when the Pentagon 
announced last Wednesday that Kuwait 
had agreed to let eight U.S. Air Force F117A stealth fighter-bombers use a Ku
waiti air base for potential strikes on 
Iraq.
That amounts to an act of war against 
the Iraqi state, said Deputy Prime Minis
ter Tariq Aziz. He likened 
the situation to the 1990 
period just before Iraq in
vaded Kuwait, which the 
Iraqis consider a renegade 
Iraqi province.
But much has changed 
since 1990.
Although Kuwait may be ____________
only marginally more capable of defending itself 
against Iraq than it was six years ago, 
the United States, with help from Brit
ain and France, has developed a formi
dable defensive force in and around 
Kuwait.
 In Kuwait: The U.S. Army has stored 
enough tanks and other weapons and 
supplies to equip a full armored brigade 
of about 5,000 soldiers. On short notice
they could fly into Kuwait and link up 
with the equipment. There is a similar 
package of annar and supplies stashed 
in Qatar, just to the south.
The Army also has in Kuwait a Patriot 
air defense battalion whose missiles 
could be used not only against attacking 
Iraqi warplanes but also in the event
It's already too late [for Saddam to 
make a successful move on Kuwait] 
 Robert Gates, CIA director for 
former President Bush
Saddam launched Scud ballistic mis
siles toward Kuwait. Coincidentally, 
about1,200 U. S. soldiers from Fort Hood, 
Texas, and Fort McPherson, Georgia, 
are now conducting an exercise, Intrin
sic Action, in Kuwait.
 In Saudi Arabia: The U.S. Air Force 
has a powerful contingent of F-15 fighters 
and other aircraft, including an AWACS
early warning plane, which have been 
patrolling the skies over southern Iraq 
since 1992 from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
 In the Persian Gulf: The aircraft 
carrier USS Carl Vinson and its battle 
group are plying the Gulf waters, to be 
joined shortly by a second aircraft car
rier, the USS Enterprise. The U.S. 5th 
Fleet is based at 
Bahrain, just off the 
Saudi Gulf coast.
There was no U.S. 
carrier in the Gulf when 
Iraq invaded Kuwait 
six years ago.
Logic also would ar
gue against an Iraqi 
I attack on Kuwait, if, 
as many Westerners 
believe, one of Saddams top priorities is 
splitting the United States from its Arab 
allies in the Gulf. Logic, however, has 
not always been the best guide in trying 
to predict or interpret the Iraqi leaders 
military actions.
After investing billions of dollars and 
spilling American and allied blood to 
oust the Iraqi army from Kuwait in
1990, the United States is taking noth
ing for granted.
President Clinton has proven on at 
least two occasions that he is not going 
to let Kuwait be threatened by Iraq on 
the ground, said Harry G. Summers, 
Jr., a retired Army colonel who monitors 
American military capabilities.
Summers was referring to two episodes
 in October 1994 and August 1995  
which demonstrated that even a hint of 
Iraqi troop movements toward the Kuwaiti 
border will trigger an immediate reinforce
ment of U.S. firepower in the Gulf.
In the 1994 episode, the Iraqi army sent 
a large force toward the Kuwaiti border in 
what Washington viewed as the start of 
another invasion. Clinton ordered U.S.' 
air, sea and ground reinforcements to the 
Gulf. Saddam backed off.
Last August, the Pentagon put large 
numbers of U.S. forces on alert for movement to the Gulf after U.S. intelligence 
picked up indications that some Iraqi 
troops south of Baghdad might be pre
paring to head south. The threat never 
materialized, but U.S. officials said they; 
were unwilling to just watch and wait.
United Way kicks off its yearly campaign with a Day of Caring
By JENNIFER GARCIA de OSUNA
Tartan Assistant Forum Editor
Last Friday, the campus was bustling 
with about 50 seventh and eighth grade 
National Honor Society students from
the Sterret School as CMU kicked off its 
1996 United Way campaign with a Day 
of Caring.'
The day was CMUs way of starting off 
the United Way fundraising campaign 
and, at the same time, giving some time
Eva Bai/Tartan Junior Staff 
3svnxdsp yet, 3sxeexs 3IlttH xdUt.xn S nS. ty ItHHxAx Hayx HSps meanS. Ss Ofig
to the community.
The T)ay of Caring5 is very distinct 
from the campaign, said Mark S. 
Kamlet, dean of the Heinz School and 
this years coordinator of the United 
Way campaign. From September 30 to 
October 10, the faculty and staff make 
monetary pledges to United Way. This 
first day is a way to get things going.
In past years, these kick-offs usually 
comprised of faculty and staff volunteer
ing at a non-profit organization. This year, 
CMU decided it would be better to bring 
the service to campus. They then orga
nized a field trip for the students of Sterret 
School and offered them a day in college.
Working with these kids was a good 
opportunity, said Kamlet. These are 
kids in a magnet program and [they] 
are really very bright. They come from 
a diverse socio-economic background. 
They are all entering a time in their 
lives where they have many different 
choices, and we want them to keep in 
mind that their education should be 
their top priority.
Im very excited about this years 
Day of Caring, said Carl Berdnik, 
Principal of Sterret School. Whatever 
it takes to keep these kids motivated 
and in school is an invaluable service to 
the community.
The students were offered a tour of 
campus, lunch in the University Cen
ter, and many other activities such as a 
visit to the robots in the Robotics lab 
and a look at costuming in the Drama 
department. The Day of Caring was 
designed to let young students know 
what college life is all about in hopes 
that they get motivated to one day go to
college themselves.
I have always given money to and 
volunteered for United Way, said Chris
tina Moore, junior H&SS student. I 
thought that the Day of Caring was a 
creative way to kill two birds with one 
stone. We got kids to get excited about 
college, and we got the campus to be
come aware about United Way.
Im very enthusiastic aboutthis years
campaign, said Kamlet. With the heir 
of our faculty, staff, and students, In 
confident that well be even more suc
cessful in 1996 than we have been in 
previous years.
Starting September 30th, pledge ma
terial will go out to all of the faculty and,' 
staff. They will be asked to make mon
etary contributions throughout the cam
paign period and will receive free pop
corn when they turn in their pledge 
card. The money raised throughout the; 
campaign will go to United Way and 
then distributed to other non-profit or-, 
ganizations.
There are several non-profit organiza
tions with diverse services that try to 
raise money and focus on their own 
group.
The United Way combines forces 
through a community-wide effort to col
lect money and then split it up in a 
predefined way to the other service or
ganizations. By donating to the United 
Way, people know that their money is 
going directly to a service, not to aid in 
more fundraising.
I am very anxious for student help in 
this years campaign, said Kamlet. If 
anyone is interested to help out with 
popcorn booths or other activities, I urge 
them to call my office or email me.

U.S. soldiers involved in another assault in Japan
TOKYO, Sept. 12 (AP)In another 
embarrassment for officials trying to 
quell an anti-U.S. military uproar on 
__ Okinawa, police on Friday began ques; tioning two U.S. Marines, one from 
; Oklahoma, suspected of assaulting and 
| robbing a 56-year-old woman.
The assault comes just days after 
; Okinawans voted 10-1 for a reduction 
; in the huge U.S. military presence on 
; their islands.
The vote Sunday, the first referen
dum of its kind ever held in Japan, 
was prompted by anger on Okinawa 
since three U.S. GIs raped a 12-yearold Okinawan girl one year ago.
Military officials on Okinawa, which
This regrettable incident 
was taken seriously by our 
command. "
 Gen. J. Michael Hayes
losts nearly 30,000 U.S. troops, have 
cracked down on misbehavior since 
ast years rape, but several incidents 
lave been reported  including at 
east two sexual assaults by foreign
ers, one right outside a U.S. base.
Senior Japanese and American oficials met for a new round of talks on 
that issue Friday.
In the latest incident, Marine Cor
poral Jeremy Wright of Stillwater, 
Oklahoma, and Corporal Brian 
3ergen ofConnersville, Indiana, both 
stationed at Camp Hansen on
Okinawa, allegedly attacked bar 
owner Toshiko Gakiya, 56, at around 
midnight Wednesday, said Japanese 
and U.S. military officials.
Japanese police, quoting Gakiya, 
said she saw them removing money 
from her purse as she was losing 
consciousness.
Gakiyas bar is just outside Camp 
Hansen in the central Okinawan town 
of Ishikawa. The two Marines were 
being held Friday in the Camp Hansen 
brig, according to Marine Captain 
Kim Miller.
I sincerely hope the victim recov
ers quickly and fully from this unfor
tunate incident, said Brigade Gen__________ eral J. Michael Hayes,
commander of Marine 
Corps Camp Butler. 
This regrettable inci
dent was taken seriously 
by our command. 
Elsewhere in Japan, 
police said Thursday that
__________two U.S. sailors and two
teen-age Japanese girls 
were being held in Japanese custody 
on suspicion of using illegal stimu
lant drugs at Yokosuka Navy Base, 
45 kilometers (28 miles) southwest of 
Tokyo.
The girls, aged 16 and 17, allegedly 
bought illegal stimulants from the 
two 21-year-old sailors assigned to 
the aircraft carrier Independence. The 
sailors were charged on August 30.
Okinawa, which accounts for less 
than 1 percent of the total Japanese 
land area, is burdened with 75 percent 
of the U.S. military facilities in Japan.
Pirates consider new look
* PITTSBURGH, Sept. 12 (AP)  
&ne Pittsburgh Pirates are gambling 
their fans will buy into their new look, 
j Three new uniforms. Three new caps. 
New jackets. A new logo. The Pirates 
will make plenty of changes in 1997  
maybe new players, too, if owner Kevin 
McClatchy orders more trades.
 Were changing everything, Pi
rates marketing Vice President Steve 
tereenberg said Wednesday. This 
wasnt a marketing decision but an 
organizational decision, because were 
changing the whole package. There 
are some very neat changes.
| The uniforms will be previewed ei
ther before Christmas  even though 
not all of the new items will be avail
able for sale by then  or just before 
spring training begins in February.
 Of course, new uniforms are old hat 
to the Pirates.
j To celebrate Three Rivers Stadiums 
opening in 1970, they became the .first
major league team to trade traditional 
baggy, flannel uniforms for polyester 
knit tops and pants. Within five years, 
every team in the majors had switched.
In 1978, they were the first  and 
lastNational League team to adopt 
a rotating set of uniforms that incor
porated nine different variations, in
cluding all-gold, all-black and a goldand-black pinstripe design.
The Pirates are not the only profes
sional sports team in town to make 
uniform changes. Last season, the 
Penguins successfully introduced a 
new third jersey that incorporated 
black and gold with blue stripes from 
the franchises original color scheme. 
And in 1997, due to a change in uni
form suppliers, the Steelers will 
streamline a look that has remained 
mostly unchanged since the late 
1960s.
The changes will not alter the teams 
basic black-and-gold look.
School stampede kills 24 in China
BEIJING, Sept. 13 (AP)  Children 
rushing to attend a school flag-raising 
ceremony, stampeded over each other, 
crushing 24 to death and injuring an
other 74, according to reports today.
After the 7:20 am bell sounded for the 
flag raising, children at the Nanbing 
primary school in southwestern Yunnan 
province rushed from a back building, 
Chinas state-run media reported.
Students tumbled in a 9-foot-wide 
passageway at the foot of a stairway, 
and those behind kept coming. Within 
minutes, more than 200 children were 
piled on top of each other.
School officials, teachers, neighbors, 
police, and army personnel worked Mon
day to rescue the children, but 24 died 
of suffocation, the newspaper reports 
said.
Polls say Clinton lead widening
NEW YORK, Sept 12 (AP)  Republi
can defections plague Bob Dole as sup
port for President Clintons re-election 
has grown broader and deeper since the 
party conventions, according to a na
tional poll released Thursday.
The Pew Research Center survey found 
increased general support since July for 
Democratic congressional candidates. 
But 62 percent favored their incumbent 
representative, compared with 49 per
cent a month before Republicans gained 
majorities in the House and Senate in 
1994.
Many Republicans dont seem excited 
about the top of their ticket, though. Only 
81 percent of Republicans and 59 percent 
of independents who lean toward the 
GOP say they would vote for Dole if the 
election were today; 90 percent of Demo' crats and 79 percent of I)emocratic-leaning independents favor Clinton.
Overall, 52 percent of the 1,141 regis
tered voters in the Sept. 5-8 Pew poll 
supported Clinton, 34 percent backed 
Dole and 8 percent favored Reform Party 
nominee Ross Perot. Thats an 8-point 
gain for Clinton and 8-point drop for 
Perot since late July. Doles support was 
unchanged.
Pews top line numbers are similar to 
those in other recent national polls. The 
latest CNN-USA Tocfay-Gallup tracking 
poll, conducted Monday through Wednes
day, found the race at 55-34-5, un
changed all week in the nightly surveys.
But Pew found that 47 percent of vot
ers now say they have decided definitely 
not to vote for Dole, up from 40 percent 
in late July. Half of Dole voters say their 
support is primarily opposition to Clinton 
and Perot, while fewer than one in three 
Clinton backers say their votes are 
mainly against his opponents.
Clintons image has improved since 
the July Pew poll. Doles hasnt. Dole 
had an advantage over Clinton only as
being more honest and truthful and on 
cutting taxes. Clinton had strong leads 
on 12 other issues and personal quali
ties and was viewed slightly more favor
ably than Dole on keeping promises, 
making wise foreign policy decisions, 
and reducing the federal budget deficit.
As evidence of Republicans lukewarm 
support for Dole, they were split over 
whether Clinton or Dole are more per
sonally likable and which candidate con
nects well with ordinary Americans.
The margin of sampling error is plus 
or minus 3 percentage points for the full 
sample of 1,508 adults.
Pigeon shootings anger Hollywood
HARRISBURG, Sept. 12 (AP)  Film 
star Alec Baldwin and Hollywood pro
ducers and screenwriters have told Gov
ernor Tom Ridge they wont shoot mov
ies here if Pennsylvanians keep shoot
ing pigeons.
Baldwin, an animal-rights activist, 
wrote to Ridge that he was outraged 
about the Hegins Labor Day pigeon shoot 
in Schuylkill County, which draws thou
sands of spectators each year.
This event is a slaughter and an em
barrassment to the residents of your 
state, the actor wrote.
About 6,000 pigeons are rounded up for 
the shoot, which has been a Hegins tradi
tion for 63 years. Opponents say the event 
exposes children to violence, because or
ganizers pay trapper boys to twist the 
necks of wounded birds. The event raises 
about $40,000 for the community.
Baldwins letter was part of a package 
of 27 certificates signed by film-industry 
people and compiled by the Fund for 
Animals in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Other names included Clueless star 
Alicia Silver stone; Denis Leary, who 
starred in Two if by Sea; and screen
writer Barry Morrow, who won an Oscar 
for Rain Man.
Movie making has become big busi
ness in Pennsylvania, generating $34.5 
million in 1995. Last year, 13 movies 
were filmed in Pennsylvania, according 
to commerce officials. Since 1990, 44 
feature films and television movies have 
been made in Pittsburgh alone.
Baldwin and one film producer, Allen
town native Beth Dolan of Coyote Pass 
Productions, said they would spread the 
word about Pennsylvanias barbaric go
ings-on.
The threat has not prompted produc
ers to cancel film agreements, said state 
commerce spokeswoman Lynn Lawson. 
Two movies are being shot in Pennsylva
nia  one starring Michael Keaton in 
Pittsburgh and another starring Jean 
Claude Van Damme in Philadelphia.
Celebrities have petitioned Ridge on 
other causes, such as death-row inmate 
Mumia Abu Jamals efforts to win free
dom, said the governors spokesman Tim 
Reeves. But those efforts have not 
swayed him in the past and will not 
change his opinion now, Reeves said.
No charges filed against officer
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 13 (AP) The 
families of two men killed by a police 
officer while he was being dragged along
side a speeding car are deciding whether 
to file a civil rights lawsuit or take other 
legal action, a lawyer said.
The family of Maurice Hall was disap
pointed and distraught Thursday upon 
leamingno charges would be filed against 
Officer John Wilbur, said Wendy Will
iams, an attorney for Halls relatives.
Allegheny County District Attorney 
Bob Colvilles announcement came im
mediately after Coroner Cyril Wecht 
recommended that Colville not prosecute 
Wilbur, despite a 4-2 vote from a coroners 
jury that Wilbur be charged.
Williams said Wecht should have fol
lowed his own jurys advice.
Why bother? Why ask six people to 
make that tough decision and then not 
follow what they have to say? she said.
Critics have cited the case as an ex
ample of police brutality against blacks. 
City and police officials face a classaction lawsuit accusing them of a pat
tern of brutality in other cases, and the 
City Council has called for a citizen-run 
police review board.
Wilbur, 28, who is white, was leaning 
into a car June 26 to question Hall, 
Craig Guest and James Mitchell, who 
are black, when Mitchell sped off, police 
said. Wilburs left hand was caught in 
the rear door. As he was dragged, he 
shot into the back window of the car with 
his right hand until he was thrown free, 
Wilbur testified.
Hall, 20, and Guest, 19, both of Pitts
burgh, were killed. Mitchell is in jail and 
declined to testify at a contentious twoday coroners inquest that ended 
Wednesday.
Pittsburgh teen 
faces 130 years
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 12 (AP)A 17- 
year-old Pittsburgh youth could face up 
to 130 years in prison after pleading 
guilty to bank robbery.
Jammar Shelton admitted Wednes
day to sticking up a half dozen down
town banks last fall. He was 16 at the 
time.
His getaway vehicle in four of the 
robberies was a public bus.
Shelton was tried as an adult because 
of what the Allegheny County district 
attorneys office called the sophistica
tion of his crimes. His sentencing was 
set for October 24.
Shelton said he threatened tellers and 
ordered them to fill bags with money. He 
was caught November 30, together with 
three accomplices, after robbing an 
Integra Bank branch.
Three other people are awaiting trial 
for their roles in the last two stick-ups, 
including Sheltons aunt.

From National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, Oct. 22,1946: 
The party scene soared on cam
pus in CITs first full year after 
the war.
The freshman dance was held 
to acquaint new students with 
members of the other classes, it 
was announced that a band once 
backed by Frank Sinatra would 
play at the prom, the womens 
dorms sponsored a pajama party 
and bridge party, and fraterni
ties and sororities welcomed 
pledges as rush season ended.
CIT also announced plans from 
numerous reverends and rabbis 
to participate in memorial ser
vices for Tech men and women 
killed during the war.
25 YEARS AGO, Sept. 30, 
1971: The U.S. Senate passes the 
draft extension bill which autho
rized President Nixon to end un
dergraduate deferments to the 
Selective Service System. This 
overhaul started with all new stu
dents, though they were allowed 
to postpone induction until the 
end of the present term if they 
had already started classes.
All other students became eli
gible for induction after four years
in college or when they reached 
24 years of age, whichever came 
first. Also, Nixon requested a new 
rule that made the draft boards 
more equitable.
It was also noted that conscien
tious objectors were given twoyear assignments to civilian ser
vice.
10 YEARS AGO, Sept. 23, 
1986:. Two Delta Upsilon frater
nity brothers were injured by a 
party crasher wielding a knife at 
a rush party.
At 3:08 am, at least two people 
who were not CMU students tried 
to crash DUS Black and White 
party. The men where turned 
away by brothers patrolling the 
front door and were again re
fused when they sneaked around 
to the back door. It was there that 
the incidents occurred.
One brother received a severe 
cut on the bridge of his nose that 
required 18 stitches to close and 
another was injured with a two 
inch cut on the wrist.
Only the knife carrier was ar
rested and charged with aggra
vated assault, disorderly conduct, 
possession of an offensive weapon,
reckless endangerment, and tres
passing.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Sept. 16, 
1991: Six counts of negligence 
were brought before Student Sen
ate against The Thistle, in a dis
closure by the organizations 
former business manager Ross 
Comer.
The allegations included that 
the yearbook from the year be
fore was yet to be completed, the 
yearbook from the current year 
was tardy and incomplete, that 
The Thistle lacked an election or 
screening procedure for appoint
ments to leadership positions (in
cluding editor-in-chief), that the 
editor-in-chief had the ability to 
set his or her own salary, and 
that The Thistle significantly 
over-ordered yearbooks.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy said that theft of com
puter resources contributed to the 
problem of the delays. Also, 70 
pages in the 1990 yearbook were 
either not submitted by The Thistle 
or lost by the publisher. Another 
contributing factor, Comer said, 
was that there were no set guide
lines for running The Thistle.
ONE YEAR AGO, Sept. 18, 
1995: Vice President A1 Gore came 
to town to ask for student sup
port in the Democrats fight 
against proposed changes in fed
eral student aid programs. While 
Gore spoke, President Clinton 
attended a similar rally at South
ern Illinois University.
Congressional budget resolu
tions recommended that as much 
as $10.4 billion be cut from stu
dent loan programs.
Federal student aid programs 
that were targeted by Congress 
include the Pell Grant, the 
Perkins Loans, the interest ex
emption on Stafford Loans, and 
Clintons proposed direct lend
ing plan, where the government 
loans money directly to stu
dents, rather than through a 
bank.
The rally was sponsored by the 
student governments of Pittsburgh-area colleges and univer
sities, with help from the United 
States Student Association, a lob
bying group based in Washing
ton, D.C.

New office helps students find aid
SCHOLARSHIP, from page 1
for the Office of Scholarships and 
Fellowships.
The service this year is greatly 
expanded compared to previous 
years, with the addition of the 
bulletin board and taking over 
control of three scholarships. It 
used to be 10 percent of our func
tion, now its [one] hundred per
cent, said Branzel.
In addition to providing the 
database, the office also helps 
students submit the applica
tions. We try to get fairly com
prehensive with it, we can maybe 
even help them with interview 
skills for programs that might 
require an interview, said 
Keating.
The office also provides bro
chures to help with obtaining 
recommendations. There are 
also several brochures that we 
made last year. One of them is 
how to ask faculty people for 
letters of recommendation, and 
how to pick the right people to 
ask, and the other one is for the 
faculty on how to write letters
of recommendation, saiS* 
Keating.
The office has contacted the' 
GSO and other student organiza-"- 
tions in order to get the word out^ 
to students.
We really see this as a big plus' 
for the students. Its a service  
that has long been needed. Otherj 
schools have done it. Were really I 
excited and weve had a lot of; 
support from the academic as well j 
as the administrative side. This > 
is something the students really j 
deserve, said Keating.

Deans, students 
should meet socially
Students were recently in
vited, via e-mail, to have lunch 
with H&SS Deans Peter Stearns 
or Jay Devine (director of the 
H&SS academic advisory cen
ter), or SDS Professor Richard 
Smith. The invitation said that 
students would be able take time 
to discuss ideas or concerns in
volved in their majors, CMU, or 
their lives, in general.
It is this simple kind of open 
communication that must 
spread to all colleges.
Very often, professors and 
deans are looked upon as dis
tant and unapproachable. While 
this harsh opinion is not neces
sarily accurate, it is true that 
the authority of a teacher may 
put off some students, leaving 
them unable to discuss even the 
smallest problems. With the 
H&SS lunch, however, there is 
the reaffirmation that major fig
ures in the campus community 
care about the needs and opin
ions of their students.
The concept behind the deans1 
lunch idea should be taken as 
an example to all other colleges. 
Students should be able to take 
time out with their professors 
and speak to them openly. This 
may be augmented by supply
ing vouchers to campus dining 
areas where, if both professor
and student order together, a muf
fin or a cup of coffee would be 
provided at no charge. One of the 
goals of the University Center 
was j ust that  to provide a place 
where faculty and students can 
commingle. Why not help bring 
this goal to fruition?
Also, in addition to Deans List 
Dinners and focus groups orga
nized by colleges, why not supply 
informal meetings of students and 
faculty in a non-school setting, 
perhaps in a break room or lounge, 
much like the Industrial Man
agement departments Happy 
Hours. A time when students 
know that a group of their profes
sors will be available to chat is 
very liberating. It also suggests a 
new, group-oriented communica
tion, which complements one-onone office hours.
Simply put, all students should 
be afforded the opportunity and 
context to interact socially with 
college faculty and administra
tion. Consider also lunch with the 
President, lunch with alumni, or 
a coffee klatch of freshmen and 
upperclassmen.
The permutations and benefits 
are limitless. Itis important, in any 
light, that students feel that they 
have endless opportunities to speak 
with members of the campus com
munity open and freely.
Vendors must 
respect students
College students have a lot to 
deal with every day. There are 
academics, social issues, and 
personal finance decisions. In 
this context, CMU students do 
not need to be harassed by sales 
pitches from credit card ven
dors outside Doherty Hall.
These vendors have a specific 
product for students, and as 
capitalists, they have every right 
to attempt to sell it. However, 
what must match their level of 
enthusiasm for their product is 
their respect for us, the stu
dents.
When passing a credit card 
companys table, a student was 
actually asked Hey Pal, do you 
want a free toy? Being offered a 
slinky or a hacky-sack ball as 
motivation for making a finan
cial commitment would not fly 
in a professional setting, so why 
should the vendors assume that 
because we are college students 
that we should be susceptible to 
such mindless promotions?
Instead, credit card represen
tatives should offer lower, stu
dent rates, or perhaps discounts 
at area retail stores and restau
rants, in addition to the modal 
no annual fee. These would be 
far superior and effective incen
tives to sign on as a cardholder.
Perhaps one of the most dis
turbing problems with the mar
keting approach that the credit 
card vendors have taken is that 
it trivializes the important fi
nancial decisions that the ven
dors are asking students to 
make. Generally speaking, fi
nancial trends show that a 
young person will hold onto their 
first credit card for several years.

Fraternities fear failure in funds
James Stepanek
These types of decisions must be 
made judiciously, and these ven
dors seem to make it into some 
sort of game.
Another problem with these ven
dors is that they are often overly 
pursuant and accost students on 
the sidewalks. This campus, and 
particularly the areas around the 
main academic buildings like 
Doherty Hall, are no place for 
such active selling.
Students have enough to worry 
about without being bombarded 
with all sorts of unsolicited ploys. 
These corporate representatives 
can certainly learn a valuable les
son from some of the local mer
chants that also sell their goods 
on the CMU campus. Typically, 
these vendors will leave the stu
dents alone, knowing that they 
will seek their products out; the 
local merchants know how to do 
good business on our campus.
The physical space that the 
credit card vendors choose pre
sents further problems for stu
dents. They position themselves 
at the corner of two of the busiest 
sidewalks on the campus, near 
the clock in front of Doherty Hall. 
That area of campus is far too 
busy on any given afternoon to 
have these representatives set up, 
making the space even more im
passable.
If we are to have these vendors 
on our campus, they need to be 
made aware that it is indeed our 
campus, and that the students 
that live and work here should 
only have to interact with them if 
they want to. As it stands right 
now, the disrespectful represen
tatives are a nuisance, and the 
problem must be dealt with.
ight now there is something 
going on at this campus that 
many of you may not know 
about, but is actually quite a 
problem. You see, the admin
istration is, for all intents and 
purposes, trying to get rid of the frater
nities.
As usual, many may say, Who cares? 
After all, whats the fra
ternity system but a 
bunch of elitist jerks, 
right?
Well, other than the 
fact that such a claim is 
completely false, there 
is also the fact that the 
fraternities provide a 
number of social and 
charitable functions to 
the campus community.
The fraternity system at CMU is about 
as old as the school. Many of the cur
rently active houses have been here more 
than 75 years and have^a-huge number 
of alumni (I am one).
It has long been a major part of the 
campus social life. Buggy was originally 
a competition between fraternities, as 
was booth. To get rid of the fraternities 
would have a seriously detrimental ef
fect upon the University community.
So you may ask, Well how exactly are 
they getting rid of them? Its actually 
rather simple, yet insidious. They are
pricing them out of existence. Fraterni
ties originally were founded (back in the 
early years of our nation) as a means by 
which college-age men could group to
gether to enable the costs and responsi
bilities of day-to-day existence to be 
handled more easily through the pool
ing of resources. Dorms didnt exist back 
then: you had to go it alone or join a 
fraternity. Fraternities provided both 
shelter and sustenance, as well as social 
activities.
Thus, the fraternity system has al
ways managed to provide a means of 
economical living for those who join. The 
University is trying to eliminate this. 
The simple truth is that when I first
"... there is something going on at this 
campus that many of you may not know 
about, but is actually quite a problem. 
You see, the administration is ... trying 
to get rid of the fraternities."
joined a fraternity, you could pay for 
dues and rent and still come out ahead of 
living in a dorm.
Of course, you had to spend your own 
time on upkeep of the building, but that 
was just part of the deal and was under
stood as one of the reasons you saved 
money.
Back then the rent on one of the houses 
was about $56,000 per year. A few years 
back, the University saw a cash cow and 
decided to milk it for all it was worth.
Also, considering their burning desire structures, 
for more dorm space and the relative
waste of space presented by the frater
nity quadrangle, they can clear some 
needed campus real estate by making 
rent so high that they effectively drive 
the fraternities off campus.
The University also gets the added 
benefit of removing what they probably 
view as a near uncontrollable faction of 
students. Down with independence and 
free thinking.
Fraternity rent (per house) is now 
$110,000 per year. How about that? A 
100 percent increase in eight years. I 
didnt notice consumer goods doing that, 
did you? In fact, if you calculate the 
amount of floor area, and divide the rent 
into that number, you can get a figure of 
rental cost per square 
foot, which is the nor
mal means of pricing in 
professional real estate.
A rough calculation 
shows that the houses 
are being charged about 
$15 per square foot per 
year.
You can get an office
______________ in the financial district
of downtown Pittsburgh 
for that, and you dont do your own 
maintenance in that case. To give you an 
idea of how this compares to local apart
ments, Ive-made an estimate for my 
own which comes in around $8 per square 
foot year, and I dont live in a cheap 
neighborhood.
Does this sound as ridiculous to you as 
it does to me? Lets look at some other 
things. The houses currently inhabited 
by the fraternities are fairly old struc
tures. They are also quite old temporary

Freshman responds to new freedom
Rebecca Fribush
When I was 
younger, I read lots 
of stories that fea
tured big blue mon
strosities; i.e. drag
ons, sea monsters, or 
whatever else could 
be counted on to reliably scare small children. Little did I know that one day Id 
find myself living in a big blue monstrosity. After my first 
month at CMU, I have come to the sad but inescapable 
conclusion that the school aims to bury its freshmen in the 
most putrid colors imaginable. The evidence is every
where. Lovely Donner Hall. The T-shirt, yellow enough to 
attract every bee in Pittsburgh, that we were given the day 
we arrived. The fluorescent sherbet in Highlander. (Im 
convinced that its radioactive. Theres no other way it 
could have gotten to be that color. So if you ever pass 
Highlander at night and see 
something glowing, dont 
say I didnt warn you.) It all 
land of makes you wonder 
whats going on at a school 
whose official color is sup
posed to be a nice, tasteful 
plaid.
Unnaturally colored 
buildings, clothing, and des
sert products are some of 
the most, uh, noticeable 
things Ive come across at 
CMU, but by no means do 
they dominate my impres
sion of the school. As a mat
ter of fact, the longer Ive 
been here, the more Ive seen 
to make me think Ill really 
be at home here.
It started with the weeklong Orientation marathon.
There I found myself face to face with dozens of relentlessly 
peppy Orientation counselors, for whom nothing was more 
important than making sure the class of2000 was properly 
enthused. Seeing that CMU inspires that much spirit and 
dedication in its upperclassmen was certainly comforting 
to me. The Orientation activities were also supposed to 
foster spirit and camaraderie between freshmen, and thats
exactly what they did. Well, yes, Ill admit that I got to 
know my classmates better while griping about some of the 
activities (Let me get this straightwe have to wear these 
stupid name tags every day?) than by actually participat
ing in them. But as long as youve gotten to the desired end, 
why worry about the means it took to get there?
Another thing Ive noticed about CMU is that the inde
pendence is astounding. I can finally do all the wild and 
rebellious things my mother-warned me about. You know, 
eating cookies after Ive brushed my teeth for the night, 
putting off all of my homework until the last conceivable 
moment, even wearing white shoes after Labor Day. Gee, Id 
better be careful, or Ill end up running completely out of 
control.
Yet my Carnegie Mellon experience has been about much 
more than my solitary path to self-destruction. Ive discov
ered that theres always someone around to talk to. Or, if 
you prefer, to distract you from working. At the risk of
________sounding like the brochures that
piled up in my mailbox last year, 
Carnegie Mellon is also a great place 
to meet all kinds of people.
Ive erased any lingering notions 
of engineering or computer science 
students as pocket-protector-wear
ing, graphing-calculator-clutching 
nerds, and as a history major, Im 
sure Ive challenged some miscon
ceptions about the typical humani
ties student.
As for the academic side of things, 
its great to have professors who 
know so much about what theyre 
teaching. I have no choice but to be 
in awe of anyone who not only 
knows enough about a subject to 
soliliquize about it for three 50- 
minute stretches a week, but who 
also volunteers to do this in front of 
a classroom filled to the brim with 
sweaty, irritable, sleep-deprived young people. In short, I 
really like Carnegie Mellon. I think I could definitely get 
used to it here. It would take something much worse than 
a vat full of radioactive sherbet to convince me otherwise.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 September 1996
Economics may lead to destruction of fraternities
STEPANEK, from page 4
I have talked to alumni from 
the era when the old houses were 
tom down, and they recall being 
assured that these new buildings 
were going to be replaced soon 
enough (considering the shoddy 
construction, it would have been 
a nice idea.)
.Well these temporary struc
tures have been here for more 
than 25 years, and I would has
ten to point out that buildings 
that poorly made dont appreci
ate in value.
Lets look at the option of re
placing them.
Using information from the 
Mean Square Foot Cost Guide 
(17th edition) and doing the math 
for the area of a fraternity house, 
one could build such a structure 
(and a much nicer one I imagine, 
but just about anything would be 
nicer) for around $715,000. To 
finance this with a 30 year mort
gage you would pay $63,000 per 
year. Add in about $3,500 a year 
for the heating, which the Uni
versity covers in the lease (mind 
you, this is the market value from 
the gas company, not for CMU, 
which runs its own steam plant 
to efficiently heat the buildings 
and save money). Then add in the 
minimal phone service to each of 
the rooms (say $12 a month, but 
it may be lower since CMU pays 
for so many phones at once) for 
another $3,500. According to the 
lease, another $2,000 is budgeted 
per year to go into a capital im
provement fund. Now lets throw 
in maybe $5,000 a year for any
thing Ive missed (physical plant 
work, lighting the Quad, etc.). 
OK, we now have a total of 
$77,000 per year. Also keep in 
mind this is the cost for a brandnew house, not one that is 25 
years old.
Thats still a good bit cheaper 
than the $110,000 we pay cur
rently.
It would appear that theyre 
pocketing at least $30,000 a year 
per house in profit from a group 
of people they are already milk
ing for all they are worth in tu
ition.
So are they even ashamed of 
this? A friend of mine confronted 
Dean Allison, the Greek Advisor 
for Student Life, on the subject of 
rent. I believe his reaction was 
Why shouldnt CMU charge as 
much rent as we can get? Boy, 
thats really understanding of 
them all.
The way things are now, rent in 
a fraternity is higher than that of 
a standard double in a dorm, and 
the members still have to do the 
upkeep themselves (there is a 
token amount of cleaning by 
physical plant, but this is rare 
and, shall we say, unenthusiastic). This is even when they are 
managing substandard mainte
nance. The hot water in one house 
is sporadic at best, and the mess 
caused by bursting water pipes 
two years ago in another house 
has still to be repaired. Its really 
quite amazing that the fraternity 
members have managed to stick 
it out this far.
What can be done about this 
situation?
Well, the fraternities could all 
move off campus. This would 
cause problems to botfi'the Uni
versity and the houses. Rush 
would be complicated, because 
freshman would have to find the 
off-campus residences.
Also, Pittsburgh has some 
pretty restrictive zoning laws in 
areas, which would make having 
a fraternity house difficult. The 
University would suffer in that 
the main social scene of the cam
pus would move away.
This would both carve a huge 
chunk out of CMUs already no
toriously weak social life, and 
cause more people to have to drive 
to and from social functions. In 
this age of everyone and their 
cousin being held liable in drunk 
driving accidents, I can hardly 
imagine they want that.
In fact, Ive had a direct experi
ence in the dangers of people shut
tling to parties. One of the broth
ers in my house died in a car
accident returning from a party 
at Pitt. Does CMU want to see a 
lot more of this?
I hate to say it, but litigation is 
probably the fraternity systems 
only recourse (perhaps a class 
action?) CMU apparently doesnt 
give a damn what the Greeks 
may say, but theyll damn well 
pay attention to what a lawyer 
says.
If you had a lawyer research 
the Pennsylvania laws pertain
ing to the rights of leassees, I 
would guess there are ways to 
protect their rights. I really dont 
want to see such a thing happen, 
but if CMU continues its relent
less drive to eliminate the Greek 
system, it will have to be decided 
by a judge.

and privledge to witness this in person, 
and those who havent I know youll 
understand: What the hell is up with 
those weird dudes out in front of Baker?
Those guy's who show up on campus 
in full-out medieval garb and beat the 
crap out of each other with ass-kicking 
weapons?
Are they even allowed to be here? Do 
they need a permit? What drives a hu
man being to do this? Dont you have 
anything better to do on a Sunday? 
(And Im not saying watching football is 
a better option. Im actually saying its 
a worse one. Hell, I give the Knights of 
the Round Table some credit, theyre at 
least creative.) So, there are guys who 
are beating each other up outside right 
now: Just be careful!
Luckily, as I passed them, I saw a 
good friend of mine who was having 
Auto-Trauma, a Drama Department 
acting exercise, in which one has to tell 
their life story, theatrical, for a half 
hour to 45 minutes.
any other season is bad. They all have 
their ups and downs, but what we prefer 
is part of what makes us what we are.
While I was sitting with Kelly, my 
roommate was at our apartment with 
his new lady friend, both bundled up on 
our floor-couch, readingbooks we bought 
this morning after breakfast at 
EatnPark, the place for smiles.
I asked him why the window was 
closed. Its cold, Motherf#cker. (Isnt it 
great that I can put a # instead of a u, 
and still get it published? Modem jour*- 
nalistic technical wonders.)
But he and Christie are both from the 
South, so they need to hibernate earlier. 
We northerners frolick in it longer.
And then, after I said goodbye to Kelly, 
I saw Slanty Girl, which always makes 
me happy, so then I easily walked by the 
Knights in White Satin back to the li
brary where I could write my article in 
peace.
Now, back to the main point: Why 
CMU Scares Me A Lot, by D. Garrett 
Howe.This is where it gets freaky. This 
is the real meat of it.

Writer supports gay marriage
dji
Matt Ball
There recently has been a great deal of 
attention given to the issue of gays and 
lesbians. Senators and congressmen (many 
twice divorced or more) are making cer
tain that we live in a society where mar
riage is based on procreation, not love, 
respect, and commitment.
Homosexuals have it rough in this soci
ety. From personal to professional to legal, 
there is a tremendous prejudice against 
people who do not conform to societys 
narrow preference of who should love 
whom.
It is unlikely that a gay couple would 
frivolously request a public marriage in a 
world where they are threatened with loss 
of friends andfamily, jobs, and civil liber
ties if they openly express their affection 
for their lover. Any request for respect for 
their basic human rights (including legal 
recognition of the marital bond) is greeted 
with horror, fury, and ridicule, not unlike 
the reactions to the uppity minorities 
who wanted freedom and the right to vote.
I find myself completely unable to com
prehend any of this irrational and base
less prejudice and hatred towards a per
son on the basis of what they do in the 
privacy of their own bedroom with another 
consenting adult.
During the course of a day, I do research, 
meet with my colleagues, write letters to 
my friends, discuss various issues of the 
day, and sometimes cook for. different 
people. How any of this is affected by what 
I do in the privacy of my own bedroom at 
night  whether it is making love with a 
man or woman or myself, praying to J esus/ 
Mohammed/Buddha or painting my toe
nails, wearing womens clothing or writ
ing a novel  I cannot begin to imagine.
Sex with my lover is very compelling. 
When making love, nothing but my spouse 
matters. I am not thinking about what 
Jesus said, or anything in the Bible. I am 
not considering what society says, nor the 
future of the species. For whatever reason,
I am attracted to this person, this certain 
look, smile, personality... and set of geni
tals. This qualified attraction  I dont 
and havent felt this way for anyone with 
another set of genitals  is not a matter 
of choice and says nothing about me as a 
person. Nothing about this attraction has 
anything to do with how I interact with 
other people.
The relationships I have known be
tween members of the same sex have 
been ones of deep commitment and con
sideration. Rather than being deviant 
and degrading, these couples have been 
models of love and devotion. While I was 
expected to have a girlfriend (and was 
questioned and prodded when I didnt), 
the connection between my homosexual 
friends was not the thing to do. With 
fears of losing friends, family, and jobs, to 
be openly gay was not a decision they 
entered into lightly.
What is the root of societys revulsion of 
homosexual relationships? It cannot be 
anything practical.
Women have more reason to be fright
ened of a straight male than any man has 
reason to be frightened of a gay male. 
Personally, I am more wary of straight 
males, for despite the paranoid stereo
types, I havent met a gay man given to 
macho displays or random acts of vio
lence.
From a pragmatic standpoint alone, it 
would be advantageous to promote a ho
mosexual lifestyle.
Many, if not most, of the problems that 
face the world can be traced to overpopu
lation, which can be cured if a popula
tion is largely paired with people of the 
same sex.
Yet homophobia remains the last bas
tion of naked, high-sounding, smallminded prejudice and hatred in society 
today.
Like the Nazis and KKK members of 
the past, these intolerant, ignorant judges 
wrap themselves in some grand god-given 
morality and build up their pathetic selves 
up by tearing down others.
We are all degraded in the process.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 September 1996h
Writer ponders underground secrets
SECRETS,page 5
Question #1: What in bejesus is really 
going on down in the depths of CMU? 
Think of all those secret buildings down 
by IT that no one is ever seen entering or 
leaving.
In fact, one of the buildings is reputed 
to house the car that may one day ride 
on the surface of Mars, according to the 
stock campus tour.
Well, if theyre building things that 
drive on other planets, what else are 
those folks building?
We know the Univer
sity gets major funding 
from the federal govern
ment and NASA, and it is 
my belief that the Uni
versity may produce items 
that go boom in the night.
A couple years ago, a 
bunch of west coast CMU 
alumni protested their 
alma mater by refusing to 
participate in fund rais
ing because they believed 
the school was building 
bombs. Bombs! Things 
that blow up and kill 
people.
You know about the 
Oklahoma City bombing, 
the Unabomer, and the 
Olympic bombing. They 
were all done by ama
teurs, with stuff that was 
found in a basement. We 
may not be terrorists, but 
we sure have a great amount of technol
ogy at our fingertips to create a lot more 
trouble.
If, in fact, CMU is contracted to pro
duce such material, we may not be blow
ing up daycare centers in Oklahoma, 
but we may be aidingin the governments 
raids on entire cities in Iraq.
All because Saddam attempted to 
blow up two of our planes.
Not that Im supporting the actions of 
 Saddam, Im certainly not, but you know 
what, we could just threaten him.
I can say quite confidently that wed 
win. Were bigger, stronger, and have 
The Bomb. I think weve already shown 
him enough of what we can do, and a 
polite threat might just work.
Last year, I was dating a girl who told 
me a story that convinced me there was 
more to CMU than I ever imagined. 
(And I believe her, because she didnt 
have that good a sense of humor to want 
to make up a story up like this.)
One night, when she was a junior, she 
and a friend had gone to see a movie on
Simona Lo/Art Co-Editor
campus and thought that itd be cool to 
walk down and see what went on in 
those buildings down the hill late on a 
Saturday night. They were strolling/ 
snooping around, looking in windows 
and trying doors, when out of nowhere, 
this dude in a black suit and tie grabbed 
my girlfriend and quietly but firmly 
asked her what she was doing there.
She replied, in real fear, that they jor. 
were just walking home, and that they He enjoys running from others and 
went to CMU and that they didnt know welcomes any responsible replies to his 
they were doing anything wrong and  column.
Please dont kill us.
He let go of her, said Fine, and told 
her to leave immediately.
He then disappeared as quickly as he 
had appeared. Whoever it was that 
grabbed them and spoke to them was 
not a CMU cop.
If it was a CMU cop, he would have 
weighed over 250 pounds and scream
ing at her with lots of flashing lights in 
a Yinzer accent.
This guy came, whispered, threat
ened, and left. It was all pretty shady, 
and it may have just been the 
result of an overactive imagi
nation. But I think theres 
more going on here at CMU 
than we know, and sometimes 
what we do know is even worse.
I feel like Im in that movie 
Cloak and Dagger right now.
You remember that one? 
With Dabney Colman and 
Henry Thomas, the kid from 
E.T. ? Maybe as soon as I start 
bringing this kind of stuff up, 
the government will start a 
file on me.
Ill have a history, and Ill 
be watched. Theyll have a big 
file on me that has my headshots and fingerprints on little 
cards. Thatd be cool. Think 
about it: The FBI and CIA are 
all over this place. You dont 
think they build crazy stuff 
without security, do you? 
Theyll figure out where I 
live, who I call, and what I eat. Then I 
will disappear ... without a trace. All 
theyll find is my comb.and one shoe. 
Wow. Dont forget me when Im gone, 
and remember: the truth is in Panther 
Hollow, by the railroad tracks where it 
was dropped by escaping alien robots.

Editor's Notebook
I entered CMU last year without 
ever using email, never seeing a UNIX 
computer, or even surfing the Internet. 
Believe it or not, I was a complete and 
utter computer illiterate fool. Within 
a week, I became a pro. Let me restate 
that: I was an obsessed pro. Carnegie 
Mellon introduced me to the online 
world and made sure that every as
pect of my life revolved around it.
My assignments were on the web; 
professors announcements appeared 
on bboards. If I was meeting someone 
for lunch, I was told to email them, 
instead of calling. It seemed that if, for 
some reason computers would cease to 
exist, so would this school.
For this reason, it boggles my mind 
that registration is not done on-line.
For a school that does not believe in 
phone calls or paperwork in almost 
any aspect, it seems a bit odd that we 
still have to truck our RAD forms to 
our advisors, then to every depart
ment, then back to our advisor, then to 
the HUB, et cetera, et cetera.
I would think that as advanced as 
this school seems to be with electronic 
communication, we can extend it to 
allow students the convenience of reg
istering online.
At University of Georgia, a state 
school, they already have an online 
registration process. Students simply 
go to their computers, mark the classes 
they want, and it appears on their 
schedule. If the class they want is 
already full, its unavailable to them. 
At the University of Florida, not only 
is it on-line, but students can register 
by phone, simply punching in the 
classes they are trying to register for.
Why is the supposed leader of com
puter technology so behind other col
leges in this relatively simple pro
cess?
Why do students have to camp out 
to get into 18-240? That, to me, seems 
almost funny. Maybe camping out for 
classes can create bonds with other 
students. Maybe it will make the thrill 
of actually getting into the class just 
that much sweeter. Maybe having to 
go to every department to get signa
tures forces students who otherwise 
would never get the chance to meet 
some of the department people.
Maybe there are some good reasons 
for keeping a traditional registration 
policy. I admit that walking 30 min
utes to visit a neighbor back in the 
olden days was probably a greater 
deed than calling, but that never 
stopped people from actually buying 
telephones, did it?
Now dont get me wrong, this is 
probably the only thing I have to com
plain about when it comes to this 
school. But, come on: we are in college 
and have other things to worry about 
than running from one end of college 
to another to be placed on a waiting 
list.
It is possible that students today 
are just way too wrapped up in this 
whole computer frenzy and not spend
ing enough time getting to know 
people at a more personal level. But 
why ruin a good thing? (Just kidding 
about that last remark; I just dont 
want to keep walking up three flights 
of stairs at Baker to sign up for every 
Psych class for the next two and a half 
years).

Bad movies, Kung-Fu actors characterize writers summer vacation
Tom Harper
Well, dear readers, Ive been 
regaling you/yunz/yall/ya/you 
guys about my incredible sum
mer vacation. '
This week Ill give you the lowdown on my incredible social life, 
which is only incredible because 
its so mundane.
My social life during the year 
isnt really that bad. Whenever I 
get done with my work, my usual 
routine is either going to the video 
arcade, watching network televi
sion, carousing some of the AMS 
graffiti boards, or watching mov
ies at the Beehive.
During the summer, most days 
in my incredible social life went 
like this:
1) Go home from the library.
2) Nap.
3) Go to either Prim anti Bros, 
or the Beehive. Wish people would 
talk to me. Wish doesnt come 
true.
Swear never to try to better my 
social position because nothing I 
try works.
4) Nap again. Wake up at 2:30
am because I slept so much after 
I came home.
5) Sleep just enough to be dis
gusted when the alarm rings. Go 
to the library. Swear to try and 
better my social position by any 
means possible, only to chicken 
out by step 6.
6) Repeat process.
Okay, so my social life wasnt 
incredible.
In fact it was as dull as the 
directions on a bottle of Pert. I 
was so close to actually caving in 
to the beer commercials direc
tive to use their product to en
hance it. (Yes, I was desperate.)
Just hear me out here ... all 
those people in beer commercials 
grow to be 50 feet tall and race 
across the Rocky Mountains, bowl 
across the Rocky Mountains, have 
superior athletic ability and can 
demonstrate it by leaping over 
the bar and using mops as a pole 
vault, have tons of women by their 
side, can make hilarious prank 
calls ... the only downside is the 
constant harassment by pen
guins.
That and the hundreds of empty 
calories. They dont call it a beer 
belly for nothing!
Anyway, after I quit wishing 
for a fictional beer-enhanced so
cial life, I just decided to make do 
with what I had. I then subscribed
to every graffiti board on AMS. ?! 
went to Toronto. I found some-of 
those chatrooms on the Internet. 
I read a lot. And in my spare 
time, I disdained the preekies.
Thingwas, I was actually happy 
then.
There really werent that many 
people here to begin with, but 
now that there are and I actually 
want to go out and do some things, 
Im stuck because of financial 
constraints or lack of energy.
 And no, my lack of energy is not 
because of beer.
Another neat aspect of my in
credible social life was not caring 
about the Olympics in any way, 
shape, or form.
This forced me to try and steer 
any conversation I was in away 
from the Olympics, except to talk 
about crass commercialism, 
which a great many Olympic con
versations ended on whether I 
tried to steer it that way or not.
And, if you believe the media, 
people who ate at McDonalds 
and beer drinkers excelled in ev
ery event.
I am still wondering what it 
takes to be christened The Offi
cial so-and-so of the Olympics. 
Is there an auction for this? What 
if CMU wanted to be christened 
The Official University of the 
Olympics? Im sure we could afford it next time the games come 
around, though I dont want to be 
affiliated with any Olympics ex
cept those with the Jamaican 
bobsled team in it.
I am sure Id take at least the 
silver for Cynicism.
In retrospect, my social life 
during this summer was a bit 
dull, but it did lead to an enjoy
able new hobby  watching re
ally bad movies. Its cheap and 
entertaining.
I managed to catch Barb Wire 
at the Beehive, and it was so bad 
it led to an increased apprecia
tion for le mal cinma .
This genre is in no way limited 
to Pamela Anderson Lee flicks. 
(As an aside, me and a few other 
people are waiting for the day 
when Mrs. Lee appears in a Star
Trek film, with her first lines 
being, I am a symbiotic life form: 
one carbon-based, two siliconebased.)
Most films stereotyped as 
Kung-Fu flicks fall into this cat
egory, especially the dubbed ones. 
Im sure the Chinese equivalent 
of You use dirty tricks! Youll 
never know my name! sounds a 
lot more threatening. Most of the 
effect is lost in translation. Its 
sad, really.
That, and It poisoned me. I 
cannot use Kung Fu for three 
months.
What Id really like to see some
time this year is a Bad-Movie 
Marathon. We could have such 
classics as Hell Comes To 
Frogtown, Super Ninjas,Motel 
Hell, Citizen Kane, and any film
featuring Bruce Lee knock-offs 
named something like Bruce Le1 
or Bruce Li.

Injuries plague pro baseballs stars
The Hot Corner
by Matt Cuccaro
Each year, injuries force many 
ballplayers to miss playing time. This 
year is certainly no exception; however, 
1996 has seen a dramatic rise in the 
number of severe injuries and afflictions. 
Approximately 10 former Most Valuable 
Player and Cy Young Award winners 
have missed significant amounts of time, 
and many players seasons are over. Here 
are a few noteworthy cases of players who 
have been forced off the field for extended 
durations.
David Cone: In early May, Cone was 
diagnosed with a career-threatening 
aneurysm in his right shoulder and 
was unsure whether he would ever pitch 
again. But successful surgery and a 
productive rehabilitation program al
lowed him to return September 2, when 
he pitched seven no-hit innings against 
the Oakland As. Cone has gone 2-1 
since returning and is determined to 
lead New York to the division champi
onship and beyond.
Mark McGwire: Although currently 
playing and leading the American League
in home runs (with 48 through Friday), 
for the second consecutive year McGwire 
will not break Roger Maris single-season 
home run record of 61 because of injury. 
In 1995 he hit 39 homers in only 317 at 
bats (which projects to 62 HR in 500 AB), 
and with 30 games missed in 1996 he will 
once again fall shy of the record.
Randy Johnson: The Mariners 
have had so many all-star-caliber play
ers hurt this season; its remarkable 
that they are still in playoff conten
tion. Edgar Martinez, Ken Griffey Jr., 
Alex Rodriguez, and Jay Buhner have 
all missed playing time, but Seattles 
most significant loss has been that of 
Randy Johnson. Known as the Big 
Unit, the 1995 Cy Young Award 
winners season is over, due to a bulg
ing disc in his back.
Kirby Puckett: In what was by far 
the most unfortunate case in all of 
baseball, Puckett was forced to retire 
this season because of retinal damage 
in his right eye caused by glaucoma. 
The Twins and their fans honored the 
most popular player in franchise his
tory with a ceremony in the Metrodome 
on September 7.
The celebration glorified Pucketts 
achievements both on and off the 
field during his illustrious 13-year 
career, including two World Series 
championships and community work 
with children.
Trivia: In the strike-shortened sea
son of 1994, who were the two league 
leaders in home runs?
Sammy Sosa: When Sosas hand was 
broken in late August, he was leading 
both the National League in home runs 
and the Cubs in their quest for a division 
championship. With the injury, though, 
Sosas season and Chicagos hopes of 
reaching the playoffs are over.
cause of an Achilles tendon injury suffered 
earlier in the season.
Matt Williams: Williams, who missed 
almost half of 1995 due to injury, had been 
one of the few bright spots for the Giants 
this year until he was forced to undergo 
season-ending surgery on his right shoul
der. When he went on the disabled list 
August 5, he was batting .302 with 22 
home runs and 85 runs batted in.
Brett Butler: For four days, the re 
turn of Butler was perhaps the most 
inspiring story in baseball. In May, doc
tors discovered cancer in one of his ton
sils, and he was forced to spend several 
months recovering from surgery and ra
diation treatments. Butler, considering 
retirement, was uncertain when or if he 
would ever play baseball again.
Miraculously, on September 6 he re
turned to the Dodger lineup and scored 
the winning run in a 21 victory over 
Pittsburgh. But less than a week later, 
he fractured his hand attempting a bunt 
and will probably miss the remainder of 
the season!
Butlers return provided a much' 
needed emotional boost for the 
Lasorda-less Dodgers; it will be inter
esting to see what effect his injury will 
have on the team.
Trivia Answer: In 1994, Ken Griffey 
Simona Lo/Tartan Art Co-Editor Jrled the American League with 40 
home runs, while Matt Williams led the 
National League with 43 dingers.Tony Gwynn: The Padres six-time 
batting champion is hitting .352 but most 
likely will not have enough plate appear
ances to qualify for the batting title beMatt Cuccaro wishes he was Rartdy

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 September 1996
Johnson creates ferocious Dolphins
4th and 26
by Steve Charnoubi
CAMP SHULA, July 24, 1995 
Its a nice warm South Florida 
unmer day outside. Perfect con
ditions for practice. The Miami 
Dolphins are out in the field, 
happy and relaxed. Players seem 
laid-back and calm. Theyre not 
putting their best into it,' but 
theyre enjoyingthe good weather 
and theyre trying not to kill them
selves, because, hell, its only prefeasonpractice. Theyll save their 
fijodies for the regular season.
6 And the fans there are also con
tent. Happy to watch the DolRjh'ins practice, but slightly bored 
until theres a great hit or a great 
Ifttch, and then they cheer. They 
Iso cheer whenever the great 
Don Shula emerges from his hid
ing place behind a pack of offen
sive linemen and looks up at the 
stands and smiles to all the fans 
who are shouting for him. 
r i Its as if Florida still hasnt come 
fiown off their 1972 undefeated 
Championship season high, and 
Don Shula is just the forever re
minder of how glorious the Dol
phins past has been, 
i:! yje 11. Wayne Huizenga wanted 
toilook towards the future. Hed 
gone through a handful of sea
sons content that the Dolphins 
were always up there, but never 
feally surprised that they never 
made it all the way. Now he wants 
;o win, not just to make a cameo 
appearance in the playoffs and 
disappear like last year, but to 
win it all. He wants a Super Bowl 
viing of his own. So he brought in 
the hottest free-agent in themarket, coach Jimmy .Johnson, 
straight from FOX studios.
: | CAMP JIMMY, July 24, 1996 
The rain is pouring down from 
the remnants of the just-passed 
hurricane. Perfect conditions for 
practice. The players are all 
muddy and wet, practice is noth
ing but misery for them now. But 
through this torture, they have 
locked up in their brains the one 
thought thats motivating them 
all, from Dan Marino to some 
rookie who probably wont make
the team. Ive got to fight with 
110 percent. No mistakes. I play 
to win at all costs, except losing. 
I will punish my opponent. And if 
I dont, coach Jimmy Johnson is 
going to kick my ass.
And the fans cheer. They cheer 
through all of it. They finally see 
new hope for the Miami Dolphins. 
They can now look away from the 
past and towards th e future. They 
see a coach who has won big else
where. The team he created and 
built up is still winning Super 
Bowls. They see a coach who is 
willing to run around with the 
players and yell at them all. And 
they see the reactions of the play
ers to the coach. Never have they 
seen the players 
practice with so 
much ferocity < 
and kill. Every /; 
hit is a bonejj 
crusher; evIj 
ery pass and jj 
catch is per
fect. Players 
run their 
hearts out, 
and the fans 
love it. ,,
A lot of people \\ 
have dismissed 
the Dolphins 
during the pre 
season as finishing 
everywhere from 
third to fifth, but the 
people in South Florida 
know. They knew all 
along. The idea of Super 
Bowl Champs is very strong 
in their minds. At first the 
talk was in whispers. The Dol
phins could win it all this year, 
they said. But right now, they 
must all be cheering and incred
ibly excited to have a real con
tender in town. The Panthers 
came close, but now it looks to 
them as if the team of the glori
ous past will return and regain 
the Super Bowl trophy for 
Florida. Very similar to the way 
, the city ofDallas felt several years 
ago, when Dallas was making its 
first run in a long time towards 
the Super Bowl.
The Dolphins this season have 
done nothing to prove the critics 
right, and they have done every
thing to bring themselves closer 
to their goal. They are currently 
2-0, having blown out both the 
Cardinals and the Patriots. They 
lead the NFL in rush defense, 
giving up an average of 28.0 yards 
per game. Their overall defense 
ranks fourth, and their overall of
fense ranks 10th. They are first in 
the AFC with eight take-aways, 
partly from Terrell Buckley lead
ing the NFL with three intercep
tions, and first in the AFC in with 
only two give-aways.
defense. And Daryl Gardener 
(first round pick) is starting to 
feel his way through the NFL as 
the Dolphins starting left tackle, 
having already registered a sack.
Dan Marinos role has diminThis team is lead by g^bunch of ished, which is good. Now he
eager rookies, and a few cagey old 
vets. Karim Abdul-Jabbar (third 
round pick) leads a strong rookie 
class thatonce again proves coach 
Jimmy Johnson is an excellent 
draft strategist, and has an in
credible eye for talent. AbdulJabbar is fourth in the AFC in 
rushing yards, and first in the 
NFL with three touchdowns. He 
runs behind multi-talented full
back Stanley Pritchett (fourth 
round pick) who has provided ex
cellent blocking for the running 
game and is leading the 
Dolphins in receptions 
and receiving yards
(seven 
recep
tions for 
90 yards). 
On defense, 
middle-linebacker Zach

can feel more comfortable play
ing, and not be under pressure 
to be the entire Miami Dolphins 
offense, as he was last year. 
Hes playing a Troy Aikmantype role at quarterback, where 
his passing plays are built on 
the foundation of a strong run
ning game. One exception is that 
hes a much better passer than 
Aikman, and he has a lot more 
experience. Hes not expected 
to gain all the little }rards; thats 
the running backs job. Hes ex
pected to come up big when it 
counts, and he has. His 120.8 
quarterback rating on third 
downs is first in the NFL. 
And he has converted six 
out of njne red zone op
portunities (second in the 
AFC) so far this season. 
Coach Jimmy Johnson won two 
Super Bowls with Troy 
Aikman. Imagine what he can 
do with Dan Marino.
If the Super Bowl were to
morrow, Id say the Dolphins 
would be the AFC representa
tive, but its not. Theres still a 
whole season to go through. 
The Dolphins look just like any 
other 2-0 team this year  
their future looks bright, but 
theres a long way to go. Who 
knows, anything can happen 
in the NFL.
Games to see (Week 4): 
San Francisco at 
s Carolina, 1pm: The 
Panthers won last 
year, and theyre 
better this year.
Dallas at Buf
falo, 4 pm: Super 
Bowl XXVII and 
XXVIII rematch.
Miami at Indianapolis, Mon
day Night: The Colts were a 
catch away from the Super Bowl 
last year  both teams are hot 
right now.
Game to miss:
Giants at Jets, 1pm: Pray this 
isnt the televised game.
Steve Charnoubi has visited 
the Dolphins training camp on 
July 24 of the past two years. He 
is not a Dolphins fan, though. 
He just lives in South Florida 
and loves it there.
UC changes CMU athletic policies
UC, from page 12
but we really didnt want to 
block [the room]  the whole 
idea of the University Center 
is to interact. Morosky says 
that the plants will help to 
soften the view, not to block 
it. Also, the department is 
looking into the possibility of 
adding more equipment to add 
to the workout rooms in the 
UC.
Unfortunately, there are 
no plans as yet to add some 
of the extra facilities that 
were included in the origi
nal design of the University 
Center and later cut due to 
budget concerns. The origi
nal design for the UC in
cluded both a walking/jog
ging path, and bleachers in 
the Lord Aquatics Center, 
and structural supports 
were installed for both, to 
possibly add them in later 
projects.
New policies have been en
acted to ensure that the ath
letic facilities of the UC are 
used only by CMU faculty, 
staff, and students. On Sep
tember 9, the new wristband 
policy went into effect. Joan 
Maser, associate director of 
athletics, said the depart
ment was looking for an 
easy way to monitor the fa
cilities without having to 
come up and ask for IDs.
Unlike the Skibo Gymna
sium, which has one main 
door so it is easy to monitor 
who enters the building, the 
University Center has so 
many different doors that it 
is hard to limit the use of 
the facilities to CMU people. 
We tried to come up with an 
easy solution, Maser said.
Under the new policy, 
people who wish to use the 
UC facilities have to go to 
the equipment desk located 
across from Wiegand Gym
nasium and exchange their 
IDs for a yellow wristband. 
Each student is permitted 
to bring one guest. The policy 
does not apply to intramu
ral sports or classes that re
serve space  any super
vised activity does not re
quire a wristband.
Wingen said that students 
should remember that the
UC is your facility to re
main in your control. Ma
ser also said, [The wrist
band policy] is really for 
their own benefit  the fa
cilities are here for them. * 
Because users write down '1 
what facility they are planv 
ning on using when they get ' 
their wristband, the depart: 
ment is planning on charting the usage of the differ
ent facilities.
Along with the other - 
changes, the Athletic De
partment has added several 3 
new people. In addition to  
the two new coaches (David ' 
Belowich, swimming/diving 
and Julie Webb, volleyball), r 
the department has hired -> 
Mike Grzywinski as assis
tant director of intramurals. ' 
Grzywinski will help over
see the UC facilities and man 
the auxiliary Athletic De
partment office in the Uni
versity Center.
The other two new mem
bers of the department are 1 
Joanne Johnson and Inez . 
Ferraco, the co-coordinators 
of aquatics and fitness. . 
Morosky said that the two  
will be a real nice balance 
because Johnson has educa
tion in aquatics with a fit
ness background, while 
Ferraco has a strong fitness 
education with aquatics - 
background.
They will help teach new ' 
classes and lead workshops,  
while working on any addi- 
tional future projects that 
the department brings in. 
Johnson and Ferraco have 
offices in the UC  they and

No need to fear  
underdogs are here
The Pigskin Pundit
by Chris Cannon
| Theres no need to fear, the 
caped canine would begin. Unj derdog is here, he. always said,
! finishing the Underdog motto. 
With an up, up, and away, week 
I after week our hero would rise to 
the challenge of fighting evil foes 
much stronger, smarter, and 
sometimes sillier than himself.
How similar, you must think, 
to college football.
College coaches and commenitors will weekly (weakly) whine 
about David and Goliath 
matchups (which I never under
stand, because I thought David 
beat Goliath, didnt he?)  like 
Ohio States 70-7 slaughtering of 
Rice last week  saying such 
spectacles have no place in col
lege football. But if Rice (enroll
ment less than 2,000) never 
played Texas (enrollment greater 
I than 22,000), we wouldnt have 
had last years upset of biblical 
proportions.
| What is it that makes us cheer 
i for the lesser team? Rooting for 
' the underdog is not without pre
cedence in history. From early 
Scandinavian mythology that cre
ated the Norse Gods and Giants 
(and then prayed to the weaker 
group), air the way up to last 
i seasons Northwestern Wildcats, 
everybody loves an underdog.
Perhaps its the sense of identi
fication with the little guy that 
makes us yearn for the upset. 
This may well be, but this same 
theory didnt lead Falling Down 
to any box office success. I believe 
that it is a combination of gratifi, Satiori"andloyalty * that 
motivates and rewards 
the true underdog, 
fan. For others, it is' 
to kick mighty cham
pions when theyre 
down and have fallen to 
the average team.
While some of us ap 
plaud the over 
achievers, laud the 
nameless defense,
and simply cheer wildly when 
the walk-on wide-out makes a 
catch, others are just there to 
jump on the bandwagon. 
Theres a fine line (which many 
of us cross, week by week) be
tween the faithful and fairweather fan. Do you sing the 
rah-rahs of State U. from kickoff until the likely bitter, disap
pointing defeat or do you bob 
and weave under the banners 
of teams that are hot?
Did you point and laugh at 
Notre Dame when it seemed 
they couldnt win a game? Were 
you once a Colorado fan, then 
not and now youre back again? 
Did you root for Oregon  was 
the Rose Bowl the reason, did 
you follow Northwestern only 
late last season? Was your team 
the Crimson Tide, after they 
tanned Miamis hide? How long 
have you held the Cornhuskers 
dear? Just entering your sec
ond year?
Lets hear it for the under
dogs of the year: Iowa State, 
who plays six teams currently 
ranked, including their last four 
games; North Carolina, a ris
ing power, who already beat 
Syracuse in the Carrier dome; 
our own Pittsburgh plays five 
ranked opponents, all on the 
road.
Game of the week: #1 Ne
braska at #21 Arizona State, 9 
pm. The Cornhuskers were 
shaky on offense in their first 
game. Meanwhile, the Sundevils offense showed just 
how quickly the scoreboard can 
light up. Unfortunately, so did 
the Sundevil defense. If 
Nebraskas offense falters 
again, look for them to be 
shocked (and shucked) in the 
Sun State.
First runner up: #4 Florida 
at #2 Tennessee, 3:30 pm. 
Peyton  proves his passing 
power.
Second runner up: #10 
Notre Dame at #8 Texas, noon. 
Cue that Irish fight song.

& Chris Ad uka it is
With play in the inaugural 
World Cup of hockey at an end, 
one cant help but become over
joyed at the prospect of the new 
NHL season. This off-season has 
been a busy one, with many im
portant acquisitions and trades. 
This years Eastern Conference 
strength will come from a core of 
seven play-off regulars. That last 
spot is always won in the last 
game ... who will stand up to the 
Avalanche this year?
The Philadelphia Flyers won 
the East last year and should do 
so again. They possess one of the 
elite corps of forwards in the 
league, including Eric Lindros, 
Jon Leclair, Dale Hawerchuk, 
Mikael Renberg, and Rod 
Brindamour. Their defense is 
somewhat thin, and the sopho
mores slumped last year. If Ron 
Hextall cant return to his old 
form, the Flyers will have to trade 
for help or hope Dominique 
Roussel finally steps up. The Fly
ers elimination by the Panthers 
last year was just a fluke; look for 
them to go to the Finals.
Pittsburgh should have won the 
East last year, but they choked in 
the final game, leaving Philly to 
inherit the number one seed. The 
Penguins have an excellent group 
of forwards and are adding even 
more power to their core of men 
by signing free agents Shawn 
Antoski and Dan Quinn from 
Philly. Mario Lemieux claims that 
this will be his last year, so you 
know he will be leading his team 
with a little more determination. 
The goaltending is solid, if not 
spectacular. With a little defenser* 
Pittsburgh has another legiti
mate shot at the Cup.
The Rangers have acquired 
Wayne Gretzky in an attempt to 
recapture the glory days of the 
Edmonton Oilers. It wont work. 
Gretzky is over the hill. He will 
provide about 70 or 80 points, but 
nothing approaching his earlier 
numbers. His main contribution 
will be wisdom and leadership. 
The Rangers went on a rampage 
this summer, dumping such no
tables as Jarri Kurri and Pat 
Verbeek, while trying to stay 
within their own exorbitant sal
ary cap. If Brian Leetch returns 
to his Conn Smythe form of 1994, 
Alexi Kovalev finally proves he
should be mentioned in the 
same sentence as Pavel Bure 
and Alexander Molgilny, and 
Mike Richter has another in
credible year, the Rangers could 
be a dark horse.
What? No rats on the ice this 
year? Hopefully, the new NHL 
rule on items tossed on the ice 
during a game will not deter 
rabid rat fans from their crazy 
ways. The Florida Panthers 
shocked the NHL last season, 
jumping out to an incredible 
start and continuing to win until 
the Cup finals. With a solid de
fense, the re-signing of Ray 
Sheppard for leadership, the
a disgrace! Dont look for it to 
happen again, however. Scott 
Stevens will guide his blue line 
troops in a more disciplined man
ner this year, which Phil Housleys 
departure makes even easier. Look 
for Scott Nieder-mayer to become 
restless in this system (and per
haps a mid-season trade). The 
Devils lost some offensive punch 
in Housley and Stephane Richer, 
but they still have one of the top 
three goalies in the league. Dont 
bet on them going past the second 
round, however.
The Capitals will continue to 
frustrate their fans and their em
phatic coach, Jim Schoenfeld.
awarding of coach DougMcLean 
with a three-year contract, and 
John Vanbiesbrouck standing 
on his head, the Panthers may 
make a stab at the Cup.
The Devils missed the playoffs 
last year as defending Stanley 
Cup champions  only the sec
ond team in history to do so. What
Edith Pong/Tartan Art Staff
Housley is already being thought 
of as their savior on defense. The 
Caps have a decent roster of play
ers in Joe Juneau, Peter Bondra, 
Housley, and goalie Jim Carey, 
but have continually under
achieved. Schoenfeld will have to 
put life into this organization, 
because it needs so much more.
In doing a count of Team USA:-? 
World Cup players, you will note.'j 
that seven members are frorn; 
Massachusetts. None of them,';- 
however, play for the Bruins 
Boston may well miss their first"; 
playoff berth in 30 years if they>: 
cant solidify strong first and sec-V

four goaltenders last season, they*-; 
seem to have settled on Bill: 
Ranford, who may have been the;:; 
sole man keeping them in theii; 
fifth-seeded position last season.;:'; 
With Cam Neely retiring because;;'; 
of hip complications, Adam Oates 
is left as the only true workhorse!  
on the squad at forward. Hope- 
fully with the re-signing of proven-' 
performers Ted Donato and Steve*;; 
Heinz, and the drafting of five'-';, 
defensemen, someone will stepjtj 
up to fill big holes. Someone has;;: 
to put the Team back into Boston.!;i
As for the Buffalo Sabres, lets:'; 
hope that Dominick Hassek can;-;.;, 
drink before games, because hisI'C 
reflexes are better when hes' 
drunk. The Canadiens are still.? 
beating their heads into the wall-- ^ 
for letting Patrick Roy go to that';- 
pesky Avalanche team. The Whale;  
should be thanking God that they: 
still have a place to play; look for;; J 
them to be in Oklahoma before V

By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Junior Staff writer
On Saturday, the mens soc
cer team beat conference oppo
nent Case Western Reserve by 
an impressive 6-1 margin. The 
victory came on the heels of 
their Wednesday loss to Wash
ington & Jefferson by a score 
of 2-1. Showing its determina
tion, the young team outplayed 
Case from start to finish and
several scoring opportunities. 
Midway through the first half, 
CMU scored again. Junior for
ward Jason Buelow made a run 
into the Case penalty box and 
received the ball on a through 
pass. The CWRU goalie came out 
of the net to make a challenge for 
the ball. In the process, he col
lided with Buelow, who was able 
to get a shot off on net that was 
deflected in by Case defenders.
With less than three minutes

moved its record to 3-2.
- 'It was a good way to start the 
conference, said coach Nick 
Gaudioso. The kids are play
ing better.
From the beginning, the Tar
tans controlled the ball and 
began to create opportunities. 
It took less than seven min
utes for the team to score its 
first goal. Sophomore forward 
Harry Ulrich worked the ball 
down the left wing. After los
ing his defender, he sent a cross 
into the penalty box, which the 
Case goalie misplayed. Sophombre midfielder Alex Benetti 
had made a run into the box 
and found himself in perfect 
position to put the ball in the 
back of the net.
.The Tartans controlled play 
for most of the first half, earning
left in the half, it looked like 
CMU would carry a 2-0 lead 
into halftime. However, Case 
came back at the Tartans right 
off the restart. Case senior 
Adam Deeb took a throw-in on 
the right, 20 yards from the 
CMU endline. The throw went 
into the box and was headed 
back out by CMU defenders. 
Deeb then volleyed the ball into 
the far left corner, just out of 
reach of freshman CMU goalie 
Ben Kartzman. This didnt dis
courage the Tartans, though, 
who brought the ball back into 
Case territory. With less than 
30 seconds left, Buelow scored 
again, this time on a looping 
half volley from 25 yards out, 
giving back CMU its two goal 
lead going into halftime.
The second half started out with
another flourish of offensive 
play from CMU. Right from 
the start they were pushing 
the ball more aggressively into 
Case territory. Senior mid
fielder Suraj Naik, CMUs cap
tain, began making more plays 
from his defensive position into 
the midfield. Again it took less 
than seven minutes for CMU 
to score. Naik moved the ball 
past several Case players in 
the midfield to within 20 yards 
of the goal. He then left the 
ball to Buelow. Buelow passed 
off to sophomore midfielder 
Dan Brody, who put a hard, 
low shot into the far corner of 
the net.
With a 4-1 lead, the Tar
tans seemed to take over the 
game. Case Western played 
flat and uninspired. Due to 
the pressure they were un
der, Case often had nine of 
their players within 35 yards 
of their own goal.
With the despondent Case 
team pushed back on its heels, 
CMU was able to rotate in some 
of its younger players. This was 
especially important due to the 
youth of the team. We have a 
lot of freshmen that have a lot 
to learn, said Gaudioso. The 
playing time given to them 
should go a long way to ensuring 
the teams future.
The team continued to control 
play throughout the half. With 
17 minutes left, freshman 
midfielder John Petrillo. picked 
up the ball from outside the pen
alty box and put a low shot past 
the Case goalkeeper in the net.
Petrillo would score again, this 
time with seven minutes left, on 
a penalty kick that was awarded 
after freshman midfielder Sharif 
Siddiqui was tripped in the pen
alty box.
The teams performance as a 
whole was impressive, and 
Kartzman turned in a solid per
formance in goal.
The team plays against Al
legheny on Wednesday, but will 
not make another appearance 
at home until October 9.
Volleyball improves to 4-5
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Trtan Staffwriter
A second weekend of tournament play has 
improved the Carnegie Mellon womens volley
ball team to a 4-5 record. The tourney, held at 
Gettysburg College on Friday and Saturday, 
had CMU facing Keene State, Scranton Col
lege, Lycoming College, Gettysburg, and West
ern Maryland.
The Lady Tartans opened up strong against 
Keene State, winning that match in four sets. 
The next team they faced that afternoon was 
Scranton College, who squeaked by the Tar
tans in five sets. Each match was played to the 
best of five sets.
Coach Julie Webb encouraged the team on 
their second day of play to keep up a strong 
defense. They faltered in the morning, losing to 
Jjycoming in a heartbreaker of five sets. Then 
they faced the host team Gettysburg, who 
$macked the Tartans in three straight.
The team knew they had to dig in for the last 
match of the tourney against Western Maryland. Reports were that the opposition was 
strong, but the CMU team was not deterred. 
They played Western Maryland for four sets, 
winning the last set and setting the team ablaze 
with pride over the hard-earned victory.
We are definitely getting better as we go 
along, said captain and senior setter Sarah 
Pacocha. We have improved since last year, no 
doubt.
Sophomore outside hitter Tawnya Sunderland 
agreed. The team is a big improvement from 
last year, she said. Sunderland also noted that 
the play of the freshman continued to be very 
strong. Ashley (Kinsey, outside hitter) and 
Beth (Sekowski, right side hitter) played espe
cially well. All the freshmen worked hard.
When asked about their current 4-5 stand
ings, both women were positive. We ended the 
tournament on a good note, with a win, said 
Sunderland. Pacocha added that the Chicago 
Round Robin in late September is probably the 
most important time.
The Tartans play away at Grove City, with 
Marietta and Oberlin, next Saturday at 11 am.

The Tartans suffered another loss this weekend 
against Case Western Reserve University, who 
last season ended the Tartans playoff hopes with 
a much-unexpected 3-0 win. The Spartans de
feated the Tartans 16-0 this season. The Tartans 
hadnt been shut out in 23 years (1972-1995), but 
in their past three games, they have been shut out 
in two of three meetings. Both shutouts were 
against Case Western (last seasons final game and 
this seasons second game).
The Tartan offense struggled again, gaining a 
mere 68 yards rushing, one less than last weeks 
total, and 90 total passing yards for a total of 158 
yards for the game. Senior quarterback Dave 
Soltysik completed only seven of 24 passes, with no 
touchdowns and four interceptions.
The Tartan running game has been stuffed for 
the past two games. The Tartan offensive line 
hasnt been creating the holes for an effective 
running game to move the ball down the field.
Even though the rushing yards were quite lo\V; 
the main problem seems to lie in the lack of third* 
down conversions. The Tartans were two of 13 oi 
third-down conversions against the Spartans. Foi 
the season the Tartans are four for 30 in this areal 
The defense held the Spartans to 16 points and 
seemed to be the only part of the Tartan machine 
that was working. But even 16 points is a lot to give 
up. We could even do better defensively, coadi 
Richard Lackner said. We need an overall team 
step-up.
A common feeling from the players is one of lad 
of emotion on the field. We need to play with more 
intensity and emotion, said senior defensive bad 
Albie Fletcher. We also have to start creating 
some big plays on special teams.
Though the past two games seem a bleak starf; 
some players still have faith in the Tartans, even 
with the toughest part of their schedule coming up! 
Junior Jody Rogish said,  I feel that well rebound 
from our first two losses and have a successful year.
The team hosts Grove City College at home 
this Saturday at 7 pm.
CWRU, Tartans scoreless

After a 2-0 win against Allegheny 
and a 0-0 tie with Case Western

Get wide, get wide, come on!

coach Ann Haggerty yelled dur
ing the first half of Saturdays 
game against Case Western Re
serve University.
But even though the women on 
the field responded with a num
ber of shots on Cases goal and 
several well-executed defense 
moves, they werent able to break 
a 0-0 tie.
The game went into double 
overtime, lasting an extra 30 min
utes. The team managed to keep 
its defense tight, with a save by 
freshman backfielder Jocelyn 
Poliak after goalkeeper Lindsay 
Smith was tripped up blocking a 
corner kick.
We had a lot of conference over
time games last year, and we lost 
all of them 10, said Haggerty. 
So none of us really wanted to go 
into overtime. But we feel good 
that we played hard through the 
whole entire game ... we handled 
the overtime well.
For most 
of the game, 
the ball 
stayed in 
the midfield 
as the two 
teams 
punted 
back and 
forth. Yet 
even with 
strong off e n s i v e 
drives by se
nior 
midfielder 
Mae 
Hogan, junior forward Lauren 
deRosset, and 
junior forward 
Kim Umeda, 
the team 
wasnt able to 
coordinate it
self well 
enough to 
score.
Our defen
sive pressure 
was pretty 
strong and 
[Case] didnt 
have any 
chances to get
said Haggerty. I think oui 
counter-attacking, was pretty 
strong; we just have to learn to 
put the ball in the net. .
A small but enthusiastic crowd 
of fans attended the game, ini 
eluding two people who spent the 
game chanting the Carnegie fightj 
song, and displaying the TAR
TANS written across their stom
achs. Come on, ladies! they, 
yelled across the field at the end 
of the first half. Its getting cold! 
We need a score!
Despite the teams difficulties' 
scoring against Case, the seasoni? 
off to a strong start. Last Wednes
day, the Tartans won an away 
game over Allegheny in a 2-0 vic
tory, with three shots orijl 
Alleghenys goal and seven goalie 
saves.
The team is home against Grove 
City on Tuesday and away against 
the University of Chicago on Sat

Athletic Department institutes new policies, plans construction
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
 With the grand opening of the new 
University Center, the athletic depart
ment now has four facilities at its 
disposal  Skibo Gymnasium, theUC, 
Gesling Stadium, and. the tennis 
courts.
. The athletic facilities in the UC were 
designed to be used for purely recre
ational purposes  the only varsity 
sport that will regularly use space in 
the UC is the swimming and diving 
team  and the Athletic Department 
is-implementing a number of changes 
to deal with the new space.
Although a large number of recre
ational athletics will be held in the
UC, Skibo Gymnasium will still be 
heavily used. The athletic coach and 
IM offices will remain in Skibo. The 
majority of martial arts will still take 
place in Thistle Hall. Most of the physi
cal education classes, with the excep
tion of aquatic and racquetball classes, 
will be in Skibo. The Body Shop, free 
weights, and a limited number of 
aerobics classes will remain where they 
are, as well.
In the past, especially during the 
winter months, intramural and var
sity sports often took up all of the gym 
space. Now, with the University Cen
ter, the Athletic Department is plan
ning events so that there will usually 
be an open gym.
Assistant Athletics Director for Fa
cilities Tony Wingen said, More than 
90 percent of the time there [will be] a 
free open gym available. Mike 
Mastroianni, director of intramural 
sports, said that they are planning so 
that students can go to at least one of 
the gyms and recreate.
Future renovations of the Skibo 
Gymnasium are in the works to fur
ther improve the campus athletic fa
cilities. The first phase, renovation of 
the locker rooms, was completed two 
years ago, butlastyears plannedrenovations were delayed due to the finish
ing work on the UC. Now, the depart
ment is looking to put the renovations 
back on schedule by combining the 
second and third phases of construc
tion. Phase two involved changing the
lower entrance of the building into the 
main door, turning the small gym into 
office space, and redoing the old office 
spaces. The third phase includes plans 
to turn the current office areas into 
meeting and public rooms, as well as a 
concessions area for varsity events. 
These changes are slated for comple
tion in March.
Future construction also includes 
renovation of Thistle Hall. The plan is 
to turn Thistle into a regulation-size 
basketball court and to lower the floor 
so that it is level with the main gym. 
Tied in with this will be the conver
sion of the old pool into an all-purpose 
room. The department is looking into 
filling in the pool and covering it with 
a multi-purpose flooring, to be used
for hockey as well as IM and club 
sports. Also in the future, there are 
plans to do a cosmetic overhaul of the 
main gym, and continually update the 
facilities in the free-weight room.
There are also changes in the works 
for the University Center. The depart
ment has heard from some students, 
faculty, and staff who are uncomfort
able with the glass front of the aerobic 
room. To address this concern, large 
potted plants, ferns, and latticework 
have been ordered to be placed in front 
of the workout rooms.
Donna Morosky, the director of fit
ness and health, said that several other 
options were considered, including 
frosting the glass or installing blinds,

By ANNEMARIE DEVINE
Tartan Staffwriter
Just about every program in which 
CMU helps the community surround
ing it falls under the umbrella of the 
Center for University Outreach 
(CUO), and now there is a new person 
holding that umbrella aloft. Follow
ing the retirement of founding direc
tor Ted Fenton, Linda Flower was 
named director of CUO and Joe Mertz 
will serve as associate director.
Flower is an English professor and 
co-founded the Community Literacy 
Center on the citys North Side. Her 
project within CUO involves taking 
CMU students from the Community 
Literacy and Intercultural Interpre
tation class to the Literacy Center to 
have discussions with inner-city teens. 
The class helps the teens produce a 
.document to express themselves to 
the community about concerns like 
respect, violence and teen issues.
Joe Mertz is a post-doctoral fellow 
_ in the Center for Innovation in Learn: ing. He has worked closely with the 
East End Cooperative Ministry, serv
ing on the board of directors. He helped 
| set up a computer lab for the tutoring 
program and with the CMU/Goodwill 
computer recycling program.
According to Flower, CUO can be 
divided into three parts. [CUO] is an 
umbrella for energetic faculty who gen

erate projects and it brings resources, 
technology, and ideas to the commu
nity, she said. CUO creates a net
work of ideas and faculty who might 
not have known each other.
It also supports CMU students who 
are playing a role in education in the 
city. CMU students are active in such
projects as the East End tutoring 
project, Role Models, and the Commu
nity Literacy Center.
The third dimension Flower would 
like to bring to CUO is an opportunity 
for CMU students to have a chance, 
through coursework to get involved in 
intercultural collaboration. Our hope
is that we can help faculty who want to 
bring community perspectives into 
their courses and start dialogues with 
people in the community [such as the 
dialogues at the CLC], she said.
Although she said, Being an ad
ministrator was not my goal in life; I 
love to do research, Flower was a
natural choice for the new director 
when Fenton left. I wasnt looking for 
an administrative position, but when 
you argue strongly for a principle or 
value and someone asks you to do 
something about it, you cant say aw, 
shucks, not me.  Her responsibility 
now is to outline the future of CUO 
and its projects.
Mertz sees CUO projects as win-win 
situations. The community has is
sues they are interested in and need 
assistance. [Professors can] use real 
problems, not made-up problems in 
the classroom, he said.
He will work to be an ambassador to the 
community and to talk to faculty who 
might be interested in projects. By the 
end of the academic year, Mertz hopes to 
have a web page that describes all of the 
projects and will serve as a resource to 
interested faculty and students.
Both say that there is no average CMU 
student who gets involved with CUO 
projects.
People are really eager to not stay 
confined to this academic world. They 
are interested in education, in getting 
outside the campus community, to do it 
not as a spectator, but as a participant, 
said Flower.
Mertz described what CMU students 
get out of the projects.
You see that what youre learning has 
some value beyond yourself and the 
course and the grade, said Flower.Student receives Merck fellowship for research

Visiting writer speaks to students and faculty
By JULEE WHITE
Features Assistant Editor
A seemingly unexceptional stop at 
a gas station led to the beginnings of 
one authors creative writing career. 
A man at a New Hampshire gas 
station caught writer Ernest 
Heberts interest enough to give way 
to five books and 14 years of work 
about a little town in New Hamp
shire, he said. Last Friday, Hebert 
kicked off this years Adamson Vis
iting Writers Series, by reading from 
his novel Live Free or Die.
I [find] his writing to contain 
gorgeous language, vivid characters, 
and a broad canvas, said Jane 
Berstein, associate professor of En
glish. Bernstein was first introduced 
to Heberts writing through his novel, 
The Dogs of March.. She made sure 
that he was included in the Adamson 
Visiting Writers Series as one of 
eight authors to visit CMU this year.
Ernest Heberts interest in writ

How does honest conversation 
sound? How about guaranteed coffee 
and chocolate? Best of all, how does 
the phrase non-judgmental sharing strike 
you? If that sounds good, 
so will Coffee Talk, a 
weekly discussion group 
held by the Womens Cen
ter. This past Wednesday 
marked the first Coffee 
Talk of the semester and 
was held in the Womens Center lo
cated in the Margaret Morrison Plaza.
Coffee Talk is a forum to discuss a 
lot of issues common to a diverse group 
of students, women and men, Womens 
Center regulars and non-regulars, 
said Terry Lumish, one of the coordi
nators of Coffee Talk. It was initiated 
by Suzanne Paddock about a year ago
and is, Lumish said, a good way to 
bring people to the center who may not 
otherwise come. This year she, along 
with Janel Hamner, will be holding 
the meetings every other Wednesday.
The topic last Wednesday was Why
discuss gender issues? and the group 
numbered about 15. While the desig
nated topic started the conversation 
other issues were brought up  such 
as first-time sex, the way our society 
views female sexuality, and personal 
theories on why gender roles have 
evolved the way they have. There was 
no formal structure and everyone was
willing to give others a chance to speak. :j, 
Many of those participating were not 
members of the Womens Center col
lective and those who do belong were 
very friendly and non-threatening. It 
seemed as though every style of feminism was represented.

Society fails to give working women deserved respect
CRACKING THE MYTH
By Christy Hipchen
Sometimes I wonder if a wife can win. 
The role is so complex, with so many 
conflicting pressures, that it can seem 
impossible to satisfy all demands. If a 
women pours herself into her work, she 
fears her family may suffer. If she does 
not work, she will be just a housewife. 
These perceptions, along with the fact 
that most women still earn less money 
than men, pressure wives to leave themselues out of the equation.
Societal construction of the role of. the 
wife is both defined, because standards 
and demands exist, and ill-defined, be. cause these standards are confusing and 
affect women differently according to 
class and position in society.
Hillary Rodham Clintons term as 
First Lady provides a timely case study 
'of the prevailing construction of the 
wife role. It is important to note that
this example pertains largely to the 
middle and upper classes, because work
ing class women face the same prob
lems, but have even fewer options.
Some say that Mrs. Clinton has revo
lutionized the position of First Lady. 
Its true that the role will never be the 
same. But theres more to it. Mrs. 
Clintons term has unearthed how many 
people feel about working, assertive 
wives, and the verdict is quite disturb
ing. People feel the need 
to plaster their negative 
feelings about Mrs.
Clinton everywhere, from 
bumperstickers to (bad) 
jokes on late-night televi
sion. Now, we have ad
vanced to the point where 
a woman holding a high 
position, as, say, a lawyer 
or healthcare reformer, is no longer 
blatantly controversial or disallowed. 
So whats the big fuss? The title is the 
key, because it fits her into a proscribed 
role as the wife of an important man. In 
the public view, she is first and fore
most a wife, so perceptions about wives 
linger behind perceptions about her.
Attacks on Mrs. Clinton indicate that 
ideas about success are highly gendered. 
Men are applauded for being educated,
committed, assertive, and well-employed. Transpose these qualities onto 
a woman, a wife, and many sneer that 
the woman is a troublemaker, a bitch. 
Its ridiculous that these qualities are 
not seen as assets to Mrs. Clinton be
cause she is a woman and a wife.
A man with her education and experi
ence would not be expected to sit back 
and keep quiet. Former first ladies were 
not subject to this kind of scrutiny, but
Mrs. Clinton's term [as first lady] has 
unearthed what many people feel about 
working, assertive wives, and the verdict 
is quite disturbing.
they did not project assertiveness or break 
the benign, nurturing, wife-as-social-accessory mold.
They did projectnurturance, style, and 
social grace, which have been the defin
ing features of important mens wives, 
who are not expected to be important 
themselves. Obviously there is a sort of 
conservative consensus about what a 
wifes role is, because departure from the 
traditional mold in favor of aggressive
job commitment has caused quite a stir.
Also lurking behind all this negativ
ity is the idea that women work for 
different reasons than men. The rea
sons that men work are obvious. They 
are expected to derive their self-fulfillment and financial well-being from 
work. But, even today there is this idea 
that a working woman is a novelty. She 
may enjoy it, and its nice for her, but 
surely she will stop when she has kids
----------------------------- or no longer
needs to work. 
Thats just how its 
done, especially in 
the upper middle 
class. If she does 
work, a dispropor
tionate amount of
----------------------------- the domestic duties will still be 
hers, leaving her with complicated and 
conflicting demands.
Womens personal concerns are not 
taken into consideration, especially 
when family economics become part of 
the picture. If the woman is making 
less than the man, and, even though its 
the 90s she most likely will, why would 
she venture outside domestic duties if 
its not financially necessary?
This question would not exist if
womens motivations for working were 
seen as the same as mens motiva
tions, which contain a definite selffulfillment, desire-for-success compo
nent. It is true that it was not finan
cially necessary for Mrs. Clinton to 
take on duties that extended beyond 
her traditional role.
The fact that it has also turned out 
to be socially unacceptable is very reI 
vealing about peoples ideas concern
ing womens work.
Jokes and negative commentary 
about political figures will always 
abound. It is not the existence of, but 
the nature of Hillary bashing that 
makes it so disturbing and dangerous. 
Her behavior would not be considered 
controversial in a husband, but her 
title marks her as a wife.
Bashing Mrs. Clinton is bashing 
strong, assertive wives everywhere 
who struggle to integrate the wife role 
into their lives. If people object to Mrs. 
Clintons politics, fine.
But societys persistent objections 
to her lifestyle serve as an unsettling 
affirmation that wives still have a sub
ordinate role.

sional writing major.
Drop in rankings disappoint student
ON MY WAY OUT
By Eric Salzman
My dad is threatening to ask for 
a refund. When I entered this 
University over three years ago, it 
was ranked 19th in the nation; 
now it is ranked 28th. Not good. I 
could harp on the administration 
for letting me down, for not main
taining it standards. I could harp 
on the students for not doing their 
part, for letting the school, as well 
as me, down. However, I dontthink 
Id be right.
Rather, Id like to point out a few 
little things about some of the uni
versities that have bumped CMU 
out of the top 25. Lets begin with 
the highest ranked university that 
sucks monkey sweat: Notre Dame. 
Excuse me, but even the movie 
sucked. Rudy, please, its a nice 
cause and all  but not top 25 
material. Notre Dame obviously 
received the sympathy/popularity 
vote. Personally, I didnt know that 
overall yardage was one of the 
qualifying factors.
Somehow, the University of 
Michigan made U.S. News and 
WorldReports list oftop 25 Ameri
can universities. Of course, who 
am I to argue that a school that 
produces such fine scholars as 
Chris Webber who chucks his stud
ies for an NBA contract, isnt dedi
cated to academic excellence? 
What were those guys called? The 
Fab five? The dreaming warriors? 
Webbers major, what was that 
again? Math, right? Folks, Michi
gan is the land that brings us 
Euchre, a watered down version of 
the card game bridge, because 
thinking about all of the rules in 
bridge is just a little too stressful. 
Dont dare show those Michiganese 
a chess board; they might scream.
Looking down to the bottom of
the top 25 list, I noticed the name 
Wake Forest University. This was 
the moment I knew that terrorists 
had broken into U.S. News head
quarters and changed the pages. 
During a semester abroad, I once 
lived with a guy who goes to Wake 
Forest. Nice guy. Smart guy. 
Wouldnt last two weeks at CMU. 
Do you know what that guy could 
handle at CMU? Intro to Physics 
for non-majors.
students who can play well with 
their balls are qualified to be listed 
as one of the top 25 universities in 
America.
So heres my advice on the situ
ation. Dont whine and complain. 
Dontsay that youve beenletdown. 
Fix it. Make it better. Kick some 
Georgetown ass (ooh, another bas
ketball school in the top 25, whod 
athunkit). U. S. News has changed 
its standards. That change is why
And he was a physics major at 
Wake Forest.
Wake Forest, for those who dont 
know, is another one of those re
ally good basketball schools; yet 
again proving that schools with
Simona Lo/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
CMU has dropped out of the top 
25, not because of a decrease in the 
quality of this University.
Where do we need to improve in 
order to move back up the list? 
Well, CMU could be more selec
tive and take only students from 
the top 10 percent of their high 
school class. That would help as it 
is one of the categories where we 
fare the worst. Just a show of hands 
 how many people wouldnt be 
here if that idea was CMU policy? 
Now, of those people, how may are 
doing quite well? Plenty of you. 
Know why? Because CMU looks 
past GPAs when selecting qual
ity painters, actors, designers, 
computer scientists, and so on.
Hmm, why do that? Ill tell 
you why. Because you dont need 
an A in 10th grade U.S. His
tory to paint like Andy Warhol, 
act like Holly Hunter, or pro
gram like some really good pro
grammer.
U.S. News has given us the 
shaft. Fine. Bend over, pluck it 
out, and move on. Send me your 
Euchre players, your Webbers, 
your Rudies, and your Tufts stu
dents (anyone who has ever 
been to Tufts will know that it 
automatically sucks because the 
campus is on a steep hill, mak
ing movement a pain  I dont 
like hills). If they can last a 
semester at CMU, then keep us 
out of the top 25. Otherwise 
U.S. News, kiss my 28th na
tionally ranked ass.
Eric Salzman is a senior. A 
senior. Got it? Its up to you to 
make his soon-to-be alma mater 
most excellent. Peace.

Writing series kicks off
MoD9ou yet, 6SAxrH
has won awards from New England Press 
International.
Hebert soon became interested in creative 
writing, although he never expected it to 
become the main focus of his career. [I didnt 
think that] a description about a guy that I 
saw at a gas station would expand into five 
novels and 14 years of work, he said.
His critically acclaimed novel, The Dogs of 
March, won a citation from the Ernest' 
Hemingway Foundation. Hebert read from 
the last book in this series about a small town 
in New England, Live Free or Die.
This book (Live Free or Die) is the story of
 see the series as contributing to 
the extra-curricular activits of the 
writing program, but also as 
reaching out to the wider campus 
community.

the CMU Creative Writing Program
star-crossed lovers, doomed because they come 
from different worlds, said Hebert. Its the 
story of Lilith, the daughter of the richest 
man in town, and her lover Frederick, who 
makes his living as a trash collector.
One of the most intriguing aspects of 
Heberts reading is that different portions 
are written through the point of view of vary
ing characters, thus presenting a more com
plete knowledge of the characters and the
setting. My only regret in writing this book is 
in naming the main female character Lilith, 
because soon after this book, Cheers came out 
with one of their main characters named 
Lilith, he said.
Hebert describes his latest novel, Mad Boys, 
which breaks away from the other five in 
content, as a virtual reality Huckleberry 
Finn. Hebert teaches English and creative 
writing at Dartmouth College in Hanover, 
N.H.
The Visiting Writers Series, which will cel
ebrate its 30th anniversary next year, is an 
extension of the Adamson Student Writing 
Awards program and is supported by the 
Adamson Fund.
James Daniels, director of 
Carnegie Mellons creative 
writing program said, We 
select writers whose work is 
known to our faculty, is 
widely published, and dem
onstrates the excellence that 
we want our students ex
posed to.
In addition to the evening

as contributing to the extra-curricular activi
ties of the writing program, but also as reach
ing out to the wider campus community, said 
Daniels.

Gonzalez, whose October 17 appearance will 
be co-sponsored by the Office of Student Af

Citadel needs money to fund co-education
CHARLESTON, S.C., Sept. 13 
(AP)  The Citadel needs as 
much as $300,000 in additional 
state money this year to cover 
the cost of bringing women into 
its formerly all-male corps of 
cadets, interim President 
Clifton Poole said Friday.
The money is needed to pay 
for everything from printing 
new recruiting materials to hir
ing female staffers, as a federal 
judge has approved in the
State lawmakers had ear
lier earmarked $1.4 million for 
a womens leadership program 
at Converse College designed 
as an alternative to female ca
dets at The Citadel. That 
money was never spent.
The Citadel has already 
spent $53,000 to buy recruit
ing lists with the names of po
tential women cadets.
You said Do it. You said 
the admissions policy is genYou said the admissions policy is genderneutral, and so I put it in gear right away." 
) Clifton Poole, president of The Citadel
schools plan, Poole said.
I guess what Im telling you 
is either you guys give me the 
money or I have to go to jail, 
Poole said to laughter from sev
eral board members.
Poole said he spoke with Fred 
Carter, executive director of the 
state Budget and Control Board, 
who plans to visit the college and 
seethe needs first-hand. Poole said 
that Carter told him the funding 
shouldnt be a problem if it costs 
less than $300,000.
der-neutral, and so I put it in 
gear right away, Poole told 
the. board.
The college changed its all
male policy in June, two days 
after the United States Su
preme Court ruled the all-male 
admissions policy at Virginia 
Military Institute was uncon
stitutional.
Four female cadets enrolled 
at The Citadel this summer.
Were receiving nothing but 
accolades, for quickly moving
to admit women, Poole saifl. 
VMI has not yet made a deci
sion on whether to admit 
women or go private.
Were looking very good. VMI 
is being trashed  by bein^ 
trashed I mean the media is oft 
it like a dog pulling down a sick 
deer at the end of the herd, he 
said.
He said the VMI board may 
well make the same decision as 
The Citadel.
At this point, 
VMI is being taken 
to task very se
verely. And the 
standard by which 
VMI is being judged 
against is us. We
------------- need to bask in these
few moments of 
peace and glory, Poole said.
Board Chairman Jimmy 
Jones also likes the peace that 
has returned after journalists 
flocked to campus to cover the 
admission of the women.
It is so, so wonderful to m^ 
to walk across campus and not 
see all the TV trucks and stuff. 
Gentlemen, our focus from this^ 
point forward is on the class-1 
room, back on the parade| 
ground and out of the press;! 
Jones said.

in that he gained a great deal of experience through 
the internship. He said, I learned applications 
development for a large company. There was al
ways interaction between project team members 
at Merck.
One nice thing about the internship was the 
professional environment, he added. There were 
120 interns from Nigeria to Costa Rica to South 
Korea. I like the social interaction. The feedback I 
got from such excellent peers was an overwhelm
ing experience.
Stark also benefited from the professional semi
nars held for all interns. The topics that were 
covered included time management, site engi
neering, drug development processes, and drug 
manufacturing processes.
Though the job became frustrating at times, 
Stark insists it was rewarding. He said, I would 
encourage students to apply. Its a great place to be 
an intern even if you apply outside of the fellow
ship.

Amos moves concert audience
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
On Saturday the 14th, Tori Amos played for a 
nearly sold o ut crowd at the A. J. Palumbo Center. 
Amos is on tour promoting her new album. Boys 
ForPele.
Amos first became popular in 1991 with her 
album Little Earthquakes. This album dealt with 
her demons in a breathy style that mixed heart 
wrenching lyrics with piano mastery. In 1994 she 
released her second al
bum, Under the Pink, 
which was a huge com
mercial success. The 
current album, re
leased in spring of 
1996, takes Amoss 
style and extends it by 
adding an element of 
harpsichord.
Tori opened with the 
quiet yet intense 
Horses, the first 
track of the new al
bum. Some groups 
concert performances 
are considered good if 
they replicate the 
songs on their albums. With Amos this isnt the 
case  in concert her songs are enhanced by what 
she does differently in them. For example, during 
one song she stopped playing and used the top of a 
piano as a drum set. Also, when she played her 
song, Sweet Dreams, she broke from it and ended 
by singing a few lines fromthe Eurythmics song 
also called Sweet Dreams. Amos isnt content 
with simply reproducing her songs; she adds more 
to them and thus connects with the audience.
However, Amoss variations on her songs doesnt 
mean that shes sloppy. She did a wonderful ver
sion of Talula, from her new album, by playing 
totally in synch with a background drum beat.
The show was incredibly intense, and Amos 
drowned the audience in waves of emotion. The 
mood of the songs ranged from the airy and highly
upbeat Caught a Light Sneeze, to her chilling a 
capella performance of Me and A Gun, which 
recounts her rape, to the intense, angst ridden, 
Precious Things.
In addition to playing her more popular songs, 
Tori also played several of her rarer tracks and did 
several covers. She did a beautiful cover of Love 
Song by The Cure on the harpsichord, and did an 
incredible version of Princes Purple Rain on the 
organ.
The stage was simply decorated yet looked fabu
lous. The only non-in
strumental decoration 
was a triangular pro
jection screen that lit 
up the b ack of the stage 
with colorful patterns.
Tori also enjoys in
teracting with her fans. 
Near the end of the 
show she invited people 
to stand up near the 
stage, saying that 
theyd be welcome, as 
long as youre all nice 
and dont push each 
other.
The show was even 
better because of a 
strong opening performance by guitarist/vocalist 
Josh Clayton-Felt. His songs were a pleasing mix 
of acoustic and electric guitars, combined with 
intriguing introspective lyrics.
Judging from her performance and the energy 
that she displayed on stage, not only is Tori Amos 
incredibly talented, but she also truly enjoys do
ing what she does. In playing her music, she 
shares part of herself with the audience. Also, in 
todays world, where music artists tend to stick to 
one instrument, it is nice to see an artist willing to 
take the risk of learning a new instrument and 
thus expand her music.
The concert was incredible, although there are 
some songs that I wish she had played. However, 
this is to be expected given the depth and quality 
of all of Tori Amoss music.

Art exhibit rises from dead
By BRADLEY W. ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Unassuming. Thats the first term you 
think of when you happen upon Zenith Gal
lery. Situated on the corner of 26th and Sarah 
in the South Side (behind East Carson), Ze
nith is a one-level predominately purple build
ing that houses both the art 
gallery - and a top-notch an
tique shop. Privately run, it 
doesnt seem to get much press, 
though it constantly spotlights 
some of the best local non-installation art.
A Wake: Dead Art by Live 
Artists takes former CMU 
alumni, members of the ex
perimental Brew Haus, and 
other famed local artists on a 
trip down the time-honored 
tradition of the eulogy. While, 
everyone from Rembrandt to 
Duchamp to Warhol has ex
plored this theme, its become 
more of a relaxing exercise for 
many, a chance to reflect on 
their lives up to a point and to 
decide what theyd prefer to 
have said about them.
The gallery itself, being a 
small one-room affair, houses 
approximately 15 pieces and 
is lit by various antique glass 
and crystal chandeliers among 
the white-walled warehouse 
atmosphere. Occupying one 
whole wall is Jon Benders 
mixed-media My Last Breath 
was the Easiest... featuring 
a plaster and ceramic cast fig
ure in repose with a large red 
cloth suggesting a red dragon 
motif. In a mixture of the spiri
tual and the physical, there is 
a common funerary vase be
neath the figure and adorning the wall which 
the figure is mounted to are Warholian fauxanatomy drawings with black tape. The scene 
suggests the release from suffering after a 
long-term illness and is emotionally charged, 
contrasting the calm of the figure with the 
maelstrom of implied viscera.

Scotch N Soda, CMUs venerable stulent-run drama organization, has just 
lamed its gray hair and smart figure: It 
vill turn 70 years old this year, and the 
festivities will be gala.
Founded in 1926, the group went 
through many historical incarnations. 
Originally organized in 1907 as a dra
matic outlet for students, and the first 
musical produced was called All In a 
dormitory, a farcical look at dorm life at 
Carnegie Tech. The organization was 
officially named in 1938, after a series of 
hiatuses caused by WWI. Past Scotch N 
Soda productions include the rock-fantasy, Nemeses, the existential Gods and 
Cats, and Disney-writer Stephen 
Schwartzs Godspell.
Every year since 1947, Scotch N Soda 
has produced an original musical in con
junction with Spring Carnival as well as 
four to six student-directed shows. The 
group also runs an improvisation group 
(No-Parking Players) and a weekly act
ing, writing, and directing workshop 
called Playworks.
The organization is currently plan
ning a Homecoming Retrospective with 
Hollywood mogul Jerry Adler, previous 
Scotch N Soda president and alumnus. 
I cant wait for [everything] to happen. 
It has already been a wonderful experi
ence working with people from depart
ments all over campus and Jerry Adler, 
said Amy Poettinger, a junior architec
ture major and current president of 
Scotch N Soda. More than anything, I
am honored to be the president this year 
and get the opportunity to be the repre
sentative of our organization.
The Retrospective will include song, 
dance, multimedia, and selections from 
past Scotch *N Soda productions. What 
is unusual about this revue is the many 
locations it is being planned: coordina
tors include Adler in Los Angeles, Jesse 
Raimey in the Undergraduate Research 
Office, and as members of Alumni Rela
tions, Student Affairs, and the Scotch 
NSoda board.
I have been very excited, saidPR 
director Sameer Kareem, a junior IM 
major. This provides such a great op
portunity for all of our current members 
to get a chance to meet Scotch N Soda 
alumni, hear about where their lives 
have led them, and learn more about 
how the organization ran in the past. 
This excitement seems to be the norm as 
Homecoming draws closer.
The show will be held in the 
McConomy Auditorium. Members and 
the general student body are invited to 
audition for parts and participate in the 
festivities.
I think its great that Scotch N Soda 
is having a reunion after seven decades, 
because it shows what a wonderful orga
nization Scotch N Soda is, said Lisa 
Marinacci, a senior BHA major and ac
tive member of the organization.
Many of the alumni have expressed 
their Scotch N Soda pride, and I will be 
just as proud, when I graduate in the 
spring, to say that my best memories at 
CMU are the times I spent with Scotch 
N Soda.

Networks start new Fall TV season
ON THE TUBE
dren and is very similar to the little gem 
that precedes it, Dave's World.
Although sitcoms dominate the fall 
lineup (as they do almost every year), 
there are a few notable dramas popping 
up on the networks agendas. X-Files 
creator Chris Carter is contributingMi'Zlennium to Foxs schedule. Millennium, 
which follows an FBI agent who is able 
to see into the minds of violent crimiand Profiler (about a psychologist who 
can recreate violent crimes in her head). 
In other words, NBC will be showing 
their versions of The X-Files andMillennium.
Despite the fact that there have only 
been two successful family dramas this 
decade (Dr. Quinn and, most recently, 
Touched by an Angel), CBS is unleash
ing Promised Land (Tuesdays, 8 pm)
by Ddil Rosenberg na^s ta^e over X-Files Friday at 9 and Early Edition (Saturdays, 9 pm).
After four months of reruns, the new 
television season begins this week with 
a vengeance. Twenty-nine new series 
will bow on the four major networks 
within the next few 
weeks, most of which 
wont last more than a 
year. Amongthepackof 
freshmen, however, 
there are several 
standouts.
Bill Cosbys new 
sitcom, appropriately 
titled Cosby (CBS, Mon
days, 8 pm), reunites the 
comedian with Phylicia 
Rashad, who played his 
wife on one of the big
gest hits of the past de
cade, The Cosby Show.
The series is followed by 
Cheers' Rhea Perlman in 
Pearl, a sitcom about a 
middle-aged widow who 
goes to college. Come 
October, Pearl will move 
to Wednesdays and Ink, 
the new sitcom from fel
low Cheers (and CMU) 
alum Ted Danson, will 
take over the Monday 
berth.
Other 80s sitcom 
stars are returning to 
television this fall as 
well. Family Ties'
Michael J. Fox stars as 
a deputy mayor in Spin 
City (ABC, Tuesdays, 9:30 pm), which is 
being touted as one of the best sitcoms of 
the season. Foxs Ties co-star, Justine 
Bateman, meanwhile, is starring in the 
less popular Men Behaving Badly (NBC, 
Wednesdays, 9:30 pm).
The sitcom that is getting the best 
buzz, however, stars little-known 
comedian Ray Romano and
pm slot, bumping the hit sci-fi series to 
Sundays at 9 pm.
Premiering this week in ER's Thurs
day at 10 pm berth (the hit medical 
drama returns on September 26) is The 
Pretender, a Fugitive-like drama about
The former is an Angel spin-off about a 
poor family that travels across the U.S. 
helping people along the way. The lat
ter, meanwhile, is about a man who gets 
his newspaper one day early and uses the 
knowledge to help people. Corny? You 
bet. Worth watching? 
That remains to be seen.
The dramatic series 
that is earning the most 
raves, however, is a love 
story from the producers 
of thirty something and 
My So-Called Life. ABCs 
Relativity, which pre
views a week from Tues
day before moving to its 
regular Saturday at 10

Basquiat makes it big
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Staffwriter
How long does it take to get famous?
Uh, four years? Six to get rieh.
For Jean-Michael Basquiat, the focus of the 
movie Basquiat, it took less than two.
MlSs  Basquiat 
8aexIste jvHHaSd 3IldSPxH 
Ot,6Sd. faeS,SJ
After some time spent on the streets of New 
York City writing graffiti on public places and 
signing them Samo, he was discovered by a 
writer for Art Forum and brought into the 
forefront of the early 80s art scene. He soon 
became associated with Andy Warhol and other 
important members of the art world.
How do I know all this? I saw the movie. 
Knowing nothing of Basquiat before going 
into it, I now feel I have a sense of the mans 
life and art. The movie comes off as an honest 
and unflinching view of Basquiat from his 
days of living in a cardboard box in New York 
to his meteoric rise to fame.
Jean-Michael Basquiats character is the 
only one we can really identify with, the only 
one who seems real. The many caricatures of 
people in the art circles are greatly amusing, 
especially David Bowies remarkable portrayal
of Andy Warhols wooden demeanor. In fact, 
all the performances in this movie are great 
including the usual suspects youd expect in a 
hip movie (except Bruce Willis and Tim Roth). 
But most remarkable of all is the performance 
of newcomer Jeffrey Wright as Jean-Michael 
Basquiat, who gives us a brush with Basquiats 
madness, emotion, and genius.
First time director and writer Julian 
Schnabel does a brilliant job of bringing 
Basquiat and his world to life in the subtle 
details and emotions imparted to the charac
ters. He should  he was a personal friend of 
Jean-Michael Basquiat and a fellow artist, so 
this movie is able to give a very inside view of 
Basquiat and the world he lived in.
But the most important part of this movie is 
not the performances, but Basquiat himself. 
He was an artist who spoke of the streets, who 
produced, as it is said in the film, art from the 
gutter. He had a rough and turbulent life, 
filled with hard drugs and doubt. He chased 
the self-destructive life as an ideal, and raised 
the fast lifestyle to romantic heights. But he 
never became selfish or mean. Everything in 
his life was transitory, to be painted on, ad
mired, and then given away.
But dont take my word for it, Im just some 
shmuck at a keyboard who saw a movie he 
enjoyed. Check the movie out yourself, or bet
ter yet, check his art out, and read a biography 
on Basquiat and then head over to the Manor 
theater to see the movie. Theres no reason 
you should see some ignorant art completely 
ignorant.

The drawing, that of an old high-contrast cem
etery, focuses on the off-center foreground of a

two hands caressing each other. The mixed

Though you 
may not know 
the artist, the 
juxtaposition 
of the three ^ 
pieces instills the viewer with a somber sense of 
loss, as if an emotional common ground truly 
does exist, and that the loss of a loved one is 
truly universal.
Bruno has found the frequency that this uni
versality resides on.
Contrary to the teachings of post-modernism 
(which we seem to finally be moving away from, 
thank God,) A Wake:... celebrates the human 
figure, be it in the literal translation of Connie 
Merrimans joining of the flesh and vegetation 
in a full-body ceramic cast, or Kate Bazis im
plied nest of her own hair (accompanied by a 
humorous obituary), or Claire Alexanders merg

rope fringe with anatomical features. However 
more disturbing are those pieces where the 
ures are absent, such as Tracy Harts 
pearing crib, adorned with a simple painting 
what appears to be blood cells and sperm in 
ordered dance.

Its refreshing to see pieces which the artists

The eulogies, obituaries, and death

Joel, Crow, Gypsy, Mikko, Sam, Eddie, Joanie, 
and the Fonz come to the big screen in this adap

used to love the show when it was on. But it really 
was a time investment: You had to really wanna 
watch it, or you got bored. I liked that one movie 
with Tibby the turtle. That was really funny. And 
all those ones with Godzilla, and the one when the 
kids go up into the alien space ship and the aliens 
are two women (mildly perverse, if you ask me). 
Go see this with that guy who always makes fan 
of the movies he watches. That way the people on 
the screen will beat him to it, and you can laugh at 
him.

Critic hopes new comic series lasts
COMIC BOOK 
CHRONICLES
by Jason Andracki
Vertigo, the DC Comics subdi
vision, has existed for barely five 
years but is already a force in the 
comics industry. In addition to 
the core of DCs mature reader 
titles like Sandman and 
Hellblazer that founded the Ver
tigo line, this imprint has released 
high quality continuing series like 
Books of Magic and a plethora of 
limited series hits such as Vamps. 
Dark Horse is the only company 
that can compare to the diversity 
and quality of Vertigo.
Something terrible happened 
to Vertigo earlier this year. Its 
flagship title, Sandman, ended. 
The creator, Neil Gaiman, de
cided 75 issues was enough. Sure, 
Vertigo would still continue with
out the Master of Dreams, but it 
would be like Marvel without 
Spider-Man. In a brilliant move a 
month after the final issue of 
Sandman, Vertigo launched a
new Death limited series, a se
ries reprinting Sandman from the 
beginning, and a new 
title, The Dreaming.
Gaiman created so 
many compelling sto
ries that they can sup
port an ongoing se
ries.
In The Dreaming,
Morpheus is men
tioned but never ap
pears. The title can
not replace Sandman, 
nor was it intended 
to. Instead we have a 
series set up like Leg
ends of the Dark 
Knight, in which a ro
tating cast of creators 
take turns weaving 
tales about the minor 
characters from the 
Sandman mythos. In 
the first story arc,
Terry LaBan of Cud 
and Peter Snejbjerg 
of Books of Magic tell 
a tale of Cain, Abel,
Lucifer, and a gar
goyle called Goldie.
After years of seeing 
these characters in 
the background with 
little dialogue, they 
are finally being 
fleshed out and given 
some depth. The cur
rent story arc, The Lost Boy, 
features Peter Hogan, a Brit from

2000 A.D., and Steve Parkhouse 
from Invisibles producing a story 
starring Mad Hettie.
The quality one ex
pected from Sand
man is in the pages of 
The Dreaming. Dave 
McKean still provideshis wonderfully 
bizarre covers, and 
the writers, while not 
of Gaimans caliber, 
still write thoughtful 
stories. Sandman 
never had a set art
ist, so the rotation isj 
familiar and so far; 
ranks up there with; 
the greats, KelleyJ 
Jones and Charles! 
Vess, who have, 
graced the pages of 
Sandman. The\ 
Dreaming is another! 
fine offering by Ver-i 
tigo and I hope it lives;

New Works festival gets rave reviews
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
holdsbarred comedy about a turn and the nice interaction
corporate deal maker who has between Tim Dawson and
leukemia. He discovers Patricia Paton in the lead roles. 
Although the Pittsburgh New (through sketchy means) that Last on the nights bill was 
Works Festival extends over Relative Strangers, a comedy
four weeks and includes with a touch of drama thrown
12 plays, I saw only 
three of them. How
ever, if they are any 
indication of the 
quality of the rest of 
the festival, then 
there is some pretty . 
good talent floating 
around Pittsburgh.
All the plays are 
performed in one act 
on a stage sur
rounded by seats on 
three sides. The ex
tremely small size 
of the theater cre
ates a startling 
sense of closeness 
between the actors j
and the audience, w
which only helps to 
drive the material 
home.
The first play was Pizza, 
Again, a comedy with dra
matic touches. Set on a park 
bench, the play deals with 
two strangers who meet, get 
close, and then fall apart. What 
first appears to be a simple play 
about a hook-up blossoms into a 
portrayal of two people at polar 
opposites in the cycle of a rela
tionship.
The interactions between 
them are tentative at first, but 
become more relaxed as they 
see a bit of each other in them
selves; just because they are 
going in opposite directions in 
life doesnt mean that they have 
nothing in common (including 
pizza).
While only mildly funny, the 
play is well acted by Rich Keitel 
and Amy Hartman.
The next play was Numerous 
Trees Sometimes, a funny noin. Marie

4 *
Harvey (Ellie 
Reese) and Marie 
Barrett (Kathleen Joyce) 
are strangers when they meet 
plane flight, but by the
time the plane lands, they are 
so to a lesser degree. Marie 
Barrett has been looking for a 
mother, someone to answer all 
her questions, all her life. Now 
that she has found her in Marie 
Harvey, the woman next to her 
on the plane, the other Marie 
wants no part of the idea. It 
would all end here were it not 
for the stewardess (Katina 
Forte) who is the voice of con
science. By the conclusion, the 
two Maries have come to terms 
with each other and found 
things that were missing in 
their lives.
All three of the short plays 
are good examples of what a 
one-act play should be; they all 
take a simple concept and work 
it out to its conclusion, but 
include enough complexity that 
we are not bored after a few 
minutes or left without any 
questions at the conclusion. 
They let us laugh, they make us 
think, and perhaps they reveal 
parts of our nature we never 
knew were there.
his second cousin is an exact 
match for bone marrow and 
must convince her to give him 
what he needs to survive. JThe 
only problem is that she feels 
he is such a horrible person that 
he doesnt deserve to live. Simi
lar to the first play, the charac
ters are diametrically opposed; 
Conrad the deai-maker cares 
only for money while Marjorie 
the painter cares about whats 
going on inside a person. These 
attitudes are mutually exclu
sive and must be resolved by 
the end of the play. In the 
meantime, we are treated to 
great acting fueled largely by a 
taut script.
