PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1910
THE HOCKEY SITUATION
Hockey is the one sport in which Tech has always 
been a consistent winner. The conditions in and 
about Pittsburgh have been extremely favorable to 
the game with the result that Carnegie has always 
had a team which has competed with and won from 
the best colleges and universities in the country. It 
is hoped that the high standard be maintained.
The situation confronting the hockey team this 
year is one new to Tech but not unusual among col
leges. Owing to the conversion of Duquesne Garden 
ice rin'k into a roller skating shed, the team is with
out a regular place to practice and must depeud upon 
out-of-door ice sheets to work upon. This puts the 
question of a good team up to the fellows them
selves.
Arrangements are being made to flood Tech field 
and as soon as this is accomplished, the weather per
mitting, urgent call for candidates will be made. Men 
who are out for the team must watch the bulletin 
boards constantly. The practices will depend alto
gether upon weather conditions and owing to the fact 
that regular practice will not be possible, every man 
must be at every practice every minute to get the 
full benefit of the work-outs. A big trip is planned 
for the middle of January and the time for developing 
a first-class team is short.
The Board of Control has elected Jas. H. Knapp 
manager of the team and has made a wise selection. 
Mr. Knapps experience as manager of the Plebe foot
ball team in 1908 and as assistant manager of last 
years varsity football team, will stand him in good 
stead in his present position. His business ability 
and sound judgment have been shown time and again 
in the different student activities in which he has 
taken part. R. M. Scott, assistant hockey manager
is a Plebe and consequently an unknown quantity as 
yet. However he looks like a man who can do things 
and should make good.
Alan Bright, captain of the seven, is the greatest 
hockey player Tech has ever known. As a forward he 
is unexcelled, being a sure shot and one of the fastest 
hockey skaters in the game today. He should prove 
an able leader.
Besides Captain Bright, who is a forward, the fol
lowing men from last years team are back: Defense, 
Minnemeyer, Engstrom, McCracken; Forward, Joe 
Low, Harmer, Flood (sub). With these players as a 
nucleous ,the team this year should prove superior to 
any which has represented Carnegie upon the ice.
Manager Knapp has been extremely active during 
the past few weeks in the matter of schduling games. 
He is corresponding with West Point, Rensselaer, Col
umbia and several other big colleges in th East and 
the prospects for an eastern trip are very bright. 
Tech is well known in hockey circles and is held in 
respect by her opponents who recognize the merits 
of good, clean, straight sport. Arrangements have 
been practically completed for a trip through the 
West. This will be Techs first series of games and 
will probably take place in the middle of January. 
Case, Western Reserve, Denison and other schools 
will probably be on the card. Tech is well liked by 
Cleveland ice fans, wTho think that Bright and one or 
two others of the Plaidites are just about the last 
Word in hockey perfection.
Getting down to business the situation resolves it
self into this: Every man who is interested in hockey 
must keep his eyes open for practice and be at every 
practice. This applies with special emphasis to men 
trying out for forward positions. Time is short and

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
our facilities are not of the best. Men who are trying 
for forward positions should also make it a point to 
get in all the skating possible between now and the 
time the first practice is called. Speed and endurance 
are prime factors and must be cultivated at every op
portunity. If Tech field is not flooded within the next 
few days, men who are trying for defensive positions 
may be given some preliminary training in the gym
nasium. Everything possible will be done to produce 
a team capable of upholding Techs excellent reputa
tion in the game. Physical Director McCulloch 
is an enthusiastic follower of the sport and is con
siderable of an authority on hockey practice. Mr. 
McCulloch will coach the team this year, thus giving 
the boys the advantage over previous teams, that of 
having the services of a regular coach who knows 
the game and knows how to teach it.
As a last word let us repeat the statement of the 
absolute necessity for co-operation of all candidates 
with the men in control of the team. Every minute 
of practice will count and upon the shoulders of 
every man lies the responsibility of giving Carnegie 
Tech a good, fast, winning hockey team.
VARSITY BASKETBALL.
Owing to the quick responses which the students 
made to the call for financial aid for the basket-ball 
team, Manager Blanchard has been enabled to com
plete the following schedule of seventaen games: 
January 7Allegheny at Meadville.
13Bucknell at Lewisburg.
 14Penn State at State.
21Open.
 28Marietta at Marietta.
 30Ohio University at Athens.
 31Cedarville at Cedarville.
February 3Mt. Union at Alliance.
4Hiram at Hiram.
10Grove City at Pittsburgh.
11Pitt at University of Pittsburgh.
13Geneva at Pittsburgh,
17Grove City at Grove City.
18Marietta at Pittsburgh.
 22Allegheny at Pittsburgh.
24Geneva at Beaver Falls.
25Pitt at Tech.
The team is fortunate in having an exceptional, 
good coaching staff. Mr. Lightner fills the position 
of head coach and the way he is succeeding in getting 
the men down to hard work speaks well for a success
ful season. As assistants, Mr. McCulloch will pro
bably take charge of the guards and Dr. Schaffer the 
forwards. Besides these men the staff will be aug
mented by Doc Flint, the wrell known Penn man.
Between 30 and 40 men are now out for the team, 
and the task of picking out five men to represent the 
school will be a difficult one. Heltz, the big center 
from Knoxville seems to be the find of the season, 
his jumping and work under the basket being excep
tionally good. Of the men out last week, Jordan, Kil
gore and Williams look like the best bets for forward 
positions. All three men are accurate shooters, with
Williams probably leading the list. Mandeville, 
Saunders and Humphreys look like good material for 
guards. Mandeville should make a good scoring 
guard, as he is very good on long shots. Saunders is 
probably the best man on the squad for passing.
Besides the above mentioned men, there are a 
number of experienced men in school wrho are ex
pected out this week. DuBarry of the State 08 team 
and Williams of our own team of that year are both 
in night school. Young, of local reputation, will pro
bably also be out this week.
From present appearances, Carnegie Tech may ex
pect a veiy successful season.
Of the six home games the Allegheny and Pitt 
games will be the only ones at which the student 
tickets will not be honored.
CROSS COUNTRY TEAM.
The Cross Country Team under the leadership of 
Captain Wait has been practicing faithfully for the 
Annual Run of the Pittsburgh Athletic Association 
which is to be held next Saturday.
Last Saturday morning the Cross Country Team 
accompanied by some five or six other men partici
pated in a Hare and Hound Chase through the Schenley Park district. The deep snow of the past week 
hindered the men a great deal in their running, and 
also tended to reduce the number of participants. The 
Hares were led by Captain Wait and although there 
was not much difficulty in following the trail, such a 
hot pace wras set that the Hounds never even had a 
chance to catch the leaders.
INTER-CLASS BASKET-BALL.
Director McCulloch is very anxious that the differ
ent classes take action regarding inter-class basket
ball teams. It has been planned to have a league 
formed of all the different classes in school and to 
have regular scheduled games two or three times a 
week. Mr.'McCulloch is very desirous of starting 
the games immediately after the Christmas holidays, 
and it would be of great convenience to him in pre
paring a schedule if each class would elect some man 
to take charge of the team and confer with Mr. Mc
Culloch before Friday of this week concerning it. 
It has been suggested that in case it is not possible to 
call class meetings that the president of each class 
appoint some man temporarily to this office.
As has been stated before, this league is to be com
posed of men not on the varsity team from each class 
in the schools. Get busy fellows and start something.

GYMNASIUM SUITS.
Notices nave recently been posted in the Field House 
stating that no man would be allowed on the floor 
unless dressed in a regular gym suit. For the con
venience of the fellows, Mr. MeCulloch has received 
prices on two different suit combinations and the men 
are urged to place their order with him or Mr. Hull 
as soon as possible.
A suit composed of one woolen shirt, (white); one 
pair woolen stockings, (blue); one pair sateen run
ning pants, (blue); one pair rubber soled shoes, 
(black), price $2.65.
The same combination can be obtained with a cot
ton shirt and cotton stockings instead of wool for 
$1.95.
GYMNASIUM WORK.
Ever since the opening of the Field House, the 
floor of the gymnasium has been in constant demand 
by both those who are playing basket-ball and those 
who are interested in the gymnasium work. Director 
McCulloch has been conducting informal classes 
practically every evening at which one finds both 
students and professors who wish to forget their 
daily cares and troubles for an hour or so.
After the Christmas holidays all the work at the 
gym will be done during hours scheduled for that 
work. At the present time a schedule is in the 
hands of the Deans of the respective schools for rat
ification which will call for a certain time for each 
class and department in gymnastics.
Practically all the apparatus has been installed on 
the floor of the gymiiasium and everything is now in 
waiting for the re-opening of school.
INTERESTING ITEMS.
Mr. W. P. Field has been elected one of the five 
trustees who are to found a Yale Scholarship Fund 
for the Pittsburgh District.
Prof. Hornbostel lectured before the Art Society 
in Carnegie Lecture Hall on Tuesday night.
Miss Sue Watson, of the School of Applied Design, 
is working on a bust of Col. Edward J. Allen. The 
bust will be placed in Memorial Hall when finished.
INTERCOLLEGIATE HOCKEY.
New York City will not long monopolize all the 
eastern intercollegiate hockey games. A new rink 
has been opened at Boston this year and part of the 
games will be played there. Harvard will thus be 
able to play her games practically at home.
Boston Tech has inaugurated a training table for 
its basket ball team.
JUNIOR MECHANICAL BANQUET.
As a fitting climax to a very successful season, the 
Junior Mechanicals celebrated by holding a banquet 
in honor of the Junior Mechanical football team. The 
feed took place at the Fort Pitt Hotel, Wednesday 
evening, December 7. Almost every member of the 
light brigade was present. Professor Trinks held 
the post of honor as the guest of the class. The 
entire Senior Mechanical class was also in attendance 
by invitation of the Juniors.
The office of toastmaster was ably filled by Lefty 
Manker, whose commanding address and genial pres
ence added much to the charm of the occasion. Dur
ing the evening, speeches were rendered by Professor 
Trinks, Mr. Hanford 10, Coach David Henderson, 
Manager Harry Holiday, Captain Luther M. Patter
son and Third-baseman James K. Lamoree.
Professor Trinks spoke first about the Carnegie 
Mechanical Society and discussed the proposition of 
awarding a money prize to the alumnus that reads the 
best paper on some technical subject before the so
ciety. The latter half of his speech was devoted to 
an intensely interesting description of German uni
versity life. He touched upon the two popular forms 
of athletics over therebeer drinking and fencing. 
His talk was very instructive throughout. His 
humorous exposition of the methods of teaching and 
methods of flunking at his Alma Mater at Charlottenburg was full of fun and wit.
Mr. Hanford spoke for the Senior Mechanicals and 
in a few appropriate words expressed the good feel
ing which exists between the Junior and Senior 
classes.
The speeches delivered by the Messrs. Henderson, 
Holiday and Patterson were characterized mainly by 
an attempt to place the credit for the successful sea
son upon each others shoulders. The fact that the 
team went through a trying season without losing a 
game was emphasized and those responsible were 
lauded to the utmost.
The banquet was one of the prettiest affairs of the 
season. The good-fellowship and class spirit evinced 
by the men is one of the best things in our short 
college career, and should be cultivated. The Juniors 
in charge of the feed deserve especial mention for the 
excellent way in which it was conducted.
SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES IN SESSION.
A very important meeting of scientific men from 
all parts of this country will be held during the last 
week of this month in Carnegie Music Hall. The 
National Geological Society will hold its sessions De
cember twenty-seventh and twenty-ninth, inclusive, 
and th American Paleonotological Society from the 
twenty-ninth to thirty-first inclusive. In connection 
with the meetings of these men, Dr. Holland direc
tor of the Carnegie Museum, will give the first view 
of the bones of the dinosaur. Both Director Hamerschlag and Mr. Tarbell are on the committee in 
charge of the meetings.

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
MHO CLUB.
The regular monthly meeting of the Mho Club was 
held last Wednesday evening, December 7, in Room 
121, A. S. Building. The evening was largely taken 
up by a debate and discussion on the Advantages 
of the Edison over the Lead Storage Battery. The 
affirmative was upheld by Brand and Johnston, of 
the Soph, class, and the negative by Hunter and 
Patterson, of the Juniors. The subject was exceed
ingly well handled by the separate speakers and 
showed considerable preparation on their part. The 
construction, operation and theory of the two types 
was thoroughly discussed and each man presented 
his views in a convincing manner. The decision was 
given in favor of the negative. In the discussion 
that followed almost every member present took 
part and considerable information in regard to the 
Storage Battery was brought up.
A new departure in the conducting of the meetings 
is to be tried at the next session. It is desired to 
bring in other subjects and amusements, which are 
not directly allied with Engineering, but at the same 
time will prove instructive as well as entertaining. 
In this matter the meetings can be made interesting 
to others outside of the club members. In the future 
the meetings will be open and visitors will be wel
comed. It is thus thought that the scope of the Club 
can be widened and better and more far-reaching 
results be obtained. A committee has been appoint
ed to make arrangements for the next meeting and 
something out of the ordinary is promised.
APPLIED INDUSTRIES. 
Industrials Lose.
The Allegheny Prep. School five defeated the Car
negie Tech Industrials by the score of 38 to 10 Fri
day night, December 9, on the Prep, floor. The sen
sational work of Forter, who captured 12 field goals,
was a feature.Tfle Industrials could not get started

THE CHRISTMAS PLAY.
The first 1910 performance of The Triumph 01 
St. Nicholas, the traditional play of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School, was given Tuesday even
ing in the gymnasium of the School. The audience 
was composed mainly of students, this performance 
being given especially for them, and the auditorium 
was crowded. The play, which is written and 
staged by Miss Elizabeth R. Stoner, of the M. M. C.
S., is a creation of rare merit. The dialogue is well 
balanced and the songs and lyrics are full of beauty 
and significance. The action throughout the production is cleverly advanced and shows the work of a 
master-hand. The girls are indeed fortunate in com
manding the talent and services of a writer and or
ganizer of Miss otoners ability.
The play was well acted throughout. The play 
itself is practically unchanged from last year. How
ever, several new songs and an almost entirely new 
cast of the principal characters make the produc
tion at once interesting and new. Although handi
capped by a short time for practice and the prox
imity of examinations, the girls enacted" their parts 
in masterly fashion. The singing was good and the 
costumes very pretty. An interesting point in the 
latter connection was the wearing of the two jewels 
brought over last summer from Scotland by Dean 
West. The jewels greatly enhanced the beauty of 
the Tartan Maids costume, of which they are now 
a part.
The play will be given again on Thursday evening 
and will be open to the putilic. The performers will 
be at their best and a rare treat is assured those 
who attend.
The Guild of the M. M. C. S. held its first open 
meeting on Saturday, December 11, 1910. At this 
meeting. Katherine Swickard, the first president of 
the Guild, read the Constitution and handed it over 
to Elizabeth Lawrie, the new president.
A bazaar was held in connection with the meeting. 
The alumni had a table of Christmas articles made 
and donated by the girls. This table was beauti
fully decorated with appropriate Christmas colors.
The Seniors of the School had a candy and cake 
booth decorated*with greens and tiny electric lights. 
The attractiveness of this table was greatly en
hanced by the original and dainty boxes made by 
Dean West.
All members donated bathing suits for Kingsley 
House, so that the children may all go swimmm  
at their summer home in Valencia. While tea and 
cake was being served to the guests by the girls in 
cooking costume, a short musical program was 
given:

niversary this fall.
SOPHOMORES.
At a recent meeting of the Sophomore class, con
siderable time was spent on the subject of finance. 
At the beginning of this year there were a number of 
bills to be paid and to meet these a certain amount 
was pledged by each man. Only a very small propor
tion of this amount has been paid and as a result, 
there still are some unpaid bills. Through the gener
osity of certain individuals in the class this money 
has been advanced and it is only fair to them as class 
mates that those who so far have neglected in this 
matter, pay it to the class treasurer before the vaca
tion. This notice applies to the Design Sophomores 
as well as the Science men.
Professor Lowe last week delighted the Sophomore 
class by the announcement that they were to be 
given a chance to vote whether or not they would be 
compelled to hand in written reports in Heat Labratory. In place of fne reports notes were to be kept in 
such shape that they could be understood any time 
later and also the class was to be subject to an exam
ination at the end of the year in laboratory work. 
Practically all the sections voted to try the new plan 
as an experiment for a month or so, with the option 
of being allowed to re-adopt the old plan in case they 
were not satisfied.
One of the sophomores is credited with saying that 
there comes a time once a month when he wishes he 
was in any other place in the country but Carnegie 
Tech. This must be one of those timesquizzes 
everyday, and small chance to study when a fellow is 
consulting railroad time tables trying to figure the 
quickest way to get back home to see the Girl He 
Left Behind Him.

ATHLETICS.
One of the most pleasing developments during the 
past few weeks is the way in which athletics have 
progressed. The period following directly upon the 
heels of the football season is usually a quiet one, 
due in a great measure to the reaction which comes 
after three months of that strenuous game. Such 
has not been the case at Tech. Basket ball was taken 
up at once and an unusually good squad is at work; 
the hockey team is waiting impatiently for a chance 
to practice, and as soon as a call for candidates is 
issued, there is little doubt but that quite a large 
number will respond; the cross-counti'y team, under 
the able leadership of Captain* Wait, is in excellent 
condition and expects to make a good showing in the 
P. A. A. run next Saturday; the races and inter-class 
contests which hav been held under the direction of 
Mr. McCulloch have brought out large numbers of 
the athletic lesser lights. On a whole, the interest 
manifested by the students is good and there is no 
reason why Tech should not go through the winter 
represented by good strong teams. Mr. McCulloch 
and others who are advancing the cause are doing 
an excellent work and deserve great credit for their 
efforts.

DR. RAINSFORD SPEAKS TO STUDENT BODY.
Fine Address Given to Students.
Last Tuesday morning Dr. Rainsford of New 
York, who, it will be remembered, gave our Com
mencement address last year, spoke again to the en
tire student body. It was announced to the separate 
classes Tuesday morning that Dr. Rainsford was tp 
speak and the big lecture hall in the Science Building 
was filled to over-flowing. It is perfectly safe to say 
that none of the students went away from the hall 
without the wish that the Doctor keep his promise 
and come again soon to tell us about'his hunting trip 
in the wilds of Africa.
Director Hamerschlag introduced Doctor Rains
ford, who commenced his address by saying that we 
must not deem him conceited if he talked a great 
deal of himself, that being the one great source of 
experience from which any man could draw. He 
then preceeded to tell us of his early life in England 
and how he came to change his vocation from that 
of a soldier to one of helpfulness in the slums of 
London. He told of his first trip to this country 
and his wonderful trip in company with his brotherin-law across the plains. His story of how he im
pressed upon the Chief that he did not want the 
Doctors only gun will long exist. After telling of 
his early struggles in New York and of the help he 
received from his group of young men, among whom, 
by the way, was Director Hamerschlag, he brought 
out the fact that this country had before it a great 
task, a great duty, and that its fulfillment concerned 
no one group but all of us. The duty is the proving 
to the world that justice can and does exist for all, 
rich and poor alike, and that this country is the 
place where it may be obtained.
Dr. Rainsford also hit a mark when he spoke of 
the giving out a mans nervous system in this life of 
continual strain. His advice to get back to nature 
instead of indulging in a bat was very good.
It is to be sincerely hoped that chance will be 
made for Doctor Rainsford to come back soon and 
tell of his lions and other things.
NEW BOARD OF CONTROL MEETS.
Lively Session Held by Governing Body of Athletic 
Association
The first meeting of the 1910-11 Board of Control 
of the Athletic Association took place in the Applied 
Science building, Wednesday evening, December 7th. 
The meeting was well attended, practically every 
member of the Board being on hand. The first busi
ness transacted was the election of officers for the 
coming year. After the ballots were counted the re
sults were found to be as follows:
PresidentAlan Bright, 11.
Vice-PresidentW. G. Blanchard, 12.
SecretaryR. S. Dornberger, 13.
The new officers then took charge of the meeting 
and the business at hand was taken up. The resig

nation of Guy C. Hecker, manager of baseball was 
read and accepted. President Bright declared the 
office vacant and called for the election of a man to 
fill the office. After a particularly heated discussion, 
during the course of which several strenuous speech
es were made by members of the Board, C. C. Hixenbaugh, 12, assistant manager, was elected to the po
sition. Mr. Hixenbaugh is an able man and will 
make a successful manager. The office of first assist
ant, vacated by Mr. Hixenbaugh, was left to be filled 
at some future date. The fact was then brought up 
that Ray Light, manager of last years track team had 
been omitted from the list of men granted letters at 
the previous Board Meeting. Mr. Light was awarded 
his C with little discussion. At the suggestion of 
one of the members, the Board instructed Secretary 
Dornberger to send notes of appreciation to Louis 
Middleman, Walton and Merle Hatton, men who had 
played football on this years' team but who on ac
count of injuries did not complete the required num
ber of games to be awarded letters. Following this 
a short informal discussion was indulged in, after 
which the meeting was adjourned.
The meeting was by far the liveliest and most in
teresting held by a Board of Control for many months 
The new Board shows signs of coming to life and con
ducting affairs in the business-like manner which the 
importance of its work demands.
CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
The December student meeting of the Crucible 
Club was held Decei*-oer 7th in Room 216. After the 
transaction of the routine business Mr. H. F. Englebrecht, Chem. 12, read a very creditable paper on 
Carborundum. Starting with the discovery of car
borundum by Mr. Acheson in Pittsburgh several years 
ago, he traced the process through its experimental 
stages, and concluded by very clearly outlining the 
present practice as carried on at Niagara Falls. Fol
lowing the above paper Mr. C. B. Calloman, Chem., 12, 
read a carefully prepared paper on The Commercial 
Manufacture of Nitric Acid. Following a few prelim
inary statements, as to the theory of the processes in
volved, the sources of raw materials were discussed. 
Mr. Calloman then considered the chief commercial 
processes and gave a summary of tne advantages and 
disadvantages of each. In the general discussion 
which followed Dr. Fernekes took a leading and ag
gressive part. Mr. Dot J. Felkel, 09, regaled the Club 
with many humorous incidents pretaining to his work. 
Dot seems to be a mortal enemy of the Hunkies. 
Dr. James was in a happy mood and kept the crowd in 
good spirits by relating humorous incidents and anec
dotes in connection with his Chemical experience. 
The refreshments committee served a very appetiz
ing lunch after which the meeting adjourned.
The standard of the meetings being held merits the 
attendance and cooperation of the students, alumni 
and faculty. The Secretary endeavors to notify the 
alumni of the meetings. If any have not received 
such notices they will confer a favor upon the Sec
retary by sending him their present addresses that 
notices may reach them in the future.
R. C. Brown, Secretary,

APPLIED DESIGN.
First Year Night.
One of the most successful affairs of its kind was 
the Smoker held by the First Year Night Class in 
the assembly room of the Applied Industries build
ing, Saturday evening, December 10. A large crowd 
of fellows were present and it did not take the 
crowd long to mix together in the most congenial 
manner. The first part of the evening was taken 
up by a number of musical selections rendered by 
the First Year Night Orchestra. The orchestra, 
consisting of nine pieces, presented a line of music 
which was really good. They were given generous 
applause and had to respond to several encores be
fore they were allowed to retire. A business meet
ing of the class was then called by President Jones. 
After several items of importance were passed upon, 
the meeting was adjourned. During the remainder 
of the evening the men were entertained by recita
tions by Messrs. Lonergan, Cameron, Weisman and 
Wesoscy. Refreshments were served'at a late hour, 
and after singing a bunch of old familiar songs, the 
meeting was broken up. The First Year Night men 
are to be congratulated upon the way they are get
ting together this year.
CHRISTMAS VACATION.
Notice has been issued that the Christmas vaca
tion will extend this year from December 16th until 
January 3d.
The majority of the students who live out of town 
will spend the two weeks at home, celebrating the 
holiday season in the midst of their family circles. 
Quite a number of the men will find employment 
during their vacation and will thus earn a tidy sum 
while resting from their term of mental exercise. 
When the Schools re-open at the first of the year, 
reviews for the finals of the first semester will prob
ably be started. The students will be well able to 
take up the work with a keen relish after their rest.
JUNIOR PROM COMMITTEE MEETS.
President Henderson of the Junior Prom Com
mittee called the first meeting of that body last 
week. The course of action to be pursued was dis
cussed and passed upon at length. Although quite 
a few of the important details of the big dance have 
been fixed, nothing has as yet been definitely set
tled. Full information will be published in the next 
issue of The Tartan.
Dartmouth College has received a gift of $500,000

The unquestioned value of the recently discovered 
deposits of zinc carbonate and silicate at Leadville 
has directed attention to the inexplicable reason for 
overlooking them in years gone by. Noted geolo
gists, such as Emmons and Irving, have given the 
matter their attention, but without offering any sat
isfactory reason for the oversight, except that at the 
time the deposits were first opened it was probable 
that the miner was so intent upon the discovery of 
gold and silver that he neither regarded the zince 
minerals as having value, nor did he have them ana
lyzed to ascertain such a possibility.
Be that as it may, the deposits now known to ex
ist and from which shipments have already been 
made, are of sufficient importance to warrant the 
Colorado School of Mines preparing a special bulletin 
on the genesis and extent of the deposits, the identi
fication of the minerals and the assay of the ore. In 
view of the specially favorable market for zinc at 
the present time the mining and reduction of these 
ores must be of great benefit to the industry.Met

could not understand the menu. First the waiter 
brought him soup. Again he pointed, and again it 
was soup. After three courses of soup he was pin
ing for something more solid, so he pointed to the 
last item of all, feeling pretty sure that he had 
missed the soup this time. The obliging waiter

THE ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND AND 
AMERICA.
In the course of an address given before the Man
chester, England, section of the Institution of Elec
trical Engineers, Mr. J. S. Peck, chairman of that 
body, gave some reasons why America had excelled 
England in electrical matters. As Mr. Peck had just 
returned to England after a trip to this country he 
was particularly well fitted to give an opinion on the 
subject, and at least three of the points upon which 
he dwelt are worthy of a brief consideration.
In the first place, he stated municipal control does 
not exist here to such a degree as in England, and 
when a party of men enter upon an important devel
opment work they feel that any profit which may ac
crue will go to them; a fact which at least adds in
centive to the project.
The superior technical education given to the stud
ents in our engineering schools was another reason 
given, although as far as pure technics are concerned 
many hold the English schools to be superior to our 
own. There seems, however, to be but little doubt of 
the superiority of the American method of starting 
the technical graduate in the shop on the testing 
floor and letting him work out his own salvation. One 
has only to look over the list of men in the appren
ticeship courses to see that technical graduates of all 
countries are realizing this fact as well as we do our
selves. It is in our factories that the graduate learns 
the relation of theory to practice; and a knowledge 
of this relation is necessary as a firm basis for indus
trial progress.
Finally the greater daring of the American busi
ness man,.and his willingness to advance money for 
untried, but plausible projects has contributed much 
to our progress. So keen is this interest in new ven
tures that bond issues of new companies are frequent
ly overscribed. We experience but little of the diffi
culty in raising money, which is met by our English 
cousins.Electrical Review and Western Electrician.
The latest innovation to college athletics is Crowdball, invented at Wisconsin. The crowd ball itself 
is an inflated leather thiijg 24 inches in diameter. 
The game, which is played on a football field, has no 
rules whatsoever. The opposing teams may be of any 
size provided they are equal. The object is to rush 
kick, throw, or carry the ball beyond the opponents 
goal post. No downs are called; any tactics are fair.
THINK IT OVER.
If you must have wrinkles, get them from laugh
ing.
A good executive makes quick decisions. But if 
these are merely snap judgments, lacking consid
eration of conditions and consequences, hes not a 
good executive.
The man who never makes a mistake is too slow 
to be useful in these days of action.
Experience teaches lessons that colleges never 
dreamed of.
The boss says a peck of initiative is worth a barrel 
of initiation.
The ambitious man is certain to succeed. All the 
good that has ever been done in this world has been 
accomplished by ambitious fellowsmen of action.
A wise man suppresses fully two-thirds of his 
opinions.
Really big men dont have swelled heads. Ever

Dont pity the busy man. Hes happy. The man 
nursing a soft snap is the one who needs real sym
pathythough he may not deserve it.
It is better to make a few mistakes than to do 
nothing at allbut dont make too many.

I quit worrying about the people who dont like me.
