Carnegie Quint 
In 71-49 Win
Riehl Leads Plaid Five 
In Multi-Foul Contest
Two basketball giants named Ed 
Dahler and Charley Cooper spell
ed defeat to a game but outclass
ed Carnegie Tech basketball team 
last night as Duquesne University 
pounded out another 71-49 win.
Amid a near record total of 52 
personal fouls, the upset minded 
Tartans battled the nationally 
ranked Iron Dukes on even terms 
throughout the first and third 
quarters. They proved no match 
for the smooth working Hilltoppers, however, in the closing mo
ments and fell victims of several 
of the host teams Skendrovich en
gineered scoring streaks.
Second To None
Brilliant Jack Riehl, matching 
first half set shots with Jim Far
rell, led the Plaid attack with 11 
points and flashed a form second 
to none on the floor.
Coach Mel Cratsleys hard driv
ing quintet found the board work 
of Cooper and V*e sharp shooting 
Of the Million Dahler Kid too 
much though and were unable to 
keep the torrid pace which the 
Bluffites wasted no time in set
ting.
The Tartans held a 2-1 lead for 
a few moments early in the con
test by virtue of Tom Becks first 
basket and at one time midway in 
the second period had cut the vic
tors lead to five points.
Summary
Parking Notice
All students who violate parking regulations are now sub
ject to $5.00 fines. A system, approved by Student Council and 
recommended to the administration, has already been put into 
operation. The new plan involves the use of two notices which 
are as follows:
1st: Parking violation notice.
This area must be cleared of all cars that are not parked 
properly. When your car is parked in a driving lane so that 
other cars cannot enter or leave or is parked outside of the areas 
assigned, a fine of $5.00 will be assessed and collected. In addi
tion, it may be necessary to move your car.
2nd: Notice of fine assessment for parking violation.
On previous occasions you have been careless and without 
consideration for other drivers in the manner in which you have 
parked your car. Records show that you have received the first 
parking violation notice provided by regulations. A fine of $5.00 
has been charged against your account, and this notice must be 
presented at the cashiers office and payment made in order for  
you to remain a student in good standing.
This system has been put into operation to cover all of the 
parking areas on Carnegie Institute of Technology property.

Carnegie Corporation Grants 
CIT Education Plan $100.000
Dr. Doherty Announces Gift Will Develop 
Professional Program In Engineering School
Aetor Reads 
For Students 
Tuesday Niglit
Carnegie has received a $100,000 grant in support of its pioneer
ing educational plan, President Robert E. Doherty announced re
cently.
The grant, made by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, will 
be given to the school in three an-* 
nual installments as an aid in de
veloping its Plan of Professional 
Education, specifically in the Col
lege of Engineering and Science,
Dr. Doherty said.
The generous gift is not an 
addition to our endowment, Dr.
Dtherty emphasized. It is, insead, current money which we 
will use in the next three years 
in further developing our plan.
No Connection 
The Carnegie Corporation has 
no direct connection with Car
negie Institute of Technology. Un
til 1946, the corporation was a 
parent body for the school. But in 
that year, in accordance with 
long-range objectives set up in 
1921, the corporation increased 
the Carnegie Tech endowment by 
eight million dollars and, at that 
time, ended its responsibility to
ward the school.
Since then, Carnegie has had to 
compete for corporation funds on 
the same basis as any other insti
tution.
In commenting on the $100,000 
gift, Charles Dollard, president of 
the corporation, said it was grant
ed enthusiastically.
Tribute To President 
He remarked that the gift rep
resents in a real sense a tribute 
to Dr. Dohertys accomplishments 
and a vote of confidence in Pres
ident-Elect Dr. J. C. Warner who 
will take over when President 
Doherty retires this year.
President Doherty said that to 
create its plan, Carnegie had to, 
reform its basic objectives, make 
time for a new curriculum, design 
the new curriculum, and, most 
important, find out how to teach 
and what to teach in order to 
make the new curriculum and ob
jectives more than just words.
Four Stage Program 
Dr. Doherty explained that the 
first three stakes are about three 
years and the fourth at least ten.
He announced today that Carnegie 
is now approximately half-way 
through the fourth stage.
The $100,000 Carnegie Corpora
tion grant, he pointed out, will be 
used to help Carnegie Tech 
through that last, important stage.
? The Kiltie Band and its Direc
tor, William A. Schaefer, will be 
hosts to the Third Annual Inter
collegiate Band Festival of Penn
sylvania on Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday, February 23, 24 and 25.
The festival will bring over 150 
college musicians and band direc
tors to the Carnegie campus from 
the western part of the state.
Sponsored by the Pennsylvania 
Collegiate Bandmasters Associa
tion and the Pennsylvania Music 
Educators Association, the Inter
collegiate State Band will present 
two concerts at Carnegie Music 
Halla student matinee on Fri
day, February 24 at 4:00 and an 
evening concert on Saturday, Feb
ruary 25 at 8:15 p. m.
Mark H. Hindsley, Director of 
the University of Illinois Band, 
will be guest conductor. He is a 
past president of the National Col
lege Bandmasters Association. As 
a conductor, lecturer and writer, 
he is known throughout the coun
try in school musical circles.
Thirty Pennsylvania colleges 
will take part in the festival and 
concerts. The Kiltie band and the 
University of Pittsburgh band will 
be the local organizations repre
sented.
Tickets for concerts, which will 
be open to the public, may be ob
tained from Kiltie band members.
Charles Laughton will give his 
famous readings from the Bible 
and from works by Shakespeare, 
Thomas Wolfe, James Thurber, 
Charles Dickens, and Aesop at a 
special performance for college 
students and faculty next Tuesday 
evening in the Syria Mosque at 
7:00 p. m.
He will also give all of his 
movie characterizations, including 
Captain Bligh, and Henry VIII.
Seven hundred reserved seats 
are being held for Carnegie Tech 
students at $1.30 including tax. At 
the later show at nine oclock for 
the general public, the admission 
price is three dollars plus tax.
Tickets may be purchased in the 
public relations office and in the 
drama department office through 
Satuxday, February 18.
Housing Needed
The Kiltie Band, hosts for the 
Intercollegiate Band Festival, 
urgently needs housing for 96 
male students who will be 
guests on the campus during the 
festival. Anyone who can ac
commodate one or more of these 
guests for the nights of Febru
ary 23 or 24 is requested to con
tact the Dean of Mens office.
Survey Slioivs 
Absentee Trend
Ten Percent Absence 
Noted Before Vacation
Are 10 per cent absences before 
vacation a problem? The admin
istration has not yet come to a de
cision, but this figure was dis
closed as the average absence in 
a Thanksgiving vacation survey. 
This survey, conducted by the Un
dergraduate Advisory Committee, 
may be used to decide future ad
ministrative policy concerning 
cutting.
Results showed that there was 
little absence on the day following 
vacation. However, the day pre
ceding vacations had approxi
mately twice the number of ab
sences as the day preceding it.
Definite cyclical patterns were 
also brought to light. That is, it 
became evident that the percent
age of absences on the Saturday 
before vacations equaled that of 
the day preceding vacation.
This trend was most noticeable 
in the Division of Humanistic and 
Social Studies. Absences on these 
days in Engineering and Science 
were highest in the physics de
partment. No such pattern ex
isted in Margaret Morrison since 
there are no Saturday classes.
For the entire school the aver
age percentage absent on Satur
days and the day preceding the 
vacation.-was 10 per cent. It was 
further noted that the highest 
percentage absent in any one de
partment did not exceed 15 per 
cent while the week day average 
for the school was 5 per cent.

Editorials

The action taken byStudent Council to re
lieve the tangled parking conditions on campus 
is noteworthy for two reasons.
First, the action is important because of the 
nature of the problem. It has been a long time 
since Student Council has attacked and presented 
a solution to a problem which has so directly ef
fected such a large number of students. The ac
tion also marks one of the first steps in many 
years to improve the campus life of commuting 
students.
Second, we view the solution as a com
mendable step because of Council's action to en
force the rulings. Several months ago, Coun
cil was criticized for being a tool of the Dean 
of Men. At that time we stated that the reason 
for the criticism was that Council did not use 
the powers it was given. In solving the park
ing problem, however. Council has used its 
powers and has used them effectively.
We hope the new Council is fully aware of 
its powers and responsibilties. If it is, we will 
look forward to more of this same type of ac
tion, and consequently a more enjoyable campus 
life and a student body interested in its gov
erning body.BUT THE SENTIMENT ISN'T SO SWEET
. . . And Onions Scl',ors)'l'Ps
The Class of 53 has been organized for several 
months, but we have heard nothing of any ac
tivity in the class since officers were elected. 
The Class of 52 was to have an election of offi
cers and be officially recognized before the end 
of last semester; however, the elections were post
poned because there was not sufficient interest 
among the sophomores to provide a contest.
On the surface it appears that the class or
ganization plan has failed. We certainly hope 
not, but if it has, there is still ample time to 
resuscitate what dying spirit there might be 
left.
Although one of the salient objectives of the 
plan was to provide a more closely knit alumni 
body, there are many benefits class organization 
can provide to undergraduate members as well. 
Whether graduate or undergraduate, however, a 
class must proceed beyond the point of merely 
electing officers if there are to be any benefits 
derived from it by its members and if it is to 
live .The next step must unite the entire organi
zation. The best way we know to tie together 
any group of people is to engage them in some 
common activity.
If class organizations are ever to receive a 
fair trial, they must exist for several years. 
Organization of classes will probably cease with 
the Class of 52 if no further progress is made 
within the classes beyond the election of offi
cers. It is up to the freshmen and sophomores 
then, to accept the responsibility of providing 
the opportunity for class organizations to prove 
their worth.-

Every Student 
On Scholarship
By Lloyd Dyer
Every student at Carnegie Tech is on a half
tuition scholarship. Yet one of the most import
ant functions of the school administration is to 
secure and allocate funds to students who need 
and deserve additional financial help.
Though tuition rates at CIT seem high in com
parison with other colleges, approximately half 
of the actual cost of a students academic pro
gram is paid by the school. Additional individual 
scholarships are, for the most part, also drawn 
from school funds and are generally awarded to 
students of need, scholastic promise and char
acter.
New Funds Added
Scholarships awarded last year totaled $100,-
000 from all sources; $70,000 of this sum was 
taken directly from the current operating funds 
of the school.
Too few scholarship holders fully appreciate 
the hard work which makes possible the aid they 
receive. Since Carnegies main sources of income, 
other than tuition and the interest from the Car
negie endowment, are special gifts and other en
dowments, it is necessary for the administration 
to be constantly seeking new funds.
Dollar Value Declines
As many of the endowments are given at a 
definite rate per year, the decline in the value of 
the dollar has made serious inroads into this 
source of financial aid. In one case a special fund 
of $10,000 a year helped 68 students in a year 
before the war, whereas this year it provided 
comparable help to only 38, a decline of about 
40 per cent.
With the fall in the number of students study
ing on the GI bill will come a proportionate in
crease in students desiring scholarship aid. Other 
factors, too, will tend to produce this same effect. 
The higher cost of living, local troubles in the 
steel and coal industries, and the increasing short
age of summer and part-time jobs will all add 
to the students need for financial assistance. It 
seems that the already large scholarship program 
must be further expandedwhich will mean that 
additional work must be done to secure more gifts 
and endowments from alumni, industry, and 
others.
Short Term Loans
Why is the scholarship system so necessary? 
Because Carnegie Tech is interested in obtain
ing students of high personal and professional 
promise, even though they cannot carry the en
tire financial burden of college themselves. CIT 
also strives to have students from all localities 
on campus, with the view that a mixing of opin
ions and experiences is beneficial to the student. 
Scholarships help stimulate the desire of distant 
students to attend Carnegie.
The unique program of long and short term 
loans is also of great benefit to the student. Since 
September, 1949, $22,000 has been loaned on a 
long term basis, while short term loans, in the 
year and a half of the funds existance, have to
taled $1600.
Letter To 
The Editor
Editor, the Tartan:
The article in the Tuesday, Jan
uary 10, issue of the Tartan in
fers that the idea of a musical 
show originated in 1938. As far as 
I can gather, all that originated in 
1938 was the name Scotch n 
Soda.
In 1932 a group of Dramats 
working with engineers, Maggie 
Murphs, and anyone else interest
ed in musicals organized a society 
called the Bacchanalians, whose 
general purpose paralled that of 
Scotch n Sode. While we oldtimers have no idea how success
ful Scotch n Soda shows have 
been in comparison with the 
shows that ran from 1932 through 
1935 (Incidentally, the 1932 show 
went on the road, or should I say 
 on the river  via Showboat 
style.), I can assure you we had 
some top-notch performers and 
acts. Those were the days when 
Bill Bales, who is noy dancing in 
New York, was our choreograph
er; when Heller, who is staging 
shows in New York, was our pro
duction manager; when George 
McCalmon was our humorist; 
when Herm Liveright wrote the 
lyrics for some of our more subtle 
numbers, etc. Harry Schofield, 
who received so much credit for 
being one or the organizers of 
Scotch n Soda, is an alumnus of 
the Bacchanalians.
Since I realize that you are in
terested in fair play, I trust you 
will give the proper credit where 
due.
Sincerely,
E. J. Palkot

CUT OUT ... Mr. Palkot, 35

comments on Scotch and Soda and 
its predecessor. (See letter ad

a paragraph that was cut from, 
the SnS history story of Janu
ary 10 because of space limita
tions. It is printed below exactly 
as it was supposed to have ap
peared.
SnS Club has always helped 
to make Spring Carnival an oc
casion of remembrance. The club, 
however, was not original in its 
aim to give carnival week an 
added impetus. In 1933 an organ
ization called the Bacchanalians 
was formed, for the purpose of 
producing a show for the annual 
spring carnival.
As its first effort the Baccha
nalians showed Tar and Feath
ers in the gym. As its title sug
gests, the skits satirized many 
well known persons and institu
tions. In 33 Over the Coals was 
given, of all places, at the Pitt 
Theatre.
Four shows in all were given 
by the Bacchalanians, the last two 
of which could hardly have been 
termed student productions since 
they were written by a Pittsburgh 
playwright, RoseMary Casey, 
and 4.33 pounds.

Wash-Jeff Visits Tartans Saturday
Tartan Five 
Scores Win 
Over Allegheny
Theodore Paces Plaid 
With Eighteen Points 
To 9th Win Of Year
Carnegie Tech's Tartans, smart
ing under two successive road de
feats, returned to winning form as 
they coasted to a 61-40 victoryover Allegheny. It was the ninth 
victory as against six defeats for 
the locals.
While the largest Tech crowd 
of the season watched, Mike The
odore flashed 1947 form as he 
scored 18 points to pace the Plaid 
attack. Jack Riehl and Tommy 
Beck shared the rest of the scor
ing burden, as Bill Potter lead 
the Hilltoppers with 10 points.
Sloppy plays marred the per
formances of boh teams. Tech, de
spite its sixty-one point total, had 
its lowest scoring percentage of 
the season as an unusually large 
number of shots strayed from the 
rim and backboard.
Quick Decision
With the first quarter three 
minutes old, Jack Riehl drove in 
to net the initial score of the game. 
The Tartans kept rolling from that 
point, piling up a 16-5 lead at the 
quarter and a 25-8 lead at the 
half. The locals never were 
threatened after the first three 
minutes.
Biggest Allegheny scoring 
splurge of the game came at the 
outset of the second half when the 
Blue and Gold scored 14 points to 
2 for the Tartans. The Hilltoppers 
came close to matching the Plaid 
scoring during the last half.
Tommy Beck, a season long 
kingpin for the Plaid, snapped the 
winners out of their third period 
doldrums. After a very long six 
minutes of play the diminutive 
guard broke loose on a scoring 
spree that netted him eight points 
in less than six minutes.
Theodore In Form
But the highlight of the game 
was the spirited play of Mike The
odore. Long a favorite of Tech 
fans, Mike has been having an off 
season. However, Saturdays per
formance was an exhibition of the 
old style of play of the Wilmerding Flash. He had one of his 
best evenings of the season, scor
ing eighteen points and working 
effectively under the boards.
The complete Tech team saw 
action during the game as Mel 
Oatsley cleared the bench toward 
the end of both halves.
Tartans Lose 
Two Games In 
Vacation Trip
During the recent vacation, 
Carnegie Techs basketball squad 
made a short road tour to Oberlin 
College and Case Institute of 
Technology. But instead of bring
ing back news of two victories, it 
was just the opposite.
In the Oberlin game the short 
vacation from practice proved to 
be fatal for the Plaids as the 
Tartans dropped through only 
thirteen per cent of their shots, 
getting eleve i field goals and a 
total of 41 points. The Oberlin 
Yeoman netted 16 field goals and 
61 points.
At Cleveland, the Case Roughriders finally came out on top of 
a close 72-71 score. The game was 
tight all the way with the score 
at half-time 38-36 Carnegie. Tom
my Beck turned in 20 points and 
Jack Riehl scored 19.

Carnegi^ Techs intramural 
ping pong tournament entered its 
last two weeks of play with three 
unbeaten teams sharing top hon
ors in the three leagues. PiKA 
leads the Skibo League and the 
Dorm Dukes and Tau Delts lead 
the Scot and Tartan leagues re
spectively.
A glance at the schedule would 
indicate that the first place teams 
have practically clinched their po

upset victory could unseat the 
league leaders.
With a clean sweep of six con
tests, Beta Sigma Rhos water

campus title of the year just prior 
to the close of last semester.
Kappa Sigmas runner-up found 
little trouble with the rest of the 
field before dropping a 2-1 deci

was able to register more than one 
point against the Beta Sigs, who

Thiel At Greenville
Weekeml Battle Offers Local Five 
Chance To Avenge Previous Loss
Carnegie Techs basketeers travel to Greenville, Pa. on Wed-, 
nesday night to meet Thiel College. The Tomcats, coached by 
Robert S. Cope this season, should not be too difficult for the Tar
tan squad to subdue. ?--------------------7--------------------------------
cold this year, Saturdays game 
with the red shoed W & J squadThe Thiel-Tech series started in 
1923, but the schools have met 
only eight times on the basketball 
court. Tech has taken five of the 
contests but lost by a 56-47 score 
last year. Thiel finished last sea
son with a 10-10 record. Carne
gies last win over the Tomcats 
was a 44-22 victory back in 1942.
Presidents Riding High
Saturday night the Tech team 
clashes with the Presidents of 
Washington and Jefferson at the 
Skibo gym. The Presidents, after 
dropping a 52-45 contest to Buf
falo State last Saturday, are still 
riding high with a 10-4 record. 
However, the Buffalo team was 
hardly expected to. give the Black 
and Red much of a battle and the 
outcome of the game was most 
surprising.
The W & J-Tech series began 
in 1917. Since then Carnegie has 
won 17 of the 52 contests, drop
ping both of last years games by 
69-47 and 64-34 scores. Tech has 
not handed the Presidents a de
feat since 1946 when the Tartans 
won 64-44.
In the last Tech-W & J game 
in January, the favored Tartans 
lost their winning ways and came 
out on the short end of the score. 
The Presidents offense is sparked 
by forward Andy Mestrovic, lead
ing scorer so far this season. How
ever, the scoring for the Presidents 
has not all been by Mestrovic and 
the Plaid will find that a good de
fense will be paramount against 
the two platoon system of Adam 
L. Sanders charges.
Trust the Records?
Of the mutual oponents of W 
& J and Carnegie Tech, the Pres
idents have thus far defeated 
Thiel, Bethany and Allegheny and 
have dropped contests to Waynesburg 63-49 and Penn State 51-50.
With the Plaid running hot and
defies any prediction.
Under the tutelage of Ray Forquer, former W & J star, the Red 
and Black freshmen team has built
Tom Beck
up an impressive record, losing 
only to Duquesne Frosh by a 54- 
52 margin. Forquer was a mem
ber of the 1942-43 aggregation 
which posted a 16-4 season record 
and was invited to the National 
Invitational Tournament.
Riehl High Man 
Sophomore Tom Beck has play
ed brilliant ball for the Tartans 
in recent contests and is now sec
ond high in Individual scoring 
with 152 points. Jack Riehl heads 
the scoring with 173, followed by 
Beck, Mike Theodore with 149, 
Tom Craig with 110, Len Bianchi

and Joe Matsey with 58. Riehl 
heads the averages with 11.5 points

Betas, Kappa Sigs Tie 
In Intramural League
Dorm Dukes Lead Federal League; 
Three Teams Tied In American
Table Tennis
Individual table tennis tour
naments are scheduled to get 
underway in the near future. All 
interested persons should con
tact David A. See in the intra
mural office at the gymnasium 
as soon as possible.
Team competition will be 
completed within the next three 
weeks.
Intramural basketball made a* 
quick start with the new semester I 
as twenty-four teams saw action 
Thursday and Friday nights.
In the National league Jim 
Vaux, scoring 24 points, led the 
Betas to their fourth straight vic
tory Friday night as they downed 
a hard fighting SAE five, 49-30. 
The SAEs took an early 2 point 
lead, but the Betas soon moved 
out in front to hold the lead for 
the remainder of the game. The 
Kappa Sigs also scored their 
fourth straight victory as they 
defeated FPHA, 54-41.
The Dorm Dukes took the lead j 
in the Federal league race with ! 
a victory over the Raiders, 34-24. | 
Emanon defeated the TX B 
team, 55-27, for their third vic
tory against no defeats.
Action in the American league 
Thursday night saw the Architects 
swamp the Newman Club five, 
77-17, for their third win of the 
season. Marty Chetlin led the scor
ing with ten field goals for 20 
points.
What is the cause of the sudden change in Carnegies 
basketball fortunes? seems to be the most popular question 
at present in the Plaid camp.
An amazing start netted the Tartans eight wins over such 
highly regarded opposition as Penn State, Lawrence Tech, Ge
neva and the like, while only three opponents were able to 
stop, the local five.
Then followed three defeats in succession to Washington 
and Jefferson, Oberlin and Case Tech, plus an unimpressive 
victory over Allegheny.
This not entirely unexpected lapse into pre-Cratsley form 
in the win and loss column hinges on several key factors which 
have surrounded the Scots.
Most obvious of these is the lack of both opponents and 
practice during the long period from the onset of final exami
nations until the opening of the spring semester.
The long layoff proved to be too much for the Plaid cagers 
to cope with on their Ohio visit, and for a brief period seemed 
to have them' stymied in the Allegheny meeting. The Meadville visitors, however, found themselves in the same situation 
and wound up on the short end of one of the most inaccurate 
shooting displays of the aging season.
Somewhat more obscure is the disadvantage presented by 
the locality of the contests. The three consecutive losses took 
place on the oppositions floors as did two of the three previous 
losses. Only Westminster has been able to stop the Tartans at 
the Skibo gymnasium.
The irregular sizes of basketball courts, the lack of uni
formity in banking boards, and the close contact between the 
players and the usually highly partisan crowds, all give the 
home team a decided advantage.
The extensive list of schools with long victory streaks on 
home courts, many extending over four or more seasons, are 
positive proof of the handicap this presents. Betting circles 
rate the home team a six point favorite, other factors being 
equal.
The prevalence of upsets throughout basketball in general 
still leaves Carnegie stock at a near record high despite the 
i recent deluge of defeats. Even the best of them are stopped 
by underdog opponents and an undefeated season is almost 
unheard of in basketball.
Coach Mel Cratsleys proteges themselves have registered 
four major upsets since last November and have been victim
ized three times themselves.
It is this same unpredictability, which is more spectacu
lar with the Scots than with most college fives, which has made 
the locals a big drawing card regardless of their opposition.
Wednesday night Carnegie will take on a notoriously 
wTeak Thiel squad, but once again the home floor jinx may 
spell trouble before the evening is over. The Tomcats turned 
the tables on the Kilties last year and, as usual, an upset is 
far from out of the question.
On Saturday Coach Adam Saunders, his Wash-Jeff two 
platoon system and all, will move into the Skibo gym in an 
attempt to follow up his previous win over the locals.
In contrast to the first meeting of the two the Plaid will 
now be underdogs, but they will have the home floor and crowd 
working to their advantage.
The Red "and Black will bring with them their two com
plete teams, both of which possess plenty of height and even 
more experience.
The Prexies are a tough nut for any team to crack. Vic
tories over Arizona State, West Virginia and Bethany, among 
others, are evidence of a powerhouse.
If their accuracy is anywhere near that of the first meet
ing of the teams they will be impossible to defeat. The change 
of scenery, however, promises to alter matters quite a bit, 
and a rough and tumble battle seems in the offing.
BETAS ROLL TO FOURTH WIN

Old Jim-Fine Art?...
By Joe Weinrich
I met OLD JIM the day before midsemester vacation began. 
This is one of President Dohertys paintings, I was told. See what 
you can do with it in the way of a critique.
Looking at the picture I resolve not to commit myself. Advice
was needed and I knew just where*
to get it. I went to see a farmer 
friend of mine. Jeff, what do you 
think of this?
A Horse 
Well, I didn't know? He 
scratched his head, What is it? 
A horse, piped I timidly.
A horse! He almost swallow
ed his Mail Pouch. Son, no Chris
tian would ever let a corpse like 
that pull a wagon. Why, theres 
laws aginit. An look at that eye; 
it aint in the right place. He 
went on for hours.
I thought Jeffs comments
might not be artistically correct. 
What I needed was some infallible 
rule I could apply to OLD JIM. 
There were thousands of equations 
in engineering; all I needed was 
one in painting.
Rare Genius 
I found the Rodin (a French 
sculptor) equation; Anyone who 
lives his work is an artist.-1 felt 
this was too general and hunted 
on. I found, Now, in a sense all

what was being said, (Painters 
have grown conscious through 
their sensibility of past cycles that 
the rebirth of an aesthetic voice 
can take life only after a reori

Side View Only
With no sei of standards avail
able I decided to make my own 
rules. I would get a picture of a 
horse (preferably a side view) 
painted by a master. With this as 
a guide I could surely pass judge

ASME Membership Discussed
While there is not an ASME 
Chapter in evening school itself, a 
member of the evening student 
body, Frank Mihelich, is acting as 
a representative for the day group. 
If any student who has been en
rolled as an engineering student in 
evening school, for a minimum of 
four years, and is interested in 
joining this group should contact 
Frank in Machinery Hall library 
any Tuesday or Thursday evening 
from 6:30 to 7:15 p. m.
The student membership fee is 
$3.00 per year, which includes a 
subscription to Mechanical En
gineering, the official journal of 
the society. Although the fiscal 
year of this group begins in Octo
ber, it is not too late to enroll now. 
Members may procure ASME pins 
or watch charms through the Car
negie Tech Chapter.
An immediate valuable asset to 
the new member is the use of the 
Engineering Societies personal 
service and library. In addition, 
special discounts on ASME publi
cations are accorded student mem
bers.
Upon graduation, a student 
member in good standing is eligi
ble for a junior membership in 
ASME. Any evening student eli
gible for ASME membership 
should certainly join this worth
while organization.
