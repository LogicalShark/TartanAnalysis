Famous Warhol collection stolenAustralian Prime Minister Kevin 
Rudd to sneak at CMU for Summit
Tom Sokolowski, director of 
The Warhol museum here in 
Pittsburgh, told the Tribune* Review that Warhol made eight 
prints of the series, and that they 
interested Weisman, a sports 
lover, because he wanted to 
unite the elements of leisure, art, 
and sports.
Weisman, the son of art collec
tors, owns more than one set of 
The Athletes, and brought one 
of them to The Warhol museum 
in Pittsburgh in 2005.
The originals of the other 
sets exist for each image but in 
different colors. According to 
Bloomberg News, Weisman tried 
to sell one of his sets for $28 mil
lion in 2007.
I was always familiar with 
the Campbells soup can painting 
and [Warhols] paintings of simi
lar images with different colors, 
said sophomore business admin
istration major Toro Adeyemi. 
Factory Girl made me find him 
even more interesting. Im not 
shocked someone stole one of his 
paintings, as Im sure it was bril
liant, but I am surprised from the 
lack of respect in the act.

' This week, Carnegie Mellon is 
in the midst of an international 
meeting of the minds as the 
worlds leading economic ex
perts arrive in Pittsburgh. Pitts
burgh will soon host the G20 
Economic Summit, a meeting of 
leaders from 20 of the worlds 
emerging and industrialized 
countries to discuss the need for 
change and cooperation in the 
global economy. In the wake of 
the most recent recession, the 
conference is expected to touch 
on a number of important issues, 
including sources for global 
growth, the role of financial reg
ulation and trade, educating the 
modern workforce, and renew
ing globalization.
The conference will officially 
begin on Thursday and end on 
Friday. Carnegie Mellon will 
host an event prior to the open
ing: a day-long conference on 
Wednesday, sponsored by the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 
the Atlantic Council.

After Los Angeles art collec
tor and businessman Richard L. 
Weisman left his home on Sept.
2, his 10-print series of Warhol 
portraits called The Athletes 
and a Warhol portrait of Weis
man were stolen.
The next day, a domestic 
worker arrived at the home, went 
into the dining room, and upon 
seeing the blank walls called the 
police.
There were no signs of forced 
entry, Los AngeleS Police De
partment detective Don Hrycyk 
told the Pittsburgh Tribu'ne-Review. The only lead police have 
are sightings of a maroon van 
that might have been parked 
nearby.
The Athletes series includes 
portraits of Muhammad Ali, 
Chris Evert, Robert Gilbert, 
Dorothy Hamill, Kareem AbdulJabbar, Jack Nicklaus, Pele, Tom 
Seaver, Willie Shoemaker, and

sioned Warhol, a friend of his, to 
paint The Athletes in 1977.

Warhol was a leading figure 
in the pop art movement. After 
a successful career as a commer
cial illustrator, Warhol became 
famous worldwide for his work 
as a painter, avant-garde film
maker, record producer, author, 
and public figure known for his 
membership in wildly diverse so
cial circles.
Warhol was also a Pittsburgh 
native, and studied commercial 
art at the School of Fine Arts at 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, now Carnegie Mellon.
I think that his art still has a 
big influence on our culture to
day, said Gabrielle Page, a soph
omore biomedical and mechani
cal engineering double major. 
You see it a lot in fashion with 
pop art and bold colors. I think 
that a lot of the usage of bold 
prints and colors comes from his 
influence. Because its so evident 
today, it doesnt surprise me that 
someone would want to steal his 
paintings.
A $1 million reward has been 
offered for information regard
ing the recovery of the stolen col
lection.

As G20 fervor spreads to cam
pus, the Carnegie Mellon com
munity will have the opportu
nity to hear Australian Prime 
Minister Kevin Rudd give a spe
cial keynote address, followed 
by a panel discussion of policy 
experts. The prime ministers ad
dress is scheduled to take place 
on Thursday in Rangos Hall in 
the University Center at 5 p.m. 
Doors open at 4 p.m. to allow 
guests to be seated.
Rudd is the 26th prime min
ister of the Commonwealth of 
Australia and the occupant of the 
countrys most powerful office. 
He also heads the center-left Aus
tralian Labor Party on a federal 
level. After joining the Depart
ment of Foreign Affairs in 1981, 
Rudd pursued his career in for
eign service at posts in the Aus
tralian embassies in Stockholm, 
Sweden and in Beijing, China. 
Throughout his political career, 
Rudd has been on the forefront of 
educational reforms, particularly 
those advocating the importance 
of teaching foreign languages in 
Australian schools.
Rudd is a strong proponent of 
policies related to climate change 
and aims for Australia to demon
strate international leadership 
in this field, according to the cli
mate change plan he describes 
in a video clip on his personal 
website. As stated in The Aus
tralian, the prime minister has 
also established a commission 
for nuclear non-proliferation. He 
looks toward the G20 as a major 
international summit for multi
lateral engagement, as stated in 
the article.
Before flying into Pittsburgh
for the G20 conference, Rudd 
will attend the UN General As
sembly meeting in New York.
The address is expected to 
strengthen Carnegie Mellons 
reputation as an international 
university, as the Carnegie Mel
lon satellite campus in Adelaide, 
Australia houses programs in 
the universitys Heinz College. 
An effort that began almost four 
years ago, the Australian campus 
serves as the universitys Asia Pa
cific education base. It currently 
offers two masters degrees  
the master of science in public 
policy and management and the 
master of science in information 
technology.
As with the speeches of President Barack Obama and former 
Indian president A.P. J. Abdul Kalam given at Carnegie Mellon in 
the past,* Rudds speech is aimed 
at enriching the campus com
munitys experience of hearing a 
head of state talk about interna
tional affairs and policies.
The event is sponsored by 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
the Allegheny Conference on 
Community Development, the 
Pittsburgh Technology Council, 
and the World Affairs Council 
of Pittsburgh, along with the H. 
John Heinz III College, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, Carn
egie Mellon Economics Society, 
and the International Relations 
and Politics Program.

Students named Fulbright Scholars, swine vaccine in demand
Graduates excel in scholarship program
Carnegie Mellon graduates Ally Reeves, 
Gregory Newby, and Julia Stein were re
cently named recipients of the prestigious 
U.S. Student Fulbright Scholarship. The 
Fulbright Scholars Program originated in 
1946 as a way to promote learning among 
the United States and other countries of 
the world.
Reeves graduated in 2008 from the 
masters of fine arts program and plans 
to work in Mumbai, India, with an inter
national organization called Partners for 
Urban Knowledge, Action, and Research 
to create installation art and participate 
in research. Her primary work will con
cern how street vendors were portrayed 
in media from the 19th century to mod
ern times.
Newby, who earned a bachelors degree in 2009 in biological sciences, will 
be researching in the lab of professor 
Andreas Plckthun t the biochemistry 
institute of the University of Zurich in 
Switzerland. The research will focus on 
creating a molecular, fluorescent sensor 
that will monitor protein modifications 
inside living cells, which could help iden
tify new targets for cancer therapy.
A bachelor of humanities and arts 2008 
graduate, Stein will travel to Helsinki, 
Finland to enter the master of arts de
gree program in live art and performance 
studies at the Theatre Academy Helsinki. 
She plans to participate in the production 
of a film with Finnish artist.

Flu season approaches with H1N1
Student Health Services held its 
seasonal flu clinics on Sept! 17 from 
8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the Dowd 
Room and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. 
in Student Health Services. There 
was another clinic scheduled, but the 
turnout to the first clinic was so large 
that Health Services expected to run 
out of the vaccine, and ahnounced 
that the second clinic on Sept. 18 was 
canceled.
In an e-mail sent to the campus 
community, Anita Barkin, director of 
Student Health Services, reassured 
the community that more flu vaccines 
are on order and there will be more 
clinics to come. She also reiterated 
that the seasonal influenza vaccine 
is distinct from the H1N1 vaccine,
which will not be available nation
ally until late October or November, 
as well as encouraging that everyone 
exercise good hygiene habits.
There is no charge for the vaccine if 
one is covered under Carnegie Mellon 
University insurance or Highmark in
surance plans; otherwise the cost is 
$15.
A new single-dose vaccine for the 
H1N1 virus was approved on Sept. 
15, and the vaccines should become 
available next month, according to 
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human 
Services Kathleen Sebelius.

Ferguson suggested that the South 
African experience reveals, in an ex

us to find our way past some of the cur

G20, fromAl
need for international economic 
organizations such as the IMF 
and World Bank to better repre
sent developing countries, and 
approaches to climate change 
policy.
Robert Atkinson, adjunct pro
fessor of marketing in the Tepper 
School of Business and another 
event speaker, wrote in official 
literature for the event about 
the need for economic policy to 
create a new globalization that 
shifts the core economic policies 
of nations from mercantilist, export-led strategies to innovationbased, domestic-growth strate
gies. Branstetter spoke about 
his feelings on the feasibility of 
implementing such policies.
There will be great reluc
tance to swiftly and substantially 
change the regulatory frame
work at a time when public emo
tions are running high but the fi
nancial system remains fragile,
he said. A more likely outcome 
is that the major economies will 
continue [to] push for an over
haul and strengthening of the 
basic regulatory framework un
der which international banks 
are required to operate.
Discussions of the G20 have 
already covered a wide range of 
topics, including education as a 
key component of this new glo
balization. This will be one of the 
main topics of the Carnegie Mel
lon conference.
Countries that can success
fully replicate the U.S. research 
university enterprise will secure 
for themselves a strong position 
for the future, for they will be the 
source of the next wave of eco
nomic expansion in the world, 
wrote Pradeep Khosla, dean of 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology and another of the events 
speakers, in the report published 
for the event.
Decisions made at the Pitts
burgh Summit will be discussed
at future G20 and international 
meetings, such as in the case of 
global warming made by Bran
stetter.
At the end of 2009, in Co
penhagen, there will be a major 
international summit on climate 
change designed to produce a 
successor to the Kyoto Protocol, 
which required all signatory 
states to accept and implement 
significant reductions in their 
greenhouse gas emissions, he 
said. If we ever hope to achieve 
anything meaningful in Copen
hagen, then we need a more 
productive discussion between 
developing and developed coun
tries about a possible compro
mise on climate change.
No matter what comes out of 
the conference, it has been a big 
deal for the city of Pittsburgh. 
The city has spent $34 million 
in preparation, according to the 
Post-Gazette, and has been sin
gled out in a White House press 
report as being chosen for its
commitment to employing new 
and green technology to further 
economic recovery and develop
ment.
According to Branstetter, the 
conference itself is an achieve
ment.
I think that institutionalizing 
this regular high-level exchange 
between developed and develop
ing countries is more important 
than the substance that gets is
sued at the end of each summit, 
he said.
A full schedule of events held 
throughout Pittsburgh can be 
found at pittsburghg20.org. 
Events will take place through
out the week in preparation for 
the official summit opening on 
Thursday.

Heart-lung machine 
helps H1N1 patients
According to a study con
ducted in England, running 
blood through a heart-lung ma
chine may be more helpful for 
treating swine flu patients than 
putting them on a ventilator. 
The method of delivering oxy
gen to blood through microfi
bers, a process called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 
can be used to care for swine flu 
patients.
Not putting patients on a ven
tilator gives their lungs a chance 
to rest, since more air is not be
ing forced into them. The re
searchers involved in the study 
believe that the new method 
would be especially helpful for 
young flu patients with previ
ously healthy lungs.

Bacteria found on 
showerheads
A new study says that poten
tially disease-causing germs 
can get trapped in showerheads 
and grow into biofilm or coats 
of slime that deliver a bacteria 
blast along with hot water.
Levels of these bacteria are 
more than 100-fold higher 
than levels found in the pre
shower water, according to the 
researchers, who analyzed the 
germs in the biofilm of 45 show
erheads from nine U.S. cities.
Since most of the germs are 
harmless, however, this find
ing does not pose a threat to 
healthy people with function
ing immune systems.
Nonetheless, experts recom
mend changing the showerhead 
once a year or more frequently, 
like they do in hospitals, to pre
vent mineral deposits and bio
film.

Standards for robotic 
surgery to be set
Increasing numbers of sur
geons are using high-tech ro
botic equipment to operate on 
patients with prostate cancer 
and other conditions, but some 
medical authorities worry about 
inadequate training for using 
this new equipment.
Although the rate of failure 
of robot-assisted surgeries is 
similar to that of traditional 
surgeries, such procedures can 
be more risky if inexperienced 
surgeons work with the robots.
Currently, there is no system 
to test a surgeons competency 
with robots, and surgeons can
not practice on simulators be
fore working with live patients.
The issue of standards will 
be addressed at next months 
World Congress of Endourology 
in Munich. The American Urol
ogy Association will consider 
the recommendations.

Swine flu vaccine to 
be given as a spray
The swine flu vaccine might 
first be administered as a nasal 
spray, said Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention officials. 
The nasal spray, called FluMist, 
is is approved only for healthy 
people ages 2 to 49 years.
It is not recommended for 
some of the people who are 
most in danger of severe swine 
flu complications. These include 
pregnant women, children 
younger than 2, and people 
with asthma and other chronic 
respiratory diseases.
The nasal spray vaccine is 
made from a live yet weakened 
strain of the swine flu virus, in 
contrast to the normal shot vac
cines, which are made from the 
killed flu virus.

and leave us limited in our activi
ties.
Diseases of the eyes are nu
merous and have many causes; 
for example, people with diabe
tes may develop diabetic retin
opathy in which blood vessels in 
their retina are damaged. This 
may cause blood to leak into the 
eye, blurring and blotting vi
sion, causing a condition known 
as macular edema. Fortunately, 
we live in an age of expanding 
knowledge and collaboration in 
robotics, medicine, and surgery. 
It is because of these diseases 
that many of todays leading re
searchers and robotics scientists 
are motivated by robotic sur
gery. One such scientist is Brian 
Becker, a current Ph.D. student at 
Carnegie Mellon working in the 
field of robotic surgery. Becker is 
currently working on the Micron 
project under his adviser, Cam
eron Riviere.
Micron, designed by staff en
gineer Robert MacLachlan, is 
a handheld, pen-shaped device 
used in robotic eye surgery that 
is planned for use with retinal 
surgery therapy.
While a person holds it
Micron compensates for tremor 
to increase the accuracy of surgi
cal movements.
Micron will be used in laser 
photocoagulation, which is a 
process in which heat from a la
ser is used to seal blood vessels 
that may be leaking or abnormal. 
The treatment may completely 
seal blood vessels on the retina, 
or it may slow the growth of new 
abnormal blood vessels. Thus, 
Micron will be able to treat dis
eases such as diabetic retinopa
thy. Micron is attached to sen
sory equipment that will be used 
in the application of laser burns. 
As Becker explained, there are 
motors between the handle grip 
and the end tip, and its position 
will be tracked with high-speed 
optical tracking from stereo cam
eras mounted on a microscope. 
Micron will thus be able to track 
its own movements so as to ap
ply the burn to the correct place, 
correct for hand tremor, and sta
bilize the instrument. Becker ex
plains the benefits of such an ad
vanced technology: The Micron 
concept can be used to place laser 
burns accurately, inject medicine 
into veins, avoid accidentally 
bumping into delicate tissue, and 
increase precision of operations 
by scaling 
down
movement within the work
space. The surgeon exerts macro 
control while Micron aids in the 
micro movements.
Minimizing tremor has al
ways been desired during medi
cal procedures. Micron differs 
from other devices because it is 
cheaper, and leaves the surgeon 
in full macro control of the de
vice. Other devices developed 
require more extensive training, 
are less intuitive, and cost over a 
hundred times more. Tests have 
already been performed with Mi
cron, using a seven-by-seven grid 
of squares 650 microns apart 
(about a quarter of a penny in 
size), and Micron was noticeably 
faster and more accurate than 
the manual process.
Most of our existing experi
ments have centered around sim
ple tasks such as pointing, trac
ing, and other basic movements 
used in surgery. In these tasks 
we have shown roughly 20 per
cent improvement in accuracy, 
Becker said.
In the future, the group plans 
to test Micron on real 
animal eyes.
Micron is still in its develop
mental stages, but it has a bright 
future. Becker, who is research
ing the control of Micron in use
ful ways, would like to expand 
the usefulness of the instrument. 
Currently, Micron is adept at ac
curacy in a small area; Becker 
wants to expand its range of mo
tion to handle larger tasks, such 
as over a thousand accurate la
ser burns and a greater speed of 
operation. He hopes to achieve 
other goals for Micron, includ
ing the ability to inject medicine 
into tiny retinal veins, and to 
expand its scope into more than 
just retinal surgical procedures. 
Micron was developed to benefit 
medical science. Becker revealed 
his optimistic outlook on the de
vices future, saying, It is sup
posed to be as interchangeable as 
possible with existing equipment 
and procedures, yet superior in 
existing approaches by provid
ing increased accuracy to enable 
procedures that are today con
sidered impossible.
like a 
pen, it has
a small tip that can move in 
three dimensions. Using sta
bilization software, the device 
can minimize unwanted hand 
movements, or tremor, caused 
by natural hand unsteadiness.
Everybody has a little bit of 
tremor in their hands, Becker 
said. However, microsur
geons often deal with struc
tures that are as tiny as the 
diameter of a human hair or 
even smaller. A system such as
Pictured above is Micron, a device 
that can improve the precision 
during eye surgeries. Micron is 
being developed by Brian Becker, 
a Ph.D. student at Carnegie

Local stylists invention leads to less strain for haircuts

Enrico Bellisario, a hair stylist in Oakland, uses Shearfuzion to style hair. 
Shearfuzion helps hair stylists cut hair with ease and helps reduce the 
symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.
DAVID HUANG
Staffwriter
While many might complain 
about the amount of money spent 
for something as trivial as a hair
cut, the hair stylist might actu
ally be paying more. Stylists are 
at high risk of developing carpal 
tunnel syndrome due to repeti
tive hand motion accompanied 
by the high tension between the 
nerves of their fingers from using
the scissors. However, local Oak
land barber Enrico Bellisario has 
come up with an invention that 
could help alleviate symptoms of 
carpal tunnel syndrome.
Bellisario, the owner of Enri
cos Haircutting for Men, located 
on Fifth Avenue, once suffered 
severely from carpal tunnel syn
drome. Carpal tunnel syndrome 
(CTS) is a medical condition in 
which the median nerve that runs 
from the forearm into the hand 
becomes pressed or squeezed at 
the wrist. One of the most vital 
functions of the median nerve is 
to control the impulses to small 
muscles in the hand that enable 
the fingers and thumb to move 
freely.
The carpal tunnel is the nar
row channel of ligament and 
bones at the base of the hand 
that houses t-he median nerve. 
CTS often leads to a sensations 
of tingling, pricking, numbness, 
and muscle weakness in the 
hand. Most people who have this 
syndrome usually experience the 
symptoms gradually over time.
Early stages of CTS include 
frequent burning, tingling, and 
numbness in the palm and spe
cific fingers, such as the thumb 
and index finger.
These symptoms usually ap
pear during the night, since many 
people tend to bend their wrists 
when they sleep, which applies 
even more pressure to the carpal 
tunnel. People diagnosed with 
this syndrome may also have the 
urge to shake out their hands 
or wrists.
In later stages of CTS, the 
symptoms may occur during both 
the day and night. In addition, 
decreased grip strength results 
in difficulty grabbing things. 
Therefore, patients might notice 
increased incidents of dropping 
objects.
Bellisario noticed that CTS 
was a major hindrance for all 
hairstylists, including himself.
In the past, cutting peoples hair 
using the ordinary scissor-comb 
switching method would cause 
extreme tension in his hands.
It was then that he came up 
with an invention that combined 
the scissor and the comb. After 
searching for three years, he fi
nally found a Taiwanese manu
facturer who could carry out his 
idea by using injection molding 
to attach the comb teeth to the 
scissors.
According to an article in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, his in
vention won a silver medal in the 
personal care product category 
at the InventHelps INPEX inven
tors show in June 2008, trailing 
only the Diamond Shades LongLasting Fragrant Face Mask by 
a Taiwanese inventor. Shearfuz
ion, the name of the final prod
uct, allows Bellisario to save an 
average of five minutes on each 
customer.
Using Shearfuzion, he stated, 
There is no switching. You see, 
in the past, you comb, switch 
hands, and then cut. Now, you 
comb and then cut. Also, his in
vention eases strain in the wrist 
and palm. I was able to start cut
ting peoples hair again in a mere 
few days after getting better 
from my CTS syndromes. Usu
ally it takes weeks to do that, he 
said.
Shearfuzion is not only for pro
fessional stylists; it was designed 
to be easy for everyone to use.
I know a lot of students who 
like to trim their hair from time 
to time, not to mention wives who 
love to cut their husbands hair, 
Bellisario said. Now they dont 
have to worry about messing up 
their hair by cutting it too deep. 
And they can save huge time and 
money from going to a haircut 
place just to get a little trim for 
their date or interviews!

Although many are excited 
about this new technology, some 
are worried about the large cost

Researchers use 
algae as oil source ,
A team of researchers from In-, 
dia are looking into using a type 
of single-celled algae, called 
diatoms, to produce biofuel. 
These genetically engineered 
diatoms contain droplets of oil 
inside them and consume them 
when food sources are scarce. 
Since the diatoms produce oil 
on exposure to sunlight, the re
searchers have proposed build
ing a solar panel consisting of 
just diatoms that can be used to 
make this oil.
The substance makes up 
nearly a quarter of the algaes 
mass.
Some believe more fossil fuel 
resources must be directed to
ward the project, while others 
assert that sunlight and cheap 
materials make the project a big 
possibility.

The LI, a diesel hybrid car de
signed by Volkswagen, made its 
debut at a Frankfurt auto show 
last Wednesday. Weighing 900 
pounds and getting 170 miles 
per gallon, the car is designed 
to look and be built to consume 
as little energy as possible, say 
the engineers behind the LI.
The fuel tank holds 1.7 gal

exterior body that is similar to 
Formula 1 and aerospace tech
nologies only adds to the versa

When asked about the future 
of the LI, the company claimed 
that mass production of the car

Arctic melting 
slower than believed
Scientists at the U.S. Na
tional Snow and Ice Data Center 
(NSIDC) have determined that 
the annual summer melting of 
the Arctic Sea ice has not been 
as dramatic as it has been in the 
past.
The most likely cause for the 
reduction was the dispersion of 
ice by arctic winds and globally 
cooler temperatures. NSIDC sci
entist Walt Meier states that the 
latter was due to cloudier con
ditions and low pressure zones 
in late summer.
Despite the new data, scien
tists maintain that the long
term trend has continued to 
indicate a rise in temperatures. 
Especially alarming is the pres
ence of thin new ice lying on top 
of the older, thicker ice.

How Things Work: Nanoparticle-based memory
Your money, all in one place. 
And not all over the place.
ZAHCHARIAS GEORGE
Junior Staffwriter
Modern hard disk drives last a 
few years before they have to be 
discarded  they are plagued by 
mechanical failures that can oc
cur anywhere between two and 
six years into their lives. Solid 
state drives offer some consola
tion in that the amount of time 
they can store data is approxi
mately 2400 years if handled 
carefully, according to a paper 
published by Imation Corp. How
ever, for those among us who 
would need to store data for over 
a billion years, we would prob
ably have to resort to nanopar
ticle-based non-volatile memory.
Of the many nanomaterials, 
carbon nanotubes have attracted 
the most attention, and not with
out cause. Carbon nanotubes are 
tubes made of interconnected 
carbon atoms.
They may be single-walled, 
made of a single layer of carbon 
atoms, or they could be multi
walled, with multiple layers 
forming the tube. These nano
tubes possess many properties 
that set them apart from most 
materials on the nano, micro, 
and macro scales.
Carbon nanotubes are the 
strongest and stiffest materials 
known today, and certain forms 
of these nanotubes are capable 
of conducting electricity. It is 
mainly on account of these two 
properties that carbon nano
tubes are used in nanoparticlebased memory.
Digital data is stored  and 
processed  in binary digits, 
known as bits. These bits can 
be thought of as the states of a 
switch; they can be on or off. 
In nanoparticle-based memory, 
the basic idea is to shuttle a nano
particle (made of a metal like 
silver or iron) between the two
ends of a multi-walled carbon 
nanotube. Usually, one end of 
the tube is considered to be at a 
certain logic level zero while the 
other end is the logic level one. 
The position of the shuttle within 
the nanotube, therefore, simu
lates the same states of on and 
off, and if the shuttle position 
can be frozen, the system will 
function as non-volatile memory. 
Non-volatile memory is capable 
of storing data even when the 
power supply is removed.
Writing data into this sort 
of memory is to simply position 
the shuttle in one of the differ
ent predefined regions. Particle 
motion within the nanotube is 
brought about by flowing a cur
rent through the device. The 
direction of motion can be re
versed by reversing the direction 
of supplied current.
The speed of the particle as it 
travels along the tube is deter
mined by the magnitude of the 
voltage applied across the ends 
of the tube. It follows that by re
ducing the supplied current to 
zero, the position of the shuttle 
can be fixed at some point within 
the tube.
The solid state physics group 
at the University of California 
at Berkeley, led by Alex Zettl, 
noticed that the electrical resis
tance offered by the nanotubes 
varies with the position of the 
particle, making it possible to 
locate the particle  with rea
sonable accuracy  by simply 
measuring the resistance along 
the tube. This is how the written 
data is then read.
The nanotubes are sealed at 
both ends with electrodes, and 
these electrodes provide the 
shuttle with the current neces
sary for shuttle motion or posi
tioning.
At the nano scale, friction is 
negligible and the friction of
Health Talk: Cystic fibrosis
HEATHER TOMKO
Forum Editor
In the past few decades, rapid 
advances in technology have 
led to corresponding advances 
in medicine, which have then 
resulted in exponentially bet
ter treatment for people with 
diseases that had earlier been a 
certain death sentence.
One such disease is Cystic Fi
brosis (CF); only a little more 
than 50 years ago, this diag
nosis, according to the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundations website, 
was a fatal sentence for the child 
who was diagnosed before he or 
she even reached elementary 
school. Now the median age of 
a person with CF is more than
37 years, a clear improvement 
over only a half century ago. CF 
is an inherited respiratory dis
ease that results in thick, sticky 
mucus secretions in the respira
tory and digestive tracts and the 
reproductive system and causes 
an increase in the amount of salt 
in sweat.
These symptoms are due to a 
defective gene that alters a pro
tein that controls the normal 
movement of sodium chloride, 
or table salt, into and out of the 
cells. This gene is recessive, 
which means that a child must 
inherit it from both their mother 
and father in order to have CF; 
if they receive only one copy of 
the gene, they will not develop 
the disease, but there will be 
the possibility that they pass the 
gene on to their own child.
The main characteristic of CF 
is the thick secretions that are 
produced. In healthy people, 
the cells that produce mucus, 
sweat, saliva, and digestive 
juices produce thin, slippery se
cretions that act as lubricants. 
For people with CF, however, 
the thicker secretions actually 
plug up tubes in the pancreas 
and lungs, which results in fre
quent respiratory infections. In 
addition, the secretions stop the 
body from absorbing important 
vitamins by blocking pancreatic 
enzymes that aid in the diges
tion of fats and proteins.
Common respiratory infec
tions experienced by patients 
with CF are bronchitis, pneu
monia, and chronic sinusitis; 
asthma can also result. The re
spiratory infections occur so of
ten for people with CF because 
the thick mucus that is secreted 
blocks the airways, and is also 
the perfect breeding ground for 
the bacteria that cause these 
infections. In addition to respi
ratory infections, respiratory 
failure can also result, as can a 
collapsed lung. With a collapsed
lung, a small hole forms in the 
lungs outer layer which leads to 
air leaking into the chest cavity. 
It is ultimately respiratory prob
lems that prove fatal for those 
with CF.
Though respiratory issues are 
common for CF patients, they 
are not the only symptoms of 
the disease. The thick secretions 
that block the airways and lead 
to respiratory infections also 
block the ducts of the pancreas, 
which stops enzymes that digest 
fat and proteins from reach
ing the stomach. This keeps the 
body from absorbing vitamins 
A, D, E, and K, resulting in se
vere nutritional deficiencies.
People with CF also often 
develop cystic fibrosis-related 
diabetes, because the pancreas 
controls the level of blood sugar 
and the ducts of the pancreas 
are often covered. The bile duct, 
which takes bile from the liver 
and gallbladder to the small in
testine, can also be blocked by 
the secretions, leading to liver 
problems such as cirrhosis.
Cystic fibrosis can also cause 
reproductive problems in both 
men and women, though treat
ment options are available for 
both that can make it possible for 
some people to have children. As 
explained on MayoClinic.com, a 
number of treatments exist to 
help patients with CF live with 
the disease, though there is cur
rently no cure.
Antibiotics are used to treat 
the bacteria that cause the re
spiratory infections. Mucus 
thinning drugs can also help, 
because the thinner mucus is 
easier to cough up. Bronchodilators are also used; medicines 
such as albuterol help to open 
the bronchial tubes and clear 
the thick secretions.
Oral enzymes are often 
taken to help patients maintain 
weight, as people with CF often 
need more calories than healthy 
people do. For those with persis
tent, severe, and life-threaten
ing respiratory problems, a lung 
transplant may be suggested, 
though due to the serious risks 
that accompany this procedure, 
it is often a last option.
Though no cure exists for CF 
presently, the genetic mutation 
that causes the disease has been 
identified, and scientists have 
been looking for ways to put cop
ies of the healthy gene into the 
patients respiratory tract; clini
cal trials are being done to test 
the reliability and effectiveness 
of using modified viruses, fat 
capsules, and synthetic vectors. 
In addition, testing has been de
veloped to check if a person is a 
carrier of the CF gene.

LEADING THE WAY
fered by the nanotube to the 
shuttle will be so trivial that 
no mechanical damage will be 
caused during particle move
ment.
Unlike hard disk drives, the 
mechanical components in this 
memory will not, in theory, fail. 
Furthermore, this lack of friction 
allows for an unlimited number 
of write/rewrite processes, un
like solid state drives that be
come unreliable after a certain 
number of write processes.
Zettls group has shown that 
data can be stored for longer 
than a billion years using this 
method of storage.
The nanotubes are protected, 
as they are hermetically sealed 
by the two electrodes, and this 
prevents contamination and pos
sible loss of data.
They also claim that compared 
to modern data storage systems, 
more data can be stored per area 
of storage material used.
While todays state-of-the-art 
hard disk drives can store ap
proximately 200 gigabits (200 
billion bits) per square inch, it 
is believed that this proposed 
method can increase data densi
ties to around 1000 gigabits per 
square inch.
So far, only small numbers 
of such carbon nanotubes have 
been assembled in order to test 
these data storage capabilities. 
These numbers have not been 
large enough to warrant mass 
production.
However, they do prove that 
this model works, and can be 
implemented with good results. 
It could well be quite a few years 
before this goes into produc
tion, quite possibly more than a 
decade before this system is per
fected. Until then, we will have 
to wait, and while doing so, back 
up our digital dat on solid state 
drives.

AMANDA COLE
By now, most people are aware that 
employers scour the Internet looking for 
information about their potential em
ployees, but that does not seem to stop 
anyone from using social networking or 
blogging sites.
Recently, some lawyers have come 
under fire for their blog posts criticizing 
judges or revealing privileged informa
tion about a case. The authors of these 
posts are receiving disciplinary action, 
including fines and even a loss of the 
right to practice law.
While these two situations are differ
ent, and criticizing a judge in no way 
equates with revealing secret information 
about a case, the responses of the courts 
and the bar were extreme and seem to 
violate the First Amendment. A New 
York Times article discussing the issue 
states that because the criticisms were 
not aimed at a problem with the court 
system, they were not covered under the 
First Amendment, and it is stated that 
members of the court system (including 
lawyers and judges) lose their full right 
to criticize that system.
What seems strange to me is that there 
are not better protections under the First 
Amendment. Does working for the gov
ernment mean you should never be able 
to criticize it? I dont think so.
Dissatisfaction at work is nothing new, 
and as long as people have jobs, they 
will criticize them. Whether people com
plain through speaking or writing, their 
thoughts should be protected under the 
First Amendment. If an attorney thinks 
that a judges actions are unfair, he or she 
should have every right to criticize them, 
whether in a formal setting or in a blog.
Blogs are a form of journalism, and 
in journalism, it is perfectly legitimate 
to voice concerns as long as there is evi
dence to back it up; in one of the cases 
in the New York Times article, an attorney
complained that the judge in question 
gave defense attorneys three fewer weeks 
to prepare their cases than other judges. 
This is a substantiated claim, and there is 
no reason to say that this should not be 
protected under the First Amendment.
This is not to say, however, that every
thing should be protected under the First 
Amendment, as in the case of the attor
ney who blogged about her cases*
Attorneys, much like doctors, are re
quired to keep information told to them 
by their clients private. Anything said 
behind closed doors should never be 
revealed, except by the person whose 
secrets they are to tell. That means that 
they should not be revealed in blogs.
Blogs are a great means of express
ing ones thoughts, but they should not 
be used to give away information that 
should be kept secret. In addition, opin
ions about whether clients are guilty or 
innocent should not be written in blogs; 
these sorts of mistakes can lead to prob
lems and repercussions for clients.
It is important to remember that while 
our freedom of speech allows us to say 
many things, some things, like other peo
ples secrets, should be left unsaid and 
unwritten.
This is not the case for complaints 
about employers or coworkers, however, 
and these things should be protected un
der the First Amendment as long as they 
do not contain false information. Reveal
ing true information that can be backed 
up by facts is one thing; making up infor
mation just to make someone look bad is 
another thing entirely.
Until the government passes legislation 
forbidding employers to use things that 
employees  or potential employees  
say or write against them, however, the 
best thing to do is not to post anything 
online that they would not want to see 
on the front page of a newspaper**- or at 
least add some kind of protection to limit 
who can see it.

Evidence in Mumbai terrorism 
case should lead to convictions
[cut
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
My home is a mere three hours away 
from Mumbai, and I have many relatives 
living there. The terror attacks that hap
pened in November of last year rattled 
me. When I went back home that year 
during winter break, I realized the gen
eral sentiments of people  they were 
upset, and mostly at the government. In 
fact, the peoples anger led to the chief 
minister of Maharashtras resignation. I 
felt then that the government would try 
its best to get back into the peoples good 
books. For some time, it did feel like the 
government was trying to speed up the 
investigation, and that the court case of 
the sole captured gunman, Ajmal Kasab, 
was progressing quickly. Investigations 
led to the mapping out of how the terror
ists entered the country and also to the 
narrowing down on the group respon
sible for the attack.
However, things seemed to come to a 
halt. Kasab confessed in court to having 
been a part of the attack, but the court 
decided that it needed more evidence to 
sentence him. Last week, Pakistan agreed 
to charge the seven suspects in the case, 
but also said that it would need more evi
dence to charge the leader of the banned 
Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was held 
primarily responsible for the attacks.
Both these instances amaze me. In July, 
Kasab confessed to having opened fire on
crowds in Mumbai and described details 
of the planning of the attack. He also de
scribed how he trained with the Lashkare-Taiba. Apparently, having thousands 
of people see someone carry a gun and 
shoot indiscriminately in broad daylight 
is not enough evidence. Having this gun
man confess that he was involved in the 
attacks is not enough evidence against 
him. Having Kasab name the Lashkar-eTaiba in his statements is not enough evi
dence against their leader. I understand 
that the courts want to be thorough and 
carry out a complete investigation of the 
matter, but I wonder how much more 
evidence they will ask for, and more im
portantly, how much more evidence they 
will get. I believe there really is not much 
more that can be learned.
Though it has been nearly a year since 
the terror attacks took place, the news 
never seems to change. I have grown 
tired of reading the same things again 
and again. People back home have grown 
accustomed to picking up the newspaper, 
shaking their heads, and putting.it back 
down. The consensus seems to be that 
the case will remain frozen like this for 
a very long time. However, I wish that all 
those involved with making decisions in 
this aspect would realize that they are 
playing with the emotions of millions of 
people, many of whom have lost much at

University involving campus in many G20 events
By now youve heard, probably many 
times, about the G20 Summits rapid ap
proach and the numerous events that are 
coming along with it, as well as the addi
tional security and closings. The number 
of Official Communications e-mails con
cerning the G20 and G20-related events 
on Carnegie Mellons campus now rivals 
the number we received about the swine 
flu when the scare was at its height.
Not only is the university keeping the 
student body informed of what is going 
on with the summit and the city, it is 
making a visible effort to involve Carn
egie Mellon students in as much of the
Summit as possible. In addition to the 
Official Communications e-mails, there 
is also a website that can be accessed de
tailing the numerous events scheduled 
related to the summit, both on campus 
and in the city, at www.cmu.edu/g20.
And the events really are numerous
 there was an expert preview panel 
composed of a number of distinguished 
Carnegie Mellon professors, and a G20 
Awareness Fair was held for students 
this past week. Still to come are a media 
panel, discussions hosted by the Peoples 
Summit, and, of course, the keynote ad
dress by Kevin Rudd, prime minister of
the Commonwealth of Australia.
We appreciate that the university is 
making such an effort to keep Carnegie 
Mellon and its students so involved in 
the happenings of the G20 in the city. An 
event of this importance has the poten
tial to alienate those in the city not direct
ly involved in the conference, especially 
with the added security measures that 
the summit is bringing with it.
We are glad that the administration is 
taking measures to keep that from hap
pening and is instead being proactive 
and involving the student body in what
ever ways are possible.

Spray chalk detracts from look of campus
Over the past few weeks, weve seen a 
multitude of displays advertising extra
curricular groups all over campus as they 
gear up for recruitment. Information 
sessions are noted on the sidewalk from 
Forbes Avenue past the Purnell Center 
for the Arts, promises of free pizza  and 
information about us!  dance across 
the ground outside of Kirr Commons, 
and reasons to go Greek are scattered 
around the Fence.
This type of group effort and extracur
ricular spirit is great, and a nice change 
from the normally pervasive apathy in 
which our campus is shrouded for the 
colder months of the year. But the way 
in which some of this information is be
ing conveyed  through spray chalk  is 
questionable at best.
Messages to join a sorority and go
Greek were spray-chalked on sidewalk 
surfaces from outside Resnik Hall and 
West Wing, past the University Center, 
and going toward Doherty, Baker, and 
Porter Halls, accompanied by spraychalked stencils of the go Greek logo.
These messages elicited normally 
chalked replies to sororities about their 
use of spray chalk. While its use is cur
rently not explicitly prohibited, Student 
Senate has just approved a resolution 
against the spray chalk on campus.
While chalking  or really any type of 
advertising for recruitment for a Greek 
organization, buggy team, or cross-cultural alliance  is fun and important for 
a groups continued membership, orga
nizations should remember that spray 
chalking is semi-permanent. Advertising 
for an information session scheduled to
happen in two days when spray chalk can 
last up to two weeks renders the informa
tion useless and ties up the space for any 
future advertising.
Moreover, with both Bill Gates vis
it and the G20 happening on or near 
campus this week, leftover spray chalk 
smudged across prominent sidewalk ar
eas and the sides of buildings could look 
sloppy and distracting.
Maybe we need a more efficient way 
of recruiting for student organizations 
and advertising for that recruitment on 
campus. Or, better, we need to use the re
sources that are already available. Chalk 
for short-term events  where the rain 
can wash away the message  but hang 
a sign over the entrance to Doherty or 
poster the bulletin boards in the Univer
sity Center for more permanent notices.
Obamas leaked comment breach of integrity
According to ABC, President Obama 
has dipped his toes into pop culture. Last 
week, after Kanye West rudely stole the 
microphone from innocent little Taylor 
Swift after she won her first VMA, the 
President reportedly called the hip hop 
star a jackass.
Was it justified? Probably. Obama was 
simply providing a reason for why a fa
mous rap star would make a perfectly 
nice little girl cry. And no one, except 
maybe Kanye himself, seems to be par
ticularly enraged about this comment, as 
the interruption was clearly rude.
Obama spoke like a normal person 
would have. However, normal people 
do not have to represent their country. 
He realized this, and so he followed his 
statement with a comment intended to
cover his own tail, asking reporters to 
cut the President some slack... Ive got a 
lot of other stuff on my plate.
But why should he have needed to 
cover his actions? Obama was in a closed 
session with reporters talking off the 
record. That record includes the Twit
ter record for journalist Terry Moran, 
who posted the comment, which spread 
across the Internet possibly faster than 
Kanyes original comments and the suc
cessive Internet meme. ABC has since of
fered an official apology for their breach 
of journalistic integrity, posting a com
ment that discusses the expectations of 
privacy involved in an off-the-record ses
sion.
For journalists to maintain the respect 
that they once held, they need to adhere
to the values of the profession. Conversa
tions that are off the record should stay 
as such to maintain a level of trust and 
a rapport that would be impossible oth
erwise. While the future of traditional 
journalism seems uncertain, breaches 
like this one can only further erode what 
remains.
This erosion is already being multiplied 
by blogs like TMZ, which first published 
the entire audio clip of Obamas com
ments, and then later posted the video. 
The record was clearly running.
The question that comes out of all this 
is whether off-the-record conversations 
can continue to exist, or if they are just 
one piece of the multi-faceted journal
istic tradition that is being killed by our 
new, pervasive digital world.

Wests actions will not take away from popularity
CHRISTOPHER JARRETT
Yo*should know that you have 
messed up when the President 
of the United States calls you a 
jackass. America quickly con
demned Kanye Wests actions 
fromthe moment he grabbed 
the microphone from a trembling 
19-year-old pop-country singer, 
Taylor Swift. While many people 
in the media have extensively dis
cussed Wests actions, President 
Obama stated the events most 
eloquently: he was a jackass. He 
messed up.
With that distinction out of 
the way, what do we do now? Do 
vVe just forgive him, or do we de
cide to boycott his music? West 
deserves neither to be crucified 
nor defended. The importance 
lies within realizing what we as 
Americans value.
Thiswas not Wests first dabble 
in immaturity. I still remember 
when Tie uttered, George Bush 
doesn't care about black people. 
America didnt prevent his rise to 
the top then, arid it wont now. 
He is entrenched in our culture. 
His mUsic has the ability to move 
us; his lyrics to reach our spiritu
al selves. He will be considered a 
jackass, but the American peo
ple will put his food on the table 
without problem.
The recent release of 808s and 
Heartbreak revealed the more 
melancholy aspect of Wests per
sonality. In the past, he perceived 
himself as a slandered saint while 
ranting about various offenses, 
but this newest outburst has had 
a different effect on him. Merely 
a day fter the MTV awards, West 
was tine instant away from burst
ing out in tears during an inter
view with Jay Leno in front of a 
national audience.
Despite his repentance, he 
clearly deserves rebuke for his 
actions. Countless YouTube 
comments  often noted as the 
paragon of intellectual human 
discourse  advocate knee-jerk 
reactions. There were calls for 
boycotts, and people slammed his 
credibility as an artist. A complete 
knee-jerk reaction leads down a 
perilous path. He didnt commit a 
crime. He simply violated an un
spoken set of traditional Ameri
can Values.
Should we boycott Serena Wil
liams for her actions in the U.S. 
Open? Must we revoke Michael 
Vicks license? If we disassoci
ate America with West, then we 
should also revoke McEnroes 
membership to the Tennis Hall Of 
Fame.
I dont mean to defend West; 
rather, I would like to note that 
arts worth is not dependent upon 
the artists public persona, much 
like a great novel isnt depen
dent upon the personality of the 
author. Swift is the unfortunate 
victim of a depraved violation of 
traditional American values, but 
America will forgive Kanye West. 
People will buy his albums, DJs 
will play his music in clubs, and 
people will.go to his concerts (he 
just announced a world tour with 
Lady GaGa).
Wests rap in Jay-Zs new sin
gle, Run This Town, interest
ingly runs surprisingly parallel to 
this cultural event. During Wests 
performance of the song on Jay 
Leno, he awkwardly squeaks out 
the first two lines, its crazy how 
you can go from Joe Blow/To ev
erybody on your dick, no homo. 
He regains some swagger and re
alizes the consequences of fame,
asking for please no photos. 
Fame isn't simply being on top 
of the world. It comes with re
sponsibilities to follow unspoken 
American values.
The pivotal line is then inter
jected: This is the life that ev, erybody ask for. West has lived 
through the most extreme highs 
and lows that America can offer. 
His musical ability places him 
within a select group of extreme
ly iconic people within Americas 
history, and his public persona 
has continually been defined by 
his inability to adapt to tradition
al American values.
West is both a jackass and an 
extremely talented person  no 
one would deny him either of 
these descriptions. In the even
tuality of Wests return to the top 
of the charts, American history 
will repeat itself. We are a group
of people made up of various 
dishonorable qualities. We all 
do wrong sometimes. American 
society attempts to perpetuate its 
traditional values. Those that vi
olate them are rebuked, but with 
time are forgiven and allowed to 
rejoin the community.
Christopher Jarrett (cjarrett@J 
realizes that even he is a jackass 
sometimes.

Barbie Fashionista trivializes fashion, girls ambitions
_________HEATHER TOMKO_________
I know Ive written about Bar-i *bie and her involvement in fash
ion before, when she (technically, 
Mattel*) had her own fashion show 
during New Yorks Fashion Week. 
But Mattel has recently released 
a video to promote their new 
Barbie Fashionista line that has 
Caused me to bring up our favor
ite plstic friend once again.
If ytmre a child of the 90s and 
listerid to any pop music dur
ing ytiur childhood at all, you 
likelyknow Aquas famous  or 
infanttius  song Barbie Girl. 
Thogh the song was catchy with 
its witty and easy-to-learn (and 
thus, easy to sing along to) lyrics, 
it perhaps did not cast the best 
light on Mattel and Barbie. Lines 
like You can brush my hair/ Un
dress me everywhere and Come 
on Brbie, lets go party, espe
cially with the latter voiced by 
the sexy-voiced supposed Ken, do 
not exactly leave Barbie with the 
innocnt, girl-next-door persona 
that the doll began with.
And Mattel agreed. In fact, the 
company actually sued Aqua over 
the song in 1997; a Rolling Stone 
article states that Mattel claimed 
that the song contains lyrics that 
associate sexual and other unsa
vory themes with Mattels Barbie 
products.
Mattel, however, has since 
changed their tune (pun intend
ed) and is embracing the song 
wholeheartedly by using it as the 
theme song of their commercialslash-music-video for their new 
line, Barbie Fashionista. They 
have changed the lyrics, which 
now contain phrases like Ive got 
lots of friends, the party never 
ends and begins with a conver
sation between, again, a sexy, 
low-voiced Ken doll and a highpitched, squeal-y Barbie doll that 
concludes with some rather ques
tionable pelvic thrusts from Ken.
And the video doesnt feature 
only the plastic dolls themselves; 
instead, real-life versions of Bar
bie and Ken can be seen, with the 
former wearing tight shirts and 
skirts so short that Im afraid that 
while theyre doing the Barbie 
dance during the video theyre 
going to flash all of the little girls 
that Im sure are staring wideeyed at the screen in their homes.
I have a number of problems 
with the Barbie Fashionista mu
sic video. The first is, of course, 
the message that the dancing and 
singing of the video is sending to 
the little girls who are assuredly 
watching and memorizing so that 
they, too, can do the Barbie next 
time the video comes on. When I 
played with Barbies  which I did 
quite often  I played with Vet
erinarian Barbie, Doctor Barbie, 
even Wheelchair Barbie. Barbies 
were created to show that girls 
could do whatever they wanted, 
that girls didnt have to be home
makers or secretaries, that they 
could do more (though, as evi
denced by the elaborate Barbie 
houses that you can buy, theres 
absolutely nothing wrong with 
being a stay-at-home mom). The 
only message I can see in the new 
Barbie line is one that tells girls 
they can wear cute, slightly slutty 
clothes and dance with boys.
Fashion is a perfectly respect
able profession, but the Barbie 
Fashionista line isnt about work
ing in fashion, whether as a de
signer, stylist, or fashion journal
ist. The line seems rather to be 
about being a socialite  wearing cute clothes, showing off, and 
being famous. I dont really think 
this is something that little girls 
should aspire to be. Theres noth. ing wrong with being famous in 
fashion, if you work for it, but the 
line seems to be more about being 
famous and wearing the clothes 
rather than the hard work that 
goes into their creation, giving a 
bad name to real fashionistas ev
erywhere, who do actually put ef
fort into their work.
With Barbies new line coming 
out right after the doll had her 
own show at Fashion Week, Mat
tel should have focused more on 
the actual fashion aspect of the 
doll and her accessories rather 
than merely the looking good 
part. I think it wouldve been re
ally interesting to see a Barbie 
whose accessories were fashion 
sketches, or a mannequin with 
different swatches of clothing 
that could be put on it. But by 
saying that a fashionista is noth
ing more than a girl who looks 
good in pretty clothes, Mattel is 
not only minimizing the actual 
amount of work that goes into 
the fashion industry, theyre also 
going against Barbies core value: 
the belief that girls can do anything. Instead of giving the Barbie 
Fashionista line some type of re
ality, they are instead saying that 
girls should strive to look pretty, 
dance provocatively, and go after 
the guy. This just seems to be re
inforcing all the things that the 
original Barbie Girl song was 
mocking, and the things that 
Mattel sued Aqua over.
Mattel needs to reconsider what 
they are promoting when they 
decide to use a song like Barbie 
Girl to advertise their new prod
uct line. They may have changed 
the lyrics (though I dont believe 
the new ones are much better), 
but that doesnt mean that girls 
wont wonder what the song is 
from and find it within seconds 
on YouTube. And even in the new 
version of the song, the real-life 
Barbies re not any more ideal 
role models for young girls than 
the plastic dolls described in 
Aquas version of the song. They 
should reconsider a shift back to 
the old Barbies  the ones that 
encouraged girls to be whatever 
they wanted to be.

doing the Barbie anytime soon.

Leadership
Perspectives
Graduates and 
undergraduates 
work on Tartan

Douglas McIntyre_____
Ive done it again. I have gone 
and volunteered myself for a posi
tion that will subtract time from 
and add stress to my life. I have 
already been inundated with im
portant problems I must make de
cisions about. I am in heaven.
Like many of my fellow stu
dents on campus, I am caught up 
in the throes of a leadership role 
in one of Carnegie Mellons stu
dent organizations. Unlike a great 
deal of these leaders, however, I 
am a graduate student.
The school I attended for un
dergraduate study did not even 
allow graduate students to vote in 
campus organizations, let alone 
serve in the capacity I have just 
taken on as editor-in-chief of The 
Tartan. But Carnegie Mellon not 
only encourages students to cross 
disciplinary and ethnic borders, 
it also allows them to cross the 
great divide: Undergraduate ver
sus graduate study.
Consider the wonderful oppor
tunities for independent research 
offered to undergraduate students 
through programs like SURG or 
the chance to publish significant 
studies in campus journals, such 
as Thought. These kinds of chanc
es are afforded only to graduate 
students at many universities.
The most fulfilling chasm cross
ing I have been able to do has been 
the chance to get my hands dirty 
serving in student organizations.
At my undergraduate school, I 
served as the head of the copy ed
iting department for two years for 
our campus newspaper. I thought 
that when I graduated, my ca
reer at campus papers was over, 
but I was proven wrong the day 
I walked through the door of The 
Tartans office on the third floor 
of the University Center  yes, 
fellow graduate students, there is 
a third floor to that building.
The then editor-in-chief, Matt 
Campbell, encouraged me to 
come on as a member of the copy 
staff, not an unusual pursuit of 
students in the master of arts in 
professional writing program 
that is my home here at Carnegie 
Mellon. From there, it was a small 
step up the ladder to serving as 
copy manager, a comparable role 
to the one I served in two years 
ago during my undergraduate 
years.
One of the best features of The 
Tartan is the wide range of roles 
available to students, even aside 
from working with the content
 from serving on the advertis
ing and business staff to operat
ing the website to overseeing the 
staff. If you show enough interest, 
you will very likely move into a 
leadership role that looks fantas
tic on a resume, no matter your 
interest: a leadership position 
illustrates responsibility, leader
ship, and charisma.
The time and the stress are 
nothing compared to the oppor
tunities that being editor-in-chief 
of The Tartan will provide me.

COMMENTARY
Tennis finally gets attention
ASHLEY HERRICK
The U.S. Open, the biggest tennis event in the 
United States, just finished this last week, but not 
without exciting drama. While tennis is usually 
not an entertaining spectator sport, this years 
tournament got fans talking. As a lifelong ten
nis player, one would expect that I would usually 
watch tournaments. To be completely honest, be
fore the U.S. Open, I hadnt watched a professional 
tennis match since the Australian Open finals. 
I, like many fans, get bored of watching Federer 
dominate the sport, and the level of womens ten
nis is completely declining. Serena and Venus 
display some talent from time to time but never 
shot\Tconsistent effort. However, the U.S. Open 
rekindled my interest in watching professional 
tennis by throwing in a Federer defeat, a Serena 
outburst, and a plethora of talented youngsters.
Throughout the two weeks of the Open, it ap
peared as though it was going to be an average 
tournament on the mens side. After Nadal lost in 
the quarterfinals, I wasnt even going to watch the 
semifinals or the finals. Federer only lost two sets 
on the way to the finals, and he was on the path
to win, which I have seen enough times. I hap
pened to be flipping through the channels when I 
caught the battle of Federer and Juan Martin Del 
Potro in the championship match. It was the end 
of the second set, a tiebreaker, so I kept watching. 
Though Im normally a huge Federer fan, I must 
admit I was excited he was finally defeated in a 
grand slam. I think others felt that way as well.
Tennis player Jeremy King said he was thrilled 
about the Del Potro victory and stated, The FedDP match was an instant classic. It was a combina
tion of one of the greatest matches of all time and 
a huge upset.
When someone dominates the competition for 
so long, it makes the sport stagnant and people 
lose interest. It is great publicity for tennis that 
someone besides Federer finally won a major. Way 
to rekindle some interest in tennis, Del Potro.
On the womens side, theres no doubt that ten
nis got more publicity than ever. American Mela
nie Oudin, only 17, captured the heart of fans ev
erywhere. While the only hope for an American 
victory has been in the hands of Venus and Serena 
for the past several years, Oudin gave American 
tennis buffs everywhere a big shock. Before the 
Open, I had never heard of Oudin or her teenage 
media counterpart Caroline Wozniacki, currently
19. The two teenage girls had laid low in the pub
licity scene but were working on their huge tennis 
games. Oudin, who had only made it past the first 
round in one prior major, made it to the semifi
nals before losing to Wozniacki. The two could 
no longer lie low in the publicity scene, as Oudin 
was being praised for her young age and shocking 
performance while Wozniacki was commended 
for her incredible talent and charming smile. I 
was completely shocked to imagine myself at 17 
standing in front of that crowd in New York. I 
asked myself, what is it about tennis that lets such 
young women dominate the field? I came to the 
conclusion that two things make women better 
fit for professional tennis. One is the starting age. 
Tennis players often start playing tennis before 
the age of 10, making their chance for burnout 
extremely high. Most women are also in the best 
physical shape of their life in their teenage years 
to their 20s. The rigorous demand of singles wears 
greatly on bodies, especially women. So while it 
is relatively shocking to see teenagers compete in 
such high-profile events, tennis players will keep 
turning professional about this age in order to 
keep the level of the game at its peak.
The teenage attention wont be what is remem
bered about the womens U.S. Open in 2009,
though. Serena was lacking attention throughr 
out the Open. Since she wasnt going to eliminate 
the teenage phenoms, she caught her publicity by 
throwing a temper tantrum. She also caught a 
$10,000 fine. In case you missed it, Serena swore 
violently at a lineswoman the point before match 
point after she was called for a foot fault. After 
scurrying nervously to the head line-judge chair, 
the lineswoman reported Serenas outburst, get
ting Serena a point penalty on match point. Ser
ena lost the match and was furious. YouTube vid
eos surfaced of her using the f-word and talking 
about what she would do to the lineswoman with 
the little fuzzy tennis ball. As a tennis player, I 
can imagine the frustration Serena had at this 
point, but honestly, theres no excuse for acting 
that way on the court. Tennis in particular is sup
posed to be a competition of sportsmanship and 
class. Her outbursts are not uncommon, but this 
one showed Serena at a record low. She should 
have been suspended for some time. If we want to 
keep the sport of tennis honorable, there need to 
be harsher punishments for outbursts like this.
Overall, the excitement of tennis was at a record 
high. The athletes needed to supply some intrigu
ing reasons to keep watching, and they sure did 
what they needed to do to catch my attention.
Mens soccer records fifth straight win
VLAD BOUCHOUEV

In the mens soccer teams 
only game of the week, the 
Tartans downed Allegheny 
College 4-1 this past Satur
day. The team had some added 
confidence going into the game 
thanks to last weeks NSCAA/ 
Adidas Division III Rankings, 
which put the Tartans back in 
the top 25 at number 13.
The Carnegie Mellon seniorscarried the team to its vic
tory oyer the Gators, as Ryan 
Browne, Ricky Griffin, and 
Pat Lutz  who made two  
scored all of the goals, while se
nior goalie Maks Khurgin con
tributed three saves. Browne 
made sure to set the tone of the 
match in the third minute as he 
fired past Allegheny keeper An
drew Skirley from 10 yards out. 
Twenty^our minutes later, the 
Tartans got their second goal of 
the day as Griffin took advan
tage of a breakaway past the 
last defender.
Allegheny College did not 
post much of a challenge 
throughout the first half and 
the Tartans comfortably main
tained their two goal margin 
until t\alf time.
In the second half, Lutz gave 
the Tartans some insurance 
by scoring his first goal of the 
game off a pass from Browne. 
The goal, Lutzs third of the
season, gave the Tartans a 3-0 
lead. At that point, head coach  
Arron Lujan looked to put in the 
Carnegie Mellon reserves, but 
Allegheny forward Pete Subasic 
spoiled Lujans plans by scoring 
off an initial save by Khurgin. 
The Tartans controlled the game 
for the rest of regulation and 
Lutz slotted his second goal of 
the game, ending a great week 
in which he tallied two goals 
and was named University Ath
letic Association (UAA) Mens 
Soccer Athlete of the Week, as 
well as Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) Co-Player 
of the Week.
Saturdays game at Allegh
eny was a good test for our 
team. We started strong and 
were able to take an early lead,
 which was important*, ob
served senior defensive player 
John Hall. We are still looking 
to improve and shore things up 
defensively. This year we are 
hoping to compete for the UAA 
title and advance in the NCAA 
tournament.
The Tartans will take on St. 
Vincent College in an away af
ternoon fixture on Wednesday, 
Sept. 23. They will then return 
home this Saturday, Sept. 26 
at noon as they take on Grove 
City College. Come out and join 
the rest of the Tartan Army in 
support of the team, as they are 
now playing their best soccer of 
the season.

CASEY GARTH
Staffwriter
On Tuesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens golf team trav
eled to Delaware, Ohio, where 
they finished sixth overall in the 
Ohio Wesleyan University Lamkin Fall Intercollegiate.
The Tartans ended the 36-hole 
event just 29 strokes behind the 
tournament host and champion 
team with a total score of 624
(308-316).
Ohio Wesleyan, ranked num
ber 11 nationally, finished the 
event with a team score of 595. 
Taking second place with 599 on 
their team scorecard was num
ber 19 Transylvania University, 
followed by John Carroll with 
a 608, Baldwin-Wallace (614), 
and Heidelberg (619). Musk
ingum finished just behind the 
Tartans with a 632, and Deni
son (655), Ohio Northern (657),
Capital (666), and Wilmington 
(676) rounded out the field.
Blake Furgerson of John Car
roll placed first individually, 
shooting a 137 overall (72-65) 
and beating out Transylvanias 
Justin Tereshko (76-70). Tar
tans sophomore Michael Cheng 
tied for 10th individually, the 
highest a Carnegie Mellon in
dividual placed, scoring a 152 
(75-77). Right on his tail was 
his sophomore teammate Ter
ence Einhorn, whose rounds of 
76 and 77 allowed him to tie for 
12th.
Also competing for the Tar
tans were seniors Brett Cannaday and Christopher Lee and 
junior Brent Driscoll. Cannaday 
tied for 26th with a 157 (77- 
80), while Lee tied for 38th with 
a 162 (80-82), and Driscoll tied 
for 51st with a 168 (80-88).
Despite losing two key players 
to graduation, the Tartans had a
fair showing at the invitational, 
playing particularly well on the 
12th hole, the hardest of the 
course. Cheng, Cannaday, and 
Einhorn all birdied the hole, 
with Cheng and Cannaday sink
ing difficult 30-foot putts.
It is early in the season for the 
team and they are looking for
ward to improving their results 
as the season progresses. This 
tournament has allowed us to 
assess our performance and re
alize what we need to improve 
on in moving forward, Canna
day said. We are looking for
ward to the year and are hope
ful that we will continue the 
success from last year.

Womens soccer drops 4-1 decision to Otterbein College
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Sports Co-editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens soccer team continued 
their rocky start to the season 
with a 1-4 defeat at the hands 
of Otterbein College on Satur
day afternoon.
The loss put the Tartans re
cord for this seasons games 
played at 1-4.
Otterbein kicked off the 
scoring with a goal by Lindsey 
Rudibaugh during the eighth 
minute of regulation.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore 
Brianna Magill tied the score 
at 1 for the Tartans seven min
utes later with the first goal she 
has made as a Carnegie Mellon 
player. Magill headed the ball 
in off another header made by 
first-year Katie Davis.
The Cardinals were unre
lenting, though, as they scored 
to take a 2-1 lead in the 16th 
minute on a goal by midfielder 
Carly Dent. Cardinals mid
fielder Becky Bowser then 
scored her first goal in almost 
two years, taking a cross from
Adrienne Novak and deposit
ing it past Tartans junior goalie 
Anya Rosen for a 3-1 Otterbein 
advantage.
First-year Tartans goalie 
Becca Gold entered the game 
for the second half and played 
solidly, making saves in the 
52nd and 53rd minutes. Unfor
tunately for the Tartans, Gold 
let in a goal in the 58th minute 
on a penalty kick by the Cardi
nals Jenny Knox. The goal put 
the score at 4-1, where it stayed 
through the end of play, thanks 
in part to one more save by Gold 
in the 71st minute.
Saturday was another frus
trating loss, Tartans senior 
defensive player and midfielder 
Casey Garth said. We are in 
a real slump right now, but it 
is still early in the season. We 
have three more non-conference games coming up and we 
are going to have to sort some 
things out so we can go into 
conference play 4-4.

Fitness head Kevin Schultz presents Fiber Content: Static Stretching 101
KEVIN SCHULTZ
Special to the Tartan
Hello, Im Kevin Schultz, the 
director of strength and condi
tioning at Carnegie Mellon. This 
will be a bimonthly column that 
will feature informative and 
practical information regarding 
muscle and connective tissue fi
ber within your body. More spe
cifically, I will be writing on top* 
ics regarding stretching, strength 
training, exercise selection, exer
cise prescription and planning, 
and cardiovascular training, as 
well as more general topics re
garding nutrition as it relates to 
gains made from exercise. With
out further ado, Static Stretching 
101:
IV
Most commonly, people par
ticipating in physical activity 
know one  and only one  way 
to stretch: statically. Although a 
lot has changed over the past 50 
years regarding societal norms, 
technology, and stretching, static 
stretching still seems to be the 
choice for most physically active 
people. This is mostly true due 
to the ease of access to the equip
ment needed to perform static 
stretching: you.
To stretch before, during, or 
after exercise  that is the ques
tion. Actually, static stretching 
can be used at all three periods 
to improve flexibility, training 
adaptations, recovery time, and 
even injury prevention.
Pre-workout static stretch
ing is typically performed on 
various muscle groups in order
\
to warm up and prevent injury 
during a training session. Train
ers recommend stretching large 
multi-joint muscle groups (e.g. 
quadriceps, hamstrings, chest, 
and back). Muscles should be 
placed under a constant, mildly 
discomforting stretch for 15-60 
seconds depending on the num
ber of times you will stretch each 
muscle. The magic number with 
all static stretching seems to be 60 
seconds, during which you have 
the option of holding a stretch for 
one 60-second interval or up to 
four 15-second intervals.
During workout static 
stretching of the antagonist 
muscle  the muscle opposite the 
one being trained in the workout 
has been shown to improve the 
strength of the agonist muscle  
the one being trained  during
A
a lifting session. For example, 
stretching out the quadriceps  
the muscles on the front of the 
thighs  between sets of a ham
string  the back of the thigh  
exercise increases the strength 
of the hamstrings. During an 
exercise set, two muscle groups 
are always working together to 
produce movement. The agonist 
muscle contracts to produce the 
movement while the opposing 
antagonist muscle relaxes to al
low movement to happen. At 
times during movement, both 
muscles may contract at the same 
time, which can inhibit fluid mo
tions.
Stretching the antagonist 
between sets decreases co-con
traction to allow the agonist to 
produce slightly more force. Be
tween each set, a muscle can be
v
placed under stretch for 15-60 
seconds depending on your goals 
and your programmed rest inter
vals.
Post-workout static stretch
ing is probably the most widely 
known and performed type 
of stretching. Most people are 
aware of benefits that are attrib
uted to static stretching, such 
as increased flexibility and in
creased range of motion (ROM), 
but there is one large benefit 
many people miss out on. During 
a normal training session, either 
strength or cardiovascular in na
ture, muscle fibers have a habit 
of shortening in length because 
they tend to be inflexible, and 
will wear down if not exercised
 that is, if you dont use it, youll 
lose it.
During a typical training ses
sion, only a very small ROM is 
used, causing the muscle fiber to 
shorten. If the natural length of 
the fibers is not properly restored, 
this shortening can lead to mus
cular dysfunction or injury.
! Post-workout stretching is one 
way to decrease the chances of 
this happening. A short muscle 
cannot start to recover or rebuild 
until it reaches its natural resting 
muscle length. As with all static 
stretching, the goal is to stretch 
each trained or exercised muscle 
group for at least 60 seconds.
With all exercises, before you 
start, you should always consult 
your physician to gain medical 
clearance. If you have any spe
cific questions, please feel free to 
e-mail me (schultzk@) and I will 
be more than happy to help you

Womens cross 
country wins, 
men take second
ALLYSON KOYEN
Junior Staffwriter
The cross country team trav
eled to Carlisle, Pa. on Saturday 
to compete in the Dickinson Col
lege Invitational. The women 
ran a 4K race and placed first 
overall. The men ran both a 4K 
and an 8K, placing second over
all in both events.
The Tartan women finished 
strong with their top three 
runners finishing first, sev
enth, and 20th, respectively. 
First-year Emily Wobb earned 
her second first-place finish of 
the year, winning the 4K with 
a time of 14:38.7. Finishing 
next for the Tartans was junior 
Courtney Baker, who placed 
seventh with a time of 15:14.6, 
followed by sophomore Cassie 
Wallace, finishing 20th with a 
time of 15:58.7. Junior Laura 
McKee (16:07.7), first-year 
Eva Humphrey (16:35.2), and 
sophomore Alyssa Montanaro 
(16:36.6) finished in 24th, 37th, 
and 38th, respectively. The Tar
tans women won the meet with 
a score of 28.
The Dickinson Invitational 
was a great race for the wom
ens-teams, said Baker, one of 
the teams captains. Not only 
did we make a huge improve
ment as a team by winning the
4K short race, the majority of 
our individual times were per
sonal records. This race is a 
great indication of what is go
ing to come further down in the 
season.
The men also ran well for 
Carnegie Mellon. In the 8K, 
junior Dan Addis led the way, 
finishing second ' overall with 
a time of 26:06.7, followed by 
junior J.P. Allera in sixth with a 
time of 26:39.7 and senior Dario 
Donatelli (26:47.5) in seventh. 
Junior Justin Kurp crossed the 
line in 27:21.4, good enough 
for 15th, and senior Chris Rizzo 
(27:22.5) was close behind in 
16th to help seal second in the 
event with a score of 15.
In the 4K, sophomore Matt 
Jacob finished first out of the 
Tartans in 12:20.1, earning 
second place overall. Follow
ing Jacob, junior Nate Bussiere 
(12th) finished in 12:36.9 and 
sophomore Rob Morhard (21st) 
ran in a time of 12:54.9. In to
tal, the men finished second in 
the event with a score of 35. 
Overall, they finished second in 
the Dickinson Invitational with 
44 points total.
Both teams will compete on 
Oct. 10 at 11:30 a.m. in their 
only home meet of the year, the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational, 
hosted in Schenley Park.
Football suffers seasons first blemish with 24-16 defeat
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Sports Co-editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
football team, armed with a 
perfect record for the season, 
traveled to Geneva, N.Y. on Sat
urday to take on Hobart College. 
The trip turned out sour for the 
Tartans as they were never able 
to take a lead en route to a 24-16 
defeat. The loss put the Tartans 
record at 2-1.
Hobart started off the scoring 
with 8:14 to go in the first quar
ter. A 55-yard drive culminated 
with a 51-yard flea-flicker from 
Statesmen quarterback Doug 
Vella to wide out Tyler Vincent. 
The play gave the Statesmen a 
7-0 lead. The Tartans answered 
back with a 13-play, 63-yard 
drive that ended with a 1-yard 
touchdown by junior running 
back Jason Pratt. Senior Phil 
Pantalone was a main compo
nent of the driving, registering 
44 passing yards.
The tie was short-lived 
though, as on the next play, 
Statesmen kick returner An
drew Marlier ran an 85-yard 
return for a touchdown. With 
1:39 left in the first, Hobart led 
14-7. Junior place kicker Elliot 
Carnevale helped the Tartans 
cut the lead to four before the 
Statesmen took back the points 
as the two teams exchanged 
field goals, the latter coming 
on the first possession of the 
second half. The Tartans then 
gained another touchdown 
when Pratt scored on a 4-yard 
run with 11:21 to play, bringing
the Tartans within one. Carnev
ale missed the extra point, how
ever, allowing Hobart to retain 
their 17-16 edge.
The Statesmen followed the 
Tartans three-play scoring 
drive with their own sevenplay, 54-yarder that ended 
when Vella hit Hobart senior 
Paul Overdorf for a successful
4-yard touchdown pass. An ex
tra point made it 24-16, and the 
score would stay that way for 
the remaining seven and a half 
minutes of play.
It was a disappointing loss 
because we put forth a great ef
fort but werent playing smart 
football, said senior captain 
Socrates Zacharias. Our game
plan is always to rely on our as
signments and keys; failing to 
do so is costly. Our goal is just 
to learn from our mistakes and 
come out next week more pre
pared.
The Tartans will next travel to 
Ohio to take on Hiram College 
for a Saturday, Sept, 26 match. 
Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

upholds that her favorite part 
about being in school at Car
negie Mellon are the people 
surrounding her school and 
sports lives, as she has fos
tered strong friendships with 
her peers on the volleyball 
court and in the classroom.
Although she may miss her 
family while they are back in 
Lewes, Del., Size profits from 
their willingness to travel 
to matches to support her 
and her teammates. While 
her father advocated trying 
volleyball while she was in 
middle school, Size was also 
involved in basketball and 
softball growing up.
Her experience with these 
sports holds true as she par
ticipates in both, as well as in 
soccer, hockey, and kickball 
throughout the intramural 
seasons here. Having an in

IP free time, Size has proven 
that her talents are not lim

her success with sports is eas

The Carnegie Mellon volleyball team started 
their busy week by overcoming St. Vincent Col

Crossover this past weekend, beating Westmin
ster College 3-0 and Muskingum University 3-1 
Friday night, but the next day dropping a match 
to Frostburg State University 0-3 before rebound
ing to defeat John Carroll University 3-2. This 
tournament puts the Tartans at 9-4 overall.
The Tartans kicked off their week by beating 
St. Vincents 7-25, 25-18,17-25, 27-25, 15-11 to 
improve their record to 6-3. Senior outside hitter 
Megan Killeen led the way with 15 kills, and se
nior setter Sam Carter had 48 assists and 14 digs.
A few days later, the Tartans started out strong 
by outhitting Westminister to win in straight 
games, 25-17, 25-16, and 25-11. During the sec
ond game the Tartans found themselves behind 
2-4, and after six more points still trailed 5-7. Mo
mentum shifted in their favor when senior middle 
hitter Jessica Brackin and Killeen put away two 
spikes to bring the score to a tie. Junior left side 
hitter Cameron Griffin held serve for eight points 
and hit three aces. Junior outside hitter Caroline 
Size added three block assists and, along with 
sophomore outside hitter Megan Kaplon, regis
tered several key kills. Carter gave 30 assists, 12 
digs, and three kills, and Griffin added 17 digs.
Following the sweep, the Tartans overcame 
Muskingum in a close match. Brackin, junior op
posite hitter Aislinn McCloskey, Size, and Killeen 
dominated the court with three kills apiece to 
help take the first game, 25-17. Muskingum ral
lied back and won the second game, 20-25, after 
being down 19-16. After a moment of regroup
ing, the Tartans grabbed game three 25-20 and 
closed out the match by decisively winning game 
four at 25-17. Griffin and Killeen led the team 
with 23 and 17 digs, respectively, while Carter

An artistic look at the G20Everything you need to know
Comic artists from around the world express their views About juggling relationships and dream jobs
A lot of attention has been given to the G20 occurring 
this week in Pittsburgh. Stories have been written 
about the world leaders attending, the security 
measures, the protesters, and even a little about what 
is going to be discussed during the international 
conference. What may be even more interesting, 
though, are the cartoons being sketched about the 
world event. Drawn to the Summit is an exhibition 
of political cartoons from around the world that 
opened last Friday at The Andy Warhol Museum and 
captures the global perspective of the G20.
The exhibit features cartoons from nearly all of 
the countries in the G20, including some from the 
European Union. Going around the room, one can put 
together a geopolitical picture that describes themes 
ranging from global warming to world hunger to 
economic troubles. Each country has a different style 
of drawing used in the cartoons, yet the real art is in 
the message that is being conveyed.
Some countries opt for more conservative messages 
or issues while others freely speak their mind. The 
Canadian cartoon North American Dinosaur by 
Brian Gable portrays the North American auto 
industry as dinosaur bones while a teacher credits ' 
their downfall to brains the size of peas. In contrast, 
a French cartoon, Prime Real Estate" by Jean Plantu,

"Silent Tsunami" by Argentinean artist Alberto Sabat 
shows a young boy starving in Africa, not afraid of an

is a statement about how the media ignores the fact 
that there are more people dying of hunger every 
day than did as a result of the 2004 tsunami. Another 
Argentinean, Sergio Langer, makes fun of the George

direction while shoes fly in the Other. This cartoon is 
creatively named Missiles and Shoes."
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial cartoonist Rob 
Rogers and art historian Sylvia Rhor came up with 
the idea to have this exhibit when it was announced 
that the G20 was coming to Pittsburgh. As everyone 
was trying to come up with a project for the G20, 
the two were talking with Toonseum executive 
director Joe Wos, who introduced the idea for an 
exhibit on global cartoons. Both Rogers and Rhor then 
went looking for support and were able to get The 
Pittsburgh Foundation to provide funding and The 
Warhol to provide the space.

cartoons, they tried to choose those that would give 
a complete world perspective.
What emerged is a collage of world views on 
display at The Andy Warhol Museum. There are 
strong feelings of anti-Americanism, and Wall 
Street gets its fair share of jabbing, but the most 
prevalent theme is the unjust exclusivity of the 
G20. While some mock the G20 as really being the 
G8 plus 12 guests, others comment on the lack of 
participation from the rest of the developing world. 
One surprising feature of the exhibit is that it does 
not take the side of the peasant or the corporate 
giant. It does a good job of objectively looking at 
the issues and presenting them.
The exhibit, aside from representing worldviews, 
also presents cartoons from Pittsburgh local 
newspapers. One local cartoon pokes more fun 
at yinzers, people who speak Pittsburgh English, 
than anyone else. Git Aht! by Randy Bish shows

Dear Prerna,
I have been dating my high 
school boyfriend since two 
years before college, but now 
that I am here juggling the 
relationship, meeting new 
people, and working, everything 
has gotten overwhelming. I love 
my boyfriend and dont want 
that to end, but I dont think I 
am able to do justice to all three 
simultaneously. What should I 
do?
Threes A Crowd 
Dear Crowd,
Wow. Thats a really complicated 
and exhausting situation youre in: 
You want to give your boyfriend 
time, but still make great friends and 
maintain good grades. First of all, let 
me'remind you of the most important 
thing: Youre in college! You should 
enjoy every moment of it. If I were 
you, Id make sure my grades were 
up to the mark and then Id go out 
and meet new people, join different 
clubs, socialize with the kids on my 
the works.
There are some really great people 
out there that are eager to get to 
know you. But, at the same time, I 
wouldnt neglect my boyfriend. At 
every given instance Id keep him in 
the loop, however difficult it might 
be to communicate and convey 
how I feel. Your boyfriend is probably 
in the same boat as you, so its 
important to understand each other 
and try and compromise. Youre 
still a lucky first-year and, believe 
me, this opportunity never comes 
back again. Just be respectful of 
his time, thoughts, and beliefs. Set 
ground rules and clearly lay out the 
expectations. It is much simpler with 
everything clearly laid out.
Live it; you deserve it,
Prema
Dear Prerna,
I am in my senior year and I have 
been going crazy with the BOC; 
however, I cannot find a job that 
fits my bill. Ive gotten interviews 
with some companies but I dont 
think they interest me. What 
should I do? I am graduating 
very soon and I need to decide.
Unhappy and Unemployed
Dear Unemployed,
First of all, Id like to remind you 
that you are not the only one in 
this situation. With the increasing 
number of career options in todays 
economy, people are becoming 
more choosey and cant seem to find 
anything that fits their description of 
the perfect job.
I personally recommend looking 
into other options as well. Do you 
really need a job or are you willing 
to wait it out? You can do a masters 
program or travel the world in the 
meantime; this can really help you 
figure out what you want from life. 
How Id love to take a year off from 
school and travel the world!
If you do need a job, do some more 
research and try finding what suits 
you. There are plenty of options out 
there. I would highly recommend 
you go through your interviews and, 
later, narrow down your options. 
You can pick a job and then switch 
later if you find something else that 
works better for you. Remember, it 
isnt easy to find your dream job on 
the first shot.
Rework your rsum,
Prerna

Then came a frantic blur of activity as they reached 
out across the globe for cartoons to use for the 
exhibit. Rogers wanted to show an alternative to just 
the leaders coming to Pittsburgh. Rhor, who is fluent 
in multiple languages, was able to contact many 
artists from around the world in order to bring in 
international cartoons. After they received nearly 250

Tales from abroad: Miraflor
Coffee and conversations spark a wonderful journey through Nicaragua
How many cups of coffee do you drink per semester?
Coffee is a significant part of not only our lives, but also the 
lives of Nicaraguans  in a very different way, of course.
We went on a unique study abroad experience with our 
floor-mates as a part of the Global Studies Program during 
the spring break of our first year. Instead of the coffee bean 
traveling to us, we got to travel to the coffee bean, and since 
we had the time of our lives there, we want to give you a taste 
of the flavor of Nicaragua.
Coffee is one of the prime exports of and the means of 
livelihood in Nicaragua. We not only witnessed this, but also 
immersed ourselves in the Nicaraguan way of life for a few 
days. Miraflor is a small village in the north of Nicaragua 
where we stayed with local families, learning all about their 
lives and about coffee, which is their life.
The houses in Miraflor were very humble, with a kitchen, a 
living room, and a guest room. There was no sewage system. 
To us, this meant that we had to walk for about a hundred 
meters before we could use the facilities. During the day, 
this wasnt too bad  but imagine taking the walk when 
it is pitch black outside. Yes, it was pitch black, because 
electricity isnt supplied to this community. They charged the
one light in the house using solar power during the day, and 
because our hosts were exceedingly hospitable, this light was 
mounted in the guest rooms during our stay.
That wasnt the only exception they made for us. Theres 
nothing like a good meal at the end of a hard days work, and 
our meals in Miraflor were no exception. Naturally, due to 
their limited means, their daily meals werent very elaborate. 
And although we didn't work half as hard as our host parents 
did, we did get a delicious reward for it. Our host mom 
prepared some fresh tortillas, soup, some plantains, dessert, 
and of course gallo pinto. Gallo pinto is the staple food of 
Nicaragua and is a delectable, yet simple, dish of rice and 
beans. We werent tired of it even after eating it for every meal 
for more than a week.
What touched us most were the people of Nicaragua. Their 
spirit was inspiring. They were always eager to learn about 
new things, to cooperate and help each other, and they had a 
very strong sense of community.
During one of our dinners, our host dad told us that he likes to 
attend the training sessions that the agricultural university, 
located four to five hours of travel away, organizes so that he 
can learn new practices like vermi-compost, the use of solar 
panels, etc., and does so whenever he can. He proudly gave 
us a tour of his backyard, explaining in detail how he applies 
these newly learned organic and eco-friendly practices. Also, 
even though he and his wife were illiterate and they needed 
more hands for farm work, they sent all their children to school 
and college. Now, their children not only have jobs, but also 
travel internationally. Eventually, our host parents learned to 
read and write Spanish from their own children. This attitude 
is rare to come by and impossible to forget.
Over the course of.the week, we learned about how coffee 
is grown and how it is dried, processed, and packaged.
We toured the Las Segovias Coffee Mill of PRODECOOP, a 
cooperative that helps the farmers of Miraflor sell their coffee. 
This is where we participated in a coffee-cupping session, in 
which coffee was tasted and smelled for richness, quality, and 
consistency.
Coffee-cupping is a very specific procedure in which 
there are three samples of each coffee. More than 10 such 
different coffees are graded at one time. First one smells all 
the samples, then adds some hot water to them, carefully 
sucking it to splash it at the back of the mouth for a burst 
of taste before spitting it out. What is remarkable is that the 
professionals grade about 300 different coffees per day  
and we thought we drank a lot of coffee.
Cooperatives seem to be commonplace in this country, 
which relatively recently ended a war. We observed that they 
always try to work together to help themselves, each other, 
and the community as a whole. Actually, that is how the 
coffee farmers can afford to even have their own farmland. 
Every individual farmer in a cooperative owns a small piece 
of land. However, in order to be certified as organic or fair and 
free trade zones, they need to have a minimum area of land, 
which an individual farmer cannot afford. Hence, they register 
it under one cooperative and work on each others lands to 
get maximum yield for the cooperative. In Nicaragua, we 
witnessed that unity is strength.
Our trip to Nicaragua helped us reach out to a bigger world, 
but it also brought us closer to each other. Now every cup of 
coffee reminds me of our trip to Nicaragua, about what we 
learned and experienced there.
Every coffee bean has a story to tell, if you are willing to taste it.

Bum Bum ignites the crowd
OLP entertains with new releases and old favorites
Courtesy of Jeremy Kanter
Raine Maida shows off his new style to the audience.
This past week, alternative rock band Our Lady Peace 
(OLP) performed at the Carnegie Library of Homestead 
Music Hall in Munhall, Pa. in front of a modest, yet die
hard, group of fans.
The band is one of the most popular Canadian rock 
bands of the last couple of decades, one that has sold 
over 5 million albums worldwide and retains a mediumto-large cult following wherever they travel. In addition, 
they hold the distinction of owning the most number of 
awards, a grand total of 10, given out in the history of 
the MuchMusic Video Awards (Canadas version of the 
Grammy or MTV awards).
OLP burst onto the scene in 1994 with their debut 
album Naveed. Since then, they have released six 
albums including their most recent, Burn Burn, which 
they are currently promoting on tour throughout the 
United States. Whats special about this album is that 
it is the second one that follows what has been called a 
radical departure from their distinctive sound, an overall 
new style change for the band that began in 2001 with 
their album Gravity. In particular, lead vocalist Raine 
Maida's singing during the bands early years was 
called erratic and unrivaled by various reviewers, giving 
songs an unreal and almost fantasy-esque feel to them. 
More recently, Maida has strayed from his trademark 
type of singing; some would call it more mainstream.
Opening the night were the bands Paper Tongues 
and Inward Eye, and both showed off solid sets. Eyes 
punkish rock attitude was a great warmup for OLPs 
more surreal rocking persona. Just after 9:30 p.m.,
Raine Maida, Jeremy Taggart, Duncan Coutts, and 
Steve Mazur took the stage with thunderous applause 
from the crowd and jumped right into their new songs 
from Burn Burn. But it was clear that the band had not 
forgotten what got them to where they are today; a third 
of their set had songs that were eight or more years old, 
including smash hits "Clumsy and Superman's Dead."
One notable moment involved an audience member 
being invited on stage to sing the lyrics to Starseed. 
The member had attended OLPs Cleveland, Ohio 
performance three weeks ago, had jumped on stage 
and danced there, and then proceeded to follow OLP
to Pittsburgh. Maida made light of the fact that he 
never would have guessed his first duet would be with 
another man. A laugh came when Maida dedicated a 
song to "that asshole Kanye West.
My personal favorite part of the show came when OLP 
performed Is Anybody Home? and Maida allowed the 
crowd to sing the chorus by themselves, which we did 
beautifully, according to the man himself. The sound 
itself was chilling, and just knowing that there were 
so many die-hard fans in the same place was a great 
feeling.
Over the course of the show,-OLP performed a relatively 
equal mix of material from Burn Burn and popular 
hits from older albums, a good decision considering 
OLP hasnt performed in Pittsburgh in years. It was 
a wonderful trip down memory lane, hearing some 
old favorites jumbled in with everything OLP's been 
working on for the past four years. Maidas vocal style 
is different now, but it definitely did not make for a 
boring or weak show. OLP has more than enough ability 
and talent to change for the better, and, at least in 
the eyes of the hundreds of people who sang along to 
nearly everything OLP put forth last Tuesday, they have 
already shown they can.

Paperhouse
On romancing opera
Guy meets girl. Girl loves guy. Guy is a jerk. Guy kills his best friend. 
Guy loves girl. Girls got another guy. *
In an extremely small nutshell, this is the plot of Eugene Onegin, 
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovskys most popular and enduring opera. You may 
have seen posters around campus for it, as the Pittsburgh Opera is 
performing.it at the end of the month, and Carnegie Mellon students 
can get some pretty cheap tickets. If youve never seen an opera 
before, Onegin is a great place to start.
Based on Pushkins epic poem of the same name, Eugene Onegin is 
set in Russia in the 1820s. The opera begins with the cynical Onegin 
accompanying his friend Lensky to the home of Lenskys fiancee, 
Olga. When Olgas older sister Tatyana spies Onegin, she is smitten. 
She writes him a letter, which he flatly rejects, telling her he is not 
suited or inclined to marry. Later, he is convinced by Lensky to go to a 
party for Tatyana, only to flirt with Olga instead. Lensky is furious, and, 
in a fateful duel, Onegin kills him.
The final act takes place many years later as a dejected Onegin visits 
Tatyana at the home of her husband  a prince. They confess their 
love for one another, but she has resolved to stay with her husband. At - 
the finale, she leaves him alone without friends or a lover.
Oddly enough, the story eerily parallels Tchaikovskys own life. While 
writing Onegin, he received a letter from a former student of his, 
Antonina Milyukoff, confessing that she had been madly in love with 
him since her days at school. He rejected her, but as he wrote the 
opera, he began to wonder if he, too, would end up alone. After a 
second letter, he told her that he did not love her  many think that 
he was a closeted homosexual  but he agreed to marry her. The 
marriage, unfortunately, was short-lived, and Tchaikovsky suffered a 
nervous breakdown, fleeing to Switzerland to recuperate. What may 
have transpired between Tatyana and Onegin is left to the imagination, 
but Tchaikovsky was truly not suited for marriage.
Metropolitan Opera regular Dwayne Croft sings the title role, with rising 
Russian star Anna Samuil as Tatyana. Raymond Very, husband of 
Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of voice Laura Knoop Very, sings 
the role of Lensky, Onegins ill-fated friend.
If you think that opera is outdated and only for old women with funny 
glasses, just give this one a try  you may find yourself in a love affair 
of your own.

Stomp makes garbage sound good
Musical reinvents its dance moves to enthrall audiences once again
The international hit Stomp premiered at the Benedum Center 
in downtown Pittsburgh last Tuesday. The show has just 
entered its 16th season off Broadway, making it one of the 
longest-running international productions to date.
Although the show lacked any actual dialogue, it was 
anything but silent. In an enthralling combination of dance, , 
percussion, and high energy, the performers of Stomp used 
modern day garbage as their instruments, dancing to the 
beat of trash cans and kitchen pans. Through active audience 
participation and a comical unspoken script, attendees were 
left to interpret and conclude their own plotlines.
From its humble beginnings as a street performance in the 
U.K., Stomp has seen unparalleled success. The show has 
debuted in 36 countries worldwide, selling out hundreds 
of theaters and receiving several international awards.
With shows in New Yorks Orpheum Theater and Londons 
Ambassador Theater, along with two tours actively traveling 
through both Europe and the United States, Stomp has 
become a recognizable and respected title in the performance 
world.
However, Stomp veterans shouldnt be fooled by the familiar 
name. The shows creators, Steve McNicholas and Luke 
Creswell, have reworked the choreography and composition 
of the show especially for this years U.S. tour. "The tour 
changes are great  they keep the audience guessing, said
Courtesy of Veronica Corpuz
Superb dancers and Innovative sounds come together to
form a spectacular show.
Elec Simon, one of the eight traveling troupe performers. You 
may think you know what were going to do next, but you . 
have no idea. With new full-scale routines using tractor tire 
inner tubes and recycled paint cans, audiences witness the 
greatest Stomp routine changes since the late 1990s.
Due to popular demand, some components of the show 
have remained unchanged. Brooms, bungee cords, and  
wooden poles are established signatory props in the shows 
choreography.
My favorite scene of the show is Poles,' said Simon. "We 
come out with these giant sticks and surround this imaginary 
campfire, like we're all warriors about to fight each other. Its 
our most intense piece, I think. We make this symphony of 
noise with just our poles, our hands, and our feet. Besides 
being experienced dancers, every member of the Stomp 
cast is also a well-trained musician. Their pieces involve 
complicated time signatures and unique intervals that make 
the show both intricate and exciting.
Every second of the show was entertaining, said Candace 
Spellmeyer, an undecided first-year CIT student. The 
performers are more like a drill team. The songs are so 
complicated and every player is in perfect sync.
As far as productions go, Stomp is highly recommended. The 
show is a flawlessly renewed representation of rhythm and 
energy in an unconventional presentation, and audiences 
will be consistently entertained throughout the 90-minute 
performance. This junkyard landmark has truly been recycled.

Theater in New York City. Tickets can be purchased at www.

Delectable Latin American tapas downtown
Sample some of Sevlches marinated fish and pulled chicken taquitos
For most students, grabbing a bite means heading to one 
of the relatively affordable restaurants located near campus. 
Sometimes, though, students may have a desire to break 
out and spend a night in the city. If this is the case, head 
downtown and visit Seviche, a restaurant serving a wide 
variety of Latino tapas.
Ceviche is a traditional Latin American dish that, in its purest 
form, is fish marinated in lime juice. There are many different 
varieties of this dish, but the original ceviche is speculated 
to be from Peru. In the traditional Peruvian style, ceviche 
is made of chunks of raw fish marinated in lemon and lime 
juice, chopped onions, garlic, tomatoes, and a little bit of chili 
pepper, and is usually served with tortillas or tortilla chips.
The fish is cooked by the citric acid in the marinade and is 
served at room temperature. This dish provides a quick, easyto-make summer meal.
At Seviche, customers can sample many different 
preparations of the dish, and this brings in tastes from around 
the world. The menu gives you seven styles of ceviche that 
then.can be made with 13 different types of fish. The two 
most popular styles, traditional and Asian tartare, go best 
with the ahi tuna. The traditional ceviche is a very simple 
take on the dish that is both light and substantive. The Asian 
tartare is equally delicious. Little rice squares serve as the 
base for the fish seasoned with soy sauce and accented with 
wasabi mayonnaise and white truffle oil. The Asian flair is 
well-balanced and the taste of the tuna is pleasant but not 
overbearing.
Joshua Debner | Photo Staff
Seviche offers patio seating to enjoy dinner outside.
Aside from ceviche, the restaurant also features many 
different tapas. The pulled chicken taquitos show off the 
executive chef Yves Carreaus inventive style. The pulled 
chicken is wrapped in a fluffy tortilla and then fried and 
served with a tomato-based mole. "Addicting" is the best 
word to describe them. Seviche also serves mini ahi tuna 
burgers. This Americanized version of ceviche features soft, 
yet crisp, ciabatta buns with ceviche in the middle, and is
only garnished with micro greens and wasabi mayo. Simple, 
yet full of flavor, almost everyone at the restaurant had an 
order of these on their table.
In trying to recreate the South American mood, the restaurant 
features an extensive menu of mojitos and specialty drinks. 
Caipirinha, a traditional Brazilian cocktail, is another notable 
drink at Seviche. It is made with cachaca (distilled sugar 
cane), fresh lime, and raw sugar, and the lime really comes 
through and dominates the drink.
The atmosphere of South America really shows in the decor 
as well. Customers are inclined to feel as if they have left 
Pittsburgh and traveled all the way to South Beach in Miami. 
Vibrant colors are present throughout the restaurant and 
accent the many pieces of Latin art arranged throughout.
The presentation and quality of the food would lead one to 
expect an extremely large bill at Seviche, but everything is 
actually moderately priced, which makes this restaurant a 
prime choice for a night out in the city. The casual feel of the 
place makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable. 
Being allowed to just sit back and appreciate the food and 
company is a major plus.

Julie and Julia follows recipe for success
Film explores the joys of cooking in the past and present
While it might seem that Julia Child's cookbooks are among 
the last things that anyone would expect to change lives 
or revolutionize self-perception, Julie and Julia is a movie 
based on such a premise. The movie does contain delicious 
entrees and desserts and is put together well, with scenes 
ranging from a flat above a pizza shop in New York City to the 
sprawling roads of Paris. Initially, some may write the film off 
as a chick flick, but Julie and Julia is more than a film for fans 
of the famous chef.
The plot, of course, revolves around food. The film follows the 
storylines of two different women in two different times: Julia 
Child (Meryl Streep), when she first arrives in Paris with her 
husband in the early 1950s, and Julie Powell (Amy Adams), 
when she moves into a flat just over a pizza parlor in the 
Big Apple in 2003. Both women, old and young, struggle to 
find their places in their new worlds: Julia tries her hand at 
making hats and fails, and Julie watches as all her friends 
prosper while she is featured in one of their articles as one 
of those thirty-somethings that never made it. Still, both 
women persevere and eventually find their niche: Julia with 
her cooking and Julie with her writing. However, its hardly 
easy from there. Julia must contend against male chefs at the 
Cordon Bleu in her efforts to prove herself worthy of taking the 
class, and Julie has to split her time between cooking every 
recipe in Julias cookbook to record on her blog and spending 
time with her husband.
The scene changes between France and America arent 
jarring, though during some down times of the film, the 
viewer might wish that the transitions happened sooner. The 
film is canied more by its characters than its effects, but these 
characters relationships and the strains on them are what 
make watching Julie and Julia so entertaining. The stress on 
Julies husband as her Internet fame grows slowly escalates 
through the film, to the point where he gets so tired of being 
edged out of his marriage that he leaves. Likewise, Julia has 
difficulty coping both with the fact that she and her husband, 
Paul, must leave Paris and that they will never be able to have 
a child of their own.
Though the primary focus is on the food and relationships, 
the movie does lead the viewer to wonder about how todays 
world is different from that of the past. Relations between 
Julie and her husband suffer when Julie starts to put her 
project before her marriage, a set of priorities alien to Julias 
world. At the same time, when Paul is interrogated about his 
connections to communism without being allowed to sleep, 
the audience gets a sense of just how different the world has 
. become.
That is not to stay that Julie and Julia doesnt have its comical 
moments. When Julie realizes what exactly goes into the 
preparation of a lobster, she can hardly believe the task that 
is set before her. Still, she keeps going. Sometimes the results
arent always for the best, and wished-for events fail to come 
to fruition more than once.
Perhaps most intriguing about the film is that, though the 
expectation viewers have is for everything to work out and 
end happily, it rarely does. Cooking, like life, has its high 
points and its failures, ranging from missed opportunities 
to burnt stews. Even at the films conclusion, though the 
audience is sure that a certain event must happen and that a 
certain someone must approve, it never does.
What makes Julie and Julia remarkable is that life goes on for 
the characters. Julie is heartbroken, but she gets over it. Julia 
accepts that she will remain childless and that nothing can 
change that. The film, unlike other "based on a true story 
adaptations, doesnt sugarcoat its rough edges; rather, it 
presents them as unabashedly as the joyful moments, like a 
medley of different ingredients, and this is what makes it a joy 
to watch.

With a tagline like Youll never look 
at dinner the same way again, how 
could anyone not be psyched about 
this award-winning documentary? 
Food, Inc. takes a hard look at 
the way food Is produced here 
in America  which often leads 
to a very unhealthy, unclean, and 
economically unstable conclusion 
along with an unflattering look at 
Industrial food production. A mustsee for anyone who eats. Fun 
fact: Director Robert Kenner spent 
much of his budget on legal fees to 
avoid lawsuits from the companies 
criticized in the film.

It has been seven years since the last 
Star Trek film  the longest stretch 
for the series yet  but J.J. Abrams 
reboot of the franchise makes the wait 
worth it. With almost $400 million in 
the bank and near-universal praise for 
the flick, Star Trek was a full-fledged 
blockbuster when released over the 
summer. The film has a slick intro that 
brushes off the old films while still 
respecting them and begins anew with 
fresh faces who are more than capable 
of taking Star Trek  to borrow a 
phrase  where no movie franchise 
has gone before.

Okay, it does, but Ive got to drum

seven years prior. Things go awry 
and we soon see why Event Horizon 
received an R rating  violent gore

film developed a strong cult following 
after failing to make back its budget

Starbucks, GWAP, and Juicy Couture
Tartans triumph in every field
[ by Laura Thoren { Staffwiiter J
Not everyone is aware that a little piece of Carnegie Mellon 
is'sitting on most of the working world's desk at this very 
moment, and it comes in the form of a coffee cup. The logo 
of Starbucks is designed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Terry 
Heckler, who graduated in the class of 1964 with a major in 
art. He is also the creator of the brand logos for JanSport, New 
Balance, and the Qdoba restaurant chain.
Carnegie Mellon alumni have made numerous contributions 
in the realms of design, computers, film, and beyond  and 
continue to make an impact as we speak  we just dont 
always hear about it. The new virtual "Brag Book cmu.edu/ 
brag compiles accomplishments of everything Carnegie 
Mellon, all in one place, and makes bragging about the 
university as easy as the click of a mouse. Although most of 
the alumni featured on the page have relocated elsewhere 
in the world, I caught up with Luis von Ahn and Kenneth 
Koedinger, both of whom hold doctorates from Carnegie 
Mellon and teach on campus.
Von Ahn completed his dissertation at Carnegie Mellon 
in 2005 and has been named one of the 50 Best Brains in 
Science by Discover Magazine and one of Popular Science 
magazines "Brilliant 10. He is credited for developing 
CAPTCHAs (Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell 
Computers and Humans Apart), as well as GWAPs (Games 
With A Purpose). CAPTCHAs are the squiggly letters one 
must decipher in order to access a website so that the 
webpage is able to distinguish a human from a computer, 
a test that has helped sites like Ticketmaster. corp prevent 
scalpers from purchasing tickets in bulk and reselling them at 
a higher price.
It was on a flight that von Ahn first came up with the idea of 
a GWAP. As everyone in his row sat idly solving a crossword 
puzzle, von Ahn remembers thinking, Wouldnt it be more 
useful to use this time for something else? The notion of 
playing a game that was purposeful .such as one that 
would, like Google Image Labeler, help search engines
better identify images  was born. Two pic 
communicate, must choose a word to desci 
continue playing until both agree upon a si 
noun in order to win points. The game can

Juicy Couture sweat suit is also the only contemporary 
outfit featured within the permanent fashion exhibit at the 
Victoria and Albert Museum in London, making the talent of 
a Carnegie Mellon graduate the representation for an entire 
generation of clothing.
The brag book is not limited to alumni but also includes 
achievements on campus, such as the fact that Carnegie 
Mellon was the first university to be trifly connected, or 
wireless. Stever House, built in 2003, is the first all-green 
dormitory to be included on a United States college campus. 
Carnegie Mellon is the only university to house Apple, 
Microsoft, Google, and Intel under one roof within the 
Collaborative Innovation Center. Four years pass quickly, 
but a connection to Carnegie Mellon lasts a lifetime.

Hail to the new Margaret Morrison class! 
A news brief from the beginning of the 
year indicates that due to the scarcity 
of out-of-town girls, there wont be a 
Sept 22 1909 dormitory fr Margaret Morrison this 
year: Those from distant cities are told 
to find their own homes. Its somewhat 
depressing to know that Carnegie 
Mellon has always been lacking on the 
female side of the gender ratio.

An editorial board cartoon shows things 
that students should stock up for 
Homecoming. Among these items are 
a buggy, cherry pop, and beverages

they couldnt print the words $%# and

Everyone witnessed the events that occurred at the MTV 
Video Music Awards. We saw Beyonces one-in-a million 
performance, Pink swinging in midair, and the talk of the 
town: Kanye West taking the microphone from Taylor Swift. 
But in all of this madness, did anyone notice that the VMAs 
are hardly even about music anymore?
Last year, Britney Spears won just about a thousand awards 
for her recently released song "Piece of Me, but some have 
said that she may have received those awards because MTV 
felt bad for her and wanted to encourage her re-entry into 
the music world. It seems like just about all of the female 
nominees won an award in each category, just to be fair. 
People seem to corrre to the VMAs not to perform, but for a 
performance. What I mean is that the VMAs are the perfect 
opportunity for people like Kanye West and Lil Mama to come 
out and do something outrageous that will be talked about in 
the media and remembered for the next year.
Senior economics major Brianna Agyemang agrees and 
discusses how MTV plays fewer videos now than they used 
to. I thought MTV stood for Music Television. Maybe I 
misinterpreted the meaning," she said. Awards arent given 
for how good the music is, but I feel like they give awards to 
people so the fans dont get upset, regardless of what the best 
video may have been. Im talking about the categories that 
fans dont vote for. Lady Gaga and Beyonce both had videps 
that were never done before and Taylor Swift had ... a video 
that we have seen before. High school girl chases high school 
boy. Really? Are you serious right now?
CD releases are coming out every week, and many of these 
are artists we havent heard from in a long time, like Whitney 
Houston, and some are artists we hear from every day. But no 
matter the case1, the spotlight always seems to be taken by 
someone who does something, either planned or spontaneous, 
that is aimed at gaining attention. Lady Gaga had a very 
interesting performance of her hit Paparazzi, where she bled 
and then was hoisted above her backup dancers. Then, later 
in the show, she appeared in a red outfit that covered her face 
and raised above her head something that resembled a crown. 
Now really, for what other reason would anyone wear an outfit 
like that if not to gain the paparazzis attention?
Music has changed in so many ways. It is hardly about 
the content of your song or the creativity of your video. 
Nowadays, it seems that music is all about popularity and
music

how many fans have been generated over the year, allowing 
just a few artists to take over the industry. Maybe we can 
look forward to more next year as each generation brings 
something new along with it.
Music is heard everywhere in the world today, and so many 
people can make music. Music is in the footsteps we make, 
the sound of the car engine revving, and even the shower 
turning on. Even though music is everywhere, it is still 
difficult to get quality sounds and honest music from those 
who claim to be artists. Maybe the term entertainer" has 
taken on a more literal meaning as artists now are all about 
entertaining by any means necessary. They keep their fans 
encompassed in their daily lives by performing the most 
ridiculous stunts. So, lets wait until next year to see what 
happens.

Toss on some skates and put Olivia Newton-John on the 8-track player, 
because youre facing some pretty intense roller derby competitors this 
week. Keep an eye out for Buster Blonde; all that peroxide on her head 
finally damaged her brain. 
Your visit to that mountain resort will heat up when you meet the sexy 
dance instructor. Too bad your family will forbid you from dating such 
a bad influence. Just remember one thing: Nobody puts Baby in a 
corner.
Once upon a time, you were falling in love. Now youre only falling apart. 
Theres nothing you can do.
Better answer your phone when you get a call from Los Angeles; the 
Phoenix Foundation needs your help. Remember to pack a can of bug 
spray, a chocolate bar, and a roll of duct tape in case you need to break 
into a high-security building.
Its time to put on your best outfit  Members Only jacket, acid-washed 
jeans, and those neon hi-tops. After all, how else are you going to 
impress that hottie you saw at L.A. Gear last weekend?
Try not to get too attached to ail those slap bracelets youve been 
collecting. The school is about to ban them. Something about reports 
of injuries.
You have died of dysentery.

Your smurfing ColecoVision is going to get all smurfed up this week. 
Fortunately, that will give you more time to smurf your, sweetie or 
whoever else is hanging around the video arcade.
After getting chased by ghosts and bouncing a ball off a rectangle at 
other rectangles, you should probably rest up. You'll have to dig through 
two-dimensional tunnels to get away from some weird lizard things.
Your best friend will make you a super-special awesome friendship 
bracelet, but only if you promise to stop saying like before like every 
like word like you like say.
Its always such a hard decision: teased-up giant curls  complete 
with a whole can of hair spray  or a side ponytail. Just remember 
that as long as you tie your shirt off at the side, you'll look totally rad 
either way.
If youve been having a bad month, its because Mercury has been in 
retrograde. If you havent, it will all end next week, when the retrograde 
period ends. Sorry, Pisces. Better put on your tinfoil helmet and stay 
underground. SIKE!
