BASKET BALL
ALLEGHENY GAIET
On last Saturday night Tech met Allegheny Col
lege on their Meadville floor, and try as they would 
they were unable to defeat the home team. It is 
worthy of mention at this place that the Allegheny 
College teams have not lost a game on their own 
floor during the past seven years. This is a record 
which has seldom if ever been equaled. The Alle
gheny five is undoubtedly the fastest college team 
in Western Pennsylvania and can rightly claim the 
championship of the Intercollegiate League.
Tech entered the game with a new line-up. Dolan 
was unable to play and his place was filled by Casey. 
It was a good game that Casey put up in this new 
position and showed up favorably with the work of 
his opposing center. Agnew was on the bench for 
the first entire game of the season. He entered the 
Grove City game after having been sick the entire 
week and the fast play was his undoing. His place 
was filled by Williams, who was moved from for
ward to guard. Williams clearly demonstrated that 
he is one of the most versatile players on the team. 
Whichever position he fills, and he has filled all with 
the exception of that of center, is handled most cred
itably and his work during the past two games was 
brilliant throughout.
Notwithstanding the changes in the line-up, the 
team worked well and gave the best exhibition of 
ball which has been seen on the Meadville floor dur
ing the past year. Fast play and spirit characterized 
their game throughout, but they met a better team 
and suffered defeat. The game was a decided im
provement over the previous game.
During the coming week the final standing of the 
teams in the league will be settled. Although it is 
now an impossibility for Tech to win the champion
ship, it will be a credit for our team to win second 
place when it is understood that this is practically 
the first year in which they have figured in the col
legiate basket-ball world. Score:
Allegheny39. Tech21.
GROVE YI$Y GAIET
As a result of the games of last week the basket
ball team relinquished its hold on first place in the 
Intercollegiate League, where it was tried with Alle
gheny College and moved to second place. The 
team which left Pittsburg to fight for the honor of 
Tech was a badly crippled one. This, coupled with 
the lack of practice, which was the result of our 
being unable to procure the Duquesne Garden, tells 
the story of our defeat in the two games.
The Grove City College five which Tech defeated 
so decisively earlier in the year showed a decided 
reversal of form and took the Tech team into camp 
by a whirlwind finish. During the first half Tech 
held her own and played on even terms with the

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
Grove City quintet. This half ended with Grove City 
leading by four points.
The second half opened with both teams playing 
an extremely fast game. The exhibition given by 
the Tech team did not, however, compare with the 
rapid work of Grove City, and they were slowly but 
surely mown down. Our men seemed unable to find 
each other or the basket and the' result was soon 
apparent. Score:

WHI$E FRIARS BUSYT
The dancing chorus of the White Friars have been 
at work for the last three weeks with the dances for 
the play to be produced this year, His Highness the 
Chief. The singing chorus, most of whom have 
been chosen from the Glee Club, will be working to
gether by the time this account reaches the hands 
of the readers. The first cast trial was held in the 
Assembly Hall on Saturday afternoon. The new 
men were given copies of last years play, and read 
through parts of it to give the coach some idea of 
their ability. Copies of the new play were not ready 
in time to be used at the trials, being still in the 
hands of the stenographer.
YOBP $i%Ol $SLiBHOyT
Another call for the cast has been made for Thurs
day night. Any man who is a bona-fide undergradu
ate of the Carnegie Technical Schools in good stand
ing, is eligible to take part in either the cast or the 
chorus. Except for the members of the White 
Friars Club, elected from the men taking part in last 
years production, there are no dues or fees of any 
kind to be paid. All who wish to try are given the 
same chance, and the selection is left to the coach 
as to who is best fitted for the places. The time and 
place of the next trial Thursday night will be posted 
on the bulletin boards in time for everyone to see. A 
larger turnout of men willing to try for parts is 
wanted, and it is urged that all who have any ability 
along that line or who wish to find out if they have, 
to come out.
PJBPRi YJmpRP%P%JA AAAJLAERH$m RR&OiHT
The committee on production of the White Friars 
having the staging of the play in charge, announce a 
competition for a poster to be used for advertising. 
The design is to be of such a nature that it can be 
used at any time for any show, or in other words, it 
is to be a stock poster to have the lettering inserted 
each time it is used. The committee will announce 
more of the details in connection with the competition 
this week.
REYLAIIING IA$ERIALST
This subject is to those engaged at the present 
time in the stores department of our great railway 
systems, one of the most important ones, and should 
be given a good share of our time in order to help 
bring about economy in operation of the railroad 
with which we are connected. I have no doubt that 
all of the storekeepers have been economizing ever 
since they have followed the business of railroad 
storekeeping, as this is a part of the business, but I 
feel at present and for some time past, we have all 
been compelled to resort to the reclaiming of mate
rials more than ever before, and while so engaged, 
attention has been directed to the scrap pile.
To begin with, a too careful inspection cannot be 
made of materials sent to or unloaded from cars at 
the scrap dock. A considerable portion of the mate
rials that can be reclaimed from the scrap is picked 
up along the right of way, having been dropped or 
torn off of rolling stock and sent in with regular 
roadway scrap, as it is the only way section foremen 
have to dispose of same. It is essential that you 
have competent inspectors to supervise the unloading 
of all scrap sent in, so that every piece that is ser
viceable or can be made serviceable at reasonable 
expense is picked out and properly stored. These 
same inspectors can assist to a great extent in di
recting the proper assorting of the scrap to proper 
classification that will bring the best market price. 
Your inspection is not complete unless your inspec
tors are on hand when scrap is being loaded out, 
thus giving you a double inspection on all scrap 
handled.
As the material reclaimed from the scrap pile is 
rusted more or less, its presence in bins or shelves 
where new material of same kind is stored does not 
give the best of appearance, hence, I strongly rec
ommend that bins, shelves or racks be placed con
venient to your scrap piles for the proper storing of 
such materials; stencil the bins to indicate the name 
of articles stored in same. Storekeepers must be 
instructed to keep in touch with materials reclaimed; 
issue no new material until your reclaimed stock is 
used up. A large percentage of material reclaimed 
from scrap, such as brake levers, brake hangers, 
connection pins, brake shoe keys, carrier irons, fol
lower plates, lever carriers, sill steps, grab iron, 
end gate hooks for coal cars, brake staffs, uncoup
ling levers, knuckle pins, not bent or damaged and 
can be put in your second-hand material bins with
out additional expense.
Every railroad operating a scrap dock should have 
in connection with same a suitable building in which 
there should be a steam hammer, alligator shears and 
a furnace. The hammer is to be used in straight
ening rods of all kinds that can be picked up out of 
the scrap pile, which should be put in iron rack for 
smith shop use; no new iron to be issued until that 
reclaimed from scrap is used up, unless the work for 
which it is intended will not warrant the use of sec

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN
ond-hand iron. In the furnace should be heated such 
articles as king bolts, drawbar stems, and other 
heavy forgings that cannot be straightened cold to 
good advantage. The shears, in addition to cutting 
up old rods to be straightened and then cutting to 
dimension length for smith shop use, can also be 
used to a great advantage in cutting up scrap, as 
there is considerable scrap received, such as draft 
castings, from which it is necessary to remove old 
bolts that are so badly rusted, thus allowing you to 
assort the scrap to proper classification.
In addition to reclaiming forgings from scrap, we 
find a good many castings, such as brake shoes, au
tomatic couplers, knuckles and locking parts, that 
can be used again. It is, of course, essential that 
such articles be inspected closely, making use of 
gauges, so that none of these articles that are worn 
beyond the limit of wear is reclaimed. If this is 
done you will find such reclaimed article continually 
finding their way back to the scrap pile. Do not 
lose sight of the fact that a great many good coupler 
pockets can be removed from the scrap couplers. It 
pays to cut them off. Other castings that can be re
claimed are truss rod stands, brake wheels, truss 
rod washers, ice box drip pans for refrigerator cars, 
stake pockets, side bearings, clevises, pins and links 
and lever brackets used in connection with the un
coupling attachments, and a good many high-priced 
patented articles, such as grain -door fixtures, side 
door fixtures and fasteners, etc., and small pieces, 
such as nuts, washers, and lag screws, help consid
erable in filling up the bins you may have for this 
reclaimed material. All nuts should be taken to 
shops to be re-tapped before placing in your bins.
A great many turnbuckles which are a costly item 
find their way to the scrap pile with stub in them. 
These can easily be reclaimed at small expense by 
putting them into your furnace; removing them well 
heated; placing them in a trough of water. After 
this operation, oil them well and the stub ends are 
easily removed. Drawbar springs that find their 
way to the scrap pile should also be closely inspect
ed. Separate the coils and mate up the good ones. 
While such reclaimed springs may have a little per
manent set, they are practically as good as new for 
the purposes intended.
Another individual item that calls for attention 
is car journal boxes. While the major portion is 
worn out or broken an occasional one will be found 
that can be used again. A large number of these 
oil boxes are thrown in the scrap without having the 
lids removed, and while it is a fact that it may take 
a little time to remove these lids, yet a great saving 
can be effected, even though it may take 15 or 20 
minutes to remove same. The question of reclaiming 
old bolts by having them straightened and threaded 
ends cut off to shorter standard lengths is no doubt 
being practiced by all roailroads. From the accu
mulation of scrap pipe you ought to select enough 
from which practically the whole roads consump
tion of pipe nipples can be made.
5
To users of I beam brake beams, I wish to
say that while you may be straightening
the I beam section, it is still weak and
not as good as when new, but you can at a small
additional expense apply an angle iron section to 
the I beam, thus making the beam stronger than 
before, and preventing the I section from twisting 
which is the general trouble experienced with brake 
beams of this design.
The installation of a small rod mill or re-roller 
adjacent to your scrap docks will prove a profitable 
departure. Old iron rods one inch in diameter and 
over, having surface pitted from rust and exposure 
to the weather which cannot be used in their pres
ent state for any other purpose than scrap can be 
sheared up into billet lengths, placed in a furnace 
used in connection with the rod mill and re-rolled to 
desired diameter. The product of this machine is as 
good as new iron, can be made into bolts or used for 
any purpose in place of new iron. The expense is 
not great, as four men only are required to operate 
same, and will turn out an average of 6,000 pounds 
per day. Labor, fuel and incidentals to operate a 
mill of this kind amounts to about $13 per day, the 
difference in cost of new bar iron and scrap value 
being about $17 per ton, or a net saving of about $40 
per day. In connection with this one must consider 
the convenience of this machine. Should your stock 
or new iron run low you can mange to keep your 
smith shop supplied until your new stock arrives. 
Should you be fortunate in securing an outfit of this 
kind, if you have already got one, you will find that 
.it is indispensable.
If you are using air brake and steam hose pur
chased under guarantee, your force employed in 
stripping old hose must be thoroughly instructed to 
closely watch all hose to see that proper removal 
dates are cut on the hose removed for cause. A lit
tle carelessness in the matter will result in your 
not getting as much reclamation from the manu
facturer for their responsible defects in such hose 
as you are entitled to. This applies to other com
modities as well that have the manufacturers guar
antee back of them.
Another item that may be of some interest to you 
is the reclaiming of paints. By this I mean that all 
the sediments from paint, oil and varnish barrels, 
skins that form on top of receptacles or other paint 
pots used by the painter, also slops from the paint 
stock room. Do not allow this to be thrown away 
with other refuse, but arrange with some point on your 
line where any amount of painting is done to save it 
and when as much as a half-barrel or more is accu
mulated, have it sent in to some headquarters, when 
surplus or scrap material is forwarded, and have it 
made over by emptying into a large tank, arranged 
over a small fireplace with a slow, steady heat. Add 
sufficient raw linseed oil to dissolve skins; allow to 
boil slowly, and when by means of paddle used in 
stirring it, it is evident that all substances are in 
solution, add red oxide of iron in quantity sufficient

to bring color to shade required. This will give you 
a first-class freight car paint at about one-half the 
cost of new paint, and of a quality much better. The 
cost of installing an outfit with tank of about 200 
gallons capacity will be from $40 to $50.
The cost of oil and waste for the lubrication of 
cars and engines runs into enormous figures, so 
much that the officials of railways continually devote 
more or less of their time to the study of reducing 
this cost of operation to a minimum. Also traveling 
engineers and other experts employed by the rail
ways devote their entire time instructing employes 
in the economic use of lubricants.
There are on the market several patented devices 
for use in reclaiming discarded oil and waste from 
journal boxes. These devices are not very expen
sive, and you should try to get one if not now using 
one. I am not a selling agent for any of the manu
facturers, but I know that one of these machines 
can do considerable in the way of reclaiming oil and 
waste. Car oilers and repairers should be instructed 
to save all journal packing, sending same to division 
headquarters in old oil barrels, when sending in the 
accumulation of other scrap on their premises. Oils 
and waste thus reclaimed should be mixed with new 
oils and waste and used for freight car journal pack
ing only.Extract from a paper by E. E. Wilson 
before the Railway Storekeepers Association, Chi
cago, May, 1908.
The following letter is self-explanatory and shows 
that our Glee Club is appreciated:
My Dear Dr. Hamerschlag:
That was certainly a fine crowd of fellows you sent 
to us last Thursday evening and there has never 
before been such an evening at Kingsley House as 
they gave to us. The songs, the spirit, the cheers 
took me back to my college days. In fact, they made 
me feel thoroughly lamerist for my undergraduate 
days. I hope they will come again. I hope also that 
Kingsley House can get more and more in touch with 
your great school. We get pretty lonely up here 
at times, cut off as we are from the university part 
of the term. For we have not forgotten what col
lege companionship means.

A S$REE$ YAR INYIDEN$T
There is a certain man who is known to be at once 
very brilliant and extremely absent-minded. Not 
long ago he was escorting a young lady to the thea
ter, and in his efforts to remember the tickets, dis
covered to his dismay that he had not a cent in his 
pockets for carfare. He found a seat for the girl in
side the car, then followed the conductor to the plat
form for a moment. Reaching across the crowd 
there, he touched the conductor on the shoulder and 
said, you havent returned my change!
How much did you give me? inquired the busy 
conductor.
I gave you a quarter and paid for two, was the 
answer. So the absent-minded fellow had enough 
money to take him home,and he claims that he 
took the conductors number and repaid him the next 
day. Whether he did or not is another story. .

lessened by occasional glimpses of things behind the

poison drinking, and ghost walking, none of us lost 
any sleep over it.

Without a full response, it will be impossible for the 
Athletic Association to complete the field under the 
present plan.
C. C. LEEDS, Treas.,
Room No. 115.
The treasurers statement on this page seems to 
sound the death knell of our Field as proposed, at 
least for this year, and we are forced to fall back on 
the proposition to play our games on a foreign field.
It takes no prophetic eye to see the consternation 
next year when student tickets are no longer good 
at the gate and we are forced to dig at each game. 
For a student body that is so loyal on some occa
sions we have singularly apathetic one on others. 
This was pretty well shown on Monday evening when 
out of fourteen representatives to the Athletic Board 
only four were present. The remaining ten ought 
to attend meetings or resign in favor of ones that 
would.
The editor of the Courant, the University of Pitts
burgh monthly, has wanted to see a statement of the 
Athletic finances of that institution. In order to get 
this statement the Courant has published some edi
torials that are certainly to the point. In a recent 
issue the statement was made that there never had 
been a financial statement of their Athletic commit
tee. The February issue contains an apology for this 
editorial that is a gem and we congratulate the writer 
on his ability to apologize without retracting.
As the spring vacations draws near we naturally 
begin to reflect on the activities of commencement
week. And while we are on that subject would it 
not be well to consider one or two things that might 
make that week less strenuous and at the same time 
make it more enjoyable? Last year everything possi
ble seemed to be bunched in the small compass of 
eight days and these eight days were calculated to 
leave the prospective graduate with an enlarged 
morning after feeling.
Wouldn't it be just as feasible to hold the Senior 
ball at some earlier date and thus relieve the con
gestion and still make it as enjoyable an affair as if 
held later? Even if the Senior class does not look 
favorably on this suggestion at this time, it is one 
well worth thinking over.
If there are any more Hackett or John Drews in 
the school tomorrow night is the time for them to 
come to the front. The White Friars are issuing 
what will probably be the last call for candidates 
and every one hopes they will have as large a turn
out as possible from which to pick the men for this 
seasons show. Mr. Edmundson will have entire 
charge of the selection and this guarantees its fair
ness.
When the try out for the chorus was held the num
ber out for the show was very encouraging, and we 
hope that it will still be so at this which is probably 
about the last call.
The winter months always make it impossible to 
spend as much time out of doors as one would like, 
in this vicinity particularly. The noon hour instead 
of being spent in the park is passed in doors. Lunch
es brought to the buildings are eaten there, and there
by hangs our complaint. There are two classes of 
men in the day school; those who bring lunches and 
those who do not. By far the greater majority of 
the latter patronize the Commons in the middle of 
the day, which is all well and good.
As every one knows, the Commons is anything 
but large enough to accommodate all the men who 
buy their lunch there during the rush hour. Aside 
from being a place where food can be obtained, it is 
supposed to be a place where lunches brought may 
be eaten, whether the person buys anything or not. 
The former class feel that "their presence in the 
Commons in its crowded state, is depriving the lat
ter from the space they have, in a measure paid for. 
The result is that these lunches are carried elsewhere 
to be eaten, and, as we began, at this time of the 
year, that means somewhere in the buildings. Empty

class rooms are used for the purpose, the halls and 
corridors are lined and littered with evidences of the 
fact, and the look of the interior of the .Schools caused 
thereby is not calculated to make a good impression 
on a visitor. Even with the overcrowded Commons 
about half of the refuse could be more properly and 
carefully disposed of. In summer, the park is made 
to suffer, so that is no solution of the difficulty. It 
looks to us as though it will continue more or less

GLEE AND IANDOLIN YLUBST
The preceding week has been a period of reaction 
for the members of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs, 
after their strenuous times in connection with the 
Annual Concert. The events of the week were the 
visits of the Clubs to Kingsley House on Thursday 
evening, and to the Lawrenceville Playgrounds on 
Saturday evening. At the first mentioned place, the
usual program was performed to the immense satis
faction of all concerned. A large crowd was in at
tendance and the applause was generous. Upon re
turning to the dressing rooms a set up of cake and 
lemonade ws discovered. This was followed by danc
ing, to music furnished by the Kingsley Orchestra. 
Some very good dancers were discovered and the 
fellows enjoyed themselves heartily.
Breathing space was at a premium in the Assembly 
Hall at Lawrenceville Playgrounds on Saturday night. 
The concert given by the men was highly appreciated. 
The dance that followed was short but joyful and the 
evening was thoroughly enjoyed.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs give a concert in Mc
Keesport on March 12th for the Y. M. C. A. of that 
place. The concert is being well advertised. A num
ber of other dates are in prospect.

SEYOND YEAR INDUS$RIALST
On Friday the lecturer in Hygiene failed to appear, 
so we held what proved to be the most enthusiastic 
and profitable class meeting of the year. It was 
unanimously voted to have a class banquet Thursday, 
March 4. The committee in charge have completed 
arrangements and it promises to be quite an elabor
ate affair. Practically all of the class have signified 
their intention of attending.
Hon. William Jennings Bryan will be in town that 
evening and the committee on entertainment has 
extended him an invitation to say a few words to us, 
and have also taken it up with prominent Bryanites 
here in Pittsburgh. Two motor cars have been 
offered to bring Mr. Bryan to the Rittenhouse.
Members of the faculty will be the important 
speakers. A number of the popular pieces have been 
made over into class songs so that the evening 
promises to be a tuneful one. Everything has pro
gressed so finefy that already the night of Inaugura
tion Day looks like a big one for Tech.
The Prep, section of the class has elected R. K. 
Chrisman manager of their base ball team, and hope 
the other sections will thus organize teams. It is 
only by practice that we are going to make The 
Second Year Industrial Team the best in the schools. 
Spring is here and that inter-class championship is 
something worth working for.
$HE IAN OF $HE HOURT
Who is the man of the hour? Ill tell you. It is 
our old friend Chussy. He is still in Pittsburg. 
His time between nights and Sundays is not misspent. 
At night he dreams of Dear Old Tech (not Tech 
beer); while his Sundays are spent teaching. Yes! It 
is true, he has a class at Sunday-school. It is a class 
of boys. They are never late, have no unexcused abscences, and never cut. They are all happy, for they 
feel that they are being trained in the way they should 
go. Tech is their slogan. When this wave of di
rected intelligence reaches us, Sir Thomas Moores 
ideal no place will become a reality. All hail our 
old friend Chussy, the man of the hour!

LIGNI$E AS A FUELT
To adapt locomotives to the use of lignite fuel 
throughout extensive sections of the South and cen
tral West has required certain modifications of ordin
ary designs. Grates, nettings, nozzles and ashpans 
cannot be fitted for the use of either bituminous 
coal or lignite at will, and it is with somewhat indif
ferent success that these parts have been specially 
designed for the burning of the latter class of fuel. 
A locomotive fire fed with lignite has never been a 
dependable quantity to the extent that dead engines 
often result from an attempt to make a grade with 
the valves at late cut-off and a fire of the customary 
thickness. It is not unusual for the grates to be 
swept from the flue sheet to the door under these 
conditions, in spite of the care of the fireman. It is 
not necessary to state that all the troubles of a very 
light fuel, the quality of which differs with each 
tender filling, have emanated from the use of lignite 
as a locomotive fuel. It is not surprising, in view 
of these facts, that oil has been substituted at an in
creased annual fuel expenditure, but decreased loss 
due to engine failures on several railroad divisions in 
the lignite territories. With the increase in railroad 
mileage and, therefore, of fuel consumption within 
this territory, the cost of oil or bituminous coal trans
portation is such as to demand the installation of 
combustion apparatus which will burn lignite with 
better results than have heretofore been attained. 
Several locomotives entailing radically new designs 
in firebox and front end construction have been built 
and are being tried out in service in the West. It is 
to be hoped that the operation of these engines will 
be such as to open the way to a profitable solution of 
the difficulty. When this is the case it will, perhaps, 
be possible to go farther and produce a means for 
burning the poorer qualities of this fuel, of which 
there is such a vast supply at hand. There are in 
New Mexico, for instance, a very large number of 
deposits of lignite which are of indifferent quality, 
but which, it would seem, will at some time be put 
to use, and as the railroads are by far the greatest 
users of fuel in this unsettled country, these deposits 
stand only a small chance of being worked until the
lignite-burning locomotive creates a demand.The 
Railroad and Engineering Review.
PREPST
In the regular monthly meeting of the Day Preps., 
it was resolved that they have base ball and track 
teams. In view of this resolution the following men 
were elected:
Crisman, manager base ball, and acting captain 
until the team is formed.
Crawford, manager track team.
Sutherin, captain track team.
Meets may be arranged with Crisman or Crawford. 
Let us hear from you.
Ask Crisman about his Sunday School class.

The price of the book is $1.50 of which fifty cents is 
payable at the time of subscription and the balance 
on receipt of the book. If you wish a book, sub

A POOR YI$IZENT
He stood around from morn to night 
With corrugated brow,
And talked to other loafers near 
The while he told them how 
There was a more successful way 
The country could be run,
Though lending his assistance was 
A thing hed never done.
So many were the theories 
He hastened to expound 
That any way to earn his salt 
As yet he hadnt found.
His wife kept boarders, paid the bills 
The children sent to school,
While all her husband wished to know 
Was, Shall the people rule?
A chap like that should get the ax,
Or else a dose of lead
Who claims he hasnt time, forsooth,
To earn his daily bread.
Ten cents would be a famous price 
To pay for such as he,
An empty fraud who cant contrive 
To fed his familee!

DIPLOIAYYT
In the days when I was youthful 
(I am far from youthful now)
. I determined to be truthful 
And I sealed it with a vow;
But my head they do not batter 
For the things that I may say,
As -I try to put the matter 
In a diplomatic way.
If a lady asks you plainly
If you think shes looking old,
If her bulk is not ungainly,
Still no falsehood need be told.
You may think her aged and fatter 
But its not the thing to say,
You must try to put the matter 
In a diplomotic way.
If a persons not veracious 
Do not tell him that he lies,
Its a phrase thats most ungracious 
And results in blackened eyes.
I dont say that you should flatter 
But youll always find it pay 
If you try to put the matter 
In a diplomatic way.

FIRS$ YEAR INDUS$RIALS BANQUE$T
The First Year Industrials held their class banquet 
at the Colonial Annex, February 25th, and it proved 
to be a rather undecided success.
Thirty-seven of the students, together with eleven 
members of the Faculty ssembled in the spacious 
banquet hall. No doubt it was this small turnout 
that was responsible for the indifferent success of the 
evening. Nevertheless those present did the best 
they could to enjoy themselves and departed early 
for their homes and mothers. '
Billy Finkel, the class secretary acted as toast
master and really came near making a success of it.
The following members of the Faculty responded 
with songs, stories and speeches:
Mr. C. B. ConnellyA short talk on class spirit at 
Tech.
Mr. J. F. Morris.
Mr. Chas. DayVarsity Hockey Coach.
Mr. SchaefferVarsity Basket-ball Coach.
Mr. HamiltonAbout his collection of ties.
Mr. Smith.
Mr. Hepburn.
Mr. BirgeA fish storyas usual.
Mr. Pfodts.
Mr. Taylor.
Mr. SchumakerA new joke? ?
Mr. Doseylong DoseyA song without words.
The following also responded:

H. A. Silverman.
J. Spandau.
Lefty Harrison.
T. C. Snyder.
R. T. Kinter.
King Ewing.
McMurry.
F. Dolin.
Dunn.
Mayo Fitzhughs recitation in the negro dialect 
was very well done and showed his keen knowledge 
of that race.
The features of the evening were the marching 
of banqueters around the hall, the cheering of the 
Faculty under Mr. C. B. Connelly (it didnt hurt Mr. 
Connelly as he was on top), and the piano playing 
of Mr. Raubischoen, a U. of P. graduate, who compositained us with a few selections of his own composi
tion.
The banquet broke up at an early hour by the 
singing (?) of our Alma Mater.

The February meeting of the Civil Engineering 
Society was held Saturday evening. Nearly all the 
actual members were present. Professor .Foss gave 
an illustrated lecture on Kites and Kite Flying. 
The U. S. Government has for a number of years used 
kites in connection with its observatories and weath
er bureaus. Instruments for recording wind velo
city, humidity, and altitude are sent up by this means. 
It is not unusual for them to ascend four or five 
miles. After the lecture the commissary depart
