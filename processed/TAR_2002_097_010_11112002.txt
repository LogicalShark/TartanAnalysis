Architect curriculum 
stressful in early years
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
Christian DAndrea sat in studio 
one Sunday afternoon two weeks 
ago. The first-year architects hands 
became numb and the lines on the 
paper in front of him began to blur. 
Feeling dizzy and short of breath, 
DAndrea put his pencil down. Unable 
to calm his racing heart, he returned 
to his room and tried to sleep it off.
My doctor said it was an anxiety 
attack brought on by stress, said 
DAndrea. He says that I also have a 
heart condition called heart mur
mur.
Heart murmur occurs when the 
heart valve does not shut tightly or 
open fully. As a result, blood leaks 
backwards or has no room to flow at 
a normal rate.
DAndrea had a lot to do that week: 
pledge obligations, numerous read
ings for world history, staff for the 
Ben Folds concert, and two assign
ments for architecture due that 
Sunday.
He had an anxiety attack once in 
high school but doctors dismissed it 
as nothing serious. Even after the 
attack, he continued to actively par
ticipate in school work and athletics, 
but now his doctor prohibits him 
from joining the track team at CMU.
It was the workload from architec
ture that triggered it, said DAndrea. 
It wouldnt have been that bad if I 
was doing work for other classes.
Now, a sinus infection from his 
medication had put him behind in his 
work. Even with an extension, 
DAndrea said he still had to work 
hard and consistently to catch up.
Most first-year students in archi
tecture will concur with DAndrea 
about the workload and stress of the 
first semester in the five-year 
Bachelors of Architecture Programis.
Akil Simon, another first-year 
architect, says that he and most of his 
peers spend 35-40 hours at studio. 
All-nighters are common because 
classes end at 4:30 pm and there is 
only time in the evening.
I spend my whole weekend at stu
dio, said Tom Dziarmaga, also a 
first-year in architecture. We might 
as well have classes on Saturdays and
Sundays.
Most students will set aside an 
ample amount of hours to work on 
their projects but they say it is never 
enough.
We could work 24 hours straight 
and still not run out of stuff to work 
on, said Sean Houghton, a first-year 
architect. Were done with a project 
when we run out of time.
The projects are not as easy as just 
drawing straight lines or gluing sticks 
together. The first-year curriculum 
consists of three main courses: stu
dio, computer modeling, and draw
ing.
Studio assigns and collects every 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 
said Dan Cohen, also a first-year 
architect. Friday assignments are 
handed out at 4:30 pm and due 
Sunday at 10 pm. Its awful because 
these assignments are continuous 
and simultaneous. You want to be 
creative but theres no time. If I had 
more time it could be so much better 
and I would also enjoy myself a lot 
more while working.
Students rush to finish before the 
deadline. Every hour is precious.
Ive been sleeping on the lounge 
couch for the past three nights, said 
Cohen. I dont have time to go home 
because I live off campus; anyway, its 
a big pain to go home at 5 am. I live 
here at Maggie Mo. This is my home.
Dziarmaga said he averaged about 
two hours of sleep per night this past 
week. 
Students not only have to adjust to 
a different sleeping schedule but also 
to a different diet, it seems. Simon 
said that he had to switch meal plans 
because there would always be 
blocks left over.
There is no time for breakfast, 
lunch is later in the day after studio 
ends at 4:30, and dinner is around 
midnight.
Amid the busy life at Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall, the firstyears also have to juggle academic 
courses outside the architecture cur
riculum.
Classes are constantly missed, 
said Cohen. I only went to four world 
history lectures for the first half of the 
semester.

Henderson renovations displace residents
Brad Yankiver/Assistant Photo Editor
Veronique Lee, a first-year resident of the soon-to-be-renovated Henderson house, points to a poster detailing the lottery 
determining where first-years will get relocated after the move. The lottery is based on preferences and availability.
by Alicia Sanderman
Staffwriter
As part of a renovation plan that 
has spanned seven years, the 
University will expand Henderson 
House during the spring semester. 
Henry Hornbostel originally 
designed the 85-year old dormitory, 
during his term as University archi
tect, but now the floors slant, the 
stairs groan with every step, and the 
mechanical and heating systems are
all but worn out.
The scope of the $3.85 million 
project prohibited Housing from 
squeezing construction into the sum
mer months. Instead, all current res
idents will depart their Henderson 
dorm rooms before the spring 
semester. They will be assigned a 
new room according to their prefer
ences, by lottery. Housing will pro
vide a moving truck to help students 
transfer their belongings.
Students living in Henderson can 
either retain their current room or
one of the 40 Henderson non-firstyear rooms for next fall. Housing 
advised residents of the displace
ment before last room draw.
[They] have an additional choice 
that other students dont have, said 
Adria Greene, the coordinator of 
assignment operations for Housing 
Services. She encouraged students 
to stay with campus housing, 
because campus housing later is not 
guaranteed for students who move 
off campus.
The construction process will gut
the wooden interior and rebuild it 
with concrete and steel. According to 
University architect Paul Tellers, the 
revised building will maintain the 
current look, but will include an 
additional floor on top of the exist
ing brick and stone walls. The reno
vations will net 20 extra beds in the 
fall. Besides more space, Henderson 
will have an elevator, a full set of 
sprinklers, smoke and heat detec
tors, air conditioning, an updated 
electrical system, and Category 5 
cabling (for Ethernet connectivity). 
As part of the Universitys move 
towards green building practices, 
Henderson will comply with leader
ship in energy and environmental 
design standards. For example, the 
carpeting includes only recycled 
materials.
It will be safer, accessible, and 
fully modern, said Tim Michael, 
director of Housing Services.
Michael said the new design 
moves the entrance half a floor 
lower, so that people will enter on 
the ground floor. This floor will 
maintain the same facilities, which 
include a fitness center, a dining 
room, TV area, and recreation room, 
but in a different layout. The other 
floors will remain arranged in suites: 
either two doubles or a double and a 
single sharing a private bathroom. 
Also, construction workers will 
install windows at both ends of the 
hallway.
The University also plans to relay 
Henderson and Welch House walk
ways in brick and Widen them to 
accommodate vehicles. The new 
sidewalks will mark the beginning of 
the master landscaping plan for the 
hill dormitories. Michael said plans 
also exist for a brick terrace with

Child care leave policy 
differs for faculty, staff
by Alida Sanderman
Staffwriter
Some couples prefer sex at night 
or in the morning, but for others, its 
the season that counts. Many fami
lies that must schedule their babys 
due date around work, struggle to 
find appropriate day care after an 
adoption or when their children are 
born.
To reduce the hassle for faculty 
members, Faculty Senate and 
Provost Mark Kamlet developed the 
Faculty Parental Leave of Absence 
Policy.
Since CMU adopted the policy 
last January, both male and female 
faculty can take leave. Prior to 
CMUs policy, the federal govern
ment guaranteed some benefits 
under the Family Medical Leave Act 
of 1993, which is the current policy 
for all staff members.
According to Carnegie Mellons 
policy, a faculty member including a 
lecturer, a researcher, or a scholar 
who is the parent of a newborn 
child, or who has adopted a child of 
pre-school age, and who is the pri
mary caregiver of the child, is enti
tled to a one semester paid leave of 
absence.
The policy gives faculty a number 
of rights during their leave.
For example, faculty can require 
the University to continue classes,
research, and other duties of the 
absent professor. Faculty can also 
choose to freeze their tenure sched
ule, since progress towards guaran
teed permanence at the University 
depends on timetable of require
ments. While the revisions are great 
for academics, it creates an unwel
come disparity between faculty and 
staff.
The whole idea that we as facul
ty are more important than staff 
bothers me, said Rachel Youngs, a 
senior lecturer in French. We just 
have different jobs. I couldnt func
tion as a faculty person without the 
support of the staff, and the staff 
wouldnt have a job if there were not 
faculty.
The federal policy that covers 
staff requires covered employers to 
provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, 
job-protected leave to eligible 
employees for certain family and 
medical reasons.
Employees are eligible if they 
have worked for a covered employer 
for a minimum of one year, and for 
1,250 hours over the previous 12 
months.
If a woman on staff at CMU wants 
to take a paid leave of absence to 
have her child, she must use either 
Paid Time Off (PTO) and/or 
Reserved Sick Days (RSD), though 
a couple would have to plan for

Tech transfer plays belated role at Carnegie Mellon
Records galore
Pillbox, 10
by Andrew Johnson
News Editor
A chill permeates the room, 
unabated by the broken heater. The 
technician said he will fix the heater 
by next Friday. Until then, Craig 
Markovitz will just have to unpack 
boxes in the cold.
Most chief executive officers dont 
have to address heating issues with 
their landlords or even unpack loads 
of boxes, but Markovitz is not your 
average corporate chieftain. Hes the 
head of a fledgling spin-off, 
CASurgica, brewed out of CMU tech
nology.
This sort of academic corporation 
is actually relatively new to both 
business and colleges, a fact often 
overlooked in the ubiquity of the dot
com rise and fall.
Federal law and the Internet, not 
academic musings, first beckoned 
university researchers from their 
lofty abode in the 1980s. Until 1980, 
university research around the coun
try had a hard time finding its way 
into corporate America. Much of the 
grant money utilized by faculty came
directly from the federal govern
ment, which meant the government 
would always have its finger in the 
facultys research pie. The few excep
tions to this rule stemmed from a 
lengthy petition process.
The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 
changed all that, encouraging eco
nomic prosperity by allowing exclu
sive licensing of technology. Not only 
could researchers and universities 
more easily obtain exclusive licens
es, but the shift also led colleges to 
develop programs to support their 
new capability. Technology trans
fer offices popped up in universities 
from coast to coast as a result of the 
legislation. These offices attempt to 
license technology from the universi
ty to faculty or companies to get aca
demic research out into the general 
population. But it seems the 1980s 
passed CarnegieMellon by.
Playing catch-up
We started a formal [technology 
transfer] office a lot later than many 
other universities, said Christina 
Gabriel, vice provost.
According to a 1999 report by the
Council on Governmental Relations 
about the triumph of the Bayh-Dole 
Act, membership in the leading tech 
transfer community (Association of 
University Technology Managers) 
grew from 113 in 1979 to 691 in 
1989.
Yet, CMU remained aloof from the 
commercial world until computer 
science professor Eric Cooper co
founded FORE Systems in 1990. 
Brenda Hetrick, marketing manager 
of the Universitys current tech trans
fer incarnation, said FORE Systems 
drove CMU into the tech transfer 
field, though CMU held no equity in 
the eventually $4.5 billion dollar 
company. By the time FORE Systems 
went public in 1994, CMU had taken 
its first step into the tech transfer 
world.
In 1992, CMU trustee and former 
corporate CEO Benno Bernt founded 
the Technology Transfer Program 
and took Carnegie Mellon from 
being ranked 78th to eighth in tech
nology transfer services during his 
five-year term as director. CMUs 
explosive charge through the rank
ing is due in no small part to com
puter science professor Michael
Mauldins brainchild, Lycos.
The little spider that could
The search engine, named for a 
wolf spider, generated a tremendous 
amount of revenue for the 
University. The University has real
ized roughly $60 million in capital 
gains and royalties on its commercial 
equities, and Lycos accounted for a 
whopping 80 percent .of those funds. 
When CMU finally divested its inter
ests in Lycos in 1997, the proceeds 
had completely funded NewellSimon Hall, with a bit left over for 
professor fellowships.
Lycos meant many things to the 
University besides a new building, 
though. Only 10 months after its 
foundation, the company became 
the youngest to join the NASDAQ. 
Mauldin sought out business help 
from the private sector, and the rest 
is a history of fast money, a tumul
tuous war of search engines, and a 
quick divestment by CMU.
With perfect hindsight, one can 
fault the University for how fast it

Pakistani elections 
provoke concern
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  He 
won big in last months elections on 
an anti-American ticket, has called
- Osama bin Laden a holy warrior and 
..counts Taliban leader Mullah 
J Mohammed Omar among his friends
 and he could be Pakistans next 
v prime minister.
, Fazl-ur Rahman has sharply critih cized President Pervez Musharrafs 
, support for the United States and its 
, war on terror. And while Musharraf 
will keep a strong grip on power no 
 matter who is prime minister, a 
Rahman government would likely 
bring stormy tensions within the 
leadership of a key US ally.
A coalition of pro-democracy 
> groups and Rahmans own religious 
, bloc holds enough seats to form 
 Pakistans next government, and it 
.has already tentatively nominated 
Rahman for the premiership.
In Pakistani politics, horsetrading 
is a tradition, and Musharraf will like
ly try to keep Rahman out of office,
- v knowing he will not be welcomed by 
, Washington.
, Even if Musharraf is unable to do 
so, he retains considerable control. 
Prior to the October 10 elections, 
Musharraf amended the constitution 
to give himself the power to fire the 
prime minister and dissolve parlia
ment.
- , But the general, who came to 
power in a 1999 military coup, has 
pledged to step back and let the legis
lature take over day-to-day governing
-. of the country. He had billed the elec
tions as an important return to 
.democracy, but voters used the occa- ,sion to rebuke him and give surprisr ingly strong support to religious par
ities, such as Rahmans, who ran on a
- pro-Taliban ticket.
-,  A moderate Muslim, Musharraf is 
, certain to worry that Rahmans image 
could sabotage efforts to attract for
eign investment to this poor nation of 
"140 million people. Pakistans stock 
market plunged after the parties 
named Rahman as a potential prime 
minister on Tuesday.
Rahman hasnt said whether he 
will ask the US troops to leave 
Pakistan if he becomes prime minis
ter, but his followers certainly have.
He is also close to Libya. Rahman 
has met with Libyan leader 
Moammar Gadhafi and according to 
western intelligence and members of
his own party, who asked not to be 
identified, his group, Jamiat-e-Ulema 
Islam (Party of Islamic Clerics), has 
received money from Libya.
For Musharraf, an ideal govern
ment is said to be a national unity 
government of his supporters  the 
Pakistan Muslim League, QuaideAzam group  and former prime 
minister Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan 
Peoples Party with Amin Fahim, a 
western-educated Bhutto loyalist, at 
the helm. But there are no guarantees 
Musharraf can outmaneuver the reli
gious right. Bhuttos party currently is 
supporting the coalition with the 
Islamic factions.
There are only two strong institu
tions in Pakistan, the military and the 
mullahs (clerics), said Talat 
Massoud, a retired Pakistani general.
Pakistan has been the US-led coali
tions frontline ally in the war next 
door in Afghanistan. But US intelli
gence says many of the top Taliban 
leaders have taken refuge in Pakistan, 
as have several al Qaida fugitives. The 
two top al Qaida men in US custody
 Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi 
Binalshibh  were arrested in 
Pakistan. Zubaydah is considered the 
terrorist organizations number three 
leader, and Binalshibh one of the 
planners of the September 11 attacks.
12 killed in fire on 
French train blaze
NANCY, France (AP) A fire on an 
overnight train in eastern France 
filled a sleeping car with deadly 
smoke Wednesday, killing 12 people
 including five Americans from the 
same family  and driving panicked 
passengers to smash windows and 
jump to safety.
The train, like others in Europe, 
had no smoke detectors, even though 
cigarette smoking is allowed in desig
nated cars.
Fatal rail accidents are rare in 
France, where trains are known for 
speed, safety, and efficiency. 
Accidents, however, are not unknown 
in Europe: A high-speed train 
derailed in Germany in 1998, killing 
101 people.
Wednesdays blaze, which also 
injured nine people, was initially 
blamed on an electrical short circuit. 
But the French rail authority SNCF 
said that was premature and the 
cause was under investigation.
The owner of the sleeping car, 
German national railroad Deutsche 
Bahn, said the fire apparently started 
in the compartment of a train atten
dant. Smoke was blamed for the 
deaths.
Fed may need to 
further cut rates
WASHINGTON (AP)  After the 
Federal Reserve tried boosting the 
wheezing economy with an interest 
rate cut for the first time this year, 
private economists offered mixed 
opinions on whether more may be 
needed.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and his colleagues on 
Wednesday prescribed a half-per
centage point reduction to the federal 
funds rate, the Feds main lever for 
influencing the economy. That 
pushed the funds rate, the interest 
that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans, to a 41-year low of 
1.25 percent.
In response, some commercial 
banks lowered their prime lending 
rate  a benchmark for many con
sumer loans  by a similar half-point 
to 4.25 percent, the lowest rate since 
1959.
By lowering short-term interest 
rates, federal policy-makers hope to 
motivate anxious consumers to spend 
more and wary businesses to invest 
more, energizing economic growth.
I think the Fed recognized that the 
consumer is getting near the end of 
their rope, said economist David 
Jones, author of Unlocking the Secrets 
of the Fed.
The Fed said Wednesdays rate 
reduction should prove helpful as 
the economy works its way through 
this current soft spot.
With interest rates already at low 
levels all year long, some private 
economists wondered whether 
Americans would rush out on a major 
buying binge. But many believed the 
rate reduction would provide con
sumers and businesses with a muchneeded psychological boost, reducing 
the odds that they would sharply cut 
spending and investment and throw 
the economy into a tailspin.
Consumers are hanging in there, 
but with increasingly less conviction, 
said Mark Zandi, chief economist at 
Economy.com. They are continuing 
to buy if given what they consider to 
be once-in-a-lifetime deals, but other
wise they are very cautious and think
ing about pulling back further.
Bush criticized for 
stance on torture
UNITED NATIONS (AP)  As the 
UN General Assembly begins final 
debate on a measure to allow interna
tional monitoring of prisons to pre
vent torture, human rights groups are 
accusing the United States of diluting 
its effectiveness by blocking funding.
In July, the United States failed to 
muster enough support to block a UN 
vote on the measure aimed at enforc
ing the 1989 UN treaty on torture. 
The United States is one of about 130 
countries that have ratified the treaty, 
but it opposes the protocol that a 
committee of legal experts in the 
General Assembly will start debating 
on Thursday.
We consider the inspection 
process flawed and we have concerns 
over the financing of the protocol, a 
US official said Wednesday. We 
dont think the protocol will enhance 
the work of the existing Committee 
Against Torture.
The Geneva-based committee 
receives reports from alleged torture 
victims and issues policy recommen
dations to countries.
Human rights advocates argue that 
the protocol is essential to enforce the 
International Convention against 
Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
Countries are supposed to enforce the 
convention on their own, but rights 
groups say monitoring is needed 
because torture is still prevalent.
United States said parts of the plan 
were incompatible with the US 
Constitution. Among the US con
cerns was language that could allow 
for visits to US prisons and to terror 
suspects being held by the military.

Primate research 
thrives at Duke U.
DURHAM, N.C. (U-WIRE)  To 
see to the core of the human biolo
gy and behavior, one effective 
method is to study our closest living 
relatives. That approach represents 
the philosophy behind the Duke 
University Primate Centers 
research efforts and an increasing 
number of scientists developing 
their research there.
The Primate Center houses the 
largest collection of endangered 
primates in the world, including the 
largest collection of prosimians - 
humans furthest-removed primate 
cousins. It gives researchers the 
rare opportunity to work with 
prosimians in a natural setting and 
gives humans in general a wider 
perspective on our place in nature.
The Primate Center gives us a 
chance to look at parallel evolution 
between humans and prosimians, 
said William Hylander, director of 
the center and professor of biology 
and biological anthropology and 
anatomy. We can view prosimians 
as a starting point for the evolution 
of higher primates and an endpoint 
for what the earliest primates 
looked like.
Researchers from all over the 
world apply every year to come to 
the center, sometimes just for the 
summer, to test their hypotheses. 
Since 2001, at least 42 new research 
protocols have become active at the 
center, Hylander said.
The new protocols are helping 
the center satisfy one of the 
Universitys main priorities for it; 
last year, the administration 
replaced the centers director and 
raised the possibility of closing the 
center if it did not increase its 
research.
Ongoing research at the Primate 
Center includes studies of locomo
tion and chewing, hormones and 
behavior, digestion, anatomy, the 
evolution of color vision, olfaction 
and learning,
The Primate Center provides me 
with another way to develop ques
tions derived from field research, 
said Diane Brockman. Brockman is 
the assistant research professor of 
biological anthropology and anato
my. Brockmans research is typical 
of the kind of projects that are 
occurring at the center.
When she came to Duke in 1995, 
she had been interested in pursuing 
issues involving reproductive com
petition in Verreauxs sifaka, a 
species of prosimian, and had done 
most of her research in Madagascar, 
the home of most of the worlds 
prosimians.
After studying the Coquerels 
sifaka, a subspecies of Verreauxs 
sifaka, at the Primate Center and 
finding out that adult females 
reproductively suppress their 
daughters, Brockman expanded her 
research efforts to try to determine 
whether Coquerels sifaka is the 
only subspecies of sifaka that 
exhibits this type of behavior.
Since the Primate Center houses 
a diversity of species, researchers 
can test the behavior of one species 
or subspecies against the behavior 
of another.

Looking Ahead
Holocaust story 
recounted at Kent
KENT, OHIO (U-WIRE)  About 
80 Kent State University students 
gathered last night to hear Max 
Edelmans story. Edelman is a sur
vivor of the holocaust, and spoke to 
students in order to share painful, 
but important, memories. The 
speech was co-sponsored by the 
Hillel Jewish Student Center, the 
Lake Hall residence hall council and 
PRIDE! Kent.
Edelman, born in central Poland, 
became a prisoner of the concentra
tion camps in 1939 at the age of 17 
and was not liberated until 1945.
It is difficult to talk about and 
remember, painful even, but we 
must talk about it and remember 
it, he said.
Edelman urged students not to let 
the world forget.
The public opinion (at the time) 
was complacency and indifference, 
he said. Six million Jews were 
killed in the Holocaust. The Nazis 
mode of operation was intimidation 
and fear.
On September 9,1939 the Nazis 
surrounded my house. I entered 
Budzyn concentration camp. 
Edelman went on to describe, in 
shocking detail, an ordinary day in 
the camp.
There were 3,000 of us, all 
Jews, he said. We got up at 5 am 
everyday. Some did not get up; they 
were stiff so we just left them there 
for the clean up crew. They made us 
dig a ditch, that is where we threw 
the corpses.
Pittsburgh animal 
shelters wont kill
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Three shel
ters that take in most of Pittsburghs 
unwanted pets plan to join other 
facilities around the country and 
adopt a no-kill philosophy by 2005, 
vowing to find a home for most ani
mals and to euthanize only danger
ous or seriously ill animals.
But some shelters that have 
stopped euthanizing healthy and 
trainable animals said the task is 
more difficult than it sounds. Packed 
shelters and high operating costs 
arent uncommon, animal caretakers 
said.
Its also a contentious issue within 
the animal welfare community 
nationally, said Martha Armstrong, 
vice president for companion animals 
and equine protection at the Humane 
Society of the United States. Some 
shelters have stopped using the term 
no kill because it is misleading and 
divisive, she said.
Its easy to say we dont kill ani
mals, but someone in the neighbor
hood does. Someone is always going 
to be the bad guy, Armstrong said.
There are about 4,000 animal con
trol agencies in the United States, 
Armstrong estimated, and of those, 
600 to 700 call themselves no-kill 
facilities. Pittsburghs largest shelters 
 the Animal Rescue League of 
Western Pennsylvania, the Western 
Pennsylvania Humane Society and 
Animal Friends  agreed in January 
2000 to work together to not eutha
nize pets unless it was unavoidable.
Although its not a city initiative, 
the move would ostensibly make 
Pittsburgh a no-kill city, because the 
shelters have relationships with the 
city, said Dave Young, a spokesman 
with the Animal Rescue League. 
Animal Friends has been a no-kill 
shelter since its 1943 inception and 
the other shelters are on their way to 
meeting their goal within two and a 
half years, Young said.
Its taking five years to adopt the 
philosophy because the shelters had 
to boost adoption rates, said Barb 
Golden, a spokeswoman with the 
Western Pennsylvania Humane 
Society.
City film office to 
be investigated
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Investigators 
from Los Angeles searched the 
Pittsburgh Film Office for tens of 
thousands of dollars of public money 
supposedly misused by a Los Angeles 
group attempting to bring movie and 
television productions to Southern 
California. LA investigators used a 
warrant on Tuesday in Pittsburgh as 
part of a criminal probe into the scan
dal at the Entertainment Industry 
Development Corp., said John 
Gisleson, an attorney for the 
Pittsburgh Film Office. Prosecutors 
have launched an investigation into 
whether Entertainment Industry 
Development officials abused public 
funds. The Pittsburgh company was 
given $20,000 in donations from the 
Entertainment Industry Development 
Corp. But Gisleson said the 
Pittsburgh agency cooperated with 
the investigation and no officials have 
been charged with wrongdoing.
In the next few weeks, the gov
ernment of Greece will submit

media and the televised coverage of

accused of being members of the

be held in accordance with the new 
law, stated Justice Minister 
Philippos Petsalnikos.
There has been mixed reaction 
to a controversial move by the 
eThekwini municipality in South 
Africa to evict indigent families who 
fail to settle their rental arrears and 
relocate them to cheaper, low-cost 
houses.
Brandon Pillay, chairman of the 
Bayview Flat Residents Association, 
said the council would be meeting 
us head on if they went ahead with 
their plan.
We are not going to allow our 
people to be forcefully relocated, 
because they have been removed 
five or six times in their lives 
already, said Pillay.

Student stuck in 
elevator, fined
COLUMBIA, S.C. (U-WIRE)  A 
University of South Carolina stu
dent stuck in an apartment eleva
tor for two hours is now accused of 
vandalism by the apartment build
ings management and its insur
ance company.
Aurovinda Gangam, a USC grad
uate student studying computer 
science, might face up to $10,000 
in damage charges from Whaleys 
Mill Apartments insurer Atlantic 
Mutual. Gangam forced open the 
elevator doors at the Whaleys Mill 
Apartments at Whaley and Main 
streets, causing damage that the 
Columbia Police Department 
described as malicious injury to 
personal property.
I thought they would get it 
repaired, and I thought, Im study
ing, so I dont want to get involved 
in all the legal business. But later 
he was saying since the door got 
damaged, I have to pay, Gangam
said. I was a victim, he said. I 
was stuck up in the elevator for 
two hours, and after that, they 
asked me to pay.
Chris Carter, a manager at the 
apartment building, said that 
although the Whaley's Mill man
agement does acknowledge that 
Gangam was stuck in an elevator 
for two hours, witnesses  includ
ing a technician who helped free 
Gangam and Whaleys Mill night 
manager John Miller  say 
Gangam violently damaged the 
elevator door.
Carter said the door was dam
aged so badly, parts had to be 
remade.
The door closure was complete
ly bent; one of the light bulbs was 
out; the door was hanging partway 
down the elevator shaft, he said. 
The elevator technician reported 
that the elevator had been vandal
ized; it was severely damaged. 
Gangam rang the emergency 
bell and screamed for help, he 
said, but began to panic when no 
one answered his calls.
I was feeling breathless slightiy, 
and I started to panic, and I was 
sweating, he said.

Pittsburgh higher education in brief
Cohon tells staff 
they are satisfied
During his annual address to staff 
members last Wednesday afternoon 
in McConomy Auditorium, President 
Jared Cohon cited a survey stating 
that 75 percent of Carnegie Mellon 
staff plan on staying at the University 
for three or more years.
Were doing well, said Cohon, 
explaining that the staff retention 
rate at CMU is higher than at other 
major universities.
Questions of construction, renova
tions, and the use of building space 
came up frequently during the meet
ing. Cohon also addressed concerns 
about the Universitys lack of central
ized control over classroom space.
There are benefits to allowing 
departments to control space, said 
Cohon, adding that the current sys
tem makes rooms easily accessible on 
short notice. He also discussed the 
problem of classroom shortages and 
noted that the renovation of Doherty 
Hall will make two new classrooms 
available.
Cohon spoke about the Universitys 
master plan for construction, which 
calls for a number of significant 
changes to campus including the 
transformation of the Morewood 
parking lot into an underground 
garage and athletic fields, and the 
razing of some fraternity buildings.
While we define what we want the 
future to look like, weve got no plan 
yet, and no schedule to do that, said 
Cohon. Its not going to happen any
time soon.
Some audience members brought 
up cases of staff mistreatment by fac
ulty members and said that they were 
made to feel like second class citi
zens.
Cohon addressed this issue in a 
later interview.
Its not acceptable if in fact facul
ty behaved towards staff the way staff 
claimed they did. This is something
we should not allow to continue, he 
said.Business students 
compete and win
Four CMU MBA students Were 
awarded the highly prestigious and 
competetive International
Operations Management Case 
Competition last Saturday. The tour
nament consisted of teams from 18 of 
the top MBA programs in the nation, 
battling one another in a 21-hour 
competition.
We are thrilled that we continue 
to dominate other management pro
grams in the highly specialized field 
of operations management, said 
Joydeep Sengupta, a second-year 
MBA student and the president of the 
Operations Management Club at 
CMUs business school. The win 
highlights the caliber of students who 
come to Carnegie Mellon, and its a 
compliment to the top-notch faculty 
who are known throughout the globe 
as being the leaders in operations 
management. CMUs operations 
management concentration is ranked 
number one by The Wall Street 
Journal and number two by US News 
& World Report.
Such case competitions are a com
mon activity at business schools 
around the world. There are a small 
number of top-tier tournaments held 
throughout the country that are the 
premier events for specific areas of 
business. For operations manage
ment, the main event is held at CMU 
and is invitation-only.
Case competitions are valuable 
learning experiences for MBA stu
dents, said Kenneth B. Dunn, CMUs 
business school dean. We are very 
proud of our team for their impres
sive performance. They faced out
standing competition, and their suc
cess confirms the exceptional quality 
of our students and our program. 
This is why recruiters value our stu
dents teamwork skills and the strong 
and immediate impact they have 
when solving complex business prob
lems. The cases normally focus-on 
various issues.

$50,000 collected 
for hospital fund
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE) 
University of Pittsburgh students 
gathered to sign paper cutouts of 
pumpkins, leaves, and turkeys to 
raise money for sick kids at the first 
annual Up Til Dawn Harvest Fest.
Up Til Dawn is a new student 
organization whose goal is to raise 
at least $50,000 for St. Jude 
Childrens Research Hospital, a hos
pital that specializes in researching 
and curing catastrophic diseases in 
children.
Were trying to get everyone on 
campus involved in one huge fund
raising effort, said Jessica Stroth, 
resident assistant and member of 
Up Til Dawn executive board.
The Harvest Fest was, in reality, a 
membership drive for Up Til Dawn. 
Stroth and the other executives 
urged passing students to sign up 
and become part of five-member 
teams.
These teams will then have all 
year to raise $500 for the organiza
tion. Some fund raisers Stroth 
planned include a Krispy Kreme 
donut sale, a car wash, and a 5K 
run.
On March 28, Up Til Dawn will v 
have its grand finale, in which all 
the teams come together and cele
brate a year of fund-raising. It will 
last 12 hours, Stroth said, from that 
night until the following Saturday.
Stroth said that in addition to 
music and dancing, children from 
St. Judes will be there to share their 
stories. Stroth plans to hold the 
grand finale in the Petersen Events 
Center.
Rare genetic study 
conducted at Pitt
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE) - 
Researchers at the University of 
Pittsburgh recently obtained human 
embryonic stem cell lines, some
thing very few universities can 
claim.
In August 2001, President Bush 
said only 78 already existing embry
onic stem cell lines would be 
approved for research with funding.
Gerald Schatten, head of the 
Pittsburgh Development Center, 
applied for the grant, and in April
2002 the grant was approved and Pitt 
received the money, said Christopher 
Navara, a cell biologist at the 
Pittsburgh Development Center and 
assistant professor of obstetrics, 
gynecology and reproductive sci
ences. In September, the University of 
California-San Francisco gave cell 
lines to the development center, 
which is part of the Magee-Womens 
Research Institute at Pitt, Navara 
said.
Only 78 cell lines are allowed for 
research because of the controversy 
surrounding human embryonic stem 
cells, according to Navara. Some con
sider an embryo a human life, and so 
cannot be morally destroyed. The 
acceptance of human embryonic stem 
cell research depends on an individ
uals definition of when actual life 
starts, Navara said.
Bushs proclamation was a compro
mise that allowed researchers to only 
use cell lines that had previously 
existed because in-vitro fertilization, 
Navara said.
In-vitro fertilization involves fertil
izing eggs outside of a womans body. 
If more embryos begin to develop 
than is necessary, the extra embryos 
are removed and are donated for 
research if the donor consents, 
Navara said. This usually occurs 
about one week after fertilization, 
when the embryo is in the form of a 
blastocyst. A blastocyst is a cluster of 
cells with an outer cell layer, called 
the trophectoderm, and a cluster of 
cells inside, called the inner cell mass.
The inner cell mass can be removed 
from the blastocyst and cultured in a 
Petri dish. In the cultured dish, the 
cells divide to grow increasing 
amounts of embryonic stem cells. All 
of these cells make up one cell line, 
she said.
According to the National Institute 
of Health, which researched the exact 
number of pre-existing cell lines, 
there are 78 cell lines. According to 
Navara, in actuality, there are only 10 
cell lines. Some of these cell lines are 
exact replicates. For example, Geron 
Corporation in California is listed as 
having seven cell lines, but five of 
these cell lines are exact replicates of 
other cell lines.
Cell lines are replicates when they 
are grown from the same blastocyst. 
Some cell lines grow so much that 
they overcrowd the Petri dish, and 
have to be divided into two dishes. 
Even though they are the same cell 
line for research purposes, NIH refers 
to them as separate cell lines, Navara 
said. This problem is compounded 
because very little is known about the 
actual structure of stem cells.

Lycos pulls CMU through 
tech transfer revolution
Women form 
Asian interest 
sorority
Brad Yankiver/Assistant Photo Editor
Karen Beadway, assistant vice president for human resources, takes her son Jacob to the Cyert Center.
Faculty/staff leave policies differ
by Tim Bowen
Staffwriter
Students alarmed by groups of 
young Asian women in uniforms of 
red sweaters and Adidas pants need 
not fear an impending mass suicide. 
Banish your visions of red Kool-Aid; 
these women are merely sisters of 
Kappa Phi Lambda, the thirteenth 
chapter of the national Asian-interest 
sorority.
Eleven sisters made the transition 
from an informal organization known 
as Bliss to the more structured Kappa 
Phi Lambda (KPL). Bliss was formed 
specifically to pursue an eventual 
shift to Greek life. The women have 
traveled all over the country to visit 
other chapters of KPL, and have had 
to make several trips to Rutgers 
University in New Jersey.
Rutgers University was our host 
school. They are the school that 
pledged us in, said Hannah Kim, 
sophomore policy and management 
major and president of KPL. The pil
grimages to Rutgers were accompa
nied by trips to several other universi
ties.
We are getting to know sisters, 
and learning from them, said Kim.
In addition to copious travel time, 
the women are apparently required to 
wear a uniform of sorts. The reasons 
for this remain a mystery. Kim classi
fied the information as a sorority 
secret.
Sophomore business major Carrie 
Yu said, It shows unity.
When pressed for further com
ment, they declined.
This group of identically-clothed 
young women is one of several new 
Asian-interest groups on campus. The 
sorority will join Lambda Phi Epsilon 
and Pi Delta Psi fraternaties as the 
third Greek Asian-interest group on 
campus, all of them formed within 
the last year.
But KPL is not just new to Carnegie 
Mellon.
On a national level, our sorority is 
still very young, said Kim. The first, 
or alpha, chapter of the organiza
tion was founded in 1995 at the Sate 
University of New York at 
Binghamton.
The group has experienced signifi
cant growth, with several new chap
ters emerging each year since 1997. 
Despite this growth, the organization 
still does not have standing with the 
Panhellenic council, the organization 
that determines codes of conduct for 
national sororities. As a result, they 
do not participate in the formal 
recruitment process.
We will be participating in recruit
ment which will most likely be infor
mal, said Kim.
The sisters have anticipated ten
sion from other Greek organizations.
We dont want to rub anyone, the 
wrong way, said Kim If there are 
any negative vibes it is because peo
ple do not understand.
The racial nature of the organiza
tion also raises concerns addressed by 
Kim, who classifies the organization 
as Asian interest.
By no means are we Asian-exclusive, she said. I think thats a big 
misunderstanding. While the eleven 
sisters of KPL at CMU are all Asian, 
non-Asian sisters exist at other chap
ters of the sorority.
The organization has plans to inte
grate themselves with the Greek com
munity at CMU by eventually partici
pating in events such as Greek Week 
and other philanthropic events.
We try to make a presence with 
events, said Kim. These unscheduled 
events will most likely take the form 
of charitable efforts, according to 
Kim.
Our sorority promotes sisterhood, 
service and cultural diversity, she 
said.
Henderson 
fix upcoming
HENDERSON, from page A1
seating, to tie together areas of differ
ent elevations and act as an outdoor 
meeting area.
When Henderson House reopens it 
will contine the Wellness Program, 
which requires residents and their 
guests to stay substance free (no alco
hol, tobacco, or illicit drugs) and to 
participate in health education pro
grams sponsored by the house.
CMU planned to renovate 
Henderson last December, but other 
areas required funding. Michael said 
he does not regret postponing it.
Were hoping that equates to good 
pricing, he said.
Many of the residents disagree.
I hate the fact that were moving, 
because we all got really close  
these people are my closest friends, 
and now theyre splitting us up. With 
all the stuff we have going on, itll be a 
real hassle, said Veronique Lee, a res
ident of Henderson and first-year HSS 
student. Also, its a nice layout  I 
dont think it needs to be renovated.
LEAVE, from page A1
years in advance to accumulate even 
one month of paid days off. If the 
individual has used both PTO and 
RSD, then the individual can take 
unpaid leave.
The faculty leave policy does not 
cover staff because it is designed to 
address the conflict that sometimes 
occurs between commitments to 
childbearing/rearing and the tenure 
decision process, said Barbara 
Smith, assistant vice president of 
human resources. In the absence of 
such a policy, faculty, particularly 
women faculty who bear children, 
may feel the need to opt between 
family and career. This policy is 
intended to address that pressure.
Essentially, the staff and faculty 
have the same temporal benefits in 
their respective leave policies, but 
differ on the issue of money.
Part of the thing that is nice 
about our leave is that a lot of that is 
negotiated with your supervisor in 
your department. So even if you 
wanted to take an extended leave 
and an unpaid leave you could prob
ably work that out. You basically 
have the opportunity to set your 
leave dates, said Jennifer Church, 
assistant dean of student affairs and 
a staff member who took leave 
under federal policy two years ago.
While the United States and 
CMUs faculty leave policies offer 
flexibility, many institutions in 
European countries adopt lengthier 
paid leave plans.
In France, they get six months 
paid leave and sometimes up to a 
year, to be sure that you would get 
your job back, said Youngs. Thats 
anywhere from a secretary to a lec
turer. Everybody has access to the
same leave. Its actually not even 
called maternity leave, its called the 
cong parentale [parental leave], so 
it could be the father who receives 
leave and/or the mother who 
receives leave.
The taxes are higher in France 
than in' the United States, but 
according to Youngs, social pro
grams, like child care, are incorpo
rated into the workforce.
Its a trade-off. They dont have 
to worry about the things we have to 
worry about. When I was having my 
babies here, maternity went under 
disability, and I just planned my 
babies for the summer, said 
Professor Youngs.
Said Church, My husband works 
in corporate America where they 
dont necessarily have this type of 
leave policy, so I think [CMUs staff 
policy] is fine and very fair. 
Graduate students also must bal
ance work with family planning. 
Erin Krupka, a first-year doctoral 
student in social and decision sci
ences, and her husband Doug are 
parents of four-month-old Nikolas. 
Erins primary consideration when 
going through the decision process 
for graduate schools was child care. 
She chose CMU because she and 
Doug found ways to balance work 
and family.
Doug takes care of Nikolas on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays while I am 
in class, said Erin. If I could not 
have found a way to balance educa
tion and family, I would have 
deferred for a year.
The Krupkas divide time between 
class and work to take care of 
Nikolas because of steep prices in 
child care for infants.
The day care center in 
Morewood [the Cyert Center] is
kind of expensive. Its high quality, 
but not cheap enough for graduate 
students to afford, said Erin.
The Cyert Center  not to be con
fused with the Childrens Center in 
Margaret Morrison Hall, a 
Psychology department preschool 
program  currently costs $1,125 a 
month for full-time care of an infant. 
Tuition at other day care centers in 
Pittsburgh typically is significantly 
lower than at the Cyert Center.
At the Western Pennsylvanian 
Hospital in Bloomfield, care costs 
$440 a month, while the Carriage 
House Childrens Center at the 
Wightman School community build
ing in Squirrel Hill charges $750 a 
month.
Not only are tuition fees expen
sive for the Cyert Center, but the 
waiting list is extremely long.
The waiting list is huge, said 
Erin. People sign up there when 
they conceive.
In his annual address to staff 
members last Wednesday, President 
Jared Cohon addressed the lack of 
child care.
He said the Cyert Center is filled 
to capacity and cannot accept more 
children.
As were able to move ahead on 
implementing our master plan, 
which calls for construction in the 
Morewood parking lot area, well try 
to use that as an opportunity to 
expand the childcare center, said 
Cohon in a later interview.
But, Cohon did not offer sugges
tions as to how the Cyert Center 
could be expanded, if at all.
Were not committed to it. Its 
very expensive.

INNOVATION, from page A1
chose to back out of its Lycos invest
ment. Fine precision would have 
netted the University millions of 
dollars in extra revenue if it timed 
the sale just before the dot-com 
crash. Poorer timing though might 
have meant that Craig Markovitz 
would still be working tech transfer 
back in Philly instead of jumpstarting CASurgica. And as Markovitz 
said, The University is not in the 
speculation game.
Changing Tech Transfer
Even though Lycos no longer car
ried the CMU stamp, the company 
set the tone for CMU tech transfer. 
CMU wanted that next Lycos.
It put us in the top 10 in terms of 
revenue, said Gabriel.
And thats what drove tech trans
fer at CMU for a long time. Choose 
wisely and spend  lavishly became 
CMU tech transfer philosophy. After 
all, it had worked for Lycos.
Then reality hit.
We wanted to fundamentally 
change our approach [after the bub
ble burst], said Gabriel. The dot
com period really was an aberra
tion.
With money from Lycos spent 
transforming Building D into 
Newell-Simon, and the dot-coms 
sliding down the tubes (including 
Lycos), tech transfer at CMU began 
to flag, requiring a subsidy from the 
University just to stay afloat.
The University Research 
Committee (URC) was asked to 
revamp both the University policies 
on tech transfer, and its overall 
innovation philosophy. The URC, 
headed by Gabriel, had its share of 
heavy-hitters, like computer science 
professor Michael Shamos, and 
Howard Wactlar, vice provost for 
computing and co-founder of the 
Software Engineering Institute.
Gabriel said the dialogue wasnt 
just limited to high-level faculty, 
though.
We went out to anybody and 
everybody who had an opinion, she 
said.
In the end, tech transfer took a 
physical step away from CMU; and 
CMU took an ideological step away 
from tech transfer. The Innovation 
Transfer Center (ITC) opened up at 
4612 Forbes Avenue, divorcing the 
operation from its beginnings in a 
very cramped Warner Hall as the 
Office of Technology Transfer.
The whole idea of the new inno
vation center is its supposed to be 
much more supportive of people 
getting something developed, said 
Wactlar. Essentially, the University 
owns all technology gained through 
the use of its resources, which 
means faculty and staff research is 
the intellectual property of the 
University. When a person 
approaches the ITC to develop their 
product, there are three options, 
said Hetrick.
* The Center will either license the 
technology back to the person who 
discovered it to develop commer
cially, opt to license the technology 
to an existing company, or release 
the technology back to the person
free of University purview. Carnegie 
Mellon holds no rights to student 
research.
Once the ITC decides to pursue a 
given project, it offers a variety of 
services. In return for varying 
amounts of equity in the new com
pany, licensees can receive anything 
from complete incubation of their 
company at the University, financial 
help in ironing out patents, or help 
in market research. Or they can just 
have a set of friendly advisors.
Recent companies at CMU have 
taken a number of paths regarding 
use of the ITC resources and the atti
tudes of the founders.
Tech Transfer today
Anthony M. DiGioia and Branislav 
Jaramaz, two CMU academics, 
started CASurgica in 1997, but have 
since given over control of the busi
ness side of the venture to 
Markovitz. The companys main 
product is the HipNav system, a 
computer aid that allows doctors to 
manipulate CT scans to prepare for 
hip replacement surgery, or to use 
the images in real time to guide the 
surgery. CASurgicas currently chilly 
residence may be deceiving. 
Markovitz says FDA approval of 
HipNav is on the way in the coming 
year, based on more than 150 clini
cal trials by Dr. DiGioia. Some pro
fessors want to try and pursue the 
business end themselves, however.
Maxine Eskenazi, co-founder of 
Carnegie Speech, tries to balance 
her company, research, and teach a 
class or two in the meantime. She 
says sometimes its an 80-plus hour 
workweek, but she says she must 
just work until she finishes. 
Eskenazis software has the capabil
ity to correct the accents of foreign 
speakers of English.
No one has the pinpointing we 
do, said Eskenazi, highlighting her 
softwares advantage over other 
packages that already exist, largely 
overseas. Carnegie Speech uses 
speech recognition algorithms to 
find the flaws in non-native speech.
Wactlar, founder of Mediasite, 
returned to academia after a brief 
stint with the commercial world. His 
company tried to commercialize 
software that indexs and distributes 
video on the web (an outgrowth of 
CMUs Informedia project), but the 
company peaked at 70 employees 
and just over one million dollars in 
business without profit.
Wactlar sold the company to 
SonicFoundry and never looked 
back.
I think its a great idea to try and 
commercialize things, said Wactlar, 
but he said he never had the special 
skills of the business domain. I 
dont regret it at all.
Of like mind is Scott Stevens, 
whose company at one point 
designed an interface to let people 
ask natural language questions of a 
doctor, a customer, Albert Einstein 
(or rather reasonable digital facsim
iles thereof). The company does not 
exist anymore commercially, but 
Stevens reminisces fondly.
It was fun.... It was a good les
son, said Stevens. This ought to be 
where I stay.
Asian interest group organizes thirty hour fast for charity
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
Brad Yankiver/Assistant Photo Editor
Fast particpants gorge themselves on Parkhurst food following their 30-hour rally for starving people around the world.
After a 30-hour fast to raise money for 
underprivilged families, the 40 or so students 
who participated were tired, not quite delu
sional, and very hungry. Food, it seems, comes 
to those that wait, in the form of a large post
fast feast.
I ate a little too much, said Nick Mah, 
senior business major, after finishing two 
plates of pasta around 11 pm Saturday night: I 
definitely feel worse now.
The fundraiser, sponsored by Asian 
American Women (AAW), raised $1700 for an 
international organization that donates to 
families in need of better health care, food and 
water, and schooling.
Alice Lin, president of AAW, said the event 
was designed so that participants not only 
raise money for their cause, but are also 
exposed to hunger firsthand.
The point of this event is' to experience 
hunger so you learn not to waste, she said.
In a week-long effort to raise money for the 
famine, participants collected change from 
students in the University Center. Many stu
dents raised money by asking friends and fam
ily to sponsor them. Ann Flanigan, a junior 
information systems major, raised $88, but 
said she was expecting more donations.
Flanigan wanted to see if she could last thir
ty hours without eating, and she did.
A good portion of the time I was sleeping, 
so I wasnt thinking about my stomach, said 
Flanigan.
Like many of the fasters, she said she had lit
tle energy on Saturday. Drinks like apple juice 
and Gatorade were provided, but some chose 
not to drink anything during the fasting peri
od.
No one became sick, just tired.
At 4 pm on Friday, participants sat down to a 
pre-feast of pasta, bread, and brownies donat
ed by Parkhurst dining services, which also 
provided food for the after-feast.
At 5 pm the fasting began, and students took
this time to make sandwiches for a local food 
bank. According to Lin, this was a productive 
way to spend time, and a good way to start the 
event, as everyone had just been well-fed.
Lin initially wanted a lock-in event to keep 
everyone together to socialize and support one 
another, but it wasnt possible.
I figured itd be easier with a group of peo
ple supporting you, and thered be no food on 
site to tempt you, but if you have exams to 
study for, of course you have to study, she 
said.
Fasters were in and out of the West Wing TV 
lounge on Friday and Saturday. Two people 
spent the night and stayed up watching 
Siovies.
Lin said she encouraged people to spend 
time together.
People occupied their time by playing board 
games, watching movies, and attempting to 
study. 
Michael Chang, a senior information sys
tems major, said it was difficult to focus and 
even harder to be creative, so most of his
homework was left for Sunday. He said he did 
not mind.
You see the cause a lot more, he said. 
Were actually, for once, simulating what its 
like to be in their shoes.
Grace Wang, sophomore business major, 
said the experience opened her eyes a little 
more to what other less fortunate people have 
to go through.
We only did this for thirty hours and were 
all starving, she said, but for people that cant 
eat longer than that, its a lot harder.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 11, 2002
Steenhuis/Namey disagree 
on freedom of informationCMU architecture students battle stress
by Tim Bowen
Staffwriter
Quinten Steenhuis, chair of the 
internal development committee for 
Student Senate, wants line items of 
student organizations made freely 
available through his committees 
propsed Freedom of Infomation 
Act.
Student Body President Brian 
Namey believes that the piece still 
needs to be scrutinized before it 
becomes policy.
At this point in the process we 
are not ready to release line items, 
he said. It is my hope that there will 
be a broader student discussion.
Depending on the Senates delib
erations next week, students may be 
able to track their $65 student activ
ities fee to wherever it extends. 
Currently, only the vice president of 
finance has the power to audit stu
dent organizations.
A draft of a freedom of informa
tion policy could be modified and 
possibly ratified in the coming 
weeks.
The policy would make the bud
gets of organizations funded by the 
student activities fee public infor
mation available upon request. Not 
all expenditures would be included, 
however.
Specifically, the purchases related 
to booth and buggy events will not 
be disclosed, due to the value of 
information in remaining competi
tive in those events.
Greek organizations need not be 
concerned about releasing the 
entirety of their budget, which only 
receives around $400 from the stu
dent activities fee for booth and 
buggy expenditures.
[Greeks] wont have to reveal 
their whole budget. They will have 
to disclose that they got $400, said 
Steenhuis.
It is difficult to gauge if and when 
this policy would go into effect. 
Steenhuis remains confident to the 
amenability of the draft.
I would be really surprised if 
anyone who sat down and read the 
policy and fully understood it had 
any serious objections, he said.
Namey, however, casts doubt on 
the popularity of the policy. He has 
not declared his stance on the legis
lation, which he has the power to 
veto.
Not a single student has contact
ed me in favor of the policy, said 
Namey.
He also said student organiza
tions he had talked with, such as
Greeks, had showed reluctance 
towards releasing line item budgets. 
Student organizations which pro
vide paid services for other student 
organizations, such as AB Tech, 
would be provided with a significant 
financial advantage if the budgets 
were released.
Theoretically, AB Tech could 
research the amount of money bud
geted to pay for their services and 
then charge that full amount, 
regardless of the cost of the endeav
or.
Conversely, student organizations 
would be able to compare the rev
enue from student organizations to 
the cost of operation and call AB 
Tech on any potential price gouging.
From students on campus, espe
cially non-affiliated students, there 
has been huge support, said 
Steenhuis.
The debate over the release of the 
2002-03 organization budgets 
started last year when all line item 
budgets were posted on the Senate 
website briefly after the Joint 
Funding Committee finished in 
April.
At the time, Namey told The 
Tartan that Senate had an undocu
mented precedent of at least three 
years not to release line items to the 
student body. However, Steenhuis 
released the full budgets for 
2002-2003 anyway.
When asked about the release of 
information, Steenhuis wrote in an 
email, Were interested in having 
an open government. In some ways 
it may be a departure, yes, but its 
something that were committed 
to.
He went on to say that, the bud
gets have always been available 
upon request.
Now, the Steenhuis-generated act 
would clarify the argument that 
occurred last spring. There was 
some controversy last year when 
they were released accidentally.
Steenhuis hopes that a concrete 
policy governing this information 
will guarantee students access to the 
data and promote understanding of 
the funding process and the finan
cial needs of various student organi
zations.
Its better for everybody when 
they understand, when there is 
transparency, he said.
The policy would also put the 
financial decisions of student gov
ernment officials in the limelight.
I think the net result will be stu
dents having more accountability 
over their government officials, 
said Steenhuis.
ARCHITECTURE, from page A1
In a positive way theres no time 
for procrastination in architecture 
but we procrastinate in other sub
jects, said Nina Barbuto, a first-year 
architect. You just cant slack off 
here. You can with writing papers but 
its different with a project. Things 
take time to put together; glue has to 
dry. Sometimes we get desperate and 
use blow dryers.
According to Laura Lee, the archi
tecture coordinator for first-years, 
the major is historically rigorous. She 
said the program ranks highly and is 
the most demanding professional 
education.
The five-year program is a combi
nation of art and science, qualitative 
and quantitative, calculus and 
abstract art, said Lee. Therefore, it 
is required that students work hard to 
infuse and adjust to this wide range 
of extremes.
Architecture represents the inverse 
of most University curriculums, with 
the most demanding work falling in 
the first three years.
Our attrition rate is 10-12 percent 
after the first-year. So far we havent 
lost one of the 74 freshmen, said 
Lee. This particular group is hard
working and is generating good 
results across the board.
Attrition rates for the University 
average out at about seven percent. 
Third year is the most difficult
First-year architect Lindsey Wall prepares
because theres a lot more engineer
ing and calculus involved, said HsinI Lin, a third-year architect. Course 
site engineering is particularly hard 
because were no longer building a 
single model but an entire landscape. 
We have to learn to look at the big 
picture.
They throw a lot of questions and
her landscape of Schenley park.
theyre really picky about things we 
dont normally look at, said Lin. 
They can go on and on about one lit
tle thing. For this one assignment 
they were really critical about how 
we drew the trees and leaves incor
rectly.
Most students say that the curricu
lum relaxes over the last two years
and students learn to adjust to thearchitecture lifestyle. According to. 
John Herrington, a fourth-year archi; 
tect, the biggest difference lies in the 
self-direction of fourth and fifthyears. Students have project goals 
they work towards and thus have 
more freedom. Herrington normally 
goes to bed at 2 am.
Protestors say circus is fun for children, not animals
CIRCUS, from page A1 
backs.
William Rivas-Rivas, coordinator 
of PETAs Hispanic Community 
Outreach Campaign, is taking the 
truck on a nationwide tour, hoping to 
open peoples eyes to what he calls 
the last existing form of slavery.
People go to the circus because 
they want to see the animals, but 
they have no idea that circuses are a 
living hell for the animals, says 
Rivas-Rivas. What were doing here 
is bringing the video to the people, 
showing images of the animals being 
beaten, in an effort to get people to 
see that if theyre going to the circus, 
they are supporting animal abuse.
Despite low attendance numbers at 
protests in the Pittsburgh area, Anne 
Lynch, president of Animal 
Advocates, feels that the protests 
have been effective.
Ive noticed over the past couple 
years that Ive been doing this, 
crowds at circuses have been declin
ing, and Id like to think we have had 
something to do with that, she said.
Every year we have a number of peo
ple who will actually listen to us and 
say theyre never coming back.
Many attending the circus, howev
er, especially those with children, felt 
that the protestors should take a dif
ferent approach.
They have a right to be here, but I 
dont think its appropriate.... I think 
that if they have valid points, they 
need to take it up with the circus and 
leave the little kids alone, said circus-goer Vincent Benincasa.
Karen Kennedy, there with her two 
children aged seven and 11, said she 
had read an article in the newspaper 
about the alleged abuse of the ani
mals, but was skeptical.
From all I know, the animals are 
well-treated, she said.
Ringling Brothers and Barnum & 
Bailey Circus could not be reached 
for official comment. Their website 
vigorously denies allegations of ani
mal abuse. It lists precautions taken 
for the physical and emotional health 
of their animal performers and the 
care taken to live up to the USDAimposed Animal Welfare Act. Animal
Few activists showed up, but those who did brought the greatest signs on earth/!1
Advocates and Voices for Animal 
Liberation, which include several 
Carnegie Mellon and University of 
Pittsburgh students, held protests 
outside of the circus from Wednesday
through Sunday night. ,
Were asking people to do some
thing very simple  nothing  to. 
simply stay home, and not go to thecircus, said Rivas-Rivas.

Straightening out all the misconceptions, the correct answer is b. its a concept we should all understand and remember, and here's 
why. Depression strikes millions of young adults, but only 1 out of 5 ever seeks treatment for it. Too many just drag themselves along 
or eventually seek relief through suicide. Why not treatment? Partly lack of awareness. Partly
the unwarranted negative stigma. This is what needs fixing. This is where we need you to UNTREATED
change your attitudes. Its an illness, not a weakness. And it's readily treatable. V V

Customers deserve easy 
access to CMUs financials
^Serving as advocates for the free flow of 
information at Carnegie Mellon, representa
tives from the Progressive Student Alliance 
(PSA) met with William Elliott, vice president 
of enrollment, last Thursday to present their 
cse for an open University budget. Armed 
wffh a written proposal outlining their open 
tflv books campaign and a student petition 
v\ffth approximately 300 signatures, PSA 
hoped to glean answers about what has previ
ously been a hazy area in University policy. 
Although the group met little resistance to the 
claim that students have the right to see how 
their tuition money is spent, they unfortunate
ly did not receive a concrete timeline for the 
consideration of their proposal.
According to PSA member Quinten 
Steenhuis, Elliott expressed two major con
cerns about opening the books at CMU. First, 
he claimed that publicizing the budget could 
be a logistically difficult task. PSA is request
ing that the entire budget be made available 
both online and in hard copy format at Hunt 
Library. While the publication of the budget 
may take some time and effort on the part of 
University officials, surely it would be more 
efficient in the long run than the currently 
arduous system of providing budget informa
tion to students upon individual request. If 
Elliott truly believes that publicizing the bud
get is beyond the practical capabilities of his 
staff, he could undoubtedly find a number of 
talented students willing to'help write the 
open budget policy and build the proposed 
budget website.
Elliott also argued that opening the books 
could jeopardize the privacy of University 
employees. Specifically, he claimed that at a 
small university with a relatively low number 
of employees, it would be easy to determine
Republicans romped to a surprise nation
wide victory last Tuesday, but in Pennsylvania 
ifWas business as usual. Each of the 19 incum
bent candidates for the US House of 
Representatives won. In Allegheny Countys 
27 races for the state Congress, 11 candidates 
ran unopposed and the margin of victory 
never dipped below 12 percent, according to 
th& Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist Brian 
ONeill.
Just under 40 percent of eligible 
Pennsylvanians turned out to vote in the 
states lackluster races. An estimate by a 
University of Maryland research group found 
that only 14 percent of 18-24 year olds in 
Pennsylvania voted.
Some argue that the increasingly money-dri-' 
ven nature of politics excludes young voters 
because of their inability to make big campaign 
donations. As Michael Wein, a 27-year-old can
didate for the Maryland House of Delegates 
pointed out, There are not too many million
aire 18-to-24-year-olds out there. But politi
cians overlooking the youth constituency are 
only part of the problem. Barriers to voting are 
overlooked and underestimated.
.Absentee balloting works for the interested, 
albeit temporarily distant voter. But how many 
students from outside Pittsburgh are informed 
enough to pass judgment on candidates back 
home that may not even represent them upon 
graduation? In Pennsylvania, a person only 
needs to be a resident of an election district for 
30 days to be eligible to vote. College students 
could become a powerful voting block in local 
elections if they made Pittsburgh their legal 
place of residence. At the 30,000-student Penn 
State University in State College, a paltry
8,000 are registered to vote, and according to 
the Daily Collegian, the Democratic Party 
expected only 1,000 of them to cast ballots 
during last Tuesdays election. Imagine the 
influence Penn State students could have in

the budgeted salaries of specific administra
tors and professors. Questions of privacy could 
be addressed easily by stipulating that the 
published budget include only overall depart
mental salaries. PSA understands Elliotts pri
vacy concerns, and says that they are only 
interested in summary information about 
employee salaries  not personally identify
ing details.
It was evident to PSA members during the 
meeting that the administration does not ulti
mately oppose the publication of the 
University budget, said group representative 
Stuart Anderson. Elliott reportedly rebuffed 
attempts by PSA members to explain the 
underlying reasons for their request, prefer
ring instead to focus on the specific informa
tion to be published and the logistics behind 
the proposal. Such a stance indicates a willing
ness to move quickly and assertively towards 
an open budget. However, plans for University 
action appear vague. According to Anderson, 
Elliott will meet with President Jared Cohon to 
discuss the proposal sometime after this 
Thursday.
Student Government is presently consider
ing legislation to publicize their own budget, 
thus revealing how students activities fees are 
spent each year. Both Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) will vote 
on this commendable proposal within the next 
four weeks. The University should follow suit 
and create a definite plan for publicizing its 
budget by the end of the semester. Students 
have waited long enough to learn how the 
University allocates tuition money. Thanks to 
the assertive members of PSA, they may soon 
have that opportunity, but only if University 
administrators give the proposal the immedi
ate time and attention that it deserves.
local politics like the mayors race if 15,000 
students showed up at the polls in the 38,000- 
person city. Likewise, what kind of power 
could 7,000 Carnegie Mellon students wield in 
the race for city council or mayor?
If the youth of this country are as uncon
cerned with politics as every study seems to 
indicate, politicians should examine every 
alternative to the current bureaucratic elec
tion system. Although Californians failed this 
past Tuesday to pass a referendum 
(Proposition 52) that would have allowed citi
zens to register and vote on election day, six 
states currently have same-day-registration 
policies. In those states, voter turnout is signif
icantly higher than the national average, 
according to a study commissioned by Prop 52 
supporters and conducted at MIT and Cal 
Tech. In the 2000 presidential race, the nation
al voter turnout average was below 50 percent. 
But in states with same-day registration, twothirds of eligible voters turned out at the polls. 
Same-day registration is largely credited with 
rallying the electorate that propelled third 
party candidate Jesse Ventura to victory in 
Minnesota in 1998.
Detractors worry that same-day voter regis
tration opens the system up to fraudulent ballots 
and an unwelcome electorate  the kind that 
gives third parties a chance. However, no evi
dence indicates that voter fraud has increased in 
the six same-day-registration states.
The highest ideal the country can work 
toward is a popular democracy. If there are 
ways to achieve fair and accurate representa
tion, then we must continually work to lower 
the barriers to voting. A university like 
Carnegie Mellon is an institution especially 
well-suited to work toward venerable political 
goals like easier access to voting. If the govern
ment can commit millions to cybersecurity 
research, why not also explore ways to make 
online voting a reality?

Dont print names in 
Crime & Incident
Editor,
I was absolutely shocked and dismayed 
when I read the Crime & Incident report last 
week and saw the names of three students 
who were cited for marijuana possession. To 
print the names of students being cited is an 
example of massive journalistic irresponsi
bility. There is absolutely no reason that 
these students should have their dirty laun
dry aired in front of the entire campus com
munity, including their professors, staff, and 
fellow students.
Unless your newspaper is willing to 
change its name to the Carnegie Mellon 
Enquirer, you must return to your previous 
policy of preserving anonymity in the Crime 
& Incident report. Reference to anonymous 
actors preserves the news value in the 
Crime & Incident report while protecting 
the privacy of students. This is a step that 
you must take in order to preserve the 
integrity and journalistic ethics that we 
should expect from your publication and to 
assure your place as a constructive member 
of our community.

Editor poses threat to 
journalistic integrity
Editor,
We, the Executive Board of the KGB, were 
enraged to read the article in The Tartan 
regarding the student periodical readme. We 
publish a newsletter for our organization, 
called Pravda?, and as such, were absolutely 
disgusted at your treatment of the readme 
staff and their editorial process. A member 
of your staff obtained an unreleased copy of 
readme under extremely questionable cir
cumstances and then, rather than withhold
ing the article (as journalistic integrity 
would have dictated), you printed that sen
sational diatribe regarding the readme 
staffs supposed racism in a base attack 
against their morals, ancestry, and dietary 
habits.
Your writer created an issue where none 
existed, an action which casts serious 
doubts on any claim that The Tartan is an 
objective, reliable source of news.
However, that is not even our primary 
concern. In truth, we fear that your article 
was a harbinger of what will become a cam
paign of terror and jelly against not only the 
delightful, weekly six pages of joy that is 
readme, but also against the whole institu
tion of student-run publications that form 
the spine of American freedom.
We are writing to let you know that we 
have recognized the threat you pose, Brad 
Grantz, and that we will not stand for it. You 
may be able to overwhelm any single publi
cation with the weight of your staff and 
budget, but united with a common goal, 
we form a fighting force of extraordinary 
magnitude.
Know this now, Brad Grantz of The 
Tartan: We are on to your game and we are 
taking action. The publications of this cam
pus will be forming Voltron, and readme will 
be the black lion!

Parkhurst story an 
imbalanced account 
Editor,
I am a graduate student here at CMU, but 
come from a journalism background. I 
picked up the October 28 issue of The 
Tartan and was appalled by the article, 
Union says Parkhurst silences its employ
ees, not because it was supporting the 
union workers, but because it seemed to 
give a sensationally imbalanced account of 
events.
It is every publications ethical decision to 
include name-calling whether they deem it 
necessary to truly represent peoples 
accountand although I dont have a solid 
opinion of its use, I feel that this was a case 
where it damaged the objectivity of the 
paper.
By including the quotes No one wants to 
fuck around with them. Theyre evil and 
Jane Fahringer? Shes a big bitch, is what it 
comes down to. Everybody hates her, Jane 
Fahringer is never given a chance to 
respond. Even if she had commented on the 
accusations against her, with such scathing 
remarks placed not only so close to one 
another but so close to the lede, the reader 
would have already formed an opinion 
about her. Not to mention that Deighans 
last comment  Everybody hates her  is 
conjecture and speculation.
Sure, there are probably some, maybe a 
lot, of people who despise this woman, but 
its not his place to speak for them. The 
author does acknowledge trying to contact 
both Fahringer and Rostek, but are there 
other managers? Are they all this bad? Why 
werent they questioned?
I already have commented on this to some 
extent, but I have to come back to it  Zack 
Deighan makes merciless comments about 
Fahringer.
Granted, the point of including his com
ments is valid since he is/was an employee, 
but it seems as though he is the material 
source against this woman. It also seems 
that the photo of him giving the finger to 
Parkhurst only further hurt his credibility as 
a reliable source of information  it makes 
him appear as some pissed-off kid or worker 
who has a score to settle. Again, Im brought 
back to the objectivity issue  the authors 
opinion is so obvious that it jeopardizes the 
integrity/credibility of the information pre
sented. Who am I supposed to trust? The 
guy flipping me off in the photo on the next 
page?
Anyway, as I said before, I support the 
union workers complaints about manage
ment, but I am concerned that the 
ethical/editorial decisions made, at least in 
my opinion, did a disservice to the employ
ees by making them seem like petty namecallers and tattletails.

In defense of Defense: 
CMU serves the US
Dear Editor,
This is in response to the coverage on 
Department of Defense (DoD) research at 
CMU. The entire coverage revealed an edito
rial slant of skepticism bordering on disap
proval of the research conducted through 
CMU and specifically the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI). Such research 
actually, although you could not tell just by 
reading the articles, provides untold bene
fits to the University (and thus the student 
body), the military, and all Americans. Also, 
conducting such research does not necessar
ily compromise any of the Universitys 
ideals.
First, let us discuss the benefits. In accept
ing such research, the school receives, on 
average, around $70 million per annum, 
money which can be used for any number of 
improvements to campus. Unlike public uni
versities that get government money as a 
part of their charter, private universities like 
CMU often have to take on outside research 
to finance operations. $70 million a year can 
be directly applied to, or will allow for, pro
jects such as the new lab facilities in Doherty 
or the hiring of new professors, changes 
which ultimately benefit the University and 
its students.
Second, the nature of research specifical
ly mentioned was an examination of 
unmanned combat vehicle technology. By
placing our troops safe out of harms way 
when conducting operations, this technolo
gy helps to save American lives. Any number 
of our relatives, friends, and neighbors serve 
our nation proudly in the Armed Forces, and 
developments in defense technology make 
their job easier and safer.
And what is this job? This job is the pro
tection of you, me, and all Americans. 
Nowhere in this article, or in the accompa
nying editorial (though sometimes you 
could not tell the difference), is the vital 
function of this research mentioned. Right 
now, more than ever, we as a nation need to. 
be protected. SEI research into Internet 
security, for example, makes it easier for us 
to protect ourselves from cyber-terrorism, a 
phenomenon that defense experts warn will 
be more widespread and dangerous in the 
coming years.
As the University seeks to accept research 
contracts, it is important to see if these con
tracts do not shortchange the educational 
process. In accepting DoD contracts, not 
only does the University gain funding and 
valuable hands-on research experience, it 
assists in the protection of our citizenry and 
our freedoms. No higher goal is possible, as 
long as the University can keep its role as an 
impartial evaluator and educator.

No respect given to 
pro-Palstinian views c
Dear Editor, t
It is with great displeasure and sadnessi 
that I inform you of my unwavering support 
for Nasser Abukhdeirs article, since it accu
rately and explicitly addresses the problem 
of the other side of anti-Semitism on our 
campus: discrimination against our Arab 
community and disrespect for their con* 
cerns and beliefs.
Lets face it. Palestine IS in the heart of 
every Arab, and has found its way into the 
modern Arab consciousness. To expect them 
to keep silent about such a collective tragedy 
is pointless. They will always talk about ity 
and they deserve as much respect as any 
other legitimate ethno/socio/political fac
tion. 1
Yet, the tragedy is that in our campus 
community there is no such thing as defer
ence for them.
I have been a spectator to multiple acts of 
hate-inspired vandalism and bigotry against 
Palestinians and Arabs in general. From sab
otaging the solemn events of the National 
Palestine Week last semester, presenting 
racist videos in front of the UC portraying 
Palestinian children as future terrorists and 
posting flyers in campus which demonized 
Palestinian society, the pro-Israel faction on 
our campus has shown no shame or the 
slightest respect for the viewpoints of the 
Arabs in regards to such a humanitarian and 
political catastrophe.
Some even go as far as hijacking historical 
tragedies such as the Holocaust as justifica
tion for their lack of tolerance towards the 
views of others. Their favorite weapon to 
silence deviant opinions is the antiSemitic label, which society regards with 
great trepidation.
It seems to me that the mantra dominat
ing the political consciousness of this cam
pus is the denial of a larger reality. Some 
regard the discussion of Israels policies 
towards Palestine as the elephant in the liv
ing room, turning a blind eye in fear of 
being branded anti-Semitic. Others deny 
respect to those who look across the Green 
Line to the east of the Israeli heartland and 
ask: What about them?
How can there be dialogue and democra
cy in an environment that lacks respect? If 
this University is breeding any of our future 
political leaders, then I feel extremely sorry 
for what our world might become.

The Markets Pittfall: SEC 
needs a confident leader
Christian M. Restifq
When, not if, was the big question last week regarding the resignation of 
former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Harvey L. 
Pitt. Following the tradition of bowing out only after a midterm election, 
Pitt resigned late Tuesday night after the flap over his selection of William 
Webster as head of a new board that will oversee the accounting industry. 
Pitts handling of the issue shows just how much the Bush administration 
needs to carefully  and quickly  select the new head of the SEC.
^ First, lets be brutally honest. President George W. Bushs selection of Pitt 
to head the SEC constituted what will undoubtedly be viewed as one of 
Bushs biggest mistakes. Hed represented all the accounting firms as a pri
vate practice lawyer, raising the question of whether or not the fox would 
be watching the chicken coop. When the accounting scandals came to light 
last year, Pitt already had a big conflict of interest on his hands.
Pitts handling of member selection for the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (PCAOB) simply capped 15 months of lethargic moves to 
improve the transparency of the financial markets. Created by Congress as 
a response to recent scandals, the PCAOB will oversee accounting firms. 
Ideally, the PCAOB would have the ability to inspect accounting practices, 
punish wrongdoers, and set new standards.
Such a board would improve faith in the financial markets. But consider 
its makeup: out of the five current members, only one has any public 
record regarding accounting. By failing to give the board strong, indepen
dent members Pitt and the SEC commissioners have laid the ground for 
successful lobbying by the remaining four accounting firms.
The worst part, though, was Pitts selection of Webster to head the 
PCAOB. Webster used to head the audit committee for US Technologies, an 
Internet incubator now facing shareholder lawsuits. The former CEO is 
also facing a criminal investigation for fraud. After Webster notified Pitt of 
the US Technologies issue, Pitt failed to disclose this information to SEC 
commissioners.
This is not to say that Webster would make a poor chairman. He did the 
right thing by disclosing this potential conflict to Pitt, who then failed to 
pass it on. Pitt, however, erred at the very beginning by selecting Webster 
over John Biggs, the former chairman and CEO of TIAA-CREF, after the 
accounting industry made a ruckus over Biggs.
Such a decision essentially killed the PCAOB from the beginning. For 
those who arent familiar with it, TIAA-CREF is one of the largest pension 
and annuity companies in the nation. The vast majority of universities, 
including Carnegie Mellon, use TIAA-CREF for their retirement plans. 
TLAA-CREF has a hard won reputation as a low-cost retirement plan 
provider that looks out for the interests of shareholders.
The selection of Biggs would have sent an important signal to the mar
kets, namely that shareholder concerns will drive the behavior of the 
PCAOB. After all, thats what this whole episode is about. Without accurate 
and representative financial information, investors cannot make the best 
decisions. Shareholders only lend credence to financial reports and audit
ing results when they feel theres no Enron-style chicanery.
- Its now up to the Bush administration to pick a new SEC chairman, 
though current word on the street is that such a selection may take up to a 
few months. People are floating several names including former New York 
City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Mike Chertoff, the Assistant Attorney 
General who prosecuted Arthur Andersen.
Bush needs to act and do so quickly. The federal government has already 
lost momentum to states like New York where state Attorney General Eliot

Okay, forget the economy. Forget the fact that Mike 
Bloombergs absurd tax on cigarettes ($7.50 for a pack, at 
last count) has only deepened New Yorks recession and 
encouraged people to smuggle cigarettes in from out-ofstate and Long Island's Native American reservations. 
Forget the study conducted by the Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory that concluded that secondhand smoke 
inhaled by diners and workers in New Yorks restaurants 
and bars is far below Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration limits. Forget, if you can, 57% of 
California's restaurants losing business after the smoking 
ban went into effect there (www.pmoptions.com). Forget
all about this, Bloomberg and you who count yourselves 
among his proud anti-smoking minions; disregard the 
facts, you righteous, pious, roll-your-eyes-when-I-get-ona-bus-smelling-like-cigarettes activists (youve never paid 
any attention to the facts before....) and just consider, for 
a moment, what city youre talking about.
Let me help you. This is New York City. The city of 
grime, sweat, and dust. The city of $400 Jimmy Choo

you get the picture?

a college can learn much about the color of your

Because really, what do location or skin color

Colleges should certainly look at racial per
centages and country of origin. Skin and geo
graphical diversity b a flawed but generally 
accurate measure of cultural climate at 
Carnegie Mellon or any big corporation. 
Warning bells should go off if IBM was com
prised entirely of white Texans. But lets use it 
as simply that  a way to frelp evaluate an 
organization. Dont ask students for their 
nationality or ethnicity while deciding the fate 
of their higher education.
If CMU were really interested in diversity, it 
would stop asking, see what happened after a 
blind admissions process, and reevaluate their 
admissions process thereafter. I bet without 
skin color as a marker, Vice President of 
Enrollment Bill Elliott and company dont know 
India from Indiana.
King demonstrated through his method of 
non-violent protest, and in his Letter from a 
Birmingham Jail, that it was wrong to use
immoral means to achieve moral ends. But it 
may not even be the moral ends current diversi
ty policies are after.
Look around you. Know any poor kids?
Its big business meets cultural sensitivity; its 
manufacturing diversity; its an assembly line of 
skin color with us as the components. In 
essence, its the easiest (and cheapest) way for 
companies, television, and colleges to avoid 
really having to treat people fairly. At Carnegie 
Mellon, we have a deceptive visual variety. I 
know. I have a lot of Indian friends here who are 
more like me than they are their parents. And 
most of the black kids I met here dont sling the 
same Ebonics that most of the black kids did at 
my high school in Houston. Some of those kids 
from my hometown arent here because they 
cant hack it, but some arent here because they 
cant afford it.
Instead of educating kids, instead of replac
ing racist human resources workers, instead of 
addressing monetary concerns, our society has 
accepted a color standard. Our diversity poli
cies give rise to people who grow up not know
ing a thing about basic human respect, but they 
know its not ok to say nigger. They dont even 
know why, except they will get into trouble. 
And its not just kids, either.
We mix color and money. CMUs very reputa
tion is partially based on a racial quota they can 
and do manufacture. It saves money in evaluat
ing people when you do it by race. And then 
they attract students by plastering the most 
diverse group of faces on the admissions liter
ature. Its even

People need to take a look at society when 
percentages start to drive who belongs to what 
organization. We see it at colleges, in compa
nies, and on television. We expect to see a black 
man in every commercial. We expect to see the 
most colorful bunch possible, especially on tele
vision, where image is everything. We expect a 
yellow man, a brown man, and some white 
folks.
At what point did people get tricked into 
believing that skin color is equal to culture; that 
variety of skin color is equal to diversity? We 
might argue that forcing color diversity in tele
vision reinforces the idea that anybody can 
reach the level of doctor or lawyer (i.e. higher 
economic status). But we must face the possi
bility that we only cover the problem with opti
mistic images for the masses.
In 1968, a bullet killed a great man, ending a 
career that did much to give actual rights to a 
people who had few. In 2002, our flawed con
cept of diversity threatens to destroy the ideas 
Martin Luther King Jr. died for.
Culture does not equal a percentage. Culture 
is not a color. Culture is not even the clothes we 
wear or the food we eat. Imagine if a college 
couldnt judge skin color but they knew what 
you ate. They could easily enough determine 
where you are likely from; at the very least,
die class minorities, because they dont have to 
give them as much financial aid. Do you think 
CMU wants black students at $8,000 or 
$30,000 a pop?
Lets spend a couple of bucks and a few extra 
minutes and set aside the telescope, because we 
think we see the big picture but we dont know 
when were looking the wrong way. Get in there 
with a microscope and really measure whats 
going on with your fellows if you are an every
day Joe, or in your applicant pool if you are a 
college or university.
Such an approach  judging the individual 
 would not only make CMU a stronger school, 
it would make the world a better place. Cliched 
perhaps, but heres why: well never teach any
thing but grudging tolerance to the world with 
our current perspective. Our children shouldnt 
even see skin color, except for what it is.
I make a lot of accusations against our diver
sity policy. I argue it hides socioeconomic 
issues. I argue it offers superficial reassurance. 
I argue that its racist, even. I argue that we 
tread a path so crooked the destination could 
not possibly be what we intend. But answer 
only this.
Do you want to be a percentage, an ethnicity 
checkbox, or a bona fide person?
I for one agree with the good doctor.

More importantly, Bush needs to 
push this issue to the top of his agen

Last column I made certain accusations. I 
produced certain conclusions. I pointed the 
finger of blame at those persons of interest 
and demanded explanation. But what if I had
nt? What would have been the harm, really? A 
few platitudinal instructors inject their own 
personal opinions into the course material, no 
matter how bilious. Independent student voic
es are either ignored by a coercive majoritarianism or attacked outright for their insensitiv
ity and reluctance to conform. The war of we 
versus me continues unabated, untram
meled, and unchallenged. Individual liberty 
and self-definition are thrown into the dump
ster, and an apathetic student body swallows 
any pabulum administrators and the professo
rate mandate they should be force-fed this 
week or semester or year. Like a veal calfs del
icately sheltered life, students are so larded 
with misinformation and illiberal considera
tions that their clouded brains consider the 
release granted by the butchers block to be 
sweet bliss, a token end to a half-lived life. 
What would be the harm, indeed.
I dont know about you, but my patience 
with constantly having to suffer under imperi
ous instructors has worn thin and is about to 
fray. Any amount of apathy or cheerful insou
ciance from this point on is no better than a 
rubber stamp for professors  at CMU and 
elsewhere  to twist us like pretzels around 
their own agenda. Your indifference to the

Who are these anti-smoking 
activists, so strong and sure in their

New York City's establishments? Who 
; tQwns these restaurants, bars and 
Qclubs? The fresh, still-wet-behind-his,,ajs (although arguably well-inten>(tioned) mayor and his beaurocratic 
j^awns or the thousands of hard
working proprietors that have always 
'had the right to choose whether or 
not their establishments accomodate 
smokers? The proposed smoking ban 
is a proposterous insult to all that is 
sacred to New York past, present and 
' future, but all lofty and ethereal prin
ciples aside (for only a moment, mind 
you), its an explicit violation of con
stitutional rights.
New York promises a lot to its citi
zens, and for the most part, it deliv
ers. It promises diversity, it promises 
art and entertainment and industry 
and opportunity and a deluxe veggieburger with bacon on top. New York 
promises discussion, debate, and, at 
times, disaster. It promises romance, 
humor, and, if youre lucky, some real 
friends. But at no point in New Yorks 
history were you promised that you 
, Would be safe. You can barely walk 
through the park without having 
your wits sharpened by a mugger or a 
harmless lunatic. You can hardly take 
two steps without tripping on a crack 
in the street or catching mystery mist 
in your mouth as it emits from some 
elusive vent. Food poisoning? You bet 
 its called a hot dog with relish.
Fasten your seatbelt, because youre 
in a cab. The point is, its a dangerous 
city  it is the epitome of the fast 
lane, and we like it like that. So 
where on earth did you come up with 
the idea that something as relatively 
harmless (according to the Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory) as secondhand 
smoke should be banned in this city?
Aside from the disastrous effect 
that this ban (and past restrictions, 
including the obscene tax on ciga
rettes) will have on the business of 
bars, restaurants, clubs, and cigarette 
vendors, aside from the fact that 
there is absolutely no reliable scien
tific evidence to suggest that banning 
smoking will significantly decrease 
health risks, is the fact that if 
Bloomberg wants to get reelected 
badly enough to start banning things, 
he should think about banning some 
of the elements in New York that real
ly are hazardous to peoples health. 
Like hot dogs. Or manic-depressive 
cab drivers. Or syringes coated with 
crack cocaine in the childrens play
ground on 63rd and 1st. How about 
rape, cholesterol, foul balls that

add)? But cigarettes? Cigarettes?! 
Please. New York is an oasis of free
will, autonomy, and spirit in our everhomogenized, overly-PCd country. 
Its hard enough to maintain this 
citys soul without our own mayor 
aiming to sabotage one of its great

Its not just tobacco, it's not just

threat is your own pliability, to be exploited 
any time you enter a lecture or proffer a 
thought in recitation. The assault on individual 
thought and liberty is legion, the number of 
incidents rushing in with numbing predictabil
ity from the major news outlets and Internet 
web blogs.
A student shouted down at some tweedy Ivy 
for assuming a whiff of individuality; a petition 
circulated by two Berkeley professors calling 
on their students to protest the war in Iraq, 
Israels strikes against Palestinians, and the 
Bush tax cut; law students at Dartmouth 
College, after alleging the slightest bit of calci
fied thought amongst the local professor rack
et, are quickly served with a letter to the editor 
at the Law Review, hinting not-too-subtly at 
academic repercussions or expulsions unless 
their fair-minded analysis was sacked. In every 
instance, the culprit(s) represented a view
point not in keeping with the institutional line.
By assuming in loco parentis status and the 
perquisites that go along with academic free
dom universities are doing a disservice to free 
discussion and self-liberty by curtailing a num
ber of student rights  with regularity, I might 
add  in the name of protecting the student. 
Essentially, professors are more and more plac
ing a premium on what students feel, not what 
they know. This way, any attempt at individu
ality or free expression first needs to pass a lit
mus test of what impact it may have on the 
spirits of other students, seriously damaging 
any attempt at free discussion. Unsure of how 
our views may affect (offend?) a class, we 
instead clam up about convictions, beliefs, and 
the like and become like the Neutrals of 
Dantes Inferno, ever-more plagued by the 
stances, however unpopular, we never chose to 
accept in life. As with the two big political par
ties, youthful apathy is welcome  bankable 
even  for national universities and liberal 
arts colleges that seek to impose their own cul
ture of conformity on student voices.
When I confronted professor Linda Flower 
about the petition she had circulated over the
English Department distribu
tion list, I received a convinc
ing mea culpa. Okay, theres 
no sense railing against an 
honest mistake. I cant say the 
contretemps had impaired 
her ability to defend the 
actions of professors at simi
lar universities, though. Each 
time I stressed the point of an 
open environment for free 
expression, I was met with a 
half-agreement followed by a 
stream of Orwellian teachspeak so thick in deliberative 
models and discursive phi
losophy that the original 
nugget of importance was 
buried in rhetorical rubble.
Why should any student feel 
compelled to sign a docu
ment that may or may not 
interest them? And why 
when confronted with oppo
sition to a singularity of opinion-makers do administra
tions  and here I posit 
Flowers remarks as a kind of 
crude microcosm  turn 
into obscurantists and lingual 
rope-a-dope artists. (This 
phenomenon is reproduced 
with alarming frequency to such ends as cam
pus speech codes, campus community dia
logue sessions and sensitivity training semi
nars, all mandatory of course.) Sadly, attempts 
to alleviate institutional impositions from lectures-turned-teach-in to myriad awareness 
days have fallen short, even in the legal realm. 
Universities until only recently were trumpet
ing their own parental surrogacy over student 
choice and important free speech considera
tions. In effect, professors and administrators 
at Carnegie Mellon and any number of major 
universities followed the maxim, If they wont 
listen, well shut them up.
Mr* b
Grace Li/Art Staff
So speak out. Dont let your voice be reduced 
to a footnote in some conservative blowhards 
Internet tally of the days liberal abuses of 
higher learning. Students at CMU deserve 
more than just lip service from professors 
caught flagrante derelicto; they need the assur
ance that individual decision-making will be 
left up to them, and only them, without duress 
from professors or school deans. A lofty ideal 
that, I know. But what else, given the sorry 
record of our nations administrators, is there 
left to lose?

Mid-season 
evaluation, 
predictions
Chris thrrhanD
With the NFL season more than 
half-complete, it is becoming clear 
who will be chasing the Lombard 
Trophy in the postseason, and who 
will be taking an early vacation. 
However, it is not crystal clear and 
there are still plenty of question 
marks.
I figured Ive had enough time, 
and watched enough football, to 
make my midseason playoff predic
tions. Here are my top teams, and 
why theyll be there:
NFC: San Francisco, New Orleans, 
Philadelphia, and Green Bay will win 
their divisions. These teams are the 
ones I wasnt surprised about, and 
are establishing themselves as legiti
mate contenders for January. That 
leaves the two Wild Card spots.
I believe that Tampa Bay will conn tinue to roll for a little while, and 
Choke just enough to lose the divi
sion to New Orleans but not elimi
nate themselves from wild card con' tention. They have the best defense 
Y in the NFL right now, but they've had
0 a solid defensive unit for years now 
'and it hasnt gotten them any more 
than postseason frustration.
The key question in Tampa will be 
the offense; Brad Johnson exploded 
" last week for a career best five-touchdown performance. But one game is 
. not a good indication of how good 
the offense is. The Bucs have had 
plenty of dismal offensive perfor. mances this year to make me doubt 
;; them. I predict they will be the top 
 wild card spot, but the always explo; sive Saints will take the NFC South.
 The other wild card spot is tough,
* real tough. The pessimistic part of 
!; me screams out that the hated Rams 
! will turn it around once Kurt Warner
1 returns, and will take the final postseason spot.
 However, Id like to think that the 
<; Rams are not tough enough to over! come an 0-5 start, and will lose two 
!- away games (my guess is at 
", Washington and at Philly) to effec: tively eliminate them from playoff 
v contention. So if the Rams dont 
' make it, who will? 
r Thats the hard part: the NFC is 
t weak everywhere else.
; ; The Bears and Vikings are disap^ pointing. The Cardinals are doing 
! well, but are still a year or two away 
from the playoffs. My prediction is 
i that whoever wins between the 
% Rams and the Redskins when they 
f\ meet in Washington on November 24 
will be the final wild card.
The Skins have shown plenty of 
1 potential on both sides of the ball, 
i but have yet to pull it together with 
h any consistency. Last year they were 
a second-half team, and if they beat 
Jacksonville and New York before 
| - facing St. Louis, I think they have a 
j shot at the Rams. It depends on the 
b play of their quarterback, and if one 
Ss of those guys can pull it together in 
the next two weeks this team could 
f be scary.
I predict that Washington, as I 
* stated early in the season, will live 
;up to their potential and claim the 
ifinal wild card spot.
The AFC is a bit trickier, but I can 
J; take it. Denver, Miami, Pittsburgh,
[; and Tennessee will win the divisions. 
j^None of them, however, will win 
w convincingly. Pittsburgh and 
f Tennessee benefit from weak divi1 sions. The Steelers have a weaker 
\ division, but the Titans are not near| ly the team that the Iron City Boys 
. are, and need the weak division just 
to make it to the playoffs. Miami will 
r end their mini-slump, and roll on as I 
! predicted earlier in the year. 
r Denver is the most complete team 
. in the AFC, and should coast into the 
; postseason without much trouble.
| Wild card spots? Buffalo will get one. 
i I said it before, and Ill say it again: 
i Drew Bledsoe is a great quarterback, 
i he has been to the big game and 
J knows what it takes to get there. He 
| has the experience to pull this young 
| Bills team together, and squeak into 
i the postseason.
The other spot is between the 
\ Patriots and the Chargers. The 
J Raiders will continue to fall, but the 
| Bolts will rise up in the AFC West,
| and I claim they will be the final wild 
card team. I think the Bills and 
Dolphins will turn it on in the second 
half, and the Patriots wont have 
1 enough to get into the playoffs. The 
^^hargers have the perfect mix of 
J^good coaching, good leadership, and 
j^Jncredible young talent to turn some 
rlieads and play in the postseason.
Chances are the Bills and Redskins 
j will falter and prove me wrong, but I 
[ truly believe at least one of them will 
. pull it off and make the playoffs. Im 
i keeping an eye on the Falcons,
! Chiefs, and Raiders, but I dont think 
! any of those teams can put it all 
together in time for the postseason 
; Either way it should be a great sec; ond half of football, and you can bet 
' Ive got plenty of cold beer and hot 
i food to help me enjoy it.

Emory blocks a Tartan hit last Friday in the UAA Championships. Held at Case Western Reserve, the volleyball team could 
not get over the Eagles, losing in three tight games.
Volleyball earns 4th place at UAA 
tournament, hopes for ECAC bid
UAA, from page A16
gone either way. It was the best volleyball weve played 
all season. When we played them earlier we didnt come 
out as strong until the third game of th,e match. We knew 
what we had to do this time around.
The Tartans played two games Friday prior to facing 
Emory, easily defeating Case Western 30-20, 30-13, 
30-22, and Chicago, 30-16, 30-19, 30-23. Winning 
these two matches gave Carnegie Mellon a nine-game 
winning streak going into the match against Emory, but 
the momentum was not enough to win the match.
On Saturday, the Tartans played Washington 
University, who went on to win the UAA title for the four
teenth straight year, in the semifinal match, and lost in 
four games, 27-30, 30-27, 22-30, 21-30. The team hit 
just .210 for the match, but stayed in the game with its 
defense.
Even though the Bears jumped out to an early lead in 
the first two matches, the Tartans were able to fight 
back. The match went back and forth, but the Bears 
came out on top. Schmidt had 18 kills and hit .340 in the 
match. Bergvall tied her season-high in kills with nine.
We came out really fired up against Wash. U., said 
Bergvall. It was similar to the situation against Emory. 
We didnt win the clutch points to close out a game, so 
we didnt have the momentum starting the next game. 
We had to fight to get back into the game, and it was real
ly hard.
In their final match of the tournament, the Tartans 
played NYU for third place. NYU had been soundly 
defeated by both Emory and Wash. U. earlier in the tour
nament, so the Tartans felt they had an edge going in. 
But the match went five games, and the Tartans lost, 
30-18, 20-30, 30-22, 19-30, 12-15. The women were 
off their game, hitting only .150 as a team, one of their 
worst percentages this season.
I dont really know why we let down against NYU, 
said Bergvall. It was hard to force ourselves to play all 
out after playing Wash. U. so hard.
Against NYU, we didnt play as hard as we should 
have, said head coach Julie Webb. Also, we may have 
been a little tired, but that shouldnt be an excuse.
With its performance this weekend the team has elim
inated any chance of making the NCAA tournament. 
However, they players are looking to play in the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference (ECAC) post-season volley
ball tournament this weekend. They find out today 
whether or not they have earned a bid to the tourna
ment.
The Tartans finished the regular season 25-12, down 
from their 26-7 finish last season. The team is graduat
ing five seniors, all of whom played as first-years.
We had our highs and our lows, said Bergvall, on the 
season as a whole. I think we overcame a lot. Im happy 
with the volleyball we played. I wont remember this sea
son as a disappointment  Ill remember playing some 
great volleyball.
CMU, top schoob compete at Emory
SWIMMING, from page A12
First-year Julie Pavia, in her first 
major competition, placed second 
in the 1-meter, with a score of 
354.73, and first in the 3-meter, 
with a score of 390.14, edging out 
her teammate Finnegan.
The Invitational, usually held 
during the second weekend of 
November, has teams swimming 
what would normally be three days 
of competition over only two days. 
For the past four years the meet has 
been held at Carnegie Mellon, and 
was won last year by Emorys men 
and women.
This years change of venue to 
Emory provided a more mellow 
atmosphere for the competition.
The level of excitement is not 
what we are accustomed to, said 
Belowich. In contrast, the meet 
with Clarion last week, which was 
held at Carnegie Mellon, featured 
many more spectators and a higher 
level of excitement. Spectators 
were literally out on the sidewalk 
watching, Belowich said about 
last weeks home meet.
File Photo
The swim teams swam against Grove City at home two weeks ago. Home meets 
such as last weekends against Clarion draw enthusiastic fans and supporters. This 
weekends Emory Invitational didnt attract quite as many spectators.
Tartan football falls 
hard to Bears, 31-17
FOOTBALL, from page A12
The Tartans did manage those 
306 yards rushing on some nifty 
plays from the CMU running backs 
corps, a squad whose achievements 
this year have sometimes been over
shadowed by a poor overall team 
performance.
Leading the way for the Tartans 
was senior rusher Ricardo Clarke 
with 102 yards on 16 carries for 6.4 
yards a carry. Brad Stanley, a junior 
running back who has stepped up in 
recent weeks to fill the fullback role 
usually held by senior Adam 
Urbancyzk, contributed 47 yards 
and the teams first touchdown of 
the afternoon. Urbancyzk, himself 
back from the injured list after sit
ting out the past two weeks with a 
broken jaw, ran for 44 yards on 15 
carries and looked like his old self in 
short yardage situations. Senior 
quad-captain Sebastian Smelko 
rounded out the list with two rush
es, both reverses, for 33 yards and 
one score.
Wash. U. made it 10-0 when kick
er Ben Lamberts 33-yard field goal 
capped a nine-play 52-yard drive.
No amount of running, however, 
could spirit the Tartans away from 
defensive errors and the third down 
conversions of the Wash. U. Bears. 
Washington averages  254.1 yards 
passing and 24 points a game 
were both exceeded as the Tartans 
allowed 418 yards in total offense. 
In an ironic twist on Senior Day, 
first-year Bears QB Nathan Szep 
played like a savvy veteran, complet
ing 22 passes for 309 yards and two 
touchdowns. Duesing, another fji^styear, used his 6'3" frame to g^ab 
high jump balls around smajjer 
Tartan defenders, ending with 150 
yards and one TD. And a rarely-seen 
Bears rushing game produced 98 
yards and one TD on the feet of half
back Toby Neighbors. 14 of thri31 
points produced by the Bears c^ftie 
off of big third down conversions.
Despite a costly turnover at the 
games start and an anemic red zone 
conversion rate, the Tartans main 
shortcoming Saturday stemmed 
from a defense which seemed out of 
position and overmatched at certain 
points.
They [Washington] had a nice 
game plan; they stuck with it longer 
than we thought [they would], said 
a dispirited Bodnar. We just didnt 
execute as well as we thought we 
could.
The 31 points were the second 
most points allowed by the CMU 
defense this year. The most, 42, 
came by way of a loss to Case 
Western Reserve, the Tartans first 
UAA defeat. I obviously didnt pre
pare my people well enough, 
Bodnar said.
Whos Next: University of
Rochester (1-8, 0-3) at Carnegie 
Mellon (5-4, 1-2), noon Saturday 
at Gesling Stadium.
Last Meeting: The Yellowjackets 
opened the game in Rochester with 
a surprise onside-kick, and it 
seemed to stun the Tartans for a 
half. Rochester scored on the open
ing drive and went into halftime 
with a 20-3 lead.
Then the Tartans realized that 
they were a better team and scored 
27 unanswered points. The defense 
came up with three straight 
turnovers, including a fumble 
recovery in the endzone by line
backer Frank Adam that cut the 
lead down to three. The Tartans 
won the game 30-20.
The Skinny: The Tartans played a 
decent game last week against 
Washington, but still found them
selves blown out 31-17. The 
Yellowjackets were the latest team 
to get in a shootout with Case, the 
UAAs version of the Kansas City 
Chiefs. They lost 38-29, keeping 
them winless in the conference. 
Despite being 1-8, this team does 
play some close games, losing only 
31-21 to perennial powerhouse 
Union.
Watch For: The running backs. 
Against Washington University,
both halfback Ricardo Clarke and 
fullback Adam Urbanczyk came 
back early from injuries to play. 
Their replacements, halfback Jon 
Cakert and fullback Brad Stanley, 
both played very well in place of the 
injured starters and developed a 
flow during a strong stretch of play 
for the Tartans. Whatever the com
bination used, the Tartans amassed 
over 300 yards of rushing offense 
against a stubborn Washington 
defense, averaging a third of that 
against it.
Result: Rochester is not that good a 
team, and the Tartans are too tal
ented to lose to them. They will 
come out strong in front of th,e 
home crowd and will finish the year 
on a high note. In the process they 
will extend their streak to 27 con
secutive years with a winning stet
son record, not to 27 consecutive 
years without a losing season 
record. Carnegie Mellon 27, 
Rochester 10.i ro
Notes: The Tartans have not beafen 
Wash. U. since 1998 (30-21) la,lid 
have not won the UAA title since 
1997. Tartan quarterbacks Wykosky 
and Highberger finished 5 of 20 
passing for 62 yards. Only once this 
season has the Tartans quarter
back passed for over 100 yards in a 
game (Highberger, 11 for 29, 131 
yards against Johns Hopkins).

New boathouse will benefit 
city, college crew teams
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
Twin eight-berth rowing tanks 
located in a new boathouse along the 
Allegheny riverfront in Millvale 
Township will aid the training of the 
CMU Rowing Club.
Owned by the Three Rivers Rowing 
Association (TRRA), the $2 million 
boathouse will be used by the crew 
club for training only, and will not 
replace the clubs home bay at 
Washingtons Landing on Herrs 
Island.
The boathouse's training and stor
age buildings were opened to the 
public on Saturday.
The tanks, which feature circulat
ing water, will allow for extra train
ing during the winter months while 
providing unprecedented training 
opportunities. Coaches will be able to
access rowers to specifically maneu
ver them into form, while rowers can 
monitor themselves and teammates 
using mirrors and video equipment.
I expect that the team will gain 
invaluable technique training as a 
result of the addition of tanks to our 
winter training, said head coach 
Donald Webber-Plank.
This will really break the threemonth long monotony of erging and 
doing weight workouts for winter 
training, said junior rower Neal 
Turbow.
The center will also provide weight 
rooms, dry rowing machines, and 
meeting facilities for the club as well 
as TRRAs 2,000 other members.
The boathouse buildings anchor 
the Millvale Riverfront Park, a 13- 
acre recreational area along the 
Allegheny back channel aimed at 
continuing the redevelopment start
ed at Washingtons Landing.

How about a schoolin?
The AM-All Stars, a faculty, staff, and graduate student team, were no match for Liz Painter and the 
womens basketball team last Friday. The Tartans won the exhibition game, which came two weeks 
before the start of the regular season on Friday, November 22, in the CMU Tip-Off Tournament.
Tartan swimmers satisfied 
with results at Invitational
by Rebecca Cornelius
Assistant Sports Editor
The crowd at Emory didnt show up this 
weekend, but the Carnegie Mellon mens swim 
team certainly did, placing second out of four 
teams in the Emory Invitational. The womens 
team placed fourth.
The Invitational, which is something of a 
tradition between the teams, featured four 
mens national top 20 teams: in the NCAA 
mens championships last year, Johns Hopkins 
placed second, Emory placed third, Carnegie 
Mellon placed fourth, and New York 
University placed 20th.
The womens team also had good competi
tion, with Emory and Johns Hopkins, which 
earned third and fifth place in last years 
NCAA championships, respectively.
It was overall a pretty good meet for us. We 
had some pretty good swims, some not so 
good swims, said coach David Belowich. Its 
early in the season, and that tends to happen 
early in the season. But were moving in the 
right direction.
Everyone did very well. Its a good measure 
of where we are, and what we have to work 
on, he added.
Two main contenders for the men were 
Brian McCarthy and Chris Pearson. McCarthy 
took first place in four events: the 200-yard
backstroke, the 400-yard individual medley, 
the 100-yard backstroke, and the 200-yard 
individual medley.
Pearson took first place in three events: the 
100-yard freestyle, the 500-yard freestyle, and 
the 200-yard butterfly. The 200-yard butterfly 
win was particularly significant for Pearson, 
because according to Belowich, it is an offevent for the swimmer.
Juniors Steve Chiou and Brian Jucha also 
swam well. Chiou took second place in-both 
the 100-yard and 200-yard breast stroke 
events, and Jucha took first in the 50-yard 
freestyle, second in the 100-yard butterfly, and 
third in the 100-yard freestyle.
The men also had three first place relay 
teams. A team consisting of McCarthy, Chiou, 
Jucha, and Pearson won the 400-yard 
freestyle. Jucha, first-year Evan Powell, junior 
Derek Underwood, and Pearson won the 200- 
yard freestyle. Jucha, Powell, McCarthy, and 
Pearson won the 400-yard freestyle relay.
On the womens side, the Tartans had stand
out diving performances. Sophomore Mindi 
Finnegan, who was an all-American last year, 
placed first in 1-meter diving, with a score of 
355.93, and second place in 3-meter diving, 
with a score of 378.05. Finnegan placed first in 
both competitions at last years Invitational, 
which was held at CMU.

In midst of banner year, hockey team loses to St. Vincent, 3-1
by Tristan Hoffmann
Contributing Editor
Down one goal but playing with all the 
momentum, the Tartan ice hockey team 
seemed ready to take control with just under 
five minutes gone in the third period Saturday 
night against St. Vincents College. But they 
squandered a two-man advantage and saw a 
shorthanded goal by visiting St. Vincent finish 
off a 3-1 loss.
With 12:41 remaining in the third period 
and trailing 2-1, the Tartans found themselves 
with a two-man advantage for 1:31, but they 
failed to capitalize. And when St. Vincents first 
man got out of the box, the Tartans turned the 
puck over trying to clear the zone, and sopho
more Tom Ward beat first-year goaltender Dan 
Garmat with 10:46 remaining in the third peri
od.
It seems that our power play has been hurt
ing us more than it has been helping, said 
sophomore right winger Kevin Hutchison. 
Were having a lot of trouble in our defensive 
zone, and we just cant seem to move the puck 
up the ice.
Hutchinson scored the only goal for the 
Tartans halfway through the second period, 
when he received a pass from Jamie Bretz and 
brought the puck to the left face-off dot and 
fired a slapshot that beat St. Vincent junior 
goaltender Andrew Tully to the far side. That 
cut the deficit to 2-1 and gave the Tartans 
momentum.
I just got a great pass and was able to get a 
good shot on net, said Hutchinson.
St. Vincents opened the scoring in the first
period on the power play. Garmat made a 
strong initial save, but St. Vincents Ward put 
the rebound in the net to for the early lead. 
Junior forward Ben Komlos increased the 
Bearcats lead to 2-0 just 1:08 into the second 
period. He brought the puck from behind the 
back of the net on a wraparound attempt, and 
just squeezed the puck into the net.
We need to do a better job keeping tabs on 
the men on the ice, said sophomore defensemen Brian Schmella. Were not playing manto-man enough, and as a result were losing 
guys who find the puck and are open enough to 
score.
The Tartans had some chances late in the 
game to try and pull within one goal, but Tully 
was equal to the task. With about a minute 
remaining, first-year defenseman Devin Fell 
found the puck squirting out to him after a col
lision in near the blue line. As a result, he was 
sprung on a breakaway, where he went to the 
backhand but was denied by Tully. The Tartans 
continued to pressure and first-year left winger 
Derrick Chan found the puck in the slot after it 
deflected off Tully. But Chan could not fire the 
rolling puck. Tully turned away 29 of 30 Tartan 
shots on goal.
Our level of play matched theirs, said firstyear defenseman Igino Cafiero. We just had 
some bad bounces tonight. If we played them 
on another night, we couldve won.
Garman came up with the big saves to keep 
the game close. With 2:30 left in the second 
period, the Tartans faced a 5 on 3 penalty kill 
for 20 seconds during which Garman made 
two huge saves. In the third period, he made 
three big saves during the tail end of a 4 on 4. 
Overall, he stopped 34 of 37 shots against a

team that scored 20 goals in two games last 
year against the Tartans.
Were playing a lot better this year, said 
Schmella. Our defense especially has 
improved, but we still have a lot of room to 
bring up our overall play.
The loss dropped Carnegie Mellons record 
to 3-2 overall and 2-1 in the south division of
the College Hockey East League. The team 
started off 3-0, including an opening night 7-6 
win against Penn Sate West, last years champi
ons. They now prepare this week for a Friday 
night game at Allegheny College, then return 
to their home ice the next day for a Saturday 
evening tilt with West Virginia University at 
5:30.
Soccer earns 
first seed in 
tournament
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
The mens soccer team (16-0-0) 
has secured the first seed and a 
first-round bye in the NCAA 
Division III playoffs. The tourna
ment starts Wednesday, but the 
Tartans will not be active until 
Saturday when they will play the 
winner of Westminster (Penn.) vs. 
Otterbein (Ohio). Also in Carnegie 
Mellons region are Ohio Wesleyan 
and the University of PittsburghGreensburg.
The men finished the season as 
the only Division III mens soccer 
team without a loss or a tie, and 
won the UAA title for the third year 
in a row. Going into this tourna
ment, they are looking to outdo last 
years first-ever second-round 
showing.
The Tartans bowed out against 
the Messiah College Falcons in last 
years tournament after an agoniz
ing round of penalty kicks ended 
with a Messiah shot past the Tartan 
goal.
Of their prospective regional 
opponents, Pitt-Greensburg (19-1) 
is the only one Carnegie Mellon has 
faced this year. The Tartans handed 
the Bobcats their only loss in an 
overtime game on October 8, in 
front of a Gesling Stadium crowd of 
Bobcat partisans. Senior midfielder 
Adam Hibshman tapped a short 
pass in with 40 seconds to play for 
the win. In the physical contest, 
two players were ejected, including 
leading scorer James Steidel, who 
was issued a red card for launching 
a shot on goal after acknowledging 
the referees whistle.
Since the Tartans last regular 
season game against Case Western 
on November 2, the team has been 
preparing normally following a 
short hiatus. Sundays practice was 
one of the most rigorous held all 
season.
The tournament will be the 
finale for the teams four seniors, 
including Hibshman, who was 
injured before the beginning of the 
season.
Im as good as Im going to get 
this year, said Hibshman, adding, 
Every game could be our last.
Sophomore midfielder Mark 
Painter, who suffered an ankle 
injury during the Case game, is 
improving as well, but there is no 
firm decision on whether he will be 
able to play in the first game.
Saturdays game will be played 
against the winner of the regions 
lone first-round game at Gesling 
Stadium.

Tartans surrender to 
Bears, lose title chance
by Dain Pascocello
Forum Editor
ST. LOUIS, Mo.  On Saturday, 
Carnegie Mellon football put up some 
winning stats: 306 rushing yards, 24 
first downs, and 368 total offensive 
yards, only one turnover.
Unfortunately, this was but one 
side of the game story. The Tartans 
(5-4, 1-2) fell to the Washington 
University Bears (6-4, 4-0) 31-17 in 
an inconsistent performance that at 
times looked as spotty and shopworn 
as the turf at the Bears Francis Field. 
Through a combination of early 
errors, missed opportunities, and a 
failure to contain the deep ball, CMU 
came away with a tough defeat and a 
lost chance at sharing the University 
Athletic Association title with 
Washington.
A victory next week at home 
against University of Rochester 
would give the Tartans their 27th 
consecutive winning season. It would 
also give the Tartans a .500 mark in 
conference play and most likely a tie 
for second place. At the moment 
though, the Tartans would prefer to 
assess what went wrong against the 
Bears and take steps to correct key 
mistakes.
It was one of those deals where we 
were holding them, and the big play 
bug kind of bit us, said head coach 
Rich Lackner. A fumble recovery and 
two deep bombs resulted in three 
touchdowns. The list of horribles run 
off by Lackner occurred at different 
points in Saturdays contest, but their 
impact was enough to have repercus
sions for the Tartans through the 
games remainder.
The Tartans opening drive ended
at the Wash. U. 36-yard line when 
sophomore running back Brad 
Stanley fumbled. Defensive back 
John Woock recovered the ball and 
raced 69 yards to put the Bears up 
7-0 with 10:39 left to play in the 
quarter.
Late in the third quarter, a long 
strike to Bears receiver Brad Duesing 
for 56 yards ended a seven-play drive 
for 78 yards and increased the Bear 
lead 24-3.
Defensive coordinator Terry 
Bodnar noted that a few of his defen
sive backs were having some trouble 
with the Francis Field footing for 
most of the day. The 56-yard loft to 
Duesing was the longest Bear passing 
play of the afternoon and a serious 
momentum shift for a CMU team 
whose fortunes appeared on the 
brink of change early in the second 
half.
Senior defensive back Joe Manger 
had ended a potential Wash. U. score 
when he intercepted Bears QB 
Nathan Szep in the end zone. The 
Tartans proceeded to rush to the 
Wash. U. 22 before running back 
Ricardo Clarke was stopped well 
short on a 4th and one. Then came 
the bomb to Duesing.
Down 24-3 at the start of the 
fourth quarter, senior QB Mike 
Wykosky, who replaced sophomore 
Jarrod Highberger in the middle of 
the third quarter, handed the ball off 
eight times as the Tartans marched 
56 yards to paydirt. With nine min
utes to play in the game, Bears QB 
Nathan Szep completed a 42-yard 
pass to Duesing  the last of the 
three big plays for Wash. U.  setting 
up a touchdown that made it 31-10.

takes 4th 
inUAAs
by Daniel Kim
Staffwriter
In their final matches of the regular 
season, the Tartans competed in the 
2002 UAA Volleyball Championships 
held at Case Western Reserve 
University this past weekend, where 
they won their first two games but 
dropped their last three and finished 
in a disappointing fourth place. What 
wasnt disappointing, though, was 
the teams high level of play through
out most of the tournament, particu
larly against Emory and NYU, who 
played each other in the finals.
Senior outside hitter Lauren 
Schmidt made first team All-UAA for 
the second straight season, and setter 
Amy Bergvall and defensive specialist 
Christina Casella, both seniors, 
received Honorable Mentions.
The Tartans played Emory on 
Friday, and even though they lost in 
three games, the Tartans pushed the 
Eagles to their limit in a tight 33-35, 
32-34,26-30 loss. Both teams played 
intense and focused volleyball, which 
resulted in good digs, long rallies, 
and an exciting show for the other 
teams, coaches, and spectators. 
Schmidt led the team in kills (18) and 
digs (24). First-year middle hitter 
Chrissy Bartek hit a team-high .380 in 
the match.
We were really even matched, I 
think, said Schmidt. We played 
really well. We had our chances to 
win the game; it really could have

Luck of the Draw
How Housing's random selection binds strangers through the years
Its entirely possible that it was fated. That some
how you were blessed by the ever-elusive gods of 
Housing Services, your destinies were filed together 
and, before you knew what was happening, you had 
no idea how life couldve been complete before then. 
You are utter dorm soulmates, and, fighting all odds, 
you decide that living with anyone else just would not 
do. So instead of going with the Russian roulette-like 
room draw, you opt to usher in the next year, and in 
some cases the rest of your college years, with your 
freshman roomie. But how does one find this bed
room bliss amongst all the freshman awkwardness 
and personal space pet peeves? How does one come 
out a winner in the luck of the roommate draw?
According to the Association of College and 
University Housing Officers International, some 90 
percent of students who enter college have never 
shared a room with another person, and for most, if 
not all, of the incoming freshman, the nightmare of 
getting shafted with the living embodiment of the 
word loser is keeping them up at night. Sophomore 
math major c j wolfe was among the weary until he 
met his freshman roommate, now-sophomore physics 
major William Chase.
Before coming to CMU we both expected to get 
roommates from hell. And we both exceeded each 
others expectations, said wolfe.
Although it may seem that only a special few get a 
taste of this habitat happiness, turning your first 
roommate into your last roommate and new partner 
in crime is not as impossible as it may seem. First, 
although finding common ground is not a require
ment, establishing a mutual understanding and hav
ing a willingness to help each other out is crucial, 
especially for biology sophomore Dara Davenport. 
We take care of each other all the time, whether sick 
or healthy or happy or sad ... [and] we treat our 
apartment like a home, not just like the place we live.
Many students spend a good year thinking about 
who they might want to room with for the next year, 
but for Eva Chu, senior chemical engineering major, 
the decision to live with her current two roommates 
again and again was pretty simple. Katie [Drye] 
lived down the hall from me freshman year, then we 
were roommates sophomore year and Christine
"Before coming to 
CMU we both expect
ed to get roommates 
from hell."
[Ahearn] lived down the hall. We get along and it 
worked alright before, so why not? Junior year, the 
three of us moved in together and thats how its been 
since.
Few people who decide to live together past fresh
man year do it out of convenience and as a snap deci
sion, however. Most do it because not only did they 
have a roommate, suitemate, or floor mate with 
whom they could share chores willingly, they had a 
good friend at their disposal 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week. This is one of the main reasons William 
Chase decided to stick with his original roommate, 
Im really glad that c j and I decided to stay room
mates this year; though we  of course  have our 
differences, one of the main reasons that I think We 
stayed roommates is our myriad of common interests, 
c js being a math major and me being a physics major, 
we enjoy somewhat similar things academically... we 
read similar things, generally, like the same music.... 
The list goes on.

?0years ago, November 12,1952
The student body was disgruntled by poorly-maintained facilities, 
poorly-applied technology and inadequate technological instruction. 
Now that elections are over, read a group column written by Evening

what they are to do, and then more time is lost in trying to get the equip

year, due to rising operating costs and the need for new audio-visual and 
other machinery as part of CMUs attempt to stay abreast of the times. 
Dr. Richard Van Horn, Vice President of Business Affairs, cited a need to 
keep up with the offerings of other top-notch technical schools. We 
believe that in quality were as good as MIT or Cal Tech, he said, noting 
the popular opinion that comparable academic programming justifies 
an equal price tag. *

The advent of online registration proved inconvenient for students 
with minors and/or double majors, who, within the framework of 
assigned online registration dates, were to have no priority over other 
students. Without any sort of jump during registration, many students 
shy away from pursuing other majors out of fear of struggling to fulfill 
requirements, wrote The Tartan board in a group editorial.
At the same time, students were asked to vote on a referendum to 
increase the Student Activities Fee by thirty percent. According to The 
Tartan board, Most students do not see where the money goes, or how 
it is used.

still mostly true.

Dont tell me theres nothing to do in this city!
Lookin for [bike] adventure, and whatever comes my way
When somebody says theres nothing to do 
in Pittsburgh, I have to wonder what on earth 
it is that theyre looking for.
Just last week I stunned one of my teachers 
with a casual comment about how much I 
like this city. My only problem  if it can 
really be called a problem  is that there are 
too many things to do. Im a busy college kid 
and have a hard time making room in my 
schedule for fun most weekends. When some 
free time comes up and theres too much to 
do: do it all.
Feeling some germs threatening me the 
day before, I slept in good and late (and my 
body thanks me for it). Spent some quality 
hangout time with a friend or two, and met 
up with a small posse at 2 pm for a Very Long 
Bike Adventure.
After some pump-up music (ever notice 
that theres a song on Guns n Rosess 
Appetite for Destruction for any occasion?), 
we hopped on our mechanical horses and 
rode out to East Liberty for the vegan buffet 
lunch at the Shadow Lounge. But.no! 
Diverted to Plan B on the first step of the 
adventure! The food delivery people hadnt 
brought any food! So back onto our bikes and 
onward to the Quiet Storm for split pea soup, 
hummus, and vanilla-flavored condoms (a 
rarity for only a quarter!).
We biked back to campus via Millvale  a 
lovely, windy ride  minus one bike and 
rider, to meet up with another. Bottom to top, 
we checked out the Miller Gallerys Paradise 
Now exhibit, with mixed reactions, but gen
eral disappointment  it was mostly kind of 
boring, but Sweet Jebus! The stay-green 
grass portrait is amazing and totally surreal: 
a sign of things to come.
We dropped down to a three-person crew 
then, and at about quarter to five, headed 
down Neville Street into the hidden neigh
borhood and onto the jail trail. Cars on the 
interstate at a standstill, the river even stiller. 
Colors in the sky more vibrant than the graf
fiti on the underpass. Impossible not to be 
overwhelmed by the beauty of the cityscape.
Navigating Downtown by bike is a bit on 
the terrifying side during rush hour, especial
ly when youre not exactly sure how to get 
where youre going. But after minimal cir
cling, we made it to the Wood Street Galleries 
for the opening of For Real, where we scav
enged some free food and saw some more 
half-assed art. Some of it, though  particu
larly Margi Geerlinks digitally-altered photo
graphs  were subtle enough to hold our 
attention and make us wish we were brave 
enough to talk to her. Its surprising how 
much easier it is to talk to strangers when 
youre on assignment.
So we stood nearby, content to eavesdrop 
on her explanations of the photos, which she 
makes by taking slides of several different 
people in the exact same positions, and then 
morphing them into one image with, for 
example, four generations. One photo was a 
baby at his mothers breast, held in his grand
fathers arms, looked upon by his great
grandmothers face.
We stood around discussing realism and 
digital realism on the main floor until we got 
so freaked out by the breathing rooms pan
icked breathing noises that we had to go 
onward.
So off across the Smithfield Street Bridge 
(beautiful and cold cold cold) to the Warhol 
Museum for a quick run-through of the 
exhibits, a run-in with a crazy man, and 
then a show.
Are you bikers? this very 
quiet, very large man asked us, 
pointing to the helmets 
strapped to our bags 
Yes, yes were bikers, 
we answered 
How " many 
miles do you 
ride on a 
given 
day? he 
asked, 
and went 
on to talk 
about how when 
he was in college, 
he rode 75 miles a day 
on his bike. We began to 
realize that he was crazy, as 
he discussed going 35 miles an 
hour in New York stop-and-go 
traffic, and our suspicions were con
firmed when he told us how they 
watch him with satellites and monitor his 
bike riding.
But up to the top floor of the Warhol and 
down again! While Americanism is not some
thing I generally find appealing (how many 
times can they show us a Coke bottle and 
expect us to still be impressed?), the exhibit 
was well done in the juxtaposition of related
pieces. An audio supple
ment to a Jackson Pollockpainting played a poem 
written in response to the 
painting. Neither was espe
cially striking, but its rare 
to be able to see that sort 
of trivia side by side.
What the poem was in 
response to might have 
been a footnote, and 
had I read it on my 
own, Id never have 
sought out the painting.
Downstairs! Parker 
and Lily played a quiet, 
dreamy set, with projec
tions of people kissing in the background  
some who hardly opened their mouths, and 
some who looked to be eating their lovers 
faces. Very distracting, somewhat unsettling.
Projections continued for the Future Bible 
Heroes set, but this time we were treated to 
bizarre and unsettling footage of Edie 
Sedgwick talking, laughing, putting on lip
stick, sneezing, smoking, fidgeting, 
never staying still. I had to fight hard 
to watch the charming Bible 
Heroes. Claudia Gonson and 
Stephin Merritt (of Magnetic 
Fields fame) and a third 
band mate played their 
typically bouncy-buttragic songs with a 
strange balance 
of energy 
and calm
 the 
stage pres
ence of veter
an performers 
who refuse to 
become rock stars.
We made a quick trip 
downstairs to the photo booth 
(who knew there was a $2 clas
sic black-and-white four-pose 
photo booth in Pittsburgh?!). But it 
was, sadly, out of commission, so we sad
dled up again for the trek back across traffic 
to the jail trail again.
One member of the crew was in a rush not 
to be late to his own party, so the remaining 
two of us rode back along the chilly trail, rev
eling in having the road to ourselves, but a bit 
anxious about being alone on the dark trail. 
Upon returning (with some relief) to
Oaklands main drag, we walked past the 
excellent blind gospel singer man to get some 
tacos and earplugs.
After a quick stop into Qdoba, the new bur
rito joint on Forbes, we sated our ravenous 
selves with some pretty mediocre food, and 
headed to Club Laga around 11 pm, for the 
Grand Buffet CD release show, which hadnt 
even started by the time we got there.
Sage Francis started off the show with 
amazing electric energetic hip-hop thats still 
bouncing around in my head, followed by a 
not-particularly-thrilling set by Sole. Then 
this Evolution Control Committee mad scien
tist tried to bore us to death (a nice rest for 
the weary), and the Modey Lemon played a 
rather rock star-esque set. Evidence of a 
European tour? Perhaps, but theyre still 
from Pittsburgh.
The show didnt end till around 3 am, and 
the crowd was dragging by the time Grand 
Buffet came out, but energy picked up imme
diately, with silly string, George Bush cut
outs, 666 piatas, and innumerable guest 
appearances by such favorites as Ultimate 
Donnie, who thrilled the ladies in his tinted 
aviator glasses, spandex shorts, and a leop
ard print top. Theres pretty much nothing on 
earth like a Grand Buffet show. Theyre tough 
to catch since theyre constantly touring, but 
its insanity. Straight up dance party. Worth 
every exhausting minute.
End of show, end of adventure: we stum
bled outside and walked over to our bikes, 
got on, and rode home to sleep like the dead.

Whole Foods wants your whole wallet
Organic market gives competition to its East End adversary, but is the battle worth the pocket change of the consumer?
The fetishizing of the American palette did not begin 
with Whole Foods. Nor did it start with the East End Food 
Cooperative. The two natural food sellers, however, appear 
more than happy to oblige an American market increasingly 
bent on maximizing freshness, real or imagined. Indeed, in 
the past 15 years, organic foods and related products like 
free-range beef and pesticide-free produce have crowded out 
many of the older and cheaper non-organic varieties in chain 
grocers. The case could be made that with more and more 
Americans cooking these days (or attempting some crude 
approximation of it), the premium placed on fresh or natural 
food items is at its apogee. It seems curious, then, that many 
of us are so fat. In the very official-sounding 1999-2000 
National Health and Nutrition Survey, a shade over six in 10
 64.5% to be exact  of all adult Americans are obese. 
Groups such as the North American Association for the Study 
of Obesity see the levels as pandemic, and not set to ebb any 
time soon. So, with that sobering statistic in place, along 
come natural food purveyors Whole Foods Market and East 
End. The clarion call, such that it is, is unmistakable  if 
youre not going to eat less, then damnit, at least feel good 
about that third helping.
Whole Foods Market on Centre Avenue, a new addition to 
CEO John Mackeys clutch of 135 stores nationwide, is a big 
sprawling greenhouse  a thing similar to what Tobey 
Maguire described as what heaven looks like in the ponder
ous Wonder Boys  smack in the middle of a new government-planned gentrification spot in East Liberty. Whole 
Foods positions itself as an organic, gourmet grocer. The logic 
is that people will pay a little extra for a few sprigs of parsley 
if you can convince them with flashy labels and a fair amount 
of gamesmanship that their herbs are Weed Eater-free. Whole 
Foods, ostensibly holding onto some vestige of its hippie com
mune days as a green market in 1970s Austin, Texas embraces 
a collectivist ideology while being steered along by an unfet
tered capitalist ethos. Then again, strange bedfellows food 
culture and commerce have always made.
Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet is the theme 
here. There are no store managers  instead, it has team 
leaders presiding over team members (workers) and
teams (departments) 
working independently of 
one another but intercon
nected through a number 
of shared goals, not the 
least of which is the pur
suit of the next sale. The 
gushing continues at the 
check-out aisle, too.
Normally reserved for 
impulse buys and scream
ing tabloid headlines, 
Whole Foods has crowded 
out those baser sorts in 
favor of touchy-feely 
monthlies and home
opaths like Self, Yoga
Today, Wellness, and
Country Hearth maga
zines. There is the Ten 
Reasons to Buy Organic; 
the Take Action bulletin 
board; the Community 
News summary hugging a 
horseshoe-shaped eating 
area and coffee station. Is
Erica Barnes/Photo Staff
this an enlistment program or a supermarket?
But the Whole Foods product is unmistakable: this is qual
ity food that you will be at pains to find anywhere else in 
Pittsburgh. The meat section is stacked with marbled beef, 
thick slabs of pork loin, and sausage by the score. The fish 
department uses scoop bins for some its more exotic fare: 
king crab, escargot, and Portuguese potstickers nestle side-byside, twelve dollars a pound or more. There is also enough 
cheese to choke a fromaggier, thick rustic breads fresh from 
brick ovens, and better deli items than this reviewer has seen 
in Pittsburgh, period. Some of the prices are a bit much, con
sidering what youre getting  nine dollars a pound for mac
aroni salad?!  but it doesnt seem to be hurting business 
any.
The East End Food Co-op, by comparison, is a much more 
modest outfit. Taking a cue from the English cooperatives set 
in some leafy dens like Rochdale, East End is a customerowned enterprise. The offerings vis--vis Whole Foods are 
spare: some produce is hard to come by, because shipments 
may be lagging that day, or the markets patrons have already 
depleted the withering stock before noon of the same day. 
The adjoining caf is a vegetarians delight, with soups and 
toothsome sandwich choices. But for those of us with no feal
ty to either business, Whole Foods is clearly East Ends supe
rior. That health-conscious Americans are lusting after gourmet-style organic or natural food varieties in record numbers 
might not surprise you. That the Pittsburghers among them, 
when pressed, will opt for the mega-market over the local 
(and, by and large, locally-grown) co-op stuff, just might. 
Only in America.

A-SIDE: Jakob DylanB-SIDE: Natalie Cole
Does being the son or daughter of a successful musician hinder or help ones ability to be successful in music? Is it possible 
to escape the constant comparison to genealogical influence? The Mix Tape explores the effects of lineage on success.
While their name suggests a passive atti
tude, the Wallflowers, boasting lead singer 
Jakob Dylan, have been anything but. Son of 
rock legend Bob Dylan, Jakob seems to have 
followed in his fathers footsteps, picking up 
music at a young age and continuing to pur
sue it later in life. After several failed lineups 
and a label dispute, Jakob and his longtime 
musical collaborator and friend, Rami Jaffee, 
won a Grammy for their song One 
Headlight. The album, titled Bringing Down 
the Horse, helped to dispel sentiments that 
Dylans ability to achieve success was due 
chiefly to his musical lineage. Despite critics 
snide remarks, Dylan and the Wallflowers 
were able to win over fans based on their tal
ent without exploiting the father of folk.
Dylan began working with Jaffee while 
attending the Parsons School of Design. The 
two signed a record deal in 1992 with Virgin 
Records, which ultimately dissolved because 
of poor record sales. Club promoters com
plained of Dylans unwillingness to use his 
father as a form of promotion. The future for 
this rock legends son looked dismal.
After various member changes they finally 
found the ingredients for success. The new 
group, along with Dylan family friend and 
producer T-Bone Burnett, released Bringing 
Down the Horse on Interscope in May of 1996. 
Dylan couldnt have been more pleased with 
the way the band turned out. When I play in
a group, I depend' on them. If I had to hire 
musicians, these are the ones I would hire, 
Dylan said to the Salt Lake City Tribune short
ly after the albums release. Bringing Down the 
Horse sold over four million copies, and pro
pelled the band to fame of global proportions.
While Jakob Dylan received a lot of unde
served criticism 
regarding his 
desire to pur
sue a career in 
music, he and 
his band
proved they 
werent simply 
trying to
reproduce his 
fathers music.
Although the 
two can be 
compared lyri
cally, the
'Wallflowers sound 
is obviously more influenced 
by bands like Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers. The band is currently working 
on a third album, and Dylan is confident 
about the bands continued success. I think 
people need rock and roll groups, he told 
Music Magazine. Theres a place for every
body. Theres a place for Kiss, a place for 
Moby. Theres a place for everybody.
It would have been impossible for Natalie 
Cole to deny her calling to music. From an 
early age, Cole displayed diva qualities. She 
would often sing with her father as a child, 
sitting beside him on the piano bench. Her 
fathers death shook Coles dreams, howev
er, and at the age of 15, Cole was left father
less and abandoned music. Later in life, her 
musical destiny was sealed with a record 
contract. From the height of winning 
Grammy awards, to the low of 
drug and alcohol rehabili
tation, Natalie Cole has 
experienced multiple 
decades of success in 
the public eye as a 
renowned singer and 
daughter of a jaz^ 
legend.
The daughter of 
legendary Nat 
King Cole and 
Maria Cole, of the 
Duke Ellington 
Orchestra, Natalie 
was raised in a household built of chords, 
melodies, and love. She hid from the lime
light when Nat died after fighting a losing 
battle with lung cancer. She had no inten
tion of becoming a professional singer, but 
was drawn in to the local music scene at the 
University of Massachusetts Amherst, rekin
dling her childhood dream.
Her fathers record label, Capital Records, 
heard her in a Boston performance. They 
were quick to sign the soon-to-be diva and 
released her first album, Inseparable, in 
1975. The album earned Cole two Grammy 
awards in 1976 and was followed by a 
decade of success. Despite being an interna
tional sensation Cole abused drugs and 
alcohol. She checked into a rehabilitation 
clinic and by 1985 finally cleansed herself of 
the addiction. In 1993, Cole released her 
most acclaimed album to date, 
Unforgettable. The album is a tribute to her 
father who gave her life, talent, inspiration, 
and love. She covers many of his old classics 
and, through technological advances in 
music production, was able to sing a duet 
with the King himself.
It was Coles raw talent that pushed her to 
the top. Although she didnt seek fame, she 
didnt deny her family ties in an effort to 
prove herself to record executives and crit
ics. The release of Unforgettable was a trib
ute to her father rather than an effort to 
shake him off. In November 2000, she 
released a greatest hits album, which stands 
as a testament to the achievements shes 
accomplished on her own. Cole has demon
strated her love for her father through 
music, rather than thanklessly denying her 
lineage.

Shadows Fall constructs priceless guitar solos; California Guitar Trio prepares for world domination
Shadows Fall 
The Art of Balance 
Century Media
Standing at the confluence of 80s thrash, 
hardcore, and melodic rock, Shadows Fall 
(SF) brings a fresh North American view of 
fusion in heavy music. As their Swedish con
temporaries (In Flames, Meshuggah) are 
eager to do, SF brings the squealing guitar 
solos a la Justice For All era Metallica and 
layer them behind Cookie Monster vocals.
However, what sets them apart is their 
relaxed approach to composition. Simply 
put, the songs are well constructed, but 
without an overwhelming emphasis on pre
cision, which Europeans, frankly, have a lock 
on. And this works amazingly well. Anyone 
with even a tiny appreciation of music 
should have their heads nodding after a song 
or two.
After reading some initial reviews, I have a 
bone to pick with my colleagues: the vocals 
on this album are far more varied than I have
heard from SF, or their contemporaries. In 
fact, Brian Fair (vocals) actually sings from 
time to time, and it is an asset  not a detri
ment  to the work he does. In fact, Casting 
Shade, the first instrumental on the album, 
provides this contrast, sandwiched between 
the crashing waves of Destroyer of Senses 
and Stepping Outside the Circle.
While the Metallica-type hooks lead the 
first-time listener into comfortable territory, 
Shadows Fall has a distinct talent to follow 
that up by creating a type-of sonic imagery 
for the listener to follow. Case in point is the 
title track The Art of Balance. Oscillating 
between gentle light and dark shadows, 
Shadows Fall has a masterpiece on their 
hands. Just the solo about a minute in is 
worth the price of the album. Really.
Nevertheless, the songs are much greater 
than the sum of their parts. This is one of the 
albums that should bring metal-core com
mercial attention, and if any radio DJs want 
to get on the next wave of heavy music, there 
is no better place to start.

Inside Out Music
Take three musicians, one from Brussels, 
one from Tokyo, and another from Salt Lake 
City, and what do you get? A California trio 
that plays acoustic guitar that is both soothing 
and exhilarating. Whether its on the Greekinfluenced Melrose Avenue, the gentle 
Skyline, or the (I just cant put my finger on 
where its from) Hangasa, California Guitar 
Trio (CG3) sets a definite mood. Everything 
from jazz to surf rock to classical is present in 
their pieces, although not all at once. As fans 
of prog rock, Bert Lams (guitar, tenor guitar), 
Hideyo Moriya (guitar, mando-cello), and 
Paul Richards (guitar, slide guitar) leave no 
stone unturned. In fact, they met at a 1987 
seminar by Robert Fripp (King Crimsons gui
tarist). After touring with Fripps League of 
Crafty Guitarists until 1990, they formed 
CG3. Touring coffeehouses and clubs brought 
them their loyal following among guitar 
fanatics, and it seems that they are poised for

world domination, or at least bigger clubs. 
This is a great intro for newbies when it comes 
to acoustic rock, or fans of Steve Vai and Joe 
Satriani, for that matter. And theres no better 
time to start then tonight when they play 
Rosebud in the Strip District.
See you there,

mentioned this, all agreed, except for a duck. The only 
duck admitted to the program that year, this duck ridiculed 
us all for being human, believing he was so much better 
than us. In the coming years, I came to agree with him. 
With the onset of war, I could take no more of civiliza
tion, and I moved in with Quackers and his friends. We 
spent the days working outdoors, and the evenings dis
cussing books. And while the rest of the world worked hard 
to destroy itself, we sat peacefully like civil ducks, content 
with our simple lives.
