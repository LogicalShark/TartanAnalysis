Paolo and Francesca, that beau
tiful story of those ideal lovers 
whose tragic fate was fore-ordained 
rfrom the foundation of the world 
was presented by the department 
-of dramatic art on Wednesday and 
Thursday evenings, May 23 and 24, 
in the theater of the School of Ap
plied. Design. It was a very happy 
choice; the work of the two casts 
was surprising and gratifying in the 
very high artistic interpretation of 
this famous tragedy. It revealed un
suspected powers on the part of 
the performers. There was a decid-edly noticeable improvement in dic-tion and in voice control, this was 
^perhaps the most salient difference 
between this production and all the 
other work of the year.
This performance also evidenced a 
lively appreciation of the artistic 
value of restraint and poise and as 
^losing production of the school 
reflects decided credit on the 
f) both students and faculty.

BERTY LOAN MEETING 
HELD IN MUSIC HALL
In furtherance of the proposal conlained^in the letter from Mr. R. A. 
Franks, as is explained in another 
column of this issue, there was a 
great Liberty Loan meeting or the 
entire Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology Family in Carnegie Music 
Hall, Tuesday morning, May 29, at 
10 oclock.
Following this meeting, Director 
Hamersclilag addressed the faculty 
upon the proposed summer courses 
in the various departments, and the 
four quarter term, as it was advocat
ed by the meeting of college presi
dents at Washington.
TAU BETA PI HOLDS 
LITERARY LUNCHEON
Last Wednesday evening the mem
bers of Tau Beta Pi gathered around 
a table at the National Restaurant 
in Oakland and enjoyed a feed. 
Several short talks were given on 
such topics as:
The Engineering Plant.
Studies and Outside Functions.
Officer's Training Camps.
The Value of a Library to the 
Engineer.
The Industrial Reserves.
The Factors Essential to the Suc
cess of an Engineer.
It is hoped that another such 
meeting will be held before the 
close of the school year.
In spite of the great rusn for uni
form material, the committee on 
uniforms was able to announce last 
Thursday that the long looked for 
uniforms were ready for delivery. 
Approximately 200 men have already 
donned the khakis and the cam
pus now presents a military aspect. 
The men were a trifle slow in getting 
into action, but with three more 
weeks of hard drill, the regiment 
can show the visitors something 
when commencement comes.
There is still some money left of 
the special loan fund, and men who 
are una.ble to buy their uniforms 
outright are urged to take advan
tage of it. All men should be in 
uniform for June 5, and June 14th.
The committee announcement 
concerning uniforms was as follows:
A limited supply of complete uni
forms are now on hand at the 
Uniform Dept, of Kaufmanns The 
Big Store and fresh lots are ar
riving from day to day.
All men may now make pur
chases either by cash or by the 
requisition of the Student Loan Bu
reau (Mr. McCorkle) at this store at 
the price before stated, namely $8.15 
per uniform of hat, coat, breeches 
and leggins. A hat cord (special) 
will have to be supplied later at an 
additional cost and may not be used 
this year.
"In case you cannot be supplied 
at the above mentioned store you 
will find on hand at the Pittsburgh 
Uniform and Tailoring Co., 3rd Floor 
Jenkins Arcade, another stock at 
the same price $8.15, from which you 
may make your - purchase but only 
on a cash basis, requisitions being 
good only with the Kaufmann Com
pany.
"This uniform cosists of the regu
lation cotton olive drab service uni
form of the army, with dull bronze 
buttons on coatfelt hat with safety 
cord and "Ideal leggins. Be sure 
that you get the regulation. The 
leggins should have the maker's 
name in them.
"It is highly desirable that all men 
appear in uniform next Monday and 
such uniforms may be worn about 
the campus or at classes at any 
time.
Also these uniforms are regulation 
at the various training camps at 
which you are required to supply 
your uniform, and in any company or 
companies maintained by this organ
ization during the summer months, 
and is also the official uniform of 
the corps at Tech for next year.
"On Decoration Day, Wednesday, 
May 30, at 9 oclock, there will be an 
officers meeting
On the afternoon of Class Day, 
June 14, at 3 oclock there will be a 
review of the companies and a com
petitive drill This affair is sched
uled in connection with the Com
mencement program of the week. 
Every man should endeavor to be 
present on time.

PRESIDENT ORR OFFERS 
SENATE SUGGESTIONS
Committee Will Issue Consti
tution In Booklets At 
Fall Registration
The contingencies of war have 
caused quite a shaking up in the 
Science Senate, but the organization 
is still on the job and making plans 
for important work during the com
ing year. Three of the five Senior 
Senators, including President Orr, 
have gone into military service; one 
Sophomore, Paferbach, has left for 
farm work, and Butts, another Soph
omore, expects to be called into ser
vice soon in the Engineer Corps. 
The report of President Orr upon the 
work this year is well worth pub
lishing and is as follows:
The Student Senate,
"School of Appled Science, 
'Gentlemen:
In transmitting to you a short 
annual report covering the office of 
President of the Senate, I may say 
as a farewell that it is my opinion 
that annual reports should be re
quired of all officers on leaving of
fice. The advisability of requiring 
the report needs no mention.
As to what we have done this 
year, you are well acquainted with; 
the evolution of the school constitu
tion by a committee representing all 
the classes, its ratification, and the 
early organization of the minor de
tails of the Senate.
As a result of four years of 
work and association with the 
Science School, any person observes 
changes that might be well made for 
the improvement of general condi
tions. This brief report will but 
mention several of the more impor
tant things which have attracted my 
attention. I take the liberty, there
fore, of making the following sug
gestions:

Mr. Charles J. Taylor, who for 
several years has had charge of the 
Illustration course, has been elected 
by the faculty of the Painting and 
Decoration Department as its head. 
Mr. Taylor is one of the first men in 
modern illustration in this country, 
having illustrated for Harpers, 
Graphic, Century and worked for a 
great many years on Puck. He was 
on the jury at San Francisco Fair 
and his paintings are exhibited at 
many current exhibitions of many 
museums throughout the United 
States.
Mr. Taylor should also be re

SENIOR GIRLS GIVEN 
TEA BY SOPHMQRES
The Margaret Morrison class of 
1919 gave a tea in honor of the 
Seniors, in the Recreation hall last 
Wednesday.
The Sophs did not conduct them
selves with their usual levity, owing, 
perhaps to the fact that the pres
ence of so many Seniors was rather 
too great an honor.
However, their attempts at small 
talk were finally successful, result
ing in many entertaining chats and 
also in discovering that the seniors 
were quite human after all.
Favors were dainty pink crepepaper candy-baskets. Doubtless, 
many will be cherished in remem
brance. of a very happy afternoon.

The following principles and reso
lutions were unanimously adopted at 
a conference of presidents of Ameri
can1 colleges and universities at 
Washington, D. C., on May 5, 1917.
In the supreme crisis that con
fronts the nation the colleges and 
universities of America have the 
single-minded thought and desire to 
summon to the countrys service 
every resource at their command, to 
offer to the nation their Cull strength 
without reservation, and to conse
crate their every power to the high 
task of securing .for all mankind 
those ideas and ideals that gave 
birth and out of which have grown 
their most precious traditions.
"In order that such service may 
be most intelligently developed and 
applied, the following declaration of 
principles is respectfully suggested.
tit is our judgment that our collegs and universities should so or
ganize their work that in all direc
tions they may bo of the greatest 
possible usefulness to the country in 
its present crisis.
We therefore bellove, that all 
young men below the ago of liability 
to the selectivo draft and those not 
recommended for spocial sorvice, 
who can avail themsolves of the op
portunities offered by our collogos, 
should be urged to do so in order 
that they may bo able to render the 
most effective service, 'both during the 
full period of the war and In the 
trying times which will follow Its 
close.
We believe, second, that all col
leges and universities should so mod
ify their calendars and curricula as 
will most fully subserve the prosont 
needs of the nation and utilizo most

Wilkinsburg High School won first 
place in the annual interscliolastlc 
track and field meet under the au
spices of Carnegie Tech at the Schenley Oval last Saturday, scoring 43 
points. Schenley was a close second 
with 3S points.
' In the dual meet Carnegie won from 
P. A. A., 73 to 53. Although the 
weather was fine for a meet, no par
ticularly unusual event in either con
test took place.' Ellerton again 
broke the school record for the shot 
put by three inches.
McMaster, former Pitt star, was the 
Individual winner of the dual meet. 
He won the pole vault and broad 
jump, was tied in the high jump and 
was third in the low hurdles. Guy 
I-Iaferty, a former Tech man, won 
both hurdles, a second In the 100 
yard dash, and a third in the 220, 
earning the same number of points 
as McMasters. Lingenfelser won both 
short dashes for Tech, and Barry

RED CROSS EXAMINATIONS 
GIVEN TO TECH GIRLS
Eighty-four girls from the Mar
garet Morrison and Design Schools 
have taken the examination in Red 
Cross First Aid Work. Dr. Decker 
gave the examination. Those who 
passed it will get diplomas from 
Washington. Some of the girls are 
now taking up the more advanced 
work, Including Dietetics and Home 
Nursing.
Mrs. Samuel Semple, a member of 
the State Department of Labor and 
Industry, and president of the Feder
ation of Womens Clubs, spoke to 
the M. M. C. S. girls in their as
sembly last Wednesday morning on 
the economic condition of the state, 
dwelling particularly on the woman 
and child labor problem.
Mrs. Semple first brought greet
ings to the institution from former 
Dean West with whom she had at
tended a recent convention. She 
then went on to tell of her work on 
the Industrial Board and explained 
its purpose which is to make the 
process of earning a living safe and 
proper for everyone. Home work, 
is being wiped out and the hours 
and conditions of labor in factories 
and mills have already been greatly 
bettered although this department 
was only founded in 1913.
General welfare should be the 
gift of industry, Mrs. Semple said 
and now since war has been de
clared, we do not want to further 
endanger our general welfare and 
efficiency by letting down the bars 
of child labor legislation as Eng
land has done.
The talk was especially fitting to 
girls who are expecting to take civil 
responsibilities upon themselves, as 
all college women should, and to 
women working for equal franchise.
SENIORS GIVE FAREWELL 
DINNER TO FACULTY
On Thursday evening the Senior 
girls of Arts and Crafts, gave a. 
farewell dinner and "movie party 
to the faculty members of their de

after which the party adjourned to 
the Strand.
MISS HOLMES LECTURES 
TO HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS
Miss Holmes, head of the Secre
tarial Department of tho Margaret 
Morrison School, talked to ilvo 
hundred girls In the seventh, eighth 
and nine grades at tho Latimer High 
school on "Vocational Education. 
She emphasized tho fact, that al
though speed in typewriting and 
short hand act as a wedge to obtain 
business positions, personality and 
initiative are more important.
This was one of a series of voca
tional talks that are being given in 
the citys schools.
The program for Tuesday after
noon, June 5, at school is as follows: 
2:00Classes dismissed.
2:30Drill and Review of Regiment. 
3:00Presentation of colors by Mrs.

School Lawn.
One of the biggest, and perhaps 
the most significant pageants, ever 
staged here, is planned for Registra
tion Day, June 5tli. Detailed pro
grams will bo out soon. It Is hoped 
to hold the pageant on Forbes Field 
or some other location where large 
crowds can bo accommodated. Prof. 
Stevens is attempting no less a task 
than to represent the motives back 
of the present international catas
trophe with all the skill in pageanty 
which he can command. Briefly, 
tho pageant will represent the pre
sentation of tho case of each of the 
allied nations before the court of 
Liberty, Justice and Truth. It will 
l... do from 50 to 75 people in the 
cast, mainly students of the Depart
ment of Drama. If the prosent plan 
are carried out It is hoped to print 
this pageant and to offer It, togotlier 
with tho services of the personnel 
involved, to Lhe Recreation Commit
tee of tho War Department for use 
if desired In other centers through

ATHLETICS
The baseball, track, and tennis teams have not come up to 
expectations this year. The baseball team has lost a majority of its 
games through some little mischance '\vhosp disastrous effect was 
heartbreaking. The track team was unable to score a first in the 
track events oi! the Pitt dual meet. The tennis team lost to Pitt 
when comparative scores against Penn State indicated that Tech 
had every advantage. There is no doubt but that there has been 
a reasonable excuse in some cases; still no form of self delusion will 
obscure the fact that our athletes are not having the success which 
should ordinarily attend their efforts.
In searching for the reason, the first thing that comes to mind 
is necessarily tho war. Not only has military duty taken many of 
our athlOtpB from us, but the situation has so demoralized the 
general student attitude that sport as well as study has suffered. 
The prevalent air of excited expectancy makes it impossible for 
one to do his best work.
Nevertheless the colleges of the country, along with our own 
school, are now alive to the fact that athletics must be continued. 
President, Wilson, in an open letter to tho universities, himself 
advised such action; and following his declaration, many of the in
stitutions which had precipitately rushed into an abandonment of 
sport have now reversed their decision for next year. The wis
dom of their later course seems obvious. Never before lias it 
been so essential that the young men ol! the country keep them
selves physically fit. Never before have athletics been so democratic; 
usually I lie make up of a team is fairly well known before prac
tice' starts because certain men are sure of a place, but now the 
better athletes are generally gone and there will be a real dem
ocratic struggle between the rather mediocre men. who are to be 
left. The task which lies ahead of a coach next year is worthy 
ol! his greatest efforts; then we shall see whether college sports 
really are beneficial for the majority or only for the favored few.
Such is tho situation which confronts us in regard to football. 
There will probably be a schedulers arranged; the struggle for 
position and the difficulties of coaching will probably be as wc have 
said. 'Whether or not. the poor results which we are now ex
periencing wi1,1 also bo present is a matter to be decided and not to 
be lei!I; to chance, hi. one way til; least we can all do our bit in. 
helping to keep defeat away,- we can provide the good high school 
men of our home towns with information regarding Tech. Once 
the Selective Conscripti.on Act .becomes operative, it is probable 
that the classes entering college will be as large as ever, and that 
these young men will continue in college for several years at least. 
There is no reason, then, why wc should not use honest persuasion 
to induce high school men to come to our school. In the second 
place we should use our influence to overcome the I dont care 
spirit. which the war has introduced. Only by defeating this de
pressing psychological influence in ourselves and by bringing others 
with u's next year can we at Tech hope to carry out successfully 
President Wilsons wishes in regard to college athletics.

The following letters, which ex
plain themselves, have been mimeo
graphed, and copies sent to the offi
cers and employes of Carnegie Tech 
by the Directors office. That the 
plan is a good one, and that those 
who are able to do so should take 
immediate advantage of it is obvious. 
Everyone knows the object ' of the 
Liberty Loan, and realizes that lie 
should do all in his power to sup
port the movement, and it is grati
fying to learn that the Carnegie cor 
poration is dqing so in so practical a 
manner:
May 22, 1917. 
My Dear Mr. Church:
"The Carriegie Corporation has 
subscribed for as large an amount 
pf the bonds of the Liberty Loan 
as its obligations will at present 
permit. The Corporation would be 
glad also to assist members of the 
five Carnegie institutions who may 
desire to subscribe for bonds and 
pay for them in mouthy instalments 
Tills could be accomplished in the 
following manner: The teacher, of
ficer or employe could indicate to 
the Treasurer of his own institution 
the bond for which he desires to sub
scribe and the monthly payment ho 
desires to make. The Treasurer of 
the Carnegie Corporation would then 
sot. aside in the name of the sub
scriber the bond mentioned, the 
monthly payments would he credited 
to the Individual and when tho bond 
is paid for it would-bo forwarded. 
Interest 011 the deposits would bo 
credited at. the same rate of Interest 
011 the bonds.
To illustrate: A member of one
of these institutions desires to take 
a $500 bond and to pay for it in in'-'l^eiitof $25 a month. A $500 
bond' will be set aside in his name.
monthly payments will be cred
ited with 3%% interest. When his 
payments have been completed the 
bond will be sent to him through 
the Treasurer of his institution.
This arrangement is suggested in 
the belief that many men of moder
ate means will desireto take part in 
this patriotic effort if it can be 
done by payments extending over a 
considerable time. I shall be glad to 
know if this arrangement would 
meet any need and be availed of to 
any considerable extent by those 
connected with your institution.
Very very truly,
(Signed) R. A. FRANKS,
Vice Prsident and Treasurer.
tionin - ojrder that you may take-it 
up with the members of your offi
cial family.
I am .trying to arrange, for, a 
meeting in the. Lecture Hall, or pos
sibly in' the Music mall, for next 
TUesday, at which this; matter can 
be thoroughly explained to -all con 
cerned and Committees can then be 
appointed to take subscriptions. 
Sincerely yours,

"May 24, 1917. 
My Dear Dr. Hammersclilag:
I have just received a letter from 
Mr. R. A. Franks, Vice President and 
Treasurer of the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York, a copy of which 
I enclose for your information and 
which relates to a purchase of 
United States Government Liberty 
Loan Bonds made by tho Carnegie 
Corporation of New York. You will 
note that Mr. Franks proposes to 
act as purchasing agent for any of 
t,h" officers and employes of the Car
negie Institute, the Carnegie Library 
or tho Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, and to purchase Liberty 
Loan bonds for them on the payment 
of 5% of tho principal each month, 
and that, ho will credit them 011 all 
payments so made at the rate of 3J% 
interest. There will be no 110 charge 
by him in the way of commission of 
interest.
This seems to be a highly ad
vantageous opportunity for the offi
cers and employes of our various 
Carnegie Institutions in Pittsburgh 
to participate in the Liberty Loan, 
and I am giving you this informa-1
Through the courtesy of the Ailing 
& Cory Company, the Department of 
Printing has obtained some moving 
picture reels showing the entire pro
cess of paper making at the S. D* 
^Varren Company, Cumberland Mills, 
Maine. These reels informed you 
how Human Ingenuity nas taken 
the product of the forest and trans
formed it into the printed book. Mr. 
Harry L. Gage, gave an expanatio: 
of the reels, describing how extreme 
ly difficult they were, to obtain, and 
his bearers felt that they had heard 
something well worth wh'ie when 
they left the assembly room.
This illustrated talk was given 
in Room 104, of the School of Ap
plied Industries, on Wednesday, May 
23, at 1 p. m.
The following titles will give you 
an idea of the processes which will 
be covered. To obtain the pano
ramic view of the mills, it was nec
essary for the cameramen to ascend 
to the top of an incompleted sodapulp mill; the operators foot slipped 
and he very nearly ruined himself and a thousand-dollar camera. 
It is due to his presence of. mind 
that tbese pictures are offered to 
you.

NEED FOR FARM HANDS
The following information, has 
'leen received from the cooperative 
Public Employment Bureau at Kan
sas City, Mo.:
Mr. W. G. Ashton, labor commis
sioner, office at Oklahoma City, 
Okla., states as follows: Harvest
will start about June 8th to 10th, 
in North Central Oklahoma; Enid 
and Oklahoma City will be the main 
distributing points for this portion 
of the state. The wages Will not 
be less than $2:00 per day and up, 
including board and lodging. We 
have made a very careful survey oi 
the situation and have concluded 
that it will require 5,000 men this 
year. Persons who contemplate 
starting the season in Oklahoma 
should first communicate with Mr: 
Ashton to find out whether or not 
employment will be available for them 
upon arrival.
The wheat crop of Kansas prom
ises to be much lighter this year 
than last. Many counties having 
large acreage last year will have 
none this season. However, thirty 
counties located in the South Central, 
Central, Northwest sections of the 
state ask for 15,000 men from out
side sources. Wages will probably 
range, as last year:v ordinary hand 
to $3 per day, stackers, $3.50 to 
$5.00; engine-men $3.50 to $6.00; in
cluding board and lodging. The cut
ting in Kansas starts a few days 
later than in Oklahoma, this is, 
about June 15th to 20th. The State 
Commissioner of Labor, Topeka, 
Kansas, will furnish detailed inform
ation upon request.
Many start the season in Oklahoma 
and work North, winding up in the 
Dakotas or Minnesota, and in this 
way they get in about three months 
work at good wages. Lucrative em
ployment can be found in the thresh
ing. Where the wheat has been 
spoiled other crops are being put in. 
In the fall good wages can be made 
husking corn. The majority of farm
ers who want harvest hands prefer 
able-bodied English-speaking white 
men.
All persons desiring harvest work 
must bear cost of transportation to 
and from the fields.
We 'do not know of any way in 
which free or reduced fare may be 
obtained. It is unnecessary to pay 
any fee in connection with the mat
ter of obtaining employment in the 
harvest fields. Government and 
state employment offices are in pos
session of all necessary information 
and will gladly furnish advice free 
of .cost. Applicants should have 
sufficient funds for subsistence in 
the event of unavoidable delays in 
commencing harvest.
Persons who will communicate with 
this office between June 1st and 10th 
will be directed to employment by 
letter, if so desired, but all who can 
conveniently do so are urged to 
travel via Oklahoma City, Okla.; 
Topeka, Kan.; Omaha, Nebr.; or 
Kansas City, Mo. This in order to 
obtain the latest information con
cerning crop conditions, points where 
men are needed, etc.
During the season Kansas City will
be^fehe main distributing point and: 
will be in daily touch with allpoints of the wheat belt.

expressed in the admonition of Lucrezid.youUi goes toward youth 
in the simple and unconscious way 
that Giovanni (Mr. Wm. Mulli
gan) the micldle-aged soldier con
fides, .his child-bnde, Francesca,., to 
ihe proi iH-i ion of. his beloved and 
handsome younger .brother Paolo 
and so layed the foundation of all 
the ensuing. woe.
Mr. Mulligan met the trying situa
tion in this highly tragic role, where 
the temptation to overact is great, in 
an artistic and convincing manner. 
Emotionally it -is one,of the heaviest 
roles tha.t has been played on Design 
Stage and was Mr. Mulligans first 
essay at tragedywhich makes his 
success-the more noteworthy, although 
it: might have been anticipated from 
the nature of his earlier work.
'Ric&ard Mansfield II played the 
same role in the second cast with 
equal success although his interpre
tation was on an entirely different 
key, suggesting more of the flesh 
and less of the spirit. The reading 
ofhis lines ^Vas admirable and his 
diction irreproachable. He appears 
to' have: a native instinct for jesture, which, if not carried too far,

is a potent aid Jo expression. ,He is 
to be commended for th reserve 
with which he played the role con' 
sidering his temperamental tendency 
to extravagant self expression.
Mr. Norwood Engle gave a. very 
poetical interpretation of Paolo, 
being well-favored by nature for 
such a role. The -velvety, quality of 
his voice'lent spcial charm to scene 
3, act III, where he and Francesca 
read of the loves of. Launcelot and 
Guinevere. Hetoo. displaysthat 
freshness of feeling which makes the 
world seem always young.
In the second cast Mr. Hubbard 
Kirkpatrick presented an ; older 
Paoloa man more, fully conscious 
of the certain doom of such a great 
joy as his and the shadow of this 
impending doom appears to follow 
him always,  tempering all that li 
says and does. The sonorous quality 
Of his voice was neveV more evident 
than in the garden scene, in the 
reading of Launcelot and Guine
vere; It is the most artistic thing 
Mr. Kirkpatrick has ever done. .
Miss Mary Ricards made a wonder
fully charming Francesca da Rim
inithe bride of Giovanniwho 
comes to her grey soldier-husband 
with the very breath of the cloister; 
still about her, trembling at lir 
advent into the great, strange worid 
where Paolos hand has led her. She 
seems to feel even then the impend
ing fate that awaits her not far to 
se.elc. Her appeal to ones sympathy 
is immediate and she holds it till 
the final curtain. She possesses a 
sincerity of utterance which added 
greatly to the charm of her interpre
tation. Her "Francesca will be re
membered as one of the really de
lightful characterizations of the. sea
son.
Miss Eula. Guy essayed the same 
role in the second cast and in it 
gave the most artistic characteriza
tion of her career. She managed 
her voice with unusual skill and dis
cretion and displayed a sense of 
artistic values in the reading of her 
lines, which is a marked advance 
over anthing she has achieved be
fore. She entered more fully into 
the role of "Francescaportraying 
both the feeling and the charm of 
this unhappy bride to whom love 
comes only to lead her to her death 
than any other character which 
she has interpreted.
Mr. Frederic McConnell s "Pulci, 
the apothecary, gave his usually de
lightful interpretation of this quaint 
type of character: he has the happy 
faculty of throwing what might be 
called a small part into very strong 
relief through his careful attention to 
detail. Nothing, that might add in 
in the least to the artistic value of 
the role is beneath his notice and the 
inevitable result follows, Mr. Me-. 
Connell always scores in any produc
tion in which he participates.
Miss Lucy Barton gave a very 
convincing interpretation of Luerefcia, counsin of Giovanni, manifest
ing more histrionic ability in the 
portrayal of this role than has ap
peared in any of her former Work. 
The reading of her lines in this per
formance was noticeable for im
provement in tone quality and an 
artistic control of register which 
added materially to her success in 
this rather difficult characterization 
where poise becomes such an im
portant factor.
Angelablind nurse to Giovanni, 
has but a brief though important 
moment in the play, where in a 
vision she fortells the fate of Fran
cesca to Giovanni. The role has 
something uncanny and thrilling 
about it as played in the two casts 
by Violante Bollinger and Miss Mar
guerite Bollinger. Both have voices 
remarkable in depth and quality of 
tonevoices which can make one 
shiver and creep if they chooseand 
which lend themselves most natural
ly to tragedy and help much in 
creating atmosphere. Their work 
had the same artistic quality that 
characterized the work of the entire 
cast.
Miss Hazel Becks Nita, maid 
to Francesca, was played with her 
usual charm and skill. It is one. of 
the few bright and cheerful charac
ters in the play.
Miss Katherine Jones made a very 
interesting Tessa  daughter to 
Pulci the apothecary and her sup
porting cast in this scene (the Misses 
Dye, Dice, Rubenstein and Krebs), 
were both clever and amusing.
Miss Esther Fromme's Costanza, 
was very acceptably done, while the 
other supporting members of the 
east (Church, Hogan, Reid and Wm. 
Viehman), were adequate in every 
respect to the work entrusted to 
them.
The production was splendidly 
staged under the personal direction 
of Prof. Thomas Wood Stevens. The 
period of the play called for costumes 
graceful in line and rich in texture 
and color (Misses Barton and Jones, 
eostumieres).
The play affords a series of beau
tiful picturesparticularly in Act 
III, scenes 2 and 3 and. as always, 
the brush of Mr. J. Woodman 
Thompson was instrumental in af
fording the appropriate settings. 
Here on takes occasion to call at
tention to the new drop curtain, 
used first in the production of Rich
ard II, also the work of Mr. Thomp 
son. It is a wonderful tapestry ef
fectrich in color and rmarkable 
in designgiving equal effects in 
[either full or half lights. Its border 
I is worthy of an Oriental loom. It 
I is really an achievement on the part 
. of Mr. Thompson and calls forth ex
clamations of admiration from all 
j beholders.
I In this production, Miss Barton

Paul Slatek Proves Ability in 
Matinee Performance
The last program ofthe-.Friday 
Matinee Concerts was presented on 
May 25. in the theater of the School 
of Applied Design, before an appre
ciative audience.
The opening numberfirst move
ment of Haydens String Quartet 
Op. 64, No. 5 (Miss Manor, Messrs. 
Brown, Bellingham and Replogle), 
had all the artistic qualities that 
the public has learned to expect 
from this ensemblesureness of at
tack, clean tone and intelligent 
phrasing.
Miss Florence Warren played Mo
zarts piano -sonata in B flat No. 
11. She gave it a frank and literal 
interpretation and displayed a facile 
technique. It was a very creditable 
first . performance.
Miss Jean Wessnera new name 
proved her right to a place on the 
program by her remarkable artistic 
interpretation of the two cello num
bers Poppers Devotion, and the 
Scherzo, by Van Goens. She plays 
with . ease and elicits a rich and 
beautiful tone, \tiiich brought out 
fully the emotional content of the 
Popper number, which goes far to 
confirm Krelibills fanciful name for 
this.. rich toned instrumentthe 
sighing lover of the orchestra. 
As a counter-foil nothing could have 
been more appropriate than the 
Scherzo which she played with such 
dash and skill. Miss Wessner has, 
undoubtedly, a musical future.
The piece de resistence, was the 
First movement of Violin Concerto 
in D Op. 35 Tschaikovslci, played 
by Paul Slatek, who will be recalled 
as ha.ving done some very wonderful 
playing two years ago. This per
formance more than fufilled that 
early promise: he is, beyond ques
tion, one of the musically elect. The 
tremendous difficulties of this wond
erful composition are quite within 
his grasp and his interpretation of 
its musical content far beyond his 
years. It was a delightful and trill
ing performance.
Mr. Morton Rosenthal played a 
group of four piano numbers. The 
Schuman Tocatta and Chopin 
Etude, Op. 25 No. 10were the 
most interesting, the playing was 
virile and the tone clean. H^ suc
ceeded in getting considearable out 
of Debussys Iiefiets dans leau, 
and made a very favorable impres
sion on his audience.
The "closing number Nvas Dubois's 
Marche Heroique de Jeanne dArc 
for organ played by Mr. Herbert 
Schmidt another new comer who 
gave a verV good account of himself 
in this performance which was in
teresting throughout. This was one 
of the most brilliant and interesting 
programs of the series which will 
conclude with an ensemble program 
for wood-wind instruments on Sun
day evening at 8 oclock.

Unique Duet Featured Tues
days Offering
The Sunday evening recital of 
May 27, was of chamber music en: 
semble with wood winds. The first! 
number, Beethoven's Serenade in D 
major, Op 25 for flute, violin and 
viola, was given by Frohman Fos
ter. Dorothy Manor and Holland1 S. 
Bellingham, and except for a slip on 
on the part of the viola, which did 
not materially affect the rendition, 
was very well done.
A rather unique feature of the 
program was a duet for clarinet and 
bassoon. (Beethoven Op. 147) by 
LaVerne E. Irvine and R. A. VanWye. Both men did very well.
The Bach Arioso for flute and 
piano was well given by Heber Shaw 
and Louise Hepp. Samuel Wagner, 
V. Belehard and Helen Eyles de
serve special mention for their rendi
tion of Klugliardts Trio. Op. 2S for 
oboe, viola and piano. All three 
showed themselves quite at home 
with their instruments, blending the 
difficult chords perfectly.
Sando Amato and Adele Henig 
gave a very good interpretation of 
Brahm's Sonata in F minor, Op.121, 
for clarinet and piano. The last 
number on the program was Mozarts 
Quintet in C minor, Kochel 617, Op. 
20 for piano, flute, oboe, viola, and 
cello. The performers were: Ethel 
Shuman, Frohman Foster, Samuel 
Wagner, Alfred Ivreuger and Alix 
Einert. The composition is a diffi
cult one and the performers deserve 
credit for their splendid rendition 
of it.

That the work and possibilities of 
the Senate might become better 
known to Science men it was voted 
to publish a thousand booklets con
taining the constitution, by-laws, etc., 
for distribution to Science men at the

It was also decided that the best 
interests of the school would be 
furthered by having the Senate take 
charge of the selling of Plobe hats 
in the future, and the matter was 
put in charge of the Plebe Regula
tion Committee.
PRESIDENT ORR OFFERS
SENATE SUGGESTIONS
(Continued From Page One. 
sembly of the Science School 
throughout the second semester. 
This can be arranged for if the 
Dean is seen early in the first semes
ter.
2. An Honor System should be 
introduced as soon as possible. The 
Senate has plenary powers in this 
connection.
3. Plebe regulations should be 
rigidly enforced from the beginning 
Make the Plebes get the habit.
4. It will be proper time next 
year for the Faculty to recognize 
and determine the status of the 
Senate. It will have shown its 
power by that time.
5. We should keep in closer 
touch with oue Alumni. The im
provement and reputation of our 
school depends on this. An alumni 
smoker might well be given each 
year.
6. Class elections should be 
standardized. Classes on graduating 
or even throughout their course, 
should keep statistics. The Senate 
could evolve an ideal constitution 
for use in school and as alumni, arid 
require each entering class to adopt 
it.
7. Night School should not be 
included in the Senate. The interest 
of the Night men is not primarily 
|n school.
With very best regards, I am 
Yours very truly,
T. E. ORR.
According to the constitution a 
new secretary and treasurer should 
be elected at this time but due to 
the abnormal condition of the times 
but two men are eligible for the of
fices, and it was therefore, decided to 
postpone the election this year until 
fall, it being understood, however, 
that this action should not be taken 
as a * precedent upon which future 
postponements might be based. Since

profitably the time of the students 
and the Institutional plant, force, 
and equipment. With this end in 
view, wo suggest that, as an emer
gency measure, the colleges con
sider the advisability of dividing 
the college year into four quarters 
of approximately :L2 weeks each, 
and that, whore necessary, courses 
bo repeated at least once a year so 
that the college course may bo best 
adapted to the needs of food produc
tion.
We bollve, third, that In viow of 
the supreme importance of applied 
science in the present war, students 
pursuing technical courses, such as 
medicine, agriculture, and engineer 
Ing, are ronderingfar are to rendor, 
through the continuance of their 
training, services more valuable and 
efficient than if they were to enroll 
In military or naval service at once.
We believe, fourth, that the Gov
ernment should provide or encour
age military training for all young 
men in college by retired officers 
of the Army and National Guard 
or by other persons competent to 
give military instruction and that 
the colleges should include as a part 
of their course of study, teaching in 
military science, in accordance with 
the provisions of the national defense 
act of June, 1916.
We believe, fifth, that the Bureau 
of Education of the Department of 
the Interior and the States Relations 
Service of the Department of Agri
culture, with the cooperation of the 
committee on science, engineering, 
.and education of the advisory com
mission of the Council of National 
Defense, should be the medium of 
communication between the Federal 
departments and the higher educa
tional Institutions of the country.
Finally, we believe that an educa
tional responsibility rests on the in
stitutions of higher learning to dis
seminate correct information con
cerning the issues involved in the 
war and to interpret its meaning.

TECH TEAM LOSES TO PITT IN DUAL MEET
Tecli was returned the loser in the 
annual dual meet with Pitt at. the 
Schenley oval Friday, May 18. Pitt 
scored 02 points to our 34, No new 
records were hung up because of the 
stiff breeze the men had to work in.
in the 100 yard and 20 yard dash, 
Burwell of Pitt, took the honors with 
De Hart second. In the 220, De 
Hart was forced to the limit to beat 
out Lingenfelser of Tech. Llngenfelser is one of the speediest run
ners in the school and if he could 
get a little faster start, would make
a name for himself. Tech annexed 
second and third places in the two 
mile race. It. was one of the prettiest, 
races of the day. The last few yards 
decided the winner, Kosslor of Tech, 
just nosing out Lawson for second 
place.
Tech got two first places, one in 
the shot pul and one in the broad 
jump. Ellerton beat. Sutherland of 
Pitt, in the shot put and Brommer 
took the broad jump. The absence 
of Iiaub, who sprained an ankle the 
preceding Saturday handicapped 
Tecli in the high juitiip. The sum

PLAID NET MEN LOOSE 
TO PITT DACOUETEDS
Davis and Steen Up To Form. 
Beatty Plays In Spite 
Of Bad Eyes]
Much to the surprise of their loyal 
adherents Carnegie racqueters lost 
their tennis tournament with the 
Pitt net men 4. to 2. In view of the 
fact that Penn State, who had de
feated Pitt 4 to 2, broke even with 
Tech, Harry Seymour and other crit
ics had picked the Plaid men to 
win.
John Beatty, Techs number one 
man had a bad case of pink eye, but 
nevertheless played in spite of it. 
The first set between Jack and Mohn 
was very Interesting, with Jack 
lending at 5 to 2, playing his best 
tennis of the season. Then Ills oyos 
began to fail him and he became 
wild, sometimes missing the ball en
tirely, Mohn played a steady bril
liant game all the way.
Captain Davis lost two fast sots to 
Splndlor. A strong wind bothered 
the two players considerably. In 
the Pitt tournament last year Toots 
defeated Spindler.
Turk Steen played his usual

was the only man to win his single 
match.
Kossler forced Islierwood to play 
three sets before he lost.
In the doubles matches, Davis and 
Beatty showed a complete reversal 
of form winning both sets from 
Spindler and Mohn In an easy fash
ion.
RESULTS:
Singles:
Beatty-Mohn, 7-0, 2-0; DavlsSpinidlor, 0-8, 4-0; Kosslor-Isherwood,

But one more match remains; the 
return match with Pitt away, sched

withstanding their recent defeat, the 
Plaid netmen are confident that they 
will defeat the Pitt net men.
