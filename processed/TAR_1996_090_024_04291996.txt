UC construction nears completionOpening ceremonies will be held in August
By TOMMY CHEUNG
Tartan Staffwriter
There are only 111 days remaining 
on the calendar before August 28,1996. 
On that day, the much-anticipated 
official opening celebration for the new 
multi-purpose University Center will 
take place.
Steven Calvert, assistant vice presi
dent for development and director of 
alumni relations, believes the build
ing itself will increase interest in the 
University.
He said, I think the most interest
ing thing about this building is the 
effect it has on people when they see it. 
This includes the staff and alumni. It 
also has an enormous impact on stu
dents who are applying.
The towering University Center con
sists of three floors and a basement. It 
will be the new home for existing ser
vices such as the Art Store, University 
Shoppe, and Entropy, as well as student 
activities offices. It will also be high
lighted by a fully functional ballroom, a 
450-seat auditorium and new athletic 
facilities which will include a 48,600- 
gallon pool, and racquetball courts.
Jill Goodall, a senior psychology 
major and intern in the office of spe
cial events, thinks the building will 
help student interaction. The student 
organization office space should bring 
students together more than they have 
been in the past, she said.
With most of the construction com
pleted, a great deal of the remaining 
work consists of safety tests and work 
inside the building, which will take a 
few-months to finish.
Andrew McDermott/Tartan Managing Editor
The future site of the University Shoppe is on the first floor of the University Center 
next to Entropy. The official opening celebration for the UC will be August 28.
Thomas Murphy, project manager for 
the University Center said, We are 
probably 97 percent complete right now. 
The remaining three [percent] include 
things like moving in furniture and 
testing the fire alarms, and will take a 
long time to finish out. So its a very 
long, slow process to clean out the last 
three [percent].
The construction of the massive build
ing has been right on schedule with few
interruptions.
Joe Greenaw'ay, construction man
ager said, Everything went hunkydory ... like socks on a rooster.:. theyre 
really hard to get on, but once they get 
on, they fit really tight.
One of the few problems encoun
tered during construction was the con
stant weather changes.

GSIA names new dean
By JENNY GARCIA 
de OSUNA
Tartan Assistant Forum Editor
I am truly excited to be part of such an 
outstanding institution that has 
strengths in research and commitment 
to excellence, said Douglas Dunn about 
his upcoming duties. Beginning July 15, 
Dunn will assume the position of dean of 
Carnegie Mellons Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration (GSIA).
As dean of GSIA, Dunn has two imme
diate goals: to leverage his strengths in 
communication to the school and to cre
ate an ongoing relationship with the 
alumni. He believes that the magnitude 
of skills and great interests of the fac
ulty, staff, students, and alumni have 
resulted in extensive contributions to 
business and society.
I believe the future of business educa
tion will build upon quantitative meth
ods and the convergence of information 
technologies applied to business prob
lems, said Dunn. Further, I believe 
Carnegie Mellon is uniquely positioned 
to help firms be successful in the in
creasingly competitive and global fu
ture business environment.
Dunn believes that fundamental 
changes in telecommunication regula
tion and technology will alter the way 
companies think about information.
Carnegie Mellon has the capacity to 
make path-breaking contributions to 
shape policy and to help companies gain 
competitive advantage by leveraging the 
strengths of GSIA, Computer Science, 
Statistics, Engineering, and Public 
Policy, said Dunn.
Im excited to see what he will do to 
promote GSIA to the public at large and 
to leverage the strengths in technology 
and quantitative skills, said senior In
dustrial Management (IM) major Steve 
Woyicki.
The administration is looking forward 
to increased developments in GSIA. They 
pointed out that total CMU academic 
applications are over 14,000 for a class 
size of1,250, highlightedby undergradu
ate IM applications which have risen 50 
percent. The IM program is ranked third 
and graduate program is rankedl 4th in 
the nation by U.S. News and World 
Report.
For Dunn, however, the focus is on the 
program and the students. I view the 
students as the customer. We need to 
find ways to help the students, he said. 
He believes that the students and the 
organizations well-being goes hand in 
hand. What Id like to do is have a good 
open relationship with the students, he 
said.
Students are anticipating possible 
changes in the department with Dunns 
jurisdiction.
As an undergrad, I feel we need 
greater communication between the [IM] 
department and the deans office. There 
needs to be more interest placed in the 
undergraduate program, as part of 
GSIA, said Woyicki. I think that alumni 
tend to pay more attention to their gradu
ate school than their undergraduate. 
The institutions should be more inter
ested in the undergraduates and realize 
that we are going to be big donors later 
on, too. So, I really look forward to see 
what Dunn has to offer.
Dunn, presently vice president of vi
sual communications and multimedia 
strategy at AT&T, has spent 26 years at 
the telecommunications company where 
his business talent extended to both the 
commercial sector and the research 
arena at Bell Laboratories.
While at AT&T, Dunn came up with a 
blend of strategies allowing market en
try into the competitive multimedia com
munications medium. A large part of

Department makes adjustments...
English becomes a new majorSenate allocates student fees
By SAVIT TEWARI
Tartan Staffwriter
The English department held a 
meeting last Friday to introduce 
a new English major. This pro
gram will combine the previous 
majors of literary and cultural 
studies (LCS) and rhetoric in or
der to give more options to the 
student, while at the same time 
making the department more ef
ficient. Even though the purpose 
of the meeting was to explain the 
new major and answer any wor
ries or questions that the stu
dents might have had, it was 
poorly attended.
The new major was approved by 
the college council last Thursday 
and will take effect next year. This 
is a healthy move for the department, said David Kufer, head of 
the English department. An En
glish major described the new pro
gram as, A combination of LCS 
and rhetoric, without the loss of 
either one.
There were several motivations 
to combine the separate LCS and 
rhetoric degrees. Kufer said, 
The average number of units 
required to graduate is about 90 
for a nonprofessional major in 
H&SS, while LCS and rhetoric 
require 144 and 135 units respec
tively, which makes it hard for a 
student to graduate. The En
glish BA will require 90 units [in 
the English department] to 
graduate. The department hopes 
that this change will attract more 
English majors  not only from 
the college itself but also potential students from high schools.
Crystal Bartolovich, assistant 
professor of English said, Nei
ther one of these majors [LCS nor 
rhetoric] has attracted a large 
number of students. Peter 
Stearns, dean of H&SS said, I 
am happy with the change. LCS 
and rhetoric were needlessly di
vided. The new major will try to 
combine the two.
The LCS major examined not 
only traditional literary texts but 
also works by several authors from 
different periods and regions of 
the world. It also examined nonliterary texts such as television 
and advertising. Students learned 
the writing strategies and re
search skills needed to produce 
their own texts. The rhetoric maPlease see ENGLISH, page 5

Greek Advisor leaves position
By SHANNON GIBNEY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Janine Coppola, coordinator 
for Residence Life for Greek 
Affairs, has resigned from her 
position at CMU and accepted 
a similar one at the University 
of New Hampshire. Coppola 
said that Residence Life ad
ministrators are currently in 
the process of selecting some
one to fill her position for next 
year.
Coppola said she decided to 
take the position at the Univer
sity of New Hampshire because 
she wanted to work in a larger, 
public school, live in the coun
try, and expand her profes
sional experience.
Coppola was appointed Coordi
nator for Residence Life for Greek 
Affairs in July 1994 and will leave 
the University later this June. 
This position was created when 
Coppola applied for it.
I was excited [to apply] be
cause the position was so new 
and it seemed like there was a lot 
of growth in the Residence Life 
office and in Student Affairs, 
said Coppola. She added that she 
believes that, although there have 
been ups and downs, overall the 
Greek community has benefited 
from the establishment of a coor
dinator.
I think in a lot of ways the 
students were excited to have 
someone who was able to devote 
a lot of their time to the Greek
system as I have.... In the past, 
very small percentages of a 
persons responsibilities were 
devoted to Greek affairs. So I 
think thats a huge benefit to 
the students  that theyVe 
been given a lot more support 
and attention, said Coppola.
She added, I think in a lot of 
ways thats been a shock to the 
Greek system, because theyre 
like Oh my God, why is some
one addressing these issues for 
the first time, and weve al
ways done it this way? So I can 
see both sides about how stu
dents have been taken aback 
by all the attention.

Student Senate met last Tues
day to approve the proposed sub
sidies to student organizations, 
settle contested budgets, and 
make transition money available 
for organizations.
Senate voted 7-2 against a 
new computer to help The Stu
dent Unions pro_________
duction of a higherquality newspaper, 
but gave them 
money for RAM in 
their existing com
puter. Senior IM 
major and Program 
Manager for the paper, Tatsuhiro __________
Ikeda spoke on their 
behalf. The Student 
Union is supposed to provide a 
very important service to the com
munity. [It is] important if you 
want students to feel they can 
experiment in the public light. 
Ikeda, who has served on Senates 
Funding and Recognition (F&R) 
committee, said that The Stu
dent Union presented a detailed 
three-page budget, including a 
choice of computers. We made it 
as easy for them as. possible, and 
still they rejected us, Ikeda said.
We dont think theres any mal
ice involved, but at the very least if s 
poor communication, Ikeda said, 
adding that the committee never 
let [The Student Union] know what 
was up.... Basically, the F&R com
mittee has not done a good job.
Ikeda added, They are 
overloaded with work, and 
it was hard to get hold of 
the [F&R] chair.
The F&R Chair jun
ior ECE major Brian 
Mueller, was unavail
able for comment.
A lot of the bad vibes that 
circulated about him [Mueller] 
were off-base. Hes always been 
even with WRCT, hes a very 
organized and hard-working in
dividual. I really dont have any 
bad things to say about him, 
said senior chemistry major Dave 
Hackney, who recently finished 
his term as WRCT general manWe made it as easy for them 
as possible, but still they re
jected us..."
 Tatsuhiro Ikeda, Program 
Manager of The Student Union
ager. They [F&R] were unfortu
nately understaffed, and they did 
an adequate job with the re
sources that they had.
Senate approved WRCTs tran
sition fund of $33,769.98 required 
for the wiring, soundproofing, and 
storage racks needed in the new 
University Center.
In addition, WRCT asked for a 
$1,000 emergency fund, but Sen
ate ended up giving the radio sta
tion only a $500 emergency allo
cation. Hackney believes that part 
of the reason they did not get the 
full $1,000 had to do with the 
name. Unforeseen expenditures 
would probably work better, said 
Hackney. Pretty much everyone 
I talked to thinks WRCT budgets
are better than any other group. 
We budget down to individual 
pairs of scissors ... and by label
ing it as an emergency fund 
makes it seem like money thats 
just being given to the radio sta
tion.... Its the money which we 
spend as things break to have 
them fixed.
Then-Senate Chair Brenden 
Mielke, a sophomore IM major 
and then-Public Relations Chair 
Michael Rosenthal, a junior CS 
major, tried to hammer out a lastminute plan to have the total 
$1,000 available to them, but were 
unable to because of an agreementthat WRCT signedlast year.
The agreement states 
that at the end of the 
year any money 
WRCT has left over 
must go towards their 
$25,000 antenna 
debt. Additionally, 
WRCT must pay off 
at least $5,000 to
wards this debt each 
TaaaTrtT year.
Senate also alloted 
$1,300 to WRCT for new loud
speakers that will help in 
fundraising.
Greek Council filed an applica
tion for the first time and was 
granted a $500 subsidy for their 
$1,000 budget. The money will be 
spent for a band, advertising for 
Greek Sing, a blood drive, and 
other charity events that arent 
specific to Greeks.
We realize that this is Senates 
money, and were trying to do 
stuff thats helpful to the whole 
campus, said junior ECE major 
Jeff Polega, Greek Council presi
dent.
All other uncontested subsidies 
for student organizations were 
approved by Senate.

Everyone claims victory as 
Washington passes budget
WASHINGTON April 26, (AP)  
Ending months of partisan struggle 
marked by two partial government 
shutdowns, President Clinton signed 
the final 1996 federal spending bill 
into law today.
Republicans and Democrats, mean
while, agree on two things about the 
massive spending bill closing out their 
1996 budget battle: It marks a great 
bipartisan achievement and it proves 
that theyand not the other guys  
should be re-elected.
With broad support from both par
ties, on Thursday the Senate voted 
88-11 and the House 399-25 to ap
prove the $159 billion measure financ
ing nine Cabinet-level departments 
and dozens of agencies for the five 
months left in fiscal year 1996.
Even before Congress finished with 
the bill, Clinton appeared in the White 
House briefing room to laud it as a real 
victory for progress over partisanship.
The American people ... know that
I cannot claim full credit for a bill that 
goes through a Congress that is ma
jority Republican, said Clinton, whos 
running for re-election as the kind of 
Democrat who can work well with 
Republicans but at the same time curb 
their excesses.
Clinton also signed waivers, autho
rized by the legislation, nullifying the 
effect of attachments to the bill that 
he said would have a harmful impact 
on the environment.
Republicans claimed a win because 
the bill is the culmination of a 1996 
budget process that saved $20 billion, 
according to Congressional Budget Of
fice figures.
But Democrats said they forced Re
publicans to reorder spending priori
ties to provide more money for educa
tion, environmental protection, job 
training, and other domestic pro
grams.
Republicans also retreated on vari
ous environmental provisions at
tached to the bill that would have, 
among other things, permitted more 
logging in the Tongass National For
est in Alaska and ended EPA regula
tion of wetlands development.
However, Democrats lost their fights 
oh language cutting funds for foreign 
family planning services and allow
ing hospitals to refuse to teach abor
tion to medical students.
Everybody got something and ev
erybody gave something, said Sen
ate Appropriations Committee 
Chairman Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., a 
mild-mannered veteran lawmaker 
who rarely engages in partisan at
tacks.
But not everyone was so judicious.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, RGa., called it a remarkable achieve
ment given that we have a liberal 
president trying to get more spending 
and trying to get more bureaucracy.
Rome wasnt built in a day and 
getting the perfect budget will take 
more than one term in the majority, 
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, RTexas said.
Minority Leader Tom Daschle of 
South Dakota said Americans will 
remember that Congress passed its 
last spending bill ofl996 seven months 
into the fiscal year and only after two 
partial government shutdowns total
ing 27 days.
Its not the right way to govern. It 
is, in my view, the metaphor for the 
Republican Congress, Daschle said.

Israel continues to fight terrorists
KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel, April 25, 
(AP)On a typical day, 17 children eat 
lunch in the room where a Katyusha 
rocket fell Thursday, scattering chunks 
of concrete and shreds of paper stream
ers with the force of its explosion.
For Israelis, the gaping hole in the roof 
of a day-care center is proof enough of 
the threat they face from Hezbollah guer
rillas in Lebanonand the reason they 
have gone to war.
Israel has lost much of the worlds sup
port for its military offensive as the num
ber of civilian casualties has mounted. 
Sympathy plummeted after at least 91 
refugees died in Israels shelling ofaUnited 
Nations base in south Lebanon.
But Israelis say they wont wait for a 
roomful of children to die before they 
fight back against Hezbollah  regard
less of what the world thinks.
Id rather no one be killed and be 
unpopular, Yair Doari, who lives on a 
kibbutz near Israels northern border, 
said with a shrug.
Israel blames Hezbollah guerrillas for 
the heavy civilian toll, accusing them of 
firing on Israel from inside Lebanese 
villages and using civilians as shields.
They dont care about the suffering of 
the Lebanese, said government spokes
man Uri Dromi. Israel has the right to 
defend itself. It will take all action nec
essary to remove this ongoing threat of 
Katyushas.
More than two-thirds of the 23,000 
residents have left Kiryat Shemona, the 
largest town along the border, and the 
rest spend most of their time in under
ground shelters.
The fact that there are not so many 
casualties in the north is simply because 
people had to leave after being terror
ized by the Katyushas, Dromi said. If 
there had been children in the center it 
would have been a huge tragedy.
The day-care center where the 
Katyusha struck Thursday has been 
abandoned since the offensive began. 
But on normal days, 17 children aged 7 
to 14 come to the center for hot meals 
and for help with their homework, said 
teacher Limor Sobel, peering through 
the shattered windows after Thursdays 
devastation.
A grid of reinforcing rods kept the 
centers roof from collapsing completely. 
But chunks of concrete and plaster cov
ered the floor, and the sun shone brightly 
through the 9-by-9-foot hole ripped in 
the ceiling.
Children here live all the time fear
ing that something like that can hap
pen, Sobel said. Every day they wake 
up feeling that bombs can fall.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres says he 
wont accept a cease-fire unless guerrillas 
stop firing the Katyusha rockets for good 
a position widely supported by Israelis.
I want all the people that say they 
want Israel to stop to come here to Kiryat
Shemona and live here a week or two 
under the Katyushas, said Igal Levi, 
30, who lives across the street from the 
day-care center. He had just come out of 
his underground shelter for some fresh 
air Thursday when the rocket hit, shat
tering the windows in his apartment.
According to Israeli government fig
ures, 450 Katyushas fired from Lebanon 
landed in Israel, killing 34 people, from 
1968 until the current round of fighting 
began two weeks ago. Since then, an
other 500 rockets have landed in Israel.
We have to finish this, said Levi, 
who works in a paper factory.
He said he is sorry about the suffering 
the operation is causing Lebanese civil
ians.
But we are civilians, too. We dont 
have any choice, he said. We didnt ask 
for this war. If they live in quiet, we live 
in quiet. All we fight now is for peace.
Superman curse claims Lois Lane
April 25, (AP)The Superman Curse 
appears to have struck Margot Kidder, 
the actress who played Lois Lane in the
_______________ Superman
movies.
^P||L........Kidder
a psychiatric 
ward Tuesday after she 
was found 
wandering
disheveled and disoriented through a 
back yard in suburban Los Angeles. Au
thorities found no evidence of foul play.
Her Superman co-star, Christopher 
Reeve, was left paratyzed and unable to 
breathe on his own after a riding acci
dent last May.
The first Superman movie with 
Reeve and Kidder came out in 1978 and 
was followed by three successful se
quels.
George Reeves, who starred in the 
1951 movie Superman and the Mole 
Men and did 104 episodes of TVs The 
Adventures of Superman from 1951 to 
1957, died of a gunshot wound to the 
head in 1959.
Police ruled Reeves death a suicide, 
but his mother believed he was mur
dered. There were reports at the time 
that the actor was despondent about the 
end of his Superman run.
Kirk Alyn, the first live-action Super
man, bitterly complained that he had 
been typecast and couldnt get another 
movie role after the movie serials that 
ran from 1948 to 1950. Now 85, he has 
Alzheimers disease and was last re
ported living in Texas.
Richard Pryor, who has multiple scle
rosis, says hes been in touch with Kid
der, who has helped him financially. In 
Superman III, Pryor played Gus 
Gorman, a dishwasher-tumed-computer 
mastermind who tries to thwart the Man 
of Steel.
Governor targets women smokers
TALLAHASSEE,Fla.,April26,(AP) ' 
Capitalizing on Thursdays annual Take 
Our Daughters to WorkDay, Gov. Lawton 
Chiles took his battle against tobacco to 
those most susceptible to cigarette adver
tising  young women.
Tobacco has a history of using too 
many images of healthy and happy young 
people, young women, to lure the rest of 
usespecially young teensinto their 
deadly trap, Chiles said.
Smoking is not a woman thing, its a 
death thing, Chiles told a roomful of 
schoolgirls at the Capitol with their 
mothers and fathers. Its a death trap. 
Dont let them fool you. It kills!
As the 1996 legislature heads toward 
its scheduledMay 3 adjournment, Chiles 
still fears a last-minute effort from to
bacco lobbyists hoping to repeal a 1994 
law the state is using to sue tobacco 
companies.
The state is trying to recoup $1.4 
billion toward the costs of treating sick 
smokers covered by the governments 
Medicaid health program.
I would say that sooner or later were 
going to do another (veto) override, 
Philip Morris lobbyist John French said 
earlier this week. Its fairly inevitable. 
But Chiles has kept the heat on law
makers all session to sustain his position. 
After last years session, Chiles vetoed a 
bill to repeal the law, and now tobacco 
lobbyists are trying to persuade lawmak
ers to override the governors veto.
The governor enlisted the moving tes
timonial of a former model whose can
cerous voice box and part of a lung were 
removed after 33 years of smoking.
Its a bad thing, dont do it, Janet 
Sackman, a former Miss Chesterfield 
and model for Lucky Strike, whispered 
to about 20 students. Sackman began 
modeling for the cigarette companies in 
the 1940s when she was 17.
But she didnt smoke, a problem for 
her sponsors.
A tobacco executive ... said It would 
be a good idea for you to start smoking, 
she recounted. Youre an up-and-coming model and it would be good for you to 
know how to hold a cigarette, how to puff 
on a cigarette for the TV commercials. 
Thats a story youll never see in the 
cigarette ads, said Chiles, who smoked - 
briefly as a young man before quitting 
in law school. Its time for tobacco com
panies to stop targeting our kids and 
start paying for the damage, death, and 
destruction that theyre causing. 
Florida is one of seven states suing to 
get back some of the money spent by the 
state to treat sick smokers. It is the only . 
state with a law that gives the governI 
ment an edge in the courts.
The governor already has thwarted an :' 
earlier attempt in the Senate to override ' 
his veto. He needs 14 votes in the 40- - 
member Senate to prevail. He appar.} 
ently had at least 16 votes last month.

50 YEARS AGO, April 30, 
1946: Carnegie Tech campus 
prepared for Carnival, which 
was held May 3 and 4 that year. 
The booth competition was held 
in tents and a Ferris wheel and 
miniature train were placed on 
the Cut.
The Sweepstakes races began 
Friday at 4:30 pm and Scotch 
N Soda gave a performance in 
the gym. On Saturday, the foot
ball squad had a practice game, 
and immediately following the 
game was the coronation of the

proceeded at 2:30 in the after

with a semi-formal dance at 9:00 
pm., and many fraternities 
planned breakfasts for after the 
dances.

Morewood Gardens.
Two male assailants entered a 
room and then assualted, bound, 
gagged, and blind-folded a stu

former CMU student, then spent 
20 to 30 minutes ransacking the 
room.
Meanwhile, two students in
formed the A-Tower desk atten

on the seventh floor of E-Tower. 
The desk attendant immediately 
alerted security, who arrived on 
the scene before the robbers had 
left.
The robbers indicated that the

tion that students here possess 
quantities of drugs.
10 YEARS AGO, April 29, 
1986: The Student Senate Cam
pus Affairs Committee addressed 
traffic problems at four intersec
tions at CMU.
It was found that five people
were struck by cars in general 
pedestrian areas between Janu
ary 1985 and January 1986. Also, 
cars frequently exceeded the 
Morewood and Forbes speed limit 
of 25 mph.
In crosswalks, the walk signal 
was found to stay lit for only six 
seconds, and after 11 pm the sig
nal did not light at all unless the 
manual control button was 
pushed. The committee recom
mended that pedestrian walk
time percentage be increased 
during peak student crossing 
hours.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 29, 
1991: Then-junior IM maj or Hyun 
Shin was elected student body
president.
Shin won a five-way race by 
gathering 520 votes, twice as 
many as his nearest competitor. 
1,300 people showed up to vote 
(over four times this years turn
out) representing 21 percent of 
those eligible.
Among Shins goals were to es\ 
tablish a student mentor program * 
to pair up incoming freshmen t 
with sophomores and juniors,  
hold a faculty-student open house 
to promote interaction between \ 
students and faculty, and to set 
up a steering committee to keep 
the campus informed.

His knowledge of the business world 
and his understanding of how univer

maintain strongrelationships with the 
corporate community, locally, nation

and business stems from his academic 
degrees in physics, industrial man
agement, and business statistics from 
the University of Michigan and Geor

Crime and Incident Report
By KENNETH J. KRAEMER
Tartan Editor-inChief
Umbilical-Cord Fred, Mickey Mouse, 
and Nostradamus all have something in 
common  each received votes for posi
tions in Carnegie Mellons Student Gov
ernment in elections held during Carni
val.
Despite the annual calls to service for 
cartoon characters, the Bryon Krug and 
Katie Hart ticket was elected to the 
executive offices of president and vice 
president, respectively, by a landslide 
margin.
With 222 of405 votes cast, roughly 55 
percent, the Krug/Hart ticket swept the 
election. Michael Rosenthal carried 23 
percent of the votes, while Mike Szudarek 
garnered 13 percent of the vote. 
Unattributed votes went to write-in can
didates and, yes, comic-page stars.
The Krug/Hart tickets margin over 
Rosenthal was 22 percent. I think it 
shows people really believe in what Katie 
and I want to work on, said Krug, a 
sophomore electrical and computer en
gineering major.
Im really excited about working with 
other student groups to get things done, 
said Krug, describing his ambitions for 
next year.
Krug wants to develop relationships 
with the administration and student 
leaders, in order to make decisions that 
are better for each of the three groups
 students, faculty, and administra
tion.
Student Government started to make 
progress this semester... said Krug. It
should make real gains next year. I 
think it needs more publicity.
Krugs was the only ticket that had 
both a candidate for president and vice 
president, as recent Senate legislation 
allows; a March 12 amendment to the 
Senate bylaws created the vice presi
dent position.
I think it helped, said Krug. I hope 
people were voting [for Krug and Hart] 
because they thought Katie and I could 
handle the positions, and I think they 
were.
Im hoping that the other presiden
tial candidates will want to work on the 
things they said, even though they didnt 
win, he said, citing that many ideas 
came out of the race.
Election-day participation continued 
to follow the downward trend observed 
over the past few years. This years elec
tion saw a turnout of405 students, while 
6,921 were eligible. This reflects a 5.85 
percent turnout, a decrease from last 
years participation.
Things need to be looked at, said 
Brenden Mielke, sophomore industrial 
management major and Chair of the 
Student Senate at the time of the elec
tions. Although Mielke pointed out that 
5.8 percent is the average turnout for 
student government elections, he attrib
uted the turnout to problems in public
ity.
Publicity [was] less than I wouldve 
expected, said Mielke. I think it has 
something to do with the PR [Public 
Relations] chair [Michael Rosenthal] 
being a very busy gentleman.
The turnout observed this year is a
decrease from last years 6.5 percent  
turnout, a .65 percent decrease. The ' 
1994 elections had a 12.2 percent turn4 
out.
Brian Mueller, the 1995-96 Chair of : 
the Student Senate Funding and Recog; 
nition committee, ran unopposed for the 
office of treasurer. Mueller, a junior 
electrical and computer engineering 
major, recently came under fire for some 
decisions made by the F&R committee 
during the 1996 budget allocation and 
appeal process. [Ed. note: Please see re
lated story, page 1 ]
Mueller said, We do our best to be fair 
with everybody.... I could see where 
people get upset with things, but it comes 
with the territory [sic].
Seats for next years Student Senate 
were filled as well, with candidates re
ceiving seats with as few as one or two 
votes.
Senators were able to win on very few 
votes, [which is] not necessarily repre
sentative of the campus, said Mielke.
The elections were contested at last 
weeks Student Senate meeting by 
then-Public Relations Chair and expresidential candidate Michael 
Rosenthal. Rosenthal suggested that 
the elections be extended-throughout 
this past week (April 22 to April 26) so 
that a greater number of students 
would participate.
The primary reason [for the motion] 
was that people didnt know know where 
the tables were, said Rosenthal.
The motion by Rosenthal failed in the 
eyes of the chair, and the Senate ratified 
the elections by acclamation.UC construction nears completion
4/19 INTOXICATED PER
SON, 4:03 am. Campus Police 
received a call that there was an

squeeze bottle and found it con
tained amixed drink that smelled 
heavily of an intoxicating bever
age. The actor was issued a cita
tion for outside alcohol.
4/21 POSSESSION/MARI
JUANA, 4:53 am. While on pa
trol, officers noticed people drink
ing and a lighter flash. While the 
officers approached and explained 
the University Alcohol Policy, a 
strong smell of marijuana began 
permeating the air. An officer 
found a marijuana cigarette about 
1/2 inch in diameter, still burning, 
at the feet of one of the actors. The 
officers informed the actors that 
they were technically under ar
rest and subject to a pat-down 
search. The search revealed ciga
rette papers on two of the actors 
and a plastic zip lock baggie con
taining green vegetable matter on 
one of them. The two actors found 
with contraband were issued cita
tions and the actors not found to
have contraband were warned 
and released.
4/21 MEDICAL CALL, 4:20 
pm. An officer and student EMS 
were dispatched to the Mid

ported damage done to their 
vehicle parked in the garage. 
The victim showed a dent on 
the hood of the car. It appeared 
as if someone had tried to pry 
the hood open. Its unknown if 
someone was trying to gain 
entry to the engine or if it was 
an act of vandalism.

CONSTRUCTION, from page 1
pletely contingent on the weather 
conditions, butyou work aroundit. 
If we have to work some evenings 
and Saturdays to make it up, well 
do it.... Day to day you make ad
justments, but the overall plan and 
scheme have been consistent. 
Murphy also points to a change 
in decision to the construction 
process, which helped avoid prob
lems with the weather.
He said, Probably early on, 
the decision to erect part of the 
steel structure knowing wed have 
to stop the operation [in the win
ter] and put it off to a later date 
was the best decision we made 
because we were here in Decem
ber erecting steel, and then we 
were able to come back in Febru
ary and start the brick work.
In addition, the construction 
team had to prove that no dam
age was done to the citys sewer 
line, because the University Cen
ter is built above it. The city sent 
a diver through the sewer to check 
for problems, according to 
Murphy.
As the opening of the Univer
sity Center nears, full-scale pro
motions have begun. During 
Spring Carnival, water bottles 
and brochures were handed out, 
and hard-hat tours of the center 
are being conducted now and 
throughout the summer.
Maryann Moore, director of 
special events said, We are of
fering tours on a limited basis, 
and it is a hard-hat facility now.... 
Its to my understanding that the 
hours have been booked solid 
throughout the month of April, 
but we are training a large group 
of volunteers across campus to 
give tours throughout the sum
mer and into the fall.
Patricia Stacer, director of re
tail services said, Weve been
working with Maryann [Moore] 
and special events, and were try
ing to procure some freebies and 
events with giveaways and pro
motions.
The celebrations for the new 
building will continue through 
most of the next academic year, as 
the first two weeks will be filled 
with activities. Events such as 
Homecoming and the Interna
tional Festival will also be cel
ebrated in the University Center.
Moore said, I believe the build
ing will take on a life of its own  
just because of the opportunities  
there with retail, dining, and the 
auditorium. You can do anything 
in the building. Our goal is to use 
the space to its maximum. We 
dont want the facility empty.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  29 April 1996
H&SS announces new major
ENGLISH, from page 1
jor was a liberal arts degree that involved 
literature, history, philosophy, language, 
and linguistics. Students experienced and 
practiced several social approaches to 
the study of literate behavior. They also 
learned about reading and writing as 
cultural activities over several time peri
ods. The two programs combined will 
compose the new English major.
Another reason for this change is that 
more students may identify with an 
English major. Bartolovich said,  En
glish is simply a more familiar term. 
This change in name itself might be 
more comprehensible to people and at
tract more majors [in English]. Kaufer 
also said, As I talk to high school stu
dents who want to pursue a major in the 
English department, I find that both 
[the terms] LCS and rhetoric do not 
communicate well with them.
Kaufer said, There was also an under
utilization problem in the department. 
We had to change to become more effi
cient. We have about 90 majors and five 
faculty members for creative writing, pro
fessional writing also has about 90 ma
jors with one senior lecturer, while we 
have about 14 faculty members for 25 
majors in LCS and rhetoric. There is a 
resource problem that needs to be ad
dressed here.
This new change does not effect the 
students in the college at present. There 
will be a grandfather clause for students
who have already declared LCS or rheto
ric as a major, unless of course they choose 
to change their major, Bartolovich said.
This change, however will not be very 
apparent until a little later. In the short 
run, some of the faculty feel that things 
will go on pretty much the same way; 
however, in the long run, certain types of 
changes will happen simply because LCS 
is no longer a project, Bartolovich said. 
One of the things that having the major 
did was provide a sort of organizing struc
ture for a certain project within the de
partment; I think that by changing the 
rubric to English, the way is open for that 
focus to dissipate.
The English department previously 
offered LCS and a similar degree called 
literary and cultural theory (LCT) at 
the graduate level. I am personally a 
little sad. One of the things that made 
us unique was that we had a graduate 
and undergraduate program in LCS, 
said Bartolovich.
Some concern has been raised about the 
overall quality of the new major, now that 
it requires fewerunits to graduate. Kaufer 
said, It is important to realize that no 
area of study is being repudiated.
The new program is also expected to 
make the department more cohesive. 
Kaufer said, Part of having an English 
major is to tell the students that you all 
belong in the same department, without 
taking away the ability or opportunity of 
specialization.
CMU Greek Coordinator resigns
COPPOLA, from page 1
Panhellenic Council said, Speaking 
on behalf of sororities, I think for the 
most part Coppola interacts very well 
with the community.... Her position as 
advisor is essential to the entire Greek 
community since the advisor more or 
less acts as the liaison between the 
Greek community and the adminis
tration. This is crucial since much of 
the time it is misunderstanding be
tween the Greek community and the 
administration that has caused such a 
strained relationship.
Unfortunately, some of the Greek 
community will probably view Janines 
resignation as a good thing, only be
cause of the tough job she has had 
with enforcing University and frater
nity national policies and regulations, 
said Brendan Clarke, junior mechani
cal engineering major, and Interfra
ternity Council (IFC) President.
I think that the Greek community, 
though already full of pride and strength, 
is even still maturing. Greeks are begin
ning to understand that changes need 
to be made and that the position Janine 
has held ... is invaluable for guidance 
and support, Clarke added.
Coppola acknowledged that some 
fraternities have been less willing to 
work with her because of risk manage
ment issues like drinking.
Change is hard, change is definitely 
hard.... Its been hard to help the stu
dents to understand what things 
needed to be addressed. Weve tried to 
do a lot more education in the Greek 
system in the past two years [like] 
programs for the Greek community 
and the non-Greek community on alco
hol abuse.... Obviously, some unfortu
nate things have happened on this cam
pus in the past two years, and we hope 
that [they] never happen again, so we 
want to educate people so that they 
make good choices.
Coppola said that she believes that 
these programs will continue to be effec
tive once she has left CMU.
She said, I certainly see a value in 
students fraternity and sorority experi
ences, and how that can enhance their 
college experience, help them develop 
leadership skills and improve their aca
demic experience.... I believe in what 
fraternities and sororities are, why [they] 
were founded, and what brotherhood 
and sisterhood mean, and I want to help 
students at the collegiate level to see 
what Ive seen.... Thats really been my 
love.
Coppola added that there is clear evi
dence of the impact she has made on the 
Greek community at CMU.
She said, Im certainly going to leave 
here with some good feelings that the
Greek system has moved in a really 
positive direction in the time that Ive 
been here. Weve developed a lot of 
great programs such as the Greek peer 
advisor program, and the Greek judi
cial board, and I think weve really 
enhanced the leadership of the coun
cils and created some chapter unity 
among the fraternities and sororities.... 
I hope that the students and the per
son that follows me takes things to the 
next step [sic].
Coppola also said that the common 
perception that the administration 
wants to throw Greeks off campus is 
false, and that students should view 
administrators as a resource rather 
than as an enemy.
Tim Foster, director of Residence 
Life, announced his resignation last 
week; Coppola said that there was no 
connection between the two resigna
tions.
Entry-level positions in the field of 
student affairs normally have a one to 
four year turnover rate, as you can see 
by the turnover rate of previous Coor
dinators in the Residence Life Office.... 
[This office] has been a great place to 
work, said Coppola.
Coppolas supervisors, John Hannon, 
coordinator for Residence Life, and 
Foster, did not comment on her resig
nation.

Thistles and Thorns
As the school year speedily comes 
to an end, The Tartan board once 
again performs annual ritual of 
giving out Thistles and Thoms. 
These wonderful Thistles and bit
ter Thoms go to the best and worst 
of Carnegie Mellon, during a retro
spective view of the year.
The first Thistle goes to the Uni
versity Center, and those respon
sible for its timely near-comple
tion. Set to open August 1, the 
facility will provide students and 
staff with many needed resources, 
and most importantly a place for 
students to gather. It gets a thorn, 
however, for not being named 
Skibo.
A huge bunch of ripe Thistles go 
to the Spring Carnival committee, 
for organizing one hell of a party, 
including a great program of events. 
Special Thistles go to AB, for get
ting the Mighty Mighty Bosstones 
to perform, and to all the Carnival 
winners for their hard work. In
cluded are DU for beating Phi Kap 
(the first one in years!) and Zeta for 
creating a great booth their first 
time out. PiKAs first place threepeat in Sweepstakes also deserves 
a Thistle, as does Spirit for win
ning the Womens buggy race for 
the second year running.
Thistles go to the Orientation pro
gram for making First-year stu
dents feel right at home with well 
organized programs and enthusi
astic student counselors. Thistles 
also go to the folks responsible for 
the Winterfest. A big gnarly thorn 
goes to students and staff for the 
low attendance of Winterfest ac
tivities, however.
Thistles go to the various trib
utes to those of the CMU commu
nity who have passed on, including 
the memorial for alumna Judith 
Resnik, the memorial constructed 
for Richard Schoenwald, and the 
more recent Yom HaShoah memo
rial.
A Thistle goes to the Presidents 
office for sponsoring Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day.
A disappointed thorn goes to the 
organizers of last years Homecom
ing activities, for holding the fes
tivities over midsemester break  
many students use that weekend 
as an opportunity to get away from 
campus.
Thistles go to the Womens cen
ter and other groups for sponsoring 
voter registration tables and mak
ing it simple for students to get 
involved in elections. A big, irre
sponsible thorn goes to the student 
body for not voting in the Student 
Senate elections  only 5.6 per
cent of eligible students voted this 
year.
An annual thorn goes to the Stu
dent Senate for being a poor repre
sentation of the student body, and 
for not getting their constituents 
more involved and more informed. 
An additional thorn goes to the bad 
publicity for the recent student gov
ernment elections.
A whole bunch of successful 
Thistles go to all the different col
leges and departments that ranked 
so highly in the US News and World 
Report rankings this year, espe
cially CIT and IM, which booth 
 ranked third.
A big challenging, landmark 
Thistle goes to The Heinz school for 
winning a $12.1 million grant from 
the National Science Foundation 
to fund a study on interpersonal 
violence.
A Thistle also goes to President 
Mehrabian for leading CMU in at
taining its many accomplishments 
during his tenure, along with a 
good luck Thistle for the future.
A speedy Thistle goes to the 
womens cross country team their 
11th place national finish. Another 
goes to Senior Melissa Baustert, 
who ranked fourth place in the 800
meter run. Senior Rebecca 
Fruehan also gets a Thistle for 
being the first woman in CMU 
history to receive a national title 
in swimming. One more Thistle 
goes to freshman Keri Mills  
she ranked second in the nation 
among N CAA Division III Singles 
Womens Tennis players.
The Carnegie gets a large batch 
of Thistles for topping off a 100 
years of fine culture activities 
with a spectacular year of com
memorative activities, including 
the 24-hour Centennial party and 
the Carnegie International ex
hibit.
The Drama Department gets 
an annoyed thorn for giving 
Drama majors tickets for the stu
dio plays, while the rest of the 
student body must wait in line for 
tickets distributed on a firstcome-first-serve basis.
Many unpalatable thorns go to 
Dining services for overall ineffi
ciency and unsightly prices. Wok 
n Roll also receives a thorn for 
bad food quality and high prices.
Thoms also go to retail services 
for increasing already high prices, 
particularly for beverages.
Thoms go to the change in alco
hol policy that stopped internal 
citations from being issued, and 
called for state citations to be 
issued instead.
A Thistle goes to the developing 
protocol for receiving grades on
line. However, a frustrated thorn 
goes to the time-consuming reg
istration procedures that still are 
not on-line.
Thoms go to Marty Rimm for 
being an embarrassment to CMU 
with his fabricated research on 
internet pornography. Three 
painful and consequential thorns 
go to the students who stole 
memory from Wean 5419 com
puters and other computer equip
ment from the Cyert Hall cluster.
A Thistle goes to WRCT for its 
conversion to 24-hour broadcast
ing. Thoms go to The Student 
Union for not publishing consis
tently, especially after such a 
promising start during the fall, 
and to The Phoenix for unneces
sarily slandering just about ev
eryone on campus. A Thom also 
goes to the Event Pub for being 
an ineffective means of publiciz
ing local events, but it gets a 
Thistle for being a good idea and 
for its potential.
The parking facilities on cam
pus receives several really incon
venient Thoms for having a very 
limited number of parking spaces. 
The administration gets a Thorn, 
too, for increasing the cost of park
ing fees and fines.
Instructional Technology, gets 
an inconsistent Thom for con
stantly being late and for supply
ing often broken or insufficient 
equipment. The H&SS lounge, 
and the Career Center also get 
thoms for being ineffective facili
ties. ;
Facilities Management Services 
gets a thom for leavirigthe ground 
muddy and full of manure, year 
after year, day in and day out.
Escort services also gets a Thom 
for changing its policy. Having 
specific pick-up sites defeats the 
purpose of the service by making 
students walk to the sites. The 
continued lack of public trans
portation for CMU students is 
also worthy of a Thom.
And lastly, CMU Security gets 
a Thorn for not releasing the its 
Crime Statistics as required.
Most of all, a Thistle goes to all 
the graduating seniors, with a 
second Thistle for good luck. One 
last Thistle goes to the rest of the 
students, faculty, staff, and ad
ministration, as we barrel into 
another year.
Letters to the Editor
Spirit resilient 
despite tragedy
Livn
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
In response to Eric 
Salzmans article 
(Memorial fails to 
see beauty, faith, 4/
22/96), I challenge 
the claim that Yom 
HaShoah on campus reaffirmed peoples 
pre-conceived notions that Jews are vic
tims, they are depressed, they are dying, 
they are dead. Salzman began by say
ing that those pictured in the art instal
lation looked like victims. Had the 
pictures been more closely examined, he 
would have seen many smiling faces and 
many eager and excited eyes. If the 
purpose of the installation had been, as 
he inferred, to see the Jews as victims, 
wouldnt the artist have displayed horrorpictures: smoke from chimneys, death
camps, bodies in graves, starving chil
dren, etc.? This would have been what 
was expected, but instead the pictures 
we saw were much more complex, an 
extraordinary and thoughtful display of 
humanity and life. My second point is in 
reference to the reading of the names on 
the Cut. Salzman notes that the com
memoration ensures that we dont for
get the atrocities of the Holocaust, and 
as we hear the names we remember 
those who have died.
But there is also a vital, second level of 
understanding here that I think Salzman 
failed to grasp. When we read and listen 
to the names, we are reminded of death, 
yes, but also of life. The Jewish faith 
didnt perish, Hitler didnt succeeed, and 
there will be generations of Jews after 
us. On the surface, Yom HaShoah may 
seem like a funeral with the endless list 
of names, but with some insight we un
derstand the event to be a great source of 
strength and pride. Look at symbols like
the pink triangle and the Jewish star 
(given to homosexuals and Jews, respec
tively, to wear permanently during the 
Holocaust). These badges were used to 
segregate and embarass the people, the 
victims, who were forced to wear them. 
Today we wear these emblems not to 
classify ourselves as victims or to re
member the victimization of our ances
tors, but we wear them .in pride, for 
unity and strength. After people read 
names they received a Jewish star sticker 
that said, Never forget: 6 million. I 
dont think that one person who wore 
that Jewish star believed, as Salzman 
writes, that Jews are dead and dying 
people.
I think there was an incredible sense 
of honor in wearing those stickers 
throughout the day.

When I was in the sixth grade, I 
thought, Ill never be able to make it 
through high school. Thats too far away. 
College was an impossibility. Id surely 
die first.
Now, Im preparing to graduate (I 
hope), and Im trying to figure out where 
all the time went.
A few weeks before he died, Ed Schatz 
asked a group of us what wed remember 
most of all about Carnegie Mellon. I 
couldnt think of anything then besides 
the usual gripes (no parking, bad food, 
poor drainage on the Cut), and Im a bit 
ashamed of myself for not having better 
answers. I do now.
I remember attending a Tartan re
cruitment meeting in the old Skibo Ball
room during the first week of classes. 
(For some reason, a lot of my memories 
involve The Tartan. Three-and-half 
years of 16-hour marathon Sunday edit
ing sessions will do that to you.) I was a 
freshman civil engineering student with 
some high school yearbook and newspa
per experience, and I thought it might be 
fun to work on the art staff.
What we really need are writers, 
said Brendan McFeely, a sophomore En
glish major. Can you write?
I was really hoping to draw a comic 
strip, I said.
Oh, writing will be easy, and it doesnt
take that much time, he said. Come 
into the office tomorrow and well find 
something for you to do.
I arrived in the sea of old newspapers 
and food residue that was the papers old 
office at Skibo 50 (that pretty much 
sums up the current office, too, come to 
think of it), and received my first assign
ment: interview Herb Simon.
The Herb Simon with the Nobel Prize 
in economics. The one who, with the late 
Allen Newell, defined and invented arti
ficial intelligence. I didnt even know 
what end of a floppy to stick in a disk 
drive, and they wanted me to interview 
Herb Simon?
With much trepidation, I called 
Simons office the next day, and to my 
delight found him very helpful, extremely 
polite, and perfectly charming. And 
somehow, my article made it onto the 
front page.
Your first week, and theyve given 
you a promotion! said my grandmother. 
Look, it says junior staffwriter!
I should have felt the quicksand around 
my calves then, surely, inexorably, suck
ing me in deeper.
But by my sophomore year, I realized 
I was having a hell of a lot more fun 
working for the paper than I was calcu
lating flow rates and force vectors, and I 
had transferred into what my roommate 
snidely called H and Less Stress (he 
was an electrical engineer).
Other things stand out as well. Listen
ing to the 1992 National League East 
playoffs while pacing the halls in 
Morewood Gardens, until the Braves 
Francisco Cabrera hit the two-out home 
run that ended the Pirates chance of
making a World Series before the end of 
the century. Sitting on the floor of ETower for late-night calculus and phys
ics study sessions. Hearing clothes go 
round and round at all hours of the day 
and night (we lived next to the laundry 
room), and having to redistribute other 
peoples soggy underwear whenever the 
washing machine went off-balance. Go
ing out in the hall to yell at the clods who 
were playing soccer there at 3 am, and 
finding out one of them was my RA. 
False fire alarms during finals week (if 
I ever catch the guy who pulled three in 
one night....).
Ah, memories.
A lot has happened to me since then, 
academically, professionally, and per
sonally. Ive learned, laughed, cried, and 
argued, and made a lot of friends (and 
some enemies).
And before I get too sappy and sloppy, 
Id like to thank everyone whos helped 
me over the years.
I would never have made it through 
here without your help, and I can never 
repay what I owe.
Believe me, Uncle Sam has already 
told me what I owe, and on a writers 
salary, Im never going to be able to 
repay it.

Writer resists raise in minimum wage
There has been 
a lot of talk re
cently about rais
ing the minimum 
wage to $5.15 an 
hour.'Various so, cialists whine that 
$4,25 anhourisnt 
enough to live on, 
and that its about time the government did something. 
Democrats began pushingfor a vote to raise the minimum 
wage a few weeks ago, and typically, many Republicans 
joined them. Fortunately, some of the better Republicans 
prevailed and prevented a vote in both the House and the 
Senate, though will likely come up again. Naturally enough, 
the Democrats have seized the opportunity to bash the 
Republicans for their mean-spiritedness and cruelty. 
Lets look at the facts.
The first question that springs to mind is, why now? Why 
did the Democrats wait until now to push for an increase 
in the minimum wage? For two years, they had a Demo
cratic president and a solid majority in both chambers of 
Congress. If they wanted to raise the minimum wage, they 
couldve raised it as much as they liked, and no Republican 
could have done anything to stop them. So why didnt they?
Why wait until now, when the Republicans are in po.wer? 
Simply put, its an election year. If they lose, they get to 
lambaste the Republicans in front of a frighteningly eco
nomically illiterate electorate. If they win, theyll be the 
champions of the working man, and when hundreds of 
thousands find themselves unemployed, theyll be ready 
with new job programs, retraining programs, and so on.
That is exactly what will happen if the minimum wage is 
raised. People will lose their jobs. When a person is paid 
$4.25 an hour, it is because that is what their labor is worth. 
If the minimum wage is increased, where is the extra 
productivity going to come from? Where is the money going 
to come from?
There was an excellent editorial in The Wall Street Jour
nal on April 24 about the Popeyes restaurant and the 
effects of raising the minimum wage. Like most fast food 
restaurants, they pay the minimum for unskilled, begin
ning workers. If the minimum wage is raised, theyll have to 
cut staff, and the people who remain will find their jobs even 
harder as they take up the slack. The employers cant afford 
to pay people more than they are worth. They are being bled 
white in taxes and regulations as it is. Who cares about their 
problems? Entrepreneurs arent working people. They are 
the winners in lifes lottery who have to

Minimum wage increase proves ill-planned, illogical
James Stepanek
The news in the headlines today is all 
about raising the minimum wage. Many 
people feel that it must be increased to 
help out low-income workers. They also 
feel that the government must step in to 
help out these poor people. However, like 
most other acts of governmental interven
tion in the economy and peoples lives, 
raising the minimum wage is a bad idea.
The naive would argue that raising the 
minimum wage cant be bad: It will let 
those folks at the low end of the pay scale 
be more secure because theyll have more 
money.
Well, if its that simple, why bother with 
a 90-cent increase; theyll still be making 
so little. Why dont we make it a $90 
increase? Hell wed bump them right on 
into the upper class. Everybody would be 
rich.'Wouldnt that be wonderful?
The minimum income as decreed by the 
government would be $180K a year.
Sounds ridiculous doesnt it? (I certainly 
hope it does. If not, please show your 
communist party ID at the door when you 
exit). It is quite obvious what this extreme 
case would do to the economy. Either no 
one would be employed, or the price of 
everything would rise so much as to more 
than compensate for the raise in pay.
You might think: So what? Thats an 
extreme case! It wont work that way if we 
only raise it 90 cents.
Well, reductio ad absurdum can often 
make a good demonstration of how bad an 
idea is. Note: Once you artificially raise 
wages, the cost of everything rises and 
people are put out of work.
Youll be hard pressed to find an econo
mist who doesnt agree with this simple
economic proposition.
In reality, the minimum wage actually 
hurts those whom it claims to help the 
most. Lets look at the numbers. When 
youre an employer, you have some people 
at the minimum and some people with 
experience who are paid more.
Then the minimum gets bumped up. 
Well, the people with experience are obvi
ously going to demand more money than a 
newly hired worker, so they have to get a 
raise also. This will be followed on up the
in industry, but about the same level of 
production. Maybe the unions should hire 
an economist to explain these things to 
union representatives before they sit down 
at the bargaining table.
Lets just further simplify matters by 
looking at this from only a bookkeeping 
angle. A minimum-wage worker, the least 
skilled in your employ, has just been man
dated a 20-percent pay increase. Every 
other worker will get a similar pay in
crease, but at a lower percentage. The pay,

The government can only try to shift wealth 
around, and by trying to do so, generally make 
the population worse off. 
line. The whole price of labor will jump, 
even though minimum-wage workers only 
constitute 4 percent of hourly workers in 
this country.
What happens when the price of an 
input of a product goes up?
Well, either the price goes up or the 
profits fall.
Depending on the product, either there 
will be a cut in profitability if the product 
doesnt have enough demand, or an in
crease in the price if the demand will 
sustain it.
A cut in profits will simply mean the 
business will find a way to cut costs. This 
is very often done by increasing automa
tion, which always eliminates entry-level, 
low-skill, minimum-wagejobs. Either way, 
something goes wrong.
This is what has happened all over the 
country in various industries. Unions, who 
drove up the cost of labor, are now com
plaining that automation has replaced 
them.
Now we have many less people working
as it should, reflects the skills of that 
employee. What do you think youre going 
to do?
I bet you wouldcut the area of most 
rapidly growing labor cost, especially in 
light of the fact that theyre the least 
productive.
There is an underlying fallacy that most 
people commit unwittingly when thinking 
about the minimum wage: People think 
that by simply declaring it, the govern
ment can increase peoples wealth. They 
dont seem to understand that law cannot 
create wealth, only productivity can. The 
government can only try to shift wealth 
around, and by trying to do so, generally 
make the population worse off.
Cant people see that the government 
isnt about income redistribution?
Do you believe in private property, or 
are you Marxist?
If youre not Marxist, which almost no 
one claims to be these days (except maybe 
those in CMU English), then you must 
accept that people have a right to property
and the fruits of their labor, and that 
theft is a crime.
The fundamental problem comes about 
when the government gets involved in 
projects that benefit only certain people. 
Government should be about providing 
services which it is impractical for the 
private sector to furnish. Things like 
police, courts, the military, and some 
regulation of business. Thats about it.
Why, then, does everyone think the 
government has any business in declar
ing that I shouldnt earn more money 
than you?
Why should they tax me at a higher 
rate than you, if I earn more?
Who the hell gave anyone but me a 
right to my money?
Why is it that if a mugger takes my 
money to give to himself he gets ar
rested, but if a welfare recipient votes 
for a politician to take that same money 
from me, hes just exercising his rights? 
For that matter, theres corporate subsi
dies, farm subsidies, the NEA, the NEH, 
and every other example of charitable 
works endowed by largesse from Wash
ington.
Why do these various mobs have any 
more right to take my possessions or 
earnings than any other common batch 
of rioters? The simple truth is they dont, 
but too many people just dont see that.

There is the saying, Two is 
perfect, but three is a crowd.
Alone, two means security. Two 
means separation, fear, igno
rance, and blindness.
When three come together, you 
watch out.
Thats when there is freedom. 
Freedom isnt a two. It isnt com
fortable.
Its responsibility.
If you take the three, you can 
understand how the two works, 
and in that, see that it is all one, 
and right there, you make Con
tact!

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  29 April 19969
Minimum wage increase smacks of overly socialist ideals
MINIMUM, from page 6
pay their fair share.
The posturing about people not being 
able to live on $4.25 an hour is a sham. 
Only a tiny minority of people live on a 
minimum wage job.
Of these, how many will find them
selves unemployed because of a raise? 
How is this going to help them?
Most of the rest are people working a 
second part-time job to help make ends 
meet or to save up for a major purchase, 
or they are teenagers working at their 
first job. How is having to work harder 
going to help them?
How is losing their job going to help
them?
What would happen right here at 
CMU? Many of the food service workers, 
for example, are employed at minimum 
wage. Would CMU keep all of them 
employed if the cost were to go up, or 
would CMU cut back, and maybe re
place them with student workers whose 
jobs are subsidized by the government?
As it is, huge numbers of people are 
kept out of the work force because of the 
minimum wage. Want to hire that bum 
on the street to do general chores for $2 
an hour?
If the government finds out, you could 
go to jail.
What about all the poor inner city kids 
who have little opportunity to find work 
and often turn to crime?
The education in responsibility and 
the commensurate growth of self esteem 
that would come with a job is critical to 
such children. However, many employ
ers cant afford to hire them at $4.25 an 
hour, so they lose.
The arrogance of the little communist 
social engineers in government and 
academia is appalling. Estimates are 
that an increase in the minimum wage 
will put 400,000 to 600,000 people on the 
streets.
Harvard economist Lawrence Katz
says, There are no ways of improving 
the conditions of poor or low-wage work
ing people that dont have some costs or 
some distortions, and, the evidence 
suggests that the gains to low-income 
working people outweigh the employ
ment costs. Im sure that will be a great 
comfort to those people who would be 
put out of work.
By what right do they have to play 
with peoples lives, to decide who will 
work and who wont?What about the 
employers, the people who would have 
to come up with the extra money?
What in hell gives these arrogant bas
tards the right to interfere in a volun
tary relationship between an employer 
and thier workers?
By what right can they mandate how 
someone should set up and run their 
own, personal business? The minimum 
wage needs to be repealed. It pushes the 
least employable people in society into 
dependence and is a gross infringement 
on the rights of both employees and 
employers. It is nothing more than an
other socialist scheme to control the lives 
of Americans.

Columnist carries forth seven clever rules for a moral life
Derek Robinson
It is about time someone re
vised the Seven Deadly Sins. Im 
sure you all know about them, 
probably from the movie Seven, 
or from that silly little book, the 
Bible. Since fire and brimstone 
are no longer concerns in modern 
times, the Seven Deadlies should 
be updated appropriately. Im 
putting forth a new version: the Seven Deadly Moral Mistakes. 
Unless you want to be ignorant and stupid, I suggest you follow this 
list. Were all guilty of at least one of them, and I feel it is my civic 
duty to help you all avoid moral purgatory.
Thou shalt not take money in vain. How many of us have 
criticized wealth? These comments derive their origin in a cesspool 
of ignorance, and are totally unbased. Without money, civilization 
would not exist as a fair and equitable collaboration between people. 
Some people get their money through other means, and others 
greatly abuse its power. These people deserve your criticism, not 
those who earned it fairly.
Why is there a negative connotation generally associated with the 
topic of sexuality? People have forgotten the rule: Thou shalt not 
forsake sexuality. One of the prime examples of this would be the 
stigmatism associated with nudity. What is wrong with the human 
body in its natural form? Let me answer this one for you: nothing! Yet 
old, conservative, hypocritical men and their snooty wives decide 
that nudity is offensive and indecent. Another occurrence of this 
idiocy is parents preferring their kids to watch movies with violence 
over movies with sex. Sex is the celebration of the joys of love, while 
violence is one of the ultimate forms of degradation. Instead of 
criticizing sex and sexuality, criticize those with a closed mind.
Thou shalt not forget ones power. Few people are the victims 
they claim to be. Yet, lawsuits fly left or right over the slightest 
provocation (the latest being over the word slut). Its time we threw 
out the axiom If you dont like it, sue it. If someone slanders your 
character, live with it! Realize the power of mere words. If the 
country is going to ruin, dont shrug your shoulders. Reform or even 
reclaim your government, and make things better. Instead of criti
cizing others, criticize yourself. Better yet, empower yourself to the 
full extent of your potential. Ignorance is not a fashion trend.
Thou shalt not devalue education or intellectual accomplish
ments. Intelligence is something to be proud of. Nowadays, people 
would rather zone out to the boob tube than do something worth
while. I, and many others, feel no need to turn off at the end of a day 
with TV, games, or alcohol. Instead, I pickup a book and continue to 
do something constructive through reading. Instead of criticizing 
waste, criticize those who participate in it.
Thou shalt abide by the Golden Rule. Remember the Golden 
Rule? Treat others as you would be treated. This one alone has the 
potential to make a dent in the others. Respect is a thing of the past. 
People are rude, messy, and inconsiderate. If this isnt true, where 
do litter, graffiti, attitudes, many MTV shows, and New York come 
from? If you would rather not have someone get on your case when 
you make a simple mistake, dont get on someone elses. If you take 
something out of its place, put it back when youre done. Im not 
advocating that everyone be a shiny, happy person; Im just saying 
give others the benefit of the doubt. Well, that leaves two more sins,
and those who are guilty are you and me. Six: Thou shalt take the 
media with a bucket of salt. Dont believe everything you read, and 
recognize why people say what they do. Evaluate it on your own 
standards, and choose for yourself if it is worth the paper its printed 
on. And what have I wrought?
Seven: Thou shalt not be a hypocrite. Do I abide be these rules I 
have gratuitously laid before you? No, not a lot of the time. But I try. 
I keep my own set of moral standards. But when people dont live up 
to any set of moral standards a significant amount of the time, 
problems arise. That is when I put on my crusader costume and 
gripe. Others dont. So please, take my article, inscribe it in stone, 
and go be the best person you can be.
Robinson is currently being beaten up by a mob of ignorant people.

who has lived in this city for the 
past few years has come to know 
the legend of Francisco Cabrera. 
For myself, it went deeper than 
that though. Not only did I have 
tickets to games one and two of 
the Series, should the Pirates 
make it, but Jack Morris was 
already slated to start game one

Harry Calas still rings in my head.
10. ?: After mulling the pros
pect of not having a tenth memory 
to add to this list, I have come to 
the realization that this will al
ways be an empty space. So many 
timeless memories have been 
stored in my head over the years 
that it is difficult to pick out ex
actly one more. In fact, it was 
difficult to pick out the first nine. 
This also brings me to the real
ization that this open space is the 
reason why the passion for base
ball continues to exist, and this is 
something which only those who 
truly understand the game can 
relate to. We will never know what 
to expect; there is a new memory to 
be found around every comer.
Who is to say that the young 
1996 season wont bring another 
rash of memories to ponder? As
Ken Burns once said, This is a 
gamebecause it has no clock, it 
could go on forever. And this is a 
game that begins in spring and 
ends in the fall, which has the 
rhythms of our daily life.

Baseball club 
wraps up season
By DAWN PAPUGA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
This years baseball club 
fought their way through an
other season, with a current 
record of 3-15. The team suf
fered through a ten-game los
ing streak, with their last game 
remaining at Three Rivers Sta
dium. Of their 30 games, 11 
were canceled due to inclement 
weather.
The season had its high points 
even in their lost games and 
unpleasant record. In game 
seven against the Community 
College of Beaver County, the 
Tartans had a six-run fourth 
inning, and their starting 
pitcher, senior Matt Beam, 
threw five solid innings, only 
giving up one run. The team 
played well taking a 9-3 lead, 
but problems hit in the seventh 
inning, where the relievers 
walked seven players and had 
two errors, giving the lead to 
CC of Beaver County. The final 
score was 149.
Game eight for the Tartans 
was played at Three Rivers Sta
dium on April 12  one of the 
two home games for the Tar
tans. Relievers, freshman Jon 
Mayes and sophomore Ed 
Cudahy both pitched scoreless 
innings. Geneva ended up win
ning the game 132.
Games nine and ten were both 
against CCAC South on April 
13. Both games ended in defeat 
that began in the first inning. 
In the first game, as the Tar
tans allowed nine unearned 
runs and two earned runs. The 
Tartans out-hit the CCAC 
team, but still couldnt over
come the first inning deficit. 
Grad student Rich Seder led 
the offense with two hits and 
two RBIs, and Cudahy had a 
three-run home run. In game 
two, after three innings, the 
Tartans were down 7-0. The
three hits by senior Mike 
Monico and the four between 
senior Tom OFarrell and grad 
student Steve Lopez couldnt 
makeup the deficit, leaving the 
Tartans to lose 127.
In games 11 and 12, the Tar
tans were paired against na
tionally-ranked Allegheny Col
lege. In the first game the Tar
tans lost 10-1, and in the sec
ond game they lost 11-0, de
spite Seders two hits.
Games 13 and 14 were a little 
closer to home, at Westmorland 
CC. The Tartans lost 16-6, even 
with freshman Ramon Poos 
three hits, and the hits by 
sophomores Jay McCormack 
and Albert Suh along with se
nior Tom OFarrell in the sec
ond game didnt rack up enough 
points to win, losing 10-0.
On April 21, OFarrell shined 
despite the double loss 8-0 and 
111. He had three hits and 
threw a complete game, strik
ing out six and giving up only 
two earned runs.
The Tartans pulled together 
a win against Westminster Col
lege on April 27, splitting a 
pair. Starter Beam pitched five 
strong innings, and left the 
game at 5-5 in the sixth. 
McCormack came in to close 
the inning. Hits by Lopez, 
Monico, and junior Joe Smarelli 
(hit by a pitch to load the bases) 
helped a great deal when Seder 
hit a base clearing double to 
give the Tartans the lead. Jun
ior left-hander Scott Kemp 
came in on the bottom of the 
seventh to earn his first save of 
the year and preserve the win. 
CMU didnt do quite as well in 
the second game, when West
minster knocked in two runs in 
the seventh, winning 54.
The Tartans end their sea
son on Friday at Three Rivers 
Stadium against Franciscan 
University with a single game 
beginning at 10 am.
Baseball memories prove timeless
NBA heads for let-down

about full circle. This years NBA 
playoffs have reached an all-time 
high for hype. But what about 
next year?
After the Bulls record-break
ing team, a controversy-filled sea
son, and the return of the legends 
to the game, we are poised for a 
huge let-down. There just doesnt 
seem to be anything out there 
that could possibly make next

The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
This is a finale for several sorts. 
For one thing, it is the last col
umn of the year; the sports editor 
is calling for a year in review. It 
is also an end to my Tartan writ
ing career. Will the Suicide 
Squeeze be around at this time 
next year? That is a question 
which remains to be answered. 
Nevertheless, it is a question of 
minimal concern for now. Im 
more concerned with how to put 
the past year, maybe four years 
or maybe a lifetimes worth of 
baseball in perspective.
Since baseball is a timeless 
game (one of the few without a 
clock), and since memories 
are such an integral part 
of the game, maybe the 
best way to sum it all up 
is to recount my top ten 
baseball memories. The 
ten moments which have 
had the greatest impact 
on me are a hodgepodge of 
events which have been col
lected over the years to form 
a scrapbook of the mind. 
They are recent and old, good 
and bad and even ugly. Lets 
see what they are:
1. Game 1, 1993 Na
tional League Champi
onship Series  
Phillies vs. Braves:
It was the first 
post-season 
game I had ever 
attended at my hometown sta
dium, the Vet. It was also the 
first post-season game in Phila
delphia in 10 years.
We were late in arriving to the 
game due to heavy traffic, and as 
a result, were forced to listen to
the top of the first on the radio. 
Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling 
struck out the first five batters 
and with each K, announcer 
Harry Calas voice grew more in
tense.
The game would go 
on to be won by util
ity infielder Kim 
Batiste who had 
earlier blown a 
Phils lead on a 
defensive lapse.
It was an end
ing straight out 
of the movies.
it became one of the greatest 
World Series ever as four of the 
seven games were won by one 
run. Game seven was special in 
itself due to the fact that my fa
vorite player since childhood 
(Jack Morris) was taking 
the hill for the Twins. The 
game defined edge of 
your seat excitement. 
The Twins won 1-0 with 
Morris getting himself out 
of two bases loaded jams in 
late innings and a gutsy 10th 
inning appearance.
3. Some Late August Af
ternoon in 1994: This was 
the day that Bud Selig can
celed the rest of the sea
son and the World Se
ries. It was a day 
never to be forgot
ten, for it was as if 
a stake had been 
driven and then 
pulled out 
of my body. 
Words cannot do 
justice to the anguish 
felt by myself and other 
baseball fans alike. The 
pain still lingers.
4. Game 4,1993 World Se
ries  Phillies vs. Blue 
Jays: This was the first Series 
game I had ever attended. The 
Phils were down 21 in the 
Series and it was crucial that 
they win this game at home. 
Things were looking good up 
until the eighth inning with 
the Phillies leading 14-8. 
Dykstra had hit two home runs 
and Dareen Daulton had 
missed a grand slam by a mere
2. Game 7, 1991 World Se
ries  Twins vs. Braves: This 
was the least likely combination 
of teams one would have expected 
to appear in the Fall Classic. Yet
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Editor
But then it started ... many hits, 
seven runs and two innings later 
I found myself returning home on 
a silent subway. One could al
most hear a pin drop. Sometimes
I still find myself in disbelief that 
they lost that game  a very 
tragic memory.
5. Game 1, 1988 World Se
ries  Dodgers vs. Oakland:
This was the game that Roy Hobbs 
appeared in the body of Kirk 
Gibson. It was also a game in 
which baseball struck me as hav
ing some sort of supernatural 
power. I had fallen asleep at some 
point during the middle of the 
game, and just happened to wake 
up in the bottom of the ninth to 
see the drama unravel. Was it 
meant to be or just mere coinci
dence?
6. September 6,1995: the day 
baseball was saved. Only one man 
could have done this for his 
Herculean feat also had implica
tions of Herculean proportions. 
The man of course was Cai 
Ripken, and the feat I speak of 
was breaking Lou Gehrigs con
secutive games played streak. It 
was the first time all season; following the strike, that baseball 
had made my blood rush. From 
that point onwards, mv zest for 
the game has been unceasing and 
my passion as strong or stronger 
as it was before the strike.
7. Game 5, American League 
Wild Card Series  Seattle 
vs. Yankees: I can justifiably 
say that this was the BEST game 
I have ever seen. It had a little bit 
of everything and although I had 
no emotional attachment to ei
ther team, I distinctly remember 
wiping the sweat off my brow. 
Finally, to see Randy Johnson 
strut out to the mound in the 
10th inning with GnRsWelco'me 
to the Jungle blaring in the back
ground and strike out the side, I 
thought I had seen it all. It was 
truly baseball at its best.
8. Game 7, NLCS  Pitts
burgh vs. Atlanta: I wont even 
bother to expand upon the impli
cations of this game. Anybody
U1x8.x .xx BlBwtCloy M8-x DP
Pat Riley 13 straight playoff 
teams, Phil Jacksonwho could 
break the highest winning per
centage record).
The NBA has many, many 
record holders still playing. 
Charlottes Robert Parish is the 
all-time leader in games played 
and active rebound leader. John 
Stockton and Magic are first and 
second in assists, Hakeem 
Olajuwon just broke the blocks 
record, and Stockton also broke 
the steals record this season.
Dennis Rodman 
has been known 
to gather a 
few rebounds 
and this 
Jordan guy 
is the alltime leader 
in points per 
game.
I think its 
clear the league 
can go nowhere 
but down next sea
son. More convincing: 
after this summers lessthan-Dream Team beats up 
on international competition, 
everyone will be just plain 
bored of basketball. The 
players, the teams, the 
records, and the rival
ries have already been 
over-hyped. It will take 
a major change for the 
1996-1997 NBA season to 
be a success.
All this being said, I still think 
its possible. Prediction: Some 
combination of Ws and Cs will 
make the game exciting. Either 
Wilt Chamberlin will stage a 
comeback, Chris Webber will be 
MVP, and the West Coast (as in 
West of Houston) will relearn how 
to play basketball.

Newcastle fights to gain Premiership
International Sports
by Rahul Aggarwal
English Soccer Premiership
The soccer season started off so 
well for Newcastle United, and 
the Premiership trophy seemed 
destined for Tyneside by Christ
mas. However, a resurgent 
Manchester United and a falter
ing Newcastle saw a narrowing 
of a 12-point gap to Man Utd 
going ahead by three points. The 
outcome of another grueling soc
cer season will be decided by this 
Sunday. It proves to be one of the 
most exciting finishes ever seen 
in English soccer history. There 
is even talk of a playoff between 
Newcastle and Man Utd to de
cide the Premiership. Currently 
the two teams are almost tied on 
goal difference and goals scored 
land, should they win their re
maining games, a playoff would 
be required to decide Englands 
soccer champions.
Personally I dont think it will 
go that far, and I fancy Newcastle 
to pip Man Utd at the finishing 
line. It would be great for the 
North-East should they do it, as 
Sunderland has already clinched 
the Division 1 title and will be 
joining local rivals, Newcastle and
Middlesbrough, in the Premier
ship next season.
This season saw a huge influx 
of foreign stars  famous names 
include: Ruud Gullit, Dennis
Bergkamp, Faustino Asprilla, 
David Ginola and Juninho. With 
the passing of the Bosman rule, 
English teams can now field as 
many foreigners as they want  
previously the limit had been 
three. All have been great assets 
to the English game and contrib
uted significantly to what many 
now regard as the best league in 
the world.
England is preparing to stage 
the European Championships 
which get underway in only six 
weeks. All teams have been 
warming up, and none more so 
than England, who did not have 
to qualify for the tournament. 
Although some bookmakers are 
making England favorites, I am 
backing Holland 
to be victors. Man
ager Terry Ven
ables, who is set to 
step down after Euro 
96, has been experi
menting with his squad 
and has still 
not come up 
with a set 1 
line-up. Furthermore 
some of his key 
players have 
been struck with 
injuries which 
could upset his team selection 
Cricket
The cricketing world acknowl
edged the power of the mighty Sri
the Caribbean and was humbled 
in the first Test by Sherwin 
Campbells 208. The West Indies 
won comfortably by 10 wickets 
and lead the three-Test series 1 
0. This summer, England, under 
a new manager, will entertain 
India and Pakistan in what 
should be fascinating encounters. 
India will also take on South Af
rica this year (and it is rumored 
that they mayplay Australia too). 
Australia will also play Sri Lanka 
and the West Indies.
Tennis 
This year has seen Boris Becker 
get back to form when he won the 
Australian Open, beating Michael 
Chang in the final. Monica Seles 
returned to her Grand-Slam-winning ways when she claimed the 
Australian Open, where she is 
yet undefeated. The next Grand 
Slam tournament is this summer 
in Roland Garros.
This year has been a fascinat
ing one for sports  the English 
Soccer Premiership is coming to 
a nail-biting climax; Sri Lanka 
stunned the cricketing world with 
their audacious batting; Greg 
Norman lost the U.S. Masters 
Golf in spectacular fashion to 
Englands Nick Faldo; and Mike 
Tyson crushed Frank Bruno to 
become heavyweight boxing 
champion.
And lets not forget that

Previously, many would laugh at 
the thought of Sri Lanka being a 
one-day force, but now, when
ever the topic of cricket comes up, 
Sanath Jayasuriyas name is 
mentioned.
He was the catalyst of Sri 
Lankas success and has revolu
tionized the one-day game. Now 
English batsmen are trying to 
learn from this gifted man. The 
World Cup rule allowing only two 
fielders outside the ring in the 
first 15 overs is being imple
mented in English County

their Jayasuriya-Kaluwitharana

Cup Playoffs prove memorable already

From the Point
by Jason Andracki
With the First Round not even 
complete, the 1995-96 Stanley 
Cup Playoffs are already shaping 
up to be very memorable. With 
just over a week of play there 
have been upsets and surprises 
galore.
One of the biggest surprises is 
the Winnipeg Jets. They actually 
beat the Red Wings twice! At press 
time, the series was 32 in the 
RedWings favor. Sure they might 
be facing elimination in the se
ries, but they still have played 
much better than anticipated.
The Red Wings explosive offense 
hasnt really run away with any 
of the games, thanks to tough 
defense on the part of the Jets, 
especially former Penguin Norm 
Maclver. Everybody knows the 
Jets are going to lose, but its still 
great to see the league underdog 
keep from being swept in their 
final season in Winnipeg.
The road has been friendly to 
many teams so far during the 
playoffs. With the exception of 
the Blackhawks, who swept the 
Flames, no team has been par
ticularly effective at home. The 
Penguins, Capitals, Canadiens, 
and Rangers all lost their first 
two home games. With game five, 
the Penguins and the Rangers 
ended their at-home slumps to 
each take a 3-2 lead in their series.
For Wayne Gretzky, this is look
ing more like 1986 than 1996. 
Hes showing St. Louis that he is 
worth all those millions by being
one of the leading scorers in the 
playoffs with nine assists. After a 
lackluster season, linemate 
Shayne Corson is right behind 
the Great One in scoring.
A name noticeably absent from 
the top scorers is the regular season scoring leader Mario 
Lemieux. Lemieux has accumu
lated seven assists, but he only lit 
the red light in Game 5. This is 
obviously frustrating, and 
Lemieux vented his frustration 
on Washingtons Todd Krygier in 
Game 4. After a minor cheap shot 
(he certainly has received far 
worse) from Krygier, Lemieux 
retaliated with a slash and then 
mauled Krygier as he lay on the 
ice. This resulted in nine minutes 
of penalties and a game miscon
duct for Lemieux. This might have 
actually benefited the Pens, 
though, since Lemieux was rested 
for Game 5 whereas the rest of 
the two teams were still weary
from the seven periods of hockey 
played two nights before.
A goal by the Penguins Petr 
Nedved ended what was the thirdlongest game in NHL history with 
44 seconds remaining in the 
fourth overtime period.
There is still a lot of hockey left 
in these playoffs, and in the first 
round alone. My picks for ad
vancing are the Penguins, Rang
ers, Panthers, and Flyers, in the 
East and the Red Wings, Ava
lanche, and Blues joining the 
Blackhawks in the West. Im still 
sticking with my prediction of 
the Penguins versus the Ava
lanche in the finals.
Jason Andracki is a junior pro
fessional writing major. His Conn 
Smytheprediction is Petr Nedved, 
who will hopefully not follow last 
years winner Claude Lemieux by 
leaving the champs over a con
tract dispute.
Tartans finish off 
exciting seasons
tl,Clgy IfhG M8-x DV 
WOMENS BASKETBALL
The womens basketball team 
struggled to an 8-17 record (2- 
12 in the UAA) this year. The 
team started the year strong, 
winning then first two games 
and three of their first four, 
including a 97-18 drubbing of 
Chatham College. The team 
then went on the road for their 
next game and lost the first of 
what would be a five-game los
ing streak. The Tartans broke 
that up by winning three of 
thennext five games with one 
loss coming in overtime against 
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. 
Unfortunately, the Tartans ran 
into New York University in 
their next game and began a 
nine-game losing streak which 
ended when the Tartans plas
tered Chatham again, and beat 
Rochester to finish the season.
Junior Kristen Kupfer led the 
team in scoring and rebound
ing with 13.3 ppg and 8.6 rpg. 
J unior Penny Summerville was 
second on the team in scoring 
with 10.6 ppg and the team 
leader in steals with two per 
game.
HOCKEY
The CMU Mens Hockey team 
is the only team in the WPCHL 
to reach playoffs standing con
sistently in the past six years. 
The Tartans league record 
stood at 10-11, with an over
all record of 14-5-1, putting 
them in first place. The received 
a bye in the first round of the 
playoffs before losing to Penn 
State West in the semifinals, 5-4.
The Tartans were led this 
year by senior captain Roger 
Maddalena and juniors Jim 
Buck and Ray Ardire on the 
offensive end, while getting a 
boost from rookie juniors Relja 
Ivanovic and Anthony Paul. On 
defense, junior netminder, Jon 
Kliegman shone between the 
pipes, while sophomores Paul 
Voulgaris and Bryan Campo 
joined forces with junior assis
tant captain Chris Adukaitis, 
to control the caliber of play.
Freshman rookies Alex Chin, 
Andy Oxnard, Dino Sanchez 
and Steve Leonhardt provided 
a much-needed base for the 
year. Sanchezs game-winning 
goal in their final regular sea
son game against Allegheny 
College was one of the finest 
moments of the season.
There were many fine mo
ments in 1995-96: Anthony
Pauls five goals against 
Edinboro; the team scoring a 
goal every 75 seconds on Rob
ert Morris College (a.k.a. ev
erybody gets a hat trick day); 
Bucks hat trick against the 
University of Pittsburgh; 
Kliegmans amazing game 
against Pitt in the first semes
ter with the 3-1 win; and a 
plethora of mishaps, bonecrunching hits, verbal spars and 
flood-filled rides across state.
TENNIS
The womens tennis team con
cluded one of their most suc
cessful seasons in history. ' 
Amassing 14 victories, the team  
placed fifth in the UAA Cham
pionships, held at the Univer
sity of Rochester. While losing 
to Rochester in the first round, 
the women defeated Case West
ern and University of Chicago 
in their final matches. During 
the fall season, the team raced 
to an 11-1 start and were paced 
by the remarkable performance 
of freshman Keri Mills. Mills, 
holding the best singles record 
in CMU history, placed second 
in the national Rolex Champi
onships in Boca Raton, Fla. 
Earlier this season, Mills was 
also second in the nation, first 
in the East Region among 
NCAA Division III singles play
ers. The young team expects to 
build on their success next season.
The mens tennis team fin
ished their regular season with 
a 7-12 record. The team went 
on to finish seventh in the UAA 
Championships with a 1-2 
record. The team began the 
Championships by losing to 
Rochester and Chicago, but 
defeated New York University 
in their final match. The men 
began their season in the fall 
with a 3-3 record. The team, 
hampered by injuries 
throughout the season, fin
ished strong at the end and is 
optimistically looking forward 
to next season.

their defeats. In their 
wins, they had six; in 
their first two losses, to

CMU golf team ranks third at UAAs, excels at invitationals
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The CMU varsity golf team has 
managed to make an entire sea
son fit into the month of April, 
and looks to wrap up a successful 
season. On April 21-23, the Tar
tans played extremely well at the 
UAA Championships held near 
Brandeis University. The teams 
combined tournament score of 656 
put them in third place. Emory 
University (608) and the Univer
sity of Rochester (632) were the 
only teams with lower scores. 
Seniors Josh Kenin and Greg 
Lassan led the Tartans. Kenin 
shot a 76 on the first day and an 
80 on the second to give him a 
combined score of 156 and sixth 
place overall. Lassan shot a 78 on 
the first day and 81 on the second 
to give him a score of 159 and 
eighth place. Both athletes were 
honored as All-UAA golfers. 
Freshman Brad Kirr also con
tributed, shooting an 82 on Day 2 
to bring down his score.
Coach Rich Erdelyi felt 
that the competition that 
they faced was about what 
he expected. Emory fields 
an extremely strong golf 
team, ranked eighth in the 
country. He said, I thought 
we might be able to make a 
run at Rochester. At the 
end of the first day, Roches
ter led the Tartans by a mere 
four stokes, but went on a 
hot streak the next day to 
maintain the lead. The Tar
tans have been hurt this sea
son by the loss of sophomore 
Byung Kang, last seasons 
individual UAA Champion
ship title-holder, who was 
hurt in a car accident and 
has been unable to play.
Prior to the UAAs, the golf 
team has crammed a num
ber of invitationals and competitions into the short
spring season. At the Washing
ton & Jefferson Invitational in
Amit Kar/Tartan Business Manager
Washington, PA on April 15, the 
Tartans placed second out of nine 
teams. Tire teams combined 
score of 418 was only five 
strokes behind the leaders, 
host Washington & Jefferson. 
Lassan again led the team, 
placing second out of 54 com
petitors by shooting a 75. 
Lassan missed a medal honor 
by one stroke.
Earlier, at the Kings Invi
tational at Mountain Laurel 
Resort, the team finished 
sixth out of 12 teams with a 
combined team score of 675 
for 36 holes. Lassan shot a 
166 to lead the team. Erdelyi 
was pleased with the teams 
performance, and said, [The 
Kings Invitational] and the 
UAAs are the two best totalquality competitions that we 
enter every year. Many of 
the competitors in the Kings 
Invitational were nationallyranked Division II schools.
On April 10, the Tartans hosted 
a tri-meet against Washington & 
Jefferson and Bethany College. 
Lassan shot a 78, gaining a medal, 
as the teams combined score of 
426 placed them in second place. 
The team was narrowly edged 
out by Washington & Jefferson, 
who took first by three strokes.
The CMU golfers turned in 
another impressive performance 
on April 3 at the Speidel Invita
tional in Wheeling, WV. The team 
placed fourth out of 11  only 
defeated by Division II competi
tors Westminster College and 
West Liberty, and edged out by 
Washington & Jefferson by a 
mere two strokes. Senior Rick 
Rothrauff led the Tartans by 
shooting an 82.
The team started the spring 
season with their annual spring 
break trip to Pinehurst, North 
Carolina, where they got in some 
early practice and participated 
in the Concord College Invita
tional. The team came in fifth ou 
of the 10 participating teams, an 
Lassan led the Tartan 
with a two-day 145, placing 
out of 50 golfers. Lassan also 
a Closest to the Pin award 
landing the ball within two 
half feet of the hole on a 1 
yard par 3.
The team is in the process 
wrapping up their season, 
ing at MIT yesterday and 
pating in the Engineers Cup 
day. Lassan looks to gain 
American status by ending 
season averaging under 
strokesand his 3.4 
qualify him as an Academic 
American as well. Erdelyi 
pleased with the teams 
mance this season. He 
[Kenin and Rothrauff] 
very consistent for us, and 
has improved all year. 
also said, At every 
this year, [the team] did 
than they did last year.

SENIORS TAKE ON THE JOB HUNT
WHERE WI 
THEY GO?
By SHARMHA 
VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Features Editor
Its like applying for college; 
you can take the first one that 
takes you, or you can risk it and 
hold out for something better, 
said Christopher Graefe, senior 
communication design major. As 
the end of the semester rolls 
around, many graduating seniors 
anxiously await job offers and 
graduate school acceptance, yet a 
number of students, such as 
Graefe, are already experiencing 
the fruits of their hard work over 
the past four years, with security 
in the near future.
The biggest factor in getting a 
job is being very persistent and 
spending a lot of time going to 
interviews and info sessions, said 
Kevin Stanley, a senior Material 
Science and Engineering major. 
It takes a lot of work and time to 
get a job, but thats what you 
have to do. Unfortunately, most 
seniors find that CMU does not
ease up enough on the work load 
during the last semester to allow 
for adequate preparation for the 
job hunt.
Senior industrial designer and 
philosophy major Andrew Th
ompson found it almost impos
sible to set aside time to look for 
a job while managing schoolwork 
at the same time. It takes time 
to create a portfolio, and if you 
stop working on classes for a sec
ond at this school, you cant catch 
up, he said.
Yet many students, such as 
Stanley and Thompson, have 
found time to look for career op
tions, by looking for work in the 
area or in the form of graduate 
school.
I received a full scholarship 
plus stipend to attend the Uni
versity of Virginia for a one-year 
program in Rehabilitation Engi
neering, said Stanley. This will 
give me time to reevaluate my 
future plans. Stanley hopes to 
pursue medicine at some point.
While most students are given
the chance to interview on cam
pus, either through meetings set 
up by departments or the Career 
Center, many opportunities are 
lost due to travel expenses, ac
cording to Thompson.
Students should be told as 
freshmen to save their money for 
traveling during their senior 
year, he said. Speaking [for 
many designers] they have op
portunities, but no means of 
travel. I know a lot of ECEs that 
are being flown all over the coun
try by prospective employers.
Graefes new position in the 
Robotics Institute allows him to 
do just that. Assisting on visual 
interface and user testing issues, 
he has already traveled to Hono
lulu, Louisiana, Mississippi and 
San Diego for business, and has 
plans to go abroad in the future.
Right now, Im a commodity, 
in that Im applying design to a 
more technical area rather than 
searching for a job in the more 
traditional design fields, he said.
By far, the area of study that
has the highest job placement 
rate is Computer Science; most 
majors have no trouble finding 
interviews and job offers tend to 
come in quantity.
I think that this is an extreme, 
but if you work hard, you will be 
sought out, said Graefe.
Last year, 99 percent of stu
dents who received a degree in 
Information and Decision Sci
ences graduate with jobs, the 
market seeming more feasible in 
this field than others.
One successful IDS senior, 
Holley Anstatt, will be starting 
work for Anderson Consulting in 
Charlotte, North Carolina upon 
graduation, and finds that stu
dents in her major have an easier 
time of it in the job hunt than 
others. Five of the top six con
sulting firms come to CMU to 
recruit on campus, she said. 
Throughout my job search, I in
terviewed with about 12 compa
nies, and they were all through 
the Career Center.

Senior IDS major, Holley Anstatt, will move to North Carolina 
to work with Anderson Consulting.
Audrey Hwang senior, IS major, will take a job with BSG Corporation in New 
York in Information Technologies consulting.
Senior Civil Engineering major Kevin Anderson will work as a research 
assistant at the Univ. of Texas, while getting an M.A. in Civil Engineering.
Senior industrial designer, Andrew Thompson, is 
still job searching, but has plans to travel to 
Germany in the near future.
Kevin Stanley, a senior Material Science Engineering major, 
will attend graduate school at the University of Virginia.Christopher Graefe, senior communication design major, will continue working

Students recycle to make every day Earth Day
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
Though we spend most of our time 
worrying about schoolwork, grades, 
and balancing our social lives, per
haps we would all be better individu
als if we took a minute this week to 
better our environment. This past 
Saturday, April 26, the nation joined 
together to celebrate Earth Day. Many 
CMU students feel that we too can join 
together and make a difference in the 
preservation of the elements in which 
we live. One way we can do so is by 
actively participating in the simple 
act of recycling.
Youve seen those durable blue cans 
as you hastily toss your Coke can in 
the trash on your way to lecture, and 
youve noticed those bluish square con
tainers near the water fountain once 
or twice. In fact, the means to actually 
recycle have virtually been placed at 
our fingertips, so the question is, why 
are so few of us willing to utilize them? 
According to Mackenzie Pitcairn, a 
freshman H&SS student, the answer
is simple. Because throwing a bottle 
or can into the trash doesnt have an 
immediate consequence, people dont 
think about it. Its also that people 
dont get a reward from recycling.
If theyre not going to get a re
ward out of it, they wont do it, 
she said.
Pitcairn is quite enraged by the 
neglect many people impose upon 
our environment. As a result, she 
has no qualms about digging deep 
into our baskets of waste with 
the hopes of collecting all recy
clable items that can be salvaged 
from the final disposal in our 
countrys waste dumps. She ex
plains one such incident. Theres 
this schmuck in Cathedral Man
sions who collects the garbage.
He throws the garbage out the 
windows into the dumpsters be
cause hes too lazy to actually go 
outside. There are two bins out there. 
One is for trash, and the other is for 
recycling. He throws entire bags of 
recycling into the trash. I have pic
tures of him doing this, too. So one
Saturday, I went out there and I dug 
out 14 bags of recycling.
Though Pitcairns approach may 
seem extreme, perhaps if each of us
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art 
did his or her own part in recycling, 
she would not have to be forced to take 
such measures. She said, I do these 
things because I want to conserve our 
environment and keep it clean. I basi
cally dont want to live in a shit hole. 
I care about things. When I see some
one throw something out, it makes me 
angry because it shows that this per
son does not care. People take 
things for granted; I dont. 
Based on the opinions of other 
students, it is evident that 
Pitcairn is not alone in feeling 
that more can be done.
Vanessa Casanova, a fresh
man English major, said, I defi
nitely think that not enough 
people recycle, but its hard to 
say what can be done to get 
them to. When it comes down to 
it, people are just lazy. Its not 
from lack of availability because 
you have recycling bins every
where.
However, Casanova is dis
turbed by the lack of availabilEditor ity of recycling containers for 
all types of paper. She said, The one 
thing that bothers me are the blue 
containers. You can only recycle white 
paper in them. We need containers 
that let you recycle all paper.
Pitcairn also believes that the Uni
versity can provide more facilities to 
accommodate our recycling needs. She 
said,  Next to every single trash can 
there should be a recycling bin. It has 
to be easy for people to do it. But there 
are so many people out there who will 
look right at a recycling bin and throw 
something out anyway. It makes no 
sense to me.
JeffUrban, a junior chemistry and phys
ics major, also sees no logic in this type of . 
behavior. He said, Just considering the 
problems we have with landfills, it makes 
more sense to recycle. Also, why would 
you waste your time producing new glass 
bottles when you can just as well reuse 
the old ones?
Pitcairn said, To me, everything is 
worth something. I say to myself, Thats ; 
a glass bottle. How can you just throw it 
away?
Even aluminum foil; its metal. I  
cant imagine throwing these things 
away, said Pitcairn. Ill carry bottles 
around with me all day even when 
theyre all sticky just so I can recycle 
them.
Students fight for internships
With summer around 
the corner, once again 
students are getting 
ready to enter the excitingworldofintemships. 
Well be heading to PULP FREE Washington D.C., New

By Eric Salzmdn York, Los Angeles, and who just wants to pad his resum, so youve got one 
even foreign countries more question coming. What sort of responsibilities 
would you expect to have here at the Big Smiley 
Corporation?
This is the ultimate trick question. Youve got to 
sound responsible while making it clear that you 
have no problem being stepped on, degraded, or
dered around with no respect, and absolutely no 
expectation of being paid for your labor. You might 
say, Well, as much
for the opportunity to lick the boots of someone who 
may some day say a kind word about us that will 
result in a job. Whats sad is that we actually com
pete for, and often even have trouble getting, intern
ships.
A spiffy resum and a folder full of professors

What makes you qualified to work for my Big

is, Who do you know that will owe me a huge a favor 
if I let you get me coffee all summer?
At this point youll want to talk up your qualifica

toured Nam together, Ive been attending the Big 
Smiley University where Ive earned high marks for 
my classes about the intricate techniques of your Big 
Smiley Corporation. Then you might get a question 
like, Oh really, and just which classes have you 
taken that are specifically relevant to this intern
ship? Of course, you are really being asked, Yeah, 
but did he ever save my life?
This is where youve got to shine. Try a line like, 
Just like when my father learned the firemans

I used to work as a

the unexpected, but 
always need to be prepared to handle whatever 
circumstances that come up. This line tells your 
interviewer two things: you are able to deal with 
changing demands, and more importantly, can make 
a cup of coffee.
Other things you may want to point out when 
seeking an internship are how anxious you are to 
move to a city where you know no one, buy expensive 
clothes for a job that doesnt pay, and basically beg 
for something to do, other than press the big green 
button that says copy. Enjoy your summer, every
one.

IAS president speaks on the Hubble
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Forum Editor
The Hubble telescope, af
ter a series of great setbacks, 
is now a great success, said 
John Bahcall, former presi
dent of the International As
tronomical Society and chair
man of a NASA project to ex
amine the future of astrophys
ics. It is an extraordinary
scribe how the telescope 
worked. Time on the Hubble is 
awarded to the best proposals 
sent in from scientists all 
around the. world. When scien
tists are given time, they write 
programs to set the area of the 
sky where the telescope will look 
and what objects are to be re
corded. Finally, the programs 
are sent weekly up to the tele
scope and operations are cartribute to the many people ried out. Images are sent back, 
who played central roles 
in making the telescope 
happen.
In his lecture last Tues
day in the Mellon Insti
tute auditorium, Bahcall 
discussed the problems 
and wonders the Hubble 
Space Telescope has pro
vided scientists around 
the world. Launched in 
1991, the space telescope 
was found to be defec
tive. However, after a 
televised repair mission 
in 1993, it began sending 
back pictures of objects 
millions of light years 
away. [Its a] gift left to 
further generations on 
the scale ofthe pyramids, 
but the heritage we are 
leaving behind is more 
useful than the pyramids 
and more meaningful, said 
Bahcall of the Hubble, which 
is almost 100 percent better 
than any earth-based tele
scope, she added.
Bahcall then went on to deJim Snyder/Tartan Darkroom 
John Bahcall, former president of the IAS 
on the Hubble Space Telescope.
and then mailed to the scien
tists for analysis.
The telescope was built for 
all of us, said Bahcall. It was 
built entirely with public funds, 
so it belongs to everyone. This
sentiment was apparent 
throughthe images ofthe tele
scope he presented during his 
lecture. He showed the center 
of a spiral galaxy, the birth of 
stars that boiled off gasses and 
impurities as they emerged, 
slowly, from rolling clouds mil
lions of light years wide.
He showed nebulas and black 
holes, and suggested that most 
matter in the universe is dark, 
and that the Hubble is slowly 
giving scientists a new 
view on this Dark 
Matter with each im
age. During a quiet 
moment, he said some
thing that was quite 
interesting: 
Astronomers be
lieve that the universe 
is teeming with intel
ligent life on other 
planets. With this, he 
seemed to sum up the 
joy and wonder that 
astrophysicists feel 
when they search 
among the stars for 
anomalies. The lecture 
was funded by the 
Buhl Foundation and 
brought together stu
dents see what the 
once myopic telescope 
was providing.

Column affects campus
Cracking the Myth
By Amber Benezra
When Suzanne and I began 
writing this column, we had 
something very specific in 
mind. We had attended the 
National Organization for 
Womens March in Washing
ton, and there 
had been no Pitts
burgh media cov
erage of it. This 
was a momentous 
historical event 
that CMU women 
participated in, 
and we felt it was 
our feminist duty to bring this 
information to the campus 
community. Thus, Cracking 
the Myth was born.
In such an obviously maledominated environment, this 
column was supposed to serve 
as an alternative; a place to 
get womens analysis of gen
der issues. These issues af
fect all our lives, and we felt 
it was important for CMU to 
get a feminist perspective. 
We never thought it would be 
easy.
My Cracking the Myth ex
perience has been both ter
rible and awesome. Weve
had our share of conflict and 
disagreement with the admin
istration, weve had to fight to 
gain respect, and to prove that 
our column was worthwhile 
and valuable. But the fact that 
it continues to run, and that 
people have read and re
sponded to us is a great accom
plishment.
The responses I have re
ceived from undergraduate and 
graduate students has been 
overwhelming. After certain 
articles (especially the ones 
about pornography and Hoot
ers Girls), I got tons of email.
A gender issues column at this 
university is a crucial thing.... 
Someone needs to talk about 
these gender politics. ________
Some people totally disagree 
with my point of view, sending 
vehement, confrontational 
messages. The best part of that 
was knowing that I have stimu
lated some kind of critical 
thought in usually closedminded people. If they feel 
like they have to fight me, they 
must consider me a significant 
threat to conservatism. But 
most of the comments I re
ceived have been positive; mes
sages thanking me for discuss
ing issues most people would 
rather ignore.
Do I think I have made a 
difference? I certainly havent
convinced all the CMU com
munity to become feminists, 
but maybe Ive incited some 
people to look at the way they 
function in this society and in 
our sheltered little college 
lives.
Maybe Ive caused people to 
challenge their ideologies, to 
keep asking questions  why 
are womens bodies discursive 
sites for both violence and 
identity?
Why does CMU maintain 
there has never been a rape 
on this campus? Why is plas
tic surgery such a viable and 
profitable indus
try? Why are the 
highest paid
women in
America 
supermodels?
I am concerned 
_________ about next year.
Both Suzanne 
and I are graduating, so who 
will carry the feminist torch? 
A gender issues column at this 
University is a crucial thing. 
Someone needs to be upfront 
and honest about welfare, af
firmative action, the economy, 
our bodies, history, violence, 
rape, and patriarchy.
Someone needs to talk about 
these gender politics, as well 
as the gender politics on this 
campus. Who will do it?

ating senior in the English de

Roe vs. Wade falls short
When the Supreme 
Court justices ruled 
in Roe vs. Wade, they 
based their decision 
on the right to priCracking the Myth vay The risht t0 
By Suzanne Paddock privacy prohibits govFT.-S -iW"-" ir.fr j ernments from in
fringing upon the 
thoughts or actions of individuals. The justices 
who ruled in the Roe vs. Wade case created the 
right to privacy, deriving its main principles 
from the First, Third, Fourth, and Ninth Amend
ments. The right to privacy does not state that 
women have autonomy over their bodies, and 
this is where Roe vs. Wade falls short.
Many feminist lawyers and activists, includ
ing Dr. JoAnn Evansgardner, are advocating 
that a law already exists which protects the 
autonomy of a man over his body. This law, 
:alled the Law of Samaritanism, could poten
tially negate the need for Roe vs. Wade. The Law 
of Samartanism states that one individual is 
not required to volunteer aid to another. It was 
used as a ruling in the case McFall vs. Shimp in 
L978. Robert McFall, who needed a bone marrow 
transplant to live, tried to coerce his cousin, 
David Shimp, a matching donor, to donate his 
marrow. When Shimp refused, McFall took him 
to Common Pleas Court to force Shimp to do
nate.
Judge Flaherty ruled against McFall, using 
the following as his justification:
The question posed by the Plaintiff is that, in 
order to save the life of one of its members by the 
only means available, may society infringe upon 
ones absolute right to his bodily security? 
The common law has consistently held to a 
rule which provides that one human being is 
under no legal compulsion to give aid or to take 
action to save [another] human being. A great 
deal has been written regarding this rule, which 
on the surface, appears to be revolting in a moral 
sense. Introspection, however, will demonstrate 
that the rule is founded upon the very essence of 
our free society....
Our society has as its first principle respect for 
the individual, and society and government ex_ 
ist to protect the individual from being invaded  
and hurt by another. Many societies adopt a 1 
contrary view which has the individual existing 
to serve the society as a whole.
In preserving such a society as we have, it isv 
bound to happen that great moral conflicts will 
arise, and it will appear harsh in a given in
stance. In this case [we] are being asked to force  
one member of society to undergo a medical 
procedure which would provide part of that' 
individuals body... against his will so that the 
other could live. Morally, this decision rests 
with the Defendant [Shimp], and in the view of ' 
the court, the refusal of the Defendant is mor
ally indefensible. For our law to compel the' 
Defendant to submit to an intrusion of his body ? 
would change every concept and principle upon  
which our society is founded. To do so would 
defeat the sanctity of the individual, and would" 
impose a rule which would know no limits, and 
one could not imagine where the line would be - 
drawn. (Flaherty 1978)
After reading Flahertys own words, it is easy to * 
see how the Law of Samaritanism applies to abor* 
tion. But because the Constitution lacks an equalc 
rights amendment, the Law of Samaritanism only V 
applies to men. Surprisingly, many people believe ; 
that there is no need for an equal rights amendment. 
Abortion illustrates one example of how womens ., 
allegedly inalienable rights are violated.
Abortion is a civil right, but instead most people * 
view it as a moral or religious debate. Whether rj 
someone believes life begins at conception or birth | 
is a moral and religious decision, and the First I 
Amendment guarentees us freedom of religion. The ! 
United States does not decree that Christianity is ! 
the national religion, even though those with the 1 
most political clout are Christians. Therefore, Chris
tian attitudes towards abortion, homosexuality, or 
whatever, are not law. Unfortunately, I dont think - 
many people realize this.
Suzanne Paddock is a graduating senior in the 
English department, with a minor in gender studies.English department bids farewell to administrator
By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Im going to miss the fact that she 
recalled the name of every undergradu
ate student. Nina knew their course 
schedules and she knew the ins and 
outs of the curriculum, said David 
Kaufer, head of the English depart
ment. We lost Amy [Hallas] and Nina 
in the same year  thats a double 
blow. Its very tough. Well miss her. 
Im very happy for her  Im sad for 
us. Kaufers sentiment mirrors that 
of many people in the English depart
ment, upon hearing of the resignation 
of Nina Sheehan, the Administrative 
Coordinator for Undergraduate Stud
ies in the English Department.
This will be her last semester at 
CMU. She will be leaving in a few 
months to join her husband and step
children in Elida, Ohio.
Most students know Sheehan as 
their advisor and friend. She is a 
lifesaver to many students when they 
need help with their schedule, major,
minor, or anything else. She always 
goes out of her way to help the stu
dents at CMU. I think the students 
are the reason that were all here, 
said Sheehan. None of us would have 
a job if it wasnt for them. I think they 
should be our number one priority. 
Everyone who knows Sheehan 
agrees that she does everything she 
can to help students.
Martha Sullivan, junior creative 
writing and LCS major, said, Im very 
sad that shes leaving. Shes more in
terested in whats best for the stu
dents than anything else. Shes my 
advisor, but not officially. Shes 
everyones advisor.
Sheehan has held her current posi
tion for almost two years. Shes been 
at CMU for five and a half years. When 
asked about what her job entails 
Sheehan said, I am supposed to be in 
charge of the undergraduate students 
registering, maintaining their folders, 
doing course descriptions and sched
uling, declaring their majors, minors, 
and final exams. What I actually do
and what Im not supposed to do is I 
advise students. Thats the most 
enjoyable part of my job, actually.
I love working with these kids, 
she said. They are the ones who 
make me want to come to work every 
day, they really are. I feel really 
good when I can help them with 
their schedules and anything else 
that comes up. I think that they 
need somebody who is there to ad
vise them at all times. Im available 
eight hours a day, which makes me 
different than their normal advisors 
who have classes and their own work 
to do.
Why has Sheehan decided to leave?
I met an absolutely fantastic man 
who lives 300 miles away,she said.
I married him last month, on March 
23. I havent seen him once since we 
got married. I want to live with my 
husband and my stepkids.
She will be leaving when she sells 
her house in Penn Hills. I want my 
kids to start school in their new school 
district on day one. I dont want to pull
to support her two children who 
were ages three and five at the  
time. She learned of an open 
position at CMU and applied.
She currently lives with her 
two children, Carlee, 10 and Joe, 
12. She looks forward to being 
reunited with her husband and 
stepchildren, Clint, 15 and Jesse, 
16.
Sheehan will miss the familial. 
atmosphere of CMU that she has , 
come to love in the last few years. . 
Ill miss the friends that I have . 
made, the faculty, students, ev-, 
eryone. Ill miss it all.

them out in the middle of the school 
year, she said.
Born in Pittsburgh, Sheehan lived 
here until she married for the first 
time, at which point she left the state. 
She returned to Pittsburgh after her 
divorce and searched for a job in order
mer. There apparently was a 
complaint that I was selling RAD 
forms to students, she said. It all 
started when the school cut back tre
mendously on the number of RAD that 
they produce in the registrars office. I

Brin Us Your Bestseller.
Listed below arc answers to questions relating to the Book Buy Back process. As a stu
dent, we know you have many questions about the book buy back. The process is complex 
but this is meant to provide you with answers to the most common questions and explain 
the role of the bookstore and the wholesaler.
Who is buying my books?
The person buying your books is a wholesale textbook representative from 
Follett Campus Resources.
Which books may I sell?
You may sell any book that you own that is required again on our campus or that 
has a value hi the national wholesale buyers' guide. This guide consists of thou
sands of college textbook titles and their current national wholesale value.
What determines the value of the books?
The value is determined by many factors. If it is being purchased by the book
store for use on campus, you can typically expect an offer representing 50% of 
the net purchase price. Remember, you didn't pay full retail. The Textbook Store 
is one of a few college book stores in the nation that offers a discount to the 
students. CMU students receive a student discount: 15% on new textbooks and 
10% on used textbooks. Your Buy Back Price will reflect your net purchase price.

If the book is not being used again on campus, it has no value to the bookstore. 
Fortunately, we have negotiated with the wholesaler to offer the national whole
sale price to you for your book. The price offered in the national wholesale 
buyers' guide is determined by many factors, including:
 Publisher's retail or list price for the book
 National demand for the books
 Unsold quantities of the book currently in the wholesalers 
warehouse
But I KNOW the book is being used again. Why did I only 
get the national wholesale price for the book?
For one of the following reasons:
 The instructor has not submitted the requisition; therefore the 
store is not aware that it is being used again.
 The quantity required for use in the bookstore has already been 
reached.aring

Although poor condition of a book could be a factor in determin

 Many copies of the text exist, but few7 schools are adopting it

When does it make sense for me to keep my books 
vs. selling?
Any time you have a book that you may frequently use for 
quick reference it is good to keep it. Any time you feel the

on the book, you may find it wise to keep the book. In

CMU faculty, staff bring daughters to work
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Features Editor
When Melissa Cicozi was three years 
old she knew exactly what she wanted 
to be when she grew up  a mommy, a 
nurse, a sunshine, and a monkey. When 
I told this to Sharon Merelli [a toddler 
contemporary,] she told me that I could 
only be one thing, she said. But Cicozi, 
Assistant Department Head of Design, 
knew that her possibilities were end
less, and today, she wants to pass on 
that message to her own daughter, 
Lauren, as well as the 105 other girls 
who attendedlastThursdays Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day program.
Co-chairs of the event, Brenda Grahm 
and Cicozi headed a 15 member commit
tee that invited girls between the ages of 
9  15 to visit the campus and find out 
what career options are open to them - 
just about everything.
Sponsored by the Ms. Foundation for 
Women and locally by the Presidents 
Office, this years program gave daugh
ters of the CMU community a chance to 
experience a variety of occupations avail
able to them by touring the campus and
sitting in on a series of 20-minute lec
tures. The presentations were headed 
by faculty from a number of depart
ments and gave insight into the type of
like working in each respective field. I 
wanted the girls to come away from the 
gallery being able to see all the different 
kinds of work involved in a certain pro
fession, said Tim Saternow, an Assis
tant Professor of Drama.
A number of people have asked, why 
isnt this take our children to 
work day? said Cicozi. But 
this program is set up specifi
cally to address the problems 
faced by adolescent girls from 
low self-esteem to poor body 
image and eating disorders.
The Ms. Foundation offers the 
program as a solution to many 
of these issues by strengthen
ing their resiliency and provid
ing tangible role models that 
girls can relate to. Students 
are reachable role models, said 
Cicozi. Most of them are in their 
20s, and that seems very tan
gible to them.
lecture took place during lunch, during 
which Commander Gwen Elliott of the 
Pittsburgh Police spoke of her experi
ences as women on the police force.

unusual and inspiring occupation and

said Cicozi.
The girls began the day by visiting After lunch, the girls divided up into 
their parents offices, followed by a 20 four tracks, an idea of both Brenda Graminute workout in the Thistle Hall Gym ham and Cicozi,that worked successwith Donna Morosky, who works in fitfully, allowing the girls to make the

I didnt know what I wanted to be at 
that age, said Christina Hagopian, a 
junior communication design major.
 I think a program like this is some
thing I could have really benefited from. 
Hagopian was one of the hostesses who 
escorted the daughters around campus, 
and answered any questions 
that the girls had in mind, from 
financial concerns to SAT 
scores.
A number of people have 
asked, why isnt this take our 
children to work day? said 
Cicozi. But this program is set 
up specifically to address the 
problems faced by adolescent 
girls from low self-esteem to 
poor body image, that can lead 
to eating disorders and other 
conditions.
While the program sent 
across a message of support to 
young women, neither students nor fac
ulty presented femininity as a handicap 
or hurdle to overcome. We implied 
[womens strength] through active role 
models, said Cicozi. But that message 
is never explicitly stated.
Professor admired by students
LEVY, from page L3
come very fond of Pittsburgh. My interest in 
Pittsburgh comes from being here, and my 
interest in history. Levys interest in social 
urban American history has resulted in his 
use of Pittsburgh as a laboratory which allows 
him to take history outside of the classroom 
and bring it closer to his students.
Another tool Levy uses within the classroom 
is film as media for teaching history. Peter 
Stearns, the Dean of H&SS, credits this suc
cessful use of film. Film is shared, experi
enced together, rather than purely on an indi
vidual basis, said Stearns. Levy said,  There 
is a great advantage to working in film, but the 
big problem is in getting students to take film 
seriously. Thus, he likes to have the students 
watch films in a group which makes the expe
rience a shared one. This is something not so 
easily achieved when reading, which is an indi
vidual experience.
While his extensive use of film may be his 
most well-known tool, Levy believes that, the 
most difficult thing in a classroom full of stu
dents is to get students who are reluctant to 
talk in a group to share their ideas in a class 
discussion.
As the recipient of this years EDS award 
Eugene Levy will stand with the various col
lege award winners on the Universitys com
mencement platform.
- Joseph Devine, Associate Dean of H&SS and 
head of the EDS Awards Committee, said,
Levy has been a big influence in innovative 
courses both here (CMU) and outside the uni
versity. He has labored steadily, somewhat 
quietly for a long period of time, this longevity 
had great impact, and came across very strongly 
to the committee.
The Elliot Dunlap Smith Award was first 
presented in May of 1980, and is named after 
a man whose great interest in curriculum de
velopment led to an award which has been 
maintained for 16 years.
This years committee consisted of three 
former award winners and two students, as 
well as Joseph Devine who headed the commit
tee.
The two part process begins with an an
nouncement to the University in the late fall 
which invites nominations requiring three sig
natures and a two page background. In Febru
ary, these nominations are reviewed by the 
committee members and the final candidates 
are selected.
This years two finalists were then asked to 
submit more detailed information. At the final 
meeting, held two weeks ago, each committee 
member gives a verbal assessment of the can
didates before the final decision is made.
Dean Stearns, who won the award in 1992, 
says this about Levys work at CMU, He and 
I have been here together for quite awhile. The 
care he puts into his teaching and the kind of 
planning he does has been very impressive ... 
Hes someone I like to learn from, too.
Dare to Share helps community
Seniors make plans for future
olmCwtoy IfhG M8-x iC
Another soon-to-be graduate 
with settled plans is Darren 
Wan, an IM/Econ double major. 
Wan will be working at JP Mor
gan in New York in their Audit 
Plus Program, as a controller 
a type of internal consultant. I 
believe that most of my colleges 
are getting jobs, he said. From 
my interview process, Ive found 
that CMU students know how to 
roll punches and deal with situ
ations.
With business rankings ris
ing, many IM majors are gradu
ating with some sort of plan in 
mind, if not stable jobs secured.
Engineers, CS and IS/IDS 
people seem to have better job 
selection through campus re
cruiting, said Wan.
I think [those fields] are more 
desirable in the market, because
its a technical skill that will make 
someone a lot of money, said 
Thompson. Industrial has that 
same potential  there are only 
about 7,000 industrial designers 
out there, which can put more 
pressure on you.
Senior history major Carolyn 
Segermark is one of the few se
niors who will be j oining the peace 
corps after graduation. Ill be 
going to West Africa in August to 
do development, gardening, and 
construction. Im excited, a bit 
nervous and scared, she said.
While many fine arts students 
tend to branch out on their own in 
search of security through their 
own merits, such as independent 
shows, Lauren Shuke, senior art 
major, in planning to apply her 
skills to computer graphics at 
Dow Jones. This position will 
allow me to utilize my minor in
psychology and marketing back
ground, she said.
Probably by far, the field of 
study that most most students 
fear as far as the job market goes 
is acting. While the drama de
partment remains competitive, 
drama majors such as Lisa 
Sheridan feel getting an agent 
in the hot areas (L.A. or New 
York) is really difficult. Our 
biggest opportunity to meet 
people is the League presenta
tions in New York, she said.  
We each have two minutes to 
present ourselves... its very in
tense. It seems everything that 
weve worked toward in four 
years comes down to two min
utes.
After graduation Sheridan 
plans to participate in an excl'ange program with the Cen
tral School of Drama in London.

and he thought that I was selling RAD forms to

Dare to Share 96 took CMU 
students out of the clusters and 
dorms to help their surround
ing communities. On Saturday, 
about 150 CMU students vol
unteered their time to paint, 
hammer, and pour concrete in 
the four annual community ser
vice projects.
Projects included building an 
outdoor classroom and paint
ing games on the playground at 
Friendship Elementary in 
Shadyside; more painting, land
scaping, and building at Fort 
Pitt Elementary in Garfield; 
and similar tasks at McCleary 
Elementary in Bloomfield. 
Ideas came from a town meet
ing with people from the 
Bloomfield/Garfield area. Sup
plies and funds came from cor
porate donors, GSIA, and the 
CMU provosts office.
Dare to Share started as an 
offspring of the I Have a Dream 
tutoring program. Both are run 
through GSIA and center on 
helping children. Dare to Share 
was originally planned three 
years ago as a community day 
with a food and clothing drive. 
In 1994, activities included 
helping with a reading center 
at Fort Pitt. Last year the orga
nization expanded to include 
local YMCAs and other similar 
sites in the day-long event.
That year, 1,200 people from 
CMU and the community vol
unteered their time and the
daughter who will be starting here in the Fall. 
Students should not worry. I will do my best. 
The most important advice that Sheehan can 
give to students is this. I think that students 
need to learn to take charge. They need to be 
more aware of what they need to accomplish. 
There is one change that Sheehan hopes to see 
throughout the school. I think we [faculty and 
staff] should spend more time with the students. 
Amy [Hallas] and I, I believe were milestones for 
the department. Amy started in August of1990, 
I started in October of 1990. I think Amy and I 
have really made the department a place where 
students are welcome and feel comfortable. 
When asked about her plans for the future, 
Sheehan said, My plans are to hook up with my 
husband and be a family which we havent been 
for a long long time, the kids and I. There are 
a lot of universities nearby, and I hope to find a 
job at a university there.
mother of all playgrounds was 
built.
The turnout this year was 
not as high as last year: about 
400 people volunteered. Orga
nizers found it was difficult to 
coordinate the different sites 
and a lack of advertising in the 
communities. Karla Karanza, a 
masters student in GSIA and 
one of the organizers, said, 
Publicity is everything in the 
community. This is a commu
nity project. CMU is there to 
help.
One CMU student who was 
helping fit into both groups, 
Jean Camp, a PhD student in 
EPP, explained that the first 
time she came to Dare to Share 
she found herself helping in her 
own neighborhood. Friendship, 
where she was painting the 
playground, is four blocks from 
her neighborhood.
She said, I was especially 
happy to paint the playground 
because it made me sad to see 
kids play on blank concrete 
when I would drive past the 
school, she said.
Some of the other CMU stu
dents who painted at Friend
ship were Delta Gamma sisters 
working on their community 
service hours.
Anne Donovan, an informa
tion systems junior, said she 
enjoyed meeting people from the 
community. You dont usually 
get that at school. Its fun be
cause the kids are actually here. 
Its good to see whos 
benefitting, she said.
Carly Cenedella, a sophomore 
in psychology, said, [Its great 
to] see the little kids and how 
happy they are.
The children who were 
benefitting helped out too. 
Dylan Moore, a sixth grader at 
Schiller Middle School, said, 
This is a lot of fun and its 
great to see everyone come out 
and help Friendship. Its better 
than doing chores.
Tim Ueckerseifer, a seventh 
grader at Reizenstein Middle 
School, said Its fun to annoy 
grown-ups and mess around. 
The organizers also felt the 
benefits of the projects. Steve 
Woyicki, a senior in IM and an
other organizer, said Its great 
seeing a project come from just 
an idea, doing it alongside your 
friends and professors and little 
kids running around in t-shirts 
that cover their whole bodies.... 
Its one of the things Im most 
proud of that Ive done at CMU. 
I never got involved in a 
project from the start and fol
lowed it through. I know Im 
capable of it now, continued 
Karanza. I know how fulfilling 
it is now. She plans on doing 
similar projects when she moves 
after graduation.
Karanza and Woyicki arent 
sure where the organization will 
go in the future since they are 
both graduating. Ideally, we 
can pass this on to other col
leges and have them adopt a 
neighborhood. We need to take 
responsibility for our commu
nity, said Karanza.

DIVERSIONS
Volume 90, Issue 24The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania29 April 1996Local restaurants provide off-campus alternativesCollege students go out on the town to chow down
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Staffwriter
A funny thing happens when you ask college 
students what their favorite restaurant is. Unlike 
the rest of the known free world, they do not base 
their choice on the quality of the food, the ambi
ence, or the service. Instead, their evaluation is 
based primarily on one variablecheapness. This 
appreciation for frugality becomes blatantly obvi
ous when one tells you their favorite restaurant is 
Taco Bell. Other factors that play a subordinate 
role in their choice are whether delivery is avail
able and how late the restaurant is open.
When one does have money for something more 
than a $.59 burrito, Pittsburgh offers a wide array 
of dining options to choose from. Many of the 
typical fast food franchises can be found within 
walking distance. More interestingly, so can a 
variety of unique local restaurants. Nearby 
Shadyside, Oakland, and Squirrel Hill are all home 
to many locally-based eateries, and the South Side
and the Strip District offer diners with even more 
variety in their cuisine.
Two of Pittsburghs culinary claims to fame can 
be found in Oakland. The Original Hot Dog Shop 
(known as The O) and Primanti Brothers are 
Pittsburgh classics. The 0, with its cheap menu 
and 24-hour availability, places it high on the list 
ofCMU favorites. Also in Oakland are Hemingways 
and C. J. Barneys, which are frequented by CMU 
students. They both feature American menus in a 
bar-like atmosphere. Even closer to campus, The 
Union Grill offers a similar menu in a similar 
atmosphere.
A trip to dine in Shadyside often means shelling 
out a few extra dollars, but it also means a good 
meal. The Balcony, with its live jazz, is a favorite 
with CMU students for good food in a relaxing 
atmosphere. Pasta Piatta is a good restauraunt to 
go to with the parents, because as Carl Venezia, 
freshman chemistry major, points out, its so 
good, but its so expensive. A bit less expensive, 
but still full of atmosphere, Max and Ermas offers
a menu of fare of American standards.
Squirrel Hill is home to other CMU favorites, 
with places such as Gulliftys. It is not Gulliftys 
large and varied menu that leads to its popular
ity, but rather its large selection of delicious 
desserts. Sweet Basil of Squirrel Hill also re
ceives good reviews from students. For a late 
night snack, Eat n Park happens to be open and 
cheap, bringing many CMU students there at all 
hours.
For international food, several restaurants fea
turing a foreign menu are located conveniently on 
South Craig Street and are visited frequently by 
students. Ali Baba sports a Middle Eastern menu, 
Star of India offers Indian fare, Yum Wok features 
Chinese food, and Cafe Azure presents a pricy 
French menu. In reference to choosing a Chinese 
restaurant, Albert Chough, H&SS undeclared, 
says that sometimes Chinese restaurants can be 
sketchy so you have to pick and choose carefully, 
but his favorite place in the area for Chinese food 
is China Palace in Shadyside.
A meal often neglected but deserving of men
tion, is breakfast. Pamelas, which has locations 
in Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, and Oakland is a 
favorite with CMU students.
On any given Sunday morning, students fill 
the small dining areas while eating from a typi
cal breakfast menu. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, and 
sausage are available for a relatively inexpen
sive price.
Occasionally, CMU students venture out of 
the neighborhoods around campus and into other 
areas of Pittsburgh. The Strip District and the 
South Side are common destinations. Both ar
eas offer a variety of unique eateries for the 
more adventurous diner.
While CMU students will probably never be 
called discriminating diners or culinary experts, 
it seems that a lack of money rather than taste 
dictates their choice of restaurants. Until col
lege students somehow become financially se
cure, Pizza Outlet and Taco Bell have nothing to 
worry about.
Pittsburgh dining establishments receive critical commentary
ByAMETKAR

Sitos Cafe
Sitos Cafe is a tiny establishment in 
Oakland specializing in Mediterranean 
cuisine. Although there is only seating 
for about eight people, all of whom will 
feel faint construction vibes, I can hardly 
recommend another place more. Sitos 
represents the kind of value that col
lege students typi
cally dream of.
Although the 
menu caters to all 
degrees of hunger 
at reasonable 
prices, the combi
nation platters, for 
those of us feeling 
truly ravenous, de
serve a special 
mention. These op
tions come with an 
entree such as 
Chicken
Kabob or Paprika 
Chicken, rice beau
tifully tossed with 
nuts, a-side of veg
etables (not of the 
boring steamed va
riety), tabooli or salad, yogurt dip or 
hummus, and as much pita bread as 
you care to stuff into your gob. Never 
mind the mind-blowing quantity of food 
being served here, the incredible thing 
is really how good it all is. You wouldnt 
normally expect a meal costing between 
$6.25 and $7 to you speechless but...
Sitosis in a transition phase and 
isnt doing home deliveries at the mo
ment, something which should make 
hearts bleed all over campus  few 
things are as satisfying as having a real 
meal delivered to your room. So, at the 
moment, the best time to go to .Sitos is 
when youre with at most two other 
people and are planning to go into Oak
land to buy CDs or something funky for 
your nose. If youre driving, bring some
thing back for all your friends  they 
will love and worship you.
Cafe Sofia
Cafe Sofia is a very recent culinary 
addition to the CMU neighborhood, hav
ing assumed the spot next to Crimes of 
Fashion, previously occupied by Cafe 
Mocha. Along with a new sign and fake 
brick wallpaper has come a small but 
unique menu serving authentic Bul
garian cuisine (for those of you who 
dont know such tilings, Sofia is the 
capital of Bulgaria).
I suspect that this place could become 
popular with CMU students if the own
ers can add a few more items to the 
menu. Cafe Sofia has a simple, informal 
atmosphere and is ideally located for 
students who have been spending far 
too much time getting shafted at Pipers. 
Theres seating for about 25 people in 
an establishment that still feels more 
like a truck-stop diner than an Eastern 
European cafe. (I suspect that has a lot 
to do with the view of the Exxon station 
across the street.)
However, Cafe Sofia is less about 
atmosphere and more about getting 
more bite for your buck than you would 
expect after a cursory glance at the
menu. If youre after a late lunch or a 
mid-afternoon snack to hold you over 
until dinner, I can hardly recommend 
Cafe Sofiamore, especially if you havent 
been there yet. Although the portions 
are a little on the small side, the prices 
are more than justifiable, especially con
sidering the surprising quality of the 
food. Themoussaka, forinstance, at $3.50 
is the perfect savory hunger suppressant 
when you know that its too late to stuff 
your face and 
dinners just a few 
hours off. However, 
youd have to eat 
three of them if you 
wanted to make a 
legitimate meal out 
of it, and then you 
might as well have 
gone somewhere 
else.
When more items 
start appearing on 
the menu and the 
management can 
afford to buy better 
wallpaper, Cafe 
Sofia will become a 
viable dinner op
tion. But that wont 
happen unless you 
go there and eat something whose name 
you cant pronounce.
The Union Grill
The Union Grill is a comfortably famil
iar place for a lot of CMU students. The 
atmosphere inside is classy and semiformal but still manages to be lively. The 
general good nature of the service helps 
to make any trip to the Grill a relaxing, 
if costly experience.
The Union Grills strengths are really 
its atmosphere, (helped by a well-stocked 
bar), and its location on South Craig St. 
because the food is, at best, sufficient. 
The menu touts, Honest American 
Food, but is very limited and has been 
pretty much the same for far too long. 
This is especially true for vegetarians, 
for whom a trip to the Grill means yet 
another boring salad or a giant mush
room.
Thats not to say that the omnivores 
among us cant get a decent make at the 
Union Grill  its just that well prob
ably end up parting with more green 
than we would normally like to. Prices 
at the establishment make it unrea
sonable for the average CMU student 
to go there more than once every week 
or two. A cheeseburger that goes for $7 
is about $3 too expensive, regardless of 
how much free mayo comes with it. 
Some of the other items on the menu 
represent better value. The stir-fries 
are typically generous and the chicken 
dishes are also good. I recommend the 
Jamaican Jerk chicken, though I cant 
remember which day to recommend it 
on  consistency seems to be a little 
troublesome for the chefs at the Grill 
when they arent making burgers. The 
best time to go to the Grill is when 
youre feeling thrifty, arent in a hurry, 
and are with a group of friends who 
have mastered the art of conversation. 
A knowledgeable bartender and a few 
liqueur coffees will keep you and your 
crew sitting at your table, chewing the 
fat, well after youve finished your meal.

Cafe Sofia has brought delicious 
Bulgarian food to Forbes Avenue.
By ERIC J. SALZMAN
Tartan Personnel Manager
Got any money? Probably not. So, 
like me, youre probably not heading 
out to the Top of the Triangle on a 
weekly basis. Big portions, edible taste, 
low prices, and a relaxed atmosphere 
are what many a college student seeks 
in a restaurant (at least its what/look 
for). Oakland, in between two univer
sity campuses, offers many choices for 
just my kind of gourmet. Just so you 
can follow my logic, Ill explain the four 
things I look for in a restaurant, all of 
which I rate on a scale of Mmms: 
food, atmosphere, service, and price. 
For all you math majors out there, that 
makes the perfect score Mmm Mmm 
Mmm Mmm, but not one restaurant 
scored a perfect.
The Original Hot Dog Stand
If you havent been to the Original 
Hot Dog Factory yet, you probably 
dont even know that Carnegie Mellon 
is in Pittsburgh. However, Im bound to 
review the Oakland joints. The 0 is 
our local greasy spoon. Taco Bell is 
probably the only place in existence 
that will beat the 0s prices if you 
order correctly. A large pizza, formerly 
just three dollars, is still a bargain at a 
measly four bucks. Start to order top
pings though, and the prices may seem 
a little more regular. A basket of shrimp, 
a heaping plate of spaghetti, and of 
course, hotdogs, are all also very rea
sonably priced.
The O fries are a Pittsburgh legend. 
The really exciting thing about them is 
that you get a lot -ra real lot. Prices at 
the 0 cant really be beat so they get 
a full Mmm. The atmosphere is kind of
a mix of a sports bar, a college cafete
ria, and South Central Los Angeles 
(hint: do not go alone late at night). You 
can make all the noise you want and 
usually find enough room to sit, so 
another full Mmm here. As for service, 
well, there isnt really a whole lot. The 
people working behind the counters
are generally friendly enough, but they 
dont often go far out of their way to 
make sure you have everything you need: 
no Mmms. Their attitudes just might 
have something to do with the fact that 
they dont get tips, but thats just specu
lation. The food itself is nice if you dont 
make a habit of eating it. Once a month 
is about my limit, but that once a month 
is pretty good: Mm. The 0 is located on 
Forbes Avenue. Total score: Mmm Mmm 
Mm.
Charlies
If you like O fries, but dont feel the 
need to feed a small nation, you may 
want to try 
Charlies up on 
Melwood Avenue 
right by the Giant 
Eagle on Center 
Ave. This is my ab
solutely favorite 
restaurant in 
Pittsburgh where 
you get Pepsi in a 
glass jar (free re
fills),- a quality 
meal for two for 
about $15, and 
some of the most 
incredible grease 
Ive ever tasted.
Connected to a bar,
Charlies is a sur
prisingly quiet 
little hippie joint with posters of musi
cians from the 60s and 70s covering the 
walls. As long as youre not going with 
too large a group (the restaurant doesnt 
hold much more than 20 people), the 
atmosphere is a perfect Mmm.
The food is also incredible. My favorite 
is the Wally World Deluxe  a cheese 
steak with marinara sauce, 
grilled onions, green peppers, 
hot peppers, and mushrooms
 Yum! A regular size is usu
ally enough for me to eat din
ner and still have leftovers for 
a late night snack or break
fast the next day, making the 
price even more reasonable.
Charlies is probably best 
known for its hot wings which 
vary on a scale of six to 10.1 
find the number eights to be 
just right, but Ive seen a 
grown man cry and refuse to 
finish his plateful (remember 
that, Neil?). The food at 
Charlies is delicious, but 
youre going to have to wait a 
while for it. Just about the 
only aspect of Charlies that 
prevents a perfect score is that 
you usually have to wait a 
while for your food. Waiting is 
not necessarily a bad thing in 
a restaurant, but for the col
lege student often on the run, 
service needs to be fast. Over
all score: Mmm Mmm Mmm 
M. For Charlies, youll want 
to head down Forbes and make a right.
Mad Mex
For something different, turn left. 
If you can find your way to the corner 
of Bates and Atwood, youll find a little 
bit of Mexico in Pittsburgh with Mad 
Mex. Prices at Mad Mex are a little
touchier, although they have half 
prices specials after 11 pm (Mm) 
than at Charlies or The O (four and 
a half dollars for an appetizer of nachos, 
salsa, and guacamole), but that goes 
along with the young professional 
crowd youll find there. The crowd prob
ably goes along with the huge bar that 
takes up almost half of the restaurant.
The atmospshere, while relaxed 
enough, is so noisy and crowded that 
you may find yourself more into the 
conversation at the table next to you 
than at your own  points lost here. 
Atmosphere: Mm. The service is ter
rific all the way from the charming
Jason Siegendorf/ Tartan Photo Editor
hostess to the humorous waiter. When 
I asked which was better, the chicken 
or steak burrito, the waiter told me 
that he is a vegetarian and wouldnt 
know.
The food is also terrific, especially 
if you like Mexican food. Taco Bell is 
nice if youre not going to be around 
other people for a few hours, but 
Mad Mex will tickle your tummy 
without turning your innards into 
an eruptable volcano. The portions 
are quite large so leftovers are a 
pretty safe bet. All in all, Mad Mex

The Union Grill provides students with 
an alternative to campus dining.
gets a score of Mmm Mmm Mm Mm.
The three restaurants are all 
pretty good depending on what youre 
looking for. Stick to the 0 for some 
fast, greasy food during a football 
game. Charlies is your best bet when 
out with some old friends for a 
lengthy meal and reminiscing. Or, if 
its you and that special someone, 
give Mad Mex a shot. Youll have to 
get extra close just to hear one an
other. Bon appetite!

Looking for a way to beat the heat this 
summer? Ifyou havent startedthinking about 
it yet, its not too early to check out what will 
be hitting the air-conditioned theaters around 
the country. So grab a bag of artificially but
ter-flavored popcorn, a gigantic Pepsi, a box 
of Jujy Fruits and take a peek at what you 
might want to spend seven bucks on this 
summer.
Twister
Ill go out on a short limb and predict that 
this will be one of the summers biggest 
moneymakers. From the director of Speed, 
Twister stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton as 
storm chasers pursuing a destructive tor
nado. Hold onto your hats and look for great 
special effects.
Striptease
For some reason, Columbia Pictures just 
cant decide whether to market this movie as 
a comedy or a drama. It stars Demi Moore as 
(guess what?) a stripper. Considering the poor 
success of Showgirls and Demi Moores lack of 
acting talent, I say tell everyone its a comedy, 
especially consideringthatthedirectoris best 
known for Honeymoon In Vegas.
Mission: Impossible
The theme of turning old television shows 
into movies may never end! Tom Cruise takes
the lead role in this film from Brian De Palma 
who is best known for movies like Carlitos Way, 
The Untouchables, and Scarface.
Trainspotting
Adapted from a cult novel by Irvine Welsh and 
directed/produced by the same team responsible 
for 1994s eerie andmean: spiritedShallow Grave, 
this film set in the slums 
of Edinborough promises 
to Satisfy your darker side;
The Cable Guy
Matthew Broderick is 
a cable subscriber who 
gets more than he bar
gains for when he accepts 
the offer of a few free 
movie channels from 
oyereager installer Jim 
Carrey. This one might 
be a more intelligent 
comedy than Carrey has 
done in the past since it 
is directed by Ben Stiller.
The Fan
This is a weird one.
From the director of Top 
Gun and True Romance 
(Tony Scott), Robert 
DeNiro stars as a fan who becomes obsessed with 
a celebrity played by Wesley Snipes. No, its not a 
comedy. It is an edgy thriller.
Independence Day
Otherwise known as ID-4. Yes, thats what 
those annoying signs you may have been seeing 
are referring to. Its a war of worlds in this scifi thriller starring Bill Pullman. Get this: It 
opens July 4th! How clever.
A Time To Kill
John Grishams latest 
cinematic adaptation. 
You know the story: Man 
is good guy. Man gets in 
legal trouble. Man finds 
some weird legal loop
hole into a happy end
ing. Oh, and dont forget 
the chick. This time its 
Sandra Bullock who is 
wooed by Matthew 
McConaughey (keep an 
eye on him, hes going 
places).
Last Dance
Too bad Sharon 
Stones follow-up to an 
Academy Award Nomi
nation was the atrocious 
Diaboiique, which was in 
theaters for about five 
minutes.
Now shes playing a 
woman on death row with a bad Southern ac
cent. Dead Woman Walking? I wont get my 
hopes up.
1996 Castle Rock Entertainment 
Erin Grant (Demi Moore) resorts to dancing at a 
strip club to earn money for a custody battle.
Alaska
Heres one for the whole family. Two kids trek 
across Alaskan wilderness to rescue their pilot 
father after his plane has crashed. Along the way, 
they rescue an orphaned polar bear cub who helps 
them on their journey. If only he could talk.
The Spitfire Grill
This winner ofthe1996 Sundance Film Festival j 
Audience Award is the story of a young womans ! 
search for a new direction in her life and the effect 
she has on a small Maine community.
Stealing Beauty
From acclaimed director Bernardo Bertolucci 
(.The Last Emperor, Last Tango In Paris) this film . 
stars Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. Filmed in; 
Tuscany, the cinematography and scenery alone : 
will make it worth your while.
Ransom
With star Mel Gibson and director Ron 
Howard, this remake of the 1956 film of the 
same name is sure to be a big hit. Gibson plays | 
a Silicon Valley millionaire who doesnt take ; 
any crap from some neer-do-wells who kidnap 
his son.
In addition, Keanu, Arnold, Bruce, and Jean-! 
Claude wont be without their own summer 
installments. Ifyou dont see anything you like, 
then forget it, theres just no pleasing you. From ; 
the looks of it, however, this summer looks to be ; 
a nice mix of quality sleepers and big-budget 
blockbusters.
Cat Among the Pigeons Mfhj9ZA2hd 2GMfx..x. .HxMA2Z

Tartan Staffwriter
The last time I saw a play at the Kresge 
I was seated so far to the right of the stage 
I could not see any of the action that 
occurred upstage. When curtain time 
arrived, I moved to an unoccupied seat in 
the center of the theater so I could see all 
of the action. Despite the fact that the 
seat was empty, one of the ushers tried to 
get me to move. I politely refused. Since 
the play was about to begin, the usher left 
me alone and I was able to see Act I in 
.peace.
At intermission, another usher came 
over to me and asked me to return to my 
original seat. I asked him if the seat I 
currently occupied belonged to someone 
else. He said no, but that I would still 
have to return to my original seat. Ever 
so politely, I informed him that I could not 
see from that location and I preferred to
Incorruptible shows 
future potential
stay where I was. Seeing that I was not 
about to move, he gave me the evil eye 
and walked away.
After being treated so rudely (and being 
sold such an awful seat when better seat
ing was available), I vowed never to re
turn to the Kresge as a matter of prin
ciple. That was, until I was asked to 
review the latest Kresge production, 
Georges Feydeaus Cat Among the Pi
geons. Im glad I agreed to this request, as 
Cat provided me with over two hours of 
non-stop hilarity.
According to the Kresge press release, 
Cat is a masterpiece of French farce ... a 
commentary on the ills of society [that] 
deals with the consequences people face 
when they pursue personal pleasure, for
saking all else. Personally, I didnt see 
Cat as a social commentary, but I must 
agree that it is a masterpiece.
Directed by Mladen Kiselov and star
ring Ted Jacobs and Rebecca Metz, Cat
perfectly blends all the elements of farce 
into one exceptional show. There are 
perfect timing (people are almost con
stantly entering and leaving the stage), 
hilarious misunderstandings, and an ar
ray of fantastically offbeat characters, 
including an inept songwriter, a lovecrazy general, a Frenchman who suffers 
from an extreme case of bad breath, a 
lustful opera singer, an obese virgin, a 
governess that doesnt speak English, and 
a suave bachelor reminiscent of the Hugh 
Grant character in Four Weddings and a 
Funeral.
Fernand Bois dEnghien (played by 
Jacobs) is that bachelor, who has finally 
decided to marry the daughter of a wealthy 
baroness. However, when Fernand goes 
to tell Lucette, his former lover, (played 
by Metz) that he is about to marry some
one else, the two spend the night together 
and subsequently he cannot gather the 
courage to inform her of his impending
nuptials. Making matters worse is the 
fact that the upcoming marriage has been 
announced in the days newspaperthe 
same day the glowing review of Lucettes 
concert has been published.
Caught up in the mayhem are General 
Irrigua (David P. Metz), who wants to 
marry Lucette and is willing to kill any
one who might stand in his way; Ignace de 
Fontanet (Timothy McGhee), an elderly 
gentleman who suffers from chronic bad 
breath and who eventually becomes 
Fernands ally in keeping his nuptials 
hidden from Lucette; Gontran de 
Chenneviette (Zach Shaffer), the father 
of Lucettes child; Lucettes overweight 
sisterMarceline (Cristina Wager); Camille 
Bouzin( Jayson W. Williams), a songwriter 
who, after visiting the home of Lucette for 
the first time, almost ends up being mur
dered and is later arrested for indecent 
exposure; and Fernands fiancee Vivianne 
(Janan Elizabeth Raouf), who along with
her mother (Cynthia Lisa Cole) and gov
erness (Victoria Prescott Reiniger), fcjelieve that Fernand has never been witft a 
woman in his life.
It is impossible to single out anyiof 
the actors in this production, as they 
all perfectly undertake their roles, 'it 
is the kind of brilliant ensemble act
ing comparable to the casts of Cheers, 
Seinfeld, and The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show.
Cat also features a wonderfully de
signed set, as well as the kinds of 
costumes that win awards for their 
designers. A great cast, superlative 
production values, brilliant direction, 
and a hilarious script made Cat Among 
the Pigeons a great show. Even the 
curtain call is vastly entertaining. Ijm 
certainly glad I decided to return to 
the Kresge.
Incidentally, this time I got an ex
cellent seat.

When modern-day monks run 
out of money, they get a credit 
. card. But in the old days, back 
in 1250 A.D., that was not an 
option. So what you did was dig 
up the dead and sell their parts 
as holy relics. At least thats 
what the monks in Priseaux, 
France did in Michael 
Hollingers new play at City 
Theatre, Incorruptible.
Based on the strange and sor
did times during which the rel
ics of saints were worshipped 
and monasteries and convents 
were vying for public attention, 
this farce details the lives of 
Brother Martin (Tim Moyer), 
Brother Olf (an Uncle Fester
like David Doepken), Brother 
Felix (Scott Greer), and Charles 
(Douglas Wing), the Abbot. 
These three monks are in dire 
straits: Their saint wont work 
miracles, theyre out of money, 
and the Pope is on his way to 
make sure things are running 
smoothly. However, when 
Agatha (Barbara Russell) be
gins luring people into her con
vent with some phony relics, 
the monks get mad. They track 
down the huckster, who turns 
out to be the wily, one-eyed min
strel, Jack (Peter Pryor). The 
monks threaten Jack with an 
ultimatum: join the order and 
help them gain relics for the 
monestery by borrowing them 
from graveyards or be turned 
over to the constable after they 
falsely accuse him of killing a 
Jew. Jack accepts the former 
option and grave-robbing is 
afoot.
The play is a comedy. It is not
designed to be serious or realis
tic or deep and, excepting one 
brief clinker of a scene at the 
very end, it succeeds admira
bly. Playing on a beautiful rec
reation of an old monastary, de
signed by David P. Gordon, the 
actors are strong and quick. 
While some of the dialogue is a 
bit too anachronistic, the play 
finishes up nicely and with a 
minimum of cheap laughs.
Doepken stands out as the 
most farcical of all the charac
ters. His lumpy manner and 
voice make him the perfect 
church novice who accepts a 
robe and candle because he can 
do little else. Wing is an impos
ing and intelligent Abbot, and 
Moyer plays Brother Martin 
with a tenacity that is memo
rable. Only Greer and the Ab
bess (Russell) do not fit well in 
the play, but their parts are 
limited mostly to the end.
Michael Hollingers scriptis s 'arprisingly strong for a brand-new 
work. His other credits include 
some childrens theater as well as 
a play called Tiny Island that re
cently won the Roger Stevens 
Award from the Fund for New 
American Plays. With a few more 
performances and rewrites, Incor
ruptible may become a strong and 
classic work. But see it now as it is, 
and you wont be disappointed.
Co-producedwith Philadelphias 
Arden Theatre, the play overall is 
a nice romp and a good closingseason effort. While it is not a 
shining example of a farce, it is a 
comedy, and is, at times, very 
funny.
Incorruptible will run until May 
5, and reduced tickets are avail
able for all shows by calling 431- 
CITY for details.
Arcadia Mfh4x. M1x8.8dA1v ZhGM1x\
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
There are certain writers of 
whom would-be playwrights 
like myself are required to be 
in constant and immeasurable 
awe. One of them is Tom 
Stoppard. His Arcadia is the 
kind of play you read or watch 
and, after almost every line, 
say to yourself, God, I wish Id 
written that.
The play revolves around the 
rather scandalous happenings 
at a British estate, Sidley Park, 
in the early 19th centuiy. The 
play jumps back and forth be
tween this period and the 
present day, where a couple of 
eccentricliterature scholars are 
heavily researching the history 
of Sidley Park to find out ex
actly what happened. (Forgive 
the vagueness; to get into spe
cific details of the plot would 
cake much more space than I 
have and probably ruin some 
ofthe plays delightfulness.)
Much of the play deals with 
certain intellectual issues like 
chaos theory and thermody
namics, and I admit that a good 
deal of it went over my head. 
But it is the mark of a good 
production that I (and, I will 
speculate, the rest of the audi
ence as well) followed as much 
as we did, and that we under
stood the implications of the 
work of a certain adolescent 
genius whose unfortunate tem
poral location(1809, laterl812 
 before the invention of cal
culators) prevented her from 
redefining the study of math
ematics.
The Pittsburgh Public 
Theaters production, directed 
by Edward Gilbert, is remark
ably smooth and serves the play nothing but praise, 
fully. The latter is a particular In the program, Tom Stoppard

of the wit and believability could 
easily get muddled. There were a 
few problems: Some of the stag
ing in the 19th century scenes 
felt a little forced; certain books 
that were used in both time 
periods did not seem to age, 
despite the 187 year gap, as 
Stoppard points out they should 
in his script; and the 12-yearold actor playing Gus and 
Augustus was generally lousy, 
but forgivably so.
Other than those few things,

TI I I I I I I I I I 1 I
movies you may have seen before....
By JOHN BIGGS
Thursday, May 2 
Persuasion
Theres a gal named Jane Austen who wrote a lot 
of swell books .See, whats happening is that movie
makers are getting tired of making movies by live 
people and are moving into the realm of the evil 
dead. The dead are rising from the grave and writ
ing scripts, and guys named Hawthorn-Wilson and 
Tucker-Tumer are buying them, changing them so 
they get pretty endings and lots of sex. Anyway, 
theres my opinion.
So this one is a Jane Austen book-turned-movie. 
Its all about people in Victorian England running 
around falling in love. What happens is this woman 
played by Amanda Root is about to marry a sailor, 
tried and true. But her fancy father wont let her 
marry such a poor sailor. So the sailor gets angry 
and goes away. Finally, he comes back rich and 
bothered because the woman threw their love away. 
There is a happy ending, for all those interested. 
Please see: Sense and Sensibility.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, May 3 
Sense and Sensibility
This ditty was written by Emma Thompson and is 
based on another of Austens works. Starring Hugh 
Grant and Kate Winslet, this movie is pretty excit
ing. See, these two women want to get married, but 
there are four guys to choose from. What do they do? 
They send the guys to London where they watch 
them, incognito, in order to see which one is the best. 
Pretty sneaky, huh? Dont you agree?
So finally, Thompson and Winslet marry two or 
three of the guys and all live happily ever after, 
except the guy or guys who didnt get married. They 
threw themselves, into the Thames. And, guess 
what! Two showings of S & S will be free with a 
capital ee. And, get this, Babe will be shown at 10 
pm on the Cut. Pretty sweet deal, if you ask me.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Saturday, May 4 
Jumanji
There are humpty-back camels and long-necked 
geese. There are monkeys and lions and giraffes: In 
fact, this movie is a whole menagerie of wacky, 
computer-created creatures. Starring some kids 
and Robin Williams in furs, this is like Jurassic 
Park in Maine. Anyway, its a pretty fun movie, with 
a lot of fun stuff going on. It loses some petrol near 
the end of the film, but its still pretty neat. See it 
with someone who wears far.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight
Sunday, May 5 
Alligator
This being my last DH2210 of the year, Id like to 
thank all those who made my work possible: direc
tor Lewis Teague, Robert Forster, Perry Lang, Jack 
Carter, and writer John Sayles. I would just like to 
say that this movie is about a big, terrible alligator 
that comes out of the sewers to eat people in Chi
cago. Finally, with a tear in my eye and my hand on 
my wallet, Id like to say that this movie is campy 
fun and well worth the price.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

I suspect that it is due to the 
close contact the members of 
the group have  this is par
ticularly the case in a univer
sity setting.

This untitled painting, influenced by Italy, is 
part of Carisa Blacks post modem wall mural.
Gia Cavalieres paintings and 
drawings, while also demon
strative of this fictitious school 
of art, have a repetition of form 
that borders on obsessive and 
ensures her separation from the 
rest of the school. The form that 
is repeatedand even repeated 
in-the-round in a 
large ceramic work 
 often bears high 
heels, angry teeth 
and a more than 
striking resem
blance to a penis. 
The form lives a 
strange evolving 
life, splayed out 
across page after

though, the work 
that compels me the 
most is the large

ramic entity that oc

There is something 
really disturbing 
and haunting about 
this figure. It is quite 
an effective piece.
Jason Siegendorf/ Tartan Photo Editor 
Works by David Vanrich and Gia Cavalieres enhance Forbes Gallery.
This talk about a school has 
been a preface to Carisa Black. 
Black had a well-defined though 
under-developed style when she 
arrived on campus four years 
ago.
Throughout her stay here she 
has maintained her singular 
style, andit has matured a great 
deal. Visually, Black achieves 
depth in an unconventional way 
 by applying highlights and 
shadows in an all-or-none fash
ion. The effect is similar to look
ing at a colored topographical 
map of the subject, and it is 
uniquely her own.
Black has a keen wit, and this 
is evident in her works. Draw
ing primarily on the familiar 
Romantic themes of Christian 
mysticism and Classical myth 
might seem out of step, perhaps 
too much so in our school of art.
Black, however, is playing with 
art historical forms  particu
larly the Romantic forms. Her 
work draws on what we have all 
seen in art books and muse
ums; this, however, not for the 
purpose of restating it. She 
recontextualizes the form  be 
it David, Christ, or the form of 
an altarpiece  by making it 
over in her distinct visual style. 
With her sense of humor and 
history, often an anachronistic 
and alien twist is added to the 
form (in a work not shown, God 
reaches out to Adam, not to give 
him life but to offer him a beer). 
Often what emerges seems to 
be some sort of visual joke, but 
we are struck most with the 
sense that we are being told 
something, some deep concern 
is being given voice through a 
new form of allegory.

Comic Book Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
For my farewell column of this, 
my third year of Comic Book 
Chronicles, Id like to talk about 
a very special book, Innocent By
stander. Its special because its 
created by a Pittsburgher, Gary 
Sassaman, and its one of the most 
sincere, straight-from-the-heart 
books Ive ever read.
The only one that even comes 
close to the sincerity of Innocent 
Bystander is the touching coming-of-age book Shades of Grey 
(which youll hear more about 
next year, I promise).
About a year ago, when the 
first issue of Innocent Bystander 
hit the stands, I purchased it be
cause of the Pittsburgh connec
tion. I usually try any new small 
press book I can find, so I cer
tainly wasnt going to let one go 
by that is done by a fellow 
Pittsburgher. What I discovered 
was one of the most unique books 
I ever read. Sassaman basically
is writing about himself. You 
might think this could be boring 
because too many people think 
their lives are interesting enough 
for books or movies, but with 
Sassaman its true. After all, how 
often can people say they were 
mistaken for one of the Three 
Stooges nephews? When 
Sassaman isnt recounting quirky 
tales of his childhood hes telling 
stories we can all identify with. 
Sassaman might have a few years 
on me, but reading this book still 
brings on a rush of memories.
In Innocent Bystander #2, one 
of the stories in the I dont want 
to grow up section titled My 
Army at War is something I can 
identify with. From the 100 for a 
dollar plastic soldiers to the TV 
room (being) my Waterloo, this 
was so familiar it was scary. The 
plastic soldiers are now my 
nephews, and I always aced any
thing regarding Napoleon in his
tory classes since I fought un
der the Duke of Wellington with 
my uncle.
Perhaps its the Pittsburgh con
nection that makes Innocent By
stander so bittersweet, but I think 
it has more to do with timing. Im 
entering the last week of my jun
ior year of college with my senior 
year and graduation looming omi
nously in the future. If theres 
one thing that I can identify with, 
its a comic book that proclaims I 
dont want to grow up! on its 
cover.
Wouldnt it be nice to worry 
about that rubber band that holds 
the G.I. Joe figures together 
breaking, rather than finals and 
finding a job?
I know Im a bit more nostal
gic than most people, but un. less you were born a fully ma
ture adult, theres something 
for you in Innocent Bystander. 
You can take a trip down the 
smooth part of memory lane 
filled with lunchboxes and
crushes without the Pittsburghlike potholes of being picked 
last in gym class and being 
teased because you didnt wear 
the latest clothes like Jams. 
Before you go home for the sum
mer, pick up Innocent Bystander 
#2 at most local comic shops 
(Phantom of the Attic is a fiveminute walk from campus) or 
order it from the artist.
This is the last time Jason 
Andracki will be a junior pro
fessional writing major. The ad
