Art Kassel Scheduled 
For Annual Military 
Ball Friday Evening
Nationally Known Band 
Makes Local Debut 
In Thistle Hall
DECORATIONS SHOW 
MILITARISTIC SPIRIT
Orchestra Stand Represents 
Shell; Soldiers Pictures 
Portray Wars
Art Kassel and his Kassels in 
the Air will -make their Pittsburgh 
debut on Friday night at the an
nual Military Ball. Kassels repu
tation is nationwide, and many 
Pittsburghers have heard his music 
over national radio networks. The 
Kassels in the Air are now tour
ing the Middle West after long 
term engagements in Chicago and 
the West. He played for the Ju
nior Prom at Notre Dame last 
year, and his latest engagement 
has been at the Hotel Bismarck, in 
Chicago, rendezvous of Worlds 
Fair vistors. The orchestra com
mittee reports that it is only due 
to unusual circumstances that it 
has been able to secure a band of 
this caliber.
Kassel Will Play Favorites
The "Kassels in the Air are 
primarily a dance band, and have 
earned praise wherever they have 
played. Kassels style is compara
ble to Bernie Cummings' and feat
ures an unusual saxophone sec
tion. According to Darrell V. Mar
tin, radio editor of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, this orchestra is one 
of the outstanding dance bands of 
the country. Kassel will play some 
oC his own compositions, including 
Hells Bells, and In 1933, tho 
theme song of the Chicago Worlds 
Fair. He will also play a number 
of hit tunes which he has recorded 
for Columbia records. Some of 
the Kassel recordings will be 
broadcast by radio station WJAS 
at one oclock Friday afternoon. 
As one of the many features of the 
ball, the dances will be announced 
by short bugle calls.
Elaborate decorations will feat
ure this years ball. In accordance 
with the military theme of the dec
orations, the orchestra stand will 
represent the midst of a bursting 
shell, set off from the dance floor 
by a picket fence. Suspended from 
the ceiling of Thistle Hall will be 
a cargo dirigible, while, flags and 
military insignia will decorate the 
walls. The foyer of the , hall will 
be arranged to represent nurses 
headquarters during the war pe
riod. Life-size pictures of soldiers 
representing the Civil, Revolution
ary, and World Wars, together 
with posters of a fantastic war, 
will make up the decorations. The 
downstairs entrance-lobby will be 
arranged with a tent and Join the 
Army signs to represent a sol
diers recruiting station. The tickettaker will portray a hard-boiled, 
war-time sergeant. Tickets may 
still be obtained from members of 
Scabbard and Blade or at the Y

Post-Military 
Ball to Follow 
Football Game
Music To Be Furnished 
By Mundays Band 
From 9 to 12
The Michigan State football 
dance will be held on Saturday, 
November 11, in Thistle Hall from 
9 to 12 oclock. George Munday 
has been secured to furnish the 
music.
Since the football dance follows 
the annual Military Ball, the afTair 
will be much on the order of a 
post-military ball. The decora
tions from the preceding night will 
still be intact to lend a martial at
mosphere to the occasion.
George Munday is one of the 
well known entertainers in this 
district. During the last winter 
season he was engaged at the Ho
tel Mayfair Roof Garden. This 
summer he toured the eastern part 
of the United States, playing at 
places such as Shady Grove Park, 
near Uniontown, and Idlewild 
Park, near Ligonier. George Mun
day and his orcestra have also 
played at several of the fraternity 
houses on the campus.
At the previous football dance 
the novelties, which were made to 
suit Halloween festivities, were 
well received. Following the 
scheme of a post-militaiy ball, the 
novelties again will be made to fit 
the occasion. Tickets may be pro
cured at the door for the . usual 
price of $1.00.

Presents Series 
Of Ten Lectures
Student Councils 
Discuss Carfares
Representatives of the Carnegie, 
Duquesne, and Pitt student coun
cils met Wednesday, October 25, 
to discuss the lowering of street 
car rates. The Pitt Student Coun
cil included the .idea in its program 
of things to do for the year, and it 
was at its suggestion that this 
meeting was held.
Definite plans were not made at 
this meeting, but each representa
tive agreed .to discuss the sub
ject with his administration 
and to find out the number of stu
dents using the street cars each 
day before any action is taken. As 
soon as this information is obtain
ed the representatives will hold an
other meeting to decide what steps 
should be taken in approaching the 
street car company on the question.
Coal Research Laboratory Finishes 
Third Successive Year of Activity
Editor's Note:This is the sec
ond in a series of articles on the 
^ork of the research laboratories 
fc>f Carnegie. Another will follow 
[ an early issue.
.'Carnegies Coal Research Lab
oratory ha s finished its third year 
f activity. Starting in 1030 with 
group of eleven scientists and 
ine laboratories under the direction of Dr. H. II. Lowry, it has 
own until now its staff numbers 
enty-seven men with thirteen 
odern laboratories and complete 
k^liop facilities at its disposal. It 
' is located in Engineering Hall 
where it occupies part of the lower 
two levels facing the Bureau of 
Mines.
The organization of this lab
oratory in 1930 was the result of 
need expressed in the Interna
tional Conferences on Bituminous 
Coal for an independent research 
laboratory to attack fundamental 
problems in the study of coal. The 
laboratory was established on an 
initial five year plan through the 
aid of the Buhl Foundation in co
operation with six large American 
usiness firms.
Among . the many marvelous 
fleces of apparatus to be seen in
this modern research establish
ment are balances which measure 
accurately to one millionth part of 
a gram and a gas analyzing device 
which can identify the constituents 
in a sample of gas whose volume 
is less than a tenth of a cubic 
centimeter. With these the tiny 
samples of coal used in the ex
periments are weighed and the 
gasses resulting from their com
bustion under various conditions 
analyzed.
The firms contributing this sup
port are the United States Steel 
Corporation, the General Electric 
Company, the Koppers Company, 
the New York Edison Company, 
the Standard Oil Company of New 
Jersey, and the Westinghouse 
Electric and Manufacturing Com
pany. Carnegie supplies the lab
oratory space and laboratory service as well as financial aid.
Each year a limited number of 
students are accepted for gradu
ate work in fuel technology. These 
men follow a program carefully 
worked out in accordance with the 
requirements of the committee on 
graduate instruction.

Laboratory is not known to PittsCContinued from Page Three)

Professor Reports 
Teaching Situation
Prof. Glen U. Cleeton, head of the 
Department of Industrial Educa
tion of Carnegie, will present his 
report on the certification of teach
ers of Industrial Education at a 
meeting of the Association of Lib
eral Arts Colleges at Harrisburg 
on November 10.
Professor Cleetons report will 
cover the results of an investiga
tion, begun in April, 1932, of the 
problem of certification require
ments. It will contain a summary 
of requirements for teachers in 
twenty-eight states, the recommen
dations of various professional so
cits concerned with teaching, the 
results of a special investigation 
of opinions of teachers and super
visors, and recommendations on 
the kind of courses which sh'ould 
be required in Industrial Education 
Teacher Training Courses. Pro
fessor Cleeton will further recom
mend that the graduate of a fouryear teacher training course, pro
viding he has maintained a C av
erage during his college career, be 
granted a temporary certificate 
which can be made permanent 
after five years of teaching expe
rience and the completion of a 
fifth year of college work.
If Professor Cleetons plan is 
adopted, a fifth year course in In
dustrial Education will have to be 
organiKed at Carnegie, and stu
dents falling below the C average 
will be eliminated at the end of the 
sophomore year.
This report was drawn up at the 
request of the Association of Lib
eral Arts Colleges of Pennsylvania 
in an attempt to raise the standard 
of teacher preparation in this 
state.
Students Body 
Is Penalized 
For Holiday
Holiday Taken Following 
Notre Dame Game 
Is Unauthorized
PENALTY GIVEN IS 
UNEXCUSED ABSENCE
Unsanctioned Holiday 
Is First Occurrence of 
Kind at Carnegie
Tho Administration has ruled 
that those students who disregard
ed the schedule of classes on Oc
tober 23, and took an unauthorized 
holiday will be charged with an un
excused absence. This means that 
the absentees will receive a zero 
grade for the day, according to the 
customary procedure for unexcused 
absences occurring at any time 
during the year.
First Unsanctioned Holiday
Since this absence from class on 
October 23 of a large number of 
students was the first unsanctioned 
athletic holiday to occur in the 
history of Carnegie, the Adminis
tration is not interested so much 
in punishing the student body, as 
it is in working out a constructive 
plan for future types of celebra
tions that will not, in any manner, 
interfere with the schedule of 
classes. Therefore, the penalty 
which has been imposed is to be 
considered an impromptu method 
of remedying the absences.
An occurrence of the holiday 
such as experienced on the Monday 
following the Notre Dame victory 
is, according to the Administration, 
undesirable from several points of 
view. The parents of a great many 
of the students are making unus
ual sacrifices in order to send their 
childien to school. It is only fair 
to the parents that the students 
receive the utmost instruction.
A Thoughtless Disturbance.
In the spirit of festivity the stu
dents often, in an unthinking man
ner, participate in disturbances 
which they would shun In ordinary 
circumstances. Such things as 
student parades Involve an inter
ference. of. traffic, a probability of 
damage to property and to life. If 
a misfortune such as one of theso 
should occur, it would be very em
barrassing to the Administration. 
Also, the campus program, a cal
endar which has been arranged a 
year In advance, is unsettled by a 
holiday, so that there is much ex
pense In the reorganization.
For the present, a faculty com
mittee, and a studont committee 
composed of the members of the 
Student Council, are jointly study
ing the question for next year. 
They will recommend a plan that, 
will correct the undesirable situa
tion which arose tills year.
Colonel Fairley 
Finally Remedies 
Parking Problem
After years of thoughtful consid
eration and preliminary calcula
tion the "ground crew has final
ly arrived at a.solution for tho 
complex parking problem on tho 
campus. Without blue-prints, 
transit, or slide rule, Colonel Fair
leys staff has constructed lines 
which mark the extent of each 
cars parking space along the street 
siding Industries ^ Building and 
Commons Building*.
These lines which (at the time 
of this writing) are white, measure 
three and one-half inches in width. 
Doubtless the crew has given some 
thought to the near-sighted pro
fessor and the somnolent student.
For a Scotch institution the 
ground staff has been exceeding
ly generous in apportioning park
ing area for each car. The aver
age width of the modern automo
bile is seventy-two inches. The 
width of the space allotted each 
car is exactly ninety inches. This 
permits a superfluity of eighteen 
inches. It is rumored that this ex
cess space was made necessary by 
the antics of a certain Dean. How
ever. there is no doubt that the 
real reason lies in the rapid in
crease in the number of motorcy
cles used by commuting students 
during the past few years. Each 
parking area is really for one au
tomobile and one motorcycle or 
fr one automobile and one-half of 
an Austin.
B. L. (before lines) many stu
dents parked their decrepit Model 
T on top of the grade at a fortyflve degree angle with the curb. By 
pushing the vehicle (?) slightly 
they could, of course, coast down 
tho lill and tl,ius avoid cranking

Miss Martha Connor, 
Fortner Librarian, Dies
Miss Martha Conner, former In
structor in tho Carneglo Library 
School, died at the home of her 
brother in Trenton, N. J., October 
25.
Miss Conner resigned her posi
tion on the faculty of the Library 
School in 1931 because of poor 
health. She recovered sufficiently, 
however, to head the library school 
of Our Lady of the Lake College, 
San Antonio, Texas, for a year.
Her book, Outline History of 
the Development of the American 
Public Library, was used through
out the country in library schools.
Council Will Be
Guests at Dinner
President Baker will enter
tain the members of Student 
Council at dinner this evening 
at the Pittsburgh Athletic As
sociation.
The event is an annual treat 
enjoyed by Student Council 
whose members are the guests 
of honor of President Baker. 
Dinner conversation touches 
upon subjects made exception
ally stimulating by the per
sonal opinions voiced by the 
president, and his guests value 
this personal contact with 
President Baker, which is, of 
necessity, so rarely experienced 
by the majority of the stu
dents. .
The meeting of Student Coun
cil this week will be held to
morrow night at 7 o'clock.

Commons Annex Selected 
For ISelv Faculty Club Room
Room Designed by Prof. Kostellow To Open Dec. 1; 
'To Be Used for Meeting and Dining Hall; 
IFi/l Be Furnished from Donations
By ELIZABETH STUART
Tho history of the new Faculty 
Club Room is a most interesting 
one. Early in the history of Car
negie, Prof. C. C. Leeds, head of 
the Department of Works Manage
ment, and one of the four men 
longest in the service of the 
school, started a club room for fac
ulty members In the basement of 
tho College of Industries. The 
equipment at that time was a 
checker board. Other equipment 
was added gradually, and tho pop
ularity of the room grew until, in 
1919, a Faculty Club Room was 
fixed up on the third floor of the 
Administration Building. Because 
the club rooms are Inconveniently 
located, the rooms are to be moved 
to their new location in the Com
mons Annex.
Cafeteria Started in 1917
As perhaps the older members of 
the faculty will recall, the 
Commons stood where the Admin
istration Building now stands. 
When the present Commons was 
built during tho war, the name was 
carried ovor. Before it was turned 
into a cafeteria it. was occupied by 
tho Department of Mechanics. In 
1917 tliis department, moved over 
to the College of Industries and 
tho Commons was equipped as a 
cafetoria.
Tho arrangement tlien was to bo
only temporary and it then served 
three; hundred people daily. It. was 
later redecorated, and in 1927-2S 
the Commons served eight hun
dred students. The daily patrons 
now number about six hundred. 
As approximately seventy-five fac
ulty members use tho cafeteria 
every day, the new Faculty Din
ing Room hopes, by providing a 
pleasanter placo for the faculty in 
which to eat, to relieve some of 
this congestion.
Room Rc-furnlshed
Tho gray door to tho left of the 
main ontranco to tho Commons 
Cafeteria opens into a largo square 
ontranco hall whoso walls are 
painted a light greenish-gray. The 
woodwork is a dull green. Three 
or four broad steps lead to tho 
lounging room. The wall to tho 
loft Is lined with cupboards and 
deep seats. Ono cupboard Is to 
accommodate card tables and 
chairs, and tho smaller ones are to 
be used to store magazines and 
papers. Tliero are four deep seats 
ranged along the wall bot/weon the 
cupboards. Theso are to bo up
holstered in leather. On tho oppo
site side of the room French doors 
opon out onto a torraco racing 
Schonloy Park.

With a more completo aunouncomont of plans for Its 1034 annual, 
tho Thistle staff yostorday began 
a subscription campaign which is 
to have as ono of its foaturos a 
mid woole toa (lance and lloor show.
Tills tea dance, planned In co
operation with Delta Skull, junior 
class honorary, will be hold in 
Thlstlo Hall from 4 to l tomorrow 
afternoon. Admission will bo free 
to those who have a receipt show
ing that tholr Initial payment of 
$1.00 for a 1084 Thlstlo has boon 
made, whereas tho regular admis
sion will bo 35 cents a person 
with a limited presale ol tickets 
at 25 cents, Arrangements aro be*

A copy of the 1034 Thlstlo will

Scliieusoner, chairman of the dance

ranged to have Iflddio Mariner's 
Night Club furnish both the music 
and the floor show, tho latter to be
gin at 5 oclock.
According to Regis Joyco, editorin-chief, the staff Is sparing no ef
fort to make the 1934 Thistle one 
of tho boat annuals over published 
at Carnegie. For example, ho said 
that campus views will bo so seiecLod and of such a quality that 
they could quite suitably bo 
framed. Ho also expects to liavo 
superior photography evident 
throughout the book, for pictures 
this year will be taken in the finely 
equipped Parry Studio in the Wil
liam Penn Hotel rather than, as 
has been the custom in some in
stances, in any available class
room.
The Gallant Gaelen has been 
chosen as the motif for the art 
work, and the capering figuro of 
this mystical Scotsman will be 
found throughout the pages of the 
annual accompanied by the cadent 
Scotch verse which will he used to 
introduce each section. If present 
plans are completed, Joyco said, 
the book will be bound in genuine 
Scotch plaid._________________

rrHE SEASONS HARDEST TE8T IS NOW HI8TORY, Purduc'o Im 
prosslvo record hao been maintained, and the Carnegie goal line hao 
been crossed at last. Although I wao unable to attend the gamo 
myself, I have talked to a groat many who were there, and they were 
unanimous in stating It was one of the real thrillers of modern footbal. Sensational runs, brilliant passing, and smart football featured, 
which mU3t have been hair-raising after those two drab conservative 
games wo witnessed for tho past couplo of weeks.* * * * * *
CA11NEGI12 GIIIDDJCRS AND FANS SHOULD NOT BID DISCOURAGED 
by tho Iobb to the powerful Bollenmlcer. Purdue ariM one of the 
greatest teams in the country, having no equal when 11. comes to backs, 
and neither Carnegie Tech nor any othereaatern eleven han the tuff 
to stop the Kizer machine till ft BeaBon. The Tar tana should profit by 
tho i<amo and really Bet to work to flmaclc this Michigan State team. ******
SINCE TAKING OVER THE COACHING REINS AT PURDUE, Kizer 
has established a record that stands as a threat to that of the late 
Knutc Rockno. Kizer started in 1930, and in four years of competi
tion with the strongest teams In the country he has dropped but three 
contests, two of them being in the first year. Few coaches can claim 
a record better than that.******
PURDUE AND CARNEGIE TECH HAVE MET TWICE ON THE 
GRIDIRON, and both gameB have turned Into thriller. Tlila argues 
for a resigning of tho two teams for future years. The rivalry Is a 
natural one, tho two schools being the two leading football-playing 
technical schools in the country. This game should become a fixture 
in tho Stadium schedule, for Lafayette hasnt the population to draw 
from that Pittsburgh has. Pittsburgh fans should ho warned that they 
are liable to miss a thriller if they 'stay away from this game.
Georgia Tech is another natural rival with whom football relation
ships should he renewed. It Is my contention that people will go to 
seo football games if the program is an attractive one.* * * * * *
THE TARTANS HAVE ANOTHER TOUGH ASSIGNMENT this week 
when they face Michigan State at East Lansing. The mid-westerners 
have an impressive record to date, and anyone who takes them lightly 
is in for a sad afternoon. Recently they bowled over Syracuse to the 
tune of 27-3, and last Saturday they held Bo McMillans powerful Kan
sas State team to a 0-0 draw. They have lost only to Michigan, 20-6, 
and Carnegie will have to show everything theyve got to stand a 
chance of beating this outfit.* * * * * *
IN A MEETING OF BOXING PROSPECTS THURSDAY, Coach Ernie 
Sesto outlined his plans for intramural boxing this year. He empha
sized' the fact that all tho other large schools in the district success
fully put on intramural bouts and that there Is no reason why It couldn't 
be handled adequately here. Ho also emphasized that there would he 
no Injuries incurred. Twelve-ounce gloves will ho used and the rounds 
will last hut a minuto and a half in the preliminaries.
Mr. So&to has engaged Don Shaffer, Tony Sweet, and Jacques 
Croissant to help instruct hoys who would like to learn to box. He 
will liavo more definite plans for tho intramural tournament this 
week. It Is hoped that at least four or five boys from each house or 
hall will turn out to receive instruction. Boys not affiliated with any 
organization are also asked to come out.******
SCOTTY CHARLES, ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS STAFF, Is 
following In the family footsteps, l-lls father, John S. Charles, Sr., 
was the first sports editor of tho Tartan back In 1909. Mr. Charles 
was quite an athlete on bin own hook, being on several varsity teams. 
Ho captained Carnegie's first varsity track team and was also captain 
of tho first hockey team. One of his teammates on tho track squad was 
Guy Halforty, present track and cross-country chief.******
TRADITION, NOT PAST RECORDS, MAKES PITT-IRISII BATTLE 
Is my idea of a laugh, Nevertheless, tlmt very head appeared In the 
Pittsburgh ProBH lately. It evidently doesn't talco much to make a 
traditional battle around hero. Pitt and Notre Damn have clashed only 
seven times all told, with but four of them games coming off In mod
ern times. Tho other throe games were played way back before any
one over hoard of olthor one of the schools. Such a statement Is only 
a case of sour grapes, booauso tho defeats sufiorod by two colleges 
on tho preceding Saturday ruined the gate for the Notre Dnme-l'ltl.

however, showed that they have another really groat eleven in splto of

small stadium when Coach "Hooks 
Samples Carnegie Plebes tookthe 
field to do battle with Coach 
Millers Indiana Teachers team. 
They had a loud speaker system, 
too, and it was every bit as bad as 
the one in the Stadium.
Coach Sample, attired in the tra
ditional derby of a Carnegie Tech 
coach, directed his men from the 
sidelines, and watched his proteges 
beat the Teachers by 7 to 0 tune. 
The Indiana lads didnt have much 
to speak of in the way of football 
material, but they had a lot of 
fight and took advantage of the 
Plebes frequent boners to stay in 
the ball game.
The Plebes hp.d things all their 
own way in the first quarter, boot
ing several1 good opportunities, but 
in the second period a series of 
had breaks put them in a very bad 
hole. A long punt went over Quar
terback -Patts head and was 
grounded on the Carnegie 15-yard 
mark. Later the Teachers kicked 
out of bounds on the one-yard line. 
Still later Coach Millers boys 
pulled a fake, place ldck and car
ried the ball to the one-yard mark 
and first down. Here blie Plebes 
held for four downs and then 
kicked out of difficulty.
The Plebes scored their only 
touchdown in the last minute of 
play on a series of neatly executed 
passes. The scoring play was on 
a pass from Patt to Lorenz.
Halfbacks Kopczak and Lehman 
showed plenty of stuff, and tile 
line was a bit too powerful for 
their rivals.

These rules are as follows: all 
articles must be typed, or plainly

articles to campus news or inter

articles, as evidence of good faith 
and so that proper credit can be 
given.
The first holiday of the school 
year comes this Saturday, Ar

initial break in the regular 
school routine as no classes 
are scheduled for that day. 
Although this does not affect 
the majority of night students 
it will provide a holiday for 
those students that have Sat

The Student Directories are 
now on sale. They may be se

The Student Directory contains

It has been the cry for the lust 
few years that the machines in in
dustry were driving the common 
workman out of his job. Many 
claim that the machine, through 
volume production and automatic 
control, is responsible for the late 
lamented depression. "While this 
may be partly true, tlie responsi
bility of the machine is, at the 
most, only indirect. The machine 
in general has done more to help 
the workingman enjoy life than 
any other mass influence.''
Since the beginning of mechan
ized industry on a large scale in 
the early part of the last century 
the leisure time of the men work
ing in industries and trades has 
been just about doubled. A few 
decades ago, it was the accepted 
thing for men, and sometimes 
women, to work from fourteen to 
sixteen hours a day. These long 
hours gave the working people no 
time in which to enjoy themselves 
and left them worn out and spirit
less at the end of a days labor. 
The present standard eight hour 
working day allows the workers 
ample time to spend in any form 
of amusement they may choose, 
from digging in a garden to dig
ging up a golf course.
The machine has not only pro
vided man with spare time, it has 
also been the essential factor in 
giving him most of the ordinary 
comforts of civilized life.
If the critics of the mechanical 
age would consider for a while the 
enormous benefits they have de
rived from this era, they would 
possibly be more ready to help 
control the machine than to destroy it.________________________________
The Night College of Industries 
held its first social function of the 
year, the election smoker, in the 
Gymnasium auditorium on Satur
day, October 2S. The Kiltie Band 
opened the meeting with several 
numbers, after which three reels 
of comic movies were shown. Mr. 
Simpson, retiring president of the 
College of Industries, then intro
duced Mr. A. J. Lois, president of 
the Night Student Council for this 
year.
The next event of the evening 
was the election of officers. Mr. 
Simpson declared the chair open 
for nominations which were re
ceived and voted upon by secret 
ballot. The results of the election 
were as follows: Messrs. C. A.
Blochinger, F. A. Kolsun, L. J. 
Becker and H. B. Stone were 
elected president, vice president, 
secretary and treasurer, respec
tively.
The election was followed by 
boxing bouts and a wrestling 
match which were well received by 
the audience. At the conclusion 
of the meeting, a delicious lunch 
was served and everyone left wellsatisfied.

Spooks, goblins and cider were 
the predominant features of the 
Phi Nu costume dance on Satur
day, October 28. Old colonial pa
triots, Spaniards, pirates, witches 
-all were resurrected for the oc
casion. Little girls in pig-tails, 
bowery-touglis, clowns, Irish las
sies, Scotch-Higlilanders, and many 
others of questionable identity 
made their appearance. Prizes 
were awarded for different types of 
costumes.
The Colonial Studios on M,urray 
avenue made a most attractive and 
satisfactory setting for such an af
fair, and profuse decorations of an 
appropriate nature heightened 
the natural charm of the rooms. 
They made an ideal setting for a 
grand party, with fine music, a de
licious lunch and much fun aild 
hilarity for everyone.
This affair was an auspicious be
ginning for what is to be an active 
year for Phi Nu. Members should 
now reserve Saturday, November 
18 for the next event. On this 
evening there will be a new and 
novel type of stag party that will 
take its place among the outstand
ing social affairs of the year.

John Peter Zenger and William Randolph Hearst,
Two hundred years ago a Colonial .jury, with the eloquent 
plea oJ! Alexander Hamilton still in its ears, retired to con
sider the case of one John Peter Zenger, publisher, charged 
with libel.
Zenger, German-born in 1680, had entered the printing bus
iness after coming to this country in 1700. He established the 
New York Weekly Journal in 1733 and made it the organ of 
the popular party in this country. His blistering attacks on the 
administration of Colonial government soon brought his arrest 
on a charge of libel. He. languished in prison for eight months 
before friends employed Hamilton to defend him. The defense 
admitted the publishing but maintained that since it were true, 
there was no libel.
Hamilton was well aware of the importance of the case 
when he said: I make no doubt . . . you will lay a noble foun
dation for securing to ourselves and our posterity that to which, 
nature and the laws of our country have given us a right 
the liberty both of exposing and opposing arbitrary power by 
speaking and writing truth. The jury, imbued with popular 
opinion, returned a verdict of not guilty. The decision has been 
said to mark the establishment oi! the free press in America.
The Constitution later provided for freedom of spcech and 
the press in the First Amendment.
This principle has been jealously guarded since then and 
wisely so, perhaps, when one considers the predicament of the 
press in many foreign countries.- Government control seems to 
be the rule rather than the exception. Yet, somehow, wo find 
ourselves unable to become excited when William Randolph 
Hcarst thunders about the threat of control in this country. 
Hearst professes to see in the licensing feature of the National 
Recovery Act a menace to free press. It is regrettable that the 
Administration should have laid itself open to this underhanded 
method of attack of the NRA by not expressly exempting the 
press from licensing provisions. This one feature appears to 
have boon seized upon by everyone intent on sniping at the 
NRA.
A licensed pross in this country is moro fancied than a 
possibility and this Hearst well knows. He has, first of all, the 
constitutional guaranteo which no licenso can abrogate. He has, 
too, promise of NRA leaders, including Donald Richardson, 
general counsel, who says "Those who argue that newspapers 
might bo licensed under tho NRA aro simply creating a hobgob
lin and then screaming at it. Tho licensing power was incor
porated bocauHQ many believed such power must bo available to 
provont cheaters and ehisolors from destroying co-opcrativo 
business agreements, Tho idea that any .effort would bo made 
to apply this provision to 'newspapers, and to licenso their pub
lication, :is preposterous.
Wo wish Uenrsl; would confino his attacks to somothing 
moro tangible. Or perhaps he's not sure yet of tho extent to 
which the public has subscribed to the Now Deal and. is pro
ceeding slowly.
From John Potor Zongor to William Randolph Hearst is a 
long stop and wo fail to see any similarity between Zengor :fl{: 
ing foi* a Iroo press and Hearst in the same role. In fact, wo 
find slightly amusing tho picture ol! Hearst in the robes of selfstyled defender of J'roo press.
/]. Trip for the Killies and Cheer Leaders
Each year Carnegie's Kiltie Band and cheer-leading squad 
make new friends for the school. The fame of tho Kilties has 
traveled as far as the name Carnegie is known. In picturesque 
attire and snappy formation, they never fail to bring applause. 
The cheer-leaders have helped to maintain Tartan traditions oflight even in the face of hopeless odds. Certainly football 
has seen no more stirring sight than that of a Carnegie cheering 
section thundering a plca of Fight, Team, Fight as the Scots 
make a goal-line: stand.
This years band and cheering squad are making tradition, 
The band, we think, has never been so impressive as it has been 
this year. Intricate formations, run off smoothly, attest to hours 
of drill. Color stunts and the like evidence a desire to make 
the name Carnegie stand for the best in college bands.
The cheer-leaders, too, have been working over-time this 
year. They have sponsored a number of Pep Rallies during 
the season and at the games have featured card stunts and new 
cheer formations, all indicative of long rehearsal periods.
Plans are now being made for a pre-Pitt game rally on the 
campus Wednesday, November 29, at 11:30.
Certainly the band and squad are deserving of commenda
tion for their performances and have richly earned some re
ward. We suggest that some way be found to make possible 
an out-of-town trip this year.
An Interesting proposal was
made last Miminor, in a magazine
article, by .Jobn Erskine, best
known as the author of "The Pri
vate Life of Helen of Troy, but in 
bis spare time professor of English 
n a prominent American Univer
sity.
In a general discussion of tlie 
college education" which is being 
meted out to so many thousands of 
American youths, Professor ErskJne proposed that at Ur end of the 
students' second year in college an 
exhaustive examination should be 
set them. Those falling to obtain
certain standard should at once 
bo granted a degree and dismissed 
from the university. Their more 
clever companions should bo per
mitted to continue their studies'for
further period of two years, after 
which they should bo granted ex
actly the same degree as tho soph
omore graduates.
The chief advantage of such a 
system, 'the Professor points out, 
would be that the smaller size of 
the more advanced classes would 
'esult in greater benefit to those 
participating in them. The differ
ence in the attainments of tho two 
groups of graduates would be no 
more marked than that to be seen 
between the more and the less 
clever members of a graduating 
class today!
This suggestion appears to us 
exceedingly unique. Apart from 
the advantages cited by its author 
It is noteworthy in that it recogIzes the fact that an education 
and not a collltch degree" should 
be the aim of the student.
Such a system would not be of 
any value in a technical or medical 
Bchool, but in a faculty where the 
imparting of culture or the prepa'ation of the students for citizen
ship is the avowed aim and where 
the curriculum not infrecpiently in
cludes such Items as tap-dancing, 
it might be introduced to advant
age.McGill Daily.
ON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will Lnndsberg
Ask any Nazi whether Germany 
doslrea war and your answer will 
bo an emphatic denial.
Ask any other European about 
tho prospect of a war and your an
swer will be an omphalic alllrmation. Undoubtedly, ho will loll 
you, there will he a war. Tho ques
tion is no longer If but when. Pes
simistically and unenthusiastically, 
Europeans accept tho fact. Only 
the date remains to bo (lxod.
Yet in Germany, Hitler Insists 
that (he Reich desires peace. He 
sounds rather convincing, too, 
when ho declares that all the load
ers of tho Third Relcli having boon 
in the last war, know all its hor
rors and miseries, and would do 
anything to prevent their recur
rences. But the National Socialist 
Party has made certain major 
pledges which would necessitate 
going to war to fulfill. Probably 
tho most threatening is union with 
Austria. Prance and her allies 
stand in the way and undoubtedly 
would not hesitate to resort to 
force to prevent it. Some thirty 
million Germans are living outside
the .borders of Germany, mainly in 
tho states newly created by the 
war. Hitler is determined tha 
those bo reunited with tho Fathorland, and as strongly as ho doslros 
tills, Poland and Czechoslovakia 
oppose it. Outwardly. Hitler ha 
adopted tho Kaiser's old program 
for carving out now areas for Gor

Eastern Europe. Thoro Is as lit (1

his determination as there Is that

It will come as soon as Germany,

youth is told in an anonymous ariclo entitled Confessions of a 
College Teacher" in the current is
sue of Scribner's.
When he entered the teaching 
profession as a young idealist burnng with the desire to malco stu
dents appreciate the beauties of 
English literature, the professor 
making the confession was shocked 
;o And on examination of test pa
pers written in his class that 
Hamlet was the son of King Lear, 
that "Wyatt and Surrey did not 
write poetry, they wroto sonots, 
and that Coleridge wrote a beauti

Ho tried again and again to And 
some evidences of intelligence in 
his students but finally had to give 
up. Ho then bocamo bardbollod 
and decided that if ho could not 
teach students anything ho at. least; 
would make them, uncomfortable. 
But ho gave this up when the dean 
old him ho would have to resign 
localise no one would enroll in his 
classes. So ho started giving

most popular toacher on tho cam

mind of tho nation. From, tho low
est German schools up through the 
ranks of the party, the mind of 
Germany is being molded to con
form to and approve of the poli
cies of - the Hitler regime. 
Neitsches philosophy of the Super
man has been popularized. His 
'Libido Potendithe lust for 
power, and the Iielden Idee 
the Hero Idea, have been reviv
ed and given full sanction.
Obviously, tills is not the sort of 
thing that can be straightened out 
at conferences. Each group knows 
definitely what it wants and will 
accept no compromise. Germany 
might not object to being given a 
part of what she claims is hers 
anyway, but its quite implausible 
to think that France, for instance, 
anight give her Alsace-Lorraine 
just to keep her satisfied. The sit
uation isnt vague or indefinite. 
Both factions have clearly shown 
their policies and the courses they 
intend to pursue. Conditions becamo a bit more tense the other 
week when Germany, in what 
Franco considers the gravest 
news In twenty years, withdrew 
from tho League ol' Nations. When 
the moral flbor of an entiro nation

point, of view, when the solemn, 
rigid beliefs of an entire 1 people 
resolve themselves about militar
istic tendencies  then all the 
Leagues of Nations, Kellogg Peace 
Pacts and such can take tholr one
way tickets to oblivion.
Assuming, then, that a war will 
occur, what could possibly result 
from it? Regardless of the out
come, conditions will he no more 
relieved when it is over. Should 
Germany triumph, she will acquire 
what she desires and all the other 
nations will chafe and grumble at 
the unbalance of power in Europe. 
Should Germany be defeated, what 
could possibly be done to her? 
Punishing her further would cer
tainly do no good. She wil never 
be content disunited and defeat 
will only mean continued disunity. 
Obviously, war is not the solution. 
Is there no other?

er who saw the game that the Skibos might not 
just as well have had a scoreless tie. Carter 
happened to pick an alley on that kickoff 
something that doesnt happen once in a hundred 
times.
Theres one gratifying thing that you can be 
sure of., The boys fought every bit as tyard 
against the Boilermakers as they did in the N. D. 
game. And that, if you remember, was plenty. 
The team really "put out for the old Plaid last 
week and thats about all we can ask. There's 
plenty of good, healthy respect for Carnegie 
spirit floating around Lafayette at this time.
Joe Mihm's run for our score was alone worth 
the trip. To see 210-pound Joesy pick a Purdue 
pass out of the ozone, speed down the sidelines 
like a bonafide sprinter and even elude a tackier 
before scoring, was a sight which will long re
main in our memory. It wouldn't be fair to pick 
out any Skibo player as outstanding. To us, how
ever, the terrific beating that little Sputzie Terrebus took from the giant Purdue backs seems 
to deserve special comment.
We lost to a great teameasily one of the 
best in the country. The manner in which the 
gang went down to defeat only serves to 
strengthen our conviction as to the outcome of 
that Thanksgiving Day game.

FURDUE
A beautiful school, deep in tradition and boast
ing a curriculum of well-temperered education 
and enjoyment . . . The famous Hoosier hospi
tality is nowhere better than in little West La
fayette . . . They have a pleasant way of beat
ing you and making you like it . . . The game 
with Carnegie was THE game of the local sea
son.
Every store, dorm and fraternity house was 
decorated with Plaid and Beat Carnegie signs 
. . . Its a sensation that we city collegians have 
never known . . . The entire town is back of 
the team . . . Purdue home games dont draw 
well due to the scant population . . . the 18,000 
in the picturesque Ross-Aid. Stadium was a big I 
crowd. I* * * * \
YE BALLE I
If you want to see the soldier boys all dressed | 
up, and at the same time enjoy some really good 
dance music, dont forget the annual Military 
Ball which is booked for this Friday in the Hall. 
Art Kassel, who has been engaged to furnish the 
music, is very well known and liked around Chi
cago. We dont remember of his band ever being 
here in town before. The affair should afford some 
indication as to how the other big dances will 
go over this year.

AT HOME LAST SATURDAY
The P. C. W. girls put one. over on the faculty 
and tossed a secret dance at a local hotel. About 
eight of the old Carnegie guard managed to make 
it.
Old Home Week was observed in the girls (or 
is it women's) dorms on this same evening. In 
Forbes Hall for example, what started out to he 
a nice quiet evening at home, ended up in a 
more or less informal melee. The Strike-MePinks got a big sendoff when Rosemary Carver 
(in the absence of the Big Bad Wolf led Harry 
(No Dates) Hower onto the scene of action.
Others mixed up in the rumpus were Esther
Brumbaugh, and Dick Blair, John Dawson and 
Julia Hubbard, Larry Dickson and Philly Mc
Clure, Earl Moyles and Marian Kremer and John 
Harvey with Virginia Yohe.

..yes I like that word 
about cigarettes
"When I think of milder ciga
rettes nowadays, I always think of 
Chesterfields.
"Because Chesterfields are milder. 
Theyve got plenty of faste and aroma 
to them but theyve got mildness too! 
"I smoke Chesterfields all day long
when Im working and when Im 
not, and theres no time when a 
Chesterfield doesnt taste milder 
and better.
"Ill put in a good word any time 
for a cigarette like Chesterfields 
theyre mild and yet they Satisfy.
