MUSICAL CLUBS HAVE 
BIG CONCERT SCHEDULE
After a week of rest following the 
vigorous two weeks preceading the 
Home Concert, the Musical Clubs are 
entering upon a period of four weeks 
in which nine concerts will be given. 
A trip to New Castle and Youngs
town will be taken next Thursday 
and Friday, the eleventh and twelfth. 
Each city plans to have a capacity 
house and the clubs will have to pre
sent their best efforts as the concert 
was given to us in preference to Col
gate, Western Reserve and Cornell.
Friday night of this week the clubs 
go to Oakmont for a concert. The 
entire club will make this trip and

ALL COMPANIES WILL 
DRILL AS ONE REGIMENT
Plans for united drill of all com
panies are progressing rapidly. Mr. 
OHara says that regimental drills 
will start probably on April 8. Drill 
will be held from 3:30 to 5 p. m., and 
will include all companies except De
sign. On Monday afternoons the De
sign company will drill with the Sci
ence and Industries companies, on 
other days the Design company will 
drill apart from the rest of the schools.
SCIENCE ASSEMBLY MADE 
ELIERTON CANDIDATE
Mr. Vogel Talks on Engineer
ing Prospects in Asia
At the Science Assembly held from 
4:30 to 5:00 last Thursday, George 
.Ellerton' was elected from a group of 
.six nominees as the Science candidate 
for President of the Central Council. 
When the other three schools have 
elected their candidates, a final selec
tion between the-four will be made by 
the present Student Council.
Aside from that election the chief 
business of the Assembly was to hear 
.-a talk by Mr. J. H. Vogel on Engi
neering Prospects' in the Oirent. Mr. 
"Vogel left a challenge for any man 
-who has something more than skill 
and experience to come to Asia. 
There he will have almost endless op
portunity to develop his ingeunity, for 
the Oriental problems are far from 
commonplace. Their mines are prac
tically untouched, and the work of 
opening the mines and installing ma
chinery is tremendous. Their prob
lems of sanitation, and particularly 
sewage disposal, are like no other in 
the world. The -workmen an American 
engineer would have to deal with are 
far different from those in the U. S., 
and he would have to know how to win 
liis men to a stretch of twenty-four 
liours work if that should be neces-sary, as it might well be if the task 
-were to line a concrete tank in moist 
ground with inadequate mixing facil
ities.
These difficulties1 and the additional 
one of learning the language are real 
enough, but should be an attraction 
rather than a hindrance to the man 
with more than skill and experience. 
Mr. Vogel could place men now, or 
even better after the war, and he urged 
every man to keep in touch with the 
situation through the magazine The 
Asia.
CALL FOR CANDIDATES 
FOR INTER-SCHOOL MEET
Coach Eyman announces Friday. 
April 26, as the date for the annual 
Inter-School Track Meet. Last year 
the meet opened the eyes of both the 
coaches and student body by bringing 
out several men who have since de
veloped into the best material. Last 
year Heavy Ellerton broke the 
Tech record for the shot put and 
Lingenfelser for the first time demon
strated his ability at the dashes.
Every fellow on the campus should 
get out and loosen up. Many more 
track candidates are needed and this 
will be an opportunity for every man 
to try himself out. Heretofore Sci
ence has been copping the first place 
regularly and it is up to the men 
from Industries and Design to be out 
to stop this winning streak. All 
Science men should likewise be out 
to defend the title.
President Wilson and Secretary of 
War Baker have given their opinion 
on the advantages derived from col
legiate sports. Here is an opportun 
ity for each and every male student 
of Tech to get out and get his share 
of this valuable experience, incident
ally helping his school.
ENLISTED MEN AT TECH 
OPEN ATHLETIC SEASON
A baseball league for enlisted men 
enrolled at Carnegie Tech has formally 
opened its season. There are five 
teams in the league and twilight games 
will be played daily with two contests 
each Saturday afternoon.
Tech Field was given over to the 
soldier players last Saturday for an 
extended practice session. Some of 
the men showed unusual ability, and 
signs of having had lots of experience 
on the diamond before they decided 
to do their share for Uncle Sam.
It is expected that the league will 
furnish plenty of recreation for the 
soldiers, but at the same time plans 
are being made for military track 
meets with such events as grenade 
and bomb throwing. There the sol
diers will compete among themselves 
and will also send a team against the 
regular students at Tech.

MILITARY BALL TO HAVE 
VARIETY OF AMUSEMENTS
Plans for the Military Ball in the 
Hotel Schenley Bull Room April ID. 
are nearing completion. Day students 
attending are required to be in uni
form. but night men are not. Music 
will be in charge of George McNewry 
with.an orchestra of eight pieces. 
There will be a grand march begin
ning promptly at nine o'clock, and 
dancing will continue until two. There 
1 be entertainment for those not 
dancing in the form of bridge, five 
hundred, or other card games. Re
freshments have been promised, but 
those hints of a cabaret are still be
ing left dark.
All the proceeds of the affair are 
*to be turned over immediuiteljy ' to 
the Tech Red Cross Auxiliary, and 
will be used to buy a cutting machine 
and to pay for yarn. Assessment is 
.$1.50 per couple. The whole affair 
is to have a military flavor, for in ad
dition to the uniforms of the students, 
the dance is receiving the support of 
the military authorities and both 
Colonel Brooks and Major Lyle will 
probably be there.
Named for His Friend
MAYOR BABCOCK DELIVERS AN ADDRESS
ANNUAL BAND CONCERT 
FOLLOWED BY DANCE
The annual Band Concert and Dance 
was given' in the Union last Thursday 
evening. The concert began at 8 
oclock, and the band presented a re
markably good program for an hour. 
The dance following was informal, 
and although the crowd was small, 
the music was good and the crowd en
joyed themselves.
Sully and his men deserve more 
credit than they receive for the work 
they do. Very few students realize the 
amount of time and work given by the 
band men, and what comparatively 
small reward they receive for their 
services. The dedication ceremonies 
yesterday would not have been half so 
impressive if it had not been for the 
band.
R. 0. T. C. RUMORS 
SHOWN UNFOUNDED
There are some men who seem to 
be worrying for fear that Tech has 
R. O T. Cnot received her designation as an 
Major Lyle announced to a Tartan 
representative on Monday, that Tech 
has been appointed an R. O. T. C. 
and that all rumors to the contrary 
are unfounded.
HAND GRENADES
ORDERED FOR MINNESOTA
Hand grenades will be delivered 
this week for the cadets. A class of 
hand grenade throwing will be con
ducted as soon as the weather per
mits. The grenades are of the same 
size and weight as those used iii the 
regular United States army canton
ments.University of Minnesota.
GROWING DEFINITE
The dedication of the Langley Laboratory oi Aeronautics was 
accomplished yesterday afternoon .with an historical address by Dr. 
Brashear, a talk by Mayor Babcock, and the actual words of dedica
tion by Dr. Iiamerschlag. The Design School campus was crowded 
with visitors, and the feature of the afternoon was an exhibition for 
them of oneof the aeroplanes which will be used in the new labora
tory. The buzz of the propellers as the soldiers held back the 
straining machine caused quite a stir of excitement.
The campus was arranged by having the speakers platform 011 
the north side of the new building facing the Design lawn, with 
bleachers for the spectators on either side of it. The enlisted men 
taking courses at Tech were drawn -.ip in front of the speakers, but 
slightly to one side, and the regular students slightly to the other 
side. A guard of honor consisting of twenty men from each com
pany were posted with arms on the roof of the building.
By the time President Hamcrschlag called the assembly to order, 
the whole campus was crowded with spectators. The dedication pro
gram was opened with a prayer by Dr. Travis. Briefly, then, Dr. 
Iiamerschlag introduced our Uncle John, who was to talk about 
his association with Professor Langley. In spite of his age, Dr. Brashears voice was strong enough to carry over the whole lawn, and 
as an additional evidence of his wonderful vitality he told of coming 
from a days work helping Uncle Sam to whip the Hun.
In his talk Dr. Brashear told how Professor Langley conceived 
the idea of enteringupon, the study of aeronautics after hearing a 
paper read on the subject at the American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science. The paper hold ideas which at tlio time seemed 
hardly scientific, but nevertheless impressed Professor Langley. / lie 
started out his work'with Dr. Brashear here in Pittsburgh, and ob 
tained the moneynecessary for his experiments from William Thaw, 
another Pittsburgher who did much for education and improvement 
of humanity. Assisting during part of the experimenting in this city 
was 'William Hartman, who has since been associated with Tech. 
The experiments ranged from the crudest, with little rubber band 
models, up to the more elaborate, with fully equipped machines. 
During his work, Professor Langley went to the Smithsonian Insti
tute, and after that, conducted his experiments along the banks of the 
Potomac River. His final experiment was not a success because of the 
inefficiency of his engine. The newspapers took up his failure and 
ridiculed him so violently that Professor Langley felt it keenly, and 
Dr. Brashear said that he really died with a broken heart. Yet Pro
fessor Langley, in a statement which Dr. Brashear quoted, said that 
he felt he had, in spite of his apparent failure, successfully completed 
that part of the work for which he had been called. That he was 
correct and his critics wrong was shown only too forcefully just a few 
years ago when Professor Langelys original aeroplane, equipped 
with, a modern gasoline motor, was able to fly as successfully as any 
of the machines of today.
Following Dr. Brashear, Mayor Babcock was introduced and 
spoke briefly of what the dedication meant to Pittsburgh. In the first 
place, the laboratory wa$ built in the record time of twenty-eight 
daystwenty-three working daysby a firm of Pittsburgh con
tractors who were supplied with structural steel by another Pitts
burgh firm. The dedication, the mayor said, is an evidence of the re
markable share which the city has in industrial war work, all of her 
laborers being in reality soldiers. In the second place, the new build
ing is an evidence of the work which Pittsburgh is doing to train men 
already in the army for special service, for before many days the 
building will allow Tech to engage in an increased amount of that 
very work.
Finally President Iiamerschlag said the final words of dedication, 
and invited all the audience to remain to see the inside of the build
ing. It was during his talk that the two aeroplanes were wheeled 
on the lawn between the enlisted men and the students, and the 
motor of one was started with a tremendous roar. The dedication 
closed with the bands playing The Star-Spangled Banner, the 
guard of honor on the roof coming to present arms.
Following the exercises the enlisted men and the students 
paraded out 'W'oodlawn avenue and back again, and were then dis
missed.
For those men who are uncertain 
as to the prospects for summer school, 
it may be said that there will be sum
mer courses. Mr. OHara stated early 
this week that general courses will 
be offered this summer. These classes 
will deal with plebe and sophomore 
studies largely, although practically 
any subject may be taken providing 
there are at least eight men enrolled 
to take this subject. No subject will 
be taught to a class of less than eight 
men.
This quarter of the years work will 
start July 5th and will continue until 
the latter part of September. In the 
Fall the new plan of four quarters a 
year will go into effect. Each year 
will be divided into Four quarters 
the Fall quarter, Winter quarter, 
Spring quarter and Summer quarter. 
Each quarter will be complete In It
self and will be treated as a semes
ter Is now treated. It will therefore 
be possible for a student, to omit any, 
quarter and to continue his work 
without further lose.
This plan, of four quarters a year 
Is not essentially a war measure. It 
is to be permanent: In fact, the sum 
mer term this year will not bo as 
complote as the summer courses are 
to be In future years.
It was announced early this week 
that the proposed summer training 
camp will, in all probability, not bo 
established this year at Tech.
In place of the proposed camp, how
ever, a number of Tech men may be 
offered the privilege of being sent to 
an officers training camp. This af
fords Tech men of draft age an op
portunity of securing a commission. 
The men showing the most, aptitude 
for military work will be selected for 
this honor.
FIRE EXCITEMENT ON 
TECH FIELD FRIDAY
BASEBALL MATERIAL 
IS STILL UNTRIED
Little progress In baseball affairs 
was made during the past week. Coach 
McCulloch has boen unable to mak;o 
any definite estimation of the material 
as so much-of It Is new and ho was 
further hamperod by being unable to 
attend practice Friday and Saturday.
Captain Jimmy Doherty was a vic
tim of la grippe last week and was 
therefore incapable of taking up the 
work during the absence of theconc.h. 
He had rounded back Into condition 
again and will be out leading the squad 
again this week.
"Cory .Cretzler is steadily improv
ing his work on the mound. Ho has 
confined himself almost entirely to the 
use of a straight ball, but his speed 
has been such as to baffle most of the 
batters who face him. Lynn, the other 
pitching candidate, was not out for 
practice regularly. Coach McCulloch 
will undoubtedly experience much dif
ficulty in developing a staff of reliable 
hurlers, but as there are no trips and 
the games are fairly well scattered, a 
couple of first class men can readily 
-handle this department.
Last Friday afternoon the process ot 
(.loaning up Tech, FI old resulted In 
considerable excitement. Manager Byman and Bert" Munhall, with several 
unenthuslastlc assistants, raked to
gether a pile of rubbish and were pro
ceeding with a bonfire when the weeds 
along the Hillside took a notion to burn, 
too. By the time the fire reached the 
wall at the top of the hill, it; had also 
reached a second pile of rubbish along 
the wall, which smoked like a good 
fellowsaid smoke threatening nighbors with heart-lallure. Some timor
ous person sent In an alarm and tho 
nglnes came, slap-bang! Meanwhile, 
the aforementioned neighbors mado 
valiant efforts to subdue the raging 
smolder with a garden hose. Botween. 
the engines and the garden hose there 
was no extensive loss of life.
BASEBALL SCHEDULE 
CAUSING MUCH WORRY
The difficulties in arranging satis
factory sport schedules apparently 
never will end. After Manager Todd 
had worked up a fairly good card 
considering the circumstances, vari
ous contingencies have arisen that 
tore this to pieces. To cap the cli
max Waynesburg College cancelled 
its baseball game. Athletic Mana
ger Eyman was notified of this dur
ing the past week, the reason given 
being the inadequate response to the 
call for candidates.
A telegram was received Monday 
from Colgate asking for a game here 
in Pittsburgh. It is possible that an 
agreement may be reached as this 
game would do much to strengthen 
the schedule.
Five baseball teams of the various 
service units stationed at Tech have 
been entered Into a Service League, 
Coach McCulloch Is postponing an
nouncing a definite schedule for the 
league until final arrangements are, 
made for the dinner hour of the Ra
dio detachments which are now eat
ing at six-fhlrty every evening.
DRAMA STUDENTS PLAY 
ENJOYABLE DOUBLE BILL
At a matinee performance in the 
Little Theater of Iho School of Ap
plied Design, last Thursday afternoon, 
two interesting plays were produced.
The first was Lone-some-like, 
a one act-play directed by Mr. Wliltford Kane, who lately put on the pro
duction of I-Iindle Wakes, at the Pitt 
Theater. Miss Alicia Guthrie as1 the 
old lady around whim the story of the 
play centers, did a very good piece of 
acting. If Miss Guthrie is not careful 
she will find herself another Emma 
Dunn; she does character old women 
so well that she wont be able to get 
away from parts of that variety.
Bishop I. Dickinson, as the poor, 
lonesome-llke lad, was good, as a 
young man of liisappearance naturally 
would be in a part so sympathetic as 
this. He fits the character very well 
and really makes the most of the part, 
the first one of importance that he has 
undertaken here.
Miss Mary Ricards as the factorygirl who drops in to help out, ap
peared in a part very different from 
those in which one lias been accus
tomed to see her. But she does just 
as interesting work with her lialr 
pulled back and lines in her face 
as she does as a sweet young thing, 
or a boy. She was more like herself 
in the bit of pantomime by the door as 
the young curate (Mr. Mulligan) left 
but lie didnt seem to quite play up to 
her In this instance, although the rest 
of his characterization was well done 
and shows his usual thoroughness.
The play art, a whole was not quite 
so well done as might bo wished; but 
the fey rough spots will bo eliminated 
by the tnmo the next performance Is 
given, as this was In reality a public 
dress* rehearsal, the actors virtually 
"feeling their way during the entire 
play, although the audience did not 
seem to realize the fact.

AERONAUTICS LABORATORY
The Langley Laboratory oif Aeronautics was rather solemnly 
and appropriately dedicated yesterday afternoon. Without referring 
to the alliterative sound of the title, it seems especially fitting that 
Professor Langleys name should have been coupled with that of 
the new building. Although he was never connected with the Insti
tute during his lifetime, still it was in this city that Professor Lang
ley made his first attempt to solve the aviation problem, and while 
here he was the close friend of our friend, Dr. Brashear.
Professor Langley was a pioneer in the aviation field. Al
though he was not the most successful pioneer, still his gliders and 
planes were corrcct, and the machine which he used is being repro
duced with few variations today. The story is told of one trial flight 
with gliders among the sand hills along the Potomac River; the flight 
was more successful than, anticipated and landed Professor Langley, 
gliders and all, in the middle of the river. The fact that his machine 
failed only because of a poor engine was demonstrated within tlie 
last few years by showing that his plane was well able to fly when 
propelled by a modern motor.
Must as Professor Langley was a pioneer with the flying ma
chine, so this new laboratory is a pioneer venture in the science ol! 
aeronautics. It lias been no great surprise that the country has wait
ed for Tech to start such a thing. Other schools in the U. S. have and 
will follow with the sincere flattery of imitation, but in this as in 
many other things Carnegie has been the pioneer. This peculiar feat 
ol! planning, designing and building the laboratory all within the 
short space of a few weeks speaks wonders Tor the incentive and the 
ability ol' the men in charge. It is a. feat destined to make Tech even 
more popular with the 'War Department -when Tech with her nine 
war courses and many enlisted men in training is already ranked with 
the best. The. men from the. Aeroplane Mechanics Course now here 
were prominent in the dedication.
II; is surely fitting that a pioneer laboratory should be named 
a liter a. pioneer experimenter.
THIRD LIBERTY LOAN
The ('lover,ninenl; is about; to launch its third Liberty Loan drive 
on the anniversary oil America's entrance into the war. Practically 
everything that can be said about the third loan has already been 
said about the first two, except thisthe great drive on the Western 
Front brings a situation more critical than ever, a need greater than 
ever, a cause more worthy than over. An American army is to be 
actually in the great fight. It is up to us to support them I
The students and faculty have subscribed their bit towards the 
first two loans, and particularly the second. With the same amount 
of effort the success which followed that drive before ought to be 
repeated and surpassed now.

ful than had been expected. In a first 
production involving so many people, 
some mishaps are naturally expected, 
but in this case Mr. Viehman had 
everything so carefully arranged that 
the play proceeded without a liitcli, 
His Morris dance with Miss Mary

THE FORD FLEET
(From the New York World.)
American mechanismsdesigned 
by American engineers, constructed 
by American workers and operated 
by American fightersare going to 
win the war on land, in the water 
and in the air. 
The Eagle is one of two particular 
fighting devices which are so en
grossing Mr. Fords attention at 
present that he is working harder 
and putting in longer hours than any 
of the 10,000 employes of his con
cern.
Without going too deeply into de
tails as-to the construction of these 
boats, it is permissible to say that 
they are 200 feet long, 25%, feet 
wide, draw S feet of water, carry 5- 
inch guns, are equipped with sub
marine detectors that can spot the 
enemy's U-boats more than a mile 
away, have devices for dropping 
depth bombs and are expected to do 
great execution.
Yet they are to be turned out. (bit; 
as they are) in the same standard
ized, systematized fashion as the lit 
tie pleasure cars which made Mr 
Fords name known Throughout the 
world. He described yesterday one 
of the buildings along the Rouge 
river, at Detroit, where the Eagle* 
are now under construction.
"This is 300 feet wide and 1,S00 
feet loiig, Mr. Ford said. It has 
three sets of rails, along which the 
Eagles progress from the beginning 
of their assembling until they are 
complete. At he end of the trades 
they take to the water, and by that 
time they are a finished product, ful
ly equipped armed and supplied 
and with their crews aboard.
We have orders for 100 of these 
boats, but were prepared to build 
1,000 if they are needed, Mr. Ford 
said. Construction will go on at 
Rouge river until the weather is too 
cold next fall, and by that time the 
plant in the jersey meadows will be 
in operation.
Mr. Fords other pet war machine 
is the two-man tank. This is not 
his own idea he wanted it under
stood. It was the conception of 
army men, just as the Eagle was the 
outgrowth of navy ideas. But he has 
built one of the small tanks for ex
perimental purposes, and he knows 
what it will do.
"The simplest thing possible! he 
said enthusiastically. Its merely a 
litle affair of sheet steel, armorplated, with two of our ordinary 20- 
horsepower motors, driving truck 
worm-gears, with caterpillar traction.
A LASTING PEACE
The essential principles that must 
underlie peace, as stated by Presi
dent Wilson, should be constantly 
kept in mind. They show the great
ness and unselfishness and justice 
of Americas war. aims. Briefly they 
are:
(1) The final settlement of this 
war must be based upon essential 
justice and each particular case so 
adjusted as will most likely bring a 
permanent peace.
(2) Peoples and Provinces are not 
to be bartered about as if they were 
mere chattels and pawns in a game.
(3) Every territorial settlement 
must, be made in the interest of and 
for the benefit of the population con
cerned and not by way of compro
mising claims of rival Stated.
(4) National aspirations must be 
accorded all the satisfaction possiDie, without introducing new or per
petuating old elements of discord.

UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS
As a stimulus toward better work

the University of Illinois has adopt 
ed a system whereby students found 
delinquent in seventy-five per cent

ter entirely. By vote of the council 
of administration, seventy-eight, stu
dents have just been dropped for

FLAG OF HONOR
Banners Will Fly in Every 
Community in Nation if 
McAdoo Gets Wish
WOMEN WAKE LARGE SILK 
ONES FOR AMERICAN CITIES
Washington Turns Out to Watch 
Hoisting of First Sample 
at the Capital
The enthusiasm which greeted the 
flying of a sample of the Third Liber
ty Loan Honor Flag in Washington a 
week or more ago was but the fore
taste of the zest which will attend a 
series of similar flag raisings all over 
the United States when the real 
Honor Flags are raised by the com
munities which will have earned the 
right to fly them by subscribing their 
quota to the loan.
Patriotic addresses by big men of 
the communities, playlets by the 
school children, entertainments by 
church or amateur dramatic societies, 
parades by lodgesthese are some of 
tho ceremonies planned to attend the 
raising of the flags in the various 
units.
Tho Liberty Loan Honor Flag was 
conceived by James H. Burton of New 
York and has the hearty indorsement 
of Secretary of the Treasury William 
G. McAdoo. The plan calls for the 
award of an Honor Flag by the Treas
ury Department to each community 
in tho nation when that community 
will have attained its quota of sub
scriptions to the third loan.
Tho first flag was made In Wash
ington under tho supervision of Mrs. 
McAdoo.
Flag Raising Is Gala Event.
Tho raising of the sample flag in 
Washington was a gala event. For 
the first tlmo In the history of tho 
Treasury Departinont all of the em
ployes of that department left off 
work for flftoen minutes to attend a 
national event. They grouped in 
front of the Treasury building and 
choorod lustily when tho first Honor 
Flag was pullod to the top of a mast 
thero by Lowis B. Franklin, Director 
of tho War Loan organization. And 
tho choors of tho omployos were but 
a part of the demonstration for thou
sands of Washingtonians crowded in 
the stroot tying up street car traffic 
whilo tho ceremony was on.
The flag is a whito flag with a deep 
rod border and three perpendicular 
strlpos running through tho center. 
Tho strlpos aro the same width as the 
border. Tho official flags which will 
be awarded by the Treasury Depart
ment measure 36x54 Inches.
In many cities patriotic women aro 
working on I ho making of blggor flags 
than the official ones.
In Cleveland tho young women of 
tho Junior League aro making a hugo 
silk banner which they will donate to 
tho central commlttoo to bo flown 
when Clovoland attains Its quota. In 
other cities largo silk flags to be simi
larly donated are bolng made by tho 
women of clubs and church organiza
tions.
Besides the Honor Flags which will 
be awarded to the communities thero 
will bo a state Honor Flag and a na
tional Honor Flag. On the Stato 
Flags which will bo flown In tho stato 
capitals thore will be an Honor Roll 
on which will bo Inscribed tho names 
of the communities in that state in 
tho order In which they earn the right 
to fly the flag. On the National Honor 
Flag which will IL flown.in Washing
ton the names of the states will be 
enrolled as they reach their quotas.
Buyers Get Window Cards.
Window cards will be given to all 
subscribers to the Third Loan. On 
the cards, which measure 7x9 inches, 
thero will be a replica of tho Honor 
Flag in colors and a blank space in 
which to write the name of the sub
scriber. These will be displayed in 
the windows of the homes of bond 
buyers.
Not only will these cards serve as a 
recognition of the patriotism and loy
alty of the householder but they will 
have a strong advertising power. If 
 man has one of the window cards 
proclaiming to all of his neighbors 
that he has bought his bond the 
neighbors are going to get busy and 
3o their duty. One card on a street 
Is bound to be followed by others and 
eventually these cards, meeting the 
eye of the tardy one everywhere he 
looks, are going to be the force that 
will spur him on to the purchase.
Thrift Thought.
Get the thrift habitthe broad thrift 
habit, now; practice it thoughtfully; 
waste not the little things; find the joy 
that a growing bank account bring.1-; 
invest your savings safely and profit
ably; remember tomorrow but forget 
not today; spend for the things that 
last and find the secret of the broader 
thrift that makes for better living. It 
is the only thrift worth while.
Substittlfe for Tobacco.
Throughout tho tropical Orient tho 
natives employ a substitute for tobac
co consisting of a slice of arlcapnlm 
nut, wrapped In betel leaf, flavored 
with a fine lime made of native sea 
shells, and colored with carmine. The 
habit Is universal, especially with the 
women, and sellers of betel nut may 
be seen on many of the street corners 
In Saigon and other cities of IndoChlna.

equipment is on its way to Tech and 
is expected at any time. Already there 
have come some trench lumber and

Trench digging .will start as soon 
as these materials arrive. The trench
