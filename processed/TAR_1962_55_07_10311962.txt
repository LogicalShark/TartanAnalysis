Annual Campus Chest Drive 
Supports and Finances Various 
National and Local Projects
by Sally Sheats
With the approach of the an
nual Campus Chest Drive, it 
might be valuable for Tech stu
dents to consider what just one 
dollar can mean. For example, it 
can mean three packs of ciga
rettes which can be consumed and 
forgotten in a day and a half. Ten 
cokes ox four hamburgers, over 
a period of a semester, will leave 
little to show, except perhaps, an 
expanding figure. Ten cups of cof
fee, hurriedly gulped in Skibe, or 
three boxes of No-Doze downed 
during all night sessions through 
I ^ the semester which result in 
I jumpy nerves and fatigue but 
little else. Or maybe you forgot 
to get that reserve book back to 
the library till it was a day late. 
In all these ways the students 
dollar is dissipated.
A dollar donated to Campus 
Chest, however, can have some 
lasting effects. First, you are con
tributing to a program aimed at 
helping students here and abroad, 
( > Some of these charities are: The 
World University Service, The 
National Service and Scholarship 
Fund for Negro Students, and 
also a Special Tech Project. Your
dollar counts because all of these 
charities are primarily student 
financed.
In previous campaigns, it was 
unclear where the students mon
ey was going. The committee this 
year hopes to give an accurate 
picture of how the money will be 
used and stimulate student 
awareness as to the importance 
of Campus Chest.

Carol McWilliams Crowned Queen, 
Reigns Over 1962 Fall Festival
On Friday evening at the bon
fire, a very happy, excited and 
surprised Carol McWilliams was 
crowned Carnegie Techs Fall 
Festival Queen 1962 by last years 
queen Arlene Winner. Carols at
tendants for the weekend reign 
were Sally Morley and Susan 
Schumacher.
These three freshman beauties 
had places of honor at the pep 
rally and bonfire and at the jazz 
concert on Friday evening. On 
Saturday afternoon, they were 
presented at the football game 
with the Kiltie Band, and Queen 
Carol gave out the trophies at 
Saturday nights dance.
Carol is an acting major here 
at Tech and hails from Barring
ton, Rhode Island. In high school 
she was a cheerleader, a mem
ber of the yearbook staff, the 
French Club, and the Literary 
Club. She was also on her schools 
social committee and participated 
in girls sports.
Carol is very ambitious in her 
work. She loves all of her classes 
here at Tech, and hopes to go 
on to get her Masters degree in 
drama.

On Friday, October 26th, the 
campus assembled in front of 
Donner Hall for the Torchlite 
Parade. The parade proceeded to 
the bonfire on the Edward's Lot 
behind Morewood Gardens, where 
the Fall Festival Queen was 
crowned. Master of Ceremonies 
for the evening was John Reed 
of KDKA. After a few 
cheers by the cheerleaders, the 
from each fraternity pre
sented an original cheer. The 
cheers showed enthusiasm for the 
St. Vincent game on Saturday. 
Coach Hirschburg welcomed those 
present.
After the pep rally, the festivi
ties continued in the gym, where 
a large crowd turned out for the 
Peter Nero Jazz Trio. Peter Nero, 
at the piano, Joe Casaded on the 
drums, and Frank Sastek on the 
bass, gave their renditions of such 
songs as Moon Rivei', Tea for 
Two, My Funny Valentine, 
and When I Fall in Love. They 
also played music from the scores 
of West Side Story, Porgy and 
Bess, and My Fair Lady. 
Many of their arrangements were 
original, such as Scratch My 
Back, and Over the Rainbow.
The Trio has been together for 
one year, and already has four 
albums on the market with a fifth 
one coming out shortly.
On Saturday evening about 
11:00 P.M. the Fall Festival 
Queen, Caroline McWilliams, pre
sented the Fall Festival Display 
trophies to the three fraternities

The long hours of hard work 
seemed well worth the while to

Barengoltz, Huff Debate Policies
Barengoltz Argues 
With Walfenstein
Editor, The Tartan:
I wish to write an open reply 
to Professor Wolfensteins open 
letter of October 24 concerning 
the illegal acts of the United 
States with regard to the Cu
ban problem.
Dear Professor Wolfenstein:
You choose to argue the Cu
ban situation on a moral plane, 
a wise decision, because mor
ality is a difficult subject to dis
cuss. I am not so commendably 
idealistic as you. I, for one, 
would rather be a moral than 
dead. By death I mean not just 
physical death; I consider com
munism an alternative form.
A practical view of the world 
shows communism continuously 
gaining territory and people in 
an undeclared wax'. This has 
been done by bluffing, by the 
threat of nuclear war, if the 
United States were to interfear. 
Thus we have watched Korea, 
Laos, and Vietnam disappear. 
The communists have made it 
perfectly clear that their pur
pose is world domination. Why 
let them achieve their end at 
the paltry price of a gigantic 
blue?
One can only be pushed so 
far, up to the point where the 
wall at his back can be felt and 
his resolve crystallizes. The 
communists have made a mis
take in Cuba. They have given 
us a position to brace ourselves 
and push back hard. I think 
President Kennedy should be 
praised for his insignt in seeing 
Cuba as our opportunity to re
verse the progress of commu
nism. Perhaps we can continue 
and push the communists right 
back to the Kremlin wall. I 
hope so.
Jack Barengoltz
About Institutions 
And Organizations 
Public and Private
Editor, The Tartan:
In reply to H. & T. Mumaw.
What is a private organiza
tion?
Any activity involving more 
than one individual (including 
love-making) cannot, by its na
ture, be private. Institutions are
those social groupings that are 
formally organized in order to 
effect a common purposewhich 
purpose may be finite or perpet
uating.
And what is public?
Public refers to those things 
that are of the people and is 
most often used to refer to the 
citizenry of a political institu
tion, e.g., the State. And here 
an inexactness of meaning and 
of reasoning is disposed to arise 
out of the muddled notion that 
the word private is antithetical 
to public in the sense that pri
vate refers to things other than 
of the State. But I submit that 
private is antithetical to public 
only in the sense that it dis
tinguishes individual activity 
from group activity. The State, 
then, is no less private, no 
more public, than the Univer
sity, the Club, the Secret Soci
ety. It is only that each has its 
own particular boundaries.
All institutions are exclusion
ary in one manner or another.
Institutions are exclusionary 
to the point of admitting only 
those who contribute to the com
mon purpose. A man who may 
associate himself with a great 
array of institutions can, in the 
end, serve with complete fidelity 
but one, be it the State, the 
Church, the Family, the Political 
Party, the Army, Business, the 
University, the Fraternity. As 
long as there is no conflict, he 
may never be impelled to de
cide which institution is primewith himself and which others 
are consequently secondary.
Yet men frequently are in
volved in struggles that arise be
tween two opposing institutions, 
i.e., conflicting purposes.
Individuals are sometimes 
torn between two overlapping 
institutions (as between the 
Church and the Communist Par
ty). The members of one insti
tution are sometimes pitted 
against the members of a par
allel or corresponding institution 
(as in War between two auto
nomous Nations). And some
times a segment of the remain
der of the membership as a 
consequence of divergent pur
poses it hold as the total mem
bership of a smaller institution, 
wholly or concentrically within 
the larger one (as a State finds 
itself against the Federal Gov
ernment).
It is* this third situation that
pertains In the main to Carnegie 
Institute of Technology and the 
Tech Fraternities as well as to 
the Government of the United 
States and the State of Miss
issippi. When such a conflict 
arises, there is one of three pos
sibilities: either the larger in
stitution defers to the smaller; 
or the smaller, to the larger; or 
they mutually disassociate, one 
from the other.
A Reiteration.
It was not, then, that I ques
tioned the right of so-called 
private social organizations to 
practice discrimination,, though I 
did suggest to their member
ships the dubiousness of the ra
tionale of such a course. And 
so, avoiding the question of 
whether the Fraternities, that 
insist on their right to partici
pate in these practices be toler
able within the socio-political 
fabric of the United States or 
be in opposition to the meaning 
of the Constitution, I have called 
upon the Institution of Carnegie 
Tech, in the event it cannot per
suade these same Fraternities to 
drop those particular clauses, to 
disassociate itself from these 
same socities for the reason that 
their practices and ends are in
consistent with the purposes of a 
University; for certainly I would 
not encourage the third open 
road of having Tech bow to the 
National Fraternities, though it 
has, in fact, done so these many 
years. This course that I sug
gest, far from radical, is. just the 
one many of our great Univer
sities of the East have already 
taken. And I had asked the 4 
October petitioners to direct 
their statements toward this 
more fruitful end of helping our 
School to remove the mote from 
its own eye rather than to ser
monize those remote and con
sequently of more indirect con
cern.
The Question of Magnitude.

ties are violent physical expres
sions of racism on a sizable
scale; the discriminatory Frater
nity activities are far subtler 
in their psychological nature 
covering the full range of Oc
cidentals, Negroes, Orientals and 
of Protestants, Catholics, Jew, 
The prejudice - victimized mind 
is less disturbing to face than 
the riot - mangled physiognomy, 
but infinitely more dangerous. 
Do we therefore pride ourselves 
that we are gentlemen in the 
ways we segxegate? I cannot 
myself weigh, as the Mumaws 
seem able to do, which is less
evil; for both activities are
manifestations of the same cal
culated construct to separate and 
to keep separate (which pattern 
the Supreme Court shattered, 
when it repudiated the equalbut-separate policy largely for 
reasons of the psychological 
damage it wxeaks upon a minoi-ity segment of our citizenry). 
Nor can I measure the damage 
to those who acquiesce to the 
perpetuation of these things un
der the delusionary rationaliza
tion that they are of small con
sequences.

A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
A Small Island
Since just about everyone is discussing Cuba these 
days, I will conform to societys norms, and add a few com
ments of my own. The United States has no right to 
blockade Cuba, and especially it has no right to search Rus
sian ships. When in 1812 the British attempted to search 
American ships, the United States went to war over this 
gross violation of national sovereignty. During the CivilWar the Northern government seized an English ship with 
Confederates aboard, but promptly realized it was wrong in 
doing so, apologized for the error, and allowed the South
erners to reach their destination. Thus the Russians are 
right in saying the United States is acting aggressivelyas 
aggression has been historically interpreted.
However, the United States may act the way it has 
because it has the might to enforce its wishes, just as the 
British did when the American started the War of 1812. 
(Contrary to popular belief, the United States lost the war.) 
The question then is not one of right, but rather one of 
should we. Let us examine this question. The Commun
ists have succeeded in convincing much of the world that 
the United States is an imperialist warmonger. Since un
committed nations except actions of such a nature from us, 
we should not be concerned with what they think of any 
warlike actionsif we acted otherwise, it would not change 
their opinion so why worry about what they think? In any 
case a nation should not hesitate to take any steps it feels 
necessary in any given situation because another country 
will not think well of it for doing so. After all, what can 
Ghana, Guinea, etc. do to us? Forbid us to give them econ
omic aid? Refuse to vote against us in the U.N. as they have 
been doing consistently? Obviously other countrys feelings 
need not deter us from any actions. So the question be
comes one of what benefits we would get from searching 
Russian ships. This can be answered simplywe would pre
vent them from setting up bases of a military nature as 
near to us as we have to them (we have a ring of bases 
surrounding the U.S.S.R.) Thus we are acting in a way 
calculated to keep our military advantage over themfor 
obvious reasons. This argument can also be used to include 
reasons for invading Cuba. After all, we hp.ve gone this far; 
why not get rid of the problem altogether?
The preceeding analysis can be criticized for greatly 
oversimplifying the problem. I have tried to cover only the 
most pertinent and vital points. The moral question is com
pletely disregarded. I believe it to be purely a matter of 
opinion. It is romantic to think of a world based on the 
principle of right, but unfortunately the nations of the 
world can not agree on what is right although each be
lieves that it has found the true meaning of the word. The 
United States is defending itself against a pressure (mili
tary bases) and a way of life (Communism) that are re
pugnant to its citizens when it takes action against Cuba.

om
ahead after Tech had valiantly 
tried to stop the drive for a little 
less than ten minutes.
Play Shines
Tech had taken the lead with 
10:36 left in the game on a 51 
yard TD run by Terry Hechler 
which must go down as Techs 
most brilliant play this year. Be
hind 19-14 with a fourth down 
and a yard and a half to go for 
the first, Tech popped out of the 
huddle and lined up in a running 
formation instead of the kicking 
formation. As the crowd cheered 
because the Tartans were going to 
go for it, Hechler sent fullback 
Smokey Merrill into the center of 
the line for what appeared to be 
a first down. As eleven greenclad 
converged on Merrill, 
Hechler put the ball on his own 
hip, loafed out around his right 
as if carrying out a fake, 
turned the corner, and with a 
burst of speed was by the last St. 
Vincent man before the defender 
realized that he was being bam
boozled. The TD appeared to be 
the backbreaker, but to their 
credit St. Vincent came back to 
score in the final seconds.
In general, the entire team 
played a cerditable brand of foot
ball in spite of the handicaps they 
were working under. Besides 
Hechler, A1 Abels played a par
ticularly good game, churning out 
additional yards when he ap
parently had been stopped. End 
Dave DAppolonia played ex
tremely well.
Student Body Play
If any one thing hurt Tech more 
than anything else, it was theTartans inability to cope with the 
Bearcats student body play. 
This was an end sweep that look
ed to the defensive end as if the 
entire St. Vincent student body 
was coming at him.
The mum-spotted crowd was 
awash with excitement after a 
rousing pep rally the night before. 
Tech won the coin flip for the 
second time this season and elect
ed to receive.
Three short probes into the line 
netted six yards and Tech kicked. 
St. Vincent took the ball on their 
own 35 yard line and in 10 plays
mared by two penalties scored 
with the TD going to Pete Baumbach on a nifty Quarterback op
tion. For the first of several drives 
Quarterback Jan Esway shone ia 
his signal calling and ball-hand
ling.
Tech took the ball on the en
suing kickoff and went 37 yards 
to the Bearcat 40 before HechlersV^ 
tiass to DAppolonia was inter
cepted at the Cat 36. Working 
the team like a pro quarterback, 
Esway marched the team down 
the field to scored in eight plays. 
Again, Esway who handled the 
option play which allowed half
back Dave Slatniske to barrel into 
the end zone, taking two Tech 
defenders with him.
With three minutes left in the j 
first quarter, the game had all 
the makings of another rout 
which Teteh had suffered in an 
earlier game. However, sparked 
by the running of Abels, Tech 
took the kickoff and went 35 yards 
to the Bearcat 25 before Hechler 
was forced to kick. In this drive, 
Abels gained 21 yards with his 
slashing style of running.
The Bearcats took the ball at 
their own 20 yard  line after 
Hechler had punted into the end 
zone, and proceeded to begin yet 
another march. Furman Smith 
had other ideas, and on a pass in
tended for Baumbach made a 
beautiful catch and was forced 
out at the Tech 40. With Wisneiwski, Merril and Abels handling 
the ball-toting chores, Tech went 
to the St. Vincent 15 yard line.
On fourth and one at the fifteen, 
the defense stiffened and forced 
Tech to relinquish the ball. St. 
Vincent moved the ball to the 44, 
where they handed the ball to 
Tech via a fumble recovered by 
Rich Ferguson.
First Score
This proved to be the impetus 
needed to start Tech on its first 
sustained scoring drive of the 
day. DAppolonia caught 3 passes 
in the scoring drive good for 24 v' 
yards and one TD. Wisniewski 
kicked the point and with 35 sec
onds left in the half, the score 
stood 13-7.
The second half saw Tech 
kicking off, and four downs later

Tech could do nothing offensively 
and kicked right back to the 
Cats. Obviously fired up on de
fense, the Tartans were quick to 
cover a fumble by Slatniske on 
his own 34.
Tech Leads
Abels carried the ball to the 
30, Merrill took it to the 19 on a 
nice run, Abels again carried the 
ball to Tech 13. On a second and 
four, Abels roared into the end 
^ zone behind nice blocking for the 
TD. Wisneiwski kicked the point 
to put Tech ahead 14-13.
St. Vincent took to the air on 
the next series of downs, and this 
time it w'as Abels who intercepted 
at the Saint 23. Tech drove to the 
7, where the game Bearcats forced 
Tech to give up the ball.
The visitors couldnt move the 
ball, kicked to the Tech 44, and 
 got a gift as a clipping penalty on 
Tech to put the ball on their own 
29. Three plays gained nothing, 
and on fourth down, a high pass 
over the Tech kickers head al
lowed St. Vincent to down the 
runner on his own thirteen. The 
ball went over to the Cats and 
they promptly scored in two 
plays. Tech took the kickoff and 
went to their own 49, where a 
fourth and one situation gave 
Qjj) Hechler a chance to get Dick Mer
rill into the line and score on the 
51 yard run.

Ai Abels is snowed under by the Bearcat players on an end run.
The remaining three intramural 
football playoff berths remained 
unfilled this past week as a result 
of one upset and a virtual three 
way tie for second place.
The upset was sprung by Delta 
Tau Delta over previously un
beaten ATO by a score of 20-4. 
Paul Hodge threw three touch
down strikes to Dick Scott to 
spark the Delts attack while a 
stiff defense held ATO to only 
four first downs. In the only other 
Steeler game played, the Trojans 
beat the Browns 19-6.
In the Eagles League, Tau 
Delta Phi remained out in front 
with an blemished 4-0 record. In 
the close, three-way battle for 
second place, Beta Sig won a big 
one over Sigma Nu, 18-17. Sigma 
Nu rallied for seven points in the 
final period but fell one point 
short. Inv another big one, the 
Marauders broke a third quarter 
deadlock with two TDs to beat 
the Dunkers 22-12.
Perhaps the most important 
game of the wreek was Beta Theta 
Pis victory over Kappa Sig. The 
I Betas strong ground game was 
the big difference in this one since 
the cold weather and high wind 
made passing difficult. The final 
score was 23-9 and this assured 
the Betas of a playoff berth. In 
other games, Kappa Sig scored 25 
points in the second half to beat 
SAE 32-18. SAE also lost to BTP, 
this time by a score of 20-8.

F*Sr* S  CARNEGIE TARTAN  Wednesday. October SI,
After four weeks of dry land 
practice, the Tartan swimming 
team will finally hit the water on 
Wednesday. October 31 when they 
travel to the University of Pitts
burgh's new pool. The Pitt pool 
is considered to be the largest and 
most modern college pool in the 
nation.
The swimmers will be intro
duced to Tech water for the first 
time this year the following day. 
Heading the swimmers will be 
Captain Tom Brunson, freestyler, 
and diver Tom Snow, along with 
several returning lettermen.
Techs first swimming encounter 
will be a dual meet with Grove 
City at the Tech pool on Decem
ber 8. Grove City will be strength
ened by the addition of several 
outstanding freshmen, and should

Tech Rifle Team
The Mountaineer Sharpshooters

as pie-season rifle powerhouses, 
showed their power as they drop
ped Tech, 1429-1398, last Satur
day at the new Tech range.
High for WVU was John Writer 
with a fine 292. Tech was led by 
freshman Mike Knepley with a 
284, followed by Joe Schlitt with

higher than the team average last

87 record against some very stiff 
competition.

U-Stars Upset Eagles, 
Take I A1 Game, 29-10
By Scott McCormick
In spite of Fridays w'indy. 
freezing cold weather, nearly two 
hundred hardy spectators turned 
out to w'atch the I. M. All Stars 
grind out a 29-10 victory over last 
year's champs, the Grad Eagles.
The first half was a low-scoring 
affair with each squad feeling 
each other out. The Grad Eagles 
w ere the first to score. After stop
ping an All Star drive on their 3, 
Bob Murphy to Fred Kosofsky 
passes took the Eagles all the way 
down the field. The final pass was 
good for nine yards and the T.D.
The All-Stars bounced right 
back, taking advantage of a pass 
interception by Howie Pifer deep 
in Eagle territory. Gerry Kosko 
took the ball over from the one to 
end the first half scoring.
The All-Stars came roaring out 
in the thii'd quarter with two 
more touchdowns to sew the game 
up. The first T.D. came on a nineyard Dave Devos to George Ciarmella pass. Devos soon scored
himself on a two-yard run. Gerry 
Kosko ran for another score in the 
fourth period and the All Stars 
final T.D. came when Howie Pifer 
grabbed another Bob Murphy pass 
and returned it all the way for the 
score.
However, the key to the AllStars win was the continual pres
sure put on Bob Murphy, the 
Eagles QB, by Joe Browne, Roger 
Leonard, and Bob Balzer, the 
Stars defensive line. Their con
tinual rush forced poor passes and 
kept the Eagles in their own terri
tory for most of the game. This is 
evidenced by the fact that the1 
Eagles could only muster three j 
first downs in the entire second 
half. Scoring: Grad Eagles 
Kosofsky 8, Murphy 2. All Stars 
Devos 6, Kosko 6, Ciarmella 6. 
Borofsky 5, Pifer 5, Kalogeras 1.
