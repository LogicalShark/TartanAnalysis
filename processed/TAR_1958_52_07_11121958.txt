New Tech Outline
Tartan Activities Center 
Is First To Be Built
Less than two years ago, in April 1957, the Carnegie 
Board of Trustees approved a $24,350,000 building and developement program.
The development program has been undertaken so that 
^at Carnegie Institute of Technology will be able to con
tinue as a great seat of learning,#-----------------------------------------------------
knowledge, research, creative at
tainment and liberal, professional 
education.
Fund Raising
Almost half of the $24,350,000 
needed for the Program has been 
realized, for the total is now $11,- 
381.131.28. Contributors to the de
velopment program include Pitts'.||rgh business and industrial or
ganizations, national firms, alum
ni, foundations, individuals, and 
the Carnegie Board of Trustees.
This program, which is the first 
major capital fund-raising pro
gram in Carnegies fifty 
year history, has five objectives: 
increases in faculty salaries, 
tional outstanding teachers for 
the faculty, construction of four 
new buildings; another Engineerand Science Building, Library, 
ampus Acivities Center, and 
Dramatic Arts Center, improve
ment of existing facilities and ex
tensive campus improvement, 
parking and recreation.
The difference between a good 
university and a great university 
is a distinguished faculty and 
alumni. For this reason, Carnegie 
is facing the problems of retain
ing its scholars and attracting 
;^>er men of learning. These are 
two phases of the Development 
Program.
E & S Building
The new Engineering and Sci
ence Building, which is part of 
the construction phase of the pro
gram, will provide space for me
chanical and electrical engineer
ing, the new computation center, 
additional labs, specific research 
equipment, and parts of the new 
ijpclear engineering program. The 
engineering and science project 
also involves renovation of exist
ing facilities and installation of 
new research and teaching equip
ment.
The Library, to be built where 
Skibo now stands, will have 
seminar rooms, record listening 
I rooms, exhibit'lounges, microfilm 
reading rooms, and an educational 
motion picture film library in ad<^j|ion to the usual facilities.
Arts Center
The proposed Dramatic Arts 
Center has an ultra modern thea[continued on page 3]
Publicity Seminar
A publicity seminar for all 
campus organizations will be 
held this afternoon, November 
13, at 4:30 in the Morewood 
Gardens Dorm Council Room. 
All organizations are urged to 
send a representative to this 
meeting.

Queen Frederika 
Visits Campus
Queen Frederika of Greece, honored Carnegie Tech by 
her visit here on November 3.
The Queen attended a conference on nuclear research 
held in President Warners office. Since Her Majesty has a 
great interest in both the scientific and humanistic aspects of 
the subject, the discussion was centered on these aspects.

/ 'New Campus Design
A new design for the Tech campus has been adopted in connection with the Carnegie Tech building 
program. As can be seen in the drawing above, th e present J^cut will serve as a second larger mall, 
which will face* on Forbes Avenue and will be lev el with the street.
'59 Thistle Editor 
Plans New Layout 
For Tech Annual
Working on the theme The 
Tech community within the Pitts
burgh community in a bicenten
nial year, Thistle editor Dick 
Clemm and his staff have rear
ranged the 1959 Tech yearbook 
from front to back.
The new annual, beginning 
with Freshman Camp and follow
ing through to the senior section, 
will depict the Tech students 
multi-phase development while in 
college. In order to portray this 
development, important changes 
have been made within individual 
section for the book.
Organizations
Campus organizations, upon 
their request, will receive a full 
page layout complete with rep
resentative pictures of their ac
tivities rather than a half page 
with only a group photograph. 
The Thistles introduction will in
clude a separate page for each 
section, making available more 
space for narrative photography 
and art work.
A two color art work, emblem
atic of the books theme, will 
form the inside cover. Last years 
personal touch in the advertise
ment section will be expanded 
upon; Techites will be pictured 
patronizing advertisers wherever 
possible.
As in the past, the Thistle will 
be available only on a subscrip
tion basis, and will be distributed 
to subscribers at the 1959 fall reg
istration. Seniors will receive 
their copies by mail.
Dramats to Present

pects.
The Queens visit to the campus 
was made at her own request, 
when she and King Paul were in 
the United States in 1953. At that 
time she became acquainted with 
Dr. Edward Cruetz, first head of 
Carnegies nuclear research de
partment. Since her plans for this 
trip included a stop at nearby 
Shippingport, the campus confer
ence was included in her agenda. 
Tours Shippingport 
Queen Frederika arrived at 
Carnegie Tech about 5:00 p.m. 
Monday after touring the Ship
pingport research center as guest 
of the Navy. Following her con
ference here, she went to Con
gressman James Fultons home for 
dinner and a reception.
Queen Frederika has gained 
world-wide recognition and ad
miration for her devotion toward 
the people of Greece. During the 
war against communism she often 
visited the fronts and today she 
is active in such rehabilitation 
! projects as orphan homes, hospi| tals, and the annual woolens for

Her Majesty is particularly in
terested in bettering educational 
standards in Greece. In a Look

Next Speaker 
Is Hugo Meier
By Georgia White
Technology and Social Re
sponsibility will be the subject 
of Dr. Hugo Meier of the CIT 
History department, who will 
speak next Tuesday, November 
18, at the all-school assembly in 
Fine Arts Theater at 11:30.
Dr. Meier will be concerned 
mainly with a question which has 
troubled America in the past and 
presentwhat share of the re
sponsibility for planning and for 
application of technological 
changes rests with tne scientist 
and engineer as well as with other 
agencies of society such as the 
government.
From his viewpoint as a historain, Dr. Meier will examine the 
American past to determine how 
early Americans tried to define?
a group of escaping officers are fu
gitives from the enemy. They, are 
in the charge of Marie Chaissaigne. 
a member of a secret escape-organization called the River Line, 
who will be played by Jeanne 
Waehrer. Sudden emergency 
drives them to violent action and 
to the killing of one of their num
ber. The truth about the dead man 
emerges later and raises the ques
tion of the ultimate responsibility 
of those who killed him in good 
faith.
The theme of the play is the 
predicament of peaceful Christian 
men and women who find them
selves in a world where great 
numbers have rejected the law 
and are determined to wipe away 
even its memory from the earth. 
The underlying question is how to 
live in an age of violence. It pro
vides a basis for dramatic move
ment throughout the play and 
gives the work a character of ac
tion and feeling.
Directed by Mary Morris assistwould continue to give book les
sonsthat is all they know hew 
to give. But there would be new 
teachers to teach the children how 
to be decent human beings. They 
would instill in them a personal 
responsibility to the community. 
In our country, freedom has come 
to be considered as a piece of 
property of the citizen rather 
than as a personal responsibility. 
An ideal democracy is one in 
which every person carries his 
share of the burden.

Campus Holds 
Mock Elections
In the mock elections sponsored 
by the Young Democrats and Re
publicans Club and held on Tues., 
Oct. 28, 273 Tech Students sup
ported political candidates.
Hugh Scott for U. S. Senator 
and David Lawrence for Gover
nor. In their support of these can
didates, Tech voters predicted the 
course of last Tuesdays actual 
election. Contrary to the state 
vote, however, the poll showed 
Republicans taking all the other 
offices at stake. The following re
sults were obtained.
U. S. Senator
Leader, D.................... 35.5%
Scott, R.............................64.5%
Governor
Lawrence, D....................61.0%
McGonigle, R..................39.9%
Similar mock elections were 
held on all college campuses in 
Western Penna. The overall re
sults showed all Republicans with 
the exception of Gubernatorial 
hopeful Arthur McGonigle, vic
torious. The elections were co-ordinated by the Penna. Clearing 
House Association and were spon
sored jointly on the Tech campus 
by the Young Republicans and 
Young Democrats.
Student Congress 
Court Reviews 
Appeal From CFP
In a meeting last Tuesday, No
vember 4, the Supreme Cpurt of 
Student Government decided that 
it did not have appellate jurisdic
tion over a decision of the CFP 
court of justice. It also made a 
recommendation that student con
gress change the courts jurisdic
tion to include CFP court.
This means that an appeal by 
Alpha Tau Omega of the recent
! CFP court decision awarding 
i ATO nine weeks social probation 
j will go to the most highest ap
peal, which is Dr. Brown, Direc! tor of Student Personnel and 
! Welfare.
Constitution
I A clause in the Student Gov: ernment Constitution concerning 
' the courts jurisdiction says that ! 
| the court shall be a final students ! 
I court of appeal for all student i 
| courts. The court ruled that since 
I 3 faculty members sit on the CFP 
! court its not a student court.
The courts recommendation 
asked that the constitution be j 
\ changed to give the court appel| 
; late jurisdiction over all student 
courts and all courts of student 
organizations.

New Campus
^ [continued from page 1]
tre, rehearsal rooms, classrooms, 
construction areas, and backsage 
facilities included in its planning. 
With the new center, joint pro
ductions with the music depart
ment will be made possible.
The new Student Activities 
Center will provide a focal point 
for student life on the campus. 
It will include dining facilities, 
meeting rooms, recreation room, 
^>d space for student activities.
Ground Breaking:
Ground breaking and actual 
construction on the new buildings 
will begin soon after the first of 
the year. The first construction to 
be begun will be the Student Ac
tivities Center. When it is com
pleted, Library construction will 
begin, for Skibo will no longer 
be needed.
Complete transformation of the 
Aimpus will occur when the pro
posed changes permitting maxi
mum use of the campus, giving 
the campus theme and continuity, 
and adding to its attractiveness 
are made.
The changes include: The en
tire hill fronting on Forbes Street 
will be leveled. An attractive 
campus entrance (with two street 
accesses) will be established on 
Forbes Street with The Cut 
jtidened and a central road built 
TromForbes to Schenley Park.
Carefully planned campus traf
fic patterns with new roads has 
been drawn up which includes 
three hundred additional oncampus parking spaces and the 
elimination of the roadway curv
ing past the Administration Build
ing from Frew Street to Tech 
Street. The football field will be 
rebuilt for intercollegiate compe
tition and will have stands for 
o,000 persons. Practice fields and 
three fields for intermural sports 
will be provided. A landscaped 
Central Square will be built in 
the area boarded by the Admin
istration Building, Fine Arts 
Building, and present Engineer
ing and Science Building.

fancy and comic diving during the 
intermission. Carol will be swim
ming the shows only solo, a clas
sical water ballet.
Although the Tarquans didnt 
have a show last year due to the 
limited staff, this years addition 
of fourteen freshmen and the 
twenty girls returning from last 
year make this years production 
possible.
Tickets will be on sale three 
weeks before the water show.
Inquiring Reporter
Campus Population Reveals Its 
Views Of Blenheims Column
By Lex Baker
In view of the recent controversy caused by Blenheims 
column, To Banbury Cross, the Tartans Inquiry Reporter 
had to determine campus opinion on Blenheims views.
Following are the replies to the questions What is your 
opinion of the Blenheim column? and Do you think it 
~~~-------------------?should be continued?
Charles Moore 
To Be Advisor 
Of Scotch n Soda
Charles Werner Moore, assistant 
professor of drama at Tech, has 
been selected to advise the Scotch 
and Soda Club during the 1958- 
59 season. *
A graduate of Williams College, 
he received his B.A. in 1943, and 
then attended Yale University 
where he got his MFA. Before 
coming to Tech, Mr. Moore was 
an instructor at the University of 
Kansas City and director of both 
the Provincetown and Sharon 
Playhouses in Connecticut. He 
also has had articles published in
Charles Moore
Scotch and Soda Advisor
the AETA Journal, Theater Arts 
Society, and Outdoor Life maga
zines.
Free Hand
Since Scotch and Soda is the 
only group of its kind on campus 
composed of non-drama students, 
Mr. Moore plans to give the club 
a free hand in all their produc
tions. He plans to help the group 
as much as he can in a supervis
ory rather than an instructory 
manner. Past production tech
niques will remain much the same 
and all plans will still be origi
nated by members.
When asked his opinion of the 
tradition that members are trying 
to start this yearserving scotch 
and soda at the partyhe said 
that he thought this was a good 
idea. Itll give the name of the
club and purpose and hed be
happy to give it a chance.
Among the numerous plays 
which Mr. Moore has directed at 
Tech are The Crucible, Right
You Are (If You Think So!),
Measure for Measure, and The 
Chief Thing.
Philip Rosi, senior, ME: It
should be continued. Although it 
appears slightly biased at times, it 
makes for good reading.
Susan Roth, junior, General 
Studies and Dick Anderson, junior, 
Chem E; We think its very in
teresting because it stirs up con
troversy. If we had more contro
versy, we might have more school 
spirit.
Dorothy Beehner, senior, Home
Ec: The column should be con
tinued because Blenheims bring
ing up controversial subjects that 
are setting the campus on its ear.* 
But I think that the author should 
do a bit more research and get his 
facts straight.
Nancy Elson, freshman, Psy
chology: Good feature. Some of 
the articles are very good, espe
cially the one about the Little 
Prince.
A1 Gickler, sophomore, EE: Al
though some of the facts may be 
false, Blenheim gives a basis.for 
discussion. I suggest that he stop 
coloring the facts.
Nancy Edgar, senior, Psychol
ogy: By using a campus group as 
an example in the attack on Con
spicuous Consumption, Blenheim 
tended to make the focal point the 
fraternity rather than the view 
which he intended to express. In 
the future, I suggest that he be 
more concrete in his discussion.

ANYONE FOR FOOTBALL?
When Pancho Sigafoos, sophomore, pale and sensitive, first saw 
Willa Ludowic, freshman, lithe as a hazel wand and rosy as the 
dawn, he hemmed not; neither did he h?w. I adore you, he 
said without preliminary.
Thanks, hey, said Willa, flinging her apron over her face 
modestly. What position do you play?
Position? said Pancho, looking at her askance. (The 
askance is a ligament just behind the ear.)
On the football team, said Willa.
Football! sneered Pancho, his young lip curling. Football 
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. I am not a 
football player. I am a poet!
fSo long, buster, said Willa.
Wait! cried Pancho, clutching her damask forearm.
She placed a foot on his pelvis and wrenched berself free. 
I only go with football players, she said, and walked, hiutmer* 
ing, into the gathering dusk.
Mz  * *. Az  * "
.....
Pancho went to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered !  
dread dilemma. What kind of cigarette did Pancho light? Why, 
Philip Morris, of corris!
Philip Morris is always welcome, but never more than when 
you are sore beset. When a fellow needs a friend, when the heart 
is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, then, then above all, 
is the time for the mildness, the serenity, that only Philip Morris 
can supply.
Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his fevered brow 
cooled, his synapses restored, after smoking a fine Philip Morris, 
came to a decision. Though he was a bit small for football (an 
even four feet) and somewhat overweight (427 pounds), he tried 
out for the teamand tried out with such grit and gumption 
that he made it.
Panchos college opened the season against the Manhattan 
School of Mines, always a mettlesome foe, but strengthened 
this year by four exchange students from Gibraltar who had been 
suckled by she-apes. By the middle of the second quarter the 
Miners had wrought such havoc upon Panchos team that there 
was nobody left on the bench but Pancho. And when the 
quarterback was sent to the infirmary with his head driven 
straight down into his esophagus, the coach had no choice but 
to put Pancho in.
Panchos teammates were not conspicuously cheered as the 
little fellow took his place in the huddle.
Gentleman, said Pancho, some of you may regard poetry 
as sissy stuff, but now in our most trying hour, let us hark to 
these words from Paradise Lost: All is not lost; the uncon
querable will and study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage 
never to submit or yield! 
So stirred was Panchos team by this fiery exhortation that 
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandou. Aa 
a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before the half. 
The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludowic, not 
having any football players to choose from, took up with Pancho 
and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they are see 
everywheredancing, holding hands, nuzzling, smoking.
Smoking what? Philip Morris, of corris! e CARN EGG
And for you filter fanciers, the makers of Philip Morris give 
you a lot to like in the sensational Marlborofilter, flavor, 
pack or box. Marlltoro joins Philip Morris in bringing you 
this column throughout the school year.

Blenheim's Unclear Purposes
Dear Blenheim,
I assume that by this time you will have read the en
lightening letter written by one who prefers to be called 
the Gray Ghost. I should like to repeat one of his state
ments. In the future I would ap-*------------------------------------------------
preciate if you would stick closer
to a subject on which you are well 
versed.
It would seem that you prefer 
hearsay and unfounded opinion to 
a direct reportiing of fact or to a 
generalization based upon fact.
Everyone is perfectly welcome to 
Iheir owh opinions; however, I 
would sincerely suggest that you 
do a complete re-evaluation (or 
evaluation) of the things you write 
for hundreds of' people to read 
and be certain in your own mind 
that what you have written is true.
It makes no difference if the writ
ing is biased. Most of your read
ers have come to expect that much 
of you and they dismiss it in order 
to judge the point you make.
Real Purpose
I feel uncertain, however, that 
all of your readers were able to 
make out just what you were 
pointing toward in your most re
cent article. Were you soliciting for 
UNICEF, propounding socialism, 
or selling Volkswagens?
There are some among us (and 
I mean citizens of the U. S.) who 
prefer to work in order to pay 
from a few hundred to a few thou
sand dollars for an automobile 
rather than to give such a sum 
away. Parenthetically, I wonder if 
Ike regards his Cadillacs . . . a 
symbol of attainment for the ma
terialistic and new rich?
Monument
Pertaining to the "grandiose and 
guady moment (erected by the 
way, from wood, cardboard, and 
a borrowed motor) I should again 
suggest that you get your facts 
from a reputable source rather 
than from wild speculations and only through rejecting all values, 
hearsay. No, I shant tell how even your own.

Editor, the Tartan
I would like to bring to the 
surface a hazard that has been 
plaguing our school as long as I 
can remember. Every morning as 
the bell rings signifying the end 
of classes, the halls of both the 
first and second floors of Admin
istration Hall are filled with hun
dreds of wide-eyed freshman girls 
slowly walking along with a for
ward velocity of 5 mph, gabbing 
among themselves, and looking for 
unattached upperclassmen that 
they can meet, date, and jilt.
These meaningful little wenches 
create a roadblock that can be 
penetrated by neither man nor 
machine. Many a time in attempt
ing to get from Porter Hall to the 
GSIA Building, I have been de
layed by this human barricade so 
long that I arrived ten minutes 
late for class.
A solution to this problem 
would be either for the darlings 
to remain in their classrooms un
til the next bell rings, or better 
yet, they could walk along the 
edges of the halls and let those 
of us interested in making our 
next class come up the middle.

Unfounded
Dear Blenheim:
If your brilliant dissertation en
titled Wealth and Poverty was 
intended to arouse a reform move
ment in regard to fraternity dis
plays on Techs campus, I fear 
that through your own stupidity 
you have sadly failed.
Your article was a manifesta
tion of chaotic disorganization, 
based upon unfounded informa
tion, invalid assumptions and ra
tionalized conclusions.
Useless Description 
In your first paragraph you be
gan to hang yourself by offering 
the reader a wordy description of 
a 1959 Cadillac which was less 
than useless since said mentioned 
car was a 1957 model and thus 
could hardly be described as a 
new standard of motoring majes
ty. You went from bad to worse 
in your second incredible para
graph by verbally contradicting 
yourself.
You informed the reader that: 
It is distressing that the economic 
well-being of the U.S. is so de
pendent upon the motoring pub
lics search for annual novelty 
rather than luxurious efficiency. 
After this, you want on to state 
that: While the nations schools 
are physically outmoded, her 
teachers underpaid . . . our best 
minds are concerned primarily 
with the design and production 
of luxuries.
For or Against?
Well, Blenheim, are you or are 
you not in favor of the twice men
tioned luxuries? Certainly, only 
a good guesser would be likely to 
hit upon the correct answer after 
the former jumbled quotations 
from your pen. As a final error, 
you based your whole third para
graph on what you found out 
through enquiry.
Unfortunately, your enquiry 
must have gone no. further than 
listening to Skibo gossops. Had 
you questioned the owners of the 
display, I am certain that you 
would have found the correct ex
penditure to have been well under 
$1,000.
Little Thought
In essence Blenheim, why dont 
you put a little thought into your 
articles and be certain that all of 
your information is correct before 
you begin to write? Had you done 
this last week, you would have 
been saved from your self-imposed 
ridicule evident with the printing 
of your erroneous fiasco.
Lex Baker 59
Gray Ghost
Dear Blenheim,
You are magnicent. Such force
ful thinking. It was uncanny the 
way your last article lifted school 
spirit. I can just picture next 
years homecoming displays and 
football team. The team running 
around scraping Cadillacs for 
charity while the fraternity broth
ers stand on their respective cor
ners with tin cups in their hands.
Blenheim you are babbling 
again. You miss the whole point 
of living in our great democracy 
as well as the true meaning of the 
Cadillac car. The Cadillac is a 
symbol of success much like the 
heros medal in Russia. The Cad
illac is to the man who has ar
rived, as the mint julep is to the 
Kentucky Gentleman (bottled in 
bond, 100 proof).
Free Enterprise 
Take away the Cadillac and 
you destroy our system of fret 
enterprise; for its the finer things 
in life such as big finned cars 
and good booze which supplies 
the added initiative to insure suc
cess in the individuals striving 
for a better standard of living. 
But enough of your attempt to de
stroy General Motors.
School Spirit 
The Tartan has repeatedly chas
tised the student body for their 
lack of school spirit and then you 
come bouncing along, contradict
ing the policy of your paper by 
criticizing an honorable and hon
est effort on the part of the stu
dents to show off their pride for

Autumn Contemplation
As mentioned in the introductory column, Banbuiry Cross 
will occasionally indulge in attempts at belles lettres. This 
is not a propitious withdrawal from the scene of controversy, 
but rather a pause for quiet contemplation on the fading 
autumn scene.
I wandered into an angry autumn storm last night 
Into the howling *
screeching
wind.
The wind hurled itself at the naked trees 
And they
bowed in quivering fear.
The white lightning flashes
showed the gnarled fingers of the
trees in terror 3'
claw and slash at winds soft underside.
The wind assailed the placid pool
And angry waves sprung up and spit and 
spewed their foam
at
the
wind.%The wind frightened all the tiny little creatures 
and they hid quaking in their dens.
The rain came.
It put out the wind.
The trees raised their branch-fingers in 
quiet relief
And drank deeply.
The angry waves were spatted
into ^
gentle
ripples.
The tiny little creatures ceased quaking and slept.
Then the rain stopped
And all was very still and dark.
I returned
quiet
as the night.

Playoffs To Start 
tn IM Football
Fierce competition was shown in 
intramural footballs final week of 
regular season play. The top two 
teams in each league will head 
into the playoffs, however two 
leagues playoff teams are still un
decided.
AJCitcom went through regular 
season play undefeated to gain top 
spot in the Pirate league. They 
won tough games from Kappa 
Sigma by a 17 to 10 score and 
then defeated the Englishmen for 
the crown. Citcom was not even 
cited in pre-season ratings and 
could be the dark-horse of the 
playoffs. Their attack is lead by 
Murphy and Jones.
Tie Game 
0 Second place in the Pirate 
League is still undecided as Kap
pa Sig and The Englishmen fought 
to an 18-18 tie last Thursday and 
are both tied for second place. 
Hildebrand and Casey have been 
leading the K-Sig attack and 
seemed to have built up a big 
enough lead over the Englishmen 
to win. However in the last min
ute of play the E-men scored a 
first down to tie the final score. 
0 Sigma Nu won the Yankee 
League crown by defeating Theta 
Xi 9 to 3 in a battle of the un
beaten?. The loss was TXs first 
of the season and gave them un
disputed possession of second place 
and a berth in the playoffs.
First Down Battle
The game was a battle of first 
downs with SN taking a 2 to 1 
lead at halftime, and 3 to 2 at the 
^nd of three quarters. However in 
Tiie final quarter, a SN tally iced 
the contest. Lew Perretta and Karl 
Mandry stood out both offensively 
and defensively for the SN team 
while end Eddie Davis and Quar
terback Bob Patten lead the TX 
attack.
Some of the best action this year 
has taken place in Brooklyn 
League play where four teams are
standouts. The Met Grads have 
so far waded through play unde
feated beating SAE by 5 points 
and ATO by 2. The SAEs were 
defeated by the Delts 22 to 19. but 
last week the Delts were downed 
by ATO by a 27 to 9 score. To 
complicate matters SAE beat ATO 
7-3 and the Phi Kappas upset the 
Delts 9 to 7.
Three Way Tie
The Met Grads have still to play 
the Delts and if DTD wins the 
final standings will show Met 
Grads still in first place with a 
three way tie fcr second place 
existing between ATO, SAE, and 
the Delts. If the Delts lose how
ever, a two way tie will exist for,, 
second place between SAE an<K 
ATO.
In last weeks play, SAE down
ed ATO in a defensive battle by 
a 7 to 3 score. No touchdowns 
were scored with SAE making 5 
first downs and gaining two points 
on a safety. QB Chuck Vodvarka 
lead the SAEs to their victory 
with sharp passes and fine run
ning.
Crucial Game
ATO defeated Delta Tau Delta 
to keep alive for a playoff berth 
by a 27 to 9 score. Jim Bennet, 
ATO quarterback passed and ran 
well to lead the attack in which 
the ATO defense stood out.
The Met Grads have not played 
for the past two weeks since most 
of their players were busy with 
qualifying exams. They will see 
action against the Delts this week.
It is not yet known whether 
second place ties will be played 
off or whether both teams would 
be given a playoff berth. A lot de
pends on the outcome of the Met 
Grad game with the Delts for if 
the Delts lose, there would be eight 
teams eligible for the playoffs 
which would make for a better 
playoff schedule than the normal 
playoff schedule where six teams 
compete and necessitate giving two 
byes.
Tartans Down  
F&M By 25-14
By Mike Berman
The gridjmen from Tech en
countered light resistance Satur
day in their victory over Frank
lin and Marshall. The Tartans 
soared to their fifth triumph of the 
season against just two defeats 
and a victory that Coach Eddie 
Baker was most skeptic of.
Midway through the first quar
ter Tech was in command of the 
ball on their own 19 yard line. A 
series of neatly executed handoffs and passes, resulted in several 
first downs and netted the Skibos 
some 67 yards bringing them right 
up to the F&M 15 yard marker. 
On the next play, Quarterback 
Jim Muth handed off to halfback 
Leroy McElhinney who crashed 
through tackle and ate up the 15 
yards for a Tartan touchdown. The 
extra point boot by Walt Majeski 
split the uprights and put Tech 
ahead 7 to 0.
In the closing minutes of the 
first quarter, Tartan linebacker 
Carl Benner intercepted an F&M 
pass and ran it back to the visitors 
31. From here the Plaids punctur
ed the Diplomats defense and 
marched to their one yard line 
where Muth sneaked over for the 
score. A running attempt failed to 
make the extra two points and 
Tech lead at halftime 13 to 0.
Tuird Quarter
The third frame was marked by 
many punt exchanges resulting in 
a deadlocked quarter. The Tartans 
bounced right back for more early 
in the final stanza fullback Gary 
Jones bowled over from the one 
for the third Skibo TD. The Dip[continued on page 6]

0Harriers Down WVU
Last Tuesday in their final 
scheduled dual meet of the season 
the Tartan cross-country team 
swept to an 18-43 victory over the 
University of West Virginia. Run
ning easily and finishing very 
strong, Dick Hamilton and Eric 
Ottervik paced the field; they 
crossed the tape together in record 
^ime of 24-01. Bill Wittman, how 
in previous meets has run right 
with the record breaking duo, was 
hampered by a painful case of shin 
splints. Still running on sheer de
sire, he placed third in the meet, 
was ahead of the first WVU man.
In fourth place for Tech was 
junior Bill Anderson. Voted the 
teams most valuable underclass
man, Bill has improved tremend
ously in the past season. He has 
e n running consistently in 
fourth place for Tech behind Ham
ilton, Ottervik and Wittman, the 
senior record-breakers. If he 
keeps improving at his present 
rate, he looks like a sure bet for 
next years first man. Close behind 
Anderson eome Techs Bruce Dob
ras. A converted football player, 
Bruce has done exceptionally well 
in this his first season of cross
country. Overcoming his lack of 
experience with plenty of hard 
training, Bruce has improved 
steadily all season. Next season he 
promises to be one of the top run
ners on the teams.
Senior Woody Fritz placed next 
for Tech. Lettering for his third 
straight year, Woody is Techs 
steadiest and most consisent run
ner. Along with the other seniors 
his performance will be sorely 
missed by the team.
The victory was a fine team ef
fort with Techs first seven men 
qoming in under 27 minutes, very 
good time for the hard Schenley 
Park course. This gives Tech an 
outstanding dual meet record of 
8-1, the only loss being a protested 
24-33 defeat at the hands of Slip
pery Rock.
With the dual meet season over, 
the team now plans to enter sev
eral nationally open AAU meets 
during the coming weeks. Also 
tentative plans have been drawn 
up for a West Penn Invitational 
meet to be held in Schenley Park 
on November 14. The definite de
tails have not been established as 
yet, however.
Riflers Win 
Two Matches
The Carnegie Tech varsity rifle 
team stands in first place in the 
Greater Pittsburgh Intercollegiate 
Rifle League. The team won its 
first two matches of the season 
against two of its toughest op
ponents, Washington & Jefferson 
College and West Virginia Univer
sity. The results were:
October 10th at TechCIT 1410 
W&J 1393.
October 25th at WVUCIT 1414 
WVU 1400.
Team Coach 
The varsity team is coached by 
Master Sergeant Eugene D. Vaugh
an. This is M/Sgt. Vaughans 
third year as coach. The team cap
tain is Victor L. Polansky now in 
his fourth year with the team.
Last year the team was the win
ner in the Greater Pittsburgh In
tercollegiate Rifle League, Western 
Pennsylvania Conference and In
tercollegiate sectional competition.
Polansky, a physics major from 
Swissvale, was national intercol
legiate champion in 1957, and was 
voted All American for 1957 and 
1958.
Carman Wins AAU 
30 Kilometer Race 
And Championship
Carnegie Techs running track 
and cross country coach, Bob Carm*an, sped to the National AAU 
30 Kilometer championship at 
York, Pa., two weekends ago. In 
cold, 40 degree weather and a 
driving rain Coach Carman bat
tled his way over the 30 Km (18 
mile) course to win in excellent 
time.
When it was all over, Carman 
said, It was the toughest race of 
'my life. It goes without saying 
that it was his best! He was 
pushed all the way by some of 
the nation's top long distance runchampion it was a great and exners. Besides becoming a national 
citing victory for Caraan. This 
gives him two outstanding per
formances in the last month. 
Formerly a 6 miler, Bob has 
switched to the longer distances 
only recently.
Several weeks ago he placed 
second in the New Jersey Nation
al Marathon. Now he has become 
(the National 30 Km champ.
More buxom blondes with

Tech vs. F&M
The Tartans coasted to an easy 25-14 victory.
Pershing Rifles is a military 
fraternity whose purposes are to 
increase interest and proficiency in 
the work of the basic corps of 
R.O.T.C. The Carnegie Tech com
pany has been one of the out

lomats had held strongly at their 
own one yard line for three plays 
before Jones took it over. A pass 
attempt was no good for the extra 
points and Tech lead 19 to 0.
With Tech holding a 19 point 
advantage over scoreless F&M in 
the fourth quarter Coach Eddie 
Baker substituted freely and rest
ed his regulars. The Diplomats 
took advantage of the slightly less 
experienced Tartan line and scor
ed two TDs in a matter of min
utes, separated only by a Tartan 
score.
One of the F&M tallies came 
late in the game when safety 
John Kooser intercepted a Tartan 
aerial and marched it 23 yards to 
the Skibos 40. Just seconds later, 
F&M back Fred Hesse smashed 
through from the Tartan 3 for the 
F&M ice breaker. A pass play 
from Tom Kirkup to End Dave 
Yelovich was good for the two 
point conversion cutting Techs 
lead to eleven, 19-8.
The Finale 
The game ended up in a flare 
cf touchdowns with one being 
scored by each team. Carnegies 
came shortly after the previous 
Diplomat touchdown. Taking to 
the air, Tartan quarterback Pete 
Boxsein hit halfback Charles 
Mueller for a 26 yard score. An
other running attempt for the two 
extra points wras foiled giving the 
Plaids a 25 to 8 lead with a little 
over one minute to play. The final 
F&M score came when back Tom 
Kirkup heaved a 39 yard pass to 
Fred Hesse for the score account
ing for the 25-14 victory.

Music, Drama 
At Playhouse
The production of Maxwell An
dersons musical dramatization, 
Lost in the Stars, is now in 
progress at the Playhouse.
^'he metropolitan press critics 
had.this to say about it: It is 
fine, live vibrating theater 
(Monahan-Press), Mr. Weills 
score is brilliant in its stately 
crescendo of anguish and sad
ness. (Cohen  Post-Gazette), 
and should easily rate among 
the all-time achievements at the
mmunity theater. (Mendlo'tzSun-Telegraph).
Anniversary Season 
It is with this reception that 
the Playhouse Hamlet St. Thea
ter entered into the 25th anni
versary season.
The Pittsburgh community the
ater is presenting Lost in the 
Stars for the most discriminating 
of its theater goersfor it is not 
show for those who desire 
just an evenings entertaining, but 
for those who will relish an awe
some and poignant tale with a 
background of music and voices 
that are thrilling to the soul.
Chorus
From the moment the curtain 
rises to the haunting voices of 
the chorus with its beautifully or
chestrated narration of life andt
ath in South Africa to the final 
>ments of dramtic tenseness as 
a father experiences the death 
of his only son, Lost in the 
Stars leads its audience through 
the gamut of human experience 
and emotions.
The Playhouse management, 
produced Lost in the Stars for 
an intellectual audience. It be
lieves that there is an audience 
for such a show. Lost in theS
tars is not for people who 
lould prefer Can-Can.
Reduced Rates 
The Playhouse also points out 
that reduced rates are available 
for this show as well as any other 
production. Any group of 25 or 
more is eligible for a reduction in 
ticket prices and the privilege of 
using the Playhouse Gallery Res
taurant. The group ticket reduc
tion plan is also used for fund 
Raising benefits for any organizawjn wishing to raise money. Lost 
in the Stars offer an unusual op
portunity, because of its nature, 
to the fund raising organization.

tinue in the Hamlet St. Theater 
until November 22. Tickets may 
be reserved by phoning MAyflower 1-4445.

their institution and Its traditions.
The expenditure of $1000 on the 
part of the fraternal orders is 
minor when you compare it to the 
expenditure of time, effort, and 
plain cotton-pickin hard work 
that went into welcoming back 
our alumni.
What would you -have us do? 
What constructive suggestions do 
you have for the student body? 
As my old grandpappv back on 
the plantation would say, Its 
mighty easy to pull apart the cot
ton, but it takes quite a man to 
make a broadcloth. In other words 
Yankee, go home.
The Gray Ghost
Blenheim, Reveal 
Source Of Facts
Blenheim:
We were quite disturbed by your 
last article, Wealth and Poverty, 
and we dont quite understand 
just what your objectives were. 
Having taken the liberty to as
sume by your words that you were 
referring to the display of one 
fraternity, in particular, on the 
corner of Morewood and Forbes, 
we challenge you to state the 
source of your statement that en
quiry revealed that the costs in
volved were well over $1,000. 
Because the article was found 
on the editorial page, and because 
the paper is representative of the 
student body and you are repre
sentative of the paper, may we 
go so far as to further assume 
that your article is representative 
of the thinking of the student 
body? We sincerely hope not.
Since there is no set budget on 
fraternity homecoming displays, 
whose business is it how much a 
house spends on their display? 
If your goal was to curb expenses 
on these annual displays, dont
you think that your words were 
unfair, especially since your argu
ment was not based on fact. Per
haps you meant that the display 
in question was worth well over 
$1,000 of brotherhood, coopera
tion, spirit, sportsmanship, and 
perseverance, rather than cost 
well over $1,000. This is a far 
more accurate statement.
Alums
What the point was of mention
ing the name of the fraternity 
house in front of which the 1959 
model Cadillac automobile was 
situated, seems doubtful. We can
not find a connection between the 
two as there were a great number 
of alumni, their cars, and too few 
parking places. If we may as
sume it belonged to an alum, 
then more credit to him and the 
education that helped him earn 
money to buy that car!
You did compliment this fra
ternity by the logical approach to 
your problem. May we say that 
you inferred; manifestation of 
wealth is prevalent among the 
powerful. This particular fratern
ity (on the corner of Morewood 
and Forbes) showed, what you 
believed to be, an manifestation 
of wealth. Therefore, this fratern
ity is powerful!
Real Problem
Perhaps we have now struck 
the bottom of the problem! Peo
ple naturally fear power in oth
ers, especially a strongly united 
power. And perhaps certain 
groups have let this fear lead them 
to do childish things.
May we set forth those words 
upon which our country was 
founded: All men are created
equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unal
ienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness.
May we please respect these 
words, and stop being petty.

Congress
[continued from page 2J 
ing was taken up by the discus
sion of a few items under old 
and new business.
Jazz Concert 
The first controversaial issue 
was that of the Executive Coun
cils veto of Playton Mandros 
motion which was passed at the 
October 22 meeting: That Student 
Congress approve the Spring Car
nival Committees having a jazz 
concert on campus providing this 
concert does not cost Student 
Congress any money.
The councils major criticisms 
of this motion were that it was 
vague, it did not make provision 
for tax on tickets or the cost of 
police supervision, and that the 
names, of the entertainment
wouldnt be known until after the 
signing of the contract. After 
lengthy discussion, it was sug
gested that possibly a committee 
could be appointed to work with 
Playton in order to investigate the 
details of the proposed plan 
further.
Supreme Court
Under new business, Fred Heider of the' Supreme Court inter
preted Supreme Courts decision 
about its appeal procedure. By this 
decision, it stated that it would 
not hear an appeal from the Coun
cil of Fraternity Presidents Court 
of Justice because it has faculty 
members on it, and thus is not a 
student court.
The motions that were passed at 
this meeting were: That $836 be 
loaned to Scabbard and Blade for 
the 1958-59 Military Ball, being 
repayed by Scabbard and Blade ;
-----------------------------------------------0
within one week after the Ball, 
Also, any losses up to $200 will 
be paid within one week after the 
Military Ball.
It was moved that a letter of 
thanks be written by Student Con
gress to Mr. & Mrs. Hoy A Hunt 
expressing the appreciation of the 
student body for their generous 
gift of the new library.
In addition it was' moved thsri 
Student Congress approve H 
budget of the leadership cpnference committee for $10.25.
A motion was made that $40 be 
appropriated for the Kiltie Band 
to provide for transportation for a 
group of approximately 30 band 
members to the Westminster foot
ball game to be held on November
15, 1958.
