NOTED STARS APPEAR IN RED CROSS PAGEANT
The upper classmen of the Drama 
Department of Design School have re
turned from their "great adventure 
in New York, but Mr.' Stevens is 
afraid that the experience will con
tinue to prove so exciting that no 
actual work can be dono for a week. 
The trip was made for the purpose of 
producing a Pageant, at Huntington, 
Long Island, part of which consisted 
of Mr. Stevens "The Drawing of the 
Sword," and the students went along 
to understudy the stars who appeared 
in the roles which they "created last 
spring. Ethel Barrymore, E. H. Sotliern, and a number of other Avellknown actors appeared on Friday 
afternoon, but on account of matinees 
could not be present on Saturday. The 
students were thus given the oppor
tunity to play roles, interpretations of 
which by the greatest artists in the

DRAMATIC DEPARTMENT REHEARSING NEW PLAYS
The Drama Department has two Gil
bert plays, "Engaged and Sweet
hearts, under rehearsal. Mr. Stevens 
expects to resume rehearsals of "At
lanta and Caledon, started last 
spring, and to produce, also, in the 
near future, a Japanese mask, which 
will cast about 20 people. Mr. Payne 
is expected soon, bringing several 
short plays from New York.
SCALZO AND LA MARCA DIRECT MUSICAL CLUBS
Lust Sunday afternoon, the Carne
gie Musical Clubs had their first 
meetings About fifty men turned out 
to show their ability along musical 
lines. Sovoral good men were found 
for the mandolin Club, but the num
ber of men that turned out was not 
nearly sufficient to fill all the vacan
cies.
Mr. Scalzo was on hand and tried 
out the men for the Mandolin Club, 
while Mr. La Marca hud charge of the 
men in the Glee Club. Mr. La MUrcii 
is studying expression in the Design 
School on Iho udvico of Caruso; the 
world-fnmous tenor. Ho hns a splen
did tenor voice, and understands music 
thoroughly, having hud u wide range 
of experience with the great artists. 
No doubt, with these two able men aa 
directors, the musicul clubs muy look 
forward to a successful senson.

DESIGN SCHOOL GIRLS GAVE TEA AND DANCE
On Friday, October 5, the Sopho
more Girls of Design School gave a 
tea. in honor of the incoming students. 
Two girls from each department 
served on the introduction and recep
tion committee. Miss Anna T. Bennett, 
secretary of the Design School, 
poured. The tea was followed by an 
informal dance, to which the boys 
were invited.
"Youre going to buy a Liberty 
Bond, aren't you?" You will be as 
sailed by one of the seventeen M. M.
C. S. Secretarial girls, out on the Oc
tober campaign to solicit Liberty 
Bonds in the four schools and Car
negie Library. They will visit the 
heads of the - departments, and the 
faculty, and reach the students 
through assembly. At the big Library, 
thejr will make the rounds of the dif
ferent departments.
Under the leadership of Mrs. Burch
field and her aids, the girls also in
tend to sell Bonds for three consecu
tive Saturdays in the down-town de
partment stores. This is their appeal:
The least you can do for your 
country is to buy a bond. You are 
not giving a gift to the Government 
it is an investment for which you will 
Tje paid the same amount of-interest 
your savings in the bank draw. When 
Uncle Sam needs a few dollars are 
you going to shirk your duty? If not, 
hunt up a girl with a tri-colored rib
bon on her arm. She has a subscrip
tion blank ready for you. Sign it and 
in this way, help protect your home, 
your country, and bring the war to a 
speedy close."
FORMER FOOTBALL STAR1 LEADS REGIMENT RAND
The Eighteenth Regiment band ren
dered a concert near the Confederate 
monument herelast evening. The 
playing of the organization was much 
appreciated. So large was the crowd 
that traffic was interfered with. Band
master Frank E. Altdoerfer, formerly 
Tech varsity fullback, Was in charge 
of the band. Brigadier General Price 
has arranged a schedule of concerts 
for the city, one each day by the 13 
bands of the division.
GET TOGETHER SMOKER PROVES GREAT SUCCESS
On Friday evening of October 5, at 
8 o'clock, the Middle Men of the School 
of Applied Industries gave a smoker 
in honor of the new Plebe Class of 
that school. The meeting took place 
in the Gymnasium.
After the distribution of smokes, 
piano and vocal selections, introduc
tions, and a general good time ensued. 
The entertainment consisted of vari
ous numbers, including some rather in
teresting scenes of Tech life "a la 
movie," a wrestling match in which 
Kid McCarthy downed the redoubt
able Williams twice in as many falls. 
Prof., O-No, from Japan, assisted by 
Mr. Carlson, of the new class, demon
strated the Japanese art af self-de
fense, the jui-jitsu, much to the inter
est of the audience.
Mr. Pfants, however, instructor in 
the art of pattern-making, proved 
to be the sensation of the evening. Mr. 
Pfants, better known as "Bill," to his 
countless friends throughout the 
school, was booked for "something 
worth while." "Bill" has yet to dis
appoint his listeners.
Mr. H. Adams, president of the 
Middle Class, next called upon Mr. 
David, of the Physics Department, to 
say a few words. Mr. David does not

FORBES HALL TO HAVE STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Ati a meeting of the Forbes Hall oc
cupants, called last evening, by the 
order of Prof. Esquirre. house rules 
were discussed and a temporary presi
dent elected. The honor system was 
explained to the girls. Everyone was 
enthused over the thought of a defi
nite organization. It is hoped that 
the girls will take the responsibility 
upon themselves to obey all rules and 
to co-operate with the house president 
so that Forbes Hall will be an ideal 
example of student government.

DR. BLAIR OF M. M. C. S. LEAVING FOR FRANCE
At the regular Student Assembly, 
last Wednesday, Dr. Esther Blair, head 
of the Physical Education Depart
ment at M. M. C. S., overwhelmed the 
girls by announcing her intention of 
leaving for France within a week. Dr. 
Blair will leave with the first Civilian 
Relief Unit of the Red Cross that has 
left -/:fnerica. Its work is to care for 
the women and children in the recon
quered territory. These people,' for 
three years, have had scarcely enough 
to keep body and soul together, have 
been practically without shelter, have 
had no accessible medical aid and far, 
far, too many of them have been the 
victims of indescribably horrible bar
baric treatment.
Dr. Blair, entirely thrilled with feel
ing and sympathy for these people 
who have helped fight our battle, ap
pealed to the school for support. A 
little sacrifice on our parts can do so 
much for the people of Belgium, Hol
land and France, who are in utter des
olation. Old clothes, shoes and any
thing good enough to repair, can be 
mended and sent directly to Dr. Blair 
for distribution. Red Cross activities 
ought to be booming in the "Institu
tion," she said, and we cannot spend 
enough time thinking up new ideas 
for relief work.
We expect Dr. Blair back for the be
ginning of the fall term in 1918.
FORMER DRAMA STUDENT APPEARS AT DUQUESNE
The Tartan Is in receipt of a letter 
from Mr. Fred Jackson, author of 
Baa, Baa, Black Sheep, which will 
open at the Duquesne Theater next 
week, and in which Charles H. Mere
dith will appear. Everyone will be 
pleased to learn of the success of Mr. 
Meredith, who was especially active 
and popular while at Tech.
Mr. Jackson says: I thought it
might interest you to know that a 
former member of Tech is returning 
to the city in a rather new and inter
esting capacity. He is Charles H. 
Meredith, who, I believe, was very 
active in athletics, having won his 
letters in track and basket ball and 
having been elected captain of the 
1917 basket ball team. Mr. Meredith 
was for three years a student in the 
Dramatic Department, and I'm sure 
there are still some who remember 
Shanahan, who eats no meat. I be
lieve he also served as athletic editor 
of The Tartan, and was one of the 
founders of the Puppet. He is a mem
ber of the Zi Sigma Upsilon Frater
nity.
Mr. Meredith is coming to the Du
quesne Theater for two weeks, begin(Continued on Page Two.)
CABINET OF Y. M. C. A. CALLS FIRST MEETING
The first regular meeting of the Y. 
M. C. A. will be held in Room 67, Sci
ence Building, on Wednesday, October
4, at 4 oclock. The Y. M. C. A. cab
inet has been hard hit by the war, 
there being only three of the old men 
left in school; but notwithstanding 
this, steps have already been taken 
for the reopening of the Bible classes 
which were so successful last year. 
The pastors of the Oakland churches, 
through the Y. M. C. A., are getting in 
touch with the new men from out of 
town and plans are being made for 
the establishment of a correspondence 
club for the purpose of keeping in 
touch with the students in military 
service.
The Cabinet needs men for active 
work to take the places of those called 
away. All students interested in Y. 
M. C. A. work are invited to attend the 
meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
LEVINSON INTERFERING FOR EARLYARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR COLLEGE NIGHT
The Tech Varsity made an excel
lent showing against the formidable 
Army team. Tech was vastly out
weighed in both avoirdupois and foot
ball experience. It is only necessary 
to look at the records of the various 
Cadet players, to see that the green" 
Tech team fought valiantly. Oli
phant, the Army right half, has played 
at Furdue and West Point and won a 
place on Walter Camps first AllAmerican team last year. "Full back 
McQuarrie, a former University of 
Montana football captain, was respon
sible for most of the guins through 
the Tech line nnd VandegrafC, an erst
while All-Southern tackle, made sev
eral long runs. Tech played men who 
have only had high school experience 
and one man who never played before 
this Fall. Against such opponents 
the results of the game w'ere quite 
creditable.
For Tech Early starred on the of
fensive, making three first downs on 
shift plays from punt formation. 
"Corey" Gretzler played well on the 
defensive, intercepting one of Olipliants forward passes, which prevent
ed an additional touchdown. Oli(Contlnued on Pago Four.)

TEAM PREPARING FOR HARD GAME SATURDAY
Coach Steffen is expecting stiff op
position from Westminster in the first 
game of the season on Tech Field, 
Saturday. Westminster, though light, 
fought hard against tho heavy W. & J. 
tenm lust Snturdny, holding them to n 
36 to 0 score. The same brnnd of 
footbnll may offer serious difficulties 
to the light Tech outfit.
The injuries sustained by Enrly, 
Levinson nnd Williams in tho Army 
'game also present a new difficulty. 
Levinsons shoulder wus budly in
jured in tnckling Vnndegruff, nnd both 
players were removed to tho Army 
Hospital. Although ho returned with 
the team, It is feared that his shoulder 
blnde wus broken. "Vet" Wllllums

GIRLS SOLICIT FOR BONDS
The girls oi! the Secretarial Department of the Margaret Morri
son School are out to solicit subscriptions for the Second Liberty 
Loan of 1917. Part of their work will consist of an appeal to the 
student assemblies and a personal canvas of the members of the 
faculty and of the employees of the whole Carnegie Institute. The 
other part will be public solicitation for the bonds in some of the 
downtown stores.
Every man or woman whom they reach should give the matter 
serious consideration. Remember that these girls are no longer 
merely studentsthey arc representatives of the United States Gov
ernment. Their appeal gives in the concrete a summary of all that 
has been or can be said about the war. They say with Secretary 
McAdoo: America is fighting for her vital rights. She is fighting 
to protect her citizens against assassination and murder on the high 
seas. She is fighting to preserve her democratic institutions and her 
sovereignty as a nation. She is fighting for the noble idea of univer
sal democracy and liberty. -She is fighting for peace, for that just 
and lasting peace which agonized humanity craves.
Not only that, but these girls arc going to say to you, Men are 
fighting. What are you doing to help them?
Much its every student would like to help, it is obvious that the 
average man at Tech is totally unable to buy by himself even the 
smallest denomination of bond. However, that does not preclude the 
possibility of students .'joining together for that purpose. Might it 
not be possible for a class or a school to take a small subscription 
from each man so that the total amount would be enough to procure 
a bond If This could be lel!t at the school, and the proceeds from 
principal and 4 per cent interest devoted at some time in the future 
to mi object which the participants select now
ICven il! nothing comes ol! that, every man is certainly able to 
jisk his folks about their prospects for buying a bond, and to urge 
them to do so. The employees ol' the Institute are in a position to do 
justice to the appeal ol! the girls with the red, white and blue arm
bands. The people whom they meet downtown should help.
IVuy a bond!
FOOTBALL DANCE AND TECH NIGHT
Friday and Saturday evenings of this week present two excellent 
social opportunities. The first football dance of the year is to be held 
on Friday night in Carnegie Union. The money realized from the 
admission fees of one dollar will be devoted to the many objects of 
the Athletic Association. Football at Tech needs financial support 
just as much as student backing at the games, and this year the need 
is even greater because of decreased enrollment. There is no better 
way to help the sport than by paying the admission fee on Friday 
night, and no better way to get into the mood for the first home game 
than by your attendance there with your companion for Saturday 
afternoon.
On Saturday evening it has been arranged through the agency 
of The Tartan for the Westminster and Tech football teams to occupy 
boxes at the Schenley Theater. The manager of the theater has 
agreed to have the school cheer leader take charge, and yells and a 
general good time will be permitted between the acts. The produc
tion for this week is The Chocolate Soldier. Tickets for Saturday 
evening are being sold by student agents for twenty-five, fifty, and 
seventy-five cents. This affair, just as much as the football dance, 
deserves the support of eveiy man who can afford it.
The aerial of the wireless set has been taken down during the sum
mer. Since the Radio Club was no longer allowed to use the set, 
probably the only disadvantage incurred in removing the aerial is 
the fact that the Plebes will have to build a new place to hang their 
banner.

by those Plebes at M. M. C. S. who 
have been "bunking in the gymnas

Forbes Hall.
This dance was in the nature of a 
farewell party as Friday was moving 
clay. Miss Browning and Miss Gail 
Sellers were chaprones. Although 
there was much enthusiasm about the 
new rooms in Forbes Hall, there is 
much regret among the Plebes about 
leaving their jolly quarters in the

SUCCESSFUL YEAR IN VIEW FOR TECH BAND
Our Band looks more promising this 
year than ever before. About twenty 
old men have already reported to 
Manager Smith, and more are expect
ed. With all these old men back the 
management expects to have a band 
of thirty-five pieces.
However, there is plenty room for 
more musicians. There are no doubt 
plenty of men around school who can 
play some band instrument. There 
are many pieces needed, such as altos, 
basses, trombones and clarinets. Some 
of these instruments are furnished and 
it is a poor excuse for a man to say he 
does not have his instrument with 
him.
The management has again secured 
Mr. E. F. Sullivan to direct the band 
this year. There are many engage
ments on hand and it is expected that 
the boys will be on hand for the foot
ball games, assemblies, parades and 
many other numerous demonstrations.
There are also several officers to be 
elected and all old men should come

FORMER DRAMA STUDENT
APPEARS AT DUQUESNE
(Continued From Page One.) 
ning October 15, with the above pro
duction. This is the first time that 
Mr. Meredith has returned to Pitts
burgh since leaving school last June, 
a year ago. He has made -rapid 
strides in the profession and has been 
a great help to Mr. DeHaven and me 
in all departments of the production. 
He has designed and supervised the 
execution of the scenery, is stage-director and in addition is playing a part 
which is, unfortunately, not com
mensurate with his histrionic ability. 
I am planning to use Mr. Meredith in 
some large parts in my coming pro
ductions, and hope that his friends in 
school and in Pittsburgh will have 
many opportunities of witnessing his 
splendid portrayals.
"Having been born and raised in 
Pittsburgh myself, it gives me great 
pleasure to recount to you the success 
and promise of another Pittsburgher, 
and particularly a Techite, and be
lieve his friends would appreciate it 
very much if you could let them know 
through the medium of your paper 
what splendid things he is doing.

like speeches and responded with a 
heart to heart talk to the boys. Dean 
Connelley took Noise as his theme 
and his words carried a punch that 
was useless to attempt to overlook. 
It was not long before every one of 
his audience was imbued with that 
same enthusiasmthat some resolve 
to make a noise" that has so char
acterized the head of the Industry 
School in all his undertakings.
The evening was brought to a close 
by a repast of dogs. ginger-snaps, 
doughnuts and cider, a few cheers led 
by Messrs. Yergey and Kellerman, and 
an exhortation from Mr. Reiser, presi
dent of the Assembly, to get into the 
spirit of the school and become true 
Carnegie clansmen.
Great credit is due to Messrs. Avery, 
Yergey and Batman, the committee 
who had charge of the affair, on the 
manner in which the entertainment 
was conducted.
TEAM PREPARING FOR
HARD GAME SATURDAY
(Continued From Page One.)
At the game on Saturday, the final 
choice for cheerleader between Pafenbach, Stark, and Yergey will be made 
by the . committee in charge. Al
though there was a large crowd pres
ent at the meeting in 209 Science, last 
Saturday, to hear the returns of the 
game, some of the committee were 
absent and no choice was made for 
cheerleader. The meeting, however, 
cheered well, as did the gathering at 
the Union Station the Thursday be
fore. That crowd was one of the 
most enthusiastic that Tech has pro
duced for many months. After the 
team left the rooters paraded around 
the city and practically owned the 
town.

A motion picture was taken of the 
whole Pageant, and the returns from 
its exhibition, together with the re'

make a noticeable addition to the Red

Mr. .Stevens . certainly deserves 
praise for the time and trouble he has 
taken to make this stupendous under

LAWTOCHFRARIE HOLDS IMPORTANT MEETING
Tonight the retiring members of the 
Lawtochfrarie Sophomore Society will 
holdHheir final meeting. Unfortunate
ly only five of the ten men selected for 
this years active membership have 
returned to school. They are Foxon, 
Wenning, Emerich, Giffen, and Mar
tin. What is to be done in regard to 
the other five members will be consid
ered tonight.
The Lawtochfrarie is an organiza
tion in the Sophomore Class of the Sci
ence School. The ten Plebes who are 
most active in class and school af
fairs during their first year are chosen 
to form the society during their Sopho
more year. The purposes of the so-' 
ciety are several in number. First, it 
provides some incentive for work in 
activities among the first year men 
It undoubtedly means a sacrifice for 
any man to engage in activities, es
pecially in his first year, and election 
to the Lawtochfrarie is one means of 
honoring him for that. Second, the 
society provides a means of fellowship 
between the more active men of the 
class. Men who do engage in activ
ities are >tten so busy in their own 
line that they get out of touch with 
other affairs. The society remedies 
this to a great extent. Third, like all 
honorary societies, it provides a means 
for backing up the enterprises of the 
class.

Courage.
Tenacity of will, or willfulness, lies 
at the root of all courage, but courage 
can rise Into true manliness only when 
the will is surrendered, and the more 
absolute the surrender of the will the 
more perfect will be the teniper of our 
courage and the strength of our man

UNION STATION RINGS WITH ROOTERS CHEERS
Parade Through City After 
Team Leaves Practical
ly Owns Town
Last Thursday evening several liundren students assembled at the Union 
Station to see the team leave for West 
Point. The rooters formed a circle in 
the enclosure outside of the station 
and gave the members of the team a 
royal welcome as they arrived. The 
cheerleaders took turns at leading in 
cheers until almost train time, when 
the calls for Coach Steffen became so 
insistent that the whole crowd surged 
into the station in search of him. In
side the cheerleaders again brought 
considerable noise out of the crowd 
until the coach arrived. A speech 
from him was insisted upon, but all 
he would say was that he would let 
the team do his talking for him. The 
players had to rush for the train and 
the crowd followed them to the gate, 
almost blocking up that part of the 
station.
Afterward a parade was formed 
which started down toward Liberty. 
They stopped for a cheer and then pro
ceeded along Liberty avenue, where 
they managed to pick up a band of, 
rather nondescript variety. Led by 
the band the parade zig-zagged back 
and forth across the car-tracks, com
pletely blocking traffic. A cheer was 
given in front of the office of the Pitts
burgh Post and Sun, and the parade 
started along Wood street, pursuing 
the same tactics. They then turned 
up Fifth avenue, and even managed 
to congest traffic there in spite of the 
one policeman whom they met all 
evening. The route of march then led 
back in the original direction along 
Smithfield street, while a hat to hat 
collection was taken up for the band. 
At Smithfield and Liberty a farewell 
cheer was given for the band, the 
parade marched back a little way and 
disbanded.
It has been many a long day since a 
group of students have possessed the 
town so completely. A riot call was 
expected almost every minute, but as 
has been said only one officer of the 
law was encountered all evening. Due 
to the efforts of the cheerleaders 
everyone was hoarse the next morn
ingbut it was worth it.
RESULTS OF ARMY GAME WERE RECEIVED BY WIRE
Cheerleaders Were Not Cho
sen; Will Be Selected 
Saturday
Saturday afternoon there was a 
meeting in Room 209, Scionce, to hoar 
the returns of the Army game. The 
returns were received by telophono 
from the -Tri-State Nows Bureau, 
where they came in by wire. Mes
sages were delayed nearly a half bout 
instead of the expected few minutes, 
because there was no telegraph office 
on the field at. West Point. The mes
sages had be carried about four 
blocks o.utsftfe the field.
While waiting for the first message, 
the three cheerleaders held their com
petition, alternating in leading cheers. 
It was expected that the chief cheer
leader would be chosen that after
noon, but. owing to the fact that sev
eral members of the selecting commit
tee were absent, no decision was 
reached. The final choice between 
Pafenbach, Yergey, and Stark will be 
made after observing their work next 
Saturday.
The returns of the game began to 
come in about 3:45, the first being the 
line-up. As soon as they were written 
down by Brandin and Rice, who oper
ated the telephone, a diagram was 
placed on the board showing the 
progress. Between quarters the dia
gram was explained. The last of the 
game, arrived about 5:15, with the 
score 28-0.
