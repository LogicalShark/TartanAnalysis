Color Phenomenon 
Is Shown Today
Herbert Strong 
Displays Work 
In New Field
Unless youre hopelessly color 
blind you will enjoy the assembly 
today at 11:30 in the theater, Col
lege of Fine Arts.
Mr. Herbert Thompson Strong, 
color consultant of the New York 
Museum of Science and Industry, 
will be here to talk on Explor
ing the Magic World of Color. As 
a special feature Miss Carolyn 
Miller will' model brilliant cos
tumes under a new powerful 
source of ultra-violet light.
Several years ago Mr. Strong, a 
designer of fabrics, took up the 
study of the science of color 
merely as a hobby. From differ
ent parts of the world he collect
ed specimens of natures colors 
in birds, butterflies, minerals, 
jewels, etc. Then he began to 
study the phenomena of color by
Carolyn Miller
the use of ultra-violet rays and 
polarized light.
To the scientist the polariscope 
transforms the shorter invisible 
rays into the longer visible ones. 
To Mr. Strong it is a magic ray 
that can transform ordinary rock 
into a cluster of colors that seem

small glass slides which show 
nothing but an almost clear cir

thin layers of crystals between 
the slides.
With the microscope Mr. Strong 
gets effects just as interesting. 
From a little depression in a

Lack of Spirit 
Causes Failure 
Of Arts Ball
Honorary Group 
Unable To Arouse 
Sufficient Interest
By M. R.
Did you know how exclusive 
the Arts Ball was? It was so ex
clusive that even the Arts stu
dents didnt get in. In fact, no 
one got in.
According to posters in Arts 
School the reason for the failure 
of the Ball was the prevalence of 
flu, colds and strep infections 
which incapacitated the commit
tee members. Or should we say 
Arts Ball Honorary members?
It seems that the students as 
a whole didnt consider the Arts 
Ball important enough, or nec
essary enough to be anything but 
an expensive amusement, and 
didnt consider the fact that the 
Ball is more than thatit is a 
project of all departments of the 
Arts School.
Superior publicity, earlier dis
tribution of tickets, and a willing
ness on the part of more stu
dents to spend more time in 
preparation helped to put the last 
ball over. Nevertheless, at the 
time that tickets went on sale it 
was no better off than the ball 
this year. Then, committee mem
bers underwrote the affair, but 
this year the administration did 
not permit them to do so.
One reason for the failure of 
the ball may be that formerly it 
was purely a spontaneous affair, 
in which a few people interested 
in having an Arts Ball got to
gether and did the work willing
ly with the help of interested vol
unteers. This time, however, an 
attempt was made to run it on an 
organized basis which eliminated 
the spontaneity of spirit.
Obituary: 
Co-op Dorm
Deceased
Unexpected Failure 
Brings Hardships 
To Interested Men
By Charles Fouhy
Died, last Monday, of acute in
difference and complications re
sulting from chronic mismanage
ment and gross inefficiency, the co
operative dormitory, Miller Hall.
The fatal illness set in rather 
suddenly. The deceased was in 
apparent good health, having been 
endowed last September with 
every advantage necessary for 
complete success and fullness of 
life. Quite naturally a long life 
had been expected, yet the recent 
sickness resulted in a total re
lapse. Attempts to revive the 
unfortunate deceased failed and it 
is now, beyond all doubt, def
initely and completely dead.
The autopsy revealed that the 
main cause of the unhappy 
demise was not lack of coopera
tion but lack of the spirit of co
operation. To make the experi
ment work, a certain factor of 
enthusiasm, of belief in the prac
ticability of an idea, was neces
sary. At first nearly everyone 
in the house was-imbued with this 
idea, but gradually the enthusiasm 
faded.
There were many difficulties; 
how to lower the cost of food, who 
was to clean and when, who to 
wait on table and when, who was 
to buy the food and who was to 
pay for it. These were some of 
the obstacles met. All of them 
were overcome and still the idea 
died. What happened? This: the 
fellows just got tired of, it all. 
They couldnt take it; they didnt 
believe in it enough to make it 
worth their while to go on with 
it.
The men who wanted to carry 
on were unable to do so without 
new blood. The thing just up n 
died, a victim of the mental intertia of the Carnegie Campus.

Election Features 
Votes for Carnival 
Revue, Snow Queen
A1 Donoliuc   * 
Junior Prom 
To Present 
Snow Queen
A1 Donohues Hand, 
And Paula Kelly, 
Will Supply Rhythm
Carnegies Class of 41 have 
spared themselves no effort in 
their desire to give the campus an 
outstanding Junior Prom this year. 
Feeling that the prom should rank 
with other top affairs, the commit
tee in charge obtained the services 
of A1 Donohue arid his Orchestra. 
This band was recently named as 
the Band of the Month.
Featured in a series of nation
wide hookups, A1 Donohue can be 
heard eleven times between now 
and the prom. He will bring with 
him his lovel singer Paula Kelly 
whose face is already familiar to 
the campus from the many posters 
which have appeared bearing her 
picture.
The crowning of the Snow 
Queen will take place shortly be
fore intermission. Although vot
ing for the seven candidates took 
place today, the Queen wijl re
main unkniwn until the time of 
the coronation. The Class of 41 
hopes that the* election of Snow 
Queen from-the Junior Class will 
become an annual custom.
Although the actual plans have 
not been divulged, it is known that 
a great deal of effort has gone into 
taking full advantage of the 
Snow theme and all the decora
tions and activities will bear this 
atmosphere.
The Prom will be held in the 
Schenley Hotel Ballroom on Februar 9. Dancing will last from 9- 
1 oclock. The price is $3.50 per 
couple.
Board Elected 
By Citcom Clan
At a meeting held Friday, Feb
ruary 2, members were elected 
for the executive board of the 
Citcom Clan for the coming year.
The new members of the board 
are Anthony L. Pranses, 42, Rob
ert H. McBride, 42, Robert A. 
Buchanan, 41, E. Edwin Bankson, 31, William D. Jamison, 41, 
Richard L. McLaughlin, 43, and 
J. Lester Cullen, 41.
K. Ro Burchard 
Joins Printing 
Dept. Faculty
Mr. Kenneth R. Burchard has 
been chosen to fill the position of 
instructor in presswork and 
photo-lithography vacated by Mr. 
William E. Day, who has return
ed to full-time practice of law in 
his Washington, D. C., offices.
Mr. Burchard graduated from 
William Jewell College and work
ed at the college press for a short 
time afterwaid. Under his direc
tion the printing department at 
Central High School in' Muskogee, 
Oklahoma, was transformed from 
a single basement room containing 
a little obsolete equipment.
He took up photography as a 
hobby about three years ago and 
since that time his photographic 
projection prints have been dis
played in several of the nations 
leading salon exhibitions.
Athletic Card 
Needed in Poll 
Held Tomorrow
Election of Snow Queen, and a 
vote on student interest in the 
Scotch and Soda revue, will take 
place tomorrow from 12:20 to 1:30, 
at the four regular polls. In or
der to vote a student must pre
sent his athletic card.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 in 
Arts 106, the Scotch and Soda 
Club will meet to discuss the re
sults of the election. If the re
sults are favorable, plans for the 
annual show will be continued.
The Snow Queen will be chosen 
from among one of the following 
juniors: Marie Davis, Gamma Phi 
Sigma; Theresa Dumont, Alpha 
Theta Sigma; Zera Ferrari, Gam
ma Gamma Gamma; Patty I-Iaislip, 
Beta Tau Lambda; Polly Jensen, 
Beta Pi; Miriam Kahn, Alpha 
Kappa Psl; Eva Rasch, Kappa Phi 
Delta. Each sorority on campus 
elected a junior member to com
pete for this honor, and the con
testants have been chosen from 
this group. The final choice of 
the queen is up to the student 
body.
Friday evening at the Junior 
Prom the Snow Queen will be an
nounced and crowned. The idea 
of a Snow Queen is new to the 
Carnegie campus.
On February 1 at the tea dajicc 
given by Delta Skull in Thistle 
Hall the candidates for Snow 
Queen were presented publicly. 
Pictures of the candidates were 
printed in the rotagravure section 
of a prominent New York paper.

This dialogue took place Sunday

But Lebovit was home in bed at

Social Workers 
Add Law Course
Law for Social Workers, a new 
course at Carnegie, will be given 
for the first time during this se

ment of economics, the course 
will include cases and lectures on 
legal problems encountered by 
social workers.
The course^ open to qualified 
workers in the Pittsburgh area, is 
a part of the graduate curriculum 
of the Department of Social Work 
at Carnegie. Classes will meet 
every Saturday from 8:30-10:30 
A. M.
A great deal of reference work 
to be done in the Allegheny Coun

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1940
Tartan Will Publish Twice 
Weekly Next Semester
With this issued the TARTAN Inters the field of semiweekly collegiate journalism.
The staff hopes that the new TARTAN will reflect in in
creased interest and usefulness the added work that is necessary 
to produce it. This not in a spirit of martyrdom, but rather in 
an attempt to show that its prim desire is to find the means 
whereby it can best serve the campus.
The personnel of the TARTAN is not hand selected. The 
staff is made up of students who represent' almost all groups 
and activities on campus. In doubling the frequency of publi
cation the staff is also redoubling its attempts to cover the 
campus completely and fairly. In publishing twice each week 
the staff is able to write a more timely sheet.
The story does not end here, for despite its most earnest 
efforts one job remains that the staff cannot handle alone.
The TARTAN now depends more than ever on the support 
of its advertisers. Surveys have shown that our campus is a 
powerful buying unit. Our advertisers know this, but our prob
lem is to convey this information to potential advertisers, and 
this can be done only by individual students mentioning their 
collegiate affiliationsif at all possiblewhen making a pur
chase. In no more forcible way can we show our strength. In 
this part of the TARTAN-the campusprogram, all students 
play an important part.
It is with pleasure and enthusiasm that the staff says for the 
"first time in the history of the paper-----until Friday.
Campus Votes Tomorrow 
For Revue, Sorority Queen
Tomorrow the campus votes, for the third successive year 
on whether or not it wants the Scotch and Soda annual revue 
as a part of the Spring Carnival program. The answer 
obvious: the campus has shown that it enjoys and does want 
the show. It is foolish to repeat this poll each year.
If there is any activity on the campus, that justifies its ex
istence, that activity is the Scotch and Soda Club. The shows 
put on by the club are the only original, all-student, co-ed mu
sical revues given by any college in the country. There are 
very few campuses that can boast student talent capable of 
writing original and professional script, music, lyrics; capable 
of handling all phases of directing and acting with no outside 
or faculty help; capable of designing and building its own 
scenery, lighting, and props. Scotch and Sodas Spring Car
nival Revue is something peculiarly Carnegie, and peculiarly 
cosmopolitan for Carnegie.
At the same time that the students vote on Scotch and Soda 
popularity they will be selecting a junior sorority girl to be 
crowned Snow Queen at the Junior Prom. We heard re
monstrances to the effect that all junior girls are not given an 
opportune to be selected, as would be the case if the, choice 
were not restricted to girls who belong to * sororities.
This reminds us of a story that took place last year. One 
of the big boys on campus called the representative of a 
sorority and told her that her sororitys Greek Sing and Swing 
application was past due. He added that if the votes of her sor
ority in the forthcoming election were placed right this would 
be overlooked, but if not they would not be allowed to compete.
The Snow Queen election is more wheedling than threaten
ing. Membership in the Delta Skull honorary (the group 
that runs the Junior Prom) is monopolized by eight fraternities, 
with 15 of its 19 members belonging to the 5 fraternities that 
show the most active interest in Student Council positions. This 
explains why the Snow Queen must belong to an organiza
tiona sorority.
Once in a dorm bull session on campus politics someone 
naively asked: But how can the same fraternities manage to 
control Student Council year after year? The anecdote above 
furnishes part of the explanation, and it shows the beginning of 
the election sweep of 1940 for the same fraternities. And what 
does Scotch-and Soda have to do with all this? Answer: they

Yall remembuh Daisy Mae, 
doncha? Do you know that shes 
the fifth of her family to come to 
Tech . . . oh, pardon us, were 
talking about the city Daisy Mae 
. Aida Squiteri, also known as 
Squit.
Daisy Mae, Aida, or Squit . . . 
shes President of the Senior Class
AIDA SQUITIERI
of Margaret Morrison, Senior Rep
resentative of Womens Guild and 
a member of Student Council.
Shes 100% for Tech . . . likes 
the people here, likes its football,
its activities . . . everything. Her 
father, who .is an Assistant Pro
fessor in Sculpture, started the 
family tradition of coming to 
Tech, which has been followed by 
six of the eight Squitieris, includ
ing a sister, Norma, who is a soph
omore in Margaret Morrison;
One day last year Squit was in 
the Grill harmonizing with a few 
of the boys when a Scotch and 
Soda scout said, Youre not too 
corny, why not try out for the 
show? So they ended up in the 
Scotch and Soda Club production, 
and sang with Dick Stabile, too. 
She loves to sing, does it at home, 
at school, in the locker room, on 
the street, any place.
In fact, she likes any kind of 
music . . . and guess what is her 
favorite opera . . . youre right 
. . .its Aida.
As a student in General Studies, 
majoring in languages, particular
ly Spanish and Italian, she speaks 
from experience when she says 
that her pet hate is 8:30s.
Besides being an enthusiastic 
rooter at all football games, Squit 
is active in athletics herself. Last 
year she had one of the ten high
est scores on the bowling team, 
and in addition played on the 
basketball team.
She can usually be found in or 
around Slcibo, where her spare 
time' is spent eating cocoanut 
cream pie and butter pecan ice
From the Eastern New Mexico 
College we hear that conditions 
are so bad that half the student 
body has to study on the steps, on 
the grass, in the waiting busses, 
or in the halls of their one lone 
class-room buildingand some of 
us kick about a mere tuition raise.
Interhonorary fraternity coun
cil is trying hard to get on its 
feet; it even has a constitution 
written and almost ready for ap
proval. The only hitch is that 
the effort is not coming from the 
honoraries so much as from one 
Prof. Lawler. Every new . idea 
has to have a leader of some sort, 
but it also has to have followers. 
So unless some of the honoraries 
show more interest, wed say an
other good idea is going to pot. 
One effect of the group has al
ready been shown, though, in the 
reduction of cribbing on finals. 
Much to the discomfort of certain 
individuals, we might add.
Student Councils investiga
tion of appropriations is in many 
ways a stroke of genius. If all 
the information that is carried 
around in the heads of certain 
persons were laid on the table, 
aiorig with the figures in the ac
count books, it would be very re
vealing. That would be a big 
order even for the Dies Commit
tee. On the other hand, if the ef
fect of the investigation is to 
cut some appropriations, but to 
overlook those of certain proi tected organizations, for years
cant lose, or can you?
Dr. S. Winston Cram of Emporia 
State Teachers College urges all in 
his classes not to cram for his final 
examinations. Cram says that his 
students are encouraged to use 
crib notes when they write their 
answers to his quiz problems. 
We have no Crams at Tech but we 
have students who use his meth

Propaganda Is Old Stufi
Even the Old Pharoalis Lied 
About Their Victories, Losses
By Gilbert Kivenson
Modern propaganda in the form | 
of censored news releases and un
truthful war communiques has 
been a source of great interest to 
the average American.
Two warring nations will re
port victories in the same battle. 
They will deny losses. The citi
zens who supply the armies know 
little of the reverses met in the 
field by their soldiers. The cer
tainty of victory keeps the fight 
going until the very end. How 
wonderful is modern propaganda!
These tactics, however, are al
most as old as civilization itself. 
Archaeologists have discovered 
that some of the most modern 
methods were used in ancient 
Egypt. In 1300 B. C., for exam
ple, Pharaoh Ramses II led an 
army against the Hittites and their 
allies at Kadish. According to the 
best records Ramses fought a los
ing battle, but was able to retreat 
in good order. Upon his return 
to Thebes he spread the news of 
a tremendous Victory of Kadish 
over walls a quarter of a mile 
wide, and thus retained the rev
erence of the people.
A century later Ramses III 
tried the same ruse with even 
greater success. The third 
Ramses had not even encountered 
the Hittites on his expedition and 
had reported a wonderful victory!
Thus it can be seen that propa
ganda is not modern. It has been 
used through the ages by an in
tellectually powerful few to in
fluence and subordinate the non
thinking many.

Early in your undergraduate 
years it is wise to discuss plans 
for your future work with your 
placement officer. In many cases 
the college placement bureau can 
arrange interviews for. the  stu
dent' with personnel managers in 
various organizations.
Decide about your future career, 
then find a prospective employer. 
In order to do this you may refer 
to agencies, ads, or have direct 
contact. Some sources of informa
tion are Bankers Economic Serv
ice; Poors Register of Directors; 
Dun and Bradstreets; Kellys Di
rectory of Merchants, Manufactur

publications, such as Census of 
Manufacturers and the Depart

Be ready to prepare yourself 
actively for your first sales in
terview. Learn as much as you 
think you need to know about the 
first concern to which you are to 
apply for employment.

Fenn Team Seeks 
Revenge in Game 
With Tech Tonight
Techs puck-chnscrs eked out a 
victory in a hard fought game 
against Fenn this week. Fenn 
gained a two point lead in the 
earlier part of the game, but Tech 
came back to clinch the game with 
three goals. There were several 
improvements noted in Techs 
play with Feiler and Wilson play
ing heads-up hockey. Techs backchecking was still weak.
The Skibos have won two 
games this season while losing 
three. In the Pennsylvania-Ohio 
Intercollegiate league, Tech is in 
third place behind John Carroll 
and Duquesne. Wilson is the 
high scorer of the team with four 
goals and one assist with Schilawske second with two goals and two 
assists to his credit.
Burleigh, last years captain, 
played a fast game at cen
ter Tuesday night making one 
assist. It was his first game of 
the season. It is also hoped that 
Culver will return to the line
up as the Plaids are very weak in 
reserve strength. The Tartans 
play Fenn at the Garden again 
tonight.
STARK SCORES FOR TECHRisedorphs

By Temple

Leading Scorers 
For Plaid. Cause
Boasting of one of the finest 
teams ever to don the red "T oC 
Temple, the Tcmpleites sunk the 
Skibo mermen in a meet held last 
Saturday in the Carnegie pool. 
When all the water had settled 
back in the pool, the score stood at 
45 to 30 with the red Owls sing
ing the songs of victory.
Sparked by a trio of sophomore 
splashers the men from Philly 
were able to take an early lead, 
and were successful in holding 
this margin until the end of the 
meet. From all reports these three 
second year men have broken 
many a record in eastern pools, 
for each of them hold record 
marks made during the Middle 
Atlantic A. A. U. championship 
races.
For the Tartan cause, Bill Mol
vie was the outstanding perform
er, Sir Will walked off with first 
honors in the 50 yard free-style 
sprint event setting the good time 
of 25.2. Harold Hirsch did his bit 
for the Alma Mater by clipping 
oil the neat time of 5:50.2 to take 
first place in the 440 yard distance 
race.
Coach Risedorphs swimmers 
next perform tomorrow aftdrnoon 
when they meet the mermen from 
W&J. This meet scheduled to 
commence at 4:30 should prove 
to be a thriller, for the Prexys 
are said to have assembled a 
swimming team of no ill fame.
SKIBO SPORTS

HOCKEY TEAM NEEDS SUPPORT
 By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor -  .......
When Pitt discontinued hockey at the beginning of this 
year, it looked very much like the Tartans would have to do the 
same thing. But those directly interested in the sport refused to 
see it abandoned. Consequently, Carnegies team is now playing 
in the OhioPennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey League. And 
we might add that the boys are doing all right by themselves.
However, student interest to date has been practically nil. 
If attendance can be taken as an indication, most of the students 
must not know that we have a team. This is particularly sur
prising in view of the fact that the admission to the games is 
only twenty-five cents, one-fourth of a dollar, and that this ad
mission includes skating after the game if one 'wishes.
To say that the students should support the team is almost 
a superfluous statement. Especially, when one considers that 
these boys get up at five oclock in the morning to practice, 
-which should rate them some kind of distinguished service 
medal at least.
Although the team to date does not have a very impressive 
record, we are assured that this matter will receive immediate 
attention with the return of a couple of last years players 
which should give the team some much needed manpower. So, 
we urge you to come out to see the skaters in action. Even if 
they dont win, youll like their new uniforms. Y
Tickets may be purchased at the Athletic Office.
Dr. Bakers Appointment Pleases One And All
The appointment of Dr. Eddie Baker to the head coaching 
position in football came as a surprise to practically no one, 
just as it pleased one and all. Significant' of the selection of 
the good doctor is the unanimous approval of the footballers 
themselves. This fact alone points to better things next year 
than this past tragic season.
Those who have charge of such appointments should be con
gratulated on their action in selecting the former Pitt star over 
a host of other applicants.
Dr. Baker accepted the job knowing well the problems he 
must face. Already the scholarship axe has cut no less than 
five varsity gridders from those who are eligible for spring prac
tice. However, with , such capable assistants as Joe Skladany 
and Bill Glassford, Dr. Baker will give Carnegie Tech a fighting 
football team next year.

TECH SCORING ACE (35) SINKS ANOTHER BASKET
Duke Five Wins, 43-35 
As 3,000 Cram Gym
Stark Leads Scoring * 
For Tartan Quintet
Duquesnes Hilltopper five took 
the measure of the Plaid basket
ball team last Saturday night by 
a score of 43 to 35. The game was 
played before the biggest crowd 
that the Tech gym has had this 
year, approximately 3,300 persons.
The Skibo fans were highly en
lightened by the return to action 
of Red Burch and the addition of 
footballer Ted Fischer. Captain 
Rube Stark led all men on the 
floor in scoring, piling up 18 
points, 14* from field goals. Be
hind him camd two Dukes, Millcovich and Widowitz with 13 and 
12 points respectively.
The victory was the tenth for 
the Dukes out of 12 battles, while 
it proved the seventh defeat for 
the Hannum-men in the last 10 
starts. Duquesne started off 
strong, but the Plaid managed to 
hang on to their opponents and 
hold them to a 21 to 1G score at 
the end of the first half. The 
Tech man-to-man defense seemed 
to bottle up the Hilltoppers in the 
first half, but the long shots of 
Paul Widowitz sent the ball flying 
cleanly through the hoop.
After the half-time rest the 
Plaid looked a bit tired, and the 
ability of the Red and Blue to suc
cessfully freeze the ball in the 
last half held the home team at 
bay, and the Dukes flipped in 22 
points to the Skibos 19. The game 
ended with a score of 43 to 35 in 
favor of the visitors, but the 
Plaid still has a chance to redeem 
themselves in the return match 
later in the season.
Just before exams, Pitt, led by 
Eddie Stralowskis 32 points beat 
the Plaid in the Stadium by a 
73 to 42 margin.
Baker is New 
Football Coach
Skladany, Glassford 
Appointed As Aides
The Tech Tartans football des
tinies have finally been settled 
for the 1940 season with the ap
pointment of Dr. Eddie Baker as 
head coach of the Skibo forces. 
His assistant will be another hold
over from the Kern regime, Joe 
Muggsy Skladany.
The weekend brought forth the 
name of next years line coach, a 
former Pitt All-American guard 
from 1936, Bill Glassford who 
captained the Panthers in their 
Rose Bowl encounter with Wash
ington on New Years Day in 
1937. A baekfield coach has still 
to be selected and there is a possi
bility that the name of Merlyji 
Condit may be next to that job 
when next fall runs around.
Table Tennis 
Deadline Set 
At February II
February 11 has been set as the 
deadline for all table tennis 
matches to be played and report
ed. Many teams have neglected 
to sumbit scores of games played 
immediately after their matches 
are completed. Ail matches un
reported by the eleventh will be 
automatically recorded as a loss 
for both teams.
All future games must be play
ed in the alloted time and the re
sults reported by 5 oclock on the 
last day of the period. Failure to 
comply with this regulation will 
also result in a defeat being re
corded.
The standings at the present 
time show Scobell Hall and Citcom Clan leading the parade in 
the Independent League, both 
sporting clean slates. In the Fra
ternity Circuit the undefeated 
leaders are the Kappa Sigs, Tau 
Dolts, and Beta Sigs.________________

Dance to Feature 
Music by LeRoy
Bill LeRoy and his band will 
supply the music for the Valen
tine Dance of the Vocationals 
still Industries to the majority of 
the studentsin Thistle Hall next 
Saturday.
This dance, bearing a romantic 
theme, has always proved one of 
the most popular on the evening 
school card. Decorations are 
usually attractive and this year 
will be no exception. Hearts, 
bows-and-darts, lace-and-ribbon 
valentines will decorate the walls 
with Dangerous Dan Cupid prom' 
inent among them. The effect 
will be enhanced by the use of 
red and white streamers, the 
crystal ball doing its parts to cre
ate a Mardi Gras atmosphere. The 
illusion of old-time valentines 
will probably be heightened by 
the appearance of the dancers, as 
the young ladies are being en
couraged to again wear their full 
length dresses and the picture 
made by sweet young faces and 
smiling eyes will be completed 
by long, rustly frocks of bright 
colors.
Much forethought went into the 
planning of this event, the or
chestra having been engaged early 
in the fall to insure good music for 
the evening. Bill LeRoy. is no 
stranger tothe campus and re
quests from those who have pre
viously danced to his music were 
the main reason for his being con
tacted for this dance.
Fi'esh flower corsages will be 
given to the first two hundred 
girls to arrive. Industries regis
tration cards will be used for ad
mittanceor the usual fee of one 
dollar a couple.
Pen Points
-Ed NussGirls Invited 
To Wear Formal 
Gowns To Dance
Evening Student Council officers 
plan a campaign for dressy 
dances of the type for which the 
evening campus has been known 
for many years, but which have 
died out more or less recently. 
The gay and sweet formality for 
which the old South is famous al
ways prevailed at the evening 
school dances in Thistle Hall but 
with the advent of the jitterbug 
afid swingtime, picturesque gowns 
have become notable by their ab
sence.
The initial step in this cam
paign comes as a form of request 
from the Industries officers that 
all young ladies wear long dresses 
to the Valentine Dance next Sat
urday if they can conveniently do 
so. This does not mean that 
street dresses are out of place, but 
it is hoped that the fact that In
dustries are advertising their 
dance as semi-formal will serve 
as a hint to the fair sex that floorlength dresses will be in very good 
taste if they desire to wear them.

One of the most outstanding 
characteristics of the greater 
American public is their unfail
ing sympathy for the under
dog. No matter what the fight 
may be, boxing, baseball, foot
ball or any other sport, you will 
find most of the sentiment in favor 
of the little fellow.
It is easy for anyone who is 
familiar with the past history of 
this great nation of ours to under
stand this feeling. We were def
initely the underdogs when we 
won our freedom in 76 and 
again when we resisted the su
perior forces of the English in 
1812. Then came the long up
hill battle against nature herself 
as we carved this nation from the 
wilderness it was. In every case 
the odds were against us, yet 
we always emerged victorious.
Perhaps that is why we are so 
susceptible to the crys from across 
the seas, and why we are such 
easy victims to the propaganda 
spreader who plays upon our 
sympathies, by placing before us 
the sorry plight of some small na
tion battling for her freedom. Per
haps that is why we sent so many 
of our finest away in 1917 and 
1918 to save the world for de
mocracy even if they died doing 
it.. Perhaps that gM why there is 
so much talk now of our taking 
part in another major conflict.
It is very noble and generous 
for us to aid the downtrodden and 
as long as we do it in a sensible 
way we will be finer people be
cause of it, but if we lose control 
of it, this sense of duty may be
come the tragedy of this country.
Treasurer
Student Council
Evening Student Council con
vened in the new Carnegie Union 
on Sunday, January 7, 1940, at 
2:30 P. M. Minutes of December 
3rd meeting were read and ap
proved.
President Marcinizyn reported 
that two, new stands were placed 
in Industries Hall for the dis
tribution of the Tartan, and ask
ed that members of Council check 
on the number of papers taken 
from the stands in order that a 
more even distribution can be ef
fected in the various locations.
Nothing has been heard to date 
from the Administration regard
ing late lights in the College of 
Fine Arts. The Committee will 
again approach Dr. Warden on 
the subject.
President Marcinizyn related to 
Council the finding of the ineligi
bility of Mr. Klemp to hold office 
on Evening Student Council due 
to the fact that Mr. Klemp did 
not have the necessary class at
tendance hours. Mr. Klemp ten
dered his resignation to Coun
cil in a letter dated December 10, 
1939, which was accepted after a 
complete discussion of the rules 
of eligibility.
Following the rules, the remain
ing officers of the College of In
dustries recommended the name 
of Russell Stroschein to fill the 
vacancy created by the resignation 
of Mr. Klemp. A vote by ballot 
was taken and Mr. Stroschein 
was approved as the new Presi
dent of Industries.
The names of the Social Com
mittees of the Colleges of Engi
neering and Fine Arts were read 
and approved. Ronald Shoff and 
Robert Metcalf are Chairmen re
spectively of Engineering and Fine 
Arts.

JAMES C. FISHER * *
Fislier Elected 
As Treasurer
Council Honors 
Former President
Students in the Evening Engi
neering College chose as their 
treasurer at the election in the 
autumn James C. Fisher of New 
Kensington, Pa. This is Jims 
third year in the Council, his first 
election being in 1937-38. At the 
end of that year he was elected 
President of the 1938-39 Council, 
in which capacity he had unsur
passed success. His tolerance and 
ability to value the other fellows 
viewpoint were undoubtedly con
tributing factors in this success.
Last June Jim received his cer
tificate in electrical engineering 
and came right back in Septem
ber, headed toward that coveted 
degree.
Although he is well-liked by 
everyone with whom he comes 
into contact, Jim appears uncon
scious of it and continues in his 
placed path, doing the best job 
that is possible, no matter what 
task is assigned. Pie gives only 
his honest opinionif one is asked 
but does it in such a way that 
he gains goodwill everywhere. He 
speaks without haste and never 
criticizes unnecessarily.
He has unbounded faith in Car
negie Tech, knowing it to be 
ultra - ultra in engineering 
schools. Some of this belief may 
be caused by the fact that his 
father received his degree from 
the school in 1912most of it 
comes from his inherent charac
teristic of giving credit where 
credit is due.
Jim is striding right along in 
his work in the Engineering De
partment of the Aluminum Com
pany of America where he has 
been employed for three years, 
and finds that his vocation and 
school work go hand in hand. 
Equal enthusiasm is given his 
leisure hours and he misses noth
ing of interestlate movies, all 
dances and plays, not only at Tech 
but in his home-town as well.
Students Pay 
Activities Fee 
Once a Year
Included As Part 
Of General Fee 
In First Semester
Because of the manner in which 
the information on fees has been 
written and published in the cata
logue, and the omission of the ac
tivity fee information from the 
registration permit and registra
tion card, many students are in 
doubt, particularly as to the 
amount of activity fee paid. Some 
students have questioned Coun
cil as to whether the general fee 
was a greatly enlarged student 
activities fee.
Since the Evening Student 
Council started in 1925, the stu
dent activities fee has always been 
$1.00, which is paid at the first 
registration. This year the fee 
was included in the general fee 
which totaled $7.00 for under
graduate engineering students and 
$4.00 for other undergraduatestu
dents. This means that the gen
eral fee is in reality. $6.00 and 
$3.00, respectively; this amount 
going directly to the Institute.
The $1.00 per year activity fee, 
paid by undergraduate students, 
was voted into effect by the Stu
dent Body when Council was 
given its Constitution and helps 
to finance the social program ar
ranged by Council. This fee en
titles the student to participate in 
the social activities, receive the 
Carnegie Tartan, the hand-book, 
and attend functions held' by the 
college in which he is registered.

has passed, time yet remains for 
interested students to earn Even
ing Student Council activities 
keys.
Points toward the awards may 
be earned in several ways. Many 
of the activities which offer key 
credits also furnish an excellent 
means of becoming acquainted 
with other students and enjoying 
the comradeship which should be 
a part of every college education.
Social functions, sponsored by 
Evening Student Council and the 
various colleges, present opportu
nities for a wide assortment of ac
tivities. Before each affair signs 
and posters are needed and points 
are awarded for making them. 
Other students can earn points by 
decorating Thistle Hall or the 
Gym. While the affair is in prog
ress, there must be attendants in 
the check-room, and they are also 
rewarded with key credits. The 
clean-up periods, which are on 
Sunday afternoons in the case of 
Saturday evening affairs, also of
fer opportunities for earning the 
award. For the creative student, 
there are the Friday evening 
meetings of the Plaid staff.
Students interested in securing 
further information about activi
ties should commui^icate with 
Evening Student Council.

It is a commonly accepted fact 
that people do not appreciate any
thing until it has been taken away 
from them.
The officials at Tech have gone 
to the expense of providing facili
ties for swimming for men only, 
on Thursday and Friday nights, 
from 7 to 11 oclock. To d.ate, 
however, the turnouts have been 
so small that they are considering 
eliminating this privilege.
The mixed swim on Wednesday 
has proved very popular. Per
haps the boys only want to swim 
to show off their brawny muscles 
in front of the bright-eyed lassies.
Be that as it may, the problem 
has been left solely up to the stu
dents themselves. If they wish to 
retain this privilege, they will 
have to prove it by coming out 
regularly.
Here is an opportunity to par
ticipate in one o the greatest 
sports we have, and keep in con
dition during the' winter months.
