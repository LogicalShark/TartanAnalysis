Take Her, 
Shes Mine 
At Playhouse
The Pittsburgh Playhouse an
nounced today it will open the 
new theater season Saturday, 
October 5 with a production of 
the Broadway hit comedy, Take 
Her, Shes Mine. The very re
cent hit, which starred Art Car
ney on Broadway, will play in 
the Hamlet Street Theater at the 
f{|* Playhouse. In November, the 
Craft Avenue Theater will be 
opened for the season with a 
production of West Side Story. 
Reservations for both productions 
will be available after Labor Day.
The > scheduling of Take Her, 
Shes Mine represents a real 
coup for the Pittsburgh Play
house. Until ten day ago, the 
George Abbott produced comedy 
was not available to theaters
4 around the United States. The 
Pittsburgh Playhouse is the first 
theater to secure production rights 
for the show.
Casting for both Take Her, 
Shes Mine, and West Side 
Story did not begin until af
ter Labor Day. Rehearsals for 
Take Her - Shes Mine began 
the first week in September.
To compliment the arrival of 
Take Her, Shes Mine, OctoM ber 5 and West Side Story in 
November, the Pittsburgh Play
house Association is almost com
pletely renovating the physical 
facilities of the Playhouse. Ex
terior and interior re-decorating 
is now in progress, new side
walks have been installed, and a 
new light board has been de
signed for the Hamlet Street The
ater. The renovation has been 
made possible through the generosity of Mrs. Alan M. Scaife 
who donated $75,000 for the 
project.
Film Arts 
Opens 63-64 
Session
# MAKE MINE MINK is a fun
ny film. A very funny film. It is 
the delightful story of a group 
of respectable citizens who give 
freely to non-profit organizations 
by stealing freely from profitable 
ones, and stealing in such a hilar
ious manner that the film was 
held over for weeks in every lo
cation which it played. MAKE 
MINE MINK is the opening film 
of the new Fall Season of the 
~ Film Arts Society.
For the past twelve years, 
Film Arts has been presenting 
to its subscribers the worlds

twenty-eight cinema masterpieces 
will be added to the list of over 
two hundred and fifty film clas

340 Freshmen Whiz 
Thru Camp Activities
Freshman Camp for the class of 1967 began about six months 
ago when the first planning meetings were held for the future camp 
staff. With the announcements of counselors in May, and the first 
general staff meetings Freshman Camp began to take form. All 
the planning and arrangements were realized last week at 3 p.m. on 
Thursday when 340 excited*
Freshmen poured out of the buses 
and were met by sixty anxious 
and equally excited staff mem
bers. The first afternoons activi
ties consisted of hectic volleyball, 
football, basketball, and badmin
ton games, including spectacular 
performances by faculty members 
such as Dr. Perlis, who showed 
the freshmen that it is difficult to 
determine between a gym teacher 
and a mathematics department 
head!
The class of 67 had its first for
mal introduction to Tech faculty 
that night as Dr. Coleman deliv
ered the Keynote Address. This 
was followed by square dancing 
on the volleyball courts and danc
ing to some wild sounds provided 
by WRCT. The first night away
from home for the Frosh proved 
to be an early one with eleven 
oclock curfew!
Everyone woke up bright and 
early Wednesday morning to the 
pleasant sounds of Gary Lindstroms Bagpipes and Larry 
Soulaks comments warning us 
that it was good grub time, 
which meant that if the frosh did 
not get the counselors out of bed 
pretty quickly they would all miss 
breakfast. The morning program 
turned out to be a little frighten
ing to some of the freshmen, as 
two simulated press conferences 
were held with the class as the 
audience. Ian Raffel and Ben Por
ter each gave addresses announc
ing that Tech planned to switch

all courses to five years instead of 
four. This was followed by a few 
questions from the floor, and then 
discussion groups of about fifteen 
people each scattered around 
camp to talk about the idea of a 
five-year education. Hopefully, 
many of these discussions gravi
tated to the subject of exactly 
what one should expect out of a 
college education . . . many new 
ideas were presented and argued 
over.
After more swimming, football 
(Perlis starred again), volleyball 
(featuring frosh versus counselors
. . . score unavailable since thi* 
author was on the counselor 
team!), badminton, and general 
confusion, it was again time for 
some good grub.
After lunch the frosh again split 
into two large groups and this 
time heard seven counselors give 
their credos of life. Representa

Sororities, Fraternities 
Improve Over-All Factors, 
Rate Scholarship High
Both the all-fraternity and the 
all-sorority averages increased 
significantly over those of last fall. 
The former went up 0.110, and the 
latter 0.060. These may seem 
slight until one realizes the large 
number of people who must raise 
their own averages to cause the 
overall average to increase. Ac
tually, sixteen of the nineteen 
fraternities and sororities in
creased their cumulative factors.
For the Spring Semester, 1963, 
Sigma Nu led the fraternities, and 
Alpha Epsilon Phi led the sorori
ties. The competition is severe on 
this campus because of the high 
academic requirements of the 
school. It is always a source of 
great pride for a house to be able 
to win the scholarship trophy for 
a semester.
One of the most important com
petitions on Techs campus is that 
held among the twelve fraterny 
ties and seven sororities in quest 
of the scholarship trophies. Both 
the Council of Fraternity Presi
dents and Pan Hellenic Council I 
award these cups to the frater| 
nity and the sorority which accu-| 
mulate the highest quality point j 
average for the previous semester.
All of the Greeks will be work
ing harder this semester to raise! 
their averages even higher in the^ 
hope of winning the coveted 
trophy. I
The academic averages of the 
Greek Organizations for the 
spring semester, 1963, are a 
follows:

Cambridge University, the College has now finished its 
third year, with Sir Winston 
Churchill as Chairman of the 
Board.
The amount of the grant in 
each case will be $3000 for nine 
months of study for a single 
man, or $4000 for a married man.
Five hundred dollars will be 
added for each dependent child.
An applicant must be a male 
citizen of the U.S.A. On Sep
tember 1, 1964, he must have had 
five years of residence in this 
country, be at least 19 years of 
age and less than 26, and must 
hold a bachelors degree from a 
recognized American college.
Selection of Churchill Scholars 
will be made on the basis of: in
tellectual ability and promise and 
achievement, interest and apti
tude in science, character, per
sonality and leadership.
Application is limited to men

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH, 
DEAR FRIENDS
Today I begin my tenth year of writing this column in your 
campus newspaper. Ten years is a long time; it is, in fact, what 
some scholarly people like to call a decadefrom the Latin 
word deccum, meaning the floor of a ship. It is, to my mind, 
remarkable that the Romans had such a word as deccum when 
you consider that ships did not exist until 1620 when John 
Alden invented the Mayflower. Alden, a prodigiously ingenious 
man, also invented the ear lobe and Pocahontas.
Ships were a very popular mode of travelespecially over 
wateruntil 1912 when the Swede, Ivar Krueger, invented the 
iceberg. Krueger also invented the match, which is a good 
thing, because without the match, how would you light your 
Marlboro Cigarettes? I cannot overstress the importance of 
lighting your Marlboro Cigarettes, for Marlboro Cigarettes, 
unlighted, provide, at best, only limited smoking pleasure.
RE CODO WC K!SI NGL1ICG07T AUFOLWIO
I mention Marlboros because this column is an advertise
ment, brought to you through the school year by the makers 
of Marlboros. Marlboros come in soft pack or Flip-Top box. 
The makers of Marlboros come in dark suits with thin lapels 
except on weekends when they come in yoke-neck jerseys 
and white duck trousers. White ducks come in flocks. They are 
primarily fresh water dwellers, although they have been suc
cessfully raised in salt water too. Another salt water denizen 
Im sure you will find enjoyable is planktona mess of tiny 
organisms like diatoms and algae and like that which float 
sluggishly near the surface of the sea. It is ironic that these 
creatures, microscopic in size, should supply the principal 
source of food for the earth's largest animal, the whale. Whales, 
I must say, are not at all pleased with this arrangement, be
cause it takes the average whale, eating steadily, 48 hours to 
gather a days meal. This leaves them almost no time for 
water sports or reading Melville. It is a lucky thing -for all of 
us that whales are unaware they are mammals, not fish, and 
could, if they tried, live just as well on land as in water. I 
mean, you add ten or twelve million whales to our Sunday 
traffic and you would have congestion that makes the mind 
boggle.
But I digress. Today, I was saying, I begin my tenth year of 
writing this column for Marlboro Cigarettes in your campus 
newspaper. I will, in each column, say a few kind words about 
Marlborosjust as you will, once you try that fine tobacco 
flavor, that pristine white filter, that supple soft pack, that 
infrangible Flip-Top box. These references to Marlboro will be 
brief and unobtrusive, for I do not believe in the hard sell. 
What I favor is the soft sellyou might even call it the limp 
or spongy sell. I hasten to state that the makers of Marlboro 
in ten full years have not once complained about my desultory 
sales approach. Neither have they paid me.
But that is of small consequence. Aside from fleeting mention* 
of Marlboro, this column has another, and more urgent, mission: 
to cast the hot white light of free inquiry upon the vexing 
questions that trouble college Americaquestions like Should 
the Student Council have the power to levy tariffs? and Are 
roommates sanitary? and Should housemothers be com
pelled to retire upon reaching the age of 26?'!
Perhaps, reasoning together, we can find the answers. Per
haps not. But if we fail, let it never be said that jt was for 
want of trying.
I thank you.
* *  1003 Max SbuJmaa
INC toneSIANO CTt I. N
The makers of Marlboro are happy to bring you another 
year of Max Shulmans unpredictable and uncensored col
umnand also happy to bring you fine filtered Marlboros, 
acailable in pack or box, wherever cigarettes are sold in aU M states.

Winning the Race But 
Losing the Trophy
Near the end of the past school year, a 
comment by Dr. Warner headlined on the 
f front page of a Pittsburgh paper. President 
Warner was quoted as calling the United 
States space effort naive and dangerous. Two 
days later, Post-Gazette cartoonist Hungerford pictured a bewildered Uncle Sam clad 
in a space suit being kicked by a vociferous 
Dr. Warner. Those who were quick to con
demn Dr. Warners remarks need to realize 
that our race with the Russians in space 
achievements may not be the most important 
scientific development. Our fear of Russian 
 superiority has clouded the important ad
vancements in technological areas achieved 
by Western Europe, which now proves to be 
a threat to our economy.
The Russians excel in only a few areas 
of science. They cannot compare with our 
discoveries in high-energy nuclear physics, 
our research in semiconductors and maserlaser studies and our progress in plastics, 
petrochemicals, radioactive isotopes, as well 
as in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, 
0 and molecular biology. Russian competition 
in technological and scientific items can in 
no way match that of Great Britain, Japan, 
and Western Europe.
Some of our large airlines have ordered 
many British-made short range jet planes 
and the supersonic jets. Delivery date as well 
as price were considered in choosing a for
eign over a competitive American company.
Japan is able to undersell us in many 
electronics products. Cheaper labor is only a 
minor factor when we consider the tech
nology involved in the production of transis
tors and electronic components.
Research in Western Europe costs onefourth of what it does here. They employ 
less of their talent to military and space ad
vancements. Here, the bidding by space and 
military contractors for scientists and 
engineers creates a shortage for industry, 
hampering our private research. Many 
American companies are falling far short of 
their goals in recruiting drives.
Priorities should be established by 
government, Dr. Warner said, to avoid ex
cessive drains on the nations talent ... 
Perhaps we should continue our race with 
the Russians in space exploration; but let us 
not be unaware of the threat of the advanc
ing technology of Western Europe; nor too 
fast to laugh at a university president who 
calls our attention to it.
Editorial
Football Without a Team
Carnegie Techs Tartans have come a
4 long way from the famed football team that 
defeated the fighiting Irish of Notre Dame. 
This year only six freshmen came to Tech 
to try out for our football team. With the 
dropping of athletic scholarships, such as 
the Stephen Fund, and Techs catering to a 
more academically inclined freshmen class, 
the administrations emphasis on football is 
dwindling. Perhaps it will not be long be
fore a classroom or two sprouts upon our 
football field.
4 Tech now has only thirty men on its 
football roster. Our new coach will have a 
hard time training and outfitting two teams 
and have enough left over for the usual 
cases of sprained ankles and flu. Moreover, 
some new freshmen may drop out. With the 
stringent grade requirements for academic 
scholarships, very few good football players 
can qualify to go to Tech. Those, who are 
both good players and outstanding scholars 
are bid for by many other schools. Those who
* are excellent players but do not have a high 
scholastic rating are offered money by other 
schools under the cloak of academic schol
arships. Our team is beginning to feel the 
precarious position it was placed in when 
athletic scholarships were eliminated two 
years ago.
With the Stephen scholarship, Carnegie 
Tech could recruit prospective freshmen by 
offering them scholarships as long as they
^ are not on probation. Now, the only aid we
* can give football players is a regular aca
demic scholarship. Of course the Stephen 
fund was limited. However, some football 
players prefer an engineering school; and 
Tech, even though it may not offer as much 
money as other schools, has an edge over 
them in that respect. Although the grant only 
allows us to recruit three or four football 
players and one or two good basketball 
players, a few skillful men are an invaluable
^aid to a team over a period of four years. 
One must look at the men on our football 
team who have been or who are on Stephen
grants and observe how valuable they are. 
One must judge the men who have held 
grants and could not have gone through our 
school without them, to see if they were not 
our most competent players. There is no 
member of our administration who can 
truthfully state that the Stephen fund was 
worthless to our teams. To say that it had 
only little value is preposterous in view of 
the myriad of contradicting evidence.
The Stephen fund was named after 
Coach Wally Stephens, a judge in Chicago. 
It was an outright athletic scholarship. Not 
too long ago, a group of colleges objected to 
the practices of granting scholarships solely 
on an athletic basis, and giving the faculty no 
jurisdiction over such grants. The latter ob
jection was pacified when a committee was 
formed to screen the candidates for the fund.
Later, Carnegie Tech was turned down 
by some colleges in football competition be
cause we granted athletic scholarships. How
ever, we were purer than other colleges who 
granted academic scholarships but consid
ered athletic preformance as the principal 
factor. The pressures of two colleges, started 
the proceedings that culminated in the death 
of the Stephen fund. A board, chaired by 
Dean Brown convinced the Stephen fund 
donors that their money in general was hurt
ing us if given solely on an athletic basis. A 
regular grant and aid program was reim
bursed with the Stephen money. It is to give 
more people a chance for more money. Under 
this program, any student is elligible for a 
scholarship based on his need and academic 
progress. This change is to approach a 
system more comparable to Yales.
The return of a fund such as the Stephen 
scholarships would be a substantial advant
age to our team. Having one might bring 
complaints from other schools; but a good 
team with complaints is better than a poor 
one or perhaps none at all.
The best of luck to our new coach and 
our team for a successful season!

A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad 
In the Beginning
This article is meant to be an Introduction to the philo
sophy and prejudices of the writer. Many of the statements 
made and actions advocated in this space during the next 
school year will rely upon the thoughts published today.
I believe that it is a mistake to stop any individual 
from taking any action unless he directly harms another 
individual by his actions. In the realm of government this 
means that no government should legislate restrictions on 
many activities (such as taking narcotics, gambling, speak
ing, etc.). The reason for this desired limiting of societys 
power over any one person is that society may impose the 
majoritys ideas of what is moral and right on minori
ties. Many persons believe that such a forced conformity 
would be good (everyone should believe in God.) However 
I feel that society should be disregarded (or at least be con
sidered unimportant) when looking for the effect of re
strictions. Certainly most persons would violently object 
to any one person who orders them to stop speaking, writ
ing, or doing as they please because the person ordering the 
halt feels the speaking etc. is bad. Yet, when a majority 
decides writing pornography or showing too many westerns 
on T.V. is bad, the minority is expected to agree for the 
common good.
Perhaps such value judgments would not be so danger
ous if everyone could agree on what is right, but as long 
as one individual dissents, force must enter the picture. 
Simply because one view is held by a majority is not evi
dence that it is correct  at one time the world was thought 
to be the center of the universe, and anyone who said 
otherwise was in trouble. Every time a deviate is made to 
obey some statute which he opposes, freedom is lost. And 
this poses a danger for every other individual who thinks 
himself better than society. In other words, the doctrine 
being expounded is one of the allowing maximum freedom 
to the individual.
The ideas above are applicable to a wide range of in
terests: an economic system which would allow more free
dom to individuals, and more rewards for creativeness and 
intelligence would be preferred to the present one  and 
this could result by enforcing strong anti-trust laws ap
plicable to both corporations and unions, etc. This will be 
gone into more thoroughly at some other time; Tech could 
increase individual freedom by allowing girls to live offcampus; Pennsylvania might allow persons to legally be
come prostitutes if they choose to; and so on.

*Theta Xi Chapter Integrates 
Culture with Fraternity Life
Pi Chapter of Theta Xi Frater
nity has been chosen for an ex
periment which may have major 
impact on fraternity life on U. S.
 college campuses. Adapting the 
role of the social fraternity to the 
changing conditions of the postSputnik college life has been a 
major concern for most national 
fraternities. Theta Xi Educa
tional and Charitable Foundation 
recently appropriated a substan
tial grant to finance an experi
ment on the Carnegie campus 
aimed at giving new meaning to 
fraternity life.
^ Recognizing that the pace of 
technological progress is exerting 
tremendous pressure on college 
curriculums, the Theta Xi Foun
dation has sought methods of 
rounding out the education of the 
technical student supplementing 
the college classroom. The aim of 
the foundation is to show that the 
social fraternity can prepare the 
college student for a rewarding
* personal life while the college 
& prepares him for a successful
busines life. A formal cultural 
program has been worked out and 
will be financed by the found%- 
tion. Pi Chapter of Theta Xi has 
agreed to be the first chapter to 
test th program. Should the re
sults prove worthwhile, the pro
gram will be offered to the other 
70 odd Theta Xi chapters around 
the country, and to other frater. nities.
^ The program will be planned 
and administered by a board con
sisting of three members of Pi 
Chapter, a representative of the 
Foundation, and a member of the 
Carnegie Tech administration. 
The actives will hear a series of 
guest lecturers covering art, liter
ature, music and philosophy. 
Other speakers from business or
ganizations will discuss the actual 
challenges of the business and sciC entific world, with emphasis on 
what successful executives have 
found most important in building 
a career. Attending concerts of 
the Pittsburgh Symphony and 
other musical groups, and tours 
of art galleries and exhibits will 
be a part of the program. In ad
dition, a library of classical music 
and art books will be maintained 
in the fraternity house.
Although the Theta Xi Foun
dation has established the funda
mental concept and will super
vise the carrying out of the pro
gram, much of the responsibility 
will be carried by the Pi Chapter. 
Actives will be consulted fre
quently to be sure that the con
tent of the program is meeting 
their needs, and that the lectures 
and tours are interesting as well 
as instructive.
Success of the program will be 
measured in terms of the reaction 
of the participating actives, and 
the amount of material which is 
assimilated. There is no thought 
that every active will develop a
sophisticated taste in art, music, 
and literature but a reasonable 
proportion of them should develop 
a liking for one or more of these 
cultural activities. At the same 
time, the career guidance phase 
of the program will be analyzed 
very closely. Participants in the 
program will be asked to evalu
ate the effect of the counseling on 
their choice of jobs and careers. 
In time a more sophisticated study 
may be undertaken using a statis
tical research team currently 
working on another project for 
the Theta Xi Foundation at a 
nearby campus.

Axelrad Continues Thesis
(continued from page 3)
In any case the decision as to what increases freedom, 
and what is direct harm, must (or more correctly, in my 
opinion, should) be decided by a majority. It is being argued 
here that the principle of maximizing individual freedom 
with a few restraintsshould be accepted or at least given 
careful consideration. It is not desired that any statement 
made be accepted on faith, but that that the points that 
have been brought up, and will be brought up in the future, 
be discussed and argued on their merits.

Just about the time you figure your Word master should

enough ink left to go on writing for quite a while. You 
shouldnt be surprised. For even though Wordmaster 
is slim and streamlined, it has a much larger ink capac

about the most inexpensive dollar pen around.
By the way... you can get a handsome matching

Season Soloists, Program
The Pittsburgh Symphony Or
chestra will present twenty-two 
instrumental soloists at Syria 
#Mosque during the coming con
cert season which begins Friday 
evening, October 4 and continues 
through next April. Included 
among the solo artists will be 
such world famous names as 
pianists* Rudolf Serkin, Robert 
Casadesus, and Van Cliburn; vio
linists Issac Stern, Zino Francescatti, and Yedhuli Menuhin; and 
cellist Zara Nelsova. The long 
list of guest soloists represents 
one of the strongest conceit line
ups in the entire history of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. 
Season tickets are now cm sale 
for the twenty-two pair of sub
scription concerts, and an illus
trated brochure detailing the en
tire concert season is also avail
able by writing to Symphony, 
1305 Farmers Bank Building, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 1522.
% Many of the guest artists 
scheduled to appear with the or
chestra this season are familiar 
and poular with area concert 
audiences, but there are a num
ber of soloists who will be mak
ing their first appearances with 
the orchestra in solo roles. Among 
them will be cellists Mstislav 
Rostropovich and Michael Grebanier. Rostropovich is one of the 
great Russian artists currently
 making appearances in the West
ern World, and Grebanier was 
recently appointed principal cell
ist of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra.
The Pittsburgh Symphony Or
chestra will be directed by seven 
conductors this season. The list 
will include William Steinberg, 
Music Director of the orchestra, 
Haig Yaghjian, Associate Con
ductor, and guest conductors 
John Pritchard, Rafael Kubelik, 
Andre Vandernoot, and two young 
American maestros who will be 
selected in the next few weeks.
Steinberg, of course, will di
rect the major portion of the 
37th annual concert season of 
the Pittsburgh  Symphony Or
chestra. Beginning with the open
ing concerts, Friday evening Octoiber 4, and Sunday afternoon, 
October 6, Steinberg will conduct 
sixteen pair of the subscription 
concerts, Yaghjian, the new Asj sociate Conductor will have two 
pair of subscription concerts this 
season.
Two of the five visiting con| ductors have appeared with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
in the past year. A third was 
I last heard nearly ten years ago. 
Both John Pritchard, Music Di
rector of the London Philhar
monic Orchestra, and Andre Van
dernoot, Belgiums 'leading music 
figure, appeared in Pittsburgh last 
season. Pritchard made his Amer
ican debut with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony at the Syria Mosque. 
Kubelik is better known in 
Europe, but did appear here with 
the Pittsburgh Symphony ten 
years ago.

to be worthwhile in life. Hope
fully, the freshmen identified 
themselves with one or more of 
the speakers, and through the dis
cussion group which ensued, they 
came to appreciate more the ideas 
of others.
Wednesday night offered a wide 
choice of activities. There were 
square dancing, a short presenta
tion by the dramat staff, a ven
triloquist, and finally the cheer
leaders and the Tartan Scottie 
came up and lead the Freshmen 
in Tartan cheers. The program 
was interrupted by a downpour, 
which made it necessary for 
everyone to mix a little more in 
one of the dancing halls. Even 
some of the sailor hat boys (staff 
j| members for those not present) 
got up the nerve to ask the fresh
man girls to dance. Camp was 
quite liberal that night and all 
stayed out till midnight . . . sec
ond night away from the folks so 
the counselors had to break em 
in easy!
To the disappointment of all the 
group Gary and Larry were on 
the ball again Thursday morning, 
and the bagpipes and Tech songs
came blasting through loud and 
clear on the loud speakers. After 
a hazy-eyed breakfast there was a 
final gathering for speeches, last 
minute instructions, and thanks 
for the staff. Finally the big camp 
cleanup was underway and two 
lucky frosh were fortunate 
enough to pick up more orange 
peels, gum wrappers, candy bar 
wrappers, and other miscellany 
than any other frosh . . . what 
was their prize anyway?
While waiting for the buses the 
staff expressed their sincere ap
proval of the way Mr. Jones does 
the Hula Hoop, sang Happy 
Birthday to Hedda Bluestone (it! 
was not her birthday but there 
: was not anything else to sing! ! !), 
i organized their own pipe and I 
drum corps with the aid of Ian | 
and his tuneful nose, and general, ly sang it up.
The buses were eventually load
ed and whisked away to Pitts
burgh, and again Camp Lutherlyn 
stood idle, the fortunate victim of 
an attack by the enthusiastic, 
lively, screaming, % singing (also 
hoarse!) and unified CLASS OF 
1967.

Support Intramural Athletics 
Join Varied Activities
Intramural atheltics get very 
little publicity during Freshman 
Orientation. Unless one joins a 
fraternity or becomes associated 
with a dormitory team, he will not 
participate in a single intramural 
athletic event; nor will he care 
to.
This is unfortunate, since Car
negie Tech boasts one of the finest 
collegiate intramural athletic pro
grams in the United States. It as
sumes a greater importance than 
most intramurals at other colleges 
because of the de-emphasis of 
varsity sports at Tech. Neverthe
less, many of Techs students know 
little about the machinery that is 
able to run twenty-two different 
sports in which almost threequarters of the student body is 
able to participate.
Administration Endorsement
There is no doubt that intra
mural athletics offer the indivi
dual student a great opportunity 
for relaxation, physical fitness, 
competition, friendship, and a 
doggone good time. They are fully 
endorsed by the school admin
istration.
Intramurals play an important 
part in campus life and I hope 
all students who are physically 
able to do so will take full ad
vantage of them! President 
Warner.
These contests offer diversion 
from a strenuous study schedule 
and the fun of competing with 
other organized groups. They help 
to develop many personal traits 
which future employers will value 
 self-control, friendliness, and 
a well-rounded personality. F. M. 
Cratsley, Director of Athletics.
Anyone can participate in in
tramurals. No special athletic abil
ity is necessary.
It is the desire of the governing 
bodies of the Intramural Athletic
Department to provide a program 
of the widest possible scope. Keep
ing in mind the purposes and aims 
set forth, we feel that there is an 
activity for you, which will afford 
you the opportunity to participate 
regardless of past experience or 
skill. E. L. Boyer, Director of In
tramural Athletics.
Organization
The main governing body of the 
Intramural Department is the In
tramural Board whicth is super
vised by the Director of Intra
mural Athletics. The board con
sists of six fraternity men chosen 
by C.F.P., dormitory men chosen 
by Dormitory Council, two inde
pendent, and one representative 
from the Intramural Managers 
Club. These men work out rules, 
regulations, changes, protests, and 
forfeits concerning intramural 
contests. Its purpose is set forth 
in Article II, Section 1 of its con
stitution.
The purpose of this organiza
tion is to promote student health 
and physical efficiency, to foster 
a spirit of enthusiasm, good 
sportsmanship, and a healthful 
rivalry through a medium of com
petitive athletics.
All Sports Trophy
In order to enhance competition 
in intramurals, and emphasize the 
minor sports, the Intramural pro
gram was revamped three years 
ago under the direction of Eu
gene Boyer. A point system was 
instituted, and the organization 
gaining the most points during the 
school year is presented with the 
All Sports trophy, emblematic 
of supremacy in intramural sports 
for that year.
The point system that applies to 
the All Sports trophy is out
lined below.
Major sports are designated by 
the Intramural Constitution. InterSO I

mediate sports have ninety or 
more participants, and minor 
sports have less than ninety. It is 
obvious from this long list of 
sports that the Intramural Depart
ment is a large, sprawling organi
zation which must be well organized to function at all.
Intramural information is al
ways posted on the intramural 
bulletin board in the athletic 
building and also on the dormitory 
bulletin boards when new seasons 
open. Anyone interested in learn
ing more about the program 
should see Mr. Boyer in his office 
or call John Oppenheimer at 683- 
5872 or Bob Mercer at 682-9412. 
Also, anyone interested in earn
ing money by refereeing ball 
games should get in touch with 
one of these three men. The rate 
is one dollar per game and new 
officials will receive training be
fore the season begins.
In the fall, fraternity rosters 
are held open in order to include 
pledges who are eligible to play 
immediately upon pledging a 
house.
As one can easily see, the spirit 
of intramural athletics represents 
participation in many sports. If 
youre looking for the thrill of 
competition, the friendship of 
teamwork, the glory from win
ning, or just relaxation from stu
dies, try intramurals.
