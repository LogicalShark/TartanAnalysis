TARTANS WIN THREE GAMES DURING WEEK
Washington & Jefferson 
Loses Return Contest 
on Home Floor
PLAID PLAY WEAKENED
American University and 
Georgetown Easily 
Defeated
Carnegies Varsity floor squad, 
having lost but one member by 
the draft of examinations, resum
ed its activities by annexing three 
straight wins within the past week. 
To prove that the traditional 
Washington and Jefferson jinx had 
actually been vanquished for the sea
son, the Tartans helped themselves 
to. the enviable side of a 38-24 
tally on the Presidents floor. The 
American University quintet, of 
Washington, D. C., was next to 
succumb to the attack of'the Scots, 
losing by a ten point margin, 
31-21; and to close the week, 
Georgetown also went down in dc.icat 35-20. Thus the score book 
for the second semester remains 
clear of defeats.
Tartans Under Par 
It is true that the brand of ball 
displayed by the Plaid machine 
during the last three games has 
not been on a par with that of 
previous encounters, yet each time, 
Captain Ncasc and his cohorts evi
denced sufficient strength and 
cleverness to gain and hold a safe 
lead over their opponents.
Tuesday night, while most stu
dents were trying to unravel the 
intricacies conventionally encoun
tered in making out new schedules, 
Coach Iiogan had his squad at 
Little Washington fighting it out 
with Carnegie's old rivals, the 
"Proxies. Having experienced a 
tough time in downing the W. & 
J. Gagers on their home floor, the 
Tartans expected  evenmore trou
ble on the smaller floor at Wash
ington, and were not disappointed 
even slightly. For a full thirty 
minutes it was a close game, the 
lead swinging from one side to the 
other until "Curly" Sicgal was in
jected into the play. Sicgal warm
ed up by sinking five field goals 
in short order to put the Carncgians in a safe lead, and to put 
the Presidents in somewhat of a 
confused state. The Tartans were 
clearly superior to their opponents, 
working the ball in under the bas
ket for close shots, while W. & J. 
was forced to resort to long attcmpts at the basket. Again the 
baskctccrs made history by win
ning as many games from the 
Presidents in one season as they 
had previously done since the iissumption of relationship with them.
Amcricah U. Weak 
Thursday marked the invasion 
of Carnegie by the first of two 
teams from Washington, D. C. 
The Tartans opened against the 
American Us as though they were 
going to have a good night, but 
befdre long the game dropped to a 
listless exhibition of play. The Skibos, perhaps at their worst for the 
year, were extremely fortunate, 
however, in that the opposition was 
even weaker. The Tartan offense 
usually found its way through the 
American defense, but to no avail,

Dance To Be Held 
After Bout Feb. 21
After the Syracuse-Carnegie 
Tech boxing match on Satur
day, February 21, a dance will 
be held in the Union. The 
dance promises to be as suc
cessful as the football and bas
ketball dances have been. The 
Syracuse-Carnegie bouts will 
be concluded about 9:45 and 
. the dancc will follow immediate
ly. The orchestra , has not 
befen obtained yet, but the 
committee in charge of the 
dancc" is making arrangements 
to secure a good one. The 
pricc of admission is $1.25 per 
couple.
Although formal  attendance 
at boxing matches is custom
ary in a great many colleges, 
the Carnegie Tech dance will 
be an informal one. One of 
the purposes of the dance is 
to encourage as many couples 
as possible to attend the box
ing match.

FRESHMEN WILL GIYE 
FRUITS OF CULTURE
Carnegie Alumni 
Represented In 
Artists Exhibit
Mildred Schmertz and Ray 
Simboli Receive 
Prizes
Carnegie Alumni are well repre
sented this year in the Twenty-first 
Exhibition of the Associated Artists 
of Pittsburgh which was opened 
last Friday, February 13, in the 
Carnegie Institute. A large num
ber of the four hundred works be
ing exhibited have been painted by 
graduates from the Art School at 
Carnegie.
Mildred Floyd Schmertz, 19, who 
is considered one of the ablest 
artists in Pittsburgh, received the 
Carnegie prize for the best group 
with "A Family Group a painting 
that shows the influence of the 
modern Italian school.
Raymond Simboli, a former stu
dent in the Art School, won first 
honors in still life with his com
position "A Pot of Ferns." This 
picture shows artistic skill in its 
unusual arrangement. ,
The Art Society honor for a 
portrait was given to Louise Per
shing, a special student in the Art 
School in 1927. Her picture, Mrs. 
Little, is a carefully modeled head 
which has been palled knifed and 
heavily wrought. Miss Muriel D. 
Ward, '27, was awarded Alumnae 
Prize for her painting Still Life.
Four-Act Comedy By 
Count Tolstoi, Ridicules 
Spiritualism
A four-act comedy, ridiculing spir
itualism, will be staged for six 
nights in the Little Theater, begin
ning tomorrow evening at 8:15 
o'clock. Fruits of Culture, the 
name of the play, was written by 
Count Liov Tolstoi. So far as can 
be ascertained, this is the first, pro
duction of the play in America. 
Tolstoi is one of the world's great
est novelists: This play reflects the 
same mood as his. colossal prose 
epic, War and Peace, where he 
dwells upon the elemental forces of 
the common people in contrast to 
the artificiality of the upper classas. 
"Fruits of Culture shows Tolstois 
unusualpowers of psychological 
analysis. In this he may be com
pared to Dostoyevsky.
The action takes place in Moscow 
about the period of 1850, and deals 
with both the Russian aristocrats 
and the peasants. Whereas it is 
usually the aristocrats who despise 
the peasants, in this play the peas
ants have a chance to despise and 
ridicule the aristocrats for their be
lief in spiritualism. The aristocrats 
marvel at the supernatural character 
of events and sights they see, while 
in reality it is the peasants who arc 
behind everything and arc laughing 
at their supposed superiors.
The members of the cast arc 
chosen from the ffeshman class and 
are under the direction of Prof. E. 
W. Hickman. This year's freshman 
class offers some of the best ma
terial as a whole that has been 
available for a number of years. 
The cast is doing excellent work 
and as this play is a portrayal of 
character, it gives a splendid oppor
tunity to test ability. The uppcr(Continued on Page Four)
Linden Will Hold Formal
A formal dancc for all freshman

will be held at Linden hall Friday 
evening, February 20. This dance, 
which is an annual affair, will be

for the , evening has not vet been 
definitely chosen. As it will be a 
spring dance, Linden hall will be 
dccoratcd appropriately.

Jean Curtis, Jean Wilson and Julia 
Belle Gallup.

sentation of the Y. M. & W. I-I. A. 
Playhouse for'the present season, the 
performances being scheduled for the 
evenings of March 24, 25, and 26. 
This version pf the book was adapt
ed by Thomas Wood Stevens, former 
head of the Carnegie Drama depart
ment, whose presentation of the play 
in the Goodman Theater in Chicago 
was an overwhelming success. B. 
Iden Payne, likewise former head of 
the Carnegie Drama school, and now 
directing the Goodman Theater in 
Chicago, will supervise the produc

by Helen R. Stout, formerly con
nected with the Drama department 
here.
It is noteworthy that in this pro.- 
duction of the Y Playhouse as 
well as those in the past, the pro
duction staff, as well as the cast, has 
been composed largely of Carnegie 
instructors and students. Mr. Payne, 
whose work has been largely re
sponsible for the success of the 
Carnegie Little Theater has also 
been associated with the Y play
house sincc its inception as a civic 
theater. He served as its supervis
ing director during its first two years 
of existence, then was called to Chi
cago to' direct the Goodman theater 
there, returning annually during two 
seasons to appear as guest star in 
"Y playhouse productions. While in 
Chicago lie appeared in Steven's pro
duction of Around the World in SO 
Days, the vehicle which lie is now 
offering to the Playhouse audience.
Mrs. Stout whose recent direction 
of The Adding Machine was highly 
commended by local critics, will 
collaborate with Payne in the pre
sentation, while Frank Stout, will 
produce the settings.
The Y Playhouse, in its selec
tion of Around the World in 80 
Days, is adhering to its policy of 
including in each seasons list of 
productions examples of various types 
of the drama.
College Men Selected by Industry;
Explains Essential Qualities Needed
A survey of the opinions of men 
prominent in industry today, on the 
the various industries, was recently 
revealed at a conference at Lehigh 
University.
Bancroft Gherardi, vice president 
and chief engineer of the American 
Telephone and Telegraph Company 
said a survey of the Bell Telephone 
System showed that on January 1, 
1930, there were monj than 14,000 
college graduate employees. They 
constitute a most important part of 
the supervisory personnel and hold 
about a third of all the supervisory 
positions.
Declaring tact an essential to be
coming completely successful, Mr. 
Gherardi added:
One of my strongest convictions 
is that unusual effort may well be 
made to teach every engineering stu
dent to speak, and to write a report 
or letter in clear, convincing English, 
setting forth the facts and arguments 
and conclusions pertaining to the 
questions before him.
It is of. the greatest importance 
to state in correct and logical form 
the problem before him and to en
force his conclusions with arguments
which shall be convincing. Such train
ing as this is not merely one in liter
ature, composition or rhetoric, for to 
present such a report the problem 
must have been mastered and clear 
thinking must prcd clear speaking 
or writing.
F. A. Merrick, president of the 
Westinghouse Electric and Manufac
turing Companj', declared the most 
frequently heard criticism of the 
technical man is that he is lacking 
in human understanding and in ac
quaintance with the world of affairs, 
and along with these deficiencies he 
is very often lacking in the exercises 
of adequate expression in speech or 
writing, especially on the subjects in
volving anything outside purely tech
nical subjects.
What industry wants, he said, 
"is men who can and will do some 
one thing better than it has ever 
been done beforewho can add some
thing to the sum of human experi
ence, whether that experience has to 
do with design or manufacture or 
research, or selling, or administra
tionand the technical man who is 
properly qualified  and trained and 
willing to work has no limit to his 
possibilities in the electrical manuCommittee Plans 
Annual Greek Formal
Friday, March 6, has been set

later date.
In the *near future tickcts will be

COLLEGE HEADS REVISE 
SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS
Recognizing the necessity for new 
methods of meeting individual stu
dent needs, President Morgan of 
Antioch and President Hutchins of 
Chicago have, announced plans for 
orienting the inefficient student and 
facilitating the progress of the more 
intelligent.
Antioch College, Yellow Springs,
O., has expanded its plan of divid
ing the student's time between' 
classes and actual work. Many stu
dents vlio want to find jobs for the 
required length of time arc unfit to 
take them because of lack of ex
perience. To obviate this difficulty 
a professor of work has been ap
pointed. He supervises glen gangs 
in the actual, strenuous work of 
cultivating parts of the collcgc land, 
and painting and repairing collegc 
buildings. Skilled and unskilled 
men and women arc included in 
each gang and t'lreir wages in
creased in proportion to their im
proved efficiency. President Morgan 
says, in descril ing this experiment, 
Some of them are our most bril
liant and studious people, often 
representing wealthy and intellectual 
homes, who are simply inexperi
enced in facing responsibilities and 
in meeting practical situations.

PAGE TWOTHE CARNEGIE TARTAN/TUESDAY, 1<*EBRUARY 17, 1931.
SPORTS AND ALUMNI NEWS
mExzxpm
THE FACT THAT CARNEGIE WILL HAVE a formid
able array of trackmen this coming season might be assumed 
from the performances of several members of the squad who 
competed in the West Virginia Indoor Meet last Saturday.
Outstanding in the competition were Captain "Ray Barger 
and Tom Coulter. Ray, favored by many to win the pole 
vault, was unable to adjust himself to the existing conditions 
and came in for but a tie for third place. Coulter, the sopho
more champ, sprained an ankle just before the meet got under 
way and was forced to drop out of the high-hurdlcs. Despite 
his handicap, however, he flashed through for a third in the 70- 
yard low-hurdles, trailing only Callaway, the former record 
holder and Egleston, Michigan star, who set a new record for 
the meet by making the 70-yard dash in 8.1, only one-tenth of 
a second short of the worlds record.* * * * *
CARNEGIE'S VARSITY SWIMMERS opened their sea
son with a rather disastrous Eastern trip. The tankers were 
downed by both Franklin and Marshall and Delaware U, F. & M. 
scoring a 45-16 victory, and Delaware claiming a 47-21 margin. 
Easterbrook and Looney were the only men to win firsts in 
either meet. Looney added his five-pointer in the breaststroke 
against F. & M. while Easterbrook came in first in the 220 
free style at Delaware; he also copped second place in diving 
in both meets.* * * * *
THE PLEBE FLOORMEN, not to be  outdone by the 
Varsity, also added three victories to their record during the 
pastTweck. The first game, a return engagement with the 
W. & J. freshmen, marked the final appearance of two Carnegie 
yearling stars because of scholastic ineligibility. These boys, 
Radabaugh and Jagnow, were winning factors in the 27-18 
defeat handed the young Presidents.
A revised line-up was tried out, against the Beta Sigma 
Rhos Inter-Fraternity entry. The Plcbc quint found the Beta 
Sigs easy picking and handed them a 35-12 setback. To con 
tinue their pacc, the Baby Tartans downed the Pitt Junior Col
lege outfit from Johnstown, 35-12.
* H< >< * *
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO TO-DAY, Bert Munhall 
made his debut on the Carnegie campus, succeeding Frank 
Kelley as athletic trainer. "Bert came to the Tartans from the 
Central Basketball League, of which he had been trainer for some time. And to go back a little farther, we find that he 
had played football for both the Homestead Steel Works team, 
and the Western University of Pennsylvania, or what is nowadays called Pitt. Incidentally, today is also Berts birthday.
* * * *
DOC MARKS THINKS ITS A PRETTY GOOD JOKE
that Bert Munhall went all the way to Mineral Wells, Texas, 
to make sure that absence isnt making her heart grow fonder for somebody else. At the same time, Doc is trying to reduce 
his waist-line and is getting all decked out for his annual trip 
to Californiaand Hollywood. ...He is going to training camp with the Pittsburgh Pirates, so he says, but theres a pretty 
, well-founded rumor floating around that hes going to see a cer
tain actress in person.#
THOSE WHO ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY of altanpling to entertain the spectators at Saturday nights game
with wisecracks in reference to the exhibition bout between
Cliff Carr and Mike Rcstaine, might like to know that 
Rcstnine crawled out of bed after a two days siege of grippe to entertain them. His breathing, impaired by a cold, and his 
vitality lowered by the grippe still in him, resulted in a slow 
fight during the first two rounds. With Carrs punch to the jaw in the last round, however, Mike opened up with his 
typical calibre of aggressiveness and things soon became in
teresting.* * * *' *
ANOTHER THING THAT THOSE WHO VAINLY 
tried to be funny should know is that under Intercollegiate 
Boxing rules such a demonstration of jeering may result in 
the referees giving the home contestant a foul. Those who appreciate intercollegiate boxing bouts, in which all six minutes 
are similar to the last minutes of the Carr-Restaine bout, will 
be courteous enough to refrain from voicing any opinion what
ever. Others should keep quiet out "of respect for their school.
The National ^ollegiate Athletic Association rule regarding 
such cases states that a foul may be given for coaching or 
words of advice or encouragement from spectators, or applause, when in the opinion of the referee and judges the occasion 
warrants.

WASHINGTONS BIRTHDAY DANCEFEBRUARY 23 
MENS GYMNASIUM
Wc are told this is the month of 
February, just as if we couldnt 
Ji'fid it out ourselves. But the 
strangething about the month is 
that it is a perfect month. You 
dont know what a perfect month 
is? Well, it is a month which be
gins on Sunday and ends on Satur
day, has four weeks, and contains 
seven days in the week. Its funny 
they couldnt be nights just as well 
as days, because wc operate at 
night. The month is just about 
half over now, and it wont be 
long before the end is reached.
Yes, Ill be on hand for the 
Washingtons Birthday Dance over 
1 in the Gym. You better arrange 
to be there, too. I was there last 
year, and Im telling? the world 
that they sure did have some big 
doings. This night will be an oti 
night from school work for which 
1 am glad, because there is noth
ing like a big stiff assignment to 
make one down in the dumps.
Did you ever notice how easy it 
is for some other person to come 
along and pick to pieces the life 
of some person who has lived 
his life some years back; but they 
dont stop at that, sometimes the 
pastime is indulged in while the 
maligned person is still living.
iWhat I have reference to is the 
recent publication of a book on\
thc life of Abraham Lincoln. It 
is amazing how some of these
writers have the audacity to Haunt 
at us a long series of arguments 
and reasons why an ountstandlng 
character in history should not be 
held in .revcrcnce, but flung down 
to the lowest depths of scorn and 
contempt. One docs not have to 
go very far to arrive at a conclu
sion that it is very difficult for 
a person to write intelligently
about something which has hapt pened before his time. It is not
| possible to have all the facts to
./ prove, a case, especially when it
' *- ,co.mc.s' to the life of some indi
vidual. Take any history and you 
get the view point of the individual 
who is writing it, and not the true 
I* facts as the)- really were. We arc
I lold in the book that "Lincoln was
a cold man in a ludicrous plug 
hat, mannerless, unkempt and one 
wonders if he was not unwashed/' 
It is not denied that our beloved 
Lincoln had a good sense of hu
mor, but this asset is minimized
by the statement that this was the 
only magnet which drew people to 
him. We are also told that he was 
a man of low intelligence, a clum
sy social climber and not a man
of the people." At all events,
there will still be an exceedingly
large number of loyal Americans 
who will hold Abraham Lincoln in 
. deep reverence and look up to 
him as the emancipator of our 
, country, and why shouldnt they?
A Paid Pea Shooter is the 
title of an article in one of the 
daily papers. Just what kind of 
an occupation is this? If it is one 
which does not involve much work, 
. I think Ill apply for it. The facts
given are as follows: Folks have 
to be awakened in the' morning in 
order to get up for work  the 
place is London, Englandand 
London is a dark and gloomy 
city so the possibility of using the 
Sun as on alarm clock is out of 
the question, hence the pea shoot
er. Every morning, armed with 
0 a quantity of peas and a pipe the
pea shooter goes forth and blows 
, a bunch of peas at the window of
one of his customers and the rattat-tat of the peas is guaranteed to 
waken even the most sound sleeper. The pea shooter draws a few
pennies per week for the work. 
Wonder how this occupation would 
jyosper in Pittsburgh?

GALA AFFAIR ARRANGED 
FOR WASHINGTONS 
BIRTHDAY DANCE
Carl Ludwigs Orchestra 
Engaged For 
Occasion
The Washingtons Birthday Dance 
of the Night Student Council will 
be held in the Mens Gymnasium 
on February 23. A very elaborate 
affair is planned for the occasion 
and a large attendance is expected. 
Carl Ludwigs Orchestra has been 
engaged to furnish the music, and 
judging from the success of the 
last function which they played at, 
there will be nothing missing as to 
time, rythm, syncopation, etc.; in 
fact, they have everything a very 
fine orchestra has, and more too.
The Washingtons Birthday Dance 
is always the most important func
tion of the Night Student Council 
and this years affair will not be 
lacking of anything which has 
heretofore been offered.
There will be no school on this 
evening, so this will afford a splen
did opportunity for all the night 
students to indulge in a night of 
merriment. Come out and join the 
crowd in the festivities.
Notice to Night 
Student Council Workers
All the workers on the Night 
Student Council affairs arc ex
pected to be out next Sunday after
noon at 2:30 . p. m. at the Mens 
Gymnasium to work on the prepa
rations for the Washington Birth
day Dance which will be held on 
Monday, February 23.

Scholarship Awards 
For 1929-30 Made 
By Committee
The Scholarship Committee 6f 
the Night Student Council award
ed the three Night Student Coun
cil Activities Scholarships to the 
following night students.
In the College of Industries, 
Chester J. Biscup, a night student 
in the . Electrical.. Equipment,, and 
Construction Department. In the 
College of Engineering, Harold E, 
McGannon, a night student m the 
second year. In the College of 
Fine Arts, James H. Sansonetti, a 
night student in the. Department of 
Architecture.
These students have earned the 
awards by their loyalty to the 
various activities sponsored by the 
Night Student Council," and have 
proven that it is possible to engage 
in the extra-curricula activities as 
well as attend to the important 
feature of college, namely, studies. 
The Plaid wishes to congratulate 
these students upon earning the 
awards.
There will be no school on Mon 
day, February 23, the occasion of 
Washingtons Birthday. On this 
evening, the Night Student Council 
is holding its big dance of the 
year. Better make arrangements 
to attend.
NIGHT ARTS HOLD 
VALENTINE DANCE
The surprise the Plaid promised 
was in the way of a Valentine 
Dance held bjr the Night College 
of Fine Arts on February 7 in the, 
Union, and fully measured up to 
expectations. The social committee 
of the Night College of Fine Arts 
certainly know how to put on an 
affair.
The decorations used were red 
and white hearts, and the favors 
were equally as attractive and con
sisted of small hearts filled with 
candy.
A new orchestra furnished the 
music and made such an impres
sion that a return engagement has 
already been arranged for.
Too much praise and thanks 
cannot be given to those who were 
responsible for the success of. the 
evening. All we can say is, don't 
miss any more dances.

Too manjr books this time to 
give you a preliminary warning. 
Off the deep end:
THIRTEEN MEN is by Tiffany 
Thayer. Whether this writer is 
young or old is hard to fell, he 
happens to have one of those age
less faces. Whatever his age, 
however, he has written a very 
powerful novel in this that relates 
the lives of twelve good men, and 
true, up to the time they arc 
asked to serve on the same jury; 
and the life, or rather, the last 
chapters of the life of the man 
they try. Thayer is not backward 
in showing things as lie find: 
them and his pictures of seduction, 
rape, homosexuality, and murder, 
are to be shunned by readers who 
like, for instance, Elinor Glyn or 
James Oliver Curwood. Upon pain 
of losing the respect of at least 
two friends, I say here and now, 
that I liked the book but wish 
that Mr. Thayer is just a little 
more subtle in his next literary 
opus. Recommended.
LIVES' OF A BENGAL ^LANCER is by F. Yeats Brown. It 
relates his experiences in India as 
a soldier and otherwise, in India. 
Much Yogi philosophy is encoun
tered in reading the book. I liked 
it____
BACKSTREET by Fanny 
Hurst is slow-moving albeit inter
esting. It starts from the time 
girls who went out unchaperoned 
were considered fast and ends in 
the present era. Its about one of 
these girls.  If you like Fanny 
Hurst.
MOON OF DELIGHT is - by 
Margaret Bell Houston. If you 
like this one dont, by any means 
read "Thirteen Men.
PALM BEACH is another 
money-maker for Cornelius Van
derbilt, Jr. The same thing applies 
to this oneand I hope he goes 
back to being an eligible man in 
what might be laughingly called 
high society.
FOUR BLOCKS APART is by 
Arthur Somers Roche. While this 
one falls almost into the category 
of the above two books Mr. Roche 
writes much better. Recommended, 
E. Dc L.
PHI NU FRATERNITY TO 
HOLD SOCIAL PARTY
On Saturday evening, February 
21, Phi Nu Fraternity will hold a 
social party for its members at the 
Carnegie Inn on Woodlawn AvcPRESIDENT
Mr. James H. Sansonetti, Presi
dent of the Night Student Coun
cil. Mr. Sansonetti is registered in 
the Night College of Fine Arts and 
is a student in lie Department of 
Architecture. He has spent a num
ber of years on the campus and 
appreciates all the hardships which 
a night student encounters. He is 
an ardent student and is always 
willing, to help his fellow students 
whenever lie can.
PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE 
WHEN PARKING CARS
During the past week notice has 
came to the Plaid that the car of 
a night student was broken into 
and a suitcase stolen. The car 
was parked close to the Admin
istration building and the robbery 
occurred in the early evening.
Despite the patrolling of this 
section by city policemen there is 
a robbery of some sort every now 
and then. In the past there have 
been reported robberies of blank
ets, brief cases, drawing boards and 
many other kinds of school sup 
plies from students machines while 
parked on the campus. Spare tires 
have also been added to the list of 
necessities of the thief who preys 
upon the cars of innocent'night 
students.
Wc take this opportunity to 
warn every one who parks his car 
on the campus to be sure that ,tjic 
door's arc socurcly lockcd or, if 
an open car, that no property is 
left lying on the. scats or where 
it can be removed without a great 
amount of effort. Also dont bother 
any car but your own for the 
vigilance committee may miscon
strue your actions and call for an

Just give your home telephone num

FIGGERS TO PROVE IT
Arc you a three feet driver? 
Many of you arc, but you dont 
realize it. Then, too, there arc 
some of you who arc, but wouldnt 
change if a public demonstration 
proved the error of your ways. 
If you arc the latter type, turn to 
the next article or pick up a daily 
paperyoull never learn.
A three feet driver is one who 
for the proper protection of the 
curbstone, pavement, air space, 
spotless clothes, the Republican 
party and his automobile, parks his 
car not less than three (fcct away 
from the car in front of him or 
beside him, when parking hori
zontally or vertically, respectively. 
In many cases, lie uses five or six 
feet. By a simple process which 
you may have learned long ago, 
you can multiply three, four, five 
or six by one hundred, and the 
result is space large enough to 
accommodate thirty to one hundred 
additional cars. These figures arc 
not certified, but the conclusions 
here arc obvious.
The parking spacc closc. to the 
campus is limited. There may not 
be accommodations for all of us, 
but there is certainly more spacc 
than is actually being used'. From 
Morcwood avenue to the Arts 
building is far enough without hav 
ing to think, while walking that 
distance, that an accumulation of 
these not quite large enough spaces 
j around the campus would have 
eliminated all delay and blood 
pressure. If the reader doesnt 
concur in my observations, lie is 
invited to a privately conducted 
tour with the writer any night aft 
cr 7:30 oclock.

Michael and Mary
Next Monday night, a play acclaimed by critics and lauded 
by . the theater-going public is opening at the Alvin Theater. 
From the standpoints o culture and your own enjoyment this 
is important to you. But what is even more important is the 
fact that this opening performance of "Michael and Mary is being sponsored by the Womens Scholarship Organization and 
that their annual benefit is the only opportunity that you have 
to help them carry on their worthy purpose.They need your individual aid more than you can realize. 
A benefit of this nature involves a tremendous financial respon
sibility for an undergraduate group, and it is your duty to make 
this undertaking seem a smaller risk. If the proper support is forthcoming from the student body, there will be no element of 
chance or uncertainty.Alumni and friends of the school have given splendid re
sponse to the appeal of the Womens Scholarship Organization, 
but the response and even the interest of the students has been 
up to this point, negligible. The original purpose of this association was to create an arrangement whereby students would 
be able to help other students in a manner from which all 
could derive pleasure and satisfaction. Do not lose sight of 
the fact that the major part of. the financial aid is expected from 
you.The annual scholarship benefit should be and always has 
been a gala event for Carnegie. The highest form of philan
thropy is one where the giving is pleasurable for the donor and where there is not self-consciousness on the part of the recip
ient. No one can deny that such is the case here, and it is for 
you to prove the efficiency of this ideal as a working^asis.
Boxing
The noble art of boxing will have its local premiere in the 
Carnegie Gymnasium Saturday evening when the Tartan squad 
engages Syracuse. Because this will be the first home appear
ance of the Carnegie squad, and because the sport is on a trial 
basis; Clarence Overend is anxious to have a large attendance 
at: the affair.There are certain rules of etiquette in vogue at intercollegiate bouts which were sadly violated at the exhibition 
last Saturday evening. Cheers and cat-calls may be all right 
at professional fights but they arc distinctly out of order in 
college circles. Applause is prohibited until the termination of 
each bout; this method is the only fair one to the visiting team. Sportsmanship is something Carnegie students and Carnegie 
teams have possessed. Lets not forget it: Saturday night I

also discuss short sales and the 
function of the market as a busi
ness barometer.
Mr. Meeker entered financial 
journalism after his graduation from 
Yale as an honor student. For the 
past ten years he has held the posi 
tion of economist of the New YorkStock exchange, during which time 
lie has carried on research workdealing with the comparison of 
methods of conducting business on 
the New York exchange with those 
in other world financial centers. His 
book, which has recently been re
vised, is considered one of the few 
comprehensive studies of the or
ganization with which he is con
nected.
Howdy, You All!
Glad to see youre still in school. 
Thank you, Im glad to be here 
myself. The better half of the year 
is upon us, and you may look for
ward to the Intcrfratcrnity, AllHonorarics, Senior Ba.ll, Campus,. 
Week, and, for the selcct few, 
Commencement Ball. .Or, ifyou 
prefer, there are Mid-Semester and 
Final Exams to think about.  But 
who prefers?
The last basketball dance of tho 
year was held Saturday night, after 
the Georgetown game. From now 
the Saturday night Union 
dances will be boxing shows, and, 
perhaps, tennis or track thereafter. 
The dance must go on, it seems. 
It certainly is a Dragon our pockctbooks. (All right, excuse me.)
The basic ctball I cam continues to 
win 'cm. They arc also becoming 
temperamental. They insist on going 
from tlic field house in Margaret 
Morrison to the Gym by way of 
Woodlawn avenue and the side door 
of the Gym instead of using the . tun
nel from the field house to the Gym. 
Even on the coldcit night they use 
the outdoor route bccausc it's bad 
luclc to go through the tunnel before 
a game.
The basketball crowds at the last 
two games have had a tendency 
to forget their basketball etiquette. 
At the Georgetown game the offi
cials were treated to various forms 
and shapes of the well-known 
razzberry. Whether, the officials 
are any good, or not, intcrcollc' 
giate basketball is supposed to be 
"sport for sports sake and 
shouldnt be taken too seriously.
At the American University 
game Thursday night the playboys 
picked out one particular player 
on the visiting team and, due to 
some pccularity of his playin 
made public the fact that he was 
the subject of a very funny hoax. 
The boy played a pretty good 
game, at least doing his best scri' 
ously, and it didn't seem the right 
thing to laugh aloud at him, or 
to go so far as to ridicule him 
publicly.
Monday night the Women's Scho 
larship Association will hold forth 
at the Alvin Theater, where the pro 
duction "Michacl and Mary" will be 
given as their annual benefit per 
formancc. This annual event is Car
negie's closest approach to Grand 
Opera, as all tlic big titles are present 
as well as Student Council in formal 
attire. The latter attraction should 
be sufficient. If that doesnt bring 
you, the lidos that the Crucns will 
sell candy (not made by them) 
should'decide your mind.
The first home boxing match 
will be held Saturday night I From 
the exhibition bout between halves 
of the Georgetown basketball 
game, the bou,ts should be popular, 
when the boys have something to 
fight for. Syracuse will furnish the 
opposition. A dance will follow.

In operfing the home season, Cartake the boys over, judging from
npgies Plcbc swimmers paddled 
away from tli.c South Hills High 
with a score of 35 to 24 . The 
Blcbcs kept all the first places 
to themselves, being extended in 
the relay and breast stroke only; 
The high school boys presented a 
team that was ' well within their 
keeping,'but they were simply out
done by the. more experienced 
yearlings.
Vandcr Lanckcn followed Thumbston, of South Hills, by mere 
inches at. th/s finish of the 100-yard 
breast St'rokc. While stroking 
backwards for 100 yards, Boyer 
took things easy and eventually 
first place in that event. Miller 
splashed through for first place in 
the 50-yard sprint and later added 
five more points in the 100-yard 
free style.
The diving act was ommittcd for 
the new board had not been placed. 
However, if South Hills had won 
all places in that event they would 
have been beaten.
Saturday, the Plcbcs matchcd 
their wares against better opposi
tion in the Press A. A. U. meet. 
The outstanding event of the day 
was th 2 performance of Paul 
Wyatt, A. M. A. champion of the 
senior backstroke and member or 
the Olympic teams of 1924 and 
1928. Carnegie was represented in 
this race by Ranny Boyer, fresh
man, who succeeded in rubbing 
elbows with t1' champion for two 
lengths. After this time the vet
eran pulled away and lead the 
field to the finish. Boyer finished 
an easy second with about ten 
feet to go for first placc. Pal 
Miller helped things along with 
his first place in the 30 yard 
scramble of the novice race.
Next Friday at 5 p. m. the Plcbe 
swimmers will meet the Taylor 
Allderdicc High School in the 
home pool. The freshmen should
the formers 38 to 28 victory of 
last year. Saturday the Skibo year
lings will take their big trip of 
the season to Cleveland. On .that 
day the University School will be 
very much in evidence to dupli
cate their 1930 triumph of 59 to 8. 
However, thi ycar!s squad of 
freshmen stand a good chance of 
p -venting history irom. repeating 
itself;

The passing, too, was ragged and

Georgetown Stubborn 
T o stage a comeback in great 
style; the Plaids displayed their 
best form since the Pitt game, al
though this could be disputed in 
connection' with the first half. Takng the floor for the second half 
with a 14-9 margin, the Tartans 
uncovered their typical style of 
play and ran up fourteen points 
before their opponents had scorcd. 
Georgetown rallied to register sev
eral points, but with five minutes 
to go, Coach Hogan entered his 
second team, which was successful 
in holding the Georgetowners on 
even terms for the remainder of 
the game. Bob Smith emerged 
high scorer as in the American U 
contest with a total of 15 pints.

THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
The Pornographic Puppet
Lest the editors of the worthy 
Puppet take offense at his lavish 
use of adjectives, let them be as
sured that the Public Nuisance 
holds no brief against them in par
ticular but merely chose their pub
lication as a title because of its 
euphonious quality. His remarks 
apply equally well, , if not even 
iViore so, to the triply pornographic 
Panther, Punch Bowl, Purple Par
rot or any other of the torrid 
comic magazines which disgrace 
collcgiana.
He has made more than a cur
sory study , of the collcgc humor 
periodicals, from the rockribbcd 
Dartmouth Jack OLantern, to the 
sunkisscd California Pelican, and 
from the Minnesota Ski-U-Mah to 
the Texas Longhorn. His researches 
though ^exhaustive Have proved 
nothing new, but they have served 
to emphasize one observation lie 
made many years ago when lie was 
receiving rejection slips from Life 
and Judge at. the -rate of one a 
Week.
Briefly, his conclusion is that the 
basis of undergraduate humor, at 
least that phase which is represent
ed by the typical college fun mag
azine, is nothing more nor less 
than dat old debbilSEX. Every 
cartoon stands saucily upon a pair 
of voluptuous silk stockings. Flimsy; 
pink step-ins prancc through the 
pages; nude silhouettes kiss at 
blind-drawn windows; plump femininc posteriors peep naughtily 
from beneath nuptial beds. Any
thing which is sexy is funny.. To 
cull a phrase from Euclid, the wit 
of today is risus asinorum.
To defend himself against the 
chargc of being naught, but a de
structive agent, the Public Nuis
ance must make some constructive
suggestions. Viola!!
Arc there no other funny things 
occurring about a collcgc campus 
than those matters rhich are 
scribbled upon the walls of lavator
ies and the pailings of alley fenccs? 
Is not the very essence of humor 
the casting of a spotlight upon the 
incongruities of mans behavior? 
Is not wit a scalpel-like cut which 
in an instant exposes the pathology 
of humanity, and holds it up to the 
ridicule, of the public? Is not a 
joke the rapid etching of the foibles 
of the mob? Why then, oh edi
tors, restrict thyself to sex?
Can you not have as much fun 
with gross exaggeration and hyper
bole? Can you not enjoy your
self by turning the blade of sharp 
tongued criticism upon the idio
syncrasies of university life? Is 
a fraternity house less fertile soil 
than a Rabelasian bedroom?' Is 
not the destruction of professorial 
dignity and pomp at least as belly 
shaking as the antics of the farm
ers. daughter and the travelling 
salesman?
If sex wc.rc not a forbidden sub
ject would it be usable? Does a 
naked buttock make an otherwise 
pointless anecdote screamingly 
funny? Are we at a university to 
have the same standards for wit 
and .humor as-* those cross-eyed 
morons who cultivate their libido 
by feasting upon the amorous car
toons in W.hizbang and Hot Dog? 
Since we have normal but hidden 
physiological functions become the 
acme of risibility?
Oh, editors! Is it not desirable 
that we make fun of peoples ac
tions besides their sex life? Could 
we not change our idol from Chic 
Sale to Peter A.r.no? It is not time 
th.a^ the. pornographic Puppet grow 
up and become mature?
