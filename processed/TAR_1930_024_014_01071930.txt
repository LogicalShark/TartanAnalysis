Rushing Rule Violations to 
Be Acted on by Council 
This Week
As a result of the Fraternity of 
Rushing Season 165 Freshmen-and 
15 Sophomores pledged at 17 of 
the social fraternities on the cam
pus. The total number that 
pledged after rushing season last 
year was about the same. One 
hundred and fifty of the new men pledged on the Sunday following 
the rushing season and most of the 
remaining thirty pledged before 
the Christmas recess.Although there are still a num
ber of conditions in the present 
rushing system that need remedy
ing, the system as a whole has 
proven to be much more satisfac
tory than the lead pipe' system 
used on most campuscs. The re
stricted rushing enables both the 
Freshmen and the Fraternities lo 
gain a clearer impression of each 
other than if the Freshmen were 
rushed at the first of school.
A number of violations of the 
Interfraternity Councils rushing 
rules have been reported to the 
rushing committee. At the Coun
cil meeting this week the commit
tee will make a report of its in
vestigations into the violations of 
the rijlcs and will reepmmend pen

Maya Civilization 
Topic Of Speaker 
In Little Theater
On Dccetnbcr 14, Dr. S}rlvanus 
Morlcy dcliA'crcd a lecture in the 
Little Theater on the subjcct Maya 
Civilization.
Dr. Morlcy in the course of his 
lecture said in part: Civilization in 
the western hemisphere first flour
ished in the heart of the Americas. 
The earliest dated object that we 
have found as yet corresponds to 
our date 98 B. C., and was found 
at Vera Cruz. As food was al
ways abundant, the natives had 
leisure time which they could devote 
lo improving their civilization. First 
thc3r turned their attention to a 
study of time and evolved a bet
ter calendar than we had in the 
sixteenth centur}r and as good a one 
as we have today. In the fourth or 
ifi-'th century A. D., these people 
emigrated to Yucatan and to Guatamala, those going North carrying 
more culture with them than those 
who went South.
Chicken-llzo was the greatest of 
all the Maya cities, and in the 
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries 
was a holy city. Most of the build
ings here have a medial cornice half
way up. Below this cornice the 
walls are plain; above it, the walls 
are sculptured.
At this town, we excavated and 
repaired the Temple of Warriors, 
si? named because we found 20 
brilliantly painted columns, carved 
with the figures of warriors. This 
temple had a colonade in front, be
sides a flight of steps and several 
terraccs. The temple, before its 
destruction, must have been extreme
ly beautiful.
The sacred deposits were placed 
beneath the sanctuary floor by the 
Mayas. Under the sanctuar}' floor, 
we found an urn of limestone, con
taining some jade beads and amulets,

Membership Drive 
Of Carnegie Guild 
Starts Next Week
Tags May Be Secured From 
Any Member Of The 
Organization
The week of January 13 has been 
designated by the Carnegie Guild 
as the week for its annual mem
bership drive. The membership card 
in the form of a tag costs 50 cents 
and can be secured from any mem
ber of the Womans Guild. This 
is the one time during the year 
that the Guild appeals to Carnegie 
students for monetary support, and 
it hopes that it will respond in the 
same generous spirit that it has in 
previous years.
The Carnegie Tech Guild was 
founded for philanthropic purposes 
by Miss Clara Linforth West', for
merly Dean of Margaret Morrison 
College. So far it has beei) very 
successful in its wo'rk; the fund 
which will be used for the found
ing of a summer camp for poor 
children increases each year with 
the addition of "a certain sum of 
money taken from the proceeds of 
"tag1 day.
In the past year, the Guild has 
completed many worthwhile pro
jects. It furnished a recreation 
room at Kingsley House," supplying 
curtains, pictures, and wicker furni
ture. One hundred dollars was given to the sinall mining town of 
Broughton, which was in need of 
financial backing. It also donated 
$20 to the Social Service Depart
ment of Allegheny Hospital to pro
vide medical care for certain pa
tients who were unable to finance 
their own treatments.
Agnes Power, the newly elected 
president of the Guild, has care
fully outlined a program for the 
clubs activities during 1930.

Ethel Barrymore 
Visits Drama Dept.
Ethel Barrymore, internationally 
famous actress who was playing 
here during the past two weeks in 
"The Kingdom of God and in 
"The Love Duel, and . Kenneth 
MacGowan who is -the producer of 
the play Children of Darkness 
which opened here recently, were 
guests of the Department of, Drama last week.
Miss Barrymore, 'who is very 
much interested in the department 
because of the part it takes in fur
thering the art of drama, visits 
Carnegie and the Little Theater 
whenever she has. a Pittsburgh en
gagement. She was particularly in
terested in the p'resent Russian 
Constructionist production, !^ope de 
Vegas The Gardeners Dog and 
regretted very much that she. was 
unable to attend a performance of 
the play.
Mr. MacGowan attended the 
production last Friday night.. He 
is also verjr much interested in the 
department, and in his recent book, 
Footlights Across America which 
is a study of non-professional thea
ters, he devotes considerable space, 
to a description of the Little Thea
ter and its activities.
Dr. Shultzs Vacuum Pump
Overwhelms Interviewer
A vacuum pump capable of eva
cuating to a pressure of 0.000012 
mm., and probably lower, has 
recently been completed by Dr. 
Lawrence II. Schultz of the Mar
garet Morrison Department of 
Chemistry.
To the interviewer, one unini
tiated into the darker mysteries of 
Physics, the pump appeared, at 
first sight to be nothing more than 
an unintelligible mass of glass tub
ing, glass bulbs, mercury, valves 
and mechanical contrivances with 
long names. But upon explanation 
and demonstration ,thc apparatus 
seems quite simpleat least in com
parison with the usual complicated 
and expensive laboratory vacuum pump.
The pump consists of an all 
glass apparatus combining the 
operation of an automatic pressure 
alternator and a modified Tocplcr 
pump. It is operated entirely by 
a water vacuum pump and is auto
matically self-sealing, requiring no 
attention or manipulation while in
operation. In plain (non-technical) 
English, the.  automatic pressure 
alternator, which is operated by 
the water vacuum pump, alternate
ly places atmospheric pressure upon 
and removes it from the modified 
Toepler part of the apparatus. 
This second pari; of the apparatus 
works through mercury  passing 
and rc-passing (controlled by the 
pressure alternator) across an open
ing connected to the/volume to be 
evacuated. At each rise and fall 
of the mercury, which controls a 
self-sealing valve, the pressure 
within the system to be evacuated 
is fraction-atedand so theoretic
ally the evacuation could continue 
to infinity.
Preliminary tests of the appara
tus have been made, in which an 
ordinary barometer manometer was 
drawn to practically a zero reading 
in quite a short time. A McLeod 
guage will be constructed to mea
sure accurately extremely low prcs(Continued on Page Four)

American Stage Has Noticeable Effect
On European DramaSays Boris Glagolin
Editors Note: This is part of -n 
articic, American Theater Emanci
pated/ by Boris Glagolin, former 
dinzctor of the Moscow Revolutionary 
Theater.
While still in Russia I heard 
that the Moscow Art Theater had 
an artistic success in America, al
though faring rather poorly finan
cially. I must confess that I at
tributed it not to the conservatism 
of the Moscovites,' but to the bad 
taste of the Yankees. Now, after 
my arrival in New York, I heard 
nothing but discourses on the in
fluence of the Russian Theater on 
the American stage. And yet, 
after two j'ears in the United 
States I see the problem in a dif
ferent light. There is a different 
angle to the financial failure of 
the Moscow Art Theater. I do not 
see wherein lies the great influence 
of the Moscovites; it is rather skin 
deep. It is quite negligible as 
compared with the influence of the 
American theater spreading all 
over the world. Oliver M. Saylcrs 
book on the Russian Theater is 
but a series" of pleasant compli
ments.
To obviate the accusation of a
similar nature regarding the Amer
ican stage I thougjit it wise to be
gin with a frank condemnation of 
those aspects of the American 
stage where it resells Europe at a 
generous discount, where it ranges 
itself along English fashion and 
admires the Russians.
In its external aspect, beginning 
with the physical construction oi 
the stage, lighting, repertory of 
plays, settings, and the mise-enscenes, it merely plays up to all 
the achievements of the European 
stage. Even so, wh.cn the Ameri
cans repeat this very l-vit word of 
theatrical Paris, London, Moscow, 
or Berlin, they say it with such 
an American accent that one is in
clined to forget even the betrayal 
of originalitythis eminent hall
mark of genuine art. The scale it
self and the perfection oi tech
nique put into this reproduction of 
European art have their signifi
cance; they either compromise the 
European patterns or else disclose 
these precious elements which were 
lost in Europe. In this ability; to 
transform everything is obviously 
the source of the American Thea(Continucd on Page Four)

President Baker 
Announces New 
Graduate Courses
Graduate courses leading to the 
Doctors degree in Metallurgy will 
be offered by the Department of 
Mining and Metallurgy, College of 
Engineering, beginning next fall, Dr. 
Thomas S. Baker announced this 
wCek. This announcement marks a 
new departure iii the policy of Car
negie, inasmuch as the graduate work 
now being given in metallurgy leads 
only to a masters . degree.
The plan to give the advanced 
graduate work had its, origin in the 
belief on the part of Carnegie of
ficials that there is an acute need 
for a more comprehensive study of 
the science, of metals, tha: theoreti
cal knowledge .has lagged far be
hind the demands , of industry.
In planning the courses the in
stitution feels that it is furnishing 
to candidates for the Doctors de
gree an excellent opportunity for 
study. A competent teaching staff 
and .the alreadyexisting equipment 
of the institution will furnish the
oretical Icnowledg: while t'.c Pitts
burgh district, the heart of the steel 
industry, will provide an adequate 
field for practical : tudy. Particular 
attention will be given to studies ot 
special steels ab . which knowledge 
is now lacking. As the courses de
velop it is proposed that the stu
dents will be given the opportunity 
to study various mills tlia't make 
special products.
The course of study has been out
lined by Dr. V. N. Krivobok of the 
Bureau of Metallurgical Research, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, and 
includes such courses as' Advanced 
Metallurgy of Iron and Steel, Cor
rosion of Metals, Advanced X-Ray 
Analysis, Advanced Electrochemistry 
and Electrometallurgy, Advanced Eco
nomic Metallurgy, Plan Problems, 
Refractories, Physical Chemistry of 
Iron and Steel Making, Metallurgical 
Design, and Advanced Testing of

Queer Antics Of 
Bewilder
Surveyors 
Maggie Niurphs
Of coursc, as Maggie Murphs, 
we of the paid-for sex are ex
pected to live up to all ye ancient 
and honorable customs by asking 
all possible questions at all times, 
whether opportune, or no. And 
since this seemingly prerequisite 
characteristic must be in evidence 
before the questioned ones will be
lieve that we arc a true representa
tive of bur sex the following reverie 
will have an adequate defense, in 
the face of our. profound ignorance. 
So, now that all other minor diffi
culties have been disposed of, such 
as the hugely satisfying turkey, 
with its ensuing regrets and reso
lutions galore as to temperance in 
all things, we venture to state our 
query.
It concerns those individuals who 
periodically sprinkle the camps. 
They are perfectly normal in out
ward appearance, though one is 
weighed down with some sort of 
absurdity that strongly resembles 
a camera which has been defaced 
by the fell marks of time, and dis
rupted, by undue exposure to faces 
of questionable pulchritude. The 
second member of this queer com
bination is also apparently healthy 
of body, but we doubt that his 
mind is in this enviable condition, 
for he carries a long wooden stick 
with regular markings on its sur
face, resembling a gigantic ruler 
out for an airing!- 
Although they do not' often ex
emplify that famous after-dinner 
speech beginning I am monarcli,, 
of all I survey, technically these 
odd soiils arc called ' surveyors, 
and they proudly amble across the 
sward handling theirshall we call

Three Game Series
The Tartan Baskcteers opened 
the official schedule by defeating 
the Youngstown Y quintet at 
Youngstown, December 27, 33-30. 
And the score indicates just how 
hard the rivals fought for the 
laurels. The Y passers pressed 
the collegians closcly all through 
the .game and the form of the Tar
tans presages one of the most 
successful lloor seasons for Car
negie in the past/couple of seasons 
when only the mediocre teams re
presented the Skibos in basketball.
Coach Hogan has molded to
gether a team which is certain to 
make its presence felt incol&giate 
basket ball this winter. At least 
that is the impression formed as 
the Tartans exhibited fine teamwork.
Ncasc and Webster were the 
outstanding stars for the Carnegie 
five while Grcnncn and Herman 
were the top scorers for the Y. 
Herman caged six field goals and 
two fouls and Grcnncn contributed 
three goals from the field and four 
from the free line.
Webster was the most prominent 
point getter for. the Skibos, being 
responsible for one-third of Car
negies markers. He made five 
field goals and one foul. Nease 
caged live two-pointers and-a fotfl 
for a total of seven. Lcnard was 
also a factor in Carnegie's victory 
with three ficid goals. Lineup:

Mr. Beatty Talks 
On Employment 
To Senior Groups
On Thursday, December 12, John
D. Beatty, head of the Bureau of 
Recommendations, spoke to three 
groups of seniors in the Colleges 
of Industries and Engineering con
cerning employment upon gradua
tion. This subject is one in which 
every senior who is graduating will 
be vitally interested.
Mr. Beattys talks were of a very 
informal nature, and dealt largely 
with the procedure to be used in 
lining up seniors for interviews 
with the many companies which 
visit Carnegie Tech every year. He 
stressed the fact that the bureau 
cannot obtain positions for those 
who apply for aid, but acts sim
ply as a broket, finding out -what 
the employers needs are, and then 
passing on this information to those 
who appear capable of filling these 
needs.
Another point especially stressed 
was  that of making a favorable 
impression, upon interviewers. This 
impression depends to a great ex
tent on neatness, of dress, rtjanners, 
and personality. On the informa
tion sheets which Mr. ' Beatty dis
tributed there arc some valuable 
hints which the seniors will do well 
to look over. It is very advisable 
for the prospective graduate to 
take stock of himself now and 
then and attempt to build up that 
part of his make-up which is weak.
The senior can make a good start 
towards obtaining the kind of work 
he desires by filling in the Em
ployment Information and Per
sonal History blanks which he rcccived as quickly as possible and 
returning them immediately either 
to his department head or direct 
to Mr. Grau in the Bureau of Rec
ommendations. Many companies 
use these as a source of informa
tion, and it is therefore important

These early season victories are especially pleasing when 
one recalls the games of other years. They help considerably

EVEN THOUGH THE FOOTBALL SEASON is now 
far behind us, wc just cant help mentioning a few things about 
those Coast games. First of all, the predictions of a certain 
columnist of a certain rival schools weekly paper have gone 
askew, if you know what wc mean. It seems as if this gentle
man predicted an 18-6 victory for his team over Southern Cali 
fornja and even went so far as to compose some poetry. Lets 
all read it:
On the sunny Western Coast 
Some Trojans are in for a roast,
If your little Campus Scout 
Knows what hes talking about.
Now well say, as a certain phonograph record has said, 
Lovely. A little sour, but lovely just the same.
Now, readers, wc shall try our hand:

The Panther team, with all its boast,
Failed to win.

Among the, questions considered 
informally at this meeting was the 
purpose of an' alumni chapter. The 
duration of active membership in 
Alpha Chi Alpha is. so short that 
need isfelt for some organization 
to hold together the alumni mem
bers and connect them with the 
work ,of ,the active chapter. The 
concensus of opinion seemed to be 
that about four meetings a year 
of the alumni chapter with the 
possibility of combined meetings 
with the active chapter would bo 
most desirable. October, Decem
ber, April and June, were suggested 
for the meetings, but definite dates, 
were not decided upon.
It was decided to hold another 
Meeting as soon as more definite 
material could be collected from 
Alpha Chi Alpha national head
quarters and from the active chap
ter. At this meeting election of 
officers will probably take place 
and a report on possible meeting 
places will be made. A schedule of meetings will be offered for con
sideration by the alumni and a 
program of work will be offered. 
Notices of this meeting will be 
sent out to alumni residing at a 
distance as well as to those of the 
immediate Pittsburgh district.
The temporary officers chosen at 
the meeting on December 29 were 
Ellen or T allmadge, M'27, chairman^ 
and Josephine Clark, M28, secre

were Anne Kirker Bowser, M24:

make it a successful party, and

To Hold Tea Jan. 11
The Alumnae of' Margaret Mor

Senior Class at a NewYears Tea 
on Saturday, - January 11-,' - from 3 
to 6 p. m. .The Alumnae Tea, an 
annual affair, will be held in the 
"Rec Hall this year instead of in 
the Practice House as before. Mar
garet Harrison Napier (14) is 
chairman of the Executive Committce.
iiHLETICSfSEDtR
The life-saving class, composed of 
I' women, has progressed with ad
mirable rapidity. Practically all the 
more difficult teststhe approaches 
and brca!.shave been practiced. Al
though the class is .ther far ad
vanced, any earnest swimmer can 
enter the class now and by hard 
work catch up to the others. The 
practice periods are every Tuesday 
at 4:30..
Final life-saving tests will again 
be given at the Carnegie pool under 
the direction of a Carnegie swim 
tiling instructor. This arrangement
'will be more satis factor3r to the 
candidates than the one formed at 
the beginning of the year that com
pelled the woman to pass her tests 
at the University of Pittsburgh.
The senior life-saver who wishes 
to become an examiner will still, as 
far as is known at the present time, 
have to go lo the University of 
Pittsburgh to pass the required tests.
Honoraries
There is a marked tendency in 
the field of women's athletics to 
abolish point systems. Some of the 
first-class colleges have already 
done. so. Although Carnegie be
lieves that her point system is 
indispensable at .preserft, a new 
honorary system has been adopted 
as an attempt to encourage women 
to play for the sake of the fun 
and experience of the game rather 
than for the points it offers, and 
also to encourage indifferent play
ers to increase their skill.
The women who arc chosen by 
a special committee, composed of 
a gym instructor, the manager of 
the sport, and a Board member, 
will be called honoraries of that 
sport. As the recognition is purely 
honorary, the player docs not re
ceive any athletic points.
This new system is one of the 
direct results of the report given 
by the Carnegie representative at 
the sectional conferencc of the A. 
C., A. C. W., held in North Caro
lina last May. The idea of, a num
ber of women who were selected 
only-for their skill in a certain
spoi't. to form a special honor group 
w' adopted at the June confer-; 
egce of the Carnegie W'. A. A.
Board.- Just recently the sugges
tion has been acted upon and is
now a part of the constitution.
Just how this new plan will 
work out is yet to be jcen. The 
Board is looking forward with 
interest and curiosity to the end
of the winter sports season when 
the first "Honoraries" will be, se
lected.
Basket Ball
Now is the time to start that 
basket ball practice that youve 
been promising "yourself to. attend. 
After a long, lazy vacation you 
should be anxious to get into your 
gymn clothes and ^ork off all those 
pounds of chocolates so lavishly 
consumed in the past few weeks. 
A brisk half hour in a basket ball 
game and a cold shower three' 
times a week will give you. a 
delicious feeling ' of freshness and 
will put you in good condition to 
pass those examinations that are 
not far off. Aside from the benefit 
to your physical appearance and 
mental set there is your duty to 
your class; You are needed to 
support your team. Also, you 
should want to make the basket 
ball honorary position.
Bef6re Christmas recess attend
ance at the practices was very en
couraging, and Harriet Hanna, the 
manager, Iiqjjs that they will be 
supported even still better now 
that the season has begun in 
earnest. A practice period wa* 
held last Thursday and Friday and 
tlife third one will be this after
noon at 4:30.
Harriet requests that those wom
en who can do so should make 
use of the 3:30 period on Tuesday, 
at which Miss Porter has kindly 
offered to conduct. This arrange
ment will prevent overcrowding of 
the gym and will give all girls, 
a chance to play longer.
Once more, you freshman women, 
are asked to come out and support 
your team. The season has really 
only begun and the. tournament 
will not be played until the end 
of February. Freshmen, dont let 
the sophomores beat you!
Rifle
The rifle manager Wishes to re-: 
mind the beginners that a Begin
ners Match will be scheduled soon. 
As no definite plans have been 
made the 'beginners should watch 
the bulletins for any announcement 
of the match. At the end of the 
rifle season a loving cup will be 
awarded to the winner. Elinor 
Kutchka, a M. M. Sophomore, won 
the cup last year.

Report on December 
Meeting of Night 
Student Council
The two vacancics in the Plaid 
staff whicht existed on account of 
the failure to register on the part 
of A. M. Kirchner, in the College 
of Industries, and C. R. Carnivale, 
in the College of Fine. Arts, upon 
reccommcndation, Averc filled by 
the following appointments:
J. S. Geyser, the present associ
ate news editor in Industries to be 
news editor, assuming the place 
of A. M. Kirchner. David E. 
South to fill the place of associate 
news editor of Industries. Edward 
DcLorenzo to be associate news 
editor of Fine Arts, to fill vacan
cy made by C. R. Carnivales failure to return.
These three students arc not 
new to the night college publica
tions, as all have been contributors 
in various capacities. No change 
in policy of the Plaid will be oecasoned by this change in staff. 
Wc havebeen endeavoring to sup
ply the night students with inter
esting news items as it concerns 
our group and hope we have met 
this need. Any night student may 
contribute articles for this page. 
In sending material wc would re
quest that you sign 3rour name, 
and also give us your address. 
This would expedite matters a 
great deal.
Well, here we are, back again at 
the old stand, after our two long 
weeks of restdid you say ease 
I thought I got you wrong. It 
was just about as busy a time as 
I have ever had, and I dont mean 
maybe. Between all the parties, 
dances, socials and what-nots, Ill 
say I had a busy time. And as to 
studying, -well, that could wait un
til I got back to school again; why 
bother about this trivial question 
when so much else took ones time 
up? The Profs, should have known 
better, anyhow.
I have been casting my eyes 
around to see if anything new es
caped my notice, as I had expect
ed some additions would be made. 
You know, I had sorta expected 
that there would be a possibility 
that the Stop and Go light 
ivould make its appearance at the 
Cut, but alas, no such good luck. 
Honestly, this sure would help out 
a great deal. I dont see why the 
city did not put one here long ago. 
I suppose we will have to wait un
til a half-a-million students are 
killed before we will get this safe
ty. Isn't that a beautiful thought 
--lets rest upon it.
I did notice, however, that a 
wire had been strung across the 
path worn near Engineering Hall, 
and a sign please posted there. 
I have often see students taking 
this cut to the, upper entrance of 
Engineering. Ha'll, and sometimes 
wondered why none of them fell 
down the cut. If for no other 
reason than safety they should re
frain from using this path, as dur
ing the wet weather the grade here 
is such that if you once started 
to slip, it would be Slide, Kelly, 
slide. Of course, this reason is 
only a minor one, as wc should 
take the aesthetic side of our 
"Campus into consideration, and 
try to let the few blades of grass 
which might spring up, flourish 
and thereby beautify the surroundings.
I am wondering what the com
mittee has for the post holiday 
dance which is scheduled for Janu
ary 1-1 (I almost said 1929), 1930. 
Its so hard to write the new year, 
we are so used to the old one, 
and maybe the good times, too. I 
still have in mind the Thanksgiv
ing recess dance, and will say that 
the committee certainly did give us 
a _ good party. I am going to be 
on hand for this affair, and would 
recommend all night students to 
do likewise.
At the December meeting, of the 
Night Student Council, the follow
ing questions were discussed:
The status of the Plaid, third 
page of the Tartan. E. E. McDon
ald, editor, was present and gave 
a report on the question as it now 
stands. Meeting had been arrang
ed between Prof. Leighou, repre
senting the administration; Mr 
Lippert, editor of Tartan, and him
self, and conditions gone over 
thoroughly. Assurance was given 
that our contract would be fulfill
ed. Approval was given to new 
appointments on the Plaid staff to 
fill vacancies existing on account 
of A. M. Kirchner, and C. R. Car
nivale not returning to Night Col
lege this fall. J. S. Geyser was 
appointed to succeed Kirchner as 
news editor; D. E. South to fill 
Geysers place as Associate news 
editor in Industries, and DeLorenzo to assume place left vacant 
by Carnivale in Arts.
Reports that the Thanksgiving 
recess dance of Night Student 
Council, and Night College of Fine 
Arts dance were successes.
Stop and go traffic light installa
tion at Morcwood avenue and 
Forbes street was discussed, and, 
the Council was in favor of the 
administration taking this question 
up with the city authorities. This 
is a dangerous intersection, and 
some steps should be taken to cor
rect this evil. General parking 
conditions were also discussed, 
particularly at Machinery Hall.
Night Thistle staff appointments 
were made, which were Henry E. 
Mauro, night editor, and David E 
South, night business manager.
Aircraft, Aviation Engines, Instru
ments and Navigation. The fee is 
$18, payable at registration. The 
second division is sheduled from 
February 10 to March 14. The 
fee, including the first course, is 
$36. The supplementary division 
scheduled from March 17 to April 
21, is listed at $54, and includes 
the admission to the first two 
courses.
Applicants for admission to the 
Ground School Course should make 
formal application for admission 
and secure . a personal interview 
Application blanks and further in
formation may be obtained at the 
Registrars Office. The Ground 
School course will be repeated at 
a later date if there is sufficient 
demands for enrollment.
A special course for licensed 
pilots of any grade, consisting of 
instruction' in' Aircraft Instruments, 
Navigation and Meteorology, is 
also offered to a limited number 
of candidates. The course is sched
uled on Monday evenings for the 
period January 3 to April 21. The 
fee payable at registration, is $18, 
and includes 40 hours of instruction.
The above is a view of the finished Shelter Pavilion erected at the termination of the Cut at Morewood Avenue and Forbes Street. Dr. Baker advised The Night Student Council that the Board of Trustees had defrayed the cost of erecting this shelter, and that the amount do
nated by the night students would apply tOAvards the erection of the Student Activities Building.In securing Colleys orchestra 
the social committee of the Night 
Student . Council certainly made a 
wise move for its next dance, the 
post holiday dance. This dance is 
to be held in the auditorium of 
the men's gymnasium, on January 
11, 1930.
After divulging this information 
they were reticent in giving any 
more particulars. in regards to 
what they have to offer. T aking 
the past experiences into consider
ation, however, we will have not
ing to wonder at if this affair does 
out-class previous ones. We know 
the ability of the social committee, 
and they are not going to disap
point us.
Tickets are now on sale every 
evening by members of this com
mittee, and also other night stu
dents who are interested in making 
our social functions the successes 
they are. The price of admission 
is only $1 per couple, but what 
you get for this small fee more 
than justifies any effort which you 
may have to make to attend. No 
other social functions on the cam
pus can equal what the night stu
dents get at these dances. Our ad
vise to you is purchase your ticket, 
date the girl, or fellow, if co:cd, 
and be present on the night of 
January 11, starting at 9 o'clock.
NIGHT ENGINEERS 
BANQUET
Final Report on Kiltie 
Band Uniform Campaign
The annual banquet of the Night 
Engineers was held on Saturday, 
Dec. 21, in the English room of 
the Fort Pitt hotel. There were 
more than two hundred present, a 
record crowd for this affair. An 
excellent dinner was served and 
aftci the boys had had their fill 
they sought other fields to conquer 
In the proverbial Carnegie style they 
took to the air but instead of foot
balls, small rubber balloons were the 
weapons used. The air in these ballouns seemed to 1;, heavily laden 
with moisture, the bombardment last
ed for about fifteen minutes until a 
halt was called by Toastmaster Smith, 
after which hostilities ccascd.
At this time Mr. Smith formally 
introduced the guests of the evening. 
Professor Lcig-. .u, who wa's the first 
to arise gave a brief talk explaining 
his duties as Associate Director of 
the night courses.  Dr. Ihrig was 
calted upon next and lie took this 
occasion to announce several changes 
which will certainly be welcomed by 
the night students of the Engineer
ing school.' G. T. Pcttay and W. A. 
Miller, ' two members of the old 
guards were also called on and both
vc very interesting talks. All the 
speeches .were short and snappy and 
were well received by those present;
After, fhe speaking' program was 
c mpletcd there was a short recess 
before the entertainment was present 
ed. Margy, who Had Keen billed as 
mistrefes .ofij ceremonies, was unable 
to be present due to illniss. Mi^s 
Ann Caruso served in her place and 
did an excellent job of it. The 
program of entertainment lasted two 
hours and was very pleasing the 
vholc way through.
The officers of the school are to 
be congratulated for the success ol 
this affair. They worked very hard 
for it and proved that with some 
co-operation they can put things over 
in fine shape. M.
The result of a campaign conducted 
last year by the Night Student Coun
cil lo secure additional Kilts for the 
Kiltie Band was very gratifying. 
Contributions came in on :  sides, 
and below is a list of the personal

sufficient to purchase two more new 
uniforms, making a total of seven 
uniforms which the Night Students 
have given to this Carnegie Campus 
Group.
In closing up this campaign I take, 
this occasion to thank all those who

to come to the bureau and speak 
to Mr. Beatty or Mr. Grau con
cerning any phases 'of employment 
upon which they may have ques
tions. The greatest co-operation

The Bureau of Recommendations 
announces that its offices will be 
open Monday and Thursday eve
nings from 6:30 to 8:30, replacing 
the old hours of 7 to 9. This 
change has been made because it 
is believed the new hours will, be 
more convenient for the majority 
of students. Most classes begin at 
7:30, which, under the old hours, 
left only a half hour to t^ke care 
of a great number of students.
With the new year it is hoped 
that all the night students may be. 
satisfactorily placed, and the Bu
reau is making every effort to 
place the men who have been un
employed. Mr. Grau asks that all 
men who are at present out of 
work come into the office and file 
an application, so that they may 
be considered for openings which 
occur from time to time.

Atheistic Students
Doomed to eternal damnation are the Carnegie students, or 
at least some eighty-five per cent of themmay their souls be 
heat-proof. They iiave been stripped of the last vestiges of 
holiness, exposed in their degrcdation, those who have plunged 
head first into the glittering cup of frivolity or merely inserted 
a tentative toe in the heady bubbles, for the church has dis
covered that only fifteen per cent of the Carnegie Student Body 
attends church. The remaining eighty-five per cent are ignominiously classed as atheists, thereby showing the meagre 
chance they have of successfully passing the proverbial needle's 
,cye.
Several months ago, a Carnegie man, on being pressed by a 
local pastor, hazarded a guess .that about fifteen per cent of^ the 
Carnegie students attended Sunday worship. With no investiga
tion and less consideration, the pastor seized up the revelation 
elaborated a little and publicly added another link in the long 
chain of damnation against youth in general arid collcgiatcs in 
particular. It was picked up by the Pittsburgh papers, then 
the syndicates and country-wide echoes have been returning 
in the form of press clippings with Marked Spread of Atheism" 
as a typical heading. They contain statements such as ... . 
<fdo not attend church, or attend only occasionally, because of 
insufficient home training, heavy dates on Saturday nights, or 
the failure of ministers to reconcile religion with the science 
the students arc taught. College men and women throughout 
[the country are abandoning religion.
This fact accurately portrays* the present day ecclesiastical 
attempt to fathom and combat the insinuating doubts and ques
tioning disbeliefs so typical of students, exposed as they arc to 
the works of unprejudiced thinkers, works which have, only 
within the last few years, been published without fear of godly 
inquisitions and religious persecutions. While the partisans of 
rill the churches herald from the house tops that the supreme 
want of the world (and youth) is religion, they completely 
ignore the fact that youth may not care to accept the orthodox 
views in their trite and myopic forms. Perhaps students have 
discovered inconsistencies and have lost faith in the older tenets 
only to construct a new, individualistic religion to put in its 
place. Satisfied with their inventions, they take their beliefs 
for granted and usually disdain even contrasting it with other 
forms of belief. The student body is neither a Faust nor a 
Marguerite, but merely represents a problem which is the logi
cal outgrowth of education. Because youth docs not adhere to 
the dogmas and superstitious morals of the church, there is 
little justification to class them as atheists. Such an accusation 
Is an eighteenth century hang over /bringing to mind conditions 
which would have doomed students, holding present-day views, 
to eternal smouldering i,n the lowest pils.
Ruskin once declared, Our national religion is the per
formance of Church ceremonies and preaching of sporific truths 
(or untruths) to keep the mob quietly at work while we amuse 
ourselves. And as late as II80'J Leo XIII summed up what, Up 
to that time and even down to the present, has been the theory 
of Protestants and not alone the Catholics. Labor is the pain
ful expiation of sin, the rich and poor arc ordained by nature 
to maintain the equilibrium of tire body politic. Cod, then as 
now, is to be feared, worshipped, praised, bcsccchcd and obeyed. 
We do as He wills when we attend the ceremonies prescribed 
by the particular church to which we belong. Certain forms 
of sacrifice, fasting and penitence, are deemed pleasing to God 
and necessary to the saving of the soul. It is a Christians duty 
to adhere to the straight and narrow way of salvation, pre
scribed by the New Testament, through belief in their Savior. 
.They are commanded to love their neighbors as themselves and 
neighbors, of course, arc those who hold the one and only true 
faith. All these, the salient features of religion in Christian 
lands, have undergone a critical surveyance not to pick flaws 
in. the original foundation, but to expose the building, marked 
with hurried remodelings, and held up by a decaying and sadly 
inefficient framework.
It becomes more evident, as universal education increases, 
that Emile de Lavelaye, the Belgian economist, was correct 
when he stated, If Christianity were to be taught and under
stood conformably to the spirit of its Founder, the existing so
cial organism could not last a day. The tortured and oppressed 
of past ages, as well as those of today (the world is not the 
universally prosperous and. happy sphere many people state it 
is'), have beseeched the sponsors of religion for deliverance. 
What is intelligent, loving, tolerant and humane in the present 
social structure, has come from the lips and pens of men and 
women who rejected religious dogmas, braved death and con
demnation and overrode superstitious morals.
Roman Catholics tenaciously insist upon rites and dogmas, 
paralyzing minds and always tending toward stupidity; while 
Protestants, claiming to be more advanced, tend to virtue. 
Catholics would like to imprison birth controllers and Protes
tants attempt suppression of anything smacking of free love 
or "free thought.  Not that these modern views arc necessarily 
constructive, but it is clearly evident that the churches continue 
their age old policy of condoning and absorbing when they can 
no longer safely persecute and destroy the new morals and be
liefs which govern successive ages in their, slow, and religiously 
contended, climb to economic and moral freedom. Such action 
Is conspicuous at present in the activities of the Church for. 
guaranteed peace. The public, sickened by war, demanded peace 
and the Church took up the cry with voices which had also 
cried for war during the years of international hate.
_ Is it? any wonder then that the Church can never win the 
entire confidence of the poor, or students who think on the sub
ject? It is always on the side ,ol the rich and powered, in 
times of crisis or conflict, no matter what it professes to believe 
or disbelieve. It protects and. sanctions economic institutions, 
moral falacies and political inadequacies, which all further the 
suppression and unhappiness of many of those which it pro
fesses to help. With promises of immense and inexpensive hap
piness in another world for the unfortunate, they religiously 
ignore the conditions which make those unfortunates. A per
son on the ragged edge financially, buffeted by labor squalls 
and economic vicissitudes would much prefer a mitigation of 
I his present physical condition before any attempts arc. made to 
purify and cleanse his soul for a futurelife * L.
After "two weeks spent in enjoy
ing the privileges and pleasures 
which come annually with the visit 
of Mr. Claus, we arc now back ai 
it again, thinking only of hard 
work and examinations  among 
other things. Lots of things hap
pened during vacation; yes, lots of 
things. In the first place Sig Holvcrstott's Inter-Collegiate Brawl, 
pardon, we mean Ball, was quite a 
ucccss, although the entire crowd 
s still . wondering what became of 
the much-heralded Pletchcr Hen
derson. If the vandals had left 
the big Christmas tree alone, how
ever, things might have been much 
nicer. Lots of people we know 
were there, too, including the ever
present President of Theta Tati. 
Even the Gccp was on hand.
Annually the' Christmas season' is 
responsible for several things, 
Neckties which can never be worn, 
gloves that never fit,. Christmas 
cards that weren't anticipated, and 
the usual depletion of mens fur
nishings by the students who had 
been hired to work in our large 
department stores.
From all accounts our own foot
ball team had a wonderful vaca
tion, Last weeks Sun-Tele con
tained an article by Jock Suther
land in which he stated that his 
Golden Panther outfit were not 
tourists but football players. Since 
our boys stopped . in Chicago and 
again in the Grand Canyon for no 
other reason than a little sight 
seeing, it looks like the honorable 
Scot was giving a slight dig to 
ward' someone. Now we honestly 
hoped for a Pitt victory last week, 
but from what happened in the 
Rose Bowl on New Years Day, 
maybe a little sight-seeing doesnt 
hurt after all. But to return to 
the Carnegie team. A vacation is 
a vacation at anytime,.but imagine 
a vacation in which one might play 
croquet with Anita Page. They 
say that thats all our All-Ameriv. 
can Armcntrout did in Los Ange
les. In addition, Betty Bronson 
took a liking to the curly-haired 
commercial. Not so bad I Some of 
the. boys:-found the seas between 
the mainland and Catalina Island 
a little rough, but there were no 
uprisings. We understand, too, that 
Manager "Dodo Wright received 
quite a kick as he watched the 
Indians dance for him in Arizona. 
And Bert Munhall had quite. a 
time in Frisco, we hear. But why 
two or three of the boys went to 
Tia Juana is still a mystery which 
will probably never be solved. All 
in all, the boys had quite a time.
Anyway, vacations arc vacations, 
with girls home from Wellesley 
and boys going to Denver, we all 
had quitea time.

Late' last Tuesday, about12 p. m., 
1929 ended and 19.30 began. So 
wed like to make a few predic
tions for the New Year, and we'll 
bet were right. In the first place, 
we predict, that, if we make any 
remarks about the editor, they will 
be .censored. Next, we wont have 
any Campus Week. There wont 
be any fraternity politics in the 
spring calls and elections  not 
much. In addition, we predict that 
the Junior Prom Committee wont 
have un orchestra, for, at least two 
weeks, that Dave-Tomer may smile 
once nr twice in I he next year, 
that the Puppet will make money 
and the Tartan may or may not, 
probably, not; that plobe regula
tions will soon he a thing of the 
past, that we find out who Cardo 
Thistledown is before the year is 
up, and that we win our bet with 
Hoy Sample. We arc taking an 
awful chance, but if the above 
predictions come true, Mr. Babson 
had.better look to his laurels.

Random shots and random 
thoughts. Isabel Levin wants her 
name in publication and we are 
always glad to oblige. Maybe some 
of the boys that jumped on Wally 
Steffen when lie said 'Notre Dame 
13, Pitt 6, wont hark so much 
now. Wonder how the Campus 
Scout feels. The girls who worked 
on Tri-Pub dont get any student 
directories. They arc all gone. 
One of the Student Councils as
sistant  secretaries is engaged, and 
we hope the habits catching. We 
wonder who the boys and girls-in 
formal dress at the Pitt-Ohio State 
game were. Looked like Roxic and 
his gang. And a Happy New 
Year to.all!

again to close with a rush and top 
the Tartans, 39-29. Sensational 
goaling by Truehart Taylor, sub
stitute forward, and Sophomore 
Eddie Cubbon, after a relapse in the 
Mountaineer defensive, pulled the 
game in for the West Virginians.
The Mountaineers led at halftime, 18-10, but neither . theynor 
the Plaid showed much during that 
period. Tech started rallying im
mediately after the second half 
opened and gradually moved iip on 
the Mountaineers until with only 
eight minutes gone they held the 
lead for the first time, 24-22, through

Boston has done it again. This 
time a perfectly respectable Cam
bridge bookseller has been sentenced 
to' a month in jail and has been 
fined $500 in addition for selling a 
book alleged to be immoral, Lady 
Chattcrlys Lover, by D. 1-1. 
Lawrence.- The book was not ex
posed for sale nor was anybody 
solicited to purchase it. An agent 
of that disgusting organization known 
as the FIR England Watch aiid^ 
Ward Society procured the commis
sion of the crime by going into the 
shop and begging the bookseller to 
get him a copy. This time the society 
has at least received from both the 
prosecution and the defense the dres
sing down that its despicable methods 
deserve. r The district attorney says 
that' lie wishes 'the public to under
stand that lie indorses neither the 
policy nor the tactics of the society 
and lie adds that '.f its agents go into 
stores of good repute and induce 
people to commit crime he will pro
ceed against them. He should be
gin right now by making an example 
of the contemptible agent who figured 
in this case. The counsel for the de
fense, .-Herbert Parker, who has held 
high' office in the Stale and stands 
well at the bar, properly declared:.
These miserable; false pretenders 
who pose brazenly as protectors of 
public morals are nothing but falsi
fiers and deceivers. God forbidthat 
(he standards of this Commonwealth 
should be stained by the false and 
poisonous hands of such pcrsonsl
What is the matter with' Boston 
that this society is not put out of 
business, by the contcmpt of the 
citizenry?

 "They arc Simply Small Files in 
which human being arc stored 
awaythus Colonel George F. 
Chandler; who has just investigated 
Auburn  'Prison at the request of 
Governor Roosevelt, describes the 
horrible cells in th:  prison. They 
are, he declares, "antiquated, damp, 
dark, and cold, and - devoid of all 
sanitary conveniences except pails. 
They are seven feet highand seven 
deep; half are four feet, wide and 
half only three and one-half fectr 
in' these two men arc often immured. 
The prisoners are "poorly and in
adequately clothed; there are few 
gloves, overcoats, or boots for those 
who work oiit-of-doors. The prison 
itielf was built-in 1816 -and has rjot 
been added to since 1SS0.  In addi
tion to all this, the men have for 
months been without adequate work 
or any work at all, without athletics
or any proper exercise. Is it sur
prising that victims of this kind of 
"reform have twice .within six 
months risen in desperation? Colonel 
Chandler is able to praise only the 
womens -wing which has 115 in
matesaiid three babies I He recom
mends immediate . relief from over
crowding even by the use of the State 
Fair Grounds, an increase in the 
number of guards and civilian em
ployees, better food, the abolition of 
special privileges, - the segregation of 
incorrigible, prisoners, and the aboli
tion of ;tlie Mutual Welfare League. 
The Governor has accepted ; four of 
theserecommendations: , relief; from 
overcrowding, better food and cloth
ing, . anda mow prison-guard,. .system. 
\Yc are glad that -ho will not abolish 
the League. It is not less, but more 
self-government that the prisoners 
need.* * * *
At the end of seven months' strug
gle to organize, the strikers toll is 
six men and one woman killed, 
twenty-four Wounded, seven sen
tenced to prison for five to twenty 
years, seven kidnapped, and five 
(logged by mobs. Not a single one 
of those responsible for the violence 
againstthe strikers has been brought 
to justice.- 
The case of the Textile Workers 
against the State of North Carolina 
stands as above, according to the 
American Civil Liberties Union. 
The lit deputies lately on trial 
for second-degree murder for the 
death of six textileworkers . have 
just been acquitted by a moun
taineer jury in Burnsville, North 
Carolina. The strikers were shot 
in the back; not one of them, ac
cording to eye witnesses, carried a 
gun; the deputies used their guns 
to disperse acrowd in front 
of one of the mills at Marion. 
Their plea was self-defense 
against an old man, James Jonas, 
now dead, who, after the sheriff 
had thrown tear-gasbombs into 
the crowd, began to lay about him 
with his cane, against two or three 
hundred unarmed workers who had 
shown no disposition to violence 
and even wheh they were shot at 
had only a desire to get away.- 
The verdict was not a surprise to 
spectators in the courtroom, nor 
will it be to anyone who has fol
lowed the mill trials so far. The 
State always wins; the strikers and 
organizers always lose. But the 
State may rest assured that, while 
labor conditions in the South re
main what they are, the bloody 
struggle will not end.The Nation.

scored only two goals from close

Mountaineer team working smothly, compared witli its miserable ex
hibition Thursday night against 
Nebraska in the opener. Capt.

HON. H. R. WILBUR
(Continued from Page One) Association, will be the presiding 
officer, and Mrs. William Thaw, 
Jr., vice president of the Associa
tion for Western Pennsylvania, 
will be chairman.
Elaborate plans have been made 
for the entertainment of Dr. and 
Mrs. Wilbur during their short 
visit in Pittsburgh. The days 
schedule for Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur 
includes a lunchcon at the DiiV 
quesne Club at 1 oclock, given by 
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, president 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy, in honor of Dr. Wilbur; a 
lunchcon at the home of Mrs. 
Franklin C. Irish, 1074 Devon road, 
a board member of the Public 
Charities Association, in honor of 
Mrs. Wilbur, and a dinner at the 
Pittsburgh Golf Club at 6:30 
oclock at which local board mem
bers will be hosts to Dr. and Mrs, 
Wilbur, and to board members of 
the Association from other parts 
of the state. A committee of 
prominent Pittsburghers is in 
charge of the arrangements for the 
entertainment of. Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur.
Dr. Wilbur was formerly presi
dent of the American Medical , As
sociation and of Leland Stanford 
University. He was also Presi
dent Hoovers right hand man dur
ing the days of the World war, 
when the President acted as food 
administrator. Besides being an 
eminent educator and a distin
guished public official, Secretary 
Wilbur is a rarely gifted orator 
and an excellent publicspeaker.
A most cordial invitation is ex
tended to the public. No reserva
tions or tickets arc required; for 
this reason ft is advisable to come early.

ter and in the imprint that is left 
on everything "imported is its 
creative power.
The great achievement of the 
American Theater, however, is not 
merely this flare and readiness to 
buy up all that Europe has to of
fer. In the stamp which America 
puts on all her imports is hidden 
her own creative power. It is all 
the stronger because while bring
ing to her soil everything of talent 
gathered everywhere, America dom
inates these imports and crushes 
them by her own Americanism. 
America has enough creative pow
er to apply to original contribu
tions. These contributions may 
not be evident to the majority of 
the Americans themselves, but they 
are evident to me, the foreigner 
who has come from the U. S. S. 
R. to demonstrate the achieve
ments of the -Russian theatrical 
revolution to New York.
In art, the evolutionary process 
is at least as beneficial as the rev
olutionary. The evolution of the 
world records the revolutionary 
leaps of every country,  and gives 
them credit even before the coun
try undergoing the - revolution has 
time to register them itself. The 
American Theater is in contact 
with the. Revolutionary Theater, as 
f it had radio waves across the 
ocean. TheAmerican Theater is a 
product of centuries of organic 
growth, of customs; tacitly accepted 
for generations. The art laws de
creed by Revolution are in direct 
opposition to the accepted stand
ards, and frequently have nothing 
in common , with them. Hence the 
achievements of the Russian Revo
lutionary Theater are striking and 
noticeable, even against the grain, 
whereas the originality of the 
American Theater and its slow, 
and organic growth has little in 
it to cpalcr le bourgeois, even 
though the principles underlying 
its growth arc practically the same

It would not require much of an 
effort to prqve that such American 
institutions as the Circus, the 
Vaudeville and the Movies arc 
based on tendencies that, while 
indubitably having an eye on boxoffice receipts, are not merely as 
Europeans claim, catering to the 
bestial instincts of the average 
moron. They arc but one mani
festation of the optimistic Ameri
can Renaissance. Box receipt poli
cy could hardiy account for the 
tremendous influence the American 
Theater now wields over Europe.

Here we have the exhibition of 
all that is extraordinary and origi
nal; and only then comes the 
standardization of life in accord
ance with the given example. Upon 
these standards life draws for para
gons. Individuality here is su
preme-it is the model for the
ob. Here it is the theater that 
takes the first step in reorganizing 
life and -arouses in the spectator 
the desire to be better, to improve 
himself, to be master. The act, 
the activity of the cultured person
ality is contagious only when evi
dent, even as the appetite rises in 
us when we cat.
Hence the new American prin
ciple of the Theater which has 
been prevailing for the last ten 
years in the Revolutionary Theater 
in U. S. S. R. can be formulated 
succinctly in these, words: all ar
tistic productions in their rigid 
form should find their resting place 
in museums; the place of the 
theater is in. its very act, in crea
tive and ever changing exhibition. 
The old Moyra is dead, and in its 
stead America has placed the new 
Moyrathe Goddess of Optimism, 
the primal source of energy,- faith 
in life, work and the dollar, and 
regulating the capitalist anarchy of 
production, also etlie source of the 
great American Theater.
