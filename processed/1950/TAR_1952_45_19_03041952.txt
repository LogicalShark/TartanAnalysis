For Annual Sing Competition
Al Hartman To Play For Saturday Dance;
Eighteen Groups Plan To Participate In Sing
Always one, of the highlights of the school year is the fraternity-sorority Greek Sing and Swing which will be held March 7 
and March 8 respectively.
The Sing will begin at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Music Hall and will 
consist of the singing of two songs * ---------------------------------
by each fraternity and sorority. 
One of these songs must come 
from a special list prepared by a 
eommittee of music school faculty. 
The choice of the second song is 
entirely optional to the group, but 
no song may be repeated by the 
same group unless a three year in
terval has elapsed. The groups 
will sing a capella, and must 
plete its program of 
six minutes from 
the first song to 
the last song, 
for pitches only.
Minimum of Sixteen
Each fraternity is required to 
have a minimum of 16 singers or 
one-third of their membership, 
whichever is the larger, 
shall have a minimum of 
participants. (The leader is a par
ticipant.) Eligibility as a partici
pant is open to all active 
pledges, social members, and 
uate students who belong to the 
organization and are attending 
CIT this year.
Judging of the contest will be 
by three impartial persons who 
have no affiliation with fraternities 
or sororities represented on the

from the Mens Dorm Council. The 
nominees, however, must be CIT 
undergraduate day students, which 
includes fifth-year music and ar
chitecture students; and they must 
not have been King of Hearts can
didates.
Posters may not be displayed 
before 7 a.m., Monday, March 31; 
and no campaigning except that of 
posters, ten alloted each candidate, 
will be allowed until after 7 a.m. 
on Tuesday, April 1. There are re

Large Deficit 
The proportionately higher in
crease in MMCC tuition is to bring 
into line certain cost inequities 
which have gradually developed 
between MMCC and the other col
leges. Also, while many endowed 
professorships and special funds 
are available to E&S in meeting 
costs, MMCC has few special en
dowments at its disposal.

First Semester Freshmen Rule 
Thrown Out By SC Amendment
Bob Byrnes constitutional amendment to permit first-semester 
freshmen to serve on Student Council was passed with but one dis
senting vote in Council meeting last Wednesday. The amendment 
would change the wording in Art. II, Sec. 11(a) fiom In all col
leges the representatives . . . shall*
be at least second-semester fresh
men at the time of election to 
shall be at least first-semes
ter freshmen ...
Counter-Proposal 
In supporting this change, Byrne 
stated, Council is supposed to be 
a representative body, and I be
lieve that it should represent all 
four classes.
Dick Franklin added, I believe 
that the spirit and fire of freshmen 
would be an asset to Council. 
Don Hand offered a counter-pro
posal that would establish a posi
tion of a non-voting representative 
for the freshman class. Dick 
Christensen, though not a member 
of Council, was permitted to speak 
and opposed this plan on the 
ground that freshmen would still 
have no effective representation in 
SC. The freshman class already
has one non-voting member of 
Council m its class president. 
Christensen also emphasized that 
freshmen can make a contribution 
to campus government and only 
ask for the opportunity to do so.
Social Foul-Up 
Council had quite a time wrest
ling with the problem of conflict
ing activities scheduled for April 
19. It seems that Cameron Choir 
had filled out a petition for that 
date for their spring concert last 
December, but that, through a 
mix-up in the Deans office, the 
petition was not presented to the 
social chairman until last week. 
Thus, Cameron thought that the 
date had been reserved for them as 
an all-school function and that no 
conflicting events would be sched[Continued on page 6]
by Carnegies anticipated deficit 
of $285,000 for the current year, 
which may be greater next year in 
spite of a possible $200,000 addi
tional income from the tuition in
crease.
Values of scholarships granted 
to students will advance in pro
portion to the raise. At present, 
Carnegie students hold scholar
ships worth $129,000 for the cur
rent year.
Less Than Half 
Dr. Warner explained that a 
recent institution-wide survey at 
Carnegie Tech shows that tuition 
provides for less than half of the 
cost of instruction (actually 
45.5%). The remainder of the 
funds necessary for the operation 
of the school comes from the Car
negie and other endowment funds, 
special grants, and endowed pro
fessorships. These latter scources 
provide a relatively constant 
amount per year, Which means 
that the added funds needed in an 
inflationary period must come 
largely from tuition increases.
The Boss Speaks 
Said Dr. Warner: Income from 
endowment has not kept pace with 
rising costs, and a raise in tuition 
and in the amount of gifts to the 
school is the only means of main
taining top quality education and 
research.
The last tuition boost for the 
Colleges of Engineering and Sci
ence and Fine Arts was in 1948 
when the fee went up $50 a year. 
Margaret Morrison had a $20 a 
year increase in 1950.
Sweepstakes
All groups interested in en
tering the Spring Carnival 
sweepstakes competition are 
requested to meet at 4:30 this 
Thursday in the Union.
Lucky Boys!
Figures recently released by 
the government show that 
there are about 350,000 men in 
college who will feel the cold 
breath of the draft shortly.
On January 1, 1952, there 
were 1,258,735 male college 
students between the ages of 
18^4 and 26. The selective 
service status of these stu
dents was as follows:
With I-S deferments.. 11,857 
With II-S deferments. .209,710 
Deferred ROTC
students ......................263,000
Deferred veterans ....377,503 
Deferred divinity
students ...................... 28,930
Total deferred .............891,000
This total deferred figure 
subtracted from the total of 
male college students shows a 
remainder of 367,735 men po
tentially in the draft pool, but 
many of these cannot be in
ducted into the service be
cause they are members of the 
National Guard or organized 
Reserves, and approximately 
40 per cent of the remainder 
will probably fail to meet the 
minimum physical and mental 
standards.

Safety Doesnt Pay
At a recent meeting of the National Council for the 
Social Studies a resolution was passed to the effect that the 
unrestricted study of controversial issues, both political and 
economic, including the doctrines of communism, is essential 
to education in a free democracy. Most citizenseducators, 
politicians, and Joe Doaksagree with the principal in
volved. But in the real world of real happenings these 
supposed champions of intellectual freedom are prone to 
toss aside high principals for the temporary security afforded 
by narrow conservatism.
The present struggle between capitalism and commun
ism is a struggle of ideologiesas such, it is essential that 
every student, every housewife, every worker know the aims 
and achievements, if any, of communism if they are to 
know its fallacies and learn to appreciate democracy. As 
Dr. J. A. Burkhart, professor of American Civilization at 
Stevens College, Columbia, Mo., declared recently, democ
racy cannot be taught or practiced on the basis of conformi
ty, orthodoxy, or a policy of playing it safe. Democracy 
must continually raise new banners, chart new goals and 
solve old problems. It cannot allow communism to cham
pion cause which lie in the rightful domain of democracy.
But the policy of playing it safe, damaging as it is, 
has become more and more the fashion in recent years. 
The current waves of loyalty oaths (which accomplish noth
ing, since anyone plotting to overthrow the government 
would gladly sign such an affirmation), textbook supervision 
by outside groups, and the examples of legislative investi
gations into faculty fidelity cast a dark shadow across the 
classroom, which closely resembles the witch-hunts and bookburnings of other societies. If there are errors in our social, 
economic, or political systems, they should be exposed so 
that corrective measures can be applied. What better birth
place for enlightened citizens than the classroom?
Our legislators should be taken to task for passing loy
alty oaths to please the loud lobbiests of the American Le
gion. Educators should be chastized for narrow actions 
against faculty and students who, guilty of no proven crime, 
may have views which differ from those of the majority 
(witness the recent suspension of a Wayne University coed 
for having opinions inconsistent with the obligations of 
responsible university citizenship.) But most of all the 
fault lies with the great mass of college students themselves 
who, not being exposed in the classroom to differing eco
nomic and political ideologies, are too lazy to learn any
thing on their own.
Suppose we picture a .setting: a small dwelling in Bur
ma, Greece, India, or Italy: A family which has known for 
the most part only hunger, cold, insecurity, and the ravages 
of war. On the one hand we have a student of a communistdominated country, filled with the zeal of conversion and 
bursting with arguments, facts, figures, and examples show
ing the faults of capitalism, and holding out the shiny promise 
of ideal communism. On the other hand we have the allto-typical American student who doesnt even know the 
difference between communism and socialism, and who 
long ago decided that all economic and soc-rel courses were 
for the birds. Who do you think would win the argu
ment and gain another friendly sympathizer?
We have a big advantage: we are free to learn about 
communism objectively, largely free of the false coloring 
given to the study of capitalism in the communist countries. 
If those who control the universities are afraid to do any
thing but stick their heads in the sands of isolation, then 
the students must learn to think out and decide issues for 
themselves. This is one case where safety doesnt pay!

Resolution.
Spirit of Education
The colleges and universities 
cooperating in the co-sponsorship, 
with the Federal Union, Inc., of 
the model conventions do not nec
essarily do so because they en
dorse all aspects of a federal union 
of the democracies, but rather be
cause they wish to open their fa
cilities in the spirit of education 
to a serious and scholarly inquiry 
into the idea as a means of fur
thering international cooperation 
and security.
Also the student delegates who 
participate in these conventions do 
not necessarily do so because they 
are supporters of the Union idea, 
but rather they wish to give it 
their serious attention and eval
uation, to discuss its merits and 
short-comings, and to satisfy 
themselves in the company of 
their collegiate contemporaries 
that there may be more than one 
way to alleviate international ten
sions.
Delegates from CIT
In the Model Convention to be 
held at PCW, student delegates se
lected by faculty committees from 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
Carnegie Tech, Mt. Mercy and Duquesne University will take part 
in the discussions. The delegates 
from CIT are Dr. Edward Sterling 
and Catherine Larocca.

With political feelings "waxing 
hotter every day, the inquiring 
reporter decided that a few terse 
student opinions might cast a 
little light on how college students 
feel about the coming presidential 
race.
Fred Ryan, Sophomore Physics.
I think that 
K e f a u v e r 
should be Pres
ident. By a pro
cess of elimina
tion, all the 
other candi
dates have too 
many faults for 
me to see them 
in that office.
[ think that 
Eisenhower has the popularity to 
win, however.
Ralph D. McNatt, Senior M.E.
Lets change 
a d m inistrations 
and vote fear 
Taft. He al
ways confirms 
the fact that 
ever ything is 
being done 
wrong. We 
could put him
in the executive 
office and write 
letters denouncing his actions for a 
while. Of course well have to 
elect him for an eight-year period. 
According to all his speeches, itll 
take at least that long to accom
plish everything that he has 
promised. However, Harry will
winthe peons and ward-heelers 
will machine this one.
Sanford Pollock, Freshman Ar
chitect. Eisen
howers a good 
man for the 
Presidency  as
for the others, I  mi
dont want Taft, 
there are better 
men than Kef a u v e r, and
Harry is my 
last choice. As; 
for the outcome, 
its a tossup between Eisenhower 
and Truman.
John Deahl, Freshman Physics.
The next Presi
dent should be 
General MacArthur. He** 
one of the few 
national figures 
in recent years 
who is a states
man and not a 
politic ian. I 
dont think Mac 
is campaigning 
enough, and my speculation is that 
Eisenhower will win.
Irene Hezlep, Retailing Junior.
I think Eisen
hower s h o uld 
be P r e sident.
Hes the only 
candidate who 
has both Amer
ican and fore i g n support.
Conditions are 
so u n c e r tain 
right now, and 
politics so 
changeable that I really dont 
know who will win.

One Tear For Poor Rossignol 
New S'nS Production Manager
Want a job thats all work, a little fun, but makes one feel 
that hes lost all his friends? Then take the job of production mana
ger for Scotch n Soda. The poor soul who is trying to tie Good 
Heavens together this year is Ken Rossignol, a senior dramat whos
been with the club for the pastfour years.
This business of losing friends 
stems from the important task as
signed Ken this year; trying to 
make a theater out of the Gym. 
Although hed worked out the 
plans along with the school to cre
ate a theater that will eliminate 
all the previous difficulties of 
Scotch n Soda, people still ask him 
if hes crazy for staging a musical 
on a basketball court. Until he 
and the theater prove their worth
this spring, hell probably still feel 
like a man without a country.
Although Ken is a daramtics 
student, he never acts; but his 
branch (production major) keeps 
him back stage handling such de
tails as the lighting for The Corn 
Is Green and the sound for 
Hamlet.

ASEE Affirms 
Serious US
Engineer Lag
A critical shortage of engineers 
faces this country and its defense 
effort according to a report re
leased today by Richard W. 
Schmelzer, chairman, public re
lations committee of the American 
Society for Engineering Education.
Both industry and the armed 
services have a current need rang
ing from 60,000 to 90,000 engi
neers but only 28,000 engineering 
students are expected to graduate 
in 1952.
This report was based on a sur
vey of engineering schools and col
leges made in October 1951 under 
the joint sponsorship of the United 
States Office of Education and the 
American Society for Engineering 
Education.
Enrollment of freshmen engi
neering students in September 
1951 showed an increase of 16.2 
per cent over 1950. However, in
dustry and the armed services will 
not have a chance to benefit by 
this increase until four years 
hence. Since may of the 1952 grad
uates have been granted defer
ments to complete their college 
courses, defense industry is likely 
to find itself with a deficit of from 
40,000 to 70,000 engineers, Mr 
Schmelzer stated.

CaseP Wash-Jeff, EdinboroP Slippery RockP 
Allegheny Complete Competitive Meet Order
Before a capacity crowd in the Skibo Pool, a well-balanced 
Carnegie swimming team scored a smashing victory Saturday after
noon and retained the Penn-Ohio championship for the second
consecutive year. +------------------------.---------------------------------
A 60 point total for the Tartans 
gave them a 14 point edge over 
their nearest competitors, the Ti
tans from Westminster. Following 
the Titans were Case, Wash-Jeff, 
and Edinboro. The Allegheny and 
Slippery Rock teams were tied for 
sixth place.
Six New Records 
With competition keen in each 
event, the meet featured six rec
ord-breaking performances. The 
Tartans set three of them to cop 
team honors, while individual 
honors went to Frank Matter of 
Case as he lowered times for both 
220 and 440-yard free style events.
Dick Kramer was Carnegies 
only double winner of the day as 
he won the 150 yard individual 
medley and anchored the winning 
300-medley relay. In the individ
ual medley Kramer clipped more 
than 8 seconds from the old rec
ord held by Bob Weddell; in the 
medley relay he teamed with Bob 
Coulter and Bill Aiken to set an
other new record for the Plaids 
outstanding performance.
Track!
Guy Halferty, Carnegie 
track coach, urges all men 
who are interested in partici
pating in intercollegiate track 
competition for this year to 
contact him any afternoon at 
4:30 in the athletic office.
The track team is particu
larly in need of aspirants for 
positions in the quarter mile, 
hurdles, and high-jump 
events.

by more than five seconds.
Bob Hart, lucky half of W&Js 
Hart brother combination, clipped 
fractions from his specialty, the 
220 yard backstroke, in the only 
other record of the day. His un
lucky brother, John, narrowly 
missed setting another record in 
the breaststroke.
Tartans Take Four Firsts
Of the total ten events the Plaid 
managed to place first in four and 
second in three. In addition to the 
wins of Kramer, Demas, and the 
medley of Bob Coulter, Bill 
Aiken and Kramer, Grey Dun
can continued his superiority in 
the diving with a gold medal. The 
440 free style relay team of Tom 
Astle, Chuck Gough, Demas, and 
Kramer took second place in the 
final event while Coulter and De
mas picked up the other seconds in 
the back stroke and free style.
SPLASH!
Members of the Tartan swimming team celebrated their victory 
in the Penn-Ohio Championships last Saturday by throwing Coach 
Claude Sofield into the middle of the pool. No lifeguards were needed 
as Coach Sofield swam out under his own power.
Hoopsters Upset Titans 77-71 
For Thirteenth Season Triumph
Tom Beck Leads Tartan Scoring Parade; 
Plaid Set For 2nd Winning Year Since 1938
Carnegie cagers stormed through to a 77-71 upset victory over 
Westminster College last Saturday at New Wilmington in a hard 
fought revenge of their 66-65 defeat suffered earlier in the season
in the Skibo gym. ?---------------------------------------------------------
Except for one first quarter 
deadlock, 5-5, the home team trail
ed during the entire game. The 
Tartans got off to a good 18-12 
first period lead and through fast 
breaking and excellent ball hand
ling managed to increase the mar
gin to 35-24 at the intermission.
Almost Tied 
Poor play in the early minutes 
of the third period allowed the 
Titans to outscore the Plaid 22- 
12. They almost tied the game for 
the second time at 47-46 before a 
succession of field goals by Tom 
Craig, and free throws by Hilary 
Holste and Tom Beck put the 
Plaid further ahead, 51-46, at the 
end of the period.
With less than three minutes re
maining in the final quarter, the 
Tartans were cushioned with a 10 
point margin that carried them to 
the final gun.
One Game Remaining 
It was the last game of the sea
son for the Titans and ended a six 
game winning streak. They sport a 
season record of 15-7. In leading 
the Plaid hoopsters to their thir
teenth win in twenty-two starts,
Tom Beck collected 22 points on
10 field goals and 2 free throws.
Tom Craig and Kaye Thompson 
shared second place scoring hon
ors with 17 markers apiece, and 
Hilary Holste added 10 points for 
fourth place.
With one game remaining to be 
played at Grove City, the Plaids
13-9 won-lost record includes a
73-53 lopsided win over Indiana 
last Wednesday.
Plaid Pulls Ahead 
The Plaid sharpshooters trailed 
17-13 at the close of the first per
iod, but outscored the Teachers 
19-11 in the second quarter to gain 
command at half-time 32-28. It 
was a Tartan game from then on 
as the Carnegie cagers outscored
the home team 15-9 and 26-16 in 
the final two periods.
Morgan and Gurski led the In
diana scorers with 15 and 9 
points respectively while Holste 
with 19 and Craig with 18 topped 
the Tartan listing.
13-9 Record 
Tom Craig, currently leading 
the Tartan scoring, has amassed 
a point total of 381 points during 
the 22 games so far for a game 
average of 17 points.
The 13-9 record now held by 
Coach Mel Cratsleys 51-52 edi
tion of Carnegies basketball team 
is even with the mark of his 49-50 
team which accomplished the first 
winning season the Plaid had had 
since 1938. A win over Grove City 
would push the won-lost record 
for this year to 14-9.
Varsity Track 
Men To Begin 
Practice Sessions
Coach Guy Halfertys cindermen 
are again preparing to don their 
running togs in anticipation of the 
coming track season. The Tartan 
track and field men will have to 
work hard to equal the record set 
last year. The Plaid harriers com
pleted their schedule undefeated.
Although the services of star 
hurdler Connie Hammond will be 
missed, the squad will be bolster
ed by the return of sprinters 
Johnny Luchok, Fritz Wilson, and 
distance and field men Chuck 
Bateman, Dave Douglas, Bob Core
man, John Cooper, and Maurice 
Taylor.
Coach Halferty is earnestly 
searching for a few promising men 
to fill vacancies in the hurdles, 
quarter-mile, and high jump slots.
At least once every sports staff, or every year, athletic 
policy at Carnegie Institute of Technology comes in for re
view on the Tartan sports pages. Not being ones to break tra
dition and with the belief some constructive criticism is due, 
we would like to take one of our last opportunities to present 
the following opinions for the student body and administra
tion to mull over.
First on the list is a gripe about the secrecy policy con
cerning the appointment of a new Tartan athletic director. Al
though it has been common knowledge for some time that Buddy 
Overend, present athletic director, is due for automatic age re
tirement at the end of this year, no information has been per
mitted to leak out about who is being considered as his suc
cessor. In fact, at present, no one will comment on the selec
tion process or who is doing the selecting. Students at other 
universities, including Pitt and Penn State, actively influence the 
appointment of athletic officials; students at Carnegie dont even 
know how they are appointed.
Athletic Survey Needed
The second suggestion to be put forward concerns an 
evaluation of the athletic programincluding both varsity 
and intramural sportsin relation to programs of other lead
ing colleges. Carnegie prides itself on being one of the top 
universities in the nation, and it would be both interesting 
and informative to compare our athletic program with those 
of institutions such as Cal Tech, MIT, Chicago, Harvard, and 
Yale. It is the frank opinion of this column that any uni
versity wishing to maintain an outstanding position must 
cempete not only educationally, but also athletically. Whether 
by means of an outstanding intramural program, a wide 
range of intercollegiate sports, or an exceptional team in 
some one intercollegiate sport, a top-grade institution must 
offer athletic as well as educational facilities on a par with 
its competitors. .
Currently, Carnegie is the recipient of favorable national 
publicity on its educational program. Athletically, however, it 
doesnt merit a favorable press release outside of Pittsburgh. 
The nationwide sports attention CIT recently received was of a 
backhanded variety and probably aroused more ill will than 
admiration. Carnegie wont receive positive publicity on ath
letics until it can point with pride to its athletics. If CIT has an 
outstanding sports program, we would like to see the results 
of a survey so we could talk about them.
Big Time Basketball
The final idea we would present concerns more em
phasis on basketball. Conservatives will immediately yell 
Robert E. Doherty, but we submit Mr. Doherty never offi* 
cially de-emphasized sports. He emphasized education. Ath
letics and education are not mutually exclusive classes 
a view held long ago by Mr. Plato which bears reiteration. 
If anyone is against good education and good athletics, let 
him speak up.
Looking at facts, a nationally ranked basketball team at 
Carnegie is not an impossibility; what is more important, it 
can be achieved without a sacrifice of principle. Now the present 
Tartan hoopsters, under the able direction of Mel Cratsley, have 
marked up a 13-9 record for a schedule including Pitt, West
minster, W&J, and Penn Stateone step from the big time. On 
the Plaid squad are only three holders of Steffen scholarships. 
With a total of 18 Steffen scholarships this year involving alumni 
contributions of $10,900, 15 are on the football team. The ques
tion arises, what would be the result of a more equitable dis
tribution of scholarships between football and basketball?

Structure & Function 
Of The Carnegie Plan
By Dick Durstine
Fight for the glory of Carnegie,
Fight for the glory of the Plan..
.. .Anon
When we, as innocent and unsuspecting freshmen, first arrived 
at this noble institution to take up our books, slide rules, T-squares, 
paint brushes, and scripts, we came face to face with a formidable 
creature know only as the Carnegie Plan. For a period of one
week we were subjected to lec- ?---------------------------------------------------------
tures and literature skillfully de
signed to properly confuse us, and 
then were sent out into the world 
to face engineering, science, the 
Ai ts, and above all, the Plan.
Review of Principals 
By now the most of us have be
come thoroughly hardened to the 
rigors of a Carnegie education. We 
know when we are likely to run 
up against the Plan, and approxi
mately what to do when it appears.
It may be beneficial, however, 
to review the principals of the 
Plan, and the means of creating an 
immunity to it. Let us concentrate 
on the one great stronghold of the 
system, the social relations course, 
or SocRel.
Here is indeed an exotic beast. 
It is the final barrier to our ulti
mate oozing into the set and rigid 
mould of the engineer or artist. We 
have one last hurdle to go over be
fore we become a mere problem 
solving machine or walking 
camera.
Of course, the alleged purpose 
of the SocRel course is to prevent 
this final conformity with the 
mould, to give the Carnegie stu
dent some resemblance to a hu
man being when he finally comes 
forth from his cocoon, and flies off 
into the world.
Fuel for Industry *
One look at the populace here 
will shatter all hopes in this di
rection. One might just as well 
try to stop the flow of a stream 
of molten steel with a piece of 
filter paper as to attempt to alter 
the course of the vast mass of 
protoplasm that flows through the 
halls of CIT, being cast into fuel 
for the wheels of industry.
So since we are headed in this 
direction, and must clear the last 
obstacle prior to our goal, we may 
as well do it effectively and effiCARNCG1E PIAN
ably in vague generalities. The 
good student can give forth twice 
this much volume before saying 
anything at all.
2. Never say yes or no; no word 
stronger than possibly should be 
used. Above all, never be definite 
about anything.
3. Dont let your mind become 
cluttered by facts. If forced to 
use them, make sure they are ob
scure and irrelevant.
4. This above all, use reserve 
books in the library. Use them for 
anything you wish. Just remem
ber, grades are based to a great ex
tent on the librarys circulation 
records.

Rules of the Game
1. Never answer a question in

[Continued from page 3]
(1) must be a selective service 
registrant who intends to request 
deferment as a student; (2) must 
be satisfactorily pursuing a full

Consideration for deferment as 
a student is either a score of 70 or 
better on the Selective Service 
College Qualification Test or a 
class standing among the male 
members in the upper half of the 
freshmen class, upper thirds of the 
sophomore class or upper threefourths of the junior class. Sen

of 75 or better.
70 Explained 
Students already enrolled in grad
uate schools may be considered for 
deferment as long as they remain 
in good standing.

Student Council[Continued from page 1]
uled. Meanwhile, Council was in
the dark about the whole situation.
To further complicate matters, 
two fraternities, Sigma Nu and 
Kappa Sigma, thinking that April 
19 was an open date, went ahead 
with plans for spring formals for 
that evening. To compromise the 
conflict, Dick Durstine moved that 
the concert be approved for April 
19, but that it not be considered 
an all-school function. Although 
there were some misgivings in 
Council at the prospect of having 
to sustain any loss incurred by the 
concert, the motion was passed.
By-Law Adjustments
Council then approved the Kap
pa Sig closed formal for April 19, 
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon formal 
for March 29, and the Kappa Sig 
invitational formal, also for March 
29. It was announced that Sigma 
Nu had been able to change the 
date of their formal.
Certain changes in the by-laws, 
which have been pending action 
for some time, were also acted 
upon. Among them were the fol
lowing:
1) Organizations needing the 
service of APO for permanent dec
orations should apply for it at 
least four weeks in advance. Fail
ure to comply with the above can 
result in suspension of the organ
izations budget at the discretion 
of Council.
Crew Call

25 in conjuction with CFP was 
also passed.
Mortar Boards budget for their 
annual King of Hearts Ball was 
approved, with the estimated profit 
to be put in a scholarship fund for

Student Council 
Reports $41 Loss 
On Recent Dance
The regular monthly meeting of 
the Evening Student Council was 
held at Carnegie Union on Sun
day, March 2. Social Chairman Bill 
Bartoli reported a $41.62 loss on 
the Gay Nineties dance. It was 
agreed that those that attended 
seemed to enjoy themselves. A 
great amount of work was put into 
advertising and decorating, so the 
attendance was attributed to the 
usual lack of interest for social 
events by the student body.
Kenneth Pore, an active work
er for Council, was elected as a 
member at this meeting.
Engineering Banquet Chairman, 
Don Walker, reported that pro
gress was being made on the 
event. He extended a call for all 
Evening students interested in 
earning points toward an Insignia 
Award. Workers are needed for 
typing letters soliciting souvenirs 
from industrial concerns.

Newman Club 
Will Organize 
Friday, March 7
As mentioned in last weeks 
Plaid, the Carnegie Union will be 
the scene for the function of a 
Night School chapter of the New
man Club, on Friday, March 7. 
This meeting is open to all Catho
lic Evening Students. The time of 
the meeting is set for 10:30 p.m. 
and will last but a short while. 
This meeting was purposely 
scheduled for this late hour due 
to the fact that many students are 
in class until 10:20. On hand to 
explain the activities of this or
ganization will be Marilyn 
Sweeney, president of CITs day 
school Newman Club.

A long needed face lifting is 
finally occurring in the Chemistry 
Lab Room 214. The stock room, 
long a jumbled mass of assorted 
bottles and glassware, is being 
torn out. It will be replaced by a 
modern more easily serviced room. 
Due credit must go to the stock
room attendants who have man
aged to give such efficient service 
despite difficult working condi
tions.
It is hoped that provision for 
coat hooks will be made while the 
Chemistry Lab is being renovated. 
It is deplorable that the students 
must place their coats on acid en
crusted lab tables.
Engineering Banquet Chairman 
Don Walker is certainly having 
trouble keeping a co-chairman. 
Will Schnarrenberger, Vic Sabol, 
and Byron May have all resigned. 
The job of interviewing the enter
tainment must be a difficult one! 
Guy Martinelli has graciously of
fered his services. Wonder how 
long he will last?

In a cigarette, taste 
makes the difference, 
and Luckies taste better!
The difference between just smoking and 
really enjoying your smoke is the taste of a 
cigarette. You can taste the difference in the 
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a 
Lucky ... for two important reasons. First, 
L.S./M.F.T.Lucky Strike means fine tobacco 
.. fine, mild tobacco that tastes better. Second, 
Luckies are made to taste better... proved bestmade of all five principal brands. So reach for a 
Lucky. Enjoy the cigarette that tastes better!
