Honorary 
To Tutor 
This Week
Tau Beta Pi Plan 
Includes Courses 
In Technical Fiel
Tau Beta Pi is opening its pro
gram of free tutoring this week. It 
has long been a tradition for Tau 
Beta Pi to conduct such tutoring 
classes, but this year the scope of 
the program has been greatly ex
panded.
In this program Tau Beta Pi se
lects capable undergraduates from 
its own members. and from other 
honor and professional societies to 
conduct the classes. It is the aim 
of these classes to help all of the 
underclassmen 'Who are having 
scholastic difficulties in their fun
damental English and Science 
courses, and are willing to put 
some effort into their work. It is 
hoped that this, tutoring will, pro
vide the underclassmen with an 
opportunity to eleminate some of 
their difficulties.
Tau Beta Pi does not intend to 
supplant regular channels -of as
sistance available to students 
it hopes to suppliment them by 
giving the student seeking help a 
chance to get it informally.
It is also hoped that a series of 
slide rule lectures will soon be 
given with the assistance of Pi Mu 
Epsilon and the Math department. 
These lectures will be designed to 
teach the students a little more 
about the use of the slide rule.
For further information about 
tutoring refer to the schedule ap
pearing on the last page of the 
Tartan. Then watch for additions 
or changes in future issues. A 
regular schedule will be printed 
each* \veek.

Book Review 
To Be Given 
In Assembly
Former CIT Professor 
Writes Religious Study
Dr. Max Schoen, former head 
of the psychology department, will 
review his book, The Man Jesus 
Was, at the assembly on Tuesday, 
October 19, at 11:30 a.m.
After he retired from Carnegie in 
1948, Dr. Schoen lectured a year 
at Dartmouth college and has 
spent two years as lecturer at 
Hamilton college in New York. His 
reputation as an interesting'speaker made his classes the most pop
ular among the students.
Dr. Schoen is recognized in the 
United. States, not only as an out
standing writer, but also as a re
searcher in the field of aesthetics, 
ethics, and religion. He has writ
ten several religious books.
He came to Carnegie in 1921 as 
an. assistant professor and four 
years later became a full profes
sor. In 1937 he was appointed as 
head of the department of psychol
ogy and education.
Council Powerless To Control 
Homecoming Celebrations
Horsch Resigns To Simplify Technicalities;
Class Organization Reports More Progress
Giving *up his status as Carnegies first Student Council repre
sentative from the graduate school, Bob Horsch resigned last Wed
nesday in order to simplify matters.
Councilmen found themselves powerless in trying to'handle 
Homecoming functions, since the*
administration has scheduled 
everything, including an offcampus dance on Saturday.
Could Stay Ou 
Horsch tendered his resignation 
on the condition that he have 
charge of the new public address 
system in the gym, which was his 
main responsibility as chairman 
of Councils permanent decora
tions committee. Although it is 
possible to find technicalities in 
the organizations setup that 
Would allow certain graduate stu
dents to be Council members, he 
felt the present situation would 
be simplified through his action.
New Council 
Class organization committee 
chairman Dolly Mitchell reported 
further progress in the forming 
of a general council of class offi
cers. The group will consist of 
the president of each class, a 
chairman .from Couhcil,. and two.- 
other student members. Capel 
McCutcheon and Don Baeder were 
chosen to help with this project. ,
The main function of the new 
group will be to unite the various 
class organizations. Junior class 
president Wes Apple expressed 
confidence in the plan. Dick Ro
man, sophomore prexy, was not 
present at the meeting. Apple re
ceived permission to fill by ap
pointment the vacancy in the Fine 
Arts vice-presidency.
The meeting closed following a 
discussion concerning Smollens 
proposal that ID cards be made 
transferable tickets to all games. 
The issue was let ride pending 
further investigation and consul
tation with.the athletic committee.
Since Homecoming this , year 
will be tied in with the inaugura,tion of President Warner, the cost 
of practically the entire event will 
be supported by the school. The 
student dance will be held Sat
urday, October 28, at the William 
Penn hotel following an alumni 
banquet there. Admission will be 
$2.50 of which $2.00 will go to 
the school The remainder, from

Three Way Celebration 
Highlights Homecoming
Semi-Formal Planned Off Campus I 
But Price is Lowest In History j
The biggest Homecoming celebration in Carnegies history is 
well on its way to becoming a reality as student committees it* 
charge of various events during the three-day celebration begin to?formulate their plans.
32 Countries
Represented 
At Carnegie
Latest figures from the Regis
trars office show 32 foreign coun
tries are represented at Carnegie 
Tech this year. The International 
club has greeted the students from 
these countries with two social 
gatherings to date and many more 
planned.
The International club is an or
ganization designed primarily to 
give foreign students an active so
cial program, but it is open to all 
interested students from the Unit
ed States as well. Thus it enables 
students from the variouse coun
tries to become acquainted with 
each other as well as with the 
countries of other people.
Besides their activities with the 
International club, the foreign stu
dents will also be entertained at 
many private' homes. If any of the 
faculty would -like to entertain 
some of these students, please no
tify Mr. Rollin V. Davis, Box 124, 
CIT or to Nancy Sitler, 2354 Bensonia Ave., Pittsburgh 16.
The countries represented are 
listed as follows: Argentina, Aus
tria, Brazil, Canada, China, Co
lumbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Domin
ican Republic, San Salvador,

Sweden, Switzerland. Thailand, 
and Venezuela.
Activities
The names of all officers of 
campus organizations and ac
tivities should be turned into 
the-Dean of Student's office as 
soon as possible in order to be 
included in the Activities Di

Candidates For Queen 
To Be Chosen Soon
Freshmen women from nine departments wilL meet next week 
to select their nominees for Homecoming Queen. The system of se

dorm residents, initiated last year, succeeded in providing a better 
representation of freshman wo-*------------------------:---------------------------------
men.
The number of candidates to 
be chosen from each department 
was decided by the percentile 
system. The  largest freshman 
class, home economics, has three, 
and all others have one with the 
exception of general science, so
cial work, and architecture, which 
will only have* one candidate for 
the three departments.
The all-school election, at 
which both men and, women may 
vote, will be held on Tuesday, 
October 24. The nominations and
election is being conducted by 
Cwens, sophomore womens hon

A Duty And A Privilege
Two weeks from today, freshmen will be called upon 
to elect their class officers for the coming year. Two years 
ago, class organization was non-exisent on Carnegies cam
pus. Two years ago, also, school spirit was practically non- ! 
existent at CIT. Freshmen were allowed to drift aimlessly j 
into school and departmental affiliations that segregated them 
from the rest of their classmates.
The re-iniiiation of class organization at Carnegie, less 
than two years ago, was brought about as a possible solution to. 
the general apathy of both the students body and the alumni.
It was hoped that separate class organizations and officers would 
 serve not only to stimulate school spirit and class consciousness, 
but also to increase interest and activity among future alumni [
groups. j
Much time has been spent in developing and perfect
ing the class organization program since it was first pro
posed. In return, all that is asked of freshmen is coopera
tion. Cooperation in three waysin the nomination stage,1 
at the polls, and after their representatives-take office. j
 If you feel that one of your classmates has the necessary !
abilities to make a good class leader, organize a group and push I
 the nomination and election of this person. Petitions are now j
available in the Dean of Students office, and must be returned |
with the required signatures by Friday of this week. ;
The purpose for which class organization is set up, and 
the benefits it offersboth to the group and the individual 
makes it a dtuy and a privilege for every freshman to sup
port the coming elections all the way.
In Rebuttal
The Poor Physicist who wrote the letter in last weeks 
Tartan, showing concern over the evident absence of the 
student body in plans for celebrating this years three-way 
homecoming program, may rest at ease.
The only explanation to the seemingly-apparent absence of 
students from this years fall carnival is that student committees 
have just begun to formulate their plans, and publicity in the 
Tartan is just covnnioiK-iiig with this issue. On the other hand, 
administrative and alumni committees had all summer to work 
. out their plans.
However, in future issues, student plans will be out
lined as the biggest fall celebration in Carnegies history, for 
both students and alumni, begins to take shape. On the front 
page of this issue, the student committees set up for the 
handling of the students part at homecoming are listed.
A Good Follow-Through
A Little Louder, Please!
We sat in amazement at last Saturdays game and watch
ed and listened to the pitiful Tartan cheering section. Cer
tainly, we thought, there are enough in attendance at this 
game to supply more vocal backing to the footballs team 
attack.
The cheerleaders, although they could stand more practice, 
were also present in abundance. However, there seemed to be 
no unity among the various sections in the stands, and little if 
any cooperation with the cheer leaders.
Weve heard many suggestions as to what is neded to 
remedy this situation: get better cheers, get one cheerleader 
with a portable loudspeaker, and make all the freshmen sit 
together.
The second suggestion struck us as being the most practical. 
One cheerleader who could be heard above the entire chorus 
of nine cheerleaders would get far better results than the present 
system.
We would like to see this system in use for one Satur
day. Equip the head cheerleader with a portable loudspeaker 
and give everyone in the stands a chance to follow the cheer
ing before it is half completed.

1 Student Blasts 
j FPHA Dorms
! Editor, the Tartan:
I As a student now living in the 
FPHA barracks, 1 was greatly in
terested by the article in last 
weeks paper describing the ex
pensive construction program re
cently completed at Morewood 
Gardens. Why is it that the school 
administration is willing to spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
provide luxurious lounge areas 
and interdorm telephones for the 
women students instead of using 
this money to provide decent ac
comodations for the male dorm 
students?
The barracks are deadly fire 
traps: I.have heard the statement 
that it would take only seven min
utes for the whole structure to be
come a raging holocaust. The 
walls between the rooms are pa
per thin, and we run the con
tinual risk of putting our fist into 
our neighbors race. At some ends 
of the barracks there are no steps, I 
only vertical wooden ladders. I
The thin walls are totally inef- ! 
fective in holding down the noise 
level of the dormthus making it 
doubly hard to concentrate on, 
ones studies. If you decide to give \ 
up and seek a little relaxation in 
the recreation room, you again 
draw a blank, for the facilities, if 
you can call them that, are in a 
sad, sad way.
Its hard enough to get heat in 
the winter time; but once you do 
get it, you are liable to sweat and 
swear, for there are no means of 
heat control in individual rooms. 
There is hot water in only one 
out of every two wash bowls, and 
the shower facilities are almost as 
bad as in the Army.
I have waited patiently for some 
indignant outburst from one of our 
highly touted campus leaders or 
from one of those organizations 
unselfishly devoted to the welfare 
of the students; but since most of 
these entities seem to be more con
cerned with the phrasing of some 
obscure line in some equally ob
scure constitution, I thought I had 
better do it myself.
Not that I expect anything to be 
actually done about the problem 
by any campus organization, but at 
least Student Council can form a 
committee which can write a re
port about the problem which can. 
then be filed away like Wes Ken
neys Skibo project. I
Sincerely yours,
The Gleep.

PLAID MAD . . . The Tartan team 
did not wear their sharp new 
football uniforms of white and 
plaid last Saturday because Davis 
& Elkins didnt get their road uni
forms in time for the game. Since 
both teams cannot wear the same 
colors, our football players must 
wait until this Saturday to sport 
their plaid and white uniforms. 
THE GOOD OLD DAYS . . . When 
the staff members of WRCT were 
cleaning up the Union basement, 
where the stations studio is lo
cated, they took out heating venti
lators that had not been used since 
the school acquired Carnegie 
Union. And guess what they found 
wedged behind those ventilators? 
It was a scoreboard from a Car

those days are gone forever.

edy, Goodbye, My Fancy, fea
turing a cast of top Playhouse 
favorites under the direction of 
Frederick Burleigh.
Goodbye, My Fancy is con
cerned with the events that take 
place on the campus of an east
ern girls college during a Com
mencement weekend, when a fam
ed Congresswoman alumna re
turns after 20 years to receive an 
honorary degree. Her romance 
with the college president and a 
Life photographer covering the 
event, complicate matters.
In the role of the CongresswomHarold Wells, junior: Drama 
stud ents are 
different; they 
are t e in peramental, but that 
is a trademark 
of people in 
their profession. 
I think that 
some of the ec

put on. Often, 
dramats copy
orite actors. As a group they seem 
much friendlier toward each other 
than other departmental groups 
are. Perhaps this is because the 
type of work they do brings them 
together.

group feeling; 
what I mean is, 
they want to 
d i s ting uish 
t h e m s e 1 ves 
from the rest of 
the students. 
They have to 
develop an at
titude of uncon
cern toward at
tracting public attention so that 
they can adjust to the attention 
theyll receive on the stage. I 
have never had much contact with 
dramats, but I think that a lot of 
them are serious about their work. 
Some of them just fool around; 
and that happens in every group.
Sally Walker, junior: I think 
that some of 
the dramats are 
e x a g g erated. i 
but the reason ; 
for it is that it : 
is a field of ex- : 
pres sion, and : 
they almost j 
have to carry it j

think they are ^ 
odd. Im in Fine Arts and I see 
them rehearsing. It seems odd to 
us because were not dramats our
selves. We cant understand them; 
thats the whole thing in a nut 
shell.
Fritz Wilson, junior: Dramats 
have a com
pletely different 
outlook on life 
than we do; we 
dont under
stand them. 
They have less 
inhibition than 
most people do; 
they are trainr 
ed to be that 
way. All the 
dramats arent unusual, but we 
only notice xhe ones that are dra
matic. Its just like the belief that 
sailors are drunken. If five sailor.s 
are walking down the street and 
one of them is drunk, people will 
say, There goes a bunch of those

Plaid Defeats D&E 
In Season Opener
Brourman and Shechter Spark Win 
Simcic, Luchok, Paltos Score TD s
[ by H. Justin Davidson
The Tartans lived up to their press notices Saturday, although 
not by the three touchdown margin predicted, and finished strong 
to defeat the Davis and Elkins Senators 20-12.
Recovering a D&E fumble on the third play of the game, the
Tartans took the ball on the 46 and#--------------------------------------
marched downfield in nine plays] extra point, and the Tartans marto score. Only eight and one-half 
minutes of the first quarter had 
elapsed.
Pakos, freshman left end, tallied 
the marker, standing up, after 
catching Brourmans pass to the 
left flat. Dissents atempt for the 
extra point was blocked by Rice 
of D&E.
Looked Easy
Carnegie's second score came 
late in the first period. Brourman, 
fading back from his own 32, hit 
Luchok with a pass on the 35, and 
Johnny outran the D&E secondary 
for the touchdown. Gil Dissen's 
conversion made the score 13-0, 
and it began to look like a walk
away for the Plaid.
Shortly before Ihe half, another 
touchdown semed in the offing for 
the Plaid when they presed their 
way down to the D&E 16. How
ever. a fumble by Nick Simcic 
gave, the Maroon and White the 
ball as Heck recovered.
With time in the hall running 
out, quarterback Andy Guss.ie 
broke out with a rash of passes. 
On the fourth try Gussie. from 
his 29, connected with left half, 
Che't Riffle, on the Carnegie 35. 
Although covered by two Tartan 
defenders, Riffle snatched tne ball 
and scampered the rest of the way 
on a play good for 71 yards.
End of Drive
In the third period after the in
terception of a Brourman pass, 
D&E marched for another TD. 
After Gussics passes and Orrisons 
running had moved the ball down
field, Kother bulled over from the 
two yard line for the score.
The Senators again missed the
gin was cut to 13-12. However, 
any lingering doubts about the 
outcome of the game were dispelled early in the fourth quarter 
as the Tartans completed a 65 yard 
drive for their last score.
It was Shechters and Simcics 
legwork, with Brourman to Shech
ter passes, that moved the ball into 
position where Simcic took it over 
from the six.
Sophs Best 
During the remainder of the pe
riod Carnegie took complete con
trol of the game as D&E tired rap
idly. Playing conservative foot
ball. the Tartans were on the 28 
yard line as the gun sounded.
The two standout players for 
Carnegie were undoubtedly sopho
mores, Brourman and Shechter. In 
his first game as starting quarter
back, Brourman completed five of 
eight passes for a total of 129 
yards. Two of the passes were 
good for touchdown^
Shechter, a last minute choice 
to start at right halfback, gained 
consistently throughout the game. 
He provided drive for both the 
long marches, although at 148 
pounds, he was the' lightest man 
on the field.
Well Balanced 
The entire backfield unit dis
played balance, and each member 
showed power when needed. Leaman, defensive left half, made sev
eral bone-jarring tackles which 
slowed the Senators.
1 On the line Fougere, Whitenight, 
and Wiseman shone as they con
sistently stopped the Maroon and 
White ballcarriers.

High-Scoring Contests Seen In 
Intramural Football Opener
Emanon Impressive In Lopsided Victory; 
Passing Accounts For Majority Of Scoring
Intramural football finished its first week of league competition 
with 14 of the 22 teams seeing action. Four leagues have been 
formed to handle the squads. '.The Tartan and Skibo leagues con
tain six teams each while the Kiltie and Scottie leagues have only 
five in their ranks.
The first day of competition 
found Theta Xi downing the Citcom Clan by a 25 to 22 count. TX 
was trailing at the half, but Art 
Christopher caught a Clan passer 
behind the goal line for a safety 
and the tide began to turn. Bill 
Oxley, Dick Lynch, and Pete An
derson tallied for the winners with 
the latter crossing the goal' twice.
Regensburger and Jack Butler 
lead the Clans attack.
Delts Win 
Another first day game found 
Delta Tau Delta defeating the 
Sigma Nu A team 18-7. G.
Pyle was the outstanding man on 
the field as he tallied three of the 
victors touchdowns! Herb Madelene scored for Sigma Nu in the 
last quarter of play.
Rounding out the initial day's 
play, the Dorm D combination 
beat the Senior Chem Es 23-6.
Dorm D showed the way through
out the vgamc. Aldrich scored 
twice and Sedlock and Devos 
once apiece for Dorm D. Sokol 
hit pay dirt for Chem E.

Carnegie Gridders Hoping For 
1950 Seasons Second Victory
Bethany Bisons Combine Single-Wing Offense 
With Passing Attack; Decker Standout Back
On Saturday Coach Eddie Baker will send his Tartan cleaters 
against Bethany in an attempt to cop ttieir second victory. Fresh 
from their win over D&E, the Plaid will encounter a single-wing
passing offense when they take the field against the Bisons.
Their coach, Glenn Johnson, has 
a veteran team to work with, but 
there is a distinct lack of depth in 
the forward wall. Don Fuoss, line 
mentor, will be forced to call upon 
several of his line stalwarts for 
sixty minute service.
The Green and While will heav
ily outweigh the Skibos. On the 
line they average about 1&5 
pounds per man while the back
field has an average of nearly 181 
pounds.
They are captained by Carl Sta
ples, 6*4", 390 pound left e_nd, and 
Bernie Oakes, 6'2"/225 pound left 
tackle.. The running attack is lead 
by sophomore Bob Decker, a fast, 
shifty halfback! Bill Lee, John 
Rapp and Tom Pierro round out 
the remaining backfield positions.
This contest will be the eighth 
renewal of the rivalry, with Car
negie squads emerging victorious 
in six of* the previous metings. 
Last year C.I.T. downed Bethany 
on their home grounds by the 
humiliating score of 41 to 6. .With 
thirteen of lats year's squad mak
ing the trip to Pittsburgh this year, 
vengeance will be uppermost in 
the players minds.
Thus far the Bethany eleven has 
a record of one win and one loss. 
They dropped a close game to 
Davis & Elkins in .the opener, 
when a l^st quarter score sent 
them down to a 26-25 defeat. The 
second contest found them edging 
out a stuborn Marriette gridiron 
combination. Halfback George 
Taibi broke off cackle for 48 yards 
and a TD late in the third quarter 
to give the Bisons their first win.'''

Tartan Lineman Oi The Week
Herman Whitenight has been 
named as the Tartan Lineman of 
the Week. Although his playing 
was restricted to*defense, Whitenight proved to be the most steady 
and dependable man on the squad.
With Coach Bakers proteges us
ing a five-man defensive line, it 
was Whitenight who blocked the 
center of the line as D&Es backs 
constantly attempted to gain yard
age on line plunges.
Although the transfer P&D from 
Michigan State is only a sopho
more, he has shown a type of de
fensive play that fits in well with 
1he Plaid style of game.
It was mainly through Whitenights efforts that the opponents 
were limited to only 66 yards on 
 rushing, while the Tartan backs 
were able to amass a total of 154 
vards.
The chunky 180 lb. guard has 
been touted by Coach Baker as one 
of his chief hopes for the year as a 
defensive lineman.

The usual happy shouts and cheers of victory were no
ticeably absent in the Carnegie dressing room following last 
Saturdays win over Davis and Elkins. Naturally the Plaid 
gridders wer.e tired; it had been a long afternoon. However, 
this wasnt the prime reason for their lack of enthusiasm. 
Rather, they knew they had made too many mistakes, mis
takes that could cost them a victory against a more formid
able opponent.
Certainly they were happy to have finished on the long 
I end of the score. They had expressed a great deal of confi' dence prior to the game that they had a winning team, 
 and had lived-up to their promises. However,' they also 
: knew that they had plenty to learn before they could con! sider themselves a polished gridiron machine.
Of course, the visitors had furnished much stiller opposi
tion than anyone had supposed they would. The - Senators were 
definitely out7 to upset the favored Tartans and catnc danger
ously close to doing just that. It goes without saying .that Dr. 
Bakers boys would have been satisfied with an easier opponent 
for their opening game.
Many of the mistakes made by the Skibos were obvious
ly due to overanxiousness, particularly on the part of those 
who were filling their first starting assignments. Tackling 
was especially poor and downfield blocking could stand im
provement. Pass defense, though much better than it had 
been, will have to improve even more if the Plaid intends 
to outscore their opponents.
There was, however, one phase of football in which the 
Tartans could hardly hope to better themselves. The spirit and 
hustle shown by each member of the team, whether he was 
playing or* sitting on the bench, was downright tremendous. It 
is doubtful whether a football team could be found that can 
equal the 1950 Carnegie in regard to spirit. Throughout most of 
the game the shouts from the Tartan bench could be heard above 
the noise of the spectators. Although complimentary to the team, 
this certainly points-up the continued lack of spirit on the part 
of the students.
The team will, without a doubt, correct Iheir mistakes 
in regard to football but will the students correct their lack
adaisical attitude in regard to the team?

In Several Activities
The Womens Athletic Associa
tion is beginning its second year 
under a new constitution. The 
club system has been inaugurated 
with a sports club being formed in 
each athletic activity where there 
is sufficient interest. The members 
of the various clubs elect repre
sentatives to the WAA boaid. Per
manent members of'the board and 
officers are elected in the spring of 
the year for the coming year. Miss 
Dorothy Kanrich of the womens 
physidal education department 
serves as sponsor for the associa
tion, while Miss Shirley OMara 
and Miss Ruth Bush coach the 
various teams.
The aim of the WAA board is to 
set up an extensive intramural
