Thistle Picks Senior 
As Next Years Editor
Robert Levy, a junior printing major, has been elected to suc
ceed Pete West as editor of Carnegie Techs yearbook, the Thistle. 
Bob, who was .layout editor for last years Thistle, is also a member 
of Dorm Council, the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and Alpha
Phi Omega.
The other members of next 
years editorial staff are as fol
lows: Daniel Byers, assistant to
the editor; Robert Mair, business 
manager; Elmer Veres, advertis
ing manager; William Faust, 
candids editor; John Hale, pho

Dr. F. D. Rossini
Doctor Frederick D. Rdssini, 
professor and head of the depart
ment of chemistry at Carnegie 
Tech, has been elected to the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, a 
leading scientific organization with 
total national membership limited 
to about 450.
Besides heading the chemistry 
department, Doctor Rossini is di
rector of the petroleum research 
laboratory, which is engaged in 
distilling crude oil and its various 
chemical parts. This is the only 
project of its kind in existence and 
makes Carnegie Tech the world 
center for fundamental research in 
crude oil.
Doctor Rossini becomes the third 
National Academy of Sciences 
member in Western Pennsylvania, 
the 14th in the state, and is the 
first alumnus of Carnegie Tech to 
gain this honor.
script editor; James McCune, 
sports editor, and Wallace Hurky, 
layout editor. The art editor and 
seniors editor have not yet been 
appointed. Staff members, espe
cially typists, for next years staff 
are also needed.
Next Issue Started 
The new staff is already work
ing towards next years Thistle. 
Plans are being considered to add 
new interest to the book for pur
pose of getting away from the 
repetition that is common to most 
yearbooks. Furthermore, the staff 
plans to get subscriptions for 1500 
yearbooks next year, in spite of 
the anticipated decrease in enroll
ment due to the current man
power needs. This is 100 more 
subscriptions than the 1400 sold 
this year.
Early Photographs 
Next years plans, however, 
should not overshadow this years 
issue. The 1951 issue, which 
should be out Friday or Satur
day, is the Golden Anniversary 
issue and is larger than any other 
Thistle ever published. The first 
section features old pictures from 
1900 on, so that an impression of 
a 1906 Thistle is made.
Since the Thistle is going to be 
out on time this year, it has been 
announced that all copies that 
have been purchased must be 
claimed by June 15. There will 
also be 100 extra copies for any
one who has not yet purchased 
one.
New Members Installed, Officers Elected;
Davidson Will Head IS ext Council Program
By Larry Glavin
The last meeting of Student Council was highlighted by the 
installation of new members, election of officers, and the resignation 
of 11 members who had an excess of absences. Council also passed 
an amendment to its constitution calling for the reduction of its 
membership. ? ~

Baron Elliott 
At Senior Ball
Dance In Carnegie Hall 
On June 13 For $2
Baron Elliott and his 12 piece 
orchestra will provide the music 
when the seniors dance together 
for the last time as a class on June 
13, immediately following the Bac
calaureate ceremony.
From 9 to 12 p.m. all students 
receiving degrees at commence
ment will congregate in the foyer 
of the Carnegie Music Hall for the 
informal dance. Featured with El
liott will be vocalist Jimmy Con
fers.
Tickets can be purchased at 
$2.00 per couple every day while 
procuring commencement invita
tions at the Registrars Office, or in 
Skibo during the lunch hours.
Parents of the graduates will be 
admitted free of charge, according 
to Wes Apple, junior class presi
dent, who is in charge of the 
dance. The dance is being spon
sored this year by the junior class 
with the hope that it will become 
a traditional project.
Mortar Board pledges are assist
ing the group by selling tickets.
Paul Stettler, former president 
of Student Council, presented his 
farewell message, in which he 
recommended that in the future 
Council should attempt to take 
preventive rather than curative 
measures. Advising closer atten
tion to unexcused absences and 
the elimination of blanket excuses 
from meetings, he suggested that 
Council assign special jobs to 
qualified members of the student 
body, thereby obtaining closer 
contact with the students and also 
increasing the efficiency of Coun
cil. Concluding, he proposed that 
up to date copies of the constitu
tion and by-laws of Council be 
prepared and made available to 
members and the student body.
Requests Resignations 
Following his address, Stettler 
exploded a bombshell by invoking 
for the first time in many years 
the clause in the constitution of 
Student Council calling for the 
resignation of those members who 
had three or more unexcused ab
sences. He asked for and received 
the resignations of the following 
members: Trudy Albright, Har
old Hunt, George Lang, Emerson 
Pugh, Nancy MacDougall, Pat 
Snedden, Paul Stettler, Carol Wil
son, and A1 Rider.
After the resignations had been 
accepted, Stettler turned the 
chairmanship over to Len Hvizdos, 
formerly Council vice president. 
Hvizdos continued with the new 
business, which included the pro
posed amendment to reduce the 
size of Council. After much heat
ed discussion, the amendment was 
passed.
Text of Amendment 
It consists of three parts and 
reads as follows: Each officially
recognized college (E&S, FA, and 
MMCC) shall have one voting 
member on Council for every 200, 
or major portior thereof, full time, 
undergraduate day students en
rolled. The presidents of all class 
organizations (freshman, sopho
more, junior and senior classes) 
shall be included as non-voting 
members of Council. There shall 
be a minimum of 12 members on 
Council not including the presi
dents of the class organizations. 
This amendment, to be official, 
must now be passed by a vote of 
two-thirds of the members pres
ent at a general assembly. It is 
then subject to the approval of 
the Executive Board of CIT.
Will Increase Efficiency 
The amendment is an attempt 
to increase the effectiveness and 
efficiency of Council. Further
more, it will provide closer co
ordination between SC and class 
organizations by requiring the at
tendance of the class presidents. 
The last clause is designed to take

Bill Wayman New Scot Editor; 
Constitution Still Not Approved
The Scot, Carnegie Techs variety magazine, has announced the 
elections of a new editorial board for next year. According to the 
new editor, Bill Wayman, the constitution of the organization has 
not bee approved by Student Council or the school administration. 
Until that is done, he can make*---------------------------------------------
no definite statement about the 
policy for the coming year.
The 1951-52 staff includes:
Bill Wayman, editor; George 
Good, Cal Cruder, business man
agers; Margie Rex, Alan Rider, 
feature editors; Nancy Callaway, 
managing editor; Richard Whit
son, art editor; Paul Grafius, lay

culation manager; Richard Young, 
advertising manager; Sally Ward, 
Louanne Barberie, fashions; and 
Dolly Mitchell, personnel man
ager. The positions of publicity 
manager and technical advisor 
have not been filled as yet.
Successful Year 
Under the editorship of Jim 
Alemany, the Scot has completed
a fairly successful year. They had 
one unfortunate issue which was 
banned by thr* Deans office be
cause of a libelous article. Other
wise the sales of the magazine 
have been very good, with a com
plete sell-out on several issues.
Many successful changes were 
introduced by the editorial staff 
this year. The 8^4 x 11 size was 
introduced after the pocket-book 
size of the previous year was un
successful. More cartoons and 
humorous art work were devel
oped into outstanding features of 
the variety magazine.

of articles were Justin Davidson,

Editorials
A W orld Wide Problem
The student opinion polls conducted recently on campus 
concerning the MacArthur question point up a grave defi
ciency in the educational development of some students. 
These students, fortunately a minority in the survey, seem
ed to lack any clear understanding of the basic issues in
volved in the Korean stalemate.
An article in a late issue of the Pitt News, mentioned 
elsewhere on this page, describes Carnegie students as being 
the kind of guys who can manipulate a slide rule like nobodys 
business but who never . heard of the United Nations . . . 
or any other heretical ideas. In the majority of cases this criti
cism is entirely unfounded. But, unfortunately, there remains 
that minority which reads Smiling Jack and the sports page 
and then consigns the evening paper to the bottom of the basket.
Those who ignore the important national and interna
tional issues of the day are defeating the very purpose of 
educationand especially of education as exemplified by the 
Carnegie Plan. Not only that, but the preservation of our 
democracy depends as much on an informed, thinking public 
as it does on electronic computers and productive capacity.
Though students must, of necessity, be concerned with 
their academic persuits, there is always time to stay reason
ably well informed on current problems. Ivory towers went J 
out of vogue with the atom bomb.
The Proof Of The Pudding . . .
Now that the passage of time has allowed the smoke to 
clear on the late Dr. Dohertys policy of athletic de-em
phasis, students are beginning to realize the merits of the 
program. Carnegies athletic teams of the past year, play
ing opponents of comparable size and ability, have demon
strated that winning ways can be maintained despite rug
ged academic schedules.
The track and football teams, especially, have given Car
negie supporters much to cheer about this year. Boasting a 7-1 
record in football and a track team undefeated in the regular 
seasons competition, Tech has proved that athletic scholarships 
and free-riding muscle men aren't essential to successful inter
collegiate athletics.
This new view toward the problem of commercialized 
athletics, plus an expanded and improved intramural pro
gram, has placed Tech in an enviable position with regard 
to those schools where education appears to have taken a 
, back seat to high-powTered athletics.
Orchids To APO
With all the talk about the decline of activities, we may 
be prone to neglect credit where credit is due. Such a case 
is APO, national scouting honorary.
APO is one honorary in which service to the school and 
students is uppermost in the minds of its members. The or
ganization does a surprising number of those thankless but nec
essary jobs which must be done if social events are to be suc
cessful. Besides publishing the C-Book and checking coats at 
most of the schools dances, APO conducts elections, handles 
decorations for Student Council, and collects tickets at athletic 
contests. In short, the scope of their activity is both wide and 
varied.
APO plans an even further expansion next semester. 
Heres hoping continued success for one of the most necessary 
and versatile of campus organizations.

Editor, the TARTAN:
At the risk of being accused of 
sour grapes, we would like to vent 
several of our views toward the 
annual Sweepstakes design award.
First, let us make it clear that 
we have no disagreement with the 
selection of the first place design 
award this year because that bug
gys performance indicates that it 
was designed to win the race. Our 
attitude is based on the premise 
that all buggies should be built to 
win races. It seems to us that bug
gies which are not designed to win 
races should not consistently win 
design awards. Please notice that 
we did not say that buggies that 
win races should also receive the 
design trophies.
There has been a growing trend 
in the past few years for organiza
tions to choose between two goals. 
One group builds buggies in an at
tempt to win the race; the other 
builds them to win design. To 
us, this cuts the spirit of racing 
competition in half.
In our opinion, much of the fault 
should be placed at the feet of the 
design judges. In the past three 
years of our experience with the 
Sweepstakes, we believe that none 
of the judges have had enough 
understanding of the basic fac
tors which influence the design of 
a fast buggy. They are too easily 
impressed with complicated, but 
inaccurate, steering aftd suspen
sion systems. Too much emphasis 
is placed upon esthetic prettiness 
while aerodynamic qualities are 
slighted. We wonder if theyve 
even considered the importance 
of weight distribution, tire friction, 
and general roadability.
Perhaps if the buggy that has 
really NEEDED the rear view mir
rors for the past four years had 
incorporated a cigar lighter, a slid
ing cockpit cover, parking lights, 
and a Buick grill, it, too, might 
have placed in the design 
awards.
We would like to make two sug
gestions for next year. First, see 
if judges could be chosen from 
men who really understand the 
factors which influence fast buggy 
design. Every year there is a Pitts
burgh Soap Box Derby race. The 
construction judges .that handle 
that race might be willing to judge 
Techs Sweepstakes design com
petition. Secondly, we suggest 
that a qualification be made that 
buggies must pL*ce in the top half 
in the race to be eligible for the 
design awards.
Perhaps we have missed the 
point of the design awards. If so, 
we would like to hear from those 
who feel differently about the sub
ject.
Sincerely,
Thomas M. Birch 
Sellers B. McNally
The following is a copy of the 
letter sent to the editor of the Pitt 
News in reply to an article ap
pearing in a recent issue of that 
publication. A copy of that article 
can be seen on the bulletin board 
in Administration Hall.
$ H* i
Editor, the Pitt News:
Your May 16 issue contained an 
article titled Pitt Beats TechAt 
Last which drew some interesting 
and largely erroneouscompar
isons between Pitt and Carnegie 
Tech.
I for one find it hard to be
lieve that almost everyone agreed 
that Pitts float parade was far 
superior to the similar extrava
ganza concocted by our neighbors 
across the valley . . . Having had 
an opportunity to observe both 
parades, I am quite certain that 
the author of the article in ques
tion would have to eat chow if 
a more direct comparison were 
availableeven though Tech was 
hampered by a steady rain during 
the float construction period.
The article also charges that 
Carnegie Tech was unable to put 
on worthwhile student entertain
ment. I assume that the author 
has never heard of Scotch n 
Sodaa nationally famous stu
dent organization which writes, 
directs, and produces a complete 
musical comedy each year at 
Spring Carnival. Every member of 
the cast is a student.
Other implications contained in 
the article are hardly worth refut
ing. Any Pitt student retreating to 
the backwash of intellectual ac
tivity over on Forbes Street will 
soon find the Tech student are 
anything but narrow specialists 
who have never heard of the Unit
ed Nations or racial prejudice. I 
doubt if he will find many Tech 
men who have clean-cut eagle 
scout friends, who never smokes 
. . . who squires around a chaste
Think It Over
By Dick Ahlstrom
This semester will soon be over, 
and all the happy students at 
Carnegie Tech will be heading 
home to a restful summer of work 
and play. Since this is the last 
issue of the TARTAN I should 
like to present a thought that is 
worth reflecting.
Last year, over in Paris, I met 
a mans man. A blond, athletic 
viking who wants to cross the 
Atlantic in a kayak. It was he 
who brought my attention to this 
little philosophical tidbit.
 Be a Thief
This fellow is no college man. 
He went to sea at the age of 14, 
escaped death by inches, wowed 
the women, and obtained his first 
mates papers, all by the time that 
he reached the tender, or other
wise ,age of 25. He has been around 
and has developed a simple phi
losophy which can be summed up 
in three words, Be a thief.
I recommend it. It is a phifosophy that cannot be beaten. Too 
many students want everything 
handed to them. Theyve no initi
ative to learn things by them
selves. Thats what Rolf meant. 
Material things have no value in 
the overall picture. They are not 
worth stealing. The important 
thing is what is in the mind.
Steal the Answer
In Rolfs words, Keep your 
eyes open, remember what you 
see, steal it, and use it.
Too often Ive heard students 
say after an exam, That ques
tion wasnt fair. To a thief such 
questions are not only fair, they 
are challenges. Heres something 
worth while yet to be stolen, some
thing he doesnt know. Who can 
he watch; what book can he read; 
who might know, that he may 
steal the answer from him?
Field Day For Thieves 
Similarly, how often do students 
go to class and just listen to the 
instructor' and never bother to 
steal what the instructor doesnt 
bother to give away. How many 
students study the prof., the boss, 
the minister, to steal that which 
makes them successful and ap
ply it to themselves so that they 
too will be better.
If youre going to college you 
must wish to be better. What a 
field day a thief has. Nothing is 
outside of his realm. But to be 
successful in his work a thief has 
to have something a lot of students 
seem to lackactive brains.
College is often too easy for real 
brains, and so they rot like an 
onion left in a damp bin, without 
ever having flowered.
Brains and Common Sense 
Psychology has a lot of fancy 
terms for things, but a good thief 
augments his brains with that 
which the psychologists with all 
their fancy terms have no better 
term for than the simple, old fash
ioned term ofcommon sense. 
With brains and common sense 
any man who tries can become a 
thief. But it isnt enough to be a 
thief. Any gutter snipe can suc
ceed in this. The crown jewels are 
only for the diligent, the patient, 
and the intelligent.
When you go out this summer, 
steal. Steal everything worth 
while that you see. Dont wait for 
it to be handed to you. Steal it.
maiden whose lips have never 
touched liquor. 
In short, the article appears a 
misdirection of both fact and opin
ion. An article appearing under 
the name of the assistant editor, as 
did this one, should describe the 
situation accurately as well as au
thoritatively.
Perhaps the Tartan should have 
ignored this flight into fancy, but 
here was a case where the mis
statements were big enough to be 
believed. Incidently, I dont be
lieve youll find many Tech stu
dents cavorting over the sward in 
their white saddles and plaid 
hats. Come up and see.

standing articles by the faculty 
and other sources are accepted. 
Feature Overlooked 
A feature of the magazine whieh 
is often overlooked by students 
is the chance to gain cash prizes 
by answering the questions found 
in the Techsperts section, or by 
submitting questions of their own 
to the column. No mathematical 
background more advanced than 
that expected of freshmen and 
sophomore engineers is needed 
for the solutions.
JR easy-going, big-billed friend has learned to say No 
to these hurry-up, one-puff, one-sniff cigarette tests! Why, says he,
they don't even give you time to finish the cigarette before youre supposed 
to decide which is mildest! Millions of smokers have come to the same conclusion 
theres just one real way to test the flavor and mildness of a cigarette!
It's the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test, 
which simply asks you to try Camels as a steady smoke 
on a pack-after-pack, day-after-day basis. No snap judgments 
needed! After youve enjoyed Camelsand only 
Camelsfor 30 days in your "T-Zone 
(T for Throat, T for Taste), we believe youll know why . .

The deadline for receipt of 
Selective Service College

Kenneth R. Burchard, an au
thority in the graphic arts field, 
has been appointed professor and 
head of Carnegie Techs depart
ment of printing management.
A recognized expert on photo
mechanical reproduction, Profes
sor Burchard has had broad ad
ministrative experience in graphic 
arts, as well as being a teacher and 
author. He is also manager of off
set and photomechanical sales for 
American Type Founders, Inc.
He learned the printing trade as 
printers devil with a country 
weekly, the Gasxonade County Re
publican, Owensville, Missouri. 
Prior to joining American Type 
Founders, Inc. in 1944, Prof. 
Burchard was assistant manager of 
i subcontracting for Goodyear Air
craft Corporation. From 1930 to 
1943 he was a member of the 
; teaching staff of the Carnegie tie| partment which he now heads.
Following graduation from Wili liam Jewell College, Liberty,

for the past year.
Departments 
Cooperate And 
Produce Book
A new experiment in inter-de
partmental cooperation has been 
conducted by the printing manage
ment and the painting and design 
departments.
For the first time, the printers 
and artists have worked hand-inglove on the layout of a book, 
Death of a Salesman. Each group 
tried to learn the problems of the 
otherthe artists gaining informa
tion about the limitations and 
scope of the printing processes, 
and the printers in turn learning 
how to work with the artists so 
that the production of the book is 
within reason yet faithfully ad
heres to the artists ideas.
As a result of this experiment, 
it is hoped these particular stu
dents will be better able to work 
with their associates when they 
graduate into industry. Their 
work, including all phases of the 
production of the book, may be 
inspected in the exhibition hall, 
Fine Arts building, beginning Fri
day, May 25.
It is hoped that this exp 
in cooperation with the ar 
carry over into other field 
dustry, represented by the indus
trial administration and engineer1 ing departments of Carnegie.

Track Team Unbeaten In Dual Meets
Tartans End Season 
With Win Over Titans
Bateman And Relay Team Break
Own Records Set Last Week
Defeating Westminster 74^-56%, the Carnegie track team end
ed an undefeated season of dual competition Tuesday for the first 
time since Carnegie has fielded a team of cindermen. The win came 
as a fitting climax to a season which had started slowly with a 
close 64-63 win over the RoughRiders of Case.
The win was not without its mo
ments of anguish, however, as the 
Tartans sweated out their final 
victory. At the end of the first ten 
events the score stood tied at 45 
all and the outlook wasnt too 
bright for the Tartans. However, 
the Skibos picked up speed in the 
final five events to finally con
quer the Titans by 18 points.
Taylor Scores 
Chief point getter for the Tar
tans was Maurice Moose Tay
lor, the Skibos only double win
ner of the day. Heaving the six
teen pound shot 38 7*4 and fol
lowing with a 120 1 toss of the 
discus, Moose picked up the only 
Plaid points in the two events yet 
still outscored the Westminster 
entrants.
Westminster had two double 
winners in McGrath and Bloom. 
Richard Bloom, a brother of Bill 
Bloom on the Carnegie team, 
turned in wins in both the rfiile 
and two mile runs. His times of 
4:39.5 for the mile and 10:15.2 for 
the two mile run were the fastest 
seen on the Carnegie oval in some 
time. Bloom was followed in both 
the mile and two mile by Bob 
Carmen for the Skibos.
Other Twin Win 
McGrath provided the other 
twin win for the Titans as he swept 
the 100 and 220 yard dashes in the 
times of 10.0 and 22.7 seconds re
spectively. Johnny Luchok man
aged to save a second for Carnegie 
in the 100 while Fritz Wilson add
ed a third in the 220. The Titans 
Art Jones was off form as he took 
only a third in the 100 and a sec
ond in the 220 yard dash.
In the 440 yard dash Fred Price 
turned in one of his best times of 
the year as he outsped his compe
tition in 52.5. Jim Valias also plac
ed second for the Skibos.
Miss Hurdles 
Connie Hamman was unable to 
repeat his usual double win in the 
hurdles as he strangely faltered 
near the finish in the 120 yard 
lows and teammate Jim Milligan 
passed him by for the win spot. 
Hammann, took his usual first in 
the high hurdles, however, and 
nabbed second behind Milligan in 
the lows. Milligan finished second 
in the high hurdles.
In the pole vault, Chuck Bate
man broke the record he had set 
only the week before as he passed 
the crossbars at 12 feet, 6% inches.
Sweep Jump 
The Tartans practically salted 
away their undefeated season 
when they swept the broad jump 
with Luchok, Wood, and Milligan 
taking away the honors. The Ski
bos added more points as Bate
man and McKibben took second 
and third in the javelin and Ham 
man took second while Milligan 
tied for third in the high jump.
Another record was set in the 
last event of the day as the relay 
team of Wilson, Luchok, Price, 
and McKibben set a new mark of 
2:38.5 for the 4/5 mile.

Plaid Third In Tri-State Meet 
As Westminster Cops First
Chuck Bateman Smashes Tri-State Record
In Pole Vault By More Than Eight Inches
A Tartan bid to cap an undefeated season with the post-season 
Tri-State championship was foiled by villains Westminster and Betha
ny, Saturday, as the Plaid team was able to place no better than 
third in the annual meet. *
Competing at the Slippery Rock 
oval, the Skibos saw surprising 
Westminster, a team they had just 
defeated in dual competition, walk 
off with the nine-team champion
ship with a total of 41% points. 
Bethany, whom the Tartans did 
not meet in the regular season, 
finished with 36% points while 
the Plaid was right behind with 
33%.
Six New Records
In an amazing meet which pro
duced six new records in the fif
teen events, Carnegie did have 
the satisfaction of producing one 
of the record breakers. In the pole 
vault Chuck Bateman cleared the 
crossbar at 12 feet 6V4 inches, 
smashing by almost nine inches 
the old standard and almost 
equaling his own record of 12 
feet, 6% inches set Tuesday in 
the meet with Westminster.
Johnny Luchok continued his 
winning ways with a leap of 20 
feet, 9 inches in the broad jump 
and a quarter mile part on the 
winning relay team. Johnny was 
defeated in his specialty, the 100 
yard dash, by McGrath of West
minster in the slow time of 10.2, 
but managed to place second.
Connie Hammann, .vho lowered 
the Carnegie high hurdle record 
to 15.3 seconds this year met with 
a better man Saturday as White
head of Bethany clipped off the 
Sticks in 15.1. Hammann placed 
second in the high hurdles, fourth 
in the low hurdles, and added a 
tie for the fourth in the high 
jump.
Relay Wins
The mile relay team of Bill Mc
Kibben, Fritz Wilson, Johnny Lu
chok, and Fred Price was the 
third Tartan winner as they 
walked away from their compe
tition in the fast time of 3 min
utes, 31.5 seconds.
The stiff competition was tough 
on many of the Carnegie teams 
who had been turning in consist
ent first and seconds in their 
events. *
Dave Douglas placed fifth in 
the half mile run, which he has 
usually won. He added a fifth, 
however, in the record breaking 
220 yard dash, which was won in 
the best time of the day, 21.9 sec
onds.
To prove the remarkable time 
of the 220 which was won by John 
McElravey of W & J, one has 
only to multiply the time for the 
100 yard dash, 10.2 seconds by 
2.2 the proportional distance of 
the 220 yard dash to come out 
with the time of 22.44 seconds. 
Considering the fact the time for 
the 220 was one-half second under 
this. McElravey was really burn
ing up the track.
Other Pointmakers
Other pointmakers for the Tar
tans were Taylor, who placed 
fifth in the shot put, Bateman, 
who added to his score, with a 
fourth in the javelin throw, Bob 
CarYnan with a fourth in the mile, 
and Fred Price with a fifth in the 
440 yard dash.
Interesting note of the meet 
was the fact the Westminster 
cause was aided considerably by 
the brother of one of the Skibo 
trackmen. Dick Bloom of West
minster beat his brother, Bill 
Bloom of Carnegie in the two mile 
run. Dick also added a second in 
the mile for the Westminster 
cause. His time of 10 minutes, 
11.1 seconds in the two mile run 
was one of the best performances 
of the day as he lowered the old 
record by an amazing 14 seconds.

More BOUNCE To The Ounce
Tennis Team Brings 
Season Slate To 7-2
Carnegie Techs highly successful 1951 tennis team continued 
its winning ways Saturday afternoon by defeating Grove City 9-0. 
The victory brought the Tartan record for the season to seven wins 
and two defeats. *
Two close, tense matches in the 
number one and number two 
singles were the feature of Satur
days encounter with Grove City. 
Bob Wiederhorn came from be
hind twice to pull his match out 
of the fire, 3-6, 7-5, 8-6. Twice his 
opponent, Bob Wiley, had the score 
at match point, but Wiederhorn 
rallied brilliantly to come out the 
winner.
$ Montstream Wins
John Montstream won the first 
set in his match against Grove 
Citys Poppleton the hard way, 
7-5. Easing the pressure in the 
second set he dropped it 4-6. How
ever, fast service and hard play 
eventually proved more than Pop
pleton could handle as Monstream 
emerged the victor, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2.
Don Duncklee won the number 
three singles match in straight 
sets, 6-4, 6-1, turning the tables on 
Bob Davis, who had defeated him 
earlier in the season. Mahlon Saible also was an easy victor, re
peating his earlier defeat of Ihnatko, 6-3, 7-5. Bob Duff us and Carl 
Finder, Techs number five and 
six men, respectively, also won to 
enable Tech to sweep the singles.
In the first doubles contest of 
the afternoon Duffus and Larry 
Cederstrom teamed up to defeat 
Wiley and Poppleton 6-0, 6-4. 
Duncklee and Saible kept the rec
ord perfect by taking Davis and 
Tower, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and George 
Berringer and John Alexander 
completed the afternoons work 
with a 6-4, 10-8 victory over 
Leetch and Yezerinac.
Pitt Too Tough
Pitt handed the Skibos their sec 
ond defeat of the year last Wed
nesday, 7-2. Loehstetter, Campney, 
and Rouf, rated one, two, and 
three in Western Pennsylvania de
feated Wiederhorn, Montstream, 
and Duncklee in that order.
The Panthers went on to sweep 
the singles play and, with the 
combination of Lehstetter and 
Campney, defeat Wiederhorn and 
Montstream in the first doubles 
match. Duncklee and Saible, how
ever, won their double? contest 
with Bendel and Lichtman. Duffus 
and Cederstrom also came through 
to prevent a shut-out.
On Monday, Tech defeated 
Thiel, 6-1, Davey, defeating Bob 
Wiederhorn in the first match of 
the afternoon, was the only one 
to mar the Tartan clean sweep.

Officers Elected
New members were installed 
and new officers were elected. 
Justin Davidson was elected presi
dent and Dick Mitchell, vice pres

Davidson congratulated the past 
officers on the fine jobs they had 
done and expressed the hope that 
the new council could continue to 
improve on their record. He also 
mentioned tha+ the absentee policy 
would continue to be enforced.
The committee reports included 
advice for action to be taken dur
ing the next semester such as 
possible revision of the by-laws 
with regard to publications, the 
establishment of a permanent pubaction on the suggestions which 
it had received. Through some of 
these suggestions chocolate milk 
was put on sale in Skibo and a 
new common faucet wash bowl

Baseball Impractical 
Bob Stroble reported his find

Editor .................................................................................... Frank Mihelich
News Editor ........................................................................... Martha Latza
In Fare well
As is the custom for the last edition of the Plaid, the 
editor always writes a brief resume of what has or has not 
been accomplished during his editorship, but to be different 
we would like to pass on to the future editor a bit of ad
vice, and a few suggestions pertaining to the Plaid.
Evening students should be made to realize their re
sponsibility towards their paper. It is through the Plaid 
that they can best voice their opinions and thoughts, but 
they fail to do this. The Plaid is only as effective as its dis
tribution is wide. Insist that the paper be placed at the most 
advantageous locations each school evening.
Cooperation with the Tartan staff is imperative.
The Plaid staff can be large or small, it matters not, it 
is the contribution of news items that fill the paper. This 
news can best be obtained from the Evening School Regis
trars office and at Evening Student Council Meetings.
In conclusion we would like to thank those students who 
have helped us, and to express a hope that by our efforts, 
some measure of enjoyment was obtained from the Plaid 
during the past school year.
New Evening SC Prexy Leader 
In Extracurricular Activities
Past President Of Sigma Delta Phi, B. May 
Was Treasurer Of Council For 1949-1950
So that evening students will get a preview of the new Presi
dent of Evening Student Council, we will present Byron May, in this 
semesters last edition of the Plaid.
Byron is a conscientious, hard working evening student who 
to find time for extra-*-----------------------------manages
curricular activities even though 
he carries a tough school sched
ule, a responsible job, and has a 
family.
Byron has been enrolled in the 
mechanical engineering depart
ment for the past five years, and 
plans some day to obtain a de
gree in mechanical engineering.
Byron is assistant chief engineer 
at American Chain and Cable 
Company in Monessen, Pa., and 
one of his duties at present is the 
engineering and supervision of 
the coal handling plant being 
erected by his company.
Byron Is past president of Sig
ma Delta Phi, and member of 
Council for the past three years. 
He has been Handbook editor for 
two years, Council Treasurer for 
the school year 1949-1950, and 
he was co-chairman of the en
gineering banquet this year.
Byron is happily married and
finds much enjoyment with his 
two children, when he is not 
delving into his school books or 
arranging some function for 
Evening Student Council. Even 
with his busy schedule Byron still 
finds some time to play the game 
he most enjoys, golf.
He is secretly nursing the am
bition to some day install a com
plete wood working shop in his 
basement. If his efforts at even
ing school are any indication, we 
venture to say that it wont be 
too long before the saws will be 
buzzing in the Mays basement.
The evening students are again 
fortunate in obtaining a fine per
son who will manage their coun
cil with dignity. With a little co
operation, Byron May will give 
the students a good student gov
ernment.
