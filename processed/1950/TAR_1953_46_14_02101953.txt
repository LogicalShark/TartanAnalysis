nounced the initiation of a new series of uninterrupted classical and 
semi-classical programs. By the time all schedule changes are made, 
WRCT shall have more classical* '
music than any other station in the 
Pittsburgh vicinity.
For the achievement of our 
goals, WRCT thanks Sam Goody, 
the worlds largest record distrib
utor, the Eastern States Radio cor
poration, the Woodlawn pharmacy, 
the National Record Mart, and the 
many other loyal sponsors WRCT 
has obtained through the past se
mester.

Long History Behind Carnegie Kilties
Band To Present Concert
The Kiltie band of Carnegie Tech will open its symphonic season 
at Carne|le music hall on Friday, February 13, at 8:15 p.m. The 
concert will be conducted by Robert B. Cantrick, assistant professor 
of music education at Carnegie and director of the Kiltie band.
Unusual Rendition *-----------------------------------------
Pittsburghers will hear for the 
first time the presentation of Mu
sic for a Festival, a suite for 
band with interludes for brass 
choir by Gordon Jacob. This un
usual piece was commissioned by 
the arts council of Great Britain 
for the 1951 Festival of Britain.
During the Pittsburgh presen
tation of Music for a Festival, 
the Kiltie brass choir will play 
from a balcony overlooking the 
stage in Carnegie hall. This is a 
revival of *a medieval tradition 
when town musicians in Germany 
played from a tower overlooking 
their village as an announcement 
for village ceremonies.
Extra Instruments
Another major selection of the 
program will be the Polka and 
Fugue from the opera, Schwanda, The Bagpiper by Jaromir 
Weinberger. Schwanda, a legend
ary figure from Czech folklore, is 
the hero of the opera whose skill 
on the bagpipes was so bewitching 
that he piped himself out of the 
Devils clutches and into the favor 
of the highest court in the land.
This score calls, for a galaxy of 
extra instruments in addition to 
the usual onespipe organ, harp, 
crimes and a choir of trumpets 
offstage. (The offstage trumpet 
choir will be replaced by a corps 
of bagpipers onstage.) With this
selection, the Kilties claim to be 
the first symphonic band in the 
United States to utilize a large 
bagpipe section in their perform
ance of a concert piece.
Selections
As a result of the national at
tention which the band has re
ceived because of its many ap
pearances, it has become the 
model of high school bands in this 
area Therefore, every year selections are included in the Kil
ties program which are on the 
state contest list for high school 
bands. The selections this year 
are If Thou Be Near, a song 
transcribed for band by J. S. 
Bach and River Jordan, a fan
tasy on Negro spirituals by Mau
rice Whitney.
Also included in the concert 
are Sousas Liberty Bell march 
and The Barber of Seville Over
ture by Rossini.
Admission charge for adults is 
75c and for high school students 
50c. Tickets may be obtained 
through the Kiltie band, Carne
gie Institute of Technology, or at 
the box office on the evening of 
the performance.
Began Wearing Kilts
A band at Carnegie was in ex
istence since 1910, but it wasnt 
until Red Trent, drum major, 
conceived the idea of wearing 
kilts and a bearskin shako in 1917 
that the Kiltie band came into be
ing. He was the only member so 
garbed and the rest of the Band 
appeared in regulation blue uni
forms.
After the idea to costume the 
entire band in kilts was aproved, 
fuftds for this purpose were raised 
by a special committee of the 
CIT Student Council. Eight pipes

Famous Show Given; 
No Classes Dismissed
by Jo Forsythe
The centurys most famous singing band leader, Vaughn 
Monroe, will bring his entire Racing With the Moon Camel 
Caravan to the Tech campus on Monday, February 16. At 
that time, he will offer a musical salute to the college as
-------------?part of his nation-wide program.
The show, to be held in the gym 
at 3:30 p.m., will be recorded and 
heard Saturday, February 21 at 
7:30 p.m. over the coast-to-coast 
CBS network. The doors of the 
gym will be closed promptly at 
3:40 and students will positively 
not be admitted after that. 
Variety Show 
Once a voice student at Tech, 
Monroe will bring his orchestra, 
the Moon Maids and Moon Men 
and a guest vocalist. Following 
the half-hour radio recording, the 
Camel Caravan, sponsored by the 
R. J. Reynolds company for Camel 
cigarettes, will present a half-hour 
Variety show. Possibilities for a 
reception for the entertainers are 
being reviewed. Definite plans 
will be announced later.
In this salute to Tech, such 
songs as Fight for the Glory of 
Carnegie, Dear Old Tech, and 
Alma Mater, will be presented 
to an estimated audience of 2200. 
Fans from nearby high schools are 
expected to attend the show, for 
which there is no admission 
charge.
Original contacts by Monroes 
manager were made as early as 
January 10 with Stanley March, 
director of public relations. Four 
campus groups are making the 
shows possible by financing the 
necessary stage extension in the 
gym and renting a speciallypitched piano Supplying the 
needed $250 are Student Council, 
Council of Fraternity Presidents, 
and the Mens and Womens Dorm 
Councils.
Rules
Several ground rules were 
passed by the Executive board 
including the following:

Scotch n Soda 
Scouts Talent 
This Week
Now +hat the second semester 
is pretty well underway, students 
are beginning to realize that 
Spring Carnival and Scotch n 
Soda are just around the corner. 
The board of Scotch n Soda is 
already aware of this and has 
scheduled the singing, dancing, 
and acting tryouts for this Sat
urday and next, February 14 and 
21.
This years show Shoot The 
Works will not be a book show, 
and therefore the time spent in 
rehersals will be less compared 
to last since each scene or skit 
is a seperate unit.
For those students who would 
like to work in a production which 
is handled on a professional level 
With students from all the depart
ments of Tech, Scotch n Soda 
offers the perfect chance to get 
into the Spring activity whirl.
The needs of Shoot The Works 
have been tailored to those in 
every college, and each partic
ipant reaps more benefits that be
ing on the stage for three days. 
Numerous parties are scheduled 
throughout the rehersal period 
and a large picnic is thrown after 
the show is closed. Everyone in 
the cast or on the crews is eligi
ble for the $100 Scotch n Soda 
scholarship.
Singers are requested to bring 
their own tryout number to the 
tryouts .on Saturday, Scotch n 
Soda will furnish the accompan
ist. Those interested in acting may 
bring their own script, but there 
will be some on hand. The try
outs begin at 1:30 in the Little 
Theater.
Historical Drama 
Lecture Series 
Begin February 10
For four consecutive weeks be
ginning on February 10, the de
partment of English will present 
a series of talks on four historical 
dramas of Shakespeare (two of 
which are to be produced by the 
department of drama this spring). 
These talks will be given in the 
College of Industrial Administra
tion auditorium on Tuesdays at 
11:30 a.m. Carnegie students and 
members of the faculty and staff, 
their families, and their friends 
are invited to attend.
The schedule is as follows:

The current play at the Play

Cecil Holm. The music and lyrics 
were written by Hugh Martin and 
Ralph Blane.
Two Carnegie students are tak
ing part in the current Playhouse 
production, Harvey Jurik is a 
member of the outstanding cast 
which has been assembled by 
director Frederick Burleigh. Play
ing the pian fr the production is 
Hyla Goldstein, a piano major in 
the College of Fine Arts. The mu
sical will run at the Playhouse on 
Craft avenue until March 7.
Professorship Established; 
Alcoa Sponsors New Position
A new professorship in mechanical engineering has been estab
lished at Carnegie Tech through a grant from the Aluminum Com
pany of America. The new chair will be held by Dr. Dennistoun 
Wood VerPlanck, professor and head of Carnegies mechanical en
gineering department. A graduate* 
of MIT and Yale, Dr. VerPlanck 
has been at Carnegie since 1946.
The new chair will be named 
the Alcoa professorship in en
gineering. This educational sup
port wlil be used to strengthen 
fundamental research in the gen
eral field of mechanical engineer
ing, as well as in specific prob
lems that exist in the aluminum 
industry.
Dr VerPlanck plans to spend 
part of his summer months in 
several of Alcoas plants search
ing for practical problems to bring 
to the classroom. He joined the 
Carnegie faculty in 1946 as pro
fessor of electrical engineering.
His wide professional experience 
in engineering, his broad educa
tional background, and his out
standing qualifications as a teach
er and administrator led to his 
appointment as head of the me
chanical engineering department 
in 1947.

Lewis Davidson has stayed on as 
director of the student pipers on 
a faculty status.
World War II found a few 
women students in the ranks of 
the Kilties but the outfit is ex
clusively masculine. As soon as 
veteran band members returned 
from the war, the girls left.

Letter
Dumb Bell
Editor, the Tartan:
It is not often that I feel inclined to write a 
letter to the editor, being a passive individual at 
heart. But I do have a complaint that has triecf 
my patience.
Anyone who has had classes in the 340 wing of 
Administration hall will bear out the fact that no 
one can hear the signal for the beginning or end 
of classes. Many instructors are very particular 
that their students get to class on time, but the 
school in this instance does not seem to care when 
classes begin or end.
Most of the subjects taught in this wing are 
either English or SocRel courses. I have found 
that by the end of the period these instructors are 
so engrossed in the subject at hand that they forget j 
to pull out the watch and stop the discussion when 
it is supposed to end. Many classes run as much|as ten minutes over quitting time. For the student i 
that has to go to another building for the next 
hour it means he is caught between the devil 
and the deep blue sea. On one side he has to 
content with not getting excused on time and on 
the other he has to face an irritated professor when 
he walks into the next class late.
The administration did a very good job of hav
ing the rooms in this wing remodeled, but they 
seem to have forgoten one important item. Why 
not correct it now by putting a bell where it can 
be heard by everyone concerned?
Signed,
A Slow Walker.
Lets Plant Ivy
Editor, the Tartan:
As I pass the new SIA building daily, I am 
amazed by the rapid growth of foliage on the lawn. 
Each day a new crop of holly and yew trees springs 
from mother earth to beautify (or deface) the 
grounds of our newest structure.
But what I want to know is: When will the 
SIA gardeners get around to planting ivy? And 
if they do, will they plant shoots and let them 
grow from the bottom, or will they insist on stap
ling a foil grown vine to the side of the building 
so that it can join the ranks of the ivy covered 
halls before it passes its first year of service?
It is of course very nice to have a certain 
amount of greenery surrounding campus buildings, 
and a tree or two could certainly never do the IA 
building any damage. But it seems that either 
someone on the executive board has reason to 
want the IA lawn to compete with the Everglades 
as a home of thick foliage; or that Dean Bach has 
a brother who operates  nursery.
In short, I am inclined to feel that there can 
be such a thing as too many trees. And if we 
dont have too many already, we will by the time 
a few more are planted on the SIA grounds.
Yours truly
I. V. League.

Editorial
Back To The Classroom!
Throughout the last semester we did a little complain
ing in the Tartan about the seemingly heavy emphasis 
placed on graduate study and graduate students by some of 
the more scientific departments of Carnegie Tech. Since 
the semi-annual publication of the IBM department was 
released two weeks ago, the Skibo griping circles have been 
throwing back and forth the names of numerous instructors 
who, it seems, didnt grade according to Hoyle.
Our original complaint was directed to those instructors 
who only give one test and little homework throughout the 
semester, and thus their students begin to wonder, when 
the semester is half over, on what their grade will be based. 
But, it seems we overlooked another kind of culprit, the pro
fessor who gives tests and problems all through the semes
ter, but is too busy at the end to evaluate the final grade on 
the basis of all this work. So, he merely takes the grade 
made by each student, on the final and says that it represents 
what the student did get out of the course; although the 
final may have only encompassed the work of the final few 
weeks.
This approach is not fair to the student who has worked 
hard all through the term and did not hit the final. Especially 
when the instructor is too busy with his projects to write a 
complete final is it easy to mess up the exam. Every final is 
supposed to be designed (according to those who call the signals) 
so that the average student can do all right, and yet it should 
weed the better students from the averageon a basis of all the 
work undertaken in the course.
But, back to what was travelling around this griping 
table. When our friends (the depressed students) went to 
see the instructors in question, they were given an honest 
and frank answer. I was too busy working on the final 
phase of the USSR Steel project to spend much time on the 
grades. And right here we have the source of most of the 
complaining against the graduate program at Tech.
In many phases of the life on this campus the relations be
tween undergraduates and graduates seem to be a little strained 
and much of this is due to the attitude discussed above. Until 
those engaged in graduate or other research learn not to neglect 
their duties to the undergraduates, such differences as the math 
department squabble of last semester will continue.
Although the revenue, and even the prestige, that comes 
from such work is much needed by the struggling professor, 
he must remember that each student is paying $340 per 
semester to get the best there is in a college education. 
Without even breaking down the various components of the 
tuition, it is obvious that each student deserves more than 
passing consideration in the classroom. If a professor is 
scheduled with an overloadthat is a problem for the ad
ministration to iron outbut the normal case is that the 
professor has a teaching schedule that should be easily , ac
commodated and merely gets too absorbed in his work to 
spend the required time outside the classroom. It is defi
nitely up to the administration to be sure that every man 
who instructs in a classroom is well aware of his responsi
bility and obligations.
^jhe Oblongata, f-^aperi
Plan That Failed
Translated from the Original Urdu by R. Durstine
,Once upon a time in a far away land 
there lived a man with an idea. This in 
itself is not particularly unusual, but it is 
important to mention that this was quite an 
unusual man, and his was a most extraor
dinary idea.
From youth this gentleman had been in
terested in education. By the age of 18 
months he had read all the weighty tomes in 
his fathers library (his father was librarian 
of Congress), and had composed three sym
phonies. By six years he had written 13 
books on wildlife in New Hampshire and the 
mating habits of the sponge (illustrated) 
and was international balkline billiards 
champion.
So it is rather evident that this young fel
low was destined for great things in life, judg
ing from the early start he got in several fields 
of endeavor.
With a childhood record such as this it is 
little wonder that he thought of many revo
lutionary innovations in almost every field 
imaginable. But among these there was one 
and only one that truly consumed his full 
efforts and desires. It was a plan for edu
cation, a plan destined to revolutionize the 
world (for a while).
So, despite his great potentialities as an 
author, composer, and pool hall loafer, he 
settled down to teaching history of the As
syrians in a small eastern college, and wait
ed his chance to make his mark on humanity.
This chance came when a chain of unusual 
circumstances (see TARTAN, January 13) 
lead to the destruction of all schedules and 
records of the school at which we worked. He 
jumped at the opportunity, conferred with the 
president of the college, and straightway the 
plan went into action.
The essence of it all was informality. Each 
student was required to learn exactly as 
much as he saw fit, and no more. And in 
turn each instructor was obliged to do only 
as much teachings as his students required 
of him.
Our friend figured that each student, 
spurred by his native curiosity and natural 
urge to learn would work to his utmost since 
he had only to work on those things that 
interested him. In the end, he calculated, 
everyone would be better off. Students would 
learn more, and not have a feeling of hav
ing been coerced into learning it; instruc
tors would be able to spend their full ef
forts on teaching those who wanted to learn 
and would not have to expend energy push
ing those who did not particularly care any
way.
But he had forgotten one great trutha 
truth which sort of threw a wrench into the 
works of his brainchild. He had forgotten 
that there is almost always a wide gap be
tween theory and practice; that people dont 
usually behave in a given manner just be
cause a sheet of paper ordains that they shall 
do so.
And thus the instinctive laziness of hu
mans took over. Male students decided they 
were most interested in beer, pretzels, and 
women, and hence spent their full time pur
suing these pleasures. Female students, on 
the other hand, preferred beer, cashew nuts, 
and men.
All of which left them without much of 
an education, at least not in the sense that 
the originator of the plan had hoped.
Needless to say there were a few who 
did take full advantage of the idea. But 
they were the sort that usually work to the 
utmost anyway. They were the ones for 
whom the plan had been originated. But 
unfortunately they were in a definite min
ority.
Finally the administration decided to go 
back to the old system, much to the chagrin 
of the students, who rather enjoyed the status 
quo for obvious reasons.
But the old method of education was rein
stated, and things came back to normal. And 
the only ones, who were really the worse 
for it were a few hundred students and the 
originator of the plan, who was so disap
pointed he went off to study the tribes of 
Borneo, and was eaten the next month in a 
tasty curry prepared by a faithful East In
dian housewife.

Swimmers Defeat Westminster 
To Gain Fifth Victory, 48-27
j A campus athletic team which 
has achieved little recognition 
irom Tech students in the past is 
the Carnegie Tech swimming 
squad. Yet the swimming team has 
eonsistenly made fine records, as 
evidenced by their 5-0 record for 
their current season.
Fifth Straight Win 
Last Saturday the Tartan mer men swamped Westminster, 48- 
27, at Westminster for their fifth 
straight victory. Westminster edg
ed out Techs 300 yard medley re
lay to set a pool record of 3:12.0. 
Wagner scored Westminsters oth
er two firsts in t hel20 yard in
dividual medley and the 200 yard 
breast stroke. Techg captain Dick 
Kramer and freshman Dan Guz 
also were double winners; cop^ ping the 220 and 440 yard free 
style and 60 and 100 yard dash 
events, respectively.
Coulter took the 200 yard back
stroke and the Tartans 400 yard 
relay team was victorious in the
final event of the meet to make 
the final score 48-27.
An Undefeated Season?
The big meets of the season for 
the Skibos will come this weekend, when they travel to Cleve
land to oppose Case Tech and 
Oberlin on successive afternoons. 
The boys seem to feel that if they 
can overcome these two formida
ble opponents, they will have a 
fine chance to finish the season 
undefeated, an improvement over 
last years 6-3 record.
The squad is also looking for
ward to the post-season PennOhio meet, in which the major 
tri-state area teams compete for 
the championship. Last year this 
was won by Carnegie Tech.
The results of the Westminster 
meet were as follows:

Final Quarter Surge 
Gives Tech 71-63 Win
by Jim Gore
Well it took a while, eight games to be exact, but the Tech 
Tartans finally won a game on their home court when they came 
from behind in the waning minutes of the contest to beat Case Tech 
of Cleveland 71-63. The win also broke a nine game losing streak 
which had the Plaid winless since#-----------------------------------------------------
the Bethany encounter Decem10.
There were only about 350 
staunch Tech fans at Skibo gym 
to witness the affair but those who 
oame were treated to an excellent 
exhibition.
Thrilling Ending 
The final period was a real 
thriller with the score being tied 
five different times before the 
Scots finally went into the lead 
62-60 on Doseys two pointer. Al
though Tech had a six point bulge 
at the half Case pulled past the j Hon 
Clan in the third quarter due 
mainly to a one man offensive by 
Ed Steigerwald who was high 
scorer for the evening with 19 
markers.
Pottmeyer and Craig 
For the Tartans Tom Craig 
again led the way but Ed Pott
meyer was only one point behind 
him with 12. In a fine show of 
team scoring Dosey, Thompson,
McGinnis and Mocker contribut- case Tech
ed another 37 points to the Plaid 
total.

Basketball Profile
Sophomore Phil Jeske 
Bolsters Tartan Cage Squad
by Jim Gore
Phil Jeske who hails from Fergeson, Missouri, is one of three 
sophomores, who have earned starting positions on this years Car
negie Tech varsity basketball team.
Phils basketball career commenced with his entrance into the
?fifth grade when he started to play 
for his public school team. When 
he entered Vogt junior high, Phil 
was playing guard and has con
tinued to play that position ever 
since.
Leading Scorer
At Fergeson high Phil partici
pated in a year of freshman ball 
and three of varsity. He was lead
ing team scorer several years with 
his class A squad. In his sen
ior year at high school, being top 
scorer in the point department, 
Phil was named as an all-league 
guard. In Missouri the high 
schools are divided into different 
leagues throughout the state so 
being picked all-league was quite 
an apcomplishment.
Only a Sophomore
When Phil came to Tech to 
study printing management he al
so tried out for frosh basketball. 
With his reliable style and high 
school experience he was not only 
able to make the freshman squad 
but also to participate in a few 
varsity contests.
Improving with every game, 
Phil, in his first season as a regu
lar varsity player, is showing the 
Plaid rooters some good ball.
Water Safety Course

Street scene m 1 ehachapi after last July's earthquake.
...EARTHQUAKE...
'v In the predawn of last July 21, the most 
severe California earthquake since 1906 struck 
the small town of Tehachapi.
Walls were collapsing, buildings were fold
ing. The towns telephone office shook to its 
foundation. But the night operator remained 
at her switchboard until it went dead. Main 
cables to the office were pulled to the ground 
when a nearby wall caved in.
This was at 4:50 A.M.
By 8:30 A.M. telephones were set up on the 
edge of town for use by the Red Cross and 
other emergency workers.
By late afternoon, the telephone switch
board was working. Tehachapi residents were 
able to contact friends and relatives concerned 
about their safety.
By 9 P.M. two TV stations were sending live 
telecasts of the damage. Telephone men had 
established a radio-relay system in less than 
12 hours.
It was a typical disaster  brutal and un
announced. But telephone men were prepared. 
They quickly restored communication when 
it was needed most. They demonstrated 
resourcefulness and technical skill typical of 
telephone people.
These are some of the qualities we seek in 
the college graduates we hire. Your Place* 
ment Officer can give you details about oppor
tunities for employment in the Bell System.

Sunday afternoon at the Student 
Council meeting, and had the 
poster ready for Monday nights 
registration.
would like the name of Mrs. Don Walker in preference to her own. 
The engagement was announced over the holidays. Now maybe 
Macella will abandon the idea of an engineering degree and worry 
about engineering a husband and*- 
home, which should prove more 
interesting. A date has not yet 
been announced.
Congratulations to Frank De 
Fazio who recently became the 
proud father of a bouncing baby 
girl.
Reports from the Phi Gamma 
Pi membership drive at registra
tion give an inkling of some new 
girls on the evening student cam
pus. Ever hear of Dona Walker,
Wilhelmina Schnarrenburger,
Charlotte Keller, Victoria Sabol,
Flora Byers, Matilda Bertovich,
Byrona May, and a few others 
whose names were not turned 
over to this reporter? Seems these 
girls are all awaiting invitations 
to the tea scheduled for Sunday 
February 15.

Spaghet^ Dinner
On Saturday January 31, Sigma 
Delta Phi enjoyed a spaghetti din
ner prepared by Social Chairman 
Tony Miscimarra. Although each 
person could have as much as he 
wanted, only a few were able to 
eat more than the one generous 
serving. It was rumored that one 
member asked for a third help

must have hid it some place and

He represented the citys point of

by Three Blind Mice
HOT TIME IN THE SCHOOL
. . . Ever notice the round radia
tors just inside the doors of In
dustries hall? Rumor has it that 
the radiators were designed with 
ft direct steam line from the boil
er room so that tardy students 
of the early days could be gently 
lowered into the center.
COMMITTEE ON BUILDINGS 
. . . Plans are under way to re
move a lar^e wall from the Exhi
bition Hall of the Fine Arts 
building in order to enlarge the 
capacity to handle the expected 
overflow of students auditioning 
for Scotch & Sodas 1953 produc
tion of Shoot the Works. Try
outs will be held February 14 
nd 21 from 1 to 5 p.m. in the 
enlarged (?) Exhibition hall.
MODERN MEDICINE . . . Re
cent studies have proved that a 
college fraternity man is in
stantly recognizable by his re
flexes: when he raises high his 
right arm, his mouth opens.
STUDIES IN HIGHER ELEC
TRONICS . . . Fellows now have 
no reason to visit Morewood for 
sorority rushing has so filled the 
lounge that the fellows cannot 
get near the prized TV set.
WELCOME ... A warm and 
hearty greeting is hereby ex
tended to the new students mak
ing their first appearance on Tech 
campus------You lucky kids!
ARBOR DAY . . . Everyday is 
Arbor day on the IA Building 
lawn. The latest additions are 
thorn trees ominously suggestive 
f medieval coercive methods.
DEAD NEWS . . . The local uni
versity hit the news again for its 
new student loan policy. It seems 
that since the wave of mass sui
cides by leaping from the higher 
floors of the cathedral, the stu
dent loan department now re
quires a student to insure his life 
tor the value of the loan.
PARTING THOUGHT ... Be
fore a wise man is rich enough to 
marry, a fool has children -old 
enough to support him.

GraduatesK Chances 
For Jobs Excellent
Charles E. Wangeman, head of the Placements Bureau, has an
nounced that there will be over two jobs available for every male 
graduate in the engineering and science fields. Carnegie will grad
uate 454 bachelor and 277 advance degree candidates fro mthe engi
neering, science and management^-----------------------------------------------------
programs on June 6.
Interview dates with 275 com
panies have already been sched
uled on the campus. Others are 
still negotiating for dates and the 
total may reach 325 before the 
end of the school year. Last spring 
315 business and industrial con
cerns recruited graduates here. 
Mr. Wangeman estimated that by 
June about 750 companies will 
have contacted Carnegie in hopes 
of employing graduating seniors.
Salary
The average monthly salary of
fered to male graduates with a 
Bachelor of Science degree is $350 
representing an increase of $25 
over last year*s figures. A man 
with a masters degree can expect 
about $390 a month, and one with 
a doctorate, a minimum of $515.
The trend in major companies 
with an eye to the future, Mr. 
Wangeman noted, seems to be a 
re-arrangement of their work assignments so that the few men 
available upon graduation are 
hired into positions which will 
utilize to the fullest extent their 
engineering and scientific back
grounds. The result is, he said, 
that women graduates and non
technical personnel will eventually 
have a better opportunity for less 
technical jobs normally given to 
young male graduates.
Picnic Sponsored 
By Senior Class
The seniors are again making 
plans for their annual picnic. This 
year it will be held on Sunday, 
February 15. The main lodge at 
South park has been reserved for 
the occasion.
In order to make sure everyone 
gets there, the drivers will meet at 
Moorewood at 2 p.m.
Mrs. Willey 
To Assist 
Womens Dean
Mrs. Calvin Willey, wife of Pro
fessor Willey of the mechanical 
engineering department, will as
sist Student Council and the of
fices of the Dean of Women and 
Dean of Men in planning and ad
ministering the student social pro
gram for the spring semester. The 
actual scheduling of social events 
will continue to be handled in the 
Dean of Womens office, as usual. 
Mrs. Willey will represent Carne
gie Institute of Technology at the 
all-school functions and other so
cial events.
Professor and Mrs. Willey are 
no strangers to the students so
cial scene for they have been ac
tive chaperones at individual par
ties for many years. Their interest 
and loyalty to the students in this 
area make them well qualified for 
this new official role. The Deans 
pointed out that with Mrs. Willeys 
assistance, they can be represent
ed more effectively in student so
cial functions both on and off cam
pus.
After Much Stir 
CFP Vote Decides: 
No King Campaign
After much _ stir and disagree
ment among those concerned, the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
has handed down its final ruling 
concerning the 1953 King of 
Hearts campaign. The resultno 
campaign.
In the voting, six groups oppos
ed the continuation of the King 
contest, four favored an unre
stricted campaign, one voted for 
simply a picture campaign, and 
one house abstained from the vot
ing.
It seems to be the consensus of 
opinion of the fraternity men op
posed to the campaign that the 
King of Hearts contest is little 
more than a lot of fuss over noth
ing, besides coming at a bad time 
of year, with mid-semester exams 
occurring at .the same time. All 
things considered, the majority 
just didnt feel the expense and 
effort to be justified.
Whether this is the final de
cision, or whether the issue will 
raise its head once again next year 
remains to be seen. It is quite pos
sible that the projects ^biggest 
booster, Mortar Board, might seek 
to resurrect it in the future.
