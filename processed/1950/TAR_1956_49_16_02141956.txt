Dean Edith Alexander 
'AnnouncesRetirement
After 37 years of service, Dean Edith Alexander is ending her 
administrative duties as Dean of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. 
In September, 1956 she will begin a two year leave of absence from 
Carnegie Tech, and when this leave of absence is completed, Dean 
Alexander will formally retire from her position.
However, her retirement will be* 
far from inactive because Mrs.
Alexander and her husband, Dr. 
rVThomas Alexander of Techs 
chemistry department, are plan
ning to -use this new leisure time 
for travel. Their itinerary will take 
them to parts of the United States 
and Europe which neither of them 
has seen before. Since Mr. and 
Mrs. Alexander will not be com
mitted to any scholastic schedules, 
all of their trips will take the form 
of extended vacations.
On Septembei 1, 1956, the Alex
anders will begin a motor trip 
Through the southern part of the 
United States which will take 
them to the Great Smokies, Sea 
Island, Georgia, and Florida. After 
a visit to Mexico, their next stop 
will be California. When all parts 
of this state have been visited, Mr. 
and Mrs. Alexander will motor 
across the country to Pittsburgh 
where they plan to make their 
permanent home. A freighter trip
the Scandinavian countries is 
e second big expedition which 
will begin in May, 1957. Norway, 
Sweden, Denmark, and Germany 
are the countries included in this 
journey.
To Visit Former Students 
On both these trips, visits to 
friends will maKe up a major part 
of the plans. Many graduates of

For Fall Semester
The fraternity and sorority scho
lastic averages for the fall semes
ter reveal that Alpha Tau Omega 
has replaced Tau Delta Phi as 
leader among the fraternities with 
a factor of 2.507 ^i Kappa Alpha 
retained second place with an av
erage of 2.486.
The sorority averages, always 
above the fraternities for some in
explicable reason, weTe unusually 
high this time. Delta Delta Delta 
was in the lead for the third con
secutive semester, this time with 
a 2.96. Every sorority, with the 
exception of the Tri-Delts, raised 
its factor, and the DGs and the 
Kappas tied for the biggest in
crease, .143. The all sorority aver
age was .28 above the all women 
average.
The all fraternity average was 
again practically identical with the 
all mens average. The ATOs 
showed the greatest gain over last 
semester, .180, and the Delts had 
the dubious honor of dropping the 
most, .351.

Rent Problem 
Puzzles CFP
To the satisfaction of all, the 
CFP formal was concluded with 
about one Hundred dollars of the 
budget unspent. Anyone at the 
dance would hardly have expect
ed it.
The new rushing policy expeimented with this month has been 
referred to the chapter meetings 
for discussion. At the next CFP 
meeting an attempt will be made 
to integrate the suggestions into 
future policy.
Fraternity rents# will increase 
next fall. While announcing this, 
the administration expressed its 
desire for fraternity opinion on 
how the increase should be levied. 
It is apparent that the magnitude 
of the rent raise is dependent up
on whether dormitory and/or 
commuter Greeks are considered 
liable.
A few articles back, the ad
ministration desired fraternity 
opinion on a rent increase to build 
up funds for the new fraternity 
dorms. CFP expressed its opinion 
after the usual chapter discus
sions, a preference for individual 
funds, which most chapters have 
had since the fraternity dormi
tory business started. There has 
been an obvious gap between fra[Continued on page 8]

Bill In Senate 
Increasing Korea 
Vets Allowances
By Bob Jack
It has recently been reported 
that there is a bill in committee in 
the U. S. Senate designed to in
crease training allowances to stu
dents studying under the Korean 
GI Bill. It is known as Senate 
Bill 2600 and has been introduced 
by Senator Kennedy of Massa
chusetts because of rising educa
tion costs throughout the nation. 
In the words of Senator Kennedy, 
Korean veterans presently en
rolled in institutions of higher 
learning should not be rewarded 
for their services to a lesser ex
tent than veterans who enrolled 
during the early days of the act.
If enacted, the bill is designed 
to increase benefits by 14 pff cent. 
This could compensate for the re
cent tuition increase here at Car
negie. The bill will go into effect

Kiltie Band Soloist
Among the outstanding features of the Kiltie Band Concert to
morrow evening will be a Mendelssohn piano concerto played by 
Robert G. Hamilton, a sophomore music major.* * * * * * Kiltie Band Gives 
Concert Tomorrow
The first Kiltie Band concert under the baton of new director 
George Reynolds will feature a premier performance of an operatic 
dance and a new bagpipe score composed especially for Carnegie
? Tech.
The traditional procession of
Panhell
Panhell Question Box will 
be held February 14, at 4:30 
in Porter Hall. All girls go
ing through rushing are urged 
to attend and bring along their 
questions which have arisen 
during the first week of rush
ing. Members of each sorority 
will be present to discuss in
formally the questions of 
sorority rushing.
ODK And Mortar Board Plan 
Revision Of Student Council
ODK and Mortar Board have been working on a plan for a 
new organization of Student Council. This plan will be presented 
for discussion at the next Leadership Conference on February 24 
and- 25. ?----------------------------------------------------
The suggestion is that Student 
Council should assume the form 
of the national government. The 
Executive branch would include, 
in addition to the president and 
vice president, twelve members 
who would act in a manner similar 
to the presidents cabinet. These 
members would be the presidents 
of the honoraries, Panhell, CFP, 
etc.
The Legislative branch would 
function as the Congress and 
would be divided into two houses.
The smaller of the two would have 
27 representatives, elected by the 
sororities, fraternities, and the 
men and womens dorms. The 
larger house would be elected by 
popular votethe nominees com
ing from the departments on a 
scale of 1 per 100.
Special Committees
Contained in this branch would 
be committees to study situations 
which arise and would be in need 
of governing laws. It has been 
suggested that there be two stand
ing committees, one for Homecom
ing and one for Spring Carnival.
In this way the non-sorority and 
non-fraternity students could take 
an active part in these weekends.
The third branch would be the 
Judiciary, with five or seven 
members nominated ana elected 
by the Legislature. No line has 
yet been drawn as to cases to be 
tried there and to which ones 
would fall tinder the responsibility 
of CFP or the Womens Dorm 
Council. A faculty member may 
also be included in this branch.
Brotherhood Week 
To Be Observed 
By Film And Radio
At Carnegie Tech, the Commit
tee on Religious Activities is 
sponsoring several programs in 
observance of Brotherhood Week. 
The films Boundary Lines, 
Brotherhood of Man, The Toymaker, and Picture in Your 
Mind will be shown to various 
groups. In cooperation with radio 
station WRCT,"two recorded dra
matic productions will be presented 
at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 19 
and Sunday, February 26, on the 
Sunday Chapel program. The 
titles o these p r o g a m s are 
One God and Echo of the Past. 
In addition, on Thursday, Febru
ary 23, there will be a panel dis
cussion by Tech faculty and stu
dents on problems of prejudice and 
understanding.
Week of Rededication
Brotherhood Week is sponsored 
nationally by the National Con
ference of Christians and Jews, 
and its purpose is three-fold: (1) 
To give people an opportunity to 
rededicate themselves as individ
uals to the basic ideals of respect 
for people and human rights which 
are essential to our way of life. 
(2) To dramatize the practical 
things which people can do to pro
mote an understanding ana real
ization of these ideals. (3) To enThe Executive branch, howev r,j hst the support of a large number 
.will act as mediator between the people in year-round activities
administration and .the council.
In drawing up these plans ODK 
and Mortar Board started from 
scratch in supposing that Tech did 
not have a Student Council and 
was in need of one. From there I brotherhood, 
they tried tor draw up a plan which j the beliefs 
they felt would be workable. I faith.
to build brotherhood.
This is not supposed to be the 
one week of the year most suited 
to the practice of brotherhood, but 
rather a time of renewal to sustain 
without modifying 
or loyalities of any
procession 
bagpipers in colorful Scottish eve
ning dress will march into Car
negie Music Hali at 8:15 Wednes
day evening, February 15, to open 
the concert and the 91-member 
band will strike up The Queens 
Own, famed* march used for 
Scottish military reviews. Rarely 
heard in this country, music for 
the Queens Own had to be pur
chased in Canada.
In a further salute to Scottish 
tradition, the Kilties will play 
The Thistle a medley of authen
tic Scottish airs, reels and 
strathspeys, and Tech Drums, 
written for Carnegie by pipe di
rector Lewis W. Davidson. 
Drums features 16 pipes and the 
drum corps.
Piano Concerto
One highlight in the concert will 
be a piano concerto featuring solo
ist Robert G. Hamilton. This is 
an innovation in Kiltie Bana con
certs and is highly unusual for 
band programming anywhere in 
the country. Music for this event 
will be Piano Concerto in G Min
or, 1st movement by Mendels
sohn.
Featured piece of the evening 
will be the premiere performance 
of La Calinda a Creole v. cddin^ 
dance from Delius opera Koanga. Band director Reynolds 
transcribed the music from its 
original orchestral setting to the 
band medium. A highly melodic 
and scintillating wedding dance, 
relying heavily on woodwinds, 
Reynolds transcription for the 
band attempts to maintain the 
original color and sparkle.
Tickets at Door
Included in the evening per
formance are also two original 
band works, Celebration Over

Human Muscles Under 
Study By Dr. Gregg
Electronics, already responsible for those modern computers ap
proximating some functions of the human brain, is now being em
ployed to determine motivation and proficiency in mans work and 
play.
An engineering psychologist at 
Tech, Dr. Lee Gregg, has devised 
an elaborate electronic instrument 
to measure the tiny voltages our 
muscles generate in moving. These 
voltages represent muscle tensions 
we develop accomplishing a par
ticular task. The tensions indicate 
the performers proficiency and 
also reflect his strength of mo
tivation.
When a subject performs cer
tain tasks, the electronic devices 
show to what extent each muscle 
is involved and in what sequence. 
This enables the observer to de
termine the proper distribution of 
muscle potentials for optimum 
performance.
The idea, Dr. Gregg states, is 
to get the right muscles to do the 
right things at the right time. It 
applies to putting a golf ball and 
belting a home run as well as run
ning a lathe or turning a screw
driver.
Industrial Applications
Dr. Gregg is now carrying out 
experiments to determine various 
industrial task requirements so 
that more adequate training pro
cedures for motor skills can be 
formulated, thus saving much 
wasted time, motion, and expense.
The muscle action potentials are 
used also to measure motivation. 
When the subject tries harder in 
performing a task, all the muscle 
areas being tested rise in tension. 
When he is lackadaisical about the 
task, the recorded tension is low. 
By introducing hypothetical mo
tivating factors, and recording the 
respondents muscle tension, the 
psychologist can determine which 
factors actually do motivate bet
ter performance. These experi
ments are aimed at discovering 
values of praise or reproof, knowl
edge of results and other incen
tives for industrial workers.
An electrical engineer as well as 
psychologist, Dr. Gregg is work
ing under a National Science 
Foundation grant.
Berlin Of 1955\Examined In New 
Readable Book
By Grace McAllister
Ewan Butler presents a very 
readable account of life in pres
ent Berlin in his book City Divide 
ed: Berlin 1955. The author first 
conjectured the plight of London
ers if their city had been divided 
into occupation zones following 
the war. This is followed by a 
brief history of Prussia and Berlin, 
but the largest part of the book 
deals with the description of life 
in the Western Sector of Berlin. 
The night life, new buildings, the 
family circle, and the skirmishes 
with the Reds are all presented to 
the reader in a style which enter
tains, more than cultivates, med
itation. There is no discussion of 
the political importance of Ger
many or the economic and political 
problems of maintaining Berlin as 
an island of the West in the Red 
Zone of Germany.
City Divided gives a travelogue
view of the city which has remain
ed internationally important and 
of the adjustments Berliners have 
made to the devastations of war 
and the division of their city. The 
author presents a very charming 
Berlin whose troubles are minim
ized to daily incidents. The book 
is interesting light reading and 
can be found on the New Book 
Shelf in the Main Library. City 
Divided: Berlin 1955 was publish-* 
ed by Frederick A. Praegeiv New 
York, in 1955.
Weary Students 
Plague Instructors 
During Hell Weeks
By Fay Fisher -
One of the many problems with 
which CFP has been concerned 
recently is'that of the* possibility 
of establishing a common Hell 
Week. Tentatively, each group de
termines its own dates for pledge 
projects as well as for Hell Week 
in order that the specific rules and 
commitments of each fraternity 
might be better realized.
As a result of personal choice, 
Hell Weeks have been observed at 
so many different times that an 
extra burden has been placed 
upon many instructors who must 
cope with absenteeism, test sched
uling, and weasy students over a 
longer period than seems neces
sary. Some feel that for the good 
of the men involved as well as 
their classmates one particular
week should be designated for this 
type of activity. Unfortunately, 
the possibility of an alteration in 
the current system has met with 
defeat.
Individuality Preferred
The chief reasons that CFP feels 
that a change could not at present 
be manifested are: that some fra
ternities desire to keep the date 
for Hell Week a secret, some 
pledges may not complete their 
pledge projects if Hell Week start
ed on a given day, and some fra
ternities feel it is more convenient 
to begin their programs during 
vacation, while others choose to 
start their rituals with the' new 
semester.
While redecoration,.landscaping, 
study programs, charity work, and 
modified physical hazing, such as 
extended hikes and nights without 
sleep, will continue for the re
mainder of this year unchanged, 
perhaps in the future an answer 
to the problem will be formulated 
which will be satisfactory to all 
concerned (except, of course, the 
pledges).

S n S In Need 
Of More Workers 
For 1956 Revue
By Bob Smith
On Sunday, February 5, Scotch 
and Soda held the first open group 
meeting in which the general stu
dent body had an opportunity to 
volunteer for work in the forth
coming production, Head Over 
Heels. The turnout was good and 
the first group of students wanting 
to participate in the show seemed 
very eager and ready to begin 
work.
The president of the club, John 
Drgon, made a short introductory 
speech, telling about the aims and 
background of the club. Then he 
introduced heads of the various 
departmentscostume and set de
signers, technical, publicity and 
business managerswho told what 
they needed and wanted from the 
students who would work with 
them.
The following Saturday was 
the first day of auditions, and 
again the turnout was good and 
the students interested in their 
work. But Scotch and Soda still 
needs people and a great many 
of them. The work in the final | 
prodution is enormous and the 
number of people signed up so 
far is insufficient to do the work.
So again Scotch and Soda urges j 
everyone on campus who is inter- j 
ested in doing anything for th 
show to come and sign up Sat- I 
urday, February 18. There is a 
need for people who can sew, 
paint or just pound a nail. Chorus 
members and dancers, especially j 
male students, are also needed. ! 
Remember Saturday is the last 
opportunity to try out for the cast { 
of Head Over Heels, for rehearsals ! 
begin a few weeks later. Scotch 
and Soda must have the support 
of the students in order to be a 
success.

Thriller The Jest 
At The Playhouse
If its exciting theater you like, 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse is the 
spot for you during the next few } 
weeks. Playhouse Director Fred
erick Burleigh is currently featur
ing the roaring adventure thriller. 
The Jest. The Jest is a throwback 
to the blood and guts school of 
the theater, the type of theater 
that made the mothers and fathers 
of today thrill to the swashbuck
ling hokum that was the theater 
of yesteryear.
The play is set in Florence, Italy 
during the time of the Medicis and f 
deals with a young painter who is 
badgered by a sadistic soldier and 
his henchmen. The artist gets his 
revenge by paying back his ene
mies for their inhumanities and 
reclaiming his fiancee whom they 
stole.
The cast is headed by Thomas 
Gaydos as the painter, John Johns 
as his adversary, and Gloria Abdou as the fiancee. The run of 
The Jest is definitely limited and I 
will continue through February 
25. Tickets for the entire run are 
now on sale at the Playhouse boxoffice.
The next Playhouse production 
will be the delightful comedy, 
Mornings At Seven, which will 
open in the Playhouses Hamlet 
Street Theater on February 16.

FAMOUS LAW CASES: NO. 1GRANSMIRE 
vs. MIDDLE ATLANTIC BUS AND DRAY CO.
(J, Gransmire, the plaintiff in this celebrated case, lived with his 
daughter Ernest and a canary named Whirlaway on Elm Street 
in Cooch, Delaware. The Middle Atlantic Bus and Dray Co. 
started operating a bus line on Elm Street. The passing buses 
caused a cut-glass chandelier in the Gransmires living room 
to begin tinkling. The chandelier tinkled in the key of E-flat. 
This so unnerved the canary, Whirlaway, whose key was Csharp, that the poor bird moulted out of season, caught a chill, 
and died untimely.
Ernest, Gransmires daughter, was herself so unsettled by 
the death of the canary that she flunked her final exams at the
^ Boars Head Beauty and Barber College, where she had been a 
promising student, majoring in bangs. Now removed, willynilly, from the skilled labor market, Ernest found work carryr 
ing a sandwich sign for the old Vienna Chow Mein parlor.
Here she met a bus-boy named Crunch Sigafoos. Although 
Crunch was not especially attractive  he had, for one thing, a 
large bushy tail  he was always clean and neat and kept his 
W shoes shined, and after a decent interval, he and Ernest were 
married.
Ernest soon learned that Crunchs large bushy tail was not 
as ariomalous as she had supposed: Crunch was a werewolf. 
After a while Ernest got sick of staying home at night while 
her husband went prowling about, so she asked him to change 
her into a werewolf too, which he did with an ancient Transyl
vanian incantation. Then, together, the two of them would 
lope out each night and meet a lot of other werewolves and 
maybe kill a few chickens or hear some book reports or just 
lay around and shoot the breeze.
Meanwhile, Ernest and Crunchs landlady, a miser named 
Mrs. Augenblick, notked that Ernest and Crunch never used 
their room at night, s^phe, in her greed, started renting it to 
transients. One night a Mr. Ffolliett stayed there. In the morn
ing while brushing his hair, he took a bottle that looked like 
hair tonic out of the cabinet, poured some, and rubbed it 
vigorously into his scalp. Unfortunately, it was not hair tonic, 
but a bottle of glue which Ernest had bought to mend a model 
airplane that Crunch had given her for their paper wedding 
anniversary. , I As a result of Mr. Ffollietts grisly error, he was unable 
to remove his hat and was, therefore, barred from his usual 
occupation which was lecturing to womens clubs. He sued Mrs. 
Augenblick, who sued Ernest, who went to her father, who sued 
the Middle Atlantic Bus and Dray Co. who had started the whole 
horrid chain of events.
Ladies and gentlemen," said the defense attorney in his 
opening address, this case, though very ramified, is covered 
by law. Indeed, every facet of life is covered by law. Law 
governs the homes you live in, the cars you drive, the food you 
eat. Even the cigarette you smoke is strictly regulated in its purC! ity and uniformity. The gentleness, however, is Philip Morriss 
own idea. Out of their vast experience as tobacco people, out 
of their profound regard for the astuteness of your palate, 
the makers of Philip Morris have evolved a gentle, new cigarette, 
with a taste as mild as a May morn, as subtle as gossamer, as 
welcome as money from home. I thank you.
Whereupon everybody rushed to the tobacco counter to buy 
bright red, white and gold packs of Philip Morris and were all 
rendered so amiable after a few gentle puffs that the whole 
complicated case was dropped. This later became known as the 
Delaware Water Gap. Mx a,,i|im*n- ws*

case on our new, gentle cigarette in our new, smart pack.

ing salt, rythmic stresses of gears, 
photographs of the moon, Orion, 
and other heavenly bodies are on 
display in the Hewlett Room in 
the College of Fine Arts.
Dipping into the resources of 
several sciences, the painting and 
design department is displaying an 
unusual collection of microphoto
graphs and telephotos.
Highlighting the show are the 
paintings of Robert F. Mehl, Di
rector of the Metals Research Lab
oratory and Dean of Graduate 
Studies, and Russell Twiggs, a 
member of the Fine Arts staff.
Dr. Mehls painting was in
spired by a photomicrograph 
which is included in the show. 
The painting was a cover ilustration for a recent issue of Metal 
Progress magazine. The Twiggs 
painting, though not directly de
rived from scientific photography, 
is nevertheless related to the 75 
photos on display.
New vistas opened through mod
ern- science form the general 
theme of the exhibit. The exhibi
tion is open to the public from 
nine oclock in the morning until 
five in the afternoon every day 
except Sundays through February 
16.
The next display in the Hewlett 
Room will be ar. exhibition of con
temporary American etchings, 
lithographs, and wood cuts. The 
show is scheduled tentatively for 
late February and will extend to 
the middle of March.

EditorialRent Controversy
OTCOURSE, WE WANT EVERYTHING- RUM IN 
A DEMOCRATIC FA5HION. 50 I'VET DEMO
CRATICALLY DECIDED THAT YOU'LL PAY. YOU MAY 
DEMOCRATICALLY DECIDE HOW MUCH7
Ever since the school first mentioned the 
idea of fraternity dormitory housing, there 
have been misunderstandings cropping up 
between the fraternities and the administra
tion. Now that one unit is well under way, 
the arguments about facilities have neces
sarily abated, but there is still controversy 
about the financial end of the deal. The cur
rent argument arises from the fact that be
ginning next fall, each fraternity man, 
whether a dorm or a house resident, will be 
required to pay a certain sum to the school, 
in addition to the normal rent fee.
The reason for this charge is to help to 
equalize the financial obligations of every fra
ternity. The occupants of the new unit to be 
completed in the fall, Delta Upsilon and Beta 
Theta Pi, will have to pay approximately $65 
per year more rent, and members of these fra
ternities who live in the dorms will be assessed 
a fee of $35 per year. This latter fee was deemed necessary on 
the basis that the dorm men will have the use of all the social 
areas in the new houses, and so they might as well help pay for 
them. This would also help to equalize the costs of dorm and 
fraternity unit residence, so that fraternity men would not pre
fer to live in the dorm to save a few dollars.
Therefore, the administration committee, composed of 
Dr. Miner, Mr. Patton, Mr. Miller, et al., reasoned that these 
two fraternities would be at a definite financial disadvantage, 
compared with those who were still firmly ensconced in their 
present mansions. This fact might also have hurt their rush
ing chances, despite the fact that they would have a new 
house to show off.
So, it was decided to assess the other fraternities. The 
funds assessed will be applied to the fraternitys account with 
the school, and are applicable to payment on new housing 
if and when that fraternity enters.
Several weeks ago, this was all explained at a CFP meet
ing, and it was left up to the fraternities to decide upon the 
per capita amount of the assessment. Since the exact presen
tation was not in writing, misunderstanding arose, and the fra
ternity men thought their choice was whether or not they wanted 
to pay anything, and if so, how much. After discussion in ehapter 
meetings, the presidents council calmly decided not to pay a 
cent. Almost all fraternities have their own saving plans for 
collecting funds for the time when they will need new housing, 
and it was felt that anything additional would be an unnecessary 
burden.
However, at the last meeting, it was obvious that there 
will be some sort of assessment, whether the fraternities 
are willing or unwilling. As usual, there is nothing in writ
ing, possibly because the ruling is not yet definite. It seems 
as though written proposals or statements of policy from 
the school would minimize misunderstanding in the future.
Regardless of the method of presentation, disagreement over 
this plan would still have existed. It is taxation without repre
sentation in the sight of most fraternity men. Their idea is: 
why should they have to pay something extra when they already 
are savins' under their own program? Of course the DUs and 
Betas will pay more rent, but they will already have made the 
down payment on house and furnishings by the time they have 
moved in, and they will not be saving for those purposes, as 
the others are.
Therefore it would seem grossly unfair to force all, even 
those who own their own houses and are not desirous of 
entering new units, to pay a certain fee. The new proposal 
pending in CFP is to let each chapter determine the addi
tional amount it wants to pay to the school yearly. This 
is the most agreeable plan from the fraternity viewpoint, if 
there must be any payments at all.
Another factor in many cases is the fact that a fraternity 
has a perfectly good house at present and doesnt warft to enCFP
?

ter the new plan for at least ten or 15 years. 
This is perfecty permissable, and contrary to 
some opinion, no one is going to be forced 
out of a good solid house. This group would 
want to save funds for that future time, but 
not at such a high rate, because by that dis
tant time of new housing, whenever it may be, 
their account with the school will be much 
larger than at present, just due to the accumu
lation of normal rent fees.
One final case is that of a fraternity 
which needs new housing but has ideas of 
building its own. It has been suggested that 
some group might profitably undertake a 
survey of property and housing costs in this 
area to determine the feasibility of this plan. 
But an obvious disadvantage of this would 
be the burden of a huge yearly property 
tax on a privately owned new fraternity 
building.
Over The Skibo Table

The Truman Memoirs which are being run as a 
series in Life magazine are the subject of a great 
controversy. Mr. Truman is receiving rebuttals and 
praise from all sectors of our country, and these, 
along with an article by General MacArthur de
fending his dismissal, are also being published by 
Life. Who is right and who is wrong is a matter of 
opinion, but I certainly would like to see an un
biased reporter present the facts to the public.

Head Over Heels, the new Scotch and Soda 
production, is getting under way with auditions be
ing given in the Fine Arts building on Saturday 
afternoon. S&S is being staged on the round stage 
this year. -That is to say, instead of staging the 
play on the gym stage as has been done in past 
years, John Drgon and crew will stage this years 
revierw on a round stage set up in the center of 
the gym floor. This gives everyone an equal view 
of the performance with the furthest seat in the 
audience being nine rows back. Anyone interested 
in S&S is urged to audition.

Inquiring Reporter
by Sally Day
With the coming of the second semesteT the 
sororities start the big spring rushing. One can^ 
not help but notice rushing activity around the 
campus. Skibo is packed with girls every after
noon, and Morewood Gardens is a madhouse at 
mealtime. Many things both good and bad, are 
to be said about our rushing system. Therefore, 
the Tartan felt that it would provide a place for 
these things to be said.
Barb Meyers, sophomore, secretarialThe main 
thing to which I object is the booking up solid, of 
a rushee by one sorority. This does not give the 
rushee a chance to meet other sororities. On tha 
whole, the rushing this season seems to be running' 
pretty smoothly. However, I think it is more cut
throat than before. I also would be in favor of a 
shorter rushing period because most of the girls, 
with the exception of the commuters, know each 
other by this time.
Carol Hlin, junior, secretarialI enjoy rushing, 
but it is so much work. This time of the year is 
quite busy even without sorority rushing. The 
rushing period affords the girls a good time in 
which to meet each other. I definitely do not bke^ 
the idea of rushing madly around on Thursday 
afternoons for dates. It seems ridiculous, and I 
wish something could be done about it.
Betsy Kuhn, junior, EnglishIn the past not too 
many girls have been left out by the sororities. 
There is usually a group for every girl. We on 
Panhell are trying to work out a system that will 
include more girls. I think most sprorities try to 
keep girls from being hurt by various methods. 
Also, the rushees are given three choices. If a 
rushee does not get her first choice, she is reason
ably certain of getting her second or third choice.
Betty Erwin, freshman, home economicsI think 
sorority rushing is a wonderful experienceone 
which will be long-remembered. It is faster and 
more hectic than I expected. Rushing is a terrific 
strain, but I cannot see any other way. One thing 
for which I am very glad is that the rushing period 
is in the spring. By this time the freshman can 
get to know the sorority girls' and the freshmen 
girls who might someday be in their pledge class.
I think that this helps the rushee to be more, 
certain of her choice.
Donna Albertson, sophomore, secretarialOn the 
whole, rushing is good and not too cutthroat. But,
I think the three-week period is too long. I am 
also against the mad dash for dates on Thurs
day at 4:30. Maybe the asking for dates period 
I could be staggered a little.
Mary Langdon, senior, general studiesAs Rush 
Chairman of Panhell, I am well acquainted with 
the rushing system. Panhell recognizes the draw
backs, but feels that this system is the best that.* 
can be offered at the present time. Suggestions i 
have been made that we do our rushing like the 
fraternities do theirs. I dont see how this can be 
done because, unlike the fraternities, we have a limit 
to our membership. This limit prevents us from 
open bidding. The lack or sorority houses also caus
es our system to be different. Because we do not 
have houses we have to use luncheon and dinner 
dates and parties in which to meet the rushees. It 
has been suggested that the number of dates which 
a rushee may make with one sorority be imited.- 
This system, however, places too much responsibility * 
upon the rushee.

Skibos Drop Close Battles 
With Duquesne and Geneva
The Tartans of Carnegie Tech went down fighting to defeat at# 
^he hands of the blyffites of Duquesne in what was probably the 
Roughest game of the season thus far. The final score was 69-59 
and a look at the box score will tell you that there were a lot of 
penalties administered by the offi-* 
cials. Both teams scored more 
points at the charity line than 
from the field and likewise both 
teams lost the services of three 
starters late in the second half be
cause of the rule allowing each 
player only five personal fouls.
Both teams made it quite evi
dent from the start that this was 
lining to be no tea party for the 
opposition. The Dukes All-Ameri
can Si Green passed up a lot of 
his shots because the. Tartan de
fense was all over him. However, 
he always managed to come down 
with the rebounds when the Dukes 
needed them the most. Mickey 
Winograd was high man for the 
Dukes with 20 and Si Green was 
second with 16 points.
Ralph Mocker lead the Skibo 
Quintet with 15, and Sobolewski 
and Boyd were second and third 
with 12 and 11 respectively. The 
Tartan had four men in the double 
figures to only three men for the
Boyd scores two for Tech while 
Si Green looks on.

boys from the Bluff. Techs hoopsters showed the boys that they 
meant serious business and could, 
take as well as dish out the rough 
stuff. The result was that the Tar
tans took a four point margin to 
the dressing room is they led at 
half-time, 30-34.
At the start of the second half, 
the Dukes made quick work of 
narrowing the gap and a. lay up 
by Ricketts put them ahead 36-35, 
after which the Tartans never 
gained back the lead. But they 
made it tough enough that the 
Dukes were never out of danger.

-The Tartans traveled to Beaver 
Falls this weekend to try to break 
the home court winning streak of 
Geneva. Although they did not re
turn with the desired victory, the 
Skibo quintet managed to turn in 
a thrilling performance before a 
capacity crowd of some 1900 peo
ple in the Beaver Falls High School 
Gym.
Tech was ahead only once in 
the entire game and that was mid
way in the second half when they 
were ahead by one point for only 
a few short seconds. The Tartans 
were ' down by as much as 11 
points once in the game, and most 
of the time they kept the score 
close enough to keep the Covies 
sweating to keep the lead.
Jim Boyd was tied for the total 
point honors with Woodeshick at 
19. Ralph Mocker was second high 
for the Tartans with 17. Ralph 
turned on a last quarter spurt in 
which he sank five set shots to lead 
a rally with seven minutes left in 
the game. Tension rose and by 
the time there were just two and 
a half minutes left, the Tartans 
were down two with the score 
68-66.
Alan Frank sank two free 
throws and this again brought the 
difference to two points, after Ge
neva had scored a couple. Then 
with 15 seconds left in the game 
Otto Pritchard dropped a charity 
toss through the hoop to give Ge
neva its winning margin. At this
time Tech was down three but 
they managed to sink one more 
from the field before the final 
buzzer sounded.

Mark With Leagues Unsettled
Several very close games high
lighted this weeks busy schedule, 
but the front-runners kept the po
sitions that they held last week.
In the Tech League, ATO A 
took the lead with two victories, 
over TX A, 49-35, and the Frothingslosh Five, 38-22, but the foamy 
boys are still in strong contention. 
The Delts, Englishmen, and BSR 
remained on top of the Skibo 
League with easy victories, but 
this condition will not continue, 
as BSR soon plays the Delts. The 
Kiltie League action found KS 
downing the Grad Iggles, 47-22, 
and the House of Harold beating 
BSR B by 31-21. In the Plaid 
League, the Rockets topped PKA, 
58-21, to widen their lead. The 
Scot League had a very tight game 
between SN A and BTP A, 
with SI" winning, 42-41. In the 
Tartan League, the Trojans topped 
PK A by 50-49.
The present situation of sev
eral teams tied for the lead in 
most leagues will soon be rem
edied, as the leaders are about to 
clash.

Night School Problem Recalls 
^ takes pear e^s Famous Question
To Be Or Not To Be was Shakespeares question but TV or 
not TV is the question now before us. We will not and can not take 
sides and so we must write the pros and cons. In case some of you 
are wondering what this is about we shall explain. There is a 
present problem of whether or not 
to buy a television set for use at

Confusion Reigns 
In Night School 
Registration Lines
It is registration night January 
31 or February 1, 1956, but per
haps it should be called confusion 
night. As you enter you get a 
handful of cards and papers and, 
with a dumbfounded look at them, 
start slowly walking away trying 
to decide whether to sit down at 
one of the many already crowded 
tables or get into one of the long 
lines of those standing. You get 
that settled and start moving only 
to be stopped again just when you 
feel that at least you know in 
which direction to go. About an 
hour of this stop and go and you 
finally step outside and breathe a 
sigh of relief because it is all over 
now and it didnt even hurt  
well, not physically, but the pocketbook hurts. Youve got an empty
Please!
Time and again requests 
have been made for articles 
to be used in The Plaid. Any 
organization having a meet
ing, has only to drop a few 
lines into the school mail box 
and the staff will see that 
your group gets publicity. 
Quite a few comments have 
been made about some groups 
getting a lot of publicity while 
others do not get any. If re
ports are not made about your 
meeting and the business dis
cussed, you, not the Plaid 
should be blamed for lack of 
publicity.

youve taken a step to a higher ed
ucation. So good luck  good

many social activities at the Union 
a4 waiting for the affair is some
times a problem. There is nothing 
to do until the other members ar
rive. Watching TV would alleviate 
the waiting. Mrs. Mercer and those 
staying or working at the Union 
would be able to enjoy the pleas
ures of TV which they are other
wise denied, since there is no set 
there at present. A set can be 
b(^pght at a very reasonable price 
and several have suggested deal
ers who could give a discount.
Those against having a set in 
the Union do not spend any extra 
time there outside of their meet
ings or socials so would have no 
use for it. Some think it would dis
tract the meetings since members 
would want to watch a favorite 
program rather than discuss the 
pi|j|>lems of the meeting. There 
would be the' danger of needed 
repairs and who would be respon
sible for the expense?
If you have an opinion in re
gard to this matter^ please write 
to the Plaid and we will present 
your answer. Sta e whether your 
name is to be published with your 
letter.
QJd Classmates 
Together Again 
At Registration
Registration night helps bring 
old friends together, even if only 
for a few short moments. During 
the walk from one table to the 
other until you finally are leaving, 
you are bound to see a few for
mer classmates, who may now be 
irksome other class, or perhaps 
someone who is now coming back 
to brush up on a subject or two. 
A few words here and there and 
you find the job of registering can 
be interesting too.
One of the youngest seen at the 
[registration was the baby of Mr. 
and Mrs. Ferguson who are P & D 
^students. Perhaps in 20 years Baby

Engineers in control room of one of eleven test cells

Andrew Willgoos Turbine Laboratory where jet engines and their components are explored. 
Cooling water from the Connecticut River can be pumped through a maze of conduits at 
the rate of 160,000 gallons per minute  3J4 times the consumption of a city of half 
a million people.
Located on the bank of the Connecticut River 
at East Hartford is a singular development facil
itythe Andrew Willgoos Turbine Laboratory. 
Here, behind windowless, thick concrete walls, 
many types of engineers find a never-ending 
challenge in the development and testing of 
advanced aircraft engines.
Test methods used by Pratt & Whitney Air
craft in their unique laboratory are highly com
plex. Tests are conducted on full-scale experi
mental engines at simulated altitudes up to 
76,000 feet. Extremely high speed airflow, with 
pressure and temperature accurately controlled, 
duplicates speeds as high as Mach 2.75. To re
produce such prodigious flight conditions, ex
traordinary equipment had to be devised. For 
example, a 21,500-hp driving dynamometer sup
plies the enormous power needed to test jet 
engine compressors over a range of speeds from 
800 rpm to 16,000 rpm.
The time lapse between development and 
production of new engines is reduced consider
ably by the advanced facilities of the Willgoos 
Laboratory. An outstanding example of results 
achieved through concentrated engineering ef
fort and complete research support is the Pratt 
& Whitney Aircraft J-57 turbojet. Today the 
unchallenged leader in its field, the J-57 is 
merely the forerunner of greater aircraft engines 
that will power the preeminent military and 
commercial aircraft of the future.

and each contestant may submit 
as many entries as she likes. 
Stories that have appeared in 
undergraduate publications are 
acceptable if they have not been
