5 Chest Goal 
Set For $4,500;
To Start Nov. 1
Carnegies Campus Chest pro
gram will get under way this year 
on Nov. 1. The Campus Chest, or
ganized a little over a year ago, 
takes the place of seven separate 
drives for funds. Since this cuts 
students soliciting to a minimum, 
the chest is asking for $1.50 per 
student to reach a $4500 goal.
The bulk of this total will be 
given to the Allegheny County 
Community Chest, which alone 
supports 92 organizations. Boys 
clubs, aid to the aged, community 
centers, and visiting nurses are 
only a few of the groups receiving 
aid from the community chest.
To help promote the Campus 
Chest, an outdoor entertainment 
is being p lanned by the executive 
committee the day before the be
ginning of the campaign. An allout campaign is expected to make 
the drive bigger and better than 
before.
This Thursday, Oct. 12, the Kil
tie Band will add color to Pitts 
inauguration of their campus chest 
to help them get an over-the-top
quota.
Student Council Makes Plans 
For Publishing Student Folder
Outline For Handbook Presented By PiDE; 
Interest In Transferable ID Cards Discussed
Plans for a student handbook containing information for mem
bers of all classes were brought to Council last Wednesday. Action 
on ID card use as a transferable ticket to sports events was again
postponed. -------------------------------------------
Lewis Sternberg presented Pi 
DEs outline of the handbook for 
Council approval. The booklet, 
containing information of value 
to all Carnegie students, will be 
presented informally. Six divi
sions will be included: activities, 
social events, campus publicity, 
sports, finances, and academic. .
Tells Where
The pamphlets main function 
will not be to give specific infor
mation, but rather to tell where 
to find it. Action on the project 
was postponed until Council pub
lications and budget chairmen 
meet with Sternberg.
Leonard Smollens proposal to 
use ID cards as tickets valid for 
non-students was again discussed.
The matter had been scheduled to 
go to the athletic committee, but 
due to the absence of Mr. Over
end, that group had not convened 
since the last council meeting.
Smollen stated that there is con
siderable campus interest on the 
subject, and prompt action is war
ranted.
Bulletin Boards
A1 Moore urged the purchase 
of two bulletin boards to an
nounce all school events. These 
boards, similar to the one at the 
entrance to the gym, would be 
placed at the end of the Cut and 
at Skibo.
In Moores opinion many cam
pus events are 50 percent failures 
partly because of inadequate pub
licity. Also announcements are 
lost among notices from other 
campus organizations. Action 
was postponed until more detailed 
information is obtained.
WRCT Plans 
Variety Show
Hidden Mike Program, 
Disc Show Featured
A variety show, a 20 Questions 
program, and The Vacuum 
Cleaner, a hidden mike program 
which picks up all the dirt on cam
pus, will be featured by WRCT, 
campus radio station, in its first 
week of broadcasting beginning 
Monday at 8:00 p. m.
Other shows include an hour of 
classical music and a disc jockey 
show on Dixieland jazz. Every 
night there will be a round-up of 
intra-mural sports and other CIT 
news.
There will also be three hours 
of canned shows every week. 
Shows to be heard will be by, 
Sammy Kaye, Tomy Dorsey, Harry 
James, Les Brown, and others like 
the Stars on Parade show.
Broadcasting is scheduled from 
8 to 11 every night from Monday 
through Thursday and originates 
in the studio in the basement of 
the Carnegie Union. The programs 
may be heard in Morewood Gar
dens and in most of the mens 
dorms. Eventually WRCT will 
also be made to cover the frater
nity houses.
Class of '53
The sophomore class has an
nounced its schedule for the 
year.
The first event will be a 
class assembly in the Little 
Theatre, Oct. 24, at 11:30. It is 
extremely important that all 
class members attend.
The schedule also calls for 
a class dance in Thistle Hall 
Nov. 17, and dances following 
the basketball games on Jan. 
6 and Feb. 10.
Any sophomores interested

Giant Pep Rally 
Scheduled; Purcell 
To Play At Dance
A giant pep rally in Skibo Bowl, 
preceded by a parade, will be one 
of the feature events of this year's 
Homecoming program. Council of 
Fraternity Presidents will also 
award a trophy to the fraternity 
pledge class which presents the 
best cheer at the pep rally.
The parade will form Friday 
evening at 6:45 in front of Fine 
Arts building and will proceed 
across the cut to Morewood Gar
dens and fraternity row. It wiil 
then swing up Forbes street, down 
Margaret Morrison street to the 
mens dorms, and into the Bowl.
As one of the main events of the 
pep rally, each fraternity's pledge 
class will present a cheer in com
petition for the annual pledge 
cheering trophy. The cheers will 
be judged on the basis of original
ity and performance. There wiil 
be a one minute time limit for each 
cheer, and a 15-man maximum 
team limit. There will be three 
judges, yet to be selected, to de
cide the winning pledge class.
This year, different from in past 
years, the trophies for house deco
rations and the pledge cheer will 
be awarded at halftime of the 
Carnegie-Case game, the climax *.o 
the 1950 Homecoming celebration.
John Elliot, alumni secretary 
and chairman of the committee 
handling the 50th anniversary 
dance, has announced that Jack 
Purcell will Rlay for the dance at 
the William Penn. Purcell is a 
Carnegie graduate and writer of 
Scotch and Soda productions in 
1940 and 1941.
While alumni will have to pay

School Spirit vs. Vandalism
The unfortunate incident of last Friday evening when 
a small group of Carnegie Tech students journeyed to Betha
ny College and succeeded in defacing property in a demon
stration that was suppose to display school spirit, brings 
up the question of where school spirit starts and ends.
School spirit stops at the point of defacing property and 
making enemies with other schools. At this point, the high 
school antics of supposedly mature college students becomes 
known as vandalism.
It is hard to figure out why college students, especially 
Carnegie Tech students, are unable to devise more ingenious 
outlets for their spirited emotions than resorting to the old 
conventional idea of painting up buildings and sidewalks. 
It is also disturbing when only a small group of students 
take it upon themselves to represent the entire school and 
then to proceed to do damagenot only to another schools 
property, but also to the name of Carnegie Tech.
Visits to other campus on the eve of football games are well 
and good; in fact, when drawing heavy student pa "nation 
they are the best way of drumming up spirit on both campuses. 
However, during the past few years, there have been no visits 
ot other schools by Carnegie Tech groups which have not been 
followed by telephone calls or letters to the Deans office regis
tering complaints over property damage.
Due to the fact that raiding student parties, like the 
one which visited Bethany last Friday night, usually re
main incognito and are beyond the reach of disciplinary ac
tion, the only practical solution to the problem would be 
for campus leaders to be on the alert for such demonstra
tions and forewarn students of their uselessness.
As an added thought we were wondering how many of the 
students who raided Bethany Friday night were cheering at Sat
urdays game; perhaps it might even be appropriate to ask how 
many were at the game?
Keep Up The Good Work
Hats off to Delta Skull, junior mens activities honorary 
for the fine work they have accomplished so far this year. 
On Student Councils frying pan last year for supposedly 
not functioning in any way that would call for its existence 
as a campus organization, Delta Skull has succeeded this 
year in becoming one of the most active service groups on 
campus.
Last Saturday they published the first printed program to be 
seen at a Carnegie Tech game since before the war; every in
dication is that this program will continue to improve. They 
have also undertaken the sponsorship of excursions to two way 
football games this fall.
Orchids and Onions
Orchids to the members of this years Homecoming 
Committee, who have been working hard in an effort to 
give students the best Homecoming week-end in many-a-year. 
Orchids also to the few administration members who have 
been cooperating in every way with the student committee.
Onions to the many other administration members who 
have considered the students as unimportant to Homecom
ing, and have done everything in their power to leave them ; 
out of this years 50th Anniversary celebration and Inaug
uration program.

Editor, the Tartan:
In the Inquiring Reporter 
(Oct. 3, 1950), there was an article 
about dramats. I think its nausiatingly disgusting to make drama 
students the object of malicious 
slander and libel, and to treat 
them as if they were people from 
a different planet. They are a 
minority, and because of this lack 
of power to fight back. (In my 
opinion, they dont even want to). 
But the fact still remains that stu
dents are sneering at them on 
every count.
A normal student might find it 
strange to see a couple of dra
mats talking lines out loud. And 
yet, isnt it funny when two en
gineers are in Skibo discussing a 
calculus or an algebra problem out 
loud? It is funny in that sense, but 
a dramat doesnt sneer or laugh 
because he has too much respect 
for engineershe doesnt say any
thing because hes matured.
A dramat has classes very often 
all morning, noon, and night till 
eleven or twelve. On top of that 
he has homework. Does it still 
seem strange to you normal peo
ple to see a dramat rehearsing 
lines while walking to or wait
ing for the next class? And dont 
forget, learning those lines is part 
of his assignment. What most peo
ple fail to realize is that the dra
mat at Carnegie is the hardest 
working and least appreciated stu
dent on campus.
Its true gome dramats think dif
ferently than other people. Some 
are more sensitive, more observ
ant, more alert than others. They 
have to be. It is their business, and 
it is as important to them as it is 
for a fish to be able to breathe un
derwater. But, too, youll find a 
great many of them regular guys 
and gals, finding time to see a 
game, or partake in a game, etc.
I will concede that some dra
mats, although very few, go a little 
too far and put on a too false air.
I find this to be disgusting, trite, 
conspicuous, and down-right sick
ening. But you mustnt forget for 
a second that you find that type 
of persons (?) in every walk of 
life. I have found them among en
gineers, architects; I have found 
them behind counters, in schools, 
on the street, and almost every
where I have gone. I dont respect 
those people one bit, and I have 
nothing but contempt for them;
but I do respect the business for 
taking them in; the most wonder
ful business in the worldshowbusiness!
Getting back to dramats, I think 
youll find, if you havent already, 
that they are the most interesting, 
colorful, and intelligent people in 
the world. (With exceptions, of 
course.) I might go so far as to say, 
and I would argue this point from 
now till the end of time, that with
out dramats, in one form or an
other, this would be a pretty dull 
and sorry world to live in.
Just remember one thing, you 
engineers and architects, and 
P&Ds, etc. . . . : There are all 
kinds of fish in the river. Dont 
make the dramats conspicuous in 
your conversations, in your writ
ings, in anything. And before you 
do another thing, get to know some 
of them. Talk to them. Youll find 
most of them to be completely op
posite of what you expected. Play 
fair with them, and theyll go more 
than half way with you . . .

In A RUT . . . The wide ditch 
leading from the parking lot on 
the cut is not a drainage ditch as 
some students suppose. It will be 
a cement walk running from the 
parking lot to the sidewalk in 
front of Webb Hall.
THEY CALL THIS WORK? . . . 
Exactly what were the engineers 
surveying by Margaret Morrison 
last Thursday? At first the girls 
thought the engineers were tak
ing dimensions of the building, but 
when they heard calls of, 34-25- 
35, they began to wonder. 
CALLING CHARLIE ... Does 
your hair have that washed-out, 
I - dont - give - a - darn look? It 
wouldnt, students, if you clip out 
the ad in the next Tartan issue on 
Wildroot Liquid Cream Shampoo 
and send it to the Wildroot Com
pany. Youll find youll have a 
hard time, Charlie, keeping all 
those girls away.
ON THE TOWN . . . Here is a 
great opportunity for journalistic 
geniuses. The magazine, Madem
oiselle, is opening a contest in or
der to find college board members 
for the publication. If you place on 
this board, you have the chance to 
be a guest editor of the magazine 
next August.
THE PENNSYLVANIANS . . .
When Dr. Miner was at Penn Stat 
for the inauguration last week, he 
spent some time with Fred Waring. 
Could it be an indication of bigger 
entertainers at Carnegie dances, 
hmm?
WHOS SORRY NOW . . . Sev
eral students have asked members 
of the Tartan staff who was re
sponsible for the fool question 
the inquiring reporter asked last 
week. It was little ole me.
EXTRA! . . . The volumes of 
strange literature on campus last 
week werent Communist propa 
ganda leaflets; they were Duquesne University newspapers. 
The University distributed about 
30,000 copies around Pittsburgh 
last week.
A THOUSAND THANKS . . . The
kitten and its mother who live in 
the pipe near the faculty club 
want to express their thanks to the 
humanitarian that put a saucer of 
milk by the Cut for them.
DOORS . . . Have you seen stu* 
dents go in and out of the door in 
Skibo that is across from the en

There is a practice theatre in there 
where drama students rehearse.

INQUIRING REPORTER
Survey Reveals Drama Students 
Know Where They Are Going
When last weeks Tartan was published, the inquiring reporter 
found that the campus views on dramats caused much discussion 
among the drama students. They felt that the question raised last 
week was not a reasonable one. Drama students definitely know 
where they are going. Here are^ 
a few of the ideas dramats offered 
to the inquiring reporter.

Square Dance 
To Benefit 
CARE Relief
All Carnegie Tech students are 
invited to a real hoe-down square 
dance Friday, Oct. 13, at 8 p. m. 
in the auditorium of the First Uni
tarian Church.
The square dance will feature 
two well-known Pittsburgh call
ers, Bob King and Irv Silverman. 
It is sponsored by th Tom Paine 
club for the benefit of the CARE 
book program.
Stan Watt, freshman: People
must remember 
that the freshm e n dramats, 
many of them, 
are away from 
home for the 
first time and 
some get car
ried away. A 
d r a m a t can 
either be crazy 
or not be crazy.
It depends on personality. Be
sides, there are eccentrics in every 
field, architecture, design and en
gineering.
John Ziselman, junior: A lot 
of people have

to note that last year the dramat 
softball team won the league cham
pionship; dramats have ability in 
that field also.
In some cases, drama students 
copy stars; that is true. But, 
there are also many rugged indi
vidualists who would not copy 
anybody professionally.

a few ways different from others. 
Perhaps we see things from a cul
tural viewpoint. I have not been 
and am not now a member of the 
communist party.
Helen Taylor, freshman: I
think, for one 
thing, that most 
people already 
anticipate 
something dif
ferent to be 
found in dra
mats and when 
they do find it, 
they accentuate 
this difference.
Possibly, dra
ma students do have a tendency 
to become so interested in their 
work, that they are not interested 
in other groups. There is some
thing understood among dramats. 
What they are doing is very im
portant to them; it is their life 
work. In many professions, the 
field of work is more or less in 
the background.
In the drama profession, the 
work is in the foreground all the 
time. It is not that drama stu
dents consciously ignore others; 
it is just that they seek out those 
who have an understanding of 
their work.
Alton Plischke, graduate: Ev
eryone devel
ops special pro
fessional skills.
One of the im
portant skills of 
the dramatic 
prof ession is 
that of exter
nalizing what 
is inherent in 
everyone. If a 
dramat seems 
different that is because he must 
develop a flexible externalization 
of his emotions and those of the 
characters he portrays. Dramats 
have learned to externalize emo
tions that most people suppress. 
It isnt necessary that most peo
ple extend their personality. For
merly, this dramatic ability was 
held in awe and respect. The 
theater must have a magical, big
ger than life quality. People in 
the theater seem to take on this 
quality from constantly working 
in that medium. Others sense 
this dramatic quality, that of ex
pressing emotionalism, and they 
call dramats different. They 
dont know how to express this 
feeling. If students will think of 
the word different in this light, 
in the sense that it is a word sig
nifying a quality that dramats 
must have in order to be success
ful; perhaps they will have a bet
ter understanding of the dramats. 
The dramats have set their aims 
and devote all their energy to
ward reaching their goal. They 
know where they are going.

Regardless of the sport that theyre coaching, the great 
majority of athletic coaches are in the habit of giving pre
season predictions that make the average person wonder 
whether the particular team will even be able to complete 
the schedule. When a coach gives even a small amount of 
encouragement, it is something worthy of note; but when 
a coach asserts that he has the best team that he has ever 
coached and that he is expecting a very good season, it is 
earth-shattering news.
Carnegie soccer coach Pat OConnor has come forth with 
the latter type of statement in predicting an exceptionally good 
season for the 1950 Tartan soccer team. For the first time in 
many years coach OConnor is not complaining because of lack 
of experience and ability among his charges. He has stated that 
he has the best soccer squad in his many years of coaching.
Once again it looks as though Carnegies athletic for
tunes are on the upgrade not only in football but other sports 
as well. Of course, in regard to soccer, only time and the 
breaks of the game will determine just how far the 19E50 
team will go. Saturday mornings home soccer opener 
against Frostburg State Teachers College will be the tipoff on just how good the team is, particularly in view of 
the fact that the visitors consistently boast an outstanding 
team. We sincerely hope that coach OConnor is correct in 
his predictions, for no one is more deserving of success than 
is the veteran Skibo mentor.
Cross Co unfry Outlook Good
Encouraging news is also forthcoming from another 
Carnegie sports front. Although cross country coach Guy 
Halferty has not been quite as definite as has OConnor, he 
does admit that the possibilities for a good season are better 
than usual. Off their pre-season performance against the 
Jeannette Harriers, consistently one of the best independent 
athletic organizations in the area, coach Halferty may have 
at his disposal a much better group of distance runners than 
he is willing to publicly admit.
Not only are veterans John Cooper and Bob Carmen back 
to pace the Tartan harriers, but also several freshman runners 
have given indication of providing the depth so necessary to 
success in the gruelling sport. Douglas, Draper, and Campbell, 
newcomers to the squad, placed first, fourth, and seventh, re
spectively, against Jeannette on Saturday, and could very easily 
give the team the extra push that has been lacking in the past 
few years.

Sigma Nu 66A" Victors Over Delta Upsilon;

An underrated Phi Kappa team threw the intramural football 
race in the Scottie League into a turmoil Friday as^they defeated 
a favored Sigma Nu B team by a 23-18 score.
The Phi Kaps jumped into a 12-6 first quarter lead on a reverse 
quarterback Tom^-

Sigma Nu scored on a pass from

the half.
Even Up
In the third quarter, the teams 
battled on even terms. Another 
DAgostino to Stroble pass tallied 
for the Phi Kaps and Sigma Nu 
scored on a pass from Warren to 
Holthaus. However, the Phi Kaps 
salted the game away in the last 
quarter as DAgostino completed 
again for five points, while Sigma 
Nu was being held to one lone

In the only other game played 
in the league, Neman tallied for 
Delta Upsilon as they led Sigma

Harriers Open 
Against Geneva
Rout Jeannette Team 
In Pre-Season Meet
Coach Guy Halfertys cross
country team will begin its 1950 
campaign against Geneva College 
at Beaver this Friday, Oct. 13. Al
though this will be the first regu
larly scheduled meet, Halferty is 
optimistic about his teams chances 
because of their pre-season per
formance against the Jeannette 
Harriers last Saturday.
The 22 man squad, captained by 
little John Cooper, rolled up a per
fect score, 15-40, over Jeannette 
along the gruelling 3.6 mile course 
in Schenley Park. This marked 
the first time in 15 years of friend
ly rivalry with Jeannete that the 
Tartan harriers have ever accom
plished this feat.
Carnegie easily captured the 
three places, with freshman Ar
chitect Douglas setting the pace in 
21 minutes, 31 seconds. Captain 
Johnny Coper finished second in 
21:48, and Bob Carmen followed 
closely on his heels in 21:52.
Six Tartan runners crossed the 
finish line before the first Jean
nette man finished in 23:19. Three 
Skibo runners, Carmen, Cooper, 
and Douglas, passed beneath the 
Panther Holiow bridge, which is 
about one-third of the way along 
the course, in seven and one-half 
minutes, the best time so far this 
year.
This result was a complete re
versal of last years meet when 
Jeannette captured the top three 
honors and won the closely con
tested meet 27-28.
Tartan Lineman Of The Week
In recognition of his tremendous 
performance, both offensively and 
defensively, against Bethany Col
lege last Saturday, the Tartan has 
named guard Floyd Wiseman as 
the recipient of its Lineman of the 
Week award.
Playing his fourth season for the 
Plaid, the hard-hitting, 190-pound 
Wiseman was most responsible for 
making the key blocks that gave 
the host of fleet Tartan backs an 
opportunity to break away for 
sizeable gains.
The gains off the weak side 
made by halfback Irv Shechter 
were largely due to Wisemans 
work up front.
Wiseman was also calling defen
sive signals during the early part 
of the game, and his vast football 
experience served him well in 
diagnosing and stopping the 
Bisons single-wing attack.
Floyd Wiseman
Lineman Of The Week
High-Scoring Zippers Capable 
Of Upsetting Undefeated Plaid
On Saturday the CIT gridmen will seek their third straight vic
tory in playing host to a strong aggregation from the University of 
Akron. The only other meeting of these two teams took place in 
1926, the Plaid winning by a 27-13 score.
------------------------------------------------? Having recovered from a 33-6
defeat last week at the hands of a 
much heavier Baldwin-Wallace 
squad, CoacfT Bud Houghton and 
his charges will be out to regain 
their winning ways at the expense 
of Dr. Bakers smaller squad.
Much Improved 
.. Although the Zips were only 
able to score two victories in the 
1949 season, they have given def
inite notice that they will be a 
much improved team this year. 
Two weeks ago they scored a 
smashing 40-7 victory over Mich
igan State Normal to show that 
they possess the ability to score 
their share of touchdowns.
The largest man on the squad is 
their 240-lb. tackle, George Mc
Donald, who has been a standout 
on the line for the Zippers all sea
son. Big George is just the man 
for the type of rock-em, sock-em 
game the visitors prefer to use.
Big Boys 
Close on the heels of McDonald 
is another tackle, Joe Petracca, 
who weights in at a mere 225-lb. 
This rugged lineman has been par
ticularly effective in leading in
terference for the Zips.
This years captain, and the AllOhio Conference choice for center 
last year, Tony Laterza, is one of 
those collegiate football raritiesa 
60-minute player.
Tougher Game 
In Fullback Tony Lionetti and 
Quarterback Regis Longville the 
Blue and Gold have two of the 
outstanding backs in the entire 
Ohio district.
This fighting group of gridders 
from the University of Akron is 
undoubtedly the strongest team 
that the Plaid has faced thus far, 
and it will also be the first game in 
which the Tartans have not been 
solid pregame' favorites.

Soccer Season Starts; 
Frostburg First Foe
Showing greater strength in the front ranks, as well as more 
plentiful and more experienced reserves, the Tartan soccer squad 
opens its 1950 campaign this Saturday morning as favorites against 
Frostburg State Teachers College. The game will be played on the 
Forbes street field. ?----------------------------------------------------
With two better than average 
goalies in Ward and Goldschmidt 
to spark the defense, the main 
problem of the Skibos will be that 
of offense. This burden will be 
carried by, Francis Jenkins, last 
years leading scorer, and the ag
gressive Bob Lipp and Jose 
Coelho at forwards.
Frosh Outstanding1 
Captain Jack Burrey and either 
Rudy Hribar or Walt Wagner will 
operate from the fullback posi
tions, with George Vlacos, Fred 
Richards, and George Bushey at 
halfbacks.
Several very promising new
comers will be giving these men 
a battle for their places in the 
lineup. Among these are Howard 
Phillips and Clark, two freshmen 
who have shown plenty of ability 
and appear to be sure letter-winners this season.
From Way South 
From Latin America come three 
others who can be counted on to 
make presence felt. Londono, 
Ungo, and Elquezabal have al
ready played a great deal of soc
cer and should prove valuable ad
ditions to the Tartan squad.
Although he has not had ade
quate opportunity to work his 
men into playing condition, coach 
Pat OConnor has predicted that 
this team will be one of the best 
he has ever coached. With so 
much strength and talent, they 
are picked to improve consider
ably last years record of four 
wins and four losses.

Marilyn Protes, freshman, was

The club also has arranged a 
game between the freshmen and 
the upperclassmen for Thursday, 
Oct. 12, at 4:30 p.m. on the Cut. 
Upperclassmen and freshmen are 
urged to turn out and cheer their 
respective teams.
Sports Meeting
There will be a pep rally 
before the Akron game this 
week. The parade will start 
in front of the gym at 7:00 
p.m. Friday and proceed 
across the Cut to Morewood 
Gardens and up Forbes street 
to the soccer field. All fresh
men will collect and bring 
firewood to the soccer field by 
6:00 p.m. Friday. Plan to bring 
noisemakers and torches.

Skibos Take Second Straight, 
Down Bethany Bisons, 34-3
Opponents Outclassed In Every Department; 
Luchok, Oberg, Wilson, And Leaman Score
The fighting Tartans took the Bethany Bisons in stride on Sat
urday and easily downed them 34-3. The Plaid outclassed their 
opponents in all departments.
Johnny Luchok, at left for the first time, showed good running
form as he scored two touchdowns 
and gained large chunks of yard
age. Dale Startzell and Jack Magnifico also hit the line for impor
tant gains.
After Revenge 
The Green and White started 
the game as though they meant to 
avenge last years bitter defeat as 
they drove to the Tartan 11 with 
the opening kick-off. The defense 
tightened with its back to the goal 
post and held for three downs. On 
the last one Tom Rozanski booted 
an 18 yard field goal.
After that the Skibo squad took 
command for the rest of the game. 
Jack Brourman took the kick-off 
and returned it from the 20 to the 
41. From there it took eight plays 
and four first downs to bring the 
ball to rest on the six yard line. 
Arnie Oberg crossed the goal on 
his second attempt, and Dissen 
converted to make the score 7-3. 
Smart Fumble 
The ball changed hands several 
times during the remainder of the 
quarter, but neither team was able 
to formulate a threat. Early in the 
second quarter though, Luchok 
broke off his right tackle and went 
67 yards for a tally. Again the 
conversion was good, and the 
score was 14-3.
A few minutes later, aided by a 
play in which they fumbled but 
recovered to gain 12 yards, the 
Skibos were threatening again. 
The Bisons managed to tighten 
their defense at the last minute 
and held on the one yard line.
Forced to punt from the end 
zone, Bethany found the Tartans 
back for another try on the next 
set of downs. This time they were 
successful as Quent Holtz threw a 
22 yard pass to Fritz Wilson for 
the score.
Another Interception 
The only substantial drive the 
Green and White managed to 
make in the second quarter was 
broken up by Gerry Blumfeldt as 
he intercepted one of Dan Altemeses passes.
The first half of the third quar
ter found a number of intercep
tions and fumbles, but neither 
team could capitalize on the 
breaks. With five minutes remain
ing in the period the Skibos began 
a long sustained drive.
They started on their own 19 
and nine plays later were on the 
opponents 6. Luchok tallied from 
their. Dissens fourth straight 
made the score 28-3.
Became Desperate 
Becoming desperate in the wan
ing minutes of the game, Bethany 
started throwing long passes. Ted 
Leaman managed to get his hands 
on one of them and carried it 52 
yards for a score. This time Dis
sens kick was wide to the right 
and the scoreboard read 34-3.
Hampered by numerous penal
ties, the Green and White did not 
get within the forty for the re
mainder of the fracas.

game as Sigma Nu was victorious,

Kappa Sigs Idle
The Dorm Dukes moved into 
first place in the Skibo League by 
virtue of a 14-3 win over the 
Newman Club, as Kappa Sigma, 
the only other undefeated team 
in the league, was idle. Dorm 
Dukes DeVos and McDaniel 
scored the games only markers.
Earlier in the week the New
man Club took it on the chin for 
the first time as the SAE squad 
KOd them by a 12-0 count. In 
the fourth quarter Bob Fahle tal
lied on a pass from Hunt for the 
victors as they came from be

protest. The game was forfeited 
to Alpha Tau Omega upon the

PiKA served notice as another 
formidable contender in the Kiltie

The pool was wet, the sophs 
were tough, so into the pool they 
went when they got too rough.

The Morewood girls, the freshmen

EditorialsWe Aim To Please
With the beginning of the new school year the Plaid wishes to 
welcome back its evening school readers, and the new editor would 
like to take this opportunity of expressing his earnestness in pre
senting the evening students with a fine and interesting paper. We 
realize that our predecessors have set the standards high and we 
will try hard to give our fellow students as good a paper as they 
have done. Of course the job of editing the paper does not neces
sarily fall solely on the shoulders of the editor and his staff, for the 
students still have the power to demand the kind of paper they want. 
This can be done in several ways. One of the most potent instruments 
is a Letter to the Editor addressed to the Plaid Editor, Box 256, 
suggesting the kind of news that should appear in the Plaid, or 
offering constructive criticism concerning the Plaid or any other or
ganization on campus. We will try to publish each and every letter 
and the advice offered will be sincerely considered by the person or 
group concerned.
An even more direct method would be to appear in person at 
the Plaid office on the third floor of the Carnegie Union, any Friday 
evening from 8:30 to 11:00 p. m. and help with the editing of the 
evening school paper.
The most helpful aid the evening students can give to the Plaid, 
and to Evening Student Council is to make it their aim to obtain and 
read each edition of the evening school paper. This can be done 
primarily by demanding that the paper be on hand in all buildings, 
on all class nights. If the student should fail to find papers at the 
entrance of the building in which he has his classes for that evening, 
he should immediately notify one of the Evening Student Council 
members and insist that the paper be on hand at the next class night. 
If the student fails to obtain a copy of the paper or fails to take 
an active interest in its contents then our work and sincerity is to 
no avail. 
In conclusion we would like to vehemently express again, our 
desire to serve and please the evening students, and we promise to 
attempt to make our evening school paper as fine as is possible under 
the conditions we have to meet.

Back to the old grind after what 
always seems to be a very short 
summer recess. It was short indeed 
for those hardy few who attend
ed summer session. Nevertheless a 
few weeks of rest will do wonders 
to renew the zest for learning.
Carnegie Techs new building 
program has brought changes ev
erywhere, most notable is the new 
Engineering Hall wing which is 
rapidly nearing completion. Vari
ous classrooms in other buildings, 
particularly in Industries Hall 
have been redecorated and remod
eled. Those who attend the Little 
Theatre will find a new stage 
lighting system, which will make 
the plays even more enjoyable.
Registration this year initiated 
the I.B.M. system into evening 
school. Although things might 
seem to be a bit complicated at 
first, the I.B.M. system will soon 
simplify the keeping of records, a 
fact already demonstrated by its 
effective use in day school the past 
year.
Incidentially we wish to extend 
congratulations, and a double hur
rah to the Hand Book editor Byron 
May and his assistant Miss Mar
tha Latza for the fine job they did 
in editing the Hand Book for this 
year.
The Pittsburgh Playhouse open
ed its seventeenth season on 
Thursday evening, Oct. 5th, with 
the Broadway Comedy Goodbye, 
My Fancy, featuring a cast of top 
Playhouse favorites under the di
rection of Frederick Burleigh.
To the many friends of Ray 
Schwalm popular evening school 
engineering student we would like 
to mention that Ray was called 
into the service, and will not be 
with us this year. Soon as we get 
his forwardig address we will 
publish it, and we hope his many 
friends will write to him.
To the evening students who 
have volunteered to distributed 
the Plaid, we would like to men
tion that the paper locker has been 
changed to locker number 3605 in 
Industries Hall, across the hall 
from the printing department 
plaque. See Frank Mihelich for the 
combination to the lock.
Student tickets for the Little 
Theatre play Liliom will soon be 
available in Mr. McKelways office 
132A IH. The play is to be held 
October 19-28.
Any evening student who wishes 
to help Evening Student Council 
with its plans for the coming 
Square Dance should contact

strom or his assistant Harry Lin

which was held Saturday evening,
Sept. 30. Another item of old busi
ness was the election of a new vicepresident. This office was vacant 
because of Mr. George Schussler 
being elevated to the office of pres
ident. President-elect Mr. Ray
mond Schwalm was called into the 
service. An item that had been 
heatedly argued at past council 
meetings and finally approved at 
this meeting was that a set of By 
Laws be added to the Evening 
Student Council constitution. The 
essence of these By Laws ap
proved by council was that spec
ific committees be formed with 
definite duties that would aid the 
council president in executing 
more effectively the administration 
of Evening Student Council. (Ed
itors Note: The Plaid will give a 
more detailed account of these 
committees in an early issue.)

ed, in-coming president George
