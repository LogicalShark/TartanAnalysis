Dr. Warner Is Appointed 
Advisory Counsel For AEC
Dr. John Christian Warner, president of Carnegie Tech, was 
apopinted to the general advisory committee for the Atomic Energy 
Commission last week. Former head of the CIT chemistry depart
ment, Dr. Warner served on the government staff during the war
and aided in the development of* 
the Manhattan Project.
It was a surprise to Dr. War
ner to receive the telegram from 
President Truman, because the 
new appointments were not to be 
released until later in the fall. He 
also serves on the Presidents Man
power Commission, which is con
cerned with the number of engineers and scientists available to 
the US today.
Leave of Absence 
A leave of absence from Carne
gie was granted Dr. Warner from 
1943-45 to serve on the Manhattan 
Project, which perfected the atom
ic bombs dropped on Japan. He 
helped bring about the purification 
of plutonium.
During this period he also was 
engaged as a research co-ordinator 
between several US colleges in
cluding the University of Califor
nia, the University of Chicago, 
Iowa State college, and the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology 
besides aiding the research pro
gram at the Los Alamos proving 
grounds in New Mexico.
In addition to these govern
mental positions, Dr. Warner is on 
the board of directors of Jones & 
Laughlin steel company and holds 
numerous civic offices.

General Science and Music will 
vote as a group to select two girls, 
because they are the smallest de
partments.
2. All the freshman women, after 
assembly in recreation hall, will 
go into various rooms where each 
department will select as many 
girls as their quota allows. As 
soon as this is done, everyone will

Plans Weekend
A spectacular homecoming 
weekend is being planned by 
Mortar Board, senior womens 
honorary, fov October 24-25. Many 
alumni return to Carnegie Tech 
each year and join the students 
in the weekend celebration. Out
standing improvements on the 
campus will undoubtedly interest 
a large number to attend this 
year.
The general co-chairmen of the 
weekend, Pat Miller and Norma 
Trust, have chosen Eunice Brunn

will be handled by Dottie Boarts.
An exciting part of the week
end will be the Forbes field foot
ball game with Case Institute of 
Technology.
Band Trip
Tech students will give their 
whole-hearted support to send 
our Kiltie band to the Bethany 
game. This is not a one way 
proposition since all CIT stu
dents buying tickets to the 
game will have reserved seats. 
Student Council is selling tick
ets at $1 per seat, of which 18 
cents goes for federal tax and 
the remaining 82 cents sup
ports the Kiltie bands trip.

The colorful Kiltie band will be seen during half time at all

that suitable arrangements could be made to appear at both home
and away games. The Kiwanis club of Wellsburg, W. Va., where j First Production

Sorority Rushing Rules
The following are rushing rules for sororities:
Each rushee must obtain a ballot from the Dean of Womens 
office on which she will list her preferences. The ballot must be 
filed in the office by 10:30 a.m. Monday, October 20, 1952. Anyone 
who does not submit her ballot of preference by that time will not 
be accepted until the next rushing season unless otherwise indi
cated to the Dean of Women. It is very important to fill in all 
preferences.
The lists of the sororities and those of the rushees will then 
be matched by the Dean of Women, and the results will be given 
to the sororities at 3:00 p.m., Monday, October 20, 1952. There shall 
be no discussion of the list with anyone not affiliated with the 
sorority.
Rushees may pick up their invitation at 4:30 p.m., Monday, 
October 20, and must answer wTith written acceptance or regret by 
5:00 p.m. in the Dean of Womens office.
IF NO BID
Any girl who fails to file a ballot on time or pick up her bid on 
time will be considered ineligible to join a sorority until the next 
formal rushing period. She shall be eligible for informal rushing. 
Any girl who fails to make a reply on time will be considered in
eligible to join a sorority for one rushing season.
If a girl does not receive a bid from any of the sororities listed 
on her preferential ballot, she is eligible at any future time to be 
rushed informally, provided she meets all eligibility requirements 
at that time.
After a rushee has given her word in writing to pledge to a 
particular sorority, it shall be considered a violation of the standards 
of ethical conduct for a member of any other sorority to suggest or 
even talk to her concerning repudiation of such an agreement. Any 
violation shall be reported to Panhellenic Council.
A rushee shall not, under any circumstances, expect or accept 
a bid to a sorority before 4:30 p.m. October 20, 1952, nor shall a 
sorority make any commitments to a rushee.
Luncheon and dinner dates are permissible during informal 
rushing and during the formal rushing period, which is from Septem
ber 21 until the beginning of silence period at 10:30 p.m. Sunday, 
October 19.
SILENCE RULES EXPLAINED
Silence period begins Sunday, October 19, at 10:30 p.m., and 
ends Monday, October 20, at 6:00 p.m. This period of silence will 
be maintained by all actives, pledges not yet initiated, and rushees. 
Silence is interpreted as meaning no communication direct or in
direct by note, word, telephone, with the exception of hello in 
passing.
There is to be no communication in the dormitory at any time 
between actives, pledges not yet initiated, and rushees. There will 
be no sorority social gatherings for rushees, other than those parties 
scheduled during formal rushing, September 21 to October 20 in
clusive. Rushing is to be based on the honor system for both sorority 
and rushee.
If a rushee is a roommate of a sorority girl, each must use her 
own discretion in maintaining the honor system. If this sorority 
girl has visitors of her sorority or of another sorority, no conversa
tions are permitted in the presence of the rushee during silence 
period. Discretion in maintaining the honor system is also to be 
applied in the case of commuters.
There will be no social telephone calls between members of 
sororities and rushees from September 21 to Octobr 20 inclusive, 
other than calls for the purpose of making luncheon dates.

ROTC Offers 
Men Activities
The Carnegie Tech ROTC or
ganization, under the leadership 
of Col. Morris, has initiated a 
full program of activities for the 
enjoyment and participation of 
the ROTC students.
Three rifle teams will be formed 
to compete against each other, 
the outstanding members of which 
will be offered a spot on the CIT 
varsity rifle squad, which will 
take part in inter-collegiate 
competition with other ROTC 
units.
The ROTC band is now being 
organized, as are various pistol 
and firing clubs.
Enrollment statistics, as releas
ed by the military department, 
show that 260 freshmen, or about 
80 per cent of those eligible, have 
taken military science, the highest 
number of freshmen ever to be 
enrolled in the Tech ROTC. Out 
of a total cadet enrollment of 
635, 55 are seniors, and 97 are of 
the junior class. From these ad
vanced course members, cadet offi
cers will be chosen to lead the 
regiments in the field.
Although the burden of instruc
tion has increased greatly, there 
is substantially no change in the 
personnel of the military depart
ment. Some new faces, however,

Frosh Policy Aided By Upperclasses
Dinkless Frosh Sweep 
Leaf-Strewn Sidewalk

Drinking Fountains At Tech 
Drink With CareOr Else!
by Bob McQuaid
Many of the mechanical wonders of the Atomic Age present 
varied dangers, especially to budding engineers. For the benefit of 
these freshmen who worry not, being content in their omniscience, 
we propose to compose a series of articles to outline these dangers.
One of these traps which the* 
freshmen meet every few steps in
the various buildings are the many 
electric water fountains. The dan
gers here are disguised but they 
can have dire consequences.
Main Trouble
The main trouble encountered 
here is due to the lack of knowl
edge of the correct way to get the 
water from the fountain into the 
mouth. Any freshman engineer 
who has diligently studied his al
gebra realizes that the water arcs 
out of the fountain in a curve 
formulated by y-4=4(x-l)2. Of 
course, other corrections should be 
added to account for changes in 
pressure and temperature. How
ever, these corrections can be 
more considered negligible for our 
purposes. At any rate, there are 
three different places to attack 
this stream of water, at x 
x=l and x3/2. These corre
spond respectively.to the water go
ing up, the water at the peak of 
the arc, and the water coming 
down.
At each point, there are differ
ent problems. The water comes 
to the first point with such force 
that much sprays out of the 
mouth and splatters the necktie. 
However, one advantage is that no 
work is needed to get the water 
into the mouth and, for this rea
son, this is the lazy mans spot.
May Wash Face
On the other hand, at the third 
point the water stream spreads 
and often sprays the drinkers 
face. So, this is often used for a 
dual purpose, to satisfy thirst and 
to wash the face simultaneously.
The happy medium seems to be

Last week the upperclassmen of Carnegie Tech moved into high

over the reportedly large number of freshmen without their dinks

Take Special Care
Special care must be exercised 
in filling a glass with water at a 
Skibo fountain. Quite often the 
person reaches diagonally across 
the fountain with his right hand 
while he pushes the button on the 
vertical faucet with his left. Often, 
however, he inadvertently treads 
on the foot pedal and in so doing 
soaks his right forearm and sleeve.
Countless profane words have re
sulted from this in the few years

Shakespeare Answers
Editor, the Tartan:
May we rag you with a bit of Shakespeare?
Since nothing so stockish, herd, and 
full of rage,
But MUSIC for the time doth change 
his nature
The man that hath no MUSIC in 
himself,
Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet 
sounds.
Is fit for treasons, stratageins, and 
spoil,
The motions of his spirit are dull as 
night and his affections dark as 
Erebiis,
Let no such man be trusted.
Merchant of Venice

(Editor's noteThe above letter pertains to 
the letter published last week by an Irate Cap- ' 
tain of Industry concerning the disturbance caus
ed in the new IA building by the practicing music 
students.)
All Hail Alma Mater!
Editor, the Tartan:
It was with great reluctance that I stood during 
the half-time ceremonies of the California game 
and listened to the miserable chanting of our Alma 
Mater. Outside of the freshmen, no student has an 
excuse for not knowing the words. J thought I 
might be able to do my school a small favor by 
having you print the words^
The Alma Mater
Here where spangled wildernesses 
Robed the mountains of the west,
Where the savage strife and stresses 
Brought the settlers crimson quest;
Land of legend, glory, graces,
Gypsy tide and rolling shore,
Mid thy hilltops Alma Mater,
Stands enthroned forevermore,
Hail Carnegie; Alma Mater
Stand enthroned forevermore.
One more little thing that w^ould bring great 
joy to this humble reader of your sheet during 
the football games would be the announcing of the 
band formations. I realize that this is impossible 
while the band is playing, but during those lapses 
where they toot for cadence only, the announcer 
could briefly say what was going to be done (or 
had been done).
Sincerely,
A Loyal Senior

Interest Sets The Pace
On the way home from the opening football game last 
weekend we mingled with other CIT students and listened j 
to the various opinions on Carnegies gridiron might (or! 
lack of it according to some). But everyone possessed a 
little of that mysterious quality we hear so much about 
and of which, were told, we have so littleschool spirit. 
Some said we shouldnt have passed then, others wished 
the coaches had let someone play who didnt; but all-in-all, 
each was proud of CITs team and satisfied with the sched
ule, lack of scholarships, etc.
We found the complainers after a little investigation. 
They had not been to the football game, but had been lis
tening to the big games, studying, or watching the Panthers 
troucne the Hawkeyes. These are the sports fiends of the 
Tech campus who live in a world whose glories theyll 
never realize. Every evening they read the newspapers and 
then rave about Princeton, Maryland, or other schools, which 
in their eyes represent the maximum in athletic prowess. 
However, they soon turn their thoughts and words to Tech 
and voice wishes for athletic scholarships, a big stadium, 
and a big time schedule.
If these students are so interested in changing the athletic 
setup at Carnegie, there is only one way to make themselves 
heard. Seems the administration found out long ago not to listen 
to all the renovations proposed by sections of the student body. 
What they want to see is action. If only half of the students 
attend football games, rallies, etc., why should the school spend 
a large proportion of everyones tuition on athletics? Those who 
want the football (or for that matter, any student activity) im
proved must get out and make themselves heard at pep rallies 
and games. Then, too, they had better sound more enthusiastic 
in talking to people around town about the football prospects. 
Our athletic budget could stand a nice hike if many of Pitts
burghs football lovers could be diverted to Forbes Field.
However, if this dissatisfied bunch should begin to sit 
in the football swing at Tech, they would soon find out that 
we have a wonderful arrangement with no need for ex
pansion. Too many are more interested in talking big foot
ball at home and among each other than having a program 
fitted to the schools needs. In fact, considering the academic 
load thrown at us, its lucky the school devotes as much 
time and money to the pigskin sport as it does.
Many of the technologists around here like to com
pare Carnegie to MIT and Cal Tech. The scholastic burden 
at each is hard to rate, but all must be equal. Their gov
erning fathers dont even let athletics interfere with classwork. It also might be interesting to see what caliber of 
students we could draw here with athletic scholarships in 
the big-time level. Any athletes we lured to the Tartan 
team who werent, selected for scholastic ability would be 
out before they earned their numerals.
Crawling over on the other side of the fence for a 
minute, we find that the boys who tote the ball up and down 
he field are very well satisfied with the status quo. Menon more practice, more competition for starting, and they 
eally groan. These guys represent the football world at 
Tech and theyre playing because they love the game; nc:: 
to be, with, or play against professionals.
Inquiring Reporter
What Scot Needs
by Ken Winston
The following question was asked around campus 
during the past week: What type of articles would 
you like to see in the new Scot?
Dick Dickerson, physical chemistry senior 
The new Scot, if it isnt to go 
the way of previous issues, must ir'r>' 
be designed to sell. It shouldnt 
be propped up financially by 
the school, and degenerate into 
a glorified carnival program.
In order to sell, it has to appeal to the students. For this
reason, I think it should concentrate on humor instead of Jil M i
varieties, for the most part. ^ J
Good humor has an almost uni- m
versal appeal, while varieties
sports, news, fashions, and feature articlesunless 
extremely well written, are often only dull.
Several good writers have shown up in the 
Tartan. Durstines John J. John series on Tech 
life is an example of some of the best original 
humor to show up at Tech in some time. That 
type of writing, satires on Tech and Pittsburgh, 
good cartoonssyndicated or stolen if necessaryplus varieties-type articles for special events such 
as Carnival, could build a Scot which would be 
interesting, and might last.
Gus Alexy, music junior.The Scot has never 
been interesting to the students 
llv.;as a whole, but rather to a 
small minority running the 
magazine. In the new Scot* 
I would like to see some real 
short stories, something that 
has real plot and interest, some 
Hi good material for laughs and 
some all around campus infor
mationmaybe publicity of or
ganizations by a short history 
and some action photos of the 
group.
In answer to your question about continuing 
the Scot as a humor publicationI have never 
been impressed by what some call humor. Ive 
bought every issue but one and still cant figure 
out where the humor is. My opinion is that what 
Tech needs is a magazine to interest everyone, 
something that will sell itself by its contents. Tech 
students arent interested to too many extra things, 
so this will have to be tops to sell. Alsocollege 
students are always looking for material for bull 
sessionsWhy not give it to them?
Bim Seibert, civil eng. seniorNeither peri
odic reports of campus events 
and conditions, nor printed mat
ter of a purely technical nature, 
nor variety type literature, 
functioning singly, can grant 
the appeal of our student body.
However, a properly balanced 
combination of these three is 
excellently equipped to satisfy 
the individual students desire 
to be posted, enlightened, and 
entertained. It is my candid 
opinion that all three types of
literary endeavor are essential if sufficient oppor
tunity is to be given many of us, who are so 
interested, to participate, according to our choice, 
in the various phases integrated into the final pro
duction of a college publication.
In keeping with the above contentions, it is 
my sincere hope and aim to see our Tartan, Tech
nical, Thistle, Plaid, and others augmented by a
Scot whose contribution to its readers will be a%variety constellation of wholesome humor, creative 
writing, fashions and art, sports, current events 
in essence, palatable food for thoughtwith the 
Tech campus as center of its orbit.
Jerry Lisovich, EE freshmanBeing a fresh
man and new to Tech, I have
never seen a Scot, so I dont
know just what it was like.
However, I think that any norw
technical" magazine should ap
peal to the whole campus and 
m&m nt 3ust to a small clique. I
pi like to see lots of illustrations
JJ W - in a magazine. I think perhaps
* ^ some cartoons also help liven
\ 1 UP Scot. As far as features,
4 wt i i think possibly a girl or boy
of the month would center 
more interest on the Scot.
Having not seen very many issues of the Scot 
' cannot say whether or not I think it should renain a humor magazine, however, if the Scot 
continues in its policy of clean, wholesome humor 
hen I feel that it should definitely remain a humor 
aagazineproviding of course that it would, with 
the policy, have enough appeal.

Yard Scoring Dash in Third Period Clinches Victory
The Carnegie Tartans lost an uphill fight in their initial contest*-
of the 52 season to the Vulcans from California S.T.C., 27-21.
Led by their star fullback, bruising Elmo Natali, who bludgeoned 
the Plaid defense for an average of 6.5 yards per carry in 23 at
tempts, the Red and Black took ---------------------------------------------------
a cmomanding lead of 14-0 in 
the second quarter and were
never headed. Their cause was 
also aided by two interceptions 
and the recovery of four CIT fum
bles.
Standouts on offense for the 
Clan were Irv Schecter and Gil 
Dissen on the ground while Ed 
Miller put on arL aerial display. 
Dissens 50 yard run was Techs 
longest gain.
Shortly after the opening of the 
second quarter, the Scots second 
miscue opened the way for the 
first Vulcan score. Taking the 
ball on the Tartan 21, Natali led 
his team to paydirt, carrying over 
from the 1 yard line. Grandys 
conversion made the score 7-0.
Shortly after the return kickoff, a Plaid fumble set up by the 
second of Cals T.D.s. Taking over 
on the Tartans 24, it took only 
three plays before Natali hit the

Fighting to overcome this def
icit, the Plaid took the kickoff 
and twelve plays later, Craig 
caught a short pass over center 
for the initial Tartan score. Dis
sen converted. The major factor in 
the advance was a 30 yard pass 
from Kennedy to Craig which 
carried to the five. The score came 
with only 40 seconds left in the 
half.
Inspired by Coach Eddie Bak
ers halftime remarks, and lead 
by Dissen, the Scots took the 
second half kick-off deep into
Vulcan territory before losing the 
ball on the 9 on downs.
After an exchange of punts, Cal 
held the ball on the 22 where Na

plays, one a 73 yard smash 
through center. The conversion 
failed.
In the waning minutes of the 
third quarter the Tartans fought 
back by marching 57 yards in 13 
plays for the second T.D. with 
Kennedy skirting left end for the 
score. Dissen converted.
In an exchange of punts, in the 
fourth quarter, the Tech safety 
man fumbled on his 23 and Flem

Cherocci turned right end for 12 
and the Vulcans last score.

A blocked Cal punt by A1

on the opponents 19. A Carricato 
pass to Craig moved the pigskin 
to the six from where Craig took

Dissen converted his third 
straight. After the return kickoff, 
Cal managed to retain possession 
for the last three minutes.

Contest Winner
Accurate Point Choice 
Determines Close Race
The first contest award for the 
1952 football season went to 
Frank E. Carter, a senior mechan
ical engineer, of the Kappa Sigma 
fraternity. Including a miscue on 
the Carnegie-California game, 
Carter had 11 right out of 15.
George Berringer, also a senior 
chemical engineer, had 11 correct 
but did not predict the point 
spread nearly as accurately as 
Carter. Of all the entries receiv
ed only two chose California over 
Tech, and one indicated a tie.
A certificate for the 1953 This
tle will be presented to the win
ner of the contest by the Tartan

Time Trials Held for Harriers; 
Jeannette to be 1st Opponent
Carman Earns No. 1 Spot With Flashing Win; 
Robertson, Flynn Are Freshmen Standouts
Coach Guy Halfertys initial cross country time trials were run 
last Friday, September 26, over the Schenley park course. The results
were not encouraging, but Mr. Halferty expects much improvement
before the harriers meet Jeannette in their first intercollegiate com
petition this season. ?---------------------------------------------------------
Returning letterman Bob Car

and will add some much needed 
experience to the roster.
Outstanding Frosh
John Muller and freshman Roger 
Coyle also turned in creditable

times, although the lack of suffi
cient training and conditioning was 
apparent from the results of the 
trials.
Outstanding among the fresh
man leggers are Jim Flynn from 
Wilkinsburg and Dave Robertson 
from Central Catholic in Cleve
land. Although inexperienced and 
unsure, the frosh candidates look 
promising for future seasons and 
Coach Halferty anticipates pointwinning performances from them 
before the seasons end.
Meet Jeannette
Having practiced for only eight 
days prior to the time trials on 
Friday, the results can only be con
sidered as an indication. The first 
real picture of the team will come 
out of the meet with Jeannette on 
October 4.
Jeannettes outstanding runner, 
Chuck Fee, participated in the 
AAU Olympic trials in California 
this past June. Although he failed 
to earn a position on the team, his 
ability is certified by his attend
ance at the trials.

the 1952 Bison gridders are im
proved over last years eleven 
which won three and dropped five. 
Factual evidence seems to contra
dict this statement, however, for 
in last Saturdays encounter Beth
any suffered a humiliating 40-20 
setback at the hands of Davis and 
Elkins.
Bethanys 1952 football team 
will be small in size and number, 
with the accent on speed. Only 
17 lettermen will be returning to 
the field this year.
As in previous years, Coach 
Donald Fuoss will use the T-formation which is built around the 
fine passing arm of Bob Decker 
and the quick opening plays of a 
fast charging line.
Conference Standout 
Co-captain Decker, a junior 
from Bellaire, Ohio, set several 
West Virginia Intercollegiate Con
ference ^records last year as he 
averaged 139 yards per game in 
eight contents with his sharp pass
ing. Ten of his passes were good 
for touchdowns. With an accumu
lation of 1,112 yards by passing, 
Bullet Bob led the conference in
total offensive yardage with room 
to spare.
Should Decker prove as devas
tating through the air as Elmo (the 
rascal) Natali did last week on 
the ground, the Tartan pass de
fenders will be kept on their toes 
all afternoon.
To confront this situation, Coach 
Eddie Baker will use a 5-3-2-1 de
fensive setup with stop-thatDecker-pass positions in the 
backfield assigned to Byron Eisaman, Dale Peoples, and Eddie 
Miller.
Blatt To See More Action
Fullback Jim Blatt, who didnt 
see much action offensively last 
week because of a pulled muscle, 
will be ready to go against the 
Bisons.
Having won nine of ten games, 
Carnegie Tech holds a lop-sided 
edge over Bethany in the TartanBison series which began back in 
1912. A resume of the series:

Repetition Of 
Monte Carlo
Last years Monte Carlo was 
such a huge success and demands 
for another evening of the same 
are so great that this years even
ing school social chairman, Ken 
Pore, already has his plans under 
way for an even bigger event. 
The carnival is slated for Satur
day evening, October 18, at This
tle hall.
As last year, Monte Carlo car
nival brings to the Carnegie Tech 
campus authentic roulette wheels, 
dice games, and casino. Latch on
to your wife, husband, boy friend 
or girl friend, and other friends. 
Bring them all along for ar even
ing of real fun. Everyone at one 
time or another has had the urge 
to gamble away some of his or her 
money, so come on over and try 
your luck with Lady Luck. Plenty 
of stage money will be given to 
all attending. Ask anyone who 
came last year if they had a good 
time, then come and have one 
yourself.
Parking Space 
For Faculty Only
A reserved parking area for 
evening school faculty members 
has been established. The restrict
ed section is bounded by a chain 
in front of Fine Arts college and 
the gate at Margaret Morrison 
college. The area will be open to 
pass holders, who must pay one 
dollar fee for the privilege.
This measure was found necessary 
in order that evening students 
would be assured having instruc
tors available on time to expound 
on knowledge for which they are 
so eagerly waiting.
This project is on an experi
mental basis at present, until the 
space requirements of the even
ing school faculty are definately 
determined.
Night Students 
Newman Club 
Meets Oct. 5
On Sunday afternoon, October 
5, at 2 p.m. the Evening School 
Newman club will hold its first 
meeting of the current school 
year. The place of the meeting is 
the Knights of Columbus hall, 201 
N. Craig St. All Catholic evening 
school students are invited to at
tend. The purpose of the club is 
to deepen the spiritual and enrich 
the temporal lives of its members 
through a balanced program of re
ligious, intellectual, and social ac
tivities. Present at this meeting 
will be the chaplain of Carnegie 
Tech Newman clubs, Father J. 
Regis Berkmyre, and Pittsburghs 
Federation chaplain Father 
Grundler.
If it is impossible for you to at
tend this meeting and you do have 
a desire to be a member do not 
hesitate to write to Victor F. Sa
bol, 417 George st., Braddock, Pa., 
or phone EL 1-2284.
The Newman club is one of the 
most active of the regular day 
school organizations. Lets make 
our night school group even bet
ter.

Letter
Editor, the Plaid:
On Friday evening, September 
26, I parked my car next to the 
blinker in front of A H to attend 
classes from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 
Upon arriving at my car at 8:30 
p.m. I found that someone had 
double parked and I could not get 
my car out. It just so happened 
I that I had no immediate engagei ment for the evening beyond 
: wanting to get home. Suppose I 
| had received an emergency call 
to come home? I would not have 
i been able to go. If all drivers 
| would only put themselves in the 
j other fellows place, they would 
i think twice before doing such an 
: inconsiderate thing.
Signed,
A Disgruntled Driver 
Editors Note: We realize that 
the parking facilities at Tech 
have been taxed, partially be! cause of the overflow from aci tivities at Forbes Field, however 
! this is still no reason for double 
1 parking. City law makes double 
parking liable to fine, so watch 
your step, the next student may 
do more than write the Editor. He 
may let the city police do the 
writing on a nice little parking 
| tag.
t Remember, there is the large 
parking lot, entered to fromForbes Street, when additional 
parking space is needed to com
pensate for conflicts with civic 
events in Oakland.
STUDENTS!
Sigma Delta Phi
Busy This Summer / 
Through the efforts of social 
chairman Tony Miscimarra, the 
members of Sigma Delta Phi fra
ternity were active all summer.
An enjoyable evening at the 
Civic Light Opera was one of the 
successful events of the season. 
A'ter the operetta the group met 
at Jordans for a lunch and group 
singing.
The corn and weiner roast held 
a few weeks ago was well attend
ed. Many of the group stayed late 
and enjoyed singing by the fire
side. Ray Schwalm, recently dis
charged from the army, entertain
ed the party with a discussion of 
conditions in Germany where he 
had been stationed. Ray was very 
active in extracurricular work | 
during his previous enrollment at j 
Tech having been elected presi
dent of Council the year he was 
drafted.
News
And
Views
We were surprised to note the 
interest shown in a student chap
ter of the ASME. Last year Frank 
Mihelich received such a small 
response that he gave up the pro
gram; however this year Frank 
was able to get 25 students to 
subscribe within a very short 
time.
The Pittsburgh Playhouse will 
open its Fall season at its new 
craft theater on October 4. Veter
an actress Alma Lind will be costarred with Russell Whitney in 
Eugene ONeills clasic Ah Wil
derness in the opener. The play 
is scheduled to run for four weeks.
Evening school registrar, Dal 
McKelway, was surprised at the 
results shown by the IBM cards. 
Although fewer students register
ed, no classes had to be dropped 
because of insufficient enrollment 
in any one class. In fact, some of 
the classes were larger than has 
been the experience in the past. 
This seems to indicate that each 
student is carrying a heavier 
schedule.

It is with great reluctance that I take up my typewriter to dis
cuss the topic at hand this week. I hate unpleasant subjects. That 
topic is freshmen (a form of life found principally on the Ameri
can college campus). I am loath to say anything adverse about the

Tech Wives
There will be a meeting to
night of the Tech Wives elub 
at 8:00 p.m. in the Carnegie 
Union. The purpose of this 
meeting is to organize for the 
coming year. Any wife of a 
Tech student, either day or 
night, is invited to attend.

ened toward the disturbance, 
thinking that perhaps a neutrino 
or some other dangerous particle 
had escaped the watchful gaze of 
the physics department to wreak 
havoc on the populace.
But on coming closer to that 
temple of the natural, and some
times unnatural, sciences, Engi
neering Hall, I saw a sight far 
different from a neutrino. At first 
glance it looked like a vast mob 
of ragged peasant women, armed 
with pitchforks and wooden 
spears, approaching my dearly 
beloved EH (where I was to have 
a lab in myopic analysis the next 
hour) with evil intent in their 
eyes. Swarming the Bastille, no 
less.
Only Freshmen
My blood boiled within me at 
the sight. I unsheathed my trusty 
sliderule, set the index at e, and 
prepared to defend to the death 
my fundamental rights to mass, 
energy, and velocity.
But soon, as the mob appeared 
from the fog, the approaching 
hoard turiled out to be but several

score of enraged women (fresh
man women I was to learn later 
from a friend who is acquainted 
with these matters) being herded 
by some hundreds of other wom

Not Unlike People
I had never before looked up 
my handbooks long enough to re
alize that there are women in the 
world other than my dear old 
mother and my sister Johanna. 
Some of them are in fact quite 
nice looking, not at all unlike peo
ple in many respects. I would 
like to call my fellow engineers 
attention to this. But that is hard
ly to the point.
When I learned that his un
ruly mob meant no harm, but was 
merely a group of students intent 
on cleaning off one of the cement 
walks which run across the bar

wilderness by the poets) on which 
this institution is situated, I felt

at ease again, temporarily at
least.
Deep Ditches
To be brief, these personsthe 
freshmenhad been so unwise as 
to neglect to wear their headgear 
that day. In punishment for this 
grevious sin, they were forced to 
clean the aforementioned walk. 
This was a great inconvenience to  
a number of students and faculty 
of the engineering school, causing 
them to walk on other walks or 
on the grass, which is currently 
filled with deep ditches, presuma
bly dug by the ROTC for use in 
one of their maneuvers.
Might Trip
Therefore I would like to ad
monish you freshmen, both fe
male and otherwise, of the inad
visability of doffing your dinks until the prescribed day. Such action 
proves most inconvenient, as I 
have pointed out, to those of us 
who are deep in our labors with 
hyperbolic arc cosecants and Bes
sel functions. We might trip over 
a broom and become seriously in
jured, not being aware of the 
dangers that lie ahead.
