Weathermans Sabotage 
Didnt Dampen Spirits!
Carnegie students wearily returned to classes yesterday after 
an exciting, though damp, Spring Carnival weekend.
Festivities began in full force on Friday morning with the buggy 
races. In the afternoon, as rain pattered on the Gymnasium roof, 
Queen Jane Connor and her court*
of five women officially opened the 
Carnival wc ekend to the stirring 
music of the Kiltie Band and the 
songs of the Mens and Womens 
Glee Club. Five honoraries gave 
their calls and the Tartan and 
AAUW presented awards to four 
students.
Sun At Last!
The sun broke through the 
clouds long enough for the Mardi 
Gras floats to wind their way up 
Margaret Morrison Street. Pass
ing in review before the crowd 
lining the sidewalks were The 
Spirit of Bacchus, Champagne 
Float, King Neptunes Court, 
Zulus Procession and many 
others.
Rege Cbrdic, popular WWSW
 disc jockey, emceed the Friday 
night show starring Dave Crantz; 
Gloria Wayne and Rosemary 
OReilly, well-known vocalists of 
local TV shows; and the Eric 
Stamford trio. Before and after 
the floor show, Walt Harper and 
his band provided music for danc
ing and listening.
The finals of the buggy compe
tition provided some tense mo
ments as students watched the 
racers flash around the course with 
the Delts coming in first. Varsity 
Varieties furnished an afternoon 
of fun and laughter as the seven 
sororities and Citcom sang and 
danced in Thistle Hall.
Sea of Mud
A sea of mud prevented a 
booming business on the Midway, 
but hay and sawdust helped the 
Carnival to get back in step. On 
Saturday afternoon the sun shone 
once again as the Camivalgoers 
shuffled from booth to booth amid 
the cries of the barkers, the tink
ling music of the merry-go-round, 
and smells of hot-dogs and pop
corn.
Shep Fields and his Rippling
 Rhythm provided the finale of 
the weekend on Saturday night at 
the traditional formal. In a swirl 
of filmy gowni and immaculate 
tuxedos, the wet but wonderful 
Spring Carnival ended for another year.

Tickets for the present 
Carnegie production of We 
Arrive as Strangers by dra
ma senior Gene Feist are still 
available in the drama office,

Delts Win Pushmobile Race; 
DU Float Takes Top Honors
Kappa Sigs Best In Buggy Design Competition
While AE Phi Cops Varsity Varieties Trophy
By Joe Weidman
Long hours of work on their racer finally paid off for the Delta 
Tau Deltas on Saturday morning as they captured the sweepstakes 
trophy for the fourth consecutive year. Posting a winning time of 
2:41.6, the Delts pushmobile finished the gruelling course 12.4 sec
onds ahead of the Kappa Sig en-* '
try which copped second prize.
Delta Upsilon fraternity placed 
third in the race.
Both the Pi Kappa Alpha and 
Citcom Clan buggies were dis
qualified in the preliminary heats 
held Friday morning. Although 
they had the fourth best time in 
the prelims, and were thus enti
tled to enter  the final round of 
races, the PiKAs efforts were 
discounted when it was learned 
they had changed pushers outside 
of the neutral zone provided for 
that purpose. A broken handle on 
the Citcom buggy, suffered at the 
start of the race, automatically 
eliminated them from competition 
under the established rules.
Consolation
Consolation was given the Kap
pa Sigmas, however, when that 
fraternity was awarded the first 
prize in the racer design compe
tition. Judged on both engineer
ing and esthetic principles by 
three members of the faculty, Cal
vin M. Willey, William H. Bessey, 
and Louis M. Laushey, the KSs 
sleek aluminum pushmobile fea
turing a teardrop design won 
out over the 13 other entries.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon took sec
ond place, demonstrating again

tion of the sweepstakes design 
competition.
Consideration was given by the 
judges to the ingenuity, workman
ship, safety, soundness of con
struction, and functional beauty 
evidenced in the buggies. The 
new requirement of brakes for all 
racers proved to be a worthwhile 
improvement.
Floats Successful 
Although slightly the worse for 
the rain which had fallen earlier 
in the day, the float parade held 
Friday afternoon was ah unquali
fied success. Featuring as its 
theme Spirit of Bacchus and de

of Bacchus surrounded by attendents, the Delta Upsilon entry took

Sigs with their interpretation of 
the difference between the mean
ing and the actual celebration of 
Mardi Gras. Delta Tau Delta 
placed third with their Campagne Float from which colored 
balloons, representing champagne 
bubbles, escaped.
An impartial group of judges 
composed of Cy Hungerford of 
the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Miss 
Rita Tedesco of Gimbles Display 
Department, Piene Zoelly of the 
Department of Architecture, and 
Richard Felver of the Painting 
and Design Department, individu
ally judged the floats on the orig
inality, craftsmanship, appearance, 
and appropriateness shown.

year in Thistle Hall, provided a 
standing room only audience 
with an hour and a half show of 
humorous skits ranging in theme

Developing Individual 
Important in College
By John Cox
Mr. Cox served three years with the Army Air Force, as a B24 
pilot in the Pacific. He received a BS in Commerce from Ohio Univer
sity, Athens, Ohio, and had one year of business experience before 
enrolling in the department of printing management at Carnegie. 
College training is worthwhile,?-------------r---------------------------
but I believe there is a definite 
need for improvement in at least 
one part of that training. That is, 
in the development of the individ
uality of the student.
It probably sounds like a lot of 
propaganda to say that the stu
dents of today will be the leaders 
of tomorrow, but it is true and it 
has been proven that a leader has 
to do his own thinking if he wishes 
to lead well.
Human Element 
I saw some figures once that 
stated that over 60% of the col
lege graduates who were fired 
from jobs were fired because of 
reasons other than a lack of 
knowledge of their work. This 
means that there is a noticeable 
lack of character, personality, and 
ability to get along with people, 
and the ability to get along with
out some people.
For some people, the business 
world is plenty toughbecause 
they are not properly prepared for 
it. They have gone through life 
being a good Joe, helpful and 
cooperative, but cast always in a 
minor role. Consequently when 
they go out into the business 
world they are not able to assume 
its responsibilities. They find that 
in the business world no one is 
interested or has time (usually) to 
help them become adjusted.
Safe Sanctuary 
College is a comparatively safe 
sanctuary in which to develop in
dividuality. There are always 
many decisions that have tc be 
made; and the better you handle 
these, the better chance you will 
have to succeed in later life. Dont 
carry your troubles to the cam
pus big shotdecide for yourself, 
and then act. If you are wrong, 
youll know better next time.
Individualism is an elusive 
thing, but very important. I seri
ously doubt if anyone of college 
intelligence can be successful or 
happy wuthout it. Our fine arts 
students are frantically searching 
for their individuality and we 
should admire their effort for 
what it is. Their means does not

have to be the one employed by 
everyone, quiet dignity is another 
powerful means of expressing in
dividuality.
Re-evaluation 
Anyone interested in individ
ualism must first formulate his 
own plans and ideas on important, 
basic things, Re-evaluate your 
friends and acquaintances by these 
new standards and learn to get 
along without those whose ideas 
are not compatible to your own. 
Seek those who have an open 
mind, and who encourage new 
ideas.

Tennis Team Defeats 
Geneva in Fourth Win
The varsity tennis team continued its torrid pace, Wednesday, 
May 9, as the Tartans handed the netmen from Geneva a decisive 
8-1 setback. The Plaid racqueteers swept all but one singles match 
in chalking up their third consecutive win.
Bob Weiderhorn, John Mont-*
stream, Don Duncklee, Mahlon 
Saibel, and Bob Duffuss all mark
ed up singles victory as they roll
ed over the Genevamen. Kroen 
turned in the only Covenanter 
victory as he bested Larry Cederstrom 6-1, 1-6, 6-3. The Plaid 
took the doubles matches as they 
won all three in straight sets.
The Tartans encountered a lit
tle more difficulty against Gettys
burg the preceding Monday, but 
emerged as 6-3 victors in a match 
halted twice because of bad 
weather. The match, played on
the Mt. Lebanon courts, extended 
the Tartan victory string to four 
wins against one early season de
feat.
The Plaid again won all but 
one singles match, the only loss 
being George Berringers 7-5, 6-4 
defeat at the hands of Clark of 
Gettysburg. High point of the 
afternoon was Bob Weiderhor'ns 
thrilling comeback as he won his 
singles match from McClure of 
Gettysburg, Weiderhorn returned 
to form and ran off the next two 
sets by love scores, 6-0, 6-0.
Tartan Golfers 
Handed First 
Loss By Pitt
The Tartan golfers met their first 
defeat of the season at the hands 
of their old rival, Pitt, as they 
dropped a 7%-l%match, Wednes
day. The record now stands at 
three wins, one loss, and one tie 
for the Carnegie linksmen.
Ed Denburg was the only Plaid 
winner of the day in the off-form 
loss. Defeating McCarthy of Pitt, 
three and two in his match and 
tieing for best ball of his four
some, Denburg accounted for all 
of the Tartans 1% points.
In a match with Gettysburg, 
Monday, the Plaid golfers marked 
up their third victory of the year 
as they won rather handily, 13-5.

Johnny Luchok W ins 
Tartan Varsity Award
Witt And Motter Named To Share 
Intramural Athletics Presentation
Johnny Luchok, Frank Witt, and Frank Motter stepped into the 
sports spotlight in the middle of Spring Carnival festivities Friday, 
as they walked off with the annual Tartan awards for the outstand
ing varsity and intramural athletes.
For the first time in the history#------------------------------*-------------------
of the awards two men, Frank 
Motter and Frank Witt, were 
named co-recipients of the intra
mural honor. The outstanding 
abilities of Witt and Motter were 
felt to be so evenly matched that 
the members of the Tartan com
mittee broke precedent to recog
nize this fact.
Good Choice 
Luchok, whose selection met 
with popular approval from the 
large crowd of students attending 
Call Day exercises, was the unani
mous choice of the Tartan com
mittee for the Varsity award. The 
Richeyville, Pa., speedster, a mem
ber of Kappa Sigma fraternity, 
was chosen on the basis of his 
strong showing in two sports, both 
football and track.
Not only was Luchok a main
stay last fall of Dr. Eddie Bakers 
gridders as they posted one of 
their best records in twelve years, 
but he has also starred this spring 
for Guy Halfertys cinderteam, 
which is as yet undefeated. Only
a week ago Luchok set a new 
school record for the 100 yard 
dash as he sprinted the distance 
in a fast 9.8.
Motter and Witt, Kappa Sig and 
Emanon number one intramural 
athletes respectively, were named 
as top men on the campus by vir
tue of their outstanding ability in 
the sports in which they partici
pated and their value to their 
teams.
Mainstay
Motter was a mainstay of the 
Kappa Sigma team all year as he 
participated in six sports. Out
standing in volleyball, he led the 
Kappa Sigs to the school cham
pionship in that sport this year.
Witt, although playing in only 
four sports to Motters six, ha* 
been mainly responsible for Emanons powerful showing in tramurals this year. Not only a valu
able player, he has been indispen
sable to Emanon as their chief 
organizer and sponsor.
Don't test one brand alone ...compare them all!
Cindermen Win Fifth Straight; 
Down Washington & Jefferson
Pole Vault And Relay Marks Are Shattered 
As Halfertys Team Continues Winning Ways
The Carnegie Trackmen knocked over two Skibo Bowl records 
Wednesday, May 9, and at the same time captured the dual meet 
with Washington and Jefferson. The 85-46 conquest of the Prexies 
marks the fifth win without defeat for the Plaid this year.
Chuck Bateman soared 12 feet,4------------------------------------------------------
3% inches above the ground to 
win the pole vaulting event for the 
Plaid, and set a new Carnegie rec
ord. His effort replaces the old 
record of 12 feet 2 inches which 
has stood untouched since 1930. 
Following Bateman over the cross
bar was Decker of Wash-Jeff and 
Gerry Blumfeldt of Carnegie to 
take second and third respec
tively.
In the discus competition Taylor 
of Tech sailed the flying saucer 
108 feet, 4 inches to take the top 
honors. Baker took second place to 
score for the visitors as Brourman 
took third for the Plaid.
Connie Hammann put 5 feet, 6 
inches of air between him and the 
ground before gravity pulled him 
down as he received the laurels 
for first place in the high jump.

third. Taylor scored the Plaids 
only points as he took second 
place.

Carnegie men, McKibben and 
Bateman, followed close behind 
and swallowed the two remaining 
pay-off positions.
In the broad jump the Tartans 
led again in the scoring as Milligan 
and Woods ran away with first 
and second places.
The Tech sprinters came across 
for Coach Halferty with three 
firsts, two seconds, and one third 
in the three dashes. Luchok. Wil

ners as they pinned down the top 
honors in the 100, 220, and 440

shoes in the eyes of Mariner, who 
came in second to place for the 
Prexies.

easily eclipsing the Prexy relay 
team, and cutting 2 tenths of a 
second off the old relay record set 
in 1947.
