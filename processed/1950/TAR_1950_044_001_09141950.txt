EditorialAn Open Letter To Freshmen
Its Up To You
You, as an entering freshman, are stepping into four 
years of college life which not- only will be quite different 
from any other period previously, but which also will prob
ably prove to be the most important years of your life. 
Just how important and profitable they are to be depends 
entirely on you. .
Your ultimate place in the world will probably be de
termined more by what you do in the coming four years 
than in any other, comparable periqd in your life.
t the risk of sermonizing, we would like to pass on 
to you one sugestin around which this editorial is built. 
And that is to give Carnegie Tech the chance to do some 
of the things that it can for you.
Most of you are here in search of training in specialized 
fields. Carnegie Tech will see to it that you have every op
portunity to attain whatever your desires may be in the 
line of education. Although success in whatever field you 
are majoring in is of thie utmost importance at all times, 
there is nothing so pitiful than to watch students go through 
college without taking benefit of the'very many extra-cur
ricular activities and social outlets that are provided.
These extra-curricular activities and social events pro
vided for you are valuable in not only giving much-needed 
relief from the day-by-day grind of studies, but in also giv
ing you the opportunity to develop the abilities and graces 
which you will find indispensable later.
Industry has constantly complained that the engineer; ing graduate has depended too much on a proficient tchinical background. He has failed to develop his personality 
jsvhile in college to the point where he could adeptly main
tain the necessary contact and communication with other 
people.
Working in activities teaches cooperation with others 
under vej.-y exacting circumstances. It also affords the op
portunity for leaders of activities to learn something of ad
ministration, and how to direct others effectively without 
offending. . 
The college community has been richly endowed by 
your predecessors on campus; activities have been started 
and steadily improved, social groups and events continue toprosper so that you are able to find almost any kind of ac
tivity to satisfy your goal.
Chose your activities and social contacts carefully, for 
they will bear a great influence upon your future college 
career. Always keep in mind your particular goal in college 
arid life, and never fail to remember that your academic load 
is a most important factor as to how much time you will 
want to spend with activities.
We urge you not to sell yourself short; give Carnegie 
a chance to do the many things for yoii that-it is designed 
to do. Although we all feel certain reluctance about taking 
the first step into; something new, you should realize the 
opportunities you now face and do yourself the favor of 
stepping up to meet them, starting this Very day.
Freshmen Near Completion 
Of Orientation Procedure
Enrollment Drops 
As Vets Tliin Out; 
Frosh In Dorms.
Approximately 3,000 students, 
including an estimated 630 enter
ing freshmen, are expected to en
roll during registration this week. 
-Though this represents a decline of 
about 200 students from last year, 
the figure is still well above the 
pre-war high of 2,400.
In Addition to returning upper
classmen, Fine Arts will receive 
between 175 and 190 freshmen* 
Engineering a riel Science 325 fresh
men, and Margaret Morrison about 
130 freshmen. The number of stu
dents with advanced standing has 
remained, as last year, at about 
225.
Though a housing shortage still 
exists, there should be no serious 
problems.-MiUe freshmen are as
sured of accommodations in the 
dorms, in accord with the new 
freshman policy, while women will 
have no trouble finding ample 
room at'recently remodeled Morewood Gardens. Greatest difficulties 
will be encountered by married 
students, while a slight .shortage 
of rooms may exist for single male 
upperclassmen.
As Carnegie, enters its -sixth, 
postwar year, the ranks of veter
ans are rapidly thinning out. Only, 
about 10% of the total enrollment 
this year will be veterans, as com
pared to 30% last year. The great
est percentage will be, as usual, 
in the senior class.

TAIWANTHURSDAY,. SEPT, 14* 1950
Sophomore Advises 
Bewildered Freshmen
Freshmen, your first week at Carnegie will be a new and dis
turbing experience. Having once been greenhorns, we upperclass
men understand your confusion; we want to give you a few words 
to the wise, hoping they will be sufficient.
No doubt you have received
your dinks. Well; wear them, al
ways. You know, there are tales 
of freshmen disappearing sudden
ly'.from the dormitories on dark, 
rainy nights and, surprisingly 
enough, these missing freshmen 
were members of the why should 
I wear silly dinks club. A word 
to th wise should be sufficient.
Get In Shape
Secondly, plebes, get in fine 
physical trim. Hit ythe sack early 
and do push ups every morning 
before leaving for class. By the 
time Homecoming rolls around 
every freshman must be a per
fect speciman, fit for the battle 
with the upperclassmen. This in
terclass competition pits freshmen 
against sophomores and juniors 
who have been doing push-ups 
regularly for several years. A 
word to the wise should be suffi
cient.
I-Iowever, dont concentrate on 
the physical and neglect your 
mental development. Always . be 
ready to answer quickly yet re
spectfully to your superiors. For 
instance, if a senior walked up 
and asked, "What are you doing 
here, could you r^ply instantly?
Exam Coming
In addition to answering such 
brain-racking questions, you must 
have a complete store of know
ledge on the campus history, songs 
and cheers because your tradi
tions examination will be given 
a few weeks after classes begin. 
Surely you dont wan to bear the 
stigma f; a plebe who failed his 
traditions exam. A word to the 
wise should be sufficient.
One important rule that you 
must not forget is to stay away 
from, walks reserved for.' upper
classmen. If you happen to step 
on such restricted walks you may 
be trampled by upperclassmen 
running to beat the last bell for 
class. Freshmen, do not hold your
 life in such little esteem that you 
would walk on restricted grounds. 
A word to the wise should be 
sufficient.
All Were Plebes
As. freshmen you will find that 
often you unknowingly say or do 
the wrong thing. You are bound 
to make mistakes, but be willing 
to learn. The upperclassmen wel
come you; they want to help you 
find your niche  in college life. 
.Remember, those upperclassmen 
passing by, noses high, were once 
irishmen too.
Name, Rank, . . .
Help APO publish this 
years C Book early. Be sure 
to fill out an information card 
neatly, completely, and ac
curately. Cards will be dis
tributed at the gymnasium en
trances on all registration 
days. Changes of address may 
be made later. BE SURE TO 
FILL OUT A CARD WHEN 
YOU REGISTER.

Architects Try 
New Methods 
In English
Students Will Attack 
English Constructions 
As Design Problems
An architecture students nat
ural abilities in design will be ap
plied to his English course this 
year at Carnegie Tech. The new 
method of teaching, to be  devel
oped by English instructor Earle 
R., Swank in conjunction with the 
architecture faculty, will be in line 
with the schools Carnegie Plan of 
education.
In .describing the new program, 
Mr. Swank said, . . . the con
struction of sentences and para
graphs will be attacked as design 
problems.
The philosophy behind the de 
sign of a good building is funda
mentally similar to that behind the 
construction of a good paragraph. 
We will try to help our students 
see this similarity, and learn how 
to take advantage of it.
In the new,program, students 
will have morning English classes 
three times a week.
In addition, Mr! Swank will sit 
in architecture design drafting 
rooms where he will criticize and 
coach students in speaking about 
their ideas.
Professor John Knox Shear, 
head of Carnegies Architecture 
department, said recently, One of 
the aims of Carnegie Plan is to 
help our students develop what 
it takes to give society professional 
service in their jobs and in civic 
and lopitical life.
How well a man can*serve so.- 
ciety depends, in a large measure, 
on how well he can express him
self. This experiment is an at
tempt to make good writing and 
speaking ah integral part of ar
chitectural education.
The new system of teaching 
English was made possibl^.by a 
$2500 grant from the Wherrett 
Memorial Fund of the Pittsburgh 
Foundation. If successful, it will 
be adopted as a permanent part 
of the Architecture department 
curriculum.

Carnegie Gridders Preparing 
For 1950 Football Campaign
Dj\ Baker Hampered By Lack of Reserves; 
Wiseman Only Experienced Lineman Returning
Faced with the dual problem of lack of experience and a short
age of reserve strength, Carnegie coach Dr. Eddie Baker is sending 
his Tartan grid hopefuls through twice .daily drills. in an effort 
to have them ready for the opening game on September 30.
The veteran football mentor,*-------------------------------------------------------
whose 1949 team startled the foot- ' 
ball world by winning four games,- 
losing three, and tying one, has 
expressed doubt that this years 
team can win more than two 
games. However, Dr. Baker has 
given a note of encouragement in 
his statement that if we can win 
the first two games without too 
many injuries, possibilities for a 
good season will increase.
Meyers, Keats Gone 
Sure to be- missed this year are 
Gerry Meyers and Norm Keats, 
the first team tackles on the 1949
Dr. Edward B. Baker
Tartan Grid Mentor 
squad, arid center Jim Trautman 
and quarterback- Bob Sommer, 
both of whom played outstanding 
roles in last years winning season.
Even more disheartening, how
ever, is the loss of three gridders 
who were slated to play important 
roles in the 1950 football picture. 
Neither guard Larry Stovicek, a 
regular for three years, nor Elmer 
Metzger, who gave promise of be
coming one of the* best halfbacks 
ever to play at Carnegie, will be 
wearing the Plaid this year, both 
being sidelined because of grade 
deficiencies.
Ted Leaman, a transfer student 
from Colgate, was slated for the 
quarterback position from his 
showing in spring drills, but in
stead will be devoting his time to 
the Marines. Leaman also was 
tabbed as the ace defensive back 
last spring.
Simcic Still Threat 
Despite the absence of these

stalwarts, Dr. Baker has at his 
disposal a fairly strong nucleus 
around which to build his 1D50 
grid machine. Incomparable Nick 
Simcic will again be the Plaids 
top offensive threat. Simcic not 
only will do a great deal of the 
ball carrying but is also ready to 
carry most of the passing burden.
In addition to Simcic, the Tar
tans have a host of good backs, 
all of whom are capable of break
ing away for long runs. Johnny 
-Luchok, Gil Dissen, Irv Shechter, 
Arne Oberg, and Jack Magnifico 
aire battling for first team backfield berths, with Luchok and 
Dissen curently holding the edge.
At the all-important quarter
back post, Quent Holtz is the num
ber one man at present, although 
sophomore Jack Brourman is 
showing continued improvement. 
Brourmans chances of playing, 
however, depend to a large extent 
upon how well his injured knee 
responds to treatment.
End Slots Filled
Veteran ends Lou Fougere and 
Fritz Wilson assure Dr. Baker of 
experienced strength at the ter
minal position. Freshman ends 
Gunther and Pacos have shown 
promise, however, and^hould add 
depth at that post.'
The line offers the biggest prob
lem to the coaches, with only 
three-year veteran guard Floyd 
Wiseman returning from last year. 
Wiseman, out with injuries for 
much of the 1949 . season, appears 
to be in good physical condition 
again and is expected to lead the 
attack up front.
Only one other line post appears 
settled, Clyde Stahle having won 
the starting left tackle position. 
At center Larry Krotec and Clyde 
Freeman are battling for the start
ing role, with Krotec showing the 
rrtost promise so far.
Starters Doubtful
At right guard, Ray Shermeyer 
and George Rusnak are the two 
top candidates. Either Hans Lange 
or Joe Galanda will get the call at 
right tackle.
Due . to the lack of reserve 
strength, Dr. Baker has several of 
the gridders learning two offen
sive positons. Injuries to key men 
would hamper the team consider
ably and a successful 1950 season 
depends upon keeping the team in 
good playing condition.

" With the opening of the 1950 football season just around; 
the corner, loyal Tartan rooters ar wondering whether last 
years successes were of a temporary nature or whether 
football is really on the upgrade here at Carnegie. As he 
did last year, cautious Dr. Eddie Baker has made the pre
season prediction of -two. Plaid victories this Fall, with more 
wins possible if the squad avoids injuries.
Naturally, it is hoped that the Skibos can continue their 
winning ways despite the loss of such experienced players as 
Gerry Meyers, Norm Keats, Jim Trautman, Bob Sommer, Larry 
Stovicek, and Elmer Metzger. Reserves ar no more plentiful 
than they were last fall. Despite all the disadvantages, how
ever, the members of the 1950 team are confldent that they can 
equal, if not better, last years record. Certainly this is a healthy 
sign, for a team that has confidence in itself is not easily beaten.
Even with so many of last years key men . gone, the 
Skibos still have a number of good players on hand, par
ticularly in the backfield. Nick Simcic, Johnny Luchok, Gil 
Dissen, Irv Shechter, and Arne Oberg represent a possible 
touchdown every time they carry the ball. Quent Holtz, at 
quarterback, can throw a ball half the length of the field, 
although his accuracy can stand to be improved. Jack 
Brourman can be a tremendous addition to the quarter
back position if his knee can sustain the rough treatment.
Fritz Wilson and Lou Fougere, If they continue to improve 
as they have in the past two years, will'begone of the best pair 
of ends in the district. Only the line remains' a question mark 
in the eyes of the coaches, and this is due chiefly to a, lack of 
experience. Floyd Wiseman, now recovered from a painful Kroin 
injury sustained last year, represents the only experienced line
man on the team. Wiseman offsets his lack of brawn with a 
great deal of speed and a tremendous competitive spirit. Tackle 
Clyde Stahle showed great promise last year, particularly on 
defense, and should continue to improve.'
Hans Lange, George Rusnak, Ray Sfiermeyer, and Joe 
Galanda, all second year men, have shown signs of develop
ing into good linemen but also need game experience. Cen
ters Clyde Freeman and Larry Krotec, neither of whom are 
lettermen, still need a lot of work.
Consequently, we prefer to go along with the players 
and predict at least a season comparable to last years. 
Certainly there is a possibility of defeating seven of the 
eight teams on the schedule, with only Lehigh out of upset 
range. Therefore, four or five victories is not too much to 
expect, and, .knowing that the team is out to at least equal 
last years record, we wish them the best of liick and pledge 
our support all the way.
