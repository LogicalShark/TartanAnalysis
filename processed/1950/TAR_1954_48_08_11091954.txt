Tartans Get By W&JPresidents 21-0
X
By Jim Lacey
Before a jubilant Homecoming crowd at Forbes Field of more than 5000 people, Tech 
not only won its seventh straight but the mythical Class B.title as well, as the Tartans got 
closer to their objectivethe first undefeated season in the schools history.
At something less than its best, the sub-par Plaid team was too good for the scrappy
Prexies, who very definitely out-^-----
fought the heavier and more 
experienced Tech line. From the 
beginning of the game it was a 
succession of breaks for the Tar
tans who could not capitalize on 
them until Phil Jeske stepped 
back and flipped a ten yard pass 
to Roy DeVries who went into the 
endzone for the score. Roy then 
converted for the first of three.
Tech Gets Breaks 
In the first quarter Tech inter
cepted two of Daglish's passes, 
one by Phil Jeske and one by 
Tony Capul, but couldnt budge 
the stubborn Prexie line. More 
breaks were added to the list in 
the second period when John 
Williamson recovered a fumble on 
the W & J four yard line, but 
Tech fumbled on the next play.
Then came two blocked punts, 
one by little Art McGuigan, and

the other by the whole Tech for
ward wall. which Tech capitalized 
on when Jeske tossed to DeVries.
After an exchange of punts 
W & J got going, with Daglish 
calling the plays and Greskovich 
and Goodwin running the ball. 
They drove to the Tech 15 only 
to lose the ball on downs. There 
was another exchange of punts 
and on the first running play Ai 
Schell recovered a Prexie fumble 
on their 44 yard line. On success
ive plays Briner, Quatse and 
Kennedy carried the ball to the 
23. where Tucci whipped a spiral 
into Bill Kennedys hands for the 
TD.
Smith Streaks 52 Yards
After the second Tech score, the 
Prexies again started to march, 
only to see the drive halted when
DeVries intercepted a pass, the 
fourth interception of the game. 
Taking a pitchout from Jeske, 
little Frank Smith ran through 
the W & J team like a will-othe-wisp for 52 yards before be
ing thrown out of bounds. DeVries 
and Blatt punched through the 
line to the one where Jeske went 
over for the final score.
Next week Tech hosts the tough, 
high-scoring Lehigh Engineers 
from Bethlehem who have beaten 
Tech four years in a row and will 
be the last hurdle for the Tartan's 
undefeated season. Since the con
tract with Lehign is expiring this 
year, this may be the last time 
the two teams will play each 
other for quite a while. It may
be well that it should be this way, 
for against much lesser teams than 
Lehigh, the Tartans have given a 
poor account of themselves, as 
was witnessed last week against 
W & J.

IM Football
The muddy encounters of last 
week resulted in a three way tie 
in the Tartan league and decided 
the first and second' place teams 
in the other two leagues.
The SAEs and the ATOs 
fought to a tie in the first game 
that they^ played last week, 24-24, 
as darkness prevented the teams 
from playing the eight play play
off, whereupon the IM Board 
ruled that the entire game be 
: played over. The second game 
ended with the ATOs out in front 
29-12, creating the three way tie 
that now exists. Monday the 
SAEs and KSs will play, the 
loser meeting the ATOs Tuesday. 
The winner of Tuesdays battle will 
; play the winner of Mondays 
game, the outcome of which will 
! decide the league champion.
In other games last week, the 
ATO B team beat the Obelisks 
15-3, the Delts looked pretty good 
whipping the TXs 20-10, while 
the Betas forfeited to the SNs 
and the ASCE forfeited to the 
Static Charges.

Geneva Wins 34-45
As expected, the Gillies-Weaver dual proved to be the 
highlight of the Tri-State meet Friday, and provided the 
1800 people who attended with one of the fastest and most 
exciting races run in Tri-State competition. Mai Gillies
got off to a fast start and set the4----------------------- ---------------------
pace, as he and Homer Weaver, of
Geneva, practically sprinted the 
first half mile. After setting the 
pace for the rest of the pack, 
Gillies lost his lead to Weaver 
midway in the race and never 
could quite regain it. He pushed 
Weaver from that moment until 
the finish, with Weaver almost 
running himself into unconscious
ness. The times were 20:43.3 for 
Weaver and 20:45 for Gillies.
The crowd, not having quite 
settled itself from the above duel, 
was brought to its feet seconds 
later when Jackson of Geneva 
and Techs MacDonald came into 
the stadium, with the Happer 
leading by a few feet. Jackson, 
who is a half-miler, put on his 
sprint and passed MacDonald. 
Hap, who was running an in
spired race, put on a sprint of his 
own, and the two sprinted the 
last quarter of a mile shoulder 
to shoulder, with Hap pulling 
away from Jackson twenty yards 
from the finish to win by six 
inches. ^
Tech took second, fifth and 
seventh, while Geneva took first, 
fourth and sixth, but lack of depth 
gave the meet to Geneva who 
came up with 11 and 12, while 
the Tartans had to be content 
with 14 and 17. Geneva finished 
first and Tech second.
This meet sort of set the stage 
for Techs track meet with Gen

New Elections
Editor, the Tartan:
Without a doubt one of the 
biggest problems in extra-curricu
lar life at Tech today is the lack 
of interest shown in Student 
Council , and Councils resulting 
ineffectiveness. Within a few 
weeks the student body will have 
a chance to partially remedy this 
situation by voting in the forth
coming Council elections for the 
candidates of their choice, candi
dates who have talfen a stand on 
several important issues facing the 
CIT students today. Briefly the 
most important issues about which 
the campaigning will center are 
the following:
1. Councils action of two weeks 
ago which closed fraternity bars 
final social event, the Senior Tea, I during all all-school social funcat Carnegie Union.
Members Invited
All students interested in the 
programs are welcome to attend. 
Anyone interested in joining the 
Home Economics Club may contact

mittee chairman, or any of the 
officers or other committee chair
men.

here, its stars will be Igor Youskevitch, top-ranking classical 
dancer, Nora Kaye, and John

Spring Carnival should include a

3. The degree to which Student 
Council should have jurisdiction 
over the intramural sports pro

4. The proposed Student Union 
assessment which would pay for 
the construction and maintenance 
of the new Student Union build

5. Councils action of last spring 
which eliminated all class officers 
and delegated their duties and 
responsibilities to the activities 
honoraries.
6. The problem of whether to 
enforce freshman regulations or 
do away with them entirely.
7. The general problems of 
varsity sports. Without a doubt 
the student backing of most CIT 
varsity sports is not what it 
should be.
In next weeks Tartan the elec
tion date will be announced; it 
will probably be the first or 
second week in December. In 
about a week petitions wil be 
ready. Every student roup inter
ested in entering a candidate 
should form a comittee and or
ganize a campaign based on their 
position with respect to the above 
issues and any others they think 
important.
Clearly every Tech student is

these problems. Now he will be

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT I
Of all the creatures that inhabit the earth, none is so fair, so warm, 
so toothsome, as a coed.This is a simple fact, well-known to every campus male, and, to most campus males, a source of rejoicing. But not to all. To some, the creamy brows and twinkling limbs of coeds are a bane and a 
burden. To whom? To professors, thats whom.Professors, according to latest scientific advice, are human. Stick them and they bleed, pinch them and they hurt, ring a dinner bell and they salivate, comfront them with a round young coed and 
their ears go back, even as yours and mine.But, by and large, they contain themselves. After all, they are men of high principle and decorum, and besides, the board of regent has got stoolies all over. So, by and large, they contain themselves.But not always. Every now and then a coed will come along who is just too gorgeous to resist, and a professor  his clutch worn out from years of struggle  will slip and fall. White though his hair, multitudinous though his degrees, Phi Beta Kappa though his key, he is as lovesick, moonstruck, and impaled as any freshman.But hes far worse off than any freshman. After all, a freshman can thump his leg, put on his linen duster, and take out after the coed with mad abandon. But what can the poor smitten prof do? How, in his position, can he go courting a young girl undergraduate?In this column and the next one, I am going to deal with this difficult question. I will relate to you, in the form of a two act play, an account of a professors attempt to woo a coed.
The scene is a typical office in a typical liberal arts building on a typical campus. In this shabby setting, we find two men, Professors Twonkey and Phipps. They are lumpy and bent, in the manner of 
English lit professors.
Phipps: Twonkey, a terrible thing hag happened to me. A terrible, 
ghastly thing! Ive fallen in love with a coed.
mega,nti Now, now, thats not so terrible.
Phipps: Oh, but it is. Miss McFetridge for that is her name  is a student, a girl of nineteen. How would her parents feel if they knew I was gawking at her and refusing my food and writing her name on frosty windowpanes with my fingernail?
mega,nti Come now, Phipps, no need to carry on so. Youre not 
the first teacher to cast warm eyes at a coed, you know.
Phipps: You mean its happened to you too?
Twonkey: But of course. Many times.
Phipps: What did you do about it?
Twonkey: Looked at their knees. It never fails, Phipps. No matter how pretty a girl is, her knees are bound to be knobby and bony and the least romantic of objects.
Phipps: Not Miss McFetridgesfor that is her name. They are oft and round and dimpled. Also pink.
Twonkey: Really? Well, Ill tell you something, Phipps. If I ever found a girl with pink knees, Id marry her.
Phipps : It is my fondest wish, but how can I, a professor of fifty, start a courtship with a girl of 19?
Twonkey: Very simple. Ask her to 'come to your office for a confeience late tomorrow afternoon. When she arrives, be urbane, be charming. Ask her to sit down. Give her a cigarette.
Phipps: A Philip Morris.
Twonkey: But of course.
Phipps : I just wanted to be sure you mentioned the name. Theyre paying for this column.
Twonkey : Give her a Philip Morris.
Phipps: Thats right.
Twonkey: Then light her Philip Morris and light one yourself. Say some frightfully witty things about English lit. Be gay. Be insouciant. Keep her laughing for an hour or so. Then look at your watch. Cry out in surprise that you had no idea it was this late. Insist on driving her home.
Phipps: Yes, yes?
Twonkey: On the way home, drive past that movie house that shows French films. Stop your car, as though on a sudden impulse. Tell her that youve heard the movie was delightfully Gallic and naughty. Ask her if shed like to see it.
Phipps: Yes, yes?
Twonkey: After the movie, say to her in a jocular, offhand way 
that after such a fine French movie, the only logical thing would be a fine French dinner. Take her to a funny little place you know, with candles and checked tablecloths. Ply her with burgundy and Philip Morris. Be witty. Be gay. Be Gallic . . . How can a nineteen year old girl resist such blandishments?
Phipps: Twonkey, youre a genius! This will be like shooting fish 
in a barrel... But I wonder if it isn't taking unfair advantage of the poor little innocent.
Twonkey: Nonsense, Phipps. Alls fair in love and war.
Phipps: Youre right, by George. Ill do It!

the corner of the L on each floor. 
If the fraternity prefers, it can di
vide these floors into rooms ac
commodating two men with study 
and sleeping area partially sep
arated or they can utilize larger 
segments with a common sleeping 
room for 18 men on each floor and 
study rooms accommodating four 
men each.
The fraternity can exercise its 
own ideas of decoration and treat
ment within the walls of its house. 
Furnishings, including the kitchen, 
will be a fraternity responsibility.
Bids for constructing the first 
group will be asked next spring 
and ground will be broken the fol
lowing summer. Completion date 
is set for February, 1956. A sec
ond group on the east side of Car
negie Union may well be under 
way before then.
Cost of each unit is estimated at 
$115,000. Each fraternity moving 
into the first squad will make a 
gift to Carnegie Tech of 25 per 
cent of the cost. The other 75 per 
cent will be amortized over a 40- 
year period and will be paid 
through room rent charged to the 
occupants. Four fraternities have 
already requested housing in the 
first project: Beta Theta Pi, Delta 
Upsilon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and 
Kappa Sigma.
Other units will get under way 
when more fraternities are finan
cially ready. However, all twelve 
chapters are entitled to suggest 
modifications. A building commit
tee of trustees and the architect 
will consider these modifications.

think the Miracle Tip is the

the best-tasting filter cigarette.
David Wayne, Stage & Screen: 
"L&Ms have the best filter of 
them all. Miracle Tip is right! 
Theres nothing like it.

jt-bu**0-Isnt it time you tried the cigarette that is
sweeping the country .. breaking record after record... winning 
more smokers in less time than any cigarette ever did!
Why such success for L&M? Its the filter that counts, and 
L&M has the best. You get much more flavor, much less nicotine 
... a light and mild smoke ... because only L&Ms Miracle Tip 
gives you the effective filtration you need.
Enjoy L&Ms king size or regular ... both at the same 
low price. Like thousands, youll say'Theyre
