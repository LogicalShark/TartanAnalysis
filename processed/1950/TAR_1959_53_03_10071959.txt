Homecoming Reveals 
The Fabulous Fifties
Fraternity displays being planned and built now will 
exhibit a wide variety of themes due.to the large field of ideas 
presented by the Homecoming theme, The Fabulous Fifties. 
Each display will portray some important or newsworthy 
event which has happened since 1950 in conjunction with the
defeat o Grove City and the* --------------------------------------------
visitation of Tech alumni.
The powerful and impressive 
H-bomb will be used by Alpha 
\^u Omega as the theme for 
their display. The Tartans aided 
by the H-bomb, or perhaps meant 
to be presented as being as pow
erful as an H-bomb, will bring 
about the subsequent defeat of 
Grove City.
Beta Sigs
Beta Sigma Rho has chosen for 
their themes title, the expression 
I dreamed I defeated Grove City 
in my Maiden Form Bra. A Cari^gie Tech alum dreams that 
Grove City is defeated by the 
Tartans use of a Maiden Form 
Bra.
The~ conquest oi Mt. Everest 
will be the theme of Beta Theta 
Pis display. The race to the top 
of Mt. Everest is won by the Tar
tan hero as he manages to over
come natural and unnatural ob
stacles (Grove City) and obtain 
victory.
Delts
Charlie Brown Revolts is 
Delta Tau Deltas display and as 
coach of the Tartan team, refuses 
to babysit for his sister, Sally 
Brown, who happens to coach 
Grove City, and with plenty of 
free time, leads his team to vic
tory.
Delta Upsilon makes use of the 
race into space and titles their 
display, Blasting Off at Cape 
<0naveral. As the alumni look 
on. Techs Eggheads rocket the 
Wolverines way out into orbit.
Kappa Sigma
Kappa Sigma, having chosen 
political highlights of the 50s as 
their theme, plan to present a 
satirical political review of the 
50s through the medium of mod
ern television. All, of course, in 
conjunction with Grove City and 
the Tartans.
The Tartans will freeze out the 
Grove City foes in Pi Kappa 
Alphas display. Korea as the 
football field will be the back
ground for a tense scene where 
the Grove City crooks are frozen 
out of action by the Tartans as 
they try to make a goal.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will not be 
entering the display competition 
this year. Instead the time and 
money usually spent on a display 
will be given to charity.
Sigma Nu
Sigma Nu welcomes homecom
ing attendants and Tech alumni 
to its own pavillion at the Fifties 
Most Fabulous Exhibition, The 
Brussels Worlds Fair.
The Tartan Missile is being 
used by Tau Delta Phi as their 
homecoming theme. A sub-based 
Techite will heave the Tartan 
missile and blast Grove City off 
the field.
Theta Xi
Theta Xi will present The 
Weighing Game where Eisen
hower and Khrushchev meet on 
the balance of power. Returning 
alumni lend a hand in the fight of 
the fifties.
Scotch and Soda will add its 
presence to the homecoming com
petition for the very first time. 
Their theme, The Three Penny 
Clobber, will represent the story 
of Mack the Knife who portrays 
the spirit of the Alums.
Leading his band of Techites to 
victory against the Grove City 
Beggars. This is S n Ss version 
of the sensational musical of the 
fifties, the Three Penny Opera.
arnegie Trustees Approve 
New Fraternity Dorm Policy
Last Saturday morning, President J. C. Warner and other 
administration officials met with the presidents, alumni ad
visors, and faculty advisers of Techs twelve fraternities.
At this meeting President Warner reviewed the history 
of fraternity dormitory housing*
since its establishment in 1939 un:(jfc the then president of Carne
gie Tech, Dr. Doherty.
At that time fraternities were 
having a hard time financially: 
one-third of the chapters had 
folded up and many of the re
maining chapters were in straight
ened circumstances. Many of the 
neighbors of Tech and Tech ad
ministration officials urged the 
elimination of fraternities.
Dr. Doherty 
*/pr. Doherty believed that if fra
ternities were administered to in
sure worthy goals and proper 
personal and group social conduct 
and if they were placed in a po
sition where they could be finan
cially sound, they could be a con
structive force on campus. His 
views led to our present system of 
faculty and alumni advisers to 
fraternity chapters and to the con
clusion that the solvency of the 
copters would be assured if Carnegie Tech assumed the same re
sponsibility for housing students 
who were members of fraternities 
as it did for students who were 
not in a fraternity. This led to the 
present fraternity dormitory sys
tem in which students belonging 
to a fraternity chapter are housed 
in Tech-owned and Tech-main
tained buildings. Each individual 
student pays has room rent direct
ly to Carnegie Tech in the same 
manner as resident students.
The plans and policies for the 
design and operation of the new 
fraternity duplexes, which house 
at present six of the ten Tech 
chapters in the fraternity-dormitory plan, were formulated back 
in 1954 in several meetings in 
which the administration, trustees 
of Carnegie, faculty and alumni 
advisors, and active chapter rep
resentatives of fraternities met.
After twenty years of successful

Varsity Varieties 
Depict Tartan Win 
Over Grove City
During Varsity Varieties, the 
day before the homecoming game, 
Grove City will be going down 
to defeat seven times. Each so
rority skit, in accordance with a 
chosen theme, will depict the 
Tartan victory.
Alpha Epsilon Phi will present 
the Tech beat generation nix
ing Grove City with the theme 
beat dicing past years and in
stead want to make Grove City 
beat.
A Shot in Time. Chi Omega 
depicts the Wolverines as the 
polio virus which tries to paralize 
Techites. But Miss Salk saves the 
day, and the Techites become im
mune to the Wolverines attempt.
Tri Delt
A prospector and a penguin star 
in Delta Delta Deltas skit, Se
wards Folly Comes of Age, in 
which Texas, representing Grove 
City, and Alaska, representing 
Carnegie Tech, vie for the title 
of largest state. Half of the ac
tion takes place in Texas and half 
in Alaska.
Delta Gamma has intrigue and 
suspense in store for the Tartans 
when they meet the great Castro. 
His secret formula that brought 
him into power will be revealed 
and given to the deserving team 
to bring them victory in the 
.homecoming game. In a South 
American setting, dancing girls 
and rebel soldiers help to com
plicate the plot.
Thetas
In Rock at Jamaica, Theta 
enacts the Rock and Roll Wolv
erines as they attempt to over
come calypso and win top place 
in the musical world. A conflict 
ensues as the calypso clan holds 
its own.
The Wolverine poison becomes 
trapped in a Tartan filter! Kap
pa Kappa Gamma will present 
The Wolverine Pack.
In Sigma Kappas Andrea 
Doria two ships are sailing to
wards a port where the big game 
will be played, neither expecting 
to meet the other until that time. 
However, a collision occurs and 
the Tartan sinks the Grover.
Open House
Open house which was 
scheduled for October 27 has 
been changed to November 17. 
Therefore there will be eve
ning class on October 27 and 
not on November 17.
Girls Costumes 
Are Not Complete 
Without A Mum
Mums are a must for Homecom
ing since every girl attending the 
game should be wearing one.
As usual, mums may be pur
chased from the Cwens; fraternity 
men may buy them through their 
houses and independents, from 
Cwens in Skibo. The mums are 
$1.00 and will be delivered to the 
fraternities at 12:00 noon Satur
day. Independents may pick theirs 
up in Morewood between 11:30 
and 1:00 Saturday.
As Cwens are a non-profit or
ganization, the proceeds of the 
sale will be directed into a schol
arship fund.

Tonight, and tonight only, will 
you have the opportunity to hear 
Jose Iturbi, famed pianist. His 
performance at Carnegie Music 
Hall will open the music season 
for Pittsburgh. Sunday afternoon 
you will have a choice of hearing 
.either of the organ recitals be
ing performed at 3 p.m. at the 
organ in Carnegie Music Hall here 
in Oakland will be Marshall Bidwell. His guest will be Victor Hill, 
a Tech student, playing the Mo
zart Piano Concerto in C minor. 
Paul Koch will open the 65th 
*eason of recitals in the Northside Carnegie Music Hall with 
Ruth Ann McCoy, soprano, and 
Walter Beck, tenor, as his guest 
artists.
Art
If you dont feel like walking 
too far, but would like to get a 
look at the world of art, go to the 
Fine Arts building. In addition to 
the usual hodge-podge of sounds 
emanating from the music depart
ment, there are two current ex
hibits. Anni Albers Pictorial 
Weaving can be seen until Fri
day from 8:30 to 5:00. Also on the 
third floor of Carnegie Institute 
there are newsprint advertising 
graphics by Arnold Varga being 
shown until October 25. Ilustrations by Georges Roualt for Rein
carnations du Pere Ubu are also 
being shown at the Institute. Not 
wishing to slight the otner nail 
i tne world, we must mention 
Chathams showing of structural 
steel in Todays Architecture. This 
exhibit is in Falk Hall and can 
be seen until October 13 from 9:00
a.m .to 5:00 p.m. daily, and 1:00 
p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Sunday.
Symposium 
There are just a few reminders 
we would like to add. Tickets are 
still available for Film Arts, 
which presents movies each and 
every Thursday, and dont forget 
the Bicentennial Symposium on

October 9 and 10. This should be 
of great interest to anyone study
ing on the Carnegie Plan.
WRCT Presents 
Varied Program 
Throughout Year
WRCT began its operations for 
the school year 1959-1960 this 
week, and from the looks of it,
| your 600 dial is the spot to tune 
to every night of the coming year.
New talent, new shows, better 
engineering, and some $200 worth 
of new records, promise to make 
this year an eventful one in 
WRCT history.
Plans For Future
In the planning are a number of 
drama productions that are to be 
broadcast over the air. Also, dont 
j be surprised if you should hear 
i playbacks on WRCT of some of 
! the musical presentations that will 
| be given in Pittsburgh in the comS ing year. Most important of all is 
I th^ fact that WRCT is now doing 
i live broadcasts of all football 
games, and that they intend to 
broadcast all home basketball 
games.
There is every indication that 
this will be a year of good radio 
listening. Be sure to read the Tar
tan every week for advance no

tngmeermg ot microwave relay and carrier systems keeps Bryan Clinton s job interesting and challenging.
"I got the engineering career I wanted
...and right in my own home state
In 1955, William Bryan Clinton, Jr., got 
his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at 
Clemson College. Now Bryans with 
Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph 
Company at Columbia, South Carolina. 
Hes doing specific planning of long di9- 
tance communications projects involv
ing cable carrier facilities and microwave 
radio relay systems.
Bryan chose a career with Southern 
Bell over several other offers. There 
were three things that were most impor
tant to me, he says. First, 1 wanted to 
go with an established, growing company 
where I could grow, too. Second, I wanted 
thorough basic training to get started off 
right, plus participation in development 
programs to keep me moving ahead. And, 
third, I wanted to stay in the South.
After 15 months of on-the-job training 
in various phases of company operations, 
Bryan was assigned to the Engineering 
Department at Columbia, S. C. His work 
with carrier systems and microwave 
radio projects has involved him directly 
in the growth of the company. And hes 
broadened his experience through devel
opment courses in management, general 
engineering, engineering economy, and 
microwave relay systems.
I know Im with a fast-growing com* 
pany and I feel Im really participating 
in its growth, Bryan says. Whats more, 
Im getting the training I need to keep 
me abreast of new commujiications de
velopments and take better advantage of 
advancement opportunities when they 
come along.
Bryan Clinton earned! a B.S. degree in Mechanical Engi
neering. Hes one of many young college men pursuing 
rewarding careers with the Bell Telephone Companies.

Bicentennial SymposiumSense Of Humor 
Is Necessary To 
Succeed At Tech
Mortar Board exists to promote 
leadership, scholarship and serv
ice. These elements comprise the 
essence of college life. However 
after four years of academic ban
queting, we find that a student 
cannot succeed as a leader, scholar 
or extra-curricular worker unless 
one very important quality is 
present along with all else. That 
is, a sense of humour.
Its not easy to laugh at our
selves when we flunk an important 
exam. But, if we didnt learn to 
take it in our stride, the popula
tion at Tech would go way down. 
And when youre leading bravely 
along only to turn and find no 
one following you, well, the senior 
fence was not erected as a wail
ing wall. We realize the discour
agement of an energetic organi
zation eager to serve, and hitting 
up against broom-salesman-treatment. Its not really very funny 
but neither are sick jokes.
Look Carefully
Were not telling you to pre
tend you're happy when youre 
blue. Just look carefully at the 
! things youre blue about. These 
1 almost-but-not-quite-there years 
can be very depressing. Things 
which are in truth small and in
significant can bring factors down, 
cause apathetic dispositions and 
extend the line to the Bureau of 
Measurement and Guidance down 
to Porter Hall.
Remember, it can always be 
; worse. Remember, too, it may not 
be quite so bad as youre making 
! it. And perhaps youre crying 
; about it instead of correcting it.
! There ig pleasure to be found in 
j every college day if your mind 
is disposed to find it. Call up that 
sense of humour, Its important to 
study, its important to be always 
at your best. Its just as important 
I to laugh.

FOOTBALL: ITS CAUSE AND CURE
Is ext Saturday at the football- game while you are sitting in your 
choice students seat behind the end zone, wont you give a 
thought to Alaric Sigafoos?
Alaric Sigafoos (1868-1934) started life humbly on a farm 
near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both named Ralph, 
were l>ean-gleaners, and Alaric became a bean-gleaner too. I>ater 
he moved to Oregon and found work with a logging firm as a 
stump-thumper. Then he went to North Dakota where he 
tended the furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted 
to Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to 
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then to Ken
tucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat-toter). Then 
to Ixnig Island where he dressed poultry (duck-plucker). Then 
to Alaska where he drove a delivery van for a bakery (breadsledder). Then to Minnesota where he cut up frozen lakes (iceslicer). Then to Nevada where he computed odds in a gambling 
house (dice-pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera 
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
linally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tannery 
beating pig hides until they were soft and supple (hog-flogger.) 
Here he found happiness at last.
Scotch 11 Soda

Why, you ask. did he find happiness at last? Light a firm and 
fragrant Marlboro, taste those better makin's, enjoy that filter 
that filters like no other filter filters, possess your souls in sweet 
content, cross your little fat legs, and read on.
Next door to Alarics hog-floggery was an almond grove owned 
by a girl named Chimera Emrick. Chimera was pink and white 
and marvelously hinged, and Alaric was instantly in love. Each 
day he came to the almond grow to woo Chimera, but she, alas, 
stayed cool. m
Then one day Alaric got a brilliant idea. It was the day l>efore the annual Omaha Almond Testival. On this day, as every
one knows, all the almond growers in Omaha enter floats in the 
big parade. These floats always consist of large cardl>oard al
monds hanging from large cardboard almond tree*.
Alaric^ inspiration was to stitch pieces of pigskin together 
and inflate them until they looked like big, plump almond. 
These sure beat skinny old cardboard almonds," said Alaric 
to himself. Tomorrow they will surely take first prize lor 
Chimera and she will be mine!
Early the next morning Alaric carried his lovely inflated pig
skin almonds over to Chimera, but she, alas, had run off during 
the night with Walter T. Severidge, her broker. Alaric flew into 
such a rage that he started kicking his pigskin almonds all over 
the place. And who should be walking by that very instant but 
Abner Doubledav!
Mr. Doubleday had invented baseball the day liefore, and ha 
w'as now trying to invent football, but he was stymied l>ecause 
he couldn't figure out what kind of ball to use. Now, seeing 
Alaric kick the pigskin spheroids, his problem was suddenly 
solved. Eureka! he cried and ran to his drawing lioard and 
invented football, which was such a big success that he in
spired to go on and invent lacrosse. Monopoly, run sheep run, 
and nylon. * *

Editorial 
Is Cramming Encouraged?
The aim of the Carnegie Plan of professional education 
is to equip students to grow throughout their lives in profes
sional and personal sature and in usefulness as citizens. In 
attempting to so equip its students, it seems clear that Tech 
has adopted a policy which is above that of a sink or swim 
one. This concern is mirrored in the freshmen mentor plan, 
the existence of a Bureau of Measurement and Guidance and 
in the general attitude at Tech in tending to lessen the formal 
lines of division separating faculty and students that still ex
ist in many schools of higher education.
One sometimes wonders, however, if the system of ex
amination used in most of Techs undergraduate courses is 
consistent with these aims and ideals. In particular the ques
tion to be considered is whether the student is encouraged to 
gain as much as possible under the present examination setup 
as he would under alternate schemes. As the reader may 
have guessed, specific mention to cramming in relation to 
the present system is to be considered here.
Cramming
It is an almost uridisputable fact that the vast majority 
of Tech students resort to cramming at one time or another. 
Even more disturbing is the fact that many of the more suc
cessful students academically lean heavily upon this techni
que, providing additional time for outside activities and in
terests. There are few psychologists, instructors or even stu
dent who will attempt to argue that cramming is a desirable 
way of gaining knowledge, especially that knowledge and 
experience the Carnegie Plan attempts to instill. Facts, tech
niques and anything else learned by cramming are all too 
soon forgotten.
Nevertheless, is not the examination system used in 
many courses in which only four (in many cases only two) 
tests are given per semester a poor idea? The fact that 
these tests are few in number and are announced beforehand, 
along with the somewhat prevalent policy of weighting home
work almost zero except in borderline cases, seems almost an 
encouragement to students to cram. Under the present sys
tem cramming is so natural that anyone who finds he can 
achieve acceptable grades by this method, he has little in
centive to do otherwise. At present under this system, cram
ming is the most adjustive technique in the short run.
Alternate System
If instead if the present system, an examination scheme 
would be introduced under which several unannounced tests 
would be given throughout the semester along with a greater 
emphasis on homework, the student would not be left in an 
environment encouraging cramming. Instead he would have 
strong motivation to keep astride of class progress and to 
study each course on a regular basis. It is true that such a 
system would create an additional burden of grading extra 
tests and homework, but would not the result be worth it? 
More Tech students would take a great deal more away from 
their classes and retain it for a much longer time, better 
fulfilling the aims of the Carnegie Plan. J.D.S.

Letter 
To The 
Editor
Attitude
Editor, The Tartan:
Last Friday night, October 2, 
our campus was visited by a num
ber of students from the Univers
ity of Pittsburgh who were cheer
ing for their teams victory in the 
football game with U.C.L.A. on 
the following day. Quite apart 
from the question of whether any 
group of people should ride about 
in overloaded cars yelling at the 
top of their voices these stu
dents received a very unfavorable 
welcome from the Tech students.
The Pitt students received a 
full measure of catecalls, boos, and 
cheers for the opposing team. One 
cannot help wondering why an 
obviously friendly gesture on 
their part was greeted by us in 
such a manner.
Do we fail to realize that the 
days of intense rivalry between 
us and Pitt on the football field 
are long since gone? Dont we 
realize that students living only a 
few blocks apart cannot help hav
ing mutual interests, which could 
be exploited to the best interests 
of both? Dont we see that friend
liness on our part could reap 
worthwhile benefits for us?
My question actually amounts 
to this: Do we boo the Pitt stu
dents because of some supersti5L WloJern S.cene
Beat Generation
During Freshman Week, a newcomer to the campus was 
heard to remark, on seeing her first dramat, Is he : real 
beatnik? The young ladys dilemma is becoming quite com
mon, now that the sterotype beatnik is coming more ofteiy. 
to the public eye. Television, movies, books and other media 
of entertainment are being deluged by hordes of unshaven 
young men in faded jeans and unlipsticked girls in even 
worse-looking outfits. Everyone is talking about those strange 
creatures, but few seems to know just what they are and 
what they stand for.
Essentially, the beat movement is a revolution. Many of 
our generation have decided that the square world of tradi
tion, middle-class morality, success-orinetation,  and grav 
flannel suits, is not the best of all possible worlds. The revolt 
itself is not new; the lost generation of the 20s was an 
expression of the same sort. It is rather the means of protest 
which have changed.
New Values
Todays rebels are not seeking great causes; they dont 
try to change the world. They want only to find new values, 
better ways of everyday living. They turn to the philosophical 
of the east, Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Islam, in 
an effort to live in a better way* free from Western tradii 
tions. Their literature is not concerned with great themes 
and plots, but rather with the joys and terrors of daily (and 
nightly) life. Their music is not in the grand symphonic 
manner, but rather in the intimacy of the jazz combo. Their 
special language is symbolic, terse, usually monosyllabic, yet 
incredibly expressive to those in the know; beat, bop, dip, 
swing, kicks, drag Zenthese are the watchwords of the 
movement.
To gain a further understanding of these night-peopled 
read the words of their spokesmen, confusing though they 
may be: Jack Kerouac, Clellon, Holmes, Allen Ginsberg, 
Kenneth Rexroth. Listen to some modern jazz: Miles Davis, 
Lennie Tristano, Charlie Packer, Dizzy Gillespie. Better still, 
listen to their most successful communicators the comedians, 
Lenny Bruce, Shelley Berman, Mort Saul. Then decide for
tion or legend to the effect that y0urself whether their revolt is valid.
we are supposed to do this, or do - __________________________________________________________

On Fulbright Lectureship
By Rena Siegel
Dr. Norman H. Dawes, a familiar figure to Fine Arts stu: dents, is nowhere to be seen on Tech campus this semester. 
Long the main lecturer for sophomore HAC (History of Arts 
and Civilization) classes, Dr. Dawes is now in India.
He received his B.A. at Boston University in 1927, follow-,
! ed by his M.A. and Ph.D. at Har-*----------------------------------------------**
vard in 1928 and 1944, respectively. A member of Theta Xi and 
Phi Kappa Phi, he recently bej came an honorary member of Phi 
| Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity 
i because of his advisory capacity 
| and keen interest in music and 
the fraternitys activities.
He has a long list of honors to 
his credit, which include a Car
negie Teaching Award in 1952. 
This award, now discontinued, 
was equal to half his salary plus 
expenses for travel. In making the 
award President Warner said, 
The awards are given to the four 
teachers outstanding both in the 
quality of their undergraduate 
teaching as measured by Car
negies educational objectives, and
Requiescat In Pace
in their influence upon the teach
ing of others.
One of his favorite pieces of 
advice to HAC students was al
ways, Keep a list of books to 
read, and read every one. of them 
when you have time, you-knowwhen. (When is after gradu
ation.) While here at Tech he 
lectured to HAC classes and 
numerous civic groups in the trif% 
state area, including a lecture in 
1955 before the Tech Community 
Forum on the subject The Pres
ervation of Our Civil Liberties. 
In 1956 he was a tour leader for 
CIT students who took a summer 
j art tour of European art centers.
This semester, Dr. Dawes is 
traveling through India, on a Ful! bright Lectureship. One of four 
lecturers, he is the only one in the 
; subject of history. Asked by th.
: Indian Government and the Wash
ington office, he is currently at the 
| disposal of the central Fulbright 
office, and will probably remain in 
India for the remainder of the 
school year.
Flight
During his flight this summer, 
over Japanv Dawsie (as-he is 
affectionately called) was bother
ed by an attack of stomach ulcers. 
Following his recovery in ^ 
Tokyo hospital, he and his wiffe 
continued their trip to New Delhi, 
where they were welcomed and 
orientated.
If the perception of Indian stu
dents is as keen as that of Tech 
students, they will realize that in 
Dr. Dawes, they have a fine lec
turer, historian, and friend. Let's 
hppe India doesnt decide to keep 
him; hes missed here at Tech.

Ronald Craig Elected Evening 
Student Council President
Industrious is the adjective which best describes Ronald 
Craig, Evening Student Council President for the current 
school year.
He assumed this responsibility after having had the ex
perience of being Vice Presides ?----------------------------------------------------------
of Council and Chairman of the 
Evening Students Banquet, a nota
ble accomplishment in itself.
Three Insignia Awards which he 
received from Council are evi
dence of the work he has done on 
Council projects.
After having graduated in 1950 
from his hometown high school of 
Scottdale, third in a class of onehundred thirty, Ron entered Tech 
to work for a B.S. in electrical 
engineering. At present he is en
gaged in fulfilling the require
ments for this degree which he 
hopes to attain by 1961.
Employed at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in East Pitts
burgh, Ronald works as a techni
cian in the network protector en
gineering section of the assembled 
switchgear and devices depart
ment.
Surprisingly enough, he still I 
finds time for his wife and two 
year old daughter Cinny and their 
chief hobby: a new home which 
they purchased in 1959 and are 
now in the process of landscaping.

Expected Tuition Raise 
Due Next Semester
If you have been unaware of the potential increase in 
t\/i|ion rates, the 25% increase over 1958 rates may have come 
as a shock.as a shock. The anticipated raise to $10 per unit 
next semester will constitute a total of 39% increase over the 
1958 rates.
According to a recent survey^- 
by The Wall Street Journal the 
trend is nation-wide and includes
large and small colleges. Among 
those listed as increasing tuition 
rates are Boston University, San 
Jcfe State College, San Jose, Cali
fornia, the University of Detroit, 
and Mills College, Oakland, Cali
fornia. Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology foresees a possible 
boost in the Fall of 1960, as does 
Chatham College.
Follows Trend 
According to the report, the in
crease in college costs continue a I 
ir^d that began afte. World War j 
II. A four year liberal arts edu
cation at Harvard University now . 
costs about $11,000 compared to j 
$6,480 a decade ago. This figure : 
includes tuition, board, room, 
books, supplies, and allowances 
for personal expenses. At the 
smaller American International 
College in Springtield, Mass. a 
four year liberal arts education 
$7,328 compared to $4,188 a j 
decade ago.
Explanations 
The above mentioned 70% in
creases are in keeping with the | 
inflationary trend of today, how- | 
ever, explanations for increased | 
rates throughout the nation in- j 
elude expanded physical facilities, : 
air conditioned classrooms, build- j 
ings, and dormitories, as well as 
higher operating costs including > 
hi]#jer faculty salaries. Although 
night school students cannot en
joy the benefits of some of the I 
general improvements that are 
being made, they share the burden ; 
of the cost. Night school enroll- I 
ment remains high and in addition ; 
to helping the overall costs ofj 
operation the night school opera- j 
tion makes it possible for many | 
regular day students to obtain | 
necessary credits by attending 
n 0it classes. Full time night: 
school students have reason to be 
proud of their endeavors, not only | 
because of their sacrifices for  
self-improvement but because of 
their contribution to their com
munities and to the educational 
institutions which they attend.
Newman Club 
Vo Study Mass
On Sunday, October 11. the Tech 
night Newman Club will present 
the first of a two part series on the 
Mass. The speaker for the first 
week will be the well known Fa
ther Brennen whose Question 
Box appears weekly in the Pitts
burgh Catholic.
On October 18, there will be the 
^nd part of the program. It 
vi *1 consist of two movies, The 
Perfect Sacrifice Explained and 
The Mass is a Sacrifice. These 
movies are designed to illustrate 
the point which Father Brennen 
will bring out in his lecture.
The time is Sunday, October 11

Newman Hall, 125 North Craig 
Street, Oakland, directly behind 
St. J?!' Cathedral.
Recent Positions 
Show International 
Development Need s
Two recent assignments reveal 
the widely diversified needs for 
international development.
Dr. J. C. Warner was named to 
the research advisory committee 
at Westinghouse Electric Corpora
tion. Charles Olrea, of the School 
of Printing Management has as
sisted the International Coopera
tion Administration in the devel
opment of technical institutions in 
Thialand (Siam).
Scientists as well as economists 
are playing increasingly important 
roles in the history of the world 
today. The United States educa
tional institutions presently are 
! stepping up studies in the fields 
of science, language, and liberal 
arts in a rather undefined goal 
but with the knowledge that in: ternational growth is dependent 
upon keeping pace in educational 
standards. The question is where 
the most stress should be placed.
Russia is currently placing 
greatest emphasis upon scientific 
development. 65% of their young 
adults, are interested in science as 
compared to 1$% in the United 
States. Their government is cur
rently spending vast funds to pro
vide the education desired by- its 
youth. This development is not 
limited to young men. At the Uni
versity of Moscow 51% of the 
enrollment consists of women stu
dents in scientific endeavors.
National growth is contingent 
rpon diversified interests. Scienti
fic development alone is not suf
ficient but it cannot be neglected 
if national security is endangered 
and universal progress remains a 
goal of mankind.

Tech Strives 
For Victory
The coaching staff took advan
tage of last weeks open date by 
using the week to polish up Techs 
own offense and defense rather 
than prepare for this weeks game 
with Thiel. The Tartans were able 
to correct many of their mistakes 
after reviewing movies of the 
game with St. Vincent.
The fullback problem seems to 
be solved with Curt Burrell, who 
combines speed, power and shifti
ness. In addition, Dale Stewart 
should be ready by this Saturday 
and Gary Schwerzler has continu
ed to show progress in his con
version from guard.
Problems
The immediate problem con
fronting 'Tech is at tailback, 
where both John Zinni and Fur
man Smith are currently slowed 
down by injuries. Another pro
blem has been finding a lineback
er versatile enough to contain a 
wide running attack and defend 
against the short pass. The Tech 
secondary must also strengthen it
self against long throws, like the 
two which gave St. Vincent its 
two touchdowns.
The open date also gave the 
coaches a chance to see what 
shape some of our opponents are 
in. Thiel lost their game to West
ern Reserve, but Grove City, 
Geneva and Westminster won 
rather easily.
New Faces
It seems worthy to mention 
some of the newcomers with 
whom Tech fans may not yet be 
familiar. Mike Chuhran, who 
played guard here two years ago, 
is doing fine this year at left 
tackle and linebacker. Three 
other linemen looking for first 
year letter are soph tackle Bill 
Gilfillan, frosh guard Jim Morris 
and center Don Monty.
New ends who are likely to 
win letters are Cris Parsons, a 
soph being used at both end posi
tions, Pete Schlegel, who has been 
handling kick-offs and point con
versions, and Bob Rosche, a fine 
receiver who will also be playing 
basketball this winter.
The backfield has also been 
boosted by new faces. Furman 
Smith, whose father coaches at 
Indiana Teachers, has done a fine 
job in spelling Zinni at tailback. 
Two Sophs have given defensive 
strength to linebacker positions. 
They have given defensive 
strength to linebacker positions. 
They are fullback Jack Sloan and 
wingback Jim Selig. Two new 
tailbacks who may be seeing quite 
a bit of action against Thiel are 
soph Ken Sutherland and frosh 
Gerry Kosko.
A quick appraisal of the team 
shows that they are following pre
season predictions very closely, 
with unpredicted luck included. 
If they continue in this fashion 
they should wind up with at 
least six victories in eight games, 
the two uncertain contests being 
Geneva and Westminster.

points throughout the second half. 
Lack of substitutes hurt Citcom.
