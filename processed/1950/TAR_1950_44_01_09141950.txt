EditorialAn Open Letter To Freshmen
Its Up To You
You, as an entering freshman, are stepping into four 
years of college life which not only will be quite different 
from any other period previously, but which also will prob
ably prove to be the most important years of your life. 
Just how important and profitable they are to be depends 
entirely on you.
Your ultimate place in the world will probably be de
termined more by what you do in the coming four years 
than in any other comparable period in your life.
At the risk of sermonizing, we would like to pass on 
to you one sugestion around which this editorial is built. 
And that is to give Carnegie Tech the chance to do some 
of the things that it can for you.
Most of you are here in search of training in specialized 
fields. Carnegie Tech will see to it that you have every op
portunity to attain whatever your desires may be in the 
line of education. Although success in whatever field you 
are majoring in is of the utmost importance at all times, 
there is nothing so pitiful than to watch students go through 
college without taking benefit of the very many extra-cur
ricular activities and social outlets that are provided.
These extra-curricular activities and social events pro
vided for you are valuable in not only giving much-needed 
relief from the day-by-day grind of studies, but in also giv
ing you the opportunity to develop the abilities and graces 
which you will find indispensable later.
Industry has constantly complained that the engineer
ing graduate has depended too much on a proficient tech
nical background. He has failed to develop his personality 
while in college to the point where he could adeptly main
tain the necessary contact and communication with other 
people.
Working in activities ~ teaches cooperation with others 
under very exacting circumstances. It also affords the op
portunity for leaders of activities to learn something of ad
ministration, and how to direct others effectively without 
offending.
The college community has been richly endowed by 
your predecessors on campus; activities have been started 
and steadily improved, social groups and events continue to 
prosper so that you are able to find almost any kind of ac
tivity to satisfy your goal.
Chose your activities and social contacts carefully, for 
they will bear a great influence upon your future college 
career. Always keep in mind your particular goal in college 
and life, and never fail to remember that your academic load 
is a most important factor as to how much time you will 
want to spend with activities.
We urge you not to sell yourself short; give Carnegie 
a chance to do the many things for you that it is designed I 
to do. Although we all feel certain reluctance about taking 
the first step into something new, you should realize the \ 
opportunities you now face and do yourself the favor of I 
stepping up to meet them, starting this very day.
Freshmen Near Completion 
Of Orientation Procedure
Enrollment Drops 
As Vets Thin Out;
Frosli In Dorms
Approximately 3,000 students, 
including an estimated 630 enter
ing freshmen, are expected to en
roll during registration this week. 
Though this represents a decline of 
about 200 students from last year, 
the figure is still well above the 
pre-war high of 2,400.
In addition to returning upper
classmen, Fine Arts wrill receive 
between 175 and 190 freshmen, 
Engineering and Science 325 fresh
men, and Margaret Morrison about 
130 freshmen. The number of stu
dents with advanced standing has 
remained, as last year, at about 
225.
Though a housing shortage still 
exists, there should be no serious 
problems. Male freshmen are as
sured of accommodations in the 
dorms, in accord with the new 
freshman policy, while women will 
have no trouble finding ample 
room at recently remodeled Morewood Gardens. Greatest difficulties 
will be encountered by married 
students, while a slight shortage 
of rooms may exist for single male 
upperclassmen.
As Carnegie enters its sixth 
postwar year, the ranks of veter
ans are rapidly thinning out. Only 
about 10% of the total enrollment 
this year will be veterans, as com
pared to 30% last year. The great
est percentage will be, as usual, 
in the senior class.
Freshmen!
All Freshmen are required 
to attend their respective Con
vocation Assemblies which 
will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 
19, at 11:30 a.m. Transfer stu
dents are also invited to at
tend.
MARGARET MORRISON 
COLLEGE: Freshmen will as
semble outside of the Assem
bly Hall (Room 103). They 
will be escorted to their seats

Freshmen will assemble out
side the main entrance of the 
Fine Arts College by the sign 
marked E. & S. Freshmen, and 
will await the signal from 
Faculty Marshals to march in
to the Little Theater. If the 
weather is bad, they are to 
assemble in the foyer of the 
Arts College under the E. & S. 
sign. Freshmen will ptease re
main in their seats until the 
platform group leaves the hall. 
Recessional will be the reverse 
of the processional march.
Veterans!
The veterans office has been 
moved to I.H. 255-C. Mrs. Lois 
Harris is now in charge of all 
veterans records. Students 
who have occasion to tele

Sophomore Advises 
Bewildered Freshmen
Freshmen, your first week at Carnegie will be a new and dis
turbing experience. Having once been greenhorns, we upperclass
men understand your confusion; we want to give you a few words 
to the wise, hoping they will be sufficient.
No doubt you have received 
your dinks. Well, wear them, al
ways. You know, there are tales 
of freshmen disappearing sudden
ly from the dormitories on dark, 
rainy nights and, surprisingly 
enough, these missing freshmen 
were members of the why should 
I wear silly dinks club. A word 
to the wise should be sufficient.
Get In Shape 
Secondly, plebes, get in fine 
physical trim. Hit the sack early 
and do push ups every morning 
before leaving for class. By the 
time Homecoming rolls around 
every freshman must be a per
fect speciman, fit for the battle 
with the upperclassmen. This in
terclass competition pits freshmen 
against sophomores and juniors  - ,
who have been doing push-ups i ^ .
regularly for several years. A (J riPIltCltlOTl
Newspapermen
The Tartan has openings for 
reporters, photographers, typ
ists, proof and copyreaders, 
headline writers, and business 
personnel.
Though there are openings 
for all interested students, 
freshmen and sophomores are 
especially needed. Previous 
experience on other publica
tions will be helpful but not 
necessary.
A meeting will be held for 
all those interested on Friday, 
September 22, at 7:30 p.m. on 
the top floor of the Carnegie 
Union.
word to the wise should be suffi
cient.
However, dont concentrate on 
the physical and neglect your 
mental development. Always be 
ready to answer quickly yet re
spectfully to your superiors. For 
instance, if a senior walked up 
and asked, What are you doing 
here, could you reply instantly?
Exam Coming
In addition to answering such 
brain-racking questions, you must 
have a complete store of know
ledge on the campus history, songs 
and cheers because your tradi
tions examination will be given 
a few weeks after classes begin. 
Surely you dont wan to bear the 
stigma of a plebe who failed his 
traditions exam. A word to the 
wise should be sufficient.
One important rule that you 
must not forget is to stay away 
from walks reserved for upper
classmen. If you happen to step 
on such restricted walks you may 
be trampled by upperclassmen 
running to beat the last bell for 
class. Freshmen, do not hold your 
life in such little esteem that you 
would walk on restricted grounds. 
A word to the wise should be 
ufficient.
All Were Plebes
As freshmen you will find that 
eften you unknowingly say or do 
the wrong thing. You are bound to make mistakes, but be willing to learn. The upperclassmen welcome you; they want to help you find your niche in college life. 
Remember, those upperclassmen 
passing by, noses high, were once 
ire?*1 men too.

the Margaret Morrison building.
Put your t>esi loot forward for 
in Schenley Park. Those attending 
should meet at 4 p.m. in front of 
the informal reception for new 
students, Friday, September 15, at 
8 p.m. At this reception the stu
dents will meet Dr. Warner, and their ideas, 
other administrative officers. There 
will also be dancing and enter
tainment in the Fine Arts building 
where the reception is to take 
place. The name card issued at 
registration will be required for 
admission. If for any reason a 
student has been unable to register 
previously, he can secure a card 
at the Dean of Mens office before 
5 p.m. on Friday.

something new this year. A Tech

As Design Problems
An architecture students nat
ural abilities in design will be ap

year at Carnegie Tech. The new 
method of teaching, to be devel

R. Swank in conjunction with the 
architecture faculty, will be in line 
with the schools Carnegie Plan of 
education.
In describing the new program, 
Mr. Swank said, . . the con
struction of sentences and para
graphs will be attacked as design 
problems.
The philosophy behind the de
sign of a good building is funda
mentally similar to that behind the 
construction of a good paragraph. 
We will try to help our students 
s6e this similarity, and learn how 
to take advantage of it.
In the new program, students 
will have morning English classes 
three times a week.
In addition, Mr. Swank will sit 
in architecture design drafting 
rooms where he will criticize and 
coach students in speaking about

IM Football 
Season Opens 
September 26
With the opening of the 1950 fall 
semester at CIT the first important 
event on the intramural sports 
calendar is intramural football. All 
entries are due in the intramural 
office by September 22nd and play 
is scheduled to begin on Septem
ber 2fch.
The defending champs, ASCE, 
once again appear to be the team 
to beat. Two of their all-star backfield will again be on hand, the 
only loss to the team being that 
of Leo Schober, the hard-driving 
halfback. The team will be built 
around Dick Schober and Jack 
MacDonald, whose stellar passing 
arm led the team to the school 
championship last fall.
Practice has already started for 
several of the teams and, with 
good weather, this coming week 
should see the practice sessions 
really get into high gear.
Notice has been giv^n by the 
intramural office that copies of the 
new intramural football rules for 
the coming season are ready and 
that they should be picked up in 
the intramural office during this 
week.

Varsity Soccer 
Drills Slated To 
Begin Next Week
With the opening of a new sea
son of intercollegiate athletics at 
Carnegie Tech, one of the first 
varsity sports to gain the center 
of attention will be soccer.
Although the soccer team has 
lost such able players as Bill De 
Vos, last years captain, and goalies 
Carter and Clinton, Coach Patrick 
OConnor is anticipating another 
successful season. Coach OConnor 
is counting upon the experience of 
returning Plaid booters such as 
Jack Burrey, newly elected cap
tain, Ray Jenkins, Santiago Crespo, 
Bob Lipp, and Barry Wartenburg. 
Ward shows great promise as goal
keeper.
Practice for the Tartans is ten
tatively scheduled to begin on 
Tuesday evening, September 19. 
All interested students are wel
come to try for the team, especially 
entering freshmen with soccer ex
perience and upperclassmen who 
have played intramural soccer.
The first game of the season is 
to be played at home against the 
Frostburg Teachers, October 14.

whose 1949 team startled the foot
ball world by winning four games, 
losing three, and tying one, has 
expressed doubt that this years 
team can win more than two 
games. However, Dr. Baker has 
given a note of encouragement in 
his statement that if we can win 
the first two games without too 
many injuries, possibilities for a 
good season will increase.

both of whom played outstanding 
roles in last years winning season.
Even more disheartening, how
ever, is the loss of three gridders 
who were slated to play important 
roles in the 1950 football picture. 
Neither guard Larry Stovicek, a 
regular for three years, nor Elmer 
Metzger, who gave promise of be
coming one of the best halfbacks 
ever to play at Carnegie, will be 
wearing the Plaid this year, both 
being sidelined because of grade

from Colgate, was slated for the 
quarterback position- from his 
showing in spring drills, but in
stead will be devoting his time to 
the Marines. Leaman also was 
tabbed as the ace defensive back 
last spring.
Simcic Still Threat

stalwarts, Dr. Baker has at his 
disposal a fairly strong nucleus 
around which to build his 1950 
grid machine. Incomparable Nick j 
Simcic will again be the Plaids j 
top offensive threat. Simcic not | 
only will do a great deal of the j 
ball carrying but is also ready to j 
carry most of the passing burden. !
In addition to Simcic, the Tar- | 
tans have a host of good backs, | 
all of whom are capable of break- j 
ing away for long runs. Johnny , 
Luchok, Gil Dissen, Irv Shechter, j 
Arne Oberg, and Jack Magnifico j 
are battling for first team back- i 
field berths, with Luchok and ! 
Dissen curently holding the edge, j
At the all-important quarter- j 
back post, Quent Holtz is the num
ber one man at present, although ; 
sophomore Jack Brourman is! 
showing continued improvement, j 
Brourmans chances of playing, j 
however, depend to a large exteni | 
upon how well his injured knee j 
responds to treatment.
End Slots Filled
Veteran ends Lou Fougere and j 
Fritz Willbn assure Dr. Baker of ; 
experienced strength at the ter- j 
minal position. Freshman ends | 
Gunther and Pacos have shown | 
promise, however, and should add 
depth at that post.
The line offers the biggest prob
lem to the coaches, with only 
three-year veteran guard Floyd 
Wiseman returning from last year. 
Wiseman, out with injuries for 
much of the 1949 season, appears 
to be in good physical condition 
again and is expected to lead the 
attack up front.
Only one other line post appears 
settled, Clyde Stahle having won 
the starting left tackle position. 
At center Larry Krotec and Clyde 
Freeman are battling for the start
ing role, with Krotec showing the 
most promise so far.
Starters Doubtful
At right guard, Ray Shermeyer 
and George Rusnak are the two 
top candidates. Either Hans Lange 
or Joe Galanda will get the call at 
right tackle.
Due to the . lack of reserve 
strength, Dr. Baker has several of 
the gridders learning two offen
sive positons. Injuries to key men 
would hamper the team consider
ably and a successful 1950 season 
depends upon keeping the team in 
good playing condition.
With the opening of the 1950 football season just around 
the corner, loyal Tartan rooters are wondering whether last 
years successes were of a temporary nature or whether 
football is really on the upgrade here at Carnegie. As he 
did last year, cautious Dr. Eddie Baker has made the pre
season prediction of two Plaid victories this Fall, with more 
wins possible if the squad avoids injuries.
Naturally, it is hoped that the Skibos can continue their 
winning ways despite the loss of such experienced players as 
Gerry Meyers, Norm Keats, Jim Trautman, Bob Sommer, Larry 
Stovicek, and Elmer Metzger. Reserves are no more plentiful 
than they were last fall. Despite all the disadvantages, how
ever, the members of the 1950 team are confident that they can 
. equal, if not better, last years record. Certainly this is a healthy 
sign, for a team that has confidence in itself is not easily beaten.
Even with so many of last years key men gone, the 
Skibos still have a number of good players on hand, par
ticularly in the backfield. Nick Simcic, Johnny Luchok, Gil 
Dissen, Irv Shechter. and Arne Oberg represent a possible 
touchdown every time they carry the ball. Quent Holtz, at 
quarterback, can throw a ball half the lenglh of the field, 
although his accuracy can stand to be improved. Jack 
Brourman can be a tremendous addition to the quarter
back position if his knee can sustain the rough treatment.
Fritz Wilson and Lou Fougere, if they continue to improve 
as they have in the past two years, will be one of the best pair 
of ends in the district. Only the line remains a question mark 
in the eyes of the coaches, and this is due chiefly to a lack of 
experience. Floyd Wiseman, now recovered from a painful groin 
injury sustained last year, represents the only experienced line
man on the team. Wiseman offsets his lack of brawn with a 
great deal of speed and a tremendous competitive spirit. Tackle 
Clyde Stahle showed great promise last year, particularly on 
defense, and should continue to improve.
Hans Lange, George Rusnak, Ray Shermeyer, and Joe 
Galanda, all second year men, have shown signs of develop
ing into good linemen but also need game experience. Cen
ters Clyde Freeman and Larry Krotec, neither of whom are 
lettermen, still need a lot of work.
Consequently, we prefer to go along with the players 
and predict at least a season comparable to last years. 
Certainly there is a possibility of defeating seven of the 
eight teams on the schedule, with only Lehigh out of upset 
range. Therefore, four or five victories is not too much to 
expect, and, knowing that the team is out to at least equal 
last years record, we wish them the best of luck and pledge 
our support all the way.

Final All-Points Race At CIT
The traditional All-Points Trophy is a thing of the past at CIT. 
This year the trophy has been retired in the hopes that it will
cause a greater feeling of sportsmanship in the years athletic
contests. ?----------------- --------------------------- 
In the final standing last year 
Emanon was again on top for the 
second year in a row. Throughout 
the season Emanon built up a 
strong lead to hold their intra
mural supremacy on the Carnegie j 
campus, although they had stiff 
competition in all the various I 
sports. ,
Second place Delta Tau Delta: 
provided the greatest threat to the 
victors. The Delts fielded winning 
teams consistently through the 
season, although they were not 
able to overcome the lead built up 
by the winners. Close on the heels ; 
of the Delts was Theta Xi. The j 
third spot was gained by TX j 
mainly through their winning the 
school championship in softball in j 
the closing days of the school | 
year. This victory pulled them up i 
from seventh spot into the top j 
three.
In fourth spot was another | 
strong independent team, the 
Dorm Dukes. Led by Milt DeJean i 
and Dick Allan, the Dukes enjoy
ed a very successful season in! 
spite of strong competition.
