All Jaw Work, No Claw Work 
Another Committee Appointed
By Dick Christensen
Bob Mair, publications committee chairman, informed Student 
Council last Wednesday that the executive publishing committee re
commends that the Scots constitution be revoked. Mair charged that 
the Scot has not met costs (SC will have to assume a probable $900 
debt at the end of the year). He# 
went on to say that there was no 
Interest in the magazine and that 
It generally doesnt meet the 
standards of a college publication.
Action will be taken on this rec
ommendation at a later meeting.
Class organizations also came in for a full share of criticism. Al
though only two of the four class 
presidents attended the meeting, 
a lively discussion was held, with 
some Council members advocating 
the abolition of class organizations.
Suggests Revision 
Sam Cerni, senior class president, started the ball rolling by 
saying that he was in favor of 
having class organizations, but 
presumably this aid would take 
the form of a bulget appropria
tion such as is given to other ac
tivities. Larry Glavin countered by 
suggesting that a fee for joining 
class organizations be collected at 
registration to provide the neces
sary capital for projects.
Shirlee Ploeger, president of SC, 
summed up the general opinion in 
saying, In actuality there are no
class organizations, only class of
ficers. In the subsequent discus
sion the real issues of the problem 
often seemed confused and ob
scure, with few solutions being 
advanced.
Mair, among others, pro
posed that class organizations 
be abolished because there is no 
interest in them and they serve 
no useful purpose. Irv Shecter 
and Norma Trust favored the es
tablishment of college rather than 
class organizations.
Vague Resolution
After considerable further dis
cussion Council passed a vaguely 
worded resolution to support 
class organizations. Cerni, still in 
the dark about Councils real in
tentions, strove to clarify the issue 
by offering a motion to abolish 
class organizations. This was de
feated (10-6), and Mary Lou 
Mauroffi and Cerni were appointed 
to head a committee to present a 
definite plan of action.

Carnegies Kiltie Band
Gives Concert This Friday
Second Kiltie Concert 
Set For This Friday
The Carnegie Tech Kiltie band will present its annual Spring 
Concert this Friday at 8:15 p.m. in the Carnegie Music Hall. The pro
gram will be opened by the traditional Procession of the Pipers, 
and the concert will include Tannhauser overture by Wagner, Eric 
Knightsbridge march, ?Coates
the First Movement from Dvoraks 
N e w World symphony, and 
Tschaikowskys March Slave.
In a lighter mood, the band will 
play the Danse Russe from Petrouchka by Stravinsky, and se
lections from the well known mu
sical Brigadoon. Featured on 
the program will be Mendelssohns 
Fugue No. I, arranged for sym
phonic band by Mr. Schaefer.
Presented Three Times
This program will be presented 
three times by the Kiltie band. 
On April 23, it will give a concert 
at Coraopolis .high school. Two 
days later, it will present its 
Spring Concert at Carnegie hall, 
and the following Friday it will 
present this program for the last 
time in a concert in Beaver Falls, 
for the benefit of the Beaver Val
ley association for the blind. This 
marks the second time in as many 
years that the band has presented 
a concert sponsored by this *rganization.
At the end of this three-concert 
series the Kiltie symphonic band 
will have played before an esti
mated 6300 people this year, not 
including the Homecoming pro
gram. The concert band this year 
numbers ninety men, twenty-five 
of whom have completed three 
years with the band and are thus 
eligible for band keys, to be pre
sented at the annual band banquet 
this spring.
Greater Attendance Expected 
Last Februarys concert was the 
best attended of any the band has 
given since the war, with 1700 
present, a little short of a full 
house. Several high school bands 
attended in a body, and students 
came from as far as Wheeling and 
Meadville. An even greater at
tendance is expected Friday, in 
spite of television and baseball.

On Draft Deferment Situation
Tech students who wish a draft deferment are asked to get in 
touch with their local draft boards.
The deferment is the prerogative of each local board, which is 
guided by general directives from the national headquarters of the 
Selective Service office. ?--------------------------------------------------------
Tests, Standings Used
In general, class standing and 
test score (Selective Service col
lege qualification test) are used as 
the bases for considering defer
ment requests. Test scores are re
ported to the students local draft 
board by Educational Testing 
Service and not to Carnegie Tech.
Class standings are reported by 
Carnegie Tech to the students 
draft board, but it is necessary for 
the student or his school to write 
a letter to the draft board, speci
fically requesting deferment.
Procedure as Follows
The following procedure will be 
followed by Carnegie Tech to help 
those students who wish to request 
deferment for further study.
1. Before final examinations be
gin (May 26), and preferably as 
soon as possible, you should re
port to the office of Dean Jones, A.
H. 254-C, to fill out the first six
lines on a SS Form 109. Dean 
Jones has these forms.
2. As soon as class standings fo% 
the current academic year are de
termined, the 109 forms will be 
completed by Carnegie Tech and 
mailed to your draft board, to
gether with a letter from Tech re
questing your deferment.

Student Council Hashes 
Over Scot Organization

---------------------------------------------------

2TAMANTUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1952 0
Editorial
Lets Look Around
After hearing last week of the long discussion that went 
on in Council concerning the question of class organization, 
the old question of Carnegies Student Council joining the 
National Student Government Association again arose in our 
mind. Councilmen have always maintained that the associa
tion has nothing to offer them, but one of the representatives 
sounded a different tone when he suggested Council write 
to other schools and find out how they were handling the 
class organization problem. Pooling notes on common prob
lems is one of SGAs main services.
If our Student Council belonged to SGA, it would now 
be receiving literature concerning the student government 
problem at Notre Dame. After a small campus rebellion at 
South Bend, very similar and identical in purpose to the stand 
made by Joe Pecenka at Carnegie, the Irish governing body 
decided something must be done, and, after long deliberation, 
opened the issue to suggestions from the students.
One faction has recommended a set-up similar to the 
national governments, with a legislative and executive sec
tion, but this is being opposed by another group which claims 
the above too formal. This second group has offered a 
counter-proposal which could be looked into as applying 
to the situation at Tech. Using the Notre Dame terms, the 
suggested governing body would be composed of an Inter
hall Council, an Inter-club Council, and a Campus Regency 
board.
Each of the dorms would have two representatives on the 
IHC, commuters would have four representatives, and the 
campus at large would elect an additional four. The IHCs 
job is to take care of those activities that pertain to the 
student as a member of a hall or of a class, such as class 
dances. Each student would find it very easy to get his ideas 
to his representative.
The IHC is not the entire answer though, for there are 
other important activities that would want a voice in the 
government. Our present council does little more for them 
but audit their books and approve their constitutions. Here 
is where the ICC comes in, whose function it would be to 
aid the clubs and coordinate their activities. It could be 
organized to take into consideration the fact that each club 
is an autonomous unit, and yet numerous instances arise 
when clubs with similar interests are able to work together. 
The ICCs set-up would have the clubs organized into groups, 
each with a common function and identical purpose. At Car
negie a workable division would be: honoraries, social fra
ternities, professional clubs, publicity organs, etc. This would 
give the clubs a chance to come much closer to the student 
governing body and the administration.
In addition the Campus Regency board would be the 
final authority, acting as the Supreme Court. It would have 
general control over the finances and investigate the opera
tions of the IHC and the ICC. Its members would include 
the class presidents and students chosen by the twro councils.
The Regency board at Tech would do away with the inef
fective Undergraduate Advisory Council (UAC) and be the 
direct link between the students and the administration. 
Composed of more of the true campus leaders, it would in
sure the administration of getting a much better cross-sec
tion of student opinion.
Thus, by this example we hope it has been shown how 
membership in SGA would give CITs Student Council an 
insight into another method  solving its troubles besides 
trial and error. A change to the above type of student gov
ernment might be advisable at Tech, since the low number 
of votes cast in the Student Council elections means little 
student interest. If our Council would become a govern
ment of the students, by the students, and for the students, 
membership and voting interest would again bloom.
F. S.
Writers Discuss Spirit, 
Administration, Dr. Feigl
Editor, the Tartan:
Most of us, as students, find it 
easy enough to criticize and de
grade conditions at Carnegie, but 
are seldom able to suggest any
thing that would be truly bene
ficial to us and to the school.
Having been only too willing to 
complain in the past, I have for 
once hit upon an idea which would 
be, I believe, both feasible and 
beneficial.
It is the custom on some cam
puses for the administration to 
make itself acquainted with the 
student body through a system of 
open houses and similar events.
If the administration is to serve 
the students, it must know them. 
If the students are to be sym
pathetic toward the administra
tion, they must undersatnd it.
Here at CIT there is a definite 
gap between the higher officials 
and the students, particularly the 
rank and file. The ordinary stu
dent know Deans Dickinson, 
Schaefer, and David, but few if 
any of the other administrators.
When our registrar died last 
week, how many of us knew even 
his name before reading it in the 
local press?
Lets make it possible for the or
dinary student to meet the admin
istration informally, and to get 
acquainted. This would help both 
and would be quite possible. Why 
cant we give it a try?
Sincerely,
James E. Christopher.
Editor, the fTartan:
In these four years that I have 
spent at CIT I have noticed that 
the Tartan publishes complaints 
about the lack of school spirit on 
this campus frequently. All the 
ills of this campus seem to be 
blamed on lack of spirit. However, 
I have noticed that no one at
tempts to define school spirit. 
These various complaints seem 
to infer that school spirit is meas
ured by vandalism, drunkeness, 
and mob hysteria. If this is the 
measure of school spirit, I, for one, 
am thankful that the students at 
CIT lack it.
It is my opinion that school 
spirit is better measured by the 
friendly atmosphere present on 
the campus. A smile, a hello, a 
good morning doesnt hurt any
one and would be very helpful in 
bringing school spirit on our cam
pus. This friendly feeling that stu
dents could have for one another 
would greatly increase the success 
of school functions.
If the students can develop this 
friendly attitude on campus, the 
term Alma Mater might mean 
more to them.
Sincerely yours,
Robert G. McMichael.
Editor, the Tartan:
The purpose of this letter is to 
propose a challenge to the faculty 
and students of Carnegie Tech. 
The recent series of lectures by 
Dr. Feigl on the scientific method
was certainly timely, and very in
formative. Dr. Feigls exposition 
of logical positivism was well pre
sented and quite interesting, as 
witnessed by the capacity crowds 
attending his lectures. The suc
cess of the series seems indicative 
of a popular desire for more such 
programs.
Now my challenge is this: Will 
those same people who sponsored 
Dr. Feigl of the logical. positivist 
school be willing to bring to this 
campus a man of equal promi
nence, who might effectively dem
onstrate the merits of the oppos
ing, or objective realist school of 
thought? Certainly the majority 
of Dr. FeigFs audience wouH be 
interested in hearing more con
cerning the implications of the 
positivists emphasis on the scientic method.
Therefore I propose that an
other lecture or series of lectures 
be given here, with a speaker as, 
for example, Mortimer Adler of 
Chicago University, professor of 
philosophy of law, editor of the 
Encyclopedia Britannicas great 
books library, and a man of great 
ability and wide experience with 
the university audience. (See Time 
Mag., Mar. 17)
In this writers opinion, a fair 
and objective series of such lec
turers would represent a big step 
toward the improvement of the 
university atmosphere. The deci
sion ultimately rests in the hands 
of you, the student or faculty 
member, whose interest in such 
programs determines their success.
Respectfully,
Robert J. Lechner, E.E. 52.

vives. By the beatific smiles and 
benign nods of approval on the 
scientific faces I saw during the 
lectures, I suppose I am a lonely 
frown in the land of happy cyn
ics. By charts, graphs, and dia
grams Dr. Feigl eliminated the 
concept of the absolutists that 
truth is unchanging and also the 
other extreme of all truth being 
relative. He dropped the pearl 
that there are moral values 
Values dependent on human 
need. This is morality? If it be 
so, then if national nleds demand 
warwar is moral, Is this not a 
more palatable sop for John 
Deweys criterion for good, Will 
it work? By Deweys concept 
dictatorship, if it is workable, is 
good; crime, if it is workable is 
just, and brutality, if triumphant, 
is wonderful. By Feigls concept, 
if there is a need for dictatorship 
then it is moral; if there is a 
need for crime, then it is just; if 
there is a need for brutality, then 
it is permissible. If this be logi
cal or positive, then words have 
lost their meaning! If, as the em
pirics, pragmatists and positivists 
suggest, moral truth is only the 
contradictions men make, then it 
follows that the rights of the in
dividual are ridiculous; democra
cy a farce, and dictatorship justi
fiable. The world then is nothing 
but a technological institution! A 
butchery without morality! Oh, 
Dr. Feigl offered morality an opi
ate. He suggested that history 
shows us a stairway to paradise; 
that the future is a guarantee of 
achievement. While edcrying 
dogma, Feigl dogmatically insists 
we see in history human progress. 
Im sure that the victims of 
Dachu and Buchenwald and the 
Russian slave labor camps might 
take exception to such a conten
tion. I am afraid that Dr. Feigl 
is so blinded by the atomic flash 
that he sees technological ad
vancement as human progress.
No Freeu'*m
can be no freedom for all, if mans 
rights are man made. If mens 
rights are dependent on the needs 
of other men, man immediately 
looses freedom. If anything is 
empiric this fact is, that when na
tions, groups, or men discard the 
premise of God given rights and 
the obligation to sustain those 
rightsfreedom dies. Consider 
truth, the proponents of the relativity of truth are so enchanted 
by sciences opening the door to 
so many new discoveries that the 
discoveries become truth; whereas 
the truth existed before the dis
covery. Truth is existent in itself; 
discovery of it does not make it 
truth; as the world is the physical 
shape it is whether we judge it to 
be so or not. If God exists, He 
exists. His existence does not ex
ist in our admission or denial of it.

Good Heavens Music Arranger 
Well Qualified For Position
By Fred Sonnenberg
When I first met John Zurosky at Scotch n Soda meeting last 
year, I thought I was shaking hands with the faculty adviser. The 
club s musical arranger is often regarded at the board meetings as 
the old hand of the musical business.
John1 Zurosky
Another South Pacific?
John has enough experience be
hind him that one would think 
was in line for retirement, 
ing his six years as trumpet play
er and music arranger at the Stantheater, he set up the music 
for many famous bandleaders in
cluding Tommy Dorsey. Stations 
and WCAE also used his 
in the arranging field. 
Even Uncle Sam noticed Johns 
nd used him for a musical 
in the recruiting service 
and other branches of service en
tertainment. Anyone who has 
watched the Pittsburgh Civic 
Opera has seen some of 
ohns arranging on the stage.
A junior in music education, 
Johns job with Scotch n Soda 
(strange as it seems) is musical 
adviser. He has either done or 
supervised the arranging of all 
the pieces in Good Heavens.
His biggest headache though 
is the SnS orchestra. As-the time

dual track meet of the regular season and coach Guy Halfertys 
thinclads took advantage of the opportunity as they thumped a good 
Case Tech team 87-44. i
The win ran the Tartans vic
tory string in dual meets to eleven 
straight. The Plaid last suffered 
defeat in the 1950 season.
In posting their eleventh tri
umph the Skibos ran off with 
twelve of the fifteen first place 
ribbons. Johnny Luchok paced the 
meet with wins in the 100-yard 
dash and broad-jump and an an
chor man part in the winning 4/5- 
mile relay.
Bob Carman continued his bril
liant performance in the long 
distance events with victories in 
the mile and two-mile grinds.
Chuck Taylor was another dou
ble winner for the Plaid as he took 
firsts in both the discus and shotput.
Case took home some consola
tion for their loss in the record tieing performance of Jim Theiling, 
v.ho captured both hurdle events.
Theiling skimmed over the low 
sticks in a 12.5 effort to match his 
own record set a year ago.

Baseball Team Holding Practice 
Sessions At Schenley Diamond
Sixty-five Carnegie Tech students are competing for positions 
on the new baseball team that has been organized on the Tartan 
campus.
Coach Ray Haynes is now holding intrasquad competition in an 
effort to reduce the squad to 20#
players. These games are being 
held at 4:3.0 on Monday, Wednes
day, and Friday afternoons on the 
Schenley Oval ball field.
The spirit and enthusiasm of the 
players has been exceptional, as is 
evidenced by their willingness to 
provide their own share of the 
general expenses that may occur 
throughout the season.
The schedule will be designed 
to cover a period of about one 
month, the first regular games
starting on the first of May and 
the last having to be played before 
final exams begin. All g&mes to be 
played with other college teams 
and sandlot teams from the city 
will be announced in the Tartan.
Although the team is self-spon
sored this season, it is hoped that 
with abundant spectator appeal, 
and a record that shows promise 
for future seasons, the school will 
adopt the sport as a varsity proj
ect.

Tennis Team 
To Be Strong 
This Year
Weiderhorn Anti Miller 
Will Hold Top Spots 
For Plaid Racqueteers
Varsity tennis coach Frank 
Moses must be more than pleased 
with the prospects for 1952, in 
spite of his casual remarks that 
the team should be somewhat 
improved. With only the con
tests for the fifth and sixth posi
tions yet to be decided, he al
ready has the team practicing on 
the courts earlier than ever be
fore.
First Four Places Cinched
Bob Wiederhorn, a letterman 
returning to captain this years 
team, and Jim Miller, an out
standing freshman, will hold the 
first and second spots.
Bob Duffus, who sparkplugged 
the frosh basketball team this 
winter, and freshman A1 Glaser 
will straddle the third and fourth 
positions.
The battle for the No. 5 and No. 
6 spots is a hotly contested strug
gle among Don Duncklee, George 
Berringer, Carl Finder, Mahlon 
Saibel, and Bill Staufenberg, who 
are all anxious to place them
selves on the squad.
Bad Weather Slows Practice
The constantly rainy weather 
has afforded no opportunity for 
doubles competition, but this 
should present no trouble with the 
promising material that is avail
able. The large number oF hope
fuls who have turned out will give 
Mr. Moses a strong reserve from 
which he predicts some valuable 
players will develop. Hard prac
tice will be the order of the day 
until April 25 when the Tartans 
tackle Duquesne university. The

Professor Pulls Quiz 
On Unwary Alchemist
By John J. John, Jr., as told to Dick Ours tine
Each Thursday morning it is my duty as an irregular alchemist 
to attend, along with somfe 749 sophomore metaphysics majors, a lec
ture period for the physics department course in celestial mechanics, 
a sterling example of the Carnegie Plan in action.
And so it was that on one bleak#---------------------------------------------------------
Pittsburgh morning this April, I 
walked briskly into the cloistered 
chambers of Engineering Hall, my 
sliderule snug in its moleskin case, 
ready to hear of the beauties of 
celestial mechanics, ready to pry 
deeper into the mysteries of our 
wondrous universe. As I ap
proached the lecture room, I 
glanced at the lighted marquee: 
Prof. Roderick Dyne-Centimeter 
in Theory of the Yo-Yo, also Se
lected Short Subjects.
Sentimental Music
I took a firm grip on my volume 
of mathematical tables' and en
tered, taking an illustrated pro
gram from the liveried attendant 
standing near the door.
As I seated myself in the gallery, 
the orchestra played soft and sen
timental music while waiting for 
the lecture to begin, and Professor 
Dyne-Centimeter scurried about 
preparing demonstrations for his 
weekly lecture.
No Small Talent
The professor is a man of no 
small talent in the world of phy
sics. He wears the Order of the 
Briefcase with clusters, and has 
written countless books that are of 
no practical value and are incom
prehensible to all but- a handful 
of brilliant theorists (a great ac
complishment for a physicist). On 
top of this, to prove his great ver
satility, he has held the faculty 
backgammon championship for 
the past 21 years.
For those readers who are not 
aiready acquainted with the 
natural sciences, permit me to 
explain that physics is the art 
of neglecting quantities. It pre
sents a world of weightless 
cords, frictionless pullies, inductanceless resistors, resistanceless inductors, and assorted 
other useful but nonexistent ob
jects. The whole trick in phy
sics is to neglect as much as pos
sible, sometimes even the an
swer. A few students go so far 
as to neglect physics itself, but 
this is frowned upon by the de
partment.
The Lecture Begins
Finally the professor was readx 
to begin. He grinned up at his 
students, amiably patted the table 
with a meter stick (a yardstick 
with three inches tacked to one 
end), and purred, Gentlemen, 
today we will observe the yo-yo. 
The orchestra thundered a fan
fare, the gallery roared its ap
proval, little children waved 
American flags, and the lecture 
began.
He proceeded to demonstrate 
the basic principles of physics,

suspended from the ceiling. It was 
operated by the skillful manipu

brakes and levers, proving con
clusively to us that a yo-yo, hav
ing reached the bottom of its 
string, goes back up the other side. 
Less interesting acts were per
formed simultaneously in the 
other two rings. The talk then 
continued with assorted and unre
lated demonstrations and anec
dotes, as advertised on the mar
quee.
Alas, A Quiz
But it had been with an air of 
apprehension that we had entered 
the lecture room that day. The 
great dearth of demonstration 
equipment (only seven dozen 
pieces of apparatus) indicated that 
something was amiss. And true 
enough, after 30 minutes, Dr. 
Dyne-Centimeter leered happily 
at us, twitched his mustache, and 
growled, Now we are going to 
have a small quiz.

Spring Sorority 
Rush Season
Panhellenic Council has an
nounced that sorority open house 
will inaugurate informal rushing 
this spring. This is a new custom 
on our campus.
The open house is being held 
in Carnegie Union at 1 p.m. on 
Saturday, April 19, and Sunday, 
April 27. All girls who are inter
ested in joining a sorority next 
semester should attend on both 
days in order to meet all of the 
sororities.
This year there will not be 
open rushing. The informal rush
ing period which began on April 
16 has been shortened to the 30 
school days remaining.
Formal rushing in the fall will 
be opened with a Panhellenic re
ception which will be combined 
with a questionaire period. At 
that time the sororities will an
swer all questions concerning 
rushing.
Vets!
Veterans who want books, 
supplies and equipment for 
the spring semester should 
submit their requisitions to 
the Book Store before May 10. 
The Book store cannot honor 
requisitions for these items 
after this date.

book and a piece of paper on 
which was printed: Arrange your 
work neatly, write clearly, draw 
clear diagrams; credit will be 
given for quality of analysis, pen
etration of thinking, good profes
sional style, but not for correct 
answers.
Given a standard pinhead, and 
angels. If one pinheadful of an
gels must dance on the head of this 
pin at all times, find, as a func
tion of n, how many hours of rest 
per week each angel will get. 
Neglect friction and assume all the 
angels are of equal size and 
shape.
Good Professional Style
I worked feverishly on the ques
tion for 25 minutes, producing a 
masterpiece of vague statement, 
fuzzy description, and good pro
fessional style. At the end of the 
period, I scrawled the name of my 
recitation instructor, Dr. Heinrich 
Heliumcryostat, on the bluebook 
cover, handed it to a waiting 
graduate student, strode from the 
room, down the stairs, and out the 
door, glancing back for a moment 
at the three man eating pitcher 
plants growing in the window of 
the office of the head of the de
partment.
I straightened my toga, as
sumed a look of military dignity, 
and proceeded to my next class, 
prepared to serve as a subject for 
some eager but poorly informed 
senior learning the art of leader
ship, drill, and exercise of com
mand.
