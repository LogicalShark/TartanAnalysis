Twin TDs In Last 
Period Thrill Fans
By George Paris
- Techs gridiron Tartans came from behind in the last 
quarter to defeat a stubborn Theil team 14 to 6. It was the 
second straight game the Bakermen won with a last minute 
scoring spurt, as they scored 19 points in the last quarter to 
defeat Bucknell last week 19 to 13.
The Tartans did not play hard football in Saturdays 
game until they got behind and then pushed Theil all over 
the field. The team seemed too over-confident but did come 
through in the clutch when necessary.
^ Strong Defense
The first half found both teams playing strong defensive 
games with neither team getting closer than the opponents 
20 yard line.
Tech had their best chance when they took the opening 
kickoff and marched downfield to the Theil 20 where end 
Martin Poad fumbled after making a nice catch of a Muth 
pass. Theil recovered and immediately quick-kicked to get 
out of trouble.
Techs offense couldnt get moving and Their game was 
i^rred by several fumbles. Halfbacks Walt Majeski and John 
Zinni picked up good yardage through the Theil line but the 
Tartans couldnt get the yardage when they needed it. The 
score at halftime was 0-0.

M. J. Stevens Chosen 
Student Congress Yeep

ferty Bonini following her recent marriage.

ness at this meeting were the com
mittee reports. Nancy Tull, chairn^n of the library committee, exiMined that one of the major goals 
of her group was to act as a

student body and the library. They 
hope to be able to ease some of the 
problems that have been prevalent 
in the past.
Activties Committee

sible.
Homecoming Committee
Sally Lindsay of the Homecom
ing committee gave further de
tails on the forthcoming festivities. 
She mentioned about the fratern

Homecoming programs, and 
Harpo buttons.
The elections committee is con
sidering a new system for con
gress elections which was describ
ed by Joe Matis, chairman. Noth
ing, however, has definitely been 
decided upon.
Dick Brand and the public re
lations committee have set up 
some goals for the year. They hope 
to publicize Congress more widely 
within the student body while 
keeping it prominent in the mind 
of each student, help with commitmittee publicity, and keep Con
gress members conscientious in 
their job.

De Benebetti
Next Speaker
By Georgia White
Dr. Sergio De Benedetti, a dis
tinguished physicist and member 
of Techs faculty, will continue 
the All-Tech assembly program 
next Tuesday with the topic Sci
entific and Humanistic Frontiers 
of a Research Man. His lecture 
which will be delivered at 11:30 
in Fine Arts will be the second 
feature in the series Frontiers of 
Research.
Highlights of Dr. De Benedettis 
career include becoming a Re
search Fellow at the Curie Labo
ratory in Paris and having a series 
of positions with the Bartol Re
search Foundation, Kenyon Col
lege, Washington University, and 
the now famous Manhattan Pi'oject at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
In 1943 he was honored by be
ing selected for an expedition to 
study cosmic rays in Eritrea, East 
Africa, and was a Fulbright Fel
lowship winner in 1956-57.
Fridays Pep Rally 
Disa ppoints T artan 
Cheering Squad
A lack of school spirit and in
terest was exemplified last Friday 
evening at the pep rally. The Kil
tie Band, the cheerleaders and a 
handful of devotees met on Morewood Place and paraded up Forbes 
Street to the cold and empty Tech 
bowl. Since so few rallied there 
was little purpose to the meeting 
and the few faithful dispersed 
with a few minutes.
The Tech team deserved more 
than this! They had won the first 
two games and were trying for a 
third consecutive win over Theil 
on Saturday afternoon, which they 
won.
The purpose of a pep rally is for 
the student body to show the team 
its interest and enthusiasm. The 
Tech team certainly wants this 
attention.
The next pep rally will be the 
evening of the W. & J. game  
October 24.
Wednesday Tartan
In order to increase the effici
ency of the Tartan publication 
operation, the Tartan will be 
published on Wednesday morn
ings rather titan Tuesday after
noons, effective with the next 
issue. All deadlines and sched
ules will remain unchanged.

Fourteen students met and 
spoke with Vice-President Richard 
Nixon, key-note speaker at a Re
publican rally, last Friday after
noon at the Syria Mosque.
The students in the group were 
the newly-formed CIT Young Re
publicans Club. Carrying banners 
which proclaimed them as Car
negie Tech Young Republicans 
and pledged their supjart to can
didates Hugh Scott and Arthur 
McGonigle, they attracted the at
tention of the dignitaries present. 
After the rally, John Berg, spoke 
with McGonigle, who expressed 
his wish to help the new organi
zation.

A new political organization, the

283 Freshmen 
Pledge School's 
12 Fraternities
By Phil James
To date 283 or 42% of all fresh
men in day school have given 
their pledge to one of the twelve 
campus fraternities. Of the 204 
men who attended Freshman 
Camp, which amounts to approx
imately 33% of the men in the 
freshmen class, 59% of the camp 
students have pledged.
Two explanations account for 
these figures. First Freshman 
Camp tends to draw the out of 
town students, who are in general 
the Techites most interested in 
the advantages of the fraternity 
system.
Second, the students attending 
the camp are usually the ones 
most interested in extra activities; 
this is verified because most other 
student activities report a similar 
distribution in freshman partici
pation.
Varsity C 
Club Danee
The Varsity C Club Dance 
held last Saturday in the Tech 
gym opened the all-school social 
calendar. Almost 300 conples 
danced to the music of the Walt

A scholarship presented to the 
outstanding freshman of last year 
and the introduction of Home
coming Queen candidates in their 
first formal appearance were high
lights of the evening. Eric Otterj vik, president of the C club prei sented the scholarship to Thira 
Suwan, a Sophomore Printing 
Management major from Thailand 
i who played varsity tennis.
Seven of the eight candidates 
for Homecoming Queen were in: troduced by Jim Frazier, chairman 
of the Homecoming Queens Com
mittee. The candidates are: 
Audrey Sue Applebaum, Sue 
Bradford, Marcie Bridge, Jan Conj rad, Sally Ganong, Lana Kubasak, 
Pat Moore and Judy Perry. Each 
| girl was asked to tell something 
j of her activities in high school and 
to answer a specific question per| taining to Tech campus and fra; ternity life.

Reverend Weigel Advises 
"Trust Your Intelligence
The Reverend Gustave A. Weigel, S.J. speaking at the 
first assembly program of the year, last Tuesday in the Fine 
As Little Theater, said, You can trust your own intelli
gence. You can be sure of conquest because you are true to
your intelligence. ?-----------------------------------------------------
The Reverend Father Weigel, 
professor of ecclesiology at Mary

ed what many students termed an 
exceptional address toned to the 
comprehension of and application 
to the college student.Jhe premise of his discussion 
that whatever instruments of 
knowledge one uses after college,
it is the human personality that 
pushes us to our encompossing 
envelope. In the ecquisition of 
schooling, then, we gain a knowl
edge of the Divine.
Human Being 
The human being, according to 
the speaker, is I centered. He 
possesses a bundle of drives to get 
hkn out.
uite often, he went on, we per
ceive the Divine as on the edge 
f reality; that is, we suppose a 
God rather than understand him.
The Supreme Being is interpreted 
as in the very nature of things.
Many people regard Him as 
'You,* a Being with-whom they 
are personally involved.
From these two postulates arise
two beliefs, in the opinion of Fa
ther Weigel. If the Absolute is an 
It, the Supreme Being is like 
the inorganice, far removed from 
the eye, unthinking, unfeeling, and 
therefore unconcerned with me. 
When an adherent of this convic

done, he means Whatever will 
be, will be. He believes that he

SAIL ON, SAIL ON!
I suppose October 12 is just another day to you. You get up in 
the ordinary way and do all the ordinary things you ordinarily 
do. You have your breakfast, you walk your ocelot, you go to 
classes, you write home for money, you burn the dean in effigy, 
you watch Disneyland, and you go to bed. And do you give one 
little thought to the fact that October 12 is Columbus Day? 
No, you do not.
Nobody thinks about Columbus these days. Let us, there
fore, pause for a moment and retell his ever-glorious, endlessly 
stirring saga.
c/fcp/r,>5 eyec on
Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa on August 23,1451. 
His father, Ralph T. Columbus, was in the three-minute auto 
wash game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a 
sprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four 
brothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the 
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets, 
young Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices. 
However, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader 
and spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfor
tunately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time 
Care of the Horse by Aristotleand after several years of reading 
Care of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor 
reached him that there was another book in Barcelona, off he 
ran as fast as his fat little legs would carry him.
The rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona 
was Cuidar un Cabaf/o by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing 
more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going to 
India where, according to legend, there were thousands of books. 
But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and after so 
many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus never wanted 
to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought struck him: 
perhaps it was possible to get to India by sea!
Fired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to 
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Co
lumbus was plagued with little fat legs all his life) and pleaded 
his case with such fervor that the rulers were persuaded.
On October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World. 
The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders 
never before seen in Europespices and metals and plants and 
flowers andmost wondrous of alltobacco! Ob, what a sensa
tion tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had lfing since been 
invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew 
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer, made 
still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco in 
front of it, and invented the worlds first filter cigarette 1
rl hrough the centuries filters have been steadily improved 
and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate 
in the filter cigaretteMarlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece 
of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great filter, great smoke I 
And so, good friends, when next you enjoy a fine Marlboro 
Cigarette, give a thought to the plucky Genoese, Christopher 
Columbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole lovely 
thing possible.

Tzge 4CARNEGIE TARTANTuesday. October 1, 195*
Editorial
Publicize!
Why was the pep rally last Friday night a 
failure? What caused the poor attendance 
at the last meeting of that honorary? Where 
were the throngs which should have attend
ed the art exhibit? These questions have 
plagued the minds of the campus leaders 
since time began and have seemingly yet to 
be answered. And each year usually brings 
forth many statements from these campus 
leaders placing the blame on (um)  
apathy.
This year, as usual, the Tartan is placing 
the blame on apathyapathy on the part of 
the campus leaders; for too often the lead
ers feel obligated only to schedule and ar
range the various campus events and activ
ities and placidly assume that the rest of the 
student body will automatically attend and 
support these activities. Such is simply not 
the case, as is evident from the poor show
ing of some of the abovementioned events.
The Tartan feels that more attention 
should be given to generating enthusiasm for 
campus activities. Such generation has its 
logical beginnings with the person (s) re
sponsible for the activities, since without ef
fective and dynamic leadership, any under
taking is doomed to failure.

The next obvious question is what evidence is there that , _ _ #
shows that the campus leadership is ineffective? The answer j OlltClOOr liiCIllCcltlOJl
is that there is too little publicity for most campus wide Keynote Of The
events. The Tartan receives much too little material of the * 
press release variety to adequately cover the programs of West Penn Conf.
[continued on page 7] Outdoor Education was the 
theme of the Western Pennsylva
nia Education Conference, held 
last Friday, October 10, in Pitts
burgh.
The program was held in Pitts
burgh through the cooperation of
Carnegie Tech and the Univers
ity of Pittsburgh. It began with a 
luncheon at the First Baptist 
Church, at Bayard and Bellefield 
Avenues, and was followed by an 
afternoon meeting consisting of a 
three-phase outdoor education 
program.
Speakers
At the luncheon Dr. Jack 
George, of the Roslyn Public 
School system of New York, spoke 
on the topic of Outdoor Educa
tion in the Schools. The after
noon meeting was held on the 
Carnegie Tech practice field by 
Forbes Avenue. This three-phase 
meeting consisted of outdoor cook
ery, nature crafts, and casting.
Mrs. Marguerite Duball, of 
Pennsylvania State University, 
handled the outdoor cooking 
phase. Mr. David Hart, of the 
Missakickox Trailside Museum, 
was in charge of nature crafts and 
the casting portion of the program 
was handled by Mr. O. T. Rosencraus of the Pittsburgh Casting 
Club.
Theme
The conference theme, on Out
door Education, relatively new 
to the Pittsburgh area, was a fine 
opportunity for faculty members 
to gain new insight into the possi
bilities of incorporating outdoor 
education in school curriculum.

Editor, the Tartan:
Just Wanted to tell you that I 
thoroughly enjoyed your amusing 
editorial on 12:30,s at Morewood

ing your incredible conclusions in 
the second editorial, it has dawned 
on me that possibly you are ser

I feel that such earnest endeav

not meet with the silence that 
followed your first article. So I 
am writing this letter to encour

Now, perhaps, you could try 
your hand at something like The
In this era of speed, automation, and pr^- 
duction-line-living, it is vastly important 
that one avoids complete mechanization of 
the individual. This is best accomplished 
through the simple, oft taken for granted 
medium of friendship.
In the Little Prince, Saint-Exupery illus
trates his grasp of this situation with the 
poignant interchange between the little 
prince and the fox. After the little prince 
mentions his quest for friends, the sagaciolfe 
fox speaks of the necessity of taming. He 
defines taming as'an act too often neglected; 
it means to establish ties. The fox continues, 
pointing out that at the time of their meet
ing, the little prince was nothing more than 
a little boy just like a hundred thousand 
others; and that he, the fox, was nothing, 
more than a fox like a hundred thousand 
others. Neither had need of the other. If tie 
prince were to tame the fox, however, each 
would have need of the other and to each 
the other would be unique. The fox con
cludes with the idea that only one under
stands the things that one tames.
Men have no more time to understand 
anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But 
there is no shop in the world where one can buy friendships. 
Even Machiavelli understood this when he said, Friends )p 
which is gained by purchase and not through grandeur and 
nobility of spirit is bought but not secured.
As Saint-Exupery suggests, friendship, i. e. this under
standing; should unfold gradually. A companion possesses a 
dark grey flannel suit which from a distance appears to be 
rather common. As one draws nearer, he is pleased to find in
stead a suit of subtle dark grey plaid. On even closer in
spection brought about by the pleasant sensation of finding 
more than had been anticipated, one finds a single bide 
thread running through the plaid. How much more interest
ing is this series of reactions to visual stimuli than to see a 
suit of large black and white checks. Ones vision is assaulted 
from a distance; propinquity contributes nothing to what has 
been observed at first glimpse. Certainly all of us have oc
casioned the black and white check individual who reveals 
his complete self in a matter of seconds (and also usually a 
very impressive life history!) Does one feel attracted to this 
individual? Most likely not. One is generally satisfied Wx^il 
the glimpse from a distance. Thus the wise friend-to-be per
mits judicious revelation of his finer attributes, his inner 
thoughts and feelings; the whole of his personality.
The sensitive man will take the time and the patience 
to develop friendship and hence understanding.

Cross-Country Team 
Remains Undefeated
Techs undefeated cross country team roared to its third 
and fourth victories this week as they rolled over Waynesburg and Geneva. Techs entire ten man squad crossed the 
finish line ahead of the first Waynesburg man as they easily
chalked up a 15-50 shutout on^----------------------------------------------------
Monday. On Thursday against the
once powerful Geneva Covies the 
Tech Harriers again swept to a dee0ve victory, winning 17-45. The 
best Geneva could do was fourth 
place behind Techs front running 
senior trio Dick Hamilton, EricOttervik, and Bill Wittman. Run
ning together, Ottervik, Hamilton, 
and Wittman built up an early 
lead and were never challenged. 
After Genevas first man came 
Woody Fritz, Bill Anderson and 
Finn Blomquist finishing strong 
ahead of the rest of the tiring 
Hfcaver Falls crew. Tech wound 
up the meet with 9 out of the first 
twelve places.

straight decisive victories. Due to
Cratsley Optimistic 
In B-Ball Outlook 
j^or Coming Season
By Stan Zionts
Usually pessimistic Carnegie 
Tech basketball coach, Mel Crats
ley, is anything but pessimistic 
about the prospects for his teams 
coming season.
Coach Cratsley has six returning 
lettermen and several other prom
ising returnees and newcomers. 
He does, however, have the seem
ingly inevitable Tech problem of 
Wbk of depth on the team, and is 
still waving the welcome mat for 
any new candidates.
Tartan Squad 
Although the Tartan squad is 
relatively young, it is not at all 
inexperienced. Junior Mike Flynn 
is a two-letter winner, while Bud 
Miller, Tom Mueller, Stan Skalka, Andy 'Komer, and Bill Soffa 
have each been awarded one. Be
cause of a severe shortage of reW-rves last year, the letter-winners played for a major part of 
most of the game. Tom Huff and 
; Ted Williams, outstanding on the 
freshman squad last year, look 
like promising outside men.
The freshman prospects are not 
as good. While 23 freshmen show
ed up for practice on September 
 29, only eleven held high school 
letters. From past experiences it 
K known that approximately half 
% the freshmen will drop the 
team before the season is well 
underway.
Freshman
Outstanding frosh from early 
reports include: Bob Hauser,
Duquesne High School; Lelan 
Jamison, Hopkins (Minnesota) 
High School; Don Brosius, Aspinwall High School; Bob Quain, 
Binghamton (NY) High School; 
Jim Tomlinson, Dormont High 
%chool; and Dom Perrata, Mc
Keesport High School.
The frosh play a 12-game 
schedule highlighted by contests 
against the Pitt, Duquesne, and 
W & J freshmen. The varsity 
schedule, which includes ten 
home contests is listed as follows: 
Dec. 1*Duquesne 
Dec. 3 Indiana S.T.C.
(Home)
early season injuries suffered by 
team co-captains, Ottervik and 
Hamilton, the winning times have 
not been spectacular. Instead, the 
Tartans outstanding feature has 
been their fine team balance. As 
an illustration, Freshman Dave 
Degerthardt running as Techs 
anchorman, has been posting times 
comparable to- those of last years 
third man. This kind of depth 
makes the 1958 Harriers a strong 
contender for the West Penn Con
ference and Tri-State honors. The 
first real test will come on Satur
day as Tech travels to Slippery 
Rock. Beaten only by Pitt, the 
Teachers are very strong this 
year, so Saturdays meet will be 
a tough one.
Tech is scheduled to run Case 
Tech today. The meet will be held 
in Schenley Park with the race 
starting at 4:00 p.m. on Flagstaff 
Hill. The Tartans are heavily 
favored to win.
Thus far:
Tech 15*, Jeannette 50 
Tech 17. Duquesne 46 
Tech 15,. Waynesburg 50 
Tech 17, Geneva 45
* Low score wins.
Favorites Winning 
In IM Football
In the second week of football 
action, favored teams continued to 
win with ease.
The Yankee league is being do
minated by Kappa Sigma and the 
Englishmen. Both teams won by 
superior margins last week and we 
are looking for them to finish 
one-two in this league.
Kappa Sigs attack is lead by 
quarterback Jim Hildebrand and 
end Don Casey. This combo led 
them to an easy victory over Citcom last week.

Tech Defeats Thiel
[continued from page 1]
The third quarter found both teams playing the same 
type of game. The cold windy weather was responsible for 
several fumbles and dropped passes which the ends couldn t 
hold on to.
With two minutes remaining in the quarter Mu*h drop
ped back to pass and was hit hard and fumbled. The ball was 
grabbed in mid air by Their Guard Rossetti and he ran 40 
yards with it for the first score. Theil tried to pass the extra 
point, but Jim Temmel intercepted the pass to keep the score 
at Theil 6 Carnegie 0.
Pass Intercepted
The Tartans couldnt move the ball after the kickoff and 
punted to Theil. On the third play from scrimmage, Muth 
intercepted a Peckich pass and returned it 30 yards to the 
Theil 45 yard line.
A keyed up Tech offense moved the ball quickly downfield with key runs coming on end sweeps by Zinni and Muth, 
and a Muth to Wilson pass also getting a key first down.
With second and 8 on the Theil 13 yard line, Muth faked 
a center plunge and threw to Zinni in the flat. With Poad pro
viding a key block Zinni went over for the score. Majeski 
kicked the point to give Tech a 7-6 lead.
A hard tackle by Zinni shook the ball loose from Jeckich 
who returned Hammers kickoff and Tech recovered his 
fumble on the midfield stripe.
With Jim Muth directing the offense the Skibos again 
moved quickly downfield and scored on a 10 yard end sweep 
by Zinni. The Tech line was largely responsible for the gains 
as they pushed the Theilmen all over the field. Majeski again 
made the point and Tech took a 14-6 lead.
Theil moved deep downfield to the Tartan 25 yard line, 
but time was running short and quarterback George Peckich 
had to try for a long pass for the score. He tried to throw 
three times and each time was caught in his own backfield 
by a hard charging Tartan line led by Dave Love and Gary 
Yarborough. Time ran out with Tech in possession on their 
own 40 yard line.
It was a great victory fprMhe Tech team as they again 
showed that they can come through when the chips are 
down. With hopes of having an undefeated untied season the 
Tartans take on Indiana State Teachers-next week at Indiana 
and were looking for Tech to win in a rout.
and Karl Mandry. TX also won 
their game with SAE B by a 
38 to 23 score. Eddie Davis and 
Bob Patton lead the TX attack.

The Pirate League found teams 
playing wily and wooly football 
and pre-season favorite Delta Tau 
Delta was upset by a fired up Phi 
Kappa team 9 to 7.
The Met Grads won a hard
fought game from SAE 21 to 16 
with a last quarter pass to Raab 
providing the margin of victory. 
SAE lead throughout most of the 
game behind the fine running and 
passing of Chuck Vodvarka.
ATO the other strong team in 
this league tromped over Theta Xi 
by a 33 to 8 score. The ATO at
tack was lead by Fred Garibaldi, 
Nick Sopkovich and George Paris.
Carman Stars 
In Marathon
Tech cross-country coach and 
national star distance runner Bob 
Carman added another accom
plishment to his long list of great 
running feats by placing second 
in the New Jersey International 
Marathon Race held at Jersey City 
last Saturday.
It was the first time Carman 
had attempted the grueling 26- 
mile 385 yard run and he came 
through with flying colors. Olym
pic star Johnny Kelly won the 
event finishing nine minutes ahead 
of Carmans time.
First Marathon
Previously Carman had never 
participated in races longer than 
fifteen miles, and he is recognized 
as one of the countrys top six 
milers.
Before the race, Carman told 
this reporter that he would feel 
satisfied to simply finish the gruel
ing race. In winning he defeated 
some of the greatest marathon 
runners in this and foreign coun
tries.

sidered a must game for the 
Yanks. Only once before in the 
histry of the seven game world 
series had a team rallied to win 
after being down 3 games to 1.
Again, pitching was the eye 
catcher as both Spahn and Ford 
were sharp. Ford, however, was 
deprived of victory once again as 
a shaky Yankee defense led Spahn 
to a 3-0 win. Yet, in all fairness 
to Spahn, he certainly deserved 
to win as he registered one of the 
best pitched games in series his
tory, a neat two-hitter. Brave 
rooters now found themselves in 
the enviable position of leading 
the Yanks three games to one.
Stengel
Casey Stengel, defying the odd 
makers, gave the nod to Turley 
while Fred Haney kept applying 
the pressure by naming Burdette 
to hurl the fifth game. For the 
third straight day a shut out was 
seen at the Stadium. This time 
Turley administered it, a 7 to 9 
blanking of the Braves while Gil 
McDougald, the most underrated 
player in the game provided the 
bulk of the hitting.
With another day off for trav
eling, the series returned to Mil
waukee. Brave fans were really 
hooting it up, after all, they still 
had two games in which to get 
their one needed victory.
Sixth Game
After the first five games by 
which the Braves held a three to 
two game bulge and especially in 
view of the atrocious fielding the 
the Yankees, none was prepared 
for the amazing sixth game which,
for sheer drama, must go dowries 
one of the greatest in World SJcies history. Both Stengel and 
Haney played into the hands of 
the second-guessers by again 
naming Ford and Spahn to do 
the twirling.
This meant both were coming 
back on only two days rest. Ford 
was not equal to the occasion as 
he was relieved by Art Ditmar in 
the second inning. Through Ditmars tremendous relief work the 
Yanks found themselves in a 3).Jo
2 ball game at the end of 5^4 
innings.
Secret Ambition
Every major league pitcher has 
at least one secret ambition and 
that is to win a World Series 
game. Some of baseballs most tal
ented have never realized this 
hope because they lacked the op
portunity, but Ryne Duren, the 
weak-eyed strong-armed, relief 
specialist for the Yankees,, had

most groups now active on campus. The Tartan is a newspa
per set up to relay to the students in general the programs 
of all the campus organizations. Its very existence depends 
on this need for a means of communication which can convey 
to all parts of the Tech Community the interests and pro
grams of the various groups on campus. The Tartan earnestly 
desires to fill this need. However, it can have little success 
without being given the necessary information about the 
various groups and their programs. The very lack of this type 
of information from a vast majority of the organizations on 
campus indicates a terrible feeling of apathy among the of
ficers of these organizations.
It is difficult to understand this lack of publicity ex
cept in terms of poor leadership. For example, the Tartan 
has received little or no publicity information from the 
Homecoming Committee! Likewise, the Tartan was not in
formed of the last pep rally.
The Tartan is anxious to aid any campus or campus re
lated activity in publicizing its events. It is anxious to aid 
any group in promoting interest in its affairs. But the Tartan 
cannot do this job single handedly. It must have the support 
and cooperation of the leaders and publicity chairmen of each 
campus group. For without such cooperation events will pass 
unnoticed and organizations will be inffective.

EXPANSION PROGRAM 
OPENS UP MANY NEW 
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
Dont forget the extras of an em
ployee benefit program when you com
pare the job offers and salaries of 
different companies. At Du Pont, these 
extras mean added income that doesnt 
always meet the eye. They include 
life insurance, group hospitalization 
and surgical coverage, accident and 
health insurance, pension plan and 
paid vacation.
In addition, the Company sponsors 
a thrift plan. After two years of serv
ice, for every dollar you invest in 
U. S. Savings Bonds the Company sets 
aside 25 cents for the purchase of 
common stock in your name. Roughly,
60,000 of our employees are now par
ticipating in this plan.

The location of your first assignment 
with DuPont depends on your quali
fications and on the openings in your 
field, but every effort is made to match 
the job and the location with your 
preference. The chances for a success
ful match are good.
Today there are men and women 
carving out careers with DuPont at 
more than 75 plants and nearly 100 
laboratories spread throughout 26 
states. Last year the Company spent 
$220 million for new plants and for 
increased capacities at existing instal
lations. This year new plants have 
already been put into operation in 
Virginia and Michigan. Six more 
are under construction. Others are 
planned for the near future.
Most DuPont units, it is true, are 
located east of the Mississippi. Com
pany headquarters, for example, along 
with many labs and plants, are located 
in and around Wilmington, Delaware, 
which is a pleasant residential area 
within easy reach of Washington, 
Philadelphia and New York. But there 
are also plants and laboratories in 
California, Iowa, Kansas and Texas, 
and plants in Colorado, Missouri and 
Washington.
Wherever youre assigned, youll be 
proud of the DuPont Company both 
on and off the job. Youll find the 
people you work with friendly, stimu

opportunity and made the most 
of it. He entered the game in the 
sixth inning and proceded to 
match Spahn pitch for pitch.
The score remained at 2-2 until 
the tenth when Gil McDougald 
opened with a four-master. Three 
singles later the Yanks had an
other run and Spahn, that 37- 
year-old veteran, was receiving a 
tremendous ovation from the ca
pacity crowd at County Stadium 
as he left the mound. That was all 
the scoring the Yanks did but 
with Duren pitching it looked 
plenty big. However, the Braves 
were not ready to quit. With two 
down they scored a run to move 
within one run of the Yankees.
Loss
Duren. although he had struck 
out 8 in four and two-third in
nings was removed in favor of 
Bob Turley, who recorded the 
final out as pinch hitter Torre 
sent a soft liner to Gil McDoug
ald. The defeat was, of course, a 
heartbreaker for Spahn. He had 
won the opener in ten innings and 
tossed a two-hitter to take the 
fourth game in New York. He 
might have made this one. too, 
had his fielding support been 
stronger.
Of all sporting events none can 
match the drama of a seventh 
game in a World Series. It is a 
whole year wrapped up in one 
game. All the money, marbles, 
and chalk are at stake. For both 
teams there is no tomorrow. The 
seventh game of the 1958 Series 
was in all respects except the 
setting a repeat performance of 
the 1957 seventh game. The teams 
were the same and the pitchers 
were the same. However, the re
sult was different. In 1957 Lew 
Burdette had shut out the 
Yankees. In 1958 the Yankees, 
led by the strong relief pitching 
of Bob Turley, who gave up but 
two hits in six and two thirds in
nings, beat the Braves 6-2 to re
turn the World Championship to 
Yankee Stadium for the 18th time.
Spahn, Burdette, Turley, Ford, 
and Duren all pitched well in the 
series. The Yankees batting stars 
were Gil McDougald, Hank 
Bauer, Bill Skowron, and Elston 
Howard. The Braves were led by 
their great young player Hank 
Aaron. In the final analysis, the 
success of the Yankees was due 
to their ability to use one of their 
old trade marks, that being the 
long ball. They hit 10 home runs 
compared to only three for the 
Braves.
The victory was especially en
joyable to Casey Stengel. Openly 
criticized for losing the 57 series 
he rallied his team to put on the 
most sensational rally in World 
Series history.
