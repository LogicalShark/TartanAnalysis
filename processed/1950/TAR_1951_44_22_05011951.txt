unusually capable hands.
SnS Talks It Over
First Performance Next Wednesday 
* * * *
New Location;, Best Of Talent 
Combined In UA Merry Chase
Just how good any show is a matter of conjecture until the 
curtain rings down on the first performance. This will, undoubtedly, 
be the case with, A Merry Chase, Scotch n Sodas ninth annual
production slated for May 9 and 10 performances at Schenley HS
auditorium. ? '
Never-the-less, there are fac
tors such as location, talent, and
directorial experience which are
pretty good guideposts in forecast
ing the outcome of any show. In 
these departments, the current 
Scotch n Soda show appears 
Strong.
Popular Site
In Schenley HS auditorium,
Scotch n Soda has a very desir
able location. The current site is 
used by the Pittsburgh Savoyards, 
the Pittsburgh Symphony, and 
some 35 other outside organiza
tions. It has a reputation for ex
cellent accoustics and vision and 
is in many ways superior to the 
Carnegie Music Hall, a former site 
of the show.
The job of putting the script of 
*A Merry Chase on the stage 
has been left in the capable hands 
of Mark Lewis, a senior drama 
direction major., Lewis has done 
similar work in a professional ca
pacity with the Camden, Connecti
cut, Playhouse, Hayes Productions, 
and the Pittsburgh Childrens The
atre.
Arranged For Radio
Ken Rossignol, aiso a drama 
student, holds the jack-of-all 
trades job of technical advisor.
Rossignol was associated for some 
time with the oft-mentioned New 
York City Center of Music and 
Art as assistant to the stage de
signer. He has also worked with 
the Margaret Webster Stock Com
pany Company and Bill Greens 
Arena Theatre.
Handling the huge task of ar
ranging most of the 18 song and 
dance numbers in the show is 
John Zurosky. Before coming to 
CIT, Zurosky was an arranger for

Friday Night Features Music Of Walt Harper; 
Rege Cordic To Emcee Floor Show In Gym
Spring Carnival committee announced today that Shep Fields, of 
Rippling Rhythm fame, has been signed to play for the Spring Car
nival Saturday night formal on May 12. At the same time it was 
announced that the greatest Friday night program in recent years
has also been arranged. ?------------------------------------------------------
Tickets will go on sale in Skibo 
tomorrow at 11:30 on a first-come, 
first-served basis. Student ID 
cards will be required for each 
ticket purchased. The price is 
$4.75 per couple for both nights.
Fields is coming to Carnegie 
Tech following appearances at 
other colleges, as well as hotels 
and night clubs throughout the 
country. He has received recent 
rave notice as one of the finest 
dance bands in the country, and 
is steadily becoming more popu
lar with the college crowds.
Walt Harper Friday 
Featured with Fields will be vo
calists Thelma Gracen and Tom
my Lucas, The Rippeds, Carmel 
and her violin, and Bob Shapley 
and his accordion. The latter two 
have received high praise from 
critics, following appearances on 
both television and radio.
In a change from last year, Fri
day nights dance will be moved to 
the gym in order to facilitate the 
presentation of an hour-long floor 
show. Walt Harper, an old-time 
campus favorite, will play for 
dancing before and after the floor
Junior Class Officers Sponsor 
Senior Ball In Carnegie Hall
Warner To Deliver Baccalaureate Address;
Time Of Commencement Exercises Changed
Several important changes have been made in the schedule of 
graduation activities for seniors. The Senior Ball, originally sched
uled to be held on June 12, has been changed to June 13 at 9 p.m., 
immediately following Baccalaureate. The dance, being sponsored 
this year by the junior class offi-*
cers, will be held in the foyer of 
Carnegie Music Hall.
Baccalaureate services will be 
held, as previously announced, on 
June 13 at 8 p.m. in the audi
torium of the music hall. Presi
dent Warner will deliver the Bac
calaureate address.
No Commencement Address
Commencement will take place 
on June 14 at Syria Mosque. 
However, the starting time has 
been moved ahead from the orig
inally planned 8 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. 
No commencement address will be 
given this year, only the customary 
presidents address to the gradu
ates. The presidents reception 
will be held in Carnegie Union 
at 4:30 p.m. following commence
ment.
Seating Changed
Changes have also been made 
in the seating arrangements and 
in the procedure for presentation 
of diplomas this year. All the 
faculty are to be seated on the 
stage instead of in the auditorium 
proper, thus making additional 
room for the graduates and their 
guests. Another new feature will 
have the various department heads 
call off the names of the candidates 
for degrees from their depart 
ments
each college performed this task. 
The presentation to the gradu
ates will stil1 be made by the 
deans.

Editorials
Those Council Appointments
Only seven petitions have been received for the seven 
Student Council vacancies from Engineering and Science. 
Therefore, these men will be automatically installed; they 
will be appointed rather than elected. Where does the fault 
lie?
In this case, Student Council, and the elections chairman 
in particular, must take part of the responsibility. The notice 
concerning the forthcoming election was given to the Tartan 
for publication on Tuesday, March 24the petitions were 
due on the following Friday. This leaves very little time 
margin for those interested in running for Council. If a 
student happened to read the Tartan several days late he was 
just out of luck.
Why were there exactly seven candidates for the seven va
cancies? Because the Interfraternity Action Committee makes 
certain that men are running for each vacancy. In one sense this 
group does Council a service by saving it the embarrassment of 
having fewer candidates than vacancies, but the system the com
mittee uses is open to criticism.
In effect, each fraternity on campus is given a quota of 
Council members. Though there may be three or four men 
of the same fraternity well qualified and eager for Council 
duty, only one or two of these men, at most, can enter the 
electionunless they want to campaign on their own and 
run the risks of fraternity, and interfraternity, displeasure.
Now look at the sad state of the independents. Two years 
ago, under able leadership, independent candidates swept 
twelve of the sixteen vacancies on Council. Fraternities filled 
only two spots. Yet today there is no single male member 
of Council who is not a fraternity man. Perhaps these men 
are the best available for the job, but we have a feeling 
there are many independents who could serve Council equally 
well, or better, but for the lack.of an efficient vote-getting 
organization to put them in office.
There is, however, a much greater possibility for the lack of 
petitions. It may well be that there are not seven people on 
campus who are interested in joining Council. Council has be
come an unweildy organization where close to fifty percent of 
the members do little or nothing; the very size of the group 
makes it less efficient than an organization a third its size.
The proposal now before Councilto reduce the repre
sentation from 100 to 200 students per membershould be 
passed. This could be the first step toward a renovated and 
efficient Student Council.
The experience of other schools has shown that it is not 
necessary to have a great many people to do the job. For 
example, Pitt with a student body of close to twenty thousand 
has a council of only ten or twelve membersdoing the 
same work Carnegies does with thirty. Then why carry 
along the dead wood?
At the last Council meeting the opinion was voiced that 
a man is worth having on Council even if he makes only one 
suggestion a year. Couldnt such few-and-far-between con
tributions be handled just as effectively by the new sugges
tion system or through personal contacts, thus avoiding a 
water-logged Council? We think so.
But perhaps a large Council performs a valuable function by 
giving students training in the qualities of leadership. Whether 
Council trains any one for leadership is debatable, but even if true, 
ft seems a poor policy to subject the student body to inefficiencies 
and quorumless meetings so that some few may improve them
selves. An organization handling the sums of money that Coun
cil does should not be used as a training ground.
Lets hope there is a quorum present at the next meet
ing so that something can be done about these conditions.

CHANGE FOR THE BETTER
Letters To The Editor
Student Government 
Hits Lack of Interest
To the Students:
There exists on this campus a 
large segment of students who 
take great pleasure in criticizing 
campus organizations. It is evident 
that Student Council bears the 
brunt of these attacks, be they 
just or unjust. The constitution of 
this body gives every student the 
right to attend council meetings, 
so that he or she may express any 
criticisms or suggestions. How
ever, the long walk to the Car
negie Union (meeting place of 
Student Council) undoubtedly 
discourages those students who 
might even have founded and just 
complaints.
Council realizes that this method 
of democratic action works undue 
hardship on the complaining stu
dent. To alleviate this hardship, 
Student Council, with the help of 
the operations division, has plac
ed suggestion boxes in conven
ient and conspicuous locations 
about the campus. It was sincere
ly felt that by being provided with 
this direct means of communica
tion with Student Council, the 
students would respond enthu
siastically.
But lets take a look at the re
sults to date. Exactly two sugges
tions were received from the stu
dent body, both of which receiv
ed prompt attention. In addition, 
many students found the boxes 
convenient for the disposal of 
waste paper, cigarette ashes, ap
ple cores, and chewing gum.
The results would seem to in
dicate one of two situations: Eith
er an overwhelming majority of 
the students have no complaint 
with Council and are completely 
satisfied as to conditions existing 
on the campus; or these same stu
dents have exhibited utter apathy, 
indifference, complacency, and 
disregard for a sincere attempt to 
give them a means for expressing 
their views. Council feels the lat
ter situation to be the truer pic
ture. This is a serious accusation, 
but the evidence is conclusive.
Regardless of this state of af
fairs, Student Council will con
tinue to function in a manner 
which it feels is in the best inter
ests of the student body.
Leonard Hvizdos, 
Special Committee. 
Paul Stettler,
President,
Student Council.
Editor, the Tartan:
I am sure that your editorial 
concerning class organization in 
the April 17th issue was an invita
tion to some explanation of what 
is going on with respect to class 
organization. Evidently, you do not 
know.
When class organization was 
started about two years ago, it was 
general opinion that it would*take 
at least five years for the idea to 
catch hold and to have class or
ganization function as we would 
desire it. Thus, in a sense, class 
organization is still in its infancy 
and should not be expected to 
function perfectly at the present 
time.
True, we do have a lack of 
funds, of student participation, and 
lack of proper organization. With 
reference to the last item, I am 
referring to the whole general set
up, not how it is organized under 
the present set-up.
With reference to the first possi
bility you mentioned regarding 
worthiness of the class officers, I 
think you have overlooked the 
serious handicaps that these offic
ers have faced in performing their 
duties.
The classes are supposed to be 
self-sufficient financially. They 
started without funds, and were 
to raise such funds as would be 
needed by whatever ingenious 
methods as could be devised on 
campus. If these methods happen
ed to be unsuccessful, the classes 
either broke even or went into 
debt to Student Council. The lat
ter instance has been the case to 
date with the exception of one 
small event that did manage to 
break even.
If we had sufficient student par
ticipation in the class events where 
admission charges are necessary, 
class organization would be much 
further along than it is now. 
However, sufficient student par
ticipation had not been evidenced 
in the past, nor is it seen for the 
immediate future.
I realized this problem even bej fore going into office, and thereI fore decided upon a gradual ap| proach to obtaining an income for 
i the present year.
Before entering school last fall,
, every junior received a letter from 
' me in his permit to register stating 
i frankly what class organization 
1 was for, and what we would try to 
do to accomplish its purpose. 
ShorUy after classes began, Varie
ties of 52 was staged, free of 
i charge, to get the class together

At intervals the Tartan will 
publish comments of a Guest 
Writer, who will be a student or 
faculty member of CIT. This

Sacred Heart College, Sudbury, 
Ontario, and three years at Otta

If I were to write on whats 
right with Americans, I should 
fill this page and nothing would 
be accomplished other than to 
please the reader. But if I state 
a few or the unfavorable impres
sions I have received in viewing 
Americans it might bring some 
thoughtful students to some new 
considerations.
I am not interested in pleasing 
the reader.
Here in Amer
ica the large 
concern is with 
pleasure and 
comfort, and 
the public mind 
has lost the re
alization that 
all good things 
are not neces
sarily pleasur
able and that 
un pleasa n t 
things are oftentimes the most 
satisfying. This is no one indi
viduals fault, but it is due to the 
strong climates of opinion found 
in your country.
Americas climate of opinion 
is probably the most intensified in 
the world, even greater than that 
of Nazi Germany or Eire. Try 
wearing clothes outside the fash
ion, or speaking thoughts outside 
the current climate of thought. 
Everything Current
Everything in America must be 
current. It doesnt matter how 
good the efficiency of the article is, 
if it isnt in style, it is valueless.

terrific strain on your individual 
life) as the United States, nor does

for the first time. This was a suc
cessful event from the attendance 
standpoint, and at the time was 
^regarded successful in all its oth
er purposes. Then a minimum cost 
dance was planned from which 
only a small profit was expected. 
In the meantime the class cabinet 
had been formed composed of a 
member from every section in 
school. These thirty-odd cabinet 
members were given the job oi 
selling tickets to the dance. We 
had maximum publicity. We sold 
sixteen tickets by the eve of the 
dance. Obviously, it had to be call
ed off.
The class thus absorbed the 
debts from sending out letters, 
Varieties, and some of the costs 
of planning the dance. The failure 
of this dance after such careful 
planning, and the failure of other 
class functions has led class offic
ers to be reluctaht in undertaking 
future projects whereby the cost 
of projects has to be paid from ad
mission charges.
Then to climax events, the 
school announced plans for accel
eration in E&S. No successful plan 
was submitted to meet this prob
lem, and if carried through, ac
celeration would be the death of 
class organization. Now that plans 
for acceleration have been can
celled, class organization should 
be expected to carry on. My own 
class is to sponsor the Senior ball, 
which should become a tradition.
I have mentioned earlier my ob
jection to the class organization 
program in general. Although not 
completed in detail as yet, my 
proposal will include class dues, 
convention type elections, and 
complete independence for the 
classes. Only under these condi
tions will we be able to make class 
organization fully accomplish its 
purposes.
Yours truly,

Any decisive action by Student Council was again postponed due 
to lack of a quorum. Any action taken was deferred until it could 
be officially approved at the next meeting.
John Vassil, chairman of the plans and programs committee, pre
sented a proposal to cut down the^
time for preparation. The sched

It was announced that it might

A resolution was approved allow

such a rally. This motion was 
aimed to put Council on record as

We Arrive as Strangers is 
based on the universal theme that 
love and the ability to love gives 
one the strength to face life. The 
story centers around a group of 
people living in a small Montana 
town. Real and supernatural ele
ments alike are revealed in the

SPORTSCOPE
by Justin Davidson
The administration at Cafnegie has never failed to recog
nize the importance of a sports program on the college cam
pus. Even the controversial de-emphasis of football in 1939 
was instituted to strengthen rather than destroy sports at 
CIT. It was felt at the time that a better balance between 
varsiy and intramural sports at Carnegie, would not avoid 
the consequence of professionalism in sports, but also extend 
the real benefits of athletic participation to a wider range 
of students.
Now, 12 years later in retrospect, we can pay a real tribute 
to Dr. Doherty who originated this program. The intramural 
sports program has prospered in the last 12 years to the ad
vantage of more and more student participants each year. At 
the same time the records of the varsity teams in the past few 
years have proved Dr. Dohertys thesis that a school doesnt have 
to go professional to have winning varsity sports.
Perhaps the best indication of the success of Carnegies 
sports porgram is a comparison of its results with the pro
grams of schools who have continued to go big time. At 
Ohio State, which is rather frankly this way, their program 
has resulted only in the taint of professionalism on their 
teams and an insane desire to win for the sake of winning 
among the student body and the townsmen of Columbus. 
The real purpose of sportsto develop sound bodies and 
sound minds, to teach teamplay, discipline, and sportsman
shiphas been obscured.
The recent basketball scandals in New York have served 
to point out that the varsity athlete in this professionalist 
situation soon recognizes he is not playing for any of the 
avowed aims of sports and takes the realistic view that he 
will get all he can. While the moral turpitude of the athletes 
involved in such a case cannot be approved, the outraged 
cries of the people who are at the root of such situations 
cannot be pitied.
Room for Criticism
Although the long range sports program of the school 
deserves just commendation, the schools attention to day-today problems deserves criticism. At the present there are 
several instances which seem to justify this accusation. 
Wherever the fault lies, and in the last analysis the respon
sibility rests with the school, the soccer and softball fields 
on the Cut are neither suitable nor safe. The field itself is so 
worn with ruts that an infield ground ball is practically un
playable. The piles of dirt, which were supposedly to have 
been removed before Spring Carnival, are still there and 
hardly present a safety factor for play. The manhole covers 
on which several people have been hurt seriously still present 
a hazard although objections to them were raised as long 
as a year ago. When will the school take action?
This spring a contract was let to have the tennis courts by 
Margaret Morrison refinished with asphalt by tennis time. At 
the present the courts are still unfinished and the tennis team 
has been unduly hampered by lack of practice space. What sort 
of planning is it that plans only at the last moment or provides 
no alternatives if the plan is not carried out? When will the 
school take action?
The football team has never griped about its accomo
dations in the fieldhouse; Carnegie teams have used its facili
ties ever since it was first built. However, they should have 
some gripe when they have to kill nine-inch rats in the 
shower room, as Irv Shechter did the other day. A little 
attention and some rat squill could take care of this. When 
will 'the school take action?
Although the above represent problems needing the most 
immediate attention, there are others which also deserve 
consideration in the near future. The track in the Bowl 
could stand a coat of cinders and a grading. The football 
field needs attention to its surface and better drainage facili
ties. As long as the administration continues its lackadaisical 
approach to such problems, it will continue to hear the same 
criticism from this column: When will the school take action?
Those Downtown Write-Ups
Sundays favorable article in the Press concerning Tar
tan spring football practice marks another step in the ad
vancement of Pittsburgh sport writers attitude toward Car
negie Tech. Long regarded as the poor cousin in the Pitts
burgh sports triumvirateDuquesne had basketball, Pitt 
had football, but little Carnegie had nothingCarnegie is 
fim v beginning to be overwritten instead of underwritten.
Dr. Baker and his boys, however, are a little bit skepti
cal of sport writers prediction for next season. With breaks 
and a little luck, they realize they could have a very suc
cessful season. The Tartans have a seasoned backfield and an 
adequate first string line, but injuries of key men could wreck 
the whole season. For the time being, this column will be 
modest and predict only a 50-50 season or better for the 
Plaid. If the Bakermen can do better, theirs is the glory 
and the Tartan will be proud to put it down in black and 
white.
Gridders Rout Pitt JY 
13-0 in Spring Finale
Oberg And Dissen Star As Last
Half Rally Brings Second Victory
Carnegie Techs rebuilt football team came to life in the second 
half of a hard-fought scrimmage with the Pitt junior varsity last 
Tuesday to make it two straight over Len Casanovas second-stringers 
and keep their spring practice record intact.
Staff Meeting
There will be a meeting of 
the sports staff of the Car
negie Tartan, Friday even
ing, May 4, at 8:00 in the Tar
tan office at the Carnegie 
Union. This meeting includes 
all who wish to work on the 
sports staff and have not 
contacted the Tartan as yet. 
There is still need for one or 
two reporters so dont hesitate 
to drop up.
Line Strong ?
The first half was marked by 
hard play, careful offense, stiff 
defense, and cool quarterbacking. 
The most encouraging feature of 
the game, however, was the stellar 
60 minute performance turned in 
by the Tartan line, despite the ab
sence of Rusty Rusnak, first string 
guard, who was injured in an 
automobile accident last Satur
day. The Plaid forward wall took 
the best the big boys from Pitt 
could offer during the rugged first 
half, then went on to smother 
them as the game wore into its 
final minutes.
Team Victory
Best individual performance of 
the afternoon was turned in by 
Gil Dissen, sophomore fullback 
and linebacker. Dissen, used by 
Coach Eddie Baker primarily on 
defense, seemed to be everywhere 
at once, and was a strong factor in 
enabling the Carnegie squad to 
shut out the Panthers. Other out
standing players included Oberg, 
Fritz Wilson, Hans Lange, and 
John Luchok, but all in all it was 
a +eam victory, sparked by a de
sire to win and an overall spirit of 
aggressiveness.
Spring Practice Ends
The second Carnegie score came 
when Oberg again intercepted a 
Panther pass and was downed on 
the 45. Luchok and Schecter car
ried for a first down, and Leaman 
threw a pass to Wilson whicfl was 
ruled complete on the 23 because 
of interference Luchok made it a 
first down on the 13. Schecter 
carried to the Pitt 6, and dberg 
got the first-and-goal on the one. 
Leaman gave the ball to Oberg 
again, and the big fullback 
rammed over. Dissen kicked the 
point and the score became 13-0.
The team ended its 1951 spring 
practice session last Friday, with 
a close, hara-fought and very in
teresting intersquad scrimmage, 
which resulted in 15-14 score. The 
battle was highly representative 
of the competitive spirit between 
the first and second teams which 
has prevailed during the entire 
spring session.
Annual Banquet, 
Election Held By 
WAA Members
Thirty-nine women were hon
ored at the annual Womens Ath
letic Association Award banquet 
held yesterday evening, April 30,

was given to Dee Douglas and 
Enid Orr, seniors; Emma Elwell, 
junior, and Beatrice Cohen, Joan 
Cummerton, and Clementine Wil
liams, sophomores. This is the 
first time in the history of WAA 
that a blazer has been won by 
sophomores. Carnegie Cs re

were awarded to Nancy Callaway, 
Jo Ann Carman, Theresa Fusca, 
Elva Lee Moore, Helen Halkas, 
and Dee Walker.
Twenty-seven girls received 
their class numerals, which re
quire a minimum of 30 points.
The newly elected officers and 
board members were installed at 
the banquet. Bea Cohen will head

entine Williams as vice-president; 
Gretchen Arnold, recording sec
retary; Nancy Haney, awards sec
retary, and Joan Cummerton, 
treasurer. Regular board mem
bers include Emma Elwell, Helen 
Halkas, Joan Cropp, Marilyn Protas, Patricia Miller, Rita OHara,

Tartan Golfers Edge 
Dukes for First Win
By Cal Biesecker
The Carnegie Golf Team got off to a good start toward another 
successful season by squeezing out a victory over Duquesne on Friday, 
April 27. Led by their captain, Richard Johnson, the linksmen hung 
on gamely to defeat the Dukes by a 9% to 8-^ count.
Low scorer for the day was' 
Johnson who had a sparkling 75 
over the Pittsburgh" Field Club 
course. The real hero of the day, 
however, was the Tartans Walter 
Kuehn who won the final and de
ciding match of the day by a 2 to 1 
score and thus gave Carnegie the 
victory.
Geneva Next
This years team faces a seven 
match schedule which will be con
cluded with a home and home ser
ies with Grove City. Other foes in 
order of their appearance will be 
Geneva, Westminster, Gettysburg, 
and Pitt. The Tartans will be out 
for revenge when they meet West
minster and Pitt, for these two op
ponents gave the Tech golfers 
their only two defeats last season.
The squad which will be out to 
better last years record of five 
wins and two losses is mostly a 
veteran outfit. Its members in or
der of their position on the team 
are: Johnson, Roy Ryabik, EdVour I.D. CARD Means

regular season for Ryabik and 
Meyers, the third for Denburg and 
Holland, and the fourth for John

admission charge for those hardy 
souls who want to follow the boys 
around the 18-hole layout. The 
19th hole is not included with 
the free admission.
The Tartans have two engage
ments scheduled for this week. 
This afternoon the Plaid will host 
the Geneva Covies at the Pitts

Tartans Drop Tennis 
Opener to Duquesne
Monstream And Saibel Carry
Plaid Burden In Losing Cause
The Carnegie Tech tennis team opened its season Friday afternoon 
at the Arsenal Courts with a heartbreaking 5-4 defeat at the hands of 
the Bluffites from Duquesne. With a bit more pre-season practice the 
Tartan racqueteers might have eked out a win as they lost by the 
margin of only one match. ?----------------------------------------------
There was a bright spot in the 
Plaid loss, however, as Manlon 
Saibel, newcomer to the team, 
turned in a 6-4, 6-3 win in his 
singles match and then teamed 
with Don Duncklee to defeat Cola 
and Hayes of Duquesne in dou
bles.
Montstream Stars
The putstanding performance of 
the day was turned in by Captain 
John Montstream, who with Bob 
Weiderhorn is the only returning 
lettermen from last years team. 
Montstream, down 1-5 in the third 
set after splitting the first two 
with Conlan of the Dukes, won 
i six straight games to take the set, 
7-5, and the match 2-1.
Weiderhorn, playing in the num
ber one singles spot, turned in a 
rather disappointing performance 
as he lost a love match to Wynn 
of the Hilltoppers. Weiderhorn 
and Montstream teaming against
Wyitn and Conlan managed to win 
the first set of their match 6-3, but 
went down in the next two, 3-6 
and 4-6.
In the longest and what may 
have been the deciding match, 
George Berringer of the Tartans 
was nipped in a long drawn out 
match, 11-13, 6-3, 4-6. Berringer, 
playing in the number six spot, 
along with Bob Duffus, number 
five, and Don Duncklee, number 
three, showed quite a bit of prom
ise, although all three lost their 
matches.
Tech Takes Doubles
In the final doubles match, Carl 
Finder and Larry Cederstrom of 
Carnegie teamed to defeat Maish 
and Ponta to make the final score 
5-4.
The team will face quite a bit 
of action this week as they travel 
to Westminster Wednesday.

the big gun in the Carnegie attack 
as he took firsts in the 120 yard 
high hurdles, the 220 yard low 
hurdles, and the high jump. McKibben and Luchok also contrib
uted to the Carnegie cause by add
ing .two firsts apiece.
Strong In Track
The Skibos, as usual, proved 
strong in the track events but fell 
down in the field events. Grove 
City was able to establish only 
one first on the track, that being 
Hettishs victory in the 880 yard 
run.
In the mile run Bob Carmen 
finished ahead of team-mate Tom 
Douglas to capture the event in 
4:41.2. Carmen and Cooper finish
ed hand-in-hand in the two mile 
run followed by Bill Bloom to 
sweep this event. The time was 
11:18.4.
The Plaid proved invincible in 
the dashes as Price, Luchok, and 
McKibben captured top honors in 
the 400, the 100, and the 220 yard 
dash respectively. The Grovers 
managed to place only one man in

events, that honor going to Ball

" Hammann Stars
Connie Hammann took the

weaker spots. Paul Cuffari of 
Grove City, however, took two 
firsts in the weight division. His 
46 foot, 2 inch toss was tops in 
the shot-put and his 120 foot, 2 
inch discus throw proved to be 
the best of the afternoon. Taylor 
of Tech, however, showed promise 
as he placed in both events.
Javelin Surprise 
Bateman and Blumfeldt of Tech 
teamed together to easily take the 
pole vault honors at 10 feet, 6 
inches. Hammans 5 foot, 9^ inch 
jump was best in the high jump 
and Luchok added his second first 
of the day by leaping 21 feet, 2 
inches in the broad jump. Biggest 
surprise of the day, however, was 
when McKibben threw the javelin 
123 feet to walk off with top hon
ors for Tech.
Coach Halferty attributed the 
teams success to the depth and 
strength of his reserves. The 
number 2 and number 3 men came 
through much better than they 
did against Case, he explained.

Carnegie Debating Society, pre
sided, and Dean Dickinson and 
Professor Wright welcomed the 
guests to CIT.
Honor Oswant
It took the boys from Howard 
some time to realize that they ac
tually had won the closely con
tested tournament. They finally 
came forward to the accompani
ment of the pipers to receive the 
trophy.
Another award, this one not 
scheduled on the tournament pro
gram, was made by Joel Readio 
on behalf of the Tartan debaters. 
He presented Mr. Richard C. Os

a set of cuff links for the great 
amount of work he had done to 
make Carnegie Techs first fullscale tournament a success.
The winning team, coached by

up of Rufus Breland, James Lee, 
Matthew Temple, and James Sex
ton, Jr.

Started in New Jersey 
Shep Fields has met with phe
nomenal success since he first or
ganized his band twelve years 
ago. He started by playing en
gagements along the New Jersey 
roadside circuit, but before long 
his popularity earned him offers 
fcom all over the country. He 
booked into the Palmer House for 
I a two-week trial and set the 
Windy City press on its ear with 
a new style of music called Ripp
ling Rhythm. The date lasted 
forty weeksan all-time run at 
the very popular Palmer House.
Nine months jammed with pub
licity and air time served Shep 
well. He left Chicago with con
tracts booking him a year in ad
vance. In the following years 
Fields gained more than his share 
of popularity. His band has been 
featured at every leading hotel, 
theatre, ballroom and location in
the nation. Recordings made by 
his orchestra number in the hun
dreds and. have sold millions of 
copies.
New Music
In 1943 he tired of Rippling 
Rhythm and started a new idea 
in popular music by combining 
nine saxophones and five rhythm 
instruments for what he called 
New Music. The idea was  
great hit for three years, but the 
public clamored for the return of 
Rippling Rhythm.
In 1946, Fields temporarily gave 
up his band to operate one of the 
most famous music showcases in 
the worldGlen Island Casino. 
However, once again his public 
demanded th return of the very 
popular Rippling Rhythm style.
Four Networks 
Fields holds the unique record 
of having played on all four ma
jor radio networks. He has had 
commercial shows on CBS, NBC, 
ABC, and the Mutual network. 
He has also appeared twice re
cently on TVs Cavalcade of Bands.
His most recent recordings have 
been made for MGM, but he has 
previously cut records for RCA 
Victor, Bluebird, and Musicraft,

Students of the Carnegie Insti9We Need Support!
As the last Social affair on the evening school calendar 
draws near, we wonder if it will end in a dismal financial 
flop.
Of course a financial failure does not necessarily mean 
that an affair is a complete failure, for Council has held many 
affairs that have ended in the red, but nevertheless the stu
dents attending them have had a grand time. The adverse 
financial results make it most difficult for Evening Student 
Council to interest people in planning and helping with 
these affairs.
We realize that one great draw-back is the increased cost of 
staging these affairs and the consequent rise in the price of ad
mission. A current gripe is that the admission price is too high 
for a school affair. We have always regarded that criticism as 
unwarrented, for we know that this price could be lowered if 
only the attendance were great, for only by volume can you 
decrease unit price.
The answer, we feel, lies in greater attendance to these 
affairs so Council can be assured of a large turn-out and thus 
decrease the admission price.
Phi Gamma Pi 
Pledg es Give 
Sisters Tea
At a tea held at the Carnegie 
Union on Sunday, April 22, the 
new pledges of Phi Gamma Pi 
honored the big sisters of the so
rority. Mrs. Goodfellow, English 
instructress, was guest speaker 
for the afternoon.
The entertainment program was 
comprised of a song and dance 
by two pledges. Lydia Liston 
sang Smiling Through by Arth
ur A. Penn and Rea Sylvia Cicin 
ballet danced to the music of 
The Tale of the Vienna Woods.
A delightful time was enjoyed 
by everyone present and the tea 
was indeed successful.
On May 6, thirteen new pledges 
will be initiated into Phi Gamma 
Pi Sorority. Initiation will take 
place at Carnegie Union.

Dean Dickinson Is 
Popular Toastmaster
Now that the Thirty-Sixth An
nual Banquet of the Evening Col
lege of Engineering and Science 
is over, we are safe in saying that 
it was a grand affair and worthy 
of taking its place among the oth
er well remembered banquets 
that have been held by the even
ing school engineers.
Toastmaster Dean Dickinson 
proved popular with the evening 
group and their friends. After 
having apologized for his inex
perience in such tasks Dean Dick
inson went ahead and handled 
his job with great fiinesse.
Dr. Hutcheson, guest speaker at 
the banquet, gave a fine talk on 
the Place of Research in the 
Electrical Industry. The talk 
was not only enlightening but was 
thought inspiring.
The floor show was sparked by 
a fine roller-skating act that en
livened the affair with audience 
participation.
Each person at the banquet re
ceived a bag-full of souvenirs and 
favors. As in former years the 
items in the bags were supplied 
by leading industrial manufactur
ers and distributors in the coun
try.
The climax of the affair was 
the awarding of the many worthy 
door prizes. The most coveted 
prize was a Janitrol Conversion 
burner that retails for approxi
mately $150.00.

More BOUNCE To The Ounce
Americans Superficial, Lack Understanding
[Continued from page 2] 
any other country have less of a 
real sense of time than does the 
United States.
Even in relaxation the tempo is 
extraordinary. You relax-in hustle 
and bustle, with the speed of a jet 
plane and the energy of a wres
tling tomcat.
Where are you going and what 
are you doing? You dont really 
know nine times out of ten. One 
doesnt think about what he is do
ing, as long as he is doing some
thing. Learn to relax. Why be in 
a rush all of the time? Youll get 
where youre going whether you 
rush or not, and if you dont rush 
you will personally be far better 
off.
Dont Give Credit
Another weak point in American 
national character is the general 
lack of giving credit where credit 
is due, if it is due to some one who
is not a United States citizen. If 
something is American it is best. 
Bigger and better is synonymous 
with anything, if it be Amer
ican. But in reality this is not al
ways so.
For example, when Americans 
visit Canada, they come to take 
pictures and pick up travel pam
phlets, so they can show that they 
are superior to their neighbors 
who havent been to Canada. They 
do not come to learn something 
from these people who are slightly 
different from themselves. How 
could they, when they know it 
all and have everything which is 
bigger and betterexcept may
be a knowledge of how to enjoy 
life.
Lack of Understanding
Your superficiality and lack of 
understanding is true not only of 
Canada but of other countries as
well. Your leaders when they 
travel abroad, for it is the leading 
citizens who do so, see in Euro
pean nations exactly what the or
dinary American sees in Canada 
snapshots and travel pamphlets. 
No effort is made to study and 
understand the differences found 
in these European nations. You 
are content to see merely the sur
face. Yes, Americans are fast be
coming a nation of surface skim
mers with basic honesty and indi
viduality giving way to the pre
vailing climate of opinion.
