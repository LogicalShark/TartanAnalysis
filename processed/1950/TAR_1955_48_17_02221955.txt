99SnS Celebrates 50th 
With Adults Only
Fifty years ago, in 1905, the first musical comedy was produced at 
Tech. To celebrate this important anniversary, the Scotch n Soda 
Club has spent special energies in the preparation of this years pro
duction, which acordipg to people who have had the opportunity of
Adults Only is the title of the* 
sparkling musical comedy to cele
brate the event, and as usual it 
will be an all-campus production, 
with the participation of students 
from the different departments at 
school.
Bob Smith and Ron Friedman, 
from the department of architec
ture, have contributed the book 
for the show. Ron Friedman is an 
old hand in this type of job and 
audiences of past productions of 
Scotch n Soda will remember his 
name. Bob Smith, a newcomer to 
the field, was the author of the 
winning script for the show. The 
author of the music is Bill Henry, 
who has created tunes which will 
be remembered along with the old 
favorites of past Scotch n Soda 
productions.
The choreography will be han
dled by Teena Stern and Barb 
Hall who will pool their previous 
Scotch n Soda experience to once 
again train a group of novices and 
mold them ihto a dancing group of 
professional calibre. Bob Livings
ton, a senior in the drama depart
ment who has done a great deal of 
professional work, will direct the 
show. Settings for the show will 
be executed by Barry Buchter who 
has just completed the sets for the 
current production in the drama 
department. Costumes for the 
show will be designed by Joan 
Newman and Michael Pollock,
Kestners Art 
In Erie Exhibit
Jack Kestner, a sophomore in 
the department of painting and 
design, has had an exhibition of 
his work put on display in the art 
gallery of the Erie Public Library.
The show includes various kinds 
of paintings and a number of 
drawings. They range from cre
ative realism to semi-abstraction 
in landscape, still life, composi
tion, figure, and portrait studies.
Jack had previously received 
prizes in an exhibition of the Fed
eration of Erie Artists and the Art 
Clubs Black and White Show, and 
he placed second in the interpre
tation of the Carnival of Ani
mals sponsored by the Erie Phil
harmonic Society.
Also interested in music and 
drama, Jack had a television show 
with a friend when he was in high 
School in Erie. For the past four 
summers, he has been the director 
Of arts and crafts at the YMCA 
summer camp. .Here at Tech, he 
is student director of the choir.
. Fellotvship
The Methodist Wesley Fel
lowship is sponsoring a so
cial and swimming party on 
February 25 at the Carnegie 
Tech pool. Following the 
swimming from 8:00 to 10 
there will be recreation 
(games, dancing, etc.) and 
refreshments will be served 
at the Black Cat lounge. It 
is hoped that all Tech Meth
odists will come to this af
fair and bring their friends.
Two Tech Girls 
Win In National 
Fashion Contest
Carnegie Tech is proud to boast 
of two winners in the Mademoiselle 
College Board Contest. They were 
Rachel Katzin of the junior P & D 
department and Marjorie Huling, 
a senior clothing and textile ma
jor. These girls are two of the 
lucky 500 who can continue to 
compete in the contest.
Of the five hundred, 20 girls 
will be chosen on May 1 to go to 
New York for the month of June 
to edit and publish, the college is
sue for August of Mademoiselle.
In order to be one of the five 
hundred, the girls were chosen on 
the basis of their general crit
icism of last years college issue 
and criticism of one specific field 
such as fashion, design art or 
advertising.
Marjorie Huling did a criticism 
on the fashions in the August is
sue and then in January submit
ted an essay on the problems of 
a college student and a character
ization on the campus wheels.
Rachel Katzin won on her crit
icisms of the art and the design 
work of the college issue and then 
entered in January a two page 
layout of dormitory fashions 
which she designed. In addition 
to this she entered a cartoon on 
Tech girls.
The girls can also enter extra 
material such as a description of 
an interesting course they are tak
ing or describe some activity on 
, campus.
Both girls are now working on 
their February assignments and 
other future features.
Kiltie Band Adds 
International Note
The Kiltie Band Symphony 
Concert held on Friday, February 
18, at Carnegie Music Hall, fea
tured La Fiesta Mexicana, writ
ten in 1949 by H. Owen Reed, and 
never heard before by a Pitts
burgh audience.
The Kiltie Band rendition of 
the rarely played piece was re
corded with the rest of the con
cert and presented to the Mexican 
Secretary of Public Education 
who will turn it over to the 
UNESCO Committee set up in 
Mexico for the exchange and dis
semination of foreign culture. The 
Mexican Consul in Pittsburgh re
ceived the recording from the 
Dean of Fine Arts, Norman L. 
Rice, at intermission ceremonies.
The Kiltie Band is proud to 
participate in this gesture of in
ternational good will, Dean Rice 
said. The Mexican source of the 
music which we present here is 
an indication of our increasing 
respect for our fellow North 
Americans, their cultural re
sources, and their vigorous na
tional spirit.
An Irish tone poem, Mannin 
Veen by Hadyn Wood and Wag
ners Overture To Tannhouser 
added more international flavor to 
the concert. John Phillip Sousas 
centennial anniversary was also 
celebrated tbe night of the con
cert with the playing of four 
Sousa marches.
C Book
Because of the many 
changes in campus addresses 
brought about by the move 
into Donner Hall, A Phi O has 
had a C Book supplement 
printed, containing the names, 
room numbers, and telephone 
numbers of the residents of 
Donner Hall. This supplement 
can now be obtained at the 
Book Store simply by asking 
for it, first come, first served. 
Get yours, now.
Tech Physics Dept. 
Receives Grant 
For Nuclear Study
The National Science Founda
tion has granted Carnegie Tech 
$20,600 to further current studies 
with the new nuclear science tool, 
the positron.
The positron, a positively charg
ed electron, is used as a probe to 
investigate the internal structure 
of matter. When the positive elec
tron meets its negative sister in 
a solid substance, the result is an
nihilation of both. All the mass is 
transformed into energy repre
sented by two gamma rays. The 
rays travel in opposite directions.
Research in the physics depart
ment under Professor Sergio De 
Benedetti is primarily concerned 
with the angle between these rays. 
In various metals, Dr. De Bene
detti says, the rays do not come 
off in exactly opposite directions 
and the difference of angle varies 
with the metal. There is a cor
relation between properties of the 
metals and thg angles of opposi
tion. We Lope a study of the ray 
angles will reveal something 
about the motion of electrons in 
solid materials.
Another method of studying the 
motion of electrons in solids is 
through measurement of the positrons-shoi't life duration in a sub
stance. This is now possible be
cause of recent timing techniques 
developed here which can check 
time down to a billionth of a sec
ond. These timing methods en
abled Dr. De Benedetti and other 
Tech scientists to discover that 
the positrons life span differed 
minutely in different metals.
Now they hope to learn why 
this difference exists and how it 
is related to the motion of elec
trons in a solid.
Foreign Club 
Elects Officers
The International Club of Car
negie Tech held elections last 
Thursday, February 17, at 8:00 
p.m. in the Cainegie Union. Mr. 
Walter Timbe, visiting research 
assistant in the metallurgy depart
ment from Berlin, Germany, was 
elected the new president.
Mr. Z. M. Alvi, graduate physics 
student from Pakistan, was elect
ed vice-president. Mr. Michael 
Spiro from Israel is the new secretary-treasurer. The new social 
chairman is Mr. Carl Semak.
The International Club is plan
ning on meeting every second 
Thursday to foster relations among 
visiting foreign students. Any in
terested students are invited to 
attend.
BARRACKSThe FPHA barracks, long the eyesore of the Car
negie Tech campus, are finally in the process of being torn down. 
Work has been stopped temporarily due to the recent bad weather.
Kansas City U. Joins 
Carnegie In 3-2 Plan
The University of Kansas City and Carnegie Tech will cooperate 
in a five year educational program leading to both liberal arts and 
engineering or science degrees.
Announcement of the cooperative program, known as the 3-2
----------------------------------------------------?plan, was made jointly today by
President Earl J. McGrath of theFraternity Sing 
And Swing Set
Carnegie Techs 12 fraternities 
and seven sororities will compete 
in the annual Greek Sing festival 
to be held Friday, March 4, at 
8:00 p.m. in the Carnegie Music 
Hall. The groups have been 
practicing for months and should 
provide excellent entertainment 
well worth the attendance of every 
Tech student. There is no ad
mission charge. .
Greek Swing will be held the 
following night, March 5, at the 
Syria Mosque from 9 to 1. This 
is the last dance of the year spon
sored by CFP and Pan Hell. Music 
will be provided by Baron Elliot 
and his orchestra. During internmission at the dance, at approxi
mately 11 p.m., the trophies will 
be awarded to the top singing 
groups. The scholarship cups will 
also be presented at this time. The 
judging of the singing is being 
done by a committee of six judges 
whose names will be announced 
later.
Gerald Lessmann and Molly 
Rudy are serving as co-chairmen 
for the. events, and Bill Taylor. 
Judy Storch, Becky Hughes, Mike 
Pollock, and Barbara Schultz are 
among those on the decorations 
committee for the dance. The con
cessions for Greek Swing will be 
taken care of by the Inter-Fra
ternity council.
Four Frosh Girls 
Elected To Serve 
On Dorm Council
Four freshmen have been elect
ed to represent their class on 
Womens Dormitory Council. They 
will have an opportunity to hear 
and discuss cases so that they may 
learn how the council operates, but 
they will have no voting privilege. 
The girls who were elected are 
Barbara Shannon, from Tower A, 
Delores Chidester from Tower B; 
Sally Day from Tower C; and 
Carolou Fidder from Tower D.
Womens and Mens Dormitory 
Councils had a joint meeting on 
Monday, February 14 to discuss 
further combined parties for both 
dormitories. Tentative plans were 
made for a dance to be held in 
the lobby of Donner Hall after 
open house. The date for this 
dance has not been established. 
Plans were also discussed for hav
ing movies- and refreshments in 
More wood Gardens for the com
bined group.
Next week each tower in Morewood Gardens will hold an elec
tion sponsored by Womens Dor
mitory Council to elect senior girls 
to run for Thistle Queeo.
University of Kansas City and 
Carnegie President, J. C. Warner. 
The program will go into effect 
in September 1955.
In the plan, students will take 
three years of liberal arts with a 
major in science at the University 
of Kansas City and then transfer 
to Carnegie Tech for two years of 
engineering or science. At the end 
of five years, they will receive 
bachelor of arts degrees from 
Kansas City and bachelor of sci
ence dfegrees from Tech.
Study Science
Transfer 3-2 students from 
Kansas City will be able to study 
one of the three pure science curriculums: chemistry, physics, or 
mathematics, or may choose one of 
the five engineering departments: 
civil, electrical, mechanical, chem
ical or metallurgical. They may 
also enter the department of in
dustrial management.
The 3-2 plan, according to Car
negie officials, allows the student 
a broad liberal arts foundation be
fore he undertakes a technical pro
gram. It also gives the undecided 
student some college experience 
which helps him decide whether 
he really wants to study engineer
ing or science.
Presidents Speak
Because of these advantages,* 
Carnegies President Warner said, 
we have invited selected liberal 
arts colleges to join with us and 
we are indeed happy to welcome 
into the 3-2 plan so fine an insti
tution as the University of Kansas 
City.
In Kansas City, President Mc
Grath said, The University of 
Kansas City is honored to be as
sociated with the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology in this 3-2 
program for the education of en
gineers. There is a serious short
age of engineers in the United 
States today, and the University 
feels, therefore, that it is provid
ing a Valuable and much needed 
service in making this new pro
gram available to high school 
graduates in this area. The Car
negie Institute of Technology has 
an international reputation in the 
field of engineering. Students who 
enroll in this program will, there
fore, receive excellent instruction 
in the basic sciences and the other 
disciplines in the University of 
Kansas City and in engineering at 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Senior Pictures
This is the last reminder for 
seniors to have their pictures 
for the Thistle taken by Gimbels by February 28. An ac
tivities card should be filled 
out at the time the picture is 
taken.

A New Idea In Financial Aid Is 
Grants To Student and School
There is now available to entering freshmen at Carnegie Tech 
a new type of scholarship which supports students with promise 
and additionally aids the school.
Alfred P. Sloan, former president of General Motors Corpora
tion and currently its chairman of+------- -------------------------------------------
the board, two years ago estab
lished the Sloan Foundation which 
has for its purpose research and 
experiment in education. It was 
revealed by the men who headed 
this program that college students 
pay little more than half the 
amount that is necessary to fi
nance their education. In other 
words, here at Carnegie Tech the 
rate of tuition which is about $700 
is in effect only half of the $1200- 
1400 necessary for each student.
Schools must depend upon grants, 
gifts, and endowments to make up 
the difference.
A New Principle
In order to encourage leaders 
for industry and at the same time 
pay the school for expenses not 
covered by tuition, the Sloan 
Foundation established a new 
scholarship principle whereby a 
student receives a scholarship and 
the school in which he is enrolled 
receives a supplementary sum. In 
this way colleges and universities 
are being encouraged to continue 
and increase their scholarship pro
grams. There are three Alfred P.
Sloan Scholarships available to 
entering freshmen at Tech.
Carnegie Tech, Cornell Univer
sity, California Institute of Tech
nology and Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology were the four 
schools included in the first appli
cation of this principle. The plan 
now extends to eleven schools.
Union Carbide, Lockheed Air
craft, General Motors, and Robert - 
shaw have also set up scholarship 
funds which function according to 
the findings of the Sloapi Founda
tion and are available to Tech 
students. There is indication that 
other groups will follow.
Engineer Cadets 
Plan Field Trip 
To NIKE Base
The Carnegie Tech chapter of 
the Society of American Military 
Engineers has planned a field trip 
to one of the eight Nike installa
tions surrounding Pittsburgh.
The trip, open to all SAME 
members and all sophomore cadets, 
is scheduled for Thursday, Febru
ary 24. Point of departure is the 
supply room at 1:00 p.m. The tour 
wTill last about four hours; those 
attending should be back on cam
pus about 5:00. Transportation 
will be provided by the military 
department. No uniforms are re
quired.
Nike, a super-sonic anti-air
craft projectile developed after 
eight years of research, is one of 
the basic heavy defensive weapons 
of the army. Every major city is 
now, or will be, encircled by Nike 
installations. A greater under
standing of the operations of this 
new weapon will, the military de
partment feels, be of invaluable 
aid to corps of engineer cadets.
YMHA & YWHA 
Sponsor Drama 
Education Classes
The YM & WHA Isaac Seder 
Educational Center is offering a 
course, unique in America, on 
T h e Enjoyment o f Current 
Theatre. The lectures are focused 
on theatrical productions being 
offered in Pittsburgh this spring.
Professor Astere E. Claeyssens, 
faculty member of Carnegie In
stitute of Technology will conduct 
the course. He is well known in 
local circles as a lecturer, writer 
and actor.
Starting with the only pre
requisite for the course, a lively 
interest in the legitimate theatre, 
discussions will center about play 
scripts, their influence upon con
temporary. theatre and thought, 
and the interpretations of the 
play by director, actors and set 
designer. From time to time dur
ing the twelve week course, 
special lectures and demonstra
tions will be given by professional 
theatre people of local and na
tional prominence.
Theatrical productions which 
will be given this year at the 
Nixon, Pittsburgh Playhouse, Car
negie Tech drama school and other 
playhouses will be attended and 
discussed.
The class begins Wednesday 
evening, February 23, and will 
continue to meet weekly for 
twelve sessions from 7:30 to 9:00 
p.m. Registration, which is open 
to everyone, is now available 
through the Educational Center of 
the Y, MAyflower 1-6500.

THE MAIL BAG
If the spirit should ever move you to write me a letterand 
its always a pleasure to hear from youtake pen and paper and 
address me c/o Philip Morris, 100 Park Ave., New York 17, N. Y. 
Or if you dont have any paper, snap open your Snap-Open 
pack of Philip Morris, remove the fine vintage cigarettes, turn 
the neat brown wrapper inside out and use it for stationery. 
The regular size Philip Morris pack is perfect for short notes. 
For longer letters use the king size pack. For chain letters and 
petitions, glue several packs together.
This weeks column is devoted to a few of the many interest
ing letters that have been coming in:
SIR:
Maybe you can help me. I came up to college eight years ago. 
On my very first day I got into a bridge game at the Students 
Union. I am still in the same bridge game. I have never gone to 
a class, cracked a book, or paid any tuition. All I do is play bridge.
To explain my long absence and keep the money coming from 
home, I told a harmless little lie. I said I was in medical school. 
This made Dad (my father) very proud. It also enabled me to 
keep playing bridge. We were both terribly happy.
But all good things must come to an end. Mine ended last 
week when I was home for spring vacation. I arrived to find that 
Sister (my sister) was in the hospital with an ingrown spleen. 
Dr. Norbert Sigafoos, the eminent ingrown spleen surgeon, was 
scheduled to operate, but unfortunately he was run over by a 
hot-food cart on the way to the scrubbing room.
Oh, never mind, chuckled Dad (my father). Harlow (me) 
will fix Sister (my sister).
Well sir, what could I do? If I told the truth I would make a 
laughingstock out of Dad (my father) who had been bragging 
about me all over town. Also I would get yanked out of school 
which would be a dirty shame just when I am getting to under
stand the weak club bid.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it out. I got Sister 
(my sister) apart all right, but I must confess myself com
pletely at a loss as to how to put her back together agaiij. Can 
you suggest anything? Theyre getting pretty surly around here.
Harlow Protein
Dear Harlow,
Indeed I do have a solution for youthe solution that has never 
failed me whenever things close in: Light up a Philip Morris! 
Knots untie a9 you puff that rich vintage tobacco. Shade becomes 
light as you taste that mild fragrant flavor . . . And as you watch 
the pure white smoke drift lazily upward, you will know that 
nothing is as bad as it seems, that it is always darkest before the 
dawn, and that the man worthwhile is the man who can smile!
SIR:
Do you think a girl should kiss a fellow on their first date?
Blanche Carbohydrate
Dear Blanche,
Not unless he is her escort.
SIR:
Here is a rather amusing coincidence that may amuse your 
readers.
Just oif the campus where I go to school there is a lake called 
Lake Widgiwagan where students from time immemorial have 
gone fishing. Thirty years ago when my father was an under
graduate here he went fishing one day at Widgiwagan and 
dropped his Deke pin into the water. Though he dived for it for 
many weeks, he never recovered it.
Just yesterdaythirty years later, mind youI went fishing 
at Widgiwagan. I caught a four pound bass. When I got the fish 
home and opened it up, what do you think I found inside of it?
You guessed it! Two tickets to the Dempsey-Firpo fight.
Fleance Fat
Dear Fleance,
It certainly is a small world.

Scandinavian Art 
Now On Exhibit 
At Carnegie Inst.
Many hands and minds have 
shaped the distinguished collec
tions of Danish, Finnish, Norwe
gian and Swedish articles in De
sign in Scandinavia. This exhibit 
is now on view at the Department 
of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute 
and will remain in Pittsburgh 
through March 14.
Tremendous in scope, this exhi
bition presents the full range of 
Scandinavian activity in contem
porary arts and decoration, and 
reflects earlier accomplishments.
So thorough is the integration of 
the artist-designer with the mass 
productive facilities of modern 
Scandinavia that no double stand
ard is in evidence. There are no 
assertions, of superiority attached 
to the handmade pieces nor do the 
mass-produced articles carry any 
indication of expedience in design 
and workmanship, the kind of 
damaging short cuts that mar com
petitive productions in many coun
tries. Design in Scandinavia 
makes no unnecessary parade of 
quaint, old world habits and at
titudes, but gererously presents to 
the American audience Scandina
vian solutions to the problem of 
achieving beauty in everyday sur
roundings.
Varied Exhibits
To be found in the exhibition is 
the work of a Norwegian farmer, 
living far to the north, who carves 
in bone and wood during the dark 
winter hours, while a few feet 
away may be seen highly refined 
stainless steel flatware produced 
by the collective efforts of hun
dreds of specialists working in *a 
great industrial plant in Sweden. 
In another gallery the visitor may 
come upon a stoneware vase by 
the world famous Danish artist, 
Salto, or a silver bowl by Baron 
Erik Fleming, Court Silversmith 
to the King of Sweden.
Reading
During the second semester, 
the bureau of measurement 
and guidance will offer the 
Reading Improvement Course 
at two different times. The 
groups will meet one period a 
week for the remainder of the 
semester and are open to any 
interested student. The two 
times available are:
9:30 Tuesday (beginning 
February 22) in AH 335G.
1:30 Friday (beginning Feb
ruary 25) in AH 336B.
Chesterfield Contest
Whose smile is this? You can 
win a package of Chesterfields if 
you can identify the smile when 
Edward Feigenbaum, the Chester
field representative on campus, 
calls on you. If you know the 
answer and you have your own 
pack of Chesterfields, you will i 
receive two free packs. Calls will 
be made at randojp throughout the 
week. The person in the picture 
was seen in a recent drama de
partment production.

Editorial
Carnegie Tech 
Finances
2.
The recent announcement by General 
Motors Corporation that they are doubling 
their financial assistance to private educa
tional institutions by establishing scholar
ships that not only pay the students tuition 
but also reimburse the school an equal 
amount to be used for general operations of 
the institution is one that is prevalent in in
dustry today. During the past several years 
Union Carbide and Carbon Company, Lock
heed Aircraft Company, Robertshaw, and 
the Sloan Foundation have established simi
lar scholarships. These organizations show 
a knowledge of the problems of higher edu
cation today and they realize thatusing 
Tech as an examplethe students tuition 
only covers 52 per cent of the cost of in
struction.
The principles set forth by the Sloan 
Foundation show an understanding of the 
colleges basic problems today.
1. That vigorous private education at all 
levels is vital to the health of the Ameri
can way of life and the American edu
cational system and that, consequently,
American business has a responsibility to 
support private education.
That there is a constant and ever-expand
ing need in our society for leaders of high 
character, sqund personality, and exact 
training who have been imbued with ideals inherent in our 
American spiritual and political heritage. We believe pri
vate institutions are particularly successful in developing 
this kind of man.
That philanthropic organizations, business, and individuals 
should, in making grants of all kinds to education, take into 
account the fact that tuition and fees paid by students do 
not cover the cost of education and overhead.
Several other large industrial firms have adopted dif
ferent approaches to the problems. Bethlehem Steel pays 
$3000 to a college for every graduate it hires directly from 
an institution. General Electric Corporation has adopted the 
policy of matching any alumni contributions made by its 
employees to a college. The only stipulation being that con
tributions from any alumnus will not be matched if they ex
ceed $1000 for a given year.
These programs are excellent but are little more than 
stop-gap measures as far as the situation here at Tech is 
concerned. For several years the school has had a difficult 
time making ends meet at the end of each fiscal year. The 
shortage each year has been made up by additional aid from 
industry, alumni contributions, and government contracts. 
Although Tech is one of the most heavily endowed schools 
the income from investments has not kept pace with in
creased educational costs and overhead. To put the school on 
a sound financial basis large contributions are needed that 
can be added to endowment funds.
Each organization and corporation that adopts, a formal 
program can almost be written off by the administra
tion as a source of funds for endowment purposes. This 
seems to be the general trend in industry today and the time 
is not too far distant when every organization capable of 
donating large sums will have some type of formal program. 
The administration should give serious thought to this prob
lem and devise a program that will put the school on a 
sound financial basis. P.D.C.

Over The 
Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewc
Ill wager that the advertisement for Springmaid Sheets is the most widely read advertisement 
for sheets in the United States. This conclusion 
is easily drawn if you have ever read one of their 
ads. Buxom, shapely lasses always decorate them 
and the ads are always accompanied by an ambi
guous caption. Though often times the captions 
are a little vague, they are always subtle in one 
sense or another. Yessir, about as subtle as a ton 
of bricks.
The week-end which I consider to be the most 
enjoyable of the school year will soon be upon us. 
Of course I speak of Greek Sing and Swing. Though 
much effort must be extered to make this event a 
success, there is not that complete and fogging 
fatigue that makes classes starting again an enjoy
able thought. Strange as it seems, Homecoming and 
Spring Carnival have this effect on many people.
* * *
Valentines Day is past. Did you get a valentine? 
Ive always been surprised that this holiday isnt 
celebrated with more enthusiasm. Other days 
which deserve celebration are St. Patricks day, 
April Fools day, and May day. The communists 
really celebrate May day with huge rallys and many 
displays. This is not the type of celebration I had 
in mind. The only rally I would like to see is a 
gathering around the festive board for a few sips of 
forbidden brew. Better cut this short before Im
investigated by Senator McCarthy and his pack of
bloodhounds.* * *
Little Quickies. Id say that attendance for the 
basketball games has been up this year. . . . How 
about giving the swimming team a little support. 
Their record is 8 wins and only 1 loss. . . . What has 
happened to the tradition of the fraternities seren
ading Morewood. I dont think serenades have been 
as frequent as they have in the past. Maybe spring 
will bring out the romance in the men again. . . . 
Have been listening to WRCT for the third year and 
I think it has been improving steadily. Their idea 
of a good music week was a good one. I think Ill 
do a critique of their programs in the near future. 
.. . Must give Skibo officials a pat on the back. The 
bus boys have been doing a very nice job the past 
few weeks. However, the coffees still lousy. . . . 
I certainly wish the weather would stay warm. 
Then there would be no excuse for the girls wear
ing knee socks. . . . Also, all the heavy clothing 
worn by the women during the winter months is 
not condusive to my hobby of girl-watching. . . . 
Girl-watching, is an extremely entertaining and de
lightful hobby.........Whos the joker that is stamp
ing everything Adults Only. Sounds like a 
banned movie.* * *
In closing let me remind you of the diplomatic 
gentleman who sneaked into his house at 4 a.m., 
removed his shoes, tiptoed upstairs, quietly un
dressed, and was about to get into bed, when his 
battle-axe wife stirred and murmured, Get down, 
Towser. So he licked her hand.

with the rest of the radio and television industry. 
The week is set aside every year in order to make 
people aware of good music. WRCT invites you to

every night from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. From now on 
Musical World will also feature all types of 
music. This is heard on Friday night from 8:00 to

to 8:30 p.m. This program features music and antics 
by the members of room 211 McGill Hall, who are 
in chorge of the program.
Public Speaking
Editor, the Tartan,
Recently I sat through a meeting of a campus 
professional society while one of the worst speakers 
I have ever heard extolled on the benefits to the 
engineer of proficiency in public speaking. He was 
absolutely right in his contention, but unfortunately 
it was the only idea he was really equipped to put 
across.
Here at Tech, an attempt is made to combat this 
lamentable condition with seminars for the en
gineers. But is this sufficient? At present the stu
dent makes his speech, and then is criticized on its 
technical content. Then an English instructor, who 
has been thoroughly confused by the technical 
content, criticizes the speech from the English 
standpoint, with the result that there isnt really too 
much valuable constructive criticism that can be 
presented. When it is presented, the speech has been 
finished, and it will be a matter of weeks before 
there is any occasion to put the criticism to use. 
The result: most of the criticism is forgotten.
Actually, what is needed here is a course in 
public speaking before enrolling in a seminar, and 
taught by a full time professor in speech, trained 
to detect flaws and train good speakers. A class 
meeting twice a week would give students oppor
tunities to make several short, non-technical 
speeches while they learn the techniques of public 
speaking for use later in seminars.
A plan of this sort is in effect in all liberal arts 
colleges, and would be a worthwhile addition to the 
Carnegie Plan too, as it would produce a class of 
engineers more capable of presenting their ideas to 
others.
Sincerely, 
William Whitworth

Skibos Turn Back 
Case Tech, 91-73
Skibos Are Hot in First Half, Gain
25-Point Margin Over Youngstown
Still smarting from the upset suffered at the hands of 
Youngstown Penguins, the Tartans put on a first half dis
play of excellent basketball, with Ralph Mocker leading the 
way with some eye-opening passes and shots, as he dunked
in 19 points in that period. ?----------------------------------------------
The second half was a different
story as the Rough Riders from 
Case came roaring back, trailing 
by 29 points, to cut the margin 
only ten points in a matter of 
minutes. Led by Joe Girlando, 
Case managed to engineer 31 
points in ten minutes of the sec
ond half. Girlando himself dunked 
in 9 baskets during this flurrey.
Boyd to the Rescue 
After calling a couple of time 
outs, Tech reorganized itself and 
once again took charge, as Jim
mie Boyd started shaking himself 
free and was able to drive under
neath nd dunk in eight buckets 
against Cases zone defense. 
Boyds shooting plus A1 Franks 
board work brought the lead back 
to 20 points where it stayed as 
Tech bagged its eleventh victory 
of the campaign, 91-73.
Mocker Leads the Way 
The game started off a little 
slow, but the pace rapidly quick
ened and by the middle of the 
first period the Plaid had a size
able lead, the score standing at 
25-13. Mockers deadly set shoot
ing and excellent all around play

seemed infectious, as the Tartans 
went to work and played like 
world beaters with Dick Fieler, A1 
Frank and little Eddie Miller, a 
surprise starter, turning in stellar 
performances.
On fast breaks, Mocker was 
teaming up with Fieler and Frank, 
who were passing behind their 
backs underneath the basket, and 
generally giving a good account of 
themselves. The halftime score 
was 50-25.
Girlando Scores 29 Points
With the beginning of the sec
ond half Case switched to a zone 
defense which slowed down the 
action for a while until Joe Gir
lando took charge of the game by 
himself. Case was behind 29 points 
when the slender, bespectacled 
sophomore started stealing the 
ball and sinking shots all over the 
court. He was virtually a terror on j 
defense, with his arms and legs in 
constant motion. In a matter of

Returning home from their trip4

then came back Saturday after
noon to swim away from the vis
itors from Ohio, Fenn College,

In both of these meets Bill 
Aiken, captain of the swimming 
team lowered his own record for 
the orthodox breaststroke Wed
nesday against Indiana, Bill posted 
a time of 2:39.8 and Saturday, 
against Fenn, lowered this mark 
to 2:37, for a new pool record.
This week the swimming team 
will meet Grove City Wednesday 
at the Tech pool. The starting 
time will be 4:30 p.m. This meet 
will close out the home schedule 
for the aquamen, as they finish 
out the schedule Saturday at Alle
gheny. After these two meets 
there remains only the Penn-Ohio 
meet. How well Tech does in 
these next two meets will deter
mine whether or not the PennOhio crown will return to Carnegie 
Tech. Both Grove City and Alle
gheny will be fielding strong teams

Penguin Shooting Average Soars

Youngstown gave the Tartans quite a jolt last Thursday night, 
as their sharpshooting exhibition in the second half was sufficient to 
provide the Penguins with enough of a lead to prevent the Skibos 
from overtaking them with a late rally.

minutes the lead had been reduced 
to 10 points with the score at 66- 
56, during which time Girlando 
had sunk nine shots in a row for 
Case. But Case and Girlando 
couldnt keep up the pace as Tech 
once again forged far out in front 
and stayed there for the remain
der of the game.
Individual scoring honors went 
to Girlando, who wound up with 
29 points on 14 field goals and only 
one foul shot, while teammate 
Hollis netted 22 points. The Tar

on nine field goals and five fouls, 
while Ralph Mocker put 21 points

Th beautiful Bel Air Sport Coup* with Body by Fisher
Its highway robbery!
For sheer fun out on the road, 
Chevrolet's stealing the thunder 
from the high-priced cars!
Up to this year, maybe there were reasons for wanting 
one of the higher-priced cars. If you demanded some
thing really special in the way of driving fun, you 
simply had to pay a premium to get it.
Not any more! The Motoran\ic Chevrolet has changed 
all that. Who could wish for more excitement than the
new 162-h.p. Turbo-Fire V8 delivers? (For those 
who do, 180-h.p. is optional at extra cost in all V8 
models.) Chevrolet also offers the two highest powered 
sixes in its field.
Come in and see how the Motoramic Chevrolet is 
stealing the thunder from the high-priced cars!

Sigma Delta Phi 
Observes Founding 
With Dinner, Dane
The fifteenth anniversary of the 
Sigma Delta Phi fraternity was 
celebrated with a dance and buf
fet dinner at the Chalfant Fire 
Hall Club. A crowd of approxi
mately 60 had an enjoyable time 
dancing, eating, and playing 
games.
George Bogovich, able producer 
of unusual entertainment, came 
through with several ingenious 
games. Included were a hat mak
ing contest for the fellows, bal
loon blowing for the girls, and a 
hunt by the group for unusual ac
cessories on each others clothing.-
Prize winner included Ed Daly, 
George Riffle, Dan Smyers wife, 
Will Schnarrenberger, and Frank 
Polma. Prizes included an electric 
clock, donated by Ace Television; 
cards by Loreskis; magnetic potholders, by Dormont Tire Shop; 
and gift certificate by Fallers. All 
door, prizes were donated through 
the courtesy of the Monroeville 
Shopping Center.

At a recent meeting of the Eve
ning School Newman Club, Emily 
Muhic was appointed historian 
for the organization. Her duties 
will entail the collection of pub
licity data (newspaper articles, 
photos, etc.), all of which will be 
mounted in Sketch Book of An
nual Activities. Being a consci
entious and thorough worker, it is 
felt that Emily is well equipped to 
do an outstanding job.
"Shun idleness  it is the 
rust that attaches itself to the 
the most brilliant metals.
On February 13, Sigma Delta 
Phi fraternity held their annual 
election. The new officers for this 
year are: President, Matt Ber
tovich; Vice-P resident, Ray 
Schwalm; Secretary, George 
Dawes; Treasurer, Edward Daly; 
Social Chairmen, Andy Spisak and 
Vince Golobic. Jim Soltis did an 
excellent job as president this past 
year, and we are sure that Matt 
will continue the good leadership.
One of the best things to 
have up your sleeve is a 
funny bone.
During spring term registration, 
approximately 50 new names 
were added to the Newman Club 
membership roster. Those mem
bers responsible for such a wonderful job were: Bill Bond, Bill 
Groll, Chuck Labee, Kathy Galli
gan, Vince Golobiv, Anna Mae Legosh, Joan Mack, Theresa Defino, 
and John Van Holt. Many thanks 
to Elvira Loresky for her work on 
the very eye-catching membership 
posters.
So live that you wouldnt 
be afraid to sell the family 
parrot to the town gossip.
Phi Gamma Pi sorority held its 
monthly meeting at the Carnegie 
Union on Sunday afternoon, Feb
ruary 13. This meeting was held 
especially to welcome new mem
bers to the organization. Mrs. 
Hackett, Dean of Women at Car
negie Tech, was introduced to all 
the members and spoke a few 
words to the group.
Plans were made for the forth
coming dinner to be held on Sun
day evening, February 27 at the 
Carnegie Union. This promises to 
be a very successful affair with a 
menu featuring baked ham and 
scalloped potatoes to be prepared 
and served by the girls them
selves. This dinner is held by the 
old members as a welcoming ges
ture to the new pledges. Of course, 
the pledges get their chance to 
reciprocate later in the semester 
when the old members look for
ward to being served a dinner in 
their honor.
Wives who cook and do the 
dishes
Should be granted these three 
wishes;
A grateful mate  a well
kissed cheek,
And a restaurant dinner every 
week.
Evening School Newman Club 
will begin its Lenten discussion 
series on Sunday evening, Feb
ruary 27, 1955. On this Sunday will 
commence a series of discussions 
sponsored by Newman Club to be 
held every Sunday evening during 
Lent at the Carnegie Union. The 
talks will be delivered by quali
fied, well-known priests and will 
j feature marriage as the central 
topic. This series of lectures 
should appeal to all our married 
and single members and everyone 
is invited to attend and friends are 
most welcome.
Easy street is hard to 
find.
Seventy-five couples danced to 
the very danceable music of Baron 
I Elliot on Saturday evening, Febj ruary 12. Poor weather and the 
I basketball game between Tech and 
Geneva were responsible for the 
disappointing turnout, but all who 
attended had a very enjoyable 
evening.
If the power to do hard 
work is not talent, it is the 
best possible substitute for it.
Monte Carlo
Everyone is reminded of the 
Monte Carlo coming on March 
19 at the Carnegie Union.
