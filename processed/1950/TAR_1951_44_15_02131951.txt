Summer Camp, 
Commission
VS Air Force To Seek Cadet 
Candidates On CIT Campus
Juniors And Seniors Have Chance For Pilot 
And Navigator Training Following Graduation
Juniors and seniors interested in officer opportunities in the U. S. 
Air Force will have a chance to find out all the answers next week 
right here on the campus. A United States Air Force Aviation Cadet 
Selection Team will be here from Monday, February 19 to Friday, 
February 23 in IH 238 B. <
According to Major George F.
Brodie, who is making arrange
ments for the team, this visit is 
one of the many being made to 
accredited college campuses this 
year by U. S. Air Force officers to 
provide college graduates with in
formation on. Air Force officer 
training. The selection team will 
be ready not only to answer all 
questions, but also is equipped to 
process any Carnegie Tech men 
who qualify.
Three Courses
Major Brodie stated that there 
are three courses of training be
ing offered to qualified men.
1. Aviation Cadet Pilot Train
ing consisting of one year of in
tensive schooling in all phases of 
aviation. Cadets receive $105 per 
month during training and upon 
graduation are awarded commis
sions as second lieutenants. Or
dered to active duty as flying of
ficers, these men earn pay and 
allowances amounting to almost 
$5000 per year.
2. Aviation Cadet Navigator 
Training consists of a years 
schooling in the latest techniques 
of radar navigation. Cadets re
ceive $105 per month during train
ing and upon graduation are

Duquesne Overpowers Carnegie
Carnegie Techs fighting basket
ball five gave Duquesne University 
a good scare in the annual battle 
of the two teams at Duquesne 
Gardens last night, but a second 
half comeback by the Dukes spoil
ed all chances of an upset win for 
the Skibos.
Coach Mel CratsleyS stalwarts 
battled the heavily favored Du
quesne five to a 25-25 halftime 
deadlock but couldnt keep pace 
with their city rivals during the 
second half.
Halftime Deadlock 
Paced by Tom Craig, who had 
one of the best evenings of his 
career .at Carnegie, the Tartans 
staged a comeback of their own 
during the first half to draw even 
with the Dukes at intermission. 
Behind by 23-12 midway through 
the initial stanza, the rampaging 
Scots roared back to deadlock the 
count at halftime.
The Plaid five stayed with the
Dukes until the five-minute mark 
of the second half, when the Red 
and Blue led by only 34-33. From 
that point on, however, it was all 
Duquesne, as the Dukes couldnt 
miss and the Tartans couldnt 
match their shooting of the first 
half.
Craig led the Plaid scorers with 
11 points, while center Bill Farbacher followed close behind with 
10. Forward Art Goldberg paced 
the Duquesne attack with a total 
of 17 markers, with Hal Cerra 
notching 14 on six fielders and a 
brace of fouls.
Lead In Fouls
Only in one department did the 
Skibos overshadow their oppon
ents, that being in percentage of 
fouls made. The Tartans sank 15 
of their 21 foul tries, while the 
Dukes had to be satisfied with 12 
out of 18.

Editorials
The Long Grind
The administrations decision to require a summer session 
for the present freshman engineering class and to allow en
tering freshmen to begin an accelerated program this June 
is due largely to the present state of national emergency. 
Effects of the new program will undoubtedly be felt in all 
phases of school life.
Uncertainties in the future draft laws make it impossible 
to predict how this accelerated schedule will change deferment 
possibilities here at Carnesrie, but it is probable that draft boards 
will turn a more tolerant eye upon students Mho attend classes 
the year roundespecially those whose numbers come up in the 
summer months. Another point in favor of the program is the 
fact that entering freshmen will be able to begin ROTC train
ing at an earlier date, thus further increasing deferment possi
bilities.
However, there are arguments on the other side of the 
ledger as well. Many students depend to a great extent upon 
summer earnings to finance school expenses; this source of 
income will be cut off from those affected by the new pro
gram. In addition, there are probably many individuals who 
are reluctant to attend college 12 months of the year, feel
ing that the grind is just a little too much. The incentive 
necessary for hard work and application to ones studies seem 
to be greatly reduced in the hot summer seasonespecially 
when everyone else is playing golf, watching a baseball 
game, or making a mint on their summer job.
Fraternities on campus, already beginning to feel the 
pinch of the draft on the membership, could be hard hit by 
the new program. Chapters which have large local member
ships, or which presently have large freshmen classes, will 
be in the best positions for summer rushingbut they, as 
well as the rest, will face serious problems. Granted that 
they can secure pledge classes in the face of the present un
certainty of college life, they will still face the prospect of 
carrying on pledge training programs with a limited number 
of actives most of whom will be newly-initiated fresh
men. Of course, one solution would be to defer pledging 
till September, but this amounts to delayed rushinga pro
gram Carnegie fraternities have frowned upon.
Since the accelerated program will apply only to the freshman 
and sophomore levels, the administration must feel optimistic 
about deferment possibilities for next year's Junior and senior 
engineering classes. At the present time, such deferments are 
in the hands of individual draft boards and there are no clear 
cut procedures, but technical personnel are essential in any mod
ern military organization, and it is hoped that Washington will 
take account of this fact in future draft law revisions. The in
ternational picture is so uncertain, however, that any long range 
predictions are alifiost totally worthless.
The program is born of necessity and is probably the 
best solution to a knotty problem. One bright note is the 
Greeksthink of the throngs of engineers who will retire 
to its inviting shade on those days when even water-cooled 
slip sticks refuse to function!
Tartan Green Has Gone To War!
The seniors who have ben wondering whether they 
would ever see a green Carnegie Tech campus again be
fore they bid old Tech farewell may rest at ease, for the 
Tartan has heard from very good sources that the several 
thousand feet of mud-filled ditches that has converted the 
campus into a maze will be filled before commencement time.
With the mur-covered sidewalks making walking to 
and from classes a very sticky job, it might be a good gesture 
on the part of the administration to flood the ditches and 
allow students to traverse the campus in Venetian-style via 
gondolas.

INFORMATION, PLEASE . . .
Wonder if someone could furnish 
a certain CIT basketball score for 
an alumni? Last Friday, a Car
negie graduate who stopped into 
the Public Relations office was 
looking at this years basketball 
schedule. He frowned, then quer
ied, Who won the game with 
Pending on December 6?
BLUE ROOM . . . Many people, 
seeing the bright blue walls of the 
remodeled rooms on the first floor 
of IH, have gotten the mistaken 
idea that a shower room was be
ing installed. No, it is not meant to 
be a shower room; it will be the 
quarters for the cashier and IBM 
offices.
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
. . . Student Council has decided 
to bequeath one of its possessions 
to Mrs. Hagins of Carnegie Union. 
About a month ago the Union 
hostess discovered a large corru
gated box in the basement stamp
ed, Student Council Property.* 
Although Student Council was 
dumbfounded to learn of this sud
den wealth, it lost no time in pass
ing the box back to Mrs. Hagins 
To dispose of as she saw fit.
THE ILLUSTRIOUS . . . Anoth
er alumni hit the news last Thurs
day when the Pittsburgh Press 
published a feature article on 
Phyllis Love. Phyllis, who gradu
ated from Tech two years ago, is 
now making theatrical headlines 
on Broadway.
SHADES OF LIL ABNER . . . 
This year the queen of the Thistle 
will probably be a lovely; that is, 
if you like the Daisy Mae type. Al 
Capp will judge twelve senior en
tries to pick the Thistle queen. All 
Dogpatch promises to turn out 
for the affair.
GOOD NEIGHBOR PLAN . . . 
Theta Xi fraternity has adopted a 
ten-year old Greek boy, Dimitrios 
Kaiafas.
EXAM SEQUEL ... As stu
dents recuperate from their ex
ams, many of them sigh, I dont 
know how I lived through it! 
Well, Fred Wolfe, the brother of 
author Thomas Wolfe, didnthe 
just didnt take the exams. Mr. 
Wolfe who attended CIT in 1916, 
confessed to a newspaper man re
cently, Incidently, I cpnfess be
ing kicked out of Carnegie Tech 
because I didnt want to take the 
examinations.

New Student Council
Ex-President Recommends Changes 
As Committee Heads Are Appointed
Student Council ended up last semester with the installation of 
new members, the election of Don Bickelman as president, and 
Paul Stettler as vice president. Former president Art Christopher 
made several suggestions for changes in Council.
The meeting was opened by A.4 
J. Moores announcement of the 
outcome of the election. These re
sults were accepted unanimously 
by Council. Final semester reports 
were given, consisting mostly of a 
resume of the committees activi
ties throughout the semester. Don 
Bickelman, in his report on the 
special committee, suggested that 
an organizational chart be drawn 
up showing the functions of the 
student bodies on campus and 
their relative importance. This 
chart would be designed with the 
major objective of clarifying 
Councils authority and limitations.
The reports were climaxed by 
several recommendations by Art 
Christopher. Art recommended the 
investigation of the status of the 
campus publications. He also felt 
that due to the lack of business to 
conduct, it would be a good prac
tice for Council to meet every oth
er week. His last suggestion was to 
amend the constitution to provide 
for a Council representation of 
one in every 200 students. This 
measure would reduce the present 
membership about in half, down to 
a working group of 15 members.

the final period, Geneva winning 
by an 81-61 margin.
Trailing by only 25-33 at halftime, the Skibos played the 
Covenanters to a standstill dur
ing the Third stanza. However, 
the departure of Bill Farbacher

foul rout'; early in the final quar

Plaid attack with 12 and 10 points 
respectively
Scare Westminster 
On Saturday, January 20, coach 
Cratsleys protege; almost pulled 
the upset of the year in the in
state district. Playing on the home 
court, th Ta.tans led highlytouted Westminster all the way 
before bowing in the last minute 
of play.
Two quick scores by the Titans 
in the ^st minute and a half stole 
victory from the rampaging Scots

Traveling to Gettysburg on 
February 1, the Skibos showed the 
effects of a week of final examina

the efforts of Hans Ackerman, who 
notched 13 points, and Bob McCullugh and Tom Craig, who gar

weaner Grove City five. The Groveis jumped off to a 13 point lead 
in the first quarter, and the Skibos 
were unable to overcome this lead.

1 the contest, the Tartans lost by 
a score of 73-62.

end of the third period.
In the last period, however, the 
opponents tallied 26 points to eke

the lead.
The CIT scoring parade was led 
by Tom Craig who accounted for 
17 points, while Thompson chip

The SAE's failed to win a single

Strong Title Bid 
The Raiders continued their 
strong bid for the title by con
quering both Sigma Nu and DU. 
The Raiders had little trouble pol
ishing off Sigma Nu 3-0, but were 
forced to go to the double match 
to beat DU. Arnold and Pugh won 
singles matches for the DUs, but 
Takshashi and Stein evend things

with Ziselman to defeat the DUs

In the American League, the 
Citcom Omicrons, the little Sekuds, 
and Theta XI-A are tied for first 
place, each with three straight vic
tories and no defeats after 10 days 
of play. So far the Omicrons have 
looked the team to beat. Their 
wins have all been recorded by 
impressive scores which include a 
64-5 steamroller defeat of the 
Markketeers.
Count PiKAs In
Both the other top teams, the 
Little Sekuds and xX-A could give 
the Omicrons a run for their 
money, although neither has re
