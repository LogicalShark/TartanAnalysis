After a booming start in Lincoln High School at Midland, Pa. on
Wednesday, Jarfuary 17, the Kiltie Symphonic Band and pipers open
in Oakland at the Carnegie Music Hall on the following Friday. Pro
fessor William A, Schaefer wields the baton that has led the band
*to an enviable reputation among 
college bands throughout the na

the best musical literature.
Detailed plans for the annual 
concert tour are now under con

been so numerous that routing 
problems are hampering progress. 
The trip however, will not be 
short. It will stretch to Eastern 
1 Pennsylvania and various borderI ing states.
A variety of selections designed 
I for all tastes will be presented at 
both of the concerts. Tickets for 
the Friday performance will be 
.available in Skibo or from a Kiltie

Dorm Council To Buy 
]New Sound Projector
Poll Shows 40 Percent Willing To 
Participate In Intramural Sports
Continuing its program to stimulate interest in dormitory activi
ties, Carnegie Dorm Council, at its last meeting before Christmas, 
approved the purchase of a 16 mm. sound movie projector. While 
intended mainly for Council sponsored functions, the machine, with
qualified operator, will probably' 
also be available to other organ
izations which wish to use it.
It was announced that a poll 
taken recently to indicate interest 
in intramural sports competition 
showed 40 per cent of the dorm 
residents willing to participate.
Projector Purchased
The projector, together with the 
television set in Carnegie Inn and 
a new P.A. system, is an attempt 
to provide adequate equipment 
for future activities. Carrying an 
excess of over a thousand dollars 
from last year, the dorm repre
sentatives have chosen to spend 
the bulk of it on things of a per
manent nature rather than on so
cial events that would be of 
benefit only to this years stu
dents.
According to the intramural 
sports PQll, 163 of the 414 resi
dents contacted are interested in 
competition in at least one sport. 
From a portion who were asked 
for preferences, the answer ranged 
from chess to football. The ma
jority of those unwilling to take 
part gave fraternity affiliation as 
their reason. A general athletic 
committee, headed by Bob Chubboy, has been set up to manage 
the sponsorship of dorm entries 
in the sports program.
More Activities
Council president Dick Lutz 
stated that any proposed all-dorm 
activity which indicates probable 
success can be sponsored bj' his 
organization. This includes both 
intramural teams and new clubs. 
The Focal Plane Camera Club, 
now in the formative stages, is a 
step in this direction.
It was stressed that necessary 
equipment or funds for such proj
ects will be furnished by Dorm 
Council.
Tutoring
Are you worrying about 
finals? Tau Beta Pi can help 
you. The schedule of tutoring 
classes appears on the last 
page of this issue. The slide 
rule instruction which was 
cancelled because of the snow, 
will be given on Monday in 
1H-208 at 4:30.
Freshman Dance
The class of 54 is beginning 
its social season with an in
formal snowball dance to be 
held in Thistle hall on Janu
ary 12 from 8 to 12. For music, 
the freshmen will have the 
DU band and additional enter
tainment will be presented at 
intermission. Advance sale of 
tickets has started and may be 
obtained from any class of
ficer.

Drama Department 
Schedules New Hit
The prize winning, record break
ing Madwoman of Chaillot by 
Jean Giraudoux will be present
ed by the Carnegie drama depart
ment, January 18-26. Sydney 
Spayde will direct the Carnegie 
version of this play which was 
such a tremendous success in Paris 
and later on Broadway.
Paris of 1924 is the setting of a 
conflict between the scheming 
Parisian aristocracy and the 
bourgeois, vagabonds, and mad
women as defenders of the right. 
The play combines realism and 
fantasy to effect an almost fairy
tale atmosphere. Dancing, singing, 
guitar playing and juggling create 
rhythm and movement suggestive 
of a musical production. In addi
tion to the three-dimentional scen
ery by Bob Barnes, the new pro
jectors will be used for backdrops 
in the show.
The play will be double with 
Angela Paton and Lois Pollack as 
the leading madwoman. The other 
madwomen include Sally Siedman, 
Hermine Dubroff, Marion Friedlander, Beverly Shaffer, Martha 
Lewin, and Shirley Pearl.
Student tickets will be availa
ble in. the drama office on January 
16 at 11:30.
Probation
After consultation with the 
Executive Board, Dean Miner 
has suggested that the proba
tion rules be slightly relaxed. 
The following modifications 
are now in effect.
Permit participation in not 
more than one intramural 
sport at a time for the purpose 
of keeping physically fit. Per
mit participation in Spring 
Carnival activities during the 
Carnival period but not in 
preparation before Carnival. 
Practice for Carnival sports 
events may be substituted for 
intramural activity.
These concessions do not 
change the prohibition of oth
er activities such as publica
tions, fraternity offices, etc. 
These changes are to be tried 
for the present school year, 
subject to revision if the re
sults are not satisfactory.

Editorials
Greetings !
As the world situation continues to grow more tense 
and draft quotas are increased, more and more students 
are seriously considering enlistment in the armed forces. 
The average junior seems to have very little hope that he 
will be able to return to college next fall.
One reason for these uncertainties is the present indefinite 
policy in regard to student deferments. Of course, such a policy 
is made necessary by the effect of the rapidly changing world 
situation on the manpower needs of the army. Since local draft 
boards have thus far had the final word in cases of this kind, 
and local conditions vary, there have been and will probably 
be wide differences in the treatment given college students. But 
before students  particularly engineers  consider enlistment 
they should recognize that there is a very good possibility of 
deferment until graduation and that this may become a general 
policy for all draft boards.
Another war would be one of specialization, technology, 
and production. Government planners, realizing this, have 
already advanced several tentative plans for selective de
ferment of college students. An example is the recently 
proposed Hershey plan, which calls for a general examina
tion to be given to all students and deferments to be based 
on these results; other plans would defer certain general 
groups of studentsparticularly those working in technical 
and related fields.
Although it is not probable that many will avoid military 
service altogether, a college degree will be of a great value. 
The modern army has become so complex that great numbers 
of specialists are needed from almost all branches of science and 
technology; though the day of the push-buttom war is still in 
the future, the drafting board and the proving ground have 
become as important to the army as is the infantry man.
There is no solution to the students dilemma and there 
will be none until the government announces a definite 
policy in regard to college deferments. However, it cer
tainly isnt wise to rush into the service to get a better 
deal when there is a good possibility that deferment, at 
least until graduation, can be obtained.
Out Of The Dark
The announcement on the front page of this issue with regards 
to limited participation in intramural and Spring Carnival activities 
should come as welcome relief to the many organizations who have 
been hoping to obtain such a move for many years.
However, interpreting it in a different and more general 
manner, we think it comes as an excellent example of how 
the students can achieve faster and better results in their 
attempts for changes on campus by merely working through 
the proper channels.
The first definite and well-planned move in the direction of 
changing probationary regulations was made by the Council of Fra
ternity Presidents last May, when confusion concerning eligibility in 
Spring Carnival participation irritated nStny of the fraternities, and 
further irritated the administration.
While there were diversified opinions over who was at 
fault in failing to clarify the rules before the last minute, the 
fraternities combined to present a letter of recommendation 
to the administration. These recommendations, not only 
cleared up the confusion over Spring Carnival, but succeeded 
in providing the student on probation with an opportunity 
to participate in one intramural sport.

Because of the serious nature of 
the times I think that a few words 
about practical military matters 
w'ould not be amiss. I realize that 
the ROTC is doing a fine job at 
Carnegie Tech but many times the 
practical aspects of a study become 
lost in the theoretical. Perhaps, 
therefore, some useful information 
might be gained by reading some 
true, factual accounts of army life 
as seen in my two and a half years 
as an army private.
Special Representative
Because I had never got caught 
doin nuttin to nobody I got a 
special invitation to enter the 
army. I was quite proud as I left 
my humble home in Brooklyn to 
serve our great country and in the 
course of my service I added an 
even greater pridepride in ever 
new achievements.
The first thing the army does to 
new entrants is to classify them so 
that they may be used. To their 
fullest capabilities, ol course! Be
cause of the great advances 
achieved in psychological testing 
and job placement by the armed 
forces during the war let us see 
how the placement system works.
Efficiency!
As the only job I had ever held 
before going into service was that 
of a delicatessen clerk, the first 
classification I received was that of 
machinists helper, and in line 
with this classification I was sent 
to Georgia for infantry training. 
Upon completion of this training
period I was re-ciassified as an ex
pert rifleman and in line with this 
classification I was sent to college 
to study engineering. Fate inter
vened, however, and I never com
pleted this training but instead I 
was sent to the maternity hospital 
to have my appendix removed.
After a month of recuperation, 
stolls along the boardwalk, and 
nightly dancing at Atlantic City, I 
returned to school to find that I 
was all alone, practically that is, 
for everyone of importance, in
cluding the students, had been 
shipped out as the army had clos
ed the program down, and the only 
people left were officers. At this 
time I dont know what my class
ification was but I think it was 
leftover, as I lived at home in 
Brooklyn and rode the subways to 
my work in the army every mornj 
ing. But there was a war on and 
this didnt last over a month.
A Volunteer
The next month I spent at Fort 
Dix driving a truck, something Id 
never done before. But I disliked 
guard duty, and when they asked 
who could drive I decided to learn 
by volunteering. The transmission 
was ruined anyway, so I couldnt 
hurt it much more. And the time 
I ran all over the post with a flat 
tire the sergeant just got angry 
and asked, Where the - - - did 
you learn to drive? When I re
spectfully replied, Im learning 
now. He just held his head and

FLASHBULB HAPPY . . . Pitt 
seems intrigued with our campus. 
Pitt photographers are constantly 
running around Skibo snapping 
pictures. The latest Pitt playup of 
Techs assets appeared in last 
months Panther where a page of 
pictures of Tech girls was fea
tured. Shirley Dixon, Mary Rita 
Grosswege, Karlin Johnson, Peggy 
Maurer, and Joan Ewig were 
chosen by the magazine as exam
ples of CIT beauties.
THAT GUY CORDIC . . Reg
Cordic is a popular man with this 
colleges students. In fact, the 
Kiltie Band just recently voted 
him the man they wrould most 
like to see in Kilts. So Cordic 
vowed he would have his picture 
took in kilts. That will indeed be 
a sight to see.
ITS LOVE . . . Now, the topic 
most discussed on campus deals 
-with rocks. The engagement rings 
flashed around since Christmas are 
a sure sign that spring must be 
in the air.
THE MIGRATION . . . Many 
students have wondered when 
Beta Theta Pi fraternity will move 
into the former Sigma Nu house. 
The big move will occur, the 
Betas hope, between semesters.
DRINK, DRANK, SUNK . . . 
The football players will really 
get a workout this spring; Coach 
Baker is sure of that. And he is 
so right! The evidence is tacked 
up in the bar of the Kappa Sigma 
house. It seems that after the 
Westminster .game the football 
boys decided to celebrate and 
Baker was there. One pitcher led 
to another, and at last the sign 
was written. It reads something 
like thisfor each pitcher drunk 
the boys will do a lap around the 
bowl this spring. The boys and 
Coach Baker affixed signatures to 
the document. There will be much 
running in the bowl this spring, 
according to the looks of that sign.
THE TAN MAN . . . Dean David 
is back from his Christmas vaca
tion in Florida. There is a nice 
tan on Ben.
THE DAY, PLEASE? . . . One 
economics teacher, Mr. Darling, 
was slightly confused about the 
date classes resumed after Christ
mas. The well-rested econ in
structor came back to school on 
January 4 from his vacation only 
to discover classes had started tl e 
day before. His ninety econ stu
dents who missed a class that day" 
are still celebrating.
APO PLAYS SANTA ... A Phi
O has again rendered service to 
the school. This organization pre
sented a beautiful Christmas tree 
to the Dean of Mens office, and 
Christmas color was added to In
dustries Hall.
EYESORE . . . That vacant 
house that stood beside Morewood 
Gardens has been razed at last. 
Apparently the residents of the 
gray stone house at Morewood and 
Fifth couldn't stand looking at it 
either.
LAZY BONES ... A student at 
Hastings conducted a survey to see 
if professors read all the term pa
pers required in a course. He put 
a clause in his term papier saying 
he didnt believe teachers read 
what students write and asked the 
instructor to underline the clause 
if he read it. The paper was re
turned unmarked.

The draft is a popular subject on Carnegie campus at the pres
ent time. The women students sigh when they think of a manless 
campus. After all, what would CIT be without its men?
That is a good question. No longer would Carnegie have a foot 
ball team. What would happen#--------------------------
to the Kiltie Band?
Of course, the college could use 
its woman power to perpetuate 
campus activities. For instance, 
women could play in the Kiltie 
Band. The inquiring reporter 
asked students, Do you think 
women should play in the Kiltie 
Band?
Adrian Fahle, senior: Frankly 
I dont think 
women should 
play in the Band.
For one thing, it 
has always been 
a mens organi
zation; I see no 
reason for wom
en to impose in 
the club. Be
sides that, I do 
not think that 
women would add anything; the 
men do a good job as iS. To tell 
you the truth, I have been waging 
an all out campaign against 
women messing in mens groups.
Bill Rowe, junior: There is no 
problem in worn- j
en playing in the 
Kiltie Band as 
far as dress is 
concerned. How
ever, if they put 
girls in the Band, 
it would destroy 
the impressive
ness of the or
gan ization. Financially it 
good deal more as 
is concerned: and 
behind the band 
would be destroyed. If women 
wanted to play in the Kiltie sym
phony orchestra it would probably 
add a great deal to this group.

Speaking from personal experi
ence, I know that playing the bag
pipes but not being able to
play with the Kiltie Band is one 
of my deepest disappointments.
Marilyn Seiner, freshman: I
think women
should play in
the Band. They 
have as much 
talent as the
boys, and there is 
no reason they 
shouldnt be al
lowed to play 
with the boys. 
It would proba
bly add glamor  
to the uniforms. I definitely think 
they should let girls twirl with 
the Band at least. I think that 
would be nice. I have never even 
seen majorettes twirl in the band 
around here. The uniforms are 
the kind girls would look better 
in than boys do.
Bill Flick, freshman: They

Women in kilts

The mediocre 3-3 record of this years edition of the 
Carnegie Tech basketball squad hardly seems to show the 
true worth of the team. Only Captain Mike Theodore and 
Jack Riehl are gone from the starting five of last years 
winning squad. With the addition of Kay Thompson and 
Bill Farbacher the kibos are potentially as strong as last 
year. One factor which may be contributing to the com
paratively poor showing of the team is a slight lack of
height.
Without doubt the most important missing factor is a good 
showing of team play. Several of the member of the squad 
appear to be all out for themselves. The game last Saturday 
against Slippery Rock was a classic demonstration of this point. 
Although he occasionally looked good on the court, Tom Craig 
was the chief offender in this reporter's opinion. Several times 
Craig had the ball in the front court and at least one of his 
teammates was open under the opponent's basket. Why he 
consistently refused to pass it around can leave the spectators 
with only one thought. Ball-hog! Craigs head-first dive into a 
group of players under the basket was the classic sight of the 
evening. Could it be that the fact that he made the starting
five in his freshman year has gone to his head?
Craig has the necessary attributes to be a great basket
ball player. He has a good shot from outside and he knows 
how to drive through the middle to take a pass for a layup 
shot. His play under the backboards is usually terrific. He 
has as much or more drive than any other man on the squad, 
and it is this spirit of drive that often wins ball games. If 
he would learn to think before he leaps it is certain that 
Craig could develop into one of the Tartan's all-time greats. 
However, if he continues as he has started this year, the 
future is very black for both Craig and CIT basketball while 
he is on the squad.
From all reports Hans Ackerman is the best set-shot 
artist on the team. So far this year his shooting has been 
good but not outstanding. To a spectator it appears that 
Ackerman doesnt exactly know what he is doing most of 
the time. Whenever he gets the ball he never seems to 
know what he is supposed to do with it. Ackerman doesnt 
seem to have the ability to work effectively with the rest 
of the team. If he could learn to play more smoothly on 
the floor, his worth to the team would improve a great deal.
Hilary Holste is one of the big question marks on the squad.
In several games Holste has really looked good. At other times 
his brand of play appears very sloppy. Holste has come a long 
way in the last two years and maybe with a few more games 
under his belt he w'ill settle down. It is a shame that Tommy 
Beck has been having so much trouble with his ankle because it 
has really slowed him down. As soon as the ankle sprain clears 
up, the diminuative little guard will really be able to once again 
show the stuff that he has displayed in previous seasons.
Of the starting five, Len Bianchi has been playing the 
best all-around game. Possibly his one fault is that he 
doesnt shoot more often. His outstanding contribution to 
the team has been his stellar defensive play. He appears to 
be able to hold opposing high scorers to a minimum of points 
by his close, careful guarding. This undoubtedly is why 
Coach Mel Cratsley has chosen him to guard Pitts Mike 
Belich.
Kay Thompson is one of the smoothest ball players on the 
squad. He is able to work effectively with the rest of the team, 
and he is also a fairly good shot. His fast reactions have re
sulted in his stealing the ball from enemy ballhandlers on several 
occasions. This boy should really turn into a fine ball player 
in the next year or tw'o.
Six Teams Enter Playoffs 
As Volleyball Leagues End Play
The past two weeks of the intramural season has been high
lighted by the ending of the league play in the three volleyball leagues.
In the Kiltie League the championship went to the team of Delta 
Tau Delta after they swept through a six-game schedule to finish 
the season undefeated. Second 
place in this league went to Sigma 
Nu with a record of 3 wins and 
three losses.
Citcom Wins 
Citcom, Clan emerged from the 
battle in the Tartan league with 
a record of six wins against no 
defeats to take the first place 
laurels. Close behind was Kappa 
Sigma with a record of five wins 
and only one loss.
The Plaid league saw a really 
close battle for the championship 
honors all the way down the line, 
finally ending up* in a three way 
tie between the Raiders, Delta Upsilon, and Pi Kappa Alpha.
In a play-off series the DUs and 
the Raiders started the ball roll

Tartans To Battle Panthers 
In Annual Grudge Contest
  - -----------------------------------   *  
Visitors Show 
Improvement; 
Seek Revenge
DEFENSIVE STAR VERSUS OFFENSIVE THREAT
- Len Bianchi, the Carnegie Tech floor teams defensive ace, will 
be particularly busy tomorrow night when the Tartans take-on the 
Pitt Panthers in Skibo gym. Bianchi has been given the difficult 
assignment of stopping Pitt's scoring star, little Mike Belich (inset). 
The 57 Panther forward has averaged 15 points per game this 
season and is expected to give the Plaid plenty of trouble when the 
Oaklanders pay their annual visit to the CIT court.
One of the games of the year for 
Tartan basketball fans will be on 
tap at the Skibo gym tomorrow 
night as the Carnegie quintet un
der Coach Mel Cratsley sets itself 
repel an attack from its old 
rivals, the Pitt Panthers.
The Panthers are expected to bo 
their peak for the game Wed
nesday. There is a little matter of 
two defeats by scores of 62-42 and 
66-59 at the hands of Carnegie last 
they will be trying to 
avenge.
Pitt Record Poor
The Plaid, however, will not be 
lacking incentive to win. A vic
tory over Pitt would put the Tar
tans ahead in the win-lose column 
the first time with a four and 
three record. Further incentive is 
any season with a win over 
Pitt is a successful one.
The Panthers have been taking 
lumps so far this year. After 
opening their season with a win 
small Gettysburg, they swung 
a Western trip of eight 
games and were soundly walloped 
in all eight. However, back on 
their home floor, the Panthers 
promptly reversed the procedure 
winning over powerful West
minster, who rolled over the Tar
tans by eleven points. Saturday, 
the Panthers turned over and 
played dead again to be upset by 
in-and-out Geneva 76-73. Their 
season record now stands at two 
wins and ten losses.

Slippery Rock
Both Teams Display 
Poor Offensive Form
The Carnegie Tech basketball 
team gained its third victory last 
Saturday evening by downing the 
Rockets of Slippery Rock at the 
Skibo gym, 62-51.
Getting off to a very slow start, 
the Tartans led by a 13-11 score 
at the end of the first period. Poor 
floor play by both teams spoiled 
several good scoring chances.
Plaid Settles Down
Early in the second period the 
men of Slippery Rock gained a 
slight lead, but two fast baskets 
by Kay Thompson changed the 
tide of the scoring and the Tar
tans were never behind during 
the rest of the game.
Starting the second half with a 
26-21 advantage the Plaid offense 
settled down. Employing the giveand-go style effectively, the Skibos soon pulled away to pile up a 
substantial 15 point lead.
Sloppy Play
The Tartans showed that they 
definitely have the ability to cut 
loose with a good scoring spree, 
however, poor team play by sev
eral of the members of the squad 
prevented many of Mel Cratsleys 
plays from clicking.
High men in the scoring column 
were Holste and Farbacher for the 
Skibos with 11 points apiece. Craig 
and Thompson were close behind 
with 10 and 8 points respectively.
Topping the scorers for Slip
pery Rock was Don Black with 10 
points. Goltz and Denniston con
tributed 6 and 7 points respectively 
to the losers cause.

record. They have an edge on the 
Plaid from the extra experience 
and polish gained in the additional 
games they have played against 
high calibre Western opponents. 
Scouting reports from the West
minster game indicated that Pitt 
is a much improved team from last 
year.
Pitt will floor a well-balanced 
team against the Tartans. At for
wards will be Mike Belich and 
Mickey Zernich, who have con
sistently led the Panther scoring 
parade. Belich is probably the 
most dangerous man on the team 
as he drives and hits from any
where. Slated by Cratsley to put 
the handcuffs on Belich for the 
Tartans is Len Bianchi. Bianchi 
has consistently played outstand
ing defensive ball for the Plaid 
and ranks with any defensive 
guard in the district.
Allegheny Saturday
Starting at guards for Pitt will 
be George Hromanik and Bob 
Yurko. Don Virostek finishes out 
the five at center. The Panthers 
will have more height on the 
boards than the Tartans as Yurko, 
Zernich, and Virostek measure in 
at 6-2, 6-3, and 6-5 respectively.
Doc Carlsen, nationally famous 
Pitt coach, can be counted upon to 
have a few tricks up his sleeve, 
and Tartan coach Mel Cratsley, 
who makes up in ability what he 
lacks in reputation, will have the 
Skibos ready. The game Wednes
day night should be anybodys ball 
game.
Saturday the Plaid travels to 
Meadville for an away game with 
Allegheny. Last year the Tartans 
swamped the Hilltoppers 61-40 
and are hoping to repeat this year 
with another win.

said Oh! It always pays to be 
respectful.
I was finally sent to Staten 
Island, which is across the river 
from Brooklyn. Everyone thought 
that I was a crippled veteran 
when I arrived and they treated 
me swell. You see, the last night 
at Fort Dix I sprained my ankle 
playing basketball, and after the 
doctor fixed me up I hobbled 
around for three months.
NextMedical Corps 
The morning after my arrival I 
entered the office for classification 
and placement. Here I was a ma
chinists helper, expert rifleman, 
engineering student, crippled vet
eran, looking forward to new hori
zons in themedical corps.
When I was called into the in
ner sanctum, I saluted the Lieu
tenant and stood at attention. The 
Lieutenant said At ease and the 
first sergeant said Sit down. 
Here I was again, getting an inter
view.
The Lieutenant looked at some 
papers on his dek and then asked, 
Do you play the bugle? I replied, 
No sir. He looked at the papers 
again and then said, I see that 
you played the E flat alto horn at 
Camp Upton. What is it?
- New Horizons 
Some guys just dont know 
nuttin! I told him that the dog 
horn was the instrument that goes 
pa pa. when the baritone goes 
umph, you know, umph pa pa. Do 
you think you could learn to play 
the bugle? he asked.
I was calm, I didnt get rattled, I 
said to myself, Bugler: first call 
5:45, reveille6 a.m., mess call 
8, 12 and 5, retreat4 p.m., lights 
out10:45, and taps^11 p.m., Ill 
be a prisoner! I pulled my chin 
off my chest where it had been 
thinking and asked the fatal ques
tion, What else do I have to do? 
The Lieutenant looked pleased and 
said, Run errands.
Me, machinists helper, expert 
rifleman, engineering student, 
wounded veteran, an errand boy. I 
lifted my head high and said, I 
dont wanna be a' bugler. The 
first sergeant, aged twenty-three, 
looked shocked, and with tones of
1 a disapproving father stated flatly,
! Son, youre in the army now. 
The Big Chance 
Two w7eeks later I met the ser
geant and he asked me how my 
bugling was coming alond. Fine. 
I replied. The next day he asked 
again and I decided that I had 
better find a bugle and start prac
ticing. I entered the supply room 
and in my deepest tones, around 
high C, asked, May I have the 
bugle? Bugle? What bugle? We 
dont have a bugle. The bugle, my 
bugle, the one Ive been practicing 
on for over two weeks, they dont 
have one. ^
In time the sergeant told me 
The bugle is in the supply room. 
With visions of a beautiful, shin
ing, gold, fourteen inch bugle 
dancing in my head I ran to the 
supply room. May I have the 
bugle please? Youll have to sign 
the requisition sheet first. I sign
ed it and the supply sergeant 
reached under the counter and 
came up with six inches of dull, 
plastic, cavalry bugle. Do I get a 
horse too? I wondered.
The Debut 
I didnt want to practice, thei'e 
were sick people in the hospital. 
So after weeks of not practicing I 
was ready at last for my debut. 
At 5:30 I was gently awakened 
by being pulled out of bed. I 
dressed, grabbed my bugle, and 
moved toward the doorevery 
time the CQ pushed me. That was 
it!
As I stood there with music 
book in one hand, bugle in the 
other. And the instrument raised 
to my lipsthe windows flew up! 
Whats going on! What hap
