VOL. 44No. 21PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 1951
Eighteen candidates competing for the honor of Spring Carnival 
queen opened their active campaigns today with all indications that 
this years vote-seeking will be even more strenuous than last years 
wrhirlwind of events. ?
Colorful Carnival Float Parade 
Planned; Mardi Gras Theme
Ambitious plans for what will probably be the most colorful float 
parade in Spring Carnival history have been announced by this years 
float parade chairman, Bob Stevens. The parade is scheduled for 
Friday, May 11 at 2:30 p.m., immediately following the coronation of
the Carnival Queen. ?----------------------------------------------------
Mardi Gras has been selected
by the Carnival Committee as the 
general theme for this years pa
rade. Each fraternity selected 
three sub-topics in order of their 
preference, anc the committee an
nounced today the approved 
themes for the competing frater
nities.
ATO: Parade of Queens
BSR: Zulus Procession
BTP: A Stern-Wheeler Steam
boat
DTD: Champagne Floi t
DU: Spirit of Bacchus
KS: Contrast between Meaning 
and Celebration of Mardi Gras 
PK: St. Peter at the Golden
Gate
PKA: King Neptunes Court 
SAE: Confetti
SN: Mardi Gras Music
TDP: Latin Quarter Scene
TX: Development of Courtship 
The floats will be judged on 
originality* craftsmanship and ap
pearance, and appropriateness to 
Mardi Gras. There will be four 
judges, two on each side of the 
course in front of the gym. How
ever, none of the judges will stand 
together during the parade. Floats 
must keep at least 200 feet apart 
while passing the gym.
Trophies will be awarded to the 
first, second, and third place win
ners during intermission of the 
formal dance on Saturday night.

Operas Offered 
By Fine Arts 
This Week
For the first time in its history, 
the College of Fine Arts at Carne
gie Tech is presenting an opera. 
A production of Acts I and II of 
The Marriage of Figaro, by Mo
zart, and the complete opera, The 
Telephone, by Menotti is sched
uled for its last two performances 
tonight and tomorrow night in the 
Exhibition Room in the Fine Arts 
Building. Curtain time will be 
8:30 p. m.
Carnegies departments of mu
sic and drama are combining ef
fort to present the operatic pro
gram. Professor Lawrence Carra, 
acting head of the drama depart
ment, explained that the two de
partment^* havp cooperated before 
on operettas, such as Gilbert and 
Sullivan works, but this is the 
first time in the history of the Col
lege of Fine Arts that a fullfledged opera is being staged. 
Center Staging
We are also doing this produc
tion in the round, or arena-style, 
with the audience surrounding the 
stage. So this is really an experi
ment. Producing an opera in arena 
style presents big problems. For 
example, we have a 44-piece or
chestra to fit into the crowded 
picture.
Frederick Dorian, professor of 
music at Carnegie, is musical di
rector for Acts I and II of The 
Marriage of Figaro, while Jo

A Question Of Policy
Recent events on campus have brought up an old ques
tion: how far can or should the administration go in restrict
ing individuals or groups on campus and still be justified in 
its action? The answer lies in a proper interpretation of the 
relationships which exist between the student and the school.
A college can be likened to a communitya community 
of administration, faculty, and students. Further, it exists in, 
and has critical relationships with, the larger communities 
of the city, state, and nation. Though these different groups 
have found it advantageous to join in a common venture 
higher educationfriction often develops among the groups 
because of differences of opinion on how higher education 
can be best obtained and maintained. The student is naturally 
interested in the best education for himself, the short run 
view, while the administration must be concerned with the 
long range, over-all effect of school policies as well as the 
short run aspects of the situation.
It would be possible for the administration to take a hands 
off" policy with regard to student activities were it not for the 
fact that these activities, carrying as they do the name of the 
school, put in jeopardy the future of the school community. In 
other words, there must always be a limit on individual liberty 
when it affects the welfare of others.
We are all responsible for the health and reputation of 
the group, and this calls for responsible, as opposed to irre
sponsible, action. The health and well-being of the college 
depends on continued support from donating alumni, parents 
of prospective students, other educators, and its good name 
and reputation in the larger community, If this support is 
not forthcoming, the school community becomes sick and we 
all suffer.
In view of these conditions, it seems clear that a stu
dent entering a college must be ready to accept a social 
contract with that collegehe must be ready to give up 
some few of his personal freedoms for the good of the school 
community. When we attend college our every action re
flects upon the reputation of that college, and this reputa
tion in turn is critical to us as students and alumni. It 
seems logical, therefore, that the group must have some meth
od of protecting itself from individual actions which threaten 
the welfare of the group.
This is the answer to those who claim, and perhaps rightly 
so, that most restricted activities are not detrimental to the morals 
of the student, and those who claim that the sudent should be 
allowed to choose for himself what is right or wrong.
It is not a question of effect on the student or the quality 
of student judgment. Rather, it is a question of following 
a policy calculated to promote the future health and welfare 
of the school community.
SC President Explains 
Recent "Scot Action
Keep 'em Coming!
The Tartan welcomes letters on current campus prob
lems and will print as many as space limitations permit. 
However, since we do have definite space limitations, we 
request that the letters be as concise as possible, approxi
mately 200-500 words in length. In this way we can print 
more letters and give a better perspective to controversial 
problems.
Where the problem requires clarification from an in
dividual directly concerned, we relax this length restriction 
in order that the subject can be more completely reviewed.

To The Students:
In order that you, the student 
body, could get all the facts of the 
Scot situation, I asked the Edi
tor of the Tartan to allow me to 
write this letter. We hope that 
this letter will answer all the 
questions in your minds and per
haps give you a new insight into 
the problems which confront our 
publications.
The April issue of the Scot was 
removed from the market. WHY? 
Because of one entire page of libel
ous material. In order to protect 
Tech from the many possible law 
suits and maintain our good rela
tionships with the people of Pitts
burgh, it was deided to pull the 
issue off the stands.
We must remember that the 
Scot, by its constitution a variety 
(not humor) magazine, is publish
ed primarily for a college market. 
However, copies of every issue do 
come into the hands of parents 
and alumni who are prone to 
judge our student body by its 
journalistic efforts. Therefore, it 
is vital that each issue meet the 
high standards established by both 
the school and the Scot constitu
tion. The interpretation of what 
meets these standards has until 
now has been left in the hands of 
the Scot editor. The results you 
have seen. One issue taken off the 
stands and within this year at 
least one other issue threatened 
with the same action.
In addition to the embarrass
ment caused by such action, we 
must consider the financial prob-<- 
lems. All publications on our cam- j 
pus are insured against financial 
ioss by Student Council. Council 
expects, and is prepared for, any 
normal losses. However, the losses 
which result from removal from 
the stands are not normal. The 
amounts involved become very 
large and place an impossible 
drain on the resources of Council. 
Obviously, such actions cannot be 
tolerated from a financial point of 
view while the selling of degrad
ing issues cannot be tolerated from 
a public relations point of view.
The Executive Publishing Board 
of the Scot, made up of Editor and 
Business Manager of the Scot, 
two members of Student Council 
and the publications chairman of 
Council, convened to discuss the 
problems at hand. The facts as 
presented at that meeting are:
(1) Financial results do not de
pend entirely on the number 
of copies sold, but rather on 
the amount of advertising 
carried per issue. Here we 
must remember that no com
pany will pay for space in a
magazine which is removed 
from the stands.
(2) We have certain moral ob
ligations to the students, 
their families, the faculty, 
administration, and alumni 
regarding the type of mater
ial we print. Certainly we 
must protect the students as 
well as the school from ad
verse public opinion. We as 
students know, and as alumni 
later, must live in a com
munity which has formed its 
opinion of us and our school 
by what it reads in the city 
newspapers. Every action on 
our campus which creates 
headlines which tend to dis
credit us in those papers 
lowers the communities 
opinion of us. Why not be 
judged by the community as 
well educated young people 
with sound judgement rath
er than crazy young kids 
who are not capable of ap
preciating others viewpoints. 
Here at Tech every action 
and printed word must be 
answered for by the Insti
tution. As we protect the col
lege f * o m embarrassment 
and degradation we also 
protect our own standing in 
the community.
(3) The Scot by its constitution 
is a variety, not a humor 
magazine. Thus the humor 
presented must not detract 
from the quality of the other 
features.
(4) The editorial judgement on 
many issues did not show the 
same sense of values used by 
others, namely alumni, citi
zens of Pittsburgh, parents 
of our students and prospec
tive students, not to mention 
the many contributors to our 
endowment fund.
The problem then resolved it
self into one of helping the ed
itorial staff on its judgement on 
the value and quality of the ma
terial to be printed. This would 
help keep the Scot on the stands, 
insure revenue from advertisers, 
and thus insure the financial suc
cess of the magazine.
In order to solve the problem, 
the Executive Publishing Board 
presented the following resolution 
to Student Council:
(1) The constitution of the Scot 
hall be amended to provide for a 
faculty advisor to the editor of the 
Scot who shall work with the editor 
of the Scot and be responsible for 
all material published in the Scot.
it) The faculty advisor shall be 
appointed by the Dean of Students 
in agreement with the editor who 
is to work with the advisor.(3) When irreconcilable differences 
arise between the faculty adviser and 
the editor of the Scot eoneerning the
Students Split 
On Mac Arthur 
Controversy
A recent opinion poll taken on j 
the CIT campus revealed that the 
students were about equally divid
ed on their opinion of Trumans 
removal of MacArthur. The sur
vey was handled by a group of in
dustrial management seniors and 
was completed befofe MacArthurs 
address to Congress.
The result showed that 41 per 
cent of the students favored Mac- ^ 
Arthurs removal, 41 per cent op
posed it, while 18 per cent were 
undecided. A breakdown according 
to sex revealed that 48 per cent 
of the women opposed his removal 
while only 38 per cent of the men 
were opposed. There was no sub
stantial difference between vet
erans and male non-veterans 
opinions. However, more non-vet
erans were undecided.
Should Bomb China
The results further showed that 
60 per cent of the students be
lieved that the ground war should 
be restricted to the Korean penin
sula, while 15 per cent were unde
cided on this question. However,
38 per cent favored restricting the 
air war to the peninsula and 48 
per cent believed that air action 
should be extended.
Of those favoring the extension 
of the air war, over half specified \ 
bombing Manchurian bases and 
about one fourth mentioned China 
proper. The remainder said that 
the military should answer the 
question.
About 45 per cent of the stu
dents favored the use of Chinese 
troops against the Chinese main
land; 38 per cent opposed their 
use, 17 per cent were undecided.
For President in 1952
Nineteen per cent of the stu- 1 
dents, favored Eisenhower for pres
ident in 1952 compared to 13 per 
cent for Taft and 12 per cent for 
Warren. Two per cent voted for 
President Truman and 37 per cent 
were undecided.
Using statistical methods, the 
group was able to test the general 
sentiments while sampling approx
imately four per cent of the full
time students.
A critical step was the selection ^ 
of persons to be interviewed. 
Again statistical methods provided 
a means of giving each person on 
campus an equal chance of being 
chosen, thereby eliminating bias 
due to political beliefs, draft 
status, etc.
advisability of printing material, the 
Dean of Students will exercise final 
authority.
The resolution was adopted by 
Council and will go into effect im
mediately pending the approval of 
Dr. Miner and the executive com
mittee of the college, which must 
approve all actions of Council. 
However, the executive committee 
has had faith in, and accepted, the 
decisions of Council in the past 
so we expect approvalat least on 
a trial basis. Student Council and 
the Executive Publishing board 
feel that the Scot will continue to 
present material which will be ap
pealing to the students and yet 
satisfy the demands placed on it 
by those others whose judgement 
it must meet.
This then is the background, the 
present problem and the solution 
as we found it. We are, admitted
ly, groping in the dark. We dont 
feel that we have the ideal solu
tion. If any of you, the student 
body, have any suggestion to offer, 
please let us know.

Senior Ball
[Continued from page 1 ]
Since the dance honors graduat
ing seniors, it has been the opinion 
that the seniors themselves should
not be the dances sponsors as has 
been the custom in past years. 
This has opened the way for the 
junior class to undertake this tra
ditional project.

Tennis Team 
Starts Season 
Against Dukes
The Carnegie tennis team under 
Coach Frank Moses will open its 
season against Duquesne, Friday. 
Hampered by the lack of practice 
time and space and with few re
turning lettermen, the Tartans 
will go into the match as definite 
underdogs.
The match, originally scheduled 
to be played on the Carnegie 
courts by Margaret Morrison will 
probably be held on the Arsenal 
courts at the corner of 40th and 
Penn. Although plans were made 
early this spring to have the pres
ent courts recovered with asphalt 
by tennis time, the courts at the 
present are still in a state of dis
repair.
Coach Moses will be depending 
heavily on Bob Wiederhorn, Sam 
Forter, and John Montstream, re
turning lettermen, to carry the 
Carnegie tennis hopes. Missing 
from last years squad will be Bob 
Bassett and Ed Shoemaker, who 
have played out their eligibility.
Several new menBob Duffus, 
Don Duncklee, and Larry Cederstromhave reported and Coach 
Moses is hoping they will prove 
to be first-string material.
Soccer Season Starts,
4 Teams Undefeated
ATOs, Sigma Nu Grab Early Lead
Theta Xi, Emanon Close Contenders
With the arrival of spring weather, the intramural soccer season 
got into full swing on April 16. After the first week of play, four 
teams remain undefeated. Alpha Tau Omega, Theta Xi, Emanon, 
and Sigma Nu have posted unblemished records thus far.
The ATOs grabbed the leader-*
ship in the American League with 
a 3-0 chart. They had litle trou
ble in dumping Beta Sigma Rho 
6-1 in their seasons opener. Tom 
Astle scored all four goals as the 
ATOs downed Delta Upsilon 4-3. 
They continued their winning 
ways by trouncing the Phi Kaps 3- 
1 on April 20.
TXs Cop Two
Theta Xi posted the only other 
undefeated record in the Ameri
can League by garnering two vic
tories against no setbacks. The 
TXs registered shutout victories 
over the SAEs 4-0, and over the 
DUs 3-0.
In the National League Sigma 
Nu is setting the pace with three 
victories against no defeats while 
Emanon follows closely ^vith a 2-0 
chart.
The Sigma Nus own victories 
over Beta Theta Pi 3-2, PiKA 4-0, 
and Delta Tau Delta 8-1. Emanon 
boasts consecutive victories over
Kappa Sigma 2-1 and Beta Theta 
Pi 3-0.
Six Teams Winless
The Phi Kaps in the American 
League and the Delts in the Na
tional League each hold identical 
2-1 records, while the other six 
teams, the DUs, Beta Sigma Rho, 
SAE, Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma 
and PiKA have yet to win a game.

victory marked the first in recent

Never Any Doubt 
The win was sparked by the 
outstanding performa nces of 
Johnny Luchok and Irv Shechter, 
who both promise to improve 
over their records of this year. 
Luchok ran 50 yards for the first 
score and completed several long

the Skibo scoring with another 
long run. The outcome of the game 
was never in doubt.

Music Not Only Job 
Of Kiltie Bandsmen
By Dolly Mitchell
Of all the organizations on campus, the Kiltie Band is the larg
est, with a membership of 109. And the Band excells not only in 
size but efficiency as well. This is evidenced in the functioning of 
the organization. In fact, few students realize that the Kiltie Band 
operates like a small business. ?-----------------------------------------------

As in any business, the Band 
must meet operating costs. To raise 
capital to maintain its existence, 
the organization conducts concerts, 
and sells record albums, post cards 
and date books. Revenue raised 
from these projects is poured back 
into the Band in the form of uni
forms, instruments, and music. 
The record of such transactions is

kept in large, 
ledgers where

Files Important
No organization is complete 
without files and these too are an 
integral part of the Kiltie Band. 
Director Schaefer has set up a de
tailed file containing all the mu
sical scores, marching formations, 
and program plans of the organ
ization. In this way the Band can 
profit by past experience and build 
its reputation upon a solid foun
dation of recorded information.
Maintenance, too, plays an im
portant role in any enterprise, and 
the upkeep of uniforms and in
struments is a major maintenance 
job. Each piece of wearing ap
parel which is part of the complex 
Kilt uniform is assigned a num
ber, requisitioned and recorded. 
Each instrument is assigned a 
number and requisitioned. Finally, 
the cleaning, repairing and moth 
proofing of each uniform must be 
done once a year.
Paper Work
Mo business can exist without
paper work. For each of the sev
eral concerts presented during the 
year the Kilts have numerous mu
sical scores. When the band pre
sents original pieces written by 
Director Schaefer, 109 musical 
scores are copied for each selec
tion. Other scores are purchased 
and reworked; files are examined 
for still other numbers. Each time 
the marching band goes into a for
mation, hundreds of sheets of pa
per are represented in pictorial 
form, for every member has r< 
ceived mimeographed copies of the 
formation.
The planning program is neces
sarily detailed and comprehensive. 
Everything the Band does from 
marching to concert work has 
been thoroughly mapped out 
months before. During the sum
mer the general program is de
cided upon, and during the early 
part of the school term specific 
plans are developed.
Outstanding Organization
Each year the Kiltie Band has 
grown in numbers and standing. 
Its fine reputation both on campus 
and over the country is well estab
lished, and the factors which con
tributed greatly to this reputation 
are the efficiency of the organiza
tion and the cooperation of the 
members. As a band it is out
standing; as an organization it 
compares favorably with any busi
ness setup in efficiency.

SC Approves 
New By-Laws
List Committee Duties 
And Pick Chairmen
Evening Student Council held its 
monthly meeting, Sunday, April 1. 
The major portion of the meeting 
was devoted to the discussion and 
approval of additional by-laws to 
be installed by Council for the pur
pose of defining more clearly the 
duties of each member of Council 
and thus minimizing the possibil
ity of over-lapping of officers du
ties. As per approved-by-laws, 
duties of each committee are now 
outlined and the chairman of that 
committee is designated. Some of 
these chairmanships are definitely

Biscup Given Evening Student 
Award At Engineering Banquet
Recipient Serves As Westinghouse Foreman; 
Has Been Prominent In Extra-Curricular Work
Chester J. Biscup was presented the Evening Student Achieve
ment Award at the Thirty-Sixth Annual Engineering and Science 
Banquet held in the Roosevelt Hotel, Saturday evening, April 21.
Chester is a member of evening school of long standing, enrolling
in the school in 1928. His early?-------------------------------------- 
years were spent in the College of 
Industries where he was pursuing 
a course in electrical equipment 
and construction under Professor 
Ashe. After having received a cer
tificate in this course, he decided 
to continue his studies with a de
gree in electrical engineering as 
his goal.
Began Over
It was practically necessary for 
him to begin over again, for the 
courses he had taken previously 
in Industries were of a different 
nature than those required by the 
electrical engineering department.
Due to the pressure of his work at 
Westinghouse during the war,
Chester was forced to carry a light 
schedule at evening school. Ches
ter is perhaps the only member of 
evening school who has had a con
tinuous attendance from the mo
ment he first enrolled.
He has always found time, even 
with his crowded schedule, to de
vote his talents to extra-curricular 
activities. While taking part in

Luckies. You'll find that Luckies taste better than any 
other cigarette. Be HappyGo Lucky today!

was honored by election to various 
student offices consisting of presi

evening schoo1 campus; he is a 
member of Pi Delta Epsilon, na

president of Sigma Delta Phi. He 
is also an active member in ofTcampus groups.
He has recently been promoted 
by the Westinghouse Electric Cor
poration to the position of foreman 
of the engineering laboratory of 
the Atomic Power Division.
