Juniors !
co-chairmen of the dance decora
tion committee, have promised to 
transform the usually unsightly 
gym into the land of Mother 
Goose for the big Saturday night 
dance. Though most of the details for the May 9 and 10 holiday 
have yet to be completed, General 
Chairman Don Schumacher pre
dicts that this years celebration 
will be bigger and better than ever 
-both in entertainment and in

The originality and ingenuity 
always demonstrated by the com. peting groups combined with this

the float parade a particular suc
cess, said Schumacher. First and 
second place trophies will be 
awarded as in past yearsour 
biggest hope is that the weather
man doesnt repeat last years 
steady drizzle on the day of the 
parade, he continued.
Committee chairmen are already

Administration 
Draws Charge 
From PiDE
At a stormy meeting last Thurs
day the personnel of the various 
campus publications discussed the 
faults and frailties of the Tartan, 
Scot, Thistle and Technical.
Though no definite conclusions 
have as yet been endorsed by the 
general membership, President 
Pete West and two of the honorary 
societys invited participants in 
the discussion, Deek di Salvo and 
Marjorie Rex, prepared an opin
ion reflecting the purposes and 
justification of campus publica
tions, and how these ends have 
been thwarted and maligned at 
Carnegie. [See page six for the 
complete statement.]ATTENTION MEN

A group of juniors has been 
thinking of something the jun

they have hit 
on the idea of 
a Junior Class

is!) It could 
be a real ball

though we might restrict the 
attendance to juniors and 
guests only, we could, if we 
so desire, invite the whole 
student body and make it a 
party to be remembered. The 
date of Sunday afternoon, two 
weeks before Spring Carnival, 
has been suggested, as a sort 
of warmup for Carnival itself.
How about it? Weve thrown

School Fears UMOC 
Reign of Terrorism
High faculty and administration officials were thrown into minor 
panic last Friday upon the appearance of a multitude of mysterious 
signs around the CIT campus, proclaiming a vote on UMOC. Specu
lation has run high since then as to the meaning of the rash of pub................................................................ ?licity which has come forth.
Although the original emergency was declared over by a 
special meeting of the Board of 
Trustees, there is still a general 
state of apprehension among fac
ulty and students alike. Fear of a 
Black Hand uprising has subsided 
almost completely.
Suggestions as to the possible 
meanings of the occult letters 
UMOC follow:
Universal Monarch of Clubsa 
subversive attempt to destroy 
King Of Hearts publicity.
Unconventional Metamorphosis 
On Campus.
Underground Massacre Of Can
didatesa revolt against Student 
Council.
Etc., etc.
On being questioned on the 
meaning of the whole thing. Dr. J. 
C. Warner commented, It must 
be something that sprung up while 
I was in India.
Asked his opinion. Dr. E. D. 
Smith remarked, We must ana
lyze this problem carefully.
In the meantime, a triple guard 
has been thrown around the fac
ulty lounge, and all outgoing 
phone calls are being monitored. 
Full details on subsequent devel
opments will be included in next 
week's Tartan.

Editorials
Crying In Our Beer
Considering all the proposed revisions to the Tartan that 
have been brewing around campus in the last week, it seems 
its about time to clarify a few points concerning the pub
lishing of a college newspaper, and particularly at Carnegie 
Tech.
A campus newspaper is not suposed to t>e a collection 
of features or the center of a controversy, such as we have 
been in the past weeks; this function is reserved for the 
humor and variety magazines. From the fathers of the Fourth 
Estate we obtain the two basic goals of any newspaper, col
lege or city: 1) to report the news as it happens in an un
biased form; 2) to serve as a record of past events for the 
body being served.
But a paper accomplishing: these and nothing; else has the 
fate of not being read; hence the few features. A newspaper 
feature is not a treatise of flowery words nor is it built around 
some fictitious plot; but again the news, presented in a form that 
is more appealing to the reader than the run-of-the-mill news 
story. Is it impossible to fill a paper with this type of news 
story, though, because the inherent ability to write news features 
is found in a few, and seldom on the Tartan staff.
The college newspaper of today is under more restric
tions than the city paper. Besides serving as an organ to 
the student body, it reaches the hands of alumni, parents, 
and people who will be someday associated with the school. 
So, the same as a corporation newspaper, it cannot discuss 
all the newsy items without causing the school harm. 
This involves the important question, how much responsibili
ty does the school paper owe to the supporting institution?
The editors of a college paper have a moral obligation 
to their alma mater to be constantly striving to improve the 
reputation of the college and bringing to light its accomplish
ments. Besides that, rabble rousing doesnt -make good news. 
It leads the paper toward the gossip sheet classification. 
When a controversy arises that should draw the support 
of the school paper, it has to be first surveyed for all im
plications. Many times on this campus we only hear the 
radicals howling, and upon investigation, the bases of their 
arguments are shattered.
We're not crying in our beer; but the Tartan has a some
what more difficult job than the average paper. Tech isnt a 
school that is constantly popping out with a nice, newsy story 
that will appeal to all readers. Usually after our few reporters 
come back from across the Cut, we have nothing to print, and 
second investigation gives the small bulletins that often fill the 
paper. But, in reporting the various and sundry meetings at 
Carnegie, we are serving our purpose as a campus newspaper 
and we point to our high standing in the Collegiate Press contests 
as proof.
Well also readily admit that our news' stories could 
be much better written, the lay-out and headlines improved; 
but with- the same few people putting out the issue each 
week, ruts are bound to develop. The constant appeals for 
reporters and other personnel give us nothing, and so it is 
to be suspected that the quality will lessen as the few staff 
members work harder and longer for what they sincerely 
believe is a good paper. Too often the Tartan is compared 
to papers from colleges with journalism schools. We havent 
the talent or time allowed journalism majors to equal their 
publications.
The improvement of the Tartan or any other publica
tion at Carnegie doesnt lie with the editorial staffs; but with 
the general campus spirit. No great student interest in ac
tivities leads to no news. We cant publish all the idle 
whims of students, but the honest-to-goodness hard work of 
the student body in all campus activities would make an in
teresting and well read Tartan each week.

War Or Peace?
By Deek di Salvo
Which shall it bepacifism, or war if necessary to preserve our 
freedom? We find the twentieth century proclaiming that a Third 
World War is not inevitable and yet who is blind to the worlds 
preparations for that war? The two sidespacifism or defensive war
are razor edges; what is the case*----------------------------------------------------------
for both?
Pacifism, recognizing that war 
is morally wrong; that there is 
nothing to gain from war but 
death and desolation, proclaims 
that by nonviolent resistance to an 
aggressor that the aggression will 
be destroyed with time, for the 
aggressor will crumble of him
self. We have the pacificistic ex
ample of early Christianity. The 
beginnings of Christianity were 
seeds sown in the field of Roman 
might; seeds watered by martyrs 
blood; seeds that grew and bloom
ed out of the rot, the decay, and 
fall of Roman might. We have 
the modern example of Ghandi 
and his followers in India, where 
by passive resistance militant 
Britain was forced to surrender 
her Indian Empire. The two great 
gambles of love paid dividends, 
but how? Britain was forced to 
surrender India because her Euro
pean adventure is coming to an 
end, she has not the physical 
means to sustain suppression of the 
Indian peoples. Ghandi could pro
claim nonviolent resistance to 
British Imperialism and though 
there was limited suppression the 
basis of the British Nation mor
ally precented the suppression that 
is the province of dictatorship; thus 
nonviolence worked in India be
cause there was a moral base it 
was operating against and a na
tion who had not the will nor 
power to crush it. At the oppo
site end of the stick Christianity 
worked within the fabric of Ro
man justice. Though violently 
persecuted, Christianity fermented 
in the Roman mind that still pos
sessed the concept of Roman law.
In the end the Neros were deposed 
in the Roman desire to sustain Ro
man justice. Christianity flourish
ed as Rome tired and crumbled.
Consider the present! If the 
West surrenders passively to Com
munism, it surrenders not to an 
eclipsing power but to rising pow
ers; it surrenders not to a small 
minority of men but to vast em
pires of peoples; it surrenders not 
to foreigners but to communistic 
disciples in its midst; it surren
ders its ideals, if it surrenders for 
it gives it children up to com
munistic education; it surrenders 
not to a concept of morality or law 
but to power Without conscience 
that wipes out peoples, races, 
groupsany vestige of opposition: 
physical or mental. It does sur
render with the certain knowledge 
that with time communism will 
pass, but Oh God, How long? Can 
that surrender with love give birth 
to love in some future generation?
The case for Defensive War is 
just as sharp and just as thin. If 
there is a war, civilization as we 
know it will undoubtedly be de
stroyed. If in our defense of free
dom, we lose allwhat have we 
defended? Is the poverty and suf
fering that is the constant shadow 
of such a war worth the victory? 
Will governments rising out of 
such a chaos be governors of free
dom by love? It is doubtful that 
they will be such. If the human 
race survives at all, will or can it 
build again on the concept of the 
individual and his freedom? It is 
doubtful that it can. Which shall 
it be, pacifism or war? If the Cold 
Wars run red where will we stand? 
Whats your opinion?

Reader Replies 
To Academic 
Freedom Views
Editor, the Tartan:
I read with interest the recent 
editorial in criticism of the nar
row-minded conservatism of edu
cators and the apathy of students 
in general. While agreeing in sub
stance, I would like to call to mind 
some factors which may be even 
more important faults of our ed
ucational system today.
First, it is evident that the zeal 
of conversion of the young Com- % 
munist holding out the shiny 
promise of ideal Communism did 
not stem from the advantages oi 
our academic freedom. Nor 
could our knowledge of presentday affairs be objective if derived 
from pro-Communist educators. 
Granted that unrestricted study 
of controversial issues ... is es
sential to education in a free de
mocracy, the problem of form
ing responsible American citizens 
will not be solved by exposure of 
the student to differing ideologies, 
any more than a difficult decision 
is made easier by presentation of 
every alternative if right prin
ciples of judgment are lacking.
Democracy grew up in an at
mosphere of firm conviction and 
definite ideals on human dignity; 
today our institutions of higher 
learning profess no body of truths, 
at least in the fields of philosophy 
and morality, which they hand 
down to the students. How can an 
educator teach, unless he first be
lieves something he wants to 
teach? The sad fact is that the 
American university today seems 
to stand for nothing except aca
demic freedom to try to learn. 
Such an education is powerless to 
combat the idealism of Com
munism, however warped it may 
be.
Sincerely yours,
Robert Lechner, EE 52
i
We did not mean to imply that 
we advocate employing pxo-Com
munist educators, but only that we 
feel that freedom of discussion on 
and evaluation of the issues of 
Communismboth good and bad 
will aid in the struggle against
Communism. ...
. Pi)Clearly, you seem to favor a di
rected educationone that should 
supply the right principles of 
judgment to us alland you cite 
the opinion that our democracy 
grew up in an atmosphere of firm 
conviction and definite ideals on 
human dignity. but it is not at all 
clear that our history shows this 
to be true. Even today, there are 
many areas of human rights 
(travel through the South), eco-^jn 
nomic activity, or social behavior 
on which portions of the popula
tion differ strongly. It is good that 
they disagree, for out of disagree
ment will come a stronger society. 
The idea of a truth in philoso
phy or morality is particularly 
dangerousthere are no absolute 
truths, only truths which each in
dividuals determines for himself 
by his own reasoning and inter
pretation of data on men and na-tj| 
ture.
Someone who has evolved his 
own set of values and standards 
from a long exposure to ,all the 
relevant conflicting facts and opin
ions would seem to us to be in a 
much better position to defend his 
beliefs than one whose education 
has not admitted that any of the 
tenents of the existing system 
coud possibly be wrong.

Gym As It Will Appear For SnS
Complete Remodeling Planned
SnS Production Crew Plans 
Extensive Changes In Gym
) By Fred Sonnenberg
With eight short weeks between now and the opening of Good 
Heavens on May 6, Ken Rossignol and his crew of technical work
ers are set to begin their long seige on the Carnegie gymnasium 
to convert it into the new Scotch n Soda theater.
Probably the largest financial ?------------------------------------------------
undertaking ever undertaken by 
a campus activity without outside 
aid, the theater renovation is go- ing to cost several thousand dol
lars and be completely finished in 
ne year.
Raised Seats
By building this theater of its 
own, SnS will eliminate the three 
main gripes arising from past pro
ductions. Not being able to see; not 
being able to hear; and not feeling 
in the right atmosphere for a mu
sical (high girdered ceilings, glary&ng lights, and basketball game 
odors).
All the seats in the rear half of 
the theater will be raised, each 
above the other, to permit these 
spectators to see more than some
ones head. Curtains 30 feet high 
will be hung completely around 
the section of the building used 
Vfor the theater and should reduce 
the feeling of sitting in the mid
dle of the universe. Besides these 
maroon curtains, the stage will be 
completely lined with gray cur
tains ( this means the end of the 
old, traditional pink ones).
Indirect Lights
Sound engineers from Tydings 
Radio Co. in East Liberty are de
signing a sound system so comL*-plete that, a word, spoken 
normally, 25 feet back from the 
concealed mikes in the footlights 
will be heard easily throughout 
the theater. Hopes are also for an 
alternate sound system in case of 
failure in the primary one.
The overhead lights are being 
eliminated and soft, indirect light
ing wilPplay on the maroon cur
tains while the performance isnt 
on stage. These improvements will 
'make a noticeable transition as 
'the audience enters the theater.
Originating Scholarship 
Scotch n Soda will be indebted 
to no one, for the several thou
sand dollars is all coming from 
past profits. After starting the $100 
Scotch n Soda scholarship this 
year for a deserving participant 
in the musical production and 
contributing to the Deans Emer
gency Fund, Good Heavens will 
Btill show a profit.
Council Chided 
For Inaccurate 
Notification
By Dick Christensen
Ken Rossignol, representing the 
Scotch n Soda organization, com
plained to Student Council in 
meeting last Wednesday that 
Council does not publish adequate 
or accurate notice of its actions 
and rulings. He cited specifically 
the freshman regulations ruling 
requiring all campus organizations 
under the jurisdiction of SC to 
submit a list of their members to 
Council.
Rossignol said that conflicting 
statements of the ruling appeared 
in the Tartan; and that because of 
this confusion, Scotch n Soda did 
not submit its list. He asked that 
in the future SC publish official 
notices in the Tartan regarding 
such rulings in order to eliminate 
the possibility of misunderstand
ing.

operettas during her short career.
Jack is also a transfer student, 
switching from Bloomfield, New

End Winning Season
Win Over Grove City Produces 
Season Of 14-9-A 13 Year Boast
Craig Stars 
For Tartans
Selected On Tri-State 
District All-Star Team^
By Cal Biesecker
Carnegie Tech owes a vote of 
thanks to the borough of East Mc
Keesport. This little town, just a 
few miles each of Pittsburgh on 
Route 30, is the home of Tom 
Craigone of CITs more remark
able athletes.
For the past three winters, Tom . 
has been a standout on the Tarteu 
basketball squad in addition to 
starring as an end on Dr. Eddie 
Bakers 1951 pigskin eleven. Tom, 
a junior in the metallurgy depart
ment, has been able to combine his 
athletic prowess with a pleasing 
personality to become a popular 
figure on the Carnegie campus.
Best Performanced t IThis past season Craig had hij 
best year since he started cavort
ing on the hardwood for coach 
Mel Cratsley. His season total of 
398 points accumulated on 156 
field goals and 86 foul shots in 23 
games places him fifth among the 
leading scorers in the Tri-State 
college floor show.
Considering those who stood^  
ahead of Craig, his record is eveR 
more impressive. Preceding Craig 
were West Virginias All American 
Mark Workman; Duquesnes Jim 
Tucker; Jesse Arnella, freshman 
phenomemon at Penn State; and 
Joe Richards of W&J. Richards 
needed a 34 point splurge in his 
final outing to close with a mere 
two point edge over Tom. *
All Star Team
Craigs value to the Cratsleymen this year was not due to his 
prolific scoring ability alone. His 
staunch work in the pivot and on 
defense were important factors in 
leading the Tartans to their best 
record in over fifteen years. His 
increased all-around ability was 
no doubt an important item in his 
selection to the Tri-State All Star 
team. () |j
In addition to his point total 
this year, Craig racked up 155 
points as a freshman and added 
232 last year to give him a three 
year* total of 785 points. This 
leaves him just 274 points behind 
Mike Theodores all time school 
record of -1059 scored over a four 
year playing period.
Record Setter
By this time next year it is al- R 
most certain that Craig will havOf 
the local statisticians busy bring
ing the Skibo record book up to 
date. Tom has already broken 
Theodores one season high of 324 
points and next year his sights will 
be trained on Mel Cratsleys one 
game high of 34 points set in 1938 
against West Virginia plus Theo
dores over-all scoring record.
Coach Cratsley is hoping for 
another fine record next year as he ^ 
loses only two lettermen throughgraduation. If Tom Craig con- I 
tinues to improve as he has in the I 
past, Mels wishes may well turn I 
into reality. I
Remember Polanski, one more foul on you and yer out!
Overend Honored 
At Carnegie Clan 
Lunch Thursday
Buddy Overend, retiring ath
letic director, was lauded by his 
closest friends Thursday, as he 
was guest of honor at the weekly 
luncheon of the Pittsburgh Car
negie Clan. More than eighty peo
ple, one of the clan meetings larg
est crowds, turned out to pay their 
respects to Buddy.
Among those speaking a word 
in Buddys favor were Jack Henry 
and Carl Hughes, sports writers 
from the Sun-Telegraph and 
Press, Tom Hamilton, athletic di
rector at Pitt, President J. C. 
Warner, Carnegie All-American 
Howard Harpster, and coaches 
Guy Halferty and Eddie Baker.
Several voiced the opinion that 
Mr. Overend should be retained 
as athletic director at Carnegie 
despite the automatic retirement 
rule in effect. The appointment of 
a new director has not yet been 
announced.

The following is an opinion on the goals and functions of a col
lege publication, together with how these goals and functions are be
ing frustrated on the Carnegie campus. We point out, however, that 
these views do not necessarily reflect the opinions of all members of 
Pi Delta Epsilon, or even of a majority of the honorarys members. 
Only one of the signers of the statement below is now a member of 
PiDE.
See Engineering Hall, 
Building of Wonders
EH Is Laden With Physicists, Chemists,
Dramats, And Silly Pineapple-Like Things
By Dick Durstine
It is indeed curious what can be observed in so staid and re
spectable place as Engineering Hall, stronghold of the physical sci
ences, stunted partner of the stringy AH-PH combination.
But from the very first glance, the building is a source of un
ending amazement to all who use^--------------------------------------------------------
it.
On viewing the structure from 
the Forbes street side, one is as
tounded by its ---x- - -- nil i  in
From anv^ other 
wonder whether
such a small ^ jjiM 
worth bothering W-C'
with in the first ^ \
place, except as
a storehouse for  %
w e i ghtless Durstine 
cords, perfect
springs, frictionless surfaces, and 
ideal gases for use in the science 
departments.
Which Floor Is First?
In reality, however, EH is a 
good sized aggregation of cement, 
steel, brick, and those silly things 
that look like pineapples, and rest 
at the foot at each flight of stairs. 
No-one is quite sure how many 
floors are either above or below 
the first. In fact, there has been 
considerable debate as to which is 
the first floor.
Despite its misleading name, the 
heart of Engineering Hall is its 
doors. Newest of these is the new 
opening added to the physics wing 
this winter. Upon the discovery 
of this aperture, six electronics 
experts who for 17 years had been 
sealed up and were living on the 
few grubs and lizards they could 
catch, came forth again into the 
world.
Push and Pull
Perhaps the most curious pair 
of entrances, are the two that are 
located at the foot of the steps 
leading from the so-called Senior 
Walk. Of these, the one marked
push is equipped with a doornob, and the one which we are 
directed to pull is completely 
blank; smooth and unprofaned. 
From the other side, the student 
who obeys orders to push finds 
himself stppped cold.
Recently, even the populace of 
EH has been altered by a vast im
migration of arts students come to 
do we know not what in the halls 
of scientific learning. But no mat
ter what their original motive of 
the Fine Arts students might have 
been, they too have been swal
lowed up by the ancient cave of 
EH.
New Department
On first entering the engineer
ing building, one dramat stood for 
25 minutes in the qualitative 
analysis lab before learning that 
coffee was not available. In this 
and similar cases, it has been 
proved that the arts students, just 
as the engineers, are no match for 
the complexities of EH.
Finally, the engineers and sci
entists themselves. How do they 
fare? What are their needs? The 
most obvious immediate necessity 
is a new department, one of 
pseudo-science to accommodate 
the throng of pseudo-scientists that 
file through the corridors each day. 
Much talent is being wasted in the 
legitimate science classes.
Rejoice!
This would parallel the proposed 
pseudo intellectualism courses to 
be offered by the division of 
H&SS, aimed to instruct students 
how to speak and act at cocktail 
parties and rushing functions.
Surely, the world is surging for
ward, let us rejoice. Utopia is at 
hand.
Council
[Continued from page 3]
and reported that the date of the 
spring concert has been changed 
from April 19 to May 23. The 
switch was made because conflict
ing activities had been scheduled 
for the former date.
Council approved an appropria
tion of $25 to pay for the cup to 
be awarded the winning school in 
the Carnegie Tartan Debating 
Tournament April 26. It was felt 
that the success of last years 
tournament justified Councils sup
port.
On the social side, Council gave 
its approval to April 18 as the date 
for the Beta Sigma Rho formal, 
April 19 for the Beta Theta Pi for
mal, April 26 for the Chi Omega 
formal, and March 28 for the 
sophomore dance.
Constitution Revisions
Revisions in Scimitars consti
tution pertaining to the method of 
selection of new members were 
presented by Dick Durstine and 
accepted by Council. Scimitar will 
now make two calls a year, one at 
spring carnival and the other at 
homecoming. Pledges will be 
chosen on the bases of a letter dis
cussing a school problem, a per
sonal interview, and the appli
cants activities record. Scholas
tically, they must be in the upper

Artist Balcomb Greene Receives 
National Honor From Critics
The Magistrate by Balcomb Greene, one of the countrys 
leading abstract painters and an associate professor of art at CIT, 
has been selected by the art critics of seven national publications as 
one of the 70 outstanding American paintings of the years 1900 to
1952i 4------------------------------------------------------
seum of Modern Art, the WhitneyFifty-one artists are represent
ed in the exhibition currently 
showing at the Wildenstein Gal
leries in New York.
Prof. Greene is also winner of 
this years H. J. Grinsfelder Prize 
for distinguished oil painting in 
the Associated Artists 42nd An
nual Exhibition.
Greene, who has taught history 
of art at Carnegie Tech the past 
ten years, is an artist of interna
tional reputation. He represented 
the United States in the 1949 Bienniel in Venice, Italy, and also in 
South America.
In 1948, Greene was voted Man 
of the Year in Art, by both the 
Arts and Crafts Center and the 
Junior Chamber of Commerce. He 
has been invited to show his num
erous International and U.S. paint
ing shows at Carnegie Institute. A 
versatile artist, Greene has exe
cuted murals for the New York 
Worlds Fair and the Williams
burg Housing Project (N.Y.), as 
well as designing a stained glass 
window for the Bronx High School 
of Science.
The artists work hangs in the 
permanent collections of the MuMuseum, the Walker Art Center, 
the Guggenheim Museum of NonObjective Art, and the University 
of Nebraska. He has had three 
one-man shows in New York. His 
latest exhibition in 1950 at Bertha 
Schaefer Gallery (N.Y.) was se
lected by Art News magazine as 
one of the ten best shows of that 
year. At present, he is preparing 
another one-man show to open at 
the Bertha Schaefer Gallery on 
April 14.
Balcomb Greene divides his 
time now between Pittsburgh and 
a contemporary home which he 
has built himself at Montauk 
Point, Long Island. When Greene 
isnt painting, teaching, building, 
or writing articles on art, he 
spend his leisure time experi
menting with photography.
Birdmen
Sky-Bos, Carnegie Techs 
flying club, has started a se
ries of CAA visual-education 
films on primary flight train
ing. These movies are shown 
every other Tuesday at 11:30 
a.m. in Porter Hall 331.
The publications honorary fraternity, Pi Delta Epsilon, has de
cided:
 1. The Tartan is not read.
2. The Scot is in the red.
3. The Thistle is in a rut.
4. The Technical is in a stria.
THEN WHY PUBLICATIONS AT ALL????
1. The function of a school publication is to maintain, encour
age, and foster student interest in the school and its activities.
2. Publications serve as a means of communicating student ex
pression, student belief, and student aims.
3. Publications serve an educational function: to gel, coordinate,
and encourage student thought in local, national, and international 
issues by stimulating discussion and opinion.
4. Through both serious and witty creation, true publications
serve as a vent for student talent.
5. Petitions must entice interest in the school they are serving.
6. Publications precipitate and catalize student action in school 
and local problems to promote social responsibility in the individual 
for the betterment of the community and the school.
PI DELTA EPSILON RECOGNIZES THE FAILURE OF OUR 
PUBLICATIONS TO FULFILL THESE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE:
1. A vague and undefined administration policy in regard to the 
material and subject matter permitted in the publications.
2. The present situation of the publications does not stimulate' 
interest and participation in these publications among the students, 
alumni, and friends.
3. The unique accounting system originated by those in control 
makes it utterly impossible to determine the financial situation of the 
individual publications, to utilize profits for the betterment of the 
publications, and ties the hands of the publications to the adminis
tration.
4. This malignant situation discourages student participation and 
interest in publications and allied activities.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT????

Seconds after a telephone alert to a nearby 
Air Force base to scramble, pilots hustle 
to their jets. In minutes, the stubby, sweptback interceptors thunder skyward.
This is the real thing. Pilots call it a hot 
scramble. Live ammo rides in their guns. 
It starts when an Air Force radar station 
detects air aircraft which cannot be identi
fied. A telephone call by direct wire gal
vanizes the jet crews into action.
Modern air defense requires lightning-fast, 
dependable communication. Thats why 
our radar defense system is interlinked by 
a web of direct telephone lines.
Some of todays college graduates will be 
piloting Air Force jets. Others will be wel
comed into the Bell System where they can 
help, in peace or war, in the tremendous 
job of meeting the communications needs 
of our nation.

Professor Paape Tells Why 
Many Communists Quit Party
By Bill Smith
Ask anybody if he has troubles and hell probably say, I got 
troubles I aint used yetwhy just look at the mess the world is
in, just look what those Commies 
ears have been bent listening to 
perialism, Communism, etc. to lit-1 
tie benefit.
The Tartan visited Mr. Charles 
W. Paape of the History Depart
ment to ask him the question he 
has used for several speeches, 
Why do people leave the Com
munist Party? The answer can 
be found in the writings of those 
who left the Communist ranks 
Elizabeth Bentley, Victor Krav
chenko, Arthur Koestler, and oth
ers.
Foresee Weaknesses
The great weaknesses of great 
movements that have failed 
throughout history can be forseen 
at the beginning and in the move
ment itself. The soft spots of Com
munism, then, should be plain to 
see if the evidence is analyzed 
correctly.
Two big points against Com
munism are: individualism is de
stroyed and facts are overlooked. 
Personality is gradually ruined by 
greater and greater demands on 
the individual. There is no lati
tude in the system, everyone is 
pressed into a mould and is de
nied his own expression. The oth
er glaring flaw is that facts are
are doing, just... A great many 
screams about war, Russian Imoverlooked. The big wigs put their 
heads together, decide on some
thing, and call it fact. These blind 
facts are sometimes quite wrong.
About Face
Those who abandon the Com
munist doctrine often about face 
and switch their allegiance to 
religion, usually the Catholic 
Church. The fact that they change 
their group doesnt exactly mean 
that they have really thought 
through the situation for them
selves. The Church offers those 
things suppressed by the Com
munists, so the person simply 
reverses himself without much 
attempt to realize the entire sit
uation.
The soft spots in the Communist 
doctrine are what we must attack 
if we are to undermine the sys
tem. The weaknesses presented 
above as found by Mr. Paape, us
ing the famous Soc Rel method 
of thinking, are the ones he be
lieves most likely to cause the j 
eventual breakdown of the sys
tema breakdown that can be 
hastened by a little push on the 
part of the United States.

In a cigarette, taste 
makes the difference 
and Luckies taste better!
The difference between just smoking and 
really enjoying your smoke is the taste of a 
cigarette. You can taste the difference in the 
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a 
Lucky . . . for two important reasons. First, 
L.S./M.F.T.Lucky Strike means fine tobacco 
... fine, mild tobacco that tastes better. Second, 
Luckies are made to taste better... proved bestmade of all five principal brands. So reach for a 
Lucky. Enjoy the cigarette that tastes better!
