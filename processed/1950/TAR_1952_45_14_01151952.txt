Bill Stewart 
Elected New 
CFP President
CFP has elected Bill Stewart, 
its former secretary, as it new 
president for the spring semester. 
Stewart, a member of Sigma Al
pha Epsilon fraternity, under
took past president Bill Hldsons 
responsibilities on January 7.
Councils new president also 
takes an active part in other cam

Bill Stewart
New CFP President
Other officers include Bruce 
Updike, co-chairman of Greek 
Sing, who was re-elected vicepresident; A1 DeVido, secretary; 
and Wes Apple, treasurer.
No important changes are to be 
made in CFP, according to Stew
art. Present plans for the spring 
semester will see a continuation of 
Hudsons reorganization of the so
cial rules into a more workable 
order. CFP intends to do this by 
comparing its action with those of 
other interfraternity organizations 
in the National Fraternity Coun
cil, to which the Council sends 
representatives.

Council Suspends Constitutions 
To Enforce Traditions Rules
Cameron Choir, WRCT, And Scotch 'n Soda
Operating With Frosh Who Failed Exam
Student Council; in following up its program of strict enforce
ment of freshman regulations, has suspended the constitutions of 
three major campus organizations, Cameron Choir, WRCT, and 
Scotch n Soda. To qualify for reinstatement of their constitutions, 
these organizations must submit a4---------------------------------------------------------
list of their freshman members 
and must also, upon the request 
of Council, drop any freshmen 
who have not passed the traditions 
exam.
In an effort to stimulate greater 
student interest in the forthcom
ing SC election, Council changed 
the date of the election from Feb
ruary 5 to February 6. This will 
give candidates an extra day of 
campaigning and will allow pre
liminary coverage of the campaign 
in the Tartan.
A motion by Bob Byrne, which 
would put the freshman Tradi
tions Exam in the form of a ques
tionnaire in the future, was de
feated. It was felt that the ques
tionnaire would be too easy and 
thus would not serve its purpose.
Certain revisions in the ByLaws, concerning the functions 
and organization of the social and 
freshman regulations committees 
of Student Council, were also 
made. However, a plan to draw up 
a rigid social calendar in the 
spring of each year for the follow
ing year was turned down. Al
though this plan might have elim
inated some conflict of social 
functions, Council felt that it 
would be too difficult to plan many 
of the events that far in advance.
Irv Shechter advanced a plan 
to hold all football pep rallies on
Choir
 All members, as well as 
those interested in joining the 
Cameron Choir, are to sign up 
for voice classifications and 
try-outs at the end of the reg
istration line. These will be 
held during the first week of 
the new semester.
National IF Council 
Supports fcGreek W eek
The growing importance of Greek Week in fraternity public 
relations and the benefits of a delayed rushing system were stressed 
again at the recent National Interfraternity Conference held in Old 
Point Comfort, Virginia. ?
Carnegie delegate Gary Recker, 
in a report to CFP, outlined the 
discussion which pointed up the 
many possibilities and advantages 
which could develop if fraterni
ties would process pledges to the 
point of the usual Hell Week (and 
then) turn to a constructive week 
of activities worthy acclaim. 
Besides eliminating the harm
ful practices of Hell Week, such a 
program, according to the report, 
would promote better understand
ing and interaction between the 
fraternities, discover and develop 
leadership within the fraternities, 
^and give fraternities the opporliJPHunity to engage in collectivei
 community service. Competition 
between pledge classes, open 
houses for parents, and a combin
ed dance on Saturday night were
also cited as possible activities for 
Greek Week.
Rushing Discussed 
Continuing, the report describ
ed the discussions on rusing, of 
great interest now that the draft 
and the manpower shortage are 
beginning to be felt on campuses. 
General conclusions were that the 
local IF Council should contact 
all men before rushing begins, 
that the fewer regulations the bet
ter (because of the difficulties of 
enforcementeven with a strong 
disciplinary body), and that fra
ternity scholarship at schools em
ploying delayed rushing was con
sistently above the all mens 
averages.
Should Be Self-Supporting 
Other important discussions 
were held on the proper duties 
and organization of the local IF

uGood Heavens Has Prevue
Scotch n Soda members were treated to a preview of Good 
Heavens, this years musical, and a review of last years show at 
the clubs annual prevue held at the Carnegie Inn January 13.
Good Heavens is the story of a star which shines above 
Machinery Hall. This star decides*
Friday afternoons rather than in 
the evenings. The advantages of 
this change, according to Shechter, 
would be that more students 
would be able to attend, the foot
ball team would be able to take 
part, and there would be no con
flict with Friday night social 
events. The plan was not approv
ed on the ground that those in 
charge of the rallies should be 
free to determine the nature of 
each rally according to the exist
ing circumstances.

NYU Investigation
With graduation fast approach
ing, senior engineers can look for
ward to starting salaries approxi
mately 16 per cent higher than a 
year ago. So says a recent survey 
conducted by New York Univer
sity.
Average starting salaries have 
risen from lows of $227 in 1947 
and $252 in 1948 to todays high of 
$301. Biggest increases have come, 
according to the survey, in indus
trial and chemical engineering, 
with civil and mechanical not far 
behind. A complete breakdown

which is being written by Peggy

Editorials
Why Bother?
Heard in Skibo: Why should anybody waste all that 
energy talking about Student Council? So theyre inefficient 
and foul up their own electionthey dont have much to do 
anyway except grumble a little before they approve what 
the Administration wants done.
Well, why waste the energy? All the energy that could 
otherwise be used to solve that all-important integral or play 
another game of bridge. All that energy that could be used 
in those bull sessions -about the condition of the barracks 
or the decline in the number of worthwhile campus activi
ties and social events. Why bother to vote when there are 
only enough candidates to fill the vacancies anyway?
At the present time, admittedly, Council doesnt appear 
to be doing much for the students. Too much time is spent 
by too many people wrangling over By-Laws that arent 
even clear to Council itself, or in trying to remedy past 
shortcomings that should never have occurred in an organi
zation supposedly composed of the clearest thinkers on 
campus.
But even the most unconcerned students will admit 
that there are things at Carnegie Tech which they would like 
to see changedperhaps changes which the Administration, 
rightly or wrongly, would oppose. Then what method can 
students use to put force behind their wants? The answer 
is a Student Council which really is composed of the ablest 
people on campus instead of the type we appear to have at 
present. A Council which recognizes that the school exists 
for the students and that student opinion is a powerful force 
for action, a Council which is willing to accept the respon
sibilities of efficiency and straight thinking which are the 
responsibilities of a powerful organization. And the only 
way students can get such a Council is to get people to run 
who can do the job, and then elect them.
The present case of illegalor lets call it extra-legal 
to be politeelection procedure (see Letters elsewhere 
on this page) was not brought about because one engineer 
wanted to perpetuate himself in office. Rather, it developed 
because some few people began to realize that unless this 
extra-legal action was taken there might be no one on Coun
cil next semester who could function effectively as the presi
dent of Council. Though the reason does not justify the ir
regularities, it serves to point up the crying need for better 
Council representation.
Wednesday, February 6, is the date of the new Council 
election. In an effort to secure a better, more responsible 
student government, the Tartan will put out a special issue 
on the Tuesday before the election. All candidates are urged 
to submit to the Tartan before Friday, February 1, their 
answers to the following questions:
1. Why are you running for Student Council?
2. What SPECIFICALLY do you intend to try to accomp
lish if elected?
Answers should be typewritten, triple spaced, and should 
not exceed 200 words. Please be specific in your answers!
Candidates answers, plus their other qualifications and 
activities, will be listed, together with the Tartans personal 
opinion on those who should form the next Council.
If it is worthwhile trying to correct campus conditions, 
then it is worthwhile working for a good Student Council. 
We believe that the key to the revival of student spirit and 
interest is in the election of an efficient and imaginative 
Student Councila Council which should begin to take 
shape at the next election.

THE RECKONING APPROACHETH
The God That Failed
By Deek di Salvo
Rabbi Freehof once said, Our generation is the product of the 
seepage from Darwinism, Marxian Socialism, and philosophical 
science. These stones of thought were thrown into the pool of 
Victorian prudity and* the ripples became a tidal wave that beat 
down 5,000 years of the Judo-4---------------------------------------------------------
Christian tradition. Perhaps some 
will say that a college paper is not 
the place to discuss our heritage 
of confusion; many will condemn 
a beginner in the field of learning 
for expression about the facets of 
our age of anxiety, but I feel that 
college men and women must dis
cuss our moral, social, and scien
tific failures; I feel our generation 
must not accept nor imitateit 
must create, if the failure of con
cepts of the last century are not 
to become the destruction of this 
century.
The God That Failed
Where do we, the products of 
the last hundred years, find our
selves? Where do we, the appren
tices in an institution whose as
sembly line is directed in the sus
taining of the scientific order, find 
ourselves? The shank end of the 
last century gave birth to a popu
lar dietyagnostic science. The 
angel choirs of atheism sang, 
Hope is just around the corner; 
abundance and peace for all; new 
freedom from the dregs of fear 
that shackled religion to the heart 
of man. Is there peace? Is there 
hope? Is there freedom? The new 
doctrines smiled at the medieval 
man and his notion that his soul 
was the eternal breath of God, for 
science proved God was not eter
nalHe was bounded by the end
ing in the atom and limits of space 
bending back upon itself. The 
endless chain was ended! Mans 
sum-total was animalDarwinism 
proved it! The horns of science 
blew and the spiritual body of 
man that touched eternity col
lapsed; in its place stood puny 
man whose end was fertilization 
of the soil and whose appetites 
aid aims were now only for ma
terial gain. But the hope of the 
last centurythe hope that man 
once freed from spiritual morality 
would attain new heightshas 
turned to the curse of this cen
tury!
Survival of the Strongest
Modem man, I think, is well 
aware that science for its own sake 
and its disciple, atheistic material
ism, have given birth only to new 
and better ways for race destruc
tionbrutal dictatorship, and a 
return to the survival of the
strongest. No one can deny the 
infinite betterments of science, but 
who can deny that science without 
a spiritual master is the monster 
of our times? The hope that en
lightenment without reliance on 
God would produce a better world 
is nothing but a false illusion, for 
man isand always will beman! 
What greater proof need we than 
the results of two social experi
ments with a base of atheistic ma
terialism and non-spiritual science 
Nazism and Communism? What 
greater example is there that 
minds without spiritual responsi
bility and pledged only to the 
cause of science are a threat to 
human existence than Klaus 
Fuchs? Here we have a man giv
ing to other men of science the se
crets of atomic energygiving to 
men of amoral concepts the tools 
of immoral destruction.
Need Common Base  
Without a common moral and 
spiritual basis, science, like na
tions, cannot build a world of 
peacefor peace must rest on the 
absolute of truth and mans sub
mission to it. Without a moral and 
spiritual common denominator, 
man will never know peace ac
cept through preparation for war 
and domination through force; thus 
science for its own sake and man 
as a nonspiritual master of his 
destiny are gods that cannot but 
fail.
Letters
Lynch Attacks 
Plan To Fill 
SC Vacancy
Editor, the Tartan:
It is an embarrassing position in 
which Student Council now finds 
itself. Possibly to avoid further 
embarrassment and explaining, 
the complete report of Councils 
fumbling in the recent election has 
not yet reached the student body. 
Perhaps inside influence on the 
Tartan staff is responsible or else 
it is the inability of the student 
reporter to report the news.
The student (only a handful), 
who reluctantly went to the polls 
to vote, did not question the ap
pearance of the ballots, nor did 
they question the appearance of a 
lone engineers name to fill a Fine 
Arts vacancy for one semester. 
Not only was this in itself a viola
tion of the Student Council Con
stitution and by-laws, but also a 
mention of this available vacancy 
was made in the Tartan.
These facts were or should have 
been known by the Executive 
Committee of SC, which was fa
miliar with the fact that the sup
posed candidates name was on 
the ballot. The executive commit
tee also contains a faculty repre
sentative. Thus not only Council 
but also the administration was to 
blame for this malversation.
It has been suggested that the 
executive committees aim was to 
provide a likely candidate for 
the presidency of SC during the 
next semester. The lone engineer, 
who appeared as a Fine Arts can
didate, now serves as an engineer
ing representative on Council. His 
present term expires with toe 
coming elections. Is there a short
age of competent men on council, 
or is the administration looking 
for their own type of leaders to 
guide student activities? This 
question and many others regard
ing the bungling of Council may 
only be answered by the students 
at the polls.
Sincerely Yours,
Robert D. Lynch.

C-Book Popular With 
Patrons of Literature
Art Exhibitions
Next Semester
Rosenwald Collection
At Banquet
By Dick Durstine
Booklovers who like to sink their teeth into something that 
states the facts without beating about the bush, and who are willing 
to sacrifice literafy style for love of knoweldge, should take a look 
at the Carnegie Student Directory.
More convenient to handle and*
of greater current interest than 
either the Handbook of Chemistry 
and Physics or Websters New In
ternational Dictionary, the C-Book 
is a must for the well informed 
student.
27 Smiths
Embracing 52 pages, plus a 
sturdy paper cover that is pro
vided at no extra cost, the direc
tory lists approximately 2876 
names plus the principal officers 
of some 66 campus student organ
izations. It is therefore a must for 
anyone who likes to see his name 
in print.
If the person mentioned above is 
named Smith, he is in luck, for 
there are 27 Smiths, plus three 
Schmitts, a Schmid, and a Smit, 
all there for the asking. Running 
a poor second are the Andersons, 
with 11, followed by 10 Mitchells. 
Other cognomens, from Aarons to
Zurowski, appear in numbers 
varying from one to nine.
Try the Phone Book 
Persons with names such as 
Bratkowsky, Cejrowski, Dumbrowski, and Dunn are not so for
tunate as the Smiths. Only one 
each of these appear.
If your name happens to be 
Iannacchione, Lukasiewicz, or 
Moris, you should try the Pitts
burgh Telephone Directory, which 
contains a more complete listing of 
names than the C-Book.
Added Features 
In length, the Carnegie direc
torys contents range from names 
the size of Freialdenhofen, Mandamadiotis, and Schaltenbrand to 
Hu, Li, and Ng.
All told, the C-Book is a treas
ury of facts and entertaining read
ing. And for those who tire of art 
for arts sake, and wish to call 
their girls (or men, as the case 
may be), it contains a fine collec 
tion of phone numbers.
Now On Display
Carnegie Institutes Department 
of Fine Arts has a series of five 
special art exhibitions scheduled 
for the next four months.
First in the series is a showing 
of Modern French prints from the 
Lessing J. Rosenwald collection, 
usually displayed in the National 
Gallery of Art. This exhibition, 
which is now on the balcony of 
the Hall of Sculpture in the Car
negie Museum, will last till Feb
ruary.
Flower Prints, original botanical 
drawings in color-plate books 
from the collection of Mrs. Roy 
Arthur Hunt, is another exhibi
tion which is currently in pro
gress. On February 17, this dis
play, now placed in Galleries E. 
F, G, and H, in the Institute, will 
end.
Forthcoming exhibits include 
the 42nd Annual Exhibition of 
the Associated Artists of Pitts
burgh; prints by Georges Rouault, 
Misery and War; and photo
graphs by Luke Swank, all of 
which will begin in February and 
end in March.

Speaks On Draft
Chief speaker at the Conference 
was Colonel D. A. Omer, of the 
general council of the Selective 
Service System. When questioned 
as to how college students can 
plan their education with any cer
tainty, Omer did not answer di
rectly but did say that at present 
only 50,000 men a month are 
available for the armed forces un
less veterans, students, 4-Fs, or 
those now over age or with de
pendents are reclassified. Which 
of the now-deferred groups will 
get hit first in the event draft calls 
average over 50,000 a month is 
largely a matter of public opinion, 
concluded Omer, as he advised: 
Let each man always conduct 
himself on and off campus so that 
parents of men in service can un
derstand and be sympathetic with 
the wisdom of our student defer
ment.
The draft call for February u?as 
considerably over 50,000 men, 
while that for March is slightly 
under the same figure, mainly be
cause of shortages of housing and 
facilities for new recruits.
Maryland Wins
The report went cm to give the 
various awards presented at the 
conference. Maryland won the 
award for the best Interfratemity 
Council in the country, as well as 
that for a large rural school. Stev
ens won the award for the best 
Council in a small urban school, 
while Hanover took honors in a 
small rural school division. Ohio 
State was tops in the large urban 
school class. With the dividing 
line between large and small 
set at 5,000 students, Carnegie was 
classed as a small urban school.

Carnegie Hoopsters In Foul Slu

Geneva, Penn State 
Increase Loss String
Tartans Upset By Co vies 72-64;
74-56 Victims Of Nittany Lions
Carnegie Techs Tartans ran their loss streak on the hardwood to 
five straight this week as they dropped a 72-68 thriller-diller to 
Geneva at Skibo Gym Wednesday and were swamped 74-56 Saturday
at Penn State. ?----------------------------------------------------------

proclivity to foul and their ina
bility to connect at the charity 
line provided the basis for an up
set by Geneva in their second en
gagement. The Plaid whipped 
the Covies earlier in tho year by 
a 69-55 margin.
Fouls Hurt 
Outscoring the Covies 56-42 
from the field, the Skibos were 
able to cash only 12 free throws 
while the Geneva lads were mer
rily adding 30 from the 35 per
sonal violations committed by the 
Plaid. The personals hurt the Kil
ties in more ways than one as five 
members of the varsity ten man
aged to leave the game via the 
five-foul route.
Led by their big center John 
Galagaza, who missed the first 
Carnegie-Geneva engagement, the 
Covies led all the way. At one 
time early in the second quarter, 
they built up a 31-13 lead as the 
Plaid committed every basketball 
error in the book. Just before the 
half, the Tartans finally caught 
fire to draw up at 41-33 at the in
termission.
After the half the parade of 
players leaving the game began 
with Hilary Holste first, but the 
Skibos still managed to pull up at 
54-55 as the third quarter ended.
Tie Score 
In the final minutes of the 
game the Tartans did tie the score 
at 66-all but fouls hurt them 
again. Taking the lead on a free 
throw by Pete Kinkaid, the Cov
ies added another point on Tom 
Craigs fifth personal as he at
tempted to shoot. From there on in 
it was all Geneva as the Plaid lost 
its poise and collapsed entirely.
Saturdays engagement saw the 
Skibos hold favored Penn State 
to a modest 35-28 margin at halftime, but fold in the second canto 
to lose 74-56.
Beck Shines 
Accurate shooting by Tommy 
Beck kept the Tartans in the 
game in the first half, when he 
garnered most of his points. The 
Skibos hit a better percentage of 
their shots from the field than 
Penn State, connecting on 15 in 
46 tries, but the Lions shot more 
often, scoring on 29 of 101.
Failure at the free throw line 
again hurt the Plaid, which scor
ed on only 26 of 48 trie^ for a 
.542 percentage. On the brighter 
side the Tartans were not quite as 
flagrant in the fouling department 
as usual, committing only 29 vio
lations against Wednesdays high 
of 35.
High scorer for the evening was 
Penn States Jesse Arnell who 
collected 23 points on nine field 
goals and five fouls. The Skibos 
were led by Tom Craig with 15 
and Hila-v Holste, who had 14.
Prospects Dim 
At their present rate the Tar
tans b;d to make it eight straight 
losses, with not much relief in 
immediate sight for the hapless 
Skibos. The schedule calls for 
Pitt. Case Tech, and W&J as their 
next three opponents. All three 
have compilea respectable records 
in early season play and figure 
ahead of the Tartans on paper.
Pitt, the Tartans traditional 
rival and their next opponent at 
the Skibo gym, will brinj, a 5-4 
record with them when they meet 
CIT this Wednesday in their an
nual content. Although not an extra-impressive record, the Pan
thers slate includes a telling win 
over top-ranked Syracuse.
TOM CRAIGBILL FARBACHER
Shown above are Tom Craig and Bill Farbacher currently 
first and third in the basketball scoring pUrade for Carnegie. 
Craig with 131 points is leading his teammates in the floor sport 
after putting in a good performance on the gridiron this fall. 
Farbacher with 106 points has been playing his usual steady, 
dependable game. Behind Craig in second place in scoring is 
Hilary Holste with 108 points while Bub Kuenzig, only other 
Tartan to score more than 100 points, is in fourth place with 
101 points.
Varsity C Will

Plaid Mermen Down Allegheny 
Natators 49-35 In Skibo Pool
Nick Demas and Dick Kramer starred as the Tartan Mermen 
drowned Allegheny 49-35 in the Skibo pool Saturday.
Allegheny won the opening event, the medley relay, but the 
Tartans bounced back to take the other events in the first half of 
the meet. Kramer took the 220 ?- 
yard freestyle. Demas the 50 yard 
freestyle, and Bob Weddell the 150 
yard individual medley to make 
it a tie meet at the start of the 
diving.
Show Power
At this point the Tartans showed 
their power as Grey Duncan and 
Rod Anderson took first and sec
ond place to give the Skibos a lead 
they never lost. Demas took the 
100 yard freestyle in the very good 
time of 55.5 to give him a double 
win, but Bob Coulter was defeated 
by Schenck of the Gators in the 
backstroke.
It was at this point that Alle
gheny made its big bid for a win 
as it swept all three positions in 
the backstroke. Coach Claude 
Sofield countered by putting Kra
mer in the 440 and the strategy
worked as Phil Drew and Kramer 
came in first and second to give 
the Tartans a total of 42 points to 
39 for Allegheny.
Win Relay 
With the relay left to swim, the 
Tartans were insured of a tie and 
needed a first to win the meet. 
Weddell led off for the Plaid and 
picked up half a pool length lead 
which Dave Chidester, Kramer, 
and Demas held to the end.
The win gave the Tartans a 
double victory, since Allegheny 
was a previous victor over Grove 
City, the only team to upset Car
negie this year.
The Plaid Mermen now hold a 
record of two wins and one loss. 
Their next meet will be held'this 
Wednesday in the Skibo pool

Playhouse Comedy 
Set To Open 
On January 19
The next Pittsburgh Playhouse 
production, Twentieth Century, 
the riotous comedy by Ben Hecht 
and Charles MacArthur, will open 
on January 19.
As the name of the play sug
gests, the action takes place 
aboard the Twentieth Century 
Limited between Chicago and New 
York.
A flat-broke producer, return
ing from a flop in Chicago, meets 
an ex-flame and reigning movie 
queen in the drawing-room next 
to his. It is obvious that if he can 
get her name on a contract, his 
financial difficulties will be over.
The current Playhouse produc
tion Present Laughter winds up 
on Saturday.

Miami Professor Investigates 
Lower Classmens Differences
Before he (or she) is metamorphosed into a junior or senior and 
goes to sit amongst the gods, every student passes through a period 
of being a freshman and then a sophomore.
While to the upperclassmen, these groups are merely two separate 
forms of loam, there is a profound# 
difference between the freshman
and the sophbmore, a fact which 
is realized by the sophomores, if 
by no-one else. Arthur G. Phil
lips, an English professor at the 
University of Miami, Florida, has 
outlined these differences for the 
Miami Hurricane, from whence 
they have been stolen for use in 
the Tartan.
1. Freshmen believe that all 
their professors are smart; soph
omores believe that one or two 
of their professors are smart, the 
ones that give them As.
2. Freshmen are in college to 
get an education; sophomores 
are in college because their 
fathers refuse to pay their fare 
to Las Vegas.
3. Freshmen arent dry behind 
the ears; sophomores are always 
dry.
4. A freshman will take a
wooden nickel; a sophomore will

One of the feature articles of 
this issue will be Homegeneous

temperatures below the freezing 
point without the addition of a 
crystal as a nucleus.
The issue will also include a 
story on the History of Electric 
Lighting and its effect on Amer
ican Life. A Description and 
Procedure for People Who Think

article entitled Model 2-B Regrettor.

take a wooden nickel too, and 
five minutes later put it in the 
slot machine.
5. Freshmen write home once 
a week; sophomores write when
ever theyre broke.
6. A male freshman is looking 
for a girl like his mother; this 
is also true of the sophomore, if 
his mother happens to be Jane 
Russell.
7. A Freshman believes the 
way to get good grades is to 
study hard; the sophomore has 
decided that a better way is to 
sit next to someone who studies 
hard.
8. A freshmans ambition is to 
get innto Whos Who; a soph
omore just wants to get called 
before the Kefauver Committee.
9. Freshmen suspect that pro
fessors arent human; Sopho
mores know it.
10. Freshmen kiss their dates 
good-bye; sophomores kiss them 
hello.
Now no doubt the good pro
fessor is a bit bitter for some rea
son, for we all know that these 
things could not be in the least bit 
true. Perhaps* the reason is, as 
Professor Phillips says, Every
body loves a freshman. What 
makes life so disillusioning is the 
thought that this years freshmen 
will be next years sophomores.
