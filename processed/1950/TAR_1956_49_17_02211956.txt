Antony And Cleopatra 
Dramas Best Of Year
By Barbara Conan
Rumor has it that the fourth production of the drama depart
ment, Shakespeares Antony and Cleopatra, is going to be the high 
point of what has already proven an exciting and experimental year.
Peter Bucknell, visiting director from England brings to his
direction not only the entire Eng-#------------------------------------------------------
lish tradition of Shakespeare, but
*femany vital and dynamic ideas of 
his own. His production is Eliza
bethan where honesty demands it 
and timeless where the essence of 
the play is universality.
The set, designed by Lloyd Bur
lingame, also follows the essential 
demands of the play and gets the 
best of two worlds of theatre. 
There is only one set, with various 
acting areas (i.e. an inner above, 
an inner below, and a large apron 
tage) which facilitate oid move
ment from scene to scene. Al
though this arrangement is basic
ally Elizabethan, it contains none 
of the rigid limitations which 
Shakespeare and his contemporar
ies had to combat in staging their 
plays. The very exciting costumes 
designed by Michael Pollock, Bar
bara Schultz, Sue Spector, and 
Don Gibson avoid the restrictions 
of Elizabethan clothing and sug
gest the essence of time, place, and 
character.
Exciting: Theatre 
Although this production may 
not be Elizabethan enough for the 
ideals of the purists, or radical 
enough for the ideals of the mod
erns, to the n.ajority of us, who 
stand somewhere in between, it is 
certainly exciting and dynamic 
theatre.
Heading the cast are Sally Bresdn and Claude Jenkins as the 
middle-aged lovers of the title, 
and it is already evident that their 
performances are going to be ex
traordinary. Octavius Caesar will 
be played by James Golds wig, and 
completing the triumvirate, Lepidus will be played by Richard 
Brown. Charles Walsh will be

Geneva Success
The same day the basketball 
team played Geneva in Beaver 
Falls, the debate club sent a team 
to that town to participate in the 
Geneva College Debate Tourna
ment. Results were more than 
favorable. The Tech team won five 
out of a possible six debates. Two 
yjieam members, negative Jack Bel

E&S Dean Teare 
Speaks Tonight 
At Tech Forum
Dean B. Richard Teare, Jr. of 
the College of Engineering and 
Science will be the guest speaker 
tonight in the lecture series spon
sored by the Tech Community 
Forum. Beginning at 7:00 p.m. in 
100 PH, Dean Teare will present 
the topic Problems and Trends 
in Engineering Educafion.
Since industry and business 
corporations need such a large 
supply of engineers, the training 
of men to fill these positions is of 
great importance. A good engineer 
must not only be shown the tech
nical processes of the present, he 
must also be prepared for the 
rapid technological advances of the 
future. His mechanical knowl
edge should be supplimented with 
humanistic and social studies to 
give the engineering student a 
well-rounded education. Dean 
Teare believes that engineers 
should be prepared to take grad
uate work in their major fields to 
give themselves more practice for 
their difficult jobs.
After receiving his B.S. degree 
from the University of Wisconsin, 
Dean Teare remained at this col
lege for two years to do graduate 
work in electrical engineering. 
Working in General Electrics ad
vanced engineering program con
vinced him that teaching was his 
main interest. Dean Teare com
pleted his Ph.D. at Yale where he 
was &n instructor and associate 
professor in electrical engineering. 
In 1939 he began his career at 
Tech as professor of electrical 
engineering.
Proposed Revision 
Of Government 
Leaders Subject
The third Carnegie Leaders 
Conference will be held on Friday, 
February 24, and on Saturday, 
February 25. Its purpose will be 
to review the preliminary draft 
of the suggested new plan for stu
dent government which has been 
developed by ODK and Mortar 
Board during the past several 
months.
As one of their major projects 
this fall, ODK and Mortar Board, 
with the cooperation of the ex
isting Student Council, undertook 
a study of our student government 
out of which came the decision 
that a revision of the existing gov
ernment was necessary. A co
ordinating committee and three 
major subcommittees have or
ganized and developed a proposed 
new form of government which is 
to be submitted to the present 
Council and to the student body 
for approval However, ODK and 
Mortar Board would first like to 
hear some constructive criticism 
of the tentative new plan of gov
ernment, and the third leaders 
cooference has been arranged ex
pressly for this purpose.
The meeting on Friday will be 
held in the Blue Room of Morewood Gardens from 5:00-7:30. 
Discussion of the project and the 
proposed plan will be presented. 
On Saturday morning, from 9:00- 
12:00, the Conference will recon
vene in Room 100, Porter Hall, to 
consider the proposals in both gen
eral and small discussion groups.
As this conference is of such 
vital importance to the entire 
campus, it is hoped that all lead
ers will make a special effort to 
attend. The conference is being 
planned by the junior honoraries, 
Delta Skull and Phi Tau Gamma.
WRCT To Carry 
Special Program 
On Segregation
Do all Tech students have an 
equal chance to get a job after 
graduation? Will we be free to 
choose the area of town we want 
to live in, if we have the money to 
make the down payment? Whats 
behind the riots over the admis
sion of Miss Lucy at the Uni
versity of Alabama? These and 
other questions will be discussed 
next Thursday night on a special 
program on WRCT (600 on every 
Tech dial) that is being sponsored 
by the Committee on Religious 
Activities.
A new experiment in communi
cation will carry the program from 
the WRCT studio to about 16 small 
listening groups in dormitory 
rooms and fraternity houses at 
8:30 p.m., Thursday, February 23. 
These small listening groups, after 
hearing the presentation by the 
panel of Tech students, will dis
cuss the questions ^raised and the 
facts given for another half hour. 
Then at 10:30 p.m. the panel will 
again go on the air to receive and 
discuss the questions brought to it 
by one member of each of the lis
tening groups.
The topic of the. panel presen
tation at 8:30 p.m. will be Inte[Contmued on page 8]

Student Poll Planned For Use 
In Selecting New Mortar Board
 By Carolyn Copp
For the first time this year, Mortar Board will use a poll of 
junior women as one of the bases for selecting next years members. 
Members are elected to the senior womens honorary on the basis 
of leadership, scholarship, and service. The juniors will be asked 
..........~~ " , ? to check, on a list of eligible wom
en, up to 25 whom they feel are 
worthy of membership. Similar 
ballots will be sent to faculty 
members, who will be asked to 
evaluate scholarship, and to ex
ecutive boards and faculty ad
visors of activities, who will be 
asked to evaluate service and lead
ership. In these ways Mortar 
Board hopes to get opinions from 
those who know the eligible girls 
well in a ~ number of situations, 
thus making the most conscien
tious selection possible. The polls 
will not be the sole means of se
lection. In addition, interviews 
will be held with many of the 
girls, and factor, number of ac
tivities, and offices a girl has will 
have some bearing.
Leadership, scholarship, and 
service are the criteria of selec
tion for many campus honor 
groups. Every once in a while its 
necessary to throw the terms 
around again, if only to make 
suie that they are still understood 
by everyone to have the same 
meaning.
Scholarship Defined 
Scholarship, ideally, includes a 
lot more than just the bare factor 
indicates. It includes intellectual 
curiosity, an eagerness to learn, 
and a receptive attitude that

NYU And Cameron 
Sing Wednesday
On Wednesday, February 22, the Cameron Choir will^ give a 
joint concert with the New York University Glee club. Included in 
the program will be Randall Thompsons Alleluia, the Negro spirit
ual Ride the Chariot, selections from Oklahoma!, Dream of Ol------------------------------------------------ ?wen, and Kalmanoffs Song of
Peace. The glee club will present 
several of its Welsh songs, sung 
in the original tongue in a man
ner which has brought that group 
national recognition. Under the 
joint direction of Mr. Alfred 
Greenfield and Mr. Richard Camp, 
this program promises to be a most 
enjoyable one.
High Ranking Group 
The NYU. Glee Club has had 
many claims to distinction during 
its existence since 1883. The Club 
received first place in the Nation
al Intercollegiate Glee Club con
test in 1931, and wTas the first am
ateur group to appear with -the 
New York Philharmonic Sym
phony at a regular concert. The 
Glee Club has presented concerts 
at the National Gallery of Art in 
Washington, D. C., in 1947 and in 
1952. Last spring it appeared on 
the Ed Sullivan Show. Included in 
the Clubs repertoire is Bachs B 
Minor Mass and Mozarts Great 
Mass , in C Minor.
Alfred M. Greenfield, director of 
the NYU Glee Club, is regarded 
throughout the United States as 
the pioneer of the return to per
forming the authentic version of 
Handels Messiah, using the orig
inal continuity as it was first per
formed in 1742. Mjr. Greenfield is 
also conductor of the Oratorio So
ciety of New York.
Cameron Choir Active 
Cameron Choir has been heard 
on many occasions in school 
events. During the last two years 
it has been on tour to Erie, Penn
sylvania wThere a television show 
and several concerts were given, 
has made a series of radio broad
casts, and has appeared at local 
high schools and churches. Mr. 
Camp, who directs Cameron Choir, 
is the music supervisor of the Wilkinsburg schools and the director 
of several church choirs.

Steam Pipe and Tunnel Map
The unfamiliar heavy lines on the above campus map represent 
steam pipes in the Tech heating system. Tunnels connect all the main 
buildings.* * * * * * 
Network Of Tunnels 
Burrow Through Tech
By Gene Anderson
If any Tech man is thinking of invading Morewood Gardens 
via the Tech heating system tunnels, he had better give up the idea 
unless hes prepared to do a large amount of digging. There just 
arent any tunnels leading into Morewood from any spot on 4he 
campus. --------------------------------------------------------
Have you ever wondered why 
the air above the vent across the 
street from Engineering Hall is so 
warm? Have you ever noticed that 
the snow is always melting on the 
sidewalk in front of EH? The an
swers to these questions lie in Car
negie Techs heating system.
Techs central heating plant is 
located in Machinery Hall on the 
west end of the campus. A walkthru tunnel connects this plant 
with the Gym and Margaret Mor
rison. Within this tunnel there 
are pipes carrying steam at pres
sures of 50 and 100 pounds per 
square inch, a hot-water pipe, and 
condensate ducts. The 100 pound 
pipe branches off into EH where 
the pressure is reduced. It then 
continues on to heat the Faculty 
Club and the Coal Research Lab.
The 50 pound duct leads straight 
under Fine Arts where it branches 
off into two directions. One branch 
goes directly into Skibo and SIA, 
while the other continues ahead 
until it branches into the Gym 
and MMCC. The MMCC branch 
divides into two sections, one of 
which heats the grad dorms and 
the houses on Forbes St. and the 
other heats Donner IJftll, the mens 
dorms, and the houses along the 
west side of Margaret Morrison 
St. There are condensate tanks 
located at four spots on campus 
where water collects to be re
turned to Machinery Hall. A hotwater pipe in the tunnel serves 
AH, FA, EH, and MMCC.
Electrical System
The school electrical system fol
lows much the same pattern as the 
heating system. It was installed in 
1950 at a cost of $200,000. The 
system converts a 22,000 volt cur
rent into usable AC and DC 
sources and outlets.
Extensions of the power system 
have been proposed to cross the 
cut and enter Morewood Gardens. 
It is estimated that school elec
tricity could save at least $4,000 
per year in power company bills, 
but whether or not this would off
set the cost of construction is an
other matter.
Mr. Keck, the superintendent of 
heating and maintenance, with 
offices below Porter Hall, says that
Phi Kappa Phi 
Fellowship Awards
Graduate fellowships, each

member of the society who 
wishes to apply for such a 
scholarship for the year 1956- 
1957 should obtain an applica
tion form and further infor
mation regarding the award 
from Professor Thomas E. 
Stelson, Porter Hall, 123-D. 
Application forms must be 
filled out and submitted to 
Professor Stelson not later 
than March 2, 1956.
the problem of supplying and 
power in adequate quantities to 
the school is a never-ending one. 
As difficulties arise, solutions must 
be worked out quickly and effi

History Students 
To Hear Lecture 
On American Art
For several years the CIT de
partment of history has sponsored 
a formal illustrated evening lec
ture, on some phase of the his
tory of art, as a regular part of 
instruction for its 600 freshman 
students. The purpose of this lec
ture has been to provide a com
mon extra-curricular experience 
which will enable students, with 
the help of their instructors, to 
realize that their education in 
history can be easily, and pleas
antly, continued beyond the years 
experience in classrooms.
This years lecture will be on 
Friday, February 24, at 8:00 p.m. 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. Edgar 
P. Richardson, Director of the 
Detroit Institute of Arts and ed
itor of The Art Quarterly, will 
speak on The Dream of An
tiquity. His talk deals with a 
chapter in our intellectual history 
now little known and half forgot
ten; yet it its time the Dream of 
Antiquity cast a spell upon the 
American mind that we can hardly 
conceive of. It assumed many as
pects, some inspiring and heroic, 
some quaint or even ludicrous.
Early American Art
This lecture covers roughly the 
period from 1775 to 1850 and 
traces the effects of this dream 
through its varying impacts upon 
three different generations. It is
limited to painting and sculpture, 
with a few side excursions into 
literature, because the architec
tural expression of this dream 
would fill a lecture in itself.
The lecture is open to the pub
lic, partly as a community service 
but also in the hope that the 
presence of the public will cre
ate a environment dissociated from 
that of the classroom. The speaker 
is not asked to give a student 
lecture, but a scholarly lecture 
appropriate to his interests and 
for a public audience. The of
ficials of the department of fine 
arts, at the Carnegie Institute, look 
upon it as a valuable addition to 
their yearly program.
Violinist Yehudi 
Menuhin To Be 
Symphony Soloist
Yehudi Menuhin, internationally 
known American violinist, will 
appear on stage with the Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra at 
Syria Mosque this Friday night 
only, in the seventeenth concert 
of the present season! William 
Steinberg will direct the artist in 
a performance of the well-known 
concerto in D Major by Tchaikowsky, and orchestral portions of the 
concert will include the Overture 
Euryanthe by Weber, Richard 
Strauss tone poem Til Eulenspiegals Merry Pranks, and the 
World Premier performance of
Roger Goebs Symphony No. 4.
Goeb, who trained himself to be 
a chemist, has become highly ad
mired in the last ten years for his 
superior contributions to contem
porary American music. A student 
of such well known teachers as 
Nadia Boulanger of Paris and Otto 
Leuning of New York City, he h ^ 
also received degrees from New 
York University, Cleveland Insti
tute of Music, and Iowa State Uni
versity. He has recently returned 
to New York as a faculty member 
at Columbia University, and he 
resides in New Rochelle, New 
York, with his wife and their two 
children.
Menuhins Career
Yehudi Menuhin, also a young 
American with a unique bac^ 
ground, has become a legendary 
figure in music all over the world, 
and has not yet reached the age of 
forty. He first began to concertize 
at the age of nine, and in 1950 he 
celebrated his twenty-fifth anni
versary as a concert artist by 
making a world wide tour which 
included Britain, South Africa, 
New Zealand, Australia, Israel, In
dia and Japan. As a native citizen 
of the United States, Menuhin b 
sometimes been quite irked th 
his fans assume him to be of 
European background. He con 
siders himself, and rightly so, as 
an American, with an American 
background of training, and is not 
at all interested in posing as 
product of the European system, 
although he does admire European 
musicians very much.
Dave McGinnis asks:
Does Du Ront 
Have 
Summer lobs 
for College 
Students?

I)
C. David McGinnis will receive his B.S. degree in mechanical 
engineering from the University of Texas in June 1957. Currently, hes 
senior manager of mens intramural sports and a member of the 
Delta Upsilon and Phi Eta Sigma fraternities at Texas.
Ivar Lundqaard answers:
Ivar A. Lundgaard obtained two degrees, B.S. in 
Cb.E. and A.B. in economics, from the University of 
Rochester, and joined Du Ponts Photo Products plant 
at Parlin, N. J., in 1942. Later that year he became a 
shift supervisor and was promoted steadily thereafter. 
By 1951 he was Production Superintendent at Du Poets 
Rochester plant. Today Ivar is Polyester Department 
Superintendent at Parlin, well able to speak about 
Du Pont employment policies out of his own experience 
and observation.

Yes, Dave, the Du Pont Company regularly employs 
students of science and engineering in its Summer Tech
nical Training Program. The chief purpose is to provide 
good technical training under industrial conditions. And 
we learn about the students while they learn about us.
Students selected for the program after campus inter
views include candidates for the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. 
degrees. Assignments are related to their academic inter
ests. Last summer 270 students from 93 institutions 
participated in the program. In this way, ties are often 
established which can lead to permanent employment 
after graduation.
In addition, many other students are hired directly 
by individual Company units to help out during vaca
tion periods of our regular employees. For this vacation 
relief work, assignments are likely to be varied; but 
these students also gain valuable insights into industrial 
practice, and many acquire experience related to their 
fields of study. #
Altogether, about 750 college students, from both 
technical and nontechnical fields and at all levels of 
training, obtained experience with us during the summer 
of 1955. So you can readily see, Dave, that the Du Pont 
Company attaches a lot of importance to summer jobs 
for college students.

Over The
Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewe
Coming up in the next two 
weeks will be Greek Sing and 
Swing. Ive always maintained that 
Sing and Swing is the most en
joyable weekend and all-school 
function of the year. The perform
ance of the various groups and the 
anticipation of the results is 
unique. Also, the informality of the* 
dance and the emotions displayed 
by the winning and losing teams 
is something which is spontaneous 
and unrehearsed. (The Kappas 
have won Greek Sing at least four 
years in a row. And yet, when the 
winners have been announced and 
the victory number is to be sung 
on Saturday night, the Kappas 
have been so busy crying and 
kissing theyve never finished the 
song. Youd think they would be 
used to winning by now.)
To the losing teams, the emo
tions displayed by the winner are 
always a little childish and super
ficial. To the winners, the losers are 
a bunch of soreheads. As always, 
the winners will feel they own 
the campus for a few weeks, and 
the losers will make definite reso
lutions to do better next year. In 
fact, theyll even deploy certain 
brothers to find freshman tenors 
who have not been plet ?ri yet. A 
month later, when the air is fill
ed with the excitement of Spring 
Carnival, Greek Sing is far away, 
and buggy pushes ~nd campaign 
performers are ' ' eroes of the
hour. The solois director that 
won the sing cup no longer im

At PRR Station
If you happened to be in the 
Pennsylvania Railroad station dur
ing the past week and saw some 
artists at work you can be sire 
they were our own Tech P & D 
students out on their present 
problem. It was amusing to see a 
half-dozen students engrossed in 
their work with sketch pads and 
pencils. Some of the people sitting 
around waiting for their trains 
could not hold back their curiosity 
and so w'ould saunter over, watch 
a few moments, then ask if they 
might be sketched.
One of the models was so in
terested in sitting for the sketch 
that he ignored his buddies last 
minute call, and as a result his 
duffle bag went on to New York 
while he missed his train. Many 
of the railroad workers managed 
to get into the pictures too. With 
all the models available there i

THE CARE AND FEEDING OF ROOM-MATES
Today we take up room-mates, a delightful phenomenon of 
American college life. Ha/ing a room-mate is not only heaps of 
fun; it is also very educational, for the proper study of mankindf
i man, and there is no better way to learn the dreams and 
rives of another human being than to share a room with him.
This being the case, it is wise not to keep the same room-mate 
too long, because the more room-mates you have, the more you 
will knew about the dreams and drives of human beings. And 
thats what were all after, isnt it?
So try to change room-mates as often as you can. A recent 
study made by Sigafoos of Michigan State shows that the best 
interval for changing room-mates is every four hours.
Now let us discuss how to go about choosing a room-mate. Most 
counselors agree that the most important thing to look for in
room-mates is that they be 
people of regular habits. This, 
I say, is arrant nonsense. What 
if one of their regular habits 
happens to be beating a great 
gong from midnight to three 
a.m.? Or growing cultures in 
the tooth glass? Or reciting 
the Articles of War? Or peanut 
brittle?
Regular habits indeed! I say 
that beyond quibble, far and 
away the most important qual
ity in room-mates is that they 
be exactly your size. Otherwise 
you will have to have their 
clothes altered to fit you, which 
can be a considerable nuisance. 
In fact, it is sometimes flatly 
impossible, i recollect one time 
I roomed with a man named 
Tremblatt Osage who was just 
under se,Ten feet tall and weighed nearly four hundred pounds. 
t#here wasnt a blessed thing I could use in his entire wardrobe 
until one night when I was invited to a masquerade party. I 
cut one leg off a pair of Tremblatts trousers, jumped into it, 
sewed up both ends and went to the party as a bolster. (Inci
dentally, I took second prize. First prize went to a girl named 
Antenna Wilkins who poured molasses over her head and went 
as a candied apple.)
But I digress. Let us get back to the qualities that make de
sirable room mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes they 
smoke. When we borrow cigarettes, do 
(fWi want them to be harsh, shoddy, and 
disdainful of our palates? Certainly 
not! What, then, do we want them to 
be? Why, we want them to be gentle, 
delicately-reared, and designed to suit 
the tempo of todays broader, easier 
life! And what cigarette is gentle, 
delicately-reared, and designed to' suit 
the tempo of todays broader, easier 
life? Why, Philip Morris, of corris!
(Ill bet you knew it all the time!) 
i , To go on. In selecting a room-mate,
VSike great pains t<y find someone who 
will wear well, whom you'd like to keep 
as a permanent friend. Many of his
torys great friendships first started in 
college. Are you aware, for example, 
of the remarkable fact that Johnson 
and Boswell w^ere room-mates at Ox
ford in 1712? What makes this fact 
so remarkable is that in 1712 Johnson 
was only three years old and Boswell 
had not been born yet. But, of course,
|\|hildren matured much earlier in those 
days. Take Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
who wrote his first symphony at the
age of four. Or Titian, who painted his first masterpiece at five. 
Or Hans Otto McGrath, who was in many ways the most remark
able of all; he was appointed chief of the Copenhagen police 
department at the age of six!
(It must be admitted, however, that the appointment was less 
than a success. Criminals roamed the city, robbing and looting 
at will. They knew young McGrath would never pursue them; 
he was not allowed to cross the street.) m*shi*n, 195*

Editorial
Rushing
Rushing, which might more aptly be 
termed crushing, is as ancient and revered 
sports which dates back to the origin of fra
ternities and sororities. Through the years, 
it has developed admirably until it has at
tained the high place it occupies today. Sec
ond only to necking among intramural ac
tivities, rushing and its preparations and 
aftermath consume a major portion of the 
activities of both fraternity men and sorori
ty women.
The most concentrated effort by the men 
takes place in the early part of the fall, im
mediately upon the arrival of the unsuspect
ing victims. A typical victim is confused by 
a week of free meals, blind dates, handshak
ing, and false impressions, after which he 
either chooses to remain independent and recouperate gradually, or else finds himself 
wearing a pledge pin and wondering how it 
all happened so quickly.
But the rushing now being carried on by 
the sororities surpasses all other efforts in its 
intensity and organization. In the first place, 
it lasts three times as long as fraternity rush
ing and consumes a great deal of time which 
might normally be spent on schoolwork, Greek Sing prac
tices, or other extracurricular activities.
Another fault is that the system tends to keep the sorori
ties unequalized. If one group has built up a certain repu
tation, the period of rushing is so long that the pledges 
finally gained usually fit in with the group to such an extent 
that the up sororities stay up and the down ones stay 
down. The grab em quick fraternity system has a balanc
ing effect in that pledge classes are of a more random 
sampling.
One oft-mentioned fault of the fraternity rushing is that 
one week is not enough time for the freshmen to get to 
know enough people in the 12 fraternities, nor for the Greeks 
to become sufficiently acquainted with the rushees. Con
versely, the chief complaint about the sorority rushing is 
that it is too long. If about 400 male rushees can meet 
enough of the members of 12 fraternities in one week in 
order to be able to make a decision, why cant 120 women 
become sufficiently acquainted with only seven sororities in 
something less than three weeks?
Of course the sororities dont have houses, but frater
nity rush week doesnt have coke dates running from early 
dawn until Skibo closes. In addition, the freshman women 
haev had the privilege of one whole semesters association 
with the upperclassmen, and vice versa. Finally, is there 
some explanation why the female rushees should be given 
the advantage of more time to select than the men, or why 
the sororities should be forced to rush for a much longer 
period than the fraternities?
This editorial opinion is not necessarily held by the whole 
campus or even the whole Tartan staff, but it is the impres
sion most fraternity men have. Since, surprisingly enough, 
the sorority women seem convinced that this is the best rush
ing plan possible in the Tech environment, it would be fool
hardy to advocate a drastic revision, but it doesnt seem too 
inappropriate to remind everyone that possibly the present 
system isnt quite perfect. CFP is consistently (although usu
ally unsuccessfully) trying to improve the fraternity rush
ing system; maybe Panhell could stand to work some more 
on theirs.

Notas De Un Quente
By Luis de la Macorra
Last Saturday afternoon the Scotch and Soda 
auditions came to a close with great success. At 
one oclock, when the president John Drgon open
ed the last session of the auditions, there were al
ready several people waiting. It was late in the 
afternoon when finally everyone had been heard. 
The three big Johns, Drgon, Conboy, and Kestner, 
were in charge of receiving the people who de
sired to sing, and Carolou Fidder was in charge of 
the dancing.
I had the opportunity of listening to some of 
the tryouts and I personally "think that this years 
Scotch & Soda is composed of superior talent. From 
now until April 30, everything rests upon these 
people; the success of the show will be up to them. 
There will be hard work day and night for the 
singers, the dancers, and the crew, but on the 
night of the first performance these people will ex
perience the feeling of having accomplished some
thing worthwhile. With these few lines I would 
like to wish all the members of this years SnS 
the best luck in Head Over Heels

has climbed to one of the first places among the

to be more confident over the air. He still has to 
learn voice control when speaking to a microphone 
and his program should be better organized. Bi#
I am sure that when these details are ironed out 
his program will be indisputably the best.
As a very special feature, last week he intro

Miss Auditor is only a voice, and a very pleasing

Tartans Win 2 Games 
And Look Toward Pitt
The Carnegie Tech Tartans ended a two game loosing streak 
this past Thursday when they went an easy victory route over the 
Washington and Jefferson Presidents by the score of 84-52. There 
was a very small crowd on hand to watch the Tartans take their
second victory in a home and#----------------------1--------------------------
home series. This brought the
Tankmen Victorious Over Case 
By Relay Disqualification Route
total wins for the Tartans to a 
more respectable 7 and 10, and 
also gave the Prexies their 18th 
loss as opposed to 2 wins.
Alan Frank lead the scoring 
column for the Tech quintet with 
21 points and he was closely f Dl
l'-wed by Dick Fieler who drop^ per in 20 for the evenings activi
ties. The high man of the game 
was Romboski, a freshman cen
ter, who netted 27 points for the 
losers.
The Prexies were out in front 
only twice in the entire game and 
both times were early in the first 
quarter. Bob Stacey sent them out 
in front by 2-0 with the first bas
ket of the game, but Dick Fieler 
deadlocked the game with a nice 
k one-handed set shot.
The Prexies then moved ahead 
5-2 on Romboskis bucket and 
free throw, but Fielers, second 
fielder and a free throw by Mock
er tied up the game again and 
when Ralph sunk his second 
charity toss, and the Tartans were 
out in front to stay.
The boys from W & J were 
really falling behind when they 
decided to switch from their zone 
^into a man to man. This brought 
about the faint signs of a rally 
but they were down 13 and the 
best they could do was to bring 
it up to 33-28 just before inter
mission. However, Frank and Fie
ler were not willing to take this 
close a margin back to the dress
ing room and so they each sunk 
one from the field to make the

The Skibo Quintet seemed to 
correct for windage at the half 
and in the opening six minutes of 
the second period they dropped 
through a cool 17 points to give 
them an undisputed lead. From 
then on it was just a matter of 
playing out the clock.

Tech 77, Case 64
The Skibo Quintet put on a last 
minute flash to bring the Tartans 
back into the winning with a 77- 
64 victory over the boys of Case 
Institute on their home floor. This 
will start another winning streak 
for the Tartans with two games. 
With two minutes left in the third 
quarter, Center Alan Frank put 
the Tartans in the lead 49-48. 
With five minutes left in the 
game, Gitlando of Case, who lead 
both teams in scoring with 24 
points, tied the game at 58 all. 
But a free throw by Dick Fieler 
a field goal by Mocker and two 
free throws by_j[isn Boyd put the 
contest on ice for the Tartans.
The Skibo Five got off to a six 
point lead in the first quarter and 
they held the lead until Case 
went ahead 16-14 on two charity 
tosses by Sattele.
A floating zone defense set up
ming meet that would have other
wise gone to the Cleveland aggre
gation
It seems that in the final event 
of the meet, when Case had the 
game in the bag so to speak, their 
400 yard relay team was winning 
this last event when one of the 
judges noted that a Case man for
got to touch the side of the pool 
in turning. Also a few seconds 
later, another judge noted that a 
Tech man forgot to do the same 
and so the end resulted that both 
teams were disqualified and the 
Tartans won the meet.
The Tartans had just gained 
the lead a few seconds earlier 
when Bob Sciulli and Richard 
Derringer placed first and second

IM Basketball Still Unsettled; 
Teams Tied For League Leads
After another week of competition, the league leads are just as 
tightly contested, if not more so. While several teams met with their 
first defeat to drop out of first place ties, others staged a winning 
streak and moved up to ties for the lead. This situation is reversed 
only in the Tartan League, where#
PK A, Citcom, and the Fresh
man Architects are tied for sec
ond place, and the Trojans hold 
first place by one and one half 
games.
The Skibo League showed 
BSR being knocked out of the 
lead by DTD by the close score of 
37-36. EEME made a jump from 
last place to third with victories 
over TX B and ASCE. In the 
Tech League the Aces won two to 
move into a tie with ATO A. 
KS A took undisputed posses
sion of the lead in the Kiltie 
League, and the Grad Iggles took 
over second place as last weeks 
co-leader DU A was dropped 
into third place. The Plaid League
lead became a two-team race as 
the Vets won two, moving up with 
the Rockets. The Tartan and Scot 
Leagues leads remained the same.

ATO captured the bowling title last Saturday after scoring a 
total of 2313 pins. By doing so they replaced the Delts as campus 
champions. Sigma Nu and Delta Tau Delta placed second and third 
respectively. Individual honors for the finals went to Bob Marik of 
Sigma Nu with a 200 game and*-------------------------------------------------------

awarded this year in addition to 
that won by ATO. They were for 
high individual game and average. 
A strange case arose regarding the

left school. It will be given to his 
teammate John Alexander. Bob

rude jolt such as dispensing of 
social activities is the tonic needed 
for full cooperation. Lets hope 
that future affairs are better at

And Views
Plans are now under way for a 
series of programs for Cardinal 
Newman Day, which will be cele
brated on February 28. President 
Larry Kronenberger, Don Schrello, 
Joyce Schrello, Joe Bonk of the 
day school Newman Club and John 
Van Holt, president of Evening 
School Newman Club are at pres
ent busily engaged in working out 
fHhe program that is to take place. 
There will be more news on this 
event as the program progresses.
The semi-formal Pre-Lenten 
Dance which was held at the Hotel 
Sherwyn Ballroom was indeed a 
most gala affair and thoroughly 
enjoyed by those in attendance. 
Among those tripping the light

The Sweetheart Dance, spon
sored by the Evening School Stu
dents, was anything but success
ful, from a financial as well as an 
attendance standpoint. It is in
deed a sad plight when a small

spiring discussion by Rt. Rev. 
Msgr. H. A. Carlin, Vicar General 
of the Catholic Diocese of Pitts

Roman Catholic Church in Home
wood. The topic of Monsignor 
Carlins discussion was The Seven 
Sacraments. He analyzed each 
of the sacraments by explaining 
the origin, need and method of 
their proper administration, and 
the persons authorized as the 
proper administers of each of them.
John Van Holt, Jr., president of 
Newman Club and a member of 
the Holy Rosary parish presided 
over the meeting that was held 
prior to the discussion by the guest 
speaker.
After the meeting and discus
sion the members retired to the

snack consisting of pie ala mode 
and coffee.

 Pledges Accepted
Miss Myrtle Curtis, a student in 
the speech class, was introduced 
as a prospective pledge. Recently 
accepted pledges who were pres
ent at the meeting were: Misses 
Mary Alice Chilleo, Frances Dubaich, Evelyn Kaney, and Dorothy

Rent Problem
Tech fraternity men were some
what confused the past week 
when the administration, having 
seemingly asked CFP to consider 
raising fraternity-dormitory rents 
(the idea was rejected by CFP) 
announced that the rates would 
be increased anyway. Apparently 
the fact that increases were in
evitable was not made clear to 
fraternity representatives. This 
week the inquiring reporter ask
ed several students how they 
think fraternity-administration 
relationships can be better deli
neated.
By Alex Federowicz
Bill Yeakel, junior printerThis 
difficulty often arises with the ad
ministration from the fraternities 
point of view. The administrations 
failure to put their intentions in 
writing has resulted numerous 
times in their vacillation among 
various plans. They could avoid 
many such misunderstandings in 
the future, if they adopted the 
policy of first writing up their 
plans and then presenting them to 
the leaders of the organizations in
volved.
Dick Major, senior math  The
whole difficulty began when the 
person who was to present the 
schools plan to CFP misunder
stood what the school actually in
tended to do. Instead of presenting 
the plan to them ipso facto, it was 
presented to them for approval. 
CFP turned down completely any 
idea of paying more money. At the 
next meeting of CFP, the error was 
corrected,, and it was then that the 
cry of anguish went up from the 
fraternity men. The school could 
immensely improve their method 
of informing us of their proposed 
and intended plans by first writingthem up, and then presenting us 
with the written plans.

Leadership signifies the ability 
to accept responsibility, to under
stand a problem in all its aspects, 
and take the initiative in getting a 
job done without having super
vision, as well as getting and 
keeping the co-operation of co
workers. Leadership cannot be 
measured only in prestige accrued 
from offices held for it might be 
recognized in some one who has 
never held an office.
Service is a willingness to ac
cept responsibility, trustworthi
ness, and dependability in getting 
a job done. It is contribution 
measured in the effort put forth as 
well as in achievement.
Playhouse Comedy

Weeks Of Humor
The comedy, Mornings At

en is a warm human comedy 
dealing with the everyday life of 
next-door neighbors.
The members of the neighboring 
families are all well past 60 years 
of ageexcept for a couple of 
youngsters of around 40. The 
younger folk decide to think 
about marriage after a 12 year 
courtship and with them as a 
springboard, the mating call is 
heard through both houses.
Alma Lind and Pearl Hipps 
Bradford, favorite Playhouse com
edy duo, share top billing for the
first time since their appearance 
together in the Playhouse produc
tion of Happy Birthday two sea
sons ago. Featured roles are play
ed by Ellsworth Gearinger, Herb

being directed by William Glennon 
and features a setting by Tom 
Vawter.
Mornings At Seven is set to 
run in the Hamlet Street Theater
