Senior Saturday Classes Out 
On One Semester Trial Basis
^ Executive Board Approves Plan 
Affecting H& SS, E & S StudentsMistake?
Just when Carnegie decides 
to try a five day school week, 
a Columbia University professor 
comes out with the theory that 
a five day week is an economic 
mistake.
However, the professor refers 
to the 40-hour five day week, 
and it is doubtful that the CIT 
officials had any such hour lim
itation in mind when the re
scheduling was planned. Any
how, seniors have a chance to 
prove that the theory does not 
apply to college students.

Council Gives Away 
Dog Work To APO
With Christmas just around the corner, Council members at the 
December 14 meeting displayed the true spirit of giving when they 
awarded APO the handling of all the permanent decorations owned 
by Council. ?----------------------------------------------------
A new proposal to stop the nu
merous parking violations occur
ring on the campus was discussed.
Any person who parks incor
rectly would receive notice by 
registered mail that if his car is 
found on campus in the following 
two months, it will be towed 
away at his expense. The Frew 
street spaces do not belong to the 
school.
Bob Horsch stated, The pre
amble to the Council constitution 
places the affairs concerning the 
entire student body in the hands 
of one central organization. Since 
the duties of supervising elections 
were given APO very little has 
been required of the elections 
committee. Doing the hard dog 
work is what holds Council to
gether; if it is taken away, Car
negies governing body will not 
be recognized as outstanding by 
other schools.
Councilman Kenny, former 
permanent decorations committee 
member, maintained that the 
members of the committee did not 
have sufficient time to clean out 
the room. Council is giving away 
90% of its power for efficiency 
according to Jack Stewart.
Deciding that Council should 
be the supervisor instead of doing 
the dog work, the permanent dec
orations work was turned over to 
APO by a vote of 18 to 2.

ble in the office of the Dean of 
Men from today at noon until 
Friday, January 20, at 4:30 p. m.

Class of 1952 for class office is 
limited only by college, as an
nounced before.

Elections Chairman
Class Of 52 
Lacks Interest 
In Elections
Because of a lack of interest 
by the sophomores, not enough 
petitions for office in the Class of 
52 have been filed in the Dean 
of Mens office to provide a full 
slate.
At least two offices have no 
candidates, and one office has only 
one candidate entered. There
fore, the Executive Committee of 
Student Council decided to post
pone the election to the early part 
of next semester.
Petition forms will again be 
available in the Dean of Mens 
office. They are due Friday, Jan
uary 20.
Seniors in the College of Engineering and Science and 
the Division of Humanistic and Social Studies will have no 
Saturday classes during the spring semester.
This proposal, made by a joint committee of the College 
and the Division and approved by the Executive Board of 
Carnegie, affects seniors in all engineering and science depart
ments* and in printing and industrial management.
The committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Ludewig of the metallurgical department, recommended that in 
the spring semester of 1950 an experimental 5-day regular
-----------------------------------------------------?class week without reduction in
the present full week work load 
be scheduled for the full senior 
curriculum.
After the proposal has been in 
operation, another joint committee 
will be appointed to study the re
sults and to make recommenda
tions concerning the possible ex
tension of the policy. If the plan 
is successful, it will become a 
permanent policy on senior classes, 
and may possibly be extended to 
the junior classes. .
The new policy will result in no 
changes in the number or content 
of courses. The only change will 
be in the scheduling.
In addition to giving the sen
iors more freedom to arrange their 
work schedules to best advantage, 
the elimination of these classes 
will leave Saturday morning free 
for work on theses and projects 
and for library study. These 
mornings may also be used for 
special classes and seminars and 
for faculty consultation with stu
dents, the announcement said.
In addition to Professor Ludewig, the point committee consisted 
of Director Miner and Professors 
Gilmer, Monrad, and Simon.
Campaigning 
Lililit For SC 
Election Today
Few Candidates Yie 
For 15 Seats; Polls 
Open For Two Days
CIT students were welcomed 
back from the holiday vacation by 
few bulletin boards and large 
posters asking for their vote in 
todays student council election.
Compared to last years elec
tion, the greatest campaign in 
Carnegies history, the cam
paigning for todays election has 
been very light.
The number of representatives 
each college is entitled to is de
termined by its registration. Ten 
candidates are running for seven 
vacant Engineering and Science 
seats. Margaret Morrison has four 
open seats for its 10 candidates, 
and seven Fine Arts students are 
vying for the four openings.
Todays election inaugurated a 
new policy. Besides having all 
polls open from 11:15 to 1:45, a 
special poll will be open in Skibo 
tomorrow from 11:30 to 1:15.

Letter To
The Editor
December 6, 1949 
Editor, the Tartan:
What do the music students of 
Carnegie Tech have to do in order 
to get a little publicity in the 
Tartan? Specifically, we refer to 
the four lines at the end of the 
Kitchen Sink in the December 6 
issue. The program referred to 
therein was presented by the ef
forts of both chorus and orches
tra, which included every single 
person in the music department. 
This concert was a great success 
and was well attended, but almost 
the entire audience was composed 
of outsiders. Techites were con
spicuous by their absence, in all 
probability due to insufficient 
publicity.
The activities of the music de
partment have taken a back seat 
in the Tartan for too long. We 
work hard over here and feel that 
we are deserving of some credit. 
Very truly yours,
86 MUSICIANS. 
(Because of lack of space, it is 
extremely difficult to satisfy all 
campus organizations dernands 
for pr^blicity. However, we do not 
feel we have slighted the music 
department or their concert. In 
the issue of November 22, ap
proximately seven inches were 
devoted to the program, and the 
mention in the Kitchen Sink 
was probably better read than an 
average article. If, however, any 
one from the music department 
wishes to appoint themself as 
publicity agent for the depart
ment, we will welcome the serv
ice.Ed.)

sent. Rather than make more 
promises, however, I would like 
to pledge to the council post an 
active and unselfish devotion and 
to show the student body the 
meaning of real representation. 
Most of all I should like to raise 
council to a position where future 
candidates will not be asked as I 
was, why waste your time with 
a do-nothing organization like 
that?
Paul V. Offermann, PA 51As
my platform, I pledge my sincere 
intentions to the student body to 
work wholeheartedly in their in
terests for more undergraduate 
improvements such as was an
nounced this morning in the form 
of discontinuation of Saturday 
morning classes for seniors. A 
more constructive Student Council 
can influence these changes for the 
betterment of the students stay 
at Carnegie.
Donald J. Schumacher ChemE, 
51  School activities should be 
put before the eyes of the students 
and kept there. Too many stu
dents are in the dark about them. 
A little emphasis in this direction 
would go a long way toward in
creasing school spirit.
Leonard Smollen CE, 51  A 
strong, efficient, regulated intra
mural sports program, proper 
council support and recognition 
for the newly organized radio sta
tion WRCT, and freedom for the 
individual publications to shape 
their own paths within the al
ready defined limits are the ends 
toward which I would like to 
strive as a member of Student 
Council.

Scots Top Grove City 
In Easy 65-47 Win
Holding visiting Grove City to two field goals during the first 
half, Carnegie Techs improved cage team easily defeated the out
classed Grovers 65-47 last Saturday night before a capacity crowd
in Skibo gymnasium. ?----------------------------------------------------
The win, fifth of the season for mi  . f rrlhirty-rive 1 earns 
Enter Competition 
In IM Basketball
the Tartans as against three losses, 
partially offset the two setbacks 
suffered at the hands of Iowa and 
Westminster during the Christmas 
holidays.
Craig Impressive
Tom Craig, sensational freshman 
forward, paced the Plaids scoring 
onslaught with seven field goals 
and a quartet of fouls for a total 
of 18 points. Craigs aggressive 
play, particularly under the bas
ket, was even more outstanding 
than his sharpshooting ability.
Grove City captain Mike Bish 
led the losers scoring with 13 
markers, most of them in the sec
ond half. Carnegie guards Jack 
Riehl and Tom Beck each notched 
10 points and played an impres
sive floor game for the locals.
The Grovers opened the games 
scoring, with Fred Leetch count
ing on a well executed layup shot. 
The lead, the only one the visitors 
were to enjoy all evening, was 
short lived, however, as the Tar
tans quickly tied the game at 2-2 
and went on to pile-up a 29-13 
advantage at halftime.
Gain Three
As usual, the Plaid cagers ex
perienced a third period slump 
and allowed Grove City to cut the 
lead .slightly. Led by Bish, the 
visitors meshed 15 points during 
the quarter, while the Tartans 
could collect only 12.
However, s3me fine work by 
Craig and Beck in the final stanza 
put the game out of reach of the 
Grovers, and allowed Coach Mel 
Cratsley to use members of the 
freshman team during the final 
two minutes.

The Carnegie-Pitt series, Techs 
oldest, began in 1907 and since 
then the Blue and Gold teams 
have enjoyed 66 triumphs to 
Techs 10 wins. The Tartans last 
won from Pitt in 1942 by a score 
of 56-46. Last year the Tartans 
dropped their first game with Pitt 
48-43; in their second meeting the 
Panthers came out on the long end 
of a 76-49 score.
Whistle Workout
In the first contest the Tartans 
attempted 47 free throws, the 
highest number for any single 
game during their season. Of the 
27 free shots scored by the Plaid, 
Captain Mike Theodore sank ten 
for an all-season record.
Mike Belich, high scorer for the 
Panthers in their first game this 
year, will start at a forward post 
for Pitt. Bimbo Cecconi will prob
ably start at one of the guard 
spots for the Blue and Gold squad. 
Cecconi was selected on the North 
squad for the North-South foot
ball game and was out of the line
up at the start of the season.
Pitts offense is sparked by for
ward George McCrossin who has 
tallied 69 points in five games. The 
Panthers only win so far this 
year was a 56-39 victory over 
Connecticut. In the first annual 
Com Bowl basketball tourney the 
Panthers lost to Drake 67-55 and 
to Utah State 54-50.
Easy Marks?
Last Thursday Westminster 
tamed Doc Carlsons charges by 
a score of 49-38 and on Saturday

This Friday night the Tartans 
j will be host to a very strong Penn 
State five. The Lions are probably 
the strongest of any of the teams 
on the Plaid schedule. In a recent 
l tourney the Lions upset both West 
Virginia and Duke before bowing 
to the favorites, North Carolina 
State, in the finals. The Penn

by Colgate 68-67* in a thrilling 
overtime game last Saturday at 
State College.

fifty-third meeting of the two 
schools; the series started in 1913. 
Penn State has taken 43 of the 52 
previous contests with the Skibos 
last winning in 1940 by a 35-33 
score.
Forward A1 Tocci, who stands 
at 5-10, is the main scoring threat 
for the Lions. Tocci teamed with 
Costa and McMahan to tally 47 of 
the Lions 67 points against Col

The Tech junior varsity will 
take the court against St. Casimers High School in a preliminary 
contest starting at 7:00 p.m.

Two drama students, Harry Schofield and Leonard Feinblatt, 
can be credited with founding the Scotch and Soda club. It was 
back in 1938 that the two organized a show called No Strings, and 
ran it for two nights at the Carnegie Music Hall, during spring
carnival week. ?------------------------------------------------------
They called their production a 
revuesicalnot quite a review, 
not quite a musical. It was a huge 
success, being refreshingly differ
ent from most other top-notch 
college productions.
No False Promises 
For one, the Tech show had 
real live girls. There wasnt so 
much as a single poorly disguised 
football player parading about in 
wig, harness and skirt. Secondly, 
it was produced entirely by un
dergraduate students from every 
department in the institution.
Leonard and Harry a vote of 
thanks for their foresight.
Encouraged by the enthusiastic 
reception of No Strings, they 
formed the Scotch and Soda 
club. The club was dedicated to 
the propagation of a spring mu
sical show. Membership to the 
club was open to everyone who 
had a hand in staging a show. 
Singers, actors, dancers, electri
cians, propmen, painters, musi
cians, publicity men  all were 
made members.
Their wise planning bore fruit

Learned Different Art 
After 41s Heres to You, 
SnS gathered dust while most of 
its members learned of war. By 
46 many of them were returning 
to Tech and, although SnS hadnt 
begun to function as yet, a musi
cal was given in the gym.
Danny Franks, now an instruc
tor in the drama department, had

a good deal to do with writing the 
revival. SnS awoke, interest was 
again aroused, and in 1947 Rock 
N Riot paralyzed large crowds 
for three nights at the Music Hall. 
Next followed The Ladys at 
Work and then last years Mole
cule Man.
Smoke Brings Fire
In May 1922, two years after 
the first spring carnival, a campus-week show was given. Ever 
since then a spring musical seems 
to have had a special reservation 
in Carnegies heart. It wasnt an 
unblotted record; there were gaps. 
But always the coals of interest 
smoldered there to spring to life 
at the first sign of revival.

April on the hill overlooking the 
tennis courts. The two writers 
responsible for the bulk of the 
show decided then to write a 
show over the summer. They 
did, and Too Much resulted. 
That the efforts of these two en
gineering students were accepted 
helps prove what Scotch and / 
Sodas president Dave Clark has 
been saying every chance he gets, 
Too Much will be an all stu
