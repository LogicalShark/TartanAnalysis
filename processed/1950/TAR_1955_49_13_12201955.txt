Carnegie Receives Big 
Ford Foundation Grant
On December 13, 1955, Carnegie Institute of Technology found 
itself $1,318,000 richer, thanks to a grant from the Ford Foundation, 
which has decided to give more than 500 million dollars to private 
colleges, hospitals, and medical schools in the United States. Faculty 
members will- be glad to learnt---------------------------------------------------------
that one of the Foundations aims 
in making these money grants is 
to raise teachers salaries in the 
colleges. However, the institu
tions receiving these grants may 
use some of the money in what
ever way they think is best for 
?their particular purposes.
During the next 18 months the 
grants will be given to schools 
and hospitals across the nation. 
The colleges will receive from 
$31,000 to five million dollars, 
and grants to medical centers 
range from $10,000 to $250,000.
In Western Pennsylvania alone, 
the schools will get $5,793,000 and 
the hospitals $7,469,600. The other 
colleges in Pittsburgh received 
0 amounts as follows: University of 
Pittsburgh, $1,498,200; Chatham 
College, $169,700; Duquesne Uni
versity, $424,700; Mount Mercy 
College, $158,600. All these grants 
will be placed in the form of en
dowments for the institutions re

Resigns Post 
In Physics
On November 28, Dr. Edward 
C. Creutz announced his resig
nation as head of the physics de
partment to become director of re
search for the Atomic Division of 
the General Dynamics Corpora
tion. He has been with the physics 
department since March 1946 and 
has been its head since March 
1949. He came to Tech originally 
to work on the planning and con

It is with deep regret that 
in this holiday seafson we are 
forced to publish another four 
page issue. We realize that our 
vast subscribership will be 
bitterly disappointed, but this 
circumstance is due to the fact 
that advertisers apparently do 
not feel the need to expend 
much effort in advertising at 
a time this close to Christmas. 
Maybe they ' think all our 
money s gone by now.
At any rate, this leaves us 
in the position where we now 
stand; with insufficient adver
tising and not enough copy to 
fill all the space normally oc
cupied by the nonexistent ad
vertising, we feel justified in 
publishing only four pages. By 
this course, we also avoid the 
risk of being accused of print
ing a lot of uninteresting, 
space-consuming garbage.
The next issue of the TAR
TAN will appear on Tuesday, 
January 10, and will be com
posed of eight pages. This will 
be the only issue before ex
ams and therefore the only is
sue in the month of January. 
Any groups or individuals 
wishing to have information 
included in that paper should 
turn it in by Friday, Jai.uary 6.
Campus Chest Has 
Successful Drive, 
Totals Over $2,600
It was reported at a meeting of 
the Campus Chest Advisory Com
mittee last week that total con
tributions to the 1955-56 Tech 
Campus Chest Drive, as of De
cember 13, totaled more than $2,- 
600.00. Edward Pasierb, treasurer 
of the Chest Organization, dis
closed that the actual contribu
tions amounted to $2,594.28 plus 
$140.00 in pledges.
The current total Is a repre
sentation of 1632 contributors or 
well over 51% of the student pop
ulation. Average per capita con
tribution is $1.59. In terms of the 
University of Pittsburgh-Carnegie 
Tech competition, all reports in
dicate that CIT will probably 
emerge the victor.
At the meeting of the Advisory 
Committee, which is made up of 
28 students representing various 
activity groups on campus, aspects 
of this years drive were discunsed. 
It was suggested that the special 
student project which will receive 
5% of the allocations for this 
year, be another worthy charity 
rather than a Tech project con
sidering that Student Council and 
other service groups are sufficient 
to provide the campus with need
ed facilities. Final recommenda
tions, however, will be made by 
the Coordinating Committee of the 
Campus Chest Organization in 
January.
Also considered at the meeting 
were the relative merits <5f the 
Drives organization, educational 
methods, solicitations system, pub
licity media, and recommendations 
for next years drive.
Jan Bishop, head of the Campus 
Chest Drive, reported that the 
University of Pittsburgh Campus 
Chest reports are still not avail
able for publication.

ATOs Richard Major New CFP 
President For Spring Semester
At the regular bi-weekly meeting of the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents, held Monday, December 12, Dick Major of ATO was 
elected president of the group for the spring semester. Other new 
officers are Gary Benton of Kappa Sigma, secretary, and Jim Plugge
?of Beta Theta Pi, P&IFRC.
Les Elgart will not be available 
February 4, 1956, for the CFP 
formal as was hoped. However, 
since many nationally known or
chestras still have open dates, 
chances are that a first rate ag
gregation will be featured at the 
affair.
The council has recommended 
that the period of concentrated 
pledge training known as Help 
| Week be kept strictly to the houses 
and out of the classrooms.
The two presidents who a end
ed the CFP national convention in 
St. Louis brought back a good 
deal of information on how other 
campi are meeting problems simiFee Pre-Payment 
Suggested For All 
Eligible Students
To help reduce the amount of 
time spent by students in the reg
istration area, a plan for pre-payment of fees will be put into effect 
for the spring semester of 1955- 
56. All students may participate 
except the students who are carry
ing schedules. (Those carrying less 
than 24 units).
Those students who are not ex
cluded and who wish to participate 
in the plan will proceed as fol
lows:
At any time during the period 
of January 9 through January 25, 
students may stop at the Regis
trars Office and make their pay
ments. However, it must be un
derstood that for dormitory stu
dents, the dormitory fee must be 
paid at the same time. It also 
should be understood that all stu
dents, whether participating or 
not, must appear at the registra
tion area the same as always to 
complete schedules and fill out 
IBM forms, but the students who 
have prepaid their fees will not 
be required to go to the Wom
ens Gym where the Cashier will 
be set up.
Essay Contest
More than $350 in prize 
money is just waiting to be di
vided among as many as eight 
happy finalists in the essay 
contest on civic problems. You 
could be one of these people 
yourself, if youre an E&S, IM,

in their report was the variance 
in rushing procedures.
The plan of creating an equal
izer fee for fraternities not im
mediately entering the new hous
ing unit s was given a hearty 
thumbs down by the council. The 
fraternities feel that they are cap
able of financing and furnishing 
the new units through their'own 
saving plans and through alumni. 
They also feel that because two 
houses are unaffected by the hous
ing plan, this plan would create 
an even greater inequality.
Student Council 
Settles The Minutes 
Wording Dispute
At the Student Council meeting 
d) last Wednesday a small change 
was made in the minutes of Octo
ber 12 because of a misunderstand
ing of the wording. Earlier this 
year, when the Homecoming com
mittee was planning the major 
fall event, it discovered that the 
drama department had scheduled 
performances of The Cocktail 
Party for the same weekend. With 
the belief that this would hurt the 
attendance at the dance, the corn
el mittee requested that tickets be 
 withheld from students for the 
week-end -performances, and the 
department complied.
At the following Student Coun
cil meeting the Homecoming Com
mittee representative asked for 
the support of Council for this 
act, which was wrongly record
ed as action against.
Faulty Wording 
President Pasierb stated that a 
question had been raised by a 
member of the faculty concerning 
the wording of this business which 
began, Mr. Feigenbaum reported 
that the Homecoming Committee 
has taken action against the dra
ma department ... It was point
ed out to him, Mr. Pasierb said, 
that from the way the minutes 
were written it could be inferred 
that Council had voted confidence 
in the Homecoming Committee for 
having taken action against the 
drama department.
Since this was obviously not the

his absence Dr. Fox was acting 
head of the department.
Dr. Creutz received his Bache
lors degree from Wisconsin in 
1936 and his Ph.D. in 1939 from 
the same university. He was a 
member of the Princeton faculty 
before the war broke out, and 
during the war he worked with 
the A.E.C. on the Manhattan Pro
ject. He was a member of the 
group which headed research on 
the first atomic bomb, and was 
one of the observers of the first 
atomic explosion on June 25, 1945.
His work on the Manhattan 
project and on the Saxonburg cy
clotron gained him considerable 
prestige in the world of nuclear 
physics, and it was not without 
difficulty that Tech kept him un
til this time. The loss of his ad
ministrative ability and knowl
edge of nuclear physics will be 
keenly felt by Tech.

Once again Christmas has crept 
upon us, and undoubtedly the girls 
are shopping for unusual Christ
mas gifts for the guys. So, onc^ 
again we offer our special gift cor
ner with presents for the guy who 
must be different.
A Sterling Silver Anchovie Un
winder. Definitely the annual fav
orite for the man who loves the 
small conveniences of life. A boon 
as a conversation piece.
A Bucket of Pirhana. For the fish 
lover who also owns cats. After one 
sniff of these cannibals, no nosy 
cat will ever sniff again. Reason? 
No nose.
A Faculty Parking Tag. For the 
commuter to use on cold mornings. 
Avoids the long walk from the 
parking lot.
A Gross of A-Plus Blue Books. 
The prize gift for the playboy col
lege student. Especially conven
ient for the girl who wants the 
guy to sacrifice study time to take 
her out. As a matter of fact, this is 
a great gift for anyone.* * *
Have you notieed the lack of 
Santa Claus pictures on cigarette 
cartons, billboards advertising 
liquors, and practically every other 
item in the department stores this 
Christmas? I think the true Christ
mas spirit has sunk badly in the 
last few years, and If this is a 
method of returning to the idea 
that it is better to give than to re
ceive, I certainly am in favor of 
it. Now, if someone could stop the 
department stores from playing 
Christmas music before Thanks
giving, eliminate the number of 
Santas on every street corner in 
various big cities, and brmg down 
the price of Christmas trees, I 
think we would be taking anothef 
giant step towards the reform of 
the greatest of all holidays. In clos
ing I would like to wish everyone 
a very Merry Christmas and a 
happy New Year.

CIT Sends Five 
To Conference
Carnegie Tech will have five 
representatives among the 3,000 
college and university students, 
half of them overseas students 
now studying in the United States, 
who will make a pilgrimage to 
Athens, Ohio, December 27, 1955, 
for what is one of the most sig
nificant ecumenical encounters of 
students that has taken place in 
Christian history. Not only stu
dents but leaders from many 
countries will participate in this 
conference on the universal mis
sion of the church.
Several Christian student groups 
of the Tech campus will be rep
resented at the five-day confer
ence. Peggy Vetter and Bob 
Shields will represent Wesley 
Foundation, Carl Voight will rep
resent the Lutheran Student As
sociation, and Walt Heintzleman 
and Bill Chu will represent the 
Westminster Fellowship and the 
YMCA, respectively. Pitt and 
Chatham have also registered 
delegates.
The Reverend M. A. Thomas, 
co-secretary of the conference, 
was a recent speaker on the Tech 
compus. Five well-known men 
associated with the Student Chris
tian Federation will lead the con
ference in looking into world rev

The administration has not yet 
decided what it will do with the

ideas for spending the money. 
Techs professors and teachers will 
probably be happy if the powersthat-be decide to use the grant to 
improve their pay checks.

Some of the purposes of the YW 
are to unite in the desire to 
grow in knowledge of God, to 
seek to understand Christ and His 
love for all people, and to build 
a fellowship of women and girls 
devoted to the task of realizing 
in their common life those ideals 
of personal and social living to 
which they are committed by 
their faith.
This organization contributes to 
a students spiritual development 
not only mentally and emotional
ly, but it also promotes growth 
in social community living. The 
YWCA is composed of students of 
varied backgrounds and different 
notions of how a religious organ
ization should be constructed. The 
result is a heterogeneous group 
working together for one com
mon purpose.
Students are urged to take re
sponsibility for determining their 
own faith, contributing beneficially 
to community life, and avoiding 
stereotyped prejudices. Working in 
this way the Y helps students to 
live a richer and fuller personal 
life through the experiences, 
thoughts, and social contacts of 
others, gained through participa
tion in its activities.
Long Hard Job Ahead 
For Scotch n Soda
Two jobs essential to a good stage show but little appreciated 
by an audience are the technical director and the production co

Professional Work 
As Undergratls
Three Carnegie Tech archi
tectural students last week won 
cash prizes and professional as
signments to design quarters for 
the Pittsburgh Architectural Club.
The project, conducted by Car
negie Professor Robert Schmerjz 
and instructor Martin Chetlin, 
came about when the P.A.C. 
leased rooms on the second floor 
of a building in downtown Pitts
burgh. The new rooms needed to 
be redesigned in order to have 
adequate space for exhibitions, 
lectures, social events and dinner 
meetings. Before assigning any of 
their colleagues to the task, mem
bers of the clubs building com
mittee, Fred Fargotstein and 
Norman Frey, together with Pro
fessor Schmertz and instructor 
Chetlin derided to let the junior 
architectural students at Carnegie 
Tech have a crack at it.
The four architects drew up a 
program of requirements includ
ing a club room to seat 75 people, 
a small stage with movie, public 
address and curtain facilities, a 
lounge and bar providing library 
space, radio, TV and phonograph 
space, and service areas, including 
kitchen, toilets, cloak room, and 
heating equipment.
The project was given to the 36 
junior class members. Their prob
lem was to design workable and 
imaginative plans and interiors 
which made the best use of the 
available space and which could 
be executed without too much 
structural modification.
Judging the finished work, the 
jury was so impressed they not 
only awarded prizes but assigned 
the winners to make complete; 
drawings for the actual work and 
arranged to pay them fees for 
their professional services.
First prize went to Troy West, 
153 Cherry Valley Road, Wilkinsburg. Second prize winner was 
John Fisher, 17012 Scottsdale 
Avenue, Shaker Heights, Ohio, 
and the third prize was won by 
John Yoders of Washington, Pa.

building the theater, scenery, 
props, painting, lighting, sound 
and costumes. He also supervises 
the overall running of the various 
crews during the show. Although 
each jet has its own crew and 
crew head, John must get and 
keep them working together, be
sides conferring with the design
ers to see how their ideas will 
work.
This year he must work with 
the new problems that the theater-in-the-round will present  
the designing and building of an 
entirely new theater both in seat
ing and stage, the use of sugges
tive scenery and props, new 
lighting and sound techniques and 
open scene shifts.
John has a great deal of exper
ience in technical work oth with 
Scotch and Soda and in outside 
school activities. He has worked 
summers in a technical capacity 
at the Plymouth Rock Center of 
Music and Drama, the Adelphi 
College Theater workshop, and 
the Sea* Cliff summer theater. For 
the last two years, he has been 
technical director with the club.
John Drgon, in addition to be
ing the president of the club, is 
working as the production coor
dinator. His job is to organize all 
the various departments into one 
smooth-working efficient organi
zation that can present a finished 
show. He must also watch the 
budget of each section and con
trol the purchase of all materials 
and supplies for the club.
Both Johns have big jobs of 
organizing and pushing, but they 
must depend in the long run on 
all the people who do the indi
vidual jobs. Lots of people are 
needed and it is hoped that this 
year everyone will be interested 
in doing something for Scotch 
and Soda.

HOW TO BE A BMOC
Any man who wishes to be a BMOCyou show me one who 
doesnt and Ill show you a misspent youthwill do well to fol
low the few simple rules listed below.
The first requisite of a BMOC is, of course, a letter in athletics. 
This presents no great problem to the big, the strong, and the 
hulking. But what do you do if you are a puny little chap with 
a concave chest and muscles like tallow?
Ill tell you what you do: You go to the nearest letter store, 
buy a letter, sew it on your sweater, and wear it.
This, perhaps, is not 
strictly ethical, but chances 
are slim that anybody will 
question you about it. If 
someone should, you have a 
perfectly logical explana
tion. Simply say, That I 
on my sweater does not 
stand for Iowa. It stands 
for Infirm. ... Or, That 
P does not stand for 
Princeton/ It stands for 
Poorly.. . . Or, That 
W&L does not stand for 
Washington and Lee. It 
stands for Withered and 
Lumpy.. . . Or, That 
BG does not stand for Bowling Green. It stands for Badly 
Gangrenous.*
So, you see, getting the letter-sweater is no large task. But that 
is only a part of BMOC-hood. Another, and equally important, 
part is to #oin the right fraternity. Let me emphasizethe right 
fraternity. Joining the ivrong fraternity is worse than joining 
no fraternity at all.
How can you be sure that the fraternity you join is the right 
3he? Very simply. Just ask the rushing chairman. After all, 
why should he lie to you?
Once the BMOC is estab
lished in the right frater
nity, the next step is to get 
the right girl. A BMOCs 
girl must be beautiful, 
shapely, and go well with 
all his suits.
Girls answering this de
scription are admittedly not 
r^sy to find. If you should 
discover that all the suitable 
girls on your campus are 
already attached, do not 
despair. There are several 
things you can do.
You can, for example, cut 
your throat.
Or you can pick one of 
the less attractive ladies on 
campus, veil her, dress her 
houri pants, and tell 
Everybody she is an ex
change student from Istan- M/jnnrf niCOt't'K tbul. (A fellow I knew in liWUr# |(. 
school  Hardtack Sigafoos
by name - did just that. After several semesters he discovered 
to his surprise that he loved the girl. Today they are happily 
married and run one of the biggest Turkish baths in Ida 
Grove, Iowa.) *
We arrive now at the question: What does a BMOC smoke? 
And the answer isnew Philip Morris, of corris!
^Anybodybig man on campus or little man, big woman or 
little woman-anybody who is able to discern between harsh and 
gentle chooses new Philip Morris. Gentle is the word for Philip 
Morris. (Actually, of course, it isnt Cigarette is the word for 
Philip Morris.) But gentle describes admirably the felicitous 
blending, the smooth, mild, pleasureful flavor, the nobly born 
and delicately nurtured tobaccos, that Philip Morrisand only 
Philip Morrisbrings you.
The makers of Philip Morris, who bring you this column every week 
during the school year, cordially invite you to try todays new gentle

Titans, Marines Beat Tech
By Bob and Don
The undefeated Quantico Marines, accustomed to scoring better 
than 100 points a game, were hard pressed to top that figure against 
Tech. As seems to be their forte, the Tartans led until midway 
through the first half, when, with the score 15-12, the Marines
landed in earnest. They controlled* 
both boards and swept to a 53-34 
seore at halftime. This surge was 
led by the great shooting and ball 
handling of Ron Perry, former star 
on Holy Cross NIT champs of two 
years ago. The Marines used a fast 
break headed by Perry and Richie 
Guerin, former Iona star. When 
the roof fell in after Techs early 
spurt, it was apparent that an
other one of those nights was in 
the offing.
The Marines coach, Colonel 
James Blackwell, dredged up sub
stitutes from the bottom of the 
barrel in the second half in an at

Tech Slumps
While the Titans were pouring 
on the gas in the second quarter 
Mel Cratsleys boys had apparently 
started their halftime rest early. 
By the time the Tech team started 
rolling again they were behind by 
14 points, and the game was well 
into the third quarter.
Early in the second half George 
Strehler took up the scoring chores 
for the Titans, dumping six of his 
nine field goals, which helped him 
in taking scoring honors at 20. 
Both Davis and Riley cooled down 
considerably during this period 
thanks mainly to the close defen
sive tactics of Ralph Mocker and 
his Tartan teammates. -
By the end of the third quarter 
the Skrbo boys had shaken off their 
midgame slump and were trim
ming down the Titans lead. This 
second half surge was paced by 
some hot outside shooting by Fieler 
and Boyd and carried them to a 
brief lead at 64-63. They couldnt 
hold it, though, and as Bob Doran, 
Rileys sub, began pouring in 
points, the Titans pulled away to 
win at 75-70. During the last few 
minutes Tech blew several oppor
tunities by sloppy ball handling 
and hasty shooting.

year. However, there are at least 
two teams in each league that have 
high hopes of revising the league 
standings once play begins next 
year.
At present the individual races 
are completely dominated by bowl

Looking batk ten years to the IM scene, one would find a vastly 
different picture from that existing now. Such powerful independents 
as Emanon and the Dorm Dukes ruled the sports field in many cases. 
Not that the Greek teams were as downtrodden as the independent 
teams are now, but there was very active competition for the IM 
point trophy, a large cup awarded yearly on a basis of a teams 
performance in all the sports.
However, as the veterans who had bolstered these powerful ag
gregations gradually decreased in number, the teams disintegrated 
to the point where now there is no continuous organization from 
sport to sport, with the exception of Citcom. Even the once mighty 
Obelisks have sunk to nothing but a name whieh various dorm 
teams assume for different sports.
What were the causes of this decline? True, the veterans left, 
but there were young men to take their place. Could it be that, op
posed to accepted belief, the vets had more drive that the present 
day young uns have? Another cause is the abolition of the IM 
cup award and its permanent retirement to the shelf in the IM 
office. This cup furnished a real goal toward which "the indepen
dents could strive.
Although I am not well-acquainted with the independent or
ganizations, several needed changes seem apparent. There is a need 
for men with the ability to organize and lead any indepedent team. 
There is certaihly no shortage of such men on campus, but they have 
not come to the fore. We also should have a uniting of the shapeless 
conglomeration of teams which we now see into several strong, con
tinuous organizations.
To accomplish this, much more cooperation and participation 
among the independent students will be needed. A return of the 
IM cup as an award for over-all performance would create a much 
more competitive sports program rather than the present inter
fraternity rivalry. Thus it becomes apparent that any concerted ef
fort by the independents will benefit all the participating organizations, 
not only themselves.

Student Initiative Gets 
Aid From Dr. Strick
By Anna Hatzfeld
Is CIT preparing you for effective living? Will your total school 
environment-academic, religious, and social-succeed in preparing 
you to take an active interest as a citizen, as a professional person, 
and as a well-rounded individual in the problems of national and 
community living? If the answer*
is no, then Tech is failing in a j own You can ive him a chance 
very important phase of its pro
posed plan of education, known 
popularly as the Carnegie Plan.
The Middle States Association, 
the college accrediting organiza
tion, evaluated Techs whole pro
gram in 1953 and accorded the 
school a rating of superior. The 
MSA found that the faculty and 
curriculum of the school were ap
parently working successfully to
wards high technical objectives. 
However, the association, found 
too that the extra curricular pro
gram lacked integration with the 
purposes of the school.
Needed Self-Government
Administration studies follow
ing this report revealed, among 
other things, that a major weak
ness was the absence of an ef
fective overall student organiza
tion to control student activities. 
Students were, on the whole, 
given too little opportunity or 
encouragement to develop re
sponsibility in self-government 
and too little properly guided 
leadership experience.
Now before you rise up, torch 
in hand, to march against Ad
ministration Hall, let me inform 
you that this information was 
pointed out to me by Dr. Dale 
Strick, faculty member, admin
istrator, and friend of the stu
dent. As a member of the faculty, 
but especially in his capacity as 
Coordinator of Student Activities, 
Dr. Strick views the 1953 report 
and the existing situation of stu
dent activities at Tech with real 
concern.
Dont Wait But Do
Studying extra curricular pro
grams of previous years, Dr. 
Strick said he could see areas of 
student activity in which respon
sibility was completely out of the 
hands of students. As a result 
his office is bending over back
wards to give students the op
portunity to initiate and execute 
programs of activities.
His office, he said, is there to 
give needed advice on planning 
and doing, and is encouraging 
students, after they have planned 
and done, to evaluate what they 
have done in terms of their ob
jectives and the means used. This 
evaluation, if properly under
taken, is educationally of great 
value. Most important, Dr. Strick 
feels, is that the students are given 
the encouragement to go ahead 
with programs on their own to the 
limits of their abilities, interests, 
and willingness to accept re
sponsibility.
In general students are aware 
of the shortcomings and inade
quacies of existing activities pro
grams and their inability to deal 
with them, but because of their 
policy of waiting to be asked, stu
dents are not aware of the possi
bilities for constructive advice of
fered by Dr. Strick and his office.
Its A\l Up To The Students
This reporter was impressed 
with Dr. Sfricks sincerity in 
wanting to help the students and 
with his faith in the students 
ability to follow through on their

Guitarist Segoria 
With Symphony
Andres Segovia, the worlds 
foremost guitarist, comes to Pitts
burgh Friday evening, December
30, for a return engagement with 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orches
tra at Syria Mosque. It was ex
actly a year ago that Segovia, in 
his first appearance as soloist 
with the Symphony, wove a spell 
over the capacity audience at 
Syria Mosque that won for him 
one of the largest ovations ever 
accorded an artist here.
He will ploy the Concerto del 
Sur by Manuel Ponce, composed 
especially for Segovia. William 
Steinberg will also conduct the 
American premiere performance 
of a Symphonic Serenade for 
Strings, by the contemporary 
German composer, Erich Korngold. Completing the program will
be Tschaikowskys Capriccio Italien, Stravinskys Fireworks and 
Scherzo a la Russe, and the Over
ture to The Flying Dutchman 
by Richard Wagner.
Immediately following this con
cert, William Steinberg, musical 
director of the Pittsburgh Sym
phony, will take his annual six 
weeks leave of absence to conduct
the leading orchestras of Europe
During his absence the Orches> 
tra will be conducted by Associate 
Conductor Karl Kritz, and guest 
conductors Virgil Thomson, Fer

Beinum.
This concert will be heard on 
Friday only, with no repeat per

Domestic Travel .....................
in the Age of Jet Transports
Starting in 1959, United Air Lines flight time be
tween Los Angeles and New York will be 4!/2 hours  
between Chicago and New York, only 90 minutes. By 
placing the first contract order for jet transports to be 
used in domestic operations, United Air Lines has upheld 
its reputation as a pioneer in American air travel. Its 
new fleet of 30 Douglas DC*8 Clippers will be powered 
by the most powerful production aircraft engines in the 
world, 5-57 turbo jets, designed and developed by Pratt & 
Whitney Aircraft.
It is only a matter of time until jet transports are
