Cheerleaders Plan 4 
Rally Friday Nite
By Bob Beatty
This Friday theres going to be another pep rally to try 
and convince the football team there is some support behind 
them. 
Beginning at 7 p.m. on October 24th, the cheerleaders 
and the band will gather in fronts
of Morewood Gardens and proceed 
up Forbes Street in an effort to 
g^tpa few students away from
their books (?) and, instead, sup
porting their football team. This 
however may be wishful think
ing, as several of the comments 
heard around campus after the 
Indiana feame were of the order 
of We lost. I guess the team had 
just been lucky up to now, but 
their luck ran out. Oh well, theres 
not  much sense in seeing them 
lose to W&J, too, so Ill stay home 
and listen to Pitt. Be a better 
game, anyhow.
Typical Attitude 
Is this the attitude of the typi
cal college student? Here at Tech 
were afraid it is. Going into the 
Indiana game, we had an unde
feated season, including a sur
prising upset victory over Bucknell, and there was a little bit of 
enthusiasm shown by the fact that 
a few followers showed up at In
diana.
Apparently however, this en
thusiasm became dispelled some
where between Pittsburgh and In
diana, for the total volume of all 
the Tech rooters (excepting the 
band and its Fight Ferociously, 
etc. cheers) was exceeded by the 
Central Cambria Junior High 
School Band. This, could have 
been expected, through previous 
experience at past games and pep 
rallies.
Of course, the students defend
their position by saying that noise 
from the crowd doesnt mean any
thing to the team; however, if 
you would ask any member of the 
team, theyll tell you that they 
play much better if they know 
there is someone who appreciates 
the efforts theyre expending and 
is vocally showing it to them. As 
was overheard at Leechburg, The 
reason were playing so well is 
because we have some support be
hind us for a change!
Now, it has been stated many 
times, If the cheerleaders would 
lead us and teach us the cheers,

Rapid Progress Being 
iftade On New Dorm
Much progress has been made on the married students 
new dormitory since the ground breaking in May. Represen
tatives of D. W. Smith, Inc., builders, have set the tentative 
completion date at January 15, 1959. Occupation will begin
about February 1. ?-----------------------------------------------------
Located at 5085 to 5907 Forbes 
Street, the building has four entra^es and similar in architectur
al design to Morewood Gardens, 
the undergraduate girls dorm.
There will be room for 52 families
and they will have a choice be
tween one room efficiency apart
ments and two room arrange
ments.
Need
Lawrence Miller, head of con
struction, emphatically stressed 
the need for this dorm. He said 
tbjk housing is an integral part 
ofme operation of a school; with
out it Tech would become a city 
institution.
The three old houses, which 
hold 24 families, were built after 
the war, 12 years ago. They were 
to serve as temporary quarters for 
students living outside of Pitts
burgh. Since then Tech has ac
cepted greater numbers of non
localities and the housing situati(|t has become progressively 
w^e.
Old Houses
Razing of these old dorms wont 
begin until after June. This will 
enable students with large fami
lies to finish school before look
ing for an apartment. Only small 
families will live in the new dorm 
because of the sizes of the rooms.
There are numerous conveni
ences and improvements which 
thp occupants will enjoy. Located

Dr. E. H. Litchfield 
To Discuss Soviet 
Higher Education
Dr. Edward H. Litchfield, 
Chancellor, University of Pitts
burgh, will address the all-Tech 
assembly on Tuesday, October 28, 
in the College of Fine Arts The
ater. He will discuss Soviet 
Higher Education.
Dr. Litchfield is especially wellinformed about Russian education 
as a result of his visit to the 
U.S.S.R. this year.
What he will report will be 
based on his actual observation of 
many Soviet colleges which he 
visited during his trip.
Dr. Litchfield is convinced that 
Russia is a country where the 
serious student is a hero and 
not a grind. He does feel, how
ever, that there are still serious 
gaps in their total program.
Homecomings

By Homecoming Committee
For the first time this year 
Homecoming will have a symbol 
to represent its themeHarpo the 
Happy Hexer. Just as the frater

cast spells over Geneva through 
the curses they are using in dis
plays and varsity varieties, so 
Harpo will be hexing Geneva, we 
hope! This happy little figure will 
be everywhere on campusat the 
fraternity houses, at Call Day, in 
Skibo, at the football game, at the 
dance, and at alumni functions.
For those who want to get to 
know Harpo better, there will be 
buttons with his picture on them. 
He will be holding a little card 
for the student or alum to write 
his name and class on. The but
tons will be on sale at twenty-five 
cents, each. This is the first time 
that this has been done. It is 
hoped that it will increase the

Carnegies Tartans were stunned 
by a hard playing Indiana In

for their homecoming game and 
handed Tech its first defeat of the 
season 21 to Oi
It was the third shutout in a 
row for the Indians who now boast 
a 3-1 record, the same as Tech, 
but the defeat was especially hard 
on the Tartans as they had been 
playing hard football and many 
thought they had a chance for an 
undefeated season.
First Score
Indiana set up their first score 
early in the game when the entire 
line broke in to block a Muth 
punt and the Indians took pos

After an 18 yard run by half

The Council performs the same 
function for pledge classes of all 
Tech fraternities as does the

gain recognition for the pledge 
classes by planning several con

carried out during the fall term.
Goals
Through these projects the 
Council hopes to demonstrate that 
pledge classes are not troublemaking groups, but sensible young 
men. *
In the past there has been some 
bad publicity for pledges, and the 
successful completion of some type 
of wholesome social and charity 
projects would easily turn the op

gress committee heads meeting 
was held in the Morewood Gar
dens Dorm Counci Rloom at 4:30 
on October 5.
These meetings are held 
other Wednesday (alternating with 
Congress meetings) in order to 
facilitate the efficiency of Congress 
meetings. It is at these gatherings 
of committee heads that the work 
of the comfnittees is discussed. 
Questions end suggestions of com
mittee heads are presented. The 
agenda for the following Student 
Congress meeting is also deter
mined at this .time.
Committees <5^
During the committee meeting 
this past week, the Homecom
ing committee announced that, 
although up until now no pub
licity has been issued, it will be
gin publicizing Homecoming wide
ly during* the next twc weeks. It 
was also made known that the 
programs for Homecoming are in 
the process of being printed and 
that Varsity Varieties and Call 
Day have been taken care of.
Under the finance committee 
report, came the discussion of the 
homecoming committee budget. 
Harvey Sharp also suggested that 
congress set a deadline before 
which all budgets would be pre
sented for congress approval 
should be in. This would give the 
finance committee and congress 
greater time to review the budgets 
and make suggestions.
Spring Carnival *
Among the other reports te 
Spring Carnival committee dis
cussed the possible theme for this 
years festival and the limitation 
on the ticket sale. The library 
committee reported that they 
planned to discuss with the librar
ian the ways and means of getting 
the best possible use out of the 
library by the student body.
The committee heads then dis

Survey Made
Students at Pitt, Tech and 
Chatham know more philosophy 
than their counterparts of ten 
years ago, according to the re
sults of a survey released today 
by the Tmerson Club, undergradgroup at First Unitarian 
Church, Ellsworth and Morewood 
Avenues, Shadyside.
In 1948 local students scored 
33.8%, whereas this week Pitts
burgh undergraduates tallied 
41.9%. Chatham College led the 
lists this year as it did ten years 
ago; the 1948 score was 36.2%, 
1958 41.7%. Tech ran second again 
this year, with 44.4%. Pitt was 
third in 1958 as in 1948, with a 
lan score of 37%, but it is note
worthy that this is higher than 
Chathams winning score of 1943.
Ignorance
Asked to check two men who 
have greatly influenced exist
entialism, 27.1% mistakenly point
ed to Serge Koussevitzsky, no 
philosopher but the late, great 
conductor of the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra.
Another 31.6% were equally 
wong in supporting Protestant 
Pfcial reformer Walter Rauschenbusch had anything to do with 
existentalism (he didnt). But an 
amazing 68.5% correctly identified 
one existentalist as Jean Paul 
Sarte while 41.9% correctly iden
tified the others- as Soren Kierke
gaard.
Neophyte
14.3% went way off base in 
naming Jacques Maritain a neo
phyte (dictionary: a converted
Aathen or a beginner), which he 
most clearly is not. They might 
have chosen to identify him as a 
neo-Platonist, a new orthodoxProtestant, or, correctly, as a newThomist. Dr. Maritain is this cen
turys principal exponent of a re
vived interest in and attention to 
the Catholic teachings of theolog
ian St. Thomas Aquinas, but only 
29.3% of Pittsburgh undergradu
ates know it.
,^<\sked to specify Karl Marxs 
philosophy as either national so
cialism, dialectical materialism 
(correct), pluralism or monism, 
32.4% made the right identifica
tion.
Students were asked to identify 
William James as one of the fol
lowing: idealist, realist, prag
matist, phenomenologist. 38.5,% 
answered pragmatist correctly.
Faculty
^Faculty reaction to the results 
4a the survey indicated encourage
ment in the progress shown, with 
some dissatisfaction at the remain
ing degree of philosophical ig
norance among local college stu
dents.
Said Chathams Dr. Willard 
Arnett: The overall improve
ment is probably an indication 
that the student of today is more 
concerned about academic ques
tions than many things which we 
ifcad would lead us to believe.
Dr. Arnett is a professional phi
losopher. At Tech there is no Phi
losophy Department, but Dr. Nor
man Dawes, historian and teacher 
in the Institutes courses in general 
education, made this comment: 
It is surprising that there is such 
a great knowledge and interest in 
existentialism, and so little in a 
philosophy whose contemporary 
importance is emphasized in hiscoursesdialectical material
ism.
Emerson Club conducted the 
survey as prelude to a new series 
of Sunday 3:00 p.m. presentations 
of conte mporary philosophies, 
scheduled for the First Unitarian 
Churchs Schweitzer Room, with 
all undergraduates welcome (and 
obviously a great many should 
accept the invitation). This Sun
day, October 19, Dr. John Me* 
Cijrthy of Pitt will discuss diaIWtical materialism. The following 
week neo-Thomism will be an
alyzed by Dr. Roland Remirez of 
Duquesne. Dr. Bernard Boehland, 
also of Duquesne, will present ex
istentialism November 2. Dr. 
Arnett will discuss pragmatism 
November 9. Discussion and re
freshments will follow the pre
sentation at each session..

A point of information to our

whose front page layouts our

editors limit their editor's note to 
only points of information. The 
Tarlan editor, in an effort to shield 
an ineffective editorial, is ignoring 
journalistic tradition.
And why does our editor use 
his name or initials after his edi

his opinions? An editorial should 
express the opinions of the entire

Attendance
Editor, the Tartan:
Upon reading your editorial of 
October 14, a person may well Le 
excused if he imagines that the 
sole reason for the poor attend
ances at the pep rallies, art ex
hibits, etc., is the incapacity of 
the club officers to advertise their 
programs adequately.
The problem of poor attendance 
requires a closer analysis than 
you have provided'. It is true that 
a lack of publicity may partially 
account for small numbers on 
many occasions. Bad program
ming, namely off beat topics and 
clashing of dates, is a second fac
tor; but must the talks, etc., alfays be of a popular nature and 
can an overlap of campus activi
ties be avoided completely?
Apathy
As to that incurable student 
body diseaseapathy. May I sug
gest that man is inherently lazy, 
and will expend little energy un
less he is subjected to a form of 
motivation more powerful than 
campus advertising. The poor at
tendances at student assemblies, 
despite favorable conditions, 
would support this suggestion.
Because of your incomplete 
analysis of the problem- the justi
fication for your critical remarks 
concerning club officers is to be 
questioned.

Pit People
One of your charming coeds has 
sent me a clipping from the Car
negie Tartan October 7, 1958. In 
Readers Write Mr. John J. John 
Jr. wrote about the Pit and its 
Natives. Since I usually reside 
near Pittsburgh, I know exactly 
what he is talking about. I am a 
student at Penn State, and last 
year one of those Pit men tried 
to harm the statue of our honor
able mascot The Nittany Lion. 
Fortunately he was captured and 
given punishment.
I wish you the best of luck and 
sincerely hope you overcome the 
foe. On Thanksgiving Day Penn 
State will meet those ruffians and 
we hope to make them stuffing for 
the turkey. Perhaps between the 
two of us we can reform the 
brutes. I can cheer you, on from 
here but on Thanksgiving I will be 
there to cheer for us. Best of luck 
in your reform program.

Willie Replies
It is perhaps with less than my 
best judgment that I -bother to 
answer slurs upon by character 
and rights as a member of the 
Tech community. But I feel that 
it is my duty to myself and my 
public to reply to the idle heck
ling published last week by my 
passing acquaintance, P s y r u s 
(mis-spelled by his own spokes
man.)
This being a free campus, and it 
being impossible for me to satisfy 
my intellectual curiosity and to 
visit properly and sound out my 
friends and constituents while re
maining on the elite side of Forest 
Street, his remarks to this effect 
are without substance. As to my 
character and status, I suggest 
that Psyrus r(etire to his lair with 
copies of the Social Register and 
Whos Who on American Catnpi 
before making rash statements. ' 
Common Practice
Let me add that it can never 
be said that I have looked down 
my nose at anyone, while I have 
noticed that this is a common 
practice of Mr. Psyrus. I repeat, 
let there be passed an ordinance 
on campus barring canines over 
eighteen inches high.
I remain, by the Carnegie Plan, 
Sincerely yours, 
Willie
Chronic Criticism
One of the most dangerous intellectual pitfalls into which 
the college student may fall is that of unfounded, cronic, 
over-criticism. Though a critical mind is a necessity for every 
perceptive individual, the pompous skepticism often displayed 
by those who know just a little is a deterrent to appreciation.
This though a danger to all students is especially danger
ous to those whose fields are of an asthetic rather than prac
tical nature. An engineering student realizes that he knows 
very little about his subject and as a result does not attempt 
to evaluate something beyond his comprehension. He could 
not very well criticize a bridge that has stood and served for 
half a century, for his only criterion is performance.
Neophyte Architects
An architect, on the other hand, could (and usually does) 
criticize such a structure on some asthetic ground; such crit
icism is extremely important if we are to maintain a bal
ance between the practical and the asthetic; however, it 
seems absurd for a neophyte architectural student to blatently criticize the work of someone who has more experience 
and probably a great deal more talent. It is disgusting to con
tinually hear these self-appointed critics pedanticly display
ing their meagre knowledge in a ludicrous attack upon every 
building in existence. To hear this ridiculous group call Frank 
Lloyd Wrights museum an ice cream conen with little 
knowing smiles and condescending nods is stomach retching.
Pseudo-Criticism
The most disturbing part of this psuedo-criticism is the 
fact that it is not individual. If the student is taught that all 
buildings should be rectangular with rounded sides, he Jdll 
sneer and scoff at a round or square structure. He does not 
look objectively in an attempt to determine the true forth of 
the building but rather he will squint biasedly and measure 
beauty entirely in terms of what he has been taught.
A great need is seen for a forthright re-evaluation of 
ones own knowledge and a reservation of unfounded, inane 
criticisms.
Campus Questions: 3
Are homecoming displays getting out of hand and 
losing sight of their original objectives?
Is the 1959 graduating class in Industrial Manage
ment as poor as it is rumored to be?

IM Football At 
Seasons Peak
Favorites won handily in ev
ery IM football league this past 
week, except in the Brooklyn 
League where the Met Grads 
downed ATO A 26-24 in a hardfought contest that put the Grads 
at the top of the league with a 
3-0 record.
Citcom defeated the English?men 40-3 to tie with unbeaten 
Kappa Sigma for the Pirate 
League lead. And in the Yankee 
League, undefeated Sigma Nu and 
Tau Delta Phi each added an
other victory to stay abreast of 
Theta Xi: all three teams at 3-0.
Tailback Bob Murphy tallied 
four touchdowns on runs and two 
more on passes for a personal field 
day in Citcoms rout of the previ
ously unbeaten Englishmen.
# Grad-ATO
In the Grad-ATO game, the 
Metallurgists struck first on a 
touchdown pass from Ken Laughery to Ben Patz, and then added 
two more points on first downs. 
Then Fred Garibaldi, who figured 
in ever} touchdown ATO scored, 
connected with Pete Pence for the 
TD that nearly evened the score. 
But Grad John Cigan hit Bob 
Rapp in the end zone only a few 
^?minutes later to push the score 
to 12-6.
Early in the second quar
ter, Met rushers blocked John 
Kahlers fourth down punt, which 
rolled into the end zone for a saf
ety. Then, just before the end of 
the half, a pass from center soared 
over quarterback Garibaldis head 
into the end zone to give the 
Grads the safety that proved to be 
their decisive margip.
Third Quarter
Behind 17-6, ATO rallied in the 
third quarter for two first downs, 
but the Grads added four firsts 
and touchdown, as John Cigan 
circled left end on a quarterback 
keep, and the score rose to 26-8. 
Jim Bennett then hit Fred Gari
baldi for a touchdown, and three 
minutes later Garibaldi launched 
a scoring pass to George Paris 
to bring the score to 26-19. With 
0 kicked off, and recovered the free 
under a minute remaining, ATO 
ball on the Met 35. Bennett con
nected with Garibaldi for a 
touchdown and ATO rushed to 
kick off. But the kickoff bounded 
out of bounds, and the Grads 
ran out the clock on running plays 
for a tight 26-24 victory.

Tennis Finals
Last Saturday afternoon, the 
doubles team of Stein and Roth
enberg defeated the duo of Alan 
Wolf son and Myles Hollander in 
the intramural tennis doubles fin
als by scores of 6-3, 6-0.
Case Tech Trounced 
By Tartan Harriers
By Lyn Carman
Techs hard running harriers continued to roll during 
the early part of last week as they crushed Case Tech on 
Tuesday by a score of 15-50.
Once again Techs senior trio of Dick Hamilton, Eric
Ottervik, and Bill Wittman crossed ?----------------------------------------------------
the tape together to post the win
ning time of 25:32. The Ohioans, 
not being accustomed to Pennsyl
vanias hills, never were in con
tention on the tough Schenley 
Park course. The Tartans placed 
the first seven men in the race 
the cross country equivalent of a 
shutout.
Slippery Rock
On Saturday, however, the Plaid 
had rougher going. The Techmen 
travelled to Slippery Rock and 
lost the meet 24-33. Dick Shirey 
of Slippery Rock finished first in 
the race, but he had to set a new 
course record of 25:21 to do it.
After a badly mismanaged start, 
Shirey set a fast, even pace fol
lowed very closely by Hamilton,
Ottervik, and Wittman of Tech. 
This was the situation for about 
three-fourths of the race.
At the start of the last loop, 
Shirey began to move out, Hamil
ton following, and Ottervik and 
Wittman dropping back slightly. 
Then as the loop swung into Slip
pery Rocks treacherous, bogfilled, stump - littered woods, 
Shirey poured it on, and it was all 
over. The Rockets swept to their 
sixth victory in seven starts. 
Shirey and Mooney of Slippery 
Rock took first and second fol
lowed closely by Hamilton, Otter
vik, and Wittman of Tech. Bill 
Anderson was ninth, the only 
other Techite in the top ten 
finishers.
Although thfe victory was a 
fairly decisive one for Slippery
Rock, it was considerably cheap
ened by some deliberate displays 
of unsportsmanlike conduct on the 
part of the Rockets coach and 
team.
Until Saturday, the Techmen 
had a good deal of respect and 
admiration for Slippery Rocks 
athletes. Not any more. There is 
no excuse for that kind of conduct 
in college athletics. It is regretable when the actions of a few 
cast aspersions on the whole of 
the student body of a reputable 
school like Slippery Rock State 
Teachers. It is sincerely hoped 
that it wont happen again.
Rest of Season
Although Tech has now lost one, 
the outlook for the rest of the sea
son is optimistic. The Tartan thinclads are still a strong contender 
for West Penn Conference Cham
pionship honors. They get another 
crack at Slippery Rock at the TriState Championships on Novem
ber 14.
The next meet is against West
minster this Friday. It will start 
at 4:00 on Flagstaff Hill. Tech is 
slightly favored.

political Clubs 
Hold Debate
On Sunday, October 26, at 7:45 
p.m. in the Carnegie Union rep
resentatives of the two newly 
formed political clubs will face 
each other in public debate for its 
time. Professor John Hart 
will attempt to justify Democratic 
policies, and his G.O.P. opponent 
will be Professor Alan Meltzer.
All students are invited to at
tend and perhaps put both parties 
on the spot. The discussion will be 
followed by dancing and refresh
ments.
This is the first meeting to be 
organized by the newly elected 
? officersDavid Hall, presi
dent; Alibas Labbauf, Marsha 
Spiers, Mario Volpe, Peter Wray, 
vice presidents.
Pep Rally
[continued from, page 1] 
wed yell with them. Believe me, 
the cheerleaders have tried over 
and over again to teach the Tech 
^rients the cheers, but it is psycmdogically impossible to teach 
people something they refuse to 
learn. When the cheerleaders 
spend several hours printing up 
and distributing cheers, and then 
see them flying down at them in 
the form of paper airplanes, this 
becomes very discouraging. And 
after trying three or four cheers 
and discovering that there were 
a total of six people cheering 
themselves  who wouldnt get 
iWfully disgusted and just sit 
down?
Students Cheer
If the cheerleaders would, for a 
change, get one-half the students 
at a game to cheer with them and 
hear something besides Hold 
Tenaciously from the audience, 
Im quite sure that there would 
be no stopping them in their at 
tempts to improve the cheers, im
prove themselves, and thereby im 
lfk>ve the quality and quantity of 
the cheering for the team.
But, if these improvements are 
to take place at Tech, there is 
going to have to be some coopera
tion from the student body and 
the fraternities. By this, we mean 
there will have to be a lot of stu
dents show up for the pep rally 
Friday night so that when it hits 
Tech Bowl, the team will know 
that there is somebody wanting 
Am to win and cheering for 
them to win besides the cheer
leaders.
Therefore, Friday evening, lets, 
for a change, have a good turnout 
for the pep rally to show the team 
there is some support behind 
them, and another good one Sat
urday afternoon for the game. We 
can still have a 7-1 record if, and 
only if, the entire student body 
supports the team vocally by 
:^L>wing them Friday evening and 
Saturday afternoon that we do 
want to see a victory by Tech, and 
not just a place to sit in the sun 
for three hours and look at each 
other.
Pledges[continued from page 1] 
there is something to fight for. 
d a good opportunity to compare 
the vitality of the various pledge 
classes as they try their best to 
win the cheer contest.
Representatives of the pledge 
classes have been meeting for the 
last several Saturdays and the 
final meeting is to be held this 
Saturday at 1:00 at the Beta Theta 
Pi House. Those pledge classes 
who do not send representatives 
will be disqualified from the cont
rition.

commented that there is only one 
way to make love, but a thousand 
ways to commit a murder.
Professor George Williams in his 
new and critical commentary on 
higher education in American, 
Some Of My Best Friends Are 
Professors, warns that there is 
only one way to be a good pro
fessor, but there are at least seven 
ways to be a very bad one.
Universities
Concerned with the failues and 
failings in the American univer
sity today, and convinced that 
these stem from the ineptitude, 
timidity arid inadequacy of too 
many professors, Dr. Williams of 
The Rice Institute, Texas, de
scribes, in solemn censure and 
concern for Americas youngsters, 
these seven types of the bad 
professor.
Worthy of first mention be
cause he may be a very good man 
while being a very bad professor, 
is the plain stupid professor. The 
ways to be stupid are multiple. 
The stupid professor may  be 
merely ignortant ... or he may 
be too stupid to know when he is 
boring people, or when he is ansays, the stupid professor is a 
rule-follower, because rule-fol
lowing simplifies life for him.
The second bad professor is the 
smug professorthe one who is 
convinced that he is most clever 
and most knowing and has prov
ed to himself that he is a pretty 
smart fellow. He must be a pretty 
smart fellowr after all to have j 
gotten where he is. Daily asso
ciation with his immature stu
dents further convinces him. He 
is eager to assist his students; that 
is, the ones who agree with him 
and admire him.
Arrogant
Fortunately less common is the 
third type of bad professor, the 
arrogant one. He is never arro
gant to those above but, always 
arrogant to his students, as well 
as to faculty members who are 
his inferiors. He is rude and has 
forgotten what Emerson knew: 
that the secret of education lies in 
respecting the pupil.
A much more common, and 
much less obnoxious, type is the 
fourth professor, the one who just 
does not care about people. He 
likes science and scholarship, 
books and libraries; he likes learn
ing, and he may even enjoy talk
ing about what he knows. But he 
has no real human warmth, 
friendliness, empathy, or under
standing of the personalities and 
points of view of his students or
is loved by the trustees, the pres
ident of the university, the heads 
of departments and the wealthy 
people of the town for his dis
arming frankness and urbanity. 
His complacency assure all con
cerned that everything is well 
with the university. He scoffs 
gently at convention, yet cooper
ates perfectly with every conven
tion that really matters on campus 
Final Type 
The final type of professor
whom Dr. Williams excoriates is 
the one who, working within the 
new vision of education as the 
output of an administrative
team, and referring to his imme
diate superior as the chief, 
teaches in a supremely business
like way , . . To this professorturned-executive, the students are 
so many items to be processed, 
so many completed jobs to be 
turned out according to schedule 
This professor loses sight of 
the student as a human being ... . 
a separate personality whose
uniqueness goes unrecognized in 
the pursuit of administrative ef
ficiency and teamwork.
And if Dr. Williams is severe on 
some of the professorial types in 
his book, he reminds us all, in his 
title, that Some of My Best 
Friends Are Professors. (Publish

Davis to McKay. The conversion 
was good and Indiana took a 7

teams playing to a standstill, but

point made the score 14 to 0.

patented last quarter comebacks 
and moved downfield to the In

failing to make a first down by 
inches.
Final TD

quickly scored again, with a Davis 
to Signetti pass for 40 yards set^ \

score when frosh end Arendas 
blocked an Indiana kick and John 
Zinni recovered for Carnegie on
