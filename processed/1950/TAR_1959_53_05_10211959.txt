Capture First Place Honors
The $2,800,000 library to be built on the sight of Skibo, will be under construction before Decem
ber 1, 1959. The latest change in plans will mean the closing of Skibo on October 30.
Skibo To Close 
Hun tLi brary Program
Given New Schedule
Last Thursday at a special meeting attended by faculty 
and student leaders, President Warner announced a break
through in the Hunt Library construction schedule.
, This development, a three month acceleration of the plans
set last June, will result in some*------------------------------------------------------------
major changes in the food service both buildings will be acceleratFrom amid a shambles of mal-functioning mechanical 
wonders, Sigma Nus Brussels Worlds Fair emerged as 
the winning display. Delta Upsilons Off at Cap Canaveral 
and Alpha Tau Omegas H-Bomb took second and third 
place honors, respectively. ?------------------------------------------------------------
Sigma Nus display centered 
about a model of the Brussels 
Fair Atomium, a large, aluminumappearing replica of an atom. On 
one side of this impressive back
ground stood the U.S.A. pavilion, 
complete with Scottie dog on top 
(Why not?), while on the other 
side a smirlsing Wolverine sat 
upon the U.S.S.R. exhibit. Subtle! 
The action was as follows: A 
football was tossed into the air 
by the Scottie dog. The Wolverine 
caught the ball in a basket which 
he held, not noticing that the ball 
had been cleverly metamorphsifor faculty and students during 
the coming weeks. Plans call for 
Skibo to close on October 30 and 
to be dismantled immediately. 
The library itself will be under 
construction on or before Decem
ber 1 of this year. The completion 
date has been set for December 
or January of the next school 
l^ear.
Unforseeable
Dr. Warner stated that the 
breakthrough came about in an 
unforseeable manner, fhe Campus 
Activities Center, which is cur
rently under construction on the 
Cut, is*" being built by the George 
A. Fuller Co. The same architects 
that worked on the Center are de
signing the library. Because of the 
working relationship between the 
>^>ntractor and the architect, Tech 
Vias an opportunity to take ad
vantage of an excellent proposal 
that has developed.
Explaining the plan, Dr. War
ner said, By working with the 
architect, the Fuller Company, 
which was low bidder on the 
Campus Activities Center, offered 
to undertake construction of the 
library at a fixed price; they ask 
no escalator privileges in their 
. >ntract, and they agree to pass 
On to Tech ninety percent of any 
savings they may realize in the 
course of construction. This pro
posal means that we do not have 
to wait for detailed working 
drawings and the bidding pro
cess, but can start construction on 
the library on or before December 
1. By running both contracts sim
ultaneously, and it is felt that sav
ings will occur and progress on
ed.
Food Changes
The changes in food service that 
will occur under this latest plan 
are similar to those that would 
have occurred under the former 
plan of initiating construction in 
the spring of 1960. Although final 
detailed plans for the feeding oi 
the. faculty and students involved 
are not yet complete, the basic 
plan is clear. The Faculty Club 
ended food service last Friday as 
did the staff dining room in the 
back part of Skibo. After reno
vation the Faculty Club building 
will be known as Forbes Hall and 
will provide dining facilities for 
about 200 undergraduate men. 
The Morewood Gardens cafeteria 
will serve another 400 under
graduate men with substantially 
no change in the service to wo
men.
Commuters will make Web Hall 
their new home which is to be 
equipped with vending machines.

for the program.
The Council of Fraternity

awarded to the Kappa Alpha

Beautiful Doll, announced the 
entrance of the Homecoming 
Queen and her attendants. The

Delta Upsilon
Delta Upsilons display was per
haps not quite so complex but 
was certainly tastefully designed 
and well constructed. Following 
a recorded countdown, one 'of a 
group of well-made little scien
tists, face contorted in a sadistic 
grin all too close to real life, 
pushed a button on a complicated 
instrument panel. This launched, 
amid blinking lights and twirling 
dials and against a starry back
drop, a silver rocket containing 
and unfortunately capsulized Wol
verine.
Capturing third prize was Alpha 
Tau Omegas H-Bomb, an elab
orately constructed display in the 
painstaking ATO tradition. As a 
Wolverine in football uniform 
swept down the field toward what 
was apparently an easy touch
down, a paternal giant of an 
alumnus, peering down through 
the clouds, saved the day by 
dropping an H-Bomb. This, as 
might be expected, stopped the 
Wolverine on the spot. The game 
was thus saved and up jumped a 
cheerful Scottie dog waving a flag 
welcoming the alumni.
And next year, when the elec
trical engineers are even more 
skUled, and the tricky relay is 
belter understood, perhaps some 
of the displays will actually work 
as iptended for more than ten 
minutes.
Varsity Varieties
1 In keeping with the theme of 
Homecoming, each sorority chose 
; a significant event of the Fabu| lous Fifties in presenting their 
I skits at Varsity Varieties.
First place winner, Delta Delta 
Delta, chose the Statehood of 
Alaska. In the skit, Alaska was 
known as Skibo Summit and 
Texas as the Grove City Corral 
As Texas heard that Alaska was 
now the largest state in the union 
and was, in fact, twice as larg? 
as Texas, they were furious. How
ever to keep Texas quiet, the 
Alaskans told them that if they 
didnt act properly that they 
would be the third largest state, 
thereby defeating Texas.

Stone Age
cene
By David Stock
On October 4, 1957, a new era in the history of man of
ficially opened. The Space Age was born when the Soviet 
Union announced to the world that the earth had a new 
companion on its journey around the sun: Sputnik. Since
that day, the world has become 
space-conscious.
Every new triumph or failure in 
rocketry has brought sweeping 
changes in prestige, international 
policy, and the stock market. The 
suffix -nik has become the most 
overworked in the language. 
Comedians poke fun at Cape Ca
naveral instead of the Pentagon. 
Religious fanactics proclaim that 
the exploration of space is con
trary to the w'ill of God. Con
gressmen spend sleepness nights 
thinking up ways to explain the 
huge expenditures of the tax pay
ers money on space projects to 
the folks back home. Why has all 
this come about?
Curiosity
Since his earliest history, man 
has been intrigued by the spec
tacle of the heavens above him. 
Every religion he invented has as 
a central feature an explanation 
of the nature of the sun, moon and 
stars. As the centuries passed and 
mans knowledge of the universe 
grew, his curiosity also developed. 
Kepler, Copernicus, and Galileo 
enriched our knowledge of the 
heavens and whetted our appetites 
for more. Man had to find out 
more about his surroundings. 
What are other planets like? Do 
other suns have planets? Is there
life on other worlds? If there is, 
what kind of life? How do our 
concepts of God fit into the uni
verse?
Mans native curiosity, once 
touched off, is almost unstoppable; 
once he has placed his feet on the 
paths of knowledge, he can not 
easily turn back, even though he 
may never reach the end. Our 
greatest philosophers discovered 
long age that there is no end to 
the path; there are no real an
swers in life, no ultimate satisfac
tions, but only the questions, the 
search for truth.
Spirit
It is this spirit which is sending 
us out into the universe, act not 
the men of war who would turn 
the heavens into symbols of na
tional pride. The pioneers, the 
dreamers, who developed the ideas 
of space travel, were not concern
ed with dropping bombs from 
satellites or international prestige; 
they wanted man to discover the 
universe, and to find his place in 
it. If men climbed mountains only 
because they are there to be 
climbed, so men will explore the 
heavens because they are beckon
ing onward. Perhaps the harmony 
of creation and the wonders of the 
universe can inspire us to look 
within ourselves for the way to 
peace on our own planet.
Doherty House ^ 
Dedicated Saturday
By pulling a cord which unveiled a bronze plaque, Mrs. 
Pearl E. Doherty, widow of Techs third president, Dr. Robert 
Ernest Doherty, officially dedicated Carnegie Techs new 
apartments for married graduate students last Saturday
morning.
The dedication ceremony was 
officiated by Dr. John C. Warner, 
successor to Dr. Doherty as presi
dent of Carnegie Tech, and in
cluded an invocation by Rv. 
Hugh Clark, minister of the 
Church of the Redeemer, a bio
graphical sketch of Dr. Doherty 
by Mr. James M. Bovard, Presi
dent of Carnegie Institute and 
Chairman of the Board of Trus
tees and remarks of Mr. Fred Jen
sen, a graduate student living in 
the Doherty Apartments.
Dr. Doherty
Mr. James Bovard related how 
Dr. Doherty was born in Clay 
City, Illinois, in 1895, and after 
working as a telegraph operator 
for the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
roads, graduated in 1909 from the 
Academy of Illinois. He continued 
his studies at Union College 
where he was awarded his Mast
ers Degree and then took a job 
with General Electric in 1923, as 
consulting engineer. In 1931, Dr. 
Doherty joined the Yale faculty 
as a professor of electrical engin
eering and then became a dean at
Yale.
Both Mr. Bovard and Dr. War
ner emphasized Dr. Dohertys 
avid interest in graduate studies 
which he considered an essential 
part of professional education.
Carnegie Plan
As Carnegies president from 
1936 to 1950, Dr. Doherty created 
and developed the concept of the 
Carnegie Plan of Professional Ed
ucation, more than doubled the 
Carnegie Tech endowment, and 
brought to Tech many disting
uished faculty members.
During his presidency a new 
wing was added to the Engineer
ing and Science building, Morewood Gardens was purchased, a 
400 million electron-volt synchro
cyclotron and nuclear research 
center established as Saxonburg, 
and the Graduate School of In
dustrial Administration was plan
ned.
Those present at the ceremony 
included Dr. Dohertys sister, four 
children, his personal friends and 
alumni.

Saturday Dance 
In Gymnasium
With only two and a half 
months of the Fabulous Fifties 
left, Techs homecoming dance 
provided a more than successful 
tribute to a truly fabulous decade 
last Saturday night. The dance, 
which was the climax of Techs 
1959 homecoming weekend, was 
held in the gym from 9 until 1:00.
More than eight hundred cou
ples danced to the music of Tom 
Koneski and Ray Crummie. Tom 
Koneski provided big band dance 
music for the people in the gym 
while Ray Crummie played for 
the combo enthusiasts in Thistle 
Hall.
The awards for the Homecom
ing competitions were presented 
at 12:00. Homecoming chairman 
Mike Bass introduced Toni Sams 
who awarded the trophies, the 
first of which went to Bata Sigma 
Rho for the pledge cheer.
The decorations were simple 
and consisted mainly of posters 
about the themes of the sorority 
skits.
Beta Sig Wins 
Pledge Cheer
The Homecoming weekend is 
not complete without the tradi
tional pep rally and pledge cheer 
competition on the night before 
the game. Rege Cordie was the 
master of ceremonies and intro
duced the twelve cheers which 
were presented.
The winning cheer was that of 
Beta Sigma Rho; it was called 
Oh No, Oh Yes and was accompanide by vigorous gestures 
and repitition of the phrase Go 
Carnegie Go.

Referring to the timetable of 
events, Dr. Warner said, Un
doubtedly some short cuts will 
have to be devised; some habit 
patterns will be upset; some of 
us may even feel imposed upon. 
But I have faith in the true Car

Separate Publication
Frequently in the past Evening Student Council has cons^ered the merits of having a regular night school publica
tion.
This matter was openly discussed at the recent Insignia 
Award Banquet. The question was* 
whether there should be a separate publication aside from the 
Plaid distributed to evening stu
dents. Concensus of opinion was 
that the Plaid, should be continued 
for at least a year after permis
sif would be obtained from the 
administration to publish a night 
school paper so that coverage of 
evening student activities is main
tained while the new publication 
is developed.
A committee was appointed 
which included Dr. Robert S. 
Ramsay, Dr. Dale E. Strick, on behelf of the administration, and 
n'((|pibers of Council, Miss Mary 
Alice Peterson and Mrs. Eleanor 
Iwinski. The committee will work 
out details of the content of the 
publication, frequency of distri

ters for presentment in an effort to 
obtain approval of a separate pub
lication for evening students.

Glenn Klepac continued to run 
well, and Bill Anderson showed

Against Case at Cleveland, Wernigice of the home team won in 22:11, with Dobras, Klepac and 
Anderson occupying the next 
three spots. Techs fourth and fifth 
men, Pat Chamay and Bill sproul, 
were far behind, however as Case 
took the fifth through tenth posi

Dobras and Klepac had fine 
times against Slippery Rock, but

as Tech absorbed a 19-39 defeat.

ly pursued by Dobras, whose time 
of 24-17 was 17 seconds off the 
school record. Klepacs time of

The winners keep winning and the losers keep losing as 
I. M. football teams ended their third week of play. Ten of 
the eleven teams who entered the week undefeated are still 
undefeated, but competition is tightening.
The lone upset occurred in the already mixed up Eagle 
League where spunky Citcom outplayed a big GSIA squad. 
Coming from behind twice in the close fought contest, Citcom 
took advantage of a loose defense and hustled the Grads off 
the field. The two big names for Citcom were Bob Beitle and 
Paul Waslis. Beitle had a hand in all the scoring, either pass
ing or running. Waslis proved^ 
himself to be one of the smartest 
players in the league by his shifty 
running and alert defensive play.
Citcoms victory knocked GSIA 
out of their tie for first place, 
leaving ATO A alone on top.
Led by the fine play of Bill 
Novak, ATO A stretched its 
winning streak to three games de
feating TDP A 25-11.
Delta Upsilon won their first 
game of the year 41-1 over SAE 
Lions on a muddy field. Victory 
came easily for the DUs who lost 
their first two games after holding 
half-time leads.
Bears
The Bear League remains in a 
three way tie for first place with 
KS, SN, and PKT all winning. 
Kappa Sigma# had the roughest 
fight of the three with always 
tough but never victorious Theta 
Xi. TX held the Kappa Sigs to 
their lowest score of the year, but 
couldnt get their own offense roll
ing in the 12-0 game.
Phi Kappa Theta continued to 
be one of the biggest scoring 
teams in IM Football, running up 
33 points against ATO B. Bruce 
Kissell played a good game at 
halfback for the Phi Kaps while 
Joe Freiland again was the main 
scorer. The weather proved to be 
a bigger threat to Sigma Nu than 
Metals Club as they oozed to an 
18-2 finish on a rain soaked field. 
Karl Mandry, SN quarterback, 
passed well on a field that made 
running nearly impossible.
Giants
The Giant League also remains - 
in a three way tie for first place. 
Delta Tau Delta ran up the biggest 
score of the league leaders, de
feating Tau Delta Phi R 54 -5.
SAE Purple downed Obelisk 
40-0 making use again of one of 
the best rushing lines and defen
sive backfields in IM Football. 
All-school lineman Ray Nix and 
halfback Dick Aust led the defen
sive unit to their second shut-out 
in three games.
PKA had little trouble gaining 
its third straight victory in a 41-19 
contest with Clyde St. Bill Hall 
led the PiKAs attack passing accu
rately.
Steelers
In the only game played in the 
Steeler League, SAE Gold de
feated Newman Club 40-11. Char
lie Nelson played his best game of 
the year at quarterback for the 
SAEs. Bob Walker looked good at 
halfback.
This weeks football will bring 
dreams of first place to an end for 
at least five of the league leaders. 
For the first time the unbeaten 
squads will be pitted against, each 
other, and league championships 
takes on the Met Grads and BTP, 
PKT plays both KS and SN, PKA j 
plays SAE purple and DTD, and | 
ATO A takes on GSIA.
