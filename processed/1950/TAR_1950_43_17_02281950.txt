CIT Student 
Parking Space 
To Be Cut
New IA Construclion 
Aggravates Condition; 
Violators Block Lanes
No immediate relief is in sight 
for the serious parking problem 
facing all CIT students who drive 
to school. As soon as construction 
begins on the news industrial ad
ministration building, the lot be
hind Skibo will be closed.
Other lots under administration 
supervision are between the TX 
and DU houses, besides the FPHA 
barracks, behind Industries hall, 
and between Engineering and 
Machinery halls. The last two 
mentioned are for faculty use only, 
as are all the spaces on Margaret 
<Morrison street between the gate 
and Fine Arts.
Most of the violations so far 
have been for blocking the 
through traffic lane on the gym^nasium side of the Skibo lot. This 
lane is left clear so that drivers 
' who cannot find a space may con
tinue around and leave the lot. A 
parking director is in the lot early 
some mornings to insure that no 
cars block any of the lanes.
All of the parking area along 
Frew street belong to the city, and 
the school has no supervision over 
regulations or violations there. 
Anyone having a complaint or 
question concerning campus park
ing should address his views to 
the Dean of Men.
REA Offers 
Many Jobs 
To Engineers
Because the rural electrification 
program is progressing at a faster 
rate than ever before attained, the 
Rural Electrification Administra
tion is recruiting electrical engi
neers for work in Washington and 
in the field.
Qualified engineers with exper
ience in any of several branches 
of the electrical utility industry 
are being sought. Distribution, 
transmission, or generation exper
ience, whether in construction or 
operation, can serve as a quali
fication.
While REA does not build, own, 
or operate power facilities, it re
views specifications, inspects com
pleted construction, and offers 
technical advice on operation to 
its borrowers. So far, REA bor
rowers have constructed almost a 
million miles of power lines serv
ing more than three million con
sumers; during the fourteen years 
of REA existence, the percentage 
of farm electrification has increas
ed from 10 to 80 per cent.
The starting salaries of the 
electrical engineering positions 
now open with REA are $4600 
and $5400 a year, depending upon 
training and experience. Inquir
ies should be directed to Person
nel Division, REA, USD A, Wash
ington 25, D. C. The standard 
Government employment applica
tion, Form 57, can be obtained 
from most post offices and other 
Federal agency offices throughout 
the country.
Dont Let The 
Tartan Slip Up 
In Its Coverage
Does your club or organiza
tion want to see its activities re
ported in the Tartan? Is it do
ing anything that would be of 
interest to the rest of the cam
pus? Do you know of anything 
that is happening on the campus 
which is not being reported by 
the Tartan?
If the answer to any of the 
above questions is Yes, walk, 
dont run, to the nearest tele
phone and let us know about 
it. Tartan reporters try to cover 
every possible source of news, 
but they may be slipping up. 
They want your help.
Should you have any sugges
tions call MU 1-7017 or drop a 
note to the Tartan through in
ter-school mail at the CIT Post 
Office.

AIGA Notice
The Carnegie Tech chapter of 
the American Institute of Gra
phic Arts has announced that 
negotiations are being made with 
the New York offices of the 
AIGA to bring an exhibition of 
285 specimens of the works of 
prominent typographers to CIT.

if plans materialize, the display 
will be held in the Exhibition 
Room of Fine Arts building. 
Tentative plans call for the ex
hibition to be held in April. 
Definite dates will be announced 
in further editions of the Tar
tan.
Wes Kennys 
ODK Project 
Is Praised
Recognition has been granted to 
Wes Kennys three year plan for 
redesigning Skibo. His plan pre
sents the problems, suggests 
changes, and gives information re
garding redecorating materials. 
The plan was first presented by 
Kenny as his ODK pledge project.
Through a letter from Dr. Min
er, Kenny, senior drama student, 
learned that the committee on 
auxiliary enterprise and conces
sions was greatly interested in 
his plan and the sketch submitted 
by James Trittipo, also a drama 
senior.
Thorough And Sound
Kenny was complimented on the 
thorough analysis and sound 
suggestions in his project. The 
letter further stated that some
thing will be done in accordance 
with his proposed step-plan and 
its objectives as soon as sufficient 
funds were available.
Until 1920, when more space was 
needed for feeding faculty and 
students, Skibo was an aeronauti
cal laboratory. Redesigned for 
supposedly. temporary accommo
dations, the cafeterias looks and 
comfort were disregarded. The 
primary objectives of the plan are 
to remedy the factory-hangerlike 
appearance and to add to the com
fort of its patrons.
False Ceiling
Among the suggested changes 
was the addition of a false ceiling 
to cover the rafters and to reduce 
the noise at meal times. This al
teration would necessitate the re
vision of the present lighting sys
tem.
The plan also proposed that 
murals be painted on the walls 
depicting sports scenes, campus 
scenes, famous events, etc. Fur
thermore, a large picture frame 
would be put at a strategic place 
to display the picture of the in
dividual or group on campus cur[Continued on page 4]
Film Group 
Extends Movie 
Presentation
The Film Group, sponsored by 
P&D seniors, has started a second 
semester series of unusual mov
ies. This semester the group is 
presenting well known films made 
in the early days of the movie in
dustry.
A new policy has been introduc
ed whereby two showings will be 
held, one at 4:30 p.m. and one at 
7:30 p. m. All the performances 
will be held in IH 104. One movie 
has been presented and the fol
lowing will be shown on the dates 
scheduled:
March 1: Fall of the House of 
Usher.
March 8: Three Musketters.
March 15: Great Actresses of the 
Past.
March 22: Chaplin Comedies.
April 19: Buster Keaton and 
Harold Lloyd.
April 26: David Harum With 
Will Rogers.
May 3: MPeter Lorre.

Editorials
Earn It
Student Council spent a large portion of its 
time last week discussing plans to better pub
licize its functions and activities to the student 
body. One plan suggested was a pat-on-the-back 
committee. Believe us, patting oneself on the 
back is one of the easiest methods of breaking an 
arm.
It wouW seem more sensible to alleviate 
or solve a few more of the campus problems 
and allow student recognition to develop natur
ally rather than start a publicity drive.
Council is in the best position in years to es
tablish itself as a useful organization on campus. 
The councilmen are all capable of producing 
worthwhile accomplishments and Council is free 
of the petty bickering which prohibited pro
gressive action last year at this time. We hope 
that Council will take advantage of this ideal 
situation to earn the publicity it desires.
Pro9gress:
Looking back through the Tartans of last year, 
we find, happily and unhappily, that many things 
have changed during the months, while many of 
the news articles and editorials could be reprinted 
almost without change.
The sports picture looks considerably brighter 
this year, and we wonder how many students re
member the demonstration against the admin
istration because of the football situation.
Seeteh 'a Soda is in the planning stage 
again this year as it was in the past, and an
other blast has been leveled at fraternities in 
a national magazine.
We have not seen the furious political cam
paigns on campus this year, but neither have we 
seen the petty bickering whigh greatly handi
capped Student Councils efficiency a year ago. 
No cne has donated six million dollars for a new 
school this year, but last years large grant of the 
W. L. Mellon foundation is being used efficiently 
to develop Carnegies school for bosses. A 
handful of student guinea pigs will be the first 
graduates in June.
Last year a marketing class polled student 
opinion about the bookstore: this year we have a 
new store and the poll has changed to world gov
ernment.
Progress? We think so.
An Example
With the announcement that many of the sug
gestions made in ODK pledge papers are being 
translated into constructive action by the admin
istration and student organizations, we believe 
it is time the members of the senior men's hon
orary be given the commendation they desirve.
The organization, as it operates on this cam
pus, ean be held as an example to any in the 
country. Membership in the organization is not 
only recognition for past achievement, but far 
morean invitation to perform greater service to 
the campus. The preparation of pledge projects 
which analyze and propose solutions to campus 
problems is an example of what ODK expects of 
its members.
At least three ot last years propects have 
been fully developed and are or were in operation 
on campus this year. These are: Campus Chest, 
class organization, and the revised Carnegie Day 
program as well as other modifications of Home
coming.

Tartan Hears Afterthoughts 
On World Federalist Poll
Editor, the Tartan:
On behalf of the members of the Tech 
chapter of the United World Federalists,
I wish to express our gratitude for the 
coverage given to our poll in the Tartan 
of February 21. The front page artiele, 
the cartoon, and the editorial, all dealing 
with the problem of federal world gov
ernment, indicate a seriousness of purpose 
and a fairmindedness which are a credit 
to the Tartan as a college newspaper.
Nevertheless, as a convinced world fed
eralist I wish to take issue with several 
points raised in the editorial. You noted, 
entirely correctly, that this poll does not 
speak for older and more experienced 
generations. There have been, however, 
polls of adults on this subject and they 
showed support for Federal World Gov
ernment ranging from 60% to 70%.
Sixteen States
Furthermore, 16 of our state legisla
tures have voted favorably on resolutions 
calling for Federal World Government. 
But most telling of all has been the answer 
of voters in the solid thinking states of 
Connecticut and Massachusetts. On a ref
erendum calling for the amendment of our 
constitution to permit the United States 
to join a Federal World Government, the 
vote was 11 to 1 in favor in Connecticut 
and 9 to 1 in Massachusetts93% and 
90% yes votes.
The truth is that the vast majority of 
people want peace no matter what their 
generation. Over and over again I have 
found that .is soon as a man realizes that 
a world federation plan does have a chance 
of success his support is whole-hearted.
Feasible Plan Exists
Another statement of your editorial 
that cannot go unanswered is: The means 
to establish a world government were not 
presented for approval in this poll proba
bly because neither the U.W.F. nor anyone 
else has ever formulated a feasible plan.' 
The U.W.F. mentions three approved plans 
in its 'Beliefs and Policies pamphlet and 
the most likely to succeed of these was 
presented in the Tech poll as question 8, 
to which 67% answered yes, after con
sidering arguments for and against it.
It would take too much space to dis
cuss this plan fully, but I can say that 
after careful study World Federalists (and 
most scientists too) believe that a limited 
Federal World Government is our only 
peaceful way out of the atomic arms race. 
Many feasible plans have been worked j 
out, even going so far as to suggest a j 
world eooatitution, as did Hutchins' com- j
mittee in Chicago. These are the more 
realistic because our world has many 
working models of federation.
In response to the editorial's comment 
about the size of our membership, I would 
like to point out that the Tech Chapter 
has 45 active members (an increase of 30 
over last year) and is growing fast.
Baldwin Sawyer, 
Chairman, U.W.F. Poll Committee.
(Carl L. Peterson also wrote a letter to 
us substantiating many of Mr. Sawyers 
views. However, because of lack of space 
we are unable to publish his letter.Ed.)
Editor, the Tartan:
62.325% of Birch Hall residents favor 
Inaction NOW! This is a revealing indi
cation of a startling trend discovered in a 
scientific manner while truly relaxed! 
Yes!
Results seem, apparently, indecisively 
inconclusive.
There is reason to believe that when the 
entire grad poll comes in, the trend may 
prove an undetermined percentage of Mel
lon residents NOT to favor Inaction Now.
On the other hand, Whitfield Hall is 
apparently un-coordinated, 100%. This 
may be disastrous in view of the fact that 
the situation is out of haad and polls 
could be invalid. Whitfield, to a man, 
when asked, Do you favor Inaction 
Now!? repliedstatisticallyperhaps. 
These opinions weigh heavily. Much 
depend on Birch, Mellon, and Whitfield. 
Things are at stake; but scattered. How
ever some are undecided, but with us 95%.

A JOIKS . . . Some Painting 
and Design students are reported
ly very perturbed about the OLD 
JIM stories carried by the Tartan. 
They feel that the articles are rep
resentative of artistic attitudes of 
all engineers, and that such atti
tudes indicate the complete fail
ure of the social relations pro
gram in broadening engineering 
students.
GIFTS . . . The steel plant mod

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1950TA#A1V3
S n Ss 50 Production Shapes Up
Combined Talents Create Book 
For 4Too Much Musical Revue
Quartet Of Larimer, Weinreich, Flad, Price
Author Lyrics, Score, Plot For Campus Show
Your tickets to Scotch n Sodas Too Much entitles you to a 
seat for the evenings entertainment, brought to you through the 
efforts and cooperation of actors, technicians, and creators.
Music, number upon number of melodious rhythms, is the foun
dation for Too Much. The ri-* 
diculous Agony, the wistful 
Slow and Easy, and the haunt
ing notes of Melancholy are all 
the work of Bob Larimer.
Musical Engineer
Bob had been studying music 
for ten years when he entered 
CIT in 1947; but he did not go into 
the music department. Instead, 
this junior has been carrying be
tween 60 and 70 units each semes
ter in the engineering school, and 
seems slightly confused at this 
point as to whether he is in the 
chemical engineering or math de
partment.
Though he commutes daily from 
Crafton, this amazing man has 
found time, in addition to his tre
mendous academic load, to study 
and write music, work for combos 
and orchestras throughout the city 
as piano arranger, play on the ten
nis team, and devote hours to 
Scotch n Sodalast year as ac
companist, this year as writer.
Versatile Wanderer
The author of many of the skits 
and lyrics for this years show is 
Joe Weinreich. Like his friend 
and collaborator, Bob Larimer, 
Weinreich is from the engineering 
school. He seems to have found 
his final resting place in the elec
trical department after a semes
ter or two in math and industrial 
administration.
In 1943 Weinreich struck out 
from his home in Sharon, Penn
sylvania, to seek his fortune. For 
two and a half years he trained 
and trained in the air corps cadets, 
in radio school, in radar school, 
and then in gunnery school. At 
the wars end he was vegetable 
deliverer at KesslerField, Missis
sippi.
Since coming to CIT in 1947, he 
has been active in Alpha Phi 
Omega, Beta Theta Pi, intramur
als, and the Tartan. He applied 
his writing ability to Scotch n 
Sodas need for revue-type skits 
and came up with such creations 
as The President Says No, and 
The Importance of Feeling.
Flads The Fad
Those who saw last years show 
will remember Phil Flad as the 
mad professor of the cyclotron. 
He has brought more of his magic 
to Too Much in a skit designed 
and executed by himself. Though 
^hil has been studying sleight-ofhand for seven years, it remains 
simply a hobby with him. Radio 
and theater acting are his main 
interests.
Now a junior in the drama de
partment, he came to Carnegie in 
1947 from Bloomsbujg, Pennsyl
vania. He spends his summers as 
a jockey and announcer on sta
tion WLTR in Bloomsburg.
Four Aces
The last member of the playwriting quartet, Fred Price, was 
re-elected to Student Council un
der the banner, One good term 
deserves another. Apparently 
Fred has benefited from this ex
perience, for the title of his skit 
is We Do Anything For Pay. It 
concerns itself with the graft and 
corruption of a mythical stu
dent council.
^ He is another chemical engi
neering junior with a wide vari
ety of interests. Writing heads 
the list, for he spent thirteen 
months as public relations writer 
in the Army and was on the Tar
tan staff. Tied for a close second 
are track and bridge, his other 
loves.

Arrangers Needed
Anyone interested in arrang
ing music for Too Much 
should contact Robert Larimer. 
People interested should have 
had some previous experi
ence in orchestral or chor
al arranging. An eighteen piece 
orchestra will play Larimers 
score in this years show.
CAMPUS KICKERS
Paul Conrads eyes arent on the piano. And why not? Hes 
watching Trudy Albright, Marjorie Otterman, and Joan Wilhelm 
(left to right) as they try out for the dancing chorus of Too Much. 
Anne Pearson, dance director, is also watching, but for quite another 
reason.
Television Network Invites SnS 
To Make Airwave Appearance
Too Much, Scotch n Sodas spring musical, may appear on a 
television network this fall. Dave Clark, president of S n S, an
nounced that Talent Associates Limited is producing a television pro
gram called Variety Shows, and has extended S n S an invitation
-------------------------------------------------? to have Too Much auditioned.
Variety Shows will feature 
college musicals, with collegiate 
casts, which can be adapted for 
television performances. One of 
the companys producers will 
come to Carnegie Tech to audition 
a rehearsal. If Too Much suits 
him, he will select skits and songs 
to be used on the half hour pro
gram.
Revised Stand Taken 
On Musical Production
New, different, and for everyone are the key notes of this years
Scotch n Soda show, which last week began to take definite shape.
Dave Clark, director of Scotch n Soda and president of the Board,
announced after last weeks casting of the show, that first readings
? and orchestral rehearsals will be
gin shortly before the Easter va
cation.
Because of a drama department 
ruling making it difficult for dra
ma students to take part in Scotch 
n Soda shows, a new casting pol
icy has been formulated.
Non-Drama Students 
In keeping with this years 
theme, the show will have a small
er cast than in previous years. It 
will be given in the gym on Mon
day, Tuesday and Wednesday 
nights* during Spring Carnival 
Week. Actual building, designing, 
costuming, and all other phases 
are being done by individuals out
side of the drama department un
der the supervision of the SnS 
Board members.
The Board is made up largely of 
senior drama students who have 
been active in previous shows. 
They are attempting to put the 
job of producing the show into the 
hands of non-drama students. In 
this way they hope to provide a 
trained nucleus of workers for fu
ture shows.
Life At Carnegie 
This year the revue features 
musical comedy skits of life at 
Carnegie. Each skit is a story in 
itself and all groups, even Student 
Council, 4-factor geniuses, and 
college presidents come in for 
their share of the fuun.
Bob Larimer, who wrote the 
music, promises to satisfy every 
taste with mock opera, hill-billy 
and a new pep song for Carnegie 
Tech.
Workers Needed
It isnt too late to join SnS 
production crews. Freshmen and 
sophomores are especially urged 
to join this year so that they 
can get some Scotch and Soda 
background for more responsi
ble positions in the future.
Students who have not an
swered the first calls for cos
tume, scenery, business, public
ity, lighting, and properties work 
can do so by contacting Scotch 
and Soda through interschool 
mail. Complete school address, 
previous experience, and job 
preferences should be included.
The Scotch and Soda board 
will find plenty of work for 
every student who wishes to 
work regardless of experience. 
However, the board Is especial
ly interested in those students 
who have had experience in 
high school or other productions.
To the City
In the fall members of the cast 
will go to New York City three 
days before the program date. 
During these days the skits will be 
adapted for television and re
hearsed. All expenses for partici
pating students will be paid by 
Talent Associates.
Mr. Moss Hart of Winged Vic
tory fame, will be master of cere
monies for the program. Mr. Bern
ard Hart, one of the producers of 
the series, has produced such 
Broadway hits as Dear Ruth, 
Light Up the Sky, and Christo
pher Blake.
Definitely Interested
An airmailed reply has been 
sent to Talents Associates stating 
that Scotch n Soda club of Car
negie TecTi is definitely interested. 
Too Much is scheduled to go in
to rehearsals shortly before the 
Easter vacation. Mr. Hart will 
probably audition one ok the April 
rehearsals.
SCOTCH AND SODA S FOUR SMILING AUTHORS
A broad hint of whats to come adorns the faces of the originators 
of Too Much. They are, from left to right, Phil Flad, Bob Larimer, 
Fred Price and Joe Weinreich (standing.) Larimer wrote the musical 
score, while the remaining three collaborated with him to write 
scripts and lyrics.

F. Lunt Recommends 
Pat-on-the-backGroup
Dean Of Men Given Control 
Over International Club
Since Council doesnt get complete coverage from the Tartan, 
we should have a pat-on-the-back committee to inform students of 
our accomplishments instead of having them hear of what we havnt 
done, claimed Fred Lunt, new chairman of Student Councils plans
?-----------------------------------------------------and programs committee.
Following a long debate on 
whether Carnegies Student Coun
cil should be a legislative or rep
resentative body, the motion to 
appoint the committee was defeat
ed. Dick Holl commented that, a 
good Council doesnt need a public 
relations committee. If it finds 
projects on its own, others will do 
the patting.
Holl Appointed Chairman
The International Relations 
club was placed under the juris
diction of the Dean of Men, since 
Council has no control over local 
chapters of national organizations. 
Councilman Holl was appointed 
chairman of the publications com
mittee, which investigates the ed
itorial policy, budget, and opera
tions of each campus publication 
and acts as a jury for internal dis
putes.
Until the Scot starts to make 
money, it will be left under the. 
control of the minor publications 
board. Cano will not ba permitted 
to print an issue until it submits a 
constitution.
At the first meeting of this se
mesters plans and programs com
mittee, it was decided to investi
gate the method of presentation of 
keys for school service. Chairman 
Lunt believed that the keys were 
not being awarded according to 
the constiution by-laws.
 . . . read the Tartan
If Council had a committee to 
draw suggestions from the stu
dents and let them know of its 
work, it would be a much more 
representative body. Lunt added, 
The people who criticize Coun
cil are those who refuse to read 
the Tartan. They do not know that 
they are permitted to come to 
Council meetings and present 
their problems.
Using a bulletin board as a 
means of communication between 
the governing and student bodies 
was suggested. A summary of each 
meeting would be placed there, 
and any student wanting to regis
ter a complaint might use this 
board for that purposes. Also a list 
of councilmen would be posted so 
everyone would know their repre
sentatives.
Skibo
[Continued from page 1] 
rently in the limelight, such as 
Homecoming queen, king of hearts, 
or honorary organization.
Cover Floor
In addition, the project calls 
for the covering of the floor to 
increase its attractiveness, reduce 
noise, and facilitate cleaning. The 
small window panes would be re
placed by larger ones to eliminate 
the factory look.
Slight changes in furnishings 
were also suggested, such as the 
addition of display cases for stu
dent works, covering of waste bar
rels, redesign of posts, beams, etc. 
Plans for the coffee shop would 
be similar except for ceiling and 
floor changes.
Music by Muzak
Another welcome addition pro
posed was the installation of Music 
by Muzak to provide for continual 
recorded music in place of the 
intermittent blares of noise which 
emit from the present juke box.
The project has also worked out 
the details for the realization of 
the painting of murals. Subject 
matter would be chosen by a stu
dent poll and a specific theme de
cided on by student vote.
Interested P&D students could 
submit sketches on the chosen 
subject and the winning sketch 
selected by a board of judges from 
the student body.
Wes Kennys plan discussed 
further the adequacies of various 
materials in regard to durability, 
attractiveness, and economy.
Carnegie Teeli 
Wins Respect 
At Art Show
Students And Faculty 
Capture Many Prizes
One hundred forty-eight of the 
215 artists exhibiting works in the 
Associated Artists show held at 
the Carnegie Institute were fac
ulty members, former students, 
graduates, or students of CIT.
These Carnegie artists account
ed for 251 of the shows 4004 ex
hibits.
Balcomb Greene, professor of 
history of art at Carnegie Tech, 
won the Associations first prize in 
oils. Sidney Simon and Louise 
Pershing, former students of CIT, 
won the second and third prizes in 
oils, respectively. Norman Rosfeld, 
art editor of the Tartan, also ex
hibited a work in oil.
The Henry Posner Prize for oils 
was awarded to Irene Waichler 
Pasinski, a graduate of Carnegie, 
and the Carnegie Institute prize 
in sculpture was won by Henry 
Bursztynowicz, also a graduate of 
CIT.
In all, the Carnegie artists won 
19 prizes.
CIT Receives 
Army Contract
Students Will Be Used 
For Rhythm Studies
The relationship between 
rhythm and timing and coordina
tion will be studied at CIT under 
an Air Force contract just receiv
ed.
Dr. Joseph Weitz, associate pro
fessor of psychology and educa
tion at Carnegie, is director of the 
project, which will run about a 
year. ^
We all say that some people 
are better coordinated than 
others, Dr. Weitz pointed out, 
but the purpose of this project is 
to determine why.
We think that possibly rhythm 
and timing have something to do 
with coordination, he added. 
That is, those people who have a 
good sense of rhythm might be 
the ones with good coordination.
Dr. Weitz will use college stu
dents in his prelimm^ty studies, 
and later may use air force per
sonnel.
According to the Carnegie psy
chologist, the results of the experi
ments might help in determining 
tests for industrial or military po
sitions requiring high degrees of 
coordination.

Pershing Rifles Unit 
Formed At Carnegie
Dr. R. Mehl
Receives New 
Honor At CIT
Dr. Robert F. Mehl, director of 
the Metals Research Laboratory 
and head of the metallurgical en
gineering department has been 
appointed a member at large of 
the National Research Council of 
the National Academy of Sci
ences. The appointment is for 
three years.
A graduate of Franklin and 
Marshall College, Dr. Mehl re
ceived his Ph.D. from Princeton 
University in 1924.
Before joining the Carnegie fac

sion of Physical Metallurgy of the 
Naval Research Laboratory and 
assistant director of research for 
the American Rolling Mill Com
pany.
A unit of the Pershing Rifles, 
national basic ROTC honorary, has 
been formed at Carnegie. It is 
Company A of the Fifth Regi
ment covering Maryland and 
Pennsylvania and replaces Syra
cuse University.
The main purpose of Pershing 
Rifles is to provide extra drill for 
its members. Because of this drill, 
most units are called upon to act 
as color guards in parades.
In the spring Company A will 
try to send a special drill squad 
to a two-day regimental drill 
competition at Lehigh University. 
A rifle team is also being formed 
for regimental competition.
Captain of the company is Alan 
J. Blotcky; John N. Montstream is
1st Lieutenant; Harry F. Osterman, S-l; John Kijowski, S-2; and 
James W. Lenk, S-3 and S-4.
Harry N. Ceranowicz is sergeant, 
and the other members are Gustav 
Anderson, Alfred Bader, Bernard 
Cohen, Robert Dushaw, Enoch 
Frankhouser, Robert Lechner, Jo
seph McElhaney, Raymond New
man, and Donald Moses.
The faculty adviser is Major 
Hall.
The Pershing Rifles can be rec
ognized by the blue and white 
braid on the left shoulder of their 
uniforms. Pledges will be accepted 
later in the spring when they can 
be observed on the drill field.

P &D Brightens 
Up Oak Hall
Nursery SchoolJ
By Ivan Sturman
Do you know where Oak Hall 
is? Its on Margaret Morrison 
Street, the house with the wire 
fence, now better known as the 
nursery school. If you chance to 
pass by some night about twelve 
and see bright lights burning on 
the third floor, dont worry about 
the kiddies bedtimethe kiddies 
leave much earlier. As for the 
lights, they are the so-called day
light bulbs frequently used by 
P & Ds to reproduce daylight 
color values.
Sam Han is Oak Halls respon
sible personresponsible not onlyr 
for the use of daylight bulbs, but 
also for the daily care of the build
ing.
Hard Worker
Han, an industrial design junior, 
spends so much of his time work
ing that its difficult to understand 
how he has been able to achieve 
all the honors he. has. Serving as 
a waiter at Mellon Hall is one of 
his daily chores.
He comes closer to his chosen 
profession as a designer of drivein theaters for the Alexandria 
Theater Supply Company. These 
designs fit the basic components of 
this type of theater to the topo
graphical blueprint he receives 
with each assignment. Seven of his 
designs will be built this spring.
Honolulu claims Sam as a na
tive. Han vividly remembers the 
1941 raid on Pearl Harbor. As he 
was watching it from his home, 
a bomb demolished a schoolhouse 
in his block. There we were, 
foolishly looking for bomb frag
ments, souvenirs when we should 
have been looking for shelter.
8 Day Week 
Shortly after that he started 
working, and until 1943 worked 
56 hours weekly while attending 
high school 4 hours a day. After 
graduation he worked as a civilian 
flight engineer for a year and a 
half. Although his civilian job was 
flying, Sam could not pass the 
physical for army induction.
Impressed by what he had read 
of Carnegies Industrial Design 
School, Han came here in 1946, 
but was unable to pass his tech
nicals due to a lack of art ex
perience. Back to workthis time 
as a TWA mechanic. After a year 
and then a summer art course at 
Tech. The art course enabled him 
to start with the freshman class 
in the fall of 1947.
Many Honors 
Since then the genial host of the 
Oak Hall Culture, Classics and 
Coffee Conference has proven his 
worth by winning (1) the Henry 
L. Porter Prize annually awarded 
to the individual in the depart
ment showing the most progress: 
(2) a scholarship to the 1949 
Seminar of International Students 
Friends at Woodstock, Illinois, as 
one of four representing the Uni
ted States; (3) Carnegie scholar
ships for two years; (4) member
ship in Tau Sigma Delta, the ar
chitecture and allied arts honor
ary.
During his 'sophomore year his 
factor was one of the highest in 
his class.
Made Survey
The last time he visited his 
home in Honolulu, he wrote and 
photographically illustrated A 
New Ingredient In a Melting Pot. 
a survey of the sociological effects 
of the influx of Negroes into 
Hawaii. This treatise was awarded 
the Martin B. Leisser prize for the 
most constructive summer activity 
of his class.
Amazingly. w7ork and school do 
not use up all of Hans energy. 
This is his third year in both 
Teknon and the Mens Glee Club. 
Hes president and secretary re
spectively of these organizations. 
While WCIT was broadcasting, his 
interest in and knowledge of sym
phony and opera allowed him to 
run a weekly evening show fea
turing such music. Last, but not 
least, among his extra-curriculars 
for the last two years is Betsy 
Fry, senior foods and nutrition 
major.

6TA4MfcAIVTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1950
Not to be crowded from the spotlight by Mel Cratsleys 
talented basketeers, Carnegies current swimming crew has 
come up with the most startling of all performances in the 
athletic picture of the year.
With a decided lack of depth in material and a quite 
noticeable want of experience in some departments, the Tartan 
mermen figured to take two, perhaps even less, of their nine 
meet schedule when festivities opened in January. Since that 
time the results which have been pouring from the scoreboards 
have been almost unbelievable.
Everything seemed in order for a brief period while Slip
pery Rock nailed down a decisive win, but the prophets started 
to frown as Case Tech fell before the Plaid. Powerful Westminster 
found themselves victims of the Carnegie swimmers, and the 
locals had apparently caught the spark which has ignited more 
than one Tartan team recently.
Losses to the powers of Ohio, Kent State and Fenn, stop
ped the uphill battle temporarily, but Washington & Jefferson 
and Grove City were downed while Oberlin squeezed in a 
victory between the two. All of which adds up to a .500 mark 
to date and high hopes of winding up on the winning side of the 
ledger.
A tribute to the Avizardy of likeable Coach Claude Sofield, 
the Swimming Tartans are the surprise team of the season. 
Following in the footsteps of their basketball counterparts in 
this respect, their showing has been even more impressive than 
that of the hardwood squad.
The developments are even more surprising in light of last 
years proceedings. With a seasoned team, including an abund
ance of depth in all but one style, the Plaid had to be con
tented with a so-so season. Even the unbeatable Dave Luekey 
and a strong crew of divers could not salvage the winning 
season which the squads followers hungered for.
But now with weaknesses in every department except the 
free style event, the very one which held back the victories last 
year, they have come up with a winner.
Without question the ace of the crew is the amazing 
sophomore speedster, Nick Demas. As cool and collected as 
the aforementioned Luckey was nervous as the race approach
ed, Demas has been the mainstay and chief point getter for 
coach Sofield. Not the unbeatable performer that the famed 
breast stroke was, he has been a threat against the best of 
swimmers.
Despite all this, the most notable contribution to the recent 
wins must go to a powerful freshman who entered school this 
winter from the Navy. Dick Kramer, a Pittsburgh product, 
has been a decided aid in the 220-yard free style and the 
relay race. A one time back stroke ace, the ex-Ursinus and 
Villanova student, is blazing a trail which will be hard to fol
low even though handicapped by a minimum of conditioning.
Two freshman divers, John Beck and Roger Evans, how
ever, have provided more than their share of the surprises. 
With graduation and withdrawals taking all of the experienced 
men from last years diving division, the outlook was far from 
bright when practice sessions opened.
These two yearlings, though, have been perhaps the most 
rapidly improving duo of any of the local crew. Taking advantage 
of the fact that the University of Pittsburgh divers make use 
of the Carnegie pool for practice purposes, Beck and Evans have 
picked up valuable information from these more experienced 
competitors.
Tomorrow afternoon will tell the tale as far as the hopes 
for a winning season go. A final meet with Allegheny, post
poned since February 11, closes matters prior to the champion
ships. The meet rates as a tossup, but the notoriously slow 
pool in the Skibo gymnasium may throw the victory to the 
Plaid. There is no question, however, that the Tartans will b<* 
forced to go all out if they are to take the win away from the 
blue and gold visitors and be able to carry a winning record 
into Saturdays affairs.
Saturday, of course, marks the official end to the tri-state 
collegiate swimming year. With the staging of the gigantic 
Penn-Ohio championships at the Carnegie pool will come the 
lose to a host of individual swimming careers.
Carnegies tankers, who captured third spot last winter, 
ive little hope of coming out on top, but once again should 
ore than hold their own against the toughest of competition 
 eh they will face.
Only one of the Plain entrants, Tom Cook, will be closing 
local showing, w7hic*h points towards a highly promising 
aaon by the time next January rolls around.
Carnegie Basketeers Defeat 
Panthers, Indiana State Easily
Hilary Holste Runs WildAs Teachers Bow To Tartans; 
Matsey Sparks Local Offense in Home Finale With Pitt
By Fred Lunt
Carnegie Techs hot and cold 
cage team managed to defeat the 
University of Pittsburgh last Wed
nesday evening by a 66-59 margin, 
but not before the unpredictable 
Panthers had thrown a scare into 
the favored Tartans.
Leading by 21 points midway 
in the second half, the Plaid fig
ured to slaughter their Oakland 
rivals by a more lopsided count 
than they did in their first meet
ing this year. However, the visit
ing Pitts had other ideas and, with 
three minutes left to play, had 
cut the margin to a mere two 
points.
What happened in those final 
three minutes is still a little ques
tionable but, when the smoke had 
cleared, the Plaid was on the long 
end of the score and the oncedominant Panthers had to go back 
to their skyscraper smarting under 
their thirteenth loss in sixteen 
games.
Close-Checking Aids Panthers
Action in the early part of the 
fracas was relatively slow, as the 
Panthers played control basketball 
and bothered the Plaid with their 
close-checking tactics. With ten 
minutes gone the Tartans held a 
slim 15-13 lead and had failed to 
completely solve the Pitt defense.
At this point the tempo of the 
game picked up and the Skibos 
rolled to a 32-19 haftime advan
tage. They continued to dominate 
play in the early part of the sec
ond half and, after the first five 
minutes, had increased the margin 
to 40-19.

Sophomore center Hilary Holste paced the Tartan cage team
to its twelfth victory of the season against eight defeats as the
Plaid stopped a fighting Indiana Teachers five, 60-49, last Saturday
night on the losers floor.
Holste, showing brilliant form, 
captured high scoring honors as 
he tallied seven of ten field goal 
attempts and one shot from the 
foul line for a total ' of fifteen 
points.
Jack Riehl and Jot Matsey, con
tinuing their accuracy of previous 
games, shared second place in the 
scoring parade with twelve and 
eleven points respectively. 
Theodore Relinquishes To Holste 
Captain Mike Theodore failed to 
exhibit his form of the past week, 
as the Indians ran up an early 
8-4 lead. With three personal fouls 
called against him in these early 
minutes, Mike was replaced by 
the 63 Holste, who proceeded to 
score ten points in the first two 
periods to pace the Tartans to a 
24-22 halftime lead.
Failing to regain the lea-i dur
ing the second half, the Teachers 
trailed by as much as twelve 
points during the remainder of 
the fracas.
The Tartan five tallied 22 out 
of 49 field goal attempts, while the 
Indians hit for only 16 of 45 trys 
at the basket. Foul-line accuracy 
netted the local quintet a good 
portion of their points as they reg
istered 16 of 25 free throws. The 
Teachers could net only 17 of 33 
attempts.
Close, But Not out
Despite the large number of 
fouls called against the Plaid, no 
players were forced to leave the 
game. Bianchi, Craig, Matsey, and 
Theodore each went the limit with 
four personal fouls apiece.
With the loss of such key men 
as Theodore, Riehl, and Matsey 
at the end of this season, Holstes 
improved play is an encouraging 
sign of future successful seasons. 
He will undoubtedly see more acHilery Holste
New scoring find
The Panthers began to come 
alive at this point, playing the 
Scots on even terms for the next 
five minutes. With the scoreboard 
reading 51-30, the Pitt five started 
to move. Led by Cecconi and McCrossin, the Panthers narrowed 
the gap to 56-54 with three min
utes to play.
Riehls Exit Hurts Tartans
The exit of Jack Riehl via the 
personal foul route with eight 
minutes left seemed to unglue 
the Skibos, and Cecconi had a field 
day stealing the ball and passing 
to McCrossin for layup shots.
With two and a half minutes 
remaining, Cecconi received his 
fifth foul and the Panther rally 
fell short, as the Plaid calmly 
sank enough free throws to win.
Probably the biggest factor in 
the Tartan victory was the great 
play of Joe Matsey. The 6'3" for
ward played what was undoubted
ly his best game of the season, 
meshing 14 points and performing 
brilliantly under the boards.

Penn-Ohio Swim Title 
Decided On Saturday
Tartan Sivimmers Face Allegheny
In Dual Meet T omorroiv Afternoon
Carnegie Tech s off again-on again mermen will rub elbows 
with the classiest competition in the area as they strive for their first 
Penn-Ohio championship victory next Saturday at the Tech pool.
Though the Tartans have never won the classic, they have man
aged to make a better than exV
pected showing on each occasion. 
Last year the locals placed third in 
the seven team meet, which was 
won by the perennially strong 
Slippery Rock Teachers. Alle
gheny placed second in the con
test.
Results Expected
If anything, Tech should make 
a better showing this year. Nick 
Demas, the fleet Tartan who broke 
two records in last years meet, 
will be ready for action again. In 
addition the locals will rely heav
ily on the talents of A1 Macey and 
Dick Kramer. The latter, absent 
from competition during the past 
semester, has raced circle saround 
his rivals in recent free-style 
events.
Slippery Rock is having another 
good season and may be in shape 
to take their second straight PennOhio victory. The Rockets swamp
ed Tech in their recent meet. Oth
er contenders for the title include 
W-J, Allegheny, Case, LockHaven, Edinboro, and Westmins
ter.
Allegheny First
Claude Sofields boys will have 
a spirited warm-up contest for the 
big meet when they meet Alle
gheny this Wednesday. Allegheny 
was runner-up in last years 
championship. The Hilltoppers 
were scheduled to meet Tech two 
weeks ago, but unfortunately their 
bus broke down on the way to 
Pittsburgh and the meet was post
poned.
Admission is free for the cham
pionships, the final heats of which 
will be run at 3 p.m. on Saturday, 
March 4.
Fifty Track 
Enthusiasts 
Greet Halferty
More than fifty track and field 
enthusiasts turned out at the first 
meeting of the 1950 Carnegie Tech 
track team, held last Wednesday 
in the gymnasium. Of the fifty 
candidates, ten are newcomers to 
the sport at Carnegie.
Although it is far too early to 
make any definite predictions, vet
eran coach Guy Halferty has ex
pressed conservative hopes of 
fielding a slightly better than 
average team this year.
Of course much depends upon 
the ability of the newcomers to 
replace the Tartan standouts of 
last year who have graduated, 
particularly the brilliant sprint 
star Ernie Cassler. It is hoped 
that Jim Andrews, former standout 
at Geneva College, will regain his 
previous form and become even 
more of a standout at Carnegie.
With cold weather prohibiting 
any outdoor work, the Plaid thinclads are limited to conditioning 
exercises in the gymnasium at 
present. Coach Halferty hopes to 
enter as many men as possible in 
the A.M.A. meets to be held March 
11 and March 25.
Cage Season Closes 
With Plaid On Road
Now certain of a winning season Carnegies rebounding basket
ball five has rolled into the final week of the spasmodic season with 
high hopes of bettering their mark.
. With visits to Grove City and potent Westminster the Plaid 
quintet will close the cover on one*----------------------------------------------------
of the most exciting and fruitful 
campaigns in the recent history of 
the local campus.
Coach Mel Cratsleys proteges, 
apparently recovered from their 
second semester collapse, have reJ turned to early season form in 
whipping Pitt and Indiana State.
Grovers Should Be Easy
Their previous 65-47 victory 
over the somewhat hapless Grove 
City squad gives promise of an 
extension of the streak to three 
gameXomorrow night. The Crim
son team will, of course, have the 
added advantage of their home 
floor in the rematch, but are to 
Vweak on paper to rate a favorites 
roll.
The Tartans swept both ends of 
the home and home series during 
the past two years. It was in the 
last engagement on the Wolve
rines floor that Big Mike Theo
dore had the most successful night 
of his four year career with a near 
record output of 33 points.
Doomed to a losing season already, Coach James C. Loveless 
' five will undoubtedly be listed as 
the leading candidates for the roll 
of the Plaids 13th victim by game 
time tomorrow night.
Home-Floor Favorites
Saturdays finale will match the 
Tartans with the towering titans 
of Westminster. With one deci
sive win over the Plaid and a 
mark of some sixty odd straight 
I, victories on their home floor, the 
?New Wilmington delegation can 
be nothing by the favorite.
In a similar situation last spring. 
Carnegie gr the Titans a scare
before submitting to a 59-55 loss. 
Now, however, the veteran men
tor, Grover C. Washabaugh, is 
awaiting the Scots onslaught and 
has not underestimated the threat 
which the locals present.
Three Plaid hardwood greats 
will officialy close their careers in 
the Westminster battle. The in
valuable Jack Riehl, the ex-scor
ing ace Mike Theodore, and sharp 
shooting Joe Matsey write the 
closing chapters of their respec
tive stories in their bow outs this 
week-end.

Intramural Board Assembles 
Constitution; Change Voted
With their constitution now officially assembled, the Intramural 
board prepared to review its contents and attempt to clarify the 
situations surrounding the program and its functions.
Another amendment was added to the official law last Tuesday 
when the thirteen man body vot-'f 
ed unanimously to allow relaxa

regard to faculty teams. All fac
ulty teams which do not meet the 
necessary requirements for com

future.
Prior to the semester recess, the 
board addressed a letter to the 
school authorities requesting action regarding renovation of the 
athletic fields on the cut.
No definite results have been 
forthcoming, however, and inves
tigations have been carried on. It 
is expected that some official word 
will be released soon.
The Managers Club under the 
ladership of president Jack Bishop 
is, on the other hand, making the 
preparations for the Intramural

Coach Claude Sofields proteges 
racked up an easy 50-24 conquest 
of the Jaymen on Wednesday 
dropping only three first places.
Kramer, Macy Lead Carnegie
The visitors from Washington 
jumped into the lead with a 
victory in the medley relay, but 
Dick Kramer and A1 Macy copped 
first and second places in the 220 
yard free style and the Plaid clung 
teneciously to their lead.
Nick Demas netted two firsts in 
the 50 and 100 yard dashes to send 
the olcal crew away into the lead. 
John Beck and Roger Evans placed 
one-two in the diving, but it was 
not until A1 Macy breezed in to 
win the 440 yard free style that 
the meet was cinched.
Coach Sofield pulled his aces, 
Demas and Kramer, from the fi
nal fre style relay, but the four 
man group of Tom Freeman, Tom 
Astle, Bill Slowik, and Gene Sap
per brought home another first 
place.
Oberlins powerhouse proved 
too much for the inexperienced 
Carnegie team, however, and had 
little tx'ouble scoring a decisive 
46-29 win.
Yeoman Get Record-Happy
Four all time pool records fell 
simultaneously with the Yoemens 
win. The two longer free style 
events, the 220 and 440, were 
blasted by Kinsey, while the 
medley and the breast stroke 
events also found new times reg
istered for them.
In less than 24 hours the sea
sons mark was all even again as 
the Plaid invaded Grove City and 
came back with a 37-29 win.
The Grovers, playing the per

the eight events.
TARTAN DIVER
Roger Evans, Carnegie diver, 
executes a swan dive in the swim

last Friday afternoon.
0:26.6 was enough to take the 50 
yard dash and his 0:59.0 easily 
netted him first in the 100 yard 
event.
Kramer nailed down the 220 
yard free style in good fashion 
and Macy railed to a 5:57.0 mark 
in the gruelling 440 yard mara
thon.
Allegheny On Tap For Tomorrow
The fifth and final victory cred

Baum's 16 Points Paces Tartans
The feminine version of Carnegies basketball Tartans went 
down to defeat in their season lidlifter before a strong PCW six 
by a 38-36 score on February 19.
In a seesaw battle the Plaid team saw the victory slip from their
hands by a scant two point mar-'*

Architects Design 
Community Church
A church is not only a place for Sunday worship, but an integral 
part of the community, as well.
Students of architecture at Carnegie Institute of Technology 
learned this recently while designing a Presbyterian church group
for a mythical community of 20,-*- 
000.
They were designing the church 
group as a class project in the 
Carnegie architecture department, 
and the results of their work show 
a church design, which is begin
ning to dot the American scene.
Meet Many Requirements
In doing research for their proj
ects, the Carnegie students learned 
that parishioners look to the 
church for worship service, for 
church school and young peoples 
training, for recreation and, in 
some cases, for education. So the 
church, or, more properly now the 
church group, should be designed 
to meet all of these requirements.
The Carnegie students each de
signed a church group which they 
feel fits the needs of a small com
munity. The group, as assigned, 
was to include a 700-seat church, 
a 200-seat chapel, 10 classrooms, 
a recration hall and a home for 
the minister.
Classrooms Included
Recognizing a growing tendency 
for Protestant churches to under
take school training, the ten class
rooms were resigned for Sunday 
School, but were arranged for easy 
conversion to parochial school use.
The church group by Eugene P. 
Bittinger includes all of the ele
ments necessary in the small com
munity churchsanctuary, chapel, 
classrooms, recreation hall and 
manse  and includes also many 
features which are new.
Like Spot Light
Bittinger has put a skylight in 
the church to light the chancel. 
This skylight is designed to give 
the same focusing effects in a 
morning service that a spot light 
would be an evening service.
The Carnegie architecture stu
dent has provided also for a large 
amount of natural light by plac
ing tall glass sections at the top of 
the church. He has, however, de
signed these glass panels so that 
all light will come from the back 
of the church and no light wil] 
shine in the eyes of the congre
gation.
Parking Area
Some of the other important de
mands of a congregation have been 
met by providing a large parking 
area in the rear of the church and 
a cloak room at the entrance.
The ministers home is a sepa
rate unit, with access through a 
quiet garden area to his office and 
the church building.
All of the elements of the group 
are designed for separate use. In 
other words, any unit, such as the 
recreation hall or chapel, can be 
used without opening or heating 
the other units of the group.
Forty Per Cent 
Social Workers 
Earn Over $3900
More than 40 per cent of Car
negie Techs department of social 
work graduates answering a re
cent survey are earning over $3900 
a year, Professor Mary C. Burnett, 
head of the department, announc
ed today in an alumni news let
ter.
The survey showed 80 per cent 
of the graduates making over 
$3000 annually. Of this number, 
2.6 per cent have incomes of $6000 
or more. The number of polled 
graduates in the $3900 to $6000 
class has increased 3 per cent since 
a similar survey in 1948, and 9 
per cent since a 1947 survey.
Engineers Get 
1000 Dollar
Fellowships
Two Latin Americans 
Receive Matthes Award
Two 1000 dollar fellowships for 
one year of graduate work in en
gineering were awarded last Fri
day to natives of Mexico and Peru 
by the Albert J. Matthes Foun
dation.
The fellowships, given annually 
to Latin Americans in the interest 
of inter-continental friendship and 
unity were awarded to Rene Saul 
of Mexico and Edilberto Vega of 
Peru by Dr. J. C. Warner, Dean 
of Graduate Studies and Vice 
President of Carnegie.
Saul, a 23-year-old electrical 
engineer, will do advanced work 
in that field. He is a native of 
Mexico and plans to return to 
his country after completing his 
work here. Formerly with RCA 
Victor Mexicana and with the 
Westby Geophysical Corporation, 
he has done experimental work 
with receivers, short wave trans
mitters, and audio equipment.
Having worked with the engi
neering firm which is currently 
plant near Lima, Peru, Vega will 
engage in advanced work in civil 
engineering. A native of Lima, he 
has had experience with the De
partment of Public Works and the 
Division of Sanitary Projects in 
addition to his work with Christiani and Nielson, an international 
engineering and construction firm 
with headquarters in Denmark.

Intercollegiate Broadcasting 
System Marks Anniversary
February 19, 1950 marked the tenth anniversary of the establish
ment of the Intercollegiate Broadcastiny System (IBS). From small 
beginnings, the system has grown in the past decade to include 73 sta
tions from coast to coast with combined staffs of over 3500 students.
Although established and oper-*--------------  --------------------------:--------
ated by college students, with a 
minimum of outside assistance, the 
system has in recent years won 
the acclaim of industry, govern
ment, and educational leaders 
alike as a much needed training 
ground for the broadcasting indus
try.
Each year hundreds from these 
stations graduate into jobs in the 
radio field, and thousands of IBS 
alumni are now found scattered 
throughout the country with sta
tions, agencies, and representa
tives. Many have already attained 
positions of some prominence and 
responsibility.
Non-Profit Organization
IBS was founded by a conven
tion of student delegates from 12 
colleges who met at Brown Uni
versity on February 18-19, 1940. 
It is a non-profit organization, es
tablished to pool the resources of 
campus confined radio stations 
and further the development of 
college radio. It is controled en
tirely by the member stations and 
financed by their annual dues. The 
administrative personnel of IBS 
includes undergraduate members, 
faculty advisors, and alumni of 
stations within the system. The 
board of directors consists of a 
number of individuals well known 
in broadcasting and educational 
^circles.
Among the services which IBS 
offers its members are: main
tenance of transcription and script 
libraries, engineering research and 
distribution of technical informa
tion, and the publication of bulle
tins, news letters, and handbooks 
on various aspects of radio. IBS 
also establishes operating codes 
and represents the stations collec
tively before advertisers, publish
ers, and government agencies.
73 Have IBS
IBS stations, through a unique 
method transmission, limit their 
broadcasting to dormitories, fra
ternity and sorority houses, and 
other places where students live. 
In these campus buildings the sta
tion can be received on an ordi
nary radio, just as any other sta
tion. IBS stations are now oper
ated by and for the students at 
73 (latest count) colleges and uni
versities throughout the United 
States. Most of these stations were 
financed and constructed by the 
students themselves, blit recently

many colleges have donated space 
and built completely equipped, upto-date studios. Many new groups 
are now applying for admission 
and, with progressive institutions 
throughout the country becoming 
interested in this form of broad
casting, IBS expects a considera
ble increase in membership dur
ing 1950. ^
Station policy and program con
tent at most IBS stations is deter
mined by the students themselves 
with a minimum of faculty su
pervision. This freedom to experi
ment, so essential in the training 
stage, is made possible by the 
unique method of transmission. As 
the programs are not heard off 
campus they do not have to rep
resent university policy and repu
tation of the institution is not at ^ 
stake each time a program goes on 
the air.
Network Operation In Use
IBS operates networks of cam
pus stations, setting them up 
wherever the concentration of sta
tions is sufficient to make net
work operation practical. In April 
1948 a group of stations in upper 
New York state inaugurated the 
Empire Network of IBS. The Em- g) 
pire Network now includes sta
tions at 11 colleges. Its success has 
stimulated the formation of net
works in other regions of the coun
try. It is anticipated that these 
networks will eventually be link
ed together and extended to oth
ers that will be formed through
out the country.
In addition to providing train
ing in all phases of radio for its 
participants, and serving its lis- J| 
teners with programs of entertain
ment and enlightenment, IBS sta
tions represent an important new 
medium  for advertisers wishing 
to reach the rich college market. 
Many established local and nation
al firms have successfully used 
IBS stations in the past.

Did j ou ever try to write a newspapereven a small one 
the size of the Plaid ? Believe us, it is quite a task, even when 
there is a group of willing workers around, but what do you 
do when your right hand man is unable to be there at the last 
minute? You never miss a true friend until he is gone, aptly 
applies in this ease-.
I am speaking, of course,' about Frank Mihelich, mainstay 
and man behind the- scenes of the Plaid staff. Frank has been 
the one who always manages to accumulate choice little bits 
of news and sage philosophy to create for all a highly enter
taining column aptly called News and Views.
Frank has been associated with the Plaid in various capaci
ties from that of general reporter to editor for the past six or 
seven years. Because of his desire to see others get the oppor
tunities T>f being editor he very graciously stepped aside and 
remains in the background. Frank also writes a small newspaper 
for the gang where he works.
Newspaper work is by no means the only interest of this 
busy man. Be Is the Evening School representative of ASME, 
past treasurer of Sigma Delta Phi fraternity, a member of Nu 
Sigma Alpha activities honorary fraternity, and Pi Delta Epsi
lon, journalistic honorary. He has received his sixth Evening 
School insignia award for extra curricular activities.
. Frank is very active on the Evening Student Council, hav
ing been its president twice, once in the 1946-47 school year 
and again the following year. He is not only very active in 
student affairs, but also keeps up a very good scholastic record.
Frank Mehelich is indeed an all-around Carnegie mana 
good example to follow in leading a fuller, more enjoyable 
academ-ie life here at Carnegie Tech Evening- School.

Mr. Roscoe Gaylor, a part-time 
mathematics instructor, recently 
retired from active duty with the 
National Guard, terminating a dis
tinguished military career. He has 
acquired many years of military 
experience, serving during World 
War Two as the commanding of
ficer of a Field Artillery Battalion 
which saw action on the European 
front.
When the war ended, he was 
made commanding officer of the 
107th F.A.B., a component of the 
28th Division, Pennsylvania Na
tional Guard. The assignment was 
a difficult one since the outfit was 
being reformed, and many of those 
who enlisted had no military ex
perience.
In a period of three years the 
107th became an efficient, well 
trained unit which has proven it
self to be on a par with regular 
Army units. This accomplishment 
is largely due to the efforts of 
Colonel Gaylor. The officers and 
men of the 107th appreciate the 
services rendered by Colonel Gay
lor.

The Air National Guard, one of 
the five United States Air Force 
Reserve components, last week 
announced, through the National 
Guard Bureau, Washington, D. C., 
that limitations on A. N. G. 
strength were lifted. This was 
done in order to bring the A. N. G. 
Units to full authorized strength 
by the middle of this year.

Plans Banquet 
For April 22
Government Spending 
Is Speaker's Topic 
For 35th Annual Feast
Joe Pacenko, APO Representative.
To Discuss Permanent Decorations
The agenda for the March meeting of Evening Student Council 
indicates that the meeting will be of importance to each and every 
member. The election of officers requires the careful consideration 
of nominees and the thoughtful selection of capable people to guide
*the organization through the next 
school year.
A number of appointments will 
be made and approved by Council 
so that the chairmen of the various 
committees will have an oppor
tunity to acquaint themselves with 
present procedures and be pre
pared to accept the responsibilities 
of office when the present terms 
expire.
Evenings Too?
President Gittens has extended 
an inviation to Mr. Joseph Peeenka, chairman of the decorations 
committee of Alpha Phi Omega, to 
discuss the possibilities of appoint
ing his organization to take charge 
of the storage and care of Coun
cils permanent decorations.
Mr. Pecenka will also inform 
Council of the various activities 
in which A.P.O. is engaged. Coun
cil may wish to delegate some of 
its committee work to A.P.O., for 
the group is reliable and capable 
of doing efficient work.
It is believed that closer work
ing arrangements between A.P.O., 
Day Student Council, and Evening 
Student Council may result from 
plans that are in the formulation 
stage.
Plans for the thirty-fifth annual 
Evening School banquet are near
ing completion. Working under the 
capable leadership of Charles Kel
ler and LeRoy Rowland, the cochairmen, the committee is func
tioning smoothly and wishes to 
make the following announce
ments.
The banquet will be held in the 
Gold Room of the Hotel Roosevelt, 
which brings back fond memories 
of many other successful banquets 
that were held there. Saturday, 
April 22 is the date reserved for 
the banquet, and tickets may now 
be purchased for this affair.
The price of admission wilf be 
$3.75 per person, and anyone who 
has ever attended one of the prev
ious banquets will consider this 
price as very reasonable for the 
entertainment and pleasure pro
vided.
The committee has been very 
fortunate to obtain the services of 
Mr. Robert C. Downie, president 
of Peoples First National Bank 
and Trust Co., for the main speak
er of the evening. His topic, very 
appropriate at this time, will be* 
the cost of government.
Details of the entertainment 
which the committee has arrang
ed are being readied for public re
lease at a future date.

St. Patrick's Dav 
Semi-Formal
After kicking over the traces at 
the last square dance a week ago, 
the social activities are beginning 
to settle down to normal again. 
This has been the second square 
dance that Evening Student Coun
cil has sponsored and the interest 
shown by those who attended was 
very gratifying to the workers 
who planned the dance.
If this is an indication of the at
tendance that can be expected at 
the semi-formal, Evening Student 
Council will be in an excellent 
position to plan another social 
event to add to the calendar this 
semester.
The semi-formal dance, with 
smooth danceable music by the 
C.I.T. Delta Upsilon orchestra, will 
start in Thistle Hall at 8:45 p.m., 
Saturday, March 18, and will 
terminate at 12:00, or at some un
known hour in the nearest bar
becue curb service stand.
This dance is Evening Schools 
annual St. Patricks Day dance, 
and is the only scheduled func
tion to be held during the Lenten 
season. Tariff will be only $2.50 
per couple, and tickets may be 
procured from Mr. McKelway in 
the registration office, members of 
the dance committee, or members 
of the Evening Student Council.

Prize Given Student 
Who Teaches HimselfNOBODY 
WHAT I tMINKBy Dolly Mitchell
Gripe, gripe, gripe! This inquir
ing reporter decided to investigate 
the strange undercurrent of unrest 
that is traveling over Carnegie 
campus. What is the source of this 
interestthe Student Council sys
tem of parking violations. Stu
dents have varied opinions as to 
the merit of this system.
Marcie Helwig, junior: I have 
heard a lot of
 ' ^ S^u^ent' ^ ^oui^-
cil take down the no parking signs 
by Margaret Morrison and Car
negie Inn. This would provide 
more parking spaces.
Following on 
the heels of this 
miss, Larry 
Camlin, freshman, said:
Student Council has a good
idea but they jlL 3CAR
should mark off
the parking
space in the lot
more clearly. I ft ^|||1|P
have been hemmed in many
times in the lot. I was tagged for 
a ticket and was I mad! On the 
whole, however, I think Council 
has a fine idea.
Tom Freeman, sophomore, was 
a little more positive in his opin
ions: I think 
Councils sys' ple shoulcJnt be 
* fined until there
over Frew 
Street. In fact, a group of students 
went to the magistrates office and ; 
he said that Student Councils ac- I 
tion in fining is illegal.
Leonard Bachman, senior, be
lieves: The
five dollar fine > / ,
the police de
partment; I dont see how council 
can enforce its fines.
Fat Kelley, sophomore, was not
worried about
|b " % the fine system: 
Council should 
just warn students, not fine 
'W them. I have to 
Wst'fa/, park every 
WSM morning in a 
driveway so I 
iggga can park my 
car near cam 
jBSffiM pus. Stuaents 
m| shouldnt be 
fined when 
there isnt any place to park; its 
not fair.

our public opinion poll.
