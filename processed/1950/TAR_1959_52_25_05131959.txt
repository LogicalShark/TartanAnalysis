My, you have been the busy one, said the friend. You t'j) 
must be exhausted.
.Maybe a trifle, said Beppo, with a brave little smile.
Know what I do when Im tired? said the friend.
Light a Marlboro? ventured Beppo.
Oh, pshaw, you guessed! said the friend, pouting.
.But it was easy, said Beppo, chuckling kindlily. When the 
eyelids drojp and the musculature sags and the psyche is de
pleted, what is more natural than to perk up with todays new 
Marlboro?
A great new smoke with better makins and a'great new ^ f 
filter! proclaimed the friend, his young eyes glistening.
Changed to keep pace with todays changing world! de
clared Beppo, whirling his arms in concentric circles. A ciga
rette for a sunnier age, an age of greater leisure and more beck
oning horizons!
Now, tired but happy, Beppo and his friend lit Marlboros and 
smoked for a time in deep, silent contentment. At length the 
friend spoke. He certainly is a beauty, he said.
You mean my 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double over

Yes, said the friend. How fast will he go? < >

recently asked Beppo Schultz.
I smoke todays new Marlboros, replied Beppo, looking up 
from his 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double overhead cam

New? said the friend. What do you meannew?
I mean the flavors great, the filters improved, the cigarette

About a year, said Beppo.
.Have you done a lot of work on him? asked the friend.
Oh, have I not! cried Beppo. I have replaced the pushrods 
with a Roots type supercharger. I have replaced the torque with 
a synchromesh. I have replaced the tachometer with a double * *

Housing Problem
Next September, as in preceding Septem
bers, a large number of entering freshman 
Will be forced to find residence off campus.
This problem is becoming incresingly 
more prominent each year, as shown by the 
fact that over 150 freshman next year will 
be without dormitory housing for the first 
semester. The completion of the new mens 
dorm in 1961 promises only a partial solution 
to this housing problem if Techs present rate 
of growth continues.
Serious Consideration
The Tartan feels that this is more than a 
minor problem and consequently demands 
serious consideration. The effect upon a 
freshman who very possibly has never been 
away from home for a long period of time, 
when forced to be separted from his fellow 
classmates and campus activities, cannot be 
minimized. Not only is a great deal of time 
wasted traveling, the opportunity of making 
friendships at Tech is lessened.
There is, however, a solution to this prob
lem which the Tartan strongly endorses. The solution: invert 
the existing dorm priority scheme; that is, give freshman top 
and seniors bottom priority in the dorms. This solution 
may at first seem unjust in that seniors will be deprived of 
their rooms to make space for entering freshman. However, 
a little honest thought should show that this is the most de
sirable and fairest of the plans available at the present time.
Students who have reached their senior year, unlike 
freshman, are already adjusted to college life. Moreover they 
are familiar with the City of Pittsburgh and a larger part 
of the seniors own automobiles. These facts would make the 
burden of living off campus much less for the senior. Further
more, even now there is a tendency on the part of seniors 
after having lived on campus for three years, to a change to 
an off campus residence. J.D.S.

Alice in Wonderland
Scotch n Soda called it a revue with a plot. I call it 
Alice in Wonderland; for this final production of the de

with Alice hopelessly attempting to tie them all together.

The play even had an overture

The overall result of Alice 
had a person caught up in the 
fanciful world of Carroll: for two 
hours he believed in the Queen of 
Hearts and the White Rabbit. In 
the stage reading, the play is not 
bogged down by numerous sets or 
costumes. With only a few props,

Best Segments 
The caucus race, Duchess kit

segments of th show. Ingenuity 
in movement and the emphasis on 
effective lines gave these scenes 
the wonderland quality they 
possessed. The tea party, however, 
because of the delightful charac
terizations by Syd Walter, Joel 
Levinson, and Lloyd Battista, was 
the fanciful high point of the play. 
Although he achieved an effective 
character, the horseplay of Jer

was overplayed.

Free Cigarettes
The author of any Letter to 
the Editor published in the 
Tartan will receive a free 
earton of Marlboro cigarettes. 
This servis has been made 
possible through Harry Desiletes, Techs Marlboro repre
sentative.
The Greek tradition has symbolized the 
two facets of mans personality in the figures 
of Apollo and Dionysius.
Apollo is associated with the intellectual 
pursuits, with music considered as mathematics, with restraint and self control. Hi$ 
counterpart Dionysius is seen as the god of 
wine, the symbol of the dance, the god whose 
esoteric mysteries are available to those who 
can lose themselves in ecstasies of wine, of 
religion, of sexual pleasure. The figure of 
Apollo is usually that of a young man of 
idealised proportion, contained and quiet, 
while Dionysius appears young and slightly 
paunchy, his eyes slightly glazed, his stance unsure. V
While the years spent in college are primarly occupied 
with the pursuit of Apollo, the total eliminations of Dionysiac 
elements from our lives would be a fatal misunderstanding 
of the balanced life which an educated man should strive to 
achieve. Without Dionysius, Apollo is helpless, self destroy
ing,-unproductive. Granted that Dionysius has been with us 
most of our lives, our perception of him is surely incomplete. 
In our youth we met the god scribbled on the walls of the 
latrines, talked of in the locker rooms, and suggested in th # 
vistavisioned broads on the movie screen, even in this, our 
maturity, he is most often found in the boasting of the after 
party parties, and after midnight, when the girls talk about 
the boys. On the other hand, while many have sought to 
rescue the god from the back alleys and Schenley Ovals; 
they have in the process given him a respectability and 
practicality which ill befits his merry nature. We see him 
dressed in a Brooks suit, standing in an imposing environ
ment reeking with status, holding an acceptable blende^ 
whiskey, and announced as a Man of Distinction. To com
plete this particular disguise he has been stood on stilts on 
Park Avenue and transformed into the most singularly Apolloian building of our area. Meanwhile, the young ladies are 
brought to an emasculated version of the god by a vigorous 
middle aged gym teacher in a school course usually entitled 
Health and Hygiene.
With this in mind, and in view of the gossip sweeping 
the campus concerning an impending era of puri'tanism for 
Carnegie Tech, it would seem that a positive program oi 
Dionysiac revival might be proposed by a society of Bachchantes, whose avowed purpose would be to rescue the great 
god from both respectability and gutterhood. The possibili
ties of such a program are vast. It will propagate those ad
vances of modern science which make his worship both safe 
and pleasurable in permitting a certain abandon without the 
fear of future involvement. It will seek to destroy serious 
and social drinking and honor alcohol as a vehicle of joy. 
It will inveigh against the inseparable twins, Sanctimony ai.J 
Smut, in whatever guise they affect. And as a practical meas
ure it will keep a small fund available to go to the aid of those 
who have become entangled, with a panic-button pushing 
administration while in celebration of the Kites of Spring.
Dionysius comes bearing a cuprunningover of pleasure, 
reminding us that release and joy are necessary to our per
fection as men. Shall we occassionally join his happy fellow
ship?

Four SB Teams Remain Unbeaten'
By PAUL SEBASTIAN
After a successful spring carnival week-end, beautiful spring weather facilitated the j 
playing of fourteen softball games last week.
There were few changes in the league standings with PKT, GSIA, and Newman Club 
tied for first in the Athletic League, and the Delts, with TDP breathing down their backs, are 
still grasping first place in the^----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yankee League. In the Senator 
League on the other hand, SN 
n^/ed into first as ATO and SAE 
both lost.
Athletic
In the Athletic League the Fal
cons tumbled deeper into the cel
lar by losing to PKT 15-9. The 
game was nip and tuck until the 
Phi Kaps pulled away in the last 
two innings. Dalcanton and Luzar 
homered for PKT, while Hurbanek homered for the Falcons.
On the same day GSIA de
lated DU to stay in the running 
for league honors. The defending 
champions, KS, after a miserably 
slow start, showed some of last 
years form in beating the Fal
cons 9-2. Goetz led KS with a 
homer and a single.
On Friday, Newman Club con
tinued its winning ways in beat
ing DU 12-5 despite a grand slam 
home run by DUs Drew.
Senator
^in the Senator League last 
Monday, the Met Grads rallied 
for six runs in the last inning to 
defeat ATO 6-3.
The next day, in a close one, 
TKN defeated PKA 7-5. Huminert homered for TKN, while 
Neubauer did likewise for PKA 
with two men on. In the big fra
ternity rivalry for the all-school 
trophy ATO convincingly whipped 
SAE 10-2, despite Gordons fieldf
[.y of two singles and a homer, 
his tightened the race consider
ably by dropping SAE from first 
place.
PKA on Thursday in their best 
outing to date soundly beat the 
Met Grads 19-6. Harrington led 
PKA to the victory with two 
home runs.
ATO - SAE
As ATO and SAE both lost last 
week, SN slipped into first place
i Friday by beating TKN 9-6. 
evensons home run helped his 
brothers to the victory. It was the 
longest home run ever hit in
intramural softball.
In the Yankee League we find 
that the Englishmen, this years 
basketball finalists are having 
similar troubles as are their arch 
rivals the Falcons. Last Monday 
they were defeated again, this 
time 7-6 in a come from behind 
spurt in the last inning by TDP. 
Bimbo Roth of TDP had one of 
his better days with three hits.
TX the next day defeated the 
Vets in a slugfest ,13-9. Elikan of 
TX had two homers while his 
teammate Kachmar also hit for 
the circuit.
TDP continued to breathe down 
the necks of the Delts by coming 
from behind with three runs in 
the sixth and one more in the 
seventh to beat BSR 7-5. Roth 
again led his team with three hits.
TX-Metals Club
On Friday the Metals Club came 
close to winning a ball game. De
spite pitcher Szuchs five hits and 
Frynckos two home tuns the 
hustling aggregation from the 
Metals Club couldnt quite catch 
up as they succumbed 10-9. Epner 
and Chalupa led TX with a home 
run apiece.

week, and the twelve top hitters

No Baseball Team Hurls Teclis 
Chances Of Retaining Trophy
Westminster forged ahead of Carnegie Tech in the battle 
for the West Penn Conference all-sports championship.
The Tartans had carried a four point lead into the spring 
sports, but the Titans have edged ahead of Tech on the 
strength of their strong baseball, tennis, and track teams.
The point totals as of May 3 found Westminster with 59 
points, Tech 58, Geneva 47, and Grove City 29. Duquesne, St. 
Francis, St. Vincent, and Waynesburg are far off the pace.
The Tech golf team also enabled Tech to pick up points 
with two victories over Duquesne and Westminster. This ex
tended Techs golf record to four wins without a defeat.
The factor that makes the Titans the favorite at the pres
ent time is that they are playing eight baseball games while 
Tech plays none. Thus Westminster has a chance to pick up 
16 points on Tech in baseball.
Tennis Team

The Carnegie Tech tennis team 
extended their win streak to four 
straight in West Penn Conference 
play by defeating Westminster 5-4 
on the losers courts. The win en
abled Tech to hold first place in 
conference tennis play with a 4-0 
mark. The loss knocked West
