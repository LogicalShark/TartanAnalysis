Dorm Residents 
Elect Officers 
For Next Year
On Monday, May 12, the resi
dents of the mens dormitories 
elected a partial slate of Dorm 
^ouncil officers to serve for the 
forthcoming school year. The new 
officers are: president, Len Cozza; treasurer, Jim Houston. The

sponding secretary, Hank Adams; 
and * property custodian, Roger 
Strauss, will retain their offices 
until the fall elections. The of

-This double-election system is 
devised to keep as many officers 
as possible in their positions un

Ottervik, Frick Break 
Records At Tri-State
Two Tartan track stars set. new tri-state records at the 
meet held last Saturday at Westminster. Tech took fifth place 
in the meet and was nosed out for fourth place by Geneva 
by one-half point. ?-----------------------------------------------
Eric Ottervik, phenomenal Tar
tan distance runner, set a new re
cord in the two mile event run
ning a fine time of 9:59.7. This 
broke the old record by seven 
seconds. Eric had run a better 
time earlier in the week against 
W&J. His time then was 9:53.5. 
This was a new school record also.
.Record Throw
The other record setter from 
Tech was Javelin thrower Joe 
Frick. He had a tremnndous toss 
of 184 feet which broke the old 
tri-state record by over 5 feet. 
This was the best toss of Joes 
career and he couldnt have pick
ed a better day for it.
Other Carnegie trackers to win 
honors were A1 Tompkins who 
took a fifth in the 100 yard dash, 
Eric Suggs with a sixth in the 
440, Bill Whitman, third in the 
half mile; John Berg with a fifth 
in the discus, and finally Dick 
Hamilton, Otterviks running mate 
who placed third in the two mile 
with a lime only (six seconds off 
the tri state record.
Other Records
Several other records were 
broken at the meet. Felton Brown, 
Westminsters famed sprinter set 
two records with a 9.5 sec. 100 yd. 
dash and a 20.9 sec. 220 yd. dash. 
Ken Hilderbrand of Slippery Rock 
set a new 440 record with a 50.0 
sec. time.
Bill Milroth, W&J sophomore, 
set two records also running the 
half mile in 156.2 and the mile in 
4:23. This young distance man is 
one of the finest small college dis
tance runners in the country.
Find Weather
The fine weather was one of the 
causes of several records being 
broken, but all the sprinters and 
distance men had been running 
fine times-all year 'and climaxed 
the season by shattering all re
cords.
Hats off to the Tech team for 
a fine performance and in par
ticular to Eric Ottervik apd Joe 
Frick whose records should stand 
for a long time.

Monthly Grant 
The aid includes a monthly cash 
grant, food, clothing, and any nec

also enabled Chung Hi to go to 
school. Although she is 13, her 
poverty during the war prevented 
her from attending school and 
therefore she is only in the fourth 
grade. However, since she started, 
she has ranked first in a class of 
seventy-eight and has formulated 
an ambition to become a school 
teacher.

Silent Generation
IM Award
Editor, the Tartan:
On Call Day this year, as in 
past years, an award was pre
sented for the Intramural Man of 
the Year. Here the similarity be
tween this award and the award 
given in previous years ceases. To 
quote last years Thistle, this
award is given because of the ath
letes participation, ability, and 
sportsmanship and his promotion 
of the Intramural program, while 
according to last weeks Tartan 
this award is given for the sen
ior who has done the most to pro
mote the Intramural sports pro
gram. The Tartan quote clearly 
describes the basis on which the 
nominees for this years award 
were judged.
This award, which until last 
3'ear was known as the Intra
mural Athlete of the Year Award 
and has recognized such fine allaround athletes as ATOs Del 
Richie and KSs Mike Pascarella, 
has now degenerated into a serv
ice award wherein a senior may 
couple an average athletic ability 
with such things an Intramural 
Board membership, making out 
playing schedules, etc., and walk 
off with the award.
Recognize Ability
Certainly work of this nature 
should be taken into considera
tion, but it should not be given 
such weight as to overshadow ex
ceptional athletic ability. Nor 
should the director of intramural 
athlctics, when explaining the 
basis on which the award is to be 
given, favor anyone who has done 
considerable work thereby making 
the job of the director of intra
mural athletics easier.
It is my hope that next year 
when the members of the Intra
mural Board and Managers Club sit aown to cnoose tne intramurai
Man of the Year, they will place 
more emphasis on participation, 
ability, and sportsmanship and 
thereby lift the award above that 
of a service award and place it 
on its former level of recognition 
of outstanding athletic ability.

Tech Golfers Show Promise
If our golfers continue at their 
present pace, the Carnegie Tech 
golf team should prove a contend
er for the West Penn Conference 
crown. These are the words of 
Bill Rogers, mentor of the Tartan 
golf team. While they may sound 
somewhat overconfident, his words 
do have merit.
This years issue of the golf 
team is very well-balanced, with
Editor, the Tartan:
The present college generation has frequently been called 
the silent generation, apathetic, dull, and old before its time. 
Several college students from Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsyl
vania, two from Carnegie members of the Eastern Midwest
College Conference of Liberal Re-4----------------------------------------------------
ligious Youth, met recently near 
Cleveland for a weekead to dis
cuss this alleged apathy.
Doctors Gregory and Jellema, 
both of the Case Institute of Tech
nology's humanities department, 
and Mr. D. Silberger, a ph\rsics 
teacher at a Cleveland area high 
school, criticized todays students 
for their lack of objective values.
Without such values to provide 
_ criteria for judgment and action 
in concrete situations, they said, 
we cannot act positively and con
structively.
No Values
Too many people are in a dilema: they have no lasting values, 
but at every moment they must 
choose to act in some way. The 
two common responses to this 
problem are conformity to the 
crowd's actions or a vague, un
formulated revolt against the 
crowda confused revolt because 
the crowd has no clear values 
either.
The notion that it doesn't mat
ter what one holds as valuable 
leads to a general don't care at
titude, which not only brings an 
empty feeling to individuals, but 
is a danger to society. The lack 
of a lasting, strong foundation of 
values leads to fear of expressing 
new ideas, or worse, to the de
struction of the individuals abil
ity, for creative activity. Under 
such conditions society could ap
proach stagnation. Aimlessness 
also leaves society vulnerable to such secularized religions as com
munism and fascism.
Discussion And Thought
Through discussion and indi
vidual thought we can try to 
recognize objestive and lasting 
values which can form a basis 
for action. We invite all those 
who care about the future of their 
society to do some sincere think
ing about their own values 
about what they believe is mo?t 
important in the long runand 
to stand publicly for these values.

Tech Tennis Team 
Finishes Season 
With 5-5 Record
Thanks to two victories over 
Duquesne last week to offset a 
loss at Pitt, Tech brought its ten
nis seasons record to an even 
5-5.
Tech won easily at Duquesne :>n 
Monday, May 12, 6-3. Strangely 
enough, the Tartans had trouble 
at the top only, losing only the 
first and second singles and first 
doubles match. Gene Krygowski 
was no match for the hard, hop
ping serve and smashing attack 
of the Dukes Dick Koscelnik, a 
veteran of tournament, and Army 
play, and easily the best college 
player in the area.
Larry Dussair had a bad day in 
being upset by Duquesnes Rudzinki, and Tom Bieg streak was 
extended to three sets in downing 
the Dukes number 3 man. Techs 
first doubles combination. Kry-gUWSM Ctrl LI L/uooan, dgctill w
Koscelnik, who hardly needed a 
partner. No one else dropped a set 
as Tech swept the rest of the 
matches.
Making up a rained-out match, 
Duquesne visited Teci. on Satur
day, May 17, to lose 6-3, again. 
Techs Krygowski played admira
bly, but was again no match for 
the Dukes stellar Kosvelnik.. Lar
ry Dussair avenged his Mondays 
upset by playing excellent driving 
tennis in whipping Duquesnes 
Rudginski, 6-0, 6-2. The Tartan's 
steady Mario Volpe, who, is a 
sophomore, has lost only 3 singles 
matches in 2 years, easily won his 
fourth singles match, as did 
George Gross and Thira Suwan, 
playing members 5 and 6 respec
tively.
Techs 5-5 record was certainly 
disappointing. This was at least 
partially due to the ineligibility of 
two letter winners, sophomore A1 
Winters, and junior Ev Crissman; 
and to the loss of the secret make
up match to Westminster when 
Techs first two men went to the 
printers picnic. On the bright side 
was the addition to the squad of 
George Gross, a junior transfer 
who played very w ell in the num; bers 3, 4, and 5 singles, and fresh| men Thira Suwan and John Oeh; ler, who looked good in the numi ber 6 singles and 3 doubles slots.
The picture is brighter for next 
' year, with a strong squad of vet| erans returning. The only graduat, ing players are Larry Dussair, 
who has been a stalwart on the 
' team for 4 years, and Kent WilI liams, a transfer student who 
, played in the 6 singles and 2 
j doubles slots this year. Returning 
are six to eight veteran letter win
ners, depending on the eligibility 
of Winters and Crissman, who 
would definitely add strength to 
the squad. The six, with their class 
and final positions on this years 
squad, are: Gene Krygowski, jun
ior, first; Tom Bieg, junior, third; 
Mario Volpe, sophomore, fourth; 
George Gross, junior, fifth; Thira 
Suwan, freshman, sixth; and John 
Oehler, freshman, eighth. The 
squad is strong in its depth, with
8 good players, rather than being 
top-heavy with a lew stars.-
Observations
Man Has True Power 
To Improve His World
By Richard Block
This is the last appearance Observations will 
make this year. It is up to the student body and the 
Tartan staff as to whether a similar type of column 
should be printed next year. I hope the answer will ' 
be positive.
When I went into the Fine Arts little theatre to 
hear the address given by J. C. Warner on Tuesday,
I anticipated discussing that lecture in this article.
I was going to say that it is only fitting that I, 
who have criticized our Presidents public absence, 
should evaluate his appearnce. I cannot do that. 
Dr. Warner appeared before us as a man, a scientist, 
with social and political opinions.
State of Campus
I.will not discuss those opinions. He did not ap
pear before us as a university president, nor has he 
ever appeared before us as the President of Car
negie Tech and spoken to us as that president. We 
all expect a state of the union from the president of 
our country. Should we be blamed for wanting a 
sort of state of the campus from Dr. Warner?
Many things go through my mind that I would 
like to talk about. I havent much space. So, I will 
say the same thing I have been saying all year.
Peace
Peace is the big issue today. The outlook is bad. 
But the solution, the only solution, lies where it has 
always lain; in man. I dont speak of mankind, I 
speak of every individual man alive in the world.
I mean myself, I mean every student at every uni
versity in the world.
Any excuse is just that, an excuse without a 
reason; and I mean any. To say, I can do noth
ing about it, is an excuse and an untruth. To say, 
I like things just the way they are, or Weve 
got everything we need here, let the Communist 
countries work out their own problems is a breach 
of integrity and humanity. For me to say follow 
the teachings of Jesus, Moses, Socrates, Gandhi, 
Francis of Assisi, Mohammed, and the many others 
who taught the right thing instead of merely paying 
lip service to Christianity might prove to be a use
less sermon.
To Look Into Truth
4-1---J.------i-L----J 1 * XL 4.---these men sought and work toward that will accom
plish a great deal. Lets i^ot go to church and pray 
beside a person who we have undercut in a busi
ness deal. Lets not blame the government or gov
ernments for the state of affairs. Lets blame our
selves. There is not a single thinking, voting in
dividual who can avoid blame for the state of 
humanity. I am here paying lip service to Christ
ianity and to all other religious morals. I mean to 
give myself to the task of living this way, of trying 
at least.
We of the senior class who are leaving Tech 
this spring have a mess of a world to work in. This 
does not excuse us from doing something about it. 
And it will never excuse us from doing something 
about it. And it will never excuse our failure to im
prove it. The solution has always lain in man and 
we are men. Within us is the solution. If we go out 
and make fortunes, establish foundations, run in
dustries, and die leaving the world as it is now, 
then we are absolute failures.
Power Lies In Man
My positiveness and optimism is strong. I feel 
positive. If the true power lies in man then there is 
nothing but man to stop us. This is a big obstacle, 
but it is humanly surmountable if, and it is a capital 
if, we really want to. If we want to badly enough 
to sacrifice, not for personal gain, but for human 
dignity and integrity and for personal dignity and 
Integrity. If we believe that humanity is a higher 
form of life than basic animal beasthood then we 
must prove this theory through action.
Self Interpretation
In the book of Genesis, in the story of Cain and 
Abel there is a passage which has been translated 
different ways in three editions. In the King James 
version the passage reads, Lord to Cain, If thou 
does well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou 
doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee 
shall be his desire, and rule over him. In the 
American Standard Bible the passage reads with 
the alterations, . . and do thou rule over ljim.* 
This is very different.
The former is a promise that Cain will rule over 
sin. The latter is a command ordering Cain to rule 
over sin.
Which is the truth? Which is the true transla
tion? The anwer, neither, Each is slanted to pre
vent the reader from understanding himself. Each 
is used to indoctrinate. Let us go to the original 
Hebrew. In the Hebrew text the word is timshel. 
This word translated into English is, thou mayest." 
Not a command, not a promise, but a choice. It 
throws the responsibility back on the individual. It 
is up to us. No one can do it for us. We may rule 
over sin and ignorance. Also, we may not.

tice of awarding trophies the 
same year they are won, and 
started a rules clinic in football 
and basketball to familiarize all 
participants with the various rules 
governing the sports. Intramural 
night was pepped up, co-rec 
sports were expanded, and the 
campus has responded warmly.
Campus participation in intramurals has jumped from 938 in
1955 to 1245 last year, an increase 
of better than four percent com
pared to the campus as a whole 
The program of 22 sports ranging 
from football to chess attracts not 
only players but also spectators, 
such as the 2000 who attended in
tramural night, the 50 who stay
ed in twelve degree weather to 
watch the city IM football cham
pionship, and the lone man who 
phoned Mr. Birdy at 2 a.m. one 
morning to find out the results of 
an intramural contest.
I liked the close association
Smedley
out by a fine Wash and Jefferson 
track team in their last dual meet 
of the season. The score was 70 
to 61.
Highlight of the meet was the 
two mile event . in which Eric 
Ottervik set a new school record 
by running the event in 9:53.5. 
The old school record had been 
held by former coach Bob Car
man.
Hamilton
Dick Hamilton, Otterviks run
ning irate also ran a fine race with 
a time of 10:02. two seconds off 
the record.
Bill Milroth of W&J set two 
new track records with a 1:58 in 
the half mile and a 4:27 mile. Both 
these times were much faster than 
any times run against the Tartans 
this year.
Joe Frick javelin thrower was 
nosed out for first place by the 
W&J man by a mere 14 inches. 
Another close event was the 440 
yard dash which was won by 
Bedek of W&J in 50.9. He nosed 
out Techs Eric Suggs by a yard.
Mile Relay
The mile relay event was close 
all the way as Tech had a six yard 
lead till Milroth took the baton 
and passed Techs third runner. 
Bedek ran fourth for W&J and 
had just enough to stay out in 
front of the Tartan anchor man, 
Eric Suggs.
This loss gove the Tartans a 5-4 
record for the season in dual 
meets. Considering the close loss 
to W&J along with the 69-62 de
feat at the hands of Geneva the 
Tartan record could easily have 
been 7-2. This years record was a 
large improemvent over last years 
and congratulations are in 
for coach Jim Farson who did a 
fine job in his first year at the 
helm.
