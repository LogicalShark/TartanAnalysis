Carnegie Tech campus. .Veterans At Tech 
Indicate Interest 
In Proposed Club
At a general meeting of the 
veterans of CIT held on February 
22 in Engineering Hall, it was 
agreed that a Veterans Club 
should be formed on campus. The 
assembly under the guidance of 
Joe Brashear, who is acting as 
temporary president of the organi
zation, took definite steps towards 
the formation of the club.
A proposed constitution was 
presented and a committee was 
formed to revise the constitution 
for approval at the next general 
meeting to be held on March 8. 
At that time it is also proposed 
to nominate a slate of permanent 
officers. Membership cards have 
been placed on sale and a large 
group of veterans seem to be 
showing an interest.
The Tech Vets Club has plan
ned their first production as a 
mixer social to be held Friday 
night, March 4 in Thistle Hall and 
the Black Cat Lounge. Members 
of the club holding membership 
cards will be admitted free of 
charge. Those who have not had 
an opportunity to purchase their 
membership cards may do so at 
the door. The Vets Club is open 
to all veteran students attending 
Tech day or night school and those 
who would like to join are invit
ed to contact Brashear or attend 
the mixer.

Pan-Hell Council 
Drafts Penal Code 
For Its Sororities
The Pan-Hellenic Council has 
passed a new penal code which 
will be enforced when a rushing 
or other Pan-Hell rule is brokeri.
The present plan for this new 
idea will be carried by a judicial 
board which will consist of a rep
resentative from each sorority. 
This usually will be the senior 
Pan-Hell representative.
The accusation will come 
through Pan-Hell. Eacl* violation 
will be brought separately as soon 
after the accusation as possible. 
The secretary of Pan-Hell shall 
keep a percnanent record of all 
cases.
The president of Pan-Hell will 
preside and present the case. The 
accuser states the case, then the 
board decides the penalty by se
cret ballot after a discussion of 
all evidence.
The penalties for a major fault 
will be deferred pledge (the quota 
of the individual sorority shall be 
lowered depending on the dis
cretion of the board) or exemption 
of social privileges. There is also 
a point system to be applied for 
minor offenses, three points equal
ing a major offense.
On Present DU Location
By Paul D. Carmichael
In a meeting with fraternity alumni representatives, faculty advisors, and active 
chapter representatives of the 12 fraternities on campus on Thursday, February 24, in the 
School for Industrial Administration Auditorium, Dr. J. C. Wagner announced the revised 
plans for new fraternity-dormitory construction. The main feature of the plan is the two
?unit duplex instead of the 
four unit quadrangle which

SC President Names Members 
To Serve On New Committees
By James J. Murphy
In keeping with the tradition of setting forth working policies 
at the beginning of a new semester, the president of Student Council, 
Si Kellman, last Wednesday outlined a number of steps which he 
feels will gain respect for the student government and which will
help Council to more adequately#-----------------------------------------------------
serve the student body.
A prime factor in Mr. Kellmans 
outline is a tightening of the 
formal and informal organization 
of Student Council. Much author
ity theoretically granted to Coun
cil by the Constitution is in fact 
held by other organizations or the 
administration. Mr. Kellman 
wishes to amend the constitution 
so as to achieve a more consistent 
and more realistic appraisal of 
Councils duties and responsibili
ties. Also, since any group is only 
as active as its members, Mr. Kell
man appealed to the representa
tives to devote time and effort to 
their various committee projects, 
and to remember that each com
mittee has an important job in 
communicating ideas to both the 
student body and administration.
Social Calendar
Other tasks for this semester in
clude the setting up of next years 
social calendar, in which an at
tempt will be made to define an 
all-school function under both 
the financial and social jurisdiction 
of Council, and the establishment 
of a committee to re-evaluate the 
Campus Chest fund allocations 
and to organize future Chest 
drives.

had been proposed before.
Active and alumni represen
tative of Beta Theta Pi, Delta 
Upsilon, and Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon have agreed to go in
to the plan and construction 
is slated to start on the first unit 
this June. The architect, Mr. 
Lawrence Wolfe, is in the process 
of drawing up specifications for 
this unit. Delta Upsilon and Beta 
Theta Pi will occupy the first 
unit which is to be built on the 
site of the present DU house. The 
new quarters are expected to be 
ready for occupancy for the fa.i 
of 1956. This means the DUs will 
have to be moved into other 
quarters for a year.
Bad Neighbors
Dr. Warner stated that the basic 
plan was changed because certain 
neighbors of Carnegie Tecfc did 
not like the first proposed location 
of the fraternity units. This was 
the property bounded by Devon 
road, Forbes street, and the pres
ent Carnegie Union. It was there
fore necessary to do another sight 
study and the duplex arrangement 
was arrived at.
The administration felt the 
property to use is the area bound
ed by Devon Road, Forbes street, 
Morewood avenue, and Morewood 
place (see sketch above) where 
most of the fraternities are pres
ently situated. Because some of 
the fraternity houses are in good 
shape and there is the problem of 
moving fraternities around when 
a unit is being built, the present 
plan is not expected to progress 
as fast as the one considered be
fore. Depending on fraternity in
terest and capabilities, this plan is 
expected to go ahead at the rate of 
one unit a year.
The second proposed unit would 
be built on the present site of the 
Alpha Tau Omega fraternity 
house.. ATO and SAE would 
occupy this unit. From all indi
cations ATO is very much in
terested and is expected to go 
along. The ATO chapter voted in 
favor of the plan last week. Most 
fraternity men feel the present 
plan is far superior to the original
ly proposed quadrangle building.
Same Floor Plans
The floor plans are basically the 
same as tiiose in the quadrangle, 
each housing 36 men, although 
each fraternity will have 150 more 
square footage per floor. Other 
features are more storage space, 
larger study rooms, and any type 
of sleeping arrangements the fra
ternity desires. It is thought these 
added improvements will boost 
the cost to approximately $120,000 
per fraternity. This does not in| elude furniture or dining room 
and kitchen equipment as these 
are up to the individual fratern
ity to provide.
Each fraternity group would 
still be required to put up $27.500 
as an initial outlay and the rest

Thirty Top Executives 
In Management Course
Thirty executives from 27 firms in 12 states and four foreign 
countries have come to Tech to begin the Program For Executives; 
a nine-week course for mature executives given by the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration.
The program is designed to de-*- ~ --------------
velop a company-wide point of 
view, to stimulate creative think
ing about human relationships in 
business organizations, and to ex%
.5?
plore the intermesh of the busi
ness enterprise and the American 
economy.
A major problem facing Amer
ican industry is the shortage of 
broadly trained men for top man
agement responsibilities according 
to Dr. G. L. Bach, Dean of the 
Graduate School. Because many 
men have accumulated most of 
their business experience in a sin
gle department, Dr. Bach said, 
they have not acquired the broad 
gauge requirements for top man
agement assignments, though they 
are already experts in one or more 
areas of administration. Carne
gies program is especially de
signed to help successful execu
tives obtain broader training for 
top-level responsonibility.
Varied Backgrounds
Admission to the program was 
limited to 30 executives. They 
were selected to assure broad rep
resentation of a variety of indi
vidual business backgrounds, types 
of industries, sizes of companies 
and geographical areas. Most of 
the participants are in their forties 
and have from ten to 25 years of 
business experience.
During the nine weeks course, 
the executive group will concen
trate on business policy, financial 
problems, human and labor rela
tions, business in the American 
economy, and new techniques and 
ideas in business.
All courses are held in the Grad
uate School of Industrial Admin
istration building and are conduct
ed on a round-table discussion 
basis. Members of the Graduate 
Schools faculty conduct the class 
sessions. Informal seminars with 
distinguished leaders from busi
ness, labor, government, and the 
sciences supplement the formal 
work of the program. Among the 
guest speakers will be Manley 
Fleischmann, former administra
tor, National Production Author
ity; Sidney A. Swensrud, Chair
man of the Board, Gulf Oil Cor
poration; Arthur Van Buskirk of 
T. Mellon and Sons; and I. W. 
Wilson, President, Aluminum 
Company of America.
Participating executives repre
sent large and small firms from 
such industries as aircraft, steel, 
electrical machinery, oil, textiles, 
banks, public utilities, chemicals, 
rubber, construction, tobacco, and 
the U. S. Department of Defense.
Administrative officers for the 
Carnegie Program are Dr. G. L. j 
Bach, Dean of the Graduate School 
and Professor D. C. Dearborn, Ad
ministrator, Program for Execu
tives.
Hillel
There will be a Hillel 
brunch Sunday, March 6, in 
the Morewood, Recreation 
room. The group will present 
a music and social hour with 
entertainment provided by 
three music students. Helene 
Shiffrin and Marcia Goldstein 
will play the piano and sing, 
while Sandy Tex will discuss 
modern Jewish folk music.

THE BULL SESSION
I wonder if they still make bull sessions the way they used 
to. Well do I remember the bull sessions of my own undergrad
uate days. How cogent they were! How informative! How the 
good talk crackled and our young hearts leaped and the hours 
sped by as swiftly as minutes!
Our discussions were always led by Jack Femur. (Good old 
Jack! I hear hes in the extruded alueiinum game now.) We 
would sit cross-legged in a circle around.Jack and he would fill 
his pipe with his own private blend  burley, latakia, and shred
ded coconut. The rest of us preferred tobacco, so we would light 
up Philip Morris. This is a procedure I recommend without qual
ification to everyone who prefers tobacco because Philip Morris 
has the tobacco that tobacco-preferers prefer the most  mild 
vintage leaf with a clean, cool flavor that soothes and steadies, 
that gladdens and enlivens and refreshes.
Jack would puff on his pipe and we would puff on our 
Philip Morris and the bull-session would begin its meandering 
journey. The talk would touch on every subject known to man, 
on every conceivable thing beneath the sun, but no matter how 
far the conversation wandered, it would always return to Topic 
A. I refer, of course, to gardening.
But, as I say, the discussion would cover many subjects before 
it came to the inevitable gardening. Jack would open each session 
with a provocative question of a general nature, like: Whats 
the most important thing a man can get out of college?
Girls, Harold Clavicle would reply promptly. (Good old 
Harold! I hear hes in the frozen lobster tail game now.)
No, I dont think so, Ben Fibula would say. I think edu
cation is the most important thing you get out of college. 
(Good old Ben! Hes still in school.)
Listen, guys, Ive got a question, Clyde Ilium would say. 
^If you could spend a week either with Ava Gardner or with 
Albert Einstein, which would you choose? (Good old Clyde! I 
hear hes in the unclaimed freight game now.)
Albert Einstein, of course, Will Mandible would say. (Good 
old Will! I hear hes in the jack handle game now.)
What? Cleanth Patella would cry, astonished. You would 
rather spend a week with Albert Einstein than with Ava 
Gardner? (Good old Cleanth! I hear hes in the unclaimed 
freight game with Clyde Ilium.)
Natch! Will Mandible would answer.
But why? Sol Sacrum would ask. (Good old Sol! I hear hes 
a parking meter in Deal, New Jersey.)
Because, Will Mandible would cry, if I spent a week with 
Albert Einstein, maybe I would get so smart that I would 
be able to figure out a way to spend more than a week with 
Ava Gardner!
Well sir, we laughed until our little uvulas were sore and then 
we went on to a host of other topics. Do you think its im
portant to join a fraternity? Murray Tarsus would ask. (Good 
old Murray! I hear hes in the mica game now.)
Only if you are a boy, Bob Turbinate would answer. (Good 
old Bob! I hear hes in the sheared raccoon game now. [The 
raccoon, incidentally, was invented by Milton Raccoon, whose 
career should be a source of guidance and inspiration to us all. 
Mr. Raccoon arrived in this country in 1907, penniless and not 
peaking a word of English. Today he is the Mayor of four of 
our principal cities. 1)
But to get back to the bull session Whats the best thing 
to do when the girl you are dancing with insists on leading? 
Eric'Ulna would ask. (Good old Eric! I hear hes in the flutter 
valve game now.)
Hit her with a folded newspaper, George Vertebra would 
answer. Never hit a girl with your hand. They learn to associ
ate the hand with food, and you must not confuse them. (Good 
old George! I hear hes in the folded newspaper game now.)
And so it went  the talk ranging the worlds of the arts and 
the sciences and the social graces, until we would climb, spent 
but happy, into our little hammocks ... I wonder if they still 
make bull sessions the way they used to.>Max Shulman, 1955

Enrollment Doivn 
From Fall Figures 
To 2864 Students
January 31 and February 1 saw 
almost 3000 students registering 
for the spring semester. As usual 
the spring enrollment was smaller 
than that in the fall, for some 
students finish their studies dur
ing the fall semester and there 
was no new group of freshmen 
entering the school.
But there were some new faces 
in the registration line. There 
were 59 new day school students: 
30 in Engineering and Science; 
eight in Industrial Administration; 
Printing Management, and Indus
trial Management; 13 in Margaret 
Morrison; and eight in Fine Arts. 
Those new students are due 
mainly to transfers.
There is a total of 2,864 day 
school students on the Tech cam
pus. Engineering and Science has 
1510; Industrial Management, 90; 
Printing Management, 119; Psy
chology, 9; Industrial Administra
tion, 6; Fine Arts, 560; Margaret 
Morrison, 482: and Carnegie Li
brary School, 38.
The evening school has 1,038 in 
its enrollment. These figures are 
accurate as of February 11, 1955.
The Registrars Office was very 
pleased that 400 students took the 
opportunity to prepay registration 
fees. The prepayment plan, begun 
a year ago, has proved to be a 
great help on registration day. It 
is hoped that more students will 
make use of this system.

want. At times during last semester you 
probably wondered if we ever gave a thought 
to student opinion. Well, we do, but we have 
one big problem. Just what does the campus 
want in the way of a paper?
For the past semester we were content 
to follow the tried and true forms the Tartan 
has used for years. We used the same balance 
of news, features* and sports as in the past. 
But is this what the students want? We dont 
know.
To aid our self-evaluation we have print
ed below a form which we hope you will 
fill out and return to the Tartan via intra
school mail. On this form we have listed 
our present features. We want y^u to indi
cate your likes and dislikes by checking the 
appropriate columns. Provided also is a 
space for any additional comments or sug
gestions you may have. Your honest evalua
tion will be greatly appreciated.
We of the Tartan will honestly try to 
incorporate your preferences into the paper. 
No doubt, we can never please you allbut, 
well try!But Doctor! I only wanted a check-up!

Over The 
Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewc
This school, if I may use such a descriptive 
term, will lose some of its brightness this week 
when Mrs. Updike, secretary in the Dean of Mens 
office, leaves permanently for New York. Kitty, as 
she is known to many of us, gave a personality to 
the unpleasant job of room assigning for the mens 
dorms. Many a guy has appreciated the quick 
shifting of roommates to the satisfaction of all 
concerned.
Last Friday, I spent approximately one hour in 
the fabric department of one of the larger down
town stores. This little excursion proved quite in
teresting to this observed observer who felt quite 
out of place and a little embarassed. However, the. 
type of people who buy dress patterns and material 
are, for lack of a better term, a motley crew. There 
was a very stout lady of 45 standing in her stock
ing feet (her shoes had been removed and were 
daintily kicked under the table), looking through a 
pattern book. The joke of the matter is the section
of the book that interest her the most was Ad
vanced Imported Designs.
A second lady, I shall assume she was a lady 
for she was wearing a silver fur coat, stood at the 
counter and argued with the salves lady over the 
exchange of two 60c patterns. Other people stood 
around talking in low voices or flitted from bolt 
to bolt feeling, stretching and occasionally saying 
to no one in particular, Oh look, it is wrinkle 
proof.

Little Quickies: Congratulations to Bill Aiken 
and Frank Shuck for breaking existing swimming 
records. . . . Congratulations to the basketball team, 
in downing Westminster 86-63. . . . Question of the 
week: Was it the chicken ala king that had all the 
girls in Morewood flipping their cookies, or did 
someone goof with the usual week-end dose?
... A wise man once said that if all the pro
fessors stood in a single line they would reach 
halfway across the Atlantic Ocean. The residents
of McGill Hall are in favor of this.............Greek
Sing and Swing is here. So are all the exams 
scheduled for the Monday afterwards. I think the 
student-faculty relationship is real considerate in 
this respect. (The last sentence is to be read with 
a touch of sarcasm. Unfortunately, sarcasm cannot 
be written in script.) ... I thought Id pick up 
material for this column by observing the girls 
pick up their sorority bids this year. However, Ive 
decided to chicken-out again. Fraternity, rushing 
may be rough, but no one cries over the whole 
mess.* * *
Then there was the handsome attache of the 
State Department whose success was a mixture of 
his own charm and romantic appeal and his wifes 
ability as a hostess. However, there came a time 
when his wife got fed up with his peccadilloes.
Evelyn says shes going to leave me if I dont 
quit running around with other women, the 
young diplomat told a friend.
Oh, Im sorry, said the friend.
So am Isaid the diplomat. Ill miss her *

LetterSerenades
Editor, the Tartan:
Although I am a member of the male popu-^ 
lation here at Tech, I feel, as does Mr. Szewc, 
(over the Skibo Table; Tuesday, February 22, 1955) 
that the serenades at Morewood Gardens have be
come rather infrequent of late. It is my contention 
that the lack of singing has been due, for the 
most part, to the inclement weather to which Pitts
burgh has been subjected recently. However, I 
think several other factors have been significant 
enough to cause fraternities to shy away from 
Morewood serenades.
Morewood Gardens forms one of the best am-^ 
phitheaters that stands within many miles of Pitts
burgh. The structure is such that singing groups 
find Morewood Gardens suited to their acoustical 
needs better than Carnegie Music Hall. Unfortu
nately, the focal point of this amphitheater, that is, 
the point at which it is most advantageous to locate 
the singing group, falls aright in the middle of a 
plot of grass on the street side of the pond.
Even more unfortunate is the fact that the grass 
on this plot is unable to withstand the onslaught j 
of the 40 pairs of feet that move across it in the 
course of one of the serenades. Therefore, when 
the choice had to be made between the continued 
existence of the grass and the perpetuation of an 
acoustically advantageous position for serenading 
groups, the administration was inclined in favor 
of the grass, due, no doubt, to its more permanent 
nature. Since the various singing groups have been 
excluded from this vantage point, the acoustical re
inforcement afforded by the amphitheater has been 
reduced disappointingly. gj
One other deterrent to the procession of sere
nades that once graced Morewood Gardens was the 
reception given to at least one group as they sang.
It seems that the garbage disposal unit was not 
working the night the group chose to serenade, 
and one girl picked a rather unfortunate time and 
place to reduce her supply of rotten tomatoes. We 
must give her credit for her aim, however, for 
she scored direct hits on two of the group, and 
the tomatoes were aged enough io envelope sev
eral others standing nearby. This is no small feat, $ 
as any of you that have tried already know.
These factors are not catastrophic in magnitude 
I admit, but might be sufficient to explain the re
cent letdown in the serenading. Granted, there is 
little that can be done to combat the weather con
ditions, but I do wish there were something that 
could be done to alleviate the other conditions that 
I mentioned. If a solution exists, I am sure it will 
be obvious to those who are mostly directly con
cerned with its enactment. j
Sincerely,
George Candler

Tartans Turn Back 
Presidents, 79-57
Benchwarmers Spell Regulars; Goetz
Nathanson Plays An Excellent Game
It was the benchwarmers who stole the show as the Tartans 
avenged an early season defeat by whipping the W & J Prexies, 79- 
67. Still imbued with the razzle-dazzle they displayed against Case, 
Tech put on a good shooting show that featured Charley Goetz, Bill 
Dosey, Ralph Mocker, and Dick#----------------------------------------------------
Fieler
Big Charley Goetz gave the Tar
tans the needed shot in the arm, 
with his jump-shots and rebound
ing. Bill Dosey got up off the 
bench and b.anged in three quick 
sets to help Tech keep within range 
of the Prexies in the first half. 
And not to be left out was Wayne 
Nathanson, who played a whale of 
a game.
Presidents Take Early Lead
With Godfrey and Kushner lead
ing the way, W & J built up an 
early lead, and with about 12 min
utes of the game gone, was leading 
26-17, when Goetz entered, fol
lowed shortly by Bill Dosey. With
in a few minutes, the complexion 
of the game changed with Tech 
now in the lead 31-29. Jeff tied 
it at 31-31 all, and went ahead 
33-31. Goetz, who had been play
ing heads up ball, then tied the 
score with a jump shot at 33-all, 
for the third and final time. The 
half ended with Tech in the lead, 
35-34 and gaining momentum 
which carried over to the second 
half, as they scored 44 points to
33 for the tiring Prexies. Cy 
Godfrey, the W & J thin man, 
was the only one between Tech 
and a complete rout, as he dunked 
in five hook shots in the second 
half to keep the Prexies in the 
game.
Tartans Hot in Second Half
The second half was completely 
dominated by Tech, who, with 
Fieler, Goetz, and Mocker hitting 
on shots, rapidly built up an 11 
point lead. Playing fairly even for 
the first few minutes, and with the 
score at 43-40 in favor of Tech, the 
Tartans suddenly got hot and were 
rebounding and hitting on almqgt 
every shot, and outscored the 
Prexies in this five minute flurry 
13-3, to bring the score to 56-43.
Tired Prexies
While Tech was having trouble 
getting the ball to stay in the bas
ket midway in the period, Godfrey 
and friends narrowed the gap to 
60-53, but Tech again found the 
range as Mocker and Fieler sent 
the ball swishing through the nets. 
Godfrey, who had played the

Swimmers Beat W&J; 
Lose To Grove City
Aiken, Shuck 
Set Records
For the fourth time in as many 
meets, Bill Aiken, captain of the 
swimming team, lowered his own 
personal record and the pool rec
ord in the 200 yard orthodox 
breaststroke event. This past 
week Bill lowered the Tech pool 
mark as he beat out Bowie of 
Grove City in the record time of 
2:35.3. Saturday, at Washington, 
Pa., Aiken broke the W&J pool 
mark with a time of 2.33.1. In the 
same meet, Frank Shuck, a fresh
man, set a pool record in the 200 
yard backstroke event, with a 
of 2:31.5.
Aikens time before he started 
on his record spree was 2:42.5.
Skibos Are Hot In Second Quarter, 
Score 48 Points To 27 For The Titans
Ignoring the experts predieitions and Techs place in their list 
of Tri-State basketball standings, Techs hustling Tartans ran the 
Westminster Titans into the ground on the Titans home court, 
86.63. This is quite a feat when compared to the trouble Duquesne had
defeating this same team on the#-------------------------------------------------
same floor, and by only one or
two points.
It was excellent ballhandling, 
a Tech trademark, and deadly 
shooting, flanked by good defen
sive team work and tremendous 
rebounding by A1 Frank, that did 
the trick.
Westminsters high scoring Jim 
Riley, 6-6 center, was held to one 
field goal and three foul shots 
while Dick Fieler, A1 Frank, and 
Jim Boyd were scoring 22, 20 
and 18 points respectively. Fieler 
especially put on a good shoot
ing show, hitting on ten field goals 
and only two fouls.
Tech Leads at Halftime

Fieler and good defensive work 
that gave Tech the lead at halftime, 38-36. Boyd and Fieler con
tributed 22 points between them 
in the first period.
With the beginning of the sec
ond period, the Titans tied the 
score at 38-38, but then Tech 
started on the rampage that was 
the beg'nning of the end for 
Westminster, as the Speedy 
Scots ran away from their big
ger hosts, scoring 48 points in the 
second half to 27 for Westmin
ister.
Tartans End Season
Again the scoring for the Tar
tans was evenly distributed as 
four members of the squad were 
in double figures. Fieler led the 
way with 22 points on 10 field 
goals and two fouls, Frank added 
20 points on seven field goals and 
six fouls, Boyd contributed 18 
points on 5 baskets and eight 
charity throws, and Charley 
Goetz, the freshman from North 
Catholic who has been playing 
so well lately, added 14 markers 
to the count on five buckets and 
four free throws.
This coming Wednesday, March 
2, the Speedy Scots, will end 
the 1955 basketball season when 
they meet the Rockets from Slip
pery Rock. The team record at 
the moment is 13 wins and 10 
losses; after the game Wednesday 
night the team should have a 14 
and 10 record, which will be one 
of the best and most successful 
seasons the Tartans have enjoy
ed. This will be the final appear
ance of Bill Dosey and Eddie 
Miller who are slated to gradu
ate this coming June.
Al Frank
Star Rebounder
Last Saturday, the Tartan mermen posted their eighth win in 
ten starts as they swamped W & J at the Prexies pool, 48-27. In 
a rather fast pool, Bill Aiken and Frank Shuck set new pool records 
in the 200 yard breast stroke, and 200 yard back stroke, respectively.
Aiken posted a time of 2:33.1#-----------;-----------------------------------------
while teammate Shuck was
whirling away in the pool for 
2:31.5 minutes.
Tech won the two relays, post
ing an excellent time in the 400- 
yard free style relay of four min
utes flat, and took four of the 
seven individual events. Demas 
McVay, of the home squad, took 
two of the three firsts that the 
t Prexies captured, and scored 13 
points, more than half the teams 
total points.
In the individual events, Mike 
Litch took first in his specialty 
the 60 yard dash, with a 
time of :31.1, while Bob Coulter 
added a win in the individual 
medley with a time of 1:24.6. The 
other two firsts that the Tartans 
were the record breaking times 
posted by Shuck and Aiken.
This week the merman close 
out the season with a meet at 
Meadville with Allegheny Col
lege, and then Saturday travel to 
Grove City to compete in the 
Penn-Ohio swimming meet, and
try to regain th crown that Tech 
lost last year. The last time Tech 
was Penn-Ohio champ was in

Lack of depth was the sad story 
as the Tartan mermen went down 
to their second defeat of the sea
son. This time the aquamen lost 
to a very strong Grove City team, 
which has improved tremendously 
over last years squad, by the score 
of 55-29.
Life Saving
A special course in Red 
Cross Life Saving and Water 
Safety is being offered to the 
male students of Carnegie 
Tech by the Mens Physical

one of them a record-breaking ef
fort by Bill Aiken in the 200 yard 
breast stroke. The time for this 
event was 2:35.3. In the 100 yard 
freestyle event, Stellar of Grove 
City broke the pool record, posting 
a time of :55.2.

His individual training paid off
When Ray NewBusiness Administration, Buffalo, 51 
started with New York Telephone Company, he never suspected 
his work would face him with problems of this sort
66My job as business office manager 
is to see that the customer gets the best 
possible service. One of my assignments 
took me into a section of Manhattan that 
had a large Puerto Rican population.
Frequently our people would get 
somebody on the line who couldnt speak 
a word of English. So I saw to it that 
each of my representatives learned a few 
standard Spanish phrasesenough to get 
somebody to the telephone who could 
speak English.
64There are no two days alike in this
work, with new problems coming up all 
the time. The best part of it is that the 
training program here is tailor-made to 
the job First you get a general back
ground in the business, then you go into 
what I call individual training.* That's 
where your own special abilities are de
veloped and youre encouraged to think 
out new ways to solve everyday prob
lemslike the one I just described.
66Right now Im Business Manager 
in charge of an office doing $250,000 
worth of business a month.
Youll find these things true of college men, like Ray 
New, who go into telephone work. Theyve been well 
trained, they enjoy their present jobs, and theyre 
headed for responsibilities and greater rewards. If 
youd be interested in a similar opportunity with a Bel! 
telephone operating company, or with Samlia Corpora*

Night School Student 
Makes Visit To Skiho
Lately it seems that evening students are availing themselves of 
the specious and ideal facilities of Skibo as a social and/or business 
meeting place. Typical of this type of student is Satire Schmoe 
class of 85 who makes it a definite point to be heard if not seen. 
Upon entering Skibo through ?
yon portals, he seeks the table that 
is the center of activity and is sit
uated in a section that commands 
the view of incoming and outgoing 
students, preferably girls.
Presently two of his chums, 
cronies, pals, and what-have-you, 
enter and receive the high sign 
from Satire Schmoe, and with 
gay shouts and screams of saluta
tion, join him. As is customary, a 
toast is offered to Dear Old Tech, 
Carnegie Tech with a stimulating 
brew of delicious, nutritious, aro
matic, (what are we saying!) 
coffee.
Topics Discussed
The meeting is called to order 
and yarious topics ensue, embrac
ing such technical and scientific 
discussions as politics, girls, chem
istry, girls, taxes, girls, foreign 
affairs, girls, and Tech co-eds.
As is always the case in any 
group, someone has to be out-ofstep with the general proceedings. 
Penrod Birdbrain decides he 
does not relish his R grade in 
physics and attempts to boneup on the days assignment since 
his class will commence in 300
seconds. Above the din and clamor 
of never ceasing chatter and juke
box refrains of Papa Loves Mambo, he begins his reading ritual 
by casually brushing aside the 
bread crumbs from the table, wip
ing gravy and coffee stains from 
books and necktie, and flicking 
cigarette ashes into nearby cups, 
any cup, filled or empty.
Dignity of Man
At this point, a crystal clear 
tenor falsetto voice is heard sug
gesting that it is common knowl
edge that if one is intent on study
ing, one seeks the quiet and soli
tude offered in the library. Pen
rod resents being termed one with 
common knowledge and preserves 
his dignity of man by turning a 
deaf ear to these choice words of 
wisdom.
The hour of decision (seven 
oclock) arrives and a stampede 
towards those swinging doors is a 
sight to behold. Scratch one bus 
boy! Poor fellows agility wasnt 
too agile.
Any resemblance to evening stu
dents living or graduated is purely 
intentional.
ES Newman Club 
To Hold Marriage 
Lecture Series
In line with their policy of a 
successful organization is an ac
tive organization, Techs Evening 
School Newman Club has prepared 
a full schedule of topic discus
sions and social activities for the 
current semester.  The program 
thus far has included a meeting 
held on February 13, with Rever
end William G. Connare as guest 
speaker and a semi-formal dance, 
(Intercollegiate Ball) at Mt. Mercy 
College.
A Lenten discussion series has 
been planned as follows:
Feb. 27The Ideal Husband and 
Wife
Mar. 6Courtship and Morality 
Mar. 13Psychology of the Sexes 
Mar. 20Spirituality of Marriage 
Mar.27Physical Hygiene of Mar
riage
The speakers conducting these 
discussions will be: Rev. William 
J. Cheetham of St. Cyril of Alex
andria Church, Reverend Russell 
Meyers, Chaplain of PIFSCO, and 
Reverend Thomas OConnor of St. 
Mary of Mercy, an eminent doctor.
Plans are being made for an 
Orphans Party to be held some
time during April. On May 1, there 
will be a meeting at the Carnegie 
Union with Reverend Eloy Grundler, founder of Carnegie Tech 
Evening School Newman Club, as 
guest speaker. He will talk on 
Catholic Action and Organization. 
On May 15, there will be a ban
quet held at the Union. Also dur
ing May, there will be picnic with

sponsored by Tech Newman Club, 
is open to all who would desire to 
attend. The discussions .be
gin at 7:30 p.m. on dates as
signed, at the Carnegie Union. It 
is hoped that knowledge gained by 
these topics will be of invaluable 
aid to those contemplating mar
riage as well as married couples 
who may seek advice relative to 
the listed topics. A cordial invi
tation is extended to one and all.
Editorial
Hurrah, The Worker
On every front these days, the bright lights and glitter 
call us, beg us, and talk us into joining them and wasting 
our precious time. Some of us fall by the wayside in avenues 
of fun and pleasure. But the worker bites his lip and car
ries on even in the face of almost unsurmountable work 
and tension. Work keeps the mind clear, the morals pure 
and the muscles strong. It is a form of health, virtue and 
conscience. Without work the farmers crop fail, the me
chanics tools become rusty and worthless, and the business 
mans door close.
Evening school is dedicated to the worker; the worker 
who awakens to the alarm, eats by the time clock and 
studies with a stopwatch. He is a brave soul who is willing 
to give up many nights each year for an education when so 
many frivolous pleasures attract his attention.
Consider the worker turned student leaving home two 
or three times a week for the classroom. Then multiply 
that by the present enrollment, times three or four for 
the wives, children and friends left behind. Perhaps that 
picture is slightly out of focus, but in most cases it means a 
quick change of clothes, a hot cup of coffee, and a hasty hello 
and good-bye to the family. Why do we do it? What is the 
drive? Where does it end? In most cases it ends with a 
sigh of relief, a big welcome home and the satisfaction of a 
job well done. ~
Take the man any day who can tell you all the cur
rent television jokes, or brief you on the local gossip and 
ten to one youll find he has never heard of evening school, 
nor does he care to hear about it. There he might better 
his education and improve his abilities at work and there
by make this a better country in which to live. For as we 
learn today, so we will think and act tomorrow. We must 
be thankful for this magnificent opportunity!
Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work 
with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should 
leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take 
alms of those who work with joy/Gilbran.

International Club 
To Discuss Asia 
At Next Meeting
The Tech International Club 
will meet Thursday night at 8.00 
p.m. in the Carnegie Union. Mr. 
John Dunderdale, of the YMCA 
in India, will speak on Revolu
tion in South Asia.
Nowhere in the world are 
changes taking place so quickly 
and on such a vast scale as in 
India, the home of one seventh of 
all the people in the world. These 
changes have grown in size and 
significance since the end of World 
War I, until today they are of re
volutionary dimensions. For 19 
years of this dynamic period, John
H. Dunderdale has been associat
ed with the Indian YMCA as it 
has tried to help young people find 
their place in the new social or
der.
Since 1949, Mr. Dunderdale has j 
been in charge of the YMCAs i 
training department. During that j 
time, one third of all YMCA secre
taries related to the Indian move
ment have completed a one-year 
course at the Training School of 
which Mr. Dunderdale is the 
principal. Today, through their 
local associations, these men are 
demonstrating how Christianity 
can contribute constructively to 
the new India.
Besides his work with YMCA 
secretaries, Mr. Dunderdale also 
works with volunteer club leaders 
and committee men to help them 
understand more fully their part 
in the YMCAs job. Because 
training leaders is one of the 
YMCAs number one tasks every
where, Mr. Dunderdale has trav
eled to consultations sponsored by 
the Worlds Alliance in Denmark, 
Thailand, and the Philippines. On 
these occasions, he has been able 
to share the experience of the In
dian movement with representa
tives of other YMCAs across the 
world.
John Dunderdale is a native of 
Ottawa, Canada, and holds de
grees from the University of Ma
nitoba and Columbia University 
and served with the YMCA in 
Windsor, Ontario and New York 
before going to India.
F rats
[Continued from Page 1] 
would be collected in the form of 
rent from the men living in the 
house. Due to the added improve
ments the rent would probably be 
raised ten dollars to $180 per year 
per man.
The proposed first floor would 
include a lounge, trophy room, 
dining room, kitchen, and bed
room, bath, and living room for a 
housemother. The basement fa
cilities suggested a recreation and 
club room, chapter room, toilet, 
trunk storage, kitchen storage, 
laundry, and employees locker 
room and toilet. The second and 
third floors would have study and 
sleeping rooms, and showers for
36 men.
Dr. Warner emphasized that no 
fraternity is being forced to 
adopt this plan and that it is 
entirely up to the fraternity as to 
whether it comes in or not.
Weather Show 
At Planetarium
Buhl Planetariums new sky 
show, opening March 1, deals with 
the weather. In Weather Lore, 
the Planetarium presents the sim
ple rudiments of the science for 
all to use. The true meaning of 
familiar adages and proverbs, 
some of them quoted as long ago 
as 4000 B.C., is explained in this 
production. Many weather signs 
and portents are Visually portray
ed, including familiar types of 
clouds, lunar haloes, and the 
old moon in the new moons 
arms, all helpful in foretelling, 
day by day, approaching rain or 
snow or other storm conditions. 
By knowing the meaning of these 
signs, everyone can become an 
amateur weatherman.
The exciting climax of Weath
er Lore portrays a clashing thun
derstorm. Sky shows are present
ed at 2:15 and 8:30 p.m. week
days; 2:15, 4:15 and 8:30 p.m. 
Sundays. A special Childrens 
Sky Show is presented at the 
Planetarium every Saturday at 
11:00 a.m.
In the Planetarium galleries is 
exhibited the eighteenth annual 
show of the Allegheny Artists 
League, one of the oldest of Pitts
burghs art groups. Oils and water 
colors predominate in the exhibit, 
but prints, drawings, and other 
media ai'e shown, resulting in an 
unusual and stimulating presen
tation by the League.
Scholarships
Scholarship applications for 
financial assistance during the 
academic year 1955-1956 are 
now available in AH 154. All 
applications are due by April 
1. 1955.

By Pgh. Playhouse
Director Frederick Burleigh of 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse held 
auditions for new talent on Sun
day, February 27 for the coming 
spring musical at the Community

In addition to approving the 
above committees, the members 
approved a motion to change the 
Council quorum from two-thirds 
to seven-twelfths of the represen
tatives. It was felt that this figure 
would cut down the number of 
quorumless meetings which have 
occurred in the past without sac
rificing the safeguards of a quorum 
requirement.
