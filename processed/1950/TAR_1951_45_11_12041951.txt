Council Hears Case of SC. 
Dissolution Petition Signers
Discussion Of CIT Campus Politics Held;
Another Amendment To Constitution Passed
Joe Pecenka, one of the signers of the recent petition calling 
for the dissolution of Student Council, appeared before Council last 
Wednesday to present his reasons for desiring such action: Pecenka 
strongly attacked what he termed poor student representation 
in Council, saying, Student ?----------------------------------------------------
Council elections have decayed to 
machine politics. He maintained 
that the present system of assign
ing representation to the various 
colleges did not recognize the trvje 
political factions on campus.
Powers Inadequate 
Pecenka went on to charge that 
the general apathy of the student 
body, Council itself, and the ad
ministration concerning student 
activity and problems did not 
justify the existence of Council. 
He also criticized Council on the 
grounds that its powers were in
adequate and that it was not ful
filling the responsibilities it does 
have.
He quoted from the SC consti
tution to the effect that one of 
the duties of Council was to es
tablish and perpetuate school 
spirit and customs and stated 
that Council had completely fail
ed to do this. He further charged 
that the school administration ex
ercised undue control over Coun
cil.
Discussion Period
Pecenka concluded his state
ment by saying, Student Coun
cil continues to exist only because 
of precedent, and not because of 
need or desire.
There was a brief question and 
answer period after Pecenkas 
statement, in which Council mem
bers directed various questions at 
him. The general concensus of 
Council opinion was that school 
spirit was very low, but that 
Council had recognized the situa
tion and was attempting to do 
something about it. They did not 
feel that the dissolution of Coun
cil would solve the problem.
New Petition Out 
Dick Franklin also stated that 
SC was interested in the prob
lems of the student body as a 
whole, and cited the current in
vestigation of Skibo prices as an 
example of this. Wes Apple de
nied Pecenkas charge of machine 
politics in SC election, stating 
that the frat machine (IAC) had 
more or less disbanded.
When the petition was brought 
to a vote, it was defeated. How
ever, another petition is being cirCIT Irivited To 
Intercollegiate 
Bridge Tourney
Carnegie Tech is one of more 
than 300 colleges and universities 
invited to compete in the 1952 Na
tional Intercollegiate Bridge 
Tournament. Invitations and entry 
blanks have been received by col
lege officials.
Only undergraduates are eligi
ble to play in the duplicate con
tract bridge event for the title and 
trophy. A preliminary round will 
be played by mail in February, 
and the 16 highest ranking pairs 
will meet for the face-to-face finals 
at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago 
on April 18 and 19, with their ex
penses paid by the tournament 
committee.
culated with a goal of 150 signa
tures, which would require the 
proposal to be brought to vote 
in an all-school assembly. A % 
majority would be required to 
pass the resolution.
Amendment Passed
An amendment to the SC con
stitution was passed, which will 
increase the investigating powers 
of Council. It reads as follows: 
Student Council shall be empow
ered to make investigations in such 
matters as concern -the student 
body or any portion thereof, and 
to make recommendations to the 
administration concerning the in
vestigated matter. The constitu
tion of the Cameron Choir and a 
general revision of the points and 
keys award system were also ap
proved.
Campus Chest Lags
A1 De Vido reported that stu
dent contributions to the Campus 
Chest had only reached % of 
the quota. He plans to contact the 
fraternities, sororities, and dorms 
in an attempt to stimulate student 
donations.
It was explained that the senior 
class square dance scheduled for 
November 30 was called off not 
because of lack of student sup
port, but because of a mix-up in 
the arrangements for Thistle Hall.
Wes Apple reported that the 
Bloodmobile will be at Carnegie 
Tech December 6. He expects to 
be able to fill the quota and stated 
that the Bloodmobile might come 
back if there is an excess of 
donors.
SC Elections
Student Council elections 
will be held Tuesday, Decem
ber 12.
Petitions for the Student 
Council representatives and 
assistant secretary are due 
today, December 4, at 4:30 in 
the dean of mens office. The 
election is open to all full-time 
students in E&S, Margaret 
Morrison, and Fine Arts.
Blood Mobile 
Will Visit CIT
Red Cross Unit HereIAll Day Thursday
On this Thursday, December 6, 
the Blood Mobile, sponsored by 
Student Council, will be at Car
negie Inn. In order to give blood, 
persons must 18 years of age; and 
if under 21 years, must have writ
ten permission from their par
ents. Students must make appoint
ments to give blood.
Every student who holds an ap
pointment card and has class at 
that particular time, will be ex
cused from class. In order to be 
excused for a rest period after 
blood is given, the appointment 
card must be initialed at the Blood 
Mobile and shown to the professor 
as evidence that the student was 
giving blood. Appointments can 
be made any day next week from 
11:30 to 1:30 in Skibo and Admin
istration Hall. Wes Apple, the 
chairman of this special campaign, 
has asked Cwens, Scimitars, Delta 
Skull, and the senior and fresh
man class officers to help recruit 
176 students, the required num
ber of donors.
The Red Cross is not going to 
sell this blood, but is going to give 
it to the GIs in Korea. As a pro
motion to this worthy cause, Stu
dent Council and Scabbard and 
Blade have voted to give blood as 
a group. The faculty is invited to 
contribute.
Twenty-Three Girls Vie 
For Honorary Colonel Title
Scabard and Blade, honorary of ROTC, will sponsor the next 
all school dance Saturday night, December 8, in the gym from 9:00 
to 1:00. While military men are requested to wear their ROTC uni
form to the formal dance, non-members are to wear tuxedos. Flow
ers are to be omitted. ?---------------------------------------------
Music for the evening will be 
furnished by A1 Hartman and his 
12 piece band and a vocalist. Tick

35 Schools Combine 
In Drive For Books
Students from over 35 colleges, high schools, and private and 
parochial schools in the Pittsburgh area have joined together to 
sponsor a square dance to raise funds for the CARE-UNESCO Book 
Program. The dance will be held in the ballroom of the Syria
Mosque Saturday, December 8,* 
from 8:30 to 12:00 .m.
Due to the book burnings and 
bombings which took place during 
the war, the students in the uni
versities in war-torn countries are 
in dire need of text and technical 
books. During the years of World 
War II, these countries were cut 
off from any information on mod
ern medical and scientific devel
opments which took place in this 
country.
Shortage of Story Books 
Besides the need for text and 
technical books in these countries, 
there is a great shortage of pic
ture story books for children.
The students who are taking 
an active part in organizing this 
dance realize how incomplete a 
life without books would be, and 
hope to alleviate this dearth of 
learning by sending books, bought 
with the proceeds from the dance, 
to the people overseas. The actual
selecting, packaging, and shipping 
will be done through CARE 
UNESCO.
Two Intermissions
Carl Dozer, Pittsburgh radio 
personality, will be master of ce
remonies at the dance. The Duquesne Tamburitzans and the 
Wilkinettes will entertain during 
the first of two intermissions. 
The drawing for door prizes will 
take place during the second inintermission.
Twenty volunteer square dance 
calers will help organize the vari
ous groups and act as instructors. 
These volunteers will act as call
ers during the course of the eve
ning. Lawrence Peelers square 
dance band wil provide the music.
Tickets are $1.00 per person 
and are on sale in Skibo all this 
week at noon between 11:30 and 
1:30. No tickets will be sold at 
the door Saturday evening.

CIT Debate 
Club Wins 
First Match
Tying for first place with Penn 
State Saturday in their first ma
jor debate of the year, the Car
negie debaters, coached by Mr. 
R. C. Oswant, are now preparing 
for a meet at Pitt this Saturday.
Competing with 16 other schools 
from Pennsylvania and Ohio, CIT, 
represented by Lee Shevel and 
Bill Venable on the affiirmative, 
and Janice Nelson and Ronald 
Curhan on the negative, set the 
pace with seven consecutive wins.
The negative team lost its last 
round in a closely contested match 
with Mt. Mercy College, and thus 
dropped undisputed possession of 
first place.
CITs debating society is one 
of the sponsors of a series of in
tercity debate tournaments. In 
these tournaments, special em
phasis is placed on arranging de
bates for new debaters. A system 
is used giving each contestant an 
individual critique rather than 
just the simple decision.
Plans are now being made to 
expand the novice tournaments to 
include debaters with previous in
tercollegiate experience.
Pre-Schedule
All students are urged to 
complete pre-scheduling for 
the second semester now by 
contacting their department 
head or mentor. Department 
representatives will not be in 
the gym during spring semes
ter registration, and students 
will be inconvenienced in or
ganizing a schedule at that 
time.
This notice applies to all 
students except freshmen in 
Engineering and Science, 
Printing Management, and 
Industrial Management.

Editorials
In The Arm, iVot Wallet
With the current Blood-Mobile drive on campus, stu
dents have an opportunity to redeem themselves after t,heir 
showing on the Campus Chest. A report at the last Council 
meeting showed that only one-third of the student goal has 
been met to date. But, being students, its entirely possible 
that we have a lot more blood than we do money.
If every student at Carnegie Tech gave a pint of blood 
on Thursday it would mean 330 gallons of the precious stuff 
for Korea. Thats a lot of blood. But here at least is one 
drive that doesnt hit the students where it hurts the most 
in the pocketbook.
To most students who have never contributed before, 
there seems to be something vaguely wrong with giving up 
a pint of nice, healthy me. They are afraid that it will mean 
a two day recuperation period which they cant afford. On 
top of this, ugly rumors crop up from time to time to the 
effect that the Red Cross makes a mint selling blood to the 
Army. Both fears are unfounded. The Red Cross will let 
no one contribute who might suffer ill effects from losing 
the blood, and although the organizations costs from collect
ing the blood are paid by the government, it is strictly a 
non-profit undertaking.
A nationally syndicated columnist has often made the 
suggestion that every deferred person of draft age should 
be required to give a pint of blood every so often. Such a 
system wouldnt be half so convenient as that currently 
provided by the Red Cross; they do everything possible to 
make donation easy for the student. And doing something 
voluntarily goes down a lot easier than being told what 
to do and where to be.
How do we give the blood? Simple. Walk in the Dean 
of Students office today or tomorrow and sign up for a date 
on Thursday. Then show up at the proper time. (See details 
on page 1.) Student Council needs 176 donors to keep us 
out of the doghouselets prove that Tech really does have 
a heart!
(PSCongratulations to Council and to Scabbard and
Blade for their pledges oj 100% donation.)

Parking Trouble
A couple of years ago parking,space at Tech was scarcer 
than it is at noontime in the Golden Triangle. So in came 
the bulldozers and cut away the hillside and we had a big, 
new parking lot. But even in a new parking lot the old 
problems of the dont careso what attitude get a workout.
Whats more discouraging than rushing over the cut to 
make an appointment and finding some joker has doubleparked behind you, leaving the doors locked so that even 
pushing him is impossible. This situation has been repeated 
many times over of late. Perhaps even more space must 
be found to meet increasing parking requirements, but until 
this permanent solution can take shape students will have 
to solve the problem themselves with a little reflection on 
the Golden Rule.

Inquiring Reporter
Class Officers Answer 
6No Action9 Criticism
By Andy Stedry
Several weeks ago the inquiring reporter asked students what 
they thought of class organizations. Answer: Not much. Now here 
are some of the class officers telling how and why class organizations 
have hit such a low ebb. ?-----------------------------------------------------
Mildred Thompson, Secretary,
Senior Class. There are now too 
many activities on campus. Class 
organization is 
new, and it is 1 
therefore diffi
cult to transfer 
interest from 
these establish
ed a c t i v ities.
Freshmen com
ing in, however, 
should be en
thusiastic. They 
should be shown
that class organization is the most 
important job on campus. Those 
who are class officers are in many 
other activities and have many 
things to do which conflict with 
class duties. More studentsnot 
only those who are in activities 
should try to get into office, and 
voters should vote for those who 
are not too tied up in other activi
ties.
The class officers cannot get sup
port in their undertakings. For 
example, many students like to 
watch Varsity Varieties, but 
very few want to advertise and 
work for it.
Lastly, I dont think the class 
officers and their activities have 
been advertised enough.
Bill Sick, President, Freshman 
Class. Although I am probably 
not in a position to answer this 
question to any degree due to my 
lack of familiarity with class or-, 
ganization and 
its problems at 
Tech, I will try 
to give my 
opinions on this 
subject. From 
the standpoint 
of our fresh
man class org a n i z a tion, I 
feel that we 
have not been
given a chance to succeed. As yet, 
there has./-been no announcement 
of the outcome of freshman elec
tions. Due to this, some of the of
ficers do not know they were 
elected. In fact, no one, including 
the administration and the chair
man of elections, knows just who

the officers are. Due to this, plus 
the conflicting of the many other 
activities on campus and the rela
tive lack of authority of the class 
organization, the freshmen have 
not yet been able to come up with 
a dance project of any kind. I feel, 
however, that, given a chance and 
perhaps a push or suggestion from 
Student Council and the adminis
tration, the freshman class organ
ization can succeed.
Pete Sherman, Junior Treasurer. 
Class organizations as a whole 
have not been able to accomplish 
as much as could have been done 
in recent years. Their reorganiza
tion was started two years ago, 
and a little 
p r o g r ess has 
been made.
However, the 
main cause for 
their i n ability 
to get much ac
complished has 
been a confu
sion of their ob
jectives on the 
part of every
one involved, including the stu
dent body. It is hoped that event
ually the class officers will be able 
to coordinate not only their own 
classes, but the various groups 
and honoraries made up of their 
members. Freshman orientation 
and Frosh-Soph competition will 
be conducted by the entire classes 
under leadership of their officers 
and not by a small handful of in
dividuals, for it is only by stu
dent participation that these tradi
tions take on any meaning. A start 
was made two years ago when 
traditions exams were handed over 
to the class of 53 officers who 
succeeded in having all but eighty 
students pass the exam. Then it 
seems the object of class organi
zation was lost and it became just 
another individual affair instead 
of a school affair.
I think the failure in the past 
has been because of this misun
derstanding and lack of publicity 
for class organization. For exam
ple, how many students know that 
the first pep rally was conducted 
by the class officers? A concentrated effort is now being made to 
remedy these past failures.
Ned Clark, President, Sophomore Class.!
Class organiza-! 
tions in any. 
school are only j 
as good as their  
parti cipation.
Here at Tech, | #  
every students 2%*- 
primary inter-1] 
est is scholastic, 
and the secondary interest is 
in either a fraternity or a com
parable independent organization. 
This places class interest third, at 
best, and no group can function, 
especially a large one, with third 
and fourth rate spirit.
The solution to this situation lies 
with the individuals. The officers 
can plan, publicize, and push a 
project, but they cant form the 
rest of the class. The final ques
tion, therefore, still stands: If you 
want class organizations, partici
pate: find out what is going on in
stead of whimpering about not be
ing told. If not, lets get rid of 
them altogether.
Sam Cerni, President, Senior 
Class. Everybody complains about 
the way class 
organization is 
being handled.
I should like to 
give some of
the reasons why 
the class officers 
cant run the
class as they
would like. The 
main reason is 
the lack of stu
dent interest. In the senior class, 
some of this lack of interest is due 
to the fact that the class has only 
been organized for the past two 
years. Too many other smaller 
bodies hold conflicting events 
when ever the class is sponsoring 
something, thereby dividing the 
interest even more.
The class officers have no real 
authority. Almost all of the duties 
and services that the classes per
formed before the war have been 
absorbed by other bodies which 
are reluctant to give them up or 
even share them.
The lack of money in the class 
treasury is another handicap. If 
there were a balance to fall back 
on, many more functions could be 
scheduled. As it stands now, if an 
event cant make money, Student 
Council wont let us hold it.
However, I dont think that the 
class organization problem is as 
bad as it sounds. If the students 
and other organizations will only 
give it a chance, class organiza
tion can and will function proper
ly.'   i

Subtle Intrigue Lurks 
In Skibo Discussions
By Deek di Salvo
As I sit in my ivory tower, synthetically stimulated by Berliozs 
Orgy of the Brigands, the Second Epistle to the Tartans begins to 
take shape. The box score of caustic comments about Epistle No. 1 
is as follows: Come now di Salvo; You crusader you; Were 
against sin too; You didnt say#------- -------------------------------- -
anythingno comment; Ill lay 
you a buck you cant write a col
umn without injecting some por
tion of female anatomy as a de

make no comment on the wonder 
of the female figure, and promis

fill this column. In that den, where 
Pas-an-afternoon-itis is King and 
You fool you trumped my ace

Two mystic friends of mine were 
disturbing the organized whisper
ings of non-Fine Arts students.
Their conscientious objections 
about the whole systemespecial
ly the military systemdrowned 
out all else. The ice cream dippers 
Stopped; the cash register was 
still, and a group formed. With 
the usual consistency of Skibo 
discussions we ended by a devious 
route through: conversion of Com
munism; the Crusade for Freedom; 
Blood donors for the police affair 
in Korea; a rennaissance of art in 
our era; the paradox of America 
as commercial conquerer of the 
world and yet her inability to be
come the physical conquererwe 
ended in a discussion of man. 
Thus, in these few paragraphs, we 
shall decide the purpose of mans 
existence! Ha!

in that system is that man, once 
convinced he is nothing but an 
animal, acts like onebut then 
hasnt he always? Well, di Salvo, 
give us the gemthe solution! 
Like all politicians and columnists, 
having posed the question, I shall 
dodge the answer. I shall dodge 
an answer hoping that one of you 
eggs will hatch a mental answer.
Many Answers
Other centuries produced an
swers: I am the Truth the Way 
and the Life; the Aristotles, 
Aquinas and Kants gave answers 
and ideas. Why not our philoso
phers? Why not you? Some say, 
Have Faith, but faith in this age 
offers little consolation to the men 
who probe the very being of cre
ation and yet return with nothing 
but new discoveries in atomic en
ergy. Take heart! In a recent sur
vey, 2% of the high school stu
dents when asked to tell the time 
on their school room wall clocks, 
couldnt do it. We have answers! 
In our bridge games and weekend 
partiessans beer. We have hope! 
In our income tax scandals and

Tartans Take Steubenville; 
Drop 2nd To Lawrence Tech
Geneva And Waynesburg In Tilts This Week 
To Give Indications Of Carnegie Strength
Carnegie Techs basketball squad under the reins of head coach 
Mel Cratsley made a winning debut in the annual hoop madness last
Wednesday as they defeated the 
score. ^
.i.er a shaky start in the first 
haf, the Tartans found their con
fidence and their shooting eye in 
the second period as they pro
ceeded to rout the Ohio team with 
ease. Big Bill Farbacher led the 
Plaid attack for me evening with 
25 points as he turned in a ster
ling performance.
Blue Devils Victors 
Following what seems to be a 
standard pattern in the Carnegie 
schedule, the Tartans found them
selves on the short end of a 88-61 
score in their second contest. Play
ing their first away game at De
troit Saturday, the Plaid five fell 
victim to the Blue Devils of 
Lawrence Tech for the second 
straight year.
Trailing 17-12 at the first quar
ter and 35-25 at the halfway mark, 
the Tartans were still much in the 
game until midway of the third 
quarter. At that juncture Hilary 
Holste and Tom Craig left the con
test via the foul route and the 
game went completely out of con
trol, for Carnegie.
At the end of the third quarter 
the Plaid trailed by 57-43. Without 
the rebounding of Holste and 
Craig to hamper them, the Blue 
Devils ran wild as they outscored Carnegie 31-lb and more than 
doubled their margin.
The defeat was worse than the 
69-56 loss handed the Skibos last 
year by the Lawrence Tech team 
which went ahead to play in the 
National Invitational Tournament.
Two Tough Ones 
With one win and one loss un
der their belts much according to 
expectation, Cratsleys Tartans 
face Geneva and Waynesburg in 
away games this week. Results of 
these two games should give fans 
an indication of just what may be 
expected from the Plaid during 
the rest of the season.
Geneva and Waynesburg are 
both tough teams much on a par
Steubenville Barons by a 67-44
with the Plaid. However, the Covies defeated the Tartans twice last 
year and Waynesburg, another 
victor over the Skibos, is schedul
ing games in Madison Square 
Garden this year. Despite gradu
ation losses, this years edition of 
basketeers should measure at least 
on a par with last years squad. 
The next two games should tell.
Graduation Loss
Graduation cost the Plaid fourtop-notch hoopstersHans Acker
man, Connie Hammond, Bob Mc
Cullough, and Len Bianchi, who 
captained the 1950-1951 squad. 
However, six lettermen have re
turned to form a nucleus for a 
fast-breaking, hard-fighting team. 
Back again are Seniors Tom Beck 
and Harry Holste, Juniors Tom 
Craig, Kaye Thompson, and Don 
Hay, and Sophomore Bill Far
bacher.
Newcomers to the varsity are 
A1 Cerrito, Francis Kuenzig, Norbert Ackerman, and Jim Hunt. 
Kuenzig and Ackerman are fresh
men; Ackerman, a brother of 
Hans of last year. Cerrito has 
moved up from last years fresh
man squad where he was high 
scorer while Hunt is a transfer 
student from Washington and Jef
ferson, the Skibos traditional 
rival.
Frosh Crop
The current iresnman crop is 
reason for one of the brightest 
spots in the Carnegie basketball 
picture. In addition to Ackerman 
and Kuenzig, standouts Dosey, 
Jesske, Daniels, and Hyams on the 
frosh squad promise better basket
ball for Carnegie in the future.
Few changes have been made 
from the schedule the Tartans 
played last year. Dickinson and 
Duquesne have been dropped and 
Mt. Union and Penn State have 
been added to the Met.Patronize Tartan Advertisers
Cratsley And Fassinger 
Head Hoopsters Again
Like the Carnegie football organization, the Tartan basketball
of men who,spend most of their wakand the remainder with their charges
?------------:----------------------------------------
squad is coached by a group 
ing hours in earning a living, 
in the gymnasiuhi.
This year, as last, the CIT var
sity cagers will be coached by Mel 
Cratsley and Moe Fassinger. The 
freshman team, however, will be 
under the guidance of Mike Theo
dore, former Tartan star, who is 
taking over the post from Sergeant 
Ellwood Brown, who was recently 
transferred from Carnegie.
Holds Scoring: Record
Coach Cratsley, after serving 
two years as assistant coach under 
Bill Donahoe, took over the head 
coaching chores in 1950. He holds 
an ME degree from CIT, and while 
as a student played with the plaid 
floor squads of 1936 to 1939, dur
ing which time the Tartan five 
twice won the Eastern Intercol
legiate Basketball Championship.
He is the holder of the all-time 
Carnegie record for points scored 
per game, with a claim to 34 in a 
contest with West Virginia. Also 
a grid star in his college days, the 
Tartan coach played for Carnegies 
1938 Sugar Bowl eleven. His pres
ent duties here, when not acting as 
basketball mentor, are those of as
sistant director of the Carnegie 
Tech Bureau of Placements.
Fassinger Does Scouting
Moe Fassinger, first assistant to 
the head court coach, earns his 
living as office manager for a Pitts
burgh magazine distributing agen
cy. His past basketball experience 
includes playing with South Hills
high school, and several years with 
the Pittsburgh Municipal - league.
It is coach FaSsinger who sup
plies a preview of coming events 
to the Tartan squad by acting as 
scout for future opponents.
A Recent Graduate 
The new freshman coach, Mike 
Theodore, is a recent graduate erf 
Carnegie Tech, having received his 
BS in chemical engineering in 
1950. During his stay here, he 
played varsity basketball four 
years, and served as team captain 
the last three.
Mike holds the Carnegie record 
for most points scored in four 
years, with 1049, and came close 
to beating head Coach Cratsleys 
record for points per game when 
he dumped in a total of 33 mark
ers in one contest. He is presently 
employed as chemist in a local 
brewery.
Cratsley Fairly Optimistic 
Concerning his outlook on this 
years cagers, Mr. Cratsley de
scribed himself as fairly optim
istic, a statement which, when 
translated to the language of the 
layman, means, Id just as soon 
not stick my neck out by answer
ing that one. But it isnt the cus
tom among coaches to be overly 
enthusiastic at the outset of the 
season, so that faint ray of optim
ism may be a good sign. Only time 
can answer that one.

In Englewood, the local telephone exchange looks pretty much 
like the telephone building in any other town.
And Englewoods telephones seem just the same as the twentyseven million other dial telephones in the country.
But theres a difference . . .
You can pick up a telephone in Englewood and dial San Francisco 
telephone numbers direct!
In fact, you can dial any one of eleven million telephone numbers 
in thirteen widely scattered areas from coast to coast.
Thats what makes Englewood different - the new kind of Long 
Distance telephone service on trial there by the Bell System.
Long Distance dialing is another example of the Bell Systems 
constant search for ways to provide you with ever-better telephone

powered to confer degrees in special departments as arts, etc.; in 
the U. S. it is typically a college and one or more graduate or
-----------------------------------------------------?professional schools.
Carnegie Tech confers degrees 
in several fields, and is made up 
of fitfe colleges, Engineering and 
Science, Fine Arts, Margaret Mor- j 
rison, the Library School, and the | 
Industrial Administration school. 
It offers graduate work in engi
neering and science fields, secre
tarial studies, social work, drama, 
psychology, music, and industrial 
administration. In fact, consider 
the whole make-up of Carnegie 
and you will see that it more than 
fits the definition of a university.
Why then is the school called 
an institute of Technology?
When CIT was founded it was 
called the Carnegie Technical 
Schools and was modeled after the 
Keighley Technical School of Ertg* 
land, which is actuality was a 
trade school. The name Carnegie 
Institute of Technology was a 
name given to a full-fledged Engi
neering and science school.
To be sure, every course has 
certain technical aspects but such 
courses as history, languages, psy
chology, and social work hardly 
seem to be in accordance with the 
nameinstitute of technology.
Naturally difficulties would 
arise involving changes in songs 
and cheers, but then Carnegie In
stitute of Technology is quite a 
mouthful for a cheer anyway. 
Spell it out completely and the 
game is liable to be over before 
the cheer is finished.
For those readers of the Tartan and other Carnegie student 
publications who are weary of the standard diet of periodical litera
ture available at this institution, we have succeeded in compiling 
a list of reading matter which may be used as a substitute for, 
First of all, however, let it be*
plans to go carolling around the 
campus and top off the evening by 
a party for all the members.
EPS!
More BOUNCE To The Ounce
said that the discovery and study 
of departmental student publica
tions is not as easy as finding bul
letin boards isee Tartan, Nov. 20, 
1951), although the ratio of the 
former to the latter is under one 
to 30. Therefore, we offer our ab
ject apologies should any person 
or organization have been left out 
of this survey.
Large Charge Is Oldest 
Barring serious computational 
errors, there is a total of four pub
lications produced and consumed 
by CIT students, and which evolve 
from specific departments of the 
school.
Perhaps the oldest of these is 
the Large Charge, published by the 
electrical engineers, which was 
conceived early in 1946. This 
paper contains humorous, semihumorous, and downright serious 
material, such as articles, an
nouncements, jokes, and an occa
sional cartoon.
The Turbo-Incabulator 
It is sometimes hard to tell if 
an article is in earnest or not.
There has been a good deal of 
space devoted to an instrument 
known as the turbo-incabulator. 
Whether or not such a device ex
ists is a matter of conjecture, but 
if it does, it must be an extreme
ly useful gadget.
In the most recent issue can be 
found material ranging from a 
biography of an outstanding facul
ty member to an expose of the 
new Schmoe theory of relativity 
which might have proved a serious 
threat to Pogo if it had included 
illustrations.
Pienics and Professors 
Deep in the bowels of Engineer
ing Hall, in the realm of the 
metallurgists, is the home of the 
Ladle. This bit of literature also 
treats with all manner of topics, 
but with the slant toward metal
lurgy, as might be expected. The 
paper is complete with photo
graphs of picnics, professors, molt
en metal, and other liquids.
As might be expected, the CIT 
printers turn out a publication.

Day & Night Students 
Mix At Monte Carlo
The Monte Carlo Carnival, held by Evening Student Council on 
Saturday, November 17, in Thistle Hall, was a tremendous suc
cess. Evening students, their friends, and a large group of dayschool students all had a wonderful time, amid a setting of greenshaded lights, shining on gallop-*
ing dice and spinning wheels of 
chance.
It was amazing to see how fast 
some people could lose their 
money. When the gambling was 
finally over, after a last fifteen 
minutes of no limit playing, Pa
tricia Barthe, with 100,000 dol
lars won, was awarded the first 
prize for the girl making the high
est profits. She received a cer
tificate for a free portrait at Varden Studios.
Frank Kolano was awarded first 
prize for the fellow with the most 
w nnings, 17,000 dollars. He al
so received a certificate for a free 
portrait at Yarden Studios. The 
winner of the door prize, a por
trait at Stern Studio, was Mrs. 
William Bernhardi.

Throughout the evening, the 
guests also found diversion in 
continuous dancing in the beau
tifully decorated Black Cat lounge. 
In the Black Cat, itself, Will 
Schnarrenberger and his help
ers were kept busy serving re
freshments to thirsty customers.
A most entertaining feature was 
the white elephant auction, ably 
handled by Floyd Byers. Standing 
under a barrage of floodlights, he 
hammered up the prices on vari
ous articlessome really very 
usefulto thousands of dollars. 
Credit must be given to Marcella 
Sessi and Don Walker, who aid a 
fine job in securing and wrapping 
the white elephants.

News And Views
Benjamin H. Ayres, a former evening school engineering stu
dent, was recently congratulated on the occasion of his birthday in 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette column Pittsburghesque, penned by 
Charlie Danver.
Steven W. Marcinizyn, a past* --------------------------

Council, and part time instructor

at the East Pittsburgh Westinghouse plant.
Nice to see a slight change for 
the better in the weather. Now 
some of the students who travel 
from the more distant sections can 
^rive with a little more safety.
When you travel from Butler to 
Carnegie three nights a week as 
Harold Miller and Warren Ihlenfeld do, icy roads such as we had 
on Monday a few weeks ago, in 
addition to the usual traffic bottle
neck in Etna, make it a major un
dertaking to get to school.
Sometimes chemistry class pro
duces more laughs than a Milton 
Berle show. There was a discus
sion going on between Mr. Diethorn, evening school chemistry 
instructor, and George Schussier 
concerning the definition of a 
mole. After a long discussion, 
Mr. Diethorn stressed a technical 
point to which George wittily re
plied, Now isnt that making a 
mountain out of a mole?
To an argument on whether or 
not an empirical formula should 
be V03 or V205, Wiliam Julian 
of the same chemistry class re
marked, V.O. is pretty good no 
matter how you look at it.
