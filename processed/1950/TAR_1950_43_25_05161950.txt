That night Carnival hummed to 
the strains of Jack Purcells band 
at the street dance.
Tension mounted Saturday at 
the finals of the buggy competiThe formal dance was the icing 
on the Carnival cake. The ingred

Walt Harper, and silent movies 
were mixed thoroughly with 
smiles, dark tuxedoes and flimsy

After the two stupendous dances 
with the five greatsare over 
we would like to offer some con
structive criticism before the next
Carnival arrives. We feel that 
the choice of bands for the daiices 
was not on a par with that of 
previous Spring Carnival pro
grams. When we read the article 
in the Tartan about the five who 
were to provide the music for the 
dances this year we wondered if 
the committee was reverting to its 
previous policies of a decade ago 
when such mediocre bands as 
Glenn Miller and Harjpy James 
provided the music.
We suggest that the future com
mittees be appointed far enough 
in advance of Carnival that they 
may have sufficient time in which 
to make a better choice.
Another improvement which 
should be made in future Spring 
Carnival programs has to do with 
the location of the Friday night 
street dance. Although statistics 
prove that there are a few people 
with one leg slightly shorter than 
the other we do not feel that there 
are enough such people at Car
negie Tech to warrant holding the 
dance on an inclined dance floor. 
Our suggestion is to utilize the 
Fine Arts lawn and the portion 
of Margaret Morrison street di
rectly in front of the Fine Arts 
building. The bandstand could be 
placed on the lawn so that the 
band could be heard and seen both 
by those dancing in Margaret 
Morrison street (which, inciden
tally, is on the level) and by those 
just relaxing on chairs provided 
on the Fine Arts lawn and steps.

Outcome Of Match In Doubt Till Final Hole; 
Tartans To Host Grove City In Next Meet
Westminster College handed Coach Clarence (Buddy) Overends 
Carnegie Tech golf team its first defeat of the season last Wednes
day by a score of 12-6. The match was bitterly contested from start 
to finish, with the outcome in doubt until the last foursome had 
ended its tour of the Westminster ? 
course.
Wes Curtis and Rich Johnson 
collected most of the points for 
the locals. Johnsons 77 made 
him the Tartans medalist for 
the match, and he collected 2% 
out of a possible 3 points against 
the Titans number three man.
Curtis Scores
Curtis, posting a creditable 79 
over the eighteen hole layout, led 
off for the Plaid and held his 
Westminster opponent even for 
the match, with each man gaining 
IV2 points.
Ray Ryabik, Tartan number 
two golfer, fired a 79 for his days 
efforts but lost all three possible 
points to his opponent, who was 
medalist for the match with a 
75.
Points were awarded on the 
basis of one point for most holes 
won on the first nine holes, one 
for most holes won on the second 
nine, and one for the greatest 
number of holes won over the 
eighteen holes.
Johnson Stars
Johnson, playing the most con
sistent golf of any man on the 
team, held his opponent even over 
the first nine holes' and then went 
on to win the second nine as well 
as the eighteen, giving the Plaid 2x/2 points.
Varsity Tennis

Bethany, Grovers
Varsity tennis activities were 
curtailed by inclement weather 
last week, forcing the Tartan netmen out of action until yesterday 
when they were slated to meet 
Bethany College. The scheduled 
engagement with Geneva last 
Wednesday was postponed because 
of rain.
Undefeated in the first three 
matches, the Skibos will meet the 
University of Pittsburgh tomor
row on the Pitt courts, and then re
turn home on Saturday to take on 
Grove City. Pitt is expected to 
provide the strongest competition 
of the season for the Plaid.

Varsity Standout
Riehl, Oxley 
Given Tartan 
Sports Awards
Jack Riehl and Bill Oxley 
stepped into the sports spotlight 
in the middle of Spring Carnival 
and walked off with the Tartans 
awards to the outstanding varsity 
and intramural athletes of the 
year respectively.
Riehl, overlooked for a great 
part by the spectators because he 
played behind the citys highest 
scoring threat, was the man who 
came in to fill the ailing Mike 
Theodores scoring post last win
ter.
Always regarded as a dangerous 
opponent, by veteran coaches, it 
was not until recently that the 
public began to respect the tal
ents of the master ball handler.
Oxley, Theta Xis number one 
intramural athlete, was named as 
the top man on the campus by 
virtue of his abilities in the eight 
sports in which he competed, and 
his value to his team.
Particularly outstanding in 
touch football and wrestling, Ox
ley was for quite a long time man
ager of the TX teams. His sports
manship and leadership on the 
field of play were deciding factors 
in his selection.
Luchok, Hammann, Wilson Standout 
As Skibos Garner Ten First Places
Led once again by the incomparable Jim Andrews, the Carnegie 
Tech track team won its third meet of the season last Wednesday 
by defeating Geneva College at Beaver Falls by a 76% -54% score.
Andrews, competing against his former mates, scored 30 points 
for the Plaid, one of the greatest < - 
individual performances ever at
tained in track and field compe
tition. The New Brighton multi
man won five events and 
placed second in two others.
Ten Firsts
Coach Guy Halfertys Skibo 
trackmen rolled to 10 first places 
while limiting the Covenanters 
to five. After the first two events 
the outcome of the meet was 
never in doubt, as the Tartans 
continued to pile-up the points.
Andrews placed first in the 
120-yard low hurdles, pole vault, 
javelin, and broad jump. He also 
tied for first place with Connie 
Hammann in the high jump, and 
took second honors in the 100- 
yard dash and shot put.
Others Standout
Johnny Luchock and Hammann 
also were individual standouts.
Luchock won the 100-yard dash 
in 10.1 seconds, the best time he 
has shown all season. Hammann, 
besides his tie for first in the 
high jump, copped top honors in 
the 120-yard high hurdles, post
ing the creditable time of 16.2 
seconds.
Fritz Wilson once again led the 
field in the 220-yard dash, with a 
winning time of 23.9 seconds.
Bill McKibben followed Wilson 
across the finish line, with Carr 
of Geneva third.
George Dorman gave the Plaid 
another first by taking the 880- 
yard run in 2:07.2. The mile re
lay team of McKibben, Dorman,
Kurcina, and Price accounted for 
another first, winning in the good 
time of 3:42.2.
Many Score
Other Tartan point-makers 
were Carman, third in the mile 
run; Price and Kurcina, second 
and third respectively in the 440- 
yard dash; Wiewel, third in both 
the high and low hurdles, and 
Cooper, second in the two-mile 
run.
Emanon Takes 
Soccer Final 
Against Delts
Sudden Death Period 
Gives Victory Twice
In a repeat performance of last 
years play-offs, Delta Tau Delta 
met Emanon for the Intramural 
soccer championship Thursday. 
The Emanon six, in a thrilling sud
den death overtime, administered 
a 2-1 setback to the Delts to gain 
revenge for last years defeat.
Early in the game Emanon scored 
on a kick by Ray Carey. It was 
the only score in a game until late 
in the fourth period when Dick 
Neeley tied the game for the Delts 
with a penalty kick.
Sudden Death 
The game went into overtime, 
where the first team to register a 
score wins. It was then that Har
old Paxton of Emanon booted one 
through the goal to give Emanon 
the CIT intramural soccer cham
pionship.
v Emanon had earned the right to 
meet Delta Tau Delta, winner of 
the National league championship 
last week, by defeating their clos
est competitor in the American 
league, Theta Xi, 3-2 in another 
exciting game last Tuesday.
TX Topples 
Theta Xi took an early first per
iod lead on a- kick by Matthews, 
but Emanon came back with goals 
by Lee in the second period and 
Carey early^n the third period to 
take a 2-1 lead.
Late in the third period Walters 
for TX tied the score again at 2-2. 
The fourth period was scoreless, 
necessitating another sudden 
death overtime. In the period 
which followed Carey of Emanon 
kicked the winning tally.

Council.
Where's Power?
Councilman Moore wanted to 
know what could be done by 
Council to bring back to Carnegie 
a magazine like the Scottie. He 
was met by a chorus of abso
lutely nothing. This brought 
forth a Council is nothing; we 
are powerless speech from Mr. 
Moore. Councilman Holl quoted 
this by saying Council is respon
sible for campus publications 
budgets and that it wants maga
zines which can make money. He 
| said that the present Scot has a 
larger circulation than the Scottie 
did and- that the Scot has yet to 
lose as much as the Scottie on 
some of its issues.
Calendar Lost
The question of Morewood Gar
dens girls having to eat all their 
meals at the new cafeteria next 
year will get Council attention 
soon. Persons knowing the whole 
story will appear before Council 
next week. The girls object to 
the new plan because it will sep
arate them from their town class
mates as well as from CIT males. 
Many girls objected, too, because 
they don't want to have to eat 
three meals , a day.
An investigation to find out 
what happened to the printing of 
the social calendar uncovered the 
fact that it is lost somewhere 
along the administration's chain 
of command and that no steps 
have yet been made to get it 
; moving.
