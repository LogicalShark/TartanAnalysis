In the 
ROTC
Students in this program come 
out of CMU with not only a 
degree, but a commission too
by Isabel Gardocki
Staffwriter
The ROTC (Reserve Officers 
Training Corps) is part of the col
lege curriculum for 49 students at 
Carnegie Mellon. Through classes 
and training, students learn first
hand what it takes to lead others, 
motivate groups, and conduct 
missions. The Tartan spoke with 
first-year ROTC member Mark Capansky about his experiences with 
the program.
Tartan: I think that everyone 
gets those ROTC letters in the mail. 
Why did you choose to respond to 
it and do the ROTC program?
Capansky: I think that serving 
America is the right thing to do, 
and I wanted to be in the military. 
I know its kind of a stock answer, 
but I really believe that. I feel that 
Ive been given a lot of privileges, 
and I feel like I have a responsi
bility to pay them back. I always 
wanted to have an exciting career 
and this will help me accomplish 
that.
Tartan: So, what is the most 
stressful thing about the ROTC? Is 
it hard to manage your time?
Capansky: Its certainly stress
ful waking up early, but its some
thing you can deal with. When 
youre a first-semester freshman, 
its easy to screw up. You get things 
called write-ups. If you get a lot 
of write-ups you can get into trou
ble. It only gets more stressful be
cause as you get older, you get put 
in charge of more people. If they 
mess up, its your fault regardless 
of the situation.
Tartan: Write-ups? How exactly 
do you get those?
Capansky: By doing things 
like showing up late to Physical

Meet the presidential candidates
by Brittany McCandless
Asst. News Editor
Having turned in their elec
tion petitions last week, Student 
Body Presidential and VicePresidential candidates are well 
underway in campaigning for 
the elections on April 4 and 5.
Launching websites and 
Facebook groups dedicated to 
their campaigns, three teams 
of candidates are running on 
the ticket for the student body 
government positions. Rachel 
Gross, a junior majoring in busi
ness and technical writing and 
communications, is running for 
President with Ben Hackett, a 
junior majoring in social and 
decision sciences, as her VicePresidential candidate. Also 
running for President is Tom 
Sabram, a junior chemical engi
neering major; his running mate 
is Nicolette Louissaint, a junior 
in chemical engineering and bi
ology. The third pair consists of 
Franklin Williams, a junior in so
cial and decision sciences, run
ning for President, with Jackie 
Brook, a junior majoring in pro
fessional and creative writing, as 
his running mate.
In interviews with The Tartan, 
the candidates articulated the 
issues and ideas central in their 
campaigns.

Rachel Gross and Ben Hackett
Gross and Hackett emphasize 
the need for communication 
among campus organizations 
in order to confront larger cam
pus issues, such as dining and 
housing. The pair stresses the
need for organizations to better 
promote their positive activities, 
and they offer ideas to promote 
University athletics and cultural 
events on campus.
Tartan: What are some of 
the issues and concerns on 
campus?
Gross: Of course everyone 
is going to say dining, parking 
and housing  the same issues 
and concerns that weve had 
as long as the campus has been 
around. But what Ive been able 
to identify by talking to differ
ent student organizations and 
other students is that at the
heart of the problem is commu
nications.... Everyone talks to 
the same people and has their 
ideas of what the problems are, 
but theres no cross communica
tion.... I feel that before were 
able to tackle the problems like

New FCEs yield mixed student results
by Ben Hackett
Junior Staffwriter
Recent changes to the Faculty 
Course Evaluation (FCE) pro
cess have dramatically changed 
its purpose and design. The new 
FCEs are designed to provide 
better input than the previous 
edition. As in prior versions, 
these evaluations are voluntary. 
A major change, however, is stu
dents new opportunity to fill out 
the FCEs online.
Response rates, initially a 
concern, did not appear to dif
fer from the pre-change rates at 
first. Data is available from two 
pilot studies and two summer 
sessions. The online version re
cords a 46.5 percent response 
rate, while the old pencil-andpaper method had a 52 percent 
response rate.
As pointed out by the FCE 
website, the pencil-and-paper 
method had huge swings in re
sponse rates from class to class. 
The response rates in different 
courses ranged from 16 percent 
to 100 percent. Defenders of the 
online deployment cite studies
from other universities that show 
a rise in response rates as stu
dents become more accustomed 
to answering the FCE online.
These rates are also depen
dent on completion times. The 
old FCEs took 2 or 3 minutes 
to complete. The new FCEs are 
lengthier, and, as the FCE web
site states, may take as long as 
10 minutes to complete. Similar 
to the older version, online FCEs 
will not affect students grades 
in any manner. These evalua
tions are submitted after final 
grades are entered. While users 
are required to enter their An
drew IDs and passwords, there 
are assurances that no personal 
association is stored with the 
comments. The submissions of 
the evaluations are anonymous.
The issue of privacy online 
versus the more private feel of 
the pencil-and-paper version is 
addressed in the FCE policy on 
privacy. Students are required 
to log in with their Andrew in
formation to enter the FCE form, 
but this is simply to make sure 
students are commendng on 
courses in which they have par
ticipated. As per the FCE privacy
policy: Once you begin filling 
out an evaluation, your Andrew 
ID and any other personally 
identifying information are dis
carded. Data collected from your 
responses does not contain per
sonally identifying information, 
though some information you 
provide in your responses could 
provide potential clues to your 
instructors.
The format of the new FCEs 
hews to the main principles of 
the former. However there are 
plans to make sections such 
as Student Effort & Participa
tion, The Course, and Learning 
Outcomes customizable. In this 
case, students would be able to 
edit items by their elimination or 
addition. This option is intended 
to address those questions in the 
FCE that are not appropriate for 
particular courses.
The new program is a topic 
of debate with professors and 
students alike. Susan Ambrose, 
CMUs Associate Provost for Ed
ucation, spoke of the changes, 
saying, We were quite pleased 
with the first full implementa
tion ... [There were] not many 
problems and a pretty decent
response rate given that its both 
a new instrument and a new sys
tem. The new system, she says, 
features easy acccess and makes 
the results easy to view. Interest
ing statistics are available imme
diately: those such as the overall 
instructor ratings by college are 
readily available.
Results are available shortly 
after the final grades are sub
mitted. At that point all results 
for classes at Carnegie Mellon 
participating in the program are 
accessible. These new features 
are designed to help in reach
ing the programs overall goal of 
enabling teachers to refine their 
courses in an attempt to better 
their teaching.
However, user reaction to the 
new FCEs is split. Paul Day, a 
junior in mechanical engineer
ing, said: I prefer the old FCEs, 
where we filled out a sheet of 
paper in class. Whats my moti
vation to go online to fill out the 
new ones, especially when they 
take about 10 minutes apiece? 
Multiply that by five or six class
es for the average student, and 
youre asking students for a good 
chunk of their time.
Gladiator research 
raises awareness of 
ethical issues
by Alexander Meseguer
Layout Manager
We turn dollars into knowl
edge, said Matthew Mason, di
rector of Carnegie Mellon Univer
sitys Robotics Institute. I look at 
[each potential project] as how it 
advances our goals in robotics.
In February, the Institute ac
cepted a contract to develop 
Gladiator, a robotic 
remote-control 
ground vehicle NeWS 
which has the 
potential to save
the lives of sol__
diers dealing with 
deadly situations. According to 
researchers, the vehicle can spot 
enemies from hundreds of yards 
and see in ways people cant. The 
contract is worth $26.4 million 
and would support the research 
of four or five graduate students. 
What sets this project apart from 
others, however, is its potential to 
use direct fire capability to neu
tralize threats.
Although CMU is not directly 
developing any of Gladiators 
offensive capabilities, the robot 
and others like it raise new ques
tions as to where the line should 
be drawn for collegiate military 
research. There are many who 
claim they deserve a hand in 
drawing the line, and who ex
actly does the drawing in aca
demia is unclear. But one thing is 
sure: students will feel the conse
quences.
Students are at the center of the 
issue. They worry about choos
ing theses, conducting research, 
and finally, getting jobs. Whether 
they are denied research oppor
tunities because of their citizen
ship status, are included in mili
tary projects willingly, or avoid 
them out of personal choice, the 
presence of military research is a 
windfall for some and a blight for 
others.
Students dont study in a vac
uum. The choices of administra
tors and project managers affect 
them profoundly. Dimitrios Apostolopoulos, the Robotics Institute 
scientist in charge of Gladiator,
sees his work as an opportunity 
to serve his country and provide 
raw material for graduate de
grees.
We should be helping to im
prove the national security of the 
United States. [It is] almost a civ
ic duty, said Apostolopoulos in 
a telephone interview. Person
ally, there is no difference in my 
mind between a DARPA program 
and a NASA program. There are
Analysis
Military Research
probably thousands of PhDs and 
masters students who have come 
out from CMU having worked on 
[military-funded] projects.
The debate, though, is far from 
one-sided.
Whats it ultimately about? 
Its about building weapons, 
said David Meieran, a member of 
the Pittsburgh Organizing Group 
(POG) and former philosophy 
doctoral student. Meieran is a 
life-long activist, having spent 
most of the last two decades 
campaigning to promote AIDS 
awareness and gay rights. Hes 
given up the typical post-college 
life of a Carnegie Mellon student, 
living hand-to-mouth and bor
rowing money from his friends 
to pay for trips to demonstrations 
and protests. Its sanitized war
fare ... reducing the casualties on 
the U.S. side makes going to war 
easier.... The country that goes to 
war should take the moral issue 
seriously.
Thats a fair argument, in a 
way, but at the same time, with 
Gladiator, with a Marine carrying 
out orders, hes not making the 
policy, hes carrying out orders, 
said Apostolopoulos in a sepa
rate interview. To me, its a very 
worthy mission [to help them]. 
Of course its a tough issue, we 
all have opinions. You know, war 
is not a good thing. But were 
not going to say were not going

Presidential perspectives: What will you do after graduation?
rik Michaels-Ober
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung once 
wrote, Creative powers can just as easily 
turn out to be destructive. It rests solely 
with the moral personality whether they 
apply themselves to good things or to 
bad.
As hundreds of graduating Carnegie 
Mellon students prepare to enter the 
workforce, they are confronted with the 
choice of applying their education to 
either good things or to bad, to creation 
or to destruction.To encourage students to consider this 
decision, colleges and universities across 
the nation have adopted the Graduation
Pledge of Social and Environmental Re
sponsibility. It reads, I pledge to explore 
and take into account the social and en
vironmental consequences of any job I 
consider and will try to improve these 
aspects of any organization for which I 
work.
This pledge is voluntary and allows 
students to determine for themselves 
what they consider socially and environ
mentally responsible. Students who take 
the pledge typically wear green ribbons 
on commencement day as a public state
ment of their commitment to social and 
environmental responsibility, both be
fore and after being hired.
Graduates who sign the pledge pur
sue careers in organizations that seek 
to create positive change in our society. 
Even with a difficult job market, some
may turn down lucrative offers that go 
against their ethical principles. Others 
have worked to make changes once on 
the job, by promoting recycling at their 
organization, removing racist language 
from training manuals, working for gen
der parity, or advocating health benefits 
to same-sex domestic partners.
The student government and the 
Green Practices Committee will be co
hosting a forum this Friday at 4:30 pm in 
McConomy Auditorium to discuss how 
the Graduation Pledge of Social and En
vironmental Responsibility should be 
incorporated into Carnegie Mellon com
mencement exercises. I encourage you 
to attend this forum, even if you will not 
be graduating this May.
The Graduation Pledge of Social and 
Environmental Responsibility began in
1987 at Humboldt State University in 
California. It is now used at over 100 col
leges and universities, including, Colum
bia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Harvard, 
MIT, Princeton, Stanford, and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. The Graduation 
Pledge Alliance (GPA), a consortium of 
these schools, currently coordinates the 
nationwide campaign.
For more information, visit the GPAs 
website at www.graduationpledge.org.
The Student Body President has resched
uled his office hours this week to attend 
a presentation by our guests from the 
Qatar campus. Please do not hesitate to 
visit him today between 4:30 and 6:30 
pm in the University Center 318F, or 
e-mail pres@cmu.edu to schedule an

Executive
Privilege
/a
/ Bradford L. Yankiver
Next Monday and Tuesday we will 
elect the Student Body President (SBP), 
Student Body Vice-President (SBVP), 
Vice-President for Finance (VPF), and 
Student Senators. The students who 
fill these roles routinely dedicate long 
hours to their jobs, but most of the stu
dent population is unaware of their 
work. In electing students to represent 
us, we give them the lead role in advo
cating on our behalf. But only excep
tional candidates will make good use of 
this opportunity, so even if its the only 
time this year, pay some attention to 
student government.
To help the student body learn more 
about the candidates for SBP and SBVP, 
The Tartan is providing extended cov
erage of the candidates campaigns in 
both the News and Forum sections of 
this issue. Additionally, WRCT, cmuTV, 
and The Tartan are co-sponsoring a 
debate this Thursday at 5 pm in McCo
nomy Auditorium. Audio from the de
bate will be broadcast live on 88.3 FM, 
and video will be available on cmuTV 
(channel 17 in on-campus University 
Housing) and online at The Tartans 
website.
One of the sets of candidates for 
SBP and SPVP is Franklin Williams 
and Jackie Brook, respectively. Frank
lin is currently the Managing Editor of 
The Tartan, and Jackie is the Forum 
Editor. In a community of students as 
driven and hard-working as ours, it 
is inevitable that some students will 
find themselves wanting to contrib
ute to the community in various roles. 
In this case, however, editors of the 
newspaper are running for an elected 
office; because of this conflict of in
terest, we are taking this matter very 
seriously.
Franklin and Jackie have recused 
themselves from editorial board meet
ings regarding any content related 
to the election; the news coverage of 
the candidates was assigned to one of 
our most consistent and professional 
writers; and our editors are double
checking all content to weed out any 
bias or favoritism. Finally, we have 
teamed with two other major campus 
media organizations to produce the 
debate historically sponsored by The 
Tartan alone. All question writing is 
done privately, and no candidate will 
have advance knowledge of the ques
tions. Finally, while The Tartan has 
traditionally provided the moderator 
for the'debate, cmuTV president Greg 
Battaglia will moderate this year.
Turning to other matters, you may 
notice that Crime and Incident has 
been replaced by national news briefs 
this week. The Tartan regrets being un
able to provide the community with its 
usual weekly security review.
Early last semester, Campus Police 
amended its policy on communicat
ing with campus media organizations. 
The Tartan once received complete 
police reports, with sensitive informa
tion blacked out. Under the new policy, 
Campus Police provides a summary 
report: the nature, date, time, and gen
eral location of each crime, and the 
disposition of the complaint, if known 
 the details federally mandated to 
be released in 34 CFR Ch. VI 668.48. 
Campus Police typically sends this 
report to several campus media orga
nizations, but did not do so last week. 
Since the new policy came into effect, 
The Tartan has repeatedly faced dif
ficulties in coordinating with Campus 
Police. We will continue to work on 
ensuring that we can provide the cam
pus with a weekly review of securityrelated matters.
Finally, Science and Technology 
returns in this issue after a one-week 
. absence. The position of Science and 
Technology Editor is presently vacant. 
Unfortunately, until the position is 
filled, the section will be run on a 
bi-weekly basis. Undergraduate and 
graduate students are welcome to apply 
for the position by submitting a cover 
letter, resum, and writing sample to 
exec@thetartan.org or to mailbox 119 
at the UC Information Desk.

THE TARTAN  MARCH 28, 2005Candidates share their views on campus problems
ELECTION, from A1
dining, housing, and controversial 
speakers, we need to open up the 
airwaves so that we can all com
municate together because, from 
what Ive been hearing, were all 
fighting for the same thing.
Tartan: How do you plan to 
close the gaps between organiza
tions?
Gross: One thing that Ive been 
talking about a lot with differ
ent organizations is the need for 
those organizations to really pro
mote the positive things that they 
do.... I also think that student 
government can work toward 
promoting non-academic events 
on campus.... Ive heard a lot of 
talk about the lack of support for 
athletics, and one of our ideas is 
to create an athletics awards cer
emony, where we recognize ex
ceptional student athletes in the 
greater CMU community, not just 
within the athletic community....
The other thing is the College 
of Fine Arts that is often really 
separated, and what Ive labeled 
as the campus divide... We need 
to publicize those more and to 
make students aware of the op
portunities of the fine arts events 
on campus.
Tartan: How would you tackle 
the diversity and tolerance issues 
weve been having?
Gross: What we need to do is 
work on the communication as
pect, work on having students 
input on what speakers come to 
campus, and make sure that stu
dents are aware that they have 
someone to talk to. If they have a 
problem or concern, the admin
istration is there to talk to them. 
By opening the communication 
waves, its my hope that people
will be able to learn about other 
cultures and other people, and 
through that education, make a 
good judgment about the way stu
dents and organizations should 
conduct themselves on campus.
Hackett: Ive served this year 
on the diversity committee on 
Student Senate ... Im constantly 
thinking on the point of the dan
gers of diversity without diversity 
of thought....
Its one thing to protect the 
rights of students to bring a con
troversial speaker or to say any
thing they want on campus.... 
However, I think that when the 
very concept of diversity is used 
over and over, sometimes the di
versity of thought gets left to the 
side.... Its really about peoples 
right to think and act in a manner 
they see fit.
Tom Sabram and 
Nicolette Louissaint
Sabram and Louissaints plat
form extends from addressing 
upperclassmen meal plans to cre
ating ad hoc committees for non
government-affiliated students 
to voice their opinions. The pair, 
who wants to change the location 
of the Presidents office hours to a 
more prominent location, intend 
to work closely with the Student 
Senates multicultural council.
Tartan: How do you think your 
being in a fraternity will influence 
your decisions and policies in of
fice?
Sabram: Personally I feel that 
since about 16 percent of campus 
is Greek, you need to remember 
that 16 percent and look out for 
them as well, but you also need to 
make decisions that are wise for 
the whole student body. I feel that 
the general feeling of the Greek
community has taken a hit this 
year with all of the recent events, 
and those need to be addressed 
to the Greek community and try 
to combine the presidents of the 
chapters and the administration 
and make sure theyre on the 
same page.
Tartan: What do you think are 
the issues on campus that you 
think are important?
Sabram: I would say diversity 
is one of the biggest issues. With 
the Natrat incident a year ago 
and Shabazz this year, we saw 
how there are these underlying 
issues that havent really been ad
dressed. Theyre still there, and 
wed like to change that.
I would say 
diversity 
is one of the 
biggest 
issues.
-Tom Sabram
Wed also like to work on din
ing. We know that the Parkhurst 
contract expires at the end of the 
2006 academic year, and wed like 
to ... get some new ideas and new 
vendors in there ... and lay the 
groundwork so that something 
new can be brought in....
Also we oppose any mandatory 
meal plan for upper-class stu
dents in University housing un
less theres a drastic improvement 
in the quality of food.
Tartan: What are some new 
ideas youd bring to the office?
Sabram: Wed like to work 
closer with the city of Pittsburgh 
and the City Council, specifically 
councilman Bill Peduto. This year, 
with the near cuts of a drastic 
portion of transit funding, we re
alized that a better working rela
tionship needs to happen with the 
council so that we can be abreast 
of whats happening on council 
and how that may affect CMU 
students. We want to make it a 
two-way street, where were also 
a part of the city of Pittsburgh, 
and they realize it as well.
Tartan: What are some of your 
ideas to bridge campus groups?
Loussaint: I would like to in
corporate more than just cultural 
awareness organizations. Its 
about using that opportunity to 
get a lot of the influential campus 
leaders in one room at the same 
time and say, You have the re
sponsibility and you now have 
the opportunity to plan events 
together, to network with each 
other and to get to know each 
other.... It would be fabulous 
to see organizations coming to
gether and linking up. I think the 
multi-cultural advisory council is 
a way for that to happen... [We 
can] put the wheels in motion by 
having ad hoc committees that 
have, instead of broadly ranging 
goals and objectives, they have 
realistic goals.
Franklin Williams and 
Jackie Brook
Williams and Brook assert that 
they are campaigning for issues 
other candidates are not ad
dressing. Rather than addressing 
housing and dining specifically, 
Williams and Brook want to hold
events during which the leaders 
of campus organizations are re
quired to speak their minds, and 
the pair wants to implement lead
ership programs, particularly the 
heads of campus organizations.
Tartan: What are the issues 
you would like to address?
Williams: Theres been a lot 
of talk with certain buzz words 
such as the campus divide, and 
I feel that the best way to start 
approaching ideas like this are 
to literally open doors to people 
who can actually deal with them. 
Rather than waiting for people to 
come approach us, [we would] 
actually hold events where people 
can come and speak their minds 
and get things on the table... 
the groups that are really suffer
ing right now are the ones that 
should be required to come and 
discuss things with each other... 
Weve seen with the Natrat and 
Shabazz that these issues exist 
but theyre being ignored. Theyre 
put on the table, and then theyre 
pushed aside and forgotten 
about. I think the best way to fix 
that is to get knowledge circulat
ing, whether through forums or 
making knowledge accessible.
Tartan: What are some of the 
ideas youd like to implement?
Williams: First theres the firstyear leadership program, which is 
a great program for first-year stu
dents, but the problem is that once 
you leave that first-year program, 
youre suddenly put in a situation 
where theres no real inter-group 
community. Theres no real way to 
actually sit down and discuss the 
issues... A lot of people have ad
dressed dining, and housing and 
parking and whatnot, but I think 
right now those arent the largest 
issues. They are being dealt by
the people who are supposed to 
be dealing with them. There are 
boards, chairs and committees set 
up for that. I think that the largest 
issue is getting people together to 
learn to work together as opposed 
to working separately.
Tartan: There has been some 
concern that you will run on a 
Tartan ticket, as you are both in 
editorial positions on The Tartan. 
Do you have a response for these 
concerns?
Brook: While I understand 
the concern of a Tartan ticket, I 
dont believe the fears to be found
ed. Frankie and I have not, and 
will not, push a Tartan agenda. 
Personally, I think we have an ad
vantage as Tartan staff members; 
were always in the know about 
news on campus and have had 
success working as a team in a 
professional arena. However, The 
Tartan has remained non-partisan in this election, as it declines 
throwing its support towards any 
candidate, Frankie and myself in
cluded.
For more detailed information 
about the candidates platforms 
and positions on campus issues, 
students should attend open de
bates next week. On Tuesday, a 
Vice-Presidential debate will be 
held in the Mudge lounge at 7:30 
pm; The Tartan along with WRCT 
and cmuTV will host a Presiden
tial debate next Thursday at 5 pm 
in McConomy.
Editors Note: Franklin Williams is 
the Managing Editor of The Tartan. 
Jackie Brook is the Forum Editor of 
The Tartan. Ben Hackett is also a 
staffwriter for The Tartan. None of 
the candidates have had input into 
the editing or added content of this 
article, and precautions have been 
taken to eliminate all feasible bias.
ROTC students train, travel while taking classes
ROTC, from Al
Training, or not showing proper 
respect to a superior. Five or six 
write-ups can potentially mess up 
your ROTC career and just give 
you a bad reputation. But, they 
dont ask for more than we can do. 
You just have to pay attention.
Tartan: It sounds like theres 
a lot more to being in the ROTC 
than the average student knows. 
What does it entail?
Capansky: When you first join 
up in your freshman year, you 
come a little bit early in the sum
mer. You go to orientation where 
you go learning about military 
life. For example, they teach you 
how to salute.
Once you get to school, you 
have Physical Training (PT). We 
meet in Skibo gym and do a fairly 
intense workout. Workouts start 
at 5:45 in the morning and were 
usually done by 7:15 or 7:30 by
the latest. We also have lab on 
Thursday mornings (6:45 am) 
where well get some kind of pre
sentation on military life. And we 
also take military classes on mili
tary knowledge and history.
Theres a lot of other outside 
events that the ROTC does. Other 
people will join the Drill Team, 
where we march around and take 
part in competitions. Im in the 
Color Guard, which presents the 
U.S. flag at special events. Also, 
there is a big event in the sum
mer when you spend a month 
on Summer Cruise. You live on 
a base and youll go to different 
ones depending on whichever 
warfare community you are in.
Tartan: Okay, so the burning 
question: Why do you wear your 
uniforms to class?
Capansky: Well, once you get 
into the military, youll be wear
ing uniforms every day for a
while. You might as well get used 
to it while youre in college. It 
gives us a sense of preparation. 
Were going to be on active duty 
after college for four years. The 
actual requirement is four years 
of active duty and four years of 
inactive duty. We can be told that 
we are going to go back into ac
tive duty at any point during the 
inactive duty, depending on the 
needs of the country. Aviators 
need to spend all eight years in 
active duty. Its because so much 
money goes into training avia
tors that they want to get the full 
value of it.
Tartan: That doesnt sound like 
itd be the most popular program. 
Is it?
Capansky: Everyone watches 
Top Gun, so they want to be like 
that. CMU is actually most well 
known for sending people into 
the submarine warfare program. 
You need to be extremely smart to

Tartan: Really? Is that what 
youre planning to do?
Capansky: No. Right now Im in 
the Navy, but Im thinking about 
switching into the Marines.
Tartan: Do you have a greatest 
fear about being in the ROTC?
Capansky: Were so far de
tached from everything going on 
in the outside world that I cant 
say Im afraid of getting called 
up. But in any case, thats what 
were here to do. I truly believe 
that anyone in the ROTC would 
proudly go. Theres the potential 
that anyone, except for the fresh
men, can be enlisted at any time. 
Thats very unlikely, but I have no 
doubt that everyone here would 
proudly go.
Tartan: Thats really honor
able. But, on a lighter topic, what
is the strangest rule in the ROTC?
Capansky: Um, therere some 
screwy ones. It seems that you 
can never be early enough. No 
matter how early you think you 
are. Also, if we see an ROTC stu
dent of higher ranking well still 
call him Sir, even if we just see 
him in the street. Thats not that 
weird, really, but different.
Tartan: Ive often seen ROTC 
people marching in tandem. Do 
you practice how to walk in step 
like that often?
Capansky: Usually you learn 
that your first semester of your 
freshman year, once or twice 
a week. Youll practice more if 
youre on the drill team.
Tartan: What about the slack
ers? Is there anything people do 
that can get them kicked out?
Capansky: Theres something
called being uncommisionable. 
If you physically cant become an 
officer, theyll ask you to leave the 
program. Its not that program 
is being mean, its just that you 
arent able to be in it, so theres 
no reason for the government to 
be paying you anymore. For ex
ample: asthma. What if youre in 
a stressful situation that brings 
on an attack? Its things like that. 
Theres also honor code infrac
tions. Were all under an honor 
code; if someone breaks that, its 
possible that we can be told to 
leave the program.
Tartan: What about the
money? Do you get paid for being 
in the ROTC?
Capansky: If you become a 
scholarship student, you get 
full tuition paid and you get a 
monthly stipend. The stipend 
is 250 dollars monthly in your 
freshman year and then it in
creases. t
Gladiator remains tricky topic
ETHICS, from A1
front lines. Apostolopoulos laid 
down a clear boundary for the 
kind of research he would be a 
part of. If someone were to ask 
,me to develop a system to de
velop the accuracy of a weapon, I 
wouldnt do it. If someone were to 
ask me to develop an autonomous 
navigation system for a mine, I 
wouldnt do it.
With contracts like Gladia
tor, the conversation on ethics 
doesnt stop with the academic in 
charge. When pressed for details 
on which moral and ethical issues 
discussed, Robotics Institute di
rector Matt Mason refused to 
elaborate beyond saying they had 
discussed all aspects of the proj
ect. Mason added that research 
done at Carnegie Mellon is being 
done by people who love robotics 
and publish the work and apply 
what they learn to other applica
tions.
Regardless of where the re
search is done, military research 
is seen as controversial. For stu
dents like Christopher Sequeira, 
a senior in aerospace engineering 
at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, the issue is a fact of 
scholarly life.
The military tends to fund 
things around here, said Se
queira, who is also since last year 
a member of MIT Student Pugwash, a campus group dedicated 
to promoting social responsibility 
in science and technology. I dont
see MIT as a particularly activist 
type of campus. He added that 
its not necessarily an apathetic 
environment, but students usu
ally go about their day without 
being confronted with political 
messages. He recalled an annual 
contest sponsored by MITs Insti
tute for Soldier NanotechnoloThe military tends to fund things around here.
-Christopher 
Sequeira at MIT
gies in which materials science 
students submitted designs for 
body armor. Two years ago there 
was some outcry, said Sequeira, 
about the ethics and applications 
of the research.
Classified research offers stu
dents the opportunity to travel 
in the professional world. But the 
classified work done at places like 
MIT and at high-tech government 
jobs often carries restrictions in
volving circumstances beyond the 
students control. Many gradu
ate students in MITs aerospace 
department arent from the U.S.,
said Sequeira. At a recent job fair, 
Boeing said its better to be a citi
zen because it opens up a whole 
lot of projects,for you. I would 
definitely say that most of the 
opportunities and cutting edge 
research is done by the military. 
So if youre not a citizen, your 
options are pretty limited. Other 
areas [outside of aerospace] have 
more opportunities.
Gladiator wont be as selective. 
Only students who are perma
nent residents of the U.S. will be 
permitted to work on the project, 
according to Apostolopoulos. Ac
cording to the CMU 2005 Fact 
Book, 43 percent of robotics stu
dents at the School of Computer 
Science are non-resident aliens or 
international students and, as a 
result, are not able to be involved 
in projects like Gladiator.
On March 19, the day before 
the march to mark the second an
niversary of the war in Iraq, pro
testers chalked WAR MACHINE 
across 20 feet of concrete in front 
of Warner Hall along with a giant 
arrow pointing to the doors of 
Carnegie Mellons administration 
building. Students will have to de
cide for themselves whether they 
pay any attention to this label.
At MIT, Sequeira will be doing 
the same for his own school. If 
I come back for grad studies, Ill 
have to think about funding my
self, where my funding is going 
to come from, and where my re
search goes after the fact.

New gene imaging technique peers into living tissue
by Hanadie Yousef
Junior Staffwriter
CMU scientists, in collabora
tion with the Pittsburgh Nuclear 
Magnetic Research Center for 
Biomedical Research, have de
veloped new magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) technology that 
will allow doctors and scientists 
to visualize the expression of 
specific genes in live tissue. This 
is the first time technology is 
under development that will al
low scientists to monitor gene 
expression in live organisms, 
without having to sacrifice the 
organism.
Our new MRI technology can 
be used in a variety of appli
cations, says Dr. Eric Ahrens, 
assistant professor of biological 
sciences in the Mellon College 
of Science at Carnegie Mellon. 
It can be used to specifically 
show if initial conditions and 
locations of gene delivery were 
as expected.
Ahrens manipulated mamma
lian cells to make them produce 
their own contrast agent, a sub
stance that will allow a particu
lar tissue to be more visible to an 
MRI scan. He then inserted the 
gene that produces ferritin, a 
non-toxic protein that binds iron, 
into the cells. This metalloprotein 
acts like a nano-magnet, causCourtesy of Dr. Eric Ahrens
(1) A gene encoding for an iron-storage protein acts like a nano-magnet and a potent MRI reporter. (2) The MRI 
reporter gene is incorporated into an engineered virus that acts as a delivery vehicle. The vehicle carrying the MRI 
reporter gene is injected into brain of a subject. (3) When the subject is placed in an MRI magnet, the brain cells that 
contain the reporter gene can be identified and imaged at high resolution.
ing the nearby protons to give 
off a distinctly different signal, 
which is detectable to the MRI.
Ahrens use of ferritin as a con
trast agent is similar to the use of 
green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
in the detection of gene expres
sion, but ferritin can be used in 
in vivo applications (those in
volving live subjects), allowing 
full scale, high resolution imag
ing of the gene of interest.
[Ahrens] is able to detect pro
tein in living organisms without 
having to sacrifice the animal. 
Thats the beauty of it, because 
in a sense its non-invasive, 
says Dr. Danith Ly, an assistant 
professor of chemistry at CMU.
The new gene imaging tech
nology allows for the detection
of any given protein at any given 
time. The technology leaves a 
wide range of possible appli
cations, including many for 
therapeutic gene delivery re
search.
Ferritin, when attached to 
a specific gene, is delivered to 
specific tissue in an organism 
via modified viruses that cant 
replicate. This MRI technology 
proves a convenient method 
of monitoring the pathway of 
the gene under examination, to 
make sure it ends up in the cor
rect places within the body.
This is a platform technol
ogy  it can be adapted for use 
in many cell types and for cell 
therapies, and can even eventu
ally be used in humans, says
Mangala Srinivas, a doctoral stu
dent in Ahrens lab.
Ferritin produces a natural 
protein and is non-toxic, allow
ing cells to readily take it up. 
Fusing ferritin to a specific gene, 
however, may prove detrimental 
to that genes natural expression 
and function in cells. This has 
been the case in many molecular 
markers used, to detect genetic 
activity in the past. Other ob
stacles to using this new gene 
imaging technology will vary 
depending on the specific appli
cation. Only time will tell if the 
new technology will have a fu
ture in the research world; until 
scientists apply it in pre-clinical 
trials, they will be unable to pre
dict all potential problems.
Dr. Ahrens applied his unique 
background in physics to the 
development of this new gene 
imaging technology. Ahrens 
received both his bachelors 
and PhD in physics, switching 
into the field of biology as a 
postdoctoral researcher at 
Caltech. His previous work in 
the field of physics includes 
NMR and superconductors.
Dr. Ahrens started working 
for CMU in 2000, and quickly 
became interested in MRI re
search. Switching into the field 
of molecular biology, he was 
able to apply his prior knowl
edge of spin physics to his bio
logical research. Ahrens diverse 
educational background has al
lowed him to excel in a field 
where expertise in physics is not 
the norm. I was able to apply 
my expertise across the disci
plines, which if you look in the 
past is often the case with sci
entific breakthroughs, says Dr. 
Ahrens.
Ahrens work is a break
through in biosensor detections, 
says Ly, who works in the chem
istry department but whose re
search on gene delivery tools 
extends beyond the barriers of 
disciples and into molecular bi
ology and therapeutic research. 
This is a real biomedical appli
cation with great potential.
How Things Work: Shampoo
William Nicoll
Millions of years ago, man was cov
ered in hair.
With so much hair to go around, 
it wasnt given much attention. Cavedwellers were covered in a matted, oily 
hairstylists nightmare. Over the years, 
evolution has caused our hair to recede 
all the way to the tops of our heads.
Today, many cherish their hair as 
if every day would be its last, and an 
entire industry of hair care products 
has sprung up to cater to this craze. 
There are waxes, gels, mousses, sprays, 
colorings, washes, and everything inbetween that can give hair any look 
imaginable. The most important of 
these, however, is also the simplest: 
shampoo.
We know of shampoos today as a 
liquid product meant for cleaning hair. 
According to the FDA, shampoo is actu
ally a cosmetic, unless it is intended 
to treat a medical condition such as 
dandruff or lice (in which case you have 
bigger problems than the governments 
definition of shampoo). As simple as 
shampoo may seem, it isnt very easy 
to concoct. Imagine that you are the 
lead scientist for Head & Shoulders. 
The CEO and marketing managers call 
you into the conference room. Its time 
we get down to brass tacks, they say. 
We need you to design us a totally new 
shampoo. That damn Herbal Essences 
and its clever, sexy marketing is ruining 
us! We want a shampoo that will make 
our customers scream out in ecstasy 
too! Such a task is easier said than 
done. Putting aside marketing, what do 
customers look for in a shampoo?
First and foremost, it must clean
ones hair and remove oil. At the same 
time it must not be so harsh that it re
moves the hairs natural oils. It must be 
non-toxic if ingested in small quantities. 
Its formulation cant sting the eyes too 
much. It must have proper viscosity: not 
too runny, but not too thick that it cant 
be spread easily. It must lather the hair 
enough to satisfy buyer image. And it 
must look and smell appealing.
Finally, this completed product must 
last on store shelves for months.
How is all this done?
Certainly not with one single wonder 
chemical! There is no deity that rains
Danielle Saudino/Art Editor
down shampoo mixes like manna from 
Heaven. Lets take a look at some of the 
main ingredients of shampoo.
Cleaning ones hair is made possible 
by a class of chemicals called surfac
tants. Surfactants act on boundary 
surfaces. One end of each surfactant 
molecule is water-attractive, or hydro
philic, while the opposite side is waterrepulsive or hydrophobic. These ends 
naturally align, and the hydrophobic 
ends attach to oily deposits known as 
sebum on each strand of hair. When 
enough of these have attached, the 
sebum acquires a negative charge and
repels itself from the similarly charged 
hair. Rinse your hair, and down the 
drain it goes!
Lather is actually unnecessary. The 
large amount of lather we see on sham
poo advertisements is just a market
ing ploy to glamorize shampoo. Lather 
is the result of surfactants wastefully 
interacting with air, which actually re
duces the cleaning ability of your sham
poo. Take that, sexy Herbal Essences 
lady!
Many other chemicals exist to fulfill 
secondary purposes, with names that 
would make all but the most diehard 
chemists cringe. Emulsifiers are added 
to boost viscosity. Preservatives are 
added so bacteria dont multiply inside 
the shampoo bottle.
Often some conditioners are added, 
even though most people think of con
ditioner as a separate product. Con
ditioners use positively charged mol
ecules, which attach to the hair, cancel
ing the hairs natural negative charge 
and eliminating static. They dont wash 
away when rinsed, either, leaving a 
protective layer on the cuticle.
Fragrances are frequently added as 
well, even if the shampoo is unscented. 
It turns out that this mass of harsh 
chemicals doesnt smell like wild roses 
on a dewy morning. Fragrance cancels 
out the otherwise objectionable smell.
Never thought shampoo was so com
plicated, did you? Whether your hair 
is straight, curly, wavy, or afrotastic, 
and whether its black, brown, blond, 
or red, shampoo knows no bounds. 
Except for a small minority of computer 
science majors, we all enjoy a freshly 
shampooed head of hair. Just dont 
lather too much.
Local team takes first in high school robotics competition
by Nicole Hayward
Junior Staffwriter
We were a rookie team  we 
had borrowed tools in a Shop 
n Save bag  but the rookie 
team won out, said Michael 
Dischner, the advisor of the 
McKeesport High School team 
that won the FIRST Pittsburgh 
Regional Robotics Competition 
on March 12. While this years 
FIRST competition is a true story 
of an underdogs amazing tri
umph, its happy ending has yet 
to come: The McKeesport team 
may not have enough financial 
support to continue on to the 
national competition.
This year, the FIRST (For In
spiration and Recognition of 
Science and Technology) com
petition took place on the Uni
versity of Pittsburghs campus 
March 10-12. Thirty-two high 
school teams from all over the 
United States and Canada, with 
four from the Pittsburgh area,
gathered at the Petersen Events 
Center. There, they could de
termine which team had, in 
six weeks, built the robot that 
could best play the competition 
games.
The McKeesport team, Team 
1708  Natural Selection, didnt 
have six weeks to make their ro
bot, called Charles. After decid
ing that the competition needed 
more teams, David Richardson, 
head of the Pittsburgh FIRST 
Planning Committee, asked an 
organization The Future Is Mine 
(TFIM) to find another competi
tor. TFIM, Mon Valley Education 
Consortiums initiative, sought 
out the McKeesport team. Only 
two weeks before the event, 
the 11 members of Team 1708 
accepted the challenge.
The kids really wanted to 
build it, said Dischner. In addi
tion to advising the team, Disch
ner teaches Team 1708 students 
in an engineering technology 
class.
Using their learned skills and
engineering innovation, Team 
1708 quickly planned how to 
create a robot that can block 
other robots and pick up large 
tetrahedral objects, tetras, and 
place them on a target plat
form.
The McKeesport team did a 
great job developing their robot 
in only two weeks, said Jes
sica Pedersen of the FIRST Pitts
burgh Planning Committee. Al
though Charles was not as big or 
as technically complicated as the 
other robots, the team was able 
to use it to play defense during 
the Triple Play1 game. Charles 
out-performed 24 robots before 
it was eliminated in the penulti
mate round.
In the final round, however, 
a finalist robot experienced a 
mechanical error. The team was 
given five minutes to fix their 
robots malfunction, but had no 
luck. The FIRST Competition 
called upon Team 1708 to step 
up to the final round.
Team 1708 joined two other
teams to compete against three 
teams in a three-on-three match 
on a 27-foot-by-54-foot field. 
Charles and two other robots 
stood at one end of the field, fac
ing their opponents. When the 
round began, the robots stacked 
tetras and blocked enemy ro
bots. With the best defensive 
skill on the field, Charles made a 
game-winning block. Team 1708 
burst out, cheering.
The members of team 1708 
werent the only ones cheering. 
We couldnt be more proud of 
these kids. They worked hard, 
under great pressure, and they 
won. We hope the Atlanta ex
perience is just as exciting and 
successful for them, said Amy 
LeFevers, the TFIM project di
rector to the Mon Valley Educa
tional Consortium.
Unfortunately, after such hard 
work and accomplishment, Team 
1708 may not make it to the 
Championship competition in 
Atlanta on April 21 and 22. The 
team does not have sufficient
funding to improve Charles, 
travel to Atlanta, and pay the 
$5000 entrance fee. In efforts 
to fundraise, Dischner and his 
students are asking local engi
neering companies for financial 
assistance.
General Motors in Pittsburgh 
has already contributed, and 
a deal with Westinghouse is in 
the works. A Carnegie Mellon 
University spin-off company, re2, 
Inc., is also a key contributor to 
the teams fundraising.
If Team 1708 raises enough 
money, Atlanta will have to 
watch out, because this time 
around the students from McK
eesport High School will have 
time to enhance Charles.
Still in high school, the mem
bers of Team 1708 have already 
proven themselves to be capable 
engineers. Many of them plan to 
attend college for engineering; 
in fact, one senior on the team 
is eagerly awaiting a letter from 
the admissions department of 
Carnegie Mellon.

Tuberculosis drug 
takes on phobias
The tuberculosis drug D-cycloserine has been discovered to 
improve learning and memory, 
which may potentially help people 
overcome psychiatric disorders. 
Although irrational fears have 
been resistant to nearly all drug 
therapy, researchers at Emory 
University found that combining 
the drug with psychotherapeutic 
treatment helped subjects conquer 
the fear of heights more quickly. 
The drug helps patients learn to 
feel comfortable in the presence 
of their greatest fears. Other sci
entists hypothesize that the drug 
might help anorexic patients un
learn their harmful eating habits.

Device will make 
clean water in space
In as little as two years, a de
vice that recycles sweat, urine, 
and the moisture from breathing 
into drinking water may serve as
tronauts aboard the International 
Space Station. In more needy ar
eas, including Iraq and Southeast 
Asia, smaller and simpler versions 
of this technology are anticipated 
to be available by September. 
However, before the technology 
can be installed aboard the space 
shuttle, it must undergo numer
ous tests to ensure that the sys
tem is capable of withstanding the 
stresses of liftoff.

Man wins free ride on 
commercial spaceship
Doug Ramsburgh of Colorado 
will become one of the worlds 
first intergalactic tourists. Rams
burgh was randomly selected from 
135,000 entries in the Boldly Go 
sweepstakes, sponsored by Virgin 
Galactic  the new offshoot of 
the Virgin empire  and Volvo. 
The winner has a reserved seat 
aboard a modified version of 
SpaceShipOne.
Last fall, SpaceShipOne made 
history as the first commercially 
funded spaceship ever launched. 
Virgin Galactic commercial space 
flights are expected to begin in 
two or three years, pending safety 
and regulatory approval, and will 
cost about $200,000. Like any 
prospective astronaut, Ramsburg 
will have to undergo basic train
ing and pass a physical, but this 
process will not be so rigorous as 
to exclude the general public.

Contacts may replace 
diabetics needles
Diabetics may soon be able to 
track their blood sugar levels by 
wearing specially designed con
tact lenses. Diabetes affects the 
bodys ability to produce insulin, 
which results in dangerous spikes 
in blood sugar levels. Currently, 
most diabetics must monitor 
their blood sugar levels by draw
ing blood. But Chris Geddes, the 
associate director of the Center 
for Fluorescence Spectroscopy at 
the University of Maryland, says 
diabetics finger-pricking days are 
numbered.
To make sugar-sensing contact 
lenses, a substance is added that 
glows at varying intensities de
pending upon the presence or ab
sence of glucose (sugar) in the 
body. A handheld device flashes a 
blue light into the eye to measure 
the intensity of the glow and then 
determines the individuals blood 
sugar level. Many people with dia
betes also need glasses or contact 
lenses because of the way diabetes 
affects the blood vessels in the 
retina, so monitoring blood sugar 
levels with contact lenses makes 
sense, says Geddes.

Students anticipating Carnivals 
arrival want to see it publicized
Youre walking along the Cut, and 
as you pass Doherty Hall, you look up 
and smile as you see advertisements for 
Carnival 2005. You anticipate a stress-free 
weekend filled with music, buggy races, 
and Midway masterpieces. Everywhere 
you look, students are relaxed, spending 
a few well-deserved days to take a break 
from the usual university grind.
Its nice to feel the excitement of 
three straight days of University-wide 
celebration, isnt it? But you havent been 
smiling as you walk past Doherty, or any 
other building on campus for that matter, 
because you have not seen any publicity 
for this years Carnival. With festivities 
three weeks away, students have not been 
privy to Carnival information. The Carni
val Committee has just today announced 
this years Carnival theme and musical 
group, witholding the comedian as TBA. 
With Carnival less than three weeks away, 
students should have known sooner. So 
why were students being left in the dark?
It would seem that Carnival and its 
publicity were ready and waiting to go, 
but were being held up due to previously 
unsigned contracts. When most musical 
acts are slated, they typically have 
specific demands that they want met 
before securing their performance at a 
given venue. This year, our musical act 
has allegedly made demands that the 
University was not ready to meet, and 
the contract was not signed until after 
negotiations over the amenities Carnegie
Mellon was willing to provide were settled. 
Contracts got caught up in University beaurocracy, and information was brought 
to a standstill.
While its understandable that the Car
nival Committee may not want to publi
cize a musical act without having them 
contractually bound to perform, we won
der what happened to the usual buzz 
about Carnival. So they cant post signs for 
the musical performance. Where were the 
posters for everything else? Why didnt 
students know who the comedian is, or 
when they would be able to get bracelets 
for the events? Where were the Carnival 
schedules that note when the buggy races 
started, when Midway opened, or when 
the athletic alumni games began? The 
Carnival Committee failed to let us know 
even the most basic information about the 
scheduling of Carnival until just now.
Students on campus look for any 
reprieve from the stress that builds this 
time of year. With finals and graduation 
on the horizon, Carnival is one of the only 
campus activities that engages the whole 
student population. Failing to advertise 
at this point in the semester led the com
munity to make wild assumptions about 
the status of Carnival; without the Uni
versity allowing proper information to be 
released, students have been in the dark.
We may have to wait a few more weeks 
for Carnival to begin, but thank you for fi
nally throwing us a bone. Keep spreading 
joy. Keep advertising for Carnival.
CMU works to keep its global 
community better connected
Despite being 7000 miles apart, the 
Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses are closer 
this week. Seven students from CMUs 
first class of undergraduates at the Qatar 
campus are visiting us here in Pittsburgh, 
traveling around the globe to meet their 
Pennsylvania counterparts. This is the 
first trip students from the Qatar campus 
will have made to Pittsburgh.
During spring break, students, 
administrators, and trustees traveled 
from Pittsburgh to Doha for the inau
gural celebration of the Qatar campus. 
This week, the Qatari students recipro
cate. They will be touring the city  a 
Mount Washington Incline ride, dinner 
in Shadyside, and time at the University 
are all on the itinerary. We know we 
speak on behalf of the campus when we 
say Welcome to Pittsburgh!
While Carnegie Mellon has main
tained a number of satellite branches 
over the years that each offer masters 
degrees, the new Qatar campus is en
tirely different. Receiving a Carnegie 
Mellon undergraduate education, these 
students are in everyway our classmates. 
Their curriculum has been designed by 
Carnegie Mellon professors; their under
graduate experiences are being molded 
by Carnegie Mellon administrators and 
staff members. Furthermore, the num
ber of Pittsburgh-based faculty that have 
moved to Qatar to teach there means 
that many of us have been taught by the 
same faculty.
Less than a year old, the Qatar campus 
is still developing and growing; these 
students are undoubtably hoping to 
learn more about how things work in 
Pittsburgh in order to improve things in 
Qatar. This curiosity runs in both direc
tions, as there are plenty of Pittsburgh
students who would love to learn more 
about what life is like for our Qatari 
classmates.
Trips like these are fantastic, but not 
exactly affordable for most students at 
either campus. Earlier in the year there 
was a videoconference for small group of 
students in Qatar and Pittsburgh. While 
videoconferences might allow for better 
communication in general, they are far 
from an ideal way to share information 
between the students of both campuses.
There are a number of ways to improve 
communication between the campuses. 
Students at both ends should have more 
opportunities to study abroad at the 
other. A standing scholarship to help pay 
transportation costs for any Pittsburgh 
students who want to spend a semester 
abroad in Qatar (or vice versa) would 
be a great step towards this goal. Also, 
we need to make sure that Pittsburgh 
students understand more about the 
Qatar Foundation and the Qatar campus. 
Regrettably, there is currently no exhibit 
or display on campus that explains the 
history and intention of the Qatar cam
pus. More information would lead to a 
better understanding between the two 
campuses.
Perhaps the best way to improve com
munication between the two campuses is 
to let the Qatari students tell their own 
stories. Wed like to offer these seven 
students a chance to write about their 
experiences in a column to be published 
in next weeks Tartan.
More regular communication between 
students will be the best way for the two 
campuses to connect with each other; 
we look forward to hearing more from 
the Qatari students. Until then, we hope 
they enjoy their week in the Burgh.

Reorganize and Streamline:
State should consider creative options in reworking its government
Adam Greenberg
Pennsylvania has as relatively new 
constitution, but its government still 
runs on 1870s principles. New Jersey, 
in a similar situation, is considering 
a constitutional convention to make 
some major changes to its state govern
ment, such as the addition of a lieuten
ant governor. Currently, New Jersey is 
presided over by Acting Governor Rich
ard Codey, who is simultaneously the 
president of the state senate, making 
New Jersey the only state that allows a 
person to work for multiple branches of 
government at the same time. They cite 
their need for a lieutenant governor 
as threefold: as a replacement for the 
governor, an assistant to the governor, 
and an additional statewide office for 
advancement.
Though New Jersey should disallow 
serving in both capacities, their inclu
sion of a lieutenant governor is wholly 
unnecessary. Pennsylvania should take 
a cue from our neighbor across the 
Delaware, however, and examine our 
states overarching structure. Penn
sylvanias current constitution was 
approved in 1968, as the fifth such 
document in the states history, and 
is supposed to provide only the most 
basic forms of governmental structure. 
But while the biggest changes in the 
constitution of 1968 were changes in 
the judiciary of the state, most of the 
changes were limited to minutiae such 
as local government and tax struc
tures.
The 1968 constitution kept the 
executive structure of the state intact. 
Pennsylvania elects five statewide 
officers: governor and lieutenant 
governor (slated), attorney general, 
auditor general, and treasurer.
There is room for creativity in 
governmental structure. Eight states
have no lieutenant governor position. 
Five have legislators as their lieuten
ant; three, an elected secretary of state. 
One of these is New Hampshire, a state 
which has the second largest legislature 
in the United States: second only to the 
U.S. Congress, with 400 members in 
their house of representatives alone, 
where theyre all volunteers. New 
Hampshire pays only $40,000 per an
num to all of them combined. Nebraska 
dropped the lower house from their 
government 70 years ago after deter
mining that overlapping jurisdictions 
only complicated the legislative pro
cess.
Pennsylvanias inclusion of the lieu
tenant governor is a curious one: the 
position is basically used as an assistant 
to the governor. Its proven in other 
states: A chain of command can exist 
in the absence of a lieutenant gover
nor. The positions use as a statewide 
catapult to recognition goes mostly un
noticed. Only one lieutenant governor 
in the history of the commonwealth 
has been elected governor: Raymond 
Shafer, one of the main architects of 
the current state government. Pennsyl
vania assigns only ceremonial duties to 
the position.
The lieutenant governor and 
governor do not have to see eye to eye, 
or even like each other; the two are 
slated by the voters without eithers 
consent. Among the states principals 
is our secretary of the commonwealth, 
a primarily administrative position 
currently appointed by the governor. 
There is no practical reason that an 
elected secretary of the commonwealth 
could not succeed the governor.
On the other side of the issue is 
the Pennsylvania legislature, a body 
of 253 citizens of the commonwealth. 
Its a caricature of a legislative body, 
though: members who go golfing but 
still get to vote, members who use 
state funds to lease cars, members who 
spend numerous session days at home. 
Merely from a statistical standpoint,
more representatives are better, and 
when a state can ensure a quality body 
as New Hampshire can in its General 
Court, smaller constituencies are ben
efit citizens.
An example of how Pennsylvanias 
state senators feel they can best serve 
is Vince Fumo (D-Philadelphia), who 
clearly feels that Pennsylanians owe 
him a Cadillac and a yacht. At the 
same time, the House of Representa
tives passed internal rules that let them 
file votes without attending the days 
proceedings, so-called ghost voting, 
meaning they could install  or block
 laws without ever reviewing the 
final version. When politicians are as 
belligerent or corrupt as Pennsylvanias 
are, a smaller legislature gets more ac
complished.
Pennsylvania has one of the larg
est full-time state legislatures, but it 
gets voters no better representation 
in the state capitol. According to Ne
braskas argument in creating a uni
cameral legislature, two bodies that 
are elected the same way with similar 
duties and restrictions arent necessary. 
Pennsylvanias House of Representa
tives does nothing the Senate cant do 
by itself.
If Pennsylvanias government cared 
enough even to show up every day, 
we as citizens might expect efficiency 
and cooperation that would serve our 
best interests; at present the best we 
can hope for is an occasional com
promise across party lines. Creative 
solutions exist to engage representa
tives through restructuring. The com
monwealth should consider its own 
constitutional convention and elimi
nate from the document those rules 
which could better serve us as regular 
statutes.
Adam Greenberg (agreenbe@.) is a con
tributing editor to The Tartan. He would 
like to note the rarity of his envying 
the citizens of New Jersey as expressed 
above.
Cuban embargo puts strain on family ties
Alexander Meseguer
I lost my most direct link to Cuba 
nearly a month ago when my grand
father died. We were not close  I 
had only met him once. But some
thing bothered me about the event 
nevertheless.
There was no logical reason I could 
put my finger on for feeling such strong 
emotion, for feeling my motivation for 
doing homework slip away and leav
ing me little choice but to delve into 
my photo album and grieve. Over the 
next three weeks, my grief had turned 
to anger.
You see, my father never went to 
Cuba to bury his father. His adopted 
country said no, you cannot go to Cuba 
to lay your father to rest; it would 
support Castro.
A handful of months before the 
election in 2004, Bushs administration 
tightened travel restrictions to 
Cuba, constricting the family circle 
appropriate to visit and reducing 
the number of times Cuban-Americans 
could visit the island from once a 
year to once every three years. The 
conservative-leaning hard-line Cubans 
of Florida were important to Bush. 
The votes he gained from this action 
might have brought him closer to these 
Cubans, but they have alienated many 
others.
Ive been to the point in the U.S. clos
est to Cuba, which is just 90 miles from 
our soil at that point. Its a point marked
with a concrete monolith weighing 
thousands of pounds. When I learned 
of the restrictions, it was almost as 
if the same weight was being placed 
on my shoulders by the federal gov
ernment. There was one other change 
in the restrictions, too: no emergency 
visits.
It didnt matter if a cousin, sister, 
nephew or uncle was dying, or if they 
needed medication only you could get 
to them. It didnt matter if they had just 
died. Uncle Sam was saying no, that 
Fidel Castro, Cubas president and 
one of the most successful dictators in 
the history of the world, was an evil 
man and had to be punished. From the 
stories passed down through the last 
two generations of my family, I believe 
this to be true.
My dad could have done what an 
estimated 25,000 to 100,000 Cubans 
a year do and fly there through a third 
country, violating a poorly-enforced 
law to see his family, but by the time he 
would have arrived, the funeral would 
have been over. I dont know why he 
didnt go anyway.
The intent of the restrictions is to 
deny hard currency to Castros govern
ment, but it is obvious that Bushs rules 
arent working. Legally, you can only 
send $100 per month to family mem
bers in Cuba, but if what other Cubans 
I know send there is any indication, the 
amounts are much more. According 
to Wikipedia, Cubans receive nearly 
$850 million each year from CubanAmericans.
These restrictions only create
anguish for families who are denied 
the fundamental right to travel and see 
their family members. The economic 
and travel embargo against Cuba does 
not work. For 46 years, Castro has ruled 
the island, secure in his power and rev
eling in the success of his revolution.
Has everything the embargo has 
done been evil? No, but the United 
States cannot expect that a few more 
years of the same strategy will do what 
the last four decades have failed to do. 
It is time for our government to stop 
bullying the country and assault it with 
the tools of capitalism, cultural influ
ence, and compassion.
One day, after Castro dies, I in
tend to buy land in Cuba and build a 
house there with a boat in Miami for a 
leisurely cruise to my summer getaway. 
I suspect many other U.S.-born CubanAmericans will rediscover their roots 
and bring their families and dollars to 
the island in the years to come, regard
less of whether Uncle Sam gives them 
permission.

The Tartan has given space for each candidate running for Student Body President this year to respond to the following 
questions: What are the three most important changes that you have seen occur at Carnegie Mellon in your time here as 
students? What was the role of the Student Body President at the time and what would you have done differently had you 
been the Student Body President then?
STUDENBD OBNNBUYP
In the past two years, although 
there havent been any specific 
events which garnered changes 
on campus, there has been an 
overarching change in the feel
ings which have moved through 
campus as a whole. Most impor
tantly, the Natrat, the effect of 
diversity on campus, and the ef
fects of political speakers on cam
pus have forced us to re-evaluate 
the university setting as a whole, 
inspiring us to push forward. 
The roles of the Student Body 
President during these times are 
extremely important, and need 
to be looked at critically in order 
to see the effects they had and 
could have had on campus.
Last year, the publication of 
the Natrat brought about much 
controversy and debate on cam
pus and was the start of what 
became a series of larger issues. 
While it was a difficult time for 
The Tartan and the campus as 
a whole, the change it brought 
about at the time was extremely 
important for the morale of cam
pus. Carnegie Mellon is widely 
known as an extremely apathetic 
university, having an unspoken 
sense of bitterness and aggra
vation. The Natrats publication, 
although distressing, stirred uni
versity thinking and brought stu
dents feelings to the forefront, 
forcing discussion where it had 
been avoided and ignored in the 
past.
Student government at the 
time, though, did not take a pro
active step in using the issue to 
the advantage of the university. 
The open forum held a few days 
after the issue arose was hosted 
by The Tartan and had requested 
that Dan Gilman and Gilbert 
Dussek, Student Body President 
and Vice-President, moderate. 
Other than this, Gilman seemed 
to skirt around the issue at hand, 
failing to take proactive steps in 
using the open controversy to ad
dress other prevalent issues. As
Student Body President, Gilman, 
in my opinion, should have fol
lowed up on the issues, holding 
subsequent forums and address
ing topics related to the contro
versy, as well as issues relating 
to organizational and diversity 
issues on campus.
Recently, political speakers 
have been a major concern on 
campus, as well. From Shabazz 
to Finkelstein, students have 
been forced to take notice of 
policies such as the Universitys 
controversial speakers clause, 
while taking into account the 
gravity of the effect that they 
and their organizations have 
on other groups and the cam
pus as a whole. This year, the 
issues have been stepped around 
by the Student Body President, 
and I feel that they need to be 
directly addressed. Leaders of 
groups on campus represent the 
groups themselves. The Student 
Body President needs to work 
with University administration 
and develop programs to bring 
together university leadership. 
By having the leaders of cam
pus organizations work together 
in groups, it will ideally foster 
an environment of trust and un
derstanding among these groups 
and the University as a whole.
The political divide on cam
pus was brought to the fore
front when political figures like 
Michael Moore and John Kerry 
spoke to the community. Never 
before had the political split 
been so apparent and vitriolic. 
I believe that it is the job of the 
Student Body President to en
courage different organizations 
to try and invite speakers from 
as many parties as possible, in 
order to maintain balanced po
litical representation on campus.
I feel that in the past, too many 
Student Body Presidents have 
taken a very non-active or re
actionary stance. I feel that it is 
time for most presidents to act in 
a way which they feel best suits 
the University. In this case, I find
it necessary to take more action 
towards progressing forward 
and acting for the benefit of the 
University as a whole.
RIY AULTUY
The web portal (my.cmu.edu) 
was an amazing addition to the 
technology that the University 
already had, and provided the 
potential to be able to find 
everything at one web site. The 
Student Body Presidents of the 
previous two years were instru
mental in the planning and the 
implementation of the portal. 
Dan Gilman was mainly respon
sible for the advertisement of the 
site after its initial launch with 
posters aind articles in readme. 
Once the portal was finished, I 
would have suggested that there 
was ample advertising of the site.
I also would have suggested more 
capabilities for the site, such as 
an athletics calendar, a link to an 
online version of The Word, and 
links to what happens in the sur
rounding community.
During the recent academic 
year, the Greek community has 
faced many changes, which have 
gready affected a large portion 
of this campus. Although the ad
ministration maintains its poli
cies are mainly unchanged, and 
the community insists its habits 
are the same as ever, the fact is 
that Greek organizations have 
had a hard time adapting to their 
current relationship with the ad
ministration. Fraternities have 
been affected the most, having 
been forced to change many of 
the practices which they have 
followed in the past, specifically 
affecting the social aspects Greek 
life provides to the commu
nity. During the first semester, 
the Greek organizations were 
in shock as numerous punish
ments were levied and even a 
chapters charter was removed 
and subsequently lost its house. 
The fraternities and sororities 
could have used some type of

breaking the communication bar
riers. The first time the FOIP was 
brought before Senate during 
the 2002-2003 academic year, it 
was vetoed by the Student Body 
President. Had I been in office, I 
would not have vetoed the FOIP, 
as I believe all students have the 
right to know how their student 
activities fee is being used. This 
example is a clear indication of 
the communication barrier that 
exists on this campus  there 
needs to be a functional online 
location where all information 
pertinent to students is available 
and user-friendly. The average 
student does not know that the 
FOIP exists, and it is the respon
sibility of student government 
to make certain that students 
are aware of these policies, and 
more importantly, their rights.
Of all of the changes that have 
occurred on campus, the most 
important, but least recognized, 
change has been the attempt of 
the student government to open 
its doors to the general student 
body. Past presidents have tried 
to utilize features such as office 
hours and concerns@andrew. 
cmu.edu, but there is still a lack 
of communication that exists. 
The student body should have 
more input regarding the con
cerns and goals of our commu
nity; we need to communicate in 
order to work towards fixing the 
stagnant problems which have 
too long existed.
The confounding factors slow
ing progress are the lack of com
munication and debate on and 
around campus. Candidates run 
on reform all the time, yet they 
are often part of the culture that 
made change necessary in the 
first place. To spur involvement 
through the creation of a culture 
that produces well-debated re
sults is a top priority for Ben and 
me. The issues, as well as a need 
for transformation, should drive 
voter turnout. If you really want 
to see change, become involved

guidance in trying to understand 
and adapt to the way that the 
guidelines would be interpreted 
and enforced. Sadly, the current 
Student Body President failed to 
assist any organizations in this 
series of events. If I had been 
Student Body President, I would 
have begun by having a forum 
for the presidents of the Greek 
organizations with the relevant 
members of the administration 
to understand the reasoning for 
the recent actions. I also would 
have worked closely with the ad
ministration to relay information 
to the Greek organizations, so 
the decisions they had to make 
could have been proactive in
stead of reactive.
eUarnN bTIPP
Since the fall of 2002, many 
important changes have oc
curred on campus. Some of these 
changes were a direct result of 
the Student Body President at 
that time, while others took place 
independently of the executive 
branch. The most beneficial de
velopments have been those that 
worked towards strengthening 
students rights and securing stu
dent safety.
Through six semesters at 
Carnegie Mellon, I have wit
nessed the installation of extra 
lighting and the blue light secu
rity phones as well as the imple
mentation of the escort/shuttle 
service. These security advance
ments have helped to improve 
the safety of all Carnegie Mellon 
community members, especially 
during evening hours. The stu
dent government should make 
student safety a priority, as it is 
important for the student body 
to feel secure anywhere on cam
pus 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week.
On March 28, 2004, the 
Freedom of Information Policy 
(FOIP) was passed by the 
Undergraduate Student Senate 
and took the first step towards

Pirates filled with young prospects
Summer Internshio
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
Crew  Gary Feigenbaum Feigenbaum, a senior rower, was the 
only member of the team to be selected to the 2005 United States 
Maccabiah Rowing Team. This team will compete in the 17th annual 
World Maccabiah Games this July in Israel. He was a member of the 
heavyweight mens team that placed third in the Murphy Cup. He helped 
lead the Tartans to their best performance ever in the regatta.
Mens Tennis  Carl Yang Yang, a junior, breezed through his match 
against Gouchers Devin Viscaino in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1. His victory 
was one of only two in Tartan singles competition this weekend. He also 
played on the number two doubles team that lost a tough 8-6 decision.
Roller Hockey Tier II  Matt Palastro Graduate Student Palastro, a fifth 
-year defenseman, continued to lead by example, scoring two goals and 
continuing his strong play at the blueline. He led the team to a playoff 
victory over fifth-seeded Robert Morris
After the Steelers got manhan
dled by the Patriots and the Pitt 
mens basketball team got run 
out of the NCAA Tournament 
(by Pacific, no less!), the sports 
scene in Pittsburgh has practical
ly been dead. However, its seeds 
lie dormant as a glimmer of hope 
at PNC Park. The Pittsburgh 
Pirates, with a retooled roster of 
young guns, look like they have 
a chance to be competitive for 
the first time in years. The team 
may be able to pull itself out of 
the basement of the competitive 
NL Central. Heres a position-byposition look at the new guys 
and old veterans that will call 
PNC home this year.
Catcher Benito Santiago
 Despite his age (hes 39), 
Santiago has been a surprisingly 
reliable backstop the past few 
years, hitting over .270 while 
adding valuable leadership for 
young teams like Kansas City. 
Hell be called on to fill a simi
lar role here, with longtime fan 
favorite Jason Kendall now play
ing for Oakland. While not spec
tacular, Santiago will fill the gap 
in the lineup for a year and get 
the job done. Then hell retire so 
he can spend more time with his 
grandkids.
First Base Craig Wilson  Who 
doesnt like Craig Wilson? The 
Thor lookalike has finally found 
a permanent position at first 
base for the Bucs, where his 
weak defense can be hidden for 
the most part. Wilson can mash, 
so expect him to put up over
30 home runs this season, but the 
biggest concern here is avoiding 
a second-half slump. Wilson hit 
just .235 after the All-Star Break 
in 2004.
Second Base Freddy Sanchez
 This position could also go 
to either Bobby Hill or Jose
The Pirates will be counting on big plays defensively and offensively from Craig Wilson.
Castillo, but right now it seems 
like Sanchez will be there on 
Opening Day. Sanchez was one 
of the Red Sox top prospects 
when he came to Pittsburgh in 
a trade, but hasnt played much 
because of injuries. Hell have 
the chance to play if hes healthy, 
but he wont do anything spec
tacular offensively. He plays 
solid defense, though, and can 
help this team.
Shortstop Jack Wilson  Was 
Wilson a one-year wonder? He 
collected over 200 hits last sea
son, batted .308, and appeared 
in 157 of the teams 162 games. 
However, his career average is 
still a paltry .265, and most crit
ics doubt that he can come up 
with a repeat performance. If he 
can, hell score lots of runs bat
ting in the second position for 
the team.
Third Base Ty Wigginton  
Wigginton, a moose of a third 
baseman, came to the Pirates in 
the Kris Benson trade, and seem
ingly wasnt happy playing on the 
Three Rivers. After smacking 12 
homers and hitting .285 in New 
York, he batted only .220 with 
the Pirates. The team hasnt had
a reliable corner man since they 
shipped away Aramis Ramirez, 
and they will need Wigginton to 
produce if they want to get any
thing started offensively. He'll 
be key in driving home Jason 
Bay and Wilson to create runs.
Left Field Jason Bay  Bay 
has the most potential of any 
player on this young team. He 
was named the National League 
Rookie of the Year after hitting
26 home runs and driving in 
82 runs in just 120 games. If he 
can build on his performance, 
hell quickly become the young 
leader of this team. However, 
his production relies heavily on 
the guys at the top of the lineup, 
who bat first, second and third. If 
those guys cant get on base, then 
Bays bat is as good as useless.
Center Field Tike Redman
 Redman seems to be living 
up to his potential after coming 
on strong to close out the 2004 
season. Hes a speedy guy who 
can chase down long fly balls 
and steal bases when its need
ed. With the addition of Matt 
Lawton, the pressure of being the 
leadoff hitter will be taken off his 
shoulders. Though he wont hit
too many home runs, Redmans 
ability to get on base from a deep 
position in the batting order will 
be valuable to this team.
Right Field Matt Lawton  
Lawton will be called upon to 
replace Jason Kendalls work as 
leadoff hitter. Lawton was an AllStar last year, but his numbers 
declined in the second half of the 
season. He hits for more power 
than Kendall and can steal bases 
at a similar rate, but the biggest 
question mark is his batting aver
age. Before last year, he only hit 
.236 and .249, respectively.
Utility Rob Mackowiak  
Mackowiak did everything for 
this team last year, playing every 
outfield position, third base and 
first base. Hes a baseball player 
in the Tedy Bruschi mold  he 
may not be the most talented, 
but he plays his heart out every 
night and usually makes some 
spectacular plays. He can fill 
in all over the field and brings 
power and decent speed to the 
lineup. However, behind him, 
there isnt too much depth on 
this team.
Next week: The pitchers.

Crew teams open season at Murphy Cup
by Erin Goldberger
Staffwriter
Strong performances high
lighted the first regatta of the 
2005 season for the Carnegie 
Mellon crew team. The 23rd 
Annual Murphy Cup Regatta was 
held Saturday in Philadelphia, PA 
and hosted by Temple University. 
Both Carnegie Mellons mens 
and womens crew teams were in 
attendance. This was both of the 
teams first races of the spring 
season. The team has been back 
on the water since after spring 
break and went to Aiken, South 
Carolina for training during the 
break. All of the races were 2000 
meters long, and in rowing terms, 
considered sprints.
In the womens varsity light
weight four person division, 
senior Emily Mackay, junior 
Sarah Crosskey, sophomore 
Stefanie Sydlik and graduate 
student Audria Stubna took first 
place in front of University of 
Pittsburgh and Lehigh University 
with a time of 7:35.93. They fin
ished over four seconds ahead of 
a tired Pitt team.
In the womens varsity heavy
weight four person division the 
women, coxswain sophomore 
Abby Sanders and rowers senior 
Franny Ritchie, junior Darbi 
Roberts, sophomore Maura 
Ferguson, and senior Steph Busi 
came in third behind a strong 
Villanova team that finished 
lengths ahead of the field. Navy 
and Carnegie Mellon battled it 
out for second, but Navy pulled 
through to take silver by only 
seven-tenths of a second. The

Mens track team 
looks to build on 
strong indoor 
campaign
by Andrea Garvue
Staffwriter
After a successful end to the 
indoor track season, the mens 
track team is ready to take on 
their outdoor season, finishing 
a great first week of training. 
Though the team decided to skip 
the Clarion Early Bird meet, they 
should still be primed to compete 
at home next week to open their 
season.
There were many highlights 
from the indoor conference meet 
at the Armory Stadium in New 
York, including six Carnegie 
Mellon record breaking perfor
mances. The 4 x 400 meter relay 
team (time of 3:19), the Distance 
Medley Relay team (10:11), 
and sophomore sprinter Russel 
Verbofsky (22.19 in the 200-meter 
dash) all set University Athletic 
Association records.
Tom Matta was named UAA 
indoor track athlete of the year 
after winning both the weight 
throw and the shot put. Finally, 
the mens coaching staff, headed 
by Dario Donatelli, was named 
UAA coaching staff of the year. 
This impressive conclusion to the 
indoor season starts the athletes 
with a strong base for their out
door season.
The team will face a number of 
familiar teams this spring. There 
are a total of six scheduled races
for this years outdoor season, 
two of which will be held at 
Carnegie Mellons Gesling 
Stadium.
The track team will be in 
action on campus during 
the Western Pennsylvania 
Championship on Saturday 
and the Carnegie Mellon 
Invitational on April 13. This 
differs from the indoor season, 
where the team was forced to 
travel for each meet since the 
campus has no indoor track.
In the upcoming season, UAA 
champions Matta, Verbofsky, 
Nik Bonaddio, and Matt Dalka 
will all be seeking to defend 
their tides. In the early season 
meets, they will take on local 
rivals like Grove City, Allegheny, 
Robert Morris, Washington and 
Jefferson, and Waynesburg. 
Though the teams ultimate goal 
is the NCAA Championships, 
the whole season will lead up to 
the UAA championships, where 
the men look to improve on 
their second place finish from 
the indoor season.
This years conference 
championships will be held 
at Washington University in 
St. Louis on the weekend ^ 
April 23. With the help of hard 
training and good weather, 
the mens team hopes to use 
its streak of school and UAA 
records to set the tone for the 
rest of the track season.
The crew teams opened their 2005 season last Saturday at the Murphy Cup. Here, women's varsity eights row in a qualifying heat.
time of 7:35.65. It was an encour
aging performance from some of 
the women's team veterans.
We have worked hard over the 
winter months indoors and now 
we are getting to show what we 
can do on the water, said wom
ens team captain Sarah Wilson. 
CMU Crew has put together 
amazingly strong top boats in 
each of the four divisions: heavy
weight men, lightweight men, 
open women, and lightweight 
women. Its a great time for the 
team, and I am excited to see 
what is to come for the rest of 
the semester. Our novice team 
started out small this year, but
they have really pulled together 
to make three competitive boats 
as well.
In the mens races, the Carnegie 
Mellon mens varsity heavyweight 
four person A team, which con
sisted of senior coxswain Jared 
Deible and rowers senior Gary 
Feigenbaum, first-year Greg 
Collins, senior Justin Samuels, 
and sophomore Adam Suhy came 
in third place behind Dowling 
University and Army with a time 
of 6:45.71. They defeated notable 
NCAA Division I schools such as 
Temple, and Lehigh in the com
petitive race and set the stage for 
an impressive season to come.
In the four person novice men's 
division the Tartan men came 
in fourth behind University of 
Pittsburgh, Temple University, 
and Lehigh University with a 
time of 7:19.21 finishing nearly 
30 seconds behind the victorious 
Pitt squad. In a special Division II 
and III exclusive race, the wom
ens varsity eight squad placed 
fourth.
Team improvements were ap
parent across the board. In 2004, 
the womens lightweight four per
son team got third place with a 
time of 7:50.67, behind Villanova 
and Temple. This years results 
show an improved team with
the much faster time of 7:35.93. 
However, the Tartans decided not 
to compete in many events in 
which the team previously ex
celled. Last year at the Murphy 
Cup, the mens pair team, a twoperson boat, took first place but 
did not participate in the event 
this year, failing to defend their 
title. The mens lightweight eight 
person team also placed second 
last year behind St. Joes with a 
time of 6:32.44, but had no rep
resentation in 2005.
Both the mens and womens 
teams seemed extremely pleased 
with the first meet of the season. 
Mens captain Collins said, The

Mens tennis stumbles against Goucher
were victorious, breezing to an
8-3 victory.
Down a point, the Tartans 
struggled to get back on their 
game in the singles part of the 
competition. Number one singles 
player Boris Sofman set the tone 
for the day in losing a 1-6, 4-6 
decision to Gouchers Brandon 
Harris. At second singles, the 
match of the day looked like it 
would be between Clearfield and 
42nd-ranked Andrew Danos of 
Goucher. Though Danos pulled 
ahead with a 6-3 first set vic
tory, Clearfield pulled the second 
set to 5-5 to ensure extra sets. 
However, at that point he had to 
withdraw from the match with an 
undisclosed injury. Though dis
appointing, this result had little 
to do with the final outcome. The 
team eventually lost four of the 
six singles points to finish up the 
Goucher victory. Winning for the 
Tartans in singles play were Carl 
Yang and Jordan Koslosky.
Later that day, the Tartans were 
scheduled to face 18th-ranked 
Washington College of Maryland. 
However, the match was canceled 
due to inclement weather, giving 
the team some much needed time

Kaleidoscope display in CFA
Intimate exhibit at the Zebra Lounge, open until Tuesday
Those who are not frequenters of the College of 
Fine Arts might not be acquainted with the artsy 
little coffee shop, the Zebra Lounge, which is just 
off to the left after you enter through the front 
doors. Last Tuesday, however, the zebra-striped 
furniture was put to shame by the art pieces 
scattered along the walls of the caf.
The exhibit, titled Kaleidoscope, has been an 
annual display of student artwork since 2000. 
The exhibit hosts artwork from students in the 
BHA and BSA programs, which combine a major 
in CFA with one in either the humanities or 
sciences. The small collection of artistic works is 
on display until Tuesday. However, the exhibit is 
easily enjoyed in the time it takes to sip a cup of 
coffee in the hour break between your statistics 
lab and Intro to Japanese Lit.
Once you pass the counter, you enter the seating 
area at the Zebra Lounge: a fairly open, whitewalled space. For the next few days, however, the 
walls will be covered by photographs, paintings, 
and even a wax mask sculpture. The pieces do 
not have a linked theme, but rather run the 
gamut of ideas in art; the exhibits photographs 
contrast with its surreal drawings.
Just beside the one and only zebra lounge chair 
in the caf is a quilt created by Laura Warne, 
a senior BHA student. Tided Love Quilt, the 
piece is more than that name might suggest. 
Sewn onto a background of heart patches are 
painted images of a monkey, a child, an old 
man, and shapes of several organic molecules. 
The piece seems to suggest evolution more than 
love, and the images stick out far more than 
, their background. The contrast of a comforting 
quilt with the strands of DNA and other images 
is perhaps the most interesting facet of this piece 
of work.
Warne has another, very different piece on 
display: a photograph of someonepresumably 
the artist herselfFacing the Wall. The 
photograph depicts a shadow of a person standing 
against a beaten beige wall. Its composition is 
impressive, especially given the fact that there 
is no visible shadow of the photographer or any 
clue as to whether the figure in the picture is 
taking the photo.
Wendy Edwards, a junior BHA student, created 
another clever piece called Binding. Tiny plastic 
figures are bound by string, twine, ribbon, and
wire to square backgrounds. All are colorful, and 
a few have smaller square bits of paper printed 
with a picture cut into squares or printed with 
typography. Among the random plastic figurines 
of green aliens and other lesser-known icons is 
the beloved childhood favorite: Clifford the Big 
Red Dog. Since he is recognizable, he stands out 
from the rest.
It may be time for a refill on your coffee by this 
point, depending on how long you have spent 
admiring the novelty of a captive Clifford. Just 
beside Edwards piece are more photos, this 
time from Italy. Erin Weber, a BHA senior, took 
photographs of various cities in Italy, including 
Florence and Venice. The display is actually a 
miniature look at Webers Italian experiences 
and features four photos. The best of these is one 
of a small boy who peers between the decorative 
openings in a window. This photo, Peeking Out 
Over Florence, has shadows framing the young 
boy and an interesting contrast of some minor 
graffiti on the windows intricate design.'
Next in the tour of the Zebra Lounge youll 
encounter the only exhibit that cant hang on the 
walls. A mixed media display by Julie Ludwick, a 
senior BHA student, uses interestingly patterned 
pieces of paper and felt to create tiny books 
in the piece, titled W.O.M.E.N. There are two 
identically tiny books for each letter in the word. 
Each letter is very unique, as well: The 0 books 
have white textured covers, while the M books 
are more simple, with neutral green and yellow 
striped covers. The books arent exactly arranged 
in such a way where you can read the word 
women by looking at them. But you do want to 
keep looking.
There are quite a few exhibits packed into a small 
space, a few too many to speak in depth about 
each besides, it would ruin the appeal of 
going if they were all described. The mixture of 
media and the great contrast between the pieces 
gives the experience of an art gallery in the 
span of 20 minutes. Whether you want to take a 
small beverage break or youre really interested 
in student art, the exhibit gives a lot despite its 
modest size. At the Zebra Lounge you can enjoy 
a small bite of food and, for a short time, enjoy 
the scenery of student artwork that brings the 
barren white walls of the Lounge to life.

subUrbia: All the worlds a parking lot
Student directed play has great casting, cliched writing
Although students and locals flock to the School of 
Dramas main stage productions every year, they often 
ignore the Schools smaller student-produced plays and 
musicals. Unfortunately, they dont realize what theyre 
missing. While these productions dont always have the 
gloss or the budget that comes with the Philip Chosky 
Theater, the smaller plays are nonetheless well executed 
and entertaining, and are a way to see drama students, 
especially underclassmen, in action.
Take subUrbia, the latest show to go up in the Helen 
Wayne Rauh Studio Theater. Directed by drama student 
Alyson Blume for her senior thesis, this show was acted, 
designed, and produced almost entirely by juniors in the 
drama department. Producing such a show is no small 
feat, and it appeared that all the hard work had paid off 
on opening night.
subUrbia, written by award-winning playwright and actor 
Eric Bogosian, focuses on the trials of Jeff, a college-aged 
borderline burn-out who cant seem to find anything 
better to do than hang out with his friends in front of a 
7-Eleven. His cohorts include Tim, who flirts with a neoNazi lifestyle and alcoholism; Buff, an aspiring video 
artist with a penchant for smoking weed; and Bee 
Bee, a timid girl rehabilitating from alcohol and drug 
addiction. Throughout the course of the night, Jeff has to 
contend with his girlfriend Sooze, who wants to run off 
to New York to become a performance artist. (Her prized 
piece is titled Burger Manifesto: Part I  The Dialectical 
Exposition of Testosterone, and features a childs doll 
and a dildo, among other props.) He also has to cope with 
his jealousy of Pony, the groups former friend who has 
hit it big in the music business. Drinking, moshing, and 
general mayhem ensue.
Sadly, the plays biggest weakness iswell, the play. The 
material is just too cliched to be very effective anymore
 there have been far too many films and plays made 
about aimless, bored, substance-abusing teenagers in 
recent years. Furthermore, the plot line involving Pony 
is too trite to be believed. What self-respecting rock star 
would be willing to drag his publicist and his limousine 
to go hang out in front of a convenience store with old 
pals?
The good news is that the actors and directors were 
able to recognize the plays weaknesses and interpret 
them in fairly refreshing ways. Rather than attempt 
to contemporize the undoubtedly dated writing, the 
designers chose to take the early-90s feel and run with it
 thus, flannel shirts with the sleeves cut off and rap circa 
1992 abound. Set designer Hallie Stern chose to have the 
characters inhabit a colorful, slighdy psychedelic world
of graffiti and fluorescent signs, while lighting designer 
Andrew Moore enhanced feelings of either romance or 
the nausea of a hangover.
The actors themselves did very well with what they were 
given. Awkward lines were slyly played off with humor 
or given genuine pathos, and all the performances had 
an admirable amount of energy. Jeff, played by junior 
John Carpenter, came off as a sensitive, confused, slightly 
neurotic, but well-meaning kid. Especially fun to watch 
was his scene of drunken, almost ecstatic rambling to a 
shy Bee Bee. David Winters as Buff provided strong comic 
relief as a very believable stoner, and Gregory Coughlin as 
Tim alternated between being sympathetic and seriously 
scary. Its hard to identify with an alcoholic racist, but 
Coughlin managed to make Tim likeable to the audience. 
It is sincerely crushing when the viewer realizes Tim has 
descended too far to be the hero anymore.
The women, unfortunately, didnt fare quite as well, but 
this didnt seem to be the actresses fault as much as the 
writers. None of the female characters progressed beyond 
one dimension. Despite junior Khaliah Adams vitality, 
Sooze came off as more of a nag than a real girlfriend,
and Bee Bee, played by Alexis Wolfe, was sad but didnt 
get to say enough. The most interesting woman was 
Ponys publicist Erica, played by junior Susan Goodwillie. 
Senior Michael Dunay played Pony and did a fine job of 
portraying a preening star half-heartedly attempting to 
connect with his roots by seeing his old friends.
Throughout the play, the characters sparred with the 
stores owners, a Middle-Eastern brother and sister. 
Eventually, this seemingly routine conflict developed 
into something far more violent than expected. Indeed, 
the play ended on an unusually jarring note for its genre. 
If there was one thing original about subUrbia, it was its 
conspicuous lack of a happy ending.
However, the ending did not make the play any 
less enjoyable. The actors and designers should be 
congratulated for creating a professional production that 
showcased many students fine talents. None of these kids 
are going to be wasting time in front of a convenience 
store anytime soon.

Amorphis devastates the South Side
From across the pond, Euro-metal band brings chaos to Pittsburghs Rex Theatre
The South Side became a temporary haven for Euro-metal 
heads last week as Amorphis descended upon the Rex 
Theatre on Carson Street. In recent months, Pittsburgh 
has suffered from a loss of premier locations to hold 
shows, as well as a lack of premier shows. So, kudos to 
the Rex for bringing the boys from Finland to town and 
reviving the Pittsburgh heavy metal scene.
If you havent heard of the band Amorphis  and, sadly, 
chances are that you havent  you should know that 
they mix the best of Sabbathy doom metal with the goth 
of Type 0 Negative and the prog rock of Pink Floyd. 
Amorphis use of keyboards gives their music a tone 
that comes across as a dark, brooding winter, devoid of 
happiness or warmth. (Sounds fun, dont it?)
Coupled with guitars that add a neo-folk feel, Amorphis
brings forth a musical style that sets them apart from 
their peers. While contemporaries such as In Flames and 
Soilwork thrash between melody and anger, Amorphis is 
content to set the mood and let the song tell the story.
After openers Beyond the Embrace and the astoundingly 
good Into Eternity, I settled in with a Coke in hand to 
watch the band of the night. The smell of dry ice filled 
the theatre, and lights shone from out of nowhere as 
Amorphis took the stage. With vigor and class, guitarists 
Esa Holopainen and Tomi Koivusaari launched into 
clean, precise metal riffing. Pasi Koskinen, vocals, tossed 
and turned on stage with his dreads whipping in the air 
around him. It was all heavy but moody, nonetheless. 
Amorphis is such a powerful live act, and it is certainly 
rare to find a metal band that underwhelms the audience 
with aggression, but still overwhelms with emotion.
With a set list that reached deep into the past for songs 
like Castaway and the encore, Black Winter Day, the 
die-hard fans left satiated. Newer songs, such as the title 
track from last years Far From the Sun, worked well with 
the crowd, too.
If you havent been to the Rex before, it is indeed an 
unusual place to watch a metal band. With permanent 
seats in the middle of the venue, moshing is, shall we say, 
limited. Given the lack of live venues in this city, though, 
Id venture the guess that metal-heads will gladly take the 
chairs.
Til next week,

Queens of the big screen
QOTSA return with an epic new batch of robot rock
During the recording of Queens of the Stone Ages fourth 
full-length album, Lullabies to Paralyze, a good deal was 
written about the groups ever-shifting lineup. Gone from 
the roster are hired guns Dave Grohl and Dean Ween, 
who were responsible for their 2002 breakthrough Songs 
for the Deaf. Also missing in action is bassist/cofounder 
Nick Oliveri. In fact, only frontman Josh Homme re
mains, with occasional vocals from former Screaming 
Trees leader Mark Lanegan.
For all intents and purposes, Homme is Queens of the 
Stone Age, and the playing is just as tight with his new 
backing group in place. With their latest effort, the 
Queens have crafted a superb album of dramatic metal 
that expands on the bands already ambitious scope. On 
2000s album Rated R, Homme and company took the 
stoner rock blueprint they had pioneered as members 
of early 90s desert metal heroes Kyuss and added some 
psychedelic touches to their bottom-heavy rumble. Songs 
for the Deaf saw the band pushing the boundaries of its 
music, with epic suites, minute-long nods to death metal, 
and even the radio-ready singles No One Knows and 
Go with the Flow.
The signature sound of Queens of the Stone Age is still 
in place  thunderous down-tuned guitars (Homme has 
been known to plug his guitar into a bass amp for maxi
mum power), stop-and-start dynamics, and Hommes 
upper-register vocals define the bands sound for much

of the record. The front half of the album is loaded with 
sonic blasts like Medication, Everybody Knows that You 
Are Insane, and lead single Little Sister, that rein in the 
bands prog tendencies. ZZ Tops Billy Gibbons even drops 
by to add a staccato guitar break on Burn the Witch. By 
focusing their self-described robot rock, QOTSA allows 
plenty of time for the songs to evolve without letting the 
riffs become stale.
The lyrics on Lullabies to Paralyze contribute to the overall 
mood and tone of the album . Hommes subjects are per
haps more sinister than in previous efforts  the word 
blood seems to appear in nearly every track. Still, if the 
music is meant to play like a film, Homme is more inter
ested in his dialogues conveying suspense, emotion, and 
drama than sheer horror  no ones going to mistake this 
for a Slayer record.
The second half of the disc maintains the dark vision while 
balancing out the relatively concise A-side with longer, 
more dramatic pieces, like Someones in the Wolf and 
the closing track, Long Slow Goodbye. The quality of 
the songwriting dips a little toward the end  the unset
tling sexual advances of Skin on Skin and sluggish pace 
of You Got a Killer Scene There, Man detract from the 
albums tension and are ultimately distracting. Neverthe
less, the band is largely able to sustain the mood of the 
record for its nearly 60 minutes of running time.
Although full of sturdy riffs and melodies, theres little 
on this album that qualifies as pop per se, and it is nearly 
impossible to locate another track that might qualify as 
a single. Instead, Queens of the Stone Age have made a 
mature, remarkably coherent album that rewards patient 
listeners and solidifies the group as one of the most im
portant forces in modern hard rock.

A Fish Called Wanda
Wednesday, March 30 
< 8,10, and 12
This movie is a true comedy heist clas
sic. With a tight story line and onthe-cue jokes, it is the prelude to the 
major blockbusters of its kind, such as 
Oceans Eleven. There are endless jokes 
about the clash between the American 
and British cultures. Kevin Kline is 
absolutely hilarious as a dimwitted exCIA agent who helps Jamie Lee Curtis 
in her attempt to recover stolen jewels. 
Its an excellent and hilarious movie 
that only John Cleese, one of Monty 
Python's writers, could have written.
Gentl Disryil
Thursday, March 31 
@ 8,10,12
It is surprising that a French movie 
like Notre Musique does not depict 
Americans to be greedy, fat people. In 
fact one of the three parts of the movie, 
separated like Dantes Inferno, has par
adise portrayed as nature protected by 
U.S. Marines. As for the other two parts 
of the movie, Hell is a short section of 
the movie with a collage of images of 
war from all sources and aspects, and 
Purgatory is a conference in Sarajevo 
with contributors from all walks of 
life. Unfortunately, the movie jumps 
quickly from character to character and 
from subject to subject. It gives little 
time for the audience to absorb one far
fetched art reference before the next. 
This movie is a doozy to sit through; 
expect it to be thoroughly confusing.
The Life Aquatic 
with Steve Zissou
Friday, April 1 
@8,10,12
The Life Aquatic, which can only be 
described as odd, features Bill Murray 
as Steve Zissou, who is on a mission to 
capture the possibly mythical Jaguar 
Shark that killed his friend. While the 
plot may sometimes get lost in the sea 
of oddball characters, it is nonethe
less there. Character development and 
family relationships are the key focus 
of the film. Overall, the movie is fun to 
watch, with scenes lit up with vibrant 
colors and imaginative creatures. Even 
with action sequences and interesting 
CGI effects, things that are usually not 
found in Andersons films, this movie 
still features his dry humor and light 
comedic air.
Closer
Saturday, April 2 
@8,10,12
There is more screwing around and 
backstabbing among four people in this 
movie than in any soap opera. However, 
all the drama is done ever so tastefully 
and acted with raw emotion. You will 
be lost in the mesmerizing monologues 
of Clive Owen and be astonished by 
Natalie Portmans ability to hold up 
her screen time against the bigger stars
 Jude Law and Julia Roberts. This 
movie is truthful and brutal in its por
trayal of life and relationships. Scenes 
are tightly woven together with seem
ingly perfect performances and Damien 
Rices soothingly mellow love ballad.
Story of Women
Sunday, April 3 
@ 8,10, 12
Story of Women addresses the hotly 
debated topic of abortion. The main 
character, Marie Latour, was the last 
woman to be guillotined in France dur
ing the World War II period. She per
formed abortions on prostitutes and 
women who were impregnated by the 
Nazis occupying France. While Maries 
main role in the movie is as an abor
tionist, the movie also captures other 
aspects of her life, such as her role as 
a mother and an unfaithful wife. She 
allows her assistant to perform abor
tions when she is busy having an affair. 
Her character often provokes viewers to 
take a side. Overall, the movie is worth 
watching for its interesting backdrop 
and storyline.

The predictability of movies, explained
When the silver screen loses its sheen
You walk into the theater and sit in your favorite seat, 
smack-dab in the middle of the large, air-conditioned 
room. As the previews begin and you munch on your 
mouth-watering popcorn, you wonder whether this will 
be just another typical movie. You arent sure that you 
can handle another teen movie, like those from the 90s in 
which Freddie Prinze Jr. gets with the suddenly hot girl. 
Perhaps this will be one of those action-packed superhero 
movies where Spiderman kicks butt. Or better yet, it could 
be one of those movies where theres no concrete ending
 the kind of movie that ends abstractly and makes the 
audience think.
Lately, all movies seem to produce the same mindnumbing effect. Its either happily ever after, some sort 
of beautiful tragedy, two hours about nothing, or one of 
those strangely bizarre endings leaving you with a cold, 
empty feeling. Regardless of whether the director is 
trying to conform to the fantasies of society or choosing 
to be different from the norm, in the end, his efforts are 
wasted as more and more of the movies in our culture 
start fitting into the mold of a typical happily-unhappilyever-after movie.
The non-conformist movie directors have ironically 
conformed to the whims of pop culture. In the midst of 
everyone trying to make a distinct movie by weaving 
their own web of complex thoughts and concepts, most 
movies have become entangled in this mess we like to 
call individualism, otherwise known as the art of being 
unique. Movie moguls are unknowingly conforming to 
one of the most common recent movie trends: the antiinstitutional approach.
Audiences usually find themselves watching the same 
old chick flick where the girl leaves her husband/current 
boyfriend/fiancee, only to be reunited with her first 
love. The fact of the matter is that these movies are 
unrealistic since nobody ever finds themselves living a 
fairytale ending with no regard to the consequences of 
their actions. Unfortunately audiences no longer expect 
movies such as Sweet Home Alabama and The Notebook 
to be remotely realistic and dare to deviate from the 
Hollywood trend.
Then youve got the scary movies out in the world that 
reek of cliche and monotony. If youve seen one, youve 
seen them all. When was the last time you got scared at 
the movie theater? Weve watched so many horror movies 
that weve become numb to the effects that are being 
produced on-screen. The horror movie repertoire can 
only be transformed so many times, which explains why 
there are so many movies on the market that are parodies 
of scary movies. The typical scary movie, complete 
with hatchets, dead people, and unlimited goriness, no 
longer entertain audiences. With only hackneyed plot 
lines, directors have completely exhausted the horror 
movie narratives, leaving only parodies of these original 
thrillers to be made. Now were even making parodies of 
the parodies.
Of course there are the movies that dont fit into the chick 
flick or scary movie genres: the movies about nothing. 
While there are definitely entertaining bits and pieces 
to movies such as Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman, 
Zoolander, and Dodgeball, in the end, these movies are 
nothing but a waste of precious time.
Opposite from the movies about nothing are the thriller/ 
action movies, which are oozing with heroism, adventure, 
and justice. Although Harry Potter, 007, and Spiderman 
may seem like completely different individuals with 
nothing in common, they essentially come from the same 
roots. All three renowned pop icons have stopped evil, 
performed cool on-screen stunts, and rescued damsels in 
distress. If it werent for the fact that Harry has a cape and 
wand, Bond has a car to die for, and our dear Spidey can 
shoot webs from his fingers, you would think that these 
generic heroes were fraternal triplets.
Last but not least is the category of movies that fall 
under miscellaneous, simply because they all contain 
a predictably ambiguous resolution. When you are 
watching a movie like Big Fish or Lost in Translation, in 
the back of your mind you must be thinking, Where the 
heck is this movie going? This type of movie typically 
corners itself, leaving no other choice than up. In this 
case, up refers to a completely abstract and artistic

host in Lost in Translation.
conclusion  often leaving an unsettling feeling in the 
pit of the audiences stomach (or maybe thats what it 
feels like when you consume too much popcorn during 
the course of a two-and-a-half-hour movie).
So the question that remains is why we keep going back 
to these movies that scream of repetitiveness, monotony, 
and the same old same old. One reason may be that 
we like maintaining the status quo so much that if a 
director decided to make a movie that was completely 
unexpected and mind-boggling in every way possible, 
society would become befuddled in the process of 
adapting to new storylines and motifs. Or maybe the 
media industry has reached a saturation point where 
future growth is impossible. The hotshots in Hollywood 
have been so ambitious that they used up every inkling 
of creativity remaining in the world, leaving no scraps to 
chew on. Regardless, unless the movie industry wants to 
phase itself out of pop culture, theyve got to figure out 
something new and inspiring, ASAP, before they lose our 
patronage, attention, and loyalty forever.

Design Zone breathes new life into
Over 90 shops, studios, and exhibits display artist creations
When Mark Mentzer moved his painting studio into the 
heart of Lawrencevilles dilapidated business district
13 years ago, even his neighbors thought he was crazy. 
Crime was constant. Lots were vacant. And his circa-1890 
two-story building was close to being condemned. Dur
ing that first year, a business owner from across the street 
came over one day and shook his head at Mentzer with a 
mix of shock and admiration: Youve got some real guts 
moving in here.
But Mentzera Carnegie Mellon professor in the School 
of Design and one of the first in the 90-plus artists, archi
tects, artisans, and crafters that now populate Lawrencev
illes Design Zone  saw potential in the area that went 
beyond its cracked sidewalks and boarded-up windows. 
Theres that sense of pride and history in the place, 
he says, in an area with great possibilities. Now, Men
tzer and a slew of other artists and artisans are working 
actively to bring out those possibilities with the Design 
Zone, an urban redevelopment and neighborhood brand
ing initiative started with the Lawrenceville Corporation 
just five years ago.

Landing in Lawrenceville
At one pointbefore it was incorporated into Pittsburgh 
during the 19th centuryLawrenceville was its own 
township along the Allegheny River. After the turn of the 
century, Butler Street became one of the most vibrant 
business districts in the region. During this time local 
industry blossomed, and its streets were populated with 
the buildings that stand there today.
But once the steel mills and factories began closing in the 50s 
and 60s, money simply drained out of the area-businesses 
going with it. When Mentzer moved into the area in the early 
90s, his friend Joe Kelly had already worked in the neighbor
hood for eight years. Upon Mentzers suggestion, he moved 
Kelly Custom Furniture into a building that on the same 
block as Mentzers studio, and it was already condemned.
The two friends were planting the seeds of something 
larger than their own businesses. In 2000, the Law
renceville Corporation was formed by a merger between 
two other Lawrenceville groups that shared a common 
interest. With the help of Mentzer and Kelly now the or
ganizations executive director their Design Zone concept 
could finally hit the streets.
The Zone
The Design Zone extends across the ninth and tenth wards 
of Pittsburgh  the Strip District and Lawrenceville. The 
group was founded in 2000 with 78 shops, galleries, and 
studios. Now, close to five years later, that number has 
jumped to over 90.
The Design Zone starts a new neighborhood, in essence, 
says Pam Devereaux, the Lawrenceville Corporations 
business manager. [It] crosses traditional neighborhood 
boundaries  a new type of place based on what we have 
to offer. Its making waves, too, boosting the economy 
of Lawrenceville through the efforts of Design Zone 
members, all working between the 16th Street and 62nd 
Street bridges along Butler Street. Artists, she says, are 
often the first pioneers into blighted neighborhoods that 
have potential for redevelopment.
There is an intense collection of artisans lining Butler 
Street today, from antique furniture restoration to interior 
design services. Individual artists studios to custom 
architectural millwork. Candle makers to cabinetmakers. 
Metalworkers to muralists. Walking down the street, you 
can tell which storefronts belong to the Design Zone: 
more often than not, theyre the ones with fully restored 
moldings, large bay windows, and brightly colored 
paint that blast life into an otherwise gray Pittsburgh 
afternoon. The stately Allegheny Cemetery separates the
Lawrenceville
districts two ends along Butler, and the road twists over 
a long, rolling hill on its way from one bridge to the other. 
In storefronts like Roger Levines Who New? for retro 
furniture, a brightly colored flag hangs from just above 
its windows: 16:62 DESIGN ZONE.
The reason we opened this shop in Lawrenceville was 
because of the Design Zone. Its a real grassroots area to 
be in, says Levine. Before the Zone came into the dis
trict, Lawrenceville wasnt even an option for Levine and 
Who New? co-owner Jeff Gordon. There was no reason 
to come here five years ago. You wouldnt come here five 
years ago.
A colorful program Levine points to are stacked neatly 
near his entranceway. The guidebooks have become an 
integral part of the Design Zone effort. Now in its fourth 
edition of printing, the latest version came off the press 
only a few months ago. Although the guidebook has been 
requested by people across the country, its already out of 
date. More businesses have moved in since its printing, 
and the maps on each page dont yet include them on the 
list. The growth is shocking, and its only increasing its rate.
The stipulation is just that you design! Levine laughs. 
He and Gordon have amassed their shops eclectic col
lection of retro furniture from literally everywhere they 
visit: Theyve picked up picture frames from Japan, tables 
from Italy, and still hunt at auctions and garage sales. Its 
a 24/7, he says as he sits at one of his tables in the middle 
of the store. The lighting is comfortable, almost as if it 
were a living room; the furniture around him ranges from 
50s chic to 05 college apartment. Its taken a hobby to 
another level.
Playing the CMU design card
To begin a venture like this, you have to market it. And 
the marketing for the Strip and Lawrencevilles Design 
Zone began with a business district in Portland, Oregon. 
From there, it was up to about 14 students at Carnegie 
Mellon to run with it.
Talking in his studio, Mentzer describes how Joe Kelly 
took a trip to Oregon one day and returned with a walk
ing map of a Portland business district. The map, Kelly 
pointed out, was organized around the notion of related 
businesses: It was clear, it was visual, and a cursory glance 
gave you a solid notion of how the area could be navi
gated according to taste. Joe came up with this idea, 
says Mentzer. Since most of the businesses in this area 
were related to the building industry, home furnishings, 
furniture, antiquesall these things that have to do with 
design in some waywouldnt it be kind of neat if we cre
ated a zone where all these businesses were connected?

---------------------------------------------------

Mark Mentzer narrates through 
the process of his work inside 
his Studio on Butler Street. 
Mentzer, who has owned Men
tzer Studio for more than 10 
years, was one of the first artists 
to open up shop in the Zone. He 
and several artists took a huge 
risk when they chose to locate 
their shops between Lawrenceville and The Strip years ago, 
since the area was crime-ridden 
and desolate.
And so, soon after the Design Zone was founded, 12 to
14 students from CMUs design department took on Lawrenceville as a senior design project. The students took in 
topography, the people, and the individual needs of the 
area, as well as area history. Their project wasnt neces
sarily conducted with the Design Zone in mind, but rather 
the district as a whole: Mentzer says the goal was to find 
how some design intervention in the area [could] put it 
on the map, and champion what we already have here. 
This made their senior project, in effect, problem-solving 
design for an entire community.
The team drew up six proposals to incorporate the dy
namics of the area  a logo, a letterhead, a sign system, 
and so on. They developed a system for the local office so 
that they could produce their printed material in-house; 
and soon afterwards developed the map brochures that 
mirrored Kellys findings in Portland. And they thought 
up a visual historic site so that they could communicate 
the historic aspects of the area. They [the Lawrenceville 
Corporation] still use that material in their thinking, 
Mentzer says: CMU students made the blueprint, and the 
project grew from their efforts.
Mentzer Studio
Each studio effort has sought to keep intact what history 
Butler Street offers. Mentzer and other artists have taken 
that to heart when moving into their buildings  to re
vive rather than reinvent.
I think we have a tendency to want to clean the slate, 
Mentzer says, gesturing about his studio. And weve got 
a very rich slate here. And what of that richness should 
be preserved, can be preserved? Hes talked about the 
various storefronts earlier, and how organizations like 
the Urban Redevelopment Authority have helped put 
money into restoring their facades and preserving the 
buildings. So youre going to see new buildings here, he 
grins, but I dont think youll see that sort of strip-mall 
[mentality].
Mentzers own studio has had a varied past, of which he 
only knows bits and pieces  a bar at one point, a pho
tography studio at another. During his first year, when 
he was clearing out the low-ceilinged basement, an older 
man approached him on the sidewalk and asked abruptly: 
Hey, did you find any dead bodies in there? Apparently, 
it was a morgue as well.
So he jacked the floor up, rebuilt the roof, rewired the 
building, re-plumbed with his father-in-law 12 years ago. 
The space is clean now, with white walls covered in paint
ings and drawings that share common themes of color 
and line qualities. It has allowed him to open up and ex
plore his own style; his finished products, both still life 
and abstract at once, give a sense of the creativity that has 
fueled his teaching at CMU for thirty years.
But although Mentzer has taught everyone from interna
tional artist Burton Morris to the CMU graduates at Wall
Designing for tomorrow
Lawrenceville is rebuilding itself, its ways both visible and 
intangible. Kate Lydon from the Society for Contempo
rary Craft says that the Blackbird Lofts, for example, are 
[some] of the first new buildings built since the 1960s in 
the area. Artists are moving in as far away as New York 
City, and even the UPMC is planning a new Childrens 
Hospital in the neighborhood. We are at a point, Lydon 
says, where a lot of great things are happening at the 
same time.
On Thursday nights, businesses have their lights on until 
eight in the evening  and the glow as you drive down 
Butler is a tangible reminder of how the area has changed 
in the past five years. Its not like a trend, though, says 
Mentzer. Its not going to fizzle out. This is long-lasting.

Wilburs cruise was scheduled for two weeks from the day he went to visit his 
travel agent. It would travel all around the Caribbean, bobbing about between 
various islands. Wilbur could not wait. The travel agent, Carlow Brack, told him 
that there would be lots of other young ducks on the cruise traveling south for 
the winter. Wilbur wasnt usually lonely, but during this particular winter he felt 
particularly forlorn. His house seemed empty and cold. He felt detached from his 
co-workers. He sent out a handful of holiday cards and got only three in return, 
one of which was from his podiatrist. Along with his relationships, Wilbur was 
also letting his personal appearance slip away. His belly was getting thicker every 
month and he only slapdashedly groomed his feathers in the morning. When he 
got back from Carlows office, Wilbur tried on some swimming trunks, which 
he would undoubtedly need for the cruise. He hadnt worn them in years, and 
they were quite tight. Wilbur looked at himself in the mirror, displeased. He 
had two weeks to snap himself back into shape, and he was determined to do it.

HOROSCOPES
BY LARA VOIGT
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Now that Room Draw is over and youre 
destined to live another year with your friend, try not to crash his 
computer or lock him out at 3 am because locks can be changed and your 
girlfriends roommate really wont appreciate you spending the night every 
night.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Your week of hell is finally over, so do 
something nice for someone you care about  theyll really appreciate it. 
Or theyll just shove it back in your face; either way, youll get an honest 
response.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Its starting to warm up outside, and theres 
love in the air, so if youre single, take some action. But if youre attached, 
well, your significant other probably won't take the explanation Its spring;
I just had to!
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Last week was bad. Really, really bad. Dont 
expect too much more this week.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Over the weekend you might have found that 
you have some talents you didnt know about. Put them to use and good 
things will come your way this week. On the other hand, people might not 
enjoy squirrel juggling that much anymore...
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Youve been holed up in your room 
studying for two weeks straight now, and in the long run it might actually 
pay off... or youll just get an uncontrollable urge to throw your physics book 
out the window next time you see it.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Although making your girlfriend feel 
special every day is a 24-hour job, try to remember that shes not actually 
your girlfriend, and that leaving her anonymous notes in her dorm room is 
not the way to remedy that.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Gambling isnt your forte. Think 
about that the next time your roommate starts playing blackjack with those 
really sketchy-looking guys... remember last time when you woke up in the 
woods with the feeling you werent in Pittsburgh anymore?
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Sometimes things just fall 
into place, and you really know what you want to do with your life. This 
week really is not going to be one of them.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Its warming up, people are 
outside, and maybe an athletic display is just the thing to get you that girl 
youve been watching all winter. Its not a bad idea; just try pick a sport 
youre actually good at, or one that doesn't involve flying objects. Getting 
hit with a frisbee? Not attractive.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Agoraphobia: an abnormal fear of 
people or public spaces. Spring really isnt your time. Find some indoor 
activities to do, like reading. Just not studying.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Your singing ability is really taking off. 
At least, you think so, but if your roommates have this strange habit of 
wearing headphones when you start singing, that might be a cue to keep 
your talents to the shower.

Comickaze
Max Rants About Bad Comics
(Scene: Max enters the room wearing an orange jumpsuit, 
pinioned by two prison guards. Hes wearing a black do-rag 
on his head, which is pretty absurd given his nerdy demeanor. 
Television cameras are rolling while he addresses a group of 
troubledyoung men for a Scared Straight session.)
So little punks, youre reading Comickaze now, huh? ing 
Comickaze! Do you ing think that makes you a big man to 
be in the big house, huh?  that! Youre just a little punk; 
youre nobody! Nobodyl You think reading comics makes 
you cool? Do you know where youre going to end up? 
Youre looking at it, right ing here! Look at me! Im your 
ing future. This is what comics do to people!
(One of the audience members makes an arrogant smirk and 
rolls his eyes. Max lunges forward and gets right in his face.)
Whats so ing funny, huh?! You dont think youre going to 
end up here on the last page of the Pillbox?! Get your head 
out of your ing anus! I know what youre thinking; I know 
what youre all thinking! You saw Spiderman at ing Loews 
and bought some guys bull about superheroes being our 
last American cultural vestige of classical hero-epics. Now 
youre buying a few issues every ing month! You think 
you can do that and still have a normal ing life? You think 
youre not hurting your loved ones and those around you?
 you man! You dont think anything! You dont know  
about anything!
(The guards restrain Max in his fervor. He throws up his hands 
and they let him go. Max collects himself.)
I used to be just like you, man. I thought I had it all. I 
thought comics were just, like, cheap thrills. ing X-Men, 
yknow man? Pretty soon its all I could talk to people about 
anymore. It sucked me into its asinine little world, that and 
all of the other ing mainstream comics. I was spending 
clams like a smoker with a habit. You cant do that . Youre 
clean, you gotta stay away from the  that got me. One day 
youre going to wake up jerking off to a Jim Lee drawing 
of Poison Ivy, writing to internet forums about the ing 
chronological impossibility of Peter Parker, and yelling at 
kids in Barnes & Noble who wait for graphic novel collections 
to come out instead of buying the ing individual issues. 
Is that what its gonna take for you to ing listen?! Dont 
make that ing mistake!! Its a one-strike system!!
(Max surveys the room, like a cat inspecting its prey. He points 
directly at a boy who is averting his eyes, glancing at the 
floor.)
You! Yeah, you! What did you do to land here?
(The delinquent is in an abashed state. He stutters out his 
answer:)
I... I bought all the different variant covers for the Age of 
Apocalypse redux mini-s-s-series...
(Max is visibly amused.)
Age ofApocdid you say Age of Apocalypse?! , man. As if 
all of us sniveling fanboys didnt sink enough of our lunchmoney into that, youre ing letting Marvel pull that stuff 
a -gain?! Can you even look at yourself in a mirror? Thats 
ing sick, man! A whole series centered on X-Men cliches 
and overly-trendy costumes drawn in Chris Bachalos super
copied cookie-cutter-clutter style? I tried that deal, man. It 
stunted my intellectual growth for ing years, man.
(Max turns to another delinquent.)
Now you, what did you do?
(The boy looks Max straight in the eye, unconvincingly feigning 
courage)
I read DCs Identity Crisis this summer!
(Max is horrified.)
Identity Criseeeeeeeees? You paid DC comics to gratify 
themselves, drawing every single one of their one
dimensional, muscle-bound, vaguely homoerotic 
superheroes all over ever page in more gratuitously 
cheesecake poses than is usually produced. It is impossible 
to even pretend that the kids DC supposedly ing writes 
for would even care about that kind of ing fan-service, 
and by service I do mean sexually.
Im going to break it all down for you: The world is filled with 
ing bad comics. Are you going to read those comics, or 
are you going to straighten yourself out and find something 
actually worth reading? Get off the smack or youre gonna 
get smacked! Find something that spells comics with a k 
or an x or something, or I dunno, why not try actually 
reading one of the comics I *plug* in this column instead 
of just scratching your little heads because you dont know 
anything to do with what Im ing writing about.
(The preceding was either ironic or meta-ironic. You pick.)
