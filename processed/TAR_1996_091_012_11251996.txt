Senate impeaches treasurer
By AMIT N. KAR
Tartan Business Manager
. Student Senate voted unanimously last Mon
day night to impeach Senate Treasurer Brian 
Mueller. The move stems from Muellers contin
ued absence at Senate meetings and a general 
perception among senators that he has not been 
fulfilling the responsibilities of his office.
He has not been to a single meeting since the 
first one, where he was installed as treasurer, 
said. Matt Bembenick, junior 
policy management major and 
Senate public relations chair.
There are three meetings a 
month, added Mike Szudarek, 
sophomore IDS major and hu
man resources chair. You do 
the math.
Mueller has a slightly differ
ent perspective on the whole 
situation. Its probably just a j 
matter of miscommunication, 
he said. He has attributed his absence at Senate 
meetings to a class conflict and indicated that
first month when we can really tell if organiza
tions are on the wrong track or not, he said.
However, th lack of information from the 
treasurer has caused a good deal of uncertainty 
within Senate, especially where the disburse
ment of Activities Fund money is concerned. To 
some within Senate, the treasurers role goes 
beyond whistleblowing to instilling a sense of 
fiscal confidence.
Student Senate allocates half a million dol
lars and the treasurer is the balance to ensure
We gave away $100,000 tonight. 
We don't know where 20 percent of 
the Student Activities fund went,  
 Matt Bembenick, 
Senate PR Chair
that we are doing our job properly, said 
Szudarek. There is no way of telling now 
there has been little need for his input. If whether or not the organizations receiving
theres a problem, the treasurer will tell you. 
Otherwise, things are going okay.
One of his primary roles as treasurer is to 
evaluate student organization expenditures and 
to take corrective action when an organization 
overspends or spends in violation of Senate 
rules. In Muellers estimation, it is too early for 
him to be making that kind of judgment on 
student organization spending. January is the
money are following fiscal policy. We have no 
way of knowing that theyre not throwing keg 
parties, Bembenick added, We gave away 
$100,000 tonight. We dont know where 20 per
cent of the Student Activities fund went.
Its unfortunate any time something like 
this happens  when Senate has to consider 
removing an elected official from office, said

ECE students line up for classes, deal with registration crunch
Jy BECKY A. COWSER
"artan News Editor
Last week, some sophomore and junor electrical and computer engineering 
ECE) majors huddled in their sleeping 
ags outside of the ECE department. 
According to various ECE majors, this is 
common practice come registration 
ime. People have to sleep outside the 
egistration room because they want to 
fuarantee they get into the classes they 
vant, said Jason Siegendorf, a junior 
ICE major.
I sympathize with [the students], and 
think its terrible that we have a situ
ation like it  that a University doesnt 
lave a computerized registration with 
ome kind of lottery system, said Bob 
Write, head of the ECE department, 
[fs not only an inconvenience for the 
Students, its an inconvenience for the 
vhole staff.
One possible reason for the long regis
tration lines could be that ECE does not 
have any pre-registration process.
My intention is to look into [pre-registration] to see if it would alleviate the 
problem, or only transfer it, said Ed 
Schlesinger, ECE associate department 
head. If we knew that [pre-registra
tion] would solve this particular prob
lem, we would institute it, but I think 
the real solutionis to institute a comput
erized registration.
Last year we tried pre-registration 
and only 50 percent of the students 
showed up. Thats why we didnt try it 
this year, said White.
Honestly I think that pre-registration would be useless, because youd run 
into the same problem only a week ear
lier, said Hitesh Soneji, a senior ECE 
major. You wonder why there is a line, 
and obviously it is because people want 
to get in the most popular classes. So
maybe if they would offer more sections 
or maybe have two professors teach those 
classes, that would help.
Theres another problem too, 
Schlesinger said. I feel part of the prob
lem, by no means all of it, but part of the 
problem is that students are keen on 
getting into a particular section, not so 
much that a particular course would be 
closed, but they want to get [to registra
tion] early to get a specific time or day 
[for a class].
In a sense, it is a result of our success, 
were a popular program and student 
retention rate is up, said White.
Its also true that we have an unusu
ally largesophomore class this year, 
Schlesinger added. That goes back to 
our target number being 150 students 
per [ECE] class. [This sophomore class] 
has 180 students.
With the unusually large amount of 
students the ECE program has, regis
tration processes are causing many dif
ficulties for students.
I got up at 5 am, got [to the ECE office] 
at 6 am, and I didnt get any classes I 
wanted, said AnupWadia, a junior ECE 
major. I signed up for four classes and 
only got into one that was my backup. I 
got into three out of the four the classes 
I was wait-listed for, but thats only 
because I was lucky.
I think if you talk to students, theyll 
say, Im still on the waiting list, but 
what happens is we increase the num
ber of students in a class, and then that 
student [who was wait-listed] drops the 
classes they took as back up, so more 
space opens up for others.... Its a big 
avalanche process that wont be allevi
ated until the first day of classes, said 
Schlesinger.
I think registration will always be 
this way, said Wadia. This year was 
the worst.... I think they should really
take into consideration that students 
need time to sleep, especially at the end 
of the semester.
My understanding is that [for] the 
registration that will take place in the 
spring [for the fall 1997 semester], the 
registrar will be implementing comput
erized registration on a trial basis, and 
in a semester or two, we will be fully 
computerized, said Schlesinger.
This semester we are going to wait 
until the smoke settles, and if we have 
to add more sections we will, said 
White.
Bottom line  its a terrible inconve
nience, and I dont think the students 
should have to camp out [for classes.] 
Thats not right, said Schlesinger. But 
I think most every student gets into the 
course they want eventually.

Political analyst speaks at CMU
*y PRATISH RAO HALADY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I would sit on a bucket and 
xplain to [the people], said 
uidrei Safirov, a senior anayst and political scientist as 
veil as a professor of history 
rom Russia, relating his expejiences from lecturing in Rus
han grocery stores.
Last Thursday, Safirov visted CMU to give a lecture on 
Political, economic, and social 
elations between the Russian 
^deration and the United 
?tates. He has written three 
?ooks on the subject of Ameri
can politics and has traveled 
J^dely throughout the United 
States and Russia. He aims to 
make Russians and Americans 
understand each other better, 
and has been giving lectures for 
,ver 20 years in both Russia 
lnd the United States on this 
utyect in locations ranging 
rm universities to grocery stores.
In his lecture Thursday he 
Scribed how the Russian Fed
eration is changing both politi
cly and economically. Eco
nomically, he explained how the
dn!um Pke.empulbfrnlonm CMuou vpHoul 
Andrei Safirov explained the political and economic structure of Russia.
Russians are trying to shift from a 
command economy to a capitalist 
one. In the communist economy 
several years ago, everything be
longed to the government, and the 
people owned almost nothing. 
There was no competition because 
people were not allowed to have 
their own companies, hence the 
quality of goods was very low.
Youd buy a car and it would 
break on the way from the store to
your home, Safirov said.
Consumer goods, including 
food, were rationed. People were 
given a certain number of tickets 
with which to purchase the food 
they needed. He explained that 
after the shift towards a capital
ist economy, the presence of high 
quality imports lessened the de
mand for the poorly-made goods.

Russia pulls troops out of neighboring Chechnya
MOSCOW, Nov. 23 (AP)  Ending a 
dispute between Moscow and Chechen 
separatists, President Boris Yeltsin or
dered the withdrawal of two remaining 
brigades from Chechnya last Saturday.
Under a peace agreement reached 
between the two sides in August, all 
Russian troops were to pull out by the 
end of the year. But until now, Rus
sian officials had insisted that the two 
brigades would be permanently based 
in the separatist republic.
Separatist leaders have demanded 
that the brigades be withdrawn, saying 
their presence would obstruct plans to 
hold elections in Chechnya in January.
Yeltsins decree appeared to clear 
the way for a new agreement signed 
Saturday outside Moscow by Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdins 
office and Aslan Maskhadov, the 
Chechen government head.
Russian national security chief Ivan 
Rybkin met on Friday with Chechen 
separatist leaders to fine-tune the word
ing of the agreement, spelling out basic 
principles of relations between Mos
cow and the breakaway republic.
Yeltsins decree, released by his press 
service to Russian news agencies, said 
the brigades will be withdrawn to 
guarantee the further peaceful settle
ment in the Chechen republic, the 
demilitarization of the Chechen re
public and to create conditions for 
democratic elections.
The president ordered the Interior 
Ministrys 101st brigade and the De
fense Ministrys 205th motorized bri
gade to be redeployed elsewhere in 
the north Caucasus region, and told 
the Russian government to take steps 
to provide housing for the troops and 
their families.
The troops will be out of Chechnya 
before parliamentary and presidential 
elections on Jan. 27, said Yeltsin press 
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
The Chechen people have been 
given the opportunity to make their 
choice not at machine-gun point, 
Yastrzhembsky said.
Since the August cease-fire, which 
halted 20 months of fighting, the 
two sides have made progress on a 
series of agreements spelling out 
relations between Moscow and the 
breakaway republic.
The August accord, however, did 
not resolve the thorny question of 
Chechnyas final political status. The 
separatists want independence, while 
the Russians insist the republic must 
remain part of Russia.
The war in Chechnya began in De
cember 1994 when Yeltsin sent in 
troops to put down the mostly Muslim 
regions self-declared independence.
Point Park and Duquesne merger talks have ended
PITTSBURGH, Nov. 22 (AP)  
Talks to merge Point Park College 
into Duquesne University have ended 
over concerns that the deal would not 
succeed financially.
The breakdown of negotiations re
newed worries about Point Parks fi
nancial health. The school has said it 
anticipates ending its fiscal year Au
gust 31 with an $80,000 surplus out of 
a $22 million budget.
The talks ended after a meeting 
Thursday at Duquesne. Duquesne 
decided a merger or affiliation would 
not have fit with Duquesnes current 
strategic plan, said Duquesne presi
dent John Murray.
The question [was] to what extent 
would that plan be interrupted be
cause of what we would have to do at 
Point Park, Murray said.
Both schools said they would pursue 
smaller cooperation ventures involv
ing Duquesnes music schools, Point 
Parks performing arts programs, and 
the $12.5 million library Point Park 
hopes to open in conjunction with the 
Carnegie library system.
Point Park had approached
Duquesne in April with the merger 
idea, hoping to secure $10 million 
it said was needed to stay competi
tive with other colleges. The school 
has struggled with enrollment and 
budget problems throughout its 36- 
year history.
The schools had hoped to save about 
$5 million a year each, by eliminating 
redundant bureaucracies and imple
menting new information technology.
The merger idea also ended because 
both schools decided they could not 
meet a self-imposed year-end dead
line to complete the talks. Point Park 
wanted a quick resolution so it could 
decide on a new president from among 
four finalists.
Last week Gerald McGinnis, chair
man of Point Parks board of trust
ees, said the school would make a 
statement Friday.
About 2,300 students are enrolled 
at Point Park, up 3.6 percent from last 
year. The school has a $4.5 million 
endowment.
There are about 9,400 students en
rolled at Duquesne University, which 
has a $70 million endowment.
UN to decide aid for Zaire refugees
ROME, Nov. 22 (AP)A team ofU.N. 
aid specialists will help decide the course 
of relief operations for more than one 
million refugees in central Africa, a U.N. 
food agency said Friday.
The six-member team from the Romebased Food and Agriculture Organiza
tion includes experts in agronomy and 
water control. They are expected to be
gin work in Rwanda early next week. 
Another group of technicians from the 
agency are expected to arrive later to try 
to improve Rwandas livestock supplies.
During last weeks U.N. World Food 
Summit in Rome, the agency issued an 
appeal for $4.9 million in emergency 
'funds for the refugees in eastern Zaire, 
Rwanda, and Burundi.
Last week, refugees started pouring 
out of Zaire, where they fled in 1994 to 
escape the bloodshed in their homelands.
The U.N. Security Council voted last 
week to send a Canadian-led multina
tional force of up to 12,000 troops to help 
get food to the refugees. The United 
States has promised about 1,000 logis
tics specialists and $140 million to help 
the refugees.
Representatives from over 25 countries 
met in Stuttgart, Germany to discuss the 
scope and objectives of the mission now 
that refugees are returning home.
Hijacked airliner crashes in ocean
MORONI, Comoros Islands, Nov. 23 
(AP)  An Ethiopian airliner, believed 
to have been hijacked with 178 passen
gers aboard, crashed Saturday on a beach 
of the Comoros Islands in the Indian 
Ocean, Radio Comoros reported.
Various reports indicated that dozens 
of passengers were killed. Witnesses said 
there were at least 16 survivors.
Arsident of Moroni, the capital of the 
island group, told The Associated Press 
that state radio reported the crash oc
curred at Mitsamiuti Beach on the north 
side of Grande Comore Island sometime 
after midday.
Donies Pornage, a Swiss resident of the 
island, said the radio report asked all 
hospitals to prepare to treat survivors.
Israel radio said the Ethiopian Air
lines Boeing 767 plunged into the water 
off Grande Comore Island, splitting into 
at least two parts. It said the plane may 
have tried to make an emergency land
ing after running out of fuel, and that a 
search for survivors was under way on 
the island nation between Madagascar 
and Mozambique.
Israeli radio reported earlier Satur
day that the plane was hijacked by 11 
Ethiopians in Addis Ababa, the Ethio
pian capital. The control tower at 
Nairobis airport said it happened be
fore the plane entered Kenyan air space.
Israeli radio reporter Mickey Gourdis 
had been monitoring transmissions 
from the plane and the air traffic con
trol tower in Addis Ababa. Flight 661 
had been enroute from Bombay, India, 
to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, said T.P. 
Venkatnarayan, Bombay duty officer 
for Air-India, which handles Ethiopian 
Airlines flights in India.
It was then scheduled to become Flight 
961 and travel to Nairobi, Brazzavile, 
Congo, and Abidjan.
Gourdis said the hijackers demanded 
to be flown to Australia and that the 
plane was en route to the Indian Ocean 
island of Mauritius to refuel when it 
crashed near Grand Comore off the coast 
of Mozambique.
An airport spokesman in the Comoros 
Islands said he received a message about 
the airplane from Tanzania. But we 
have no news on it, said Mamoune 
Chakira, spokesman for the Hayaya In
ternational Airport in Moroni.
Miss World critics use bomb threats
BANGALORE, India, Nov. 21 (AP)  
The Miss World pageant is being held in 
India for the first time, and its critics are 
making sure its the last.
There have been bomb threats and 
court challenges. Someone smeared cow 
dung on the products of corporate spon
sors. And a man set himself on fire, a 
time-honored form of suicide as protest.
The beauty queens have been under 
tight security during the two weeks of 
preliminary rounds before Saturdays 
coronation. Grim-faced, khaki-clad po
lice officers guard their hotel, shielding 
the women from protesters who say the 
contest violates Indian culture, dehu
manizes women, and wastes resources 
in one of the worlds poorest countries.
Opponents lost a lawsuit this week 
when a judge refused to ban the pag
eant. But they won another lawsuit 
Thursday, when a judge ruled that the 
pageant ball couldnt be held at an Air 
Force training center for fear of giving 
the appearance of state sponsorship.
Organizers moved the ball, but that 
was the least of their problems.
Police s ay the most serious threat comes 
from a previously unknown group, the 
Indian Tigers, who have claimed respon
sibility for four small bombings in Banga
lore since the beauty queens came to 
town. The bombings caused little dam
age and no injuries, but the Tigers said 
they plan a bigger explosion Saturday.
Pageant planners have done their best 
to protect the contestants from the pro
tests, such as the crowd of 800 that 
staged a sit-in Sunday on a road near 
the pageant site. More than 1,500 police 
officers are to be deployed around the 
stadium Saturday night, and elite fed
eral police will be on standby.
Despite the controversy, the 88 women 
have made public appearances, smiling 
and waving as they compete to become 
Miss World 1996.
We have been very busy and we have 
not been able to see anything of India, 
said Miss United Kingdom Rachel 
Warner as she prepared for a dress re
hearsal Thursday.
At other times, the contestants hav 
been gliding down fashion ramps ft] 
prehminary-round contests such as Miss 
Photogenic and Miss Personality. Bu 
no swimsuits. The contests Indian spon. 
sors moved that competition to anothe 
countrythe Seychelles Islands, north' 
east of Madagascarto avoid offendij 
the modesty of some in Indias mostl 
Hindu population.
Activists rarely find it difficult to sti 
up passions in India, a country of 93( 
million people struggling with poverty 
volatile class and religious divisions 
and a history of protest.
Still, Miss World opponents seem 
ignore that Indias vibrant film industr, 
trades in sex and images of scantily clad 
women, and that beauty pageants are 
nothing new hereAishwarya Rai won 
the countrys national pageant in 1994 
and went on to be crowned Miss World.
Some question whether opponents 
which range from right-wing parties to 
avowed communists, have simply seizet 
on the arrival of an international even 
as a chance to gain publicity.
Why should they want to bum them 
selves? asked Avinash Nagraj, a 20

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (Reuter)
A CIA employee was in custody Monda 
on charges he passed classifiedinforma 
tion to Russia, a published report said.
The New York Times reported the CIA 
employee was arrested Saturday in Vir
ginia after a lengthy investigation.
His name was not released.
The suspect's espionage work began 
as early as 1994, and perhaps as early as 
1991 before the collapse of the Soviet 
empire, the Times reported.
Officials said the nature of the com
promised information was hot clear, but 
they suspected the employee had access 
to an array of security documents about 
former East bloc states.
The suspect reportedly had been an 
instructor who trained other officials 
of the agency and had also been sta 
tioned overseas. In recent months he had 
been reassigned to the agency's 
counterterrorism unit to limit his access to 
classified materials.
This case comes as the CIA is recover
ing from the damage caused by another 
mole, Aldrich Ames, who is serving a life 
prison term for selling secrets to Mos
cow over a 10-year period.
Last week, a spy case against a former 
Russian intelligence officer was 
dropped after American intelligence 
officials intervened with federal au
thorities. The latest case and the one 
involving the Russian are not linked, 
the paper reported.
Officials said the arrest by counterin
telligence agents of the FBI had been 
planned under tight security out of fear 
the suspect might flee if tipped.

50 YEARS AGO, Jan. 14,1947: 
Students prepared for the second 
annual King of Hearts Ball.
Each fraternity or student or
ganization submitted a picture of 
their candidate for the title of 
King of Hearts to The Tartan. 
Elections were held prior to the 
event, as opposed to the first com
petition, where the King was 
elected at the dance.
The previous year, promoters 
for the event were more spirited 
than the campus was used to. 
Besides putting up the typical 
posters, the various groups spon
soring candidates painted the 
sidewalks, entertained Skibo-ites 
with songs and cheers, and the 
Betas enlisted the support of a 
reverend to win the title.
25 YEARS AGO, Dec. 9,1971: 
Vince Misitano, the president of 
Student Government, resigned at 
a Senate meeting. In a letter to 
Senate, Misitano attributed ... 
rising pressures in my academic 
activities... as being responsible 
for his resignation. Misitano was 
enrolled in GSIA at the time.
His resignation caused a cas
cade of rearrangements in Senate.
The president was replaced by the 
Chair of Senate, Mike Garl. A new 
chairman was elected to replace 
Garl. This in turn caused a new 
standing committee of chairs to be 
elected. Chairs were elected for the 
finance, general campus, rules, and 
information committees.
Senators present at the meet
ing choose what committees they 
would belong to, while absent 
Senators had to choose between 
the unfilled rules and informa
tion committees.
TEN YEARS AGO, Jan. 13, 
1987: A break in the main water 
line disabled Skibo and inconve
nienced students heading to their 
first classes of the semester.
The break occured at 5:17 am. 
University Dining Services was 
notified of the break at 7 am and 
Physical Plant was forced to shut 
off the water in Skibo at 8 am in 
order to make repairs.
The break was attributed to 
age, since it occurred in the origi
nal water pipe servicing Skibo. 
The shifting of the ground and 
the freeze-thaw cycle that is com
mon this time of year may have 
contributed to the break.
The pipe was not replaced; in
stead a stainless steel clamp was 
placed to prevent future prob
lems. Water was fully restored to 
Skibo at 3:10 pm.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Nov. 25, 
1991: Controversy raged over 
ROTC issues. A Phi O, which 
runs Student Senate elections, 
received four complaints regard
ing the process, but only one was 
specifically against ROTC influ
ences at the elections.
Members of the gay community 
and ROTC gathered at the Senate 
meeting. NROTC commander Ken 
Wilson askedfor Senate to repeal its 
resolution against discrimination in 
ROTC. Wilson said a campus-wide 
referendum was absolutely neces
sary to determine if students felt 
ROTCs policy was discriminatory.
A senator-at-large agreed with 
ROTCs position and stated that 
according to Senates Constitu
tion, if a petition was signed by 
250 students, Senate must hold a 
referendum within three weeks 
of validating the signatures.
ONE YEAR AGO, Dec. 4,1995: 
Just before 11 am Sunday, the
entire Andrew network c<

failures. Email, newsgroups, 
AppleTalk, the Windows net
work, and Internet connectivity

to take a stand. Were looking at [the
sue] from a standpoint of organiza
tional survival. Take away the frater
nities and then see how much school 
spirit there is on campus. [The Uni
versity] doesnt see the good that fra
ternities do. They take the fraterni
ties for granted, said Bembenick.
Bembenick also cited some other prob
lems that the fraternities are having 
regarding the housing issue.
First, the fraternity system doesnt 
have the money to do a rental survey 
ourselves, said Bembenick. I cant 
speak for the other houses, but at 
least Kap Sig is having problems 
meeting their lease. When the houses 
were built ... the fraternities had to 
donate $50,000 towards the construc
tion. Ifit cost $200,000 to build, weve 
paid over $2.5 million toward the
house ... dont charge us for some
thing weve already paid for.
The fraternity system is optimis
tic about the outcome of having a 
private appraiser perform a sur
vey. It will allow them to gain le
verage by having their own set of 
data to present to the University, 
and credibility through the Stu
dent Senate.
Although $2,000 has already 
been allotted to the fraternity sys
tem and the fraternities expect to 
have figures by the end of Janu
ary, nothing definite has been de
cided between any organization 
and Landmark Appraisals.
According to Rosemary Nolte, 
owner and senior appraiser at 
Landmark, Nothings concrete 
and nothings tied down with the 
purpose of doing a rental survey. 
Her son Jacob Nolte, the appraiser 
who apparently spoke with some
one in the fraternity system, has 
only barely made contact with any
one at Carnegie Mellon.
Charges brought against treasurer
SENATE, from page 1
student body president, Bryon Krug, 
an ECE/EPP junior. He is a student 
first, but he is the treasurer too, and 
has a lot of responsibilities. When 
you take those responsibilities on, 
you have to fulfill them.
Krug, along with Student Senate 
chair, Catherine Senderling, met 
Mueller on Friday to discuss mat
ters and to invite Mueller to present 
his side of the situation to Senate 
on December 2. We met with him 
and found that he is doing some
thing.... I think a lot of this is based 
in a lack of communication, said 
Senderling.
Senderling did concede the need for 
a person in such an important posi
tion to be fully integrated with the 
rest of the organization. Weve both 
asked him to reconsider his time com
mitments, she said. We at Senate 
have all, at one time or another, had 
to assess what we have to do as stu
dents and what we have to do as Sena
tors.
Of his meeting with Krug and 
Senderling, Mueller said, Basically,
I told them about what Ive been doing 
and I guess they feel better about the 
situation.
Many in Senate are not looking to 
remove Mueller from office. Rather, their 
aim is to use the impeachment as a way 
of indicating to the treasurer that, while 
he may feel he is doing his job, Senate 
feels it needs to be done better. Our 
original intention was not to say, Youre 
not doing your job  get out. Were 
trying to light a fire under his butt and 
get things done, said Szudarek.
Bembenick explained that impeach
ment does not mean automatic re
moval from office. Next week will be 
the Bill of Attainder, he said. If it 
passes, he is attainted which, of 
course, means that he has been pro
nounced guilty by Senate and re
moved from office.
Senate by-laws require a quorum 
of three-quarters when the removal 
of an executive committee member 
is being considered. The Bill of At
tainder would have to be approved 
by at least three-quarters of the 
Senators present for it to pass.
The impeachment comes at a deli
cate time for the Senate  next 
Mondays meeting will be the first 
meeting of the new Senate and, as a 
result, the matter of impeachment will 
not be dealt with until all the new 
chairpersons have been elected. The 
present Senate has been dealing with 
internal changes, including negotia
tions with representatives from the 
Graduate Student Organization, who 
want to form an autonomous body for 
graduate students.
Theres been a lot of shake-up in 
Senate and we wanted to clean house 
before moving onto important stuff 
[The issue of impeachment] came up 
tonight because we were discussing 
the budget, said Szudarek, explain
ing why Muellers performance as trea
surer was not evaluated earlier in the 
semester.
I feel I have been doing my job but 
I can understand people being irri
tated by me because there hasnt been 
that communication link  what Ive 
been doing hasnt been disseminated 
to Senate [sic], said Mueller. I dont 
think it would serve any purpose to 
blow up about it.
CMU hosts Russian professor
RUSSIA, from page 1
from California and Africa, said Safirov. He added, 
though, that the Russian economy declined when 
this change occurred because when the market 
was declared free, meaning that anyone could 
own businesses, prices skyrocketed from twenty 
to a thousand times. The inflation slowly de
creased from the years 1992 through 1995, and 
finally this year the inflation diminished.
Now there is an abundance of food and con
sumer goods all over the country, Safirov said.
He also explained that changes were being 
made in the ruling party. In 1991, for the first 
time in Russian history, the president was elected 
by popular election. Now the Russian parlia
ment contains several portions, many of which 
correspond to sections of the American parlia
ment, like the Russian constitutional court, which 
corresponds to the American judicial court, and 
the Russian Senate, just to name a few.
Because of these factors, Safirov claims that 
Russia and America have many things in com
mon and therefore can help each other.
I think we should be optimistic because Rus
sia is a big country, he said. Because it is 
currently in a transitional stage from a com
mand economy to a free market economy,We 
need everything in Russia, Safirov said. He 
claims that Russia is on a good track. Although 
the last ten years have been very important to 
the Russian Federations development, Safirov 
said that ten years of history is a drop in a 
bucket, [and we] are still not sure what will 
happen in the next few decades.

Former CMU dean receives SRC award
The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) 
has selected Professor Stephen W. Director, dean 
of the College of Engineering at the University of 
Michigan, and former Dean of CIT at Carnegie 
Mellon, as the first recipient of its Aristotle Award.
The award acknowledges teaching excellence, 
demonstrated by faculty advising graduate stu
dents and guiding SRC-funded research at univer
sities throughout the United States and in Canada.
In nominating letters for the new award, former 
students praised Director as an exceptional re
searcher and teacher who has fostered the careers 
of dozens of graduate students now working in the 
semiconductor industry.
Director has participated in SRC-funded research 
since 1982, when he was named director of the SRC 
Center of Excellence in Computer-Aided Design at 
Carnegie Mellon University. He served as dean of 
Engineering at CMU from 1991 until earlier this year. 
This past September, Director was named dean of the 
College of Engineering at the University of Michigan,
The SRC, based in Research Triangle Park, NC, 
is a consortium of more than 60 semiconductor 
industry companies and government agencies. It 
plays a crucial role in planning, directing, and 
funding an integrated program of applied research 
in all areas of semiconductor design and manufac
ture. The SRC has invested and managed more
than $340 million in semiconductor research since 
its formation by the Semiconductor Industry Asso
ciation in 1982. This research is performed at more 
than 50 leading universities and research institu
tions across North America.
ID pictures will be taken at new dates
Photo shootings are still being held in Warner 
Hall 28C. Pictures will be taken November 25-27, 
each day from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, for all under
graduates, graduates students, staff, and faculty.
You must bring your current Carnegie Mellon ID 
card or other photo ID. Your new ID card will be 
mailed in late December.
Beginning in the Spring, your current ID card 
will no longer be valid. If you miss these scheduled 
times, Enrollment Services will continue taking 
ID pictures this semester, but expect additional 
line delays.
For those spouses, partners, and childern that 
have CMU photo IDs, they will be replaced free of

Purnell Center must 
proceed as planned
Early this semester, although it 
was about ten years in coming, the 
University Center building project 
was finally realized. Eagerly antici
pated by the campus community, 
the project met with remarkable suc
cess. This year marks a colossal mile
stone in our universitys history.
The UC, however, was only one of 
CMUs recently undertaken major 
construction efforts. Roberts Hall, 
located behind Hamerschlag Hall, 
approaches completion at a healthy 
rate, and designs have been final
ized for the Purnell Center for the 
Arts.
In its first phase of its construc
tion, the Center will occupy the space 
in front of the Navy Building, next to 
Warner Hall. Eventually, it will mir
ror the UC across the cut, wrapping 
around Warner Hall on both sides.
However, just as planning has be
gun, so has procrastination  
ground-breaking was supposed to 
have started this fall. Although final 
architectural drawings have been or
dered and the Center appears on 
officially published campus maps and 
PR documents, any progressive ac
tion oriented towards actually initi
ating its construction as of yet re
mains unrealized.
What many do not realize about 
the Purnell Center is that it isnt 
simply a nice place to go to see a 
show. Instead, it is a facility greatly 
needed by fine arts students and 
faculty.
Currently, CFAis decentralized as 
a college. The departments of Music, 
Drama, Design, and Architecture 
have all acquired or utilized spaces 
in other buildings, occasionally out
side the University: Margaret 
Morrison, Doherty Hall, the Navy 
Building, Mellon Institute, 
Carnegie Music Hall, and Carlowe 
and Pitt facilities, to name a few. 
Students legitimately complain 
that their department does not 
provide adequate facilities for 
them. To exacerbate the problem, 
as each department admits more 
students, the spaces allocated to 
accommodate them do not parallel 
that increase. When left unac
knowledged, concerns like these 
seriously damage the satisfaction 
of the students and the quality of 
their educations, not to mention 
the reputations of their respective 
departments. Whenever an incon
sistent correlation exists between 
highly ranked departments and the 
facilities representative of their sta
tus, the University as a whole suf
fers. Although direct actions have 
been taken to alleviate this specific 
problem in certain departments, 
such as proposed temporary prac
tice rooms for Music majors, the 
solutions can only be described as 
temporary.
Construction of the Purnell Cen
ter must progress on schedule. 
Based on the success of the UC, the 
administrations new top priority 
should be the completion of the 
new building. They have no reason 
to suspect that Purnells construc
tion couldnt upstage the two year 
benchmark setbytheUC. If delays 
continue, however, history demon
strates that Purnell will be a fu
ture addition for another ten years, 
as was the UC.
No one needs that.
Campus requires 
improved signage
Carnegie Mellon has been working 
on its master plan to beautify the 
campus for decades. What seems to 
have been left out of the plan is a 
provision for a comprehensive, uni
form signage system. It is obvious 
that there are not enough directional 
signs on campus to allow people who 
are at CMU for their first time to find 
the buildings.
With the excellent design program 
at CMU, there certainly exists the 
talent needed to design and imple
ment a complete system of way-finding signs, and a group of eight Com
munication Design students calling 
themselves the Senior Signage 
Team have undertaken this task. 
The problem that remains is that the 
administration has not given them 
the permission or resources they 
need. The administration must let 
them implement their design so we 
can all figure out exactly where we 
are going.
The only signs of this nature that 
currently exist are green makeshift 
signs like the one found in front of 
the Alumni house. This system of 
signs was originally setup to facili
tate deliveries. These signs have be
come the de facto signage system for 
the campus, like a band-aid across 
the directional communication prob
lem. These green signs have thus 
been placed in a few other locations, 
but they are not a comprehensive 
solution.
The problem of a complete signage 
system has only been exacerbated by 
the opening of the UC  there are 
many different rooms in the building 
with many different, non-descriptive 
names, and most of them ending in 
Hall. Visitors to campus frequently 
look for the building Rangos Hall, 
thinking it is a building rather than 
a ballroom. A signage system would 
alleviate this type of confusion.
It seems that before any major

Letter to 
the Editor
1 SB3 Editor:
It was a great feel
ing to read the head
line in the Living sec
tion of The Tartan 
which read Students 
Reach to Spiritual Resources (Novem
ber 4, 1996). The photo, too, was very 
attractive and pleasing to see in the 
school newspaper. It really caught my 
attention. But as I read the article, I 
became more and more disappointed at 
the obvious bias towards mainstream 
Christian groups.
There was no mention of the Roman 
Catholic Newman Center, the Lutheran 
University Center, Shadyside Presbyte
rian, the Orthodox Christian Fellow
ship, the Baptist Campus Ministry, the 
United Methodist Church, or the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 
commonly called the Mormon Church.
All of these are members of the 
Carnegie Mellon University Interfaith 
Council. Even though many students in 
each of these groups are active and are 
involved in their religious programs, I 
am quite sure that there are students in 
these faiths who are unaware of the 
presence of these groups on campus. In 
my opinion, it would have been very 
proper to have included a broader spec
trum of diverstiy. I would deeply appre
ciate knowing the criteria used in the 
selection of the identified groups. Was it
pure bias or possibly ignorance thatthese 
other groups exist?

Editor:
I am surprised that 
James Stepanek 
would advance such a 
simple-minded argu
ment for privatizing 
Social Security (So
cial Security Serves Citizens sans Effi
ciency, The Tartan, 11/8/96).
That another country has privatized 
its Social Security system (incidentally, 
Mr. Stepanek does not establish a causal 
link between social security reform and 
economic growth in Chile) does not auto
matically mean that the United States 
should do so.
Social Security is no different from a 
typical pension plan: employee and em
ployer contributions fund payments to 
retirees, and any surpluses are invested. 
Social Securitys impending bankruptcy 
is not exceptional: due to actuarial er
rors, many public and private-sector 
pension plans also have significant un
funded liabilities.
Replacing Social Security with invest
ments would be a bigger step than Mr. 
Stepanek admits.
Social Security is a defined benefit 
program whereas individual retirement
investment programs are defined cori 
tribution programs. The difference is 
that Social Security benefits depend on 
years of employment, income level while 
employed, disability status, and total 
retirement from other sources.
Benefits from defined contribution 
programs, on the other hand, depend 
directly on contributions on investment 
returns. Carnegie Mellon graduates can 
expect to work for organizations with 
generous defined benefit pension plans. 
Many other Americans do not have ac
cess to such plans.
Carnegie Mellon graduates can ; 
expect to work for organizations with 
optional retirement investments pi 
(e.g. 401 (k)). Many other Americans do 
not have access to such plans, and would 
not have surplus income to contribute in 
the first place.
All working Americans can contribute 
(relatively small amounts) to Individual 
Retirement Accounts, but once again, 
many do not have surplus income to 
contribute to the cause.
Given these basic inequities in the 
American retirement system, Social Se
curity must be preserved.
This would mean increasing premi
ums and making better investments to 
restore the plans actuarial soundness:

contribution ceiling  all those people

the unfortunate job of trying to 
install temporary signage. The

Weekend coordinators have to 
make and post directional signs for 
every program weekend  a pro
cess that is both laborious and in
effective. This is a task that should 
not have to be repeated.
Before visitors can even try to 
find their way around campus, they 
have to find the campus. This can 
be difficult because there isnt a 
highly visible sign on Forbes Av
enue that indicates that you are at 
CMU, to begin with, aside from a 
dark, hidden, and difficult to see 
sign on the wall between Forbes 
and Warner Hall. As part of this 
new signage system, the Senior 
Signage Team and the administra
tion should consider erecting an 
arch across Forbes avenue similar 
in function to Duquesne 
Universitys Arch, but with a form 
that communicates the image of 
Carnegie Mellon.
The signage system could help 
solve a few other problems on cam
pus as well. The CMU community 
produces countless eight-and-ahalf-by-eleven, laser-printed, 
homemade signs everyday. These 
signs seldom have any communi
cation value, and are usually a 
mess. A signage system could in
clude a uniform template for mak
ing these quick-and-easy signs.
The Carnegie Mellon campus 
has grown considerably over the 
last several decades. It has ma
tured to a fairly attractive, archi
tecturally diverse, and storied 
environment. A comprehensive 
and uniform signage system would 
complement the environment 
while helping its inhabitants and 
visitors better appreciate and 
navigate throughout it.

Where I come from, people riot when a 
white cop is acquitted of assaulting a black 
criminal. When I heard that John Vojtas was 
acquitted, I asked all my friends if they wanted Rodney King.
them announce the verdict (and get my riot 
gear together), and I was thrilled to no end 
when they said he was innocent. Surely all 
those people who wanted to see him rot in jail 
would start at least some small riots over this.
But no. There was nothing. Not even in L.A. 
The cops there had set up barricades and 
brought in the national guard, in case riots 
did start. But they didnt! People stayed at 
home and grumbled. What an anti-climax!
Jonny Gammage became Pittsburghs
to go downtown with me to loot and pillage. It 
would be fun! We could drag truck drivers into 
the street and throw sinks at them. We could 
get all the free TVs, stereos, and laserdisc 
players we could ever want!
No, they said, but they were going to 
stand in front of the city court
house to protest, and 
asked me to 
join them.
Their ap
proach to the 
situation was 
so reasonable 
and logical, I 
was baffled.
Actually, 
during my 
tenure in 
Pittsburgh, 
the closest 
the citys 
come to riot
ing was when 
the Steelers 
were in the 
Super Bowl.
I was afraid 
to go out on 
the streets; 
drunken foot
ball fans were 
driving 
around wav
ing their Ter
rible Towels 
and scream
ing, Go 
Stiller s! 
They scared 
me.
But even 
then nothing 
got violent.
And Im not 
talking about 
violence for 
the sake of a 
cause or an 
ideal, like in 
Braveheart or Home 
Alone. I mean violence 
for its own sake. I mean, 
seriously, were all those people loot
ing in South Central because they were out
raged over what they thought was an unfair 
verdict from a possibly racist jury?
Of course not! They wanted big-screen TVs! 
They wanted portable CD players! They 
wanted massage chairs from Brookstone and 
otherwise-fantastically expensive electric tie 
racks from The Sharper Image.
And frankly, Im jealous. So I was rooting 
for Vojtass acquittalnot because I thought 
he was innocent, but because I wanted to steal 
that big, six-and-a-half-foot, $3000 dollar, H.R. 
Giger alien thing from The Sharper Image. 
But then I got my wish, and nobody looted! 
Instead they protested peacefully. And I 
couldnt very well start looting all by myself 
and hope that others would catch on. I dont 
have the guts for that.
It was the same situation with the O.J. 
Simpson verdict. I ditched a class to watch
In fact, it was even more serious than Rodney 
King  Gammage died. But the city didnt
milk this opportunity for everything it was 
worth.
People might say Los Angeles is superficial 
and materialistic, but I say, these other cities 
can learn from L.A. If you want to accomplish 
something, dont walk around with picket 
signs outside the building which houses the 
people who have the power to change things. 
Thatll never get you anywhere.
Instead, beat up innocent bystanders and 
steal a bunch of video cameras.
To hell with ideals! Forget about reason! 
Who needs peaceful protest?! Lets just go out 
and plunder the city!

actually quite peaceful, in real life. He was

James Stepanek
Not that I imagine anyone 
missed it, but have you noticed 
that there is a real double stan
dard out there? No, Im not going 
to go on about affirmative action 
again. Im going to discuss the 
subject of sexual harassment, and 
how Bill Clinton can somehow 
get away with a blatant case of it
while everyone else gets crucified.
The story is as follows: then-governor of Arkansas Clinton saw Paula 
Jones, a women whom he found appealing, sent one of his state police 
bodyguards on duty to protect him to collect her, and then (according to 
the lawsuit filed by Jones) waved his tallywhacker in her face and 
requested oral sex.
After she refused, he made veiled threats that she should keep quiet, 
since he was the governor and she was a staite employee. Now I dont know 
about you, but this seems like a pretty clear case of harassment to me.
Jones brought the lawsuit because the state trooper who escorted her 
up there had made a claim that she had fooled around with the governor 
(even though he wasnt actually present for the act), and she wanted to 
clear her name.
She initially just wanted an apology from Clinton. However, now that 
the media has dragged her name through the mud it wont be that simple.
In defending the President, the Clintonites have gone with a variety of 
defenses, including inter alia, claiming that nothing of the sort ever 
happened, describing Ms. Jones as white trash, saying everything is 
just a GOP plot (some notable figures on the right have been helping with 
her court expenses), and simply dismissing the case as spurious.
Of course I would have to point out that if the case is so feeble, why has 
the Clinton team gone to such great lengths to keep it from going to court?
If its that weak, then winning in court should be a trivial matter, 
certainly less trouble than having the matter hanging over Clintons head 
for the remainder of his term.
That appears not to be the case because of the wide variety of legal 
maneuvers which the Clinton team has employed has been pretty amaz
ing.
They have tried just about every trick in the book all the way to using 
a law that protects military commanders from civil suits. The concept of 
Clinton as a military commander is well past the point of offensive and 
far along into the realm of the ludicrous.
The issue of whether or not the civil suit will be postponed until he is out 
of office goes before the Supreme Court in January. It should be an 
interesting case to watch, since all the lower courts have decided that it 
should proceed.
If, in fact, it does proceed, analysis in The American Lawyer (not a right 
wing journal, needless to say), actually stated that the case was pretty 
strong. It was described as much stronger than the case against Clarence 
Thomas which had feminists in such an uproar.
What has been the response from feminists to all this deft legal evasion 
of serious charges of harassment by Clinton? Well, um, nothing whatso
ever. Pure hypocrisy at its best. Feminists have simply jumped on the boat 
and claimed that Jones is just a piece of white trash and is making up the 
story. They allude to her pictures that appeared in Playboy (against her 
will  they had been taken by an ex-boyfriend) as evidence that she was 
a tramp. How about that? For once the feminists have a use for pictures 
that appeared in Playboy, especially ones printed without the womans 
consent.
To further display the level of hypocrisy evinced on this issue by 
members of the left, we will look at a case being prosecuted by the Clinton 
justice department.
Currently a judge from western Tennessee, David Lanier, has been 
charged with harassment. He exposed his genitals to a woman and asked 
her to perform oral sex. Sound familiar? He was found guilty in a lower 
court, and yet won his appeal. So what did the justice department do? 
Theyve taken it to the Supreme Court.
This should be a funny court season in which we have a President trying 
to have the court let him dodge a set of charges that an agency under his 
control is prosecuting to the hilt in another case.
All of this is merely par for the course for Bill Clinton. As weve seen on 
almost every other issue, in the eyes of the media and the rest of the left, 
Clinton can do no wrong. He botches important foreign policy matters, 
and its dismissed as not his fault.
He illegally amasses a horde of private files, and everyone accepts that 
it was just a mistake.
He backs a host of measures restricting the rights of individual citizens 
and tries to expand the police powers of the federal government, and his 
enemies are labelled the fascists.
He is alleged to have blatantly sexually harassed a woman, and her tale 
is dismissed as nothing because she is white trash. Doesnt anyone on 
the left have a shred of integrity anymore?
Id say its pretty apparent that they do not, or else they are not allowed 
to speak. It might not be good for their cause, but that is at the expense 
of decency.

would be working hard for a win 
in Pittsburgh the next weekend 
against Pitt.
Saturday night, back in their 
home rink, CMU looked like a 
team reborn. University of Pitts
burgh is CMUs oldest rival. Pitt 
has not beaten CMU since No
vember of 1991. Last year, CMU 
beat Pitt in the fall in the most 
physical game played all season. 
The squad then tied Pitt in the 
spring in another wild ride.
Fans packed the stands at 
Neville. They taunted the Pitt 
captains. They taunted the Pitt 
goaltender. The taunting worked. 
It drove Pitt crazy and it drove 
CMU to score.
Both teams came out hard hit
ting. For the first eight minutes 
they circled each other, getting in 
shots and muscling each other in 
the corners. Ivanovic was all over 
the ice, controlling the puck bril
liantly while crushing the oppo
sition on the fore-check. When 
the first line finally got some space 
in front of the net, Buck took off 
towards the Pitt goal, sending to 
puck to Fitzgerald who controlled 
it to the left of the goaltender, 
waiting for Adukaitis to come 
down and position himself in 
front. Fitzgeralds perfect pass 
was flipped over the goalie by 
Adukaitis, who celebrated furi
ously as the score went up 1-0, 
CMU. It stood that way for the 
remainder of the period. CMU 
continued their strong play with 
Buck playing a great defensive 
game, clearing the puck out of 
the zone repeatedly in penalty 
killing situations.
The second brought on more of 
the same. Early on, a Pitt trip
ping call gave CMU the advanpass and flip it up into the net.
Rookie forward Rio Ota and 
defenseman P.J. Grzywacz
much hopeless, as are Tampa 
Bay, New York, St. Louis, and 
Arizona.
Philadelphia: So Ty Detmer 
is not Ron Jaworski. Is that 
really a bad thing? Rickey 
Watters should shut up and 
play, otherwise Ray Rhodes 
may severely hurt him. The 
Eagles are good enough to win 
their division; they arent good 
enough to win in the playoffs.
Detroit: Dont you think that 
Wayne Fontes would have fig
ured out by now that the key for 
his team winning is handing 
off the ball to Barry Sanders 30 
times a game? If he figures this 
out soon, he might save his job. 
The Lions always find some way 
to get into the playoffs.
Green Bay: They would be 
the odds-on favorites if they 
had some wide receivers, but 
they dont and Andre Rison 
doesnt count. It would be nice 
if they could get Edgar 
Bennett and the running 
game going, but that doesnt 
seem likely. Watch the Pack
ers dreams die again.
Minnesota: No Warren 
Moon means no playoffs and 
probably means Lou Holtz next 
year in the Metrodome.
Carolina: Very little of
fense. Very good defense. 
Circle the last game of the 
season on your calendar. The 
Steelers travel to Carolina. If 
the game means something 
for both teams, expect more 
blitzing than a World War II 
raid. Two years for an expan
sion team to reach the play
offs is mighty impressive.
San Francisco: This year, 
the 49ers have won games with 
three different quarterbacks at 
the helm. So, why does it mat
ter that Steve Young is severely 
battered. Well, neither Elvis 
Grbac, nor Jeff Brohm knows 
what the pressure of an NFC 
championship game is like. If 
Young is hurt, the 49ers are not 
going anywhere.Washington: The Redskins 
started off well, but they knew 
it would soon end. They still 
have to see the Cowboys twice 
including a very fun Thanks
giving game. Terry Allen should 
win Comeback Player of the 
Decade for what hes done.

and the offense really misses

8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  25 November 1996
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
I didnt intend to spend an
other column on the plight of 
the Penguins, but three trades 
in less than a week deserves 
some reporting. Craig Patricks 
shopping spree began on No
vember 17 when he unloaded 
unsigned center Bryan 
Smolinski to the New York Is
landers for defenseman Darius 
Kasparaitis, who was a major
PHaumn wufrnlonm Tlo
thorn in the Pens side in the 
1992 playoffs, and winger 
Andreas Johansson. After a day 
of rest, Patrick continued to re
vamp his basement team by trad
ing farmhand Chris Wells to the 
Florida Panthers for center Stu 
Barnes and another defense
man, Jason Wooley. In another 
move the same day, the Pens 
sent defenseman Dmitri 
Mironov and goon ' (I mean 
winger) Shawn Antoski to the 
equally struggling Mighty Ducks 
of Anaheim for yet another 
blueliner, Fredrik Olausson, and 
center Alex Hicks. In order to 
make room on the roster for the 
newcomers, the Pens opted to 
put veterans Petr Klima and Dan 
Quinn on waivers.
In two games, Kasparaitis has 
made his presence felt. He scored 
an empty-net goal on 
Tuesday night, 
and added an 
assist Thurs
day night. 
Kaspar also 
picked 5' a 
boarding pen
alty for a cheap check from be
hind on former teammate Pierre 
Turgeon. With play like this, 
hes liable to become a fan favor
ite much like Ulf Samuelsson, 
who also played with a lack of 
sportsmanship. From the 
Smolinski deal, I was 
more impressed with 
Johansson than the dirty 
Russian. Johansson 
came out flying against 
9uIvpHoul the Blues and obviously
was trying to impress the fans 
and coach Eddie Johnston.
While I have not seen the 
former Panthers and Ducks in 
their new uniforms, I saw that 
both blueliners, Wooley and 
Olausson, picked up assists in 
another road loss Thursday 
night. I was surprised that 
Patrick could acquire Wooley 
and Barnes for Wells  a highly 
touted prospect who has yet to 
display NHL caliber skills. 
Mironov and Antoski wont be 
missed, but Hicks and Olausson 
arent very appealing either. Im 
predicting that neither of them
will play a full season in a Pen
guins uniform.
Overall, Im pleased with the 
trades. Im sad to see Smolinski 
go, but if he had to go, Im glad 
hes on Long Island where he 
will have more of a chance to 
shine. The most disappointing 
factor in this rash of moves that 
probably made Mike Keenan 
blush is the loss of Petr Klima. 
This Czech has been one of my 
favorites since his drunken days 
in Detroit.
I dont think he was given a 
chance to settle yet  even

spot on the roster. I think Jheie 
is more dead wood in the likes of

for a quick fix with these moves, 
which will hopefully pay off for

Guru picks Dallas, Denver in Super Bowl
From the Goal Line
by Ronak Singhal
So this is the last column until the 
Super Bowl. On the first day of classes 
next semester, the talk of the hallways 
will be of what class you have, what class 
youre dropping, and who won the two 
conference championship games the day 
before. Here is a description of the chance 
each of the 30 teams has of dancing on 
Bourbon Street come January:
AFC
You can forget about the Jets, Ravens, 
Raiders, Jaguars, Bengals, and 
Seahawks. Each team has something 
positive going for it (well, that is, except 
for the Jets), but they just dont have the 
overall team balance needed to advance 
to the playoffs.
Indianapolis: Jim Harbaugh needs to 
find some of the magic he had last year. 
Marshall Faulk needs to just find himself. 
Faulk has virtually disappeared this sea
son. Thats bad. Theres still time for them 
to turn it around, but I think its too little 
too late for the Colts.
San Diego: Another injury-plagued 
team. If they had a running game, Id give 
them a shot at even making the Super 
Bowl. Unfortunately, they dont have a 
running game, so they wont even be mak
ing the playoffs.
Miami: So, what will be the end result 
in the beginning of the Jimmy Johnson 
era? Its still too hard to say how good, bad, 
or mediocre this team really is. Theyll 
make the playoffs ... and then lose in the 
first round.
New England: When Bledsoe is hot 
and Curtis Martin is moving the ball, this 
team is tough to play, but Denver showed 
that they can also be manhandled. After 
the first round of playoffs, Bill Parcells 
gets to go home.
Kansas City: KC has been playing 
very well of late  wait until January 
when the real games start. The Chiefs 
have one of the best records in football
over the last ten years 
and absolutely noth
ing to show.for it. That 
trend is not going to 
end this year.
Buffalo: After a 
slow start, Jim Kelly 
has been playing well 
of late. And veterans 
like Thurman Tho
mas and Bruce 
Smith are leading 
their respective units 
like it was the early 
90s. And like the early 
90s, the Bills will end 
their season with a loss. 
This year it will be in ei
ther Pittsburgh or Denver.
Pittsburgh: The Steelers 
are my kind of team. They 
run, run, run and then beat 
you with the 
pass. Their 
defense is 
as hard-hit
ting as any 
around and 
already has 
scored five touchdowns 
this season. Thats incred
ible. They also have Jerome Bettis w^0 
may be the premier running back in % 
AFC right now. Unfortunately, this teain 
has shown no ability to win on the road 
and they cant rely on their passing 
game for late-game comebacks 
like they could last year. This 
team is good, but probably 
not good enough.
Denver: Elway, Davis, and 
Sharpe are the best offensive 
trio in the NFL this year. Tl^e 
defense has grown up fast, and 
they can beat you by running 
through you, throwing over you, or a 
combination of the two. The Bron
cos are not indestructible, and regu
lar season means nothing once the 
playoffs start. Expect Pittsburgh 
and Denver to collide in Mile High 
to settle the AFC. Broncos win if the 
weather is nice, but ifit starts snow
ing, nothing can stop Bettis, so take 
the Steelers.
NFC
I dont like the NFC. I dont like the 
American League or the. designated 
hitter either. In fact, there are many 
things I dont like. (Just thought I-d

CMU drops match to W&J
BASKETBALL, from page 10
^Bodnar led the CMU scoring effort, tallying 19 
"points. He was helped by Praesels 17 points and 
junior forward Andy Sofishs 16 points. Sofish, 
Bodnar, and senior center Gary Trendal led the 
team in rebounds, pulling down six boards apiece.
The W&J match-up was a disappointing loss for 
the Tartans. We didnt deserve to win, said Wingen. 
it was a very disappointing performance.
The Tartans came off the bench strong, tak
ing an early six-point lead. This lead vanished, 
however, as the W&J defense hammered the 
CMU team, giving the Tartans a six minute dry 
spell in which they scored no points. During 
^this time, W&J racked up an 11 point lead,
which carried to the half, 3322.
In the second half, the Tartans again played 
aggressively, chipping away at W&Js lead. CMITs 
drive gave the team a six point lead with less than 
five minutes on the clock. Then, the Tartans began 
to fall apart, allowing W&J close the gap. We made 
some costly turnovers, said Wingen. [And had] 
some mental breakdowns on defense, too. Wingen 
also said, They really hurt us with dribble penetra
tion all night long, but especially at the end of the 
game. W&J took the lead and the game with a field 
goal with eight seconds remaining on the clock.
Wingen said, We need to understand that we 
cant have mental breakdowns, and we have to 
execute in order to win.Crew prepares for spring season
By JASON SCHARFMAN
, Tartan Junior Staffwriter
W ere going to work hard over 
, the winter and come out strong 
in the spring, said CMU crew 
coach Casa Hadley. Rowing in 
three races so far this yearthe 
Head of the Ohio, Head of the 
Speakmon and the Oscoghun, 
the team has met with some suc
cess. With a variety of teams 
: competingfrom the womens 
varsity team to the mens nov
ice team  each, according to 
Casa, has shown considerable 
improvement.
Members of the crew team, a 
club sport here at CMU, can row 
one of two kinds of boats  a 
sweep or a scull boat. In a sweep 
boat, each rower only has one 
oar, while in a scull boat each 
person has two. Sweeps can carry 
eight, four or two people. Sculls 
on the other hand can carry four, 
. two or even just one person. How
ever these numbers are a bit mis
leading because in the larger 
boats, a larger person, called a 
coxswain, sits at the bow of the 
boat. The job ofthe coxswainis to 
yell the technical commands at 
the rowers.
The novice team, which con
sists of first-year college rowers, 
competed together for the first 
time this year in the Head of the 
Speakmon. According to novice 
team member JasonKatcoff, We 
did considerably well, consider
ing it was our first race together. 
The womens varsity team also 
did quite well as they placed 
third, under the leadership of 
Amanda Taul, to receive a bronze 
medal. The mens varsity team 
placed fifth.
Looking forward to the winter 
months for training, Hadley said, 
I think it will really help us to 
stay in shape. As well as 
weightlifting, the team also is 
going to compete in a number of
erg races. Erging, which is basi
cally just rowing on an indoor 
rowing machine, according to 
novice rower Jason Katcoff, 
helps to improve technique and 
keep your cardiovascular sys
tem in shape. With most erg 
races lasting 2,000 meters, 
Hadley also feels that these 
races help to promote team 
spirit and keep the team going.
The team is looking forward 
to the biggest race of the year
 the Dadvaile in the spring 
season. CMU will face such 
teams as Marietta, Loyola, Vir
ginia Tech and the University of 
Pittsburgh. Although some 
tougher competitors such as 
Harvard will also be there, 
Hadley feels that the team can 
still remain competitive and 
has a chance to do well.
Anyone interested in joining 
the crew team should contact 
Casa Hadley at 421-ROWS.
IM Department crowns soccer champs
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The annual intramural soccer championships 
were held this past Thursday evening at Gesling 
Stadium, and three teams walked away with 
division championships.
In theMajors championships, Real Mellon 
faced off against SAE. Real Mellon dominated 
the match, giving SAE little chance to put to
gether a significant scoring push. Real Mellons 
John Stivoric scored first, followed by another 
goal by Astro Teller. Then, Eugene Chang put 
the only SAE goal of the game past the Real 
Mellon goalie to end the half. In the second half, 
Real Mellon came out with a vengeance, scoring 
four unanswered goals  Chris Kasabach and 
Jovan Popovic each scored once, and Teller 
scored twice. Real Mellon has won four of the 
last six Majors soccer titiles.
PKT Brazil and the DU Mighty Mamaus
battled it out for the Intermediate soccer title. 
Both teams began the game defensively, but 
DUs Freddy Varela beat goalie Matt Chen to 
start the Mighty Mamaus scoring frenzy. PKT 
almost tied the match when a crossing shot by 
Nick Moons just missed the far post. DU scored 
again in the final minute of the first half on a goal 
by Matt Schwartz. DU continued scoring in the 
second half as Varela put another ball into the 
back of the net. Varela finished the scoring with 
a final goal to wrap up the game MVP.
In the Womens division, it was a varsity team 
showdown as the basketball teams Tartan 
Hoopers took on the volleyball teams Flying Os. 
The Os started the scoring with a goal by Jen 
Sutherland early in the half. A direct kick by the 
Hooperss Michelle Cook crossed the goal line to 
tie up the game before halftime. The Os Sarah 
Putaro put away the winning goal off of a throwin by Patty Bruno. This is the Os second season 
as champions.
A SUITE FOR LESS

NBA scoring angers fan
The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
You saw them every summer in 
the movies. Youve seen some on 
TV. Now you can see it 41 times a 
year, in select cities, LIVE! 
Straight from the NBA, were 
bringing the conspiracy theory 
direct to you. If there is a team in 
your area, you too can see offi
cials, coaches, and players in ca
hoots to keep the score down and 
your excitement to a minimum.
Observe as the scrutinizing eyes 
of the worlds top referees catch 
the slightest infraction by the of
fense and miss defensive fouls 
entirely! See the wily coach shift to 
the no-offense line-up to preserve 
the win. Watch as societys great
est examples of strength, skill, and 
stamina stumble, trip, and fall all 
over themselves and others in their 
paltry attempts to put a little ball 
in an orange round hoop.
Its a secret, as closely guarded 
as the UFO in Area 51, but Ive 
figured it out. Who wants to run 
up and down the court scoring all 
those points? The fewer the 
points, the greater the share of 
loafing. Players and refs arent 
dumb you know.
They dont deserve all the credit. 
The coaches approved. Now they 
can say Look boss, I kept them 
under 100 again! As soon as we get 
a Grant Hill in next years draft, 
watch out world!
Ive got it all figured out. The 
NBA is an abbreviation. Its 
just like another abbrevia
tion, JFK, only spelled dif
ferently? Coincidence? I 
dont think so. More proof?
vid-e-o) surveillance, teams can 
analyze every which way the 
opponent scores.
Oh-no, watch out sports-lovers. 
One team refuses to play along. 
Just like that Harrison Ford char
acter in Clear and Present Dan
ger, its those dam Chicago Bulls 
again. Uh-oh! There they go with 
their scoring again.
Not only are they leading the 
league with 104.7 points a game 
(how do you get .7 points in a 
game?) theyre tops in offensive 
field goal percentage (48.2) and 
lowest in turnovers. Their league 
best defensive shooting percent
age (39.7) and defensive free 
throw percentage (66.7) are bla
tant transgressions against the 
standards that the rest of the 
league is setting.
On top of that, theyre cheating. 
They get more rebounds and as
sists than anyone else. Arent there 
rules against passingthe ball help
ing your teammates out?
I can prove theyre cheat
ing. So far, theyve failed to 
do two things that every other 
team in the league has done. 
Every other team has made some 
change to its starting lineup from 
the end of last season and every 
other team has lost a game.
Next thing you know, theyll 
break the pattern of every other 
NBA team ever. They wont 
lose a game! Dirty Bulls.

Discover the ever-decreasing 
shooting percentage. This year 
its down to 44 percent, lower 
than I can ever remember it be
ing. Those crazy players, they 
couldnt even spell hoop if you 
spotted them an H, a P, and one 
O. How low can it go folks?
The coaches wage an intense 
chessmatch during the games. 
Theyll counter each others deci
sions, move for move. What would 
you diehards at home do: put in 
the defensive specialist or your 
defensive extra-specialist?
Learn to discern the differ

CMU swim teams split Elizabethtown meet
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Staffwriter
When the womens 100-yard 
breaststroke began, the CMU 
womens swim team stood 87 
82 over Elizabethtown College 
at the November 24 dual meet.
But two events later, the meet 
was over and the womens team 
had suffered another barelythere defeat, losing 104-101 and 
turning its record to 2-4. The 
CMU mens team easily de
feated Elizabethtown 12474, 
leaving the team with an unde
feated 6-0 record halfway 
through the season.
Despite the fact that the CMU 
women lost, the swimmers 
depth carried the team to the 
close score. This was the kind 
of meet you want, said head 
coach David Belowich. The 
women were all a little tense 
and pretty psyched up; thats 
what swimming is all about. 
The team swam very well as a
whole. Notably, CMU captured 
a 1-2 victory over Elizabethtown 
in the 1,000-yard freestyle and in 
the 100-yard butterfly, and a se
ries of 2-3 wins in the 200-yard 
individual medley, 100-yard 
breaststroke, and the 200-yard 
freestyle relay.
The mens team showed as 
strong as it has been all season. 
In addition to its 50-point win 
over Elizabethtown, junior Jake 
McGuire smashed a 10-year old 
school record in the 50-yard
freestyle. The former record of 
21.59, set in 1986 by Steve 
Francis, fell to McGuires time 
of 21.55.
Im really excited about the 
swim, said McGuire. Its just 
the middle of November right 
now, and if this is where I am, I 
have a really good outlook for 
the end of the season. McGuire 
is also a part of the mens 200- 
yard freestyle relay, which won 
the event with a 1:29.15. We 
have to swim just a little faster,
maybe by a couple of tenths of 
seconds for each of us, but over
all, the relay should do well this 
season, McGuire added.
With the season half over, the 
team will be traveling to Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida for its win
ter training session. Over the 
break, it will swim in both a 
dual meet against Johns 
Hopkins University and an in
vitational meet. Well be look
ing to improve both speed and 
technique, said Belowich. We
want to improve the speed 
through the back half of the 
races, and increase technique 
all around, which should in
crease the speed in the first 
half of the races.
Belowich is really good, said 
McGuire. His weight training 
program is responsible for 90 
percent of the increases in speed 
that weve seen.
The teams first meet next se
mester is away against Colum
bia on January 17.
Womens basketball dominates Thiel
By KEVIN KROEN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The womens team started 
off strong Friday night when 
they defeated Thiel College 
70-48 in front of over 400 
fans in the Skibo Gymnasium 
in the opening round of the 
Carnegie Mellon Invita
tional. Leading the way was 
senior forward Penny Davis, 
who scored a career-high 22 
points on a 9-14 field goal 
percentage. In addition, jun
ior guard Marcelle Steele con
tributed 10 points, freshman 
center Samantha Majemik 
contributed nine points, and 
junior forward Katie OLeary 
contributed eight points.
Our team came ready to 
play, said womens coach 
Gerri Seidl. This was evident 
as the Tartans jumped all 
over Thiel early in the game.
The Tartans countered a 
Thiel run which brought the 
score within 11 points at the 
half by making a 13-0 run 
early in the second half.
The story of the game, 
though, was Penny Davis.

while Thiel shot 57 percent on only 14

Carnegie Mellon advanced on to play 
Mount Union in the finals of the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational Tourna
ment. The Lady Tartans were not so 
lucky in their quest for a tournament 
championship in the finals against 
Mount Union as they dropped the game 
8156. The game had a rough start, as
experience for the Tartans though, and 
this should help them out in later games. 
It was a good game to play early on in 
our season, said Seidl. She also said, 
Im proud. Were going to get better 
every practice.

out, this was an impressive game 
for the Tartans considering the fact 
that they played a team that was 
ranked second in the nation last 
year and still appears to be domi
nant. Seidl, upbeat after the game, 
said, We got to play an excellent 
team. Im not disappointed. Lead
ing the way in this game was fresh
man guard Lacey Perretta, who 
scored 15 points and grabbed six 
rebounds. Other significant con
tributors were OLeary, who grabbed11 rebounds and scored six points,
Davis with eight points, senior for
ward Kristin Kupfer with eight 
points, and senior guard Tracey 
Coalter who hit two three-pointers 
and scored seven points.
A major problem in this game was 
finding a way to contain the Mount 
Union Purple Warriors. Mount 
Union junior guard Suzy Venet was 
unstoppable, as she scored 31 points 
on her way to winning the tourna
ment MVP. The entire Mount Union 
squad gave the Tartans troubles.
We want to be a running team. We 
wanted to outrun them, said Seidl.
Unfortunately, Mount Union did not 
allow the Tartans to control the 
game. They were extremely ath
letic, said Seidl. This was a good

Men beat 
Grove City
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The mens basketball team launched 
the season this past weekend with a 
pair of on-the-road matches. The Tar
tans defeated Grove City College 67-63 
in overtime on Friday night, followed 
by a last-second loss on Saturday night 
to Washington & Jefferson College.
The first half of the Grove City game 
was fairly uneventful for the Tartan. 
CMU started the game slowly, and the 
action went back-and-forth as the two 
teams fought for control of the game. 
The Tartans ended the half down 28- 
24, commiting 12 turnovers and only 
shooting 30 percent from the field.
The second half started off in much 
the same fashion, as the teams battled 
to dictate the pace of the game. The 
Tartans surged ahead to take the lead 
51-50 with 3:30 remainingin the game. 
GC answered with several points of 
their own  retaking the lead 52-55 
with under a minute left on the clock. 
With only 19 seconds remaining in the 
game, sophomore Tommy Praesel hit a 
three-point shot to tie the score and 
send the game into overtime.
The overtime period was all CMU, 
said head coach Tony Wingen. The Tar

Tartan ice hockey squad falls to hard-skating IUP, Pitt teams
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Staffwritter
On Sunday, November 17, 
Carnegie Mellon faced Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania away 
at Indiana. CMU had beaten two 
interdivisional foes already that 
weekend, Edinboro on Friday and 
Slippery Rock the next night, and 
expected that the momentum 
would charge the team to com
plete the weekend sweep. But the 
Tartan squad was battered, and 
when fatigue finally caught up 
with them, they dropped the game 
to IUP, 42.
The tired legs of the CMU team 
set the pace for the first two peri
ods. The passing by CMU was 
sloppy and the hitting almost non
existent. Grad student and cap
tain Blair Echols was one of the 
only sparks on the team as he 
fought hard in the corners to free 
the puck for the team.
Junior rookie defenseman Dave 
Mitzel performed admirably off 
of the blue line by keeping the 
puck in the zone. But the for
wards could not get their sticks 
on the elusive object for long. IUP 
was tying them up in front, weak
ening their scoring chances, and 
creating turnovers.
CMU managed to outshoot IUP 
16-11 over those first few peri
ods, but were behind 1-0 when 
they took the ice in the third. The 
team knew that they had to keep 
their shifts down to conserve en
ergy and all three lines playheads 
up hockey to keep from letting 
the game slip away.
IUP quickly dampened CMUs 
spirits by scoring one minute in a 
deflected shot that starting 
goaltender Jon Kliegman had no 
time to react to. IUP continued 
their attack by scoring again a 
few minutes later, pushing the 
score up for IUP, 3-0.
With ten minutes left, the team 
started to come alive, the shifts 
shortened, and the defensemen 
picked up speed to the puck and 
to the man. Charged, CMU barraged the IUP goaltender. Senior 
forward Chris Adukaitis slipped 
around the back of the cage to set 
the pass to the waiting fellow 
first liner, senior Jim Buck, who 
scored on the pass. One minute 
later, the second line charged off 
the bench and senior Relja 
Ivanovic skated his way to scor
ing position. In a last ditch to stop 
the surging Tartan, IUP shoved 
sophomore Steve Leonhardt into 
the IUP net just as Ivanovic raised 
his stick to slap the puck in. The 
referees disallowed the goal.
One minute later, IUP 
bounced back from the blister
ing CMU attack to score a break 
away goal that sent the score 
up 4-1 in their favor. But CMU 
was undaunted. Buck, 
Adukaitis, and Fitzgerald 
played hard until the final 
minute of the game. On the 
power play, junior defenseman 
Voulgaris was busy keeping the 
puck in the IUP zone through a 
lot of traffic, when Buck got his 
blade on it and sent it towards 
Adukaitis who scored on the tip,

even got business cards and his

may be wondering what distin
guishes DJ Luv from the thou
sands of people who provide mu
sical entertainment at parties 
and venues around the world. 
While most of his happy custom
ers will tell you its his smile  
apparently the best in Pittsburgh
 its probably the fact that DJ 
Luv is a senior majoring in elec
trical and computer engineering.
Hitesh Soneji assumed the
working pseud
onym of DJ Luv 
during his se
nior year at 
South Fayette 
High School, but 
the story actu
ally started dur
ing his junior 
year because his 
senior buddies 
were too cheap 
to book a real 
DJ. Ive always 
had a decent 
amount of mu
sic so they asked 
me to bring a 
boom box 
along, said 
Soneji.
The humble 
beginnings of 
DJ Luv Enter
tainment are 
pointedly demonstratedinthis 
story. I brought 
along two boom boxes because we 
didnt have a mixer. So, Id play a 
song on one boombox and then 
switch over to the other one, he 
[said. Soneji then went on to pro
vide the music for a number of 
parties and the success of his ini1 tial efforts led to an invitation by 
the Pittsburgh Gujarat Sonnaj to 
DJ their annual Diwali dinner. 
The group offered to rent more 
professional equipment for Soneji 
and, in addition, pay him $50 for 
his efforts. They were too poor to 
get a D J, just like my friends, said 
Soneji. Good thing for DJ Luv.
That night went super-well. Ev
eryone had a blast, said Soneji. 
Tm thinking to myself, That was 
cool. Maybe I should really do this.
While Sonejis business was sus
tained through high-school gigs 
during his senior year, coming to 
Carnegie Mellon allowed his cus
tomer base to grow. Coming to 
CMU really helped out because I 
started to get gigs on campus, 
said Soneji. Every gig we got from 
that point was word-of-mouth, 
which is the best way.
Coming to CMU has also al

and roadies, they do occasionally 
take over on the mic and help D J

I like to see people develop those 
skills. You know, theres that fu

In addition, the other members of

Acclaimed runner suffers illness,

Scott Moore, electrical and computer engineering major and CMU track star made 
a name for himself after suffering a serious illness his freshmen year.
Ponbb
By JOSHUA MERRY
Tartan. Junior Staffwriter
Scott Moores story is not only 
one of victory, but also of persever
ance. A member of the track team 
and fifth year mechanical engineer
ing major, Moore worked himself
It did not have any negative ef
fects, and Moore made a name for 
himself as a runner on campus. For 
most of that time, he always finished 
from first to third for the team and 
always near the top in the races.
However, in his senior year here, 
more problems started to develop.
My best years of running are probably 
ahead of me.  
 Scott Moore, senior electrical and com
puter engineering
up from physical setbacks during 
his junior year to become one of 
CMUs most successful runners. 
Moore was a successful runner in 
high school and had high hopes 
when he arrived at Carnegie 
Mellon.
However, before he got here, he 
had a seizure. The doctors did not 
know what it was, so they per
formed an MRI test on him. The 
results showed that he had a small 
tumor on his brain. They wanted to 
keep track of it, so they did MRI 
scans every six months, through
out his college career, although it 
appeared to be benign.
He started to have more frequent 
seizures and started to feel dizzi
ness. He had to stop running for a 
semester because of these problems. 
The problems increased to a point 
that he was unable to do anything 
physical, and he had to withdraw for 
a semester.
This did not sit well with Scott. I 
made a decision that if I was allright 
after the surgery, I would start run
ning again, he said.
During this time, Moore was inac
tive and gained considerable weight. 
He said, It was nice for the first 
week. I got antsy after that. Scott 
loves running and the sense of com
petition, and so being unable 
to do either was rough for him. 
He finally underwent surgery 
to have the tumor removed. It 
was successful, and he began 
running again. He had not 
run in some time and had con-: 
siderable work to do if he was 
to attain his previous level of 
success.
He started his training last 
summer. I ran more last sum
mer than I had in any other 
previous summer. It was a 
lot of work, but slowly he man
aged to work the weight off 
and get back up to his previ
ous level.
One thing that kept him run
ning was the possibility of go
ing to nationals. However, 
the team had improved 
greatly. Moore was only able 
to come in fifth or sixth with 
the level of performance that 
had previously gotten him to 
the top. However, he continu
ally improved through the fall. 
He helped the team go to na
tionals, and in the last meet, 
which was the nationals, he 
came in first for the team, and 
was one of the top 100 in the 
nation.
Moore says that other 
people, mainly his teammates 
and coach, helped him get back 
into running.
Moore said, It would have 
been so easy to stop running. But 
he didnt. He said his teammates 
helped him a lot, supported him, 
and pushed him to keep trying and 
working. He said his family was 
also very supportive and helpful.
Although it was more difficult for 
him in the season following his sur
gery, because of the greater ability 
of the team in general, Moore 
worked hard all season long, and 
managed by the end to make his 
way back up to finish first in the 
last meet of the season, his last 
meet at CMU.
Moore has been long-distance run
ner for nine years now, ever since 
freshman year of high school. He 
had been running for so long, it 
would have been tough to give up. 
Also,, the races held a special inter
est for him. Moore said, I am basi
cally a competitive person.
Moore has no intention of giving 
up his running career. He is work
ing hard at school right now, with a 
typical CMU workload, which 
makes it difficult to get any serious 
running done, but as soon as he 
graduates in December, he plans to 
start training for the marathon in 
the spring. He is actively searching 
for a job at the moment, but says, 
My best years of running are prob
ably ahead of me.
Merck offers funds, 
gives opportunities
By DANIELLE PIERRATTI
Tartan Staffwriter
This year Nesta So got a little more 
than cake on her birthday. She won the 
Merck Undergraduate Fellowship, a 
scholarship and internship that is 
awarded each year to an undergraduate 
with an interest in computer science, 
information systems, and science. Each 
year, Merck awards a qualified under
graduate tuition support of $10,000 per 
year for two years as well as an intern
ship at Merck during the summer after 
the applicants junior year. It was a nice 
surprise for my birthday, said So, a 
junior information systems major. My 
friend sent email to congratulate me, 
that was when I was like ... hmmm ... is 
this real? So, I checked the bboard ... 
Later that night, I got email from my 
professor. I was sure it was real  [I 
was] really happy.
Merck is a pharmaceutical group in 
Europe, specializing in laboratory busi
ness and specialty chemicals with a 
strong commitment in North America 
and the growing markets in Southeast 
Asia. Merck has its own representations 
in 46 countries and 66 production plants 
in 28 different countries.
So said such a company is a good 
connection for any student looking to 
pursue a future in those fields. I hope I 
can apply what I learned at CMU to 
Merck, not just the material from class 
the IS stuff  but also the time manage
ment, team work, et cetera. I am also 
looking forward to exploring my multimedia experience and interacting with 
many different people.
This is not surprising, since it was her 
interaction skills as well as her interest 
in multimedia creation that So believes 
helped her win the fellowship to begin 
with. I think all the applicants have a 
strong academic background, strong per
sonal statements, 
strong recommenda
tions  I am sure all of 
them are very capable 
people. One thing I 
found especially impor
tant was the interview 
because thats the time 
that the company really 
got to know you. I think 
my interview went well 
... because I was very 
relaxed and [could] be 
myself. I went in just to 
talk.... I like talking to 
people and I find that 
people usually feel com
fortable [talking] to me 
too. I also mentioned my 
interest in multimedia 
creation. I am inter
ested in both informa
tion systems and infor
mation presentation. I 
think Merck found it in
teresting too, she said.
I was very relaxed at
the interview because I had an attitud 
that its a great experience even if I d0n 
get it. So I went in without a lot 
expectations.
However, there were a lot of othe 
preparations, as well as anticipate 
that comprised the application proces 
for hopeful recipients. I talked to th 
director of the SDS department and 
IDS advisor about it. I also contacted th 
winner of last year, Nathan Stark, 
seemed to be a great opportunity an 
experience to me, so I decided to appl 
for it, said So. The deadline of th 
application was September 31. I thin 
Merck then picked five, maybe six, peopl 
among those applicants for interview 
about two weeks later, she said.
As the recipient of the fellowship, 
now has many opportunities open 
her, as she had predicted. I think th 
award fits my plan very well, and I 
sure it is going to [help me] explor 
myself in all dimensions.
Given my background at CMU, 
think I want to do something related ti 
IS in the future. And at the same time 
do something more creative, like multi 
media creation, and marketing. IS stuf 
is pretty standard across industries 
the whole thing depends on how we u 
information. Who knows, because tech 
nology changes so fast. I might be doinj 
something that you and me have neve 
thought of! she said.
I am looking forward to the intern 
ship this summer, she said. I havi 
already gained a lot from the fellowshij 
through the application process, inter 
view ... everything. [Aside from] win 
ning the award, I think its still a grea 
experience. I have to say being an inter 
national student [makes it] hard [to get 
any kind of scholarship or fellowship 
the U.S. But I guess this experience hai 
taught me Tour hard work will defi 
nitely be paid off

Teachers give students a taste of life after college graduatioi
NOBLESVILLE, Ind. Nov. 22 
(AP)  With only $13 left in her 
bank account, Sarah Uglum still 
needs to buy groceries, clothing, 
insurance and a car.
Shes also going through a di
vorce and has to pay a lawyer, so 
she waits tables part time to help

Im not grown up enough to deal 
with this...
 Tabitha Hall, eighth grader at 
Noblesville Middle School
Students start out as 28-yearold single parents. Theyre given 
a salary based on a chosen ca
reer. Then they have to work 
with that money to find housing 
and transportation, buy grocer
ies and pay utility bills.
They have to deal with child
care, insurance and taxes. Along 
the way, students are hit with a 
few surprises, including more 
children, a car accident or win
ning the lottery.
This is a rip off, said eighthgrader Tammy Bradley after vis
iting the Uncle Sam booth.
There goes all my income.
She had about $475 taken out 
of her nurses salary in taxes. 
With her $1,794 monthly salary, 
she had to settle on an apart
ment for herself and her 6-yearold child.
A house would take the rest of 
my money, she said.
Tabitha Hall could afford a 
home for herself and her three 
young children based on a 
monthly income of $5,400 as a
radiologist.
But she soon found herself 
$139,000 in debt and making 
$1,097 in mortgage payments. 
And she was spending $660 a 
month at the Happy Miller Day 
Care.
Im not grown up enough to 
deal with this yet, Hall said. It 
makes me want to stay in school 
longer.

doubled, hmmm, how odd).
4) Get an even fancier, more expen
sive logo printed on color paper be
cause we all know that good PR makes 
for an efficient operation.
3) Combine another five offices into 
one and offer one sixth of the total 
former staff to operate it  result, 
even more fun, one-stop-shopping.
2) Put in more signs about more 
different kinds of lines. Dont have the 
lines actually exist, just the signs. At 
least this way there is more reading 
material while students wait.
And the number one way to improve 
The HUB, that dandy central place for 
all of our CMU woes:1) a smoking section.

major. He used to make fun of Dining 
Services a lot, but thanks to the hard 
work of Annett Allison, that no longer 
seems necessary.
CRACKING THE MYTH
by Elizabeth Irvine
I have contradictory feelings about 
Martha Stewart, the Waspy blonde home
maker who has both a television show 
and a magazine. On one hand, as an 
artist, I admire her creativity and craft. 
She has interesting ideas for home im
provement, and her magazine is beauti
fully photographed and designed.
But, as a feminist, I feel she is, on 
many levels, ridiculous, evenharmful. She is a glamorization ofhousekeeping, which is traditionally 
womans work. Her tips for the 
home extend from cooking to clean
ing, and her magazine covers mun
dane things such as her laundry 
facilities or her fireplaces. But, with 
11 books in print, almost 4 million copies, 
an award winning magazine which sells 
1.5 million copies an issue and her TV 
show Martha Stewart Living, she is an 
undeniable influence on womens expec
tations.
Named by Time magazine as one of 25 
of the most influential people, her enter
prise is worth millions of dollars. With 
Thanksgiving around the comer and the 
holiday seasonbeginning, Marthais cash
ing in on the idea of glamorized house
work. This time of year creates incredible 
stresses about family, home, and work, 
and Marthas domestic idealism is a diffi
cult role to follow in todays society.
Called by the media the diva of domes
ticity, Marthas world is a romantic fan
tasy which very few women can ever 
attain. I believe Martha began with good 
intentions. She raised the image ofhousekeeping to something creative, she illus
trated easy projects to make ones house 
more decorative, brighter for whatever 
occasion, but soon Martha became a parody 
of herself (and her recent projects are over 
the top).
On last years Thanksgiving episode of 
Martha Stewarts Living, Martha talked 
ofthejoys of raising livestock. She showed 
the different eggs of her 100 kinds of 
poultry and discussed them with a local 
turkey farmer. Another project was for 
Easter: fresh ham roasted for five hours 
was then served with organically grown
grass cut the same morning with dew 
still on it. Marthas original cheap and 
easy solutions have become unattain
able and comical goals. She is beyond the 
level to which most women can aspire. 
What woman in America has time to 
raise livestock besides going to work and 
taking care of kids?
Over half of all American families have 
two incomes, yet the domestic duties of the 
house, the food preparation and child care, 
fall on the shoulders of the woman. Martha 
does not make it easier for women.
She raises the expectations of womens 
work and makes it unattainable. Martha
fives in a beautiful fantasy world where 
women have time to raise chickens, make 
candles and stencils for Christmas cookies 
which then can be wrapped in gold leaf. 
Working women and men have to laugh at 
Marthas perfection and class and statusbased ideology. Her assumption that ev
eryone has the leisure, the money, and the 
desire to do what she does is interesting.
She projects a picture of an imaginary 
happy family life that never exists. She 
caters to a nostalgia when the women were 
in the kitchen, the family was sacred, and 
traditions kept alive.
Martha stresses the importance of fam
ily rituals and holidays and the impor
tance of homekeeping and garden keep
ing.
She takes womens traditional domestic 
responsibilities and puts a perfectionist 
twist on them, making them harder.
When the holidays come, it seems as 
though the brunt of the work falls on the 
shoulders of the mothers and wives, the 
women of the family. It is the mothers 
who are in charge of buying gifts, cook
ing the food, planning the gatherings, 
and it is the mothers who are blamed if 
the holiday is unsuccessful. Families 
and women are put under enormous 
pressure, and magazines and TV shows 
reinforce traditional roles with in the sea
son.
In 1963, Betty Friedan wrote the Femi
nine Mystique, addressing the problem 
with no name. The problem was depres
sion, which affected educated middle class 
women whose only creative outlet was 
through their children and domestic du
ties. Thirtythree years later, Martha 
Stewart is telling women to go back to the 
domestic obsession. Womenhave things to 
learn, people to see, and things to experi
ence; they dont need to fill their time with 
meaningless tasks.
Thirty-three years later, 
Martha Stewart is telling 
women to go back to the

The HUB began just last year. It 
was a move by the University to 
create a more efficient bu
reaucracy. Instead of stu
dents needing to go to five 
different offices to take 
care of their business, 
they could now go to 
just one. This way, a 
student with a ques
tion for enrollment

has to
ways to improve The HUB.
10) Remove all vegetation so as to 
avoid confusion as to which ones the 
associates are.
9) Replace The HUB with the IRS to 
cut down on bureaucracy.8) Put in a drop box for people who 
are just dropping off forms (OK, so this 
one isnt funny, but come on, it would 
help).
7) Get Lassie to work as an associate 
so more than just our parents receive a 
warm, drooling welcome on the phone.6) Offer both paper and plastic with 
your one-stop-shopping so that envi
ronmentally sound students can re
cycle the paper or suffocate themselves 
with the plastic.
5) Offer frequent waiting miles

Two graduate art students, 
Laleh Mehran and Emily 
Walazek, recently completed a 
public art project entitled By the 
Hands of Women which is cur
rently on display in Mellon 
Square Park. Collaborating with 
women at the Bethlehem 
Haven Shelter for Women, 
the two designed the 
project to increase aware
ness about the homeless 
community in Pittsburgh 
and to help increase the 
shelters visibility.
Both women chose 
Carnegie Mellon for their 
graduate studies partly due 
to the interdisciplinary na
ture of the curriculum in 
the art department, which 
allows them to work in dif
ferent areas of art. Mehran 
studied photography at the 
University of Florida and 
Walazek focused on paint
ing at the Massachusetts 
College of Art for their un
dergraduate studies. They 
welcomed the freedom that 
CMU offered them so they 
could expand their working 
knowledge of art forms.
Work began on the project 
a year and a half ago when 
Mehran and Walazek took 
one of the art departments 
community affiliation 
classes, which encourage 
students to do work outside 
of the college. They realized 
through talking in the class 
that they shared an interest in 
doing a project that expressed 
their concerns about 
homelessness in the community 
and decided to collaborate. Their
professor, Bob Gingham, advised 
them throughout the process.
The concept of the project de
veloped through discussions with 
residents at the Bethleham Ha
ven Shelter, an organiztion that 
provides shelter, food, clothing, 
and professional assistance to 
homeless women. Mehran and 
Walazek visited the shelter 
weekly for a semester, and after 
many conversations with the 
women, they decided on the theme 
of the importance of unity 
amongst women in the commu
nity and the imagery of womens 
hands reaching to help one an
other. Mellon Park, located only 
a block from the shelter, was cho
sen both for its proximity to the 
shelter and because it attracts a 
broad range of people from tour
ists to professionals working in 
downtown businesses.
The solid aluminum sculpture 
is composed of two curved verti
cal panels. On one side of the

Emily Walazek, is on display in Mellon Square Park.
panels appear hands reaching 
vertically for one another, which 
Mehran said shows the need for 
more unity in the community.
On the other side of each panel
appears text including quotations 
from the homeless woman and 
statistical information about 
homelessness and the Bethlehem 
Shelter because we wanted it to 
show the complexity of 
homelessness, said Walazek. 
Mehran said the quotations rep
resent thoughts the [homeless 
women] wanted to express.
The artists cast the shelter 
residents hands for the project. 
They chose to use aluminum be
cause of its lack of color and, 
Walazek says, so the hands couldbe anyones hands without re-^ 
gard to ethnic background.
Perseverance was a key to theprojects completion. Originally 
slated to be finished last May, By 
the Hands of Women was not in
stalled in Mellon Park until late 
October due to funding difficul
ties the artists encountered.
Walazek and Mehran say they 
have found it difficult to get their 
sculpture recognized because 
public art 
projects are of
ten not regarded 
as artwork. Two 
Pittsburgh 
newspapers ran 
photos of the 
project, but they 
hope to get it re
viewed by an art 
critic.
The sculpture 
will stay in 
Mellon Park for 
one year at 
which time it is 
up for rereview 
by the Public 
Art Commis
sion. If the Com
mission feels 
the project has 
been well-re
ceived by the 
public it may ex
tend the 
sculptures stay 
in the park. ^ 
Eventually the;'1 
artists plan to 
give the sculp
ture to the shel
ter which played 
such an integral 
part in its con
ception.
Mehran and Walazek have 
made outstanding contributions 
to the communty through the use 
of their incredible artistic talents.

DearFaculty Member:
preparing for their finals, we are preparing 
  risen drastically over the past - '"^lleee Stores)
Listed below are answers to questions relating to the Book Buy Back 
process. As a student, we know you have many questions about the book 
buy back. The. process is complex but this is meant to provide you with 
answers to the most common questions and explain the role of the book
store and the wholesaler.
Who is buying my books?
The person buying your books is a wholesale textbook representa
tive from. Follett Campus Resources.
Which books may I sell?
You may sell any book that you own that is required again on our 
campus or that has a value in the national wholesale buyers' guide. 
This guide consists of thousands of college textbook titles and their 
current national wholesale value.
What determines the value of books?
The value is determined by many factors. If it is being purchased 
by the bookstore for use on campus, you can typically expect an 
offer representing 50% of the net purchase price.
If the book is not being used again on campus, it has no value to 
the bookstore. Fortunately, we have negotiated with the wholesaler 
to offer the national wholesale price to you for your book. The 
price offered in the national wholesale buyers' guide is determined 
by many factors, including:
 Publisher's retail or list price for the book
 National demand for the book
 Unsold quantities of the book currently in the wholesalers 
warehouse
But I KNOW the book is being used again. Why did I only get 
the national wholesale price for the book?
For one of the following reasons:
 The instructor has not submitted the requisition; there 
fore the store is not aware that it is being used again
 The quantity required for use in the bookstore has al
ready been reached
As the students are prejjcu..0for next spring. Book prices have risen drasuv-c^several years and NACS (National Association of College Stores
has alerted us there is a worldwide paper shortage and that pa
per prices have risen from 4-6%. We are trying to help students 
save money by offering as many used books as possible. Text- - "naior investment for the students and the ability to  "ro/ off the new prices makes asave ^nY books are a major invesunt* offer students used books at 25% off the i

Please help us deliver textbooks to the students at the lowest 
possible price by submitting your textbook adoption forms by 
December 2. If the textbook adoption forms for the spring term 
have not been submitted, please contact Rita Witt at the Univer
sity Shoppe at x8-1033 or via Andrew mail @ rw3q. As soon as we 
know what books are to be used next term, we will be able to pay 
the student half-price for them and we will begin our national 
search for additional copies from a wholesaler.
It is our goal to support your efforts by making the course materi
als available to the students at the lowest possible cost. Together 
we can accomplish this by improving the used textbook program 
here at Carnegie Mellon and offer an improved service and a
better value to the students.
Thank you and we appreciate your help.

I bought this book brand new and have kept it in mint 
condition. Why is it now being called "no value?"
Although poor condition of a book could be a factor-in 
determining the value, your new book is probably the 
victim of the following:
 Publisher has produced or announced plans for a 
new edition
 Many copies of the text exist, but few schools are 
adopting it for their curriculum (supply & demand)
 Wholesaler is overstocked in warehouse
When does it make sense for me to keep my books 
vs. selling?
Any time you have a book that you may frequently 
use for quick reference it is good to keep it. Any time 
you feel the price you are being offered is less than 
the value you place on the book, you many find it 
wise to keep the book. In any case, we appreciate the 
opportunity to make an offer for your books.
What happens to the books I sell to the whole
saler?
The books are packed and shipped to the distribu
tion center. They are received, processed, and 
placed in the physical and computerized inven
tory. This will make them available for purchase 
by other bookstores nationwide.
How does this benefit me?
By selling your textbooks to your bookstore and 
to a national wholesale company, you are par
ticipating in a process which makes quality 
used textbooks available to you and future 
students at other colleges and universities. 
Used books represent one of the few opportu
nities for saving available in your pursuit of 
higher education. Finally, recycling textbooks 
is.an environmentally sound practice.
Pile up your textbooks and 
bring them to Book Buyback. Well give you 
cash for them. But you cant cash in 
unless you come in.
Book Buy Back.
It Pays to Be Part of It.
We buy books that can be reused here...or on other campuses.
RECYCLE 
FOR CASH
Thank you for the opportunity to explain the "mystery" of the used book 
buy back process. We hope this clears up any misconceptions and if you 
have any questions please feel free to contact me via my andrew mail 
address which, is ps40@andrew.cmu.edu.

SNS play surpasses 
critics expectations
Severinsen plays with Pops at Heinz
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan News Editor
Try to remember when there was a 
happier time in late night television,
1 before Letterman and Leno began batItling in the Late Night Wars. A time 
when one man ruled the roost, and that 
man was Johnny Carson. Now 
try to remember Johnnys side
kicks. Sure, there was Ed 
MacMahon, who has gone on 
\ from Tonight Show fame to promote the American Family 
Sweepstakes with Dick Clark,
but what about the crazy guy 
\ who led the band and wore outirageous clothes that Johnny 
i would always make fun of? Well,
'that was Doc Severinsen, and 
since his retirement from The 
[ Tonight Show, he has been busy 
| furthering his recording career 
and touring the country playing 
! trumpet with various orchestras 
and even his own big band. He 
graced the stage of Heinz Hall 
last Thursday to play with the 
Pittsburgh Pops under the new 
Assistant Conductor of the Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra,
Edward Cumming.
The orchestra warmed up with 
i piece by Shostakovich, an odd 
choice for a Pops concert, but 
nice nonetheless. However, halfway 
through the first half of the set, the 
reason why that piece was chosen to 
open the show became clear. Despite the 
i Pops concert format, Severinsen played 
mainly classical pieces, ranging from a
medley of famous Puccini arias to Carni
val ofVenice, a staple in any trumpeters 
repertoire.
With these familiar pieces, some of 
which Severinsen has made amazing 
recordings of, he had the potential to be 
more than great, he had the potential to 
be moving. There is usually not a dry eye
9uWloe!6 ub 29i TloH!Ho! 
Doc Severinsen plans to spend the rest of the 
year touring with various bands across the country.
in the house after any performance of 
Puccinis Nessun Dorma, but unfortu
nately, Severinsens rendition of it was 
an exception. At one point he told the 
audience that he was under the influ
ence of a trumpeters worst nightmare,
chapped lips, but chapped lips couldnt 
have been the only thing holding 
Severinson back from playing the com
mon pieces cleanly. His tone was airy 
and he missed many of the essential 
aspects of the songs because he was 
floundering on some complicated trick 
that wasnt vital to the piece in the first 
place. After a disappointing first set 
where Severinsens showmanship clearly 
outweighed his classical ability, the sec
ond set didnt look very promising.
But with a change of clothes, the addi
tion of a drum set, and extra piano and 
bass players, Severinsen launched into 
the second half with a great rendition of 
the theme from Ice Castles, a song for 
which he did the original recording. Af
ter that, it was smooth sailing and great 
Pops fare, as Doc seemed to get his chops 
back on standards like Side-by-Side and 
Bugler's Holiday. He even took to the 
podium to conduct the final two pieces of 
the evening, a medley of songs from 
Phantom of the Opera , on which he 
rivaled any voice with his flugelhom, 
and Sing! Sing! Sing! where he wailed 
in true Doc fashion to make it his best 
song of the night. It took a mediocre 
opening classical set, which had no busi
ness in a Pops concert to begin with, to 
get Doc up to speed. But he proved in the 
latter half of the concert that he was well 
worth the wait with his funny asides to 
the audience and jovial rapport with the 
other musicians. Despite the inconsis
tency of the show, Doc proved that he 
will never have to resort to supporting 
sweepstakes in commercials to make 
a living  hes doing fine right where 
he is.

The Living Room, the latest Scotch N 
Soda production, was a tale of love, hate, 
death, and deception, complete with 
black market dealings, comic relief, cor
rupt Army personnel, and a little incest 
to keep things interesting. More impor
tantly, it dealt with the tearing apart of 
a family, shattered beyond repair.
The plot of The Living Room centers 
around the death of Jenny, and features 
her twin brother Rick as the un
willing protagonist. Rick, we 
learn, was the murderer; he ap
parently planted plastic explo
sives on a boat, which destroyed 
all traces of his late sister. Much 
of the remainder of the play deals 
with the emotions and reactions 
of the various family members 
who attend Jennys funeral and 
their interactions with Rick. There 
are many problems within the 
family, we learn. Ricks father Bill 
has lost his job, the family is hav
ing financial difficulties, and to 
make the situation even worse, 
we learn that Bill has been raping 
Jenny regularly since he lost his 
job. Finally, we realize the extent 
of the familys decay, and why 
Rick states, I hate my family.
This would be the end of the play 
were it not for a major plot twist:
Jenny is not dead. The death was 
staged by Rick and Jenny to allow 
her to escape the abuse of their 
father, and the ruse has been suc
cessful. The final scene is a last goodbye 
in Ricks room, just before Jenny leaves 
for France.
Although the play seems to be revolv
ing around Jennys death, the real focus 
is on the feelings of the characters. This 
point recurs throughout the play, as 
Rick asks his mother, his father, and his 
cousin, Did you love Jenny? Feelings 
drive this play, and we learn that Rick 
needs to feel above all else. For the ma
jority of the play, however, he can only 
hate  hate that at Jennys funeral.

Thank God for Screeching Weasel. Rej uniting after a two-year hiatus, the 
Sunders of SuburbanCore pop-punk have 
unleashed Bark Like a Dog, a snotty in! uictment of apathy, vaccuous girls, and

they laid the tracks for the likes of Green

punk band to achieve mass popularity 
in the last 3 years, its about time you pay 
some respect to this Chicago bands highly 
opinionated goofy humor.
Originally titled ... And Out Come the 
Chihuahuas, (a mocking play on Rancids 
... And Out Come the Wolves), Bark Like A 
Dog opens with a bang, settles into a 
consistant groove, and then plows to a 
conclusion with some of the strongest 
songs in their career. Its a really cool

everything to these people, and individu

laughing all the way to the bank. The

apathy and cries to live for the day while

Screeching Weasel has always been a

C0WE HOWE FOR THE HOIDVS
QUAKERSTEAK 
& LUBE
>vBy TOMLIN 
** Tartan Staffwriter
If your son was kidnapped, how 
 ^much would you pay to get him 
::back? One million dollars? Two, 
' - JmilUion? Or would you refuse to 
a~J>ay anything at all?
What: Ransom 
Director: Ron Howard 
Company: Touchstone 
Pictures
; This is the scenario presented in 
j the recent release Ransom, a sus
penseful and gripping film which 
focuses on the trials of one such 
abductees parents, 
j Mel Gibson is Tom Mullen, a 
! {billionaire airline CEO who ap! parently has all the cards stacked 
; in his favor. Rene Russo plays his 
wife, Kate, who is smart, strong, 
and successful in her own right.
; Their lives quickly change from 
; ideal to nightmarish as their son 
; Sean, played by Brawley Nolte, is 
; kidnapped and held for a ransom 
; of two million dollars. The FBI is 
; soon called in, with Delroy Lindo 
as the head agent, and Tom
Mullens house is soon transformed 
into a base of operations for the 
Feds. In an attempt to get Sean 
back and capture Gary Sinise, the 
mastermind of the kidnapping 
operation, and his prerequisite 
band of henchmen, FBI 
intervention causes 
events to go awry. As a 
result, Tom hatches a 
desperate plan to get his 
son back unharmed. He 
appeal's on television and 
refuses to pay the ran
som, but instead offers it 
as a bounty on the 
kidnappers head, dead or alive.
Perhaps the reason Ransom was 
so engrossing was the fine acting 
by all the main characters. Mel 
Gibson is outraged, tearful, venge
ful, and convincing in his role, 
displaying his now formidable actingtalents. Also impressive is Rene 
Russo, though her rather limited 
role prevents her character from 
developing as much as would be 
hoped. Perhaps the most interest
ing personality in the movie is 
Gary Sinise, who departs radically 
from his recent good guy roles in 
Forrest Gump and Apollo 13 by 
playing a villain. Its a good career
choice for Sinise, who handily 
shows that he can play the oppo
site end of the character spectrum 
just as well, if not better, than his 
past work attests. Delroy Lindo 
and Lili Taylor round out the re
mainder of the cast, with strong 
supporting roles.
Though it is a very watchable 
film, there were several flaws in 
Ransom. The tension runs high 
when Sean is first kidnapped, but 
it lessens noticeably when the au
dience is first introduced to the 
kidnappers. Resembling a junior 
high school class more than a group 
of kidnappers, one got the distinct 
feeling that they werent a par
ticularly organized or intelligent 
group. Secondly, a complex and 
seemingly flawless scheme orga
nized by Sinise for the payment of 
the ransom is derailed when the
drop is botched by a combination 
of the FBI and one of the group 
members. Finally, Tom Mullens 
decision to refuse to pay the ran
som is almost beyond belief. Al
though the writers attempt to 
make the idea seem like 
the best choice, one cant 
help but think, Boy, was 
that stupid. In the end, 
these flaws do not detract 
significantly from the 
movie. The acting is ex
ceptional across the board, 
the plot is tight and well
paced, and there is enough 
suspense to keep you perched on 
the edge of your seat for most of 
the movie. Despite its flaws, the 
movie is still very entertaining.

The answer is a plethora of 
great songs by The Why Store. 
The group is composed of col
lege students who unintention
ally discovered each others fine 
musical talent and began to play 
the bar scene all throughout 
the midwest. In their early ca
reer, The Why Store gained the 
honor of performing at the 
HORDE Tour in 1993. During 
this time, with the help of many 
enthusiastic fans, they pro
duced two albums titled Wel
come to the Why Store and In
side the Why Store . Each of 
these albums, although suffer
ing a low print run, met with 
nominal success throughout the 
midwest.
Their third album, titled simpty The Why Store , explodes 
with a series of songs empha
sizing the technical and rhyth
mic professionals that they are. 
This latest installment contains 
a diversity of tunes which, if 
you listen carefully, can be in* terpreted as analogous to a va
riety of groups throughout the 
past decade.
One exclusive feature that 
makes this album a worthwhile 
listen is the low, raspy voice of 
the lead vocalist, Chris Shaffer. 
The song Lies shows Chriss 
ability to comprehend the mood
 of a heartfelt melody in a way
< not unlike that of Springsteen.
 The melody also features the
< steady and soft acoustical per
formance of lead guitarist 
Michael David Smith. Smiths 
fine guitar rifts are evident in 
songs such as Good to Me, 
where he complements 
Shaffers low, raspy voice with 
a flawless guitar melody. 
Shaffer shows an even deeper 
overtone to his vocals in possi
bly their most well-known song, 
Lack of Water. In this song, 
the bassist, Greg Gardner, and 
Michael David Smith create a 
melody which one might mis
take for one the Dire Straits 
made. Instead, Smith and 
Gardner add a quicker tempo 
and a crisper 90s feel to that 
particular swing, and then com
bine it with Shaffers unique 
vocals to create a truly incred
ible song. Also, a shining point 
of this song is the consistently 
diverse drum compilation 
which rages in the background 
despite the amazing vocal and 
acoustical performances that 
pinnacle the song. One song 
which truly expresses the blues 
type feel to this group would be 
Fade Away. In this song, 
Smith and Gardner create a 
beat similar to that of the old 
Blues Travelers, while Shaffer 
continues with his raspy voice 
which, in this song, sounds par
ticularly like that of the lead 
singer to Seven Mary Three.
Also, as all new CDs seem to 
have these days, this album 
has a shining love song titled 
Whenlm With You. This song 
features the eloquent key
boarding skills of Jeff Pedersen, 
with a series of intelligently 
composed notes which comple
ment Shaffers unusually mel
low vocals and the soft riffs of 
both Smith and Gardner. In an 
effort to come out of the western 
underground, The Why Store has 
put together an intricately or
chestrated compilation of di
verse musical accomplishments 
definitely worth a listen.
. The diverse sounds of The Why Store makes their latest CD a hit.
Band thrills Metropol audience
By CHARLES FRYMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The last time that I was at 
Metropol for a concert, I saw They
dancing. In fact, the only person 
who was really dancing was a 
drunk kid next to me. At one point,
Jack Dangers, the main force be
hind the band, even said, You can 
Might Be Giants. It was so dance, if you want to. This got some vocals. He was complecrowded and loud that, within some concert goers moving for a mented by a keyboardist, a bassthe show, which was actually 
very good. Dangers stood at his 
computer and drumpad and 
would step up to the microphone 
every once in  while to belt out
five minutes, a mother 
was dragging her crying 
child out of the throbbing 
mass of people. The ride 
to the concert, though, 
was uneventful.
The Meat Beat Mani
festo concert at Metropol 
last Tuesday was much 
calmer. No crying chil
dren or throbbingmasses 
this time, but the bus ride 
to the concert was a wild 
scene. My friend, Dave, 
and I had to talk to some 
big crazy guy who kept 
asking us if we knew 
about Fernandez and 
went on to explain how 
hemetBillCosbyinl972.
I could go on about all the 
marvelous things that 
this guy said, but some 
arent fit to print, and 
thats not what the article is about 
anyway. So lets get back to the 
concert.
Like I said, there wasnt much

while, but then the lets just stand 
here and listen philosophy took 
over again.
Still, everyone seemed to enjoy
ist and saxo
phone player, 
and a real drum
mer (not a 
drumpadder), 
who managed to 
play the entire 
show wildly 
without a break.
Then there 
was the screen 
 yes a big 
screen, like 
something right 
out of
Woodstock, with 
all sorts of inter
esting images 
projected onto it. 
There were 
films of subway 
tunnels, explo
sions, bullets go
ing through 
gelatin, and boots trodding 
through a field. There was also 
a recurring image of an ani
mated recycle symbol. The
screen also had plenty of pictures 
of bacteria, and infrared images 
of insects, and I think I even 
caught a glimpse of Mr. Spock.
If you could peel your eyes off 
the screen, though, youd get 
chance to listen to some cool mu
sic. Through the smoke and lights 
the four musicians cranked out 
one techno tune after another 
with hardly a chance to clap in 
between. It was the traditional 
Meat Beat Manifesto with great 
beats, lots of beeps and blips, and 
some cool samples. I recognized a 
few of the songs from the latest 
album, Subliminal Sandwich 
such as Shes Unreal and  
sassinator. My favorite song of 
the evening, though, was As! 
tos Lead Asbestos. It was great 
to see the live version of one of my 
favorites. I was dissapointed that 
they never played Nuclear 
Bomb, my absolute favorite from 
Subliminal Sandwich. I felt in
complete after the concert be
cause of its notable absence.
Despite this, the show was ex
cellent. Dangers put on a great 
live performance because of his 
interesting stage presence. When 
you combine the bus ride with the 
big screen and the great music, 
you have one rad concert.
Critic trashes disappointing album
By NEIL BABRA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Newest in the genre of 
trashabilly is the first fulllength record Cinema by the New 
York band Speedball Baby, for
merly of Matador Records.
Who: Speedball Baby 
What: Cinema 
Label: MCA Records
The band was created in late 
1991 when Matt Verta Ray from 
Madder Rose and Paul Corio from 
The Vacant Lot first synergized 
their talents with the somewhat 
inebriated sounding rantings of 
Ron Ward for a 7 EP. Wards 
earlier work included vocalizing 
for Crush (1987-1989) and engagingin transsexual experiences 
with Bostons infamous Wobbly 
Organ (1985-1988), as well as 
spoken word performances with 
Juliana Hatfield and playing 
Kramers body double on the NBC 
show Seinfeld. Since that first 
effort and their 10 EP Get 
Straight for the Last Supper, on 
which they covered Van Morrison 
and The Ramones, Speedball 
Baby has dropped drummer Dave 
Roy and bassist Paul Corio for 
Martin Owens and Ali Smith.
In the first actual song, Rub
ber Connection, the singer 
screams about a cryptic unsatis
fied need, and the piece is 
drowned in repetition. During the
third track, Black Cat Moan, 
Ward howls, You think youre 
the black cat, but Im the one 
living in the jungle! Suicide 
Girl, the bands attempt at a 
mellifluous rock song, is abso
lutely pathetic, though its prob
ably the best track on the album. 
Black-Eyed Girl is a staccatoguitared, seemingly improvised 
tune which thankfully doesnt 
resemble Van Morrisons BrownEyed Girl. The sixth track, Dog 
on Fire, is a 20 second rant which 
leads into Skull Poppin, Skin 
Tastin, Love Wastin Son of a 
Bitch. The title caused me to 
anticipate this one the most, but 
it was a painfully slow song that 
turned out to be one of the longest 
tracks on the album, clocking in 
at over four minutes. Shakin It 
Loose was high-tempo but for
gettable, and the title cut, Cin
ema, was hilarious; thus it had 
some value. It sounded as ifVerta 
Ray was a surf-rocker who had 
just been hung. Mr. Heat was 
beyond Speedball Babys regular 
performing ability, though the 
melody was simple and ultimately 
repetitive; it was about two min
utes too long. The remaining 
tracks, Dancin with a Fever, 
Toss My Salad, and Drug Owl, 
are too atrocious to discuss.
Despite their somewhat im
pressive background, neat-look
ing pictures in the CD booklet, 
and funny song titles like Toss 
My Salad and Skull Poppin, 
Skin Tastin, Love Wastin Son of
a Bitch, Speedball Babys new
est album is a total piece of crap. 
They sound like a drunk bunch 
of idiots screaming about noth
ing in their garage. Even if you 
like psychobilly or trashabilly 
music, Speedball Baby simply 
has nothing to offer. From the 
first track, the church sermon
can make a man feel thirteen feet 
tall, and brain blew open; scat
tered bits of trash all over the 
eyes of another green-eyed, blue
eyed junkie. While bands of their 
sort are supposed to be comical 
and somewhat cacophonic, 
Speedball Baby does not synthe
size the overall crazed feeling 6f,
Y GG? i9T
Speedball Babys new album, Cinema, offers trashabilly music that 
pales in comparison to other artists in the same genre.

Trainspotting
Ah, heroin: If it werent illegal, everyone would 
be taking it. To prove it, some Scottish folks made 
a movie featuring the wacky exploits of a band of 
smack addicts. See the dead baby! Smell the def
ecation! Fish for a suppository! Make the monkey 
with an underage girl! Main-lining has never been 
this much fun.
Anyway, this was a pretty classy movie. In the 
tradition of Rambo and Brother From Another 
Planet, the jolly adventures of these crazy, crankaddled misfits will keep you in stitches. And of 
course Henry the Horse dances the waltz.

Time Bandits
Terry Gilliam directs this romp through time 
featuring the acting talents of the late Sean 
Connery, John Cleese, Michael Palin, and six 
dwarves. Ok, heres how it works: Gilliam decided 
to do a sort of a trilogy. He started with Brazil, 
which was middle-age then made Time Bandits, 
which breaks down to childhood, and The Adven
tures of Baron Munchausen, which was about oldage. Overall, its an interesting little set of films.
Gilliam is the guy who made all those funny 
cartoons in Monty Pythons Flying Circus. You 
know, the ones with the naked ladies and the feet 
that smashed people. Thats pretty cool, in itself.
So go ahead and whine and moan: Oh, I dont 
have time to see this movie. I have too much to do. 
Well, youll be missing out on the prime of your life, 
dog-boy.

Well...
Well...
Ok. Its one of those exploitation films like Reefer 
Madness and Monkey-loving Madness that they 
made back in the fifties. Your usual fare: They 
show the rise and fall of a bunch of kids who once 
had sex. Trust me, itll scare the pants onto you.
In closing, Id like to thank all the little people 
who made this possible: Charles Darwin, John 
Steinbeck, Tom Bosley, Tom Bosley, Tom Bosley,

Cesario quickly becomes the

sends his servant on a special 
mission  to deliver the dukes 
declaration of love to Lady Olivia 
(Ivy Vahanian). Olivia, however,

years following the recent deaths
By DAN ROSENBERG
Tartan Staffwriter
Before Tootsie and The Bird
cage, there was William 
Shakespeares witty farce Twelfth 
Night (playing in the Kresge 
through December 7), featuring 
cross-dressing, gender confusion, 
mistaken identities, and, unless 
my ears deceived me, 
a masturbation joke.
Not bad for something 
written at the dawn 
of the 17th century 
a time when even Bob 
Dole would have been 
considered a liberal.
Night begins with 
young maiden Viola 
(Lori Rom) coming 
ashore in the fictitious 
country of Illyria af
ter a shipwreck. Be
lieving that her twin 
brother, with whom 
she was traveling has 
perished, Viola de

in her brothers uni
form, pulls her hair 
back, and adopts the name 
Cesario. Disguised as a man, 
she enters the court of Orsino 
. (Juan Rivera), the country's mon
arch. She finds herself instantly 
attracted to the Duke and Orsino 
takes a liking to Viola as well. 
Unfortunately for her, Orsino
of her brother and father. This 
vow of celibacy is immediately 
disregarded, however, when 
Olivia meets Cesario. She is in
stantly attracted to, the page, 
who, of course, does not know 
how to respond to advances from 
another woman.
This love triangle is just the 
beginning of the farce. Olivias 
servant Malvolio (Doug Howe) is 
also infatuated with his lady, and 
as a result of a forged letter, mis
takenly believes that she loves 
him as well. To make matters 
worse, Violas brother Sebastian 
(who thinks that his sister died in 
the wreck) appears in the second 
act. Of course, since Viola is 
wearing one of her brothers 
uniforms, they not only look 
alike, they are also dressed 
alike as well. As a result, 
Sebastian (Steven Dunlap) 
gets entangled in a 
swordfight with strangers 
and has to deal with the ad
vances of Lady Olivia. Not 
surprisingly, his reactions 
to the ladys flirtations are 
much different than those of 
his shy sister. Adding to the 
convoluted plot is an alco
holic uncle (Mark 
Engelhardt) and his dimwitted crony (Andrew S. 
Lukich), a scheming maid
servant (Amy Dommer), and 
Olivias witty fool (Tressa 
N. Pope), the smartest char
acter in the play.
Night starts off rather 
slowly. There are very few 
laughs in the first hornand 
the plot is hard to follow. Adding 
to the distraction is the fact that 
a percentage of the audience is 
sitting behind the stage. (Who
ever decided to put spectators 
back there is more foolish than 
the characters in the play who 
actually believe that the lovely
Viola is a man.) It got to the point 
where watching the manneristns 
of the upstage audience was in<jjre 
interesting than the play. How
ever, as the farce began to bujld 
toward the end of the first apt, 
the play becomes progressively 
better.
By the second act, when the 
confusion begins to pan out, the 
play is in full gear and the laugihs 
come regularly. There is a won
derfully amusing swordfight be
tween Cesario and Lukichs 5>ir 
Andrew. Both are incompetent 
swordsmen, and neither indi
vidual wishes to fight the othfer, 
but they are coerced into combat 
by Engelhardts Sir Toby ahd 
Dondre Greenhouses Fabian. 
The plays climax (when the tjvo 
siblings meet and the remainder 
of the characters think thlat 
theyre seeing double) is equally 
delightful, featuring a remark
able performance by Vahanian. 
Her reactions as everything fls 
into place are fantastic.
By the end of the play, it .no 
longer matters that Roms Viola 
passes for a man about as weUjjas 
Alicia Silverstone would. Nor dties 
it matter that the minimal re
semblance beteween Viola a;hd 
her brother could never resultiin 
mistakening them for the sain 
person. In a comedy as good Jas 
this, the viewer is willing to sus
pend his disbelief and enjoy t^he 
show. Director Gregory Lehspae 
has crafted Twelfth Night so that, 
by the end, I was so engrossec^in 
the riotous storyline, I would h^ve 
accepted Bill Cosby as Roms tv*$n.
Disgruntled listener gags on Sugarspoon
By JESSICA RHODES
Tartan Staffwriter
I just had a feeling when I 
picked up this CD that it was 
going to be bad  I was right. 
Sugarspoon is new on the alter
native music scene and, with any 
luck, we wont hear too much more 
from them.
Who: Sugarspoon 
What: Sugarspoon 
Label: MCA Records
The album, at some points, has 
the sound of a re-heated quasiAlice and Chains band mixed with 
that infamous college/alternative 
music  only worse. The guitar 
wavers between being bearable 
and annoyingly whiny. Some of 
the songs remind me of those 
awful glam-rock ballads from the 
80s. Now thats bad.
Somehow their lyrics dont even 
match their instrumental style. 
For instance, on Butterfly 
Breeze and Wish You Were 
Here, the song actually starts off
okay, but then they start singing 
and the music goes downhill from 
there. It seems as if the boys of 
Sugarspoon are trying to be mean
ingful and appeal to us Genera
tion X-ers, but they just dont 
seem to get it. I dont claim to be 
apoet-laureate, but pleaseIts 
so nice when we all die. Its so 
nice and Im so numb. And noth
ing can kill us with time. Or bor
row our conscience then  gag 
me with a Sugarspoon.
Sugarspoon has a knack for cov
ering the really cool instrumen
tal parts with their silly lyrics 
when they should be singing over 
the guitar solos and bridges. By 
far, the most annoying part of 
the album is the lack of varia
tion  the music is completely 
predictable.
Now, I dont want to go off on 
these guys completely  their 
liner notes are nice. Although 
Im still wondering how this band 
even got a contract with MCA. I 
consider myself open to many 
genres of music, but isnt this 
alternative stuff getting a little 
out of hand? Although I hate
MTV, Im certainly not looking 
forward to a buzz clip featuring 
Sugarspoon. I really tried to be 
nice and listen to all of the tracks 
and not one of them was appeal
ing. Maybe this is the kind of
music you have to grow into, qut 
I only had the intestinal fortitude 
to listen to this CD once. >
Ive had just one dose from the 
Sugarspoon and it gave me! a 
stomach ache. >,

Star Trek flick appeals to broad audience
What: Star Trek: First Contact 
Director: Jonathan Frakes 
Company: Paramount Pictures
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Staffwriter
I am by no means a Star Trek fanatic, but I have to admit that I was 
psyched from the outset to see this movie.
If youve seen Star Trek: The Next Generation a few times, youve 
probably run across the Borg and know that they are almost a sure
fire cool source of sto
ries. First Contact is 
no exception.
The story is intri
cate and well con
structed, full of clever 
little twists and tie ins 
to other portions of the Star Trek mythos, which will please 
the die-hard trekkies. Heres a little bit of the story, but Ill try not 
to give too much away, just what the previews have already hinted 
at.
First off, for you non-trekkies, a little background info. The Borg 
are a collective of cybernetic beings (half-humanoid, half-machine) 
that grow and develop by finding new civilizations and assimilat
ing them, meaning the Borg drug them and add their distinctive
ness to the collective Borg. They operate with a hive mind, there is 
no individuality. Very scary stuff, kind of like a combination of bees 
and Robocop.
First Contact starts with a little flashback to Picards previous 
experience with the Borg, when he was assimilated. He survived, 
but is, of course, a little bitter about the whole experience. This 
becomes a very important aspect in the movie towards the end, but 
Ill only say that and nothing more, just to tease you. Nyah.
After that the Borg show up in their dark and fearsome cube, 
headed for Earth, and all kinds of cool Star Trek related things 
happen, including time travel and lots of explosions and photon 
torpedoes.
The story wastes no time in starting, a definite plus in their favor. 
Thats one of the advantages of having an established story world, 
with characters and situations already in place.
This movie should appeal to more than just fans of Star Trek. First 
Contact is a great science fiction epic in its own right, as well as being 
a chunk of the ever evolving Star Trek universe. The special effects 
are spectacular (though all the flashing lights on open circuitry was 
a bit much) and the acting was not overshadowed; on the contrary, 
it was surprisingly tight.
My only complaint is that the stars are starting to look older. Poor 
Deanna Troi aint what she used to be. Except Patrick Stewart. He 
still doesnt look a day over 60. But, Im sure that will be no obstacle 
to their continued production of future Star Trek sequels, so long as 
they keep coming up with quality story lines and lay off the cheese 
of the previous two.
