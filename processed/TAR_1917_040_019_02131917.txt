ing every day. Letters were sent 
out to all the varsity C men ex
plaining this proposed organization 
and inviting all men to be present 
x the first meeting on February 23,<

Many answers have been received 
f.rom men all over the country, offer
ing their support and encouragement 
for the new organization. Men are 
coming from places as far distant as 
Akron, Ohio, for the first meeting 
on February 23. The old varsity 
men are showing much enthusiasm 
about the clan. One old football 
man wrote: "Finest thing started at
Tech for a long time. I will certain
ly be there. There are very few of 
the letters that do not contain some 
such thing as: Nothing can keep 
me away, Most certainly want to 
be a clan member, Count me in 
on whatever is done, Hold me a 
seat, for Ill be there.
It is especially urged that all var
sity C men in school at present I 
be present. There will be a reserved i

First Meeting to be Held Feb. 
18 atBellefield Presbyterian 
Church
Beginning Sunday afternoon, Feb
ruary IS, the Young Mens Christian 
Association of Pitt and Tech will 
hold joint meetings at the Bellefield 
Presbyterian Church. The pastor of 
the church, Rev. Robert MacGowan, 
will be the speaker at the first meet
ing. The men of Science and In
dustries have already had an op
portunity to hear Rev. MacGowan, 
when he addressed their assemblies 
under the auspices of the Tech Y. 
M. C. A., just before the close of last 
semester. The interest which was 
then displayed by the students who 
heard him speaks well for the prob
able success of the coming joint 
meeting. His topic will be Unseen 
Allies.
This new institution which is about 
to be started in the student life of 
the two schools is being arranged by 
the cabinets of the two associations. 
The meetings will be strictly unde
nominational, and will be addressed 
from time to time by some of the 
best Y. M. Of A. speakers in the 
country. Music for the first meeting 
will be furnished by a double quar 
tette from Pitt, and by Ralph S. 
Merker presiderft of the Tech Y. M.

be an informal social hour in the 
basement of the church, which has 
been furnished as a rest room for 
the students.
The meetings will be in the audi
torium of the church, which is at 
.the corner of Bellefield and Fifth 
avenues. They will begin promptly 
at 3 oclock, Sunday afternoon.
MR. WEBBER DIRECTS 
ANOTHER PRODUCTION
It is said that Julius Caesar could 
dictate six letters at once and play 
a game of golf at the same time, but 
there was only one Caesar. In mod 
ern times a man who can do two 
things at the same time and do them 
well is regarded as something of a 
genius. Such a man is Bertram S. 
Webber, director of the Glee Club of 
the Carnegie Musical Clubs and of 
the Choral Club.
Mr. Webber has been connected 
with the Choral Club for two years; 
and with the Glee Club since the 
beginning of the present season.
Those who heard the presentation 
of Hallelujah Chorus from Han
del's Messiah will appreciate what 
Mr. Webber can do with untrained 
voices. The performance of The 
Mikado re-enfoijped this opinion, and 
also showed Mr. Webber's ability in 
the direction of dramatic music.

on the feed which will be held prob
ably in Oakland. The date and 
place will be announced later.
As membership tickets are neces

DELIGHTFUL DANCE
A very enjoyable dance was held 
at the Zeta Lambda Epsilon frater

usually delightful music was ren

dance lasted from 9 until 2, and was 
chaperoned by Prof. and Mrs. Stan

their wives were present. The dance 
was doubly enjoyable on account of 
the freedom from school worries.

VARSITY WINS FROM WESTINGHOUSE 34-26
Plaid Team Started the Game 
on the Jump and Kept Their 
Lead Until Finish
Last Saturday. night on the Westinghouse Club floor at Wilklnsburg, 
the rejuvenated varsity was returned 
winner over the club team by a 
score of 34 to 26. The Plaid jumped 
into the lead at the start at S to 3, 
and never relinquished their advant
age, although at one time it was 
threatened. Once in the second half, 
when the varsity were up in the air 
through excitement, Coach McCul
lough saved the day. He sent Foxen 
into the game with instructions to 
settle down and pass more. Im
mediately the varsity braced and 
spurted. At other times Mr. McCul
lough showed good judgment by tak
ing out Carey, the first minute he 
showed signs of tiring and by re
placing Williams by Levy, when 
Vet was missing a play.
The game was rough throughout, 
many fouls being missed that should 
have been called.
Abrams timely foul shooting was 
a big factor, Lefty being high 
scorer for his team, with 20 points. 
Capt. Eddie Greene and Finlay both 
played a good game, Nig showing a 
pleasing tendency to pass rather 
than trying long shots at the basket.

THOMAS ALVA EDISON." Y
OUR COUNTRY
During this crisis in the history, and the welfare, and the des
tiny of our great country, it behooves us to look carefully into our
selves, and to investigate whether or not we have all the qualifications 
which go together to form that character which is typical of true 
American citizenship. We must make sure that that spark of patriot
ism within us, is of sufficient warmth, that in the event of necessity, 
it would suddenly burst into a flame of love for the Stars and Stripes.
A mere realization of our duty to the Flag is not enough. Actions 
impelled by duty do not bring the results obtained by lovethat love 
for our country which knows no bounds, realizes no limitations, and
deems no sacrifice too great.
The nation, in the event of 
necessity,"would look to the col
lege man to do his part-he has 
done so in former times, and no 
doubt will do so in the future. 
Many of the most glorious ex
amples of heroism, sclJ-saeriiice, 
bravery and patriotism were en
acted by college men in the Civil 
War.
We do not clamor for war, 
nor desire to draw the sword 
without necessity; far rather would we advocate poacefbut not at 
the sacrifice of national honor. .The honor of the nation must be 
maintained.
Our beloved founder, Androw Carnegie, is a groat advocate of 
peace, and VO students oil! that school, which boars his name, which 
was conceived by him and maintained by him, we are loyal to his 
ideal. Wo realize, without question, that his views of peace are 
praiseworthy, although evidently the wojld is not ready to aeccpt 
them yV.L Hut should it come to a question of act;ion, it would not 
be, the purl; oi! the students o.l! the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
to staijd l/y nu,d vvn|,c.h others do then* duty.
Within' the Inst lew days id has come to our notice that a former 
studonl ol! ilic M. M. C. S. has already declared hot intention to join 
the.ll&lVOro.ssi It is such patriotism, and such love for the country 
which .will make the nation proud of iW college students. It is not 
the mere  wear-n-ilag-on-your-eoal  patriotism which counts, bitt the 
kind of patriotism shown by this girl, which makes us worthy to be 
called U. S. citizens.
Our attitude, therefore, should beto hope and pray that our 
great nation will not be drawn, into the conflict, but that in the event 
of defending national honor, we would do our share, not only for 
the sake of duty, but for the love which every true American bears 
for the Stars and Stripes.
matic abilities free rein, and has 
produced an entertainment which the 
club members feel is far better than 
any previous one.
Taken all-in-all, the program, for 
this years Home Concert should be 
satisfactory to everyone. The first 
part is for those who come for the 
music only; the second part will 
please those who come for the 
music, but wish some further enter
tainment.
The clubs have been divided into 
two teams for ticket selling. The 
side selling the fewer number will 
provide a banquet for the other side. 
Buy early and help out one team or 
the other.
The prices range from fifty cents 
to one dollar and a half. As in pre
vious years, holders of two $1 or 
two $1.50 tickets is entitled to se
cure a dance ticket for an additional 
dollar. This dance will be held in 
the Hotel Schenley after the concert, 
and is the one big All Schools 
dance of the year.

RESERVES BEAT PLEBES 
BY SINGLE POINT, 20-19
In a close fought game preliminary 
to main set to, the Plebes were 
nosed out in the last half minute of 
play.  A field goal by Dalzell just 
before the whistle blew turned the 
trick. The Westinghouse Reserves 
and the Yearlings were evenly 
matched, the greatest lead being 4 
point when the score stood 14 to 10 
against the Skibos at the beginning 
of the second half. The Closeness 
of play is shown by the fact that 
the score was tied 0 times.
The Plebes seemed to have the 
game safely bagged with a one-point 
lead and the whistle about to blow 
when Dalzell received the ball on a 
pass for a clear try which did the 
deadly work. The final score was
19 to 20.

A MATTER OF HONOR
It lias been called to our attention by numerous individuals and 
circumstances, that the behavior of some oi the students at the 
school restaurant leaves much to be desired. The restaurant man
agement informs us that within the last few years no less than five 
hundred small spoons have disappeared from the Beanery. It 
seems to us that when such a practice reaches such proportions it 
is time that some definite student sentiment should be formed in 
order to bring about a readjustment of this condition. And the only 
way to bring about this readjustment is by a realization of the 
wrong done. No doubt anyone who regards sucli a matter in a 
trifling-way does so by thoughtlessness.
It seems to be a characteristic of the average college student 
to have an inherent tendency to collect, all sorts or manner of ar
ticles, which, although small in valno, are not his by right. Signs, 
posters, spoons; ash trays, glasses, ctc., seem to rank high in value 
lor tho iiforo mentioned oolloction. In cash, rvalue those articles 
would probably not amount to much, although five hundred spoons 
would probably run high enough into figures, to make (lie sum 
seem appreciable. These are facts. Tho matter may seem trifling 
but nevertheless, it is a matter of honor, and allhough it may be 
only a little thing, one famous man said, By the little things shall 
you be judged.
'When a student comes to Tech he is told that, lie is a Tech 
man. He learns that that means honor and responsibility. The 
honor is great, so is also its supplementary responsibility. This re
sponsibility is simply to be a man's man and a Tech man. It sounds 
easy but those who have tried to uphold this responsibility know 
that it is not.
The beanery management also knows that many have not 
learned to uphold this P onsibility!

War is the result of a triangle 
of desires or the primitive instincts 
of mandesire for food, wealth or 
power, take it from Prof. Allen H. 
Willett of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. In a lecture on The 
Causes of War last Friday night in 
the Carnegie Lecture Hall he ex
plained it thus:
In the last analysis of the causes 
jot war today we arrive at the con
clusion that the underlying cause is 
one of the primitive instincts of 
mans nature that caused the sav
ages to fight and tribes to go against 
each other before the formation of 
nations.
Why are the masses of the peo
ple, who have nothing to gain and 
everything to lose, ready and anxi
ous to fight? These primitive in
stincts are the answer. War, wheth
er we consider it as waged in 
Europe today or as this country 
might be involved in war, due to the 
present crisis will benefit only the 
Wealthy class. The instincts that 
cause war would die out; if left alone, 
but we insist; on educating our chil
dren. to the belief that the highest 
honor is readiness to fight.
By the present method of educa
tion we laud military and naval 
heroes. There are greater heroes 
than those who fight. Every time 
our soldiers or National Guard or
ganizations march out we raise flags 
and sing patriotic songs, and look 
upon them as the great men of the 
land. Men do not realize that the 
time to manifest their patriotism is 
in. time of peace.. There is a greater 
duty to perform than on the battle
field.
The United States is now enter
ing a period of development of for
eign trade. We now are furnishing 
material to foreign countries simply 
because England and Germany can
not ship to them. Foreign trade is 
dangerous because of the rivalry it 
creates for foreign markets which 
often leads to wars.
Preparedness has a decided effect 
on the course of wars. The hazy ru
mors that we will eventually have 
to meet Japan in a conquest for the 
mastery of the Pacific has caused 
 both' countries to build more ships 
year after year.
England and Germany have been 
in a bitter conquest of preparedness 
for the past 25 years.

Washington Monument (on foot by 
all who would not wait 20 minutes 
for the elevator) after a brief visit 
to the Bureau of Engraving, where 
stamps and banknotes and green
backs In process of manufacture 
were visible from well-guarded bal
conies. Before returning to the hotel 
for dinner the men put in another 
hour in the Smithsonian Institution 
and the National Museum. Those 
whose energies permitted refreshed 
their weary minds that evening in 
one of Keith's vaudeville institu
tions.
The next day was spent almost en
tirely in the Government Printing Of
fice, which is a huge and well-order
ed plant designed to produce all the 
government printed matter in as
tonishingly quick time. Visitors are 
often shown this establishment, but 
the Tech party was unusually fortu
nate in its guidance, and saw not 
only the customary round of inspec
tion, but a number of other details 
of operation not of interest to casual 
visitors but highly so to the student 
observers. That evening the party 
proceeded to Philadelphia.
From the Hanover Hotel as a base, 
the first morning in the Quaker City 
was spent in' the Curtis Publishing 
Companys plant. The S. A. I. stu
dents have seen many of its activi
ties in movies at' assembly. All 
these things were witnessed at first 
hand, and everything in magazine 
making, from preparation of the copy 
to the wrapping and mailing of the 
finished product was under way and 
open to careful observation. This 
visit was followed by a luncheon at 
the Manufacturers Club, given, by 
the Monotype Company. That after
noon the boys journeyed to the plant 
of the Monotype Company. This was 
interesting as producing composing 
machines of great precision and 
adaptability of use. All through the 
shops the work under way was of 
the highest grade, measurements in 
most cases being accurate to the 
thousandth and even the 1 ten-thou
sandth of an inch. In the evening 
the students were the guests of the 
Philadelphia Typothetae at the Meri
dian Club. Here they met a number 
of noted members of their craft, in
cluding Messrs. Lawrence, Robert 
and William Fell, Heath, Strong and 
Stern, of Philadelphia; William 
Green, of New York, and Albert Fin
lay, of Boston.
Thursday morning the party in
spected the Dill & Collins paper 
plant, where book papers, both 
coated and uncoated, are produced 
On their return to the city the men 
wero again guests at a luncheon, this 
time given by tire paper company at 
the Arcadia Restaurant. They then 
caught the 4:00 train for New York. 
That evening the party might have 
been gazing from a safe distance at 
tho Ice Ballet, Poor Butterfly, An
nette Kollerman and the other featuros that make up the Big Show 
at the Hippodrome
Friday was spent mostly at the 
American Type Founders' plant, In 
Jersey City, where a complete expo
sition of the past and present of 
their art, from matrix cutting to 
packing up the finished type, with 
certain digressions in, the way of 
press building and furniture making,
I was interrupted by another sumptuI ous meal. Late in the afternoon,
I about half an hour, was used to in
spect the plant of the Zeese-Wilkinson Company, color printers. In the 
evening a group of New York print
ers were hosts at a dinner at the 
National Arts Club. Among them 
were Messrs. Oswald, Green, Gress, 
Goudy, Stevens, Bullens, Ommen and 
Lisiecki.
Saturday the plant of the Doubleday-Page Company was visited. On 
their return the boys were lunched 
by Messrs. Frank Lisiecki, senior 
and junior, the latter being a former 
student of the department. The rest 
of the afternoon was' spent at the 
Metropolitan Art Museum after which 
the party was officially disbanded. 
Some of the men stayed over Sun

When you smoke your 
first Murad, you wont 
merely say:
This is a better cigarette 
than the 15 Cent brand Ive 
been smoking.
Youll say:
Why, this Murad is a 
Revelation. Many 25 Cent 
brands are hot so good.
That is the BIG POINT on 
which Murad beats the world 
 a 15 Cent cigarette thats 
Better than most of the 25 
Cent brands.
