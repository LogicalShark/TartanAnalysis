In response to growing criticism from 
students, as well as their own concerns, 
Student Senate and the Student Dormi
tory Council (SDC) General Body passed 
a joint resolution last week condemning 
the administrations handling of new
modifications to OnLine __________
Registration (OLR). The 
resolution stopped short 
of criticizing the actual 
changes, and instead fo
cused on the steps leading 
up to the implementation 
of those changes.
There has been a lot of 
concern about the imple
mentation of the new OLR 
system here at CMU, said 
junior history major and Student Body 
President Sarah Gross. As a result, the 
Student Senate and SDC, possibly for 
the first time ever, ratified a joint reso
lution on Wednesday to send a letter to 
the administration regarding OLR.
Four students spearheaded the ef
fort to pass the resolution in both Sen
ate and SDC. They were Student Sen
ate Academic Affairs Committee chair 
and senior mechanical engineering ma
jor Amy Ng, senior computer science 
major Matthew Sheby, junior physics 
major Robert Daugherty, and senior 
physics major and member of both SenBesides the message that the letter is 
intended to send, I think it shows that 
we are very united on this. 
 Dominic Falso 
Student Senator and SDC member
ate and SDC Dominic Falso. Falso is 
collecting student responses to the reso
lution for SDC and Senate.
After the text was agreed upon, it was 
sent to a number of administrators, in
cluding Bill Elliot, vice president for
Enrollment and the OLR Steering 
Committe chair, and President Cohon.
Besides the message that the letter is 
intended to send, I think it shows that 
we are very united on this, said Falso. I 
think its very strong in that regard. 
The letter reads, in part, We, the 
undersigned organizations, as represen
tatives of the Undergraduate Student
_______________ Body, wish to express
our dissatisfaction 
regarding the cur
rent implementation 
of OnLine Registra
tion. Both in plan
ning and implemen
tation, we feel that 
the Undergraduate 
Student Body has 
only been superficially involved, and 
has not had their wishes considered. 
The goal of the statement is that they 
recognize that they didnt get adequate 
student input, saidNg. From the meet

Every semester it seems that 
there is at least one burning issue 
that students want to express their 
opinion about. Calling an

representatives together to go over 
all of the issues facing CMU.
Last Friday, the first of two 
Town Meetings was held in the 
UCs Conan room. The meetings, 
which are open to all students, 
are meant to be a forum for stu
dent input. The remaining Town 
Meeting scheduled for this se
mester is taking place tonight at
7 pm in the Conan Room.
Fridays meeting was run by
The first topic of discussion was 
the recent change to OLR. The 
students who spoke were upset 
with the changes and the timeli
ness of the announcement. Most 
of the comments reflected a de
sire to have a faster system for 
OLR, not a lottery.
According to senior senior me
chanical engineering major and 
Student Senate Academic Af
fairs Committee chair Amy Ng,
including the Morewood Base
ment project, which has been 
stalled this semester. Gross, who 
has beenrunningthe project, said 
that a vendor had been through 
the space and that hours would 
probably extend to 2 am. How
ever, the question of whether or 
not students would be able to 
smoke in the space remains.
A goal of students who have 
been working on the project has
been to provide an indoor smok
ing area for students on campus.. 
However, there are concerns 
about the location of the 
Morewood Basement as a smok
ing area since it lies directly be
low the recently renovated child 
care center.
Issues of long-standing concern 
such as a Squirrel Hill shuttle 
and the use of CampusXpress off 
campus were also discussed. 
Gross and Stovall were optimis
tic that CampusXpress could be 
expanded to include off-campus 
use as early as next semester, 
but they were unsure of the ex
act time line.
A new program called 
BOOKSMART, which is being 
run by Student Senate, was an
nounced at the meeting. The pro
gram will allow students to offer 
their books for auction online, 
with a bidding system for inter
ested students.
Students who attended the Town 
Meeting seemed to value the fo
rum it provided for student ideas.
I went to the meeting just as a 
concerned student, said senior 
public policy and management 
major Shubo Mookeijee. There 
have been a few in the past few 
years that have been really in
teresting and informative, even 
if they were poorly attended. 
There were a lot of good ideas 
that came out. OLR was the main 
one, but there were others. Some
times its hard to see it, but things 
change. Spring Break wasnt 
moved because of students. The 
UC stayed open [at night] be
cause of students. Overall, the 
administration is willing to lis
ten. Sometimes they cant do 
everything to get student input, 
but they listen.
Memorial ceremony 
honors ex-president
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
It was more like a family re
union than a memorial service. 
Thats how Carnegie Mellon 
President Jared Cohon de
scribed the gathering at last 
weeks tribute to Richard M. 
Cyert, CMU professor emeri
tus and sixth president of the 
University. There was not a 
seat vacant in McConomy Au
ditorium as Cyerts extended 
family reflected upon his char
acter, work ethic, love of the 
Pirates, and, most of all, his 
lifelong dedication to Carnegie 
Mellon University.
Cyert passed away last month 
after a battle with cancer. The 
Cyert family and CMU admin
istration coordinated a memo
rial service for the former presi
dent that was held last Mon
day, November 9. Among those 
in attendance were Pittsburgh 
mayor Tom Murphy, Pirates 
owner Kevin McClatchy, Chief 
Financial Officer of CMU un
der Cyert Fred Rogers, various 
CMU faculty, and members of 
the Cyert family.
Cohon saidthatwhile the fam
ily appreciated how many people 
wanted to speak of their remem
brances of Cyert, it was impos
sible to accommodate all of them. 
Instead, eight people were cho
sen to give short recollections of 
Cyert, including Cohon and one 
of Cyerts daughters. Anyone 
else who wanted to share a 
memory of Cyert was encour
aged to write it on one of the
notecards passed out at the be
ginning of the service.
The memorial service began 
with the Phillips String 
Quartets performance of Alle
gro moderator from String 
Quartet in D Major opus 65, no. 
5 by Joseph Haydn, followed by 
opening remarks from Cohon. 
He was followed by James 
March, a colleague of Cyerts 
who reflected upon Cyerts un
ending love for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and his struggle with 
the illness that ended his life.
When Dick was diagnosed with 
cancer, the rest of us wept, but he 
marched forward, said March.
My father was always a hero, 
but Fve never felt prouder of my 
father than at this moment, said 
Martha Cyert, who spoke after 
March. Through all of us, he 
will live on, and we will be Dick 
Cyerts true legacy.
Others remarked on Cyerts 
softer side.
This year I lost two fathers, 
said Maurice Falk University 
Professor of Statistics and So
cial Sciences Stephen Fienberg. 
Both had cancer, and both 
exemplified dignity.
The service ended with a 
postlude by the Phillips String 
Quartet and a video of pictures 
spanning Cyerts lifetime. The 
Cyert family received those who 
attended the memorial service 
in Rangos Ballroom following 
the conclusion of the video.
Dick, we will not let you 
down, said Cohon in his final 
remarks. Your legacy will five 
forever.Group accepts charitable donations in effort to help others
By SRINIVAS PULLELA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Dont know what to do with 
those clothes youve outgrown? 
Have a few extra dollars in your 
dining account that you havent 
spent yet? How about making a 
contribution to the Whatever 
Drive. The Whatever Drive, or
ganized by Circle K, is a service 
project intended to collect sup
plies for the homeless and needy.
Circle K is a national organiza
tion dedicated to fostering the 
ideals of service, leadership, and 
fellowship among its members.
Were all about helping the 
community, said John 
Hinrichsen, sophomore math 
major and secretary of Circle K. 
A lot of people have donated, 
and were thankful.
The Carnegie Mellon chapter 
of Circle K regularly organizes 
volunteer work in the Pittsburgh 
community. Recent projects have 
included painting windows at a 
childrens hospital and harvest
ing vegetables for a local food 
bank.
The Whatever Drive began on 
November 1 and was originally 
started as an effort to gather items
for the homeless in Pittsburgh. 
The reason the drive is called the 
Whatever Drive is because stu
dents are encouraged to contrib
ute anything they can. Recently, 
however, the focus of the drive has 
shifted toward aiding relief efforts 
in Honduras and Nicaragua, 
where a hurricane recently killed 
thousands and left thousands 
more without food and shelter.
Were taking anything people 
can give: food, clothing, toys, 
board games, or whatever else 
people can donate, said Sarah 
Castaldo, a junior in information 
decision systems and president
of Circle K. Some of the specific 
items in great need in Honduras 
and Nicaragua are new blankets, 
soap, toothbrushes, shampoo, and 
combs. However, all other contri
butions are welcome, and will be 
donated to charity organizations 
in Pittsburgh.
Collection boxes have been 
placed in every dormitory except 
off-campus buildings. For the past 
three weeks, Castaldo has made 
daily trips to several dormitories 
to pick up donations from boxes. 
The drive has fared well so far, 
and the timing was right.
We wanted to do it before it got
cold, and the holidays hit, and 
people went home, said Castaldo. 
Up to this point, fifteen boxes of 
clothing, three boxes of food, and 
several other boxes of miscella
neous supplies have been collected.
In addition to putting boxes in 
dorms at Carnegie Mellon, Circle K 
distributed flyers to residents of 
Shadyside, informing them of the 
drive. Their contributions will be 
coll ected next week and will supple
ment the donations already col
lected on campus. Hinrichsen 
stressed the importance of raising 
community awareness.
People in CMU live in a rather
sheltered environment. I think 
its good that we are realizing 
that problems exist and that were 
taking action.
Boxes are being removed from 
dormitories this Sunday, making 
this week the last opportunity for 
students to contribute to the 
drive. Organizers are encourag
ing everyone to think twice be
fore they throw out that old pair 
of jeans or let those extra dining 
dollars go to waste. Instead, they 
urge students to make use of the 
opportunity to help out the less 
fortunate this winter, by donat
ing to the Whatever Drive.

U.S. faces off with Iraq after threats
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)  Iraqs let
ter welcoming back U.N. arms in
spectors means any attack carried 
out by the United States would 
amount to naked aggression with
out legal grounds, an Iraqi official 
said Sunday.
The Iraqi letter, sent Saturday to 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 
said the government of President 
Saddam Hussein was reversing deci
sions taken in August and October to 
halt cooperation with the inspectors.
President Clintons National Secu
rity Adviser, Sandy Berger, described 
it as failing to meet American condi
tions by being neither unequivocal nor 
unconditional and said a punishing 
military strike remained an option.
The U.N. Security Council adjourned 
late Saturday after five hours of incon
clusive discussion and scheduled a 
further session on Sunday.
Khudeir ad-Duleimi, acting direc
tor of external information and edi
tor of the state-run Baghdad Ob
server, told Associated Press Televi
sion News that Iraqs letter deprived 
the United States of any pretext to 
commit its aggression.
If they want to launch an aggres
sion, it would be a naked aggression 
without any political or legal justifica
tion, he said.
U.N. sanctions were imposed after 
Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait in 
1990, sparking war in the Persian 
Gulf. They limit the sale of oil and 
other trade dealings and have devas
tated the Iraqi economy.
The Security Council has said the 
sanctions will not be lifted until the 
U.N. Special Commission and the In
ternational Atomic Energy Agency 
certify that Iraq is free of weapons of 
mass destruction.
Editorials Sunday in state-run 
newspapers said the United States 
was seeking any opportunity to at
tack Iraq.
All front pages carried the text of the 
letter to Annan, along with photos of
Saddam meeting with his Revolution
ary Command Council and the leader
ship of the ruling Baath party, which 
approved the letter.
Al-Thawra, the newspaper pub
lished by the Baath party, said the 
leaderships decision pulled the car
pet out from under the American ad
ministration, which continues to 
present misleadinginformation about 
Iraq ... and hunts continuously for 
opportunities to start an aggression. 
It accused the United States of at
tempting to destabilize security and 
safety in the region and blackmail 
Arab countries to support its threats.
Babil, which is published by 
Saddams son Odai, said the American 
threats of a military strike were seen 
by Iraqis as a cruel joke.
. Also Sunday, a U.N. spokesman in 
Baghdad said a decision was reversed 
to send back to Iraq about 150 U.N. 
humanitarian workers pulled out last 
week for fear of a U.S. attack.
Their return was announced Fri
day in New York after initial reports 
about Iraqs letter. But spokesman 
Eric Fait said the workers  who 
help run food distribution to the Iraqi 
people  would stay out because of 
the extended deliberations in the 
Security Council.
Fearing possible airstrikes, Moscow 
began withdrawing some Russian per
sonnel from Baghdad on Sunday, a 
government spokesman said.
More than 100 people, mostly em
ployees of the Russian embassy in Iraq 
and some of their family members, left 
by bus for the city of Kermanshah in 
Iran, the duty officer at the Emergency 
Situations Ministry said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright will cut short 
her visit to the 21-member Asia-Pa
cific Economic Cooperation forum in 
Malaysia, State Department officials 
said Sunday.
Albright was to head back to Wash
ington Sunday night to deal with the 
situation with Iraq,
Witness criticizes 
browser bundling
WASHINGTON (AP)  Consumers 
are being hurt by Microsofts decision to 
bundle its Internet software within the 
Windows operating system, claims a 
government witness in the software 
giants antitrust trial.
In written testimony released Friday, 
computer consultant Glenn Weadock 
contends that the pairing provides few 
benefits and instead causes confusion, 
security risks, and other unwanted prob
lems for people.
Hurt the most are users who would 
prefer to use a browser, which lets people 
view the Internet, other than the one 
made by Microsoft, maintained Weadock, 
who is scheduled to take the witness 
stand Monday.
Microsoft called the testimony a collec
tion of opinions, not a statement of fact.
Weadock said that users could remove 
Microsofts browser from computers that 
ran on previous versions of Windows but 
they dont have the same option for com
puters using the newest version, Win
dows 98.
The forced inclusion of Internet Ex
plorer with Windows 98... forces organi
zations to either forgo new technology, 
incur the costs of supporting two brows
ers or removing the unwanted one, or 
alter their choice of browsers, said 
Weadock, president of the Golden, Colo.- 
based Independent Software Inc.
Microsoft took issue with how Weadock 
based his views on a series of interviews 
he conducted with computer managers of 
large companies and various memos and 
sworn depositions.
Elderly skydiver 
jumps to death
ORANGE, Va. (AP)  A 71-year-old 
skydiver who had completed thousands 
of successful jumps plunged to his 
death when his parachute failed to 
open Saturday.
William Kenny jumped with two 
friends from a Skydive Orange plane at 
13,000 feet. After his main chute and a 
reserve failed to open, his body was 
found in a wooded area east of state 
Highway 631, said State Police spokes
woman Lucy Caldwell. Both of his companions landed safely.
Ric Dennis, club safety officer at 
Skydive Orange, said mechanical fail
ure apparently caused the chute to fail. 
He said it also appeared that Kenny did 
not use emergency measures designed 
to open the parachute after a mechani
cal failure.
An autopsy was planned to determine 
if Kenny may have suffered a medical 
emergency that could have prevented 
him from opening his parachute.
Kenny had jumped almost5,000times 
since the 1960s, Caldwell said.
Violence marks 
APEC gathering
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  
Thousands of protesters flooded the 
streets of the Malaysian capital demand
ing an end to the 17-year rule of Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, as the 
United States and other Pacific Rim 
countries rejected his recipe for dealing 
with the global financial crisis.
In a string of setbacks for Asias long
est serving ruler, the United States an
nounced that President Clinton was can
celing his trip to the summit because of 
the tense standoff with Iraq over U.N. 
weapons inspections.
Gore, who will arrive Monday morn
ing, will represent Clinton at the sum
mit of 21 nations of the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum. U.S. offi
cials said the president still hoped to 
make scheduled visits later in the week 
to Japan and South Korea if the situa
tion in Iraq allows it.
Even without Clintons presence, the 
U.S. side was carrying the day in setting 
the agenda for the action plan APEC 
will adopt to respond to the regions 
worst financial crisis in 50 years.
The draft of a final communiqu for the 
APEC leaders supported Clintons pro
posals to increase social programs to help 
millions of Asians who were plunged into 
poverty by the steep economic downturns.
Protesters have been calling for 
Mahathirs ouster following the firing 
and subsequent jailing of his one-time 
protege and now political rival, former 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
On Saturday, 3,000 nti-government 
demonstrators, chanting Clinton arrest 
Mahathir, Clinton save us from 
Mahathir, marched close to the down
town hotel where U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was staying and 
where the rest of the White House del
egation will stay.
A defiant Mahathir has defended the 
sacking of Anwar, who is now on trial for 
what he and his supporters contend are 
trumped up charges of corruption and 
sexual misconduct.
But Clinton and a number of other 
leaders have refused the customary cour
tesy calls on the host of the APEC sum
mit, and Canadian Foreign Minister 
Lloyd Axworthy invited Anwars wife to 
lunch on Saturday.
Its important that these meetings 
take into account seriously the changes 
going on, and impact on the Malaysian 
people, Axworthy told reporters after 
the luncheon.
Mahathir has blamed Asias troubles 
on foreign currency speculators and in
competent policies by the International 
Monetary Fund. In September, he 
banned trading of the Malaysian cur
rency outside the country and imposed 
controls on foreigners trying to pull in
vestments out of Malaysia.
Hawaii plans to 
irradiate fruit crop
WASHINGTON ( AP)Plans to build 
a plant on Hawaiis Big Island to irradi
ate the areas bountiful tropical fruit 
crop have caused heated debate among 
island residents.
The plant, approved by voter referen
dum in this months elections, would 
give the area an economic boost by al
lowing treatment of more of the islands 
fruit, supporters say.
Opponents say the plant is too much of 
a risk. They say unease about irradiated 
fruit has not been assuaged with con
sumers, and they dont want Hawaiis 
agriculture to be stigmatized.
On the mainland, supporters tout the 
soon-to-be-built plant as a major step in 
the push towards irradiation.
The industry saw this as a bench
mark, said Gene Grabowski, spokes
man for the Washington-based Grocery 
Manufacturers of America, which spon
sored ads on the Big Island in support 
of irradiation. This was like Waterloo 
and Gettysburg. If the anti-irradiation 
forces would have prevailed in Hawaii, 
they could have used that as a symbol 
in efforts to stop food irradiation in 
other states.Letter to Annan, along with photos of situation with Iraq._________________ woman Lucy Caldwell. Both of his comtownhotelwhereU.S.SecretaryofState other states.Several states reach agreement with tobacco companies
NEW YORK (AP)  Big Toof the documents to state attorThe industry payments, which Four states  Mississippi, common with settlements, would pay about $100 million overNEW YORK (AP)  Big To
bacco would pay $206 billion to 
settle the remaining state claims 
over the costs of treating sick 
smokers under an agreement 
reached Saturday with negotia
tors for eight states, the Washing
ton state attorney general said.
The settlement proposal, which 
would salvage parts of a broader 
tobacco agreementthat diedin Con
gress earlier this year, would also 
place new limits on how tobacco 
makers market their products.
Negotiators for the nations 
'four biggest tobacco companies 
and eight state attorneys gen
eral completed their review of 
the agreement Saturday after
noon. They were shipping copies
of the documents to state attor
neys general across the country 
for their approval.
We have finished, said Attor
ney General Christine M. 
Gregoire of Washington state, 
who led the states team during 
more than five months of nego
tiations. We have done the best 
we can do here.
A formal announcement of de
tails of the agreement was ex
pected on Monday.
Tobacco spokesman Scott Will
iams said the industry would have 
no comment until after the an
nouncement.
If enough states embrace the 
plan, it would be the biggest U.S. 
civil settlement ever.
The industry payments, which 
will be made through the year 
2025, would reimburse the states 
for expenses under the Medicaid 
program for treating smokingrelated illnesses and help finance 
programs and research to dis
courage smoking, especially by 
young people.
In exchange, the settlement 
would lift a huge legal and finan
cial threat that has been hanging 
over tobacco makers.
State officials have until Fri
day to agree to the deal or take 
their chances fighting the indus
try alone in court.
About three dozen states have 
filed suits, and the others also 
could qualify under the proposal.
Four states  Mississippi, 
Florida, Texas and Minnesota  
have already settled for about 
$40 billion, an amount that isnt 
reflected in the proposal.
The four major tobacco compa
nies agreeing to the settlement 
are Philip Morris Cos., R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco, Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco, and 
Lorillard Tobacco.
The negotiating states in addi
tion to Washington were Califor
nia, New York, North Carolina, 
Colorado, Oklahoma, North Da
kota, and Pennsylvania.
We have been here negotiat
ing for five months. Its not per
fect, and we didnt get everything 
that we wanted. But that is so
common with settlements, 
Gregoire said.
Fred Olson, a spokesman for 
Gregoire, said the state payments 
would range in size from $23.9 
billion for New York and Califor
nia to about $466 million for Wyo
ming. Smaller amounts would also 
go to several U.S. territories such 
as Puerto Rico and Guam.
The tobacco industry also would 
commit $1.7 billion for educating 
people about the dangers of smok
ing and discouraging youngsters 
from starting.
A separate deal was also struck 
Saturday with U.S. Tobacco Co., 
the leading maker of chewing to
bacco, Gregoire said.
Under that deal, U.S. Tobacco
would pay about $100 million over 
10 years for educational programs 
about the dangers of tobacco in ex
change for state claims settlements. 
Total payments could rise to $400 
million if other smokless tobacco 
makers join that settlement.
In addition to accepting the 
marketing limitations in the ciga
rette deal, U.S. Tobacco agreed to 
quit giving free chewing tobacco 
to baseball and other sports 
teams, Gregoire said.
Under both settlement propos
als, tobacco companies would be 
prohibited from advertising on 
billboards and buses, using car
toon characters in ads, and put
ting tobacco brand names on caps, 
bags, and other merchandise.

50 YEARS AGO, November 
23, 1948  Carnegie Mellons 
football team ended a 6-year-los

then clung greedily to their one 
touchdown lead.

Violence broke out when one of 
the outsiders tried to steal one of 
the groups guitars. The ensuing 
fight lasted several minutes and
the band Sassafras was forced to 
stop playing.
The hostilities allegedly had 
begun some time before the fight 
when one of the outsiders started 
hassling a girl who was with a 
friend of the band. A shouting 
match began and words were 
exchanged before the actual fight 
took place.

Each of the eight fratemitites

its most popular player to play on
the Greek All-Stars team in the 
hope that it would encourage a

Organizers had hoped to have

OLR lotteryj system will begin this week
The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 November 1998
RESOLUTION, from page 1
nize that they failed to talk to us about 
it, but part of [their reason] was that 
they didnt expect how strongly students 
would dislike the changes.
The letter also refutes the assertion of 
the Steering Committee that it consulted 
a number of Student Advisory Councils 
(SACs), finding that the only SAC which 
was consulted was the Vice Presidents 
SAC. It also draws attention to the late 
notice of changes provided to students. 
It reads: the current efforts of the OLR 
Steering Committee to publicize the 
changes in the registration system come 
too late for our ideas and complaints to 
be implemented for this semester. 
According to Falso, the decision to! 
not criticize the actual lottery was' 
made consciously.
The problem that we had was not wit! 
the lottery system, said Falso. 
havent had a chance to sit down and lo< 
at it, and we wanted to give it the benefit 
of the doubt to see how it works. The re; 
problem that we have is that they didnt 
sit down with us and get feedback.
The administrationhas not responded 
to the resolution yet.
I didnt read it, said Elliot. I goj it 
in my mailbox and I passed it arounfl to
people in my group, but I havent had 
Ichance to read it. [The OLR Steer
ing Committee] hasnt met in two 
eeks. Right now we are going to run 
is thing [OLR]. Were going to run it 
tomorrow, and well get feedback like
E1 9 always do.
Ng hoped that the statement would 
ive a lasting effect on both OLR and 
administrative decisions in general.
. It will set up a precedent for what 
I channels should be followed, said Ng. 
rWe will be meeting with Papinchak 
after [registration] to go over it.
- The letter was not able to change 
prevent the lottery system from be
ing implemented this semester, but 
those who wrote it hope that the ad
ministration understands student 
frustration. It concludes: The over
whelmingly negative response to 
these changes by students obligates 
us to convey their opinions to the 
administration. Many students are 
upset, as evidenced by a casual glance 
at many electronic bulletin boards 
and the deluge of email received by 
the various student representatives. 
We, as their representatives and col
lective voice, are sharing our con
cerns with you.
Crime and Incident Report
11/7 LIQUOR LAWS, 9:04 pm  A 
Campus Police officer responded to Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie Hall room A6 
to check a computer protection alarm. 
While there, he saw a CMU student 
working at a different computer. He had 
an open, brown glass bottle next to him.
After finishing the check of the com
puter, the officer saw that the student had 
placed the bottle on the floor under the 
desk. The label of the bottle read Red Dog 
Beer. The students ID proved he was of 
age. He was still in violation of CMUs 
open alcohol container policy, so the of
ficer issued him an internal citation.
11/8 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,3:07
am  Six Campus Police officers and a 
security guard were dispatched to the 
McConomy Auditorium for a disorderly 
moviegoer. The actor had not paid to see 
the movie and was throwing pennies.
One officer observed the actor leave 
the auditorium and head for the Univer
sity Center exit that faces West Wing. 
He called for the actor to stop, which he 
did. He was identified as a Hamerschlag 
House resident. The officer asked the 
actor if he had, in fact, entered the movie 
without paying and if he had been throw
ing pennies. The actor said, Yes. The 
officer issued him an internal citation 
for disorderly conduct. He explained to 
the actor the hazards of throwing ob
jects in dark theaters.
11/9 SUSPICIOUS MAIL,9:38 amA 
Civil Engineering administrator called 
Campus Police to report that she had re
ceived an odd piece of mail. She said that 
last month she sent a poster to the Univer
sity ofKentucky advertising the CMU Civil 
Engineeringprogram. The poster had busi
ness reply postcards attached to it.
Last week she said she received a 
business envelope with one of the post
cards taped onto it. The envelope con
tained tw.o blank 8x11 sheets of paper. 
In the center of one of the sheets was a 
red checker. Aside from the postmark 
from Lexington, Kentucky, there was no 
marking on the envelope or on the sheets 
of paper. She said that she felt uneasy 
that someone would go through the 
trouble to mail the letter. The enve
lope was placed into evidence.
11/11 CRIMINAL MISCHIEFJ.2:36 
pm  Several complainants called Cam
pus Police saying that gun shots may 
have been fired in Wean Hall. One officer 
responded to the scene, as did another 
officer who was already in Wean on an 
unrelated call. One of the officers went 
into the stairwell and saw two destroyed 
computer monitors. They appeared to 
have been dropped several stories through 
the middle of the stairwell. The monitors 
serial numbers had been removed.
The officers checked the area for any 
witnesses. CPS was notified to clean up
the computers.
11/12 ASSAULT^ :44 am  A Carn
egie Mellon student had been drinking 
at Panther Hollow Inn. After last call, he 
stepped out of the tavern and into the 
brisk night. A tall, white male, whom 
the student did not know, approached 
him and asked why he had been talking 
about him inside the bar. The male then 
punched the student in the face, causing 
damage to his jaw.
The victim went to a friends room and 
called Campus Police for medical assis
tance. CMU EMS evaluated him, and an 
officer took him to Presbyterian Hospital.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
Lapaglia reviews all reports prior to 
release.
Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the editor in chief, 
the news editor, and the staffwriter 
typing the report.
All personal names. of complain
ants, victims, suspects, and fraternity 
names are omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other 
personal details are given only in the 
context of complete descriptions.
Not every incident that occurs ap
pears in the report.

of architectural education and 
practice. This organization is 
open to all undergraduate and 
graduate students of CMU.
Motion was approved by 
voice vote.
F98-022-Special Allocation to 
Ultimate Frisbee Club. Ultimate 
Frisbee requests a spcial allo
cation of $2,400. The Ultimate 
Frisbee Club applied for fund
ing at the end of last year as
suming that we would continue 
to function as we always have: 
with one team. Incredible inter
est in the club this year has led 
to multiple teams. We currently 
have 2 mens teams and 1
womens team. The special allo
cation that they are requesting 
will go mainly to tournament 
entrance fees and a small 
amount will go to extra discs. 
F&R Committee recommends a 
special allocation of $1,800. This 
based on an estimate of 11 tour
naments remaining in the year.
The motion was approved by 
hand vote (22 in favor, 1 opposed).
F98-023-Special Allocation to 
Student Alumni Relation Coun
cil, During Oct. 1316, SARC 
held a series of events, special 
guests, and giveaways to cel
ebrate Homecoming. The total 
cost of Spirit Week came to 
slightly over $4,000. They were 
budgeted $400 for this event, and 
have received an additional 
$1,500 from the Office of Alumni 
Relations. Still short of some 
$2,263.41, SARC requests a spe
cial allocation of $2,000. They do 
have additional fundraising 
planned. F&R recommends a 
special allocation of $1,500. The 
special allocation for SARC was 
changed from $1,500 to $1,172. 
Motion was approved by hand 
vote (19 in favor, 2 opposed).
F98-024-Roll-over Account for 
University Rowing Club. The 
Rowing Club would like to pur
chase a new boat costing some 
$12,000. They have raised about 
$4,000 already and they antici
pate being able to raise the funds 
needed within the next two years. 
However, the current accounting 
system at CMU dictates that no 
balance can be carried from year 
to year. Therefore, what they need 
is a Roll Over Account.
With a special account code 
designated within their current 
account, any balance left in at 
the end of each year would be 
funneled back at the start of the 
new year.
Motion was approved by voice 
vote.
F98-025-Implementation of 
BOOKSMART. Represented by 
Robb Moskowitz, BOOKSMART 
is an online, Web-basedbook auc
tion that is proposed to be hosted 
by Student Senate on the new 
Senate PC. Implementation of 
BOOKSMART will mean host
ing the program on the Senate 
PC and spending almost $900. 
$60 will go to buy a server-based 
email program, and the rest will 
go entirely into marketing 
BOOKSMART.

Letters to the Editoi
Whether it be the Career Days 
that the School of Design hosts 
for its majors or seminars about 
how physics majors should go 
about applying to graduate school, 
CMU colleges and departments 
that go above and beyond aca
demic training by providing their 
students with valuable life guid
ance should be commended. While 
the Career Center helps students 
with their job searches, individual 
departments have more personal 
contact' with students and can 
therefore better help them make 
decisions regarding their futures.
The School of Designs Career 
Days program is the perfect ex
ample of how an individual de
partment can give important, spe
cialized guidance to students. For 
the two days comprising Career 
Days, junior and senior design 
students have the opportunity to 
show their work to representa
tives from prominent design 
firms, as well as make valuable 
connections. In addition, the 
School of Design offers workshops 
on resume writing. While the 
Career Center holds a similar pro
gram, a design student can re
ceive expert advice from profes
sors who have experience in re
viewing and submitting design 
resumes if he or she attends this 
Design-sponsored workshop.
For those students who opt to 
attend graduate school after CMU 
instead of joining the work force,
Following a national trend of 
tuition increases above the rate of 
inflation, CMU has increased its 
tuition almost yearly, with the 
current price tag to attend the 
University totaling $21,275. Last 
year, the CMU Board of Trustees 
voted to increase tuition 4.9 per
cent, almost double the rate of 
inflation. This year, the Trustees 
should make every effort not to 
raise tuition, and especially not 
beyond inflation, since a tuition 
hike is not necessary for the Uni
versity to maintain its current 
rate of growth.
The Trustees decision is made 
with the help of recommendations 
from President Cohon and the 
Undergraduate Tuition Commit
tee, which seeks student input 
every year. This year, the admin
istration is holding a meeting in 
early December for concerned 
parents and students regarding 
tuition. The fiscal health of CMU 
is an obvious concern for every
one in the campus community. 
According to Carnegie Mellons 
financial statements from recent 
years, the University is in strong 
financial shape. CMU offsets more 
than 40 percent of the full tuition 
through financial aid. This shows a 
commitment from the administra
tion to its students, but these mon
ies are largely taken into account 
when examining net assets.
In the 1995-1996 annual state
ment, Carnegie Mellon declared 
an increase of $18,224,000 in net 
assets from operations, a portion 
of which stems from an increase 
in tuition. The 1996-1997 state
ment shows that .CMUs net as
sets from operations increased to
some schools and departments 
offer specialized seminars on what 
to expect when going through this 
process. Those in the Physics de
partment have it a little easier 
than most, as the administration 
organizes meetings with faculty 
where students can ask questions 
about all aspects of graduate edu
cation. Copies of GREs from pre
vious years are also available for 
students to study so they know 
what to expect during their 
graduate school testing. Such of
ferings are important because 
they eliminate the difficulty in 
finding specific post-graduate 
study information.
Also, many departments such 
as English and history allow some 
students to take graduate courses 
within their majors. By getting a 
taste of what a graduate class is 
all about, students can better de
cide whether they want to 
continue their academic career 
after CMU.
Clearly administrators should 
first be concerned with educating 
students in order to equip 
them for what they face after 
graduation. But those depart
ments and colleges that go be
yond teaching and offer different 
forms of guidance for undergradu
ates should be commended. Stu
dents in these programs can 
readily benefit from the experi
ences of professionals in their 
own field.
more than $24 million. Total net 
assets for the University during 
this year increased by more than 
$111 million to more than $1.25 
billion. Also, in both of these peri
ods, the endowmentcharitable 
contributions made since the 
Universitys founding  has 
grown to almost $582 million, ac
cording to CMUs 1996-1997 An
nual Report. CMU invests some 
of its endowment in stocks and 
bonds. Instead of spending the 
profits of those investments, the 
University has directly re-invested 
more than two-thirds of the return 
back into the endowment. This ef
fective way of making part of the 
endowment earn more money is 
another reason why a tuition in
crease is not necessary.
The Universitys financial 
health has allowed it to grow and 
expand at a time when students 
have been seeking broader edu
cational opportunities here at 
CMU. However, if anything, the 
numbers show that the Univer
sity has the ability to expand its 
programs without increasing the 
burden placed on students.
Not raising tuition is one very 
effective way that Carnegie 
Mellon can distinguish itself from 
other universities of its caliber. 
Naturally, expansion of CMUs 
academic programs to meet those 
of its competitors is a priority, as 
is growing the endowment. How
ever each should be done with a 
minimal burden on students. Ex
tending that courtesy will only 
bring more top students to CMU, 
further ensuring its place as 
a leading educational and re
search institution.
Student criticizes 
focus of editorial
Editor:
It still amazes me 
that after my threeand-a-half years at 
CMU, The Tartans 
Editorial Board still 
cant get their head out 
of their collective ass. 
But with last weeks inane editorials I 
had no choice but to put pen to paper.
As the main newspaper for the CMU 
community, one would hope The Tartan 
would feel some sort of responsibility in 
its weekly column to highlight the seri
ous issues and shortcomings facing 
the University.
Instead, the Editorial Board would 
rather squander this responsibility so 
they can whine about their personal 
gripes and petty complaints.
In last weeks issue, The Tartan ran a 
front-page article about student com
plaints to changes in OLR. Student Sen
ate and SDC passed resolutions about 
the lack of student input into these 
changes. Yet no mention is made in 
the Editorials about this highly conten
tious issue.
So many other issues face this campus 
that The Tartan completely ignores: Why 
do students have to call Campus Police 
for maintenance problems after busi
ness hours? Why doesnt FMS run a 24- 
hour maintenance hotline?
Why are students forced to deal with 
deferred maintenance and poor housing 
conditions?
Why has the administration repeatedly failed to solicit student input on 
highly important issues? (spring 
break, OLR.)
Instead of addressing serious issues 
such as these, The Tartan would rather 
decry the lack of pizza at 4 am. This lack 
of attention to these issues speaks to a 
failure by the Editorial Board to take 
their responsibilities seriously. The Edi
torial Board needs to reevaluate their 
priorities to determine how they can 
best serve the student body.

[Ed. note: The resolution passed by Student Senate and SDC did not come about until this past Wednesday and therefore
was well after The Tartans production deadline of last Sunday night. The article we did run, however, dealt extensively with Senate leadersreactions to the OLR Steering Committees actions.Also, in the past year alone, The Tartans Editorial Board has, in fact, addressed the issues that Mr. Anthe feels are worthwhile.For The Tartans stance on campus maintenance problems, please see: Housing must ensure apartment conditions, Volume 93, Issue 4, September 21,1998.For The Tartans stance on how administrators should treat student input, please see: Administration must consider student input, Volume 92, Issue 19, March 9, 1998.And for The Tartans stance on the administrations changes to OLR, please see: Registration process still needs improvement, Volume 93, Issue 9, November 2, 1998.All of these editorials have been published within the past calendar year and express the views of the current Editorial Board.

UC officials want 
artwork returned
Editor:
We are very sad
dened that a member 
or guest of the campus 
community saw fit to 
remove an artistic 
sketch hanging in the 
University Center. We have engaged in 
a concerted effort over the past several 
months to highlight student and faculty 
art throughout the building. Many fac
ulty and students have volunteered to 
show their works, undoubtedly without 
a concern that this might put them at 
risk. Someone has violated that trust, 
and it is likely others witnessed the 
event or have subsequently become 
aware of it. If you are able to effect the 
return of this piece of a sketch depicting 
Lili Vanessi  Kiss Me Kate  from a 
larger set of 12 displayed, we would 
appreciate it.
If found, please return the art work to 
the University Center Information Desk, 
or the Security Office at 4902 Forbes 
Avenue  no questions asked.

Clusters  director 
replies to critique
Editor:
Last week, The Tar
tan ran an editorial 
that criticized Clus
ter Services [Cluster 
th'0 Editor Services needs better 
management, 11/9].
Some aspects of the editorial were ac
curate, such as the fact that there are 
fewer students working as CCons this 
year than there have been'in recent years 
past. Certain other aspects of the edito
rial were inaccurate and also unbalanced 
in their presentation of the situation. For 
example, all CCons participate in a man
datory Iraining program, including train
ing in customer service; there is an ongo
ing program for CCon merit raises to 
reward good performance and develop
ment of technical skills.
Rather than focusing on individual 
points of,the editorial, I encourage cluster 
users who have complaints or suggestions 
to send inail to clusters+@andrew, the 
official email address for the clusters. 
Alternatively, feel free to contact Pomona 
Valero, Cluster Services manager, Meena 
Lakhavani, User Services manager, or 
myself. Whenever possible, we will con
sider adjustments to our service that can 
help address those issues. For example, 
we hope toreschedule the installation of 
new printers so that they can be in place 
before the end of the current semester.
In closing, I want to point out that 
there are a great number of highly dedi
cated individuals who support the cam
pus computing clusters: the CCons, the 
individual student cluster managers, the 
full-time stalf who manage the collec
tive cluster facilities and services, and 
the associated groups within Comput
ing Services who keep the hardware and 
software up and running. While I havent 
worked with every one of these individu
als, the many with whom I have inter
acted are hard-working and genuinely 
interested in supporting and helping to 
improve the computing environment on 
campus. Sharing your observations and 
suggestions with the cluster manage
ment will help to insure those many 
individuals are working in ways that 
best support the campus needs.

Ex-wrestler knocks down political status quo
Robert Jefferson
Last week, the political 
world was shaken. Jesse The 
Body Ventura, probably most 
famous for being a wrestler in 
the 80s, was elected the new 
governor of Minnesota. While 
that in and of itself is an 
achievement, what is more 
unusual is that he was a mem
ber of the Reform Party, that 
group best known for having 
H. Ross Perot as their frontrunner in the 1992 and 1996 
Presidential races.
With this victory, the Re
form Party has not only 
thrown assumptions about 
them into question, but has 
also shown third-party poli
tics as a force to be reckoned 
-with. Previously, it was a 
near-certainty that major po
litical posts would be held only 
by either Democrats or Re
publicans. Independent poli
tics in the late twentieth cen
tury have mostly been inef
fectual at best; though by 
1992, the fact that Perot man
aged to gain some of the vote
in a Presidential race caused 
many a head to turn.
Perhaps this is the next step 
in showingthat independence 
still has a chance in this bi
partisan culture. However, it 
would be remiss to just accept 
this as simple fact. Further, 
one should not ask, Why 
hasnt this occurred before? 
but more importantly, What 
happened that would cause 
this to happen?
For a moment, let us dis
count the possibility of voter 
apathy aiding Venturas vic
tory. While such disaffection 
is rampant in society today, it
tends to cause few aberrations 
in votipg patterns. Instead, 
voters tend to pick the status 
quo, or something not entirely 
different. A major factor in 
his winning could be a grow
ing dissatisfaction with the 
two main parties.
Whether by design or by 
accident, the Republicans 
have shot themselves in their 
collective foot this election. 
The biggest (and obvious) rea
son is the backlash over the 
Lewinsky case. Theres a dif
ference between the mere pur

CMU shuttle service takes students for a ride
Editors Notebook
by Lorelei Laird
The way I see it, the shuttle service 
owes me $1.25.
Thats how much it cost me to take the 
bus home last week when the shuttle 
didnt come for over an hour, abandoning 
my groceries and me in the freezing wind 
outside Food Gallery. When the first one 
didnt show up, I thought that perhaps I 
had somehow missed it. So I waited. And 
waited. And after about an hour and a 
half (three shuttles worth of time) of 
melting orange juice and visions of home
work undone, I gave up and hailed a 
passing PAT bus, getting home just in 
time to leave again for a meeting.
I could go on, but Im sure you all have 
your own gripes. Personal complaints aside, 
this story illustrates some of the major 
problems with CMUs shuttle service. 
Though its a valuable resource, there are 
big problems that occasionallyor maybe 
not so occasionally  negate that value.
For starters, its a hit-or-miss service at 
best. There is absolutely nothing in the 
shuttle schedule to tell you when it reaches 
a specific stop, and only a vague idea of 
where it will stop. Even assuming that all 
students know where S. Negley Avenue at 
Elmer Street is, which comer is it? Where 
is it in relation to other stops? Furthermore, 
students are expected to actively hail the 
drivers when they want to get on or off of
the shuttle, an expec_________________
tation unlike that 
of most public 
transporation sys
tems and which is not 
made known to 
shuttle riders. This 
lack of clarity can 
cause riders to miss 
their stops or miss the
shuttle altogether. And all of this is assum
ing that the shuttle is going to be on time (or 
come at all!), which is rare. These are not 
trivial concerns for those who depend on the 
shuttle service to get where they need to go.
Furthermore, the system is inefficient. 
Every day, before the AB route stops and 
the B route begins, I see a big white school 
bus with Carnegie Mellon painted on the 
front, waiting idly in the Morewood turn
around for the B route to begin. Meanwhile, 
students are cramming themselves into the
Though its a valuable

Romantic stories bring false hopes
Yishan Wong
As many people are aware, 
there has been a sudden explo
sion in the prevalence of vio
lently gory, even crass, video 
games. At the same time, we 
see more and more violence on 
television. Quite predictably, 
we can expect impressionable 
young children to be most af
fected by this, especially since 
televised media is fast becom
ing the dominant form of enter
tainment and education for 
youth. There are some who 
would say that violence in the 
media is responsible for the 
growing desensitization of 
people to violence, and that they 
bear some fault for the recent 
schoolyard shooting incidents.
But is this all that the media 
is desensitizing us to? I say 
there is too much love and ro
mance depicted in the media. 
How many couples does a child 
see meet, fall in love, and live 
happily ever after on television 
or in a movie, by the time they 
are 18? Theres no national task 
force keeping statistics on this, 
but if there were, Ill bet theyd 
say it was a whole lot. What 
does this do to children, grow
ing up in a world where love is 
depicted as commonplace, as if 
youll meet that special some
one on the way to grocery store?
Consider the recent movie As Good As It Gets, where a 50- 
year-old obsessive-compulsive 
man and single-mom waitress 
meet and fall in love. Such mov
ies present impressionable 
youth with a skewed view of the 
world and the frequency of love. 
In the real world, no one goes
for single-mothers, especially 
ones with a sick kid. And who 
could possibly love a racist, ho
mophobic, cranky old man with 
a mental disorder? People dont 
fall in love with someone de
spite their faults just because of 
some endearing characteristic; 
people fall in love with perfect 
supermodels and teen 
heartthrobs. And of course, be
cause there arent enough of 
those to go around, most people 
end up settling for someone 
good enough and end up living 
the rest of their lives trying to 
fool themselves into thinking 
they love the person. This is the 
harsh reality that is glossed over 
by Hollywood and NBC, in favor 
of misinforming children that 
love happens everywhere, that 
deep down, everyone just wants 
to be loved and will one day 
find that perfect person. This 
simply isnt true. Some of us 
merely thirst for power and 
world domination.
Can we stand idly by and let 
the youth of this nation go on 
believing that people will fall in 
love regardless of social class, 
as depicted in the blockbuster 
movie Titanic? In this movie, 
Leonardo DiCaprios character, 
a poor farm boy, falls in love 
with Kate Winslet, a filthy rich 
cultured princess. What made 
Winslets character think for a 
moment that DiCaprio wouldnt 
turn out to be just another oaf
ish, unsophisticatedyokel whod 
leave her the moment she 
lost her nubile beauty? She al
ready had a rich fianc, but 
leaves him for this uncultured 
ruffian? Are we to allow chil
dren to grow up thinking that if 
they are nice enough and goodlooking enough like Leonardo 
DiCaprio, they can charm
away even a rich scioness from 
her betrothed?
Love does not happen like it 
does in the movies. If you were 
a farm boy coming back to 
America on the Titanic, what 
would most likely happen would 
be that youd sit in your thirdclass cabin most of the time, 
maybe get a little something to 
eat, spend some time on the ob
servation deck, and then go back 
to your cabin to get some rest. 
And then you would hear this 
loud, booming sound of the ice 
tearing open the lower forward 
compartments, and a few hours 
later, you would die drowning in 
the icy waters of the North At
lantic because there werent 
enough lifeboats. This is what 
we do not tell our children  
that you will probably never 
find love, but instead will die 
alone and shivering in cold wa
ter due to an engineering over
sight. And there will probably 
be sharks.
Because of blunders like that, 
hundreds of people die in airline 
accidents each year, and most of 
them die single and probably 
did not meet their perfect mate 
on the plane shortly before the 
crash. No, the media misleads 
children into believing that love 
happens to everyone, and that 
romance is everywhere. This is 
not true, and unless we want to 
live in a nation of hopeless ro
mantics, we must take a stand 
now and tell children, Youll 
probably die alone or married to 
someone you can barely toler
ate, that love is rare and some
thing to be treasured, not found 
around every corner.
Yishan Wong says that you should tell her how you feel, or shell never know.
A lot of these problems arent necessarily 
due to deliberate sloth or blatant incompe
tence, but rather seem to come from a lack 
of familiarity with and attention paid to 
the system. Shuttle is run by Escort, who in 
turn are run by the Campus Police. Now, 
while I can see that Escort, being a noctur
nal service, has some affinity with the 
police due to the hours that both must 
keep, their organizational goals arent ex
actly the same. The police concern them
selves with keeping the place safe; theyre 
probably not trained as transportation sys
tem administrators, and as a result, they 
may not know what exactly the users of 
such a system need. With this in mind, why 
not make Escort its own little department, 
perhaps within the Campus Police depart
ment, Housing or Student Affairs? The 
expenditure would be minimal, and spe
cializing its goals can only help improve it.
CMU could probably live without a shuttle 
service  its not as essential to a good, 
education as, say, light and heat in the 
classrooms. However, I think its good that 
we have one, and that since we do, we should 
do our best to make sure its a good one. After 
all, its useless if no one can use it.

and Ken Starrs published report, 
featuring lurid details of the 
Presidents sexual exploits. The 
public, no matter how little credit 
it is given, knows the difference 
between investigation and exploiAB route minibuses, which often get so 
overcrowded that students have to stand in 
the aisles, where there is dangerously little 
to hold on to, making it difficult to enter or 
exit the bus easily and sometimes causing 
students to miss their stops because they 
cant see where they are. When the B route 
starts, on the other hand, it generally has a 
grand total of five passengers. Could it be so 
difficult to switch the buses? And then

shuttle route is ba
sically a big loop, 
starting in Oak

ing as far as South 
Negley Ave. in 
Shadyside. Thats 
a lot of space to 
cover, and respect must be given to the 
shuttle system for being able to cover it in 30 
minutes. However, the route is convoluted 
in such a way that it actually loops back on 
itself, taking almost 30 minutes to reach, for 
example, Cathedral Mansions  a 10- 
minute walk from Morewood Gardens. Es

ual shift alienates more than a 
few people.
When the two major parties no 
longer represent the people as 
was their original function, but 
instead become self-serving, the 
people look for someone new to

the Presidents rating did not de
viate much from the average over 
the past six years. Such an act 
was an effective means of drag
ging down party credibility.
On the other hand, the Demo

in forestalling Clintons poten

perpetual darlings of the publics 
eye, either. Not only are people 
somewhat distrustful of the en

questionable track record in his 
personal life, but many Demo

enough people in Minnesota were 
disillusioned by the proffered 
platforms that they disregarded

unlikeliest of candidates.
The Democrats and Republi
cans should consider this victory 
not as the end of the world for 
them, or the beginning of ram
pant madness across the coun

call. Their complacency has made 
the people restless, and indepen

On the mens side, sophomores Jason 
Striner and Nathan Palm in the 200m 
breaststroke accomplished the teams 
only 1-2 finish of the meet. The two also 
finished first and third, respectively, in 
the 200m free. Junior Mike Robinson and 
sophomore Jon Alpert both did well in 
the freestyle events, placing first and 
second of the Tartans in the 200m free 
and eighth and fifth, respectively, in the 
500m free. Alpert also scored second in 
the 50m free. In addition, sophomore

in the 100m fly and fifth place in the 50m 
free while freshman Sean Belowich fin
ished second in the 100m backstroke and 
seventh in the 200m individual medley.
One ofthegreatest improvemntsfor CMU 
this season has been diving. Senior Sam 
Malloy finished fourth in the 3m diving 
event as did senior Sara Wade. The story of 
the day was freshman Brandon May, who 
broke school records in both the lm and 3m 
events, scoring 363.60 and 355.05, respec
tively. Its great that we have four more 
years with him, said Belowich.
Unique challenges faced the Tartan 
freshmen last weekend, as they faced
their first home meet and stiffest compe
tition of the year. I think the freshmen 
learned a little bit about themselves this 
weekend, said Belowich. It was the first 
time where there were three hard ses
sions in a row and many of the first-year 
students were fatigued by Sunday. The 
upperclassmen did a good job of helping 
them by example. One of these examples 
was Robinson. After setting a personal 
best time in the 500m freestyle and 
coming in eighth out of 30, he turned 
around 20 minutes later and won third 
place in the 200m individual medley, 
setting another personal best.
The contest ended with two solid sec
ond place finishes for the men and 
women. The mens rankings  tabu
lated before the last two diving events 
had Johns Hopkins with 762 points, 
CMU with 1003, and Emory with 1180. 
The womens competition ended Johns 
Hopkins 850, CMU 861, and Emory 1214.
Emory has demonstrated that it is 
the team to beat, said Belowich. Al
though it is too early to make solid pre
dictions and forecasts, Belowich is ex
cited about the UAA Championships in 
February. There is going to be a lot of 
great competition, he said.
The mens record now stands at 5-1 in 
head-to-head competition while the 
women are 3-3. The men have beaten 
two of the three UAA opponents they 
have faced this season and the women 
stand at 1-2, giving them momentum 
going into the next meet.
The team travels to Cleveland this 
Saturday to face yet another UAA rival 
in Case Western Reserve University. 
The whole team has a lot of confidence 
now, especially the women, said 
Belowich. They know that they are able 
to step up and race with anyone else.
Coming off the strong meet, Belowich 
wants to be sure to avoid a letdown. 
One of the things thats going to be 
difficult [for the Case meetl is getting 
the adrenaline going again, he said.
After the Case meet, the Tartans next 
meet will be after winter break on January 
16 at home versus Westminster College.

couple of mistakes in the begining of the 
game, and they buried them. We had a 
good chance, the puck just wouldnt go in

This loss is upsetting due to the fact that 
many ofthe CMU players had an outstand
ing game. Strong skating was shown par
ticularly by sophmore defenseman Aaron 
Hula, forward and graduate student Roger 
Maddalena and forwards juniors Dan

Quarterback gains redemption in spotlight
The Steelers Corner
by Rich Torio
Last weeks 27-20 victory over the 
Green Bay Packers dispelled any quar
terback controversy that was brewing 
after the debacle against Tennessee. 
Kordell Stewart out-dueled Brett Favre, 
throwing for nearly as many yards as 
the three-time MVP and rushing for as 
many yards as the entire Packers team.
Stewart accounted for two touchdowns 
in the first quarter, one on a pass to 
Charles Johnson and the other on his 
patented Slash splash quarterback 
sneak from the one, catapulting Pitts
burgh to a 14-0 lead. He was the cata
lyst for the Steelers 27 unanswered 
points, while Mike Tomczak (the other 
QB in the supposed controversy) sparked 
the Packers 20-point near-comeback, 
fumbling the ball on his only down at 
quarterback. Kordell Stewart proved 
that he is the only starting quarterback 
in Pittsburgh and that he is as good as
any quarterback in 
the league.
Discounting the 
Packers 20-point 
scoring binge at the 
end of the game, the 
Steelers played their 
best game as a team 
all year. Although 
Stewart played a 
great game, he did 
not and could not 
have won the game 
by himself; the loss 
to the Oilers is testi
mony that everyone 
has to show up.
Against Green 
Bay, everyone did 
show up. For the 
first time this year, 
all of the gears were 
churning in the 
same game (at least 
for the first half).
The passing game
finally clicked, which complemented the pun
ishing running game, which, in turn, kept 
the Packer offense off the field, aiding the 
dominating Steeler defense.
In front of a packed Three Rivers Stadium 
and a national Monday Night Football audi
ence, the Pittsburgh Steelers team showed 
that it could beat any team in the league.
James Mojonnler/Tartan Art Editor
One exciting development in the game 
was the play of two exceptional rookies: 
Hines Ward (a.k.a. Slash Junior) and Chris 
Fuamatu-Maafala (a.k.a. Fu). Hines Ward 
contributed on a number of passing downs, 
and made a couple catches, including a 45- 
yard shake-n-bake catch-n-run, showcasing 
his elusive moves. Fuamatu-Maafala, al
though he has a slightly different batter
ing-ram-like rushing style, was also used 
in some passing sets, and ran a draw play 
up the middle for a touchdown.
Offensive coordinator Ray Sherman 
seems to be getting comfortable with 
utilizing his rookie talent. Look for 
Sherman to use Ward and Fu even more 
as the year goes on. [Theyre] assets to 
the football team, said special teams 
captain Fred McAfee.
The schedule only gets tougher as the 
weeks go on, so the Steelers will need 
contributions from the rookies and ev
eryone else. This week we go down to 
Tennessee to avenge the loss the Steelers 
suffered to them two weeks ago, and the 
week after that, the Jaguars come to 
town. Divisional rivalry is heating up. 
The Steelers are coming together as a 
team at just the right time.Post-game Prognostication: (3-2)
I couldnt have been happier with the 
Steelers proving me wrong and beating 
the Packers last week. Tennesee again 
... will the Steelers have another let
down week? No.
Steelers 30-0ilers 10 
The Steelers need this divisional game 
and were embarassed a couple weeks ago 
by the Tennessee squad. Payback time.

their own 20. Three plays later, 
the Thomas Moore quarterback 
threw a 51-yard bomb downfield. 
The momentum was swaying to 
the Thomas Moore side. Three 
running plays later, an 18-yard 
rushing play put them up 14- 
13. That would be the score at 
the half.
They controlled the line of 
scrimmage on offense and de
fense in the second quarter, said 
Lackner. We came out and per
formed much better in the sec
ond half though.
The Tartans started the sec
ond half from their own 30. After 
an impressive drive, eating up 
over seven minutes of the clock, 
a 28-yard field goal put CMU in 
the lead 16-13. But Thomas 
Moore would answer. On their 
next drive, a 51-yard touchdown 
bomb caught the Tartan defense 
unaware, and CMU was down 
again, 16-20.
Both teams went three and out 
on their next two possessions, 
and the Tartans had the ball on 
their own 39 with 45 seconds left 
in the third. Clay took the field 
and showed his leadership abil
ity, orchestrating a 51-yard touch
down drive eating up over five 
minutes. The Tartans reclaimed 
the lead temporarily 23-20. But 
on the next drive, another 52- 
yard bomb dropped, on the CMU 
score, putting Thomas Moore in 
position for a game-tying field 
goal. The field goal was good, and 
the game was knotted at 23 and 
would go to overtime.
I dont know that either of us 
had momentum going into that 
point, said Lackner. We were
hoping to win the toss and go in 
defense first.
That didnt happen, though, 
and CMU started with the ball on 
the Thomas Moore 25. Junior 
runningback Mike Monsilovich 
ran on first down for a couple of 
yards setting up second and 8. On 
second down, Barnicle made a 
diving grab on a 11-yard pass, 
spotting the ball on the Thomas 
Moore 12. Junior fullback Mike 
Campie then rightfully punched 
it into the endzone from 12 yards 
out, right up the gut for the gamewinning touchdown.
Thomas Moore would be un
able to answer. Our defense 
rose to the occasion in overtime, 
said Lackner. The final score 
ended up CMU 30-Thomas 
More 23, in overtime.
The win caps off Carnegie 
Mellons 24th straight winning 
season but leaves them somewhat 
dissappointed. The only UAA team 
the Tartans lost to all year, Uni
versity of Chicago, won their game 
and consequently took the UAA 
championship, unseeding the de
fending champs from CMU.
We were hoping that someone 
would upset Chicago somewhere 
along the way, but that didnt hap
pen, said Lackner. Its frustrating 
when others control your destiny.
There are a lot of teams in the 
country that would love to be 7-3, 
but we set high standards at 
CMU, he said. We know we could 
have easily been 9-1.
Nevertheless, Lackner is happy 
with the year in general. The 
kids played hard, the coaches did 
well. Unfortunately, were going 
to look back and say Tiey, look 
what we could have done.

Tartan women win top spot in regional championships
RUNNERS, from page 8
the team effort ... the younger 
kids really stepped up.
It was nice as a senior be
cause we won the regionals my 
freshman year and have not won 
again since this year, she said. 
Its a nice way to go out.
This week, the women will 
be concentrating on preparing 
for the national meet but with 
low intensity workouts so they 
are not worn out. Allentown 
was our hardest race. We 
havent lost all year but I think 
that is going to change next 
week, said Donatelli. The 
women have run the Dickinson 
course many times this sea
son, giving them a small ad
vantage. Still, the tough na
tional-level competition leaves 
the women hoping to make it 
in the top five.
The men are less confident 
about how they will place this 
upcoming weekend. Although
the team snagged second place in 
the regional meet, coach Gary 
Meckley isnt sure how the team 
will fare.
Nationals is a really strange 
event. The best thing to do is go 
out at a comfortable pace. Its 
sort of like the tortoise and the 
hare. The teams that run a con
trolled race do better. Meckley 
has a game plan for the men to 
follow, starting out slow and 
picking up towards the end 
when the other teams are los
ing momentum.
I dont like to make predic
tions because every day is differ
ent ... but if we run like we have 
been running this season, well 
do well, said McGranaghan.
The men will rely on senior 
Kristopher Kriechbaum, who 
came in first on the team this 
week in ninth place, senior Kenn 
Oldham, who came in 11th, and 
junior Bryan Meyer, who came 
in 12th.
Meckley explained that the 
team is at a slight disadvantage 
currently because one of the top 
runners, senior Josh Donner, has 
a knee injury. He wouldve been 
right up there with our leaders, 
said Meckley. The injury, how
ever, kept Donner out of the 
teams lead last weekend and may 
effect the overall chances of plac
ing high next weekend.
The men are expecting tough 
competition from North Central 
College, schools from the Wiscon
sin area, Tufts, and MIT. But 
Meckley said he is planning on 
preparing the men for their tough 
competition with the right bal
ance of training and rest.
Both the men and the women 
have had exceptional seasons so 
far and will test the limits of their 
abilities this weekend at nation
als. Whether or not they place 
high, the Tartan runners have 
given a good showing in the cross 
country arena this season.

Mens squad loses heartbreaker in OT
By MATT BRUNTartan Staffwriter
Imagine all the torturous prac
tices, the agonizing defeats, and 
the joyous victories of an entire 
season riding on one game. This 
was the situation facing the 
mens soccer team last Satur
day as it headed into its regional
tournament game against 
Dickinson College.
From the opening kick-off, the 
game resembled more of an epic 
battle than just a soccer game. 
Neither team could put together 
a serious offensive threat for 
much of the game as both de
fenses put on dominant perfor
mances. It was a defensiveSports this week...

battle all the way, head coach 
Nick Gaudioso said.
It wasnt until the 7Oth minute 
that either team generated a 
quality scoring chance, and even 
then the offensive effort didnt 
deserve all the credit. For a brief 
moment, the Dickinson defense 
lost its control, leading to a mad 
scramble in front of the goal. 
Junior midfielder Doug Jones 
stepped up and was able to poke 
the ball into the net to give CMU 
the lead with 20 minutes left 
to play.
For 19 of those minutes, the 
Tartan defense did exactly what 
its were supposed to do, play 
safe and protect the lead at all 
costs. Then, with only 60 sec
onds separating the Tartans 
from a berth in the finals, 
Dickinson broke through and 
tied the game. Gaudioso 
summed up the Tartans reac
tion very well. When Doug 
scored to give us the lead, we 
really thought we could pull it 
out... up until the last minute, 
he said.
Neither team felt willing to 
take a big risk in the final 
minute, and the game went into 
overtime. Just 10 minutes later, 
heartbreak struck the Tartan
bench again as Dickinson broke 
through the defense a second 
time to take the lead. The Tar
tans refused to back down, how
ever, and kept their focus de
spite playing on the verge of 
elimination. Unfortunately, the 
Dickinson defense was not ea
ger to surrender its lead and 
continued to stifle the CMU of
fense. The only real chance the 
Tartans were able to generate 
the rest of the game was a shot 
in front that sailed high over 
the crossbar with less than 10 
seconds remaining, effectively 
ending the Tartans season.
After the game, Gaudioso had 
little to say that could accurately 
express the teams disappoint
ment. It was really tough on 
the seniors, to lose their last 
game like that, he said.
Compounding the teams frus
tration was the very nature of 
the tournament. For the region 
that CMU competes in, the top 
five teams earn spots in the 
NCAA tournament. The next 
four go to the consolation re
gional tournament. This was the 
third straight year that CMU 
has gone to the regional tourna
ment, losing in the first round 
each time.
Football ends season with win
By RICH TORIOTartan Staffwriter
The Tartan football team finished the 
season in dramatic fashion, going into 
overtime against Thomas Moore College 
last Saturday. It was a battle between 
two solid football teams with contrasting 
styles: the smash-mouth CMU running 
game against the top-flight Thomas 
Moore air attack. It was one of those 
games that came down to the little things 
like discipline, execution, and courage.
It was an exciting, well played game, 
said head coach Rich Lackner.
The first nine minutes of the game were 
a stalemate, as neither team scored. With 
6:00 showing on the clock, CMU scored 
first on a 15-yard pass over the middle 
from junior quarterback Russ Clay to se
nior wide receiver Chris Bamicle. After 
the extra point, the Tartans were up 7-0.
After the ensuing kickoff, on the second 
play from scrimmage, junior comerback 
Chris Martinez picked off an errant Tho
mas Moore pass and ran it back to the 
teams 28-yard line. After two plays, the 
Tartans found themselves in a critical 
third-and-six to keep the drive alive. Clay 
faked a handoff inside, dropped back to 
pass, then floated a spiral to the right 
comer of the end zone, once again right 
into the hands of Bamicle. The 24-yard 
connection put the Tartans up 13-0.
We were able to hit early and jump out 
to a quick lead, said Lackner.

big runs and screens, they got into the

Runners advance to NCAA national meet
By ENA KHANTartan Managing Editor
Despite a rocky course with short 
hills, wooden bridges, and a creek, the 
womens and mens cross country 
teams dashed to the finish line in 
Allentown, taking first and second 
place in this past weekends regional 
meet. Both teams qualified for the 
national meet next weekend at 
Dickinson College.
We got out of there with no injuries, 
and were heading out to nationals, 
said Dario Donatelli, coach for the 
womens team. Although the women 
did manage to evade injuries, fresh
man Brooke Cutler gave the team a 
small scare when she almost fell early 
in the race. With hundreds of runners 
at her heels, Cutler slipped on the 
course. Just as she was going down, 
teammate junior Andrea Byrnes pulled 
Cutler by the back of her shirt and got 
her back on her feet. [Byrnes] sort of 
saved the race, said Donatelli.
If Cutler had been injured, the 
women may not have been able to take 
first place with only 71 points. The 
College of New Jersey trailed after 
them with 84 points, and Moravian
came in third with 109 points. The win 
was due to speedy senior Matgaret 
Powers who came in third, senior 
Maureen McGranaghan in fifth, Cut
ler in third, and Byrnes in 20th place.
Powers and McGranaghan managed 
to stick together for most of the race, 
although an opponent caught up with 
McGranaghan towards the end of the 
race to steal the fourth spot. Marga
ret has a little more speed than 
Maureen. In the end, Maureen got 
nipped by the other girl, said 
Donatelli.
Donatelli was especially pleased with 
the rest of the team this week since the 
course was rough, which made it diffi
cult for the women to ran together. 
Although Powers and McGranaghan 
were able to support each other 
through the race, the other women 
were separated by the obstacles in the 
course. The other girls ran well be
cause they were kind of alone in the 
race. They had to do it themselves and 
rely on their instincts, said Donatelli. 
We couldnt ran the race the way we 
like to run, which is a team race.
I felt like everyone worked together,

Hockey loses to skilled Penn State West team
By ERIN LUCASTartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Saturday night, the Carnegie 
Mellon ice hockey team faced Penn State 
West (PSW) at the Kirk S. Nevin Arena 
in Greensburg, Penn. The game was 
fast paced and enjoyable to watch as 
both teams played a skillful and excit
ing game.
There were only eight minutes of pen
alties served during the entire game. 
However, this was a match full of missed 
opportunits for the Tartans. Although
We made a couple of 
mistakes in the beginning 
of the game, and they 
buried them. 
 coach Fred Maddalena
CMU put forth a strong performance, 
awkwardly bouncing pucks and missed 
passes plagued the team.
Penn State West dominated the open
ing period. Outstanding skating by 
PSWs first line resulted in three goals
during the first period. PSWs third 
goal was scored on the power play 
while graduate student Adam 
Duncan was serving a two-minute 
minor for tripping.
The second period began promis
ingly as CMU matched the quick skat
ing of the PSW players. CMU put 
numerous strong shots on goal, but for 
some reason, the puck eluded the net. 
Despite the stong skating shown by 
the Tartans, PSW was able to score 
three additional goals towards the end 
of the period.
_____ The Tartans played wonder
fully during the third period. 
Hard work and great skating 
resulted in numerous solid 
scoring opportunits; how
ever, the lack of actual goals 
could only be explained by bad 
luck. The Tartans, frustrated 
with the game, allowed two 
more goals during the course 
i of the period.
The score is not indicative 
of the game, said head coach Fred 
Manddalena. [PSW] outplayed us in 
the first period but only achieved three 
goals. We played even in the second 
and better in the third. We made a

CMU swims past defending champ
By BRIAN SMITHTartan Sports Editor
In a meet marked by personal bests 
and natural highs, the Carnegie Mellon 
swim team defeated Johns Hopkins 
University for the first time in the his
tory of the swim pro
gram last weekend.
The win came in the 
Tartans first home 
meet of the season, 
as CMU hosted 
Johns Hopkins and 
Emory, who are tra
ditionally the top 
two teams in the 
University Athletic 
Association (UAA).
Its nice to be in 
our conference, 
said head coach 
David Belowich.

timeswhich is highly unusual for this 
point in the season.
The team went into the three-day event 
coming off a strong performance at the 
Rochester Relay Meets and, before that, 
a sweep at the double-dual meet against 
Grove City College and Gannon Univerbackstroke, fourth in the 200m back, 
and eighth in the 200m free. Sophomore 
Julie Tseng captured second in the 200m 
free, junior Erin Rockwell got second 
place in the 100m and 200m breast, and 
sophomore Melissa Schmelzer finished 
second in the 200m butterfly and fifth in

last year so its going to be interesting 
this year.
We swam perhaps the best in-season 
meet since Ive been here, said Belowich. 
A lot of our women had lifetime best

test for the Tartans, however.
Some of the top Tartan performances 
of the weekend included senior Jen 
Skuly, who finished second in the 100m
the 400m free. Senior Michelle Kondo 
also led the team, settling for a second

Writer shares her account of typical days work
iy WENDY BUFFETTtartan Junior Staffwriter
Monday, 12:00 pm. I cant 
>elieve I have this much stuff to
do. I just know that Im going to 
be up all night working on 
these stupid projects. Do the 
teachers get together and coor
dinate their due dates so that
we have no rest whatsoever? 
They must. Theres no other 
explanation for it.
I was up until 2 am last night 
working on that silly project. 
Sure, they assigned it on 
Friday, so I could have worked 
on it then, or Saturday, or 
Sunday ... but who wants to 
do homework on the weekends? 
Thats not what theyre 
made for.
So now I have to work on that 
Art History project. I dont even 
know what Im doing, and 
its due tomorrow. He just 
gave us the assignment 
two weeks ago. How does 
he expect us to do all 
that research?
Plus I have to do work 
for Studio. I tried to work 
on it during the weekend, 
but all those things kept 
coming up. Like laundry. You 
know its time to do your laun
dry when your excuse for being 
late is, I couldnt find any 
underwear. I had to do the
dishes, too, because I was 
inventing ways to eat cereal 
without having to use a bowl or 
spoon. That wasnt hard, 
though, because I never got 
around to getting milk....
But I have to work on the 
History project. All I have to do 
is find the name of an artist 
from the Romance period. I cant 
go to Hunt. I already owe them 
two weeks worth of fines for 
overdue books. The Internets 
good enough.
I cant even remember what 
exactly Im supposed to do with 
it, though. I have to find the 
assignment before I can do my 
research. How am I supposed to 
find anything in this messy 
room? My desk really needs 
organizing. No one can work 
when there are papers every
where, along with dirty dishes. 
Woah, thats scary. I dont even 
remember eating that.12:45 pm. Well, now that my 
desk is cleared off, I can orga
nize myself. Speaking of which,
if I dont have a to do list, I can 
never finish everything that 
needs to be done. Ive been 
meaning to clean out the aquar
ium. My gold fish is starting to 
look more like burnt umber.2:00 pm. I never realized that 
cleaning out an aquarium takes 
an hour. Well, now to complete 
the rest of my list. Look at all 
the stuff I have to do. I just 
know Im going to be up all 
night. I wonder when everyones 
going to dinner. Id better call 
around and find out.4:45 pm. I just love having 
long talks with people. I should 
find that Web site she told me 
about while Im working on my 
Art History project. Oh crap, I 
forgot about that. Well, theres 
not enough time to get any real 
work done on it right now. I only 
have 45 minutes until dinner.6:50 pm. I really wish 
Highlander would stop trying to 
be creative. Now that Ive gone 
to Grab N Go and stocked up on 
Twizzlers and root beer for
breakfast, I can get started on 
that paper. Wow, seven oclock 
already? I still havent done that 
studio work. Oh well. The 
teachers out of it, anyway. He 
probably wont even notice.8:15 pm. Caron always calls at 
the worst possible times. I told 
her that I had work to do, but 
she never listens to me. By the 
time we finished talking, it was 
eight oclock already.9:00 pm. I finally found the 
assignment sheet for my Art 
History project, as I was orga
nizing all of the papers lying 
around into their correct note
books. Theyve been accumulat
ing since the first day of school, 
and I simply cant find anything 
anymore. Well, now Im ready.9:15 pm. If I can just go down 
to the cluster, do some quick 
researching online, and print 
out a picture, I might be done by 
midnight. Thats about when I 
usually go to bed. Maybe it wont 
be as bad as I thought. Wow,

Students postulate reasons for putting off their studies
By SETH MANDEL according to many CMU students, pro-Tartan Personnel Manager crastination is a common practice that
often leads to both expected and unexI must confess: Im handing in this pected consequences, 
article late. In fact, the truth is that I A number of students were well 
didnt even start writing it until after it aware of the consequences of procrastiwas due. And it wasnt because I was nating, but decided to do it anyway.
When you have nothing better to do, you 
have to invent something to do. I mean, how 
can I study when I dont know how many 
paper clips I have?
 Grant Catton, first-year H&SS student
too busy or had more important things 
to do, because I didnt. There were just 
a few things that I wanted to do instead 
of write. For some reason I felt the 
desire to count the number of tiles in 
my bathroom (10,588), plan out my 
class schedule for the next two years, 
and wonder whether the nose of the 
Hamerschlag statue in Baker Hall is 
shiny because people rub it for good 
luck or because CPS comes by every 
night and polishes it.
If my situation sounds familiar to 
you, then you are not alone, because
Last semester, in 15-211, I procrasti
nated doing the last assignment, 
which was pretty big. So, J decided not 
to do it. I ended up getting a B in the 
class, but it was worth it for the sake of 
my sleep, said Ryan Kellogg, a junior 
electrical and computer engineering 
(ECE) major. I went into the cluster 
and laughed at everyone who was 
pulling an all-nighter to get the assign
ment done.
For other students, however, putting 
off work led to some unexpected out
comes. One night I procrastinated so
much that I had to stay up really late to 
study for three tests. The next day, I 
fell asleep during a test, and my 
teacher had to come in the back and 
wake me up, said Sirisha Reddy, a 
sophomore H&SS undeclared student.
While most students were able to cite 
several examples of times when procras
tination led to difficulties, many 
expressed no desire to stop putting off 
their work. In fact, many students said 
they procrastinate intentionally and 
have specific reasons for doing so, 
which range from academic justifi
cations to laziness and boredom.
While procrastination may 
not initially seem like 
a formula for 
academic suc
cess, many 
students felt 
that it actual
ly could be 
one. I like to pro
crastinate because I 
work better under 
pressure, said Alexis 
Santana, a first-year 
undeclared CIT student.
Other students felt that 
academic conditions actual
ly necessitate postponing 
their work. I procrastinate
because I excel under pressure and I 
know that the professors will change 
the homework assignment anyway, 
said Namita Amin, a graduate student 
in GSIA.
Many other students, however, 
admitted that procrastination was 
more the result of a matter of a lack of 
motivation than anything else. Its 
easier to procrastinate than to do the
work, said Aria Thomases, a first-year 
design major.
Id rather slack off or sleep than 
work. Its just more fun, said 
Margaret DeLap,- a first-year computer 
science major.
Boredom was also a common reason 
for procrastinating. Grant Catton, a 
first-year H&SS undeclared student

Counselors provide advice for success
all art this page by Nell Babra/Tartan Art Staff
By KEVIN BABBITTTartan Features Editor
If someone told you that you were 
squandering hours and hours of valuable 
time each week, you would probably 
laugh. At CMU, everyone has too much 
stuff to do and not enough time to do it. 
Or do we?
Most people have about 60 hours each 
week that they cant account for, said 
Preeta Roy, a senior biology major and 
academic counselor in the Academic 
Development office. As one could proba
bly imagine, much of this time is spent 
on such productive activities as 
checking email, channel-surfing, or play
ing games.
But according to Linda Hooper, coordi
nator of Academic Development, this 
time could be put to better use. Be care
ful about those little bits of time; those 
five to 10 minutes will add up to hours, 
she said. If you take 10 minutes to 
review lecture notes, thats important 
for memory as well [as extended periods 
of studying].
Procrastination is something that peo
ple do for a variety of reasons, according to 
Hooper: fear of failure, lack of interest in 
the work that needs to be done, or just the 
presence of distractions in the studying 
environment. When you go back to your 
room, thats a danger point right there, 
because theres a stereo, a TVj [or] your 
bed, said Hooper. Youve been sleeping 
on a bed for 19 years; if you study there, 
youre probably going to fall asleep. 
Obviously, if distractions are an issue, 
then removing the distractions can help 
students get more done. Even better, said 
Hooper, is to remove oneself from the distractipns. After dinner, dont go back to 
your room. Go to the library and study, 
then go back to your room and have fun. 
Worries are another frequent cause of 
procrastination, according to Roy. A lot of 
people get into these worry cycles, where 
you procrastinate, have fun, maybe get a 
little behind, maybe a chapter behind, 
she said. You get into a cycle of being late 
and worrying more than you work. What 
ends up happening, she added, is that 
trying to put off the work by doing some
thing fun defeats the purpose of having 
fun, because youre still worried about 
having to do the work later on.
Proper management of time and goals 
can also help students fight the urge to 
procrastinate. Many times, when stu
dents sit down to study, they dont do so 
with a plan of action and a goal in mind, 
according to Hooper. When students 
study with this mindset, its a lot easier 
to get distracted and start putting off 
what needs to be done. Instead, she and 
Roy both said it was better to break 
down exactly how they will spend their 
time before beginning. Set aside one 
hour for studying, then take a 15 to 30 
minute, worry-free break time as a 
reward, said Roy.
If the task at hand is expected to be 
more time-consuming, breaking the task 
down into smaller sub-tasks can be help
ful. For example, a student could break a 
problem set into smaller groups of prob
lems, taking a break after each group. 
This way, the individual tasks dont seem 
quite as daunting.

There was David Wells perfect game and Kerry Woods 20-strikeout game. Then it was Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire pursuing and ultimately surpassing the single-season home run record. Cal Ripken Jr. decided to sit out a game for the first time since 1982. And. in the end, the Yankees initiated arguments all over the country about their possible place among the greatest teams of all time. These are just some of the events that made many fans consider the 1998 Major League Baseball season one of the best ever.The Tartan recently spoke with Computer Science professor Jacobo Carrasquel who has been an enthusiastic baseball follower since his childhood in Venezuela. He spoke about his various perspectives of the national pastime, his recent journey to the Baseball Hall of Fame, as well as his connections to All-Star Chico Carrasquel who played in the big leagues in the 1950s.
The Tartan: In September, you took a 
trip to Cooperstow^New York to see 
the Hall of Fame. Tell me a little more 
about that weekend.Jacobo Carrasquel: I have a group of 
basically four friends, and our common 
interest is baseball. One guy is from 
Pittsburgh, one guy is from 
Philadelphia, and one guy is from 
Baltimore. And we always get together 
each year for one weekend and go to 
different baseball stadiums to watch 
ballgames. Traditionally, we do it the

last week of the season. Weve been 
doing this for 16 years now.
This year we went to Cooperstown 
because two of them have never been 
there. It was a change of pace instead 
of going to a baseball stadium.TT. Did you do any research on your 
cousin while you were there?JC: Chico Carrasquel was my 
fathers cousin. There was a special 
exhibit of Roberto Clemente, and next 
to it, they had a display of different 
Latin players. In that display, there 
was a glove that Chico apparently 
used, but there was a typo on the dis
play. So I spoke with one of the staff 
and told him that I was a relative of 
Chicos, which started us talking. They
have a file about every player 
who has ever played in profes
sional baseball, and I got to see 
some photographs and other 
information about Chico.TT: What was Chicos career 
like when he played for the 
Chicago White Sox?JC: A curious thing is that he 
played shortstop for the White 
Sox for eight years in a row. After 
him, he was replaced by another 
Venezuelan shortstop, Luis 
Aparicio, who would eventually 
become a Hall-of-Famer. So for 
20 years, the White Sox had a 
Venezuelan shortstop.
When the staff worker asked 
me about what Chicos doing 
now, I told him that he currently 
works for the Chicago White Sox 
as a radio broadcaster. He 
broadcasts the games in Spanish 
for the Chicago area. He is also a 
coach for a team in the winter leagues 
in Venezuela.TT: Was it Chicos career that 
spurred your great interest in baseball?JC: I think back in Venezuela that 
was one of the things that influenced 
me. My father was also a baseball fan. 
He still is a very devoted Yankee fan. 
So certainly, Chicos career had an 
influence on me for following baseball 
when growing up.TT: Speaking of the New York 
Yankees, what did you think about this 
past baseball season? What was your 
favorite moment?JC: It was incredible. It just tells you 
that there are two tiers there: those
teams with money and those teams 
without. If you dont have the money, 
you dont get far. A thing I was just 
reading in Sports Illustrated was that 
every team in the playoffs had a payroll 
of over $40 million.
My favorite was obviously when 
Mark McGwire. actually broke the 
record with his 62nd home run. And 
then the other highlight was just fol
lowing up on the home run race 
between McGwire and Sosa to see who 
would end up with a higher number. It 
was something everybody was talking 
about. Even those who werent inter
ested in baseball talked about McGwire 
and Sosa.TT: Can you tell me a little more 
about the annual trip you make with 
your friends?JC: Again, its a very strange group. 
We dont have much interaction during 
the rest of the year. The guy who lives 
in Pittsburgh is a good friend of mine. 
But with the other guys, usually we 
just email each other once a month.
But when we get together in the fall, 
what we do is get in a car and we have 
baseball encyclopedias and baseball 
books, and we just immerse ourselves 
in statistics, players, and baseball talk 
dining the whole car ride.
Weve been to all the stadiums on the 
East Coast and the Midwest. So natu
rally, the next place we want to go is 
the West Coast, but it is obviously too 
far to drive there. When we get togeth
er for those three days, during that 
time its total baseball  no family, no 
politics, no religion, just baseball. Its a 
beautiful thing.

that say Will fire people for food, 
exercisers seeking to lose weight turn 
to the Bloodcercize program (which 
offers a completely painless plan except 
for an uncontrollable tendency to spurt 
blood all over the place), and Hitler 
appears on Sally Jesse Raphael to get a 
makeover. Welcome to the cynical 
world of political cartoonist Ted Rail, 
who came to McConomy Auditorium
Lily Rouhanl/Tartan Photo Staff 
Rail spoke before a enthusiastic crowd 
gathered in McConomy Auditorium.
last Thursday evening to give an AB 
Political Speakers-sponsored talk.
Rail contributes cartoons and com
mentary to numerous mainstream and 
non-mainstream publications. His goal 
is to do more than just create jokes 
about the news like he sees his fellow 
cartoonists doing. To me, politics is 
about trying to change the world, he 
said. If youre not trying to change the 
world, whats the point?
Many of his cartoons do seek to 
change the world, or at least to get peo
ple to think - seriously about whats 
wrong with this one. They take on such 
issues as corporate cruelty and race 
and class divisions.
Rail first showed the audience slides 
of some of his cartoons, which have 
been published in the likes of Time, The San Francisco Examiner, and, oddly 
enough considering Rails relentlessly 
anti-capitalist agenda, Fortune. He 
shared stories about the origins of spe
cific cartoons and the opinions that 
went into them. He offered frank com
mentary about the failings that he sees 
in America. One multi-panel cartoon 
called Roberts Flu features a student 
who is sick for the seventh-grade exam 
that determines whether he can take 
French, which leads.to getting stuck in 
the wrong classes in high school, which 
leads to a lifetime of failure and misery. 
By way of explanation for this cartoon,
Rail said, America, besides having no 
class, is supposed to be a classless soci
ety. Of course, thats ridiculous. 
Despite its relative smallness  only 
about 50 people attended the lecture  
the audience did its best to ensure a

neering at Columbia University until 
he got expelled, also offered a bit of dra

lively question-and-answer session 
after the slides.
Many people asked questions which 
showed familiarity with Rails work. 
Attendees also didnt hesitate to ask 
more controversial questions. After 
Rail explained that he draws the fig
ures in his cartoons abstractly partly to 
avoid slipping into ethnic caricatures, 
audience members asked him several 
difficult questions about where hed 
draw the line. For example, one 
attendee asked why, if Rail was so care
ful not to use simplified caricatures 
that might misrepresent ethnic groups, 
did he continue to draw men and 
women as different in contexts where 
they didnt need to be.
just the Man  youre working for the 
Evil Man, he said. Theres still time. 
Get bad grades. Get expelled.
Despite, or maybe because of, the fric
tion he generated, Rail was pleased by 
his reception. Whats the fun of preach
ing to the converted, right? he asked. 
Its more interesting to talk to people 
who think about what you have to say. 
I was really glad I got to see [Rail]  
it was suprising that more people did

senior in creative writing and biology.

like that.

Let your mind wander back a bit to 
the last general biology class you took: 
perhaps CMUs 03-103 or, if its been a 
while, high school biology. Chances are, 
at some point in your academic career, 
youve gotten to stick your nose into a 
tray full of frog guts, vivisected mudpuppy, or disemboweled fetal pig. And 
certainly youve had to study basic 
human anatomy at some point; you 
' may not remember the pathway of food 
through the alimentary canal, but you 
know that food goes in one end and out 
the other, with a stint in the stomach 
sometime in between.
Now, suppose that youve asked your 
bio teacher a question about how food 
breaks down into usable energy. If that 
teacher closed her eyes sagely and said, 
with a wave of the hand, Ah, it all hap
pens with a magic rumble of the stom
ach, youd probably drop the course 
and file a formal complaint against the 
prof for being a nutcase. The energy 
that we use doesnt come from magic; it 
comes from (basically) broken-down 
carbohydrates and lipids whose energy 
forms adenosine triphosphate mole
cules, which in turn provide energy to 
our cells.
But I have lost count of the number of 
times that some allegedly knowledge
able person has explained a computer 
program or chip-based gadget with a 
lofty Oh, you just hit the button, and 
then magically the program/gadget 
does its work! Many of these magical 
experiences have, frighteningly, been 
at CMU, a place where theres probably 
a higher per-capita knowledge of com
puters than most other places in the 
world. Outside of our enclave, its even 
worse. The general population that 
relies so heavily on computerized
machines and systems probably could
nt tell a hard drive from memory, much 
less a bit from a byte.
After all, the whole premise of 
Apples recently released iMac was 
simplicity: You dont have to know a 
damned thing about the machine; you 
just plug it into the wall and, whiz 
bang, it starts to churn away under
neath that nice teal case that conve
niently matches any hipsters decor 
(admittedly, the iMacs could redeem 
themselves if someone had thought to 
put strobe lights under the casings). 
Similarly, people continue to be irra
tionally afraid of sending out their 
credit card numbers over the Internet 
in secure-site transactions, even 
though they probably trash their num
ber-bearing store receipts with nary a 
second thought.
Weve all heard commentators decry 
the way that technology is widening 
the gap between the poor and the notso-poor: Those with money can afford 
computers, and their kids can grow up 
knowing how to use a word-processor 
and how to riddle digital enemies with 
pixelated bullets. But there is another
gap that few people pay attention to. 
Among the class of computer-rhaves, 
there is only a small portion who actu
ally know how the computers work.
No, it probably isnt necessary, prac
tically speaking, for everyone to know 
how to write Linux device drivers in 
assembly language. But it is useful for 
computer users to basically under
stand how computers think  how 
everything is a series of zeroes and 
ones, and how those two values repre
sent the presence or absence of an 
electrical charge. Even a simple 
scripting language can show users 
how computers use things like func
tions and arrays and Boolean tests to 
process information.
Letting a small portion of society (in 
this case, those who can tell a compil
er from a hole in the ground) be 
responsible for virtually all knowledge 
of one of the crucial pillars of society
 here, computers  is a dangerous 
move. And remaining completely igno
rant of how these crucial machines 
work is like not knowing how to add 
oil to your engine or how to explain 
that your stomach hurts. Its vital to
have a basic understanding of the 
complex systems most important to 
our society  cars, our physical bod
ies, the way government works, tech
nology  so we dont have to rely 100 
percent on a group of experts to main
tain those systems for us.
Computers are no more magical 
than movies are. But when the first 
motion picture was shown to audi
ences around the turn of the century, 
the viewers in the theater ducked for 
cover when they saw a train moving 
towards them. Were they near a train 
station? No, but they couldnt explain 
the mechanism that they saw before 
them. They feared it.
So learn about the new mechanisms 
that have been taking over our culture 
for the past 15 years, and will contin
ue to do so indefinitely. And before you 
can say abracadabra, youll be able 
to install your iMacs strobe light all 
by yourself.

HELP, from page LI
Sometimes, students put work 
off because they feel they work 
better under pressure. While 
this may be the case to some 
extent, Hooper advises against 
it. You dont want to put your
self under constant pressure; 
when youre up late three or four 
nights in a row, its going to 
break down, she said. What if 
one waits until the night before 
to do an assignment, and theres 
a family emergency? They wont 
)e able to meet the demands put 
on them.
No matter what the cause is, 
though, the first step in beating
back procrastination is to identi
fy exactly what is causing it, 
according to Hooper, whether it 
is fear of a course, time manage
ment, being a member of too 
many social organizations, or a 
perceived need to overachieve. 
At CMU ... we have such over
achieving students that when 
they get a B or a C on an exam, 
they want to give up  to study 
that subject last instead of first, 
said Hooper. Its also important 
for the individual to identify his 
or her strengths, to give them 
something to draw from.
If the problem is just getting 
started on an assignment, particularly a time-consuming one, 
sometimes trying to work on it 
for a short time is helpful. If 
theres an assignment you dont 
want to do, give it five or 10 min
utes, said Roy. When you work 
on it really hard for 10 minutes, 
it gets you on a roll sometimes. 
Then you can either stop or con
tinue doing it, but usually youre 
on a roll, so you continue. 
Finally, dont forget to take 
advantage of those bits and 
pieces of dead time you have 
between engagements. You just 
might find a few hours lying 
around that you didnt even 
know you had.

Students find alternatives to doing their homework
STUDENTS, from page LI
said, When you have nothing 
better to do, you have to invent 
something to do. I mean, how 
can I study when 1 dont know 
how many paper clips I have? 
According to a number of 
other students, procrastination 
can be easily justified. If you 
have a lot of work to do you can 
get really nervous about doing 
it, but if you dont do it you have 
a stress-free life, said Alissa 
Green, a junior ECE major.
I procrastinate because I 
dont want to miss out on life 
experiences or other opportuni
ties by strictly adhering to my 
educational responsibilities, 
said Mousumi Sircar, a firstyear cognitive science major.
Not all CMU students said 
they procrastinate, however. It 
is a good idea to get your work 
done as soon as possible after 
you get it. It saves a lot of frus
tration, said Josh McKinley, a 
first-year materials science and
engineering major. I got into 
the habit of getting work done 
early in high school because I 
didnt have time to procrasti
nate since I had a job as a farm
hand seven days a week while 
going to school, he said.
So for those of you who do pro
crastinate, maybe its time to 
reconsider your study habits. 
But then again, maybe its not. 
After all, there are plenty of 
other things you could be doing 
right now instead.

L4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 November 1998
Debate pits present values against those of past
By KATIE MARTINEZTartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday night, McConomy 
filled up with students eager to see 
Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS, and John 
Hooker, head of the Business 
Administration Department, battle it 
out. But this was no ordinary battle; 
the two were pitted against each other 
in a debate over whether or not the val
ues of the 1950s are superior to those of 
the 1990s.
The debate was sponsored by the 
CMU Speech and Parliamentary 
Debate Society. Oliver Popov, president 
of the society and a senior business 
administration major, said, We wanted 
to promote the society, and we thought 
that [a debate] would be successful and 
appealing to the student body.
Hooker and Stearns were chosen to 
participate in the debate both as a 
result of their notoriety on campus and 
because of their support and enthusi
asm for the Speech and Parliamentary 
Debate Society.
Stearns ... has been very supportive 
of this organization, said Popov. 
Hooker has studied philosophy and
logic, and he participated in a public 
debate we sponsored last semester 
within the Business Department.
The event started out with a mock 
debate presented by members of the 
Speech and Parliamentary Debate 
Society over whether or not the gov
ernment should negotiate with terror
ists. Before the mock debate com
menced, Popov explained to the audi
ence the proper way to behave during a 
debate, including the correct way to 
display support for a presented point 
(tapping on the desk) and the correct 
way to interject if a member of the 
audience wished to contribute informa
tion to the debate.
While some members of the audience 
were entertained, others were confused 
and put-off by the pre-debate. Marisa 
Maclsaac, a first-year art history 
major, said, I thought it was going to 
be interesting, but it was just scary, 
and I also found it odd that all of the 
debaters were male.
During the real debate, Hooker took 
the affirmative stance and argued the 
values of the 1950s were indeed superi
or to those of today, by asserting the 
various manifestations of Puritanism
prevalent in our modern-day society. 
The specific examples that he used 
included the modem obsession with 
proper diet and the uptight American 
attitude towards sex. He also stated 
that the 1990s are a period in which 
were moving towards universalism 
and attempting to compensate for the 
decay in our moral fiber.
Steams took the negative stance and 
argued that the 1990s are a superior 
era, value-wise. He began his argument 
by stating that nostalgia for the 50s is 
fun, but that it rests on gross oversim
plifications. Asserting the examples of 
racism, McCarthyism, and gender dis
crimination, Steams pointed out that 
American cultural values have 
improved in many ways since the 1950s 
in that Americans drink less, smoke 
less, and work harder than they did in 
the 1950s.
Stearns argument in favor of the val
ues of the 1990s tended to be the most 
popular one among students. Adam 
Gerard, a sophomore business adminis
tration major, said, Stearns made a 
much better argument than Hooker. He 
debated the same way he teaches: point 
by point, and case by case.
Although the subject 
was what drew some stu
dents to McConomy on 
Wednesday night, the 
participants in the debate 
were the main interests of 
others. Gerard said, I 
went to the debate 
because Peter Stearns is 
just an interesting guy, 
and it seemed like a neat 
idea having two profes
sors debating. If it was 
two professors that I did
nt know, I probably 
wouldnt go.
In some cases, the 
points brought up in the 
debate were sufficient to 
alter the opinions of some 
students. Asha Pathak, 
an H&SS first-year stu
dent, said, I thought that 
the 50s had better morals 
but the 90s were better to 
live in, but all kinds of 
opinions and viewpoints 
were discussed and now I 
have changed some of 
my opinions.

um for an evening of debate last Thursday.

I have to write my paper. Its 
nearly 3 am.3:15 am. This is so boring. 
Why do teachers always give us 
homework assignments that
are so time-consuming? Dont 
they have lives? I didnt get to 
do anything tonight, including 
my Studio work. All Ive done 
is work on this stupid thing 
all night.4:00 am. There, its done. It 
sucks, and its obviously done 
hurriedly, but if I stay up any 
later Im either going to start 
hallucinating or pass out cold 
on the floor. Oh, no, I have a 
summary due tomorrow, too!
I havent even read the article 
yet.... Oh great, its more 
like a book.
Office furniture?! Youve got to 
be kidding. Who could possibly 
write 45 pages about office fur
niture? Well, I cant do anything 
about it now. I have to sleep. I
can read it during Art History. 
Ive spent enough time on that 
class already. Then I can type it 
up during lunch, and I might 
only be a few minutes late turn
ing it in.4:30 am. Finally, I can go to 
bed. Four thirty in the morning, 
and Ive been working on this 
stupid project since noon. They 
never give us enough time to do 
anything. I dont understand 
how they expect us to get it 
done when we never have any 
time to do it.
Im so glad this day is over. 
That weights off my back, any
way. Now I can relax until ... oh 
no, I have a paper due on 
Thursday! Great. I bet Ill be up 
all night that day, too.

Fun Facts about SPAM
 Jay C. Hormel, son of the company's founder, was determined to find a use for severArmy alive during World War II. We had lost our most fertile, food-bearing lands, the 
al thousand pounds of surplus pork shoulder. He developed a distinctive canned blend Ukraine and the Northern Caucasians. Without SPAM, we wouldn't have been able to 
of chopped pork and ham known as Hormel spiced ham that didn't require refrigeration, feed our army.''
 At the 1983 Spamposium, 33 self-proclaimed Spamophiles gathered from across the 
nation to deliver scholarly papers and demonstrations, including making explosives 
from SPAM.
 SPAM luncheon meat was hailed as the "miracle meat," and its shelf-stable attribut
es attracted the attention of the United States military during World War II. By 1940, 
70 percent of Americans had tried it.
 The average Hawaiian eats 12 cans of SPAM a year, followed by the average Alaskan 
with six cans, and Texans, Alabamians, and Arkansans with three cans a piece.
 If laid end to end, five billion cans of SPAM would circle the earth 12.5 times.
 100 million pounds of SPAM were issued as a Lend-Lease staple in the rations to 
American, Russian, and European troops during World War II, fueling the Normandy 
Invasion. GIs called SPAM "ham that failed the physical."
 In Khrushchev Remembers, Nikita Khrushchev credited SPAM for keeping the Soviet

Students learn writing by doing
By BEHNAM FABAHPOURTartan Staffwriter
Many students at CMU are 
taking advantage of Pittsburghs 
offerings for writers to share 
their works with others. Some 
do it for fun, while others fully 
intend to pursue writing as a 
career, but all agree that Pittsburghis a great place for a writer 
to succeed. There are manyjournals that take unsolicited 
work as well as many places 
that host readings. Both 
have proven to be very im
portant to many student 
writers on campus.
The Student Reading Se
ries, which traditionally 
changes its name each year, 
is a monthly poetry and fic
tion reading on campus.
This year, the series is en
titled Brewing Hemlock, 
while past names include 
Jaguar Mouth and 
Nickel Beer Night. The 
series mainly consists of, 
but is not restricted to, se
niors. Brewing Hemlock 
is one of the many opportu
nities on campus to get work 
read. The goal of the series 
is to prepare the readers for 
careers in writing.
It could be considered as 
a stepping stone, said Karen 
Rigby, the coordinator for this 
years series. The reading series 
gives students a chance to share 
their work and ideas with other 
writers and proves to be a valu
able learning experience. Stu
dents participating in the series 
get a taste of all kinds of literary 
material, with readings from 
poets, spoken word performers, 
essayists, and fiction writers.
Exposure to different styles 
allows writing students to fa
miliarize themselves with what 
their contemporaries are doing, 
said Rigby.
Aside from spoken work, a lot 
of students have the chance to 
have their work published in 
literary magazines. Oakland Review is one on-campus forum
that gives students the oppor
tunity to publish their work. 
Although it is produced on cam
pus, it is not restricted to CMU 
students. In fact, the Oakland Review receives submissions 
from all over the nation.
Some of the students at CMU 
take their literary work more 
seriously than others and plan 
to pursue it as a career, while 
others do it for fun and selfIts really helpful to 
see that poets like you 
are struggling with the 
same problems you are. 
It is also really impor
tant to see someone de
voting their life to it, 
then you wonder if you 
would do the same.

Tranquada
satisfaction. Nevertheless, most 
feel that it is important to share 
their, work with others.
Its really helpful to see that 
poets like you are struggling with 
the same problems you are, said 
Fiona Tranquada, a junior En
glish major. It is also really 
important to see someone devot
ing their life to it, then you won
der if you would do the same.
Students who are active in 
the literary scene get to sample 
what it is like to write profes
sionally. Whether dealing with 
deadline, or juggling writing 
with their classes, it gives them 
a taste of what the life of a 
writer is like.
I really would like to write 
more and publish more of my 
stories, said Stan Tran, a se
nior English major. I am also 
majoring in technical writing 
as a backup. I want to have a 
steady income while I write my 
short stories.
Sophomore English major 
Guilia Calla has lived in Pitts
burgh for 15 years. As a student 
in creative writing and a Pitts
burgh native, she feels that the 
citys writing community and 
the University have been very 
supportive of each 
other, both in the liter
ary scene, and in 
general.
It helps to feel a part 
of the community, 
Calla said. Because 
CMU has contributed a 
lot to the city, and Pitts
burgh has been very 
supportive of CMU. 
Although Calla 
doesnt necessarily 
plan for a career with 
her writing, she has 
had the opportunity to 
read her plays, short 
stories, and poetry.
Some students try to 
get more involved in the 
literary scene in Pitts
burgh. The scene here 
is one of the best in any 
city, said Eric 
Spaulding, a sopho
more English major. We have 
tons of readings going on at all 
times, as well as the visiting 
readers we get here at CMU 
that are fantastic.
Spaulding has read his work 
at local venues, including the 
local restaurant Fuel and 
Fuddle, which often hosts open 
mic nights.
On and off campus, there are 
numerous places for student 
writers to have their work rec
ognized. Students take advan
tage of the local scene in Pitts
burgh and on-campus opportu
nities. For many, these venues 
for performance and publica
tion are as vital to the learning 
experience as the classroom 
and, hopefully, a start to a fu
ture in writing.
By ELAINE BOLANDTartan Staffwriter
Pittsburgh does not readily 
spring into the minds of writers 
when they try to picture the 
perfect literary enviornment 
accessible ways to publish and 
perform. New York and Paris 
are commonly knows as centers 
for creative writing, but Pitts
burgh is a desirable place for 
writers to be.
One of the main ben
efits of Pittsburgh as a 
literary arena is the fact 
that it is a very close-knit 
community. Jane 
Bernstein, writer and pro
fessor of English, said of 
the Pittsburgh writing 
community, Its nice that 
we tend to know each 
other. There is a real sense 
of sharing information 
and sharing works. The 
city itself values its writ
ers and writing. Its fasci
nating to see how a poetry 
reading can pack a house.
This sense of community 
is one of the main reasons 
writers stay in Pittsburgh, 
anditis afeelingnotreadily 
available in other cities. 
Originally from New Jer
sey, Bernstein is particu
larly aware of the difference be
tween New York literary circles 
and Pittsburgh literary circles.
I felt very out of the New York 
loop in Jersey, Bernstein said. 
There are so many writersinNew 
York, and theres not so much of a 
sense of community in New York.
Jim Daniels, professor of En
glish and creative writing de
partment head, would agree 
that the Pittsburgh writing en
vironment is very much com
petitiveness.
I dont feel the tension or com
petitiveness among writers from 
the different universities, or be
tween the university-based writ
ers and those from the commu
nity on the whole. Generally, we 
all seem to know and appreciate 
each other, Daniels said.
Maurice Kilwein-Guevara, a 
professor at Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania, feels that his
tory plays a very important role 
in the success of Pittsburghs 
writing scene. He even compared 
Pittsburgh to other famous liter
ary environments such as 
Dublin, which has produced 
many noteworthy authors such 
as James Joyce, William Butler 
Yeats, and Samuel Beckett. Like
these writers, many reputable 
Pittsburgh authors find their in
spiration from the city even when 
theyre not living here.
Pittsburgh has produced a 
remarkable number of fine writ
ers: Annie Dillard, August Wil
son, Jack Gilbert, and Gerald 
Stern, just to name a few, said 
Kilwein-Guevara. As with 
Dublin, many of our best seem 
to write best about Pittsburgh 
when they are living in Iowa 
City or Paris or Minneapolis.
Kilwein-Guevara has read at 
CMU as part of the English 
Departments Visiting Writers 
Series. One of his books, Poems of the River Spirit, was pub
lished by the University of Pitts
burgh Press. He has also been a 
guest on Prosody, a radio pro
gram on WYEP hosted by Jan 
Beatty, who is an author of an 
award-winning poetry collec
tion entitled Mad River.
Prosody is just one example 
of the diversity of events and 
programs surrounding litera
ture that occur in the city. There 
are many opportunities to per
form poetry and hear readings, 
such as the International Po
etry Forum, which brings poets 
in from around the coun
try to local venues. Sun
day Night Live, which 
runs out of the City The
atre in South Side, is a 
forum for local play
wrights to have their 
work performed.
There are countless 
other venues for spoken 
word performances and 
poetry readings. Just last 
Friday, City Books on the 
South Side held a Poetry 
Slam sponsored by StandardDeviation,theGraduate Student Conference at 
Duquesne University.
Ed Gelblum of City 
Books said that programs 
like these draw all kinds 
of people and that they 
can provide valuable ex
posure for local writers. 
Any time you can get a 
public hearing, its good, he said.
While Pittsburgh has pro
duced many noteworthy au
thors, it has also been a popular 
setting for many works of fic
tion. John Edgar WidemansAZZ Stories are True depicts African 
Americans is set in the Pitts
burgh district of Homewood.
While Pittsburgh may not be 
recognized among the ranks of 
famous literary communities, it 
provides writers with a cultur
ally diverse environment in 
which to write, and one that con
tinues to attract both established 
authors and burgeoning writers. 
The countless opportunities for 
exposure and the close-knit fam
ily atmosphere contribute to 
Pittsburgh as a setting for liter
ary success.
As with Dublin, many 
of our best seem to write 
best about Pittsburgh 
when they are living in 
Iowa City or Paris or 
Minneapolis.

Bugs make it big in movie
By DEREK GREENTREETartan Assistant Production Manager
In all honesty, I went into the new 
joint venture by Disney and Pixar Ani
mation Studios, A Bug's Life, prepared 
to be disappointed. After all, its hard to 
beat the expectations that Pixars ear
lier works have built up. Famous for 
producing animated shorts, such as the 
award-winning Luxo Jr. and, more re
cently, Geris Game, Pixar made a splash 
three years ago with the release of their 
first motion picture, Toy Story. This film 
featured an amusing, original, fast-paced 
plot combined with eye-popping 3-D ani
mation and effects.i
What: A Bugs Life 
Director: John Lasseter 
Company: Pixar/Disney______
More recently, Dreamworks Pictures 
jumped on the animated film bandwagon 
with their movie Antz. As movies of this 
genre have become more popular, a real 
concern of mine was that filmmakers 
would abandon a solidly entertaining 
script in favor of eye-candy; recent mega
hyped flops such as Godzilla illustrate 
this trend. Much to my delight, Pixar 
has another winner on its hands with A Bugs Life. The movie features a unique, 
touching, and wildly funny script, blend
ing well with the spectacular, fluid ani
mation that is Pixars trademark. For
tunately, it isnt diluted by the rosycolored lenses all Disney movies seem to 
look through. Brace yourself, because 
Im going to rave.
The plot of A Bugs Life pits a colony 
of ants against a gang of grasshoppers, 
who use threats and their intimidating 
size to force the ants to collect food for 
them each year, at the time known as 
the Harvest. In a quest to rid the colony 
from the opression of the grasshoppers,
one inventive ant, Flik, trav
els into the world to find war
riors to help in defeating the 
grasshoppers. The insects 
Flik encounters and recruits 
come in a wide variety of spe
cies and attitudes, including 
a walking stick, a praying 
mantis, and a black widow 
spider. Adding to the fun, 
the vocal talents used in the 
movie are well-suited to their 
characters and work well 
with each other. Flik is voiced 
by Dave Foley of Kids In The Hall and Newsradio fame,
Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays 
Princess Atta, the young suc
cessor to the queen ant of the 
colony, and David Hyde 
Pierce adds an air of 
sopisticated humor as Slim 
the Walking Stick.
But, of course, while a good 
script is important in ani
mated films, an equally es
sential feature is the quality 
of the animation. Here, also,
Pixar doesnt fail. Bugs, grass, 
trees, and man-made objects 
are all wonderfully textured 
and lighted, and none of the 
same hurriedness is present 
that some reported when 
watchingArcte. Grasshoppers 
are ugly, frightening, and 
roughly textured; rotund cat
erpillars are realistically 
squishy. The motion, both of 
creatures and props, is be
lievable. The visuals of this 
movie are, in one word, breathtaking.
 So, in short, go see A Bugs Life when it 
opens this Thanksgiving; and heres a tip 
for when you do. Stay and watch after its 
over. Pixar, during the credit sequence, 
has included hilarious animated outtakes.
 1998 Pixar/Disney 
Dot perches atop a clover in Pixars A Bug's Life.
If you go into this movie expecting disap
pointment, as I did, be prepared to be 
pleasantly surprised. A Bugs Life builds 
upon the foundations that Toy Story laid 
and provides a thoroughly enjoyable ex
perience in the process.
Orchestra performs with talented singer
By CLINTON FIELDTartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the Pittsburgh Sym
phony Orchestra presented a mix of 
music best described by the title of the 
first piece: Honey and Rue. Each of 
the main selections mixed the lyrical 
with the discordant, leaving the lis
tener with a concoction that was defi
nitely an acquired taste.
The evening focused first on two solo 
soprano works by Andre Previn, con
ducted by the composer and sung by 
Harolyn Blackwell. Honey and Rue, a 
cycle of songs with lyrics written by the 
Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning au
thor Toni Morrison, gave Blackwell an 
opportunity to show both her vocal tal
ent and her incredibly warm stage pres
ence. Unfortunately, the work as a whole 
didnt possess the presence or the fix
ture in time and place that would have 
provided a firm base for Blackwells 
performance. Instead, the song cycle 
had the air of an experiment: an experi
ment that may lead to new possibili
ties, but an experiment nonetheless.
Morrisons six short poems could 
have easily stood on their literary 
merit alone, and were written with
out consideration for their rhythm 
and melody when sung. Maestro 
Previn used orchestral accompani
ment to mirror the literary concepts 
behind each line rather than build a 
musical theme based on the melody of 
the song. That differed fundamentally 
from the traditional use of song, where 
literary sense results more from the 
combined flow of the melody and is 
dependent on the listeners interpre
tation of the lyrics for its full effect.
The next piece, Previns Vocalise, 
consisted of little more than a short, 
straightforward melody. A vocalise 
treats the human voice as an instru
ment that uses only vowel sounds, as 
opposedto lyrics. Once again, Blackwell 
gave a masterful performance.
The evening concluded with Gustav 
Mahlers Symphony No. 4 in G Major. 
As the first movement opened, the wood; 
wind and sleigh bell theme appeared  
then faded away, only to resurface to  
haunt the rest of the movement. While ; 
the audience heard other themes, the: 
insistent sleigh bells never disappeard 
for long. By the start of the second 
movement the mood had become truly 
sinister. The concertmasters violin, 
tuned an entire tone higher than con
cert pitch, led the dance for a while, but 
the winds returned with a more cheer
ful note.
The third movement became slower 
and calmer. Crescendos swelled from 
the base of the orchestra several times 
in this movement; each gave the im
pression of something unknown be
hind the calmness. The fourth move
ment gave the final resolution, with; 
Blackwell returning to sing of the per
fect life waiting in heaven. Even here, 
however, the orchestra grew uncer
tain and slightly discordant as the 
song turned to the animals that must 
be slaughtered to mak the perfect 
heavenly feasts.
Overall, Harolyn Blackwell and the^ 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra gave 
a consistently nd thoroughly excel
lent performance. Whatever questions 
the compositions may have raised 
about themselves, there can be no ques' 
tion as to the caliber of the performers.
New studio fills void for space
By ROSIE JONESTartan Staffwriter
Exhibiting artists need space. 
Its a common theme. They break 
into abandoned warehouses and 
exhibit in shop windows. Getting 
a show in a conventional gallery 
is a game of subtle whoring with 
gallery owners, a cut-throat busi
ness where those who succeed 
are not those with the most artis
tic talent, but those with the most 
developed skills of brown-nosing. 
And thats after the artwork has 
been completed. Before that, they 
. need studio space. And not just 
any old studio space, but studio 
space where they can feel at home.
Rick Schweikert moved to Pitts
burgh with a novel model: the 
artist as an unexploited market 
; in real estate. Investors purchase 
' run-down warehouses, bring it 
up to the building code, and lease 
space to artists and others at rates 
well below those of conventional 
office-spaces, and with conditions 
better than in traditional, collectively-run studios. The result is 
; Viaduct Studios and Warehouse
 "Workshop, a space downtown that 
houses performance artists, 
painters, sculptors, and even a 
little virtual reality.
By favoring artists, were ca
tering to a forgotten market, said 
Schweikert, a playwright who 
: devised and executed the plan and 
! is now residing as the buildings 
; superintendent. These people 
have been compromised and
marginalized, and were catering 
to their needs, he added. The 
building is almost entirely leased 
and the group is now working on 
developing another building.
Viaduct Studios held an open 
house aptly named Visiting 
Hours last Saturday, to show 
the Warehouse Workshop to the 
public. The open house was a 
unique opportunity to meet the
alone, but'know that others are 
around. People are supportive. 
She explained that many people 
find themselves isolated when 
they leave art school, working 
long hours alone in their studios.
Bull Seal, a performance art 
group, uses their space in the 
building for rehearsals. Bull 
Seal held a performance in the 
building during the open house
"These [artists] have been compro
mised and marginalized, and we're 
catering to their needs. 
 Rick Schweikert
artists in residence and learn how 
the project is suiting them.
Ray Gerard, a commercial pho
tographer, has found the Ware
house Workshop to be a place 
where he can work comfortably. 
In studio spaces where he has 
worked in the past, landlords 
didnt maintain the building. 
Other landlords use artists, he 
explained. After youve fixed up 
your space, they dont renew your 
lease  then they rent it to 
yuppies at jacked-up prices.
Linn Meyers is a painter who 
recently moved to Pittsburgh from 
the West Coast. This is a great 
building with great artists, and a 
really community-oriented 
feel,she said. The doors are al
ways open. Here you can work
and described themselves as a 
Human Laboratory.
Also working in the building 
are Virtual Motion, a virtual real
ity software company. This is an 
eclectic bunch of tenants, said 
Bill Heckel of Virtual Motion.
The Viaduct Studios and the 
Warehouse Workshops provide 
local artists with reasonablypriced studio space and a cre
ative environment to work in. 
The open house held last Sat
urday gave local artists an op
portunity to showcase their 
work and their studio space. By 
building such establishments, 
artists hope to provide Pitts
burgh with places that encour
age creativity and fellowship in 
the local art scene.

Tricky will never let us com
pletely into his dark world. His 
brand of trip-hop seems to remain 
hidden from intimacy, even when 
performed live at a small club. Tra
ditionally, seeing an artist perform 
live at a small venue reveals some
thing about that artist that a fan 
otherwise would not have known. 
Tricky, however, quite literally 
shrouded himself and his band in 
darkness on Wednesday night at 
Metropol. For most of the show, 
only Trickys convulsing silhouette 
was visible as he rapped, barked, 
and growled into the microphone, 
while a red light would occasion
ally fall across his face, giving it a 
demonic quality.
Tricky was thrust into the spot
light as a teenager in 1990. As 
part of Massive Attack, Trickys 
laid-back rapping style on the 
landmark Blue Lines distin
guished him from others in the 
group. After meeting Martina 
Topley-Byrd, who would become 
his full-time collaborator and road 
partner, Tricky released the bril
liant debut Maxinquaye in 1995. 
The album oozes grooves, samples, 
beats, Martinas crooning, and 
Trickys rapping. Its been called 
music for the morning after.
His later worksPre-Millenium Tension and Angels with Dirty Faces  were inten
tional departures from the style 
he created. Tricky sought differ
entiation from the flood of sub
standard trip-hop that followed 
his debut, and, for better or for
worse, he got it. His later albums 
darker, paranoid textures proved 
challengingto some fans, and they 
didnt have the cohesion of their 
predecessors. Unfortunately, 
much of the material for the show 
came from the latter two albums 
and didnt consist of the better 
material. What resulted was a 
dreary, droning show inter
spersed with a few great perfor
mances of Maxinquaye songs.
The first few songs in the nights 
set followed a pattern  Tricky 
performed a dark, aggressive 
track, then Topley-Byrd did a 
softer crowd-pleaser, usually a 
track from Maxinquaye. This flipflop was made even more appar
ent because the vocalist who 
wasnt performing had his or her 
back turned to the audience. A 
disappointment was that he chose 
not to duet with Topley-Byrd, as 
he had done on many of the stu
dio versions. Hearing Trickys 
cracked voice speaking the same 
lyrics that Topley-Byrd sings 
makes for an intriguing listening 
experience, one that was genu
inely missed at the show.
One of the most surprising 
things about the show was how 
well his earlier songs translated 
to the stage. Tricky used very 
little of the original samples, re
lying instead on his live band - a 
guitarist, a bassist, and a drum
mer. The reconstruction that 
some of the tracks such as 
Abbaon Fat Track underwent 
was striking. Other highlights 
were the comparatively giddy 
Ponderosa, which featured 
Topley-Byrds best performance

of the night.
Despite Trickys lessthan-stellar main set, the crowd called him 
back for an encore. The encore, 
sadly, was nothing short of de
plorable. First came a bizarre re
working of Hell is Around the 
Comer. Where there once was a 
smooth sample of Isaac Hayes, all 
that remained were monotonous 
guitars, an obnoxious drumbeat, 
and Tricky vocalizing as angrily 
as he had earlier in the night. The 
closing track, Vent, began like 
the album version. However, some 
eight minutes of droning and 
snarling later, he had lost much of 
the audience. The show was rather 
anti-climactic.
Like the ending, the show no
ticeably lacked some of the ele
ments which make Trickys mu
sical efforts so distinctive. Tricky 
certainly doesnt play down to his 
audience, but the concert as a 
whole still remained in too much 
of a haze.

Romper Stomper
You may have become familiar with New Zealand 
actor Russell Crow when he starred in last years 
critical darling L.A. Confidential. In it he played 
an impulsively violent and semi-corrupt cop who 
was willing to beat up witnesses, shove the D.A.s 
head in the toilet, and almost anything else to 
make sure justice was served. Well, that film 
showed Crowes softer side when compared to his 
character in Romper Stomper. He plays Hando, 
the leader of a group of Australian Neo-Nazis who 
believe that all of Australias problems stem from 
the growing Vietnamese population which is ruin
ing the purity of their country. So, they go around 
brutalizing all the Vietnamese citizens they can 
find. Finally, they meet a group that they cant 
handle and are forced to go into hiding. With no one 
else left to fight against, the group starts to selfdestruct. So at least it has a happy ending.

Snake Eyes
I hope that I am just being cautious, but I think 
that Nicolas Cage has developed a serious case of 
AlPacinoitis. Its a rare disease that is devastating 
in that it only seems to hit incredible actors. 
Symptoms include the propensity to yell, rather 
than act. Unfortunately, Cage does just that in this 
Brian De Palma film concerning the murder of the 
Secretary of Defense during a boxing match in 
Atlantic City. When we first meet Cages charac
ter, corrupt cop Rick Santoro, hes yelling. Then 
the Secretary is shot, and he yells some more. 
Later, he tries to convince other people that the 
murder was a conspiracy the best way he knows 
how: yelling. The end of the film sees him outside 
yelling into a hurricane. This horrible disease 
must be stopped before it hits someone else. Show 
him Devils Advocate if you must, but stop him!

Armageddon
If we are to learn anything from last summers 
movies its this: Move out of New York City as 
quickly as you possibly can. Be it by tidal wave or 
by giant lizard, the city is just plain doomed. This 
time the destructive force is a couple of asteroids 
which wipe out NYC in a matter of minutes. 
However, even though the countrys leading me
tropolis is destroyed, the government still man
ages to keep it under wraps. And do you know why? 
Because there is another asteroid coming, and this 
time its the size of Texas. And that means the 
end of life on earth as we know it. Sad. So, the 
governments only hope is to send up a rag tag 
team of oil drillers to bore into the center of the 
asteroid and plant a nuclear device there, thus 
saving the earth and proving once again that 
Americans kick ass.

Ok, robotics people, this is addressed to you. 
Please do whatever is in your power to create 
robots that do NOT go insane and start killing 
people at the slightest provocation. I mean, all it 
took for these robots to begin their mad mall killing 
spree was a little thunderstorm. They started off 
with a little security guard slaying, and thats fine. 
But, once they moved on to those poor defenseless 
teenagers.... Well, that is until the teenagers found 
that sporting goods store with all the semi-auto
matic weapons. And so I say, think before you

God Is My Co-Pilot
Get Busy  Atavistic
With Get Busy, God Is My CoPilots ninth album (and 37th re
lease), the band doesnt tread much 
new ground. Unlike most other 
bands, this isnt necessarily a bad 
thing. The groups hallmark is their 
ability to integrate various genres 
into a coherent whole, which makes 
them sound fresh on each album.
Like most of GodCos albums, 
this one is yet another confusing
mixture of punk, indie rock, 
country, free jazz, klezmer, 
noise, waltz, and folk. Perhaps 
the only thing keeping the mu
sic together are lyrics about the 
trials and tribulations of bisexu
ality. Even then, the messages 
are sometimes in Swedish and 
Finnish, thus reducing the 
chance of lyrical monotony.
There are plenty ofhigh points 
on this record. While the opener, 
Menarche, is standard indie 
rock fare, Chase Scene goes 
courtesy Atavistic into atypical brassy funk. Mon
keys, a song in Finnish, Swedish, 
and French, has a slow, deliberate 
sound influenced by Fugazi. Most 
surprising of all is Gras ach 
Granbarr, a song with both an 
80s new wave sound and an ex
perimental noise rock slant.
This isnt the best place for a 
future GodCo listener to start 
(for that, Id recommend The Best of God Is My Co-Pilot). However, 
this record is a solid and highly 
recommended release for people 
unafraid of adventurous music.

Exhibit features Art Deco relics
By RHYS CONLONTartan Staffwriter
Two years ago, before James Cameron had 
even finished casting Titanic, the Carnegie 
Museum of Art began restoring art from an 
alternative vessel, the French cruise liner, Normandie.
On Saturday, November 7, five pieces which 
delighted travelers during the ships 1935 to 
1941 commission were officially added to the 
museums collection. The Chariot of Aurora, a 
large-scale relief mural created by Frenchmen 
Jean Dupas and Jean Dunand, is the most 
prominent aspect of the exhibit, but all of the 
work mirrors the Art Deco movement, which 
surrounded Normandie's French port at the 
time. A.M. Cassandres popular lithograph of 
the Normandie, Durands Pair of Doors, Ameri
can Peter Muller-Monks silver Normandie Pitcher, and Dupas charcoal and graphite 
sketch of The Chariot of Aurora are also in
cluded in the space.
The term Art Deco has evolved and become 
somewhat ambiguous since the movement 
originated in France after World War I. How
ever, it is generally based on the concept of 
combining industry and art, and in Normandie's case, architecture and art.
Rather than having architects create rooms 
which were merely fit to display artwork,
artists built structures that were decora
tions in and of themselves. The notion was 
not surprising; church architecture, for in
stance, had traditionally included art. But 
Art Deco work was simplified, reflecting the 
modern advancements in Western industry 
and machinery and the desires for mass 
production.The Chariot of Aurora is one example of 
how a practical architectural element, a 
wall, may also serve as an illustration. 
Aboard the ship, the artists not only utilized 
the wall in a unique fashion but also por
trayed the ships surroundings, the sea. The 
plaster relief, was then layered with gold, 
silver, and copper Japanese lacquer to give 
it the luxuriant quality that many had been 
missing during the late 20s and 30s partly 
due to the worldwide depression.
Having at one time reached from the floor 
to the ceiling of the ships Grand Salon, The Chariot of Aurora blends Greek mythology 
with navigational components and shows 
the passing of a day. Aurora, who was the 
daughter of Hyperion, the Sun God, is shown 
in the lower left-hand corner with a torch as 
dawn, and again in the lower right-hand 
comer as dusk, catching a star. In both 
pictures, she stands near a four-horse 
chariot and looks up at flocks of birds and at 
her sons, the four winds. Resting above her,
the sons contribute to the pieces symmetry; 
each brother looks across at another, two 
lying above dawn and two lying above dusk.
But the figures are not the sole focus; the 
importance of nature, for example, is evident 
throughout the piece. The entire background 
consists of waves and clouds, which is fitting, 
as nature has often been a crucial aspect of 
navigation, especially at sea. In addition, a 
compass rose is set in the center panel, and 
the N, S, E, and O surrounding it are clearly 
French abbreviations for north, south, east, 
and west. However, its golden color and elon
gated rays suggest that it is also a depiction 
of the sun. Together, the compass, sun, winds, 
and evening stars all work with one another 
to illustrate oceanic navigation.
In the museum, polished white walls bor
der The Chariot of Aurora, and it takes the 
form of a work of art rather than that of a 
retractable wall. The doors, which were once 
built into the scene itself, now hang across 
the room under glass window boxes. How
ever, even though the practicality is gone, 
the room provides the viewer with an ad
equate history of the Normandie and is aes
thetically pleasing. The small size of the 
room forces you to look closely at the artistic 
architecture and allows you to grasp a better 
sense of what it may have been like to sail on 
the Normandie.Play makes better night than algorithms
BECCA FRIBUSHTartan Forum Editor
In many ways, Arcadia is an 
ideal play for CMU. It features 
geeks frothing at the mouth about 
algorithms, loads of intellectual 
innuendo, and prodigious re
search feats. The Tom Stoppard 
play, which Scotch n Soda per
formed last week, deals with the 
pleasures of exploration and dis
covery  whether of history, sci
ence, or human nature.
All of the CMU productions 
actors played their parts skill
fully, but sometimes their dic
tion was a little difficult to un
derstand. This, coupled with the 
fact that long, densely allusive 
monologues about thermody
namics and Romantic poetry are 
easier to follow when you can 
read them, almost made me think 
I could have gotten more by read
ing the text closely to myself a 
few times. Yet Scotch n Soda 
did do an impressive job of bring
ing Arcadia to life.Arcadia tells the story of two 
sets of characters separated by 
almost two centuries. It alter
nates between scenes featuring
the early-19th-century Coverley 
family and guests at their En
glish country house and scenes 
about modern-day Coverley de
scendants. In 1809 13-year-old 
genius Thomasina Coverley 
(Nikki McCrea) is seeking to dis
cover new types of geometry, 
while tutor Septimus Hodge (Ben 
Emest-Jones), is embroiled in a 
couple of exotic love triangles of 
his own. He loves Thomasinas 
mother, Lady Croom (Christine 
Tarbet), who lusts after the poet 
Lord Byron. But he was also 
caught in the gazebo romancing 
Lady Chater, whose husband 
Ezra (Ashish Venupogal), now 
feels the need to defend his honor 
violently. More quietly, these 
scenes also deal with Thomasinas 
intellectual and emotional ma
turing and her deepening rela
tionship with Septimus.
The present-day Coverleys 
have invited Hannah (Olga 
Massov), a cultural historian, to 
the estate to write a history of its 
landscaped gardens. Hannah, lit
erary scholar Bernard (Michael 
Bode), and Valentine Coverley 
(Chris Hardouin), whos study
ing math at Oxford, all are on the
verge of discov
eries in their 
fields. These 
discoveries all 
depend on the 
characters we 
met in 1809.
Hannah wants 
to find the iden
tity of the mys
terious hermit 
who once lived 
in the garden,
Bernard be
lieves hes on 
the verge of 
proving that Lord Byron killed 
Ezra Chater in a duel, and Valen
tine Sworking with algorithmic 
models of the natural world, us
ing techniques similar to ones 
that Thomasina developed in her 
spare time. As the play continues 
alternating between times, the 
real events that happened slowly 
reveal themselves to the modern 
characters and the audience.
The entire play takes place in 
the same room of the Coverley 
estatethe productions set and 
lighting do an impressive job of 
setting a mood without upstag
ing the characters. The use of the

same set, props, and furniture for 
both sets of characters highlights 
the sense of continuity between 
past and present. The books and 
notes that the 1809 characters 
casually use become the histori
cal artifacts that the modem char
acters pore over.
Our relationship to the past is 
just one of the many themes 
touched on in Arcadia. Stoppards 
thoughtful play and the cast and

for intellectual entertainment

algorithms, but a lot more fun.

Sometimes when you're walking around campus, 
you will see an atrocious-looking person with a 
zit-marked face. While it isn't polite to stare or 
make fun of the person, you can't help but wonder if 
they use Noxema or see a dermatologist. The fact 
remains, zits are eye-catching. While you'll never read 
in some dirty romance novel a description like "his glis
tening golden hair framed his oozing, pussy zits so ele
gantly," zits rank up there with beautiful smile and 
prominent booger as noticeable features. Acne affects 
most teenagers to some extent, but it isn't restricted to 
any age group. Adults in their 20s, even up to their 40s, 
can get acne. It is important to remember not to treat 
people with acne as subhuman because it isn't caused 
by dirt. The black in a blackhead is dried oil and shed 
skin cells in the openings of the hair follicles. For normal 
care of the skin, wash your face with soap and warm 
water twice a day. Washing too often can make acne 
worse. Of course, there are other matters that the Amer
ican Academy of Dermatology want you to think about: 
nails and hair. If you're into into painting nails, long fin- 
gemails are acceptable. On the other hand, being some 
kind of freaky Goth person and having long fingernails 
is not. The same goes for hair. Short hair is nice. When a 
person has short hair, they are at less risk for having 
insects trying to breed in there. Lice have less room to 
~play hide-and-seek. Maybe there are people out there 
who like having little creatures travelling across the 
great expanse of their scalp, but it isn't very sanitary. To 
learn more about the bad things that you can do to your
self and your skin, visit the American Academy of Der
matology Web site at http://www.aad.org. There is infor
mation on different conditions and also some links to 
help you find a dermatologist.
