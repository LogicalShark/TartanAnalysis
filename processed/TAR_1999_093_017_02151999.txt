Students turned out in droves to enjoy the freakish spring-like atmosphere last Thursday.
Students explore careers at job fair
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
Last Monday, as students passed by 
Rangos Hall, they probably caught a 
glimpse of the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences (H&SS) Job Fair, 
a relatively small gathering of em
ployers seeking to recruit students.
While not anywhere near as large as 
the Business Opportunities Conference 
(BOC) and Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC), the fair provided a 
way for non-technical majors to search 
for internships and job positions.
More job fairs need to occur at CMU. 
BOC and TOC are so big that its n^ce to 
have a smaller one for [H&SS] stu
dents, said John Watson, a junior in 
information and decision systems (IDS).
The fair is in its third year, and 
featured 20 companies that ranged 
from the Peace Corps and Mercy 
Behavioral Health to regulars 
at other fairs like IBM and 
Andersen Consulting.
IBM recruiter Michael Dickerson listed 
opportunities in financing and account
ing, and human resources. The biggest 
opportunity is with EDS, he said.
Greg Janssen, the on-site campus 
manager for Caterpillar, Inc. agreed. 
The majors we are looking for out of
H&SS are technical writers and IDS, 
he said Greg Janssen.
The ideal would be to have some
thing there for practically every ma
jor. Professional writing [and] public 
relations, dont have the number of 
jobs available, said Beth Miller, as
sistant to the dean of H&SS and the 
fairs organizer. I would probably 
say IDS seems to be the most soughtafter major.
Miller noted one addition to the fair 
that did cater to non-technical writing
 South Arts, a small arts organiza
tion located in Pittsburgh.
[We are] looking for interns want
ing to work in arts management, teach
ing, and gallery operations, said Ruth 
D. Richardson, president of the South 
Arts board. She listed art, writing, 
communication, and teaching as the 
types of skills that she was looking for.
This is our first time at the job fair. 
Id thought it would be worth stop
ping by to get some exposure, said 
Rob Wallace, a recruiter for Mercy 
Behavioral Health. He said his 
compnay sougy psychology majors. 
Were looking for people to work with 
people with disabilities.
However, some students thought 
there could have been a 
different focus.
Its a good opportunity aside from 
the BOC and TOC, said Lidiana 
Rivera, a second-year Heinz School 
graduate student. Pointing to the Bu
reau of Labor Statistics and the Penn
sylvania State Civil Service Commis
sion, she added [But] I think it should 
focus more on the public sector.
Miller said that, in planning for 
the fair, hundreds of companies and 
organizations were contacted, 
though only 20 showed up. She also 
said that the number of students 
registering at the fair has dropped 
to 300, from about 340 students the 
previous two years.
In addition to the 20 companies 
represented at tables, the fair of
fered an opportunity for students to 
drop off their resumes for about 12 
other companies. The resume drop 
included companies such as 
Sterlinghouse Publishing and 
American Management Systems.
Miller said that in the future she 
would like to see more companies 
that cater to the needs of humani
ties students.
I really encourage H&SS students 
to get involved, and to do employer 
research, said Miller. This year there 
wasnt a lot of student involvement. I 
would like to see more involvement.

Students undergraduate tuition 
for Fall 1999 will be increased by 
3.9 percent from $21,275 to 
$22,100. This increase is one of 
the smallest in the past five years.
A combination of factors went 
into this years tuition increase, 
said Jared L.
Cohon, presidentoftheUniversity. This 
increase in 
incomewill go 
towards more 
coursework, 
extracurricu
lar activities, 
and salaries.
We are com
mitted to pro
viding our un
dergraduates 
an education of 
the highest 
caliber.
Cohon ad
dressed the 
reason the
Universitys endowment, another 
source of income that comes from 
the interest earned from the schools 
savings accoun, doesnt cover these 
expenses. Our endowment is rela
tively small compared to other universitiesin our bracket, said Cohon. 
The income from the endowment 
represents six percent of our total 
annual budget.
We use a significant amount 
of the endowment every year, 
said Jeff Bolton, vice president 
for business planning and chief 
financial officer. Lastfiscalyear, 
our endowment was $654 mil
lion. We take 5.5 percent of the 
three-year moving average of the 
market value of the endowment.

returns to campusFilm crew

Later this week, CMU students 
will once again be able to witness 
Wonder Boys in action. Along with 
Michael Douglas, Robert Downey 
Jr., and Frances McDormand, the 
films stars, and Curtis Hanson, the 
director, the crew will be on campus 
once again for filming from Febru
ary 18-20.
CMU will have to make certain 
accommodations for the produc
tion once again. The University 
will close off the CFA parking lot 
and relocate various music and 
drama classes which would ordi
narily take place in the CFA build
ing. According to Don Hale, vice 
president of public relations, the 
interferences will be minor.
I appreciate that people have 
been patient, but filming is a big 
production, said Hale. Adminis
trative groups that have been in
volved have done a wonderful job of 
relocating things, said Hale.
According to Jeff Stimmel, lo
cation manager for the movie, 
the CFA lot will be used as a set 
for one of the scenes in which
Michael Douglass character 
drives into the school. He is then 
confronted by actor Toby 
McGuires character, and the two 
have an extensive conversation.
. It is a vital location. Hopefully 
it will be painless, and occur at 
night, said Stimmel.
Most of the complaints we have 
received have been about park
ing, said Hale. However, the 
parking shortage that was caused 
by the filming at the beginning of 
the month, will lessen due to the 
fact that much of the upcoming 
filming will take place at night, 
according to Hale. When the film 
crew returns, for its last days of 
shooting during springbreak, few 
will be bothered.
In order to compensate for the 
adjustments that had to be made 
within the Music and Drama 
Schools, the film pays a daily 
locations fee. The film also pays 
for the various campus services, 
including facilities management 
and campus police. [CMU has 
been] very helpful, very pro-film, 
said Stimmel.
Stimmel also said that the rea
son why Hanson chose CMU as 
his site for Wonder Boys was be
cause it is one of the more scenic
campuses in Pittsburgh, where 
the story takes place. Unlike 
Pitt, [CMU] is positioned so 
you can see downtown Oak
land, the cathedral, and the 
background, he said. When 
Curtis Hanson got here, he re
ally liked the hills, the weird 
architecture, and the way 
things are laid out.
Despite the disruptions on 
campus, Hale said the film 
seems to be a positive thing for 
CMU. The University will be 
a significant part of the film. 
[Its an] opportunity for the 
campus to shine, he said. I 
saw a pretty large crowd [last 
time]. It brings an excitement 
to the campus. It provides a 
chance to see a major motion 
picture produced.
Hale also believes that 
the filming shows one way that 
CMU can be more involved 
with the local community. 
The University says it is com
mitted to supporting the re
gion economically, said 
Hale. This provides an oppor
tunity. Were trying to do 
our part. There is a financial 
benefit, and we believe it is 
of value.
Purnell Center construction 
moves to interior of building
By ASEEM S. GUPTA found in very few locations in the US, ncluding

University raises prices
Stacey Tetzlaff/Tartan Photo Staff 
The second and third floors of the apse will contain faculty offices.
For many students passing by Purnell 
Center, it may seem that the feverish con
struction work that was visible last semes
ter has slowed down. On the contrary, 
with much of the exterior complete, atten
tion has shifted to the inside of the new 
Purnell Center, where the interior of the 
building, to be complete in August, is 
coming together.
Faculty should be able to move in by 
September, and the rest of the building 
should be ready for use later on in the fall, 
said Tom Murphy, project manager for the 
Purnell Center. Murphy also said that con
struction work is currently on schedule.
In the last three months the interior of 
the building has rapidly taken shape  
most of the inside walls are in place. Some 
of the aspects of the building nearing 
completion include the theater and dance, 
movement, and acting studios on the third 
floor of the building.
The floors in the movement, dance, and 
acting studios are designed to prevent in
jury, said Peter Frisch, head of the School 
of Drama. Frisch added that the new floors, 
which are filled with air, are able to bend to 
absorb the energy of actors and dancers, 
providing for less stress-related injury. The 
floors are rare and, according to Frisch, are
Also on the third floor of the building are 
unique drafting rooms in which natural light 
is the primary source of lighting. These rooms 
have skylights and large windows that give 
the feeling of space and provide an abundance 
of natural light. said Frisch. In addition to the 
windows there are views from all of the third 
floor rooms because Purnell is built on the top 
of a steep hill that overlooks much of Oakland.
Connected to the building on the second and 
third floor is the Miller Gallery.
[The Gallery] may end up housing related 
events and also being used for certain parties, 
said Frisch. The third floor of the building also 
features the unique bay windows and a small 
balcony overlooking the rest of the first and 
second floors of the expansive gallery.
The remainder of the third floor is made up 
of faculty offices reaching from the rear of the 
building, where the Miller Gallery is situated, 
to the front where the grand semi-circular 
enclosure, called the apse, is located.
The apse will contain faculty offices on the 
second and third floors as well as the primary 
reception for the building. The first floor of the 
apse houses the lobby of the building and the 
main entrance to the theater, the primary 
focus of the center.
Most of the first floor of Purnell is domi
nated by its nearly complete theater that will

Federal judge holds strikers in contempt
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP)  An 
irate federal judge on Saturday held 
American Airlines pilots union and 
two top board members in contempt 
and promised sizable fines against 
them, saying the union did not do 
enough to encourage pilots to return 
to work after a court order.
More than half a million travelers 
have been left at the gate by the nations 
second-largest airline because of the 
large number of pilots calling in sick.
Although U.S. District Judge Joe 
Kendall had ordered the pilots Wednes
day to quit their job action stemming 
from a dispute with management, about 
1,700of the airlines9,400pilots remained 
on the sick list Saturday afternoon at the 
Fort Worth, Texas-based airline.
That number was down from about 
2,443 on Friday, and airline officials 
seemed optimistic operations soon 
would return to normal.
It will take a couple of days for 
American to get all its flights rein
stated as flights are added to the sched
ule, spokesman Tim Smith said in a 
message on the companys hotline af
ter the judges ruling.
Kendall said he would decide Febru
ary 17 how much to fine the Allied Pilots 
Association, union President Rich 
LaVoy, and union Vice President Brian 
Mayhew. The judge chided them for 
what he suggested was a short-sighted 
approach to relations with the company.
Unfortunately, the radical element 
that seems to be in control of the Allied 
Pilots Association seems determined 
to fly American Airlines into the side 
of a mountain, taking themselves, the 
company, their co-workers, and their 
customers with them, Kendall said.
The judge indicated the fine and re
lated damages would be eight figures 
and ordered that the union set aside 
$10 million, or about a quarter of its net 
worth, in a bond to pay it. He ordered 
LaVoy to setaside $10,000 and Mayhew 
$5,000. LaVoy and Mayhew, both pi
lots, earned more than $200,000 last 
year, mainly doing work for the union.
A spokesman for AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines, which 
had asked Kendall to declare the union 
in contempt, said officials had 
mixed emotions.
Were gratified with the judges or
der but clearly disappointed it has 
come to this, said spokesman Chris 
Chiames. A majority of our pilots are 
doing their jobs and we hope the rest 
come back real soon.
LaVoy said he was not surprised. He 
plans to review his options with his 
lawyers before deciding whether to 
appeal. We obviously dont agree with 
the judges order, he said, adding that 
the union would continue to comply. 
Union members have been calling in 
sick and refusing to accept overtime 
since February 6 in a dispute concern
ing how quickly American should in
tegrate the pilots from recently pur
chased Reno Air into its own roster.
American officials said that 5,600 
flights have been canceled since 
the work action began, costing Ameri
can between $67 and $90 million, 
Chiames said.
At Los Angeles International Air
port, lines at the American Airlines 
terminal were shorter than they had 
been the past several days.
What an inconvenience, said Gor
don Gibson, a Los Angeles building 
contractor heading to a vacation in Rio 
de Janeiro. I was on the phone for 
hours this morning trying to find out 
whether my flight was still on, and 
now Im spending hours at the airport 
trying to get the ticket for my canceled 
flight validated.
Kendall said he did not believe the 
union leadership sincerely tried to get 
members to go back to work after he 
ordered them to do so.
No one can make someone go fly an 
airplane, particularly if someone is 
dishonest and willing to lie and say 
they are sick when they really arent, 
Kendall added. But what a federal 
judge can do  and what I will do  is 
make people pay for what they break.
Pittsburgh police 
arrest own man
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A white police 
officer suspected of authoring a Web 
page with racist overtones was arrested 
in the shooting death of a black motorist.
Jeffrey Cooperstein turned himself in 
Thursday to face possible murder and 
manslaughter charges in the December 
21 death of Deron Grimmitt during a 
police chase. Cooperstein claims he shot 
Grimmitt in self-defense because he 
feared the motorist would run him over.
Police wanted to question Grimmitt, 
32, as to why he slowed down while he 
passed officers making a drug arrest. 
One officer testified that police were on 
edge after a drive-by shooting the previ
ous night and feared Grimmitt was plan
ning to shoot them.
But testimony in a coroners inquest 
established that Grimmitt was shot 
through the side window in the side of 
the head, not head-on  as might be 
expected if he were driving toward 
Cooperstein. Cooperstein was standing 
behind his car when he shot Grimmitt.
Authorities looking for a motive for 
murder are investigating whether 
Cooperstein is the so-called Blue Knight, 
an anonymous police officer behind the 
Web site.
Theres issues touching on racial ani
mus, talking about finding the right 
victim, said Allegheny County District 
Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. You need 
malice if youre going to get a charge 
on murder.
The Web page blasts the Pittsburgh 
police department and defends five white 
suburban officers who suffocated black 
motorist Jonny Gammage after a traffic 
stop on October 12, 1995.
If you get out of your car and fight 
with me on a traffic stop, for whatever 
dysfunctional cause you have, I will feel 
remorse when you die for that cause, but 
I will go home to see my child in the 
morning, the Blue Knight writes. Dont 
talk to me about rules, and dont talk to 
me about race.
In a recent interview with the Tribune-Revieu) of Pittsburgh, Cooperstein, 
43, said he can neither confirm nor 
deny he is the Blue Knight.
Cooperstein has an unlisted number 
and could not be reached for comment
Friday. His attorney, David Trautman, 
did not immediately return a 
call for comment.
Cooperstein was released on $100,000 
bail Thursday, a day after he was sus
pended from the force without pay for 
allegedly violating department rules and 
regulations. A judge will determine the 
severity of the criminal charges 
against Cooperstein.
Plan to buy Lycos 
might not happen
NEW YORK (AP)  USA Networks 
Inc.s plans to buy Web gateway Lycos 
Inc. appeared in jeopardy Thursday as 
Lycos largest shareholder started wa
vering in its support of the $22 billion 
deal because of a sharp decline in Lycos 
stock price.
CMGI Inc., a venture capital firm that 
owns 20 percent of Lycos, said it wouldnt 
vote for the deal if Lycos stock price didnt 
recover from its two-day, 31 percent drop.
USA Networks wants to forge a threeway deal, merging its cable television 
network with Lycos, which provides 
Internet search and information ser
vices, and Ticketmaster Online 
Citysearch, an online seller of tickets to 
concerts and other events.
CMGIs original statement in support 
of the deal was drowned out by sellorders from other investors in Lycos and 
Ticketmaster who felt they were getting 
a raw deal.
Lycos shares, which fell from $127.25 
to $87 in two days, got a boost Thursday 
from speculation that the deal would 
either be scrapped or sweetened. Lycos 
shares rose 18 percent to close at $103.25 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Ticketmaster shares, which had fallen 
35 percent to $37.50 in the two-day 
selloff, recovered slightly on Thursday, 
closing at $39.37.
Some credited the stocks partial re
bound on bullish analysts hawking the 
virtues of the deal.
Paul Noglows, a financial analyst with 
Hambrecht & Quist, upgraded his rec
ommendation to a strong buy from a 
buy early Thursday, reiterating that 
the combined company would be an elec
tronic commerce powerhouse.
Nevertheless, the retreat by CMGI 
reflects broader concern that the deal
benefits shareholders of USA Networks 
more than shareholders of Lycos. 
Lycos investors were offered 
less than the $127.25 closing price of 
their stock late Monday, instead of 
the fat premium typically showered 
on shareholders in merged 
Internet companies.
Japanese experts 
find gold deposit
TOKYO (AP)Large sulfide deposits 
inside underwater volcanoes south of 
Tokyo could contain vast amounts of 
gold and silver, Japanese geologists 
said Friday.
About 200 tons of gold and 12,000 tons 
of silver are believed contained inside 
the deposits, said Makoto Yuasa, head 
of marine geology at the Agency of In
dustrial Science and Technology.
A team of agency geologists believe 
the deposits contain a total of 10 million 
tons of metals, Yuasa said. He said the 
deposits width and thickness 
are unknown.
The probe is part of a government 
project going on since the 1970s to find 
undersea deposits. But Yuasa doubted 
the latest discovery would lead to a Japa
nese gold rush.
. Its so deep that I would think com
mercial mining is a bit unrealistic, 
he said.
But Yuasa said the deposits were still 
being formed and were a unique chance 
for scientists to see the process in action. 
Similar deposits found on land finished 
forming millions of years before.
Because of the continuing volcanic 
activity, the site is still spouting hot 
water  with temperatures as high as 
536 degrees  from dozens of black 
chimney-like columns of minerals, 
Yuasa said.
It took the team 10 underwater explo
ration trips since 1997 to find the de
posit after 15 years of observation from 
boats, Yuasa said.
The deposit sits on the eastern rim of 
Myojin Knoll Caldera in the Pacific, 235 
miles south of Tokyo. The caldera, a 
volcanic crater, is more than four miles 
in diameter and up to one mile deep, 
he said.
He suggested that there might be simi
lar deposits in other previously undetec
ted submarine calderas.
Washington returns to daily business after impeachment trial
WASHINGTON (AP)  After 
a year of scandal and shame, 
President Clinton now must try 
to rebuild his tarnished presi
dency. Surprisingly, he may dis
cover some unlikely allies among 
the Republicans who tried to force 
him from office.
No matter what, Clinton will 
go into the history books with the 
humiliating distinction of being 
only the second president ever 
impeached. His challenge is to 
make historians write 
in the next paragraph 
that he was a successful presi
dent nevertheless.
Republicans are in trouble too. 
Their zest for impeachment back
fired and angered voters, who 
concluded the GOP was more in
terested in lynching Clinton than 
in fixing Social Security, Medi
care, and HMOs. Republicans 
sagged in the polls as Clinton 
soared.
Clinton and his Republican 
adversaries share a common need 
to persuade voters that they can 
get things done. The president 
wants to repair his legacy; the 
Republicans want to save their 
political skins. Both sides are 
angling for advantage in the 
2000 elections.
The Republicans are as des
perate for success as Bill Clinton 
is, said Democratic consultant 
Dane Strother.
Is there going to be personal 
affection? No, said Ralph Reed, 
a Republican strategist. Is there
going to be a mutual institutional 
desire to get something done to 
save themselves in 2000? Yes. 
Clinton doesnt want to lose the 
White House, and the Republi
cans dont want to lose the Con
gress. Theyre more apt to lose if 
they get nothing done.
Clinton steered his way through 
the impeachment minefield 
by proclaiming himself dedicated 
to the peoples business and championing politically popular 
causes such as education and 
health care. He will stick with 
that successful formula, fre
quently reminding Americans 
they are living through the long
est economic expansion in 
U.S. history. Look for more 
foreign travel as well, a tradi
tional avenue of success for 
American presidents.
After the impeachment votes Fri
day, Clinton pledged to rededicate 
ourselves to the work of serving our 
nation and building our future. 
There is a good chance Clinton 
and Congress could come together 
on two or three big issues such as 
Social Security, a big defense 
buildup, and perhaps a tax cut, 
said Reed, former director of the 
Christian Coalition.
I tend not to buy into the con
ventional wisdom that this has 
so soured relations between the 
White House and Capitol Hill that 
were not going to see things get 
done, Reed said.
Strother said Clinton will feel 
enormous pressure to succeed in
the last two years, but at the 
same time he wont want to 
make the Republican Congress 
look good.
Dont forget, Bill Clinton is a 
fantastic politician, Strother 
said. He will position these is
sues in a way that to oppose him 
is to oppose the American people.
Even when the impeachment 
battle was under way, Clinton 
demonstrated he could control the 
agenda. His mantra last year to 
save Social Security short-cir
cuited Republican hopes for a big 
tax cut.
Clinton followed that up this 
year with a plan to fix Social 
Security with budget surpluses. 
Added to that were poll-tested 
initiatives to reform managedcare health insurance programs, 
to build more schools, hire more 
teachers, and make schools and 
teachers accountable to parents.
I think the president is in a 
very strong position, White 
House domestic policy adviser 
Bruce Reed said. He has a strong 
centrist agenda and overwhelm
ing public support.
Congress needs to put the past 
year behind it and listen to the 
pleas of the American people to 
stop playing politics and start 
getting things done, Reed said. 
I think they will be eager to do 
that. Were always open to death
bed conversions. We wont hold 
this against them, that theyve 
disagreed with us in the pastif 
they come around.

50 YEARS AGO, February 16, 
1949  Installation of the Carn
egie synchro-cyclotron project 
reached completion after several 
years of construction work.
A cyclotron is a device used to 
give high speed to charged 
particles by magnetic and 
electric fields.
The planned cyclotron had 
40,000 times more strength than 
the earths gravitational field.
The cyclotron, originally to be 
built on campus, was relocated to 
a site in Saxonburg 35 miles north 
of Pittsburgh after it became ob
vious. that university grounds 
would not provide the necessary 
space for the project.
25 YEARS AGO, February 12, 
1974CMU radio station WRCT 
announced its intent to convert 
broadcast from AM to FM. The
decision, which involved an 
investment of $5,000 for equip
ment and installation, came 
as part of a greater effort to 
extend listenership.
With the shift to FM, 
the stations broadcasting 
range increased from three to 
five miles, making WRCT pro
grams accessible to more 
off-campus students.
In celebration of the birth of 
WRCT-FM, the staff put together 
a one-day all-music broadcast 
with songs from the 35 most out
standing groups from the decade.
10 YEARS AGO, February 14, 
1989  Following a protest by 
60 CFA students and nearly a 
week of daily negotiations 
between students and adminis
tration, an agreement could 
not be reached on the proposed
venue of the biennial CFA 
Beaux Arts Ball.
In a statement issued one 
month before the Balls proposed 
date, Dean of Student Affairs 
Brad Walter said he would not 
allow the event to be held at its 
traditional venue, the College of 
Fine Arts building, unless stu
dents could guarantee that alco
hol would not be served 
at the party.
Student Senate spoke out 
against Walters decision, argu
ing that it indicated a lack of 
faith and trust in the character of 
CFA students.
5 YEARS AGO, February 14, 
1994  Student Government 
President David Wolpert vetoed 
a resolution that would allow 
Faculty Senate to implement plus 
and minus grading to under
graduate students that year.
The resolution, if passed, would 
have allowed grades from Ato D+ to be recorded on 
student transcripts.
By rejecting the resolution, 
Wolpert believed that he was 
representing the belief that the 
plus/minus grading systems 
would result in lower GPAs 
and higher stress levels 
among students.
1 YEAR AGO, February 16, 
1998  The Board of Trustees 
approved the addition of a $20 
million wing to Building D.
The goal of the project was to 
add two stories to Building D and 
a Mobile Robotics Center to the 
existing structure.

Twenty-Three CMU Grads Cant All Be Wrong
There just seems to be something that 
draws CMU grads to FactSet.
Maybe it's the fact that the company is still small enough for an 
individual to make a difference.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 February 19995
Students disapprove of 
latest tuition increases
TUITION, from page 1
We used $32 million from the endow
ment with a total operating budget of 
$417 million. When we look at our en
dowment compared to universities in 
our peer group, we have a much 
lower amount, and we draw on it at a 
higher rate.
Cohon said that the rest of the operat
ing budget comes from research income 
and tuition. The general inflation rate 
is less than two percent. However, the 
actual university inflation rate is higher 
due to research and overall capital costs. 
We would also like to continue to offer 
competitive salaries to our personnel. 
The higher costs are also going towards 
the new buildings that include the 
Purnell Center for the Arts and the ad
ditions to the School of Computer Sci
ence. We would like to have additional 
money available for investments on pro
grams for all academic departments. 
Many students do not agree with the 
tuition increase. I think that its ridicu
lous, said Lou Chomas, a first-year phys
ics major. There is no reason to do this. 
The university brings films [Wonder 
Boys] to campus and inconveniences the 
students. They need to look at adminis
trative overhead and need to cut back on 
stuff. Were being overcharged for ev
erything except for education. I also 
doubt that, since the overall costs have
gone up by four percent, my financial aid 
is going to go up by four percent.
We are really not seeing any increase 
in services and I feel the quality in ser
vices has actually gone down, said Fred 
Hopke, a sophomore mechanical engi
neering major. [Im] not sure what ex
actly were paying for.
Readers of the electronic bboard 
cmu.misc.market learned about the 
tuition increase and voiced 
their discontent.
I think its ridiculous, said junior 
communication design major Jevaun 
Howell. I think its kind of interesting 
that students first saw it on 
cmu.misc.market. The University should 
make more of an effort to publicize it. 
However, some students see why the 
tuition is going up. I understand why, 
because we are a relatively young univer
sity, said Jeff Samat, a first-year com
puter science major. However, it makes it 
harder for people to afford to come here. 
Its not so much of an increase, I 
guess, said Dan Robinson, a junior elec
trical and computer engineering major. 
But its more of an issue of the lack of 
respect the administration has for the 
students. They treat this more like a 
business than a school.
Last year the tuition increased 4.9% 
from $20,275 to $21,275. Previous years 
saw 4.5%, 4.3%, and 3.9% increases.
Corrections/Clarifications...
In last weeks Carnegie Almanac, the entry for February 7, 1994 stated 
that security guards were allowed to physically detain suspects. This should 
have read that guards were not allowed to detain subjects.
The Tartan corrects all known errors of fact. If you know of an error, 
contact Edito7'-in-Chief Kevin Babbitt at x8-2111 or tartan@andrew.cmu.edu.
Construction moves along
CONSTRUCTION, from page 1
be able to seat over 400 people. The 
theater, designed by Leonard Auerbach 
and Associates, is unique because of its 
integration into the building. So many 
of us have spent time in theaters that 
were not ideal, said Frisch. It was 
easy for us to sit down and design this.
One of the unique aspects of this 
theater is the recently installed twostory doors that will allow for easy 
access into the shop,  said Kate 
Weisbrod, a junior civil engineering 
major and intern on the Purnell project.
These expensive doors had to be 24 
feet high and soundproof, said Frisch.
The doors will allow theater productions 
to construct scenery in the adjoining shop 
and easily bring it into the area behind 
the stage. Frisch described the integra
tion of the theater by pointing out that 
the loading dock is attached to the 
shop that in turn is joined to the theater 
via the new doors.
The construction of the theater is mov
ing rapidly, with work on the seating 
area nearing completion, and the atten
tion to detail is becoming apparent. The 
boxes in the new theater are designed to 
reflect the boxes in Kresge, said Frisch 
of the small boxes that surround the 
theater on the second floor.
The ceiling was painted this dark 
blue to help draw the audience into 
the action on the stage, said Weisbrod 
as she pointed out the recently painted 
theater ceiling.
The theater will actually be quite 
elegant. The brick wall is actually made 
up of several different colors, said 
Frisch of the newly built theater wall. 
He also pointed out that the theater 
would most likely make extensive use 
of mahogany and cherry paneling. 
Frisch emphasized, that, even though 
the theater was a large space, it was 
being designed to provide a certain 
feeling of intimacy for the audience.

The Purnell Center theater workshop, attached to a loading dock as well as the theater, will be used to produce sets.

New Business From Com
mittee:
S99-003: Spirit has requested 
a special allocation to support 
events for Black History Month. 
These include a performance of 
University of Pittsburghs Kuntu 
Theatre, and a public appearance 
on Nikki Giovanni, a well-known 
black author. The total cost for 
the events is $10,430. Spirit has 
raised $3,650 from various 
sources. AB Political Speakers is 
contributing an additional $4,000 
for the events. Spirit has re
quested $2,500 from Senate for 
these events, to cover speaker 
fees. The Funding and Recogni
tion Committee has recom
mended an allocation of $1,000, 
due to the large amount of Stu
dent Government funds already 
put forward by AB. Allocation of 
$1,000 approved by voice vote.
S99-004: Special Allocation to 
Asian Students Association (ASA). 
ASAhas requested money for booth 
for this Spring Carnival. ASA was 
reduced to non-funded status last 
semester by Senate due to an alcohol-related incident, and conse
quently they do not have funds for 
building booth. The Funding and 
Recognition Committee is recom
mending an allocation of $250, be
cause this is the amount that ASA 
was able to raise for booth last 
year, and will likely be able to raise 
again this year. This is in keeping 
with the policy for booth funding 
set forward by the JFC. 
Allocation of $250 approved 
by voice vote.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University15 February 1999Benefactor served as role model
When Paul Mellon died last Mon
day, CMU and the nation lost a 
friend and benefactor. In a world 
where people often pursue money 
solely as an end in itself, Mellon 
stood out in his commitment to 
Sharing his great wealth.
If not for his efforts, CMU wouldnt 
existhad the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology (CIT) not combined 
with the Mellon Institute, there 
would be no Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. When the institute wanted 
to combine with a local university 
in the 1960s, the University ofPittsburgh, which already had ties with 
the institute, seemed to be the ob
vious choice. But Paul Mellon felt 
that unification with CIT and its 
stronger scientific reputation would 
be a better decision, and he pushed 
for this to happen.
During his lifetime, Mellon played 
an essential role in shaping CMU, 
giving generously to the Univer
sity. MeUonsfamilyfoundationand 
bther organizations associated with 
him donated $60 million to the 
University during the merger, dou
bling its endowment, and $20 mil
lion more over the years. Mellon 
himself served as the honorary 
bhair of one of CMUs capital cam
paigns. Even his death failed to 
bnd his legacy of contribution to the 
University, as CMU will get $20 
million of his estate.
Mellons largesse was not con
fined to CMU. He is perhaps best 
known for his work for the Na
tional Gallery of Art in Washing
ton, D.C. His father founded the
gallery in 1937, but it was Paul 
Mellon who, after his fathers death, 
donated 913 paintings to the gal
lery over the years. He also finan
cially backed a second building 
when the collection outgrew its 
space and served for many years as 
the gallerys president and chair
man of its board of trustees.
The same spirit that led him to be 
so active in the growth of the Na
tional Gallery showed itself in all 
areas of his life. For him, an appre
ciation of the arts and humanities 
was necessaiyfor balance, andbenefiting others was much more 
worthwhile than simply putting 
effort into expanding his already 
considerable wealth. His donations 
to CMU reflected his focus on these 
fields. He specified that much of 
the money he gave was to go to 
H&SS and CFA. This commitment 
to these disciplines was especially 
welcome at a school whose techni
cal departments sometimes over
shadow its liberal arts programs.
The money that Mellon dispersed 
so generously came from his banker 
fathers shrewd financing of indus
trialists in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries. Todays heirs to the 
industrialists  those who owe 
their fortunes to high-tech enter
prises  might do well to keep in 
mind Mellons extraordinary gifts.
Mellon leaves behind a substan
tial legacy of philanthropy and com
mitment to the arts. It can only be 
hoped that his memory will inspire 
the University and the community 
to emulate his generous spirit.Online system would enhance feedback
Students who want to complain 
to their professors are often 
afraid to do so. Faculty Course 
Evaluations (FCEs), which stu
dents fill out at the end of 
each semester, provide a useful 
means of feedback once a course 
is completed, but they do not al
low professors to change prob
lems in the course during the se
mester. Early Course Evaluations 
(ECEs), adopted by some 
departments,are a step in the 
right direction, but they still dont 
offer students the opportunity to 
submit feedback at an arbitrary 
time during the semester. Fur
thermore, unlike FCEs, there are 
no standard procedures for dis
tributing ECEs  professors in 
some departments remain in the 
room while ECEs are adminis
tered, which affects the level of 
student anonymity. A Universitywide online feedback system 
would allow students to submit 
their comments to professors at 
any time while still hiding their 
identity.
: Because students fill out ECEs 
and FCEs during class time, pro
fessors who are anxious to begin 
teaching often cut short the time 
taken to do so, preventing 
students from recalling all t1' 
suggestions they want to include. 
While some alternative means 
of providing feedback, such as vis
iting professors during their of
fice hours, currently exist, stu
dents often feel intimidated to 
explore them, and their com
plaints go unspoken.
Taking into consideration the 
problems that current evaluation 
systems present, the Social and 
Decision Sciences Department set 
up an online system for submitting 
information to faculty. The evalua
tion allows students to send input 
at any time and guarantees their 
anonymity. The form is separated 
into a quick comment form and a 
detailed comment section, and be
cause it is online, students can take 
their time filling them out. In addi
tion, the detailed comment form 
builds on the original FCEs and 
asks questions that are in greater 
depth and more pertinent to the 
professors teaching methods.
Concerns associated with online 
systems, such as the potential for 
abuse, are easily addressed. For 
example, students could be re
quired to log in with the under
standing that their identities will 
be kept on record with only the 
intention of tracking down abus
ers  this information would not 
be relayed to professors. Further
more, if students use the system 
responsibly, the number of prob
lems that need to be tracked down 
would be kept to a minimum, and 
professors would be more inclined 
to take feedback received through 
the system seriously.
The University should create a 
basic online system for submit
ting feedback to professors as a 
supplement to current evaluation 
systems. This would help to alle
viate problems that exist within 
our current system, and improve 
student satisfaction with courses.

and Intel [Microsoft limits own life with 
blunders, Feb. 8]. However, as much 
as I respect Linux as an operating sys
tem for servers, the most obvious alter
native for general computing is the 
Macintosh. It has all the features of
Windows without all the hassle, and 
with the exciting new technologies on 
the road ahead, the future has never 
been brighter.
The PowerPC processor is now racing 
ahead of the Pentium line, with dra
matically faster processors on the way 
(and no processor ID to play Big Brother). 
FireWire, the new high-speed connec

thing from camcorders to the latest 
PowerMacs. And with Mac OS X (based 
on work done at CMU) on the horizon, 
we will soon have the stability and power 
of UNIX with the classic Mac ease-ofuse and compatibility.
Linux is a great work of operating 
system design, but it is far from ready to 
serve the majority of computer 
users. And the chokehold that Micro
soft and Intel have on the computer 
industry remains strong. WitnessCarnegie Mellons recent contract with 
Microsoft, which is slowly completing 
its dominance of all software categories. 
It is going to take a lot more than a 
nifty operating system like Linux to

Sex Week sends mixed messages
Rob Jefferson
I Starting a few weeks ago, I1 
noticed the yellow signs plas
tered all over the campus. 
Seeing the name Sex Week 
on them made me wonder if 
this was just some bizarre 
joke perpetuated by a ran
dom prankster. I thus ignored 
them, or at least attempted 
to do so.
Last week, however, I be
gan seeing the posters with 
the events for Sex Week ev
erywhere. In the upper righthand comer was something 
resembling the old CMU 
tilted-square logo, but in
stead of a tilted square there 
was a tilted condom. Need
less to say, this greatly dis
turbed me, not only because 
Sex Week was a school-sup
ported event, but also be
cause people used the famil
iar image of the school logo to 
convey their idea.
Perhaps the intended goals 
of the Sex Week Committee 
are noble  promoting sex 
as a life-affirming and fun 
activity when done in a re
sponsible manner  but the 
implementation of their mes
sage suggests otherwise. The 
impression I received from the 
posters was a combination of 
messages: sex and responsi
bility, with sex winning out 
by a country mile.
Whether the sponsoring or
ganizations realize it or not, 
trying to mix the two concepts 
together is a mistake in 
advertising. If you compare 
the strength of both ideas, 
theres no contest. Sex is a con
cept of which the merest men
tion causes the greater 
amount of association. Just the 
word seems to evoke contro
versy from all sides, from 
those who wish to see sex sup
pressed to those who see noth
ing as sacred.
Responsibility is a concept 
that few people would want to 
argue with; after all, it would 
be unusual to argue that 
people should not take respon
sibility for their own actions. 
But its much weaker in visual 
imagery. Being an abstract 
concept, responsibility requires 
stronger images to convey 
than sex, which has blatant 
concrete representations. This 
seems to be why commercials 
about the dangers of sex have
to be blatant and 
dramatic, whereas 
sex has an effect 
even when seem
ingly innocuous in
nuendos are men
tioned. Wherever 
libido leads, respon
sibility falls behind.
Thus, in advertis
ing Sex Week, the 
committee should 
have realized what 
message it was con
veying. While in 
theory, they were 
addressing both sex and its 
consequences, the second 
component was in the shadow 
of the first. The effect the 
committee was apparently at
tempting to achieve had 
been undermined.
Another point of contention 
I have is the tacit assmptions 
that the idea of Sex Week 
makes. Perhaps I am the only 
one to notice this, but present 
in the Sex Week concept is 
the assertion, however un
stated, that everyone in this 
school is having sex, or should 
be. Presentations about sex 
and its consequences have 
negligible value to those per
sons in the student popula
tion who have no reasonable
expectation of getting a date.
I am inclined to believe that 
Sex Week is yet another wa^ 
for groups to place a shiny 
veneer upon the miserable 
social structure of the school. 
It proclaims to the world: 
Were a bunch of well-ad
justed, sexually active 
people! This place doesnt 
have socially pathetic stu 
dents! Really!
This is all a conspiracy^ 
foisted upon us by the 10 per
cent of the school that is hav: 
ing 90 percent or more of th 
sex, to make us appear com: 
paratively normal to the resi 
of the world. Even the at
tempt to have an event to

City snow removal leaves student cold;
__________________James Raskob
Once again, Pittsburgh has demon
strated that normal weather need not 
apply. After several days of wonderful 
warm weather, jackets are appearing. 
Little drops of crystallized H20 are fall
ing down from above, and starting to 
form alliances and make big fluffy piles, 
suitable for making snowballs and break
ing ankles. Once again, the fearless Pitts
burgh snow removal crews are doing 
very little. Apparently, Pittsburghers 
are under the impression that salt is a 
controlled substance, or perhaps they 
believe there is a local law that crews 
can only work if there is at least four feet 
of snow on the ground.
It is fairly easy to think back to the 
beginning of the semester, when inchthick sheets of ice coated many paths
and sidewalks. Snow drifted over them, 
providing perfect conditions for acci
dents. Such conditions are hardly un
known in northern cities  Boston, for 
example  but there, it does not last 
long. Brave, determined crews bring out 
an arsenal of sand trucks, plows, shov
els, picks, and tons of that secret weapon: 
salt. Ice is smashed up, snow tossed off 
roads and sidewalks, and soon condi
tions are merely a little slick, much like 
a bad rainstorm  caution is required, 
but not much more. Here, however, ice 
remained for days. Stairways became 
slides, and more than one person (in
cluding myself) fell repeatedly. Where 
did we hide that salt again? Maybe we 
need to send out a search party.
Campus and Pittsburgh in general 
were in much the same shape. More 
than one driver found that there are fish 
in Pittsburgh, or at least fishtails. Offcampus students found that their build
ing managers didnt have any salt ei
ther. Plows are an endangered species^ 
Salt trucks? What are they?
After two days walking over an ice 
sheet every time I wanted to get to my 
campus apartment, I finally saw some? 
one putting out salt. Pittsburgh and the 
campus should know where they put 
their own supplies, but apparently 
they dont.
Granted, winter weather can be hard; 
to deal with. Storms can do a lot of 
damage, and it can be hard to clean u$ 
after them. All the more reason to have 
people and equipment to deal with them.' 
It is not as if this is the first storm in 
Pittsburgh history, or even the worst.' 
While almost no snow fell last year, this 
has not always been the case. In fact, the 
break should have been a chance to 
stock up  since equipment wasnt be^ 
ing used, the budget should have been 
used to stock up on expendables ant$ 
maintain and upgrade vehicles. Was it

Gun control inspires hopes for rebellion, kung fu
^3rYishan Wong
Perhaps youve heard of the 
recent legal wranglings to have 
un manufacturers held liable for 
^un-related killings. Admittedly, 
the manufacturers arent selling 
uns to the murderers them
selves, but the case is that they 
ell a lot of guns, increasing the 
{lumber in circulation, thereby 
Increasing the likelihood that 
those who want to steal a gun can 
get one, and, presumably, use it 
to kill somebody.
It is the well-known rhetoric of 
the NRA and many Republicans 
to say that guns dont kill 
people, people kill people. Of 
course, the rest of us understand 
fhat people who kill people use 
guns to kill more people faster 
knd from farther away. We used 
to be able to point to the military 
to prove our point, but they dont 
use guns anymore  they use 
cruise missiles.
I Regardless, I am pleased by 
fhis anti-gun sentiment. I am very
much for gun control. I am for 
the blanket outlawing of any 
and all types of guns. I am for 
jack-booted thugs breaking into 
vour home, searching it for fire
arms, and confiscating them, 
possibly breaking valuable heir
looms in your china hutch 
while doing so. And no, I dont 
care what our Constitution 
says about it.
Why? Most people would 
say that it is because Im a 
fascist megalomaniac bent 
on the subjugation of my so
cial inferiors. That may be so, 
but its not like Im about to 
let my enemies quote me 
saying that. In reality, I 
like gun control for the fol
lowing reasons:
First, I like martial arts. 
Theyre cool. Instead of sit
ting around praying all day 
like their Western counterparts, 
Shao-lin monks in China spent 
nearly 1,000 years developing 
and codifying personal combat 
fighting styles. It got pretty 
scary, the things they learned 
to do. Im sure youve watched 
enough movies to know.
If firearms, were outlawed, Street fights here in America 
martial arts might flower once are pretty lame, with drive-by 
again. In ancient Okinawa, when shootings and amateurish 
the foreign samurai forces took knifings. Perhaps if guns were 
over and outlawed weapons, the not so readily available, a gangnatives learned kara-te (Way land assassination might involve 
of Empty-Handed Fighting) and sinister black-clad ninjas in a
stealthy midnight opera
tion. Knives and other 
bladed weapons would 
become an entire art of 
their own. People com
plain about violent crimes 
today. They woiili^ com
plain less if criminal! 
ply had more style.
The second reason I like 
gun control is that people 
simply wouldnt stand for' 
it. All the right-wingers 
(and if we had the jackbooted thugs, a good num
ber of left-wingers too) 
Cory Shopper/Tartan Art Staff would go ballistic and run 
how to fight with their farming into the forests to join militias.
implements. Nunchaku were 
originally used to thresh wheat. 
The gun was one of those West
ern inventions that spoiled a lot
There is a good chance that the 
resurgence of martial arts might 
coincide with the militia move
ment. As it was in the early days
of good stuff  1,000 years of of the Manchu dynasty, rebels 
killing research made obsolete, would gather in the Shao-lin 
just like that. temples and train to overthrow
the government. If the crazy right
wingers in this country went and 
learned something about being at 
peace with oneself and the world, 
maybe they would be more accept
ing and less angry, and quit shout
ing about how everything everyone 
else does is immoral and wrong. 
And maybe high government offi
cials could have personal affairs 
without causing national incidents.
Right now the government is too 
careful to keep everyone happy, and 
it certainly isnt going to change 
with liberals like Gore in office. We 
need fascist and extremist policies 
to make everyone mad, and blanket 
gun control would be a good start. 
With that, the population will be 
incensed, and it will finally spark 
the revolution that everyone wants. 
We Americans like having 
revolutions; it makes us feel heroic 
and rebellious. And so, its the re
sponsibility of a democratic govern
ment to serve the will of the people 
and vilify itself so that we can over
throw it.
Yishan Wong thinks that people 
who buy and use extremely expen
sive pens are stupid.
Genetic engineering opens new evolutionary possibilities
Guido Zarrella
: How many people are there who 
have ever had stitches or a cast, or 
used crutches to walk on a injured leg?
How many people do you know who 
arent lucky enough to have eyesight 
.good enough that they dont need glasses?
And we all know people who have had 
their lives saved or dramatically im
proved by modem medicine.
' Im all for using science to save lives,
; and Im happy that these things are 
done. I have no interest in dying young, 
or seeing anyone else die, for that mat
ter. An unfortunate side effect of our 
' technology, however, is that humans no 
longer need to evolve.
! Along, longtime ago, animals were all 
bn the same playing field. To survive,
: ^ou either had to be good at hiding or be 
. able to kill your enemies. A creature 
with bad eyesight or easily breakable 
bones would be at a great disadvantage 
i in this situation, and the chances were 
very good that they would be killed be
fore they were ever given the chance to 
Reproduce and pass their poor eyesight/
^veak bone genes on to their offspring.
Pittsburgh needs more salt
Animals who developed diabetes or 
asthma would be in the same position.
This all changed when some creatures 
began to develop intelligence. This was a 
new type of advantage, and naturally, it 
changed the requirements of survival. 
Scientists have pointed to the fossil records 
of several million years ago, when there 
was a great variety of manlike species. A 
number of these species have been found 
with holes and fractures in their skulls. 
And so it was humans, not coincidentally 
also the tool experts, that were able to kill 
off the competition and survive.
Today, human intelligence has pro
gressed to the level where we have been 
able to protect ourselves almost completely 
from other species or even from the natu
ral selection that might occur from the 
normal weeding out of people with genetic 
defects. The fact that a modern woman 
can live for another 50 years after meno
pause indicates that humans live far 
longer than our evolution ever prepared 
us for.
So now that the survival of most 
people is virtually a given, what is going 
to force humans to continue to evolve? 
Nothing. Our gene pool will gradually 
decrease in quality over the years, but 
our increases in technology will make 
up for it.
But isnt it sad to think that this is the 
end of the line for human evolution? Hu
mans are doomed to stay as we are, until 
the day when we all destroy ourselves 
with nuclear weapons, or until the dol
phins unveil the secret technology theyve 
been developing and make slaves of the 
entire human race (because dolphins are 
far more intelligent than most people 
give them credit for).
Dont despair! The latest advance in 
human intelligence has provided us with 
a wonderful little tool for our own selfimprovement. Its not plastic surgery or 
bionic implants or liposuction  its ge
netic engineering.
If this technology can eventually reach 
the level that many people expect it to, it 
would easily put an end to our imprison
ment in the evolutionary dead-end form 
of the human body. We can already cre
ate genetically enhanced plants or ani
mals, like the gigantic cucumbers used 
by Vlasic to make the super-pickle, which 
is large enough that one slice will cover 
an entire hamburger. Scientists are also 
having success with transplanting rat 
genes into other creatures to produce 
milk which is drinkable by humans with 
lactose intolerance.
Some people think that these types of 
changes are terrible, fearing the day when
you can go to the gene doctor and order a 
baby with blond hair, blue eyes, an IQ of 175, 
and perfect teeth. I admit, if everyone were 
the same and traditionally perfect, hu
mans wouldnt be any better off than we are 
now. But why stop there?
Why wouldnt we be allowed to order up a 
few more unique features for our kids? Did 
you know that birds can leave half of their 
brain awake while they sleep? That would be 
incredibly useful during lecture. Ive always 
wanted a prehensile tail, for swinging through 
the trees. And I dont see why we couldnt 
develop special kinds of sensors for our eye
balls to detect infrared light, for night vision. 
The possibilities are endless! Be it retract
able claws, pointy horns, or an extra thumb 
in place of the pinky finger, it would make 
humans a lot more interesting.
Society would be forced to change with it. 
For example, there couldnt be any black or 
white when people started being born with 
designer-colored skin and intricate patterns 
of green and red genetically tattooed on their 
bodies. People need to learn that its not a 
bad thing to be different. Who needs a stan
dardized form of beauty? Not me! Bring on 
the genetic engineers.
Guido Zarrella plans to be first in line 
when they start offering human transplants 
of the sonar gene from bats.
SNOW, from page 6
Pittsburghs Channel 11 news 
gleefully reported that Pitts
burgh was running out of salt. 
Did this storm spring out of 
nowhere like New Englands 
infamous Blizzard of78? Did 
it come in the late spring after 
a long hard winter like the Bos
ton April Fools Day blizzard 
of 97? Both those storms 
dropped feet of snow on a city 
that didnt know it was coming, 
had seen too much snow al
ready and was exhausted. But 
the crews dug in and did their 
Ipest. More salt was dug out, 
more plows thrown in. In 97, 
three feet of snow fell, but the
streets were cleared by April 3  
two days to dig out from under 
three feet.
Granted, Pittsburgh is not Bos
ton. But both the storms men
tioned above were extreme for 
Boston, and the city cleared 
things up rapidly. Now why cant 
Pittsburgh do the same? Find that 
salt  we may need it again.
James David Rene Raskob is a 
sophomore in mechanical engi
neeringfromNewEngland, where 
they understand how to deal 
with fluffy water. He has dealt 
with plenty of snow already, and 
would like to see a little less of it in 
the future.
Sex conspiracy makes us more normal
SEX, from page 6
teach people how to find a date 
was but a mere decoy. Teaching 
people about dating is, to steal a 
phrase from Frank Zappa, like 
dancing about architecture. No 
matter what you know about dat
ing or sex, it is the application 
that matters in the end.
However, all of this begs the 
question: What would be the goal 
of this conspiracy? Why would so 
much time and money get spent 
to provide an illusion that sexual 
activity is going on? The reason, 
of course, is that by making the 
student body seem more nor
mal to the eyes of the world, the 
school can attract more normal
students, instead of social mis
fits. In turn, the school becomes 
a more attractive place for the 
intelligent but unadventurous. 
The end result would be a school 
of people just like the conspira
tors: able to get good grades, 
but incapable of moving out
side the status quo.
The cynical side of me con
nects this issue to the sex ver
sus responsibility dilemma. By 
playing upon the stronger con
notations of sex, the advertis
ing (simple as it may be) draws 
hordes of students to these 
events. The more people who 
come to the meetings, the bet
ter the event looks in the eyes
of the organizations with vested 
interests, providing the impetus to 
repeat the scenario. The bigger the 
events become, the more wellknown the event and school be
come. Finally, the school rests in 
that conspiratorially designed cycle 
of normality.
Fellow students of Carnegie 
Mellon,. I implore you: Resist the 
message of Sex Week! Make it so
cially acceptable to be lonely and 
bitter! Together, we can preserve 
the insanity and defend the school 
against its cultural demise.
Rob Jefferson, despite being the 
former lead singer of a has-been 
art-rock band, cannot get a date.

able to hang on to win the game

Perhaps a little tired after the

The poor play exhibited 
against Grove City did not sit 
well with the team, who ex
pected a much better 
performace against such poor 
competition.
It was frustrating not to win 
against those weaker teams, 
Oba said. That was a really 
tough loss to Grove City.
The team will look to rebound 
from the disappointing loss 
against the University of Pitts

teams record stands at 3-1 in 
tri-matches and 4-7 overall.
CMU drops to 
last in UAAs
BASKETBALL, from page 10
Despite senior guard Tommy 
Praesels 16 points, first-year 
guard Ralph Deabrunzzos 11, 
and 10 more from junior forward 
Brad McNutt, the Tartans could 
not keep up with Kenyons touch. 
The Lords ruled the second half, 
tallying 50 points in all, and 
handed Carnegie Mellon its 
fourth straight loss: 78-68.
The going didnt get any easier 
for the Tartans as they departed 
for a two-game Midwestern road 
swing last Friday that would see 
games versus UAA opponents 
Washington University and the 
University of Chicago.
Last Fridays game against the 
UAA frontrunner Washington 
Universtiy Bears was never in 
much doubt. The Bears 
featured a much bigger, 
more mature team, and 
have been the UAAs 
winningest team since 
the conference began a 
decade ago.
Unlike the Kenyon 
game, the Wash. U. con
test was not a shootout 
from the opening tipoff. The Bears held 
Carnegie Mellon to six 
of 28 field goals in the 
first half, one of four 
from three-point land.
One of the only reasons 
the game didnt get too 
ugly in the first 20 min
utes is CMUs 9-11 free 
throw shooting. Wash.
U. was just bigger and 
better, though, sinking 
five three-pointers and 
going into the locker 
room with a 36-22 halftime lead.
McNutt was able to 
score in double digits 
again, leading the team 
with 17 points on Fri
day, followed by firstyear guard Jim Abels
11 and first-year guard
Ryan Willumsons nine. The 
strong individual performances 
could not stop the onslaught of 
Bear offense, however, and for 
the second straight game, the 
Tartans gave up 50 or more points 
in the second half. Washington 
got a big boost from Tartan fouls, 
shooting 22-27 from the charity 
stripe. In the end, the Tartans 
fell to their fifth straight loss 89- 
61, dropping their record to 5-16 
on the year.
The team plays at UAA foe Uni
versity of Rochester on Sunday, 
February 21 and face Bethany in 
their final home contest on Feb
ruary 24 before traveling to 
Emory University on February 
27 for the final game 
of the year.

The official crew season has been 
over for months, but for the CMU 
rowers, winter is anything but an off racing season.

the entire rowing community. Indoor 
regattas tend to motivate rowers, who 
are already highly competitive, to 
train even harder for the upcoming

from practicing and competing in local indoor competitions.
season. In below-freezing tempera
tures, the members of the crew team 
lurch out of residence halls at 5:45 am 
with eyes not yet open on their way to 
practice. It is not, however, down to 
the boathouse that the proud and dedi
cated members are headed, but over to 
the Skibo Gym. They are building up 
strength and stamina for when they 
can return to those 5 am practices on 
the water when the weather gets 
warmer, but they are also preparing 
for the Indoor Rowing Championships, 
a test of a rowers fitness during the 
winter training season.
Contrary to popular belief, indoor 
rowing championships are not held in 
a pool. Instead, these challenges are 
inside a gym on rowing machines, or 
ergometers (ergs). This past Satur
day, the CMU crew team was repre
sented by 15 members who competed 
in the Pittsburgh Rowing Champion
ships at Winston-Thurston School. 
Each participant rowed a single 2Kfor 
their part of the competition, with the 
times staying close, ranging from six 
to 10 minutes.
Overall, the erg race was beneficial 
to everyone who participated, said 
Martin Richards, a senior business 
administration major. Regardless of 
whether you medal or not, its a great 
opportunity to gauge your performance
Richards was among five varsity men 
and three novice men to compete, three 
of whom displayed outstanding times, 
and all finished within five seconds of 
each other. David Clumpner, a sopho
more business administration major 
prepared for the race by losing three 
pounds in 30 minutes to make the 
lightweight category. For him, the com
petition was a warm-up for the na
tional championships next week in 
Boston. He went away with second 
place and a personal best time by three 
seconds. It seemed like everyone 
pulled a personal best, he said. For 
me, it was a good checkpoint to see 
where I am in training for the 
world championships next week 
in Boston.
Graduate student Paul Riley took 
eighth place in the open mens cat
egory. I pulled my limit at the end of 
the race, since I was ready to drop 
dead by the end of it, he said.
For the novice rowers competing in 
their first Indoor Rowing Champion
ships, hopes are high that they can 
continue to perform at the same inten
sity level. I was really proud of how 
well the team performed this year. 
This was by far the most exciting and 
memorable erg race during my four 
years here, said Joanne Wei, a senior 
business admininistration major.

The CMU womens basketball team 
went into the last game of their fourgame homestand on Sunday, February 
7 against Brandeis University. The team 
was looking to get back on track after a 
41-point loss to New York University.
Losers of two straight and four out of 
six UAA games during a late-season 
stretch, the Tartans desperately needed 
a victory to stay afloat in the UAA stand
ings. Though hopelessly behind unde
feated leader Washington University, 
the Tartans were fighting to stay in the 
middle of the pack and not drift into the 
cellar. It was a close game, but the team 
responded to the challenge and pulled 
away late, winning the game 62-53, to 
end their recent skid.
With a win to cover up the memory of 
the NYU game, the Tartans went back 
on the road for a weekend trip to Wash
ington University of St. Louis and the 
University of Chicago, continuing the 
crucial stretch of in-conference games.
The first stop of the trip was at Wash. 
U. last Friday, February 12. The Tar
tans faced a tough match against the 
undefeated UAA leaders, but came out 
ready to play. CMU hung tough against 
the pressing Wash. U. defense and kept 
the game fairly close through most of the 
first half. In the end, the Tartans did 
themselves in with poor shooting from 
the floor. CMU made just nine of 24
shots in the first 
half while Wash. U. 
hit 14 of 29, in
cluding three of 
four from threepoint range.
Trailing 37-23 at 
the half, CMU 
picked up the pace 
in an effort to get 
back in the game. 
The second half saw 
the Tartans play 
with much more in
tensity as they re
alized that yet an
other league game 
was slipping away 
from them. Though 
not shooting much 
better than in the 
first half, the Tar
tans generated 
more scoring 
chances, especially 
from the foul line. 
CMU hit nine of 11 
free throws in the 
second half com
pared to just three 
of four in the first 
half. The added 
chances came from 
more hustle by the 
Tartans, who did a

much better job driving to the hoop and 
drawing fouls. The Tartans also picked 
up their rebounding to keep 
the game from getting 
hopelessly out of reach.
Unfortunately for the 
Tartans, their added offen
sive output came just when 
Washington went on an in
credible streak of shooting. 
Hitting 19 of 34 shots in 
the second half, Wash. U. 
brought its total shooting 
percentage to an unbeliev
able 56 percent. For most 
of the half, it seemed as 
though Washington was in
capable of missing a shot, 
and even when they did, 
the Tartans were fre
quently unable to grab the 
rebound and head back the 
other way.
As productive as the Tar
tans offense was, they just 
couldnt stop the high-powered Washington team, 
who scored 47 points in the 
second half alone.t Three 
Washington players scored 
in double figures, while 
sophomore guard Lauren 
Petruzzi was the only Tar
tan to do so, scoring 18.
Offense wasnt the only area in which 
Wash. U. excelled, though. Besides the 
gap in shooting percentage, the main 
difference in the game was Washingtons 
attacking defense. As shown in the game 
against NYU and in the seasons previ
ous meeting with Washington, the Tar
tan offense proved vulnerable to an 
aggressive, pressing defense, turningthe 
ball over 25 times, 13 on Washington 
steals. The Tartans couldnt adjust to 
the Bears quickness, finding passing 
lanes continually closed by the sudden 
appearance of a defender. In contrast, 
Washington practically put on a ball 
control clinic, allowing only three CMU 
steals and 13 total turnovers for the 
game. The continually moving offense 
routinely led to open passes, allowing 
Washington to move the ball around the 
offensive end seemingly at will.
Washingtons overall play was simply 
too much for the Tartans, who never got 
back into the game arter falling behind 
in the first half. Washi/igton pulled away 
in the second half, despite the best ef
forts of the Tartans. The final score was 
84-55 Washington as the Bears pre
served thier undefeated record.
The Tartans record moved to 4-7 in 
the UAA, and 9-12 ove rail after the pair 
of games. The team also played at the 
University of Chicago on Sunday, an
other UAA rival.

The 1998-1999 Carnegie 
Mellon mens basketball season 
must be especially disappointing 
for the seniors. Ayear that started 
,out as one of growth and promise 
ihas quickly become one that can 
be written off as development and 
a learning experience. Develop
ment that, unfortunately for the 
seniors, has resulted in little suc
cess and very few wins.
The Tartans finished off one of 
their longest homestands of the 
year last Sunday, February 7, 
with a disappointing loss to the 
Brandeis Judges. The loss put 
them at 1-3 on the four-game
homestand against University 
Athletic Association opponents.
Sundays loss was tough to 
swallow, since the Tartans had 
been looking to avenge a lastsecond defeat to the Judges a 
week earlier. The Brandeis team 
was also in much the same posi
tion as the Tartans  a young 
team that is struggling in the 
UAA, but has nowhere to go but 
up. Nevertheless, CMU dropped 
the game 85-78 and saw their 
UAA record sink to 2-8.
Looking to snap out of yet an
other three-game losing streak, 
the Tartans took their game on 
the road to Gambier, Ohio last 
Tuesday to face the Kenyon Col
lege Lords. This game repreTartan file photoFirst-year guard Ralph Deabrunzzo attempts to get by a Johns Hopkins 
defender. The team lost all three games last week.
sented an excellent opportunity 
for the team to regroup and sal
vage a win in the dwindling sea
son, as the Lords were also strug
gling with a 3-14 record. Clearly, 
it should have been an evenly 
matched game if nothing else.
The Tartans looked good early, 
and were able to avoid digging 
themselves into an early firsthalf deficit, one of their worst 
habits of late. Solid field-goal 
shooting  12 of 25 from the 
field and 75 percent from the 
free-throw line  kept the Tar
tans from fallingbehind. Kenyon 
countered with 12 of 30 shoot
ing, but ran dry outside, sinking 
only one of nine three-point at
tempts. The Carnegie Mellon 
men went into the locker room 
at halftime with a narrow 
31-28 lead.
Something happened in the 
Kenyon locker room during the 
half, however. Three-point 
shooting that looked like 
Shaquille ONeal from the free 
throw line on a bad day in the 
first half suddenly began to re
semble a Larry Bird/Michael Jordan McDonalds commercial. In 
a word, the Lords got hot. They 
sank 10 of 14 three-pointers, 
eight of 10 free throws, and 58 
percent of their total field goal 
attempts in the second 
20 minutes.

Volleyball takes on top teams
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
A goal of any sports team is to 
compete against the highest pos
sible level of competition. The 
CMU mens volleyball club went 
above and beyond that goal when 
they played in the Ter
rapin Invitational Tour
nament over the weekend of Feb
ruary 6-7.
Along with host University of 
Maryland, the tournament fea
tured 11 other teams, most from 
big-name Division I schools, in
cluding the University of Mas
sachusetts (UMass), the Univer
sity of North Carolina (UNC), 
and Georgetown University. 
Obviously, we werent going into 
the tournament looking to win, 
said club president Yasu Oba. 
We were going in looking for a 
chance to learn.
Going into the competition, the 
Tartans had to be careful not to 
be awed by their opponents. 
Most of the players on the team 
this year are first-years, said 
Oba. They have never seen that 
level of competition.
The tournament began early 
Saturday, February 6 with 
round-robin pools. Through the 
luck of the draw, the Tartans 
ended up in a group with UMass, 
UNC, and Rutgers. Not surpris
ingly, the Tartans lost all three
matches, but were still upbeat 
heading into the evenings conso
lation matches. After another 
loss, this time to Drexel Univer
sity, the Tartans pulled off per
haps the surprise of the week
end, winning their final match of 
the day over Georgetown.
Sunday morning, the Tartans 
played their final match of the 
tournament, losing to the Uni
versity of Virginia. CMUs 1-5 
record placed the team ninth out 
of the 12-team field, but the Tar
tans returned home very pleased 
with their performance.
[The tournament] was a good 
boost for the team, Oba said.
The experience of having played 
teams of that caliber will help 
later in the season against the 
tougher in-conference teams.
Returning to the more evenlymatched competition of Division 
III, the Tartans traveled to Grove 
City last Saturday for a tri-match 
with Grove City College and 
Mercyhurst College. In the days 
first match, the Tartans took on a 
weaker Mercyhurst team and 
took control early, winning the 
first game of the best-of-three 
match 15-5.
Having had such an easy time 
in the first game, the Tartans

ties and social sciences unde
clared student and Activities 
Board Special Events Chair, 
said that Sex Week was an 
annual event until 1994.
The decision to revive the 
event occurred to both organiz
ers at about the same time.
I saw Sex Week on an old Tshirt in an art exhibit here, and
it got me thinking that I wanted 
to do something like that again, 
said Pester.
Brann said she came up with 
the same idea as well, but 
through different means. Part 
of SDC is going to conferences 
three times a year, where other 
schools make presentations and 
share their program ideas, she 
said. A much small
er school in Akron 
talked about having 
their annual Sex 
Week. I [thought it 
would be something 
to do here, but on a 
larger scale.
The two organiz
ers explain that the 
purpose of Sex Week 
99 is to get across to all CMU 
students the various aspects of 
modern sexual relations while 
giving them an enjoyable time 
and a loosened atmosphere at 
the events.
While most college students 
spend a lot of time thinking 
about sex, we rarely ever talk 
about it, said Brann. Its such a
huge part of life. You can relate 
sex to pretty much everything. 
The planning for Sex Week 
began early this semester with a 
brainstorming session, in which 
the organizers listed every pos
sible topic, event, and idea. Im 
an RA, so I knew that working 
with roommates would be 
important, as well as sexual

health and safety issues. We 
also considered what would be 
fun, what would draw students, 
and what needed to be talked 
about, said Brann.
Both Brann and Pester regret
ted not being able to include 
more about gender and sexuality 
issues. We tried to get on-campus student groups like ALLIES
and cmuOUT to provide speak
ers and events, but at the last 
minute, they didnt come 
through. By then, we didn?t have 
enough time to contact other 
groups off-campus, said Pester.
The events themselves provid
ed entertainment both for the 
organizers and the attendees. 
Dr. Ruth was really a great per
son, said Brann. Shes very 
animated and energetic ... more 
than we were expecting a 71- 
year-old woman to be.
Another event was the Ball
room Dance Clubs Dirty Danc
ing Tuesday night in Rangos. 
[I heard thatl there was this 
girl there.... She was wearing a 
pair of jeans with the butt com
pletely cut out, said Pester. 
She attracted a crowd of her 
own, said Brann. I think she 
may have really contributed to 
the popularity of that event, 
because there were a lot of peo
ple just walking by who decided 
to come in and start dancing.

Not too often is someone standing in 
the heart of the University Center, 
shouting Condoms! You want a con
dom? Here, you need a condom! Its 
also not every day that several hun
dred college students flock to hear a 
grandmother talk about sex.
Last Thursday night, in the spirit of 
Sex Week 99, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, 
one of the most identifiable psychosexual therapists in the world, spoke to 
a sold-out crowd that slightly exceeded 
the seating capacity of McConomy 
Auditorium in the University Center. 
She spoke on her views of sexual 
behavior, protection, and responsibility.
I may come across as being quite 
explicit by using such words as penis, 
vagina, lubrication, and erection, she 
said. But, these all relate to a subject 
matter and its responsibilities that 
need to be taken quite seriously.
Westheimer opened her discussion 
by mentioning her extensive back
ground in the field of human sexuality.
Now 71 years old, a German-born mar
ried mother of two and grandmother of 
one, she has had a great deal of educa
tion and experience from which her 
talks are inspired. Westheimer studied 
psychology at the Sorbonne in Paris, 
then in 1956 obtained her masters 
degree in sociology from the Graduate 
Faculty of the New School of Social 
Research and doctorate of education in 
the interdisciplinary study of family 
from Columbia University. From her 
experiences working for Planned Par
enthood after her studies at Columbia, 
Westheimer was inspired to further 
her education on human sexuality at 
the New York Hospital-Cornell Univer
sity Medical Center.
During a research study concerning 
the historical effectiveness of contra
ceptives, she noticed that her sessions 
with patients would always lead to the 
same topic of discussion.
All they do is talk about sex, I said 
to myself, and that is a very interest
ing subject matter, Westheimer said. 
At Cornell, she became an adjunct 
associate professor, and later taught at
other collegiate institutions, including 
Columbia and West Point.
The United States has the best data 
on sexual research, she said, and from 
that, she put to rest several myths 
regarding sexual behavior amid the 
laughs of those in attendence. It has 
been said that a lesson taught in 
humor is a lesson attained, but I dont 
know if that is possible in computer 
science, she said.
By citing some of her own patients 
delusions, Westheimer eloquently dis
credited common misconceptions 
regarding masturbation habits, meth
ods of contraception, and sexually 
transmitted diseases.
Though initially comical, West
heimer became quite serious as she 
stressed the absolute necessity for pro
tection and responsibility in any sexu
al interaction. Dont let anyone pres
sure you into anything. Everyone 
needs to make that decision them
selves, and be able to accept the 
responsibilities that go along with that 
decision, Westheimer said. If you are 
sure you are able to do that, then make

front of a capacity crowd in McConomy Auditorium last Thursday night.
sure you are always protected. Any
thing is better than an unintended 
pregnancy or contracting a sexually 
transmitted disease.
When asked about her views regard
ing global issues, Westheimer was
prompt to state her opinion. In regard 
to homosexuality, she said she treats a 
homosexual couple in the same man
ner as anyone else. Respect, in these 
cases, is a non-debatable issue, WestPlease see THERAPIST, page L3

Two students participate in a role-playing exercise as part of the interactive lecture 
Creative Dating: The Cure for the Common Relationship last Wednesday.
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon is not 
renowned as a party school. 
And, in fact, if you ask the 
average CIT or CS student 
about their dating life, 
youll likely be met with a 
blank stare of incomprehen
sion. So as part of Student 
Dormitory Councils (SDC) 
Sex Week activities, SDC 
brought in speaker Scott 
Scheel last Wednesday to 
present Creative Dating: 
The Cure for the Common 
Relationship.
Scheel began the twohour presentation by having
the audience members of a 
half-full McConomy audito
rium fill out index cards, 
writing down their fantasy 
date on one side of the card 
and the best or worst pickup 
line they had ever heard on 
the other. Throughout the 
rest of the presentation, he 
read a card or two every 
time an audience member, 
called out, Fantasy!
Oh, heres a great one  
youre going to love this, 
Scheel would say before 
reading one of the cards. 
This is the all-time worst 
pickup line ever: Oh, Im 
sorry. I thought that was a 
braille nametag. 
Scheel mixed humor and 
one-liners with short slide 
presentations, advice, and 
audience interaction as he 
progressed through his pre
sentation. Near the presen
tations beginning, he asked 
volunteers from the audi
ence to step forward and 
relate best and worst dates 
that theyd been on. Later, 
he instigated a battle of the 
sexes, asking audience 
members what they wanted 
the other gender to know. 
All the men had to sit on 
their hands, and women in 
the audience called out the 
things they wished men 
knew about women.
If you say youre going to 
call, call!
Dont be late!
Have ideas about what 
youd like to do!
Then Schell gave all of the 
males in the audience their 
chance, yielding comments 
such as, Dont layer on the 
makeup! and Dont correct 
our grammar or point out 
what were doing wrong!
I really enjoyed the pre
sentation, said Stephen 
Piercy, an H&SS unde
clared first-year who volun
teered to tell his dream 
date story to the audience.

Health vendors hawk 
their products at CMU
By LIN TAO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
When was the last time you had a 
free massage? Last Thursday, free back 
massages were just one of the services 
given at the annual Health and Fitness 
Fest. Local health consultants and 
medical professionals gathered in Rangos Hall from 10 am to 3 pm to show
case their latest and greatest products, 
as well as give various medical advice 
and suggestions. Participating parties 
included chiropractors, a podiatry spe
cialist, reflexology specialists, and a fit
ness equipment guru.
Among the Fests participants was 
reflexologist Dorit Brauer. Reflexology 
is a unique and natural treatment 
whereby the entire 
body may be treated 
through gently mas
saging the reflex 
points which are locat
ed in the feet. Reflex
ology has become 
more popular in 
recent times because 
many people have 
seemed to realize that 
there are limitations to western hightech medicine.
[Reflexology] is an active healing 
process. When a person goes to the 
western doctor they are prescribed a 
drug and its a passive healing process, 
said Brauer. What I try to do is to 
involve the patient in an active role in 
healing themselves.
Another highlight of this years 
Health and Fitness Fest was the free 
massages given by Dr. Scott G. Ander
son with his state-of-the-art G-5 Work
out Massager.
There is heat coming through the 
massager, and a five-minute session 
increases oxygen and stimulates blood 
flow, said Anderson.
According to Anderson, chiropractic 
therapy  the adjustment of the spine
 can change physical, mental, and 
chemical aspects of a patients body for 
the better. Many people seek chiro
practic therapy due to discomfort 
caused by stress, accidents, and post
natal processes.
No health exposition is complete 
without free drinks and food. Partners 
in Dynamics presented their Dynamic 
Whey high protein drink with all the 
essential amino acids and proteins.
The biggest difference between 
Dynamic Whey and other high-protein 
drinks is that we use Steve, which is a 
natural sweetener, rather than fructose 
or NutraSweet, said Harold Huff. We 
use only natural flavors.
Hoff and his business partner Matt 
Brozovich both are active bodybuilders.
In November, Brozovich placed in the 
USA Naturals bodybuilding competi
tion. He also won the Mr. Pittsburgh 
fitness title last year.
Other services given at the fair 
included free cholesterol and blood 
pressure tests. Dining Services also 
served up a delicious health soup. 
Free condoms and breast self-examina
tion doorhangers were distributed.
Many students seemed to feel that 
the vendors at the Fest accurately 
addressed the specific needs of those 
attending college.
I think the Health and Fitness Fest 
was a great resource. There were many 
opportunities to learn about how to 
improve my physical well-being while 
living on a busy schedule, said Andrew 
Glover, a sophomore history major.

Whats a good example of cre
ativity when designing a dorm 
room? Maybe putting a 
women's bathroom sign on 
your door in Hamerschlag 
House. Or displaying an exten
sive portfolio of emptied beer 
bottles along a windowsill.
But for Damon Smith, a , 
junior architecture major, a 
room needs much more than 
that. To decorate his tiny Donner single, Smith spent about 
six weeks designing and build
ing Park Street Place, a Disney-themed toy store front in 
his room, complete with lights, 
toys, and a dedication plaque. 
It reads, Built as a reminder 
that one can make his dreams 
come true with a little hard 
work, persistence, and most of 
all, imagination."
The Tartan recently caught 
up with Smith to talk about his 
work and the imagination 
which he used to create it.
The Tartan: In your own 
words, describe exactly what 
you have built.
Damon Smith: This is an oldfashioned toy shop from the 
19th century. I sort of wanted a 
cityscape, but I probably 
wouldnt be able to fit all of it 
in the room. When I first 
had the idea to build this, 
I wanted it to be realistic. 
The bricks used were going 
to be real bricks, for example.
As I was going along, I 
noticed that it was kind of tak
ing a Disney theme. So I made 
it look more romantic and it 
ultimately ended up with this 
cartoonish look.
TT: What motivated you to 
undertake a project like this? 
Why did you spend so much 
time on something that isnt 
part of a class, but for your 
own room?
DS: Ive built things with my 
hands a lot. Im also very dri
ven. Most people come up with 
an idea and dont pursue it. But 
when I come up with an idea, I 
say, I have to do this.
Since Ive come to CMU, Ive 
worked in architecture. They 
really stress very geometric 
architecture when designing a 
place. This is kind of nice, but 
its never really formed by hap
piness or how people feel when 
theyre there. Disney is a great 
place in that respect. Its not 
just because its in Florida or 
California, but theyre always 
able to do what they envision in 
order to make the visitor feel a 
certain way. I want to work 
with Disney and some of their
Smith spent about six weeks building Park Street Place, which includes a replica toy storefront.
TT: What was the building 
process like?
DS: It started with just star
ing at the blank wall for hours 
on end with a blank piece of 
paper. Once I had the idea of 
the building and the park next 
door, I went to Home Depot and 
bought some styrofoam insula
tion boards. I like building 
model trains, and some of the 
techniques I used to decorate 
the room were similar. When 
building model trains, you 
want to make things light and 
easy for one person to handle. 
That was important because I 
didnt have anyone else to help. 
It also has to be able to be 
taken down and apart easily.
I have so many different 
interests that I wanted to pre
sent in the piece, but I could 
only choose a few. Im interest
ed in toys, trains, Legos, and 
Disney, so I displayed them on 
the shelves of the toy store.
Imagineering projects which 
Im really interested in.
Theres also a big emphasis 
on how things are made. If 
theres a stone column, it has to 
be stone. But as for me, I 
wouldnt mind if its made out 
of plastic, as long as it makes 
people feel a certain way.
TT: Is there a name for this 
field of architecture that 
youre describing?
DS: Its called entertainment 
architecture  thats what Im 
trying to teach myself since no 
one will teach it to me. I want 
to build to entertain, almost 
like a TV show. I think its a 
large field, but its not really 
emphasized. There are restau
rants and hotels that are devel
oped to entertain a little, but 
the field itself hasnt really 
developed that much. I think 
the problem is that a lot of peo
ple dont hear about it until 
they get out of college. So Im
glad Im studying the field now 
while still in college.
TT: Do you think students at 
CMU are capable of projects 
like this?
DS: I like CMU because its a 
very creative and technical 
place. I see many interesting 
projects at the Wats:On? Festi
val. Even some of the Mobots 
and other technical projects 
demonstrate a lot of imagina
tion. I took some of my creativ
ity and imagination and put it 
into a project. I think other peo
ple are capable of doing the 
same with their creativity.
I wish I had built this in ; 
public place. I think its really 
important to build things that 
people enjoy. I want people to 
be glad that these things are 
going on at Carnegie Mellon.
TT: How did last weeks open
ing ceremony go?
DS: I put on a plaque and i 
big red ribbon. There was a lot 
of food that my RA brought, 
and we played Disney trivia 
games. It sounds kind of 
cheesy, but we had a lot of fun 
during that two hours. Its 
amazing how many people can 
fit into a small single [room].
TT: Now that its done, what 
do you think of your creation?
DS: Im so impressed by it. 
And even though its been built 
for a while, I still have trouble 
falling asleep because I love to 
just look at it.
Hopefully itll be up until the 
end of the semester. Its very 
stable, so it wont be falling 
apart any time soon. I bought 
cheap materials so I could just 
throw it in the dumpster when 
Im done. But after all of the 
work I did, I cant possibly take 
it down.

Columnist questions effect of antitrust law
The Geek Beat
by Ellen Beldner
Lets start with the basic mantra 
Microsoft is Evil.
'For the sake of argument, assume 
tfie worst: Bill Gates is the antichrist, 
and his VPs are the minions of the 
apocalyptic beast. Installing MS Word 
or Internet Explorer is the moral 
equivalent of getting 666 tattooed on 
your forehead. And if we push the reli
gion metaphor a bit too far, Microsoft 
with its omnipresent OS and desk
top software  forces the masses to 
convert to its evil ways. 
nThis is largely the premise that the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), Sun, 
FEetscape, and dozens of other smaller 
software vendors have been operating
under for the past eight months or so, 
as the DOJ tries to play trust-buster 
to Microsofts alleged monopoly on the 
OS market.
Now, I have no great love for 
Microsoft products, particularly its 
operating system* software. Visions of 
tangerine-colored iMacs occasionally 
dance in my head, and I had Linux 
installed on my PC for a while. But I 
really, sincerely hope that Microsoft 
wins the antitrust case that 
the DOJ levied against it. Why? 
Because Im not convinced that 
Microsoft is a monopoly.
Yes, certainly, Microsoft has engaged 
in dubious business practices. Im sure 
that, like any other red-blooded Amer
ican industry, it fantasizes about 
crushing its competition, detailing in 
colorful predatory memos a desire to 
cut off Netscapes air supply. I dont 
doubt that it would be terribly upset if 
the worlds companies decided to junk 
their Unix machines for NT servers.
But for anyone who finds commu
nism unpalatable, it is difficult to sup
port massive government intervention 
in the business practices of a given cor
poration. Certainly, theres precedent:
Witness the spectacular 1982 AT&T 
antitrust case that broke Ma Bell into 
a dozen Hydra-like spawn, and the 
grand-daddies of them all, the turn-ofthe-century demolition of the J.P. Mor
gan railroad trust and John Rocke
fellers Standard Oil. So why not main
tain the same sorts of size restrictions 
on a company that, today, has the 
same dominance over an industry as 
crucial as railroads were a hundred 
years ago?
Simple: The software industry isnt 
driven by physical capital the same way 
that railroads and oil companies are, 
and because of that, Microsoft can 
never create a monopoly to the extent 
that these other companies did. If John 
Rockefeller buys up every oil field in the 
world, no other companies have access 
to the raw materials that they would 
need to compete. Similarly, railroad 
monopolies were much easier to develop 
when companies received big land 
grants from the government, in order to 
build the nations transportation sys
tem. Just as Uncle Sam giveth, so does 
he taketh away when its land gift ends 
up precluding other companies from 
forming strong competing railroads.
Putting underhanded business prac
tices aside, Microsoft cant guarantee 
zero competition because there are no 
raw materials whose accumulation 
would quash competition. Anyone with 
sufficient computer science training 
can write his own OS; indeed, thats 
essentially how Linux came to be. 
Thousands of programmers patched 
together a very respectable operating 
system that is technically on a par 
with NT, lacking only the user-interface niceties that most consumers are 
used to. It will always be possible for 
someone to write a non-Microsoft pro
gram, because all it takes is brains  
and certainly Microsoft wont be able 
to buy up all of those.
More practically, however, the DOJ 
case has already done its work. Ideally, 
we would have a competitive market in 
which good companies earn their place 
at the top, but where other good prod
ucts also have an equal shot at the 
marketplace. The problem with 
Microsoft was that its products are not 
necessarily the best choices for all peo
ple, yet through strong-arm agree
ments with major PC manufacturers 
and Internet service providers, it
attempted to limit other software com
panies access to the marketplace.
What the suit has doneis empow
ered companies like Sun, Netscape, 
and America Online (AOL) to speak 
out against Microsoft. Before the suit, 
they were bullied into compliance with 
Microsofts yearnings for power. But 
the suit has started a chain reaction: 
Much like in elementary school, as 
soon as one person has the guts to tell 
the teacher on the bully, all the other 
kids start to be brave, and pretty soon 
they learn to band together when thp 
bully tries to take their lunch mone^. 
Thats what AOL and Netscape have 
done already.
So if you believe that Microsoft is 
pure evil, buy a Mac, get BeOS, or 
install Linux. And if you think that 
Microsoft is the best thing since multi
ple teraFLOPs, go ahead, install Inter
net Explorer.
And may the best company win - not 
the meanest.

 As part of the presentation, 
the attendees received four-page

gested everything from the more

I havent seen anything as 
extensive as CMUs Sex Week, 
he said. What we try to do with 
[the Creative Dating lecture] is 
dispel the myth that you have 
to spend a lot of money to have 
a great date.
THERAPIST, from page LI
heimer said. Its just that no 
one seems to know the reason 
why this occurs, and that is 
what makes it so interesting. 
rI thought it was especially 
interesting that she put all her 
cards on the table, no questions 
asked, said Joe Bernarding of 
Campus Police. Thats quite 
bold in todays society because 
you can never be quite sure 
about how people are going to 
react, especially in a university 
sfetting where these issues are 
constantly debated. 
Westheimer concluded by 
answering several questions 
from the audience on many dif
frent topics such as improving 
fminine orgasms, the G-spot, 
the best contraceptives, and
even one students concern on 
the healthiness of Internetbased relationships. She also 
cited from one of her most 
recently released books, Sex for 
Dummies, which is now avail
able in 20 different languages.
She is currently an adjunct 
associate professor at New York 
University, and a fellow of the 
New York Academy of Medicine. 
She has her own private prac
tice, and trains residents and 
interns on adolescent sexuality 
at Brookdale Hospital in New 
York City. Westheimers exper
tise has been spread through 
media such as radio, television, 
books, home video, and even 
computer software, to name a 
few. Her radio show, Sexually 
Speaking, which began in 1980
were given a result sheet con
taining their ten best matches 
with the opposite sex, as well as 
their two worst matches with 
the opposite sex and two best 
friends, the best matches with 
the same sex.
In addition to the increased 
response to the surveys, the 
attendence at the LoveFest was 
much greater than last years.
The number of people who 
attended LoveFest this year 
was over 200. Last year, we 
might have only broken 100, 
said Jean Vettel, a junior Eng
lish major and SDC residential 
programming committee chair. 
I think more people came this
year because we had the 
raffle and 23 prizes to give out. 
There was also more food 
and Valentines Day candy, 
more survey results, makeyour-own Valentines, condoms, 
and 80s music.
Brann said that for future 
Sex Weeks, she would like to 
see more events that get the 
audience involved. The interac
tive events were much more 
popular than the lectures deal
ing with the really important 
topics, said Brann.
Some of the future lectures 
may include a guest speaker 
who specializes in discussing 
subjects those particular sub
jects that everyone expects you 
to know but no one ever tells 
you, such as sex toys and oral 
sex, according to Brann.
I think we should have [Sex 
Week] again because people got 
out and were like, Sex! Lets go, 
said Melissa Stupka, a freshman 
Humanities and Social Sciences 
undeclared major.
I think [Sex Week] is somer 
thing that draws the campus 
out, a place where a lot of people 
dont get involved very often,! 
said April Gillespie, a sopho'r 
more music major. Sex Week is 
something everyone can have 
some interest in because of 
its subject.
Students learn dating hints
Scheel also follows his own 
hints. The other day, I was look
ing through the list [of creative 
dating ideas], seeing how many 
things my girlfriend and I had 
done, he said. We had done a 
lot, including the date where we 
volunteered at a soup kitchen.
Although it may be somewhat 
difficult getting a date at CMU, 
with its 60-to-40 male-female 
ratio, Scheel doesnt think that 
the ratio is an insurmountable 
obstacle for men who want a 
social life.
Your best bet is to surround 
yourself with people of like 
interests, Scheel said. It does
nt pay dividends to get involved 
with those people that you do 
not like.Speaker draws large crowd 
to hear tips on making love
as a taped 15-minute show Sun
days after midnight on WYNYFM (NBC) in New York, now 
airs for one hour starting at 10 
pm. She has won Ace Awards 
for excellence in educational 
television for such shows as 
The All-New Dr. Ruth Show. 
Westheimer frequently travels 
to various universities across 
the country, and has been 
named twice as College Lectur
er of the Year.
I mainly came just hear to 
Dr. Ruth because shes the Doc
tor Ruth, said Rhonda For
rester, a sophomore civil and 
environmental engineering 
major. It was awesome, 
though, because she made me 
think about things that I had 
not thought of before.

The Harder They Are The Farder They Chew
Belated and Bloated Valentine's Day Special!
by: James Kenney
When a publication is released weekly, 
the tradition is to put holiday specials in the 
issue preceding the holiday. As a teen rebel,
I feel it is my duty to say "Screw the system!" 
So without further introduction, please enjoy 
the The Harder They Are The Farder They Chew 
Valentines Day Special, after Valentines Day. 
[email jpkenney if you want a Valentine]
;s
ffck' *1'UM 'B
This year for Valentine's day I decided I would 
revel in the spirit of the holiday and ascertain 
myself a lover. The only way to ascertain a lover, 
of course, is to be her secret admirer. I decided 
to browse through the picture book of the 
college I attended, Mellonie Carnon. I noticed 
Jamie Kennedy on page 13 looked scrumptious. 
With great ease I obtained her email, phone 
number, address, and blood glucose record.
^Jeri'oN^/CoMMENTS: j.'sQuMcM POINTS: JO on *e. {'s JCy Cttjly.
I agreed with myself that my new lover might 
feel that we don't have enough us1 time. To 
make up for my fear of commitment, I decided 
to slip an anonymous note under her door 
reading, "When I watch you eat, I am satiated, 
when its night I hide in my closet in total 
darkness and shine a flashlight on the wall, 
you're the flashlight. I move it around gently. 
You are the light of my life, gentle Jamie."
I approached my sweet Jamie on Valentine's Day 
and asked her "Oh noblest Jamie, why have you 
neglected to call me?" She lurched around to 
are at me oddly and replied, "What the hell?" 
That's what I was wondering. I finally saw her up 
close for the first time. Her nose was a bit big, 
and frankly I didn't like the perfume she wore.
As Valentine's day drew to a close, I realized 
once again that true love will never be...

Smiley faces inspire late 
night treks to local diner
Justin Suissa/Tartan Art Staff
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Okay, its time to slap on the 
ball gowns and cummerbunds  
were going to Eat N Park.
Well, maybe thats overdoing it 
a bit. Go to the local Eat N Park 
in Squirrel Hill, and you can see 
for yourself that it is not a classy 
jacket-and-tie-required establish
ment, but rather, its of the no 
shirt, no shoes, no service vari
ety. Nevertheless, perhaps it is 
the come one, come all appeal of 
the restaurant which has helped 
make it the social scene it 
is today.
This idea made me begin to 
wonder how a local restaurant, 
a few meager notches above fastfood cuisine, could become one of 
the best - known social centers 
in Pittsburgh. What is it about 
that place that has young adults 
storming through its front 
entrance at 10 in the evening? I 
decided that the only way I 
would ever find out was to see 
for myself. With two friends in 
tow, I boarded the 61C bus 
and set out on a mission of per
sonal discovery.
It was 10:30 on a Friday night. 
Upon entering the fine establish
ment, the three of us were in
stantly whisked away to a nice,
comfortable nook right by the 
lavatory. There were people all 
around us  young people, older 
people, people with multiple 
piercings and oddly - shaped hair. 
Representatives of just about ev
ery demographic and walk of life 
populated that section.
Upon further inspection, I no
ticed that the bulk of the patrons 
were not eating substantial 
meals. This observation was my 
first clue that it was not the baked 
scrod which kept them coming 
back again and again. Nor was it 
the aesthetically pleasing salad 
bar, which was virtually ignored 
by restaura-goers absorbed in 
conversation. So if it wasnt the 
scrod or the salad, then what was 
keeping these people here? Its 
open all night, and you dont have 
to be 21, said Ken Nath, a firstyear student from the University 
of Pittsburgh.
Pam Baumiller, also a first-year 
at Pitt, noted the lack of available 
options at that late hour. Its 
either this or Dennys, she said.
I like the food, I like to talk to 
people and be with friends. 
And the foods kind of cheap, 
said Esther Bradley, a first-year 
H&SS student at CMU. But 
the Smiley cookie is kind of 
scary, and the frostings a bit 
too sweet.
That circle of frosted goodness, 
with a smile viewed by some as 
evil and maniacal, seems to be 
the key to Eat N Parks notori
ety. With Smiley Cookie watches 
and Smiley Cookie mugs leading 
the pack in Eat N Park merchan
dising, it is apparent that Eat N 
Park knows its on to something.
However, smiley cookies may 
not be for everyone, especially 
the five-and-under bracket.
When I was little, I couldnt 
eat them because they had a 
cute face, and I could only nibble 
around the edges, said Sarah 
Cypher, a first-year H&SS stu
dent. But now, as Ive grown 
more heartless with age, I 
can down the sucker without 
any remorse.
It would seem that Eat N Park 
is not merely the family restau
rant next door, but is rather an 
establishment which offers its pa
trons numerous reasons to come 
back again and again. It is not 
merely a cheap family restau
rant, but home to chronically 
bored students from all over the 
Pittsburgh area. Whether it be a 
keen taste for mediocre food at 
_ low prices, a desire for deep con
versation in a warm, inviting at
mosphere, or just a craving for 
smiley cookies, Eat N Park is 
there for you.
Student wanders local 
area searching for fun

Its a Friday or Saturday night. You 
know that you dont want to be mop
ing around your room all weekend. 
Theres nothing really going on on 
campus, and you really feel like get
ting out. Carnegie Mellon can really 
start to get on ones nerves after a 
while. So, the obvious next question 
is: What can you do at night?
I trekked from Oakland up through 
Squirrel Hill in search of something 
interesting. I began my search for ex
citement at Stratus, on Fifth Avenue. 
Stratus is one of the few clubs in Pitts
burgh that has a minimum age of 18 
and not 21. Stratus feels cramped, and 
the room appears to be falling apart. 
There is a strange smell in the air. But 
if youre under 21 and looking for some
where in Oakland to just go and dance, 
this might be your only option.
My posse and I were only at Stratus 
briefly. After we left, we continued our 
journey up Forbes Avenue. As we made 
our way up Forbes, we passed by Club 
Laga. On this particular evening, it 
was goth night, so we decided it would 
be best not to go inside.

Voices in movie raise attention
By AHNYA CHANG

Little Voice is your typical soft-spo
ken girl with hidden talent gets exploited 
by her tart of a mothers sleazy boy
friend while the sweet telephone repair 
' boy teaches her about homing pigeons 
. movie. You have your over-the-top char
acter actors. You have a classic 
soundtrack full of sultry chanteuse standards. You have oft-decorated British
What: Little Voice 
Director: Mark Herman 
Company: Miramax Rims 
Starring: Jane Horrocks, Brenda 
Blethyn, Ewan McGregor, and 
Michael Caine
stage stars and lots of British slang
 (Give us a kiss, love!). You have the
 former-heroin-addict-soon-to-be-lightsaber-wielding Ewan McGregor. Chalk 
up another winner for Miramax.
This is a sweet, heartwarming, funny, 
sometimes racy, and very British movie. 
Little Voice, also known as L.V., (Jane 
Horrocks) is a painfully shy young girl 
who never goes out and is daunted 
 by the brassy personality and promiscu
ous lifestyle of her widowed mother
- (Brenda Blethyn).
Seeking glory in her humdrum life, 
Mom hooks up with flashy show-biz man 
Ray Say (Michael Caine). Neglected and 
extremely devoted to her dead father, 
L.V. plays his records of Shirley Bassey, 
Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe, 
sometimes singing along to comfort her
self. Her remarkable ability to imitate 
the vocal styles of these great ladies 
allows her to be discovered by would-be 
talent scout Ray, who sees in L.V. his 
own ticket to the top. Meanwhile, Billy 
(Ewan McGregor), a soft-spoken tele
phone repairman, takes a liking to L.V., 
and sweetly forces her to accept him as 
a friend.
The story is set in northern England, 
in the small town of Scarborough, and 
while we are not shown much about the 
town itself or about the lifestyles of its 
residents, it is obvious that a seaside 
town is the perfect setting for the story.
The plot, like the town, is sleepy, in a 
beautiful Sunday morning kind of way, 
and there really isnt much to it. It doesnt 
matter, though, because the story is 
obviously not meant to be plot-driven. 
Its strength lies in its characters and in 
what drives them to do what they do.
The antagonists of the film  L.V.s 
mother, Ray Say, and the seedy club 
owner Mr. Boo  are alternately infuri
ating and tragic. We are able to 
see much loneliness and hurt 
underneath their repulsive, and alco
holic exteriors.
L.V. herself is extremely charming in 
her silence, and even though she fights 
the prospect of conversation for most of 
the film, when she does speak, she proves 
to be very observant and honest. Her 
talent for impersonation is clearly a pro
jection of the love she feels for her father 
and the love she felt from him when she 
sang his favorite songs.
The character of Billy is pretty twodimensional, but he does occasionally
make some very profound observations 
about his hobby, raising homing pigeons.
There are abundant references to birds 
throughout the film. Not only do many 
people tell Little Voice stories about 
caged birds singing, birds being set free, 
and nurtured birds singing the sweetest 
songs, but eventually L.V. herself 
emerges from a huge cage in her stage 
show at Mr. Boos club.
The metaphor is pretty obvious. The 
final image in the movie is of L.V. help
ing Billy release some of his pigeons as 
words appear on the screen proclaiming 
that Jane Horrocks performed all of her 
own songs.
Horrocks is an indisputable star in 
this film, her singing talent notwith
standing. Her timid yet wide-eyed por
trayal of Little Voice was perfect, and I 
was not at all surprised to discover that 
The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, the 
stage play on which the film is based, 
was written with her in mind.
Brenda Blethyn, Michael Caine, and 
the supporting actors are also strong. 
Some of the dialogue is difficult to un
derstand due to the heavy northern 
English accents, but its not a 
huge loss.
The film is still extremely funny, and 
as far as risqu material goes, even I 
occasionally found myself with my jaw 
hanging open. After recounting a sexual 
conquest in lurid detail with a friend, 
L.V.s mother finds a restaurant full of 
people staring at her in shock. Whutre 
yew lookin at? she says. Yewre own 
shag in a Chevy? Who says the British 
are reserved?
Artist uses videos 
to portray his world
By SARAAMODIO
Tartan Staffwriter
Peter Sarkisians show Rare Drop, 
at the downtown Wood Street Galler
ies, succeeds in combining art and 
video. Moving images and shadows 
are cast upon objects to bring the tex
tures and visual elements of film into 
close confrontation. In doing so, 
Sarkisian has found a way to com
pletely engage viewers through his 
illusory pieces.
Murray Horne, curator of Wood 
Street Galleries, commented, We 
havent seen that in video art  the 
object and illusion are presented at 
the same time. Sarkisians latest 
work, Dusted (1998), is the most 
cinematic piece in the show; a bright 
white cube sits in the middle of a dark 
room. Heavy whispering is heard as 
the cube darkens, and lying inside of 
the cube, there are two people brush
ing the cubes blackness away, just 
enough for the viewer to see what is 
happening inside. Their nude bodies 
carry this black residue as they writhe 
and twist and attempt to get comfort
able. Never resting, the bodies con
tinue to reposition themselves as a 
womans voice  actually a sloweddown male voice  calls out male and 
female names. One could interpret 
Dusted as being a uterus anticipating 
a child, or it could be a recollection of
lovers from the past being carried psy
chologically into an existing sitiuation 
with the next partner.
There are three more works on the 
second floor. The piece Rare Drop, which 
the show is named after, is captivating. 
Two bowls, one green and one blue, re
ceive projected drops, and the splashes 
fizzle. The crafted drops land in a loud 
but slow rhythm, which leaves onlook
ers crouching in anticipation for the next 
one to come.
In the same room lie two beds, each of 
which holds a very strange pillow. What 
makes the piece unusual is the projec
tion above. The curator noted that this is 
a projection of material upon material. 
A moving object or creature moves un
derneath the top of the pillowcase. The 
light is not simply falling on the pillow; 
it is causing movement within it.
In Roadside Series No. 1, the viewer 
finds a pair of womens slippers on a 
suitcase in one room and a pair of mens 
shoes placed on a suitcase in a second 
room. Even if the two pieces are sepa
rated, one can clearly identify the rela
tionship between the slippers. Shadows 
pass over the slippers and shoes.
In Rare Drop, varying light and space 
are used to create diverse moods. Th 
unanswered questions  Who is drop
ping water? Who is in the cube? What is 
creating these shadows?  leave view
ers more sensitive to the formal aspects 
of Sarkisians work.Dance clubs offer venues for individual expression

My theory on life has always 
been that youve got to try every
thing once. Thats why when I 
heard that Paramount would be 
filming a new Michael Douglas 
film called Wonder Boys on our 
campus, and they would be look
ing for extras, I knew I had to give 
it a shot.
Together with three of my 
friends, 1 ventured downtown 
to the Nancy Moser Casting 
Agency, where they asked us 
to fill out 
short ap
plications 
with our 
hours of avail
ability, experi
ence, and measure
ments. Then they 
took Polaroid pic
tures of each of us.
The gentleman 
manning the of
fice looked over 
our applica
tions and 
asked us if we 
were available 
on the follow
ing Wednes
day. The four of 
us looked at each 
other, and, blinded 
by fame and fortune, 
nodded our dumb
founded heads in 
approval.
Class? What?
Im actually at 
Carnegie Mellon 
for an education?
Visions of bright 
lights and cameras filled 
our eyes. The man told us 
what to bring and what to 
wear, and asked us to call 
the casting agency Tues
day night to find out what 
time we needed to be at 
the site.
Wednesday morning came at 
last. With bags of typical col
lege student clothing and props 
in hand, I journeyed to the base 
of Flagstaff Hill where Para
mount had setup shop. Call time 
for all extras was 7:30 am.
Our first stop after filling out 
paperwork was the wardrobe 
trailer, where the costume artist 
checked to see if our clothes were 
appropriate. Bright colors like 
my friends royal blue windbreaker were out; they would 
draw attention away from the 
action of the scenes.
We had a catered breakfast 
back in the tent, and waited for 
about an hour. As I scanned the 
crowd, I suddenly felt very inse
cure about my marketability. 
There were adults who looked 
stereotypically professorial, guys 
with trendy, expensive clothing, 
and tall, gorgeous girls carrying 
tote bags from modeling agen
cies. They must have been look
ing for a short redhead, 
because it wasnt long 
before one of the pro
duction people came 
over, tapped me on
the shoulder, and 
said, well 
take you. 
The prod u c t i o n 
people ush
ered us into 
Baker Hall 
where the 
head pro
duction asi I sistant told
\ /us what we
would be film
ing. The scene 
that we would be 
included in was one 
of the first in the movie. Basi
cally, Michael Douglas charac
ter would be walking down the 
first set of steps in Baker Hall, 
and out the front doors. We would 
be students milling around in the 
halls and outside. Then they di
vided the group into two based on
how nice our shoes looked. I kid 
you not! They looked at all of our 
feet, and took the 10 of us who 
had the nicest shoes outside.
We, spent about three hours 
practicing walking back an 
forth, for a scene that lasted about 
30 seconds. It was cold, and damp, 
because they had wetted down 
the sidewalk in front of Baker for 
the scene. The elderly man, with 
whom I was supposed to con
verse during the scene up and 
left about halfway through, claim
ing that his short career in film 
was too cold and too laborious, 
and therefore was ending 
right there. But the rest of us 
held out. Finally we shot the ac
tual scene. We were slightly up
set to find out that the scene was 
being shot inside, and that we 
would only be seen as bodies 
through the doors.
Frostbitten and frustrated, w 
came inside. They gave us  
snack, and promptly put us baclk 
to work. Fortunately, since w 
had braved hours outside, we 
were heavily rewarded. The same 
scene was going to be shot again, 
but from a different angle, anci 
we would be much more visible 
this time. The production liaison 
picked another Carnegie Mellon 
student and I to walk down th? 
Baker Hall steps just behind 
Michael Douglas! His double,  
man who looked very similar to 
Michael Douglas, ran through th 
scene a few times to get the lightn
ing and camera angles down propr 
erly. Then the real Michael Dour 
glas came in and we filmed the 
scene. We were in such awe of 
his presence that we performed 
to the best of our pathetic 
roles ability.
After that was done, we were 
sent back to the tent, where w$ 
had another catered meal. Afteif 
lunch, the remaining extras wer 
called to go film another scene in 
the College of Fine Arts parking 
lot. The morning people stayed 
in the comfort of the heated terit 
and played cards all afternoon. 
At six, the parking lot people came 
back, and we were dismissed. 
Tired, but well fed and famous;, 
we crawled back to our dorms i|i 
exhausted bliss.
Maybe well only be on earner^ 
for the bat of an eye, or maybe not 
even that, but being an extra in 
Wonder Boys was a pretty amaz
ing experience. Will I do it again)* 
Well, I figure, Ive only exhausted 
about 20 seconds of my 15 min^- 
utes of fame ... theres still a lqt 
of living to do, right?

If sex, drugs, loud music, and esoteric imagery is 
your bag, baby, then this movie is for you. Set up to 
be a prequel to the Twin Peaks television series, Fire 
Walk With Me, a 1992 movie, begins with the inves
tigation of the death of a local waitress. Then it 
delves into the murder of Laura Palmer, played by 
Sheryl Lee, an actress who has been in a bunch of 
movies that I know Ive never heard of. The death of 
Laura Palmer motivated much of the Twin Peaks

Fail-Safe
Its the end of the world, as we know it. But FailSafe doesnt threaten with aliens and computer 
viruses. This 1964 oldie but goodie relies on the first 
man-made weapon of total and complete destruc
tion: nuclear warfare!
The Pentagon accidentally tells a squadron of B52 bombers to take out Moscow, and the rest of the 
movie centers around the efforts of the Americans 
and Russians to prevent the bombing. Based on a 
book of the same name written by Eugene Burdick 
and Harvey Wheeler, Fail-Safe takes place during 
the heat of the Cold War, and takes on the issues 
of communism and nuclear disaster. Lead roles are 
played by Walter Matthau, Henry Fonda, and

War tragedy tears friends apart
By DEREK DREYER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
There is a shuffling of footsteps 
as a group of men are led into a 
stark room to be executed. Next, 
a child is playing on a swing, 
followed by a young man enter
ing a classroom. Finally, Jason 
Robards is sitting in a trance on a 
park bench, suddenly awaking to 
the screams of his granddaugh
ter as she is chased by a dog. This 
is a catchy opening for the film 
Reunion, but can we really ex
pect a movie on Holocaust-related 
themes nowadays to unravel this 
dream in a new and edifying way?
No matter. The film, written by 
playwright Harold Pinter (Be
trayal) and directed by Jerry 
Schatzberg {The Panic in Needle 
Park), approaches its material 
with a lean, almost conventional 
style that allows its power to seep 
in slowly and surely, its myster
ies to be explained in due course. 
There are no jolts, no shocks. The 
Holocaust didnt happen in a day.
After the Robards character, 
Henry (Hans) Strauss, informs 
his daughter that he has to take 
care of this ... thing, we follow 
him back to his hometown of 
Stuttgart, Germany, which he has 
not visited since he lived there as 
a teenager, 50 years prior. The 
town has, of course, changed. It 
has lost some of the idyllic Ger
man beauty we see much of in the 
long flashback that dominates 
the film and has become more
like the rest of the world at 
the time.
As a young man in 1932, Hans 
(Christien Anholt) befriends the 
wealthiest and brightest student 
in his class, Konradin von 
Lohenburg (Samuel West), who
anti-Semitism is rampant in 
Stuttgart, although Nazism 
hasnt quite taken a stronghold 
yet. Hans father, a World War I 
veteran and proud German, is 
confident the German people will 
see through all the rubbish.
seems reluctant to invite him into 
his palatial home. We learn later 
that there is good reason for this: 
Hans is a Jew, and Konradins 
mother an anti-Semite. In fact, 
as we and Hans learn, casual
Justin Sulssa/Tartan Art Staff
Needless to say, they dont. 
Much of the film is devoted to the 
poignant interaction between 
Hans and Konradin as they muse 
about God, politics, and sex 
(which they decide at one point is
tantamount to eating a sand
wich to satisfy ones hunger), in 
the midst of an increasingly vola
tile social situation. Thankfully 
the film doesnt beat us over the 
head with some overbearing sense 
of purpose, but rather subtly uses 
the two boys tenuous friend
ship to generate a genuine long
ing for what might have been 
and a fear of what actually was.
Of course, any Holocaust 
flashback film, as one might 
bluntly categorize this one, must 
end up being compared to Alan 
J. Pakulas Sophies Choice, and 
Jason Robards is no Meryl 
Streep. However, Reunion is not 
presenting the Holocaust from 
the point of view of someone 
who lived through it. Instead, it 
examines someone who feels a 
void for having left before any
thing happened.
In the framing episodes, 
Strauss searches for his boy
hood friend, but no one he speaks 
to is particularly helpful. Per
haps the Germans are just 
tired of pesky, fully American
ized Jews trying to reclaim 
their homeland. Or perhaps it is 
easier to simply memorialize the 
atrocities of yesteryear and for
get them.
Reunion was shown last Thurs
day as part of the Jewish/Israeli 
film festival at the Carnegie Mu
seum of Art, which continues 
sporadically throughout the 
next month.Energetic performance lacks unity
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Webmaster
Saturday nights Soundbytes concert 
was the second in a series designed to 
attract a younger audience to the 
world of classical music. The concert was 
well-presented, but it fell short 
of expectations.
Hosts and former L.A. Law stars Jill 
Eikenberry and Michael Tucker, a 1966 
CMU alum, did a good job of entertaining 
the audience between pieces and were able 
to subtly incorporate a good deal of music 
history into their repertoire. Eikenberry 
and Tuckers performance was marred only 
by the fact that Tucker continually tripped 
over his words as he read from two large 
teleprompters.
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO) was led by guest conductor 
Alessandro Siciliani, music director of the 
Columbus Symphony Orchestra. The 
evening began with an energetic perfor
mance of the Prelude to Act One from 
Georges Bizets Carmen.
Following the excerpt from Carmen were 
excerpts from Mozarts Cosi Fan Tutte and 
The Marriage of Figaro. Opera singer Detra 
Battle performed, in English, In Men, In 
Soldiers? an amusing piece about the short
comings of men, and Kevin Deas performed 
Open Your Eyes, which countered the 
claims made in the piece performed by
Battle. Battles and Deass performances were 
both outstanding.
One of the highlights of the evenings was the 
performance of Don Juan by the PSO under 
the direction of PSO music director Mariss 
Jansons. Jansons graceful direction of the 
piece provided a pleasant change from the 
overzealous arm-flapping of Siciliani. Upon 
conclusion of the piece, Jansons offered his 
personal views on the relationship between 
love and music.
Without aid from the teleprompter, Jansons 
first spoke of his days in Russia and remem
bered how any talk about the subject of love 
between humans had been strictly taboo. He 
recalled how he was only permitted to speak of 
love for communism. Jansons said that music, 
like love, comes directly from the heart and is 
instrumental to human existence. He then 
reminded the audience that many of the great
est compositions were inspired by the intense 
emotional experience of being in love.
The next portion of the program shifted in 
tone, and contained pieces that conveyed the 
pain and bittersweet longing of romantic ex
perience. To commence this portion of the 
evening, Battle and Deas returned for a per
formance of selections from George Gershwins 
Porgy and Bess.
After the intermission, the program finally 
began to take shape as a clear theme emerged 
in the form of Shakespeares tragedy Romeo 
and Juliet. Siciliani conducted the first two 
suites from Sergi Prokofievs Romeo and Juliet
and then The Feud from Peter Ilyich 
Tchaikovskys version of Romeo and Juliet.
Opera singers Jane Jennings and Rolando 
Villazon performed Tonight from Leonard 
Bernsteins West Side Story, and then 
the clock was turned back as Siciliani again 
conducted Prokofievs version of Romeo 
and Juliet.
FollowingProkofiev, Matt Bomer and Mar
garet Baisch, senior drama majors, acted out 
the balcony scene from Shakespeares Romeo 
and Juliet, after which the orchestra playd 
another selection from Tchaikovskys Romeo 
and J uliet. Bomer and Baisch returned to the 
stage for the final scene of the play in which 
Romeo and Juliet both commit suicide. Fi
nally, Jennings and Villazon performed 
the heart-wrenching Somewhere from West 
Side Story.
Overall the singers, actors, and orchestra 
did a commendable job of executing the pieces. 
However, the structure of the evening was 
weak, and the audience was often left hang
ing because the orchestra only played frag
ments of several great works. Guest conduc
tor Sicilianis excessive energy farther exac
erbated the problem, because he built 
up dramatic expectations that were never 
quite fulfilled.
Next week, the PSO will feature Pinchas 
Zukerman performing the world premiere 
of Marc Neikrugs Violin Concerto No. 2 
and Bachs Violin Concerto No. 1 in 
A minor.Undergrad looks for late-night events
NIGHT, from page L9
Later on, we passed the Bee
hive, a combined coffeehouse and 
movie theater. I didnt visit the 
Beehive on this particular trip, 
but I have been there before. I 
really enjoyed the movie theater 
and the popcorn. One giant bot
tomless bowl of popcorn sells for 
three or four bucks, and bever
ages are pretty cheap too.
Inside of the theater, there are 
some nice lounge chairs and 
tables in addition to the typical 
movie theater chairs. Also, they

ies and independent films rather 
than mainstream movies. For in
stance, this past weekend, Gods 
and Monsters, the film for 
which Ian McKellen was nomi
nated for an Academy Award, 
was playing. The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show is a regular fea
ture as well.
From the Beehive, we took a 
bus past Pitt and CMU up to 
Squirrel Hill. While I am sure 
that Squirrel Hill is a wonderful 
place to go during the day and 
even the evening, at 1:30 in the 
morning it is not the most hap
pening place on the planet.
However, if I had been a little 
bit earlier, I could have visited 
Barnes and Noble, which is open 
until 11 pm every night. While 
that is not exactly my idea of a 
fun hangout place, Ive seen many 
people reading and shopping 
through the window when I have 
been there before.
They also have bowling on For
ward Avenue in Squirrel Hill. I 
love bowling. Maybe its some 
kind of Polish Zen thing, but I 
think that its one of the greatest 
activities ever invented. It is not
even the act of bowling itself. 
Theres something about the at
mosphere. Maybe its the lowgrade shoe sterilizer spray mixed 
with cigar smoke wafting through 
the air thats giving me some 
weird chemical buzz, but I think 
its great.
While this may not be the cul
tural center of the East Coast, 
Pittsburgh does provide its resi
dents with many opportunities 
for social interaction. With an 
open mind, bus fare, and an empty 
stomach, there will always be a 
place for you.

Mardi Gras  Fat Tuesday  is a day of parades and carnivals, which mainly happens in New 
Orleans. Four days of festivities started last Saturday and run until Tuesday The history of Mardi 
Gras goes back to the 17th century when the French-Canadian explorer, Sieur d'Iberville and his 
men camped 60 miles south of New Orleans, a place Sieur d'Iberville named Pointe du Mardi 
Gras. Soon after, French settlers started celebrating this holiday in the New World. Ever since, it 
has gone through times that it was banned and forbidden, but in the 19th century it was widely 
celebrated with masked ball and parades. In the parades there are several "Krewes," which are 
the masking and parading clubs for which New Orleans is famous and infamous. Today thou
sands of people go to New Orleans every year to celebrate Mardi Gras. On the day of the carnival, 
people wear anything from a flamboyant dress to jeans and a t-shirt. People drink and dance all 
night long on the day of Mardi Gras. I guess it's an excuse to party no matter what.
