Fraternities consider proposal banning kegs
By HSIN-I CHOW
Tartan Photo Staff Manager
The Inter-Fraternity Council 
s reviewing a proposal which 
would ban all fraternities from 
having kegs.
The proposal also includes the 
termination of all open parties, 
fraternities would have to write 
;up a guest list and would have to 
distinguish guests over the age 
of 21. According to the policy, 
[guests would be required to 
present two distinct, non-transiferable marks at the bar, includ
ing a stamp and identification, j The nationals have been com
ing down on the chapters, so 
every chapter has to follow some 
type of policy like this, says IFC 
president Christian Bareford. 
Even more strict actually, then 
the IFC social policy which is
under FIPG or risk manage
ment.
Thus far the only two frater
nity houses on campus that have 
not had pressure from their na
tionals are Kappa Sigma and Pi 
Kappa Alpha. However, under 
the IFC social policy, they will 
be required to regulate their al
coholic distribution along with 
the rest of the Greek commu
nity.
The proposal was tabled at 
the end of the last semester. At 
Thursday's meeting, the IFC 
committee worked through the 
proposal, refining each term of 
the agreement. If the proposal is 
passed through the IFC, the re
sult affects all the fraternities, 
regardless of the requirements 
of each chapter's national.
According to Bareford, the na
tionals have been increasing the
pressure on each individual 
chapter steadily over the past 
year and a half. "For a while, 
Kappa DeltaRho andBeta Theta 
Pi didnt have [this pressure to 
get rid of kegs], says Bareford. 
Then their national came in 
and said, All right, youre going 
to start following this [policy]. 
Theyve gone from being opposed 
to this kind of policy, to actually 
having to follow this type of 
policy. [And] thats just indica
tive of the rest of the quad pretty 
much
If the proposal is accepted by 
the IFC, the fraternities would 
have to serve cans at forthcom
ing events. Bareford doubts that 
the change will affect the inten
sity of the fraternity parties and 
considers it to be a fluid change 
to where it wouldnt be a prob
lem.
The enforcement Bareford al
ludes to requires that fraterni
ties make detailed guest lists, 
set up a sober guard, specifi
cally to distinguish guests over 
the age of 21, as well as operate 
a working tap system in the du
ration of the social function. Oc
casionally, an IFC representa
tive would be sent in to check on 
the fraternity.
Not only would IFC be the 
watchdogs, but representatives 
from the national-level fraterni
ties would pay visits to-their 
chapters. The reason for their 
intrepid attentiveriess is that in 
past years the national fraterni
ties have taken many losses in 
the courtroom.
According to Bareford, the 
main reason for passingthe pro
posal is liability. Its a pretty 
big reason, because there have
The nationals have been coming 
down on the chapters, so every 
chapter has to follow some type of 
policy.
 IFC President Christian Bareford
been a number of houses on other 
campuses that have been sued 
for astronomical amounts, says 
Bareford.
Alcohol in fraternities, as 
stated in the IFC social policy, 
should only be distributed in ac
cordance with state, federal, and 
local laws. According to the 
policy, it is each individual 
houses responsibility to serve
alcohol based on some system of 
qualitative judgment. The IFC 
hopes that this proposal will 
forego future confrontations in 
the courtroom.
IFC is awaiting its lawyers 
appraisal of the proposal. The 
tentative voting date is Febru
ary 13, and the proposal could 
be put into effect as early as this 
semester.
1990 Yearbook completed 
and distributed to alumni
Thistle released after two years of delays
The 1990 Thistle Yearbook was 
completed last Monday and mailed 
directly to the alumni, two years 
after its scheduled release and four 
months after a Student Senate in
vestigation.
Eighteen hundred books have been 
order by The Thistle, and there are 
some still available for purchase.
The Tartan has examined a copy 
of the recently released yearbook 
and many mistakes are evident. 
These include spelling mistakes in 
headlines and layout flaws. Many of 
the photos in the book are not of high 
quality and others are printed with
out captions.
The yearbook staff of 1990 had a 
variety of charges brought to the 
attention of Student Senate by its 
ex-treasurer, senior Ross Comer.
Comers disclosure of the 
material to Senate occurred 
September 10, 1991. The 
Thistle responded to the alle
gations with a statement to Sen
ate refuting Comers allegations.
The end of this statement at
tempt to explain the reason for 
Comers disclosure as a personal 
vendetta against ex-editor alum
nus Adam Goldsmith.
I am pleased that the yearbook 
is finally out, Comer said when 
ed about the arrival of the 
book.
Senate Chair Chris Neighbor 
headed a committee which inves
tigated The Thistles actions relat
ing to the 1990 yearbook. The com
mittee has meet with The Thistle 
staff after the rebuttal to Comers 
disclosure and has helped them draft 
their constitution. Last semesters 
Student Senate treasurer began a 
complete audit of the yearbook, but
They [senate] sort of left it up to us to re
solve. No one on this staff was on the 90.1 
think they really gave us the benefit of the 
doubt.
 Kathryn Coonrod, 
Editor-in-Chief of the 1992 yearbook
the treasurer resigned and the audit 
was not completed.
Goldsmith completed the year book 
this year without the help of the 
1992 staff. The 1991 
yearbook was 
also
The Thistle
late. It was 
completed last semester.
The 1992 yearbook staff and 
the Student Senate are now able to put 
the problems of90 behind them. We 
didnt have any returning staff [exclud
ing executive board]; we had all fresh
man, editor-in-chief of the 1992 year
book Kathryn Coonrod said. They 
[Senate] sort of left it up to us to 
resolve. No one on this staff was on the 
90. I think they really gave us the 
benefit of the doubt.
Coonrod believes that with the 
completion of the 1990 yearbook more 
people will look foward to buying a 
yearbook. We should start getting 
more of a demand.
Neighbor is optimistic about the 
new Thistle staff. With a new pub
lisher this year The Thistle seems 
be moving. Theyve [The 
Thistle] made all of their dead
lines [this year], Neighbor 
said. The publisher [last 
I year] was half of the prob
lem for The Thistle
The committee has yet 
to completely end the in
vestigation. Neighbor 
admits that Senate has 
been listening for any rumors about 
the 1992 book. If for some reason the 
book is not completed, Neighbor has 
clear steps he wants to take. He says 
that if The Thistle does not come out 
on time, he will either try to disband 
the staff, or have the The Thistle cut  
down on the number of pages. The 
staff may not be able to handle the 
current page counts.

Video-conference features 
Carnegie Mellon professors
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan News Co-Editor
A live, interactive video-con
ference will be held at Robert 
Morris College and will feature 
two Carnegie Mellon professors 
and their use of writing , as an 
effective tool in science.
Writing Across the Curricu
lum will feature senior biologi
cal sciences lecturer Linda 
Kauffman, who will address her 
use of writing in junior and se
nior biology classes. According 
to Kauffman, she has worked for 
the past two years on finding out 
in what ways to apply writing
exercises to help students un
derstand science better.
Robert Morris College video
taped Kauffman and English 
doctoral student Lili Velez in a 
lecture class at CMU and will 
include the footage between live 
segments of Kauffman, Velez, 
and CMU English professor Ri
chard Young. Viewers will be 
given a chance to direct ques
tions to them by phone or fax.
Approximately 400 sites 
across the country will receive 
the broadcast over a PBS satel
lite. According to Kauffman, the 
experience should be similar to 
a regular lecture, except the
presentation is in fact a video.
Kauffmans work includes 
teaching students to summarize 
research articles and to recog
nize what types of information 
belong in an introduction to an 
article or laboratory report. 
Writing helps [students] to cre
ate information in a new way, 
said Kauffman.
The video-conference will be 
held on February 19th at 1 pm 
and is expected to last for three 
hours. It will be broadcast to the 
Hunt Library Media Classroom 
and members of the CMU com
munity are encouraged to at
tend.

Justice Thomas shows conservative side
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (DJ)  
Clarence Thomas opinion favoring 
employers over union organizers on 
Monday was his first major contribu
tion as a Supreme Court justice. But 
taken with his other opinions and votes, 
the 6-3 decision permits some prelimi
nary observations about Justice Tho
mas three months on the high court.
Thomas has allied himself with the 
courts dominant conservative bloc  
most notably by writing the labor-law 
decision and joining the majority in a
6-3 decision diminishing the protec
tion afforded minorities by the Voting 
Rights Act.
; In a separate 6-3 case, he joined the
majority in limiting the opportunities 
for asylum available to refugees from 
war-tom countries who fear being forced 
to take up arms.
It is too early for conclusive pro
nouncements about Justice Thomas 
philosophy or method, but his work 
offers hints about his inclinations. He 
has maintained a tendency toward limitingjudicial authority, which surfaced 
in his brief career on the federal ap
peals court in Washington, D.C. He 
also has shown an affinity for the views 
of the high courts most intellectually 
free-wheelingmember, Justice Antonin 
Scalia.
One question about Justice Thomas
raised by critics long before Anita Hills 
sexual harassment allegations was his 
competence: Did the judicial neophyte 
have the skills to get the job done? 
Judging from his four written opinions 
to date, the answer is yes.
His writing is workmanlike and gen
erally to the point; he has a refreshing 
aversion to footnotes. I see a justice 
who has a good deal of self-confidence, 
says Timothy Dyk, a Washington-based 
Supreme Court litigator.
In the labor-law case, Justice Tho
mas declared his allegiance to the con
servative majoritys preference for 
simple, bright-line rules, as opposed 
to the more nuanced multifactor bal
ancing tests associated with Justices 
John Stevens and Harry Blackmun.
As a rule, Justice Thomas wrote, 
employers may keep union organizers 
who arent employees off company prop
erty. He rejected more flexible posi
tions urged by the National Labor Re
lations Board and the Bush adminis
tration.
Business advocates couldnt be hap
pier. He took a very literal approach 
to the issue of property rights, notes 
Mona Zeiberg, a lawyer with the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. We were pleas
antly surprised. Though leery of draw
ing premature conclusions, Elliot 
Mincberg, legal director of the liberal
group People for the American Way, 
said he was disappointed but not sur
prised to see Justice Thomas staking 
out a position on the right.
While adjusting to his new job, Justice Thomas has impressed lawyers by 
finding the time to write a concurring 
opinion and a dissent in other cases, 
Both of these efforts share Justify 
Scalias independence of spirit and 
terseness in expression.
In his concurrence in a criminal case 
from Illinois, Justice Thomas adopted 
the Scalia approach of justifying a nar
row reading of defendants rights by 
exploring how those rights are rooted 
in U.S. history.
Darman defends Bushs 
capital gains cuts
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (DJ) 
j- White House Budget Direc
tor Richard Darman defended 
President Bushs proposed cut 
in the capital gains tax against 
charges that it primarily ben
efits the well-to-do.
During an appearance on 
Capitol Hill, Darman revived the 
trickle-down defense of Bushs 
growth package, arguing that 
lowering the top capital gains 
t^x to 15.4 pc from 28 pc would 
help the middle class by spur
ring wealthy taxpayers to in
vest and create jobs.
'Jobs, more jobs now, and more
secure and better jobs for the 
future, Darman said. It will 
create jobs right away.
The emphasis on jobs reflects 
an effort by the White House 
and congressional Republicans 
to preempt Democratic efforts 
to frame this springs capital 
gains debate on fairness 
grounds. Democrats have 
blocked every attempt to cut the 
tax since Bush made it the eco
nomic cornerstone of his 1988 
campaign.
Democrats portray it as a give
away to the richest Americans, 
a theme sounded again today by
Senate Budget Chairman James 
Sasser, (D-Tenn.), who described 
Bush as cynical for including 
the cut in his financial growth 
.package.
Its a Trojan Horse at a time 
when one in-ten-Americans are 
on foodstamps, Sasser said.
Darman, however, said he 
agreed with the supply-side 
views of Republican Senator Phil 
Gramm of Texas.
Gramm insisted lower capital 
gains taxes would induce rich 
people to go out and use their 
money to try to put people to 
work.
Cheney advises against 
dangerous Pentagon cuts
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 
(AP)  Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney said today that 
deep cuts in U.S. forces be
yond the Pentagons postCold War plan would be too 
dangerous and would under
mine the nations military ca
pability.
If we try to reduce the force 
too quickly, we can break it, 
Cheney told the Senate 
Armed Services Committee 
in his first public appearance 
since President Bush pro
posed the administrations
defense blueprint for fiscal 1993.
Responding to congressional 
charges that the military is slim
ming down too slowly since the 
disintegration of Communism, 
Cheney said plans put forth on 
Capitol Hill for deeper cuts are 
simply too steep and too dan
gerous.
If we fail to fund the training 
and high quality we have come 
to expect, we will end up with an 
organization that may still out
wardly look like a military, but 
that simply will not function, 
Cheney told the senate commit
tee.
General Colin Powell, the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, said the U.S. force, 
which will fall to 1.6 million 
by 1995 from the current lev
els of about two million, is at 
the proper level.
We view the base force as 
the right combinations of 
components and capabilities 
to be able to deter potential 
aggressors, fulfill our forward 
presence requirements, and 
respond to any crisis, Powell 
testified.
Porn review declined
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (DJ)  
The Supreme Court declined to re
view a lower-court decision uphold
ing a federal law designed to restrict 
childrens access to dial-a-porn tele
phone message services.
The federal appeals court in New 
York upheld a 1989 law requiring 
that consumers file written requests 
with the telephone company if they 
want to receive a sexually explicit 
message service. The aim of the law 
is to prevent minors from hearing 
indecent material.
Congress passed the law in re
sponse to a Supreme Court decision 
in 1989 that struck down an earlier
version ofthe anti-pornography stat
ute which categorically banned in
decent telephone message services.
Commercial dial-a-pom providers 
sued to challenge the constitution
ality ofthe revised law and a federal 
trial court blocked its enforcement.
The trial court suggested a less 
restrictive approach: requiring par
ents to request the telephone com
pany to block all their porn calls.
The federal appeals court reversed 
that decision, concluding that the 
written request procedure is more 
likely to prevent access to dial-aporn and doesnt violate the consti
tutional protection of free speech.
Foreign-aid spending will rise
First post-Cold War budget allocates additional 
funds for United Nations, former Soviet Union
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30(DJ)State 
Department and foreign aid spending 
would rise to $20.6 billion from $20.1 
billion under President Bushs first postCold War budget, which reduces secu
rity aid and increases funds for the 
UnitedNations peacekeepingforces and 
former Soviet Union.
The budget calls for $180 million in 
spending for humanitarian and techni
cal aid for the former Soviet Unions 
republics. This would be the first in
stallment of the $645 million in aid 
Bush pledged at last weeks 47-nation
conference to coordinate aid to the re
publics. A congressional aide said that 
as long as it doesnt come out of domes
tic money, I assume it will go through. 
The presidents budget would accom
plish this by essentially keeping a lid 
on total interaational-aid spending.
In addition, $350 million in spending 
is allocated for U.N. peacekeeping 
forces. Most of this money would be 
spent on peacekeeping operations in 
Cambodia and El Salvador, which both 
recently ended long and bitter civil wars 
that had been stoked by the Cold War.
Some of the funds for these programs 
would come from cuts in security assis 
tance to such nations as Pakistan and 
the Philippines, which were important 
U.S. allies in the ideological struggle 
against communism. Overall security 
assistance would decline 3 percent to 
$7.4 billion.

display Phantom Cities
CMU visiting professor Rita Myers Phantom 
Cities will be on display at The Carnegie Mu
seum of Art Forum Gallery from February 15 to 
May 3. Myers will discuss her work on February 
21 in the Museum of Art Theater.
. In Phantom Cities Myers creates a circular 
space with eight color video monitors suspended 
among dying trees and blackened wall fragments, 
which form the perimeter of the installation. In 
the center of the floor, miniature architectural 
fragments emerge from a landscape of black 
sand. Low-level blue lights and emissions from 
the video images are the only illumination, and a 
hypnotic stereo soundtrack permeates the instal
lation space.
Since 1975 Myers has had more than a dozen 
solo exhibitions of her installation and perfor
mance work throughout the country, including 
the Whitney Museum of American Art and the 
Alternative Museum, both in New York. Like

Massachusetts:
Dear Members of the Student 
Senate:
I am writing to urge your sup
port for a conditional phase-out 
of the Reserve Officers Training 
Corps (ROTC) program at Carn
egie Mellon University in 1996 
if the U.S. militarys policy of 
institutional discrimination 
against lesbians and gay men is 
not changed.
This archaic and irrational 
policy continues to be enforced 
only at a very high price. It dam
ages thousands of lives each year 
with unnecessary discharges 
from military service. The pro
cess wastes millions of tax dol
lars with no positive effect.
By exercising an on-campus 
review of the ROTC program, 
you let the Pentagon know that 
this type of discrimination can
not continueespecially at aca
demic institutions that imple
ment their own non-discrimina
tion policies. Your University can 
play a critical role in reversing 
the current ban on gays and les
bians in the military with a prin
cipled resolution on your own 
campus ROTC program. I en
courage you to support this im
portant resolution.
With kind regards.
Sincerely,
Gerry E. Studds

Senate swells with 
members-at-large

WFfiRfAeD ^HAT MON* OF IA AZ? AC-mMU1 SNATOty'
Letters to the Editor
As a percentage, whats 13 di
vided by 41? Almost 32 percent. 
And thats how much of Student 
Senate is made up of membersat-large. Members-at-large are 
appointed by the Senate as non
voting members, after they peti
tion for the position or are spon
sored by Senators. Almost one 
third of our Senate is comprised 
of members who were not voted 
in by the student body. Thats 
simply too many.
Members-at-large are able to 
sit on Senate committees, though 
they cant vote. While this keeps 
them from having official power, 
members-at-large are still able 
to influence Senate action.
Why exactly does the position 
exist? One rationale is that hav
ing members-at-large allows 
people who want to be involved 
with Senate participate without 
becoming full Senators. Why 
cant these people run for office 
like everyone else on Senate? If 
theyve tried that already and 
didnt get elected, maybe a good 
campaign would help. Not many 
noteworthy campaigns have hit 
this campus in recent memory.
It seems as if many Senators 
consider the position a consola
tion prize for those who cant be 
on Senate because they lost an 
election or for some other rea
son.
For example, Patrick Mooney 
was forced to leave Senate be
cause of a poor attendance record. 
Very soon after that, he became
Across the country, fraterni
ties are facing increasing prob
lems with liability. Our Inter
fraternity Council is conse
quently considering banning 
kegs at fraternity parties. This 
will remedy the insurance prob
lem, but other problems that 
plague fraternities on this cam
pus will remain.
Eliminating kegs will not sig
nificantly change the amount of 
alcohol consumedby party-goers, 
specifically underage partygoers. Fights, assaults, and even 
rapes happen at fraternity par
ties. Violence like this certainly 
happens at other times and in 
other places, but the availability 
of alcohol facilitates it, and there 
is lots of alcohol available at fra
ternity parties.
Fraternities have a bit of an 
image problem on campus. Many 
people believe they exist only to 
provide a place to drink and 
party. Any Greek will tell you 
this is not the case, but the per
ception persists.
Fraternity members who in
sist that reducing alcohol con
sumption in their houses would 
cause social death are feeding 
this negative perception. Theres 
much more to the fraternities 
than drinking, so why are some 
fraternity members so sure that 
serving less alcohol will nega
tively affect their houses?
True, the people who only go to 
fraternities for the alcohol wont 
think much of changes that make 
it harder to get stinking drunk, 
but the positive attitudes of fraa member-at-large.
The most disturbing part of the 
issue is that members-at-large 
are people that we, as students, 
did not vote to elect; they are 
either sponsored by Senators or 
obtain 25 signatures from their 
college on a petition. Senate then 
votes to approve them, which 
seems to be little more than a 
formality.
Student Senate is supposed to 
represent the students, who 
choose Senators by voting. There 
should not be people sitting on 
Senate who havent been chosen 
by a general vote. The fact that 
vacancies on Senate are filled by 
appointment and approval is 
another matter  in that case, 
there is little else that can be 
done.
Its good that people are inter
ested in being involved with Stu
dent Senate. Everyone has the 
opportunity to run for Senate, 
lobby Senators, and speak out 
during the audience participa
tion portion of the Senate meet
ings. Having members-at-large 
isnt necessary, and it certainly 
isnt necessary to have so many 
of them.
The undue influence membersat-large can exert is disturbing, 
considering the fact that they 
are not elected by the student 
body. Senate needs to drastically 
cut their number or eliminate 
them altogether, so that our rep
resentative body is the one weve 
chosen through our votes.
ternity members and their 
friends will help turn them 
around. If they dont, good rid
dance.
The problems that accompany 
the abuse of alcohol wont be 
solved by eliminating kegs. We 
endorse the following courses of 
action, the first two of which are 
mandated by the same proposal 
that, if passed, will ban kegs:
 Sober patrols, where a few 
brothers dont drink and patrol 
the party to prevent fights and 
other trouble, make parties safer. 
Theres nothing like a rational, 
sober person to defuse a poten
tially dangerous situation.
 Carding guests and marking 
them so those who are underage 
arent served is both responsible 
and legal.
 All fraternities are required 
to make soft drinks available at 
parties, but youd never know 
there was soda from what you 
see around you. There should be 
more encouragement to drink 
soda instead of beer, especially 
later in the evening, when many 
guests would be better off drink
ing soda anyway.
 Guests who are obviously 
drunk shouldnt be served. This 
eliminates the potential for alco
hol poisoning and reduces the 
possibility of drunken injury or 
violence.
Its not the presence of kegs, 
but the institutionalized drinkingthat exists in fraternities that 
really causes problems. IFCs 
proposal is a step in the right 
direction, but it isnt enough.
Senate protests news 
story as one-sided
Editor:
In your article of 
January 27, [Senate 
petition forces ROTC 
referendum, 1/27], 
you present Mr.
Mooneys claim that, Senate members 
... are using inefficient methods to verify 
signatures. You also quote Mr. Mooney 
as saying, Student Senate seems to be 
doing anything they can to slow things 
down.
Both of Mr. Mooneys accusations are 
pure opinion, and yet you published 
them in an article. You made no at
tempt to substantiate them, if you had 
you would have found both were false. 
You did not print rebuttals to balance 
the accusations; you apparently did not 
even solicit rebuttals.
In presenting these claims without 
rebuttals, you represented specious al
legations as fact, in the style of super
market tabloids. Please act to rectify 
this mistake, if only to salvage the 
credibility of your news department. 
Please also follow a more responsible 
course in the future.

Definition of harassment 
not met by Jefferson posts
Editor:
Eric Jeffersons 
posts to the Womens 
Center bboard do tell 
an interesting story.
We see a man who is 
vulgur, rude, obnoxious, and yes, even 
sexist. But, he has not met any of the 
criteria for sexual harassment.
Using the University policy as a guide, 
he has not made unwelcome sexual 
advances, nor requested sexual favors, 
nor has he initiated physical contact. 
His medium of choice by its very na
ture makes it impossible to create an 
intimidating, hostile, or offensive work 
environment because people must go 
out of their way and make the decision 
to see it.
The electronic bboard is such that 
those wishing to avoid Mr. Jeffersons 
opinions may do so with the touch of a 
key without any risk of being exposed 
to that which may offend them.
The possible choices, when faced with 
such as Mr. Jefferson presents, are to 
either respond to it or ignore it. Unfor
tunately Messrs. Masco, Newman, and 
Knauer have taken a third route: use of 
authority to punish and to silence.
I ask the campus community: Would 
you rather make your own choices on 
what you wish to see or not see, or 
would you rather have someone else 
acting for your own good on your be
half? Someone like Mr. Knauer who in 
an email letter to Jefferson said, Heed 
my warning, I assure you that I can 
make life quite difficult for you on this 
campus.... You are being watched, re
member that.
At the very least, Eric Jefferson will 
be put through a great inconvenience; 
at the worst he will be expelled. I ask 
those in power to allow us to make the 
choice to ignore Jeffersons obscenity, 
and not to belittle the important and
necessary policy on Sexual Harassment 
by applying it to this case.

No harassment by Jeffer
son, says student
Editor:
I have read and 
archived all 16 of Eric 
Jeffersons messages 
on assoc.womenscenter. While I agree 
that they are both rude and in poor 
taste, there is nothing in any one of the 
messages that is not protected under 
current interpretations of the first 
amendment, or that should be inter
preted as sexual harassment.
The Eric Jefferson situation has con
fused two complicated issues, both 
which must be considered before pass
ing judgment. The first is whether or 
not what Jefferson said was in fact 
sexual harassment or just political 
speech. As no personal references are 
made, Jeffersons comments about 
women and lesbians are purely politi
cal, and not harassment at all. You may 
not like what he says, but why not 
respond intelligently and try to edu
cate him instead trying to have him 
punished?
The second issue is the nature of the 
medium Jefferson used to communi
cate his ideas. Your editorial warns 
Email harassment threatens us all. 
However, Jefferson was not using email, 
he was using bboards, and there is an 
important difference. No one forces 
anyone to read a bboard, and while 
sending a message to a personal email 
account could be perceived as harass
ment, talking on an open forum where 
members participate or leave as they 
wish, cannot. If I voluntarily walked 
into a room where a neo-Nazi group 
was meeting, could I claim harassment?
If, however, the administration or 
individuals still feel Jeffersons com
ments are so inappropriate that they 
warrant punishment, then they should 
be aware of court rulings on similar 
politically correct speech codes. In a 
recent case against University of Wis
consin, a federal court held that such 
speech codes are unconstitutional, as 
they violate the free speech clause of 
the first amendment (UVM Post vs. 
Board of Regents of the University Of 
Wisconsin System, 1991).
As Carnegie Mellon is a private uni
versity, it is not subject to the first 
amendment, but dont you think we 
should enjoy the same privileges of free 
speech as students at Pitt or Penn State? 
I was particularly distressed to see our 
student paper, which is supposed to be 
the voice of the student body, favor 
censorship as a means to resolving prob
lems instead of open speech and discus
sion.
If such infringements on free speech 
occur in the infant stages of the bboard 
system, and in news media as a whole, 
then the possibilities and benefits of 
electronic communications may never 
be realized.
If you feel you have had your rights in 
any way infringed as a result of your 
use of the Andrew system, or if you will 
like the complete text of Jeffersons 
posts or related legal decisions, please
contact me at ag3j@andrew.cmu. edu. 
In addition, I encourage anyone inter
ested in Eric Jeffersons case to read 
the netnews.alt.comp.acad-freedom.news bboard.

Editor:
I am extremely dis
appointed in your 
coverage of the Eric LGtt6f tO 
Jefferson issue [Sex- .. Erl"-* 
ual Harassment, 1/ tultOt'
27]. You quote from his November 16 
post, I think that the biggest Nazis in 
the country today... are feminists, and 
imply that this is what got the womens 
center and the administration angry at 
Mr. Jefferson.
If you had actually read the posting, 
you would have noticed these quotes as 
well: .. .not wanting to deal with all you 
fugly sexually frustrated women...., I 
went to this so-called talk of the bitch 
whose name is [above]...., ...you are 
restricting speech in the workplace be
cause a few frustrated cunts who mas
turbate every night...., ...those 
motherfucking pussy wimps that came 
to that Simonton debate, and You 
bitches have always tried to cut my 
balls off and I dont appreciate it.
Now I want to make it clear that I do 
not support censorship, and do not think 
formal action should be taken in this 
case. But your article implied that mere 
disagreement with the Womens Cen
ter was enough to bring a formal accu
sation of sexual harrassment, and that 
is not true.
If you had included any one of the 
above quotes in your article, I think the 
campus would have had a much clearer 
picture of what Jefferson had done to 
arouse the irrational (but completely 
understandable) rage of those who ac
cuse him. What was the most sickening 
was your unchallanged quoting of 
Jefferson : I do not think I was offen
sive. (I am being charitable in only 
accusing you of sloppy, rather than 
biased, reporting.)

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 February 19927
Is turning 21 really worth the wait?
Jason McDonald
Ah, to be 21! When your bod
ies start changing and you start 
noticing members of the oppo
site sex. When ...
Wait a second. Thats the 
speech for age 12. Lets try this 
again.
Ah, to be 21  the high holy 
landmark of college students. 
The age at which you can go to 
the local tavern and proudly say, 
Barkeep, bring me a pint of 
your best! (Yes, most people 
stopped doing this sometime in 
the Middle Ages, but you still 
have every legal right to try this.) 
Its also the age at which you can 
go into PHI as yourself. There 
are, in theory, other advantages, 
but most of them revolve around 
drinking, so well stick to that 
topic.
I would preface this with a full
disclaimer to the effect that Im 
not condoning underage drink
ing, but come on now. Youre all 
adults, and if youre really look
ing to me to guide your actions, 
you need serious help. However, 
for the sake of subpoena-dodg
ing,. dont drink if youre under 
21. Boy, dont I just drip with 
concern and integrity?
Anyway, on to more impor
tant things. The tragic fact of 
life is that, on a purely alcoholic 
level, the hunt for 21 is usually 
more interesting than the at
tainment of that goal.
Once youre there, not only is 
there nothing to look forward to, 
but the act of drinking reduces 
to a tiresome chore. A merit 
badge to go with the station, so 
to speak.
All you of-agers think about it. 
What happens when you tell 
someone you dont want to go 
out to a bar on Friday night? 
Shocked looks and forced clenchteethed utterances of Itll be 
fun, though! are the first salvo;
character assassination is the 
result of further refusal. Ive 
gotten my share of this crap, 
and I cant pretend I havent 
given it a few times.
It all comes back to the twisted 
importance college society at
taches to drinking.
Im not trying to be the Carn
egie Mellon Boy Scout Extra
ordinaire, or even saying that 
drinking is bad. There are 
enough stories (and photo
graphic evidence) floating 
around to nail me if I try to climb 
on that proverbial high horse. 
Im just pointing out that once 
youre there, being 21 isnt the 
end-of-all-things experience that 
its hyped as.
The celebration may very well 
be a blast (ask me the story of 
my 21st some time), but that 
depends on the planning capa
bilities of the friends you go out 
with. Then again, any birthday 
can be good if its done right. Its 
the aftermath that really turns 
out to be the letdown. Being 21
is just like being 20, only you 
dont have to try the I-leffc-it-athome-will-you-take-my-collegeID defense against bouncers.
Why the j aded attitude toward 
the mania? First of all, I know 
too many underage people for 
my own 21-ness to be worth
while. The gap is steadily clos
ing, but right now its not always 
worth the trouble. The ego rush 
of being the only of-ager on the 
block fades pretty fast, and the 
rubbing-in gets stale.
Next, I think theres a bit of 
the subconscious at work here. I 
think the defying-the-law mys
tique of underage drinking is a 
lot of the activitys appeal (aside 
from the dizziness and loss of 
feeling in the extremities). In 
the same way Americans like 
driving 70 miles per hour, skim
ming on taxes, ripping tags off 
mattresses, and watching really 
bad R-rated skin films when no 
ones looking, we like thumbing 
our noses at the LCB. Having 
that underage beer brings out
the James Dean in all of us, and 
taking away the stigma takes 
away the fun.
Lastly, and most importantly, 
its expensive  far be it from 
me to live by the ringing of cash 
registers, butits a concern. Part 
of this goes back to my trouble
some predilection for import 
beer, but Ive blown $20 in an 
evening without climbing the 
quality ladder any higher than 
Rolling Rock. My wallet cant 
really handle too many of those 
binges, to say nothing of what it 
does to my head.
I guess Ill wrap up with a 
final word to the underage. You 
too will eventually be 21, so quit 
marking off the calendar. Other 
than the convenience, theres 
little to get in a frenzy about.
And no, I wont buy for you.

Laundry terrifies hapless 
and unsuspecting student
* Abby Schiff
Im becoming convinced that 
crabbiness is seasonal. Last weeks arc
tic conditions left me confined to my 
dorm room, pondering the injustices of 
life; after three agonizing days of re
peated trips to the junk food machines 
and the TV cubicle, I realized that my 
list of gripes about Carnegie Mellon is 
not only long, but ever-growing.
Theres the weather, of course. And, 
the teachers who continually keep my 
classes five or ten minutes late, forcing 
me to run across campus only to sit on 
the floor of an overpacked room for fifty 
minutes. Lets not forget those people 
who insist on singing aloud sweet, cheer
ful melodies when theyre nineteenth 
and Im eighteenth in line for the lone 
cashier at Salads Plus. But far and 
away my biggest, fattest gripe about 
CMU is (menacing voice): laundry.
Laundry? an innocent bystander 
might inquire. Yes, laundry. Theres no 
good reason why tossing some soap and 
a few pairs of jeans into a washing
machine should evoke the teeth-gnashing fury that it invariably does here at 
CMU, but unfortunately this is the case.
Id guess that anyone who hasnt ex
perienced at least one instance of lost 
money, time, or sanity in CMUs laun
dry facilities probably subscribes to the 
ever-popular wear-once-throw-awaybuy-more method of obtaining clean 
clothes. For the remainder of the oncampus student body, the laundry is a 
force to be reckoned with.
To begin with, doing laundry is an oftpostponed activity. Personally, its my 
second-most-procrastinated chore. (My 
most-procrastinated chore, incidentally, 
is cleaning out the space under my bed; 
its been so long since Ive done it that 
Im afraid to make an attempt; strange 
noises emanating from what Id thought 
was an empty potato chip bag down 
there confirmed this fear last October.) 
At any rate, this postponement usually 
means that by the time I venture down 
into the bowels of Morewood D-Tower 
with my sack of dirty clothes, Ive got a 
lot of laundry. And, this doesnt make 
finding enough operational machines 
any easier.

unfamiliar with the dire shortage of

Campus needs drastic 
overhaul of facilities
 Inhn FmJohn Funge
Have you ever been looking around 
campus when, for the tenth time, it 
suddenly dawns on you how incredibly 
run-down so many of the buildings and 
facilities are? I mean really, how much 
would it take for someone to slop a coat 
of paint onto the racquetball courts, or to 
deodorize Skibo? Whats with such a 
prestigious university resorting to 
trailers for extra office space? Why can 
our fraternity quad pass for a low-income housing development? Why is it so 
easy to come up with questions like 
these?
The principle cause that I see for many 
of the maintenance problems on cam
pus, besides the fact that Physical Plant 
is lazy and inept, is that CMU is going 
through a period of major change. Not 
just some piddling additions; the very 
heart of the University is being reno
vated and restructured. Of course, once 
the proposed improvements are com
pleted, such as the University Center, 
CMU should shine. Maybe. However, in
the meantime, were left with dirty car
pets, chipped paint, cracked concrete, 
and dimwits who seem to have forgotten 
about the present in anticipation of the 
future. As a result, in terms of the havea-nice-day, make-me-at-least-feel-likeTm-getting-half-my-mone/s-worth-type 
facilities, CMU is at an all-time low. In 
fact, this is probably one of the worst 
possible times in CMUs history to be 
here.
We are at the end of an era. It, unfortu
nately, seems that construction at CMU 
occurred in spurts  the original build
ings, the hellish Skibo, Scaife, and 
Donner-type buildings. As a result, ev
erything is going downhill at once, and 
yeah, were here to witness it. Yet, what 
is CMU to do? If facilities are soon to be 
replaced, it only makes sense not to put 
good money after bad in renovating the 
old. Ah, but soon is the key word in that 
sentence. When is soon? The answer to 
this question largely determines how 
much effort should be put into maintain
ing current facilities. But due to post
ponements after postponements, this 
soon thing keeps changing. As a result, 
half-decent renovations that could last 
until the bigger improvements are made 
get continually passed over for costly 
patchwork upkeep.

Sexual harassment charge results in censorship
Chris Restifo
Im going to write a letter. Im 
going to write a letter to the 
editor of a major newspaper like 
The New York Times. Im going 
to write that I believe that blacks 
are the cause of all crime, that 
gays are destroying the moral 
fiber of America, and that women 
should all be barefoot, pregnant, 
and in the kitchen.
Let us suppose that the letter
(for some odd, unexplainable 
reason) will be printed. Many, 
many people will read it. After 
reading my obviously bigoted, 
sexist, racist opinions, they are 
going to become angry and write 
letters back. They will argue that 
what I said was wrong, evil, dis
gusting, and a host of other 
things. Does this sound like ev
eryday activity where people 
exercise their rights to speak 
out? Of course, it does.
But, at CMU, things are much, 
much different.
Of course, I would never write 
such a thing. I dont believe one 
word of my hypothetical letter.
But here on the Andrew bulletin 
board system, Eric Jefferson 
posted some statements that 
could be considered on the same 
level of bigotry and ignorance. A 
few rational people chose to ig
nore himorrespond to him. Some 
others attempted to silence him 
by threatening him with sexual 
harassment charges.
By now, most people know the 
jist of what happened on the 
assocs.womens-center bboard. 
Jefferson posted some things 
that were rather hateful and 
spiteful. Joshua Knauer, Todd 
Masco, and Chris Newman de
cided that they were being harassed and were going to do 
something about it.
Those who dont peruse the 
bboards, however, dont know 
about Knauers attitude and ig
norance. In a very personal, 
threatening email letter, Knauer 
warned Jefferson that if he ever 
again posted anything profane 
or disgusting to the womens 
center bboard, Knauer could see 
to it that his account was taken 
away and that he would possi
bly be arrested for assault. If 
you dont believe me, read the 
message.
After Jefferson made the mes
sage public, Knauer said that
Jefferson had selectively edited 
the message to distort its mean
ing. When I proposed that the 
entire message should be posted 
for all to see, I got a message 
from Knauer that we should just 
let the thing drop. It was later 
discovered that Jefferson did 
indeed forward the whole mesJefferson then made some 
more posts that were intended 
solely to upset people, because 
someone called his post offen
sive and threatened to take ac
tion against him. After some 
more flaming, Knauer started

well, acknowledging the fact that 
some people value Kings birth
day is not enough. The article 
seemed to say, Hey, Im not 
black and I dont care one way or 
the other about Kings birthday, 
but I realize that it means a lot 
to some people  isnt that 
enough?
Well no, it isnt. If a person 
does nothing to promote racial 
harmony as McDonald called 
it, s/hes obviously satisfied with 
the status quo, and supportive 
f the so-called society where 
bigotry is tolerated and a source 
f entertainment.
I didnt appreciate the lack of 
research given to an article sup
porting (at least in theory) Mar
tin Luther King Jr.s birthday. 
Racism comes in many forms, 
I believe ambivalence is one
of them. King fought for civil 
rights and world peace.
He opened many doors for 
blacks, yet we still forget his 
main messageto have a world 
where people dont see each other 
in terms of colors and races, but 
as human beings.
It is sad that we only give one 
day out of the year to remember 
this.

Senior, Technical Writing
Student agrees that 
TV show lacks fire
onEditor:
Thank you 
Chris Restifo 
for bringing to Letter to 
print a long Edj*or
harboredsen- lne CUIlUr
timent. Star Trek: The Next Gen
eration is no substitute for the 
long-gone series from 1966. But 
I would like to point out that 
there is more to the picture than 
just the contemporary series 
being less exciting. The Next 
Generation lacks the nuts to be 
science-fiction.
The original Star Trek only 
lasted three seasons on the air. 
It was cut largely because of the 
same perception that prevented 
the pilot episode from being 
aired. The reason? The produc
ers felt it was too cerebral; 
that it wouldnt be appreciated 
by the TV audience.
NBC was besieged with let
ters when they canceled the 
show. Perhaps the TV audience 
wasnt so inert after all.
But The Next Generation, now 
beyond its seventh season, con
tinually focuses on the melodra
matic instead of the bizarre; 
someone doesnt want to grow 
old, Picard has a skeleton in his 
closet, Wesley is starting to like 
girls.
These plots have nothing to do 
with the setting; the Enterprise 
might as well be the Love Boat 
where the little lessons of life 
teach us oh-so-much.
Like the stories, characters in 
The Next Generation are stag
nant. In the old series, we 
learned over time what mettle 
our heroes were made of, but 
The Next Generation was set 
from episode one.
The creators of this series 
seemed interested in recreating 
Star Trek to conform to the 80s, 
a time where child-psychologists 
told us that Bugs Bunny was too 
violent and Saturday morning
cartoons decayed into smurfs 
and all-morning news. There is 
no danger, no tension; every
thing stays politically correct.
I still watch The Next Genera
tion, hoping that something cool 
might slip through, but all the 
efforts of Industrial Light and 
Magic cannot make a singing 
Worf appear anything but silly. 
You see, I grew up with hippies, 
Mustangs, Apollo missions, and 
Star Trek. I thought anything 
was possible if you tried hard 
enough.
The Next Generation reflects 
this, providing an Orwellian 
narcotic for a country without a 
goal. The Wimp Generation, Mr. 
Restifo? No, I would call it Star 
Trek: The Reagan Generation.

8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 February 1992
Laundry causes consternation
LAUNDRY, from page 7
functioning machines and the 
probability of an unused ma
chine being token-eating in na
ture might again wonder: ex
actly what is the cause of the 
laundry-doers misery?
As anyone who has ever 
jammed token after token into 
these money-gobbling machines 
knows, its not really a question 
of losing cash  after all, re
funds are available  but the 
exasperation of being unable to 
clean a load of clothes in under 
four, attempts.
The chance of getting a steady 
stream of water, proper rinsing, 
and a spin dry on the first try is 
quite slim indeed.
Watching someone try to start 
a machine is, in fact, somewhat 
similar to viewing the rows of 
slot machines and gamblers in a 
Vegas casino: a glimmer of hope 
in the launderers eye as he or 
she pushes the lever, followed 
by the radiant grin of someone 
who has hit the jackpot or, more 
commonly, disappointment, in 
the case of the luckless gambler
 along with the resolve to try 
for the gold once more.
The washing machines can be 
infuriating, but even they can
not compare with the cunning of 
the loathsome devices that pose 
as dryers in Morewoods steamy 
basement.
As though peeling thick pads 
of other peoples lint out of the 
lint screens isnt unpleasant
enough, using these dryers is a 
constant source of embarrass
ment and frustration to the laundry-room crowd.
As with the washing machines, 
frustration stems from the fact 
that at any given time, exactly 
two dryers are operational 
(meaning that a normal-sized 
load of clothes will become only 
slightly damp in just under two 
hours).
These two dryers move eva
sively among the broken ones, 
switching places so I never know
on top of my dryer, brandishing 
an Uzi, some other ambitious 
launderer will invariably pounce 
on it the minute it grinds to a 
halt.
Sometimes, I find that my 
clothes have been taken out and 
piled neatly. More often, how
ever, and always on the same 
afternoon that I trip over a crack 
in the sidewalk and fall while at 
least a hundred people are stand
ing around watching, my laun
dry  clean and dry at last!is 
flung carelessly around the
laundry room.
Going through my basic laun
dry ritual here typically takes 
over two hours: trying the ma
chines, cursing, dragging sop
ping-wet clothes up to my room 
and draping them all over the 
place to dry. (This last element 
can result in an interesting dorm 
room decor, particularly when 
socks come into the picture.)
At a school where time is pre
cious and the stress is intense to 
the point of making the fivesecond WALK signal at
Watching someone try to start a machine is, in fact, 
somewhat similar to viewing the rows of slot machines 
and gamblers in a Vegas casino: a glimmer of hope in 
the launderers eye as he or she pushes the lever, fol
lowed by the radiant grin....
whether or not mine is function
ing, until I come down forty min
utes after placing my clothes in, 
only to find a soggy heap, si
lently mocking me.
The emotional toll of all this, 
particularly when Im all psych
ed up for a warm, fluffy armful 
of clean clothes, can be devas
tating.
The dryer shortage can invoke 
even more emotional trauma 
through its capacity of embar
rassing laundry-doers. Unless I 
actually sit in the laundry room
room. Usually, my tom under
wear  the pair with the name 
tag from summer camp still 
stitched into itis right smack 
dab at the top of the heap, April 
fresh.
In all fairness, doing laundry 
is never a favorite activity no 
matter where its done. Broken 
machines, lint balls the size of 
grapefruit, and fierce competi
tion for dryers all basically come 
with the territory.
But I cannot forgive CMU for 
all my wasted time spent in the
Morewood and Forbes a heart 
attack-inducing endeavor, two 
hours wasted on a little thing 
like having clean underwear for 
the next week is practically sin
ful.
I can only keep hoping that 
Carnegie Mellon University 
moves my World History lecture 
into the laundry room twice a 
month so the hours I spend there 
wont be completely idle.

CMU, from page 7
Ironically, though, I would 
prefer it if construction were 
put off until Im out of here. The 
whole situation gets worse when 
construction is under way.
While a building is being built, 
theres a big mud pile in place of 
the dilapidated facility.
Sure, Skibo might be a stink
ing heap, but imagine what its 
going to be like without it while 
the University Center is being 
erected.
One does not have to look back 
far to remember how the con
struction of the new stadium 
disrupted normal campus life. 
Put bluntly, a campus under 
major construction should be 
shied away from. Now, I figure 
that out.
Unfortunately, the worn-out 
shape of facilities is certainly 
not limited just to Skibo and the
gymAs a result, its going to take a 
lot more than the University 
Center to spruce up CMU. For
instance, compare Hamburg 
Hall with Doherty Hall. These 
buildings are very similar, ex
cept Hamburg is reasonably nice 
while Doherty is a dungeon. 
Why?
With places like the faculty 
locker room and the Adamson 
Wing, CMU has proven that it 
can make itself presentable, but 
why only in certain areas which 
usually benefit faculty or gradu
ate students? Money?
Well then, how can schools 
with comparable tuition, smaller 
enrollments, and larger cam
puses (namely, Colgate and 
Hamilton, which Ive seen first 
hand) sport glamorously wellkept facilities?
For one, schools like Colgate 
and Hamilton dont have a glut 
of esoteric computer hardware. 
Its almost like CMU at some 
point or another decided that it 
would lead the world in comput
ers, at any expense.
So what does CMU do? It puts 
all its eggs in its little computer
basket, so that we can compete 
with much better endowed 
places like MIT and Stanford.
CMU might have more money 
from alumni contributions to buy 
computers and take care of its 
buildings if it did a better job of 
satisfying its students.
And one of the first steps in 
satisfying its students is to as
sure a pleasing, not dreary, cam
pus.
In other words, pawn off a few 
of the extra work stations and 
get a new piano for Donner, fix 
up the weight room, put some 
lights in Doherty, and paint the 
window moldings in Hamerschlag Hall.
Now, I may be a fool, but Im 
not blind. I do recognize that 
CMU is trying.
We do, after all, have the newly 
completed east campus project. 
However, even the upkeep on 
the new facilities seems some
what lax.
It would be a shame if these 
new dorms were to die prematurely, like Skibo, due to cheap 
construction and weak mainte
nance. As everyone knows, once 
something starts to look beaten 
up, people start treating it with 
less respect.
The shabby condition of many 
of CMUs facilities is inexcus
able. CMU should try a little 
harder at doing some fixing up. 
Construction schedules should 
be realistic, and students should 
get first rate temporary facili
ties.
For CMU owes it to its current 
students to give them the same 
quality facilities that were and 
will be enjoyed by past and fu
ture students.
But right now, all I see is a 
campus that has a bad case of 
five oclock shadow.

Charge questioned
CHARGE, from page 7
flinging the terms slander and 
libel around, obviously igno
rant of the legal definitions. 
For example, Jefferson said 
that Knauer picked the mag
gots out of his mothers cunt. 
Knauer incorrectly called this 
slander instead of libel, and he 
failed to realize that under the 
law, remarks like this are so 
outrageous that no one would 
believe them. Slander and libel 
have to damage a reputation.
The letter to Murphy and the 
bboard activity all relate to the 
fact that some people, like 
Knauer, consider Jeffersons 
post harassment. Here is a 
simple solution to this prob
lem: Dont read the message. If 
you do, and you start to become 
offended, skip the rest of the 
message. If you start to read 
something in The Tartan, and 
it begins to offend you, put the 
damn thing down. Dont try to 
drag the entire paper into 
Murphys office because it was 
harassing you.
It is truly frightening that 
there are people who will abuse 
a public forum because they 
didnt like what was said. As 
one of my colleagues said, the 
message sent by Knauer and 
his method are far, far more 
harassing than anything 
Jefferson could have ever 
posted. Why? Its free speech to 
scream and yell at someone for 
his or her viewpoint. Its fas
cism and totalitarianism to use 
a vague university definition 
of harassment to silence some
one. Many people probably feel 
that this free speech garbage is 
totally irrelevant, since Andrew 
is a private bboard system. In 
other cases, the Supreme Court 
ruled that such private sys
tems are outside the bounds of 
the Constitution.
CMU, however, strives for 
the free exchange of ideas. Stu
dents have the right to hear 
people speak, as long as they 
dont interfere with the safety 
and operation of the Univer
sity. Now when CMU claims to 
promote the exchange of ideas, 
that principle must include all 
ideas and beliefs, no matter 
how offensive they may be to 
others. It is extremely hypo
critical for the administration 
even to consider banning cer
tain ideas or types of speech on 
the bboards when they are not 
even close to harassment.
The tactics used by Knauer, 
New-man, and Masco actually 
help to undermine the sexual 
harassment policy here at 
CMU. If Jefferson had sent per
sonal email to people, sent 
them actual mail, personally 
confronted them, assaulted 
them, or did anything that 
made avoiding his ideas diffi
cult, such as saying or posting 
them in a workplace, then ha
rassment would be justified. 
Childish tactics like this ha
rassment charge do nothing 
more than make it apparent 
that the administration is out 
to cater to anyone who whines 
that he or she is upset about 
something. How long do we 
have before the administration 
and campus body become tired 
of squabbles like these and 
begin to ignore cases with real 
potential for sexual harass
ment?
Already, people who use An
drew are seriously question
ing the method used against 
Jefferson. Instead of letting the 
community of email users 
handle the situation in the 
manner they saw fit, which 
happened to be just ignoring 
Jefferson or arguing with him, 
Knauer and his associates saw 
to it that they were made the 
conscience of the bboards. I 
will admit that I once created a 
series of bboards that may have 
been considered offensive. 
Someone took issue with it, 
spoke to me personally, and I 
apologized. No administration 
had to be brought in.
Some rationality still exists 
among those who signed the 
letter. Masco and Newman 
have both stated that they 
would not have approved of 
taking disciplinary action 
against Jefferson. Although I 
applaud this concern that Big 
Brother not be brought in, I 
still question the method. 
Knauer said that Jefferson 
should deal with the rule 
whether it is right or wrong. 
With this type of attitude be
hind the letter, its hard not to 
see this incident as someone 
attempting to silence another 
solely because he or she doesnt 
like what the other says.
The idea of a diverse com
munity with people who har
bor mutual respect for each 
other may give us all a warm 
feeling inside. Unless the per
son posting makes actual 
threats, or commits real sexual 
harassment, there is no ex
cuse whatsoever for this type 
of behavior. I dont know about 
you, but the only feeling Im 
getting inside right now is one 
of fear.

Women burn Brandis 59-45
Iron Mike 
faces his 
toughest 
opponent
Am I the only one who thinks 
Indiana vs. Tyson doesnt ex
actly have the ring of ground
breaking legal precedent? And 
yet ground is being broken  
we have the first rape trial in 
history (or at least the first Ive 
ever heard of) to be documented 
by the sports reporters of the 
national media.
My initial reaction was a con
cern for what this says about 
our society. Charley Steiner talk
ing about the jury selection pro
cess? The guy cant even get base
ball players names right. And 
thats the high end of the spec
trum; I shudder to think of what 
this weeks Fedko Zone looked 
like.
Theres something more im
portant thats wrong here, 
though. I get the uneasy feeling 
that weve got Iron Mike con
victed before the fact. Not that 
Ive ever been a Mike Tyson or a 
boxing fan, but I fear Mike may 
get steamrolled by the Ameri
can legal process simply based 
on his star value and his line of 
work.
Assuming that humor is agood 
barometer of public opinion, the 
world has it fixed in its collective 
mind that Tyson did it. And why 
not? Past history makes him an 
easy target, so why not take the 
path of least resistance and think 
him guilty?
You want a history of violence? 
Take a look at the video tape 
from the Marvis Frazier fight. 
Think back to the late-night 
shindig with Mitch Green a few 
years ago. For that matter, how 
many times have you heard the 
name Robin Givens pop up in 
connection with this trial? This 
part of the prosecutions job 
should be like shooting fish in a 
barrel.
But if thats all they have, rea
sonable doubt is still out there. 
A my-word-against-your-word, 
which is what this case was, last 
time I looked, should be a tailormade defense verdict unless they 
bring Perry Mason in to crossexamine. Then, of course, some
one else would admit to the 
crime, but thats beside the point.
So, barring some form of sur
prise witness or testimony (ob
viously I dont sit in on the 
prosecutions planning sessions), 
tyson should be free in a few 
weeks. It worked for William 
Kennedy Smith; why not Tyson, 
right? Wrong.
Remember that the Twelve 
Nappy Hoosiers will be bom
barded with reminders of what 
a violent guy Tyson is. Remem
ber that theyll be deliberating 
and that Tyson joke will pop into 
their heads. Remember that 
sme of those jurors may be 
caught up on the idea of controljjng the fate of a celebrity of 
hysons magnitude.
As for me, Ill wait and see. 
Inere may be some smoking 
evidence around the corner, in which case I hope Tyson 
Sets what he deserves. For right 
nw, though, its innocent until 
Proven guilty in my book. It may 
be the popular thing to do, 
ut I wish Tyson the best of luck, 
get the feeling hes going to need it.

Dont let the final score fool 
you. Yesterdays 5^-45 womens 
basketball win over Brandeis 
University wasnt quite the run
away the 14-point victory mar
gin would indicate. It was, how
ever, another step toward re
peating as University Athletic 
Association champs, as the Tar
tans rolled to a 8-1 UAA mark.
I was a little worried about 
our offensive flow, said head 
coach Gerri Seidl. We made a 
lot of our own mistakes, rather 
than anything they were doing 
to us.
Luckily, the Judges were un
able to cash in on enough of 
those mistakes, due mostly to 
ice-cold shooting. Brandeis shot 
a measly .271 for the game (16 
for 59), including a .226 firsthalf pace. The Judges didnt put 
their first points on the board 
until six and a half minutes had 
passed, but early fouls and turn
overs kept the Tartans from 
pulling away early.
With six minutes remaining 
in the half, the Tartans made 
their first break for daylight with 
a nine-point run. The fourminute dominance gave the Tar
tans a 27-12 lead as the twominute mark approached. The 
Judges were able to put together 
a small run of their own late in 
the period, but they went to the 
half trailing 29-18.
Coming in, our main goal was 
to shut down their inside game, 
said Seidl. I felt they had a 
more dominant inside game, so 
we played a zone to try and con
trol the inside.
Early in the second half, the 
Tartans received their first scare 
ofthegameas the Judges rattled 
off seven straight points, and 
fouls were beginning to pile up. 
Seven minutes into the second 
half, the forward corps was 
riddled with foulssenior Amy 
Buxbaum had four fouls, and 
sophomore Jeanine Megahan 
and freshman Meredith McKnight had three apiece.
The fouls themselves didnt 
worry me because we were. ; 
healthy, said Seidl. If we lost <-j 
one player to fouls, we still had, ; 
others to pick up the si ack. What -. 
did concern me was putting them,.  
on the line. We basically allowed 
them back in the game by put--, 
ting them on the line.
Things got worse before they; 
got better as the Judges rallied : 
to within three points, 37-34,t 
with 9:24 to play, and Megahan . 
picked up her fourth personal 
foul. Luckily, the foul by. 
Megahan would be the last bump, . 
in the road for the Tartans.
The last eight minutes were/, 
all Carnegie Mellon. With 
Brandis key player, center  
Racheal Perry, sitting with four; 
fouls, the Tartans cleaned house;. 
with a 161 run over the ensu- . 
ing six minutes. By the time the.,,, 
Judges scored again, they trailed 
by a game-high 19 points, 57- 
38. Brandeis managed to whittlea few points off the Tartan lead 
in the final minutes, but the_ 
Tartans came away with the 59.

Judges overtake Tartans in final minutes
By LUBOMIR K OCHAN SKYJ
Tartan Junior Staff writer
For the second consecutive game, the 
CMU mens basketball team lost a game 
in the last two minutes. Yesterdays 
9187 loss to the Brandeis University 
Judges was especially disheartening 
considering that CMU had led by as 
much as 19 points. We havent played 
with many leads this season, said de
jected head coach Tony Wingen. We 
need more experience doing it.
The first eight minutes of the half 
were evenly played, but the Judges 
were scoring uncontested baskets. 
Wingen called time-out to regroup de
fensively, and the result was a very 
aggressive man-to-man and full-court 
press defense which ignited their of
fense, outscoring the Judges to take a 
57-42 halftime lead. Shooting 66 per
cent from the field, CMU was led by 
three players in double figures, sopho
mores Derek Dragisich (12 points), Rony 
Johns (11 points), and Mike Hosni (10 
points).
Things kept getting better as CMU 
built its lead to 19 points with a basket 
by sophomore forward Charlie Connors 
at the 13-minute mark of the second 
half.
Brandeis then went on a 11-3 run
thanks to three three-pointers and a 
couple of CMU turnovers. We got away 
from out game plan, and started rush
ing our shots, said Wingen.
It looked like the Tartans would fend 
off this run, buildingthe score up to 80 
65 on a Dragisich basket, but with six 
and a half minutes left in the game, the 
momentum swung in Brandis favor. 
Their intensity soared, resulting in 
steals and second and third shots at the 
basket, which enabled them to go on a 
267 run. Three more three-pointers, 
clutch free-throw shooting, and a suffo
cating defense was the key to this run.
In the last 12 minutes of the game, 
we were not playing to win, just to hang 
on, said Wingen. Brandeis had more 
intensity and we just didnt respond.
Hosni and Dragisich finished the 
game with 16 points, Connors scored 13 
points, and Johns and junior guard 
Todd Jenkins with 11 points each.
Brandeis was led by seniors Steve 
Harrington with 30 points (including 
six three-pointers) and Andre James 
with 21 points.
The loss dropped CMUs record to 7 
8 overall and 2-6 in the UAA, while 
Brandeis went to 7-8 overall and 4-3 in 
the UAA. CMUs next game is at home 
on Friday against Washington Univer
sity. Tipoff is scheduled for 8 pm.

CMU hockey club builds on early success
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Since the start of the new se
mester, the CMU hockey club 
has been busy with road trips to 
Meadville and Greensburg, tak
ing on opponents that it defeated 
last semester en route to its fall 
record of 5-1. On January 25,
the Tartans traveled to 
Meadville to take on the Allegh
eny Gators. CMU had an easy 
time of it, winning 11-3 while 
senior captain Ed Kilduff scored 
four goals for the Tartans. This 
past Friday, the team returned 
to Meadville for a late game 
against Slippery Rock Univer
sity, and continued the tempo
set by the spring semesters first 
game, winning 9-1. Saturday 
night, the team traveled to 
Greensburg to take on the home 
team Penn State West. Trailing 
4-2 with two minutes in the 
game, CMU fought back to a tie. 
But, with eight seconds remain
ing, Penn State West managed 
a goal to win the game 5-4.
The team continues on the 
road next weekend with a game 
in Morgantown, West Virginia, 
on Saturday to tackle the West 
Virginia Mountaineers, and a 
shorter trip to Kittaning to take 
on Indiana University of Penn
sylvania. On Friday, February 
14, CMU will take on the only 
team to beat them last semester, University of Pittsburgh, at 
Neville Ice Rink on the South 
Side. February 15 holds in store 
the last road trip of the regular 
season, as the Tartans will travel 
to Johnstown to take on UPJ. 
Februaryl6, the CMU hockey 
club will return to the Neville 
Ice Arena to take on West Vir
ginia again.

Krauss conjures up quality court for King Michael
CAGERS' CORNER
by Chris Cenkner
I know, I know. Last week I 
said I would look and see if the 
upstart Golden State Warriors 
eould take on Michael and the 
Jordanaires, but I decided that I 
>vould hold off on that. Weve 
Still got a little over a half of a 
season to go, so I think Ill do an 
in-depth match-up a little later.
I want to stay with the Bulls 
this week because, frankly, they 
scare me. Throughout the eight
ies, Magic and Bird ruled the 
upper echelon of the NBA. As 
the decade closed, Jordans domi
nance was unquestionable; he 
Was the ruler for the 90s.
, But every mighty king must 
have strong, faithful knights at
his side and King Michael didnt 
really have his Sir Lancelot, if 
you will. He was surrounded by 
stiffs like Brad Sellers and Dave 
Corzine  decent players, but 
not NBA championship-caliber 
players.
So the Bulls owner, Jerry 
(Merlin) Krauss starts to work 
his magic. Into the Chicago 
lineup appears Scottie Pippen, 
Horace Grant, and Bill Cart
wright, and suddenly the Bulls 
' start to breathe down the necks 
of the mighty Bad Boys of De
troit.
In a few seasons, the Chicago 
bench is bolstered with the likes 
of Stacey King (Oklahoma) and 
B. J. Armstrong (Iowa). With his 
new knights, King Michael fi
nally pulled the sword out of the 
stone, winning his first NBA 
crown last season.
It is now almost midway 
through the 1991-92 season, and 
Chicago sits atop the Central 
Division (as of January 31) with 
a 37-7 record. The only team 
that poses any kind of a threat to
Da Bulls is Cleveland. As of 
Friday, the Cavaliers were seven 
games back, but they could be to 
the Bulls what the Bulls were to 
Detroit, a nagging annoyance 
that could keep them out of the 
NBA finals.
However, I dont think that 
will happen. The Bulls are just 
too strong. They know how to 
shut their opponents down. If 
you play an up-tempo game, they 
can run it faster. If you play a 
half-court set, their defense will 
smother you and with the quick 
hands of Jordan and Pippen, 
theyll have a plethora of transi
tion baskets (i.e. Grant slam
ming so hard hell put a hole in 
the floor) and beat you with the 
jam.
And if you manage to build 
any kind of lead, the ball will 
somehow find its way into the 
hands of number 23, wholl start 
to tickle the nylon like only he 
can, raining jumpers from every 
spot on the floor. If you double
team him, he effortlessly zips 
the ball to his companion in the

back court, either John Paxson 
or Craig Hodges, both of whom 
can hit shots as easily as Jordan 
can.
So beware, you teams of the 
Eastern Conference. Ifyou think 
you have the strength to defeat 
the mighty Bulls, think again.
The Celtics are a team experi
encing a changing of the guard, 
with the Bird line fading out and 
the Dee Brown line checking in. 
The Knicks arent mature 
enough yet, especially since this 
is Rileys first season as head 
coach in the Big Apple.

Wilkens: your Caveliers have a

Volume 86, Issue 15The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania3 February 1992Debating vegetarianism
Reasons for avoiding meat vary
By LAURA PALANKER
far tan Asst. Features Editor
Before 1847 they were known 
3 Pythagoreans, after 
Pythagoras, the great mathema
tician, who was a vegetarian, 
reek author Plutarch, French 
ihilosopher Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau, and Russian novelist 
Leo Tolstoy soon followed suit. 
Now everyone from Paul 
McCartney to River Phoenix is 
loing it. Whats got all these 
regetarians hooked anyway? 
There are four generally ac>pted motivations behind vegitarianism: health, animal
human welfare, and the 
environment. Many peoples de
cisions are a combination of 
;hese, but its easier to examine 
>ach separately.
Those who choose vegetarian
ism for health reasons do not
usually refrain from all animal 
flesh but give up red meat or 
other high-cholesterol, high-fat 
meat products. They usually 
become vegetarians on the rec
ommendation of a doctor, as a 
result of an allergy or heart con
dition which dictates they con
sume less or no meat. Any doc
tor will agree that all the protein 
of meat can be obtained from 
eggs or nuts or bean products, 
and it is simple to incorporate 
these into any normal diet. These 
vegetarians are more practical 
than philosophic about their eat
ing habits and will eat seafood 
and/or poultry items which are 
high in protein but not so high in 
fat and cholesterol.
Individuals who are vegetar
ians for animal rights reasons 
are almost always complete veg
etarians (those who eat no flesh) 
and are often vegans. A vegan is 
a person who eats no animal 
flesh or by-product  this in
cludes milk, cheese, eggs and 
lard. Any vegetarian for animal 
rights reasons is such because 
he or she believes that all ani
mals deserve the same right as 
humans not to be innocently 
slaughtered for their muscles 
and organs. The philosophy of 
animal rights vegetarians dic
tates that, although other ani
mals may have lower intelli
gence levels than humans, they 
have a brain and they have a 
heartbeat, so they should be 
treated well. Humans dont kill 
the blind or the mentally re
tarded for their meat or hides, 
and they should not kill animals 
for this reason either. I am in 
favor of animal rights as well as
human rights, said Abraham 
Lincoln, as that is the way of 
the whole human being, and by 
far the greatest number of veg
etarians are so for animal rights 
beliefs.
Vegetarians for human wel
fare are scarce but well-estab
lished in their field. Their rea
soning is that the grain nutri
tion needed to sustain one cow 
or pig to feed* number of people 
is sufficiently more than that 
needed to directly feed those 
same x people. Thus the elimi
nation of meat in the food chain 
would eliminate much of the 
hunger and famine in the world.
Vegetarians for environmen
tal reasons are also few in num
ber. Much rainforest land in 
South and Latin America has 
been deforested to provide cheap

When I grow up I want to live 
in a ramblingfarm house, with a 
'egetable garden in the backprd. In the gargantuan pasure out front, Ill keep munchng, mooing cows, and grunting 
"gs, and if Im lucky, a pond 
nth quacking, waddling ducks 
md squinny, swimmy fish. That 
is why I am a vegetarian  be:ause I could never eat somehing that could be my pet. 
Virtually every meal-time 
mpanionl have had since com
ing to this university has, at one 
Bme or another, made an obnox
ious effort to show me how ri
diculous my boycott of meat is. 
Once they have surmised, from 
by meatless tray, that I did evrything I could to avoid the 
neat selection (at whatever 
ovely CMDS outpost we might 
Pe patronizing), they innocently 
ask, Oh, are you a vedgeT Now, 
although I would never intro
duce myself as a vedge, I go 
with the cute label, usu
ally with the hope that they will 
feop the frustrating and fruitess subject.
Hahah, how foolish I can be. 
As soon as yes rolls off the tip 
f my nave little tongue, their 
onslaught of tedious questions 
pd counter-arguments erupts.
I try to find a haven from 
sir inquisition by changing 
me subject (the reason I stopped 
sating meat in the first place is 
oat the thought of eating meat 
gusts me. Why do they insist 
 making me think of such an 
^appetizing thought, just as I 
trying to eat?) or ignoring 
em, but I never succeed. They 
seem so determined in their 
ursuits that no move on my 
part could alter their path.
through their intentions
By MIKE LIPPERT
Tartan Personnel Manager
Vegetarians are multiplying 
rapidly in todays healthier, more 
politically correct world. While 
everyone is entitled to his or 
her beliefs, it seems that the 
vast majority of college-aged 
vegetarians havent completely 
thought out their reasons for 
convertingto high fiber, no meat 
diets.
What happens, of course, is 
that when many of these people 
are pressed for reasons why they 
became vegetarians, they end 
up sounding foolish because they 
havent thought it all the way 
through. Vegetarians generally 
appeal to four basic rationales 
as the basis for their diets: health 
reasons, human welfare, envi
ronmental reasons, and animal 
rights.
Health Reasons
Vegetarians citing their health 
as an argument for giving up 
meat are usually the quickest to 
stumble in their arguments, 
unless their argument is my 
doctor told me to stop eating it. 
This reason, however, covers 
only a minute fraction of health 
vegetarians.
A well-trained nutritionist will 
tell you that it is not so much the 
red meat that is bad for you, but 
the preparation and quantities 
of the meat consumed. In fact, a 
nutritionist would warn most 
people not to give up meat alto
gether unless the individual 
knows and is prepared to obtain 
ways of making up the essential 
vitamins, minerals, and amino 
acids that meat provides.
This is why many people who 
chose health reasons as their 
argument for giving up meat 
actually dont give it up  they 
just give up the red variety. 
Those who abstain from all meat, 
red or otherwise, are often not 
healthy people because they 
dont know how to go about eat
ing sensibly and correctly to re
trieve the lost nutrients. 
Human Welfare
Vegetarians concerned about 
human welfare appeal to the fact 
that animal stock consumes vast 
quantities of grain that could be 
better used to feed actual people. 
They present several equations 
that show that the amount of 
grain needed to feed one head of 
livestock that feeds one person 
is out of proportion to the num
ber of people that the grain could 
feed directly.
The problem, however, is not 
that cattle, pigs, poultry, et. al., 
are consuming all the grain in 
the world, but that all the grain 
in the world isnt distributed 
properly. There is currently 
enough grain to feed humans 
and livestock, if only the grain 
could find its way out of all the 
silos and unfarmed farm land. 
Vegetarians who claim that the 
cows are getting all the food 
should be less worried about
Not eating them wont make the 
problem go away.
Animal Rights
Vegetarians claiming that 
animals have the same rights to 
life as humans use a variety of 
arguments. Several of these run 
along the line of the blood cours
ing through living flesh and 
how could you eat something 
that was cute and alive variety.
There is one argument, how
ever, that deserves attention,
Josh Freeman/ lartan Photo Ed'tor 
Potatoes are a necessary source of carbohydrates.
what the cows are eating and 
more concerned about how to 
distribute the grain before it rots 
on the ground.
Environmental Reasons
Vegetarians appealing to en
vironmental concerns use a 
variation of the human welfare 
argument. Rather than the 
grain for humans cry, they ar
gue that livestock (specifically 
beef) is responsible for the de
struction of other species and 
their habitats. For examples, 
they point to the rapid defores
tation of the rain forests and the 
loss of several thousand plant 
and animal species.
This argument is a little bit 
harder to topple  that is, until 
the person using the argument 
starts to claim that all this beef 
and such is feeding American 
and European capitalists who 
are, in turn, robbing the poor 
and the Third World blind. Ig
noring most of the opportunities 
to deflate this particular argu
ment, it would seem wise to sug
gest that those vegetarians us
ing this rallying cry to further 
their cause once again stop wor
rying about what the cattle are 
doing and focus on who put the 
cattle there and how to curb it.
mostly because it seems to be 
the only one that has a lot of 
thought behind it. It is also ex
tremely rare to find a vegetar
ian that uses it. The argument 
appeals to a states-of-being phi
losophy.
This argument basically says 
that there are certain states of 
being, and that there are sev
eral levels of being. Being can 
be defined as intelligence, a ner
vous system, or a host of other 
things. Whatever the measure, 
the scale uses humans as its 
comparison.
According to this theory then, 
an animal should not be eaten if 
its state-of-beingis within some 
measure of what is defined as 
humanness. Non-animals 
(plants and such) are edible be
cause they do not fit within this 
required measure. Cows, pigs, 
and poultry rate high enough on 
the state*of being scale to be 
considered sufficiently human. 
Killing them would be morally 
reprehensible.
This argument can be ex
tended to include fish and shell
fish in the sufficiently human 
category. This inclusion weak
ens the argument considerably, 
pnos,o ,oo bL5t rsFo Y
Oddly, each person has the 
same list of arguments, and the 
progression of arguments is iden
tical every time  as if the 
Fleshophilic Society of CMU dis
tributes The Checklist of Annoy
ing Arguments to throw in the 
faces of unwitting vegetarians. 
As you might imagine, I dont 
hav a swell time defending 
myself. In fact, I find having to 
justify my feelings over and over 
again rather exhausting.
So for the sake of saying my 
piece and then shutting up, this 
will be the last time I defend my 
herbivorous lifestyle as long as I
Cantaloupes, apples, and oranges wave to the people walking by.
am at CMU  yeah, right.
The most common argument I 
hear against vegetarianism is 
that vegetarians mess up the 
natural order of the food chain. 
Okay, so I dropped to a lower 
order on the food chain  so 
what? I was never one to care 
much when I lost a game of 
Chutes and Ladders, and I refuse 
to care about my status in the 
hierarchy of whos eating what.  
My rank in the chain just does 
not matter to me. I like to think 
of myself as somewhat upwardly 
mobile, but experiencing anxi
ety over my order in the food 
chain is going a bit far.
Over the break, I watched an 
episode of Sesame Street that 
illustrates my point. One of the 
animated sequences showed a 
tree losing its leaves, the leaves 
falling to the ground, a worm 
eating the leaves, the worm fer
tilizing the soil, and finally, the 
tree taking its nourishment from 
the enriched soil. This cycle went 
on for a while, and the whole 
time I kept thinking what a great 
statement the clip was making

Most of this cattle is bred for

little people lived inside chicken 
eggs. Whew. Id hate to know 
that I had eaten them.)
In a story-telling fashion, 
heres how to use the words 
above:
My yokefellow and I walked 
into the bar where all the people 
were spritzing each other about 
the evils of the working world. I 
promised myself earlier not to 
be too snooty to his friends so 
they wouldnt think we had a 
hypergamous marriage. I took a 
deep breath and swore I would 
forget about my cardiophobiafor 
at least one night. Let the good 
times roll!
I couldnt decide whether I 
should get a Bloody Mary or a 
Screwdriver. Come on, dont 
shilly-shally. We have some ser
ious tippling to do with the other 
bacchanalians here, said my 
yokefellow.
I finally downed a White Rus
sian in one breath and then or
dered another one before we 
joined a group of people sitting 
at one of the tables.
My yokefellow introduced me 
to a friend of his who was an 
anonymuncule who wrote penny 
dreadfuls. Im really a thaumatologist, he said, but the only 
miraculous thing that has hap
pened recently is that my cat
The other day I was bam
boozled into playing a game of 
Scrabble. I hadnt played for five 
years, but figured I could beat 
my opponent with little or no 
effort. After all, I was always 
able to beat everyone I played 
against, even when they had 
better letters than I did. (Come 
to think of it, thats probably 
why I havent been able to con 
anyone into playing with me all 
this while.)
I ended up with an impressive 
score.(for me) of 233 points, or 
thereabouts. It was enough to 
keep my name still shining in 
the Scrabble Hall of Fame. But 
my friend beat me by 158 points.
I couldnt believe it. True, he 
did get 71 points when he put 
out all his letters to spell cave
ats, which landed on double 
word score, double letter score, 
triple word score, and triple let
ter score, and made another word 
across beginning with the s. 
He also got 34 points by plac
ing a single letterxon the 
board. He spelled ax twice, and 
x landed on double letter score, 
making each word worth 17 
points. And that is the only time 
I have ever seen that X truly 
marks the spot.
And so, in an attempt to aug
ment my ability to make better 
use of four is, a u, an h, and 
a k, I looked up some words 
from my 365-words-a-year cal
endar from 1991. Heres a list of 
some words I found that I think 
everyone should know, though I 
cant say they can be placed on a 
Scrabble board with much ease: 
anonymuncule (n): an insig
nificant anonymous writer. 
(Since when were any anony
mous writers significant?)
bacchanalian (adj): 1. of, or 
relating to, the revels for the 
Roman god Bacchus. 2. of, or 
relating to, a drunken feast. (So 
now I have to call people baccha
nalians if they like to drink a lot. 
Dam. I always thought this word 
had Latin roots.)
barmy (adj): having or show
ing unsoundness of mind or 
judgement; crazy, foolish. (This
EVERYBODY TALKS 
ABOUT THE WEATHER
by Susan Abrams
is a perfect description of top
less bar dancers.)
callithump (n): a boisterous 
parade. (Think ofit as elephants 
dancing to calliope music.)
cardiophobia (n): abnormal 
fear of heart disease. (Anyone 
who has this kind of fear will 
probably die of a heart attack 
waiting for it to happen.)
dyspeptic (adj): 1. relating 
to, or having, indigestion. 2. 
showing a sour disposition. (Aha!
I knew Id find the secret behind 
the name Pepto-Bismol!)
expectorate (v): 1. to dis
charge matter from the throat 
or lungs by coughing or hawking 
and spitting. 2. to spit. (Now I 
know what kind of Robitussin to 
buy.)
hyper gamy (n): marriage to 
one of a higher socioeconomic 
class. (So thats what marrying 
a rich person will do to you.)
magnificat (n): a song or 
hymn of praise. (I almost thought 
they were going to rule out the 
dog as mans best friend.)
melomania (n): an inordinate 
liking for music. (You mean 
theres a name for people who 
must have speakers at least fourfeet tall, two CD players, an 
equalizer, a mixer, a stereo, and 
an integrated amplifier all 
hooked up together?)
penny dreadful (n): a novel 
of violent adventure or crime. (I 
suppose the name in itself is a 
very good reason why I dont 
read them.)
shilly-shally (v): to show hesi
tation or lack of decisiveness or 
resolution. (My mother always 
used to tell me not to dilly-dally 
when I was younger. Little did 
she know she mispronounced it.)
spritz (n): an improvised, usu
ally humorous harangue. (So 
then what do we call that stuff

has been hit by cars 10 times 
and is still alive. I cant figure it 
out for the life of me.
Already bored, I couldnt sit 
still for another minute. Being a 
melomanie, I jumped up to join 
the callithump on the dance 
floor. Pretty soon I was leading a 
conga line and then the bunny 
hop. Feeling a bit queasy from 
the still unsettled alcohol, I left 
the line and walked back to the
table where my yokefellow still 
sat, singing magnificats to the 
god of wine with his drinking 
buddies.
Honey, I feel really dyspep
tic. Lets go home.
He grunted, got up, and said 
goodbye to his fellow bacchana
lians. We drove away, and I 
ended up expectorating all over 
the dashboard when we hit a 
thank-you-maam.
Believe me, Im ready to win 
my name back in the Scrabble 
Hall of Fame, and mercilessly if 
need be. And this isnt just an
other barmy threat of mine ei
ther, mind you.

as the entire argument rests on 
some point of comparison. It is 
difficult to imagine humans, 
cattle, and lobsters as common 
beings.
Vegans push the argument one 
step further by asserting that 
the use of eggs and milk is just 
as bad, as it reflects an exploita
tion of a being that humans 
would not carry out on them
selves.
Many vegetarians suffer from 
a more general problem that 
nearly everyone falls prey to at 
some point or another  they 
havent thought their convic-! 
tions all the way through so that 
they reach a defensible argu
ment. If you are a vegetarian

fend your reasons.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 February 1992L3
CMU services are okay
The two major factors which 
amazed me when I initially 
arrived at Carnegie Mellon 
University were the excellent 
student services this univer
sity provides as compared to 
the university I attend in 
Bradford, England, and the 
annual cost of attending this 
university  which is cur
rently approximately $24,000 
per annum.
CMUs annual cost per stu
dent is not to be taken as a 
basis for all universities 
throughout the USA, but bear
ing in mind that this is a pri
vate college and within the 
top 24 in the country, the 
costs are generally higher than 
average here.
Due to the fact that CMU is 
involved in a great deal of re
search and development, a 
sizable proportion of its fi
nances come from the govern
ment  somewhere in the re
gion of $300 million, which by 
British standards is a stag
gering figure.
It is common knowledge in 
England and an ongoing de
bate in the British House of 
Commons (the place where 
legislation is passed) that the 
government funding of uni
versities is, by anybodys stan
dards, meager and is in des
perate need of address.
Although there are plenty of 
state universities throughout 
the USA, these are not to be 
taken in the same context as 
the state universities of En
gland. A clear dichotomy ex
ists between the financing of 
universities in England and 
the USA. My understanding 
of state universities in this
INTERNATIONAL 
EXCHANGES
by Oliver Williams
country is that they are rela
tively easier to get into than 
private universities such as 
CMU.
But this is not the case in 
England. All universities in 
England except one, the Uni
versity of Buckingham, are 
government-financed. Thus, 
even the paramount universi
ties in England  Oxford and 
Cambridge  are state-fi
nanced.
Paradoxically, the Univer
sity of Buckingham is the only 
private college in England and 
generally the grades required 
for entrance into this univer
sity are lower than those re
quired by the state universi
ties.
Considering the fact that 
Bradford Universitys popula
tion of 5,500 is not that far off 
from CMUs, and the fact that 
it has a distinguished reputa
tion in the UK, particularly in 
the fields of engineering and 
management, I would have 
expected similar services to 
those provided at CMU, but 
this not the case.
The library operating hours 
are a good example of the 
marked difference between 
CMUs student services and 
th University of Bradfords.
Specifically, Carnegie Mellons 
Hunt library opens at 8 am 
and closes at 3 am on most 
days, whereas Bradfords li
brary opens at 8:45 am and 
closes at 9 pm
In addition, certain com
puter clusters at CMU have 
24 hour user-consultants, but 
at our computer center at 
Bradford (of which we have 
only two), the consultants are 
available only between nor
mal working hours  9 am to
6 pm.
Also what really disgusts me 
about Bradfords computing 
facilities, having experienced 
CMUs, is the fact that in 
Bradford we have to pay for all 
the Laserjet printouts we 
make.
Furthermore, the five din
ing service locations that are 
available on this campus, not 
only put the University of 
Bradfords to shame, but also, 
like our computing services 
they are open only between 9 
am and 6 pm.
In addition, the food here, 
which is distasteful according 
to the American students I 
have spoken too, is a great improvement on Bradford 
Universitys, which has a very 
limited choice and is barely 
edible.
Thus, without a shadow of a 
doubt, CMUs student services 
by far. outstrip the University 
of Bradfords.

.for a vegetarian life. The worm 
ate the leaves and was happy. 
The tree ate the worm refuse 
and was happy. No blood, guts, 
jjpre, pain, or suffering involved. 
My kind of existence; a little 
idealistic, perhaps, but I can 
think of worse ways to exist  
like the ways most animals who 
re raised for human consump
tion exist.
Another argument is the Well 
 eveiyone became a vegetar|an -. argument, which is a ter
ribly silly discussion to suggest, 
i01 a variety of reasons. First of 
p. it will never happen. While 
in some corners of the world 
Pj-at is impossible to come by, in 
Pther parts, it is the only practi
cal source of food. I feel very 
0ltunate to live in a society 
r ere I have a choice concern
ing such matters.
Secondly, as a counter-argupteQt to my stance as a political 
yegetarian, the Well if everyDne became a vegetarian.... ar
gument is weak because I never 
*ged the planet to conform to 
, y ways of thinking, feeling, or 
fating. I never suggested that 
anyone become a vegetarian. 
astly> the argument fails on
the basis of its conclusion, Well 
if everyone became a vegetarian 
all the plants would be eaten 
and we would all dieSure, if 
all the plants in the world were 
eaten, we would die. But con
sider the following: if we eat 
some plants, we could grow more 
plants. Eureka! Did this thought 
not occur to the Fleshophilic 
Society?
Maybe it has a point in that if 
nobody ate cows, the ensuing 
cow overpopulation would 
strangle the worlds natural re
sources, but by that time we 
humans (or is it hume/i?) would 
probably have done a darn fine 
job of doing that on our own.
The final point my friends and 
acquaintances never fail to bring 
up is that Plants Get Killed, 
Too. Granted, the salad I eat is 
organic matter. However, that I 
am making the plant suffer by 
my killing it is an exasperating 
thought to maintain, much less 
try to rebut. I could never eat 
anything that could be my pet. 
Although I named my last plant 
(Curvy Road), I never thought 
of it as my pet.
I am not a preachy, anal-retentive-type vegetarian, al

Charles Powers unties the Gordian knot
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
The Presidents Distinguished 
Lecture Series presented 
Charles Powers last Thursday, 
speaking on Cutting the Envi
ronmental Gordian Knot. His 
lecture attempted to unravel the 
complications of environmental 
policy-making and to define ex
actly what the policy-making 
problems are.
Powers, who was the chief 
environmental officer at Cum
mings Engineering Company, as 
well as the founder of five non
profit environmental organiza
tions, has determined that 
There are two fundamental 
problems the nation now faces 
... the development of a longterm 
economic policy, including edu
cation for an effective perfor
mance and development of an 
effective system to manage risk, 
both human health and ecologi
cal. These two challenges are 
fully intertwined and they must 
be integrated, not pitted against 
each other.
Powers lecture focused on this 
point and on the action needed 
to take up these challenges. He 
pointed out that none of the 
Presidential candidates has ad
dressed the environmental is
sue, despite the fact that It is 
crystal-clear in January 1992 
that [the United States] must 
grow economically ... and it is 
equally clear that this growth 
must be accomplished without 
destroying the planet on which 
we depend for breath, suste
nance, and other elements of 
human welfare.
Though Powers stressed the 
importance of dealing with the 
environmental policy issue, he 
said, I predict that the political 
and private sector leadership of 
this country is going to embrace 
environmental matters only
symbolically, and to keep duck
ing them substantively, both of 
which they are doing now, until 
somebody cuts the knot.
In order to cut this knot, Pow
ers presented the four parts of 
the central strand which he 
believes must be understood. 
The first part is the need for 
scientifically sound data that 
tells which substances cause 
environmental harm. Powers 
cites the controversy around the 
agenda-setting process as amain 
reason for the publics distrust 
of this type of information.
The second part of the central 
strand is the need for the ability 
to convert the scientific data into 
prioritized inventory which tells 
us how serious hazardous sub
stances are at different levels of 
exposure. He said, Even within 
individual federal agencies, 
there is no organized data that 
sets forth what each agency itverts well-documented risks into 
effective laws and regulations 
which focus mediation, preven
tion, and enforcement on the 
greatest risks first. The final 
part of the strand is the need to 
understand the gain of an accep
tance of risk management ac
tivities mandated by those laws 
so that they can be implemented 
rather than endlessly delayed 
by local community opposition. 
Powers believes that if we are 
all given the chance to begin to 
see that we must manage our 
risky lives, we will learn to live 
with the risks we have chosen 
and are choosing.
Finally, Powers concluded, 
Im now convinced that the 
mechanisms that will cut the 
knot will be independent, non
governmental institutions. They 
will have to do their work on 
three fronts: data generation, 
risk prioritization, and effective

self believes are the substances 
about which it should be most 
concerned at specific levels. 
The strands third part is the 
policy-making process that con
party responses in environmen
tal management, before we will 
see meaningful changes or im
provement in the environmen

be slinking around, ruining my 
reputation. I do not, by prin
ciple, tell others how they ought 
to live, and if they want to eat 
meat, I accept that (perhaps be
cause if I didnt, Id have no 
friends).
In most other matters people 
leave me alone. For instance, I 
did not get my ears pierced  
the accepted thing to do to 
earlobes until this January, 
but no one tried to make an 
issue out of that.
So why is it so difficult for the 
meat-eating population to allow 
me that same choice not to con
sume animal flesh? The thought 
of tearing into a chicken leg 
seems to me as horrific as most 
people view the thought of tear
ing into a human leg; I would 
hate to force my friends to keep 
a diet of human legs.
Many vegetarian-hatersof the 
world, and particularly of CMU, 
make life as a vegetarian an 
obstacle course. And as far as I 
can ascertain,, they have no 
point. Why is it so wrong that I 
refrain from eating something I 
dont enjoy eating? Im not hurt
ing anyone by my silent protest, 
except maybe the meat industry
 and that is my intention.

If you ever happen down to 
the South Side Flats of Pitts
burgh, youll find yourself sur
rounded by,a variety of restau
rants, galleries, and stores 
which flank both sides of 
Carson Street. Two of the newer 
stores there are Slacker and 
Ice Nine Publications, which 
share a /space located a few
doors down from the Beehive. It 
isnt uncommon to see people in 
the Beehive wearing clothes they 
bought at Slacker or reading a 
book they just bought at Ice Nine.
The first thing youll notice 
when you walk into Slacker is 
the artwork, namely the photo
graphs of J.R. Bob Dobbs, who 
is the icon associated with the 
Church of the Sub-Genius, and 
the Sonny and Cher portrait 
hanging on the wall. Slackers 
floor is art, too, with its psyche
delic spray paint look. It is 
sometimes hard to pay atten
tion to the merchandise when 
the surroundings are so elabo
rately decorated.

There are many restaurants 
in Pittsburgh to choose from. 
There are the obvious Chinese, 
Italian, Indian, and Middle 
Eastern restaurants 
surrounding Carn
egie Mellon, but 
sometimes these res
taurants do not fit 
into a college stud
ents budget. Some
times there are res
taurants hidden in a 
corner though  
ones that serve good 
food and are reason
ably priced. Yacovs 
Vegetarian and 
Dairy Restaurant is 
one of these places.
The cook at Yacovs 
wears a black 
Harley-Davidson tshirt under his apron 
and is built like an 
iceberg. Hes also so 
soft-spoken that you 
might not hear him 
ask for your order.
Watching the big 
man reheat a falafel 
sandwich is like see
ing the mythical 
John Henry, retired 
and stoking the fires 
for the machine age.
But the unusual 
cook seems to belong 
inside this unusual 
restaurant. When 
you walk past 
Yacovs, for example, 
headed towards DsdmNH, 
Frames Unlimited, 
you see your reflection staring 
back between pink placards 
that advertise vegetarian 
chopped liver and vegetarian 
hamburgers. Yacovs seems 
dark from outside and you 
might even think that its 
closed. But its open, selling a
unique assortment of dishes in 
its surprisingly bright interior.
The restaurant is about twice 
the size of a hoop skirt, with 
orange tables and a tiled floor. 
Watercolors along both walls 
portray pale figures in magentasplashed backgrounds. On the 
wall above where the cook stands 
hangs a Coke advertisement 
written in Hebrew.
Any average restaurant might 
advertise Coke, but of course,
m99oe, NoFoiseusl 9mmC, 9me snn is,io,T
Yacovs isnt average. A combi
nation of ethnic dishesliquidcheese pizza placed beside chick
pea falafels  introduces cus
tomers to a hodge-podge of un
usual dishes at fast food prices. 
One cook recited the menu by 
heart in under a minute: floun
der plate, tuna plate, lasagna, 
barakasas, baba ghanooj, 
falafels... the list continued like 
some huge Roman orgy.
A falafel is a Jewish sand
wich, something like a vegetar
ian burrito. It is pita bread 
stuffed withfried chick-peas that 
are rolled into a ball, covered 
with green salad, and saturated 
with a pungent sesame seed 
sauce. Deep-fried chick-peas 
look surprisingly like meat
balls, which may be in
tentional.
The other beanbased meat substi
tutes  the vegetar
ian chili, hamburger, 
and chopped liver  
also give bean-eaters 
a taste from the omni
vores world. Unfortu
nately, only omnivores 
can judge whether veg
etarian liver matches 
the real thing.
If you go to Yacovs 
for the pizza, an un
common delicacy of 
both Italian and 
American origins, you 
have to pass three or 
more full-fledged piz
zerias on the way. 
Theres no guarantee 
that covering the ex
tra distance will lead 
you to a higher plane 
of existence, but 
Yacovs has ready
made cheese slices that 
are still good enough 
to put hair on your 
gullet. Whether pizza 
is actually the dairy 
portion of Yacovs offi
cial name is a mystery.
For dessert at 
Yacovs there is the 
delicious baklava 
pastry. So if you spend 
time in Squirrel Hill, look for 
Yacovs on Murray Avenue, right 
across the street from a place 
called Buns. Yacovs is ulti
mately a vegetarians vision of 
variety, and a meat-eaters in
troduction to interesting veg
etable variations.
Please see EXPLORING, page Lll
In the front portion of Slacker 
there is a variety of funky cloth
ing  the best part of which is 
the t-shirt collection. There are 
shirts that sport the Brady 
Bunch, David Cassidy, and in
teresting slogans, such as I have 
a mouth, I should speak. Cen
sorship is weak, and Jesus died 
for our sins and all I got was this 
lousy t-shirt.
As you move towards the 
middle of the store, you encoun
ter a carpeted platform fur
nished with black velvet Victorian-style couches. Next to the 
seating area is a myriad of shoes 
ranging from Dr. Martens to 
Berlin Walls. Most of the shoes 
come in basic black, but there is 
the occasional pair of royal blue 
ones in the lineup.
Ice Nine Publications takes 
up the back space of the store. 
This section carries comicbooks, 
magazines, and novels. Besides 
carrying the Marvel, Epic, and 
DC lines that most comic lovers 
desire, there are unusual indie 
comics as well.
Most of the magazines that 
Ice Nine carries cater to those 
involved in the growing under
ground scene in Pittsburgh. One 
of the most interesting and some
what repulsive publications is 
RE I Search, which contains ar
ticles on tattooing, body pierc
ing, and unique rituals to per
form on ones genitalia.
The novels displayed in the 
back of the store are equally as 
interesting. There are books 
like Manson in His Own Words, 
Dead Elvis, and Satanic Witch. 
If youre looking for Danielle 
Steeles latest, youre not going 
to find it here.
Together, Slacker and Ice Nine 
Publications are relatively inex
pensive sources of just about 
everything needed for the un
derground scene. Although they 
cant compare to the big name 
alternative shops in such big 
cities as New York and Chicago, 
they have a great combination 
of atmosphere and goods that 
makes them a great place to 
explore. Theres always room for 
the unique.

Periodically the standard col
lege tedium of work, sleep, and 
an occasional weekend of excess 
needs to/ be interrupted with 
what carionly be called enlight
enment of the soul. For some 
this might mean watching pub
lic television, but for others it 
means nothing less than the 
pursuit of art. Fortunately, Pitts
burgh has been blessed with a 
growing art community; despite 
the recession, new galleries, per
formance spaces, and coffee 
houses have been opening 
throughout the city. Artists 
couldnt be happier.
But in your search for art, you 
may find that major museums 
like The Carnegie have lost their 
appeal (or just cost too much). 
The best, cheapest, and most 
enjoyable alternative is gallery 
hopping. The best place to go to 
gallery hop is undeniably the
South Side, with its wide vari
ety of antique stores, clothing 
stores, and a number of com
mercial and non-commercial gal
leries which ensure that there is 
always something interesting to 
be seen.
One of the final destinations 
of any artistic pilgrimage 
through the galleries and shops 
of the South Side is undoubtedly 
the Carson Street Gallery. For 
six years, the Carson Street Gal
lery has been operating as one of 
the leading gallery spaces in 
Pittsburgh. Showcasing a large 
amount of regional art, it has 
work by many of the areas best 
artists, many of whom are pro
fessors or alumni of CMU. The 
works that the gallery displays 
range in style and execution, 
but all share an experimental 
and often times humorous out
look.
The gallery is organized into a 
main exhibition area and sev
eral adjoining spaces, allowing 
the viewer freedom and the abil
ity to poke around through the 
gallerys eclectic permanent col
lection. The entrance space 
houses a variety of small and 
odd works of art that range from
Daniel Frey/Tartan Art Editor 
Slacker draws customers into store with display window.
tiny knick-knacks to potent min
iature pieces. The entrance is 
also used to display the exten
sive inventory of work owned by 
the Carson Street Gallery. The 
main gallery space is much less 
cluttered and much less sponta
neous, but the work chosen is 
often of a fairly high quality.
The gallery consistently re
mains fresh and every month or 
so changes its main showing. 
Although the gallery focuses on 
traditional two dimensional 
work, i.e. paintings and draw
ings, it does occasionally show 
work that extends beyond those 
barriers.
On Febuary 8, the gallery will 
hold an opening reception for an 
installation by local photogra
pher Lorraine Vullo and her fa
ther Frank. This site-specific 
piece will deal with the artists 
personal understanding of home 
and her Italian heritage.
If your weekend plans extend 
beyond the usual campus activi
ties, hop on a bus and venture 
down to the Carson Street Gal
lery. With its new and unique 
works, you will find yourself 
content at the end of your pur
suit for art.

Cuarteto Latinoamericano experiments with cacophony
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Junior Staff writer
 Cuarteto Latinoamericano is 
a' string quartet in residence at 
Carnegie Mellon. It is composed 
of four members; Saul, Aron, 
and Alvaro Bitran (all broth
ers), and Javier Montiel. The 
quartet has toured many major 
European music centers and has 
be;en broadcasted on the radio 
and television on three conti
nents. Cuarteto Latino
americano was formed in 1981 
and was awarded the 1983 prize 
of the Music Critics Association 
of Mexico. In short, they are a 
well recognized group of talented 
musicians.
I went to see a concert by 
Cuarteto Latinoamericano at 
Mellon Institute Auditorium last 
Wednesday night. Knowing only 
that the group was made up of 
two violins, a viola, and a cello, I 
prepared myself for an hour or 
two of classical music. I was in 
for a surprise.
The first piece was Crisantemi. 
Somber, traditional, and classi
cal, the piece was pretty tame, 
not too exciting. It was a study

in modulation though. It slowly 
built to a final climax, then 
quickly died away. It was pic
ture perfect, but there were no 
thrills. The most entertaining 
part was watching the players 
bob and dive their heads in uni
son, seemingly to keep time.
Next came the world premiere 
of the String Quartet No. 2 (Homage to Victor Jar a, 1988) by Celso 
Garrido Lecca. World premiere! 
The crowd was tense with an
ticipation. The four players re
turned to the stage and sat anx
iously waiting to begin. The first 
note sounded like a turntable 
needle being pulled across a 
record.
O The note continued for at least 
five seconds  all four of them 
playing it, each one with a dif
ferent squeaky note, each one 
playing a different rhythm, with 
no apparent coherency. As the 
quartet continued, two of the 
players would occasionally form 
a connection, but would quickly 
jump away concentrated on 
keeping the disjointed noise in
tact. I was reminded of an old 
Pink Floyd concert where the 
musicians pounded on their in
struments randomly, with only 
the drums keeping a sense of 
organization. The Cuarteto 
Latinoamericano sure could 
have used some drums.
Come to think of it, they kind 
of sounded like Pink Floyd, too
 circa 1968. High squeaky 
keyboard notes versus high 
squeaky violins  its hard to 
imagine which sounds worse. In 
the middle of the prologue, there 
was a neat cello solo, but thats 
all that was redeeming about it.
There is one good aspect about 
the performance of this piece; 
the four players had their tim
ing down perfectly. Somehow 
they all managed to play a sePennsylvania

lies of spaced out quarter notes 
together; maybe its because they 
all had their faces buried in the 
sheet music.
Suddenly, there was a 
wonderous event. The four in
struments became one. There 
was a single, pure tone that was 
totally out of place with the noise 
that proceeded it. All too soon 
there was a pause, and then a 
mournful endingto the prologue. 
Only four more movements un
til the intermission.
The second move
ment, Canticum 
(First Elegy) was 
simply awesome.
The four players al
ternately plucked 
and strummed on 
their instruments, 
bows forgotten. The 
music got faster and 
faster, more and 
more frantic. I had 
images of machines 
and robots in my 
head frantically 
moving about. In
credible! Suddenly, 
there was a run 
from Rod Stewarts 
Maggie May. Im not 
kidding; Maggie 
May. The move
ment was over all 
too soon.
Next came a brief 
interlude, and then 
Canticum (Second 
Elegy) began. It 
was more 1968 Pink 
Floyd, but it was 
pretty good. The 
music was stirring, 
energetic, and fast, 
and the climax was fast and fu
rious.
The epilogue flowed very 
smoothly, but with four instru
ments playing three different 
lines, it was confusing and 
crowded. As the song built up, 
the four instruments seemed to 
combine again, and they pro
duced a note that sounded ex
actly like a woman singing. The 
moment was perfect, and was 
over far too soon. Unfortunately, 
the ending flopped, with the 
music dying out with a whining 
that is vaguely reminiscent of 
waves.
The quartet was joined by four 
other musicians for the second 
part of the concert. Unfortu
nately for them, but, as I was to 
find out, not for us, they were 
pushed into the background.
The second half of the concert 
contained Octet for Springs, 
Opus 20 by Mendelssohn. I had 
been told that the new first vio
lin (Andres Cardenes, CMU As
sociate Professor of Music and
concertmaster for the Pitts
burgh Symphony) played 
beautifully, and I was not dis
appointed. He was superb. His 
playing brought a new life to 
the concert, one which had 
been totally lacking thus far. 
It was obvious why he was the 
first chair; his playing was 
seamless and energetic, with
out flaw, and a delight to hear. 
If I werent taking notes, I 
would have totally forgotten 
about the rest of the concert;
v(as almost as good as the first. 
There were several times when 
the musicians started playing 
their lines in order, from bot
tom to top. That is to say, the 
second cello started his line, fol
lowed by the first cello, then the 
second viola, first viola, fourth 
violin, and so on. It was very 
impressive, and despite the 
numbei of instruments playing 
different lines, it all fit together 
perfectly;The movement was a 
series of crescendos, which died

Cardenes is truly incredible. The 
first movement, Allegro 
Moderato, ma con fucco (mod
erately fast, but not too fast, for 
those of you not in the know) 
was wonderful. Everything from 
a beautiful series of runs to the 
apparently orchestrated loud 
breathing of the musicians was 
simply incredible. I think that 
this movement alone is worth 
the $15 admission price.
The second movement fell flat. 
It was too slow, too calm, and 
too boring. Enough said.
The third movement, 
Scherzo, was pretty good. It 
was quick, enticing, and urgent
 a big relief after the second 
movement. One interesting as
set to the piece was the twonote melody line contributed 
by a player, followed by the next 
player who again contributed 
two notes, then the next, and so 
on. I could hear the music jump
ing around the semi-circle of 
the musicians  good stuff.
The final movement, Presto,'
away and began anew. It was 
very tense music and the ending 
was superb.
When the music ended, the 
musicians stood and so did five 
other people. One gave a stand
ing ovation, the other four pulled 
on their coats and left. This is 
pretty indicative of the concert 
as a whole; some loved it, some 
hated it, and the rest were mixed. 
I was mixed, mostly because of 
the horrid first movement of the 
String Quartet No. 2. Speaking 
of which....
If you are a purist when it 
corns to classical music, dont go 
to see this piece. If you are more 
liberal, you might like it.
The quartet is a talented group, 
to judge by their accomplish
ments. On this particular occa
sion however, they failed to de
liver their full potential. 
Crissanteni was played with 
little emotion and String Quar
tet No. 2 had mixed qualities. 
The quartet'was upstaged by 
Cardenes. Better luck next time.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  3 February 1992Lll:
PBS delivers quality childrens programming
Ive never been very impressed 
by public television. When I hear 
it mentioned, I usually think of 
hoity-toity dramas such as Mas
terpiece Theatre, in-depth 
yawners like The MacNeil/ 
lehrer Newshour, countless 
unfunny British sitcoms, and 
interminable pledge breaks. 
Generally speaking, Im content 
to take in yet another Whos the 
Boss rerun rather than venture 
into the world of PBS.
The one consistently worth
while area of programming on 
PBS, for me anyway, has been 
childrens programming. Like 
most kids, I grew up with Sesame 
Street and Mister RogersNeigh
borhood (and Electric Company 
when I got a bit older). These 
shows were both educational and 
(un to watch.
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
show parodies to the deadpan 
delivery oiMathnet to the crime 
shows slogan (to cogitate and 
to solve, of course), theres 
plenty to keep the adult-sized 
brain busy.
Secondly, Im sure it couldn't 
hurt most of us to brush up on 
our math skills. I was in junior 
high the last time I heard Fi
bonacci numbers mentioned. 
Evenforgrown-ups, Square One
.without exception, these are highquality programs that are a pleasure 
to watch.
It seems that public televi
sion offers up a new kids series 
just about every year. The amaz
ing part is that, without excep
tion, these are high-quality pro
grams that are a pleasure to 
watch.
There are three public televi
sion series I try not to miss: 
Square One TV and Where in the 
World is Carmen Sandiego?  
both educational shows, and 
DeGrassi High, a serial for teen
agers. All three deserve a closer 
look.
Square One TV: This 30- 
minute series of skits and black
outs tries to teach math to kids 
by trickery. A contestant on a 
game show may have to do some 
intense multiplication to win the 
prize or the punchline of a funny 
skit might rely on the under
standing of a complicated for
mula. Viewers end up learning 
math skills whether they want 
to or not.
Every half-hour ends with an 
episode of Mathnet, a dead-on 
parody of Dragnet. Each day, 
Sergeant Monday and her part
ner must track down a dastardly 
criminal  and, of course, the 
key to the mystery always has 
something to do with math. The 
other day, Monday had to figure 
out Fibonacci numbers, of all 
things, to catch the bad guy.
This show isnt just for kids. 
Its always been true that the 
best childrens shows are the 
ones we can still enjoy as adults 
{Bullwinkle, for example). 
Square One TV is no exception. 
From the tongue-in-cheek game
TV provides both entertainment 
and education.
Where in the World is 
Carmen Sandiego?: This
game show is Double Dare for 
smart kids: tougher questions, 
no slime, and just as much (if not 
more) entertainment value.
Carmen Sandiego is based on 
the computer game of the same 
name. In it, players chase the 
evil Sandiego across the world, 
(inadvertently) brushing up on 
their geography skills along the 
way. The premise of the TV ver
sion is basically the same. Three 
contestants each try to get pro
moted to master detective by 
capturing the slimy crook of the 
day.
Round 1 is a simple questionand-answer setup. The multiple 
choice geography questions may 
seem simple at first, but trust 
me, theyre not. Every time I 
watch, I am amazed by how 
much I dont know  and how 
much the adolescent contestants 
do know.
After Round 1, the third-place 
finisher is sent away, but not 
without some parting gifts from 
the Chief. Sitting in her office 
next to the .game-show set, the 
Chief breaks into the action ev
ery few minutes to hand out as
signments or console the losing 
contestants. With a stem look 
and a deep monotone, all tonguein-cheek, the Chief and her 
straightforward speeches never 
fail to' entertain.
Round 2 is a rather pointless, 
luck-of-the-draw matching game 
where a second contestant is
eliminated. The winner of Round 
2 captures the days nasty vil
lain  but ringleader Carmen 
Sandiego is still on the loose!
The excitement reaches its 
pinnacle in the final round. The 
host and winning contestant run 
over to a giant map of some part 
of the world (say, Asia). As the 
host calls out the name of a coun
try, the contestant must pick up 
a big marker, run across the 
map, and place the marker on 
the correct country. The catch 
is: the contestant has to find 
seven different countries in 45 
seconds. Then, and only then, is 
Carmen Sandiego captured. This 
is one of the most difficult final 
rounds on any game show. I have 
seen it done successfully only 
three times out of countless 
viewings. The victorious player 
must be intelligent and quick.
Rounding out each show are 
selections from doo-wop group 
Rockapella, who provide all the 
music for the program, includ
ing an incredibly catchy theme 
song.
The only depressing aspect of 
Carmen Sandiego is my own stu
pidity. The fact that I would prob
ably lose to almost all of the kids 
on this show upsets me a bit. 
But if I keep watching, I can 
only get smarter, right?
DeGrassi High :This drama, 
producedin Canada, started out 
a few years ago as a series of 
specials called The Kids of 
DeGrassi Street. Each show fol
lowed the adventures of a group 
of young children. After a couple 
of years of this, the show gradu
ated to weekly status and got a 
new name, DeGrassi Junior 
High. The program became 
much more of a serial, chroni
cling the lives of several junior 
high school students. After three 
years, the students went on to 
high school, and the title changed 
accordingly.
This is not a normal teen show. 
Sure, there are typical plots, such 
as who should I ask to the Prom, 
will I fail my final exam, etc. But 
mixed in with these are more 
serious issues, such as depres
sion, sex, suicide, pregnancy, 
homosexuality, and others, that 
have barely seen the light of day
on television in general, much 
less on a show geared toward 
teens.
What really makes this show 
special is the way in which it 
handles these issues. They are 
simply subplots among other 
subplots. No one stops the show 
and says, Look, ateenage preg
nancy, how daring of us. The 
producers have set out to cap
ture teenage life as it really is 
and they have succeeded.
Another reason for the shows 
success is the casting. Every 
actor was pulled from public 
schools in Toronto. The result is 
that instead of Hollywood blowdried pseudo-kids, we get real 
kids, kids who maybe arent so 
pretty, kids who maybe arent 
so happy. Instead of actors read
ing lines, these come off as kids 
living their lives.
DeGrassi High is one of the 
most touching programs on the 
air today. The action seems so 
real at times that I feel as if I am 
reliving high school. All the emo
tions, good and bad, come rush
ing back. Ive never had that 
response to Saved by the Bell, 
Beverly Hills 90210, an ABC 
Afterschool Special, or any other 
mass-produced teen shows.
There is some quality stuff 
on PBS that is also entertain
ing. If you share my public tele
vision phobia, try doing what I 
did: turn on some kids shows. 
Youre in for a nice surprise

EXPLORING, from page L9
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Ornette Coleman, perhaps 
the greatest jazz revolution
ary of all time, is being spon
sored by The Pittsburgh New 
Music Ensemble.
The Pittsburgh New Music 
Ensemble plays classical mu
sic written solely by living composers  no Bach, no 
Beethoven, no Mozart. In
stead, the Ensemble has pre
miered over 75 works, and 
brings in the worlds finest 
stars and the worlds finest 
current classical composers to 
make The Pittsburgh New 
Music Ensemble one of the 
finest avant garde groups in 
new-age music today.
The creator and conductor 
of The Pittsburgh New Music 
Ensemble is David Stock, who 
was Composer-In-Residence 
for the Pittsburgh Symphony 
for the 1987-88 season. His 
compositions have been played 
on three continents. He has 
previously served on the fac
ulties at seven different uni
versities (including Carnegie 
Mellon), and is now an associ
ate professor at Duquesne Uni
versity. The Pittsburgh New 
Music Ensemble is in resi
dence at Duquesne, and Stock
also conducts the Duquesne 
Contemporary Ensemble. As 
the creator of the Pittsburgh 
New Music Ensemble, he has 
the ability to introduce audi
ences to such greats as 
Coleman.
Ornette Coleman was bom 
in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1930, 
and he was playing the saxo
phone by age 14. Self-taught, 
he joined his first band at age 
19. He finally left the South 
with Pee Wee Craytons band 
several years later. Appar
ently, Coleman had already 
picked up the style that would 
later make him famous; ru
mor has it that Crayton was 
paying Coleman not to solo. 
In the early fifties, musicians 
would literally walk off the 
stage whenever he played. In 
the 60s, Coleman was instru
mental in the free jazz move
ment (named after his own 
album, Free Jazz), and in the 
70s, he was prominent in the 
loft scene of New York City. 
Currently, he is performing 
with his band Prime Time, 
which he formed in 1975.
Prime Time is a band that is 
unusual not only in its music, but in its choice of instru
ments. Prime Time consists 
of two guitarists, two drum
mers, two bassists, and 
. Coleman, who plays saxo
phone, violin, and trumpet. 
The band uses elements of 
jazz, funk, R&B. Anyone with 
a taste for avant-garde music 
should plan to see Coleman.

23rd International Tournee 
of Animation
If you enjoyed the 2nd Animation Celebration 
last weekend at DH 2210, this weeks collection of 
animated films should be equally exciting. This 
world renowned animation festival contains nine
teen acclaimed films that are bound to change 
ones views about the cartoons generally seen on 
television.
Amongst the films being shown is Push Comes 
to Shove by Bill Plympton, whose work was also 
featured in the 2nd Animation Celebration, a col
orful piece by David Fain called Oral Hygiene, and 
Gregory Grants Ode to G.I. Joe which uses mili
tary dolls in a unique way. Other works included 
in this compilation look just as promising.
For an evening of colorful and unique fun 
flicks run on down to DH 2210. Animated films 
like this are not always this easy to find.

Dead Again
Everyone should spend about two hours at the 
edge of their seats for this film. It is a scary 
experience trying to decide who is going to kill who 
and who has killed who in Dead Again.
The movie begins in black and white, with one 
of the two characters portrayed by Kenneth 
Branagh informing us, This is all far from over. 
The movie then switches to the present, in color. 
Branaghs second character appears. He is a pri
vate eye who has been asked to determine the 
identity of a woman with amnesia.
Though every indication is that someone will 
soon be dead (again), Branagh and his client are 
falling in love and are determined to make their 
situation work out the second time.

Madonna: Truth or Dare
The crotch-grabbing pop icon of the 80s is back 
in the behind-the-scenes documentary of her 1990 
Blond Ambition Tour. Truth or Dare is raw, raun
chy, and enjoyable although it is obvious that 
every move Madonna makes is for the camera.
Madonna shows us her various talents through
out the film. We see her cramming food into her 
mouth, rolling around on top of her mothers grave, 
and performing fellatio on a plastic water bottle. It 
is surprising that director Alex Keshian didnt 
film her passing a bowel movement. The entire 
piece displays that Madonna loves herself as much 
or more than her fans do and will go to all mea
sures to shock people.
For those who are interested in seeing Madonna 
sweat on stage and cause havoc backstage, the two 
hour piece is worth seeing. The movie doesnt 
expose anything new about Madonna  it just 
reconfirms her exhibitionist nature.

Presumed Innocent
Sometimes the art of transforming novels into 
movies doesnt work. Wonderful plots and charac
ters are turned into marshmallow fluff onscreen. 
Unfortunately, Presumed Innocent is among the 
unsuccessful attempts at recreating a good novels 
attributes.
Harrison Ford is an attorney obsessed with a 
fellow worker, Greta Scacchi. When Scacchi is 
murdered, the blame is put on Ford. His affair 
with the seductive lawyer is revealed and al
though Ford protests that he is innocent, there 
does not seem to be too much hope for him.
The acting in the film dulls the entire plot. Ford 
portrays his character weakly showing little emo
tion, and Scacchi does not exude the sex her 
character does in the book. For a quick read of the 
book, see the movie, but if you want quality, 
borrow the novel from the library.

Love Crimes
? ??i/2
Love Crimes, starring Sean 
Young and Patrick Bergin, is an 
odd, lukewarm dish. When a 
Machiavellian district attorney 
(Young) decides to track down a 
serial killer, she finds herself 
reopening old wounds from her 
disturbing past. She learns the 
important lesson that if you lie 
with dogs, you will surely get 
fleas.
The films strong point is its 
ability to constantly turn away 
from stereotypes typical of such 
horrendous psycho thrillers 
like Sleeping with the Enemy. 
The film seems to be a deeply 
personal tale whose first pur
pose is to provoke thought rather 
than fit the Hollywood mold of 
cinematic entertainment. It con
stantly asks disturbing ques
tions about the nature of good, 
evil, and perversity.
Young delivers a very 
Sigourney Weaveresque perfor
mance, while villain Bergin 
seems to relish his role as the 
sociopathic pervert. Director 
Lizzy Bordens film is essentially 
a complex morality play that 
will fail as a commercial success 
because it caters to a decidedly 
alternative audience that enjoys 
a decent helping of food for 
thought instead of Coke and 
popcorn.

Everybody thrives on rumors. 
You dig em, I dig em, house
wives dig em. One of the big
gest rumors Ive heard lately is 
that Depeche Mode has new ma
terial out. Well, guess what 
kiddies, its true. But its defi
nitely not what youd expect. The 
song (yup, just a song, no new 
album until the fourth quarter 
of92 or the first quarter of93) 
is called Deaths Door and is a 
part of the soundtrack to a nev' 
movie released in Germany ^re

I believe) called Until the End of

rest of the soundtrack: REM, 
the infamous Nick Cave and the 
Bad Seeds, Neneh Cherry, the 
incomparable Elvis Costello, Lou 
Reed, Patti Smith, k. d. lang,

If you thought Depeche Mode 
was depressing, you are in for it. 
Every single song on this 
soundtrack is totally life-sucksand-I-wanna-die-and-nothingsever-gonna-change-so-go-awayand-let-me-die. I gotta warn you: 
if you regularly consider suicide, 
this album is not for you. Its an

listing on it. But quick cuts: Elvis 
Costello? Dark? No way\ Yes 
way. Pretty cool tune. Lou Reed 
is as dark and spooky as ever. 
The Depeche Mode single sounds 
a lot like the songs on Martin 
Gores Counterfeit EP that came 
out two years ago. Decent, but 
different, in their rockabilly 
way, R.E.M.s tune adds the 
magic touch to depressing mu
sic quite well.
I dont know about this one. Its 
cool, in its own way, but youve 
got to be (or pretend to be) a 
severe manic depressive to re
ally love it.

book showcases the ability of 
the authors to craft realistic 
portrayals of actual historical 
figures, and to create a realistic 
world, taking into account the 
increased ability of the British 
Empire to remain powerful, with 
the help of the worlds most ad
vanced information and produc
tion technology. They also cre
ate an interesting London, a city 
choked with people and coalburning steam engine pollution.
The plot, involving three 
people pulled into a whirlwind 
of political intrigue, is unfortu
nately the books main short
coming, when it should be its 
saving grace. The confusing plot 
combined with too many char
acters who have motivations 
that are frequently difficult to 
fathom make the twisting, turning, three-pronged storyline'al
most impossible to follow.
I cant unreservedly recom
mend this book, though hardcore 
fans of Gibson and Sterling 
should probably rush out to buy 
it now that it has been released 
in a paperback edition. It is cer
tainly worth reading for its in
teresting depiction of Victorian 
England and its most interest
ing character, Edward Mallory, 
but the book loses much due to 
its convoluted plot.

genre worthy of its niche in his
tory. Now, a decade later, the 
giants of the genre are trying to 
cash in. The most recent of these 
efforts is the release by the Pet 
Shop Boys (PSB), Discography. 
This has got every PSB song you 
could ever want, ranging from 
their first hit in October ofl985, 
West End Girls, to two new 
songs written for the compila
tionDJ Culture and Was It 
Worth It?
I dont know about the two 
new songs. First of all, what the 
hecks up with a title like DJ 
Culture? It doesnt really stick 
out in my mind as a PSB-type 
song at all. It says inside it was 
written as a response to the Gulf 
War and public reaction to it. 
Right, whatever. If you say so, 
Neil. A mediocre track, at best. 
Was It Worth It? is not much 
better. I really dont have a lot to 
say about it other than generic 
PSB output. It should be released 
soon domestically, if it makes it 
in England.
Despite the disappointingnew 
tracks, there are sixteen excel
lent tracks to check out. My faves 
are Suburbia, Heart, So 
hard, and Where the Streets 
Have No Name. Get it, but try 
to find it on sale if you can.
