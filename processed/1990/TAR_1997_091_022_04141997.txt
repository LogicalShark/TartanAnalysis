Academic Council 
rejects Senate plan
Must-see TV.
By MAUREEN McGRANAGHAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Senate submitted a proposal 
to the Academic Deans Council on April 
4 to give priority to double majors and 
minors in a standardized system of reg
istration. After reviewing the proposal, 
the Council decided last Friday to reject 
Senates recommendation in favor of the 
current plan, which suspends priority 
for double majors in all departments, 
starting in the spring of 1998.
Right now, we want to go with a 
system that gives priority to class and 
primary major because the data we have 
suggests that such a system will work, 
said Eric Grotzinger, associate dean of 
the Mellon College of Science. He em
phasized the School of Computer Sci
ence as a key example; SCS does not 
offer double majors priority in registra
tion, yet, as Grotzinger points out, all 
students who have declared a double 
major in computer science have been 
able to complete it.
He also notes that, according to the 
statistics from Spring 1997, only 11 per
cent of the student population has a 
double major, and of that 11 percent, the
majority are majoring in two closely 
related fields that have overlapping re
quirements. For instance, 44 electrical 
and computer engineering majors have 
declared a double major in computer 
science, and 42 engineering students 
are double majoring in engineering and 
public policy.
Students, however, have expressed 
concern over the changes in registra
tion, leading Student Body President 
Bryon Krug to draft the resolution that 
the Council considered. It became very 
apparent that students werent happy 
with the proposed changes, Krug said.
The proposal, which Krug submitted 
to the Senate for review and revision, 
supports the status quo, in which each 
department determines who receives 
priority. However, Student Senate also 
suggests their own priority system for 
the University because the new on-line 
registration requires some sort of stan
dardized method.
Their proposal gives double majors of 
any year second priority after all pri
mary majors. Minors would receive pri
ority within their class. We wanted to 
show that we understand the rationale

GSA supporters, unhappy with the

means to attain autonomy. This would 
force Senate to resolve the conflict, how
ever it threatens student sovereignty.

a very viable option. We will proceed with 
that if we really need to."

official representative for undergradu

The proposals failure to pass Senate 
after GSA unanimously approved it on 
April 2, has stirred dissatisfaction 
among committee members and repre
sentatives. I have heard a significant 
amount of disappointment over the reso
lution not being passed, said Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Affairs.
We were shocked and surprised af
ter so much hard work, time, and com
mitment. We thought this decision was 
counterproductive, said Jay 
Shankavaram, GSA president and a 
PhD student in the Department of Ar
chitecture.
The proposal could be reconsidered 
on April 15 but if it fails a second time, 
it would not be brought up for about 
another two to three weeks when the 
next Senate session begins its term.
The topic of graduate and under
graduate shared or distinct governance 
has been an issue on the campus for 
many years. The most recent proposal

Senior art major, Erin Salzer 
won the grand prize of $1000 for 
her re-design of the Chanel N5 
bottle, as part of the In the 21st 
Century competition. Students 
were asked to submit their ideas 
for a new concept for the popular 
perfume bottle.
The competition, which was 
sponsored by Chanel, 
Kaufmanns, and the Andy 
Warhol Museum, the largest 
single-artist museum in the 
world, was held in recognition of 
the 75th anniversary of the fra
grance Chanel N 5. Contestants 
were judged by a panel of judges 
consisting of Thomas Sokolowski, 
the director of the Andy Warhol 
Museum, and various executives 
from Kaufmanns and Chanel.
The competition was open to 
students who are currently in a 
college art program in regions in 
which Kaufmanns Department 
Store operates, namely New York, 
Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
Salzer was drawn to this com
petition when she saw fliers ad
vertising it around the mailboxes
in the art department.
I love Chanel and I 
love Warhol so thats 
why I decided to do 
this project, said 
Salzer. She found out 
about the competition 
about a week and a 
half before the dead
line and worked for 
three days before she 
was satisfied with her

The Carnegie Express, a 
shuttle service providing free 
transportation to various offcampus locations, has been 
sponsored by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs for three week
ends this semester.
The shuttle took students 
to Squirrel Hill, Edgewood 
Town Center, and Monroeville 
Mall from campus on April 5 
and will provide the service 
again on April 19 and April 26. 
Should the program be suc
cessful this semester, Carnegie 
Express will be available to 
students in the fall.
We hope to provide a mecha
nism for students to get out 
and about in the Pittsburgh 
area, said Jennifer Church, 
assistant to the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs and coordinator 
of the Carnegie Express.
Several students had sug
gested to the Dean of Student 
Affairs, Michael Murphy, that 
a chartered bus would be a 
useful service. I think stu
dents had a good idea, and I
am glad we were able to make it 
happen, said Murphy.
Brenden Mielke, a junior in
dustrial management major who 
assisted in coordinating the 
project, said, I think that it 
meets a need that students have 
expressed for some time. Trans
portation to surrounding areas 
is sometimes difficult/costly.
The shuttle, which runs from

Murphy decided that Student

was able to develop a plan that 
was cost-effective, so we went 
for it, he said.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP)  Mindblowing pictures of large icebergs on 
the surface of Jupiters frozen moon 
Europa are tantalizing scientists with 
the possibility theyve found evidence 
of a dynamic ocean, which could have 
spawned life at some point. The closeup 
pictures taken by the unmanned 
Galileo spacecraft during a Feb. 20 
flyby have scientists more eager than 
ever to explore the icy moons interior. 
Their enthusiasm was palpable 
Wednesday as those images, includ
ing an animated video, were released 
at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
It looks as though we found the 
smoking gun that points at this sub
surface ocean, said Michael Carr, a 
geologist with the U.S. Geological 
Survey. These are really mind-blowing pictures, said Richard Terrile, 
an astronomer at the JPL. How of
ten is an ocean discovered? ... There 
is very strong evidence that there is 
an ocean here.
The pictures of icy chunks scattered 
like pottery shards provide the 
clearest evidence to date there is liq
uid water and melting close to the 
surface of Europa, said Torrence 
Johnson, the Galileo project scientist 
at JPL, but we have no evidence di
rectly bearing on life.
Carr said the icy blocks, 
each about two to four miles 
across and resembling ice
bergs seen at the poles here 
on Earth, appeared to have 
drifted apart. You can 
push them back together 
to reconstruct the original 
pattern, he said. Their 
movement adds weight to 
scientists notion that a 
relatively warm watery or 
slushy layer underlies a 
frozen crust that could be 
anywhere from one to 60 
miles thick.
In the 20-mile-by-25-mile 
Europa snapshot, the ice 
probably is slightly more 
than a mile thick, said Paul Geissler, 
a University of Arizona planetary sci
entist. The ice surface is also rela
tively young, at about one million 
years, said Clark Chapman, a plan
etary scientist with the Southwest Re
search Institute in Boulder, Colo.
Oceanographer John Delaney of 
the University of Washington said 
the water on Europa is probably rich 
in salt and other dissolved chemi
cals from millennia of interaction 
with rocks and was spiked by incom
ing comets with the organic mol
ecules necessary for life.
Asked if the watery soup could hold 
life, Terrile said, The waters prob
ably bouillon, but we dont know if its 
chicken soup.
During the news conference, an in
ternational group of scientists was 
meeting across town to discuss a pro
posed ice-penetrating robotic craft that 
might be able to explore Europa. They 
plan to test the cryobot first at Lake 
Vostok, a freshwater lake beneath the 
ice of Antarctica. The 4.5-foot-long, 6- 
inch-diameter probe would carry a 
small, tethered submersible vessel that 
would emerge when it sensed water 
and could radio back a chemical analy
sis of what it found.
Delaney, who looks at life near seafloor volcanoes, was enthusiastic about 
such a mission. Asked if the latest 
pictures were enough to convince him 
theres life on Europa, Delaney gave

two answers. Speaking as a scientist, 
he said NASA and oceanographers 
could design experiments to answer 
the question. Then, speaking from his 
heart, he said, Im sure theres life.
Microsoft plans to 
purchase WebTV
LAS VEGAS (AP)  Microsoft Corp. 
is betting that its $425 million planned 
purchase ofWebTV Networks Inc., whose 
devices let people cruise the Internet 
from their TV sets, will spur the merg
ing of personal computers and televi
sions. Through their efforts ... we hope 
to dramatically accelerate the merger of 
the Internet and television, said 
Microsofts senior vice president, Craig 
Mundie, announcing the deal Sunday at 
the National Association of Broadcast
ers convention.
Microsoft, which already has a $5 mil
lion stake in the Palo Alto, Calif., com
pany, intends to operate it as a separate 
subsidiary, Mundie said. You can ex
pect some Microsoft technologies to show 
up in the future of WebTV, he added in 
an interview. Microsofts announcement 
comes as the computer industry and 
existing TV set makers race to define 
what the next generation of digital TV 
sets will look like.
The prize: $150 billion in spending 
needed to replace the existing 220 mil
lion analog TV sets in the United States.
Microsoft, Intel Corp., and Compaq 
Computer Corp., which have jointly de
veloped technical specifications for digi
tal PC-TVs, are at the NAB convention 
trying to woo broadcasters.
The companies executives predict that 
by next year there will be PC-TVs on the 
market, capable of receiving digital tele
vision, which will not be much more 
expensive than existing personal com
puters.
Joe Flaherty, senior vice president of 
science and technology for CBS, said TV 
stations will each have to spend from $1 
million to $2.5 million for new equip
ment to provide digital television, in
cluding high definition.If you dont do 
it, youll go out of business, he claimed.
Last week, the Federal Communica
tions Commission cleared the way for 
broadcasters to begin offering moviequality digital television to the Ameri
can public. Most importantly, the ac
tion means that after 2006, the exist
ing analog system of broadcasting dies. 
That means people will either have to 
go out and buy expensive digital TV 
sets or converters for existing analog 
sets to work.
Because it is more efficient than exist
ing analog technology, digital gives 
broadcasters the ability to cram more 
services in their same-sized slice of the
airwavesfor instance, a pay-per-view 
sports channel or stock quotes to laptop 
computers. That is the route Microsoft, 
Intel, and Compaq are pushing TV sta
tions to take. Digital TV has got to be 
more than pretty pictures, Mundie said. 
But stations that provide the next step 
up, high definition, will not' have as 
msich extra space. , , -Space station 
delayed until 98
WASHINGTON (AP)  NASA told 
the U.S. Congress Wednesday that 
Russias failure to meet its commitment 
to build a vital component of the inter
national space station will delay the 
start of construction by about 11 months. 
The first construction flight, scheduled 
for November, will be no later than Oc
tober 1998, station boss Wilbur C. 
Trafton told a House subcommittee.
I have spent the last four years 
hoping that I would not have to utter 
the words I told you so, but I think 
that day has finally come, said Rep. 
F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., chair
man of the House Science Committee. 
The participation of Russia in the sta
tion program, he said, has resulted in 
empty promise after empty promise, 
broken pledge after broken pledge, de
lay after delay. Russia is a partner in 
the space station program along with 
the United States, the European Space 
Agency, Japan, and Canada.
With U.S. funding, Russia built a space 
tug that was to have been the first ele
ment of the station. That module is ready 
to go, as is the second module built by 
the United States. But the third ele
ment, a service module that was to house 
crews and provide steering capability, 
has not been started.
Russia has missed a number of devel
opment milestones for their contribu
tions to the international space station 
due to funding shortfalls, Trafton said. 
Delivery of the service ihodule has teen 
delayed from April to December 1998. 
The delay has been predicted for 
months, but this was the first official 
announcement that the construction 
start was being delayed. The station 
was to have been completed and perma
nently manned by 2002, but that comple
tion date obviously will slip, too.
And the United States is modifying an 
existing system built by the U.S. Naval 
Research Laboratory that will provide 
command and steering functions, as well 
as the ability to raise the station to 
higher orbit.
Trafton said NASA will ask Congress
for permission to divert $200 million 
from the space shuttle program to the 
revisions. That way, he said, the United 
States can move ahead with reduced 
reliance on the Russians.
Sensenbrenner, who spoke before 
Trafton, added, Plainly put, NASA and 
the White House seem prepared to pay 
any price to keep the Russians in the 
program. The program is falling apart 
because of the Russians. I am angry that 
NASA and the White House seem pre
pared to whistle past the graveyard.
Mobutu plans to 
meet rebel leader
KINSHASA, Zaire  Under pressure 
from Western allies and eastern rebels, 
President Mobutu Sese Seko indicated 
for the first time Saturday he would be 
willing to meet face to face with rebel 
leader Laurent Kabila. Such a meeting 
has been one of the key demands of 
Kabilas rebels, who have captured 
nearly half of Zaire in their seven-month 
rebellion to overthrow Mobutus nearly 
32-year dictatorship. Recently,however, 
they have indicated they will only be 
satisfied with Mobutus resignation.
Mobutu was also stung this week by 
the abandonment by traditional West
ern allies, which no longer need him to 
thwart Soviet expansionism and are in
creasingly embarrassed by the corrup
tion of his regime. Belgium and the 
United States have intensified pressure 
on hiin to resign. But he said today he 
wont go into exile. On Friday, even 
Franceperhaps Mobutus most stead
fast Western supportersuggested the 
president meet with Kabila. It was the 
closest France has come to suggesting 
Mobutus days are numbered.
Earlier this week, Mobutu named 
Likulia Bolongo, a four-star general, his 
prime minister in the hopes that its not 
too late to rehabilitate the tattered army. 
Likulia,"Zaires third-prime minister in 
two weeks, named a new Cabinet on 
Friday, promising to rebuild the army 
and bring back order and discipline to a 
government under rebel siege.
There have been few real concessions 
to Western demands for greater human 
rights. Mobutu has declared a state of 
emergency, banning demonstrations and 
promising a crackdown on a disloyal 
press. Likulia says he wants to restore 
order. He said Saturday there would be 
no more street demonstrations.
Mobutu dismissed Western criticism 
of his authoritarian rule, saying, I am 
not a Western colony.
Further violence erupts in Hebron following funeral of Arab youth
 HEBRON, West Bank (AP)  In the 
West Banks worst violence in months, 
Jewish seminary students shot and killed 
a Palestinian, sparking fierce riots in 
which Israeli troops killed two Palestin
ians and injured dozens in Hebron, where 
500 Jewish settlers live in uneasy coex
istence with 130,000 Palestinians.
< The rioting in Hebron raged for more 
tkan five hours Tuesday, with hundreds 
of protesters hurling stones and fire
bombs at the Israelis, who fired back 
tear gas and rubber bullets.
 In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu called for Israeli secu
rity forces and Palestinian police to co
operate in restoring calm and warned 
that one more major terrorist attack 
could scuttle the peace process.
Palestinian police tried to prevent the 
protests from spilling over from the Palestinian-controlled part of the city into 
the enclave still held by Israel, where 
the shooting occurredonly to be pelted 
with stones by their own people.
Although Tuesdays fighting was the 
bloodiest, Palestinians and Israeli sol
diers have battled in the streets of the 
West Bank almost daily since Israel 
broke ground March 18 for a housing
project in east Jerusalem, the sector 
Palestinians want as their capital.
Yacoub Julani, 16, died in surgery 
with the metal kernel of a rubber bullet 
lodged in his brain. Later, 3,000 people 
attended his funeral, some crying out 
Rebel! and God is great.
A 24-year-old man wounded in the 
clashes died after hours in a coma, also 
from a rubber bullet that pierced his eye 
and brain, hospital workers said.
The crowds of angry protesters dis
banded late Tuesday afternoon. Spo
radic stone-throwing continued into 
the evening, when more than 700
people marched in the fu
neral procession of the first 
shooting victim.
The body, wrapped in a Pal
estinian flag, was carried to 
the grave by uniformed Pales
tinian police, who fired a 21- 
gun salute. The mourners 
waved Palestinian flags and 
banners, and shouted down 
Palestinian Transportation 
Minister Ali Qawasmeh when 
he tried to speak. They yelled, 
Let the olive branch fall  
and the gun rise!

1972  Presidential hopeful 
Edmund Muskie kicked off his 
Pennsylvania primary drive by 
officially opening his Pittsburgh

scene at the Fourth Street head
quarters to be a part of the bustle.
People toted signs with such 
catchy phrases as, Only Muskie 
can beat Nixon and sported but
tons reading, succintly, Muskie.
Muskie never got the chance 
to run against Nixon, as George 
McGovern eventually became 
the Democratic candidate arid 
was defeated at the polls by 
Nixon by one of the largest 
margins recorded.
TEN YEARS AGO, April 14, 
1987  Excessive crowds and 
numerous fights forced Sgt. Sima 
of campus security to close Mid
way half an hour early. Most of 
the incidents were mere punch
ing matches, but others were re
ally nasty.
A black female not affiliated 
with CMU was attacked with a 
ten-inch butcher knife by a group 
of other black females.
In another incident, a group of 
fraternity men harrassed and 
then fought with another group 
of men, leading to a brawl. One
student received a broken nose, 
and several arrests were made 
afterward. Contrastingly, the 
next night, a Saturday, went well. 
All told there were nine arrests 
made during the 1987 Carnival.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 13, 
1992  Carnival featured con
troversy due to an explicit frater
nity party poster featured on 
Sigma Alpha Epsilons booth. A 
group of female Chatham Col
lege students gathered in front of 
the booth to protest the poster 
which read Thar She Blows! 
and implied that the woman on 
the poster was giving a whale in 
a bathtub fellatio.
The women wore tape over their 
mouths and remained silent. In
stead, they let their t-shirts and 
signs, which read, This is offen
sive to women. We will not toler
ate it and Why do we have brains 
if we can only use our tongues? 
do the talking. One of the protest
ors said that they had taped their 
mouths shut to symbolize the sen
timent that, if were too busy 
performing fellatio, we cant 
speak our intelligent minds.
ONE YEAR AGO, April 15, 
1996  The campus mourned 
the unexpected loss of Senior Vice 
President Edward R. Schatz who 
died at the age of 74.
Schatz, who had been teaching 
a class on the History of CMU 
and managing the construction 
of the University Center, in the 
words of Stecen L. Calvert, origi
nally came to the University as a 
freshman in 1939 and never left.

Senate faces GSA controversy
GSA, from page 1
san effort over the past year, said 
Murphy. My sense is that the princi
pal concern of undergraduate and 
graduate students is the same, notably 
to be fairly represented by their peers.
Senate has tended to be most involved 
in issues of concern to undergraduate 
students, deferring to GSA to deal with 
issues dominantly of concern to gradu
ate students, he said.
Graduate students, for a while, have 
been unhappy with the way they think 
they are represented in Senate. They 
feel Senate does not serve the needs of 
graduate students, said Catherine 
Senderling, Senate chair and a second 
year masters student in H. John Heinz 
III School of Public Policy and Manage
ment. The Senate does not work as a 
representative for both undergraduates 
and graduates. The spirit of the pro
posal should be that we are separate 
entities who have a lot of similarities 
and differences and where we are simi
lar, we can work together, she said.
If we have two voices that are better 
informed and they say the same mes
sage, the administration would get 
much stronger. If you divide govern
ment effectively, you can strengthen 
it, said Rob Rumpf, a junior electrical 
and chemical engineering major and a 
Senate representative on the commit
tee, who originally opposed the pro
posal. When the discussion about the 
needs of GSA was brought up, I doubted 
the efficiency of GSA as an adequate 
representive body. But when I watched 
how [GSA] operated, they seemed to 
have their act together and I began to 
question why I objected to graduates 
having a separate government, he said.
The committee has been working on 
amendments and changes for the pro
posal since early December. A forum 
was also held in February for Senate 
representatives to voice their views and 
suggestions regarding the proposed 
changes.
People at the forum never said any
thing and then they didnt pass [the 
proposal], Senderling said.
There was consensus and tacit ap
proval by Senate and GSA. There were 
no major objections, said 
Shankavaram. The lack of voiced oppo
sition to the proposal has led Senate 
representatives to speculate about why 
the proposal was turned down.
Senderling suggested that two main 
points of the proposal, fair representa
tion of graduate students in campus 
affairs and funding for both organiza
tions, may have contributed to its fail
ure to pass Senate.
The proposal recognizes GSA as the 
body of governance for graduate stu
dents and establishes the Joint Fund
ing Committee, composed of under
graduates and graduates, who would 
work together to determine how to allo
cate the Activities Fee. In addition, the 
proposal outlines a new role similar to 
the student body president, only this 
individual would preside over the gradu
ate student population.
Two or three people had philosophi
cal reasons for rejecting the proposal. 
They thought GSA should make an ef
fort to be a part of Senate. I think part 
of it was also the fact that the proposal 
was complicated and when things are 
more complicated, people tend to take 
the safer route, Rumpf said.
GSA is considering administrative 
intervention in order to resolve the is
sue. The option of administrative in
tervention is a very viable option. We 
will proceed with that if we really need 
to, Shankavaram said. We will not 
accept no as answer. Either [Senate] 
goes through the formal process to re
consider or we seek administrative in
tervention, he said.
Many students, however, have ex
pressed mixed emotions towards this 
possibility. The benefit of administra
tive intervention is that it would force 
Senate to recognize the needs of gradu
ates but the liability is that it threatens 
student sovereignty, Rumpf said.
I think having the administration 
intervene with student government is
sues sets a dangerous precedent. We, 
as students, should be able to work 
things out without administrative in
tervention. Thats our responsibility.
Sometimes, however, the administra
tion feels a responsibility to intervene 
in matters where one group does not 
feel it is being represented fairly by the 
current system, said Bryon Krug, stu
dent body president and a double major 
in electrical and chemical engineering 
and engineering and public policy.
I will be seeking more formally the 
input of student leaders and others to 
determine what action I may need to 
take in response to the concerns of the 
students involved, Murphy said.
Administrative intervention would 
be embarrassing. It would be taking 
student power away. We should be able 
to solve our problems, Senderling said. 
I understand where [GSA] is coming 
from. I do not want the administration 
to step in but I understand why GSA 
would ask them to.
Administrative intervention could be 
carried out in various ways. One way 
the administration could step in is by 
forcing a campus-wide referendum from 
graduate students and making that 
binding on Student Senate, Senderling 
said. If the administration uses an 
arbitration technique, that might not 
be too bad; however, if they just came 
up with a solution, that could be disas
trous, Rumpf said.
Although the possibility of adminis
trative intervention exists, administra
tion and committee members remain 
optimistic. My sense is that the stu
dents who forged this compromise reso
lution feel very positively about it and 
are still hopeful it might receive Senate 
support, Murphy said.
GSA representatives and Senators 
have put a lot of time and effort in the 
development of this proposal, and I 
think it would be really tragic if Senate 
does not approve it. The proposed gov
ernance structure offers an excellent 
opportunity for Senate and GSA to work 
closely in cooperation.
Senators now have the power to af
fect this change in a positive way, and 
that is why it is very important for the 
Senators to reconsider this decision and 
vote in favor of the proposal, 
Shankavaram said.
Administration rejects 
Senate registration plan
MAJORS, from page 1
behind the proposed changes, but we 
think the arguments in favor of the 
Senate plan are much stronger, Krug 
said.
The administration will implement 
the Academic Councils changes in the 
fall, perhaps along with on-line regis
tration, despite the Senates proposal.
According to John Papinchak, co
director of enrollment services, the 
administration has left the matter of 
priority up to the deans. What weve 
asked the deans to do is come up with 
a standard registration process, 
Papinchak stated. Weve been feed
ing them information about what we 
can code and what we cant code and 
waiting to see what they say.
The Academic and Associate Deans 
Councils have been working on the 
proposal since the 1995-96 academic 
year, at which point student and fac
ulty input suggested that people were
in favor of the Councils proposed 
changes. Were just trying to level 
the playing field for everyone, 
Grotzinger said. Thats what students 
asked us to do.
He also emphasizes, however, that 
exceptions can and will be made in the 
new system. We do want to accom
modate students who declare double 
majors, and we feel that through ex
ception handling and the registration 
system itself well be able to do that,  
he said.
The new system will also allow the 
University to collect more demand 
data than ever before, possibly lead
ing to an increase in the number of 
instructors and sections for courses 
that fill quickly.
I really believe this is going to 
work, Grotzinger said. If it doesnt 
work, then well make changes. What 
Im really pleading is give the system 
a chance.
Get out and about...
Student Affairs provides 
transportation off campus
SHUTTLE, from page 1
vide better information about what is 
available at each stop. Also, we are 
asking what the reason for use was to 
better identify the market and possible 
changes to the routes or times, said 
Mielke.
According to Church, locations with 
various shopping venues, such as the 
Monroeville Mall and the Giant Eagle 
in Squirrel Hill as a response to student 
need.
The Edgewood Town Center stop has 
been less popular than the other stops. 
A lot of people didnt know what was 
up there, said Church.
Mielke, in charge of publicity for the
service, posted on a multitude of bulle
tin boards and posted flyers around 
campus. Also, in an attempt to find a 
better name for the service, the depart
ment of Student Affairs is sponsoring a 
contest for students to enter sugges
tions for a new name.
The grand prize, a $100 gift certifi
cate to Lazarus, will be given to the 
student that comes up with the win
ning name.
The shuttle, since it is a new service, 
is still unknown to many students. Pub
licity was not great. [We] will rework 
[the publicity] before the second week
end. Hopefully, word of mouth will work 
well, said Mielke.
Crime and Incident Report
THEFT/RECOVERY, 3/22 
12:46 am  A security guard 
radioed Campus Police to stop at 
Margaret Morrison Plaza, where 
he had accosted two male CMU 
students carrying pool cues. They 
explained that they had taken 
. the sticks from Hamerschlag 
Houses lounge as a fraternity 
prank. Initially, they said they 
had been told to procure the sticks 
but later denied this. The indi
viduals were issued internal cita
tions for theft.
THEFT/RECOVERY, 3/17 
5:21 pm  Campus Police re
ceived a call from the delivery 
route person for USA Today, re
porting that the paper box from 
Resnik Hall had been removed.
Later, the police received a call 
from a man who stated that he 
believed he had found the miss
ing paper box in the Donner Hall 
basement, west laundry room. 
The delivery person was con
tacted, and he determined that 
the coin box mechanism had been 
damaged. He said that he would 
not be able to pick it up until later 
that week. Attempts to locate a 
secure area failed due to the lack 
of available space and the fact 
that the box was so heavy it 
needed two people to carry it. The 
delivery person was advised that 
Campus Police could not guaran
tee the box would still be there 
when he came to pick it up.
To this day the box still resides 
in the Donner laundry room.
UNDERAGE POSSESSION,
3/14 10:46 pm  A CMU Donner 
Hall desk attendant contacted 
Campus Police requesting assis
tance for an RA. The RA had 
observed several individuals car
rying in a few cases of beer. Offic
ers came to the room that the 
indiviuals had entered. The occu
pants admitted to carrying in the 
five cases of beer but said they
were storing it for a St. Patricks 
Day party. The beer, including 
four open cans, was disposed of.
THEFT, 3/19 3:49 pm  CMU 
police received a call reporting that 
the foosball table from the 
Morewood Gardens Recreation 
Room had been stolen. The wire 
cable that attached the table to the 
floor had been cut. Later, police 
received an anonymous tip that 
the foosball table was somewhere 
in a fraternity house. Officers went 
to the house and gave the resi
dents five minutes to produce the 
table or else a search warrant 
would be secured to search the 
house. The residents went down to 
the basement and, a few minutes 
later, returned with the table. The 
fraternity was issued a citation for 
theft.
PERSONAL INJURY, 3/31 
4:52 am  An officer responded 
to Morewood Gardens for a per
son with a cut arm. Upon arrival, 
the officer found the student with 
a four-inch laceration on his arm. 
The student stated that he and a 
friend were horsing around in 
the room with a butter knife with 
a serrated edge when he got cut.
CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 4/3
5:30 amA complaint was called 
into Campus Police. When the 
officer arrived at the Mudge 
House room, he found it flooded 
with water. The occupants of the 
room had opened the door that 
morning to see a 55 gallon plastic 
trash can filled with water pour 
into their room. Some unknown(s) 
had propped it against the door 
during the night.
THEFT, 4/3 10:31 am  An 
officer was dispatched to the Pret
zel Works in the University Cen
ter. In the second report of the 
week from the establishment, it 
was stated that a gallon of lemon
ade was again taken from the 
countertop container. There were 
no signs of forced entry despite 
the area being locked nightly. The 
lemonade was valued at $20.
OBNOXIOUS ODOR, 3/17 
7:02 pm  A student in Mudge 
House contacted Campus Police 
notifying them of a foul odor ema
nating from his neighborsrooms. 
An officer was dispatched to take 
a whiff, and reported that it was 
coming from the common area 
inside the door leading to the 
rooms and smelled something like 
a sour pile of wet clothes sitting 
for a long time.
USED CONDOMS, 3/1912:10 
pm  An officer was dispatched 
to the Pittsburgh Technology 
Center due to reports of used 
condoms sitting on the floor of 
the first floor mens room. The 
night custodian noticed them 
there originally and turned them 
over to her supervisor, who sub
sequently turned them over to 
the officer who arrived on the 
scene. After some discussion it 
was decided that the condoms be 
placed in the trash can. The plan 
was then implemented.
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tar
tan staff see the reports: the Editor-in-Chief the News Editor, and 
the staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and

Students vote for Senate representatives at elections
ELECTIONS, from page 1
elections at the regularly scheduled 
Thursday Senate meeting.
Krug will be working with Matthew 
Phelps, a sophomore electrical and com
puter engineering major, as the new vice 
president of Senate. Phelps has worked 
on various Senate projects with Krug 
and served as  senator last Spring. 
Matt and I have a strong working rela
tionship together, said Krug.
Katie Hart, the previous vice presi
dent, will be studying in New York city 
next semester and was unable to run
with Krug.
Krug has various projects lined up for 
his next term such as working with 
business services to expand the use of 
campus express to off campus locations. 
Krug also plans on working with ad
ministration to have classes canceled 
on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Noth
ing has happened so far. Im going to 
continue to push for no school on MLK 
Day, said Krug.
Krug is attempting to improve the 
link between Student Senate and the 
administration by adding student rep
resentatives to the administrative com
mittees. Better links between Senate 
and student organizations is also on 
Krugs agenda.
Jain, formerly the Funding and Rec
ognition Chair, is now the Senate Trea
surer.
His primary duties include keeping 
track of the student organization bud
gets and monitoring the activities fee. 
I think he will be very valuable, said 
Krug.
During his term as treasurer, Jain 
plans on making a recommendation to

Man has seizure 
on Carnival ride
Griffen Taft, a man not affiliated with 
CMU, had a seizure while getting off the 
Sea Ray ride last Saturday during Car
nival.
The man fell on the exit ramp. He was 
conscious but not responding. Pittsburgh 
police, Campus Police, EMS, and an 
ambulance arrived at the scene at ap
proximately 6:40 pm.
EMS officials found a medic alert card 
indicating that the man has a history of 
seizures. Accordingto Jason Pickett, the 
on-duty EMS supervisor, the paramed
ics treated the man in the ambulance to 
stabilize his condition. He was then taken 
to Mercy Hospital.
The Sea Ray remained in operation 
for the rest of Carnival. Sergeant Ricci 
from Campus Police attributed the sei
zure to the motion on the ride. A label on
the ride warns people with medical prob
lems such as seizures to abstain from 
riding the Sea Ray.
CS head earns 
esteemed award
Head of the Computer Science De
partment James H. Morris has been 
awarded the Simon Chair of HumanComputer Interaction. The award is the 
first endowded chair in the Universitys 
Human-Computer Interaction Institute 
(HCII). Key projects for the institue in
clude information visualization, wear
able computers, collaborative hardware 
and software, and Internet use in the 
home. Morris and his colleagues have 
recently developed a tool to facilitate 
collaborative writing, which is being used 
around the country as well as in Carnegie 
Mellon English classes. He was the act
ing director of the institute since it was 
established in 1994 until 1996. Moms
increase the Activities Fee. Id like to 
help campus life become better. Increas
ing the Activities Fee would allow us to 
allocate more money to student organi
zations, said Jain.
Only five percent of the student body 
voted in the elections, a slight decrease 
from 7 percent last year. I wish a lot 
more people would have voted. Five 
percent is pretty disturbing, said Krug. 
According to Krug, better publicity 
about the elections would have encour
aged a better response.
I think a lot of students dont know
the candidates. They dont know who is 
running, said Dan Tilkin, a sophomore 
double majoring in mathematics and 
computer science and the Elections 
Board chair.
Krug said, As long as people dont 
realize that Senate is doing things that 
affect them, they have no reason to 
vote. Krug has attempted to diminish 
this problem by sending out a newslet-; 
ter that explains the projects that Sen
ate is involved. Krug plans on main
taining this newsletter through his 
next term.

Program fosters 
female retention
The School of Computer Science (SCS) 
is hosting a summer program on campus 
for computer science teachers. The pro
gram is geared toward teaching the C++ 
programming language and developing 
skills to recruit and retain female stu
dents in computer science. Currently 
only 18 percent of CS majors at top 
universities are women. The Intel foun
dation and the National Science Foun
dation have given CMU a $650,000 grant 
to facilitate the program. Allan Fischer, 
the SCS associate dean for undergradu
ate education, is the program manager. 
The program will be offered in July of
1998 and 1999.

in the art department involve, said 
Salzer. While Salzer is unsure of her 
specific plans as an artist following 
graduation, she knows that she will 
definitely pursue graduate studies in 
some field of art.
Salzer was presented with her award 
at a fundraising event called A Scent

two runners-up: AndrewLewandowski, 
a student at Cazenovia College, 
Cazenovia, New York, and John

The fundraiser also featured Chanel

On a campus that is consumed 
with heavy and unyielding 
workloads, students need encour
agement to take time to relax and 
get away from the stresses 
ofacademic life.
Last weekend the administra
tion offered students an opportu
nity to get off campus with free 
trips to neighboring areas such as 
Edgewood and Monroeville. 
Carnegie Express drives students 
to shopping areas so they can have 
a change of pace, even if for only a 
few hours, to take some time off 
from problems sets amd term pa
pers.
Despite its urban location, 
CMU is an isolated campus. Stu
dents tend define their param
eters by the limits of how far 
their feet can take them (from 
Craig Street to Shadyside) and 
forget that Pittsburgh offers 
many cultural venues and rec
reational activities. By offering 
students a chance to explore the 
fcity, the administration sends 
out the message that there is 
more to an education than tests 
and required readings.
Although the shuttle only 
takes students to grocery stores 
and shopping malls right now, 
the Office of the Dean of Student 
Affairs, which sponsored the ser
vice, is planning on expanding 
to meet continued student in
put. Future destinations of 
Carnegie Express should include 
Pittsburgh highlights such as 
the Andy Warhol museum, Pitts
burgh Pirate games, Kennywood 
Theme Park, and the Buhl Plan
etarium of Science. CMU stu
dents chose to study in a bus
tling city, but often forget that 
one exists around them. If the 
shuttle includes such places on 
its itinerary, students would 
have no excuse for graduating 
with no idea of what Pittsburgh 
has to offer.
Administrators should keep in 
mind the importance of publicity 
 the shuttle will miss its mark 
and prove to be a failed effort, 
despite any intentions, if students 
dont know about it.
If Carnegie Express is success
ful, students should begin to think 
of the shuttle as they do movies 
shown in McConomy Auditorium 
or Doherty Hall. Whats playing 
in Doherty? could be replaced 
with, Wheres the shuttle going 
tonight?
Students often feel tha the ad
ministration is .not concerned 
with the social development of 
students, but by offering such a 
service the administration dis
putes this stereotype. The Of
fice of the Dean of Student Af
fairs should be commended for 
its efforts to meet the needs of 
students and for initiating pro
grams that stress the importance 
of relaxation.
Especially at CMU, where stu
dents often have a one-track mind 
when it comes to education, stu
dents need to be distracted from 
schoolwork once in a while.

A schools individual flavor is 
mostly a result of the unique ac
tivities its students engage in. 
Events like Booth and Buggy, 
Spring Carnival, and Mobot Races 
are important because they rep
resent who and what makes up 
CMU. Beaux Arts Ball is one of 
the Universitys defining student 
traditions. This is especially true 
because we pride ourselves in 
being one of the only technical/ 
research universities in the coun
try with a first-rate fine arts col
lege too. Beaux Arts has always 
been a great way to promote CFA 
and its students, and to celebrate 
the fact that CMU has such as 
(strong artistic vein.
CFAs decision to cancel Beaux 
Arts Ball constitutes a serious 
blow to one of Carnegie Mellons 
few time-honored traditions. The 
ball has been a bi-annual fixture 
on this campus for decades, 
stretching back to Carnegie Tech 
years; this will be the first time 
the ball has been canceled for any 
reason other than war.
This makes it all the more 
dissappointing that the campus 
has been denied one of its most 
lively events simply because poor 
planning and lack of communica
tion between the Beaux Arts Ball 
committee members and admin
istrators. The campus was robbed 
of an important tradition and for 
some students their only oppor
tunity to ever experience it.

Editor:
I am writing in 
response to your 
recent article 
about the vendor 
Sreevardhan (of 
Srees Foods), and his altercation with 
CMUs Dining Services (Officials re
move campus vendor, 3/10/97).
In your article, Sreevardhan made 
several allegations regarding Frank 
Fulmer. These false statements included 
accusations of physical violence, accep
tance of bribes (including the acceptance 
of alcoholic beverages), and the use of 
profanity.
I have worked with Frank for six years, 
in both Dining Services and currently as 
manager of LaPrima Espresso Carts.
I have never seen him lose his temper 
or use profanities in this time, regard
less of numerous stressful situations.
I have been in his company at social 
situations and never seen him touch a 
drop of alcohol. For him to take a bribe of 
expensive champagne is so far out of 
character as to be absurd.
All vendors on campus experience lo
gistical difficulties when beginning their 
ventures. Frank does his best to smooth 
these out and work towards solutions 
beneficial to both parties.
LaPrima has had complete satisfac
tion with both locations on campus, 
through Franks assistance.
I consider Frank Fulmer to be extremely 
good-natured and hard- working and have 
never seen him act in any other manner 
than absolute professionalism.

chology experiments in introductory Psy
chology courses.
Apparently, Mr. Lewin doesnt like 
this idea because it isnt factored into 
the average workload for units. (Nine
units = nine hours per week.) While 
reading this, one thought came to mind.
Grow up.
Does Mr. Lewin actually believe that 
all CMU courses follow the hours-perweek rate when assigning units to 
courses?
I suggest that he go talk to a CS 
major taking Operating Systems or an 
ECE major who has to spend extra 
time in lab because he or she couldnt 
get their circuit to work.
I know I spend more time than the 
units say in some courses, and less in 
others.
In the end, it works out. (Sometimes 
not; thats true as well. Take a good 
look at midsemester week some time.)
So Mr. Lewin felt like a fool while 
doing this experiment.
Good.
Now when he runs one, hell have an 
idea about how his subjects feel.
Thats the difference between real 
life and the classroom, and he should 
appreciate that the professors require 
their students to go out and experience 
it.

Heavens Gate image captures campus
The importance of Beaux Arts is 
not limited just to CFA students. 
The last ball was open to all stu
dents and represented a great 
opportunity for CMU students to 
get together and have a good time 
such events are, currently, very 
limited in number. CFAs plan 
for future Beaux Arts balls in
clude making it a less extrava
gant affair and slotting it in with 
a proposed bi-annual Jill Watson 
festival. Not only would this lump 
the maj or art-celebrations into one 
weekend every two years, but it 
would make Beaux Arts exclu
sive to CFA students again.
If the decision is justified, even 
if only in part, by CFA 
administrations fear of behav
ior at the ball and lack of proper 
security measures, then it pro
ceeds on the assumption that 
CMU students are incapable of 
mixing fun and responsibility. 
CFA administration should 
know by now that the best way 
to teach students how to mix fun 
and responsibility is to challenge 
them to do so.
Beaux Arts Ball should be re
instated as soon as possible, if 
not this semester, then certainly 
in the next one. Otherwise, there 
will be no one left who actually 
remembers what a real Beaux 
Arts Ball was like to revive it, 
keeping intact the connotations 
it now holds. Lets not let this 
tradition die.

When I heard about the Heavens Gate 
cultists, with their New-Agey, sciencefictional casserole of beliefs, their exper
tise in the ways of the Internet, and their 
complete lack of sex lives, my first 
thought was this: What were all these 
CMU students doing in a sunny Califor
nia mansion during spring break, and
how come I wasnt invited?
Its rather disconcerting if you think 
about it. The post-Waco image of a cult 
has been that of a bunch of crazies holed 
up in a compound somewhere stockpil
ing weapons to stave off doomsday or the 
federal governmentwhichever comes 
first. In other words, they resemble no 
one most of us are likely to meet in our 
lifetimes.

like people you might meet on campus, 
only several hundred times more so.
Frightening, isnt it? It almost makes 
you wonder whether something like that 
could happen here.
Yes, CMU students would presum
ably have enough common sense to real
ize that no aliens are waiting to swoop 
down behind a comet and whisk us away 
to another dimension, and that even if 
they were, such supposedly advanced 
creatures would surely figure out a way 
to do it without us going through the

we can all shake our fists at him. In other words, its very 
easy to feel righteous when the enemy is in your face.
But I know thats not where racism is at its most 
dangerous. Its in everybodys everyday lives, so ingrained 
that we dont even see it.

Though the thought of 
being faced by ignorant

didnt exactly turn me on,
I felt an obligation to attend the rally, and I was excited because it seemed like a lot 
of my peers felt the same.
What I was met with last Saturday was unnerving at best 
and nauseating at worst.
I couldnt figure out why I felt so uneasy, but for the entire 
time I was wedged between groups of protestors, I couldnt 
help but think this: Folks are worrying about this one day a

It has to take forms that 
are less obvious for us to 
lose track of it. We think 
weve solved the problem, 
and we leave rallies like the one last Saturday congratulat

neighborhoods and eat dinner with our mostly white or 
mostly black friends and forget that right there, in our 
homes and schools, is the problem.
We are still divided, and until we can come to see racism 
for what it is and deal with it everyday, fools in white bed 
sheets are going to pop up every so often to remind us.

It cant be natural for anyone 
involved with computers to work 
like that without the benefit of 
24-hour pizza places.
But if we consider those at 
Rancho Santa Fe as some kind of 
epitome of cultliness, CMU cer
tainly seems to have what it 
takes to sprout its own equally 
unusual and non-violent cult. It 
would be a great way to distin

I dont know; maybe we can 
expect people here to pledge al

UNIX or something. While 
Heavens Gate preached about 
moving qn to the Level Beyond 
Human, CMU cultists can talk 
about spirituality system up
grades. Or take the Star Wars 
Trilogy as their Bible. Oh, wait, 
they already do.
Naturally, you need a little 
more than a liking for The XFiles and the ability to design a 
good web page to subscribe to 
one of these cults. A little insan
ity probably helps.
I mean, who were these cult
ists? People who smile when they 
talk of their castrations? People 
who prepare for their imminent

member four years ago 
watching my brother stand in our kitchen with the speaker
phone on, registering for classes at UCLA with the touch of a few 
buttons. The system was simple, efficient, fast, and it saved a lot 
of people a lot of work.
I think its a bad idea.
I only came to this opinion recently, when I was on jury duty 
in January. I was lucky enough not to have been assigned to a 
case in the ten days I was scheduled to be on call. (Yes, I know 
its hard to believe  Im from L.A. and there was no trial for me 
to participate in.) The court had a new system where you called 
in twice a day, entered your group number, and a telephone 
message told you whether you were supposed to show up at court 
the following day.
This struck me as one more step towards complete automa
tion. Pretty soon, you wont have to leave your home to serve on 
jury duty. Can you imagine? Just call 777-JURY.
Hello and welcome to J uryphone! If you know the name of the 
defendant on whose trial you are serving, press one. To choose 
from a list of current defendants, press two.
If you have questions about a book contract or obtaining a 
literary agent, press three. 1.
Please enter the first three letters of the defendants last 
name, then press Pound. 6-3-6.
You have selected Ly/e Menendez and Erik Menendez. To hear 
highlights of todays testimony, press one. Or, to skip right to 
touch-tone deliberations, press two. 2.
Press one for guilty, two for not guilty, or three if you need 
time to deliberate.
Now, it might be easier for jurors to remain in their homes for 
jury duty. But, as you can see, this telephone automation would 
hardly be fair to the defendant. The same goes for telephone 
registration. Now, I agree that its a pain in the ass to wander 
around campus and get signatures from every department. But I 
enjoy it. Call me old-fashioned, but I look forward every semester 
to visiting the History office, where Naum Kats forcefully tries to 
convince me that I should be a history major because my creative 
writing major will take me nowhere. I look forward to visiting the 
H&SS lounge on pre-registration day, where a few lucky members 
of the English staff greet you with a look of supreme exhaustion 
and wait for you to bombard them with your inevitable barrage of 
questions and RAD forms.Yes, its a lot of paperwork, and its all 
rather confusing. But college without massive amounts of paper is 
like orange juice without oranges! Apple pie without apples! 
OFries without grease! In a world where automation is taking 
over, we must hold on to our traditions, our old ways.
In order to ensure this, I say we should all trade in those stupid 
touch-tone things for rotary phones.

Greek involvement should earn them campus funding
r James Stepanek
Theres an interesting subject thats been 
on peoples minds lately, that is especially 
relevant to Spring Carnival. Student Sen
ate has recently been debating whether or 
not to allow Greek organizations to receive 
funded status, and thus a portion of the 
Activity Fee. Some feel that this is wrong. 
Id have to differ. Most people on the Greek 
side say that they deserve the money be
cause of what they do for campus. Id say 
theyre wrong, too.
It is easily arguable that Spring Carni
val and the general social life of campus 
would be a barren wasteland without the 
Greeks. Of the 14 buggy organizations, 10 
are Greek. Around half of the Booth entries 
are Greek. The best parties to be found 
during Carnival (and the rest of the year) 
are all on the quad. This does not even get 
into the issue of whether or not most of the 
activities :are sustainable without Greek 
participation.
Buggy, for instance, requires quite a 
bit of manpower just to occur. There 
must be sweepers, flaggers, and a multi
tude of other details must be attended to 
for the event and its practice runs to 
happen. Without a fairly large number of 
buggy organizations, the time commit
ment from each organizations members 
would be much greater. With only the 
four remaining independent organiza
tions, there wouldnt be Buggy at all.
But, to be realistic, if the Greeks were 
removed from the scene, some equilib
rium would be attained. Maybe more 
booth and buggy organizations would 
spring up. Maybe the vacuum would be 
filled  then again maybe it would not. 
Ive noticed that independent loyalty in 
buggy tends to be a bit shallower than 
that of the fraternities. This is not to say 
that every organization doesnt have its 
fanatics, but one can notice that the 
independents wax and wane in size de
pending on their success each year. Re
member CIA? I doubt many will, since 
they died a few years ago after fading out 
in Buggy. What happened to their sup
port? They went to Spirit, Pioneers, and 
SDC. The simple truth is that indepen
dent buggy organizations are few in num
ber because there is a limited pool with 
the depth of commitment needed. The 
fraternities exist for other reasons, and 
thus are continual competitors.
So I suppose it is pretty clear that the 
subtraction of the Greeks from CMU 
would alter Carnival, but does that jus
tify Senate funding? Well, no it doesnt. 
However, there is a reason that they 
should be funded. More correctly, if any
one should be funded, they should be 
funded as well. It is simply unfair to 
make some organizations fund their com
petitors. Greeks fund their booths and 
buggies out of their own pocket, while 
independents receive Activity Fee money 
from everyones pocket.You can argue 
that anyone can join an independent or
ganization, but in an activity as competi
tive and shrouded in secrecy as Buggy, 
everyone knows thats a load of bunk. If a 
PiKA mechanic tried to join Spirit and 
see everything about their buggies, hed 
be laughed out the door. Sure, they may
let him be some form of member, but full 
membership is not an option. In a com
petitive endeavor, granting some exclu
sive organizations funding while denying 
it to others is patently unfair.
You might argue that the PiKA me
chanic is an extreme case. OK, I suppose 
it is, but what if you do join, say, Fringe 
and you rub everyone there the wrong 
way? Dont even try to lie and say that 
they wouldnt find a way to make you 
leave. Fraternities are just more honest 
and tell you outright that you cant join if 
you dont fit in. Other clubs will make you 
learn this over time. Anyone who believes 
that every independent organization will 
accept anyone is heavily medicated.
To put it simply, the only fair way to do 
this would be have either all competing 
organizations be funded, or none of them. 
Im more inclined to the latter myself, but 
if the former is more amenable to people, 
I could accept it.

Effective wur P-BP--,B all current network connections 
for students in on-campus housing will be disconnected.
Students can prevent a disruption in their networking services by pre-registering their next data outlet activation. On April 
24 and 25, 1997, between the hours of 9:00 and 4:30, by the Connan Room in the University Center, the Network Group 
will have a staff member with a computer ready to assist students in completing network pre-registrations for summer and 
fall data outlet activations. Pre-registering your next network connection assures you that an outlet activation will be ready 
and waiting in your new room when you return to campus.

 For a summer session
 For Fall semester

THEA
TO PRE-REGISTER.
Volu s2 C
Q5G1.
PRE-REGISTER?
 The building and room you will be living in next
 The phone number in that room
 What area in the room the outlet you want is located
 Information about your computer
If you cant make it April 24 and 25, there are two other ways to pre-register:
 You can use a WWW page to both obtain data outlet numbers 
and submit your pre-registration electronically. The URL is:
http://www.net.cmu.edu/reg/student.html ---- -   ~~~[
Or you can submit a paper Pre-Registration form as found in the 
Help Center, Cyert Hall A50. Only completed forms will be processed.
 Pre-registration is not mandatory; its just a good idea 
that can save students from waiting for an outlet activa
tion during the busiest time of the year. The Network 
Group received over 1200 activation requests last 
fall, sometimes at a rate of 300 per week. This can 
lead to a significant delay to process a network 
activation. Network Group can keep that delay to 
a minimum by making connections before stu 
dents arrive, and have an active outlet waiting 
for you if you pre-register.
Starting the week of MAY 19,1997, 
the Network Group will begin to activate summer pre-registrations.

My mom's been raising 
me all by herself. She doesn't 
have much money. Sometimes 
she's so busy. She bought me a 
whole bunch of new dollies.
She left them on my bed on 
Friday afternoon.
I really appreciated it so I 
left her a note on the kitchen 
table before I went camping for 
the weekend.
" Thanks for everything.
Goodbye."
She thought it was a suicide 
note and went crazy crying all 
over the neighborhood, and 
calling everyone on Ihephone.
Me and my friends 
thought it was funny.
Sometimes she is so funny.

Track team tunes
up for UAAs at IUP
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
The earliest runners wore no clothes. 
Thank Zeus for Nike shorts, because the 
earliest runners wouldnt have made it 
in the harsh 20 degree conditions that 
faced the CMU track team at the Indi
ana University of Pennsylvania meet 
last Saturday.
[The meet] was all in a driving rain; it 
didnt let up at all, said Coach Dario 
Donatelli. I was happy [with the teams 
performance.]
My whole bag and everything in it 
was soaked after ten minutes outside,
winning height was 13 feet 6 inches, a 
height Rikowski can normally clear.
However, senior Ron Polcawich gave 
an able performance in the difficult 
steeplechase, placing third in 10:00 min
utes.
Sophomore Maureen McGranaghan 
won the 3,000-meter rim with a time of 
10:44. Junior Yumiko Yamada placed 
first in the high jump at five feet.
[This] was another tune-up meet, 
getting ready for conference champion
ships, said Donatelli. CMU will host 
UAA championships on the weekend of 
April 26-27.
The team also made thunderous

Crew hits water, women to open at Capitol Classics
JBy PAUL BOOTHE
[Tartan Personnel Manager
1 Despite poor water-conditions, 
^.the CMU Crew team has been 
| preparing for the spring sprint 
\ season with rigorous indoor train| ing and an intense spring break 
training session. Yesterday sigj naled the beginning of this sea| son, as the team competed against 
;Duquesne University, John 
Carroll University, Case West; em Reserve University, andhostj ing school University of Pitts
burgh. CMU fielded a mens Var
sity-Four, Novice-Four, and Nov
ice-Eight squad. Coach Cassa 
Hadley said, Were really proud 
to be fielding a Novice MensEight this season  [it is] the 
first one in awhile.
The weather was really bad, 
said Hadley. According to the 
coach, the meet was supposed to 
feature 2,500-meter sprints in the 
river, but the weather forced meet 
organizers to run 1,000-meter 
sprints in a channel. The chan
nel only allows two boats across, 
which would affect the outcomes, 
said Hadley. Varsity-Four was 
, third with 3:02, but the two teams
ahead of them  who finished in 
2:54 and 2:57had the opportu
nity to race against each other. 
The Novice-Four was also third 
at 3:04. The mens Novice-Eight 
was part of an exciting race with 
Pitt. [They were] well in the lead, 
but someone lost their seat, said 
Hadley. The team came in sec
ond, by half a second, to Pitt in 
2:54.
The Varsity-Four boat is 
coxswained by sophomore A1 
Klein, with rowers senior Ben 
Fry, junior Klaus Moser, junior 
JefFWiley, and senior Peter Moore 
filling the position of the injured 
sophomore Julian Kinal. The 
Novice-Four is coxswained by 
sophomore Amy Ng, with rowers 
sophomore Brendan Howell, 
freshman Jeff Beene, sophomore 
Darius Rad, and freshman Greg 
Niejadlik. The Novice-Eight 
squad has the same five novices, 
along with freshman Adam 
DiCaprio, sophomore Martin 
Richards, freshman Tim 
Machuga, and sophomore cox
swain Joanne Wei.
Besides being the start of the 
season, this scrimmage was im
portant because it gave the team
a sense of where they stood 
against the local competition.
The spring races are 2,000- 
meter sprints where teams line 
up six across and race for the 
finish line  whoevers bow 
crosses the finish line first wins. 
This is a big difference from the 
fall head races, which are 5,000- 
meter endurance runs where 
teams race against the clock for
the fastest time. Spring races can 
be intense, as they typically last 
six to eight minutes depending 
on the crew and water conditions, 
and the team can see where the 
competition is at all times.
Although the team was not able 
to get on the water at all from 
Thanksgiving to spring break, the 
team was still busy preparing for 
the season. Its been a pretty 
basic winter, said Hadley. Weve
put in all of the basic components 
to be able to win races in the 
spring. The rowers do a lot of 
weight-training and cross-train
ing to keep in shape and build 
muscle. A huge part of the winter 
training is working on the indoor 
rowing machines, or erg ma
chines. This gets hard on the en
tire team, however, because by 
the end of the winter, the rowers
start to get sick of the indoor 
training, and the coaches begin 
to run out of activities to have 
them do. By the end, Hadley says, 
it [gets] to the point where 
everyones real itchy to get back 
on the water. At the end of the 
winter training, Hadley said ev
eryone had made some real 
progress in strength and condi
tioning, but really needed to work 
on moving a boat in the water.
The crew team finally got their 
chance to hit the water over spring 
break, when they held approxi
mately five days of six to eight 
hours of rowing a day in a whirl
wind training session. There they 
concentrated on re-acclimating 
themselves to the water and ac
tually rowing, and then they 
moved on to working on tech
nique and racing strategies. 
Hadley said, We were set up to 
start the season when spring 
break was over.
The team has been fortunate 
this year to have a focused novice 
group that started with the team 
in the winter, which Hadley says 
takes a lot of dedication. This will 
lead to a strong Novice squad 
next semester because they can 
learn how to row now so that they 
will be ready to compete from day 
one next semester, said Hadley. 
We are really happy with the 
way that they are up-and-com
ing.
With this scrimmage, the team 
has kicked off the short spring 
season. April 20 will be the 
womens season opener as both 
teams compete in the Capitol 
Classics in Washington, D.C.,
hosted by Catholic University. 
This will be a new race for the 
team, but expectations are high. 
We should fare pretty well there, 
Im anticipating, said Hadley. 
Its a race geared for smaller 
programs like ours. On Satur
day, April 26, the crew squads 
will travel to the Governors Cup 
in Charleston, West Virginia, fol
lowed by the Mid-Atlantic Cham
pionship on the Occoquan in Vir
ginia on the following weekend. 
Hadley said, This is the race we 
look to hit our stride at. All of the 
squads will compete at this race, 
and it will mark the end of the 
season for many of the teams.
The best crews will finish the 
season at the Dad Vail in Phila
delphia from May 8-10. Hadley 
calls this race the most presti
gious race we go to all year. 
There, they will compete against 
some of the strongest schools 
within their level of competition
 schools like Temple, Michi
gan, Drexel, Army, and 
Georgetown. Approximately 150 
schools will be sending their best 
squads to this race. Hadley said, 
This race is what everyone has 
been building to all season.
We should fare pretty well there, Im 
anticipating... its a race geared for 
smaller programs like ours.

two games canceled last week. The Track Team has three meets in the next 
two weeks. CMUs Rugby Club will scrum again this weekend after almost 
a month off.said junior Rick Rikowski. Despite the 
rain, both the mens and womens teams 
generally fared well at the meet.
Junior Nathan Gill placed second in 
400-meter intermediate hurdles at the 
meet with a time of 58.7 seconds. It 
wasnt too bad actually, it was just harder 
to warm up, said Gill. Some people just 
ran in circles in the gym.
According to the hurdler, although it 
was raining, the weather in general 
was better than the teams Wednesday 
meet at Bethany, West Virginia. The 
rain seemed to create problems for some 
field events, especially the pole 
vault.The weather definitely affected 
them, said Gill.
It slowed down the bus ride, said 
Rikowski, who no-heighted for the sec
ond consecutive meet. Well, we got there 
at 11:55, the pole vault started at 12, so 
that was that. The pole vaulter takes 
an abnormally long amount of time to 
warm up, usually about 45 minutes. The

more Kristo Kriechbaum (15:35), fresh
man Kenn Oldham (15:37), and senior 
Seb Zeisler (15:48) placed third, fourth, 
and fifth respectively in the mens 5K. 
Senior Becky Buchheit rolled, fully 
clothed, into first place with a time of 
19:07 in the womens 5,000-meters.
Grave misfortune has also stuck the 
team: freshman Dave Shafer injured his 
foot. Also, junior Peter Hunt came down 
with a nefarious bug and was unable to 
compete in the high jump. Donatelli 
doubts that Shafer will be able to com
pete in the upcoming meets on Wednes
day at Robert Morris or next week, 
again at IUP. I know that [Shafer] 
has begun to run again, said Donatelli. 
Hunts condition is unknown.
The team did well, considering the con
ditions. They kept warm and maintained 
high speeds. Imagine, if you will, the wind 
chill if they had all gone in the buff. Its a 
striking and forlorn picture.

Life's a Sport
By Chris Cannon
This weekend, Tiger Woods made 
history in stylish fashion; becoming 
the first African-American, the first 
Asian-American, and youngest player 
ever to win the Masters. On top of 
that, he did i t with style, with a record 
breaking 12 stroke margin of victory 
and a shooting a 270 four-day- total on 
the course, another record. Earlier in
that mostly he just stole stuff from 
him that may one-day (like next week) 
be price-less collectables. When I re
alized how corrupt and shallow he 
was, I stooped to insults. Mostly I 
reminded him of how much money 
Tiger is going to eventually donate to 
the school after the guy graduates.
After you tire of this, I challenged 
him to a game of basketball, just so I 
could say I played against a Division I 
athlete (even if it wasnt in his scholar
ship sport). The 5 foot 9 inch Asian 
golfer with love-handles that plays 
with his glasses on fared surprisingly 
well. Mostly I pondered whether Tiger 
would be any better at hoops.
What sort of athlete is Tiger Woods 
anyway? Recently, prominent report
ers on ESPN compared his accom
plishments to the young Mike Tyson, 
Magic Johnson, and even Lew 
Alcindor. They used superlatives such
"So whats its like to talk to someone 
who played with Tiger Woods?
the semester, I had the rare priviledge, 
not of talking with Woods himself, but 
with one of his former golf-mates at 
Stanford University.
So instead of the usual drivel where 
a column is a tertiary rant on pro
sports or world-famous athletes, this 
will actually be a secondary source. I 
talked to a guy who played with the 
Tiger! (The players name is with-held 
to protect the guilty.)
So whats its like to talk to someone 
who played with Tiger Woods? Mostly 
its boring. Thrilling at first, like the 
beginning of The English Patient, but 
(like the rest of The English Patient) 
very, very boring. You may be inter
ested to know that Tiger Woods never 
hit a hole-in-one in college.
You find out things, like the fact that 
this guy never beat Tiger, not once and
as prodigy, (a title usually reserved 
for violinist) master, (a compliment 
typically given to a few chess-players 
in the world) and even lauded him as 
possibly the Michael Jordan of the 
21st century (a mantle almost exclu
sively placed on basketball players).
The one question I wanted to ask 
the guy who played the links with the 
Tiger is: Who is Tiger Woods?
The anti-christ to the good-ol* boys 
game of golf, the sports messiah, or 
just some guy who had his first club 
before his first birthday and can ac
curately drive a golf-ball over 335 
yards, on average? Oh, I never really 
got toknow him, said my source. And 
I dont think we ever will.

Hockey needs a hip-check rule
On the Net
By Chris Adukaitis
There has been much debate around 
the NHL recently regarding the hipcheck. For those of you not familiar 
with hockey terminology, a hip-check 
occurs when a defenseman uses his hip 
or rear-end to check an opposing player 
between his waist and his knees. The 
manuveur bears a similarity to methods 
used in football, notably to the chopblock utilized by offensive linemen and 
the technique that defenders  
especially the smaller ones  
use to tackle. Although it is dif
ficult to execute, the hip-check 
is a very effective way of stop
ping the opposing player, 
especially when near the 
boards.
The problem that some play 
ers and coaches have with 
the hip-check is that 
defensemen are more fre
quently aiming for the 
knees of forwards, some
times dropping to their 
knees or all fours to trip 
up the opponent. This can 
be very dangerous  
sending the forward 
head-over-heels, taking 
his legs out, or (much the same 
as in football) blowing out a 
knee.
Proponents of the hip-check claim 
that it is a necessary weapon to defend 
against todays bigger, stronger players. 
Its much easier to take out someone of 
Eric Lindross stature if you hit him low 
and dont stand up. Ask any football 
coach; you gotta aim low. I agree, but 
not the knees.
Another factor for keeping the
hip-check is that it has been in the game 
for as long as anyone can remember. 
Proponents will tell you that if you take 
it out, you might as well stop the fight
ing. They may well both be large parts of 
hockey, but rarely does someone suffer 
an injury that is season-ending (much 
less one that 
ends a ca
reer) from a 
fight.
Which 
leads to the 
reason the 
hip-check 
should be
Its much easier to take out 
someone of Eric Lindross 
stature if you hit him low and 
dont stand up.
NHL playoffs were finalized.
This years Stanley Cup champions

Eastern Conference:

Dominali 
Hasek, the: 
Montreal' 
Canadiens 
(8) who 
havent! 
shown much' 
life all seaj
outlawed: intent to injure. The intent to 
injure is why the NFL has outlawed 
chop-blocks from behind and levies fines 
against deliberate shots at the knees. 
That is what it basically comes down to 
when guys like Ulf 
Samuellsson and Darius 
Kasparaitis pin a players 
legs against the boards or 
knock his feet out from unhim. They are
part in 
sport.
any
/S
son. Buffalo (2) should have no trouble 
with newcomers Ottawa (7). If its not a 
sweep, the Senators will be lucky. At 
least they finally made it into the play
offs.
The Philadelphia Flyers (3) and Pitts
burgh Penguins (6) should be a greatij 
series. The problem is, contrary to t 
mid-season hype following rookie Patrick! 
Lalime, the Penguins dont have any! 
defense or a goalie. When Hextall isi 
trying to take playing stupid, the Flyers arent much!! 
that player off better off, but at least they have some; 
the ice, perma- blue-liners. Philly will win in six or seven 
nently. And games. The Florida Panthers (4) meeti 
that brand of the New York Rangers (5) for the first' 
play has no time ever in the playoffs. Johfli 
Vanbiesbrouck and the trapping Pani> 
thers will try and stop Gretzky, Messier,j 
and Leetch from lighting the lamp. De^ 
fense wins championships, as well as! 
playoff series, so Im gonna have to goi 
with the Panthers on this one.
Playoff
predictions:
After this 
weekends 
games, the 
match
ups for 
this 
years
The Stanley Cup Finals:
The Devils will survive the Panthers' 
and the Flyers will up-end the Sabres!' 
So what really matters is that Philly will 
have to face Jersey in the Finals for thq1 
chance to dethrone the Avalanche.

"Conflict As Graced Opportunity"
Susan Stangl, Ph.D.
Adjunct Professor, St. Vincent Seminary 
Retreat Director, St. Paul's Retreat Center
Conflict is experienced at some time 
and to some degree in the life of 
every person. It is a fact of life. 
This evening's presentation will focus 
on conflict in the workplace 
as a graced opportunity for growth in 
both spiritual and professional life. 
Consideration will be given to the 
crisis of meaning and the opening to 
creative possibility which working-life 
conflict occasions, depending upon 
the perspective one brings.

Swim teams earn honors
The CMU mens and womens swim 
teams received Academic All-America 
honors from the College Swimming 
Coaches Association of America 
(CSCAA) for their classroom perfor
mance during the 1996 fall semester.
To earn Academic All-America hon
ors, a team must earn a combined gradepoint average of 2.8 (on a 4.0 scale) or 
better. The men had a 3.10 grade-point 
average, which ranked 11th in NCAA 
Division III. The womens team earned 
a 2.93 to rank 42nd.
De la Hoya outpoints Whitaker
Oscar de la Hoya used a methodical 
attack and displayed many of the skills 
that make him what many regard as 
boxings best fighter to easily outpoint 
Pemell Whitaker and capture the 
World Boxing Council welterweight 
title tonight at Las Vegas.
De la Hoya remained unbeaten, im
proving to 24-0, and while he didnt 
rely on his trademark power punches 
to hurt Whitaker, he did enough to 
win all three judges scorecards.
Judge Chuck Giampa had the bout 
115-111, while Dalby Shirley and 
Jerry Roth scored it, 116-110.
Tiger Woods wins by 12 strokes
Tiger Woods became the first African-American to win a major champi
onship and the youngest to capture the 
Masters, walking away with a recordsetting 12-stroke victory at the Augusta 
National Golf Club in Georgia.
Woods 18-under-par 270 set a 72- 
hole course record and completed his 
devastating mastery of fabled Augusta 
National, which has tormented play
ers twice his age with 20 times his 
experience. The 12-stroke victory mar
gin is the largest ever at the Masters, 
shattering the previous record of 9, 
setin 1965 by JackNicklaus, the player 
whose legacy Woods seems ready to 
inherit. Tom Kite was second for the 
third time at Augusta, carding a 2- 
under 70 today to finish 6-under.
Cubs tie mark for losses
A miserable start for the Chicago 
Cubs reached landmark proportions in 
against the Atlanta Braves at Wrigley 
Field. The Cubs tied the modem Na
tional League record for losses to start 
a season with a 6-4 loss to the Atlanta 
Braves Sunday.
The Cubs are 0-10, tying the NL 
modem day record set by the Braves in 
1988. The all-time league mark is 0-11, 
set by the Detroit Wolverines in 1884. 
The major league record of 0-21 was set 
by the Baltimore Orioles in 1988.
Painkillers used widely in NFL
At least 10 percent of National Foot
ball League players reportedly are 
addicted to painkillers.
The New York Times reported that 
the use of painkillers is so widespread 
that some players hoard hundreds of 
pills and even trade tickets to NFL 
games with pharmaceutical workers to 
get their share ofthe drugs. Some spend 
weeks or months in the off-season get
ting rid of their dependency and deal
ing with withdrawal symptoms.
The game is played with pain, Jim 
Kelly, theformer Buffalo Bills quarter
back who announced his retirement in 
February, told the newspaper. If you 
cant play in pain you should be playing 
golf, like Im doing a lot of now. I think 
thats the mentality of players.

Heres a season awards column with a 
theme: anagrams. See if you can un
scramble the letters before you figure 
out the star.
MVP: Rich ale jam don.
This guy not only creates his own shot, 
he assists his teammates and sets up his 
teammates for assists. Tim Hardaway 
has been the one mainstay in Miami, 
Karl Malone has done it against little 
opposition in the West, but the NBAs 
main man is Michael Jordan.
Most Improved: Ken-ran Veg-tit.
A whole host of Miami players have 
stepped up, but this years winner in
creased his scoring average (17.1 up 
from 10.4), rebounds per game (7.9 from 
4.0), assists (3.0 from 1.8), blocks (2.2 
from 1.6), steals, shot, and free-throw 
percentage: Kevin Gamett.
Sixth Man: Kadeem Hardison.
Just kidding, Rise Gal-thing. Toni 
Kukoc and John Starks are stars on 
talented teams, but we have to reward 
the effort of Chris Gatling.
Rookie of the Year: On All Ever-sin. 
In the past four games, the number one 
draft pick has given the voters 178 
(points) reasons why hes the number 
one rookie: Allen Iverson.
First Team All-NBA: In addition to

point guard not playing point guard), Hi 
L.L. Rant G (triple-double machine), 
Lame OK Narl (who puts the power in 
power forward), andMoo-leek Jawa-hun
(famous for his Dream-shake) led 
teams that this year would otherwise 
struggle to reach the post-season. (Kevin 
Johnson, Grant Hill, Karl Malone, and 
Hakeem Olajuwon respectively) 
Second Team: Honst Not-jock is still 
the best pure point. Glen Rice and Mitch 
Richmond put up gaudier numbers, but 
Lap-well Re-trells has the complete game. 
Scottie Pippen has slipped, but Sony ant 
Ham-on turned on his game after being 
traded. Lots of forwards put up big num
bers, but Sir R. Ebb Chew wins on talent 
alone. Shaq has game when healthy, 
but former Georgetown center 
Diet-mom Kum-be-bo is the de
fensive stopper with a develop
ing offense. (John Stock
ton, Latrell 
Sprewell,
Anthony 
Mason,
Chris
Webber, and 
Dikembe Mutombo)
Offensive Player 
of the year (small):
Nicer Gel. He hits from 
outside, and often too:
Glen Rice.
Offensive Player 
of the year (big):
Sir Clint Ant ate 
her. On a team 
with defensive 
stoppers, he 
provides the 
points and the 
matchup prob
lems. The wind be
neath the wings of the 
Hawks: Christian Laettner.
Defensive Player of the Year
(small): Yar-yat Pong. Mookie Blaylock 
leads in steals, but the glove is the real 
deal: Gary Payton.
Defensive Player of the Year (big): 
Hey lads, Brawn. Diet-mom Kum-be-bo 
is a force, but this winner is gaining 
respect after cutting Charles Barkley 
with a bony knee: Shawn Bradley 
Best Dribbler: The NVE (not very 
exciting) ass. Mugsey Bogues and Tim 
Hardaway have their own step, but this 
award goes to a Canadian. If only he 
didnt have two point guards 
playing in front of him: Steve 
Nash.
Most Spirited: Bap hit
sore RR. Another seven-: 
foot Chicago Bull win
ner this year. Do they 
sign these guys to 
keep them off Social 
Security? Robert 
Parish.
Most Likely to 
Succeed: Jane, a 
mere lion. Like 
last years winner, 
another high schooler, 
but not the one that first comes to 
mind. But is there room on 
Portlands talent-laden team? 
Jermaine ONeal.
Coach of the year: Le Rat Yip. 
From Showtime to Broadway to the 
beach, this guy runs a tight ship. Other 
guys have more wins, 
but nobody can 
squeeze them out 
like Pat Riley.
Chris Cannon is 
a junior CS ma
jor. His real AllNBA team would 
consist of four for
wards and Jor
dan, but nobody 
would even believe 
that, so he gave you 
expected blurb.

SWEEPSTAKES
an Contributing EditorAndrew McDermott/Tartan Contributing Editor
pirit A claims victory, rolls over
By DAWN PAPUGA
'.Tartan Staffwriter
| Late nights, early mornings, and tons 
of hard work were the prelude to the 
Sweepstakes events. Unfortunately the 
rainy weather decided not to hold off for 
ithe finals on Saturday morning, leaving 
'many of the organizations wondering 
'who really was the best. This is not to 
Isay that the day of preliminary races 
was without excitement; there were drop.'outs and upsets across the board. In the 
! end, Spirit ended PiKAs three year reign 
as champions and returned to the top for 
their seventh championship in 11 years. 
! The first heat started the excitement 
when only one of the contenders actually 
showed up at the starting line. SDC D 
,and Sigma Nu C were to get the compe
tition underway, but at the sound of the 
gun only Sigma Nu C left the start line. 
They rolled unchallenged and crossed 
-the finish line at 2:36.10.
The second heat brought the first com
petitive race with Kappa Sig A, Fringe 
B, and Phi Kap B. The times recorded 
-were not the fastest, but they provided a
tight race for first and second place in 
the heat. Phi Kap B won with 2:25.09 
and Kappa Sig was close behind at 
2:28.88. Fringe B came in last with an 
almost 15-second difference from first 
place at 2:39.26.
The third heat featured only two bug
gies: PiKA B and SDC B. This race 
proved that rankings of the push teams 
can be deceiving. PiKA B finished with 
the fastest time at that point of the 
competition at 2:17.15. SDC B finished 
almost 15 seconds behind PiKAs C team 
at 2:30.80. Both teams had strong starts, 
but its the finish that makes the differ
ence.
The fourth heat featured KDRB, Spirit 
C, and Phi Kap C. This was an even race, 
with the buggies in line all the way 
through the race. Spirit C finished with 
2:24.09, enough to put them in second 
place for the time being. Phi Kap C came 
in at 2:29.19, about five seconds in front 
of KDR B, who finished with 2:34.34. 
Phi Kap C was disqualified, however, 
because of an interference issue. Awheel 
cover of their buggy fell off during the 
race and hit KDRs buggy windshield.
Andrew Mcuermott/ lartan uontnouting taitor 
; Racing up Hill 2 of the Sweepstakes course are (I to r): KDR B, Spirit C, and Phi Kap C.
The fact that the cover 
came off would not have 
disqualified them, but 
because it interfered with 
the race of another team, 
the Phi Kap team was dis
qualified.
Heat 5 was a close race 
for second and third 
place. Sig Tau A, Sigma 
Nu A, and Beta C had a 
great race. Sigma Nu A 
came in unchallenged 
with 2:17.16. The real 
race in this heat was for 
second place. Betas C 
team beat Sig Taus A 
team by less than a sec
ond. Beta C finished with 
2:32.50, and Sig Tau fin
ished at 2:33.00. Sigma 
Nu A moved into second
place one second behind ^ _vlhhr hd ex Tyrone Rouse,PiKA B. Tight races are 3 1
what make buggy competition so in
tense, and this one was exactly that.
Pioneers A, DTD A, and Kappa Sig B 
made up heat 6. Pioneers A won this race, 
coming in at 2:18.94. DTD A 
was second with 2:29.80, and 
Kap Sig B was last with 
2:41.80. This race was afairly 
predictable one once the gun 
went off. The buggies were 
evenly spaced through the 
whole race. Pioneers As time 
was fast enough to put them 
in the number three spottemporarily. DTDs A team was 
disqualified after the race for 
failing the brake test. All of 
the buggies were required to 
pass this brake test after the 
race for their times to count.
AEPi A, PiKA B, and SDC 
Akicked off the seventhheat. 
SDC A finished first with 
2:19.83 and made sure not to 
miss the pushbar at the finSam Greenfield/Special to The Tartan

ish line again this year. This was enough 
to put them in the top four. PiKA B 
ended with.2:27.44, andAEPi was blown 
away when they crossed the finish line 
with the second slowest time of the morn
ing: 2:49.29.
The eighth heat consisted of Sig Tau 
B, Fringe A, and Spirit B. Not surpris
ingly, Spirits B team took an early lead 
and kept it throughout the race. They 
dominated the heat, and at that point, 
the contention, with 2:15.21. Fringe A 
followed in at 2:25.43, and Sig Tau B at 
2:34.06.
The last four heats held the teams 
that were picked to finish in the top 
spots, and most of the races proved to be 
tension builders for the organizations, 
as well as the fans. The first place win
ners crossed the finish line much earlier 
than the other competitors in their heat. 
The finishing times were extremely close, 
and the leading teams did everything 
but douse their rivals. The last four 
races were a battle for first place, and
provided the most excitement for the 
morning.
Heat 9 was anything but a close race 
between Phi Kap A, Pioneers B, and DU 
A. Phi Kap A took the heat easily cross
ing the finish line with a new leading 
time of 2:14.46, proving themselves wor
thy contenders. About 15 seconds later, 
Pioneers B crossed the line at 2:31.12. 
DU A followed with 2:44.38.
Sigma Nu B, Beta A, and SDC C raced 
in the 10th heat. After spinning last 
year, everyone was anxious to see just 
how fast Betas new buggy really was. 
Beta A dominated the heat with the 
fastest time up Hill 1, and the fastest 
time of the race day at the time, finish
ing at 2:14.12 and holding first place. 
Sigma Nu B followed with 2:24.82, and 
SDC C crawled in with the slowest time 
of the day 2:53.68.
Heat 11 proved to be just as exciting 
with the former champions racing to 
keep their title. Spirit D, PiKA A, and

Friday was a slow day as 
buggy races normally go. But 
free hot chocolate and the stillsmoldering remains of an ex
ploded course check car on the 
back of the track seemed to at
tract more crowds than usual to 
the start (and end) of womens 
Sweepstakes 97. The women, 
despite the freezing temps, had 
somethingto proveand Spirit 
A ended up being the team to do 
it, clinching their third straight 
Sweepstakes victory.
The cold affected everyone 
from the buggies to the pushers 
that were huddledin sweatpants 
and under blankets. The 
womens teams were off of the 
record mark set by Spirit in 1995 
of 2:33.03 by at least four sec
onds. The qualifying times for 
the potential next day of races 
hovered around 3 minutes. As 
everyones eyes turned skyward, 
they wondered if there would be 
another chance tomorrow. 
Would PiKA A be able to shave 
off the seven seconds it needed 
to catch the fleet-footed Spirit 
women? Would Beta women be 
able to make their best Sweep
stakes showing in history?
The forecast was not good: 100 
percent chance of precipitation. 
Sure enough, Saturday at 7am,
30 minutes before the scheduled 
start of races, the sky opened 
up. Horribly, second chances
started to wash away. For the 
top six teams that had advanced, 
the emotional hunt for hard
ware mixed rain with tears of 
frustration.
It was too wet Saturday morn
ing for a mechanic to light a 
cigarette. In the rule book, 
Sweepstakes prepares for a pos
sible rainout of races. Their rule: 
if races are canceled the second 
day, prelims count.
In the downpour, buggies and 
drivers stayed under wraps in 
the trucks to stay warm and 
dry. Pushers from all organiza
tions stuffed themselves into 
Margaret Morrison, laying 
along the walls and waiting. 
When the Sweepstakes commit
tee finally called off the races at
9 am, the womens top three 
standings were as they had been 
coming into final day: Spirit A 
2:37, PiKA A 2:44.73, Sig Nu A 
2:47.42. Beta A, SDC A, and 
Pioneers A also made the finals 
races. They were joined by 
PhiKap A, Spirit B, and KDR A 
who were awarded rerolls. 
Spirit B had the fourth fastest 
time on prelim day.
The six heats of 17 womens 
teams rolled without major ac
cidents occurring. In spite of 
some close races, all ofthe teams 
made it through the chute with
out spinning.
But neither rain nor lost 
chances could deter the positive 
nature of the pushers from all

So the weather didnt hold. A 
number of booths sustained 
enough water damage to shut 
down many of the games on Sat
urday. But spirits and tensions 
ran high in the SDC tent on Sat
urday evening as the winners of 
buggy and booth awards were 
announced.
Buggy design awards were an
nounced first. The Peoples Choice 
went to Sigma Nu, as did the 
third place award. SDCs Rage 
was awarded second place. Spirit 
began their evenings sweep with 
first place for Demani.
In womens buggy, Spirit A took 
first place and also received a 
plaque in honor of their victory 
last year. They were followed by 
Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) A in sec
ond, and Sigma Nu A in third. 
The Beta crowd shouted Fuck 
you, PiKA during the announce
ment of these awards, and Beta, 
youre full of class, was PiKAs 
buggy chairs response while ac
cepting their award.
In mens buggy, only first place 
through sixth place were awarded 
prizes because of the rain. PiKA 
B took sixth place. Spirit contin

their B team placing fifth. Phi 
Kap A placed fourth. PiKA A 
placed third. Boos greeted Beta

Without a doubt, the top ten teams

Booth builders hammer out television shows

Tartan Staffwriter
Pee-Wees Playhouse, Dukes of Hazzard, and Speed Racer. 
CMU students and the Pittsburgh community got to reminisce about 
these favorite shows of the past, as they walked through the booths on 
Midway at this years Carnival. This years creative and intricate 
booths pertaining to the theme Television Shows represented the 
dedication and hardwork that CMU students possess.
This booth ranks up with the great Phi Kap booths of the past, 
said alumnus Omar Sharief, a chemical engineering major from the 
Class of 1996. The judges must have agreed with Sharief, as Phi 
Kappa Theta took first place in the fraternity category for their 
Sherlock Holmes booth replicating the detectives Baker Street 
home. The two-story booth was fully furnished with wallpapering, 
carpeting, and hardwood floors. A fireplace was made using real 
bricks, and stained glass windows were all made by students to 
decorate the exterior of the house.
It took about 7 1/2 tons of wood. [The booth is] built by hand, 
except for the chandeliers, [and] all the wiring was done by people 
in the house, said Ali Ardalan, a freshman electrical engineering 
and industrial management major.
The Asian Student Associations (ASA) Sesame Street booth won 
first place in the Independent category. Kids entered with their 
mouths opened wide as they were greeted by an eight-foot Big Bird, 
which was handmade by members of the organization, using yellow 
felt and chicken wire around a wooden frame. The organization also 
handmade Elmo, Cookie Monster, Ernie, Bert, and other well-known 
Sesame Street characters.
[The kids] are generally pretty excited because they can recognize 
everything, said Patrick Conlin, a junior creative writing major and 
co-booth chair for the organization. Inside the Sesame Street booth, 
kids won Sesame Street magnets and balloons as they played 
Ouch the Grouch by throwing foil balls into Oscar the Grouchs 
famous trashcan while the lid moved up and down.
Most booth builders agreed that building booths unites their 
organizations. The whole six hours we were raising the roof to
gether really brought the house together. It was a common goal and 
we all achieved it, said Pamela Brann, a sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering major and sister in Delta Delta Delta. Their 
I Dream of Jeannie booth, which was shaped like the inside of 
Jeannies bottle, won first place in the sorority category, as visitors 
were greeted by a fully-costumed Jeannie.
Booth builders also agreed almost unanimously that the satisfac
tion of building the booths comes from the reactions of children who

enter and play the games. Delta Upsilon (DU) recre
ated a lost cave that Young Indiana Jones stumbled 
upon in their booth, The Young Indiana Jones 
Chronicles, which won second place in the fraternity 
category. The booth was completely made by hand 
using sanded and painted Styrofoam on a wooden 
frame. We didnt want to just go out and buy a lot of 
pre-made stuff, so we put our minds together and tried 
to come up with the most creative booth we could, 
said Doug Dandridge, a sophomore psychology major.
Inside the cave is a statue that Young 
Indiana Jones sees, and players used 
a slingshot to try and hit the statues 
idol. The fun of it is when you see the 
kids take their three shots with the 
slingshot, said Dandridge. The 
statues moving hand lowered a candy 
prize when the idol was hit.

Pee-Wees Playhouse booth was fullyequipped with familiar objects of the 
playhouse, such as Chairy, Conky, the 
Genie, and the Puppet Band, which 
were all handmade. Dancing flowers

booth. It really reflects us because we

Have you ever wanted to gripe 
and swear a lot? Sure.
But have you ever expected to 
get applause for griping and 
swearing? If youve stretched your 
imagination that far, how about 
getting $100 for griping and 
swearing? Well, it is possible, but 
unless you were in Fridays Po
etry Slam, you may have missed 
your shot.
The Poetry Slam was held at 
1:30 pm on Friday at the Midway 
side tent in the Morewood park
ing lot. Both CMU and Pitt stu
dents participated by reading 
pieces of their work on stage.
Third place went to Jessica 
Prusakowski, an H&SS fresh
man, Second place went to a Pitt 
student who entered the contest 
as Secret Agent X-9 and would 
not give his real name. First place 
and $100 was awarded to Hillary 
Bergman, a Pitt student.
A panel of five judges gave 
scores for each reader in a diving 
competition style where each 
judge writes a number from one
to ten on a sheet of paper and 
displays it. According to co-coor
dinators Brandy Humphrey of the 
Oakland Review and a junior En
glish major at CMU, and Pitt 
student Sam Williamson of the 
Three Rivers Review, the judges 
were selected from Pitt and CMU 
faculty and from the local artistic 
community.
The judges panel consisted of 
CMU English professor Gerald 
Costanzo, Karl Mullen of the 
musical group Plowmans Lunch, 
poet Jan Beatty, Micki Myers of 
the Beehive Reading Series, and 
Arthur Erbe of Pitts English de
partment. The- Oakland Review 
and the Three Rivers Review 
sponsored the Slam, which was 
promoted by the Beehive.
The event had a fun, relaxed 
atmosphere. Sign up now or 
forever hold your peace. You 
can hold your piece while 
reading, too. We wont object, 
said Myers.
A Poetry Slam features poetry 
that is delivered in an emotional 
manner, similar to performance 
poetry. The audience encouraged 
the artists by reacting positively
to the vivid readers. This guys 
got it! said Humphrey of contes
tant Donovan Chases poetry. A 
good deal of the performers criti
cized pretentiousness in the art 
world and in American culture.
Contestants entered by paying
a $1 entry fee and coming on 
stage. About 20 students tookpart 
in the three-part competition. Ten 
advanced to the second stage and 
five of those ten to the third stage. 
Some of the participants did not 
expect this elimination style and
nearly ran out of things to read.
The Master of Ceremonies for 
the event was Terrance Hayes. 
Hayes is a Master of Fine Arts 
student at Pitt and takes part in 
several reading series including 
the Beehive Reading Series. Dur
ing an intermission, Hayes read 
a work of his own entitled I Wish 
I Was Fat.
Around 100 people gathered for 
the Poetry Slam. The audience,- 
participants, and judges all 
seemed to enjoy the event.

Rain doesnt dampen Carnival Within A Carnival
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Two contenders balance on padded 
pedestals on a red and yellow inflatable 
mat. Adorned with protective helmets 
and clutching weapons that resemble 
oars with pillows on each end, they 
swing and poke to try and knock each 
other off the pedestal. One participant 
delivers a well-timed jab, and the other 
loses his own balance and takes his 
opponent with him in his fall onto the 
springy air bag.
This entertaining, if not somewhat 
comic, pastime, is called the joust, and 
was just one of the unusual activities at 
this years Carnival Within A Carnival.
Because of the rainy Saturday weather, 
the afternoons activities had to be moved 
into the University Center gym. There 
were several other audience-participa
tion-oriented games, including the 
bungee run, human bowling, and sumo 
wrestling. CMU Catering provided a 100- 
foot submarine sandwich for the event.
Despite the rainy weather outside, the 
music, food, and games transformed the 
UC gym into another carnival to compli
ment the full-scale Midway.
One participant in the joust, junior 
computer science major John 
Crisostomo, had a string of wins early in 
the afternoon. You cant get them [the 
other contestant] off by swinging the 
[jousting stick]its not heavy eno ugh, 
said Crisostomo.  You have to poke at 
the right time. [The Carnival Within A 
Carnival] is great because you dont have 
to pay, and itslots of fun. [The rides] are 
fun, but being on a ride is so passive. Im 
going to try everything today.
Another activity that Crisostomo tried 
was sumo wrestling. For this game, par
ticipants wear sumo suits, which are meant 
to simulate the weight and built of a real 
sumo wrestler. The competitors then try 
to push each other out of a ring drawn on 
a padded mat.

ence major Tony Rippy.
You have to stay low and try to knock 
him off-balance, said Long. Ive never 
tried [sumo wrestling] before. Were just 
keeping our shoes off and going from 
game to game.
Senior material science engineering 
major Tom Gilbert, the Saturday Event 
chair for Carnival, said that the weather 
was a problem at first, but the use of the 
UC gym still made the event possible.
We were initially going to try to split 
the activities between [the UC gym] and 
the SDC tent, said Gilbert. We knew 
that the weather was going to be a factor. 
We tried to be as flexible as we could this 
morning. The gym is very accessible to 
the outside, and it allows us to have 
Carnival indoors.... The idea behind this 
event was that we wanted something to 
bridge the gap between the [buggy] races 
and the Midway.
Halfway into the afternoon, the set-up 
crew began to assemble a new attraction 
for Carnival Within A Carnival. A large 
sheet of plastic was brought in from the
outside with the help of several 
bystanders, unrolled, and spread 
out in the empty space in the 
center of the gym. The plastic 
was hooked up to an air blower, 
and an indoor laser tag arena 
rose out of the black plastic on 
the floor. The Lazer Arena was 
by far the most popular activity 
of the afternoon. As soon as the Human 
game was set up inside, a line 
stretching out the gym doors had formed.
For this game of laser tag, teams of four 
were sent into the arena, an open space lit 
only by black light. The team with the 
most cumulative hits within the fiveminute period was declared the winner.
Other activities included human bowl
ing, where a person is strapped into a 
chair in a round metal cage which serves 
as the ball, and then rolled by two people 
down an alley into padded pins.
The last game of Carnival Within A 
Carnival was the bungee run. In this 
game, an inflated mat has two alleys 
divided by a barrier with velcro on top.

bowling was a popular rainy day game.
Participants start at the back of the alley 
with bungee cords attached to harnesses 
on their backs, and then have to run to 
grab markers stuck to the velcro before 
the bungee cords send them bouncing 
back to the beginning.
With all of the interesting games to 
avert their attention from the disap
pointing rainy weather, Carnival Within 
A Carnival was a hit with students.
It doesnt matter whether its out
side, said Long. It would be fun either 
way. Its good to have this on a rainy day. 
It gives everyone something to do for 
Carnival while the Midway is all wet.Poetry Slam offers forum for artists to express themselves

Letters to Cleo prove their worth as main band
By BRADLEY ZIMMERMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
So the rain didnt cause a total 
wash-out. Granted, it wasnt 
thrilling waiting in line in a semi
downpour for half an hour, but 
Letters to Cleo and Angry Salad 
surpassed all expectations on 
Carnival Saturday.
First of all, why the hell didnt 
the committee use a large tent for 
the show? Skibo Gymnasium, 
where the concert was resched
uled from the Cut, is a massive 
industrial structure of concrete 
and steel which creates an aural 
environment approximatly 
equivalent to sticking your head 
in a metal bucket and banging it 
with a lead pipe. Reverb and echo 
out the wazoo. Not to place us in 
better company, but this is the 
reason shows at hockey arenas 
are so unbearable.
Starting only about 25 minutes 
late (as opposed to last years 
ludicrous hour and 15 minute 
wait), Angry Salad took the stage. 
An amiable bunch of longhairs, 
the Boston four-piece got as warm 
a welcome as can be expected 
from CMUs notoriously apathetic 
population. I really dont get the 
comparisons between them and 
The Cure  Angry Salad hit me 
as more of a cross between a looser 
Blues Traveler and the Dave 
Matthews Band  real bluesy 
roots-rock with a bit of Grateful 
Dead noodling tossed in and a 
funky beat you can bug out to. As 
expected, their cover of 99 Red 
Balloons got everyone moving 
and set the rooms energy level 
high enough to carry them 
through the rest of their set.
Vocalist/guitarist Bob Whelan 
punctuated the between-song 
lulls with amusing stories of failed 
relationships in which girlfriends 
decided they were lesbians, e.g.
switching teams, leaving me to 
play shortstop (alluding to the 
set of songs they refer to as the 
lesbian trilogy) and an impres
sion of Grover having sex. Its a 
cool party trick to say the least.
After a liberal smattering of 
songs from their two CDs, The 
Guinea Pig EP and Bizarre Gar
dening Accident, they closed out 
their day being as funky as four 
goofy-looking white guys can be 
with their cover of the Jackson 
5s I Want You Back. Angry 
Salad gets mucho props for a fun 
show, and I hope to see them 
back soon  any band who can 
get CMXFs collective booty shak
ing without programmed drums 
is mondo kewlie-o.
According to the annual Ricci 
Report (I always hit up Sergeant 
William Ricci of CMU Police for 
the securitys view of the Carni
val bands), the attendance hit a 
high of 700 people by Letters to 
Cleos second song. Not bad at all 
really, considering the conditions.
Letters to Cleo? Well, shoe 
leather tastes horrible. This is 
the part where I make a public 
apology to the band  they 
rocked with attitude. Not alsorans in the least, Letters to Cleo 
are easily one of the better bands 
to appear at Carnival in recent 
memory. Opening with Demon 
Rock off their gritty Wh olesale 
Meats and Fish album, I was 
struck dumb with how powerful 
Kay Hanleys voice was. Were 
talking strong, full-bodied, and 
at times piercing kind of strong
 kinda like Murphys Irish 
Stout  and she swaggered 
across the stage with the kind of 
sex appeal that makes a worldclass lead vocalist. I began to 
understand Jan Endlichs line of 
thinking when he said he was 
going to jump on stage to kiss her. 
Probably a good thing he didnt,
since she probably 
wouldve clocked him 
with the water bottle 
she was taking lib
eral swigs from.
The entire band 
was rather ani
mated  a stark 
contrast to Angry 
Salads groovin-inplace presence  
from a hyper-active 
bouncing bassist, to 
indie-str angling 
guitarists, to the 
new drummer who 
kept a smile even 
though he didnt 
know the bands 
whole catalogue 
quite yet. Pulling 
through a set domi
nated by material 
from Wholesale...,
Letters to Cleo 
somehow kept the 
pop melodies shim
mering brightly over 
a grating, semi
punk instrumenta
tion worlds ahead of 
common radio fod
der, especially on 
the beefed-up Big 
Star and Fast 
Way. Yeah, I was 
bummed the faster 
Pizza Cutter and 
You Dirty Rat 
were absent, but the 
Pumpkins-esque 
downerLaudanum 
was a breakneck 
turn into mellow
ness which showed 
a diversity and conviction which 
many other bands lack.
Their infamous radio hit Here 
and Now, from Aurora Gory 
Alice, was greeted as if it were the 
greatest thing since falling RAM 
prices, or maybe its because its

Brownie Mary gets crowd psychedThe Clarks draw
massive crowd
By SUSIE CRIBBS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Judging by the line extending 
from the SDC tent last Friday 
night, one would have thought 
that the Activities Board had 
brought in a world-famous rock 
group. Forty-five minutes before 
the show even started, security 
volunteers were blocking the en
trance to the tent to keep people 
out. What group could possibly 
be drawing such a crowd on the 
CMU campus? No Doubt? Bush? 
Jewel? No, in fact, it was a local 
Pittsburgh group that just re
cently received their first national 
record contract with MCA/Way 
Cool Records. The line in front of 
the SDC tent was because of The 
Clarks, a group of four down-toearth guys who have the ability 
to woo and charm audiences with 
their high-energy performances.
From the beginning strains of 
Rain until the final chords of 
Cigarette, The Clarks rocked 
the carnival crowd with their 
original blend of a classic, 70s 
rock sound with their own origi
nality in lyrics and a somewhat 
folksy guitar sound. The tal
ents of drummer Dave Minarik, 
guitarist and vocalist Robert 
James, bass guitarist Greg Jo
seph, and the clear, energetic 
lyrics pouring forth from the 
mouth of lead vocalist Scott 
Blasey all combined to produce
the success of the concert.
Veteran Clarks fans were de
lighted by live versions of favor
ites like Penny on the Floor, 
Courtney, Now and Then, and 
Stop! The group pulled a few 
surprises out of their musical bag, 
however, by performing new ad
ditions to the old Clarks favor
ites, like Help Me Out, God 
Save the Snowman, and 
Mothers Only Son. This combi
nation of old and new provided a 
sense of anticipation at the be
ginning of each song for both vet
eran and converted Clarkies.
The most amazing feature of 
the concert was the audience. As 
the band took the stage, everyone 
jumped out of their seats and 
flocked to the stage. There was 
excitement in the fans  some
thing missing in CMU students 
much of the time. On the more 
popular songs (Penny on the 
Floor and Cigarette), the audi
ence was audible over the band.
The Clarks show was the high
light of the entire Carnival week
end. The talent of the band, the 
lyrics, and the attitude of the 
crowd all contributed to a show 
that was unequaled, even by 
Brownie Mary. All the audience 
needed was Scott Blasey, Greg 
Joseph, Robert James,Dave 
Minarik, a few guitars, some 
drums and microphones, and a 
Cigarette or two to make the 
night a huge success.
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
It should come as no surprise 
that at a school as demanding as 
CMU, when the time comes to let 
it all loose, its done in the biggest 
way possible. Hell, we even in
vent new ways for people to have 
fun, like shooting them downhills 
in buggies inches from the ground. 
Perhaps nowhere was fun more 
evident than in the SDC tent Fri
day night, where Brownie Mary 
played to a sizable crowd. Stylis
tically, the band tried to keep 
things varied with changing vo
cal and musical styles, although 
the music stayed upbeat through
out.
Brownie Mary opened with 
Take Yer Time (Ill Be Around), 
bff of their Thats Me album, a 
nice happy number accentuated 
by a guitar solo in the middle and
Kelsey Barbers clear vocals. Af
ter this came a more mellow song 
followed by one that picked up 
the pace, setting the theme for 
the night. By now, the crowd was 
fully into the music and joined 
the band in jumping all around. 
People could be seen crowd surf
ing towards the front of the tent, 
obviously enjoying themselves.
The catchy Water ran into a 
song, Great, that the band 
stated would be on the next al
bum to be released this fall. It 
was somewhere around this point 
that Campus Police tried to get 
people to move away from the 
stage, but no one seemed to care
 they were having too much 
fun. The show continued onward 
with the wary police watching 
the stage, but not interrupting 
the vibe.
Toward the end when we 
thought we had seen all Brownie
Mary had to offer, it broke out the 
infectious Kool Kat which got 
everyone moving. Shortly after
wards, another new song, Blind 
Obsession, was debuted. A few 
tracks later, the band ended their 
set with the crowd still hungry 
for more.
Due to the positive reaction, as 
an added bonus, the band re
turned to perform a two-song 
encore. By this point we really 
had seen everything from the 
band, from purely pop alterna
tive to a slightly harder sound
with obligatory guitar solos. 
Wisely, most people sought 
shelter to prepare for the next 
day.
As evidenced in their hourlong set, Brownie Mary proved 
they were just what Carnival 
needed. The vibrant perfor
mance pleased old fans, gained 
them some new ones, and had 
everyone moving. All in all, the 
event proved to be a worthy 
preamble to Saturdays festivi
ties, and nothing could spoil 
the mood.

Kiltie Band opens Carnival
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Personnel Manager
Immediately after the opening ceremonies for Carnival, a crowd of people 
followed the sound of the Kiltie Bands march across campus to the SDC tent 
on Midway to listen to the bands season-ending Spring Carnival perfor
mance. After the entire band was set up and crammed onto the stage, they 
leaped into their opening number, a concert march entitled The Maestro, by 
Eric 0. Steling. This was followed by the overture from the French opera The 
Dragoons of Villars, composed by L. Aime Maillart. The Kilties then contin
ued in the cultural theme with a medley of pieces from the musical Camelot 
by Frederick Loewe. The.band then presented a challenging piece by William 
Francis McBeth called Masque.
At the halfway point of the program, the Kiltie Band played Symphonic 
Variations on Amazing Grace, arranged by Claude T. Smith. This piece took 
the traditional melody of Amazing Grace and presented it in as many 
musical styles as possible  throughout the variations, the tune was carried 
by every instrument from the flute to the tuba. The next selection was 
Florentiner March, a grand Italian march by Julius Fucik. The Kilties 
wound down the concert with a tribute to jazz legend Duke Ellington with An 
Ellington Portrait, a compilation of his great works, including It Dont Mean 
A Thing (If It Aint Got That Swing).
After having the departing seniors stand to be acknowledged, the band 
concluded the concert with Black Horse Troop by John Philip Sousa and a 
piece entitled Whip & Spur. Toward the end of the concert, the Kiltie Band 
found themselves competing with the sounds of power tools from booth 
construction and another concert on the Midway stage, but the Kilties proved 
once again that they have the power to drown out nearly anything. As is their 
tradition, the band closed their concert by singing Dear Old Tech and The 
Skibo Song.

Bands channel diverse sounds at Carnival
Marlows Steamboat features local youth
By AMY BERGER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The extremely low turnout for 
Marlows Steamboat in the SDC tent on 
Friday is yet another big hint about 
something we already know  CMU 
students are intelligent. Really intelli
gent  so smart that most of them knew 
to stay away from this performance.
At first, I felt bad for the band when 
there werent more than 25 people in the 
audience. But after a few songs, I had 
heard more than enough.
So did most others, who I 
saw leaving quickly and 
without guilt.
The band might as well 
not have done a sound 
check, unless they were 
aiming for that everybody 
screaming but no one can 
understand a single word 
were saying type of sound.
The only words I under
stood through the entire 
show were when the vocal
ist said, Hi, were 
Marlows Steamboat and 
were gonna play for about 
an hour. I dont know why 
the songs even had lyrics.
It wasnt like anyone could 
understand them or any
thing. Why write words 
when theyre not going to 
be heard? They really 
should have paid more at
tention to the volume of the guitars in 
relation to that of the singer. And were 
three mics just for the drums absolutely 
necessary?
If they had been an instrumental 
group, they would have been better. It 
was obvious they had musical talent. 
The drummer played some great fills, 
and the bassist had an impressive solo, 
but it seemed like they were more inter
ested in showing off their individual 
talent rather than paying attention to 
balance. Its not that the singer was bad

Marlows Steamboat left concert goers reaching for Aspirin.
 he was actually pretty decent, but 
that really didnt mean a whole lot when 
I had no clue what he was singing about.
I found the performance very unprofes
sional. I heard the music described as alter
native jazz. This music was definitely an 
alternative, but had nothing to do with jazz. 
Maybe it was an alternative to music for the 
planet Earth. All I know is that it sounded 
like a bunch of kids fooling around with 
amps and yelling unintelligibly in their ga
rage or basement.
Marlows Steamboat should have bet
ter assessed the size of 
the tent. They were play
ing at a volume that 
wouldve been appropri
ate for a stadium, not a 
space of a few hundred 
yards. They were way 
too loud, and my head 
was pounding when I left 
the show. I find it hard 
to respect a band that 
doesnt respect its audi
ence. I didnt see them 
pushing any Marlows 
Steamboat merchan
dise, but I think they 
wouldve made a little 
money if they had a 
stand where I could 
have bought Advil or 
something to make me 
feel better. And I could 
have used the cotton 
from the pill bottle to 
stuff my ears.The Buffalo Boys play with folk influence
By TOM LIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Buffalo Boys, a band made up of 
CMU students, may be a familiar name 
to you if youve listened to their show on 
WRCT. The group played Friday as part 
of the festivities of Spring Carnival, 
bringing with them lots of guitars and 
lots of enthusiasm.
There are six members in The Buffalo 
Boys. Jordan Anderson, a senior indus
trial management major, plays the banjo; 
John Biggs, a senior information sys
tems major, handles the acoustic guitar
and is the bands lead singer; Josh Curtin, 
a senior industrial management major, 
plays electric guitar, as does Amit Kar, 
also a senior in industrial manage
ment; Jay Miolla, a junior design ma
jor, beats the drums; and Matt Solitro, 
a senior chemistry major, is the groups 
bass player.
The band played about 10 songs, and 
though their performance was adver
tised as country and folk covers, few of 
these songs were played. Instead, there 
seemed to be more of a focus on rock 
songs, and the Buffalo Boys played 
selections from Green Day, The Cure,
Van Morrison, and Tom Petty, though 
they played a bit of folk and country.
The vocals were okay considering 
the band was playing without moni
tors; the instrumentals were quite 
strong.
In particular, the sharp banjo-play
ing skills of Jordan Anderson gave the 
Buffalo Boys a quirky and muchneeded lift, since through much of the 
performance the volumes on the vari
ous instruments and microphones were 
set at conflicting levels. However, the 
Buffalo Boys put on an entertaining 
and enjoyable performance.
Orchestra Tropical plays with Latin influence
By JENNY GARCIADE OSUNA
Tartan Forum Co-Editor
On the first night of Carnival, 
the area around the Midway stage 
was empty. Then Orchestra 
Tropical, a local Latino band, be
gan to play their first song: a 
salsa jumping with rhythm and 
passion. By the time the song 
ended, the area around the stage 
had about 50 people gathered. By 
their second song, the place was
full of people dancing, tapping 
their feet to the beat, or simply 
enjoying the music.
I think having [Orchestra 
Tropical] is a great thing. Their 
beat is very, festive  a complex 
kind of music, said John Arroyo, 
junior electrical and computer 
engineering major. The other al
ternative bands [playing at Car
nival] are all right, but its all the 
same thing; its the same chords 
over and over again. This is a
9eaRCCR wessRctQeYol*.ucCul hioCo HCudd 
Orchestra Tropical kept the crowd dancing to their Latin beats.
great change.
The bands festive feel was a 
hit. The ten members of the band 
danced around to their music, 
which really fired up the crowd. 
Though it seemed a great mix of 
the CMU community attended, 
the crowd was largely made up of 
the members from the Ballroom 
Dance club.
Hands off, this is a Ballroom 
Dance thing, said John 
Crisostomo, sophomore CS ma
jor. Regardless, I do think the 
band is great. There are a lot of 
things going on [during Carni
val], and these are the activi
ties that really make it fun. 
Orchesta Tropical played for 
about an hour, with an ener
getic mix of salsa, merengue, 
mambo, and rumba music. The 
band plays regularly in clubs 
around Pittsburgh such as 
Cozumel and Metropol, and 
played on campus during this 
years International Festival.
Ive heard them quite of
ten; theyre really good, said 
Annie Garibaldi, sophomore 
modern languages major and 
member of the Ballroom 
Dance club. This music is 
great for the ballroom danc
ers and, of course, for the rest 
of the campus as well.
The Beelzebubs give a-capella performance
By MAX CHITTISTER
Tartan Staffwriter
They looked like 12 guys on 
their way to their high school 
graduation, wearing suits with 
funky ties and their hair 
messed up by the rain and 
wind. And then they gathered 
around the microphones, 
screwed their faces up into 
truly hideous-looking contor
tions, and from somewhere in 
that mass of funny-looking 
guys, music came out.
The Beelzebubs, an all-male 
a-cappella band from Tufts 
University, performed in the 
SDC Tent on Saturday after
noon as part of Carnival. De
spite the rain, a fairly large 
crowd was on hand, both sit
ting and standing.
Their playlist was extensive, 
including arrangements of clas
sic rock, ballads, and pop. The 
show also included a number of 
short comedy bits.
I cant stand Del Amitri, but 
when they sang Roll To Me, I 
almost enjoyed it  thats the 
highest compliment I can give. 
Keeping with their pattern of 
including Peter Gabriel in ev
erything, they performed 
Sledgehammer. They sang
some ballads that you might ex
pect would lend themselves to acappella. With or Without 
You? I could see that. Every
body Hurts? Sounds good.
But... Walk This Way? Wel
come to the Jungle? Bel Biv 
DeVoes Poison? These guys will 
never be accused of not taking a 
chance. For the most part, the 
chances paid off; the songs were 
very enjoyable. Maybe they 
werent note-perfect on these; 
maybe it was a little hard to hear 
the lead singer sometimes. But 
their enthusiasm more than made 
up for it. Ive never seen 12 guys 
have so much fun on stage before.
Theres no doubt in my mind 
that the highlights of the show 
were the Beatles covers: A Day 
in the Life and I Am The Wal
rus. I should have expected this 
from a band name Beelzebub, 
but they managed to find and 
bring out the devil in each of 
these songs. Literally. They 
chanted The devil the devil the 
devil, made scary faces, and 
danced around the stage in a gro
tesque show of Satan worship. Or 
something.
Their comedy, while not as good 
as the music, was pretty fair. A 
one-minute sketch called Crosby, 
Stills, Nash, and Chung made
no sense. A set of self-help in
structions taught us that all you 
have to do as a successful pick
pocket is say Hey, youre Jack 
Maynard, arent you? Youre a 
pretty good-looking guy. Can I 
have your wallet? They mocked 
Star Wars in a sketch about digi
tally remastering your life. This 
was aided by the unexpected-uninvited-but-entirely-appropriate 
horn from The Dukes ofHazzard-.
No doubt, the comedy high
light was Romeo and Mickey, 
the lost first draft of Romeo and 
Juliet. Who would have guessed 
that Romeos first line would be 
O Mickey, youre so fine, youre 
so fine you blow my mind, hey 
Mickey! The rest of the show 
was bad 80s lyrics, strung to-* 
gether to make a show eerily 
similar to Romeo and Juliet.
After the show, CDs were avail
able for sale. Gilding and House 
are both fantastic albums.
The Bubs sound great, both 
in person and on CD. But if you 
want the full effect, youve got 
to track them down live. If were 
lucky, we can con them into 
coming back. Ill just say Hey, 
Jack Maynard, youre a good 
looking guy. Come back to Car
nival again. And heres your 
wallet back.

Thursday nights Carnival activi
ties were topped offby something quite 
mesmerizing. And that is no hyper
bole. Mark Pittman, performing hypactually made it into hypnosis. Those 
for whom it did not work returned to 
their seats, while a few unsuspecting 
audience members for whom it did work 
came on stage. Then the fun started.
Pittman set up a few scenarios for 
the group: a trip aboard the Intrepid
notist, gave a show that left the audi- space shuttle where the cabin heated
ence in both laughter and awe. But 
what marked his unique performance 
was that students did the entertain
ing, albeit unknowingly.
Before calling on volunteers, though, 
Pittman put to rest some myths about 
hypnosis. He explained that it is a 
natural state of focus and relaxation, 
and that it doesnt involve one persons 
will overpowering and controlling 
anothers. With that in mind, he asked 
for volunteers eager to be hypnotized, 
as it would not work with someone 
resistant to it.
Twenty-one Carnegie Mellon stu
dents were chosen, and about 16 or so

up to 105 degrees and then cooled to 25 
in the course of its orbit; experimenta
tion with plastic straws that yielded 
laughing gas from one end and tear 
gas from the other; and sudden floods 
of wonderful fragrances and horrible 
stenches. The groups reactions were a 
feast of humor for the audience.
There were also individual sugges
tions. One subject was told to forget 
the number four, and was dumb
founded when she counted out loud 
her 11 fingers. Another became the 
first male to experience pregnancy and 
childbirth. And at the end of the show, 
one student was distraught over her 
lost shirt which, at the 
command of Pittman, 
had become invisible to 
her.
So whats it like to be 
hypnotized? Two of the 
participants, Huan

as the audience was.
Comic keeps crowd laughing
By GREG MARCKS
Tartan Staffwriter
I admit I was skeptical. There are so 
many bad comics that the chances of 
getting a good one were slim. But AB 
Entertainment picked us a winner.
Marc Moran is not only an excellent 
comic, but he also seems like a really cool 
guy. His topics are the usual stand-up 
fare (the differences between men and 
women being the most obvious), but they 
are delivered with such an innocence 
that they seemed fresh. He adds new 
twists to old models, in which the stan
dard household cat and dog become an 
aardvark and a mongoose, and also is 
the first to admit that a few of his jokes, 
like the vacuum cleaner headlight rou
tine, have been done before.
I honestly felt Marc was having as 
much fun as the audience, and this put 
everyone at ease. While talking about
Walmart, Subway, and people in Ala
bama, he would continually stop and 
shake his head before continuing, but 
not disruptively like many comedians 
who laugh at their own jokes. Instead of 
ignoring camera flashes like most per
formers, he always pointed them out 
and incorporated them into his act.
Marc relayed several personal anec
dotes, the last of which had a genuine 
message: he hopes that everyone in the 
audience finds real love, because it is the 
most important thing in life, more im
portant than money or a career. After 
delivering this solemn monologue, he 
then went on to explain how his exgirlfriend (lets call her Michelle from 
New Jersey) messed up his life, inter
jecting that he has a really great job.
In addition to exposing human foibles, 
Marc also made funny noises and flailed 
his limbs. (At one point, he collapsed to 
the ground, injuring his hand in the
process. Now thats a team player!) One 
of the most impressive aspects of Marcs 
performance was his ability to use the 
only props at a comics disposal, a micro
phone, a mike stand, and a stool. Marc 
executed the standard move-the-stoolaround technique with expertise, but he 
also turned it into a toilet and a checkr 
out counter, climbing on top of it while 
grunting on both occasions. His micro: 
phone became a convincing tlphon 
and Snoopy fishing pole, and he achieved 
great sound effects by hitting the mike 
on both the stool and himself. The mike 
stand became not only the usual pointer 
stick but a pole on which to stick Michael 
Boltons severed head.
Marc Moran was recently voted Best 
Campus Comedian of 1997, and every: 
one in the tent on Saturday night now 
knows why. This was the second time he 
has performed here this year, so if you 
missed him, you missed out.
Ventriloquist sounds like a dummy
By RYAN SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
I usually dont like ventriloquists. In 
fact, the only ventriloquist Ive ever seen 
that Ive enjoyed was this guy that I saw 
on TV with quite a few different puppets 
including a jalepeno on a steeeck. Con
sequently, I wasnt too excited about 
going to see Dan Horn in the tent on 
Saturday night.
Horn began with a Toy-Yoda (notice 
the play on words, one that I, for one, 
had always noticed during Toyota com
mercials back when I was a young lad). 
Yoda could do two things: nod and... uh, 
ask someone who was there. It was pretty 
funny. It destroyed all my childhood 
exaltations of Yoda forever. Ill never be 
able to look at the little green guy again.
Another puppet to come on stage was 
the old geezer, Orson. I didnt really like 
Orson except during his song when Horn
showed some of his more amazing tal
ents by changing loudness according to 
how close Orson was to the microphone.
Orson was really obnoxious through
out, though, mainly because of his pin
ing for a young woman named Jenny in 
the audience (who was later turned into 
a display of mockery when Horn trans
formed her into a puppet herself). I did 
like the old mans voice, though. It was 
similar to Homers dad on The Simpsons.
But it was the end of the show that put 
me over the edge. He brought out 
Cassandra who looked like the girl dolly 
on the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 
Claymation Christmas special. She, too, 
found an audience member to gawk at, 
and then began to sing a song.
When it got too graphic, Horn at
tempted to put her away, shaming her. 
She refused, and then came an Exorcist 
take-off where Cassandras voice changed 
(for the better if you ask me) and head
spun around. The only thing he missed 
was the pea soup.
But then after a little while longer, he 
was going to put her in her suitcase 
when her hair fell off. Horn started laugh
ing so hard that it had to have been an 
accident. It was great, and the audience 
was in hysterics.
Then came one of the best displays of 
impromptu Ive ever seen. He continued 
by removing her eyes and putting them 
in random places on her head.
When her head was blank, it looked 
somewhat like a phallus, and Horn duly 
noted this to the amusement of the audi
ence. But like I said, this was all improvisation on his part, and it made me 
laugh all the harder and respect Horn 
more.
It was a good show especially consid
ering my prejudice against ventriloquists, and hopefully Ill catch it again 
sometime in the future.

Comedian retells stock jokes
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Staffwriter
Jonathan Brandt, the standup comedian who performed on 
Thursday night, did not send 
anyone rolling in the aisles with 
great guffaws of laughter. In all 
likelihood, he didnt say anything 
anyone is going to remember a 
year, a month, or even a week 
from now. All he did was to tell a 
whole bunch of moderately funny 
jokes. He held our attention for 
an hour. We laughed. Then we 
walked off into Carnival and for
got all about his act.
Dont get me wrong  Brandt, 
a former writer for Comedy Cen
tral, was certainly entertaining. 
Listening to him was a decent 
way to kill an hour on Thursday 
evening. Hes just not going to 
win any points for originality. 
Just like any other comedian who 
wants to keep a tentful of college 
students amused, he mainly dealt 
out alcohol jokes, sex jokes, and 
summer job jokes, with a sprin
kling of toilet humor. Nothing 
any student hadnt heard mil
lions of times before. He did 
handle these subjects well, or as 
well as can be expected when 
your opening joke requires you to 
demonstrate the proper position 
for urinating on your front lawn 
in the middle of the night. While

drunk, no less.
Once we got past that appetiz;- 
ing little scene, Brandt served up 
moderately funny routines about 
revenge tactics for when your 
summer job just doesnt go well 
(fax your employer a roll of paper 
towels  itll keep the fax ma
chine occupied for hours) andNe: 
anderthal college roommates^ 
among other things. His long, 
elastic face and physical stage 
presence helped make the differ
ence between comedy that leaves 
the audience snoozing in their 
seats and comedy that at least 
guarantees that their eyes are 
open and theyre making some 
kind of response.
Brandt also has an extremely 
versatile voice. I mean, this guy 
can imitate two different types of 
ambulance sirens, grunt like the 
aforementioned Neanderthal 
roommate, and do a pretty re
spectable impersonation of Alvin 
the chipmunk. Alvin came into 
play during Brandts rendition of 
every comedians favorite staple, 
the painfully and endearingly shy 
with the opposite sex routine. Like 
most of his bits, this was a cliche, 
but an entertaining one.
I may not remember anything 
he said in a few days time, but I 
wasnt disappointed. No one ex
pects penetrating insights or 
heaping chunks of creativity from 
a comedian hired to play for col
lege students as they begin a 
three-day-long party. They ex
pect to be amused. They expect to 
have fun. I was amused. I had 
fun. So why ask for more?

Play amuses audience
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Ever wonder what the Bible 
would be like if the Kids in the 
Hall decided to do a reenactment? 
Well wonder no longer, Scotch N 
Sodas production of Godspell has 
the answer.
The play, based on the gospel 
according to Matthew and di
rected by Robyn Nace, revolves 
around a group of 13 strangers, 
one of whom represents Jesus. 
They learn about how to be a good 
person in the eyes of God, retell
ing a few familiar parables, and 
having some musical numbers 
along the way. Its broken into 
two acts, the first being mostly 
parables, the second being the 
last supper and the crucifixion.
The one word that describes 
this production best is wacky. 
The directors touch is highly ap
parent in this version of the play. 
It almost seems like a series of 
skits, instead of a traditionally 
styled play  the first act more 
so than the second. In these skits, 
the 13 people act out parables in 
very contemporary and funny 
ways. Its full of references to 
movies (like the tax collector who 
talks like Forrest Gump and says, 
Humble is as humble does) and 
contemporary culture (like the 
goat who calls a group of sheep a 
bunch of clones).
The humor definitely put a nicer
touch on the words of the gospel 
and made it easier to watch. The 
play was never preachy, as a pro
duction entirely based on the bible 
is prone to do. Granted, there 
wasnt much in the way of char
acter development, except 
maybe for Jesus (played by 
Dana Steer), but that wasnt 
the point in this production. It 
was more of having a good time 
and maybe even learning some
thing (or maybe not).
Occasionally, though, the 
wackiness of the whole produc
tion got in the way of the stories. 
At times, it was difficult to make 
out what the actors were saying 
because they were using some 
exceedingly wacky voices. Some 
of the additions were just plain 
goofy and not very funny.
The second act had far fewer 
goofy lines in it, as it was on a 
more serious subject. This part of 
the play was very well done, and 
was more in the vein of a traditionally-styled play. The actors 
pulled off a very emotional sec
ond half, with the director show
ing some well-placed restraint on 
the wacky moments of the act.
Another of the defining points 
of this play was the action. The 
actors were all over the place, 
running, diving, and falling. Ev
ery other minute someone would 
be dropped or pushed off a ledge 
or fall on their own. All this fall
ing down was done very humor
ously, kind of like a Three Stooges 
slapstick routine. Some of the 
actors went so far as to wear 
kneepads to protect themselves 
from crippling injuries.
The musical numbers were very 
tightly played; both the band and 
the actors worked in perfect har
mony. And the music itself was 
good. There was a huge range of 
music within the play. Numbers 
like Turn Back O Man sounded 
a little bluesy, like something one 
would see in a nightclub in New 
York. Other numbers, like Day 
by Day, were more subdued and 
passionate  slower but by no 
means lesser, songs. It was this 
combination of jumping show 
tunes and intimate melodies that 
made the music great.
There were a few parts that 
went a little long, adding to the 
plays running time of two-and-ahalf hours. Several times during 
the production, the actors began 
to play ball on the stage. At the 
end of intermission, they were 
engaged in a beach ball volleyball 
game, and it wasnt clear if this 
was part of the play or just the 
actors killing time before the sec
ond act. Also, a couple of the 
musical numbers dragged on, 
wallowing in a pit of redundancy.
The play was good. I laughed, I 
cried, it was better than Cats. 
Robyn Nace did a good job in 
giving old stories a modern and 
humorous slant.
Dance group shows soul

The performance began with 
an introduction by Nadiyah Lo, 
one of the companies instruc

mission to expose our audi
ence to the culture of Africa 
through music, dance, drum

As Lo spoke, the drummers, 
dressed in orange and black 
traditional African costumes, 
began to warm up, beginning 
the drum call. The drums rolled, 
and as the sound grew more 
intense, a stilt dancer appeared 
above the crowd. Dressed in 
bright pink, green, and white, 
his waist girded by long white
fringes, and wearing an ornate 9eaRCCR wsssRctQsYol*.ucCul hioCo HCudd

seated crowd.
He grooved through those 
standing, and with perfect bal
ance, danced on one leg. Pull
ing participants from the crowd, 
the other dancers in the com
pany formed a dance line that 
wove through the stilt dancers 
legs and around the clearing.
The crowd cheered- as the stilt 
dancer disappeared behind the 
booths and the next .part of the 
performance began.
Again Lo spoke to the crowd 
pulling more volunteers onto 
the stage. Once the 20 or so 
were assembled, Lo demon
strated dance movements and 
then led the volunteers in a 
rousing routine. The crowd, im

and shrieked in encourage

the dancers expressed the true 
spontaneity and fun of the mo
ment through their body lan
guage in their individual dances 
and their smiles and laughter.
The Company took the stage 
for the closing piece and wowed 
the audience with their ener
getic and graceful movements. The stilt dancer danced over and around audience members.
