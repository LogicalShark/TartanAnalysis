Protestors rally 
against KKK
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
The Pennsylvania contin
gent of the Ku Klux Klan ral
lied in the face of angry pro
testers in downtown Pitts
burgh last Saturday. The 
event, hyped by local media 
as KKK Day, brought the 
stark reality of separatist and 
hate-groups in Pittsburghs 
front yard.
The rally was held down
town in front of the CityCounty Building at the corner 
of Grant and 4th Avenue. Last 
Friday, crews worked to pre
pare the area by hauling con
crete barriers into place and 
setting up a wire fence around 
the perimeter of the main 
demonstration area  a park
ing lot.
Protesters arrived as early 
as 11 am while a massive num
ber of police, S.W.A.T. teams, 
and paramedics had been 
staged since the early morn
ing. The authorities were 
armed with riot gear, wooden,
clubs and tear-gas. Those en
tering the main protesters 
pen were searched with hand
held metal detectors. Umbrel
las, food, and bottled drinks 
were confiscated.
I think [the rally] is kind of 
stupid. [The Klan] is in for a 
good behind whipping, said 
John, a Schenley High School 
student. Pittsburgh doesnt 
need something like this.
As the crowd grew, tempers 
flared. Occasional confronta
tions, like one between Afri
can-American protesters and 
a young woman identified by 
thePittsburgh Post-Gazette as 
Alyson Finney, marred the 
otherwise relatively non-vio
lent event.
Finney, an open KKK sup
porter, was forced into a cor
ner of the parking lot by a 
group of reporters and angry 
protesters who peppered her 
with questions and insults. 
Each time the tension rose too 
high, the police stepped in. 
Finney, before steadfast in her 
anger, looked frightened and

exhausted as police helped her 
away from the crowd.
Pittsburgh is decidedly 
unique as a large city in
terms of organized hate 
groups this is the first ex
ample of KKK activity in
years. For many protesters 
this was the first time they 
had ever seen the KKK. The

usually gone only as far as

Detective sues 
CMU officials
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Diversions Editor
Raymond A.P. Mialki, a de
tective on the Campus Police 
force, is suing the University 
for not preventing students 
from harrassing him about his 
Born-Again Christian reli
gious beliefs. He filed a law
suit in U.S. District Court on 
March 17 against CMU for 
the violation of his civil rights 
under Title 7 of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964.
Mialki is seeking a directive 
to stop any further discrimi
natory acts against Christians, 
especially Born-Again Chris
tians . He is also seeking a sum 
in excess of $75,000 in dam
ages.
I have a right under the 
Constitution, under Title 7 
that says Im allowed to be 
employed in the capacity Im 
employed and I shouldnt have 
to put up with discrimination 
and harassment, said Mialki.
A 1981 CMU graduate, 
Mialki has worked for Campus 
Police since 1979. He alleged 
the violations began in 1992 
shortly after he was promoted 
to the rank of detective. Since 
this time, he contends the Uni
versity has failed to take action 
against students who have ha
rassed him by attacking his 
religious beliefs.
According to Mialki, the first 
incident of harassment oc
curred in October of1992. Hav
ing befriended some students 
in an apartment building, 
Mialki took the students to a 
Christian rock concert. Later, 
after Mialki learned that the 
same students held an under
age drinking party in their 
apartment building, he initi
ated disciplinary action against 
the students. After the disci
plinary action, the students 
hung Playboy and Penthouse 
centerfolds on the hallway 
walls and left empty beer 
bottles in the halls. According

As a result of overall dissatis
faction with the way the Univer
sity Center has been operating, 
this years planning of the UC 
includes three town meetings, 
which attempt to gain input from 
students and faculty members 
who might have some insight on 
ways to improve the UC. So far, 
topics that have been covered are 
dining services, workout facili
ties, room reservations, the 
buildings aesthetics, general se
curity issues, programming, and 
others.
Miunony unao/ i artan rnoio taitor I think these meetings could 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, attended the town meeting be very effective, said Michael 
last Wednesday. Approximately 30 faculty members attended. Murphy, dean of Student Affairs.
It is nice to have the opportunity 
to have individuals from through
out the campus community come 
together to discuss important is
sues. Perhaps such town meet
ings, not unlike The Forum which 
Student Life runs, conducted on 
a regular basis with varying top
ics would enhance participation 
in the future.
Town meetings have been ad
vertised throughout campus in
viting anyone who wants to be a 
part of the planning of the UC for 
next year to attend. Though sev
eral issues were brought up at 
the town meetings, the meetings 
serve mainly as a forum for opin
ion, not as an active board to 
change the U.C.
The first meeting, held last 
week at 8 pm, was filled prima
rily with students. The second, 
held over lunch time when most 
students are in class, was mostly 
faculty members.
There were many thoughtful 
suggestions, said Murphy. In 
all, there seemed to be great en
thusiasm about the [University 
Center], with a good set of recom
mendations for future improve
ments.
Yet along with thoughtful sug
gestions was a roomful of angry 
students and faculty members, 
voicing their concerns on what 
areas of the U.C. did not serve 
them well this year.
One such area is room reserva
tions. The fact that it is nearly 
impossible to retain a room at the 
UC was a topic discussed.. 
Thats certainly an area that
we would like to improve our per
formance, said Steve Sitrin, di
rector of the University Center, 
at the second town meeting.
Students were also annoyed 
that the rooms on the second floor 
named, not numbered. Rooms 
labeled as the Class of1987 Room 
and the Connan Room make them 
hard to find.
Keeping the UC clean was an 
idea brought about by the 
administrations frustration with 
the filth, including cigarette butts 
and leftover food, all over the 
building.
I continue to be disappointed 
in the campus community when I 
come in and see how trashed the 
courtyard is, said Murphy.
It is doubtful that the rooms

Students tired of making treks around 
campus with RAD forms in hand, have 
long clamored for a better registration 
system. For some undergraduates, this 
will finally be a reality next week. Elec
trical and computer engineering and 
computer science majors will be the 
guinea pigs in the pilot run of studentbased electronic registration.
A major benefit of on-line registration 
will be the ability to collect data quickly
on the fluctuations of students and the 
courses that they select. Data previ
ously unavailable such as the number of 
students that attempt and do not suc
ceed to get into a class and also the 
composition of those students by class 
and major will be helpful in deciding the 
number of sections to provide the next 
semester.
Were hoping to measure everything, 
said John Papinchak, co-director of En
rollment Services. Because the more 
we can measure, the better data we can 
get to the deans. And then the deans
through their departments can make 
the appropriate changes. All in all, the 
University will be able to better serve 
the needs of the students, needs that the 
University may not have even been 
aware of previously.
Another difference will be the way 
online registration handles 
prioritization. Instead of pre-registra
tion, the departments will be able to 
reserve a specific number of spaces in 
classes for their majors. Hence there can 
be priority even though all registration

The biannual Beaux Arts Ball has 
been cancelled this year. Since the early 
1900s this elaborate costume ball, ac
companied by food and entertainment, 
has been sponsored by the College of 
Fine Arts during the spring semester.
Its purpose is to celebrate what CFA 
does and allow everyone to partake in 
that, said Maryfrancis Velez-Isip, a se
nior directing major in the drama de
partment and one of five students in the 
fieaux Arts Ball organizing committee. 
According to members of this group,
efforts to facilitate this years event have 
been met with unsuccessful results due 
to planning difficulties with adminis
trative representatives, James LaPaglia, 
Director of Security, Anne Witchner, 
director of Student Activities and assis
tant dean of Student Affairs, and Martin 
Prekop, dean of CFA.
Two members of the Beaux Arts Ball 
organizing committee, Tania Scheer, a 
senior bachelor of humanities and arts 
major and Elske Free-Burnt, a senior 
art major, said they were given the run
around during their efforts to confirm 
information with officials. We talked to 
almost every administrator who would
have a say and no one ever gave us a 
clear answer. No one wanted to say no, 
Scheer said.
Discussion about the event began in 
late November and it was scheduled to 
be held on April 12. I believe that a core 
group of interested students was not in 
place in an adequate amount of time to 
successfully plan, promote and produce 
the event, Witchner said.
Witchner has worked with previous 
committee members to facilitate the 
event. I believe that an event of this 
magnitude requires at least 12 months 
of planning. This allows for the myriad

GOLD BEACH, Ore. (AP)  Applewhite and his longtime partner, 
Heavens Gate cult members may have Bonnie Lu Nettles, had strong southern 
visited an Oregon Coast town just two Oregon connections dating to the early 
weeks before 39 members committed 1970s, when they experienced an 
suicide in Rancho Santa Fe, Califor- epiphany on the Rogue River, according
to the groups own 
Internet-published story.
They believed they 
would be assassinated 
and lie in the street for 3 
1/2 days before rising 
again in a cloud  or a 
spacecraft.
The group that visited 
Jots registered under an 
apparently false business 
name and address and 
refused to list the names 
of all the guests on the
rogicfor Thpy paid fnr
everything in cash.
Jots Resort staff said 
the woman, Sister Eliza
beth Montiqe, who made 
the reservations, and another who 
signed the registration for the group 
as Sister Michael Marie, strongly 
resembled photos of Heavens Gate 
cult members they saw after the mass 
suicide.
It freaked me out, said Amy Gaddis, 
reservations clerk at Jots Resort, where 
the group checked in the evening of 
March 6 and left March 8. It was pretty 
bizarre. You couldnt tell the men from 
the women.
They bought cases of distilled water, 
bread, snacks, and, from the store bak
ery, whole fruit pies.
The group did almost everything in 
unison at Jots. The resort ran out of hot 
water the morning after they arrived 
because they all rose at 5 am and show
ered at once. Jots staff members say 
group members always moved in pairs 
or in groups.
She also noted a peculiar janito
rial characteristic of all their rooms. 
Although they left the rooms clean

nia, The Oregonian reported. A group 
in close-cropped haircuts and match
ing outfits stayed March 6-8 at Jots 
Resort at the mouth of the Rogue River.
The groups make-up matched the 
Rancho Sante Fe suicides: 21 women 
and 18 men, including one woman 
who used a wheelchair and one man 
who was black.
The most solid link between the 
Southern California cult and the Gold 
Beach visitors was a woman who reg
istered March 6 at Jots Resort under 
the name Sister Elizabeth Montiqe.
A woman using the same name also 
had visited a San Diego charter-bus 
company a few days earlier, inquir
ing about a rate quote for a trip to 
Gold Beach.
San Diego authorities could not con
firm that the cult had visited Oregon 
that week. They do make road trips, 
said Lt. Gerald Lipscomb of the San 
Diego sheriffs department. I know 
that theyre nomadic.

Clean air debate 
heats up in D.C.
WASHINGTON (AP)  The debate 
over the Clinton administrations pro
posed air pollution requirements is 
growing increasingly nasty, as warring 
sides accuse each other of doctoring or 
inflating economic and scientific data.
An industry coalition said Thursday 
its complaints were borne out when 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
admitted an error in calculating the 
number of lives that would be saved by 
the tougher regulations. The real an
swer is that the benefits are unknown, 
said Paul Bailey, an executive with the 
American Petroleum Institute and 
head of the Air Quality Standards Coa
lition. He accused the EPA of making 
a lOth-grade math error in one of the 
benchmark scientific studies that the 
agency has used to defend tougher fed
eral health standards for smog-caus
ing ozone and microscopic dust known 
as particulates.
The EPA conceded that calculations 
it has used to support the proposed 
standards contained a technical error 
that overstated the number of prema
ture deaths that would be avoided by 
one third. Instead of 20,000 lives being 
saved, as EPA Administrator Carol 
Browner repeatedly has cited in 
speeches and congressional hearings, 
the number most likely should be 15,000 
fives, the agency said.
This error does not change the fun
damentals of our proposal  15,000 
premature deaths is a significant num
ber that underscores the need for us to 
consider a stronger standard, said EPA 
spokeswoman Loretta Ucelli.
Environmentalists and some health 
experts accused opponents of the rule of 
grasping at straws. Its not really a big 
thing, said Paul Billings, director of 
government affairs at the American 
Lung Association. Whether its 15,000 
lives or 20,000 lives, its still too many 
lives. They (opponents) have had very 
little to crow about.
Meanwhile, environmentalists ac
cused the coalition of shelving a study 
suggesting the tighter regulations may 
not have much economic impact. The 
study, commissioned by the American 
Iron and Steel Institute, is purported to 
show that the new rules would have 
little adverse economic impact on the 
city of Pittsburgh. The big polluters
have consistently lied about the poten
tial impact of the proposed standards. 
Now theyre staging a coverup, snapped 
Frank ODonnell of the Clean Air Trust, 
an environmental group.
Senate restricts 
young smokers
JACKSON, Miss. (AP)  The House 
and Senate today approved a bill that 
gives Mississippi authorities for the first 
time power to prosecute young smokers. 
Anyone under 18 caught with tobacco 
products can be fined or sentenced to 
community service. Now the state only 
has the authority to prosecute those 
who sell to minors, though this bill also 
strengthens those penalties. After a third 
offense of selling tobacco to a minor, 
state officials can seize a stores license 
to sell cigarettes.
Theyve actually got something to lose, 
thats not the case now, assistant attor
ney general Trey Bobinger said today. 
It places accountability on the retailer 
and allows the attorney generals office 
to conduct unannounced inspections of 
businesses selling tobacco.
Bobinger said a controversial part of 
the bill, which has been dubbed the 
Mississippi Juvenile Tobacco Access and 
Prevention Act, allows minors to be used 
to catch stores. We definitely believe 
this bill will keep cigarettes out of the 
hands of children, Bobinger said.
Rep. Billy Bowles, D-Houston, said he 
is worried young people could have their 
records tarnished. Will this create a 
record for a child ... that he got caught 
with cigarettes in his pocket? he asked. 
Theyll say lies been a troublemaker 
all his life. 
If somebody wanted to find out 
about it, they probably could, said 
House Judiciary B Committee chair
man Ed Blackmon Jr., D-Canton. It 
shouldnt have an adverse effect on 
somebodys livelihood.
House members and senators had dis
agreed over which court to try children 
in on tobacco violations. An earlier ver
sion designated the youth court, in which 
the convictions would have been kept 
confidential. The final version sent to
day to Gov. Kirk Fordice treats young 
people just as adults. Charges can be 
lodged in local courts, like a county court. 
First-time underage violators would be 
fined up to $75, given 25 hours of com
munity service, and be required to take

Thats up to the parents to raise theyi 
children so they can have self-restraint

But Clark said the state can try to kee 
tobacco from children.
This is a legal product that ought t 
be sold to adults, Blackmon said. Whj 
the parents do, thats going to be ai

Victims relatives observe jury selection in Oklahoma bombing trial
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  Hun
dreds of miles from the Denver court
room where Timothy McVeigh is on 
trial, John Taylor sat in a govern
ment auditorium to watch jury selec
tion unfold.
Taylor and about 30 others were al
lowed to view an electronic feed of the 
trial Tuesday because they lost a loved 
one in the Oklahoma City bombing.
I look at him more as an object than 
as a person, Taylor said of McVeigh. 
Its hard to conceive that someone 
can do what he is accused of, so its 
hard to give him humanistic qualities. 
I look at him almost as if he were 
another piece of furniture.
Taylor and his wife, Gloria, lost their 
daughter in the blast. Teresa Lauder
dale, 41, was among the 168 people 
killed in the April 1995 federal build
ing bombing.
Against the wishes of the defense, 
Taylor and other relatives of bombing 
victims were allowed to view a special 
hook-up of the trial in their home 
state. About 75 people showed up 
Monday; roughly half that number 
arrived Tuesday.
No media have been allowed inside 
the Federal Aviation Administration 
auditorium, where a large screen has 
been set up.
We want to see how the process is,
how they select, the jurors, Taylor 
said. We want to understand the 
process and hear the evidence. We 
want to feel comfortable with the 
jurors. I think we all are interested 
in a fair trial.
The jury selection process could take 
weeks.
While watching, Mrs. Tayior was 
moved to tears when a woman who 
works with learning-disabled children 
recounted her sons recent brush with 
death during a bout of spinal meningi
tis. Number 414,1 really admire her. 
She gave me strength, Mrs. Taylor 
said. I was glad I was here to hear it. 
It was a son for her, a daughter for us.
Thats when the tears began to flow.
She said attending the trial was part 
of the healing process for her and her 
husband.
But the court proceedings could have 
the opposite effect, said a psychologist 
with Project Heartland who has been 
counseling mourners.
Some people look for the trial to 
bring them closure but thats never 
going to happen, Linda Wagner said. 
There will always be something re
lated to the bombing going on for 
many years to come. Instead of clo
sure, what will be important is how 
they integrate all of this and go on 
with their lives.

swing music during Carnival, 
and that Johnny Long would 
sing at the formal ball.
The student body elected seven

 Just before spring break, the 
H&SS College Council met to dis

frequently grew tense as the com

allow students to choose between 
A, B, C, no entry or pass/no entry 
for each class. The committee 
adopted the system, but Dean 
Steinberg rejected the decision.
TEN YEARS AGO, April 7, 
1987  A freak snowstorm

ternities did not complete the 
freeroll requirements, they 
were prevented from participat
ing in the 1987 Sweepstakes; 
additionally, since the fraterni
ties had reserved a lane but 
would not be able to race, they 
were barred from participating 
in the 1988 Sweepstakes as well.
In other news, 1926 Architec

FIVE YEARS AGO, April 6, 
1992  The Sweepstakes Com
mittee changed the buggy roll 
requirements, amidst a slew of 
other new safety requirements, 
making a distinction between 
experienced and inexperienced 
drivers. For the first time, inex
perienced drivers were required 
to have more rolls than experi
enced drivers, with 15 rolls, 10 of 
which had to be done in the raceday buggy.
Several organizations com
plained about the new regula
tions since many rolls had been 
cancelled throughout the term 
due to bad weather. The commit
tee also decided that no excep
tions to the roll requirements 
would be made, although they
had made occasional exception 
in past years.

of details that have to be ad
dressed and attended to, she 
said.
Committee members were also 
unaware of the CMU policy that 
administrative approval is nec
essary seven or eight weeks prior 
to any event in order for it to 
receive confirmation. No one told 
us that was the first step, said 
Velez-Isip.
Committee members were 
given various reasons as to why 
the event could not be held. They 
were told security officials would 
be too busy with Carnival week
end to provide adequate regula
tion for the Ball. According to 
Scheer, committee members sug
gested hiring off campus security 
officials but administrators did 
not agree with this idea. [They 
said] Off-campus security would 
be unfamiliar with CMU regula
tions and it would be necessary to 
debrief them, Scheer said.
It was suggested to us to 
change the name of the ball and

1993. The event has been canceled for this year.
have a smaller, quieter, food-less 
gathering to celebrate the arts, 
rather than a huge party, said 
Free-Bernt. This idea was not 
supported by committee members 
because CFA already holds this 
type of event strictly for CFA stu
dents. In the past, the Beaux Arts 
Ball has always been a large event 
with 700-1000 attendees.
Another suggestion was orga
nizing the ball in conjunction with 
the Jill Watson Festival of the 
Arts. Although this was not pos
sible for this years festival, 
Witchner as well as committee 
members believe this would be a 
possibility in the future.
Aside from receiving final con
firmation from the administra
tion, organization of the event 
was complete. DJs, comedians, 
and performing artists were 
scheduled to appear for this 
event. Performances were sched
uled by Strict Flow, Aw Yeah, 
and DCuckoo, and various other 
bands. In addition, committee 
members were contacting Activi
ties Board (AB) 
Comedies as 
well as CMU stu
dents interested 
in participating 
in the event.
An important 
message to come 
out of this is that 
the University is 
supportive of the 
event many 
staff, including 
myself, have 
worked very 
closely with the 
students since

We have done

everything in our power to make 
[the ball] happen. We had it all 
under control, and its a pity that 
its not happening, said Scheer. 
We hope that this will be a real
ity in the years to come, and that 
the students will not let this tra
dition die, Free-Bernt said.
Many CMU students have ex
pressed great disappointment to
wards the cancellation of this 
years event.
The general consensus is dis
appointment, or discontented 
anger from the people involved in 
pulling it together, said Hadleigh 
Averill, a junior fine arts major 
who was scheduled to perform at 
the ball.
I think its an important event 
especially for seniors who want 
to have something to remember. 
I think its also good because we 
dont have too many activities 
that unite the whole campus,  
said Jennifer Chenk, a senior ar
chitecture major.
I would definitely want to at
tend such an event. Its a very 
important way for other colleges 
to experience CFA, said Stacey 
Swinehart, a freshman design 
major.
I think it is important that 
guidelines are made available to 
those tryingto organize an event, 
said Velez-Isip. Scheer said two 
essentials are faith in the com
mittee and good communication. 
Free Bemt said, It is important 
to cover all of the administrative 
bases before confirming bands 
and performers.
If CFA students would like to 
see the event happen during the 
next academic year in the Spring, 
it is important that a core group 
come forward soon and talk with 
myself as well as Dean Prekop, 
Dean of the College of Fine Arts. 
I also believe that the future 
success of the Beaux Arts Ball 
relies on having underclass stu dents involved so that they can 
easily carry on the tradition, 
Witchner said.

Masses of people gathered outside the courthouse downtown to protest the controversial KKK march.
KKK rallies in Pittsburgh
KKK, from page 1
lumbus, Ohio.
The Klan, which was 
founded 1866, was originally 
a mens club in Pulaski, Ten
nessee and was later reorga
nized with a political and ra
cial agenda.
The groups current name is 
a stemmed from their origi
nal name, Kyklos Klan.
Kyklos is a Greek work 
meaning circle, and clan an 
Irish-rooted term suggesting 
brotherhood and family. The 
KKK historically wears col
ored and white robes to pre
vent identification and to in
still a sense of superstitious 
dread.
This dread and hatred was 
clear when thirty KKK mem
bers stepped out onto on the 
courthouse steps at 2 pm. The 
rally was scheduled for 1 pm 
and protesters grew agitated. 
Some suggested that the Klan 
would not show. I like every
body but the only people I 
dont like are the KKK, said 
John from Schenley High 
School.
The Klan members stood at 
attention and faced the 
penned-in crowd. People be
gan to shout insults as the 
Klan raised their arms in Nazi 
salute. The Klan wore their 
trademark peaked hoods and 
white robes, and all all of their 
faces were covered except for 
Pennsylvania Grand Dragon 
C. Edward Fosters.
Some members wore dark 
green robes, a symbol of high 
rank. Others, Nighthawks, 
wore black robes, acting as 
KKK security.
The crowd saluted the KKK 
with a forest of middle fingers 
and upraised fists.
A neo-Nazi identified as 
Henry Clement wore a Nazi 
helmet, a ski-mask, and a 
black commando sweater. He 
stood waving a red and black 
nazi flag at the opposing 
crowd, 50 yards from the pro
testers beyond the line of po
lice in riot gear.
The crowd began to chant 
Fuck you, Klan with a call 
and response: What do we 
want? Justice! When do we 
want it? Now!
It takes something like this 
[rally] for young black youth 
to wake up, said Pittsburgh 
resident Jay Lo, one of the 
more vocal protesters.
The Klans speeches were in
audible above the noise of the 
crowd. Outside of the main 
pen, groups marched in sup
port of Mumia Du Jabal and 
against White Power. There 
were no injuries and only two 
people were arrested for 
throwing stones.
The cramped quarters and 
occasional rain during the day 
did not stifle any of the en
ergy, anger, and emotion of 
the event. Some were forced 
to frustrated tears as the Klan 
held forth on the courthouse 
steps. Others spread rumors 
that the city paid a $.5 mil
lion to protect the KKK and 
accused the city authorities 
of racism for putting a large 
amount of resources into the 
rally. Youre not welcome 
here! called one woman to 
the Grand Dragon, Foster. 
The city came out in force to 
protest this rally. But many 
were not optimistic.
What kind of city do we live 
in that would allow this kind 
of thing to happen? said Dou
glas Pendergraf, a 
Wilkinsburg musician. We 
cant tolerate the hatred and 
violence that goes on here.
ECE, CS pilot new procedure
REGISTRATION, from page 1
will be done at the same time. This new 
method will also coordinate with the wait
ing list. That way if a non-major tries to 
get into a course where there are only 
reserved spaces open, he/she will be put 
onto the waiting list rather than being 
added to the course.
Although students will not be required 
to use online registration, it will be avail
able to all students including graduate 
students with the exception of incoming 
freshmen. Students will also be able to 
handle standard drop/add procedures on
line, as well.
Prior to 1994 there was never 
aUniversity-wide initiative towards an 
upgraded system of registration. In July 
of 1994, preliminary work began for the 
Enrollment Process Re-Engineering 
(EPR) project.
During these early stages, the EPR did a 
lot of work with focus groups consisting of 
students from every college to help them 
decide what would be the best option for 
the University to pursue. In January 1995, 
the EPR made a formal recommendation 
for student-based online registration.
It took the Enrollment Process Re-En
gineering project to pull the colleges and 
administrative support group together in 
such a way that the time was right to 
develop on-line registration, said Bill 
Elliot, VP for Enrollment Services. As a 
result, the hardware needed to support on
line registration was obtained, and the 
involvement of the academic community 
was rallied for [its] support. As an aside, 
the maturity and acceptance of the World 
Wide Web has added to the success of on
line registration.
I think that before, the institution as 
a whole wasnt ready to move on, said 
Papinchak. People were comfortable 
with the RAD form, and really werent 
ready to change.
After the recommendation was made, 
the group began to work on the specifics of 
the registration process, taking into ac
count many of the issues that the students 
voiced when meeting with them. Before 
we even wanted to think about coding, we 
had to come up with a registration pro
cess, said Papinchak. So what we talked 
about is, How do we make this systematic 
so that it makes sense to students? 
One of the major complaints students
had about the current system was the lack of 
consistent policies that each department and 
college would have to follow. So, included in 
the program are often ignored policies as the 
overload policy. Also, a waiting list based on 
prioritized students will be available. Check
ing for prerequisites will also be automated.
One of the keys was getting Student In
formation up, once we decided we were go
ing to be a Web-based interface, said 
Papinchak. The reason we wanted to do 
that first was because it allowed us to test 
some load on the machines, validate stu
dents by using their Andrew password 
through the AFS file servers, as well as 
getting students used to looking at their 
data. By doing that first, we had a test-bed 
before jumping into on-line registration.
Many students, when mid-term grades 
were released, had trouble accessing Stu
dent Information due to the sheer number of 
students attempting to access the data at 
the same.
They have been evaluating this and have 
determined that sufficient hardware is in 
place, but that they need additional memory 
to handle the load. ACIS, who did Student 
Information, was also tapped to do the 
programming for on-line registration.
Reaction to on-line registration is gener
ally positive. Dr. Robert White, head of 
ECE said, Its great. A lot of our courses 
are very popular, so this will eliminate the 
problem of students lining up overnight to 
get in courses.
Students expressed similar sentiments. 
Traber Campbell, a freshman ECE major, 
said, Im really happy about it. I was worried 
that I might not get into some of my classes, 
and while that may still be a problem, at least 
I wont have to stay up all night to find out.
Carl Meister, a freshman CS major, said, 
Well, it wont be too much different from 
what we did last semester, but anythings 
better than walking around campus from 
department to department and standing in 
lines.
Not everyone, however, is pleased. Alex 
Molteni, a junior architecture major, said, 
I think on-line registration is a bad thing. 
Now people wont get into classes according 
to their dedication but the network speed, 
or if theyre lucky enough to request a course 
when someone else drops it. Its ridiculous.
If the pilot goes well in a week, on-line 
registration will be available to all students 
in November for Spring 1998 registration.
CMU detective fights for religion
...it seems like when I walk into 
the station door; I have to leave my 
faith outside. 
 Raymond Mialki. CMU Detective
LAWSUIT, from page 1
to Mialki, James LaPagha, Chief of Campus Police, and 
Tim Foster, Director of Residence Life, met with a student 
who admitted to doing these things because the students 
knew these actions would cause the detective distress due 
to his religious beliefs. No action was taken against the 
student, and the harassment continued for several months.
Mialkis lawsuit cited another incident related to the 
initial harassment in which he contends Chief LaPagha 
encouraged a resident assistant to file a citizens com
plaint against Mialki because his off-duty relationship 
with students, which involved taking students to con
certs, was inappropriate. Mialki feels this action was
unfair because other _____________________________
officers have off-duty 
relationships with stu
dents, including dat
ing students. Accord
ing to Mialki, some of
ficers in the depart
ment have even taken 
students to strip bars 
and some have hired 
lap dancers for students on these occasions.
Mialkis lawsuit states that students have made slan
derous posts about him to electronic bulletin boards; again 
the University took no action against the students.
Mialki feels he has encountered discrimination within 
the police office as well. The lawsuit states that around 
Christmas time in 1995, Mialki put a small plastic manger 
scene on his desk after he noticed all the Christmas 
decorations in the office were of a non-religious nature. 
Within days, a memo was sent out by LaPaglia requesting 
all non-business items be removed from offices because he 
was going to conduct a formal inspection. According to 
Mialki, after he removed the manger scene, no formal 
inspections were held again even though officers have 
posters and cartoons in their offices.
Its well known where my Christian beliefs are. My 
bumper stickers on my car are very noticeable. I dont 
think Im obnoxious about my faith, but I want to live out 
my Christian faith and if theres a little item like a manger 
that shows where I stand with Christ Jesus, I dont think 
it should create a crisis, said Mialki.
Mialki also claims he has been passed over to receive his faith outside.
teaching certification under the Municipal Police Officer 
Education and Training Act which would allow him to 
teach at police academies.
In response to Mialkis accusations, Lapaglia noted 
that in each case these allegations were, brought up 
before the Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission 
and dismissed. Im the one who promoted [Mialki] to 
detective, he said I would totally disagree that hes being 
treated unfairly. [SIC] Ive given him a lot freedom to do 
his job. Hs a very good detective and I want to see him 
develop his skills further.
Don Hale, vice president of University Relations, in a 
statement on behalf of the University, said, The City of

gated this matter 
and determined 
last year that the 
evidence did not 
substantiate Mr. 
Mialkis allega~____ tions of employ
ment discrimination. The City Commission then closed > 
the case for lack of probable cause. The Federal Equal 
Opportunity Commission subcommittees concur with  
that finding.
Mialki first filed his claim to the Pittsburgh Human 
Relations Commission (PHRC) in 1994. According to 
Mialkis attorney, James Coster, although the PHRC 
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) did not choose to pursue Mialkis case further, 
the EEOC did issue Mialki a right-to-sue letter in 
December of 1996, giving him 90 days to take action 
against the University on his own.
Accordingto Coster, a responsive document is usually 
filed within30days in civil rights cases. IfCMU does not 
respond to the lawsuit, he will proceed according to the 
Federal Courts briefing schedule.
Mialki said, There are different qualities about my 
life as being a Christian, as well as integrity and 
honesty, that I would think the department would feel 
are good to have in a police officer, but yet it seems like

Students should take 
part in elections
Apathetic is a word that has 
been used to label CMU students 
for far too long. People are getting 
tired of it now and besides, things 
have changed. When are we, as a 
large student body, finally going 
to see how shameful this is and 
decide to beat it? Actually, we are 
given the opportunity every year 
in the form of student govern
ment elections  the universally 
accepted yardstick for campus 
activism  and every year, we 
choose to ignore it. As this years 
Student Government elections 
near, students should take the 
time to research the candidates 
and then vote.
Each spring, the same scenario 
is played out at CMU. Participa
tion at elections is so low, among 
voters and candidates alike, that 
CMUs governing positionsare 
decided by a small group of stu
dents. In addition, this attitude 
has pervaded every aspect of stu
dent leadership on this campus 
 the same small group of stu
dents assume the role of organi
zational leaders and liaisons with 
the administration. Students tend 
to forget that student organiza
tions are a major link between 
students and administrators. If 
the four percent of students who 
do vote, end up endorsing Mickey 
Mouse or Yoda, why should the 
administration expect us to take 
things like University town meet
ings and satisfaction surveys se
riously ?
Many people will rationalize
their non-participation in this 
years electons for Student Body 
President and Vice President by 
pointing out that there is only one 
candidate for each position, and 
they are the incumbents. That is 
no excuse; whatever the reasons 
for the lack of canidates are, it is 
just as imperative that we vote. If 
you feel the incumbents have per
formed badly and killed interest, 
go to the polls and let them know 
 theyll probably listen and get 
their act together. If there are no 
other candidates simply because 
no one else even has the guts to 
try, then go to the polls to reward 
the courage of the incumbents 
and spur them to act. Student 
Government welcomes write-ins.
If there are no other candidates 
because students feel the present 
officers have done a great job, 
then go to the polls to reaffirm 
their mandate  give them the 
confidence to speak on behalf of 
the students, to act as their repre
sentative.
The idea of collective responsi
bility is missingfrom thecampus 
community. Yet it is the funda
mental principle upon which the 
success of any community is 
based. Students who feel that 
their opinions and concerns are 
underrepresented should take 
the time to vote in the upcoming 
Student Government election. 
Outlets such as these should be 
taken advantage of; students 
should affect decisions that af
fect them.
Double majors need 
registration priority
Each semester, students major
ing within a department find 
themselves fighting for required 
classes, often with students who 
do not need those classes to gradu
ate. Upperclass students lose class 
space to underclassmen who are 
not as pressured to take classes at 
a certain time in order to gradu
ate on time. In order to alleviate 
the problem, students will no 
longer be able to pre-register for 
Classes as double majors or mi
nors. While this solution solves 
the issue, it creates new problems 
of equal value and sends out a 
recurring message  the Univer
sity discourages students to ven
ture outside of their departments 
to enrich their education.
Since many classes are filled 
almost immediately after they are 
opened to non-majors, it will be 
even more difficult than it already 
is for tdouble majors to fulfill the 
requirements needed for their 
chosen program. Double majors 
will be forced to either stay an
other semester to finish classes, 
or drop their second major to 
graduate on time. Since taking 
an extra semester poses financial 
burdens for many students, a 
double major, which can often 
make a primary major more 
meaningful, will seem unattrac
tive.
Because colleges such as CIT 
and H&SS do not allow freshmen 
to declare their major, double

majors must carefully plan their 
schedules two or more semesters 
in advance. Lack of priority dur
ing registration means that stu
dents who currently in a double 
major program will either be 
forced to drop the second major or 
rethink their graduation date. 
Students should not be forced to 
choose between a timely gradua
tion and a well-rounded educa
tion.
Many tracks within certain de
partments are geared toward get
ting a double major. These tracks 
sound inviting, but if it is almost 
impossible to get a double major 
in four years, many students will 
be discouraged from following 
these paths. If student protests 
are not enough, opposition from 
professors within these depart
ments should be proof of the nega
tive effects of this new policy.
While it is important to take 
measures to ensure that majors 
are able to get into required 
classes with ease, doing so at the 
expense of students wishing to 
expand their education is not the 
solution. Perhaps the Board of 
Deans should consider a system 
of hierarchy where double majors 
and minors have priority over nonmajors, but less priority than ma
jors. By limiting priority to ma
jors only, students are once again 
shafted of their right to recieve an 
education rather than just a mar
ketable skill.
I agree with
Cameron Dezen 100 77-------
percent on the lack of L6tt6f tO
concern from CMU tll6 Ed it Of 
police and the admin
istration about womens safety (CMU 
falls short in publicizing womens safety 
concerns, 3/17/97). It seems that they 
think of it as a burden to provide rightful 
service for women, because we repre
sent such a small ratio here.
Being a freshman, I really didnt know 
or care much about safety issues on 
campus. I always relied on the fact that 
I had a boyfriend and that he would 
always be there to protect me. However, 
something happened about three weeks 
ago that totally changed my views. I was 
walking in broad daylight on Margaret 
Morrison Street around 3 pm. I noticed 
from the corner of my eye this guy in a 
car staring at me as I was crossing the 
street. I didnt think much about it. 
Then he turned his car around and pulled 
over right next to me near the Welch 
driveway. He asked me where the 
Schenley ice rink is and I told him that 
I wasnt really sure. He started rubbing 
his crotch area and asked me where he 
can get a blow job around this area. I was 
so shocked and scared that I asked him 
to repeat his question. He did. I got 
really scared and started running away. 
He chased me with his car and kept 
shouting Do you know what Im saying? 
Do you know what I mean? Finally, 
when some people started coming my 
way, he left.
Trembling with shock, I called Cam
pus Police and all I got was an apatheticsounding woman who didnt seem to 
care about what happened. After listen
ing to me, she just hung up. She said 
nothing like, Dont worry, well send a 
cop right away or Were you physically 
hurt? Frustrated, I called again and 
asked for surveillance around my dorm. 
She said O.K., but I never saw any police 
cars around my dorm that night. My 
story was not even posted on the campus 
alert. It seems that the CMU police 
thought it was just another prank by one 
of the college guys.
The area between Scobell and Welch 
seems to me a very dangerous corner 
because not a lot of people walk around 
there especially at night. The area is not 
even well-lit.
I feel like the whole campus itself is a 
ticking bomb. Something terrible is go
ing to happen soon to some unfortunate 
woman who happened to be at the wrong 
place at the wrong time. This irrespon
sible behavior from Campus Police has 
to stop.

the genres they represent. For The Tar
tan to set aside space for such a mun
dane review is redundant. If the AB and 
SDC Chairs want to inform the campus 
community about the content of their 
movies, why not supply their own pub
licity? In this way, they can avoid what 
they see as blatant misrepresentation 
by another reviewer.
Seeing a movie on campus is a way for 
students to relax and unwind from the 
stress of a hard week. The spirit in 
which The Tartan reviews are written 
reflects that need for an alternative hu
mor that hard work and serious study 
craves. The Tartan has always been a 
newspaper that serves a wide reader
ship, and as such contains a variety of 
editorial material, including humorous 
columns and comics. When John Biggs 
took over the DH 2210 column he insti
tuted a journalistic writing style that 
will serve both him and Greg Marcks 
well. I have used their reviews as ex
amples of what is most exciting about 
contemporary cultural analysis in the 
writing classes I teach at the University 
of Pittsburgh.
To question their potential as journal
ists in this context is not only cheap but 
undeserved.
The DH 2210 review column does not 
infringe on the rights of the students to 
get the best entertainment their Activi
ties Fee can buy, and anyone who feels 
this is the case might consider taking 
themselves less seriously and get on 
with the business of entertainment.

I am writing to 
support the publica
tion of the DH 2210 
column. Rather 
than dissuade the 
campus community
from seeing the films, these reviews uti
lize humor to publicize them in a unique 
way. I suspect that the CMU community 
is not so isolated as to require a serious 
summary of films that have already re
ceived ample press in the popular media 
 and those cult or classic movies have 
achieved their status precisely because 
people are already familiar with them or
major the discriminatory department so 
as to be able to get into the classes they 
need. The departments dedicated to serv
ing undergraduates well and willing to 
accommodate all of their students will 
lose many primary majors. Unfortu
nately, in the way students are counted, 
primary majors are worth much more 
than double majors. In an effort to main
tain primary majors, departments that 
previously did not discriminate will need 
to do so in an effort to keep up the 
number of primary majors. This will be 
detrimental to undergraduate education 
as a whole since it rewards poor service 
rather than providing enough resources 
to serve all undergraduates.
I dont think we can afford to send the 
message that we are not willing to serve 
our undergraduates. This will roll back 
many of the gains we have made in the 
past years to improve the quality of

maj ors priority in registering for classes 
in their double major. I find that this 
policy is an attack against the intellec
tual diversity of the campus and encour
ages departments to provide poor ser
vice to the undergraduates of this insti
tution. I urge students to protest this 
policy vigorously, in an effort to roll back 
this attempt to seriously undermine the 
recent gains made in the quality of un
dergraduate education at CMU.
I think it is obvious why this policy 
discourages intellectual exploration and 
competence in more than one area of 
specialty. Not being able to receive pri
ority in the double major will discourage 
students from attempting to diversify 
their education in meaningful ways, be
cause they will have problems getting 
into the basic courses in their double 
major. Undergraduate education should 
be an exploration of diverse fields, and 
the new policy will prevent any students 
from achieving this goal.
As importantly, this new policy en
courages discrimination and will foster 
poorer service to our undergraduates. 
Only the departments who are unwill
ing to serve all their majors appropri
ately need this policy. Those depart
ments (such as History) which try delib
erately to serve all their majors and 
minors by assuring them places in their 
courses will suffer. Undergraduates will 
be forced to declare as their primary

receive Senate funds, 3/17/97). As 
former president of my sorority, I am 
disappointed that the Tartan Editorial 
Board has insisted on taking a position 
that is so anti-Greek. The statement 
made about Greeks not being irreplace
able represents a completely unjusti
fied and unsupported point of view.
I dont think that the Tartan Editorial 
Board fully understands the roles of 
Greeks on this campus. If no Greek 
houses were to participate in Sweep
stakes, then there would only be four 
organizations rolling buggies at this 
years Carnival.
If no Greek houses were to build a 
booth, then there would only be seven or 
eight booths on Midway. If Greek houses 
all of the sudden decided not to partici
pate, all of CMU would have a really 
lonely Carnival. Greeks deserve a lot 
more credit than the Tartan Editorial 
Board has given.
The Tartan receives the highest allo
cation of student activity fees of all stu
dent organizations, yet we never see 
their buggy or booth. Or the Thistle? 
These organizations along with many 
others, according to the editorial, are 
seeing increasing participation, yet 
where have they been all these years to 
make this campus extra fun during Car
nival? Not on the Midway.
Not during Sweepstakes. Not doing 
cool philanthropic events throughout the 
remainder of the semester. Not doing 
the things that Greeks do.
If these student-funded organizations 
are to be taking the place of Greek houses, 
as the article proclaimed, then they need 
to fill all of the roles associated with 
being Greek. Very few non-Greek orga
nizations do this already.
I hope that the Tartan Editorial Board 
takes this into consideration the next 
time its members take a stroll around 
Midway.

UC elevators frustrate students

Everyone uses elevators. Its a fact of life. Here 
at CMU, we have many opportunities to use 
elevators. Many of the elevators in CMU work 
really well. But one set of elevators in particular 
could be considered an embarassment not only 
to the school, but also to the people who put up 
the money for these elevators.
I have heard some people complain about the 
elevators in Wean being too slow. I would have 
to disagree  we have three elevators servicing 
eight floors. Look how fast the doors open! When 
you press the Close Doors button, they actu
ally do! In fact, the elevators in Wean are incred
ibly fast when compared to the elevators in the 
Holy Grail of campus  the University Center. 
The elevators in the UC are a joke.
Taking the stairs is faster than taking the 
elevator, but the elevator requires less effort. So, 
its a tradeoff  do you walk and get upstairs 
fast? Or do you wait an abnormally long time to 
enjoy the ride?
I was told by someone in the UC that the 
elevators were slow because they only service 
four floors. That cant be true. Hamburg Hall 
has four floors and its elevators are much faster. 
CFA has four floors (not counting the Mezza
nine). Both of these buildings elevators are 
blazingly fast compared to the two in the UC. Go 
totheUC. Press the call button. Watchin amaze
ment as the elevator arrives, and the light goes
out on the button. Yet the doors do not open! Watch in 
astonishment as the down arrow becomes a up arrow 
 and the doors still refuse to open! When they do 
finally open, the doors operate at normal speed. Now 
go inside the elevator, and press 3, or the floor of your 
choice. Press it numerous times. Press the Close 
Door button numerous times as well. It doesnt work. 
Never mind the fact that an axe murderer would be 
finished killing your friend and would begin working 
on you by the time the doors finally start to close. The 
frustration alone can cause one to go homicidal.
And the most frustrating situation of all: You press 
3. You know it will take a while. But you decide to 
deal with the slow elevator anyway. Then at the last 
minute, as the doors slowly close, another person 
jumps in the elevator  causing the doors to open. 
Again. He presses 2.
So, now you have to wait for the doors to close, and 
go up one floor. You see where Im going with this. If 
you have to go up one floor in the University Center, 
use the stairs. It will make life easier for everyone 
(unless youre carrying stuff you cant walk up stairs 
with).
None of this is new  the elevators have been this 
slow since the building opened in the summer. That no 
one has done anything about it is what truly astounds 
me. And now they plan on installing another elevator 
in Baker Hall.
I would propose that in the midst of these plans for 
a new elevator and the refurbishing of the Adamson 
Wing elevator, FMS take the time to tweak the eleva
tors in the University Centerso we can feel like they 
have a purpose beyond driving people crazy.

Prohibition creates more problems than it prevents
James Stepaneck
The Clinton Administration 
recently re-approved Mexico as 
an ally in the War on (some) 
Drugs. We will continue to throw 
foreign aid money at them which 
is contingent on their support in 
arresting drug suppliers.
The House of Representatives 
has passed a resolution which 
disagrees with this on the basis 
that Mexicos former top anti
drug official, General Gutierrez, 
was recently arrested on corrup
tion charges which linked him to 
drug kingpins.
The whole situation is some
thing I consider extremely amus
ing. You have the Clintons ignor
ing corruption (what else could 
they possibly do and be in charac
ter?), Congress withholding a 
bribe because someone else bribed 
the target first, and a whole for
eign policy incident created due 
to a stupid policy.
The only intelligent thing Ive 
heard on the subject was the opin
ion of a Mexican citizen on the 
street.
He was asked his opinion of the 
opposition to Mexicos re-certification as an ally in the face of the 
corruption charges.
The response was pretty simple: 
were not the problem; the de
mand is the problem and its on 
your side of the border.
You see, this is what makes the 
War on Drugs such a load of pu
erile nonsense.
If drugs werent in a state of 
inflated demand due to prohibi
tion, there wouldnt be all the 
smuggling and the huge amount
of corruption in many of the na
tions south of the border.
If the profit wasnt there, the 
crime wouldnt be either.
People in South America 
chewed on cocoa leaves for centu
ries before anyone invented co
caine and crack.
They never had any trouble 
with it.
Then along comes a do-gooder 
and a law against people taking a 
drug of their choice and wham!, 
we end up with more concentrated 
forms ofthe drug which are easier 
to smuggle and more dangerous 
to the health
If you look at the problem 
caused by drugs, almost all of 
them could be attributed to the 
act of prohibition itself.
We tried prohibition once in 
the past and even called it by its 
real name. That was back in the 
20s when we were a more honest 
nation. We realized that an act 
with the scope of a prohibition 
would require a constitutional 
amendment and thus passed the 
21st.
This, as people understood 
then, was what was needed when 
you increased the power of the 
federal government massively.
We created a huge bureaucracy 
to deal with the situation, the 
ATF, which still lingers today 
(and causes all kinds of trouble to 
law-abiding gun owners).
Did we get anywhere?
No, we just caused people to do 
illegally what they formerly had 
done within the law.
This caused a great increase in 
crime and in profits for the crimi
nals.
Now we have repeated the act 
again, but weve broadened it 
even further without even the 
nominal legality of a constitu
tional amendment.
The Drug War involves a mas
sive scale of interference in for
eign states, wholesale violations sive consolidation of police power 
of the rights of U.S. citizens, and in the hands of the federal govmas- eminent.
Hell, if we ran 
the original prohi
bition like we run 
the present one, we 
would have out
lawed beer in 
Canada (and prob
ably started a real 
war).
Yes, I can under
stand that the 
drugs themselves 
arent exactly help
ful to the users.
But neither are 
alcohol, tobacco, or 
caffeine (though 
SCS would prob
ably argue this last 
one with me), but 
we let people use 
these with impu
nity. Why?
We learned our 
lesson vis a vis al
cohol 70 years ago, 
but somehow the 
leap of logic from 
one drug to others 
didnt occur.
The simple 
truth that people 
have to under
stand is that while 
the drugs them
selves may be 
harmful, the act of 
prohibition is 
much worse.

isolated geeks who wouldnt know 
a conviction of any kind if it 
jumped out and blocked our com
puter screens? Of course not.
Well, not completely, at any 
rate.Spend any length of time at 
CMU, and youll see students 
bursting with enthusiasm. Most 
students put their all into schoolwork, extracurricular activities, 
and outside interests. CMU has 
plenty of flourishing (albeit small) 
organizations focusing on activ
ism, such as the College Demo
crats, the College Republicans, 
and, of course, Amnesty Interna
tional. Why, then, does the fair 
name of CMU have to be dragged 
through the mud with countless 
charges of apathy?Although CMU 
students are as motivated and 
dedicated as those in any other 
school on its level, many of them 
focus that energy on purely intel
lectual, artistic, or scientific pur
suits. Social and political activ
ism unfortunately fall by the 
wayside, the intangible equiva
lents of the information on the 
College Democrats that I know I 
had on my desk before countless 
schoolbooks and take-out menus 
shoved it into the dark abyss
where my furniture meets my 
wall. The closest many CMU stu
dents get to feeling compelled to 
think about current events is 
watching out for newspaper dis
pensers to make sure they dont 
collide with them.Dedicated pur
suit of their interests enhances 
the lives of students here a great 
deal. Yet it can tempt them to 
ignore or dismiss as irrelevant 
the social and political issues that 
surround them. Listening to mu
sic youve composed yourself does 
make for a prettier sound than 
listening to politicians argue on 
the nightly news. And its under
standable that if you spend the 
better part of your time talking 
over the Internet with people from 
all over the world and every type 
of ethnic background, concern 
over how we as a nation can im
prove race relations might seem 
kind of a moot point to you. Deep 
involvement with art or technol
ogy or anything else, while ex
tremely commendable, is no ex
cuse for total separation from 
outside affairs. Its disturbing 
how many articulate, opinionated 
CMU students excused them
selves from discussions of the elec
tion last fall with a polite, I dont
know anything about Clinton or 
Dole, Im not voting, and I dont 
much care who wins. Not to 
mention the ones who didnt even 
know who was running and prob
ably wouldnt have batted an eye 
if you told them the presidential 
race was going to be between two 
100-ton chartreuse piranhas. As 
far as Im concerned, anyone who 
makes an uninformed decision 
not to vote deserves to be the butt 
of all those apathy jokes. The 
same goes for the people who 
somehow managed to blunder 
through Pittsburgh last fall with
out once hearing of the John 
Vojtas trial, let alone forming an 
opinion about his acquittal. They 
desperately need to look up and 
figure out whats going on in front 
of their noses  and even partici
pate in it. If all CMU students 
would give social and political 
causes even a fraction of the dedi
cation and thought they give to 
their other interests, this cam
pus would have no trouble at all 
finding its way out of the barren 
wasteland of apathy.

The Uplift of Tibet and Long-Term 
Effects of the Earths Climate
Monday, April 14, 1997 
4:30pm, Adamson Wing 
Lecture Hall, 
Baker Hall 136a
Earth scientists have wondered for years about the origin of the Tibet 
Plateau, the highest region on earth. Until recently, political and 
geographic barriers have prevented scientific investigation of this 
unusual region. Easing of restrictions has resulted in a wealth of new 
constraints on the deep structure of the crust beneath Tibet. The data 
demonstrate that simple plate-tectonic interactions in the upper 
mantle beneath Tibet, coupled with a weak zone in the lower crust, 
arc responsible for creating the plateau. We can now test suggestions 
that the uplift of Tibet has triggered the onset of the monsoon 
weather patterns in the Indian Ocean and has cooled the planet over 
the past 40 million years by drawing out carbon dioxide, a 
greenhouse gas. from the atmosphere as the plateau erodes.

Club team rebuilds
LACROSSE, from page 12
[Other teams] call him the Apache 
[because of his stick], said senior Aron 
Ralston. We call him "biker boy.  
Well be back next year, said jun
ior Justin Bass. Last year was sup
posed to be our rebuilding year . Were 
still building.
Well win on Thursday, CaldwellLaFleur said of their 7:30 pm game 
against Washington & Jefferson.
All and all, I think we did alright, 
said Bass.
It was a good weekend to get out 
and play lots of lacrosse, said junior 
Derek Jander. Its a rough weekend, 
but I like it that way.
I think its cool to have a lacrosse 
tournament here, said CaldwellLaFleur. We have fun. Thats the 
biggest thing. At least I have fun and 
I think the other guys do too.
These places have 40,000 under
graduates and no varsity lacrosse 
teams. It will take awhile to get com
petitive again, but we will, said 
Costanzo We were overmatched in 
this tournament and we really played 
with a lot of character.
The tournament provided the club 
with an opportunity to hone its new 
zone defense. We dont have a lot of 
guys. If we played man-to-man wed 
be pretty run-down, said Jander. I 
think it worked well and we plan to 
use it in the future.
Weve been doing it since Friday, 
said Ralston. It makes our middies 
get back on defense, added Neil 
Simonetti, a grad student.
[Penn State] never did really fig
ure it but, said Costanzo.
Now all we have to do is learn how 
to score, said Caldwell-LaFleur.

TEAM, from page 12
off. Buggies spin out in the chute. And always, there is the 
specter of rain. A lot of time is spent on organization. You 
have to be prepared for anything that might go wrong and be 
able to correct it in a matter of minutes, said TJ Sharpe, 
Beta Theta Pi (Beta) mechanic.
They are obsessed. They spend hours during the week, 
fiddling. Jon Buford, head mechanic for SDC, estimated that 
there are over 1000 man-hours put into SDCs new machine 
(Akula) alone. The shell takes about 200 man-hours to build 
a buggy shell the way that we do it.
We could probably do it in 100, but youve got to have 
breaks for drinking and smoking, said Spirit head mechanic 
Carl Nott. He claims to spend 30 hours a week after spring 
break. Sharpe added, Tires, brakes and windshields  all 
must be given proper attention. If your tires are good but you 
fail a brake test or cant see out your windshield, it really 
doesnt matter, does it?
Buggy hours are crazy, even for CMU students who are 
used to late nights. 4:30 am to 9 am on the weekends, 
anywhere from 10 pm to 3 am on week nights during night 
rolls. Mechanics are driven from within.
I average over 20 hours a week, but there are some weeks 
that I put in over 80. Generally at night is the main time that 
I work, sometimes between 10 and sunup in general, said 
Buford. Sigma Tau Gamma head mechanic Scott Styfco 
added, To quote a t-shirt from a couple of years ago: Sleep 
is for the weak. 
They pay their dues. They build trust and put in time 
flagging and pushing before they can be allowed into the 
secret innards of the buggies. I was asked to come out and 
push one weekend as a pledge, said Styfco, offering his 
personal introduction. After not having run in months, the 
sudden starts and stops got to me, and I threw up by the end 
of the day. As I was sitting down afterwards, I saw one of the 
mechanics taking out the steering, and it looked really cool. 
I asked him about it, and instantly I became the buggy 
bitch. After asking a lot of questions and doing a lot of gruntwork, I moved up in the world from bitch to mechanic.
Some are naturals, fascinated by design or attracted by 
playing with gears and power tools. Deeply affected by 
having to view racism during his high school years, Nott is 
driven by a stronger force. I came to CMU and found out
about Spirit. I found that here was something that I could do 
to make a difference, however small, in the lives of black' 
students on campus. By participating in Spirit buggy, I could' 
help show everyone on campus what dedicated black students] 
could do. Win. Whoever they are and whatever makes themj 
do it, theyre like no others. Mechanics are the much over-' 
looked keys to success; the backbones of buggy.
But there are more components to this fine-oiled machine. The* 
pushers have put in countless hours as well. They train: stairs, 
running, weights. On Saturday morning, many pushers ran fullout sprints with the buggies, then turned around after rolls and' 
participated in the CMU Invitational Track Meet all day. But not; 
all of them are traditional athletes. I dont consider us a veryathletic house, said Jeff Polega, mens push team captain of) 
PiKA. We do have very nice buggies, but it is a testament to our* 
heart that we have won for the past three years.
They are striving for personal and team goals.
The critical hills, on the five-part course, are Hill 1 and Hill 
5. Hill 1 is where legends are made, said Ray Ardire, mensj 
push captain for Beta and Hill 1 pusher. The hill extends from 
the bottom to the crest of Tech Street across from Skibo 
Gymnasium. Pushers start from a dead stop. Mens average 
times vary. I know that average Hill 1 times are around 19 
seconds, and we have a best at like 15.75 seconds in 1995, said 
Jared Simpson, chairman of Beta.
Our best Hill 1 time is Chris Tomforde in 14.89 seconds on 1996 
Race Day 2, said Pika Chairman Paul Warren. Our best Hill 1 is 
approximately 15.2, said Spirit Co-chair Jerry Baptiste.
For Hill 5, which extends from behind Hunt library to thej 
end of GSIA, its a flat sprint. A good shove from the previous' 
pusher is very important for momentum. Anything in low 20s| 
good, said Steve Chiang, Sigma Nu chairman. According toj 
Baptiste, a Spirit pusher once ran in the low 19s on Hill 5.
Everyone will spend the next week training hard on their1 
respective hills as most of the teams have been chosen. Heatj 
assignments were Sunday night and races start Friday morn-1 
ing, bright and early. Race Day is what it is all about, says' 
Sharpe. The competition of Race Day is something that you 
can rarely find anywhere. You have put hours into buggy on; 
the hopes of finding the perfect mix of buggy, driver and; 
pushers, and it all comes down to a two-minute race where the; 
difference between first place and a spin in the chute can be thej 
smallest detail. May the best team roll and win,

pening. You must be kidding me! The

We can question whether auto racing

When evaluating the world of sports, 
one has to wonder what is in the heads of 
some of their fans. Some fans are casual 
sports observers, usually'with a favorite 
team, only paying attention to them if 
they make some sort of post-season play. 
And then there are fanatics, who have 
the season tickets, the DirecTV satellite 
dish for the road games, and all of the 
merchandise that goes along with their 
team. Neither of these cases are bad; both 
are necessary for the future of sports.
And then there are fans of NASCAR. 
The National Association of Stock Car 
Racing has the fastest-growing fan base 
of all professional sports in the United
Tony Yu/Tartan Art Staff
tistic, I was quite intrigued and decided 
to find out what all the hub-bub was 
about. Enter the television.
I had the opportunity to watch a 
NASCAR race on television recently. 
Wow. What incredible pictures of cars 
driving in circles. Look. Nothing is hap
300 pounds. During a discussion on this 
topic during the race, probably because 
nothing was happening except people 
were driving cars, Billy Bob said, Well, 
ya must remember, all of these drahvers work out during the off-season be
cause drah-ving a car for fahve hours
can be a purty tiring experience. Yeah, 
so can watching five hours of cars driv
ing around and listening to two guys 
with the most wicked Southern drawls 
in the universe. Maybe Im an athlete 
too.
Speaking of these people who DO 
watch these cars spin in circles for five 
hours, I was most excited and most in
terested of all when they showed the 
fans in the stands. Incredible. Never 
have I seen 75,000 shirtless Billy Bobs 
crammed into one environment since 
the indoor rodeo was invented in Texas. 
Scantily clad obese men, each looking as 
if theyd had a few too many at the 
barbecue that morning. I dont mean to 
be bashing the appearances and lifestyles 
of NASCAR fans, but now I see why this 
is the fastest-growing spectator sport in 
the United States.
Could it be that all of the prospective 
drivers were so out of shape  even by 
NASCAR standards  that they had to 
become fans instead? That must be it, 
because if these wannabes really are 
fans of this sport, er, game, er, event, I 
am shocked that one can find that much 
enjoyment in an event that stars, as 
Nicole Kidman put it in Days of Thun
der, 40 infantile egomaniacs. My hy-. 
pothesis on why she became a fan at the! 
end of the movie is because she was! 
rooting for the cars themselves.
Thats what I respect in auto racing.! 
Its not a sport, and if people think it is,' 
then the athletes are the automobiles.! 
NASCAR fans shouldnt have favorite! 
drivers, they should have favorite cars.! 
Drivers do nothing but point them in the 
right direction. The cars are running the! 
race, and I could truly care less about] 
whos in them. Kidman was right  all| 
drivers are infantile egomaniacs, because! 
they steal all of the spotlight from thej 
real workhorse, the car.
Whats the point of this NASCAR 
bash? NASCAR might be the fastestgrowing spectator sport, but it really 
should be the fastest spectator event. If 
their fans could only get off of the couch 
and play some REAL sports and breed 
the next Michael Jordans and Wayne 
Gretzkys, maybe there would be no dis
pute to this issue. Although I must ad
mit, it was pretty cool when they crashed.

Super Marios retirement may 
not be that bad for the league
From the Point
By Jason Andracki
Tomorrow night the greatest 
player to wear the Penguins 
black and gold will skate in his 
final regular season game. 
While it may seem odd for a fan 
to say this, I dont see Mario 
Lemieuxs retirement as a com
pletely negative situation.
Sure Lemieux saved hockey 
in Pittsburgh and was a major 
part of winning two Stanley 
Cup, but in the past few years, 
Ive found it hard to respect 
Lemieux. First we have the 
season off, where Mario was 
healthy enough to golf every
day and play in a charity 
hockey game but not enough to 
play for the Pens. Then we 
have Lemieux putting a skate 
in his mouth nearly every time 
he speaks to the media. Hear 
Mario whine about refereeing, 
hear Mario whine abouttrades, 
hear Mario insult another team 
on national television after 
winning the Hart trophy
Most recently Lemieux was 
quoted explaining his recent 
lackluster play by saying he 
was having trouble getting mo
tivated for these last few games of his 
career.
I think Lemieux owes the fans in Pitts
burgh and the hockey world as a whole 
a little more than this.. Pittsburgh has 
greeted Lemieux as the Messiah on 
skates and if not for hockey he would be 
a decent French speaking guy on the 
PGA tour. I think Mario should be ma
ture enough to put his personal issues 
aside and give the NHL one last shot of 
the grace and skill that he has displayed
since October of 1984 when he scored 
on his first NHL shift.
I guess Im being heavy-handed be
cause I feel so strongly about Mario. I 
was never fortunate enough to see 
players like Bobby Orr or Gordie Howe 
play live and I saw the odd Gretzky 
game here and there. But here was a 
legend in his own time that I watched 
blossom from a highly touted rookie 
into arguable the best player of the 
last three decades, right in my home
town.
My fond memories of 
Lemieux far outweigh the 
negative ones. Years from now 
I wont remember his demands 
for trades he approves of, Ill 
remember how he has owned 
John Vanbiesbrouk through
out his career. Ill remember a 
goal scored on Pat Riggen of 
the Washington Capitals when 
the Pens were struggling for 
the first playoff berth in years. 
With minutes remaining in a 
tied game, the Pens needed a 
win rather a tie so the goalie 
was pulled. Lemieux takes a 
pass at the blue and heads to
wards the net with two Caps 
defenders in his pocket. Mario 
was finally pulled down a few 
feet from the net but still, slid
ing on his rear, he chips a shot, 
scoring the game winner. 
Thats what I remember.
Jason Andracki, senior in 
H&SS, hopes the Penguins sign 
at least two star free agents since 
the Pens wont have Lemieuxs 
Mark Adato/Tartan Junior Art Staff lar8e contract anymore.
CMU excels as host
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Contributing Editor
Its been a good competition, said 
senior major Ron Poicawich. But that 
was an understatement. The competi
tion in question, the University Athletic 
Association CMU Invitational, brought 
19 schools to Gesling Stadium. IUP, 
Pitt, and Frostburg were all represented, 
as well as other schools all through the 
Midwest.
Its really dangerous, said senior 
Leslie Brown, regarding her sport, the 
hammer throw. I think to myself God, 
I hope I dont fall and crack my head on 
the concrete.
The men placed first and second in the 
javelin. Its been a long day. said 
thrower Kerrie Riley.
The team also placed first in the 3K 
steeple-chase. Its been fun, said 
Poicawich. He placed first in the steeple 
chase, timed at 9 minutes, 57 seconds.
When asked what he did to prepare for
the UAA, Mark Plesko (Freshman, MCS|) 
said: I went to bed early. I did what th 
coach put on the board: distance days, 
speed days. I mix it up and work hard.!
Plesko came in second in the second 
heat of the 800. Other notables include^ 
Kenn Oldham, who placed first in th 
5K. Kristopher Kriechbaum finished  
close second. Maureen McGranghan 
doubled, finishing third in the 3K.
The stadium was packed with spectaitors and combatants. The weather waj> 
warm and breezy, with occassional show
ers putting a damper on the festivities. 
The meet was one of the largest display 
of track and field competion on campu 
in a great while, and was an exciting 
time for the entire team, especially th 
men, who are now entitled to a dinned 
cooked by the women on the team. Th 
team who scored the most points during 
the invitational would be entitled to  
dinner cooked by the loser. The women, 
it seems, are now out buying Shake n 
Bake.

Sweepstakes fever abounds
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Pi Kappa Alpha brothers were 
at the drop line on Tech at 8 am 
on Wednesday. Pledges, mechan
ics, chairmen, and cloth-enveloped buggies cluttered the side
walk in front of the old gym within 
hours of their arrival. Waiting. 
Couches appeared on the brick 
wall that overlooks Hill 1. Thurs
day: men waiting listlessly all 
day, baby-sitting the now-blue, 
plastic-shrouded buggies. Newly
doesnt keep you warm, said 
Drew Stovall of Delta Tau Delta. 
Pushers are enjoying their few 
precious hours of sleep. Chair
men are fretting. And the me
chanics.... Its Truck weekend.
Truck weekend is the weekend 
before Carnival, when all organi
zations roll to finish qualifying 
their drivers for Sweepstakes. 
Most organizations rent a truck, 
Ryder andU-Haul being the most 
common, to store their buggies  
allowing them to make any nec
essary adjustments on the spot
"I saw one of the mechanics taking out 
the steering... I asked him about it, and 
instantly I became the buggy bitch.   
 Scott Styfco, Sig Tau mechanic
repainted race lines gleamed in 
the warm afternoon sun. In the 
distance, U-Haul truck engines 
hum.
At three in the morning on Sat
urday, a siren from an old fire 
truck wails. Mens chorusing 
voices sing along with it as it 
makes its traditional run up and 
down Margaret Morrison Street. 
The hay bales will be set up soon 
along the chute.
Flaggers rub their eyes. You 
get up at about the same time the 
suns coming up, go outside and 
stand in the cold, and direct traf
fic away from the course. I sup
pose that getting to watch the 
buggies go by is kinda fun, [but] it
while keeping their pushers and 
drivers warm and ready to get in 
the maximum amount of rolls.
The mechanics pace around the 
trucks. Some hover around the 
chase cars (the cars that follow 
the last buggy to roll in each set of 
rolls for an organization). Most 
are smoking. None are smiling. 
All are exhausted.
Mechanics make sure the 
buggy will roll smoothly and fast, 
said Mark Stover, head mechanic 
for Pioneers. Mechanics. They 
share common bonds. No sleep. 
No perks. No rewards until Race 
Day. Even then any freaky little 
thing can go wrong. Pushbars fall

Derek Jander catches the ball against 
Shippensburg last Thursday night.
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
It hurts to walk, sophomore goalie 
Gabe Caldwell-LaFleur said in reference 
to the welts on his arms and lower body. 
The source of the welts: countless shots 
the goalie saved in four games the mens 
lacrosse club played in less than 39 hours 
this weekend. CMU played the games in 
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout, an 
event they co-hosted with Pitt.
It was absurd, he said. Every goal is 
[shot] right on the crease.
In lacrosse, if a missed shot on goal 
goes out of bounds, possession is awarded 
to the team with a player closest to the 
ball when it goes out of play. This rule 
usually results in a race between the 
defending teams goalie and a player on 
the offense. Oftenafter sound defense 
by the Tartans and a save by CaldwellLaFleur the officials would award the 
opponents the ball, even though it ap
peared the goalie beat the other man to 
the ball. They dont like to give the ball 
to goalies, the he said.
Friday night the team was defeated by
Shippensburg 4-2. Jason Louie scored 
CMUs first goal on a play more reminis
cent of an alley-oop than a lacrosse shot.
Saturday we really took our lumps 
15-0 to Illinois, a team I thought we 
could be competitive with, said English 
professor Gerald Costanzo, who serves 
as the clubs head coach. In the after
noon we lost to Virginia Tech 13-2. We 
changed our defense and really played 
very much better against what I think is 
the best team in the tournament.
Sunday morning the team played Penn 
State in the consolation round with only 
four players available for subsitution. 
Lacrosse teams consist of nine-man 
teams plus a goalie. The three mid-field 
positions make continuous shifts, as in 
hockey, and its usually beneficial to 
give the three defenders or three for
wards an occasional rest. The hoard of 
Penn State players were victorious 7-2. 
CMUs two goals were scored consecu
tively in the third quarter by junior Jay 
Miolla, who has become known for his 
physical play. During the loss to the 
Illini, Miolla flattened a player at mid
field with a head-on collision.

Carnival provides a network of fun
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Where else could you see sumo wres
tling, human bowlers, a hypnotist, and 
television shows springing up as interac
tive 3-D figures? You guessed it: Spring 
Carnival 1997.
Carnival will be held this Thursday 
through Sunday under the theme televi
sion shows. The slogan is Warning: May 
Contain Racy Scenes, Graphic Displays
& Adult Rides. With everything it has to 
offer, Carnival is sure to satisfy both the 
Pittsburgh and CMU communities.
Carnival is in some ways always, the 
same and in some ways always differ
ent, said Christa Sherwood, a senior 
bachelor of humanities and arts major
and the Spring Carnival chair. This 
years Carnival has several returning 
performers and activities, as well as 
several new performers and events.
In the past, its been usual to have a 
big comedian on Saturday night, which 
we dont have this year, but this year we 
have two bands which are more main
stream and more famous probably, said 
Patience Moreno, a junior math major 
and the SDC Tent chair.
According to Amy Ondos, a junior 
chemical engineering major and Enter
tainment chair for Carnival, this years 
highlight will probably be these con
certs to be held on Friday night. We 
brought both Brownie Mary and The 
Clarks, which I think will be a great 
night, Ondos said.
Besides the major concerts, there are 
many more great entertainment events 
lined up for this weekend. Hypnotist 
Mark Pittman will be performing on 
Thursday night, with members of the 
audience being brought on stage to be 
hypnotized. Also, according to Brian 
Leet, a senior architecture major and 
Carnival Publicity chair, comedian Marc 
Moran will perform in the-SDC Tent on 
Saturday night. Moran is returning for a 
repeat performance at CMU after a very 
successful show at this years Home
coming. The closing act for Carnival, 
following Morans performance, will be 
ventriloquist Dan Horm, who has been 
seen on several national television 
shows, such as Comic Strip Live and

Booths build on team spirit
By CARRIE JONES-MCGUIRE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Ah, the sweet hum of circular saws in the spring
time. Thats the noise that Morewood Gardens 
residents and the surrounding neighborhoods are 
hearing as 28 student organizations start down the 
final stretch in booth preparations, getting ready 
to take their places on the Midway. Groups com
pete for first, second, and third prizes in each 
division, as well as the Chairmans Choice award.
This years theme, television shows, was chosen 
by a committee of organizational booth chairmen 
in the middle of last semester, and organizers are 
pleased with it. TV shows cover just about any
thing, said Brian Lam, a junior in social and 
decision sciences and Sigma Phi Epsilons booth 
organizer. It frees us up a lot.
It was a good choice, something we could have a 
lot of fun with, said Elizabeth Brode, a sophomore 
industrial management major and Kappa Alpha 
Theta sister.
However, there was an unexpected difficulty 
with the theme. All television shows are trademarked, so weve had some trouble with the Tshirts, said Jenna Yerger, midway chairman. Its 
been dealt with, but it took a while.
These difficulties dont seem to slow people down. 
Many organizations spend weeks or even months 
on their booths, brainstorming, building, and paint
ing. Delta Gamma started building its mockup of 
Mels Diner from Alice the week before spring 
break. The tridelts started planning their booth, 
the bottle from I Dream Of Jeannie, based on the 
design of a Mongolian yurt, in January.
Its a lot of hard work, said Clifton Forlines, a 
junior design major and Fringe booth chair. I have 
welts on my shoulders from carrying lumber. Your 
hands get chewed up, you inhale a lot of nasty 
fumes and [get] splinters galore.
Peng Huang, a senior in architecture and SARCs 
Carnival chair, found the experience includes lots 
of planning and teamwork.
There are a lot of big booths this year. Its 
amazing how hard they work, said Yerger. We 
require 40 hours of Midway watch and cleanup 
from each organization, plus booth meetings every 
week, planning the booths and the games, and the 
actual construction.
Planning also extends to environmental con
cerns. We have guidelines encouraging recycling 
and environmentally friendly materials, said 
Yerger. Some groups sell their booths after Carni
val, and most recycle their lumber. Were using 
walls from last year, said Melissa Myers, an in
dustrial management senior and Delta Gamma 
sister. We store stuff and reuse it. This eases the 
burden on both the environment and the groups 
budget.

Letters to Cleo and Angry Salad on 
Saturday. Brownie Mary and The Clarks 
on Friday. Comedians Marc Moran and 
Dan Horm on Saturday. As the Chair of 
the Carnival Entertainment Committee, 
junior chemical engineering major Amy 
Ondos is responsible for determining when 
and where all these acts will perform. For 
this weeks edition of On Campus, she 
answers The Tartans questions about 
Carnival and her position.
The Tartan: How do you think this years 
Carnival compares to previous years3 Car
nivals?
Amy Ondos: I think the excitement level 
is still there. But I think at Carnival, people 
will enjoy all of the entertainment because 
its all very good. People have heard of the 
bands, I think its just overall balanced with 
good entertainment.
IT: What are you doing to make this 
year's Carnival different?
AO: This year the specialty events are 
coming back. Like the bungee run and the 
joust. We have typically the same format 
... but we also have a wide variety of 
different types of music going on.
IT: Whats the funniest thing youve ever 
seen at Carnival?
AO: Watching Phi Kappa Theta carry
their booth down and setting the roof 
down twice in the middle of Forbes 
Avenue. I think the entire house, prob
ably about 40 or 50 of them were car
rying it, and in front of the Alumni 
House they put it down. They put it 
down again in front of the Morewood 
parking lot entrance. There were two 
police cars behind them, and I dont 
remember how far traffic was backed 
up. Theyre building the Sherlock 
Holmes house.
TT: If you could see one accident 
happen at Carnival, what is the funni
est thing you can think of?
AO: Probably somebody falling off 
the stage.
TT: What kind of preparations have 
to be made for the band?
AO: A lot of tech support  the tech 
chairs have to go through and see what 
they have and see what the band needs 
and get rental equpiment. Since both 
bands were local we didnt have to take 
care of hotel and food and things like 
that. It would be just another little 
thing to worry about. We rent the tent 
and the stage each year, and we just 
had to make sure the setup will be large 
enough for the band.
TT: What improvements do you think
need to be made to Carnival overall?
AO: I think if it wasnt on a Thursday 
night more of the local community would 
be able to come. A lot of the local commu

Mobot makers get ready for Carnival weekend
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Production Manager
Small mobile robots will be taking 
over the sidewalk in front of Doherty 
and Wean Hall during Spring Carnival 
this weekend  accompanied by their 
builders, of course.
Ten to 12 robots built by CMU stu
dents and community members are ex
pected to enter the third annual Mobot 
slalom race, to be held next Friday at 
11:30 am. Two individual entries and 
one team competed in the preliminary 
competition last Wednesday.
Presented by the School of Computer 
Science, and sponsored by SCS, RedZone 
Robotics, and Schlumberger, the Mobot 
competition began in 1995 to provide 
technically-inclined students the chance 
to gain hands-on experience in a cre
ative atmosphere and to round out Spring 
Carnival, accompanying the traditional 
booth and buggy competitions. The 
buggy races, while exciting, have tech
nologically run their course, said An
drew Gruss, a systems scientist in the 
Computer Science Department and one 
of the judges for the competition. We 
thought this might be a more technical 
outlet for engineering students.
The creativity and ingenuity of the de
signers were evident in their designs in 
the preliminaries; the only common thread 
between the three entries in the prelimi
naries was the task before them: the suc
cessful negotiation of an approximately 
260-foot slalom course, passing through 
14 wicket-style gates on the way.
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
Race participants stop their Mobot mid-course to make final changes.
In fact, the team of psychology se
nior Huey Lin and electrical and com
puter engineering sophomore Jeff 
Brown continued making adaptive 
modifications up to  and in between 
 the three competition heats. Due to 
an unusually bright sun on the day of 
the preliminaries, they added a large 
square light shield to the front of their
Mobot. It uses IR light to navigate, 
explained Brown. The sun bombards 
the course with IR.
Lin and Browns Mobot also had some 
difficulty negotiating the first ramp due 
to the steepness of the slope, but they 
have plans in the works for a braking 
system. As a makeshift brake, they tied 
a keychain to the back of their Mobot
prior to the third heat, which slowed it 
down somewhat but not enough to 
successfully complete the turn on the 
ramp.
Particularly challenging is the last 
leg of the course, in which the Mobot 
must make a series of decisions about 
which path to take. The first Mobot to 
to run the course, entered by Daniel 
Bothell, performed well on the single
path portion of the course but balked 
when it reached the first branch. 
Bothell, who is in his third year of 
competition with the same Mobot, ex
plained that it does not have a mecha
nism for making decisions. It was, 
however, well-adapted to varying 
weather conditions; Bothell mentioned 
that the sun was a particular problem 
during last years final competition.
The goal of the Mobot competition is 
to successfully pass through as many of 
the 14 gates as possible in the least 
amount of time. In the final competi
tion, cash prizes will be awarded to the 
first-, second-, and third-place entries 
in the undergraduate category, and to 
the winner of the Open Class tourna
ment which is open to anyone affiliated 
with CMU. A Judges Choice award 
may also be presented to an entry which 
is particularly unusual, entertaining, 
or noteworthy in some way according 
to the official rules. Mobots cannot be 
radio-controlled or otherwise assisted 
by the entrants in any way once they 
have passed the zeroth (start) gate 
and must complete their run in no more 
than four minutes.

BOOTHS, from page LI
Most agree that all the hard work pays off when Midway 
finally lights up on Thursday. Its really hectic in the begin
ning, but then it becomes a lot of fun, especially when its up and 
running during Carnival, said Lam. We all enjoy looking back 
at the job weve done, said Forlines.
Booth brings us together as a house, said Brode. When every 
sister in the house is carrying a wall across campus, and you know you 
couldnt carry that wall alone, it really fosters a sense of community. 
The end results range from the expected to the incredibly 
elaborate. Sigma Nu will offer its 99 percent recycled booth 
from years past with goldfish as prizes.
The Hockey Club will also present its usual fare. Were doing 
our traditional crowd pleaser: a hockey shoot-out, said Jessica 
Strelitz, a junior in English. Some things are just built to last. 
Sigma Phi Epsilons theme is The Dukes ofHazzard. Watch 
out for the bright orange General Lee crashing toward you, said 
Lam. KDR is building its booth around the theme of The 
Twilight Zone. SARC plans to simulate Speed Racer's garage 
and training room, complete with buggy simulator. Delta 
Upsilons booth is based on Indiana Jones.
Phi Kaps two-story mockup of Sherlock Holmes London 
house weighs almost four and a half tons, and will include 
antiqued furniture, wall sconces, and a hardwood floor. Their 
prizes will be hand-dipped chocolate magnifying glasses.
All are looking forward to kicking back for a weekend and 
taking some time to admire their hard work. I think students 
are about ready to explode and cut loose, said Forlines. The 
best thing about Carnival is that CMU turns into a normal 
university for a whole weekend!
Carnival is a chance to see professors in a more casual 
setting, maybe with their kids, and to connect with the commu
nity, said Brode. Its when you see the kids out there on 
Carnival weekend that you really feel its worth it.
Yerger is pleased with this years efforts. Weve got great 
people doing booths. And with rides and entertainment, if the 
weather holds, it should be great.
See you on Midway.
Female drivers display dedication
By SUSIE CRIBBS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Its an average Saturday morning, 
and while the rest of the CMU campus 
is sleeping peacefully after a rough week, 
clocks and phones are sounding their 
alarms in some rooms across campus. 
Its 4:30 am, and women drivers climb 
out of bed and into buggies.
As the anticipation for Carnival and 
the work involved in preparation for the 
annual buggy races come to a head, it is 
worthwhile to reflect upon the unseen 
female guides of the infamous buggies 
and what exactly it is that they experi
ence.
. A driver has to go through a sort of 
.torture. First, because the cockpit is so 
small, they must wear very tight cloth
ing in order to fit into the space. They 
also have to don goggles, a biking hel
met, gloves, and a required safety appa
ratus. A driver must then lay on their 
stomach in the approximately 7-foot 
long, 2-foot wide, 1.5-foot high buggy, 
where they are strapped in by their 
mechanics. Once in the buggy, drivers 
maneuver their vehicles using various, 
usually secret, methods to steer and 
brake down hills.
With all of these requirements, a per
son must be on the short side and very 
light to be a buggy driver. Even though 
drivers can be of any sex, female buggy 
drivers are more common because of 
these two requirements. Even so, it is 
difficult to find one person with both of 
these requirements, so organizations 
are constantly on the lookout.
Kerry McIntyre, a senior chemistry 
major and a 4-year driver for Kappa 
Delta Rho, remembers being helped to
move into her dorm as a freshman by the fraternity brothers 
because she was small and could be a potential driver. They 
asked her to drive shortly thereafter.
McIntyres situation is not an uncommon one. Other 
potential drivers have been approached at the fall Activities 
Fair of their freshman year, while some had friends in 
organizations that needed drivers and brought the two

This PiKA Buggy is an example of what drivers have to fit in.
together.
But there are qualities beyond 
height and weight that constitute 
a good driver. A good driver is 
someone who is willing to learn 
the detail about driving a buggy... 
[and] who is dedicated to driving
 who is willing to make the com
mitment. This is the key to a good 
driver, said Steve Chang, a sopho
more architecture major and 
buggy chairman of Sigma Nu.
The buggy driver also needs t 
be excited and positive about what 
they are doing. If she is willing t 
come out and has a good attitude, 
that is the best, said Jared 
Simpson, a senior industrial man
agement major and buggy chair
man of Beta Theta Pi.
Once a buggy driver volunteers 
to become a driver, the work be
gins. An average Saturday during 
the spring semester involves wak
ing up at 4:30 or 5 am. Buggy 
drivers then venture into the dark 
to do what they call drops, which 
involve being released on a hill 
and told to break and release at 
certain intervals to test the brakes. 
After drops, drivers wait until the 
sun comes up and then walk th 
course with their chairman (who 
is responsible for the organization 
of the specific groups buggy prepa!- 
ration) and then rolls of th 
course itselfbegin. After anywher 
between three and four rolls, th 
buggy drivers return home at 
roughly 9 am.

Ok, so you say, What the heck is this 
Buggy thing? Well thats really not the 
easiest question. To many people it is 
many things. To some, it is just a pain in 
the rear because it blocks roads and 
interferes with their driving and parkingon some evenings and weekend morn
ings. To others, it is a curious event in 
which people race odd-looking vehicles 
around Schenley Park once a year (Are 
there really people in those things?). To 
those of use who were stung, it is an 
obsession and a way of life.
Buggy (or Sweepstakes, which is the 
formal title for the event) is a curious 
combination of technological application, 
physical prowess, and the skill of certain 
women who are small enough to drive 
the things. Much is made of the impor
tance of the buggy technology and havLisette Miller-Dlxon/Tartan Photo Staff

driver is the difference between winning avail you naught.
There are two main schools of buggy 
design at the present. There is the one 
wheel in front, as in the Spirit design, 
which is merely an evolutionary progres
sion towards a more aerodynamic design 
of the standard one-wheel-in- front buggy. 
This is a straightforward adaptation of 
the design originated in Legend, the first 
three-wheel buggy. For this reason Ill 
refer to these as Legend style.
The other advanced design is the two 
wheels in front, completely enclosed 
teardrop design. Two wheels in front 
buggies have been around for quite a 
while with examples from SDC, Fringe, 
Phi Kappa Theta, CIA, and Pioneers. 
The Fringe example, Lunatic, was com
pletely enclosed in a shell and possibly 
inspired Sigma Nus Jama which was 
the first of this type to make the top five, 
with a third place finish in 1990. Since 
Fringe dismantled Lunatic to make it 
Legend-style, I will refer to these bug
gies as Jama style.
Spirit has had their design imitated 
by many organizations, including Phi 
Kappa Theta and SDC. Spirit first 
stunned observers with a course record 
of 2:06.2 with Quantum Leap in 1988 
introducing this design. Phi Kappa Theta 
managed to come in second in 1994 and 
third last year with their entry, showing 
what has evolved into a solid position as 
one of the top buggy organizations.
The progenitor of the Jama type, 
Sigma Nu, has had a disappointing 
string of showings for the last two 
years. Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) won last 
years Sweepstakes with a buggy of the 
Jama type. This is pretty impressive 
in that its their third consecutive year 
to win the trophy. Since PiKA has 
made such an impressive showing with 
buggies of this type, a number of other 
organizations have adopted the style.

Yes, its time for Sweepstakes 
again, and it looks like were in 
for another great weekend of 
races.
Ill begin my predictions this 
year with some Buggy history. 
Sweepstakes 94 saw Spirit go
ing for their fourth victory in a 
row, only to be upset by PiKA. 
Sweepstakes 97 is a major case 
of deja vu, but this time the 
roles are reversed. I also be
lieve the outcome will be re
versed, too.
Instead of Spirit being upset, 
they will be the upsetters. They ve 
always had great push teams, 
and this year is no exception. 
They have a team that can more 
than compensate for the minor 
ground that PiKA typically gains 
in the freeroll. Its always been a 
good battle between these Sweep
stakes power-houses, but look for 
Spirit to come out on top this 
year.
Coming in behind PiKA and 
Spirit ought to be Phi Kap. 
They should round out the top 
three based on their over
achieving push team.
SDC will continue to impress 
by placing in the top five. This is 
an organization that always 
manages to put on a great show, 
considering the multiple other 
activities in which it partakes. 
SDC has a special 
place in

someday that

Sigma Nu, contrary to their re

Sigma Nu could be the sleeper

What do you think of when you hear 
the name Albert Einstein? Perhaps its 
his native Germany. Or maybe you con
jure an image of government think tanks 
and testing grounds. However much (or 
little) you know about the man and his 
theories, did you think of Pittsburgh? If 
you are familiar with the criticism which 
his theories underwent in the scientific 
and educational communities, you 
should have.
Such criticism is the scope of the lec
ture series The Woman, the Priest, the 
Reverend and Einstein: The Theory of 
Relativity in Pittsburgh. The series is 
the offering of this years Romanell-Phi 
Beta Kappa Lectures which are deliv
ered by a scholar who is chosen annually 
to be the Romanell-Phi Beta Kappa Pro
fessor of Philosophy.
Clark Glymour is the recipient of 
this years professorship. In his duties 
as the Alumni University Professor of 
Philosophy of CMU, Glymour met the 
criteria of Phi Beta Kappa; these crite
ria focus on distinguished achievement 
in the field of philosophy and contribu
tion to the public understanding of 
philosophy.
Glymours lecture series has been di
vided into three parts. In each of the onehour lectures, a story would be told of
someone in the Pittsburgh area who 
supported an Einsteinian theory and 
discredited a colleague who refuted it.
The first lecture given last Wednes
day followed this format. However, ad
justments were made to the rest of the 
series.
The first lecture, entitled The Woman 
Who Saved Relativity, related the story 
of Adelaide Hobe. As an assistant at the 
Lick Observatory, Hobe discredited the 
director of the Allegheny Observatory in 
his efforts to refute Einstiens theory of 
gravitation.
In 1915, women were not permitted to 
work above assistant level in laborato
ries or observatories. Their tasks were 
limited to calculations and measure
ments. Despite this adverse environ
ment, Hobe was able to find a forum to 
argue in support of Einstein.
This opening lecture received some 
negative reactions from its audience. 
He took too long with the story of this 
woman and not enough time with tech
nical information, said J.P. Balash, a 
retired alumnus of CMU. Due to this 
lack of audience enthusiasm for emo
tional stories, the second lecture, given 
last Thursday, was replaced.
Originally entitled How the Presi
dent of Duquesne Refuted Einstein, the 
second lecture was to explain how the 
theory of relativity was treated as 
amoral. The book Euclid or Einstein?,
written by the president of Duquesne 
University in the 1930s, claimed to prove 
that the general theory of relativity was 
inconsistent.
In the absence of this lecture, Glymour 
gave another entitled Causation, 
Mechanism, and Probability. While the 
subject of this lecture did not follow the 
format of the series, it did please those 
who had attended the first lecture and 
were disappointed by its lack of techni
cal content. The lecture went over some 
general theories of causation in psychol
ogy, and consisted of separating alter
nate effects from possible causes and 
identifying mechanisms through which 
causes induce effects.
[Thursdays] lecture is the real meat, 
said Balash.
On the other hand, a few members of 
the audience were unable to follow the 
more mathematical content. Glymour 
admitted that each of the first two lec
tures had some imbalance in content.
You can put your hankies away [from 
last time], but you may need a stimulant 
in their place, said Glymour.
The third and final lecture, scheduled 
for Monday at 4:30 pm in the Adamson 
Wing, is entitled Relativity, Probabil
ity, and the Impossibility of Science. 
The lecture will relate Bayesian statis
tics to the theory of relativity and is 
scheduled to stay with the original in
tent of the series.

PREVIEW, from page LI
Evening at the Improv.
In addition to the eclectic lineup of 
performers, there is a large variety of 
activities at this years Carnival. Sev
eral booths pertaining to the theme of 
Television Shows will be found on 
Midway, such as Kappa Kappa 
Gammas Dinosaurs! booth and 
Lambda Sigmas Family Feud booth. 
Rides, such as the popular bumper 
cars, will also be found on Midway, 
and tickets for these rides are on sale 
this week until Thursday at the Uni
versity Center Information Desk for 
half off the regular price.
A Carnival Within a Carnival will 
be featured on Saturday afternoon on 
the Cut. In the past, they used to 
have a major event to tie [the time 
between] the Sweepstakes races and 
the opening of Midway, said Tom 
Gilbert, a senior materials science and 
engineering major and the Saturday 
Event chair.
Since such an event was absent from 
Carnival for several years, Gilbert said 
that this year they decided to bring 
such an event back and decided on a 
Carnival Within a Carnival. Accord
ing to Gilbert, this event features sev
eral large inflatable games and ac
tivities, such as sumo wrestling, hu
man bowling, the Gladiator joust, 
bungee run, and laser tag. Laser tag 
will consist of four players per team. 
[This is] a new form of laser tag thats 
supposed to be much better because 
you dont have to wear all the gear you 
used to have to wear; you just have 
your gun, said Sherwood.
Also, at noon, as part of this special 
Saturday event, a 100-foot-long hoagie 
will be available for free on the Cut. 
The committee hopes the event will 
create a bridge between Sweepstakes 
and Midway. We want to keep the 
energy up and keep people excited, 
said Gilbert.
We made an effort to [also] recog
nize that there are a lot of things that 
are happening on campus that we dont 
organize but which are an important 
part of Carnival weekend, Leet said. 
These activities include a show at the 
Hewlett Gallery, the Mobot race fi
nals, and a senior voice recital by 
soprano Rachael Gates in the Alumni 
Concert Hall.
All the Carnival festivities will be
gin on Thursday at 5 pm at the 
entranceway of the Morewood Gar
dens parking lot, with a ribbon cut
ting by Bryon Krug, the student body
president. The Bagpipe Band will then 
lead the procession around Midway, 
ending at the Midway stage where 
they will perform. Their performance 
will be followed by the Kiltie Band in 
the Main Tent. It should be a great 
performance. Weve put in a lot of 
work this semester, and it should pay 
off, said freshman Brandon Paluzzi, 
a math major and member of the Kiltie 
Band.
Throughout Carnival, there will be 
a valet parking service available for 
the Morewood Gardens parking lot to 
help fit cars into the lot, according to 
David Pinkus, a junior IDS major 
and the Carnival Parking chair.
[We] tried to keep more people 
informed on the parking situation 
this year, Pinkus said.
This Monday, giveaways of items such 
as bottle opener keyrings, frisbees, plas
tic cups, and lollipops begin at the Car
nival table outside of Doherty Hall or 
inside Kirr Commons if its raining. Ac
cording to Leet, students can pick up 
these giveaway items and buy t-shirts 
and mousepads to further their Carni
val excitement.
I think its going to be a great Carni
val, and I hope a lot of people come out to 
it, said Sherwood.

ANALYSIS, from page L3
Delta Upsilon was the first to copy 
this design from Sigma Nu, even 
before PiKA did. Last year, Beta in
troduced one of this type, and this 
year SDC has a new buggy of this 
configuration. In a curious modifica
tion on this theme, PiKAs newest 
buggy has two wheels in front, but 
one of them is exposed. This appears
it that Sigma Nu may have pulled a 
fast push team out of their hat, but 
this remains to be shown on raceday 
since their A push team was plagued 
by problems during Truck Weekend. 
Phi Kap has also been straggling a bit 
off the top people. However, they man
aged a full course time up there with 
the two contenders.
Of course, the two contenders, as
Chris Cannon/Tartan Sports Editor 
Truck Weekend helped determine Spirit A as the probable Sweepstakes winner.
to be so that the other two wheels can 
be in a straight line without having 
a huge frontal area.
Ok, now for what youve all been 
waiting for, whos going to do what 
this year. Interestingly enough, Im 
not quite sure. After observing a num
ber of freeroll weekends, hearing ru
mors, and watching both days of Truck 
Weekend, Im pretty well-informed. 
Im also pretty well-confused about 
the outcome.
Let me try to guess the top 10 con
tenders first. Well theres SDC, who 
are rolling fairly fast, but considering 
what Ive seen, I almost expect a spin 
from them. However, I do expect them 
to put something in the top 10, but Im 
not expecting top five. Also their new 
Jama-style buggy hasnt performed 
too well, so they apparently have a 
bunch of bugs to work out. Pioneers 
also looks to make top 10, but consid
ering I havent seen a truly inspiring 
roll from them this season, top five is 
an off chance. Beta has shown little 
promise in rolls, but I predict that 
their push team will drag them into 
the top ten, barring horizontal rota
tion. Sigma Nu has also not shown 
their once-normal high speed. They 
have been pretty fast, but not quite up 
there with the top people. Rumor has
always, are PiKA and Spirit. This 
year is a bit more complicated than 
the past two, since both teams have 
been on the ball and rolling fast. 
Last year, Spirit was outmatched 
in competency by PiKA, but this 
year they seem to have their act 
together. PiKA, as always, is on the 
ball, but then do they have the push 
team? The best facts I have to make 
a prediction on are full course times 
from Truck Weekend, and even 
those are too close to call.
Its really up in the air this year, 
but if I had to make the call, Id go 
with Spirit since I think theyre 
finally due (unlike last year). Let 
me round out my speculation for 
top ten.
1. Spirit A
2. PiKA A
3. Phi Kap A
4. Sigma Nu A (if the push team is 
there).
5. Spirit B
6. SDC A
7. Pioneers A
8. Beta A (B, whoever doesnt spin).
9. Sigma Nu B (they seem to have 
depth this year).
10. PiKA B (their B teams have 
been weak recently).

DRIVERS, from page L3
many unseen trials for the driv
ers. One of the primary problems 
is the drivers position in the 
buggy, where they must lay flat 
on their stomachs with their arms 
extended. Aching arms and shoul
ders from this position can be a 
nuisance.
Bruises are inevitable. You al
ways have bruises, says Danielle 
Monteleone, a freshman math 
major. Hitting bumps in the road 
can also cause problems.
Sometimes [I] hit bumps, and 
I keep my tongue rolled, up so I 
dont bite it by accident said 
Michelle Griffith, a freshman bi
ology major.
In addition to the bumps and 
bruises, being in the buggy it
self can sometimes be discom
forting. Push practice [when 
the driver merely sits in the 
buggy and people push] is very 
boring for the drivers, and be
ing in a buggy is lonely, said 
one anonymous driver.
Being in a buggy also allows 
the drivers to understand how 
the machine works so they 
know when something is right 
or wrong with the buggy. Some
times the organizations dont 
always want to listen to them. 
You run out of patience some
times and its frustrating  
you have a lot of knowledge. If 
something doesnt feel right, 
you know, and sometimes they 
dont listen to you, said an 
anonymous driver.
There are also times when 
there are what can only be 
termed as bad buggy experi
ences. One drivers goggles 
fogged and she was unable to 
do her rolls until they could be 
defogged  a frustrating ex
perience for all involved. An
other driver relates a story of 
having a coughing fit in a buggy 
and having to wait until her
more comfortable, said 
Griffith.
Beyond the minor problems, 
most drivers find the entire pro
cess rewarding and fun. How do 
you know what itsgoing-to be 
like to be put in this little thing 
and shoved down a hill an inch

Kerry McIntyre has driven Buggy for Kappa Delta Rho for four years.
team could remove her from it. 
Yet another driver remembers 
a time when her pushers were 
not ready to catch her. When 
she lost momentum on a hill 
and there was no one to push 
her, she started going back
ward down the hill. But even 
though these bad experiences 
have occurred, there is no fear 
of lack of safety on the part of 
the drivers. There is a commit
tee of people in charge of all 
aspects of safety and they fol
low strict guidelines. Know
ing that theyre so careful and 
take things so seriously I feel
off the ground? said Marissa 
Arney, a freshman chemical en
gineering major.
Despite this, all report having 
had great experiences. Buggy has 
turned into something they dont 
mind waking up for at 4:30 am on 
a Saturday.
I have become better friends 
with a lot of people, said Ashley 
Morris, a junior civil engineer
ing and information and deci
sion systems major. I get to 
experience the fun only a select 
few students get to experience. 
I wouldnt give it up for the 
world.

Boston bands 
rock the Cut
Italian director scares audiences
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter 
& DAVID BAZELON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The camera as character. There is perhaps 
no better way to describe the method Dario 
Argento uses to unleash his horror-cumgothic nightmares to the screen. To step into 
an Argento movie is to step into a dream, 
replete with dark imagery, hyper-surrealis
tic colors, and ear-piercing atmospheric 
sounds. The camera has a mind of its own. It 
roves and tracks above beautiful architec
tural landscapes and then zooms in to a 
tortured reflection in a pool of blood. To say 
that his imagery is without motivation is an 
understatement. But it is the subconscious 
link to the long dark hallway and the mad
man behind the door that gives power to his 
probing camera and takes root in the audi
ences mind.
Typically, horror movies have been all 
about squeezing reactions from the audi
ence. Some directors make up a whole style 
to make you scream or jump. Artistic sensi
bilities are not usually associated with hor
ror films. Until Dario Argento came into the 
genre, all that mattered was how much 
blood was on the screen. Argento did to gore 
what Peckinpah did to gangster bloodlet
ting; he turned it into art.
With Argentos first effort, The Bird with 
the Crystal Plumage, he immediately be
came recognized as the Italian Hitchcock. 
European audiences became aware of a new 
talent in the classic giallo genre. Gialli are 
films based on Italian pulp mystery stories 
which are adorned with yellow covers, much 
as the French black covers symbolized noir 
in detective films. Characterized by complex 
story lines, eccentric characters, and long 
ambiguous titles (like Argentos follow-ups 
The Cat 0 Nine Tails, and Four Flies on 
Grey Velvet) these films are an Italian 
staple and the root of what has brought 
Argento his European fame.
Removed from the gialli, Suspiria and 
Inferno remain Argentos only forays into 
supernatural horror and the jump could not 
have been more welcome. Loosely based on 
Thomas De Quincys Levana and our La
dies of Sorrow, the films deal with the three 
mothers Mater Suspiriorum (The Mother of 
Sighs), Mater Lachrimarum (The Mother of
Tears), and Mater Tenebrarum (The Mother 
of Darkness). Each has control over fate, 
Suspiriorum with the spread of her secret 
and Lachrimarum with her clutch over trag
edy and pain. While Suspiria and In
ferno introduce the first two sorceresses in 
Germany and New York, Tenebrarums 
completion of the film trilogy in Rome has 
yet to be made.
Argentos horror movies are all about style. 
The highlights of the movies are not the plot 
twists but the gruesome expressionistic set 
pieces like the secret flooded hotel basement 
in Inferno or the chicken-wire death trap in 
Suspiria. To gore fans, the double murder at 
the beginning of Suspiria is as majestic as 
the opening shower scene in Psycho.
Argento manages to create deeply haunt
ing atmospheres almost effortlessly, as if 
using broad brush strokes. His horror films 
are considered seminal. In fact, some of the 
most memorable work of directors like the 
Coen Brothers, Cronenberg, and even Lynch, 
can be traced to an Argento set piece or 
concept. The living hellish hotel from Barton 
Fink and the post-modern nightmare house 
in Lost Highway are born from the damned
building in Inferno, an architectural conun
drum of floating carcasses and walls through 
which death can hear.
Many popular post-modern film techniques 
were pioneered by Argento. In Suspiria, he 
used an old Technicolor film stock with three 
color bands and painted the sets in the same 
primary colors to create a menacing chromatic 
dimension to the coven of ballet instructors. 
Sound design is also important to Argento (an 
interest he shares with Lynch), and the loud artrock music and the fleeting sound-effect voices 
are a much imitated trademark of his movies.
Other Argento highlights include his fre
quent work with Pittsburghs George Romero, 
producing Dawn of the Dead and directing 
the second installment of Two Evil Eyes. His 
current feature, The Stendhal Syndrome 
continues Argentos work in the giallo and has 
even been called by some to be the closest 
thing Italy has ever produced to a hard-boiled 
noir film.
Suspiria and Inferno will be playing on 
April 13th in McConomy Auditorium. 
Some of Argentos movies are also avail
able on video.

Letters to Cleo will play on Saturday afternoon during Carnival.
Carnival performers entertain

By ENA KHAN
Tartan News Editor
This year, Carnival has a slew 
of exciting acts that are bound to 
make you stay glued to your TV 
set. From ventriloquists to up and 
coming bands, the lineup has 
something for everyone.
The festivities begin Thursday 
afternoon when the Bagpipers 
and Kiltie band toot their horns 
dining the opening ceremonies.
Mark Moran, a New Jersey 
native, will be performing his co
medic routine on Saturday night. 
Moran has appeared at An 
evening at the Improv, Comedy
Ken Namkung/Tartan Art Staff
on the Road, and the Rascals 
Comedy Hour. He first per
formed at CMU during Home
coming this year and has been 
asked to return because of the 
large turnout at his last show. 
There were a lot of people. Id 
guess 300-400. He was really 
well-received. The crowd loved 
him, said Brian Leet, a fourthyear architecture student and the 
Carnival publicity chair. I really 
enjoyed him at homecoming, said 
Amy Ondos, a junior chemical en
gineering major and the Carnival 
entertainment chair.
Comedian Jonathan Brandt will 
be performing Thursday night in

the SDC tent. Brandt grew up in 
the suburbs of New Jersey and 
developed a smart, fast-paced, 
twisted sense of humor. Also on 
Thursday night, Mark 
Pittman will be hypno
tizing the audience 
in the SDC tent.
Pittman demon

how much 
control the 
mind has 
over the 
body by 
putting 
audience 
members 
into a deep 
sleep and 
making 
them do hi

embarrass
ing things.
Ventrilo
quist Dan Horn 
will appear in the SDC tent on
Saturday night following Moran. 
Horn has spent seven years writ
ing and performing comedy on 
television and has toured nation
ally. He has appeared on shows; 
such as Comic Strip Live, VH1 Stand-up Spotlight, and

There are three absolutes about Spring Carnival: 
CompuBookie will be wrong, Sig Nu will use the same damn 
booth again, and everyone will bitch about the bands. Granted, 
last year we scored the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and had 1,400 
skanking on the Cut, but I somehow think that Letters to Cleo 
will end up in the also-ran bin with Belly and Yo La Tengo....
This is not to say Letters to Cleo are bad, but the Carnival 
Commitee mustve been up in arms over the fact that the 
entertainment overshadowed Buggy last year to have picked a 
band which virtually dropped out of sight after a radio hit a few 
years back.
Continuing our fascination with Boston bands, Letters to 
Cleo are nice, noisy pop with a girl singer: Kinda like a jangly 
Weezer with Gwen Stefani on vocals  so Gen X it hurts. 
Theyre what mainstream radio figures is to college music. 
Together for a good six years now with/two releases on Giant 
and Cherry Disc records (1993s funky folk-pop Aurora Gory 
Alice, and 1995s harder-edged Wholesale Meats and Fish), 
Letters to Cleo make no pretentions about being anything more 
indie than a happy loser pop band, in the words of singer Kay 
Hanley.
Ill admit that at first I wasnt exactly thrilled with the choice 
of them for the Carnival spot, however after taking a crash 
course via the web, the band is precisely what you should want 
on Saturday afternoon  a loud, happy, sometimes sappy rock 
band to dance away your cares in anticipation of the final 
nights activities.
Fueled by a growly dual guitar attack, their slower songs 
tend to take a back seat to rave-ups like Demon Rock and the 
infectiously pop-punky You Dirty Rat. You probably heard of 
them due to the radio saturation Here & Now received being 
the spotlight song of the Melrose Place soundtrack a few 
years back, as well as covering The Cars Dangerous Type on 
The Craft soundtrack last year. Dont dismiss these self
described wussies as lightweights because of their track 
record  they rock much harder live, as evidenced by their 
performances on Late Night with Conan OBrien. Oh hell, I 
give em my seal of approval....
Supporting Letters to Cleo on Saturday will be fellow 
Bostonians Angry Salad. Theyre a bit of an enigma, with 
comparisons ranging from The Cures poppier moments to the 
Kingston Trio. Another pop-rock band, Angry Salad suppos
edly was born in 1991 at Brown University and have been 
touring since around 1993. After selling nearly 6,000 copies of 
their debut CD, The Guinea PigEP, at shows across the nation, 
1997 sees the release of their 10-song Bizarre Gardening 
Accident CD, featuring a cover of 99 Red Balloons.
You cant fault them for gaining a good underground buzz all 
by themselves with non-stop touring, because its paid off in 
many ways  particularly by scoring them some rather choice 
spots opening for Live, Violent Femmes, and Goo Goo Dolls. 
Actually, Live kicked them off the tour after just one show at 
Penn State. Angry Salad are already cool in my book just for 
that alone. That and their logo being a bowl of tossed greens 
flipping you the bird:
Dont let preconceived opinions of these bands hold you back 
from having a good time. Saturday is a free show on the big 
grassy thing between the buildings that does not require 
transportation fees. So yea, go eat, drink, and beat larry, just 
dont forget your lollipops.

Liar Liar contains zaniness, lacks plot
By SCOTT SHELL
Tartan Staffwriter
I remember early Saturday mornings 
when my sister and I hurried out of bed 
and plopped in front of the television. It 
was time for The Smurfs. We spent what 
seemed hours watching that show, and 
even longer watching the ones that fol
lowed. Ritually, and like all of our friends, 
we slipped into our own world  one of 
melodrama and cheesy plots, silliness, 
and simple entertainment.
What: Liar Liar 
Director: Tom Shadyac 
I Company: Universal Pictures
Enter the domain of Jim Carrey. The 
In Living Color veteran is now starring 
in Liar Liar, a comedy that mixes much 
of the Saturday morning genre with the 
adult world. Directing is Tom Shadyac, 
also director of the original Ace Ventura. 
Unfortunately, Liar Liar lacks the co
herence of its predecessor. The CarreyShadyac team manages an entertaining 
farce but doesnt translate the cartoon 
style well.
.The story tells of Fletcher Reed, an 
aggressive lawyer with a habit for 
stretching the truth for his and his cli
ents benefit. Recently divorced and vy
ing for partnership at his firm, he finds 
little time to spend with his son, Max. 
And after Fletcher misses Maxs fifth 
birthday, the boy makes a wish that his 
father would not lie for a day. Much to 
Fletchers liability and the audiences 
amusement, this wish is granted.
For the most part, the no-lying gag is
played off well and receives a good bit of 
laughter. But there is, disappointingly, 
little more to the plot th^n that. The 
movie runs less than an hour and a half, 
and even so, it often stretches its single 
motif a little thin.
Ace Ventura had a simplistic plot as 
well, but Carrey side-tracked it con
stantly, refreshing it with humor in the 
process. Liar Liar doesnt do this; its 
more of an expansion of a short, one
sided Saturday morning show, rather 
than a translation and enhancement.
Fortunately, though, this is no Cable 
Guy. Carreys character is not annoying, 
and he is generally very likable. Theres 
still that Carrey 
presence with goofy 
faces and ridiculous 
stunts, but it is 
slightly more ma
ture as the come
dian tempers it for 
more emotional 
scenes.
His craziness 
could even be tem
pered more. I felt 
Robin Williams 
might have been 
better, not because 
of comedic talent, 
but because he so 
well strikes a con
trast between seri
ous and outra
geous. Liar Liar, 
with a good bit of 
sexual innuendo, is 
clearly adult-oriented; yet Carreys
continuous silliness makes it seem child
ish. Co-star Swoosie Kurtz says it all in 
one of the blooper shots during the cred
its when she jokingly objects, 
Overactor!
I was a devout fan of In Living Color, 
and I loved Ace Ventura, but Liar Liar 
doesnt capture the same humor. Its plot 
is a little misplaced and confused  
while mixing elements from both, it 
doesnt really belong on film or Saturday 
morning shows. The film yields a good 
number of chuckles and is on the whole 
entertaining, but it is probably worth 
waiting for video rental or the less-expensive second-hand movie theaters.

Jedi returns with surprisesObjects add color 
to Hewlett Gallery
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
In 1983, the soundtrack to Return of 
the Jedi, the third movie in the Star 
Wars Trilogy, was released five days 
before the theatrical release. Presented 
as a single LP, the Academy AwardNominated music by John Williams was 
sparse  only about 20 percent of the 
score was available to the public. In 
1993, a four-CD Box Set containing music 
from all three films was released, and it 
included more music from Jedi. But there 
were still many sought-after musical 
cues not released  until now.
What: The Return of the Jedi Special Edition Original Motion Picture Soundtrack 
Company: RCA Victor
Last month, RCA Victor and Lucasfilm 
Ltd. released the third soundtrack to the 
Star Wars Trilogy Special Editions. A 
two-CD set, the score to Jedi is finally 
available in its entirety  almost. 
With over two-and-a-half hours of mu
sic, this is by far the most extensive 
release of the music to Jedi ever.
But it is still not complete. The 
song Lapti Nek, which was per
formed in Jabbas Palace, is gone. In 
its place, we have Jedi Rocks, a new 
song which seems to be a very alien 
version of a Blues Brothers tune.
Another song missing (for better or 
for worse) is the Ewok Celebration 
song at the end of the movie, just 
before the end credits. In its place is 
the first new Star Wars music that 
John Wilhams has written in 13 years. 
Victory Celebration is its replace
ment, and in my opinion is far supe
rior  albeit different  to Ewok 
Celebration.
The reason for all this new music is 
because George Lucas, in his efforts 
to enhance the Star Wars Trilogy, 
has added new sequences both in 
Jabbas Palace and at the end of the
As extra bonuses, we get some music 
not even used in the film: Tatooine 
Rendezvous occurs at the beginning of 
the film when Luke builds a new 
lightsaber in Obi-Wans house before 
sending R2-D2 and C3-P0 to Jabbas. 
Filmed, but cut from the film, the music 
underscores a conversation that Luke 
and Vader have through the Force. An 
alternate version of Sail Barge Assault 
is also presented  this takes place 
during Lukes attack and escape from 
Jabbas Sail Barge. Because it was more 
of an action cue than theme music, it 
was discarded, and replaced with the 
version currently in the film (which has 
all the themes present).
As a whole, most of the sound on the 
CD is excellent. Re-mastered this past 
year, finally everything is as clear as 
it always should have been. Some of 
the music was degraded, sadly, and 
sometimes the quality is not the best 
it should have been. But because it 
was not available to us before, it is 
good to hear in almost 
any condition. But much of 
the music is background 
music  it makes more 
sense in the context of 
watching the films than 
just listening to the music 
in your room. In that re
gard, Jedi is my least fa
vorite Star Wars 
soundtrack, although there 
are bits of it which I enjoy 
more than some parts of 
the other two scores.
If you already have the 
two releases from earlier 
this year, for Star Wars 
and The Empire Strikes 
Back, it would be worth 
it to get Return of the 
Jedi andhave a complete 
set. But if you only have 
a passing interest, and 
dont own the other two, 
courtesy of RCA yOU might want to pass 
this one over.
movie. The song in Jabbas Palace is now 
more of a musical production than it was 
before, and the ending sequence now 
shows victory celebrations on Endor, 
Tatooine, Bespin, and Coruscant (the 
Imperial Homeworld). The music is a 
tribal rhythm, with a new theme heard 
in flutes, then childrens voices, then a 
full chorus climaxing into the End 
Titles. As a musical piece, Victory Cel
ebration is a nice bit of work.
Given that they removed some music, 
some might wonder what they added. 
There is no exact number of minutes to 
reference, but by going over the times of 
the tracks, there is at least one hour of 
music that was not available before, 
including source music for Jabbas Pal
ace and the Ewok Village. Finally avail
able to us is the music used on Tatooine 
when C3-PO and R2-D2 are captured 
at Jabbas, Speeder Bike Chase, 
Overtaking the Bunker, and Super
structure Chase, from the final battle 
at the end of the film.
The new Jedi soundtrack contains new tracks.

Imagine that the walls, fixtures, 
and spaces of the buildings on campus 
could talk. What would the conversa
tions be like? Would there be, be
tween two objects, the tired sound of 
two old women exchanging stories of 
illness and malady, or the predictable 
exponentiation of two fishers trying 
to outdo each others tales about the 
one that got away?
Or perhaps one would hear some
thing more dynamic and less expected 
like the dialogue between the Hewlett 
Gallery space and Color Objects, an 
installation by Iso Wagner, a resident 
artist in the CFA from. Germany. The 
conversation that Wagner initiates 
with her work quells the attempts of 
the Hewlett space to define its age 
and patriarchy with a declaration of 
I am red. I am big. I am exact and I 
am NEW!
The work combines intense color, 
exact lines, geometry, and enormous 
size to pull the viewer into the Hewlett 
space and question the gallerys di
mensions and atmosphere.
In the foyer, a small red square, 
centered on the wall, faces an equally 
centered triangle. Through the arch
way to the gallery the points of tri
angles that seem to be sliding off the 
wall beckon one into the redefined 
space.
Geometric shapes formed from uni
form red bands dominate the walls 
and dwarf the viewer. The exactness 
and stability of the lines contradict 
the lopsided positioning of the shapes 
and guide the eye. To the left, the 
corner of a square reaches above the 
ornate baseboards of the room and up 
into infinity.
Down from this peak, another cor
ner of the square leads to the center of 
the triangle sliding down the back 
wall. From the line bisecting the rear 
triangles mass, the eye travels up
wards along the lines of the bands and 
then back down along the right edge
of the triangle which points at eye 
level to another large triangle on the 
right wall.
This triangle seems to elongate the 
room as it drags the eye from a point ' 
near the floor to a point near the 
upper baseboards of the wall and then 
down horizontally until the lines bend 
across the floor reaching for the feet of 
the viewer. The result of this is not the 
static relationship of a viewer before a 
painting hanging flatly and horizon
tally on the wall, but instead it is 
dynamic, a moving relationship, where 
the turning viewer finds himself at 
one moment dwarfed by the dimen
sions of the work and the next watch
ing it taper away at his feet.
More significant than the motion of 
this installation is its intense red color. 
Wagner says of her work, I like to 
create spaces where color occurs, 
places in which one encounters color 
in a new way, in an unusual context in 
order to experience this color in a very 
immediate manner freed of symbols, 
associations, definitions, and habits 
of seeing,  and this is exactly what 
she does in the Hewlett Gallery.
The color cannot be described as fire 
engine red, or apple red, or brick red. 
It is the red from which it seems every 
other red thing in the world must 
have originated. Its intensity and sen
suality is almost seductive. One steps  
closer trying to get into the red and 
feel what it really is.
One steps back to take in the en
tirety of the shapes and there it is the 
same red, reaching all around and 
above, defying attempts to ball it up 
into a static, contained element.The 
strength and brilliance of the color 
are such that it almost seems burned 
onto the eye, even tinging the white 
walls and polished wooden floors green
 anything but red.
Color Objects offers a refreshing sim
plicity and intensity. Nothing has to 
be read into it or deciphered from it. It 
just is, big and red.
Color Objects runs through April 25 
at the Hewlett Gallery.

Ill be ordering a lot of food then but

diocre Marvel vs. DC miniseries by 
the almost-never-mediocre Peter 
David and the mediocre-is-my-middlename Ron Marz, the first round of 
Amalgam titles was surprisingly good. 
But more importantly, they sold well, 
so DC and Marvel produced a series of 
follow-ups.
The good news is, the creative teams 
were better than I expected: instead 
of getting untested talent on new 
characters, we get writers Karl 
Kesel, Roger Stern, Christopher 
Priest, Mark Waid, Alan Grant, Kurt 
Busiek, and Keith Giffen, and art
ists John Romita Jr., Oscar Jiminez, 
Dave Gibbons, and Rick Burchett.
The bad news is that the execu
tion is, well, mediocre. Many of the 
titles strive to retell some famous 
moments in comics history (the Fan
tastic Four vs. Galactus, or the cre
ation of the New Gods), but instead 
offer a pale imitation. The dialogue 
is often snappy, but most of the

fan.
And now, my spoiler-free reviews:
Generation Hex: Didnt buy it.
Magnetic Men featuring Magneto: 
Didnt buy it.
The Exciting X-Patrol: Didnt buy it.
Bat-Thing: Didnt buy it.
Super-Soldier: Man of War: Despite 
Waid, didnt buy it.
Lobo the Duck: Wish I hadnt bought 
it. Grants dialogue is fun, and you have 
to love the premise of a cigar-smoking 
homicidal duck. But the plot is nonexist
ent. Amusing, a little fun, but not worth 
two bucks.
Thorion oftheNewAsgods: Giffen and 
Romita do a passable Kirby riff, with 
plenty of splash panels and 
a lot of cosmic doodads. But 
there isnt enough charac
terization to make me care 
about these characters Ive 
never seen before and wont 
see again. I wanted more 
from the combinations of two 
gods (Orion and Thor, Loki 
and Desaad, Thanos and 
Darkseid).
Challengers of the Fan
tastic: Blah. Big cosmic 
event, but it feels so pedes
trian, I couldnt get into it.
The Amalgamation of the 
Fantastic Four and the 
Challengers is fun, though.
Amusing, but it could have 
been so much better.

The Amalgam series is mediocre.
Spider-Boy Team-Up: This is not an 
Amalgamation. This is an entire book 
making fun of the Legion of Superhe
roes. So unless you really know Legion 
history, this book will give you a head
ache. Spider-Boy was one of the most 
fun creations from the first round of 
Amalgam, but here hes nothing but 
an observer.
JLX Unleashed: Jiminez provides 
the best art of the books I read, with
managed to do that), so unless youre 
a Priest fan, this book will give you a 
headache.
Dark Claw Adventures: Neat con
cept, usingBatman Adventures- style 
art for the story of Batman and Wol
verine combined into a tortured soul 
with a smart mouth. The best plot of 
any of them, featuring the return of 
Lady Thalia. Its a Batman story more 
than a Wolverine story, so Wolverine 
fans beware: he doesnt actually kill 
anybody.
Iron Lantern: This book will not 
give you a headache. This is what the 
entire Amalgam run should have been: 
the characters are understandable 
even if you dont know who theyre 
Amalgamated 
with, the art is 
crisp, and the 
story is pleas
antly cosmic 
and moving. 
This was the 
only story that I 
wanted to see 
another issue of, 
because its the 
only one that 
had any direc
tion. And kudos 
to Busiek for all 
the subtle digs 
against my least 
favorite charac
ter in comics, 
Kyle Rayner.
Overall, the entire series gets a 
B-. If you know somebody stupid 
enough to have bought these, bor

CD shows emotions
more air-time than it has been getting. 
One song, aptly titled Song for the 
Dumped, stands out for me, though. 
This song, while happy in time, expresses 
many of the same angry, albeit ridicu
lous thoughts, every guy has had at least 
once in the same situation, although in 
a humorous fashion. Sorry girls, you 
wont be able to relate to this one, only 
sympathize. This striking contrast be
tween upbeat music and biting lyrics is 
something Ben Folds Five have carried 
over from their previous work.

The adage goes, if it isnt broken,

anyway. They remain true to the original

the band, there has been little one more from Pop, the hook-laden 
new music to listen to besides 
movie soundtracks. Batman For

sible ... Im sure that Im not the 
only fan who wondered if U2 
was ever going to get around to 
making another album.
Who: U2 
jKj What: Pop
Company: Island Record
For those who have thought 
the same thing, wonder no 
longer. U2s new record, Pop, is 
finally here.
For those who hated Zooropa, 
Im sorry. This isnt 
the U2 that you lis
tened to when you 
were a kid, or at least 
not completely. From 
Boy to Achtung Baby, 
the band has under
gone major changes, 
reinventing them
selves at every turn.
Since their last album,
U2 has apparently ex
perimented with and 
incorporated more 
techno-like beats and 
grooves into Pop, as 
can be heard on fasttempo songs such as 
Mofo or Disco
theque. Yeah, I know 
... I thought the same 
thing when I heard 
about it. Techno and 
rock fusion? Impos
sible! U2 has managed 
to accomplish this 
rather daunting task, 
however, and the re
sults are much better 
than I initially ex
pected.
You may already 
have heard the first 
new single, DiscoStaring at the Sun. This song 
has an incredibly catchy chorus 
that will stick in your head for 
days after listening to it, and is 
something of a return to rock from 
more techno-ish tracks.
It is this coexistence of rock and 
techno on this album, sometimes 
on the same song, that is so in
triguing. Though the two genres 
may appear to be almost mutu
ally exclusive, U2 blends both 
with considerable skill, fusing 
them into a seamless whole. This 
can be seen on Do You Feel 
Loved, which almost seems to 
alternate between rock and 
techno for the chorus and stan
zas, respectively. Of course, there 
are also songs that seem to be 
predominantly one or the other, 
such as Miami or Wake Up 
Dead Man.
There are few problems with 
Pop, besides the occasional poor 
song. Perhaps the worst fault is 
U2s habit of loading their al
bums with strong songs in the 
first half of the album, and plac
ing the weaker in the second half. 
Of course, this is not a phenom
enon specific to Pop, and if youve 
lived with it this long, then it is a 
familiar enough experience. In 
the end, the quality of the songs 
is all that really matters. Im 
happy to say that the songs on 
Pop are good, very good. Just dif
ferent. Ifyou hated Zooropa, stay 
away. If youre a longtime U2 
fan, youll like this album. If 
youve never heard of 1^2 be
fore, check it out.
U2 continues to delight fans with their latest release, Pop.

Rashomon
Akira Kurosawa is the man. He directs, he 
writes, he even edits. And he presents you with 
four different accounts of a rape and murder in 
ancient Japan. Which story is true? Who cares?
Deliciously black-and-white, this 1950 Japa
nese film is the epitome of subjective objectivity, 
whatever that means. Its like a Choose-YourOwn-Adventure. No, its more like being on a 
jury. Well, actually its kinda like playing Truth 
or Dare with a schizophrenic. Anyway, its a 
classic.

Ive never seen one of these flicks. There were 
like four of them with the word Last in the title, 
but they just kept making em. Now that theyve 
used the word First, does that mean theyll 
stop? The only good title was Star Trek II: The 
Wrath of Khan. I think all sequels should be 
called The Wrath of Khan. I dont know who Khan 
is, but he sounds tough. I think hes the guy who 
makes little bugs crawl in your ear and bite your

Suspiria & Inferno
Are you ready for an Italian double feature 
fright night? Director Dario Argento presents 
two chilling tales of murder and mayhem. The 
posters claim that the only thing scarier than the 
last 12 minutes of Suspiria is the first 90. But I 
say the only thing scarier is Inferno, the 107 
minutes which come after it. Take the Pepsi 
challenge and find out for yourself.

Bad writing curses The Saint
Musician blends styles in new CD
By AMY BERGER
Tartan Staffwriter
The title of the first track of Blue, the 
latest release from singer/songwriter Rob
ert Mainwaring, describes most of the al
bum  Countryesque. Mainwaring com
bines his Georgia roots with the rock style of 
New York, his current residence, in songs 
that are melodic and relaxing, but some
what monotonous.
 Who: Robert Mainwaring \ What: Blue
Company: Later and Tal Recordings
The blending of acoustic and electric gui
tars, bass, and percussion with the tone of 
Mainwarings voice has clear hints of coun
try music, but its semi-fast tempo gives it 
the feel of rock.
Country flair is easy to recognize in 
Walls and Waves. The electric guitar 
solos by Rowan Bishop in this song are 
soulful and the way he bends many of the 
notes gives it a country sound. The acous
tic background and pulse of the percus
sion are a great accompaniment to the 
creative solos.
Reminiscent of a country ballad, the 
song Caroline is slower than the other 
tunes on the album. Simon Archambault 
plays some great bass licks that, when 
combined with the drum playing of Mark 
Brotter, add just a little taste of funk to 
Caroline.
The song Half of the Time is also rather 
calm, but what makes it interesting and
different from Caroline is its modern Celtic 
sound. Bishops guitar line sounds like some
thing that would be played on Irish tin flutes 
or bagpipes, and the rhythm can even be 
interpreted as a slow jig.
Dont get the wrong idea  the music has 
an undeniable country influence, but these 
songs arent the typical my wife left me and 
all I have left is this dirty old pickup truck 
type of country tunes. The bass and percus
sion make the music just as much rock as it is 
country. Mainwarings songs are not ones 
youd nearly break your arm reaching for 
the radio to shut off.
The music takes a slight departure from 
country roots in the songs Looking for a 
Light and Faith and Fire. Both of these are 
a little faster than the others, and have a 
much greater electric guitar presence. They 
sound like grunge, and Mainwarings angrysounding vocals on Faith and Fire are very 
different from the calm ones heard on 
Caroline. This song starts with a drum 
intro that sets the listener up for funk, but as 
it continues, funk quickly gives way to rock 
and even leads to a heavy-metal sounding 
guitar solo.
The biggest problem with Mainwarings 
Blue is monotony in both the music and the 
lyrics. Although his voice is soothing and 
at times, powerful, it is very limited. 
Judging from his performance on this 
album, his vocal range is small. Also, 
most of the notes and rhythms in the 
background remain the. same through 
entire songs.
After a few minutes, the combination 
of these factors make some songs sound

Robert Mainwarings new release fuses country

more like lullabies than contemporary 
rock.
Aside from the possibility of boredom by 
the end of some songs, the music is catchy 
and creative. The range from country to 
grunge to Celtic shows that Robert 
Mainwaring and his musicians have many 
musical influences and can play weir in 
different styles;
