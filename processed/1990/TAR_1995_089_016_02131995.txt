The executive actions of Student Gov
ernment President Declan McCullagh 
were again scrutinized at the February 
7 meeting of Student Senate. The meet
ing introduced a 10 page financial report 
on the activity of his account, a petition 
for impeachment signed by nearly 350 
students, and questions concerning his 
enrollment status.
Sources close to Student Senate have 
informed the Tartan that the Senate 
may make a motion to reconsider the 
impeachment of the president, if the 
petition does not collect 500 signatures. 
Senators said they did not have enough 
knowledge of McCullaghs affairs to be
gin the impeachment process - one that 
would take several weeks to complete.
The Administration is aware of the 
situation. Senate Advisor, Kevin 
-Hughes, and Associate Dean of Student 
Affairs, Anne Shields, attend each meet
ing. However, Burt Holzman, Chair of 
Student Senate, said they are staying 
out and leaving students to decide. Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy said, 
outside of an advisory capacity, deci
sions about who students want to have 
serve for them ... is at the discretion of 
the student body,... [biit] it would not be 
an administrative decision whether 
someone should represent that constitu
ency. Murphy also said that histori
cally, the administration has not stepped 
in and directed a student organization 
to take a certain action.
At Tuesdays meeting, Emma Gosden, 
the Student Government Treasurer, pre
sented each senator with a copy of a 
report detailing the activity of 
McCullaghs presidential account. 
Gosden hoped the report would stimu
late discussion concerning questions 
raised at Senates January 24th meet
ing.
Gosden is not a voting member of Sen
ate, but after distributing her report she 
said, I think its up to the student body 
to tell their senators how they feel.
The first eight issues in Gosdens re
port address these questions. McCullagh 
obtained an American Express Corpo
rate Card without Carnegie Mellons 
authorization. McCullagh used the card 
for various items, including dinners 
where alcohol was served. American 
Express canceled the card on November 
19, 1994, leaving an outstanding bal
ance of $371.82. Gosden contacted 
American Express to inquire as to who
was liable for the accounts balance  
CMU or McCullagh. After speaking with 
an account representative, who then 
checked with a supervisor, it was de
cided that CMU would not be held liable 
for the balance since it had not autho
rized the card.
Another significant item in the report 
is the fact that McCullagh made $50 in 
phone calls within a five-hour period. 
Between the hours of 9 am and 2:02 pm 
on December 6, the day after being ar
rested for domestic violence against 
Donna Riley, McCullagh made 44 phone 
calls with a total charge of $51.18. These 
calls were all billed to McCullaghs 
American Express Phone Card. 
McCullagh said at the February 7 Sen
ate meeting that all these calls were 
made from a pay phone and all but four 
involved Student Government business. 
However, sources close to Senate have 
said that these calls were not all campus 
related. McCullagh was in court at the 
time of these calls.
McCullaghs food expenditures also 
remain in question. As detailed in 
Gosdens report, McCullagh spent
cember of last semester on meals. As of 
February 12, McCullagh had yet to ex
plain five of them, totaling over $100, 
purchased on the American Express Cor
porate Card. One source said that 
McCullagh used the card to pay for his/ 
her dinner that included alcohol, while 
only a small part of the meeting per
tained to campus affairs.
The remaining issues concern use of 
the presidents discretionary fund  an 
account that is given to the President to 
be used for a variety of activities without 
being questioned.
McCullaghs enrollment status was 
also called into question at the last Sen
ate meeting. McCullagh said, I am a 
student at Carnegie Mellon. Sources 
have said that McCullagh had a 0.00 
QPA last semester. In addition, several 
sources have called the Registrars Of
fice to inquire about McCullaghs status 
and have been told that he was not 
enrolled.
Murphy said, the criteria applied to 
student leaders is applied by their indi
vidual organization ... To my knowl
edge, the only standard that Senate has

Drama Dept, receives new facility
By CONAL HO
''artan Junior Staffwriter
i Construction will begin on a 
performing arts center in the next 
jfew years. Paul Tellers, the Uni
versity Architect who is also the 
Project manager for the construc
tion of the performing arts cen
ter. said the plans for the center 
fegan at the end of 1994. The 
4nst optimistic completion date 
gU be the end of 1997, he said, 
however, this does not take into 
consideration potential problems 
during the construction, such as 
funding.
; The building will be located in 
fne area between Doherty Hall 
Jnd Warner Hall, across from the 
university Center.
^ This construction will define 
je Cut as a quadrangle like the 
Mall. The center will primarily 
e used by the Drama Depart
ment, although the Art Depart
ment will also have use of it.
DDF Associates, a three-part 
Joint venture, was selected re
cently to lay out a schematic plan 
for the center. DDF Associates 
consists of Michael Dennis and 
Associates, Damianos Brown 
Andrew, and John Fisher and 
Associates.
The construction of this center 
has been promised since the 
1930s. In the 1960s [the center] 
was designed for the Morewood 
parking lot area [but the idea 
didnt carry through], said Tell
ers.
There were also plans to build 
the center in the area between 
Donner Hall, Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie Hall, andResnik House. 
However, it was finally decided 
that the area between Doherty 
Hall and Warner Hall was the 
better place since it is more ac
cessible to the public. Tellers 
hopes that the center will attract 
city-wide audience.
Elisabeth Orion, head of the 
Carnegie Mellon Drama Depart
ment, said that the center is 
needed because the Drama De
partment is currently spread out
in three buildings: Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall, the Col
lege of Fine Arts, and the Studio 
Theater. Although she does not 
know how much space there will 
be in the center, she hopes that 
all the classrooms and offices will 
be located in one building.
As for any department, it is 
necessary to have the department 
consolidated and integrated. Ac
cording to Orion, this is more so 
for the Drama Department be
cause there is so much interac
tion going on [in the department]. 
Orion said that [In order to] 
maximize the efficiency of the 
building, the Drama Department 
is in close collaboration with the 
Architecture Department.
Some of the facilities that may 
be included in the center are a 
450-seat theater, television stu
dio, workshops for production and 
design, mixed media room and 
art gallery. Classrooms and of
fices will also be included in the 
center.

CMU earns FORE endowment
By GEL ALTEROVITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
A $1.5 million gift has been 
given to CMU by the founders 
of FORE Systems to set up an 
endowed professorship. FORE 
Systems, which markets cut
ting edge networking products, 
was founded in April 1990 by 
Eric Cooper, OnatMenzilcioglu, 
Francois Bitz, and Robert 
Sansom. All four of the co
founders were affiliated with 
the School of Computer Sci
ences at CMU in the past.
In a press release, President 
Mehrabian discussed the im
portance of the professorship 
to the university: This en
dowed professorship is... very 
important to our efforts to at
tract, recognize, and retain out
standing faculty.
Cooper, currently the CEO of 
FORE Systems, is a former pro
fessor from the School of Com
puter Science. He viewed the
founders decision to endow a pro
fessorship through the FORE 
Systems, Inc. Founders Fund as 
a way for us to complete the 
circle ... [and] give something 
back to the University.
Cooper explained that the rea
soning for an endowed professor
ship is to give Carnegie Mellon 
enough capital so that they can 
invest it. From the proceeds, the 
returns of that investment each 
year will be sufficient to pay the 
professors salary as well as pay 
some of the additional overhead 
that he or she needs to conduct 
his or her research.
In the press release, Mehrabian 
commented that, We are ex
tremely proud of FORE Systems 
rapid rise to industry leadership. 
It is one of the most dramatic 
spin-off success stories in the 
Universitys history and a good 
example of our contribution to 
our regional economy. 
According to Cooper, it is this 
success which has made this en
dowment possible: FORE 
went public in May of1994 and 
since then, the stock has ap
preciated in the market more 
than four times its initial price. 
The founders of FORE Systems 
are significant shareholders... 
[which] made us able to fund 
[the endowed professorship]. 
Since its founding, the com
pany has become a pioneer and 
leader in ATM (Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode) based network 
products.
ATM allows for better net
work performance by increas
ing bandwidth (network capac
ity) and speed.
The enhanced performance 
can lead to speeds as high as
2.5 Gbps (2.5 billion bits per

THIS JUST IN 
Bowlinn got atsnoi

WASHINGTON, February 10 (DJ)
 The troubled nomination of Heniy 
Foster as surgeon general ran into 
even more problems for President 
Clinton yesterday. At the same time, 
though, the nomination fight also is 
creating plenty of headaches for Re
publicans.
The Foster debate is bringing to the 
top ofthe national agenda a hot button 
issue that few lawmakers - and 
Repulicans in particular  care to 
confront: abortion. Moderate Republi
cans, who at first may have been in
clined to support someone like Foster, 
now run the risk of being bludgeoned 
by a key part of the partys base, Chris
tian conservatives.
More generally, the Foster nomina
tion is a distraction for the GOP. It has 
energized religious conservatives, who 
had been largely persuaded to stand 
silent on soda! issues during the first 
100 days of Congress and let the Re
publicans focus on their agenda of 
shrinking the government and cut
ting taxes. This gets us off-message, 
grumbled Sen. Connie Mack, a Florida 
Republican.
The uproar over Foster has even 
pushed the abortion issue into the 
realm of Republican presidential poli
tics. It arises just as former Vice Presi
dent Dan Quayle has decided to de
part from the race for the 1996 nomi
nation, freeing up the support of anti
abortion voters who favored him. It's 
probably not a coincidence that yes
terday, the day of Quayles exit, Phil 
Gramm, the senator from Texas and 
presidential aspirant, announced his 
clear opposition to Foster.
The nomination of a physician 
whose medical practice has included 
the routine performance of abortion to 
serve as Americas chief spokesman 
on public health is clearly inappropri
ate and divisive, Gramm asserted.
Of course, it still is Clinton, whose 
staff once again seems to have bungled 
a highly sensitive appointment, who 
has the most at stake. Yesterday, in 
the wake of Fosters disclosure on the 
ABC News program Nightline that 
he had performed 39 abortions - not 
fewer than a dozen as he had said in 
a statement the administration re
leased last week - White House offi
cials were hopeful that he had finally 
put to rest nagging questions about 
the details of his abortion record.
Speaking to reporters yesterday, 
Clinton pledged to stand by Foster. I
dont believe anything I have heard 
about him disqualifies him from serv
ing as surgeon general, the president 
said. He added that antiabortion ac
tivists were trying to define Foster, a 
Tennessee obstetrician and gynecolo
gist, in cardboard cut out terms. I 
think that is wrong. Meanwhile, a 
group of Democratic senators and sev
eral abortion-rights organizations 
rallied yesterday behind Foster.
But Republicans seemed to harden 
against the nomination. Senate Ma
jority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, a 
chief rival of Gramms for the GOP 
presidential nomination, said that if 
it gets any worse, they probably 
shouldnt send it up here. Mack said 
while his initial impressions ofthe 
nominee had been favorable, he now 
has serious questions about the in
tegrity and character of Dr. Foster.
Still, even among Republicans, the 
view is far from unanimous, under
scoring the divisiveness of the abor
tion issue. Republican Sen. Bob 
Packwood of Oregon said that it was 
outrageous that Foster was being 
attacked for performing a constitu
tionally protected procedure, adding 
that perhaps Clinton should appoint 
an orthopedist. Sen. Jim Jeffords, a 
Vermont Republican, said while he is 
reserving judgment about Foster, he 
is inclined to support him.
The Foster controversy makes clear 
that in the more than two decades 
since the Supreme Courts landmark 
Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abor
tion, the issue remains the political 
equivalent of a live grenade.
While some interest groups and cer
tain ideologically inclined politicians 
on both sides of the abortion issue 
relish the fight, most would rather 
avoid it. Theres no winning position 
on it, says political analyst Doug 
Bailey.
Thats especially true these days 
when some of those who oppose abor
tion worry about being associated with 
extremists who have shot and killed 
doctors at abortion clinics. And eyen 
among many people who are in favor 
of abortion rights, it remains an unde
sirable option. Indeed, Foster himself 
told Nightline that I abhor abor
tion... To me, abortion is failure.
Republicans have been hoping to 
find a way to keep the issue from 
driving a wedge into their party, whi ch 
has struggled with the question for 
years.
Terrorist leader gives guilty plea
NEW YORK, February 6 (DJ)  The 
alleged mastermind pleaded guilty in a 
plot to stage a war of urban terrorism by 
blowingup New York landmarks. Siddig 
Ibrahim Siddig Ali pleaded guilty this 
morning to all the counts against him, 
U.S. attorneys office spokesman Marvin 
Smilon said. He did not say whether 
prosecutors had made a deal with him in 
exchange for the plea.
Siddig Ali appeared in court before 
Judge Michael Mukasey at about 8 am 
and pleaded guilty to all the counts 
against him in the biggest terror trial in 
U.S. history.
John Jacobs, an attorney for another 
defendant, said Siddig Ah had signed a 
cooperation agreement and then read a 
statement implicating the other defen
dants.
Spokesman Marvin Smilon of the U.S. 
attorneys office would not confirm any 
deal.
Reporters were not present at the court 
appearance and court employees said 
later that the judge would not release 
the transcript until he had looked it 
over.
Siddig Ahs plea comes a week after 
testimony began in the trial of Sheik 
Omar Abdel-Rahman and 11 followers, 
including Siddig Ali, on charges they 
plotted a holy war against the United 
States.
Siddig Ali, 34, of Jersey City, N.J., was 
accused of conspiracy to wage a war of 
urban terrorism; solicitation and con
spiracy to murder Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak; the attempted bomb
ings; and shipping a firearm, using and 
carrying a firearm, and carrying de
structive devices for that bombing plot.
Until today, the governments case 
against the accused plotters rested 
heavily on the testimony of a former 
Egyptian army officer, Emad Salem, who 
infiltrated Abdel-Rahmans inner circle 
and secretly taped his conversations with 
the defendants.
In transcripts of tapes made by Salem, 
Siddig Ali is often the one describing 
how the plans are to be carried out. 
Prosecutors have called him a master
mind of the plot.
At opening statements, prosecutor 
Robert Khuzami said, This is a case 
about war ... The enemy is the United 
States, the battlefield the streets and 
tunnels of New York City.
In a single day, he said, the men wanted 
to blow up the United Nations, the FBI 
headquarters, the Lincoln and Holland 
tunnels and the George Washington 
Bridge. The tunnels and the bridge all 
connect New York and New Jersey.
The defendants were planning a day
of terror the likes of which the world has 
never seen, Khuzami said. They 
planned to slaughter people as they trav
eled between New York and New Jersey 
or sat in office buildings while there 
were ticking time bombs underground.
The defendants also allegedly plotted 
to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak and kidnap President Nixon 
and Henry Kissinger. They face life in 
prison if convicted.
Salem surprised prosecutors soon af
ter arrests were made 19 months ago 
when he revealed he had secretly re
corded his FBI handlers and had passed 
along information to the Egyptian gov
ernment.
The government paid Salem $1 mil
lion for his help - a figure that a prosecu
tor admitted in his opening statement 
that jurors might find to have been too 
high.Quayle will not run in 1996 race
WASHINGTON, February 9 (DJ)  
Former Vice President Dan Quayle has 
decided not to enter the 1996 presiden
tial race because of the difficulties rais
ing the money for a viable campaign, a 
senior adviser said today.
Quayle made the decision late last 
night and planned to issue a statement 
later today, said Mark Goodin, who had 
been helping Quayle prepare for the 
race.
Just last month, Quayle said he was a 
definitely running and planned to file 
candidacy papers by February 21. But 
in his travels and deliberations since, 
Quayle has found money hard to come 
by and got discouraged when confronted 
with what it would take to raise enough 
for a credible candidacy, Goodin said.
Quayles decision is yet another indi
cation that the GOP field will be far 
smaller than expected just a few months 
ago. In recent weeks, both former De
fense Secretary Dick Cheney and former 
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp have an
nounced they would not run.
That leaves a field of Senate Majority 
Leader Bob Dole, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm 
and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander. Others considering joining 
them include Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen 
Specter, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar 
and conservative commentator Patrick 
Buchanan. A few GOP governors also 
are mulling the race.
Earthquake kills 37 in Columbia

 Using hoses to pump oxygen through 
debris, rescuers worked through the 
night to reach survivors of a powerful 
earthquake thatkilledatleast37 people.
The earthquake had a preliminaiy 
magnitude of6.5 and was centered about 
175 miles west of Bogota, the Geophysj.

Hardest hit was the city of Pereir, 
where at least 25 people were killed anj 
135 injured, according to city officials

Rescuers used forklifts and backhoti

Clinton proposes strike legislation
WASHINGTON, February 8 (DJ)^ 
The Clinton administration proposed 
legislation to Congress that would cre
ate a three-member panel of indepen. 
dent arbitrators to settle the protracted 
baseball strike.
Moving just hours after House Speakei 
Newt Gingrich and another key GOP 
figure on Capitol Hill scoffed at 
congressional role.
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touted 
the administration-backed bill, which 
would do just that.
The bill, which was to be sponsored by 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, and Representative Pat Will
iams, D-Montana, would give Clinton 
authority to appoint a three-person panel 
of neutral arbitrators who would accept 
proposals and arguments from both sides 
and come up with a settlement.
No deadline would be imposed on the 
panel to come up with a plan, although 
the bill would specify that should be 
done as soon as possible.
And the bill contains no back-to-work 
order provision. It would merely em
power such a panel to dictate a settle
ment.
If we want a 1995 baseball season, 
this may be the last resort, Reich told 
reporters called to a downtown hotel 
that had been the site of days of fruitless 
talks between Major League Baseballs 
owners and players.

as we can to keep up ltla

Cooper described the existence of a 
partnership between FORE systems 
and Carnegie Mellon as mutually ben
eficial in that it works in a couple of
directions.CMU has been a continuing 
source of employees for FORE systems, 
since we recruit [CMU graduates]. ... 
And parts of Carnegie Mellon are also 
customers of FORE.

cuttingedge of technology and they have 
strong ties to CMU, so this endowment 
only solidifies their partnership.
Cooper also sees growth m the fu

Drama Department to acquire new facility
DRAMA, from page 1
Orion said that inadequate facilities 
are being used to teach certain technical 
courses such as the TV courses. These 
courses require special facilities which 
Carnegie Mellon currently does not have, 
and so are held in the WQED radio 
stations studio. With the new center, 
adequate facilities will be provided for 
the more technical intensive courses. An 
art gallery may be included in the cen
ter, which Tellers said is something that 
the Art Department needs.
Although there is a lack of space and 
adequate facility for the Drama Depart
ment, Orion does not think that this has
affected the strength of the drama pro
gram. She said that the strength of the 
department has come from having good 
faculty and students.
In terms of design, there is no set plan 
yet, although different ideas have been 
put in. One feature that Tellers men
tioned is that there will be a covered 
walkway similar to one being built for 
the University Center. Both of these 
walkways will accommodate the traffic 
in the east and west side of the campus. 
In general, the design will follow that of 
the original Hombostel heritage archi
tecture so that the campus will have a 
cohesive look.

50 Years Ago (2/13/45)The Tartan 
reported that One of the outstanding 
rushing parties these last two weeks 
was the Delta Tea Party Tuesday after
noon. The Delts made it their own get 
together party, so that the entering 
freshmen could meet some of the fresh
men girls. The Delt house was crowded 
from five to eight with students dancing, 
playing bridge, listening to piano boogie, 
or just talking.
25 years ago (2/13/70)  The Stu
dent Senate has reaffirmed its endorse
ment of the attempts on the part of 
Taylor-Allerdice High School students 
to ensure their rights to free speech, 
reported The Tartan In a motion passed 
several weeks ago, it was suggested that 
Joe Duckworth, president of Student 
Senate,. contact the presidents of the 
student bodies at other local universi
ties in order to draft a joint statement in 
support of the high school students. 
When Duckworth reported on Tuesday 
that his attempts to carry out the sug
gestion of the Senate had failed, a sec
ond motion was passed. The motion as
serted that the students of CMU sup
port in principle the rights of high school 
students to free speech and that at
tempts would be made to publicize this 
attitude in the public press.

Sunday morning when a fourth floor 
water fountain was discovered discon
nected from its water pipes.
Morewood resident Lori Brassaw said 
she was awakened at about 3 am by the 
sound of rushing water. She called Secu
rity when she saw the nearby fountain 
hanging halfway off the wall. It looked 
like a Three Stooges skit with the water 
gushing out. 
5 Years Ago (2/13/90)Some inter
esting renovations and relocations of 
existing Dining Service facilities may 
occur when the Kiltie Cafe establishes 
residence in the new dormitory next
year, reported The Tartan. According 
to Patrick Keating, Carnegie Mellons 
vice president for University Planning, 
there is a possibility that the Tartan 
Grill may leave its home in Skibos up
per level and move downstairs as part of 
a food court to be developed in space 
currently occupied by the Kiltie.
1 Year Ago (2/14/94),  The Tartan 
reported, Senior Megan Dietz, sopho
more Heather Arnett, and senior Kathy 
Jo Kramer, guests on Brock Hamlins 
WRCT talk show Jitney Talk, com
mented on the Lorena Bobbitt trial, never 
imagining that their opinions would 
spark a firestorm of criticism on a main
stream Pittsburgh radio station. The 
next day, February 2, a Jitney Talk 
listener called WRRK-FM morning 
drive-time DJ Jim Quinn. Quinn later 
called the women feministas in an in
terview published in last Sundays Pitts
burgh Post-Gazette.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  13 February 19955
pepper spray clears out dormitories
PEPPER, from page 1
colorless and smells like cayenne pep
per.
Those who come in contact with the 
mace typically suffer from nasal and 
throat burning, uncontrollable eye 
tearing, coughing, and nausea.
On Thursday night, there was a simi
lar incident in 
Scotland Yard. At 
about8:45, people 
in Scotland Yard 
began to cough.
The bartender,
Rick Zdan, a 
freshman politi
cal science/psy
chology major, 
was one of the 
first ones to no
tice. Basically, I 
started coughing, 
but I was just an
noyed by the feel
ing. Then one 
waiter said she 
felt a tickle in her throat, then the 
other one did. If everybody is feeling it, 
somethings wrong. So I went and got 
the manager, and said The rest of the 
staff is complaining and everybody in 
the place started coughing. 
Sam Conley, the manager on duty 
for Scotland Yard and Corner Oven, 
said The first thing I smelled was a 
cigarette, then I felt it hit me in the 
back of the throat. I walked towards 
the front cash register, walked outside 
to get a breath of fresh air, then walked
back in and immediately called secu
rity.
Martin White, the officer who re
sponded, said I cant smell [anything], 
but theres always a chance - Im not 
making any speculation.
At this time, we dont know exactly 
what it is.
He added, We train with [pepper 
spray] and its definitely a controlled 
environment. You dont just spray this 
stuff around. I mean, anything that 
could affect somebodys health is a big 
deal. If we catch them, it will be a big 
deal.
Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia pointed out that it has not 
been confirmed that pepper gas is in 
fact what was sprayed. Its our best 
guess so far, he stated.
He also said that he was unsure
that the Scotland Yard incident was 
related to the four other possible 
sprayings.
LaPaglia believes that because 
there have been other incidents, people 
will be likely to blame pepper gas 
every time some people start cough
ing.
During Fall Orien
tation, pepper gas was 
sold on campus, and it 
was recommended as 
a safety precaution in 
a program for fresh
men.
LaPaglia does not 
believe that the uni
versity will stop doing 
this as a result of the 
recent problems. We 
cant label any prod
uct as bad,  he stated.
The memos from 
Foster stated Obvi
ously, this is an ex
tremely serious situa
tion. ... I would like all of us in our 
residential community to join together 
and help insure that these occurrences 
come to an end.
Be particularly vigilant, and if you 
have any information about these in
cidents, I encourage you to contact 
Campus Police or me directly so that 
swift remedial action can be taken. 
Regarding how much information 
is available, LaPaglia said, Were lim
ited in what we know ... we hope 
someone can give us some info.
[Pepper mace] is colorless and smells 
like cayenne pepper. Those who come in 
contact ... suffer from nasal and throat 
burning, uncontrollable eye tearing, 
coughing and nausea. 
 Tim Foster, 
Director of Residence Life

MCCULLAGH, from page 1
applied is that someone must be en
rolled as a student.
To be fully enrolled at CMU, students 
must be registered for classes and finan
cially cleared. Students are first given 
until the 10th day of classes to complete 
enrollment or they are administratively 
withdrawn.
If they have registered for classes but 
are not cleared by the Cashiers Office, 
they are warned by the Registrar, and
then given until the 15th day of classes, 
or February 3 of this year, to be cleared. 
If they do not complete enrollment, they 
are administratively withdrawn.
McCullagh declined comment but did 
produce a copy of the receipt dated Fri
day, February 10, showing that he had 
paid his Activities Fee. McCullagh also 
gave a copy to Senate.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University13 February 1995
N9Yni9 Nni9n wa9 
Cn wotn tnaxoialAn
Student Senate is an organiza
tion that is supposed to uphold stu
dent interests and rights on cam
pus. Constituents elect their repre
sentatives on the assumption that 
they will uphold their own best 
interests, as well as the schools. 
Unfortunately, in light of the re
cent events we have witnessed, we 
feel that Senate has breached their 
promise to the campus community, 
and must change both its attitude 
and actions in order to rectify the 
situation.
One of the most disturbing trends 
we see in Senate is its disregard for 
the student body. Judging from the 
behavior witnessed at the last Sen
ate meeting, there can be no doubt 
that Senate members are more con
cerned with following Roberts 
Rules of Order than with address
ing the student bodys needs.
During this meeting, the recent 
controversies surrounding Student 
Government President Declan 
McCullagh, and campus-wide re
actions to these incidents were dis
cussed briefly, and without ad
equate consideration. For example, 
an impeachment petition contain
ing the signatures of nearly 350 
students was presented to Senate. 
While were well aware that such 
petitions are legally of no conse
quence unless they contain at least 
500 names, it is perhaps signifi
cant that only 326 votes put 
McCullagh in office. We were dis
turbed to see they disregarded its 
significance.
Were sad to see that senators 
seem more concerned with boost
ing their r6sum6s than addressing 
thestudentbodys sentiments. Sen
ate Chair Burt Holzman said as 
much when he told Senators not to 
give in to undue pressure from 
their constituents. But isnt it the 
senators responsibility to listen to 
the people theyre supposed to rep
resent? Isnt their job to respond to 
the needs of the public? The very 
fact that constituents are complaining so loudly should indicate what 
they think about the issues at hand 
and Senates response to them.
The apathetic attitudes and in
effective actions of Senate are, per
haps, most noticeable at their 
meetings. Senators seem pro
foundly disinterested and unaware 
during these meetingsthey talk 
amongst themselves and hardly 
look up to hear others speak. Sena
tors have admitted that they have 
ended debate on issues before they 
understood the facts they were 
discussing. They seem bored when 
issues of importance to constitu
ents are raised, and are halfway 
out the door before meetings have 
ended.
This hurry-up-and-get-thisover-with attitude is reinforced 
by the fact that meetings are run 
on a ridiculously tight schedule  
sometimes only 10 minutes are 
allotted for discussion of crucial 
issues. We fear that if Abraham 
Lincoln appeared before Senate, 
he wouldnt be allowed to speak 
unless he had the good fortune to 
come at the audience participa
tion segment.
Finally, the cmu.student .gov
ernment bboard is a great forum 
between senators and students, 
yet senators now want to limit its 
access. We see no point in elimi
nating the little interaction that 
remains between these two groups. 
Limiting access would only serve 
to polarize the two groups further, 
thus further obstructing demo
cratic representation.
Senate must determine its pur
pose and place within the Univer
sity community. If its members 
wish to attain and retain a place of 
respect and equity at this school, 
they must conduct themselves in a 
manner more befitting to their of
fices.
This involves listening to the 
needs of their constituents, and 
then acting on them.

Keys stolen from a piano in Mudge

aged, signs tom down from Cyert 
Hall, toilets stolen from Margaret 
Morrison, ripped pages and bind
ings from Hunt Library, broken 
doors and elevators in Morewood 
Gardens, graffiti in countless ar
eas on campus.
Vandals are to blame for these 
acts and their list of misdeeds is 
extensive. No place, it seems, has 
been spared. On our campus, sense
less acts of destruction run ram
pant, from the traditional bathroom 
walls to expensive furniture.
Funny? Perhaps. Juvenile? 
Absolutely. Stress is often sug

How can dropping a toilet off the

rationale. There are numerous 
activities to get involved with on 
this campus. With a little effort 
and ingenuity, people should be 
able to come up with better things 
to do than ripping the hinges off 
doors.
The vandals are probably small 
in number and as a result, some 
students may have an it hasnt 
affected me attitude. That is sim
ply untrue. Vandalism benefits 
no one and undoubtedly hurts the 
campus community as a whole. 
Students cannot practice on pi
anos without keys, nor can they 
program when the mouseballs are 
stolen out of the computer clus
ters. Books are useless when some
one has tom important pages from 
them. This is a problem affecting 
everyone on campus. Whether we 
regard it as such or not, CMU, 
along with all ofits facilities, is our 
home. Accordingly, we should re
spect it as we would our own homes. 
Every student here has paid a sub
stantial amount of money for the 
privilege of coming here. When 
vandalism occurs, we, the stu
dents, are the ones who must pay 
for it. Unfortunately, it also dem
onstrates to visitors and outsiders 
that we are a community that just 
doesnt care. Lets demonstrate 
some pride in ourselves, our com
munity, and most importantly, our 
home by respecting our campus.
Letter to the Editor
when he desires a correct result. Per
haps the most blatant example is his 
refusal to release tapes and transcripts 
of UDC hearings, even for appeals. He 
refused to release tapes of the trial of Pat 
Mooney last spring and the Declan 
McCullagh trial on charges brought by 
Crystal Trexel. Murphys response to 
the appeal of the conviction of McCullagh 
on the charges brought by Donna Riley 
is only a prediction. But the promise in 
the student handbook that students 
may request tapes and transcripts of 
hearings seems deliberately calculated 
to mislead parties to the disciplinary 
process into thinking they have a chance 
at due process. A more pernicious ex
ample is that when Murphy desires a 
result consistent with politically-correct 
theory of who is the victim, Everett 
Tademy, University ombudsman and 
EEO/Afirmative Action officer, is ap
pointed to the UDC panel. Tademys 
bias in both the Mooney trial, and in the 
second trial of McCullagh, was explicit. 
In both cases, Tademy would interrupt 
arguments by the party designated 
ahead of time as the loser. In the case of 
McCullagh, he interrupted McCullaghs 
opening argument three times, assert
ing that what McCullagh was saying 
was irrelevant. Some of this irrel
evant information concerned Rileys 
history of bringing spurious allegations 
against those who disagree with her 
politics. A third example is that Murphy 
will apply the sentence from Trexels 
charges (heard first) to the sentence 
from the Riley charges. Thus the sen
tence in the first case will be used against 
McCullagh in the second, despite his not 
having been under sentence when the 
second alleged incident occurred. Even 
worse are Student Affairs attempts to 
stiffle any discussion of the UDC and to 
conceal the actions of the UDC behind a 
veil of silence. The victims of the UDC 
are warned that if they attempt to make 
a public case of the politics of the UDC, 
they will again be brought before the 
UDC. Perhaps Murphy thinks he can 
enforce congeniality at CMU through 
fear of his Star Chamber.

There are many logical reasons to be a

it would require a cruel God to create 
beings with the capacity to feel pain and 
desire to five but whose only purpose 
was to die so humans could consume 
their flesh. As Nobel Laureate Romain

shared his medical knowledge when he 
told parents that we shouldnt listen to

facts when he advocated free riding off 
the rest of society by not having your 
kids vaccinated. The truth of the matter 
is that children die from not receiving 
early childhood vaccinations. In Cali

who has lived a life dedicated to helping

Gang violence murders the innocent
Michelle Hall
Michelle Jensen never knew what hit 
her. One minute she was walking with 
some friends down a winding country 
road in rural Iowa, slightly drunk  the 
next minute she was dead. She was shot 
from behind by a gang member with a 
sawed-off shotgun. She was 17.
Jensen didnt live in a ghetto, and shed 
never had any trouble with the law. She 
was born and raised in Davenport, Iowa, 
a town of less than 100,000 residents and 
surrounded by farmland. She was a good 
student, interested in drama and art. If 
she made any mistake, it was becoming 
friendly with several guys known to run 
with an all-white Davenport gang, the 
Vice Lords. But the guys had always been 
respectful to her and polite to her parents. 
She thought they were her friends. If 
they were guilty of any violence, certainly 
they wouldnt aim any of it toward her. 
Jensen was wrong. And on the night of 
May 13,1994, a member of the Vice Lords 
shot her when she refused to let them 
take her car to rob a convenience store.
What does all of this matter to us, here 
at CMU, hundreds of miles from Iowa? 
Jensen was 17, not much younger than 
most of us. That alone lends her story 
significance in our here and now. But 
more than that, Jensen matters to us 
because her story is much like that of 
Javon Thompson, the freshman art major 
shot and killed in December by a gang 
member.
Thompson, like Jensen, was moving 
more or less along the straight and nar
row. He was a good student with tremen
dous talent. He openly expressed his con
tempt for the violence and hatred supportedby gangs, something he hadfought 
hard to stay away from all of his life. He 
was proud to be a student at CMU, and 
he brought a perspective to the art de
partment that no other freshman art 
student could offer.
Thompson tried to remove himself from 
the gang-polluted environment of his 
childhood. But in the end, it made no 
difference. On 
December 20,
Benjamin 
Wright, a known 
gang member, 
allegedly killed 
Thompson 
where he sat, 
playing video 
games with 
some friends.
And why? What 
had Thompson 
done to provoke 
an attack, to de
serve something 
so brutal and 
violent? Noth
ing.
There were 
20,00025,000 
gang members
in Los Angeles in 1980. Today there are 
over 140,000. The rates of growth are 
somewhat comparable in any urban area, 
including Pittsburgh. The United States 
government is now using laws initially 
intended to battle the Mafia to combat 
gang violence.
New federal statutes have been passed 
to specifically address drive-by shootings 
and assault with semi-automatic weap
ons. The probationary system imple
mented to handle delinquency cases con
cerning gang members is no longer ad
equate because the number of cases has 
become overwhelming. The cases deemed 
the. least urgent by the social agencies 
theyve been assigned to are required to
merely correspond with his or her proba
tion officer once a month by mail. At
tempts at cognitive restructuring, or 
teaching gang members to think differ
ently about their actions, have been only 
mildly effective. The success rate for those 
members that actually get into treat
ment is barely 50 percent.
The philosophy of intervention and reFrancine Gemperle/Tartan Art Co-Editor
habilitation of criminals that had its rise 
in the 50s and 60s has failed to accom
modate present conditions. Gangs are on 
the rise, and they are spreading like 
wildfire from the metropolises outward 
to the small towns and country backroads. 
We all know there is a significance and 
an urgency to this problem. Its making 
the cities unsafe. Its costing taxpayers 
dollars to keep these kids and young 
adults incarcerated if theyve been con
victed and out of jail if they havent. But 
above all, this problem demands our im
mediate attention because it has brought 
about the deaths of innocent people.
In a way, gang violence is like cancer 
if you dont live in the inner city, its
something that happens to someone else. 
Its never one of your friends or rela
tives, or even one of your neighbors. It 
always happens in some other town to 
some other family. When it comes to 
gang violence, thats the way many of us 
feel. But because of Thompson, its no 
longer something that occurs far from 
our backyards.
Thompson was one of ushe was our 
friend, our classmate, our peer, and he 
had the potential to be much more. He 
wasnt a casualty you read about in the 
paper, guiltily skimming the article and 
moving on to the comics.
He was someones son, someones 
grandson. He loved and was loved by 
others. He was part of our ranks. When 
we hear about a gang-related shooting 
on the news, we can no longer associate 
it with a nameless, featureless face. 
Thompson will always be there because 
of how he died, how he was taken away 
from us.
Gang violence kills the innocent  
little girls hit by stray bullets, elderly 
people, family members of opposing 
gangs, those who are in the wrong place 
at the wrong time. Thompson was inno
cent, and we must remember that. We 
must remember him. We can no longer 
think in terms of race, or sex, social 
class, or economic status.
We must remember that it happened 
to him and that it could happen to any of 
us. We cannot forget we should not let 
ourselves forget that he was ours and 
that the violence we never think about is 
always lurking about. The shadows took 
him from us and cannot give him back. 
The unnamed people who painted the 
CFA elevator had it right: When will 
the innocent stop being punished for 
their innocence?

Big government squanders economic growth
James Stepanek
This past Monday was Presi
dent Reagans birthday. Given 
his present medical condition 
confronting the long painful slide 
of Alzheimers Disease  most 
people have managed some sym
pathy for the man. Of course 
this does not bar most Demo
crats from attacking the 
Republicans Contract with 
America and the Evil Reagan 
Years. Lets face it, Reagans 
message, which was the mes
sage hammered in by the elec
tion, is now popularly accepted. 
Big government is not the solu
tion; it is the problem.
Reagan actually said it quite 
well: The scariest words you 
can hear are 'Were from the 
government and were here to 
help you.  Big government is 
not your friend. Why would it 
be? I was completely confused 
when people elected Clinton on 
the basis that he would change
things. Didnt people realize that 
change for the worse is not a good 
idea? His biggest proposal, Health 
Care Reform, was a horrifying 
attempt to expand the public role 
and put about 10 percent of the 
economy directly under govern
ment control. Since weve already 
seen what kind of a success wel
fare is, how could anyone expect 
a newer, bigger entitlement to be 
helpful?
The voters have decided that 
the change they want is not big 
government. The Republicans 
Contract with America was one 
of the hottest topics in this elec
tion. It was about letting people 
take back some of their lives from 
the government. It encompassed 
tax cuts, a balanced budget 
amendment, welfare reform, and 
term limits. The basic theme of it 
all was to remove power from the 
federal government, and make 
the government live within its 
means.
Not surprisingly, the Demo
crats came out and attacked the 
contract on the premise that it 
was just a replay of the 80sthe 
decade of greed. Its amazing 
how much propaganda has 
evolved about that decade al
ready. The left loves to lambaste 
the conservatives on this subject. 
Of course they are routinely 
spouting such things as the rich, 
got richer and the poor got poorer. 
No numbers are presented to back 
this claim since if someone both
ered to look this up theyd see
percent from $92,000 to $97,000. 
In either percent or actual dollar 
value the lowest income segment 
came out ahead. So the people got 
richer, and thats all.
It is often claimed that the defi
cit came about from the tax cuts. 
This is utter nonsense. SupplyWell here we have it Ive shown that 
you can't characterize the 80s as a 
decade of the rich get richer and 
the poor get poorer,  as the left 
would have you believe.
they were wrong. The lower in
come groups gained more in in
come than the top groups, and 
the decade moved more people 
into the upper income groups than 
any other shift in income. The 
general production of wealth also 
upped every ones income. The 
lowest 20 percent of incomes in
creased 70 percent from 1979 to 
1988 (in constant dollars) from 
about $16,000 to $28,000. The 
top fifth increased by only five
side economics were proved cor
rect in the 80s. While taxes fell 
revenues rose. In fact, even more 
of the tax burden was shifted to 
the rich. In 1979, the top 10 per
cent paid 49 percent of all income 
tax, while in 1989 this had gone 
up to 54 percent (note: this is 
before the disastrous Bush defi
cit reduction deal, and its reply 
 the Clinton Deficit Reduction 
Plan). If we had kept to the Graham-Rudman deficit reduction
rules we would have no deficit 
today (we should still, of course, 
have the debt to pay off).
Why is it so hard to under
stand that the economy is a dy
namic system? Face it, supplyside economics has to work. 
Taxes do have an effect on fiscal 
decisions. If you allow people to 
employ more of their money as 
they wish, then investments will 
flourish.
Well here we have it. Ive 
shown that you cant character
ize the 80s as a decade of the 
rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer, as the left would have 
you believe. It was a time when 
people were allowed to flex their 
economic muscle under lower 
taxes and less government in
terference.
People have finally come to 
remember the decade as it was, 
not as the liberal media would 
have you see it. The election of 
November 8 proved this, and 
now the left is running scared. 
Reagan was right.

Money obscures meaning of national pastime
ULmh tjtf
________Ronak Singhal
Bill Clinton came into office 
declaring a mandate for change 
that would include radical over
hauls of the health care and 
welfare systems. This past No
vember, the Republicans took 
control of both houses of Con
gress for the first time in 40 
years, saying that they will re
duce the governmental burden 
placed on citizens. Yet, this week 
the issue that was most dis
cussed in Washington was not a 
question of national security or 
personal responsibility; the most 
contentious issue in Washing
ton was the baseball strike. The 
strike, which has already forced 
the cancellation of one World 
Series, threatens to cause harm 
to our national pastime.
One thing that brought this 
strike is the division among own
ers about how small-market 
teams, such as Montreal and 
Pittsburgh, can compete with 
large-market teams, like New 
York or Chicago, that have more 
money. The argument that the 
small-market teams have is that 
large-market teams can go out 
and buy the best talent on the 
free agent market and therefore 
be more successful teams. The 
large-marketteams contend that 
this is not the case, because both 
Pittsburgh and Montreal, in re
cent years, have been extremely 
succesful, while both the New 
York Mets and Yankees have 
failed to reach the playoffs this 
decade.
The problem faced by teams 
like the Pittsburgh Pirates is that 
they can develop and harness 
great talent while the players are 
young, but once they become es
tablished, there is very little 
chance of keeping them, mainly 
because of the expense. In the 
case of the Pirates, they lost an 
MVP, Barry Bonds, and a Cy 
Young award winner, Doug 
Drabek; Montreal seemed poised
to win a pennant this past season 
and then dismantled a large 
majority of the team because they 
couldnt afford the star players.
One proposed solution was to 
create a system of revenue shar
ing among the teams, where the 
teams would evenly divide the 
majority of money each recieved 
from deals such as local radio 
and television broadcasting 
rights. The players had no real 
problem with this idea, except 
for one catch that the owners 
threw in, which was they said 
they would also need to imple
ment a salary cap, which would 
limit the amount of money each 
team could spend on salaries to 
an equal amount.
To the players, the idea was 
ludicrous because it would imple
ment a system where they would 
not be able to get what they per
ceived was their true market 
value. The owners, on the other 
hand, contended that the reason 
for such a cap would be to main
tain a competitive balance within 
the game. This point was never 
resolved, and the owners recently
agreed to abandon the idea of a 
cap.
Federal mediator W. J. Usery 
has laid a proposal on the table 
that the owners have agreed to, 
but the players refuse to accept. 
The players think the issue should 
go to binding arbitration, but the 
owners are not about to let a 
third party basically determine 
their financial future. The play
ers want a system that allows 
them to freely move between 
teams and obtain their true mar
ket value, while most owners 
would like a system that insti
tuted some sort of spending re
straint creating a financial bal
ance between teams. Since there 
is no obvious reconciliation of 
these ideas, the current situation 
has emerged. The owners say 
spring training on time and use 
replacement players, whether 
they be old, washed-up players or 
young players with no major 
league experience, to play the 
season. Obviously, such a result 
would not benefit anyone. The 
players would be stuck at home 
earning no money. The owners
would realize a steep loss in rev
enue because of the inevitable 
decrease in attendance. Clearly 
no one wants that to be the end 
result, yet both sides refuse to 
give in. Now, the problem ap
pears to be each side keeping its 
members on the same page. The 
Baltimore Orioles have said they 
would refuse to play with replace
ment players, while well-known 
players like Lenny Dykstra of the 
Philadelphia Phillies have said 
they will seriously consider cross
ing the picket lines and playing.
This ugly ordeal that the fans 
have been forced to sit through is 
just another aspect of the skewed 
nature of our society. Here are 
two sides, both of which have 
millionaires as their majority, yet 
both sides are so stubborn they 
refuse to consider the integrity of 
the game they are slowly destroy
ing with this strike. Now the most 
powerful person in America has 
offered his help, and still the two 
sides have been unable to come to 
an agreement. And, maybe worst 
of all, is the helpless group of 
people, such as vendors and ticket
takers, that are caught in the 
middle with no say in anything, 
but with maybe the most at stake.
So, whats a possible solution? 
Maybe the players should be allowed free agency after three or 
four years in the league, but clubs 
should receive compensation in 
return for losing these star play, 
ers. As for owners, they have the 
crisis of the high salary, so maybe 
no cap should be instituted. Let 
the clubs spend to their hearts 
content, and watch what hap. 
pens. I would bet that the teams 
with the the correct mixture of 
young, inexpensive stars and one 
or two superstars could be just as 
competitive as the high-salary 
clubs. Then again, maybe its time 
that the players and owners were 
forced to watch Field of Dreams, 
so that they remember that they 
have been the lucky beneficiaries of our national pastime, a 
game played in a park with noth
ing more than a piece of wood 
and a ball.

Racist jokes on bboard spark anger; show CMUs cultural ignorance
The Editors Notebook
"The Editor's Notebook presents the in
dividual opinion of the author only, not 
necessarily the opinions of The Tartan or 
of the Editorial Board.
America likes to classify individuals. 
Ironically, these classifications dont 
seem as offensive as other racist re
marks, especially when they are posted 
on the assocs.spirit bboard. How long
can ignorance be tolerated?
Recently, an upsetting message was 
posted on the National Society of Black 
Engineers and Spirit bboards.
Vincent Allen Krause, a student from 
the University ofMichigan, had his email 
account broken into. An anonymous 
source in the Organization for the Ex
ecution of Minorities (OEM) sent 1,000 
jokes and hate poems over the bboards 
in Krauses name.
This brings a few racial issues to mind. 
First, Professors Richard Hermstein 
and Charles Murray have, unfortu
nately, compromised Harvard 
Universitys reputation. They publish
ed a book, The Bell Curve, about black 
and white intelligence. It claimed that 
blacks and Hispanics dont have as high 
an IQ as Caucasians and will never be
able to learn at the same level. I would 
like to know how well Hermstein and 
Murray could learn and acquire knowl
edge as minorities in a Nigerian or Bra
zilian school.
Second, if forensic sleuths can tell the 
race of a corpse by measuring the skull, 
great! I agree that humans have varia
tions. Isnt that what makes everyone so 
different, so colorful, so tall, so skinny, 
so short, so whatever?
I cant believe that there are politically-correct people who came up with 
this idea that we are all the same. We 
arent all the same, but we would like to 
be treated as if we were. Decency is 
something we are always striving for, 
and that includes posts on electronic 
bboards.
At CMU, we are also ignorant because
our University has no cultural aware
ness. You say youre from Brazil and 
people think you speak Spanish. You 
ask them if they have a clue where 
Uganda is and they have to look it up on 
the map. We may know a hell of a lot 
about technology, the arts, and psychol
ogy, but we have no clue where others 
come from.
The truth is that we see many ethnic 
groups walking together on campus. I 
remember going to see Maverick, and 
the entire row in front of me were of 
Indian descent. There was not one Cau
casian, Hispanic, African American, or 
Asian among them.
From then on, I started realizing that 
at CMU you walk along with your own 
little tribe.
Its funny, because I have only been in
this country for two years and I am still 
questioned by others on how much 
American culture I am aware of, such as 
if I grew up watching the Brady Bunch. 
I have no clue what the Brady Bunch is, 
but I realize that American pop culture 
is based on a lot of TV.
I like what I grew up with  a little 
beach, some Samba and Bossa Nova, 
and even a couple of Carnivals  but 
that wont make me believe that other 
cultures, or other races, arent good 
enough for me to learn from. So, lets see 
if we can at least learn from others and 
not just from our computers other me
dia.

Volume 89. Issue 16_________________________________________________________The Tartan. Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 13 February 1995Tartans face difficulties on the road
By COREY ZINN
Tartan Staffwriter
With several players taking the night off due to 
injuries and sickness, CMITs hockey team lost an 
exhibition game Friday night to West Virginia 
Universitys B team, 8-7. The second line played 
extremely well, tallying six of the seven goals and 
giving up only one. Sophomore Ray Ardire once 
again proved his strengths on the ice by racking up 
another five goals, to lead the team with 19 this 
season  and he didnt even play the first semes
ter.
Play in the first 10 minutes of the game seemed 
a little sloppy and was not very interesting to 
watch. WVU got on the scoreboard first with 7:18 
remaining in the first period, on just their second 
shot of the game. This is not the first time that 
CMU has given up the first goal on an early shot, 
but they have always managed to escape with a 
win. In keeping with this trend, freshman Scott 
Fitzgerald tied the game just 32 seconds later on a 
power play goal, assisted by freshman defenseman 
Bryan Campo. With the exact same fine still out, 
Ardire put CMU ahead 21 just 40 seconds later, 
assisted by junior Sean Odell. With 52 seconds 
remaining in the period, Ardire got a high sticking 
penalty, putting WVU on the power play. But it 
was CMU who scored with five seconds left on a 
nice shorthanded effort by junior Roger Maddalena, 
assisted by senior John Cardillo. It was the only 
CMU goal ofthe night not scored by the second line. 
This put CMU up 3-1 at the end of one.
The second period belonged to WVU, though, as 
they scored three unanswered goals in a span of
less than five and a half minutes, two of these goals 
on power plays. These goals put WVU up 4-3 with 
5:33 left in the second. However, seven seconds 
later, Ardire added his second of the night to tie the 
game at four and finish off the second period 
scoring. In only his second game dressing, fresh
man goalie Shawn McClory saw his first action in 
goal as he started the third period, 
relieving sophomore Jon Kliegman,
CMITs lone goaltender for most of 
the season.
Ardire added his third goal of the 
game less than two minutes into the 
third period, assisted by Fitzgerald, 
to make it 5-4 CMU. Five minutes 
later, WVU tied the game. But Ardire 
was not finished, as he added two 
more goals less than two minutes 
apart. The first was a power play 
goal assisted by Odell and graduate 
student Tom Sullivan, and the sec
ond came on a beautiful, unassisted 
shorthanded effort. This put CMU 
up 7-5 with 6:56 remaining in the 
game. It remained that way until 
just under four minutes left to play, 
when WVU scored on three consecu
tive shots in a span of 1:13 to go 
ahead 8-7 with 2:44 remaining  
and that is the way the game ended.
When asked about McClorys per
formance in goal, Coach Fred 
Maddalena said, He had some nice 
saves early, but then we let them get 
open shots on him and we let them The Tartans
[WVU] get to him. You cant expect him to be Tom 
Barrasso in his first game.
Last Tuesday night, CMU won a thriller over the 
Community College of Allegheny County, 5-4. Al
though CCAC had a small squad of players, they 
played well and are a much better team than in 
previous years. Once again, CMU did not start the
Carnegie Mellon team bowls over competition
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Editor
In its debut season, the Carnegie 
Mellon bowling team is already showing its colors!
Last weekend, the team bowled in 
the Association of College Unions  
International (ACU-I) Region 4 In
tercollegiate Bowling Tournament, 
against collegiate teams from DC, 
Virginia, West Virginia, and Mary
land, as well as Pennsylvania.
The team, which was comprised of 
graduate student David Schwartz, 
sophomore Jin Fung, sophomore Jon 
Nedel, sophomore Gerald Ng, sopho
more Gene Tabone, and freshman 
Craig Weiner gave its best perfor
mance of the season. The team was 
awarded the third place spot in the 
tournament. This qualified the team 
to compete at the ACU-I National 
Team Championships in Omaha, Ne
braska on April 7-8.
The ranking alone is a miracle  
the team had competed in only four 
competitions, with rankings that 
would be expected from a team that 
had just been formed. But it looks 
like the weekly practices paid off. The 
team has a solid roster of good bowlers, 
and theyre getting better all the time.
The highlight of the tournament 
came when Tabone grabbed first place 
honors at the tournament, avaraging 
215.11 points over nine games. He 
also snagged an almost-perfect score
of 289! There are only two possible 
ways to achieve this score: 9 strikes 
with a spare and a nine in the 10th 
frame, or the same with another strike 
and nine pins in the tenth.
This has qualified Tabone to repre
sent Carnegie Mellon, as well as ACUI region four, in the ACU-I Mens 
Championship in Reno, Nevada on 
May 4 and 5.
Im really proud of these guys,
said Coach John Michalenko, We are 
finally in the winners circle! 
Overall, the teams performance is 
miraculous for an inaugural season, 
and theyre not through yet. In addi
tion to the championships that theyve 
qualified for, the team is slated to 
play at the Eagle Classic in Dayton, 
OH, February 11-12, and the Buck
eye Open in Columbus, OH, March 
4-5.
game off on the right foot. Play was a little sloppy, 
and with 11:13 remaining in the first, Maddalena 
got a 10 minute misconduct penalty. Just 13 sec
onds later, however, CMU took a 1-0 lead on a goal 
by Ardire, assisted by senior Dan Kodesh. But, 
with Maddalena in the box for 10 minutes, the lines 
got shuffled around, and their rhythm was dis
rupted. During this 10-minute span, CCAC scored 
three times to take a 3-1 lead into the second 
period.
The tone shifted in the second, and both teams 
racked up the shots. CCAC took 15 shots on 
Kliegman that period, and CMU had 18. The result 
was a 4-3 advantage for CCAC at the end of two. 
CMUs second goal of the game was scored by 
Maddalena, assisted by Cardillo and freshman 
defenseman Paul Voulgaris. Their other tally that 
period was Ardires second of the game, assisted by 
sophomore defenseman Chris Adukaitis and 
Fitzgerald.
CMU took the ice in the third period knowing 
that they could pull this off, being a strong third 
period team. But after ten minutes had expired in 
the third, the score was still 4-3 CCAC. A CMU fan 
heard CCACs assistant coach say to their coach, 
This is a big win. But he forgot one thing: there 
were still seven minutes left to play. With six and

did add a little punch as 
she scored 8 points for the

were seriously hurt by 
their poor shooting per

31 percent from the field 
and an atrocious 29 per

stripe.
Seidl said, I wish we

the ball a little bit more.

with 19 points. He also tallied 
three rebounds. Captain Steve 
Athanas, a senior, contributed
12 points and eight assists in the 
losing effort.
Both junior Jon Blanciak and 
freshman Andy Sofish led CMU 
with eight rebounds apiece. 
Blanciak registered nine points 
while Sofish tallied six.

Philly third-baseman deserves Hall of Fame honors
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
The Hall of Fame is the pinnacle of 
achievement. Whether it be in Rock n 
Roll or basket weaving, induction into a 
Hall of Fame of any sort defines excel
lence.
Recently the greatest baseball player 
in the city of brotherly love, and the 
greatest third baseman in the history of 
the game, was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame.
Mike Schmidt, known in Philadelphia 
as Schmiddy, manned the hot corner 
for the Phils from 1971-1989. In that 
time, he accumulated incredible statis
tics including 10 Gold Gloves, 548 home 
runs (7th all time), 3 National League 
Most Valuable Player awards, and 2234 
hits.
Even the most blatant bandwagon fan 
knows that 500 home runs is an instant 
ticket to the Hall of Fame. So when 
Schmidt surpasses that mark by 48, and 
sets the standard in a number of other 
categories, why would 16 of the lucky 
people who are bestowed with the privi
lege to cast Hall of Fame ballots, not vote 
for Schmidt?
This brings up the often debated ques
tion of what exactly is required to enter 
a Hall of Fame?
Several of the 16 voters cited that 
Schmidt did not have the necessary char
acter for the Hall.
Okay, if character is an issue, will some
body please tell me why Ty Cobb, prob
ably the most vile man in the history of that his 
baseball, currently has a plaque in reasons 
Cooperstown?
Cobb once rushed into the stands in the 
middle of a game to beat a fan with no 
legs, because of the fans heckling. Was 
that an act of character in the 1920s?
Why are Wilt Chamberlain and Janis 
Joplin both in their respective Hall of 
Fame? Chamberlain claimed to have slept 
with over 10,000 women, while Joplin
used drugs excessively. Were these acts of 
character, or was character defined differ
ently for other entertainers?
One local Philadelphia baseball writer 
stated ____________________________

If character is to be an issue, that is fine 
I am not in disagreement with that, forj

Voting for the Hall of Fame isn't a game, 
nor should it be a place for politics. It is 
simply a recognition of the best.
Apparently Schmidt didnt play the me
dia game, the way it was supposed to be 
played. He was never the darling of the 
public in the manner that 
Ken Griffey Jr. is today, 
nor did he make an at
tempt to steal the head
lines like Ricky 
Henderson.
He was quiet, cool, 
even-tempered, but most 
importantly a damn good 
ballplayer. And if the me

it is to be an issue, then it is time for it to 
become an issue across the board, and not 
just on the whims of the writers.
It is time to eliminate the state of limbo 
which some of the greats as Pete Rose and 
even Shoeless Joe Jackson are in. Their 
actions off the field were no worse than 
anything Cobb did on the field.
Then again, everything else has gone 
the way of arbitration these days, so I 
wouldnt be surprised if Hall of Fame vot

too much early.
The 15-point halftime lead 
was extended to 26 within five 
minutes. When CMU did mount 
a comeback and reduced the 
deficit to only 14 points, Wash
ington went on a 12-0 run to 
squash any possibilities for 
CMU to return to the game.
With the loss, CMU fell to 
11-10 overall and 5-6 in con
ference play. Athanas had an
other solid game at point. He 
shot well as he went 5-9 from 
the field with 18 points and 
four 3-point shots. He also 
pulled down four rebounds.
Byrne contributed 15 points 
and seven boards while 
Blanciak added 12 points and 
four rebounds. Sophomore Rich 
Bodnar grabbed six off the glass
for the Tartans.
Important contributions were 
put in by the bench. Junior Steve 
Hartman came in to score six 
points and really hustled on de
fense. Sofish contributed four 
points and three rebounds, and 
in the words of his coach he 
played hard and competed. 
Weve been learning all year 
long, Wingen said of the loss. 
Games like this you store in your 
memory bank.
The game was marred by a 
number of technical fouls. 
Carnegie Mellon picked up two 
technical fouls. Bodar v/as called 
for yelling at the referee for miss
ing a call while Athanas was 
whistled for slapping the ball from 
the inbounding player after he 
scored.
Perhaps the most disturbing
foul was called against Coach 
Edwards of Washington for an 
obscene comment he made to 
CMU junior Eric Ronzio after he 
had fouled out of the game.
We have four games left and I 
think we can win them all. This 
season will be a good start for this 
group of players as we graduate 
only Athenas, the coach said.
The Tartans are now 5-7 in 
UAA play. Overall, they are .500 
with 11 wins and losses.
The Tartans host Thiel College 
on Friday and play away at Emory 
University on Sunday. After the 
matchup with Emory University, 
they have only one more UAA 
game against the University of 
Rochester.

This past Saturday, the 
Carnegie Mellon crew team met 
crew teams from all over the area 
in the A.J. Paulmbo Center at 
Duquesne University to battle it 
out in an annual indoor crew com
petition. Among the other com
petitors were Pitt, Duquesne, 
Ohio State, and various high 
school teams and local rowing 
clubs.
The competitors rowed for time 
in what would be 2500 meter 
races, although all actual rowing 
was done on rowing machines. 
Computers keep track of distance.
The womens team was seri
ously handicapped going in, as 
three of their five members were 
unable to row due to various inju
ries.
However, the mens teams were 
in full force. In the Novice Mens
category, freshman Urs Batzel 
won with a time of 8:25, beating 
more than 15 other rowers. In 
the Mens Open, Carnegie 
Mellon came back with medals 
for second and third place fin
ishes.
Senior Soren Roth was 
awarded the second place medal 
for his time of 8:14 and junior 
George Scotts time of 8:36 gave 
him the third place medal.
Roth was very pleased with 
this performance, because the 
only person who beat them was 
an ex-Rumanian Olympic rower.
There are no more indoor row
ing machine competition for the 
CMU crew team. The team is 
preparing for the start of the 
outdoor competitions by indoor 
rowing machine practices and 
weight training.
The spring season is sched
uled to start in the first weeks of 
March, but it is subject to change.

Lonely writer seeks 
referee improvements
Now HonestLy!
by Eric Applewhite & 
Corey Zinn
This week, Eric is out of town so 
Corey will discuss the situation 
between referees and linesmen.
Due to my partners absence 
this week, I must write this one 
without him. So I will discuss 
what I think about the single 
referee/two linesmen scheme, and 
how this might be improved.
As the NHL stands now, there 
is only one referee able to call 
penalties, and two linesmen to 
call offsides, icing, and two-line 
offside passes. The linesmen do 
have the authority to tell the ref
eree who instigated a fight, if 
they had a better view than the 
ref, but that is as far as it goes 
when it comes to calling penal
ties.
This is unfortunate. Often pen
alties such as holding, interfer
ence, roughing, etc. happen be
hind the play and out of sight of 
the referee.
If the ref doesnt see it, its not 
a penalty. Thats the attitude a 
lot of players have, and currently, 
thats the way it is.
In many of these cases, one of 
the linesmen did see the penalty,
but is powerless to do anything 
about it. This is where changes 
could be made.
There are two possible changes 
that could improve upon the cur
rent situation. First, the NHL 
could go to a two referee/one lines
man arrangement, but this could 
turn into a power struggle be
tween the two referees.
The other possibility is to keep 
one referee and two linesmen, 
but give the linesmen the author
ity to call all minor penalties. All 
major penalties and misconducts 
would still be only at the discre
tion of the referee.
Some people might argue that 
this puts too much responsibility 
on the linesmen. Maybe so, but 
their primary role is still as lines
men, and the penalty-calling role 
would probably occur more be
hind the play and thus not hinder 
their regular duties all that much, 
or interfere with the responsibili
ties of the referee too much.
I think that in general, the ref
erees do a fantastic job of keeping 
most games under control. How
ever, situations do arise when 
the job becomes overwhelming 
for one person, and it is for this 
reason that I believe linesmen 
should be given authority to call 
minor penalties. Thats the way I 
see it.
Corey Zinn is a senior MSEf 
Econ major who hopes Eric will 
return from the penalty box next 
week so they can argue about some 
other NHL topic.
Sports Illustrated mistreats NBA
Below the Rim
by Darren Chiappetta
All right, its been two weeks. By now, the 
fan base of this column is well-established. 
Ive received mail from as far away as 
Donner Hall, so I know Ive hit the big-time. 
With this kind of support, Im confident 
that writing a below-average column will 
not affect my readership (all three of you). 
Besides, a below-average column  Below
The Rim  fits right _________________
in with the theme.
Is it May, already?
For the second time in 
three weeks, Sports Il
lustrated had a pro
fessional basketball 
player on its cover.
This is the sport that 
receives about as
much coverage in SI _________________
as Americas Cup sailing. (By the way, any
one know how that all-female crew is do
ing?) People may dispute that claim, but 
think about it. How many times have you 
seen a feature article on pro hoops before 
the playoffs start? Normally, they just give 
it a few pages in the back of the magazine.
This week, the magazine profiles Anfemee 
Hardaway of the Orlando Magic (for you 
native Burghians, thats a professional bas
ketball team). What the article says is not 
important, although its pretty favorable 
toward Penny (Hardaway's nickname).
This cover story contrasted sharply with 
the one that appeared two weeks ago. The
new batch of players in the NBA. Author Phil 
Taylor talked about overpriced, high-maintenance stars like Derrick Coleman of the 
Nets, who, according to Taylor, seem to have 
little respect for anything but the almighty 
dollar.
Surprisingly, Taylor was also the author of 
the Hardaway article. After the first article, 
youd think there would be a league-wide 
rule barring Taylor from entering locker 
rooms. I can just see the poster: Not Wanted: 
Phil Taylor. He made fun of us. Dont let him 
in unless he can offer us restricted free agency 
and the chance to renegotiate our contracts 
after one season.
Of course, Taylor probably did most of his 
Hardaway research before the first article 
appeared. The players Taylor interviewed, 
including Anfemee, might not have known 
he was going to do a hatchet job on them.
Personally, I have to agree with much of 
what Taylor said in the first article. But I
cover read, Waaaah! and talked about the
I can just see the poster: Not Wanted: Phil 
Taylor. He made fun of us. Dont let him in 
unless he can offer us restricted free 
agency and the chance to renegotiate our 
contracts after one season. 
dont have to try and ask these men for 
interviews night after night like he does. 
Bravo for a gutsy article.
Who knows? Maybe Taylor was trying to 
put the famed Sports Illustrated jinx on 
Hardaway, whom he mentioned briefly in 
the first article. Hardaway held out in con
tract disputes his first two seasons. After 
signing a 13-year, $65 million contract his 
rookie year, he exercised the right to renego
tiate his contract. He then signed a nineyear, $70 million deal.
The guard with the great all-around game 
and the fat contract also gets to play for the 
team with the best record in the Eastern
Conference, a record he has a lot to do with. 
He doesnt sound jinxed to me.
Speaking of hexes, Below The Rim has 
claimedits first victim. The week after hyping 
up UMass right here in this column, the 
number one team in college basketball loses 
to George Washington. In their defense, the 
Minutemen were playing on the road, and 
had to be getting tired of beating up on their 
Atlantic-10 foes. Oh yeah, UMass was also 
missing center Marcus Camby, out with an 
injured knee. Think it had something to do 
with it? Once Camby gets back (hes sched
uled to come back in a few weeks), UMass 
will be fine. Look for at least a Final Eight 
appearance from them.
Staying on the college front, congratula
tions are in order for Pete Gaudet. Gaudet is 
the Duke assistant coach forced to take over 
for Mike Kryszewski. Coach K left the team 
with back problems in January.
Duke finally won its first Atlantic Coast 
Conference game Thursday 
in a 77-71 decision over 
18th-ranked Georgia Tech. 
Its hard to feel bad for Duke 
(I hate them) but you have 
to root for a guy who, be
cause of a change in NCAA 
rules regarding payroll for 
assistant coaches, is run
ning one of the top pro______________ grams in the country for
$16,000 a year. The Blue 
Devils are now 11-12 for 
the season. Who wouldve thunk it?
Thats all for this week, kids. I hope it 
wasnt too painful to read. There are two 
quick notes I want to mention before I wrap 
it up this week. First, the NBA All-Star 
Weekend was this weekend. I could say some
thing, but I dont want to. You saw all of it, 
from the Schick Last-Man-On-the-Bench 
Game to the Gatorade Under-6'0"-Blindfolded 
Slam Dunk Championship. Second, my in
tramural team is 0-2, and things arent look
ing good for the three-peat. Gotta go practice.

a half minutes remaining, se
nior defenseman P.J. Mann

away, until there was barely a 
minute left.
Thats when it happened. 
Kodesh, with a fine display of

step around the goaltender and

Beaux Arts Ball: After the Hype
Sam Greenfield/Tartan Contributing Editor
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Diversions Editor 
& NATALIE WOCHELE
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
On many levels, the Beaux Arts Ball brought its patrons what it 
promised. Ticket buyers were promised a fully-catered meal, many bands 
on three different stages, and a building filled with art. The Ball delivered 
all of these things. We asked some students what they thought of the Ball. 
New Yorks Milo Z was excellent. Their set was funky, rockm, and crowdpleasing. Perhaps if these boys had played us to the end of the night, more 
people would have left the Ball feeling like they had gotten a good show for 
their 25 bucks.
Joe Fria (Sophomore, Drama) said, [There was] good music, but they 
could have gone farther with places to roam, while Anita Sra (Freshman, 
MCS) said, In general, it was alright, and some of the bands were good.
On other levels, however, it failed. For one thing, there was no headline 
band. Well, thats not entirely accurate; Squonk Opera did take the stage 
at 1 am, and did an okay job. Squonk Opera, however, is a local group, 
whose theatrically antic-riddled numbers tend to stunt their acceptance in 
mainstream audiences. CMlPs own Frankenstein put on a set worthy of 
the mainstage. It was sad to see them put up on the third floor, when 
mediocre bands had been allowed to start the center stage that night. At 
1 am, the fully-catered meal was finally served to the largest number of 
gatherers that night. It was then that reality dawned on the ravenous 
patrons: when its veal brought by a caterer, they call it veal. When its 
steak brought by a caterer, they call it steak. When its pasta with a Ragutype sauce and undercooked chicken brought by a caterer, they call it a 
fully-catered meal. All in all, we would have been just as well off leaving 
for a Highlander break, but that wasnt an option, since there was no 
reentry allowed after 1 am. The food and drink ran out by 1:30. If it ran 
out that fast for the 400-500 people who showed, what would have 
happened if they had sold the 1000 tickets they had set their aspirations 
on?
As for the theme of the Ball (The Inner Apple: An Epicurion Ecstacy 
Exposed), the closest thing to ecstacy we saw were the people making out 
on the leather couch in the Music mezzanine. And, of course, there were all 
those helpful policemen on duty to make sure that no form of fornication, 
drug use, or anything fun happened. Its hard to live the life of an Epicurion 
when you cant even kiss without a flashlight being shoved in your face.
Please see BEAUX, page Lll
Frankenstein (top left) was one of the first acts to play the 1995 Beaux 
Arts Ball on the third floor of CFA. They displayed a great knowledge anr1 
chemistry In their performance, and rocked many. If this were an ides 
worid, they would have played on the main stage, where Squonk Oper 
(above) finished the evening with their theatrically dynamic show. Thi 
level of appreciation of Squonk Opera among the audience members wa; 
as varied as the wide range of costumes worn by the masqueraders. Somi 
turned themselves Into beings of stone (right), using ample supplies o 
white paint and other unidentified mediums, while others turned their hai 
into sculptures of stone (below), using ample supplies of hair gel, as dli 
Ryan Douglas (Sophomore, Art). Despite a large amount of mediocrit 
among the various acts, New York Citys Milo Z (bottom left) rose abov< 
the rest with a funk-fusion vibe that demanded to be heard. But, as mucl 
as they could save the party feeling at the Ball, they could not save th< 
buffet (left) from Its swift and Inevitable doom, as it was demolished upoi 
its unveiling.

By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
It was a cool midday in October, and I 
was standing outside of Baker Hall. 
Leaves and debris littered the sidewalk. 
I was wondering why nobody was clean
ing it up since there were three Facility 
Management employees standing be
hind me whistling and making explicit 
sexual comments about my body.
When I approached them and asked 
them for their names they just laughed. 
The tall one said, Well now honey, Ill 
tell you my name if you tell me yours.
I was appalled by this incident be
cause I never expected to be so humili
ated by the employees of the university 
that I pay around $24,000 a year to 
attend.
I found it hard to believe that a presti
gious school like CMU would even allow 
workers to fraternize with students, let 
alone sexually harass them.
I had to endure similar instances of 
harassment on a regular basis while I 
was waiting for my ride to pick me up on 
Frew Street behind Hunt Library. I felt 
afraid and violated. Finally, I decided to 
do something about it.
Through some interviews and research 
I found out that many girls on campus 
have been sexually harassed by Facility 
Management workers.
Emily Pihlquist, a sophomore, was 
subjected to sexual harassment by a 
Facilities Management worker when she 
worked as a desk attendant at the Mudge 
House.
The worker persistently tried to ask 
her out and talk to her even after she 
told him she wasnt interested. When 
she missed work for a few days because 
she was sick, he somehow got her phone 
number and called her. He called her 
five or six times over a two-week period, 
asked her why she wasnt at work, and 
asked her out on dates.
The most frightening experience for 
Pihlquist was when the worker called at 
7:3 0 in the morning and told her that her 
boyfriends friends were downstairs 
waiting for her.
Pihlquist recalls, I was so scared be
cause I had no idea how he knew my 
boyfriend was in my room. It was scary, 
I thought he was stalking me or some
thing.
Pihlquist also said that the worker 
used to ask her friends about her and 
would ask her about the things he had 
learned.
Unfortunately, even though Pihlquist 
no longer works at the Mudge House, 
she still sees this worker 
on campus, and he still 
tries to talk to her. It 
really scared me that he 
still remembers the 
music I listened to a year 
ago at work.
Amy, a sophomore,
spoke about her harass- ____________
ment in the hopes that iOBBranm 
something would be 
done about it. She was working late in 
the Baker Hall computer cluster when 
she was sexually harassed.
It was after midnight, and her boy
friend had just left when Amy walked 
down the deserted hallway to the bath
room. A Facilities Management worker 
stopped her and asked her for her name.
She answered, and he asked, Are you 
into the interracial thing? She ignored 
him and kept walking. Then he asked, 
Would you ever get with a black guy? 
When I asked Amy how she felt she 
said, I felt afraid. I dont go there any
more at night by myself. Im afraid I 
might see him.
Ann, a junior, told me that when she 
was a sophomore, she was harassed by 
one of the workers. Ann left the Marga
ret Morrison cluster at 11 pm and began 
walking on Forbes Avenue towards her
Doherty apartment. A worker driving available. One pamphlet, entitled 
one of CMUs Physical Plant trucks Sexual Harassment: A Community 
pulled up next to her and asked her if Concern, is available at the center and
she needed a ride.
She answered with a quick no and 
continued walking. He asked her if she 
wanted to party while motioning to
wards his mouth, implying he wanted to 
smoke some marijuana.
Realizing that she was all alone on the 
street, Ann became nervous and started 
to walk faster. Do you wanna FK? 
he yelled from the truck. She started to 
run. She ran straight to her dorm and 
told her resident advisor what happened.
I was so scared. I thought he was
It would have been my word against his ... 
I just wanted to forget about it as soon as 
possible.
 Ann, an anonymous junior
going to grab me. I felt like crying, said 
Ann. Her reason for not reporting the 
incident was similar to every girls rea
son for not reporting sexual harassment
 It would have been my word against 
his ... I just wanted to forget about it as 
soon as possible.
Another reason why people dont re
port being harassed is that they are 
afraid they will not be able to identify 
the person because, as Ann puts it, 
didnt want to encourage him by looking 
at him.
The Womens Center is a resource 
which has much information about 
sexual harassment. Amber Benezra, a 
staff worker at the Center, said that 
there is a Sexual Harassment Advisory 
Panel that was created to handle sexual 
harassment complaints.
There are also informative pamphlets
explains how Carnegie Mellon defines 
sexual harassment, as well as what to do 
if you are harassed.
According to the pamphlet, Carnegie 
Mellon defines sexual harassment as 
any unwelcome sexual advances, re
quests for sexual favors or other verbal, 
written, pictorial, nonverbal or physical 
conduct of a sexual nature. It goes on to 
explain that there are two types of sexual 
harassment. The first involves an iden
tifiable economic or academic benefit or 
loss... In the second type, an individual 
is subject to a sexu
ally offensive or in
timidating environ
ment.
I just started in 
May and I never 
heard of anything. 
Personally I dont
________________ talk to students because I just figure 
they have enough on 
their minds with school, said Neal, a 
Facilities Management employee.
Two other workers, who did not want 
their names mentioned, also said that 
they were never informed about a sexual 
harassment policy.
It appears that CMU has neglected to 
educate the workers about the issue.
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student Af
fairs, and member of the Sexual Harass
ment Advisory Panel, said that CMU 
does not have a policy which prohibits 
Facilities Management workers to frat
ernize with students.
In fact, Murphy said that the workers 
are permitted to interact with students 
and are even allowed to ask students out 
on dates.
When questioned about his knowledge 
of complaints of sexual harassment, 
Murphy stated that he was aware of
only one incident of sexual harassmei:: 
between a worker and a student. Th: 
incident involved a housekeeper in 
of the dorms.
Apparently, the housekeeper was leer
ing at a particular student and watchei 
every time the student walked down thi 
hall. Murphy said he responded to thi 
incident by transferringthe housekeeper 
to a different dorm.
According to Murphy, sexual harass
ment is not common between student; 
and the Facility Management workers; 
however, sexual harassment occurs more 
frequently between faculty and 
ate students.
Murphy advises students that if thej 
are being harassed by a worker, the; 
should be clear and honest by saying 
Im really not interested, and I woul: 
appreciate it if you did not ask me in the 
future. He also said that student: 
should report the incidents if the un1 
come behavior .persists., He said, An? 
meeting would be confidential.
The good news is that something 
going to be done about the sexual ha
rassment that students endure. MurpbJ 
said that he will address the problem t 
all of the Facilities Management Sei 
vices supervisors.
He plans to organize mandatory meet' 
ings for the entire department. M 
dressing the problem personally alio"-1 
the workers to ask their own question! 
to find out if their behavior is inapp# 
priate.
The sexual harassment issue 
Carnegie Mellon is not solved. Mai) 
people must speak up and get involve 
in order to solve this dilemma.
There are many resources avail 
to students on campus: you can go to tfo 
Womans Center located at 105 Marg* 
ret Morrison Street, or contact a 
ber of the Sexual Harassment Advisotf 
Panel by calling x8-2922 for a list 
advisors.

The Chinese New Year, which 
is timed to the lunar calendar, is 
probably, if not, the most signifi
cant holiday in the Chinese cul
ture. The earliest observance of 
this reknown Chinese holiday 
began in the 1850s. The Year of 
the Boar began last Tuesday.
The Chinese years progress in 
a cycle of twelve with twelve ani
mals coinciding: rat, ox, tiger, 
hare, dragon, serpent, horse, 
sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and 
boar. In the cyclical round of 
years, the year 2000 will be the 
year of the dragon.
Of the twelve animals in the 
Chinese lunar calendar, the boar, 
symbolizes wealth. Similar to 
what astrologolist do, traditional 
Chinese societies assign certain 
characteristic to those born in 
certain years.
Those who are bom in.the Year 
of the Boar are supposed to be 
open-hearted, true, and very op
timistic. They have numerous 
companions and are 
extremely efficient. ^
Their only down- ff
fall is that 
they tend to 
be extremely 
stubborn and need 
to learn to deal with situa
tions in a more flexible manner.
The most cheerful New Years 
salutations is Gung hay fa choy, 
Catonese for good luck and pros
perity, and Ksung hsi fa tsai, 
Mandarin for Best wishes for 
good fortune.
Traditionally, Chinese families 
gather together to bring in the 
new year by preparing 10- or 12- 
course banquets. Special dishes 
are prepared, each having a spe
cific symbolic meaning. For ex
ample, clear rice noodles, one of 
the many dishes served during 
the New Year, symbolize longev
ity. New clothes should be worn 
on New Year day with at least 
one article of clothing being red. 
There should be no swearing, 
nor any bearing of bad 
thoughts, because it 
is believed this 
is the manner in which 
we will be
have for the rest 
of the year.
Colorful lion and dragon 
dances can be seen in the streets 
of Chinatowns around the coun
try. Firecrackers are believed to 
scare away the evil spirits.
The most popular custom is the 
distribution of red envelopes con
taining money, which are distrib
uted by adults to children and 
unmarried young adults.
Junior Computer Science ma
jor, Haw Juin Lin, had this to say 
about the New Year. I was bom 
in 1974  thats the year of the 
tiger. Ive celebrated with my 
family before, but since Ive been 
at CMU. I havent really done 
anything. I think of it, though, 
when Im someplace where 
theres a lot of Chinese people. 
Its cool because you can tell whos 
aware of the new year and who 
isnt, and its a nice feeling to 
know that people other than your
self are thinking about it.
At home my family would cel
ebrate, and we had some family 
customs that we did every year. 
My mom would make dumplings 
every new year, because the 
dumplings have spinach in them 
and since the spinach looks like 
money, its considered good luck. 
Out of all the dumplings, my mom 
would put a piece of garlic in one, 
and whoever got the dumpling 
with the garlic  that person 
would have good luck for the new 
year.
Also, wed eat fish, but we only 
ate half. The whole fish would be 
lying flat on the plate, and youd 
eat the side facing up at you. 
Now, fish and boats are both in 
the water, right? So its unlucky 
to eat the other half because you 
have to flip the fish, and flipping 
the fish over would be like flip
ping a boat over. And flipping a 
boat over is usually bad. So, on 
new years you dont flip the fish 
because it might bring bad luck 
for the rest of the year.
Performance artist Vanessa 
Chow had this to add about her 
personal experience with Chinese 
New Year.
When I lived in Hong Kong we 
would have a week off from school, 
which was nice. I remember that 
you werent supposed to clean 
anything for something like a 
week. So, I wouldnt wash my 
hair for a week. Youre not 
supposed to scrub any
thing or sweep the floor, either 
and I remember my grandmothei 
would complain if anyone starts 
to sweep or clean anything off. 
havent celebrated it for fou, 
years, though, and I havent really noticed many people payinj 
attention to the New Year 
CMU.
In addition to the individu; 
forms of celebration express 
above, there are many 
oppportunities to bring in the 
New Year with others in the 
greater Pittsburgh area.
Ying-Pong Chen, a second year 
graduate student in GSIA, 
president of the University Chinese Club of Pittsburgh, said 
organization sponsored a dinner 
at a Chinese restaurant down
town. Over 100 people attended,1 
said Chen.
The Pittsburgh branch of the 
Chinese American Organization 
also had a party in which 
people attended. In March, this 
organization sponsors an event 
whose procedes go to poor people 
in Pittsburgh. People can buy tick
ets for this event at the Chinese 
New Year event.
Last year, ASA held a Lunar 
New Years celebration with 
traditional dinner, dragon dance 
and talent show in the Skibo ball
room. Due to complete lack d 
location this year, we opted togs 
ice-skating together as a group tt 
celebrate this New Year, 
Jessica Fang, President of ASA

Snowy weather dampens life
Horror Stories
By Tom Harper
Each day here at CMU has its 
own trials and tribulations  
some mundane, some extraordi
nary, some really out of this world, 
and some a mixture of all of the 
three. Like it or not, these little 
things are often the sum of an 
entire day.
When one sits back and reflects 
on the day (often with enough 
swearingto make a sailor cringe), 
these little things tend to stand 
out from the rest.
For example, in the Hunt Apple 
Orchard, the shelves beneath the 
tables are a godsend for weary 
feet whose only purpose is to 
shuttle our extraordinary minds 
from one place to another.
Amongthe more salient ofthese 
little things are the power out
lets mounted in some bread box 
 like an apparatus whose only 
other purpose in life is to get you 
to stub your toes (Yaouch!!!).
If anyone ever noticed me limp
ing out of Hunt, that was prob
ably the reason why. I will soon 
have to remedy my swollen and 
blistering toes by filing a lawsuit 
with the powers that be at CMU. 
I am sure that I would spend 
thousands of (valuable?) collegebound-dollars to instigate this 
legal battle. I probably would not 
win it either. However, the rights 
from the made-for-TV movie 
would probably over-compensate 
for this fact.
Until then, I will have to en
dure a sea of stubbed toes, and all 
the annoying little things of life 
in the burgh, such as the snow.
Along with the snowfall every 
winter comes snow melting into 
dirty puddles a few days later. 
This is the result of...
a) a rare appearance ofthe sun.
b) less wind to make it feel like 
-38 degrees.
c) trod-on snowballs thrown by 
people who have gotten at least 
1250 on their SATs.
d) the mines worth of salt 
dumped on the sidewalks.
Of course the salt happens to 
find its way into your clothing 
and is really irritating to the skin.
Where do they get this stuff, 
anyway? And how much does it 
cost? Does it involve those tu
ition hikes?
Lately, Ive been wearing my 
E&S Library name tag almost 
everywhere I go. This is another 
attempt of mine to start some 
kind of trend (apparently my hat 
trend succeeded).
Of course one major disadvan
tage is that whenever I get into a 
conversation with someone and 
they recognize my name tag, they 
must tell me of their horrid expe
riences they had at E&S trying to 
locate a book, use a copy ma
chine, etc.
(Note to E&S patrons: if you
cant find a book and you have 
indeed looked everywhere, yet 
the system says its available, 
ask to fill out a tracer form. Well 
find it. And we can only sell 
copicards for exact cash on week
ends!) There are also various 
small ways to entertain yourself 
no matter where you are or how 
many people are near you.
A good way is to keep repeat
ing redrum in a scratchy voice 
like that kid in The Shining. 
This works especially well in 
most waiting areas (especially a 
doctors).
And, if youre really into really 
spooky everyday stuff, there is 
this other guy on campus who 
looks almost exactly like me! He 
even wears the same hat as I do!
I have heard on a couple of 
occasions that he has indeed 
been confused with me, and I 
can tell you for certain its hap
pened the other way around.
It drives me stark raving nuts 
sometimes. I see him in the li
brary sometimes. I just hope he 
doesnt tell me his bad experi
ences about finding books.
The years have not been kind to 
Tom Harper, but he still sur
vives. The only thing that really 
amazes him now are people who 
come up to him at the Library 
desk and ask, Where are your 
books'?

Bboards host diverse interestsAmerican Dream lives on
Ritters Diner: sitting next to American Dream
Out about Town
By Laura McClure
Pete Velisaris spells his last name 
loudly and carefully. People have been 
confused before by his thick Greek 
accent, only one remnant of his up
bringing in the Old World.
He is a formidable man with a twice 
broken nose  he doesnt elaborate; I 
dont ask. This is not a man you would 
want to cross, and yet when he smiles 
you cant help but join him.
Like most of the other 2 a.m. main
stays of Ritters, Pete Velisaris is a 
paradox. He left Greece when he was
16 to follow the all-American dream of 
owning his own business, and for the 
past 28 years hes done just that. To 
him, Ritters is much more than a res
taurant. It is proof positive that The 
Dream still exists; it stands as a monu
ment to the entrepreneurial spirit.
How did he do it? Says Pete, What 
made us was the willingness of my 
brothers and me to work together to 
overcome the difficulties. When I came 
from the old country I always wanted 
to be in business, so l started by saving
my lunch money. That kind of deter
mination also applied to schooling.
Two years after Pete arrived in 
America, he started high school. At 
22, he was the oldest graduate in his 
class, but he made it. After that came 
two years of business school, and then 
Pete was on his way, working his way 
up through the diner hierarchy.
But it was the people who have main
tained his interest. In nearly 40 years 
of business, Pete has witnessed break
ups, pick-ups, riots, and rock stars. 
When you have worked as a busboy, a 
waiter, and a cook you see everything, 
he says,  and I have seen many, many 
people movie stars, baseball greats
 you name them, I have served 
them.
He points to a college student sitting 
at the counter. Who knows? he says, 
maybe that guy is a dreamer, too. 
Pete smiles.
For any dreamers who will listen, 
Pete has advice: Get your thoughts 
and your mind set early in your life
time and pursue them, because you 
might not have enough time later. 
Time goes too fast, do you see? In 
anything you do, you have to start 
yesterday. Can you start yesterday? 
No. Thats whats important. He sa
lutes. Heres hoping you started yes
terday.

Old Man Donner rediscovers Italy
Old Man Donner
By Jason Roth
Like all good Americans, Old Man 
Donner borrows liberally from other cui
sines in order to create his own inimi
table style.
However, most food mutates during 
the long passage across the ocean to this 
country, and rarely do you find the true 
;e of whatever nation youre trying 
this week.
In keeping with my international repu
tation for bringing you the straight shit, 
Im going to do my part to reverse this 
trend. For the next couple weeks Ill be 
giving you columns featuring authentic 
international dishes.
This week: Italian. For most Ameri
cans, Italian food is -------------------------
ily what the average student in a dorm 
needs to stretch $5 until next week, but 
it is what you need if you want to get the 
hell out of replacement training camp 
and into the Big Leagues.
So while you may not take Marcillas 
advice to avoid dry basil at all costs, you 
can certainly learn what it is that makes 
every step of the simplest tomato sauce 
so important.
At any rate, while this book may be 
beyond the average students means, 
Ive got a copy, and thats enough for all 
of us for now.
Im going to paraphrase a little theory 
first, then Ill get down to the real sauce 
behind all those Alfredos youve had 
foisted upon you over the years.
For those of you dedicated readers 
whove been clipping and saving, you 
may recall that way back when I gave 
you a recipe for Italian tomato spaghetti 
sauce, I specified that you must heat the 
olive oil, saut the onions until clear, 
then add the minced garlic and cook 
until golden.
Turns out I was more right than I 
knew.
This is the very heart and soul of half
spaghetti and pizza,
Sbarros Pizza and 
Dominos.
Even your averge, decent Italian 
Ristorante presents 
1 amalgamation of 
regional styles that 
would bewilder
Sophia Loren (recently named by the 
as by far the most beautiful 60- 
year-old in world history).
A well-meaning cook might well won
der where to turn for the facts. Well, 
allow Old Man Donner to tell you: 
Marcilla Hazan.
This wonderful woman has written a 
book called The Essentials of Italian 
Cooking that is to food from the Boot 
what 17 magazine is to teeny boppers.
...most food mutates during the long passage 
across the ocean to this country, and rarely do 
you find the true' taste of whatever nation 
you're trying this week.
of all Italian cuisine, and its vital that it 
be done this way.
Put in the onions before the oils hotand 
things get mushy; put the garlic in at the 
same time as the onions, and it cooks too 
much and overwhelms other flavors; 
press the garlic instead of mincing, and 
it gets bitter and pulpy.
Apparently this is the way much of 
Italian cooking is: subtle methods build
flavor from the bottom, and simply chuckWere talking the theory and practice of ing in more flavor at the end is about as 
real Italian cooking. satisfying as eating dough, then tomato
Now I realize that this is not necessar- sauce, then cheese, then pepperoni.
Oh, that reminds me: basil is actually 
supposed to be put in at the end, to keep 
it sweet.
I traditionally havent, but who am I to 
argue with centuries of tradition?
The Real Alfredo
8 oz. heavy whipping cream
4 Tb butter (1/2 stick)
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
Fettucine (enough for 3 or 4)
grated nutmeg (optional)
Put 2/3 of the cream and all the butter 
in a large saucepan, and melt on me
dium heat.
Cook the pasta (if youre ever going to 
get good pasta, do it for this recipe; dont 
be fooled, however, by Contadina and 
other refrigerated pastaspasta should 
be dried, not refrigerated), drain it, and 
put it in the saucepan, mixing it well.
Turn the heat on low and add the 
remaining cream and the cheese, mix
ing thoroughly (get decent grated cheese, 
so itll really melt); nows the time for 
just a pinch of nutmeg, if you can find it.
Serve this immediately with plenty of 
cheese at the table.
------------------------- Enjoy what
should be one of the 
best Alfredos youve 
ever had. Oh, and a 
word of warning: 
this dish does not 
reheat edibly. If you 
cant finish it, give 
------------------------ it away.
That does it for 
Real Italian this week.
Next week well be venturing to Mexico 
at the request of a foreign reader who 
has this column translated into his na
tive tongue by the village scribe.
This weeks t-shirt goes to John Doan, 
an exchange student in Switzerland.
Village scribe, indeed!
After enjoying the sites and. smells of 
Italy, Old Man Donner has set off in his 
mission to share his culinary wizardry 
with the rest of the world. Where will he 
end up next  one can only wonder.
Vagina defines women
By SUZANNE PADDOCK
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I wasnt sure what to expect from 
the Vagina Monologues. I was sur
prised by the number of people who 
attended the reading.
I was even more curious to see what 
Eve Ensler was going to be like. When 
she walked out on stage her presence 
was commanding. Her hair, her clothes 
suggested someone a bit different, 
bolder. Yet her voice was comforting 
and familiar.
I loved how she simulated the voice 
of every woman in each monologue. 
She transformed her presence mag
nificently to fit her characters.
I listened intently to each woman 
talk about her vagina vicariously 
through Eve. The stories were sad, 
funny, erotic, disturbing and warm
ing.
Eve interviewed various types of 
women for her monologues. One of 
them was a 70-year old woman with a 
heavy New York accent. She had been 
secretly battling with her vagina for 
many years.
On a particular date when she was a 
young woman, she became sexually 
aroused. Her vagina produced a flood 
which stained her dress and her dates 
car seat. She never forgave her vagina 
for that.
Another monologue was about a 
younger woman trying to get in touch 
with herself, literally. She had a diffi
cult time being comfortable looking at 
and feeling herself.
She came to realize her vagina was 
not a separate entity meant to be ig
nored. But rather it was her.
Prevalent throughout the piece was 
the idea that your vagina is not simply 
a part of you, but rather, it is you.
A strange concept at first but the 
more she read the more I believed this 
to be true.
Here were these women having ex
periences that profoundly affected 
their lives and these experiences were 
channeled through their vaginas.
The reaction people gave me when I 
told them I was going to the Vagina 
Monologues was amusing. Of course, 
with just the mention of the word 
vagina, everyone practically stops dead 
in their tracks.
Part of the discussion before and 
after Eve was about the taboo associ
ated with the word vagina.
When we left, my friends and I dis
cussed this very notion. We discussed 
how the concept of the word penis is 
prevalent in the public sphere but the 
word vagina is not.
We also realized that the extensive
ness of the concept of penis is so perva
sive that society even constructs build
ings that resembles them. As we said 
this, we walked past the Cathedral of 
Learning. We looked up at the build
ing and laughed.
I wish women were more in sync 
with their bodies. And not just in a 
sexual manner alone.
When you know who you are and 
what you are, you have more confi
dence in yourself. Women need to feel 
more comfortable about having a va
gina in order to feel more confident 
about being a woman.
Its hard being a woman. Physically 
you are constructed weaker. Socially 
you are programmed to be weaker. 
Often times I wonder what it would be 
like to be a man.
I assume it would be easier but I 
cant say for sure. I also wonder if 
women can ever fit into the patriar
chal lock of this world. I wonder if man 
was the only key perfectly fitted to 
turn it.
But when I see the things some 
women are doing, like Eve, I know 
there are other ways to embrace this 
world.
I just hope one day the world will be 
able to embrace us back.

In a laddergram, the object 
Is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
In the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

Andrew McDermott/Tartan Photographer 
Students mingle in the main hallway of CFA, 
during the Beaux Arts Ball.
Ball disappoints patrons
BEAUX, from page LI
The art displays that were supposed to be all 
over the building were in fact just spread out over 
the building. In Hewlett Gallery (on the first 
floor), there was the already installed Wedding 
Machine, created by Leah Crowley and Colin 
Piepgras. Between the Art Department and the 
Music Department (second floor), there was a 
room which had a very incriminating wall of slide 
projectors and hi-tech stereophonic equipment 
that was wired up for the purpose of slapping 
colorful rectangles of color on the wall opposite it. 
This, it seemed, was the room to return to over 
and over again, when the Ball got too-exciting to 
stand. Strangely enough, it was practically empty 
the whole evening. To its credit, the Wedding 
Machine display was a great statement on the 
way people bond in marriage, and the gender roles in society. Comprised of a large wedding cake in 
front of a full audience of folding lawn chairs, the piece made its strongest point with the centerpiece 
of the cake: A starched and molded bridal gown and bridegrooms tux side by side, with the backs cut 
out of both outfits for whatever Jane or John wishes to step up for holy matrimony. In reading a press 
release, we understand that the thing moves, adding a whole plethora of new meaning to the work. 
Oh, well, they didnt let it run that night. We 
understand that there was an interesting display 
slated to be shown at the entrance, a huge mush
room made out of multiple materials, the bulk of 
which was an improperly treated mass of blue 
foam. Unfortunately, the foam was highly flam
mable, so it was either get rid of it or shut the Ball 
down; consequently, we were robbed of a third of our 
art for the evening. Its a pity; a large flaming 
mushroom would have been quite the sight to see,
| and Im sure it would have generated a lot of positive 
feedback.
We did discover some trends in the costumes, and 
made up our list of the five most common ones:
5) Cross Dressing: Whether men as women or 
women as men, it remains a tried and true costume 
favorite.
4) Cleavage: Many women simply stuffed their busts into the tightest, shortest dress they had,
and called it a costume. We were disappointed 
in not finding those people that had no cos
tumes at all, but we figured that the cold 
weather had changed their agenda slightly.
3) Human Statues: God knows what they 
had painted themselves with, but there were 
some insane people tumbling up and down the 
second floor hallway, in wheelchairs, and in 
chains.
2) Dead Movie Stars: What costume party 
would be complete without them?
1) EMS Officers: Were not quite sure why 
this was such a popular costume, but for some 
reason we saw more of these than anything.
So, if you went to the Ball, just try and 
remember Milo Z, Frankenstein, and the WeddingMachine. Ifyou didnt, dont worry. Maybe 
theyll try again 97. We can only wait....

Writer explains Beaux Arts downfall
By JON SLENK
Tartan Staffwriter
Okay, no%v I want to tell you what a real Beaux 
Arts Ball should be all about. Beaux Arts Balls, 
as you might have cleverly deduced from the 
moniker, are generally put on by schools of fine 
art. RealBeaux Arts Balls canbefoundinFrance, 
which you also might have been able to hypoth
esize. Generally speaking, they are drunken fes
tivities celebrating exuberant creativity, artistic 
toil and human bonding.
Yes, I said drunken festivities. Schools of fine 
art in Paris, and elsewhere, throw these gala 
events as often as twice a year, and it just so 
happens that the dates they are thrown are 
generally staggered from school to school, pro
viding a series oftension releasing celebrations 
for students to look forward to. Admission is free 
for students of the host ecote, while everyone else 
has to pay the outrageous sum of six dollars 
(well, that depends on the current exchange rate, 
I guess) to be allowed into this most hallowed 
affair.
Alchohol is available to just about everyone. 
Europeans, on the whole, arent pathetiely neu
rotic protestants/who deny that people can actu
ally drink and not end up starting some kind of 
horrendous blood bath; that alchohol is a great
social lubricant; and that if people want to drink 
they most likely wil (do you recall the emer
gency station that was set up two Balls ago to 
handle those who would drink before the Ball 
since they knew none would be available there? 
Denial and oppression serve only to cause fur
ther problems!).
I think the only really useful thing to come out 
of CMU Beaux Arts Balls is the underscoring of 
American (let alone Pennsylvanian) pettyness, 
paranoia, and all around fascism.
X realize the university must abide (to a certain 
extent!) by State and Federal law, but I dont see 
why the organizers of the Ball, members of this 
supposedly top notch institution, cant learn a 
thing or two from Metropol, where you can go 
upstairs (if you are over 21 and have the proper 
ID) to obtain and quaff an alchoholic beverage of 
your choice. Insurance problems? Please.
So, to paraphrase a fellow journalist who at
tended the Ball, this was obviously an accident 
which found a nice, cozy campus on which to 
happen. Next time someone at CMU decides to 
promote such a gathering, I suggest that instead 
of trying to hold it here, they buy a huge block of 
cheap round trip tickets to Prance, where not 
only will we be able to experience the Keal Thing, 
we might happen to (gasp!) broaden our nasty, 
parochial meta-conscious.

John Carpenter fans, cover your 
eyes. The talented director who 
brought us Halloween, Prince of 
Darkness, and Starman now 
brings us In the Mouth of Mad
ness, a disjointed, poorly-acted 
horror flick that consistently 
misses its own point. Sam Neill 
(Jurassic Park, The Piano) plays 
an insurance investigator hired 
by a publishing company to help 
find missing best-selling author, 
Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). 
What he finds instead is Hobbs 
End, a fictitious town that is the 
subject of one of Canes 
bestsellers; the town has been 
brought to life by virtue of Canes 
writing.
The town comes complete with 
a husband-murdering 80-year-old 
woman, posessed and decaying 
children, slime-oozing monsters, 
and Cane himself, holding the
manuscript of his latest book, 
which is meant to drive the whole 
world insane.
Sounds like a pretty good plot, 
right? Thats what I thought, but 
it still never ceases to amaze me 
how many good ideas get made 
into terrible movies, especially 
with a director like John Carpen
ter and a lead like Sam Neill. 
Instead of focusing on the eerie 
atmosphere of Hobbs End and 
the potential of a single book to 
drive anyone who reads it insane, 
Carpenter resorts to a constant 
flood of cheap thrills, most of 
which fail to deliver a thrill.
While the special effects are 
quite impressive (at one point a 
woman contorts her body, amidst 
the cracking and popping ofbones, 
into a position that even Gumby 
would have trouble achieving), 
most of the effects are so outra
geously done that they just arent 
scary.
During the whole tedious or
deal, I silently kept praying that 
Carpenter would at least pull off 
a decent ending. I was, however, 
bitterly disappointed. I wont give 
the ending away, just in case you 
decide to go see it after all, but Ill 
say that I wish I had just left 
early. At least then I could have 
fooled myself into believing that 
the ending wasnt going to leave 
me feeling empty, disappointed, 
and basically pissed off that I had 
sat there for two hours when I 
could have been home watching 
The X-Files.
If my review is enough to keep 
you from wasting your money on 
Madness (or if you had no desire 
to see it in the first place), and 
you just cant think of anything 
else to do this weekend, go and 
rent Oliver Stones Natural Born 
Killers (just released on video): 
Its shocking, funny, violent, un
conventional and has an amaz
ing soundtrack  one of the defi
nite must-sees of the year.

Batman spinoff receives rave reviews
COMIC BOOK CHRONICLES
By Jason Andracki
You know, Ive never been fond of spinoffs, in 
comics or otherwise. Hello Larry paled in 
comparison to Different Strokes, and none of 
those silly mutant books can compare to the 
glory days of the Uncanny X-Men. However, 
once in a while Im surprised by a spinoff 
title. Azrael is one of those mags.
I read the Sword of Azrael mini-series, 
and although I didnt really see what all the 
hype was about (aside from the great art by 
Joe Quesada), it did do a good job laying the 
groundworkfor the infamous Knightfall, in 
which the man behind this version of Azrael, 
Jean Paul Valley, tried to take over as 
Batman, freaked out and got whipped by the 
one true Dark Knight. So what do we have 
now? A character that played a really impor
tant role in a major event and now is no
where. Now, finally Azrael returns in his 
own unlimited series (and a story in Show
case in the meantime). I must say I was 
skeptical at first. How is DC going to put out 
a book when the title character is a few eggs 
short of an omelet? Notice I said DC, not 
Vertigo, because that would be common
place there.
Lo and behold, all my skepticism is proven 
to be for naught with the first two issues of 
Azrael. Unless something really spectacular 
comes out, this has my vote for Best New 
Ongoing series in the 1995 Comic Book Buyers 
Guide Awards. The creative team for this book 
is writer Dennis ONeil (who wrote the Sword 
of Azrael miniseries, created Azrael along with
Quesada, and was editor of the Bat-books. 
Wow do I miss Dennys Den), and Barry 
Kitson and James Pascoe (both of whom 
most recently worked on Adventures of Su
perman) on pencils and inks, respectively. 
The book is a bit more expensive than the 
regular Bat-books, but the extra 45 cents is 
worth it for the full bleed artwork.
ONeil does an excellent job of telling a 
story and thankfully does do more 
storytellingthan scheduling mindless brawls 
on certaipi pages. He must also be comDC Comics, Inc.
TV spinoffs like Just the Ten of Us may not 
have succeeded, but Azrael does that and 
more.
mended on developing some supporting char
acters, which isnt done often enough, such 
as Brian, the homeless, drunk ex-psychia
trist, and those wacky followers of the Order 
of St. Dumas. Hopefully they will be sticking
around for a little longer. Probably my favor
ite moment of the first two issues was the 
guest appearance in issue #2 by Batman. I 
especially enjoyed Batmans reply to Valleys 
question of How? with Im a detective, 
since that was something Valley overlooked 
when wearing the cowl.
In addition to ONeils fine writing, the 
book is filled with finely detailed art of 
Kitson and Pascoe fresh from their run on 
Adventures of Superman. I thought it would 
be difficult to replace Joe Quesada and Kevin 
Nowlan, but these two are doing quite nicely. 
There is a lot of time put in by Kitson with 
the unique layout of the panels, plus some 
very exquisite borders on some pages. My 
only wish is that DC can keep ahold of 
Kitson and Pascoe so they dont move on to 
some Image drek. Also commendations 
should go out to Demetrias Bassoakos and 
Ken Bruzenak for the coloring and lettering. 
Details like this are often overlooked but 
these two have to be included since they 
make the book a beautiful package overall. 
Im not sure who to compliment for this, but 
I really like the Azrael logo and I hope it is 
kept at its current, smaller than usual size, 
so as to obstruct the cover art the least.
Azrael is definitely a spinoff that is worth 
picking up. I think in the future it will stand 
on its own and be a fine addition to the 
Batman family of books offered by DC. I 
suggest you pick up the first two issues fast 
because they have been selling out where I 
shop, so dont hesitate and be forced to pay 
high back-issue prices, even though it will be 
worth it.
Jason Andracki is a sophomore profes
sional writing major when hes not too busy 
reading comics. He has never dressed up like 
Batman or any other superhero, honestly!
When you see something that shouldnt be 
there, ignore it.

Larry and Carols serves up good pizza
THE PIZZA REVIEWS
By Jon Slenk and 
the Pizza Review Board
Place: Larrys & Carols Pizza 
Address: 410 Semple St 
Phone: 687-1189
This week, we put Larry & 
Carols pizza to our grueling, rig
orous, pain-staking, well-honed, 
gastronomic tests, for you, gentle 
reader. What lengths we go to, 
simply to ensure your good eat
ing. What sacrifice! What self
lessness! I should put in a com
ment about relative sizes of piz
zas. Different places call differ
ent sizes different things. These 
were pretty big.
The Pepperoni 
We were greeted with a yummy
sight upon opening the pepperoni 
box. The cheese was nicely 
melted, not browned, and the 
plentiful pepperoni slices looked 
just delish. Upon picking it up, 
we found the crust to be soft and 
pliable (good folding pizza, as 
one reviewer commented), al
though there was an inordinate 
amount of grease (mmm, grease!) 
seeping through the box itself.
We should bring special atten
tion to the sauce. It was thick 
(watery sauce sucks), full of to
mato and oregano flavor, and 
there was plenty of it (dry pizza 
sucks). Good deal.
The Special
We arent entirely sure what a 
Pizza Duo really is. We thought it 
was supposed to be something 
like two layers of crust, with sauce 
between and on top of them, and 
the toppings on top of all of that - 
a double decker pizza, if you will. 
While the pizza was very heavy, 
when we examined a cross sec
tion of a slice, we couldnt tell 
what was there. Everything just 
sort of oozed together. Anyway, it 
did seem like it was bigger and 
thicker.
This particular pie had fresh 
mushrooms on one half, and pep
peroni on the other. It was, unfor
tunately, cooked too long. The 
cheese was browned, which some 
of us really dont like, and the 
pepperoni was burned where it 
was exposed.
It seemed like the cheese and 
toppings were sliding down the 
slope of the crust towards the 
middle of the pie, forming a big 
ball of sauce, cheese, mushrooms 
and pepperoni.
One really needed a fork and 
knife (or lots of paper towels) to 
successfully tackle this beast. If 
you are looking for a big hunk of 
pizza, this is it.
The Numbers 
Crust: Pretty decent, not 
burned, good for folding. Low
score of 6, high of 7.5.
Sauce: We liked it! A flat score 
of 9 all round!
Cheese: Good when not 
browned. A low of 4, and a high of 
7.
Pepperoni: Again, good when 
not burned. A low of 4 and a high 
of 6.
Special Toppings: Whats on 
this thing? And it looks burned. 
Still, if you are super-duper hun
gry, it could be good. A low of 4 
and a high of 5.
The End
Okay, so the pepperoni was 
good. The special would have been 
much better had it not been over
cooked, but in its defense we must 
say that the mooshy middle was 
really quite good. If we sort of 
play around with the numbers, 
we get an average of something 
like 6. There ya go.

Beloved makes 
sooY 99nwx9
By DAWN WALLHAUSEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Movie: Immortal Beloved
Starring: Gary Oldman, Isabella Bosellini et.al.
I tried to resist. I tried to avoid comparing this movie to 
Amadeus, its cinematographic counterpart. Unfortunately, it 
was impossible. After all, both movies take place during roughly 
the same era, both are more-or-less biographical accounts of the 
lives of classical composers, and the music of each composer 
plays a prominent part in each film. Once I accepted that I would 
fail miserably in my attempts to thwart the obvious juxtaposi
tions, I went to the 
movies in peace. The 
comparisons between 
thetwoare what prob
ably saved me from 
being as unhappy with 
thisffickassomeother 
reviewers have been.
I thought, This can't 
possibly be as good as 
Amadeus,  and I was 
right, so I wasnt disappointed. Keith Hamshere
Forthoseofyouwho Gary Oldman plays the famous Ludwig 
dont know. Immortal von Beethoven in Immortal Beloved. 
Beloved is about the
life and loves of Ludwig von Bee-thoven. The story begins with 
Beethovens death, and is mostly one bigflashback. Ludwigs ex
secretary and friend, Herr Schindler, finds a copy of the departed 
composers will, in which everything is bequeathed to his im
mortal beloved. Unfortunately, the will neglects to mention 
exactly who that person is. In order to ensure that Beethovens 
dying wish is fulfilled, Schindler sets out to find the mystery 
woman.
Dont worry, I wont spoil the ending of the movie. Suffice it to 
say that I dont think it was worth the $6.25. Its not that 
Immortal Beloved was terrible. I do recommend seeing it during 
the matinee. Or, see it when it comes outon video. Ijustwouldnt 
advise paying full evening prices for it. Gary Oldman did give a 
rather spectacular performance, but unfortunately the role gave 
Oldman less of a chance to display his talents than one would 
hope. This film was more about Beethovens lovers than himself. 
Also, I didnt see enough of the woman who was Beethovens true 
love until the end of the film. Isabella Rosellmis character was 
responsible for relating most of the story to Schindler, but she 
knew little and told little of the woman who came between her 
and Ludwig. Rosellinis performance was exquisite, dont get me 
wrong. It was the writing which made me lack total sympathy for 
the immortal belovedVThe real problem lies in that someone, 
somewhere along the line, got carried away. They began giving 
too much information. The better part of the last sequence could 
have been removed from the film, and it would have left me 
feeling less spoon-fed and much happier.
Ingeneral, thefilm lacked the depthand complexity of Amadeus. 
While individual performances shined, things began to fall apart 
as the movie came together. For the most part, there is no 
comparison. The music, however, was beautiftil. It was expertly 
performed, and was  surprisingly  integrated into the film 
even better than Mozarts music in Amadeus. In fact, the scenes 
which coupled Beethovens music with some of his life oceurances 
were among the best in the movie. Those were the scenes where 
I felt most empathetic towards the maincharaeter. Those are the 
parts xvhere I knew the man behind the artist.
To sum it all up, Immortal Beloved has some talented perform
ers who breathe life into it. The script is weak in general, with 
some strong areas which are fortified by great music. Dont go 
expecting it to be another Amadeus, and you might enjoy it 
despite all its faults.

This movie has no plot. Its a bunch of moving 
pictures with nature-related themes with a 
soundtrack by a hep-cat named Phillip Glass. Its 
artsy and its beautifully done.
Although you wont have edge-of-your-seat drama 
or lip-curling excitement, youll get plenty of won
derful cinematography and some nice alternativetype music. This isnt a Stallone vehicle, so you can 
see this in good conscience.

Bullets Over Broadway
Woody Allen makes lots of movies. He likes to 
make movies about fanny things and he enjoys 
making movies, youd assume. He has a funny 
name. He made Annie Hall, which was real good. He 
also made one about sex with sheep, but we dont 
like to talk about that one.
This movie is about John Cusack as a playwright 
who is backed by a mob boss. However, young 
Cusack has to give the boss best girl, Jennifer Tilly, 
a part. And to make sure he does, the mob boss hires 
a hitman to keep an eye on things and do some 
rewrites. Manhattan Murder Mystery was real good, 
too, and I think this one is pretty good, too. Woody 
Allen is funny.
Lets recap: Woody Allen makes funny movies. 
This is a movie about funny things, especially a 
funny playwright and a funny girl. Its Allen, its 
mob bosses, its delightful. Enjoy.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

The Specialist
Sylvester Stallone is still making movies. Still! 
Think about it. People still want to see him doing 
things on screen. Thats a pretty sad state of affairs, 
children of a lesser god. Anyway, The Specialist 
stars Stallone as a hit man. Now theres a stretch.
This movie also stars Sharon Stone, who probably 
shows some skin, and James Woods as Stallones 
little buddy. What happens, see, is that Stone hires 
Stallone to kill some Cuban drug lords. Stallone 
says no, so Stone goes and boinks the drug lords son 
or something. Then Stallone has to save her and 
blow things up. Finally, they have steamy sex and 
everything is just a-ok.
The Specialist is a... fun movie. For a good time, its 
ok, but its no Annie Hall. I guess you can see, if you 
want.
At 6, 8:10,10:20 pm, and 12:30 am.

Assault on Precinct 13
This was made in 1976 and was directed by John 
Carpenter. It stars a bunch of delinquient youths 
who take over a Los Angeles police station and shoot 
the place up and generally act pretty scary. It seems 
like a very good movie, though, so try not to miss it.
I think there used to be a show about guys who did 
things with computers, from around 1976, but I 
doubt it. It probably was from about 1983 or some
thing. I think it was called the Whiz Kids. And 
then there was this one show about a genius detec
tive guy and this one girl who painted himself blue 
once and made a castle in his head. I forget what 
that show was called, though. Anyway, see Assault 
on Precinct 13.

The wicked step-sisters,

piece orchestra directed by 
Jeff Kunins, a senior IDS 
major, who also wrote the music 
for last years Spring Carnival 
production, Nemeses.
The Scotch N Soda production 
is completely student-run, di
rected by junior 
directing major,
Matt Morrow.
According Mor
row, who also directedTVemeses, 
between 7580 
students tried 
out for this 
show. This is a
stage is cleverly constructed and 
becomes part of a special effect 
later on in the show. The 
proscenium in Act One falls for
ward to the ground during Act 
Two to make a thrust stage, cre^ 
ating a very dramatic effect. Mor^ 
row explains that it symbolizes a 
change in the characters, allow-, 
ing the audience to get a better 
view into the characters. The 
elevated seating gives the audi
ence a better view of the stage, 
and having only 110 seats, it cre
ates a more intimate atmosphere.
The greatest challenge has 
been doing a show in this room 
(Drill Deck), and finding re
hearsal space, said Morrow. For 
this production, Scotch N Soda 
has been rehearsing in Porter 
Hall classrooms, and in small 
rooms in the Student Center; 
having to move out desks and 
tape down stage markings each, 
time they rehearse. As bad as 
Skibo was, at least there was 
adequate rehearsal and perfor-I 
mance space there.
Scotch N Soda has worked, 
through a lot of obstacles to p.ut 
this show together. With limited 
financial resources and facilities,.

Szechuan House makes good off-campus dining
ANCIENT CHINESE 
SECRETS
By Ido Ben-Shachar 
and Aaron Weisberg
This week, in addition to going 
to our restaurant of the week, we 
also had the opportunity to visit 
the on-campus Chinese establish
ment, Student Center Wok.
Although they now take DineXpress, the food is still the same. 
We ordered General Tsos chicken 
(go figure), and it was soggy. What 
do we mean when we say soggy? 
We mean that instead of having 
the lightly-seasoned crispy bread
ing that we normally expect from 
General Tsos, the chicken had a 
heavily greased soggy film sur
rounding it. Needless to say, we 
were not thrilled.
However, we think that the 
problem with Student Center 
Wok is not necessarily one of 
food quality, but rather a mar
keting problem. The new name 
just isnt catchy enough, and per
haps hundreds, maybe even thou
sands of Carnegie Mellon stu
dents just dont KNO W about the 
terrible food they can get on cam
pus.
Conveniently, we have come up 
with a list of our top ten sug
gested names:
10) Au Bon Wok 
9) Eat W Wok 
8) Dont Wok
7) Side Wok 
6) Wendell Wok 
5) International House of 
Wok
4) President Mehrabians 
Chicken
3) Sum Dum Wok 
2) Why Wok?
1) The establishment 
formerly known as Wean Wok
We believe that with one of the 
suggested names above, Student 
Center Wok could flourish as a 
focal point of the campus commu
nity. On the other hand, it could 
die a horrible death.
Our main intake of Chinese 
food this week was at a fabulous 
restaurant in Squirrel Hill known 
as Szechuan House (1900 Murray 
Avenue, Squirrel Hill, 422-2700). 
Luckily, we arrived at about 5:55 
pm, and were thus able to order 
from the early-bird specials, 
which are only $7.50. The menu 
was also filled with dishes for the 
Chinese New Year, but they were 
slightly more expensive.
One of the most important 
things we look for in a Chinese 
restaurant is the presentation; 
Both the food and the surround
ings must be beautiful. Some 
restaurants we have visited go to 
great lengths to make sure each 
dish is a masterpiece of artwork, 
with garnishes and a blend of 
vegetables simply to give color. 
Other restaurants spend their 
efforts in decorating the estab
lishment with authentic Chinese 
art and beautifully folded nap
kins.
Of course, both of these aspects 
are important to us.
Szechuan House stressed the
first of these requirements, pre
senting colorful dishes that not 
only could be appreciated for their 
taste, but also for their appear
ance. One method utilized to 
make the food seem shiny and 
glistening is the heavy use of com 
starch. Szechuan House, espe
cially in their stir-fried veg
etables, uses com starch to pro
duce this effect.
The decorations in Szechuan 
House are also very commend
able, but unfortunately they do 
not seem authentic to us. One of 
the decorations was in fact a 
shiny, reflective thingy, which 
reminded us a lot of Lite-Brite.
Now, back to the food. After 
placing our order, we were quite 
pleased at the promptness of the 
service. Our tea was scalding hot 
(as we like it), and was always 
quickly replenished. The soup 
also arrived immediately, and 
although the wontons were a little 
heavy on the won, they had just 
the right amount of ton (we have 
no clue what this actually means). 
In any case, our waitress was 
kind enough to give us crispy 
noodles, and we were happy.
The General Tsos was deli
cious. Needless to say, it topped 
the General Tsos from Student 
Center Wok. It had an orangy 
taste to it, and as our good friend 
Jeff put it, it was a little heavy 
on the ginger. We enjoyed it, 
though, and recommend it as a 
dish to try.
Our sweet and sour chicken 
was rather bland, and seemed to 
be the generic, run of the mill 
chicken nuggets, with a simple 
duck sauce. We were not im
pressed.
The house special beef had a 
tangy flavor, but was served luke
warm. Actually, if you like beef, 
Szechuan House has a unique 
style which makes the beef not 
seem so heavy. Perhaps they use 
leaner beef, or maybe theyre just 
really good with tofu, but what
ever it is, it always turns out 
quite tasty.
We also ordered Hunan Tri, 
which is a combination of veg
etables, chicken, beef, and 
shrimp. We were disappointed 
that the sauce used for the Hunaii 
Trio was identical to that of th 
house special beef. We at least 
expected some variety in th 
preparation of dishes .The chicken 
with cashews was surprisingly 
good, even though we dont lik 
cashews in Chinese food very 
much. It was a delicious blend of 
chicken and mostly snow peas. !
All in all, Szechuan House was 
worth the price we paid. $7.50 is 
a great deal, especially with th 
outstanding service we received. 
Being so close to campus, w 
would recommend that anyon 
interested in Chinese food giv 
1 Szechuan House a try. We giv 
them out of five Gen
eral Tsos Chicken chunks.
Remember, send in your es
says to win free Chinese food as 
soon as possible! Just tell us why 
you think you should win, and 
either send them to Ancient Chi
nese Secrets c/o The Tartan (Cam
pus Mail, Box #17), or send email 
to aw43@andrew.cmu.edu.
Fortune of the week: Ideas are 
like children: there are none so 
wonderful as your own.
So where are we going next 
week? Ancient Chinese secret!

It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to 
love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has 
been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work 
for which all other work is merely preparation. That is why young 
people, who are beginners in everything, are not yet capable of love: it is 
something they must learn. With their whole being, with all their forces, 
gathered around their solitary, anxious, upward-beating heart, they must 
learn to love.

I wish that I had. 
Against the azure that is the vast dome

always waiting

As I break free, he is no longer mine.
He can't even see me from where he stands;
He wants to hold on,

Topaz is for Love
by Troy Benowitz
Past West Indian markets,
boarded-up synagogues,
and seas of Whopper wrappers I find
myself locked in a twelve-by-lwelve 
studio with my mother 
and Doris and Elton John
glaring at me through Statue of Liberty goggles 
from inside a perfect pink frame.
Eltons the only thing
I have anymore,
she says, over a Natural Light,
sex with Doris isnt even that great,
she whispers, though Doris 
is protecting high schoolers 
from guns and drugs
on the Lower West Side this afternoon.
She has sent Elton a teddy bear 
for Christmas with a piece of topaz
in its paw. Topaz is for love, 
and we love Elton."
They go without food
to buy Elton gifts,
which would be fine,
or at least socially acceptable
if it were Jesus,
Society just doesnt have its priorities straight, 
she insists.
Yet to keep with tradition
we go to the Christmas Eve service
at the church of the former great
Norman Vincent Peale, Moms 
eyes glued to Donald Trump 
just trying to get closer to the Lord
in his own reserved pew 
in the balcony overlooking 
the congregation.
My Mother doesnt love Trump, 
surely, like she loves Elton, 
but as the preacher advises us
on how to handle those who cuss 
on the subway, her eyes glow, 
excited to be in the presence of Donald,
Maybe hell see me,"
she thinks for a minute,
as her thoughts return to Elton,
and she whispers,
If Jesus loves us,
Elton will write back before New Years.
Before I can reply,
were caught up in Silent Night,
and even as I glance up at Donald,
jealous, maybe, but angry,
angry like I was at those Born-Again,
and Elton, and my Mother,
and myself, for knowing 
whats right,
truly, and doing somehow 
the opposite.

to the sweat of her hand.
fading into the still 
silence of morning brilliance 
and whispering over 
the dank, sweet 
smell of overripe fruit.

Love song
(for a boy I used to see around)
Lets shed our pretensions, please?
Ill bathe you in my humble honesty 
and accept your ernest scrubbing in
we'll sink neck-high into some 
ill-lit pool
(soothing ridiculous) as we splash 
each other with our raw
words, and in our 
nakedness,
we may find we are friends.

she was here again, last night
just as real, as this quilt or the birds
singing on the sill.
'
Its been weeks since I've seen her 
but she haunts me day by night.
Not an hour comes without her
nor does a day pass without me wanting
to see my reflection in j mjss foer
we spent our brief time casting superficial conversations, 
you know, the weather, food stupid stuff 
me - trapped like a doe, gazing through dreamy eyes 
while she, either never noticed or politely kept me at bay 
either way, i fell hard.
Koolc line and sinlcer
i'd be alright if I could only forget 
the laughs - the tears 
tears that made my heart both 
grieve and love at once.
friendships always come loo easy 
but shyness, ray handicap, my crutch 
has aluiays kept it just that, a friendship 
i'ue lost friends and louers because of it 
again jnd again and apn-c -n:
but now...i can only remember
wallowing in an elder pain, that only time can heal
waking to wispers
constantly idle, constantly
reaming

So it is tonight 
that is my dull epiphany, 
this cold night 
is my
souvenir. A beer, 
a long talk, a kiss, two kisses, five, 
remnants, really, or regrets
lou were only one building 
away, but I never called.
It took me too long
to notice that we were
the same blossom, starving 
in a field of weeds.
and tomorrow you will leave behind 
a trail of petals and potential 
and I will hate myself 
for only offering
you a Sam Adams 
and a wish 
for good luck.Everyone has that supernatural 
friend, the one who dreamed
your dream last night, whose 
sentences you steal, the one 
who is you in the flashing glass 
of a passing car.
you could have been it, we 
could have been the ghosts 
of each other, could have proved 
Harry and Sally wrong.
but I was looking for sex 
at the time. I saw you 
as thighs and firm breasts and wanted 
your porcelain hand 
smoothing my hair 
while I slept and dreamed 
my own dreams.

Between acts of Romeo and Juliet, you led me away
from the wine, beer, and pot of a Dallas Shakespeare festival.
Your lipstick on my cheek and your coy smile
promised more than the aromas around us,
but my vocabulary became pubescent hands fumbling
for the proper angle to unhook, unbutton, or understand.

After four months, *
I reluctantly became the James Dean 
you longed for: concave cheeks, 
always inhaling, a rebels jean jacket, 
and an impish smile.
You believed in the fantasy,
called me Romeo, and dreamed
of the night when we would
etch out Eves forbidden fruit
and finish a pack of cigarettes in satisfaction.
I called you Juliet, and needed
you like cocaine.
After the night in our own Eden 
you campared the gymnastic 
somersaults of Deans Porsche to my live.
I sobered up long enough to listen, 
but failed to see the metaphor.
I looked into your eyes
saw only tears, and turned away.

The next day, I called, 
listening to another sermon, 
and retreated 250 miles 
with a vision of the birthmark 
under your left nipple easing the nicotine fits 
of a six-hour bus trip.

VIGNETTE
by Jim Cockerille
Long hair, T-shirt, flannel overtop in a 
dress jacket mockery - Tartan tails are the 
uniform at Luna. Fifty cent drafts, two 
dollar pitchers - Michael Sheas and J.J. 
Wainwrights. Not a bad deal.
The space has dark character, a lone pool 
table and weve got front row seats.
The perceived differences between people 
at CMU and the crowd from Pitt is so 
clear, so distinct now, even under the 
milky lamplight - beyond prejudice, past 
preconception and most underwhelmingly 
refreshing.
The mood is different, too, and we cant 
leave it just yet; theyre too many observa
tions to make, too many conclusions to 
draw and a few more moments of smoky 
freedom atop a gravel of sound.
Well share another clove and some talk 
about this. Though separated in spirit, their 
joy gives us hope, a model to follow, a 
loaded example for brown bag carry out.

^ Time to kill,
as a kid.
Walking back from Maya, today, sparked 
a few records. I headed towards the southend of the Birmingham Bridge, arching 
surf green above the corrugated yellow of 
a school bus parking lot and climbing the 
pedestrian stairwell, I looked back on 
bored days of kicking stones and counting 
sidewalk cracks. I could hear the cars wizzing by and see the countless apartment 
buildings of my enormous world, Fairfax 
County.
Time was more flexible then, trimmed 
only by hunger and the food to please was 
less pretentious, less complicated - 
borrowed bouillon cube for a forty 
minute walk or slice of gummy white 
bread for ten minutes less. If I had really 
wandered far, I might break the journey in 
two at Jourgons Hardware Store with a 
stolen cup of hot chocolate from the back 
with a quarters worth of peanuts from the 
the dusty gumball machine up front. 
Warming up, I might look at buckets of 
nails - ones that might walk, ones put in 
our tree fort built from construction site 
lumber.

As the spark in your eyes, never to cease 
Though we were haunted by restraint back then 
I hope some day we will be more than friends.

that til6^were drawn to me. I was surprised. Usually I didn't mind too much.
And 1 never lasted past five or six months. I got bored.
I guess I've always been that way, though. Perhaps that's also why I didn't have close 
friends. I just kind of drifted around because I got bored so easily. The only time I wasn't 
bored was when I didn't know someone. So I would want to get to know them and once I 
did, well, I was bored again. Once my horoscope said to be careful because what I wish for I
My friends thought I was so:

me with their problems and I 
gave them advice. What a 
bunch of fucks. If they only 
knew who I really was. They 
didn't of course. They only 
knew that I was the one, and 
that I was very open, and that I 
worried too much. What they 
didn't know was that I was not 
actually giving them truly good 
advice, but it worked for them 
because their sheltered, subur
ban silly lives were so full of 
shit that one more trip to the 
bathroom wouldn't matter.
They also don't know that even though I liked being the one and I took 
advantage of it little by little, I would suffer myself afterwards, like some kind of personalgod Inflicted remorse. Even if I had been steadily going out with one of them for a while,ili

and pay for It. Most people probably would not consider anything I did "sinful." Not even 
my partners. But when I got home, I would sit in front of my magnified mirror, put on a 
headband, and destroy my face. I would look for things to pick at. If I was not satisfied, I 
would move to my chest, my back, the ingrown hairs on my legs from the Epilady. I
