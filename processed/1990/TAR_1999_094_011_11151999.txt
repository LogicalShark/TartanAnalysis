One week ago, in his fact finding 
report in the governments anti-trust 
case against Microsoft, Judge Thomas 
Jackson came to the conclusion that the 
corporation is a monopoly.
Many have deemed Microsoft to be a 
Robber Baron that strips consumers 
of lower prices, while other feel the 
Thomass decision was unfounded. On 
CMUs campus, there have been a vari
ety of opinions among professors as 
well as students.
I saw it coming. It was plausible, 
said senior Marcin Krieger, a computer 
science and philosophy double major.
However, Krieger himself personally 
does not believe that Microsoft is 
a monopoly.
According to US News and World 
report (1/11/99), no court has ruled that 
Microsoft is not a monopoly and it is far 
from being; proven that it is actually a 
monopoly. The results of this case are 
totally up in the air. It can go so many 
ways, said Krieger.
The government hopes that by break
ing down Microsoft, opportunities for 
smaller companies will rise. According 
to professor Seth Goldstein, one will 
never know what other companies 
could have offered to the computing 
industry. However, Goldstein believes 
that this ruling protects the business
but not the consumers. He agrees with 
the fact that Microsoft is a monopoly; 
however, according to him, it does not 
mean that the company should be bro
ken up. Goldstein made a deal earlier 
this semester to purchase 300 copies 
of Microsoft Visual Studio for his 
15-211 class.
The judge also ruled that Microsoft is 
a threat because it forces consumers to 
buy their products. I disagree with the 
judge finding that Microsoft is a coercful monopoly. They have not used force 
and fiend to gain their position; it by 
consumer choice, said Jason Crawford, 
senior economics major and president 
of the Objectivist Club, which .recently

Should CMUs software engineering 
department offer a major in ballistic 
missile engineering? Vincent Eirene, a 
long-time activist against CMUs 
Software Engineering Institute (SEI), 
might say that such a major would be 
fitting with the departments opera
tions, and this was the subject of a 
small protest he organized outside of 
the SEI building last Friday. The 
protest was in conjunction with a pre
sentation made by Nobel Prize nomi
nee Philip Berrigan on the subjects of 
activism and protests in general. 
There were about 10-15 protesters, in 
addition to police and media reporters.
The SEI makes sure all the air force 
bases are interfaced with five other 
military bases throughout the world, 
including the Bl-B bomber, voice
recognition, the new version of Star 
Wars [an alleged initiative to 
establish military installations in 
orbit around Earth], and on and on, 
Eirene said.
Vice President for University 
Relations Don Hale denied any 
involvement on the part of the SEI in 
any initiatives to engineer weapons 
systems. When asked if SEI creates or 
collaborates in the creation of any 
weapons software, Hale answered No. 
But Vince [Eirene] is free to express 
his point of view and has been for 
many years. He has a working rela
tionship with Campus Police and noti
fies them when he plans a protest, so 
the police are there to make sure he is 
treated fairly and given a chance to 
express his point of view.
Eirene has been demonstrating in 
and around CMUs campus for several

Housing Services and 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) are planning a new 
$1.9 million addition for 
Hamerschlag House, to be com
pleted over next summer.
The primary purpose of this 
project is to provide the Hill 
area of campus with a meeting
place of its own. Currently, 
Donner is the closest place for 
residents on the Hill to gather. 
According to Tim Michael, 
director of Housing Services, 
this will become the living room 
for the Hill. It will be under the 
two wings of Hamerschlag, and 
the two stories in the middle. 
We will eliminate the side 
entrance, and move the dump
ster. The [new] entrance will be 
under the wing, and there will 
be an interior street parallel to
the outside street. The new 
addition will include small 
group meeting spaces and a 
large warming kitchen. It 
will also make the first floor 
of Hamerschlag accessible. 
There will also be room for 
a Student Life Office so stu
dents wont have to walk all the 
way to Morewood.
Everyone on the Hill will 
benefit from the new addition
including the new exercise 
room and study areas, said 
Alex Meyers, a sophomore 
chemical engineering major 
and the Housing and Student 
Life Chair of SDC.
I dont know what else the 
school would do with the 2 mil
lion. Why not spend it here? 
Security in general is pretty good, 
just not in the rec room. Stuff is 
basically forsaken when its put 
in there, said Sebastian Habr, a 
first-year Hamerschlag resident.
This addition will also increase 
security on the Hill. According to 
Michael, there will be a security 
desk, and possibly security cam
eras with monitors at the desk.
Basically, theres always 
been a problem with security. 
There were pool balls stolen 
earlier in the year and lots of 
vandalism. We just got a whole 
new set of pool balls and cues 
and one of the cues was broken. 
It went downhill very quickly. 
The hope is that if there is 
checkout like most places, it 
will be less vulnerable, said 
Kenneth Berger, a first-year 
student in Hamerschlag.
Senior mechanical engineer
ing major Earl Crane, presi
dent of SDC, said he sees the 
new addition as a way to give 
more opportunities to the 
entire Hill community.
Housing and SDC have had 
an incredible relationship this 
year. Weve had excellent com
munication in coordinating 
this plan, said Crane. 
Housing has offered to put 
$2,000 toward a new air hock
ey table, and SDC will pay the 
remainder of the bill. SDC and 
Housing are working to con
vert the Margaret Morrison 
storefront into a recreation 
room or another gathering 
place for students. No con
crete plans have yet been 
made for this project.
Theres nothing happening on 
the hill right now, said Saied 
Hedayati, a first-year resident 
of Hamerschlag. The addition 
will be nice because people will 
have more reason to hang out 
around Schlag.

Last Thursday evening on the 
31st floor of the Regional 
Enterprise Tower building 
downtown, a panel discussion 
was held to discuss the pros and 
cons of Tax Increment Fundings 
(TIFs) as they are being used 
in Pittsburgh.
TIFs are one strategy used 
by governments of all levels 
to attract businesses and 
renovate torn-down neighbor
hoods. Forty-six states have now 
authorized the use of TIFs to 
partially fund projects.
The method might be used, for 
example, in a run-down suburb 
where a district has a projected 
-tax revenue for the next five 
years. A new corporation might 
then come into that district and 
start paying school property 
taxes, income taxes, and other 
business-related taxes. The dif
ference between the expected 
tax revenues in the district with 
the business and without the 
business is the basis for TIFs. 
The city then takes this differ
ence and creates bonds equal to 
that amount and sells them.to 
raise money to help finance a 
new project.
The Lazarus Department 
Store, the Pittsburgh
Technology Center, the new 
Giant Eagle Distribution
Center, the ALCOA building, 
and a few other projects down
town have been all financed 
through TIFs.
David Miller, associate dean of 
the Graduate School of Public 
and International Affairs at the
University of Pittsburgh, start
ed off the afternoon presenting 
each of the panelists. Donald 
Smith, Jr., executive director for 
the Center for Economic 
Development at the Heinz 
School of Public Policy and 
Management, played the role of 
economist. He introduced TIFs 
as a policy by which govern
ments increase their tax rev
enues. The pros, said Smith, are
Stephen Leeper, executive 
director of the Sports and 
Exhibition Authority of 
Pittsburgh and Allegheny 
County, argued the govern
ments vantage point on the use 
of TIFs. We recommend specific 
projects with companies who 
guarantee to pay a minimal 
amount regardless of whether or 
not the TIF is beneficial. In this 
way, Leeper said, the burden of
NigItuele pueobeeIp ldI 94,e igp o,ge ,h viH ago4IwIgl Gbgpug6 ug 
p,gl,g Nulleyb46d tiel vdb4epic2
that TIFs dont come out of cur
rent government revenues 
because bonds are created based 
on the expected increase in tax 
revenues generated by the new 
project. A downfall of TIFs is 
that they forgo increased tax 
revenues that would normally 
accrue through unassisted 
development. Also the TIF relies 
heavily upon projections.
Currently, the biggest debate 
on TIFs is not whether or not to 
use them, but rather when to 
use them.
a bad projection does not fall on 
the citizens; rather, most of the 
burden falls on the company. 
The combination of entertain
ment, shopping, and things to 
do are what makes a city great. 
Pittsburgh is the only city with 
four major stand-alone retail 
stores. Leeper also said that 
using TIFs for retail is good 
because it makes people want to 
live in the city, and people living 
in the city ultimately makes the 
city more profitable. Also,

PITTSBURGH (AP)Things certainly 
could have gone better for D.J. Dinkins 
during his senior season at Pitt. He lost 
his starting free safety job and missed a 
game with a hamstring injury.
Yet it was Dinkins  a Schenley High 
School graduate who grew up not far from 
the Pitt campus  who gave the 
Panthers a speech before their game yes
terday against Notre Dame.
I told them that we could finally go out 
and win a game and not come up short 
this time, Dinkins said. I told them we 
could go out and play above and beyond 
what we had been playing, with all the 
great players out there that I loved, grow
ing up, who came back to this last game 
at Pitt Stadium. We could go out with a 
bang and feel like champions.
And thats just what Pitt did.
The Panthers (5-5) put Pitt Stadium to 
bed with a rousing 37-27 victory over 
Notre Dame (5-5) yesterday in front of 
60,190 fans.
D.J.s speech did help us out a lot, said 
Panthers junior quarterback John Turman, 
who shook off his rusty performance of a 
week ago and completed 10 of 27 passes for 
231 yards and two touchdowns.
Notre Dame tied it twice, at 10-10 and 
17-17, and kept coming back, but Pitt 
held off the Fighting Irish with a bal
anced offense, a few big plays on defense 
and special team play.
And maybe with a little help from the 
boisterous crowd  which at games end 
brought down the goal posts and tore 
out pieces of the artificial turf field  
and the attendance of more than 400 
football lettermen.
It was a pressure-packed and emotion
ally charged game, Pitt Coach Walt 
Harris said. The fans were there from 
the start. I just wish we didnt have to 
tear our stadium down to get them to 
come to the game. I dont know what
were going to do for an encore.
We know weve disappointed people at 
times, but the fans make a difference. 
It was a big-time victory for us. We 
couldnt do anything else but win. Our 
guys would not be denied. Our fans would 
not be denied.
And all those stars from Pitt Stadiums 
previous 73 years? Harris said they made 
a difference, too.
We had so many lettermen here who 
had been on so many great football 
teams, Harris said.
So many great football players came 
back  Tony Dorsett, Marshall Goldberg, 
Bill Fralic, right on down the line. You talk 
about pressure. Youve got to step up to the 
plate with all those guys sitting in the 
stands evaluating you and expecting you 
to send the stadium out on the right note. 
Pitt Stadium will be torn down begin
ning next month to make way for a con
vocation center, student housing, and 
green space.
For the old bowls finale, the Panthers 
ended Notre Dames eight-game winning 
streak in the series.
The Irish tied it, 10-10, when quarter
back Jarious Jackson hit receiver Joey 
Getherall as he cut across the end zone 
for a 5-yard touchdown pass.
It looked like Notre Dame would take 
a lead into halftime. Linebacker Anthony 
Denman intercepted a Turman pass, 
and the Irish drove to Pitts 19. But 
Panthers freshman linebacker Scott 
McCurley blocked Sansons 36-yard 
field goal attempt.
I think that was huge, Harris said. It 
was an emotional switch. It went from 
them going ahead to us having the The 
Pitt Stadium era was over, but the 
Panthers felt like they might have found 
a new beginning.
It just wont be in Pitt Stadium 
anymore.

(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H./The 
Dartmouth  Although no charges 
have been filed by the Hanover 
Police in the incident involving an 
anti-Semitic threat written on the 
door of a Topliff undergraduate 
advisor, Safety and Security evicted 
Topliff Hall resident Peter Cataldo 
from his first-floor single 
Wednesday evening.
Charles Gussow  who originally 
reported the appearance of antiSemitic slurs on his message 
board to Safety and Security on 
Tuesday  said officers from that 
department arrived at approximate
ly 7:30 pm Wednesday evening to 
evict Cataldo.
On Wednesday morning, the 
threat KKK, Kill Kosher Kykes 
was written with a dry-erase mark
er on Gussows message board.
Gussow, who lives two doors 
away from Cataldo, said on 
Wednesday evening, shortly before 
the eviction, that Cataldo entered 
his room and said to him, I hate the 
Jews, and promptly left. Cataldo 
served as the president of the Class 
of 2000 during his freshman year at 
Dartmouth.
When contacted by The 
Dartmouth last night, Cataldo, who 
is currently residing in the 
Hanover Inn, did not admit or 
deny writing the threat on Gussows 
message board, saying only, Praise 
Jesus Christ, the only son of the 
only God.
Although Safety and Security 
would only say that they were con
tinuing their investigation yester
day, Gussow said officers issued 
their eviction on the grounds of a 
series of complaints from Tbpliff res
idents, including Gussow.
Hanover Police Chief Nick 
Giaccone said yesterday his depart
ment is fairly certain we know who 
the individual is right now but
would not comment on the status of 
a possible arrest.
On Tuesday, Gussow found the 
phrase Hitler was a great man 
written on his board and on 
Saturday, Oct. 30, two Topliff resi
dents discovered the slur Jews 
Suck on the same board.

time working against them, rescue 
workers battled bitter cold Sunday 
as they searched through concrete 
slabs and other debris in hopes of 
finding more survivors from 
Fridays devastating earthquake.
So far, 374 people are known to 
have died in the tremor, and anoth
er 3,000 are injured.
With the mercury plunging as 
low as 23 degrees overnight, the cold 
was also worsening the 
plight of those who lived through 
the disaster.
Local television reported that sur
vivors were having difficulty sleep
ing even with three or four blankets. 
There were not enough emergency 
tents to go around, and many people 
slept outside.
With the cold people give up more 
easily. They do not fight to stay 
alive, said French Army Capt. Jean 
Marc Castagnet, working with his 
team in the hard-hit town of 
Kaynasli, where rescuers dug out at 
least 135 bodies.
Castagnet and his colleagues also 
came to provide support following 
the massive earthquake that hit a 
nearby region of Turkey on Aug. 17, 
leaving more than 17,000 dead. 
After that quake, the survivors were 
struggling with sweltering heat

Governor Jeb Bush issued an execu

first steps in eliminating racial pref
erence in college admissions.
Bushs One Florida Initiative 
also includes programs designed 
to bolster Floridas K-12 education 
system and increase the number 
of minorities enrolled at public 
universities.
We can increase opportunity and 
diversity in the states universities 
and in state contracting without 
using policies that discriminate or 
that pit one racial group against 
another, Bush said Tuesday.
The plan calls for the elimination 
of race as a factor in admissions 
decisions. Race is one of many fac
tors currently used in alternative 
admissions in the State University 
System. Other factors include ath
letic ability, income level and geo
graphical location.
Last year, 11 percent of the incom
ing class was alternatively admitted 
to SUS institutions.
By continuing to use those other 
factors and not race, Bush said 
diversity can be achieved. He also 
called for an additional $20 million 
in need-based scholarship aid.
The initiative comes as California

PITTSBURGH (AP)
Developers and industries that 
want to fill in or drain wetlands 
almost always get the green 
light from the federal agency 
charged with protecting these 
natural resources  the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers.
Wetlands are valuable natur
al sponges for flood waters, fil
ters for pollutants, and habitats 
for wildlife, but the Corps 
Pittsburgh District hasnt 
denied a permit to develop a 
wetland of any consequence 
since the late 1970s. And that 
was in West Virginia.
The problem isnt confined to 
this region. Records from Corps 
district offices nation-wide show 
that the military agency, best 
-known for dam-building, is 
'granting more development per
mits in wetlands than ever 
before, denying next to none.
The Corps says that instead of 
simply turning down permit 
requests, it works with develop
ers to revise or redesign projects 
to minimize their impact on 
the environment.
But the Corps, historically 
an engineering and construc
tion agency with little experi
ence in environmental protec
tion, has tended to side with 
developers, builders, and 
extractive industries, and has 
spent little of its limited finan
cial resources on enforcement of 
wetland regulations.
It also gets a lot of political 
pressure  Sen. Robert Byrd, 
D-W.Va.  is holding up appro
priations bills in Congress now 
in an effort to change the Clean 
Water Act to permit the destruc
tion of wetlands and streams 
under coal waste deposited from 
mountain top mining activities.
As a result, critics say the 
agency is failing to live up to 
its responsibility to enforce the 
nations primary law preserv
ing swamps, fens, marshes, 
bogs, headwater streams, and 
seasonal ponds.
Nowhere is this more evident 
than in the Corps Pittsburgh 
District.
The district, covering Western 
Pennsylvania up to Erie and 
northern West Virginia, issued 
171 permits to develop, fill or 
drain wetlands or creeks, or 
impinge on streams or rivers, 
for the years 1996 through 
1998. It denied only one.
Over the last six years, 
Pittsburgh District Corps 
records show 298 permits issued 
and nine denied, with almost all 
the denials based on the pro
jects effect on navigation, not 
wetlands encroachment.
The vast majority of wetlands 
development permit approvals 
are for small areas, under half 
an acre, which have little indi
vidual impact.
But the Pittsburgh Corps also 
has approved dozens of permits 
affecting larger wetlands over 
the strong objections of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
 the federal entity that 
enforces endangered species 
and migratory bird laws  
as well as the state Fish and 
Boat Commission.
Even the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, which is sup
posed to work with the Corps in 
enforcing the wetlands rules, 
has questioned some of the 
Corps permits, especially in 
West Virginia. In that state, the 
Pittsburgh and Huntington, 
W.Va., Corps districts have per
mitted the filling of valleys with
coal mining waste, resulting in 
the loss of hundreds of acres of 
wetlands and 900 to 1,500 miles 
of streams.
In general, in Pittsburgh, 
if you apply for a permit 
youll get it, said Ed Perry, 
assistant supervisor at the 
Fish and Wildlife Service 
office in State College. Of 
all the districts we work 
with, Pittsburgh not only 
issues permits over our objec
tions, it is the least likely to 
respond to our objections.
Certainly in Pennsylvania, I 
would rate the Pittsburgh 
District the lowest. I dont think 
its ever denied any permit 
application on environmental 
grounds. Certainly it has never 
denied a proposed wetland fill 
that we have objected to in the 
history of the program.
Albert Rogalla, chief of the
Pittsburgh Corps regulatory 
branch since 1997, said the 
Corps has been even-handed 
in its permit actions.
We dont have to deny a 
permit to preserve the environ
ment, he said. Yes, weve 
allowed developers to do pro
jects. But weve also preserved 
some high-quality wetlands.
One example provided by 
the Corps is the Corridor-H 
highway project in West 
Virginia, a 100-mile long, 
four-lane road that originally 
went through 700 acres of 
wetlands. The Corps says that 
because it raised concerns about 
the route, the final permit for 
the project affects just 45 acres 
of wetlands.
Lately, wetlands filling 
and draining has increased 
in the Pittsburgh district by 
39 percent.

50 YEARS AGO, November 
22, 1949  Carnegie Tech fell 
far short of its expected Campus 
Chest quota for 1949. The stu
dent committee members had 
investigated many other meth
ods for raising additional funds, 
but they all violated the policy of 
having only one solicitation of 
funds per year.
25 YEARS AGO. November 
19, 1975  The tuition commit
tee, under the new chairperson 
Timothy McGuire, associate pro
fessor of economics and statis
tics, began reviewing aspects of 
Carnegie Mellons tuition.
The members of the organiza
tion included faculty, adminis
trators, and two students. 
Among the goals discussed was 
to establish a female element in 
the all-male organization.
10 YEARS AGO, November 
14, 1989  Carnegie Mellon 
Police intervened with junior 
art student Jessica Caplans 
plans to burn eight flags, 
including that of the U.S.
These flags are soaked in 
inflammable liquid, said Bob 
Anderegg, a senior facility safe
ty analyst for the University. 
Someone could be hurt. The 
potential for heated debates 
between some of the 150 assem
bled people also presented safe
ty concerns.
Caplan said she wanted to do 
this for political reasons. I did 
discuss in depth with Bob 
Anderegg what I was going to 
do.... He said hed supply the 
extinguishers and that it was a 
go.... The fact that my freedom 
was infringed upon is part of 
the piece.
FIVE YEARS AGO,
November 14, 1994  Entropy 
installed a video camera. 
According to Patricia Stacer, 
manager of Retail Services, it 
is nothing really new; we are 
just keeping up with the times. 
The camera cost $300.
When asked if anyone had 
been caught through the use of 
such security devices, Stacer 
said that it had proven success
ful with other campus stores in 
the past.
ONE YEAR AGO, November 
16, 1998  Student Senate and 
the Student Dormitory Council 
General Body passed a joint 
resolution condemning the 
administrations handling of 
modifications to Online 
Registration. The letter object
ed to the administrations
implementation of a lottery sys
tem, whereby students would 
be randomly assigned time 
slots throughout the day, after 
which they could register for 
new classes. They would not be 
able to register for classes 
before their assigned slot. 
Under the old system, all stu
dents could register as soon as 
registration started at 6 am, 
which led to network traffic 
problems.
The problem that we had 
was not with the lottery 
system, said Senator and 
SDC member Dominic Falso. 
We havent had a chance to 
sit down and look at it, and 
we wanted it to ... see how 
it works.

Institutions, believes that this case is 
based on an unjust premised with anti
trust. He says that Microsoft just 
offered products, and consumers could 
either take it or leave it.
Gates has a right to his wealth and 
property. He has no moral obligation to 
give to those as he was forced to do, 
said Crawford.
Other students feel that the judges 
decision might be beneficial for the com
puter industry.
I think that the decision will pave 
the way for some competition in the
industry. As it is, Microsoft has been 
throwing its weight around and 
thats essentially what the judge found. 
I dont know what theyll do to 
Microsoft, but hopefully it will allow for 
smaller companies to make some inno
vations and enter the market, said 
Simon Goldsmith, a junior computer 
science major.
There is also always the possibility 
that Microsoft is currently facing the 
type of competition that does not mean 
it is necessarily a monopoly.
Microsoft has been a major player in 
bringing affordable personal computing 
to the masses. Competition in the oper
ating system industry has never been 
greater with the advance of the iMac 
and the recent popularity of Linux,"

to help make them acces

After the infrastructure 
is suitable, the city 
should let the corpora

from the city.
When asked what the 
impact of TIFs are on

Thats why we should use 
them in truly blighted 
areas. If we decide to use 
a TIF, these foregone 
taxes should be consid
ered to be almost zero.

Vince has demonstrated 
down here since this build

Chief of Police Jim 
Lapaglia. Hes been arrest
ed well over a dozen times, 
for everything from chain
ing himself to the front door, 
to lying down on the street 
to block traffic. I really 
dont pay attention to what 
he says.
To those who attended the 
protest however, the subject 
of the operations conducted 
by the SEI is serious.
Were trying to raise 
awareness about the mili
tary contracts at this building and CMU in general. 
SEI is effectively a 
Department of Defense 
(DoD) building. Serious 
amounts of money, mostly 
in computer science, is used 
by the DoD, said junior 
materials and engineering 
major Cliff Brangwynne.
According to a written 
statement by William 
Pollok, public relations 
coordinator for the SEI, any 
allegations that the insti
tute helps engineer 
weapons systems are com
pletely false. That 90 per 
cent of our work is funded 
by federal sources, that 
we do some work that 
requires security clear
ances, and that we place 
some restrictions on infor
mation developed is part of 
our work. However, wide 
dissemination of informa
tion is essential to our mis
sion ... and we welcome the 
opportunity to dispel the 
myth that the SEI focuses 
on classified, secretive work 
for the government.
Weve got three volumes 
of this stretching back 15 
years, said Eirene. 
Were here with SEI 
because of their ongoing 
involvement with smart 
bombs. We thought this 
would be a way of jumpstarting what will be a very 
long campaign. They have 
extensive nuclear engineer 
contracts, specifically soft
ware contracts.
Specific evidence that the 
SEI collaborates in such 
projects, however, is scarce.

we cant get that. They 
say it isnt classified

said Brangwynne.
The SEI does not devel

is built by organizations 
that use SEI techniques,

Crime and Incident Report
11/6 DISORDERLY CONDUCT, 
1:08 am  Two CMU students were 
caught by Pittsburgh City Police for 
overturning a dumpster within the 
fraternity quad. Both were issued 
CMU internal citations for Disorderly 
Conduct. The dumpster was returned 
to its upright position, and the stu
dents cleaned up the garbage from 
the ground.
11/8 INCIDENT, 10:45 am  Six
beer cans were found on the 
Morewood playground. A teacher at 
the Cyert Center for Early Education 
noticed a child, earlier in the morning, 
with a can in their hands, lifting it to 
drink. Upon noticing it was a beer can, 
the teacher quickly took it from the 
child, before the child could drink. She 
also saw five other cans in the area, 
all of which she threw away. This is 
the second time that containers of 
beer have been found in the play
ground area.
11/8 THEFT, 9:15 am  A theft was 
reported by a campus food vendor. 
Among the items missing were a tank 
of Coke syrup, valued at $50.00, a 
dozen donuts, valued at $12.00, and 
three covers from a soda-dispensing 
machine, of unknown value. The 
actors also attempted to remove a 
tank of C02 from the pop machine, 
but failed. The donuts are delivered in 
the mornings, in a container with 
muffins and apple.fritters, before any
one reports to work. For the past three 
weeks, all the donuts have been 
taken. The vandals also have occa
sionally taken bites out of pastries 
and placed them back in the delivery 
container. The staff has tried to hide
the deliveries, but the actors always 
find the food.
11/11 CRIMINAL TRESPASS, 9:46
am  The construction company 
working on the Purnell Center for the 
Arts reported that they had just 
removed a very large unauthorized 
poster from the roof of the building. 
The poster was a 40-foot square blue 
construction tarp, spray-painted white 
with CMU on top, two stick figures of 
people copulating, FUCK and 
YOU. At the bottom was painted 
Why obey Morons. The construction 
crew was concerned because the only 
way to the roof was through a hatch 
accessible only via catwalks above the 
backstage of the theatre; both doors to 
the catwalks were locked. The hatch to 
the roof was not locked, but the intrud
ers placed a padlock on it, wrapped in 
duct tape, as they left.
11/11 VEHICLE STOP AND TOW, 
10:41 pm  A Campus Police officer 
observed a car traveling on Forbes 
Avenue towards Oakland run the red 
light at Forbes and Margaret Morrison 
Street. The officer followed the car onto 
Forbes, and activated his cars bar lights 
and siren. The car stopped at the red 
light at Forbes and Beeler Street, and as 
the officer was about to exit his vehicle, 
the light changed, and the car proceeded 
through the intersection. The car 
attempted the same action at the light at 
Forbes and Morewood Avenue, but the 
officer cut him off, forcing the car to stop. 
The driver of the vehicle was starting to 
exit his vehicle, and the Campus Police 
officer explained that he must stop when 
sirens and light are behind him. The offi
cer radioed for backup, because the dri
ver would not remain inside his vehicle.; 
The operator of the vehicle provided the; 
officers with current registration and; 
insurance information for the vehicle,; 
but had only a learners permit issued; 
earlier in November. The driver stated; 
that he had taken his first test, and had; 
failed it.
The officers told the driver that he', 
was not permitted to drive with a; 
learners permit, without a licensed; 
driver next to him. Since the driver1, 
had no one available to accompany; 
him, the officers ordered a tow and; 
impoundment of the vehicle. The dri-; 
ver was issued PA traffic citations for; 
running a red light, failing to yield toj 
an emergency vehicle, and operating; 
the vehicle with a learners permit; 
and no accompaniment. While the offi
cer was writing up the citations, the 
driver stated that he does secret 
research for the government, and 
Campus Police will all be in trouble 
for doing this to [him].
 Campus Chief of Police James 
Lapaglia reviews all reports prior Jxj 
release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the Editor-inChief the News Editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of com-, 
plainants, victims, suspects, and fra
ternities are omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other, 
personal details are given only in the 
context of complete descriptions.
 Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

Many students feel disen
chanted with the inconsisten
cies of the advising process and 
Worry that it has become too 
mechanized. Advising on this 
campus has come a long way, 
but it needs to keep progress
ing. The online audit and cur
rent advising programs are a 
good start, but still need work 
to make them the programs 
which they were designed to be.
:The online audit offers sub
stantial benefits to students 
planning their schedules. It 
allows a student to check the 
status of his or her major at any 
time, day or night. 
Unfortunately, it has not yet 
been expanded to all majors, 
nor does it include double 
majors or minors. While it is 
understandable that such 
changes take time, these extra 
features need to be added into 
the system soon. Without them, 
many people will be at a signif
icant disadvantage when plan
ning their class schedules.
Additionally, although the 
online audit has helped ease the 
load on academic advisors, 
some students have used it 
instead of a trip to the advisors 
office. Worse, some depart
ments, such as Electrical and 
Computer Engineering, have 
adopted the audit as a substi
tute for real advising. They will 
ask students to print out the 
online audit and bring it in with 
them to a meeting. Once in the 
meeting, the advisor will simply 
point out the obvious holes in 
the students transcript. This 
is not advising, and it needs 
to change.
,The advising process itself 
could benefit from changes as 
well. Currently, the process 
varies greatly from college to 
college, and even sometimes 
from department to depart
ment. Some colleges have one 
advisor for all students, while 
others have many faculty mem
ber advisors. Despite the incon
sistencies across colleges, many 
of the current advising setups 
work well. GSIA has one advi
sor for each class of about 90 
students. This setup helps 
ensure that consistent decisions 
are made for all students, lead
ing to far fewer errors. SCS has 
one advisor for first-year stu
dents and one for upperclass
men. The advantage of this 
arrangement is similar to that 
of GSIAs: A single contact 
;ensures that consistent advice 
is given. Additionally, having a 
separate advisor specializing in 
first-year students helps make 
sure that their needs  which 
often differ from those of upper
classmen  are met. H&SS has 
a team of general advisors in 
the Academic Advisory Center 
that advises humanities stu
dents on general educational 
requirements. This team is 
small enough that its members 
;can stay in constant contact 
with students, and it allows 
students to get centralized 
advice on those requirements 
consistent across all of H&SS.
However, in-major advising in 
H&SS is inconsistent from
department to department. 
Some departments have a dedi
cated advisor, while others arbi
trarily assign students to facul
ty members. The latter 
approach has a serious draw
back: Not all faculty members 
are interested in the advising 
process. When they arent, stu
dents feel as though they are 
unwanted and simply an extra 
burden on the faculty who 
advise them. More importantly, 
the faculty member may not 
know enough about advising to 
be of real assistance. In the 
interest of having students 
receive good advice and have a 
positive advising experience, 
departments should designate 
specific advisors, and these spe
cific advisors should be faculty 
members who have an active 
interest in carrying out 
this duty.
Advising is more than just 
course selection, however. An 
advisor should also be able to 
provide guidance for undecided 
students. Selecting a major is 
difficult for many students, and 
given the depth of many pro
grams at CMU, it is often hard 
to switch from one major to 
another without having to 
spend one or more additional 
semesters making up the differ
ence. Thus, picking a major is 
an important decision, and it is 
one for which advice should be 
available if a student feels it 
is needed.
Academic advisors should also 
be able to assist students in 
planning for graduate school or 
a career. Having dedicated, in
department advisors is also 
beneficial in this respect. A sin
gle, dedicated advisor often 
leads to a stronger bond 
between student and advisor, 
which often carries on after 
graduation. Then, the advisor 
has access to a valuable source 
of information to pass on to cur
rent students  that gleaned 
from alumni who have experi
enced these options firsthand. 
Such a resource would make an 
ideal complement to the Career 
Center, as it would complete the 
link between students academ
ic studies and their post-gradu
ation plans.
Student Senate recently 
began an initiative to evaluate 
and improve faculty advising in 
H&SS. The plan is to imple
ment a survey for advisors sim
ilar to the current faculty 
course evaluations, to look at 
where H&SS advising is strong 
and where it needs improve
ment. This initiative is a wel
come step in the effort to 
strengthen advisory programs, 
and hopefully it will carry over 
into other colleges so that they 
may benefit from it as well.
Academic advising is a key 
part of an undergraduate edu
cation  in fact, it can help 
undeclared students define 
their education to suit their 
needs. While many current 
advisors and advising programs 
are good  and a handful are 
outstanding  others exhibit 
serious shortcomings that 
should be addressed.

Letters to The Editor
Modify, dont 
kill, Fence rules
Editor:
I am writing in 
regards to Prof. 
Sandages letter about 
misusing the FenceLetter to
the Editor [Students must not 
abuse Fence, Nov. 8]. While I agree 
that certain groups do take advantage 
of the Fence by posting useless and 
insulting messages, I feel that there is 
a value to keeping the Fence and 
upholding its tradition. I personally 
oversaw a Fence painting effort to 
publicize Mayurs cultural show. What 
I observed was a high level of cama
raderie and enthusiasm that gave a 
sense of unity to our organization. 
There were approximately 10-15 peo
ple braving the below-freezing tem
peratures and missing sleep to accom
plish a common goal. Not only did I 
enjoy the company of old friends, but I 
also had a chance to interact closely 
with people I had never met before. 
We realized that we all shared a deep 
respect for our ancestral culture, and 
we were willing to demonstrate this 
respect by painting the Fence. So even 
when our effort was belittled by van
dals, most of us were not upset. 
Vandals cannot desecrate our unity, 
rob us of our enthusiasm, or make us 
forget the bonding experience.
I agree with Prof. Sandages argu
ment that some groups bring shame to 
the campus by their treatment of the 
Fence and its neighboring trees. 
However, eliminating the Fence is not 
the solution. For even though the mes
sage one paints on it is only tempo
rary, it espouses a sense of unity and 
it shows us that there are others who
share our vision.
I think one solution is limiting the 
time any one group can hold the Fence 
to one week. Also, the rules should 
allow only camping tents and bar the 
use of electronic devices past 1 am. 
Eliminating the Fence altogether 
would mean erasing a legacy. It would 
prohibit those who never painted the 
Fence from ever experiencing the spir
it involved in such an endeavor.

Teams words 
show disrespect
Editor:
I am writing to 
address the article 
from the November 1, 
1999 edition, NCAA 
Overturns Soccer
Letter to 
the Editor
Decision and more specifically, the 
comments made therein. As a former 
student-athlete at Carnegie Mellon 
(Golf, 1986-1990), I find it very 
disturbing that student-athletes 
would make such remarks about 
the athletic director and the athle
tic administration.
Everyone wants to win, and every
one hates to lose. What separates the 
true sportsmen and sportswomen 
from the rest is the way that 
they handle each situation. As an. ath
lete at Carnegie Mellon, I was taught 
to be humble in victory and gracious 
in defeat.
The questioning of Dr. John 
Harveys commitment, support, or 
integrity is completely preposterous.
Dr. Harvey has served this University 
for 10 years as Athletic Director and is 
respected throughout the NCAA. He 
has served as chair of several national 
committees, including the NCAA 
Committee for Sportsmanship and 
Ethical Conduct. Throughout his 
tenure at Carnegie Mellon, he has 
earned the respect of athletes, coach
es, staff, and administrators. For any
one, especially student-athletes, to 
make comments such as those printed 
in the Tartan article, is absolutely 
ridiculous. Regardless of the situation, 
an athlete should never be publicly 
disrespectful to an administrator, 
player, or coach.
Before every UAA sporting event 
contested at Carnegie Mellon, the fol
lowing code of sportsmanship is read: 
Carnegie Mellon and the members 
of the University Athletic Association 
are committed to principles of 
good sportsmanship. We believe that 
all student-athletes, coaches, and 
spectators should strive to represent 
the very best spirit and tradi
tion of intercollegiate athletics. We 
request your cooperation by support
ing the participants and officials in a 
positive manner.
I would ask the members of the 
mens soccer team to reflect on these 
words, and decide if their conduct and 
actions were in line with this code. 
After having done so, I would hope 
that they will recognize their mistake 
and take the necessary measures 
to apologize to Dr. Harvey in as 
public a manner as he was so inappro
priately disrespected. I would also 
hope that The Tartan would provide 
the athletes the forum to accomplish 
this task.

The 90s have seen an 
uninterrupted flow of spend

get, despite the end of the 
Cold War, which has justi
fied it for the past 50 years. 
Never mind that the Soviet 
Union, as it turns out, was 
admittedly never viewed as 
a credible threat by British 
intelligence, and it has been 
discovered that the FBI fab
ricated reports of Soviet mil
itary expenditures to 
encourage our own. The 
American public should find 
this astonishing; it has truly 
not been a good decade for 
Americas enemies, yet the 
nations wealth is being 
channeled away from its 
education, infrastructure, 
and social services, into its 
bloated military.

many more crucial issues that 
they need to be gridlocked on.
Now, Im not saying that 
smoking isnt bad. I, for one, 
have never understood how 
anyone thought it up. I guess 
that, a long time ago, a couple 
of guys came upon a tobacco 
plant, and one suggested, Lets 
roll it up, light it on fire, and 
stick it in our mouths! Itll be
fun! And everyone did what he 
said, because, back then, they 
probably thought crazy people 
had magical powers or some
thing. If theres one thing I 
learned from history, its that 
people from a long 
time ago were real
ly, really stupid.
Were not so 
dumb, though.
Everyone who 
smokes knows its 
bad for them, so 
why all the. fuss?
Some would say its 
because Big 
Tobacco has been 
lying to us, saying 
that nicotine isnt 
addictive and that 
cigarettes dont 
cause cancer. Well 
then, is any one of 
you willing to 
admit that you 
were so dumb that 
you actually
believed them? Are 
there really idiots out there who 
still dont know that cigarettes 
arent healthy, who need warn
ing labels to be larger to realize 
that smoking is a bad thing? 
If there really are people this 
moronic, theyre probably
radio with them into the tub 
or trying to dry their hair 
using the microwave than ciga
rette smoke.
The other complaint is that
tribution to the work force could 
easily be replaced by a robot, a 
trained chimp, or a paperweight 
if smoking killed them off.
All Im saying is that I dont
ing to get kids to smoke. Maybe 
this is true, but from what I 
remember from high school, it 
wasnt the honor students who 
were smoking. It was all the 
dumb kids standing across the 
street smoking on a cold winmore likely to die from taking a ters day, people whose later conthe tobacco companies are try- see what the problem is if peo
ple, knowing the 
consequences, 
decide to smoke. As 
long as Im not suf
focating in it, I dont 
care. Yet still it 
seems that some 
people have nothing 
better to do than vil
ify tobacco. Theres 
even a movie out 
called The Insider 
about someone 
revealing the
secret that tobacco 
companies know 
that cigarettes are 
bad for you. Wow, 
whodve thunk? 
Next maybe well 
get a thriller about a 
corporate insider 
who reveals that 
Chia Pets arent really hours of 
fun for the kids. I mean, how 
pathetic is this? Back in the 
good ol* days, our movie villains 
were communists, truly evil 
beings who wished to destroy 
our apple pie-eating, freedomSam Lind/Tartan Art Staff
loving way of life, but now we
have tobacco corporations who 
want to convince  not force  
people to smoke cigarettes 
which will maybe kill them after 
many, many years.
And whats behind this cru
sade against tobacco? Well, in 
this world there are things 
called lawyers. They are devil
ish, conniving creatures who 
find ways of setting people 
against each other so that they 
can extract money. Theyve come 
upon a plan to get the govern
ment to sue for all the medical 
bills people willingly give them
selves by smoking. And why 
do this? Well, because it is a lot 
of money  billions of dollars  
and the lawyers will get quite 
a large cut of it, which they 
need because being an agent of 
Satan is solely a commission job. 
Some of you may think the 
lawyers are doing this not for 
money but for the principle 
of stopping all the suffering 
caused by evil tobacco, but, if 
you really are gullible enough to 
buy that one, then ... Hey, look! 
I got your nose!

The Pope recently concluded a peaceful 
trip to India, during which he officially 
released a document that states the 
churchs goal of the conversion of the 
non-Catholic majority of Asia. The docu
ment, which The New York Times calls a 
pastoral guidebook for Asia, calls upon 
Roman Catholic bishops to respect other 
religions, but not forget their call to con
version. The New York Times para
phrases the Popes views, in its tradition
ally politically correct tone, The Pope 
notes that other faiths can lead to salva
tion, but stated that Christianity is the 
true path.
It seems, that India, which is one of the 
few countries in the world that recog
nizes the Pope as a head of state, contin
ued its proud tradition of tolerance 
and peace during this latest visit. It is 
interesting to note that China, Taiwan 
and Sri Lanka refused the Popes request
to visit. Meanwhile, the government 
of India, a country in which less than 3 
percent of the population associates 
itself with the church, not only accepted 
his request, but took every care to ensure 
his safety and comfort. It is also worth 
nothing that the Catholic Church also 
kept with its long tradition of hypocrisy 
and disrespect.
The Pope didnt come to India on a 
political mission to encourage and pro
mote an understanding between the nonCatholic majority of Asia and the 
Church. He came to India to launch a 
new era of unparalleled missionary con
versions. According to Dr. Frawley of 
the American Institute for Vedic Studies, 
Current missionary plans to convert 
India, both by Catholics and Protestants, 
are the greatest in history in terms of 
financial backing, media manipulation 
and manpower support. Asia is a critical 
target for the Vatican at a time when the 
Catholic Church is losing influence in 
the West. This is evinced by the fact that 
many Catholics are only nominal in 
their beliefs; for example, many 
American Catholics practice birth con
trol and dont attend church on a regular
basis, neither of which the church con
dones. The church is looking to large 
populations of Asia who have a history of 
religious devotion to replenish its popu
lation base.
The Pope held mass for 65,000 of 
Indias Catholics on Sunday, November 
6. The mass had a quaint Indian touch; 
young girls in local costumes danced 
to Indian classical music, an oil lamp 
was lit to begin the service, and the 
Pope was greeted in Sanskrit. The mass 
coincided with Divali, the high point 
of the Hindu festival season, a celebra
tion of lights. During the mass, the Pope 
and other speakers drew parallels 
between Divali and the biblical theme 
of light conquering darkness. My heart 
is moved by the churchs attempts 
to embrace Indian culture in the 
same way I appreciate that McDonalds 
now offers vegetarian burgers in India. 
The Vatican is continuing its long-stand
ing tradition of co-opting local tradition 
in order to make the faith more palat
able, a tradition that began when the 
Greek pagan philosophies of Aristotle 
and Socrates were adopted as the basis 
for Christian theology.
The problem I have with the Popes 
recent behavior is his outright hypocrisy. 
Even though the church claims that 
intolerance is a thing of the past, it is 
interesting to note the official policy of 
the Catholic Church today is still that 
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism 
and other Indian religions are not valid 
or true. The abovementioned religions 
have no teachings comparable to 
Christianitys commandment against 
idolatry  it is not uncommon to find a 
picture of Christ in the home of a Hindu. 
I have much greater respect for churches 
such as the Southern Baptists who open
ly teach that Hindus are devil wor
shipers. Southern Baptists recently 
released a series of booklets urging 
Southern Baptists (whose ranks include 
A1 Gore and Bill Clinton) to pray for 
Hindus deliverance from Satan. Pray for 
me, Bill! Apparently, hate and intoler
ance are not things taught at the fringes 
of western society  they are main
stream concepts.

Activist legend Phillip 
Berrigan spoke on our campus 
last Thursday, Armistice Day. 
The main point of his lecture 
concerned the immorality of the 
increasin miitarism of the 
United States, an agenda that is 
becoming continually more 
entrenched in its economic and 
political system. The simple fact 
is that the U.S. economy is sus
tained by war; it has been since 
World War II. As Berrigan 
explained, war is our number
one industry. This relationship 
of blood and money, the pouring 
of public money into the corpo
rate coffers of arms manufactur
ers, is known as the militaryindustrial complex.
Some argue that the militaryindustrial complex is crucial to 
our economy and progress; for 
example, without the 
Department of Defense, who 
would fund the bulk of Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys research? 
Sure enough, the purpose of our 
Software Engineering Institute
(SEI), as defined in its own lit
erature, is finding ways to 
move state-of-the-art technology 
out of the laboratory and into 
military systems more quickly. 
The SEIs apologists have since 
backed away from this position, 
arguing that military projects 
such as missile guidance and 
bomb damage assessment also 
have civilian uses. However, 
professors have pointed out 
that civilian applications are 
unlikely with military funding. 
SEI is in fact a direct branch of
the Pentagon, lying inside a formost research university. 
Certainly, CMU is not alone in 
this role.
However, its fallacious to 
assume that the military budget 
is essential for such reasons. 
Our public resources do not 
have to be channeled through 
bloodshed to create progress. 
Indeed, civilian funding of 
research would probably lead 
to useful civilian applications, 
and a better society overall. 
These control structures exist
only because of unchecked 
corporate power, which will 
certainly be overturned one day. 
In the meantime, it might 
help to actually raise questions 
about issues like SEI, which are 
actually more pertinent than 
the Highlander menu, though 
thats not what youre supposed 
to believe.

The Supreme Court may 
soon decide on a case about 
whether students must be 
forced to fund groups they 
dont agree with with an

been an issue at CMU, we

of this? ,w9utIp yc

I dont see why people 
shouldnt have to fund contro

the government does that too; 
people have to support the

I think that when you go to 
a university, there are some 
things you like and some you 
dont. The student activities

I dont think its fair that 
some organizations do bene
fit from it but not others. It 
should not be restricted; all 
organizations should bene
fit from it.
Even though the money 
goes to things I dont like, it 
also goes to things I do like.

I Column As I See em
by Colt Foutz
If boxing really wanted to save 
itself, it would sign Charles 
Barkley and Shaquille ONeal to 
a live pay-per-view event, where 
the two could reprise their NBA 
game last Wednesday. Shaq 
threw an errant elbow under the 
hoop, striking Barkley, and 
Barkley decided that was grounds 
enough to bounce the ball off of 
Shaqs head.
In the Houston/L.A. game, the 
refs quickly intervened, pulling 
Barkley off of Shaq before either 
could land a punch. Then, the 
NBA decided that what its fans 
really should be enjoying is bas
ketball, and not Friday Night 
Fights, and suspended both 
Barkley and Shaq for last Fridays 
Rockets/Lakers rematch; For 
Rockets fans, the game provided 
sweet revenge. Even without Sir 
Charles in the lineup, they 
pounded on the Lakers and won 
their first game of the season. 
But for boxing fans, there can be 
no solace the second time around. 
While basketball benefits from 
two Rockets/Lakers tilts in the 
same week, boxing is cursed with 
two Evander Holyfield/Lennox 
Lewis heavyweight world 
championship bouts in the same 
year. Someone get Shaq on the 
line, quick.
Whether you love it, hate it, or 
find it as irrelevant to the sports 
world as full-contact medieval 
field chess, boxing has picked 
1999 as the year to deliver a 
knockout punch to itself. Of 
course, the same case could have 
been made for 1997, when Mike 
Tyson displayed his rare appe
tite for ears; or 1998, when Tyson 
assaulted two motorists in New 
Jersey instead of just focusing on 
the tomato can opponents he had 
lined up before him, and returned 
to prison. But that was before the 
first Holyfield/Lewis fight, which 
set off the most recent combina
tion of left and right jabs to the 
head which have left boxing blood
ied, dazed, and probably unable 
to answer the bell for the 
next round.
Maybe with Holyfield/Lewis, 
we should have seen it coming. 
Ridiculousness seems to follow 
Holyfield in the ring like Tyson 
follows Miss Take-Your-Pick 
banners at a beauty pageant. 
Anyone remember Holyfields
fight with Riddick Bowe a few 
years back, where a parachute 
man dropped from the sky and 
crashed into the ropes? Or the 
stories that came out after Tyson 
decided to nibble sweet nothings 
in Holyfields ear in their June 
1997 rematch? We learned that 
Holyfield, too, used to employ the 
occasional head butt or ear bite 
when he got behind in his early 
bouts. So, its not just a hunger 
pang, folks  its ringside strat
egy! Still, none of these incidences 
of apron anarchy could prepare 
us for the result handed down 
after the fight last March.
Again, we cant really blame 
Holyfield for this one.
All he did was show 
up overmatched. For 
12 rounds, Lewis gave 
Holyfield the beating 
of his life, landing 348 
punches to Holyfields 
130. Anyone who saw 
the fight got the feel
ing that boxing would 
finally crown an honest-to-goodness cham
pion, one who had won 
it in the ring by sim
ply outclassing his op
ponent, and not low
ering the match to 
farce and subsequent 
disqualifications and 
legal battles by resort
ing to Tysons tactics.
With Holyfield 
bruised and barely 
able to stand, and call
ing a doctor as he 
cramped up after the 
fight, the decision 
looked clear. The box
ers had done their 
jobs, respectively.
Now it was up to 
the judges.
Well, one of the 
judges, Stanley 
Christodolou, gave the 
fight clearly to Lewis.
But in boxing, it takes 
three to tango. Judge 
Larry OConnell saw 
it even, and judge 
Eugenia Williams 
gave the fight to 
Holyfield by two 
rounds. The fight was ruled a 
draw, and both fighters walked 
away with the titles they came in 
with. But boxing left that ring a 
clear loser. When asked about 
her decision in the weeks after 
the fight, Ms. Williams alter
nately defended her decision and 
offered excuses, including claims 
that her view of the fight was 
often blocked. I called what I 
saw, Williams said, meaning no 
ill will toward this column, of 
course, but ensuring incredulous 
head slaps from boxing fans
worldwide. She called what she 
saw? Someone get this lady a nice 
seat at the next lawn chess match!
Since the Holyfield/Lewis de
bacle, boxing has suffered from 
increasingly ludicrous fights and 
damaging revelations about the 
sports judging. Tyson has done 
his part as boxings most accom
plished ambassador of ill will by 
turning in lackluster perfor
mances against weak opponents. 
True to form, though, his perfor
mances havent been lacking in 
controversy. In his last fight, 
Tyson felled light-punching Orlin 
Norris with a shot after the bell 
sounded, and then watched the
deliver perplexing performances 
as he battered opponent Felix 
Trinidad in their fight this past 
September, only to dance away 
from Trinidads blows in the later 
rounds, giving frustrated judges 
a reason to hand the fight and De 
La Hoyas belt to Trinidad. The 
night before Tysons no-no in Ve
gas, WBO featherweight cham
pion Prince Naseem Hamed en
livened his title bout with WBC 
champ Cesar Soto with head butts 
and a body slam in the fifth round 
that would make any professional 
wrestler proud. After both boxers 
collapsed to the apron at the end 
of the match, Hamed jumped to
the IBF branch of boxing were 
found to have participated, along 
with several fighters, in taking 
bribes to fix fights. In one case, 
this directly implicates the judges 
and the boxing opponent for 
George Foreman in one of the 
early bouts when he launched his 
comeback in 1985. What, like the 
infomercial dollars couldnt wait 
another year, George?
Twenty-five years ago boxing 
meant something, and George 
Foreman was involved in one of 
the greatest fights in boxing his
tory. In Zaire, Africa, Foreman 
and Muhammad Ali showcased 
the skill, courage, heart, and
fight be ruled a no-contest as 
Norris declined to re-enter the 
ring, claiming he twisted his knee 
when falling to the canvas. Fol
lowing another Tyson fight tradi
tion, this bout is still being con
tested in the courts, with Tysons 
suspension from fighting in Ne
vada again a possibility.
And the trend of punch-drunk 
idiocy is not limited to the heavy
weight ranks. Popular American 
welterweight and former Olym
pic gold medalist Oscar De La 
Hoya continued his tendency to
his feet and declared his victory. 
In this case, he was right, but 
what does boxing gain when its 
most notable fights start to re
semble WCW Deathmatch IV? 
Personally, Id choose the madeup story lines of wrestling over 
the real-life melodrama of boxing 
any day. Wrestling is far more 
entertaining, and increasingly 
more athletic.
Thats not to say that boxing 
isnt trying like hell to match the 
fictional charm of pro wrestling. 
Earlier this month, judges from
Till BtbwWvi4lig V4l slihh
athleticism that made boxing so 
captivating and worth watching. 
Ali fought Foreman for the chance 
to regain the heavyweight title 
that the U.S. government had 
essentially stripped from him af
ter his refusal to fight in Viet
nam. Ali was an underdog to Fore
man, the younger man with the 
killer punch. Some even feared 
for Alis safety in the ring, but 
like the champion of champions 
that Ali was, he knew something 
about himself and his remark
able abilities that we did not.
In the early rounds Ali wentj 
against everything his corner j 
advised him to do by walking to J 
the ropes, raising his arms and; 
letting Foreman rain blow after' 
bone-shaking blow to his body.; 
Against all rational expectation,,1 
Ali did not go down. Later in the* 
fight, when Foremans energy had | 
been exhausted, and his spirit] 
broken, Ali stepped up and! 
knocked Foreman out. That day,! 
Alis legend grew beyond that of a j 
mere fighter, and George Fore-| 
man became haunted for the rest; 
of his life. Boxing itself became a\ 
fable of manhood, and our will to I 
struggle in the face of certain! 
doom, to stand and be true. J
Today, boxing is a farce, and; 
Foreman is a fat symbol of corpo-J 
rate and marketing excess. Alis J 
mind has succumbed to the years J 
of punishment his body took, and! 
even though his spirit has tran-| 
scended boxing and made him; 
the most-loved and most-recog-| 
nized figure in all of sport, one; 
cant help but wonder: Was it; 
worth it? The only Ali fighting \ 
today is his daughter, boxer Laila, \ 
and the only place you can en-J 
counter Ali in his younger glory 
 save for a classic sports reel j 
is by taking him on in EA Sportss \ 
Knockout Kings 2000 video game.'
Oh yeah, and about Holyfield/j 
Lewis II. They fought again, inj 
Vegas this time, on Saturday] 
night. Lewis won the bout, unify-\ 
ing boxings three fractured! 
heavyweight titles. But who! 
cares? Who really won here? The; 
reason the fight took place at allj 
is due to the pull of the almighty' 
dollar that demanded a rematch, j 
So promoter Don King won, again. 
But the pay-per-view ratings were 
much lower than expected, and 
rumors abound with casino high! 
rollers who returned their tickets! 
to this fight. In fact, promotions! 
didnt even refer to the event as aj 
rematch, lest customers be reminded of the original fight. As! 
for boxings remaining fans, our! 
attention is continually diverted! 
to sports that promise fair re-| 
suits, less unsavory athletes and! 
officials, and actual entertain-! 
ment value. Thats right, wed! 
rather tune in to Foxs network! 
broadcast of championship bass! 
fishing than pony up more dough! 
to contribute to the undying death! 
throes of a disturbing, dumb, and! 
destructive sport.
I dont know about you all, but! 
Ill be at the lake practicing!

8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 November 1999Hockey season gets off to strange start
In The Slot
by Matt Brun
The NHL season is almost one-quarter complete already, and along with 
some great hockey, there have been a 
number of intriguing stories popping up 
all over the place.
Early-season critiques rarely mean 
anything in the end, but theyre fun to do 
anyway, especially evaluations of how 
each team did in signing free agents in 
the off-season. For all the flak Neil Smith 
; and the New York Rangers got for spend
ing over $50 million on six players, I 
iant think of any example of someone 
getting less for their money. The Rang'ers havent won in their last six home 
games, the last of which was a 5-2 drub
bing at the hands of the Boston Bruins, 
-during which the Madison Square Gar
den faithful led raucous cheers of Fire 
[head coach John] Muckier!
 For all the millions New York poured 
into forwards Theo Fleury and Valeri 
;Kamenski, the Rangers have gotten al' most zero return. New York is one of the
worst scoring teams in the league, and 
before scoring a power-play goal in the 
loss to Boston, had been 0-for-38 with 
the man advantage over their last 
six games.
Ive never been a big fan of the Rang
ers, but Im loving this. For once, a team 
is finding out that trying to buy a cham
pionship is a risky prospect, at best. The 
Rangers spent and spent on pure talent, 
but they ended up with a team of super
stars who have no chemistry and cant 
play together. The results have been 
painfully obvious in the standings as the 
Rangers have plummeted while teams 
who kept most of their team intact from 
last season  like the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, Ottawa Senators, and Detroit Red 
Wings  are enjoying lots of success.
Speaking of Ottawa, the Senators had 
one of the most interesting free agent 
dealings Ive ever seen with holdout cap
tain Alexei Yashin. With one year left on 
his contract, Yashin decided to hold out 
for a more profitable extension. Sena
tors ownership refused, and last Mon
day suspended Yashin for the year for 
not honoring his current contract. Not 
only is Yashin not getting a new deal, 
hes not getting paid the balance of his 
current one, either.
This example of a team taking a stand 
on player salaries is a long-awaited first. 
Since the NHL operates without a sal
ary cap, there is nothing to stop teams 
like the Rangers from driving player
salaries well past the roof and basically 
out of the solar system. Even when a 
team doesnt agree to a players initial 
demands, the desire to stay competitive 
almost always overrules monetary con
cerns, and the player makes it big. By 
taking a stand against Yashin, the Sena
tors may be the first of what would be a 
very welcome trend.
Even without Yashin, last years teamleading scorer, Ottawa is off to a great 
start. The Senators are leading the East
ern Conference with 26 points, and rookie 
sensation Marion Hossa is making fans 
everywhere forget Yashin completely. If 
Yashin were to come back to the team 
anytime soon, the Sens could very well 
be a favorite for the Stanley Cup.
On the other end of the spectrum is the 
defending Cup champion Dallas Stars. 
The collection of aging veterans that has 
led the team in recent years has been 
looking ancient most of this year, and as 
a result, the champs are languishing in 
the cellar of the Pacific Division.
Following the Stars down are the Colo
rado Avalanche. Since winning the cup 
in 96, the Lanche have never looked 
quite as good, and this year, theyre 
starting to look awful. Goalie Patrick 
Roy, a lock for the Hall of Fame, entered 
the season with a shot at becoming the 
NHLs all-time-winningest goalie, but is 
taking his sweet time getting there. 
Colorado has been erratic all year, but 
still manages to tenuously cling on to
second place in the incredibly weak 
Northwest Division.
On the individual side of things, the 
case of whos hot and whos not is a lot 
clearer. With all-world goalie Dominik 
Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres out for the 
next couple of months with a torn groin 
muscle, the Pittsburgh Penguins 
Jaromir Jagr is staking a major claim to 
the title of Greatest Player in the PostWayne Gretzky World. If there was any 
doubt when Hasek was injured, the Pen
guins last 15 games have pretty much 
eradicated it. Despite the Penguins 4- 
6-5 record, Jagr has a point in each 
game, 33 total, and is already running 
away with the leagues scoring title once 
again. While 15 games is a bit shy of 
Gretzkys record 51-game scoring streak, 
Jagr continues to show that he can do 
everything short of win games by him
self. I dont usually need a reason to 
watch a hockey game, but any game that 
Jagrs playing in is more than worth the 
price of admission.
Including the Senators, a glance at the 
current division leaders is an extended 
list of whos not in the NHL. Traditional 
powers like Dallas are floundering while 
growing teams like the San Jose Sharks 
and Toronto Maple Leafs are finally 
starting to make a case for themselves 
as legitimate contenders.
The Sharks currently lead the Pacific 
division for the first time since, well, as 
long as I can remember. Joining the
Sharks on the top of the heap are the 
Vancouver Canucks, finally returning 
to the form that took them to the Stanley 
Cup finals in 1994.
Over in the East, Ottawa leads Toronto 
by just two -points, while the Florida 
Panthers lead the collection of lousy 
teams that is the Southeast Division. 
The Atlantic is currently ruled by the 
Philadelphia Flyers, who appear to have 
put aside their incessant internal squab
bling for another regular-season run that 
is sure to crumble in the playoffs.
That leaves the Detroit Red Wings as 
the constant power in the NHL. With 
Dallas and Colorado in decline, the 
Wings path through the Western Con
ference appears clear of obstacles right 
now, and the Wings are hungry for vic
tory again after having their two-year 
hold on the cup snapped by Colorado in 
the playoffs last season.
Things could and certainly will change 
between now and the beginning of the 
playoffs in May, but for the time being, 
the Wings are once again the class of the 
league, and unless an older power or 
young upstart gets it together, there will 
be more partying in Hockey Town.
Matt Brun plans to attend as many 
Penguins games as he can afford this 
year, but is starting to wish hed gone to 
a school in Detroit so he could watch the 
Wings a few times in person rather than 
on ESPN.

In the Red Zone
by Nathan Steinwald
At just past the halfway point 
in the NFL season things are 
^starting to sort themselves out a 
kittle bit. Aside from some of the
teams that have gone bust de
spite great expectations and poor 
offensive performances of some 
teams, there havent been many 
things to complain about in the 
season. However, a number of 
people have once again brought 
up the complaint of parity this 
year in the NFL.
Why is there this supposed par
ity? Most people blame free 
agency and salary caps and leave 
behind the issue of parity as a 
given factor to be debated from
year to year. But what if there 
isnt parity?
Now, nobody has ripped 
through teams on a consistent 
basis the way that Minnesota and 
Denver did last year, but there 
are still some very good teams. 
There are also some very bad 
teams. A look at the standings 
shows that, aside from the AFC 
East, most of the league has 
separated itself into three 
camps: the good, the mediocre, 
and the pitiful.

Across the 
league there are 
nine teams with 
records four 
games above 
.500 or better.
The NFC East is 
the only division 
without a team 
in that category.
However that 
number is 
slightly inflated 
at this point in 
the season. The 
AFC East has 
four teams that 
are four games 
above even at 
this point in the 
season. Four out 
of five. Most of 
those wins have 
come at the ex
pense of teams 
outside of the di
vision. During 
the remainder of 
the season, these 
four will play one 
another, and the 
records will 
come back to 
Earth. They 
might all finish 
with winning 
records, but they 
wont all be 12- 
4. The remain
ing divisions 
have one or two 
teams apiece 
that are doing 
this well.
There are six 
teams that are
four games below .500. That is 
one team for every division, 
though some divisions are being 
greedy by housing two of these 
lousy teams.
These are teams with as few as 
one win and as many as three. 
Falling that far below even in 
nine or ten games is quite a feat. 
These teams should be com
mended for the futility they have 
shown on the field. Unfortunately 
for their fans, things probably 
wont get any better by the end of 
the year. At least one team has 
probably enjoyed their last vic
tory of the season. It could be 
Cincinnati, Cleveland, or Phila
delphia. It could be one of the 
others. But make no mistake 
about it, these teams are bad.
After looking at the extremes, 
about half of the league is left in
the middle. Of that glut of teams, 
seven have losing records. The 
remaining nine are even or 
slightly better halfway through 
the season. Now that doesnt look 
too bad. Things look pretty spread 
out to me.
It is true that some divisions 
look like they have more parity 
than others. Aside from the AFC 
East, the NFC Central and NFC 
East have teams that are all 
within a few games of each other. 
However, they are not all within 
a few games of other teams 
around the league.
So why are there all the com
plaints about parity? No one has 
been as dominant as last year, 
but there seems to be a good dis
tribution of teams that can win, 
teams that cant, and those in the 
middle. The problem is that too
FiwuI nImugIWvi4lig V4l slihh
many people look at a game or 
two that an average team steals 
from a contender. But that has 
always happened. It always will. 
Thats why they have the sayings 
On any given Sunday and 
Thats why they play the game.
There are no sure things, but 
isnt that better? I think it makes 
each week more exciting, and I 
will take it over what my friends 
call boring college games where 
one team wins by 40 points no 
matter who they play because 
the good teams hardly ever play 
each other anyway.
Nathan Steinwald just hopes 
that when things finally sort them
selves out in the AFC East at the 
end of the season, his Buffalo 
Bills are still one of the 
good teams.
Cant get enough of the Tartans? 
Put your obsession to good use.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  15 November 199911
Ice hockey gets 
last-second win
By ERIN LUCAS
Tartan Staffivriter
Last Friday, Robert Morris College 
; hosted Carnegie Mellon at the Island 
Sports Complex on Neville Island. Rob
ert Morris maintains a very skilled team 
and has always been an extremely chal
lenging opponent for the Tartans. In the 
end, this game proved to be the most 
exciting of the season to date.
For the first half of the opening period, 
Robert Morris clearly dominated, hold
ing the puck in Carnegie Mellon terri
tory seemingly the entire time. Although 
! the Tartans could not get the puck past 
the blue line, they performed very well 
defensively  especially graduate stu
dent goaltender Ryan Henning, who 
made numerous difficult saves. It was 
not until 6:49 of the first period that the 
Tartans managed to get a shot on net. 
Fortunately it was a high-quality shot 
by senior team captain Dan Grosso, who 
buried the puck behind the Robert Mor! ris goaltender. An assist was awarded to 
! first-year center Rob Ready. Carnegie 
i Mellon was in control of the puck for the 
' remainder of the period, although they 
i were unable to score again before the 
end of the first.
The second period was a fast-paced 
and high-scoring 20 minutes of hockey, 
as witnessed by the 4 goals awarded 
during the course of the period. Unfortu
nately for the Tartans, three of the goals 
belonged to Robert Morris. Carnegie 
Mellon struck first on a power play as
Grosso scored his second goal of the 
season with assists from graduate stu
dent Constantine Davides and sopho
more Eliot Minichiello at 10:32. Robert 
Morris answered back, however, with 
two goals in the next two-and-a-half 
minutes of play to tie the game. In the 
last few minutes of play Robert Morris 
was given a two-man advantage as Car
negie Mellon was called for two quick 
penalties, and they scored again to take 
the lead with only 37 seconds remaining 
in the second period.
Robert Morris accounted for six of the 
seven penalties called during the third 
period, most of which were two-minute 
bench minors given to the highly vocal 
Robert Morris coaching staff. Carnegie 
Mellon capitalized on their first power 
play opportunity as Ready scored his 
second goal of the evening unassisted. 
The period continued with strong play 
by both teams. Carnegie Mellons de
fense, anchored by Henning, Minichiello, 
and senior Cliff Brangwynne, kept Rob
ert Morris off the scoreboard for the 
remainder of the period. Just when it 
looked like Carnegie Mellon would have 
to settle for a tie, Davides finished the 
scoring with a beautiful shot with two 
minutes remaining in the third. By the 
end of the game both teams had taken 51 
shots on each others nets. Carnegie 
Mellon left with a 4-3 victory.
Carnegie Mellons last game of the 
season is on November 20 at Neville 
Ice Arena against Washington 
and Jefferson.
Promising season ends 
early for cross country
3U::C3sr h4,w 9i6I DR
The Tartan men went into the meet 
relying on their consistency and team 
balance to pull them through to na
tionals. Behind senior mechanical en
gineering major Kenn Oldham, who 
finished seventh with a time of 
26:21.20, the Tartans remaining scor
ing runners all ended the race within 
18 places of each other. Running as a 
group had been a major strength 
of the mens team all season, and keyed 
many of their season victories. On this 
day, it just wasnt enough, as the com
petition proved to be too much for 
the Tartans.
Senior architecture major James 
Gorham led the pack with his 33rdplace finish (27:06.20), followed by se
nior architecture major Eric Egenolf 
(37th, 27:14.40) and sophomore me
chanical engineering major Matt 
Dennerline (38th, 27:17.70). Round
ing out the Tartans scoring for the 
meet was junior computer science ma
jor Adam Wierman with his 51st-place 
finish (27:31.70).
Since only the top five finishers for 
each time factored into the meet scor
ing, CMUs two final runners were 
competing as potential tie-breakers. 
Senior electrical and computer engi
neering major Bryan Meyer (67th, 
27:53.40) and senior biology major Ryle 
Goodrich (72nd, 27:56.90) completed 
the Tartans day. Had CMU made up 
the seven points on Allegheny, Meyers
and Goodrichs performances would have 
qualified them for nationals. Meyer was 
eight spots ahead of Alleghenys sixth 
runner, and just to be sure, Goodrich 
was three points ahead of the sixth run
ner and 16 points ahead of the seventh 
runner.
The Tartans efforts were not quite 
enough, however, as the team finished a 
mere seven points behind Allegheny 
College, who took the final qualifying 
spot. CMU finished with 166 points to 
Alleghenys 159. Dickinson College fin
ished third with 115 points, 
Elizabethtown College was second with 
107 points, and Haverford College was 
the runaway winner with an astounding 
total of just 63 points. Haverford placed 
four runners in the top 20, and all of 
their runners finished in the top 30 as 
they dominated the meet and were 
never challenged.
The Tartan women had a more diffi
cult time despite placing two finishers 
in the top 10 overall. Sophomore phi
losophy major Brooke Cutler turned in 
CMUs best performance with a fourthplace finish in 18:53.00. Senior com
puter science major Andrea Byrnes was 
not far behind, finishing 10th with a 
time of 19:15.00.
The Tartans problems came from their 
final three runners, however, as their 
next finisher didnt come in until sopho
more chemistry major Kelly Chin crossed 
the line in 48th with a time of 20:21.10. 
Right on Chins heels was first-year stu
dent Katie Aerni, who took 51st in 
20:23.90. Rounding out the Tartans 
score was senior English major Liz 
Currid (89th, 21:04.80). Also running 
for the Tartans were first-year student 
Sonni Abatta (91st, 21:08.90) and senior 
psychology major Melissa Sloan 
(107th, 21:26.10).
The womens score of 202 points was 
just behind the fifth-place score of 
Franklin and Marshall College (198), 
but well off the pace of the final national 
qualifier Western Maryland College, who 
finished with 165 points. Messiah Col
lege took third with 142 points, Moravian 
College was second with 117, and 
Dickinson College won easily with 71 
points. Dickinson dominated the field as 
much as Haverford did in the mens 
race, placing all five scoring runners in 
the top 20, and their sixth and seventh 
runners 33rd and 52nd.
Though neither team qualified for the 
national meet, both had individual run
ners earn trips to the national meet. By 
finishing in the top 10 at the regional 
meet, Oldham, Cutler, and Byrnes each 
earned the right to run at nationals in 
Madison, Wisconsin on November 20.
Sending the individuals to the meet 
was little consolation to the teams, who 
had grown accustomed to success at the 
regional level and more competition at 
the national level. After placing in the 
top five at nationals last year, not quali
fying was especially heartbreaking for 
the women.Tartans improve as fall season winds down

The last event CMU entered 
was the mens varsity 4+ race, 
and as the day progressed, the 
Tartans continued to improve, 
j Racing in a 16-boat field with a 
j brand-new boat, the crew pulled 
away early and held on to win the 
race by 10 seconds. The crew, 
comprised of junior business ma
jor Dave Clumpner, senior de
sign major Jeff Beene, junior ar
chitecture major Neil Stroup, and 
senior design major Greg 
Niejadlik, finished with a time of 
17:25.92, outpacing Mary Wash
ington, who finished second 
in 17:35.48.
Following their success at the 
Head of the Occoquan, the club
o,b4lIec i4gI6uI TItt,g 3,ug6 tby 
The crew club has had one of its best seasons ever, performing above 
expectations in every event theyve entered.
entered three boats in the Head 
of the South Regatta in Augusta, 
Georgia on November 13. The 
travel distance to the event added 
to what already was going to be a 
tough meet.
The team left for Georgia on 
Thursday night, and after an 11- 
hour van ride, got to rest for a few 
hours, and then practice for the 
race the next day, Hanczar said.
The mens novice 4+ crew re
bounded from their performance 
the week before to overcome the 
field and equipment failure to 
take third in their six-boat field. 
Starting in the last stagger posi
tion, the team had already passed 
one boat when one of the seats in 
their boat came loose, costing the 
crew a great deal of time." After 
dropping momentarily behind, 
the team amazingly recovered to 
get back into the race and finish 
in 21:36.77, eight seconds ahead 
of Augusta St. University. The 
equipment mishaps cost the Tar
tans a shot at the leaders, how
ever, as Rollins College and the
Tulane Rowing Association led 
the pack with times of 18:55.29 
and 19:12.16, respectively.
Following the mens inspiring 
performance, the womens club 
4+ crew entered the heavyweight 
category and managed to take 
seventh out of the 16 boats. Rac
ing against women that were 
much larger than they were, they 
did well, Hanczar said. In fact,
in the lightweight race, the time 
would have received fourth place. 
Looking to finish the day on a 
high note, the womens light
weight 4+ crew went out eager to 
turn in a good performance. They 
did that and more, winning the 
event by holding off Robert Mor
ris by 49 seconds. The crew of 
graduate student Susan 
Lawrence, sophomore H&SS stu
dent Meghan Hajek, senior biol
ogy major Ann Bradley, sopho
more mathematics major Trista 
Stearns, and junior coxswain 
Laura Miyakawa turned in a time 
of 20:23.32 to get the win. Rob
ert Morris has finished consis
tently ahead of our womens team, 
so it was very impressive to beat 
them by such a significant 
amount, Hanczar said.

However, Thomas More Col- Carnegie Mellon regained the

Thomas More quarterback to

up by sophomore Mark Reiner at 
Thomas Mores 24-yard line.
After that pleasant surprise, 
sophomore Eric Zimpher threw 
the ball to senior Mike 
McLaughlin to score a touchdown 
for the Tartans. Senior Chris 
was successful, 
tying the game 
at 7-7 near the 
end of the first 
quarter. The 
Tartans pro
ceeded to stop 
the Thomas

before the end 
of the quarter.

The remainder of the first half 
was more of the same, with Tho

stopped by the excellent Carn

tans being unable to move the 
ball as well. The second quarter 
ended with the ball in the posses
sion of Carnegie Mellon after a 
turnover with 17 seconds left in 
the half.
Thomas More opened the sec
ond half with a 35-yard drive 
that was abruptly stopped when 
junior Jared Winchester forced a 
fumble and then recovered the 
ball for Carnegie Mellon. The 
Tartans rushed for six plays but 
were forced to punt. The Tartans 
dwindling hopes for a victory were 
shattered as Thomas More re
sponded with a long series of pass
ing plays that led to their second 
touchdown, making the 
score 147.
Carnegie Mellon received the 
ball but was unable to answer 
with a score of their own, return
ing possession to Thomas More 
after a six-minute drive. The third 
quarter ended after several failed 
attempts by Thomas More to ad

As the fourth quarter began,

Carnegie Mellon attempted to

score a field goal and then soon 
afterwards another touchdown, 
leading to the final score of 23-7.
Overall, Carnegie Mellon and 
Thomas More had almost equal 
times of possession, but while
Carnegie Mellon produced con
sistently strong rushing plays and 
a tough rushing defense, Thomas

several long passing plays and a 
tight defense.
The Tartans ended the 99 sea

wait and see if their record is 
good enough to qualify them for

Making a splash.

Tartan Sports Editor
In what should have been just 
another step on the way to their 
, ultimate goal, both the mens 
I and womens cross country 
i teams had their seasons cut 
short last Saturday at the 
NCAA Division III Mideast Re
gional meet.
Though both teams ran well, 
they were unable to break into 
the top four finishing positions 
that earned berths in the NCAA 
national championship meet. 
The men finished fifth, just 
missing nationals, while the 
women were only able to man
age sixth. While these are cer
tainly respectable results for the 
Tartans, they were disappoint
ing finishes for a pair of teams 
that finished 14th and fourth in 
last years national champion
ship meet, respectively.

Rowers save best performances for last
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
After turning their best perfor
mance ever at one of the biggest 
regattas in the country, the Head 
of the Charles in Boston, the CMU 
crew club continued their impres
sive season with another strong 
showing, this time at the Head of
the Occoquan Regatta in Fairfax 
Station, Virginia.
The Tartans entered six boats 
in the meet, competing in the 
mens novice 8+, mens varsity 
4+, womens novice 8+, and 
womens championship 44- 
events. Three of the six crews 
took third place or better, and all 
six had some of their best times.

The teams performances last 
season were probably the best we 
have ever done at this particular 
regatta, said club public rela
tions director Alexys Hanczar.
The days opening race was the 
womens novice 8+ event. The race 
was a close contest featuring a 
whopping 21 boats. The competi
tion was tough, including tradi
tionally strong 
crews from the 
University of 
Pittsburgh, Vir
ginia Tech, the 
University of 
Maryland, Rob
ert Morris, and 
St. Johns. The 
CMU crew had 
a good race, but 
their time of 
21:55.53 was 
only good 
enough for an 
18th-place fin
ish. CMU had a 
solid hold on 
the spot, though, 
beating Ameri-.
can University by six seconds, 
Old Dominion by 10 seconds, and 
one of Pitts entrants by 40 sec
onds. The victory went to Pitts 
A boat, with Robert Morris tak
ing second.
Following the women was the 
mens novice 8+ race, in which 
CMU enjoyed a bit more success. 
The crew earned the Tartans first 
medal of the day with a thirdplace finish. CMUs time of 
18:02.63just edged out the fourthplace crew from Virginia Tech 
(18:04.50), but was well behind 
the pace set by the leaders. Rob
ert Morris ran away with the 
event, winning with a time of 
17:00.30, and Johns Hopkins took 
second in 17:40.17.
Following the success of the 
mens novice 8+ crew, the mens 
novice 4+ crew suffered a more 
disappointing finish. The crew 
was unable to get on track, and 
took eighth out of nine boats.
After the two mens events, the

HEINZ IN PITTSBURGHFacts
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
I will do the common thing, 
uncommonly well, said Henry 
John Heinz II about his food 
processing company, and that 
is exactly what he did since he 
was just 8 years old, growing 
up with his parents just out
side of Pittsburgh. Henry was 
born in 1844 in a small house 
in Sharpsburg. While his 
mother Anna had always 
planned for him to be a minis
ter, it was clear early on that 
Henrys passions lay in the 
garden. When Henry was 8, he 
was peddling vegetables from 
his mothers small garden to 
neighbors and friends with 
great success. By the time he 
was 12, his mother had given 
him three acres of land for him 
to garden. Henry then began to 
sell horseradish and vegeta
bles out of a small cart. Even 
from his early days as an 
entrepreneur, Henry wanted to 
make sure that his customers 
got only the purest foods.
Henrys first venture into the 
world of business was not a 
successful one. In 1869 Heinz 
joined forces with L. Clarence 
Noble to form Heinz, Noble & 
Co. Heinz insisted that all of 
his products be packaged in 
clear glass to show off the puri
ty and freshness of his foods. 
According to Heinz Historian 
Ed Lehew, a former advertis
ing executive for the company, 
Heinz did all this in a time 
when other food producers

Brief History
1844  Henry John Heinz is born.
1866HJ. Heinz begins to successfully peddle pro
duce from his familys garden in Sharpsburg.
1869  H.J. Heinz and partner L. Clarence Noble 
launch Heinz & Noble, laying the foundation for 
todays global company. The first product was Heinzs 
mothers superior grated horseradish.
*875  Heinzs first company goes bankrupt. H. J.

tually the only one in the industry to support it, the 
Pure Food and Drug Act is passed.
1919  Howard Heinz, son of Henry, begins to lead 
the company. He refuses to burden the company with 
debt during the speculative 1920s.

Heinz Botde History 
Keystone style 1876-1883:
- Heinz Ketchup, or Catsup as it was called 
at the time, was introduced by Heinz in 
1876. The Keystone bottle, made by Heinz' 
own bottle manufacturing facility, was 
named for its resemblance to Pennsylvanias 
keystone symbol. The keystone was also one 
of Heinz trademarks.
- The label was printed in color by the stone 
plate method. There were more than 15 col
ors in the original label, which featured a 
sailboat on one side and children fishing on 
the other.
Handsome style 1883-1905:
- The Handsome period was the only time 
that the Heinz Ketchup label was not a key
stone die cut.
- The Handsome ketchup bottle was the 
first to be mass-produced.
Octagon style 1888-1995:
- Prior to the onset of this style, H.J. Heinz
personally designed all the bottles.
- With the introduction of the Octagon 
style, the product was spelled "Ketchup." 
Imperial style i889-I9i3:
- The four edges of the bottle were 
embossed with a design that was similar to 
baseball stitching.
- The bottle, which held 17 ounces of 
ketchup, was said to be the best-designed 
bottle by designers of the time. However, 
the bottle was too expensive to make and was 
discontinued.
- Until 191O, all bottles were produced by 
hand at Heinz' own glassmaking company. 
That year, the facility burned down, and all 
subsequent Heinz Ketchup bottles were 
produced by machinery.
Octagon style 1914-1943:
- Heinz Ketchup was the first product in 
the United States to bear the Pure Food 
label. The label was attached on the shoul
der of the bottle. The Pure Food label was
displayed on Heinz Ketchup bottles 
until 1939.
- The Octagon style was the first bottle to 
hold 14 ounces of Heinz Ketchup, which is 
Heinz' standard glass bottle size today. 
Octagon style I944-Prcaent:
- Since the bottle style was never copyright
ed by Heinz, several competitors wanted to 
use the octagon style bottle for their prod
uct. Heinz decided to emboss the bottle 
with its trademark "57" and competitors 
backed off their idea.
Plastic style 1983-present:
- The style is similar to the Octagon style 
with its flat sides and eight paneled arches.
- Heinz introduced plastic squeezable bot
tles about a year-and-a-half before its com
petitors.
- The plastic bottles have a flip-top lid 
rather than a screw-on lid.
- New labels arc introduced in 1999 to target youger audience.

Last Wednesday, a full audience in 
the University Centers McKenna, 
Peter, and Wright rooms gathered to 
hear Dr. Kevin Danaher, a member of 
the San Francisco-based human rights 
and anti-globalization activist group 
Global Exchange. Danaher, sporting an 
eracism t-shirt, discussed how 
exploitative economic policies are exac
erbating world poverty and the misdistribution of wealth overall to cata
strophic proportions.
He diagrammed a typical instance of 
trade between countries as two pyra
mids, with all the connecting lines 
between them at the top. When coun
tries trade, Danaher said, the process 
can be more accurately described as a 
trade existing only between their elite, 
with the rest of the pyramids repre
senting controlled labor and public 
property. He learned this crucial lesson 
when he traveled to Africa on a mission 
to alleviate poverty; Danaher then real
ized that such abject conditions were 
the result of institutionalized mass 
exploitation, which could only be 
reformed from the top down.
He argued that the governing ideolo
gy behind todays global economic sys
tem is essentially imperial. In the zeal 
to maximize short-term profits, he said, 
all other values are laid aside, such as 
that 30,000 children do not deserve to 
die from hunger every day (a conserv
ative estimate) when plenty of food is 
available. Consequently, power struc
tures develop to leverage control over 
public resources  a fundamental con
tradiction to the principles of freedom 
and democracy. Danaher even chal
lenged the audience to consider, our 
own university as an imperial struc
ture, as corporate regents make deci
sions concerning its fate, while stu
dents, faculty, and most of the staff 
hold no meaningful authority. Danaher 
also delineated the corporate corrupcontents of which were described as 
advertising and the news hole. 
Danahers simple proposal was that 
corporate structures are irreconcilable 
with democratic ones, and we must opt 
for the latter.
His most immediate point of con
tention was on the practice and very 
existence of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), established in 
1995 to enforce the General Agreement
B4cig !i9tigWti4lig !g,l, liul,4 
!Imug nigidI4 uttbel4ilIe i 9,ugl pb4ug6 due litS tiel 0IpgIepic2
tion of the media. Since the news 
medias primary income is derived from 
advertising, the real product being sold 
is its audience. Thus, depraved con
sumerism and enforcement of the sta
tus quo are the medias main triumphs. 
He alluded to his own experience work
ing on the layout of a newspaper, the
on Tariffs and Trade. The WTO, 
Danaher revealed, has ruled consis
tently in favor of transnational corpo
rations, against the benefit of the inter
national public. Such corporations have 
used the WTO to nullify labor stan
dards as well as crucial environmental 
and health regulations in the interest
of free trade, which Danaher coun
tered with an ideology of fair trade/ 
His organization has proposed a sys
tem by which consumers only buy prod
ucts that have been grown or manufac
tured with standards that the WTO 
and existing policies disregard.
Danaher balanced his sobering facts 
with jokes that had the audience 
chuckling often, as well as the opti
mistic message that activism has won 
some ground. Examples included the 
heavy concessions of the tobacco indus
try, and a successful lawsuit against 
clothing companies that utilize sweat
shop labor. A British court recently 
found McDonalds to be guilty of brain
washing children, depressing the retail 
sector overall, and abusing animals. 
By supporting alternative economic 
institutions and the reform of the glob
al economy, Danaher said, progress can 
be made.
He said that though residents of 
the Third World often come to mind 
when we think of overpopulation, it 
is in fact the powerful industrialized 
nations that consume most of the 
resources, to an immensely destruc
tive end. He compared the global 
economy to a drunk bus driver 
leading us over a cliff. However, 
there will be a WTO summit in 
Seattle from November 30 to 
December 3. We can hunker down in 
our seats like those who let the 
Holocaust and the slave trade occur, 
or, Danaher implored, we can act to 
abolish and replace this corrupt 
institution and its bullshit.

A computer science major 
who acts? Thats what youll 
find when you meet sophomore 
Mayhew Seavey III. Seavey 
resides in the town of Milton, 
Massachusetts, where he 
attended high school at Milton 
Academy. Seavey, in addition 
to being interested in acting, he 
is an avid movie fan, and has 
produced several of his own 
movies with friends at Milton. 
Recently, The Tartan sat down 
with Seavey for a conversation 
about his interests in acting.
The Tartan: Why did you 
choose CMU?
Mayhew Seavey III: Well, 
because I didnt get into a lot of 
better schools. Also, because I 
was interested in specifically 
doing some sort of mixture of 
computer science and drama 
stuff. CMU is really strong in 
art, in addition to the technical 
side. I knew that computer 
stuff would be what I would be 
doing as a career, but I had 
always loved getting into drama 
and other art forms as well.
TT: Would your acquain
tances be surprised to find out 
that you like to act?
MS: I think it depends where 
I know them from. If they 
dont know me and just know 
me as just a computer science 
sophomore then theyd defi
nitely be surprised. In Scotch 
n Soda, people are actually 
surprised that Im a computer 
science major, but I dont know 
if anyone has been really 
been surprised the other 
way. I guess I have a dram
atic personality.
TT: What is it about your 
background before you 
came to CMU that spawned 
this interest?
MS: Im not really even sure 
how I got into acting. I guess I 
just started doing it. We did 
some plays in the lower grades 
in elementary school, and I 
enjoyed them. It was a way to 
get out of sports in high school. 
It started out that way but I 
really started to love delving 
into characters and making 
myself a totally different per
son. I did two summers worth 
of acting workshops. Those 
were two of my most enjoyable
summers ever and I wanted to 
keep that up.
TT: What is it about Scotch 
n Soda that makes it so easy 
to get involved?
MS: Last year I saw signs for 
auditions for Arcadia. I had 
seen Arcadia before and I real
ly liked the show. Scotch n
Soda. It was the first time I 
had arrived, and I got a part. 
Its a very friendly atmosphere. 
Everyone in Scotch n Soda is 
very close and accepting of all 
sorts of members  computer 
science, H&SS, whatever. I 
really liked that its tight and 
you can make a lot of good

Soda wasnt discriminating friends there, 
against people who had done TT: How is the current pro
lots of plays before and who duction been going? 
were big members of Scotch n MS: I think it has gone very
well. Ive had more fun on this 
one than the previous one. This 
is a comedy, so a lot of the actors 
that have come to it have been 
comic actors. So even when we 
mess up its still funny. Its come 
along surprisingly well. It was a 
little slow towards the beginning 
like most shows, but it has really 
come together and a lot 
of the comic moments 
have solidified.
TT: What would you say to 
other people in technical 
majors who may feel a pro
duction is not for them 
because they assume 
the people involved are 
more artistic?
MS: In terms of Scotch n 
Soda, thats one of our biggest 
philosophies, because most of 
the really artistic people are 
already in the drama school. 
So basically if there is that 
artistic longing in you, doing 
plays would be a good outlet 
from all the boring technical 
stuff we have to do. We actual
ly have a lot of technical people 
doing tech stuff on the set. 
However, sometimes many of 
them do tech and sometimes do 
acting too.

were packaging their foods in brown 
bottles to hide imperfections and addi
tives such as nuts and bolts.
Six years later, though, Heinz and 
Noble were in economic trouble 
because of miscalculations by Noble 
and a deepening recession in the 
United States. Heinz would not accept 
failure, and soon he founded his second 
company, H.J. Heinz Company, which 
is still in business today. Henry decided 
that he would only go into business 
with family members, and his philoso
phy turned out to work. H.J. Heinz 
Company blossomed. Most of its early 
history is dotted with Heinzs great 
culinary innovations  he made everyi thing from peanut butter, to apple pre
serves, to ketchup, which was added to 
the product line in 1876.. In fact, Heinz 
was the inventor of modern ketchup.
In 1886 Heinz began his worldwide 
expansion, which is still continuing 
today. One of Heinzs most important 
business decisions was to expand into 
, the^ United Kingdom, which is one of 
Heinzs largest markets today  in 
fact, there was a time when Britons 
believed that Heinz was a local compa
ny that expanded to the United States, 
rather than the other way around. 
Heinzs start in England was small. On 
a trip to Britain, he visited Londons 
famous Fortnum and Mason to try to 
sell them at least some of his food 
products. He walked into Fortnum and 
Mason and said, Id like to see the 
head buyer. When he was asked by the 
clerk who he was, Heinz responded, I 
am Mr. Heinz, and I am from 
Pittsburgh, USA, and Id like to sell you 
; some of my products. Much to Heinzs
surprise, Fortnum and Mason bought 
his entire range of food products, 
and Heinzs presence in the UK 
was secured.
Heinzs business strategy did not just 
include overseas expansion plans  he 
was also committed to his employees. 
After seeing the devastation that the 
railroad strikes caused, he was more 
determined than ever to make sure his 
employees were content. Through 
building a modern factory with rooftop 
gardens, swimming pools, manicures 
for women employees, doctors, and live 
music at lunch, Heinz proved to the 
world that it was possible to run a suc
cessful business while having a happy 
workforce. Heinzs new factory was a 
model for others to emulate, and Heinz 
went one step further by introducing 
the factory tour which saw 20,000 peo
ple pass through his factory in the first 
year alone.
If one drives by the factory today, 
many of the original building still exist, 
all adorned with Heinzs famous 57. 
Even though Heinz has over 5,000 vari
eties today, they have kept the 57 logo 
which Henry came up with after seeing 
an advertisement for shoes. At the 
time, Heinz had 60 varieties and he 
ordered Heinz executives to compress 
the list to 57. Heinz enjoyed great pros
perity with his new advertising logo 
and was enjoying life until his wife sud
denly died early in the 20th century. 
The Heinz familys dedication to com
munity-oriented service took off when 
Henry built a safe house for 
Pittsburgh youth in memory of 
his wife.
Starting with H.J. Heinz II, the 
Heinzes became important as philan
thropists with a dedication to 
Southwest Pennsylvania, said Mark 
Kamlet, dean of the H.J. Heinz III 
School at CMU. Jack Heinz was a key 
part of the Pittsburgh renaissance with 
a city going from being a dirty grimy 
city to its position today.
While Heinz was expanding in 
Pittsburgh beyond the confines of the 
business world, the company was push
ing forward on all six inhabited conti
nents. Even before Coca-Cola and 
McDonalds became global icons repre
senting America, Heinz was selling his 
foods in far off places such as Africa. 
The whole time Heinz heralded the 
companys commitment to pure food. It 
was a dedication that almost cost 
Heinz his company. After Upton 
Sinclairs book The Jungle was pub
lished, the food processing industry 
came under fire. Heinz was the only 
company to support the Pure Food and 
Drug Act, and Henry was branded as a 
traitor and threatened with death by 
his competitors. However the Act did 
pass in 1906, and Heinz triumphed.
Heinz had a big impact. It was one 
of the biggest employers in the region 
for.the better part of the last century, 
said Kamlet.
The H.J. Heinz company continued 
its spectacular growth, even through 
the Great Depression. In 1933 
Howard Heinz was able to say that 
the Heinz Company had increased its 
workforce by 60 percent in a time 
when many companies were going 
bust. Heinz charged ahead, and even 
stood out during the Second World 
War. Before the U.S. began its 
involvement with the war, Henry 
gave $80,000 to England to buy such
items as Spitfire fighter planes. 
When America finally did join the 
war effort, the Pittsburgh plant on 
the banks of the Allegheny River 
began to make wooden gliders in the 
same factories where it made its 
famous ketchup. Heinz made gliders 
that were used in the successful DDay invasion at Normandy.
The next 50 years of Heinzs history 
was much like its first 50, marked by 
further global expansion and great eco
nomic growth. Today Heinz stands as 
one of Pittsburghs greatest companies, 
known around the world. People are 
very loyal to [Heinz] in Pittsburgh. 
Heinz is known as a Pittsburgh compa
ny the world over, said Lehew.

Gripe About OLR Week, also known in some 
circles, but none that I belong to, as registration.
Registration is strategically placed at the exact 
moment when everyone has reached the break
ing point in the classes that they have been 
struggling with all semester. When we receive 
that course catalogue with next semesters class
es, it is like receiving a key to'salvation. Sure, I 
have to deal with Stupid-Class-with-NoRelevance-to-My-Life right now, but next semes
ter I can take SuperStupendo-Class-with-theWorlds-Best-Teacher. And its offered from 1:30 
to 3:00 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Bonus!
But too often these hopes begin to fade as we 
sit down at the computer and are inundated by 
one of the more disheartening words in the 
English language: Waitlist. It is easy to blame 
this frustrating experience on the registration 
system, in this case Online Registration. But I 
dont believe that that is entirely fair.
Sure, when OLR began three years ago it had 
some problems. Namely the fact that it took 
hours to register for classes. Clearly CMU under
estimated their normally apathetic student body 
and just assumed that not everyone would wake 
up at 6 am to register. Unfortunately, everyone 
did. I know that my roommate and I were so 
frustrated that year by the systems slow screen 
loading time that it was only by watching 
Sesame Street, and continuously proclaiming our 
love for Big Bird, that we maintained our sanity. 
And that sort of depravity clearly should not 
have occurred.
But at least we got to groan and yell from our 
bedroom, in our pajamas. Had we been enrolled 
at CMU only a year earlier, the registration sys
tem would have been such that even Big Bird 
could not save us. Before OLR, in order to regis
ter for classes you actually had to go to each 
department to sign up for each class. Majors got 
to sign up at their departments a day earlier. 
And if you were undeclared? In the words of one 
current senior who witnessed this archaic 
process, Well, then you were screwed.
Departments opened at 8 am, but if there 
was a class that you really wanted then you 
got there hours earlier and just waited. If you 
went later in the morning, then you still had 
to wait for hours, this time in seemingly 
unending lines. And you would have to go 
through this every time you wanted to sign up 
for a class in a different department. 
Surprisingly, almost no one attended class on 
registration days.
Now, because of OLR, registration takes about 
15 minutes and, with our new wireless network, 
you can literally do it anywhere. Thats quite an 
improvement over both the old system and the 
OLR system that existed when I first enrolled 
here. The main difference from the latter is that, 
because students registration times are stag
gered over the course of the whole day, the serv
er is not as bogged down and can service each 
student significantly faster.
Some have complained that this system of ran
domly assigning start times based on social secu
rity numbers is unfair. They say that those who 
put forth the effort to wake up early should get 
into the classes that they want. And in a perfect 
world, this would be true. But we all know what 
happens without the randomization, dont we? 
Thats right, Big Bird!
While randomization is an imperfect system, I 
would rather get the whole thing over with in fifteen 
minutes than waste an entire day because the sys
tem is processing at the rate of one screen change 
per hour. I am not saying this because I have always 
gotten an ideal start time. Last semester I had the 
worst possible start time and was waitlisted for 
classes even within my major because of it.
This is why I believe that it is misguided for 
students to complain about OLR. OLR is a fast, 
easy, and efficient system, which the HUB is still 
trying to refine every year. What we should real
ly be complaining about is that, for a private 
school of this caliber, there are far too many peo
ple who cannot get into the classes that they 
want or need.
Sometimes there is a particular teacher that 
everyone wants, which makes it difficult to get 
into a class, and until we can clone people there 
is not much to be done about that. But usually, 
students are waitlisted because CMU simply 
does not offer enough sections of a particular 
subject or class each year.
A few examples: There is at most one film class 
offered every semester. Science, Technology, and 
the Environment, the only H&SS interdiscipli
nary science class, is only offered once a year. 
Decision Analysis & Decision Support Systems, 
and Application Design & Development, two 
mandatory classes for IDS majors, are each only 
offered once a year. Im sure that every one of us 
know of others.
The answer? Hire more professors. There are 
an abundance of overeducated people out there 
in the world just waiting to be given the oppor
tunity to teach us for a pittance. Why wont you 
let them? I know that CMU has a lot of other 
things to spend its money on, like tearing up 
trees, but really I think that we would appreciate 
it a lot more if you would just spend it on getting 
us more teachers.
Registration does not have to be a harrowing 
experience, and the OLR system makes it as 
painless as possible. But no matter how quick 
and efficient a course registration system is, it 
will never be seen that way as long as it quickly 
and efficiently tells you that you are on yet 
another waitlist.

Dr. Paul Rozin, a ketchupologist and psychology professor

lengths they will go to get it out

That is perhaps your first

pleasure of eating.
I grew up on this sauce, and 
whenever I ate it, I inevitably

fire gutted the bottle-making

ketchups history is anything 
but typical. Henry Heinz invent
ed ketchup in 1876 after one of 
his numerous trips to England. 
Heinz found a sauce called 
Catsup in England that was 
made with fish, rather than 
tomatoes. Heinz decided that he 
was going to substitute the fish 
with tomatoes and catsup quick
ly became ketchup, the worlds 
favorite condiment.
Heinz Ketchup, according to 
Heinz historian Ed Lehew, 
stands out above its competitors 
on several fronts. According to 
Lehew it began in the late 1800s 
when Heinz packaged its 
ketchup in clear bottles to show 
to consumers that the sauce was 
pure and without additives. In
ketchup has always featured 
natural ingredients. According 
to the Heinz company, words 
people associate with the red 
sauce include thick, red, 
and tomato.
One of Heinz Ketchups most 
unique aspects is its worldwide 
popularity. Made and sold 
around the world, Heinz ketchup 
can now be found in such coun
tries as Italy, England, Ireland, 
China, Saudi Arabia, and India, 
to name just a few. What it is 
exactly about Heinz ketchup 
that makes it so popular around 
the world will probably always 
remain a mystery, but perhaps 
the fact that it is the only condi
ment that can be eaten by itself 
in large quantities is explana

By BLAKE ENGEL
Tartan Assistant Production Manager
Its a phenomenon. If Peter Stearns had only 
one thing to say in his talk last Thursday about
25 years from now. How could we ever expect to 
predict the one of 1000 years from now?
Stearns posed the question of how future histo
rians will reflect on this time in history. Certainly 
our desire to hoard rations will be of interest.
Anthony DAuria/Tartan Photo Staff 
nIig slIi4ge 4ItilIe due ,9ugu,ge igp hIItug6e ,g ldI o,wug6 wuttIggubw odig6I2
the coming new millennium, that is it: Fear of the 
new year may be in our heads, it may be real, but 
it is scientifically explainable.
The phenomenon, Stearns said, is based almost 
completely on the Christian calendar. The 
Christian church is especially partial to measur
ing time in powers of ten (what would have hap
pened if we had nine fingers?). In contrast to this, 
when Islam celebrated its 1000-year anniversary 
400 years ago, Muslims didnt flinch.
Stearns said our angst is unnecessary. For 
example: Jesus was born between 7 and 3 B.C., so 
weve survived the 2000-year mark since Christs 
birth. Furthermore, the year zero did not exist, so 
the millennium truly begins in 2001. And when 
the'calendar rolled over to the magical year 1000 
(the year of apocalypse mentioned in the New 
Testament book of Revelation), hardly a soul bat
ted an eye for a simple reason: The Gregorian cal
endar was not used at the time.
So if not now, when? If only the church or the 
state would step in and tell us when this will all 
happen! Clearly this is not an option, according to 
Stearns. Organizations like the Catholic Church 
refuse to commit themselves to a date. Some have 
already tried to pin the apocalypse to the years 
between 1997 and 2004  only to occasionally 
tack a year or two onto the end of the span to save 
face when it doesnt happen.
This is obviously a societal problem, but 
Stearns said that retired Christian engineers are 
to carry a good amount of the blame. Who else has 
so much time to ponder numbers like, for 
instance, 2000, and to do so without considering 
any social implications whatsoever?
Besides, he added, we try to predict the world of
Thousands have quit their jobs and assembled 
Y2K survival packs. Most of these people happen 
to be Americans.
Also noteworthy, according to Stearns, of this 
time is the commercialism attached to the chang
ing of the millennium. Plastic surgeons com
mand: Get your body ready for the
new millennium!
Many religious groups, particularly cults, 
swear by a dire view of what is to come. Such 
groups could cause a self-fulfilling prophecy and 
make an event out of a non-event, Stearns said.
And dont forget the race to have the socalled Millennium Baby, a notion Stearns 
called deplorable.
To explain our extreme anxiety, Stearns offered 
the passing of the Cold War as a possible source. 
Subconsciously, he said, Americans miss that 
near-half-century period in our history and being 
able to direct animosity, hostility, and mistrust 
toward the USSR. Combined with the Y2K fiasco 
and Americans resentment of technology, the mil
lennium panic makes a near-perfect substitute 
for Iron Curtain mistrust.
The talk was not without Stearnss trademark 
biting humor: For centuries, Europeans who were 
persecuted for their beliefs in a nearing 
Judgment Day have flooded to the country of 
unending possibility: America. With a tendency 
to choose California, Stearns added.
And as for the aftermath? Well be sufficiently 
embarrassed, said Steams. All the money, all the 
hype, all the extremists  in retrospect, we will 
seem pretty silly to ourselves, and we will most like
ly return to our posts in life  at least until 2001, 
when the millennium actually turns over.

public policy, promoting this diversity 
has been an important focus of the 
school since its founding.
Weve always had a big emphasis on 
making sure the student body was 
diverse, both in terms of women and 
underrepresented minorities, said 
Kamlet. [Diversity] is something that 
Carnegie Mellon has recently put a big 
emphasis on, but it is something that 
[the Heinz School] has been pushing for 
a while.
Students currently enrolled in the 
Heinz School agree that the diversity of 
the school has greatly contributed 
to the quality of their edu
cational experience.
If I were in China, all the people 
would be the same, and there would not 
be much diversity. Here I have to inter
act with students from everywhere. I 
must understand their culture and be 
able to communicate with them, said 
Chunyam Ma, a student originating 
frpm China currently enrolled in the 
Masters of Information Systems 
Management program.
Yvette Gerrans, a current student in 
the Masters of Science in Public Policy 
and Management program, agreed. I 
think one of the pluses [of the Heinz 
School] is all the international students 
here. It teaches you to work in a more 
global environment, which is some
thing well all need to do, she said.
This notion of working together to 
solve problems dates back to the 
schools inception and is key to its pri
mary goal of preparing students to do 
public service and deal with policy 
issues, according to Kamlet.
In the late 1960s, there was a lot of 
concern in American cities. It was a
time of race riots and lots of urban 
problems. It was felt that there should 
be a way to do research on these prob
lems, such as poverty, housing, and 
health care, said Kamlet. It was felt 
that there should be a training ground 
for people who would go out and work 
for government and do public service 
and address these problems.
After receiving a 10-million-dollar 
endowment from Richard King Mellon, 
the school was formed as the School of 
Urban and Public Affairs and graduat
ed its first class in 1972. In addition to 
Mellons contribution, the Heinz family 
has been a consistent contributor to the 
school since its founding and Senator 
H. J. Heinz III had served on the 
schools board of visitors. According to 
Kamlet, when the senator was killed in 
a 1992 helicopter accident, the school 
was renamed in recognition of the role 
he played in the school and in the sur
rounding area.
The Heinz School today is clearly 
considered one of the countrys most 
distinguished schools, said Kamlet, 
who said that U.S. News and World 
Report rankings provide evidence of the 
schools success. Last year, out of 250 
schools of public affairs nationally, the 
Heinz school ranked fourth in Policy 
Analysis, first in Information 
Technology, and in the top 10 in a vari
ety of other categories.
While the school is primarily a gradu
ate school, it interacts with undergradu
ates in a number of ways. For example, 
it offers a minor in Health Management 
in conjunction with MCS and H&SS. In 
addition, a number of undergraduates 
take advantage of the Accelerated 
Masters Program, whereby they can 
earn both a bachelors and a masters

Though you may not know it, 
Carnegie Mellon has 
quite a presence at the 
Heinz Corporation.
Several former CMU stu
dents have chosen to work 
down by the Allegheny river 
for Heinz. Jeff Beaman, who 
graduated last May from 
GSIA, is now an associate 
brand manager for ketchup at 
Heinz. We do consumer mar
keting for ketchup. Beaman 
said his daily responsibilities 
include budgeting and work
ing with the ad agency in 
order to promote the product. 
Its definitely exciting work
ing on the companys flagship 
product, he said. The current 
advertising campaign for 
ketchup is focused on teens 
and kids and will run until 
April of 2000.
Heinz recruits in small num
bers each year from GSIA. 
According to Beaman, there are 
usually one or two positions 
open each year for 
GSIA students.
Were trying to change stu
dents opinions that it is an old 
factory across the river, said
Beaman. One way that the cor
poration hopes to update 
Heinzs image is to bring 
Starkist Tuna and Heinz 
Petfood to Pittsburgh, which 
will make the Heinz area more 
campus-like. Recently there 
was speculation as to how com
mitted to Pittsburgh Heinz is, 
when it had problems expand
ing its operations in the city 
and hinted at the possibility of 
relocating. Its public record 
that Heinz is definitely 
committed to Pittsburgh, 
said Beaman.
A1 Banisch, the general 
manager for global condi
ments and sauces, graduated 
from GSIA in 1988, and also 
received an industrial man
agement undergraduate 
degree in 1983. In general, 
Banisch facilitates and cat
alyzes communication across 
geographic regions. Heinz has 
a presence in most major con
tinents, from Latin America 
to Asia. He said his job entails 
three major types of activi
ties: Organic Growth,
Expansion, and Supply 
Chain. Specifics include 
bringing Heinzs condiments 
and sauces into new regions, 
insuring conformity of high
quality, and looking at acquir
ing new holdings for Heinz.
Aaron Schwartz graduated 
from CMU in 1985 with a B.S. 
in material sciences and from 
GSIA in 1990. He is the associ
ate brand manager for College 
Inn, a division of the H. J. Heinz 
Company. Schwartz works in 
the marketing department, and 
manages the business for soups 
and nuts. He said that the 
skills that have helped him 
most [that he acquired from 
GSIA] are working in teams 
and analytical skills. Heinz is 
a very analytical company and 
thats something you get a lot of 
training in at GSIA, he said. 
Banisch said that the presenta
tion skills he learned at GSIA 
have also helped him a lot, as 
has the management 
game process.
Schwartz, Beaman, and 
Banisch agreed that the rela
tionship between Heinz and 
GSIA is currently strong.
Banisch said when in the 
market for MBA students, 
GSIA graduates are almost 
always at the top of the compa
nys list. It will only become 
stronger as Heinz expands on 
its marketing initiatives, 
said Beaman.

S
o there I was, aboard the alien spaceship. A small green creature 
approached me, and began to speak in strange syllabic beeps. 
When I didnt understand, the creature seemed to become angry and 
raised a weapon. I immediately leapt forward and incapacitated the 
little dude. Listen here, Zippy, I said, where I come from, we 
have a little game called Space Invaders. To make a long story short, 
I eventually won my freedom due to the fact that their race had only 
recently discovered Atari, and had no thumbs, leaving them unique
ly disadvanted. Bastard played a mean game of Pong, though.

I made that mysogynistic cave 
man respect my womanly ways!
I crushed him under my mighty 
fists! I gouged him with my high 
heels of death! I reduced him to 
a shambles!
I used the word "lard.Hey Femdy, I heard you and 
Fore got into a scuffle.
Just a moment, son. You said 
"her?" Did you, by chance, make 
any reference to this woman's 
weight, age, physical appearance, 
personality, or family lineage?
So you were kicked, punched,
and then kicked again'
Totally.Yes Officer Baron, that 
was her general attack 
pattern.

The concept of listening to 
Kraftwerk is much better 
than actually listening to 
the music itself.
That retro techno beat is often 
hard to appreciate when the 
same Moog-synthesized string 
of notes has been played for 
the 48th time in a row.
So I came to a compromise: 
listen to Kraftwerk on mu.te,

1. We're not accepting anything for this 
semester anymore, just for next semester.
2. You'll be asked to submit a sample of your 
comic. It can be a quick sketch, or a descrip
tion, or an actual comic if you've started draw
ing one. Submit your comics via email (a uuencoded TIFF file, please) to derekg+@andrew, 
or drop off hard copies in the Tartan office, UC 
314.
3. Your submission will be reviewed by the 
friendlv art folks here at the Tartan. If they like 
it, we'll email you or call you and let you know. 
Comics don't necessarily need to be pretty or 
well-drawn, but they have to have a point and 
people have to see that point. A Comic full of 
inside jokes for you and your friends isn't what 
we mean.
4. If you get accepted, you'll have to agree to 
submit a copy of your work each ana every 
week there is a Tartan for the entire semester. If 
you miss a week and don't tell the Comics Guy 
in advance, you'll probably stop being run in 
the paper and not considered to start running 
again until the next semester. If you have a 
good excuse, that's fine: just let us know ahead 
of time. "I didn't feel like it this week," is not a 
good excuse.
That's it. Getting your comic in the paper isn't 
all that tough. Just remember, you've gotta com
mit for the semester.

If you could be anyone you 
wanted to be for 15 min
utes, who would it be?
If you answered John 
Malkovich, then youre 
in luck. If you didnt, 
well, you can still be 
John Malkovich.
Being John
Malkovich opens as an 
unemployed puppeteer,
Craig Schwartz (John 
Cusack), decides that 
it is time to get a job. He 
applies for and receives 
a filingjob on the sevenand-l/2th floor of an 
otherwise typical office 
building. The floors 
ceilings are only about 
five feet tall, so every
one must duck down, as 
the businesses joke 
about low overhead.
While sorting files one 
day, Craig discovers a 
secret portal that leads 
inside the mind of John Malkovich 
(playing himself). Soon after, 
Craig, along with coworker 
Maxine (Catherine Keener), opens 
a business that will allow patrons 
to go into Johns mind. Business is 
slow at first, but soon long lines 
are forming each night.
Maxine starts dating John and 
before long both Craig and his 
wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), are 
chasing after Maxine through 
Johns body. Things quickly get 
more complicated as Malkovich 
learns of the portal and wants it 
stopped. To learn what happens 
next, youll have to see the movie.
Being John Malkovich starts a 
little slow, but once it gets going 
there is plenty to keep the viewer 
interested. Writer Charlie 
Kaufman packs the script with
comic devices; there are funny nature. Craigs unending love for 
images, funny characters, and Maxine versus her desire to use 
funny dialogue. Not every joke is him is also explored at length, 
a winner, but there are enough The acting in Being John

winners to make almost any 
viewer happy. Kaufman avoids 
overloading the viewer by includ
ing plenty of serious elements. 
First-time director Spike Jonze 
also does an excellent job. He keeps
Malkovich is excellent. Cusack, 
Diaz, and Keener all play their 
characters quite well, but it is 
Malkovich who really steals the 
show. His role requires him to 
switch personalities rapidly and
scenes to an appropriate length to act like Craig Schwartz for an
and keeps things from dragging, 
handling the movie as if he had 
years of experience.
Being John Malkovich is far 
from a pointless comedy, however. 
The movie has plenty to say about 
society, what it means to be one
self, and the nature of love. For 
example, Craigis concerned about 
the psychological importance of 
the portal, but ignores his con
cerns in order to make a quick 
buck. The comedic elements of the 
situation make it clear that 
Kaufman is poking fun at human
extended period of time. His per
formance is pure genius as the 
viewer truly believes that he is 
Craig; the two parts are indistin
guishable despite being portrayed 
by different actors. The 
puppeteering, which plays an im
portant role, is also very well done.
Being John Malkovich is a truly 
unique movie. Led by its unique 
plot and humorous visual imag
ery, the movie also has plenty of 
serious points to make. Being John 
Malkovich will be enjoyed by just 
about everyone who sees it.

Originally, Disney had slated the se
quel to 1995s blockbuster Toy Story for 
video-only release, like it had done with 
previous hits like Aladdin and The Lion 
King. However, after judging the film 
just too good for such a fate, Disney 
execs went ahead with a full theatrical 
release. Although the studios rationale 
sounds like a lame attempt to generate
buzz, the film manages to live up to its 
promise. Voiced by an all-star cast 
headed by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, 
Toy Story 2 is an enjoyable romp, one 
that retains traditional Disney values of 
friendship and loyalty but with an atti
tude more witty than sappy.
Toy Story 2s real action kicks off when 
heroic cowboy Woody (Hanks) is stolen 
from a yard sale by Al, a toy collector and 
proprietor of Als Toy Barn. (The pudgy, 
grubby, Newman-like Al is appropri
ately voiced by Wayne Knight, Newman 
himself.) At Als home, Woody literally 
discovers who he really is  the star of 
a wildly popular 50s-era childrens tele
vision show and member of an enor
mously valuable set of four characters 
from the show.
Al intends to sell the set of toys, in: 
eluding Woody, his horse Bullseye, cow
girl Jessie, and sidekick Stinky Pete, to 
a museum in exchange for a sizable 
sum. The situation sets up the moral 
dilemma that directs the rest of the film: 
Will Woody decide to stay with his new
found friends or try to escape and rejoin 
his old set? Further complicating mat
ters are Buzz Lightyear (Allen) and 
crews quixotic (and hilarious) efforts to 
rescue Woody. Its a fairly predictable 
situation, but it nevertheless provides 
the movie with much of its depth and 
thoughtfulness.
Looking back, Toy Story 2 could have 
been entirely Woody and Buzz reading 
from phone books and still wouldnt have 
been half-bad, thanks to the amazing 
computer-generated graphics, again 
courtesy of Pixar studios. Both human 
and toy characters are remarkably life
like, and the toys unique perspective 
gives the animators all sorts of freedom 
to play around with the scenery.
Certainly, Toy Story 2 is meant to pull
in a young audience, but like its prede
cessor, it features a remarkably sharp 
sense of humor. The witty screenplay 
cleverly references and pokes fun at 
Lassie, Star Wars, and Airplane!, giving 
parental escorts something to watch for. 
In addition, Don Rickless sarcastic turn 
as Mr. Potato Head delivers some of Toy 
Story 2s best lines, as he bounces in
sults off of fellow toys Rex (Wallace 
Shawn) and Hamm (JohnRatzenberger).
Toy Story 2, by nature, isnt quite as 
inventive as the original movie. Never
theless, it is without a doubt one of the 
most fun movies that has been released 
this year. The film is one of those rare 
movies which really can appeal to all 
ages-even cynical college kids like my
self can appreciate both Toy Story 2s 
stunning visuals and sneaky in-jokes. 
Plus, as the animated storyline becomes 
increasingly sophisticated (see The 
Simpsons, Antz) Toy Story 2s feel-good, 
buddy-picture atmosphere takes a 
simple story about friendship and crafts 
it into a remarkable picture.

To thine own self be true, said 
Polonius in William 
Shakespeares infamous play 
Hamlet. Yet, he comes alive one 
tnore time to utter these power
ful words to the new king of Den
mark, Fortinbras.
So, who is Fortinbras? Any 
Shakespeare scholar can reflect 
on Fortinbrass minor role in 
Hamlet. He is the prince of Nor
way who enters the final scene 
once Hamlet is killed. The dying
Hamlet has left news with his 
friend Horatio that young 
Fortinbras can be trusted with 
the land. Thus, Fortinbras be
comes king once the curtain closes 
on Shakespeares play.
However, Scotch n Sodas rec
reation of Lee Blessings 
Fortinbras picks up the tale of 
Hamlet after Fortinbras was 
named king. The tale begins 
when Fortinbras and the captain 
ofthe Norwegian army enter with 
the English ambassador to see 
the site of the murderous trag
edy. Horatio informs FortinbrasVol,4e h4,w so,lod 1g1 s,pi 9I4h,4wIp Fortinbras ldue 9iel IISIgp2
of his new role, and the young 
king makes a few decisions in his 
seat of power. The first is to de
vise a lie that the people of Den
mark will believe, a lie that will 
cover up the mystery ofthe deaths 
in the castle. With Horatios un
dying attempts to speak the truth, 
Fotinbras creates lie after lie, in
sisting upon burying the bodies 
of Hamlet, Claudius, and 
Gertrude in sacred land. As his 
lies continue, the ghosts of 
Polonius, Ophelia, Laertes, 
Claudius, and Gertrude come 
back to help him reflect on the
truth  the truth that Polonius 
spoke of at the beginning of Ham
let and continued to talk about in 
the days of Fortinbrass reign.
The story takes'a turn with the 
introduction of Ophelias ghost. 
In Hamlet, Ophelia killed herself 
by drowning. She was in love with 
Hamlet and her obsession grew, 
tragically ending in insanity. Yet 
in Fortinbras, she comes back, 
dressed in a black, slinky, and 
sparkling dress, strutting forward 
and advancing toward 
Fortinbras. She is a dominant

.sexual character, after the 
;;love of any man willing to 
give her more than she received 
in Hamlet. Not only is she sexu
ally driven, but she is also the 
only spirit who wishes that 
Fortinbras would lie. If he lies, 
she can continue walking the 
corridors of the castle because 
her soul will not be at rest.
All the ghosts are sinners and 
need to be punished for their ac
tions. Since Fortinbras is lying 
j.about what they did, they will con
tinue to haunt him until he tells 
{the truth.
\ This play once again demon
strated hard work and dedication 
on the part of ScotchnSoda. It 
took many theatrical elements and 
.created a pleasing overall experi, ence. The time and devotion com.mitted to this performance were 
admirable.
Ho wever, Poloniuss words seem 
to be missing from this production 
ofjFortinbras. To thine own self be 
true played the major role in this 
show. Fortinbras had to be truth.ful in order to rid himself of the 
ghosts of the past. It seemed that 
this truthful device needed to be 
arried out to its fullest in order to

design a well-connected play.
The palace setting was cre
atively built in Rangos Ballroom, 
extending out past the stage to 
make the actors seem much
closer to the audience. The set 
had four entranceways leading 
onto the center stage, depicting 
the kings throne. Placed on ei
ther side of the set were the kings
chambers and the queens cham
bers. Most noteworthy was the 
roof of the palace that was de
signed so that a main course of 
action occurred up above the ac
tual set. This feature was 
extraordinarily interest
ing, yet it caused a few 
problems with the en
trance of the actors.
The lighting placed a 
damper, on the perfor
mance as every scene 
change seemed to take 
longer than necessary. 
Generally, blackouts and 
fade-to-blacks are done 
purposefully by the direc
tor and lighting designer 
to create a mood or tone for 
to the play.
Here, it seemed as 
though actors would pose 
and then the light would 
fade-causing a slight dis
traction that could have 
easily been avoided. The 
pace of the play could have 
been picked up tremen
dously with a quicker light
ing pattern.
Costuming was another 
interesting aspect of the 
performance. If a charac
ter was alive, his or her costume 
was designed to be in 
Shakespearean period, while dead 
characters were dressed in a more 
contemporary style. This dichotomy could have been well 
suited if, in fact, this element of 
double standard existed through
out the play.
If a world can bring ghosts back 
to life and make them exactly the 
opposite of their original character 
and place television sets in 
Hamlets time, then the entire pro
duction should live in the over
whelming and unheard-of. Doc
tor Noah Donaldson found a strong 
script that analyzes the underly
ing purpose of honesty and truth.
Overall, the performance 
was enjoyable. Standing out far 
from the rest was Joshua Horan'as 
Horatio, played with such a strong 
desire and urgency to speak the 
only truth. Hunter Howe was best 
as Hamlet when he was stuck in 
the television box and Nikki 
McCrea portrayed the oppressed 
Ophelia with a forcible drive tolbe 
loved by her Hamlet nd 
Fortinbras.
Humorous anecdotes were found 
among Claudius and Gertrude 
played by Jason Martin and Gris 
Peterson, and the guards, Geoffrey 
Plitt and Andrew Corum. Tim Fife 
portrayed the title character, 
Fortinbras, with a sense of|tinknowing flight to tell the truth.04ulI4 ,hhI4e pItuou,be 4Iou9Ie h,4 vdigSe6umug6

FOR TARTAN TURKEY:
Start by making the stuffing in 
advance (recipe follows).
Preheat oven to 450 degrees . 
Rinse the Tartan Turkey inside 
and out and pat dry. Squeeze 
the juice of the oranges all over 
the turkey and in the neck and 
body cavities. Spoon the stuff
ing loosely into the cavities. Set 
aside any extra stuffing. Sew 
up the cavities or close with 
small trussing skewers.
Place the Tartan Turkey on a 
roasting rack in a roasting pan. 
Sprinkle all over with thyme, 
and salt and pepper to taste. 
Spread the butter all over the 
Tartan Turkey. Turn breastside up in the pan and cover the 
pan with aluminum foil.
Place the Tartan Turkey in 
the oven and reduce the heat to 
325 degrees. Roast for 3 hours.
Remove the foil and roast, 
basting occasionally: until the 
juices run clear when the meaty 
part of a thigh is pierced with a 
sharp skewer, about 2 more 
hours. Bake the leftover stuff
ing in a baking dish at 325 de
grees for 30 minutes.
Let the Tartan Turkey stand, 
covered with foil for 15 minutes 
before carving.
Make plenty of Tartan Turkey 
so that you can have lots of left
overs when you return to CMU.

Thursday, November 18
Before Wes Craven directed the beautiful girls in 
the Scream series, he created the gorgeous Mr. 
Freddie Krueger. After th eNightmare on Elm Street 
series began, however, he produced this movie, 
which is a lot less scary than the movies hes known 
for. Heck, I dont think any movie with Bill Pullman 
can be considered extremely scary.
Pullman plays a Harvard doctor who ventures to 
Haiti to investigate some kind of voodoo stuff. Like 
Mountain Dew at CMU, people who die are brought 
back to life as zombies, thanks to this magic voodoo. 
But rather than the possibility of becoming impo
tent like Bob Dole, this voodoo can cause much more 
serious side effects. Pullman finds himself fighting 
for his life to get away from the magic.

Bill Clinton may have said it best when he praised 
this movie and extolledit as high-brow pornography. 
(Well, to be totally precise, it wasnt actually Clinton. 
It was a guy who sounds and acts like Clinton on the 
radio show Imus In The Morning. Details, 
schmetails...)
This movie is for all those who are afraid to be seen 
at McConomy waiting in line for Disco Dolls in 3-D or 
Flesh Gordon. If nothing but the thought of sophisti
cated sex  or the fact that computer-generated 
images are the only thing that separates you from a 
controversially edited orgy  makes you shamefully 
excited about this movie, go see it! When someone 
spots you in McConomy, simply explain that youre a 
big Kubrick fan and want to view this winding tale of 
insecurity and intensive mind games. Then you can 
watch as that person sneaks into the end of the line. 
After all, your friend secretly wants to view cerebral

When Stephen King calls your film something like 
the way horror movies should be made, I have to 
think you did a damn good job. Dont listen to those 
nay-sayers who thought this movie was disappoint
ing. After a few beers, theyTl confess to being sweaty 
when the movie was over. These critics are simply 
basingtheir opinion on the fact that they never embar
rassingly, suddenly screamed at a particular scene. 
But when did one scene ever make a movie? (This 
doesnt count the legendary I believe the novels of 
Susan Sontag are self-indulgent, overrated crap ... 
speech Kevin Costner made in Bull Durham.) The 
bottom line is that you may not scream during this 
movie or you may not admit to it, but as soon as the sun 
sets in the film, youll be scared.

November is Post-Apocalyptic Month for Sunday

Damme. The name may sound like that of a French

Brussels. You may not have heard of this film, but you 
may remember a little incident when he was sued for 
gouging the eye out of an extra during a swordfight 
scene. That was during the making of this movie. 
Apparently, hes so intense in fight scenes that film
makers are scared of producing them in America in 
fear of lawsuits.

Ani DiFranco 
To The Teeth 
Righteous Babe Records
Ani DiFrancos third album this year  
yes, third, entitled To The Teeth  is full of 
jazz and funk, cities, sweetness, and even 
bitterness. She has dropped on us (me, 
the seasoned listener) a successful experi
ment into the limits of folk. And she finds, 
once again, that the limits are spread far 
and wide.
Her other two albums this year, Up Up Up 
Up Up Up and Fellow Workers, a collabora
tion with folk-pro Utah Phillips, most likely 
made DiFrancos die-hard listener base (me 
included, Ill admit) feel a bit nostalgic for 
the days of Dilate and Not a Pretty Girl, 
when we sang along angrily.
To The Teeth strays even further from the 
fern-rock shes most known for. She takes 
the listener to her most recent places  the 
spited hometown of Buffalo in Hello, Bir
mingham, a fated party in Providence, 
and even an affectionate afternoon at The 
Arrivals Gate. She takes us into jazz and 
soul territory, bringing in such guests as 
funk band leader Maceo Parker, who she 
toured with this past summer, and the art
ist formerly known as Prince, a happily 
unpredictable move. Parker moves this al
bum, adding his influence to several satisfyingjazz hooks in tracks such as Swing and 
Back Back Back.
DiFranco is the hardest-working artist in 
folk, rock, (jazz?), or whatever. To The Teeth 
shows her thoughtfulness, her willingness 
to be daring. As for those skeptical fans, it 
may be too much to ask, but this ones worth 
your time.

Counting Crows 
This Desert Life 
Greffen Records, Inc.
For some reason, Counting Crowss music 
doesnt leave me with the sense of sadness one 
might expect from frontman Adam Duritzs 
lyrics. A quick read through the liner notes of 
their latest effort, This Desert Life, yields 
lines like Well I got all this time/To be 
hating what I am, and I get so nervous ... 
Im shaking/Gets so I got no pride at all. Its 
clear Duritz doesnt exactly feel on top of the 
world; nevertheless, the bands roots-rock 
sound consistently exudes a feel-good vibe 
and makes sure the melody sticks in your 
head long after the melancholy.
The leadoff track and first single, 
Hanginaround, juggles a fuzzy guitar riff 
and a breezy piano line so expertly you 
hardly notice the lyrical frustration and 
disillusionment. Elsewhere on the record, 
though, Duritzs themes of restlessness 
and his desire to improve his situation 
shine through and give the songs some emo
tional weight.
The Crows employ strings throughout the 
record, most memorably on All My Friends, 
which achieves a genuine sense of loneliness 
and proves the albums most compelling 
listen. However, simple tunes like Color
blind and Amy Hit the Atmosphere suffer 
from a lack of musical atmosphere, and dur
ing a few other songs you might find yourself 
wishing the band had focused more on their 
jangly guitars and pop hooks than on Duritzs 
vocals.
At times, Counting Crows can sound more 
anonymous than befits them. Duritzs dis
tinct voice, largely responsible for earlier 
hits like Mr. Jones and Long December,
sounds strangely plain at times, and the 
rest of the group doesnt always have enough 
tricks in its bag to compensate. Catchiness 
is by no means a prerequisite for good 
songwriting, but Counting Crows could 
probably use a little of it here and there to 
punch up a few songs.
Compared to most of 1999s rock records, 
This Desert Life seems fairly understated; 
the easygoing strumming of High Life 
and the Dylanesque organ on St. Robinson 
in His Cadillac Dream are far removed 
from the crunching guitar dominating the 
airwaves the Crows once patrolled. Still, 
the record is nothing if not pleasant, and 
gets better with repeated playings.
Although the band probably wont dupli
cate the phenomenal success of their smash 
debut August and Everything After, this 
album is a well-crafted trip to rocks yester
year. Adam Duritz may not be the happiest 
singer around, but a few listens to This 
Desert Life certainly couldnt hurt.

21)
Youre in for a real treat\this 
week Scorpie. ;Lots of sex and 
lpvin has made you lightheaded 
and/ dreamy. Well, due to your 
recent conjugal high, you bought 
enough separates to keep the 
GAPs sweatshop industry boom
ing!. Everybody; below minimum 
wage!. Love those vests!
Sagittarius (Ndveinber 22-Decemier 21)\
Bravo, Sagjgie, youve struck 
quite a coup recently- I apjplaud 
your gusto, you ballsy go-getter. 
Its good to see some Momo is fi
nally rubbing off on you. A word of 
warning though, dont rub too 
close, youre likely to pick up that 
clover-shaded rash thats migrated 
down south for the winter.
Capricorn {December 22-January 19)
Cappy, its good to see that deep 
down, you are truly a young re
sponsible adult: Being the desig
nated driver is always a com
mendable and.savvy responsibil
ity. It gives you perfect position
ing/to take advantage of your 
friends, whether it be sexually or 
monetarily. Although, I musttell 
you, a truly responsible driyer
would never let drunk people 
throw whole pumpkins at a frat 
house at 2 in the morning. Then 
again, who the F cares?
Aquarius (January 20-February18)As a wise old woman once told 
me, revengeis a dish best served 
cold.Unfortunately for you, 
Quarie, the same isnt true for a 
tuna casserole. Take;advantage 
of tHe upcoming Thanksgiving 
break to pop your epicurial 
cherrf'.'Grab a turkey and a 
baster and go to town. The tur
key takes 4-6 hours, you and the 
baster can go all night.
Pisces (February 19-March 20) 
My pesky little Ssces, what 
the F am I to do with you? Your 
foul-mouthed anticfehave oifce 
again gotten you in deep poop^y Its, time to wash out your 
ruouth mth some Moino sbaj) 
before you'go straight;to H-EDouble-hockey- sticks!
Aries CMarch 21-April 19)
HeyKrAries, did you ever no
tice ho\v your sign rhymes with 
the word^;fairies? You should 
take this as a sign and embrace 
this side p yourself. I mean, 
who doesnt find delight and 
wonder in these magical and 
whimsical creatures from our 
childhood tales? Certainly not 
Momo.
Some of my best friends are 
fairies. Dont believe me? Stop 
by my Golden Globe party next 
month  therell be more 
screaming queens there than at 
the French Revolution. Ha.
Taurus (.April 20-May'2QX 
Theres nothing like a dinner 
party to get your spirits up, 
Taurie. As with, any party, 
though, its all about who 
you invite. Heres iriy?- time-hon
ored guest list that is sure to 
guarantee an unforgettable gath
ering: Colonel Sanders, Jack 
Daniels, and Ben & Jerry. A word 
of warning to the ladies: keep 
your eye on the colonel. He might 
look old and frail, but his hands 
move quicker that a bucket of 
original recipe legs at a Weight 
Watchers meeting.
Gemini-(May 21-June2&i 
In tfase youre unaware 
Gemmie, its November sweeps 
for the big networks-, a-time 
when Momo^ puts her Nielsen 
rating power to full advantage. 
Lastyear, I single-handedly put 
Suddenly Susan in the top 10 
with my fanatical vi|jsvmg*C^re 
year, c(ve decided tp^put my ef
forts behind an underdog, Two 
Guys and a Girl. (The pizza place 
took a ten- picture deal with 
Miramax.)
Cancer {June 22-Jupy 22)
As my^ld; friend Regis asks 
nightljr on^.the hit 'ABC gaine 
show, who wants to be a mil
lionaire? Certainly not you, Can
cer, or virtuous self is'' far 
above petty monetary gairis. I 
admire your integrity ... and 
have I told you how attractive 
youve been looking lately? 
Momo thinks you look fab!
Those.slacks youve been 
wearing are trs flattering to 
your derrire. By the way, can I 
borrow a few bucks?
Leo (July 23-August 22)
Oh my dear lions, if you think 
that left a foul taste; in your 
mouth, try doing it without 
mouthwash! These are the Uni
versal words of truth that my 
mother once told me. This was 
right before she went to get 
some ciggies and left me and 
my kid sister in a rusted out 
station wagon behind a con
demned supermarket and never 
returned. Her advice put us both 
through beauty school.
Virgo (August-September 22) 
Where my boils at? On my 
front, my back, Is you feeling 
that? Put one hand up and smear 
some salve okj; Whts doin back 
there? Mind the ooze and pass 
the booze! Ive got my'ttem 
shoes on and Im read/fpr a 
party,; irgie, and now that my
topical ointment has een ap
plied, Im good for 4-6 hours.("u4l r

Long before Keanu was in The 
Matrix, before Sigourney first 
met the Alien, and before Har
rison and Mark battled the dark 
side of the Force, space 
and time was conquered 
by Buck, Flash, and most 
often, Martians. As a 
film genre, sci-fi grew 
out of horror films and 
was inspired by the 
clank and clang of the 
Industrial Revolution.
Sci-fi cinema officially 
began in 1926 with 
Fritz Lang's Metropolis, 
in which a beautiful 
female robot compels 
drone-like working 
class to overthrow the 
elite intellectuals who 
the society.
Fast forward to 
1950s, when sci-fi reached 
its pinnacle. The Day the 
Earth Stood Still is one of 
the best science fiction 
films of the 1950s. An alien 
diplomat and his giant 
robot Gort (pictured 
right) come to earth to 
warn of the dangers of 
nuclear proliferation.
In the same year was When Worlds Collide, an updat
ed, secularized Biblical story of the Flood. In 1953 
came War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells' eery tale of Mar
tian invasion. Invasion of the Body Snatchers fol
lowed, depicting a town being replaced by pod.-people. In 1956, it was Earth versus the Flying Saucers 
(see below), with a fantastic destruction of Wash
ington D.C. And don't miss Forbidden Planet, featur
ing Leslie Nielsen in a dramatic role opposite the 
amicable Robby the Robot. Planet, with its elaborate 
sets and refreshingly new plot, is probably the sec
ond best sci-fi film of the 1950s.
Nearly every big-budget sci-fi film today, bor
rows heavily from 1950's flicks. Campy though they 
may be, the old sci-fi flicks were sparkling with
originality, and deserve 
more attention than 
they've received.
