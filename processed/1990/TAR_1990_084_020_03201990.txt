Guard battles Pittsburgh in court
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Mike Slater feels his calling was to be 
a police officer. With four years of expe
rience and a number of commendations 
under his belt, Slater moved from Ful
ton County, Georgia, where he was last 
an officer, to Pittsburgh in April so he 
and hisnew wife could be closer to her 
parents. Family is the most important 
thing there, is, says Slater.
So why is he now checking IDs at the 
gym and guarding at Mellon Institute as 
a member of Carnegie Mellons security 
force? Thats what his lawsuit is asking.
Slater filed suit in federal court on
Wednesday challenging a 1975 quota 
system that requires the city of Pitts
burgh to hire officers in groups of four 
one white male, one white female, one 
black male, and one black female -4- in 
an affirmative action plan implemented 
to remedy the citys past police force 
membership that was virtually all 
white, virtually all male, according to a 
former state attorney general who was 
involved in the quota ruling.
In order to become an officer of the 
'Pittsburgh Police Department, the ap
plicant has to take a test. Slater scored 
94 out of 100 on the exam.
Slater looks back fondly on his life be
fore coming to Pittsburgh. My wife and
I had a gorgeous home  a lakeview 
home, he says. I had it made with the 
county.... I gave it all up to come up here 
thinking it would be absolutely no prob
lem, he says. I went through all the 
rules step by step, bought a house in the 
city, did everything I was supposed to 
do, and a 94 just wasnt good enough. 
After taking the test, Slater went to 
check on his ranking. I was looking at 
the list and I told the woman, Im ranked 
233, yet heres a person with a 94 and 
theyre ranked 10th, and heres another 
one with a 94 and theyre ranked eighth. 
Then she said, Well, youre looking at 
the wrong list.

Carnegie Mellon professors are 
getting high scores from their stu
dents, according to the results of the 
fall 1989 Faculty Course Evaluations.
According to Edwin Fenton, co
director of the University Teaching 
Center, students should absolutely 
look at the results. The Faculty 
Course Evaluations are reliable 
measures of what students learn, 
he said.
On a scale of one (poor) to five 
(excellent), almost all Carnegie Mel
lon professors were rated favorably 
(about a 4). Preliminary analysis of 
the FCEs indicates that 35 professors are in the upper echelon, with 
average ratings above 4.75 even 
when only response groups of ten 
or more students were considered. 
In general, instructors of small 
classes also received ratings which 
were just as high. Only five in
structors received overall ratings 
of less than two.
According to the FCE results, 
some professors presented particu
larly shining examples of good 
teaching. The top picks include Cliff 
Davidson of Civil Engineering, Wil
liam Hrusa, Jr., and Jack Schaef
fer of Mathematics, and virtually 
all of the Fine Arts faculty. Many 
students also awarded Paul Smith

Investigation uncovers no hazing at ATO

A Student Affairs investigation 
into an incident at the Alpha Tau 
Omega fraternity three weeks ago 
has uncovered no evidence of 
hazing, according to Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Ronald 
Campana.
Officials of the ATO national, 
however, are just beginning their
investigation into the incident.
According to Campus Police, a 
pledge involved in an,,initiation 
ritual called Repa ran naked 
onto Morewood Avenue. Campus 
Police said that they received a 
similar complaint, involving 
someone who ran from the ATO 
patio clad in only a jock strap and 
displayed his bare buttocks to an 
oncoming vehicle.
Repa, according to ATO Presi

runs up to a wall, slams the paddle strength of the paddle.
If you look at it, you have to 
wonder if hazing is what were 
seeing here, said Carnegie Mel
lon Police Chief James LaPaglia. 
But we arent designating these 
as such. Theres not enough evi
dence here to come to that conclu
sion.
My first thought was that this 
[incident] needs to be investi

Only $1,100 is left in the Student 
Activities Fee account after Student 
Senates payment of the $11,000 
production bill for last years 
yearbook, The Thistle. The account, 
which previously contained $12,000, 
must last Senate through the rest of 
the fiscal year. .
This is something we completely 
didnt anticipate, said Student Gov
ernment Treasurer Lisa Melenyzer.
Based on past sales, Senate had 
budgeted only between $4,000 and 
$5,000 for last years yearbook.
We knew that the bill for The
Thistle was going to come in, said 
Student Senate Chair Chris Neigh

to be for such a large amount.
According to Julia Barry, who was 
spring layout editor of last years

these causes were frequently 
changed deadlines which were never 
actually enforced, a staff of four

City restricts parking
By CARLOS H. FRANCO
Tartan Contributing Editor
Areas where students without 
permits can park have been moved 
further away from the University 
because of a recent decision by 
Pittsburghs City Council which 
designated a series of streets in
cluding Clyde Street, Ellsworth, and 
Devonshire Road as J permit park
ing zone.
Many students are concerned with 
the zoning designation. Oscar 
Mayer, executive assistant to the 
vice president for business affairs
and enrollment, expressed a differ
ent view. The University is not 
opposed to the permit system; we 
are concerned that a public resource 
that could be used for day parking 
has been lost, he said.
Mayer asserts that the permit 
parking is good because it solves 
several problems that residents who 
live by parking generators face. 
First, when people park everywhere 
and there are many obstructions to 
traffic, people cannot safely exit 
their driveways. Second, neighbors 
are concerned with cars that are

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
CFA opens studio to 
encourage creative inquiry
The College of Fine Arts has opened a new studio for multi
disciplinary artistic investigation and experimentation  the 
Studio for Creative Inquiry (SFCI). The unit will foster and 
support creative arts both within the Carnegie Mellon and Pitts
burgh communities and throughout the world.
, The creation of the Studio for Creative Inquiry underscores 
,, Carnegie Mellons commitment to innovative and investigative 
,; activities within its community, said Carnegie Mellon Provost 
Angel G. Jordan.
. One of the main projects of the SFCI will be sponsoring a 
-fellowship program from which most of its activities will emerge. 
Fellows will be chosen through a competitive application/invita
tion process.
This new center is envisioned as a development site for activi
ties on the edge, as a cultural Tree zone where the unnameable 
, can be nurtured, said Bryan Rogers, head of Carnegie Mellons 
,, art department and also the new director of the SFCI.
The SFCI is located in room 111 of the College of Fine Arts.
CMU math team places 
well in Putnam competition
The Carnegie Mellon team which competed in the 50th annual 
Putnam mathematical competition placed tenth in the overall 
competition, with four students placing in the top 200. One of 
these students, senior Karl Westerberg, placed in the top 40, re
ceiving an Honorable Mention.
The competition, held on December 2, 1989, attracted 2,392 
, contestants from 373 schools. The top score was 94 out of a 
possible 120, and only 44 students received a score of 50 or higher. 
Michael Albert of the Math Department hopes that Carnegie Mel
lon will continue to perform well in future Putnam competitions.

Gorbachev 
coaxes leaders 
to accept change
MOSCOW (AP)  Last Friday, 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
opened an important Communist 
Party Central Committee meetingto a group of radical reformers 
who have demanded that the 
party apologize for decades of 
totalitarianism.
In his first 24hours in his newly 
strengthened job, Gorbachev also 
persuaded the Soviet Parliament 
to tone down a resolution invali
dating Lithuanias declaration of 
independence.
The party Central Committee 
followed last weeks historic par
liament session with a meeting of 
its own to consider scrapping the 
system that has allowed Communistbosses to strictly control party 
promotions.
Gorbachev has suggested allow
ing local party organizations to 
decide how to choose delegates to 
a critical party congress, which 
he said should start July 2. Party 
reformers want secret-ballot elec
tions, in which they could try to 
force out the old guard.
Radicals want even more, urg
ing abolishment of Communist 
Party cells in government agen
cies, farms, army units, police 
precincts and virtually every other 
institution.
Gorbachev brought representa
tives of about 40 groups of rankand-file Communists, including 
the radical Democratic Platform, 
to the closed-door Central Com

Players, owners 
hammer out 
tentative contract
NEW YORK (AP)  Baseball 
Commissioner Fay Vincent an
nounced early Monday morning 
that ah agreement in principle 
had been reached between the 
players association and the 
managements players relations 
committee to end the owners 
spring training lockout.
Vincent called the announce
ment a distinct pleasure.
He said it was a difficult proc
ess, but that the agreement is 
satisfying. He called the agree
ment and end to the lockout a 
good thing for baseball.
The four-year deal calls for a 
minimum salary of $100,000, up 
from $68,000.
Vincent said the deal also includes substantial contributions 
to the group pension plan of the 
players.
He said chief negotiators Don 
Fehr, for the players association, 
and Chuck OConnor, for the 
owners, would give details of the 
settlement reached on the sticky 
issue of salary arbitration at a 
later date.
Vincent said he believes open
ing day games would be played 
beginning Monday, April 9, and 
that the first week of games that 
are lost would be made up some
where along the line. He said that 
the schedule is among the techni
cal questions still being worked 
out.
Deputy Commissioner Steve 
Greenberg said that a tentative 
schedule had been worked out 
that would reduce each teams 
schedule by four games to 158.
Vincent said he believed the
game had been damaged by the 
delay in the start of the season, 
and that many people regret that 
damage. However, he said he 
doesnt believe the damage is 
permanent or substantial be
cause the recuperative powers of 
baseball are strong.

Career fair presents companies with consciences
By MARK HALL
Tartan Staffwriter
The Toward Tomorrows World career 
fair will be held tomorrow in the Skibo 
Ballroom from noon to 4 pm. Employers 
demonstrating a commitment to address
ing social concerns are invited to recruit 
at this event.
A variety of non-profit and public serv
ice organizations are slated to attend, 
including the John F. Kennedy Center 
for the Performing Arts, the Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the 
Peace Corps, and the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. 
Positions offered include volunteer work, 
Internships, and part-time and full-time 
employment.
Reference copies of employer data, 
outlining each companys employment 
opportunities, are available in the 
(SUPA) Career Services Office, the Ca
reer Center, and the EPP department.
According to Indira Nair, employer 
registration chair, some of the criteria 
used in determining which companies 
were invited include having good em
ployment records of women and minori
ties, no defense-related funding, and no 
investment in South Africa. Chemical 
and cosmetic companies had to meet 
guidelines on animal research. She said 
the selection process also relied heavily 
on books such as Corporations with'a 
_ Conscience for background information.
It was assumed that non-profit and 
public service companies were okay, said 
Nair. The sponsors of the career fair 
invited these companies because they 
dont often get the chance to come to 
campus. Unlike the Toward Tomorrows 
World career fair, which does not charge 
for tables, most career fairs, such as 
those sponsored by SWE and IEEE, 
typically charge between $500 and $600 
for tables, according to Nair.
Initially, the organizing committee had
This whole thing is about paying attention to 
values in choosing a career. 
 Karen Litzinger, 
associate director of Career Services
qualms about pre-screening, said Nair, 
because ultimately, you should let the 
student decide. The controversial na
ture of the criteria was also of concern. 
Carnegie Mellon wouldnt have quali
fied for this fair, for example, she said.
Karen Litzinger, associate director of 
Career Services, wished to de-emphasize the pre-screening criteria, saying 
that the point was moot anyway. She 
said no invited private company was 
able to attend, although some, such as 
AT&T and Proctor and Gamble, ex
pressed great interest.
Litzinger said that the major goal of
the career fair is encouraging students 
to notice how their career choices can 
benefit society. This whole thing is about 
paying attention to values in choosing a 
career. Students should look at what 
type of product, service, and industry 
they want to be a part of.
Non-profit doesnt mean no-money 
either, Litzinger said. The [non-profit] 
sector itself is growing. Salaries are 
starting to catch up with the private. 
Litzinger said that because non-profit 
and public service organizations are of
ten too small to expend the resources 
required for the college recruiting cir
cuit, many people arent exposed 
enough to this type of career.
Litzinger also said that students should 
do some career exploring.
[The career fair] should be relaxed 
enough for the student to ask what it 
means to be a policy analyst, for exT 
ample. She also suggested that stu-jdents should feel free to cross disciplines 
in looking at careers at the fair. Stul 
dents sometimes feel labeled and con-i 
strained, often because CMU is highly 
specialized, she said.
Reference copies of employer data; 
outlining each companies employment 
opportunities, are available in the 
(SUPA) Career Services Office, the Ca
reer Center, and the EPP department.
The fair is sponsored by the Career 
Center, SUPA Career Services, Student 
Pugwash, and the Alumni Relations 
Office. Additional support came from 
CIT, CFA, Student Affairs, and the EPP 
department.

Gonul of GSIA, Laura Nettleton 
and Robert Taylor of Design, and 
Oswald Wyler of Mathematics 
scoring under the 2.0 mark.
Fenton said students should 
keep in mind that ratings tend to 
be lower in larger classes. Also, 
Fenton said, ratings are histori
cally lower in the hard-core sci
ences than in some H&SS classes, 
and lower in required classes than 
elected classes.
Fine Arts courses and faculty 
tend to receive high ratings, 
Fenton said, because there is a 
very close personal interaction 
between the students and faculty
... by the very nature of the disci
pline. I also think the instruction 
in CFA is particularly excellent.
All faculty are required to do 
evaluations, Fenton said. But he 
noted that some people dont do 
this. His advice to students was 
that they should complain to 
department heads to get faculty 
to submit to the evaluations.
[The FCEs] are always cited in 
considerations for reappointment, 
promotion, and tenure... particu
larly in marginal cases, Fenton 
said. Where a professor may be 
poor in research, the FCEs may 
tip the balance one way or an
other.
What is most helpful, said 
Fenton, are comments people 
write. Constructive comments are 
taken well and used by the fac
ulty: However, a lot of harm is
done by writing nasty comments, 
Fenton said. Thats really dys
functional.
The University Teaching Cen
ter tries to improve the quality of 
undergraduate and graduate 
teaching. Members of the center 
often talk with professors about 
teaching techniques, and often 
attend and videotape classes to 
provide assessments and recom
mendations. But Fenton said that 
they dont have the time or re
sources to actively seek out fac
ulty with poor ratings. Often, 
faculty are referred to the center 
by their deans. Fenton said, We 
try to work with people who want 
to change.
The FCE results have been re
leased and are available in the

sell as many copies as were needed to 
offset publishing costs. As a result, the 
1989 book was over budget. In the 
past, sales have been slightly lower 
than expected, but advertising reve
nue covered the difference. Last year, 
that was not a viable alternative.
' A lot of people still do not know that 
the books are here, said Barry.
; After spring break, Neighbor, Melenyzer, and members of the Senate 
Funding and Recognition Committee 
will meet with Associate Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Lois Cox, account direc
tor, to discuss Senates options.
Past contoversy has centered on 
Senates ability to use the contingency 
fund in this kind of situation. Each 
year, six percent of the total amount of
Activities Fee money paid by students 
is placed in this separate account. At 
the end of the year, it is returned to the 
activities fund and the process starts 
again. Fiscal policy mandates that this 
fund be reserved for emergencies.
The only thing we use the fund for 
is: and this is a prime example  if 
we got an electric bill or some weird 
thing like that from Spring Carnival 
for $13,000 right now, which would 
effectively bankrupt us. Because we 
are separate from the University, we 
would use the contingency fund. Thats 
what the contingency fund is for. We 
couldnt use it if a team came to us and 
wanted money to go to a champion
ship. But its there for an emergency. I 
dont think there is any danger of us 
going completely bankrupt.
Carnival probably will go over and 
we will declare a fiscal emergency, 
said Neighbor, and it will just come 
out of the six percent.
Neighbor says Senate plans to pro
pose an increase in the Activities Fee 
at the end of April. If the campus 
approves it, the Trustees may raise 
the fee from $80 to $100 per year.
We planned on raising the fee, 
said Neighbor. This will allow us to 
continue funding the clubs that we 
do. It should also insure that Senate 
doesnt come up short again, he said.
But Neighbor is not worried about 
this situation recurring with the 1990 
Thistle. I dont think there will be a 
problem with this years Thistle biii at 
all, he said. It has been run well this 
year.

tion of GSIA, reunions for 
alumni, a gala dinner dance, 
and an unveiling of the plans 
for GSIAs addition.
Debbie Stewart, director of 
Annual Giving and Alumni 
Activities says, We decided 
to plan the 40th anniversary 
during Carnival for the fun of 
it. The alumni like to come 
back for Carnival, and now 
there will be more activities 
for them. The scheduled 
events will not conflict with 
either Buggy Races on Friday 
and Saturday morning or the 
awards ceremony on Satur
day night.
Stewart adds that the cele
bration is open to the whole 
campus community. This is 
not limited to those affiliated 
with GSIA. The theme is in
ternationalization, and in 
that spirit, we welcome any
one. Those interested in at
tending the celebration 
should call x6119.

City requires permits, curtails parking on steets near campus

left in one spot for months at a time.
Heather Uljon, a junior MEMS major, 
is upset with the designation of permit 
parking areas. It takes me ten minutes 
to walk to my car in the morning, she 
sa^d. I cant get a campus permit. Even 
though I live at Roselawn, which is a 
Pittsburgh street and has a Pittsburgh 
mailing address, I cant get a parking 
permit.
John Butare, a junior math/computer 
science major, does not like the designa
tion of the J permit area either. I parked 
on Clyde Street before, but now that it is 
a permit area I park on Westminster. 
There is talk about Westminster going
permit. If Westminster goes permit I 
dont know what Ill do. My car isnt a 
convenience; it is too expensive to fly 
home to Massachusetts, so I drive. 
Senior GCM major Jonathan Uman 
agrees with Mayer. Since I live on 
[Ellsworth], I think its good. Local busi
nesses employees park on the street, 
taking up residents parking, and some 
people leave cars parked there forever. 
Lxxii Gillespie, a junior art major, has 
a different view. Gillespie lives in Fairfax 
apartments, an area which has not been 
designated as a permit parking zone. 
She feels that the idea of permit parking 
is good, but it upsets her that the area in 
which she lives has not been designated

permit only.
As a result, Gillespie currently parks 
on th streets that have been afected, 
and will have to find somewhere else to 
park when the new permit designation 
takes place at the beginning of April.
Mayer stated that the new parking 
garage should alleviate many of the 
parking problems. He said that this year
about 300 students have received park
ing permits. According to Mayer, only 
100 students who requested permits have 
not received them.
According to Michael Eannarino of the 
Oakland Planning office, the process of 
designating an area permit-parking only 
is a three-part process.
First a petition must be circulated; it
must contain the signatures of at least 
70 percent of the households that would 
be affected, he said.
Second, the area must meet the ordi- , 
nance requirements, like meeting cer
tain measured levels of parking use by 
non-residents.
The third step is zoning by the plan
ning commission and the City Council.
In addition to the establishment of the 
J permit area, the University has in
creased the price of the meters from $.25 ; 
for one half hour to $.25 per quarter , 
hour. According to Mayer, this was done 
to make metered parking better serve its 
intentionto provide parking to people 
who are visiting.
CMU security guard battles Pittsburgh Police in federal court

As Slaters suit states, the list 
from which the city chooses offi
cers places Slater at a distinct 
disadvantage. Under the pres
ent court-ordered system, the 
document reads, seventy-five 
percent of all police appointments 
will come from applicant lists that 
[Slater] cannot join, solely because 
of his race and gender.
While he agrees that there was 
a need for the quota system when 
it was implemented, Slater feels 
that the problem has been cor
rected and the quota system has 
run its course.
According to a report filed by 
the Federal Bureau of Justice 
statistics released in November, 
Pittsburgh ranked second in the 
number of women and eleventh 
in the number of black officers 
among the 25 largest police de
partments in the country. The 
present percentage of blacks in 
the force is about equal to the 
percentage of Pittsburgh resi
dents.
Now, says Slater, Western 
Pennsylvania is the hottest place 
for. all these large police depart
ments to come to get white males 
and other qualified people because 
they know they cant get hired 
here. There is such a saturation 
of good qualified people who would 
make excellent police officers but 
they cant because of this quota
If Martin Luther King were alive to

system.
Apparently, there is a great deal 
of public support for Slater. You' 
cannot believe how many people 
are for me, he says. I get calls 
from all over the United States 
that say yii dont know me, I 
know you, good luck, God bless 
you, whatever I can do to help let 
me know. Ive gotten hundreds of 
calls, its absolutely amazing.
Among the various calls of 
public support, Slater cites many 
instances in which callers claim 
to have dealt with the same prob
lems. Theres a Hispanic male 
that called me up today, Slater 
recalls. He said T got 106 on the 
test [an extra 10 points are given 
to veterans]. I went through the 
whole process, and right out of 
the blue, they dropped me be
cause they didnt have enough in 
the other categories. Its really 
unfortunate.
Slater says Pittsburghs poli
cies were very surprising and out 
of the ordinary. In Atlanta, he 
recounts, the birthright of the 
Civil Rights movement, they flat 
out told me at the academy we 
dont care if youre black, white, 
male, female, youre either good 
or youre not and thats where the 
old term the citys finest came in. 
They were very to the point with 
that.

Minutes of March 13,1990.
Special Business: BACCHUS 
requested funded recognition. The 
main purpose of BACCHUS is to 
provide education on responsible 
use of alcohol for college students. 
Recognition was approved by 
Senate by a vote of 16-11.
Educational Action on Latin 
America also requested funded 
recognition. Since Senate does not 
fund political organizations, the 
question was raised as to whether 
or not EALA is political. EALA 
pointed out that they do not advo
cate a certain idea about Latin 
America; their primary purposes 
are educational and social. They 
stress awareness rather than 
change in the government. The
request was approved by a vote of 
9-8-3.
Student Dormitory Council:
Eric Hamilton is the new presi
dent of SDC.
President - Mark Mittelhauser: PSAC met last week. The 
possibility of having renewable 
contracts for teachers at CMU 
was discussed. Funding for ath
letic clubs was also discussed. It 
appears that the $30,000 allocated 
for this purpose was closer to 
$8400. It was suggested that F&R 
and Senate look into this situ
ation. The smoking policy and a 
possible 5-year tuition policy were 
also discussed.

3/11 VEHICLE 
ACCIDENT,
12:21 am. Two 
CMU students 
were involved in a 
motorcycle acci
dent at the intersection of Forbes 
Avenue and South Dithridge 
Street. Pittsburgh Police, EMTs, 
and Campus Police responded. 
Both students were transported 
to Presbyterian University Hos
pital where they were admitted 
in serious condition.
3/11 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT/INDECENT EXPO
SURE, 12:35 am. A City Police 
unit was dispatched to Forbes and 
Morewood to disperse a large 
disorderly crowd that had placed 
a naked man on a vehicles wind
shield. The victim had driven to 
his residence before calling City 
Police, so when City Police and 
Campus Police units arrived, no 
one could be found in the area.
According to the police report, 
the cars driver phoned Campus 
Police and stated that while 
stopped at Forbes and Morewood, 
a group of about 75 people, drunk 
and drugged up, lifted a naked 
man in the air and placed him on 
the victims windshield 
3/11 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 3:40 am. A Campus Po
lice officer responded to an anony
mous call that a possible fight 
was occurring between Theta Xi 
and Kappa Sigma. After an inves
tigation, the officers concluded 
that two Theta Xi brothers wit
nessed four men climb onto the 
Kappa Sigma rear shanty and 
that some of the men were urinat
ing toward Theta Xi. At the same 
time, the storm window of the 
kitchen was broken out. The four 
men fled towards Kappa Sigma. 
Two could be identified by the 
witnesses. Two people, neither 
identified as Kappa Sigma brothskin is not important; the content 
of their character and their abili
ties are extremely important.
Presently, economic realities 
have set in for Slater and he is 
forced to think of what he gave up 
to come to Pittsburgh. I was 
making good money, my wife was 
making good money, we were 
making close to $40,000 a year. 
Now, Im making $6.46 an hour 
and taking all the overtime I can 
and my wife is working full time, 
and were just barely making ends 
meet.
He and his wife plan to start a 
family, but he points out that the 
current situation has to change 
first. Ive been told is that theres 
nothing I can do  youre David 
going up against Goliath, they 
say. He remains hopeful, how
ever, pointing out, Well, David 
did beat Goliath, didnt he?
When Slater found that the 
quota system would keep him 
from getting a job, he fruitlessly 
searched for help from the com
munity. I had no place to turn. 
As a white male, there were re
ally no organizations to turn to, 
so I went to the Equal Opportu
nity Division in Pittsburgh, think
ing that they would help me, he 
says. They filled out all the forms 
and sent them to Washington,
D.C. There the Justice Depart
ment got involved, and since they 
couldnt take care of it in time,
they wrote my attorney to file 
suit.
If I went to Detroit, Id have a 
job; Chicago, New York, L.A., any 
police department would scoop 
me up in a heartbeat, but in Pitts
burgh, its just thanks but no 
thanks.

James LaPaglia recognizes 
Slaters qualifications and points 
out that he would be an asset to 
the police force. However, there

were making a report for the

above, the transmitting micro
phone in the officers vehicle was

unlocked. An anonymous person 
later returned the microphone.
3/13 MEDICAL CALL, 11:30 
pm. A CMU student, celebrating 
Lithuanian independence while 
in his room at Hamerschlag 
House, consumed large amounts 
of vodka, rum, and champagne. 
He became sick and vomited in 
the bathroom for about one hour 
prior to Campus Police being 
called. Three CMU officers and a 
security guard responded and 
assessed vital signs. The student
are presently no openings.
For now, Slater appreciates the 
fact that he has work. And as far m 
as looking back to the lakeside 
home he left in Georgia, I still v 
feel I did the right thing by movingup here. Family is very impor
tant. He admires Pittsburghs

Paramedics were called at 12:34

paramedic crew chief felt that no 
medical care or transport was 
necessary. The student was placed 
in the care of his roommate.
3/15 BURGLARY, 10:48 pm. 
A Campus Police officer responded 
to a lockout call in Marybelle 
Apartments. The officer requested 
further assistance because a 
burglary seemed to be in prog
ress. The officer went outside and 
found the window to the apart
ment open and the security screen 
taken down. He climbed through 
the window and removed the 
chain from the door. The apart

ing officers but all valuables were 
accounted for and untouched. A 
neighbor saw a manleave through 
the window earlier.

Vogel wins Ryan Award
continued from page 1
rial interesting all over the spec
trum of students.
Apparently, Vogels theory 
works. And Vogel knows how to 
practice what he preaches.
Since joining Carnegie Mellons 
faculty in 1983, Vogel has won 
two teaching awards: the Julius 
Ashkin Teaching award from 
MCS in 1987 and the Universitys 
William H. and Frances S. Ryan 
Teaching award this year.
The Ryan Award, given for un
usual devotion and effectiveness 
in teaching undergraduate stu
dents, is the universitys highest 
teaching honor and only univer
sity-wide teaching award.
Nominations for the award are 
accepted from every college and 
evaluated on five criteria, accord
ing to Ted Fenton, director of the 
University Teaching Center and 
chair of the committee which se
lected this years winner.
ThoSe criteria are:
Faculty course evaluations 
(FCEs)
Student letters of recommen
dation
8 Faculty recommendations 
Course material such as syl
labi and examinations 
Commentary from teaching 
assistants.
The committee which chooses 
the Ryan Award is made up of 
former Ryan Award winners, 
appointments made by the Deans 
Council and several students. 
According to Fenton, this com
mittee tries to make its choice as 
objectively as possible. To make 
this choice, it relies on written 
recommendations and faculty 
course evaluations.
One of the best quantitative 
measures ofteachingis the FCE, 
said Fenton. We have FCEs from 
a number of years and we look at 
those very carefully when evalu
ating a candidate.
For the 11 classes he has taught, 
Vogels FCE scores have been 
strong, even though he has been 
teaching lecture courses which, 
Fenton says, are harder to get 
high scores in.
Teaching Concepts of Modem 
Physics (an introductory physics 
course for non-majors), Physics I 
and Physics II, Vogel has received 
an average FCE score of 4.27 out 
of 5.0 for his teaching, with a low 
score of 3.68 and a-high score of 
4.65. All of those courses have 
enrollments of nearly 200 stu
dents.
Joy Whittington, a fifth year 
electrical engineering major, 
remembers taking Vogels Phys
ics I class the first semester of her 
freshman year. Dr. Vogel is a 
very good professor, she said. He 
tried to make physics as exciting 
as he could even though he had 
200 students in the classroom.
Dr. Vogel and my T.A., Helen 
Goldberg, made a big impression 
on me, Whittington said.
He really seemed like he liked 
to teach, said Meg McGuire, a 
junior electrical engineering 
major who had Vogel for Physics
II. He always got excited about 
what he was teaching.
Mark Nichols, a sophomore 
majoring in MEMS who took 
Vogels Physics I class, compared 
Vogel to Hugh D. Young, a profes
sor of physics and Ryan Award 
winner in 1965. Vogel has his 
own style  he is energetic and
used a lot of props. Young is more 
sedate, but they are both excel
lent teachers.
Young, who has helped Vogel 
with Physics I and Physics II, 
says Vogel is one of the best teach
ers at Carnegie Mellon. Helmut 
is a superb lecturer and an excel
lent communicator. He makes 
complicated things seem simple, 
said Young.
There is a theory that good 
teachers are born and not made
 that good teachers have an 
elusive set of abilities which al
lows them to relate to other people, 
to see things through others eyes, 
to put on anothers skin and walk 
around a little while, said Young. 
irWell, Helmut has that ability.
Ironically, Vogel, whose re
search expertise is in high-level 
experimental physics, has been 
in Switzerland doing research 
since August and hasnt taught a 
class all year.
He and three other Carnegie 
Mellon physicists are working at 
CERN  Conseil European pour 
la Recherche Nucleaire  the 
worlds largest electron positron 
collider, located near Geneva, 
Switzerland.
Vogel will return to Pittsburgh 
on April 26 to receive the Ryan 
Award but wont return to the 
classroom until next fall.
Speaking slowly and precisely, 
Vogel told The Tartan he was 
surprised and pleased that he had 
won the teaching award. I was 
very happy to win the award, he 
said. I knew that my teaching 
was appreciated within the Phys
ics Department, but it is another 
thing altogether to win a Univer
sity-wide award.
Helmut Vogel, of Carnegie Meilons Physics Department, is the 1990 winner of the University's highest honor 
for undergraduate teaching: the Ryan Teaching Award. Vogel won the MCS Ashkin Teaching Award in 1987.;;'
Vogel said he considers himself 
a self-taught teacher, with very 
little teaching experience before 
coming to CMU. I was a lab T.A. 
for a couple of years at my home 
university in Germany, he said.
I was very soon assigned to small 
classes after I arrived at Carne
gie Mellon and then I was given 
the large introductory courses.
Some of the nice little things 
about winning this award is that
I am not a U.S. citizen, I am not?a j 
native speaker of English and I 
was not brought up in the Ameri
can educational system. This 
honor has given me quite a good 
feeling, said Vogel.
Investigation uncovers no hazing at ATO
continued from page 1
Id be slow to conclude that no hazing 
is going on, said Tom Schneider, a rep
resentative of ATOs national. But there 
are also a lot of stupid stunts that occur 
at fraternities. Members do stupid things 
'sometimes.
There was no evidence in my investi
gation to show that the incident involved 
hazing, said Campana, after having com
pleted his investigation. Campana said 
that disciplinary action was taken 
^against ATO after the incident.
OToole is distressed that incidents 
like this one might set off false alarms 
with regard to hazing. I feel very badly 
that ignorance would cause these kinds 
of concerns, he says. He thinks that 
even the ATO national doesnt yet know 
what happened. I imagine they proba
bly dont know the whole story, he said.
OToole says that a similar incident 
occurred once before. We were warned
I feel very badly that ignorance would cause 
these kinds of concerns. 
 John OToole, 
Alpha Tau Omega president
then, he says. But he said that hazing is 
not an inherent part of Repa. Some 
people choose to get flamboyant or crea
tive in the ceremony, he says. Some 
spin as they jump, others scream loudly. 
But he is confident that there is no part 
of the ceremony that the fraternity must 
hide. I would have no problems inviting 
the entire university to attend Repa. 
Schneider said that the worst thing 
about incidents like this one is that  
regardless of the outcome  they bring 
the fraternitys name through the mud.
ATOs national plans to continue in
vestigating the incident. Schneider said 
he has contacted the University, but has 
yet to speak with the chapter.
After the investigation, said Schnei
der, any disciplinary action taken or 
planned by the chapter will be evalu
ated. He said that the national will only 
step in and take action when it feels that 
the chapter has not sufficiently re
sponded. He also said that the national 
would talk with the chapter about how to 
handle such incidents in the future.
Houses find no place for

Tartan News Analysis
An increase in what 
one University official 
calls undesirable 
activities involving 
the fraternities has 
prompted questions 
concerning the initia
tion practices of several houses on 
campus.
An incident at the Alpha Tau Om ega 
fraternity three weeks ago raised 
questions both in the University 
administration and in the ATO na
tional fraternity that resulted in an
investigation of the Carnegie Mellon 
chapter of the Champaign, Illinois, 
based fraternity.
Though the jury is still out on the 
nationals investigation, Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Ronald Cam
pana is confident that his investiga
tion was conclusive and uncovered no 
evidence of hazing. My investigation 
turned up no problems or evidence of 
hazing, he said.
Hazing, as defined by state law, 
involves activities in which people are 
forced, to do things which endanger 
their physical or mental health or in 
which they must damage public or 
private property as a condition for 
membership in a group.

According to the law, these

tionwide. Were very lucky at 
 CMU, says Campana, because 
 at many schools hazing has be
come a tradition. Thats not the 
; case here.
; Campana says that the Uni; versity is worried about hazing in 
! any form. I dont think we have a 
! hazing problem. Thats not to say 
I we cant develop one. My goal is 
 not to let that happen.
In my house, says Kappa 
SigmaPresidentMikeNappi, its 
not a problem. Nappi says that 
: he believes the incidents that have 
raised these questions are iso
lated ones  like one in which 
! one Kappa Sigma.brother cut off 
a large portion of a drunken 
pledges hair. That incident was 
strictly between those two 
;people, he says. Nappi doesnt 
;think that the persons status as 
a pledge made the incident more 
or less acceptable to anyone.
Despite its anti-hazing policy, 
Kappa Sigma suggests to pledges 
that they refrain from social con
tact with people outside of the 
fraternity for a few days just prior 
to their initiation. Nappi says that 
this is part of the program pre
scribed by the Kappa Sigma na
tional. But the practice is ques
tionable in light of the Pennsyl
vania law which prohibits exclu
sion from social contact as a di
rect or indirect part of fraternity 
initiation.
Theres no hazing at KDR, 
says Kappa Delta Rho President 
Shaun Hong. A lot of places do it

to get pledge unity. We try to get 
it here differently.
Lorrie Rabin, director of Carne
gie Mellons Counseling and Stu
dent Development Center, doesnt 
believe that most fraternity ini
tiation activities are bad. I be
lieve that safe and respectful ac
tivities provide both members and 
pledges with the po^er of a shared 
ritual, she says. Pledges and 
members grow closer to each other 
as long as its playful. Its really 
a matter of having an educational 
period. Ultimately, when pledges 
are initiated, they can believe that 
they belong to the group.
Rabin stressed the need to avoid 
things that are dangerous or ter
roristic. Anything that is de
meaning, degrading, or rude 
would concern me, she says. I 
think people whose emotional 
health is stable could keep some 
distance and join with their fel
low pledges and laugh at it and 
not have any lasting problems. 
People coming in with low self
esteem could have a hard time, 
though. Fraternities should be 
sensitive to that.
I think people who feel that 
they are being abused should
speak up, she says. Take into 
the experience some self-respect 
and a sense of what your rights 
are. If you feel that they are not 
being respected, speak up. Fra
ternities: be careful about the way 
you handle hazing; pledging can 
be fun, but be aware of both 
emotional and physical dangers. 
Two of the largest national fra
ternities have taken the battle 
against hazing one step further 
 both Tau Kappa Epsilon and 
Zeta Beta Tau have eliminated 
pledging altogether.
The elimination of pledging 
wasnt the easiest thing to get 
used to, according to Pete Ibach, 
membership development direc
tor of the ZBT chapter at the 
University of Pittsburgh. At first, 
we were skeptical, he recounts. 
But as the year went on, we got 
more into the program.
Ibach says that not much really 
changed  all of the educational 
facets of the pledge program 
remained intact. Its not that 
different, except that all of the 
dangerous acts were eliminated. 
Making pledges subordinates 
puts them in a position where 
they could be abused by brothI believe that safe and respectful 
activities provide both members and 
pledges with the power of a shared 
ritual."
 Lorrie Rabin, 
Counseling and Student Development
ers, he says. Its very difficult 
for members of the executive 
board to police everything that 
every brother does. By eliminat
ing the pledge program, [pledges] 
are not in that position anymore.
Officers of Carnegie Mellon 
fraternities agree. Nappi says that 
the Kappa Sigma pledge program 
is prescribed by Kappa Sigmas 
national fraternity. All things in 
the pledge program are intended 
to integrate the pledges into the 
brotherhood, he says.
Were all human beings, says 
KDRs Hong. Were all people; 
were all civilized. Why would we 
do it? Were not here to. hurt 
people. Fraternities are here to 
help people grow.
Delta Upsilon President Ger
ald Rubin agrees. Delta Upsilon 
is founded on the premise of non
secrecy and complete anti-haz
ing, he says. Theres absolutely 
no hazing at this fraternity. Its 
not tolerated.
We bring people with a com
mon interest together, says ATO 
President John OToole. Pledg
ing is a time when you get to 
know the brothers and the pledges 
 things you would do with any 
good friend but that are more 
difficult in a fraternity because 
there are many people involved. 
Mike Sophir, director of devel
opment for the Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon national fraternity, ex
plains that the SAE pledge period is an orientation process t 
the operation of a chapter.
Youll find hazing in every facet 
of university life, he says. t 
happens when somebody takes 
something into their own hands 
and it turns on them.
Sophir says that some chap
ters tend to stay in close commu
nication  calling the SAE na
tional weekly  while others 
wouldnt be heard from if the 
national didnt contact them.
We are a service organization, 
says Sophir. Chapters in close 
communication with us tend to do 
well because they are current on 
the issues and are comfortable 
talking about them. Chapter^ 
should not be afraid to talk tb 
their nationals.
Weve talked about this with 
Student Affairs because were 
very concerned, says LaPaglia. 
We depend on them to follow up 
on incidents like these.
But LaPaglia indicated that 
sometimes the problem is not clear 
before serious damage is done. It 
usually takes somethingwith ver 
serious consequences to say with 
sufficient evidence that there are 
incidents of hazing on a campus J

FORUM
Dont spend what you dont have
Money doesnt grow on trees. 
Your parents told you that at one 
time or another. They probably 
said it right after you asked for an 
expensive toy beyond their budget.
Even at CMU, where there 
seems to be a limitless supply, 
money doesnt grow on trees. 
There was almost $500,000 in the 
Activities Fee fund at the begin
ning of the fiscal year, but now the 
coffers are dangerously low be
cause of irresponsible spending 
by student organizations.
Right now only $1,100 in Activi
ties Fee money remains to last 
until June 30. The.fund was effec
tively wiped out when last years 
issue of The Thistle went approxi
mately $7,000 over budget. What 
happens when the next organiza
tion needs a special allocation?
Responsible spending and main
taining a budget are two traits 
which all student organizations 
need to have, but which many 
organizations appear to lack. In a 
school with almost 1,000 students 
majoringin management, it seems 
as though organizations should 
be able to stay within their allot
ted budget.
Obviously, they cannot.
Organizations need to learn re
sponsible spending. Students dont 
know how to handle a budget, but 
it also seems that they dont want 
to be trained. In this semesters 
student leadership seminar run 
by Student Affairs, there was gen
erally an impressive turnout. But 
at the meetings on managing a 
budget, there was low attendance.
It is vitally important these 
spending trends are changed. 
Whenever one organization goes 
into the red and has to be bailed 
out by the Activities Fee, it only 
takes money away from other or
ganizations on campus who need 
the money to stay in existence.
More money in the Activities 
Fee account by way of an increase 
in the Fee would help. It would 
encourage growth of more groups 
on campus, which would cover a 
wider range of student interests.
But raising the Fee is only part 
of the answer. With more money, 
there will be more of a temptation 
for groups to overspend.
Clearly, leaders of student or
ganizations need to become more 
aware of the financial situation 
and become better qualified to 
handle it.
Greek system is not irresponsible

Letter to 
the Editor
We want a team that wins, too
With the resignation of Larry 
Anderson, Carnegie Mellons 
mens basketball program will 
hopefully head in a new direction.
A winning direction.
Andersons seven years running 
the program were commendable 
ones. He brought in quality student-athletes who had both aca
demic and athletic talent.
However, his teams didnt win 
very often. The last time the men 
finished above .500 was five years 
ago, and this years record of 4-21 
was the worst the campus has 
seen in nearly 20 years.
Athletic Director John Harvey 
has said, The most important 
thing is to bring a satisfactory 
experience to all involved. Wed 
like to point out one group of par
ticipants who seem to have been 
ignored  the fans.
We submit that seeing your team 
lose by 30 at home is not enter
taining. Nor is it encouraging for 
the players on the team who see 
their home court advantage 
disappear with their audience.
Attendance at womens basket
ball games has shown that the
student body will support its 
teams, given a reasonable chance 
of being entertained. Its just hard 
to build school spirit behind a 4- 
and-21 record.
Dont get us wrong  we dont 
think the Athletic Department 
should give up the agenda its had 
for a long time. We expect to see 
the University hire a coach who 
will recognize that student-athletes are students first. No one 
here majors in football or basket
ball. Thats why we compete on 
the Division III level.
But we think that its possible to 
combine academic performance 
and athletic excellence. Our sports 
conference, the University Ath
letic Association, has already 
produced two Division III national 
champions this year  the Uni
versity of Rochester in mens 
basketball and Washington Uni
versity in womens volleyball.
Admittedly, were asldng for a 
lot, but we think its possible. We 
can have winning teams with win
ning students. Its up to the Ath
letic Department to hire coaches 
who can make both possible.
Editor:
It seems that many 
individuals have re
cently chosen to use 
the Forum section of 
The Tartan to express 
their own personal pet peeves about the 
existence of the fraternity system on 
campus, or at least the existence of alco
hol and the responsibilities it assumes 
with it. In many ways I commend the 
fact that this tool is recognized as a way 
to get the public to hear an individuals 
ideas, but I am seriously opposed to 
much of the ignorance towards fraterni
ties and also the blatant disregard for 
respecting the feelings and decisions 
made by fellow students in the Carnegie 
Mellon community  whether they are 
Greek or not. So, before I begin my 
rebuttal to much that has been written
and subsequently read about our position 
on alcohol or our general existence, I 
want everyone who reads these words to 
know that the recent frustrations with 
alcohol and Greek behavior have been 
taken seriously and extensively consid
ered. Therefore, I hope that the same in
dividuals who are obviously ignorant of 
many aspects of the Greek community 
will read this letter with as much of an 
open mind as I have read theirs. Espe
cially when consideringthat Ive sat back 
and watched the University name, cam
pus community, and social fraternity 
system of which I am a member and 
believer in, be slandered in malice and 
misguided intent. The most recent article 
written by Goody-two-shoes [CMU 
authorities must prevent irresponsible 
drinking, 3/13] is the one that I will 
answer as the basis of my position in this
letter.
To begin, you wrote Iliked CMU ... 
because of the high number of smart 
people attendingit. My opinions changed 
... CMU, like any other school, breeds a 
bunch of young drinkers.
This reproof is very superficial and 
childish. No matter how you feel about 
us, we are students here. We are all in 
pursuit of an education (go look at the 
all-Greek averages versus the campus 
averages), and are obviously intelligent 
considering that we met the school re
quirements tobe accepted. Insulting some 
of us, or anyone else intelligent on the 
basis of their choice to consume alcohol 
doesnt make sense. There are plenty of 
people who you would consider smart 
who use their freedom of choice in decid
ing to drink. Your personal feelings are

Diversity goes deeper than aesthetics
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Allan Bourdiuss 
letter to The Tartan 
[Diversity establishes 
character, 2/27] offers 
a gross and irrespon
sible representation of the function of 
CMUs Diversity Program and the goals 
of education in general. His spirited 
avowal of individualism is an exercise 
in contradiction and goes far to demon
strate just how crucial Diversity is to 
the curriculum at CMU.
Mr. Bourdius begins by assertingthat 
my principles are different from every
one elses in the entire world  a claim 
he attempts to prove by way of a tedi
ous litany of his various aesthetic and 
culinary tastes, political predilections, 
and other such insights on sundry pri
vate and public affairs. Presumably, this
mundane, predictable collage of commod
ity fetish and male adolescent paranoia 
demonstrates how utterly different one 
white, male, middle-class, American 
student is from the rest of the world. 
Given His self-espoused uniqueness, Mr. 
Bourdius asks, how can you suggest that 
we need to increase diversity?
One might answer Mr. Bourdius ap
peal by first reminding him that diversity 
is not measured by the unique permuta
tions of possible purchases on commodi
ties offered up for fast-food consumption 
in the marketplace of U.S. mass culture. 
Indeed, as his letter demonstrates, per
sonal beliefs and thoughts are not pro
duced in a flash of solipsistic, intuitive 
genius, but rather, are largely given to us 
in ways which are fundamentally social. 
Consequently, it isnt surprising to find 
Mr. Bourdius tastes and positions so
thoroughly informed by the dominant 
ideologies of U.S. culture. He claims 
difference in his bold opposition to the 
Republican majority in his home town, 
and yet he implicitly regards the im
puted Democratic opposition as the only 
political alternative (indeed, judging from 
his account, the only terms in which the 
political can be thought). His represen
tation of the debate over flag-burning 
replicates the typical positions provided 
in the mass media (freedom of speech vs. 
respect for a symbol which allegedly 
guarantees such freedom). The Vietnam 
War is conceived in the trivializing and 
reductive terms of Sports Bar rhetoric, 
as simply a m atter of winning and lo sing. 
Likewise, his positions on the U.S. fed
eral deficit,. nuclear weapons, and the 
Iran-Contra scandal are distinguished

Editor:
I would like to com
ment on legal protec
tion of gay rights. To 
me, there is no ques
tion in the matter; 
every person has rights, regardless of 
their physical characteristics. All people 
deserve to live in peace, without harass
ment, and to be considered equals in 
society. In a country where we claim 
that all people are created equal, this 
should be fundamental; instead, ine
quality is the .norm.
There are many, many people who 
condemn certain ideas based upon the 
tenets of religion. This has been hap
pening since biblical times, as is re
corded in the Bible. Modern day phari
sees, dedicated to their cause, quote 
verses in the Bible which outlaw homo
sexual activity. The Bible does clearly 
state that if two men have sex, they 
have done a despicable thing and shall 
be punished. But even if those two men 
have committed a mortal sin, is it up to 
the mortals to judge and sentence them 
to persecution in lieu of a higher power? 
The Constitution and other laws of this 
country mandate that church and state 
be kept separate. We cannot break this 
basic founding principle of our country 
by allowing religion to be the sole justi
fication for a law, or lack of law.
When I read that people see homo
sexuals as a powerful and affluent
special interest group, I must wonder 
what they mean. Certainly the homosex
ual community gains headlines when
ever something major happens; does 
this make them powerful? There is great 
support for the actions of homosexual 
support organizations such as OUT and 
(on a larger scale) the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force; does their strong 
backing make gay people affluent? There 
are only 50 homosexual public elected 
officials in the entire United States, and 
sodomy is illegal in 24 states -nearly 
half of our 50-state union; is this afflu
ence?
So often we make the mistake of look
ing too closely, fighting and arguing over 
specific elements of issues, and neglect
ing to step back and look at the big pic
ture. The controversy is not really about 
a group of people who have sex in a way 
which most people dont enjoy. The prob
lem is not a group of people who are 
attacking religious values. We are not in 
danger from a group of people who are 
reported to be at high risk for AIDS. The 
focal point of all the controversy is a 
group of people. And people have rights.
So many people are spooked out by the 
subject of sex. This is understandable; 
sex is a spooky subject in a country where 
most parents dont talk to their kids 
enough about sex. But once you get past 
the sex, youll find that homosexuals are 
people like anyone else. Homosexuals can 
feel pain; they bleed, many of them dont
like liver, and youre as likely to find 
them at a Steelers game as in a gay bar. 
In truth, sodomy (traditionally thought 
to mean homosexual sex) is actually de
fined as oral or anal sex; activities which 
are common among heterosexuals as well. 
Some people are uncomfortable with this; 
thats their business. If you dont like it, 
dont do it, but dont condemn other people 
because they do it.
Homosexuals are being persecuted 
even as we speak. Straights go out for 
fun looking for gay people to bash, simi
lar to the practice of lynching blacks not 
long ago. Homosexuals are denied the 
rights to legal marriage, equal housing, 
child care, and employment, and there is 
no place to turn when the prejudices 
push them down. To allow this, in a 
country where all people are supposed to 
be e'qual, is hypocritical. There is no 
threat from homosexuality; the sex 
crimes and spread of AIDS are docu
mented to be spreading through the 
straight population, not the gay popula
tion.
All people deserve equal protection 
under the law, and what type of person 
they are should make no difference. 
Homosexual or not, every person has 
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. Those rights must be pro
tected, and they must be protected now.
Jeffrey D. Brown 
Freshman, H&SS

---------------------------------------------------

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  20 March 19909
Diversity is fundamental to the process of education
continued from page 8
only by their lack of novelty. In
deed, that Mr. Bourdius chooses 
to exemplify his diversity by ap
pealing to the most common top
ics circulated through U.S. mass 
media  the INF Treaty, Coke 
vs. Pepsi, the status of U.S. mili
tary strength  only goes to 
dramatize the extent to which his 
personal beliefs are alreadypredetermined in ways undoubtedly 
familiar to the vast majority of 
U.S. citizens.
Thus, in attempting to prove 
his autonomy, Mr. Bourdius re
peatedly demonstrates how ut
terly impossible it is to express 
any position which is not some
how socially informed. It is this 
connection to the social which Mr. 
Bourdius individualism seeks to 
repress. Sadly, this repression 
takes on a social form all too 
commonplace in the U.S., as is exemplified in his reactionary char
acterizations of those peoples and 
cultures typically marginalized 
and/or made negative in the West. 
The Soviet Union is regarded in 
the terms of an antiquated McCarthyist paranoia, while we are 
treated to the equally offensive 
and residual casting of the people 
of Japan as little calculators. 
Evenmore disturbing is Mr. Bour
dius figuring of sexual orienta
tion as something to be distaste
fully tolerated. Diversity, in his 
sense, would seem to mean be
grudging differences which re
main fundamentally alien, incom
prehensible and potentially 
threatening.
Ironically, Mr. Bourdius is cor
rect to suggest that a productive 
environment for diversity entails, 
among other things, a classroom 
and curriculum allowing for open 
exchange among students andfaculty. Such an environment lies at 
the very heart of what education 
should be, and is not to be taken 
lightly  certainly not to be ex
ploited as a forum for simply 
say[ing] and think[ing] what I 
wanted to and be judged equally 
for it, as Mr. Bourdius would 
have it. A classroom is not a tribu
nal, not a place for the cavalier 
testifying of truth, but rather is 
for exploring truths conditions 
and possibilities  reassessing 
what one already believes, in 
terms of and in addition to the be
liefs of others. Those others in
clude African-Americans, women, 
lesbians and gays, peoples and 
cultures of the Third World, work
ing people  that is, that over
whelming majority of non-white, 
non-male, non-Western, non
heterosexual, non-bourgeios 
people who have )Deen historically 
and systematically unrepresented
in white, patriarchal, Western in
stitutions. Their inclusion offers 
unique and necessary access not 
only to what we may believe, but 
to what ends and at what cost, for 
whose benefit and at whose ex
pense. Education means think
ing as one listens and not simply 
speaking what one thinks.
So, when Mr. Bourdius asks, 
how do you expect anyone to take 
a diversity program seriously if it 
contradicts everything he be
lieves, I have to answer by re
minding him that learning means 
seeking contradiction, not avoid
ing it. The former bespeaks a 
socially committed and respon
sible will to knowledge, and 
thereby offers the grounds for com
passionate action; the latter be
lies an irresponsible, arrogant, 
and self-serving will to ignorance, 
and thereby negates the possi
bilities for positive social transformation. Education must also 
be the endeavor to unlearn as a 
way of learning.
Finally, diversity does not at
tempt to eliminate differences or 
take away anything from any
one; on the contrary, in providing 
an environment conducive to the 
further articulation of social, his
torical and cultural complexities, 
differences which already exist 
are given a voice and made vis
ible. Their inclusion is not de
signed to ostracize the voice of 
white, bourgeois, patriarchal, 
heterosexual, capitalist culture, 
but rather seeks to enable the 
crucial considerations of how that 
voice figures into a broader, global 
context, the lives of its 
inhabitants, their histories, cul
tures, and experiences.
Diversity is fundamental to 
what it means to be educated; it

program was an unfortunate oversight, and 
as chairpeople, Jim and I extend our apolo
gies. The Greek community is aware of your 
support, and would like to commend your 
staff for the Greek Sing coverage from start 
to finish  the quality was better this year 
than it has ever been. Again, thank you!
Secondly, Jim and I would like to address 
the community on the letter that appeared 
in last Weeks Tartan. The misgivings the 
hairpeople had with the Student Senate 
iiave little or nothing to do with not receiv
ing funding for Greek Sing 1990. We fully 
understood that the primary reason we re
ceived no funding was that there was no 
honey to give. We also understand that it 
vas very hard for Student Senate to justify 
jiving money to Greek Sing so that the 
money raised could be given back to an or
ganization that they had already voted on 
reducing their funding because of the previtusly stated budget problems. Yes, to fund 
rreek Sing this year appeared to merely be 
eallocating money to Big Brothers/Big Sisrs. Not to mention the whole confusion of 
'hether funding ANY charitable event with 
;he Students Activities Fee was justifiable, 
left the meeting with a crystal clear under
standing of the reasons behind the denial 
and I was even in agreement with them .
However, I also left the meeting with an
other realization. This was that during the 
course of the meeting, I was treated very 
poorly as though I had no business even ap
proaching Student Senate for the money. I 
made no statements in that meeting which 
were not well-thought out or stated in an un
intelligent way. Yet, I was audibly laughed at 
by people who were not in agreement with 
what I had to say. I felt that I had been humili
ated for no good reason, and have since learned 
that other organizations have felt the same 
way after attending the meetings. If Student 
Senate is going to function on this campus 
without the same recurring misunderstand
ings, the attitude and inter-personal skills 
during meetings need to be addressed. Stu
dent Senate is elected by the students to rep
resent the student body, not to create an at
mosphere of unapproachability. I have no 
doubts that eventually, with cooperation from 
both sides, things will run more smoothly.
Furthermore, everything Jim and I printed 
was fact. The line in the program was meant as 
a parody to Student Senates poster policy re
quiring every organization to acknowledge, in 
print, the source of its funds. It was not in
tended to be offensive. For those of you who 
took it as a direct slur, we apologize for the 
misunderstanding. In retrospect, I see that a 
good deal of Student Senate probably felt the 
same way Jim and I felt about the incident 
after both meetings. That in no way was our 
intention, and for that we apologize.

Letter to

Editor:
This letter is in 
response to the 
March 13 article 
Eirene claims 
SEI in internal 
disarray, engaged in weapons re
search.
I am presently part of a small 
community whose focus is peace
making and hospitality. Since 1975 
we have been involved in public 
actions that express our outrage 
at the production of nuclear weap
ons. My concern is not that some
day we could be killed by nuclear 
weapons but the meaninglessness 
that this madness brings to our 
lives. If we can accept the produc
tion of weapons of mass murder, 
and not make halting it even a 
remote priority in our lives then 
we have abandoned humanity and 
the Earth. Evidenced by the numb
ing apathy about us, this lack of 
concern for the preservation of life 
has opened the door to other forms 
of violence towards third world 
countries, resurgence of racism, 
and violence toward women. Ten 
thousand people where made help
less in Panama because one of our 
puppets hadbecome too independ
ent. No public outcry came for war 
dead. This silence has given our

Fraternities sponsor responsible attitudes toward drinking
continued from page 8
that drinking is bad. Why dont 
you explain how you got ahold of 
the magicbook of right and wrong? 
Lots of people drink and whos to 
say that even if they drink so
cially from time to time, they dont 
lose control of being a responsible 
individual  wheres the line? 
One drink could do that depend
ing on your personality and toler
ance.
You say you have complaints 
iabout your feelings being disre
spected (i.e., people who vomit in 
your dorm, whom you dont al
ways have proof were at a frater
nity), but you showed disrespect 
to us with the high-and-mighty 
tone your letter took. Remember 
that we are your peers, and in 
many cases, will be your col
leagues on academic endeavors. 
Being approximately one-third of 
the undergraduate community, 
insults are far reaching. Just 
think if we all wrote letters about 
ur concerns and wants, crying 
like children about what we dont 
want to see or hear anymore and 
demanding that the problems of 
he world go away because we 
ant them to. Things arent as 
|bad as you think, and here, fia}ly, are some facts to think 
[about.
The Greek community is very 
^sponsible about the way in 
which it deals with alcohol and 
the ramifications of its uses. In
fact, many of the policies that the 
national offices of the fraternities 
on this campus have adopted are 
very strict and detailed toward 
these issues. More strict in fact 
than the polices taken by respon
sible adult male clubs like Lions 
and Kiwanis (your wholesome 
father may belong to one). If you, 
or any of the other individuals 
who have had so much to say, 
would sit down and read our risk 
management literature on alco
hol use and abuse, or even sit 
down and talk to a Greek, you 
would know that responsible 
measures are being taken and 
enforced. We care abqut what goes 
on in our houses. Whether that 
concern is of legal or social aware
ness, we still care about the people 
who come to our parties, and we 
care about each other. There are 
many ways that this can be seen. 
All of the houses on this campus 
serve alternative beverages, re
tain and exercise the right to ref
use admittance or serve alcohol 
to guests, provide escorts and 
attendants to individuals who 
have consumed alcohol and do 
not feel safe, and in some cases, 
houses even provide places to rest 
until the effects have worn off.
When there is the possibility 
that alcoholic beverages other 
than beer will be served at an 
event, open invitations or poster
ing are not allowed (a CFP pol
icy). The guests who attend are
friends of the members of the 
house or have been given invita
tions that represent a houses 
position in accepting the respon
sibility of its actions. Remember, 
there are fourteen fraternities on 
this campus. Each one is differ
ent than the next, so people have 
the right to choose to be at the one 
in which they feel most comfort
able or safe should they choose to 
attend anything a house does at 
all.
I now wish to address the pos
tering issue. Granted, Student 
Affairs has its own policies about 
postering. The Council of Frater
nity Presidents (all the Greek 
houses) has recognized them, re
spects them, and has incorporated 
them within its own. But let me 
say that Student Affairs does not 
have a policy of issuing fines or 
forcing the removal of posters that 
suggest or state the consumption 
or serving of alcohol. CFP does, 
and it feels very strongly about 
enforcing it. If you would just look 
around and stop zeroing in on and 
verbally abusing the fraternities, 
you would see that Student Af
fairs allows non-Greeks to hang 
posters that openly invite anyone 
to off-campus parties  giving 
rise to a variety of unsafe situ
ations. For instance, off-campus 
parties take place in an environ
ment that cannot be patrolled by 
Campus Security, making the 
transit between the campus and
party potentially dangerous 
(especially if intoxicated). In 
addition, these kinds of parties 
are open to crashing by non
college students, another poten
tial danger. These posters are 
even allowed to advertise pricing 
that suggest the subsequent sale 
of alcohol, to minors or adults, by 
having cover charges. Since you 
like to cite the Pennsylvania liq
uor laws, you should also know 
the one that forbids the sale of 
alcohol without a license (some
thing we dont do).
Fraternities posters are kept 
as novelty items, comedic ads that 
in some cases have small follow
ings of people who eagerly await 
the next poster so it can be added 
to their collection. These things 
represent pride, whether to the 
individuals who collect them or to 
the individuals \yho draw them. 
But in no way have recent ones 
suggested alcohol or will they be 
suggesting alcohol in the future. 
Youre wrong.
Lastly, when people attend 
parties, they are not forced to 
drink. We do not even suggest 
they consume alcohol if they dont 
want to. Many do not, and still 
have a good time and return. 
Fraternities are not like Animal 
House anymore. I am assuming 
from your tone that you are not 
Greek; therefore, I would like to 
say that if you were a member you 
would know that things are dif
ferent. Especially considering 
present-day enforcement policies 
compared to several years ago  
particularly on this campus! 
When I was in high school, I could 
get into CMU Greek parties and 
drink  people even drank out
side. Now, none of that is pos
sible.
Also, just to clear up yet an
other point, the University has 
played a very active role in work
ing with us to develop new ways 
to be even more responsible and 
has provided great service in 
helping us to enforce our policies.
Taking all of what you said into 
consideration, you and many 
others obviously dont know what 
is going on. So please, before you 
speak, take the time learn about 
what you are saying. If you or 
anyone else want to debate any of 
this, or would like a first-hand 
look at what goes on, come over to 
our side, try to rush somewhere 
(incidentally, Rush is dry, and 
has been for 2 years), and see 
what its like to be a Greek. The 
worst that could happen is that 
you find Greek life isnt for you. 
But then again, you may have 
some fun and make friends that 
youll have forever. Youll see and 
hear what we go through just to 
have a good timewhether alco
hol is involved or not. Youll under
stand the difficult and costly 
choices we make to provide an 
opportunity for people to have a
good time with us and with each 
other. We do it because everyone 
likes to have fun and should be 
able to have a place to express 
this. This is what being a social 
fraternity is all about. You and 
anyone else who doubt us should 
get to know us before blindly 
subscribing to outside ideas and 
comments about the things we 
do.
This is America, where people 
have the right to free choice with 
what they would like to do, say, 
feel, or believe. Remember that. 
We are exercising our free choice 
to have fun and however some of 
us choose to do it, we are not 
forcing it on anyone. If the people 
who choose to act foolishly do so 
at our expense, it hurts us. Even 
if some of those people are not 
Greeks, people like you blame it 
on us and say we are at fault. 
Please wake up! Drinking will be 
a problem no matter where you go 
in the States, and considering the 
stress involved with Carnegie 
Mellon, it is an especially big 
problem here. Drinking cannot 
be stopped (as the Prohibition era 
proves), but here at CMU, we are 
taking very serious steps towards 
controlling the irresponsibility 
which, unfortunately, sometimes 
accompanies it.

Democratic governments are expensive commodities
Ortegas defeat in Nicaragua was a 
.brilliant win for the free enterprise sys; tem. I thought that there would be rejoic
ing at the Treasury Department, but all 
. I saw were grim faces.
Why the sadness? I asked Hardin 
Beaver.
 The democratic forces overwhelmed 
the Communist left, and we now have to 
deal with another friendly nation in this 
hemisphere, he wept.
So whats the problem?
Do you know how much it will cost us 
; to get Nicaragua on its feet?
, A lot. Where are you going to get the 
aid?
. We have no choice. Well take it from 
the money we promised El Salvador.
Art Buchwald
Wont El Salvador be upset?
Why should they? The funds werent 
theirs to start with. It was money we had 
originally set aside for Poland. 
Financial aid really moves around, I 
said.
Its not our fault that everyone is 
declaring themselves free at the same 
time. There is just so much orange juice 
you can squeeze out of a kumquat.
Yet it has always been the dream of 
the United States to have a world full of 
democratic countries.
Hardin told me, Not all within a few 
months. Totalitarian regimes dont cost 
anything. Give people freedom and you 
get stuck with one helluva bill.
At least when we gave money to the 
Contras, we didnt have to worry about 
financing an entire country, I re
marked.
Were very mad at the CIA, Hardin 
confided. They should have let us know 
what was going to happen at the begin
ning of the fiscal year.
I tried to defend the agency, The CIA 
cant know everything. All the spook 
agents were squirreled away in the to
talitarian governments. They didnt care 
what the opposition forces were doing 
because they were sure that they couldnt
overthrow a village post office.
The dilemma is that nobody expected 
so many countries to come over to our 
side in one bite, ytere as much for de
mocracy as anyone, but they all expect 
us to build them Disney World.
The only reason that happened, I 
declared, is because the Voice of Amer
ica told its listeners that if they threw off 
their chains, wed pick up the lunch 
check.
Hardin said, Well, were telling the 
State Department to cool it. Weve estab
lished a quota on freedom-loving people. 
Theyre going to be stuck with despots in 
Cuba until we can take care of Paraguay 
and Peru.
That isnt going to make us look too
good.
It isnt a question of looking good or 
not. We dont have enough money for 
park benches in Panama. What do we do 
when the Bulgarians come to us with a 
tin cup?
Turn them over to the private sector,
I suggested. The government cant do 
everything.
What about the loyal 'friends who have 
been democratic for a long time? Do w.e 
cut all of them off from U.S. foreign aid to 
take care of the nouveau free? Hardin 
asked.
If we dont  who will?
Art Buchwald is a syndicated colum
nist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate.
Art is more than pretty pictures
It is unfortunate that so many 
people in this country feel the 
need to attack art that they con
sider to be offensive. Im not nec
essarily talking about censorship;
11 spoke about that in my last 
/column. This time Im talking 
.about the half-wits who go to an 
.exhibit (almost always willingly), 
,, see something that disturbs them 
_.for one reason or another, and 
0then walk away, bitching and
 moaning about the filth they 
~ exposed themselves to. This reac
tion surprises me. Its not every
I day that you willingly confront 
something that may offend you,
 so when you do, wouldnt it make 
..sense to try to understand why it 
s. makes you feel the way it does? I 
think so.
I think if I saw people walking 
out the door of a gallery with 
disgusted expressions after view
ing the Serrano photograph of a 
crucifix soaked in the artists 
, .urine, Id probably jump for joy. It 
would make me happy to know 
L, that maybe, just maybe, the pho.tograph forced them to reconsider 
their own spirituality or possibly 
the actual value of Christianity 
and all other organized religions 
in the late 20th century. In our 
hum-drum society where many 
people rely on mindless garbage 
.like MTV, Nintendo, and comnmercially acceptable films for 
their entertainment, it is nice to 
..know that some art is still able to
Marc Fischer
stop people in their tracks and 
make them use their oft-neglected 
brains.
It was interesting that when 
people heard there was a contro
versial exhibit involving posted 
pornographic photos and a woman 
clad in lingerie in the open space 
in Doherty Hall, everyone rushed 
over to see what the big deal was. 
Personally, I wasnt extremely 
impressed by the performance 
piece I saw there. But ifjust one 
person walked away from the 
exhibit contemplating the way 
women are portrayed by the sex 
industry, something one doesnt 
usually think about in the course 
of ones everyday activities, 
doesnt this alone make the ex
hibit a wonderful catalyst for 
higher thinking?
Unfortunately, a lot of people 
dont think about the positive 
effects such controversial art can 
have. When I saw the exhibit, a 
young secretary walked by shak
ing her head in disapproval, 
mumbling thats supposed to be 
art? Yes, Miss Secretary, Im 
afraid it is. Maybe you might not 
get assaulted by someones utili
zation of free expression very 
often, but as far as Im concerned,
its all the better if you do.
Art that doesnt just let a viewer 
say isnt that nice and walk past 
is appealing to me. I find a lot of 
beauty in art that forces people to 
try to evaluate themselves and 
their own feelings. This is not to 
say, of course, that all artists need 
to work in this fashion. This is 
also not to say that more artists 
who produce offensive material 
for the sake of shock value alone 
are whatis neededhardly. And 
this is also not to say that a Van 
Gogh landscape or a Degas ballet 
dancer isnt an equally wonderful 
creation. There are millions of 
works of art that demand respect 
for their sheer grace and beauty. 
But unfortunately, not every cor
ner of the world is filled with 
sunflowers and ballet dancers. 
Controversial subject matter ex
ists, plain and simple. And unless 
the prospect of living in a sugarcoated, G-rated, Walt Disneystyled country appeals to you, 
Americans are going to have to 
accept that the expression"of ta
boo feelings, emotions, and opin
ions is crucial. So in my opinion, 
art that confronts people in an 
atypically radical manner in ef
forts to induce thought or selfanalysis, is essential  lets hope 
for the sake of free expression 
that we havent seen the last of it.

..With the tumbling of the Berlin 
Wall, the opening of borders, dic
tators replaced by poets, the crum
bling of the USSRs stronghold 
has somehow given people the 
impression that the nuclear arms 
race is over.
During my winter peace vigil

I following week I received a call
 for student activists from the U.
; of Mass. Amherst. There, when 
; the information I released at the 
; press conference was made 
; known, hundreds demonstrated, 
; 70 people closed six campus build\ ings. Peoples outrage was ex! pressed. Outraged by the deceit

! and private citizens concerned

! being used. Requests for infor| mation and dialog since the bej ginninghavebeen refused, there; fore creating the need for public 
; demonstration and civil disobedi| ence.
L What Jim Endres article failed
to do was list the weapons system 
at SEI  systems that Larry 
Druffel says SEI simply transi
tions into practice in support of 
defense systems.
1) Space and Naval Warfare 
Systems Command (SPAWAR)
2) Advanced Tactical Fighter 
(ATF)
3) P-3C (applicable to anti-sub
marine warfare
4) Advanced Field Artillery 
Tactical Data Systems 
(AFATDS)
Last year we revealed 11 vari
ous weapons systems in another 
pamphlet and Provost Jordon 
went on record to affirm our find
ings (notneccesarily our commen
tary). All of our documentation 
comes from hours of research of 
SEI/Carnegie Mellons own docu
ments.
The wall of hate, represented 
by the murderous outcome and 
waste of this military research, 
must be revealed and people of 
good conscience must cry out an 
ancient law that one is not per
mitted to kill, that we are to 
love our enemy. What is being 
taught by Larry Druffel, Dwayne 
Adams, and all of us who stand by 
silently is that military related 
work is ones only ticket to 
economic well being.
When many students look at a 
homeless person they fear the 
same end instead of being stirred 
to compassion to end the eco
nomic drain brought about by 50% 
of our tax dollars for weapons pro
duction and research and the bril
liant minds wasted so that re
search has become the corner
stone of your schools resources. 
70% of that military related. Stu
dents must shake off their apathy 
and squarely tell their professors 
they aint goin to study war no 
more. The wall of hate  the 
military research divides us, 
sets us at odds with our ene
mies and creation. It must be 
torn down. This battle begins in 
our hearts and continues to those 
places that promote death.
In closing Id like to respond to 
the label given me by Larry 
Druffel, that of a profession pro
tester. Profession a) implies I 
am paid to perform my acts of 
protest. Nothing, nothing could 
be further from the truth. I am a 
beggar. Working, driving a truck 
to putfood on our table. Attempt
ing to bring some healing to the 
five homeless that live in our 
hospitality house. Fund raising 
to house several families in the 
winter thru the art show for the 
homeless (whose major contribu
tors are Carnegie Mellon grads 
and students). Soliciting money 
to repair the home of a family 
who is facing eviction if these 
repairs are not made. Presently 
Im facing a year in prison for 
simply sitting down in front of 
SEIs door on Sunday Aug 6th  
Hiroshima Day. I face these 
trumped up charges May 4th and 
expect to receive the maximum.
I dont hope for prison or par
ticularly enjoy facing Pittsburghs 
homeless, imprisoned, and men
tally ill. But there is a love that 
wells up inside me in the midst of 
begging for peace and justice. 
These lies and hate must stop. If 
we continue, the events that will 
transpire will be anything but 
ignorable.
P.S. To talk or for info on SEI 
just call or stop by.

Greeks aren't to blame for booze
O*Editor:
Thisisin re
sponse to last 
weeks letter Letter tO
t*eTTeditor the Editor[ CMU au
thorities must prevent irrespon
sible drinking.] The writer, who 
for some reason requested that 
his or her name be withheld, 
makes a good attempt at stere
otyping members of fraterni
ties as nothing but a bunch of 
young drinkers. What is dis
turbing about the letter is that 
it has no cause other than to 
give fraternities a bad reputa
tion. If the writer would not be 
as judgemental toward others, 
he or she would realize that 
fraternities are much more than 
a group of drunks. Did he or she 
ever hear of Greek Sing? Or 
DTDs Midnight Madness? Or 
the Phi Kappa Theta/Kappa 
Kappa Gamma Dance Mara
thon? These are only a few 
examples of charity events
sponsored by fraternities.
In the letter, the actual cause of 
underage drinking seemed sec
ondary to the attempt of pinning 
the blame on fraternities. I am 
not going to deny that people drink 
at parties, but there are plenty of 
people not involved with fraterni
ties that confine their drinking to 
their room or apartment. Under
age drinking is a problem, but 
fraternities are not the primary 
cause of it. Whether or not a per
son decides to drink is his or her 
prerogative, not a fraternitys I 
cant believe that the writer ex
pects the Campus Police to baby
sit at every party to insure that no 
one drinks. Furthermore, the only 
justification that the writer would 
have for complaining about people 
who have thrown up outside [his 
or her] dorm room is if he or she 
would have to clean it up. Id bet 
the house that he or she did not 
clean it up, but waited for some
body from the university to do it.
By the way, if Go Around the
World on a poster is indeed the 
blatant invitation to drinking5 
that the writer says it is, I won
der how he or she would react to 
the phrase Go Fly a Kite on a 
bumper sticker.
Finally, Id like to ask why the 
writer had his or her name with
held. If your letter is indeed 
what you believe in, you should 
stand up for yourself. There is 
nothing wrong with expressing 
your opinion, but at least back it 
up with something. In this case, 
your name could have supported 
your position. I say this because 
anyone who agreed with your 
letter could have looked at you 
as an example of someone who 
stood up for what he or she be
lieved in. If there were enough 
people that felt this way, maybe 
a change could be brought about. 
But without your name, this will 
never happen.

to deal with it as an individual, 
and be strong. If you cant, youre 
in trouble.
This place has the ability to 
seal people off from each other, to 
make it seem as if the only really 
important thing around is work 
and success. Its an attitude that 
is entirely personal  it is based 
on motivation. There are those 
who feel that college is a place to 
work and prepare for a successful 
business career, to make sure that 
youre prepared for whatevers out 
there.
There are others  myself 
included  who feel that college 
is a place to learn and grow, a 
place that allows you to grow 
internally, as well as mentally. 
Its tough to deal with, especially 
with the amount of work and pres
sure, but youve got to deal with 
it. Find your friends, have fun, 
and dont worry so much. Its that 
simple. But it isnt simple.

figure out how to handle the real

The weather?
Correct. Its going to be diffi

warmth could cripple entire de

serious stress relief, let them go, 
and we may never see the end. 
We might lose architecture all 
together, and ECE will definitely 
stop.
Youre right. We have to do 
something to restrict them, make 
sure they dont get too relaxed. 
Schedule a lot of tests and papers

Drinking problems not 
limited to fraternities
Rich Robinson
Warm weather and 
sun transforms CMU
Inquiring Minds
Stewart Levine
Theres something magical 
about the first day of spring. 
Hemlines go up, people lay out, 
and Physical Plant spreads a fresh 
layer of manure on the Cut.
The calendar says that spring 
does not begin until tomorrow. 
Spring Break doesnt begin for 
another three days. Tell that to 
the thermometer or the people on 
the Cut or the shorts that I tried 
to wear several months before I 
expected to have the correct shape 
to fit into them.
Spring arrived on campus, tak
ing those of us recovering from 
the semester completely by sur
prise. The result  for a week 
Carnegie Mellon wasnt Carnegie 
Mellon.
Instead it seemed like we were 
all attending UCLA, or at the 
very least Pitt. Wherever we were, 
it wasnt our own stress-filled 
campus. No one seemed to mind 
the change.
Those of us who had nothing 
better to do than sit by the Fence, 
and there were quite a few of us, 
were amazed. One friend re-, 
marked, Weve imported an en
tire campus of people here.
He wasnt far off. The area from 
Skibo to the Clock was one length 
of people. People reading books, 
playingfrisbee, even sleeping. But 
most of all, they were happy. That 
cinched it, we were not at CMU 
anymore.
The heat wave didnt make any 
sense. There were no sleeping 
rs that we were trying to
con into coming here. It wasnt a 
time for midterms or finals when 
we couldnt afford any distrac
tions.
Perhaps it was the proximity of 
Spring Break. Most of us were 
goingto get some sunin two weeks 
anyway, so Mother Nature de
cided to taunt us with a bit of nice 
weather ahead of time.
Or maybe God finally realized 
that he owed us a biggie after a 
winter full of snow, rain, and 
Mario Lemieuxs back problems.
But now its gone.
Back to reality; back to the 
Carnegie Mellon we know and 
love. Well, back to the Carnegie 
Mellon we know. The cold weather 
came backjust in time for freerolls.
Unfortunately what Mother 
Nature gives, she also takes away. 
Its back to complaining about the 
weather along with classes, the 
administration, and the food.
So what do we do now? We have 
to survive three more days to 
Daytona, Padre Island, and Palm 
Springs. And you know what? Bet 
you itll be raining and 50 degrees 
in Florida all Week. We already 
got our Spring Break.
Stewart Levine is a second-year 
masters student in GSIA. Hell be 
getting his Spring Break tan in 
Pittsburgh.
It seems like there are a lot of 
things going on lately. Read Marc 
Fishers column for the latest on 
censorship. Right now, Im con
cerned with the anonymous let
ter last week, CMU authorities 
must prevent irresponsible drink
ing [3/13].
The letter is filled with igno
rance and egocentricism. It 
doesnt really deal with irrespon
sible drinking, but instead at
tacks drinking on the whole.
The letter ends challenging 
people to prove that alcohol abuse 
is all right. Alcohol abuse is not 
right in any way, and the writer 
knew this. But the use of alcohol 
is not bad.
The writer has elected not to 
drink. There is nothing wrong 
with that. I have many friends 
who dont drink. My other friends 
and I dont run around calling 
them names, though. It is child
ish not be able to accept someone 
elses choice and harass them 
because of it.
The writer suffers from the 
same thing as those who call him 
or her names. Pushing your views 
on other people because you are 
not comfortable with their choice 
is not right.
First off, CMU does not sud
denly create alcoholics out of good 
high school students. No college 
does. I would say that there arent 
many alcoholics on campus, and 
the fraternities or CMU are not 
responsible for their condition. 
How can anyone say that the 
majority of people who drink now 
didnt drink in high school? Lets 
at least be truthful with ourselves.
I was annoyed at the reference 
to Animal House, a movie that 
created a stereotype which is 
completely off-base today. Yet we 
always have to deal with the ref
erence whenever anyone wants 
to rag on the fraternities.
Second, it is illegal to drink 
under 21, but thanks to the 
Constitution, we are guaranteed 
the right to privacy in our own 
home, as long as we dont infringe 
upon someone elses rights. Also, 
speeding is illegal, so is copying 
tapes or computer software, and 
so is stealing milk crates. I would 
like to see if the writer of the 
letter has not ever done one of 
these things.
Third, fraternities are respon
sible to their national organiza
tion. The University does not have 
the right to restrict what we do in 
our home, as we own (lease) them. 
As a Kappa Sig, my chapter house
is my home, just like my house in 
NJ is my parents home. As a 
note, the University has restricted 
drinking at University functions. 
Fraternity parties are not Uni
versity functions.
Fraternities do not account for 
all the drinking on campus. In 
fact, I would say that they barely 
make up half of it. Take a walk 
through the dorms on a weekend. 
Ive been to more dorm parties 
than fraternity parties.
The writer is also concerned 
with people who drink to excess. I 
wonder if he or she has ever been 
to a party. The majority of the 
people I see are responsible drink
ers who are just having a good 
time with their friends. Sure, 
there are those that go overboard, 
but the writer must be ignorant 
to think these people would have 
a problem finding some other way 
to get beer.
Concerning the Beta incident, 
which probably sparked this let
ter, I dont find it excusable, but I 
do think that the whole story isnt 
known. If the writer is so con
cerned with everyones health, 
perhaps he or she would like to go 
to Beta and give lessons on re
sponsible drinking. But he or she 
shouldnt accuse 4000 students 
because of a few irresponsible 
drunks. The final half of the letter 
is all self-centered: I want this, I 
want that, Im upset because 
people drink and call me names. 
Is every drinker supposed to bow 
down and do what the writer says 
so he or she will be happy? Does 
he or she think that everyone is 
an irresponsible drinker?
Let me clue the writer in to a 
few things. Rush events are dry. 
Campus Police are not our mom
mies and daddies. We are not in 
high school any more. If someone 
cant handle being mature on their 
own, they arent ready for college. 
And if someone is drinking re
sponsibly and isnt causing prob
lems, it is obvious that campus 
police do not have to babysit them. 
They have better things to do.
People get harassed. It shouldnt 
happen, but it does. It will hap
pen whether people are drinking 
or not. I dont believe people go to 
your door, specifically, and throw 
up. If it has happened more than 
once, obviously someone doesnt 
like you. With your attitude of 
moral majority, I cant picture it 
being too hard.
Finally, I drink. Why? Because 
I enjoy it. Just like I enjoy water 
when Im in the mood for it. Man 
(or woman) cannot live on water 
alone, you know.

IM major.

Women's Ultimate swings into spring season
SPORTSPEAK

A senior field 
of dreams
An obscure CMU tradition 
(redundant, isnt it?) began last 
week, the solicitation of ideas 
for the senior gift.
Every year, around this time, 
seniors are called together to 
drink and discuss the senior 
gift. The gift itself is usually 
some kind of permanent fixture 
for the campus which future 
students benefit from and enjoy.
Some previous gifts were the 
Clock, the benches in front of 
Doherty, and plants for the 
would-be University Center.
I am finally eligible to voice 
my opinion, since I have 
sweated and slaved at this 
school and have-thus achieved 
the status of senior (no violins, 
please).
In talking with other seniors 
at the Senior Social last week, 
I found most of the ideas 
centered around sports and 
recreational activities. Over a 
couple of cups of flat Coors, 
some of us seniors brainstormed 
about a future CMU Sports 
Complex.
This complex would have eve
rything. It would serve as the 
example by which all other col
legiate athletic and recreational 
facilities would be compared.
We were all so excited  then 
reality set in. You see, the 
senior gift is paid for by the 
seniors themselves. For five 
years after they graduate, 
former students, employed or 
otherwise, are hit up for contri
butions to pay for the senior 
gift.
Since we estimated the 
complex to cost about $5 mil
lion, we punted the idea.
I just could not believe how 
many people had ideas dealing 
with athletics. Ironically, no one 
wanted any of these facilities to 
be put in the gym. These ideas, 
if implemented, were to be in 
addition to the existing athletic 
facilities.
Two of the most popular ones, 
so far, are for outdoor basket
ball courts or a baseball field.
The gym, even with all of its 
faults, does provide some ade
quate space for basketball. But, 
there is nothing like getting a 
little sweaty out in the sun 
while playing some one-on-one 
or half-court action. The best 
advantage for this idea is that a 
few all-weather hoops along 
with some asphalt would cost 
little, in relation to past senior

Its spring and Womens Ulti
mate Frisbee is in full swing. The 
team is gearing up for some tour
naments in April, as well as sec
tionals, regionals, and nationals.
In its second year, the young 
team started practicing soon af
ter returning for the second se
mester at Schenley Park, because 
of the lack of practice space on the 
CMU campus.
Were shooting for the Ivies 
Tournament at Princeton, said 
Ultimates junior Shelley 
Pressley. The tournament, on 
April 7, is the first major compe
tition for the team. The following 
weekend the team travels to 
Purchase in New York. The team 
may also travel down South to 
Wilmington, North Carolina to 
face a tough University of North
The players are young, and they are 
still learning the ropes. Last year, to 
help it get off the ground, the team 
was allowed to have more experi

season.
Carolina team.
Soon after, on Carnival week
end, the team begins its quest for 
the Nationals in Phoenix, Ari
zona, with sectionals. We expect 
to qualify for regionals, but after 
that I just dont know, said 
Pressley. She cited some tough 
competition out there that might 
get in the way of the CMU women,
such as University of Pennsylva
nia. They are very organized, 
and we always have tough games 
with them. Although most of the 
competitions for CMU are in the 
East, Ultimate is very big out 
West, said Pressley.
Pressley estimates that Ulti
mate Frisbee for women on the 
college level has been around for
about 20 years, and that it has 
really taken off in the past five or 
six years. In its infancy, the CMU 
team is still trying to get off the 
ground, by recruiting more and 
more players and giving the team 
a higher profile.
And the team has made strides 
in its two years. This is the first 
year for participating in section
als, which is encouraging, said 
Pressley. This is the first year 
that we are really competitive.
According to Pressley, a huge 
commitment is necessary to make 
Ultimate a priority. There is a 
big commitment in making it to 
practices and getting to the tour
neys, she said. Practice is so importantbecauseithelpsyouleam 
the others playing ability, and 
pull together and play as a team. 
Presley said there are about 12 or 
13 consistentplayers on the team, 
which is a comfortable level. You
need seven people to play, but it is: 
good to travel with 10 or 11.
Because of its national scope, 
Ultimate entails a lot of travelling 
that can be exhausting and tax
ing on the players. We usually 
leave Friday afternoons, play Sat
urday and Sunday, and get back 
late Sunday, so its a pretty lorfg 
weekend, said Presley.
The team is young, and is still 
learning the ropes. Last year, to . 
help it get off the ground, the 
team was allowed to have moreexperienced, non-college students 
on the team, but that is not the 
case this season.
Besides travelling to competi
tions, the team has other busi: 
ness to tend to as well, i. e. -a 
name. The team is still searching 
for the perfect way to express 
itself. The men tagged themselves 
Mr. Yuk, but the women are still 
looking.
Lacrosse club looks good

Saturdays lacrosse game saw the Pitt Lacrosse Club defeat CMU 11-9.
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon lacrosse team 
played its second game of the 1990 season 
Saturday afternoon against the Pittsburgh 
Lacrosse Club (PLC).
Unlike the previous game against Wash
ington and Jefferson College last week, 
when the team pulled out a 87 overtime 
win, Carnegie Mellon suffered its first loss 
in a tough, drawn-out 11-9 game that lasted 
more than two hours. However, the team 
is setting the Pennsylvania League on fire 
as it still holds a three wins and one loss 
record going back to the preseason.
By recruiting many freshmen players, 
CMU boasts a tremendous depth in all 
three positions. The team, coached by Vice 
President for Enrollment Bill Elliott and 
English Professor Gerry Costanzo, has more 
than two lines in both attack and defense, 
and can feature as many as four different 
lines at middie position.
In Saturdays game against PLC, one of 
the toughest teams in the league, junior 
Rob Kendall scored four goals, including a 
dazzling goal in the fourth quarter when 
he beat three defensemen and shot with his 
left hand.
Also helping in the scoring were grad 
student Bayard Johnson with two goals, 
grad student Scott Johnson with one goal, 
John Seekings with one goal, and sopho
more Steve Ramey with one goal. In addi
tion, freshman Miguel Triay threw in two 
assists in the game.
Playing on the artificial turf of South 
High Stadium for the first time this season, 
CMU had to overcome many injuries sus
tained from the last weeks game, a bit of 
rain and wind, and the experienced PittsThe team is setting the

burgh Lacrosse Club, which consists ofmany  
previous Division I college players. .
After falling behind 5-1 in the first quar
ter, and 8-2 at halftime, the team did not, 
give up as it poured in four unanswered 
goal within the first two minutes of the 
third quarter ignited by the goal from ' 
Kendall.
 Then, both Scott Johnson and Seekings 
scored on the Red play which was originally 
used by the Johns Hopkins team in the 
early 80s. Continuing the struggle, Camegie Mellon starting goalie Peter Vonderli- ' 
eth, a junior, made 23 saves to keep the 
game close the rest of the way.
At one point in the final quarter, Vonderlieth made the save by blocking the shot; 
with his helmet; the ball was stuck in his ., 
face shield, bringing cheers and ac
knowledgement from the crowd. Neverthe-i.. 
less, the game was lost when the PLC. 
attack man scored with two minutes left to 
lift the goal difference to two.
Some of the highlights from the game 
came for the most part in the second half.

Quest for new basketball coach tops ADs priorities
Small, half-court sized spaces 
with one hoop could be placed in 
a variety of places. The frater
nity quad, the plaza in the 
middle of Margaret Morrison 
Apartments, and even by the 
tennis courts are all ideal spots.
But my personal wish would 
be for a baseball field. Even 
though it would cost a bit more, 
a field would be the classiest 
gift the seniors could give. The 
East Campus Project does have 
space for IM fields. But, the 
senior class could give money 
for a scoreboard, bleachers and 
even dugouts and make the 
field an honest-to-goodness 
ballpark.
Students could take time out 
from or between classes to 
watch afternoon ballgames. In 
fact, if we dont build lights 
around it, we might have 
enough for another popular idea 
for the senior gift: a Centrex 
phone at PHI.

Larry Andersons resignation 
from the post of mens basketball 
head coach two weeks ago sparked 
a lot of talk about his past seven 
years at CMU.
But those seven years are be
hind, and the attention now turns 
to the future, and who will serve 
as Andersons replacement.
The Athletic Department is on 
the job, and has already set some
goals and dates in the selection 
process timeline. Although the 
plans are not concrete, Dr. John 
Harvey, head of the department, 
has some pretty good ideas about 
what he wants to do.
So far, womens basketball 
coach Gerri Seidl, sophomore 
basketball player Chris Dobbs, 
and Harvey are the only desig
nated members of the committee 
to select a new coach. They met a 
week ago to make preliminary 
plans, but intend to add on to the 
committee before making further 
plans. Harvey wants another fac
ulty member or administrator to 
be involved, as well as another 
representative from the team.
The committee selections will 
be finalized at the beginning of 
next week. Topping its agenda is 
determining the desired qualifi
cations of the new coach. The 
committee will begin to look at 
applications over Spring Break.
Applications are due by April 6, 
and April 16 is the approximate 
date to invite the top three candi
dates to visit the campus.
According to Harvey, there are 
currently about a dozen appli
cants and 40 contacts. He antici
pates 75 applications in all.
The word seems to be getting 
around really fast, said Harvey.
Also, said Harvey, it is the time 
of year when coaching positions 
are quite flexible. Its also peak 
season for coaches to make 
changes.
As far as how the applicants 
look at this point, Harvey said 
there is a wide range, from high 
school all the way through all 
levels of the college game.
Any of Andersons assistants 
from previous seasons seekingthe
helm will be thrown into the ap:J 
plicant pool with everyone else,A 
said Harvey. If they want to bej 
considered, they can submit * 
plications.
The final decision is set to be; 
made by the last day of classes, so 
the new coach can meet with the 
basketball team before summer 
break.
So while some may dwell on the i 
memories of the Anderson years, 
the Athletic Department is too 
busy worrying about the future 
fate of the mens basketball tearrr 
to lament the past.
Zimmerman compiles accomplishments in first two years
By KATIE CULBERTSON

Sophomore Brian Zimmerman 
has been .busy.
In only the past two years, he 
has managed to compile a long, 
impressive list of swimming 
achievements that would leave 
any electrical engineering major 
and Greek with little free time.
A distance freestyler, Zimmer
man capped off his second year of 
swimming this weekend at the 
NCAA Division III Champion
ships in Wisconsin. His fourth, 
eighth, and ninth place finishes 
in the 200, 500, and 1650 frees
tyle earned him in the All-Ameri
can title in all three events, as the 
top 16 in each event are named. 
Zimmerman swam the 200 in 
1:41.51, finished the 500 in 
4:37.05, and thel650inl6:17.64. 
His 500 time set a new school 
record.
These achievements by no 
means are new to Zimmerman. 
He was All-American in the same 
events as a freshman. Also as a

Tennis, baseball, track launch spring seasons
Schemes counts on new players to help tennis
gy ALIM RAY
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons mens tennis 
team will try to have two success
ful seasons in a 
row with the 
help of some 
new players.
Last year the 
Tar,tans were 
undefeated in 
regular season 
PAC play and 
won the PAC
MENS
TENNIS
tournament by one point. They 
did-not play any regular season 
james in the UAA, but did place 
jixth in the UAA tournament 
igainst tough competition. The
UAA has four teams ranked in 
the top 30 in the nation of Divi
sion III teams.
This season the team will be 
missing last years top five play
ers. However, a good crop of new 
players, as head coach Richard 
Schemes described, will pick up 
the slack for CMU.
The number one ranked player 
is freshman Andrew Lee, who has 
proven himself to be the best col
lege player in Pittsburgh by beat
ing the University of Pittsburghs 
number one player in three sets. 
The number two player, junior 
Haja Rabe, is from Madagascar 
butwenttoapolytechnical school 
in Geneva, Switzerland.
The rest of the teams rankings
are not as clear as the first two, 
but are as international. Compet
ing for the number three spot are 
Amine Tazi-Riffi from the same 
school as Rabe but originally from 
Morocco, and Jeff Blankenship 
from West Virginia.
Freshman Chris Sheehan (from 
Massachusetts) holds the num
ber six ranking at this time but 
there are three people challeng
ing Sheehans position: junior 
Mike Ference (also plays third 
doubles), freshman Anand Chandani and junior Najy Benhassine 
(from Algeria).
Scheines hopes his team can 
repeat as PAC champions, finish 
a solid fourth or fifth in the UAA 
championships, and try to break
our way into a National ranking 
in Division III Mens tennis. 
Scheines also hopes some indi
viduals will obtain good individ
ual records against high ranking 
teams and qualify for Nationals.
The teams schedule is not fa
vorable this year, since most of 
the matches are away, including 
a road trip during spring break 
when CMU plays four teams. The 
Tartans will play three schools 
ranked in the top 20 in the nation 
during the regular season. The 
Tartans will then play four other 
teams ranked in the top 30 in the 
UAA championships, making a 
total of seven top 30 teams. The 
Tartans will also participate in 
the PAC championships.
New coach brings new hopes to baseball club

The CMU Baseball Club hasnt 
iad much cause to celebrate the 
past few sea
sons, but that 
may be about to 
change. For
mer coach Wil
liam Allen was 
replaced by his 
assistant, Neil 
Stoernell, this 
semester, and 
he outlook of the team members 
lasimproved as a result. 
Stoernell takes over the head 
oaching position after serving as 
Jlens assistant for four seasons, 
nd had previously coached 
American Legion and high school
[Stoernell] is making us work a lot 
more on basic things like base run
ning and cutoffs. We're becoming 
more organized and more prepared.  
 captain Warren Flax
baseball at various schools in the 
Pittsburgh area.
Were learning a lot of new 
things on offense and defense, 
said senior captain Warren Flax. 
[Stoernell] is making us work a 
lot more on basic things like base 
running and cutoffs. Were be
coming more organized and more 
prepared.
The increased preparation
seems to be paying off so far. The 
club played a pair of scrimmages 
against Duquesne University, a 
Division I school. Although the 
club lost both games, 4-1 and 
71, Stoernell was impressed by 
the effort the team put forth.
I was pleased with what I saw. 
We held our own against them, 
he said. I was also impressed by 
the turnout. We had 17 guys there
for both games.
According to Flax, the key to 
the season for the team is its pitch
ing. Last season, the biggest prob
lem was a lack of fresh arms, but 
a crop of new players gives the 
team added depth. Freshmen 
James Colaw and Joey Mauro and 
sophomore Fred Edquid give the 
club its deepest pitching staff in 
some time, and junior Matt 
Pampena and sophomore captain 
Mike Gess return from last years 
team to round out the staff.
The clubs fielding remains solid 
as the club only lost one starter to 
graduation, and it will be helped 
by the versatility of its players.

| The mens and womens outtoor- track teams launched their 
seasons Satur
day at the Clar
ion College 
Invitational. 
The meet, 
called an early 
bird meet, did 
not count on the 
regular season 
record. 
The women turned in a first 
ace with the 4-by-100relay team 
freshman Rita Vinod, junior 
Schmidt, and seniors 
larsetta Grant and Jody Burig. 
tdividually, Schmidt took the 
lalf-mile, sophomore Carolyn 
iwe took first and junior Sue
TRACK
Sparks took third in the 3000 
meters, junior Kristin Burgard 
won the 1500 meters, and Grant 
finished second in the 100 and 
200 meters.
Coach Dario Donatelli invests a 
lot offaithinhis distance runners 
to carry the team through the 
season. I think weve got some 
excellent distance runners, he 
said.
However, he is worried that the 
teams small size will keep it from 
showcasing all of the individual 
talent. There are 17 women on 
the team now.
We have 17 events to fill, so it 
is goingto be tight, said Donatelli. 
He stresses the teams wealth of 
individual talent, which unfortu
nately may go unnoticed in over
all results.
In 1989, the women finished
I want to emphasize the PAC, be
cause this is the last one. I want to 
go out of that one a winner. 
 Head Coach Gary Meckley
third in the Presidents Athletic 
Conference (PAC), and fifth in 
the University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA).
Donatelli would like to see the 
team finish first in the PAC this 
year, as it is CMLPs last season of 
competition in the conference.
We have never won the PAC, 
and we would like to go out win
ners, said Donatelli. He cited 
Grove City, last seasons PAC 
champs, as the main obstacle in 
the way of that goal.
As for the NCAA, Donatelli is 
hopeful that one or two runners 
will qualify for Nationals.
The men also placed well in 
Saturdays Clarion Invitational. 
Senior Rich Shipley placed first 
in the high hurdles and freshman 
John Desiderio was second in the 
long jump.
Chris MacGuire finished sec
ond in the 100 and 200 meters, 
and freshman Sean Pempel won 
the 400 meter intermediate 
hurdles.
According to Shipley, the men 
would like to not only win the 
PAC, but beat the record amount 
of points ever accumulated in a 
PAC win.
We should beat it, said 
Shipley, because we have depth 
at the sprinters positions.
Last year the men finished sec
ond in the PAC, due to a lack of 
sprinters, said Shipley. This sea
son, MacGuire, Pempel, junior 
Jeff Illian, Shipley, and Desid
erio fill out the primary sprinting 
spots.
Distance runners, such as sen
ior Dave Supp and junior Gary 
Harrison, also add depth to the 
team. The men also placed fifth in 
the UAA.
Coach Gary Meckley has the 
same goals in mind as Donatelli. 
I want to emphasize the PAC,
said Meckley, because this is the 
last one. I want to go out of that 
one a winner. As for the UAA, 
Meckley does not foresee a win for 
the Tartans, but, we are goingto 
go for what we have a chance for.
Meckley is concerned that the 
hectic spring schedule at CMU . 
will hinder the teams perform
ance, especially since the UAA 
finals will be held the Saturday? 
and Sunday of Spring Carnival in 
Atlanta. Meckley says he will 
remain optimistic if the kids can 
stick it out. Also, some of his 
runners have had to drop out of . 
track due to illnesses and aca
demic difficulties.
The 4-by-100 relay looks good 
for the men this year, as do the 
sprinters, although the distance 
runners are not as strong as they 
traditionally are, said Meckley.

IM wrestling quality reaches new heights in weekends tourney
rBy JASON MCDONALD
! Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
\ The seventh annual Real Man
 wrestling tournament, held Sat| urday afternoon in Thistle Hall,
; set a new participation record as 
; 40 wrestlers and 10 teams took 
\ part in the event; however, Earl 
! Birdy, Director of Intramural 
Athletics, was even more im' pressed with the quality of the 
wrestling.
; Ive watched the wrestling 
{every year, and Ive never seen 
; the overall quality that we had 
today. Every kid could wrestle 
! well, said Birdy. Even the offi1 cials were impressed with the 
1 quality. ,
1 The endorsement of the offi' cials takes on added meaning 
\ when one considers that the offi; cials are top-notch collegiate offi
cials. Next week, theyll be doing 
the NCAA nationals in Maryland, 
so these guys knew their stuff. 
The officials did a really good 
job, added sophomore co-commis
sioner Bill Cheeseman. They ran 
a very fair tournament.
The only black mark on the 
afternoon came in the form of 
injuries, as three competitors had 
to forfeit championship matches. 
Cheeseman felt that poor condi
tioning accounted for the inju
ries, but Birdy credited most of 
the injures to chance.
One guy cut his chin when the 
other wrestler brought his head 
up, and Bills opponent twisted 
an ankle. Those things can hap
pen to you even if youre in the 
best shape possible, he said.
The results of the finals were as 
follows (team affiliations in pa
rentheses):
I wrestled all the way through high 
school, but this is a completely differ
ent thing. It was great just to step 
out on the mat and give it one more 
go.
junior Scott Barnyak
130 lb  Sophomore Praveen 
Bahethi (NROTC) defeated jun
ior George Pyros (Theta Xi), 5-2.
 1401bCheeseman (Bill and 
Robs Team) won by default over 
freshman Jason Christiansen 
(NROTC).
150 lb  Freshman Chris 
Ferrence won by default over 
junior David Liebel (Delta Upsi
lon).
160 lb  Freshman Scott 
Gourley won by default over freshman Michael Aubele.
170 lb  Junior Scott Bamyak (ATO) defeated sophomore 
co-commissioner Rob Frazier (Bill
& Robs Team), 10-0.
180 lb  Freshman Rich 
Austin (NROTC) recorded the 
only pin of the finals against fresh
man Matt Beck (Trojans).
 UnlimitedSenior Gale King 
(Beta) defeated junior Craig 
Caputo (ATO) on the decision of 
the referees. The match ended in 
a 2-2 tie, and the referees used 
elements such as wrestling style 
as the basis for awarding King 
the decision.
Barnyak walked away with 
individual honors as the Most 
Valuable Wrestler, beating out 
Cheeseman and Aubele in the 
post-toumament vote held among 
the officials.
I wrestled all the way through 
high school, but this is a com
pletely different thing, com
mented Barnyak. It was great 
just to step out on the mat and 
give it one more go.
The team trophy went to 
NROTC, but Cheeseman was 
somewhat critical of the format of 
the team competition. The teams
with the most people had the most 
chances to score points, and that!g 
kind of unfair to the smaller 
teams.
Cheeseman sees the Real Man 
tournament as a first move -t<y 
ward forming a wrestling club, 
and perhaps even further thafl 
that. I have a list of about .40 
people who expressed interest in 
the idea, he said. I hope to see 
wrestling reach varsity status 
someday.
Birdy remains more cautious 
about the idea of a wrestling team,,: 
We used to have a varsity wres
tling team years ago, but the I 
practice time involved was too] 
much for a lot of the wrestlers."
However, added Birdy. 
wrestling club would be a g 
idea, and if they were successful] 
at the club level, it could act 
stepping stone to a varsity team.!

UAAs Rochester snags Division III title
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
SPRINGFIELD, OH.  The 
University AthleticAssociation 
received a feather in its cap Sat
urday night as its third place 
team, the University of Roches
ter, beat DePauw University, 
43-42, to win the NCAA Divi
sion III championship. The win 
set a record as the lowest scor
ing final in Division III history.
Rochester came into 
Saturdays final with animpressive list of credentials. The 
Yellowjackets came into the 
game with a 26-5 record that 
included anine-game win streak 
dating back to a February 11 
loss to New York University. 
They finished with a 10-4 UAA 
record, but were an even more 
impressive 16-1 against nonUAA teams. The Rochester 
team forged its title with a per
sistent defense that held oppo
nents to a .385 shooting per
centage over the course of the 
season.
In their semifinal game, the 
Yellowjackets stomped 
Marylands Washington Col
lege, 86-70. Four Rochester play
ers reached double figures in 
scoring as the Yellowjackets over
came an opening 9-0 deficit to 
dominate the game. The Yel
lowjackets would never let their 
lead fall into single digits after 
halftime, and went on a late ninepoint run to ice the victory. So
phomore ChriB Fite, a first-team 
all-UAA center, led the Yel
lowjackets with 25 points and 10 
rebounds. Fite, who would also 
lead the Yellowjackets in the fi
nal with 13 points, would be se
lected as the tournaments Most 
Valuable Player.
DePauw reached the final by 
defeating Calvin College, 81-78. 
DePauw gave a premonition of 
what was to come by holding 
Calvins leading scorer, Brett 
Crist, to only seven points. Crist, 
who scored 33 in his teams previ
ous game and held a season aver
age of 19, shot a meager 3 for 13 
from the floor.
The final proved to be a bigger 
defensive struggle than either 
team expected; DePauw shot .313 
on the game while the Yellowjack
ets fared slightly-better with a 
.380 mark.
During the first half, boti 
teams would lead by as much a; 
five points, but Rochester helda 
1916 edge at halftime.
The second half featured till 
same sort of basketball as rtl)S 
first half, with DePauw pw?l>' 
ing ahead 34-31 with 5:33 
in the game. In the closin! 
minutes, however, both team; 
would display a little more o' 
the offensive flair that the) 
showed in the semifinals. Roclt 
ester took the first step as Mi; 
chael Coleman scored the ganje? 
next five points to give the Ysl' 
lowjackets a 36-34 leai 
DePauws Troy Greenlee hit. 
three-pointer to return the leat 
to DePauw, but the Yellowjackets countered with seven unaivl 
swered points to give them 11 
43-37 lead with 1:05 on tlK 
clock.
DePauw, helped by a mis?? 
layup by Adam Petrosky and. 
missed foul shot by the usuaft] 
steady Fite, climbed back intol 
the game. With only five sec|l 
onds left, DePauw had the bait 
but Petrosky redeemed himself 
by knocking a pass away 
preserve the victory.

freshman Buddy Feitt made 18 of 
25 in a sudden-death shootout to 
defeat junior Lewis Jackson. Feitt 
and Jackson both made 18 of 25 in 
th elimination round. A total of 
47 students participated, nearly 
tripling last years record of 16.
In the foul shooting contest, 
senior Seth Herz beat sophomore 
Gregg Orrill by two shots, 87-85. 
Tti'nior Steve McGowan hit 83 of 
TOO for third place while Feitt 
arid sophomore Mike Petrich 
shared fourth place by hitting 79 
shots each.
In the team competition, 
McGowan and Petrich led Theta 
Xi to the championship with a 
l>387-500(.774) performance. So

;senior Moose Shah. Pampena and 
Edquid should also see time be
tween pitching appearances.
; The infield should once again 
;be anchored by the middle infield 
tandem of Gess and sophomore 
!Mike Petrich, with Mauro and 
freshman Satoru Yamaguchi 
backing them up. The comers will 
see a change of personnel as grad 
student Todd Peterson takes over 
first base for the now-graduated 
Perry Pierce. Third base will fea
ture a time split between junior 
John DAmico and freshman Mike 
Fugaro.
- Senior Doug Petkie will act in a 
utility role. Sophomore Dave Beltz 
ill get the nod as the starting 
catcher, but Fugaro, Peterson, and 
Petkie may also see time at the 
position.
The baseball club opens its 15- 
;ame spring season on April 2 
Against Duquesne, and the team 
[is moving into its final stages of 
preparation.
My main concern is getting the 
jpeople to the games, added 
[Stoernell. One of our biggest 
tfoblems last year was that the 
players couldnt fit the games into 
[their schedules, but if we get our 
iplayers there, we should have a 
good chance of winning.

Seniors response to our student loans has been overwhelming.
Everyone's head-over-heels about 
Pittsburgh National's consolidation 
student loans and graduate school 
loans.
That's because with a Pittsburgh 
National consolidation student loan, 
you can cram all your eligible student 
loans into one* And, with the Student 
Loan Network Consolidation Program, 
you can choose the repayment option 
that gives you the lowest possible 
monthly payment available.
Or, if youre headed to graduate
school and need financing that won't 
cost you an arm and a leg, apply for a 
Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS) 
from Pittsburgh National. With an SLS 
loan, you can defer repayment until 
after you leave school. And our current 
rate is just 11.75%. That's lower than 
most other banks.
So, avoid the crush of higher educa
tion costs after graduation. Beat the 
rush by calling now.

Knabe mesmerizes students at lecture about destructive cults
By KEVIN BARNEYTartan Features Editor The advanced course blew me out of
America the Beautiful.
0 Editors Note: This is the first of 
a two-part series on cults based on 
a lecture given by Fritz Knabe.
What happened here? I had 
taken this course, I had this posi
tive reaction to it, it seemed really 
awesome. I got real excited about 
some things and then suddenly I 
had a crisis to deal with. Lifespring 
was a destructive cult.
Fritz Knabe, a second year 
graduate computer science stu
dent, started his lecture, held on 
March 12, with the story of how he 
got involved in a cult. I gradu
ated from Princeton in 1988. When
1 first got here, I had an experi
ence that a lot of you probably 
had: I didnt know anybody.
Things were going pretty good 
for Knabe. He was meeting people 
and making friends. Around Oc
tober, he organized a rafting trip, 
but by the time the participants 
arrived at the river, rain forced 
tfim to return to campus. On the 
way back to campus, Knabe was 
in a car with a friend of his, an
other graduate student, who told 
him about something he had done 
in California.
He talked about something 
called Lifespring. I was knocked 
off my feet. He had attended an 
adult education seminar, sort of a 
self-help kind of thing called 
Lifespring. You pay money for it 
and you go off and it had just 
turned his life around. He had 
been working prior to grad school 
and just in terms of work and re
lationships, it had an incredible 
effect.
i Back at CMU, Knabe was ex
periencing frictions and tensions 
in another friendship. He talked 
with several other people about 
the second relationship before 
considering Lifespring. I talked 
to a lot of people, then I started 
thinking about this Lifespring 
thing, cause my friend had done it 
and benefitted tremendously. If I 
did this thing, maybe I could re
the water. It was like I had seen the 
light There were so many things I 
had discovered. I had amazing, in
tense experiences about myself.
 Fritz Knabe 
CS grad student
solve problems in this other rela
tionship and who knows, maybe 
learn something else.
Knabe talked to his friend who 
first told him about Lifespring. 
His friend wouldnt tell him ex
actly what went on during train
ing. He wouldnt tell because 
knowing some of the exercises in 
advance would ruin it for me. So I 
started thinking seriously about 
it, but there were some things in 
the way. For me, the major thing 
in the way was that it cost $450.
The fee thathad Knabe worried 
had a money-back-guarantee 
with it. If you went to the training 
and didnt like it, you got $300 
back.
Knabe then decided that it was 
worth the $150 risk and he started 
the training. During Thanksgiv
ing break, I drove down to D.C., 
where Lifespring was. They held 
the training in a hotel ballroom 
and I did it. I came out and I was 
on top of the world. It was incred
ible. I had learned something 
about myself that I had never 
known before.
The training, which he would 
not discuss, changed his outlook 
on life, and in particular his rela
tionships with people. I came out 
of the basic training and I was 
planning on leaving things at that. 
Lifespring has an advanced 
course. I figured I did the basic 
and got what I needed out of it. 
Why should I spend $900 for the 
advanced course?
He did not plan on attending 
the advanced course until he 
started talking with some of the 
people down in' D.C. at the 
Lifespring center. They told him 
that if you thought the basic 
course was incredible, then you 
would find the advanced course 
was just phenomenal.
After Christmas break, Knabe 
went back to D.C. and attended 
the advanced course. The ad
vanced course blew me out of the 
water. It was like I had seen the 
light. There were so many things 
I had discovered. I had amazing, 
intense experiences about myself.
Right away, I got involved in 
their leadership program, which 
runs for about three months. What 
you do is actively go out and inter
role in peoples lives, which .is 
Lifespring jargon for go out and 
get people for training. You do it 
in the sense that I had a great 
time, therefore if thats what I 
believe then I should get the 
people I care for and let them do 
Lifespring.
So I started recruiting for 
Lifespring and all along I was 
thinking that Lifespring was this 
phenomenal Life Improvement 
Center.
Knabes part in recruitment 
soon caused him problems with 
his family. About this time, a rift 
sort of developed between me and 
my parents. It stemmed from me, 
this idea that I was going to drop 
out of grad school.
They were really shocked by 
this because throughout my life I 
had been very active and moti
vated, kind of following this ca
reer path. I really didnt talk to 
them after that because I figured 
that they really didnt understand. 
My perception was that in grad 
school I wasnt making enough 
connections with people. I was 
spending my time hacking away 
at computers, and I figured on 
doing something like high school 
teaching or something where I 
could have a positive influence on 
people.
Knabe continued with his ef
forts at recruiting, and actually 
got one of his friends to enroll for 
training. Spring Break arrived 
and he didnt plan on going home 
because there was a Lifespring 
event and he wanted to be in
volved with it. His mother called 
him and explained that she 
wanted to have a family get-to
gether over Easter. I thought the 
real reason was to bring my 
brother back into the fold because 
he had not spoken to my parents 
for a year or so. I thought this was 
a great opportunity to reconcile 
with my parents. He went home 
for break.
On the second day that he was 
home, four people showed up at
his house. They identified them
selves as ex-Lifespringers. I had 
never heard that term before. ExLifespringer, how could somebody 
be an ex-Lifespringer?
These four people spent the 
next five days talking to me about 
what Id been involved with. They 
talked about their own experi
ences with Lifespring, but they 
didnt leave it at just that. They 
showed me research papers, 
newspaper articles, television 
documentaries, even a 450 page 
dissertation on Lifespring and lots 
of books on cults. I learned to my 
great surprise that I had been in 
a destructive cult and that I had 
been completely unaware of it.
Knabe was convinced by the 
material that the four people had 
shown him. He wanted to get out 
of Lifespring. I felt I had been 
massively deceived. I called up 
my group leader in D.C., I had to 
call her everyday to give her a 
declaration of what I was going to 
do. I said, Dee, I have a declara
tion to make. She said, Oh, what 
is it? I replied, Well, I believe 
Lifespring is a destructive cult 
and I will consider any further 
attempts to contact me as harass
ment.
He has not been contacted since 
that conversation, although he
still receives Lifesprings bi-i 
monthly newsletter.
Spring Break ended and Knabe; 
returned to campus. I got back to 
Pittsburgh and I was like Wow, 
that was a bizarre episode in my; 
life, five months or so. But at the, 
end of the first week back, I had 
my first breakdown. That spring, 
was the most traumatic period.of 
my life. What had happened wasthat Lifespring had indoctrinated 
me into a completely new person-: 
ality after tearing down my old 
personality. After I had rejected 
Lifespring, that cult personality., 
had just crumbled. . I
That kind of left me at ground 
zero. I was completely lost. I had 
no self-esteem and no self-confi
dence. I spent hours, literally, 
crying on the shoulders of my. 
friends, those that I hadnt alien
ated by my constant recruiting;. 
They didnt know what to do. Ittook me all spring to get back on! 
my feet and then all summer, I 
was just kind of getting by. It: 
wasnt until the fall that I felt 
completely normal. It had taken 
six to seven months to get to that; 
point.
In the next issue of The Tartan:! 
How to avoid becoming part of a ! 
cult.

JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
My life had fallen into a rut. It 
had grown predictable. I needed 
variety. So I did what no doubt 
many other Americans in similar 
situations have done. I decided to 
switch my brand of laundry de
tergent.
YessireeBob, 
no more wash 
day blues for 
this consumer! 
I was going to 
switch my 
brand. I was 
going to choose 
a detergent 
which reflected 
my beliefs, 
which complementedmy per
sonality, which 
mirrored my 
very soul. I 
chose NEW 
DAY CON
CENTRATED 
nHHH LAUNDRY 
DETERGENT!
It says that Im a guy of the 
nineties, that I realize the value 
of the dollar, and that I want the 
most for my money. The clear 
plastic bottle represents my clear
headed futuristic vision, while the 
deep blue powder shows my sen
sitive, brooding soul. It was also 
the only detergent which fit in my 
basket.
The enthusiasm which I felt 
upon purchasing this soap of 
soaps, faded rapidly and trans
formed itself into the heebie-jeebies which currently plague me, 
when I brought it home and read 
its label. Here is what it said:
'Warning: Contains monionic 
surfactant, sodium poly
phosphate, protease, andanylase. 
Avoid contact with eyes and mu
cous membrane. In case of eye 
contact... get medical attention. If 
swallowed, drink milk or wa- >r 
and consult physician. Rinse your 
hands after contact withNew Day. 
When washing an item by hand, 
wear rubber gloves. Whenmaking 
a paste rub, use an old toothbrush 
or rubber gloves.
And then, almost as an after
thought, it includes the phrase 
Keep out of reach of children. A 
phrase which has my vote for the 
understatement of the year.
This substance, whatever it may
be, is clearly not soap powder. 
Even to the amateur chemist like 
myself, this label is indicative of 
the fact that this material com
bines the worst aspects of nuclear 
waste and corrosive acid, and 
should be kept as far away from 
the human race as possible.
I am a simple man. I dont want 
much out of life. Is it too much to 
ask for a warning label on my 
soap-powder which does not read 
like the warning label on a canis
ter of plutonium?
Until now, laundry detergent 
was not on my list of things to be 
feared. It used to be on the same 
list as cats named Fluffy and dogs 
named Smooch.
Why does one have to wear 
rubber gloves in order to come in 
contact with this stuff? I spent 
four sleepless nights trying to 
figure that one out.
Two more sleepless nights were 
spent trying to comb through my 
admittedly scant knowledge of 
chemistry in order to remember 
where I had heard of monionic 
surfactant and protease before. I 
think theyre ingredients in a 
rocket fuel, or an acid used in in
dustrial manufacturing, but dont
Tad uocKstader/iartan uawroom Manager
quote me on that.
After six nights without sleep 
things started to become much 
clearer for me (in much the same 
way they do for a paranoid schizo
phrenic). The mystery of the clear 
plastic bottle is explained imme
diately. The powder is put in one 
because it would immediately 
dissolve a cardboard box into 
nothingness.
Why do the manufacturers give 
such a small portion in each 
bottle? Because federal law pro
hibits the manufacturers from 
putting in any more in, for fear 
that the chemicals will reach criti
cal mass. While lying awake at 
four in the morning, staring at a 
perky-looking bottle of instant
death, these things make perfect 
sense. But then again, everything 
makes sense when youre para
noid and awake at four in the 
morning.
I became a man possessed. This 
laundry detergent would, indubi
tably, destroy my dry-goods were 
it ever to be used. There was only 
one solution  I had to destroy it 
before its very presence devoured 
my soul.
Out of a panic motivated by 
simple self-preservation, I hurled 
the bottle out of my window, 
hoping that it would shatter and 
deposit its contents in the nearest 
sewer. But sadly, the bottle was 
child-proof. It simply bounced off 
the sidewalk and back into my 
yard.
I noticed that it jumped onto my 
side of the sidewalk somewhat 
maliciously, as if it were tryingi o 
tell me something.
After that incident, I collapsed 
at my kitchen table into the whim
pering pathetic mass which you 
see today.
Ill be going away for a little 
while. I dont mind, really. As, 
long as I dont have-to do my o\yi>., 
laundry. The cleaners at my new 
home use a little too much starch 
in the collars, but a straight-jacket 
is so comfortable that it doesnt 
really matter.

A Persons Opinion
Room Draw is a process that 
occurs every year in an attempt 
to fairly distribute newly avail
able rooms to students who wish 
to move to different rooms and 
students who are being forced 
out of their current residence.
This year, priority is given to 
students who are being forced 
out of Center Plaza and 630 
| Clyde Street.
| Students are further divided 
; up by classes, with this years 
[juniors going first followed by 
; the sophomores and so on.
With the new dorm being open 
1 for next years students, things
 1 were getting a little more diffuc' \ult.
> Most of the students were de
serting their rooms for a small 
chance at getting a room or one 
[of those five person suites in the 
, [new dorm.
! So, we went out and asked 
'several members of the campus 
community what they thought 
of the problems that occurred 
because of Room Draw.
Scott Luckenbaugh 
Junior, CIT
I think that the biggest prob
lem was the new dorm. The way it 
was set up with the five person 
suites  it will probably be four 
years before anyone else will get a 
chance to get into it. I think its 
fair for you to pick a number and 
based on that, pick your room 
from there. Its all luck. Its good 
because that keeps it fair between 
all the different people.
Howard Han 
Freshman, MCS
I thought it sucked. I think 
that its really unfair to pick a 
number out of a hat. I think it 
should be like a market. Each 
person bids for a room  this is 
what they do in the University of 
Arizona  and the person that 
wants the room the most gets it.
Michael Yates 
Freshman, H&SS
I reserved my room, so I didnt 
have any trouble. A lot of people 
had trouble, though. As far as I 
know, it seemed to go all right. 
Some people got really lucky. Its 
probably about as fair as youre 
going to get.
Ray Lieu 
Freshman, CIT
Well, as I see it, all the money 
i-hat Im paying is going to build 
these houses and as a freshmen, I 
cant get into them. It seems re
ally unfair because without my 
money, I wouldnt be anything.... 
They [the seniors] get to live here 
on my money, and it doesnt seem 
fair to me at all.
Jason Digman/Tartan Photographer 
Ben Bell 
Freshman, CFA
I think its a decent process 
for what they have to do.

contractors. Its main function is 
to determine the effects of differ
ent kinds of surface preparations 
on steel structures in the various 
environments that it tests for. 
Some of these techniques include 
testing for accelerated weather
ing, high humidity, salt content, 
exposure to ultraviolet rays, and 
emersion.
Brendza, a senior biology ma
jor, found out about the job 
through a job posting on the Fi
nancial Aid bulletin board. Al
though he took the job to help 
finance his education, he has 
received much more from it than 
monetary earnings. When he 
began working for Steel Struc
tures, he started out as a manual 
laborer and worked his way up to 
working in the lab where he does 
surface preparations for steel test 
panels, assists lab technicians, 
and performs analytical chemical
experiments. A highlight for 
Brendza was getting to go to the 
national meeting of Steel Struc
tures Painting Council in Hous
ton for a week. What an opportu
nity!
The most surprising thing about 
Brendza was the fact that he is a
related organization like the Steel 
Structures Painting Council. The 
only thing that he dislikes about 
this is that he doesnt get much 
on-the-job experience in his ma
jor.
On the other hand, the good 
seems to outweigh the bad. Ac
cording to Brendza, Working for 
Steel Structures will benefit me 
in the long run because of the 
chemistry lab experience, and it 
also shows that I can work in an 
environment where I have to
assimilate new knowledge that I 
can learn on the j ob and in an area -;! 
outside my current field of study. ...., 
It gives me a little bit of a broader,,[? 
background. ^ *w
He also says that if he ever^.^ 
decides to switch from biology to -eri 
chemistry, he would go into some r*, 
facet of the coatings industry 
because of all the knowledge he 
has gained through his years with  
the Steel Structures Painting, 
Council. ' hw
With all the stress and competi- - ,; 
tion in his major, many people "on 
would find it much easier and -t, 
more relaxing to take a job far - m 
removed from the responsibility zi\ 
that Steel Structures requires, but v, , q 
Brendza used this opportunity to , ta) 
broaden his own knowledge. ,.1*

Psuedo fats are gaining more weight with the health freaks
Recently, a friend of mine 
handed me a page from a recent 
issue of Newsweek magazine. 
The headline read A Heavy
weight Fuss Over Fake Fat. 
Apparently the powers that be 
have come up with a safe (Well, 
who knows about safe anyway, I 
mean, aspartame is supposed to 
be safe, but maybe twenty years 
from now we will all wake up from 
uneasy dreams to discover that 
we have turned into large insects) 
alternative to fat. This wonderful 
newproduct is simply calledSimplesse, and apparently it tastes 
like hell and can only be used in 
frozen products, as cooking com
promises its structural integrity 
(and far be it for us to have its 
structural integrity compro
mised).
Now, lets say that although the 
latter seems to be the case, that a 
rival companyjumps on the band
wagon and perfects a brand of 
fake fat which can be cooked and 
only tastes like, oh, lets say 
purgatory. Unfortunately, this is 
already true. A rival company is 
attempting to perfect a product 
called Olestra, (which sounds 
more like a Greek tragedy than 
an artificial fat substitute) which 
will solve all of our fake fat needs 
into the twenty first century.
I wont name company names, I 
would not want to frighten any
body away from tryingthese great 
new products.
After all, yesterday I was going 
to put a little bit of salt into my 
soup and found myself reading 
the small print on the large
A SAUCERFUL OF JAVI
by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
Mortons Salt canister on my 
dining table. Much to my sur
prise I found out that the trusty, 
time honored Mortons Salt I have 
been putting on my food for the 
last twenty years is manufactured 
by Morton Thiokol. You remem
ber Morton Thiokol, they are the 
people who manufactured the ORings for the space shuttle Chal
lenger.
In any event, we cannot allow 
the fact that the food we eat is 
probably manufactured by those 
least qualified to manufacture 
edibles to compromise our judge
ment. So what if Simplesse is 
manufactured by Monsanto, the 
people who brought us polyester? 
The point is that there is some
thing fundamentally wrong in a 
society in which public demand 
has caused major corporations to 
pursue the noble quest of provid
ing us with a real alternative to 
fat.
I have no illusions about major 
corporations doing that which is 
best for us, but then again, amajor 
corporation makes it possible for 
me to attend Carnegie Mellon, so 
I will refrain from casting too 
many aspersions.
The problem with fake fat is not 
so much that it may cause egre
gious medical problems in the long 
run (after all, Simplesse is but 
an innocuous mixture of egg 
whites and petrochemicals, no, 
just kidding) but rather the psy
chological damage which having 
something like fake fat around 
may cause.
The problem is already mani
fest in our society. We have all 
heard the story of the woman who 
declared Im not addicted to 
Valium, I have been taking it for 
over twenty years. Considerthis, 
if we create a safe substitute for 
fat, what makes anybody think 
that those toward whom the prod
uct is being marketed wont buy 
however many times the amount 
of the product they can consume 
in order to get the same number 
of calories that they would get 
from a single serving of the real 
stuff? If an individual can eat 
three pints of Simplesse frozen 
dessert instead of one pint of 
Haagen Dazs, the outcome is 
clear.
But maybe it is not. Even 
though Haagen Dazs has three 
times (or however many more) 
the calories of Simplesse Frozen 
Dessert, Haagen Dazs has some
thing the others will never have. 
The taste of sin. We have made 
Haagen Dazs the perfect commod
ity, we laud those who are thin, 
but advertise the products that 
will make them fat as if they were 
the forbidden fruit.
Of course, the flesh may be 
strong, but the mind is weak, and f
Haagen Dazs wins out every time. 
The progress can be stopped, 
momentarily, but there is noth
ing that can stop the adamantine 
flood of double fudge.
The fundamental problem with 
Simplesse, the safe alternative 
to fat, is exactly that. It is safe; it 
is advertised as being safe; we are 
told it is safe.
Wrong.
We dont want to be safe, we 
want the risk, we want to eat an 
ice cream product which is not 
only laden with fat but which is 
also manufactured in New Jer
sey. What greater risk can one 
undertake than that? If the big 
companies were truly interested 
in our health (provided that Sim
plesse is truly healthy) they 
would hatch an elaborate scheme 
by which to introduce their prod
uct into Haagen Dazs without 
telling anybody (and they would 
also start using people with 
human proportions in their ad
vertisements).
Unfortunately, what happens 
is that they provide us with safe 
products and then watch us per
vert our eating habits in the vain 
effort to accommodate both the 
safe and the sinful.
The permutations of this are 
endless, they turning eating into 
a day-long equation figuring vari
ables such as If I eat a candy bar 
now and I have a diet soda later, 
they will cancel each other out. 
Somehow, the proliferation of safe 
alternatives to anything has cre
ated a bizarre new form of bio
chemistry practiced by everybody 
who has been made uncomfort
able by their physique but do not
take any other recourse but the 
consumption of safe alternative 
to products.
In this new science, dietary 
products and conventional foods 
are like matter and antimatter, 
cancelling each other out, disrupt
ing each others chemical balance 
and ultimately producing healthy, 
trim, fit citizens who could pass 
the muster in the chemistry de
partment of the Nobel Academy.
Of course, this is one of an 
endless number of spiritual ne
croses to which we are driven by 
the mere fact of being alive in the 
twentieth century.
Recently a professor of mine 
explained that anybody who can 
possibly be well adjusted in the 
twentieth century cannot possi
bly be truly well adjusted in any 
true sense. Perhaps well adjusfc 
edness is an absolute and there.- 
fore unreachable. As for myself,. 
Im going to turn the page and- I 
read the article on non-alcoholia.. 
beer.
By the way, the time has come 
for all of us to strip ourselves 
naked and dance for joy on the 
streets, for I have just read the 
most life affirming news I have 
encountered so far in the course 
of this week. It appeared in the 
latest USA Today, and it conveys 
the almost Bacchanalian delight 
of the cancellation of the new 
Brady Bunch series. We lift our 
legs in salute.

AROUND THE WORLD 
IN EIGHTY BEERS
by William Burky
Editors Note: Pennsylvania Bill 
is a fictional beer connoisseur 
travelling around the world re
viewing beers from various coun
tries.
So, I left off last issue with the 
unveiling of the White Burger. Do 
you remember that last dramatic 
sentence, The White Burger is 
actually...? That last climactic 
lentence has kept you on the edge 
>f your seats for the past two 
iveeks.
The White Burger is actually a 
)inball machine. What the hell 
ivas my grandfather thinking
when he told me about this stupid 
thing? They didnt have pinball 
back in the days of...
Christ!! A loud bang issued 
forth from the vicinity of Bam 
Bam. He had leaned up against 
the wall and it had given.
I helped him up and then we 
both looked at the pinball ma
chine. It looked cool. Wait a sec
ond, it wasnt the White Burger. 
It was the White Booger!!
Hey, Bam Bam, you said that 
this was the White Burger!
Excuse me? You said White 
Booger..
No, Burger.
Booger.
This is getting us nowhere. So 
lets play pinball! I said.
We moved up to the machine, 
took a good look at it, and put in a 
nickel. It must be a good game, I 
thought, since it was really cheap.
I pulled back on the plunger 
and it came all the way out. As I 
put it back in, I noticed the ball 
was white. I punched the plunger 
and the ball went up, through a
mans right ear, out his left, and 
down toward the flipper. Thats 
right, flipper (singular).
Only the right flipper remained 
in the machine and luckily the 
ball headed for it. I hit the ball 
and it went straight up towards 
the head. In fact, it went up the 
nose!
Bam Bam shoutedYou did it... 
you made the white booger shot. 
Ive never been able to do that.
I hadnt even tried to do it. Bam 
Bam must be simple.
Ah... ah... ah... The game was 
convulsing. It looked like it was 
going to sneeze.
Bam Barns cat hid under the 
safe. The noise grew louder and 
louder. Lights flashed, buzzers 
buzzed, women groaned, the game 
jumped up and down.
Suddenly ... silence. An eery 
silence. But the face on the ma
chine was turning redder and 
redder! The machine exploded!
Pieces flew in every direction. 
Even the cat was not safe (even 
though it was under one). After
the smoke and flames cleared 
somewhat, I looked around.
Wreckage. Destruction. Dead 
animals. These are a few of my 
favorite things. In the center 
where the machine used to be was 
what looked like a hamburger 
bun.
I moved closer and found that it 
was. Except it was really stale. 
Maybe thousands of years stale. 
Could I possibly be back on the 
trail of the White Burger?
Uh, Bam Bam, I think there 
might be something wrong with 
your machine.
Wheres my cat?
Wheres your cat? Who cares 
about your cat? Wheres the White 
Burger?
I sat down on a soft cushion and 
put my head in my hands. A good 
pinball machine just exploded and 
all thats left is a stale bun. Noth
ing could make this day any worse.
Bam Bam looked up, My cat, 
my poor cat. I felt a dampness 
entering my pants. I had not wet 
myself!! I looked down at my seat
cushion. It was the remains of 
Bam Barns cat. Was this really 
the second cat that I slaughtered 
for the good of humanity? I puked.
There was a knock at the door. 
We got up and went downstairs to 
answer it.
Hey, mon. Five men, the 
Jamaican Olympic bobsled team, 
were standing outside, with fire 
hydrant sized spleefs (joints) in 
their mouths.
Bam Bam voiced my opinion 
with his next comment. Do you 
have a beer? My cat just died. 
The fifth guy put down an ice 
chest and opened it. Hey, mon, 
youcanhave a Jamaicianbrewski, 
if you go to the Olympics and race 
in the bobsled event for us. We 
just want to sit in the sun and 
smoke our ganja. Snow is cold. 
Jadtoldus to race, but we saw the 
run and it looks dangerous.
My cat died, why not? and 
Bam Bam opened a Red Stripe. I 
followed his lead.
Hmm ... smells like beer. I 
poured some into my handy Kiltie
glass and noted that the beer was 
not noteworthy.
Looks like piss, I said.
Youre right, but then most 
beers do. I dont think Id ever buy 
this beer. I mean, its O.K., but its 
hardly worth the $8.45 my friend 
Ponch paid for it.
Yeah, but its still beer, audits 
not annoying or anything.
The second member of the team 
said, Well, you had the beer, now 
you must race the bobsled.
Next thing I knew, Bam Bam 
and I were on a train to Jamaica. 
I hope we brought enough 
brewskis (its a long train ride 
from Ireland to Jamaica). The 
Olympics sound fun, though.
This feature is provided as a 
service to those members of the 
campus community who are of 
legal drinking age and enjoy 
drinking beer in a responsible 
fashion.

If youre like most students, youre often running on empty when it comes to ready cash.
Thats why weve come up with the IBM PS/2 Loan for Learning. Its easy. Its fast. And 
its affordable.
Interest rates are substantially lower than those of most consumer loans. Just 1.5% above 
the Prime Rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal).
Qualified students (or their parents), faculty and staffcan borrow from $1,500 to $8,000 
for the purchase of an IBM Personal System/2.* The one-page application makes it as easy 
as applying for a credit card.
Pay for your PS/2 in easy bites. Take five years to repay. Choose from two payment plans:
Standard (fixed) or Graduated. Under the Graduated plan, you pay as little as $33.32 a - 
month" for a PS/2 Model 30 286 preloaded with software.
Heres the smart way to get the money you need, for the PS/2 you need. Visit your cam
pus outlet for an application or call the Nelhe Mae Loan Hotline at 1 (800) 634-9308.
Y)ure smart enough to calculate the size of a Hydrogen atom.

CMU is richer for the
AB gets in the swing 
with ballroom dancing
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Last Friday night AB encouraged 
CMU to step out and dance til the wee 
hours of the morning with a free eve
ning of big band dancing with the 
Richard Bray Orchestra.
The Westin William Penn Hotel 
Main Ballroom was the perfect choice 
for such an event. Elaborate chande
liers were suspended gracefully from 
the ceiling and provided a warm, sooth
ing glow. The elegance of the room 
served to speak for the type of dancing 
involvedromantic and creative, yet 
disciplined.
The evening began with dance les
sons open to all  courtesy of Ed 
Vincent, a Pittsburgh dance instruc
tor who teaches private lessons at his 
studio, Gotta Dance! Vincent was a 
friendly and skillful instructor, man
aging to coordinate over 50 people as 
students of ballroom dance. Members 
of the CMU Ballroom Dance Club and 
couples who never cha-chad before 
gathered in a large group to learn the
basics.
Then at 9 pm the soothing tones of 
the Richard Bray Orchestra filled the 
ballroom and couples began to glide 
across the floor. The orchestra started 
out with some slow, easy numbers to 
give beginners a chance to get com
fortable with the feel of the dance.
The orchestra soon pulled out all the 
stops by moving into more difficult, 
upbeat numbers so couples could try 
their toes at the swing, jitterbug, chacha, and rumba. When they moved 
into numbers for the mambo and tango, 
the few, more experienced couples 
commanded the floor as the rest stood 
and watched in appreciation.
Among the dancers were members 
of the CMU Ballroom Dance Club, 
who made an impressive appearance. 
The group was started in 1989 to 
encourage ballroom dancing at CMU 
and other local colleges. The dance 
gave members the opportunity to en
joy their efforts while hopefully gain
ing some new members.
During the evening, Vincent re
mained close by to speak to couples
and even take time to go over steps 
and moves. He was more than willing 
to speak about himself and about the 
art of ballroom dance and answer any 
questions anyone might have. At vari
ous times, he took the floor himself to 
display his marvelous talent.
A slight drawback to the evening 
was the fact that the orchestra played 
many numbers that required a good 
amount of skill to keep up. Many of the 
couples who attended had little or no 
experience with ballroom dancing. 
Therefore, when faster or more diffi
cult dances presented themselves, 
many couples remained off the dance 
floor.
Nevertheless, the room was flooded, 
with enjoyment. The turnout was, 
surprisingly large. While unfortu-; 
nately not many students attended,! 
the dance was open to faculty and staff 
as well, and before long the room was 
full of couples laughing and enjoying 
themselves as they let themselves go 
back in time for a few hours and expe-; 
rience the elegance of ballroom danc-f 
ing.
Dreamgirls rivals Broadway performances
By TERRI KASCH

Youve heard this story before. A few 
talented teenagers from the ghetto get 
together and form a band. Theyre dis
covered by a powerful agent. All of a 
sudden these people are riding a rocket 
to the top of the charts and they have 
nothing but problems in their future.
Youve heard this story before because 
it is a common one, both as a subject of 
the theater and in real life. So if its so 
familiar, how come' Dreamgirls, the 
showy musical running at the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse, manages to be so entertain
ing?
The plot of Dreamgirls leaves little to 
be surprised about. Loosely based on 
Diana Ross and the Supremes, the play 
tells the tale of three young women, 
Effie, Lorrell, and Deena, who form the 
>naive singing group The Dreamettes. 
They make it into the city club scene and 
finally go national, with Effies brother 
C.C. writing their hit songs.
'T?he Dreamettes encounter every imag Theatre Review 
DREAMGIRLS. A chronicle of the lives of three young women in Chicago who become 
backup singers in a rhythm and blues band. Directed by Danny Herman. Starring Virginia 
Woodruff, Natalie Belcon, Vanita Harbour, W. Ellis Porter, Kena'Dorsey, Michael McElroy. 
At the Pittsburgh Playhouse, 222 Craft Avenue, Oakland. Performances Tuesdays 
through Sundays until April 1. For information about tickets call 621-4445.
inable difficulty as they burst into the 
music world. Their sleazy manager Cur
tis, a former car salesman, uses every 
trick to cross racial lines and bring his 
new musical sensation out of the realm 
of strictly black music and onto the 
mainstream pop charts. He starts by 
clipping the groups title to simply The 
Dreams.
One of the measures necessary for this 
crossover is to demote the more-talented 
but less-attractive Effie from her role as 
lead singer to one as a supporting back
up vocalist. Striking Deena Jones takes 
over as the groups centerpiece. From 
here the internal dissent begins, with 
Effie kicking and scratching her way
into the background and eventually out 
of the group.
Effies forced out of the limelight, re
placed by back-up singer Michelle. While 
Effie spends the rest of the show clawing 
her way back to a happy ending, the 
politics of success unfold. Not every dream 
from every person can find a foothold in 
this business and no one emerges un
scarred. Most devastating is Curtis 
revelation that he has lost all of his 
.dreams, referring not only to his hopes 
but to the women who make up The 
Dreams.
Carnegie Mellon students hold five of 
the eight principle roles. Natalie Venetia 
Belcon assumes the part of the prima
donna Deena with plenty of poise and 
glamour. Belcon does a bang-up job with 
her superb voice and glitzy dance moves. 
One of the few criticisms I can think of 
for this show is that Belcons voice is so 
fantastic that it is hard to believe that 
anyone could find Deena to be a less 
talented singer than Effie. Both actresses 
give out a spectacular sound.
Senior Vanita Harbour portrays the 
once-innocent Lorrell whos in love with 
James Thunder Early, an already estab
lished soul singer. Harbour masters the 
difficult task of displaying a loss of inno
cence as the show progresses. Lorrell 
grows tired of Earlys promises that he 
will divorce his wife and so she must 
make the mature decision of a woman 
whos spent seven years in frustrated 
love.
Junior W. Ellis Porter leaves the audi
ence mesmerized with his delightful (and 
aerobic) stint as the flamboyant star, 
Early. During one song, Early levels with 
the audience and tells them that theres 
really only one thing he knows hes got,

Universal unveils 1990 lineup
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
Game theory recognizes only 
about a dozen or so distinct plots, 
but Americans on the whole are 
so ecstatic at the prospect of being 
able to take their minds off their 
bland and fruitless lives that they 
nevertheless lump into writhing, 
squirming, stimulation-starved 
hoards whenever a ticket booth 
deigns to open.
Pandering to this audiovisual 
gluttony, Universal Pictures has 
announced its latest barrage of 
feature films, to be dispensed to 
the public later this year. Behold,
then, the fabulous cinematic 
wonders in store for you in 1990.
Jetsons: The Movie not only has 
a title that courteously avoids 
confusing the moviegoer into 
thinking hes watching reruns at 
home, but features the voices of 
George OHalon, Penny Single
ton, Tiffany, Don Messick, Jan 
VanderPyl, Mel Blanc, andPatric 
Zimmerman in the transposition 
of the beloved Hanna-Barbarians 
to the silver screen. Mel Blanc is 
currently dead, while Tiffany is 
not, and despite the perverse in
justice of this situation, Jetsons 
will be greeted by the nostalgia 
crowd with ardor. Look for it this
summer.
Also arriving this summer is 
Back to the Future III. Its about 
time that Universal apologized 
for the dribbly, anticlimactic non
ending of Back to the Future II, 
and the last installment in this 
more or less gracefully entrillogified series will feature a sizeable 
amount of both rootin and tootin 
in the fast-paced Old West. Billed 
for a summer release, the movie 
predictably stars Michael J. Fox, 
Christopher Lloyd, Lea Th
ompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and 
Mary Steenburgen.

Coming....
No,Im the Walrus!: All those 
who attended the recent Paul 
McCartney concert at the Civic 
Arena will recall that free, 98- 
page color programs were distrib
uted to the audience. In it, Paul
talks about McCartney (Ive got 
a T-shirt I really love), McCart
ney (I still like egg and chips, its 
one of my favorites), and Mc
Cartney (I was the motivator.) 
Aside from naming himself as 
his favorite bass player  Im 
allowed to say that, arent I?  
Macca suffers a momentary lapse 
of modesty and lays claim to 
nearly every Beatles tune, insult
ing George Harrison in the proc
ess: John and I had been able to 
write most of the stuff, get George 
to write one song and write one for 
Ringo, because we figured Lennon and McCartney were the best 
writers and nobody had ques
tioned that.
On the other side of the pop 
globe, Harrison shed a different 
light on his own and the Beatles 
songwriting habits: I had my one 
or two songs occasionally, but 
really I was more involved than
that, George tells Musician 
magazine. George then goes on to 
cite I Feel Fine as an example, 
lamenting I was there for the 
whole of its creation  but its 
still a Lennon-McCartney!
When asked for his response to 
this, McCartney stepped out of 
character and addressed the 
question by talking about him
self. Tell me about it! I wrote 
"Yesterday singlehanded and ... 
the Lennon name comes before 
mine. Its All Too Much....
 Its So Eazy: Ice Cube and Eazy 
E, two of Compton Californias 
more notorious residents, are in 
the middle of a public dispute 
that rivals the celebrated Lincoln-Douglas debate in terms of 
subtlety of wit and command of 
language. Mr. Cube, a founding 
member of Comptons rap en
semble, NWA (Niggers With Atti
tude) has left the group for finan
cial reasons, man. I wasnt get
ting paid. Mr. Cube also went on 
to claim that NWA Manager Jerry 
Heller was taking more than his 
fair share of the groups cash and 
that Heller just makes all the 
fucked-up decisions and gets all 
the fucking money.
Heller says that Ice Cube left 
NWA because of ego friction with 
ex-band mate, Eazy E. The E 
summed up his emotions concern
ing the loss of Cubes companion
ship by saying it means we [the 
remaining members of NWA] get 
more money. Eazy, in an inter
view with Spin magazine, went to 
great lengths to distinguish the 
new NWA from fellow controver
sial rappers, Public Enemy by 
asserting that PE gets involved 
in all that black stuff, we dont.

In a blast from the past, Marvel Comics resurrects Ghost Rider
COMIC RELIEF
By Waseem Hussain
This weeks comics consist of a 
few gems that just might be worth 
your time. Gotham City is hell. 
We are in hell. And I am the-King 
of Hell! proclaims Batman, as 
the next five-part arc begins this 
week with Legends of the Dark 
Knight #6. When I heard that 
Grant Morrison of Animal Man 
and Doom Patrol fame was going 
to be writing with Klaus Janson 
doing the art I couldnt wait to see 
what they would have in store.
Stylistically, this is a very rich 
story, filled with cutting one lin
ers and brutal images. Steve 
Buccatello does an extraordinary 
job with the colors on this story, 
which contributes immensely to 
the grisly mood and tone of the 
story. But its just the intrinsic 
defect in the format of the title 
that limit, and probably will al
ways limit how far it can truly go. 
There is no room for character 
development, for developing sub
plots and an ensemble of interest
ing characters, because every five 
issues the book resets itself.
However as far as plot goes for 
this five-parter entitled Gothic, 
it seems that the Psychopath in 
Gotham City is repeating itself 
for the umpteenth time in the last 
few years. If all you want is no 
commitment reading, and you 
enjoy style over substance, then 
perhaps you might want to pick 
up this title.
Green Arrow #31 seems rather 
dull as Oliver Queen finds him
self embroiled in yet another drug 
war. Its got Grant Miehm as guest 
artist and unless you buy this 
title for maintaining a collection, 
I would skip Green Arrow this 
month.
Theres two new comics making 
their debut this week. From 
Marvel Comics comes the return 
of Ghost Rider. I am Death watch. 
I am your death! cackles the 
newest villain in the Marvel 
Pantheon. It starts off predicta
bly and it even gets downright 
corny, but once Ghost Rider, the 
spirit of vengeance, is reborn, 
the action takes off. The book 
doesnt try to be intelligent or 
serious, its just good old fash
ioned action and violence done in 
the same vein as many of the 
other books of the violent vig
ilante genre.
Ghost Rider could very well be 
the Punisher of the 90s. The art
work is reminiscent of Neal 
Adams and .Bill Sinkiewicz, yet 
Javier Saltares and Mark Texeria take full advantage of Ghost 
Riders motorcycle from hell to 
lend the artwork a kinetic edge 
that distinguishes this book from 
many others on the market. The 
story is interesting and chock full 
of ninjas, high tech weaponry, and 
the Kingpin of crime to boot. This 
could be one book that fives up to
its collectors item label.
Mike Barons latest endeavor 
comes out this week in a five part 
mini-series entitled The Butcher. 
It is essentially a revenge story. 
The family of John Butcher, an 
American Indian proud of his 
heritage, is killed by vile capital
ists who want his fathers land to 
mine for a valuable minerals. For 
ten years he has tried to find the 
murderers and now his search is 
finally reaching an end.
Like much of Mike Barons 
work, The Butcher is a fast, but 
well-paced read. It, too, is high on 
action and violence, but the re
venge angle that Baron takes with 
the book serves to add an extra 
dimension to what would be an 
otherwise Punisher clone. The 
mini-series marks the work of 
newcomer Shea Anton Pensa, an 
artist who has previously done 
bits and pieces of things for other 
publishers. His style is definitely 
unique and has a tendency to grow 
on you. If youve got an extra 
$1.50, perhaps youd like to 
investigate The Butcher, its not 
bad.
This really seems like its been 
the week for the violent vigilan
tes, but there are a couple of no
table new books that are far from 
the blood and bullets of the afore
mentioned titles. CBS television 
announced this week that come 
next fall, The Flash will make his 
prime time debut in a weekly 
television series. If its anything 
like the comic book, its bound to 
be a hit. Flash #38 has the Flash, 
a.k.a*. Wally West, trying to get in 
touch with the spirit of Barry 
Allen, the former Flash who died 
about five years ago. He joins a 
psychic Club Med and ends up 
doing commercials for them. Little 
does he know that hes being taken 
advantage of by a group of con
men (one of whom is supposedly 
his dead father).
Its a plot line you might find on 
any two-bit television show, but 
writer Messner-Loebs adds an 
interesting dimension to it by 
using it as a vehicle to develop the 
Flashs dynamic yet vulnerable 
character, plus it has an interest
ing cliff hanger that might bode 
for the return (spiritually any
way) of Barry Allen! Also check 
out Justice League America #38 
for the return of Gypsy, as well as 
a humorous parody of Spy Maga
zine.
Perhaps the book of the week
has to be John K. Snyders pres-, 
tige format adaptation of Dr72 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the 
very underrated ClassicsIllustrated line of books. It is an 
intense piece of work,with vibrant-, 
original, fresh art that is well1 
worth your $3.75. Definitely check 
this one out. Next week look for 
Adam Strange and Digital Justice. _ 
(the totally computer generated' 
B atm an graphic novel!) Until next * 
week, I am ... Batman.

HOW I MADE $18,000 FOI! COLLEGE BY WORKING WEEKENDS
99
When my friends and I graduated 
from high school, we all took part-time jobs to pay for college.
They ended up in car washes and 
hamburger joints, putting in long hours for little pay.
Not me. My job takes just one 
weekend a month and two weeks a year. 
Yet, Im earning $18,000 for college.
Because I joined my local Army National Guard.
They're the people who help our 
state during emergencies like hurri
canes and floods. Theyre also an 
important part of our countrys military defense.
So, since Im helping them do such 
an important job, theyre helping me make it through school.
As soon as I finished Advanced Training, the Guard gave me a cash bonus of $2,000. Im also getting another $5,000 for tuition and books, thanks to the New GI Bill.
Not to mention my monthly Army 
Guard paychecks. Theyll add up to 
more than $11,000 over the six years Im in the Guard.
And if I take out a college loan, the Guard will help me pay it back-up to 
$1,500 a year, plus interest.
It all adds up to $18,000or more 
for college for just a little of my time. 
And thats a heck of a better deal than any car wash will give you.
THE GUARD CAN HELP PUT 
YOU THROUGH COLLEGE, TOO.

Arthur Giron reflects on his lifes passion
Volumle84 MioU .Is8 K--
Lee Sankowich, who recently directed A 
Walk in the Woods for the Playhouse.
1 B'ecomingMemories had its west coast 
premiere at the South Coast Repertory 
Theatre in 1984, and it was honored with 
the"Los Angeles Critics Drama-Logue 
AWtd for Outstanding Achievement in 
writing.
I According to Giron, Becoming Memo
riesis the story of the lives of the grand
parents of actors I once worked with in 
Minneapolis. It follows five mid-western 
families over four generations.
Giron likes to think of the show in a 
^subtitle he calls Passionate Parables. 
No Stirprise, Giron is about passion; one 
can Hear it in the way he speaks about 
his accomplishments and the people 
whose lives hes touched.
T'he play has music, its funny. [The 
peation of the show] was such a beauti
ful process. I use experimental ways to 
tell very simple things; for example, I 
have characters playing three or four 
different roles.
Becoming Memories has shown in 30
We have the cream of the crop here [at 
CMU]. The mental electricity here is incred
ible  you can almost touch it.
 CMU professor Arthur Giron
cities around the country. Each produc
tion is totally different. I love that.
Becoming Memories recently opened 
at the Marin Theatre Center in San 
Francisco where, incidentally, 
Sankowich was recently named artistic 
director. Girons play Edith Stein will 
open the new Jewish Repertory Theatre 
in New York in December.
Giron has also received a commission 
from Joseph Papps New York 
Shakespeare Festival to write a huge 
play about Central America. Life has 
prepared me for this. He has recently 
completed the first draft, entitled A 
Dream of Wealth.
Giron has enjoyed success with each of
his plays since Edith Stein, including 
Money and Innocent Pleasures. Yet his 
works have remained in the smaller, 
more intimate theaters around the coun
try. The next logical step seems to be 
Broadway; in fact, Giron has had options 
to produce his plays on Broadway, none 
of which culminated into a final product.
However, Giron has become wary of 
the Broadway experience, and perhaps 
with good reason. Becoming Memories 
was optioned by Elizabeth McCann and 
Nelle Nugent (producers of Amadeus). 
They promised great things for Giron 
and his work. What he got, he says, was 
artistic corruption.
They refused to deal with the original
company or the original director, says 
Giron. Walt Disney paid for a workshop 
in New York and they completely de
stroyed the play.... They adde4162 slides, 
they added 30 songs;... The corruption 
multiplies. They wanted things that were 
bankable.
I was kind of horrified, admits Giron. 
I took the work elsewhere. I was cured 
for life of the big-time Broadway pro
ducer. Those people were not producers, 
they were packagers.
Giron also blames producers for the 
deterioration of theatre in this country. 
In the last twenty years there have been 
no major producers. The art of producing 
a play has been lost. There is a lack of 
old-time producers, people who used to 
spend a long time with the cast and the 
writers in a family-type situation. Thats 
what theatre is about  a family work
ing together, for each other. Were miss
ing that today.
Giron has taken on the responsibility 
of giving something back to the venue 
that has given his life meaning, through 
his work and through his students, by
passing down his knowledge.
Im following a tradition in that I was 
given mentorship through teachers who 
to this day are still interested in my 
career. I feel a responsibility to teach my 
students the gold-nuggets I learned.
I believe in training and continuing 
with [students] beyond their training. I 
want to continue to nurture over a long 
period of time. This isnt romanticits 
worked in my case and in the case of my 
students.
I like to set up a kind of harmonious 
environment where students help each 
other. I have no use for selfishness. Youre 
exposing your deepest secrets. You have 
to take risks.
Live the moment. The more choices 
you have, the less trapped you feel. Whole 
new windows will open up for you. Go 
through them.
Becoming Memories will run March 
21 through April 8 at the Pittsburgh

Cats, the musical phenome
non by Andrew Lloyd Webber, 
will be returning to Pittsburghs 
^Heinz Hall April 10-15. The 
show has sold out in all five 
w^eks of its two previous Pitts
burgh visits.
Cats, based on T. S. Eliots 
book of poems Old Possums 
Book ofPractical Cats, began its 
theatrical career .in London on 
May 11,1981. Since that time, 
the show has traveled all around 
the world, making its first 
American appearance on Octo
ber 7,1982.
The first performance was set 
at Webbers festival at Sydmonton, and it was a very informal 
affair. Webber focused on the 
suggestion of a narrative some
where deep within Eliots 
uCefhk
ideas began to flow. Eliots 
M^n In White Spats, the figure 
th4t1was proposed to be the guide 
the cat world, was fashioned
after the White Rabbit from 
Alice in Wonderland.
Things started to fall into 
place and auditioning began on 
an unprecedented scale. A cast 
was formed and after many 
initial mishaps, rehearsals 
started in Chiswick. Several 
weeks later, Judi Dench, the 
actress who was to play the 
first Grizabella, was suddenly 
stricken with a snapped Achil
les tendon. She attempted to 
rejoin the show three weeks 
later but fell from an entrance 
ramp onto several rows of thea
ter seats and hurt herself even 
worse than before.
Elaine Paige came forth to 
take over the role of Grizabella 
just two days before the shows 
first preview. The preview took 
off, the cheers rang through. 
The show was now ready for 
more detailed work to begin.' 
The show has undergone many 
subtle changes since then but 
through it all Cats has become 
one of the most phenomenal 
musical successes of our time.
Robert Plants gsioM Uo8vsis is pure paradise
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor *
The fifth solo album of Robert 
Plant, the Golden Haired God and 
former lead singer for Led Zeppe
lin (for those of you who listen to 
the New Kids on the Block and 
not real music), should be in stores 
today. So, once you finish reading 
this article, run down to your local 
record store and buy a copy of 
Manic Nirvana.
Oh, and while youre down there 
at the record store, do something 
rude to the Milli Vanilla display.
I think that Now and Zen 
tended to be just a little bit re
strained. Where as I think now in 
Manic Nirvana the whole shoot
ing match and show is there for 
all to behold. Its wild stuff, said 
Robert Plant about his new al
bum. I know and you know that I 
: didnt interview Plant for this 
article. I got the quotes from 
another, more famous inter
viewer, but lets just pretend that
 Record Review 
5 555 G,'W 'WD|,',b By
Robert Plant.
I interviewed him.
The first song from the album, 
The Hurting Kind, is a fast tune, 
whose chorus is reminiscent of 
Robert Palmers Bad Case of 
Loving You. Both choruses have 
the guitarist and bassist silent as 
the singer keeps in time with the 
drummer. During the rest of the 
song, both Doug Boyle, the gui
tarist, and Charlie Jones, the 
bassist, do an excellent job of 
jamming with the Golden Haired 
God.
I Cry, a slower song, is about 
a love affair that Plant once had 
with a photograph. Ask no more 
questions about the songI know 
what he means, and I think that 
maybe you know what he means 
without even hearing the song.
The next tune recalls the days 
of Whole Lotta Love, Led 
Zeppelins romantic love song, 
with its poetic lyrics about love. 
Remember Im going to give you 
every inch of my love? Now, the 
romantic love song, Big Love, 
contains the chorus, My big love 
for you, my big love for you. This 
is a really cool tune with a nice big 
drum sound, thanks to Chris 
Blackwell, the drummer.
The following tune on tfie al
bum is yet another slow tune. 
Slow doesnt necessarily mean 
bad, as is the case with The Liars 
Dance, a tune that Plant says 
could hatve fit nicely on either Led 
Zeppelins third or fourth album.
The second side of Manic Nir
vana begins with Wavy Gravy, an 
annoucer, telling the people at 
Woodstock that breakfast in bed 
for 400,000 people is possible. This 
intro leads right into Tie-Die on 
the Highway, a song about days 
when bands were good and beer 
was cheap, thats right  the
sixties. This is also a cool rocking 
tune, but musically it doesnt bring 
images of the sixties back.
The following tune starts with 
a screaming guitar part and like a 
classic Led Zeppelin tune, the 
guitar and lead vocals take turns 
creating audio pleasures for our 
human ears. The title track, 
Manic Nirvana, has a great and 
catchy refrain where everything 
is quiet as Plant drags out the 
word Nirvana in a pleasant sort 
of way.
The third tune on the second 
side, Your Ma Said You Cried in 
Your Sleep, starts out in a simi
lar manner as Zeppelins tune 
Boogie with Stu. It quickly 
changes, but it still remains as 
yet another cool fucking tune.
Several tunes were not put on 
the album although some may 
show up on the B-sides to the 
singles. These titles include A 
Date with the King, Selling 
Fire, and Johnnys Turning 
Green Again. Watch for them.

and postcontemporary fantasies, Universal has sev
eral ventures into the world of humor on the pipeline 
as well. Opportunity Knocks stars Dana Carvey (better 
known as Saturday Night Live's infamous Church 
Lady) and tells the tale of a unfortunate trickster who 
slithers into the upper echelons of Chicagos social elite 
in order to perpetrate his felonious designs. Frank 
Whaley and Jennifer Connelly star in Career Opportu
nities, in which a hapless custodian finds himself 
locked in a department store overnight with an inter
esting assortment of characters. Bird on a Wire casts 
Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn in the threadbare former-lovers-reunited-by-comedic-adventure-crisisplot 
archetype, and Coupe de Ville, starring Patrick 
Dempsey, Arye Gross, and Daniel Stem, follows the 
frenzied and zany efforts of three brothers to deli ver an 
antique car to their mother for her 50th birthday.
Spike Lee, the highly acclaimed (or at least fre
quently forgiven) director behind such efforts as Shes 
Gotta Have It and Do The Right Thing, produced and 
directed the forthcoming Variations On The MoBetter 
Blues, a poignant look at one of mans most profound 
dilemmas: the choice between women and song.
For those of you keen on random action and acontextual fear, Universal has a pleasant assortment of ad
venture and terror-oriented films that will presuma
bly make your adrenal glands do cartwheels in your 
abdominal tract. Darkman is billed as a thrilling 
action-adventure-drama packed with wit and irony, 
stars Liam Neeson, Frances McDormand, and Larry 
Drake, and is liberally doused with stunts and special 
effects. Dwier Brown, best known for having made an 
unimaginable sum of money for playing twenty sec. onds of catch with Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams,
. stars in The Guardian, a film thats more likely to 
unnerve the intended audiences parents than its 
constituents. And finally, Childs Play 2 attempts to 
wring a few more drops of blood from the drained 
theme of homicidal dolls going on rampages of butch
ery.
All in all, it looks like the movie crowd can look 
forward to some reasonably entertaining cinematic 
exploits amongst the usual fodder, and, as usual, Uni
versal can look forward to some gargantuan profits. In 
. either case, this mutually parasitic relationship ac
counts for the prosperity of the greatest medium of 
artistic expression since the evolution of vocal cords, 
and should be accepted with a well-balanced combina
tion of phlegmatic resignation and dull, expectant joy. 
This is Mike, and Ill see you... at the concession stand.

Eddie vitalizes the art of the con. 
Eddie is pretending to be something, and 
then he eventually becomes what he was 
pretending to be  a good, successful, 
honest businessman, says Dana Carvey 
of his new role in the Universal film, 
Opportunity Knocks.
In this new film, Carvey plays Eddie 
Farrell, a street-wise con man from 
Chicago. He and his sidekick Lou, played 
by Todd Graff, make their living off of 
anyone who falls for one of their creative 
scams. They have but one wish in life, to 
pull off the perfect scam that will allow 
them to live their rest of their lives luxu
riously and leisurely. For Eddie Farrell 
that dream is about to come true.
Eddie and Lou go their separate ways 
after accidentally pulling a con job on a 
member of the mob. Eddie, wanting to 
lay low for a while, breaks into the house 
of a vacationing business executive. 
Fortunately for him, he is mistaken for a 
friend of the owner, a successful busi
nessman from Harvard, who is babysit
ting the house for the owner. Eddie, see
ing a good opportunity when it comes to 
him, accepts the identity of a man who is 
the exact opposite of himself.
After some close calls in maintaining 
his cover, Eddie accepts a high-powered 
marketing position within a manufac
turing company. Not being satisfied with 
this already lucrative scam, Eddie de
cides to push it one step farther and scam 
the bosss daughter into falling in love

with him. The problems start for Eddie 
when he loses his own heart to her, and 
actually becomes an honest, decent and 
successful businessman. The ultimate 
con, the con that was to bring yield a 
lifetime of profit, becomes the ultimate 
nightmare because of the imminent re
turn of the owner of the house. n- t
Carvey, as most people are aware, has 
been a member of the Saturday Night 
Live cast since 1986. In Opportunity 
Knocks, besides a successful business-, 
man, he impersonates an obsessive Cubs 
fan and a gas company inspector.
Rounding out the cast is Robert Loggia 
as the CEO who hires Eddie, and ngjycomer Julia Campbell as his daughter, 
Annie, with whom Eddie falls in loye. 
The film is directed by Donald Petrie, 
who is coming from his previous film, 
Mystic Pizza. If you want to see Carvers 
comedic talent and a very funny comedy, 
then Opportunity Knocks is your movie,

After 9-year wait Basket 
Case 2 is still no picnic
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
The drive-in eighties began with the 
classic Basket Case, the story of a horri
bly deformed, twisted, mutilated Sia
mese twin who lives in a picnic basket 
and is very angry about it. It summed up 
the Nixon years for me and many others 
-like me.
And now we begin the 90s with Basket 
;Case 2. Belial has matured. Hes learned 
to:act out his aggression in safer ways. 
He identifies the pfeople whose faces need 
to be eaten before he starts munching. 
And hes falling in love. Its a kinder, 
gentler horribly mutilated Siamese twin 
who lives in a picnic basket.
Why did the sequel take nine years to 
make?
Because its perfect.
America is a different place. Belial no 
longer lives in a loft overlooking Times 
Square. He lives in the attic of a mansion 
in Staten Island. And he has friends. 
Thanks to a fruitcake lady psychiatrist, 
lies the head of the worlds most militant 
minority group. They all have heads like 
giant squashed garden vegetables, and 
they spend most of their spare time in 
Ugly Therapy with the lady doctor. But 
they have one thing in common: They 
hate normal people. And when a smartmouth bimbo reporter for a sleazoid 
magazine shows up to write stories about 
=the freak house, they all get together 
:for a little motivational therapy, followed 
'by some serious molar-sharpening.
The only thing thats just a little bit
shocking about Part Two is that the 
Vomit Meter rating is way way down  
no closeup surgery, no slow-motion facechomping, and a whole lot less blood. 
Reason: the Jack Valenti MPAA Censor
ship Board boys have been slashing the 
slime all year long, slapping X ratings 
on perfectly innocent gore movies, and so 
nobodys taking any chances with those 
Nazis.
Even though its only been nine years, 
it seems like only yesterday that we had 
the world drive-in premiere of Basket 
Case at the Highway 183 Drive-In in 
Irving, Texas, at 2 in the morning. About 
300 cars showed up for it, and the world 
was changed forever. Basket Case went 
on to sweep the Drive-In Academy 
Awards that year and to become the 
most famous cult movie of the decade. 
People still write to me from Austria, 
Sweden, Australia, and some countries 
where the movie has been banned, ask
ing for information on Basket Case. The 
only cult movie more famous is The Texas 
Chainsaw Massacre, and thats probly 
only because its been around longer.
And now theyve made a better one.
It picks up exactly where the first one 
left off, with Duane splattered all over 
the pavement of Times Square. Hes a 
mess, but hes not dead. Duane and his 
twin brother Belial, the twisted mass of 
grotesque muscle with an arm coming 
out of the side of hi$ face, get side-by-side 
intensive-care beds, and all it takes is a 
couple security-guard meals and  
whammo!  theyre out on the street, 
ready to be taken into the care of... Annie 
Ross! The jazz singer and classical ac
tress! Shes working a horror film! And 
shes great.
She takes the Freak Twins to live in 
her mansion on Staten Island and starts 
in on their psychotherapy. She takes 
Belial, out of his basket, sets his slimy 
little intestine body on the couch, and 
says, I think its time we really con
fronted your feelings about your separa
tion from Duane. Belial grunts and
H8-mI-E uf8 FuIi oM ysacum tsau Sw -8IilF ufIu f8&F !88l I..ioB84 Moi I fIl4mVI..84 
.IiLmls FumVL8ib
whimpers. To you it was more than 
losing a brother. You also lost a piece of 
yourself. And when they get to the crux 
of Belials problem, she says, 1 under
stand your pain, Belial, but ripping the 
faces off people may not be in your best 
interests.
Meanwhile, theres a grotesquely 
deformed female Belial upstairs in 
Grannys Freak Attic, and Belial is spend
ing a lot of time parking his muscle mass 
in front of Lady Belials pet bed. Duane 
thinks that, if Belial actually falls in love 
with another mutant monster, then 
Duane will be free for the first time. And 
he has his eye on... Heather Ranray! The 
girl from Mountain Family Robinson and 
Wilderness Familyl The most obnoxious 
simpering white-bread girl-next-door in 
America! He wants to do with her what 
no man has done before. Fat chance.
I dont wanna say anything else, cause 
its one of those movies where anything 
canhappen at any moment, and nothing 
happens where its supposed to. Another 
masterpiece.

gling. Face-eating. Monster sex. Closeup

Duane, for making the second movie 
even after he died in the first one, for 
having even a more disgusting scar on 
the side of his body where Behai was cut 
off, and for slowly going crazy as he says 
I just wanted people to think I was 
normal!; Kathryn Meisle, as the tabloid 
reporter, for saying This story is worth

into battle; Ted Sorel, as Phil the detec
tive, for saying Youre wrapped in your 
brothers shadow! right before Belial 
eats his face off; and Frank Henenloner, 
the director, for making the ultimate 
handicapped-rights film. Four stars. The 
standard for the 90s. Joe Bob says check 
it out.

and thats soul. Porter knocks the audi
ence speechless with his powerful, ener
getic dancing and show-stopping voice.
Senior Michael McElroy delivers a stel
lar performance as the eager-to-please
C.C., trying to learn the ins and outs of 
composing. C.C. falls victim to corrup
tion backstage. McElroys talent shines 
through his remarkable voice that no 
one could ever hear enough of.
Finally, senior Kena Tangi Dorsey as
sumes the role of Michelle, the back-up 
singer who fills the vacancy left by Effie. 
Dorsey provides a little bit of humor as 
her character tries to tiptoe around while 
the others break the news to Effie that 
shes been let go.
The actors who arent in CFA hardly 
stand in their costars shadows. Virginia 
Woodruff plays Effie with all the passion 
and anger that her character demands. 
Her wrenching solo And Im Telling You 
Im Not Going, a brutal and desperate 
outcry, brings down the house.
James Stovall perfectly plays out the 
contradiction in Curtis. Curtis is a sales
man. He can sell you anything and his 
mentality is such that if hes not selling 
you Cadillacs, he might as well sell you 
three women from Chicago. Still, Stovall 
does not fail to evoke some sympathy for 
his character, as the audience begins to 
see him as a victim of his own vision.
To answer my earlier inquiry, what 
makes this show work is the talent. The 
plot has interesting twists and the songs 
have a memorable rhythm, but the tal
ent rides the material through to a tri
umphant finish. Dreamgirls will run at 
the Playhouse until April 1. That gives 
everyone plenty of time to get over to the 
theater and see some performances that 
make even Broadway singers look like 
participants in a high school talent show.

A Taxing Woman
This 1987 foreign comedy centers around a tire
less, single-minded investigator for the Japanese 
Revenue Service. This bungling agent gets more 
than she bargained for when she goes head to head 
with a shrewd businessman who thinks he knows all 
the tricks when it comes to cheating the govern
ment. This sounds like a Japanese version of Drag
net with the female counterpart of Joe Friday in the 
IRS instead of the FBI. It was very popular in Japan, 
so if youre looking for something to do on a Thurs
day night, this could be a refreshing change of pace.

stars in this action-packed, thrilling sequel. After 
spending about 50 years in suspended animation 
shes thawed out and explains to the company she 
works for what happened to her old ship and crew. 
Of course, nobody believes her outrageous story of a 
large, acid-filled alien which killed her entire crew, 
so the matter is laid to rest.
However, over time her company offers Weaver 
her job back, but with a catch. An emergency has 
arisen on the planet where she originally discovered 
the creature and the company wants her to accom
pany a squad of marines back to investigate. After

Look Whos Talking
This movie stars John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, and 
the voice of Bruce Willis. It may not sound promis
ing, but Look Whos Talking is an extremely funny 
look at pregnancy and childbirth, and successfully 
made over a hundred million dollars. Alley stars as 
an unmarried career woman looking for the perfect 
father for her baby. Travolta plays James, a cab 
driver with a zest for life, who ends up babysitting 
Alleys kid. Willis never appears in the movie physi
cally, butinstead vocally. His voice is used as Mickeys 
(Alleys baby) conscience, endlessly cracking jokes 
about everything under the weather.
If you are looking for something to do that re
quires no thought and you can stand the overabun
dance of cutsie baby shots, this is a very funny movie 
that is definitely worth the dollar.

CMU anchors into tradition
On November 17,1900, Andrew Carnegie read a 
letter to the mayor of Pittsburgh at a dinner func
tion. In the letter, he offered to build and endow a 
technical school in the Pittsburgh area.
Originally organized as a group of schools with 
the purpose of instructing a new generation in 
technical fields, Pittsburgh Technical Schools 
quickly grew to become the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. As the Institute of Technology, the sec
ondary schools were reorganized into a true univer
sity designed to benefit the continuing growth of in
dustry by creating a generation of technically 
talented workers.
Today, the main part of the campus comprises 
the 'ship of knowledge/ Machinery Hall, now 
known as Hammerschlag Hall, is the prow of the 
ship, and marks where the campus starts. Originally 
built as an enlarged power plant, its tower masks a 
smoke stack. A bronze ship prow stands behind the 
building, overlooking Panther Hollow. The U.S. 
Navy gave the school this figure head from the 
armored cruiser U.S.S. Pittsburgh as a gift in 1912. 
The school, however, was also given the bill of 
$282.03 for freight costs. Henry Hornbostel, the 
designer of the original campus bulidings, had the 
original idea of placing this 7,000 pound ornament 
behind Hammershlag. He thought a ship's shape 
was the perfect symbol for an institution dedicated 
to launching a new generation.
On the port (left) side of Hammerschlag is 
Industries Hall, which is now Porter Hall. Its 
sloping hallways, at a 4.25 percent grade, are oneeighth of a mile long. They slope to conform to the 
slight slope of the land so heavy machinery can be 
transported from one shop to another  the build
ing was used for industrial education.
Rumor  and the script for the Admission's 
Office's current campus tour  has it that Carnegie 
was thinking ahead when he had "Industries Hall" 
built. If the University failed, he would be able to 
convert the building into an assembly-line factory 
powered by gravity. Oddly, the entrance looking 
out onto Flagstaff was the original main entrance.

Moving back towards the stern, we come to the 
Administration Building, now the front end of Baker 
Hall. It was the sixth building in the area and 
contains a major portion of the University's history. 
Brass tile plates, each engraved with a year, adorn 
the front hall; a new one is added for each graduat
ing class. The monument to CMU's first Director 
and president, Arthur A. Hamerschlag, is located 
here.
At the rear of the ship is the College of Fine Arts 
building. Carnegie believed that technical designers 
would play a large role in continuing the growth of 
industry. It is therefore an important piece of the 
ship, because without the knowledge gained here, 
industry might have a hard time progressing.
Moving around to the starboard (right) side of 
the ship, we come to Engineering Hall, now known 
as Doherty Hall. Doherty slopes much in the same 
way as Porter does, and for the same reason. Engi
neering equipment was large and cumbersome, so 
instead of terraced steps, the architects chose to 
slope the hallways. The reason walking through 
Doherty is such a trick is because it was built in two 
parts. The first part opened in 1909, but the front 
part of the building didn't open until 1949.
Wean Hall, originally known as Science Hall, is 
the latest addition to the ship of knowledge. It com
pletes the starboard side and finishes enclosing the 
ship. Designed by Dahlen K. Ritchey, a '32 gradu
ate, it adds a touch of modernism to the otherwise 
more traditional looking buildings.
The Ship of Knowledge has done a lot of grow
ing since those first few buildings went up and the 
first 120 students registered for classes. Strange 
events have grown into traditions, and then disap
peared into the abyss of history.
We dug up some of those traditions, some 
events that have happened along the way, and some 
things now around this campus that are simply 
hidden treasures.

Spring Carnival : The traditions continue
Spring Carnival began in 1920 as "Campus 
Week," a three-day celebration intended to welcome 
alumni back to campus each May. Undergrads 
helped provide the entertainment, and by 1926 had 
become so enthusiastic about the entire thing that 
they spent more time preparing for the event than 
attending to their studies, according to Arthur 
Wilson Tarbell's 1937 The Story of Carnegie Tech.
"The years 1927 and 1928 were nightmares in 
the life of the Campus Week celebration," says the 
1935 Thistle, "for the alumni decided to delete it 
from the list of student activities and to run it 
exclusively for themselves."
After 1928, the administration cancelled Campus 
Week in favor of an activity which would take place 
in the fall and include a football game, like home
coming. A year later, the fall event had yet to take 
place, and Student Council petitioned the admini
stration to excuse the students from their studies in 
May so the May event could be reinstated. The 
request was granted on the condition that there 
would be only a two day respite; the event was 
reinstated in 1930 and renamed "Spring Carnival."
Buggy began separately from Carnival in 1921, 
when a group of engineering students from different 
fraternities decided to build go-carts for a soap box 
derby to be held in the spring. That soap box derby 
grew into the "Tech Fair," consisting of a ferris 
wheel, a merry-go-round, some game booths, a
parade from downtown, and the buggy race.
The forerunners of the modem buggies were 
nothing like the sleek designs we're used to seeing 
now. In the original race, the driver and pusher took 
a pit stop where they changed left and right wheels 
on the four-wheeled vehicle and switched places.
By the late '20s, the buggies were modeled to 
resemble contemporary race cars, and in the early 
'30s, Beta Theta Pi constructed a buggy constructed 
with a wooden frame and covered with airplane 
silk. By then, the course had been changed to a 
course more similar to the current one. The buggy 
was lighter than previous models, but wasn't 
designed to be aerodynamic; it wasn't until 1937 that 
three-wheeled buggies were designed.
The exact date that buggy became a part of 
Spring Carnival is difficult to pin down  early 
Thistles are vague on this point  but the 1934 
Thistle mentions Sweepstakes finals as an integral 
part of Spring Carnival. They were held late Sunday 
afternoon.
World War II was the only period since the 
origin of the races in which the races didn't take 
place, but after the war, the current technological 
emphasis on buggy design took off. Noteworthy 
firsts in buggy construction are Pi Kappa Alpha's 
steel-framed, fiberglass-shell buggy; Phi Kappa 
Theta's buggy in 1949, which was the first to have a 
unibody construction; and more recently, Delta
Upsilon's two-wheel buggy, introduced in 1985 but 
declared unsafe by last year's Sweepstakes Commit
tee.
Buggy has been the most constant activity in the 
history of Spring Carnival, with Booth, which 
started in the early twenties, coming in at a close 
second. Other activities were popular over the 
decades, but just didn't make it. The Mardi Gras 
dance, for instance, was really big in the thirties. In 
1938 it cost couples $5.25 for a ticket that admitted 
them to all the events over the weekend, including 
the Mardi Gras costume ball which featured Tommy 
Dorsey that year.
Events such as splashing canoe tilting contests, 
tumbling roller derbies, Vaudeville shows, Spring 
Carnival Queen coronations, and plank-jousting 
competitions have come and gone through the years. 
At one point, organizations designed floats which 
were judged according to originality. Entrants had 
to be careful, though, because anything deemed in
appropriate would be censored.
The spirit has remained the same, however, and 
although we've lost a lot of traditions along the way, 
they've been replaced with new ones  like shows 
at Scotland Yard and the laser show. Who knows 
how long they could last?

Kappa Sigma brother takes a trip to the moon and back
On January 31,1971, the Apollo 
14 mission took off on its trip to the 
moon. The spacecraft, Kitty Hawk, was 
special to Carnegie Mellon  on board 
was Edgar D. Mitchell, a 1952 graduate 
of CMU and a Kappa Sigma brother. 
Mitchell took two things with him 
which now are housed on campus: a 
miniature version of the school's banner 
and the Star and Crescent, the Kappa 
Sig brother pin.
Mitchell was the lunar module 
pilot for the Kitty Hawk; his mission 
lasted until February 9. That May, he 
attended CMU's commencement 
ceremonies to receive an honorary 
doctorate degree. During commence
ment, Mitchell presented the school
with the CMU flag he had taken to the 
moon with him.
Later that day, a reception was 
held in Mitchell's honor by CMU's 
Alumni Association and by Delta Alpha, 
the Kappa Sigma chapter. It was here 
that Mitchell presented his fraternity 
chapter with the pin he took to the 
moon. It had been specially made for 
him before his trip.
Today the pin is mounted in the 
Kappa Sig house. The flag is on display 
in Alumni Relations.
Mitchell was later recognized as the 
Kappa Sigma Man of the Year for 1971.

The culture of the Middle Ages is here, now
"Oyez," yells the herald. Suddenly people in strange 
garb gather around in a circle. "Oyez" is the announcement 
command for an unusual organization called the Society for 
Creative Anachronism.
SCA is a nationwide, non-profit organization started in
1966 in Berkeley, California, when a group of 
students staged medieval tournaments and feasts in 
their backyard. Since then, SCA has been focusing its 
activities on medieval studies through re-creation of 
skills and pastimes.
Because of the appeal of SCA's activities, the 
organization has grown to over two hundred chap
ters in United States and Canada, divided into nine 
kingdoms. The CMU chapter, located in the East 
Kingdom, is called the College of Cawdor. It belongs 
to "The Barony Marche of the Debatable Land," 
which includes most of Western Pennsylvania.
The CMU chapter meets regularly with two 
other chapters around the Pittsburgh area on the 
second Wednesday of each month in Porter 225 or 
Skibo. Together, they study medieval crafts, culinary 
skills, dances, and games.
SCA members are required to wear period 
clothes from the Middle Ages. They eat with 
wooden or metal utensils to simulate the period as 
much as possible.
Most importantly, SCA sponsors tournaments 
for fighters to defend chivalry, honor, and glory and 
to earn their titles. The fighters can only use wooden
weaponry, but these weapons include bows, 
arrows, shields, swords, spears, and pole arms. 
Tournaments take place on the Cut Sundays at noon 
and Wednesdays at 6pm.
SCA also sponsor tournaments of a larger scale. 
For example, the wood quest involves an elaborate 
search for a lost maiden and treasures.
However, the biggest event is the annual Pennic 
War in Butler County between the East Kingdom 
and the Middle Kingdom. The three-day event is a 
serious challenge to most fighters to earn higher 
nobility. The hype of the event goes as far as pub
lishing an pamphlet to predict the odds for all the 
fighters.
The War is usually followed by a feast serving 
period cuisine such asrillettes (a pat made from 
duck meat,) pickle beef, and game pottage pie.
So if you're interested in the Middle Ages, give 
SCA a try. Contact your baronial Seneschal. Her 
name is Lady Adrianna Ramstar at 421-9539. She 
will lend you a garb for your first event. Good luck 
on your quest!

Greeks play a strong role in the music department
Unbeknownst to many Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, the college of Fine Arts houses two Greek or
ganizations based on brotherhood in music: Phi Mu 
Alpha and Sigma Alpha Iota.
The honorary men's fraternity, Phi Mu Alpha, 
was founded in 1898 with membership based on 
academic achievement and musicianship. Brother
hood extends beyond college, providing an interna
tional network to help musicians find work. The 
Alpha Omega chapter at Carnegie Mellon offers 
tutoring for music students, as well as ushering at 
concerts and help at music department auditions.
Students in Phi Mu Alpha participate in the 
Philharmonic Orchestra, Choir, Wind Ensemble, 
Jazz Ensemble, contemporary Ensemble, and 
various chamber ensembles. Phi Mu alumni can be 
found in orchestras all over the United States and 
around the world. Some of the most active freelance musicians in the Pittsburgh area are brothers 
performing with the River City Brass Band, the 
Balcony Big Band, and the Glenn Miller Orchestra 
and substituting in the Pittsburgh Symphony. Some 
distinguished faculty among the brotherhood 
include Robert Page, Jon Mitchell, Randy Purcell, 
Keith Lockhart, and Rob Rocco.
Sigma Alpha Iota is an international music 
fraternity for women. It was originated in 1903 at the 
University of Michigan; the Alpha Mu chapter at 
Carnegie Mellon has been in existence since 1930. 
One third of the women in the music department are 
currently sisters.
SAI has also participated in tutoring within the 
department. Other activities include an excellence 
competition to help CMU musicians with some of 
their academic expenses. SAI sisters participated in 
Greek Sing two years ago and again this year for the
4 \kr-neg'-e\
charity Big Brothers/Big Sisters. Two years ago the 
Iotians, composed mostly of voice majors, offered 
singing telegrams for Valentine's Day.
Some of the faculty who are members of SAI 
include Department Head Marilyn Thomas, Beatrice 
Krebs, Natalie Ozeas, Nancy Galbraith, Anabell 
Joseph, Colette Wilkins, and Helen Gossard.
Both Phi Mu and SAI underwent significant 
growth and revitalization over the past two years; 
members and faculty agree that they are now 
viewed as leaders in the music department. A few 
years ago, the two fraternities were in constant 
competition, but recently they have learned to work 
with one another to further the musical and social 
growth of the department.

Unmasking Studio theater
Everyone hears about the productions that the 
CMU Drama Department puts on every semester. 
The shows sell out quickly because many students 
on campus enjoy theater and would probably like to 
see more plays.
They can. One of the best kept secrets of CMU is 
Studio Theater. Where is it? What is it? Who does it?
Studio Theater is located directly behind CFA in 
a small building near the trailer offices and across 
from GSIA. It's a place for acting, directing, and 
theater production majors to gain experience in 
working in a theater and before an audience. The 
productions students put on range from Greek 
tragedies to modern comedies to student written 
plays.
The reason not many people know about Studio 
Theater is that, often, its productions are not adver
tised outside of CFA. Usually, the best way to find 
out if something is playing is by word of mouth. 
However, there are several posters up now, an
nouncing the Junior Repertory's season.
While everyone can attend most of the produc
tions in Studio Theater, you must keep something in 
mind if you can't get into a production or if the 
management asks all non-dramats to leave. It is a 
first-come, first-serve basis for students majoring in 
the theater arts, who must often see the plays as a 
class requirement.
Studio Theater is not only an opportunity to 
enjoy the plays, but also a chance for the rest of the 
university to see the up-and-coming talents of the 
theatrical community free.

Every cast and crew that works on a production in the Kresge Theatre traditionally signs the 
back ivall Except for freshmen, that is. According to a superstition known as the Freshman 
Curse, drama majors who sign the wall in their freshman year ivill be cut by the department 
before they graduate. According to rumor, the 1980 alumna Holly Hunter is the only dramat to 
have successfully challenged the curse; several members of the class of '92 are ttying to 
repeat her feat.

Fraternities outside of the quad party on
SAE has Dante's Inferno, Pika has its Firetruck, 
Theta Xi has its Basket Bucks, and Iota Eta Pi has 
Mount Olympus.
Wait a second  you've heard of SAE, Pika, and 
Theta Xi, but what is this Iota Eta Pi?
Iota Eta Pi is one of at least three Greek organi
zations on campus that are not officially recognized 
in almost everything. Sigma Lambda Gamma, Pi 
Alpha Delta, and Iota Eta Pi were all formed by a 
group of guys that simply wanted to band together 
in one way or another.
"Everything was going pretty good, people were 
getting to know each other and they were becoming 
good friends. So we formed a group and we chose 
Greek letters," says freshman Kevin Pogany, one of 
the two founders of Sigma Lambda Gamma, a 
pseudo-fraternity fashioned out of a floor in Hammerschlag. The freshmen in Schlag 3A organized 
into SLG and now participate in such activities as 
barbequeing, painting the Fence, IM sports, and of 
course, parties.
"We don't party every weekend, we party 
maybe twice a semester. The concentration is on 
school, not trying to find a girl or drinking beer," 
Pogany says.
As far as imitating the real fraternities goes, SLG 
"is not a mockery of the Greek system, we just 
thought we would have some fun," says Pogany.
"The fraternity did seriously consider doing 
buggy," says Pogany. "We would have a guy 
sitting in a box on wheels throwing candy out 
during carnival," he laughs. "There'd also be a boom 
box." In any case, the brothers decided not to do 
buggy because of the $300 entrance fee and the fines 
imposed if any freerolls are missed.
The 30-member fraternity will be splitting into 
different factions next year, but they will try to stick 
together. "Eight people are going to one place, while 
another eight are going to another. Next year, we 
also hope to have a bulletin board [on Andrew] 
available for all of the members." Pogany says. He 
adds that one SLG brother might remain in Schlag 
3A to recruit new members of next year's freshman 
class. "Talk to the guys, try to start a tradition or 
something," he says. "I've no problem getting 
freshman next year. We wouldn't go elsewhere; 
there's something about Schlag 3A."
In addition to its private events, SLG also co
sponsors events with SDC. Their first event was a 
paper airplane contest held several weeks ago in the 
gym. Presently, SDC and SLG are planning on co
sponsoring Hillfest '90, although no date is set yet.
Iota Eta Pi was created in late 1987. Five guys 
living in Marybelle always partied together and 
decided to name themselves something. Last 
semester, they had a resurgence of interest and now 
there are about 13 non-brothers and a non-little 
sister. According to junior Ed Miller, a non-brother, 
"we consider ourselves a non-fraternity because a 
fraternity costs money."
Mount Olympus is a loft which one of the non
brothers created for use at parties. At the last Iota 
Eta Pi party, there were fourteen people on the fourfoot square platform, which stands about six feet off 
the ground.
Iota Eta Pi also has a non-pledge phase that all 
the brothers go through. 'The non-pledge phase 
doesn't last long - maybe two minutes," says Miller.
"Usually, the person has to go to one of our parties 
and we have the baptismal rites. Somebody with 
some kind of official power in our non-fraternity 
baptizes the person in the name of beer." Miller 
usually performs the ritual.
As far as getting new members goes, the non
brothers bring their friends and if they attend a few 
parties, they're just nicknamed and baptized, and 
they become non-brothers. "Everybody has to have 
a nickname and you have to be drunk to be nick
named," says Miller.
Miller also stated that the real Greeks are "all 
right, lots of free beer." One of the founding mem
bers, Peter Low, is actually a KDR brother. Miller 
stated that the reason that the non-fraternity does 
not consider buggy or booth is that "we lack motiva
tion and it interrupts our drinking time." Also, he 
mentions that since Iota Eta Pi does not collect dues, 
it has no real source of funds.
The non-fraternity doesn't plan too far into the 
future. "We don't even have plans for next week," 
laughs Miller.
Last but not least is Pi Alpha Delta, Paul and 
Dave's fraternity. According to Stan Musial, a PAD 
brother, PAD is "a two and a half year old, local, 
unchartered, non-recognized, yet completely and 
unquestionably legitimate fraternity."
"When we were freshmen, fraternities weren't 
that cool. We made money by charging for parties. 
Our parties were getting bigger and bigger until we 
got busted for selling alcohol 
to minors and having half
kegs in our room. The 
weekend before the bust was 
pledge night and anyone 
who came in was a brother," 
said Dave Liebel, one of 
PAD's founders.
"We have about 20 
brothers who are students at 
CMU on and off campus and 
about 70 in all. Any broad 
that comes in the room is a 
little sister. They're not 
called little sisters, they're 
called PAD broads," says 
junior Paul Lorence, the 
other PAD founder. About 
seven or eight brothers knew 
each other before coming to 
CMU.
PAD's initiation proce
dure is pretty simple. When a 
person comes to a PAD 
party, the brothers decide if 
he or she is cool. After 
passing this test, the potential 
PAD brother is told the four 
rules; if he or she can recite 
them, he or she is shown the 
secret handshake and be
comes a PAD brother.
Several brothers have 
boxer shorts with their letters 
given to them by some of 
their little sisters.
PAD started out just 
having parties, but last year,
the members started playing IM sports and they 
were actually pretty good. In 1988, they were 
volleyball and three-man basketball champions. In 
1989, they won men's and women's football and 
three-man volleyball championships.
In addition to their parties where people "drink 
beer and act stupid," PAD also has an annual semiformal Christmas party. Lorence describes the semiformal as "good booze, kind of serious and kind of 
sentimental with the toastings."
Lorence and Liebel believe that their fraternity is 
more of a brotherhood than the real Greeks. "In 
some houses, they're brothers who say 'I hate that 
guy.' We don't do that kind of thing," says Lorence.
However, some PAD members have gone on to 
the real fraternities. Junior Ray Fratto is now a 
brother at Beta Theta Pi, and Liebel has pledged DU.
In addition, they would also like to enter Greek 
Sing. "We have a lot of talented people. Dave is 
doing about 30 percent of the choreography for DU's 
Greek Sing," says Lorence. He says the PAD buggy, 
if they ever got one, would be a shopping cart.
Unfortunately, PAD will probably die out next 
year because most of the members will have gradu
ated.

Mellon Institutes magnet attracts scientists
What is it that brings some of the greatest minds in the 
academic world to Carnegie Mellon?
Different departments adopt varying techniques to re
cruit, but for the past twelve years the Biology Department
has been able to attract molecular biologists to the 
first floor of Mellon Institute using the magnet on 
the highest field nuclear magnetic resonance spec
trophotometer in the world.
No, the department hasn't gone to the extreme 
of kidnapping scientists through their keys and 
change in their pockets. But the opportunity to use 
the most powerful machine of its type in order to 
study the structure of biological molecules brings 
scientists to CMU where they work in the NMR 
Facility for Biomedical Studies. Even those biologists 
who can not make the trip themselves send samples 
here for measurements at the facility.
According to professor Joe Dadok, the system 
has been operating at 620 megahertz since 1978. The 
magnetic field of the spectrophotometer has a 
strength of 146,000 Gauss. By comparison, the 
earth's magnetic field is meager, being about one 
half a Gauss.
Dadok explained that the higher the strength of 
the magnetic field, the more information is given in 
the resulting NMR spectrum. More information 
allows the scientists to study more complex mole
cules. "It's like increasing the resolution of a tele
scope," said Dadok.
The NMR Facility has conducted projects with 
various organization over the years including a 
blood research study with Allegheny General 
Hospital. Other researchers send samples to facility 
which are tested for a fee. Groups even send their 
own researchers to conduct the tests here at CMU.
CMU's spectrophotometer remained the domi
nant machine in the field for 10 years. Then, com
mercial NMR spectrophotometer began to reach the 
600 MHz mark around 1988. Dadok explained that 
CMU's machine gained the ten-year advantage by 
utilizing a non-persistent superconducting magnet 
which must be energized using 160 amps of current. 
Other systems, even those approaching CMU's in 
strength, employ persistent magnets which need not 
be energized.
Even though the system is still the most power
ful in the world, the NMR Facility is expecting to 
upgrade the system to 900 MHz in the near future. 
Dadok said he could not be specific about length of 
time required for the upgrade because crucial tests 
must still be made.
Three factors determined the target frequency of 
900 MHz. These are problems, according to Dadok, 
which must be considered whenever the strength of 
an NMR spectrophotometer is increased. These are: 
finding a superconductor capable of carrying the 
current for the high magnetic field, making the 
magnet capable of withstanding the tremendous 
forces to which it will be subjected, and making the 
field constant and stable.
Dadok is excited about the project. He said, "If 
you go from 600[MHz] to 900, that is a dramatic 
step."
Did you know?

from the Prop Shop in the 
basement of CFA is made 
out of wood. The drama 
department needed the real 
one for a play and replaced 
it with the wooden one they 
had been using as a prop. 
When the show ended they 
never switched them back.

Video editing cluster is a new addition to CFA
The College of Fine Arts has re
ceived a new addition in the last two weeks: 
a video editing cluster on the third floor. It is 
essentially like a computer cluster except it 
is equipped to edit half inch VHS tape.
There are two editing bays, which are 
complete set ups with all of the equipment 
needed for editing. In addition, each bay has 
a video mixer/special effects generator that 
allows one to fade, wipe, or key to a color, 
and each also sports various digital effects.
The cluster is sponsored by the Instructional 
Technology Center. Liz Malcolm, the 
manager of the cluster, says she hopes to 
have two additional bays by the end of 
spring.
The cluster is open for use by stu
dents, faculty, and staff of CMU. The only 
requirement is some knowledge of how to 
work the equipment. So far it has been 
pretty quiet but Malcolm expects that will 
change once students start realizing that the 
cluster is there. If you don't know how to 
use the equipment and need or want to 
learn, two people at a time can sign up for 
the workshop every Thursday night.
Malcolm says it takes about two hours to 
run through how to use the equipment. The 
cluster employs about eight work study 
positions so someone is almost always there 
to answer questions. It is open from noon to 
midnight. If you want more information the 
phone number is x6751.

You havent seen these Hunt Libraries
Imagine a room decorated with deep brown 
wood and handwoven French rugs. Fine, rare books 
line the walls, and sparsely placed in the middle of 
the room are soft, inviting places to sit and read. 
Now imagine a smaller room, similarly decorated 
and lined with cases of rare books.
It may be difficult to believe that something like 
this is in the same building you've probably visited 
more than a thousand times.
Hunt Library was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Roy 
A. Hunt in 1960; both the Fine and Rare Book Room 
of Special Collections, on the fourth floor, and the 
Hunt Institute Botanical Library, on the fifth floor, 
have inherited a wealth of extraordinary books from 
Mrs. Hunt, an avid book collector and connoisseur. 
Most students don't know about the books and 
artwork that the Hunt family donated to the early 
Hunt Library, but they've since grown into two very 
interesting collections.
The fifth floor of the library is the Hunt Institute 
for Botanical Documentation, and the library there is 
breathtaking  if not because of the decor, then 
because it houses around 72,000 books, most on the 
subject of botany. Although the original library 
contained books on horticulture and botany, the 
collection of botanical books grew much more 
quickly than the other two. The Institute for Botani
cal Documentation may seem like just another floor 
of the library, but Charlotte Tancin, a librarian for 
the Institute, describes its reputation in other parts 
of the U.S. and abroad as " well-established."
Why, then, does the institute seem like such a 
secret? "There isn't a lot of traffic, but lots of usage," 
says Tancin. If the Institute seems removed in some 
ways from the rest of the University Libraries, that's 
because it is a separate entity; Tancin described it as 
more like a "research division." The Institute's 
library and the University Libraries do collaborate 
often, but the Institute's library is just beginning to 
have some of its holdings included on-line with the 
other University Libraries.
The library gets most of its use from people who 
call the institute requesting information or materials. 
As far as visitors go, they generally vary from 
serious researchers, who come from a distance to 
use the library, to architecture and art students, who 
need landscaping information or want to examine 
some of the botanical illustrations.
Of course, there are certain fundamental differ
ences between the Institute's library and the Univer
sity Libraries; the most important one is that some of 
the books in the Institute's library are so rare and old 
that it wouldn't be safe or practical to allow visitors 
free reign over the collections. The valuable rare 
books aren't separated from the others. Because of 
the delicate nature of the collection, a librarian is 
always in the room with a user and brings in the 
books as the user requests them. The catch is that 
there are only two librarians on duty at any given 
time  hence the afternoon hours, from 1 pm to 5 
pm. In addition, the environment in the library is 
carefully controlled to protect the books. "We try to 
keep the temperature under 68 degrees, between 65 
and 70," says Tancin, "and we try to keep the 
humidity between 40 and 45 percent."
Like the Institute's library, the Special Collec
tions' holdings began as a gift from the Hunt family. 
Over time, the collection grew with faculty contribu
tions of small collections and other acquisitions. The 
Fine and Rare Book Room on the fourth floor of 
Hunt Library is a part of the Special Collections 
division. Comprised of about 10,000 rare books, the 
collection was described by Mary Catherine 
Johnsen, who is in charge of the Fine and Rare Book 
Room, as a "small, hard-working collection." 
Although the subject matter varies more in this 
collection than in the Hunt Institute's library, there's 
still a focus. "We're very strong in graphic design, 
typography, fine bindings, first editions, and 18th 
and 19th-century English and American literature," 
says Evangela Levis, an assistant to Johnsen.
The Fine and Rare Book Room is a museum of
sorts, a testament to the "continuity of ideas," as 
Johnsen puts it. The Fine and Rare Book Room 
contains exquisitely made books and examples of 
artwork. As in the Institute's library, the environ
ment in the Fine and Rare Book Room is carefully 
monitored to preserve the books; the requirements 
for temperature and humidity are the same for both 
libraries. Johnsen and Levis also preserve the books 
by boxing and rebinding them.
Among the Special Collections holdings in the 
Fine and Rare Book Room are a leaf from a Guten
berg bible (even more rare in that it has an error); 
rare editions of works by Copernicus, Euclid, and 
Einstein (these are part of the Posner Collection, on 
indefinite loan to the University); a travel log kept 
by Capt. William Bligh on the open boat which he 
and a group of men returned from the famous 
mutiny (another part of the Posner collection); and a 
first edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
These libraries have the problem of balancing 
the use of the books with the difficult task of pre
serving them for future generations. Johnsen 
describes the purpose of the Fine and Rare Book 
Room as a commitment to "to keep the artifact as 
long as possible and share it with as many as 
possible." Librarians from both libraries express a 
desire for the library to be used as an active part of 
the learning process in a broad sense. "They don't 
do any good just sitting on a shelf," says Tancin.
"It's a goal of mine for this to be more heavily used
 a lot of people just don't know that we have it."
The library at the Hunt Institute for Botanical 
Documentation is open to anyone. The librarians 
suggest calling x2434 and making an appointment to 
come, so you can be sure that someone will be able 
to help you. The Fine and Rare Book Room is open 
Monday through Friday, 1:30 to 4:30 pm, Tuesday 
evenings 7 to 10 pm, or by appointment.

Leaping into Architecture
The stairway in Wean Hall, univer
sally known as Architect's Leap, seems 
an unlikely candidate for adoption by 
the Architecture Department.
Perhaps it is suitable after all, due to 
its absurdity. Although it rises from the
third floor to the eighth floor, it is 
most commonly entered on the 
fifth floor. It is hellishly de
signed; the thin metal railings 
provide no concealment of the 
steep five-story descent, and those 
of us with a horror of heights 
cannot even seek the refuge of 
clinging to the opposite wall. The 
gap between the stairs and the 
adjacent wall is enough to terrify.
The only comfort one can 
derive from the precipitous ascent 
is the amusement of reading the 
graffiti written down the sides of 
each stairwell. At various times, 
attempts are made to remove 
parts of the verse, which soon 
reappears in its full version: 
"WHEN YOU'RE FEELING LIKE 
A JERK,
'CAUSE YOUR DESIGN JUST 
WON'T WORK,
GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE 
LEAP
THEN YOU'LL FINALLY GET 
SOME SLEEP."
The waggish doggerel refers, 
of course, to the tortures endured 
by members of the Architecture 
Department, who bear the full 
strain of a program ranked second
in the nation according to the Ad
mission's Office.
Not everyone finds the leap 
amusing, however. The body that 
is outlined on the ground floor is 
frequently erased. But somehow it 
always winds up redrawn rather 
quickly.
Even though the body is 
drawn to resemble an outline 
done by the police at the scene of 
a murder, official campus docu
ments assure us no one has ever 
actually jumped. However, inani
mate objects are often dropped.
As rumor has it, among the more 
notable objects are french fries 
dipped in liquid nitrogen and a 
cement block heavy enough to 
leave a substantial chip in the 
bottom.
To that venerable list should 
be added my Economics book, 
which sailed successfully down
ward before coming to a sudden 
and ignominous halt on the fourth 
floor, one story short of true glory. 
Page 71 bears indelible skid marks 
from its heroically futile endeavor.

Some serious star-gazing is hidden on Scaife
On every dear Sunday night at 8 pm, there is a 
small group of students quietly engaged in observ
ing Jupiter, Orion, the moon, and the stars from the 
observatory located at the top of Scaife Hall. They 
are the twenty odd members of Carnegie Mellon's 
Astronomy Club, and contrary to popular belief, 
they're not all physics majors.
The members of the club meet on a regular basis 
every Sunday, and also go out on Saturday morn
ings to look at the sun through a solar filter. Some
times, they meet for special events, last semester 
they held an open house in their observatory for the 
total lunar eclipse. The purpose of the club, accord
ing to Erol Caglarcan, the president, is to teach its 
members what to look for in the sky and how to find 
it.
The observatory, completed in 1986, is dedicated 
to Dr. Truman Kohlman, the faculty advisor for the 
club and the professor of the astronomy course 
taught here. It took five years to raise the money 
needed to construct the structure and complete the 
mirrors hand-ground by former students in the 
telescope. The ten inch Newtonian reflector tele
scope, which can spot Jupiter's moons, sits on a 
platform which is accessed by rolling away part of 
the roof; the entire observatory was designed by 
students.
The Astronomy Club wants to replace the 
rotating controls of the telescope in the observatory 
with an automated joystick controller, but difficul
ties in budget and technology have slowed down the 
project.
One of the problems that the Astronomy Club 
constantly encounters is the weather. Very clear 
skies are required for optimal viewing, something 
that doesn't occur often in Pittsburgh. The city's 
lights also create a haze which makes observation 
difficult. Recently installed floodlights in the Scaife 
Hall parking lot have worsened the situation, and 
members are trying to get the lights directed away
from the observatory.
In order to avoid the problem of "light pollu
tion," the club takes occasional out-of-town observ
ing trips to a private farm in Green County and 
McConnell's Mill in Butler County. On these trips, 
the members carry portable reflecting telescopes and 
one larger stationary telescope. The stationarytelescope requires large batteries to keep it rotating 
with the Earth so the field of view remains constant, 
and it also has settings with star coordinates so 
stellar objects can be located easily. Red flashlights 
provide illumination in the field, since once an 
observer's eyes become night adjusted they can be 
harmed by bright lights.
An out-of-town trip is planned for the first week 
in April, when the comet Austin will make its first 
appearance. Austin will be the brightest comet in 
years, sixteen times as bright as Hailey's Comet. It 
will be visible to the naked eye, perhaps even in 
Pittsburgh, as long as the skies are clear.
Other upcoming excursions include a visit to the 
Allegheny Observatory, a professional astronomical 
facility, and the Amateur Astronomy Association of 
Pittsburgh. The club will also accompany the 
astronomy class on its visit to the Buhl Planetarium.
One fun tradition of the club is to paint the fence 
the Thursday before Spring Carnival. The Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette noticed the club's fence last year.
Painted black with stars, it featured Carl Sagan's 
quotation, "If you want to bake an apple pie from 
scratch, you must first invent the Universe."
Interested students can attend club meetings, 
held every Sunday at 8 pm in Doherty Hall 2304. 
Even on cloudy days, meetings are held and future 
observations are discussed. Dues are $5 for a semes
ter. New members are welcome. If you have any 
questions, call Erol Caglarcan at x4590.

Multi-media classrooms are
Recent renovations on the third floor of Baker 
Hall have not only given it a face-lift, but also a tech
nological leap into the twenty-first century. Located 
in room 355 is the first multi-media classroom at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Multi-media is at the cutting edge of technology 
to present interactive texts and audio-visual images. 
Professors like H&SS Dean Stephen Fienberg work 
with Macintosh HyperCard stacks and MacroMaker 
to program their lecture notes and audio presenta
tions into sequences that they can access through 
remote control. Fienberg started his experimenting 
in two of his classes: 36-209, Probability and Statis
tics, and 79-105, American Census.
In his statistics class, Fienberg uses the Macin
tosh environment to create graphs and charts to 
demonstrate how to solve problem sets.
In American Census, Fienberg says he experi
ments a little further for every lecture. During the 
first class, his students saw a class outline created 
with HyperCard. The third lecture had the students 
looking at color maps and graphs on the color 
monitor. Fienberg says he hopes to present taped 
commercials of the census alongside his lecture 
notes in the next few weeks; he will be able to 
control the presentation with only the click of a 
button.
However, Fienberg says that most of MultiMedia presentation is still experimental. "I'm acting 
as a naive faculty member, attempting to realize the 
potential of the new technology," he says. "Neither I
new to faculty and students
nor any other faculty member can learn this over
night."
Some of the problems faced by faculty members 
who are experimenting with multi-media involve 
the incompatibility between IBM PC and Macintosh 
programs. According to H&SS Director of Comput
ing Tracey Futhey, the college is going through a 
transition period from an IBM PC to a Macintosh en
vironment. Therefore, many of its previous develop
ments on the PC are suffering from a slow 
conversion. For example, an award-winning interac
tive video on ethics by Philosophy's Preston Covey, 
The Right to Die, is currently released for the IBM PC 
and compatible machines only. The Macintosh 
version is still under development.
Fienberg feels that the new facility should 
encourage the faculty to experiment and engage in 
the development of interactive educational pro
grams. The progression of programs has already 
taken off in H&SS. The Modern Language depart
ment is working on an interactive disk for Japanese, 
and the History Department also has projects 
underway.
The future of multi-media seems bright. Fien
berg projects the installation of a satellite link down 
to Baker 355 which will enable the facility to support 
the reception of foreign broadcasts.

Research Opportunities: where to start, where to look, what to do
Undergraduate students have a lot of opportuni
ties for learning outside of simply reading books and 
attending classes. On a campus with 58 different 
research centers, there is a whole range of creative 
projects, special research-oriented classes, and inde
pendent study opportunities available that most 
undergrads don't know about.
Every department at Carnegie Mellon has 
something to offer undergraduates. In addition, each 
faculty member has a field of expertise that might be 
of interest to a student looking to get involoved with 
a project. So where does an undergrad start looking?
The best place would be the Directory of Oppor
tunities for Undergraduate Research and Creative 
Projects. The directory covers every department in 
every undergraduate and graduate college, as well 
as each research center and institute. It gives the 
major thrust of the research in that department and 
then breaks down what is available into specific 
opportunities.
For each department and research center, the di
rectory lists special classes that are particularly ori
ented towards developing research techniques or 
promoting independent projects or study. Read the 
course descriptions carefully, though, because some 
of the classes specify a particular major, class year, 
grade point average, or previous experience as pre
requisites. However, others are quite flexible and
almost anyone can take them.
For students interested in strict research, CMU 
offers a wealth of opportunities. Faculty members in 
various departments have existing projects that 
interested students can help with. The directory lists 
detailed descriptions of current projects but is not 
necessarily a comprehensive collection of all that is 
availible. If a student is interested in a particular 
department, he or she is encouraged to call the 
contacts listed and ask about other research options 
that may not be printed.
If students want to start their own research 
projects rather than working on existing ones, they 
must first find faculty sponsors for their projects.
The directory lists every faculty member and his or 
her field of expertise and research. Not all faculty 
members are interested in or have time for under
graduate reasearchers, so there is an additional list 
of those who expressed a desire to work with under
graduates.
Once they have found a sponsor, students draw 
up proposals for their projects. Each proposal 
consists of the project's objective, signifigance, and 
design, the student's related background experience, 
how the project will be presented, and who will 
evaluate it. Students must submit this information to 
the Associate Provost for Academic Projects by the 
third Friday of October for Spring projects, or the
third Friday of March for Summer and Fall projects.
The University offers grants of up to $500, which 
is intended to cover a minimal amount of the 
expenses. Any undergrad who is participating in re
search or creative projects is eligible by simply 
specifying whether he or she wishes to conduct the 
project for academic credit, pay, or as a volunteer.
Some of the more active summer research 
programs are in the Biology Department, in all the 
research centers, and the H&SS minority""programs.
Any students interested in more information 
about undergraduate research and creative projects 
should contact either Barbara Lazarus, Associate 
Provost for Academic Projects, Joseph Devine, Asso
ciate Dean of H&SS, Robert Kail, Associate Dean of 
CIT/MCS, or Thomas Keating, Director of Student 
Employment. This committee produced the direc
tory.
Copies of the Directory of Opportunities for 
Undergraduate Research and Creative Projects are 
available in every academic department, all of the 
Dean's offices, all of the libraries, and Lazarus' 
office. Next year the directory will be on a Macin
tosh server.

Robotics Lab tour is a trip into the future
About a month into my freshman year, a friend 
and I spent several hours wandering all over 
Doherty and Wean Halls trying to find out two 
things: a way to the roof and a robotics laboratory.
We climbed countless flights of stairs and 
peered into a lot of dark rooms, but we didn't find 
the robotics lab that night. Nor did we find an 
unalarmed door leading to a rooftop.
There is a better method to find robotics labs 
although it doesn't possess the mystery and ro
mance of Wean and Doherty by night: an official lab 
tour sponsored by the Robotics Institute. These tours 
begin at 9 am in room 4605 Wean Hall. Laboratories 
give full demonstrations at 11:15 and 11:45.
Thirteen dedicated laboratories and four 
porgramcenters are situated on several different 
floors in Wean, Hammerschlag, and Doherty halls 
and on Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park.
The research activities are conducted in the 
Intelligent Sensors Laboratory, the Flexible Manu
facturing Laboratory, the Manipulation Laboratory, 
the Robotics Welding Laboratory, the Inspection 
Laboratory, the Calibrated Imaging Laboratory, the 
Advanced Manipulators Laboratory, and the HandEye Laboratory.
The research in these labs focuses on automation 
and computer aided manufacturing, robotics for . 
hazardous environments, autonomous mobile 
robots, and human services. Researchers and stu
dents who work at the Institute actually teach robots 
how to think for themselves  at least in a limited 
sense. They are inventing technology which makes a 
robot perceive and analyze an unfamiliar environ
ment and negotiate the terrain. The machines not 
only think, but they also learn from their mistakes.
Four program centers are affiliated with the Ro
botics Institute. The Field Robotics Center researches 
and creates machines which work in unfamiliar and 
hazardous environments, like around nuclear 
accidents or in mining or deep sea areas. The FRC is 
responsible for the Ambler Project, a six-legged 
robot capable of navigating rugged terrain.
The NavLab is also a product of the FRC. The 
NavLab is a fully self-contained mobile research and 
testing lab, housed in a two-engine truck. The Lab

can take commands from a computer or a human. 
The only drawback to this milestone in robotic 
technology is that the NavLab consumes more gaso
line than two old Lincolns.
The Manufacturing, Engineering, and Technol
ogy Application Center acts as a middleman be
tween the large-scale research capabilities of the 
Robotics Institute and small, upwardly mobile 
industries. The Vision and Autonomous Systems 
Center develops new robotics technology for 
integrated systems, like the Mars Rover, a robot 
which posses the capability to "see" the land around 
it, move, and take samples.
The Robotics Institute also has established the 
first and only existing PhD program in robotics in 
the nation. The curriculum was created between the
Institute, the School of Computer Science, CIT, and 
GSIA. The course of study includes a significant 
amount of participation in laboratory research.
Make no mistake, the Robotics Institute is not 
about fancy toys for big children. The purpose of the 
Institute is business. Since its inception in 1979, the 
RI's annual research funding has gone from $1 
million to $12 million. The technology that is envi
sioned, designed, and built there is created to im
prove U.S. productivity and competitiveness. The 
CMU Robotics Institute is not only creating the 
future, it is taking an active role in how the United 
States is going to get there.
