Smoking resolution passes

Last week Student Senate passed an amended form of the recently proposed smoking resolution. In the hope of being fair to non-smokers and smokers alike, the revised proposal now contains three main points. The first section bans smoking from student organization offices. The second section permits smoking at indoor activities sponsored by the student organizations that receive funding from the Student Activities Fee, but only if everyone consents, and only if the smoke will not affect any designated smoke free locations. The last section recommends that Campus Police be required to fine all smoking policy violators a minimum of $10.; The differences between this amended resolution and the original resolution, proposed by H&SS Senator Josh Knauer on September 8, are subtle. The first version of the bill prohibited smoking from indoor student organizations, without exception. The bill also recommended that Campus Police be empowered to levy a $50 fine against all violators of the smoking policy. More controversially, the resolution also originally recommended that the University ban smoking in all campus buildings, including academic buildings, dining areas, and all other indoor areas that are used by students. This last recommendation was dropped entirely from the amended resolution before it was passed.Paragraph three of CMUs official Policy on Smoking reads: Any enclosed workarea (i.e. work area with floor to ceiling walls) occupied by more than one person may be designated as a smok
ing area by the occupants only if such an area is occupied exclusively by smokers and provided that it is feasible to do so without affecting other smoke-free locations in the immediate area or in connected areas.Before the new resolution by Senate, smoking had been tolerated in student office space and meeting space under paragraph three of CMUs smoking policy, if all of the students sharing the space at that particular time agreed. The Senate resolution now prohibits any and all smoking in such spaces.Senator Erik Altmann (SCS), who authored the amendments, said ofthe resolution, One ofthe specific problems that this was meant to address was that we had guys lighting up, like in the Senate office when no one was around, which they were entitled to do then, but when someone else comes in an hour later, you have all this smoke hanging around and its ugly. Applications of the second part of the resolution, prohibiting smoking from indoor events sponsored by Senate-funded organizations unless everybody agrees to permit smoke, has a few gray areas. For instance, if a club decides to rent Panther Hollow Inn for a night, then there could conceivably be no smoking permitted in the bar. In another case, a student organization may have a band come to play music at Scotland Yard. If that organization receives any money from the Activities Fee, and not everyone agrees to permit smoking, then it is automatically a nonsmoking event. Not only do the members of the club or organization have to unanimously permit smoking at their event, but that is also true for any guest that

might show up at the event.The recommendation to Campus Police requiring them to issue fines to those people who violate the smoking policy could do the most to protect the rights of non-smokers. Altmann said, Enforcement is the biggest problem on campus. The signs already posted around campus that promise a $50 fine are supposed to be enforced by the Pittsburgh Police and not Campus Police. His reasons for recommending that this power, accompanied by a lower fine, be given to Campus Police are to make enforcement more realistic and plausible.Altmann said, If the city of Pittsburgh wants to come in and issue $50 fees then thats fine, but theyre never going to, and so the question is how we can enforce this.Altmann opposed the first draft of the resolution because it set a $50 fine, rather than the $10 fine it now includes. The wording of the resolution has also been changed, from Campus Police being empowered to being required to issue fines. Altmann said Senate wanted to get it so that CMU police actually feel comfortable assigning fees to people, and also we wanted to keep the minimum fine fairly low and realistic. This recommendation may or may not be acted upon by Campus Polce. Michael Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, did tell Senate that he would give us a progress report on whatever they negotiate with the police about the situation, according to Altmann.The original statement banning smoking from all campus buildings was not included in the final draft of the resolution. However, the fight to make dining halls

Student Senate approved the Office of Student Affairs request for $3,000 in funding for this years International Festival by a vote of 9-1-8 in last Tuesdays meeting. Aliya Khan, coordinator of the International Festival, was denied the original request for $5,000 because Senates Funding & Recognition Committee voted to deny the request of $2,000 in printing costs, as the material printed for last years Asian Festival was ... wasted and just generally not wisely utilized, according to Senator Michael Tomblyn(MCS).Khan proposed the remaining $3,000 to help fund a speech given by the Secretary Gendecision of Senate.According to Murphy, the total cost of the International Festival is about $75,000, of which $50,000 is funded directly from President Robert Mehrabians budget. The balance is covered by organizations such as Student Senate, the Graduate Student Organization, Activities Board, Scotland Yard, Dining Service, and even the University of Pittsburgh. Khan said last year, the International Festival did not ... get as many student organizations [involved] because planning wasstarted in lateStudent Senate is supportive of the 
Latin American Festival... but this 
does not mean Senate should rob 
money from student groups to help 
the administration pay for [it].
r GSIA Senator Michael Loomis
eral of the Organization of the American States in addition to a concert.Last year, Student Senate had explicitly stated that it did not want Senate funding of the International Festival to be a trend. The return of this issue has angered some Senators. Senator Erik Altmann (SCS), who voted no in the funding vote, said the Student Activities Fee is an enabling fee, in which $3,000 could fund six new [student] groups ... These groups would not have any other place to go.Senator Michael Loomis (GSIA) said, Student Senate is supportive of the Latin American Festival and wishes to do what it can to make it a success, but this does not mean Student Senate should rob money from student groups to help the administration pay for [it]. Every student should understand that when Student Senate contributes a dollar towards an administrations activity, that is a dollar less for Senate to give to student groups. Michael Murphy, dean of Student Affairs, said his major concern was the Student Senates endorsement, and not necessarily funding. He affirms that not getting funding from Student Senate would be fine. He said Student Affairs will always go to student organizations like the Graduate Student Organization and the Activities Board for more co-sponsorship. Well always respect the
March. Organization and planning for this years festival started as far back as last October.Khan has made some important changes to tho festival since last year to got more studentsactive in multi-cultural awaronoss. Forty-seven countries will bo represented in this years Caribbean and Latin American Festival, ranging from Argentina to the Windward Islands. Also, a major change for the students benefit is loss lectures, more activities, such as dances and a pifiata- making contest. Most events will start at 4 pm instead of last years 11 am to make thoso activities more available to the Carnegie Mellon community.Throughout the International Festival, participants can attend personal journeys, which are defined as an informal talk given by a student, faculty, staff, or community member on an [international] topic of his/her choice. According to Khan, Students will get the opportunity to talk to somebody from other countries.Kelly Walter, a senior art major and student coordinator of the International Festival, has engendered more student interest by forming two committees. The decoration/publicity committee designs posters and signs and also gets the word out to the CMU community. The information committee consists of a representative from each of the 47 Caribbean and Latin American countries, who will participate in the Information Fair on October 22.

This semester, with the November 3 election just a few weeks away, Carnegie Mellon has been hard hit by the latest trend on campus  political and environmental activists trying to persuade students to just get involved.But is this just a passing fad?Not according to Denis Hayes, the founder of Earth Day. While speaking on campus last Tuesday, he advised his audience to join the growing numbers of students involved in politics if they are to have any hope of influencing the future of their country.In a talk organized by the Heinz School, Student Pugwash, and The Political Speakers Forum Board, the internationally recognized environmentalist stressed that most major environmental decisions made in your lifetime will be made in the next 1 Oyears. In order to influence these decisions, he said, students must become politically active.While he was at Harvard, Hayes planned the first Earth Day with an eye to attracting students and middle-class Americans, particularly those who dont customarily attend political or environmental events. We mobilized a constituency that until then was untapped, said Hayes.As a result of this outreach attempt, over 20 million people around the country came to the
first Earth Day on April 22,1970, making it a phenomenal success that politicians had no choice but to notice.With the momentum from Earth Day, the environmental movement unseated seven of the most powerful anti-environmental congressmen whom the environmentalists called the Dirty Dozen.^In terms of numbers, the environmental movement was unstoppable, said Hayes.Hayes thinks that the success of the first Earth Day can be repeated if more students work for incremental, not revolutionary, environmental and political change.The renowned activist advised his audience to get involved. Get organized ... The election isnt the end; its the beginning. As a student, you have more discretionary time at your disposal than at any other time in your life ... Youre a huge potential resource. Not just your votes, but what you can do. Its incredible.However, Carnegie Mellon political science professor Patrick Stroh thinks that most students are still uninterested in politics.Generationally, students are one ofthe most cynical groups.... They dont know the issues; they dont know how to influence the system, so they just forget it, Stroh said.In general, said Stroh, Students are apathetic, not registered to vote, and have competing demands on their time.The Times Mirror Center for the People and Press, a media group, seconds Strohs evaluation, criticizing todays youth as a generation that knows less, cares less, votes less and is less critical of its leaders and institutions than young people in the past.Census Bureau data seem to bear out this analysis. Not only does the 1990 census show overall voter participation dropping precipitously since 1972, the numbers reveal that the decrease is most marked among voters aged 18 to 24.A report released last year by People for the American Way appears to substantiate this trend. It stated that there is a citizenship crisis in which Americas youth are alarmingly ill-prepared to keep democracy alive. Some student political activists disagree. Julie Harris, a Columbia University student who worked on Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign and was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in July, believes that students are becoming more active, although often in local ways.According to Harris, Political systems respond to young people with energy to spare.... Students can sometimes relate better to a local issue than a more abstract national idea. If you pursue a local issue, you can see the effect

WASHINGTON, September 25 (DJ)  The Senate, on a 59-34 vote, stood behind two taxes on the wealthy that are opposed by President Bush.The measures phase out the ability of wealthy individuals to take advantage of the personal exemption and the itemized deductions. Current law calls for those provisions to sunset in 1997 and 1995, respectively.The $32.5 billion tax bill pending in the Senate would instead make them permanent. Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said Bush will veto any bill that includes the permanent extension of those taxes.Its a very sensitive issue for the President of the United States, particularly with some sixty days before the election, Dole said.The phase out of the personal exemption applies to joint filers making $160,000 annually. For itemized deductions, the phase out is $105,000 for joint filers. Dole had proposed to strike the provisions from the bill, as well as scale back a planned expansion of the Individual Retirement Account.
Regulation emerges as campaign issue
WASHINGTON, September 25 (DJ)  When President George Bush campaigned in Michigan recently, he warned that Bill Clintons plans for environmental regulation would cripple the auto industry and maim small businesses. Put a freeze on unnecessary federal regulation, the President shouted to cheering supporters. Were regulating ourselves to death!But when Democrat A1 Gore spoke at a similar rally, he said the problem with regulation today is the way the Bush administration drafts rules in secret to unfairly help business fat cats. Big business has a back door into the White House, Clintons running mate declared. It is a technique to allow the biggest polluters in this country to hotwire the regulatory process.As the heated rhetoric suggests, the stodgy subject of regulation has emerged as a sharp-edged campaign issue, and for ample reason, The Wall 
Street Journal reported. There are clear differences between the way Bush and Clinton administrations would operate the governments vast regulatory apparatus, which touches every home and workplace and costs the American economy tens of billions a year by some calculations. Those differences are made even sharper by the vice presidential candidates: Gore, who has written a book
P5l8ao,, uUUa5Mo, loI 
n,,7ul u7g UuiCu8o
calling the environment mankinds greatest challenge, and Dan Quayle, who has called regulation one of the countrys greatest enemies.Moreover, with a giant budget deficit limiting any Presidents ability to launch new programs, regulation could be one of the most important differences between a Clinton and a Bush presidency. With Democrats promising a more activist government, even moderate Democrats agree there would be more health and environmental regulation under a President Clinton. The Arkansas governor also promises, though, some new twists to lighten the burden on business. And he would radically reshape Quayles regulation-thwarting White House Council on Competitiveness. Bush, meanwhile, promises an all-out assault on regulation by extending his moratorium on new rules for one year and beginning a review to weed out old regulations. Bush aides are planning to introduce sunset procedures, under which many regulations would automatically die after a time. And Bush is currently allowing the Competitiveness Council to grow in power and stature.Some forces at work after the election will water down the stark differences now suggested by campaign rhetoric. N otwithstanding Bushs tough talk, regulation would almost surely grow in a second
Bush term, as it did in the first, according to some analyses. Thats because a large number of the costly provisions of the Clean Air Actpushed by Bush  are scheduled to kick in, and rolling back regulations takes nearly as much time and paperwork as creating new ones. And its wrong to simply assume that either candidate would govern the way he campaigns. Bush, despite his current rhetoric and a deregulatory role he held in the Reagan administration, launched some ofthe most costly regulatory programs in U.S. history during the first two years of his term, reversing a downward trend in regulatory costs that had begun under President Carter. Besides the Clean Air Act, he pushed through new health-care regulations, laws guaranteeing access for the disabled to public facilities, and some tougher financial rules on the heels of the savings-and-loan mess.Clinton, who promotes a host of new programs to toughen environmental standards, bowed to the poultry and timber industries in Arkansas when they objected to rules they said would cost jobs. Then again, as President, Clinton might feel the strongest pressure from the opposite direction: union and environmental advocates within his party eager to see their agendas enacted after 12 years out of the White House.
| WASHINGTON, September 25 (DJ)  A House-Senate conference committee approved compromise Russian aid legislation that would implement the U.S. share of a broader $24 billion aid plan backed by the Group ;of Seven major industrial nations.; Significantly, the panel agreed ;to put the proposed $12 billion ;U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ;on a two-track legislative process. But committee members did not indicate any concern that the two-track processfavored by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) 
i would endanger final congressional approval of the long- sought increase in IMF resources.This is really the basic blueprint for how we will deal with the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Absent this, we really are silent on the relationship."Among other things, the package would endorse U.S. participation in a ruble stabilization fund, clear nwuy Cold War-ora legislative burriors that impede government lending to the republics, authorize extension of agricultural credits, and expand
the use of American assistance in disarming Russia and other republics. U.S. officials consider the measure essential as a political statement of support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who directly appealed to Congress for help.The package contains restrictions on the Bush administration that generally hinge aid on a sustained Russian commitment to democracy, human rights, and weapons non-proliferation. It also includes language requiring the President to certify that significant progress is being made in withdrawing the 120,000 troops located in the Baltic states.Any administration tries to fight against any restrictions," said Ambassador Richard Armitage, who is coordinating the State Departments aid to the commonwealth. But all in all, were pleased.Lawmakers said they expect the House and Senate to vote on the package next week.Before the IMF funds are given final approval, however, both the House and Senate will have to approve the foreign operations spending bill, which includes the actual appropriation ofthe quota

WASHINGTON, September 25 (DJ)  A newly published account of the Iran-Contra affair suggests that President Bush became an important advocate for resuming the sale of U.S. arms to Iran at a crucial juncture in the operation in the summer of 1986, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.Written by former Air Force Major General Richard Secord, the book draws on Secords conversations with an Israeli governmentofficial who briefed Bush -------------------------that July in Jerusalem regarding the initiative. Frustrated by Tehrans performance, the U.S. hadadopted an all-or-nothing stance on future hostage transactions.Israel, meanwhile, hoped to persuade the White Houseto relax its standard and ________________pursue sales linking the re- lease of specific hostages to reciprocal shipments.Written notes from the Jerusalem meeting show that the then-vice president made no commitments at the time. But Secord quotes Amiram Nir, the Israeli official, as saying, Things couldnt have turned out better ... Bush was very attentive, very interested. In fact, immediately after the vice president returned to Washington to meet with President Ronald Reagan, the White House altered its position, and further sales were pursued. Since the President had been so adamant before, Secord writes, Nirs briefing must have been a doozy, moving Bush from note taker to advocate. Secords account is detailed in his book, Honored and
Betrayed, covering his long military career and subsequent role in carrying out the secret weapon sales and supplying arms to U.S.-backed insurgents in Nicaragua. Both operations were run from the White House and though Bush has denied knowing of the covert dealings with the Nicaraguan Contras at the time, Secord said he believed the vice presidents staff was more aware of the operation than has been admitted.
"The euphoria over [86 hostage releases], 
coupled with the Israeli briefing, caused 
Reagan to jump back on the lets-free-thehostages  bandwagon. 
r Major General Richard Secord
Nir, who was reported killed in a plane crash in Mexico in 1989, had been an adviser on counterterrorism to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. And he emerges in the Iran-Contra affair as an important intermediary between Jerusalem and the White House.Secord describes himself as having been on friendly terms with the Israeli and Secord said they continued to meet secretly in Europe after the operation became public in late-1986. He said that Nir described to him detailed notes and tapes recording elements of the affair and the general criticized the Israeli government for stonewalling and failing to make this evidence public.A White House spokesman called the
charges outrageous and said they were designed merely to sell more books.Though he described himself as supporting Bush in his re-election campaign, Secords account raises potential problems for th President. Bush has sought to distance himself from the Iran-Contra affair, but notes uncovered since 1988 appear to contradict the Presidents claim that he wasnt aware that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz were vigorously opposed to the Iran initiative. Indeed, the Secord book suggests the vice president was used by th Israelis to encourage the sales.The July 1986 brief- ingtookplacejustdays after the release of Lawrence Jenco, a Catholic priest who had been captured the previous year.The euphoria over that, coupled with the Israeli briefing, caused Reagan to jump back on the lets-free-the-hostages bandwagon, Secord said in an interview yesterday. Nothing in the book contradicts Bushs claim that he didnt know that profits from the sales were being used to circumvent a ban on U.S. funding for the Contras.

Senate passes revised 
smoking resolutionStudent government 
elections approachSMOKING, from page 1and common areas designated smoke free still remains an issue. Altmann said, At some point, I think we will do something about the Tartan [Lounge] because I think the complaints of non- smokers are legitimate, like having to wait in smoke filled checkout lines, and the poor ventilation, or circulation, of air.Altmann expressed his reluctance to let any bill pass that just prohibits smoking in areas like the Kiltie Court without having checked into other options that might be available. Altmann said, The problem is that the Tartan [Grill] is the only indoor, centrally located place where smoking is permitted, and smokers should have that kind of access; and until we can figure out a way people can smoke in that type of situation, I dont think its fair to pass an outright ban on smoking there. He said, We dont want to be fascist about where you can and cant smoke. Many students agree. H&SS sophomore Evie Remaley, when asked about the possibility of a smoking ban in the Kiltie Court, said, I think its an infringement on a persons rights and until they make smoking illegal in this country, then you cant ban smoking in public places.One solution to this is to install a better system of air ventilation and circulation in places like the Kiltie Court, so that the smoke from the smoking section will not spread throughout the entire cafeteria. Concerning ventilation, Altmann said, I think thats one of the main problems, and I dont
know how tough it would be, but if we could figure out how to ventilate ... the [Kiltie Court] better, then I think that would solve a lot of the problems ... that would be the best solution.Altmann said that he wants to wait until Physical Plant and the administration in Warner Hall are consulted about the feasibility of installing a better air system before we pass the resolution, and then we can draft the resolution fairly specifically and actually have some luck of its being implemented. Until then, Altmann does not think that a good solution is necessarily to pack all smokers into some crowded room where smoke doesnt circulate and makes it extra, extra unhealthy.Student sentiment on this resolution has been fairly mixed. Junior art major Terrence Ryan, when asked how he feels about the resolution, said simply, It sucks.Junior acting major Will Penick doubts that Campus Police will be able to enforce the policy. He said, Ive smoked in just about every building on campus, and I never even see Security. Graphic communications sophomore Deena Grinbaum said, I dont smoke so I dont really care, but I dont think that its fair to ban smoking from Skibo because, especially in the winter, there isnt anywhere inside to go and be able to smoke. The resolution does not bother sophomore IM major Ed Meier much either. He said, I smoke, but even now, if someone Im with asks me not to smoke around them, I wont; I respect their rights.

This semesters Student Senate elections will be held on November 9 and 10.Petitions for both one-semester and two-semes- ter seats will be accepted until late October. Anyone who wants to run for one of these positions can get a petition at the student government office in the Tartan Lounge. Senator Amy Potthast (H&SS) also recommends that these hopefuls should, before even turning in a petition, come to Senate meetings... and speak to Senators currently serving on the committees.As with any Student Senate election, voter participation is a concern. In previous elections, the percentage of eligible voters who actually vote has generally been low. Last falls voter turnout was 8.4 percent. Even the hotly-debated Resolution against Discrimination by ROTC referendum drew only 22.7 percent of the eligible voters at CMU last spring. Consequently, Student Senate is searching for ways to get more CMU students to vote in the elections. Shawn Knight (MCS), Senates Public Relations chair, said, I -will consider my term ... a great success if we can get a much higher percentage of the student body to contribute to elections.Senator Brian S. Engel (CIT) also expressed his concern about the lack of voter turnout. It frustrates me that people can go through anything for four years and not care enough to do the small things to change it. A great way to make a difference, here, is to be on Student Senate. That route is not feasible for all people, but at the very least
you should not only vote, but talk to your Senators about the problems on campus that affect you, said Engel. Senator Josh Knauer (H&SS) agrees, having said, I feel that it is very important for students to get out and express their views on campus issues, whether that be running for a Senate seat or just getting out to vote.Although this semesters Student Senate elections will proceed as usual for the voters, the election framework will be altered; this semesters election board will not be comprised of volunteers but paid employees of Student Senate.Because Student Senates constitution provides that Senate members may not handle election results, an election board was instituted to monitor elections, count votes, and verify that those elected are eligible for the positions for which they were elected.In the past, A Phi O governed Student Senate elections. However, last spring the fraternity announced that it would no longer assume the duties of the elections board.For last springs Student Senate elections, Student Senate found individual volunteers to fill the elections board. Student Senate Chair. Matt McGarvey expressed gratitude to A Phi O and these volunteers assistance, but he and the other members of the Executive Committee feel that voting results could be determined more expediently if the elections board members were given an incentive. Therefore, the committee unanimously approved the decision to pay this year's elections board. Anyone interested in working as a member of the elections board should see the posting on the cmu.misc.jobs bulletin board.

Environmentalist speaks in Skibo
ACTIVISM, from page 1you have.Environmental writer A.R. Hogan concurs, saying, Students cant turn a blind eye to the problems of our political system.... Change must come from both the outside and the inside. As a college student, youre in a position
to make that happen, no matter where you stand on issues. Hogan said, Also, join in voter registration drives. Theyre a great non-partisan way to get involved in politics. In the past week, student groups on campus have been active in getting out the vote. Last Friday, the Col
lege Republicans gave out voter registration cards on campus. The Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC) organized the Campus Green Vote Conference last Monday and Thursday. This group handed out voter registration cards, encouraging registration and voting.

9/18 HARASSMENT, 2 pm. Astudent said he was leaving a bar at closing time along with eight of his friends. His friends asked for a ride home, but the student said he would drive only himself because he did not want that many people crammed in his car, and the walk to campus was very short. His intoxicated friends retaliated by jumping all over his car. The student was upset by their behavior and said he hit the horn and wanted to drive away. Eventually, the victims friends moved on. The vehicle sustained no damage.

Mehrabian supports International Festival
INTERNATIONAL, from page 1represent.Mehrabian said the International Festival is not just for international students; it is for all studonts. He said, When our current students enter the job market, they will be entering a very worldly environment. They will be working for global companies and ... competing in a global economy. To teach Carnegie Mellon students how to be effective in this worldly environment, Mehrabian formed the International Awareness Committee, which has been concentrating on expanding campus involvement in programs and activities of a global nature, according to Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS and chair of the International Awareness Committee.Mehrabian adds that the International Festival is something in which everybody can participate, so that students can gain the experience and knowledge of being exposed to other cultures. He has taken this idea beyond the festival and started an Office of International Education, which he has since staffed with new faculty that helped him start the Centre de Tours French exchange program; increase agreements, awareness, and understanding with students about foreign exchange; and connect CMU with other programs in such countries as Mexico, Japan, and Germany. He said, The overall direction ... is [toward] our responsibility to educating our students.Both students and faculty are looking forward to the International Festival. Mehrabian [feels] good about it. There are good volunteers involved, [and] you cant get this help with just money. Khan said that over the next few years, the increasing level of activity through the Activities Board, the Concert Series, and the Lecture Series will provide an international flavor... not just a few days but throughout the year. Loomis said, The Latin American [Festival] probably benefits student life on the CMU campus more than any other programs by Warner Hall.This year, Carnegie Mellon studonts and staff get a taste of the Caribbean and Latin America; next year, African cultures become the International Festivals focus.

Letters to the Editor
The International Festival, ini
tiated as a regular event last 
year, is returning to campus in 
October.
As students, we have to ask 
why a Warner Hall project, un
der the auspices of the Office of 
the President, is being partially 
paid for by the Student Activi
ties Fee. Why is it that the Ad
ministration needs to come to 
Student Senate asking for 
money to help support this 
event?
This happened last year, when 
the International Festival asked 
Senate for $5000 and got it. 
Thats ten times the amount a 
new student organizations first 
budget can be. Aliya Khan, who 
coordinates the festival, prom
ised Senate that she wouldnt be 
back for more msney this year. 
However, Khan returned this 
year asking, yet again, for $5000. 
It would seem that the Interna
tional Festival people didnt do 
as good a job as was expected in 
planning and budgeting.
Some Senators wanted to 
refuse funding altogether, but 
Senate ended up giving in and 
handing over $3000 for the Fes
tival. This is still six times the 
amount allowed a new 
organizations budget.
When asked, Michael Murphy, 
dean of Student Affairs, said 
that the International Festival
Student Senate currently has 
ten vacancies. This represents 
approximately one third of Sen
ate. Many of these vacancies 
have been caused by resigna
tions, and they have not been 
filled because of student apa
thy.
When a Senator is elected or 
appointed, he or she has an ob
ligation to serve for an entire 
term. There are some legitimate 
reasons for resigning, such as 
class conflicts. Senators should 
not resign just because they no 
longer feel like working on Sen
ate, or because they decide they 
like another activity better. A 
seat on Senate is both a privi
lege and an obligation. Sena
tors should not take a seat in 
the first place if they know they 
will not have the time. If they 
have personality conflicts with 
other Senators they should deal 
with them. Resigning from a 
leadership position in any orga
nization without a legitimate 
reason is irresponsible; resign
ing from Student Senate, the 
organization which represents 
the entire student body, is inex
cusable.
Students should take respon
sibility for governing the Uni
versity. Student government is 
the active voice of the students 
in policy making. If youve ever 
thought about joining Senate, 
nows the time to do it; if you 
havent, nows the time to think 
about it. Dont let the vacancies 
stand, leaving you unrepre
sented.
Any member of the Student 
Body can become a member of 
Student Senate if there is a va
cancy in his or her college. If you
didnt really need the Activities 
Fee money, but that it would be 
nice for Senate to co-sponsor 
the event.
While Murphy is correct, and 
this is a very nice idea, there is 
little reason for it to become 
reality, considering that Sen
ate already runs low on Activi
ties Fee cash every year. Also, 
if asking Senate for money was 
the plan, it would have been 
better for the administration to 
approach Senate before any of 
the printing had been com
pleted, so that the literature 
could have read funded in part 
by the Activities Fee and co
sponsored by Student Senate. 
Of course, the already-printed 
literature says no such thing, 
which is hardly appropriate if 
Activities Fee funds are going 
to be involved.
Besides, if the Office of Stu
dent Affairs doesnt need stu
dent money, there is absolutely 
no reason that it should ask for 
student money. This is an un
acceptable state of affairs. Sen
ate should not have even briefly 
considered the administrations 
request, and shouldve clearly 
remembered the promise made 
by Khan not to return with her 
hand out. Senate should not 
have funded the International 
Festival once, let alone twice, 
anditmustneverhappen again.
would like to fill one of the va
cancies in Senate, we strongly 
suggest you first attend some 
Senate meetings to see what 
its like. If you decide you would 
like to be a Senator, you need to 
pick up a petition from the Stu
dent Senate office in the Tartan 
Loft or the Skibo Information 
Desk and get 25 signatures from 
students in your college. Then, 
at the next meeting of Senate, 
you must be approved by a 2/3 
vote of Senate.
The following colleges have 
one seat open in Senate: MCS, 
GSIA, H&SS, SCS, and CIT. 
Heinz and CFA both have two 
open seats. Since the Heinz 
School has only two seats in 
Senate, Heinz students are cur
rently not represented at all. 
One other open seat is the mis
cellaneous students seat. This 
Senator represents all students 
who are not in any other col
leges, such as students in the 
Information and Networking 
Institute and the Robotics In
stitute. Students in these col
leges are also without any rep
resentation in Senate right now. 
The only college which pres
ently has full representation in 
Senate is IM.
Student Senate could be called 
the most important organiza
tion on campus. It distributes 
the Activities Fee, it makes de
cisions about what organiza
tions on campus can do, and 
most importantly, it represents 
the student body of Carnegie 
Mellon. We call upon Senators 
holding office to do their j obs for 
their entire term, and we call 
upon the student body to fill the 
vacancies in Senate.

attention on campus
Editor: s=*How is it that, after iStt!i,"iurA VC7S5 s7e ~dsix weeks of operation,--------------------------
The Tartan has yet to Letter towrite a story about the the Edjt()r Graduate Coffeehouse?Perhaps there are more newsworthy issues elsewhere. Or, more likely, this lack of coverage is one more example of the continued marginal treatment of graduate students on this campus.The Graduate Coffeehouse is both a powerful political statement by graduate students and a wonderful contribution to the social atmosphere at Carnegie Mellon. The Coffeehouse has a history, founding members, and a message, and has changed this University. Its story deserves to be told.

Volleyball team upset 
with Tartan coverage
Editor:For the past four years, the volleyball team has put up with incredible articles by The Tartan  articles which are negative in perspective, articles in which the writer creates a match which they did not see from the scores they were given, articles written by someone who not only wasnt at the match, but quite possibly has never even seen one. Our absence from The Tartan for the previous two issues was the last straw, and we finally decided to take matters into our own hands.Several members of the team complained to the editors about the lack of coverage, and they were assured that the problem would be solved. However, since no one on the team was contacted for quotes or for information on our schedule, we decided to write our own article to give us the positive coverage we have deserved for the past four years and certainly deserve now that we have a winning season, which is very hard to do when you play as many matches against as many different teams as we do. We are 10-6 and damn proud of it.Joanna Downer volunteered to write an article for last weeks Tartan to catch CMU up with more than two weeks of
our season. The article was written Sunday morning and taken to The Tartan office and submitted for printing.Since we are quite used to being misquoted, we were interested to see what would be done with the article. It was intentionally long so that it could be edited without changing the perspective, because it was not known how much room was available.Monday certainly brought us a surprise, as the sports editor claimed the byline, which had been Val E. Baul in an effort not to show that we wrote the article ourselves. In addition to this, changes were made to the article and title unnecessarily which are obvious because of their negative attitude, incorrectness (there is a big difference between winning eight of 10 games and eight of 10 matches, which is what we did), and the omission of direct quotes from players, who were the only people actually there.As sports editor, Josh Linder should know the difference between editing and plagiarising. If he doesnt, maybe he should get a new job.The bottom line is that we shouldnt have to write our own articles in order to get fair, positive coverage. If we do, because we are the only members of the campus at most of our matches, then the integrity of the article should be respected. The Sports section of The Tartan needs to work on providing positive, equal coverage of all sports, even womens.

Education far more 
Important than ranking
Editor:I read with great interest the cover story about CMUs rank among the top educational institutions in the country. I cant be proud of the rankings, however, simply because they are not worth the paper they are printed on. During my career, I have been a student at three well-regarded universits and was closely associated with a fourth. I have also visited numerous other universits. Based on my personal experiences, I can tell you that the rankings are meaningless. Let me be somewhat more specific. My undergrad school, RPI, and CMU both suffer froir the problem of a low graduation rate. J. this a problem that should reflect upon the schools national rank? Certainly not! I claim that the low graduation rate is a tribute to the difficulty of obtaining a quality undergraduate education and the quality of the students who do succeed in graduating. As a counter example, I offer Brown University (which almost certainly ranked ahead of CMU). In 1983, to get a degree from Brown, one simply took 28 courses. Period. How can they not fail to have a high graduation rate with a setup like that? Does that make Brown a superior school to CMU or RPI? Certainly not! I recall having conversations with EE majors there who had only taken two or three more courses in EE than I did, but I was an MechE! The article also seems to indicate that the ranking was based primarily on the quality of the undergraduate education received, and not the research done at the university. I can accept this. But, if CMU is interested in advancing in this ranking, why have several of the very best teachers in CIT been denied tenure? I know it is heresy to suggest this, but shouldnt those faculty who have proven to be gifted teachers be allowed to continue doing so, even if they dont generate as many research dollars as their colleagues? CMU is a far better school than reflected in the USN&WR survey. Should the adminstration make changes that will improve our ranking in this meaningless poll, it will probably have a negative impact on the quality of the education received here.

Ive had a couple of very strange nightmares lately, and I wonder if you might help me psychoanalyze myself.In the first dream, which Ive had several times, I enter a mall through one of its anchor department stores  a Penneys or Homes, for example. To get to the central part of the mall, I have to
pass through the perfume department. Just before I am out of the store, a Perfume Person approaches me and says, You really must try this scent today, and sprays some on my neck. Puzzled, I walk out of the store and into the center of the mall.Instead of a variety of storefronts, there are only entrances to other department stores, and these entrances are all perfume departments. I walk toward the next store, and I see a Perfume Person standing at the entrance. I notice, though, that the Perfume Person is dividing, like
an amoeba, into two Perfume People. By the time I get to the front of this store, the two Perfume People spray me. I move quickly toward the next store, where four Perfume People are waiting.To get out of the mall, I have to go back through a perfume department. Panicing, I try to crash a line of Perfume People. I fail, and they grab me and carry me to a counter that they have filled with perfume. They throw me into the perfume bath and hold my head under so that I cant breathe.Then I wake up.The other dream is shorter
 Im riding an elevator in a building that I think is part of Morewood Gardens. A couple gets on. The man, for some reason, has decided to use his years supply of cologne in one day. The woman, determined that her hair not move an inch, has used her years supply of hair spray. The elevator malfunctions, and we become stuck between floors.I realize that I will soon lose consciouness and suffocate, so I take off my shoes, rub my wool socks on the carpeted floor, and touch Mr. Macho- Studley and Ms. Hair Queen

Students dont realize how good CMU is
es55,o Csllaormou
Today I am experiencing something that I will probably never be able to feel again  a sort of history in the making. As I walk around the campus of CMU, through the halls, cafeterias, and even on the Cut, I see more than just the many different faces mingling with one anotherI see all the cultural and social backgrounds that make up each individual. This is the one place where I can honestly say that it does not matter who you are, whetheryou are bl ack or white or Asian, and it does not even matter if you are from a different state or a different country and getting your first taste of America; everyone is welcome at CMU. There are no ethnic boundaries keeping different people from becoming friends, for it is this very difference that makes the friendships sospecial. Whetheritbeawoman
from India having lunch with a skater dude, or a group of foreign students and Americans playing football, it is a pleasant reassurance to see that such interaction and boundary-crossing is possible. Even though the United States was developed as the melting pot of the world, reaUty shows us the harsh truth that different is not always welcome. Such is not the case at Carnegie Mellon. While other universities are separated by ethnic and social barriers, CMU is, in itself, the world united in a common goal  to achieve.Now that I have been here for a couple of weeks, I realize that it is not only the students that make such a difference at CMU, it is also the faculty and administration. Although many of us as students do not like to admit when faculty members are doing something good, and we especially focus on the problems with the administration, if you are a freshman or if Carnegie Mellon is the first college you have attended, you do not realize how much worse it could be. I just want to take this opportunity to tell you how
lucky you really are as students at CMU. When I first began corresponding with the University during the summer, it came as such a shock to me when my advisor actually remembered who I was since the last time I had talked to her. At the community college where I transferred
ests I wanted to pursue. I also did not realize what an acUustment it would be to come from a community college to a university like Carnegie Mellon.Again, it was quite a shock to my system to find the faculty and administration more than willing to work with me on an indiI knew CMU had to be something 
special when I would call my advisor 
after a month or so and find that she 
would still remember my name, what 
majors I applied for...
from, which was a lot smaller than Carnegie Mellon, the counselors and administrators could not remember my gender when they sent me mail, let alone my name. I knew CMU had to be something special when I would call my advisor after a month or so and find that she would still remember my name, what majors I applied for, and what intervidual basis to meet my specific needs. Many of the faculty members I have met seem to really take an interest in their students what a unique concept for a school!Part of what makes Carnegie Mellon so different for me are the many organizations around campus. There is something for everyone and a number of opportu
nities to meet new people. Some of the classes are not very invigorating, but in others where you are being taught by some of the best in the business and have opportunities to work side by side with the professionals, it is an exciting experience. No, the food is not the greatest and the computer clusters are really a pain, but if you look beyond the little annoyances, we are in the ultimate environment for learning and growing as independent individuals.Even though Carnegie Mellon is traditionally a technical school, there is such a diverse group of people that blend together here that it is just as easy to focus on the variety of individuals as it is to emphasize the schools noted fields. I think experiencing the campus atmosphere is just as important as the classes offered at CMU. Both are a part of a growing experience that you could not get anywhere else .

Planning will preserve American Dream
ngCg iM,UU
According to some of the media and some of the politicians, the American Dream is dying or dead, with blame often attributed to a failing government. The government, however, is not responsible for how we make use of our individual economic resources. We should question what role the American people play in sustaining their own economic prosperity and that of future generations.If our generation is not expected to do as well as our parents, then the reasons and solutions can be found in individual choices. The outlook of how economic prosperity is achieved needs to be examined.The ultimate economic success in America is often considered the purchase of a home. Because real estate prices dramatically increased during the 80s, that standard can no longer be achieved in the same ways. Those who still look to purchase a house in their twenties or early thirties are looking towards a goal that is not necessarily achievable.With life expectancy as long as it is now, we need to shift our expectations of financial goals. Saving to buy a house may take longer than before, but the enjoyment of that luxury will last far longer than it previously had. Achieving goals, such as buying a house, takes long term planning and sacrifice.The low saving rate of Americans certainly does not point to long term planning by most people. The blame for the lack of saving is that many Americans are having to live from pay check to pay check, but what are people doing with those pay checks?
Many people are paying off consumer debts  at interest rates of 18 percent. Americans love to buy the newest and best products available. Credit cards are the means to pay for these products. The influx of consumer electronics is an example of an area where people of all economic levels spend money on items that once did not exist, but now seem to be essential. Like electronics, fashion is another area that consumers spend a lot of money. Buying a $100 pair of sneakers may impress your
security for twenty years after retirement. We need to change our habits instead of expecting some magic economy to shower us with dollar bills.Middle class blue collar workers and their families are being used by the media as the examples of the death of the American Dream. The previous blue collar generation got ahead through strong union jobs, and now their children dont have a chance because the good paying union jobs are gone or disappearing quickly, or at
Investment is needed for the future. Consumers 
cannot stop spending all together but... more 
planning would ensure a fighting chance at the 
future. Sacrifice when you are in your twenties 
might make the difference fifty years later...
friends, but certainly does not help long term prosperity.Investment is needed for the future. Consumers can not stop spending all together, but a little more planning would ensure a fighting chance at the future. Some sacrifice when you are in your twenties might make the difference fifty years later, yet how many people think beyond the next pay check? Beyond savingfor items such as a house, there are financial responsibilities such as childrens educations and retirement.When people start working, the furthest thing from their mind is retirement. However, if the same amount of money is saved every year until retirement the compound- inginterestmakes nearly half of the amount at retirement from the first ten years of savings. That type of long range outlook is not easy, but neither is living on social
least that is the impression the media and politicians give. The problem is that the current generation of blue collar workers is trying to achieve success the same way their parents did, and that just is not possible any more.As technology develops, blue collar jobs will disappear. Companies will be able to break unions as the number of positions decrease but the number of workers remains the same. Those left without jobs will need education for other types of work, either through college or some other type of education. Why isnt that happening?In 1988, a Time article profiled a typical working class American family. The father has achieved the American Dream (i.e. bought a house, supported his family, etc:), but his children are not doing nearly as well as he had. Despite the fathers success, his children struggle in low pay
ing jobs without much hope. The problem is that his success occurred without a college education, it was assumed that the same was possible f6r his children.The father was able to give his son money for a down payment on a small house. If they planned better for the future, the money could have been better used if he had paid college tuition for his son instead, giving him a better chance for sustained economic success.Although the article in Time is specific to one family, it points out the general failure of some parts of our parents generation to prepare many of us for a changing economy. Although a private university education is out of reach for many families, a college education in general is not.Many state and community colleges cost less than $5000 dollars a year, and some a lot less. If someone right out of high school lived at home and worked part time, some type of education is definitely possible. Certainly someone trying to get through school while working is not going to get the same education that we are privileged to get at CMU, but they wont be making $10,000 dollars a year because they couldnt get a scarce union job. A college education does not guarantee a large income, but in general, college graduates earn considerably more money than non-college graduates.It would be great to say there is some single solution to ensuring economic success for every American, but the reality is that conscious planning and sacrifice are needed to prepare ourselves and the next generation for a changing economy and society. The American Dream is not dead, but how we achieve it does need to change.

Until last week,Ihadjust about had it with the students of Carnegie Mellon. Nothing controversial like last years resolution was happening in Student Senate, only a few of my friends were actually interested in the current political campaigns, and there was a definite lack ofintellectual discourse. In short, no one discussed anything of value.Given the nature of the workload here at CMU, this really shouldn't have surprised me. After all, there are times when even the most worldly and up-to- date person succumbs to exam pressure and ends up a little clueless as to whats going on here at CMU, not to mention Bosnia-Herzegovina.Salvation soon shone on the Cut, however. Ready to tackle the important issues and stimu
late thought-provoking, eye-opening debate, the College Republicans took it upon themselves to conduct a detailed examination of the platforms of George Bush and Bill Clinton. Yes, well armed
it, leftist writings such as Bush + Qualye = Recession, Clinton + Gore = Recovery, and Equal Rights for Gays + Lesbians desecrated the fence.Response was quick and deciDavid Byler, a freshman in CIT, 
proposed action by a/dvocating going 
to the play advertised on the other 
side of the fence to "boo the fag 
actors.
with facts and theories, they proceeded to educate the campus community about the real issues, the ones to which the media and the voters havent paid enough attention.Apparently, members of the College Republicans painted the fence during the weekend. Daring to confuse the issues, some liberals painted over the fence. Because someone failed to guard
sive. Stephen Gordon, a freshman in MCS, posted on the assocs.collegerepublicans bboard that he wondered if anyone would get mad at gas the queers written on the fence. He said that it probably wasnt a good idea. But think about it. When youre mad and such things pollute our campus, you need strong responses.The members werent about to beat around the bush (no pun
intended) when it came to discussing the important things. David Byler, a freshman in CIT, advocated a direct approach with clear and concise language, refreshingly free of political rhetoric, that would stand up to the limp-wristed, democrat, CFAers. He even proposed action by advocating going to the play advertised on the other side of the fence to boo the fag actors.So, through a night of cold rain, they painted the fence. When morning broke, their messages were there, ready to enlighten the ignorant, and to dispell the double-speak, to bring about progress through open and honest discussion.If one approached close enough to read the yellow on white writing, several memorable and moving quotes were to be read. The reader was forced to question the issue of honesty in fulfilling campaign promises with Clinton lies ... in other womens beds.Closer to Doherty Hall, the College Republicans examined military spendingissues with ROTC NOT FEMINAZI. Unfortunately, most of the other writings were incomprehensible. I wish otherwise, as I love stimulating viewpoints.Even though I have only slight disagreements with the College Republicans on some of these important issues, Im glad they took the first step in opening the debate. As Patrick Gallagher, a freshman in MCS, put it, at least they didnt blindly swallow empty rhetoric by giving in to such people as communists, liberals, homosexuals, Fine Art majors, feminazis, peace mongers, and vegetarians.Luckily for those interested, however, the debate didnt stop there. Patrick Gallagher tackled the issue of women in politics by deconstructing the beliefs of Hillary Clinton.He did quite an extensive job. Noticably lacking in his argument were the typical code-word sound

Continued from PERFUME, page 6
at the same time. The resulting static electricity sparks cause the flammable couple to explode, incinerating them and blowing a hole in the top of the elevator. I am miraculously unharmed, and I climb out through the hole to safety.Do these dreams reveal some irrational fear of perfume, cologne, and hairspray?Im pretty sure that they do, but I think I know whats been triggering them. In the past few weeks, Ive had a few too many instances of being caught in on-the-way-to-class crowds at 8:25 am and having trouble breathing because someone ahead of me got a little carried away with some personal care chemical.The perfume/cologne users probably just want to smell nice, but some of them
turn into overzealous commandos in a War of Scents. This war exacts a heavy price in collateral damage to the lungs and noses of people around them. They underestimate the strikingrange oftheir weapons. The victims of campus chemical warfare tend not to complain, since most of the warriors arent trying to cause harm, and the victims hate to offend them.The chemical warfare comparison seems more accurate when were talking about hairsprays, many of which smell surprisingly similar to certain variants of the insecticide Raid.When people douse their hair in bugspray, people like myself empathize with the insects in the TV commercials, who constantly live in fear of being gassed.When something as horrific as chemi
cal warfare is happening right here on campus, Im sure you can understand why I have nightmares. Maybe you have them, too. If you do, maybe you can think of a solution to the problem of chemical excess. Suggest it to your Student Senator.I cant think of many good solutions. Maybe if we had nice powder rooms in all of the academic buildings, people would be less inclined to go heavy on perfume and cologne at the beginning of the day. Maybe if more people had short, straight hair, the hairspray problem would evaporate.In the meantime, Ill just walk around campus wearing a gas mask.

Continued from REPUBLICANS, page 7bites that have made elections nothing more than marketing games. With depth and accuracy, he noted that Hillary Clinton was a radical feminist and therefore a destroyer of the family and family values.It is indeed unfortunate that many members of the campus community did not have the opportunity to see the fence. The very next day, those sorority girls, as David Hanekamp referred to them, painted a birthday wish on it. While I cant find any proof as of yet, Im sure that they used the birthday advertisement as a cover for their feminist, liberal, homosexual, secular humanist tactics of suppressing conservative speech.I, for one, am willing to stand up to
these promoters of moral depravity and congratulate the College Republicans for their courage and resolve. With witiness, grace, and determination, they have brought to light the important problems that this country must deal with if it is to regain its former glory.Some people proposed the idea of painting the fence red, white, and blue. Gentlemen, Im glad to see youre tackling the tough issues.

cul,
Standing on the comer of Forbes and Smithfield, I waited to catch the 54C back to school. It was a particularly cold evening last December, and I made a mental note to get back to campus and check the score in the Penguins - Capitals game.Rubbing my hands together, I looked across the street at a local watering hole, that seemed to be having a convention. Apparently the Daughters of the American Revolution were holding their monthly meeting, and through the windows, I caught a glimpse of the game on the TV above the bar. The Pens had lost 6-4.While I was rubbing my hands with glee and thinking of the many possible ways I could add insult to injury, the doors to the bar were flung open and two old women bedecked in Penguins paraphenalia teetered unsteadily in the threshold of the doorway. Ah, I thought to myself, two Pens superfans.This ought to be good. Climbing down the stairs, the two gripped each others arms to keep from falling down.Mildred, this road is soooo crooked, one of the ladies said.I swear her name was Mildred. She was in rare form. Liquored up like a true hockey fan, the Penguins pins that covered her jersey clinked together as the pair navigated the road crossing.
Margaret, I cant see ... I need my glasses, the other crooned. So Mildred had hit the punch bowl too. I didnt think that her glasses would have helped her now.Mildreds jersey was just as worn as Margarets. Some old players name written in gold letters faded to a kind of sickly yellow was stitched to the back.I had never heard of him, and hes probably already dead.Finally the two made it 
across the street, and stood wobbling next to me at the bus stop.
Stevens played very well tonight.... Hes such a nice boy, Mildred spoke with a kind of glazed look in her eye.Yes these were true hockey superfans. Two old women with not much else but hockey in their veins (and a little Southern Comfort). I felt humbled in their presence, the kind of feeling youd get when you look at the Mona Lisa. These were fans that followed the Penguins before Stanley Cup glory came to the Steel City. They were probably fans of the original Pittsburgh Hockey Club, before the Penguins.
And you can tell right off the bat if a fan is a true fan or if they followed the team because the players are now all wearing Stanley Cup rings. And its always these pseudo-fans who go nuts when you criticize their team. Real fans bear themselves with quiet dignity, through good times and bad times. They dont feel the need to defend the teams actions. After all, Theyre all such nice boys.
I decided to keep my mouth shut. Mildred and Margaret, I salute you.

Once we scored the first goal, the game was over, coach Nick Gaudioso said of the Tartan Mens Soccer Teams 3-0 victory over a fledgling Point Park College team last Wednesday.The Tartans dominated the game everywhere but on the scoreboard in the first half, and when sophomore Pat Lucignani tallied his second career goal with 16 minutes remaining in the half, the game was indeed over.I think the problem with those kind of games is that youre worried about just getting one goal at first, Gaudioso said.We were missing shots, missing goals, and they were getting confident. I was getting a little frustrated, but once we scored, they werent going to score.Gaudioso explained his teams early nervousness, which caused them to capitalize on only three of 23 shots.No doubt they were looking past them. Of course they were. Its hard not to. Its a new program, and they played the right way.They played for one goal, and had they got that, who knows what might have happened.In this kind of situation [with CMU the overwhelming favorite] you [the coach] want to get that one goal, and once you get that one goal, everything settles down. No doubt I was pushing them [the Tartans] so the hype came from me. I knew eventually they [Point Park] would give in.Point Park played a very defensive game, with coach Richard Albarano utilizing the time honored underdog strategy  try to shut out the other team, and
hope you get lucky on offense.It didnt work.Point Park managed only a pair of sustained offensive attacks, and managed to get off only one shot on goal, and CMU junior goalkeepers Dave Shapiro and D an Warren did not have to make a save the entire game. ^However, Point Park did stay in the game for quite a while, as CMU had a difficult time converting on their shooting opportunities. Five minutes after Lucignani scored, senior John Stivoric tallied a goal, and 10 minutes into the second half, sophomore Alex Amezquita sealed the game.Lucignani scored after a
scramble in the penalty area, when Amezquita won the ball and dished it into the center, where Lucignani slammed the ball off a Point Park defender and into the goal, with the deflection wrong-footing Pioneer goalie Paul Zeise.Amezquita racked up his second assist when he sent a long pass from the corner in front of the goal, where Stivoric headed it past a diving Zeise.Sophomore Vince Russell returned the favor for Amezquita, hanging a corner kick in the zone, where Amezquita outjumped a defender and headed the ball into the net.

The girls soccer team dropped another close game this week.They were defeated 3-1 in overtime by California University. According to coach Julie Shackford, It was a well fought game on both ends.The Tartans opened up the scoring by capitalizing on a free luck.The goalie got a piece of the ball, sending it off the crossbar. The rebound came out to freshman Christina Isaly who knocked it in for the 1-0 lead.With seven minutes remaining in the half, California took a corner kick. The Tartan defense left a girl open, resulting in a goal and a 1-1 game at the half.The second half went the same way with chances at both ends.The few chances we did have, we didnt convert on, commented Shackford. After fourty-five minutes of play, the scored remained tied.Shackford attributed some of the defenses success to senior defenseman Sonya Chmielnicki.She was given the assignment of covering Californias leading scorer, Kim Kottmeier.Also, it was Chmielnickis first full game back from an injury,Though she was still not at 100 sively.
percent, she did a fine job of shutting down Kottmeier.The game went into overtime and the referee began to play his whistle like french horn, calling everything in sight. 8:25 intoO.T., this rampage of fouls cost the Tartans the game. California scored on a free kick, giving them the lead. From that point on, the team broke down and fell apart. Later in overtime, California added another goal on a free kick to end the scoring at 3-1.The team has a tough schedule ahead, as it prepares to face Seton Hill College on Wednesday. Seton Hill is ranked nationally in the NAIA. Last season, the Tartans lost a defensive battle to Seton Hill, 1-0. They are looking to play the same kind of game this timp as well. The Tartans are also looking at a difficult road trip next weekend, facing two of the sections toughest teams. On Frij* day they face Brandeis before going against first place Rochesr ter on Sunday.Though the team has facod a difficult season thus far, it is stay? ing optimistic. Says Shackford! Weve had our chances, wo just havent gotten a lucky bronk.f She continues, The girls are hanging in there and doing wolli We just need to tighten up dofon*

On Saturday Pittsburgh hosted its annual Head of the Ohio Regatta, opening the start of the 1992 fall season of rowing races. Among the schools in attendance were: Carnegie MellonUniversity, Cornell, MIT, Brown, Notre Dame, Ohio State, University of Pittsburgh, Michigan State, Mercyhurst College, Loyola College, Dowling College, University of Tennessee at Chatanooga, Grand Valley College, Brock College, (a Canadian crew) and several crew clubs, including the Three Rivers Rowing Association.Carnegie Mellon entered eight boats and had over 42 different people rowing for the team which, as Coach Liz Winter said, is a good start to the season. Commenting further she added, taking ino consideration that we a third division school and rowed against some first dicision crew sxuch as Brown, Cornell and MIT, we made a good showing. If fact, iw would be like CMUs football team playing a first division school such as Penn State.Of the eight boats entered, the Mens Club eight boat medaled withabronze at a time of12:03.73, just a mere five seconds behind Duquesne, who won the race in a time of 11:58.63. The Rowers were graduate students Glenn Pasecwicz, Chris McConnell, and John Cosek, CMU staff members Randy Simmons and Chris Fet
ter, sophomores Soren Roth and 
John Pasecwicz, and alumnus Bill Posega, with coxswain Senior Opal Perry.In the womans division the Open Eight placed seventh our of eleven at a time of 13:46.76 with Cornell taking first. Coach Winter remarked, An excellent performance. It was the first time that we rowed a crew up in the Open divison, as opposed to the club division. A very promising transition for us. Rowers for the boat were Perry,alumni, Dorie Martin, Susan Engleert, Anna Loney, Ann Caretto, Lui^i Grauel, Martha Moran, graduate student Julia Evans, with coxswain Molly Johnson.The mens lightweight A boat palced fifth at a time of 12:19.90 against Cornell who won the race. Of them, Winter replied, they had an excellent row. Rowers were, Fetter, sophomore Kevin Luczkow, senior Dave Shin, senior Tom Cillogly, freshman Howard Meisner, alumnus Eugene Zilberstein, alumnus Bill Posega, and Simmons, with Perry as coxswain.A Womens Club eight was entered and finished eight out of ten at a time of 14:18.35 with MIT winning the race. As our B boat theydid just fine considering it was our second boat and carrying the CMU banner, responded Coach Winter. Rowers were, senior Sarah Gibby, graduate student Jennifer Braun, sophomore Kersten Buttler, junior Katarina Midelfort, graduate
student Lara Wolfson, sophomore 
Amy Lefkowitz, and sophomore Julia Kuo, with senior Asha Puttaiah as coxswain.As for the boats with four rowers in them, known as fours in rowing terminology, coach Winter classified them as non-prior- ity boats, for they had never practiced together as crews.The mens lightweight four A boat finished in ninth place at a time of 14:00.96 in a race that Cornell took first place in. Rowing in the boat were Posega, Simmons, Shin, and alumnus Darryl Kauric.The mens lightweight four B boat came in at a time of14:35.05. Its rowers were Zilberstein, freshman Jeff Ku, graduate student Tse-Sung Wu, and alumnus Arthur Mcnair with King as coxswain. The womens club four A boat clocked in at a time of 16:10.58 and placed 16th. Rowers were: Gibby, Kuo, Wolfson, and sophomore Karen Knepper with Puttaiah a coxswain.The womens club four B boat placed 14th at a time of 15:43.27 while Three Rivers Rowing team won the race overall. Rowers were Braun, King, Midelfort, and senior Beth Ward with Puttaiah as coxswain.Coach Winter summed up the results of the Head of Ohio by saying, We rowed against some third division crews who we see at the Dadvail in the Spring. We made a good showing and it is definitely a good start to the season.

Officials dont deserve union
NFL FOOTBALL
by Dave Martin
. I really hate the Dallas i Cowboys, and the Miami Dol- 'phins, for that matter. I have always hated them. I used to hate the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders. Im learning to dislike the Washington Redskins, but all this negative feeling towards sports Iteams is inconsequential. When ;two teams take the field, theres ireally only one group I really despise, and thats the officials.Im sure if you bother watching ;any sport with teams, youve learned that there are teams you like, teams you dislike, and then there are the officials, whom you !root for to get demolished by some giantlineman, or whom you laugh at when a running back jukes right into the poor guy standing on the sideline. When you think about it, the treatment of NFL officials is pretty cruel. Theyre respected, at least somewhat, but Im sure they get insulted more regularly than most people. And in this light, maybe it makes sense to create an NFL officials union.These guys get to go out on the football field every week and risk life and limb and personal security every time they make a bad call. So, for reasons that havent really been stated here thus far, they are trying to pull 
one over on the NFL owners and create an organization that will ;makelifeeasierforthem. Nomore ;two day trips for people who live ,in Tampa Bay to preside over a 'game in Green Bay between the Packers and the Colts, or some such nonsense.One good point to the possible formation of an NFL officials union is that they might go out of
their way to get injured, or create an injury on the field. (One can imagine that one of the benefits to getting hit on the field might be a couple weeks at home, paid for by the National Football League.) This would make for some rather amusing scenes during a game. I can see my least favorite referee, Jerry Markbreit, watching Tim Harris about to crush Bobby Hebert, and decide that he hasnt spent enough time at home and rush to Heberts rescue, pushing Hebert away at the last moment, only to be picked up and slammed to the surface at Candlestick Park. Of course, the Saints would score on this play, but at least Jerry wouldnt be out there screwing things up and making a nuisance of himself.In a related vein, NFL viewers may have noticed that there is no instant replay this year. (There is a God!) Need I say that Im overjoyed by this fact. Okay, Im overjoyed by this fact. I believe human error keeps the hatred of the vile officials alive, and that the testing of such a thing as instant replay is a foolish idea. Mistakes made by the officials rarely swing seasons. But one could imagine that it could. Say the Cowboys are two wins away from the play-offs with only two games left in the regular season and one of their receivers catches a pass in the end zone, but the officials dont see it that way. They lose the game. But its just that little twinge of Darwinian luck that makes life interesting, especially in sports.Philadelphia probably would have done very well, challenged the Redskins even, if Randall Cunningham hadnt been injured in the first game of last season. And this year, the Eagles were again expected to rise to the occasion and be a contender, but life left one of their premier defensive linemen, Jerome Brown. They may still do extremely well. But their chances would be just a wee bit higher had Brown not.
been killed. And it is this same chance of error that gives some teams wins and some teams losses. The officials are often the form of that error. That error had left for a while, but now its back and I embrace it.Speaking of error, I looked back at my first week of predictions, which was on the second week of NFL action, and I found that I did quite well. Id chalk it up to chance and happenstance, but I think Id prefer to call it skill and a very analytic mind that led me to the choices I made. Of the first 14 games I made predictions for, I got 12 of them right. I guess that will happen more often as the season goes on, and I lose track of whats going on.As for this weeks predictions, however, well see. Take Buffalo over Miami. Denver over Kansas City in a tough game at Mile High Stadium. Tampa behind Coach Wyche over the hapless Colts.The Raiders are having quarterback problems. The Giants are having coaching trouble, and theyre getting old. Take the Giants anyway. Take the Jets over the Patriots. Neither San Diego or Seattle is playing well. Take the Chargers, they have more potential.Atlanta should beat an ailing Packers team. Chicago over division rival Minnesota (the Bears have got to pull one out for me eventually). Detroit in the Silverdome over New Orleans. San Francisco over the Rams at Candlestick. The Redskins shouldnt have a problem with the Cardinals.And tonights game is one of those uncertain games. The Rams are struggling early under new head coach Chuck Knox while the Chiefs are still adapting to the new year. Take the Chiefs at home, 24-20.Thats it for this week. Be sure to yell at an official this weekend, even if theyve made the right call.
PRINCIPLES of SOUND RETIREMENT INVESTING
IF YOU THOUGHT COLLEGE WAS EXPENSIVE, TRY PUTTING YOURSELF THROUGH RETIREMENT.
Think about supporting yourself for 
twenty-five, thirty years or longer 
in retirement. It might be the greatest 
financial test youll ever face. Fortunately, 
you have one valuable asset in your 
favor. Time.
Time to take advantage of tax-deferral. 
Time for your money to grow.
But starting early is key. Consider this: 
ifyou begin saving just $100 a month at 
age thirty, you can accumulate $192,539* 
by the time you reach age sixty-five.
Wait tenyears and youd need to set aside 
S2127 a month to reach the same goal.
At TIAA-CREF) we not only under
stand the value of starting early, we 
can help make it possiblewith flexible 
retirement and tax-deferred annuity 
plans, a diverse portfolio of investment 
choices, nd a record of personal

The Tartan men's soccer team ran its record to 'wc on the soason by rolling to a big H1v win over Franklin & Marshall on Saturday, as sophomore Alex Amezquita continued his hot shootingby tallying a pairofgoals. Fellow CMU sophomore Pat Lucignani scored the other goal to back junior Dave Shapiros shutout.The game started real slow because it was really wet, junior Min Chong said, but after about10 minutes, we started to just dominate them. It was really a domination. We played exactly how we wanted to play.Although F&M is a non-league opponent, the victory is an important one for possible playoff rankings, as F&M is an Eastern Region team like the Tartans.

Do you have roaches in your basement dorm room? Do you want to push buggy but not be Greek? Do you want to tell Dining Services to not be so chintzy with the sour cream on your taco supreme? If the answer to any of these questions is 'Yes, then maybe you should consider the one organization that addresses all of these issues.The Student Dormitory Council (SDC) is an organization of residents of Carnegie Mellons residence halls comprised of six standing committees  Properties, Programming, Public Relations, Food, Housing, and Films  and three Carnival committees  Booth, Buggy,
and Tent. Each of the six standing committees serves a specialized function in serving as a liaison between CMU students and administrative offices, while the three Carnival Committees enhance the quality of student involvement with Spring Carnival.
Properties CommitteeSDCs Properties Committee office is located in Hamerschlag House. This office oversees the use of all recreational equipment in the residence halls. The organization owns and maintains all of the televisions in residence halls as well as the pool tables and ping-pong tables in residence hall recreation rooms and microwave ovens in dormitory kitchens. The Properties Committee also keeps supporting equipment like pool cues,
pool balls, and ping-pong balls in stock and available for student use.
Programming CommitteeSDCs Programming Committee is involved with organizing and running recreational and educational activities for CMU students. SDC works in conjunction with resident assistants in University Housing to organize little things, like ice skating in Schenley or [hunting for] Easter eggs, said Matt Willard, sophomore materials science major and SDC vice president. Willard also mentioned SDCs larger endeavors like Sex Week, always a big thing, in January and the Homecoming Clip- pership Dance in October. The Programming Committee is interested in

Most students view CMUs student government as something that is just there: an entity without any real purpose. What a lot of students dont seem to understand is that without student government, the administration would run the students lives, and hell might seem like a fun place in comparison.The setup of student government, consisting of two parts, is pretty simplo. First, there are two governing bodies  Student Senate, including an executive branch, and the Graduate Student Organization (GSO).The executive branch of Student Senate has the offices of president, treasurer, and public relations officer. The legislative branch is made up of Student Senate chair, heads of the various committees, and Senators. It [the two- branch setup] is a version of checks and balances, says junior ECE major Greg Haverkamp, Rules Committee head. The president has veto power and the Senate can choose to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Hence, no one branch can get resolutions passed without answering to the other.Senior IM major Matthew McGarvey serves as Student Senate chair this year and describes his duties as, running the meetings of Senate.... I do most of the administrative work.Natalie Gesmond, a senior political science and psychology major and president of student government, said, Traditionally, the president was just someone who got a budget and went off and did his/her own thing  without any real relationship to the legislative branch. Gesmond now wishes to change that by working with the legislative branch instead of separate from it. She is also trying to depoliticize the
process by which action occurs by hear- ; ing students concerns and getting those concerns passed on to the ad- ! ministration. Working with her is senior math/CS major Jay Laefer, trea- ' surer, and senior English major Bob Dixon, public relations officer. Laefer jteeps track of finances for student , government and also works closely with the Funding and Recognition Committee in the legislative branch. Dixon publicizes student government events.The legislative branch, or Senate, helps givo the students somo power over what happens within their onvi- ronmentby makingrocoinmondations to the University administration, and, more importantly, distributing the Student Activitos Feo which every student pays each semester.Senate doesnt have much power except for controlling the purse strings, says CS doctoral student Erik Altmann, head of the Campus Affairs Committee. Activities Fee money is used to fund various student activities and student groups.For other issues not directly connected to the use of the Activities Fee, Senate can make suggestions but it is up to the administration to actually implement them  Senate has no tangible power in this area. Handling the money is no small task; as Altmann said, A half-million bucks gives students a bit of power over their environment. Not only is that a good experience, its a good thing [to have and use that power].The legislature has many committees that are used to make resolutions to pass on to the University administration, which actually implements (or doesnt implement) the plans.A good example would be the bike racks we are accustomed to having all over campus.

Office of Admission does more than read essays
By BOBBIE DOFFLEMYER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
All students at Carnegie Mellon deal with one administrative j department or another, but the one we all have in common is the Office of Admission. All of us at j CMU have gone through the ad- mission process, and, as explained jby Associate Director Michael i White, it is not a quick and easy 
thing.
Five stages mark the road to CMU. The first and most difficult to negotiate is the pre-inquiry stage. White sa3's, We do not

are on the search for CMU hopefuls. Our biggest strategy is direct mail that points to the students specific interests, says White. White adds that personal
contact is the key to the entire admission process: We want them to contact staff and current CMU students to find out about the benefits CMU offers. To keep the students interested in CMU, the Office of Admission sends them all kinds of literature that asks them to do something, whether it is to return a card, call, or visit the campus. It is very imporant to get them on campus, says White, emphasizing the influence of actually seeing, rather than just hearing, what the University offers. The admission counselors encourage
interviewing and touringthe campus, as well as attending one of the three Sleeping Bag Weekends provided for inquiries.Around 60 regional programs about the University and over 50 hometown interviews comprise a major outreach recruiting program. We cover every comer of the country, as far west as Seattle and San Diego, and as far east as Maine and Miami. It is in this stage that students, as White says, turn into hard-core applicants.In the applicant stage, about

Govt handles 
students power
SENATE, from page LI
Committee badgered the administration until they got the newer bike racks in place. The Rules Committee, headed by Haverkamp, is busy rewriting the constitution bylaws. We are trying to strengthen the government by rewriting the bylaws... making them more cohesive, he says. The Funding and Recognition Committee, headed by GSIA student Michael Loomis, reviews funding requests before the requests go before the full Senate.The Academic Affairs Committee, headed by senior biology major Mike Tomblyn, deals with academic affairs for the students, rather than letting the administration do everything without getting input from the student body.GSO is separate from Student Senate, but serves a similar purpose. GSO receives 33 percent of the Activities Fees contributed by graduate students, and distributes that money among graduate departments for departmental events, other graduate student organizations, and capital expenditures which support the graduate student community, such as the new GSO Coffeehouse. GSO also retains a portion of the money for sponsoring its own events.According to Treasurer Howard Read, a doctoral ECE student, GSO started out more as a place to receive funding, but is becoming more and more politically representative of graduate students needs. Groups which are currently funded by GSO include the Black Graduate Student Organization, and Women in Non-Traditional Graduate Studies (WINGS).Each department sends representatives to GSO depending on the number of graduates students in the department. These are the voting members of GSO.GSO and Senate each have representatives in the other organization, but the committees, rules, and policies remain separate. However, Read says that, Were currently working with the Senate Funding and Recognition Committee to align our policies to a certain extent.Student government is a bureaucracy, in every sense of the word. However, that is not always a bad thing  it exists for the purpose of making sure that students get a say in what goes on around them.
SDC works for resident issues
SDC, from page LIbecoming involved with larger activities in the residence halls; residents of the West Wing went on a white water rafting trip which the SDC helped to fund, .buffering the cost for students. Were looking to help out with more of these, Willard said.
Public RelationsEvents like ice skating in Schenley Park and Sex Week are advertised by the organizations Public Relations Committee, which handles all poster advertising for activities as well as for Saturday Films run by the SDC Films Committee.
Food Committee -----------------------------The SDCs committees | impact campus life beyond providing activities and fa- ' cilities. The Food and Housing Committees are the most influential on campus, Willard said. The Food Committee meets weekly with dining service V representatives who take suggestions on changes and try to effect them. Dining  ^, Services, Willard said, is ^ the administrative structure on campus most likely to change. Willard also said that the SDC Food Committee was consulted on the changes in meal plans that took effect this year; SDC was also given copies of all materials sent to students about the new meal plan systems.
Housing CommitteeThe Housing Committee deals with the residence halls in general. The big one [issue] has been [the time] when the garbage men come, Willard said. There has been a lot of discussion with Housing concerning its contract with the I trash removal company. The Housing Committee also had extensive discussions with Academic Computing and Media when the Mudge Computer | Cluster was closed, a move which made many
students unhappy. Its a way students can voice opinions to different administrations, said Willard.Aside from its standing committees, SDC also has three Spring Carnival Committees: Booth, Buggy, and Tent.
Booth and Buggy Committees The Booth and Buggy Committees are for students who want to be active [in Carnival] but havent joined other organizations; its a great opportunity to get involved said Willard, citing very successful past Booth and Buggy teams. Anyone living in University Housing has the opportunity to participate in the Carnival Committees.
------------------------------------Tent CommitteeThe Carnival Tent Committee makes the contracts with many of the performers in tihe main tent as well as the tent itself. Most of the SDCs tent budget goes toward supplying the main Spring Carnival tent.
Membership Every student living in University Housing
"Committees are where a 
lot of the fun is; you can 
see the product when 
youre done.
r Matt Willard, 
SDC Vice President
is already a non-voting member of the Student Dormitory Council and welcome to attend both general and committee meetings. To become a voting member of the SDC, a student must turn in, at a SDC meeting, a petition form with 25 signatures, of students living in University Housing, usually from people living on the same floor. To become a committee member after obtaining voting privileges, a student merely needs to contact the committee chair. Said Willard, Committees are where a lot of the fun is; you can see the product when youre done.Everyone [in SDC] is always looking for new people with new ideas, Willard said. If you want to get involved on campus and make a difference, SDC is a great way of doing it.
Admission recruits 
applicants, freshmen
ADMISSION, from page LI8.200 students apply for admission to CMU. The University accepts about 62 percent of the total applicants, and of these, between 1,150 and1.200 are enrolled. About 59 percent of those enrolled come from the mid-Eastern states, but in general, Carnegie Mellon applicants cover a broad geographic range. Personal contact is still a continuing factor in the process as students and admission counselors take care of any last- minute details regarding academic departments and financial aid procedures.The fourth segment of this process involves the admitted group. Carnegie Mellon admits by colleges. In some departments, the admittance rate is tighter than others because of space availability, says White. Colleges usually look for students in the top ten percent of their high school classes. Standardized test scores figure into the equation as well: most colleges prefer students who have an average SAT score of 550 verbal and 650 math. These test scores, however, depend on the college and major the student plans to enter, and they do not weigh as heavily as the students high school record and grades.Specific colleges have different requirements. MCS and CIT look for an overall strong high school record of courses and grades with a heavy emphasis on math and science. H&SS and IM also look for a strong overall profile, but with less emphasis on math and science. CFA is the only college that accepts students based on a departmental review of talent, coupled with an academic review by admissions, according to the admission literature. The largest,college is CIT,
followed by MCS and CFA.The final stage involves the depositor. The Office of Admission continues to maintain student interest in CMU over the summer by giving them information from The Word and allowing students to submit AP credits. We do not want anyone changing their minds at the last minute, says White, and this is why the strategy of personal contact is so crucial in getting and keeping student interest.Transfer students and foreign national students go through a similar admissions process as far as the kinds of courses taken, grades achieved, and tests taken. The only difference for foreign national students is the required Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Admission relies heavily on the TOEFL, looking for scores over 600, to determine the students command of the English language both written and spoken.Transfer student's have a harder time being accepted because of the lack of available space. According to White, This is affected by the number of freshman enrolled. We try to keep the numbers close to what the faculty can handle.... This calls for tighter competition between transfer students. We do look at their high school records to see if they would have been accepted as freshmen if they would have applied then.The long, involved admission procedure is a way of determining which students can be successful at CMU, and then making sure they get here. The Office of Admission looks for the students with the highest potential for success in the University, as an individual, and in the job market.

President Mehrabian discusses new projects
ments and additions to several buildings on campus and has several new ones in the planning stage. Every year for the past several years, the administration has spent $200,000 upgrading classrooms, and this past summer, spent $2 million to renovate some of the fraternities. The latest addition  to the Graduate School of Industrial Administration  will be complete on time (Dec. 1992) and on budget ($13.7 million), according to Mehrabian, and teaching there will start promptly next semester. Its not just an extension of the business school, but also provides facilities for our students in the undergraduate Industrial Management program, says Mehrabian. For the first time in a very long time, all undergraduate Industrial Management main core courses will be taught by tenured faculty in the business school.The Electronic Materials Technology Building, to be built behind Hamerschlag Hall and scaled down the hill, will be four or five stories tall and connect to the existing building. We have $10.5 of $15 million and have authorized architectural planning and design of the building, says Mehrabian. Well raise the rest of the funds this year and hope to start construction sometime next summer.

ate do graduate, says Mehrabian. We have to do a much better job of student advising and strengthen our tutorial program. All in all, Mehrabian says, Im very happy with the 19  on the other hand, I cant say that thats where Id like to be. I want to be much higher than that.And among all these endeavors, Mehrabian still finds time to have fun. His favorites? Freshman Orientation  I had a good time getting up and talking to parents. Another time is Carnival.... Its a time when the campus comes alive.And in his free time? Theres not a whole lot of free time, he says. If I have time, Ill ride a horse.... My wife has horses....

Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Since 1990, when he was inaugurated as Carnegie Mellons seventh president, Robert Mehrabian has been involved in much change on campus. Under his administration, several dormitory and academic buildings have been renovated, the long- neglected niche project on the College of Fine Arts building is finally being completed, the GSIA addition is almost finished, and the Carnegie Mellon Centre 
de Tours program in Tours, France, is in full swing.Since his graduation from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1960, Mehrabian has earned his bachelors and PhD in metallurgy and material sciences from MIT and has held professorships at MIT, University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, and the University of California at San-ta Barbara.He has published more than 140 technical papers, has edited six books, and holds eight patents. He doesnt seem to be slowing down any since his tenure began on July 1, 1990, either. Academically, structurally, culturally, and extra-curricularly, Mehrabian has made many improvements to CMU.He has made available opportunities for faculty and students in all disciplines. He created the position of Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, presently held by Erwin Steinberg, who was the first dean of H&SS.He created 34 advisory boards, each chaired by a member of the Board of Trustees and includ- ing experts from around the country and around the world. I wanted to have some outside advice on how well we were doing, says Mehrabian. These advisory boards, which meet every two years, each examine a specific aspect of the University, such as computing, athletics, or an academic department, and evaluate it, making suggestions for improvement.He initiated the Centre de 
Tours program in Tours, France, where students spend a semester living with a French family and going to school there. He also worked closely with former Student Government President Kishor Rao (M/CS, 92) to enact the Fifth Year Scholars program, in which five to ten students are selected each year to spend a fifth year on campus, tuition free, to sample courses outside the department their majors were in. I wanted to do something to recognize undergraduates who had tremendous achievements in their careers here, says Mehrabian. He approved $50,000 in funding for undergraduate research grants, and says, I feel strongly that undergraduates should be involved in research.Structurally, Mehrabian has funded and supported improveIts very important that you have 
an awareness of cultures.... I feel 
very strongly we should introduce 
a sequence of experiences for our 
undergraduate and training pro
grams that address the issue of 
internationalization. 
r President Mehrabian
The Performing Arts Center, which has been promised to the College of Fine Arts for some 30 years, is still being planned. When I came, that building was slated to be approximately $12 million.... The most recent cost estimate was $18 million, says Mehrabian. We have approximately $5 million already.... Were working on one major donor, whom we want to name the building after, and if we get that donor, well move on that building very quickly.Regarding the University Center, Mehrabian says, The highest priority right now in my plans is the University Center. The architectural designs were finished three months ago, and $10 million of the building's $41 million dollar cost has been raised. We have one primary donor that were hoping will donate half the cost, says Mehrabian. I expect to find out about that one way or another very soon. If we get that primary donor to commit, Im going to take a chance [that I can raise the last $10 million] and start building.To improve cultural relations on campus, Mehrabian has instituted and improved many international aspects of our campus community. It is my strong be
lief that when you graduate and go into the work force... its going to require not just for you to have the ability to solve problems and the ability to have continuing education capabilitiesits very important that you have an awareness of cultures, hopefully some foreign language experience.... I feel very strongly we should introduce a sequence of experiences for our undergraduate and training programs that address the issue of internationalization.CMU has increased the number of agreements for exchange programs it has with other universities in different countries. The number of courses available for language students has been greatly increased, and by next fall, the Modern Languages Departments budget will have tripled. The Task Force on Cultural Diversity has also prepared two minicourses being offered this semester  Introduction to Cultural Analysis and Asian- American Cultures.When I came, CMAP didnt have a base budget. We immediately gave them $250,000 as an annual base budget and have increased that ever since. A $15,000 allocation has also been added to the budget of the Associate Provost for Academic Projects to support the Committee on Mi- norities and Women in Science and Engineering. Mehrabian also introduced an international office and expanded the Office of International Education. We also started International Week. I felt that we needed something akin to

President Mehrabian speaks with football Head Coach Rich Lackner and several players in Highlander Caf.
U.S. News and World Report's Top 25 Colleges and Universities list.Among the factors Mehrabian lists as contributing to this rise in standing are the resource additions made to instructional activities and the aggressive recruiting efforts made by the Office of Admission. Our applications have gone up about 32 percent in two years, says Mehrabian. One area where Mehrabian is disappointed with our ratingis student satisfaction, measured by the percent of entering freshmen who graduate after 5 years. (CMUs is about 70 percent). I think Steinberg has put it very accuratelyour function here is to make sure that those students thatshould gradutheyre very safe and sound, I get on them. I read a lot of time management books, and autobiographies  Im just working my way through Truman now. I also read some spy novels that these guys [Steinberg and Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy] sneak to mo.On a more serious note, ho says, I think that... the foundation of this Universityhow it started, and our motto ofMy heart is in the work has carried us through the last 92 yearB.I just have a very strong feeling and devotion to preserving that heritage. Institutions like ours are precious  they are really the jewels left in our country.
Spring Carnival, says Mehrabian. This year well have our International Festival concentrate on Latin America and the Caribbean  well have dances, music, food, costume, poetry, lectures and movies.Mehrabian has also made many improvements in campus extracurricular life. He helped with the Graduate Student Coffeehouse in Skibo so that graduate and commuter students could have a place to relax, socialize, and study during the academic day. He also approved funding for the extension of the womens soccer program, as well as its move to varsity status. He provided support and funding for the Last Lecture Series, Gathering Storr, Take 30, Student Affairs Leadership Series, and special class projects. In addition, hes approved funding for several special initiatives, such as Greek leadership retreats, Black History Month, and Kiltie Band jafck- ets.One of the fruits of Mehrab- ians efforts is CMUs recent jump from 24th to 19th in this year's

Recycled Productions raves CFA on Friday
By MARNI BOREK
Tartan Co-Magazine Editor
Lets finally face the dismal factsdisco and top 40 club days 
4re gone. To replace these days are the raves  industrial and techno music trips onto a dance floor lit by psychedelic lights, surrounded by projected images, and enveloped by megawatts of sound you never thought todays technology would allow for.You can find raves these days in all the major cities  New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and believe it or not... Pittsburgh. And to continue this tradition a group called Recycled Productions has decided to put
Mini Music
Sa5Col
nine Inch Hails
After nearly three years, Trent Reznor, the man behind popular industrial group Nine Inch Nails has returned to the music scene. Though Reznors fans have been thrown a bone here and there in the form of songs hes remixed for other bands, and his appearance 
on Gub, the album from the industrial supergroup Pigface, its really the return of NIN that has been sorely awaited. Well, wait no. longer, because a new EP, bro
ken, has just been released.In some ways, broken is a very big disappointment. After such a long hiatus for NIN in the studio, one expects more of an effort than 33 minutes of music, though that S3 minutes is very satisfying.; The EP starts off slow, with the instrumental pinion feeding the listener with some heavily distorted guitar riffs, but quicldy picks up speed with wish, a pounding, screaming song that reaches right into the ear and pulls out the brain in a quivering pulpy mass. Or at least thats what it seemed like to me. The j-est of the EP continues in the Same vein, with three more songs hnd an instrumental rounding out the time.Reznors lyrics continue in the sqmo vein as those from his immensely successful Pretty Hate 
Machine, bemoaning the loss of loVe (and the fact that he got Screwed by his old record label) in his well-known plaintive whine though that whine is much more of a guttural scream this time around.
; Though it is not obvious at all from the packaging and track listing, there are two more songs on the EP, hidden in various ways. The version of the CD that I have includes a CD-3 with the two extra tracks. Another version of the CD simply has 99 tracks, of which Only the first six and the last two Actually have music. The cassette release has an entire side that seems blank, but has the two songs hidden somewhere near the end. These two bonus tracks seem to me to have been tacked on so that the EP is not as short &s it seems at first.However, it was a pretty good idea, since one of the extra tracks is; a NIN-ian cover of the Adam Ant song Physical (Youre too), and Trents own version of Suck, the song he co-wrote and sang for Pigface. If youre familiar with Pigface and have heard that version of Suck, youre in for a \irprise, as Trent has done Strange things to the tune.1 ;Its obvious to me that Reznor hfis been spending a lot of the last iefw years hanging out with A1 J<)urgenson of Ministry. The hpavy, almost metallic, guitars of 
broken practically scream out Ministry on their own, but when combined with grungier song production and intense distortion of Rfeznors singing voice, its even hlore apparent. If broken was to b0 compared to Ministry albums, it; would fall somewhere between 
The Land of Rape and Honey and
on a rave right on the CMU campus in the CFA foyer this coming Friday from 10 pm to 4 am.With the great music, the popular DJs, and the phenomenal acoustics in the foyer, the party is bound to be happening.Five DJs will be spinning this Friday night. First theres WRCTs own Techno Terrorists who will be playing the mainstream techno that many of us have become familiar with over the past year with the popularity of such songs as LA Styles James Brown is Dead.WRCTs Simon and DJ Guile will also be spinning techno, but with a slightly harder beat.A D J from Pitt radio, dieselBoy,
the somewhat more metallic The 
Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste.My main problems with this disc are its length, and its packaging. The CD comes packaged in the allegedly more ecologically sound eco-pak, which was intended to replace the longbox. Of course, the eco-pak is then packaged inside a longbox, thereby using up about twice the amount of cardboard as either type of packaging would alone.This EP is definitely worth picking up, unless you are a NIN fan who does not also appreciate harder industrial, like Ministry. If so, listen to somebody elses copy of the disc before getting it. Otherwise, go out and pick it up soon  but dont pay exorbitant prices for it. (i.e., dont get it at Oasis Records in Oakland. They charge too much.) Brendan McFeely
SWEET OBLIVION
Screaming Trees
Screaming Trees is one band that has  and I say this with all sincerity  earned its flannel. Longtime forgotten sons of the Seattle scene, they have finally come into their own with their latest effort, Sweet. Oblivion.From the first, this album brings to mind images of large men in lumberjack attire swinging axes behind some little wood shack on the edge of a huge forest under a dull iron-gray sky. Not the cheeriest of ways to spend your time, but definitely worthwhile. The bass pulsates and resounds, the guitar grinds with a metallic sound, the drums bang and beat more than pound, and the vocals are gritty and seductive. In short, this album is more the essence ofthe Northwest than just Seattle  the sound is less
will be spinning the break beats, which is techno with very fast beats that start up and cut off abruptly to produce a funky fluttering rhythm.D J dieselBoy has worked at local raves like the ones thrown at Metropol and also has his own line of rave clothing which can be described as hip hoppish-skate- boarder fashion. (This type of clothing first started making waves in LA.)Last, but surely not forgotten is Dr. Suess who will be spinning at Metropol every Sunday night when the club introduces raves for all ages. He helped organize this past summers Gatorave at Metropol as well. Hell get the
urban, refined, and calculatingly grungy. Its man against the wilderness, camp fires that you need to keep warm, and, well, flannel  at its most utilitarian.
Sweet Oblivion opens up with the dark Shadow of the Season, and moves on to Nearly Lost You, a cool, hummable track which also shows up on the 
Singles soundtrack. For most of the album, Mark Lanegans vocals soar over the rhythmic strumming of the other instruments, sweeping strongmelodies and harmonies into the mix. On a few songs, most notably For Celebrations Past, (a CD bonus track) the effect is almost that of a combination of The Doors and Soundgarden, with a dash oftree bark thrown in for good measure. The Secret Kind is a head- banger of the highest order, and Winter Song is the kind of song that you can listen to 20 times in a row if youre in the right kind of self-contemplative mood. The band really goesoffanddoes some cool stuff on Julie Paradise, the last track (which unfortunately cuts off in the middle if you dub the CD onto one side of a 90- minute tape).This album sounds old and new, reminds me of winters in Little 
House on the Prairie books without any of the hot cocoa from Ma. But it somehow escapes being completely desolate. I cant call it hope, but theres some sort of undercurrent of good in the music. Maybe its the vastness of the vocals or maybe its something else. But it must be something, because right now Im listening to it for the fifth time since I got it this morning. Megan Dietz

Tomorrow night Metropol will rock with the hard-hitting sounds of Helmet and Faith No More. This double-ear-plug show promises to be Pittsburghs indoor rock n roll event of the year.New York Citys Helmet, the opening act, is called The Next Nirvana by music industry bigwigs, but thats a load. Helmets structured, discordant, teeth-grinding sound has more in common with a car factory than Nirvana. This bandmay ormaynotbedestinedfor commercial greatness, but that really isnt the point. The point is the music, and Meantime (their major label debut after an industry-wide courtship that landed them a million-dollar contract with Interscope) kicks hard but clean. These guys play fairfrom their boarding-school haircuts to their honest, though complex, song constructions to their refreshing lack of schtick. Helmet is definitely a band to check out, but be warned  they play REALLY loud.Faith No More is a brilliant band who absolutely rules the roost of rock n roll (or at least they come close). Im not kidding. This group is undoubtedly among the best the world has to offer.You might remember these guys from 1989s
The Real Thing  the track Epic got a lot of radio airplay and was all over MTV for the entire summer of 1990 (you know, the video with the flopping goldfish). This summer, Faith No More struck again with Angel Dust, an incredible-to- the-point-of-peerlessness trip through lands that might be nice to visit, but.... Even the cover art is unsettling  one side has a beautiful snowy white bird against a midnight blue sky, but the other side has a cows head hanging in a meat locker. The band works in contrasts  hard and soft, angry and smart, beautiful and terrible.Faith No More has existed in one form or another since 1982. Its members have often fallen prey to the angry-young-man stereotype, but they are more mature and aware than that. Sure, they mean what they say  you can tell that much from the intensity with which they say it but they also have their tongues somewhere near their cheeks throughout the whole process. RV, a track from Angel Dust, is a prime example  Backside melts into the sofa/ My world, my TV, andmyfood/Besides listeningto my belly gurgle/ Aint much else to do.Fresh from opening for the Guns N Roses/ Metallica stadium tour this summer, Faith No More should be ready to get down and get off in a bit of a smaller venue tomorrow night. This incredible two-for-the-price-of-one deal should not be missed.SPORTS!SPORTS!SPORTS!

Hearts of Darkness is a documentary, which 
details the filming of Francis Ford Coppolas Apoca
lypse Now.
Apocalypse Now was filmed in the jungles of the 
Philippines, which stood in for the jungles of Viet
nam. Director Francis Ford Coppola had many 
difficulties during the filming
One of his stars, Martin Sheen, had a heart 
attack on location. Coppola also had no inkling 
about how the film would end. The film went over 
budget; plus there was a revolution while they were 
on location.
If you liked Apocalypse Now or Heart ofDarkness 
by Joseph Conrad (the book that Apocalypse Now 
was based on), you might want to check this film 
out. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at location 
filming.
At 6, 8,10 pm.

Robert Altmans The Player is an oddity in Holly
wood. As a film that satirizes, lampoons, and gener
ally rips to shreds the popular idea of how movies 
get made, its surprising that The Player ever got 
made.
Tim Robbins (now seen in Bob Roberts) plays a 
greedy, sadistic, arrogant studio executive who ac
cidentally murders a screenwriter and then spends 
the rest of the movie trying to cover up the incident.
Co-star Greta Scacchi plays the beautiful live-in 
girlfriend of the dead screenwriter, who is romanced 
and stolen away by Robbins.
The real fun of this movie comes with the many, 
many cameo appearances by actors, actresses, and 
directors sending themselves up.
Fun cameos include Anjelica Huston, Nick Nolte, 
Bruce Willis, and Julia Roberts. Also watch out for 
Whoopi Goldberg as a sly cop from Pasadena.
All in all, when you combine the fun of the cameos 
with the cutting satire of the script, you get a movie 
that is not only worth the buck, its worth the full 
price you wouldve had to pay in a real theater.
At 5, 7:15, 9:30 pm, midnight.

Fried Green Tomatoes, starring Jessica Tandy 
and Kathy Bates, Mary-Louise Parker, and Mary 
Stuart Masterson, charms the movie-goer just as 
Ninny (Tandy) enthralls Evelyn (Bates) with tales 
from the 1940s deep south.
Idyllic flashbacks to rustic Alabama are soon 
tainted with tragic childhood death. Soon after, a 
heart-rending emotional bond begins to form be
tween Ruth (Parker) and Idgie (Masterson).
Before all is said and done, they will go to long 
lengths to stay together and keep each other from 
harm, including kidnapping and murder.
A good mix of tenderness and humor give this 
movie depth without sappiness. Hopeless roman
tics must see this film.
At 7, 9:30 pm, midnight.

Gimme Shelteris another documentary-style film. 
Starring the Rolling Stones, Jefferson Airplane, 
and Melvin Belli, it documents the Rolling Stones 
and their free concert at Altamont Speedway.
For those of you who dont know, the concert at 
Altamont Speedway resulted in chaos and murder. 
Directors David Maysles, Albert Maysles, and Char
lotte Zwerin capture the events at Altamont in a 
chilling fashion.
The Rolling Stones perform some of their best 
songs: Satisfaction, Sympathy for the Devil, 
Brown Sugar, and Under My Thumb.
Get your share of sex, drugs, and rock n roll with 
a little bit of murder and mayhem thrown in for 
good measure.

Mr. Saturday Nights l5m uee eun8t,
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Forum Editor
Billy Crystals latest movie, Mr. Satur
day Night, is about an aging comic named Buddy Young, Jr. who wants to get back onto the stage and reclaim the glory of his youth. Crystal co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film, which is not a comedy  dont go expecting to laugh.The movie has Buddy in the present, as an elderly man whose comic efforts are collapsing around him. The first half of the movie has a flash card effect to it, jumping back to Buddy and his family and friends in the 40s and 50s, then forward to these same people as they appear now. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Buddy is the one character who remains the same, and that he is the root of all of everyones (including his own) problems. Unfortunately, the set-up of this takes far too long  and there is no plot or story obviously being established. As such, it is very hard to sit through the first hour.In the second half, the pieces that have been dumped in the viewers lap suddenly start to make sense. Buddys relationship with his wife, brother, and daughter all become clear, and suddenly very touching. The story flows along very smoothly and very well from this point on, with the only good humor occurring in the last hour. The only happy times in the movie also occur in the final hour but are offset by a number of bad times. Luckily, the movie does end on a happy note, which wraps it up without being weepy or clich6d.
Mr. Saturday Night is not really a movie about a comicits a movie about relationships. Buddys relation to his family is bad, but its nothing compared to his relations with everyone else. Buddy is a overbearing, bitingly sarcastic old man who has been overbearing and bitingly sarcastic all his

resolve rivalries in Crystals directorial debut, Mr. Saturday Night.
life. His personality made him a hit on the stage but a failure in his personal life, and the movies main focus is on his attempts to fix this.Buddys brother, Stan Yankelman, is played by David Paymer. Stan is Buddys manager, and has been with Buddy for the last fifty years. Theirs is the most complex relationship in the film, with barely concealed fraternal competition (and eventually brought out in cruel ways) throughout the film.Mary Mara (The Hard Way) plays Buddys estranged-since-childhood daughter, Susan, a former drug addict who is slowly gotting her life together. Unlike Stan, Susan and Buddys difficulties are presented in bas-relief they fight bitterly every time they are together. The situation is made worse because it is obvious to the viewer that they both regret everything that has brought them to this point, but neither can successfully make the first step to bring them back together.
Mr. Saturday Night is Crystals director rial debut (Crystal already having starred in the comedy City Slickers), and its a great; start. Crystal knows the character of Buddy Young, Jr. very well, having created him in 1984 and been developing him ever since. This intimate knowledge of the character certainly contributes to the smoothness of the entire movie. Also, the sense of time works very well  all of the flashbacks to the 40s and 50s arc excellent, with the right cars, clothes, furniture, haircut^/ and so on; the presentation is superb.I can wholeheartedly rocommond thlK' films acting, scenery, and boliovabilitiy.' But what I cant got by is the prosontati'oiv of the first half of the movie. All of tl'io information is necessary, but its far too slow. The viewer needs too much patience for the seven bucks that they paid too M6 it. But if you can make it through the firHi, half, this is a wonderful and touching mov|fi
