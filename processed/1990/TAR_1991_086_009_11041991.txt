GSIA construction continues
CIT curriculum revised
By LESLIE ZUBATY
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology recently intro
duced a new undergraduate engi
neering curriculum. The new pro
gram promotes cross-disciplinary 
study while maintaining its empha
sis on scientific knowledge. Dean of 
CIT Stephen W. Director said of the 
change, I think its a very exciting 
curriculum, and I believe that the 
change renews CMUs leadership in 
the field.
The new curriculum consists of 
two major changes. CIT has created 
introductory engineering courses for 
each semester this year, for all en
tering freshmen in all engineering
departments. Director feels that 
these introductory courses will give 
students a great opportunity to ex
plore different fields before making 
any quick decisions about a major 
and that this will be especially help
ful for students who have never been 
exposed to the study of engineering 
in high school.
The second change incorporates 
newly-created designated engineer
ing minors, designed to compliment 
present disciplinary minors. The new 
minors include: biomedical engineer
ing, environmental engineering, 
manufacturing engineering, and 
engineering design. Faculty mem
bers hope that these new programs 
will even better prepare students to

THIS JUST IN.,._____________
Europe scrambles for Mideast arms deals
WASHINGTON, No v.l, (DJ)While 
the U.S. plays peacemaker in the Middle 
East, France and Britain are scram
bling to sign large new arms deals 
throughout the region.
The Bush administration, eager to 
promote the peace conference that be
gan this week in Madrid and seeking to 
prod Persian Gulf states to carry out 
internal political changes, has sus
pended virtually all arms sales to the 
Arab world. But France and Britain, 
whose defense companies are much 
more dependent on foreign orders than 
their U.S. counterparts, are showing 
no such restraint. Instead, senior gov
ernment and industry officials from 
both countries have stepped up mar
keting efforts substantially.
They can claim significant successes.
British Aerospace PLC, for instance, 
is close to landingwhat could be atleast 
a $5 billion deal to sell the Saudis 48 
Tornado jet fighters, 60 Hawk trainer 
aircraft and other equipment. Just a 
few months ago, Saudi and U.S. offi
cials confidently predicted that busi
ness would go primarily to U.S. suppli
ers, but since then, Saudi leaders pri
vately have expressed uncertainty 
about the U.S. governments willing
ness to support arms transactions with 
Arab states.
French companies, meanwhile, are 
pushing hard to snare a big chunk of 
the nearly $5 billion Kuwait has ear
marked to beef up its military over the 
next few years. France also is close to a 
preliminary agreement to supply hun
dreds of its top-of-the-line Leclerc tanks 
to the United Arab Emirates, industry 
and Pentagon officials say. In October, 
French Defense Minister Pierre Joxe 
signed a sweepingmilitary-cooperation 
agreement with the UAE that is be
lieved to permit the first field tests ever 
of the next-generation French tanks in 
that country.
The Europeans are seeking Middle 
Eastern sales more aggressively than 
ever, says Eichard Grimmett, who 
studies the issue for the Congressional
Research Service. Competition and 
market forces are likely to be more 
important than political pressure from 
the U.S. in shaping future arms trans
actions, he asserts.
The volume of U.S. sales we saw in 
the region during the 1970s and 1980s 
just isnt going to reoccur, frets Brian 
Polcari, a top executive of a Washing
ton-based company that provides hous
ing and other services for employees of 
U.S. weapons-makers in Saudi Arabia.
The appetite in Arab countries for 
sophisticated Western arms increased 
substantially after Iraqs invasion of 
Kuwait last year. Initially, that was 
encouraged by the U.S. administration 
officials, who havent talked publicly 
about their change of heart, but pri
vately they confirm that Secretary of 
State James Baker and others in Bushs 
inner circle worry that arms sales would 
complicate peace efforts.
The unilateral U.S. embargo on arms 
sales wont change until the public sees 
demonstratable evidence that foreign
competitors are rolling up major sales 
at our expense, says retired Army Gen. 
Howard Fish, chairman of the Ameri
can League For Exports and Security 
Assistance, which represents the larg
est U.S. defense companies.
When the shooting stopped in the 
Persian Gulf, few expected the U.S. 
would be the underdog in the Middle 
East arms arena. U.S. business and 
government leaders anticipated unprec
edented influence and a steady stream 
of contracts throughout the MiddleEast. 
There was talk of well over $20 billion 
in immediate military business from 
the Saudis alone. And Defense Secre
tary Dick Cheney and his aides pre
dicted that the U.S. would work closely 
with Arab governments to encourage 
sweepingintemal reforms, while buildingup andtrainingtheirmilitaiyforces.
The Pentagon also had hopes of leav
ing behind in Saudi Arabia enough 
tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and 
other equipment and ammunition to 
supply an entire U.S. armored division
incase of another crisis. With Arab and 
American forces sharing the same 
equipment and tactics, U.S. officials 
believed, it was only a matter of time 
before the U.S. share of the regions 
arms market would increase.
But now, those plans have been 
dashed. Saudi leaders, seeking to shore 
up domestic support among fundamentalist religious groups, have balked at 
signing the so-called pre-position" 
agreements. As a result, nearly all op, 
the U.S. hardware is headed back to I 
Europe or the U.S.
Expanded training exercises with 
Saudi units, access to airfields and 
ports, and other joint military efforts 
also have been put on hold.
The Saudis are not being very help, f 
ful right now, House Armed Services' 
Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D 
Wis.) told reporters recently. The no
tion of a cohesive alliance between the 
U.S. and the kingdoms in the Persian1 
Gulf, he acknowledged, probably was 
hopeless from the beginning.
Israel attacks Lebanonbased Iranian guerrillas
BEIRUT, Nov. 1, (AP)  Two Israeli jets blasted Iranian-backed 
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on Friday as Israeli gunners kept 
up a bombardment of Shiite Muslim villages for a third day, 
Lebanese police said.
Police said the air raid was aimed at bases around the southern 
village of Habboush, a stronghold of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or 
Party of God.
There was no immediate report of casualties from the air attack 
near the village, which is about 15 kilometers north of Israels selfstyled security zone in south Lebanon.
The raid was the third this week and followed two separate Israeli 
strikes against Hezbollah bases on Tuesday to avenge the killing of 
three Israeli soldiers in a roadside bombing.
Shiite Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollahs Islamic Resistance and 
Sunni Muslim fundamentalists of the Islamic Jihad Movement in 
Palestine claimed responsibility for two separate attacks Tuesday, 
on the eve of the Madrid conference, in which three Israeli soldiers 
were killed and 11 wounded.
Bush calls for embargo
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29, (AP)  President Bush issued an order 
on Tuesday prohibiting virtually all U.S. commercial transactions 
with Haiti as a means of pressuring that countrys military rulers 
to restore democracy.
The order, issued in Madrid where Bush is attending the opening 
of the Middle East peace conference, is consistent with an October 
8 Organization of American States resolution calling for a hemi
sphere-wide embargo against Haiti.
The embargo does not apply to certain forms of humanitarian aid.
The OAS, with U.S. support, is demanding the restoration of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of Haiti. Aristide was deposed 
on September 30.
Bush exercised authority granted him under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act. His order will take effect on 
November 5.
Iraq claims evidence of U.S. war crimes
NICOSIA, Cyprus, Oct. 29, 
(AP)  Tuesday Iraq found 
the bodies of 44 soldiers who 
were buried alive by U.S. forces 
along the Saudi-Iraqi border 
during the Persian Gulf War, 
Iraqs state-run news agency 
said.
The Iraqi News Agency said 
the bodies were found in two 
mass graves in an area where
American troops crossed the 
border, crushing bunkers with 
tanks.
A pathologist determined the 
Iraqis died of suffocation, the 
agency said.
Foreign Minister Ahmed 
Hussein sent a letter to the Arab 
League secretary general, Ismat 
Abdul-Majeed, to inform him of 
this ugly crime by the American
forces, the report monitored in 
Nicosia said.
The foreign minister de
manded a U.N. investigation, 
the agency said.
Last month, reports in several 
U.S. newspapers quoted Ameri
can army officers as saying that 
Ml-Al tanks from the Armys 
First Infantry Division overran 
Iraqi trenches and bunkers,
plowing them under with Iraqi 
soldiers still alive inside.
The assault took place Feb
ruary 24 along a 10-mile front 
north of the border preceding 
an infantry attack. The offic
ers said most of the Iraqi sol
diers saw the tanks coming 
and surrendered, although 
possibly thousands perished 
inside their bunkers.
Civil rights bill sparks debate for Senators
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29, (DJ) 
Employees of the U.S. Senate 
may not be covered under the 
civil rights bill which moved to
ward Senate passage this past 
Tuesday.
Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell (D-Maine) and 
Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) ap
peared to have headed off an 
effort by Sen. Charles Grassley 
(R-Iowa) to extend the pending 
job-bias measure to Senate em
ployees. Currently, members of 
Congress are exempted from 
several anti-discrimination laws 
that relate to employment, even 
though these laws apply to the 
executive branch.
Several senators object 
strongly to subjecting them
selves to job-bias lawsuits on 
the grounds that they would vio
late the constitutional doctrine 
of separation of powers. An aide 
to Sen. Warren Rudman (RN.H.) said last week that if Con
gress were subject to certain civil 
rights laws, it might resemble 
the days when the crown used 
to regularly arrest members of 
Parliament on the way to meet.
But coming at a time when 
Congress reputation is tar
nished by the House check-overdraft scandal and the Senates 
clumsy handling of sexual ha
rassment charges dining the Su
preme Court nomination of 
Clarence Thomas, much of the 
Senate feared voting against 
Grassleys amendment.
The prospect of avoiding the 
issue head-on is likely to cause 
senators enormous relief.
Monday night, Sens. Mitchell
and Ford appeared to have 
brokered a compromise in which 
Senate employees could bring 
job-bias complaints to a newly 
created office in the Senate. A 
similar office is in operation for 
employees of the House of Rep
resentatives.
An aide to Sen. Ford said that 
under the compromise, Senate 
employees who werent satisfied 
with the Senates internal reso
lution of job-bias complaints 
would be eligible for some sort of 
redress in the courts.
According to a Senate aide, 
that redress would come in the 
form of review by the U.S. Court 
of Appeals, which would appear 
to eliminate the possibility of a 
jury trial.
Access to jury-awarded puni
tive damages for victims of sex
and disability-related employ
ment discrimination was a ma
jor point of contention in nego
tiations over the bill.
Civil rights groups are strongly 
advocating juries while the 
White House and many Senate 
Republicans favored having 
judges make the awards.
President Bush publicly 
weighed in on the issue in a 
speech last Thursday, when he 
called on Congress to submit to 
the laws it imposes on others, 
including strict enforcement proNews briefs courtesy of

CMOS considers changes
CMDS, from page 1
Overall, 435 students, faculty, and 
jtaff responded to the Carnegie Mellon 
pining Service survey. Student opin
ion is really strong, says Heydt, so we 
tried to select survey options that rep
resented the most severe contingen
ts. Heydt is quick to point out that 
any final decision goes far beyond sur
vey results alone, although student in
put remains a primary concern. We 
are trying to identify what students are 
looking for, and what we can continue 
to do for them. Carnegie Mellon DinjngService plans both face-to-face meetand focus groups run by both stu
dents and staff to gain feedback from 
our patrons, before any decisions are
finalized.
The restructuring of the meal plan 
presents special problems. Says Heydt, 
We are studying the meal plans of 
about 11 other similar schools, and 
trying to discover both what it is stu
dents want and what works best.
While Heydt calls the survey results 
very encouraging, a large part of the 
deficit represents the dilemma of in
creasing food costs coupled with marked 
decline of students buying large meal 
plans. Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
is scrambling to find methods to en
courage more people to buy meal plans 
and discover why many have left. Said 
Heydt, The program has always been 
financially solvent in the past, and it 
will be so in the future.

New policy 
makes 
clusters 
game-free
By MARK HELLIER
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Academic Computing Services has ' 
enacted a new policy that restricts com. 
puter users from playing games in the 
Universitys computer clusters this 
year. The policy restricted members of 
the Carnegie Mellon community from 
playing games in the West Wing cluster in the new dorms, and Wean 5202 
cluster in Wean Hall.
Although only two clusters are af. 
fected by the new policy, they comprise 
a large percentage of the Andrew work
stations and Macintosh Ilsis and IIcis 
on campus.
Wean 5202, a cluster with Macintosh 
Ilsis and Ilcis, was closed to game 
players to allow people who need to 
accomplish work access to the computers twenty-four hours a day.
West Wing, the Andrew workstation 
cluster, was restricted to game players 
so people could do work and because of 
numerous complaints of excessive noise 
from people who were playing games.
The idea of restricting gamers from 
computer access came from Gary 
Aulfingers, Cluster Services Manager. 
The new policy was enacted on October 
14.
The changes have received a mixed 
response from cluster users as shown 
by some posts on various Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys computer bulletin 
boards.
The response prompted Academic 
Computing to make slight modifica
tions in its policy. It now allows games 
to be played at certain times. Games 
are allowed in Wean 5202 from 2 - 8 am 
and in West Wing when a consultants 
present.

Increase in rates 
demands review
Starting in January, parking 
rates on campus are going to 
increase. This expense comes 
mid-year and mid-contract, and 
is a bad response to the Parking 
Offices financial problems.
People who hold permits to 
 park on campus paid a flat fee at 
the beginning of the school year. 
The permits they paid for are 
good for the fall and spring se
mesters. Suddenly, they will be 
asked to pay again to cover the 
amount of the increase.
One of the Parking Offices pre
mises is that it is okay for the 
parking rates to go up now that 
the salary increases are going 
through.
This is wrong. While certain 
faculty and staff may soon get 
this increase, others wont, and 
students are certainly not com
ing into this windfall.
Student Affairs response is to 
offer emergency loans to stu
dents who cant immediately 
cover this surprising new debt. 
This is a good response for Stu
dent Affairs; it is promoting a 
resource available to us, but it 
doesnt eliminate the problem 
at all  it only postpones the 
debt and makes it due to a dif
ferent office.
Another one of the Parking 
Offices premises is that this will 
reinforce the Universitys rec
ommendation that students do 
not bring cars to school.
The bottom line, however, is 
that students do bring cars to 
school and will continue to bring 
cars to school. Some students 
need them here. This includes 
commuter students, students
who work off campus, and stu
dents who live off campus. For 
some of them, alternate trans
portation is not available or not 
a reasonable alternative.
We realize that paying for the 
new garage and maintaining 
other parking facilities are in
centives for raising the parking 
rates.
Our complaint is that the in
crease is coming mid-year, and 
that the Parking Office is ask
ing for additional unexpected 
payment from permit-holders.
A solution which could benefit 
everyone is to offer permits by 
the semester. That way, for ex
ample, people whose time con
straints change from semester 
to semester can get a fall permit 
if they only need a fall permit. In 
addition, this will accommodate 
December graduates, January 
transfer students, or students 
who travel abroad for the se
mester who only need half of a 
permit.
By specializing parking like 
this, the Parking Office would 
be taking on a greater adminis
trative j obalthough no greater 
than the one it is taking on now 
with collecting the increase fees 
 and it would be in a better 
position to raise parking rates 
in the future without doing it 
mid-contract.
The semester-long parking 
permit as opposed to the cur
rent plan would allow both 
people who park on campus and 
the Parking Office greater flex
ibility instead of causing ani
mosity over an unexpected and 
ill-timed rise in parking rates.
Recycling efforts foiled 
by lack of opportunity
In the past year, the Carnegie 
Mellon community has made a 
tremendous push toward in
creasing participation in recy
cling programs. Now that recy
cling is an intrinsic part of our 
lives, and now that sorting our 
trash is part of the norm, we are 
ready to move on to the next 
step.
We need more recycling op
portunities.
There should be more glass 
recycling bins around campus 
including in the dorms, academic 
buildings, and Skibo. The glass 
recycling bins should be as ac
cessible as the aluminum recy
cling bins are.
There should be more paper 
recycling receptacles on campus. 
The heavy paper use is concen
trated in the clusters and of
fices, but plenty of recyclable 
paper waste is also generated in 
the dorms and classrooms.
Paper is highly recyclable. It 
is also very easy to be lazy and 
just throw it away. Readily avail
able paper bins will encourage 
people to go the extra distance 
to recycle.
The recycle bins that are avail
able now should be emptied more 
often. Sometimes, people wont 
try to stuff another can into the 
full container or add more paper 
to an already overflowing bin. 
These items end up in the gar
bage, which works against other

recycling efforts.
There should be more instruc
tion on campus about how to 
recycle.
There should be a list of what 
can or cant be recycled posted 
on or near recycling bins. There 
are still some people who dont 
recycle because they dont know 
how.
In addition, there should be 
signs around campus detailing 
where on campus or in the im
mediate area recyclable can be 
taken so people will know the 
extent of the available opportu
nities.
With the existing and poten
tial recycling opportunities in 
mind, members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community should take 
advantage of them.
It is at most a slight inconve
nience to carry an aluminum 
can to the nearest recycling bin, 
or to collect recyclable paper in 
your room until your next trip to 
a cluster.
The University offers a fairly 
successful plan for basic recy
cling. However, the campus 
needs more encouragement, 
easier access to all kinds of recy
cling bins, and more education.
The level of concern on cam
pus is evident  current prac
tice goes beyond the require
ments of the law. However, im
provements can be implemented 
to promote recycling.
Abortion rights remain 
a personal issue
Editor:
I would like to re
spond to the letter 
from the CMU Asso
ciation for Life in last 
weeks Tartan [AFL 
suggests viewing is
sue from all sides, 10/28].
The AFL first makes the point that 
not all pro-life organizations have 
religious affiliations. All pro-life or
ganizations do share the religious/ 
philosophical belief that life begins at 
conception. It is a fact that life is a 
continuum that began millions of years 
ago. Is it really logical to believe Terry 
Randall, founder of Operation Rescue, 
when he says in his film Higher Laws, 
There is really no difference between 
killing a four year-old child and abort
ing a pre-born 3-month-old?
Second, the AFL claims that the anti
choice group Operation Rescue is non
violent. This group stages regular dem
onstrations at Pittsburghs three 
womens health clinics. Several of these 
anti-choice protesters have been con
victed of assault. Pittsburgh clinics have 
been violently attacked in other ways: 
with fire bombing, by spillingtar in them, 
pollutingthem with noxious substances, 
having cars rammed in their doorways, 
poking holes in their roof, and shooting 
out their windows. To quote Terry 
Randall again, I am not a pacifist, I 
celebrate the Fourth of July and all that 
means, which was guns and bullets to 
get freedom.
Last, they mention the French drug, 
RU-486 (a.k.a. the French Abortion 
Pill). They claim that some pro-life 
organizations are not opposed to using 
the drug for non-abortion purposes. 
They fail to mention the threatened 
boycott by pro-life organizations of 
any pharmaceutical company which 
begins to test the drug, even for non
abortion purposes. They claim that the 
makers of RU-486 will not release the 
drug to be tested by the FDA, but fail to 
mention this threatened boycott as a 
reason.
Abortion is a complicated issue with 
many sides and many points of view, 
and cannot be simplified to a two-sided 
us and them argument. For this rea
son, any decision about abortion should 
be left to the individual to determine 
what is right for them.

CMU ROTC policy dis
criminates unfoundedly
mF
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
An article ap
peared in the latest 
issue of Focus that 
detailed the forced 
disenrollment of a 
Carnegie Mellon NROTC cadet due to 
his sexual orientation. This case clearly 
demonstrates that Carnegie Mellon is 
not abiding by its own Statement of 
Assurance which states Carnegie Mel
lon University does not discriminate in 
admission, employment, or adminis
tration of its programs on the basis of 
... sexual orientation.
This hypocrisy must stop. CMUs
administration has written letters to 
various members of the federal govern
ment and the military to protest the 
discrimination, only to be told that the 
policy of discriminating against gays 
and lesbians was not under review. It is 
quite ridiculous for Carnegie Mellon to 
ask the military to institute a policy of 
non-discrimination when it does not 
even enforce its own.
It is time to take further action. Start 
by forbidding the use of campus facili
ties and finances by ROTC, promising 
to replace the entire ROTC aid package 
of any student forced to disenroll be
cause of sexual orientation, and admit
ting in the Statement of Assurance 
that Carnegie Mellon continues to tol
erate discrimination in the case of 
ROTC. But, if the ROTC units of Carn
egie Mellon will not change to comply 
with University policy, they must be 
removed from our campus.
In addition, the Admissions Office 
regularly consults with ROTC officers 
on potential students whohave received 
ROTC scholarships. This is clearly dis
crimination in admission, specifically 
forbidden by the Statement of Assur
ance. The Admissions Office must im
mediately stop consulting with ROTC 
officers and must remove information 
about ROTC scholarships from their 
recruitment racks.
Carnegie Mellon claims not to dis
criminate. Carnegie Mellon ROTC dis
criminates. Carnegie Mellon lies.

tee of Student Sen
ate would like to 
thank The Tartan for 
all the attention weve been receiving. 
We believe that an informed student 
body is an active student body. How
ever, we would like to take issue with 
your recent editorial [Senate needs to 
repair tool replacement policy, 10/28] 
(and editorial cartoon) about the new 
policy regarding the replacement of 
equipment  not just tools  bor
rowed from individuals by student or
ganizations.
First of all, you misrepresented the 
policy. Your statement Students who 
lend tools to their organization will 
have to take the risk that if their tools 
are stolen, they will not receive any 
payment for replacement costs is, in a 
word, wrong. The policy simply states 
that Senate is not required to replace 
stolen items. We have the option of 
replacing stolen items on a case-bycase basis. (In this light, your editorial 
cartoon was way off the mark.) We were 
particularly bothered because an ear
lier Tartan article about the policy 
changes accurately quoted the policy, 
while your editorial did not.
In regards to the sixty-forty percent, 
$30 minimum suggestion, it was ex
actly this kind of fuzzy policy-making 
that Senate wanted to avoid. It was the 
opinion of F&R, and later of Senate, 
that a somewhat harsh but clearlydefined line was more useful than an 
ambiguous line drawn to fit some random criteria. What about a $29 drill? 
How about a $7,000 van? It is actually 
The Tartans suggested policy which is 
the less flexible, and the more poten
tially dangerous. We feel that it was 
The Tartan editorial staff, not the Sen
ate, which did not thoroughly think 
through the ramifications of their pro
posed policy.
Senate does not enact these policy 
changes because were bored and have 
nothing better to do. As can be imag
ined about any political process, chang
ing Senate policy is a lengthy process. 
However, these changes are made to 
head off potential serious problems in 
the future, based on issues we have 
faced in the past.
We have been very impressed with 
the accurate coverage Student Senate 
has been receiving in the. news section 
of The Tartan. We would hope that the 
editorials would be just as informed.

Letter to 
the Editor
tinely gets spewed on the Forum, I 
changed my mind. Regarding the cen
soring of my comic, Nuno is God, last 
week, I have several issues I would like 
to raise.
First, I have nothing against self
censorship  it is necessary for any . 
idea to be expressed clearly. However,
I question the appropriateness of the 
censorship in question. Why was I cen
sored that particular time, when pro
fanity is used so often in The Tartan 
comics? There has never been a prob
lem before but suddenly, and seem
ingly arbitrarily, my comic was cen
sored. Is The Tartan instituting a no
profanity policy? If so, exactly what 
words are considered taboo? Why were 
we not told about this?
Second, I am very annoyed at the fact 
that I was not notified about the edit
ing. I would never have agreed to hav
ing my comic printed in the watereddown version  I think the usage of 
nonsensical symbols to indicate pro
fanity is artificial and stupid. I would 
have changed the line altogether or 
asked that the comic not be printed at 
all. Believe it or not (and as pathetic as it 
may be), I put a fair amount of work into 
my comic and I find it offensive that 
someone trying to impose a moral code 
onto the comic pages of The Tartan (of all 
places...) saw fit to ruin it without warn
ing me. Now that The Tartan is requir
ing all comic writers to identify them
selves, I think it only fair that we know 
exactly what with our names are being 
associated.
Again, I am not taking this too seri
ously but it is another example of the 
often incompetent nature of The Tar
tan. I just thought you could use a 
reminder.

Brush up on political correctness
ft
Jason McDonald
0 hate to break it to all of you, but the 
politically Correct Pop Quiz is on its way 
^ Carnegie Mellon University. Thats 
right  theres going to be a test to see 
how much of your politically correct ter
minology youve retained since PC fell 
out of the public eye.
I feel compelled to help. The last thing 
Id want is for CMU to get a failing grade 
and be deemed a politically incorrect 
campus. Then our inflow of enlightened 
pCers would fall off, and all the great 
politically incorrect unwashed would 
show up on the Cut begging for admis
sion. Pretty soon, wed be just like 
Bethany College, and I cant accept that 
fate.
Therefore, I present my practice sheet 
for the PC Pop Quiz. Study well  these 
are just the sort of things youll have to 
know when the PC Pop Quiz arrives. 
Admittedly, I dont know when thats 
ig to be  rumor has it theyre busy 
trying to find Number Two pencils that 
arent longer than they are Wide.
But I digress. Some sample questions
from the test (I have my sources) are 
presented below, followed by my help
ful tips. Here we go!
Multiple Choice  The PC spelling 
of woman is now: A) woman; B) 
womyn; C) wymyn;D) womiin;E) xogql.
Surprisingly, the answer is E, al
though it is still pronounced, woman. 
Not only does it not contain the deriva
tive man, but it has the advantage 
that the letters m, a, and n are no
where in the word.
Short Answer Essay  What is 
wrong with this sentence? My friend 
Bob is very tall.
Seems normal, but the politically 
correct among you realized that short 
and tall are very prejudicial terms. 
Right-thinking members of society will 
use vertically challenged and verti
cally able, respectively.
 Fill-inThe item currently known 
as a manhole should be called a(n) 
___________?
. Your first impulse is probably some
thing to the effect that if youre wan
dering around knee-deep in sewage, 
you could care less what the exit is 
called, as long as its there. This is an 
admirable sentiment, but wrong. As 
stupid as it sounds, say person-hole 
and get full credit.
Fill-in/Multiple Choice  PC wed
ding vows should read, Do you take this
__________ to be your lawfully-wedded
_____________? A) man, husband; B)
woman, wife; C) person, person; D) 
bimbo, ball-and-chain; E) lard-ass, 
couch potato.
Not surprisingly, C is the correct an
swer. D and E are definitely wrong (though 
in some cases, more accurate), while A 
and B are accepted but too gender-oriented. Goodness knows we cant have 
that!
Deception  Who is the worlds best 
hockey player1?
Alarm bells should be going off in your 
headright aboutnow. This questionis one of 
the most dangerous ones of all because it has 
no right answer. Since hockey sticks are 
classic phallic symbols (especially here at 
CMU), knowing enough hockey to provide 
an answer to this question is, in and ofitself, 
politically incorrect. Make no attempt to 
answer or write thatyou dont follow hockey, 
and youll stay out of trouble.
 Word ProblemTrain A leaves Chicago 
at 1 pm travelling at....
Oops, wrong problem. Lets try this again.
Word Problem  You are working on 
a fishing trawler out in the middle of the 
Atlantic Ocean. One of your fellow 
crewmembers falls overboard trying to
boat a large swordfish, and someone yells, 
Man overboard!As the crew member near
est the drowning sailor, what do you do?
The natural answer that comes to mind is to 
throw the sailor a rope or a flotation device. 
Thats a beautiful sentiment, but it wont be 
much consolation when theyre slapping you 
with the tag of political incorrectness.
Remember that youre here to pass the 
test. Answer something like the follow
ing: When the crew rushes to the aid of 
the drowning sailor, theyll all be in one 
place. This would be a perfect time to 
explain to them that the proper phrasing 
should be Person overboard. 
Multiple Choice  Politically correct 
language: A) is a slip-shod way of glazing 
over society's problems through clever se
mantics; B) is the right idea, horribly 
misguided; C) provides fodder for smart
ass Forum columnists, but does little else 
of use; D) is the social force that will 
change the world.
D is the brownie-point answer here. If 
you take one of the other three, youre 
right, but you arent correct.

IFC pushes BYOB for all
Rich Robinson
Well, the war is on in the 
sandbox  again. Its amaz
ing how many people in col
lege have not changed since 
they were in kindergarten. I 
can remember how little chil
dren responded when they 
were not allowed to play with 
a certain toy, or didnt have a 
toy someone else had. They 
responded with the line, If I 
cant have it, neither can you!  
Then they would proceed to 
jump up and down on the new 
Tonka toy so that no one could 
have it.
I know this seems rather 
ridiculous to you now, as we 
are all in college and suppos
edly much more mature. But 
after seeing the Inter-Frater
nal Council in action, I believe 
that the game is still the same 
 its just the sandbox that
has changed.
Once again, the Founders 
Purchasing Insurance Group 
(FPIG) insurance policy has 
come into the limelight. For 
those of you who do not know 
what this is, FPIG is one of 
many risk management in
surance policies for fraterni
ties. However, it is very re
strictive in its alcohol policy 
that subscribing fraternities 
must follow. The major re
striction placed on fraterni
ties with FPIG is that they 
are not allowed to have air 
taps for kegs.
Currently, about ten of the 
sixteen fraternities on cam
pus are under the FPIG policy. 
Their nationals have decided 
that^the best way to manage 
their chapters is with FPIG. 
However, there are still six 
houses on campus that have 
different policies that do not 
restrict the use of air taps and 
kegs.
So, the sandbox is IFC and
the kids without the toy are 
the houses under FPIG. So 
naturally, they have re
sponded by saying If we cant 
have it, no one can! and have 
begun to try to push their 
restrictions on the other six 
houses.
What, then, happens when 
kegs are banished from the 
campus? Once again, the 
FPIG houses have begun 
their BYOB chant. And once 
again, they ignore the prob
lems inherent with BYOB. 
First, there is no control over 
what or how much guests at 
parties drink.
Second, you have bottles of 
alcohol being carried around 
outside, which is strictly 
against campus policy.
Third, you have the prob
lem of broken bottles lit

Hearings cast light 
on harassment issue
Chris Restifo
It has been a couple of weeks 
since Clarence Thomas was con
firmed, by the narrowest mar
gin in history, to the Supreme 
Court. People are still reeling 
from all the aspects involved. At 
issue were the arguments of 
abortion, privacy, natural law, 
and Thomas political views. 
However, all that seems insig
nificant now. Clarence Thomas 
nomination will not be noted by 
the history books as one dealing 
with such topics, but as one that 
opened up that ugly can of worms 
known as sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is a tricky 
subject to deal with, especially 
when youre trying to decide who 
said what, who did what, and 
whos telling the truth. I would
expect people as educated as 
Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas, 
and members of the Senate to 
handle it in a mature, respect
able manner, but I guess I could 
be wrong.
The first question that comes 
into my mind is why Anita Hill 
waited to bring this information 
forward. Many out there argue 
that she wasnt pressured, but 
circumstantial evidence indi
cates that she might have been 
pushed. For example, she did 
not contact the Judiciary Com
mittee. When a man told the 
head of the Alliance for Justice 
that Hill was harassed by Tho
mas, the information was given 
to Senator Metzenbaum. Hill 
was phoned twice, but only on 
the second phone call did she 
agree to think about harass
ment. When she finally talked, 
the charges (which is what her 
allegations were turning into) 
were referred to Harriet Grant,

F&R makes loan for 
charity event
Editor:
We would 
like to clarify 
the circum
stances sur
round i n g 
Senates loan of $765 to Kappa 
Kappa Gamma to support a 
dance to benefit the Womens 
Center and Shelter of Pitts
burgh. Funding such events vio
lates Student Senate fiscal 
policy, which states (Section 1 
4-a) that Events which donate 
their proceeds to charity will not 
be funded by the Activities Fee. 
This policy reflects the idea that 
when an organization raises 
ffioney for charity, the organiza
tion should raise money, rather 
than ask other organizations to 
"locate money for charity.
When Kappa Alpha Theta re
vived funding for the Mr. Fraernity Contest, the fiscal policy 
Was not yet binding on Senate,

amnia came forward for their 
Request for the funding of a

revised to be binding and
adopted by Senate.
felt that Kappa Kappa 
amnias dance with music proVl ed by the Affordable Floors is 
Worthwhile, and wished to 
e P in some way. Thus we ofered Kappa Kappa Gamma a 
oan to cover all costs incurred. 
e loan is to be repaid only if
ticket sales exceed the loan 
amount. If ticket sales are low 
and Kappa Kappa Gamma fails 
to recover the amount of the 
loan, the loan need not be paid 
back. F&R feels that this form of 
loan is a fair and appropriate 
compromise and supported this 
particular allocation unani
mously. Senate supported the 
loan overwhelmingly, with a vote 
of 21-0-1.
The F&R Committee would 
like to wish Kappa Kappa 
Gamma the best of luck with the 
dance and with the effort to raise 
money for the worthy cause they 
have chosen.

U. S. policy hurts 
equality of all
Editor:
The United 
States mil
itarys policy 
on homosexu
ality reads:
Homosexuality is incompatible 
with military service. The pres
ence of such members adversely 
affects the ability of the Armed 
Forces to maintain discipline, 
good order, and morale; to foster 
mutual trust and confidence 
among the members; to ensure 
the integrity of the system of 
rank and command; to facilitate 
assignment and work under
close conditions affording mini
mal privacy; to recruit and re
tain members of the military 
services; and, in certain circum
stances, to prevent breaches of 
security.
This policy is clearly discrimi
natory and should end. Whether 
it is admitted or not, there is a 
large number of gays and lesbi
ans in the armed forces who suc
cessfully carry out their duties. 
I know of at least three gay or 
lesbian cadets in Carnegie Mel
lon University ROTC who have 
served onboard ships and in the 
units in outstanding capacities. 
When I was in the military there 
were several gay men who ev
eryone knew were gay and there 
were no conflicts. I am not sug
gesting that problems do not 
exist between homophobic mem
bers and gay/lesbian members, 
but these could be handled just 
as racist members were handled 
following integration.
The United States has even 
produced the famous 
PERSEREC (Department of 
Defense Personnel Security Re
search & Education Center) re
port entitled Nonconforming 
Sexual Orientations and Mili
tary Suitability that found that 
gays and lesbians could be and 
should be integrated in the mili
tary. It points out that, The 
order to integrate blacks was 
first met with stout resistance 
by traditionalists in the mili
tary establishment. Dire conse
quences were predicted for main
taining discipline, building
group morale, and achieving 
military organizational goals. 
None of these predictions have 
come true. Social Science spe
cialists helped develop programs 
for combating racial discrimina
tion so that the military services 
are leaders in providing equal 
opportunity for black men and 
women. It would be wise to con
sider applying the experience of 
the past 40 years to the integra
tion of homosexuals.
Denmark, Sweden, Finland, 
Norway, Spain, France, and the 
Netherlands, among other coun
tries, all allow gays and lesbians 
to serve in their armed forces.
It is time the United States 
military caught up with the 
times and the rest of the world.

ROTC sacrifices 
qualified cadets
Editor:
The recent 
attention to 
a situation 
on campus 
concerning a 
Reserve Officers Training 
Corp student who was pres
sured to resign from the pro
gram on the basis of sexual 
orientation once again brings 
up the question of why the 
ROTC program is allowed to 
continue to exist at this uni
versity.
I assume that if, for example,
a student organization practiced 
discrimination, the University 
would step in and take action to 
correct this. And of course, that 
is what should be done. So why 
does the University continue to 
ignore the obvious discrimina
tory practices of the ROTC pro
gram?
There is no justification for 
the University not to take ac
tion on this matter. I personally 
believe that Carengie Mellon 
University wont abolish the 
Universitys ROTC program be
cause the program provides fi
nancial assistance to these stu
dents and thus, Carnegie Mel
lon University financial aid 
doesnt have to.
But Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity should not be sacrificing 
ethics because of the Uni
versitys inability to handle their 
budget properly and provide the 
extra financial aid needed to 
assist these students.
Although the campus commu
nity cannot directly alter the 
militarys policy on the matter, 
we can change what is happen
ing on our own campus to let the 
military know that we will not 
tolerate discrimination in any 
form.
The time has come for the 
University to send a message to 
the military by taking action 
concerning the ROTC program. 
And that message is shape up 
or ship out!

Thomas harassment case provides national stage
THOMAS, from page 7
chief of Judiciary nominations.
Ok, so far so good. There was 
nothing wrong with Hills ac
tions. Why, then, did she ask for 
confidentiality? Why, then, did 
she at first refuse to have an FBI 
investigation undertaken? She 
claims that she didnt trust its 
use, but what could be the harm? 
If she was telling the truth, she 
had nothing to lose.
Hill finally agreed to an inves
tigation. Some aides to Sena
tors, however, think that she 
may have been coerced. Regard
less of whether or not she was 
forced, the investigation, which 
was completed in only two days, 
reported that it was Thomas 
word versus Hills. I dont trust 
any investigation that takes only 
two days, but I feel it would not 
have turned up much more evi
dence. The FBI could have prob
ably found more witnesses to 
support Hill and her accusations, 
but witnesses could also have 
been located for Thomas. A 
former assistant to Thomas de
scribed Hill as overly ambitious 
and arrogant. Either way, it still 
seems to remain a case of he 
said/she said.
Of course, the Senates actions 
werent much better. Senator 
Biden claims he told other Demo
cratic Senators of the charges, 
but on6 said he hadnt even heard 
of them. Senator Thurmond, a 
Republican, failed to tell the 
other Republican Senators on 
the committee. Its nice to see 
that the Senate is trying to ig
nore an important issue. Then 
again, thats nothing new.
In the middle of all this argu
ing, however, I think that many 
have lost sight of the important 
point here. The idea of what con
stitutes sexual harassment is 
being ignored. It was only in 
1980 that the EEOC determined 
that unwelcome sexual behav
ior was covered by the Civil 
Rights Act. In 1986, the Supreme 
Court gave bite to the bark when 
it de cided in Meritor Savings Bank 
vs. Vinson that such behavior was 
illegal. Thus, we have a period of
roughly 11 years in which sexual 
harassment was illegal, but no one 
knew what sexual harrassment 
was. Andl fear that what happened 
to Thomas (and to former CMU 
president Richard Cyert) is indica
tive of whats to come.
Before anyone jumps the gun 
and attempts to rip this paper 
apart for a columnist saying that 
hes against people prosecuting 
others for sexual harassment, 
let me say that nothing could be 
further from the truth. Im glad 
that companies, the government, 
the military, and other organi
zations are finally providing 
methods for bearing grievances, 
and more importantly, develop
ing programs to educate their 
employees and supervisors 
about sexual harassment. How
ever, prosecuting someone for 
doing something that wasnt il
legal at the time is pretty scary. 
How would you feel if someone 
brought charges against you 
years after the act(s) were sup
posedly committed?

jumping on the bandwagon, 
claiming that they will use the 
disillusionment of women with 
the Senate to remove incum
bents. That would be hard, 
though. From surveys, its been 
found that a majority of women 
sided with Thomas, not with Hill. 
A good number of women ques
tioned why Hill didnt tell Tho
mas to stop his behavior. Some 
people question why someone 
would put up with such acts 
when she or he could just leave?
Many women who work in 
higher-paying jobs and women 
with college educations answer 
this question by explaining that 
when they suffered harassment, 
they stayed on and put up with 
the lewd remarks and comments
because they needed the jobs. 
They felt that if they made any 
complaints or rocked the boat, 
they would be given trouble. Un
fortunately, that is true. If a 
woman made issue of a mans 
sexual harassment, she could ex
pect to be harassed even more, 
demoted, or even fired. That situ
ation is hopefully changing for 
the better. With education, em
ployers and supervisors are much 
more receptive to complaints.
Such progress is commendable 
but it is no reason for those whj 
were wronged years ago to bri^ 
charges against those whom they 
claim harassed them. No, such a 
policy doesnt make the behavio, 
acceptable or even tolerable. Ho, 
ever,onlynowdopeoplerealize tim
they can say no to such behavior 
and do something about it.
And its only now that people 
are being told its wrong and % 
gal. We may say that Hillj 
charges raised national awareness to the problem of sexual ha. 
rassment, but trying to accuse 
the man and bring charges 
against him is just a little too 
radical.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  4 November 19919
FPIG offers restrictions without solutions
What IFC and the FPIG houses are concerned with is 
NOT the evils of alcohol. They are concerned that 
they arent allowed to have keg parties while other 
houses will be.
ppIG, from page 7
threatening, recycled plastic
cupsFourth, you have the prob
lem of fights and confronta
tions with the police while 
people are holding bottles. Do 
you think that they are going 
to put a good weapon down 
after drinking uncontrolla
bly? I dont think so. I also do 
n0t think that Campus Po
lice are going to want to deal 
with people who are going to 
throw bottles at them, or with 
two people who have cut each 
other up with shards of glass.
Currently, IFC has a good 
alcohol policy. Its best policy 
is one of a sober patrol, where 
designated brothers stay so
ber during a party to help 
control people, determine 
when people should be cut 
off, to call security to help 
people home and overall to 
act as responsible adults with 
clear heads when other 
people are not.
At Kappa Sigma, the sober 
patrol system works well. Six 
brothers stay sober for the 
night, working bar, door, and 
patrolling the party to make 
sure there are no problems. 
In addition, they wear bright 
red shirts marked Sober 
Patrol so that if someone 
needs help, he or she knows 
who to go to. In addition, the 
house had a meeting with 
Chief LaPaglia, head of Cam
pus Police, who worked with 
members of the fraternity to 
ensure proper management 
of the sober patrol.
From what Ive heard, how
ever, many of the houses have 
not really given much power 
to this idea. This is because 
IFC has been very laissezfaire on enforcing any new 
ideas that have come up, es
pecially their latest alcohol 
policy, which had many ex
cellent working ideas. They 
find it much easier to take 
someone elses laws and im
pose these on everyone, re
gardless of the consequences 
that will come from them.
FPIG is not a bad idea be
cause it gets rid of kegs. It is 
not a bad idea because it tries 
to restrict alcohol use. It is a 
bad idea because the ways 
that will be used to get 
around the no-keg policy will 
cause more problems and will 
not solve any problems we 
are seeing now.
What IFC and the FPIG 
houses are concerned with is 
NOT the evils of alcohol. 
They are concerned that they 
arent allowed to have keg 
parties while other houses
will be. They are not con
cerned with womens and 
other guests safety at par
ties, or else they would have 
more than one brother on 
their sober patrol. They are 
not concerned about risk 
management, or the control
lability of parties, but instead 
think that their parties wont 
be as good or out of control 
because they dont have kegs.
Before IFC thinks of pass
ing anything dealing with 
FPIG, it had better look at 
the facts. It also better re
member their duty is to be 
impartial. Its time for the 
fraternities to grow the hell
up. Just because their na
tional doesnt think they are 
doing a good job at managing 
themselves doesnt mean that 
other houses are the same. 
There are six houses out there 
that have been managing 
themselves well, according to 
their nationals policies. 
Management of insurance 
policies is not IFCs realm. 
Leave it where it belongs  
with the nationals.
What IFC doesnt seem to re
alize is that it has an excellent 
alcohol policy. What it needs to 
do, however, is enforce the policy 
and build on it. Ask Campus 
Police to hold mandatory edu
cational seminars on proper pro
cedures for sober patrols. Make 
sure that houses are controlling 
the use of alcohol at parties 
through an interfraternal sober 
patrol.
Also, the houses and IFC 
members pushing for BYOB 
need to look before they leap. 
How about getting Campus 
Polices position on bottles at 
parties and outside on the 
quad? And how about taking 
a rational look at what ef
fects BYOB will bring. I have 
already pointed out that more 
harm will come than good.
Finally, I know for a fact 
that many of the FPIG houses 
violate their policy on a regu
lar basis. I cannot see what 
type of position they are in 
that they can have the gall to 
try and push their policy on 
other houses when they do 
not even follow it themselves.

SPORTS
Football sinks Coast Guard
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Its gotta 
be the ... 
never mind!
Its a fact that life is a little 
rocky sometimes. Most of the 
time, the problems encoun
tered are just little bumps; 
other times, theyre a little 
more major. For some strange 
reason (probably genetic), I 
consider the purchase of new 
shoes one of the bigger deals of 
day-to-day living.
This explains why I only get 
new shoes when I can see my 
toes poking through the old 
ones; this sort of life-altering 
decision is just too difficult for 
me, and it almost always 
requires some level of physical 
discomfort to get me moving.
Unlike the average shoe 
purchaser, Im very unswayed 
by the mass media. I dont 
really care whether I wear the 
same shoes as Bo Jackson or 
Michael Jordan. Im still going 
to have trouble dribbling a 
basketball with my off hand, 
much less doing a slam dunk 
or bench-pressing a Yugo.
For that matter, the Ghost of 
Basketball Shoes Past still 
haunts me to this day. I tried 
high-tops back in the third 
grade when I played hoops 
regularly (back in the day 
when shoes werent differenti
ated by the pro player doing 
the sales pitch on TV). After 
running the whole range from 
inconvenience to ankle pain 
taking the things on and off, I 
decided that high-tops (and by 
association, the sport of 
basketball) werent for me.
Unfortunately, without 
commercials to direct my 
buying judgement, I just go 
with a brand until something 
else catches my eye. This 
tends to lead to interesting 
results  this is how I got into 
my brief but meaningful affair 
with British Knights shoes.
For some reason, I, as a college 
freshman, felt a compulsive 
need for red quasi-eelskin.
This time out, I was thrown 
from my complacency by a 
cruel trick of fate. First of all, 
the model of Diadora soccer 
shoes that I liked disappeared, 
replaced by an uglier, neongreener variety. After a 
lengthy battle between taste 
and maintaining the status 
quo, I gave in to the Neon 
Nightmares, only to find that 
they didnt have them in my 
size anyway.
I was able to stay brandloyal, mostly after reeling in 
shock from the 84-dollar price 
tag on the best-looking pair of 
Nikes. I settled on a pair of 
white Diadora tennis shoes 
with a smattering of green and 
purple. Trust me  it sounds 
ugly, but the color combination 
works.
Its weird, though. Every 
time I look down at my exces
sively plain white feet, I feel I 
should be an X-ray technician 
or a dental hygienist. Someone 
ught to write a book on the 
shock of switching between 
Wack and white shoes. Espe
cially how to deal with the 
confusion that arises from 
wearing black shoes for some 
events and white shoes for 
others.
I think next time, Im just 
going to buy combat boots. 
Theyre ugly, theyre hard to 
run in, but Ill never have to 
replace them.

The Coast Guard Academy 
Bears made a seasons worth of 
mistakes in one game on Satur
day. The Tartans made their 
share, too, but were able to over
come them on their way to a 
thrilling 25-19 win, their eighth 
straight victory.
It wasnt a pretty game, said 
sophomore linebacker Chad 
Wilson.
Were not a pretty team, 
added sophomore safety Doug 
Stauffer. But our team doesnt 
know how to lose. Thats what 
keeps us going.
It helped that Coast Guard 
had nine penalties for 125 yards. 
Senior comerback J eff Palaimas 
fourth quarter interception and 
Stauffers fumble recovery with 
5:40 left in the second quarter 
helped, too. The interception 
thwarted a Coast Guard come
back attempt, and the fumble 
recovery set up the game-winning score.
One mistake led to another, 
fortunately in favor of the Tar
tans. Freshman quarterback 
Chris Dee was sacked by tackle 
Kevin Smythe, resulting in a
fumble that was recovered by 
linebacker Wayne Arguin. The 
Bears failed to capitalize on the 
turnover, and in fact gave the 
ball back to the Tartans as 
Stauffer recovered an Aaron W aters fumble seconds later.
Dougs play was really big 
because they had just scored, 
said linebacker Mike Hession, a 
graduate student. If they scored 
again, it might have been a whole 
different ballgame.
Thirteen seconds into the 
game, a Tartan fumble placed 
the Bears at the CMU 26 and set 
them up for their first score. 
Junior quarterback Kevin Talley 
scrambled 23 yards on the op
tion to give Coast Guard a quick 
7-0 lead.
But the Tartans quickly 
bounced back as senior halfback 
Greg Marmol returned the en
suing kickoff 40 yards to the 
Coast Guard 43. Then, on sec
ond and nine from the 42, 
Marmol darted 39 yards to give 
the Tartans first and goal at the 
three.
Dee ran the ball in from one 
yard out, and junior Fred 
Harding added the extra point 
to even the score at 7-7 with 
with 11:53 left to go in the first
Were not a pretty team, but our 
team doesnt know how to lose. 
Thats what keeps us going.
 Doug Stauffer, 
sophomore safety
quarter.
The Bears scored again on 
their next possession, driving 
56 yards in eight plays with key 
pass completions to junior half
back Jeff Jones and senior half
back Dave Dawdy for 33 and 22 
yards, respectively. After a 
missed extra point, the score 
favored the Bears, 13-7.
With the option, because they 
run it so much and there are so 
many different guys going ev
erywhere, you know theyre go
ing to pick up yards, said 
Hession. Youve just got to make 
sure you dont give up the big 
play, which we did a couple times 
in the first half. Fortunately, 
the coaches settled us down and 
we shut them down.
The Tartans answered the 
sassy Coast Guard offense in 
the first minute of the second
quarter. Dee connected with 
sophomore wide receiver Jarrod 
Siket on a 79-yard touchdown 
pass to put the Tartans back in 
control, 1413.
They were playing man-toman and that opened up a lot of 
things for us, said Siket. We 
just caught them in it, we had a 
good play call and everybody 
blocked, and the next thing you 
know, were going down the side
line. It was simple.
Talley & Co. dominated most 
of the quarter with a 16-play, 
81-yard touchdown drive that 
ate 8:17 off the clock and gave 
Coast Guard a 19-14 lead. But 
the Tartans didnt give up with
out a fight, forcing two fumbles 
(which were recovered by Coast 
Guard) and breaking up a pass 
during the series.
Following Stauffers fumble
recovery, the Tartans put to
gether an eight-play, 72-yard 
touchdown drive capped off by a 
seven-yard run by Marmol. Dee 
took it in himself on the twopoint conversion to make the 
score 2219.
Harding added a 31 -yard field 
goal as time expired to round 
out the scoring.
Neither team managed to get 
the ball into the end zone in the 
second half, but both teams came 
close in the fourth quarter.
Aided by two pass interfer
ence penalties against the Bears, 
the Tartans moved to within 
striking distance at the Coast 
Guard 20 yardline. After three 
unsuccessful attempts at the 
endzone, the Tartans tried a 37- 
yard field goal. But the kick 
sailed wide left and Coast Guard 
took over and began their suspense-filled bid to win the game.
The Bears drove as far as the 
CMU seven-yard line with two 
key fourth down conversions by 
Talley. His 28-yard run to the 
seven had the Tartans feeling 
the heat. But Talley determined 
his own fate when, facing a fierce 
Tartan pass rush, he threw the 
ball away and was whistled for

Mens soccer 
wins finale in OT

Freshman midfielder Vince Russell prepares to drive the ball upfield.

The Carnegie Mellon mens soccer 
team finished its season on Saturday 
with a 3-2 overtime victory over 
Dickinson College. The win gave the 
Tartans a final season record of 10-4- 
3, and left the door open for possible 
playoff action.
The Tartans chances began early 
when they received a penalty kick in 
the first half, but they missed the kick. 
CMU finally got on the board when 
junior forward Terence Sibiya scored a 
goal early in the second half, assisted 
by sophomore midfielder Min Chong. 
The Tartans missed a second penalty 
kick, and Dickinson scored a goal to tie 
the game at one.
In overtime, Sibiya scored a second 
goal in the first overtime period, as
sisted by freshman midfielder Alex 
Amezquita. In the second overtime pe
riod, senior forward Rob Schaeffer
headed the ball into the goal off of a 
corner kick. Dickinson scored a second 
goal late in the second overtime period, 
but the Tartans prevented them from 
scoring again.
The game was a very aggressive one; 
several players were cautioned, and 
three players were sent off the field for 
severe fouls. According to Sibiya, many 
of the referees calls were unreason
able. He started to lose control at the 
end of the second half of the game. 
Stivoric explained the Tartans perfor
mance. We werent able to capitalize 
early in the game, he said. If we had 
made the penalty kicks, the game prob
ably wouldnt have gone into overtime.
The game was important to the Tar
tans on many levels. In addition to the 
possibility of post-season play, the 
match was important because it was 
the first time they played Dickinson. 
Finally, the game was the final one for 
assistant coach Dan Moss. This will be 
Mosss last year with the Tartans.
CMU swim teams prepare for fresh start
By DARYL DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The mens and womens swim
ming teams will open their sea
son on Saturday when they 
travel to the College of Wooster. 
This will be the first meet for 
head coach Jim Cutrone as the 
head of Carnegie Mellons swim 
teams. It will also be the first 
meet for a majority of the team 
members.
The mens team consists of 25 
members, only six of whom are 
returning juniors and seniors. 
The womens team of ten has 
three returning junior and se
nior members. However, accord
ing to Cutrone, the youth of the 
team is compensated for in 
dedication.A lot of the fresh
men come from smaller pro
grams and they are working 
harder and longer than they 
have before, he said.
Coach Cutrone is confident 
that his team will do well this 
year. In practice, the majority 
of the team say theyre faster 
this year than last year, he said. 
This includes senior Brian 
Zimmerman, who is a two-time 
national champion.
The newcomers also have 
strength, as demonstrated by
freshmen Jason Burkey who 
swam an impressive 21.80 in 
practice for the 5 0-yard freestyle. 
Freshman Donald Nelson and 
sophomore Jonathan Kline have 
also had impressive showings 
during practices, according to 
Cutrone. Cutrone also men
tioned the depth of this years 
mens squad as a reason for con
fidence coming into the season.
Unfortunately, the womens 
team lacks the depth of the mens 
team. Although the team is weak 
in numbers, freshmen such as 
Joanne Kievan and Dianne Keen 
are making a strong showing.
The meet against Wooster will
be a difficult first test for the 
women swimmers. Woosters 
women are ranked among the 
top five teams in the nation. The 
Tartans dont know what to ex
pect from the Wooster mens 
team, as they are an unknown 
in the league.
The Tartan swimmers began 
practice several weeks ago for 
this season. These practices en
compass 10-and-a-half hours of 
commitment a week, not includ
ing the meets. Part of that prac
tice time includes weight lifting 
sessions and a once-a-week early 
morning swim.
Its a lot of hard work, said
Kievan, but you feel good about 
the exercise and the team is a 
fun group of people. The coach is 
very enthusiastic. He makes an 
effort to help all individual team 
members to find their strong 
points.
Coach Cutrone feels that the 
team is ready for the coming 
season. All the signs are there 
that we will perform well, he 
said. The teams will have their 
first home meet on November 
16, a week after the season 
opener at Wooster. The home 
opener, against John Carroll 
University, will begin at 1 pm at 
Skibo Gym.
Womens soccer hopes for UAA future as season ends
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team ended its first var
sity season on a high note, pick
ing up a 10 win over Hiram 
College.
Even though it was cold and 
windy, we were psyched because 
it was our last game, said sophomore forward Rachel Bourn. 
They were pretty psyched be
cause it was the last game for
them, too.
The Tartans got the lone goal 
of the game early in the second 
half; freshman midfielder Chris
tina Isaly fired a hard shot into 
the corner of the Hiram net. 
However, according to Bourn, 
the 1-0 score was misleading as 
the game wasnt even that close.
We were making good con
nections on our passes, and we 
were getting a lot of shots on 
goal, she said. We had a lot of 
shots that missed an inch to one
side or another, or bounced off 
the crossbar.
The win gave the Tartans a 
final season record of 10-4; fur
thermore, all but one of the Tar
tan wins were shutouts. Bourn 
attributes this to tough compe
tition and great goalkeeping by 
senior Elena Chartoff and sopho
more Trish Henrich.
The defense had a strong sea
son, but both our goal keepers 
were great, said Bourn. You 
could really flip a coin to decide
between them. They were both 
so good.
As far as the 1-0 games go, 
sometimes its like that. You get 
difficult teams, and theyre 
strongly-fought games that come 
down to one goal.
Now that the 1991 season is 
over, its on to bigger and better 
thingsat least the team mem
bers hope so. The players wrote 
letters to members of the Carn
egie Mellon administration, 
pleading their case for funding
to begin University Athletic As
sociation competition next sea
son. This season, the Carnegie 
Mellon team played a schedule 
of local club and varsity teams. 
A decision on the teams status 
for next season will be made 
within the next few weeks.
Weve proven ourselves on the 
field, so we know we can com
pete well with most of the UAA 
teams. Now its up to the admin
istration because its become a 
matter of money, said Bourn.

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  4 November 1991
Kennedy family unfairly stereotyped by name of Washington stadium
I was glancing through the Novem
ber 4 issue of Sports Illustrated earlier 
and saw something that made the poli
tician in me cringe. In the Pro Football 
section I happened upon a section called 
Critiquing the News. The author of 
the column brought up the controversy 
about changing the Redskins nickname. 
He wrote that Washingtons use of the 
name Redskins was racist, pure and 
simple. I understand the theory of 
political correctness, but theres such 
thing as going too far. I can see the 
point of Native American protest, but I 
really dont see the need for a name 
change.
The use of the nickname Redskins
NFL FOOTBALL
by Dave Martin
doesnt strike me as all that offensive. 
They are only the best team in the 
National Football League this year. The 
author uses a capitalist-pig reasoning 
to try to convince his audience that 
changing the name is a good thing. I
have to wonder if the motivation for 
protesting the name isnt just as finan
cially motivated.
Tonights game should prove to be a 
decent competition between two mediocre-at-best teams. The New York 
Giants are recovering from a fairly 
embarrasing loss to the Washington 
Redskins last Sunday, and could use a 
victory at Philadelphias Veterans Sta
dium to stay alive in their bid for a 
playoff spot. The Eagles, however, are 
in serious danger of having a bad sea
son. This game should assure it. Giants 
21, Eagles 17.
Sundays games dont prove to be 
exciting to the mind, with such classic
matchups as the undefeated Redskins 
taking on the Atlanta Falcons at RFK 
Stadium (why dont the Kennedys com
plain about the use of RFICs initials?) 
and the Indianapolis Colts at the New 
York Jets. Its fairly obvious, unfortu
nately, that the Redskins will walk 
away with another victoryI hope Im 
wrong. I kinda like the Falcons  34r6. As for the Colts-Jets game, I could 
really care much more. Jets at home, 
38-10.
There is one interesting game, though. 
San Francisco visits the Superdome to 
meet the once beaten New Orleans 
Saints. Young has continued to play at 
a rather good level of mediocrity. The
Saints shouldnt fall again soon. Saints 
24, 49ers 17.
As for the rest of the NFL: Houston 
over Dallas easily, Phoenix over the 
Giants in Tempe, Seattle over San Di
ego, Buffalo over Green Bay rather 
comfortably, the Raiders in a good game 
over the Broncos, Miami over the Patriots, Detroit over Tampa Bay, the 
Chiefs in a close one with the Rams, 
Cleveland on the lake over the Eagles. 
I hate to do it, but I suspect the Bengals 
will take their second victory from the 
Steelers.

CMU football picks up 
mistake-filled victory
FOOTBALL, from page xx
intentional grounding.
The penalty backed the Bears 
up to the Carnegie Mellon 23. 
After the Bears failed to convert 
on fourth and long, the Tartans 
had all the insurance they 
needed. With 37 seconds left in 
regulation, Dee downed the ball 
as the clock ticked to a Tartan 
25-19 victory.
With next week off, the Tar
tans will have time to regroup 
and heal up for their next big 
game, a key University Athletic 
Association match-up against 
Case Western Reserve. I think 
the week offs going to help a 
lot, said Pizzurro. Weve got a 
lot of guys nicked up, andlthink
the time off will give guys a 
chance to recuperate and get 
back to a hundred percent.
The Case game will determine 
the UAA champion. If the Tar
tans beat Case, they preserve 
their undefeated conference 
record and win their second con
secutive UAA title outright. If 
they lose, they finish tied for the 
top spot with Rochester, whose 
only conference loss was to the 
Tartans.
More importantly, the Tartans
need a win against Case to keep 
their playoff hopes alive. I think 
the whole teams going to be up, 
said Marmol. We have a lot 
riding on this game, the UAA 
championship and the playoffs, 
sol think everyone will be ready 
to go.
We cant control what hap
pens with the playoffs, added 
Pizzurro. We can only control 
how we play against Case. If we 
beat Case, I think everyone feels 
that it will work out for us.

NROTC explained
By JOHN HEYEL 
& .JEANEL NOGGLE
Special to The Tartan
If youve heard it once, youve heard it 
a thousand times: Its not just ajob, its 
an adventure. You see the midship
men wearing uniforms and performing 
methodical drills every Thursday af
ternoon. Although this is part of the 
job, where is the adventure?
Every Thursday afternoon, 200 Car
negie Mellon and University of Pitts
burgh students assemble in Navy or 
Marine Corps uniforms somewhere on 
campus. Have you ever wondered why 
these people do this, or perhaps what 
drives them to get up two or three times 
j week at 6 am for physical training? 
You might think that they are crazy or 
in it for the money, but over one third of 
the midshipmen battalion are not even 
on scholarship. There is a whole lot 
more that the Navy Reserve Officer 
Training Corps program offers its mid
shipmen than people realize.
While midshipmen are members of 
the NROTC unit, they have many op
portunities to participate in activities 
associated with the battalion. Several 
times a semester the midshipmen go 
rock climbing, rappelling, and 
orienteering with the Semper Fidelis 
Society. The Aviation Club travels an
nually to Pensacola, FL to live their 
own Top Gun experience, while the 
SilentService and the Surface Warfare 
societies make numerous trips to the 
Norfolk, VA, Naval Base.
The rifle and pistol teams practice 
weekly at the Duquesne range and com
pete in several competitions through
out the year. Some of the other teams 
that are involved in intercollegiate com
petition are the Drill Team, which ex
ecutes precision rifle drill and the Mili
tary Excellence Team, which excels in 
physical fitness events such as the 
4x400 relay, 1 OK run, pull-ups, and situps. Both groups travel to schools all 
around the nation, including Cornell, 
Northwestern, Penn State, and 
Villanova. This gives the midshipmen 
an opportunity to visit different col
leges and meet other people.
Each year, several motivated mid
shipmen train and run as a group in 
The Great Race and the Pittsburgh and 
Marine Corps Marathons. On our own 
campus, the midshipmen participate 
heavily in intramural sports. NROTC 
plays a major role in giving individuals 
an opportunity to participate in cam
pus activities, as well as a variety of 
other experiences not normally made 
accessible to the average college stu
dent. This participation enhances the 
development of future Naval and Ma
rine Corps officers.
The midshipmen complement their 
extensive University involvement with 
strong commitments to the community. 
Volunteerism is highly encouraged, and 
there are many different outlets to help 
create a sense of accomplishment and 
gratification. For example, the mid
shipmen assisted the Carnegie Science 
Center in the restoration of the USS 
Requin, a World War II submarine on 
the Ohio River. The Officer Christian 
Fellowship traveled to Jamaica last 
April to assist an island missionary in 
reconstructing a church and helping an 
orphanage raise their crops. The mid
shipmen have also made several trips 
to the Veterans Administration hospi
tal in Oakland to talk and interact with 
the patients there.
Carnegie Mellon's NROTC units line up on the Cut earlier this semester.
Midshipmen are often asked by local 
communities to participate in 
celebrations. The battalion participates 
in several parades in the Pittsburgh 
area throughout the year. This past 
month, the Color Guard performed the 
opening honors at the Pittsburgh 
Steelers-New England Patriots football 
game. Midshipmen have also been 
called upon to provide funeral services 
for local sailors and Marines. The mid
shipmen that participatemtheseevents 
take great pride in extending a service 
to the community.
Professional Naval training also ex
tends into the summer vacation months. 
These summer cruises provide an 
opportunity for hands-on experience in 
the Navy and Marine Corps. The mid
shipmen travel all along the coastal 
United States, visiting ports like Nor
folk, VA; San Diego, CA; and Pearl 
Harbor, HI; as well as sailing Carib
bean, Western Pacific, Mediterranean, 
African, and Australian waters. They 
also have opportunities to navigate on 
Navy ships, fly inNavy jets, dive to the 
bottom of the ocean in a submarine, or 
experience the demanding life of an 
infantry Marine. Many midshipmen 
take part in foreign navy exchange and 
ambassador cruises. High adventure 
training includes an advanced rock 
climbing and rappelling course and a 
scuba diving school.
In addition to the stress and inten
sity of being students at Carnegie Mel
lon and the University of Pittsburgh, 
there are many additional demands 
placed on the midshipmen. Midship
men are required to take additional 
university courses like English, phys
ics, calculus, and a foreign language, 
regardless of major. There is pressure 
from naval staff to achieve academic 
excellence because so much of the
Josh Freeman/Tartan Photo Editor
midshipmens future depends on the 
quality of their grades. If a 
midshipmans quality point average 
falls below 2.0, steps are taken to sus
pend all benefits of their scholarship.
In NROTC, there are many required 
events, like physical training, summer 
cruises, and Thursday drill periods, 
that make the life of a midshipman 
very demanding. However, the battal
ion provides many opportunities for 
involvement and encourages participa
tion in club activities and voluntary 
community services. In their four years 
at Carnegie Mellon or the University of 
Pittsburgh, not only do the midship
men earn a degree in their major, they 
receive professional training to excel as 
a Naval or Marine Corps officer. Dur
ing this period, they develop strong 
leadership abilities, team spirit, and a 
sense of devotion to each other and the 
program.Army ROTC challenges wilderness
Josh Freeman/Tartan Photo Editor
A naval unit stands at attention.
By FARRON LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
For many, the Reserve Officer 
Training Corps evokes images 
of rigid rules and regulations, 
and those misperceptions, ac
cording to professor of military 
science Lieutenant Colonel 
Michael Cassetori, are what the 
program is trying to clear up. 
Army ROTCs September field 
training exercise (FIX) was open 
to non-ROTC members for just 
that reason.
There are a lot of neat things 
you can learn and neat people 
you can meet, said Cadet Cap
tain Eric Gropp, a senior civil 
engineering major. People 
imagine all we do is stand around 
in formation and do push-ups 
early in the morning, but we do 
a lot of fan and interesting things 
that wed like people to know 
about.
Despite the occasional Fall
in! for attendance and instruc
tion, and the ubiquitous usage 
of sir, interaction between 
ROTC members and their supe
riors was relaxed and familiar. 
That rigid movie kind of non
sense is a real misperception, 
said Cassetori.
There was plenty of adven
ture-type training to experi
ence. Held at Camp Dawson, 
WV, the FTX was divided into 
two sections: rappelling and 
class instruction. Halfway 
through the day, attendees 
switched sections; after rappel
ling down a 50 foot cliff, one 
could learn signalling, water pro
curement, expedient field direc
tion finding, shelter building, fire 
starting, camouflage techniques, 
grenade assault, suspension tra
versing, and CPR.
Upperclass cadets ran the en
tire FTX program. The Rangers, 
a more rigorous division of Army 
ROTC, prepared the training
site, according to senior applied 
history major and Cadet Battal
ion Executive Officer Ross 
Scheinbaum. We reconned [the 
area] the night before, spent the 
night in the woods, and the next 
morning set up the actual site. 
Other upperclassmen taught at 
the various instruction topics.
Such cadet sponsorship is a 
regular and important part of 
the ROTC program. It is all a 
part of the leadership building 
process, said Cassetori.
According to Cassetori, FTX 
introduces mountaineering and 
survival techniques to a battal
ion and [attempts] to build con
fidence and cohesion within it. 
However, because it supple
ments much of what is learned 
in ROTC classrooms, the FTX 
provided the perfect opportunity 
for non-members to get a taste 
for the ROTC program. Then, 
possibly, these people would like 
to go ahead and give us a try,
said Cassetori, stressing that 
such people would be under no 
obligation to subsequent mili
tary service, unless they took 
part in one of the scholarship 
programs.
Despite losing an official base 
at Carnegie Mellon two years 
ago due to insufficient enroll
ment and funding, a new Pittbased Army ROTC is now going 
strong, and efforts are under
way to reestablish CMUs lost 
host status, according to Major 
Robert A Murray, CMUs Army 
ROTC representative.
As for the future, Murray 
noted that the ROTC program 
will have to become more selec
tive due to a 25 percent overall 
decrease in Army personnel. We 
did our jobs so well [in the Per
sian Gulf], said the Desert 
Storm veteran, we kind of 
worked ourselves out of a job. 
Less officers will be needed to 
control and command.Other ROTC students share with Pitt

Participants in CMUs Army 
and Air Force Reserve Officer 
Training Corps face obstacles 
that are unique to them  they 
dont have on-campus training 
opportunities. Though at times 
early morning phsycal training 
at Pitt might not be everyones 
idea of fun, many people who 
participate in these programs 
^el that it is worth the extra 
work.
Eric Gropp, a senior Army 
ROTC Civil Affairs and RecruitOfficer, says he feels the 
program is training him to be a 
competent leader, a skill he 
believes would take about 10 to
5 years to develop in the pri
vate sector. While the Air Force 
and Navy are more technically 
ocused in education, Gropp said, 
ie Army is more geared toward 
eadership and management 
training.
The skills that are developed 
!n Anny ROTC are further en
hanced by the programs collabo
ration with the Pitt ROTC pro
gram. Gropp believes this situa
tion has been an advantage for 
CMU students in their leader
ship training, because there are 
many more cadets combined 
than if the schools had separate 
programs. Another advantage is 
the diversity of people working 
together. CMU students can 
work with students in majors 
not offered here, like nursing, 
an opportunity which would not 
exist if CMU and Pitt did not 
work together.
Time commitments are a ma
jor concern for CMU ROTC members, since the notorious 
workload keeps everyone busy. 
Brent Jones, a junior policy and 
management major who spent 
his freshman year in Air Force 
ROTC, agrees that keeping 
grades up is always a main goal 
at CMU, but that doesnt stop 
many people from being very 
dedicated to ROTC. He believes 
that the AFROTC has become 
an organized unit while work
ing with the Pitt program.
Underclassmen in Army
ROTC do not have time commit
ments as serious as the juniors 
and seniors that now hold offi
cer positions. Officers are con
stantly evaluated for improve
ment, which means more time 
in preparation and actioninleadership positions. Juniors and 
seniors also have PTthree times 
a week instead of once a week. 
Although PT is held at Pitt, Army 
ROTC members seem to take it 
all in stride. Gropp agreed that 
the ten minute walk was not a 
problem, especially in light of 
the advantages that working 
with Pitts program permits.
Army ROTC students see 
other, more personal benefits in 
participating in the program as 
well. Jones, although no longer 
in a ROTC program, is still very 
good friends with the people he 
met through it. Gropp believes 
that he has become more fo
cused from his ROTC training. 
He explains that ROTC does not 
try to focus members politically, 
but on what needs to be done. 
In addition, ones physical fit
ness improves after participat
ing in any ROTC program for a 
few years.
The benefits dont end after 
college, and neither does the 
commitment. ROTC graduates 
must serve either active or re
serve duty after graduation. 
Army ROTC graduates who go 
active will spend four years full
time in the service, while re
serves dedicate one weekend a 
month and two weeks a year for 
eight years to the service. 
Throughout college and the 
years of service, Gropp explains, 
there are many schools one can 
go to in order to gain and 
strengthen specific skills. For 
example, the Airborne and 
Mountain Warfare schools offer 
specialized training in those ar
eas. Management and Language 
schools provide further oppor
tunities for skill development.
Although the military offers 
the most opportunities for engi
neers, many other majors may 
develop their skills through 
ROTC. All ROTC programs em
phasize one specific quality in 
their recruits  leadership.
Parents weekend declared success
By ALISON GREEN
Tartan Kamege Editor
This weekend was Parents 
Weekend, and despite the fact 
that many people were still in 
the midst of Halloween cel
ebrations, the campus wel
comed about 560 parents, 
grandparents, and relatives 
of CMU students. This years 
program was the first of its 
kind; unlike past years, in 
which only parents of fresh
men were invited to the event, 
all parents of undergraduate 
students were invited.
Assistantto the Dean ofStudent Affairs Lisa Lipscomb 
coordinated the activities for 
the weekend. She describes 
the idea of inviting the par
ents of all undergraduates as 
a good thing. According to 
Lipscomb, about 300 people 
attended Freshman Parents 
Day last year. She said that
with the Parents Weekend 
program, theres a diversity 
of parents [of students from 
different classes and years.] 
While planning the week
end, Lipscomb tried a few new 
ideas. One change is that the 
activities started on Friday. 
[Parents Weekend is] a 
chance to come and see stu
dents on a Friday, going to 
class ... a mix of everything, 
said Lipscomb last Friday, as 
the weekend was just getting 
started. The response to the 
early start of the weekend was 
more than favorable, accord
ing to Lipscomb. We didnt 
anticipate so many parents 
sending an RSVP to come on 
Friday, she said, We have 
about 245 families coming. 
Parents Weekend included 
a large number of activities 
that werent a part of Fresh

NO CHOLESTEROL
Kris Parker urges campus to
By TRINETTE CHANDLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Kris Parker, otherwise known as KRSOne of Boogie Down Productions, will 
present a talk entitled Stop the Vio
lence tonight at 8 pm in Skibo Ball
room. Hailed as the conscience of rap 
and its leading activist by Rolling 
Stone magazine, Parker will discuss 
his latest project, HEAL (Human Edu
cation Against Lies), and other socio
political issues. Known to many as The 
Teacher, all his LPs have passed the 
gold mark (500,000 sold). Parker 
granted The Tartan a rare telephone 
interview, a portion of which follows:
Q: How did you get your start in rap 
and who were your major influences?
A: One day I opened up the refrigera
tor and it was empty, so I picked up the 
microphone. No, really I started rap
ping because I had a message that 
people needed to hear. I joined Scott La 
Rock and put out my first LP Criminal 
Minded. Then I entered a transition 
period after the death of Scott La Rock. 
My music changed from ghetto-style 
rap to intelligent rap. Basically, I feel 
that you cannot be a good record maker 
if you do nothing to uplift humanity.
Q: In one ofthe many articles written 
about you, you are quoted as saying 
that we are living in an uncivilized 
society. Wouldyou explain that, please?
A: When I say that our society is 
uncivilized, I mean that we are killing 
and destroying each other. We, as a 
society, are barbaric. When you turn on 
the news, what do you see? You see 
kidnap, rape, lies, and murder. As a 
matter of fact, that is what this country 
is all about from a social aspect, and if 
you look at it from an economic aspect, 
it is nothing but pimps and hoes, buy
ing and selling each other.
Q: What, in your opinion, are some of 
the prevalent problems facing the black 
community today?
A: First of all, we have forgotten the 
fact that we are African, just like Euro
peans have forgotten the fact that they 
are Europeans, [and] Asians have for
gotten the fact that they are Asians. 
Let me say this: if you forgot where you 
just came from before you came to your 
dorm, be it the library, the cafeteria, 
class, etc.; if you forgot everything, then 
where are you going after you finish 
speaking to me?
In other words, if you dont remember 
where you were, when it comes time to 
leave, you wont want to leave [because 
you wont know where to go]... So that 
is the number one problem facing black 
people today. We dont know where we 
are from. Another problem that we, as 
a society, sometimes suffer from is
C.S.D.S.
Q: What is that?
A: Common Sense Deficiency Syn
drome. It is the number-one killer right 
now! Matter of fact, let me give you an 
example, okay? You have five senses 
right? Touch, smell, taste, sight, hear
ing. What about common sense? What 
happened to that?
Q: Well, you know the old saying that 
it doesnt matter how smart you are  
if you dont have common sense, you 
can forget it.
A: Common sense is the most impor
tant of all, because it is your common 
sense that keeps all of your other senses 
in check. Now, when you lose your com
mon sense, the rest of your other senses 
absolutely go haywire. Take for instance 
sex. Now, you know that the purpose of 
sex is to have children. You have a 
sexual urge, which is your procreation 
urge. Now what happens when sex is 
just sex? Procreation then becomes rec
reation. And when procreation becomes
recreation, then sex is just fun. You can 
then have sex with anybody, or any
thing, hypothetically speaking. You can 
have man on man, woman on woman, 
man to animal, or woman to animal. So 
basically, it doesnt matter what you 
are having sex with. After you take the 
procreation part out, it all lacks com
mon sense.
Heres another example. Did you 
know that Michael Jordan descends 
from a tribe in Africa that uses running 
and jumping skills as hunting tech
niques? Did you know that?
Q: No, I didnt know that.
A: The reason you didnt know that is 
because it is a lie. But you will believe 
it because you are talking to KRS-One. 
See! This is how we are taught every
day. We believe that the teacher is 
definitely teaching us the truth, when 
in fact the teacher is teaching us lies. 
For instance, we all know that Christo
pher Columbus didnt discover America, 
but in order to pass your class, youre 
going to put down that he did.
Q: Are you an advocate of Garveyism? 
[Marcus Garvey advocated a back to 
Africa movement during the 1920s.]
A: Yes. Garvey hit on different as
pects of going back to Africa. For in
stance, he hit on the physical one, by 
actually saying that we got a boat, and 
were outta here. I think black people 
need to start thinking about heading 
back towards Africa. But the problem 
with that now is that Africa is not run 
by Africans. The CIA  Criminals In 
Action  goes in there and kills presi
dents and leaders infiltrate their reigns. 
It is like neocolonialism. They set up 
colonies throughout Africa, like they 
had the first 13 colonies here. They 
basically colonized Africa.
Actually, if you think about it, South 
Africa is really the whole of Africa. You 
have leaders there that the CIA call
HEAL itself tonight
terrorists, just like they called Qaddafi 
and Saddam Hussein terrorists, when 
in a matter of fact they are just trying 
to take their land. Thats just like some
one trying to take your shoes. Youre 
going to be like What are you doing? 
and if you can beat that person down, 
youll beat them down in order to keep 
your shoes.
Q:You supportmany respected move
ments like Stop the Violence, which 
brought national attention to the plague 
of black on black crime. You are now 
involved with the HEAL Yourself (Hu
man Education Against Lies) project. 
Can you tell me a little bit more about 
HEAL? What lies are you trying to 
fight?
A: I basically am advocating that 
before you are a race, an occupation, or 
a religion, you are a human being. Most 
people have been cheated out of their 
humanity to become a color, religion, or 
job. So what HEAL does is, or what 
HEAL is doing, is devoting itself to 
consciousness. We just put out a book 
called Civilization vs. Technology, which 
will be free to the public. Basically, 
HEAL is a nonprofit organization dedi
cated to raising the consciousness of 
America. This is done through educa
tion. And, because we feel education 
should be free.we are making the books 
free to the public.
Q: You are called the conscience of 
rap. Do you feel that that title gets too 
heavy to bear at times? How do you feel 
about rappers who dont feel they should 
act as role models to their fans?
A: Well, they are not being all that 
they can be, and they are not teaching 
the essentials, but that is their decision 
to say if they want to be a role model or 
not. I think a lot of rappers are histori
cally incorrect. I think that if you could 
feel your mother being whipped and 
her baby being cut out of her stomach
while she is being called bitch and 
whore, then why would you want to 
call yourself Bitch with a Problem? 
[This is the name of a female rap group.] 
But they dont have any history so it i8 
cool, whatever. You can call yourself 
whatever you want to call yourself 
Hoes with Attitudes, you know? Com., 
mon sense would tell you that if y0ll 
bought a hoe ... she better not have no 
attitude. Who wants a hoe with an 
attitude?
Q: What will be the focus of yoUr 
lecture?
A: HEAL Yourself. It will talk of 
HEAL as an organization. Your is to 
whom the healing is applied, and self! 
means to find a place for your self in 
this world, and in this universe.
Those associated with the CMU com
munity without reserved tickets will be 
allowed at the door tonight as space, 
permits.
KRS-One of Boogie Down Productions 
By MICHAEL COLAIANNE
Tartan Staffwriter
He smiles knowingly when I 
tell him he is referred to as Doc 
Pottie. As the new kid on the 
area coordinators block, and the 
only one with a doctorate, Dave 
Potter has had to put up with 
some friendly teasing on the part 
of his co-workers. Im not big on 
titles. Id rather be known as 
Dave.
Potter, the new Housing Area 
Coordinator for the Eastside 
residence halls, has an unusual 
and interesting background. He 
received a bachelors degree in 
psychology, a masters degree in 
educational administration, and 
a PhD as part of a self-designed 
physical education program  
all of which leads me to the in
evitable question: what is a guy 
with a doctorate in physical edu
cation doing as an area coordi
nator at Carnegie Mellon?
I expected to find some flaw in 
Potters character or background 
in my search for an answer. I 
thought, Wow, there has got to 
be something wrong with this 
guy. Believe me, I tried, but I 
couldnt find anything. I talked 
with his boss. I talked to RAs. I 
even talked with a couple of resi
dents, and nobody had anything 
bad to say about him.
He began his education at 
Bucknell, where he earned a 
degree in psychology. Interested 
in teaching, he took time out to 
teach history to high school jun
iors and seniors at the Hun
School in Princeton, N.J.
Feeling that he wasnt getting 
the fulfillment from teaching 
that he thought he would, Pot
ter returned to school at 
Teachers College at Columbia 
University, where he earned a 
masters degree in educational 
administration. Soon after this, 
he decided to pursue an interest 
in sports and coaching and en
tered a doctorate program in 
physical education at Ohio State 
University.
Potter designed his own pro
gram at Ohio State, the final 
result being a dissertation en
titled Peer Observation and Re
flection: a Strategy for Collegial 
Interaction Among Teachers, a 
look at networking in an educa
tional environment.
It was during his four years at 
Ohio State that he became in
terested in student affairs and 
dealing with the broad scope of 
student issues at college. When 
he found out about the area co
ordinator opening at Carnegie 
Mellon, he applied and eventu
ally got the job.
I was impressed [by Potter] 
then, and Im impressed now, 
says Anthony Martin, director 
of Housing. Potter was Housings 
top choice for an open area coor
dinator position, a position that 
Martin refers to as the key link
Dan Frey/Tartan Photo Staff Manager 
Dave Potter, Eastside area coordinator, sitting in his office.
in the management of residence 
halls.
Area coordinators are to orga
nize and supervise resident as
sistants (usually 15-20 students 
per coordinator), as well as offer 
them support and direction in 
their residence duties. Its apro
active position, says Martin. 
Each area coordinator should 
get to know their RAs residents 
as well and make their pres
ence felt in [their] particular part
of campus.
Potter believes he is still in 
the process of learning the na
ture and demands of his job as a 
contributor to students educa
tion outside of the classroom. 
Im not sure yet how to best 
direct my energies, he says. 
There are many areas, and I 
am still trying to establish a 
sense of balance in determining 
where to best address the needs 
of residents.
How does Potter see these 
needs? He likes the energy and 
seriousness that students have 
in pursuing their studies at Car
negie Mellon, and he is im
mensely impressed with the 
quality of people here.
However, he is concerned with 
what he calls the skewed nature 
of students perceptions of col
lege, especially at Carnegie Mel
lon. Its too one-sided. Students 
here focus almost exclusively on 
academic pursuits. Potter finds 
it intriguing that Carnegie Mel
lon students compare the rigor
ousness of their own academic 
programs to that of others. Its 
an area worthy of attention, he 
says.
I asked Potter what he would 
most like to tell students, to help 
them avoid some of the difficul
ties he has had in his own life. 
He tells me that he took a lot of 
time determining what he 
wanted to do professionally, and 
how he could best match his 
interests with a career.
I asked myself, Who am I? I 
think that Carnegie Mellon stu
dents tend to make such deci
sions very early and dont ask 
themselves that question as 
much as they should. Its healthy 
to affirm that what you are pur
suing educationally is congru
ent with who you are and what
you want to do.
Coming from a man who has 
done just that, and who seems to 
be happy with what he is doing 
right now, these words sound 
like good advice. Hes pretty con
vincing in person, I might add, i 
as well as friendly, open, and 
honest in addressing most ev! 
eryone he sees.
I kept looking for someone who .; 
could tell me something bad 
about Potter. The best I could , 
come up with is someone who 
said, Hes got kind of a high 
voice for a guy who looks like he 
does. Not much of a criticism, 
Ill admit, but the fact that this 
is the only not good thing any
one has had to say about him, 
says something about Potter.
He has, in his two-and-a-half 
months here, made a good first 
impression on most ofthe people, 
he has come in contact with.
If Potter continues to address < 
the areas of student life he is-' 
genuinely concerned about, he  
should make a lasting impres-3 
sion on residence life at Carn
egie Mellon. This would be no 
small feat for a nice guy in an. 
environment where most of the 
students, when asked about resi-,, 
dence life, think only of the bad.j 
food and poor response time on - 
the part of Housing Mainte-; 
nance.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  4 November 1991L3
Rate your laziness quotient before touring Schenley
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Junior Staf/writer
If you want to find something to do, 
but are acutely aware of your own sheer 
laziness, dont despair, there is always 
gchenley Park. This wonderful fringe 
benefit of attending CMU is right in our 
offn backyard, and provides several 
boredom cures within five minutes of 
campus, so you dont have to go very far 
or strain yourself for a change of pace.
However, to take advantage of this 
rarity on college campuses, you have to 
do something first. You have to deterffline exactly how lazy you are. If this 
task seems to be too much of an effort, 
dont even bother getting out of bed, let 
alone trying to go farther than your 
room door. Call someone (the telephone, 
if you are truly a lazy person, is right 
next to your bed) and have them bring 
over a map of the park. Take a look at 
it just before you fall asleep and youll 
probably dream about it. Theres no 
effort here at all. Of course, what you 
dream might not be the real thing....
If youre not quite this lazy, youve 
g6ne through the trouble of determinjrigyour actual laziness then were ready 
to go. Find the handy subheading that
If this task seems to 
be too much of an 
effort, don't even 
bother to get out of 
bed..._____________
reflects your approximate laziness quo
tient.
Immobile, but not comatose
If reading this article is proving to be 
too taxing, then call a friend and have 
him or her get a map of the park for you. 
Look at it, and read the rest of this 
article. Pretend you did everything that 
was suggested.
Lethargic 
Carnegie Mellon was built on a grant 
of land from the City of Pittsburgh, so 
CMU was once part of Schenley Park. 
Go out and lay in the grass between 
Doherty and Porter/Baker and watch 
people go by, pretending that things 
were like they usedtobebefore Andrew 
Carnegie and Henry Hombostle went 
crazy. Bring a pillow if necessary. 
Just Plain Lazy 
Flagstaff Hill is just on the other side 
of Porter/Baker. In nice weather (or
really crappy weather too, though its 
not quite the same under an umbrella) 
you can do a variety of things. The 
choices are ordered from least to most 
activity required.
1. Bring a blanket and some sun tan 
lotion (what am I thinking?  this is 
Pittsburgh!) and just veg.
2. Add books to the above item.
3. Actually read the books.
4. Go to Flagstaff and watch one of 
the performances or movies shown on 
the outdoor stage. (This includes those 
people who decide to have their wed
ding pictures taken with the squirrels.)
5. Bring a frisbee, kite, football, or 
other athletic apparatus and a few 
friends and play something.
Slightly Motivated
Phipps Conservatory sits at the bot
tom of Flagstaff Hill. Its that glass 
building that you always wondered 
about. Inside Phipps there are 13 dif
ferent rooms with different flora in each 
one. Theres also the Outdoor Garden, 
the Aquatic Gardens, and Botany Hall. 
Phipps is beautiful, but it costs money 
to get in ($3) and to get a tour. 
Motivated
Just beyond Flagstaff, there are miles 
of biking, hiking, and jogging trails
snaking throughout the park. They all 
meet one another somewhere along the 
way. You can walk for an hour or all 
afternoon. Take your pick.
Really Motivated
Beyond Flagstaff, Phipps, and the 
hiking trails, there are some seasonal 
facilities in Schenley. If you go over 
Panther Hollow Bridge, you come to 
Schenley Pool, open during the sum
mer months after 1 pm Going up Over
look Road, youll eventually reach the 
Schenley Ice Rink. If you like to skate, 
its a great opportunity, but sometimes 
it looks like all the kids who usually 
hang out at the mall moved over to the 
rink for the night. Farther up Overlook 
Road, there is the Disc Golf Course, as 
well as tennis courts, a track, soccer 
fields, and baseball diamonds. There is 
also the Schenley Golf Course on 
Schenley Drive for all you golfer types.
Beware, all of the Really Motivated 
activities cost money. Not too much, 
mind you, but a few dollars each. They 
are also not for the Just Plain Lazy 
and below. Most of them are at least a 
five minute walk from campus and re
quire at least a small bit of enthusiasm. 
If you dont have the enthusiasm or a 
couple bucks, forget it. If you do, bring
a couple of friends, and youll have a 
great time.
If youve gotten to this point in the 
article, you are probably at least 
Slightly Motivated. So, pick up that 
telephone which youve positioned stra
tegically next to your pillow, call a few 
friends, and get out of bed. You know 
you dont really need to sleep that much.
Dont get mad, just steal your neighbors New York Times
Enough was enough! I just 
couldnt take it anymore! I was 
going to get back at that idiot 
neighbor if it was the last thing 
I was going to do!
Oh sure, it all started out in
nocently enough  buying a 
subscription to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette and having it deliyered to my door every morn
ing. Well, at least that was the 
theory, because my paper never 
made it past the ground floor. It 
must be against the religion of 
my paper carrier or something 
to deliver a paper to the third 
floor of an apartment building, 
because even after a month of 
constant complaining, my morn
ing paper never made it past the 
front step.
Over time I even began look
ing forward to reading my PostGazette at places other than the 
breakfast table (that very inter
esting paper just made my dull 
morning class fly by for some 
unknown reason). However, 
little did I know that my struggle 
for a morning paper was just 
beginning....
I remember that September 
morning like it was yesterday... 
the birds were chirping, it was a 
little cold out, I was late (again) 
for my morning class, when I 
discovered something which put
chill in my heart  my morn
ing paper was missing!
Okay, I thought calmly to 
myself, no need to panic here; 
after all, its only a newspaper.
LIFE; THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
Of course, I was kidding myself, 
for that paper was my link to the 
outside world. Without it, I might 
as well be an average college 
student! I know, Ill look around. 
Yeah, thats it! Maybe the car
rier just threw it in the bushes 
or something! But after five 
minutes of fruitless searching 
for my missing paper, I had to 
face the facts ... my newspaper 
was gone.
I sat throughmy morning class 
going over the problem in my 
head over and over again. Sure, 
my carrier seemed to have some
thing against stairs, but he never 
forgot to deliver the paper. Could 
someone have actually taken it? 
I contemplated. Nah, this is 
Pittsburgh, people dont steal 
other peoples papers in Pitts
burgh, especially notin Squirrel 
Hill. My carrier just must have 
forgotten to deliver the paper. 
Yeah, thats it! That must be it!
But the next day my paper 
was missing, and the next day, 
and the next.... The newspaper
office said that the carrier was 
delivering my paper, but then 
why wasnt I receiving it? After 
a week of being paperless, I fi
nally decided to face the ugly 
truth, someone was taking my 
morning paper.
But who? was the big ques
tion. Who on earth would be 
taking my paper every morn
ing? How was I going to catch 
him (or her)? What was I going 
to do once I did catch the hooli
gan? I had no answers.
This continued for over a 
month, having my paper stolen, 
but once in a while, whenever I 
got up really early, I did manage 
to get my paper. And after about 
five times of beating that bandit 
to my paper, I began to notice a 
trend....
Whenever my paper was still 
on the front step, so was my 
neighbors New York Times (it 
seemed that his carrier followed 
the same religion). But when
ever my paper was missing, so 
was my neighbors. Mere coinci
dence? I think not.
First, I wrote a note asking 
whoever was taking my paper to 
please stop, but that didnt work. 
My paper was still gone the next 
three mornings. I had to take 
more drastic measures. After all, 
this guy has been taking my 
paper for almost two months 
now, so when I got back at him it 
had to be good ... real good.
By complete chance the very 
next day, a Thursday, I was up
very late studying for a big test, 
and at around 6 am I decided to 
take a little break and read my 
morning paper. I went down
stairs, picked up my paper, and 
started back in, but some un
known force was holding me 
back.
Take it! Take it! the force was 
saying to me. Take his paper! 
Make him pay! There it was, 
right next to my feet, wrapped 
in blue plastic  my neighbors 
New York Times. Almost invol
untarily my hand took hold of 
that Times and I began running 
up the stairs.
Only once I was safely back in 
my apartment did I fully con
template what I had just done. 
I just took my neighbors pa
per, I thought, and hes just 
going to know that I did it. But 
I still clutched onto that paper, 
knowing that today my neigh
bor would know what it was like 
to not only go paperless, but to 
know that your paper was sto
len. My conversion from guilt to 
devilish excitement took a whole 
two minutes.
The next morning I was up 
early again and took both pa
pers. I could tell that my neigh
bor wasnt enjoying my little 
escapade because when I came 
home later that night, in front of 
his apartment door (his carrier 
must have converted to another 
religion) was Thursdays and 
Fridays Times with an apology 
note attached. I thought about
not taking those papers for about 
two millionths of a second, and 
then scooped them both up in 
one hand.
Again, on my way to buggy the 
next morning, I took his paper, 
but the next morning was when 
I performed the coupe degrace....
I took his Sunday New York 
Times!
After that unspeakable act I 
knew I probably went too far, 
but I didnt care. I wanted him to 
pay!
Monday morning I got up fairly 
late, thereby missing my oppor
tunity to yet again snatch my 
neighbors paper. Oh well, I 
thought, theres always tomor
row. I left my apartment, didnt 
see his paper, which I expected, 
went downstairs while thinking 
about taking his paper tomor
row. But before I could complete 
my thoughts, something inter
rupted me.
There, on the front step, there
it was ... my morning paper. I 
had just won the Great Newspa
per War.
Its been over a week now, and 
every day Ive thoroughly en
joyed picking up my morning 
paper. Every once in a while I 
see my neighbors paper, but now
I just leave it alone, knowing 
that if I ever needed to, I can 
start taking his paper as easily 
as he was taking mine. It just 
goes to show you not that crime 
doesnt pay (because it does), 
but if youre going to do some
thing which is going to hurt 
someone else, think before you 
do it. That person just might 
choose to do the same to you.
Or even worse ... I could be 
your next door neighbor.

Students display talent for parents
WEEKEND, from LI
Citibus tours of Pittsburgh and 
Station Square programs, which 
were offered to the parents and 
relatives free of charge. We 
wanted to do things to let them 
see Pittsburgh too, said 
Lipscomb. Its a good opportu
nity to see where Carnegie Mel
lon is. Among the campus ac
tivities that were new this year 
was the Gala of Student Talent, 
which took place Saturday night 
in the Wherrett Room from 8^10 
pm.
The Gala was coordinated by 
Mne Witchner, director of Stu
dent Activities and assistant 
Jean of Student Affairs, and Lisa 
Lane, associate director of Spe
cial Events. Students were asked 
to audition for the show and on
Saturday night, they performed 
for an audience of about 300 
people.
[Lane] and I volunteered to 
organize the talent show, said 
Witchner. It was really easy to 
get the students to do it, and it 
was fun. Lane added that they 
accepted every act we pre
viewed, and described the show 
as excellent.
We wanted to showcase the 
fact that... we know from other 
talent shows that there are stu
dents from other colleges that 
are talented, said Witchner. 
Students from various colleges 
performed in the show, which 
included performances by the 
Dancers Symposium and the 
Ballroom Dancing Club, and stu
dents performing their own com
positions.
I think most of the things we 
tested [this year] are working, 
said Lipscomb. According to her, 
the weekend involved people 
from all over campus  differ
ent colleges and departments. 
She hopes that in the future, 
students will become more of a 
part of Parents Weekend.
Next year, Id like to involve 
students more as well as par
ents in the planning, said 
Lipscomb. The Parents Day reg
istration packets included evalu
ation sheets, so that parents 
could make comments on this 
years weekend that would im
prove next years planning and 
events. After this year, we will 
have a lot of perspectives on how 
this worked, said Lipscomb.

New Science Center offers many 
exciting and educational exhibits
By MARNIBOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Malls and movies became a social 
ritual of the past with the recent open
ing of the Carnegie Science Center. 
With exhibits on topics ranging from 
the human body to computers, the Cen
ter caters to all types of crowds. The 
new attraction is only a bus ride away 
and is reasonably priced, with tickets 
ranging from $5.50 to $11, depending 
on how much of the Center one wishes 
to view. The An Amusement Park for 
the Mind logo is appropriate for de
scribing the Centers varied exhibits; 
curious visitors get on a rollercoaster 
with questions and with every drop and 
turn their answers are found.
Below is a descriptive list of the high
lights of this exciting new center:
Ground Floor
Rangos Omnimax Theater: For
get about the movie theaters at 
Monroeville and Squirrel Hill  all 
they have compared to the Omnimax is 
popcorn. The enormous theater with 
its parabolic screen, sloped seats, and 
sixty-four speakers makes an audience 
feel as if they are actually part of the 
film. When the skier onscreen crashes 
into a wall, so does the audience. When 
the rock climber on screen loses grip, 
the audience plunges several hundred 
feet with him. When the male dancer 
does his flying leap in a performance of 
Don Quixote, the audience lands with 
him. Films like Star Wars, Indiana 
Jones, and Terminator 2 were destined 
to be viewed in a theater like this.
First Floor
Body Tech: This exhibit on the 
wonders of the human body is located 
in the Centers Atrium Gallery, which 
is open to the public free of admission. 
Most of the displays are hands-on and 
informative. Exhibit highlights include:
The World Within You  The mag
nificent glossy wall photos show con
ventional pictures of arteries, red blood 
cells, lungs, and the linings of the small 
and large intestines. Many of us have
seen these items in our eighth grade 
biology books, but can we identify the 
photos without those biology book cap
tions? The wall photos in the exhibit 
give Center visitors a chance to label 
parts of their interiors, and after tak
ing several wild guesses, they can find 
correct answers can be found under
neath a wall panel.
Looking Into the Knee  The won
ders of modern medical equipment are 
presented in a simple way in this dis
play. By looking through a lens eye
piece, one can see the inside of the knee 
and vary the areas on which to focus. 
The lens eyepiece represents the 
arthroscope, a tiny lighted microscope 
which allows medical experts to exam
ine certain parts of the inner body 
without making any incision.
Shaping SoundBy using vacuum 
hoses and plugging them into special 
pieces of plastic, certain sounds are 
produced. The soiinds produced, like 
eee and aah, have different 
soundwaves that are displayed on a 
mini oscilloscope  a computer that 
monitors soundwaves.
Science Way: This humorous ex
hibit teases our minds with seemingly 
simple everday items. A feature of ev
ery object is altered or exaggerated in 
some way.
In the middle of the main display 
room theres a plain blue mailbox which, 
from time to time, makes remarks like 
hey babe or help, Im trapped. At 
this point, Center visitors may feel con
fused. After entering another room 
where several people are gathered in 
front of a monitor and microphone, the 
situation becomes clearer. These cul
prits are the voice of the mailbox. Its 
easy to know how the Wizard of Oz felt 
when Dorothy found him to be a mere 
Kansas man!
The Spin Cycle exhibit demon
strates centripetal force. It is similar to 
the childhood toy Sit and Spin  ex
cept the user stands up. Hooked up to 
the exhibit is an audio cassette. If the 
user spins at a constant speed he/she 
will hear the Chipmunks version of 
Elvis Costellos Veronica. If the speed 
is slowed down the user hears the voice 
of Bowser from Sha Na Na.
Second Floor
 Special Exhibitions Gallery: The
theme of the exhibits now being shown 
on this level is sports. For all those 
baseball, running, skiing, and bobsled
ding fans there is plenty to play with. 
Be forewarned thoughthese are fam
ily funfest exhibits. The lines for some 
of the hands on displays are long and 
wearisome. Here are the best of the 
displays:
Make Your Pitch  This is the basic 
see how far and fast you can throw a 
baseball exhibit. The pitcher stands 
on a plaster mound and throws the ball 
towards a net. A computer near the net 
registers the speed of the ball. The only 
problems with this display are the long 
lines and the annoying fact that one 
must have to chase down the ball if it is 
thrown or rolled out of the area.
Simulated Bobsled Ride  Imagine 
riding the snowy/icy slopes in a small 
cramped vehicle. The simulated bobsled 
ride gives Center visitors that taste of 
the winter sport, fully equipped with 
the winter wind. There is a two person 
limit in the bobsled, but once seated, 
riders are confronted with a screen of 
winter scenery. Using the controls in 
the front of the bobsled, the driver is 
able to swerve obstacles.
Speed Test  The feel of a real track 
is what makes this display so attrac
tive. A strip of a track is set up com
plete with starting line and a cheering 
crowd. On the side of the track are large 
images of a woman runner in different 
running stages. When the computer
ized voice yells Go, the runner at the 
starting line races lighted up images of 
the woman to the finish line. Of course 
the image will most likely win ever 
time, but the aim of the exhibit is for 
visitors to test their speed to the limits.
Grab a Piece of Rock  Yes, there is 
now rock climbing for those who are 
scared of heights and loathe the out
doors. A large fake mountain piece with 
several carved out grooves allows for 
people of all ages to climb to their hearts 
content. It is hard to pull ones body 
weight up at first, but once the initial 
climb is done there is no problem reachPlease see CENTER, page LI2

What exactly is quality tele
vision?
Critics everywhere praise it, 
everyone supposedly longs to see 
it, and no one is ashamed to say 
that he or she watches it. It is 
held up as a lone beacon of hope 
for the future of television, 
maybe even humankind. But 
what is it? Well, the quality 
program usually seems to boast 
most of these characteristics:
(1) Its never a dumb family 
sitcom, and it doesnt have a 
laugh track (exception: Cheers).
(2) Critics everywhere love it.
(3) Nobody watches it, but ev
erybody wants to.
Its true: to be considered a 
quality program, it must flop 
at first. Cheers took two years to 
catch on. Northern Exposure 
opened to lukewarm ratings be
fore moving to Monday nights. 
St. Elsewhere limped along for 
five years without huge ratings 
success. A lot more people talked 
about Twin Peaks than actually 
watched it. Only after a period 
of disappointing ratings and talk 
of cancellation are quality shows 
allowed to find an audience.
Thats right, I said allowed. 
This initial failure is not always 
coincidental. I think the net
works choose which shows will 
be quality. Once they figure 
out which show the critics will 
love (and the advertisers will 
eventually pay for), they stick 
this unfortunate program in an 
impossible time slot, guarantee
ing lousy ratings.
This theory may seem a little 
skewed, but think about it. The 
networks know that quality 
television will always get a lot 
of media attention. Such a show 
probably has a better chance of 
succeeding in a killer time slot 
than any other program.
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
It has worked before: The 
Simpsons has fit in comfortably 
into a Thursday slot against The 
Cosby Show; Twin Peaks held 
its own opposite Cheers until 
ABC relegated it to Saturday; 
thirty something survived four 
years in a tough slot.
But more often than not, the 
gamble is unsuccessful. The 
quality program is then either 
moved to a better time slot, 
where it finds its audience, or 
pulled from the schedule for
ever, the unfortunate victim of 
network greed.
Based on the three criteria 
outlined above, there are three 
new shows on the air which 
qualify as quality television: 
Brooklyn Bridge, Ill Fly Away, 
and Eerie, Indiana.
First off, they are not dumb 
sitcoms. Secondly, I (the critic) 
enjoy them immensely, and I 
will not hesitate to lavish praise 
on them. And, if that isnt 
enough, all three are struggling 
to survive in tough, if not impos
sible, time slots.
Take Brooklyn Bridge (Wed
nesday at 8 pm on KDKA-2). 
This slice-of-life comedy-drama 
from producer Gary David 
Goldberg is unquestionably one 
of the most enjoyable half-hours 
on television.
Danny Gerard plays the cen
tral character, a boy growing up 
in 1950s Brooklyn with his Jew
ish family. Gerard is a natural, 
completely at home in his role as 
a young man growing up in a 
time of change, simultaneously 
honoring and questioning tradi
tions and values.
Gerard is only one of the many 
bright spots, though. Young 
Matthew Louis Siegel is the 
quintessential annoying little 
brother, and Marion Ross (Richie 
Cunninghams mom) is perfect 
as the boys loving but strict 
grandmother.
This show is funny, touching, 
and real. Brooklyn Bridge is 
based on Goldbergs childhood, 
and the time and thought that 
he put into this project is easy to 
see. Goldberg even had his 
familys apartment recon
structed on the set. No detail is 
missing.
Brooklyn Bridge is wonderful 
to watch. Its hard to resist the 
pleasures and the fond memo
ries this family offers. Brooklyn 
Bridge is a labor of love, and it 
shows.
Of course, CBS stuck this ea
gerly anticipated show on Fri
day night, after the stillborn 
comedy Princesses and opposite 
ABCs newest powerhouse, Step 
by Step (you know, the Brady 
Bunch ripoff with Patrick Duffy 
and Suzanne Somers ... sigh). 
After a few weeks of almost non
existent ratings, CBS has moved 
Brooklyn Bridge to a Wednes
day time slot, where its chances 
of succeeding are slightly bet
ter.
Ill Fly Away (Tuesday at 8 pm 
on WPXI-11) is in a similar situ
ation. This is a nice-looking, if 
slow, little drama set in the late 
1950s. Sam Waterston is a lib
eral Southern attorney whose 
wife has been sent to a mental 
institution. He raises his three

Its true: to be considered a quality 
program, it must flop at first
children with the help of his 
black housekeeper, played by 
Regina Taylor.
Race is an ever-present issue 
in this program. Waterstons 
character, of course, fights rac
ism in court. But this seems sec
ondary to the interactions be
tween individual characters.
Each episode opens and closes 
with narration from Taylors 
character, and the most inter
esting part of the show is watch
ing her try to balance her job 
with her home life. John Aaron 
Bennett is simply wonderful as 
Waterstons youngest son. The 
boy, who adores Taylor and 
barely knows his mother, doesnt 
understand Taylors role in his 
life, or her desire to be with her 
own family. The tension this cre
ates is incredible.
Ill Fly Away has a slow pace, 
and it will take quite a while to 
catch on. So far it has not fared 
well against ABC and the Full 
House juggernaut. Given time, 
it might find a niche. Chances 
are, though, that Til Fly Away 
will take a dive before seasons 
end.
The third new quality pro
gram is Eerie, Indiana (Sunday 
at 7:30 pm on WPXI-11). This 
horror/comedy, about the expe
riences of a normal boy in a very 
abnormal town, is a mishmash 
of genres and stories that some
how turns out to be quite enter
taining.
Omri Katz portrays Marshall, 
who, with a young fnend, uncov
ers weirder and weirder goingson in Eerie each week. Among
their discoveries thus far are a 
woman who vacuum-seals her 
sons to keep them young, a group 
of dogs bent on defeating hu
mans, and a school nurse who 
makes lifeless zombies out of 
students with her special eye 
exams.
The concept is great, and its 
backed up by top-rate produc
tion and imaginative writing. 
Its weird, wacky, and lots o fun.
The trouble is that Eerie, Indi
ana is mired in the absolute 
worst time slot on network tele
vision. Not only must it follow 
the worst new show of the sea
son, The Adventures of Mark & 
Brian, but it must also take on 
60 Minutes, Life Goes On, and 
perhaps worst of all  Parker
Lewis Can't Lose, a show which 
is obviously going after (and get. 
ting) the same young audience 
Eerie is striving for. By Deceit 
ber, Eerie will either be moved 
or gone, most likely the latter.
These three quality shows 
may not have much longer to 
live; their fate is largely in the 
networks hands. The most I can 
do is draw attention to them a 
urge everyone to watch them 
while theyre still on. Not in some 
inane attempt to improve their 
ratings; Im well aware of the 
college students lack of in% 
ence in the current ratings s 
tems.
No, I urge you to watch them 
for your own sake. These are 
good shows, and they probably 
wont be on much longer. Catch 
them while you can.

Early Orson: The Years 
Before Citizen Kane
3:30 p.m. 
Tuesday, November 12 
Wherrett Room, Skibo Hall
Citizen Kane was written and previewed before Orson Welles was 26 years of age. Such has been the success of Citizen Kane. that it has overshadowed all his preceding work in radio and theater. Yet, the Orson Welles 1937 production of Julius Caesar is still regarded as the most outstanding Shakespearean stage production in the history of American theater, and with War of the Worlds, Welles revolutionized radio drama. Richard France will present the seven years between 1934 to 1941 culminating in Citizen Kane during which Welles established himself as a seminal figure in radio, theater and films.
Richard France, Ph.D. in Theatre History, 1973, (CMU) and M.F.A. in Play writing, 1970, (CMU), has produced or published 16 plays, among them Station J, winner of the 1982 Silver PEN Award for Play writing, The Image of Elmo Doyle, contained in The Best Short Plays of 1979 and the dramatization 
of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. His plays have been produced in London, Berlin, Tokyo and Amsterdam, as well as such American cities as Dallas, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. He has received major grants from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as two NEA Creative Writing Prizes.

Sterns Crucified provides a pleasant shock
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Sports Editor
Shock radio. You may love it, 
you may hate it, but you have to 
deal with it because its every
where these days. City to city, 
all over the dial, the radio rat
ings war is won or lost on the 
ability to make people notice you, 
however you do it.
However, there is only one true 
king of the shock jocks  
Howard Stem. Currently the 
morning DJ for New Yorks KRock, Stem is probably the most 
infamous name in shock radio. 
And he could be coming to your 
home (if you invite him).
Stem has just released Cruci
fied By the FCC, a combination 
retrospective/protest which con
tains two CDs of Stems very 
best material, in its original 
uncensored form. Due to the con
troversial nature of the mate
rial on Crucified, its not being 
released in stores; if youre in
terested, you have to mail away 
for it. Between my vehement 
First Amendment support and 
my taste for off-color humor, I 
could weather the Stem bar Record Review

rage well, but other listeners 
may have trouble stomaching 
the nature of Stems comedy.
Contained in the discs is a 
treasure trove of material rang
ing from standard shock radio 
crank calls and fake ads to ce
lebrity interviews (the on-air 
battle between Sam Kinison and 
Jessica Hahn is arguably the 
high point of either disc) to the 
arguably obscene. The prime 
example in this last category is a 
montage of highlights from 
Sterns 88 Christmas party 
broadcast, which is currently 
banned from ever being played 
again on the airwaves under the 
FCC obscenity law. In addition, 
interview clips with Howard and 
his partners in crime provide a 
nice means of pacing the humor, 
as well as giving more insight as 
to who these people really are.
My preconceived notion of 
humor in radio was a lot of cheap 
sex jokes and a lot more ego on 
the part of the host. My few prior 
experiences with Stem did little 
to dispel that image. However, 
the one thing that my definition 
didnt take into account was 
Sterns great ability as an 
enabler of humor. The sketches 
in which Stem participates are 
usually funny, but the ones in 
which he creates the circum
stances to let others make the 
humor are almost always bet
ter. Stems greatest talent may 
lie in his ability to sense when to 
sit back and let the show happen 
around him (see Kinison-Hahn 
for a classic example).
Not to say that Stem doesnt 
roll up his sleeves and take the 
low road a few times. Jokes like 
offering a couple tickets to a Joe 
Jackson show for having sex on 
the radio or a character called 
Fartman dont take a Carn
egie Mellon education to under
stand (or any education, for that 
matter), but you still find your
self cracking a smile.
The extravagant jokes are of
ten the most worthwhile ones.
Calling London to bid on the 
bones of the Elephant Man is 
something that a lot of us would 
have liked to do when Michael 
Jackson made his offer a few 
years ago. Most of us have prob
ably wanted to have our say in 
international affairs at one time 
or another. Howard lets us do 
these things, albeit vicariously, 
and the results are some of the 
best moments on tape.
The last refreshing surprise is 
that Stem is willing to let the 
audience hear him lose a few 
battles. Taking the KinisonHahn feud without the context 
of the preceding broadcasts, 
Stem ends up looking bad as 
Kinison makes accusatory ref
erences about Howard joking 
about the suicide of Kinisons 
brother (or maybe knowing what 
Howard said would have made 
my opinion of him worse). On a 
lighter note, the piece where 
Howard and his mother discuss 
his penis size on-air is a testa
ment to his ability to laugh at 
himself.
My one complaint with Cruci
fied is that the angle of the FCC 
protest statement is played up
1991 One Twelve Inc. 
early in the discs, but seems to 
be thrown aside after the Christ
mas party recordings in favor of 
a Best of Howard Stem theme. 
The FCC battle would have been 
a very interesting topic, and it 
seems a shame to have aban
doned it without examining it 
more fully.
However, this juxtaposition 
provides an interesting revela
tion  it shows the extent to 
which the FCC tolerates parody 
as opposed to reality. The banned 
Christmas party broadcast dem
onstrates this perfectly in its 
handling ofhomosexualitythe 
party has several homosexual 
guests who participate in the 
broadcast to varying degrees.
Later on in Crucified, Stem has 
given us extensive clips of his 
Out-of-the-Closet Stem per
sona, but the FCC was never 
mentioned in connection with 
this piece. Cartoonish parodies 
of homosexuals are OK, but the 
Real McCoy gets banned  go 
figure that nutty FCC!
The question the Crucified lis
tener is ultimately supposed to 
ask is, Should Howard be al
lowed to do this? Is this what the 
First Amendment is all about? 
The answer, in the mind of any 
reasonable member of society, 
should be yes. Sketches like The 
Homo Room may not have any 
redeeming social value and may 
not be funny to many people, but 
the ideal behind free speech is 
that we have access to any ideas 
and information we want. Even 
if its cheap sex jokes and onphone fights between celebrities.

Highlander 2 nAsAvieAu lHA oSns FUEsj
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
After I saw the film Highlander, I 
was speechless. I was speechless be
cause of the great fight scenes, the 
innovative plot, the fantastic music, 
the wonderful acting  I was speech
less because Highlander was such a 
great movie.
After I saw Highlander 2: The Quick
ening, I was again speechless, but for a 
different reason. This time I was speech
less because I couldnt believe the bor
ing fight scenes, the atrocious plot, the 
dull music, the terrible acting  I was 
speechless because Highlander 2 was, 
without a doubt, the worst movie I have 
ever seen.
Now when I say Highlander 2 was 
the worst movie I have ever seen, I 
dont want you to misunderstand me, 
because I want you to fully understand 
the meaning behind this damning state
ment. D.C. Cab, SupermanTV, Leonard 
Part 6, Hudson Hawk, Run, Jaws the 
Revenge, They Live, Vibes, Ernest Goes 
to Camp  all of these terribly awful 
movies are cinematic masterpieces 
when compared to Highlander 2.
 Movie Review 
No Stars. HIGHLANDER 2: THE QUICK
ENING. MacLeod and Ramirez are back, 
but should have stayed away. Starring 
Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, 
Michael Ironside, and Virginia Madsen.
Once again, let me reiterate, High
lander 2 is the worst movie I have ever 
seen.
Of course, there are, without a doubt, 
some nonbelievers out there. People 
who loved the first film so much that 
they dont want to believe that the se
quel could possibly be that bad. Well, 
believe it, and if thats not enough, then 
maybe the plot from Highlander 2 will 
be enough to turn your stomach.
As the film opens, we learn that in the 
year 1999 a giant protective shield de
signed by Connor MacLeod (Christo
pher Lambert) was put around the 
Earth to save the planet from the thin
ning ozone layer and the searing sun. 
However, 25 years later, the shield is 
smothering the planet with a constant
MacLeod is now 75 years old and looks 
and acts like a weak Marlon Brando 
from The Godfather.
Next thing you know, terrorists are 
attempting to blow up the shield, we 
find out that MacLeod and Ramirez 
arent really humans but aliens from 
the planet Zeist who were banished to 
Earth some 500 years ago, MacLeod 
magically becomes 35 years old and 
immortal again, Ramirez (Sean 
Connery) is resurrected out of the blue, 
MacLeod hooks up with the leader of 
the terrorist group (Virginia Madsen), 
and MacLeods old enemy from the 
planet Zeist, General Katana (Michael 
Ironside), has come to Earth to kill 
MacLeod for some unexplained reason. 
Does any of this make sense to you? 
Dont worry, it doesnt make any sense 
to me, and I saw this film.
Not even Connerys powerful pres
ence saves this atrocious film. As a 
matter of fact, Im still trying to get over 
the fact that he was even part of such a 
bad film (he must have been drugged or 
blackmailed or something). As for the 
rest of the actors, Lambert doesnt 
add anything new to his role, Ironside
Interstar Releasing 
Not even Sean Connery could save 
Highlander 2 from a cinematic death.
a bad Jack Nicholson impression, and 
Madsen could pick up a few pointers 
from a freshman acting class.
But even good acting probably 
couldnt have saved this film, because 
this film was D.O.A. the second that its
temperature and humidity of 97, and kept on reminding me of someone doing so-called plot was thought up. The plot you.
of Highlander 2 is so bad that not only 
does it makes no sense, but it also 
completely ignores the first films plot. 
Remember from the end of Highlander 
that MacLeod can now read minds? 
Well, in Highlander 2 he cant (or sim
ply doesnt). Ramirez can now do magic. 
And whats with this alien crap? When 
did MacLeod and Ramirez decide to 
become aliens? The only thing which 
meshes with the first film is the charac
ters and the fact that they cant be 
killed unless their heads are cut off.
It simply amazes me that the same 
director from Highlander (Russell 
Mulcahy), the same actors, and $34 
million couldnt have produced a film 
that was even slightly good. Instead, 
we get a film so boring and confusing 
that Ive seen car commercials with 
more substance to them.
I really dont know what else to say, 
except do not see this film, ever. Dont 
see it in the theaters, dont see it on 
video, dont see it on cable, dont see it 
on TV... dont ever see this movie. But 
if you simply cant help yourself and, 
for some sick unexplainable reason, do 
see this film, dont say I didnt warn
Carnegie Science Center thrills visitors with its many exhibits
CENTER, from page L9
ing the top of the mountain.
Sport Chair Sprint Races  
This exhibit deals with the frag
ile topic of handicaps in sports 
and serves as a fun learning 
tool. Center visitors sit in a sta
tionary wheelchair and spin the 
wheels as if to push the chair. 
There is an attached monitor 
that informs the user how fast 
the wheelchair would actually 
be moving and how much of a 
distance it would travel if it was 
mobile.The Henry Buhl, Jr. Planetarium and Observatory:
This is the most disheartening 
part of a visit to the Center. The 
planetarium tries to use the typi
cal Epcot schtick of preparing 
audiences for a trip into space 
before entering the HB2 space 
ship. Only five-year-olds will 
appreciate this little game.
Once inside the planetarium, 
visitors are encountered by Cap
tain Dan, who parades around 
in a Star TVeft-like space suit. 
Captain Dan informs visitors 
that the buttons on the sides of 
their chairs will allow them to 
choose the type of stars and skies 
they would like to see. Then he 
and his computer Hank (which 
ironically sounds remarkably 
similar to the narrators voice in 
the Rangos Omnimax theater) 
guide the crew through the 
galaxy exploring black holes, 
stars, and the sun.
The only impressive parts of 
the program is the reenactment 
of a super nova explosion and 
the laser design used to show an 
outline of the Pittsburghs sky
line during the spaceship land
ing sequence.
Third Floor
Early Learners Landing:
The Center notes that this ex
hibit is for those between the 
ages of three and six, but the 
displays can be enjoyed by chil
dren of all ages. Little boxes 
and drawers that can be opened 
that display fake food which rep
resents the balanced food groups. 
The plastic green vegetables ac
tually seem appetizing.
Besides trying to entice young
sters with the aesthetically 
pleasing string beans, there are 
little compartments that contain 
models of the human circula
tory system, the digestive tract, 
and skeletal system. The skel
etal system is most interesting 
because of its realistic bone tex
ture and its moveable parts.
Fourth Floor
Eating Exhibit: Food is a 
topic of conversation that never 
becomes tiresome. The questions 
what will we eat?, when will 
we eat?, and how will we eat? 
are constantly reiterated. The 
eating exhibit introduces visi
tors to basic information about 
food, dealingwithhowitismade 
and how it gets to our table, but 
also offers other interesting tid
bits of information. Heres a 
sample of some of the exhibits 
that deal with the basics and 
the more unusual:
Balanced Meals: Choose the 
Right Stuff This is a fake food 
display that entices visitors with 
plastic spaghetti, french fries, 
ice cream, and other culinary 
treats. By using a computer 
screen sensitive to touch, one 
can formulate daily balanced 
meals by choosing the foods 
shown in the display case. The 
computer is supposed to spew 
out a printed copy of the menus 
chosen, but fails to do so inter
mittently. A piece of paper and a 
pen might be necessary to record 
the data.
Calories: They Come and Go 
 Those who loathe exercising 
or any type of activity after eat
ing a fattening meal might want
to avoid this showcase. The dis
play shows how much exercise 
is needed to bum off certain 
foods. For example, the typical 
college students meal, 1/4 of a 
pizza, would take 186 minutes 
of studying to be burned off. A 
guilt-burdened food consumer 
can calculate how long it will 
take him/her to bum off a group 
of foods with the help of the 
calculator attached to the dis
play. A display like this is much 
needed on a college campus 
where things like limited fat in
take and unlimited exercise are 
avoided.
Good Microbes DisplayThe 
mini exhibit shows that bacte
ria can be a blessing from time 
to time. There would be a lack of 
yogurt and an abundance of hu
man digestive problems with
out these microorganisms.

There is also a microscope with

row  The TV monitor used for 
this display shows a cartoon that 
talks about what future genera
tions will eat, how it will be 
obtained, and how it will be pack
aged. With the impending de
struction of the environment, 
less plastic and styrofoam will 
be used to wrap food in. Also, 
fewer preservatives will also be 
used in order to maintain public
health. This is an interesting 
part of the exhibit because it 
deals with a current issue and 
can educate young people in a 
way that they can relate to  
via Saturday- moming-cartoon 
style.
The Works: This exhibit 
shows onlookers the wonders of 
lasers and computers. The top
ics covered in the exhibit in
clude electricity, lasers, robots, 
and cryogenics. Cryogenics is 
exciting, especially for little kids 
and adults who have no idea 
what the term means. In a sched
uled experiment using nitrogen, 
a Center employee transforms a 
shatterproof rubberball into an
item as breakable as Moms good 
china. One can conclude from 
this spectacular event that other 
experiments would be equally 
as good.
When the mall shop sales end 
and the seasonal movie flops 
debut in nearby theaters, re
member the Carnegie Science 
Center. With its unusual handson exhibits, films, and other pre
sentations it provides an activ
ity that doesnt involve dodging 
the crowds running towards the 
25% off rack or leaving a rowdy 
crowd complaining about a 
poorly-acted-out love scene. Go 
ahead, board that rollercoaster.

Metropolitan
Ahh... the dreams of young rich Americans; they 
dont want to be happy  just wealthy. Metropoli
tan tells the tale of a group of young New Yorkers 
who sit around and bitch about their place in 
society and the material items they feel they lack. 
The saga of the young bourgeoisie as they fall into 
love triangles and attempt to make a name for 
themselves on the social scene is shallow yet inter
esting. The movie shows the aspirations of todays 
youth  the quest for quick cash.
Although character relationships are not well 
developed and the basic dialogue is dry and some
what unrealistic, the film has managed to gain 
recognition.
If you are remotely interested in dealing with 
characters addiction to the good life risk that 
dollar. If not, save that dollar and use it to build 
your future fortune.

Mortal Thoughts
If you enjoy predictable plots, slightly suspenseful flicks starring Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, 
and a conclusion that Entertainment Tonights 
Leonard Maltin says pulls the rug out of every
thing else just seen, then walk on over DH 2210 
Friday evening in the freezing cold, November 
night air.
Alan Rudolphs film centers around the murder 
of an abusive husband by his wife and the ensuing 
piecing together of the incidents surrounding the 
murder. Demi Moore plays the horrified wifes best 
friend who, as an accomplice in the murder, is 
forced to endure police interrogations.
With some interesting flashback sequences and 
the familiar acting styles of Willis and Moore that 
audiences have come to expect, Mortal Thoughts is 
an easy thriller to digest after a long week of tough 
classes, but isnt scary enough to keep you from 
getting to sleep the night before buggy free rolls.

The Rocketeer
Billed as the poor mans Indiana Jones, The 
Rocketeer still manages to have the look and feel of 
a 1930s serial, as well as plenty of action.
Bill Campbell plays a stunt pilot who stumbles 
onto a much sought-after secret weapon  a back
pack which enables the user to fly. Add one girl
friend (Jennifer Connelly), one really nasty bad guy 
(Timothy Dalton, who steals the film), lots of action, 
and you have yourself one action-packed film.
The Rocketeer wont win any awards for being the 
most original film, but the characters are a lot of fun 
to watch, the action is fairly exciting, and the 
special effects are really good. So spend a night with 
a rocketeer.

Beetlejuice
Day-o! Daaay-o! Daylight come and me wanna 
go home. Six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch. 
Shake, shake, shake seora. Shake your body 
down. No, this isnt a Harry Belafonte music fest; 
its a film about the ghost with the most. At least 
thats what Michael Keaton, as Beetlejuice, will tell 
you.
Now, you ask why you should go see Beetlejuice. 
First, it will only cost you a buck. Second, theres 
nothing more exhilarating than a movie packed 
with big name stars  in addition to Michael 
Keaton, theres Winona Ryder (sans Johnny Depp), 
Alec Baldwin (in his pre-Kim Basinger days), Geena 
Davis (before she got nasty in Thelma and Louise), 
and Jeffery Jones (who you will probably recognize 
as Ed Rooney from Ferris Buellers Day Off). Fi
nally, its a light-weight entertaining film that is 
good for quite a few laughs. And dont forget, theres 
also the music factor for you Harry Belafonte mani
acs out there.

Tin Machine II suffers from identity crisis
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
A few years ago David Bowies 
eyes tired from squinting in the 
limelight, so he unobtrusively 
re-entered the music world 
guised as the singer of a four
some called Tin Machine. This 
odd reversal of the typical solo 
artists career path produced an 
energetic, raspy, guitar-fraught 
debut, free of the moderated dis
sonance and indulgent crypticism that are Bowies trade
marks. If the Thin White Duke 
wanted a stylistic sabbatical, he 
seemed to have gotten it.
The bands recently-released 
Tin Machine 77, however, back
slides from hard rock to Bowies 
traditional agenda. The result 
is an indecisive hybrid, having 
neither the uppity nonchalance 
of classic rock n roll, nor the 
ponderous alien appeal of 
Bowies early works. While 
boasting a few highlights, the 
albums musical waffling drains 
it of focus. Whats left behind is 
entertaining but unremarkable.
The albums formula is a sort 
of enlightened cacophony, tak
ing a standard rock architecture 
and adding the eerie, experimen
tal sound of an era where the 
hallucinogens ran like water and 
were considered nearly essen
tial to a songwriters diet. The 
effect is a little unnerving and, 
in fact, seems almost mocking. 
You are liable to leap to your 
dancing feet in the middle of a 
fast-paced rush of guitar, then 
be embarrassed by some alien 
twist to the music and pretend 
you were just going to the bath
room.
The lyrics are sparse and byand-large incomprehensible; 
scarier still is that they were 
mostly penned by Bowie, and we

??72 TIN MACHINE II. By Tin
Machine, Something records.
may therefore presume that he 
means them. This contrasts 
sharply with the straight for
ward  if just as decadent  
lyrical tones of Tin Machines 
first album. Scientific analysis 
of the CDs pamphlet reveals a 
high correlation between song 
eccentricity and level of Bowie 
participation. The verdict is 
clear: old habits die hard, and 
the Goblin Kings apparent en
thusiasm for diversity seems to 
have gone into hibernation for 
fairer days.
The album kicks off promis
ingly with Baby Universal, a 
vibrant and stimulating num
ber that one hopes will set the 
tone for the songs to come. But 
even this welcoming mat is tar
nished with the warning signs 
of an untidy interior, and the 
next few tracks begin to swamp 
us with uninspired nonconfor
mity thats interrupted only oc
casionally by a gem or two. 
Among this latter class is If 
There Is Something, a fervid 
stint of upbeat nostalgia where 
the bands repressed classic rock 
urges are briefly allowed to run 
free. Stateside, co-written by 
former Iggy Popper Hunt Sales, 
takes on a blues tonality and is 
palatable, if a bit weary. Sorry, 
initially refreshing in its intelli
gibility, begins to grate after a 
few minutes of incessant apol
ogy.
The rest of the album sounds 
like what would be released on 
B-sides if B-sides were released 
as singles. Amlapura, a jan
gling acoustic piece, is echoey

and wistful, but too disharmoni
ous to lift any spirits. You Cant 
Talk, is sly and jumpy, but suf
fers from an irritating chorus. 
And Goodbye, Mr. Ed, with its 
sluggish melody andits ambigu
ous cynicism, tends to make the 
listener wonder why he or she 
isnt out buying groceries right
now.
What David Bowie really 
needs to do is resolve his bands 
identity crisis. If fast-paced rock 
tunes tickle his fancy, then let 
him preserve the medium, 
rather than dilute it. On the 
other hand, if he wants to lapse 
into his musical history (not at 
all a bad idea; Ziggy really could 
play guitar) then let him do so 
wholeheartedly, not filtering sty
listic rays through a curtain of 
the tried and true.
Tin Machine II isnt a bad kid 
at heart, and she manages to get ' 
a few toes tapping here or there. 
But, like a cookie-hungry child 
whos just watched a documen
tary on tooth decay, she lacks 
conviction, andTinMachine can 
hardly expect us to feel it for her.
