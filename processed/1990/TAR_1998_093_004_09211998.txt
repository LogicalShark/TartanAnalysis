CMU groups face alcohol investigations
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
Two student organizations are 
currently under investigation for 
alcohol-related incidents. The 
Asian Students Association (ASA) 
has already ben issued an inter
nal citation for the sale of alcohol, 
and the Korean Student Associa
tion (KSA) could face a variety of 
charges stemming from an offcampus party. As a result of this' 
party, two students had to be 
treated at area hospitals, includ
ing one who was admitted to in
tensive care.
On September 5, Campus Po
lice shut down a party held at the 
ASA special interest house (Mar
garet Morrison 133) at approxi
mately 11 pm. According to the 
police report, there was a $3 ad
mission fee at the party, and once 
inside, attendees could buy alco
holic drinks. Three individuals 
who live in the apartment as well 
as the organization received in
ternal citations for selling alcohol.
University policy states a fee 
must never be charged for the 
service of alcohol unless the ap
propriate Pennsylvania Liquor 
Control Board licensing proce
dures have been completed. Sell
ing alcohol without the appropri
ate licenses is a violation of state 
liquor laws, so the students and
any harm.... We decided to charge 
because we needed to raise funds 
for the party. Alot of people around 
campus sell alcohol at parties, so 
we thought it was okay.
The organization must now ap
pear before the University Disci
plinary Committee to determine if 
further action will be taken against
We didn't mean any harm.... A lot of 
people around campus sell alcohol at 
parties, so we thought it was okay. 
Raymond Li 
president of ASA
ASA could face further charges 
from the Commonwealth. The in
vestigation is ongoing.
We didnt know that we werent 
allowed to sell alcohol, said 
Raymond Li, a junior social and 
decisions sciences major and the 
president of ASA. We didnt mean
the students or organization. AccordingtoLi, this hearing has been 
scheduled for today, Monday Sep
tember 21. The students could face 
a range of punishments.
There have been cases in the 
past when special interest houses 
were found to have been irrespon
sible in monitoring gatherings 
where alcohol was present, said 
Paul Fowler, associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs. In these cases, indi
viduals were issued citations where 
appropriate, and the organizations 
lost special interest house status. 
There have been other cases where 
organizations have been denied 
recognition or disbanded as a re
sult of community standard viola
tions. No two cases are ever ex
actly the same, and given the indi
vidual circumstances, the outcome 
may always vary.
In an unrelated incident, KSA 
is under investigation for a num
ber of charges including under
age drinking and providing alco
hol to intoxicated persons after a 
party on September 11. The offcampus party was held at Ginza 
Korean and Japanese Restaurant 
on Atwood Street in Oakland.
Campus Police became aware 
of the party after responding to 
the Morewood Gardens parking 
lot at approximately 1:40 am that

New position fills need for collaboration
By MAUREEN McGRANAGHAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Friday, Dr. Duane Adams, 
vice provost of Research, announced 
the appointment of Dr. Christina 
Gabriel to the newly created position 
of director of Collaborative Initia
tives. The position involves estab
lishing more interaction and promot
ing the exchange of ideas between 
Carnegie Mellon and businesses in 
the region.
The world is changing very 
quickly, and this is one of the ways 
Carnegie Mellon is trying to deal 
with that, Gabriel said. Regions 
are looking to university technolo
gies to help sustain economic 
growth, and its important [for the 
University] to work with industry 
because industrys long-term inter
ests can often open up important new re
search directions.
Gabriel will also be working with depart
ments and faculty within the University, 
coordinating different collaborations. Provost 
Paul Christiano said, There might be oppor
tunities out there from government or indus
try that no single individual can respond to. 
The position is intended to deal with research 
activities that could benefit from coordinated 
efforts at the inception stage.
Gabriel is currently helping to coordinate 
Carnegie Mellons strategic planning .proLlliy Rouhani/Tartan Junior Staff

gram that will chart the course of the 
Universitys progress in the years to come.
Its very aggressive, Gabriel said. Every 
school, every department is asking what does 
it mean to the University and what resources 
does it need.
President Cohon and the Board of.Trustees 
are looking particularly at the area of bio
technology and health policy as one in which 
Carnegie Mellon could play a larger role in 
the years to come.
Basically every college [in CMU] has some 
degree of involvement in biotechnology and
health policy, Christiano 
said. [Gabriel] will be work
ing to coordinate these differ
ent departments. Based on 
the results of university-wide 
interviews and committee rec
ommendations, the president 
and trustees will be making 
decisions about Carnegie 
Mellons future role in these 
fields. Were asking what are 
we good at and how can we 
leverage it to become a leader 
in certain areas, Gabriel said.
The position also involves es
tablishing and strengthening 
interaction between Carnegie 
Mellon and other institutions 
in the Pittsburgh region.
We need to be part of the 
whole community fabric, 
Gabriel said.
Gabriel came to Carnegie Mellon from 
Case Western Reserve University where 
she was vice president for Research and 
Technology Transfer. Before that she 
worked for the National Science Founda
tion, managing the Engineering 
Directorates annual federal budget for re
search and education. She has a masters as 
well as a doctorate degree in electrical and 
computer engineering from the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology and an under
graduate degree in electrical engineering 
from the University of Pittsburgh.

The BOC and TOC saw an Increase in attendance last year.
Not only are companies getting 
more involved with students 
while they are at CMU, but 
they are also trying to entice 
potential employees with new 
marketing tactics.
With the Business Opportu
nities Conference (BOC) and 
Technical Opportunities Confer
ence (TOC) coming up this week 
these information sessions are 
in full swing on campus.
This is a really exciting time 
for CMU, said senior business 
administration major and 
chairman of this years BOC 
Ryan Kruger. The companies 
are all very excited. The way 
the school is growing and the 
way the economy is going, stu
dents from CMU, especially, are 
now in the drivers seat.
Kruger is also a student am
bassador at the Career Cen
ter. He works closely with the 
companies attending the BOC 
and TOC and helps determine 
recruitment tactics. This year, 
Kruger has seen an increase of 
interest from students and a 
doubling of interview slots 
from companies over the pre
vious year.
The cause of the increase in 
student interest could be due to
students that theyre looking 
to attract.
Some of the events that com
panies are planning vary with 
what type of student theyre 
looking for. According to 
Kruger, prizes seem to be most 
common. For example, Trilogy 
is offering the opportunity to 
win a free laptop to students if 
they attend their information 
sessions. But most big compa
nies, like Proctor & Gamble, 
offer free food and small gifts.
Kruger pointed out that 
these large companies tend to 
have information sessions that 
are wider in scope and use 
more extravagant recruitment 
methods. Big companies like 
to sell their initiatives to a 
broader range of students. 
Some recruiters have even of
fered cash prizes to people who 
answer questions about the 
company correctly.
According to Kruger smaller 
companies such as consulting 
or tech firms, like Trilogy, usu
ally choose to be more selec
tive. They tend to get the scoop 
on future employees from pro
fessors and other students. 
Their strategy is to zero in on

Institute gives research grant
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute (HHMI) announced 
last Wednesday that it will 
award $1.6 million to Carnegie 
Mellon. The grant, which was 
one of 58 awarded nationwide, 
i is intended to foster medically 
relevant education at the un
dergraduate level.
The award follows two other 
such grants given to CMU since 
1989 by HHMI. Each year, the 
University uses a part of these 
grants to support undergradu
ate research projects. The sup
port has allowed for about 85 
percent of all students graduat
ing in medically relevant fields, 
such as biological and chemical 
sciences, to conduct research.
I am extremely pleased with 
the commitment and support 
Carnegie Mellon has received 
from the Howard Hughes Medi
cal Institute, said Susan A. 
Henry, Dean of the Mellon Col
lege of Science. This funding en
ables Carnegie Mellon to offer its 
undergraduate students the fin
est scientific education available 
anywhere in the country.
There were certain criteria 
by which HHMI selected CMU 
as a university eligible for re
ceiving the awards. One such 
criterion was the proportion of 
students graduating from CMU 
who went on to scientific and 
medical careers. In addition, in 
order for HHMI to continue to 
award money to the University, 
Carnegie Mellon had to come 
up with creative proposals for 
ways that the money would be 
spent in addition to increased 
research opportunities.
Various programs have al
ready been developed with the 
money, and the grants will con
tinue to support them. One ex
ample is mentoring projects in 
which faculty work directly with 
students are some examples. The 
money will also be used to in
crease first-year research. Other
examples include outreach pro
grams that work with local pub
lic schools to create interest in 
science among children. The 
HHMI grant, along with money 
from the National Science Foun
dation, also helps fund a sum
mer research program at CMU.
In addition to these programs, 
the money will allow for new 
laboratory facilities and curricu
lum development. Already an up
grade for the labs with HHMI 
grant money in the Biological 
Sciences Department has al
lowed for a state-of-the-art 
course in cell and developmen
tal biology. In addition, the 
money will continue to be used 
for new curricula in computa
tional biology.
To date, HHMI has given $425 
million to various universities 
through its undergraduate grant 
program since 1988. The past 
two grants that CMU received 
were for $1.2 million and $1.5 
million. Each award is given on 
a five-year basis.

Research takes closer 
look at bird memories
CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) - 
Chalk one up for our fine, feathered 
friends: Behavioral scientists say 
that birds possess the ability to re
member not only a past event but 
when it happened, the kind of 
memory previously thought unique 
to humans.
The study of scrub jays, published in 
todays issue of the journal Nature, 
marks what the researchers said is 
the first demonstration of episodic, or 
event-based, memory in animals other 
than humans.
This type of memory is jokingly re
ferred to as mental time travel be
cause it involves mental images of 
past events. To remember where you 
put your car keys, you might see 
yourself walking into the house the 
night before and dropping the keys on 
a table in the hall.
Birds and humans took different 
branches on the evolutionary tree 250 
million years ago, so the finding sug
gests that fundamental mechanisms 
of information storage in the brain 
may have evolved even before the age 
of dinosaurs.
The study also may help researchers 
more fully understand the human brains 
decline into Alzheimers disease.
It could be a big step in understand
ing how space, time, and events are 
represented in the brain, neurobiolo
gists Kathryn J effery and J ohn OKeefe 
of University College in London said 
in a review of the study. It also helps 
solve a problem in the field of human 
memory  where and how is a memory 
for events formed and stored?
Episodic memory functions in a fun
damentally different way from and 
uses other parts of the brain than 
knowing a fact, such as what car keys 
are. That is a form of semantic memory. 
Its also different from having a more 
basic instinct, such as hunger.
In the bird study, researchers Nicola 
S. Clayton of the University of Califor
nia, Davis and Anthony Dickinson of 
Cambridge University in England al
lowed scrub jays to store their favorite 
food, larvae of wax moths, or wax 
worms, on one side of a sand-filled 
tray. The birds hid peanuts on the 
other side of the tray.
Birds chose to retrieve the wax 
worms if they were less than four 
hours old. Birds that had previously 
learned that the wax worms decom
pose within five days avoided the old 
worms in favor of peanuts. Making 
such decisions based on the timing of 
past events is a crucial element of 
episodic memory.
In a second test, the researchers 
removed the rotten five-day-old worms. 
The birds learned that the wax worms 
were more likely to be gone the longer 
they had to wait to recover them.
If the birds were allowed back into the 
sand tray four hours after they stored 
them, they invariably poked in the sand 
for the fresh wax worms. But if they 
were returned to the tray after five days, 
nearly one-third immediately checked 
for peanuts instead of wax worms.
Other scientists were intrigued but 
less convinced that the birds were dis
playing true episodic memory. And 
they noted that studies of monkeys 
and even rats have shown broadly 
similar results.
But they conceded that science has 
not yet clearly defined what would 
constitute episodic memory outside of 
humans. We can remember what we 
ate for dinner last night by actually 
putting ourselves back in time at the 
table, said neurobiologist Larry 
Squire of the University of California, 
San Diego. Its clear that animals can 
work by memory. But there isnt any 
obvious way to ask an animal to do 
that sort of mental time travel.
Verdict condemns 
uranium company
PITTSBURGH (AP) - The owners of 
a uranium plant ordered to pay $36.5 
million to cancer sufferers and their 
families could be facing a final tally of 
many millions more.
A federal jury found that Babcock and 
Wilcox Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. 
negligently ran the now-closed Nuclear 
Materials and Fuels Corp., allowing ra
diation to escape from the facility that 
fueled submarines during the Cold War.
But Thursdays verdict does not in
clude any potential punitive damages, 
which the jury is to take up Monday. Nor 
does it settle about 100 other claims still 
pending against the companies.
The plaintiffs are residents of Apollo, 
a river town of 1,900 people some 30 
miles northeast of Pittsburgh. They say 
three decades of radiation from the plant 
have caused an unusually high inci
dence of uterine, breast, and kidney can
cers and leukemia.
The verdict will be split among 12 
residents. The largest payment, $8.5 
million, will go to the estate of Tina Hall, 
who died of leukemia at age 24 on Christ
mas Day 1992.
The plaintiffs cried and hugged each 
other after the verdict was read but said 
they were withholding further reaction 
until next week.
To their credit, the, plaintiffs fought 
the good fight and stayed with it when it 
got tough. They never wavered, said Bill 
Kerr, a friend of some of the plaintiffs, 
who was Apollos mayor in the early 1980s.
The plant, which opened in 1957, con
verted uranium hexaflouride until it was 
mothballed in 1986 and was demolished 
in 1992. Along with a nearby plutonium 
plant not involved in the case, it was the 
major employer in Apollo.
Alfred Wilcox, a lawyer for the com
panies, had argued the plaintiffs failed 
to show any increased likelihood of can
cer after releases of uranium, or pro
vide any estimate of radiation exposure 
to plant neighbors.
Fred Baron, the lawyer representing 
the plaintiffs, offered testimony from
witnesses who said the overall cancer 
rate in Apollo from 1990-94 was six 
times that of nearby boroughs and town
ships, with the breast cancer rate eight 
times as high.
Local man owes 
taxes from 1911
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Bob Cohen 
wasnt even bom when a previous owner 
of his shop allowed a property tax debt to 
mount from the years 1911-15. How
ever, he is the one obligated to pay it.
The 72-year-old man recently re
ceived a terse notice saying he owes 
$1,151 in back real estate taxes on his 
downtown Pittsburgh beauty and bar
ber supply business.
The debt had gone undetected as the 
property changed hands several times 
since the 1920s, including Cohens pur
chase of the business in 1983. Such debts 
didnt accrue interest at that time, so the 
amount hasnt increased. This is no 
way to treat people, said Cohen, who 
paid $1,134 in 1997 taxes in April.
The passage of time and ownership 
doesnt absolve Cohen from responsibil
ity, said Jack Chielli, a spokesman for 
the Allegheny County Controllers Of
fice. The law doesnt exonerate taxes 
upon change of ownership, Chielli said.
Thats why real estate companies do 
title searches, he said.
The county sold its list of delinquent 
tax liens to a Georgia-based collection 
agency, GLS Capital Services Inc., for 
$34.4 million last year. Most of the hens 
dated to the 1990s, while the oldest was 
from 1908.
A private company would be more 
aggressive and diligent in collecting the 
back taxes, Chielli said. When a com
pany offers this, we get our money.
Cohen doesnt think much of the pro
cess. In my business, if we turn a cus
tomer over to a collection agency, we try 
to collect first, he said.
Chielli said a title search was con
ducted in the 1920s, but failed to alert the 
buyer or seller to the outstanding debt.
Now, Cohen must either pay up or seek 
a court order to make the company that 
conducted the title search settle the debt.
Researchers find 
butter health risks
AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -But; 
ter, which is found in almost every pantry 
in the Western world, has been branded 
as deadly as cigarettes and should carry a 
similar health warning, researchers in 
New Zealand said Saturday.
The Auckland University medical re
searchers said butter is as dangerous to 
the human heart as cigarettes and want 
shoppers constantly reminded of that fact.
Rod Jackson, associate professor of 
epidemiology at Auckland University 
Medical School, said a diet high in satu
rated fats  such as butter and other 
dairy products  has made New Zealand 
among the top 10 nations in the world 
for occurrence of heart disease.
I believe butter should have health 
warnings on the packets telling people 
they are risking heart attacks, Jackson 
said. It should be treated like a cigar  
only taken once a year at Christmas.
Dairy farmers immediately branded 
the warning idea a ridiculous scare tao* 
tic. Theres nothing wrong with butter 
in moderation. If you listened to every* 
thing these health experts said; you 
wouldnt go outside, said Federated; 
Farmersspokesman Kevin Wooding. 1
Gunmen murder; 
investigative host
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Gunj 
men in northeastern Brazil killed a telejvision journalist famed for exposing 
shady dealings of politicians and busi1- 
nessmen, colleagues said Saturday.
Donizete Adauto, 38, was hauled from 
his car by six. men and shot just after 
midnight Friday, said producer Aparecida 
Oliveira of the Meio Norte TV station. ;
Adautos daily show, which specialized 
in investigative journalism,, was broad^ 
cast locally in the poor, northeastern state 
of Piaui, 1,200 miles north of Rio.
The type of show he did was very close 
to the limit. He used to receive a lot of 
death threats, Oliveira said by tele
phone from Teresina, the capital of Piaui:Congress releases videotape of Clinton grand jury testimony
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clintons defenders braced 
{Saturday for the release of a 
tnountain of new detail from the 
Starr investigation, including, 
congressional sources said, tran
scripts of messages the chief ex
ecutive left on Monica Lewinskys 
telephone answering machine.
Those transcripts  along with 
Lewinskys grand jury testimony 
and numerous interviews with 
prosecutors and the FBI  were 
among the 2,800 pages set for re
lease on Monday. A videotape of 
Clintons four-hour grand jury tes
timony and an accompanying tran
script will also be made public.
Several officials have said in 
recent days that the videotape 
shows Clinton evasive and some
times angry when questioned 
about various sex acts with Ms. 
Lewinsky, frequently referring 
prosecutors back to a prepared
statement he read at the begin
ning of his questioning.
Even before the videos release, 
broadcast outlets were making 
plans for an unprecedented airing 
of images of a President being 
questioned under oath about 
sexual relations with a young aide.
In addition to the tape and the 
grand jury testimony, congres
sional sources said, the material 
to be released includes an inven
tory of the items taken from 
Lewinskys apartment by the FBI. 
The material also includes the text 
of unsent letters to the president 
and files removed from her com
puter hard drive. The officials 
spoke on condition of anonymity.
The public also will get a look 
at lab reports on Clintons blood 
and on a blue dress owned by 
Lewinsky, results that Starr says 
confirmed a sexual encounter 
between the two.
Legal memoranda and letters 
that testify to a long, hard-fought 
battle between the White House 
and Kenneth Starrs office also 
will be made public, these sources 
said. The material includes cor
respondence in which the two 
sides negotiated over the 
presidents grand jury testimony 
and pleadings related to Starrs 
attempt to force testimony by 
presidential aides and Secret 
Service employees.
The only grand jury testimony 
to be released on Monday is that 
of Clinton and Lewinsky. Distri
bution of testimony by other key 
players, including presidential 
secretary Betty Currie, Clinton 
friend Vernon Jordan, and one
time Lewinsky friend Linda 
Tripp, will remain under seal, at 
least for the time being.
Clinton himself made no men
tion of the scandal surrounding
his presidency as he delivered his 
weekly radio address Saturday, 
seeking to focus attention, in
stead, on a coming tax-cut battle 
in Congress.
White House spokesman James 
Kennedy complained that Clinton 
was being denied an advance re
view of the material that would 
allow us to respond to these alle
gations in the proper manner.
The Clinton videotape has 
been the focus of continuing 
debate in Congress. Playboy 
would not be allowed to put that 
kind of pornography on the air
waves, Democratic Represen
tative W.G. Hefner of North 
Carolina said after visiting the 
White House. And I dont know 
what it does to build a case be
cause the case is already there. 
Its been admitted to,7 he added. 
That, in my opinion, is just to 
embarrass the President.
Republicans counter the tape 
is important evidence in Kenneth 
Starrs report, which cited 11 po
tentially impeachable offenses, 
some involving perjury.
The president himself has ad
mitted he lied, but he doesnt 
admit to perjury, Representa
tive Bob Livingston (R-La.), said 
in an interview on CNN. I 
think that the jury, in essence 
the Congress, has to look at the 
evidence. The American people 
are effectively the jury as 
well, and they have to look at 
the evidence.
Some Judiciary Committee 
members have said they expect 
the panel will likely meet in early 
October to decide whether to rec
ommend a formal impeachment 
inquiry to the House.
There was no indication of what 
the scope of such an inquiry would 
be. Representative Henry Hyde
(R-1.), chairman of the commit? 
tee, and other Republicans have 
suggested in recnt days that it 
could be expanded beyond th 
issue of Clintons relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky and his ef
forts to hide it.
Much of the congressional atr 
tention to Starrs evidence has 
focused on the videotape, being 
released in the shadow of midr 
term elections.
In bipartisan response to an 
article this week about a'longr 
ago extramarital affair by Hyde', 
the leaders of the Republican 
and Democratic Hojuse and Senr 
ate campaign committees an
nounced agreement that they 
would not finance candidates 
who make purely personal atr 
tacks on their opponents' 
There was no mention, though, 
of candidates who make use of 
the videotape.

from National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, October 6, 
1948  The assistant director of 
the College of Engineering and 
Science, William R. Work, died 
following a brief illness. He had 
served as a member of the faculty 
and administration of Carnegie 
Tech since 1905. He began as a 
part-time mathematics instruc
tor. Since then, he had also served 
as an instructor in electrical en
gineering and was the chairman 
of the freshman committee of the 
College of Engineering.
25 YEARS AGO, October 9, 
1973  Amendments to the Mens 
Dormitory Handbook gave resi
dent students new dorm privi
leges. Students would be given 
the right to use hot plates and 
popcorn poppers under 500 watts. 
Additionally, the handbook said 
that students could have pets as
long as they submitted a petition 
signed by everyone on the re
questing students floor. Name 
tags were issued for these pets, 
and the owner was held respon
sible for any damages or extra 
maintenance costs resulting from 
the pet.
10 YEARS AGO, September 
27, 1988  One of the Fences 
bottom crossbars broke at the be
ginning of the academic year. For 
two weeks, the crossbar had been 
propped up by cinder blocks which 
were put in place by Phi Kappa 
Theta fraternity while they held 
the Fence from September 3 to 
September 17.
Because of the tradition repre
sented by the Fence, the Univer
sity was attempting to obtain as 
much istudent input as possible 
before making a decision about
how to fix it. Student Ombuds
man Michael Murphy and Stu
dent Body President Andy 
Robitshek scheduled a town meet
ing to explore the options.
The plan was to explore one or 
two options and then present 
them to the University commu
nity for feedback.
The Fence was built by the Car
negie Tech class of 1923 as a 
meeting place for seniors. In 1939 
it was still known as the Senior 
Fence, and underclassmen were 
not allowed to sit on it. It had 
been repaired before in its 65 
years of existence, and though 
the Fence was eventually re
placed in its entirety, it was be
lieved that no piece of the origi
nal Senior Fence remained.

same it had been for the past 
seven years.
The amount of things that can 
be purchased with the Activities 
Fee has decreased substantially 
due to inflation, said Student 
Body President Bryon Krug.

Corrections and Clarifications...
Last weeks Tartan editorial, CMU should expand benefits prograin, stated that a committee 
looking into same-sex domestic partnership benefits was newly-formed. The committee is a general 
Human Resources Committee that has always existed but is currently focusing on the benefits issue.
Last weeks issue of the Tartan wrongly identified Suzie Chong as Andress Appolon. The quote 
appearing below the Person's Opinion picture belonged to Andress Appolon.

Carnegie Mellon In Brief
Justice Dept, reviews 
Gammage case again
The criminal section of the Civil Rights Division of 
| Justice along with the U.S. Attorneys office in 
| Pittsburgh has begun the process of reviewing the 
| files related to the death of Jonny Gammage.
Gammage died of suffocation in the Pittsburgh 
suburb of Brentwood after being pulled over by the 
i police. Five officers have been implicated in 
Gammages death, and several court cases have 
taken place. However, none of the officers has been 
convicted after mistrials and acquittals.
Protesters from Pittsburgh went to Washington 
D.C. on February 20 of this year to petition the 
Department of Justice to look into the death. The 
justice department said that it would look into the 
case. Since then, the federal government has not 
filed any charges in the case.
Pilot phase begins for 
program to help staff
Human Resources has launched a pilot for a new 
service called Qualified University Employees Seek
ing Transfers (QUEST) designed to aid current staff 
members seeking transfer opportunities.
Staff members have raised concerns over not 
being considered for positions that open up inside 
the University. President Cohon-responded to these 
concerns at his .Staff Address by citing statistics 
that showed many staff members do transfer within
Carnegie Mellon every year.
The new program will allow staff members to 
store rsums in a computer where they can be 
recalled by Human Resources representatives at 
the request of hiring managers.
Water supply cuts off 
after main valve fails
This past Wednesday, the College of Fine Arts 
lost water after a valve gate on a major pipeline in 
the building failed. Despite the valves failure, 
Facilities Management Services (FMS) was able 
to keep the water supply going into the building 
until 12:45 pm when the hired contractor arrived 
to inspect and repair the damages.
Before the contractor arrived, FMS had located 
the problem. The water supply to the entire build
ing was then turned off so the valve could be 
replaced, thus eliminating use of the rest rooms, 
drinking fountains, and utility sinks for the rest of 
the day. Many students did not have access to 
bathroom facilities for the day. CFA students 
were forced to deal with the inconvenience of 
going to the other academic buildings in-between 
classes to use the bathrooms.
The 2-1/2" valve wouldnt hold, so it needed to 
be shut off and replaced, said Service Response 
Center manager Kyle Tomer when asked why the 
failure occurred.
Tomer reported that after the contractors re
placement of the 2-1/2" valve was completed CMU 
plumbers restored running water to the building 
by 8 pm Wednesday night.

Gifts draw students to job fairs
INCENTIVES, from page 1
the specific students they have in 
mind. Usually, companies hold 
invitation-only dinners at which 
they pitch incentives such as 
worldwide travel or the location 
of the company itself. The ses
sions are set up so that the stu
dents are also introduced to the 
highly motivated and tightly-knit 
current employees.
Bryon Krug, former student body 
president and CMU alumnus, now 
works for Trilogy, a company that 
he discovered at the TOC.
Trilogy treated me better than 
any of the companies with which 
I interviewed, said Krug. When 
they found out I was interested in 
starting my own company even
tually, they sent me books about 
start-ups. It was the kind of per
sonal attention that made me feel 
like Trilogy cared about me.
One incentive that Krug remem
bers is a silver pen from Tiffanys 
that Trilogy sent him with a note 
that read, Signing your offer let
ter just got a little easier. How
ever, these small gestures are not 
what sold Krug on Trilogy.
If companies are giving in
centives to students as the only 
way of enhancing their image, 
they are'being stupid, said 
Krug. After the initial contact 
is made, the company itself is 
what really matters.
Kruger pointed out, though, that 
the present companies are getting 
involved with CMU more so than 
in the past. Companies offer lec
tures, donate money for research, 
sponsor numerous events, and 
give larger scholarships.
This is their way with 
partnering with the school for 
the long term as to produce the 
most effective results, said 
Kruger. They are buying into 
the teachings and values of CMU 
students for the long run.
Last year the BOC and TOC 
hosted over 200 employers and 
were attended by more than 3,000 
students. Both Kruger and se
nior social and decision sciences 
major Teresa Dietrich, chair of 
the TOC, are expecting this 
years conferences to be bigger 
and better.
Whatever their recruitment 
tactics are, the companies are 
looking to attract the best pos
sible candidates. Whatever 
methods are used to increase 
interest, the bottom line, is the 
company itself and if it has the 
correct environment to satisfy 
your needs. The incentives, 
however, do help a bit.
Its important that students 
take a good look at the compa
nies themselves, said Kruger, 
rather than who has the big
gest party. But you might ini
tially go to an event for the free 
food and discover that you re
ally like that company. Con
versely, you might go to an 
event dead-set on working for a 
particular company and dis
cover that you wouldnt like 
working there after all.
Pittsburgh Police had been dis
patched to a fraternity to take a 
burglary report. That officer was 
sent to the fraternity by his ser
geant. When the officer arrived, 
the Pittsburgh Police officers were 
explaining to the fraternity broth
ers that the incident was under 
CMU Campus Polices jurisdic
tion, and they turned the matter 
over to the responding Campus 
Police officer.
The brothers took the officer to 
their houses garage and work
shop. They said that they were 
the last ones to use the garage 
two nights earlier. When they 
went to the garage, they said that 
the doorknob was missing from 
the service door, and the latch 
handle on the garage door was 
bent. Once they entered the ga
rage through the service door, 
they said they noticed that the 
garage door was resting on an air 
pump, indicatingthatithadbeen 
opened since the last time they 
were in the garage.
One of the brothers cars was in 
the garage, and its back window 
had been completely broken. A 
2"x4" was inside the car, and the 
brother believed that the piece of 
lumber was the device used to 
break the window.
The other brother, last years 
buggy chairman for the frater
nity, told the officer that one of 
their buggies was missing. He 
said the buggy was pinkish-red 
in color and was missing its wind
shield and tail cone. The officer 
radioed dispatch for the investi
gations bureau. A sergeant and a 
detective responded.
The officer asked the former 
buggy chair about why someone 
would want to take his fraternitys 
buggy. He said that the buggy 
was probably taken just to cause 
them distress, since perennial 
buggy winners like Pi Kappa Al
pha and Spirit would be a more 
likely target if the burglars were 
after buggy secrets. Aside from 
distress, the brother could not 
give the officer any further clues 
as to motive or suspects.
The detective found fresh fin
gerprints on the trunk lid of the 
damaged car. He then dusted the 
trunk lid and lifted one partial 
print. One of the brothers found 
the missing doorknob to the ser
vice door in the dumpster. The 
knob was taken to the Campus 
Police office for processing.
The officers also took the piece 
of lumber because of the possibil
ity of finding latent fingerprints 
in a crime lab. The officers be
lieved the lumber did not come 
from within the fraternitys ga
rage, since there were drywall 
screws in it, and the brothers 
stated that they kept no such 
lumber in their garage.
A brother from another fra
ternity approached the officers 
with a doorknob that he said 
had been taken off his 
fraternitys garage service door. 
He also stated that nothing ap
peared to be missing from his 
fraternitys garage.
9/18 BURGLARY, 4:50 am - 
Campus Police received an anony
mous call saying that the missing 
fraternity buggy could be found 
behind the monument at the 
Westinghouse pond. Three offic
ers responded to the area and 
found a pinkish-red buggy with 
parts lying inside and outside the 
buggy. Photographs were taken 
of the scene, and the buggy and 
parts were taken back to the Cam
pus Police office.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tar
tan staff see the reports: the edi
tor-in-chief, the news editor, and 
the staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and 
fraternity names are omitted from 
the printed report. Ethnic descrip
tions and other personal details 
are given only in the context of 
complete descriptions.
 Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

9/13 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
5:20 am  A security guard saw 
a male hanging out of his Boss 
Hall window and burning some
thing. The window was on the 
back side of the residence hall. 
He asked the male what he was 
doing, but the actor ran away. 
Two Campus Police officers re
sponded to the second floor of 
Boss Hall, but the actor was gone 
when they arrived. On the win
dow ledge, they saw a partially 
burnt ball of toilet paper, used 
wooden matches, and a small 
bottle of mens cologne, presum
ably used to aid the combustion 
of the toilet paper. The officers 
conducted a search, but the actor 
was nowhere to be found.
9/13 MEDICAL, 4:59 pm - A 
Shirley Apartments resident con
tacted Campus Police to provide 
his friend transportation to the 
hospital. He said his friend had 
taken too much LSD and was 
tripping hard. Two officers re
sponded to the scene. The trip
ping student was conscious but 
unresponsive and would not open 
his eyes. The officer radioed for a 
City Medic unit.
The friend said that his room
mate had taken three hits of LSD 
from blotter tabs. The officers 
asked the roommate if he knew 
where the victim had procured 
the LSD, but he said he did not. 
When the City Medics arrived 
and completed their evaluation, 
they radioed Pittsburgh Police 
dispatch and requested City Po
lice units because of the potential 
for violence.
The City Medics transported the 
victim to the University of Pitts
burgh Medical Center (UPMC) 
without incident. Student Life was 
notified of the situation, and a 
representative was taken to 
UPMC to check on the victim.

Repercussions of alcohol violations threaten groups
ALCOHOL, from page 1
Saturday morning with CMU 
EMS to treat an unconscious stu
dent. According to James 
LaPaglia, chief of Campus Po
lice, the first-year male student 
who had been at the party at 
Ginza was transported to Pres
byterian Hospital for alcohol-related illness. The student was 
then transferred to Montefiore 
Hospital where he was admitted 
in intensive care. The student 
has since been discharged.
A report from an anonymous 
source says the students blood 
alcohol content (BAC) was 0.5. 
This report could not be con
firmed. I cant confirm this BAC, 
but considering [his alcohol con
sumption] put him in intensive 
care, its possible, said LaPaglia. 
According to Anita Barkin, direc
tor of Health Services, as a gen
eral rule, for a person to achieve 
a BAC of 0.5, he or she would 
have had to consume more than 
four drinks. BAC of 0.5 causes
the heartbeat and respiration to 
be very slow and could lead to 
deep coma with death probable.
Campus Police believe some
one from the party at Ginza drove 
the intoxicated student to 
Morewood and dropped him off. 
According to the police report, 
there was another student in 
the Morewood parking lot 
when Campus Police arrived 
with EMS. This student has 
since been identified by po
lice as being at the same party 
as the unconscious victim. 
This student informed Cam
pus Police that there may be 
more people needing assis- _ 
tance at the Ginza party. 
The guy who was passed out 
had been dropped off by some 
people at the party they had come 
from, said Dave Eyvazzadeh, a 
first-year CIT undeclared student. 
Eyvazzadeh had been passing 
through Morewood Parking lot 
when the incident occurred and 
spoke to the student helping the
victim. According to the guy who 
was helping [the unconsious vic
tim], [the victim] threw up and 
passed out in the parking lot so 
hed helped him over to the curb 
where I found them by the bike 
rack. The guy who was helping
approximately seven city police 
cruisers and two ambulance units 
responded to the call at Ginza.
There were over 100 people 
inside, said Chief LaPaglia. 
When the police arrived, they all 
decided to leave. People were all
People were all over the place  in the 
alley; behind the building. One male was 
[unconscious] inside the party."
James LaPaglia 
chief of Campus Police
[the victim] had him sitting up and 
hunched over, patting him on the 
back and face, trying to revive him. 
According to LaPaglia, the offcampus party was outside the ju
risdiction of Campus Police so they 
called Pittsburgh Police to accom
pany them to the party. In all,
over the place  in the alley, be
hind the building. One male was 
[unconscious] inside the party. 
The unconscious student was 
treated and released from Pres
byterian Hospital. An investiga
tion, which is being conducted 
jointly by Campus Police and
Pennsylvania State Liquor Con
trol enforcement officials, is un
derway into who furnished the 
alcohol. The owners of Ginza, 
Bokee and Chong Kim, said they 
rented their Karaoke room to 
the students, but did not realize 
the students were drinking 
in their establishment.
We thought they were just 
having a meeting, said Bokee 
Kim. The door was open and 
they were in and out. I dont 
know exactly how many people 
were there.
The Kims said they took no 
name for the reservation at their 
restaurant this night, and the 
 $200 charge for the room has 
not been paid yet. According to 
the owners, Ginza did not provide 
any alcohol or food to the students 
so there were no waiters or wait
resses working upstairs. The en
tire staff was downstairs prepar
ing food for the next day and were 
not aware that students were 
drinking or ill until police arrived.
Though the police report states 
that KSAheld the party at Ginza, 
Michael Han, a senior industrial 
management major and president 
of KSA, denies that KSA was 
involved in organizing or funding 
the party. This was not a KSAsponsored event, said Han. No 
money came from KSA.
According to Han, parties of 
this type are a tradition in the 
Korean community. Upperclass
men Koreans plan the event for 
first-year students. Its a cul
tural thing from a long time ago, 
said Han. Its even practiced at 
universities in Korea. Its not 
hazing  its a way for freshmen 
to get to know upperclassmen. 
They arent forced to drink.
According to Han, the initiation 
involves drinking and singing a 
song or telling a story. He also 
said he believed that the students 
had brought the alcohol into Ginza.
Paul Son, a freshman H&SS 
undeclared major, ended up in 
the hospital for a day and a half 
after taking part in the initia
tion. My friends were telling me 
to drink a lot, said Son. I re
member telling my friends to 
drink a lot. Then, boom, I was in 
the hospital. Son said he was not 
forced to drink but that there was 
a lot of peer pressure to drink.
Son said he gave a sworn state
ment to the police in which he told 
them the party had been affiliated 
with KSA, but he no longer be
lieves KSA was involved with the 
party at Ginza in any way. I cant 
even remember talking to police, 
said Son. When I woke up, the 
police were asking me questions. 
Son said he may have mentioned 
KSA while bragging that morning 
about how much he drank. He 
said at the time he was proud of 
how much he drank because he 
believed drinking was a way for 
him to belong to a group.
This is not the first time Carn
egie Mellon has dealt with the 
implications of binge drinking on 
campus. Binge drinking is gener
ally defined as five or more drinks 
for a man at any one time or four 
or more drinks for a woman. In 
December of 1994, Justin Cham
bers, a sophomore materials sci
ence major, died of alcohol poison
ing after attending his fraternity 
Christmas party. Chambers had 
a BAC of .54. Binge drinking has 
also received considerable na
tional media attention in recent 
months after an 18-year old Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy freshman, Scott Krueger, died 
last September from overdosing 
on alcohol at a fraternity party.
National data supports the 
view that students are drinking 
earlier and that binge drinking, in 
particular, is on the rise, said 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs. We do know that our 
students are somewhat less likely 
to have consumed alcohol in high 
school than students at our peer 
institutions, and that they are 
similarly less likely to consume 
alcohol during their first year than 
other students. I would be naive 
to suggest, though, that we have 
any less of an issue than other 
schools when it comes to binge 
drinking. It is a very serious issue 
for the students drinking, for the 
person facilitating or supporting 
that drinking, and for family and 
friends whose lives can be changed 
forever by such drinking.

Carnegie Mellon University21 September 1998
Students should fill 
Senate vacancies
Recent resignations and a lack 
of student participation have left 
10 of 36 seats in Student Senate 
vacant. While all of the colleges 
still have at least some of their 
seats filled, parts of the student 
body remain grossly 
underrepresented due to the va
cancies. Students should take a 
greater interest in the operations 
of Senate and work to fill the 
empty Senate seats.
Student Senate is a vital cam
pus organization that controls 
student resources, such as the 
Activities Fee, and communicates 
student needs to the administra
tion. Because each Senator repre
sents around 140 students, hav
ing 10 vacant seats leaves a large 
portion of the student body with
out adequate representation. For 
example, the sole seat for the 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts 
program is vacant, and the Col
lege of Fine Arts has filled only 
three of its seven allotted seats.
While the vacancies may not 
halt the daily operations of Sen
ate, they minimize the 
organizations overall effective
ness. A smaller number of stu
dents participating in Senate 
leads to fewer people working on 
its individual committees. Sen
ate committees have experienced 
enough difficulty carrying out 
projects in the past when a larger 
number of students were partici
pating. Now that Senate has 
shrunk to 26 active senators, fill
ing committees and accomplish
ing important tasks will be even
more difficult.
Some Senate seats were not 
filled in the last election due to a 
lack of student participation, 
while the other vacancies are due 
to five resignations this semes
ter. Before this number increases, 
Senators must realize the impor
tance of fulfilling their terms. 
Most of the recent resignations 
stem from time conflicts with spe
cific classes and other activities. 
The weekly Senate meetings are 
planned after considering the 
schedules of the students in
volved. While Senate should plan 
a time that accommodates as 
many of the elected officers 
as possible, the Senators 
must also make these meetings a 
high priority.
The process of becoming a Sena
tor is a simple one. Students need 
only 25 signatures from members 
of their college and approval by 
the current Senators to become a 
part of the organization. While it 
is important to make sure the seats 
are filled, it is also necessary to 
choose the best candidate for the 
job. Students should only sign pe
titions for other students if they 
are confident that the person will 
serve their college effectively.
The position of Senator is a seri
ous one  students should make 
a commitment to Senate and the 
student body by running for and 
serving their year-long terms ef
fectively. This problem can only 
be remedied if students realize 
the importance of Senators and 
take action to fill the currentvoid.
Housing must ensure 
apartment conditions
The recent fire in Cathedral 
Mansions raises some questions 
about the effectiveness of expand
ing the use ofthe apartment build
ing as a dormitory. There are nu
merous problems with the 
buildings infrastructure, includ
ing a questionable fire alarm sys
tem and collapsing ceilings. For 
students well-being, University 
Housing should look into whether 
Cathedral Mansions is a safe envi
ronment and take decisive action 
to make any necessary changes 
before leasing more apartments.
In 1997-1998,40 percent of the 
students in Cathedral Mansions 
were first-year students. These 
students come to their first year 
of college expecting to live in a 
dormitory, and they treat Cathe
dral Mansions as such. But the 
building is not meant for that 
type of student life  it lacks 
features such as community space 
and includes equipment such as 
full-service kitchens. Also, given 
the structure of the building, it is 
extremely difficult for RAs to 
monitor the building as they 
would a dorm like Donner or 
Hamerschlag. So students end up 
abusing a building which is al
ready close to 80 years old, and 
incidents like the recent fire hap
pen very easily.
If one student rented an effi
ciency apartment through Cathe
dral Mansions management, the 
cost would be $4750 for that per
son for ten months, including a 
utility package similar to the 
Universitys. However, Housing 
Services rents these same efficiency apartments to two students 
per apartment at $4260 per per
son, a total of $8520  more than 
one and a half times the Cathe
dral Mansions management 
amount for the same space. When 
a student pays that much more 
for the same housing facility, they 
expect to know when theres a fire 
on the fourth floor of their build
ing. They expect summer inspec
tions and improvements to pre
clude their apartment roof col
lapsing. It isnt fair to ask stu
dents to pay a higher rate for the 
same space when the safety and 
service are lacking.
One way to reach a short-term 
solution is to assess Cathedral 
Mansions before purchasing more 
space in the building. Survey stu
dents about living conditions. See 
how many students choose to in
stead move into dorms. Work out 
a plan where Cathedral Mansions 
maintenance staff can fix emer
gency maintenance problems, 
since they are more familiar with 
the buildings problems.
Certainly, Cathedral Mansions 
is a viable alternative to conven
tional campus housing, especially 
for more seasoned upperclass stu
dents. With many first-year stu
dents still living in the Hampton 
Inn, such an alternative is a good 
solution in the short run. How
ever, safety considerations should 
not be permanently put aside in 
favor of a quick fix. Students liv
ing in Cathedral Mansions, just 
like students in University Hous
ing, deserve quality for 
their money.
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art EditorLocal plant closing hurts workers
This June'Nabisco announced its in
tention to slut down its plant in Pitts
burgh. Althmgh the closing is in viola
tion of its unbn contracts, the plants 350 
employees cm still expect to lose their 
jobs less thm two months from now. 
Theyre calliig for a large-scale boycott of 
Nabisco procucts, telling In Pittsburgh 
that the cormany has made a breach-of 
trust with tin community. With Naty^co 
publicly stating its firm commitment to 
its decision, lowever, the strength of the 
proposed boycott is dubious. It could only 
work on a natonal scale, and what incen
tive does soneone in Cincinatti have to 
wean their kds off Oreos? The idea of 
labor solidarity doesnt seem to cany far 
these days - even the AFL-CIO has 
declined to leid its support to the effort. 
For the Nabfeco employees, the stakes 
could hardly De higher. Once the plant 
closes, many (f them will have no way of 
maintaining tieir middle-class standard 
of living. Thej'll soon be lucky if they can 
make minimum wage, which wont even 
pay enough hr a family to scrape to
gether the basic necessities of life.
How can Nibisco so casually wreck 
the lives of o many people? From a 
practical staidpoint, its easy to do. 
Nabisco is onlj a portion of RJR Nabisco, 
one of the woilds largest international 
conglomerates, and as such it can move 
around pretty nuch as it pleases. Trans
portation and communications technol
ogy have progressed immensely in the 
past few decades, to the point where the 
most significait factor associated with 
any particular ocation is labor cost. Not 
surprisingly, tiat seems to be the real 
motive behind the Nabisco move. Its 
transferring production from the Pitts
burgh plant to mother, non-union plant 
in Ohio, where the workers make less 
than half as nuch. As for the moral 
question of Ho>v can they do this?

Shes also eight, intelligent, 
an overall success, and her 
blood, like most peoples, clots 
normally. Bruises and inju
ries dont force her to make a 
trip to Childrens Hospital. 
These kids turned out the wdy 
they did, because Aarons par
ents left his sex to good old 
mother nature. Their baljy 
turned out to be a boy, and1 
inherited the hemophiliac 
gene present in their fami]
making him a cripple for the 
rest of his life. Melissas par
ents, on the other hand, made 
sure that they had a female 
child, so as to prevent the 
child from suffering from the 
hemophiliac genes present in 
their family.
Hemophilia is a sex-linked 
hereditary bleeding disorder 
transmitted on a gene of the 
Xchromosome. The condition 
is much rarer in females than 
in males. If a family has a 
history of hemophilia, it is 
much less likely for its daugh
ters have the disease than its 
sons. Isnt it natural for people 
in such a family to desire fe
male children?
If you want to choose the 
sex of your child to avoid dis
eases such as hemophilia that 
can be passed on to children 
of a particular sex, you cer
tainly have the right to do so. 
The Genetics and IVF (In 
Vitro Fertilization) Institute 
recently developed a 93-per
cent accurate technique to se
lect a childs sex. Couples can 
choose the gender of their ba
bies by using a sperm-sorting 
technique followed by artifi
cial insemination. This pro
cedure is comparable to a vac
cine. People vaccinate their 
children against polio, small 
pox, and tetanus so they can 
prevent their children from 
catching these diseases. If 
parents choose the sex of their 
child in order to avoid a ge
netic disease, its like a vac
cine thats given before birth. 
It would be cruel to deny some
one the right to choose the 
sex of their child if they knew 
that they could prevent a 
serious genetic disease by 
doing so.
It might be less intuitive to 
decide, but if a couple wanted 
a child of a particular sex, for 
reasons of family balancing, 
it would also be unfair to deny 
them this choice. Why do you 
want to make sure your child
doesnt have a genetic 
diesease? So that he can lead 
a better life. Similarly, if you 
want your child to be intelli
gent and good-looking, youre 
justified because you want to 
improve the childs quality of 
life. A child with a genetic 
disease might hot be too dif
ferent from an obese child, or 
a foolish one, as far as the 
quality of life goes. Parents 
vaccinate their children from 
tetanus and polio and measles. 
In the same way, they should 
be allowed to vaccinate them 
from obesity and lack of intel
ligence once technology exists 
that allows them to do so.
Theres also nothing wrong 
with using this technology to 
have a child of a particular 
sex for no reason but personal 
choice. If you remove the tech
nology, the couple can try to 
conceive many times, abort
ing the baby if they discover 
its of the undesired sex. Or

Presidents exploits leave U.S. in uproar
Resignation would preserve respect
Open Forum
by Dave Liber
The past few weeks have made it clear 
that the current White House is more 
openly devious and corrupt than any
thing this nation has seen in years. Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starrs report 
regarding Clinton, which the House of 
Representatives voted to make public, 
outlines 11 impeachable offenses com
mitted by President Clinton, including 
peijury, witness tampering, and obstruc
tion of justice. It also contains some 400 
pages of sexually graphic testimony from 
Clinton himself, Monica Lewinsky, and 
many other White House aides.
The real question here does not revolve 
around whether or not President Clinton 
had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. 
That issue is between Ms. Lewinsky, 
President Clinton, and Clintons family. 
The real issue here is whether President 
Clinton knowingly lied to the Paula Jones 
grandjury in sworn depositions. IfClinton 
lied, or even if he knowingly misrepre
sented himself or misled the grand jury, 
he must do the only honorable thing 
and resign.
While there may not be enough legal 
evidence to support a full impeachment 
of President Clinton; there is enough to 
suggest that he should dutifully resign. If 
Clinton is to demonstrate any conscience, 
he should accept the consequences of 
his lying and resign. It is the only way 
he can still preserve the sanctity of the 
Presidency.
This debate is no longer about sex; 
those Americans who repeatedly state 
that it is ought to actually read a news
paper. The debate .that is engulfing our 
country right now is about whether Presi
dent Clinton broke the law, and about 
how corrupt and misleading he has been. 
If he broke the law, then Congress has no 
choice but to impeach him if he does not 
resign. The Supreme Court has ruled 
that President Clinton is in no way im
mune from the very laws that govern the 
rest of us and that he must face any and 
all lawsuits and indictments while in 
office. To quote Justice Antonin Scalia 
before the Supreme Court ruling that 
Jones could go ahead with her case 
against Clinton: If we can see a Presi
dent vacationing on Marthas Vineyard 
and playing golf, then we can see a Presi
dent defending himself in trial.
The Supreme Court has ruled repeat
edly in the past four years that although 
he may be President, William Jefferson 
Clinton is not a god and he is in no way 
above the laws that govern the rest of the 
361 million Americans. President Clinton 
must finally realize that he has acted with 
malice towards the very laws he has sworn 
to uphold as President.
This investigation has been long and 
costly; there is no denying that. However, 
it has never been a witch-hunt against 
President Clinton. Every single step of the 
investigation had to be approved by the 
U.S. Department of Justice and the Fed
eral Circuit Court. Had President Clinton 
cooperated with the Independent Coun
sel, the investigation might never have 
even gotten this far.
President Clintons 
own attorneys have 
stated that there is 
nothing illegal in his 
intentionally mislead
ing the grandjury and 
giving misleading 
depositions. While its 
debatable whether 
such statements do 
qualify as perjury, 
theyre still over
whelmingly dishonest 
and corrupt.
I urge every Ameri
can to honestly con
sider the facts of this 
case. No matter what 
the economy is doing 
and what programs 
and laws he has imple
mented since his elec- Mohd
tion, can we have a sitting President who 
has lied repeatedly under oath or, at the 
very least, intentionally misled a grand 
jury in a legal proceeding? Even if, as his 
lawyers say, he did not perjure himself, 
President Clinton did intentionally mis
lead a federal proceeding with answers 
that were dishonest, inaccurate, and know
ingly wrong. We cannot allow this Presi
dent to enjoy a status that no other Ameri
can would be allowed to have.
If President Clinton has any decency left, 
he will try to preserve the office, leadership, 
and moral virtue of the Presidency of the 
United States by resigning. President Nixon 
had enough decency to resign for a coverup 
operation, which is what Clinton is tryin 
gto do. It is time for Clinton to stop asking 
for forgiveness and to start taking respon
sibility for his actions as a moral, respon
sible human being.

major. He welcomes all responsible replies

Keep position separate from person
Open Forum
by Rebecca Fribush
The Starr Report  all 36 boxes of it  
is now in the hands of Congress. Indepen
dent Counsel Kenneth Starrs report on 
President Clintons conduct with Monica 
Lewinsky has set off a flurry of debate, 
posturing, and really tacky cigar jokes. 
Clintons fate depends on what the legis
lators make of the report. Despite the 
documents obvious 
importance, it con
sists of little more 
than an avalanche 
of detail showing 
that  the horror of 
it all!  Clinton did 
some rather unappetizingthings with 
Lewinsky and then 
tried to hide them.
Yes, this behavior 
was morally repre
hensible to the point 
of sliminess. It was 
unfair to Clintons 
wife, his daughter, 
and Lewinsky her
self. It was also a 
colossal failure of 
judgement. It has 
made, and probably 
Zekrl Ismall/Tartan Art Staff should make, mil
lions of Americans lose respect for him. 
But it was not a crime, and impeaching 
him for acts stemming from it would be 
wrong. He certainly wasnt forthcoming 
about his relationship at his deposition in 
the Paula Jones civil case and his later 
grand jury testimony. And his lawyers 
arguments that, because of his use of a 
very narrow definition of sexual rela
tions, he didnt technically lie are tenu
ous at best. But it would be ridiculous to 
hold him legally accountable and force 
him out of the presidency for lying about 
an affair. His relationship with Lewinsky 
has nothing whatsoever to do with his 
ability to govern.
He may have lied in a legal setting, but 
he shouldnt have been in one answering 
questions about private dealings between 
consenting adults in the first place. 
Lewinsky was originally called as a wit
ness in Paula Jones case against Clinton, 
which was subsequently dismissed. So 
Clinton issued misleading statements 
during the course of an inactive court
proceeding about something that was only 
tangentially related to the case and did 
not in itself constitute legal wrongdoing. 
Going after him for this is overzealous to 
say the least.
If provable, Starrs accusations that 
Clinton obstructed justice by encouraging 
others to lie might justify thinking about 
impeachment. But the evidence Starr has 
collected to prove these claims is very 
inconclusive. Clinton may have hinted 
about things, but theres certainly no evi
dence that he explicitly directed anyone to 
lie. Compare that to Watergate, where 
there were actual tapes of Nixon discuss
ing the payment of hush money to wit
nesses to keep them from implicating him 
in a burglary coverup.
Even just forcing Clinton to resign would 
set a dangerous precedent. The scandal is 
creating a climate in which major viola
tions of privacy are not only acceptable but 
are defended as necessary. If inappropriate 
private actions cost our president his office, 
that will legitimize using the same argu
ments to destroy other officials for even 
less, or for relationships that they ended 
years ago. The repercussions are already 
happening. If Clintons personal life be
comes relevant to public debate, so now do 
those of his critics. The press has already 
dredged up long-ago affairs on the part of 
three prominent Republicans in Congress. 
Using details like these to smear oppo
nents during campaigns is nothing new, of 
course. But, during campaigns, citizens 
can vote and show whether they think 
revelations about a candidates personal 
life affect his or her ability to represent 
them. Thats better than coming forth with 
these stories once politicians are actually 
elected and distracting them and the na
tion from what they came into office to do.
This mindset can root out people who 
might do a perfectly good job of governing 
the nation, or scare them so that they never 
even try. Disclosures about personal life 
are turning into tools to damage those 
whose politics one disagrees with. The man 
who broke the story of an affair that Rep. 
Henry Hyde had in the 1960s is a lifelong 
Democrat. He admitted that he went public 
with the story for partisan reasons.
Clinton should be allowed to continue 
his term. If he stays in office, lots of people 
might feel that justice wasnt served. But 
impeaching him when the evidence doesnt 
indicate that he deserves such a step, or 
letting him resign and creating a climate 
where the personal is political, would be 
even more unjust.

Technology lets kidsColumnist puts legal mindset on trial

GENETICS, from page 8
worse still, they could have the 
child and discard it. This sort of 
thing is practiced in some In
dian villages and other places. 
Why not just cut to the chase 
and let parents have the baby 
they want? A couple might be 
making a wrong choice by want
ing a baby of a particular gen
der, but thats a separate issue.
Some argue that, since this 
technology is not 100 percent 
accurate, couples could end up 
having children of the undesired 
sex, which might lead them to 
treat these offspring poorly be
cause ofheightened expectaions. 
Whats being ignored here is that, 
without the use of this technol
ogy, couples have much less 
chance of having the kind of ba
bies they want. So, if you dont 
engineer the genetic makeup of
advantage
your child, you are increasing 
the chances ofthe child not being 
what you want. People should be 
made aware that the technology 
is not perfect yet. If they are 
prepared for the possibility of 
failure, and still choose to use 
the technology, it is doubtful that 
they would treat the child badly 
in the unlikely event that the 
child is not of the gender or ge
netic makeup they want.
Fine tuningyour childs genes 
does not alter the fact that the 
child is yours  its only the 
best of you. Its the responsibil
ity of parents to make sure that 
they let their children start out 
with the best.

LAWYERS, from page 9
the letter of the law above all else, 
considering it a firmer foundation 
of judgment than the fickle whims 
of human desire and corruption. 
This has been the dominant view 
of law passed down to much of 
modern Western society  No 
ones above the law. In contrast, 
the Chinese legal system has al
ways held written law as far too 
rigid and inflexible to deal with the 
infinite variety that is human life. 
Better to have wise men examine 
the situation with insight, exercis
ing creativity and justice.
It is this infinite variety of 
human life that is the source of 
the lawyer explosion today. Things 
change, new technologies are in
troduced, and life is more complex 
than ever. And in a country that 
lives by the rule of law, there must 
be a new law written to cover 
every new dispute or conflict. We, 
as ordinary citizens, cant hope to 
comprehend the labyrinthine 
maze of legalese written to cover 
every contingency. And so, as 
much as we hate them, we need 
our lawyers. The law is fair, and 
the law is just, but if you cant 
understand every bit of it per
fectly, those who do will use their 
knowledge to their advantage. If 
youre injured in an accident, so 
the advertisement goes, youd bet
ter have a lawyer to help you fight 
for your rights. Because the other 
party doesnt care about you, be
cause people dont care about jus
tice, you need to have the lawyer 
who knows which laws will back 
you. And so it goes, an arms race 
of lawyers  the more complex 
your life, the more need you have 
for a lawyer (or a team of such). 
The rule of law, in its quest 
for equal justice, has created a 
class of elites.
We as Americans see no other 
justice than the justice of law. 
For many, there is little concep
tion of a morality higher than the 
written law. There are few people 
who can reach towards a higher 
morality and understand things 
like how laws can be unjust  
adhering to a superseding stan
dard of rightness. Since law 
holds such a high place in society', 
we can do no more than worship 
(in our capitalistic way) those who 
understand and wield the law  
the lawyers.
How often is it that a court case 
is fought with an appeal to higher 
morality? Only in rare cases does 
an exceptional individual under
stand an unjust law and appeal it 
to the Supreme Court on the basis 
of some higher moral standard 
alone. In our everyday lives, any 
wrong we experience can only be 
righted by appealing to some law. 
How many times have we heard 
someone wronged, only to find that 
it was completely legal? Instead of 
appealing to what seems to be an 
inborn human instinct for justice, 
we enlist the services of a lawyer 
to search for legal precedents or 
some esoteric law that will sup
port our case. This reliance on the 
law as the moral authority, in
stead of holding ourselves to the 
morality that we are born with as 
human beings, is the source of the 
American plague of lawyers. In 
the land of the rule of law, it is 
lawyers who rule.

Home opener thrills Tartan football fans
FOOTBALL, from page 16
touchdown strike. That play 
capped off a 16 play, 81-yard drive, 
and put the Tartans on top 7-0.
For the next three quarters it 
would be all Tartans, all the time. 
The Bison were baffled at how to 
stop the Tartan offense, and the 
Bethany attack was shackled by 
the CMU defense. After the first 
drive of the se'cond half, the Tar
tans were up 28-0, and the Bisons 
collective back was broken. Tar
tan reserves closed out the game, 
and tacked on 10 more points while 
only allowing seven. Everyone and
his mother got into the game and 
everyone was ecstatic  except, of 
course, the Bison. Final score: 
CMU 38-Bethany 7.
Seven more people who prob
ably werent happy were those 
crazy, painted Bravehearts. 
Those wacky guys who covered 
their bodies with paint, rushed 
down onto the field after every 
score and did pushups for each 
Tartan point. Lets see  
7+14+21+28+31+38 = 139 push
ups. The Tartans beat Bethany 
so badly that even the fans are 
sore. That is a beating.

Sophomore running back Matt Strohl runs around a block.Runners defeat IUP
RUNNERS, from page 16
The men also had a lot to be 
enthusiastic about. Their race last 
weekend brought home five win
ners from the top 10 finalists at 
IUP. This was one of our bigger 
meets. It was our first real test to 
see what kind of shape we were in, 
said senior Josh Donner. Junior 
Kenn Oldham came in third, senior 
Kristo Kriechbaum came in fourth, 
junior Brian Meyer took fifth place, 
and Donner and freshman Matt 
Dennerline who came in 10th place.
The runners had to overcome 
the hot weather before taking the 
lead at IUP. We had a smart race. 
We let the other teams go out too 
fast, and we were able to pick up 
places in the end, said Donner. 
The IUP course made the hot run 
more bearable with its open ter
rain and variety of upward and 
downward sloping hills.
Teamwork was another ele
ment that contributed to the suc
cessful meet. We did a good job of 
keeping our top runners together 
through the race, said Oldham. 
Its much easier to run when 
youre running with someone.
There were four of us up there 
right in the front. I thought, We
should definitely win this unless 
one of us dies or something, 
said Kreichbaum.
Luckily, no one died, and the 
men took several top spots due 
to perseverance, teamwork, and 
great coaching. Coach Meckley 
is a great coach. I dont think 
anybody can do a better job, 
said Kreichbaum.
Following the coachs order, the 
top five runners from the mens 
team did not participate in the 
meet at Cal State last weekend so 
they could concentrate on perform
ing well at IUP and an important 
meet coming up this weekend an 
Dickinson. Coach just wanted us 
to rest up, I think, said 
Kriechbaum. Even without the top 
runners, however, the team took 
third place at the Cal State meet.
With their recent successes, the 
prospects for both the womens and 
mens teams look positive for the 
upcomingmeetthis Saturday. Long 
runs during practice in the begin
ning of the week, followed with 
lighter runs right before the meet 
should ensure another successful 
finish for the Tartan runners.

SOCCER, from page 16
The 9-0 lead stuck. 
Chatham did not come back. 
At all. CMU launched 49 
shots during the game, 23 
of which were on net. 
Chatham managed no 
shots. Smith touched the 
ball once and Summers did 
not touch the bail once. The 
strong defense was a goal of 
the team after being outshot 
in previous games,.
It was a wonderful game 
as CMU dominated every 
minute of the match,, said 
coach Heather Kendra. It 
was a total team effort as 
every single team member 
contributed to the victory.

Lechleitner. The pair had nine and 11 kills, 
respectively. Also, junior Beth Sekowski 
played an errorless match, with eight kills 
and a hitting percentage of .471.
This win left CMU only one victory from 
sweeping their outmatched opponents. To 
the Chatham teams credit, though, they 
did not let CMU get away without a fight.
The third game went very much like the 
previous one. Chatham seemed to improve 
as the match went on, and the scoreboard 
reflected that. The Tartans trailed for much 
of the first half of the third game. In addition, 
Webb rotated nearly all of her bench into the 
game, which may also have contributed to
the close score. Finally, however, the Tartans 
pulled away and took the third match 15-8, 
and sweeping their Shadyside neighbors.
Despite the sweep, the CMU volleyball 
team was not satisfied, especially coming off 
strong performances at home last weekend 
when the team-went 9-2. We won the match, 
but the team as well as myself were disap
pointed in not winning more decisively than 
we did, said Webb.
Last weekend, the team traveled to Cleve

Reserve. Before the match, Webb commented, 
The team is completely psyched up to win 
and crush Case for the first time since the 
upperclassmen have been at Carnegie Mellon.wins again at home

is an improvement over last 
is the depth of our team,

depth has increased overall 
team confidence.
That confidence is well-founded. 
Tlae Tartans rolled to an easy vic
tory over W&J. The depth of the 
lineup was especially apparent in 
th is match, as the Tartans clearly 
dominated all afternoon.
The match started with

The domination 
continued in the 
singles sets as ev
ery Tartan won her 
respective match, 
and no one needed 
more than two sets 
to do it. Standouts 
in the list of CMU 
points were Mills, 
who shut out her

and Chanopas and 
Palermo-, who both 
won convincingly.

which I think is a first since Ive

According to head coach Pete 
Moss, the Tartans success this 
year can be attributed to a combi
nation of experience as well as 
new talent. Mills and Brown have 
returned strong this season.
The Tartans competed in the 
Flower City Tournament last week
end in Rochester. They played 
Swarthmore University and the 
University of Rochester. The Uni
versity of Rochester, one of the top 
UAA teams, has given the Tartans 
problems in the past, but the team 
was confident that their added 
depth will negate this history.
This weekend will indicate 
where we are, said Moss. Were 
looking forward to these matches

we still need to work on.

Football crushes Bethany
By RICH TORIO
Taaean SeaffwaueEa
The game was close  in the first 
quarter. After scratching and clawing 
through the first two weeks of the sea
son on the road, the Tartans proved that 
theres no place like home, trampling 
the Bethany Bison 38-7 in the home 
opener. Nearly two thousand rowdy fans 
witnessed the bloody Bison beating last
Saturday night, and seven male Tartan 
supporters even felt compelled to bare 
their chests and cover their bodies with 
red and blue war paint.
It was a rip-roaring good time for ev
eryone present  except, of course, for 
the Bison.
At the beginning of the game, it looked 
like it was going to be close. Junior 
kicker Pat OMalley drove the opening 
kickoff to the Bethany 17-yard line, and

Zitelli stuffed the return man at the 20. 
The Bison looked impressive on their 
first drive; stringing together eight plays 
over the first five minutes, they moved 
the ball into Tartan territory and looked 
poised to score.
With 10:09 showing on the clock, the 
ball rested on the Carnegie Mellon 32  
fourth down and 1 yard to go. Bethany 
opted to go for it, and their running back 
plunged into the line. Junior and senior 
linebackers Tom Colan and Mike Stango 
met the Bison back in the hole for no 
gain, snuffing out the Bethany drive. 
That would be the closest the Bison 
would come to the end zone against the 
Tartans first-team defense.
The ball turned over to the Tartan 
offense on downs but only for a brief 
stint. Junior quarterback Russ Clay, 
junior fullback Mike Campie, and se
nior running back Bryan Kreuger ran 
the ball directly at the Bison with little 
success. Three runs went for 8 yards, 
and OMalley was forced to punt the 
ball away.
Bethany took the field at their 23- 
yard line after the punt and again moved 
the ball effectively. On first down, a 
Bison receiver caught a short pass and 
turned it into a big play, breaking tack
les and running for a 39-yard gain.

First andlO at the CMU 38, the Bison 
ran for four more yards. Second down 
and six to go, the Bison once again were 
in position to score; however, an un
timely clipping penalty killed the drive. 
Two plays later, Bethany punted the 
ball back to the Tartans.
With 5:50 left in the first quarter, the 
Tartans took over at their 19-yard line 
and took over the game for good. Head 
coach Rich Lackner opened up the ofuiiciii aaaaataar lauaii o|jui is SAaSAa

three different receivers: Krueger, se

quarter began with Clay hitting a streakihgBarnicle over the middle for a 17-yard

Tartans win pair versus Chatham
Volleyball slips by with victory
By BRIAN SMITH
Taaean SlCaeg MiueCa
Chatham College. When these 
words are said in athletic circles 
at Carnegie Mellon, the first 
thought that comes to many 
peoples minds is victory. This is 
with good reason, too. Last year, 
the CMU womens basketball 
team won 79-19. This year, the 
womens tennis team swept 
Chatham 9-0, and just this past 
week, the Tartans womens soc
cer team won 9-0 in a game that 
saw a shot differential of 49-0.
In that spirit of domination, 
the Carnegie Mellon womens volleyball team took on our 
Shadyside neighbor last Tuesday 
in Skibo Gym. This match was 
going to be a true test of our
The second match saw CMUs 
domination, as well as the quick 
flow of the game, fall off. It is 
very difficult to play at your own 
level against a team that plays a 
very slow-paced game, said 
Webb. It was hard to stay fo
cused and play defense because 
they were very random with their 
shots and hard to read.
Chathams unorthodox play 
lead to confusion on Carnegie 
Mellons side of the court, and the 
Tartans found themselves trail
ing early. They did not have that 
many attacks, but we also could 
have picked up a lot of balls that 
dropped, said Webb.
A decline in average digs per 
game illustrated this. The Tar
tans average 16 digs per game but 
were only able to get 12 against
Junior Ashley Kinsey tips the ball over a pair of Chatham blockers.
character because we were a 
much more skilled team, said 
head coach Julia Webb.
The match turned out to be 
more challenging than expected. 
The first game went pretty much 
according to CMUs plan, and the 
Tartans won decisively, 15-2. 
Junior Sarah Putaro led the team 
with a match-average 10 assists 
per game.
Chatham. Juniors Stephanie 
Szobota and Rachelle Abati led 
the team in digs, averaging 2.6

of play, and emerged victorious

Soccer adds win to record
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Taaean Areuns NEwg MiueCa
Carnegie Mellons womens 
soccer team continued the Tar
tan tradition of dominating 
Chatham College in athletics 
last Wednesday with a 9-0 
romp at Gesling Stadium.
The game boosted the teams 
record to 4a-2 and gave them 
a three-game winning streak 
going into last Sundays game 
against UAA opponent Wash
ington University.
Chatham will be a good 
chance to find our game and 
try new things, things that we 
might find can help us to beat 
Wash U., said senior co-cap
tain and goalie Lindsay Smith.
The team got a quick start 
against Chatham and quiickly 
established dominance of'the 
. game, Chatham wasnt;'- al
lowed: out of their end of. the 
;field with the ball for more 
;than a few moments, and the 
Tartan defense made sure that 
Chatham didnt earn a shot in 
the entire game.
The opening minutes of* the 
game provided numerous op
portunities for the Tartans. A 
few flurries of action took 
place in front of the Chatham 
net. CMU was able to force 
the ball to the front of the net 
and control the ball and the 
field. However, the first goal 
didnt come on a prolonged 
possession. Inst6ad, first-year 
student Ashley Wermine took 
the ball from midfield on a 
fast break. Wermine beat 
three Chatham defenders and 
pulled up in the box to take a 
shot that beat the Chatham 
goalie to the near post.
After Chatham kicked off, 
CMU quickly regained con
trol of the ball. For more than
10 minutes the Tartans con
trolled play before junior co
captain Romy Fischer 
knocked a corner kick into the 
net for a 2-0 lead.
With 14 minutes left in the 
first half, Carnegie Mellon ex
tended its lead to 3-0 when firstyear student Kari Pylypyshyn 
took a long shot that bounced in 
front of the Chatham goalie and 
into the net.
Junior Courtney Marrett 
took a cross from sophomore 
Christy Kelly and scored the 
last goal of the half.
The Tartans went into halftime with a 4-0 lead. CMU 
dominated the second half just 
as easily as the first. Sopho
more Alex Summers took over in 
goal and most of the starters 
watched the game from the bench 
for the second half. The depth of 
the team became evident.
Kelly set up the opening goal of 
the half with a cross that junior 
Renee Habib ran under and 
booted into the goal.
Carnegie Mellon continued to 
put pressure on the Chatham 
Cougars in an effort to put the 
offense into high gear for the rest 
of the season. Smith, now playing 
in the field rather than goal, 
earned an assist when she re
ceived a throw in. She then passed 
the ball to Pylypyshyn who was 
streaking toward the net. She 
struck the ball in full stride, test
ing the strength of the back of the 
net, and gave CMU a 6-0 lead.
The score stuck for most of the 
rest of the half, but with six min
utes left, the Tartans made one 
final push and netted three goals 
in the remainder of the game.
First-year student Amy Solana 
first removed the distraction of 
the Chatham defender by faking 
her out with the ball and then 
shot the ball into the upper cor
ner of the net.
Senior Tracy Burton, who had 
other chances earlier in the game, 
dribbled the ball into Chathams 
penalty box, then passed the ball 
back to sophomore Kim Celone 
who shooting the ball low and 
hard past the Chatham goalie.
With only a minute left, Burton 
capped off CMUs night with a 
goal off of a corner kick from firstyear student Melanie Stawartz.

Teams preserve 
flawless record

Taaean Manasuns MiueCa
Invitational races overthe past 
two weekends gave new mean
ing to the words runners high 
for the CMU mens and womens 
cross country teams. Last week
end at Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania (IUP) and the 
weekend before last at Califor
nia State University, the Tar
tans swept their opponents in 
heated races to the finish line.
In the womens meet last 
weekend, senior Maureen 
McGranaghan took first place, 
followed by senior Margaret 
Powers in fourth place 
and freshman Brook 
Cutler in fifth 
The top performances 
were especially excit
ing last week because 
the womens team com
peted on a Division II 
track rather than Divi
sion III, since IUP is a 
Division III school. The 
race was increased by 
one kilometer, from a 
5K to a 6K, but this 
turned out to be an ad
vantage for the women 
as McGranaghan used 
the last mile to pull 
herself from second to 
first place.
I thought under the 
conditions, the girls ran 
very smart. With the 
race longer, the last 
mile really helped us.
It really worked to [McGranaghans] advantage, said Dario 
Donatelli, coach for the womens 
cross country team.
This week, the women prepare 
themselves for what might be the 
toughest meet until nationals. They 
will be in Dickinson, Penn, along 
with 35 other schools, seven of 
which are nationally ranked. [The 
race] will give me an idea of where 
we realiy stand, said Donatelli.
We lost people to graduation, 
so we were apprehensive going 
into the season. said 
McGranaghan. The new people 
have really stepped up, though, 
so we were really enthusiastic.

Music from the Masters
According to the Activities Board, Bruce Springsteen 
once played here at CMU for the amazing fee of 
$7000. It could happen, honest. Just ask these 
students about their aspirations. They may have more 
stories you can learn from.
How Not to be Successful
To not rehearse. Sometimes we had trouble getting 
rehearsals together and so we didnt do much the last part 
r. ' last year. You really need to rehearse to the point where 
you feel comfortable with the material.  Jonathan Sung,
sophomore, English, Quiddity
How to Find Great Success
Make sure you get along with the rest of the musicians. 
Sometimes, things dont go well if theres tension. You should 
have good relations on the personal level as well as the musical 
level."  George Chow, senior, industrial design, 29
How to Get a Gig
You really have to go to the place and talk to the manager. Its 
not enough tojust call the place.... You need to be there in person 
and looking willing to play and ready to go. You have to show that you 
know what youre doing and youre not just some idiot with a guitar 
lookingto play... Make it look like youre a professional.  Jonathan 
Sung /'' f '
Like I said, there are a couple of courses you can take here.... 
Computer music is not only music but its very complicated too. You 
have to know about computers and electronics. I have spec sheets 
that i wouldn't be able to read if I werent an ECE major.... Just 
because you only have a computer and sound card, you shouldn't be 
put off.... Whatever equipment you have, you can still get experience. 
 Chris Weller, junior, electrical and computer engineering, producer 
of electronic music
The most imporant thing is to have a demo.... You need to have 
an hour or two of demo and then you just give it to several clubs so 
ineycan see ifyou'reagood band to book forthat club.... The music
oene in any town is just there for the taking. To get all the success
ou want, you have to go get it yourself  there are no freebies.... 
People are dying to hear good music. You just have to step up and 
j play for them. After that, everything snowballs, and shows and 
iccordings happen.  Brendan Bosworth, Senior, English, Red 
Star Mission
How to Form a Band
"You want to try to find people with similar interests as you ... 
You want to develop a synergy among everyone so that the group 
is greater than the sum of its parts.  Michael Fisher, senior,
history, developing artist
How Not to Form a Band
"Play with as many musicians as possible and dont get 
strapped down with the idea of a band.... Enjoy it for the 
music, don't let rock star ambitions get out of control."  
Brenden Bosworth
If You Dont Want to F$@% Up a Gig
 If you make a commitment to a gig, you better show 
up. People dont like ft if you dont show up on time.
You shouldn't be setting up when you have to go on.
Have a set list ready so you don't have discuss what 
song youre going to play next.  George Chow

CMU bands start on road to success

You saw it in their eyes. Ted Theodore Logan and William 
S. Preston, Esq. had passion as they played their guitars 
in San Dimas, California. These guys had a bogus start 
playing in a garage. But little did Bill and Ted know about the 
Excellent Adventure awaiting them.
Even though there are only a few garages at CMU, students 
have the same vision  making music of their own to the delight 
of their audiences. It is not easy to balance such a time-consum
ing activity with an already busy schedule. But with a passionate 
vision, the extra work can be an even more excellent journey 
through CMU.
The members of one band, Red Star Mission, have had a long 
trip since arriving on campus three years ago. You may not 
recognize the name of the band, however, since the groups name

has been changed many times.
Weve basically had a million names ... Pocket, Science 
Project, Daves Science Project, and now Red Star Mission, 
said Brendan Bosworth, senior English major and guitarist for 
Red Star Mission.
In fact, the members and their music have changed almost as 
frequently as the name. Currently, the members are senior 
electrical and computer engineering major and drummer An
drew Artz, senior music major Ross Garin on trombone, senior 
music major David Saenz on saxophone, and senior English 
"major Ben Schultz. This year though, the band plays a rocktinged jazz-funk, according to its members. They would rather 
have their audience determine the name of their exact style of 
music, however.
We want people to come so they can tell us what our music 
sounds like, because its hard for us to determine it objectively 
and everyone who listens to it has a different interpretation, 
said Bosworth.
People can find the band playing around Pittsburgh, as Red 
Star Mission hopes to extend their range beyond campus.
Weve done a lot of campus coffeehouses and a lot of base
ment parties. [Our goal is] to play out as much as we can this 
year, to have our audience go beyond the CMU campus, 
said Bosworth.
We started playing in Pittsburgh toward the end of the 
summer, including a couple of gigs in South Side, said 
Schultz. We also played at Pre-College here, in McConomy 
[Auditorium]. Red Star Mission had their first perfor
mance of the semester last Thursday at The Next Decade in 
Oakland.
Other CMU bands, such as the jazz band 29, can often be 
found playing on campus. Weve been playing in Skibo Coffee
house and at numerous gigs, like the CFA Awards Ceremony, 
some charity events, and even some private parties given 
by professors, said George Chow, senior design major and 
drummer for 29. We play around as much as possible and have 
a blast.
The jazz quartet has been around for a couple of years, but 
like Red Star Mission, they have changed their lineup several 
times. This year they had to find replacements for departed 
members. Fortunately, it did not take long to fill the spot 
at bass.
I met George at Orientation. He helped me move into my 
room and then we talked jazz, said Matthew Arnoff, a firstyear music major and the new bassist for 29. Even though 
I played his drumset with juggling pins, he still let me play 
them at the talent show.
The members of 29 (Arnoff, senior industrial design major

Musicians devote time despite pressures

Brian Cooke plays his guitar a lot. Maybe too much. 
He sometimes plays guitar instead of studying.
Such is the plight of being in a band, or being a 
musician. Cooke, a sophomore English major, and his 
friend Jonathan Sung, also a sophomore English 
major, are Quiddity, an acoustic band that started last 
year. Though both feel they have handled the balance 
between their music and studies well, an intense love 
of music and an equally intense creative energy can 
sometimes complicate things.
I always wind up playing guitar and an hour later 
realizing that I should have been studying, Cooke said. 
Cooke and Sung have been playing together since their 
earliest moments on campus. The two met on the first day 
of Orientation their freshman year. Sung was sitting in his 
room playing the guitar part of What Would You Say by 
The Dave Matthews Band, and Cooke stuck his head in the 
door. The two began to jam together, and later that week 
played at the Orientation Talent Show.
I came to school last year looking for two things: a band and a 
girlfriend, Cooke said. I found the band in the first hour.

New program facilitates search for career
By KATIE MARTINEZ
Taaean JonuCa SeaffwaueEa
For a lot of students on campus, the 
Career Center is an unknown realm 
tucked away in the basement of 
Warner Hall. However, the peer career 
advisor (PCA) group, a new addition to 
the Center this year, is trying to 
change some of the more hesitant atti
tudes toward resume reviews and 
internship searching.
The program allows students to 
meet with other students for help in 
particular areas, thereby creating a 
more familiar and comfortable atmos
phere. The advisors, as students 
themselves, are able to empathize 
with students who come in for assis
tance, since some of the advisors are 
going through the same kinds of 
ordeals, such as searching for a job or 
applying to graduate school.
Students can talk to [other] students 
as a first step, rather than going 
immediately to a professional, said 
Rachel Zsembery, a junior architecture 
major and PCA.
The Career Center instituted the 
PCA program as a means for students
to get help with a variety of job-orient
ed tasks, such as writing resumes and 
cover letters, finding internships, and 
applying to graduate school. The pro
gram consists of six career advisors, 
each of which has a different area of 
expertise, such as job searching, gradu
ate school application processes, and 
even selection of majors.
Although the program is new this 
year, the idea of having PCAs has been 
in the works for quite a while. Last 
year, advertisements were put up in 
search of students interested in 
becoming a PCA, and those interested 
went through an application process 
followed by an intensive three-day 
training period.
The advisors had different reasons 
for getting involved, centering around 
the desire to provide a service to CMU 
students. I wanted to do something 
that would make me feel like I was 
doing something good for the campus 
community, said Zsembery.
I thought it was a really cool idea 
because it makes connections between 
staff and students, said Kelly Lynema, 
a junior English major and public 
relations PCA.
>k
An additional benefit of the program 
is the availability of immediate assis
tance to students who need it. Many of 
the main career consultants are booked 
with appointments weeks ahead of 
time, and some of the problems stu
dents bring to the Career Center 
require more immediate attention.
I really appreciate the peer advisors, 
because if they werent there to help, 
Id have to go to my career consultant, 
and its pretty difficult to schedule an 
appointment with her, said Lisa Don, 
a senior psychology major.
The PCA program has walk-in hours, 
and students can generally schedule an 
appointment just a day in advance 
instead of waiting up to two weeks to 
see a career consultant.
The peer career advisor program 
makes things in the Career Center-run 
more efficiently, said Anne Devine, a 
senior chemical engineering major and 
job search and graduate school PCA.
Lately, the Career Center has been 
seeing significantly more business 
because of the upcoming Technical 
Opportunities Conference (TOC) and 
Business Opportunities Conference 
(BOC), at which students are able to
meet with and submit their resumes to! 
a multitude of corporations. This, 
influx of traffic at the Career Center; 
has been positive for the publicity of! 
the PCAs. The advisors hope that this 
sort of publicity will encourage more; 
people to utilize the Career Center and; 
the new program.
A lot of students have found out; 
about the program inadvertently, said 
Lynema. They walk in for resume; 
reviews, and they see us.
I hadnt heard about the program; 
until my friend talked about it, and it' 
seemed like a really good idea, said 
Jeff Chung, a senior industrial man
agement major. I dont go to the; 
Career Center very much, but now that; 
I know I can get help really easily, Ill; 
probably go check it out.
There are no definite plans for the; 
future of the program at the moment.; 
How things go this year will deter
mine whether or not this program con
tinues, but I think its a really good; 
idea, said Lynema.
Zsembery is confident that the PCA; 
program will continue beyond this year.; 
People that we have seen are really; 
happy with it, she said.

TYE Taaean: Can you explain a little 
more about the scholarship and how 
you won it?
LaoaEn Gaarua: Its from PRSA, and 
its called the Student Renaissance 
Award. Every year, the Pittsburgh 
chapter puts out an application 
for this award throughout western 
Pennsylvania schools. Theyre looking 
for students who have shown interest 
in the public relations field. They also 
see if youre doing well in school and if 
youre giving back to the community.
Monica Mayk, a University of 
Pittsburgh student, and I won the 
award. Robert OGara, education chair 
for the chapter, said the judges were 
fighting over who should win the award. 
In the end, they awarded it to both us.
TT: What was your application 
process like for the scholarship?
LG: Karen Schnakenberg of the 
English Department announced this 
scholarship to us, but I only had a week 
to do it. There were four essays I had to 
write. The first one was, Why do you 
want to get into public relations? The 
rest of the essays dealt with specific 
public relations issues. For example, 
one question was, With the global 
economy, how should public relations 
workers educate themselves, and how 
will that change the profession?
TT: How did you answer that?
LG: Im also a Spanish major, so the 
global economy is something Im inter
ested in. Its going to be extra impor
tant for public relations workers to 
know other languages.
In business, you meet people who 
speak other languages. When you greet 
them and talk with them in their lan
guage, it can really open a door and 
make them happy, which is the job of a 
public relations person. So my essay 
primarily dealt with that, the different 
languages and cultures.
TT: Why are you so interested in pub
lic relations?
LG: Ive always been a mediator in 
arguments  the middle person is basi
cally what public relations is. I like see
ing both sides of the issue. For example, 
I like seeing what goes on from the busi
ness side and then looking at what the 
public thinks about it. I also like people, 
and I love to write. I love to be out there 
and talking to people.
I tried journalism, but J didnt like it 
because it doesnt have the inside ele
ments of public relations. When youre
in public relations, you put your 
heart into it, and you try to be an 
advocate on the part of your compa
ny. This summer, I worked for the 
Center of Emergency Medicine, and 
I had to write announcements for 
the company. I really believed in 
what I was writing.
Another part of public relations 
that you dont get to do in journal
ism is organizing special events, 
such as press conferences.
TT: Since CMU doesnt offer a 
public relations major, how are you 
preparing for a career in that field?
LG: I think that the reason why 
Monica and I won the scholarship is 
because Pitt and CMU do not have 
public relations majors. I take pro
fessional writing because it focuses 
on the writing aspect.
I find my own opportunities 
through jobs. Right now, Im writ
ing for Paramount Pictures. Im 
also trying to start a public rela
tions club because I know there are 
a lot of people who are interested in 
the field but dont know how 
approach it.
In addition, Im working on my per
sonal skills so I can go up to people and 
be assertive in order to get their com
ments on particular issues.
TT: What does your current job with 
Paramount Pictures involve?
LG: Im a field publicist for them. 
Basically, when they call me, I have to 
promote a new movie in my area. I 
recently did A Night at the Roxbury, 
and I got to set up the screening and

promote it. Its a lot of fun.
The only downside is that I have to; 
see movies several times. I saw TYE 
Taoman SYCw three times and TYE 
Oii pCollE II four times.
TT: What are your post-graduate' 
plans in the field of public relations?
LG: I want to enroll in the MA in.

because they have a special corporate, 
communications concentration which 
partly deals with public relations.

You're embarking on your job search and you know two things; you're inter
ested in consulting and you're psyched by Internet technology and new 
media. But given the panoply of options in these areas in this digital econ
omy, where should you go?
Corporate IT seems like a logical place to start, but after further investiga
tion, you just don't share the excitement of those IT professionals who ded
icate years to COBOL programming and Y2K projects. Design shops seem 
neat and cool, but you crave more substance and want to learn more than 
just how to design jazzy interfaces. Meanwhile, traditional strategy consul
tants dedicate all their time to high-level frameworks that are too theoreti
cal to be practical in the digital space; sure they publish very intelligent 
research reports about emerging technologies, but is it likely that they will 
be able to execute their recommendations?
At Viant, technologists, strategists, and designers work together on intimate 
project teams clustered throughout our open office space. This integrated 
work approach supports what we believe is our competitive edge in the 
world of building online ventures: the fusion of technology, strategy, and 
creative. Our on-going effort to sustain a 'start-up' feel is evident in our 
unique working environment: wide-open floor space without any cubicles, 
offices or closed doors to obstruct the free flow of ideas and innovative 
thinking; where a new-hire just 2 months out of school can quite poten
tially sit face to face with Bob, our CEO. Our value of placing no rankings 
or titles encourages anyone and everyone to be aggressive and take chal
lenges that will help the company grow even faster than it has in the last 2 
years. If you're ready to take part in this unique challenge, find us on cam
pus this fall!

Sculptor offers chairs to UC art gallery visitors

Tartan Staffwriter

Art Gallery, one cant help wanting to

sit down. Associative Seating is the new 
gallery exhibit that includes handmade 
chairs. The sculptural work by 
Margaret Powers, a senior art major, 
has a dual purpose, serving as func
tional seating as well as 
artistic expression.
Powers has been working 
on furniture pieces for a lit
tle over a year. She enjoys 
using chairs as a subject 
because they allow her to 
work with a variety of 
materials she likes, specifi
cally wood, metal, and fab
ric. She also enjoys making 
chairs because she feels 
that their functionality 
makes them easier for the 
viewer to interact with. 
She hopes this makes each 
piece more approachable.
I feel there is a much more 
intimate connection with 
the viewer when they expe
rience sitting in the piece, 
she said. The subject is 
also partly due to thematic 
issues of support and how 
easily the chair lends itself 
toward the figurative, 
according to Powers. 
[Margaret] puts a lot of 
time and effort into her
work, and I think [all her work] shows 
that, said Andrea Byrnes, a junior 
computer science major and Powers 
teammate on the Carnegie Mellon 
cross country and track teams.
One piece that clearly stands out in 
the exhibit because of its fine details 
and woodworking is the Grasp Chair, 
which is made from walnut, poplar, and 
upholstery. Powers completed this 
chair while working this summer 
under Stephen LaDrew, who special
izes in handmade furniture. During 
this time, she was able to learn more 
about joinery and construction, and 
about woods and machinery that she 
had not used before.
While working on the Grasp Chair, 
Powers found many old clothes and 
scrap fabrics. I wanted to turn them 
into something and make them useful 
again, she said. Out of these scraps, 
she designed a piece titled Excess, 
using a cesca chair frame with metal 
signs on the back, old fabrics for the 
cushioning, and a flowing piece from 
the back of the chair of quilted fabrics. 
I like people to be able to touch the 
work, she said.
Two-dimensional representations of 
chairs and designs are hung along the 
gallery walls. By bringing the process 
of drawing and planning alongside her 
work, the artist hopes to provide viewAnthony DAuria/Tartan Junior Staff

ers with a level of depth and interpre
tation that they would not normally 
witness in its final stage.
After Powers graduates, she hopes to 
continue to apprentice with people who 
work with studio furniture in different 
capacities. Through such a position,- 
she would like to to get a better idea of 
what materials and forms she would 
like to continue working with.
[Through the exhibit] I hope people 
see more possibilities in things in their 
own environment, said Powers.
The UC Art Gallery is located on the 
first floor of the University Center. It is 
open Monday through Friday from 
noon to 5 pm each week. Associative 
Seating will be on display until 
September 25.
Philosopher sparks thought on artificial intelligence
By ROSIE JONES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
\ This talk consists of halfbaked ideas. Im looking for 
responses to help me bake 
them, said philosopher Daniel 
Dennett before his talk at CMU 
last Thursday. Im heartened to 
see this group of people come 
out to see a philosopher. 
Dennett, professor of philoso
phy and director of the Center 
for Cognitive Science at Tufts 
University, spoke at CMU about 
Modeling Creativity: Some
Speculations about the Speed of 
Thought. He is the author of 
several books on cognition and 
volution, including Darwins 
Dangerous Idea (1995) and 
Consciousness Explained (1991). 
! CMU students knew what 
there was to be gained from the 
talk. The role of philosophy is
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Staff 
Dennett demonstrated the poten
tial for truly intelligent machines.
to point out directions for com
puter science  and kick its ass 
when it gets out of line, said 
James Thomas, a graduate stu
dent in computer science.
Dennett started the evening 
by explaining that while many 
believe strong artificial intelli
gence (AI) is possible in princi
ple, the question remains 
whether it is possible in prac
tice. Strong AI is the theoretical 
ability for a machine to truly 
think or be intelligent, as 
opposed to just simulating the 
behavior of an intelligent agent 
without actually having any 
thinking abilities..
He defined creativity as a twopart process. The first part is 
generating many possibilities 
 brainstorming, in essence. 
The second part is selecting the 
best of the generated ideas. He 
justified his definition by saying 
that while many people are 
unaware of the precise steps 
they take in heir creative acts, 
much of the process consists of 
generating and discarding ideas.
In this way, creativity and evo
lution are two sides of the same 
coin. An apple pie is as much of 
a biological product as an 
apple, said Dennett. He also 
pointed out that one of the goals 
of current research in strong AI 
is possibly the ultimate creative 
act: The artificial mind as a 
model of creativity.
Dennett continued with this 
theme by playing a Bach-like 
composition written by a piece of 
software called Experiments in 
Musical Imagination (EMI), 
written by David Cope. EMI has 
its own CD, and has been put 
through a creativity test which 
demonstrated its intelligence. 
In this test, humans were asked 
to listen to lesser-known pieces 
written by composers such as 
Bach and Puccini, and similar 
pieces composed by EMI, and 
decide which was written by the
man and which by the machine. 
At the lecture, EMI slipped at 
least one composition past every 
member of the audience, which 
contained professional musi
cians as well as scientists.
Dennett showed videos of 
creatures created by a soft: 
ware simulation of evolution. He 
noted that one of the limitations 
inherent in simulated evolution 
is the necessity to build in all of
The role of philosophy is to point 
out directions for computer science 
 and kick its ass when it gets out 
of line. 
 James Thomas, CS grad student
Still, Dennett noted, the actu
al creativity of EMI is limited. 
Cope also fed his own composi
tions as training data to EMI 
and would occasionally ask it for 
advice, he said. He was 
amazed by how dull the emerg
ing material could be.

-Lthe resources the- model might 
need during its lifetime. This is 
because the genetic component 
of the simulation program is 
outside the model itself, where 
the creatures exist, and so the 
genetic material cannot be inter
nally modified.
He contrasted this with an 
evolutionary model built with 
robots interacting in a physical 
environment in a lab. The robots 
evolved into two different 
groups, one nocturnal and one 
diurnal. The different evolutions 
were the result of some of the 
environmental conditions deter
mined by daylight coming 
through the windows while the 
experiment was running. 
Dennett noted that such 
changes in condition could not 
have occurred in a virtual world.
His central theme revolved 
around this idea of artificial 
models of intelligence and cre
ativity requiring external input 
to be successful. In order to be 
rich enough, these models 
require noise  extraneous 
input from the environment  
to act as raw material for cre
ativity. One feature of computer 
modeling, the ability to control 
for all but the important vari
ables, may be precisely what 
prevents it from achieving goals 
of open-ended modeling of intel
ligence, including that of 
human creativity. Such control 
eliminates all of the back
ground noise present in the 
real world.
It was an interesting talk, 
but not earth-shattering, said 
Kevin Lenzo, a graduate stu
dent in robotics.
Lenzo also mentioned that a lot 
of research on genetic algorithms 
has been done at CMU. It was 
nothing controversial, but a 
thoughtful critique, he said. 
[Still], its always good to see 
these big names do their thing.
Others enjoyed the humor and 
novelty of Dennetts talk and 
took home ideas for their own 
work. Creative noise is any
thing you can use to problemsolve, said Judy Rudovsky, a 
junior art and philosophy double 
major. Ill store [the talk] in my 
creative noise bank.

Folk singer intrigues writer
By ROB THORNTON
Taaean JonuCa SeaffwaueEa
Sue Garner, who usually 
sings and plays bass for the 
New York avant-rock band Run 
On, brought her own act to the 
University Centers Connan 
Room last Tuesday night. Her 
husband and fellow Run On 
member Rick Brown opened 
for Garner as part of Les Bat
teries, an unusual rock percus
sion duo, followed by veteran 
Pittsburgh rockers, The 
Johnsons.
Garners show, sponsored by 
the Activities Board, took place 
to promote her first solo re
cording, TC Ron MCaE 
f SmCCeYly, which is on Chicago 
label Thrill Jockey and is very 
different than Run Ons spiky 
take on rock music. SmCCeYly 
iis a wonderful recording with 
some great unadorned ballads 
and rockers, and it definitely 
shows off her beautiful voice. 
On the other hand, Garners 
experimental side does show 
up in her surreal lyrics (Cry 
me a river/of rose-colored glue/ 
and Ill love you/until it dries) 
and one or two tracks which 
play around with samples.
In contrast to the CD, which 
features a full band with mem
bers of Yo La Tengo and Run 
On (naturally), Garner per
formed a solo set with her gui
tar plus samplers and backup 
; tapes in front of an audience of 
approximately 50. Normally, 
backup tapes dont work very 
well, but Garner skillfully 
blended her guitar with the 
pre-recorded material, creat
ing a seamless, smooth result.
; For the show, Garner slowed
Sue Garner played for an audience in the Connan Room last week.
down many of the songs from the 
album and eliminated some of 
the vocal mannerisms present on 
SmCCeYly, allowing her to show 
off her honey-sweet alto. She also 
performed some new arrange
ments of album tunes, giving 
them an avant-garde twist with 
some weird sampled sounds. All 
in all, Garners show was well 
worth the money.
Unfortunately, the same cant 
Fe said about Les Batteries, which 
featured Brown and French 
drummer Guigou Chenevier of 
the French avant-prog band 
Volapuk on two drum sets, plus a 
few sequenced synth riffs and 
vocals. This duo performed inter
locking drum patterns that occa
sionally clicked, creating mon
strous tribal-type beats. But all 
too often they ended up playing 
rock drum clichs from those bor
ing extra long drum solos from
70s rock bands. The audience 
seemed to enjoy them, though, 
and its hard to criticize a rock 
drum duo who won such enthu
siastic applause.
The Johnsons opened with a 
great set of tunes. They placed 
superb 60s-style popcraft a la 
Burt Bacharach against the ap
pealingly rough-edged voices of 
vocalist/keyboardist/ 
songwriter Chris Cannon and 
second vocalist Terry Carroll. 
Their fine songs are based on 
Cannons electric piano sounds 
instead of the standard guitarbased pop songs of the 90s, 
which is really intriguing. 
These guys are well worth the 
attention, if they would bear in 
mind one piece of advice  
avoid silly pseudo-psychedelic 
lyrics like: We want to show 
you what you are/silent uncon
scious superstars.
Comics old material 
warrants new listen
By ANDY FRANCIS
Taaean SeaffwaueEa
Jerry Seinfelds first comedy 
album, Im TElluns tCo fCa eYE 
Lage TumE, is somewhat analo
gous to an unplugged perfor
mance. It retains most of the sen
sibilities of his wildly successful 
television show SEunfEli, with
out supporting characters, plots, 
or physical comedy. Still, Seinfeld 
solo is a much different experi
ence. Compared to many of 
todays comics, Seinfeld is gener
ally restrained, not relying on 
loud outbursts or abrasive lan
guage to get his point home. In
stead, he is clear, concise, and 
adept at setting up and making 
his points, skillfully crafting a 
consistent, thoughtful perfor
mance. Nontheless, this new com
pilation doesnt have the sharp
ness that Seinfeld is known for.
I Artist: Jerry Seinfeld 
I Title: Im Telling You 
] for the Last Time 
I Company: Universal
His purpose with the album, 
and the HBO special it was drawn 
from, is to retire the comedic 
style that has brought him so much 
fame and fortune. Seinfelds stock 
in trade has always been his abil
ity to pick out tiny absurdities 
from commonplace, seemingly 
normal things. He wonders why a 
scuba diver would need a water
proof wallet (Is there a sea turtle 
who can break a fifty?), or why 
McDonalds is still counting ham
burger sales. (Are cows just going 
to start surrendering?) His style
the observations are clever 
and easy to relate to, theres 
not a whole lot of innovation 
or new ideas on the disc. 
Thats not to say that the 
entire performance is a fu
neral march; Seinfeld pep
pers his dialogue with witty 
comments from start to fin
ish along with observations 
that make people stop, 
think, and of course, laugh.
Essentially, Seinfelds 
style simply doesnt trans
late well to recording. There 
are moments of brilliance, 
like his comparison of the 
Olympic biathlon to swim
ming and strangle-a-guy, 
and describing the luge as 
the only sport where you 
could have people compet
ing against their will, and it 
is based on the fact that most would be exactly the same. It

Artists debut album deserves accolades
By KATIE KOWALL
Taaean JonuCa SeaffwaueEa 
& ANNE RAY
Taaean DuvEaguCng MiueCa
The music industry has a bad habit of 
embracing the mediocre child-musicians 
of talented parents. Using the music 
family legacy to gain popularity (for 
example: Wilson Phillips, Sean Lennon), 
and producers shove these artmusic into the ear of the public, 
of talent, 
such is not the case with EagleCherry, son of well-known avantjazz musician Don Cherry, and 
sister of the successful Nehneh Cherry. 
He might be easily overlooked because 
of his famous family, but his vision and 
good sense show that he really does 
deserve the recent accolades.
Cherrys debut album, DEguaElEgg, on 
the Sony Workgroup label, has already 
rr(ade it big in Europe, and is gaining 
respect in the U.S. With nationwide and 
oyerseas touring, including a stop at 
Metropol last Friday, Cherry has gotten 
a chance to put this albums impressive 
blend of acoustic soul-folk in front of 
audiences. The catchy pop melodies give 
both his live show and the accompany
ing studio tracks an equally unique and 
refreshing sound.
Cherry and his four-piece band played 
larger venues in festivals across Europe 
after recording DEguaElEgg in Stockholm, 
Sweden. Cherry was raised in Sweden, 
moved to New York at 14 to pursue a stage 
and screen career, and then returned to 
Sweden to pursue music. While there, he 
worked with an independent label, Diesel 
Records, but recently signed with Sony.
If you want to reach the bigger audi
ences, youve gotta have [a major label], 
said Cherry. But without the indie la
bels there would be no change within the 
music industry.
;Even though hes signed with one of 
the countrys biggest record labels, which 
may be one way to account for the fabu
lous radio success of his single, Save 
Tonight, Cherry works with a smaller 
group, the Workgroup, whchhes pleased 
with. According to him, the group lets 
him accomplish his vision for his music 
and experience the discovery process 
that goes along with a first album.
You keep your mind clear, do your
thing, throw it out there, and see if any
body responds, Cherry said. I do find 
that if you know who you are musically, 
there is a certain freedom that comes. 
Cherrys discovery process  learning 
what direction to take his music and 
exploring his own style  was evident in
Fridays set at Metropol. The concert 
began with the energetic Death Defied 
By Will, a song with fun, upbeat rhymes 
that complement the instrumentation. 
Cherry did a good job of working the 
crowd, although he looked lost on stage 
at times. Indecision, one of the bands 
favorite songs, included some spectacu
lar guitar solos. At times the pattern of 
the music became too regular  verse, 
chorus, solo, and then back again.
Cherrys vocal strength is evident in 
Conversation, which evokes the emo
tions of a boy who loses faith in his 
father. The arrangement is acoustic and 
mellow, and the Hammond organ in the 
background gives the track a distinctive 
flavor. Another standout is Shooting 
Up in Vain, a song that attacks the 
issue of drug-abuse with a nitty-gritty 
blues melody that complements the mes
sage masterfully.
Occasionally, Cherrys lyrics fall short, 
as in the hit single Save Tonight, a
tune that takes the overused morningafter scenario and overuses it once again. 
In the studio version, the catchy ar
rangement saves this one from potential 
drabness. But in a live format, the vocals 
seemed somewhat muddled, and this 
became worse as the volume was pumped
up for the bands final song. Add a strange 
sound technique that caused Cherrys 
voice to echo so badly that his words 
became muffled, and Save Tonight lost 
some of its studio quality.
In the next few months, Cherry plans 
to take a break at Christmas and record 
a new album, hopefully this time with 
more electricity, more volume. With this 
tour, hes surely gained many dedicated 
fans, and critical acclaim to make the 
public watch for his next move. As for 
focus, a genuine personality, and a 
unique musical style, its all there, and 
hes far from weary of the road.
The [live show] is the payoff. This is 
what its all about, he said.
As a whole, DEguaElEgg is all we can 
expect out of an angst-ridden secondgeneration musician  and a lot more. 
Cherry is ready for the music industry, 
both in word and action.

Eagle-Eye Cherrys album DEguaElEgg was recorded in Stockholm, Sweden.

ENERGY, from page LI
Ever since then, the two 
have played together with any 
other musicians they can find.
They have played with drum
mers, bass guitarists, and fe
male vocalists. Theyll play 
anything acoustic, but their 
love of music is what keeps 
them going, regardless of how 
difficult gigs become.
For other musicians, such as 
junior electrical and computer 
engineering major Chris 
Weller, class is a help rather 
than a hinderance. Weller 
writes electronic dance music 
using synthesizers, effects pro
cesses, and samplers. He uses 
most of his spare time to write 
music, even in class. As an ECE 
major, his love for techno 
prompted him to utilize his 
knowledge from class in con
tinuing to make music. Even 
before he came to CMU, Weller 
had developed a strong interest chris WeMer performed at a rave sponsored by 
in techno music. WRCT that took place last semester.
In high school, our computer 
lab bought a Roland sound card,
Weller said. I got to have a lot of fun 
with it and I eventually bought my 
own. Now, Im in Pittsburgh and elec
tronic music has grown on me. Ive 
bought more equipment for producing 
music, but it started by just tinkering 
with computer music.
If you want to move to bigger things 
than just tinkering and jamming, the 
next step is to schedule performances, 
or get gigs, which arent necessarily 
the easiest part of the musical process.
Weller, who has performed at nu
merous house parties and even a rave 
in the city sponsored by WRCT, said 
that many of his problems with gigs 
come from rowdy crowds and the 
amount of equipment he has. Putting 
together a show means setting up an 
entire computer and six or seven pieces 
of equipment.
Once I had a beer spilled on my 
CPU which broke my power supply....
Weller said. Usually when Im done 
with my performance, Ill unplug my 
keyboard and stuff and move them
away from the action as much as 
possible.
For Cooke and Sung, the most har
rowing experiences are also the most 
memorable. Quiddity played three or 
four gigs last year and also played on 
the boardwalk in Ocean City, MD this 
summer, where they had their best 
experience performing together. Sev
eral innocent run-ins with the police 
involving permits, fights unrelated to 
the band, and a few drunken listeners 
led to a threat of disorderly content, 
making for what the two consider to be 
their most memorable experience 
as a band.
For these musicians, those memories 
and the thrill of the performance are 
what is most important. Neither Quid
dity nor Weller expect to make a living 
off of their homemade music anytime in 
the near future. But that wont stop 
their efforts, or the aspirations of con
certs at Giants Stadium and major record 
label deals.
Just being able to make a living some
day would be cool, said Sung.

Symphony showcases 
teenage piano player
By MELISSA MCMAHONTartan Junior Staffwriter
A quality performance by the Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra at Heinz 
Hall last Friday night left audience 
members satisfied and left me, a 
fledgling Pittsburgher, excited for 
concerts to come. In only the second 
weekend of the season, the PSO is 
already giving audiences high-class 
performances.
Last Fridays featured soloist, 15-
piece, more than the others, displayed 
the wonderful range of expertise and . 
expression that this orchestra has to 
offer. The German composers dynamic 
portrayal of remorse, longing, despair,

year-old pianist Helen Huang, performed 
Beethovens Concerto No. 1 in C Major 
stunningly, receiving an extended ova
tion from the audience. From.listening 
to her performance, you wouldnt know 
Huangs age. Huang obviously has a 
skilled ear, and her mesmerizing, capti
vating sound has the quality of a much 
more experienced player.
The orchestra was very responsive to 
Huangs cues and made impeccable en
trances, particularly the woodwinds. In 
her playing, Huang took advantage of 
the slow second movement, and the clos
ing cadenzas from the first and third 
movements gave those phrases power 
and stirring emotion.
The opening measures of Strauss 
tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra, 
(which you may recognize as the theme 
of the film 2001: Space Odyssey) 
kindled images of the vastness of 
space, and the drama and electricity 
of the work itself soon took over. A 
magnificent low-brass and low-string

Pittsburgh audiences are clearly sup
portive of this orchestra. From orches
tra reaction, its obvious how much its 
members love him as well, which has 
not always been the case throughout 
PSO history.
Another landmark in PSO history, and 
new for this season, are Green Room 
Chats, held after every performance. 
With these chats, the PSO is taking 
steps to make the experience of classical 
music more accessible to its audiences. 
Participants can mingle with PSO musi
cians, musical guests, conductors, and 
audience members to meet one another 
on an informal, individual basis.
Overall, from meeting and greeting 
PSO musicians and hearing Huangs 
fresh talent for Beethoven, the PSO 
seems to have an exceptional season 
ahead of them.
The PSO performs a series of Gershwin pieces next week. Call (412) 392-4900 for more information.
Alumnus grabs funding for filmmaking
By MARSHALL WARFIELDDossier Literary Editor 
& ANNE RAYTartan Diversions Editor
He was the creative writing majorfilmmaker. He was an active member 
offilmmaking@cmu, Carnegie Mellons 
student film group, and no one was 
ever surprised when they saw senior 
GregMarcks walking around campus 
with a camera and a vision to make 
movies. You could tell just by talking 
to him that films were his dream. And 
slowly but surely, Marcks dream is 
happening. Recently, he was honored 
with the Laura Napor Pittsburgh Film 
Grant, which provides funding for up 
and coming filmmakers.
In fact, Marcks, who graduated last 
spring, won other grants and awards 
while still at CMU. Judges for the 
Adamson Awards, CMUs under
graduate writing contest, awarded 
Marcks with prizes in the 
screenwriting category every year he 
entered  twice with first-place. 
Marcks also received grants from the 
Student Undergraduate Research 
Grant initiative and the Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers for his shorts, Lift and The Ten Commandments. Now, 
Marcks is at Florida State Univer
sity, pursuing an MFA in film and 
deciding what to do with the grant.
The prestigious Laura Napor Pitts
burgh Film Grant was awarded by the 
WRS Film Labs in Crafton, Penn. The 
prize awards a package of $5000 worth
of Kodak film stock, $ 5000 in film 
processing at WRS, and a $2500 lighting 
package from Performance Lighting. 
Marcks has a tough act to follow. Last 
years winner was local filmmaker Tony 
Buba, producer and director of the 
award-winning documentary Struggles in Steel, which was featured at the 
Sundance Film Festival.
ences as an amateur filmmaker.
I dont expect to make any money 
off this film, Marcks said. I think I 
can make a decent low-budget movie 
with this grant and whatever else we 
can scrape up. [Even] if I make this 
feature and no one saw it, Id still 
have made a feature, which is a huge 
psychological hurdle.
f have been given the opportunity to write 
and direct my own feature film. How many 
established Hollywood filmmakers have that 
kind of creative control?
____________ Greg Marcks, CMU alumnus
Applicants to the Laura Napor Con
test had to submit one sample work and 
a two-page treatment, or a brief outline 
of the intended story. Marcks submitted The Ten Commandments, a work that 
was screened at CMUs Film Fest Seven, 
an annual independent film fest spon
sored by filmmaking@cmu. For his treat
ment, he proposed a feature-length film 
called Scam.
[Scam] is essentially a religious 
parody about an unemployed guy who 
starts his own church and becomes rich 
and famous, said Marcks. The tone [of 
the piece] is black comedy.
Marcks intends to move back to Pitts
burgh to shoot the film, and call on 
contacts hes made through his experi
For Marcks, the grant is an opportunity; 
to not only achieve a long-term goal, but 
take advantage of a certain freedom not 
often given to filmmakers in Marcksplace: 
So theres a chance this project could 
be the next Clerks, said Marcks. But 
more importantly I have been given the 
opportunity to write and direct my own 
feature film. How many established, 
Hollywood filmmakers have that kind of 
creative control?
Marcks knows that moving back to; 
Pittsburgh for a long-term, unpaid posi
tion is a huge commitment, but the 
chance to make a feature film makes it 
all worth it for him. Hes looking forward 
to the challenge, while the film industry 
waits and watches.

Out of Sight
I dont know what the deal is with Hollywoods 
obsession with Elmore Leonord novels, but frankly 
Im getting annoyed. Its not that I have something 
against quirky characters. In fact I consider myself 
quite a proponent of quirk. Its just that it isnt fun 
anymore when its expected. Some of the quirks in 
this movie adaptation include: George Clooney re
prising his role as a lovable rascal, Jennifer Lopez 
| as a sexy cop whose father gives her guns for 
, presents, Steve Zahn as a former hippie turned 
' petty thief, and Don Cheadle rounding it all out as 
 a comically vicious ex-boxer. Lets all say it all

Sister Soleii
Soularium  Universal
'nr
You may have seen posters for Sister Soleil 
around campus calling the band goth/in
dustrial superstars, but the only way to 
categorize their debut, Soularium, is the 
notoriously ambiguous alternative. Al
though H. Beno and Van Christie, both 
involved in industrial projects, help out with 
programming and writing, the only indica
tion of their influence that shines through is 
a dose of electronics. Stella Katsoudas, the 
vocalist and driving force of the band, has 
instead created a poppy album centered
around her various vocal styles.
Her band mates back her with rolling 
drums, piano melodies, and funky guitar 
loops. Katsoudas pleasant vocals are both 
an advantage and disadvantage; while the 
variety prevents the album from sounding 
monotonous, it also opens up a host of com
parisons in pursuit of a reference point. 
Ruby, the Cranberries, Alanis Morissette, 
Bjork, Switchblade Symphony, and the Spice 
Girls (AOL) all come to mind in varying 
degrees. Katsoudas wrote the music with 
outside help, but sadly there is nothing to
distinguish it from your average next big 
thing electronic act.
Still, her vitriolic lyrics of broken and 
abusive relationships are alluring in a slickly 
produced way. You can tap your foot to some 
tracks and chill with others. If youre in need 
of an alternative band dressed in electron
ics, Sister Soleil is for you.  DAVE ELMANSister Soleil plays October 7 at Club Laga.
U.N.K.L.E.
Psyence Fiction  Mo Wax
U.N.K.L.E. is a collaborative project 
led by Mo Wax Recordings founder James 
Lavelle and that labels biggest star, DJ 
Shadow. Its most distinguishing feature 
is the varied vocal contributions  an 
eclectic group featuring artists as di
verse as the Beastie Boys Mike D, 
Metallicas Jason Newstead, and 
Radioheads Thom Yorke-.
On Psyence Fiction, an album where he 
wrote or co-wrote all but one of the tracks, 
Shadow gets the opportunity to work with a 
more traditional song structure  and he 
excels at it. On Bloodstain, which features 
the ethereal vocals of unknown Alice Temple, 
Shadow takes the verse-chorus-verse struc
ture to a higher level, adding typical Shadow 
beats to a layered, sampled guitar back
ground track.
Shadow made his mark in the music 
world with his incredible use of sampling 
 taking older music and, through a pro
cess of mixing, layering, and remixing, 
creating something new. His landmark 
dbut, Endtroducing..., was 100 percent 
samples, a remarkable achievement, with
its diverse but fluid feel.
Shadow still gets a chance to write grooveoriented songs, and on Unreal and 
U.N.K.L.E. Main Title Theme, he proves he 
still can.
Its clear why Lavelle. said, I couldnt have 
imagined a song like Lonely Soul on my own. 
The first four minutes seem typical (to under
state things immensely), with The Verves 
Richard Ashcroft singing lyrics such as, Im 
gonna die in a place that dont know my name, 
and Im gonna cry in a space that dont hold my 
name. But just when you think the song is 
over, it segues into a lengthy strings bridge 
conducted and written by Wil Malone (whose 
talents were also used brilliantly in Massive 
Attacks Unfinished Sympathy in 1991). Fi
nally, the song reaches its climax, bringing the^ 
strings and Ashcrofts voice together in a beau
tiful, introspective crescendo. The track con
cludes at nine minutes, five minutes after it 
first fools the listener into thinking 
it had ended.
Well done, DJ Shadow. Please continue to 
amaze us. - RYAN D. SCHILLING
Bands strive to make their mark
BANDS, from page LI
selective about whom they play 
with. As a matter of fact, they 
encourage participation from 
other musicians.
A lot of musicians hear us and 
say Mind if I join in? We dont 
mind. You got your horn or your 
guitar, you can join us, 
said Chow.
Nevertheless, one of the ulti
mate goals of the band is to 
achieve a kind of musical union 
where they know what the other 
players are going to do before it 
actually happens.
I think the great thing about 
jazz is that its really improvisational music. When soloists per
form, they put forth a great 
amount of ideas, said Adam 
Waite, a sophomore music major 
and keyboard player for the band. 
I hope as [29] goes on, well be 
able to communicate ... not 
through words, but through mu
sic, so well all be on the same 
wavelength.
Just as importantly though, the 
band wants its listeners to have
fun. They attract a diverse crowd 
and hope to bring them together 
through the bands music.
In addition to the music, its 
the people that get me moti
vated. I love seeing people 
packed at Skibo to hear us play, 
said Chow. One time we got 
people so excited, we got them 
dancing on the tables, dancing 
on the barstools, even a Congo 
Line. Never have I seen Skibo 
so animated.
The reaction of the audience 
does not go unnoticed by bands. 
Red Star Mission has expressed 
the same enjoyment from watch
ing the crowd as well and feels 
that playing music should be a 
dialogue between the performers 
and the listeners. Oftentimes, the 
vibe that comes from playing 
music is indescribable.
Why do I [play music]? Be
cause it needs to be done, said 
Shultz. I do it because I like to 
see people enjoying it as much as 
I do. I like to see that unspoken 
communication.... It really brings 
people together.

OF THE
According to evolution, people have evolved from 
apes to become the strikingly handsome and ugly 
people that you see around you now. But as Charl
ton Heston and two other astronauts found out in 
1968, planets exist where humans are prelingual 
and uncivilized while apes speak normally, use 
technology, and rule the planet. While Heston has 
survived his ordeal, memories of his experiences 
remain. He currently serves as president of the 
National Rifle Association, perhaps as a warning to. 
us all about what may happen.
Maybe if these strangers from a distant world were 
to visit us in the future, they would be kind and 
benevolent and seek to establish ties to our planet. 
But maybe not, and we will have to make plans and 
prepare for a bloody apocalypse now.

This issue of Dossier marks the premiere issue of the real volume 19. 
To those of you who are wondering why we are in our second year of 
Volume 19, we can offer no answers.
Friday evening brought us a glorious sunset, a few beers, and 
a typical night of production  except for the fact that we had 
become consumed with finding the first issue of Dossier. You see, this 
week, some doubts were raised as to whether or not this truly was our 
twentieth year.
After two hours of flipping through our morgue, the 
mystery was solved. Sadly, this issue does not mark the beginning of 
our twentieth year and our plans to put little 20s all over each issue 
was squashed.
The first issue of Dossier was October 9, 1979, only nineteen 
years ago. Perhaps our theme, Water has provided insight, rather than 
distortion. Perhaps were rambling.
This issue features a flood of new designers and writers, 
expressing water through a variety of techniques. Ed Knittel and 
Claudia Oliva made direct visual references to water in Tranquilizer 
Shot and Child Playing the Suicide Game. Jody Mihelic applied 
fluid distortion to the images for The Road to Paradise. Sharmila 
Venkatasubban washes the scene in Self-reflection right over all line 
breaks and punctuation, a sentiment echoed in the fluid forms of the 
design.
Other works included direct references to water like Justin 
Bigos Rinsing the Mugs and Anne Rays March 21, on going to 
Bridgeport. The poems designers, Freddy Anzures and Christian 
Schwartz, used images of coffee for and ramen noodles  both requir
ing water for proper enjoyment. Dave Elmans Elvis Speaks simply 
had rain and for this poem designer Elizabeth Spiridakis depicted 
Elvis Presley, who used to sweat a lot.
Our theme this semester is elements, as in the ancient ones. 
After Water, well move on to Earth, then progress to Fire, and finally 
ascend into Air. The tide of history may wash away much, but some
how these concepts have remained. Enjoy.

Speaks
It is the anniversary of Elvis' death.
Dan Rather wears a somber gray suit, 
talks of The King, Elvis Aron Presley.
Photos on screen breathe life 
into his thin days, nail down the descent 
into polyester and fat. Not a word 
about twin Jesse Garon, born blue.
Elvis' hips swivel. Mobs owned 
the days, he was awake only at nights. 
"Cardiac arrest" Dan says. Elvis was found 
on the toilet, wearing blue pajamas 
and bunny slippers. Recreational drugs 
cartwheeled through his bloodstream.
"The Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus" 
lay cracked open on the tile. He died 
a thousand deaths, everyone sells one.
This is mine.
Elvis wants to set the record straight.
He has tried before in Minnesota, 
used car dealerships in Arizona, 
subway cars in Manhattan. Now he tries 
through my parents' radio. Rain punches 
earth, the storm washes him away.
What is left, indecipherable noise, 
startles my mother. Soon Elvis is unplugged 
but his speech continues. Maybe it's Elvis 
trying to talk to us my father quips.
If only we knew.
I wake up the next morning to a phone call.
It is Elvjs. The phone line chokes up his voice. 
I can barely hear you he manages. I want 
to say the same thing. I hang up.
Dave Elman

Self-reflection
Sharmila Venkatasubban
I saw my face
in water, a clear
path leading back
to the slow rising glow
of the moon. But I was barely
conscious of what I saw.
I saw my brother 
a burst of blood that bloomed 
from my broken skin.
My face draining pale 
in the image.

---------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------

Child Playing the Suicide Game
Travel the narrow border.
Tiptoe from intricate scroll to lotus 
blossom. You cannot step in open 
blue spaces; you will drown.
No way to reach the dragons 
mouth without leaping.
Now turn
slowly. Explore the spear-like Chinese 
characters on knees and elbows. 
Breathe hard. Youve reached 
the enemy line.
Walk barefoot to the edge 
where carpet fringe meets floor 
like an ice-flow sliding into water. 
Careful not to fall.
Karen Rigby

---------------------------------------------------

Excited State
It's the best place to bathe in lightning 
the lead room in the storm, grounded to earth. 
Observation from the windows 
center the crosshairs on the umbrellas 
God may need a targeting system.
The pedestrians wait to be lanced 
record connection and conduction 
then to the phone, the paramedics.
Out into the street, grab the fallens' wrists
feel the steadying post
reveal the omnipotent amazement
what are the odds? Who could have thought?
Donovan Chase

The road to paradise, the path to dreams,
Was paved for drunk dancers to merengue.
Into the club they strut in borrowed shoes 
To charleston for hours of borrowed time.
They pass away at their nine to fives,
And lie waiting in their cubicle mortuaries 
For evening beats and midnight rhythms 
To resuscitate their sleeping hearts.
Out of hospital gown neckties or heels 
And into less constricting leather pants.
Refugees from flourescent office lights 
Make their pilgrimage to pay homage to a disco ball 
And when they're two turns away from living, 
Policemen pallbearers kill the music.
It's time to go, they say. It's after hours.
But the survivors don't leave easily.
As they flee the scene.
They blow cigarette smoke at the police,
Up their noses like sweet chocolate.

Tranquilizer Shot
I imagine myself descending 
a mollusk-shaped staircase 
balancing a tin lantern 
light punctuates my breath 
primitive star throbbing 
over black miles 
my body a bucket 
lowered by sleep's 
rope and pulley
Karen Rigby

March 27, on going to Bridgeport
I catch myself sitting in the chair tonight 
legs tangled beneath me 
It is hot outside
My chin rests on my hand, I find 
the air thick with past cold.
There was nothing for dinner that night
I walked alone for a bowl of noodles,
like it was that obvious
that I should want noodles now,
after waking at 7
in a hollow, ghost-washed state
I queued like everyone else, they were
about to close, so I dropped my tip
on the table and went home
to pack
I left the next morning, joyful.
Now the water in the bathroom  
it's running, must've left it on 
I turn the light on 
stare at the empty sink.
I have no sympathy for me.
Anne Ray

The coffee in the kitchen is percolating 
like rain off our roofs gutter.
Cats glare through the window, perched 
on die white plastic furniture we bought 
for evenings of married neighbors, wine, 
hushed laughs.
I would fry you an omelet 
but I know youre not hungry.
Youll leave in minutes for the bus 
and it will be my turn for the shower, 
after I rinse out the mugs.
More and more this is what I wait for: 
the crescending slaps of caffeine, 
night turning to dawn, this silence 
weve earned.
You tie your hair back, pencil 
in your eyebrows, powder your chin 
ami wrap a scarf around your neck.
