Man killed near 
O in Oakland
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
' A shooting early Sunday morning near The Original Hot Dog 
Shop on Forbes Avenue left one man dead and witnesses badly 
shaken.
Andre Byrd, 18, of Oakland, was mortally wounded and died at 
Presbyterian-University Hospital later that night. No further 
information was available from the hospitals news bureau.
Details were sketchy at press time. Byrd was apparently shot 
through the arm, heart, and lung with an automatic pistol as he 
stood across the street from the McDonalds on Forbes.
According to an eyewitness who asked not to be identified, at 
approximately 2:05 am, he and a friend were standing near the 
comer of Forbes and Oakland Avenues. The witness, a CMU staff 
5 member, saw a man standing on the south side of Forbes in the 
3700 block, fire an undetermined number of shots at Byrd, on the 
opposite side.
There was a ton of people out, said the staffer. Some guy on 
the other side of the street pulled out a gun. We heard the shots, 
but we thought it was a cap gun.
Ronald Freeman, commander of the citys investigations branch, 
said that the his department has reason to believe the incident was 
gang related.

Music professor 
dies of cancer
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Charlotte Black, assistant 
professor of music, died of can
cer on September 11 at her 
home in Scott Township. Black 
was 40 years old.
A1975 graduate of Chatham 
College, Black received her 
master of fine arts degree from 
CMU in 1977 and joined the 
faculty in 1984. She was an 
accomplished performer who 
enjoyed a successful career, 
said Marilyn Thomas, head of 
the Music Department.
She was a wonderful lyric 
coloratura soprano. She sang 
opera and musical theater, and 
performed with orchestras 
around the country, Thomas 
said. She was a wonderful role 
model for the students, not just 
because of her career, but be
cause she was a wonderful hu
man being.
She was a quiet organizer, 
able to fix up our schedules, 
said Beatrice Krebs, professor 
emerita of music and a long
time friend and mentor ofBlack. 
'You could always count on her. 
And she was terrific with the 
kids.
She taught approximately 
twenty students a year. She 
has worked with literally hun
dreds of young singers, many of 
whom are on Broadway right 
now, Thomas said.
We had students who came 
to her funeral from as far away 
asNewYorkCity and Germ any. 
Its safe to say that the Music 
Department is mourning her
loss.
Thomas called Blacks fight 
with cancer incredibly coura
geous. She was an extraordi
nary person, Thomas said. 
She would be very uncomfort
able with us wallowing in sad
ness. She was quite a lady. 
[This spring] in order to keep 
her students on schedule she 
would have her mother bring 
her here straight from chemo
therapy, said Krebs. This is 
what kept her going. She was 
totally devoted to her students. 
I believe the last conversa
tion I had with Charlotte was 
in early August when she was 
confined to bed, Thomas said. 
It was a call to me made out of 
concern that one of her stu
dents might not be able to get 
into one of the programs she 
had auditioned for.
I hope her students really 
appreciated the fact that she 
went way beyond what she had 
to do just for them, saidKrebs. 
She wanted to return to teach
ing this fall, but we knew that 
wouldnt be possible. I think 
thats what kept her going. 
Black was a past president of 
the National Association of 
Teachers of Singing, and a so
loist and cantor for the Assump
tion Church in Bellevue for 
seven years. She is survived by 
her parents, Perry and 
Constance Black of Scott Town
ship, and a brother, Bernard, 
ofCrafton. The family has sug
gested that memorial contri
butions be made to the Ameri
can Cancer Society, 241 Fourth 
Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15219.
Senate condemns Hunt hoursSenate urges change; second sit-in staged Thursday
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan News Editor
Student activity has yet to cease concern
ing the hours of Hunt Library. At Tuesdays 
Student Senate meeting, Senate passed pro
posal F93-1 titled, Resolution Concerning 
Curtailment of Hunt Library Hours, by a 
vote of 13-3-1.
Then, Thursday night, the second library 
sit-in was staged on the third floor of Hunt 
Library until 3 am.
University Libraries had originally reduced 
the hours of Hunt Library from Sunday to 
Thursday such that it closed at midnight 
instead of 3 am. Due to the student response, 
Charles Lowry, University librarian, ex
tended the hours of the 
library to 3 am for only the 
ground and first floors 
[Extended but limited 
hours starts Hunt sit-in,
9/13].
The resolution, pro
posed by Student Senate 
Vice-Chair Gregory 
Haverkamp, condemns 
University Libraries for 
making the decision to 
shorten the librarys 
hours, urges a return to 
the old hours, and de
mands that University 
Libraries make a better, 
more concerted effort to 
see that a representative 
number of students are 
included in any decision 
making process....
In a debate during 
the Senate meeting,
Haverkamp said, Theres 
little question that people 
have been unhappy.... Its 
high time that Senate do 
something about it, or at 
least have a voice about' 
it. Haverkamp also ad
dressed the librarys failure to notify Student 
Senate of any major changes.
Tony DeRoss, chair of the Campus Affairs 
Committee, urged Senate to vote down the 
proposal and wait until tomorrows meeting. 
Accordingto DeRoss, his committee will meet 
with Lowry. Lowry has been listening, said 
DeRoss. Vote this down and wait until our 
questions are answered.
There was no reason to delay, said 
Haverkamp. Everybody knows they want to 
see the hours back to the way they were. 
Ignatios Alexander, head of administra
tive services for University libraries, agrees 
with DeRoss. Lowry is definitely interested 
in meeting with Student Senate for future 
discussions, said Alexander.
Haverkamp said, If [the proposal] 
didnt pass, it would be a big dent in 
showing how people feel about this
issue. Because it did, it makes it very clear 
that this is an important issue that has the 
students concern.
I think the resolution was a strong posi
tive step in the right direction, said Student 
Government President David Wolpert. It 
remains to be seen, however, whether the 
administration fully comprehends the mes
sage behind the resolution.
Although the proposal passed, Haverkamp 
still arranged a Hunt Library sit-in on Thurs
day night. About 53 students participated in 
the sit-in, which started at 11:45 pm on 
Thursday, and ended at 3 am without inci
dent, according to a crime and incident re
port.
At Thursdays sit-in, no administrative fig
ures were present.
There were more people, due to the publicPlease see PROTEST, page 3

notices that the 
second, third, and 
fourth floors of

Scotland Yard opens Thursday night
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan News Editor
Dining Services announced 
that Scotland Yard will reopen 
for the fall semester on Thurs
day, September 23, at 7 pm  
one day later than originally 
planned. According to Roger 
Heydt, director of Dining Ser
vices, Scotland Yard will have 
the same menu, the same hours, 
and the same atmosphere, with 
only minor changes.
It was originally announced in 
signs around campus that Scot
land Yard would open this 
Wednesday, September 22, but 
Heydt said, [Dining Services] 
decided to leave enough time for 
employee training.... We want to 
open strong.
Heydt also said that unfore
seen equipment repairs needed 
to be made.
According to Heydt, employee 
training is being held Monday 
and Tuesday, and that opening
on Wednesday was too short of 
time for new employees.
Some of the minor changes in 
Scotland Yard will be the accep
tance of DineXpress and the end 
of delivery service. Those who 
use DineXpress cannot use it for 
tips, however. Scotland Yard will 
continue to accept CampusXpress
worked there last year, that was 
a service which was not widely 
used, and had significant cost 
implications.
For the first time, Dining Ser
vices will have a major role in the 
management of Scotland Yard. 
According to Heydt, Dining Ser
vices role is assisting Scotland
We were bent in our position to get 
Scotland Yard open in the quickest 
amount of time ... [and] we will con
tinue to do so.

because of student recommenda
tions, according to Heydt.

ministrative support.
We were bent in our position 
to get Scotland Yard open in the

Scotland Yard will have a stu
dent oversight committee, eight 
student supervisors, and all stu
dent employees.
Allison Russo was hired by Din
ing Services as manager of Scot
land Yard. She defined her posi
tion as being able to advise stu
dents and to do everything pos
sible to run it properly.
I am in charge of staffing and 
training of supervisors and staff, 
said Russo.
Scotland Yard will remain open 
for the rest of the semester until 
Skibo is closed for the University 
Center construction.
Scotland Yard is opening for 
the semester under the recom
mendation of Michael Murphy, 
dean of Student Affairs [Dining

GSIAs Program for Executives ranked #1 by Wall Street Journal
By FRANK MICHELS
Tartan News Editor
In the Friday, September 10 issue of The Wall 
Street Journal, GSIAs Program for Executives 
(PFE) was ranked first in a survey taken by The 
Wall Street Journal and Brickers International 
Directory, a reference guide to executive programs.
The survey ranked the top non-degree, publicenrollment executive programs in the United States 
and Europe. The survey was sent to corporate 
officials who select and purchase executive educa
tion courses, accordingto The Wall Street Journal.
According to GSIAs informational booklet on 
PFE, the program is a four-week program for 
upper-level managers, designed to broaden their 
overall perspective and strengthen their skills in 
the art and science of general management.
Various objectives of the program include under
standing the political, social, and economical forces 
which impact the firm; strengthening analytical 
and decision-making skills; and becoming more
effective leaders.
The program attracts individuals from around 
the world, said Robert S. Sullivan, dean of GSIA. 
Sullivan said that some of the colleges most influ
ential alumni participated in PFE.
According to Peter Vantine, associate dean of 
GSIA and director of executive education, classes 
average 35 participants per session, with a core 
faculty drawn from GSIA professors, of which 
about 35 percent come from other leading institu
tions.
We have a specific target audience, said Vantine. 
We tend to accept those with technological expe
rience or those from technological companies. 
[PFE] was established in 1954  its the oldest 
program of its kind, Sullivan said. Its the flag
ship of executive programs.
Accordingto The Wall Street Journal, the surveys 
biggest surprise was that some of the best-known 
general management courses such as at Harvard, 
Columbia, and Northwestern, earned lower ratPlease see GSIA, page 3

Clintons health care 
plan could hurt jobs
WASHINGTON, September 17 
(DJ)  President Clinton acknowledgedyesterday that some small busi
nesses and individuals would pay 
more for health care under his plan. 
At a morning meeting with people 
who had written the White House 
about their problems paying for 
health care, he said that some young, 
healthy people may end up paying a 
bit more to guarantee that everyone 
else in a regional or state-run insur
ance pool could be covered.
And meeting later with 20 small 
business owners at a hardware store, 
he conceded that some jobs could be 
lost and some companies could be 
hurt by the plan. But he insisted 
that, overall, costs would be lower 
and fewer jobs would be lost under 
his plan than if the current system is 
maintained.
To use an old phrase, we dont 
want to make perfect the enemy of 
good, Clinton said.
The President indicated that he 
may give further consideration to the
problems of small companies withmore 
than 50 employees.
At the same time, Erskine Bowles, 
head of the Small Business Adminis
tration, said the agency will set up a 
toll-free number for small companies to 
call the agency for help comparing the 
administrations proposal with what 
they currently offer. He insisted that, 
under the plan, most small companies 
would have either lower costs or better 
coverage for their employees.
Clinton and Bowles both referred to a 
recent study by National Small Busi
ness United, the second-largest small 
business organization, which they said 
shows that many companies would pay 
less than $1 or $2 a day for health 
coverage under the new administra
tion proposal.
But later in the day, John Galles, 
NSBU vice president, disagreed with 
their analysis of the groups data.
We think the Presidents plan is 
entirely too complicated to reach that 
conclusion, he said. It would be a 
simplistic use of numbers.
Wofford encouraged by health plan proposal
WASHINGTON, September 17 
(AP)  Senator Harris Wofford (DPa.) hits a milestone this week when 
President Clinton formally intro
duces a sweeping national health 
proposal that would extend insur
ance coverage to all Americans while 
attempting to contain the spiraling 
cost of care.
It was nearly two years ago that
 the freshman Democrat, then 
Pennsylvanias secretary of labor and 
industry, won his seat in the Senate 
, after promising to push for an over
haul of the nations health-care sys
tem.
Wofford was elected to fill the un
expired term of the late Senator 
John Heinz of Pittsburgh.
Woffords own views on the issue 
have evolved significantly since his 
election, and during that time hes 
endorsed then abandoned various 
ideas for the best way to expand 
coverage, bring down costs, and main
tain quality services.
The plan Clinton will introduce 
Wednesday before a joint session of 
Congress doesnt replace Medicare, as 
Wofford once advocated.
And while Wofford has said the plan 
must not restrict a patients right to 
choose a doctor, its dear that Clintons 
approach to steer people into so-called 
managed care networks would limit 
that choice for many Americans.
Wofford says he was encouraged by 
the recent cooperative mood on 
Capitol Hill on health care, although 
he noted a congressional battle was 
ahead.
Republican leaders have their own 
plan but have signaled that they are 
ready to work with the administration.
But, as Congress prepares to begin 
work on the package, the question of 
how much political risk Wofford takes 
in the outcome is unclear.
He faces what is expected to be a 
tough re-election fight next year, and 
several Republicans are already lining 
up to challenge him.
Suspected ex- Nazi scheduled for release
JERUSALEM, September 19 (AP)  
A lawyer for John Demanjuk is not say
ing when the former Ohio auto worker 
will leave an Israeli prison or where he 
will go.
But lawyer Yoram Sheftel says todays 
ruling by an Israeli Supreme Court jus
tice marks an end to the lengthy appeals 
against Demanjuks release. The justice 
lifted a restraining order delaying 
Demjanjuks deportation, clearing the 
way for him to leave Israel. The high 
court earlier had reversed a verdict that 
Demanjuk was the notorious Treblinka 
gas chamber operator Ivan the Ter
rible.
Todays ruling brought immediate pro
test. Holocaust survivors andNazi-hunters want him tried again on other 
charges. An official of one Nazi-hunters 
group calls this a sad day for Israeli 
justice and for Jews.Senate battle expected over new crime bill
WASHINGTON, September 19 (AP)
 With the attention of international 
tourists focused on violent crime in this 
country, the Senate this week is ex
pected to consider a crime bill.
The best-known section of the crime 
bill is known as the Brady Bill, which 
would require a minimum waiting pe
riod for handgun purchases. Sources say 
Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph 
Biden is moving to separate that section 
so it can be considered alone.
The Brady Bill has support from Presi
dent Clinton and many on Capitol Hill. 
But New York Republican Senator 
Alfonse DAmato says he doesnt want to 
put up more barriers for law-abiding 
people who want to defend themselves. 
Instead, he says hell offer a measure to 
mandate tougher punishment for crimes 
committed with guns.Joint Chiefs nominee hearing slated this week
WASHINGTON, September 19 (AP)
 The supposed sins of the father are 
expected to haunt the son this week as a 
congressional committee considers Presi
dent Clintons choice to lead the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff.
General John Shalikashvili is highly 
respected. But as he comes up for confir
mation hearings, some senators have 
questions about the generals family 
questions supplied by the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center, which investigates 
former Nazis.
Shalikashvilis father, Dmitri, was a 
World War II officer in Germanys Waffen 
SS. The SS was Hitlers elite unit, but 
there is no public evidence that the 
generals father was involved in antiJewish or death-camp activities.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin predicts 
the revelations will have no bearing on 
the nomination.Federal agents lost track of Waco cultists
WACO, TEXAS, September 19 (AP) 
A published report says the federal 
governments ill-fated raid on David 
Koreshs cult compound near Waco, 
Texas failed in part because agents lost 
track of men there who could take up 
arms.
Todays Waco Tribune-Herald reports 
that a former commander of an elite 
Army unit says the problems were known 
days before the February 28 assault.
Retired Colonel Rod Paschall says the 
raid was based on the notion of the men 
being at a work site outside the com
pound, away from the room where weap
ons were kept.
Paschall says the view of the work site 
was obscured by a plastic covering a few 
days before the raid, but the plans for 
the raid werent changed.
The early-morning raid left four fed
eral agents and a half-dozen cultists 
dead. It triggered a 51-day standoff.China advised not to resume nuclear testing
WASHINGTON, September 17 (DJ) 
On Friday, President Bill Clinton urged 
China to drop reported plans to resume 
nuclear testing and concentrate instead 
on economic strength.
China has nothing to fear from any of 
the worlds other nuclear weapons pow
ers, he said.
Im very hopeful that the Chinese will 
not do that, Clinton told a news confer
ence after U.S. officials suggested that 
China is preparing to detonate a nuclear 
weapon at its remote testing site in 
Xinjiang province.
Within the last several weeks, the 
United States grew increasingly con
cerned about the status of the Chinese 
testing program, said State Department 
spokesman Michael McCurry.
As a result of these concerns, McCurry 
said, the U.S. had urged China several 
times not to carry through its plans and 
also asked other countries to make the 
same plea.
NAFTA trade pact raises questions
WASHINGTON, September 16 (DJ)
 House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt raised a number of specific 
concerns about the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, although he stopped 
short of suggesting that he will attempt 
to kill the trade pact.
Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told 
a Hispanic business group that he par
ticularly has strong reservations about 
environmental and labor side agree
ments reached last month with the Mexi
can and Canadian governments.
Standing alone I will not support [the 
side agreements], he told a forum spon
sored by Hispanic Business Magazine.
Gephardt declined to elaborate to re
porters after exiting the luncheon fo
rum. Earlier, a spokesman for his office 
said the congressman would be making 
a major address on NAFTA sometime 
next week and that his comments at the 
Hispanic conference were not designed 
to be the major policy signal anticipated 
from the senior House member.
During his luncheon address, 
Gephardt pointed to a number of areas 
where he has concerns about NAFTA 
Those concerns primarily focused around 
funding worker retraining and border 
environmental cleanup.
Gephardt has raised these issues in 
the past, leading to speculation that he 
will be a strong opponent of the trade 
agreement designed to cut tariffs be
tween the three nations over a 15-year 
period.
Gephardt, in his luncheon address, 
said that he also has concerns about 
wage differentials between the U.S. and 
Mexico which potentially could lower 
the standard of living among U.S. work
ers.
At the same time, Gephardt appeared 
to be leaving the door open to some 
compromise over NAFTA, saying that 
we will have to find answers to the 
problems.
The Clinton Administration and Con
gress are currently in consultation over 
cobbling together implementing legisla
tion for NAFTA. Administration offi
cials hope the process will be completed 
by November 1, in time for Congress to 
vote on the trade agreement for imple
mentation by a January 1 target.

lever was bent.
9/16 MEDICAL ESCORT,
12:46 am. A student said that 
approximately two or three hours 
after eating at the Highlander 
Cafe, he began to experience se
vere stomach cramps and felt he 
had food poisoning.
Student EMS was summoned 
and responded to the victims 
room. EMS advised the student 
to seek medical treatment. He 
was transported to Presbyterian 
Hospital.
9/16 TERRORISTIC 
THREATS, 8:36 am. A staff 
member said that on September 
15, she received a call from a 
former employee who was termi
nated. The caller called her a pig, 
at which time she hung up the 
phone. The staff member is con
cerned because the former em
ployee was known for carrying 
firearms and has previously 
threatened to kill her and every
one else in the office.

SHOOTING, from page 1
There were two factions in
volved. The shooter was dressed 
in red and the victim was dressed 
in blue, which suggests the Crips 
and Bloods were involved, said 
Freeman. There were about four 
people on each side. Words were 
exchanged, and shots were fired. 
The suspects fled the scene in a 
car. Freeman refused to release
a description of the suspect or theT;

The witness said that the events 
took place so quickly we just 
couldnt believe it was happen

F93-1 Resolution Concern
ing Curtailment of Hunt Li
brary Hours:
Whereas, the students of the

hours of Hunt Library; and
Whereas, students have dem
onstrated their opposition to the 
new hours and their desire for 
the old hours of Hunt Library 
through a petition and a Hunt 
Library sit-in; and
Whereas, the process used in 
making the decision demon
strates a lack of concern for the 
students of the University in a 
way that simply cannot be toler
ated; therefore,
Be it resolved, that Student 
Senate condemns University Li
braries formaking a decision with 
such little regard for the impact 
upon the students of the Univer
sity; and
Be it further resolved, that Stu
dent Senate strongly urges Uni
versity Libraries to return the 
hours of Hunt Library to its pre
vious hours, for all floors, closing 
from Sunday through Thursday; 
at 3:00 am; and finally,
Be it further resolved, that Stu-! 
dent Senate demands that in the 
future, University Libraries make 
a better, more concerted effort to 
see that a representative number 
of students are included in any 
decision making process concern
ing issues of such magnitude.
Points of Discussion:
Issues discussed were the de
bate process, library issue, writ-; 
ing a resolution properly and ap
propriate wording, and sending'  
issues through committee.
Announcements:

FORUM
Administration must 
listen to protestors
For the second week in a row, 
students have gathered in 
Hunt Library to protest the 
shorter hours that were an
nounced at the beginning of 
the semester by University Li
brarian Charles Lowry.
Though Lowry and the ad
ministration attempted to 
stave off the first protest by 
extending hours on the first 
floor and basement of Hunt 
until 3 am, this did not fully 
address the complaints of the 
protestors. Restricting latenight use to the basement and 
first floor of Hunt still prevents 
students from using vital li
brary services, such as the pe
riodical collection and the cir
culation desk.
However, with the continu
ing sit-ins on Hunts third floor, 
and increasing numbers of stu
dents attending (54 attendees 
this week, as opposed to 35 last 
week) its possible that the ad
ministration and, in particu
lar, Lowry, will see our point of 
view on the issue. Hunt Li
brary, and all its services, must 
return to its former hours of 
operation.
Though we remain disheart
ened with the Universitys 
seeming unwillingness to co
operate on this issue, were impressed with the students who 
have made it their business to 
protest. Students have actually 
shown up (unusual for our unmo
tivated student body), and we fully 
expect them to keep showing up, 
in greater and greater numbers. 
Not only have the students been 
coming together, but they have 
been the very model of proper civil 
disobedience  well-behaved, 
non-violent protestors. Kudos go 
especially to those involved from 
Student Government. They are 
taking their leadership roles more 
seriously than ever, and, as a re
sult, are doing a fine j ob. Members 
of Student Senate this week 
passed a resolution calling for the 
reversal of the new Hunt Library 
hours.
Judging from this veritable out
pouring of support from the stu
dent body, it appears to us that 
there are grounds for the Univer
sity and the University Librarian 
to reopen discussion with student 
leaders, starting with Senate. 
Lowry has assured members of 
the Senate Campus Affairs Com
mittee that he would meet with 
them to discuss the issue.
He must do so, and he must be 
willing to accept their point of 
view.
Hunt Library must return to its 
old hours, and soon.
Can CMDS manage 
Scotland Yard?
This Wednesday, the much
loved Scotland Yard will be re
opening. Good news, you think? 
Hold that thought. This time 
its under new management  
Carnegie Mellon Dining Ser
vice (CMDS). While the pros
pect of once again having late 
night mochas and triple choco
late death cake does make us 
happy, we are concerned about 
what the new CMDS manage
ment might do to change it. In 
the past, Dining Service hasnt 
exactly had the Midas touch. 
We hope that the Yards his
torical past and the seemingly 
honest efforts CMDS is mak
ing to preserve the original 
spirit of the Yard will not make 
this venture one to regret.
Nonetheless, the reopening 
of the Yard is a good thing. 
Many of us know and love the 
Yard, so theres a chance that 
it will succeed under CMDS. 
Besides, with so many eating 
establishments on campus clos
ing down or reducing hours, an 
open Yard is a much welcomed 
prospect.
CMDS has made, at least 
ostensibly, quite an effort to 
ensure that the Yards unique 
personality wont be lost, down 
to offering people who used to 
work there jobs again, and allowingpeople from the old Yard 
to supervise the takeover. Since 
they have also made a pledge 
not to change the menu, this 
may not end up a disaster.
Even though were enthusi
astic aboutthe reopening, were 
aware that no one can guaran
tee succes. One problem is that, 
in general, CMDS food quality 
and service is not that great. 
Even with all the supervision 
and promises they have made, 
we wonder if Dining Service 
may just have a curse that is 
impossible to avoid. We hope
Letters to the Editor
Opinion piece unfair, wrong
Pl
Letter to 
the Editor
this will not be the case, and are 
willing to give the Dining Service 
management a chance. However, 
it would be a great shame to see a 
fun eating place like the Yard fail 
under any circumstances.
Another problem that could 
happen is the shortening of hours. 
When the Yard was open before, it 
was the only place on campus stu
dents could go to satisfy their late 
night munchies and get a snack or 
a cup of coffee after midnight. If 
the Yard were forced to close early 
like the rest of Dining Services 
facilities, it would lose most of its 
appeal and purpose. The times 
when the Yard was most crowded 
were usually late at night, and it 
would be a poor move for CMDS to 
shorten the hours.
A final concern of ours is the 
source of food the Yard will be 
using. Under CMDS management, 
we are worried the Yard might 
not be able to get food from nonMarriot vendors. We might not be 
able to get all those wonderful 
desserts that the Yard used to get 
from local vendors  and that 
would be bad. Dining Service 
should know that the availability 
of those non-Marriot foods was 
one of the Yards main draws.
Any attempt at reopening the 
Yard is a good thing. Even when 
the service was bad and the Yard 
ran out of everything but pita 
bread, people still went there. The 
Yard had a comfortable atmo
sphere and was one of the very 
few places where students could 
just go and hang out. For nearly 
ten years, its been one of the few 
traditions that we could count on 
being around for the future.
Lets hope that, under Dining 
Services, the Yard can continue 
that tradition. And lets also hope 
that, once the new university cen
ter is built, well see the return of 
a new, better, student-run Scot
land Yard.
Editor:
Last year anumber of offensive ar
ticles about Israel 
appeared in The 
Tartan. On a few 
of these occasions letters to the editor or to 
the authors of the columns were written in 
response. Sometimes we just ignored the 
columns as best we could.
Anotheryearis upon us andiflast weeks 
Tartan [PLO, Israel peace is doubtful, 9/ 
13] is any indication, it looks like we have 
our work cut out for us . Yes, everyone is 
entitled to their opinions about Israel. We 
have several opinions among us and have 
disagreed with a number of Israels poli
cies in the past. But when someone por
trays Israel as the all evil fascist empire 
(our words) whose actions against the Pal
estinians (are) no different from what 
Hitler did to the Jews, Gypsies and other 
undesirablesthe columnists words 
and describes Israel as a modem day 
Nazi Germany, we get very disturbed. We 
would refer the columnist to various texts 
on the history of the Holocaust in the 
Carnegie Mellon library and recommend a 
visit to the Holocaust Museum in Wash
ington, D.C. After some exploration, it 
becomes clear that such a parallel is incon
ceivable, disturbing, and offensive.
Particularly now, when peace is being 
worked out between the parties directly, 
articles misrepresenting the situation are 
counterproductive. They do not encourage 
dialogue and they do not promote under
standing. In general, these types of ar
ticles confuse opinion with fact, omit facts, 
and blur facts to support their points.
We are not saying that Israel is never at 
fault and that reporting in the media is not 
based on fact.
But when one examines any issue, par
ticularly a controversial one such as the 
situation in the Middle East, one must 
examine the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth. Facts quoted out of 
context are often worse than lies.
The positive moves we are seeing now in 
the Middle East are hopefully just the first 
steps down what will likely be a long and 
difficult road.
Obviously, many obstacles still need to 
be overcome. Some we see now and others 
we will only discover later. Discounting 
these first steps because they do not solve 
the whole issue only leaves one with the 
status quo. We, at least, are not happy 
there.

During Rosh 
Hashanah, the Jew
ish new year, we re
cite the phrase 
Hayom harat 
olam, Today the 
world was created. At this time of re
newal for the Jewish people, we are proud 
of the risks that Israel has taken in enter
ing the peace process with the PLO. This 
truly is a time of creation, of rebirth.
We would like to share the other side of 
a long and sad story. Unfortunately, Mahua 
Dutta [PLO, Israel peace is doubtful, 9/13] 
failed to accurately portray Israel, espe
cially the armys policies and the politics of 
peace.
Since ancient times, Israel has been 
central to Judaism as a homeland. In re
cent times, the Israelis have struggled 
underthereignofterrorthatYassar Arafat 
and Arab leaders have persistently pur
sued.
While Mahua Dutta faults Israel for not 
recognizing the PLO, s he failed to men
tion that until last week, the PLO did not 
recognize Israel.
Would it make sense to attempt negotia
tions with a group whose previous goal 
was to annihilate you? Under those condi
tions, there is not much room for discus
sion. There are a range of opinions among 
Jews concerning the prospects for peace in 
the Middle East. We join members of the 
campus community who watched Yassar 
Arafat shake hands with Rabin and we 
hope for a speedy and easy remedy to the 
tensions that have drained so many re
sources from the lives and cultures of the 
Palestinians and the Jews living in the 
Middle East.

Pl
Letter to

Editor:
In 1948 the Brit
ish Mandate of Pal
estine ended and 
the land was di
vided into two 
states; Israel and Palestine. This act gave 
independence to both the Jewish and the 
Palestinian people.
As soon as independence was declared, 
Israel was invaded. Israel managed to 
hold its ground, but Palestine did not. The 
Jordanians did not give freedom to the 
Palestinians.
They were placed in refugee camps and 
treated very poorly.
Later on, Israel took over in the 
West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan 
Heights. Israel gave the Palestininas 
freedom to build homes, roads, vil
lages, and whatever they needed to 
five.
The editorial that appeared [PLO, 
Israel peace is doubtful, 9/13] about 
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process 
is very upsetting and misleading.
Israel has always recognized the Pal
estinians as a people and a culture. 
The recognition that came about in 
the peace process was that for the 
PLO, an organization that represents 
a faction of the Palestinians.
The Palestinians are made up of 
many factions.
There has never been agreement 
between them about what would be 
acceptable terms for peace with Is
rael. Now the PLO has made an agree
ment, but some factions will not be 
satisfied as long as Israel exists.
Everyone should be aware of the 
security problems faced by Israel. 
There is always the threat of an attack 
by a neighboring nation. In addition, 
there are terrorists in and around Is
rael who are a threat to the military 
and innocent citizens and tourists as 
well.
I agree that the majority of Arabs 
are not terrorists, but it must be ac
knowledged that some Arabs are ter
rorists.
Israel has had to protect itself from ' 
terrorism thoughoutits existence. The 
comparison of terrorists to resistance 
movements during World War II is 
inaccurate because they had very dif
ferent targets and reasons behind their 
actions.
The resistance was fighting to save 
their lives and the lives of others. 
Terrorists would not be so feared if 
their acts were that noble.
To continue with the World War II 
analogies, I am appalled that anyone 
could compare Israel to Nazi Germany. 
The Nazis had the goal of purging the 
world of an undesirable people.
Millions of innocent people were 
murdered. Israel does not attack with
out provocation, and even then they 
act in defense. Israel has no wish to 
harm, let alone eliminate, the Pales
tinians.
I am also upset by the unsubstanti
ated accusations of torture. I lived in 
Israel for some time and I have always 
kept up with the news. I have never 
heard such claims made. I do not think 
Jews would subject anyone to such 
things after experiencing torture at 
the hands of the Nazis just 50 years 
ago.
Israel does not want to repress the 
human rights of the Palestinians. The 
current peace process is giving them 
more rights and more freedom. It has 
taken many years for the Palestinians 
to become united enough to make such 
improvements.Remember that it only 
takeB one party to create war and 
unrest. It takes every party, working 
together to create peace.

Comparing Israel to Nazis is blatantly offensive
Etan Diamond
In reference to last weeks col umn [PLO, Israel peace is doubtful, 9/13], Id like to offer a 
counter point. I hope that the 
Israelis and Palestinians will 
come to a peaceful resolution of 
their conflict.
First, the column claimed that 
' f to ensure peace, Israel will have 
I to continue making such policy 
M changes. Well, look at what the 
two sides have agreed to in this 
| peace negotiation.
N' On one hand, Israel gives land 
to the Palestiniansland which 
Israel rightfully won in 1967 in 
a war of self-defense against 
Arab aggression. In return, the 
Palestinians give up nothing. No 
land, no money, just a few vague 
promises about Israels right to 
exist. For extremists, however, 
such something-for-nothing ex' changes are not enough. Only 
. when Israel capitulates to the 
demands of terrorists and selfdestructs will they be happy. Well, 
keep waiting.
After all, the Palestinians need 
this treaty far more than the Is
raelis. Remember, Israel has a 
state, has had the support of the 
United States, and has a 
flourishing economy. And 
unlike her Arab and Pal
estinian neighbors  Is
rael has not conducted a 
series of wars on its neigh
bors for the past forty-five 
years.
So, perhaps last weeks 
column has it backwards.
The Palestinians, more 
than the Israelis, will have 
to make policy changes for this 
peace to endure. Arafat must com
pletely reject terrorism and the 
terrorist acts of Hamas and the 
Hezbollah, and have all people 
reject terrorism and accept mod
em, acceptable forms of diplo
macy.
Second, last weeks columnist 
offered a series of supposedly 
documented reports of Israeli 
torture of Palestinians. It ignores 
the countless bus bombings, 
rocket attacks, and ambushes
that PLO terrorists have per
formed on Israeli civilians over 
the past decades.
Remember the massacre of 11 
Israeli athletes at the 1972 
Munich Olympics?
Remember the massacre of 11 
Israeli athletes at the 1972 
Munich Olympics? Remember 
the 1976 hijacking of an Air 
France flight from Tel Aviv...?
It ignores the series of airplane 
hijackings and murders of citi
zens of other countries. Remem
ber the 1976 hijacking of an Air 
France flight from Tel Aviv to 
Paris, or the murder of Ameri
cans aboard the Achille Lauro 
cruise? Those victims had noth
ing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The column also ignores the 
widespread Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence, where even a 
hint of reconciliation with the Is
raelis brings a bullet to the head.
Why is the fact ignored that in 
Israel, opponents to the peace 
process conduct civil disobedience 
and formal protests, while in Gaza 
and elsewhere, opponents express

Who seems 
to be more 
peaceful? 
Take a hard 
look.
Finally, I 
turn to the 
 incredibly of
fensive analogy between Israel 
and Nazi Germany. Comparing 
Israel to Germany and the Israe
lis to the Nazis completely mis
represents the facts.
In Nazi Germany, the Jews 
were innocent victims. They were 
not opponents of the state, nor 
did they desire to destroy Ger
many. They were innocent vic
tims of a systematic genocide. In 
total contrast, the Palestinians 
have long declared that their goal 
is to eliminate Israel. And they
have taken violent measures to 
achieve that goal. In this context, 
any retaliation by Israel is com
pletely justified.
Obviously, any death of civil
ians is deplorable  on either 
side. But to equate the experi
ences of European Jewry and of 
the Palestinians turns my stom
ach and should sicken any knowl
edgeable human being.
In conclusion, I hope that the 
new recognition between Israel 
and the Palestinians leads to a 
more peaceful Middle East. Yet 
the continued propagation of lies 
tempers my optimism.
Extremism  on either side  
cannot yield any positive results; 
the unfortunate status quo of the 
past few decades proves that.
I hope that in the coming 
months, we will see more confi
dence building measures  such 
as the report of Palestinian chil

soldiers  and far, far less of the 
reactionary, misguided rantings

Before I started school here, I was told 
that the students at Carnegie Mellon were 
an apathetic bunch, concerned only with 
getting ahead, protecting their interests, 
and furthering their American Dream. 
But this slanderous stereotype has been 
squashed.
> The students of Carnegie Mellon saw an 
injustice, mobilized all their fury and out
rage, and set the world right again. All 
. this, as pointed out on this page last week,
without a hint of liberalism.

watch in awe 
the well-oiled

CMU.
I find the library protest a striking state

concerns of Americans in general. At the 
library in Squirrel Hill, the walls are cov
ered with a remembrance of the Jewish 
Holocaust in Germany during World War 
II.

reconsider
PlEditor:
% I take a 
great dealof pride m Letter to 
the Editormg to the
column [Diversity Will Take Its 
. Toll, 9/13] written by Ronak 
1 Singhal. For the rest of my brief 
letter, I will refer to Ronak 
Singhal as Jamal. Please in
dulge me.
Jamal has problems with the 
i jfact that some (actually, very few) 
'organizations and institutions in 
this vast society called Amerika 
have taken a long-overdue sec
ond look at ethnic inequality and 
sexism. Jamals premise seems 
..to be that the mere presence of 
'historically discriminated people 
here on campus suggests some 
sort of conspiracy against those 
initiators of the discrimination.
Apparently, Jamal has ESP; for 
.. he can look at a student walking 
across the Cut and immediately 
ascertain that persons abilities 
and motivations. I suggest that 
Jamal is wrong.
Early on in his commentary, 
Jamal relates that CMUs prir inary objective is to provide people 
an education such that they will 
be productive in society later in 
life. I pose the question...What 
about Afrikan-Amerikans,
. Latinos, and women? Should we 
[ endeavor only to be productive in 
equatorial jungles, Mexican bar
rios, and kitchens, respectively? I 
think not, Jamal.
I am an Afrikan-Amerikan 
i man, and I will be productive 
plight here at your beloved CMU, 
thank you very much. I know 
Women and Latino students who 
will be productive here as well. 
They also thank you, Jamal.
I would like to pose yet another 
question at this point. What 
makes one student more quali
fied than another? More specifi
cally, what makes AfrikanAmerikans, Latinos, and women 
less qualified than other groups? 
Hopefully, Jamal does not feel 
that the aforementioned histori
cally discriminated people are 
somehow inherently less quali
fied.
Finally, I would like to address 
Jamals statementthatthose who 
are more qualified and subse
quently rejected are being pun
ished for being [themselves]. 
Punishedee is a peculiar word 
from my perspective. Brother 
Malcolm and the Reverend King 
were punished. The Inca people 
were punished. Students rejected 
for admission at CMU are not 
being punished. But, what do I 
know? I dont belong here any
way...
Oh... Jamal, you can have your 
name back now. I like the name 
Jamal, though. What if you were 
forced by a vicious tyrant to take 
another name for the rest of your 
life? Imagine what it would be 
like to have your identity stripped 
as you were being sold at the 
auction block. What would that 
do for your self-esteem? At some 
point, you would like for someone 
to come up with a plan to help 
your descendants.

As the professor-in-residence

that this program at least was

Ms. Bianchini.
I believe the students at Tours 
would agree.

disappointed when I heard that 
the administration had decided 
to terminate the program.
What a shame that students 
will no longer have the opportu
nity to benefit from such a worth
while program.
Theres no way around the fact, 
however, that student participa
tion in the program was too low 
and that the program was too 
expensive to maintain for so few 
students.
The Centre de Tours was one of 
the few study programs at CMU 
in which everyone could have 
taken part.
With all the emphasis that 
CMU places on diversity, this 
program was its finest effort at 
putting its money where its 
mouth is.
However, despite CMUs pride 
in its culturally rich student popu
lation, there, is a subtle irony 
about CMU students: while the 
population as a whole may be 
diverse, individual students are 
not.
We get so deeply involved in 
the one, two, or even three things 
that we do that we havent time 
nor energy, nor perhaps even in
terest, in others. There is nothing 
necessarily wrong with such spe
cialization, but we sometimes 
become so focused that we sacri

Part of the blame goes to the 
students.
We make free choices about how 
we live our lives, and too often we 
retreat to the things we know for 
fear of moving on to things unfa
miliar to us.
Part of the blame should be put 
on the competition and intense 
academic programs at CMU.
Preparing students to become 
engineers, musicians, business 
managers, and chemists is ter
rific, but theres much to be said 
about making students knowl
edgeable and ready to face the 
world.
Finally, part of the blame be

If animals cannot have rights, 
then we humans are out of luck.
More importantly, Ball did not 
state in his article that non-hu
man animals deserve the same 
rights as humans. No one would 
argue that a cow should have the 
right to drive or vote any more 
than a human infant should.
However, one does not have to 
define any specific right for an 
animal, human or non, infant or 
adult, to believe that a fellow 
sentient being deserves a basic 
respect. This respect includes not 
murdering for a hunk of flesh; 
anyone with the remotest sense 
of compassion should grant at 
least this to all beings who desire 
to live.

Society must ditch superstitions
David Hunt
As a grad student, I often get 
home  not unlike most CMU 
students  in the wee hours. 
Sometimes I turn on the TV to 
numb my brain before sleep. Late 
night TV is rife withinfo-mercials 
for psychic and astrology 1-900 
lines and other paranormal ser
vices. Often shown are testimo
nials by true believers. Using 
testimonials is a time-honored 
tradition when there is no other 
evidence to support a claim.
Any fool can make vague pre
dictions. Supermarket tabloids 
have annual predictions with an 
abysmal accuracy rate. Yet people 
believe because it is the few hits 
that are remembered. Cold read
ing psychics, who can walk up to 
a person and supposedly read all 
sorts of facts, are nothing more 
than observant con-artists who 
read body language reactions to 
the generic phrases they spout. 
They are believed because the 
target doesnt remember the in
accurate statements.
Many people claim to have psy
chic powers. However, the fact 
remains that what they do is ex
plainable by ordinary physical 
laws, the ability of an illusion
ist, or is statistically unverifiable. Uri Geller in particular has 
made fantastic claims, such as 
the one that he was asked by 
NASA to help free Galileos stuck 
antenna. When NASA was called 
to confirm this, the response was 
hysterical laughter. Fire walkers 
give expensive lectures about the 
necessary concentration, when all 
thats necessary is a little phys
ics!
How many have seen their horo
scope and said Wow! That fits 
me!? But How specific is it, and 
what is the hit to miss ratio? My 
own custom horoscope has some 
hits. But it often steered wide of 
the mark. Had I paid less atten
tion, I might be awestruck at the 
predictive abilities of astrology.
Do you think of other people 
during the day? What if they call 
just as you think of them? Most 
people would say that this must 
be evidence of telepathy, but the 
odds are such that a number of 
such events will occur all by them
selves during a lifetime. Psychics,
astrologers, dowsers, and other 
entrail readers have been tested 
and have failed with routine regu
larity, even failing tests they 
agreed were fair  and on na

Serving alcohol to minors at fraternity parties is breaking the law
D.B. Krepps
Well, this week marks the end of what is 
known as Dry Rush, the time period when the 
college fraternities are not to have alcohol in the 
public rooms of their houses.
I find it rather interesting that fraternities are 
being so open about this. The only possible 
reason is the fact ___________________________

Some of the methods were classy, while others 
were rather crude, to say the least. I distinctly

I also recall someone else (from Delta Upsilon, I

I can't help but wonder at the number of laws being broken at

age. In Pennsylvania, that means no alcohol. I think that is 
pretty simple, yet many new students choose to ignore it. The

still many

are willing to

The existence 
of a dry rush 
could make one 
draw the conclu
sion that the wet rush is an all right thing.
Fraternities are still breaking the law at even 
though they impose a certain time that the law 
must be followed,
It is absolutely insane for anyone to believe that 
it is above the law. Imagine a scenario where the
following conversation takes place:
COP: What are you doing with that television 
at three in the morning?
THIEF: I... I... I was taking it for... repairs! 
Yeah, thats it! I worked late, so I was going to 
Eds All Night Repair Shop.
COP: Then why are you climbing out of that 
window?
THIEF: Uhh... my doors stuck...
COP: Dont worry, I understand. You can 
steal that tonight. Just dont let it happen next 
week.
THIEF: What?!
COP: Right, no-steal week doesnt start until 
Sunday. Can I give you a hand?
I firmly believe that alcohol should not be 
served to those who are legally obliged to not 
drink.
More police action is necessary so as to dis
courage this harmful and dangerous practice, 
but primarily the problem could be lessened 
first by allowing no alcohol at all during the 
times when primarily underage students would 
be visiting the fraternities. If a fraternity were 
to be caught in violation (presence of intoxi
cated students could possibly be proof enough), 
legal action would be in order.

It is depressing that history shows that it

I am hopeful, if not overly optimistic, that 
recent events in these areas mark the begin

As a nation, we could use the billions of dollars

More importantly, as individuals, we could do 
everything from changing our everyday lives so 
we do not contribute to suffering to volunteering

In doing so, our fives would be enriched beyond

Senior foward Rachel Bourn hustles down the sideline during Wednesday's game against Allegheny
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ

|| The womens soccer team went 2-0 this week 
with victories over Allegheny College 3-2, and 
Washington University 2-0. The teams record 
\ now stands at 3-1 and 1-1 in the UAA. 
i The win over Allegeheny was a come from behind 
victory which could only help the Tartans coming 
into their match with Washington University.
Allegheny was a boost. We showed a lot of 
character. We were in a hole but were able to pull 
ourselves out of it. It gave us a lot of momentum, 
-said Coach Julie Shackford.
Saturdays win was the first UAA victory for the 
womens soccer program, and Shackford was 
pleased with the result. It feels great. Our first 
UAA win for the program. It is definitely a great 
win.
\ The Tartans seemed determined and driven right 
from the start against Washington University.
I think we dominated from the get go, said 
Shackford. We showed a lot of confidence and 
patience. We were very aggressive, putting pres
sure on them defensively. We showed a lot of 
'Persistence for the entire ninety minutes.
Unlike Wednesdays game against Allegheny,
when the Tartans had to battle back from a 2-1 
deficit, this match was controlled f>y Carnegie 
Mellon.
The Tartans had a number of scoring chances 
and finally capitalized with 10:40 remaining in the 
period when freshman Alyssa Newman scored on 
a close range shot. Another CMU shot hit the post 
just before the half.
The second half was again dominated by the 
Tartans who had one opportunity after another to 
increase the score.
Despite outplaying the Bears, CMU only had a 
one goal lead until junior Christina Isaly scored on 
a beautiful pass from freshman Mae Hogan.
Mae Hogan played a hell of a game. She crossed 
well and trapped well defensively, said Shackford. 
It was a team effort. I dont think anyone particu
larly stood out.
I asked Shackford if only winning by two goals 
over a team you dominated for ninety minutes was 
somewhat troubling.
Its always scary when you are only up two, she 
said. If they get that one, it gives them some 
momentum.
Well, it is a moot point because freshman goal
keeper Jill Weber didnt allow any goals, in gaining 
her second shutout of the season.

The mens soccer team improved their record to 
3-0 (2-0 UAA) with a 3-1 victory over Washington 
University of St. Louis.
The team came out like a bat out of hell control
ling the tempo and style of the game.There were no 
visible signs that the Tartans were intimidated by 
the NCAA Division III soccer poll which ranked 
Washington University sixth in the nation. The 
Bears were also the preseason favorite to win the 
UAA championship.
The Bears sure didnt play like a team which 
deserves to be so highly ranked. The Tartans 
exploited their poor play with two goals in the first 
half. The first was on a header by graduate student 
John Stivoric.The play was set up by a precise 
centering pass across the top of the key.
The second goal came only 16 seconds later. 
Senior Michael Brazinski roared straight though 
the Bears defense and hit a laser shot past the 
goalie, Tim Stewart.
When you get two quick goals, that dictates the 
way the rest of the game goes, said coach Nick 
Gaudioso.
The rest of the half was filled with strong defense 
from the Tartan backs. Stivoric headed out a high 
shot on goal, and freshman Suraj Naik played 
incredible defense. Whats amazing is this is only
his third college game. It looks like hes been 
playing in college for years.
The only blemish of the first half was an injury to 
junior Pat Lucignani.
The only thing Im really concerned about is my 
top player, Gaudioso said. Its too early to tell 
when hell be able to play again.
Lucignani was kicked just below the knee, and 
required a brace and crutches. The guy who kicked 
me said it wasnt intentional, and he apoligized, 
said Lucignani.
Gaudioso was faced with a difficult situation. 
The game changed quite a bit when Pat came out. 
Hes a very control type player. We will need him 
back. We gave some quality time to [junior] Mark 
Hale. He did what he was supposed to do so we 
were happy with him.
Hale was substituted in for Lucignani and did an 
admirable job at the midfield position.
Senior goalkeeper David Shapiro made a num
ber of saves, and led the team to a 2-0 halftime 
lead. Shapiro started with two shutouts in his first 
two games, and Gaudioso was singing the praises 
of his netminder.
He plays steady and keeps the ball out of the net. 
Hes got a lot of experience. I dont worry too much 
about the goalkeepers.
The Bears came out strong to start the second 
half but to no avail.

|The Tartans Continued their 
| winning ways on Saturday by 
defeating UAA rival Rochester
? Yellowjackets 31-27. The Tar
tans are now 3-0 overall and 2-0 
in UAA play. Rochester fell to 1- 
1 and 0-1 in the UAA. Last sea
son, Rochester handed Carnegie 
Mellon its first UAA loss since
- CMU entered the conference in 
1990 with a 16-10 defeat at 
besling Stadium.
:j The Tartans won with six sec
onds left in the game. Junior quar
terback Chris Dee marched the 
h Tartans 75 yards in 2:45. The 
Tartans won the game with a 
two-yard pass from Dee to sopho
more halfback Mike Mathias in 
the end zone.
1 It was a pick play and I tried to 
i get open in the end zone. Chris 
had a great look and found me 
open over the middle. It was the 
most important game I ever 
played in, Mathias said.
The Tartan offense amassed 
' 511 total yards and ran 78 plays. 
Most of the 511 yards came from 
the arm of Dee. He threw for 379 
passing yards and completed 21 
of 34 passes, with one intercep
tion. The passing yardage and 
^completions set a CMU and UAA 
| record.
| This game was redemption for 
us. The team showed character 
and we didnt let ourselves get 
down. It was a group effort and 
^ its what were all playing for, 
Dee said.
The victory was a team effort. 
Dee spread his passing attack 
over six receivers. His favorite 
>. targets were sophomore tight end
 Aaron Neal and senior wide re
ceiver Jarrod Siket. Neal caught 
six passes for 141 yards. Two of 
Neals receptions came in the fi
nal drive of the game. Siket 
caught five passes for 138 yards, 
including a 27-yard touchdown 
reception in the second quarter. 
The Tartans also gained 151 
yards on the ground, mainly on 
the backs of senior fullback Brian 
Horton and junior halfback Ja
son Grusky.
Another key to the Tartans viccourtesy of CMU Athletics Dept. 
Junior CMU quarterback Chris Dee
tory was the defensive contain
ment of Rochesters UAA Offen
sive Players of the Year, senior 
running back Isaac Collins and 
senior tailback Jeremy Hurd. 
Collins and Hurd rushed for a 
combined 2,022 yards last sea
son. Hurd averaged 134.4 rush
ing yards a game, while Collins 
averaged 115.6 yards per game. 
The Tartan defense held both 
running backs to under 100 yards 
rushing.
How can you simulate Collins 
and Hurd? asked Head Coach 
Rich Lackner. You dont stop 
Collins and Hurd, you contain 
them. A key was that we did not
allow them to break for the long, 
run. There was no 45- or 60-yard 
jaunt.
We played an eight man front. 
At the end of the first half we 
played a more aggressive defen
sive line. We worked to penetrate 
with the line right away which 
forced the running back to cut 
earlier. This gave the lineback
ers more time to get to the ball, 
said Defensive Coordinator Terry 
Bodnar.
The Yellowjackets scored touch
downs on their first three posses
sions. The Tartans kept the game 
close in the first quarter on their 
second drive. They took the ball 
43 yards in six plays to set up a
Sophomore halfback Mike Mathias
42- yard field goal by senior place 
kicker Fred Harding.
Rochester pounded the ball 
through the middle to set up a 
two-yard touchdown run. 
Carnegie Mellon answered the 
touchdown with another Harding 
field goal. The field goal was a 35- 
yard attempt and made the score 
14-6 in favor of Rochester.
Rochester answered the field 
goal in one play. Yellowjacket
senior quarterback Gregg 
Eisenberg completed a 49-yard 
touchdown pass. The extra point 
attempt was blocked by Tartan 
senior inside linebacker Chad 
Wilson. Rochester seemed to be 
running away with the game as 
they increased their lead 20-6.
Carnegie Mellon took over the 
ball on their own 44 yard line 
after a 26-yard kickoff return by 
Siket. The Tartans kept the ball 
on the ground for three plays until 
Dee found Siket down the left 
sideline and completed a 27-yard 
touchdown pass. The Tartans 
then completed a two-point con
version pass and narrowed the 
gap 20-14.
Rochester was forced to punt 
and CMU took over on their own 
20 yard line. The offense mixed 
the plays up with rushes by 
Grusky and Dee putting the ball 
in the air. The key play of the 
drive was a short pass to Siket 
who faked out the defender and 
dashed for a 49-yard gain. 
Carnegie Mellon tied the game 
on a 13-yard Horton touchdown 
rush. The offensive line did a good 
job of clearing the hole as Horton 
scrambled into the end zone un
touched. CMU took the lead 21 
20 with the extra point.
Rochester took over the ball 
with 4:55 remaining in the sec
ond quarter. Eisenberg threw 
complete to Yellowjacket fresh
man wide receiver Ronnie Ander
son. Anderson fumbled the ball 
on the play and Tartan junior 
defensive back Steve Voytovich 
recovered on the CMU 46 yard 
line. The Tartans used the clock 
well and Harding kicked his third 
field goal of the game with 12 
seconds remaining in the first 
half. The Tartans had the lead
24-20 when the first half ended.
The two teams scored a com
bined 44 points in the first half, 
while the second half saw only 14 
points. Rochester scored the first 
touchdown of the second half with 
4:20 left in the third quarter. The 
Rochester score was set up by a 
fumble recovery which gave the 
Yellowjackets good field position 
on the CMU 39-yard line. The 
scoring drive seemed stalled when 
Tartan senior defensive tackle 
Ben Burton tackled Collins for a 
six-yard loss. The Yellowjackets 
persevered and Eisenberg com
pleted a 17-yard first down pass 
on third and 17. Three plays later 
Hurd rushed for a one-yard touch
down and Rochester took over 
the lead 2724.
The CMU defense held firm and 
Carnegie Mellon, after a missed 
field goal attempt, got the ball 
back again at the start of the 
fourth quarter. CMU took over 
the ball on the Rochester 46-yard 
line. Dee completed a 38-yard 
pass to Neal which set up first 
and goal from the five yard line. 
Rochester stood their ground and 
did not allow CMU to score. Roch
ester took over the ball on their 
own one yard line.
The Tartan defense forced the 
Yellowjackets to punt, and

opportunity to take the lead. Dee 
threw an interception on the first 
play, and Rochester took over on 
the CMU 28 yard line. Rochester 
kept the ball on the ground but 
could not convert a fourth down 
and two and Carnegie Mellon took 
over on their own seven yard line.
The Tartans pounded the ball 
through the middle on the ground 
and through the air for 57 yards. 
The Tartans were then faced with 
a fourth and one situation. Dee 
had his pass deflected, and Roch
ester took over on downs with 
4:39 left in the fourth quarter.
The Tartan defense rose to the 
challenge again, forcing Roches
ter to punt after three plays. CMU 
took over on their own 25 yard 
line with 2:51 left in the game.
On the second play of the drive, 
Dee was sacked for a seven-yard 
loss which set up a third and 12. 
Dee found Neal down the right 
sideline for a drive sustaining 37- 
yard reception. After a Grusky 
run for 2 yards, Dee threw two 
incomplete passes, and the Tar
tans faced a fourth and eight. Dee 
returned to his favorite target, 
Aaron Neal and completed a 12- 
yard first down pass.
Dee stayed in the air with a 
pass to senior wide receiver Andy 
Van Sprang. The pass was bro
ken up, but Rochester was called 
for defensive pass interference. 
The 15-yard penalty moved the 
ball to the Rochester 11 yard line 
with 43 seconds left in the game. 
Dee handed the ball off to Grusky 
who rambled for sevenyards then 
ran for two yards which gave the 
Tartans a third down and two on 
the Rochester three yard line.
Dee dropped back and found 
Mathias open in the end zone 
with six seconds to play. The 
touchdown capped off a 75-yard,
12 play drive. Harding added the 
extra point and CMU won 3127.
It was the greatest game over 
here. We knew if we gave Chris 
time, he would hit the open re
ceiver, said senior offensive 
guard John Cain.
A great game, with two great 
universities and great student 
athletes. I guess we had the ball 
last. Chris Dees decisionmaking 
was excellent. We are a team that 
tries to mix up the plays and be 
balanced. Rochester is a physical 
team which you must pass 
against, because youre not going 
to pound them down the field, 
said Lackner.
The Tartan victory was a battle 
on both sides of the ball. The 
defense stood solid against Roch
ester and allowed the offense the 
time to score. Senior inside line
backer Chad Wilson and senior 
inside linebacker Jeff Blue once 
again led the Tartan defense in 
tackling.
Burton, Voytovich, sophomore 
outside linebacker Mark 
Kasperowicz, senior outside line
backer John Knutson and fresh
man defensive back/special team= 
player Nate Morgan all registered 
multiple tackles and were instru
mental in the Tartan win.
One downside to the game was 
that the Tartans will lose one of 
their starters, junior halfback Jim 
Filicko for the entire season be
cause of a severe knee injury he 
suffered during the game.
Junior defensive tackle Merle 
Atkinson also went down with a 
knee injury on Saturday but is 
expected to return to action this 
season.
The Tartans stay on the road 
and face the Juniata College In
dians on September 25 at 1:30

The Tartans then return to 
Gesling Stadium and face power
house Allegheny College in the

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  20 September 199311
Canadiens look to defend the Cup
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
The Northeast division figures 
to be one of the toughest, if not 
the toughest division in the NHL. 
Heres a preview of each team, in 
predicted finishing order: 
Montreal Canadiens
The 1993 Stanley Cup Cham
pion Canadiens should be very 
difficult to dethrone. While the 
Canadiens are not an overpower
ing team, they will beat oppo
nents left and right with their 
strong, young defensive corps, 
superb goaltending, and a work 
ethic second to none.
The teams heart and soul is 
spread between three players. 
Captain and center Guy Carbonneau is not much of an offensive 
threat but is a defensive power
house, particularly on the pen
alty killing unit. The heir appar
ent to the Canadiens captaincy 
is center Kirk Muller. Muller has 
developed into one of the top five 
two-way players in the league. 
He tied his career-high 94 points 
last season (37 goals, 57 assists). 
His somewhat modest offensive 
statistics are augmented by his 
defensive play, particularly on 
face-offs.
In the Stanley Cup final against 
Los Angeles, Muller won over 70 
percent of the face-offs he took. 
His on and off-ice leadership is 
also a great asset.
Muller would easily be called 
the Canadiens most valuable 
player if it wasnt for the pres
ence of goaltender Patrick Roy. 
Roy is one of the best goaltenders 
ever. His excellent play seems to 
turn up a few notches in the play
offs, during which its nearly im
possible to get the puck past him.
Quebec Nordiques
After years of mediocre to aw
ful play, the Nordiques have risen 
to greatness. Quebecs clear 
strength is in their offense as 
they have some highly talented 
young forwards. Center Joe Sakic 
leads the teams goal scoring with 
an impressive supporting cast of 
Mats Sundin, Owen Nolan, Mike 
Ricci, Valeri Kamensky, and 
defensemen Curtis Leschyshyn 
and Steve Duchesne.
Look for Swedish phenom Pe
ter Forsberg to break into the 
league this season. Forsberg is 
just 19 years old and was the 
scoring leader during both the 
World Junior Championships (31 
total points, a record) and in the 
Swedish Elite League (23 goals, 
24 assists in just 39 games).
Quebecs main weakness is in 
goal. Goaltending powerhouse 
Ron Hextall was traded to the 
New York Islanders during the 
off season. Stephane Fiset should 
get the starting job. Fiset is defi
nitely a talented goalie but can be 
inconsistent and tends to fall 
apart if the defense falls apart in 
front of him. Rookie John Tanner 
will probably be the number two 
man.
Pittsburgh Penguins
The big word in the Penguins 
vocabulary this season is if. If 
Mario Lemieux can beat his se
ries of injuries; if Kevin Stevens 
can return to his fantastic play 
after severe facial injuries and 
chronic knee problems; if Ron 
Francis and coach Eddie Johnston 
can bury the hatchet; and if highpriced rookie Markus Naslund 
pays off, then perhaps the Pen
guins have a shot at another 
Stanley Cup.
Unfortunately, the Penguins 
have already lost Lemieux for the 
first few weeks of the season. He 
is still recovering from the sur
gery he went through late in the 
summer.
There is no set time frame for 
his return to the ice, nor will he 
even be practicing for at least
another three to four weeks. Back 
injury aside, Lemieuxs recent 
bout with Hodgkins Disease 
could sideline him for good if he 
suffers a relapse. Le Magnifique 
is the top player of today, but his 
days could be numbered.
The potential loss of Lemieux 
makes the trade of up and coming 
center Shawn McEachem to Los 
Angeles for veteran, bone crush
ing defenseman Marty McSorley 
even more dubious. McEachern 
was a Penguin of the futurehe 
scored 28 goals and 33 assists 
during last season, his rookie 
year. The acquisition of McSorley 
adds another problem. Last sea
son, McSorley racked up 399 pen
alty minutes. Combine this total 
with defensemen Ulf Samuelssons (249 minutes) and right 
wing Rick Tocchets (252 Min
utes) totals, and the Penguins 
could find themselves in far too 
many shorthanded situations. 
Last year, the Penguins power 
play unit was rather porous on 
defense. The Pens allowed in 19 
shorthanded goals, the worst in 
the NHL.
Buffalo Sabres
Buffalo is one of the most im
proved teams of the past few 
years. Center Pat LaFontaine has 
found his niche as one of the 
Leagues true superstars. Last 
season, he was a definite candi
date for the Hart Trophy with his 
53 goals, 148 points, and20 power 
play goals.
LaFontaine is also one of the 
best leaders. Backing up 
LaFontaine at center is also-superstar Dale Hawerchuck. 
Hawerchucks goal scoring has 
declined as of late but he remains 
a superior playmaker; he notched 
80 assists last season.
Right wing Alexander Mogilny 
is the best winger in the game 
today. He led the NHL last sea
son with 76 goals. This total also 
set the NHL record for most goals 
by a right wing. His 27 power 
play goals was one of the best 
totals. This will be just his fifth
year in the NHL and his play has 
just gotten better and better.
The Sabres real weak point is 
on defense. The teams blueliners 
are average at best. The shining 
defensive star for Buffalo is 
goaltender Grant Fuhr. Fuhr is 
one of the all-time best and al
ways seems to come up with the 
big saves. If Buffalo wants to stay 
in contention, theyd better look 
into acquiring some new 
defensemen.
Boston Bruins
The Boston Bruins will be a 
solid team as usual, but their 
prospects are declining as key 
players either age or are traded. 
The Bruins team is well rounded 
with fine balance between offense 
and defense.
Adam Oates, Joe Juneau, and 
Cam Neely lead the teams of
fense. The weak point in this of
fensive duo is Neelys knees. He 
played in just 13 games last sea
son. However, in those 13 games, 
he scored 11 goals and 18 points. 
If he can stay healthy, Neely is a 
proven 50 goal scorer and is one 
of the most powerful forwards in 
the game. Oates superb 
playmaking complements Neelys 
scoring touch. Juneau scored 32 
goals and 102 points last year as 
a rookie.
Ray Bourque is a stalwart on 
defense, as he always has been. 
He is definitely the quarterback 
of the team, coordinating both 
offense and defense.
Bourque is always one of the 
top scorers on the team and he 
also one of the toughest checkers 
and best shot blockers in the NHL. 
Unfortunately, he is going to be 
33 years old.
Its unlikely that he can con
tinue to rack up 35-40 minutes of 
ice time per game for much longer.
Besides Bourque, the Bruins 
are relatively weak on defense, 
which is why it is so critical for 
him to play as much as he does.
Goaltender is also another 
somewhat weak position. Starter 
Jon Casey is solid, but tends to be

The Gym Rat
by L W. Kochanskyj
Next year, the World Cup will 
be held in the United States, in 
sites like Foxboro Stadium (Mas
sachusetts), Giants Stadium 
L (New Jersey), Soldier Field (Illi
nois), and the Silverdome (Michi
gan). In New Jersey and Michi
gan, the artifical turf will be 
pulled up in favor of the natural 
stuff. Good luck Motor City, it 
I will be like growing grass in your 
living room.
Many believe the Cup will act 
as a catalyst for a new outdoor 
soccer league in the United 
States. I hope so. It seems only 
right that such a league should 
exist. Millions of people play soc
cer in this country, and millions 
more the world round.
I remember the North Ameri
can Soccer League (NASL) that 
existed back in the 1970s-1980s. 
Being from New York, I rooted 
for the New York Cosmos, and 
even attended a few of their 
games. I still remember some of 
the other teams in the league: 
The New England Teamen, Roch
ester Lancers, Portland Timbers, 
San Jose Earthquakes, Tampa 
Bay Rowdies, and Los Angeles 
Aztecs.
I remember one player in par
ticular who played for the Cos
mos: Pel. Many say that he is
the best soccer player in the world. 
I couldnt agree more.
The NASL eventually folded, 
but there is talk of starting a new 
league. This time, I think the 
situation is right for a success.
With the proliferation of cable 
television, a new league should 
be able to sign a contract with one 
station or another, and maybe 
one of the major networks could 
carry a game on the weekend, 
like ABC did with the NASL.
I am excited about the World 
Cup coming to America. It will be 
interesting to see the fan turnout 
at each site, and how many are 
American and how many are for
eign. This could figure in the 
amount of optimism a new league 
would have for gauging viewer 
interest.
I am especially going to be look
ing out for the English fans, who
have a history of violence and 
hooliganism at soccer matches. I 
lived in England for awhile but 
never went to a match for fear I 
would get my head bashed in. 
These fans will come to American 
stadiums and be able to buy beer 
while watching the game. That is 
unheard of in England  sort of 
like putting gasoline on a fire. 
They are also used to police who 
dont carry weapons. All of these 
factors could develop into some 
serious trouble.
If any foreigner gets too rowdy, 
they could always be sent to Joe 
Robbie Stadium in Miami.
Florida seems to love foreign
ers these days, especially with 
rental cars.

Jam Time! 
By Dizzy Murphy
This off-season has been a tumultuous one for the National 
Basketball Association. From the death of two of the leagues rising 
stars to the many trades and the yearly draft, the league has 
undergone a number of changes since the 1992-93 season concluded.
Tragedy dominated many of the hoops headlines, as Boston Celtics 
captain Reggie Lewis and New Jersey Nets All-Star Drazen Petrovic 
died, Lewis from a heart condition and Petrovic in an automobile 
accident.
The ailing Boston Celtics are going to retire Lewiss jersey in a 
ceremony slated for the 94-95 season. Another Celtic whose number 
. will be hoisted to the rafters is veteran forward Kevin McHale, who 
retired at the conclusion of last season. His number will be retiredin 
a game against the Phoenix Suns on Jan. 30.
Speaking of the Suns, the runner-up to the championship has lost

streaky. Backup John Blues true 
potential is a somewhat un
known, and he probably cant 
carry the team if Casey is injured 
for a prolonged period.
Hartford Whalers
Hartford is a rebuilding team. 
The teams future hopes are cen
tered around young left wing 
Geoff Sanderson. He led the team 
in scoring last season with 48 
goals and 89 points. Defense is a 
big problem for the team even 
though they have two standouts. 
Zarley Zalapski and Eric 
Weinrich are both solid blueliners 
but the other defensemen are 
nothing to be very proud of. The 
Whalers have an outstanding 
goaltender in Sean Burke, but 
his play is highly erratic. If Burke 
falters as he has in the past, back
ups Mario Gosselin and Frank 
Pietrangelo are there, but nei
ther is a starter caliber goalie.
Ottawa Senators
The Ottawa Senators are ready 
for their second season, and it 
will likely end up the way the 
first did: in last place. The only 
ray of hope for Ottawa is that 
there are two even newer teams 
who will likely be worse.
The best thing the Senators 
have on their side is time. The 
teams draft choices this past year 
reflect their hopes for the future, 
especially number one pick 
Alexandre Daigle.
Last year in junior hockey, 
Daigle scored 137 points in just 
53 games. Hes said to be the best 
French-Canadian prospect since 
Mario Lemieux. His speed, puck 
handling, and scoring talent in
sure that hell be a superstar one 
day.

camps are open, exhibition games 
are underway, and the season 
opens in just a few weeks.

SOCCER, from page 9
It was the Tartans who tal
lied yet another goal, this one 
by freshman Thomas Layton. 
This gives him three goals on 
the young season to lead the 
team. Layton beat the goalie 
with a chip shot that tucked 
in just under the cross bar.
Washington missed on a 
number of scoring opportuni
ties. Then they were given an 
almost definite chance to 
score when a penalty kick was 
called for a hand ball in the 
box. Shapiro stood tall and 
defended his goal.
I saw as soon as he got up 
there which way he was go
ing. As soon as he was about 
to strike the ball, his thigh 
opened. Which meant that he 
was going to my left. It was 
just a matter of me getting to 
the ball. I wish I could have 
held on to it.
Too bad he didnt because it 
was an impressive save. Un
fortunately, the rebound 
bounced out right on the foot 
of junior Kevin Neebes.
He struck the ball power
fully. I didnt have much re
action time, said Shapiro. 
The shot hit Shapiro but man
aged to trickle by him into the 
goal.
The goal was the only blem
ish on his performance for the 
day. It looked like the goal 
would get the Bears started, 
but it wasnt to be as the Tar
tans dominated the remain
der of the game, with great 
forechecking by Layton.
A 3-1 win. We cant ask for 
much more, said Shapiro. 
Our goal this season is to 
make the tournament. This 
year I really see some enthu
siasm and dedication. We 
want to win the UAA and 
make the tournament.
This week the Tartans have 
three contests, at home 
against LaRoche, Waynesburg, and Allegheny Colleges.

Baseball with Andy
by Andy Glendinning
Well, theyve decided to do it; next 
year Major League Baseball will be split 
into six divisions; an east, central, and 
west in each league.
The AL East will be the Blue Jays, 
Yankees, Orioles, Tigers, and Red Sox, 
while the White Sox, Royals, Brewers, 
Twins, and Indians make up the AL 
Central.
The AL West contains the As, Rangrealigns
ers, Angels, and Mariners.
In the National League, the East is 
made up of the Phillies, Braves, Expos, 
Marlins, and Mets; the Central holds 
the Pirates, Cards, Cubs, Reds, and 
Astros; the West has the Rockies, Pa
dres, Dodgers, and Giants.
Eight teams will be going to the play
offs, one from each division and a wild 
card team from each league.
I might as well just come right out and 
say it: I dont like the realignment. Its 
not that I just dont like the way that 
they arranged the teams (actually I think 
thats about the only sensible thing that 
theyve done), I just hate the whole idea 
of putting more teams in the playoffs.
The owners keep saying that this new 
format was designed to maintain fan 
interest. Why do I just have trouble 
believing that? The only interest the
owners are concerned about in all this is 
the interest that shows up on their 
monthly bank statement.
Imagine being able to sell twice the 
number of playoff tickets; what owner is 
going to refuse that? Baseball will also 
be raking in the dough from television 
coverage of the games, being able to 
broadcast three times the number of 
playoff games to the couch potato con
tingent. But hey! That means more cool 
Bud Light commercials. Is it too late to 
change my opinion on this?
I hear that the National Scalpers Union 
is really against all of this too. With the 
sudden glut of playoff tickets on the 
market, the scalpers are going to have to 
work longer hours to earn anywhere 
near the money they take in now; its 
simple economics. If somethings widely 
available, people dont want to pay out
rageous prices for it. Makes you wonder 
why tuition costs so much ... but I di
gress.
Dividing the leagues even further than 
they are now causes the regular season 
play to be unimportant. If an entire 
division has a mediocre year  I wont 
even mention the AL Central r a team 
with a significantly lower record than 
those in the rest of the leagues could 
make the playoffs, get really lucky, and 
take the World Series.
People have long complained that 
sports like basketball and hockey ren
der the regular season useless with ex
tended playoffs. Baseball has long been 
a sport with standards higher than all 
the others. Teams were forced to play 
their best through the end of the season 
if they wanted to win, not just secure a 
spot in the playoffs and then sit back and
interest
sleep the last games of the season away.
With the new changes, teams become 
less worried about their records com
pared to league standards and only worry 
about being better than the other teams 
in their division. They grow lazy, only 
concerned with being better than the S 
neighbors. League standards drop be. 
cause teams dontcare aboutbeinggood, 
just better.
The average Americans, taking their 
cue from major league sports, slack off, 
no longer concerned with a moral stan- f I 
dard as long as they can delude them-| 
selves into thinking that they are better | 
than everyone else.
And the Japanese buy out our coun-,| 
try. But I digress....

Volleyball team up despite slow start
By RAMSEY HONG
Tartan Art Editor
The CMU Tartans Womens Volleyball team was 
optimistic and positive last Tuesday after they 
played the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown 
team and lost three games out of five. Their level of 
play throughout all three games against the divi
sion II (one division above the Tartans) Johnstown 
team was highly competitive. It reached its peak at 
the end of the third game when freshman Stephanie 
Postals serving brought the score from 9-14 to 14 
14 and it seemed that the Tartans would come back 
with a victory.
At that point both teams fought unceasingly, 
bringing loud cheers from the spectators every 
time a sideout occurred. The fact that the Tartans 
lost 14-16 seemed an unimportant and slightly 
disappointing detail compared to the exciting vol
leyball that the two teams displayed for our enter
tainment.
After the game Coach Heather Hollands said 
there were a lot of small victories and that the 
team put up a lot of fight which was evident to 
anyone who had watched them play. Hollands
professional optimism was revealed in her belief 
that games like this helps us beat other teams 
and that it was a positive step.
Freshman Sarah Pacocha, one of three setters on 
the team and a starter, said that they were down 
in the first game, but that they were passing 
really well. On the court, setters Pacocha and 
junior Molly Brennan played in a different ar
rangement that Pacocha said was good because it 
gives Molly a chance [to hit more]. Brennan is 
valuable as a setter as well as a hitter.
Brennan agreed. 6-2 allows me to hit, said 
Brennan, referring to an arrangement on the court 
where there are 6 hitters and 2 setters. She also 
said that this arrangement was good for both her 
and Pacocha.
Sophmore defensive specialist Wendy Burton, 
in an attempt to save the ball, had everyone on the 
edge of their seats as she dove, kept the ball in play, 
and hit her head hard on the ground. Fortunately 
she didnt suffer any serious injuries.
Junior Carolyn Skarada said, [the game was] a 
turning point for us.
At the River City Tournament at Marietta Col
lege on last Friday and Saturday the Tartans
suffered a number of losses as well. The Tartans 
played in a tough pool as they were defeated by 
Hanover onFriday and Allegheny andMuskingum 
on Saturday.
When asked about her expectations after the 
tournament Hollands said, we knew we were 
going to have a tough pool, but that [they] expected 
to play well.
She said that they should have been able to beat 
Hanover and been more competitive with 
Muskingum and Allegheny.
Hollands attributed their losses to a number of 
unforced errors. She said, this weekend was hard 
... emotionally in answer to a question dealing 
with things that the reader may not realize just 
reading about the games.
She said that volleyball, being a team sport is a 
game of a combination of people and when its not 
smooth theres a greater chance for things to go 
wrong.
Even though Hollands had to deal with the 
stressful experience the team had just undergone, 
her final statement revealed some insightful opti
mism. From this experience were going to be 
improving a lot, she said.Jim Snyder/Tartan Photographer

A Tartan Across the Ocean
by Gary Wilson
After a summer of many changes in the world of 
professional hockey, we can be expecting a season 
fall of surprises. First of all, the most dedicated of 
hockey fans will spend the next few months or 
more adjusting to the new divisional allignments. 
Although the whole system will provide a more fair 
playoff system, its going to take some getting used 
to.
Along with new divisions, the NHL is introduc
ing two more expansion teams: the Anaheim Mighty 
Ducks and the Florida Panthers. With the total 
now up to five expansion teams in a league where 
high scoring games have become the norm, we can 
probably expect a record number of goals to be 
scored this season.
As far as new faces are concerned, the European 
market has continued to supply a wealth of talent. 
Swedish forward Peter Forsberg promises to add a 
great deal of offense to the already ridiculously 
gifted Quebec Nordiques lineup.
It is rumored that fellow Swede and Pittsburgh 
Penguin, Markus Naslund, will get a shot at play
ing on a line with Mario Lemieux. If he does, he has 
the potential to score many goals.
Also, Winnepegs Teemu Selanne, already a 
superstar after only one season, is likely to con
tinue in his high-scoring ways.
This summer also featured a good deal of goalieswapping. Many of these deals will have an imme
diate impact on the teams involved.
The Boston Bruins may have found exactly what 
thev,ieed in Jon Casey, when they sent aging 
netjminder Andy Moog to Dallas. Moog just may 
sink with the rest of the Stars while Casey helps 
lead his team in the toughest division ever as
sembled.
Shortly before the expansion draft, the Nordiques 
gave goaltender Ron Hextall to the New York 
Islanders and got nothing in return. Despite the 
fact that Quebec may score enough goals each 
game to merit not using a goalie, they still should 
think about who is going to fill that role. As of right 
now, they are holding one of the best offensive
teams with the worst goalie situation in the league.
Meanwhile, the rising Islanders ought to benefit 
tremendously from having Hextall on their side.
Several other goaltending moves, mostly involv
ing expansion clubs, have contributed to the list of 
notable changes going into the season. The ques
tion of whos the number one man in New York has 
finally been answered as the Rangers Mike Rich
ter will be starting in Manhattan, while former 
teammate John Vanbiesbrouck has gone south to 
Florida.
Several late season injuries may help provide a 
shift in the balance of power amongthe leagues top 
scorers. Both Pittsburghs Kevin Stevens and 
Buffalos Alexander Mogilny suffered serious inju
ries in the playoffs. These two incredibly gifted 
forwards scored a combined 131 goals last season. 
However, it is doubtful that either one will recover 
to top form until later in the season.
The Rangers 100-point defenseman, Brian 
Leetch, spent all of last season trying out a variety 
of new injuries. He may need another year before 
reclaiming his throne as the leagues best offensive-defenseman. And of course, there is always 
the question of Lemieuxs back.
So, who do we look to to fill these holes? Who will 
be this years premier players?
The IslandersPierre Turgeon ought tobestrongly 
considered for the role. After fully recovering from 
his cheap-shot playoff injury and after arming 
himself with a new monster contract, Turgeon is 
ready to be a superstar. You can also expect a 
strong comeback from St. Louis goal-scoring ma
chine, Brett Hull.
However, Turgeon, Selanne, and Lemieux figure 
to fight it out for this years scoring title. Expect 
Buffalos Pat LaFontaine and Detroits Steve 
Yzerman to be close behind. Wayne Gretzky may 
also have another great year, despite his many 
problems. He is playing the weakest division, with 
two expansion teams and the talent-depleted 
Edmonton Oilers. (That means 19 potential fourfive point nights in division games alone.)
And now, the most important issue: who will be 
the best teams in 1993-94 and why?
Well, if talent is the only factor, you can count on 
Vancouver, the Rangers, Pittsburgh, and Detroit.
However, it is not nearly that simple. Despite 
their tremendous wealth, of star players, the Pen
guins will not have what it takes to dominate the 
Northeast Division like they did the Patrick Divi
sion. (At least not during the regular season.)
Between Pittsburgh, Montreal, Boston, Quebec 
and Buffalo, there promises to be plenty of exciting
divisional action this year.
In the end, Coach Brian Sutter will lead his 
Boston Bruins to the division title.
In the Atlantic Division (or former Patrick Divi
sion), the Islanders are the team to beat. Its been 
a long time since this team has been in control. For 
the second straight year, Hextall will find himself 
leading a group of underachievers to stardom.
On the other side of town, the Rangers will most 
certainly improve under new head coach, Mike 
Keenan. Keenan has a very strong group of veter
ans, along with some talented young stars.
The Central Division will be facing a classic 
showdown this year.
With the miraculous goaltending of FelixPotvin, 
and the brilliant defensive coaching of Pat Burns, 
the Toronto Maple Leafs will be one tough team to 
score on, let alone beat.
However, they will be going head to head with 
the powerful and talented Detroit Red Wings, 
under the supervision of legendary coach Scotty 
Bowman. The work ethic of the Chicago Blackhawks 
wont be enough to make up for their skimpy 
offense, especially with forward Steve Larmer on 
his way out. Its all down hill for the Hawks this 
year.
Underthenew playoff system, the former Smythe 
Division (now Pacific Division) may only be send
ing two or three representatives to the playoffs this 
year.
The Oilers, Ducks, and San Jose Sharks have 
already pleaded no contest. That leaves Los Ange
les, Vancouver and Calgary to argue over who 
rules the West.
None of the teams in this division, with the 
exception of Vancouver, have any concept of 
goaltending.
Because of that, and a variety of other reasons, 
like scoring machines Trevor Linden and Pavel 
Bure, the Vancouver Canucks will repeat as regu
lar season champs yet again.
Even come playoff time, predicting a Stanley 
Cup champion can be impossible.
However, as the teams prepare to open up the 
season with a new look, the Penguins and the 
Redwings seem to have the best chances ofmeeting 
with Pittsburgh reclaiming the Cup.
With the chaos that comes in every NHL season, 
dont be surprised if you see a match-up instead 
between the Rangers and the St. Louis Blues come 
this Spring.

was Tom Chambers, who will now be shooting

On other news around the league, the Pacers 
have signed center Scott Haskin of Oregon State, 
^hsir number one draft choice. The Washington 
Bullets signed the tallest player ever drafted in 
the league(7 foot 7 inch), center Gheorghe
Muresan of Romania, although the team was re
portedly disappointed he did not opt to get some 
seasoninginEurope. Another very bigman,Manute 
Bol, lost his job with the 76ers to an even bigger 
man, Shawn Bradley, the second overall pickin the 
draft. Bradley, the drafts biggest project, will be 
tutored by ex-Sixer Moses Malone in hopes he will 
provide the presence in the middle Bol, Andrew 
Lang, and Charles Shackleford never had.
The Celtics hope to fill some huge holes with the 
signing of college basketballs all-time assistleader

The Milwaukee Bucks have signed forward Vin 
Baker from Hartford, their first round pick, to a 10-
year contract. According to some reports, he 
might need all 10 of those years to develop into 
a quality player.
The Sacramento Kings have signed the 1992 
MVP of the Final Four. Yes, for all of you Duke 
fans, Bobby Hurley has signed with the Kings, 
where he will compete with Spud Webb for

I have to apologize for the lack of game excite

away. In the meantime, Ill do my best to keep 
you posted of important hews going around the

Long-term signings mark salary caps arrival
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
Are these recent long-term 
signings a sign of things to 
come? You bet Emmitt Smiths 
signing bonus they are. Last week 
Emmitt Smith signed for big 
money. It included a $4 million 
signing bonus and just over $2 
million annually for four years.
Barry Fosters contract has 
been extended, including a mil
lion dollar signing bonus, and 
yesterday the Steelers announced 
that Rod Woodson has signed a 
contract extension worth about 
$10 million.
Why all of a sudden? Why 
doesnt this kind of thing happen 
in baseball? There is one answer 
to both questions: the salary cap.
All of the players that have 
signed (and will sign in the next 
few months) are impact play
ers. These players realize their 
talent and the fact that they de
serve a large contract. With the 
upcoming salary cap in1994, each 
NFL team will only be able to 
afford two, maybe three, impact 
players. Therefore, these players 
are getting their cut of the pie 
before their respective teams 
meet their cap.
In baseball this is not the case 
because there is no salary cap. 
Teams can spend as much as they 
want so players think that teams 
will spend everything they have 
to build a talented team. Since 
this has been generally true in 
the last few years, players tend to
sign shorter, more expensive con
tracts. This allows them to leave 
after their contract runs out and 
possibly sign for more.
Football, however, is in for a 
much more pleasant fate. With 
the salary cap, there is a limited 
amount of money available on 
the market. Players get more 
money by signing three or four 
year contracts, thereby getting 
their piece of the pie. They might 
have to accept less per year, but 
those players who sign short con
tracts may have to sign for even 
less down the road.
There is the possibility that 
once the salary cap is in place, 
big-name free agents may not be 
able to sign for a team for more 
than $1 million because every 
team will have already used its 
revenue on the long-term con
tracts signed by its impact play
ers. Therefore, expect plenty of 
big signings of players like Barry 
Sanders before the end of 1993.
One big free agent returned to 
his team this week when Emmitt 
Smith re-signed with the Dallas 
Cowboys.
How will he help the Cowboys 
recover in 1993? The Cowboys 
are in a good position with Smith 
now. They have a game with Phoe
nix and then a week off. This is 
perfect. It will give Smith his 
preseason game, and then a week 
off to get back into shape. Not to 
insult Phoenix, but the Cowboys 
will be more concerned about 
Smiths return than with them. 
Rookie Derrick Lassie, the cur
rent running back for the Boys 
has proven he has talent, but 
needs more seasoning. Smiths 
return is just what the doctor 
ordered for the ailing offense.
Expect the Cowboys to return 
as a competitor after their week 
off. The bye will give Jimmy
Johnson a chance to regroup and 
get Smith in shape. However, 
some permanent damage has 
been done to the 1993 Cowboys. 
Besides the poor start, the Cow
boys have shown the NFL that 
they are human without Smith. 
Every opponent from now until 
January will attempt to neutral
ize Smith in order to beat the 
Cowboys. This doesnt mean the 
Cowboys wont be tough, but once 
everyone knows your strength, 
the road to the Super Bowl starts 
to get a lot longer.
Were two weeks into the sea
son and at least Im still batting 
better than Olerud. (4-6) This 
time it was the Chiefs, Packers, 
and Redskins that let me down.
The Packers were close (but no 
cigar), losing to the Eagles 20- 
17.
The Chiefs thought they were 
still in practice without Joe Mon
tana, losing to the Oilers 30-0.
And the Redskins got beaten 
by the Cardinals after a fine per
formance against the Cowboys 
on Monday Night Football. How
ever, by farthe worst performance 
of Week two was turned in by the 
Steelers. The only thing the 
Steelers didnt do wrong was to 
go home immediately.
For this horrible performance, 
the Steelers join the Oilers on the 
list of Bosworth Award winners 
for 1993. Despite their struggling 
AFC Central division foes, the 
Browns win the Team of the 
Week award for Week two. Their 
effective game plan never allowed 
Steve Young the chance to get the 
49ers back into the game last 
Monday. Also last week the Bron
cos beat the Chargers, and the 
Bills beat the Cowboys 13-10.

Top Five Picks for Week 4 
by Tartan football columnist 
John Weber
1. San Francisco at New Orleans
Last year, this was the rival of the year. New Orleans has played well, and I think they are ready for the 
49ers. However, the 49ers are not quite ready to let New Orleans take first place. Expect a close, exciting 
game. New Orleans in OT: 23-20.
2. Miami at Buffalo
Neither team is off to a great start, however, the Bills are still playing a level above the rest of the division. 
Take the Bills at home: 28-17.
3. Cleveland at Indianapolis
The Colts and the Browns have both played well, but the Colts have not been able to create much offense. 
Even though they are at home in the dome, take the Browns: 17-9.
4. Green Bay at Minnesota
The Pack takes the show on the road to Minnesota. The Packers seem to still be a player or two away from 
the division. However, McMahon and gang are not off to a great start. Take the Vikings at home in a close 
one: 13-10.
5. Phoenix at Detroit
With the Cowboys and the Redskins off, the Lions and Cardinals become the featured teams. Both teams 
have showed they want to win and Phoenix has beaten a pretty good Redskin team. However, the Lions are 
ready to make some waves in the NFC Central. Expect the Lions to pull this one out: 20-14.

On Saturday, the womens cross-country team 
participated in the Indiana University of PA Invi
tational.
The team competed with a strohg group of schools, 
most who were in Division II. Host college Indiana 
won the meet with 33 points. Second was BaldwinWallace College with 46 points. Wheeling Jesuit 
College took third (86) and Lock Haven was fourth 
with 113 points.
The Tartans placed fifth with 175 points. Lead
ing the team was sophomore Missy Baustert who 
finished in seventh place with a time of 20:15. 
Becky Buchhest took twentieth place with a time of 
21:12. Rounding out the top five was Sangita 
Jinwala (41st- 22:15), co-captain Cynthia 
Kolanowski (49th 22:29), and co-captain Jody 
Piccolo (58th-23:09).
Womens Cross-country team runs at IUP
Head coach Dario Donatelli was very happy with 
the teams results.
I was very pleased with my third, fourth, and 
fifth runners who moved up in the pack. The 
competition up front was very stiff.
There was over 100 runners participating in the 
meet, which is unusual for the Tartans. I wanted 
to give them the experience of running with people 
in front, along side, and behind them, said 
Donatelli.
The times were slower than usual, but Donatelli 
attributed this to the warm weather, and a number 
of the Tartan runners becoming ill on the bus trip 
up.
This is the largest meet the team will have 
before the regionals. Indian is comparable to Emory 
(which is in the UAA) so it was a good experience 
running against them, said Donatelli.
This Saturday the team travels to Dickinson 
College for their invitational meet.

You know, central Vermont is awfully pretty this time of year. I drove through Vermont on my way from Maine to 
Pittsburgh at the end of August. There's a long snaky interstate that slithers its way through the mountains in the 
middle of Vermont, and these mountains are lush and green and have no tree lines. Now, anybody from Maine or the 
Rockies or the Himalayas or anywhere else that has mountains with proper tree lines knows that a mountain with solid 
green forest all the way up to the peak looks like a hill. No matter how high it is, it will always look like a hill. So there

seen each other for a while meet randomly on the street. The first one, John asks how the other, Henry, is doing. Henry replies "Fine, fine. Im learning more now than I ever have before. In the morning I 
listen to the radio in the shower to get the news. When I shave, I 
have French vocabulary taped to tne mirror so I can memorize new words for my upcoming trip to France. At breakfast, I read a 
book. During lunch, I practice algebra problems..." Henry 
continues like this for a while and 
ends by saying "Every moment of 
my day is spent learning 
something new. It s incredible!"
John looks at him for a moment 
and asks "This is true, but when do 
you have time to think?"

METH-DAYS
WORDS BY: Andrew Sproule 
DESIGN BY: Ryan J. McGinness
You became a fascist. At least, thats what Dave 
said. He and I were headed towards the methadone clinic.
It had been a no-money week and we needed a little 
something to tide us over until some came in. You always 
enjoyed, as you called them, meth-days, free junk and time 
to let the veins heal.
Yep, joined that cult and became a fascist, Dave 
tried to explain.They dont drink, do drugs, smoke, have 
sex, or even go out on 
dates. Complete and total 
abstinence. God is all they 
live for. Left us completely 
alone. No money and no 
dope, he went on.
How did that 
make you a fascist? Did 
believing in God make you 
a fascist? The only person 
that I vaguely remembered
being called a fascist was Mussolini. He made the trains run 
on time. I was confused and starting to get jittery. You 
always kept me still when I needed to shoot.
Confused and jittery, until I met you. I remembered 
when you and S had met at the after hours party in the 
warehouse. I was drunk. I felt so good. I had never had 
a drink before and I liked it.You walked up to me, like 
we had been childhood friends.
Dont look so scared. Its just a party. None of 
these people are any different from you. I mean, 
if they were, they wouldnt be here, you said.
I didnt even know what to say back 
to you.Forthe first time in my life I met 
someone that knew what I felt.
You started kissing me. I had never 
kissed a man before and I liked it.We went to the 
room where you made love to me. Later you taught me how 
so sick. I liked it.

---------------------------------------------------

waiting for weeks.Its not just what they believe, its that they try to make everybody have the same 
beliefs.Always trying to get converts, Dave said, in between glances at his watch.They prey on the 
naive, unsuspecting and troubled.Try to give them something to fill the hole in an otherwise pointless 
life, said Dave.
We were getting closer and closer to the window 
that was dispensing the methadone. Why did you leave 
us? You always made sure we had enough money to get 
our fix, perfectly planned around the meth-days. You 
always hooked up with someone who would give you 
money. What are we supposed to do now?
Look here, enough junk to last us a couple 
of weeks. As long as we dont tell Dave about it, 
you said.
Wow, whered you get the money for all of 
that? You mustve killed a dealer or something. 
It was so great. All those drugs and you 
were so happy. After we shot up, you kept saying 
how great it would be to have so much money that 
wed never have to worry about drugs. I thought 
that was funny. 1 never worried about getting 
drugs. You always got them and it never occured 
to me that you wouldnt be able to.
We took the methadone and the buzz was reaching into my stomach. Dave was mumbling something that I couldnt understand. 
I missed you so much, you bastard. You always said that if we got enough money we could head south. Was that on a train? Does God have 
enough money?
Have you ever been on a train? I love riding on trains. Its as close to being high as you can get without actually taking drugs. You 
know how, when you shoot up, that feeling starts to engulf you and you can feel the air bouncing off of your skin? Thats a train ride. Youas
can feel every single bump and jiggle as it goes down the track. If we ever 
get enough money together, well do that. Okay? you asked.
You only ever got that excited when you got more drugs. I never 
knew what made you start talking about trains.
A methadone buzz never lasts as long as heroin. I started to crash 
after about six hours. Dave had already left. This time that feeling of total 
emptiness I get when 1 come down was intensified  you were gone.
What now?
"Its all right, dont worry, this is how everybody feels when they 
crash, you said.
"I only feel normal when Im high," I said.
When I was younger I remember being in some bar and staring 
out the window at everyone walking by. All I could think was why them?
Why were they so different? Why not me? It was like everyone was in on 
some bigsecretand they decided no to let me in. Shooting kind of changes 
that. At least, it used to, you said.
It doesnt any more? Why dont you just take more?
I just get the feeling that Im gonna die. I need change, you said.
If only we could get away from here. We still didnt have enough 
money. Do you have money now that you are a fascist? Did believing in 
God make you a fascist? Dave never even mentioned trains. Can you 
make the trains run on time, now that youre a fascist? I think Mussolini
did. If so, maybe we could go to New Mexico. Do trains run south?

let me tell you, that string-bikini clad
high schooler should have stuck to the buddy system.
why didn't the lifeguard catch her leaving
the designated swimming area?
if she hadn't been eaten,
with a cellulite-free body like hers
and a high profile as that tiny gherkin,
a tiny ink blob on a poster
treading toward the filed-toothed jaws,
she'd probably be a lingerie model for sears.
if she had lived,
even if her body was the last half-chewed drumstick on 
a picnic plate,
she might have found herself in other disasters: 
snake bites, avalanches, webbed by tarantulas, 
if she had lived, she would be that woman 
whose feet turn to frozen drums in a ten day escape from 
a mountain blizzard.
i'd like to see her take on the water again,
forget that she and dozens of other 
nudie swimmers
did not come back for the sequels, 
i'd like to see her backfloat or butterfly 
along the loch ness monster, 
the haunting dinosaur who 
sometimes burbles a lonely echo of 
"aw shucks,"
and realize that monsters are not 
pettable.
truth is, they're usually hunted, 
it's likely if she found the loch ness, 
its tail would be made into a spiraling 
flagpole,
its eyes and kidneys would be packed 
in coolers and immediately used in 
transplant patients,
and yards of bones and teeth would be 
crushed and sold 
on sinewy ligaments as bracelets 
next to tie-dye and 
make-marajuana-legal t-shirts.

Therefore, I urge you, 
brothers, in view 
of God's mercy, to 
offer your bodies as 
living sacrifices, holy 
and pleasing to Godthis is your spiritual act 
of worship. Do not 
conform any longer to 
the act of this world, 
but be transformed 
by the renewing of 
your mind. Then you 
will be able to test 
and approve what 
God's will is -his 
good, pleasing and 
perfect will.
For by the grace given 
me I say to every one 
of you: Do not think 
of yourself more 
highly than you ought, 
but rather tnink or yourself with sober judgement, in accordance 
with the measure of faith God has given 
you. Just as each of us has one body with 
many measures, and these members do not 
all have the same function, so in Christ we 
who are many form one body and each 
member belongs to all the others. We have 
different gifts, according to the gracef
'iven us. if a man's gift is prophesying, 
et him use it in proportion to his raitn.
If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, 
let him teach; if it is encouraging let him 
encourage: if it is contributing to the needs 
of others, let him give generously; if it 
is leadership, let him govern diligently; if 
it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
(Romans 11:12)

It is a beautiful morning, and when we arrive, we mingle with the other 
parishioners. The service begins. We rise and sing the processional as the priest 
enters with his entourage of acolytes. The sermon is a common one in which the 
parishioners learn that they should feel guilty for their wealth, but this guilt can be 
assuaged through donations to the parish. We recognize the wisdom in this, and drop 
check in the basket with the others. When the baskets are finished circulating, they 
are laid at the foot of the altar. These tiny slips of paper are our offerings to our god.
When the priest speaks, his Jesuit trained voice is amplified by hidden micro
phones, tiny wonders of technology that give the voice enough reverb to sound 
portentous. As I doze, I dream of the priest dipping his hand into the wine chalice, 
which now is filled with liquid nitrogen. He removes his hand and deliberately flicks at his 
fingers one by one. As he flicks each frozen extremity it shatters like glass, and

Volume 88, Issue 4The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania20 September 1993Tradition molds architecture
By JULIA LaSALLE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
As a student at Carnegie Mellon it is easy to take for granted all of the fascinating things which give 
our school character. In running from breakfast to class, from class to the library, and from the library 
to a computer cluster, you dont always get to stop and look around. There is a lot of history on the campus 
to see and learn. Perhaps on your next boring Sunday morning when you do not feel quiet up to battling 
for a washing machine you could go for a walk and take advantage of all that CMU has to offer.
Some Basics: The Carnegie Mellon main campus now occupies ninety acres of land. There are 2.7 
million square feet within its forty buildings. Of these forty buildings, none are more than eight stories 
high, with the average building containing three or four floors. There are 4,300 undergraduate students 
and 2,500 graduate students with the number and quality of applications increasing each year. The 
;ampus has grown incredibly since its beginnings not quite a century ago when on November 15,1900,
Andrew Carnegie wrote to the mayor of Pittsburgh about his intentions to build a technical school in 
the city. The Mellon Institute was founded thirteen years after CIT in 1913. In 1967 the two merged to 
form Carnegie Mellon University.
Campus History: The original plans for CIT included six buildings. These buildings were designed 
by Henry Hombostel, who eventually came to serve as the first Dean of the College of Fine Arts.
Hombostel wanted to include clear, open, and free space in his plans. For this reason he designed the 
Mall, later called the Cut, around which his other buildings were organized. All of the additions to 
lampus, such as the Cut, have been carefully preserved in keeping with the open space theme. Porter, 
he first completed hall, was finished in 1906. By 1916 Margaret Morrison, Carnegie Hall, Doherty Hall, 
lammerschlag Hall, Baker Hall, and the College of Fine Arts were also completed.
Baker Hall: Baker Hall was the central building of Hombostels plans. Carnegie, however, before 
construction began, got cold feet. To accomodate his fears, Baker Hall was designed with downward 
sloping halls. If the technical school failed, according to campus legend, the building would be ready for 
use in an assembly line because it is easier roll heavy things down. Carnegies motto, My heart is in 
the work, was also included in this central building. These words can be seen in Bakers blue, stained 
'glass windows. It is also interesting to note in Baker the dated brass plates at the entrance. These plates 
represent different classes dating back to 1908.
Hunt Library: The Hunt family donated the money for its construction in 1960. When they gave their 
endowment they requested that nothing obscure the view of the library from Forbes for the next forty 
years, until the year 2000. So far nothing but a few trees and the fence have gone against the agreement.
I Mellon Institute & CFA: The front of the Mellon Institute and the CFA buildings are fascinating.
The Mellon Institute has 62 columns in front constructed of single, 60-ton pieces of limestone. The front 
of the CFA has five niches. Each niche was assigned an era: Greek, Roman, Gothic, Renaissance, and 
Moorish. Prior to 1990 only one of these niches was near completion. Then Vemer Purnell, a CFA 
alumni, made a gift to finish the others. Now after 70 years, that remodeling has begun.
I? ^Odds and Ends: Carnegie Mellon is the only university in the United States that was designed as 
a ship. Each of the buildings in the original plan were named after parts of this imaginary boat. A real 
boats prow can be seen behind Hammerschlag Hall. It was taken from the cruiser Pittsburgh.
I , Skibo was named for Andrew Carnegies castle in Scotland. It is his Scottish history that is seen today.
There are very few schools which offer a bagpiping major. Our Tartan plaid and Scottie dog mascot are 
Lother illustrations of this past.
i These facts should be enough to get you started on a Sunday morning walk. Look in your student
handbook (The Word), make an appointment to see the archives on the second floor of Hunt, or ask CUFA st?"ds mfJestlcally in the late 1940s.

Neurotic Living
by Andrew Sproule
Hi, my name is Andrew and... 
t... Im ... uh ...
Go ahead say it. Dont be 
afraid. Well, I mean, you know, 
try not to be.
Im a neurotic. There, I said 
it.
That hasnt really happened. It 
was just an idea. A support group 
for neurotics where us neurotics 
could get the help we need. It 
could be designed like an Alco
holics Anonymous (AA) meeting. 
Know what I mean? It could be a 
step program like AA where we 
work through certain steps to 
reach a point that we can handle 
our problems.
Step one: Although we still be
lieve that people are secretly 
making fun of us, we will try and 
ignore it.
Step two: If we think someone 
is staring at us, we will try to 
assume that it is because they 
find us interesting and not be
cause we are freaks.
Step three: We 
promise and believe 
that if we dont imme
diately phone our 
mothers back, we 
arent headed toward 
hell in a handbasket.
Step four: Sure, it 
may sound paranoid, 
but dwarves are steal
ing our lunches.
Sure, there would 
have to be more than 
that, but its a good 
start. That last step 
may not actually be a 
step, but hey, it needs 
to be said. Now what 
about actual meet
ings?
Maybe we could pattern the go. I wouldnt be able to concenmeetings after AA. All wed need trate. Id see a flicker of a shadow 
to do is find a dark church base- in the ceiling and start thinking,

least three fourths of my four abovenot immediately calling 
dollars and 25 cents an hour pay- my mother back.
That last para
graph gives me an
other idea for the 
group. We will have 
to put a time limit 
on people talking. 
Because, as is now 
obvious, they have 
a tendency to di
gress and ramble.
And then, what 
about the garbage? 
What are we going 
to do with all the 
trash? And then....

I think thats 
about it. All I need

Askew, No Shoes
by Matthew Messner
! For all those people out there in news! paper-land wondering how on Earth (or 
! your planet of choice) I decide what to 
! write each week, this column is for you. 
i In order for the desired epiphany of plot 
l__o occur, one must manage to enter an 
altered state of consciousness (CMU ofr ten evokes this 
naturally), or 
at the least 
provide some 
jnechanism 
through which 
$he subcon
scious can 
gpeak. (It is 
worth noting 
that uncon
sciousness often qualifies.)
This week I decided to try the innercity shaman approach. I gathered up a 
handful of shattered windshield and 
whilst pondering the grandeur of safety 
glass, tossed the shards into the air. 
From their alignment on the ground, a 
..' rskilled eye can detect the subtle will of 
^ . nature. After calculating the standard 
"deviation from the center, compass leanv ings, light diffraction, number of sides 
per shard, arrangement of tinted pieces, 
and how many stuck to my leg for how 
long when I sat on them, I was ready to 
move on to the final phase.
Utilizing a ping-pong ball, inscribed 
with the necessary sacred spray-paint 
scripts, I began to play jacks.
When all was done, the answer I had 
been searching for hit me like an axiom
atic proof. There was absolutely no order 
whatsoever in my glass divination. It 
was entirely random. Obviously, the light 
of nature seemed to have wanted me to 
enter blindly into this column (as op
posed to with the dark sunglasses which 
I usually stumble in with). Who am I to 
defy the universe?
So here I sit, in Baker Hall 140 in 
front of a little screen (the big ones 
intimidate me) knowing no better what 
I will type next then what you will read 
(assuming you are still with us at this 
point).
If calling yourself collect appealed to

any of you surrealists out there you 
should be happy to know that you can 
send e-mail directly or indirectly (via 
carbon copy) to yourself.
For that old world feel, however, I 
suggest you try campus mail. And once 
you have, there is no need to ever write 
yourself again. Simply drop the letter 
into Misaddressed Mail upon receipt 
and it will dutifully return to you within 
a few weeks. Go on, try itits fun and 
its free. (Not recommended for children 
under the age of five. As with all cyclic 
endeavors, children should not play without parental supervision. Do not put 
screws in mouth.)
Aside: If you know how to slide down 
banisters, you can actually travel faster 
than the elevators in Wean Hall.
INTERMISSION
(a small logic proof will be presented 
for those unable to leave their seats)
Proof that staircases can fly:
A staircase must consist of more than 
one stair.
More than one stair is equivalent to a 
flight of stairs.
If a staircase 
were flightless, this 
would imply it did 
not consist of more 
than one stair.
Staircases, 
therefore, be
ing necessar
ily not flight
less, must 
possess the 
ability to fly.

doubt this ar
gument at 
all, try not

week and 
then walking down 
the first stairwell

Slow people ruin everything
Horror Stories
by Tom Harper
I have a pretty hectic schedule, 
j  Yeah. Like who doesnt? you 
i * are probably asking.
 - Simple. Anyone in front of me.
; It seems whenever I have to be
j  somewhere really fast I end up 
 behind someone that does not 
!; have a schedule as hectic as mine 
| . and I end up being late,
j; For example, a few weeks ago,
I had to be at ROTC. I made the 
{j grave mistake of actually trying 
j to eat at Highlander. I thought
Id just pop in, grab a burger (Im 
addicted to Highlander burgers) 
and something to drink, and be 
out of there tout de suite, (if you
dont know French, that means 
pretty fast).
But, in front of me was this girl 
in a green jacket. She was in line 
before me and, for some reason, 
she forgot that you must present 
your ID card and have it put 
through the register. So she dug 
into her purse and tried to locate 
it for a minute and a half. Mean
while this crazy guy in an Army 
uniform (that would be me) is 
ready to tear what was left of his 
hair out becauseeueobody knows 
you must present your ID to the 
person behind the register!
So, lunch that day consisted of 
a bagel and cream cheese with 
Donner 2-East water. Hey, its 
good water. Igotbacktomyroom, 
hoisted my duffel bag onto my 
shoulders and walked to the Ca
thedral of Learning. Of course, 
the Bad Luck gods werent 
through with me just yet.
I ended up behind these guys in 
spandex who were in absolutely 
no hurry to be anywhere at all.
Never mind this guy behind them 
in the sweated-through Army 
uniform with a fifty-pound duffel 
bag on his shoulders.
Meanwhile Im plodding along 
in back of them grinding my teeth 
and thinking of ways to exact my 
revenge. Theyre kind of grue
some, and they involve electrodes' 
and a potato peeler.
I hope those guys are happy, 
because I was three minutes late 
for class.
And spealdng of happy, why is 
it whenever I get the chance to be 
in a good mood everybody else 
has a look on their face that says, 
Ive had the worst day of my life. 
Get away from me.
Normally, Im the one with a 
scowl and (you guessed it!) every
one else is having the biggest 
blast of their entire lives which 
makes me evenmadder than what 
I was when I walked out of what
ever building I was in having an 
extremely awful time.

Stearns writes Industrialization book
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Features Editor
Peter Steams, dean of Humanities 
and Social Sciences, has recently pub
lished a new book, The Industrial Revo
lution in World History. The book is
first in a series which ------------------
may grow to include 
seven or eight titles.
Steams says the book 
was published as an in
formative alternative to 
a textbook which would 
still provide detail but 
not be too broad or 
vague.
Its become possible 
to focus on interesting, 
specific themes in a world context which 
lead to livelier and more diverse read
ing, says Steams.
The book is also different in its form 
of approach. I tried to get information 
about what kinds of impact the Indus
trial Revolution had outside of Europe, 
he says.
I tried to pull it all together into a 
periodization scheme that would fit not 
only Europe, but the rest of the world. 
I was surprised no one had tackled the
subject in an international context. It really 
allows people to look at major issues in a 
new way.
Steams book also aims at providing new 
insight into the worlds economic system. 
Most students have been taught that Eu
rope was the only country which experiIt was a fun book to write ... I wanted to 
include real stories, such as personal ex
periences of workers in the factories, for 
the readers."
 Peter Stearns, dean of H&SS
enced an Industrial Revolution and that all 
other countries simply followed in their 
steps, when that clearly isnt the case.
[The book] provides an opportunity to 
compare a country such as Russias Indus
trial Revolution to that of Germany. It also 
gives a sense of how China or Latin America 
began to participate in world economy, and 
how the United States and Europe were not 
the only powers.
Steams admits the book was easy for him 
to write, the process taking only a year,
because he was already famililar with 
Europes experience. It was a fun 
book to write. I had to find out what 
kinds of information I didnt know, 
and where I would find that informa
tion. I wanted to include real stories, 
such as personal experiences of work
ers in the factories, 
for the readers. 
Then I had to se
lect the most im
portant features, 
while pulling it all 
together into a co
herent whole, says 
Steams.
In writing this 
zjzzzzzzzzzzz=z book, Steams has 
discovered much 
about the writing process. Different 
books have different origins, he says. 
Somebody gets an interesting angle 
which springs from personal discov
eries the author has made, and you 
have a different, more exciting piece 
of writing.
Copies of Steam's book, The Indus
trial Revolution in World History, are 
available in the CMU bookstore and 
local libraries.
DG holds charity 
Anchor Clanker
By TONYA RADO
Assistant Features Editor
Whipped cream and water balloons soared through the air of Gesling 
Stadium yesterday afternoon as two-hundred people participated in Delta 
Gammas (DG) Anchor Clanker fall community service event. The festivities 
of this event are geared towards raising money to support the blind. That is 
one of the main purposes of Delta Gamma, said Kara Yamot, junior policy and 
management major and Games Chair of Anchor Clanker.
For the past three years, Delta Gamma has sponsored the Anchor Clanker 
and donated all of the proceedes to the Pittsburgh Blind Community. Each, 
year, DG selects and supports one of the following organizations: the Pitts-*
The Kappa Sig Pipelayers, Slg Tau Slicks, 
and the DTD Monkey Boys tied for fourth 
place. Sigma Nu and Theta Xi Fred tied for 
second place, and the winner of the 1993 ; 
Anchor Clanker event went to Phi Kap A. ;

burgh Blind School for Children, the Pittsburgh Blind Association, or the 
Pittsburgh Blind Guild. This year, DG raised $700 for the blind.
The 40 teams competing in the Anchor Clanker activities consisted of five 
representatives from each of the following organizations: Housing, Student; 
Affairs, the 14 fraternities, Delta Gamma, and two independent groups. Delta 
Gamma sported Anchor Clanker T-shirts, while Kappa Sig dressed in black 
wool suit jackets.
The games began at 11:30 am with obstacle courses, wheel barrel races, tug 
of war, water balloon tosses, potato sack races, and ended with Hannas 
Bullseye Free Throw in which all of the teams gathered around to throw gobs, 
of whipped cream at their favorite DGs. Each participant paid one dollar for! 
two shots. The DGs selected had to stand inside a sandwich board of a Raggedy * 
Ann doll and expose their face through the cut-out hole of the dolls head. One! 
DG sister that was bombed in the side of head said, Its great conditioner for! 
your hair. Hannas Bullseye Free Throw raised $80 alone for the blind. , i
Awards were also distributed. The Kappa Sig Pipelayers, SigTau Slicks, and! 
the DTD Monkey Boys tied for fourth place. Sigma Nu and Theta Xi Fred tiedfor second place, and the winner of the 1993 Anchor Clanker event went to Phi 
Kap A.
Many business organizations in the Pittsburgh area donated support and 
prizes for the winning teams. Giant Eagle donated all of the cases of whipped 
cream which was a big help, said Emanuel Lafer, Chair of Anchor Clanker. 
The Groovy Sponsors appeared on the backs of DGs Anchor Clanker Tshirts: Gateway Clipper Fleet, Mrs. Judy Miller, Miami Subs, Giant Eaglet, 
Cimini Hair, AC Coy Co., and D&D Service and Towing Inc. Phantom of the 
Attic was another major sponsor to Anchor Clanker. DGs community service 
event turned out to be another success.
Columnist trapped behind turtles
SLOW, from page L2
Heres a sample of thoughts from 
the people that were in front of me 
about a week and a half ago, which 
was my last half-decent day:
GUY #1: I just failed the Chem 
test.
GUY #2: I just broke up with my 
girlfirend.
GUY #3: Im just walking real slow 
so I could tick off the guy behind me. 
Needless to say, guy #3 accomplished 
his objective.
Now heres a conversation between 
three girls in front of me Thursday 
morning, when I was late for Physics 
recitation:
GIRL #1: I just met this great guy .
Hes so awesome!
GIRL #2: Oh, wow!
GIRL #3: Wait! Stop and look at 
this!
Today I had a bad day at ROTC and, 
of course, the people in Margaret 
Morrison computer cluster where Irfi 
typing this column all have smiles op 
their faces.
At least Ill have my revenge when J 
have another good day. Who needs the 
potato peeler?
Tom Harper, MCS freshman, is hav
ing another bad day today so yours 
will be really special.
Artists unite to complete CFA niches
CFA, from page LI
from CMUs Department of Ar
chitecture. Altogether, the teams 
aim was to preserve Hombostels 
intention while acknowledging 
the passage of seven decades and 
physical constraints such as di
mensions, geometry, and the im
movability of the existing stone.
Since
Hombostel drew _____________
his plans two-dimensionally on 
paper, the sculp
tors had to redraw 
them three dimensionally.
Hombostel based 
his drawings on 
specific architec
tural styles but 
used his imagina
tion in piecing 
them together.
Master
pictures they wanted and elec
tronically scanned them to pro
duce .plans.
Time posed the greatest chal
lenge. In the beginning, we ar
chitects were supposed to get the 
designs ready before the sculp
tors worked on them. However, 
they arrived just as we were about
As each piece becomes less com 
plex, it loses some of its original 
flavor.
 Nicholas Fairplay 
master carver
carver
Fairplay decided that it was bet
ter to leave CMU students with 
accurate depictions of various tra
ditional styles, so Hombostels 
plans were substituted for repli
cas of actual buildings. For ex
ample, the dome above the center 
niche copies the Panthenons. The 
team flipped through various 
books at Hunt Library to find the
to get started, said Bruce 
Lindsey. So the architects had to 
rush frantically to produce the 
designs. The sculptors were simi
larly frustrated with deadlines. 
They [the Administration] tell 
us that weve got to finish a pillar 
in three weeks. They do not allow 
for things such as finishings. One 
stone block could be harder than
another and obviously weve got 
to spend more time....
Because of stifling deadlines 
and a limited budget, the sculp
tors had to simplify many of their 
original designs. For example, it 
was originally planned that there 
be a Chinese dragon curled round 
a pillar supporting the World 
niche. Unfortu______________ nately, the
dragon had to go. 
As each piece 
becomes less 
complex, it loses 
some of its origi
nal flavor, said 
Fairplay.
For tools, the 
sculptors used 
the age-old ham
mer and chisel 
and the archiI tects, the com
puter. These 
tools seem to characterize the dif
ferent way both groups approach 
their work. Fairplay claims most 
of the drawings were done on 
paper but Lindsey says, Except 
the initial design, the computer 
did almost all the work. Some of 
the blocks were cut by computerguided laser saws before the de
tails were added by the sculptors.
Despite the power of the com
puter, some things were best done 
by hand. The computer is good 
for refinement and straight lines 
but cant handle details, says 
Lindsey.

Local filmmakers recreate Homestead Strike
y DAVID BAZELON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I The forces of the 19th century 
re capital and labor; united they 
Bansform the desert into a gar
den, in collision they convert the 
garden into a waste. This state
ment from the new documentary, 
The River Ran Red, depicts the 
tiirmoil brought about in the 
JSomestead Steel Strike of 1892, 
strike that has few written ac
counts of it in existence even 
though it is one of the most sig
nificant in Pennsylvanias his$jry.
^Accompanied with a menagerie
of different newspaper clippings 
and photographs from the era, 
The River Ran Red presents its 
information with a secure grip on 
the occurrences that took place. 
Each picture tells a story of its 
own and allows the viewer some 
true insight into the relationship 
between the capitalist and the 
workers he employs. The River 
Ran Red stresses the importance 
of good labor relations and ex
plores the consequences of it be
ing ignored.
The producers of the film, Nicole 
Fauteaux and Steffi Domike, hope 
that the film will not only serve 
as a historical documentation of
events but that it will also pro
vides for an understanding of 
modem problems within busi
nesses. Fauteaux said about the 
film, We want to make issues 
relevant to today ... to provoke 
discussion. Domike said, The 
Homestead strike exemplifies the
many of Andrew Carnegies other 
work forces. After repeated at
tempts to disband the union, 
Carnegie gave temporary control 
of the mill to Henry Clay Frick 
who immediately set out to for
tify it against unionized workers. 
The entire work force lost their
patrols to keep any non-union 
workers from being imported into 
the mill.
At this point, tensions were 
building, and Frick felt that he 
would have to take the mill by 
force. He sent in 300 men from 
the Pinkerton Detective Agency
Fauteaux and Domike found 
trouble locating information for 
the documentarys content. As
sisted by Rhonda Struminger, a 
current fifth year scholar at CMU, 
and one of the primary research
ers for this film, the filmmakers 
searched for any recollections of
historic clash between what a con- jobs by either being locked out of by boat, to which the people of the strike that they could obtain
stitutional democracy means 
property ownership versus the 
popular right to have some 
amount of say in the workplace. 
As the documentary explains, 
the work force of Homestead re
mained unionized under the 
Amalgamated Association of Iron 
and Steel Workers longer than
the mill or walking out intention- Homestead responded in revolt, 
ally due to knowledge of Fricks The battle ended in victory for 
plan to deunionize the mill. Frick the people of Homestead with at 
set up an employment station least 10 casualties collectively rewhere the people of Homestead suiting from the feud. Only days 
could apply for jobs, but only with- later, Frick convinced the goverout union contracts. Not only did nor to send in the state militia 
the people keep from applying for and finally gained control of the 
any positions, they set up citizen mill.
Local volunteers from the Pittsburgh area re-enacted the moments leading up to battle.
Domike and Fauteaux used many etchings, watercolors, and photographs to help tell 
their films story, such as this one depicting Pinkerton guard barges set on fire.
from the retired members of the 
United Steel Workers of America 
Pensioners Association.
In addition, they used various 
news articles and sketches pub
lished at the time of the battle. 
Neither of these resources proved 
to contain terribly extensive ac
counts, and the two producers 
found themselves talking to 
as many people that were 
related to the incident as pos
sible.
The documentary also ben
efits from a well-paced 
soundtrack. Many folk songs 
which were popular at the 
time of the strike add to the 
rich narration by B1 air Brown, 
who is perhaps best known 
for her starring role in The 
Days and Nights of Molly 
Dodd. There are a few people 
associated with The River Ran 
Red who have been members 
of the CMU community. In 
addition to Struminger, Paul 
Maya, a recent CMU gradu
ate, and co-producer of the 
recently finished documentary 
Requin was a production in
tern for this film. Professors 
David Demarest (English) and 
Eugene Levy (history), who 1wttb others Published a book
with the same title, also served 
as advisors.
Superpatriot reveals heros origins
Image Comics has struck 
again. Theyve managed to pub
lish a book with great art, great 
plot, and a big name creator. 
Even better, no gimmick cov
ers. After two issues (only $1.95 
for each, I might add) Erik 
Larsens Superpatriot has be
come one of my favorite Image 
r books. If you hadnt noticed, I 
really like the fact that both 
issues have been a standard 
price. I still have to be skepti
cal, though, because I felt the 
ksame way after three issues of 
fc Storm-watch and-then Bam! a 
;$2.50 bagged #0 with a trading 
card, so I wont get too excited 
yet.
Although Superpatriot bears 
f. resemblance to Marvels 
tDeathlok, he is a pretty unique 
character. Im really glad that

By Jason Andracki
about Superpatriots origin, un
like WildC.A.T.S andCyberforce, 
where they just jump right into 
the current story. So far, his ori
gin is pretty interesting. How
ever, I began to wonder during 
the flashback scene when they 
showed the 70s hippie Superpa
triot. Have you been smoking 
too much marijuana? asks one of 
Superpatriots teammates, 
Battletank. Maybe to keep up 
with current events, Erik Larsen 
and Keith Giffen will make the
gay.
It was nice to see how the art
work changed according to the 
time period. During the World 
War II flashback the artwork was 
so Jack Kirby-esque I thought Id 
picked up an old issue of Captain 
America or The Avengers. What 
Id guessed to be the 80s scene 
had a shadowy Frank Miller feel 
to it, especially the window crash
ing scene. Another reason I like 
Superpatriot so much is due to 
the villains, the Covenant of the 
Sword. Im almost tempted to like 
them because of how they cruci
fied (literally) the Ku Klux Klan. 
And hey, what a cool logo. I cant 
wait to find out more about them.
Something Im not sure 
whether I like or not, but thats 
nonetheless unique, is the ap
pearance of the present-day Su
perpatriot on only nine out of 24 
pages in issue two. Kinda strange, 
since the series is named after 
him.
Now, for the complaints. 
Actually, there is only one 
this week. It only took me 
approximately 15 minutes 
each to read these two isPerpatriot hangs in suspended animation, waiting to be

sues. I like something with a 
few more words than BDUMM 
BDUMM, and SKROOM on 
page after page of fight scenes. 
Im not asking for Sandman, 
but I would have liked a little 
more thought put into the book. 
Which makes me wonder why 
Image hasnt produced a line of 
comics similar to Marvels Epic 
and DCs Vertigo titles. I know 
theres Darker Image, but I 
want something a little more 
mature-reader oriented. I like 
the idea of an Image line for 
more mature audiences a lot, 
because right now, Vertigo has 
some of my favorite comics but 
Image has the best packaging 
of books (as long as they avoid 
gimmick covers) in the indus
try today. A new Image line 
could bring the best of both 
comic book worlds together.
Now I will leave you with two 
questions that I hope someone 
will answer for me. One, who is 
this Sentinel guy in issue two 
that looks like the High Evolu
tionary without the helmet? 
And number two, what is the 
Superpatriots 
link to the Sav
age Dragon, 
and why does 
he keep seeing

fights? Please 
help me, Im in 
suspense.

Put a lid on Lynchs 
new Boxing Helena
Boxing Helena
*
Directed by Jennifer Lynch. A 
doctor keeps a woman he de
sires near him by amputating 
her limbs. Stars Sharilyn Fenn 
and Julian Sands.
By KATHY WRIGHT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A couple of friends asked me to 
see Boxing Helena with them 
last Sunday night. I was appre
hensive about seeing this par
ticular psychotic thriller because 
it was rumored to be based on 
truth about a man disfiguring a 
woman with whom he is obsessed 
with and keeps her captive in a 
box.
Psycho-thriller it is not. Based 
on truth? I think not! In fact, the 
movie, written and directed by 
Jennifer Chambers Lynch, has 
nothing to do with a box or any of 
the rumored violence.
Instead, Lynch, daughter of 
Twin Peaks creator and bizzare 
filmmaker David Lynch, devotes 
about two-thirds of the movie to 
multiple scenes of explicit sex and 
voluptuous women parading 
around in lingerie.
Women are simply depicted as 
the erotic sexual fantasies of men 
in this movie. Some may inter
pret this flick to be a visual dis
play of Lynchs deep seated de
sires, but for those who know her
realize that she is serious about 
her work and are aware of her 
taste for the bizarre, so there cer
tainly must be more here than 
meets the eye. As the saying goes, 
Like father, like daughter....
Sherilyn Fenn stars as Helena 
who is pursued by a surgeon, 
played by Julian Sands. To the 
sick fortune of the good doctor, 
Helena is run over by a car in 
front of his isolated country home. 
He saves her by amputating 
her legs, reducing her to the ele
ments of his lust  her face, 
breasts, butt.
Under normal circumstances, 
you would feel sorry for Helena, 
the victim, but in this case, she is 
a bitch so that makes it difficult 
for audience sympathy to come 
into play here. Helena becomes 
the object of ihe doctors posses
sion because she cannot move. 
He actually doesnt do anything 
further to her physically except 
place her on a shrine. Boring, 
huh?
At this point in the complete 
underdevelopment of the story, I 
could only ponder how they 
worked things out in the bathPlease see BOXING, page L10

New release from The Samples, on 
W.A.R.? label. The Samples will 
perform an all-ages show at 
Metropol on Tuesday, September 
28 at 9 pm.
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Ok, I had never heard of The 
Samples before. I reviewed them 
because the CD case looked 
unique. The album I received is 
called The Last Drag, and I am
pleased to announce, is very good.
A blend of REM, Neil Young 
(and a little Sting, said my room
mate), the band has their own 
style deeply rooted in folk and 
country. Started in 1987, they 
released their first album on a 
major label in 1989. They then 
worked with W.A.R.? records, an 
upstart company run by a former 
A&R man. Even with their con
voluted roots, The Samples sure 
are interesting.
The lead singer sounds like a 
less whiny Neil Young. The band 
uses mostly guitar layered with

organs and pianos to produce a surprisingly fall 
: sound, especially for such a nearly independent 
production.
The lyrics are simple (Remember the beach?/ 
 Remember the cold, cold sea/That washed over us,/ 
' and washed over you and me), and the melodies are 
1 pleasing and at some times strong and extremely 
' likable.
The Samples are a band that doesnt require a lot 
of thought, which is nice.
The albums mood moves from a disturbed coun
try jaunt in Little Silver Ring to a brooding tribal 
repetition in The Last Drag, a song with a heavy 
1 backbeat supplied by drummer Jeep MacNichol. 
' Andy Sheldon on bass fleshes out many of the 
'songs, such as the slow Still Water, and Al 
" Laughlin on keyboards adds a detailed background 
accompaniment, be it a piano peeking out from 
' under the guitars and drums or a cheery melody in 
Darkside.

Touch of Evil
Orson Welles directed (and, of course, also 
starred in) this 1958 film about a narcotics 
officer and a corrupt cop who cross paths during 
a murder investigation in a sleazy Mexican 
border town. The object of their struggle is the 
narcs wife, played by Janet Leigh.
This film was beautifully shot and includes a 
Latin music score by soundtrack-meister Henry 
Mancini.
Also stars Charlton Heston, Marlene Deitrich, 
and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
If youve got a dollar and some extra time 
Thursday night, use it to go see this Welles 
masterpiece.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, September 24
Barbarella
Jane Fonda bares all (well, almost all) in this 
1968 film based on the popular French comic 
strip about a sexy 41st-century space adventur
ess. Fonda plays this sexy queen of the galaxy, 
as various male space creatures on a strange 
planet drool over her.
And, Duran Duran fans, if youve ever won
dered where their name came from, this movie 
is it. They named themselves after one of the 
main characters, played by Milo OShea.
Make sure you dont come in late and miss 
Fondas striptease during the opening credits. 
This is objectification at its historical climax 
here. Probably worth the buck if youve got the 
time.

Indecent Proposal
Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson star as a 
young couple who try their luck gambling in Las 
Vegas. In the hotel dress shop, Moore catches 
the eye of a billionaire played by Robert Redford. 
Taken by Moores beauty and challenged by her 
spunk, Redford invites both her and her hus
band to his penthouse after befriending them in 
the casino. Redford offers Harrelson a million 
dollars for a night with his wife. Appalled at 
first by his proposal, the couple refuses Redfords 
offer, but after further contemplation, they 
agree to do it out of desperation for money. On 
the night of the date, Harrelson regrets their 
decision and is consumed with jealousy that 
later taints his relationship with Moore and 
changes the entire course of the movie.
While the plot of this film is strikingly similar 
to that of Honeymoon in Vegas, it takes a more 
serious tone. For the soft-hearted, this movie 
will continueously tug at your emotions. For the 
tough-hearted, on the other hand, just think of 
gawking at Moore, Harrelson, and Redford for a 
couple hours. That should be enough to get you 
to go. All those pretty faces in one movie.. .thats 
more bang for the buck!

Frankie Avalon! Annette Funicello! Bikinis!

time for plot when theres so much beach party
ing fun to be had?
Frankie goes out on a limb here, playing a
