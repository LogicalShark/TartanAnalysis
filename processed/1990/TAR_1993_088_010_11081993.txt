President vetoes GSOpecision comes after Chair of Senate

"artan News Editor
On Friday evening, Student Government Presijent David Wolpert announced on the bulletin 
oard assocs.student-senate thathe exerisedhis 
eto option on proposal F93-5, the GSO Activies Fee resolution, passed in Student Senate 
uesday night by a vote ofl4-13. BurtHolzman, 
j,air of Senate, 
ast an affirmave vote to break
13-13 tie.
According to 
enates bylaws, 
itudent Senate 
iay... override a 
esidential veto 
iy a two-thirds 
ote at the next 
egular Senate 
aeeting following 
he Chairs readng of the veto.
The resolution 
vould raise the 
amount of money 
riven to GSO from 
17 percent to 60 
lercentwithinthe 
lext two years.
The percent change was calculated from the 
amount of graduate participation in Senatefunded activities. Student Senate tabled the reso
lution on Tuesday, October 26, after the resolu
tion was reconsidered.
I find myself in the position of having to make 
the first tough decision of my presidency, Wolpert 
in his announcement. I still believe the 
resolution is great, but the process was so poorly 
handled and the ramifications of the resolution 
too great for me not to veto it.
Accordingto Wolperts announcement, the reso
lution that passed through Student Senate would 
not have passed if it wasnt for the vote of five 
graduate students who filled vacant seats in 
Student Senate. In addition, Wolpert said that 
he felt although Holzman did not violate any 
rules, he violated the spirit of them.
According to Roberts Rules of Order, which 
Senate uses to run its meetings, the chair can 
cast a vote either to tie or to break a tie. Holzman
did not comment on his reasons for breaking the 
tie.
Wolpert said that the group of students that 
drafted the resolution pushed and pushed Sen
ate because they felt the split was right. He 
said, In politics, its occasionally appropriate to 
let ones personal beliefs outweigh their con
stituents desires, but not when the only real 
support is coming from the same group that 
came up with the idea in the first place.
I felt it was necessary to veto the resolution to 
preserve the integrity of Student Senate, said
resolutionbreaks 13-13 tie
Wolpert. The issue is dead in Senate at least for 
now, but it could come up again as part of a larger 
resolution to restructure Student Government. 
Holzman said that he agreed with the 
presidents decision to veto F93-5. I had a feel
ing that we may need more time to develop a new 
resolution, said Holzman. He said he still sup
ports the GSO Activities Fee split, but the reso
lution should be proposed as part of a restruc
turing resolution and 
without impending dead
lines for the Board of 
Trustees.
Lara Wolfson, GSO 
president, was disap
pointed in Wolperts deci
sion. She said in a post, 
What I see in [Wolperts] 
actions is the continued 
sub-jectification of gradu
ate student interests to un
dergraduate student inter
ests. Despite the fact that 
this legislation has passed 
twice, the wants of under
grads must come first! 
Wolfson also said that 
she doubts the ability of 
Student Senate to allow 
for a formal restructuring 
of Student Government to 
allow GSO to be the governing body of graduate 
students.
At GSOs monthly meeting on Wednesday, GSO 
voted 29-02 in favor of the resolution. Histori
cally, Student Senate has not represented gradu
ate students interests, Wolfson said. The un
dergraduates that fill Senates seats dont ad
dress graduate issues.
Before last Tuesdays meeting, a five-question 
informal survey was circulated to all graduate 
departments by GSO, asking them if they thought

Reorientation 
sets goals of 
class success
By JESSICA FANG
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Reorientation for this academic year is scheduled 
for Sunday, January 16,1994, from 12 pm to 6 pm. 
Reorientation will be similar to Freshmen Orienta
tion, but the goal of the program is to promote 
academic and personal success.
All freshmen and transfer students, as well as 
students who are changing majors, will be receiving 
invitations in the mail.
Colleen Sherman, a junior psychology major, is 
working on the new and improved reorientation 
with Becca Albrecht, a sophomore English major, 
and Apartments Area Coordinator Karen Lipton. 
Sherman says that they are very excited about the 
new program.
Surveys were conducted in front of Doherty Hall 
about three weeks ago in order to get an idea of how 
the program could be improved.
In response, the program is being geared towards 
what students want. There are more interesting 
and exciting new workshops with catchy titles such 
as Working hard, getting nowhere, and How to 
have a balanced and diverse life.
Working hard, getting nowhere is about effec
tive time management and how to combat procras
tination. The second covers fitness, nutrition, sports, 
social activities, and almost all other aspects of 
college life.
Students will be able to attend four workshops, 
each one hour long. The six-hour program will kick 
off with lunch and end with dinner, with an activity 
between.
This will be the second year of winter reorienta
tion. Last year, over 40 freshmen participated in 
Reorientation, although over 100 freshmen regis
tered for the program.
Engineers sweep Detroit awards
'CMU MechEs win six trophies at competition
By JASON TOGYER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
For the second year in a row, 
the Carnegie Mellon chapter of 
the Society of Automotive Engi
neers (SAE) has swept the awards 
at the annual SAE Micro Baja 
Competition in Detroit.
The event was sponsored by 
the Detroit chapter of SAE and 
by corporate sponsors, including 
Ford Motor Company and Gen
eral Motors.
The contest is open to both uni
versity and corporate teams. Each 
team enters one or more selfpropelled remote-controlled cars, 
which are then required to navi
gate a race course. The CMU 
chapter entered three cars.
There are two classes for cars, 
stock and unlimited. The specifi:ations for stock cars are much 
more restrictive than those for 
unlimited cars.
Awards are given for such catJgories as best overall winner, 
Jest performance (stock and unimited), best design (stock and 
unlimited), and truck pulling ca
pacity.
The CMU chapter took all of 
the awards, a total of six alto
gether.
In addition, six plaques are 
given for the first, second, and 
third place cars in both classes, 
and the CMU entries clinched 
first and second place in the un
limited class as well as first place 
in the stock class.
Participants from CMU in
cluded team co-captains sopho
more John Black, sophomore 
Chris Heiser, and junior Eric 
Meyhofer, all mechanical engi
neering majors.
Mike Boyer, a junior mechani
cal engineering major and past 
president of the CMU chapter of 
SAE, says hes pretty proud of a 
dedicated bunch of guys.
Last year I had a great deal of 
faith in them, said Boyer, and 
this year they took an entirely 
different car with them and swept 
all the awards again.
Boyer said that the CMU chap
ter won every award except one 
given to corporate entrants. Ford 
Motor Company took that one,
said Boyer.
There was one other award, 
and if we had gotten this one, we 
would have won them all, said 
Boyer. We challenged Ford Mo
tor Company  our trophy 
against their corporate trophy.
Before the end ofthe corporate 
races, we gave an open challenge 
over the PA system to the winner 
ofthe corporate competition, said 
Heiser, a sophomore mechanical 
engineering major.
This turned out to be Ford, 
and the Ford car builder said, 
Beat my time,  said Heiser.
It was a real treat to see the 
entire Ford teams mouths drop 
open as they watched our car tear 
up the course, said Heiser.
Unfortunately, he said, the 
CMU cars battery ran out 30 feet 
from the finish line.
We came this close, Heiser 
said. We clearly would have 
beaten his time and set a new 
course record. I would have loved 
to hear the explanation when they 
got back and tried to explain to 
their colleagues how three kids 
from CMU beat them in Detroit.

The CMU Psychology Department has devel
oped a computerized intelligent tutoring system 
that will assist students in math by solving math
ematical problems the way a student does. The 
program has been tested in Pittsburghs Langley 
High School and has received excellent reviews.
The head researcher, John Anderson, professor 
of psychology and computer science, designed the 
program so it would help students learn to solve 
math problems. According to Anderson, the com
puter knows where the student is in the problem 
solving process and will interact with the student 
to help him/her on the problem. We use this 
cognitive model to interpret the. students problem 
solving behavior, said Anderson.
Anderson came up with the idea 10 years ago. 
Since then, CMU has been working and developing 
tutorial programs, but the plan has only now be
come economically feasible.
In 1986, a computer geometry tutor was de
signed and two years later the intelligent tutoring 
system was brought to the public schools. Accord
ing to Anderson, he entered into the relationship 
with the Pittsburgh public school system to help 
revise the high school mathematics curriculum to 
one that is more modem.
In order to put the program through a real test, 
Anderson brought his project to Langley High 
School where it got its first use in a classroom 
setting. In all, 14 classes, including geometry and 
algebra, used the software on Macintosh Ilsi com
puters. The experiment was enormously success
ful as many students grades increased.
The class was designed a different way with the 
intelligent tutor system. First, the teacher gave 
the instructions followed by students being led by 
the program through a labyrinth of algebraic prob
lems that got more difficult as they went along. The 
program monitored the student and was able to 
detect their strengths and weaknesses while giv-: 
ing hints where necessary.
The latest form of this program is less expensive 
and more mobile than earlier versions. The pro-' 
gram ofthe early 80s was run on $50,000 Xerox 
workstations, which were designed for artificial 
intelligence research. Because personal computers 
have advanced so much since then, now a Macintosh; 
Ilsi is all the program requires.
The intelligent tutor system doesnt stop there. 
Right now, researchers are planning two summer 
programs that will use the tutor. From that, a 
program will be developed to assist at-risk math 
students. Soon, the intelligent tutor system will be 
made available to schools in other cities across the 
country.

Clinton discusses issues on public-affairs program
WASHINGTON, November 7 (AP)
 President Bill Clinton today be
came the first sitting president to ap
pear on NBC-TVs Meet the Press since 
Jimmy Carter in 1980.
Clinton addressed a number of top
ics on the long-running Sunday morn
ing public affairs program, including 
relations with Congress, health care, 
and foreign policy.
He says he absolutely expects Con
gress to enact health reform legisla
tion next year.
The President concedes he may have 
lost some credibility because of confu
sion over how many Americans will 
have to pay more for health care. But 
he says were the only people who 
have a plan.
Clinton says 70 percent of Ameri
cans will pay the same or less for the 
same or better benefits. He says the 
numbers were confusing at first be
cause no one took into account the fact 
that some people with health insur
ance have very high deductibles and 
pay more out of pocket.
He says people with very limited 
benefits and young, single people will 
pay more. But he says itll be worth it, 
because theyll never lose their insur
ance.
During a discussion on foriegn policy, 
Clinton warned North Korea against 
building a nuclear bomb.
He told the moderators that America 
must be very firm in its opposition. He 
would not discuss the possibility of a 
pre-emptive strike to destroy North 
Koreas nuclear facilities. But he says 
any conventional attack against South
Korea would be considered an attack 
on the United States as well.
The President also spoke of strength
ening the embargo against Haiti and 
possiblymakingittotal. He discounted 
a campaign to discredit exiled Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as 
mentally unstable.
He declined direct comment of Rus
sian President Boris Yeltsins decision 
to skip presidential elections next year 
in favor of serving out his term. He 
says that the U.S. will support Yeltsin 
as long as Russia continues to reform.
Clinton says he will take on orga
nized labor, saying that its the biggest 
obstacle to winning passage of the 
North American Free Trade Agree
ment (NAFTA).
He accused labor of resorting to 
roughshod, musclebound tactics to 
pressure Democrats in the House to 
vote against the pact. Clinton says he 
doesnt yet have the votes to pass the 
NAFTA, but I think well make it. 
The House votes on the pact Novem
ber 17.
He says hes confident Vice Presi
dent A1 Gore will make a clear case for 
the treaty when he debates Ross Perot 
Tuesday night.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R., Kan.) say s hell support Clinton on 
the NAFTA. Dole told CBS-TVs Face 
the Nation that a defeat would be 
damaging to the country and to the 
President.
However, Dole predicts Congress 
wont pass the Presidents health care 
package. He said it needs drastic sur
gery between now and next year.
Yeltsin opposes elections; experts say future unclear
WASHINGTON, November 7 (AP)
 Experts say Russian President 
Boris Yeltsins doubts about keeping a 
promise to hold presidential elections 
next year are no great surprise.
However, analysts here and in the 
troubled republic say they dont know 
what to expect next.
Yeltsin reportedly told Russian 
newspaper editors yesterday that he 
opposes an early presidential vote now 
scheduled for June.
The Russian president says he wants 
to serve out his full term, until 1996, 
and train someone to run as his sucYeltsin promised the early presi
dential election this fall when he dis
banded the hard-line Russian parlia
ment and scheduled parliamentary 
elections for next month.
Georgetown University government 
professor Angela Stent says Yeltsins 
comments are no surprise.
She says he remains Russias most 
widely supported politician, with no 
obvious successor.
Stent says Russias political life at 
the moment is focused on the parlia
mentary elections, with parties orga
nizing frantically for an unprecedented 
popular vote.
Local publisher 
faces trial for 
smear campaign
PITTSBURGH, November 7 (AP)  
The attorney for multimillionaire Rich
ard Mellon Scaife says his client will go 
to trial against a woman who charged 
that Scaife engineered her firing be
cause she testified in his divorce case.
Margaret Kuhnemund of Ligonier sued 
Scaife in 1990 over her firing form the 
Sheraton Inn in Greensburg.
She say s Scaife waged a two-year cam
paign to get her fired after she appeared 
at a divorce hearing in 1987 on behalf of 
Scaifes ex-wife, Frances Scaife.
The lawsuit charges that Scaife, owner 
of the Greensburg-based Tribune-Review, refused to do business with or 
print publicity about the Sheraton until 
Kuhnemund was fired.
Scaifes attorney Yale Gutnick says 
hes ready for trial and that his client is 
not liable. The trial has been moved 
from Pittsburgh, where the suit was 
filed, to Greensburg, county seat of 
Westmore-land County.
Scaife, who lives in Pittsburgh, is 
ranked 112th on Forbes Magazine's list 
of the nations 400 wealthiest people. 
His fortune is estimated at $750 million.
Israeli, Syrian 
military in secret 
security talks
JERUSALEM, November 7 (AP)  
Theres word that senior Israeli mili
tary intelligence officials have been hold
ing secret talks with their Syrian coun
terparts.
Meanwhile, a faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) has 
claimed responsibility for todays attack 
on a right-wing rabbi in the occupied 
West Bank. The rabbi was wounded but 
not seriously hurt, but his driver was 
killed.
An official says the talks in Europe 
have focused on security arrangements 
in the Golan Heights. Israel is looking to 
balance such things as surveillance and 
demilitarization to how much territory 
it would return on the strategic plateau.
The official says no understanding 
has been reached, but the fact that talks 
have been held could be an important 
step towards Israeli-Syrian peace.
Official talks between Israel and Syria 
have stalled. Israel insists that Syria 
define its terms for peace before it agrees 
to withdraw from the Golan heights, 
which were captured during the 1967 
war.
Syria has long maintained that the 
extent of the withdrawal must be de
fined first.
The Democratic Front for the Libera
tion of Palestine issued a statement in 
Damascus, Syria, claiming responsibil
ity for the attack of Rabbi Haim 
Druchman. Druchman is a former legis
lator in the right-wing National Reli
gious Party.
An Israeli army spokesperson says a 
car of Arab gunmen passed Druchmans 
car near the West Bank town of Hebron 
and open fire this morning. The car was 
hit 20 times. The last fatal attack on an 
Israeli in the West Bank set off a week of 
settler riots.
Fire crews work 
to contain blaze 
in California
MALIBU, Calif., November 7 (AP)  
Fire crews are hoping to have most of a 
disastrous fire around Malibu, Califor
nia, contained today.
Officials say the fire is now more than 
80 percent containedmeaning a line of 
bare earth has been cut around the blaze.
The fire killed three people, destroyed 
or damaged more than 360 structures, 
most of them homes, and caused at least 
$170 million in damage.
Investigators are still hunting for the 
arsonist who set the fire.
Firefighters are dousing hot spots, 
clearing out brush, or waiting for dis
charge orders.
Yesterday, scores of residents lined up 
at Malibus newly opened emergency aid 
center to get federal assistance.City woman, 78, 
stabbed to death 
by grandson
PITTSBURGH, November 6 (AP)  
Police in Pittsburgh say a teen attempt
ing to rob his grandmother stabbed and 
killed her in her apartment.
Fifteen-year-old Antoine Rhodes, a 
ninth-grader at Pittsburghs South High 
School, was charged Saturday with ho
micide and armed robbery.
He pleaded innocent in Allegheny 
County Night Court and was jailed at 
Shuman Juvenile Detention Center.
Investigators say Martha Rhodes, 78, 
stumbled out of her apartment early 
today and into the arms of a neighbor. 
She died at the scene.
State attorney 
general calls for 
justices removal
PHILADELPHIA, November 7 (AP)
 The next move has to come from the 
state legislature, says Pennsylvania 
State Attorney General Ernie Preate.
Preates going after suspended Su
preme Court Justice Rolf Larsens job't
Preate says hell approach legislative 
leaders and ask for impeachment pr#. 
ceedings against Larsen. The reason 5 
a grand jury report that accuses Larsej 
of an assortment of misconduct charge; 
and ethical lapses.
The report, released Friday, doesnt 
accuse Larsen of any criminal wrong, 
doing.
The same grand jury, though, has already recommended that Larsen be 
charged with a variety of drug viola, 
tions.
Jurors charge Larsen obtained prj. 
scription drugs illegally while in offi^ 
He was charged last week on the drug 
counts.
Preate and special prosecutors say tle 
allegations against Larsen should cause 
Pennsylvanians to look closely at their 
highest court and ask whats wrong. 
They say thats the best path to sorely 
needed reform.
Among other things, Larsen is accused 
of fabricating charges against fellowjustices and improperly handling the flow 
of cases that came to the Supreme Court 
by keeping a list of favored attorneys.
Larsens attorney, William C. 
Costopolous, says Preate acted improp., 
erly by releasing a report full of charges 
that arent criminal.
Costopolous says the grand jury should 
indict or be quiet.
Pope denounces neo-Nazi racism 
in Europe
ROME, November7 (AP)Pope John 
Paul II says rising neo-Nazi violence in: 
Europe poses a cruel and dangerous 
threat.
The pope made the comments after a 
boy asked how the Roman Catholic 
Church views unrest among skinheads 
and other hate groups. He was visitinga 
church in an area of Rome thats known 
for anti-foreigner attitudes.
The pope urged all areas, especially 
working-class districts that attract im
migrants, to reject what he calls tie 
incredible ferocity of hate groups.
Swastikas and racial graffiti were 
scrawled on some buildings near the 
church the pope visited.
Anti-foreigner attacks have been on 
the rise in Italy, but not to the extent of 
attacks in Germany and other areas ofi 
Europe.

SG President invokes veto against 
Graduate Activities Fee resolution
VETO, from page 1
GSO supported the graduate students 
interests. Over 234 responses have been 
received so far.
The survey showed that 77 percent of 
graduate students in the survey thought 
GSO did support the graduate student 
interests, 84 percent felt that their voice 
was heard in GSO, and 85 percent sup
ported GSO controlling more the Gradu
ate Activities Fee.
Our survey shows that graduate stu
dents were unaware of Student Senate, 
Wolfson said, and they do feel GSO 
represents their interests.
Addressing the point that graduate 
students joined Student Senate to sway 
the vote, Wolfson said that GSO raised 
graduates awareness of Senates claim 
of graduate interest.
Many graduate students did not know 
about the vacancies, said Wolfson. Sen
ate never advertised GSIA seats. The 
four GSIA Senators plan to stay on Sen
ate. Senate has done a poor job with 
advertising vacancies.... We did Senates 
job for them.
CFA Senator Jim Albert, chair of the 
Public Relations committee, voted 
against the resolution and was working 
on completing a restraining petition 
against F93-5 before Wolperts veto. I 
didnt think it was right to segment off 
the campus, Albert said. All students 
should chip in to the whole.
According to Student Senates bylaws, 
a restraining petition must have the 
signatures, printed names, and phone 
numbers of 1,500 members of the Stu
dent Body.
The petition had to be submitted to 
Student Senates Executive Committee 
within 10 school days of passage of the 
legislation being considered.
Albert said that he drafted the peti
tion Wednesday afternoon with some of 
his CFA constituents. This [split] was 
being forced upon a significant portion 
of the campus, he said.
Albert also said that he was glad to see 
that Woipert realized the opposition to 
the resolution. He said, Im glad to see 
that although [Wolpertl has been in fa
vor of this, he has been rather impar
tial.
SCS Senator Arik Cohen voted in fa
vor of the resolution. I felt that as a 
member of the Funding & Recognition 
Committee [F&R], said Cohen, I felt 
my students should get their $100 worth. 
Graduate students would receive more 
benefits. Lots of undergraduates were 
opposed, but after explaining to them 
the reasoning behind it, they felt is was 
unfair for us to be spendingtheir money. 
Cohen also said that it is the presidents 
right to veto legislation. It was a close 
enough vote in Senate that basically the 
President would have had the final say, 
said Cohen.
Erik Altmann, a doctoral student in 
computer science, protested against the 
resolution and supported the presidents 
veto. It was the only reasonable thing to 
do, said Altmann.
Before the veto, Altmann said that the 
decision of Student Senate cannot 
stand. He said, I could respect the 
decision, even if disagreed with it, if the 
body discussed it rationally... But no one 
could respect this decision.
No one thought about the impact that 
$50,000 is going to have, Altmann said. 
No ones talked where it will come from. 
I am sure the money will pay for food and 
drink, and the difference will come from
Correction...
either your pocket or from organiza
tions budgets.
Wolfson said that before this resolu
tion, $80,000 went to GSO, and Student 
Senate was left with $570,000. If the 
resolution passes, according to Wolfson, 
Senate will have $520,000 [in the next 
two years].
However, Wolfson said, $477,000 
goes to organizations budgets. No group 
budgets have to be cut just Senates 
ability to make loans.
David Martin, a senior psychology 
major, resigned as Student Government 
Treasurer because of the arguments he 
heard at the Student Senate meeting 
when F93-5 was reconsidered and 
tabled. I was listening to [Altmanns] 
performance, and he made the point 
that even [President Bill] Clinton has a 
plan with what hes going to do with 
money distribution, said Martin. He 
said Senators should be asking the F&R 
chair and the treasurer about this. 
When I sat there and realized the 
errors we [Senate] had made, I felt like 
an idiot, said Martin. I felt like I had 
failed the student body because I didnt 
come up with these things.
My worry is that [Wolfson] will hop
scotch over Senate and go to the admin
istration, said Altmann. People need 
to make sure [Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael] Murphy and other administra
tors know that the reason why this [reso
lution] was rejected was because there is 
no basis for it.
In last weeks story, GSIA motivates fourth grade students to stay in 
school, the acronym for GSIAs I Had a Dream program was misstated. 
The program is known as IHAD.

Locks in Morewood Gardens 
rekeyed due to lost master
Because of the loss of a master key, all of the locks in Morewood 
Gardens need to be changed, according to Dave Potter, assistant 
director of Housing for facilities. What I can tell you is that were 
rekeying Morewood because a master key was lost by member of the 
housekeeping staff, said Potter.
Master keys are kept by the housing office, campus police, main
tenance, and housekeeping, said Potter. He said he couldnt say for 
sure how many master keys there were.
Potter said that there were approximately 750 people living in 
Morewood, but that the total number of locks was less than that. The 
rekeying started last week and is to last until tomorrow.
Potter said that he knows of no security breaches caused by the 
master keys loss, but that the Housing Office wanted to make sure 
that safety was not compromised in any way.
Robotics Institute, Shadyside 
Hospital join to create 
medical robotic center
Recent advances in medical diagnostics have made anatomical 
information  on tumor location, for example  so precise that 
robotic assistance for surgeons is fast becoming a reality, according 
to Takeo Kanade, director of Carnegie Mellons Robotics Institute.
The institute and Shadyside Hospital, one of five hospitals in the 
United States that will soon have a robotic assistant to enhance 
surgical precision, have joined to create a Center for Medical Robot
ics and Computer-Assisted Surgery.
Kanade belives the institutes expertise in scheduling, simulation, 
and manipulation can help hospitals cut costs and maximize use of 
available technology.
To that end, institute researchers are developing techniques to 
give surgeons a three-dimensional view of laparoscopic surgical sites 
and a three-dimensional, computerized anatomy book allowing 
medical trainees to simulate surgery before the actual procedure.

FORUM
New senators must 
futili all responsibilities
Last week, we saw something 
that we would never have ex
pected. The vacant seats on Stu
dent Senate were filled by gradu
ate students, four of whom were 
from GSIA and one of whom 
was from the Heinz school. 
These seats have been vacant 
all year, and we are pleased to 
see that these graduate students 
have decided that it was now 
time that their voices were heard 
and that they personally would 
make up for the lack of graduate 
student participation on Sen
ate.
However, this also leaves us 
perplexed and concerned. First, 
we are not sure why it took so 
long for these new senators to 
get interested. Why wait until 
the end of the year to get in
volved? Did their work load 
lessen? Have the scales fallen 
from their eyes so that they now 
see that they can make a differ
ence? Second, the only reason 
we can see for their joining at 
thist time is that they wanted to 
pass the Activities Fee resolu
tion.
We by no means want to imply 
duplicity in the hearts of the 
new senators, but looking at the 
resolution makes us wonder. 
The resolution would give GSO 
a 60 percent split of graduate 
student activities fees, whereas, 
before, they only had 37 per
cent. Did these new senators 
join Student Senate just to push 
this one issue through? We hope 
not.
Something similar happened 
in the Spring of 1992. When 
Student Senate intended to pass 
the so-called ROTC resolution, 
which denounced the discriminatory policies of ROTC and the 
Department of Defense, and 
called for the removal of the 
ROTC program from Carnegie 
Mellons academic community. 
Because of this resolution, many 
ROTC members and supporters 
filled the vacant seats in an at
tempt to defeat the resolution. 
Although their attempt to halt 
the passage of the resolution 
failed, several of these apparent 
one-issue senators went on to 
fulfill their obligations to Stu
dent Government. Alas, some 
left, having gotten what they 
desired, they broke their prom
ises and didnt keep their word. 
Though it might be considered 
questionable to'join senate over 
just one issue, we applaud those 
who did and stayed to complete 
their terms  and hope that 
newest members of senate will 
follow their example.
Initially, with the influx of the 
five new graduate student sena
tors, the resolution passed. Some 
considered joining Senate for 
one issue unethical, and others, 
such as David Wolpert, student 
body president, considered it 
plain old bad politicking.
That, however, is not the ques
tion, especially nowthatWolpert 
has vetoed the resolution. GSO 
now needs to get Student Sen
ate to accept the resolution with 
a two-thirds vote to override 
the veto.
We hope that whether the reso
lution passes or not, these new 
senators will stay on and fulfill 
their termsthus showing that 
they are willing to be involved 
in all aspects of student life and 
not just those aspects that will 
bring them personal benefit.
Caller ID threatens 
promise of anonymity
From the beginning of our 
years here at CMU, all the way 
through our graduation however 
many years later, we students 
are encouraged to contact the 
Office of Student Affairs when 
we are suffering personal prob
lems.
Such problems, due to 
workload, classes, campus life, 
and plain old stress, can be over
whelming at times.Its good that 
Student Affairs offers its assis
tance to students.
In many cases, students suf
fer problems which they do not 
want made public knowledge, 
and so contact Student Affairs 
hoping to take advantage of the 
pledge of confidentiality that the 
office offers in advance. But is 
this pledge truly being kept to 
the utmost of Student Affairs 
ability? With the institution of 
the new, revamped phone sys
tem, many campus offices are 
now equipped with a caller iden
tification system.
It was recently brought to our 
attention that the Office of Stu
dent Affairs is one ofthem. How, 
then, can students hoping to 
remain anonymous or to keep 
their problems confidential hope 
to contact Student Affairs and 
take full advantage of its ser
vices?
What happens to students who
call the office and, expecting to 
be asked for their phone num
ber, are informed that the per
son answering the phone al
ready knows it, courtesy of the 
miracle of caller ID? Our guess 
is thats the last time 
that student contacts Student 
Affairs when suffering a prob
lem.
However, this problem seems 
easy enough to solve. There are 
two options, neither of which 
should take very much effort at 
all. Student Affairs can either 
deactivate all caller ID systems 
in the office, thereby preserving 
the anonymity of all callers, or 
can add a new, special phone 
line, dedicated specifically to 
confidential incoming calls.A 
little advertising through Hous
ing, SDC, and Student Senate 
would make it easy to spread 
awareness of such a new num
ber.
Its too bad that Student Af
fairs got caught up in the Uni
versity-wide fascination with 
the new bells and whistles available with the new phone 
system.But theres just no ex
cuse for that office to use caller 
ID  it violates promises and 
misleads students.However, the 
problem should be extremely 
easy to fix. We hope that it will 
be soon.
Letters to the Editor
Senate stacked for 
GSO vote
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Last Tuesday, the 
Graduate Student Or
ganization appeared 
before Student Senate, 
again. They cajoled and 
wheedled until they got what they 
wanted: 60 percent of the Activities Fee 
paid by graduate students, $50,000 per 
year, to spend as they like.
They had to stack Student Senate to 
do it. They recruited four MBAs and one 
other warm body to fill vacant seats. 
One of these even spoke during debate. 
She said, Its our money. We want it. 
Give it to us.
They had help from a sympathetic 
Senate chair. He dispensed with normal 
procedure, seating the ringers without 
approval by the body.
He maneuvered the agenda to make 
sure they could vote on their issue. Fi
nally, when the allocation would have 
failed on a tie, he cast the deciding vote 
in favor.
Grads should be worried. As GSO pulls 
them out of the tax base, the 30 or 40 
organizations funded by taxes will ask 
whether they can afford to treat grads as 
first-class citizens, and whether they 
even want to, given GSOs attitude. The 
climate for future grads will chill; Stu
dent Government, WRCT, the Student 
Union, and the Women's Center might 
not have been as open to me, had this 
coup happened several years ago.
Where will the money go? GSO isnt 
saying. But half of GSOs current budget 
goes to lounge parties and ski trips. The 
other half pays salaries for GSO officers, 
so they can cash in on their community 
service; sends grads on conference jun
kets; funds exclusive programs for mi
norities and women; and delivers Focus, 
a newsletter covering faculty and staff 
issues, written mostly by undergradu
ates for a class project, with one column 
reserved for grad authors, to every grad 
mailbox on campus.
Where will the money come from? 
Student Senate isnt saying, having stub
bornly dodged the question. But budget 
cuts, a fee hike, or both, seem the only 
choices.
Maybe Senate will sense the mount
ing anger, and vote to rescind.
Maybe the restraining petition now 
circulating will help. If all else fails, 
maybe the Trustees will sense the ambi
guity, and simply ignore the whole thing.

Ability, not tenure, is

Editor:
I was pleased to see 
the letter in the Octo
ber 18th issue from Su
san Ambrose and Bar
bara Lazarus that
committee last year, the job before us 
was difficult. We had to select a winner 
from a pool of outstanding teachers. 
Examining a wide range of materials 
from FCEs to letters from students to 
course materials and then determining 
who the best of the best is no easy job.
However, one aspect made the process 
almost frustrating. Richard Schoenwald, 
the 1988 recipient of the award and a 
member of the committee, constantly 
voiced a complaint about the message 
we might send to the community .by not 
picking a tenured faculty member. I 
found this reasoning to be ludicrous. As 
any undergraduate can tell you, having 
tenure has nothing to do with teaching 
ability. Christian Hallsteins selection 
(and the nominations of other deserving 
teachers who were not selected) proves 
this statement.
Luckily, people like Linda Kaufman 
and Margaret Clark were sensible 
enough to see this. I thank them for their 
support during our discussions on this 
matter. I feel the committee made a fair 
decision without regard for how long the 
teacher has been at CMU or what tenure 
he or she may have.
I urge this years committee to do the 
same. Base your selection on the crite
ria only  nothing more or less. And I 
also urge undergraduate students to seek 
a position on the committee if any are 
available. Three undergraduates may 
participate, and their contributions are 
the most important since they are the 
ones who ultimately benefit from great 
teaching. I know this because my first 
chemical engineering professor (himself 
a recipient of the award) was the reason 
I chose my major.

cent Tartan editorial [Clintons lack of 
focus creates deficient a government 
(sic) 11/1]. His cartoonish account of 
U.S. foreign policy is so far from reality, 
the only question is whether he will 
choke on his own hypocrisy or drown in 
his own ignorance.
Singhal claims that America has seen 
its military as one of its strongest assets 
and has rarely fled from the opportunity 
to use this asset to bring democracy to 
countries around the world. To anyone 
who has extended their understanding 
of the history of U.S. foreign policy be
yond the Golden Book Encyclopedia and 
junior high school civics class, such a 
statement is positively ludicrous. Hun
dreds of volumes and thousands of ar
ticles have been written on the roles of 
the U.S. govemnment and military in 
underwriting and carrying out some of 
the most gruesome and cataclysmic 
events of this or any century. That his
tory goes unheeded in Singhals fantasy 
land of U.S. foreign policy beneficence. A 
few corrective remarks are therefore in 
order.
Singhals banal references to the war
against Vietnam are a disgrace. His sanc
timonious tribute to the death of young 
Americans and the memory of Vietnam [that] still lingers for many5 
amounts to self-serving, ethnocentric 
pity for the victims of a war that pro: 
duced over two million dead Vietnam
ese, decimated a country, and almost 
exterminated a culture. He claims that 
LBJs attentions were focused on do
mestic policies, and that as a result, the 
small conflict escalated into an alC 
out war.  The implication, of course, is 
that had -Johnson been focusing on 
Vietnam, the U.S. could have bombec 
the country into submission sooner. This 
interpretation of the Vietnam War 
completely incompatible with contend 
porary scholarship and state department 
documents. (See, for .instance, Gabriel 
Kolkos Anatomy of a War and Noans 
Chomskys Rethinking Camelot.) In fact 
under Kennedy and Johnson, the wai 
was being carried out by a first-worlc 
superpower in a fashion unprecedented 
in world history. During 1965 alone, 
in the midst of Johnsons Great Society initiatives, the U.S. military droppec 
more explosive tonnage on this smal 
country than had been dropped by al 
the armies in Europe during the en
tirety of WWII.
' Singhal might be interested to not* 
that in the closing years of the wai 
against Vietnam, the U.S. state depart
ment secretly authorized the relentles 
bombing of Cambodia  resulting in 
over a million dead, according to CIA 
estimates. (See After the Cataclysm, b 
Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky 
Scholars and officials have suggeste 
that the wreckage of the country wai 
integral to whipping up peasant support 
for the previously marginal Khmei 
Rouge. Several years later, the U.S. gov' 
emment (under Jimmy Carter) provided 
close to 90 percent of the arms, equip
ment, and much needed diplomatic a? 
sistance to Indonesia as it carried outs 
merciless slaughter of several hundred 
thousand East Timorese. (See The Wash
ington Connection, also by Herman ano 
Chomsky). A decade earlier, the U.S. 
government provided massive suppoi? 
to the Indonesian militarys extermina
tion of as many as 700,000 civilians, 
Since the mid-50s, the U.S. govern
ment and military have provided arms, 
supplies, training, and support for the 
militaries of Guatemala and El Salva; 
dor, both of whom have carried out maS 
sive exterminations of their own popula

responsible for the wholesale terrorize

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 November 19937
Privatizing Internet for the good of many
Adam C. Gross
Most members ofCongress acknowledge 
that the building of a nationwide informa
tion infrastructure is best left to private 
industry. Government ownership and con
trol of the information highway would be 
equivalent to government ownership and 
control of television or the press, which 
would lend itself to political manipulation 
and domination.
But for some reason, many people see 
private ownership of cyberspace as a threat. 
I believe these fears come from a misun
derstanding of the issues involved, and 
failure to recognize and explore the 100+ 
year history of telecommunications policy.
Specifically, I am talking about the 
privatization of the Internet. Historically, 
after Defense Advanced Research Project 
Agency (DARPA) gave it up, the Internet 
was funded and controlled by the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) (your tax dol
lars at work) for the purpose of using tele
communications technology to enhance 
research and education.
As the Internet has grown, and its uses 
and applications diversified, the NSF hks 
sought to privatize parts of the Internet, so
business and individuals can enjoy the ben
efits of computer based communications, 
without the NSF footing the bill.
Those who fear privatization feel that if 
the Internet is offered on a for-profit basis, 
then non-profit and individual users will be 
priced out of participating in this new me
dium.
Fortunately, the opposite is true. As the 
Internet is privatized, and connections are 
offered from a variety of competing provid
ers, two important results are realized. First, 
cost is lowered. By piggybacking Internet 
services on top of existing infrastructure, 
such as cable or telephone systems, com
mercial providers can offer Internet ser
vices for much lower cost than the NSF can.
Additionally, as more providers get in the 
business of offering Internet services, the 
number and means of connecting to the 
Internet increases. For example, Continen
tal Cablevision recently announced that it 
will start providing Internet access to its 
existing cable customers. Thats something 
a government-run Internet could never of
fer, as the government doesnt own any last 
mile connections into users homes and 
businesses.
America Online also offers Internet ac
cess, including e-mail and Gopher, for the 
reasonable price of about $3 per hour. So 
ultimately the result is that people not fortunate enough to be affiliated with a major 
university, like businesses, children, and 
the elderly, can begin to explore the oppor
tunities of being wired.
So whats the big deal? Recent articles, 
like the one that appears in the current 
Focus [The Internet and Privatization, 
10/93], would lead us to believe that if 
AT&T or Bell Atlantic provide Internet 
access, theyll come in and shut down our 
Gopher servers and close our e-mail ac
counts, or at least refuse to sell us access. 
This is plain malarkey.
When was the last time AT&T refused to 
carry your call because they didnt like 
what you were saying? They cant. By law 
theyre not allowed, because of a legal 
principle called non-discrimination, a part 
of common carriage, which has existed 
since 1934.
Even as the Internet moves towards 
privatization, the Internet as we experi
ence it (through CMU) wont change at all. 
In fact, with recent legislation, such as the 
High Performance Computing Act, Con
gress will be coughing up more money 
than ever to make sure we get our fair 
share of bboards and Nettrek.
In the future, CMUs connection to the 
Internet, as with all other educational 
institutions, will still be run by the NSF 
with the financial support of Uncle Sam.
Pending legislation would extend this 
system of subsidization to schools, li
braries, and hospitals.
So private, for-profit individuals and 
organizations can coexist happily with 
educational and public users of the 
Internet.
But ultimately, the Internet is inher
ently technically limited, and is not 
suited to handle real time services such 
as telephony and video.
The Internet is by no means a com
plete solution to Americas information 
infrastructure needs. Building a new, 
more advanced network, like TimeWamer and Bell Atlantic are currently 
exploring, brings to the table many 
more complex and difficult issues  
issues that the public should be ac
tively involved in.
However, before you send off a letter 
to your congressperson, you should 
make a reasonable effort to educate 
yourself about the history and nature 
of the issues that have to be resolved. 
And a great place to do that is on the 
Internet itself.

Senate deciding pivotal issue
Matt Ball
Recently, the Department of 
Naval Sciences (DNS) applied for 
a seat on Faculty Senate. Given 
the discriminatory policies of the 
Department of Defense, this re
quest has met with some contro
versy from those who are opposed 
to violating an individuals equal 
treatment under the law on the 
basis of sexual preference. But 
these concerns are overshadowed 
for many by the fact that the DNS 
is considered a legitimately con
stituted department that fulfills 
all criteria for Senate member
ship. Thus, it cannot be denied a 
seat. Any feelings of offens or 
outrage are expected to be subju
gated to proper procedure, play
ing politics by the precepts in 
place.
This is to be expected. As the 
privileged, it is easy for us to just 
coast by, collect our paychecks,
and bury our heads in the sand, 
arguing that the world will al
ways be cruel and unjust. But 
we are capable of more  of 
standing up for justice and com
passion every chance we have.
Rather than being an unfortu
nate but foregone conclusion, the 
vote faced by the Senate is piv
otal. It is not a question of homo
sexuality. Nor is it a case of 
simply determining if DNS 
meets a set of criteria. The issue 
at hand, which will have signifi
cant and revealing implications, 
is what place discrimination has 
at our institution of higher learn
ing.
Carnegie Mellon has strong 
ties to the military establish
ment. Much of the prestige and 
power that CMU commands has 
been built with money from gov
ernment contracts. Thus it is 
not surprising, given the per
ceived financial dependence, 
that something called Naval 
Sciences was granted depart
mental status by the bookkeep
ers and bureaucrats of the uni
versity. Given the inequitable 
and bigoted policies of the DoD, 
is the DNS a legitimately con
stituted department simply be
cause administrators deemed it 
worthy of that status? This is the 
question before the members of 
Faculty Senate. Indeed, it is the 
question each one of us must 
answer: Will we sanction with 
our vote or our silence institu
tionalized discrimination and the 
denial of equality to individuals?
If tempted by rationalizations 
of free and open dialogue, those 
on Senate who must answer this 
question on behalf of our univer
sity must ask themselves where 
they would draw the line. It is 
not difficult to imagine previous 
times when a southern univer
sity, due to a potentially large 
endowment from wealthy plan
tation owners, would have cre
ated a Department of Chattel 
Studies to find more efficient uses 
of slaves. Or in Nazi Germany, 
there could have been a statemandated Department of MinorPlease see DECISION, page 10

kind of opposition to U.S. state-corporate power 
church groups, peasant collectives, populist-nationalist fronts, labor organizations, journalists, 
teachers, intellectuals, and political parties of all 
stripes (not just communist). Similar situations 
have gone onfor decades throughout Latin America 
and Southeast Asia  U.S. government funding, 
training and support for authoritarian regimes in 
Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, the Philippines, Cam
bodia, Burma, and Thailand, replete with lavish 
U.S. military assistance and training, arms, sup
plies, and occasionally direct participation in 
ground sweeps, aerial assaults, interrogations, 
and executions. (See, for instance, Facing West by 
Richard Drinnon and Instruments of Statecraft by 
McCUntock.)
In short, far from bring[ing] democracy to coun
tries around the world, the U.S. government and 
military have consistently smashed democracy 
whenever and where ever populations have at
tempted to take control over their own destinies 
in ways counter to U.S. multinational corporate 
interest. (For an invaluable analysis, exhaus
tively cited, see Kolkos Confronting the Third 
World.)
Rather than simply reiterating comforting pi
eties in order to shore up his paranoiac conserva
tism, I strongly suggest that Singhal actually 
make use of his time at Carnegie Mellon to try to 
learn something about U.S. history. A genuine 
commitment to democracy demands nothing less. 
For as he continually makes apparent, the alter
native is willful ignorance in the service of simpleminded, ritualistic, patriotic bombast  empty 
of the facts and blind to forms of human suffering 
that have been the direct consequence of actions 
carried out by the very government and military 
Singhal so unquestioningly celebrates.

U.S. global policy at issue
NAFTA and GATT key to revision
David Schwartz
Our world is now moving in
exorably down an uncharted 
path laden with great potential, 
but marked by great uncer
tainty, confusion, and frequent 
pitfalls.
Fear of the unknown is clearly 
separating the timid and status 
quo-oriented from those with lu
cid future-vision.
It is sad to say, however, that 
a great many Americans seem 
to be falling into the former cat
egory.
Understandable as it may be, 
given that we have been accus
tomed to well-defined themes 
and ideas for the past half-cen
tury, such archaic thinking is 
proving to be more of a detri
ment than anything else.
In essence, it is a defensemechanism of sorts: when in 
doubt, become introspective and 
insular. However, this will not 
do, not now nor in the future.
The United States has reached 
a fork in the road: Does it follow 
the path of activ international
ism in the hope of fostering genu
ine multilateralism, or does it 
follow the path leading to isola
tionism and withdrawal?
Ross Perot, Patrick Buchanan, 
and other like-minded individu
als would argue that the latter 
is the way to go.
Those with a clearer sense of 
reality and a wider breadth of 
understanding would argue the 
former.
How the United States deals 
with the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and 
the General Agreement on Tar
iffs and Trade (GATT) from an
economic standpoint, and the 
issue of U.S. political and mili
tary commitments abroad (i.e. 
Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, etc.) will 
set very important precedents 
for years to come.
Despite what are very logical 
reasons for passing NAFTA 
within the context of the imme
diate U.S.-Mexico-Canada rela
tionship, NAFTA has great im
portance on a much larger scale.
It has the potential of acting 
as the glue to unite the nations 
of the Americas and to expedite 
approval of a greater global free 
trade regime as envisioned by 
GATT.
Acceptance of NAFTA would 
make the United States job of 
fostering global free trade easier, 
as ironic as this may sound, given 
the apparent tendency toward 
regional trading blocks.
It should be recognized that 
free trade principles are at the 
core of each blocks that is cur
rently evolving; in Europe this 
is much more developed than in 
Asia, for instance. The common 
denominator in all cases is the 
United States.
The United States is the only 
nation that has a sufficiently 
large economic and political 
stake in all those regions con
currently to bridge those blocks 
together under the GATT frame
work.
It is clearly much more diffi
cult to go forward with an allencompassing framework in one 
fell swoop than to unite micro
cosms of free trade entities.
Therefore, GATT and NAFTA, 
just like GATT and the Euro
pean Community, go hand in 
hand and need to be fully nur
tured simultaneously.
Only the United States can 
perform this task, and it is most

Bugs plague Clintons new health care plan
fjDeclan McCullagh
Last month, President Bill Clinton 
gave Congress a health care proposal 
that has been hailed as the most widereaching medical insurance plan ever. 
The hefty 1,300-page proposal, distrib
uted on floppy disks, explained how the 
administration plans to provide every
one with cheap, effective, efficient health 
care. Unfortunately, the disks them
selves were in need of at least a checkup, 
if not a few flu shots. According to wire 
reports, they were infected with a virus. 
Worse yet, this virus, called Stoned 3, 
first destroys computer files then puts a 
message on the screen say ing Legalize 
Marijuana.
The humor of the situation was lost on 
administration officials. But even if the 
plan doesnt legalize dope, its authors 
must have been all but high when they 
wrote it. If the dire warnings of the 
plans opponents prove correct, Clintons 
Health Security Act may result in gov
ernment control of health care, result
ing in health care rationing and everincreasing government spending.
According to Clinton, the plan will 
solve two problems: the growing num
ber of people who lack health insurance, 
and the steadily increasing amount of 
medical spending. If passed, the Health 
Security Act may very well solve the 
first problem and may stand a good 
chance of solving the second. But at 
what cost? The White House hasnt been 
able to come up with a straightforward 
answer.
On October 29, Donna Shalala, Health 
and Human Services secretary, said 40 
percent of Americans will face increased 
healthcare premiums. That seems clear 
enough. Clinton, however, seemed to be 
crunching some different figures when 
he said the next day, Finally, about 15 
percent, and only 15 percent of the Ameri
can people... will pay more for the same 
benefits.
The day after that, White House health 
care advisor and Clinton family friend 
Ira Magaziner reassured NBC viewers 
that only 15 percent of Americans would 
have to shell out more money. But a CBS
audience heard a different story a few 
hours later when Budget Director Leon 
Panetta said not 15 percent, but 40 per
cent of Americans would have to pay 
more.
Finally on November 3, Treasury Sec
retary Lloyd Bentsen said that even 
though some people got confused, the 
number is substantially less than 40 
percent, but [Health and Human Ser
vices] is working to clarify that, and 
well have you more definitive numbers.
It doesnt take a high-paid policy ana
lyst sporting tasseled loafers to realize 
somethings fishy here. This repeated 
confusion and double-talk on the part of 
administration officials doesnt ringtrue. 
The administration would have us be
lieve the same people who are asking us 
to trust them with our health care sys
tem cant do simple division. These are 
the same people that claim the extra 
medical costs will be covered by increased 
cigarette taxes. Thats not good enough.
Perhaps theres a simpler explana
tion: Clinton doesnt have a clue how 
much his proposal will actually cost. 
That might make more sense than you 
think. After all, its common knowledge
inside the Beltway that every entitle
ment program costs more than origi
nally anticipated.
Government health care plans, in par
ticular, have always suffered from ex
cess fat and costs well in excess of infla
tion. Medicare, for instance, cost $6.5 
billion when it soared to over $132 bil
lion.
Because Clintons proposed health care 
program doesnt have cost controls and 
doesnt spell out what happens in case of 
budget shortfalls, the same thing may 
happen. The program also fails to take 
into account some of the sizeable, but 
hidden, costs. For instance, one area the 
administration has almost ignored in its 
budget calculations is the medical needs 
of over three million illegal aliens in this 
county. Clinton has proposed a $1 bil
lion dollar fund to cover their needs. 
Thats nowhere near enough. California 
state officials say that plan would estab
lish couldnt even start to cover the costs 
of emergency room treatment in their 
state alone.
You see, federal law says everyone 
who goes to an emergency room has to 
receive treatment, even if they cant pay
for it. That means that non-paying ille
gal immigrants get a free ride, paid for ; 
by taxpayer dollars. These costs are tre-. 
mendous.
Another way taxpayers will be hurt is 
through Clintons plan to squeeze $2  
billion out of drug manufacturers by ; 
levying a tax of up to 17 percent on the - 
retail price of each drug. The ad
ministrations analysis doesnt take into  
account the billions in higher prices the ; 
drug companies will pass on to the con-; 
sumer.
These are a few examples of the bu-; 
reaucratic sleight of hand the White; 
House is using to fool the American . 
public. Even if the administration . 
chooses to ignore it, universal health ; 
care still has a real and substantial ; 
price. We just havent been told yet. So * 
keep in mind that while Clintons pro
posal may be able to provide every Ameri
can with decent health care, theres still  
one thing thats going to be crying out in ' 
pain: their wallets.

Right now, Sandra Shultz Newman is preparing 
to take her place on the Pennsylvania Common
wealth Court. Ron Castille is gearing up for a 10 
year term on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
And Tom Murphy is getting ready to begin his term 
as Pittsburghs mayor.
And I couldnt care less.
As a member of the Television Generation, I have 
seen many election time battles fought on televi
sion. I have seen Willy Horton move through a 
revolving door to elect a president. Ive seen enough 
flags waved to have a parade for electing public 
officials. Ive seen dirt of all kinds being slung by all 
parties to elect just about anyone.
I have never, though, seen anything so disgust
ing as the negative political advertisements used 
by the candidates of the Pennsylvania court races 
this year.
The first, and worst case: Newman versus Joe 
Mistickfor Commonwealth Court. At first, the ads 
for Commonwealth Court judge seemed pretty 
reasonable, and in fact, quite nice. Joe Mistickhad 
a cute little commercial where he pulled out a piece 
of tape, and on that tape it said, Mistick. Get it? 
Newman had her own commercial, showing her 
happily schmoozing with and hugging her con
stituents, with brief shots of her cute little grand
son indicating his approval. Then, the race got 
ugly. Mistick released a commercial which re
vealed that Newman had sent a private investiga
tor to dig up dirt on the Mistick campaign.
We were admonished to keep her Spying and 
Lying out of the Commonwealth Court. Newman 
fought back with a negative ad of her own. At the 
end of this ad, we are shown a large, black and 
white close-up of Mistick, as the voice over says, 
Would you do anything to win? Would you do 
anything to BEAT a WOMAN? Why didnt she
just go all the way and say, Joe Mistick, when did 
you stop beating your wife? Winner: Newman. I 
guess she would do (and did) anything to beat a 
man.
The second case: Russell Nigro versus Ron
Castille for Pennsylvania Supreme Court. These 
just started out ugly. The worst ad came from 
Nigros camp. The ad never actually mentioned 
Nigros name. The commercial ended with the 
words Not Ron Castille emblazoned on the screen, 
with Nigro only mentioned in passing in small 
letters at the bottom. Castille responded with ads 
illustrating how Nigro let drug dealers who sold 
cocaine to children off easily, but at least he de
cided to actually mention his own name in his own 
ad. Winner: Not Russell Nigro.
The third case: Tom Murphy versus Kathy
Matta. This campaign wasnt negative at all, but 
only because it didnt have to be. If Murphy actu
ally mentioned anyone elses name, their recogni
tion would have gone up 20 percent. Is it possible 
to have a contested race that isnt negative? Unfor
tunately, the answer appears to be, No way in 
hell.
Even if one candidate decides to take the high 
road, it seems that the other invariably decides to 
take the low road, forcing the first candidate to 
follow. To make things worse, negative ads have 
gone from indictments of the opponents poor record 
in office, to baseless personal attacks and name 
calling. It would appear that the candidates esti
mations of our intelligence is on the decline.
We, the voting public, need to stand up to this 
sort of thing. We should demand that politicians 
debate the issues, and not let the campaign de
grade into a kindergarten name calling match. We 
need to send a message saying, I dont care what 
your marketing experts say, these tactics just dont 
work.
Unfortunately, as of right now, they seem to 
work rather well. Until we fight back, politics will 
slide further and further into the gutter.

Humans beings superior to animals, should have more rights
(U
Ronak Singhal
The rights of animals as stated in the Constitu
tion: (none). Thats right, as far as our Constitution 
goes, animals have been given no rights. I do not 
believe that animals should be treated so cruelly, 
so heres an amendment to the Constitution that 
inaybe Congress should consider regarding animal 
Rights: All animals have the right to be eaten, tested 
6h) and worn by humans.
;' i believe that they have rights too, just different 
tights. Many people say that it is cruel to eat 
mdmals, so they become vegetarians. But what 
difference is there between a man eating a cow and 
jijion ripping a gazelle to death on the plains of the 
ferengeti? In my mind there is none.
< tSome people say that the way that we breed 
junmals to be killed and the way that we kill them 
cruel, but isnt death at the jaws of a lion just as, 
(/ not more, painful. To say that humans are cruel 
to other animals is almost redundant. Humans are 
animals, and by their very nature, any animal will 
(Jo almost anything to survive. We have just im] >roved upon a means of gathering food. By using 
: arm animals, we guarantee that there will be food 
or us, and we do it efficiently enough that most 
>eople in society do not have to spend a majority of 
lieir day searching for food, a characteristic differiiat from most animals. This brings up another 
joint. Many people say that animals are just as 
niart as human beings, so we should treat them 
ike we treat human beings. First of all, the premise 
hat other animals are as smart as humans is 
ft'surd. Im sure that as you are reading this,
: Jpmeone is writing a letter citing some study stat
ing that dolphins or apes, or some other animal, is 
just as intellectual as us. The fact is, that until 
other animals can develop complex civilizations 
that are able to communicate, travel, and reason 
like we can, animals will not have shown me that 
they are as smart as us.
Have you ever seen a dolphin make an aroundthe-world trip in less than 24 hours? Humans have 
designed machines that can. Have you ever seen a 
chimpanzee develop a means of sending signals 
thousands of miles? Humans can do that too. The 
list could go on, but the point is that animals have 
not shown that they have the intellectual capacity 
AND the ability to harness this capacity. Until 
then, there is no reason for us to treat them as 
equals. The second point of the premise is that we 
should treat animals as we treat humans. The 
truth of the matter is that we do not treat our own 
kind all that well to begin with, and that, as I 
mentioned before, our treatment of animals is no 
different from any other animals treatment of 
animals. This also raises the question of how we 
can call ourselves civilized if we act just like ani
mals? Again, I believe that we have built the great 
machines, the great cities, we are the animals that 
dominate the Earths land, and we are the ones 
who are able to investigate into the past. These are 
traits that animals do not have, traits that I believe 
place us higher on the chain of survival than them.
Then there is the question of whether wearing 
fur is wrong. I dont believe so. Fur is warm and it 
is natural. There is also a supply out there for our 
use. But people say that since we are so developed, 
why cant we synthesize our own material? We go 
ahead and do that, and what happens next? The 
same people are complaining that we are hurting 
animals by ruining the environment, because we 
are using too many chemicals in the production of 
synthetic cloth. Its impossible to have it both ways.
Animals are a natural source of clothing, so why 
shouldnt we use this available commodity to our 
advantage? Finally, there is the question of ethical 
treatment of animals in laboratory testing. I must 
admit that some testing has gone too far and that 
there is some real cruelty occurring that should be 
stopped. But for the most part, would you like to see 
untested chemicals out on the market? They could 
be cancer-causing, but we would not know unless it 
were for the testing done on animals. Just recently 
on the Space Shuttle Columbia, the astronauts 
decapitated rats in space so they could measure the 
effects of weightlessness on tissue. Before the as
tronauts had a chance to even land, there were 
people protesting the experiments. How is science
expected to make advances without doing actual 
testing? Would you rather see a human lose his life 
in the name of science or a rat? Humans are not 
cruel to other animals; we have just emerged from 
the survival of the fittest as'the most powerful 
figure in the animal kingdom. We have the power 
to destroy the planet, the power to turn nighttime 
into daylight, and the power to fly at unheard of 
speeds. Does this make us better than other ani
mals? I believe that it does, but other animals 
deserve their rights too, so let them be eaten, worn, 
and tested by us, and maybe they should be proud 
to have lived their lives for our pleasures.

Tartans show no mercy in 55-0 rout
Siket breaks CMU season-yardage mark in win over Catholic U.
By RICH KWIATKOWSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
The Tartans won their third game in a 
row with a 55-0 rout over the Catholic 
University Cardinals. The Cardinals fin
ished the game with a 1-7 record, and 
the Tartans improved to 7-2 overall, 
with a 3-0 record in University Athletic 
Association play. The Tartans are ranked 
seventh in the South Region after the 
48-7 defeat of Grove City last weekend.
Highlighting the victory was a recordsetting performance by senior wide re
ceiver Jarrod Siket. Siket came into the 
game needing only 89 receiving yards to 
break Mike Beresfords single-season 
record of 678 yards, set in 1988. Siket 
caught three passe^for 91 yards, includ
ing a 65 yard strike for a touchdown. The 
record-breaking reception came early in 
the fourth quarter on a pass from junior 
quarterback Matt Neiss. Siket needs 
only two more touchdown passes to break 
Joe Chemeys 1968 record of eight touch
down receptions.
We attacked Catholic with our nor
mal game plan. If you do your job right, 
good things will come* said Siket.
I couldnt be more happy for Jarrod, 
saidhead coach RichLackner. We never 
discussed breaking a record. These
things come with winning. Jarrod 
couldnt be more deserving.
Another personal milestone was 
reached during the game when junior 
halfback Jason Grusky rushed for 70 
yards. This puts him over the 1,000 yard 
mark for his career. Grusky also scored 
three touchdowns against Catholic, in
creasing his total to 11 career touch
downs.
Gru skys backfield counterpart, senior 
fullback Brian Horton, scored touch
downs in the last nine games and is the 
Tartans leading rusher with 508 yards 
on 130 carries. Horton has rushed for 
1,083 yards and 17 touchdowns in his 
career.
The defense also deserves a mention. 
The defense registered their first shut
out of the season, holding the Cardinals 
to 118 total yards, an average of only 2.2 
yards per play. Sophomore inside line
backer Mark Kasperowicz had a career 
game, registering 14 tackles  five of 
them for losses  a fumble recovery, 
and one interception which he returned 
for a touchdown. Senior inside linebacker 
Jeff Blue registered eight tackles, while 
junior defensive back Joe Ferris and 
senior defensive tackle Shane Billings 
contributed with six tackles each.
We just did everything we have been

doing all year. Coach Bodnar put us in 
the right place and everybody executed, 
said senior inside linebacker and co
captain Chad Wilson. We are going to 
treat the last game like every game 
since the Trinity loss: score 40 or more 
points and shut them out.
The defense, however, lost senior de
fensive tackle Ben Burton for the game 
and the season. Burton left the game 
with a broken right thumb after the 
opening kickoff.
We have to feel for Ben. He is a 
captain and a team leader and it is a 
shame hell miss playing in his last 
game, said Lackner.
The Tartans amassed 516 total offen
sive yards  262 yards rushing and 254 
yards passing. Junior quarterback Chris 
Dee threw 10 completions on 16 attempts 
and two interceptions for 181 yards with 
two touchdown passes. Neiss was near 
perfect, completing four of five passes 
for 60 yards, including one pass for a 
touchdown. Sophomore quarterback 
Keith Dickerson contributed with one 
completion for 13 yards.
We did what we wanted to against 
them. They were not a good team, said 
Dee. The line played great and the 
defense played a great game. They were 
blitzing and daring us to pass. We did 
and got the big scores.
The Cardinals received the ball first 
and seemed to be stopped on fourth 
down with 10 yards to go. The Cardinals 
opted to punt, but CMU received a 15- 
yard roughing the kicker call. The Car
dinals took advantage of the penalty 
and rushed to the Carnegie Mellon 31 
yard line on the back of freshman run
ning back Matt Taylor. On second and 
10 sophomore quarterback Ray Will
iams fumbled the snap from center and 
it was recovered by Kasperowicz.
The Tartans took over on the Catholic 
35 yard line but could not capitalize and 
was forced to punt. Catholic punted on 
their next series and CMU took over one 
their own 32 yard line. The drive ended 
on the second play with Dees first inter
ception of the game, returned to the 
CMU 38 yard line.
Taylor rushed for 26 yards on the first 
play to the CMU 16 yard line, and the 
Cardinals were threatening to score. The 
drive went to fourth and 14, and the 
Cardinals opted for the first down rather 
than a field goal attempt. Williams was

CMU hockey team loses to 
West Virginia University 9-1
By KYMBERLY BARTLO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The competition between the Carnegie Mellon 
Ice Hockey Club and West Virginia University 
(WVU) Mountaineers hockey spans at least two 
years. First, the Tartans won the Championship 
against WVU in 1992. Then last season WVU 
defeated the Tartans for the title. Last Sunday 
they met each other at CMUs home ice in 
Monroeville where the Mountaineers skated off 
with a 91 win.
In the first period, WVU scored three goals against 
Tartan graduate student goalie Scott Berry. Two 
penalties were called on WVU for rough play and 
interference, but the Tartans were unable to capi
talize on either power play. To their credit, they 
landed 12 shots on WVU goalie Mike Dolan.
In the second period, the Mountaineers scored 
another three goals against Berry. Sophomore cen
ter Roger Maddalena played a little too aggres
sively, receiving two penalties for his efforts, for 
tripping and unsportsmanlike conduct.
Maddalena said, Most of the time, Im the one 
pulling people out of fights ... But we were playing 
poorly and I was getting frustrated. The Tartans 
gave the Mountaineers three more power plays for 
slashing, tripping, and holding, helping to increase 
WVUs advantage.
The Tartans came back onto the ice for the third 
period ready to match their opponents energy but 
to little avail. Three more goals slid by CMU 
freshman goalie Jon KUegman. WVUs Ray Smith 
hit in his third goal of the night, closely followed by 
two more goals from Paul Pipke. CMU retaliated 
as team captain and right wing Dave Umland, a 
grad student scored with the assistance of 
Maddalena and senior defenseman Chris Chicoskie.
The Tartans gave the Mountaineers another 
four power plays in the third period, while the 
Mountaineers were only half as generous, giving 
two. Maddalena went in for his third penalty, this 
time for tripping, andjunior left wing John Cardillo
received his second penalty for interference. Gradu
ate student left wing George Mueller was called for 
rough play, and junior Constantine Davides got 
two minutes for elbowing.
Cardillo had a penalty shot but failed to put the 
puck into the net. Describing the shot, Cardillo 
said I had a breakaway on the net and I shot, but 
one of the defenseman stopped the puck from going 
over the goal line...The goalie was good. When I 
shot for the penalty he made a pad save on the short 
side of the net.
A small scuffle occurred in the third period when 
Mountaineer Brett Sears, sitting on the bench, 
grabbed Cardillo on the ice. Both were given pen
alties, Sears for a bench minor and Cardillo for 
interference, and they finished the game sitting 
out.
Goalies Berry and Kliegman made a heroic at
tempt to keep the game even with a total of 39 
saves, but the offense was unable to score on WVU. 
We were frustrated by the third period. They 
stayed one step ahead of us the entire game.. .Their 
game showed a lot more discipline, said senior left 
wing Mike Gallin.
The Tartans were coming off a Saturday away 
game against Slippery Rock, which they lost 5-4. 
The teams record now stands at 1-2.
All in all, the Tartans gave a good effort but could 
not break through West Virginias strong defense.' 
The Tartans were unable to coordinate their of
fense and defense. Their burst of energy in the 
third was wonderful to watch but mostly resulted 
in penalties and crushing body checks. Not many 
fans turned out for the game, perhaps leaving the 
Tartans uninspired to play their best.
On November 6, the Tartans played an exhibi
tion game against the Pittsburgh Stars, a local 
hockey club, in Harmarville, and then the Indiana 
University of PA in Monroeville the next night.
CMU hockey will not meet up with West Virginia 
University again until February, giving CMU 
plenty of time to sharpen up their game for a 
rematch.
Ruggers hang on to win over 
Wheeling Jesuit College 22-12
By JUSTIN LAM
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The CMU rugby team continues to improve, 
notching another win this past Saturday over 
Wheeling Jesuit College, by the score of 2212. 
This was the Tartans first victory over Wheeling 
in three years.
Braving the cold weather, CMU looked sharp 
right from the beginning. Smooth transition plays 
from the forwards to the backs allowed for quick 
scoring.
Carnegie Mellon Alumni Chris Devlin was 
able to punch in a try within the first five min
utes of play, making the score 5-0.
Sophomore Javier Roach Eocha faked out the 
Wheeling defense, and, a few moves later, found 
himself in the end zone to make the score 10-0. 
The first half continued on, characterized by 
good defense and excellent forward plays that 
allowed CMU to dominate possession of the ball.
Senior Greg Pigeon Boules darted through 
Wheeling to score again at the end of the first half 
to put the Tartans up 15-0. Senior captain Wild
Bill Lucier said We capitalized on all our op
portunities and played mistake free ball.
The second half began much like the first half, 
with Lucier blazing through the Wheeling de
fense half the length of the field to increase the 
score to 22-0.
After this score, the Tartans became compla
cent and let down their guard. Wheeling was 
able to gain some momentum. With 25 minutes 
remaining in the half, Wheelings Paul Hayes 
broke through to make the score 22-5.
Wheeling kept the ball in CMUs end for the 
remainder of the game where their scrum-half 
Frank Nechay scored another try to make the 
score 22-12. That would be as close as Wheeling 
would get as time ran out.
If CMU can continue their level of play, they 
will stand strong in next spring1 s Blood Tourna
ment. Overall, the teams level of play has been 
at its best in three years, and this semesters 5-
2 record shows it.
The team finishes off.the season on the road 
against a team from Westmoreland, PA next 
week.
Basketball to scrimmage this week
By LUBOMIR W. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Sports Editor
The Tartans upcoming basketball season is just around the corner. To help Carnegie Mellon 
prepare for it, the mens basketball team will take on St. Vincent College on Wednesday, November 
10. Game time is 7 pm in Skibo Gymnasium.
Then, on Saturday, the team will hold its annual Cardinal/White game, an intrasquad contest 
between the returning veterans and new recruits. Game time is 7 pm.
Both scrimmages will offer the fans and students of Carnegie Mellon a chance to get a sneak peak 
at this years team which is expected to contend for the UAA title this season. Last season the team 
finished 16-8, and third place in the UAA. Please come out and show your support for the new and 
returning players. A great chance for all of you to practice being a sixth man.
The preview of the mens and womens teams will appear in next weeks issue of the Tartan.

Bloody pulp makes bad image for hockey
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
'When Washington Capitals center 
Dale Hunter laces up his skates and 
iakes to the ice on Friday, November 26, 
against the Pittsburgh Penguins, it will 
mark the end of one of the longest sus
pensions of professional sports history:
21 games. Considering that 21 games is 
one-fourth of the NHL season, the sus
pension is even more significant.
J  Hunters suspension for deliberately 
'injuring Islanders star Pierre Turgeon 
during the playoffs was the first salvo in 
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettmans cru
sade to crack down on hockey violence. 
Bettman and league senior vice-president Brian Burke have made it quite 
clear that excessively violent acts will no 
ionger be tolerated.
This 1993-94 season will certainly be 
remembered as the year of the suspen
sion. Already this season, six players 
have been suspended for senseless acts 
of on-ice violence.
Hartford winger Nick Kypreos (traded 
to the Rangers) was suspended for five 
games for a late hit on Dallas James 
Black, causing a gash that required 20 
stitches.
Montreal defenseman Kevin Haller 
was suspended for four games for bla
tantly slashing Rangers captain and 
center Mark Messier.
Chicago star defenseman and 1992- 
93 Norris Trophy winner Chris Chelios 
sat out four games because he picked up 
an instigator, misconduct, and double 
game misconduct in a game against the 
Hartford Whalers. Chelios totaled 51 
penalty minutes in that game.
Bob Rouse of the Toronto Maple Leafs 
and bruiser Bob Probert of the Detroit 
Red Wings each were suspended for four 
games for a stick duel on October 15. 
Proberts suspension resulted from a 
misconduct penalty for resisting an offi
cial after the altercation was broken up. 
Rouses forced benching resulted from a 
similar penalty he received for deliber
ately attemptingto injure Probert. Rouse 
took a baseball-bat-style swing with his 
stick at Proberts head.
Doug Houda of the Whalers (traded to 
Chicago) was suspended for five games 
because of a match penalty for head
butting Buffalo defenseman Randy 
Moller on October 10.
Including Hunters suspension, the 
NHL has already lost 47 man-games to 
disciplinary action this season. Bettman 
and Burke have declared that suspen
sions will become more and more fre' quent. Players will also pick up addi
tional suspension time for being repeat 
offenders. Proberts four-game suspen
sion was more for his past reputation of 
violence rather than for this actual in
fraction.
Violence is a fact of hockey life. The 
league has come a long way since the 
bench-clearing-brawls of the late 70s, 
but excess violence still abounds. As of 
yet, the NHL has not totally eliminated 
fighting. However, a player found to 
instigate a fight receives a minor pen
alty and an automatic game miscon
duct.
Except for fighting, game misconducts 
are almost always attached to all major
penalties, especially high-sticking, slash
ing, and spearing. The current rules say 
that every three game misconducts re
sult in an automatic one-game suspen
sion.
The fighting question is a particularly 
difficult one for league officials. Fights 
are popular with many hockey fans, but 
are the antithesis of the family-oriented 
entertainment image the league wants 
to project. Many of the leagues top stars, 
including Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Brett Hull, and Steve Yzerman, 
have spoken out against fighting.
The most pressing reason for cutting 
back on flagrant violence is the increase 
in serious injuries among professional 
athletesa problem that is not hockeys 
alone. For instance, this year has been a 
bad time to be an NFL starting quarter
back. As players get bigger and stron
ger, the injuries they will be able to 
inflict will become similarly harsh.
Just last week, Torontos Nikolai 
Borschevsky had his spleen ruptured by 
a normal, legal check. Borschevsky re
quired emergency surgery to remove his 
spleen and will be out until mid-Janu
ary at the earliest.
The league needs to find a healthy
balance between the physical play of. 
fered by players like Ulf Samuelsson 
Marty McSorley, Tie Domi, Mike Peluso, 
and Basil McRae, and the sharp finesse 
of Gretzky, Lemieux, and Teeniu 
Selanne.
I believe fighting will, and should, 
always remain a part of the game. Flj 
admit it; I enjoy watching an occasional 
fight and I cheer when the team Im 
rooting for crushes their opponents into 
the boards. However, players shown to 
be consistent and flagrant violators of 
the rules should be suspended for longer 
and longer durations.
The NHL also seriously^ needs to look 
at the possibility of giving all three onice officials the power to call penalties as 
is the case in the NBA. Once more pen
alties are called, and more suspensions 
are handed out, fewer players will be 
injured as a result and the game will be 
more marketable. Bettmans goal is to 
push the NHL as family entertainment. 
Allowing people to be beaten into a bloody 
pulp doesnt exactly fit that image.

Belle scores winner in 1995 World Series
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
| Joe Carters game-6-ending home run in the 
1993 World Series was definitely one of the most 
! dramatic moments in baseball history. But tell me 
"baseball fans, does it outdo game seven of the 1995 
I'World Series when the Cleveland Indians win in 10 
innings over the Pittsburgh Pirates on a suicide 
squeeze play by slugger Albert Belle of all people? 
! Now, Im definitely no Jimmy the Greek, and 
chances are that something like that would never 
happen. But it isnt going out on a limb by saying 
! that those two teams could be playing each other in 
the 1995 World Series. Last week we peered into 
the not so distant future of the Bucs, and this week 
the coming success of the Cleveland Indians will be 
! discussed.
 The Cleveland Indians, a team which up till now 
has played in a stadium many refer to as the 
! mistake by the lake, has long been the butt of all 
i baseball humor. Hollywood even went as far as to
i make a movie describing the completely unrealistic scenario of the Indians winning not a World 
; Series, but a mere division title of all things.
; But all things are subject to eventual change, 
1 and believe it or not, Tribe fans, the Indians are no 
; exception. With a new stadium scheduled to open 
for the start of the 1994 season, a lineup which 
; already features some of the most prominent offen
sive forces in baseball, and a minor league system 
which is producing some of the best young talent in 
the game, success lies on the horizon for the tribe.
The strength of the Indians starts in the dugout 
with their young manager Mike Hargrove. 
Hargrove proved his worth this season, when he 
was able to lift his team past the spring training 
deaths of pitchers Tim Crews and Steve Olin, and 
lead the Indians to a respectable second half. 
Despite lack of experience, Hargrove should be 
able to lead his team into contention as early as 
next year, for he now possesses all the integral 
parts of the winner. The key will be to keep them all 
healthy.
Yet the phrase staying healthy is not one that 
is understood by the majority of Indians pitchers. 
Already beleaguered by the deaths of Olin and 
Crews, the pitching staff was further depleted 
early on by injuries to staff ace Charles Nagy, and 
number two starter Bob Ojeda who was hurt in the 
accident which killed Crews and Olin. But early 
projections are calling for both Nagy and Ojeda to 
be at full strength by the start of spring training, 
thus providing the Indians with a very respectable 
one-two punch.
Nagy when healthy, can be placed among the top 
three pitchers in the American League, and he has 
the movement and velocity to continue to remain at 
the top of the AL pitching ranks.
Ojeda meanwhile is a proven veteran who will 
win on a consistent basis and provide leadership 
for an extremely young Indians staff. The only 
problem with Ojeda is that he is a free agent, but 
all early indications point to him staying in Cleve
land. Even if Ojeda doesnt sign, the Indians have 
a slew of young arms to stick in his spot and the 
remaining turns in the rotation. Other organiza
tions have long sought to acquire some of the
Indians prospects including Chad Ogea, Dave 
Mlicki, Alan Embree, Pete Janicki, and Julian 
Tavarez. Other prized pitchers include the ones 
who are already in the staff such as Mark Clark 
and Jose Mesa, who both proved last year that they 
can be winners in the majors.
Although the promise is definitely promising for 
next year, chances are it will be a bit shaky early 
on, but the young starters will be able to rest easy 
with the knowledge that if they keep the Tribe in 
the game most leads will be safe with their more 
than capable bullpen.
With the loss of Crews and Olin, most thought 
the Indians bullpen would disintegrate. Not only 
did it do the exact opposite of that in1993 but it also 
blossomed for it allowed for the emergence ofyoung 
talent such as Jerry DiPoto, Bill Wertz and Tom 
Kramer. DiPoto is the closer of the future and is 
more than adequate as shown by his eleven saves 
following his late midseason callup. He throws a 
hard slider thus inducing many ground call outs, 
but can get the strikeout when necessary as evi
dences by his 41 strikeouts in 56 innings.
The bullpen is further enhanced by young veter
ans, Derek Lilliquist and Jeremy Hernandez who 
both have consistently had low eras over the past 
few years, and are both extremely durable and 
dependable as shown by the combined 141 innings 
they threw in 93. If need be, management can also 
throw some of their young starters into the bullpen, 
and there are rumors floating around of a deal 
sending Dennis Eckersley to the Indians.
Although the pitching staff will have to come 
together for the Tribe to be a winner, it will not 
have to do half the work that it would on another 
team due to the incredible potency of the Indians 
offense.
It all start in the outfield where the Indians have
the makings of one of the best threesome in the 
game. In left field, slugger Albert Belle just gets 
better and better. Although it is hard to improve on
38 HR and 129 RBI, Belle is still young and is just 
starting to realize his potential. In center the 
Indians field the fastest man in the American 
League in Kenny Lofton.
Lofton, who has only been in the league for two 
years, has already won the Rookie of the Year 
award in 1992, last seasons stolen base crown and 
has established himself as a .300 hitter. The right 
fielder for the Indians this season was a 30 year old 
rookie named Wayne Kirby who surprised the 
entire league with his 60 rbis and 17 sbs from the 
number two hole. All this offense also overshadows 
the fact that this trio led the AL in outfield assists 
and with speedsters Lofton and Kirby can cover a 
lot of ground as well.
The infield also has its own share of stars includ
ing two who have already played in an all-star 
game. It starts with the backstop Sandy Alomar Jr 
who following his Rookie of the Year season in 1990 
has been somewhat of a disappointment due to 
injuries. But by mid season in 1993, Alomar was 
back in full form showing why he was the most 
prized catching prospect in the majors, just four 
years ago.
At first, the Tribe features a platoon of young 
sluggers Paul Sorrento and Reggie Jefferson who 
in 1993 combined for 28HR and 94 RBI along with 
sparkling defense (a combined 9 errors).
At shortstop the Indians have Felix Fermin who 
does a more than adequate job with his glove and 
this season did a little something at the plate as 
well with a .260 average and 45 RBI from the ninth 
spot in the order.
They also have young prospect Mark Lewis who

BASEBALL, from page 12
has floundered on several previous op
portunities but with a little more matu
rity should eventually develop into one 
of the better shortstops in the majors.
The third baseman for the Tribe is Jim 
Thome,the 24 year old MVP of the Inter
national League last year, who in a late 
season call up showed why he was given 
the afore mentioned distinction in the 
minors. In just 154 at bats he hit 7 hrs 
and hit left handed pitching at a .302 
clip. Thome will naturally run into the 
growing pains which accompany all 
youngsters coming up in the majors, but 
Thome has the ability to become a Dave 
Hollins caliber player and could solidify 
a position that had been a lost cause for 
some time now.
Naturally the best is saved for last, 
and the best lies at second base in Carlos 
Baerga. Peter Gammons recently said 
that he feels the only player in the ma
jors right now who can eventually reach 
3,000 hits is Baerga, and he is playing in 
an age which features names such as 
Wade Boggs, and Tony Gwynn. Baerga 
is just a natural at the plate. Anything 
he wants is his for the taking. He is the 
first Indian to have two back to back 200 
hit seasons in about three decades, and 
that is only a shadow of what else he can 
do. 21 hrs, 114 rbis and a .321 avg all 
speak for themselves. He did commit 17 
errors but improvements on defense will 
come along with age.
One must also not forget the Desig
nated Hitter for the Indians feature a 
man who is considered by many the best 
hitting prospect in the game. Manny 
Ramirez is apparently the real thing. 
Home runs, high average, and speed are 
all categories in which Ramirez should 
eventually excel in. Of course if Ramirez 
fails, the Indians have Candy Maldonado 
and Randy Milligan who have shown 
what they can do with a bat for the past 
several years.
The Indians are doing things right in 
a time when multi-milllion dollar con
tracts and rent-a-player methods have 
brought many teams to a halting crash. 
John Hart, the General Manager, has 
locked up the majority of his young play
ers to long term deals thus averting thp 
problems which will soon be caused by 
the impending loss of revenue which all 
teams will face.
He has stockpiled the minor league 
system, much in the style of the Atlanta 
Braves, thus if the current plan fails, 9. 
backup plan is in order.
Fan support that was so vividly por
trayed in the movie Major League, will 
soon strike the city of Cleveland.
Its about time. Imagine going 39 years 
without winning a division or pennant. 
And we thought Red Sox fans had it 
tough!!!!

Dolphins, Bills pass with flying colors
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
As we approach the halfway point of the 1993 
season, it is time to take a tour around the NFL and 
see how everyone is doing. This week well look at 
the American Football Conference (AFC), next 
week the National Football Conference (NFC).
The AFC East is loaded with talented teams, but 
only two have winning records. The Dolphins get 
an A+ for their performance so far (theyre starting 
to look like the teachers pet). Scott Mitchell re
placed Dan Marino on October 10 and led the 
Dolphins to a comeback victory over the Browns. 
Mark Ingram and Irving Fryar have made us 
forget about Mark Clayton and Mark Duper, while 
the Dolphin defense has played consistently well 
all year.
Meanwhile, in Buffalo, the Bills are having 
dreams of another Super Bowl. The defense has 
played very well with a healthy Bruce Smith, while 
the offense continues to put plenty of points on the 
board. The Bills have beaten the Giants and Cow
boys, two of the better NFC teams. However, the 
Bills loss to the Dolphins at home means theyll be 
taking home an A instead of an A+.
The Jets, behind Boomer Esiason and Ronnie 
Lott, have become one of the most improved teams 
in the AFC. However, despite a great year by 
Esiason, the J ets have blown two bigleadsandfind 
themselves at 3-4. The Jets, with their big win over 
the Giants last week, show that they are not just 
average, so they get a B-.
The AFC East has two down and out teams. 
First, the Colts, who get a C, thanks to plenty of 
injuries, are in trouble. Jeff George held out for a 
couple of weeks, and then Steve Emtman got hurt 
when George came back. The Colts dont have 
much depth on either side of the ball, so dont 
expect much from them the rest of the way.
The Patriots are young, inexperienced, and strug
gling. Well give them a passing grade of D- because 
they stay in most of their games right to the end.
There arent too many happy faces in the AFC 
Central. The Browns, who lead the division, seem 
to have internal problems. Thanks to a third place 
schedule, the Browns dont have many tough games 
on the road. However,Cleveland has beaten the 
49ers and they are 5-2, so they get a B+.
The Steelers, on the other hand, are better than
4-3. Inconsistency cost them a victory against the 
Rams, and special teams cost them the Browns 
game. The offense is moving the ball well and the 
defense has been spectacular at times. However, 
even though the Steelers are playing well, they 
have been only able to accumulate four wins, so 
they get a B.
The Oilers get a D+. They have played horribly 
at times (look at the Bills game) and have only one 
significant victory coming against the Chiefs in 
Week 2. The Oilers little comeback against strug
gling teams could soon end when they have to play 
the Steelers and Browns.
The Bengals have more holes than Swiss cheese. 
Carl Pickens is one of the only pluses on this 0-7 
team. David Shula and the Bungles have failed 
the first half of the season. The road to comeback 
for the Bengals, who have earned a big F, is very 
long.
Kansas City is atop the AFC West with a 5-2 
record. With Joe Montana, the Chiefs get a g,u 
but without him they get a C. Overall the Chiefs get 
a B-. The Chiefs defense has been up and down all 
year. One big addition to the offense has been
Marcus Allen. However, the Chiefs must depend 
on Montana to get them into the Super Bowl.
Denver is kind ofin the same boat as the Steelers. 
Despite leading the league in passing, Elway has 
only been able to deliver four wins. Reggie White 
(and his late game sacks) and that Raiders kicker 
(Jeff Jaeger) handed the Broncos back to back 
losses that hurt. The Broncos get a B for their 
performance so far.
The Raiders get a B-. They started off looking 
good, but they have allowed themselves to slip to 4
3. The Raiders, thanks to Jeff Hostetler, are stay
ing just above average.
The Seahawks get a C+. Despite some disap
pointing losses, Seattle seems to have a future in 
the NFL. The defense is playing as good as last 
year, and the Seahawks also seem to have an 
offense!
The Chargers offense performs like a sick bird. 
Although they can run the ball (sometimes), they 
know they cant pass the ball. The Charger defense 
can take all the credit for all three victories so far 
this year. The Chargers get a D.
I picked three of five in Week 9, running my 
record to 26 right out of 45. The big surprise this 
week was the N.Y. Jets. For their giant win over 
that other New York team, the Jets are the Team 
of the Week. The Jets, on the road, while still at 
their home in Giants Stadium, stopped the Giants 
at the goal line with less than a minute to play to 
get the 10-6 win. The Bosworth Award goes to 
the Chiefs. Their defense seemed to just stand and 
watch as Scott Mitchell completed 22 of 33 for 344 
yards and led his team to a 30-10 victory. Maybe 
the Dolphins can go to the Super Bowl without 
Marino! The Cowboys outclassed the Eagles with a
2310 victory in a downpour in Philadelphia. 
Emmitt Smith almost beat Jim Brown on his best 
day (actually they tied) as Smith rolled up 237 
yards rushing. Detroit beat Minnesota 30-27, 
thanks to an interference call on the Vikings late in
the game that set up the final touchdown. The 
Lions defense looks to be a bit underrated, too 
Despite throwing for 424 yards, Jeff Hostetler 
couldnt get a victory fortheRaiders.DonaldFrants 
102 yard interception jog helped the Chargers 
pull out a 30-23 victory, pushing their record to 3-
4.
My not so interesting list continues to grow. 
The Pack beat the Bears 17-3. The Bears offense 
seems to be nonexistent. The Colts slid by the 
Patriots 9-6. The 49ers creamed the Rams 40-17, 
The Broncos handed the Seahawks a 28-17 defeat. 
The Bucs finally got another win as they beat 
Atlanta 3124. The Saints offense continues to 
struggle as the Saints squeaked by the Cardinals 
20-17. And finally the Bills beat the Redskins 24- 
10 on Monday Night Football.
Top Five Picks for Week 11
1. Buffalo at Pittsburgh
The Bills defense has looked good primarily 
because they have created so many turnovers. If 
the Steelers dont turn the ball over more than once 
they will win this one. Steelers 24-21.
2. Minnesota at Denver
This one looks like a close one until you see it is 
being played at Denver. Broncos 30-17.
3. Green Bay at New Orleans
The Packers passing game will be able to get to 
the Saints. The Saints offense is really in trouble. 
Packers 30-20.
4. Miami at Philadelphia
Scott Mitchell replaces Marino a lot better than 
OBrien replaces Cunningham. The Dolphins de
fense, led by Marco Coleman, will be able to stop 
the Eagles. Dolphins 27-17.
5. Cleveland at Seattle
The Browns have to go up to Seattle to play in the 
dome. The Browns should be able to pull this one 
out, but it will be close. Browns 20-16.

Football team records first shutout of season
FOOTBALL, from page 11
sacked by Kas-perowicz for a nine-yard 
loss which set the tone for the Tartan 
defense.
The Tartans took over and returned to 
their pounding ground game. Horton 
and Grusky brought the ball 68 yards, 
including four consecutive first down 
plays, to the Catholic seven yard line. 
Horton advanced the ball six more yards 
to the Catholic one yard line. The next 
two rushes netted no gain and the Tar
tans were faced with a fourth and goal 
on the Cardinal one yard line. The Tar
tans opted to go for the touchdown. Dee 
dropped back, faked to Grusky, and hit
bump and run, man-to-man defense 
which is tough to cover. We went with 
our far hook play, gave Chris time, and 
came up with the big touchdown, said 
Siket.
I am very proud of J arrod, said offen
sive coordinator Rich Erdelyi. He had a 
rough season last year. He did not fulfill 
his potential. He worked hard and made 
tremendous strides and has confidence 
in himself.
Carnegie Mellon received the ball af
ter a 30-yard Catholic punt. The Tar
tans gave up the ball on the first play 
with Dees second interception. Catholic 
took over at the beginning of the second
line. Dee went to the air again, complet
ing two passes in a row to Mathias for 
gains of 22 and 13 yards. The Tartans 
brought the ball to the Catholic 39 yard 
line before returning to the ground with 
Horton and Mathias. The Tartans rushed 
the ball to the Catholic seven before the 
drive stalled on a fourth and three rush 
that fell: one -yard-short..
What the offense could not produce 
the defense did. On the third Cardinal 
play after the goal line stand, 
Kasperowicz tipped the pass from Will
iams and stayed with it. He returned the 
interception ten yards for a touchdown. 
The Harding extra point made the score
28-0.
We were playing 
our normal zone 
coverage, and I was 
on man-to-man 
coverage with the 
running back. I 
read the quarterhalf with junior quarterback Matt Neiss 
leading the Tartan offense. Neiss picked 
up where Dee left off. The Tartans scored 
on their first drive of the second half, 
with a five-yard touchdown by Grusky, 
set up by a 17-yard pass from Neiss to 
senior wide receiver Andy Van Sprang. 
The Tartans continued to roll, 42-0.
<3V[att:Neiss is a fine quarterback. He 
is a. consummate team player and a 
student ofthe game, said"Erdelyi. We 
wanted to put him in despite the score. 
I wanted him in earlier, but Chris was 
warm, and when Chris gets warm he 
has to stay warm. If Chris came out, he 
was going to stay out because of the 
possibility ofinjuryinthe cold weather.
The Tartans scored two more touch
downs in the third quarter. These two 
scores came with the Tartans secondteam offense in the game. The second 
third-quarter touchdown was scored by 
freshman halfback Buck Neel from four 
yards out, and capped off a nine-play,
Erdelyi.
The shutout brings the Tartans closer 
to a playoff spot in the South Region. 
Two of the the top three teams in the 
South Region, Washington and Jefferson 
and Wilkes won, ensuring themselves a 
spot in the /playoffs. Number two 
Frostburg State was upset 24-22 by 
Wayne sburg College andthe fourth place 
team, Dickinson, lost to Gettysburg Col
lege 28-7. Frostburg will probably drop 
to thirdafter suffereing its first loss of 
the season. They now stand at 81.
The Dickinson loss gives them two 
losses on the season and may open the 
door for another team to take over the 
number four playoff spot.
Currently,- Dickinson, Moravian, 
Emory & Henry, Carnegie Mellon and 
Fairleigh Dickinson are all at 72 on the 
season. With CMUs last two huge victo
ries they are in good shape to take over 
the last playoff spot in the South.
I think we are one of the top four

sophomore halfback Mike Mathias for a 
one-yard touchdown pass. Senior 
placekicker Fred Harding added the 
extra point for a 7-0 Tartan lead.
Catholic could only advance the ball
13 yards on their next drive, and so they 
opted to punt and CMU took over on 
their own 37 yard line. After a Horton 
rush, Dee found Siket downfield and 
threw a perfect pass, taking Siket into 
the end zone for a 65-yard touchdown 
pass. This play is the longest play from 
scrimmage for the Tartans this season. 
The Tartans increased their lead to 14- 
0.
We fought hard and they just were 
not prepared. We had the momentum 
from the first play. [Catholic] played a
quarter but was forced to punt after 
three plays.
The Tartans took over on their own 42 
yard line and returned to the ground 
with Horton and Grusky. With the 
ground game well established, Dee re
turned to the air and hit sophomore 
tight end Aaron Neal for two receptions 
duringthe drive. Neal caught four passes 
for 58 yards during the game. The drive 
ended with a two-yard touchdown by 
Grusky. With the extra point the rout 
was on, 210.
Catholic took the kickoff on their own 
42 yard line, but were forced to punt 
after three plays. The Cardinals did not 
convert a third down all game. Carnegie 
Mellon took over on their own 24 yard
back and jumped in 
front of the running 
back for the inter
ception and touch
down, said Senior fullback Brian 
Kasperowicz. .
The Tartans scored one more time 
before the end of the first half. The 
scoring drive was set up after Catholic 
fumbled on a fake punt attempt and lost 
the ball on downs. Dee completed passes 
to Grusky and Neal. The Neal reception 
was a 26-yard strike which brought the 
ball to the Catholic one yard line. Grusky 
scored his second touchdown with 1:37 
left in the second half. The Tartans took 
a 35-0 lead into halftime.
The Tartans returned in the second

45-yard drive.
The final Tartan score came late in the 
third quarter on a 21-yard touchdown 
reception by junior halfback Nick Bush 
from Neiss.
We coach the freshmen and second 
offense just as hard, maybe harder, than 
the first team. I just want them to be 
better. You expect them to be perfect on 
every play, but nobody is, so you keep 
practicing. I am very happy with the 
second offense and the freshmen, said
teams, but its up to the [South Region] 
Committee to make the decision. Emory 
and Henry won over Ferrum, who are 
ranked ninth in the South, and Moravian 
won big. We will just have to wait and 
see, said Lackner.
The Tartans close out the regular sea
son with a home game against UAA foe 
Case Western Reserve University, 
what has become known as the Aca
demic Bowl, on November 13 with a 1:30 
pm kickoff at Gesling Stadium.

his year Halloween was more than dressing up in cos 
tume and eating candy. Instead, students enhanced the 
Halloween spirit by attending events across campus. 
In the chemistry lab of Doherty Hall last Wednesday, the 
irst Halloween event was held. Throughout the day, students 
eated their own slime in the lab, and then in the afternoon there 
was a small party for the chemistry students. Everyone stood around 
ftheir lab coats and safety goggles in a darkened room eating 
hee.se puffs while admiring the severed limbs, skulls, and various 
niitilated animals that adorned the countertops and tables. It 
^asnt exactly a scary scene, but Joseph Sapienza, the manager of 
he undergraduate storeroom, helped with the decorations and said 
\ a few foreign students had never celebrated Halloween and 
iould not understand such bizarre rituals.
On Thursday evening, several creative writing majors paid tribute 
to Halloween at the Pterodactyl Speedway literary reading in 
Scotland Yard. Lynne Powell, senior English major, caught the 
audiences attention immediately as she walked around in her 
heels, leather suit, and low-cut bustier, topped off with a 
lerifagram and a dog collar around her neck. Led to the podium on 
leash, she worked the crowd as she read a poem in the spirit of 
HK; Powell said later, [I saw] some shocked faces out there.
, '.-Rebecca Livingstons play about a Salem witch trial changed shock 
to laughter as her characters were humorously brought to life. 
,ivingston, a senior English major, wrote about a woman charged 
with committing the unmentionable sins of learned sorcery, heresy, 
devil worshipping, the killing and consumption of infants, attending 
the sabbat, copulation with Satan, and witchcraft.
Taking this type of evil a bit more seriously, Bryan Lasley, also a 
senior English major, continued to hold the audiences attention as 
e read from Aliester Crowleys Book of Lies, accompanied by Oliver 
"Goblinsticks Kollar. Lesley chose this reading since it had more to 
do with Halloween because of the. Satanic and occult overtones.
I Other readings included poems about Halloween violence, a trib
ute to Princess Leias buns of steel, and a story about a young mans 
love affair with a woman committed to a sanitarium for her cleaning 
obsession. This variety of readings covered all of Halloweens asypects: humor, fun, fright, violence, evil, and unpredictability.
Along the lines of tradition, many other Halloween events on 
^ampus included concerts, scary movies, costume parties, pumpkin 
:arving, and haunted houses. Scotchn Soda invaded the basement 
of Margaret Morrison for a couple of nights for their Chamber of 
Spirits. The many scenes depicting women mutilating men were 
quite unnerving, but the true fear came at the end as various people 
rand creatures jumped out of dark corners, blocking the exit.
For the faint of heart, or for those.interested more in celebrating 
the arrival of autumn rather than Halloween itself, there were other 
activities available such as hayrides, bonfires, and pumpkin picking 
sponsored by Residence life and Pittsburgh Horizons. With the 
j^ariety of events and activities to chose from, there was certainly 
something for everyone this Halloween.Juliana Min, sophomore industrial management major, carves her pumpkin on the Cut on Friday afternoon.

fiiiiel director visits campus
fc LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Features EditorIII'
1 This past week, Richard M. 
nJoel, the interaational director 
VpB nai B rith Hillel, was in 
^Pittsburgh and on campus to 
#eet with representatives from 
'Student Affairs. During 
; short stay here, he 
jnade time to comment 
on the current goals and 
' purposes of Hillel, as 
well as what it means to 
"kg Jewish today.
' fiillel is a campus or
ganization for Jewish 
life. Affiliated with 105 
, college campuses across 
tfte nation, the organi
zation was founded by 
'the University of Illinois 
Jin 1923. Aside from of
fering Shabbat services,
|ysher foods, and holijtyy observances, other 
<$pial, educational, and 
^pijltural programs are 
.peered to make Hillel 
jbipre than just a reli'gipus group.
"J 1Hillel is an organiza
tion which provokes and cata
lyzes Jewish life for the campus 
constituency, says Joel. Our 
ggal is to ignite a Jewish conji^ction and explore Jewish is^es, but we are not a club. 
piJ^iel believes students dont join 
hillel but rather search it out to 
fulfill their individual beliefs. 
"iHillel is a place where stu
dents find family, explore issues, ideas, dreams, and visions, 
and feel a connection through 
"other Jewish students.
 Hillel is moving to become a
place where Jewish life grows out 
of, says Rabbi Art Donsky of 
Hillel. We are not an instiution 
or a synagogue but a connection 
for Jewish students.
Most importantly, Hillel exists 
to help students gain a sense of 
Jewish identity. Students may

need to discover for themselves 
what it means to be Jewish, and 
in a multicultural environment 
such as college, beliefs may be 
challenged daily. In a mass soci
ety, most young kids do not know 
their identity. For most, it is their 
first time away from home with
out their parents to guide their 
faith. They are trying to mirror 
what they know from home but 
find themselves in this giant melt
ing pot and realize they do not 
really know about their 
Jewishness, says Joel.
Joel is working to reinvest 
and recreate Hillel; to create 
an inviting and unified coali
tion. He hopes to help stu
dents to define their own iden
tity in a rich and diverse com
munity. Its hard to be Jewish 
when everyone has different 
definitions of what that 
term means. There are 
no Jewish role models. 
We have such an oppor
tunity for integration 
and understanding but 
must respect individu
alism, says Joel. So 
many things can color 
Jewish life  the danc
ing, the music, the ba
gels, the sex.... [Jewish 
people] have a sense of 
pride in what theyre 
part of. We must all be 
renaissance people and 
live action-oriented 
lifestyles.
Currently, Hillel is 
looking to broaden its 
base and fortify a loca
tion on campus to bet
ter satisfy student 
needs. With the current 
office located on North Craig 
Street in Oakland for both 
CMU and Pitt students, Joel 
hopes to find a more central 
location on campus to make 
meetings easier for students 
and make the organizations 
affiliation with Carnegie 
Mellon stronger. Weve just 
begun the process of exploring 
with the University how to 
build a stronger unity, says 
Joel. Were looking to expand 
services and improve the mo
saic of life here.
Symposium addresses stress
By DANEELLA TOPOL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
How can I keep from getting 
sick all of the time? was the topic 
of this years Fall Health Sympo
sium. The Symposium, run by 
the Doctors of Carnegie, was held 
on Tuesday, October 26, in Wean 
Hall. Guest speakers Dr. Sheldon 
A. Cohen, professor of psychol
ogy, Dr. Ralph Jacobs, and Dr. 
Karen Vargo, both physicians for 
Health Services, addressed the 
following issues, re
spectively: Can stress 
affect the immune sys
tem? , How can I keep 
from getting sick all 
the time?, and What 
constitutes a healthy 
lifestyle? We felt 
that maintaining 
health while being 
under stress is an is
sue which concerns all ____________
students, says Sonika Bhatnagar, junior chemis
try major and chair of the sympo
sium.
According to Cohen, the more 
stress in a students life, the more 
susceptible that student will be 
to developing a cold. Students 
under pressure often spend more 
time with each other, and there
fore, the possibility of catching a 
cold from someone else is as prob
able as independently develop
ing a cold. In many cases, a cold 
will immediately follow a stress
ful event. I feel sick after I write 
a long story. I feel drained and 
sick, says junior English major 
Brock Hamlin. Choli Lightfoot, 
sophomore architect, agrees with 
Hamlin, I always get sick right
after a major project is due. I will 
stay up all weekend, and when I 
finally get to rest my body seems 
to say, okay, we have time now, 
lets get sick. 
Since stress is often what causes 
bad health, Jacobs and Vargo 
addressed the issue of how to 
reduce stress, thereby reducing 
ones susceptibility to becoming 
sick. Jacobs suggested taking 20 
minutes a day to meditate or ex
ercise, eating and sleeping at 
regular times, keeping ones opEveryone needs to stress to stay 
alive. The question is: At what 
point does this stress become 
nonproductive and destructive?

Health Center Director
tions open, setting realistic goals, 
maintaining goal flexibility, and 
breaking tasks to be done into 
smaller, more manageable, steps. 
Vargo added that the manner in 
which one keeps ones room and 
washing ones hands are also key 
to maintaining good health.
To some students, however, 
Jacobs and Vargos suggestions 
are impossible to follow. The 
schedule is such, in the Drama 
Department, that its almost im
possible to stay healthy, says 
Kristin Sentman, junior drama 
major. Ferdi Mack, sophomore 
electrical and computer engineer 
says, They all say eat healthy, 
get more sleep, and dont be 
stressed out. But those are the
same things that are so hard to 
do around here.
To Anita Barkin, director of 
Health Services, finding time to 
reduce stress is not as impossible 
as it seems. Exercise is very im
portant in reducing stress. Stu
dents often tell me they have no 
time to exercise. But what makes 
more sense? Sitting at your desk 
for an hour being nonproductive 
and under stress or exercising for
15-20 minutes and then return
ing to your desk and being pro
ductive for a 
half an hour? 
For some, 
staying healthy 
is not an issue. 
I havent en
countered any 
rampant prob
lems with my 
health since I 
have been here. 
There is an opportunity to eat 
healthy if you want to, says Joe 
Deer, first-year graduate direc
tor. I dont take any sort of pills 
at all, I eat whatever I want, and 
I bike sometimes, and Im never 
sick. I guess I just magically stay 
healthy, says Andrew Byler, 
sophomore civil engineer.
Most students, however, are not 
as fortunate in maintaining good 
health during stressful times. 
Students who we see [at Health 
Services] often say that they have 
been under a lot of stress. It is a 
very common comment, says 
Barkin. Stress is good to a point. 
Everyone needs to stress to stay 
alive. The question is: At what 
point does this stress become non
productive and destructive?
jierstories discusses womens opportunities
do
STbRIES, from page L2
5^trre in the proposal and qualifiers stage, 
finishing your dissertation, or waiting for ten
ure.
iJaSfiiere is a constant tension about taking on 
l^^ssue. For example, when no provisions are 
ma&e in academia for women with young chil
dren  a woman must decide between paying 
the professional costs of taking on those issues, 
or deciding not to publicly take on these issues 
and paying the personal price, said Maryellen 
Kelley, associate professor in the Heinz School.
And you have to decide if youre going to take 
a public or private route in solving these prob
lems, said one participant of the conference.
Professor of English Linda Flower, Lazarus,
\ Lara Wolfson, PhD candidate in statistics, and 
others stressed the importance of sharing prob
lems with other womenwith fellow graduate 
students and faculty. Sometimes, a senior fac
ulty member is in a better position to address a 
graduate womans problem for her. In other 
^ instances, not being in a posi
tion of power is the best posi
tion from which to advocate an 
issue, said Flower.
Sometimes were in a posi
tion to do for others what we 
cant do for ourselves, said 
Lazarus.
Wolfson encouraged everyone
not to keep their problems to _________________
themselves; to realize that other 
graduate women are experiencing problems, 
too. When you work together, you rid yourself 
of the burden of coming up with a solution by 
yourself, of being the bad guy,  said Wolfson. 
When one womans problem becomes other 
womens problems, then it becomes a visible 
issue.
The conference also discussed the difficulty 
in making issues visible outside the depart
ment, as womens issues. Because each depart
ment is so different, and perhaps isolated, from 
the other, the administration has decentral
ized graduate program responsibilities to the 
departmental level. Generalizing womens ex
periences, then, from the departmental to a 
wider level is nearly impossible. Just as each 
department is different, so too is its climate for 
women. How each department is treated by the 
university differs. The departments that are 
made up mostly of women are frequently conl sidered lower status and are lower-paid, said 
I Laurie Weingart, assistant professor of indus
trial administration, GSIA.
The reason people perceive that it is 
easier for women graduate students in 
English and history is because in these 
disciplines, we can use gender as an ana
lytical tool in our work. Women in science 
and engineering may not so easily per
ceive their problems as womens issues, 
said Trost.
Sharing these problems across depart
ments and making womens issues visible 
at the university level is an important 
goal of the Womens Conference.
In introductory and closing panels, fac
ulty and graduate students shared what 
they learned from their experiences in 
academia:
Assistant professor of physics Sara 
Majetich, in the opening panel, was the 
first but not the only one at the conference 
to advise women that telling a colleague, 
or group of colleagues, what they said was
"There's a perception among men that 
women dont have a sense of humor. We

I dont have, nor have I ever had, a recipe for 
cranberry muffins.
Theres a perception among men that 
women dont have a sense of humor. We do 
its just different from mens, Majetich said.
Indira Nair, associate department head 
and associate professor of engineering and 
public policy, spoke about boundaries  the 
importance of knowing where ones core is. 
Your core, your spirit, is your essence; the 
questions you have about everything around 
you is your existence. Always remember to 
distinguish between the two, and never lose 
your sense of either, said Nair.
Nair described a'survival packet of items 
for graduate women to always remember: to 
make priorities; to choose which battles to 
fight, or causes to stand up for because some 
battles will not be worth fighting at a par
ticular time in your life; to know your values 
and not let anyone touch them. Above all, 
never suspect yourself, 
said Nair, who pointed out 
Freud as an example of who 
or what can make us sus
pect ourselves. But remem
ber that conditioning is a 
part of ones existence, not 
essence, said Nair. If 
somone presumes to know 
you better than you know 
yourself, simply remember 
that you know yourself better.
It took me a long time to figure out what 
this means, but now I do know, said Nair. 
When you tjiink youre powerless, when 
everything is heaped on you, remember that 
people are watching you to see what you will 
do, and you hurt them by being powerless. 
Other events are the Womens Speakers 
Series, new this year, continuing through
out this semester and the next, and by the 
University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon; for a second year, the Students of 
Color Retreat, in March; the Faculty Womens 
Breakfast, which has been going on for three 
years; and for the first time, the Students of 
Color evening programs. The Graduate Stu
dent Seminar Series is in its fourth year.
offensive, then listing to reasons why is 
rarely an effective approach, because it 
does not change behavior. Instead, one 
has to choose more creative ways to ex
press discomfort or outrage.
There is the story, Majetich said, about 
a group of graduate students in the early 
phase of their program who found that the 
job of serving cookies at department func
tions had been casually but insistently 
delegated to them. Complaining about the 
indignance would have accomplished little, 
so the students decided to purchase col
ored dog biscuits, coat them with icing and 
serve  to the absolute pleasure of the 
scientists.
Confessing that no physicist can give a 
presentation without an overhead and 
transparencies, Majetich also displayed a For more information on any of these proseries of cartoonists drawings, one of which grams, contact Kathleen Minadeo Johnson,

Amanda Miller redefines 'modern dance
be focused. But in this raucous dance, 
that was part of the fun. Im not sure 
exactly why Miller chose the name 
Pretty Ugly for her company, but I ani 
sure why it was chosen for this piece  
the male dancers were wearing some 
very ugly shirts (more evidence of Millers 
light-hearted approach to dance).
There were a couple of things going on 
during this piece that Im not sure were 
part of the performance: the house lights 
went on and off a few times, and two 
pieces of the set were knocked over by 
dancers. I wonder at the intentionality 
of these events, but part of the joy of 
modern dance is that it probably doesnt 
matter.
The Pretty Ugly Dance company is a 
new company composed of dancers Miller 
has worked with in the past. She has 
been doing choreography for Ballet 
Frankfurt for several years and many of 
the dancers come from that company or 
other European dance companies. Ap
parently, the company does not have a 
permanent home base or a permanent 
company of dancers.
The place and performers change ac
cording to who commissions their work. 
Miller says of her work, When people 
see me move they dont recognize classi-' 
cal movements, although they do recog
nize classical lines and forms. I invert 
everything. Including conventions of 
dance like the men are always taller 
than the women, which isnt at all trufe 
for Pretty Ugly.
Miller breaks away from traditional1 
ballet, but not so far away that her; 
choreography loses the beauty of that* 
traditional dance form.
Pretty Ugly Dance Company is mod
ern dance for those who are put off by the 
foreigness of most modern dance. They 
are pushing the envelope without break
ing the seal.
Fearless more than fel-good flick
By JENNIFER TURNER
Tartan Staffwriter
Fearless is one of the better movies youll see this year. It stars Jeff 
Bridges and Rosie Perez as two airplane crash survivors who help 
each other get on with their lives after the accident.
The film begins immediately after the crash. Max Stein (Bridges) 
is walking through a smoking corn field carrying a baby and leading 
a young boy by the hand. Almost immediately, we learn that Max has 
rescued both children from the crash. He hands the boy over to 
rescue officials, but the boy refuses to leave .and has to be pulled away 
from Max. Max then goes in search of the babys mother and 
witnesses a tearful reunion. Meanwhile, at the site of the crash,
Carla Rodrigo (Perez) straggles with firefighters, screaming that 
her son is still on the plane. The firefighters resolutely carry her 
away as she watches, horrified, the plane burst into flames.
Max leaves the scene of the accident in a euphoric daze, unable to 
believe that he is still alive. Days later, the airline tracks him down 
to a roadside motel with the help of the FBI. They originally offer him 
train tickets home, but he insists on first-class plane tickets. On 
board, a psychiatrist, Dr. Bill Perlman (John Turturro), arrives to 
help him through the traumatic after-effects of the crash. Max feels 
that he is now invulnerable and doesnt avail himself of the 
psychiatrists help.
Three months later, in desperation, Dr. Perlman introduces Max 
to Carla. While Max is euphoric and feeling more alive than he has 
ever felt, Carla is almost catatonic and emotionally dead. She only 
gets out of bed to go to church to pray for the soul of her son. Dr.
Perlman feels that both victims are beyond his reach and the only 
solution he can come up with is to introduce them and see if they can 
help each other. During this time, Byron (Daniel Cerny), the boy Max 
saved, tracks him down and becomes a sort 
of surrogate son of Maxs. In a sense, Carla 
and Byron begin to take the place of Maxs 
wife and son. Having saved Carla and Byron 
once, Max feels compelled to save them again.
While Fearless focuses on two characters,
Max and Carla, and in a lesser way on Byron, 
it is really the story of Max. He is unable to 
come down to earth and deal with his life 
after looking death in the face and accepting 
it. After the accident, he performs a series of 
suicidal stunts and nearly misses killing 
himself each time. These acts give him, in a 
measure, the same feeling he experienced 
right before the crash.
Throughout the movie, Max is shown in a 
human light, even though he views himself 
as indestructible. Others regard him as a 
hero for having saved their lives, but he is 
shown as being just like everyone else: try
ing to put his narrow brush with death into 
a human perspective.
To counterbalance the often dark aspects 
of the movie are the scenes between Max and 
his lawyer (Tom Hulce). This movie could 
have easily gone overboard, very quickly, 
but the moments of pathos are intermingled 
with much-needed comic relief. The scenes 
between Max and his lawyer are all funny, 
but in a human, everyday life sort of way.
And even these scenes are somehow turned Isabella RoselHni and Jeff Bridges star in Fearless.
around to show the tragic, and often ironic, turns of life.
The acting in Fearless is superb. Isabella Rossellini delivers a 
flawless performance as Maxs wife. She makes us feel for her, even 
as we understand the reasons why Max has difficulty in confiding in 
her. She shows us her pain and frustration as she tries to force Max 
to let her into his new world.
Bridges is perfect as the sardonic one minute, jaded the next, Max 
Stein. His scenes flow back and forth seamlessly and nothing seems 
out of place.
And last, but certainly not least, Perez gave the role of Carla; 
Rodrigo 100 percent. She makes you want to laugh and cry at the; 
same time, not knowing which reaction would be the more appropri
ate one.
There were only a few bad things about this movie. I mention them 
not because they were particularly heinous crimes in film-making, 
but because they detracted somewhat from the movie. The first 
problem was some of the cinematography. At times it was grainy or! 
blurry. I dont know whether it was intended or the result of bad 
camera work. In the first instance, it didnt have its intended effect.'. 
In the second instance, it was just sloppy work.
The second detraction was the ending. I thought the ending was a 
little saccharin and contrived for such a film. It dealt with all the. 
issues that the movie brought up and tied up most of the loose ends,' 
but to put it plainly, it was dumb.
Lastly, Byron disappears about halfway through the movie and we; 
never see him again. He isnt a major character, but he is of. 
significant importance to make us wonder, What happened to him?
Overall, I definitely think this movie worth seeing. It isnt feel-, 
good, it has a fair amount of action, but it also makes you think; it. 
makes you feel. And that cant be all bad.
Of five stars, I give the movie four-and-a-half.

Amanda Millers Pretty Ugly Dance 
Company performed Saturday night at 
the Fulton Theater. They performed four 
pieces: St. Nick; Artos Books; Night, 
By Itself; and Pretty Ugly. Now, Im 
not a fan of the term modern dance 
because, for me, it has negative connota
tions of people dressed in black, rolling 
around on the floor, and 
slinging their arms 
around to some weird 
music. Pretty Ugly is defi
nitely a modern dance 
company, but I was re
lieved to discover that 
aimless arm slinging was 
kept to a minimum.
St. Nick, the first 
piece, was danced by 
Miller and Michael 
Schumacher. The stage 
and costumes were of 
minimal design but 
worked rather well for the 
piece. The music was a 
strange collage that 
Miller created from mod
em composers and Bach, 
mixed in with some spo
ken words. The dance felt 
/ery narrative; I was be
ing told a story about men 
and women and how they 
^interact. The piece on the 
-hole was slow, but I ap
preciated seeing a man 
j$imp and be caught be a 
;i;#oman, instead of the 
Mother way around. A film 
^projector came on at one 
point. The light from it 
created some interesting 
effects, with the dancers 
shadows and the dancers
themselves, but for the most part, this 
was certainly not the strongest nor most 
innovative piece.
The same could be said for Artos 
Books. Three other dancers and Miller 
performed this interesting, but quiet, 
piece. Millers dance roots are in ballet, 
and that was very obvious in the chore
ography here.
It seemed to be an exercise in the 
synchronicity that embodies traditional
ballet, but the dancers would occasion
ally burst through the grid that had 
been artificially imposed on them. Struc
ture and the strenuous precision of bal
letic movement would reign for a while, 
until Millers sense of humor would al
low the dance to break into controlled 
chaos.
Pretty Ugly is best at its most frantic. 
Though Night, By Itself was arguably 
the most beautiful piece, I felt it was too
Amanda Millers Pretty Ugly Dance Company performed

courtesy of Pittsburgh Dance Council 
their entertaining form of modern dance^Saturday night at
atmospheric. Night, By Itself was the 
newest piece performed, commissioned 
by the Wexner Center for the Arts in 
Ohio where the company is in residency 
this year. Miller says it was inspired by 
the writings of Edmund Jabes, an Egyptian-born Jewish writer who worked in 
Paris until his death in 1991.
The music was certainly fitting for 
the feel of the piece. It was composed by 
John Zorn, king of New York avantnoise, and was quite 
ethereal. The stage was 
decorated with inflat
able sculptures de
signed by artist Cara 
Perlman. I was a little 
disappointed in the 
sculptures, actually. 
They were mildly in
teresting: one looked 
like the bones of a foot, 
but one reminded me of 
that early-80s cartoon 
character the
Schmoo. But com
plaints aside, it was a 
beautiful piece, with 
some very strange cho
reography.
Now we get to what I 
thought was the best 
part: the companys sig
nature piece, Pretty 
Ugly. There was some 
element of slapstick hu
mor in every piece per
formed, but Pretty 
Ugly was the most con
sistently amusing, ex
citing, and interesting.
I even liked the arm 
slinging. Miller makes 
use of the entire stage, 
so much so that it is 
often confusing where 
ones attention should
New Dylan still strong
By JOHN BIGGS
 Tartan Staffwriter
 Bob Dylan is by far one of the best songwriters to come around
 the pike in the 1960s that still is able to reach the strength and
5 clarity evident in those turbulent times. In a way, I respect
I Dylan to the point of deification. Dylan has parallelled my life 
I.' for the past few years and shaped a lot of what I believe and how 
; I express myself.
World Gone Wrong, his latest release, is a series of blues and 
k folk covers that all deal with the idea of a world gone wrong, 
which in Dylans eyes is a frightening and enchanting place.
| Dylan is not a romantic singer, and these songs are not roman tic. You know you are in for something on the low side when on
S the cover you see him in a top hat in front of a strangely askew 
J picture. The inner photo is even more interesting: a yellowshaded picture of Bob in a Stetson hat looking as if the weight 
\ of the world were on his shoulders. And, in the jacket, there are
I his comments on the songs, something he has never done before. 
The first song is World Gone Wrong, written by Blind Willie 
McTell, an early blues guitarists of some acclaim. This song 
t- ponders the problems of the modern world through the voice of 
' what sounds like a field hand calling in after work across the 
dooryard. Thats Dylan. Love Henry and Ragged & Dirty are 
 two old folk ballads that deal with lost beauty. If you would kill 
..your own true love/Youd kill a little bird like me. cries a parrot 
in Love Henry, and there you hear Dylan watching beauty die 
. with the last lines of Ragged & Dirty. Blood In My Eyes is a 
' fast song sung slow. Recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks, it is a 
mans lament over losing his money to a prostitute. The particuPlease see DYLAN, page L10

Image releases long-awaited Union #2
C Fm sure youve all heard the expres
sion Good things come to those who 
wait. After about a year or so of reading 
Image comics I think they should adopt 
; this as their slogan. Although this might 
;; sound a bit sarcastic, I mean it as a 
; compliment. The frustration that builds 
up when I have to wait for a book for 
weeks (or even months) disappears as 
soon as I see the great piece of work in 
. my hands. My most recent experience 
with this has been with Union issue #2.
When I saw the first issue I had been 
 a bit wary about buying it since I had no 
; idea who Union was other than a new 
 superhero with a conscience. This dis; turbed me a little because when I think 
of heroes with consciences I think of 
Marvels Daredevil who really annoys 
me with his habit of turning criminals in 
for the system to release them in a few 
months. Also, Union #1 had one of those 
'ihfamous embossed $2.50 covers, which 
didnt increase my chances of purchas
ing it any. But, there werent many other 
Books to buy at the time, and I had a 
-little extra cash so I decided to go for it. 
Now, I think the purchase of Union #1 
was one of the best risks Ive ever taken 
in my 11 years of collecting comics.It 
really surprised me, and its been a long 
time since Ive been this excited about a 
comic.
For the past two months I have gone to 
buy comics each week hoping that it 
would finally be the week Union #2 
would be out. Finally, this past Wednes
day was the answer to my prayers. Prob
ably the reason I like this book so much 
is the writing. Excluding Spawn, its the 
best written Image book. Co-created by
Comic Book Chronicles
By Jason And rack i
Jim Lee and Mike Heisler (the writer of 
Union), The character of Ohm an (Union) 
is one of the most unique characters to 
come along since Paul Chadwicks Con
crete. Strangely enough Heisler, best 
known as the letterer on Wild C.A.T.S 
and Cyberforce for Image, graduated in 
1986 from Carnegie Mellons art depart
ment. Although 
I read in an in
terview that 
Heisler isnt too 
sure of his writ
ing talents, and 
he only wrote 
the story be
cause he was co
erced into it by 
Lee and Marc 
Silvestri I 
found nothing 
unsure in these 
first two issues 
of the four-issue 
limited series.
Im glad Heisler 
is now filling the 
pages of a book 
with his own 
words rather 
than someone 
elses.
Both the covers and interior art are by 
Mark Texeira, formerly of The Punisher 
and Ghost Rider from Marvel. Even 
though Texeiras style can be a bit 
scratchy at times, I feel it suits this book 
well. This style really suits Unions emo
tions, especially in the fourth panel of 
page 13 of issue #2. Both covers have 
also been excellent, especially #2 with 
its background skyline of New York City.

Mental illness has warning signs, too.
Withdrawal from social activities. Excessive anger.
These could be the first warning signs of a mental illness. 
Unfortunately, most of us don't recognize the signs.
Which is tragic. Because mental illness can be treated.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  1 November 1993
Thursday, November 4Sid and Nancy
Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb star in the 1986 
British release, Sid and Nancy. Alex Cox directs 
this, a depressing yet intense and compelling film 
about the self-destructive and weird relationship 
between music star Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols 
and American groupie, Nancy Spungen.
Oldman and Webb have fine performances in 
this film. Their characters are so convincing that 
its hard to walk away from the movie and believe 
that theyre not really Sid and Nancy. Cox also 
does an excellent job directing this movie in such 
a way that it is difficult to keep in mind that the 
film is fiction, not fact. The combination of real
ism and fantasy makes for a fascinating flick.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, November 5Poetic Justice
Janet Jackson makes her big screen debut in 
director John Singletons second film, Poetic Justice. Jackson plays a single, young beautician 
trying to pull the pieces of her life together after 
her boyfriend is killed in a gang shooting.
A friend and co-worker of Jackson tries to lift 
her spirits and get her out of the house again. She 
convinces Jackson to take a road trip with her, 
her boyfriend, and her boyfriends friend (who is 
a mailman) in a U.S. Postal mail truck. Personali
ties clash and most of the trip is a huge disaster, 
but towards the end of the movie, romance sparks 
between Jackson and the mailman.
After starling in the television show .Fame and 
all of her music videos, Jackson seems like a 
natural on screen. Although the plot of Poetic 
Justice isnt very compelling, Im sure Jackson 
fans wouldnt mind seeing the movie simply to 
watch her for a couple of hours on screen and up 
close. Afew songs on Jacksons new album, Janet, 
are also featured in the movie.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, November 6Alien
This 1979 film is a classic sci-fi terror loosely 
based on the book It! The Terror From Beyond 
Space. Sigourney Weaver stars as a crew member 
of a commercial spacecraft that is wreaked and 
tortured by a horrible encounter with a mon
strous alien.
Alien is an action packed thriller with enough 
slime, gore, and violence to make weaker audi
ence members squirm in their seats.
If science fiction is not your forte, however, you 
may still consider sitting through Alien just to get 
a glimpse of its Oscar winning special effects.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Sunday, November 7The Amazing Colossal Man
The effects of an atomic bomb explosion causes 
a surviving army officer to grow to abnormal and 
enormous porportion.
Standing at 60 feet tall, the officer invades Las 
Vegas, creating havoc in the city and panic around 
the country.
Just another mobster movie you say? But since 
it is a 1957 release and it is followed by a sequel, 
War of the Colossal Beast, how bad could it be?
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

13th Gen, Slackers, Generation X, Baby Busters, everyone-inAmerica-under-the-age-of-thirty. If you tit into this last category, you fit 
into each and every one before it. You are the Mr. Ed of the human 
world. You don't have the right pedigree to get a real generational title like 
Baby Boomer.' 'Generation X' is my personal favorite; ifs like the ubiquitous 
constant in calculus. It's probably there, so you have to count it into the 
equation, but you dont know exactly what it is or why its there.

 Alfred North Whitehead, An Introduction to Mathematics
Writing about Generation X from within Generation X is like asking Mr. Ed if 
he is still a horse, and if so, would he like to speak for all of horse-dom. Of 
course he would like to think he is still a horse. And, if there's a mirror in the 
barn, he can tell, physically, that hes a horse. But mentally, can he speak for 
horses that can't speak for themselves or can he merely be an advocate? Can 
he even be an advocate? Being a member of Generation X, will I, with a 
computer on my desk and a newspaper waiting to print whatever I write, 
presume to speak for a group that has been told it cant or wont speak for 
itself? No. I speak for me and me alone. If someone else agrees or disagrees, 
great. Let him or her write it or speak it or spray paint it on the sidewalk and 
maybe Generation X will become The-First-Generation-That-Said-What-ltThought. Besides, it sorts of defeats the point to speak for a generation that 
cant speak for itself when you want to say it can.
Researchers in the social sciences have talked a lot about what makes up 
identity and how we get the materials to build a persona. Most of these people 
however, did not spend their identity-forming years with MTV, The Brady

tv should be the flagship of post modernism, fractured, non-linear, disjointed.
But, everyone talks about MTV like it's to blame for something. MTV is post 
modernism, identity resulting from having no singular identity. MTV serves so 
many because it is no singular thing. It is whatever its viewer wants. On the deck 
of that boat stands Generation X, fractured, non-linear, disjointed  post mod
ernism incarnate. MTV creates its identity from opposition. It is not sight or 
sound, but sight and sound, and not one breed of the two but several breeds  
rap, R&B, hip hop, pop, grunge, and old fashioned rock and roll. It is ironic, or

The new attorney general is saying that television and film is bad for us young people. It makes us do things. It makes us 
crazy. It makes us decide to see how big our balls are by laying down on the yellow line in the middle of the highway. Its great 
that television and the silver screen are so damned powerful. I do have one question though. If The Program, Cops, and90210can make so many of us  Generation X  more stupid, violent, and sex-starved, why didn't Leave It to 
Beaver and our Baby Boomer parents make us more loving?
The Brady Bunch has got to be the most ridiculous thing that ever aired on television. Widower with lots of kids falls in 
love with widow with lots of kids and they all live happily ever after with a live in maid whos never bitter about being the victim 
of stupid pranks that's the basic plot. That's what we call the Brady Bunch. Thats what we call the model for the Baby 
Boomer-Generation X family.
Style in subculture is, then, pregnant with significance. Its transformations go i 
against nature, interrupting the process of normalization. As such, they are gestures, 
movements towards a speech which offends the silent majority, which challenges the prin- I 
ciple of unity and cohesion, which contradicts the myth of consensus.

The Walkman is portable MTV. With or without digital tuning and Dolby noise reduction, it is the complete fmji

Hegemony, in its most oversimplified form, is common sense. In those terms, it is hard to question. Why 
wouldn't Generation X want to gain personal and material satisfaction? Trying to find absolutes is like swimming to 
shore from the middle of the ocean, except that there is no shore, and the entire trip has to be made under water. The only 
signposts are other swimmers whose own signposts are you. For Generation X  the signposts  the other swimmers are 
either floating in the seaweed or saying they don't know how to swim.

When I started writing this, I thought I would know what I was writing about. Then it started changing. I started 
stealing other people's quotations. I started grabbing more and more because I didn't kno w what to say myself, because I 
didn't know what to say about myself and my generation, Generation X. There are too many questions to list. There are too 
many questions to even begin to think about starting to come up with answers. Questions, they are Generation X.

Trendy seventeen-year old club kids. Confused, ignorant ecstacy addicts 
wearing themselves and their bodies out on parties that last two days. DJs 
that spend nine-and-a-half dollars for 12-inch singles. Sunny, cliched 
platitudes about positivity and open-mindedness, spoken by people who 
dare not leave their herd.
Such phenomenon are characteristic of the rave scene." What-is most 
disturbing/amusing about this techno" music is the name: with typical 
chutzpah, ravers refer to such a narrow band of the possibilities of music 
that can be created with electronics and synthesizers (techno"logy) in 
calling their music techno" that this writer cannot help but keep the term 
in quotes throughout the remainder of this essay in an deliberate show of 
disrespect.
Arrogance extended: ravers call this form of music "experimental," or. 
worse, a "unique mixture of house and new age! Most of these people, 
were you to drop the names of the most obvious experimental bands 
around them (such as Negativland or wouldn't you know Illusion of 
Safety), would not know what you are talking about. Many are not even 
aware of well-known late 80s Wax Trax bands like 1000 Homo DJs, let 
alone genres that are not experimental. Like sheep, ravers do what their 
friends do, listen to music that their friends listen to again, staying within 
the herd at all times.
It is important to point out the similarities between the naive youth hippie 
culture that surrounds this new form of music and hippie cultures of years 
past. Hippie culture like techno" culture today snubbed individual 
creativity in music in favor of cheap slogans, expensive drugs, group 
think, and an unwillingness to explore anything outside of the narrowly 
defined culture. Techno culture is virtually devoid of folk knowledge, 
rhetorical or conceptual questioning or conflict, or. for that matter, content 
itself (besides the revolutionary quality of techno, or the beat). This is 
partially evident through trying to be patient enough to listen to the non
conversations of prominent techno-nerds around campus' (a frustrating, 
empty experience).
Those few sub-genres of techno" that make an attempt to not;be predict
able and boring usually end up becoming squelched by the limiting - 
dynamics of the dubs. The clubs are, in effect, means of socializing : . 
disaffected youth into the dominating culture. (Rave clubs used tc be 
raided, back when t.was thought that such places were dangerous.)

When I think of the role models presented 
to me as a little girl, the list doesn't look very - 
promising: Barbie, Marcia Brady, the Bionic 
Woman, Bo Derek, any one of Charlies Angels  
the list could go on and on. Out of this plastic, 
wing-haired mountain of harlots, isnt there some 
feminine savior from my childhood I can look up 
to?
There's Velma from Scooby Doo, but she 
was kind of nerdy. Then there was Wonderwoman, 
with those awesome wrist shields that deflected 
anything that came her way, but she ran around in 
her underwear and couldn't even fly without her 
invisible plane. Laverne and Shirley were cool, but 
they had loser boyfriends and worked in a brewery.
No, the role model for a female of Genera
tion X needs to more than a bikini-clad gal with 
nifty steel jewelry, more than a working girl stuck in 
Milwaukee; she needs mobility, brains, glory, 
beauty, autonomy, and maybe even power over 
the whole galaxy. Yes, it seems the only heroine 
able to meet the standards of the Generation X 
woman is Princess Leia, adventuress of the galaxy
 someone who knows how to use a blaster and 
how to talk back to a big evil guy in a cape.
Princess Leia just wasnt like all the other 
girls. In the first place, she is a princess. It is 
always coo! to be a princess. Princesses could do 
whatever they wanted to do. But Leia was not of 
the usual princess genre. She doesn't just sit 
around in her castle dressing up in costumes and 
ordering people to get her things. Instead, Leia 
wanders the galaxy. She has initiative; she is an 
independent woman out crusading for a cause, and 
no gets in her way.
Princess Leia also seems to be smarter 
and more powerful than any of the other major 
characters in the Star Wars trilogy (save, perhaps, 
Darth Vader). Whenever something goes wrong, it 
is usually because either Luke or Han Solo botch 
things up. In these instances, Leia is often the one 
who takes charge and gets things done right.
One of my favorite scenes from Star Wars 
happens after Luke and Han Solo try to carry out
their ill-organized plan to rescue Leia, and find Hi 
storm troopers on their tail. The guys are shootire 
and missing every other shot they make, and 
they're cornered in a corridor, with seemingly no 
way out. Finally sick of their boorishness, Leia 
takes one of their guns and starts ordering them 
into the vent she has just blasted open. After she 
pushes them inside, she stays in the corridor 
covering for them, hitting every storm trooper she 
aims at. This is always the part when I yell, Go 
Leia! Of course, Han remains outside the vent to 
prove his manhood. Too bad he did not have 
good aim.
In the hierarchical power structure, it's 
obvious that Leia is the most powerful of the 
three. Han Solo is a half-degenerate galactic 
smuggler and Luke, at least when the story starts 
out, is just an adolescent farm hick who likes to 
target womp rats in his spare time.
The only people seen as more powerful 
than Leia in the story are her two fathers  her 
real father Darth Vader and her stepfather, the 
king of Alderon. After her stepfather dies in the 
destruction of Alderon, she is rightful head over 
the commander of the rebel forces, and thus is 
effectively in direct power opposition to the 
Empire. When the Empire is crippled after its 
rulers are destroyed at the end of Return of the 
Jedi, she becomes the power head of the galaxy.
Compared to your average movie hero
ine, Leia is one powerful woman.
And it isnt just an absolute power over 
others like the power held by femme fatales of 
gangster tlicks. Leia has control and power over 
her own life and body. There are very few in
stances where Leia lets herself get pushed 
around by anybody. The best show of this sell- s 
agency is the way she handled men, from meek 
boys like Han and Lando Calrissain. When Lute 
tries to be manly and rescue the poor, helpless 
princess from her cell in the Deathstar, she cuts 
him down to size by commenting on how short hi 
is. In The Empire Strikes Back, when Lando tries 
to put the moves on her, she makes it clear right 
away shes not the type to fall for cheap comeons.
Leia knows how to handle men. She 
manages to get men to fall for her without putting

---------------------------------------------------

jn a come-hither act like most women with power in 
movies do. She doesn't use her sex to gain control 
and manipulate others and she never turns men 
away with her sexual aloofness either. She doesnt 
disdain men entirely, but she could live without them 
.Sshe had to.
Best of all, she knew how to tell a guy off 
when he was being too much of an idiot. The best 
example I can remember of this is in Star Wars after 
Luke, Han Solo, and Leia get out of the trash dump 
3id Han Solo says, If we can just avoid any more 
female advice, we ought to be able to get out of 
here," to which Leia replies Listen. I dont know who 
you are, or where you came from, but from now on, 
you do as I tell you. Okay? Then she pushes 
3iiewbacca aside, calling him a walking carpet, while 
Han just stands there. The steam pours from her 
tightly wound ear-buns.
But we should really be cautious in lauding 
this galactic super-woman so readily; As the wise 
3bi-Wan once said, Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them." Yes, much as I love Leia and her 
wonder-bun hair, I do see some paradox Inherent in 
her construction. Leia may seem to be the perfect 
picture of modern femininity  bright, powerful, in 
control, and even attractive  but there are certainly 
Haws that could make her not all that I've set her up 
to be. Seeing as Star Wars is made in Hollywood, it 
seems such a result would be virtually inevitable.
Leia Is still, above all things, a princess. And 
 s face it, the word princess has certain connota
tions that are just plain unavoidable in the real world. 
Princesses are beautiful and usually spoiled. They 
Wait around in turrets waiting for people to come 
rescue them. They are placed on pedestals and 
suited by men who want to marry them.
Though Leia certainly dispels some of these 
Annotations, there are others she falls right into. She 
ls Presented as rather bossy, like someone who is 
!^ed to getting her own way. She's certainly beautiful 
ar>d pursued by at least one handsome man. She 
9ets herself captured by the Empire and has to wait 
arund on the Deathstar for someone to come rescue 
|er-ln Return of the Jedi, she has to be rescued 
-fain, this time after being made a sort of sick sex 
toy for Jabba to gaze on and lick with his sloth-like 
tongue. Being the woman and the princess of the 
story, it seems that scenes like these were narratively
unavoidable. Han Solo may have been frozen Into a 
statue, but having him dressed up In a thong with a 
collar and chain would simply have been a Holly
wood faux pas.
Although Leia does seem to have the literal 
power throughout most of the story line, exactly how 
much of this power she actually has In truth is a 
pertinent question. When the rebel boys go out to 
risk life and limb to try and destroy the Deathstar, 
Leia can do nothing more than stand around at the 
rebel base and look concerned  kind of like a 
mother figure. She cannot get out there and fly a tie 
fighter, risking her life to do something real.
Leia also can't avoid being that darn 
unavoidable object of the gaze that seems to pop up 
in every Hollywood movie. Her hair is always perfect 
and beautiful, her lipstick always matte finished, her 
clothes always soft and glowing with traditional 
lighting. Not that she isnt allowed to be beautiful 
and powerful, but she still risks losing some of her 
power to the fact that she's always being placed as 
a beautiful woman in front of the camera.
But, all in all, even today, Lela's still one of 
the most positive female roles to come out of 
Hollywood movies. The fact that she appeared right 
during my formative years may have something to 
do with this, but I consider myself lucky to have 
such an intriguing female role out there to think 
about. Even today, over 10 years after her first 
appearance, her character seems to hold pertinence 
to the struggles women face today. I say this 
because I feel, galaxies aside, Leia seems to almost 
be the epitome of what the modern woman could 
be. She still has problems to work out, but, over all, 
she ends up doing pretty damn well for herself.
Best of all, I feel confident that Leia would 
never sit around waiting for some guy to come 
marry her so she could settle down into queendom 
doing nothing but making little baby Leias. Even 
though she gets together with Han at the end of the 
trilogy, they don't make wedding arrangements, and 
the future still is uncertain. They dont settle down in 
a white house with a picket fence, and nothing 
about Leia or Han makes us think they ever will.
Leia is the modern mobile woman. And, unlike most 
other blockbuster Hollywood movies, shes not 
required to make a choice; She can have her cake 
and eat it too.

America Television
On May 19, 1992, Vice-President Dan Quayle blamed 
the Los Angeles riots on'a breakdown of American 
family values, and accused the prime-time television 
show Murphy Brown of contributing to the moral decay 
of moral values by making a heroine out of a single 
mother. He said that the lead character Murphy Brown 
played by Candice Bergen, [mocks] the importance of 
fathers by bearing a child alone, and calling it just 
another lifestyle choice' (Jehl, 1)." The birth episode 
of Murphy Brown was watched by 38 million people, 
and in the following season premier, Brown's life 
[was] radically changed by the two new men in her 
life: baby Brown and Vice-President Dan Quayle," 
according to CBS (Dillin, 9).
What made Quayle's speech a national issue was that 
Murphy Brown is make-believe and so is her baby. But 
in the 1990 s, those flickering images on your televi
sion screen have a powerful influence on everything. 
According to John Dillin of The Christian Science 
Monitor, conservatives say that television and the 
media are leading America to social collapse by 
legitimizing infidelity, nudity, violence, greed, and 
materialism. It seems that the focus on all the evil in 
today's society is in the entertainment industry.
So. was Quayle right? How has television reflected the 
changes in American culture, and have these changes 
been good or bad? How well does television illustrate 
changes in our moral values?
Over and over, we hear television is bad" for us, and 
hardly hear about how good television may actually 
be. It does not matter if what is seen on television is 
good or bad  television Is entertainment. However. 
Karlyn Keene, editor of American Enterprise maga
zine, said that a survey showed that 65 percent of 
Americans are concerned about the decline of values
 a level of concern that's higher than today's eco
nomic concerns (9).
Thus, it seems quite reasonable to say that television 
has a significant impact on U.S. culture, but does it 
properly reflect America's changing society? When 
television first emerged, it used the existing culture as 
a model for its audience. This uncovered inadequa
cies and contradictions in our culture, which led to our 
modification of what was to be seen on the boob tube.
Because television is primarily presentational, we 
respond to It different than how we would respond to 
writing. We respond affectively rather than cognitively; 
television promotes emotional reactions rather than 
thought reaction. Whenever we watch a drama, a 
situation comedy, a game show, or the news, our 
attention is drawn primarily to the relationships be
tween the people presented on the screen. We don't 
always remember the dialogue  we remember the 
relationships of the characters to each other and to 
ourselves.
Although some feel that television has had a negative 
impact on our society, it can be argued that it has 
actually acted as a positive initiator of change. We can 
see this through the way television helped to reshape 
the Images of women and African Americans in our 
culture.

Changing
Before the 1960's, women on 
television were not presented as 
individuals; they were only as 
mothers, wives, or sex objects. In 
the situation comedies of the 
1950's and '60s, women always 
failed to break out of their standard 
roles despite some of their venge
ful, controlling, and manipulative 
mannerisms. They were patron
ized and forced to validate them
selves to men.On dramas, women were for the most part 
excluded. As late as the early 1970's, only 28 
percent of the characters in prime-time 
programming were female (Perkinson, 17). 
Women were never seen caring for the sick, 
except as nurses, or coping with social 
problems as lawyers, detectives, teachers, or 
news reporters. Women were almost always 
housewives, girlfriends, or secretaries. Early 
game shows went further, picturing women as 
stupid and silly creatures whose only goal 
was to win that dishwasher or television set 
(17).
Women responded to these exposures with 
moral outrage, and as a result, television 
helped mobilize the women's movement 
through news interviews, talk shows, docu
mentaries, and even commercials. The 
mixture of dramas and situation comedies 
with news events about women's protests 
brought the message to people who never 
understood it before.
As the 1960's drew to a close, networks hired 
female newscasters and reporters for news 
shows and female interviewers for talk shows. 
By the mid-1970's, many shows centered 
around leading females  The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show, Maude, Police Woman, Charlie's 
Angels. No longer were women simply wives 
and mothers, and if they were, they were a 
new breed, like the attractive, divorced mother 
with a boyfriend and two teenage children on 
One Day at a Time (21). In expanded TV 
roles, women faced a host of new problems in 
creating new relationships with men. These 
dilemmas served as plots, subplots, or running 
themes for new television programs.
Since the 1960's, male-female relationships in 
our society have changed dramatically.
Dating, courting, and marriage customs are no 
longer what they were. In addition, there are 
now more working mothers than before. 
Divorces have increased in number, and 
abortion has been legalized.
On our television screens, people now saw 
women prominently displayed as 
anchorwomen on news shows (Barbara 
Walters) and as talk show hostesses (Dinah 
Shore). On dramas, there were now female 
physicians, lawyers, business executives, 
detectives, firemen, plumbers, and carpenters.
Although television has improved the female 
image, men still sometimes see women as sex 
objects. This is true in commercials such as 
those for Coors beer, in situation comedies 
such as Married... with Children, and even in 
soap operas such as As the World Turns.

---------------------------------------------------

Television started to illustrate 
changes in relationships in the late 
1960s and early '70s. Before, out-of- ,. 
the-norm relationships such as 
extramarital and homosexual rela
tionships; would never even be 
briefly mentioned at the dinner table, 
let alone on television. The emphasis 
on earlier shows, such as The 
75 Donna Reed Show and My Three 4
o Sons focused on the traditional
5 family. Of course, taboo subjects and 
controversial themes were never 
evident in the series-, because the 
censors got to it first.
s
The initial indications of cultural 
change came within TV movies and 
dramas, which began to portray the 
changes in relationships that had 
taken place in the American culture.
In 1969, during the Christmas
E

s
In The 
Black
At the midpoint of the twentieth century, African Americans in the
United States still lived in a condition of almost complete subordi- Stereotype
nation to white people. Our culture discriminated against them,
refusing to admit their dignity as human beings. Nightly television ?
shows in the 1950's put blacks in their place as maids, elevator 
operators, porters, or even fools, such as in The Three Stooges.
Also, black people on these television shows did not live in the 
same neighborhoods as the white people, nor did any of the white 
families have black friends. However, television news helped
change this. '
African American protesters may not have initially realized how 
important television was to their push for desegregation. The 
modern black revolution started in Montgomery, Alabama when 
television cameras began rolling on December 5, 1955, the first 
11 day of the black boycott of all Montgomery buses, when Dr. Martin .-
Luther King, Jr., gave a major address at the Holt Street Baptist 
Church (29).
The address was not only a plea for civil rights; it was also an 
expose of how blacks felt  tired and out of patience. Television, 
with Its bias towards encoding emotions, helped people to recast
America's racial problems as a moral problem. For the first time, n
people across the nation recognized that segregation was morally
wrong. Televised news about nonviolent marches, boycotts,
demonstrations, meetings, sit-ins, pray-ins, and freedom rides
definitely helped Intensify this feeling.
So, television not only helped to create the black revolt, but also 
helped mobilize blacks to support it by showing that protest was 
possible and that freedom was within their grasp.
In the face of these diffused yet violent and hate-filled protests, we 
became critical of the black protest movement, since the world we 
saw displayed on television dictated that blacks had attained 
tremendous cultural progress. Since then, African Americans have 
appeared regularly in many commercials, and starred in many 
positive prime-time shows such as The Jeffersons, Family Matters, 
and The Cosby Show. Racial integration was also displayed. In 
television ads, blacks worked together with whites. Also, news 
specials began to frequently report accounts of blacks in the arts, 
the academic professions, and politics.

season, NBC presented Silent Night, 
Lonely Night, an account of an 
adulterous romance between two 
married people. The next month, My 
Sweet Charlie, a positive treatment 
of a chance-encounter interracial 
romance, was aired. Traditional
S- taboos disintegrated, and weekly 
series displayed unpunished extra
marital affairs, teenage pregnancy, 
and abortion. In 1972, the TV movie, 
That Certain Summer, became the 
first movie about homosexuality

of society have changed. Many 
changes in television improved 
society. They were critical of the 
postmodern world that had risen in 
response to the criticism of the 
1960s. To these new critics, morality
rested upon tradition, which society had 
seemed to abandon. In the 1970's, they 
began to fight back. On moral grounds, 
they condemned homosexuality, abor
tion, pornography, crime in the streets, 
and lack of discipline in the schools.
In January 1971, these new critics found 
a voice on television in the form of 
Archie Bunker. On the weekly comedy 
series, All in the Family, he presented 
the traditional point of view on such 
topics as racism, homosexuality, pre
marital sex, abortion, drugs, sexual 
candor, crime, feminism, and patriotism. 
But there was a catch: Archie was a 
dumb, ignorant bigot. He used language 
like spades," chinks," pansies, dumb 
polacks, and meatheads to present a 
dual message: the show gave Archie all 
the lines, but it condemned bigotry.
While it seemed to strengthen the
attitude held by those viewers who shared 
Archie's prejudices, All in the Family actually 
helped people become critical of these 
prejudices. New social relationships were 
not going to be reversed. The new relation
ships between men and women, between 
the old and the young, between blacks and 
whites, and between an ever-increasing 
variety of ethnic groups were all morally 
better relationships than had existed before, 
and even Archie seemed to accept this 
message grudgingly.
Later, situation comedies became increas
ingly satirical, ridiculing traditionally ac
cepted relationships. Shows such as 
Batman, Hogan's Heroes, and M.A.S.H. 
made mockeries out of citizenship, authority, 
and the military, respectively. One original 
late-night show, Saturday Night Live, 
combined comedy with satire by providing a 
series of shorts impersonating popular 
television shows, influential political figures, 
and even national news with its weekly 
feature, "Weekend Update." Today, shows 
such as Picket Fences, which won the 1993 
Emmy award for best drama, have incorpo
rated various controversial issues into their 
weekly plots as well.
Moral
Changes
On
Television
By the 1960s, a mass audience could readily recognize that modern 
society did not live up to its portrayed value on television. The social 
relationships visible on TV then revealed that many people were not 
treated as Individuals but as members of groups: racial groups, sex 
groups, age groups, or ethnic groups. There were also changes In 
the prevailing social arrangements for unwed mothers, divorced 
couples, criminals, addicts, and ex-nuns. Relationships have 
changed between husbands and wives, teachers and students, 
employers and employees, and parents and children.
In the 1970's, people viewed the existing social arrangements from a 
moral point of view created by television. During the 1980's and later 
into the '90s, television responded to its moral criticism by illustrating 
mythical relationships that portrayed little or no white male domina
tion, and less female and ethnic discrimination than actually existed 
in the social arrangements of American culture. Television shows 
attempted to remove stereotypes from the screen though they still 
exist today. Serious social problems were also addressed that 
wouldn't have even been brought up in private during the '60s.
Drug abuse, the breakdown of the family, and a general populationwide abandonment of religious beliefs, have been regarded as 
results of immoral television programs. It has even been argued that 
television's sexual and violent content is eroding a sense of values 
among the viewing public. But in a study done by Baltimore City 
Public Schools, values were prominently featured in story lines and 
formed the basis for subplots, increasing the likelihood of getting , 
viewers' attention. Thus, they could serve as a source of learning 
what was right or wrong for viewers.
Television shows us the existing culture, enables us to criticize it, 
and thus facilitates our improvement. So picking up the remote 
control is not really the biggest sin of our day.

---------------------------------------------------

Some people don't believe in God. So they put their faith in technology  especially the com
puter. For several decades now the computer has been one of America's biggest fetishes. In the 1940s 
and 50s it was the physical characteristics that were so fascinating  the colorful buttons and the ticker 
tapes filled with random numbers and equations. In the 1960s the question can computers really think?" 
shaped America's newest interest  the electronic simulation of human behavior. Stanley Kubrick's 
chilling 2001: A Space Odyssey, exemplified this by giving HAL the ability to test and manipulate the 
members of the crew of Discovery just as any clever fellow human might. Now in the new era of 
computers, where microchips are coming off the assembly lines as quickly as Hostess Twinkies, we have 
become obsessed with the idea of the computer enhancing the human experience. This goes beyond the 
concept of making life more efficient (i.e. calculating mathematical problems and fixing grammatical 
errors). The computer is now used as a tool to aid us in acting out our fantasies and improving our sexual 
skills. So we find ourselves in the midst of constructing a potential cyborgean reality  merging our 
flesh with floppy drives.
It was only a matter of time before the computer was to become a vital part of the sex Industry. 
Dirty movie houses were (and still are) on the way to extinction and the video stores filled with porn films 
like The Naked Bun and A Pussy Called Wanda were becoming far too commonplace. And since pornog
raphy and erotica fans were looking for more Interactive forms of sexual pleasure other than generic smut 
photos and phone sex lines, the computer market was an enticing one to attempt to conquer.
The introduction of pornography into the computer world started slowly. First It was introduced via 
e-mail. People across the world would exchange sex stories, questions, and opinions on the Internet. Bboards covering masturbation, bestiality, pedophilia, and sadomasochism popped up almost everywhere
 including college and university campuses. People could also log in anytime and talk live with other 
interested parties, creating a computer language never seen before. This was a very optimistic beginning 
for the merging of sex with the computer. In general, the Internet enhanced communication for those who 
knew how to use it. This system still involved a relationship between people  the computer did not act 
as any sort of great barrier.
Then the demand for sexual images arose. The computer no longer was just a means of commu
nicating ideas  it became a market for visual stimulants. Soon GIFs and TIFFs arrived and despite their 
low resolution, fans were able to enjoy the naked pictures of their favorite centerfolds. The problem was 
that these pictures were basically the same as those in magazines. The only difference was that users 
now had to wait three minutes until favorite body parts appeared on the screen and then had to press a 
button to flip the pages.
QuickTime movies were the next development in sexual technology. Happy viewers could now 
watch slow motion come shots and zoom in ciit shots. And for listening pleasure groans, oohs, and aahs 
accompanied the frames to make them more realistic.
And now there is CD-ROM, which allows for the computer user to choose from many fantasies 
and communicate with their graphic babes." With a mere click on the mouse one can suck, fuck, and 
whip their digitized fantasy. And for the more discriminatory user there are packages like the Penthouse 
Interactive CD-ROM where one can choose the model and the poses. But wait, there is a special bonus... 
there are free snapshots that can be stored on disk for later viewings.
There is also the new concept of sexual virtual reality or cybersex. With virtual reality technology, 
people can enter a simulated environment where they can have a sexual encounter and experience the 
same emotional and sexual responses as they would in the real world. The worlds of the computer and 
the human are completely integrated. The probes and sensors attached to skin during the encounter are 
the links to the electronic partner.
We are actually moving further away from the human experience rather than enhancing it with 
the new pornographic and erotic interactive media. Although our responses to electronic sex may lead to 
the same results  orgasms  think about what is inspiring these physical responses. A plastic disk. 
There's no groping, grinding, or sweating involved  unless you count the movement of the hand up 
against the mouse. With these sorts of technologies we no longer will need to play little mind games to 
lure the fuck of the century into our beds. We'll have the image of a ready when you are or hard to get" 
woman or man writhing on screen. This is only the beginning of communication breakdown. Our personal 
relationships with the computers will make it more and more difficult to relate to other humans. Before we 
know it, we'll be spending our days talking to our computers and taking them out for an occasional 
cappuccino. And then perhaps scientific advancements will enable us to trade in vital body parts (starting 
with our secondary sex organs) for electronic parts we can use to make connections" with our PCs 
motherboard.
It's an escape.
In some ways its a result of repressed sexuality which leads to low self esteem. We all know that 
there are set standards for who, what, where, and how we should express the desires that dictate our 
sexual identities. If we stray from these we are considered freaks. And so we all hide. We pretend that 
soft and hard core porn is secret, that Illegitimate photos and texts can only be found beneath the surface 
of normalcy (the highest shelf of the magazine rack). Since we are not allowed to express Interest in 
certain pleasures in plain sight, we find different means of being able to gain satisfaction  through the 
private viewing pornographic materials. Some sneak into the bathrooms to peek at pictures. Some 
disappear into the darkness of a movie theater or the privacy of their bedrooms to view films. Along the 
line we lost the ability to speak openly of what are considered abnormal pleasures for fear that we would 
be chastised by society. So unsure of the way we might convey our ideas, we turn away from conven
tional means of expression.
Hence the great escape to the computer terminal. As we move towards a highly advanced age of 
Super computing, the bodily pleasures we indulge in with human beings could easily erode away with the 
introduction of CD-ROM and virtual reality. Since we are replacing partners with manufactured electronic 
characters we will learn to accommodate them  just as we would a human partner. So the human body 
itself will erode and be replaced with machine parts. Since we are to lose the need for human interaction, 
we will no longer need the human body as a connector for the sexual acts between ourselves and 
others. We'll need different parts to receive pleasure from our new partners  a couple of wires, micro
chips, and maybe a slit for a plastic disk. By Mamj 0orek

'm going to write a 
screenplay. (Everyone says 
that's where the big money is 
for writers these days.) It's 
going to be about a woman who 
hates Men. Some will call it a 
horror film. I figure I can't go 
wrong with such an original plot. 
Who ever heard 
of a movie, I mean the large 
Hollywood kind, about 
a woman who hates 
all men  not just 
a man, or some men.

She is forced into viewing the 
female and male characters as the 
man sees them. She occupies the 
male point of view temporarily, 
because it is the only view made 
available to her. Writing about a 
woman who hates men will be a 
difficult task. It will be hard to break 
every stereotype of movie- making 
that exists to make the first Holly
wood film that caters to women  
not just in subject matter  but 
specifically for the woman's gaze as
The film may be dismissed as 
being about a woman who is 
just bitter because she needs 
a good lay (man). Whatever. 
The real reason this project
will be so threatening is
because most movies cater to
the male gaze. Even the
woman watching is interpret
well. And what exactly would that be? 
Can the womans gaze even exist? Or 
is she too much the object to be looked 
at. unable to function as any other 
player?''
It is time for a film rife with man-hating. 
Enough of this woman-hating stuff. I 
can't think of a single major Hollywood 
film that does not have some element 
of misogyny. Even those films hailed 
as having strong" female characters,
(Thelma and Louise is a fine example) 
can't escape from this framework. 
Thelma and Louise leave their men, 
leave every thing behind that is 
normal, and set off to break the rules. 
But they break too many rules. What 
they have done by the end of the film 
is so unforgivable, they can never go 
back. Even they are convinced they 
have sinned." Yes, technically they 
have broken laws, but symbolically 
they have broken free of their roles as 
women. There is no room for the 
woman outside of the law, outside of 
her role. Looks like John Wayne will 
never find his love mate
Maybe this is a Ifttle esoteric, 
maybe Thelma and Louise does no 
warrant analysis. This is a major industry 
one that we all buy into. It is ridiculous that1 
at this time we are still watching movies 
made with these sentiments as their basis. 
This is the fucking 90s  Where are all the 
women?
Hollywood movies are one example where 
it is not clear whether life or art" is doing 
the imitating, and whether or not they are 
harmless. Is misogyny so pervasive in our 
society that it cannot help but be portrayed 
in a media form which influences and 
reflects this society?
Movies are not real-life situations  they 
are romanticized and glamorized versions 
of what someone perceives as real-life. The 
underlying currents of mans hatred of 
women are therefore romantic and glamor
ous (and glorified), something that we wish 
our own lives could be like. I wish I was 
perceived as property my husband owns, 
property that can be bought in exchange for 
monetary reward (Indecent Proposal). 
Misogyny should not be edited out of
The problem is not that men
are seeing too much
violence toward
women in movies
and going home
A
Misogyny in Hollywood: Art reflecting life?
The problem is that we, as a nationT 
still thinking that it's okay to think  
behave this way. Hollywood is merely 
reinforcing it.
Theoretically, watching men pound on 
men in movies shouldn't surprise us 
anymore. What kind of shock can the 
American public possibly be getting from 
watching men mutilate and kill each 
other in. the most horrible of ways? 
Boxing is a plenty popular sport, the only 
difference in its resulting violence and 
movie violence is the added delight of 
film gore, and a more interesting
justification for why these men want 
to beat the shit out of 
each other.
Graphic violence in 
movies is just that, 
and it is getting 
worse.

The slasher film is one genre that
revels in misogyny:.the woman' is not
even seen as a whole. She is
physically divided into those parts
which individually gratify, as opposed
to the whole which terrifies. Often,
there is little effort given to even
developing a plot, the action centers.

The violence in these films is often 
. linked to the act of sex in some way; 
set in the bedroom  the killer sees
the woman he wants to mutilate,
caresses her body in some simulation
of foreplay, and then rips into her
flesh with his knife. Way back when,
in Psycho, Janet Leigh stole from her
employer to run away with a married
man. She never found happiness
though. Her last thought was probably
that she forgot to condition her hair.
She was the first of many women to
get what they deserve.
I am not affected by the violence male
characters inflict on each other in
films. There is always the good guy
and the bad guy  and the bad guy
gets what he deserves. The tried (and
tried) and true" Hollywood plots we
ail know and love bring nothing new
to our understanding of the human
psyche, or our propensity towards 
enjoying violent films. What they 
consistently do is reinforce th idea, 
that women are not equal to men. 
Female characters, no matter how 
intelligent or strong they initially are, 
always somehow fall back into one of 
very few roles available to women. 
The woman who needs protection or 
the woman who gets what she 
Reserves, the woman who presents 
HppSelf as a commodity to own, as 
^something that is readily available for 
use. All these characters are pre
sented constantly. They aren't real, 
they are characters, but where does 
the idea of these characters come 
from other than from the man . 
who wants us to perceive
women this way
some notion
that she got
what she deserved,
that she provoked the
men who raped her. Its a
movie about real life, and that
makes it even more unbelievable.
Is the male so basic, so primitive
that he cant control himself? Should
women always be wary of leading men
down the path of uncontrollable carnal
lust? The female character is portrayed
as subservient to the male and his
natural" urges. We dont like it for the
same reasons we dont like to see
people kicking dogs: the dog is weaker 
and less able to defend itself against 
attack. But the dog is mans best friend.
Of course there is more to it. Of course 
women and dogs are not equivocal. 
Everyone knows that women should 
have the same rights and opportunities 
as men. But, is it life imitating art here, 
or art imitating life? I would argue that 
the Jatter is more correct. Men are 
writing and directing most Hollywood 
films, but women are there as well, 
itiaking odes to misogyny with the best 
of them. Of course they have to, its 
Hollywood after all  it's all about 
money. So what is this telling us? That 
we want to see women "get what they
deserve"? That a film is really much
better if it plays on a womans fear?
The only violent scenes that have ever 
produced any marked reaction in me 
are those which involve women who 
are constantly brutalized. Usually, even 
these scenes are barely worth remark
ing on, because generally the female 
character is decimated easily and 
quickly by the male character. Try to 
recall a movie in which a woman and a 
man physically duke it out.
These are thgscenes of violence that 
evoke the greatest response from me. I 
don't like to see women beaten, raped, 
or otherwise brutalized. Its offensive. 
Think of Jodie Foster in The Accused. 
That movie serves to reinforce the 
attitude pervasive in most movies, and 
real life.
If Hollywood is not 
reflecting life, it is at least 
reflecting some aspect of what 
we wish our lives were like. At this 
point, it is not fair or reasonable to 
argue that sometimes a character just 
happens to be a female, or that some
times a female character happens to be a 
bad guy. In an industry where the stakes 
are defined by men, women cannot be 
perceived as equal.
The industry sets the standards, and the 
public will not allow any change. This is a 
nation which did not believe Anita Hill was 
telling the truth because she seemed too calm 
during her testimony of harassment by 
Clarence Thomas. She did not act as a woman | 
should, because she did not get emotional and .m 
fall apart. Is this a nation prepared to change 
the way more than half its population is 
perceived?   -

ne cannot escape the Image of Woman in our popular culture  es
pecially Woman herself. She is a chameleon who must always reflect new standards. 
She can never pull herself away from the figurative mirror where she is constantly 
reconstructed  where she constantly imagines herself being seen.
Woman Is expected to make herself up to be what the male desires and finds 
pleasure in. Her femininity is legitimate'' only once the male has desired her. It is for this 
reason that she is self-conscious, surveying herself constantly to ensure that the male 
will find pleasure in looking at her. A woman must constantly watch herself. She is 
almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself... And so she comes to 
consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as two constituents yet always distinct 
elements of her identity as a woman. 1
The role that Woman must play denies her any right to her own subjectivity  
even when the male gaze is not present. She improves upon her qualities even when 
the male is not present at the construction site because eventually, she will encounter 
him. Woman becomes her Image.
Currents Co-Editor

---------------------------------------------------

There is a vicious cycle that exists in Woman being the Object 
of desire. She is first expected to determine what the male viewer 
wants to see (by copying those females who have already been 
named desirable), then she must fit herself into this Image mold. As 
the spectator grows tired of the approach she takes in attempting to 
live up to the Image, she must discover a way to renew" his pleasure. 
She cannot step outside this cycle to examine and define herself on 
her terms. Her subjectivity is not her own.
Is there any way Woman can gain her own subjectivity? Will 
the way she constructs herself and the way others construct her ever 
be a problem of the past?
For now it does not seem possible. Not until Woman rejects 
her position as commodity in our consumer (capitalist) economy. 
The definition of Woman as commodity is best described as usevalue for men" and exchange value for men.2 In broader terms this 
means that she is a tool used by patriarchal culture to sell both the 
Image of herself and other profitable products. Women are abused 
as objects of sex and pleasure  a fact on which advertising and 
industry profit by tendering the [naked bodies] of women alongside 3commodities for sale."
Woman is used to sell many items, in advertisements she 
leans provocatively against a car in a tight dress; slowly sips a diet 
soda through a straw; and lies invitingly across a bearskin rug. She 
also poses mopping the kitchen floor; washing the stains out of a 
young child's shirt; and preparing the Minute rice in the pressure 
cooker. It seems that Woman must always be present in order for a 
product to be properly sold  without her it does not have the same 
value.
In a sense, Woman becomes the outside packaging for the 
product she is contracted.to sell. In order for the public consumer to 
purchase the product, she must maintain the packaging as desir
able. Therefore, Woman must package herself. She does so by 
making herself up to be the Object of pleasure  the Object of 
consumption. The idea of her being the Object of desire was derived 
by man (the dominant sex of our culture and economic infrastructure). 
Inevitably, she gets caught up in this notion of packaging and 
selling" herself, basically entrapping herself in the web of her own 
nonexistent subjectivity.
Because Woman continues to exist as a commodity who 
must package herself  even when the male spectator is not present 
(i.e. in women's magazines, movies, and books) she lacks the 
legitimate means of defining her Image on her own terms. She still 
feels the need to assess how others will see her (and the product" she 
is selling), and how she can package herself as. The rights" to this 
packaging belongs to the patriarchal society which created it and 
cannot be her own.
Woman in fashion magazines: the ultimate package
Womans skilled art of packaging herself is most explicit in 
what she considers her exclusive territory, the fashion magazine. 
What would be done without Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Glamour? 
The fashion magazine is the site of fusion between sex and style. 
What results from Woman glancing at the pages is her purchasing of 
the packages to sell herself in.
One would think that the fashion magazine produced for 
women by women would solve the problem of female subjectivity and 
allow for Woman to be the sole judge once and for all of what Image 
she wants to project, but this does not occur. The magazine, filled with 
fashion photos and advertisements, promotes Woman as the com
modity that can be bought and sold accordingly. Her value is depen
dent on a scale of desirability. The magazine is a commodity in itself,
it's primary goal is to sell its contents. In order to do so, the model must 
also be well packaged.
When Woman examines the models she may find herself 
wishing to buy not only the attire they are wearing, but their body parts 
as well  their breasts, hair, legs, and lips. So she diets, aerobicizes, 
and to the extremecuts and remolds her body. Along this painful path 
she imagines her new Image being admired by all.
In late seventies, early eighties Woman glanced at pages of 
Brooke Shields and her "nothing gets between my Calvin Klein jeans, 
Christie Brinkley and her ever so puckered up Revlon lips, and Farah 
Fawcett in her breasts. The voluptuous, long legged, feather haired 
commodity was in." All women's fashion magazines had an ample 
number of advertisements with the female gazing coyly out of the page. 
Although the audience she was supposedly gazing out at was female, 
her expression reflected that of a soft pornographic still shot  open, 
available, desirable  for men.
It might be said that the packages that models sported reflected 
femininity defined in Woman's terms since it was being represented in 
her territory, but this can easily be refuted. The Image of Woman, was 
merely transferred into a different visual field, with the hegemony of the 
Image intact. The perfect breast and hip size ironically fit the standards 
created by the male. The Image was certainly most profitable. Could this 
Image of Woman have reflected what she truly felt was the ideal 
femininity?"
Even in photos where the model was reluctant or resistant in 
looking at the camera in order to exclude any sort of desiring male gaze, 
her body was still the Image of Woman man had created. She still 
allowed herself to be a commodity part, parcel, and packaged  very 
much involved in supporting the system that exploited her.4
As a result of this constant, many feminists have expressed 
distaste for the fashion and magazine industry finding them to be part of 
the patriarchal codification and commodification that enslaved women 
and put their bodies on display." Recently, they have seen the fashion 
as a site of female resistance, masquerade, and self representation. At 
the heart of this fabrication is a gender confusion and ambiguity that 
disrupts and confounds a patriarchal culture."
Curiously enough, this notion of gender confusion and ambigu
ity has become evident and fairly popular in the fashion industry over 
the past several years. Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Harper's Bazaar 
magazine are now filled with photographs of Woman in androgynous 
packages. But whether this allows Woman to change her own Image 
remains in question. The problem comes down to what dictates the 
changes in Woman's packaging: her need to vie for subjectivity or her 
knowledge and acceptance of her role as commodity.
Challenging the Image:
The (lesbian) body in fashion advertisements
The standard Image of Woman still exists in the popular 
packaging, but seems to be taking a back seatat least for now. (Cindy 
Crawford and Claudia Schiffer do a more than efficient job selling their 
bodies for the mass market. When Cindy does her Capezio advertise
ments in her Playboy Bunny pose, one wonders what is being shown off 
more, her body or the small floral print dress she wears. It is a tough call 
to make. And when Claudia poses in her Guess Jeans advertisements 
her breasts are what seem to be wearing the price tag as opposed to the 
shirt with the label Guess?.") New clothes have arrived for the hetero
sexual consumers favorite commodity  those that belong to the 
(lesbian).
The reason these packages belong to the (lesbian) as opposed 
to the lesbian is because the representations are not blatant, they 
assume, but leave unwritten, a heterosexual context for the subject," yet

---------------------------------------------------

atthesametime avoid explicit references to heterosexuality by depicting only one individual or same 
sexed individuals within the representational frame. In addition, these models bear the signifiers of 
the sexual ambiguity or androgynous style." This sort of commodity marketing is known as gay 
window advertising. 
Models like Linda Evangelista and Kristen McMenamy have deviated from the heterosexual 
ideal femininity norm to present a type of packaging that does not correlate with the Image of 
Woman. The fashion experts dress the models in the clothing of the stereotypical butch. In a Kennar 
advertisement (Fig. 1) Linda stands dressed in a black man tailored tuxedo. On her head she wears 
a stylized fez, a hat most commonly worn by Egyptian and Turkish men. She has one hand deep in 
her pocket while she holds a cigarette in the other.
Lindas pose is not that of the traditional Object of desire. Instead, she resembles the popular 
image of the gallant dapper gentleman. In addition, her pose is reminiscent of the 1950's dressed 
up butch waiting to meet her counterpartthe femme. Linda's expression is not one that invites the 
spectator expecting the Image of Woman Into her space. She looks out of the page, scrutinizing her 
viewers rather than inviting them to admire her packaging. The resistance against the Image of 
Woman is obvious.
In other advertisements and photographs Kristen McMenamys packaging takes Lindas to 
further extremes. She goes beyond the conventional gentlemans stature. In a Harper's Bazaar 
photograph (Fig. 2) she slouches down in the chair near a large table with her legs spread open. With 
one hand she holds the letter she is immersed in and with the other she hold her robe closed. Her 
position is notthat of poised, etiquette informed female. Instead, she takes on the mannerisms of the 
typical male. Since Kristen is surrounded with signs of femininity" ballet slippers, floral tapestries, 
and jeweled hats one can once again read it as having a butch/femme theme. One wonders what 
Kristen is reading: Is it a letter from her lover? Is she sitting in such a defeated position because her 
lover has left her?
In the past year, fashion magazines have included clearer (lesbian) pictures. In addition to 
the lone butch visuals, there now exist photographs and advertisements in which females are 
interacting, touching. There is a strong hint of eroticism within the narratives  femme-femme or 
butch-femme  in the photos. It's a buy one get one free" package deal.
Dolce & Gabbana, an up-and-coming fashion design firm Is one of the leading creators of 
these new (lesbian) advertisements. Its most striking visual is femme-femme structured (see title 
page). Two beautiful long haired models are In a bedroom. They are both adorned in white skirts and 
frilly bustieres. One model reclines on the bed looking away into space with no expression for the 
spectator at all. The other sits on the floor with her head in the other model's lap. Both of her arms 
are draped across the other's arm. She looks out of the page at the viewer. She invites no one into 
the scene. She is disenchanted and impatient waiting for the viewer to lose interest.
The question the viewer is left with is why do they appear so hostile, so resistant? The 
answer may lie in the sheets in back of the models. The wrinkled, tossed about sheets plus the 
models positions imply that some sort of sexual activity has occurred. In addition, there are signs 
that activity was not restricted to the bed .The scattered pillows and creased doily rugs are equally 
as suggestive.
Other Dolce & Gabbana advertisements are not as obviously constructed as the one 
mentioned above, but still effectively package the models in a (lesbian) femme-femme manner. In 
these pictures (Fig. 3) three models are in a dimly lit room. Two sit on the couch. One leans back 
casually. The other sits straight up with her legs apart. Their expressions are antagonistic and 
exclusionary. They too seem to be waiting for the viewer to lose interest and look away. The third 
figure in the scene is the most sexual. She leans up against pillows on the floor in front of the couch. 
Her amused facial expression suggests that the group is about to do something. That something 
is elusive, but the screen with clothing draped over it in the background hints that there may be some 
undressing in the near future once the gaze is removed.
The Ferretti Jeansphllosophy advertisement (Fig. 4) portray a packaged butch-femme 
relationship. It is most interesting the way it establishes power relations between the two models. The

---------------------------------------------------

butch (lesbian), dressed in all black has her arm draped possessively round her partner's waist. She seems to be looking 
out at her spectator, but upon closer examination, one will find that her eyes are focused off to the side. Her expression reads' 
that of an individual who has power and has marked her territory  My woman (to put it in Tarzan terms)." The fei 
dressed in white pants and a black tank top is the passive figure. She, gazes out at her audience, in mock surprise at being, 
caught in this position and at her partners dominating actions.
How and why the (lesbian) has become a major package option in order for Woman to sell herself is a mystery. Is 
she finally visible because she has gained ground as a consumer? Is she being used as atool for Woman to gain subjectivity? 
Or is she just simply the wrappings for a sellable commodity?
Appropriation of subcultural/alternative acts has always piSyed an important role in bringing certain commodity 
aesthetics into our mainstream heterosexual society. In this context, commodity aesthetic refers to the dressing up" and 
beautifying of a certain commodity to add to its selling points What causes consumers to purchase any given product is not 
its real use value, but the aesthetics of the commodity as it impinges on the sensuality of the purchaser. Desire, hopes, and 
longings are projected onto the surface of the commodity.7"
It is questionable how fair the appropriation and assimilation process is. Especially when one is talking about the 
social representations and rituals of a group which are not considered part of the mainstream. It is positive in the sense that 
the alternative group is gaining recognition for something it has created, but is disparaging in the way ideas and 
representations are reshaped to suit the consuming public. For example, theorists like Monique Wittig have voiced their 
discomfort with the way in which appropriation is not an equal exchange process. Discourses of heterosexuality oppress us 
in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms  they deny us the possibility of creating our 
own categories. "
The way in which the (lesbian) body is transferred from its subcultural contexts into the heterosexual magazine market 
is problematic. In order for the lesbian to be used as packaging forthe Image of Woman  she must be placed in the category 
of Woman. For some lesbians this does not cause conflict, butfor others it may bean ethical problem, since they have resisted 
being placed into the restrictive framework of Woman in order to establish their own identity. "Lesbians have had a long 
tradition of resisting dominant cultural definitions of female beauty and fashion as a way of separating themselves from 
heterosexual culture politically and as a way of signaling their lesbianism to other women in their subcultural group?"
Once the lesbian is placed into the category of Woman, she immediately becomes a commodity and is immediately 
accepted in the fashion world for this matter. Her assets are now used to dress up the Image of Woman In order to sell 
conventional products. As. a.result, her life-style goes mainstream." Hence the popularization of such terms as lipstick 
lesbians" and the granola girls in magazines.

---------------------------------------------------

(Lesbian) Images = Female Subjectivity?
Using (lesbian) imagery within the fashion industry marks a new 
direction for representations of Woman on the marketplace. Ironically enough, 
there have been no great protests from males concerning the femininity" of 
some of the models in the (lesbian) fashion photographs. Could this be a sign 
of surrender? is Woman's counterpart finally allowing us to define herself on her 
own terms? Can she finally pack away her mirror and insecurities?
This is highly unlikely, especially since the male still holds much power 
over economic consumption. Woman's supposed rebellion against ideal stan
dards of femininity have not gone unnoticed. In fact it has drawn much attention 
from those who wish to capitalize from it. The political and social importance of 
fashion resistant bodies (those who do not want to be the Image of Woman) is 
transformed into a necessary economic tool. Style as resistance becomes 
commodifiable as chic when it leaves the political realm and enters the fashion 
world Why not capitalize on Woman's discontent? Why not allow and 
encourage her to change her packaging to reflect that of the most dominant 
resistant body  the lesbian?
Woman has not gained subjectivity as a result of her newfound 
(lesbian)ism. She has simply shown that she is capable of packaging herself in 
an alternative manner which more often than not might not be appealing to the 
male spectator. She has simply appropriated the style of another category  
the lesbian  and attempted to use her a shield against her popular Image. But 
her role in the marketplace is not so easily forgotten. The market allows for the 
resistance against the popular Image turning it into the latestfashion. Therefore, 
Woman as commodity once again gets caught up in the packaging process. Its 
an interesting exchange  monetary compensation for female resistance.
Because the (lesbian) packaging is regarded as a commodity aes
thetic, it has a short life span on the consumer market. Once Woman finds 
another means of trying to gain subjectivity a new package must be appropri
ated in order to make profit. Commodities enter the world with a kind of timing 
device which will trigger off their inner self-destruction within a calculated 
period. By periodically redesigning a commodity [aesthetics] appearance, it 
reduces the use-valuetime of the specific commodity [aesthetic], whose models 
are already functioning in the sphere of consumption!1"
Once the (lesbian) imagerys life span is over, the stratified layers of 
packaging are stripped off of Woman leaving her susceptible to manipulation 
once more. The more Woman tries define herself, the more her new self" is 
exploited for profit.

Outreach program 
trains immigrants
By KATHY WRIGHT
Tartan Staffwriter
A new program on campus, established by the Modem Languages 
Department, reaches out to Russian immigrants new to the Pitts
burgh area. The program is an extension of an already existing 
program at the Career Development Center (CDC) of the Jewish 
Family Service in Squirrel Hill.
These Russian immigrants are already highly educated and knowl
edgeable of English, but they do not yet have jobs here. They study 
English as a Second Language (ESL) at the CDC to improve their 
speaking and listening skills. Some of the students find jobs in the 
U.S. immediately or after a few months. Others who are advanced in 
their knowledge of the English language now have the opportunity 
to come to the Outreach program on campus to improve their English 
usage.
In the Outreach program, students take an ESL class to improve 
their English by practicing realistic situations that they will encoun
ter once they reach the job market. A lot of time is spent speaking to 
prepare for job interviews and on-the-job specifics, such as explain
ing how equipment works or how to perform a specific task.
The students also have the opportunity to audit one course on 
campus. Most of the nine participants audited a computer science 
class for the hands-on practicality. Not only are they learning about 
the importance of-computers and how to use them but also taking a 
class which improves their listening and comprehension skills.
In addition to the ESL class and the course they choose to audit, 
the Russian students are tutored individually by an undergraduate 
student for two hours each week. This type of one-on-one attention 
gives the Russians an opportunity to practice the art of conversation, 
American style, and get clarification about any misunderstandings 
they have encountered in their classes.
Barbara Freed, head of the Modem Languages Department, 
explains the uniqueness of this Outreach program for ESL instruc
tion. Content based language instruction integrates language in
struction for [English] into a specific course discipline. This ap
proach is appealing because the program becomes catered to the 
individual needs and desires of the students. It is also a practical 
approach since the next step for the Russian students is to head into 
the job market.
The Russians are not the only ones benefiting from this program, 
either. The undergraduate tutors have learned a lot about teaching 
and the process of language acquisition. There is also some degree of 
personal involvement by both the students and the tutors. Most of 
the tutors are of Russian descent, so outside of class they may learn 
more about Russia from the students and practice their Russian 
language skills. The Russian students have more opportunities to 
increase their English fluency in these encounters as well.
Both Sue Todhunter, the ESL class instructor, and Freed agree 
that this, the first semester of the Outreach program, has been 
successful. Its been going great. They have made so much progress, 
says Todhunter about the improvement of her Russian students.
Freed also says, Its a really exciting thing. The Russians are 
excited, and I think the undergraduates are excited, too. Hopefully 
this excitement will continue to generate interest and funds so that 
the Outreach program can continue next year.
Community Literacy Center has students tutoring

The Community Literacy Cen
ter (CLC) is a collaboration of 
Pittsburghs Community House 
on the Northside and the Center 
for the Study of Writing and Lit
eracy at Carnegie Mellon. The 
center was founded two years ago 
and has gained support from the 
Howard Heinz Foundation, Pitts
burgh Public Schools, Commu
nity College of Allegheny County, 
ancl many others. It is fighting 
illiteracy by using writing and 
communication to take action, to 
address the dreams and urban 
problems, as stated in the 
programs goals. The three ma
jor initiatives of CLC are IN
FORM, HELP, ARGUE, in which 
college students work with urban 
teens to improve reading, writ
ing, and communication skills. 
The center has also played a key 
role in giving teens an active voice 
in the community and in bridg
ing the understanding gap be
tween teens and adults. The 
project is presently in great de
mand not only to improve the 
conventional areas of spelling, 
style, and grammar, but to help 
teens take part in literate actions 
and practices. Recently, the CLC 
received a two-year grant from
the Bingham Trust Foundation, 
totaling $200,000, to continue 
their fight against illiteracy.
The INFORM branch helps 
teens address their concerns 
about the areas they live in 
through the Going to Work 
projects. With the aid of their 
Writing Mentors, kids con

lawyers, plumbers, doctors, and

teens vital tools such as planning

vising plans, and producing 
guidelines and policies that would

fictional dialogues to respond in 
their own best interest, when 
faced with decisions such as sub

The Student Mentors, those 
who work directly with the teens,

Horror Stories
By Tom Harper
Well, lots of things have been getting 
my attention around campus lately. So, 
when I sat down to type this article, I 
thought, Maybe Ill make this column 
about a few little things instead of one 
big thing. Its new, exciting, spontane
ous, and a few other adjectives with good 
connotations. So why not?
Our first snow was last weekend. Im 
one of those people who really likes 
snow. The first snow is, well, kind of 
special. So I just went tramping around 
campus checking out how it looked in 
the snow. The biggest thing that held 
my gaze was the mud hole in between 
Skibo and the tennis courts.
Snow brings back lots of memories. 
Like the time I went sledding down my 
hill and went too far and onto the road 
and a semi almost hit me. Ah, yes, the 
memories. Alscj tne time the big kids 
kicked snow in my face because I almost 
broke my arm', wiping out. Those were 
the days, right?
I noticed lots of people have been wear
ing hats similar to mine. Did I start a 
trend? Maybe, maybe not. For those who 
insist on not capitalizing on the joys of a 
nice-looking hat, let me convince you

Tattoos,body piercings, capture personal art form
Some get tattoos to celebrate impor
tant events in their lives, making 
their skin into a living diary. Others 
get tattoos because of the personal 
meaning of the picture they have had 
impressed into their skin.
cover-up tattoo still leaves the person with a tattoo, usually darker 
and often somewhat larger.
For most serious fans, tattoos have an immensely personal mean
ing. Some get tattoos to celebrate important events in their lives, 
making their skin into a living diary. Others get tattoos because of I 
the personal meaning of the picture they have had impressed into 
tKeir skin. Often there is a mixture between these two reasons. Once 
marked, the desire for more often becomes evident.
The experience itself varies from person to person. This reporter 
tound the sensation of the guns needle to be merely unpleasant for 
most of the time. Occasionally it actually hurts, mainly when the 
arfcst redrew lines that had already been done before. There are 
several factors involved in how much it hurts such as the persons 
tolerance, the location, whether outlining or shading is being 
one, and the skill of the artist.
Care must be taken to prevent scabbing and infection, which often 
lead to scarring. If a scar develops, color can be lost and parts of the 
tattoo must be redone. Since scar tissue is much tougher than skin, 
redrawing over a scar is often highly painful, so scarring is to be 
avoided at all costs. Most artists recommend frequent washing's and 
treatment with antibiotic and moisturizing lotions to prevent this.
Piercing, too, is often used to symbolize a rite of passage. Places 
tnat have been pierced are ears, eyebrows, lips, tongue, nose, 
nipples, navels, and genitals, and there may be others. Done without 
anesthetic, some pierces can be very painful and it is important to 
select a professional to perform the piercing. Depending on the 
pierce, permanent nerve and functionality damage can occur if done 
improperly.
Tattoo conventions are held throughout the world. If nothing else, 
the Meeting of the Marked will be back next Halloween .
Program exposes urban life
ijCLC, from page LI
At the CLC, you get to know the 
people involved, whats actually 
going on in their lives, and what 
they think about it and you come 
away thinking not only that some
thing needs to be done to make it 
better, but that you personally 
can do something to make it bet
ter.
Davis feels that it would be 
unrealistic to expect to change all 
! the negatives of the world as a 
CLC intern, but that any effort is 
notin vain. He says the project is 
there to give voice to community 
members, and even if that voice 
is leaching just one person. The 
i,program has been a success.
Rhodi Chambliss, senior social 
and decision sciences major and 
student mentor, has worked with 
students who have witnessed killmgs, experienced violent acts of 
Prejudice against them, and live 
ln fear of having run-ins with 
Sang members. Chambliss piles 111 a bus with the other mentors
every Monday and Wednesday. 
One of these groups is dealing 
with the subject of violence while 
the other group concentrates on 
risky situations and how to re
spond to them.
Chambliss speaks of personal 
exposure to violence, Living on 
campus here makes you feel so 
safe and secure. With so many 
assignments and deadlines, there 
isnt a lot of time to watch the 
news. Therefore, it became easy 
for me to get out of touch. I grew 
up in a violent neighborhood with 
no money and I witnessed every
day how innocent lives can be 
snatched up in the time it takes a 
car to turn a corner. But being 
here for three years makes those 
memories blur. I can think, 
People can choose how they want 
to live their lives. If you study, 
and be good, you can escape that 
[violence, crime]. Chambliss 
would like every city to have a 
place in which teenagers could 
actively voice their opinion in orand meets two groups of kids der to begin finding a solution to 
working and writing at the Com- problems that plague teens and 
nmnity House on the Northside, urban areas nationwide.

I This Halloween weekend, the Sheraton at Station Square was 
liome to the annual Meeting of the Marked. This is a tattoo and 
piercing convention, where fans of body art met, talked, and got 
sfgfced and tattooed. People wore clothes with holes, and some men 
#etit shirtless to display their markings. Everywhere the buzzing of 
tattoo guns filled the air, and people waited patiently for their turn 
jjiiler the gun. Everyone was very friendly, gladly talking about the 
art on their skins, or their pierces.
, Tattooing is an ancient art. The ice man, a frozen corpse found in 
be Alps, had several tattoos. Many tribes have used tattooing as 
markings of status and as means of beautifying their body. Piercing 
jtiil ritual scarification have also been used for this purpose. In 
jjnventional society the only common piercing used is for earrings, 
jut many other places are possible.
c Tattooing has evolved from dark shops to well lit, sterile facilities, 
ft professional artist will use new needles each time and autoclaves, 
nondisposable equipment after every use. Rubber gloves are worn, 
and the danger from AIDS or hepatitis is non-existent from a 
professional, modem artist.
Although mainstream society still views tattoos as a stigma, some 
trendsetters are getting inked, as the slang goes. This is the worst 
RSsible reason to get a tattoo. While removal techniques exist, they 
ir6 generally very expensive andnotcompletely reliable. Often some 
marking will remain. Those who rush out to get tattooed because 
everyone is may find that their haste has marked them forever with 
something they would rather not have. The alternative of getting a

DIVERSIONS
Burtons Nightmare exhibits ghoulish ambition
j3y DAVID BAZELON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Hey, I know what you are all 
thinking- Another holiday sea
son is quickly approaching and, 
along with it, a mass-media ex
plosion of holiday related hype. It 
takes hold of our radios, possesses 
our television sets, and, from time 
to time, creeps up to the big 
screen. All the while, it manages 
to suck out those last remaining 
active brain cells right through 
our skulls. Skipllipppt! There is 
certainly no individual who is 
immune to this; heck, who 
hasnt seen the Grinch prac
tice his evil exploits in 
Whoville every winter since 
they were five?
This year, however, 
theres something a 
little different in
festing our 
local 
movie the
ater s .
Who bet
ter to 
bring 
us some
thing a little 
different than 
filmmaker Tim 
Burton?
After numerous successes in 
the fantasy film genre, including 
such works as Beetlejuice and the 
.incredibly successful Batman, 
Burton is trying his hand at a full 
length stop-motion animation 
musical entitled, in truly macamore impressive by an abundance 
of camera movement, which is 
incredibly difficult to shoot frame 
by frame. As the figures dance 
and sing, the camera spins above 
them, around them, and, since a 
good number of them are ghosts, 
through them.
Burton often displays a unique 
flair in this medium both in his 
most recent films and in his ear
lier work with Disney. He used to 
be an animator for Disney and, in 
fact, originally conceived the idea 
for Nightmare as a three-page 
poem he wrote while working as
bre Burton form, The Nightmare 
Before Christmas.
Nightmare is a marvelous spec
tacle to view. The animation, 
having taken two years to com
plete, is unbelievably smooth and 
lifelike. All of the monsters and 
mayhem that ensue be
come comical visions 
as they are rein
terpreted through 
imagery that re
sembles a world full of 
playthings rather than 
a picture of reality. Its 
like a myriad of toys that 
go bump in the 
night.
It is not sur
prising that 
Nightmare, be
ing made right on 
the heels of Ju
rassic Park, with 
its computer-generated dinosaurs, 
seems to be con
tinuing the 
search for new 
ways to generate 
depictions of the 
impossible. A fulllength stop-motion animation 
film has never 
been achieved before 
this film, and the flu
idity of Nightmares 
motion has rarely 
been exhibited in the 
area of stop-motion 
animation. Each se
quence is made all the Jack Skellington tries to find the formula for Christmas spirit.
a Disney animator, which he later 
turned into script form. After 
numerous rejections of the con
cept, Burton abandoned the con
cept to continue with his other 
projects. Burton said, It was go
ing to be a 20-minute short film; 
I had just done a short called 
Vincent, and wanted to do some
thing else that could be narrated 
by Vincent Price. I had this poem 
that I wanted to do as a Hallow
een special or something, so I 
took it to the networks and all 
over the place trying to get it 
produced. But it was probably a
good thing it wasnt made at the 
time. Now that Burton has 
found success and has become 
acquainted with such profession
als as Danny Elfinan, he has 
returned to work with Disney 
to finally release Nightmare.
Not only does Nightmare 
give Burton a chance to 
practice his favorite 
craft with Disney giv
ing him complete freedom, 
but it also offers Elfman a chance 
to compose his most involved 
soundtrack yet. Elfman fans will 
be thrilled to learn that he not 
only writes the 
music but also 
takes over the 
singing voice of 
Jack Skel
lington, the 
main character. 
It is incredible 
how much Elf
mansoundslike 
Jacks spoken 
voice (Chris 
Sarandon of 
Fright Night 
fame). For most, 
it would not be 
apparent that 
there were two 
separate voices 
for Jack until 
the rolling of the 
credits.
Another voice 
to listen for is 
Catherine 
OHara from
plays Jacks love interest, Sally. 
Also, if you listen closely, you 
might be able to notice that 
one of the 
trick-oraef'0o fo
1993 Touchstone Pictures
 1993 Touchstone Pictures.Beetlejuice who
ken by Paul 
Reubens.
Those who have come to love 
Burtons dark style will not be 
disappointed. The movie at
tempts to integrate different per
ceptions of holiday s with Burtons 
habit for making the most un
usual and twisted character in 
the story have the most profound 
and honest position in society. 
Rather than being simply a 
Christmas movie, this film fo
cuses on Halloween.
It takes place in Hal
lo weentown and focuses on Jack 
Skellingtons discovery of other, 
brighter places. Making sure to 
engage both optimists and pessi
mists, the film skyrockets into a 
maniacal conflict where 
everyones warped view of life is 
always misunderstood. Night
mare forces viewers to judge the 
characters by more than conven
tional qualities like physical 
beauty.
Dont get the wrong impression 
of this film. Its just scary enough 
that it can be loved by both kids 
and adults for its ghoulishness.
Oleanna plays at City Theatre
By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Staffwriter
The City Theatre put on another strong 
and fascinating production. In this case 
it was David Mamets Oleanna, an in
tense drama dealing with a jaded college 
professor, John, and a junior named 
Carol who comes to him for help.
The stage was impeccable: a hard
wood office filled with the normal clutter 
of a more organized professor. There 
were no family photos on the desk or any 
posters of Garfield imbibing coffee and 
mourning Mondays, but maybe they 
were not necessary.
John, a tired, almost bitter man, is 
played with a gentle hand by Kenneth 
Meseroll. Carol, a young woman who 
evidently has suffered some hardships 
in her past, is portrayed by Victoria 
Rhodes. v
The plot revolves around the interac
tion between John, a wielder of power, 
and Carol, who feels his power unearned 
and unnecessary. In the beginning, Carol 
comes to him confused about his ideas of 
the ritualistic hazing that he believes 
is inherent in higher education. John is 
the stereotypical professor, angry at the 
futility of what he is teaching and hardpressed to understand the problems of 
his students. Carol is the stereotypical 
student, frustrated at her failing grades 
and confused at her role in the univer
sity. However, very slowly, these masks 
of teacher and student fade and the 
truly human aspects of their characters 
emerge.
After John touches Carols shoulders 
in trying to console her, the ball starts 
rolling. The audience is forced to side 
with one character or the other as the 
play progresses and as Carol becomes 
strong and angry, accusing John of rape 
after he tries to force her to stay in his 
office and talk about what both of them 
are trying to achieve. The intensity 
reaches a manic pace when John attacks
her in the end. And the audience is left 
wondering who, if anyone, was in the 
right. *
Mamets work does not attack femi
nism or political correctness, but the two 
ideologies seem to cling to the actual 
message of power play like burrs. You 
know youve reached someone when a 
group of women start clapping when 
John slaps Carol and slams her onto his 
desk.
Victoria Rhodes was the perfect col
lege student. She was confused and 
addled by the problems of university life 
while still trying desperately to use them 
to her advantage. Kenneth Meseroll was 
an exhausted teacher, tired of what he 
was saying to the extent that it was a 
routine to him. However, Mamets writ
ing was about as fluid as library paste. 
The dialogue is quick and powerful but 
devoid of contractions and filled with 
painfully outdated language. It was 
strange listening to seemingly modem 
characters speak like bad English books. 
If there was anything wrong with this 
play, it would be Mamets language.
Oleanna is a play that deals with sex
ism and power. The energy starts low 
and reaches an incredible intensity at 
the rather abrupt ending. The staging 
was done well, though not extremely so, 
but the play was thought-provoking and

110The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  8 November 1993
New film obscures suspense with clichs
By SUSAN STUART
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Bring together an introverted, 
tough-skinned Texan plagued by 
a terrifyingly violent past, and a 
sweet but mixed-up young tempt
ress; add a little fateful irony and 
set it all against a background of 
stiark, desolate WestTexan plains
 what do you get? Suspense? 
Drama? Romance? Flesh and 
Bone delivers all these qualities. 
Ai times, the movie does so quite 
effectively, but the aura of mys
tery is bogged down with a bundle 
of clichs that undermine the po
tential of the plot and characters.
Dennis Quaid stars as Arlis 
Sweeney who, as a boy, was used 
by his father as an accomplice to 
tliievery and eventually murder. 
As a man, Arlis is hardened and 
withdrawn, preferring machines 
to people but compassionate and 
vulnerable underneath his shell. 
Pie succeeds in keeping his past 
buried deep inside until he meets 
Kay Davies, played by Meg Ryan. 
Arlis falls for Kay, who is persis
tent, but tender, in her seduction 
of him. Just as Arlis opens him
self up to his newfound emotions, 
he discovers a horrifying coinci
dence that links his past to Kays. 
Arlis then shuts himself off from 
ay until his fear for her life 
forces him to face both their pasts.
The portrayal of the hideous 
childhood incident that haunted 
Arlis throughout his life was suc
cessfully suspenseful. The over
whelmingly long stretch of silence and tough, and James Caan as he

in this type of film) at the start of exaggerate personality traits, you

eternity, as a baby

tion, a halting of 
time, allows the 
psychological 
magnitude of the 
event to pervade 
the viewers mind 
before moving on.
But for all its 
suspense andcompelling story line, 
director Steve 
Kloves intended 
this movie to cen

jor characters are 
overblown: Quaid

 1993 Paramount Pictures 
One of the few saving graces of Flesh and Bone is the 
chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan.
most successful. While it was 
slightly exaggerated, he main
tained complexity in his charac
ter.
He was simultaneously the an
noying parent, slimy pervert, and 
cold-blooded murderer. At times, 
we saw a little too much of Ryans 
silly cuteness, which was right 
on target in When Harry Met 
Sally, but quite off-key 
for this film.
I was also bothered by 
some of the humor in this 
movie. While humor can 
be used effectively as 
comic relief in a serious 
plot, the jokes were occa
sionally too lighthearted 
and too funny. However, 
these lighter moments 
did help to build chemis
try between Quaid and 
Ryan which was pretty 
powerful  a real plus 
for this film.
If youre into suspense 
films, you will probably 
want to see this movie. 
The plot is very intrigu
ing, real edge-of-the-seat 
kind of stuff.
On the other hand, if 
you enjoy getting inside 
a character, you might 
look elsewhere for enter
tainment.
Ironically enough, the 
characters in this movie 
seemed to be made of 
cardboard, not flesh and 
bone.

Lois and Clark TV series stays true to Supermans original storyline
In my first column, I said I was going 
to do more than just review comics. I 
said that I would talk about comics in 
other forms of the media and about the 
comic industry as a whole. So far, Ive 
only talked about the problem of gim! mick covers as far as the industry is 
concerned, and Ive ignored the media 
altogether. Now, in this column, I am 
going to keep my promise and discuss 
these issues.
In the fall of season premieres, ABC 
launched a new series, Lois and Clark: 
The New Adventures of Superman. For
tunately, I only live 20 minutes away 
from campus and I have kind and intel
ligent parents who are not only willing 
to, but actually know how to program a 
VCR for their son who is slaving away at 
school. However, I ran into a big prob
lem. The two hour pilot episode was over 
before I realized what time it was sup
pose to premier. But, thanks to modem 
technology and one post to the bboard 
netnews.alt.comics.superman, I had the 
two hour first episode in my hands in 
about a month. Ahh, the information 
age.
Finally, after a few weeks of having 
the first episode, I went home for a 
weekend and caught up on my TV view
ing. Initially, I was quite skeptical about 
this new show. I liked how the title Lois
Comic Book Chronicles
_______________ By Jason Andracki
and Clark is a takeoff of Lewis and 
Clark, the famous explorers, but it scared 
me because the title seemed to empha
size that there would be more of a focus 
on Clark Kent rather than Superman. I 
also heard that ABC was trying to at
tract female viewers to the show in a 
way similar to the way DC is trying to 
attract more female readers by giving 
Superman Fabio-like looks. In doing so, 
the show would concentrate more on the 
worlds strangest love triangle involving 
Superman, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent. I 
wasnt sure how to react to this, so I 
proceeded to watch the first episode not 
expecting much out of it.
Wow, was I ever surprised! The first 
episode proved to be an excellent intro
duction to the Superman legend. It is 
actually worthy enough to be compared 
to the mid-80s John Bryne revamping in 
the six issue The Man Of Steel. Yes, I 
think its that good.
The major reason I like it so much is 
that it is faithful to the Superman leg
end that I love. What turns me off to 
comic book-based TV shows and movies 
is that producers and directors alter the 
origins of the character to make them fit 
better into their medium. There is next 
to none of this in Lois and Clark. Sure, 
there are a few minor changes such as 
Perry White being a southerner, and 
instead of exclaiming, Great Caesars 
ghost! he opts for Great shades of Elvis! 
One significant change that is definitely 
a plus is how Superman is unsure of his 
Kryptonian heritage. He nearly had his 
hands on the space ship that brought 
him to earth in the second episode, but 
then it was moved to a new location. 
This ensures further developments as 
the series progresses.
There are many subtleties in this se
ries that make it great. While in the 
Daily Planet offices, Clark hears about a 
bank robbery at the comer of Carlin and 
Ordway. Carlin is the editor-in-chief of 
DC and Ordway is one of the most fa
mous Superman artists. Also, there was 
a scene with Lex Luthor (who is not bald, 
I might add) asking if Superman can, 
Leap tall buildings in a single bound, 
and all the other feats from the opening 
credits of the original Superman TV 
series. Perhaps my favorite moment was 
when a reporter at the Daily Planet 
gasps, Would you believe? as Super
man flies through an open window car
rying Lois Lane. Perry White answers, 
What, that a man can fly. This quote 
was taken from the promo poster of the 
first Superman movie, bragging about 
the special effects, You Will Believe 
That a Man Can Fly.
Although 
they dont brag 
about them, the 
special effects of 
this show are 
surprisingly 
good for a TV 
show. I was im
pressed. How
ever, the char
acterizations in 
this show are 
what I really 
enjoy. For ex
ample, Super
man is quite a 
mamas boy. He 
flies from Me
tropolis to 
Small ville every 
night for dinner 
and he often 
calls home, usu
ally in just a 
towel. (I told you 
they were trying
to get female viewers.) What I like most, 
because I can identify with it (although 
my clothes never had a bomb stain), is 
that Superman calls his mother to ask 
her questions about doing laundry. Lois 
Lanes character is also the same as it is 
in the comics. She continues to be a cold, 
relentless reporter who has 
a soft side that few people 
see. Even the supporting 
characters* like Jimmy 
Olsen and Cat Grant, are 
developing personalities 
that match the comic 
books. From what little I 
have heard about this 
show, it is getting fairly 
good reviews. Im happy, 
because I hope it will be 
around for a while. One 
minor complaint, however, 
is that I hope to see some 
supervillians from the 
comics show up sometime, 
like Bizarro, Brainiac, and 
maybe even Doomsday. 
How about a Death of Su
perman cliffhanger for a 
season ending?
