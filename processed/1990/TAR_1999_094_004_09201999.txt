Last week, 1,000 undergraduates 
signed a petition asking Student Senate 
to reconsider two motions passed during 
the second week of the semester. The 
legislation under question permitted 
using part of the Student Activities Fee 
to purchase parking permits for the Stu
dent Body President (SBP), Student 
Body Treasurer (SBT), and Senate Chair.
I talked to a lot of people about it, and 
everyone thought it was a bad idea. I 
was aware of the student body directive 
rules because I was on Senate, said 
Mike Strauss, a fifth-year computer sci
ence major who started the petition. I 
knew people wanted to react but didnt 
know how to, he said.
According to Senate bylaws, the un
dergraduate student body can force Sen
ate to reconsider a motion if at least five 
percent of Activities Fee-paying under
graduates sign a petition.
The petition, which circulated around 
campus for two days, was presented at 
Thursdays Senate meeting. Although 
they could technically spend a week vali
dating signatures, Senators voted to re
consider the two motions involved imme
diately. After much debate, they voted to 
refer the matter to the Campus Affairs 
Committee to assess how students felt. 
This means that at this point, it is as if the 
motions were never passed. The motions 
will, however, be brought up again.
Senate Chair Pat Ditterline, a senior 
electrical and computer engineering 
(ECE) major, also read a letter from 
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student Af
fairs. In the letter, Murphy offered to 
pay for the three permits out of his 
budget for this year to satisfy some of the
concerns expressed by students.
I wanted Senate, in particular, to be 
able to focus on other issues in the near 
term, and then consider this issue over a 
broader period of time without a need for 
an immediate decision, said Murphy.
Referring the issue to Committee is 
the best thing that could have been done. 
Now the Campus Affairs Committee can 
research the situation fully, said 
Ditterline. The petition shows that 
members of the campus community care 
about this, and now the Committee can 
use surveys and other information-gath
ering methods to see what the issues 
are, exactly, and to what extent each 
issue is part of the problem, he said.
While Strauss argued that 1,000 sig
natures should send a strong message to 
Senate about how students feel, several 
Senators expressed the feeling that the 
petition did not provide sufficient infor

front of Doherty Hall last week.
mation to make a decision about the 
students feelings.
We made the mistake of making this 
decision without enough information the 
first time. It would be a bigger mistake 
to do it again, said H&SS representa
tive Beth Ferrick, a senior psychology 
major, to her fellow Senators.
Not all Senators agreed, though. Sena
tor Ashley Gross, a sophomore ECE ma
jor, said that she doubted the Campus 
Affairs Committee could reach as many 
students as Strauss did. With over 20 
percent of the campus signing the peti
tion, a higher percentage of students 
expressed their dissatisfaction with 
these motions than voted in the last 
student government election.
This discontent with the majority opin
ion was expressed by a number of visi
tors to the meeting.

For the last year, construc
tion on campus has been exten
sive, and while all eyes have 
been on the new Purnell Center 
for the Arts, two other groups 
have been hard at work plan
ning and constructing additions 
to the campus.
Newell-Simon Hall is an amal
gamation of what is currently 
known as BOM-C and BOM-D. 
BOM stands for Bureau of Mines. 
The six buildings in that complex
occupy the newly created space. 
The building will be ready for 
occupants starting October 1, and 
while construction will continue 
through until December, most 
groups should be moved into the 
new area by October 20, accord
ing to James Secosky, senior 
project manager for Facilities 
Management Services. The Ro
botics Institute (RI), the HumanComputer Interaction Institute 
(HCII), and the Language Tech
nologies Institute (LTI), as well 
as the School of Computer Sci
ence (SCS) Deans Office are

once comprised the headquarters 
for the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and 
are commonly referred to as Build
ing C and Building D. The project 
includes not only renovations, but 
also an additional floor to BOM-D 
and a bridge from the fourth floor 
of Wean Hall to the new hall.
As construction on the new floor 
of BOM-D comes to completion, 
preparations are being made to
slated to move into the new space.
While the expansion may seem 
large, the space offered by NewellSimon is dearly needed, and will 
be filled quickly.
[There will be] some room for 
growth in RI and LTI, but HCIFs 
space will be fully occupied at the 
start, said Jim Skees, building 
facilities manager. The School 
of Computer Science had to agree
Ueuamv 9t9omn CIm9 v.amym99
to relinquish its- current spaces 
in Cyert Hall and Doherty Hall. 
So the fact that HCII and LTI are 
moving a bunch of offices and 
labs out of Wean will be a nearly 
zero-sum game for the [Computer 
Science Department] unit.
In addition to offices and labs, 
there will be a 74-seat, sloped 
floor lecture hall, a much bigger 
Robotics Education Lab for use 
in graduate and undergraduate 
courses, a big atrium with food 
and coffee vendors, and new ma
chine and wood shops for Robot
ics, said Skees.
Once the new floor is complete, 
the second phase of construction 
will begin. This phase, which is 
planned to start in January 2000 
and be completed in September 
of that same year, involves a com
plete renovation of the existing 
space in BOM-D. Only the car 
barn will be left entirely un
touched, said Secosky. The new 
space will contain much-needed 
office and lab space for the SCS.
The new wing that is planned 
for Baker Hall begun construc
tion along Frew Street this June 
and is on schedule for completion 
some time in August of2000, hope
fully in time for classes next fall.
The construction of the addi
tion will necessitate the removal 
of the Center for Applied Ethics, 
a conference room currently used 
by the History Department, and 
a third-floor classroom in Baker, 
in order to make the connection 
to the new wing possible, accord
ing to Associate Dean of H&SS, 
Joel Greenhouse. Because of this, 
several moves have to be made.

Starting on October 1, Carnegie 
Mellon students will be the first to 
be able to connect to the 
Internet via a wireless 
network service while 
eating lunch on the Cut 
or even while sitting in a 
public toilet stall.
The wireless network, 
the first one at any edu
cational institution in 
the world, uses an inter
face card that fits into 
the PCMCIA slot in por
table computing devices.
It requires no cables and 
no extra telephone jacks.
We have been work
ing with [the] wireless 
[project] on campus for 
several years, but for the 
last six months we have 
been preparingfor a pro
duction roll-out of the 
wireless service, said 
Tracy Futhey, the execu
tive director of Comput
ing Services. At the mo
ment it is only a research 
network, but as of October 1 it 
will be a production network. 
That involves training people 
who work in the Computer Help 
Center as well as working with 
contractors to install access 
points, said Futhey.
Functional access points are lo
cated in Cyert Hall and Hamburg 
Hall, and additional access points 
are being installed in 10 more 
buildings: Baker Hall, Porter Hall,

CMU students will become the first to 
browse the Web without wires.
Doherty Hall, Wean Hall, Posner/ 
GSIA, the University Center, 
Hunt Library, CFA, Scaife Hall, 
and 4902 Forbes. These will be 
ready by October 1.
By the end of this semester, 
Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Hall,
Margaret Morrison, and the 
Mellon Institute will also be 
online. Computing Services is 
deploying 400 access points to 
eventually cover the entire cam
pus. The network service will be 
available in academic and re
search buildings, as well as ar
eas around the main campus.
To use the service, the interface 
card (Lucent WaveLAN Silver 
card, a wireless Ethernet card) 
can be purchased at the Com
puter Store for $260. The inter
face card can be used on any laptop 
or hand-held device running Win
dows 95, 98, Windows NT, 
Macintosh, Linux, or Windows 
CE. The speed of the network is 1 
to 2 Mbps. Outlets also need to be 
registered, and you have to change 
the network setup if you already 
have a network set in Windows. 
The configuration is the same as 
that for Ethernet connections.
Ross Higashi, a first-year in 
the Scholar of Humanities and 
Sciences program, regularly uses 
the wireless service to video-con
ference with his high school friend 
at MIT, download files from the 
Web, check his email, and play a 
few games of Starcraft. The com
bination of convenience, accessi
bility, and [the] sheer nifty factor 
mean that I dont regret [the ex
pense] one bit, he said. He added 
that even though the system

Last Tuesday around midnight, 
part of Morewood A through D 
Towers lost their water supply 
and network connections. On the 
first floor of Morewood D-Tower, 
in the suite adjoining rooms 1D1 
and 1D2, there was a noise that 
sounded like a shower curtain 
had fallen.
Tiffany Chang, a first-year com
puter science major who lives in 
1D1, heard the noise, went into 
the bathroom and noticed that 
the sink had fallen off the wall. I 
called Campus Police to report 
our situation, she said.
The sink had fallen off of its 
bracket in the wall. As it fell, it 
broke the water pipe that it was 
connected to. This caused a sud
den rush of hot water to come 
through the pipes and all over their 
bathroom and adjoining rooms.
The water was on for about 
half an hour, said David Myers, 
assistant director for facilities for 
Housing Services. During that
time, we called Central Property 
Services to come to clean up and 
turn off the water. We have a 
company on retainer with commercial-grade equipment. They 
came with industrial-strength 
dehumidifiers and fans to dry out 
the carpets and rugs for the first 
floor of Morewood.
One of the largest problems was 
when the water went down to the 
Data Communications room in 
the bottom of D-Tower. One piece 
of machinery and many wires 
were damaged as water seeped 
through the equipment.
Data Communications re
sponded quickly and effectively, 
said Myers. They replaced the 
damaged equipment and fixed the 
wires on Wednesday morning. 
The network was working again 
later that afternoon.
It was an inconvenience for 
me and my other suitemates, 
said Chang. We were displaced 
and slept in Mudge for one night 
because of the loud equipment 
they had to dry out everything. 
Luckily most of my things were
off the ground at the time. Some 
of my suitcases and shoes 
became wet, though. The 
electronics in their room were 
off the ground at , the time of 
the accident, so the damage 
was limited.
Housing Services is still not 
sure what the total amount of 
damage will be. However, Myers 
said that the students are re
sponsible for the property in their 
own rooms.
We did get our floor mopped 
and cleaned, though, said Chang. 
Now our floor is slightly warped, 
but other than that there was not 
too much damage to our room.
A computer monitor and CPU, 
keyboard, several phones, elec
trical sweepers, office furniture, 
and carpeting were also damaged 
in the Housing Maintenance Of
fice by the water leak.
According to a police report of 
the incident, a residential census 
form had been sent to Housing 
one week prior to the start of the 
semester notifying that the sink 
was loose and in need of repair.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Penn.(UWIRE)/Daily Collegian  Theres a 
new millennium bug out there, and 
its trying to crash fraternities around 
the nation. However, Phi Delta Theta 
wont let the dry bug bring them down.
Phi Delta Theta will be a dry frater
nity as of July 1, 2000. This means 
alcohol of any kind will not be permit
ted on Phi Delta Theta property. This 
step, initiated by the national organi
zation, will force all 170 fraternities 
across the world to look for another 
facility for any events at which alco
hol is served.
We encourage them to locate alter
nate facilities on or off campus to rent 
out to host an event with alcohol, if 
they choose to, but also keep the chap
ter facilities for events without alco
hol, said Chris Cortina, leadership 
consultant for Phi Delta Theta Inter
national.
Cortina is at the fraternity house 
this week to council them on recruit
ment, membership, and alumni rela
tions. During his visit, Cortina focused 
on helping the members sell a future 
dry house to prospective members.
In the midst of rush, Phi Delta Theta 
is concerned about the alcohol-free 
mandate, and they have reason to be
 last spring semester they had no 
prospective members.
We had no rushes last spring. We 
felt that was because people heard we 
were going dry and it scared them 
because they didnt understand what 
it meant to go dry, said Chris 
Hindinger, president of the fraternity.
Nelson Leong, rush chair for Phi 
Delta Theta, said they wont know 
how rush numbers will be affected 
this semester until bids come out.
In response to the rush numbers, 
Hindinger wrote a letter last summer 
to the national organization asking for 
an extension, but it responded by sayingno exceptions wouldbe made. How
ever, members are determined to keep 
up morale despite requirements.
For a while we thought, What can 
we do to stop it? But now we have to 
find a way to survive, said John 
Stewart, a member of the fraternity.
The organization is finding that sur
vival depends on the brotherhood of 
the house and the close bonds the 
members establish.
You might go to a house with 60 or 70 
guys in a house, but not as close as this 
one. We are 35 strong. I want to be able 
to have a house to come back to. We 
have about 1,300 alumni  none of us 
want the tradition to die, Stewart said.
The organization realizes it may 
not attract men who party often with 
alcohol, but rather a mix of men seek
ing out brotherhood.
We attract the work-hard, playhard type. We put a lot of effort into 
this house, but we also know how to 
have a good time, Stewart said.
Some members at other fraterni
ties believe the individual chapters, 
not the national organizations, should 
make the decision to go dry.
We seem to be handling ourselves 
with the alcohol. We would disaffiliate 
with our national organization before 
going dry, said Jared Barnett, a mem
ber of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity.
At the same time Phi Delta Theta 
found out they were going dry, Phi 
Gamma Delta fraternity and Sigma 
Nu fraternity were informed by their 
national organizations that they were 
to do the same.
However, Sigma Nus national orga
nization voted at its national conven
tion that chapters did not have to go dry 
unless 75 percent of the national frater
nities at their respective schools go dry. 
As a result of the vote, Sigma Nu will 
not be an alcohol-free fraternity house.
Phi Gamma Deltas national orga
nization voted that if fraternities could 
uphold a set of standards, they did 
not have to go dry. The standards 
include a house grade point average 
higher than that of the universitys 
all-fraternity average GPA.
Barbeque honors 
former gangsters
SEATTLE (AP)  The barbecue 
cleared up a lot for Roc Caldwell.
Who got killed, why they got killed, 
stuff like that, explained the Black 
Gangster Disciples member as he stood 
in line for hot dogs and spaghetti along 
with other gang members, all chatting 
with each other as their children ran 
circles around the grassy park.
Theyre not arguing, not fighting. 
Theyre paying respect, said Caldwell, 
who was shot and wounded by a rival 
gang 10 years ago.
Organizer Tim McGee counted on the 
respect. A former leader of the Black 
Gangster Disciples, he used his street 
experience to bring members of rival 
gangs together for a peaceful celebra
tion Saturday.
Called Remembering the Homiez: 
Family Reunion, the barbecue attracted 
a crowd of at least 300 to Edwin T. Pratt 
Park in central Seattle.
One thing gang members do is they 
respect their slain peers, said McGee, 
27, a youth leader at Mount Calvary 
Christian Center. He and his church 
sponsored the barbecue to remember 
the dead, to honor their families, and  
he hop edto lure a few souls away from 
the gang life that nearly killed him.
My goal is to let these people see they 
have a purpose in life, he said. Every
one can change their life.
Before a rap artist and a gospel choir 
performed, McGee called the families of 
the dead to the front of the stage. He 
read off the names of the victims  
Boom-Boom, Baby Huey, Miami, 
and Wolf  as the crowd grew quieter 
and dr6w closer.
We want to keep their memory, he 
said. No matter what gang youre in, 
no matter what life you live, regard
less of what happened to them, we 
remember them.
Tanna Jones, 19, studied a plaque 
listing the names afterward. She grew 
up in Seattles central area, and she 
recognized about half the list. One was a 
cousin, one an ex-boyfriend, another a 
friend. The oldest person she saw on the 
list was 24 when he died, she said.
Its bad to say, but you get used to it.
You get immune, she said. The barbe
cue gave her and other families a way to 
grieve and feel recognized for their loss. 
And, like McGee, she holds out hope that 
the barbecue could change some 
gangbangers hearts, at least a little.
The fact that the different neighbor
hoods are talking and getting along, 
thats a step there, she said.
About eight police officers kept watch 
on the barbecue, but the celebration was 
peaceful. While Seattle still has gang 
activity, gang violence has declined from 
a peak in the 1980s, police spokeswoman 
Carmen Best said. The major activity 
has shifted from shoot-outs to economic 
dominance, she said.
As former gangbanger Caldwellwho 
now runs a graphics arts company  
put it, looking at the varied crowd, 
Maybe theyll take some of this home 
with them.
Justice may not 
return for duty
WASHINGTON (AP)  Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 
being treated for colon cancer, and it is 
unknown when she will be able to return 
to work.
Ginsburg, 66, underwent surgery Fri
day at the Washington Hospital Center. 
She is expected to remain hospitalized 
for about a week, court spokeswoman 
Kathy Arberg said.
Ginsburg, who had been a pioneering 
advocate for womens rights, became 
the second woman ever to serve on the 
nations highest court, joining Justice 
Sandra Day OConnor on the bench, 
when appointed by President Clinton 
in 1993.
She since has found a comfortable ideo
logical home somewhere left of center on 
a conservative court dominated by Re
publican appointees.
When she joined the court, Ginsburg 
was the first justice chosen by a Demo
cratic president in 26 years  since 
Lyndon Johnson named Thurgood 
Marshall in 1967.
Arberg said Ginsburgs doctor, 
colorectal surgeon Lee Smith, did not 
speculate on whether the justices medi
cal treatment would prevent her from 
rejoining the court before the start of its 
1999-2000 term on October 4.
A statement released by the court did 
not assess the surgerys success and 
offered no long-term prognosis. When 
asked, Arberg said, This is the extent of 
the information we have at this time.
Colon cancer is one of the most com
mon cancers in the United States and 
the second-leading cancer killer, be
hind lung cancer. The American Can
cer Society estimates that 131,000 
Americans will be diagnosed this year 
with colorectal cancer  cancer of the 
large intestine or the rectum. About 
56,000 will die.
The most common treatment is surgi
cal removal of the cancerous part of the 
colon and any nearby lymph nodes where 
the cancer has spread. Post-surgical ra
diation is often prescribed to kill any 
leftover tumor cells and decrease the 
chances of a recurrence.
Arberg said Ginsburg felt ill while 
teaching in Crete this summer as part of 
a program run by Tulane Universitys 
law school. While there, she was diag
nosed as suffering from acute diverticu
litis, an intestinal inflammation.
It was not until Ginsburg sought treat
ment at the Washington Hospital Cen
ter that the cancer diagnosis was made.
The Supreme Court got a head start 
on its new term last week when it issued 
orders granting review to a half-dozen 
cases to be argued this winter. There 
was no indication that Ginsburg did not 
participate in considering those cases.

DILI, Indonesia (AP)  
The commander of the 
multinational peacekeeping force 
promised East Timors terrorized 
population Sunday a new life 
free of threat, with his troops 
set to enter the province 
early Monday.
As thousands of troops sailed 
toward Dili, Australian Maj. 
Gen. Peter Cosgrove toured 
streets devastated by rampag
ing militias, passing charred 
houses and buildings reduced to 
smoking ashes.
This is not a time for idle 
threats or words, he said after 
meeting the Indonesian military 
commander of the territory. 
This is a time for the force to 
arrive, and to get about its tasks 
of helping to create a secure
environment. We will be here to 
ensure that all East Timorese 
are able to go about their busi
ness free of threat.
The announcement two weeks 
ago that 78.5 percent of East 
Timors voters approved a break 
with Indonesia led to a murderous 
rampage by pro-Indonesia militias 
that drove more than 300,000 
people from their homes, and cost 
at least several hundred lives.
The foreign intervention is a 
major humiliation for Indone
sia, whose army had fought for 
nearly 25 years to put down 
separatist rebels. It also bodes 
ill for the nations future, as 
separatists elsewhere in the eth
nically diverse archipelago take 
heart from the success of the 
East Timorese.
President B.J. Habibies deci
sion to invite the peacekeepers 
a week ago has led to a national
ist backlash in Indonesia, and 
has sent angry protesters into 
the streets.
Humanitarian aid to hundreds 
of thousands of refugees, some of 
them facing starvation, was to be 
the first priority of the U.N.-approved peace mission.
The first combat troops in the 
7,500-member force were due to 
arrive at 6:30 am local time Mon
day (6:30 pm EDT Sunday) 
aboard a C-130 Hercules trans
port plane, beginning a mission 
that Australian Prime Minister 
John Howard said was fraught 
with menace.
By Monday afternoon, 2,500 
Australian soldiers, helicopters,
and armored personnel carriers 
would be on the ground in Dili, 
said Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, 
commander of the Indonesian 
forces in East Timor.
Nine warships, from Austra
lia, Britain, and New Zealand, 
were sailing toward East Timor. 
About 250 Gurkhas, Nepalese 
fighters who serve in the Brit
ish army and carry their trade
mark 13-inch kukri knives, also 
were to be among the first inter
national troops.
Cosgrove said the force would 
have 3,200 troops in East Timor 
within a week. The mission will 
probably last several months be
fore making way for a follow-up 
U.N. peacekeeping force, he said.
Cosgrove flew from Darwin, 
the staging port in northern
Australia where troops from a 
score of countries were assem
bling. He was greeted on the 
tarmac at Dili airport by 
Syahnakri, the Indonesian com
mander, whom he met for 90 
minutes to coordinate the de
ployment. Cosgrove was 
guarded by seven Australian sol
diers in full battle gear.
Indonesian soldiers were posted 
every 200 yards along Cosgroves 
route as he went on a 20-minute 
tour. Visible effort had been made 
to clear away rubble and other 
evidence of the rioting, looting, 
and killing.
While Cosgrove toured the city, 
the few militiamen who have not 
left brandished machetes as fami
lies hurried aboard crowded In
donesian navy vessels and rusty
cargo ships.
Thousands of homeless people | 
huddled under tarpaulins along I 
a narrow strip of beach. Some i! 
looked out to sea for the foreign 
warships on their way from north- i j 
era Australia.
We are staying here... because I 
we heard that the U.N. troops j I 
will come, said Frederico deli 
Jesus, 18, who was on the beach. ! 
They will bring peace. We will be! | 
safer then.
Hundreds of supporters of In-1 j 
donesian rule, many of them the; 
wives and children of soldiers,'! 
waited in line to catch chartered; 
flights shuttling out to neighbor-; j 
ing West Timor, where tens of; I

50 YEARS AGO, October 4, 
1949  The Scot, a new 64-page 
magazine, announced its debut to 
the Carnegie Tech community. The 
new magazine was to contain fea
ture articles relevant to all stu
dents, supplemented by pictures 
galore.Thirty percentofthe maga
zine would be devoted to current 
news, 20 percent to fiction and 15 
percent to humor. An additional 
15 percent would be allotted to 
sports coverage. The Scot did not 
intend to replace the former hu
mor magazine, The Scottie.
25 YEARS AGO, September 24, 
1974  Lee Cooprider, a Student 
Senator, proposed a quality of life 
survey in order to examine stu
dents life on campus, and possi
bilities for betterment. This sur
vey was a follow-up to a resolution 
that Student Senators should take
a more active role in the commu
nity. This survey would examine

10 YEARS AGO, September 19, 
1989 - A master key to Mudge 
House was stolen from its front 
desk, along with laundry tokens 
valued at $232.25. The desk atten
dant said that she had to leave her 
shift early, so the desk was unat
tended between 1:30 and 4:30 pm. 
Notices were posted by Campus 
Police and the Housing Office, in
forming residents that a key had 
been stolen. Security measures were 
increased by Campus Police, and a 
new lock system for Mudge was 
implemented the following Friday.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Septem
ber 19,1994  Former art profes
sor Harry Holland passed away
after a six-year struggle with can
cer. Holland began teaching at 
CMU in 1963. Holland created 
the software program Panda, for 
computer imagery. Holland re
ceived his Masters of Fine Arts 
from the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology in 1963, for painting. 
Holland earned the Henry 
Hornbostel College of Fine Arts 
Teaching Award in 1982 for his 
diligent work with students.
ONE YEAR AGO, September

announced a revived practice for 
commencement for the graduat

grees could be awarded to indi
viduals in the fields of Doctor of 
Fine Arts, Doctor of Business Prac
tice, Doctor of Humane Letters, 
Doctor of Public Policy, and Doctor 
of Science and Technology. Stu

stated that individuals who have; 
made significant contributions to; }|

WIRELESS, from page 1
hasnt gone into full operation yet, the 
wireless service has worked superbly, for 
the most part.
Once the UC and DH segments are 
online, I dont think Ill ever have to fight 
my way to a cluster PC again... at least, 
until my laptop becomes obsolete, said 
Higashi. Although the system uses the 
older 2 Mbps technology instead of the 11 
Mbps protocols that are emerging now, I 
think the bandwidth is still very decent, 
and the marginal tradeoff for most appli
cations, save huge FTP transfers, is well 
worth the ability to roam freely.
According to Chuck Bartel, director of 
operations at Computing Services, the 
wireless project started six years ago in 
collaboration with Lucent technologies. 
In 1994, Wireless Andrew 1, the first of 
the wireless connections, was built as a 
research network. Last year, Comput
ing Services built Wireless Andrew 2, 
the network which will be available to 
the campus as the production network. 
Access points were not that expensive to 
install, according to Bartel. The entire 
project, if not for a $550,000 research 
grant from the National Science Foun
dation, would probably have cost one 
million dollars. CMU is the largest site 
that has wireless service.
This is a commercial product so any 
company can buy into this and install it.
And there are a number of cooperations 
around the world that have actually 
bought into wireless and employed it, 
however, they have not done it to the 
scale that we have, said Alex Hills, Vice 
Provost of Computing Services. In most 
cases they do it to a building or maybe a 
couple of buildings, [but] we have the 
goal of having access in all of the aca
demic and research buildings on campus 
and cover[ing] the outdoor areas as well. 
Our experience so far with Wireless 
Andrew has been quite good, and we 
expect the network to scale very well 
for casual, roaming use, said Futhey. 
Normal network use across the cam
pus is not likely to cause serious [satu
ration] problems.
On September 17 at 11:29 pm, Higashi 
sent an email from his laptop. It read: I 
would probably tell most people out 
there to keep an eye on this technology. 
Some day, this will be a standard fea
ture on every mobile computing device 
you buy, from laptops to pocket organiz
ers to wristwatches. CMU is one of the 
very first institutions anywhere to have 
a fully functional wireless network, so

to NickFitzkee, the Cam

major, Senate had in
tended to set this table 
up since last year and 
plans to solicit feedback 
in this way every other

table was in response to 
student reaction to the 
parking motions and said 
that the connection was 
purely coincidental.
Weve been getting a

since [the parking issue]

Fitzkee said that among other things,

Similar sentiments were expressed 
by Adam Harber, a first-year business

missing the point.
The objections of the 
student body are not on 
the grounds that they 
do not want to give up 
the few cents from their 
Activities Fee for the 
permits. Rather, they 
are upset at the prin
ciple of what they see 
as unfair entitlements

Crime and Incident Report
9/10 FIRE, 4:45 pm - FMS employees 
and Campus Police investigated the 
Physical Plant following the detection of 
a odor of smoke from within. Construc
tion workers had been welding an over
head pipe, and had caught a piece of 2x4 
on fire. A fire engine responded, and an 
FMS worker poured numerous buckets 
of water upon the piece of affected wood.
9/12 SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, 2:25 
am - Three males were observed standing 
near the Consortium building, by the rail
road tracks. One male was attempting to 
light a long twig on fire with a cigarette 
lighter. It appeared that the males were 
inside the fence that surrounds the prop
erty, and the Campus Police officer on the 
scene phoned for backup. The officer be
lieves he was seen by the males, because 
they left the area after looking into the 
stairwell. He exited the building and was 
unable to find the males. A check of the 
surrounding area proved unsuccesful for 
the persons in question. There was no prop
erty damage, and two cold beer cans were 
found on the ground near the fence area.
9/14 THEFT, 8:48 am - A calculator was 
removed from the middle desk drawer of a 
work station in an open community area 
in the Pittsburgh Technology Center.
9/16 HARASSMENT, 2:00 pm - A stu
dent in Cathedral Mansions received a 
harassing phone message on his per
sonal answering machine. The student 
did not recognize the voice of the caller, 
but estimated that he was approximately 
40. He also stated that neither he nor his 
roommate were home at the time the 
caller claimed they were. In the mes
sage, the caller identified himself, stated 
that he was a resident of the floor below, 
and said, Im sick and tired of all the 
banging and clutter coming from your 
room. I dont know if youre a- f-king, 
or... whatever the f-k youre doing up 
there. I almost called the police on you, 
so it better stop. If not, you will have 
trouble, so heed my warning, boys.
Since this was the only call received, it is 
not considered to be harassment. A check 
with the front desk clerk of Cathedral 
Mansions of the housing rosters proved 
negative for the name given by the caller.
9/16 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 10:30 
am - A resident of Henderson House, 
while in the basement, encountered an 
unknown male, who attempted to strike 
up a conversation with her. The male 
inquired about her roommates, asking 
for them by name. She told him that they 
were not in, and that she did not know 
their current location. He replied, I was 
really hoping I could see them today. He 
then exited the building.

Two weeks ago, Student Senate 
voted to allocate money for a park
ing spot for their Chair while sup
porting a similar measure for the 
Student Body President (SBP) 
and Student Body Treasurer 
(SBT). But instead of passing 
unnoticed like many other Sen
ate actions, these two pieces of 
legislation sparked an outcry from 
the student body. Even though a 
consistently responsive populace 
would be ideal, it is refreshing to 
see a large part of campus blow 
the whistle on an issue they dis
agree with and follow through 
with a petition. However, the re
sponse of some student body offic
ers and senators to the constitu
ents who voted for them has been 
disappointing and undignified.
Student dissent began last week 
with the posting of messages op
posing the action to electronic bul
letin boards and distribution lists. 
This effort became unified when 
former Student Senator Michael 
Strauss started a petition demand
ing that Senate reconsider the is
sue. Word of the petition spread 
quickly, and two days later, 
Strauss presented 1,000 signa
tures  representing about 20 
percent of the student body, twice 
the number required for reconsid
eration  to Student Senate.
Instead of building upon this 
sudden increase of interest in cam
pus government activities by en
couraging healthy debate, several 
leaders have tried to suppress 
contrary opinions. The SBT, 
through a series of mass emailings 
and postings, called the petition

Career preparation is a vital part 
of any colleges educational mis
sion. At a school like CMU, which 
prizes professional knowledge and 
training so highly, such guidance 
is particularly important. The im
provements made to the Career 
Center in the past year are espe
cially worthy of commendation. 
The Center has added new ser
vices, made some ofits old services 
easier to use, and has increased 
communication with students so 
they can take advantage of these 
changes to the fullest.
TartanTRAK, the Web gateway 
that allows students to submit 
online resumes, search for jobs, 
and sign up for interviews with 
visiting companies, drew many 
complaints in the past, ranging 
from limited formatting support 
to security issues. However, the 
site has been revamped in response 
to student criticism. The new 
TartanTRAK runs faster and is 
easier to navigate. Also, while the 
system previously gave students 
very little flexibility in the design 
of their online resumes, it now 
accepts resume files in a variety of 
formats so they can be viewed by 
potential employers. This new fea
ture allows students to upload their 
resumes directly from files cre
ated in common applications, 
rather than having to create a 
simplified, less attractive version.
The Career Center has also 
taken other steps to increase its 
programming and make students 
more aware of it. For instance,

perhaps the greatest waste of 
student energy this University 
could be seeing at this time. Some 
Senators have insisted that stu
dents are misinformed on the is
sue and their dissent should con
sequently be dismissed, and oth
ers labeled it an attempt to in
timidate Senate into acting be
fore it could collect sufficient feed
back itself. Rather than make 
such assumptions about the stu
dents they represent, these Sena
tors should take the petition seri
ously and listen closely to their 
constituents wishes. More stu
dents signed the petition than 
voted in the last student govern
ment election, which clearly indi
cates that the student body cares.
However, there have also been 
Senators who have chosen to lis
ten to the studentsvoices. Through 
email and conversations with 
passers-by, these representatives 
have tried not only to gauge how 
many students disagree with the 
decision, but also to see why their 
constituents do not like it and what 
can be done about it. This out
reach to collect the opinions of 
those they represent should have 
been started much earlier, but it is 
inspiring to see that some lines of 
communication remain open.
The student body has spoken, 
and now it falls to Senate to lis
ten. In the interest of keeping 
students interested in campus 
affairs and serving their instrests, 
it is critical for this newfound 
lively channel between the gover
nors and the governed to remain 
consistently intact.

Last weeks front

nities face criminal 
complaints has been 
the latest in a longthe mock interview program al
lows students to have practice 
interviews with representatives 
of real companies, who give feed
back on their performances. While 
the Career Center has offered this 
helpful service in previous years, 
it has made more of an effort to 
reach students by email this fall, 
sending messages through aca
demic departments that explain 
when the interviews are and what 
one has to do to sign up.
Another positive Career Center 
innovation was CMUs first mock 
job fair, held last Monday. This 
event gave students much-needed 
practice interacting with poten
tial employers and provided a 
warm-up for the Technical Op
portunities Conference, the Busi
ness Opportunities Conference, 
and other upcoming job fairs.
In addition to stepping up its 
publicity for the mock interviews, 
the Career Center has done a bet
ter job this year of reaching out to 
students in general. Career Cen
ter representatives have made 
visits to classes to explain what 
services they provide and have 
increased student awareness of 
specific events via email.
The Career Center improvements 
make the center better able to serve 
its crucial role  preparing stu

the working worid. As such, these 
improvements demonstrate the

ion, they have done little or nothing to 
improve their rapport with a campus 
institution just six years younger than 
The Tartan itself. However, this most 
recent article far exceeds the bound
aries of freedom of opinion, making 
dangerous inroads into the realms of 
unethical journalism and malicious ad
vancement of agendas. Our only hope is 
that the campus community can recog
nize the ulterior motives held by The 
Tartans journalists and withhold judge
ment until justice is served.
Until justice is served. That concept 
may no longer be possible given The 
Tartans irresponsible article. If the fra
ternities in question are eventually dealt 
with internally, via perhaps a Judicial 
Board hearing, is there any way they 
can expect to find an impartial jury? For 
this reason, the Crime and Incident Re
ports omit the names of all parties in
volved; privacy issues being another rea
son. The Tartan article in question reads 
like an extended C&I report, yet for 
some reason the names of the fraterni
ties and their presidents were included. 
Names absent from the report were ex
clusively those of underage students al
legedly consuming alcohol, thus also vio
lating Pennsylvania state law. Their 
rights to privacy and fair trial have been 
upheld, whereas ours have been bla
tantly disregarded. Furthermore, there 
has been more than one occasion in 
recent semesters in which fraternities 
received probation sentences for various 
alcohol violations, but articles about 
them were not printed until after judge
ment had been passed. Thus, the previ
ously stated facts lead one to wonder if 
The Tartan printed this article without 
consulting the proper authorities.
Why, then, would The Tartan print 
such an article when they have histori
cally waited until the internal judicial 
process has run its course? The answer 
is uncertain, although let us propose the 
following questions that may be indica
tive of an alarming trend:
Why has the number of articles in
volving Greeks substantially decreased 
over the past few years, to the point that 
virtually all Greek Tartan exposure ap
pears in the Crime and Incident Re
ports? Why has the amount of Booth, 
Buggy, Greek Sing, Mr. Fraternity, and 
other Greek philanthropy coverage de
creased substantially semester after se
mester? Why does The Tartan uphold a 
policy that none of the Tartan 
staffwriters, photographers, etc. who are 
members of the Greek community may 
publish anything in The Tartan that 
remotely mentions their own houses?
Why, immediately following the final 
weekend of Fraternity Rush, one of the 
most important and exciting weekends 
for both Greeks and the many nonGreeks who regularly visit the Quad, 
were there not any articles relating to 
Rush? Why have recent editorials on 
Greek issues written by The Tartan edi
torial board been consistently negative? 
Above all, why does it seem that The 
Tartan likes to either disregard or 
downplay the positive impact that 16 
percent of the undergraduate popula
tion has on this campus? If only one or 
two of the above claims were actually 
happening, we could conclude that this 
all is one big coincidence, and the staff at 
The Tartan does not necessarily hate 
everything that has to do with Greek 
organizations. Since, however, all of the 
above have been occurring, [and] The 
Tartan printed an article that could jeop
ardize fair internal judicial actions for 
Sigma Nu and Phi Kappa Theta, it is 
reasonable to accuse The Tartan of us
ing its influential position to advance an 
anti-Greek agenda. Both Greeks and 
the entire campus community deserve 
an explanation or some resignations.
David Dybes, President 
James Lampe, Vice President 
Phi Kappa Theta
[Ed. note: The Tartan does not, nor has 
it ever, maintained an anti-Greek agenda. 
To address a number of the points Mr. 
Dybes and Mr. Lampe bring up:
The only names that were mentioned 
in last weeks article Fraternities face 
criminal complaints are those of the 
presidents of the two fraternities involved. 
Both of these names are a matter of 
public recordany student who wished 
to find them out could do so. The names 
of the houses involved were mentioned 
because the two incidents covered were 
major incidents  at least one student 
received medical attention from CMUEMS and Pittsburgh paramedics.
Coverage of Booth, Buggy, and Greek 
Sing in the 1998-99 academic year was 
consistent with coverage given to these 
events in the past. For coverage of Booth 
and Buggy, please see the April 12,1999 
and April 19, 1999 editions of The Tar
tan (Volume 93, Issues 22 and 23). For 
coverage of Greek Sing, please see the 
March 15 edition (Volume 93, Issue 20). 
And an article on Rush and the Greek 
system in general was published in Tan
gent, The Tartan's orientation maga
zine, August 1999. All of these are avail
able for review in archives in The Tartan 
office, UC 314.
No editorials pertaining to the Greek 
system have been written by the current 
editorial board, which took office in Janu
ary 1999. Columns running in the Fo
rum section pertaining to these issues 
represent only the opinion of the indi
vidual writer, not that of the editorial 
board.
The policy of not having Greek staff 
members cover Greek events is not unique 
to these organizations. No staff member 
may cover any story pertaining to any 
organization of which he/she. is a mem
ber, as it represents a conflict of interest.
However, all staff members are en
couraged to refer story ideas about groups 
they are in to the appropriate editor, who 
may then assign them to a staff member 
who has no such conflict. Similarly, all 
members of the campus community are
encouraged to contact The Tartan to 
advise us of events of interest.]
Christianity, free 
will can reconcile
Editor:
In the August 30 
edition of The Tartan, 
an article was pub
lished entitled Free 
will continues in
Letter to 
the Editor
Christian Heaven. As a Christian on 
campus, I would like to point out that 
many or all of the articles claims about 
Christianity and Heaven and Hell were 
written out of an ignorance concerning 
the Christian faith. The article began by 
calling Heaven a magical kingdom. 
Heaven, however the Christian view
point on it is misunderstood, is not 
Disneyworld. The article then goes on to 
declare that faith in Jesus Christ is  
no-risk proposition and that if Jesus is 
not the Savior and Gods Son, then 
youve only wasted a little time believ
ing a silly Bible story. This summary of 
faith couldnt be further from the truth. 
As a child, back when I thought that 
going to church made me a Christian 
and belief in Jesus meant ascribing to 
some nice guy who carried sheep around, 
I too believed that faith meant a no-lose 
situation. But it doesnt, and I will try to 
explain why.
In Hebrews, the author writes Now 
faith is being sure of what we hope for 
and certain of what we do not see. And 
without faith, it is impossible to please 
God, because anyone who comes to him 
must believe that he exists and that he 
rewards those who earnestly seek him.! 
(Heb. 11:1,6) Faith is being certain. The 
act of faith is not to stand in the middle 
.of two choices, never fully committed to 
either, and to always be ready to leap to 
one side or the other at the last minute 
should one prove true or false. By choos
ing not to fully believe, a person is by 
default choosing not to believe at all. 
Paul says, concerning faith and salva
tion, that you continue to work out y oui' 
salvation with fear and trembling. (Phil. 
2:12) Faith in Jesus Christ is not  
passive acceptance, but rather an active 
choice. A person who is presented with 
Jesuss life, death, and resurrection has 
two choices. That person can believe 
that There is no difference, for all have 
sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
and are justified freely by his grace 
through the redemption that came by 
Christ Jesus.(Romans 3:22-25) Or that 
person can choose to not believe Jesus is 
who He says He is  I am the bread of 
life.... I am the living bread that came 
down from heaven. This bread is my 
flesh which I will give for the life 
of the world. (John 6:48,51) A person 
can believe in this man, Jesus, as th 
Redeemer of Mankind, the one true 
Saviour, God and Man, or he/she can 
choose not to believe. There is no half
way or in-between. The articles discus
sion is based on an erroneous under
standing of Christian faith. But then, 
no one can see the Kingdom of Go 
unless he is born again. (John 3:3)

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  20 September 19997
SmymW.9.Ie iInnmai.sy 9meu9 u.9olaw.eC nm99sCm
ture the stars of each scene with 
proud and dignified expressions 
on their faces. Then the screen 
goes black and slowly this sen
tence appears: MTV: The Spirit 
of Being Young.
I have to admit I am --------
these all-too-realistic portrayals 
that MTV understands the youth 
of today and thinks that their 
actions are cool? These questions 
have made me doubt, yet again, 
the integrity of the media.
We become what the advertisers 
want us to be: slovenly, unques
tioning consumers. We drink our 
Slurpees, buy our Tommy Hilfiger 
sweatshirts, and never stop 
watching TV.
Here is description of the MTV 
commeral I saw while watching 
the MTWideo Music Awards. It 
was seto a hip and modern 
techno bit. First scene: A group 
of out-o^shape, pierced boys 
laugh mjkingly behind a fence 
at high-chool track runners. 
Scene t\): A classroom full of 
test-takes leans like vultures 
over a propy-looking Asian girls 
test as sen as the teacher leaves 
the roomlhird scene: A disgust
ingly decdent couple roll all over 
each othc while they play video 
games. Lst scene: An attractive 
blond giiin a darkened bedroom 
steals mney from her sleeping 
lovers wllet. The last shots picSdNw sou trgolgp o cgngrolIvn v 1vanc

the alternate reality on the j 
screen. It is a reality where
cheating, stealing, mocking, and 
decadence are considered accept
able and even encouraged at
tributes of youth culture. I cant 
believe that MTV is overtly irre
sponsible enough to produce a 
commercial that accepts such 
morally deprived behavior. Do 
they want us to steal? Are they 
inciting us to cheat? Or, on an 
even slimier second thought, are 
they trying to appeal to the MTV 
demographic by inferring with
We live in a world where TV 
has replaced religion. It feeds us 
our values and dictates our ac
tions. This commercial is further
ing the attitude held by so many 
of todays youth that school is 
stupid, that being good requires 
too much effort, and that plea
sure is the only thing worth liv
ing for. MTV has created a gen
eration of young adults who dont 
challenge the doctrines passed 
down to them through the media.
I think the media has gone too 
far this time. They have much 
power over our actions already; 
now they have ripped away com
pletely the poorly hinged morals 
that seemed to be governing their 
executive decisions. They arent 
relying on the subconscious mes
sages conveyed by beautiful 
women in alcohol advertisements 
or happy, healthy people in smok
ing advertisements. They have 
gotten to the point where they
just come right out and say it: 
We condone any behavior that 
will sell our products, no matter 
how immoral it may be.
I worry about the future this 
cultural trend is producing. 
Rather than the MTV genera
tion, I think we are the bigger, 
better, faster generation raised 
on phen-fen, Ritalin, email, and 
all the other quick fixes that free 
up our time so we can engage in 
productive activities. How will 
we fend for generations to come if 
our moral backbones have been 
supplanted with anorexia and 
Melrose Place? How will we cre
ate and invent when video games 
and couch-sitting have replaced 
our ingenuity? How will we main
tain the environment when most 
of us dont even recycle?

Frank J. Fleming
Ive had just about enough of toler
ance. It sfemed like a good idea at first, 
everybody respecting the opinions and 
.principlesof others, but then I actually 
started listening to the opinions and 
principlesof others and realized it just 
aint goma work. People have some 
'pretty stu)id ideas  ideas I cant even 
pretend tlere might be some merit to. 
Thats wly I finally recognized toler
ance for wiat it is: just another new-age, 
soulless, iberal buzzword. In reality, 
people jud. want to be tolerant because 
theyie la:y.
' Whit if someone is doing something 
you kiow to be stupid? The easy thing to 
Las is plerate it, because then you dont 
have o do anything. But if youre intol
erant, you have to confront the person 
and ciuse trouble and be disliked, and 
tio om wants that. I know what youre 
probaily thinking: Hey, what gives 
you tfe right to tell people whats right 
-and whats wrong? Well, first of all, 
shut ip, because thats just the idiocy 
Im taking about, but lets pretend you 
mightactually have a point for the sake 
of argunent.
J We lave a right to tell people whats 
wrong with them because we have to
deal with them .all the time. And just 
look at people; theyre pretty stupid, 
aint they, all scampering about wearing 
funny clothing, watching MTV, and try
ing to convince you that socialism could 
work. And why should you have to put 
up with that? As Popeye once said, I can 
stands all I can stands, but I cant stands 
no more!
There is much wisdom in Popeyes 
words, because why do you have to 
stands more than you need to? I mean, 
some things you cant change, so toler
ate that. The sun rising in the morning 
annoys me when Im trying to sleep in, 
but I cant change that  for now  so 
Ill just tolerate it. Good for me. There 
also are a few other things that are just 
a good idea to be tolerant of, like lactose. 
But everything else is up for grabs, and 
it should be. For it is being intolerant 
that makes men great, that makes them 
innovators, that makes them strive to 
change something that really pisses them 
off. We would still be living in caves 
eating figs and berries if some adventur
ous soul hadnt stood up and said, I 
cant tolerate this crap no more! Im 
going to go out, pick up a sharp stick, and 
kill something and eat it. And, if any of 
you pinkos got a problem with that, 
youre next!
And who is the most intolerant one of 
them all? God, of course. He may love all 
mankind (even communists), He may be 
infinitely compassionate (youre still 
here, arent ya?), but one thing He aint 
is tolerant. He made all that is, He
defined what is true to 
be true, so He sure as 
hell isnt open to others 
idiotic opinions. You 
could walk up to Him 
and say, You know, I 
understand what You 
are trying to tell me, 
but isnt truth relative 
from person to person? 
and Hell just stare at 
you silently for a few 
seconds, shout No! 
and then smite you. And 
can you blame Him?
For there is a great 
danger in unbridled tol
erance, as it is a univer
sal fact that there are 
an infinite number of 
stupid ideas out there 
for every good one. A lot 
of the problems we have 
today are probably be
cause people werent intolerant when they 
should have been, thus 
making accepted ideas 
that should have been 
vehemently derided.
So use the sense God 
gave you; next time 
people tell you that 
truth is relative or 
some hippie crap like that, dont wuss 
out and be tolerant. You just shout, 
No! and spit in their faces  but dont 
smite them. Courts wont tolerate that.

Ecitor:
u eagerly awaited 
the first few edi
tions of The Tartan 
in order to see what 
vas new on cam
pus, and to see yhat new insights 
might be gleaned there. I was hope
ful until I stumUed across Yishan 
Wongs column Christianity falsely
Letter to 
the Editor
claims status as victim [September 
7]. New ideas? I only found the old 
and very tired idea that its socially 
acceptable, even sporting, to bash 
Christianity. The good news is 
that there is a small audience for such 
op-ed pieces.
In which classes has it been taught 
that its acceptable to ridicule, belittle, 
and mock others faith traditions? Re
place the word Christianity in Mr. 
Wongs article with Islam or Juda
ism and see if it sounds any less offen
sive. It doesnt. Why then would it be 
socially acceptable to bash Christian
ity? Theres no excuse for it. Sadly, many 
good people have remained silent in the 
face of the virus of anti-Christian preju
dice, thereby giving those that peddle 
such sentiments the misguided notion 
that its perfectly acceptable to continue 
such wanton attacks.
Particularly amusing in the column 
was the phrase overwhelming meta
physical might of secular humanism. 
The choice of the word metaphysical 
is misplaced. Metaphysics deals with 
the transcendent. How can this be 
used to describe secular humanism? It 
hardly fits.
In a pitiful commentary on our times, Mr. 
Wong squarely puts himself in the camp of 
those who would replace authentic freedom 
with license, and the pursuit of virtue with vice. 
Perhaps his piece should have been relegated 
to the trite article in the University Living 
section that dealt with the State of the Union 
with regards to the public lavatories on cam
pus. Then again, banality has become the sta
tus quo at The Tartan.

Between The Uprights
by Pete Patterson
The state of Florida was undoubtedly 
the center of the college football uni
verse this weekend. Saturdays slate of 
games included #4 Florida hosting #2 
Tennessee, #3 Penn State visiting #9 
Miami, and Florida State playing host 
to the team which handed them an em
barrassing loss last year, #20 NC State. 
Each of these games has the potential to 
loom large in the national title hunt.
That this is the case is what makes 
college football so great. Every game is 
meaningful. Just ask Ohio State, who 
after a first-game loss to Miami will 
have to combine an undefeated record 
with a lot of luck the rest of the way to 
find a way back into the title picture. Do 
you think the Denver Broncos or the 
Atlanta Falcons are feeling the same 
type of pressure after week-one losses? 
Of course not. The reason? In the NFL, 
12 teams make the annual Super Bowl 
sweepstakes that is the NFL playoffs. 
Go 10-6, slip into the playoffs through 
the wild card, and you have a shot at the
Super Bowl. That type of winning per
centage in the college ranks will earn 
you nothing but an invitation to the 
Outback Bowl.
The bowl system has recently been 
much maligned, with many coaches and 
sportswriters wanting a playoff to deter
mine the national title. This nation defi
nitely has an obsession with having a 
clear-cut champion. Even with the BCS 
system attempting to utilize the power 
of computers and football experts alike 
to match up the top two teams in a title 
game, disagreements still occur. Imag
ine the situation last year had UCLA 
and Kansas State not botched their final 
games of the season and each gone into 
the bowls undefeated along with Ten
nessee. No matter how sophisticated a 
ratings system you use, three teams 
cant play against each other on the 
same day to determine the champion
ship. The bowl system has been defined 
as being a dinosaur hanging on due to 
the thirst for money of college athletic 
directors, robbing the fans of the right
ful national champion which should be 
crowned with a playoff system like every 
other right-minded sport, including all 
the lower divisions of football.
Before writing your local athletic di
rector campaigning for a playoff, con
sider these two points. Weekends such 
as this past one in Florida would no 
longer be possible, and rather than hav
ing the best team crowned champion 
every year, I guarantee the caliber of the
title teams would decline. Re
garding the first point, 
recall the reference I 
made to the NFL. The 
regular season is 
basi
cally a pro
logue to the play
offs, when the real 
season begins. Sud
denly, a game be
tween Tennessee 
and Florida 
during the 
regular 
sea
son would cease to be so important. Win 
or lose, both teams would surely make 
that top-16 cut required to 
make the playoffs (the 
Division III playoffs 
actually include 24 
teams, so this is 
a conservative 
estimate). I 
dont think a 
playoff system 
is worth sacrific
ing the best regu
lar season any sport 
has to offer, with 
literally every 
week having 
games which pro
foundly affect the 
national title chase. 
Especially since a 
playoff would more likely crown 
an. unworthy champion. Con
sider the situation in college bas
ketball. Does anyone think that 
UNLV wasnt-the best team in the 
country in 1992 when they went un
defeated in the regular season? Or that 
Villanova was the nations top team 
when they won the NCAA tourna
ment as an eight-seed in 1985? 
Sure, the tournament may be 
the most exciting event in 
sports, but it cheapens the 
title. A team merely 
needs to have a deMatt Blum/Tartan Art Staff cent season and then
get hot for a couple of weeks to win the 
championship. Had there been a playoff 
last year, would anyone outside of 
Blacksburg have been happy if Virginia 
Tech produced a series of upsets to claim 
the title? I would much rather debate 
the qualifications of two or three worthy 
teams than hand the undisputed title to 
a substandard team.
So, who helped their cause in this 
weeks installment of-the race for the 
title in college football? Penn State barely 
survived for the second straight week, 
beating a tough Miami team 27-23. 
Florida showed Tennessee why no one 
has won in the Swamp for 30 games, 
holding on against last years champi
ons 23-21. And Florida State avenged 
its fluke fall to NC State last year with 
a 41-13 win. Oh yeah, there were some 
games which took place outside of 
Florida. Wisconsin somehow lost to Cin
cinnati, 17-12, while having Ron Dayne 
run for 231 yards. Notre Dame contin
ued their nightmarish start with a loss 
to Michigan State to drop their record to 
1-3. Also, Michigan escaped against 
Syracuse to remain undefeated.
In order to preserve great weekends 
such as this, the bowls must be saved 
and a playoff plan sacked. And, in case 
you arent yet convinced of this, I have 
one question: What would New Years 
day be like without the bowls?

ful responses to his views.cs.a Id v.e9 am9oIam9 9Iiima omsnK9 9oamsr

Nothing eases the pain of a 
tough loss like playing well in 
front of your home fans. The CMU 
womens soccer team was count
ing on that fact last week as they 
looked to rebound from a rough 
series of games that culminated 
with the teams first loss of 
the season.
The turn-around began last 
Tuesday when the team hosted 
the Marietta College Pioneers. 
Still feeling the effects of the pre
vious games disappointing re
sult, the Tartans played tenta
tively throughout most of the 
game, sitting back and waiting 
for offensive opportunities rather 
than creating them.
To make matters worse, many 
of the chances the Tartans did 
get were ruined by miscommunications and poor passes. On sev
eral occasions, two CMU players 
went after the same pass, ensur
ing that neither would get a good 
scoring opportunity.
Despite their problems finish
ing, the Tartans controlled the 
course of play for most of the
game, and finally got the break 
they needed in the eighth minute 
when sophomore midfielder Katie 
Snell headed first-year midfielder 
Melissa McMorrows corner kick 
past the Marietta goalkeeper.
One goal would prove to be all 
the offense the Tartans needed, 
as the defense completely shut 
down the Marietta attack. Firstyear goalkeeper Maya Nigrosh 
faced just one shot in the entire 
game and was never seri
ously tested.
Confident in their defense, the 
Tartans continued to wear away 
at the Marietta defenders, and 
were able to increase their lead 
early in the second half when 
McMorrow stole the ball just out
side the penalty box and ripped a 
shot to the far post. First-year 
forward Susan Pevovar finished 
the scoring in the 3-0 shutout by 
chipping a shot over the goal
keeper off of a cross from junior 
co-captain Kim Celone.
With their confidence restored 
by the impressive win, the team 
looked to start a new winning 
streak against the Purple Raid
ers of Mount Union last Satur
day. In front of perhaps the larg
est home crowd of the season, the 
Tartans didnt disappoint, finish
ing off Mount Union 2-1.
The game was not nearly as 
close as the final score indicated, 
but a few unfortunate breaks kept 
the Tartans sweating until the 
final whistle. CMUs inability to 
finish and a fluke goal by Mount 
Union prevented the Tartans 
from pulling away.
For the first 35 minutes of the 
game, CMU was completely domi
nant. The mental mistakes from 
the Marietta game were gone, 
replaced by intelligent spacing, 
sharp passes, and heads-up play. 
Demonstrating a highly aggres
sive style, the offense created 
multiple chances by sending long 
balls down the sidelines and cross
ing in to the following strikers.
On the other end of the crosses, 
however, the Tartans found them
selves continually frustrated by 
the last line of the Mount Union 
defense. Even with great service 
from the wingers, the CMU for
wards had difficulty getting off 
quality shots, and managed just 
one goal in the first half.
With about 10 minutes left in 
the half, the CMU attack let up
somewhat, allowing Mount Union 
to get back in the game mentally. 
Seeing that they could play with 
CMU, the Mount Union squad 
played a much tougher second 
half, keeping the action balanced 
between both ends of the field.
CMU extended their lead at 
the 30-minute mark of the half 
when the Mount Union goal
keeper misplayed a free kick by 
McMorrow and senior forward
Romy Fischer poked in the re
bound. The goal proved to be cru
cial, as Mount Union finally broke 
through five minutes later. The 
Tartans were unable to clear a 
bouncing corner kick, and Mount 
Union finally put the ball in the 
net on their fourth shot of 
the series.
The Tartans held tough, 
though, and escaped with the win. 
We played physical, and didnt
let up after they scored, Pevo
var said.
Heading into the heart of their 
season, the Tartans are showing 
signs that they will be a force to 
be reckoned with in the UAA this 
year. Were really coming to
gether as a team and getting to 
know each other, sophomore 
back Melissa Manheim said.
The team plays Carlow College 
in their next game Wednesday.

In The Red Zone
by Nathan Steinwald
After two weeks of NFL football, most 
! fans have been left with a sense of verItigo more than anything else. My own 
ihead feels like Boomer Esiasons after 
! Bruce Smith hit him so hard that he had 
! to retire. Do I dare try to make sense of 
! all of the happenings in the league thus 
! far? Im ready to get back into the game.
! So far, the season has undermined the 
! expectations of more teams than reaf! firmed them. Even Jacksonville, who 
blew out the 49ers, only won by three 
! against Carolina. But the Jaguars are 
! still the class of the AFC, and they should 
1 be taking most of their opponents to 
school on a regular basis. A close second, 
and it pains me to say this, is Miami. You 
dont know how much I dislike Miami. 
However, even I cant deny that a win 
against the Broncos in Denver and trim! ming the wings of the Cardinals means 
ithat they are making an early stateiment about the quality of team that 
i they have.
Four other teams in the AFC are unde
feated so far. Pittsburgh, Tennessee,
New England, and San Diego have man
aged to beat their opponents, but have to 
prove that they are among the 
conferences elite.
Pittsburgh gets style points for blow
ing up their rival Cleveland in the first 
week. But it is Cleveland, and they didnt 
dominate the Ravens the way that a 
contender should. The offense just needs 
to move the chains more consistently. 
Tennessee welcomed Cleveland with 
open arms this .week, because it 
would have taken a miracle for the 
Browns to win. The Titans weekone win over Cincinnati was 
equally unimpressive, so they still 
have something to prove. New En
gland barely won both of its games.
San Diego has only played one 
week, beating a hapless Cincin
nati team.
Ive told you about the AFCs 
best, so what about the rest? Well, 
first lets say that we are only done 
with two weeks of the season so far.
In light of that there is a special 
category of team that we will look 
at  the best of the worst, or the 
mediocre in any case. So far, Oak
land gets the award. Despite all of 
the attention Mike Holmgren has 
gotten in Seattle, Oakland has 
looked good against quality NFC 
teams. If they can post a good record 
in their own conference, with Den
ver being their only real obstacle, 
then they will make the playoffs. 
Denver comes in a close second. 
Brian Griese just isnt getting the
job done, and neither are the rest of the 
players around him.
Buffalo and the New York Jets have 
serious questions to answer before they 
can lay claim to a playoff berth. The Jets 
need to prove that they can win without 
Vinny Testaverde, and the Bills need to 
prove that they can win without a run
ning game, because Antowain Smith 
and his torn groin just are not getting 
it done.
In the NFC there is an even larger 
mess to sort through. Detroit is ahead of 
Atlanta and Green Bay even without 
Barry Sanders. Dallas and St. Louis are 
the only other teams undefeated at press 
time. Dallas plays a game today against 
Atlanta. St. Louis is taking this week 
off. What happened to everybody else?
Someone had to win in the AtlantaMinnesota match-up, but it was sad 
that two of the most prolific offenses of
last year could only manage 31 points 
between them. Then, Minnesota goes 
and loses to Oakland? Green Bay was 
lucky to pull it out against Oakland in 
week one, but then they lost to Detroit. 
San Francisco pulled out a win in the 
last two minutes. Oh, how the mighty 
have fallen.
Nathan Steinwald appreciates all 
thoughtful responses to his views.

! Though the U.S. Open is over,
! and there is no Serena Williams 
! and Martina Hingis to entertain 
! thousands of eager womens ten
nis fans, CMUs team has their 
! own ace in the hole. The last two 
i weekends have provided plenty 
I of entertaining matches and some 
i very exciting tennis.
I This Sunday, the team trav' eled to New York to battle Ithaca 
1 College and Swarthmore. The 
1 Ithaca team proved to be too 
! much. Annie Bosler, a sophomore 
! architecture student, lost her 
! match in three sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6- 
i 0. Likewise, computer science se! nior Fani Pavlova and sophomore 
I architecture student Kelly 
Chanopas dropped their singles 
! matches. The doubles teams fared 
a little better, winning two of the 
! three matches. The final score 
! was Ithaca 5, CMU 4.
! The situation was much differ
ent when going up against 
! Swarthmore. CMU won 7 out of 5 
! matches total, bringing their sea
son record to 11. Pavlova man
aged to regain her composure and 
win her match 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
Last Saturday and Sunday, the 
womens tennis team attended a 
preliminary tournament at 
Haverford Colleges Invitational 
Tournament and came back with 
impressive results, dominating 
the majority of brackets. The 
worst result for any of the players 
was third place.
One of the most successful play
ers was Elizabeth Brown, a jun
ior undeclared student in MCS. 
She fought it out in the semifi
nals, pulling through a tie
breaker in the first set, and 
handedly taking the second 6-3. 
From there she faced Alyssa 
Kennedy of Haverford in a show
down between two seeded play
ers. However, Brown had no prob
lem winning the final 7-5, 6-1. 
Brown and Bosler were a dynamic 
duo against Ithaca and 
Swarthmore, winning both their 
matches.
After first winning her first 
match in a three-set extrava
ganza that ended in a exciting
tie-break, Bosler breezed through 
the final match, 6-4, 6-1.
Pavlova brought her experience 
to the court, winning the final 6- 
1,2-6 6-0, also garnering a firstplace result.
The future looks bright for firstyear Liz Higgins, a CIT unde
clared who made her CMU ten
nis debut two weekends ago. 
Rounding out the first-place fin
ishes, Higgens defeated 
Haverfords Swapna Deshpande 
6-2, 6-1.
The story for the rest of the 
CMU team resulted in two semi
final losses.
CMUs Jill Palermo, a sopho
more architecture student, made 
it to the semifinals, but could not 
manage to win the next one, los
ing 7-6, 6-2. She eventually 
placed third in her bracket.
Chanopas also managed to land 
a third-place standing, losing 6- 
4, 6-3.
The mens team will be off until 
the weekend of October 1 when 
they play in the Rolex Tourna
ment at Swarthmore. The women 
play at William Smith Saturday.

After the sun faded back towards the 
West following a warm Saturday in Pitts
burgh, the mighty Tartan mens soccer 
team rested peacefully. They had played 
hard, and as the time came to take the 
shin guards off and become regular stu
dents again, intramurals and weekend 
Olympians were already taking over
Gesling. An unjust departure for the 
team, after two impressive shutout vic
tories against Baldwin-Wallace and 
Mount Union.
We came out at home, and we got the 
job done. We still havent played a full 
90-minute game yet, but with two shut
outs, were happy, said senior 
Ben Kartzman.
On Saturday, Baldwin-Wallace took 
the field with nervous optimism, but left
Brian Yeung/Tartan Photo Staff
The CMU offense exploded for six goals in two matches last week. The defense was 
even more impressive, recording shutouts in both games.
the field in a cloud of frustration and 
disappointment, the victims of a 40 
drubbing by the Tartans. The onslaught 
was led in a blistering quick-punch fash
ion, with all four goals coming in the 
first half of play. Dave Zupon, a junior 
midfielder from nearby Upper St. Clair, 
paced the Tartan offense with a hat 
trick, punctuated by a dazzling header 
off a corner kick in the 35th minute.
Scoring with deadly precision, Zupon 
netted his three goals within a relatively 
short time span, between the 24th and 
43rd minutes of play. In the middle of 
the barrage, another hometown boy 
scored a stunning goal for the Tartans. 
Forward Matt Crummy, a first-year stu
dent from Gibsonia, a northern suburb 
of Pittsburgh, avoided the off-side trap, 
took the through ball, and scored on a 
breakaway in the 36th minute. Slipping 
the ball under the arm of the sprawling 
Baldwin-Wallace goalkeeper, Crummy 
thrilled the crowd with a beautifully 
finished goal.
The Tartan defense was equally as
sertive, shutting down the counterat
tacks of Baldwin-Wallace just as quickly 
as they popped up. Playing aggressively, 
the Tartans outran the opposing Yellow 
Jackets to seemingly every ball and set 
up the offense with precise lead passing. 
At times, the aggressiveness led to some 
precarious free kicks for BaldwinWallace, but goalie Kartzman quickly
tended to any 
problems.
In a remark
ably similar 
game, the Tar
tans defeated 
Mount Union 2-0 
on a chilly 
Wednesday night 
at Gesling Sta
dium. The stu
dent fans were 
vocal, the game 
was fast, and the 
scoringwasledby 
first-year forward 
Matt DiGiacomo.
The game 
went well. Matt 
Crummy gave me 
a good ball on the 
first goal, and 
Doug Jones gave 
me a similar ball 
on the second.
Brian reung/1 artan Knoto staff 
The Tartans won this battle against Mount Union on their way to 
winning the game, 2-0.
Both opportunities needed to be 
finished; they werent difficulty shots, 
said DiGiacomo.
The Tartans played extremely hard, 
fighting for position on every ball. Set
ting their game plan early, they looked 
to send their forwards a through ball 
down the touch line and wait for a cross. 
The game plan worked well, opening up 
opportunities for the oncoming forwards.
While the team enjoys some of its 
early-season success, Kartzman is a little 
more down-to-earth. Were goingto have 
to pull it all together, he said in refer
ence to the upcoming conference games 
against the University of Chicago and 
Washington University.
The Tartans will host Waynesburg 
College on Tuesday before going on the 
road to face Chicago.Ssaose9 amns.e lewmsome .e MInm nmmo9

It was 10 am on a bright Satur
day morning. Most students were 
still asleep, but over at Flagstaff 
Hill the mens and womens cross 
country teams were preparing for 
their second home meet of the 
season. The conditions were much 
more favorable than at their last 
home meet, where sweltering 
heatslowed the runners consid
erably. However, the competition 
was much stiffer than before with 
Grove City, Geneva, and Case 
Western running at this meet.
Defending Carnegie Mellon 
cross countrys 25-year winning 
streak in home dual meets was a 
difficult task, but both teams 
showed that they were up to the 
challenge, taking first in the 
mens and the womens events. 
The womens team ran first and 
received an overall score of 28, 
ahead of Grove Citys 52 points, 
Case Westerns 52 points, and 
Genevas 104 points. The mens 
team followed with an equally
impressive win, finishing with a 
minuscule 19 points.
It was an excellent race with 
good competition from Grove 
City, mens coach Gary Meckley 
said. He also said that, although 
he was very pleased overall, he 
would have liked to have seen the 
mens team continue 
to run in groups to
ward the end of the 
race. This would 
help the slower run
ners finish in less 
time, since they 
would be paced by 
the faster runners.
At the three mile 
marker, the top 
three runners were 
four seconds apart, 
but by the finish 
line, this gap had 
widened to almost 
30 seconds. Senior 
Kenn Oldham men
tioned that the runners were not 
able to run as conservatively as 
in the first meet due to their exners. He said he felt that this was 
one of the reasons that the run
ners decided to leave their groups.
The runners for the mens team 
started out strong, holding seven 
of the top 10 positions at the twomile mark. The top-scoring run
ners were seniors Oldham and
sophomore Matt Dennerline. 
Taking sixth and seventh to fin
ish the CMU scoring were senior 
Eric Egenolf with a time of 26:31 
and junior Zachary Negin with a 
time of 26:33.
The goaL today was for the 
girls in the back to get closer to
gap between the top three run
ners and the rest of the team was 
narrowed considerably. Coach 
Donatelli said that the womens 
teams training appears to have 
been very successful so far, and 
he expects to narrow the gap even 
more as the season progresses.
The womens 
team took first, 
second, and 
third place in 
this meet. 
Sophomore 
Brooke Cutler 
led the team by 
coming in first 
with a time .of 
18:51. She was 
followed by se
nior Andrea 
Byrnes with a 
time of 19:09 
and sophomore 
Kelly Chin with 
a time of 19:19.
CMUs cross country squads have been literally unbeatable at home, not losing a dual meet on 
Flagstaff Hill in 25 years. The teams hope to continue the trend in the UAA meet next month.
Bryan Meyer, placing first and the girls in front, said womens First-year Katy Aerui was the 
second with times of 25:50 and team coach Dario Donatelli. The next Carnegie Mellon runner,

Sonni Avattal in 12th place with 
a time of 20:40, just ahead of 
sophomore Erica Wessel. Over
all, the times were considerably 
lower than at the meet just two 
weeks ago. Coach Donatelli at
tributed this to better running 
conditions as well as the strong 
competition ,the team was pitted 
against. In addition, he said that 
the womens team had practiced 
a new strategy for taking the 
downhill portions of the course 
which helped their speed 
even more.
Both the mens and womens 
team are looking towards the fu

conference meet on October 30. 
This is the conference champion
ship meet and will be hosted here 
at Carnegie Mellon on Flagstaff 
Hill. The meet will start at 11 am 
and feature all UAA teams, so it 
will undoubtedly feature some 
intense competition as the teams 
compete for the right to go to the 
national championships. The 
teams next meet is the Allegh

The CMU football squad took to the 
road last Saturday for their first contest 
away from the home crowd at Gesling 
Stadium. Along the way, they put their 
undefeated record on the line against 
Bethany College.
In Bethany, the Tartans faced by far 
their toughest opponent so far this sea
son. In contrast to the overmatched 
Denison and Case Western squads that 
CMU rolled over in their first games, 
Bethany featured a balanced attack 
that was sure to prove much more of 
a challenge.
This was true from the very start as 
the Tartans were forced to start their 
first possession from the four-yard line 
following an excellent Bethany punt. 
After senior running back Mike 
Monsilovich was stopped just short of 
the first down marker, the Tartans got 
off a rushed punt that let Bethany start 
at the CMU 48-yard line.
From there, it took Bethany just three 
plays to score the games first touch
down on a six-yard run. The score was 
set up by a 37-yard run that showed the 
Tartans that they would be in for a 
tough game.
Finding themselves trailing for the 
first time this season, the Tartans were 
unable to generate much offense against 
the Bethany defense. The passing game 
experienced its usual share of problems,
while running backs Monsilovich and 
senior Mike Campie found their run
ning lanes blocked on every play. CMUs 
best chance of the quarter was lost when 
Monsilovich was dropped for a loss of 
three on fourth-and-one from the 
Bethany 26-yard line.
The second quarter started off with 
Bethany driving again behind a strong 
running game. Once they reached the
CMU 25-yard line, however, Bethany 
switched to the passing game. After three 
straight incomplete passes, the Tartans 
took over on downs.
Looking to even up the score, the Tar
tans marched down field with a bal
anced drive that featured eight running 
plays and six passing plays. The Tar
tans came up just short of the end zone, 
however, as senior quarterback Russ
senior Mike Campie (32) and the rest of the CMU offense.
Clays pass to Campie fell incomplete on 
fourth-and-two from the Bethany threeyard line.
After a Bethany punt, CMU put on a 
perfect display of clock management, 
going 54 yards in 2:15 to score their first 
touchdown with 14 seconds left in the 
first half. Monsilovich got the score on a 
two-yard run, but senior kicker Pat 
OMalleys extra point try failed, leaving 
the Tartans down 7-6 at 
the half.
That deficit would 
prove to be short-lived: 
48 seconds to be exact. 
Taking the second-half 
kickoff at the 31-yard 
line, the Tartans took 
just two plays to strike 
again. After Monsilovich 
rushed for no gain, Clay 
connected with junior 
quarterback Mike 
McLaughlin for a 
69-yard touchdown. 
OMalleys kick missed 
again, but Bethany was 
penalized for roughing 
the kicker. Monsilovich 
ran in for a two-point 
conversion and the Tar
tans led 14-7.
Possession alternated 
uneventfully for the rest 
of the quarter. CMU was 
unable to take advantage 
of a Bethany turnover
and the score didnt change until early 
in the fourth quarter, when a Bethany 
field goal narrowed the Tartans lead to 
four at 14-10.
CMU answered with a field goal by 
OMalley seven minutes later, but had 
to sweat out the final few minutes as 
Bethany got several chances to tie the 
score with a touchdown. Starting on 
first down from inside the CMU 10-yard 
line, Bethany had four straight passes 
fall incomplete in the end zone to turn 
the ball over on downs. With the oppor
tunity to run out the clock, however, 
CMU gave Bethany another shot. Clay 
fumbled the ball and Bethany recovered 
with plenty of time to tie the game. After 
four more incomplete passes the Tar
tans took over once again and success
fully ran out the clock to earn the 17-10 
win.
Despite being out-rushed for the first 
time this season, the Tartans held the 
edge in total yardage thanks to the emer
gence of the passing game. Clay finished 
with 134 yards on seven completions, 
mostly thanks to the long touchdown 
play. Clay also added 52 rushing yards 
to go along with Monsilovichs 42 and 
Campies 97. For the game, the Tartans 
outgained Bethany by only 41 yards in 
the closest contest this season.
This Saturday, the team will be back 
at home playing host to Alfred Univer
sity. The following week will be Home- j 
coming Weekend, when the team will j 
host Dickinson College.

Students attended worskshops, performances, and lectures at this years 
Wats:On? Festival Across the Arts, a tradition that began four years ago.
Festival continues
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Diversions Editor
Last week, CFA students abandoned 
their studios and practice rooms in or
der to take part in the Wats:On? Fes
tival Across the Arts, a tradition that 
began four years ago to honor architect 
Jill Watson (87) who died in the 1996 
TWA plane crash. The festival reflected 
Watsons transdisciplinary philosophy 
on art by bringing the five schools within 
CFA together for three days of lectures, 
performances, exhibits, and workshops 
that were conducted by both guests 
and members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
[The Wats:On? Festival] was from 
the beginning and continues to be an 
extremely valuable time in the col
lege, said Martin Prekop, dean of the 
College of Fine Arts. Our intention is 
to excite you, to stimulate you, to bring 
out the best in you as artists  to 
recognize you. Jim and Janice Watson 
[Jills parents] have been with us 
through this whole journey, he said.
From the opening ceremonies, the 
events synthesized various disciplines 
both within and outside of CFA! While 
in the past Wats:On? has been limited 
to students in CFA, this year, the en
tire campus was invited to become in
volved in the activities.
The festival has continued to 
broaden its scope and range of pro
grams to extend outside of campus, 
reaching out and attracting a Pitts
burgh audience as well, said Meg 
Siegel, PR director for CFA. When 
the festival first began, it was just a 
College of Fine Arts event  now, the 
programs are open to the entire campus 
and the greater Pittsburgh community. 
Student workshops, once reserved for 
just CFA students, are now open to all 
students. This year, for example, engi
neering students attended industrial 
designer Craig Vetters workshop.
Vetter, a motorcycle designer fa
mous for his cutting-edge designs, was 
just one of the festivals featured art
ists. Other guests included Agnes 
Denes, an environmental and concep
tual artist who combines art, philoso
phy, and science, and Thomas 
Spiegelhalter, a sculptor, architect, 
and communications designer.
Workshops went on during the day 
on Wednesday and Thursday, while 
lectures and performances took place 
at night. Having such a wide range of 
events allowed students to form a 
schedule to fit their interests.
The Wats:On? Festival aspires to 
bring to the CMU campus a diverse 
assortment of transdisciplinary art, 
said Elaine King, professor of history 
of art and theory, who spoke at the 
festivals commencement last Tues
day night in McConomy Auditorium. 
We seek to find individuals and 
groups that are committed to expand
ing their field and who purposely cross 
many areas of the arts, humanities, 
and sciences, she said.
tradition
The opening night provided a wellrounded preview of what was to come 
in the following few days. Dance AI-' 
loy, a local dance troupe interested 
in using dance as a means of art as 
well as education, presented their 
original piece Translocations: What 
If? which focused on themes of life 
and death by utilizing a pre-made 
video with a stage performance.
The evening also included a presen
tation by guest artist Magdelena 
Jetelova, who received the first Jill 
Watson Award for Transdisciplinary 
Achievement Across the Arts at last 
years Wats:On? Festival. Jetelova, 
who is originally from Czechoslova
kia, shared slides of a series of her 
works entitled Translocations. Her 
work focuses on the concepts of time 
and space, while blurring the line that 
separates architecture from art. 
Jetelova builta Translocation, which, 
in addition to her traditional themes, 
is meant to serve as a memorial for Jill 
Watson, who admired Jetelovas work.
The installation is an undergroundrectangular structure. If one were 
to go inside its interior space, your 
sense of balance would be off because 
of the angular slant of the floor, said 
King. Looking down into the piece 
gives one the sensation of falling, 
and the diagonal line is heightened 
by the fact that one side of the space 
contains a blue light, while the other 
side does not.

Students jazz up
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Following their successful 
performance on short notice at last 
years Wats:On? Festival, the CMU 
Jazz Ensemble took the stage as 
the evenings entertainment dur
ing a reception held in Rangos Hall 
following the second day of events. 
The band mixed Big Band stan
dards with small group pieces as 
well as an original composition by 
senior pianist Adam Waite, aim
ing for what conductor Gary 
Fienberg described as a hodge
podge. A number of soloists shared 
the spotlight throughout the 
evening, as the Jazz Ensemble en
tertained both the jazz fans in at
tendance and those who just 
stopped in to grab some free food.
The concert was less structured 
than a typical Jazz Ensemble 
performance. Rather than ar
ranging rows of seats for the au
dience to simply sit and listen, 
tables were set up throughout 
Rangos. The event was also ca
tered, so people could wander 
around, converse, and eatmysterious-lookingfood. The bands role 
was to entertain the audience and 
provide a pleasant atmosphere 
for the reception instead of put
ting on a formal show. This 
showed in the bands performance 
and song selection, which high
lighted a number of strong indi
vidual performances and featured 
some tunes recognizable even by 
those with a very limited knowl
edge of jazz (me).
The group consisted of various 
saxophones, trombones, trum
pets, and a rhythm section made 
up of piano, bass, and drums. 
They opened with an upbeat num
ber with a quick rhythmic pulse 
and a few solo turns. Next up was 
a laid-back, Latin-inflected tune 
with a long, fluid solo from Waite. 
Rangos proved throughout the 
night to be conducive to the 
ensembles sound, as the music 
took on a nice dynamic quality.
After these songs, the band 
played a few tunes in smaller 
groups, with an individual player 
or two joining the rhythm sec
tion. Fienberg said that one of 
the goals of the concert was to 
showcase some of the individual 
talent among the members of the 
ensemble, and the small group 
pieces were a fine way to do so.
The songs, although not quite 
as compelling as those played by 
the full band, allowed for solo 
turns by trumpeter Chris 
Colohan, Waite, bassist Matt 
Aronoff, drummer Andy Artz, and 
Fienberg himself on trumpet. In 
addition, tenor saxophonist Eric 
Spaulding was featured on several 
group pieces, and was by far the
evening
busiest soloist of the evening. 
Eventually, they returned to 
the full band for one of their 
strongest numbers, a toe-tapping composition which ranked 
among the most engaging of the 
evening and included solos 
from Spaulding, trumpeter Matt 
Taylor, and alto saxophonist 
Dana Howell
Like any good performers, the 
CMU Jazz Ensemble saved a 
few of their best performances 
for last. Spaulding and Colohan 
led a small group in the most 
rock n roll-sounding song of the 
night, an enjoyable piece which 
pop fans may have recognized 
as the basis for US3s novelty 
hit Cantaloop. For the final 
song of the night, the ensemble 
played Fast-Forward, an up
tempo, crowd-pleasing jazz 
tune with some strong drum 
and bass work.
Throughout their perfor
mance, the CMU Jazz Ensemble 
was able to both grab the inter
est of those people passing 
through and hold the interest of 
those there for the duration. 
The band proved adept at recre
ating whatever sound they 
chose, whether it was classical, 
Big Band swing, or do wn-tempo 
mood music, a variety keeping 
in spirit with the eclectic nature 
of the Wats:On? Festival itself.

Chicken opera hits high note
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
To all of you old-school clothes 
launderers out there, heres some 
news for you: Clothespins arent 
just for hanging out your leop
ard-print bikini briefs any longer. 
As Susan Vitucci showed the au
dience of the Wats:On? Festivals 
showing of La Pulcina Piccola 
Thursday night, clothespins can 
convey the sincerest of emotions, 
even when they pertain to 
such minutia as the trials and 
tribulations of the love life of 
Chicken Little.
According to Vituccis interpre
tation, the fact that the sky was 
falling on Chicken Little played a 
minor role in the grand scope of 
Littles life. With characters con
structed from clothespins and 
Styrofoam, Vitucci portrayed 
Chicken Littles many dances 
with love, to the tune of an Ital
ian opera.
The show opened with rows of 
undecorated clothespins danc
ing to the overture of La Pulcina 
Piccola, some set upon a spiraling circle, emulating the swirling 
dance numbers common to many 
Broadway shows. This display of 
mock seriousness had the audi
ence chuckling from the very be
ginning and continued to provoke 
belly-aching laughter throughout
the duration of the performance.
First, the audience was intro
duced to Chicken Littles friends, 
Loosey Goosey, Lucky Ducky, 
Turkey Lurkey, and her beau, 
the Big Red Hen, who were fool
ish enough to allow 
themselves to be 
deterred by Mr.
Red Fox on their 
way to inform the 
king of the current 
status of the sky.
To Chicken Littles 
horror, they are 
turned into jellied 
chicken salad, and 
that was the end of 
Chicken Littles 
companionship.
But not for long.
Little, who had earlier proclaimed 
herself a young 
chick and ready for 
love, wouldnt let 
a jellied chicken 
salad keep her from 
finding her destiny 
and her one true 
love. During her 
travels, she finds 
work as an actress 
(with a starring 
role as Richard III), 
gets picked up by 
pirates (whereby 
she becomes the
Chicken of the Sea), and finds 
herself in a boxing match, where 
she meets her second-to-last 
doomed lover, Cock Robin.
Throughout all her journeys, she

Know what Mushallpa means? 
How about understanding an Andean 
man playing his wind instrument in 
the open wind of the Andes Mountains? 
These are the images of the Portrait of 
the Andes, the current exhibition in 
the UC Art Gallery. The rich pencil, 
vibrant colors, and textured papers of 
Peruvian artist Victor Beltran adorn 
the walls, conveying rich images of life 
in another world. This calm wooden 
room holds Victor Beltrans personal 
collection, which reaches back to his 
childhood years in Peru. As a native of 
Peru, Beltrans memories of life in the 
Andes arise vividly and powerfully 
from the walls: A childs forlorn face 
lost in thought. Three young friends 
passing for a moment in time. An aged 
but spirited woman patiently sorting 
colored scraps of fabric. An elderly man 
peering out into the lonesome immense 
fields of desert sands from the tiny cir
cle of shade under his hat. Such por
trayals harken back to a simpler life of 
silent moments and freedom of expres
sion through song and talk.
Seemingly random words and phras
es peer through Beltrans paintings: 
some random backgrounds, other with
hidden meanings. Terse descriptions 
show themselves alongside people, 
alluding to the persons mysterious 
nature. As a girl, less than 12 years old, 
looks into a point in space behind the
line of watercolors to the inanimate but base of the city, which drops off into &
lively and ornate church masses, store
fronts, and residential buildings. The

itself clear. A little Peruvian village,

Macchu Picchu, 12,000 feet high in the 
Andes, reminds many of the popular 
grade-school history book picture of a 
lonely, ancient city near the top of the 
world. A soft bed of clouds encircles the
luscious green unknown. The ancient 
and simple scene atop the mountain is 
shaded yellow in Beltrans interpreta

to contemplate.
Beltran comes to Carnegie Mellon 
through the University of Pittsburgh Center 
for Latin American Studies Board of Direc
tors. Generously providing his personal col
lection for display here at Carnegie Mellon, 
his gallery continues to thrill audiences as it 
travels through Western Pennsylvanian col
leges. Beltran has held numerous exhibi
tions in the Pittsburgh area, including 
shows at the La Roche College Cantellops 
Art Gallery and in the Monroeville Library 
System, and has a permanent display at the 
prestigious Watercolor Gallery. Portraits of 
the Andes continues at the Millsteih 
Library in Greensburg while a new Sail

Look on any bookshelf in the 
local bookstore and there will 
be an entire section with books 
on How to Succeed, but there 
definitely is not a section 
labeled Failure. Today, the 
emphasis on succeeding seems 
high-pressure whether it be on 
a calculus test or in a career 
path. Scott Sandage, an assis
tant professor of history, 
noticed this cultural standard 
too when he decided to write a 
book entitled Forgotten Men: 
Failure in American Culture.
Born in Iowa, Professor 
Sandage grew up in both Iowa 
and Washington, D.C. After 
attending public school in Iowa, 
he studied to be a writer at the 
University of Iowa. After college, 
where he took no history courses, 
Sandage lived in Germany, 
working in international trade. 
He then returned and worked as 
a lobbyist, following the footsteps 
of his mother, who was a politi
cal activist. Sandage then 
received his PhD. in 1995 from 
Rutgers University. After teach
ing at Columbia University, he 
came to Carnegie Mellon, where 
he has now been for four years as 
a faculty member.
The Tartan recently sat down 
with Professor Sandage to dis
cuss his book and ideas on fail
ure in our culture.
2lgo01 po1uMMM
The Tartan: What is your 
book about?
Scott Sandage: The book is 
about losers. Its a book about 
the idea of failure in American 
culture and how Americans 
came to be a nation of people 
who beat themselves up and 
are constantly accepting our 
own progress and the progress 
of people around us. Keeping 
up with the Joneses and won
dering if we are falling behind.
TT\ What inspired you to 
write the book?
SS: I come from a long line of 
losers myself. Really, I was 
inspired to write while I was in 
grad school because there are a 
lot of books about success and 
self-made manhood such as 
people like Andrew Carnegie 
and how they rose from rags to 
riches and pulled themselves 
up by their bootstraps. Grow
ing up all around me, and even 
today, I see people who work 
really hard and, for one reason 
or another, they dont achieve 
success. So, I wondered what it 
would be like in a country that 
is so obsessed with the idea 
that if you work hard, you will 
become successful. Whats it 
like to fail, in a country like 
that, and how have the 
meanings of failure changed 
over time?
TT: Is there something that 
youve learned that surprised 
you writing this book?
SS: Yeah, a lot of things. The 
first is that it wasnt always 
the case that people called 
themselves failures or referred 
to other people as failures. In 
the 1700s, that was not the 
way people thought about 
themselves. It was really in the 
1800s with the advent of the 
Industrial Revolution and the 
growth of the society in which 
more and more people are 
working for wages and have 
jobs and begin to measure 
themselves along career 
tracks, that it became possible 
to say, I am a failure. Which 
is not to say that people didnt 
lose money in the 1700s or the 
1600s or the 1500s but they 
didnt express that experience 
with a sense of I feel like a 
failure, or My brother is such 
a failure. So, I wanted to know 
why weve changed our lan
guage and started to talk 
about it in that way.
Two interesting things that I 
discovered are that the pair of 
failure and success and the 
way we talk about it now is in 
some ways a replacement for 
another pair of words that we 
used to use in this country and 
thats slave and citizen. Before 
the Civil War, the two kinds of 
things you could be were either 
a slave or a citizen. After the 
Civil War happened and slav
ery was abolished, we began to 
talk much more in terms of
putting people into boxes  
theyre either a success or 
theyre a failure. I find even at 
my classes here at CMU, when 
students use the language of 
success they mix it up with the 
language of freedom and, vice 
versa, when they use the 
language of freedom, they 
mix it up with the language 
of success.
So, if I say in class, What 
does it mean to you to be free? 
students will say, lb be free is 
to have the opportunity to bet
ter myself and achieve my 
goals and set dreams for 
myself and go about building 
the kind of life that I want. 
Nobody ever says to be free 
means exercising my rights 
under the Bill of Rights and 
enjoying the protection that I 
receive under the 13th, 14th, 
and 15th Amendments of the 
Constitution. After the Civil 
War, freedom becomes much 
less a legal status and much 
more a cultural status, so that 
to be free is to be successful 
and to be successful is to 
be free.
If you fail, thats a really big 
problem, and thats the reason 
that people get so upset about 
even minor failures. Thats one 
thing that I was surprised to 
discover  the nexus of slav
ery, citizenship, failure, and 
success. The second is that the 
fundamental meaning of failure has changed from the early 
1800s, when if you said u\ 
failed, or Im a failure, whai 
you meant was you were ii 
business and you lost a lot of 
money. Now when we say I 
failed, or I feel like a failure,' 
we tend to mean something 
else. We tend to mean Im no} 
living up to my potential, Iri 
not doing everything I coulij 
do, Im living a pretty aimlesj 
life, I dont have any goald 
Im not working toward any
thing. Its very different that 
going bankrupt.
So the change that I see ifc 
that in the early 1800s failure 
was associated with reaching 
too far. You owned a business, 
you extended your credit toj) 
far, hard times came along, 
and you lost your business. Yoti 
tried to do too much and yoji 
were punished for that. Now 
when we talk about failure, we 
talk about it in the sense of 
under-reaching. Not setting 
your goals high enough, and so 
your guidance counselor says 
to you, Youre not working up 
to your potential, or your pro
fessor writes on your essa^, 
This is smart, but I know you 
can do better. Well, if its 
smart, then its smart, right? 
How can you be failing if you 
are doing well? In many ways, 
Americans today consider that 
theyre failing, even though 
theyre doing pretty well.

The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster - A Paradigm for 
Changing Workplace/Career Ethics
Roger Boisjoly, Ethics Lecturer And Forensic Engineer
This talk will focus on the Challenger pre-launch decision process using a 
timeline of major technical problems, discoveries on the booster joints, as 
well as the management behavior at Morton Thiokol and NASA prior and 
subsequent to launch. As a principal engineer at Morton Thiokol and 
technical troubleshooter on the space shuttle solid rocket boosters, Boisjoly 
participated in the pre-launch teleconference with NASA managers, and 
recommended and defended the original no-launch decision. His 
testimony was vital to exposing the truth about the decision to launch and 
the organizational misbehavior at Morton Thiokol and NASA.

By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Special Projects Manager
So, you think you have what it takes to 
found a successful start-up? How about not 
paying yourself for months on end while 
working 16-hour days? Or rolling the dice 
with the odds stacked against you? What is 
that engineering or science degree going to do 
.for you while navigating the world of general 
ledgers, financial ratios, and IPOs, anyway? 
Todays world of start-up software companies 
is not for the faint of heart, and in the end, its 
not the bits and algorithms that define suc
cess  its the people.
So what does it take? Everyone at Carnegie 
Mellon knows the story of Lycos  the Internet-search-engine-turned-network-of-Websites was founded in June 1995 utilizing tech
nology developed at CMU. It went public just 
10 months later (the fastest IPO in history) 
and has been growing ever since.
While the early days of Lycos seem far 
removed from todays Carnegie Mellon stu
dent, the CMU-Lycos connection is still 
strong. Robert Frasca, vice president and gen
eral manager ofLycos.com, is a graduate from 
GSIA, and a pioneer in the field of Internet 
commerce. His diverse background includes a 
bachelors degree in mechanical engineering 
from Rochester Institute of Technology and 
six years as a flight officer in the U.S. 
Navy. Today he may best be classified as an 
Internet entrepreneur.
The exciting thing about entrepreneurs is 
using all your skills, he said. If youre an 
engineer, you only need to use one set, but if 
you start a company of your own, you use 
them all.
Frasca is also the founder and former chair
man and chief executive officer of GALT Tech
nologies, one of the first companies focused 
solely on Internet commerce, which is known 
for its NETworth software. Having been 
through all the ups and downs of start-ups, he 
sold GALT Technologies to Intuit in 1996.
I get mad when people say its luck, he 
said. You must have luck but most impor
tantly you must be sawy and aggressive.... 
Theres no real eureka moment, its pure grit.
The first time we tried a start-up was when 
I was still an MBA student at CMU. We came 
up with a idea, did tons of research, raised 
capital. I went five months without paying 
myself, and we came close to flaming out a 
number of times. You cant take no as an 
answer. If you quit, forget it.
Another CMU success story comes from 
electrical and computer engineering gradu
ates Eric Boduch and Todd Olson, who found
ed Cerebellum Software in 1996. The compa
ny, which designs an application development 
platform that features a single graphical 
interface for accessing, integrating, and 
updating information from multiple data 
sources, has grown phenomenally over 
the past three years and today boasts over 
50 employees.
Past success aside, however, another key to 
start-up success is an untamed desire for 
growth. Were not doing it to be number two 
or three, he said. We are a market leader. 
Whether its a two-person start-up or a 
mature Internet company, veterans of the 
trade will agree that success is dependent on 
the people.
An ideal person for this company is one 
that thinks quickly and intelligently, said 
Olson. More importantly, though, we want 
someone who cares  were building some
thing here and we want our employees to take 
some pride in that.
You can have the best idea in the world and 
it doesnt work if you dont have the people, 
said Frasca. Most of the companies without 
the right mix of people blow up. The old adage 
is that its one part idea and 10 parts people 
is true.
So where does Carnegie Mellon come into 
play? CMU is a bastion of geekery, said 
Frasca. Its the geeks that are going to inher
it the earth. Im a geek. Im proud of it!
You have to be a computer person in that 
you have to understand the customer, you 
need to translate the needs of the customer 
into a product. My only criticism to engineer
ing is that they sometimes get enamored with 
technology and dont concentrate on the prod
uct that the technology represents. At the end 
of the day youre selling things.
CMU -provides an excellent environment 
for teaching students to work hard, said
Olson. There is great preparation for real 
world in that the focus is not on memorized 
material, its thinking out of the box. That is 
incredible for the business world.
Education is all about having a toolbox; 
you want a diverse set of tools, said Frasca. 
You may sit back in an engineering class 
wondering what youre ever going to need 
with a differential equation. Its not about 
doing calculations; its about having the tool 
and the ability to think logically. An engineer
ing degree gives you an analytical toolkit. An 
MBA gives you the tools for management and 
business and problem solving.
Start-up companies play a critical role, even 
in todays business world of multi-billion dol
lar mergers. Speed is life, said Frasca. The 
faster things change, the better. In a start-up, 
you dont have bureaucracy; its all about fast 
innovation. Innovate or get out of the way. 
So follow the advice of a few successful 
CMU grads - take the plunge and define your 
career on your own terms. Dont ever let any
one tell you that you won't be successful, said 
Olson. People sell themselves short, and its 
disappointing. Dont just take that job from 
Netscape or IBM or whatever just because its 
the first one that came along - you may regret 
it five years from now sitting in a cubicle... Do 
it now when youre still young.
Its a zero-risk game; theres more money 
now than ever, said Frasca. Whats the 
worst that can happen? It flames? Then start 
something else; theres no risk!
Start-up job fair offers new opportunities
By JANU BHAGWATI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The start-up job fair that took place 
this Friday in Rangos Hall involved 38 
major companies from the United 
States. The idea was to introduce the 
students to prospective employers and 
in turn to introduce the employers to 
prospective employees. The majority of 
the companies were searching for full
time workers in their junior or senior 
years of college. As expected, the major 
which was the most in demand was 
computer science. However, business 
and engineering were close seconds.
Some of the companies that were 
present were Data Path Systems, 
Digital Impact, SneakerLabs Inc, Net 
Health Systems, and Enterprize. 
There were companies from different 
industries present. However, some 
big companies that were noticeably 
absent included those on Wall Street, 
which will be well-represented at the 
Business Opportunities Conference 
and the Technical Opportunities Con
ference. All the companies brought 
brochures describing their clients and 
the natures of their enterprises. As
helpful as these brochures undoubt
edly were, one student commented 
that he wanted more information on 
how he would be treated as a prospec
tive employee. The student wanted to 
know what his salary, his work sched
ule, and his benefits would be as 
an employee.
The students who came to the job fair 
were of varied backgrounds. The firstyear and sophomore classes were wellrepresented by the members of the 
classes who turned out for the fair. Most 
students said that their goal was not to 
obtain employment any time in the 
near future, but to make contacts to 
increase the likelihood of obtaining a 
job sometime in the next couple of 
years.
The seniors and juniors all came 
dressed in suits and ties and equipped 
with resumes and files to assert their 
worthiness as future employees. How
ever, this was just the commencement 
of the whole process of getting a job, and 
few students expected to get job inter
views immediately. Even so, many peo
ple were asked for interviews and invit
ed to the next stage of the 
job process.Students discuss job opportunities with participants at last Fridays start-up job fair.

Less Stress?
by Emily Landes
Heres something you might not know 
about me. I really dont like to wear shoes, 
or socks for that matter. I dont know why 
my feet need to feel liberated, they just do. 
This is the reason that I have often been 
heard to remark that, were it not for certain 
weather and societal constraints, I would go 
barefoot at all times.
The first time I uttered these words was 
during one of the beautiful end-of-summer 
days at the start of my freshman year. But 
shortly thereafter I noticed that at Carnegie 
Mellon there was no social reason to wear 
shoes. People were walking around barefoot 
all over the place. They didnt care if their 
feet got dirty; hell, those were probably two 
of their cleaner body parts. Following this 
example I was happily barefoot for a good 
portion of the beginning to the semester.
Unfortunately, I do not feel that I could do 
the same today. Horribly, frustratingly, but 
hopefully not irrevocably, fashion has 
arrived in full effect for the women at 
Carnegie Mellon University.
To some degree this is good. I am not 
about to say that this campus was without 
those who needed severe fashion assistance. 
And of course, there are some people who 
have always looked like they stepped out of 
the pages of Vogue. The people in these two 
extremes have probably not changed all 
that much. But for the most part, as far as I 
could see, female students used to fit into
the comfortably dressed, but not slovenly 
category. And they were happy.
Have you ever seen the face of a girl who 
has been wearing 5-inch platform sandals 
all day? That is not happy.
Yet that is what many women on campus 
have been wearing. These heels of death are 
usually accompanied by some sort of skirt, 
usually short. Even more usually, far too 
short. Heres an easy way to tell where your 
skirt rates: If guys keep dropping things 
accidentally right in front of you in the 
hopes that youll bend down and pick them, 
your skirt is far too short.
If its not a skirt, then it is some version of 
the dreaded capri pant. Okay, Im sorry, I 
know that they are very fashionable and all 
that, but I have a secret for all those capri 
wearers: Nobodys bottom fourth of their 
calf looks good. Not even yours. It just looks 
stupid. Stop it.
These looks are usually finished off with a 
top of some kind, be it of the halter, tube, 
or tank variety. In total, perhaps two fifths 
of the newly fashionable womans body is 
covered by cloth, and that cloth is cut in 
such a way that it gives a pretty good idea 
of what those hidden two fifths look like.
And this is what girls are wearing to 
class! In the middle of a Wednesday after
noon! Sometimes these outfits border on 
inappropriate, which is a whole different 
article. I am not about to encroach on 
peoples freedom to wear whatever they 
deem acceptable. What I am talking 
about here is a certain level of comfort 
which CMU used to offer and no longer 
does. The bar has been raised, and wear
ing pajama pants to class just isnt cut
ting it anymore.
Party clothes are an entirely different 
story. Here just the illusion of clothing is 
necessary. A bib and a belt are considered a
full ensemble. (The heels also get higher, 
but in this case at least some practicality is 
involved. You want your feet to be as far 
away from that nasty party floor as possi
ble.) My first night out at the frats my fresh
man year, I wore a Mr. Bump t-shirt, jeans, 
and sneakers. During last weeks soirees, I 
wore a silverish-gray, partially transparent, 
spandex skirt, platform sandals, and a lowcut, fitted black shirt. I may have looked 
cuter more recently, but at least before I 
could enjoy myself without wondering what 
part of my body was bouncing out of my 
clothes at any given time.
But I think that what is most annoying is 
that its not as though guys have gone 
through the same transformation for us. 
While I will admit to seeing more khakis 
and button-down shirts recently, for the 
most part jeans and a t-shirt are still the 
norm. Basically they are getting a free peep 
show, while we have no idea whats going on 
underneath those giant Jencos.
So, whats the deal? Isnt there a 3:1 
guy to girl ratio at this school? Shouldnt 
they be the ones getting all dressed up to 
get our attention? It hardly seems fair. 
We hold all the cards, girls. What are we 
doing to ourselves? So, heres my proposi
tion, ladies  lets stop this silly catwalking. You know that you arent com
fortable in those clothes. You can feel 
those fleece warm-up pants calling from 
the back of your drawer. Please, think of 
your poor sisters at UPenn and Cornell. 
Its too late for them to turn back, but we 
still have a chance. Lets not waste it on 
tube tops.
Emily Landess father called her a cur
mudgeon after reading her last two 
columns. She hopes that this column has 
only helped to cement that image.

Hot Indian food is served up daily to CMU community members out of the back of Srees minivan.
By JANU BHAGWATI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Although Carnegie Mellon is 
not a university known for its 
culinary delights, there is no 
dearth of variety in the non-UC 
restaurants. The campus boasts 
two Chinese eateries and 
numerous small restaurants in 
the University Center. There are 
also two mini-restaurants which 
serve Indian food  Srees and 
Taste of India. To those who are 
not yet intimately acquainted 
with the campus, their location 
and existence may seem 
obscure, but even though their 
location is inconspicuous, be 
assured, they are out there.
Taste of India is a small oper
ation which is located on the 
first floor of Building D. For stu
dents who have never ventured 
to the AV lab, the preceding 
description of the location may
not be of much use. Building D 
is a gray structure located 
behind Wean Hall, but one has 
to go the first floor of Wean to 
access this elusive building D. 
Taste of India offers a selection 
of non-vegetarian and vegetari
an North Indian food. The usual 
order, which is not unlike a plat
ter, consists of rice, bread, and 
three portions of different veg
etable entrees or chicken curry 
and a vegetable entree. The food 
is not astounding in its taste but 
it is not at all bad-tasting. The 
portions are good and it is a good 
break from the monotony of the 
food offered in the UC. The own
ers try to create some variety in 
the food they serve and there
fore the entrees vary from day to 
day. Unfortunately, at the end of 
the day, Taste of India may not 
be some peoples choice as a 
daily lunch, but it affords a good 
break, and has a completely dif
ferent flavor from other on-campus eateries.
Srees is located behind Scaife 
Hall in a small trailer - a very 
makeshift restaurant  but nev
ertheless it is effective for the 
business. It is a longer trek than 
Taste of India, but it is also 
serves marginally better food. 
Although the diversity in the 
food selection is about the same 
in both eateries, the quality of 
the entrees and especially the 
bread is better at Srees. The 
food offered is once again North 
Indian and the entrees are both 
non-vegetarian and vegetarian. 
The food is prepared with a little 
more authenticity, and the fla
vors are a little more distinct. 
However, one must keep in mind 
that this analysis is relative - 
by no means is Srees a gourmet 
Indian eatery. It is once again a 
different but slightly better 
taste, but it is also a longer jour
ney than Taste of India.
It should be noted also that 
neither of these eateries accepts 
Dine Xpress, and while Taste of 
India accepts campus, Srees 
only accepts cash. Although the 
distance and the difficulty in the 
form of payment may result in 
very infrequent visits to the 
respective eateries, one can safe
ly say that after eating all the 
other food on campus it will be a 
very welcome change.

The Geek Beat
by Kevin Babbitt
' Every once in a while, somene comes up with a bad idea 
that just needs to be allowed 
to die.
' Such is the case with the pro
posed Internet tax. A panel of 
technology leaders and politi
cians, appointed by Congress, 
is currently investigating this 
possibility. I could go on for 
some time about the philosoph
ical opposition to such a tax, 
liut the fact is, it doesnt mat
ter. The New York Times 
reported last Wednesday that 
neither the American people 
nor Congress itself is thrilled 
with the idea. The Times also 
mentioned a Gallup poll show
ing that 73 percent of Internet 
users were against such a tax.
And with good reason. The 
obvious parallel here is with 
the current policy on taxing 
sales across state boundaries 
 such a tax is only levied if 
the company has a significant 
presence in the customers 
home state. The very nature of 
electronic commerce makes it 
difficult to track such informa
tion when a Net-based transac
tion takes place. Often, large 
companies have Web servers 
located in several places 
around the country in order to 
spread out the load. So the 
question is, does a Web server 
count as a significant pres
ence? Im nqt convinced that 
this is true, because a Web 
server is far easier to move 
from one state to another than, 
say, a full-blown sales office.
Besides, any given customers 
sales transaction may not 
always go through the same 
path  physical or network 
proximity isnt the only deter
mining factor for where in 
cyberspace the sale takes place. 
For example, a customer in 
Pittsburgh might buy a product 
via a server in Boston one day 
and via Philadelphia the next, 
depending on the load on each 
server on that particular day. 
There is almost no distinction 
between the two purchases from 
the customers perspective, 
yet one sale took place 
in their home state and 
one didnt.
Suppose the companys head
quarters is in Boston, and their 
Philadelphia office consists
solely of a room with a Linux 
box running the Apache Web 
server. While it is possible to 
track each individual sale, it 
will certainly cause some headscratching among company 
accountants and customers 
alike when one sale is taxed 
and another identical sale  
same customer, same order, dif
ferent day  is not. Even worse 
is the fact that IP addresses 
know no state boundaries, so 
tracking where the customer 
made the purchase from, and 
even if they made the purchase 
from their own computer, could 
be problematic.
And then there are overseas 
sales. Supporters of the tax 
seem to have forgotten that the 
Internet is a global network. As 
I mentioned, its quite easy to 
move a sales server from one 
place to another. If the panel 
does recommend a tax and 
Congress decides to support it, 
companies can just redirect 
their online transactions to 
hosts outside the United 
States. The Internet has 
evolved to the point where cus
tomers wont notice much of a 
difference performance-wise, 
and I sincerely doubt that our 
neighbor nations will be willing 
to be taxed by the U.S.
Proponents of the Internet tax 
argue that states are already 
losing billions of dollars in rev
enue because of out-of-state 
sales, and they will lose even 
more as electronic commerce 
moves more and more transac
tions into cyberspace. These 
states need to consider other, 
more tangible sources of income. 
I can tell you from experience 
that Massachusetts taxes its 
residents on just about every
thing. Except tea. They learned 
not to do that when the British 
tried it in the 1700s. But the 
point is, levying a tax on Inter
net sales will also stifle the 
growth of the hot new e-com
merce industry, and slowing for
ward progress is, in general, a 
bad thing to do.
So as I said, sometimes you 
just need to let a bad idea die. 
Congress doesnt want it, citi
zens of the Net dont want it, 
and it just doesnt make 
sense. And besides, if it pass
es, Amazon.com employees 
might protest by throwing 
books off boats into Seattles 
Elliott Bay.

By RACHEL KINGERY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Most of my life, I did what I 
wanted to do.... I did a lot. Ask 
Craig Vetter what kind of guy he 
is, and hell tell you hes a doer. 
However, he will also tell you 
now that his family comes first, 
before his motorcycles, before 
his hot tubs, hovercrafts, glid
ers, and wheelchairs.
Industrial designer and entre
preneur Vetter gave the 15th
instead of wood. I bought a hot 
tub, and I liked it. So I bought 
the company, he said.
The lecture began with a display 
of magazine clippings, pictures of 
the hovercrafts he built while still 
in high school, baby pictures, long 
hair and ripped jeans pictures, 
long hair and no jeans pictures  
sharing much more than just his 
inventions and designs. He told 
his story starting at the beginning, 
before he even had his first tricy
cle (which, incidentally, he got at
Ko Nakatsu/Tartan Photo Staff 
Craig Vetter discussed his lifes work last Thursday in McConomy.
Robert Lepper Distinguished 
Lecture in Creative Inquiry on 
Thursday, September 16 in 
McConomy Auditorium in the 
University Center. In his lec
ture, entitled From Human 
Doing to Human Being, he can
didly related where his life has 
taken him over the last 30 years 
and where he is now.
Fruits of Vetters creativity 
are on display in the Motorcycle 
Hall of Fame in Ohio, and a 
machine from his Vetter Fuel 
Economy Run race is on perma
nent display in the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington, D.C. 
His motorcycle, Hurricane, was 
displayed with 100 other motor
cycles selected for their design 
in the Guggenheim Museums 
Art and the Motorcycle exhibit 
this year. It all started with his 
creation, the fairing  the first 
windshield for motorcycles, 
which totally changed the image 
of the American motorcyclist. He 
designed the wheelchair that 
won the 1982 Boston Marathon 
and also skyrocketed the profits 
of the Cooperage Hot Tub Com
pany after he bought it and 
began manufacturing hot tubs 
out of his beloved plastics
the early age of 1). His family tree 
is full of inventors, machinists, 
and motorcycle lovers. As a small 
boy he was constantly building 
and trying to improve things. He 
remembered one day when he and 
his brother found an old wagon, 
bolted it to a wagon they already 
had, and searched the neighbor
hood for a dog to pull them 
across country.
Vetter grew up and enrolled at 
the University of Illinois after a
very brief stint in the Air Force 
(he wasnt building things like 
little airplanes and vehicles). It 
wasnt until an industrial design 
display caught his eye while in 
college that he knew what he 
should be doing.
Buckminster Fuller, an Amer
ican engineer and inventor, was 
and still is Vetters hero. Fuller 
taught that less was more and 
Vetter understood that. I drove 
a motor scooter, he said. And he 
did  he drove a custom-built 
motor scooter to his classes for 
two years.
Vetter describes himself in the 
years after college as an indus
trial warrior for America. He 
said that in the way that Bob 
Dylan and the Beatles changed 
music, I took plastics. From 
the very first handmade Plexi
glass windshield to the busi
nesses he ran and eventually 
sold, Vetter shared entertaining 
anecdotes, hardships, designers 
clay, and the many bits of advice 
that he learned throughout his 
experience with an intrigued 
audience. Vetter spoke of the 
60s and being called a hippie, 
the negative image that Life and 
Time magazines gave bikers, 
and how proud he was of being 
able to help change that.
One of his most profound life 
changes was an accident he had 
during a motorcycle race that 
almost took away his ability to 
walk. It forced him to slow down 
and give his workers a break, 
and it humbled him. Through 
his recovery, he relied on 
the support of his girlfriend, 
who would eventually become 
his wife.
Rick Wake, a first-year com
munication design major who 
attended the lecture, thought 
that Vetters ability to adapt to 
the changing markets and to his 
own environment is really 
important to a designer. I 
thought the guy was interesting.
His early life and the fact that 
he was making hovercrafts in 
high school is amazing, he said. 
Wake also said he was 
impressed with how Vetters 
fairing changed the image of 
bikers in the eye of the public.
Now Vetter lives on a ranch in 
California with his wife and two 
sons, ages 17 and 15. He has 
been retired since 1980, when 
he sold his business. Work is 
important, but family is more 
important and God is most 
important of all, he said. 
Although he is no longer run
ning a business, he hasnt 
stopped working. He is an active 
member of the community he 
lives in, and he stressed the 
importance of being a husband 
and a father. Right now he is in 
the brainstorming stages of cre
ating a new race, like his Craig 
Vetter Fuel Economy Run, but 
this time he wants to challenge 
designers to utilize the space 
0-18 feet above the ground. 
The future of motorcycles is 
up, he said. He challenges 
designers to design a machine 
that uses the air space above 
ground using motorcycle-like 
engines, and his only rule so far 
is that it has to be safe enough 
for any child to touch anywhere 
and not get hurt. The plan is for 
a race every year for five years, 
so that if a design doesnt work 
one year, it can be perfected for 
the next.
Vetter said he feels connect
ed with Lepper. Im a Robert 
Lepper kind of guy, said Vet
ter. Lepper himself, who 
died in 1991. was described 
as a Socrates of CMU; 
his debates with colleagues 
over creativity were famous 
across campus. Among his 
other work, he was commis
sioned for the mural in the 
lobby of Carnegie Mellons 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administrations Posner Hall.

"Hey Moma, I guess Watson's up sh*t creek 
without a paddle" said Dr. G. "It's more of

hair in the painting, and he's naked. "God 
damn hippies, marajauna cigarette smoking,
I hope he gets devoured by jaws over there" 
said Moma. "Put some clothes on you free 
loving, peace preaching whore!" said Dr. G. .
Dr. Guggenheim and his Moma went to the 
art museum. It was so wonderful, lalalalala. 
They were so cultured and intelligently 
critiquing. Insulting the gaurds too. One of 
their least favorite paintings was Watson and 
the Shark, depicting a man named Watson, 
a shark and other guys in a boat trying to 
rescue the unfortunate Watson.
Dr. G. and Moma were too busy ranting to 
notice Watson, and the shark getting quite 
aggravated. "That's it! I've had enough of 
you two!" said Watson. "Quit jabbering and 
start swimming!" said Moma. "I'm not going 
to eat him, I survive on a diet of plankton, 
I'm a vegetarian. If any meat were to enter 
my system I'd get deathly ill" said the shark.
"Listen up you idiots!" said Watson "I was 
bathing, naked of course and my hair is long 
because I am a sailor, but I don't have scurvy. 
There weren't any hippies when this painting 
was made so I can't be a hippy, and the shark

When Arnold Schoenbergs 
Gurrelieder first premiered in Vienna 
in 1913, the audience in attendance 
was expecting the worst from 
Schoenberg. By 1913, Schoenberghad 
been in his atonal phase for more than 
10 years. However, a few minutes into 
the performance, the audience had 
changed its mind about Gurrelieder 
and marked their appreciation of the 
work with extraordinary applause 
upon the conclusion.
Last Friday at Heinz Hall, Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) di
rector Mariss Jansonss led the PSO, 
the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh, 
and six solo singers in an awesome 
and energetic performance of 
Schoenbergs monumental work. Un
der Jansonss skillful direction, the 
concert, which marked the first of the 
1999-2000 PSO classical series, proved 
to be a resounding success, with 10 
minutes of thundering applause fol
lowing the performance.
Fridays concert marked the first 
performance of Gurrelieder in Pitts
burgh. Because of the complicated
logistics and great financial expense as
sociated with the production, only a 
handful of orchestras attempt the work 
every year. Liking to live dangerously, 
Jansons, however, has consistently tried 
to bring new and exciting works to Heinz 
Hall, and Gurrelieder is perhaps the most 
exciting new piece to come to Pittsburgh 
in the last decade. Jansons is familiar 
with the piece, as he just finished record
ing the work with the Oslo Philharmonic 
this past summer.
Schoenbergs Gurrelieder, a piece that 
lasts approximately one hour and 45 min
utes, was inspired by the poems of Dan
ish writer Jens Jacobsen. In these poems, 
Jacobsen narrates the legend of King 
Waldemar the Great and his passionate 
love affair with the beautiful lady ToveLille. Accordingto these poems, when his 
beloved Tove unexpectedly meets with 
death, Waldemar becomes furious with 
God for having taken her away and vows 
to find Tove and be united with her again.
In Schoenbergs musical adaptation of 
the poems, the parts of the main charac
ters are played by six soloists. Tenor Ben 
Heppner gave a passionate rendition of 
King Waldemars challengingpart, while 
soprano Margaret Jane Wray gave life to 
the character of Tove-Lille. Wood Dove, 
the mysterious character that informs 
Waldemar of Toves death, was played by
mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore. Other 
performers included Anthony Dean 
Griffey as Klaus the Jester, Alan Held 
as a peasant, and veteran opera 
singer Ernst Haefliger as a jovial and 
animated speaker.
As a piece that was originally scored for 
five soloists, three four-part male cho
ruses, an eight-part mixed chorus, and 
over 90 instruments  including four 
harps, fourteen clarinets divided among 
four different types, and such instru
ments as the Wagner tuba and iron 
chainsGurrelieder poses a substantial 
challenge to the conductor, who is faced 
with the task of balancing the roles of 
each section. At Fridays concert there 
were over300 performers. With this many 
musicians, Jansons faced a formidable 
task keeping all 300 people together 
throughout the evening. Jansons rose to 
the challenge, however, demonstrating a 
remarkable degree of control over the en
sembles without having to compromise 
musical sensitivity. Despite the length of 
the work, Jansons demonstrated a consis
tently high level of sensitivity to the musi
cal aspects of each section of the work.
Next week the PSO will perform Max 
Bruchs Scottish Symphony featuring Gil 
Shaham, along with Haydns Symphony 
Number 104, London, and Schumanns 
fourth symphony in D minor.

Last Wednesday at 4:30, visitors to 
the University Center were treated to 
a performance by the junior musical 
theater class Cabaret singers and 
dancers for the Wats:On? festival. The 
production was simple, but overall the 
show was very entertaining.
The cabaret began with a number 
from Closer than Ever, called Doors, 
which was perfomed by the entire com
pany. This was followed by various 
members of the company singing 10 
different musical standards, either as 
solos or duets. The performance ended 
with the entire company singing The
Rhythm of Life from Sweet Charity.
The actual production ofthe performance 
was very sparse. The performers wore 
simply all black, with only a few simple 
clothing pieces used as props. All of the 
songs were accompanied only by a single 
piano. The choreography, by Judith Conte, 
for most of the numbers, with the excep
tion of the last one, involved either very 
simple movement or none at all. All of this 
simplicity helped contribute to the profes
sional but light-hearted mood of the show.
The loud crowd that gathered really got 
into the performance, with lots of noise, 
catcalls and applause when people they 
knew were on stage. The only bad part 
about the performance was that the acous
tics in Kirr Commons were not that good,
so that although each of the numbers was 
beautifully sung, the sound echoed around 
so much it was hard to make out a lot of 
what was being sung.
However, the choice of Kirr for a perfor
mance for the Wats:On? festival was a 
good one. Even though the core crowd was 
mostly made up of drama students and 
faculty, people from all the other disci
plines on campus, who normally wouldnt 
get a chance to see the musical theater 
students perform, but were walking 
through the University Center at 4:30 on 
Wednesday, were able to get a taste and 
leave when they felt like it. And that was 
one ofthe points of the festivalto expose 
people from all over the University to the 
fine arts.

The City Theater put on a superb per
formance lastWednesdaynightofLorraine 
Hansbens A Raisin in the Sun. This 
production, co-produced with Kuntu Rep
ertory Theater, deserves much praise. The 
talent of the actors helped create a homey, 
personalized atmosphere. This was also 
helped by the intimate seating arrange
ment, where the audience was practically
causes much upheaval in their marriage. 
Meanwhile, Walter Lee is struggling to 
discover his manhood and five up to his 
position in life by trying to be a business
man although he is poor.
To further complicate things, Beneatha 
angers her religious mother by question
ing Christianity and the existence of God. 
Despite all these struggles, the whole fam
ily comes together to reach towards one 
common goal  to get out of their tiny 
apartment on Chicagos South Side.

sitting in the Younger familys living room.
Battling poverty and suppression, the 
Younger family struggled to understand 
each other while sticking together during 
hard times. Simultaneously occurring com
plications within the family made the play 
consistently interesting. Barriers between 
generations keep Lena (Linda Hunt) and 
her daughter Beneatha Younger (Pascale 
Armand) from understanding each other 
in the beginning of the play. While Lena 
understands what it meant to be a slave in 
America, Beneatha can only relate to 
what it is like growing up in America as a 
free individual.
Lack of communication between Ruth 
Younger (Brigitte Barnett) and her husDand Walter Lee (Ray Anthony Thomas)
Linda Hunts performance as the mother 
was a convincing one. Although from the 
audience one knows that the people on 
stage in front of them are only actors, one 
really feels that they are a family that has 
lived together their entire lives. Similarly, 
Pascale Armand deftly brings to life the 
spirit of a young teenager who is rebelling 
and exploring her womanhood.
Brigitte Barnett convinces the audience 
that she and her husband have grown 
apart. Ray Anthony Thomass performance 
is authentic as well.
A Raisin in the Sun is entertainment. 
The standing ovation spoke for itself.
The City Theater will perform A Rasin 
in the Sun through Oct. 10th.

CHICKEN, from page LI
-meets some manly fowl or another, 
-each time proclaiming, It is al
ways forever, and it is always you. 
-That is, of course, until her love is 
jeither killed or taken from her.
> Finally, Chicken Little finds her 
destiny in the form of the Egg
head Professor, to whom she 
vows, Together from earthly love, 
we will reach for the divine. And 
in fact she does, as she spends the 
rest of her days with the egghead.
La Pulcina Piccola (translated: 
Chicken Little) has been hailed 
by the New York Times as 
wacky and wise, melodic and mis
chievous. Vitucci also provided 
the lovely singing voice of 
Chicken Little.
Vitucci orchestrated the show by 
projecting onto screens the move
ments of the clothespin characters 
she manipulated on stage. It seemed 
an ingenious idea, combining the 
simplicity of a clothespin with the 
complexity of opera, and it was ex
ecuted with all the refinement and 
polish of a regular Broadway show.
While Vitucci is responsible for 
writing the libretto and coming 
up with the concept for the show, 
the music belongs to two-time 
Tony Award nominee and
Grammy Award winning com
poser Henry Kreiger. The show 
was in fact performed off-Broadway with the New York Theatre 
Workshop in 1997, and has since 
gained much recognition for the 
author and performer. Vitucci is 
currently a nominee for an Ameri
can Theatre Wing Hewes Design 
Award for the design of the pup
pets used in the performance.
In all aspects, La Pulcina 
Piccola was a delightful perfor
mance, with a bit of sound ad
vice. To all you young men out 
there, be forewarned: A chicks 
love is a fickle thing.JYhN SH6

The Juliana Theory/Dawson High 
Split album Version 2.0 
Arise Records
2 first band
of this awesome split record, The 
Juliana Theory. This emo pop band 
hails from Greensburg, PA, and 
they sure do pack a punch. The 
band provides plenty of hooks and 
catchy emotional lyrics. They have 
the songs, attitude, and moves to 
make it to rock star status, as 
singer Brett Detar brings this b and
to a higher level and direction.
Detar displays his beautiful voice 
expressively in the bands intro
spective lyrics, and the music
pushes the vocals even further to 
bring an energetic blend of emo
tions. The Juliana Theory plays 
with passion and rocks out 
strongly. Watch for this band 
because they are going to take 
the world by storm.
The other band on this split 
release is Dawson High. They 
also come from Greensburg, PA 
and play pop rock a la Weston 
style. The bands singer, Joshua 
Kosker, has a boyish charm to 
his voice, bringing added sincer
ity to the love songs. Songs about
girls and relationships prevail; 
with both bands.
This album is the new Version; 
2.0 of a sold-out first pressing of; 
the split record. This time; 
around, there is a new layout 
and an extra song from each; 
band. The album had a delay of; 
about four months because of 
scheduling delays at the print-; 
ing presses, but it is finally out.'

Entrapment
Saturday, September 25
Yo fellas. A couple of weeks ago I suggested to you 
that Notting Hill really might not be a chick flick. If 
you were disappointed, heres your reward for suffer
ing through a Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant attack.
Entrapment features the best of both worlds for a 
male moviegoer. First of all, youve got the guys guy: 
Sean Connery. To complement him, youve got a very

Babe 2: Pig in the City
Thursday, September 23
Its time for the second installment of DH 2210 
Theater. This weeks piece is called All The People 
Who Actually Went To See This Movie And What 
They Thought of It. Here goes:
Pig #1: Oink, oink.
Movie Critic #1: Not too bad for a sequel!
Pig #2: Squeal! Squeal! Squeal!
Movie Critic #2: Im surprised no one went to see this 
movie in the theaters.
Pig #3: Baaaa-ram-you! Baaaaa-ram-you!
Movie Critic #3: The visual imagery in this movie is 
astonishing. Its pure candy for the eye!
Air Bud: Bark, bark! [Thinking.] Gee, the critics 
seem to like this animal movie a lot better than mine. 
Perhaps I should stop production of my tenth sequel, 
Air Bud: Master Pole Vaulter. Everyone seemed to get 
tired after Air Bud: Golden Receiver anyway. [Out 
loud.] Bark!

CMU students handle their anger and frustration in 
many different ways. Some vent it on the bboard 
graffiti.wrath, but unfortunately it appears defunct 
this semester. Others go to the O and pound a large 
order of fries into their pissed-off being.
Well, in this movie some people try to rebuild their 
lives by going much further away than Oakland. Im 
talking about one of those little islands off the coast of 
Alaska, man. Out there, a fisherman named Joe, who 
is still recovering from a sea accident a few years 
meets a singer who fives with her extremely 
indifferent daughter. Things seem to go smoothly 
until Joes half-brother comes to town. When the longlost quasi-family member comes back, hes looking for 
help with a drug deal  it gets very ugly after that.

so i am thinking what should I say to the next person that walks Into my office, all the posi
tions are filled, well i guess will interview him anyway, i told him to water the flowers and pul 
them In the sun, but now they are dead, i could see tiiem and hear them but no one else did 
so i felt a bit lonely there, may be we should have taken all the plates, and you could have 
put the TV under your t-shirt and jumped out the window, we are not going to wait here till 
morning, we're going to go. i can Imagine what he could have been saying when he was walk
ing back home, what a damn long walk, isnt she beautiful, yes she is and i am happy for the 
two of you. what do you think of food in a can. do you like it or not. i am so out of It today 
(9/18/99). do I need one sheet of vellum or one. do you remember the 4th day of school, 
3rd grade, me and you shared an apple together, come on how could you forget, you want to 
play hang man. yes its just 5 In the morning. I hope everyone that loses their cell phone finds 
it. sorry for waking you up A, and thanks for the extra shoulder S. peace OUT!!!
