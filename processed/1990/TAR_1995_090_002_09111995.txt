News Analysis

[Ed. Note: Second in a series]
Marty Rimm has had 15 min
utes of fame several times in his 
life.
As a high school junior, he 
landed on the front page of the 
local paper and had the state leg
islature talking about his exploits.
After high school, he was alleg
edly able to pull the wool over the 
eyes of developer Donald Trump 
and the gambling industry.
At age 30, as an undergraduate 
majoring in electrical and com
puter engineering, he was able to 
drag a reluctant CMU into the 
midst of a debate over pornogra
phy and the Internet.
And for a brief period this sum
mer, he was the darling of edito
rial writers, radio talk-show 
hosts, and conservative activists.
All this fuss came after Rimms 
paper, Marketing Pornography 
on the Information Superhigh
way  funded by CMU Student 
Undergraduate Research Grants
(SURG)  was released in an 
exclusive deal with Time maga
zine and a law journal edited by 
students at Georgetown Univer
sity.
Internet reacts to news of 
study
As word that Rimms study was 
about to be featured in Time 
leaked out in the academic world, 
people in the Internet commu
nity asked for the chance to peer 
review it.
However, Rimms deal with 
Time and the Georgetown Law 
Journal forbid any release of the 
study without his approval. The 
Journal would only release ab
stracts and the studys footnotes.
Rimm has pointed out that the 
study was academically reviewed 
by three legal experts, and their 
comments were published in the 
Journal alongside the study.
Some of the legal experts who 
were consulted, though, were 
shown only excerpts from the 
paper. David Post, a visiting pro
fessor at Georgetown and an ex
pert in Internet law, told The 
Press of Atlantic City that former 
editor-in-chief of the Journal 
came to him last year with tech
nical questions about the study.
But the editor refused to show 
him the paper itself, saying that 
Rimm had forbid it.
Post writes about the rebuff in 
his critique, called Preliminary 
Discussion of Methodological Pe
culiarities in the Rimm Study of 
Pornography on the Information 
Superhighway. 
They were unable [to release a 
copy of the study] because of a 
secrecy agreement they had made 
with Mr. Rimm, he wrote. One 
would have, perhaps, more confi
dence in the results of the Rimm 
study had it been subjected to 
more vigorous peer review.
Post called Rimms decision to 
publish the study in a law journal 
odd, since they dont usually pub
lish scientific or technical papers.
Kathy Ruemmler, current edi
tor-in-chief of the Journal, said 
that type of criticism was unfair. 
She said that the magazine was 
trying to further debate on the 
privacy and free-speech issues 
raised by the study.
We knew that this would be 
controversial. Thats part of what 
academic discourse is supposed 
to produce, Ruemmler said. The 
Journal didnt have the study 
scientifically reviewed because it 
wasnt concerned with the meth
odology behind the study.
And thats just what Rimm, try
ing to avoid a careful examina
tion, was counting on, charge his 
critics.

Faculty Senate votes this week on ban
By BILL VANDERMARK
Tartan Staffwriter
Censorship is an issue that has been plaguing 
the CMU campus since late last fall, when a draft 
of Marty Rimms controversial Marketing Por
nography on the Information Superhighway was 
first shown to the University administration.
What began almost a year ago may finally come 
to a close on Thursday, when the Faculty Senate, 
headed by Chair Teddy Seidenfeld, examines 
their proposal for the removal or restriction of 
certain bboards currently carried on the Andrew 
network.
Last year, a committee of students, faculty, and 
staff was appointed by President Robert 
Mehrabian to examine and research the alt. sex/ 
alt.binaries.pictures bboards. That committee, 
headed by Vice Provost Erwin Steinberg, set out 
to decide whether or not Carnegie Mellon should 
allow access to such bboards.
The Faculty Senate will vote on what policy to 
recommend to Mehrabian, but the Senates deci
sion will not be binding.
A group of Staff Council members headed by 
John McDowell, a senior software engineer in 
Computing Services, submitted a final report to 
Mehrabian on June 19. Within this report were 
the findings of the Steinberg committee and rec
ommendations on whether or not to keep free 
access to the bboards in question. These findings 
and recommendations can be found on a variety 
of official.* bboards.
The policy that is set forth is designed to meet
four requirements. First, to keep open a free 
flowing exchange of ideas. Second, to allow 
Carnegie Mellon to operate the Andrew system 
within obscenity guidelines set by Pennsylvania 
law. Third, to keep administrative action to a 
minimum; and finally, to make good use of the 
Universitys computing resources.
I hope to see an open debate among the Fac
ulty Senate ending in a vote on the proposed 
issue, says Seidenfeld, a professor of statistics 
and philosophy.
Debate on the committees recommendations 
is expected to occupy the majority of the Senate 
meeting, aside from some minor business at the 
beginning.
This will be an interesting meeting, said one 
faculty member in computer science. Sparks 
will fly.
Those bboards in the alt.binaries.pictures.* 
tree that are targeted for removal are -.erotica, - 
erotica.bestiality, -erotica.bondage, -erotica.female, -.erotica.male, -.erotica.teen.male, and - 
.tasteless. Alt.sex* and rec.arts.erotica* 
heirarchies are not targeted because they con
tain primarily text.
Steinberg could not be reached for comment 
before presstime.
The Faculty Senate meeting will be held at 
3:30 pm in the Simon Auditorium in GSIA. 
Regular sessions are open to all members of the 
campus community. This includes faculty, staff, 
and students. Although only Senate members 
are permitted to vote, the debate will be open to 
those in attendance.

Carnegie Mellons latest report card 
: is in, and in some subjects, the Uni
versity has gone to the head of the 
class.
In U.S. News and World Reports 
\ annual survey of the nations colleges, 
j CMU captured 23rd place  up one 
* notch from last year  but CIT and 
GSIA-really have something, to crow 
about*. :
Thats because CMUs undergradu
ate engineering and Industrial Man| agement programs tied for third place 
in the nation among similar schools.
Im very pleased, said Mark 
Fichman, head of the IM department, 
j I feel lucky that people knew about 
| us, since some of the other schools 
were very large. He said hes particu
larly happy for IM students, faculty, 
and staff.
I think its a result of the reputa
tion of our faculty, and of GSIA, and of 
CMU. You get a halo effect thats 
part of the benefit of being at a good 
university, he said.
Vice President for Enrollment Bill 
Elliott said that he doesnt put much 
emphasis on numbers. Id rather be 
first than 23rd. Id rather be 22nd 
than 23rd. We want to be as strong as 
possible, said Elliott.
Elliott said that if he was ranking 
universities on his own, hed place 
CMU at around 15th in the nation. 
Ive been in this business 30 years, 
and my gut feeling as I look at the list 
is that we should be up around 15th, 
he said.
Carnegie Mellon is in good company 
on the U.S. News list. Harvard is at 
the top, with Princeton and Yale tied 
for second place. Stanford, MIT, Duke, 
Cal Tech, Dartmouth, and Johns 
Hopkins are among the institutions 
that placed higher than CMU, but the 
University beat out the hallowed halls 
of UCLA, Case Western Reserve, Bos
ton College, and Rensselaer.
I think the top 25 schools probably 
have missions and goals that are more 
similar than the schools ranked 50 to 
75, said Elliott.

Retail stores, swimming pools, game 
rooms, dining areas. You name it and 
youll find it in the new, as-yet-unnamed 
university center. The massive 240,000- 
square foot building will house every
thing that was in Skibo as well as the 
contents of the present Student Center.
University Architect Paul Tellers said 
the building is slated for completion in 
the fall of 1996, with occupants being 
able to move in on August 1,1996.
The project is a week and a half ahead 
of schedule and has not hit any major 
problems since the beginning of con
struction, said Tom Murphy, director of 
facilities planning and construction.
He said that he was thrilled that 
even after the building opens, it will still 
have 40,000 square feet of unfinished 
basement for future use.
Construction of the still-nameless university center is on time, say officials.
Sneak peak at buildings contents
Murphy provided a detailed descrip
tion of what the building was to look 
like.
The loggia  the long stick of the 
building that runs alongside the Cut  
will house a two-story retail area that 
will be home to an expanded bookstore, 
art store, and Entropy. During daylight 
hours, the retail space will be one large 
area, connected by open stairwells. At 
night, the bookstore will be sealed off by 
a rolling gate.
WRCTs new studios will be located at 
the west end of the loggia in the base
ment.
Continuing down the stick, you have 
the chapel, some ATM machines, offices 
for Student Activities, an information 
desk, and then an exhibition room, said 
Murphy. On the far south end is the 
quiet study area, now called the Alumni 
room, which will have miscellaneous 
items from the past in there.
Scotland Yard, a series of dining and 
meeting rooms, the Presidents Dining
Room, and the Faculty Dining Room will 
be housed on the second floor.
The entire third floor is made up of 
student organization offices. There will 
also be a game room and room for vend
ing machines.
In the main part of the building is the 
auditorium, which seats 450 people, and 
the racquetball courts and gymnasium. 
Opposite the gym are the diving and lap
pools. The dining facilities on the first 
floor open onto the courtyard, the big, 
horseshoe-shaped area facing the tennis 
courts.
On the first floor is a small facility that 
during the day will serve coffee and 
some ethnic foods, and at night will 
become a sandwich shop. On the second 
floor will be the three main cafeterias

Say it aint so: Candlestick Park loses grand old name
SAN FRANCISCO, Sep. 8 (D J)If 
you name it, they will moan.
San Franciscos venerable Candle
stick Park, home to the championship 
Forty-Niners and the less-than-championship Giants, has gone corporate. 
As of today, the Stick will be known 
as 3Com Park.
Thats after 3Com Corp. You know, 
the maker of computer-networking 
gizmos? Yesterday, the citys Parks 
and Recreation Department agreed 
to let 3Com pay $500,000 to have the 
stadium on this citys Candlestick 
Point named after itself for the next 
five months. 3Com proposes to even
tually pay a total of $4 million for the 
same right through 1999, when San 
Francisco hosts the Super Bowl.
City officials, who were looking for 
some way to offset the $26 million it 
will take to spruce up the windblown, 
earthquake-rattled old park are de
lighted with the deal. But the general 
fan reaction seems to be the same one 
the cellar-dwelling Giants have been 
hearing a lot this year: Boo!
The basic complaints: Turning their 
beloved 36-year old ballpark into a 
field of D-RAMs amounts to a sellout, 
and what the heck is 3Com, anyway?
I wonder how much San Francisco 
could earn by changing the name of 
Golden Gate Bridge to McDonalds 
Golden Arches Bridge? says Norris
Large, a San Francisco resident pro
testing the name change at the parks 
department meeting.
Adds Herb Caen, the famed San 
Francisco Chronicle columnist: If 
3Com, whatever that is, is trying to 
win our affection for a piddling $1 
million, it just blew the bundle.
The parks department says letters 
and phone calls have been running 50 
to one against the planned name 
change. Still, city officials note that a 
lot of stadiums are selling their names 
to corporate sponsors these days and 
that the B ay City is getting more money 
on an annual basis than any other 
city, including Denver (Coors Field) 
and Indianapolis (the RCA Dome).
I like the name Candlestick, too, 
says Jack Immendorf, chairman of the 
committee that voted for the name 
change. But we made a commitment 
to the Forty-Niners to fix up the sta
dium for the 1999 Super Bowl, and the 
city has to raise the money somehow.
3Com thinks fans will warm up to 
the new name. Spokesman David 
Abramson says 3Com will soon be a 
household product, like beer. 3Com 
also plans to provide access to the 
World Wide Web through in-park 
kiosks.
Abramson says that even famed 
Wrigley Field in Chicago is named 
after a chewing-gum business.
Cola wars raging in Europe
BUDAPEST, Hungary, Sept. 7 (DJ) 
Sitting at an outdoor cafe overlookingthe Danube in the Hungarian capi
tal, Istvan Fischer breaks into a smile 
as he picks up a glass of Coca-Cola.
I drank my first Coke in 1963, in 
Vienna, and my hands trembled, says 
Mr. Fischer, a 69-year-old pensioner. 
I was afraid because the Commu
nists told us that Coca-Cola was an 
intoxicating potion that left people in 
a stupor.
After just a few years, Coke, Pepsi, 
and a slew of other cola brands can be 
found not only in Budapest and War
saw, but also along the back roads to 
remote Transylvanian towns and se
cluded villages from Bohemia to cen
tral Bulgaria.
Since the collapse of communism in 
1989, the two companies have been 
bent on capturing the markets of East
ern Europe, pouring a total of $2 bil
lion into the region.
The payoff could be huge, officials 
from both companies predict. Like 
China and India, Eastern Europe is a
premier emerging market, they note, 
with more than 300 million consum
ers. Analysts forecast as many as two 
decades of dramatic growth in East
ern Europe before it levels off.
Pepsi was the first to enter the Com
munist world, signing a pioneering 
deal in1972to supply the Soviet Union. 
It used that foothold to expand into 
other East bloc countries.
But the business wasnt a success, 
Pepsi officials say, based as it was on 
agreements in which Pepsi bartered 
its flavor concentrate for Bulgarian 
forklifts or Romanian wine.
Forced to work with state-run bot
tlers, Pepsi also had little control over 
production, quality and supply.
By the time the Berlin Wall fell, 
Pepsi had an operating base, but its 
plants were old, inefficient and statecontrolled. Even worse, Eastern Euro
peans had forgotten it was a western 
product. We were seen as local, as 
part of the past, says a Pepsi spokes
person. Coca-Cola was seen as new 
and Western.
Groups protest WE-CBS merger
WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 8 (DJ)  
Two groups asked the Federal Commu
nications Commission (FCC) to block a 
planned takeover of CBS, alleging that 
buyer Westinghouse Electric has failed 
to provide adequate programming for 
children.
The United Church of Christ and the 
Center for Media Education filed a peti
tion with the FCC opposing the sale.
We want the FCC to develop a social 
contract between Westinghouse and the 
public, said a Center for Media Educa
tion executive, who spoke on the condi
tion of anonymity.
The contract, the executive said, 
should require Westinghouse to dis-. 
tribute more kids TV programs and to 
provide more air time for political candi
dates.
The FCC must approve the transfer of 
seven TV stations and 21 radio stations 
licenses from CBS to Pittsburgh-based 
Westinghouse. No other challenges have 
been filed with the FCC against the 
proposed sale.
The Center for Media Education has 
been a leading group is trying to get the 
FCC to adopt stronger childrens pro
gramming rules. The United Church of 
Christ actively weighs in on telecommu
nications proposals and issues before 
the FCC.
The challenge means that the sale will 
be delayed, for possibly up to six months, 
while the FCC investigates the petition. 
This is bad news for Westinghouse, for 
each delay in the pending sale means 
that another buyer could step forward.
Bill would block tobacco regs
WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 9 (DJ)  
Rep. L. F. Payne (D-Va.) and others 
introduced a bill to prohibit the Food 
and Drug Administration from regulat
ing the. sale or use of tobacco products.
Payne said the bill is in direct re
sponse to a proposed rule the FDA an
nounced last month under which the 
congressman said the agency would 
assume broad new powers over tobacco 
advertising, marketing and use in an 
attempt to deter smoking and other to
bacco use by minors.
I have never met a tobacco farmer or 
warehouse employee who would want 
their children to smoke cigarettes, said 
Payne. They want existing laws en
forced, and they want voluntary mea
sures to be given a chance to work.
What they do not want is for the FDA 
to use legitimate public concerns about 
teen smoking as a pretext for asserting 
its enormous regulatory jurisdiction over 
tobacco products, the Virginia congress
man said in a statement when he intro
duced his bill on behalf of a bipartisan 
coalition of about 20 House members.
Calling his proposal simple and 
straightforward, Payne said, It simply 
bars the FDA from proceeding with any 
regulations governing the sale or mar
keting of tobacco products.
He said that prohibiting the FDA 
from moving forward with these pro
posed regulations is not only consistent 
with existing law, it will send an impor
tant message to every other agency that 
attempts to issue regulations without 
express authority from the Congress.
Buchanan gets NH papers nod
WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 9 (DJ)  
Patrick Buchanan won a closely-watched 
endorsement as New Hampshires only 
statewide newspaper again backed his 
Presidential bid.
The Manchester Union Leader, long 
the most prominent conservative voice 
in the state that holds the nations first 
presidential primary, said approvingly 
that Buchanan has not shifted his posi
tions to curry favor with the mood of the 
moment. The paper also endorsed 
Buchanan in 1992 when he tried to take 
the Republican nomination away from 
then-President George Bush.
The newspapers endorsement is im
portant because it may influence the 
position of Governor Stephen Merrill, a 
highly popular figure, who hasnt yet 
endorsed anyone. The conservative gov
ernor has close ties to the Union Leader's. 
top management and isnt considered 
likely to take any positions that would 
put him at odds with the paper.
More schools requiring PCs
NEW YORK, Sept. 8 (DJ)  Many 
college freshmen starting school this fall 
will have more choices than ever in their 
fives.
But one choice a growing number wont 
have is which computer to use.
Although many colleges have for sev
eral years required students to own a 
personal computer, an increasing num
ber are expected to require an entire 
class to use one type of machine.
The advantages for the colleges and 
students include easier access to service 
and networking and lower costs from 
bulk purchasing. But the real winners 
are the computer makers, who have a 
captive audience and an opportunity to 
establish brand loyalty without med
dling from competitors.
That early exposure can pay big divi
dends for the companies. They get ac
cess to the demographic group most likely 
to buy their equipment in exchange for 
up-front prices that are often several, 
hundred dollars less than the students 
might pay at a discount computer chain 
store, and souped-up standard software.
The company with the largest share in 
the education market, Apple, benefited
from its contact with students, many of 
whom were loyal to Macintoshes long 
after graduation. IBM and Compaq are 
also signing exclusive college and uni
versity deals.
Wake Forest University plans to have 
all its incoming freshmen in 1996 using 
ThinkPads from IBM. The cost for the 
machines will.be included in the tuition 
for the Winston-Salem, N.C., school, a 
spokesman said.
The university has a pilot program for 
a smaller group of this years freshman 
class to use ThinkPads. I like it, said 
freshman participant Megan Cramer of 
Atlanta. With all the students using the 
same computer, its easy to help some
one else, Cramer explained.
Educators and industry observers 
know of no official studies tracking col
lege students computer-buying patterns 
after graduation, but there is anecdotal 
evidence that some people will return to 
the brand they used in college.
Kristie Hanley bought a Macintosh 
three years after she graduated from tht 
Newark, N.J., campus of Rutgers, which 
offered Macintosh to its students.
I was familiar with Macintosh, that 
why I wanted to buy it, she said.
Dartmouth has been primarily 
Macintosh campus since 1984, said Rick 
Adams, a school spokesman. The 
Hanover, N.H., school requires fresh
men to have a personal computer, and 
this year its recommending the 
Macintosh Performa 636.
Overall, students probably save 
around four percent when they purchase 
the computers from the colleges, com
pared to a discount computer store. In 
addition, their purchases usually include 
a variety of software packages and bet
ter quality perpherials.
Packwood will leave in October
WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 9 (DJ)- 
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (RKan.) said Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) 
will formally resign his seat October 1
In a statement on the Senate floor, 
Dole added that Packwood, found guilty 
by the Ethics Committee of sexual mis
conduct and abuse of power, will give up 
his chairmanship of the Senate Finance 
Committee immediately.
The timetable was outlined in letters 
exchanged by Dole and Packwood. 
Packwoods departure clears the way fori 
the Senate to take up the issue of who 
should take over the tax-writing panel 
for the rest of the 104th Congress.
Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) will re
place Packwood as chairman.
Its no secret that I have a conserva
tive and consistent economic philoso
phy, said Roth, suggesting he wants to 
create a robust economy. This is done by 
keeping taxes low and limiting govern
ment intervention. History has proven 
that when taxes are low, the economy 
grows. Its that simple.

The second floor will be home to the

Across the corridor from the audito

aerobics room, a weight room, and a 
food gallery.
Other projects underway
In addition to the $47 million uni

rently under construction behind 
Hamerschlag Hall, and plans for a 
performing arts center are underway, 
with renovations and additions to 
Doherty Hall not too far off.
All of the proposed buildings are 
part of the master plan made in 1987. 
The plan looked at the campus as a 
whole rather than one individual build
ing.
The latest plan is for the west side of 
campus, with the previous plan ad
dressing the east side.
Each building since then was not 
just plopped down, Tellers said. He 
said they intend to create outdoor

schools in the same category as their

The resulting rankings were then com

colleges, on what U.S. News considers 
measures of academic quality. These 
measures include student selectivity, 
faculty resources, financial resources, 
freshmen retention rate, and alumni 
satisfaction.
Elliott said its important to remem
ber that these factors dont necessarily 
say how good a university is.
Im not saying its a good measure or 
a bad measure, Im just saying that you 
have to understand what the numbers 
mean, he said. For example, Elliott said 
that U.S. News looks at faculty salaries, 
but the cost of living in many areas  
like Boston  is significantly higher 
than the cost of living in Pittsburgh. 
That has an effect on faculty salaries in 
those areas.
This brings up the whole issue about 
what value these things are, said Elliott. 
U.S. News does these to sell magazines. 
It doesnt say one school is better than 
another. Thats just the way the num
bers crank out.
This was the first year that the maga
zine ranked the undergraduate engi
neering and business schools. On the
engineering list, MIT and Stanford tied 
for first place. CIT is part of a seven way 
tie for number three; its neighbors in
clude Cal Tech, Cornell, Georgia Tech, 
University of California at Berkeley, 
University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, and University of Michi
gan at Ann Arbor.
The top business schools were Haas 
School of Business at Cal-Berkeley and 
the Wharton School at the University of 
Pennsylvania. CMU is tied for third with 
MITs Sloan School, the University of 
Michigan, and the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Elliott said its easy for some people to 
place too much emphasis on where they 
fall in a survey like this one.
Were all kind of rank-conscious in 
1995.1 think institutions spend a lot of 
time managing their numbers, he said, 
trying to affect their rank on lists like 
U.S. News. Thats not a good way to run 
an institution.
But the numbers are important highschool seniors, parents, graduate-school 
admissions officers, and corporations all 
look at the list, and it can influence their 
perception of a college.
Students and parents do pay atten
tion to these things to give them an idea 
of. the quality of an institution, said 
Fichman. Its not the first or last piece 
of information they use, but its cer
tainly in the margins. Weve had ratings
of the MSIA program, and students be
lieve it had a strong influence on their 
market ability.
Elliott pointed out that U.S. News list 
only ranked the top 50 schools. Think of 
the poor school that would have been 
ranked 51st [but didnt make the list]? 
he said.
They still have a very valid role in the 
education of this nation, said Elliott. 
Theres no such thing as a good school 
or a bad school, only the right school for 
the right people.
Fichman, whos been IM department 
head for a year, said that cant take 
credit for the departments current posi
tion. He said its taken five to 10 years to 
build the reputation of the undergradu
ate IM program, and that hes received 
the benefits of that long process.
I think we have the quality to belong 
in the top five or ten schools, he said.
We deserve it, but were going to have to 
work to keep it. And we will.
It takes a long time to change peoples 
perceptions, said Elliott. Twenty-five or 
30 years ago, Carnegie Tech was a re
gional school that recruited 60 to 70 
percent of its student body from the 
Pittsburgh area. Today, its a nationally 
and internationally recognized institu
tion.
Elliott has a message for students who 
would place a lot of emphasis on the U.S. 
News rankings. <cYou better come here, 
you better talk to our kids, and see how 
you fit. If you think this is the right spot 
for you, were going to have a great 
college experience, he said. If you think 
Cornell is a better spot for you, then you 
better go to Ithaca.
But if youre more concerned with 
where the school is ranked, then I think 
youre using the data in the wrong way.

Crime and Incident Report
ATTEMPTED BURGLARY,
9/2,4:07 am. A resident of Cathe
dral Mansions became frightened 
after she heard two men tamper
ing with the kitchen door, an en
trance into the apartment. She 
quickly went to that door and 
secured it with a deadbolt. After 
she locked the door she heard one 
male say, Oh shit, somebody 
locked the door!
She did not see the individuals 
but thought they were two men 
no older than 24. Other residents 
of the building were contacted 
and were told to contact the Cam
pus Police with any concerns.
OPEN LEWDNESS, 9/4,2:33 
am. An officer observed a CMU 
student urinating in the Marga
ret Morrison Rotunda area in full 
view of pedestrian traffic. While 
speaking with the student, the 
officer could smell a strong odor 
of alcohol on his breath.
After being questioned by the 
officer, the student admitted that 
he had been drinking at the fra
ternities. He claimed that no one 
checked his identification upon 
entrance into some of the houses. 
The student was issued citations 
for open lewdness and underage 
drinking.
ASSAULT, 9/4,3:55 am. A stu
dent living in one of the residence 
halls told two officers that he and 
his friend were in the Donner 
Recreation Room and wanted to 
play ping pong. When the stu
dent asked if he could play the 
next game, one of the residents 
who was playingbecame verbally 
abusive towards him. The resi
dent then jumped on the student 
who was asking to play. The 
attackers companion pulled his 
friend off of the victim. The vic
tim then left the area. A report 
was written and sent to Resi
dence Life for further action.
BURGLARY, 9/5, 3:04 am. 
Officers went to Woodlawn Apart
ments in response to a call that 
someone had possibly entered an 
apartment while the residents 
were away. The residents said 
that when they left the apart
ment, the back door to the fire 
escape was definitely shut, locked, 
and possibly bolt-locked. When 
they returned to the apartment 
about two hours later, the door 
was ajar and the deadbolt was in 
the unlocked position. There were 
no signs of tampering or forced 
entry on the door or the door 
frame. The residents found nothP .Philip Pelusi Offers Students Great Savings!

WATER LEAK, 9/6,10:07 pm. 
Two officers discovered a water 
leak in the Child Care Center. 
Kitchen personnel reported that 
there was raw sewage and toilet 
paper floating inside the bottom 
of the dishwasher. When the wa
ter leak was first discovered on 
September 2 there was almost 
two inches of water in part of the 
hallway. The water leak was not 
caused by a faulty dishwasher 
drain, but by the inability of the 
main sewage system in Morewood 
Gardens to handle the sudden 
demand put on it by students 
returning for the fall semester.
There have been reports that the 
system backs up every time there 
is a severe thunderstorm.
POSSESSION OF MARI
JUANA, 9/8,11:06 am. On Sep
tember 6 an officer was jogging 
past the East Campus Garage 
when he smelled the odor of burnt 
marijuana coming from a truck. 
A detective responded and saw 
two construction workers walk
ing through the garage.
The next day, an officer watched 
the truck with binoculars. Four 
other officers were in the area. 
Two construction workers came 
to the truck at about 12:01 pm 
and entered the cab. The officers 
noticed that the two workers were 
passing what appeared to be a 
hand-rolled cigarette between
them. When one of the officers 
walked past, the passenger put 
the rolled cigarette down below 
the dash and lit up what appeared 
to be a regular cigarette.
Police units moved in, identi
fied themselves, and ordered the 
occupants to exit the vehicle. A 
search showed a hand-rolled ciga
rette in a soda can. An officer 
found a small amount of sus
pected marijuana in a plastic bag. 
The suspects were transported to 
the police office where they were 
field tested. The test was posi
tive.
Both were charged with pos
session of marijuana. The fore
man was notified and the sus
pects were told that if they ever 
come back to CMU, they would be 
arrested for trespassing.

RIMM, from page 1
Among them are Donna 
Hoffman and Thomas Novak, 
professors of marketing at 
Vanderbilt University in Nash
ville, Tennessee. Theyre cur
rently conducting a five-year re
search program on marketingthe 
Internet called Project 2000, 
and were among those who have 
released detailed critiques of both 
the Time article and Rimms 
study.
In a response published on the 
World Wide Web, Rimm said that 
Hoffinan and Novak are upset 
simply because they werent 
asked to review the study.
We did not solicit Ms. 
Hoffmans or Mr. Novaks advice 
becaus we did not consider them 
experts in either computer por
nography or the law, wrote Rimm 
in his response to their critique of 
his study.
But as Hoffman points out, no 
outside party with a technical 
background was allowed to re
view the paper before its release
 on Rimms orders.
This guy wrote a bad research 
paper. Its obvious that Marty 
Rimm, whos a master manipula
tor, is operating out of this oneto-many model of disseminating 
information, said Hoffman. He 
controlled access to the study, 
and he hoodwinked [Time tech
nology writer] Philip ElmerDeWitt, but he was not able to 
control the people who had a voice
 the World Wide Web.
The view of the Internet com
munity was that this man did not 
want his manuscript peer-reviewed, but by God, hes going to 
get it peer-reviewed.
Indeed, Hoffman and Novak 
were not the only ones that pub
lished harsh critiques of the 
study. Dozens were written by 
people ranging from students at 
CMU and professional scientists 
to Brian Reid, the Digital Elec
tronics Corp. (DEC) programmer 
who wrote the arbitron script 
used to compile user statistics. 
Rimm used a modified version of 
Reids program to obtain the An
drew statistics used in his report.
I have read a preprint of the 
Rimm study of pornography and 
I am so distressed by its lack of 
scientific credibility that I dont 
even know where to begin cri
tiquing it, wrote Reid. Normally 
when I am sent a publication for 
review, if I find a flaw in it I can 
identify it and say here, in this 
paragraph, you are making some 
unwarranted assumptions. In 
this study I have trouble finding 
measurement techniques that are 
not flawed.
David Banks, a statistics pro
fessor who acted for a short time
as an advisor to the Rimm study, 
seems willing to chalk up some of 
the papers problems to inexperi
ence.
Hes an undergrad, so I dont 
expect him to have a lot of experi
ence with statistics or writing 
papers. That would be unreason
able, said Banks.
But Rimm has often said that 
his status as an undergraduate 
didnt matter  he seems proud 
of it, and claims that he was more 
than qualified to conduct the re
search and write the final paper.
Frankly, many people here are 
impressed that an undergradu
ate managed a team of more than 
two dozen researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon University, was 
published in one of the more pres
tigious law journals in the United 
States, and had the study he 
authored featured on the cover of 
Time wrote Rimm.
Should [Rimm] be considered 
a professional as an undergradu
ate? Has he demonstrated the 
skills of a professional scientist, 
or was he merely learning how to 
become a professional? said Pe
ter Madsen, director of CMUs 
Center for the Advancement of 
Applied Ethics.
Lack of professionalism
If Rimm wants to be considered 
a professional researcher, then 
he has to held to the same stan
dards as other professional re
searchers, and he hasnt met those 
standards, said Madsen.
Professionalism has a role here 
to play. It shows a clear lack of 
professionalism to try to gain as 
much publicity as possible for 
ones self, he said. Profession
als are dedicated to the service of 
society, not to themselves.
Time's Elmer-DeWitt has not 
answered a request for an inter
view, but in on-line discussions 
on the Well, an Internet service 
provider, he has made it clear 
that he shouldnt have published 
the story with Rimms restric
tions. I screwed up, he wrote.
This was a major report out of 
a prestigious university, pub
lished in a leading law journal, 
and, it seemed to me, a legitimate 
hook for a story that tried to put 
the issues it raised in some per
spective. Im sorry that so many 
... thought it failed to do that.
DeWitt was aware that many 
in the Internet community had 
serious reservations about 
Rimms research and his conclu
sions. But Time, in its search for 
an exclusive, was willing to bend 
to Rimms wishes and hope that 
the study lived up to Carnegie 
Mellons reputation.
Time magazine had an ex
tremely pivotal role in creating
this controversy and then they 
tried to shift the blame, said 
Ruemmler of the Georgetown Law 
Journal.
She said that the Journal's edi
tors were thrilled at the national 
attention for Rimms paper that 
the Time publicity juggernaut 
was creating. But the final prod
uct may have been a bit too sen
sational for their tastes. The cover 
included a headline screaming 
Cyberpom and featured a fullpage photo of a wide-eyed child 
illuminated by the glow from a 
computer screen. Inside, the fea
ture story was illustrated by pic
tures of a man having sex with a 
computer and a child being 
tempted by a computer screen 
with a lollipop on it.
We thought it was kind of ex
citing  a kind of a neat thing 
I was certainly shocked to see the 
photographs [on the cover and 
inside], said Ruemmler.
The Time story was just the 
thing for those trying to regulate 
the Internet. U.S. Senator 
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, waved 
a copy of Time on the Senate floor 
as he asked for support for a bill 
titled the Protection of Children 
from Computer Pornography 
Act.
This study raises important 
questions about the availability 
and the nature of cyberpom, 
Grassley told his Senate col
leagues. I want to emphasize 
that this is Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity. This is not a study done 
by some religious organization 
analyzing pornography that 
might be on computer networks.
Rimm was an instant celebrity. 
Mike Godwin of the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation debated 
Ralph Reed of the Christian Coa
lition on PJZC-HYsNightline. The 
topic? Marty Rimms study. Ra
dio talk-shows across the country 
clamored for the chance to inter
view him. A picture of Rimm, 
posed in front, of a computer dis
playing CMUs home page, ran in 
newspapers everywhere. He re
ceived an invitation to testify in 
front of the Senate. '
Its unusual for scholarly re
searchers to call media attention 
to themselves. Often, the work 
will call attention to itself, and 
the media will pounce on it, said 
Madsen.
Maybe we can criticize him for 
trying to make a big splash. Can 
we really fault him for that? said 
Ruemmler.
Lets hypothesize that heres a 
person that for the first time is 
the center of attention, said 
Madsen. It might be fun, and the 
temptation to have more fun 
might be there. Or, lets say he 
just didnt learn the craft of re
search well. He meant no harm, 
but just showed navet. Then, 
it's a whole new ballgame.
Vanderbilts Hoffman accuses 
Rimm of trying to influence pub
lic policy by shaping the debate.
This was positioned as some
thing from a research team at 
Carnegie Mellon, she said. The 
evidence is voluminous and points 
very clearly to an agenda, call
ing Rimms method of getting the 
study published subterfuge. 
His intent was to provide infor
mation that could be used by pub
lic policy makers.
It wouldnt have been the first 
time that Rimms research was 
able to influence lawmakers. Resi
dents of his hometown, Atlantic 
City, N.J., and casino owners are 
familiar with his previous work.
Well-known in Atlantic City
Rimm comes from a large, wellrespected, and well-connected 
family. His uncle is a New Jersey 
tax court judge. His first cousin 
sits on the board of commission
ers for Margate, N.J. His greatuncle sat on the states superior 
court.
Early on he showed a knack for 
publicity. His exploits have been 
well-known to the local paper, 
The Press of Atlantic City, for 
years. As a 16-year-old junior at 
Atlantic City High School, Rimm 
conducted a survey of his class
mates that he said showed that 
64 percent of them had gambled 
in the citys casinos.
But that wasnt all  he also 
claimed that he had disguised 
himself as an Arab sheik and 
infiltrated the Playboy Hotel and 
Casino. Rimm said that casino 
staffers gave him the red carpet 
treatment, offering him on-thespot credit.
Casino officials laughed at the 
study, but it landed Rimms photo 
on the front page of the paper  
in his sheik costume  and re
ceived widespread publicity. 
Their mood changed after the 
state-wide news coverage 
prompted the New Jersey legis
lature to raise the age for gam
bling in casinos from 18 to 21.
After high school, Rimm at
tended the University of South 
Florida before spending several 
years traveling in Europe.
In 1988, he returned to Atlan
tic City and began applying for 
work at the citys casinos. He 
wasnt just looking for a parttime job  he was also trying to 
learn about the gambling indus
try.
After being licensed by the 
states Division of Gaming En
forcement (DGE), he was hired 
by Donald Trumps Trump Plaza 
Hotel and Casino. He was appar
ently fired soon after for chronic 
absenteeism.
Next, he was hired by Trumps 
Taj Mahal as a security officer, 
neglecting to mention that he had 
previously been fired by the 
Trump Plaza.
Rimm left the Taj Mahal before 
the casino opened to the public, 
but apparently never returned 
his employee identification card. 
That was an important piece of 
information for state officials in
vestigating a series of hoaxes that 
involved Trumps casinos.
Pranks plague Trump casinos
In 1990, Rimm self-published a 
collection of short-stories called 
An American Playground, 
which told of a young artists look 
at the seamy side of New Jersey 
gaming, with particular empha
sis on Trumps resorts.
Visitors to the Taj Mahal in 
late June found fliers on their car 
windshields, printed on Taj 
Mahal letterhead, in which 
DonaldTrump himself hailed the 
book as one of the most phenom
enal literary events of the 90s.
In fact, anyone buying the book 
and presenting it at the Taj would 
receive $25 to spend at the ca
sino.
The problem was, the letter
head was stolen. Neither Trump 
nor the Taj Mahal knew about 
the promotion. The New Jersey 
DGE was called in.
The DGE documents obtained 
by The Press reveal that the in
vestigation focused on Rimm al
most immediately. Agents ques
tioning Rimm reportedly found 
him evasive.
[Rimm] gave only incomplete 
responses to questions and con
tinuously responded with vague 
and indefinite answers, the pa
per quotes one report as saying.
Rimm denied any responsibil
ity for the hoax, but admitted 
that he had seen the fliers.
A few months later, while the 
investigation was still open, hun
dreds of people received letters 
from the Taj Mahal telling them 
that they had won the casinos 
Rajas Riches contest.
The letters, on Taj Mahal sta
tionery, looked official. They of
fered prizes ranging from a RollsRoyce to $10,000 in cash, and 
went only to those who had en
tered the contest. Only someone 
from the casino, it would seem, 
would have access to the contest 
mailing list.
The Taj Mahal was swamped 
with inquiries from happy win
ners.
The problem was that the 
award letters were forgeries, too.
The letters, which were similar 
in appearance to the phony fliers,
claimed that Donald Trump 
would give a speech at the award 
ceremony called Whorehouses of 
Emotion, outlining his vision for 
Atlantic City.
In one story in An American 
Playground, a character pat
terned after Rimm gives his vi
sion for the future of Atlantic 
City. The storys title? 
Whorehouses of Emotion.
Rimm, who was working for 
Ballys Park Place casino, was 
once again in the DGEs hot-seat. 
He was ordered to appear for a 
formal deposition in front of the 
agency.
He was a prime target because 
of his suspected involvement with 
the previous hoax, and because 
he had allegedly never returned 
his Taj Mahal ID, and thus could 
have gained access to the casinos 
records.
At the hearing, he denied re
sponsibility for the hoaxes and 
refused to answer any questions. 
His failure to cooperate should 
have been grounds for the DGE 
to revoke his casino license, but it 
was set to expire and Rimm said 
that he had no plans to renew it. 
In addition, the Taj Mahal was 
reluctant to discuss the matter, 
seeking to avoid publicity.
The DGE dropped the matter.
Difficult to judge intentions
Rimms background, combined 
with the alleged deception of the 
bulletin board operators, could 
lead people to wonder about the 
veracity of the work and Rimms 
intentions, said the CAAEs 
Madsen. To be fair, maybe he 
botched the whole thing  lets 
suppose he made a mistake.
Only he knows his own inten
tions here. Its difficult to judge 
what they might be, Madsen 
said.
Hes done this stuff before, 
said Hoffman. I think we did a 
good job of trying to control the 
damage. If he had been allowed 
to read this stuff into the Con
gressional Record or been allowed 
to testify, it would have been a lot 
worse.
We knew that it would be con
troversial, said Ruemmler. 
Thats part of what academic 
discourse is supposed to produce. 
But I dont think thats what hap
pened. I think Marty Rimms per
sonal life and all this stuff is 
whats been coming up. For policy

Rimm a0r2i raises 
ethical questions
When a Carnegie Mellon 
alum landed his research 
project about pornography and 
the Internet on the cover of 
Time magazine, the Univer
sity was quick to applaud what 
the media was then calling 
the Carnegie Mellon Study
 it symbolized what CMU 
prides itself on: technology, in
novation and pioneering re
search.
But when the same study 
came under fire just a few days 
later, the University was not 
so proud, and worked ardently 
to become disassociated with 
it  a wise move.
Provost Paul Christiano 
formed an investigative com
mittee to examine the studys 
scholarship and methods.
Researchers on the project 
began taking their names from 
the studys cover page.
' It became clear that the 
study, and its flaws, belonged 
to Marty Rimm.
But Carnegie Mellon would 
remain wrapped up in the con
troversy as news' of the ECE 
undergraduates study spread 
to many magazines, newspa
pers, bboards and web page 
lacross the nation.
The damage had been done.
 Rimm monitored 89 per
cent of student, faculty and 
administrative Andrew ac
counts to see which users had 
subscribed, or evenjust logged 
on, to a pornographic bboard.
(Without asking permission).
 Rimm used data gathered 
from privately-operated adult 
bulletin board systems (BBSs) 
to make generalizations about 
the Internet  a completely 
different entity.
 Rimm misrepresented him
self to BBS owners to gain 
access to confidential informa
tion about subscribers.
 Rimm attempted to con
ceal his status as an under
graduate, and instead por
trayed his research as officially 
sanctioned by the University.
.  Rimm funded his 18-month 
study with SURG grants.
 Rimm did it. It was Rimms 
fault.
Unfortunately, Rimms study 
will always be linked to 
Carnegie Mellon  a stigma 
that hurts the University and 
its undergraduate research'ers. What can we do to ensure 
our researchers, and our Uni
versity, conduct ethical re-search?
, Some say undergraduate re
search projects shouldbemore 
closely monitored by the advi
sors who agree to oversee

them. This has its good and 
bad points.
No student wants a baby
sitter, but maybe more close 
attention should be paid to 
research  especially when it 
reflects a controversial, yet 
ambiguous topic like pornog
raphy.
Then again, no one wants to 
be censored.
Of course the true responsi
bility lies in the researcher 
him/herself, but after Mar
keting Pornography on the In
formation Superhighway, we 
should all consider the ramifi
cations of our own work.
In addition, it is important 
to determine what the re
search will be used for.
Rimms study was going to 
be used as empirical evidence 
by Republican Senator 
Charles Grassley, who is draft
ing a bill to limit what can be 
seen on the Internet.
CMU also examined Rimms 
work when making decisions 
about the censorship of our 
bboards.
In both cases, we see Rimms 
research was going to be used 
for censorship.
But the clincher was Rixnms 
methodology. In examining the 
files of 89 percent of this cam
pus without ever asking, he 
violated the right to privacy of 
almost every student, faculty 
member, and administrator on 
campus.
By manipulating the Unix 
system, Rimm was able to find 
out what bboards people 
looked at, when, and for how 
long.
The information was printed 
in a code, which Rimm figured 
out how to decipher.
In the BBSs, Rimm was able 
to obtain from the owners lists 
of names, addresses, and in 
some cases, credit card and 
social security numbers.
While the Internet and An
drew system are riddled with 
disclaimers regarding random 
monitoring, no one suspected, 
or authorized, Rimm to do the 
overseeing.
In retrospect, researchers 
need to find the truth, and 
pursue their study ethically 
and respectfully. When Rimm 
produced an unprofessional 
study that landed on the cover 
of Time and brought CMU into 
the spotlight, it compromised 
the Universitys credibility and 
reputation as being one of the 
finest research centers in the 
country, a blow it will take 
time to recover from.
Letters to the Editor
Student disturbed 
by view of women
Editor:
I strongly dis
agreed with the 
perceptions of 
CMU women and 
dating in Sharmila 
Venkatasulgbams 
article.
I think the article was extremely one
sided as well as demeaning to women 
and men on this campus.
First, the article only used interviews 
which described women as either re
pressed, promiscuous, rude, arrogant, 
and CMUs ever-popular, unattractive.
Letter to the Editor
My only assumption for this perspective 
is that the writer believed that this is 
how the majority of men at CMU feel 
about the women around them. I think 
most men and women on this campus 
would agree that there is a significant 
number of CMU men who do respect 
women on this campus.
I also believe that many men on this 
campus view us as more than the shal
low, ill-formed stereotypes promoted by 
the men interviewed for this article.
Second, I find it very ironic that this 
article and its negative depiction of CMU 
students claimed to be lamenting the 
fact that CMU is not a hotbed of ro
mance.
Fostering narrow-minded images of
women can only further damage rela
tionships between men and women on 
this campus.
Finally, I think that The Tartan should 
be more aware in the future about what 
they print as feature articles. In my 
opinion, articles which only represent 
one perspective usually belong, on the 
Editorial page.
The next time one of your writers is in 
need of a womans perspective on men, 
dating, or any issue, feel free to contact 
me anytime.

Social HistoryWar on drugs wages fools crusade
James Stepanek
Now s a fair warning for all you folks who read these 
columns last year, this will be something of a reprise of my 
one on the war on some drugs, but with some develop
ments. You may ask why am I writing what amounts to the 
same column again  well, there are two reasons. The first 
is that this is a terribly important subject which truly needs 
reconsideration by the public. The second is that the other 
things I was intending to write about require research and 
Ive gotten too lazy this week.
As everyone recalls, this nation tried an experiment back 
in the 20s. It was called Prohibition and was a massive 
failure. It tried to make the government impose a standard 
of morality on the people by criminalizing the drinking or 
production of alcohol. This is an example of a victimless 
crime, which the prosecution of is always a bad idea, as far 
as Im concerned.
Why did we do it in 
the first place? Well 
the same stuff we hear 
now: Lives are being 
ruined. Workers are 
screwing up due to in
ebriation. Huge 
amounts of money are 
being squandered.
Youve heard of all the 
same things with re
spect to the drug war.
All of them may even 
be true. The problem is 
that criminalizing 
these things does noth
ing to stop the use of 
the banned substance.
It just creates a thriv
ing black market in the 
illicit substance. Also, 
is it our business to pro
tect people from them
selves? Whats next, a 
war on flab?
This black market is quite a horrendous problem. You 
know about organized crime and other such pleasantries 
right? Well, they were spawned during Prohibition. The 
outlawing of alcohol provided a huge source of easy income 
for those willing to break the law. There proved to be no 
shortage of such people. From Prohibition, we got the Mob 
and the Mafia. Now with the drug war, we have the 
proliferation of the gangs.
Recently, Newt Gingrich came out and said something 
surprisingly lucid for a political figure. He addressed the war 
on drugs and explained that we only have two credible 
choices.
His first suggestion would be to give it up and stop wasting 
the resources, since its a lost cause the way were going. The 
second would be to impose such harsh, draconian measures, 
that no one in their right mind would be willing to run the
risks involved in the use of drugs. His first example is 
something which took a lesson from Prohibition. His 
second is something which takes a lesson from Saudi 
Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, if you are caught importing 
drugs they simply cut your head off. Saudi Arabia, need
less to say, doesnt have much of a drug problem.
This was an amazing statement for a major politician. 
He actually had the guts to even suggest ending the Drug 
War, which as a conservative, is tantamount to political 
suicide among many voting blocks.
Of course Bill Clinton and other statists had to ridicule 
the first suggestion. To think: removing the power of the 
government to intrude in our lives  we certainly cant 
have that. The media also followed the White House line 
with their usual ridicule of Newt.
Political reality then stepped in on Gingrich and he took 
the statist conservative course and came out advocating 
the draconian measures. I believe he has proposed a bill 
in Congress to mandate the death penalty for drug smug
glers.
As if the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of
people in prison for 
drug crimes al
ready isnt enough. 
Now, we have to 
start in on the 
drawn-out capital 
punishment angle. 
I have no problems 
with capital pun
ishment in the case 
of many crimes. 
This example is just 
a bad idea. Lets 
face it, the way in 
which capital pun
ishment is meted 
out in this nation is 
such a long, te
dious, and unpre
dictable process 
that it barely be
comes a deterrent. 
The draconian 
measures can work 
in Saudi Arabia 
simply because people do not have any civil rights there. 
You just get paraded in front of a judge, pronounced guilty 
(though if your accuser proves to be lying he gets offed), 
and orf with er ead. We cant do that here. There must 
be heaps of evidence and a drawn-out trial. The trial not 
being enough, we must have many replays through ap
peals. As if the court system isnt overburdened enough.
Lets face it, the prosecution of victimless crimes is 
antithetical to a free state. Unless you are willing to even 
further erode the protections of the Bill of Rights (which 
the Drug War has already done to an alarming extent), 
you can never win. Does anyone really feel that the 
problems caused by drugs are severe enough to sacrifice 
our freedom just to eliminate them?
James Stepanek is a graduate student in MSE. He 
welcomes any responses to his comments.

Columnist pleads for more courtesy
John Biggs
There are people who have no 
legs. There are people who move 
unbearably slow. In fact, there 
are even people who walk at a 
normal pace. These are three true 
things about people. It is also a 
fact that on this campus, people 
who ride bikes and in-line skates 
are out to get those people who 
have no legs at all, move unbear
ably slow, or even move at a walk
ing pace.
Now I dont want to complain. I 
dont want to seem old-fashioned or square, but I feel I 
deserve some room to walk with
out having to contend with 15 or 
20 people barrelling at me. I see 
some in-line skaters pound into 
doors, rumble down stairs, and 
even skate into lecture halls be
cause it just feels natural. How
ever, they usually look damn stu
pid doing it and take somebody 
down in the process.
I ride a bike. I try to stay on the 
grass or to one side of the side
walk. I realize some people walk 
like drifting rowboats, gee and 
yaw, twisting and turning as they your ears.
bop on down the road, and that is 
to be expected. However, there 
are also some who walk straight 
as an arrow and still risk life and 
limb. Skaters fly by. Bikers do 
wheelies over their toes at the 
last minute. Skateboarders ... 
they just kind of skate around 
making scraping noises. I guess 
we can leave them out. But there 
is still a danger to those walking, 
and those choosing an alternate 
mode of transportation.
Common courtesy, an old, and 
not so groovy idea, is what is 
needed here. People wearing in
lines shouldnt scoot through 
Baker Hall. I realize its all down
hill and its kind of fun, but didnt 
your mother ever tell you about 
inside locomotion and outside lo
comotion? Would you skate down 
the hall at home? People on bikes 
should holler On your left! at 
least 10 seconds before they shoot 
by. Both of these offenders should 
stay to the left, leaving the others 
to move freely on the right. Were 
big cats and kittens, here, we 
can all figure out our lefts and 
rights.
Take care and bear left. Slow 
down before you mow down. Life 
is hard enough without some 
weirdo on wheels whizzing past
Poor toilet paper produces pain in posterior positions
Eric Salzman
When I came to college, I was 
not expecting to maintain the 
greatest standard of living. Liv
ing in a dorm certainly wasnt 
going to be like 
a five-star ho
tel, and the food 
in Highlander 
would cer
tainly never 
compare to the 
illustrious
quality of ____________
Dennys. This 
was all okay
I expected as much.
However, when I wipe my 
ass, Id like to think that the 
University puts a little thought 
into my comfort. I dont need 
much. Its just that the biode
gradable, two foot thick, larger 
than life, rolls of cleanser make 
me sad. The sheets themselves 
are truly insufficient. With a 
quality product like Charmin, 
maybe a fold or two is all thats 
needed. The CMU special toi
let paper cries out for a mini
mum 6- or 7-layering to truly 
protect the hand.
University logic has got to be a 
cost-effective sort of plan. Not 
only is the stuff we get stuck 
with probably the cheapest for 
honest use, it also minimizes 
the risk of theft. Lets face it, 
students with apartments as 
well as students on campus who
when I wipe my ass, Id 
like to think that the Univer
sity puts a little thought 
into my comfort 
dont want to buy tissues, are 
not unfamiliar with the act of 
borrowing (but then, who 
would want it back after use?) a 
roll or two of the infamous white 
vapor.
What we need is a mutual bar
gain. Maybe if students sign a 
pledge promising to never again 
steal the campus toilet paper, 
the University will agree to buy 
quality brands.
Granted, this agreement 
would take a massive meeting of
the minds, butit couldbe done. 
Just think of all the benefits 
better toilet paper would bring 
to .our campus.
Better toilet paper would 
prompt students to feel more 
inclined to use the bathroom. 
Therefore, the switching of 
brands could help reduce the 
general constipation level on 
campus, making CMU a 
happier community. Also, 
with the amount of sitting 
CMU students do each day, 
there is certainly no advan
tage to sore rumps. The 
happier the rumps, the hap
pier students will be to sit 
(whether it be in a cluster, 
 the library, class, or pri
vate study area), the better 
their work will be.
The change would be dras
tic, so I know it cant happen 
overnight. Still, it could hap
pen. All of us: students, fac
ulty, and administration, need 
to work on this problem to
gether. Theres no reason that 
the porcelain wonder cant be 
the one issue to finally bring 
harmony to this campus.

Chicken salad reflects the problems of diversity
Kenneth J. Kraemer
I can remember those lunches at home when I was 
10.1 sat with my parents and any one to three of my 
siblings, and enjoyed a fresh chicken salad sandwich. 
I guess my parents thought it strange my affinity for 
chicken salad; I had acquired a taste for it at a pretty 
young age.
By my teenage years, I had found a particular 
chicken salad that I liked most. It was from the 
Duck-Pond Deli, in Huntington Village.
My brother, who worked there, told me of how 
Mrs. Stuppi made the garlicky-sweet salad from 
scratch; fresh barbecued chicken, crunchy celery, 
and cool, homemade mayonnaise. It was served 
on a round Kaiser roll with just the right amount 
of lettuce. And a pickle half-sour.
As much as I liked Mrs. Stuppis chicken salad,
I eventually moved on. The Community Market 
had opened not three minutes from my house. I 
tried their chicken salad sandwich one day in 
August, and found it to be just as good as Mrs. 
Stuppis. Although, perhaps, not as fresh.
After my successful experimentation with a 
new and different chicken salad, I became decreasingly attached to my favorites and tried the 
familiar variety of sandwich at a number of local 
delis. To my surprise, I found many of the 
sandwiches to be equally satisfying.
Then I moved to Pittsburgh, and sadly, to this 
day, I cannot to seem to find a satisfying chicken 
salad. Kanes Courtyard on Craig has a decent 
salad, but uses too much garlic.
The Yum-Yum Cafe, also on Craig, uses fresh 
pepper in their chicken salad. Though intriguing,
Im just not used to big chunks of pepper in my 
chicken salad.
Even our local retail services Co-op deli serves its 
version of chicken salad  far too wet  too much 
mayonnaise.
A friend of mine told me of a similar situation she 
experienced with bagels. It is fairly common knowl
edge that to get a good bagel, you should go to New
York, although New York holds no monopoly on the bagelmaking industry. So why is it so difficult to find a good 
bagel in Pittsburgh? Bageland bagels just dont cut it. 
Bunznudders bagels have the chewy-soft part down, but 
the actual outer texture and overall taste leave a lot to be 
desired. The only decent bagel Ive found is from Brueggers, 
which still does not capture the taste and style of a New 
York bagel. So, I came to a new city, some place Id never 
been before, and I expected everything to be the same as 
back home. Pittsburgh chicken salad should taste like 
Huntington chicken salad, and Pittsburgh bagels should 
taste like New York bagels.
everything, people included. A child raised in a predomi
nantly Caucasian environment leaves this homogenous 
area with the impression that everyone she or he meets 
will have the same cultural traits and values as she or he 
does.
Imagine the disillusionment the matured child expe
riences when she or he is thrust into a culturally diverse 
environment. How can the person possibly be expected 
to be objective in dealing with the people she or he 
meets?
I believe it is a fundamental choice that each person 
may make in his or her attitude whether to dismiss
To think this was an absurd assumption; instead of others as inferior, or to accept and embrace their differ
ences and learn from the 
interaction.
We all have a relevant 
and important contribution 
to make to society, and we 
cannot all contribute appro
priately if we do not first 
get past our differences.
These racial and ethnic 
differences in our society 
should not be the barriers 
and points of tension that 
they are, but should be as
sets to society; resources of 
different perspectives on 
societys issues.
If we are to succeed as a 
peaceful, truly equitable so
ciety, where all men and 
women are empowered to 
make meaningful and valu
able contributions to soci
ety, we must start with our 
children, and ensure that 
they are raised to value and 
perpetuate diversity. In ad
dition, we must all choose 
to appreciate the differences of a diverse society, and 
actively pursue and encourage such a diversity.
The co-ops chicken salad: A bastion of harmony?Jim Snyder/Acting Darkroom Manager
appreciating the softer texture of a Bunznudder bagel or 
the sweet taste of fresh pepper in Yum-Yums chicken 
salad, I decided they were inferior to what I was used to.
I dont think this assumptionis particular to me, though, 
nor is it particular to chicken salad and bagelsor food in 
general.
The truth is, this sort of assumption is made about
Ken Kraemer is a junior IM major and the Managing 
Editor of the Tartan. He looks forward to hearing from 
readers concerning their chicken salad finds around 
Pittsburgh.

Sophomore halfback Chris Neupaver avoids a Gator tackier in Saturday night's game against Allegheny.lSs0SCa 2M8Cg2 6i

By DARREN CHIAPPETTA
Tartan Staffwriter
Saturdays game between Allegheny and 
Carnegie Mellon appeared to be a prime opportu
nity for the Tartans. Even though they had a fivegame winless streak against the Gators dating 
back to 1987, Allegheny was weaker this year, or so 
it had been said. They graduated 16 starters from 
last seasons 10-1 team, including two-time Divi
sion III All-American quarterback Paul Bell.
But if it was Allegheny that was ripe for the 
picking, it was the Tartans who got plucked. Aided 
by five CMU turnovers and an outstanding perfor
mance by sophomore quarterback Kyle Adamson, 
the Gators amassed nearly 450 yards in total 
offense on their way to an easy 34^7 win in front of 
2,473 fans at Gesling Stadium.
Carnegie Mellon shot itself in the foot early and 
often, with two turnovers in the first quarter lead
ing to Allegheny field goals. Whenever the Tartans 
gained some momentum, they made a crucial mis
take, and the well-coached Gators would make 
them pay. CMU Head Coach Rich Lackner was 
disappointed with the teams performance.
We played extremely poorly, he said. You cant 
do the things we did and expect to beat a good 
football team.
As badly as Carnegie Mellon played, Allegheny 
played just as well. Adamson, making his first 
varsity start, played like a veteran, completing 19 
of 23 passes for 250 yards and four touchdowns. In 
one stretch spanning the second and third quar
ters, Adamson completed 13 consecutive passes, 
just four short of the Division III record set in 1990 
by former Tartan quarterback Bill Snyder.
He didnt make mistakes, said CMU senior 
linebacker Tom Bender, and when we did, he 
capitalized on them.
Carnegie Mellons bad luck began on the games 
opening series. First, a holding penalty on the 
kickoff backed the Tartans up to their own nineyard line. Then, although their first two plays from 
scrimmage netted 10 yards and a first down, the 
Tartans lost their two offensive captains.
Senior tight end Aaron Neal, who had been 
honored on national television earlier in the day as 
the Division III Academic All-American of the 
week, broke his fibula on the first play. Mike 
Mathias, the senior halfback who scored twice and 
led the Tartans in rushing last week, broke his foot 
on the following play, leaving CMU without two of 
its biggest offensive weapons and, more impor
tantly, two of its leaders.
I dont know what affect it had on the team, but 
anytime you lose both your captains, it has to 
shake you a little bit, Neal said.
With Mathias and Neal on the sidelines, the 
Tartans moved only eight yards after their initial 
first down and were forced to punt. Thats when 
Adamson took over.
On Alleghenys first offensive play of the season, 
the sophomore found tight end Nathan Six for a 41 - 
yard completion, moving the ball to Carnegie 
Mellons 19. Three plays later, the Gators were in 
the end zone, courtesy of a beautifully-thrown ball 
by Adamson. On third down from the 14, Adamson 
zipped a sideline out pass to Ronnie Anderson just 
in front of lunging Tartan senior cornerback Rob 
Locke. Anderson hauled it in at the five and waltzed 
into the end zone for a quick 7-0 lead.
The Tartan defense was back on the field quickly 
after senior fullback Lee Antons fumble on CMUs 
next play from scrimmage set up the Gators at the 
Carnegie Mellon 15. The defense held, however, 
forcing a 21-yard Jake Merski field goal, and mid
way through the first quarter, Allegheny led, 10-0.
It was more of the same for the Tartans on their 
next offensive possession. After a roughing the 
kicker call set CMU up in fairly good field position, 
senior quarterback Keith Dickerson threw the first 
of his two interceptions on the night. Allegheny 
cashed in early in the second quarter on a Merski 
field goal from 39 yards, for a 13-0 lead.
Dickerson and sophomore receiver Ricco Parrish
seemed to be having communication problems sev
eral times in the first half, with one frequently 
misreading what the other was supposed to be 
doing. Consequently, Dickerson overthrew Parrish 
on more than one occasion, leading to both of the 
quarterbacks interceptions.
None was more costly than when the Tartans, 
down 130, drove deep into Gator territory late in 
the first half. Four plays after senior punter Frank 
Triggiani completed a pass to Locke on a fake punt 
to give CMU a first down inside Alleghenys 30, 
Dickerson tossed one well over Parrishs head into 
the back of the end zone, where Gators cornerback 
Pat McMahon cradled the ball for his second inter
ception of the night.
With 1:21 to go in the half, it looked like Allegh
eny would be content to run out the clock. However, 
after junior tailback Kyle Smesko broke off a 32- 
yard run on the first play of the drive, Allegheny 
went for the kill. With two receptions each by 
Anderson and Six, Allegheny moved 80 yards in 
seven plays, with Adamson throwing to Six for an 
eight-yard touchdown with 0:09 remaining, giving 
the Gators a 20-0 halftime lead.
Lackner indicated that the turn of events at the 
end of the half may have been the backbreaker for 
the Tartans, but he was quick to spread the blame 
evenly.
That was a little bit of a killer. We were knock
ing on the door, [and] it was a 14-point swing. [But] 
this loss was a team effort, all the way around. We 
dont blame a loss like this on one kid.
In all, the Tartans turned the ball over three 
times in the first half, leading to 13 Allegheny 
points. Adamson was a staggering 14 of 16 for 146 
yards and two TDs in the first 30 minutes of play.
Bad got worse for CMU on Alleghenys first drive 
of the second half. On a second-and-10 play from 
their own 44, Adamson came down the line of 
scrimmage as if to run the option, then took one 
step back and fired a bullet to Anderson, who 
caught the ball at the Tartan 40 and outraced the 
Carnegie Mellon secondary to the end zone for his 
second score of the night and a 27-0 cushion.
Late in the third quarter, CMU was able to 
extend its Division III record by scoring in their 
217th consecutive game, as Dickerson capped off a 
6-minute, 23-second drive with a leap over the top 
for a one-yard touchdown run. Dickerson looked 
sharp in the series, completing two of three for 31 
yards, including a 28-yard completion to sopho
more Chris Neupaver, filling in for the injured 
Mathias.
Allegheny used much of the fourth quarter to 
show off their huge offensive line, which averages 
250 pounds, running the ball almost exclusively in 
the final stanza. With 9:14 to go in the game, 
however, Adamson went back to the air and threw 
his fourth touchdown of the night, a perfectlyplaced 30-yard toss to John Jones down the far 
sideline for the games final points.
In addition to Adamsons fine performance, the 
Gators also had their way on the ground, with 
Smesko leading the way with nine carries for 86 
yards. The Gators totaled 444 yards on the night.
On the Carnegie Mellon side, the quarterback 
rotation that worked so well last week was largely 
ineffective. Dickerson finished the game 5 for 12 
for 63 yards and two interceptions, while senior 
Dave Soltysik was 5 for 14 for 54 yards. In fairness, 
it should be noted that both signal callers were 
plagued by dropped passes. Dickerson finished as 
the top ground-gainer for the Tartans, picking up 
24 yards on seven carries.
If there is one saving grace the Tartans can take 
from this loss, it is the fact that it comes in just the 
second week of the season. The playoffs, always the 
primary goal for CMU, are still within reach, but 
the Tartans will likely have to go undefeated the 
remainder of the season. Lackner and his troops 
will attempt to start that streak this Saturday at 
Gesling against Rhodes College at 7:30 pm.
I asked our kids not to quit on us, and we told 
them we wouldnt quit on them. We just have to go 
out there and regroup next week.

The womens soccer team split their games this 
past week, losing a close one to Case Western 
Reserve University, but dominating Waynesburg 
College earlier in the week.
The team team lost a heartbreaking match on 
Saturday at Case. The 1-0 loss came after a long, 
hard battle that went to the final seconds of a 
double overtime period.
Both teams started the game slow, and had 
trouble putting together offensive drives. CWRU 
controlled the ball for the majority of the first 
half. CMUs defense performed very well, break
ing up drives to their net, but the team couldnt 
seem to keep it out of their territory for very long.
After halftime, CMU came alive, pushing hard jump up just as the ball came in, catching it with 
into the CWRU defensive line. The Tartans were her fingertips. Time ran out on the clock, still
jumping kick that sailed back over her head but 
went just wide of the net and an astonished 
goalie. The remainder of the time in the second 
half was spent with the Tartans and Spartans 
exchanging possession and taking turns threat
ening the others defensive team.
As the two teams entered the first overtime 
period, CWRU again put CMU on the defensive. 
Again, Case Western was defeated by the Tartan 
defense, but managed to keep the ball deep in 
CMU territory for much.of the overtime period. 
As the clock began running down again, CMU 
had another close shot on the CWRU goal. Again, 
the CWRU goalie fell to the ground while block
ing a shot, leaving the ball rolling across the front 
of an open goal. Umeda shot the ball hard at the 
center of the goal, but the goalie managed to
running the CWRU defense ragged, as they 
managed to quickly reverse many of Case 
Westerns offensive pushes, and kept up the 
attack in the first part of the second half. Yet the 
CWRU defense continually broke up plays to
ward their net, leaving both teams bunched up 
and unable to make plays.
Toward the end of the half, CMU put together 
a very well-organized attack. Crossing the 
midfield line, senior midfielder Maria Casella 
passed the ball to 
freshman midfielder 
Catherine Duda. Un
der pressure from the 
CWRU defense, Duda 
passed back to 
Casella, who passed it 
to sophomore forward 
Kim Umeda. Umeda 
shot on goal, but it was 
blocked by a defender 
and rolled out, seem
ingly stealing the life 
from CMUs offensive 
drive. However, on the 
throw-in from sopho
more midfielder/ 
forward Lauren DeRosset, Umeda per
formed a dramatic
leaving a scoreless game.
Most of the final overtime period was marked 
by hard fighting at midfield for possession of the 
ball and strong Tartan offensive pushes. In the 
last five minutes, the tide turned against CMU 
as Case Western began a series of powerful 
drives deep in the Tartans backfield. Off of a 
CWRU comer kick, the ball rolled free across the 
front of the goal, but the Tartans cleared the ball

Mens soccer battles through pair of overtime matches

The mens soccer team is still in search of their 
first win this season after a pair of overtime matches. 
They opened the season with a tie against cross
town rival Point Park College, and then dropped 
their first UAA match to Case Western Reserve 
University.
The team is showing its inexperience, with four 
freshman starters and upperclassmen who arent 
used to their leadership positions. As the team 
gains experience this season, their skill and deter
mination are sure to put them back on the winning 
track.
On Saturday afternoon, the Tartans traveled to 
Cleveland for their first UAA matchup of the sea
son with Case. The Spartans got on the board first, 
but the Tartans were able to send it into overtime 
with a goal in the closing minutes. However, a few 
defensive breakdowns allowed CWRU to score twice 
in overtime to end the match with a 31 loss for 
Carnegie Mellon University.
The Tartans controlled the ball for a greater

Park player in their match last Monday.
portion of the first half, and they had quite a 
number of free kicks and corner kicks. However, 
they were not able to get off many good shots on net. 
On the opposite end, occasional defensive break
downs allowed Case to take a few good shots on 
freshman goalkeeper Justin Petro.
After a scoreless first half, the second half was a 
bit more open, with neither team controlling the 
game. CWRU was able to tally more shots, and 
with nine minutes remaining, sophomore midfielder 
Niall Casey of Case headed in a cross from a free 
kick.
Weve got to foul less, said Head Coach Nick 
Gaudioso. They [Case] got their first goal becase of 
a foul.
Tempers started to flare near the end of the game 
due to some questionable refereeing. Then, with 
time winding down, the Tartans breathed a sigh of 
relief as a shot by senior midfielder Alan Levin was 
deflected into the goal by a Case defender. Regula
tion ended with the teams tied at one.
The Tartans seem to come alive in overtime, only 
to allow a goal with two minutes remaining in the 
first half of overtime.
Gaudioso attempted to spark his team with a 
couple of substitutions for the second half of over
time, but the Spartans struck quickly. In 
the first minute, sophomore midfielder 
Suleman Al-Ajaji of Case scored on a 
charging, sliding Petro to put the game 
out of reach for the Tartans. CMU lost by 
a final score of 3-1.
I did see hard work the entire game, 
said Gaudioso. Thats what we need right 
now.
The Tartans fought hard against Point 
Park College last Monday, but the game 
wound up tied 22 after regulation and 
two 15-minute overtime periods.
It looked as though the game was going 
heavily in favor of the Tartans, with their 
first goal coming after only about three 
minutes of play. Sophomore forward Akira 
Imai placed a corner kick right to the top 
of Point Parks penalty box, setting up 
Levin with a header into the back of the 
net. The Tartans continued to dominate 
the middle of the field for about the first 
20 minutes.
However, Point Park got an opportu
nity about halfway into the first half. The

Turf contains hidden costs
Gridiron Grapevine
by Steve Chamoubi
Oh, Astroturf.
These were the first words that came 
out of Ki-Jana Carters mouth as soon as 
he found out that he was drafted as the 
top overall pick by the Cincinnati 
Bengals. Its almost as if Ki-Jana knew 
then that the turf at Cincinnatis 
Riverfront Stadium would sideline him 
for his entire rookie season.
Astroturf is the green grass-like car
pet that covers half of the playing fields 
in the NFL. Gesling Stadium here at 
CMU uses Astroturf on its athletic field, 
along with Pittsburghs Three Rivers 
Stadium, and most mini-golf courses 
across the country.
Astroturf allows a stadium to hold 
plenty of sporting and recreational 
events with only a minimal amount of 
maintenance required. It can be used 
year-round and can cover up the dirt 
areas on a baseball field to convert it into 
a football or soccer field. Another char
acteristic of Astroturf fields are the socalled turf injuries.
In the 1950s, the leading cause of 
injuries to offensive and defensive line
men was low chop-blocks to the knees 
and legs. The NFL took action and pro
hibited low blocks. In the 1970s, the 
leading cause of injuries to linebackers 
and defensive backs was spearing, tack
ling with the helmet. Spearing was soon 
abolished. This year, the NFL is trying 
to crack down on late hits on the quar
terbacks. For the past five decades the 
NFL has been making rules to protect 
players from getting injured by other 
players.
Today, the leading cause of major in
juries to players comes not from the
opposing team, but from the ground the 
players run on.
Astroturf is a harder surface than 
grass, so getting tackled on turf causes 
players to get more banged up and 
bruised. The worst feature of turf, 
though, is how adhesive it is. The turf 
will literally cling to the bottom of a 
planted foot. During the Steelers home 
opener, on an attempt to tackle Barry 
Sanders, Rod Woodson, the Steelers AllPro comerback, tried to cut back outside 
by planting his right leg into the turf. 
His leg stuck, and before he could free 
his leg, his knee gave way, and he tore 
his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). 
This is the same injury that took out KiJana Carter after his third-ever NFL 
carry. This is also the same injury suf
fered by a leading administrator last fall 
while playing soccer on the ar
tificial turf. Several 
other people have 
gotten injured 
running on 
the turf at f 
Gesling sta- \ 
dium.
I was run
ning back an in
terception. All I 
had was one guy 
left to beat. I 
planted my right leg into the turf 
to cut left. All of a sudden my foot 
shifted a few feet and then stuck to the 
turf. My knee buckled. I heard a pop, 
and the next thing I knew was that I 
snapped my ACL, explained Jay Blanco, 
a comerback for the 69ers, a CMU intra
mural football team. I know at least six 
other people who got injured the same 
way.
Playing on turf takes some getting 
used to. Players have to try to remember 
not to cut too hard and not to shift all of 
their weight to one leg when they cut. 
The problem is that in the middle of a 
game, trying to remember how to turn is 
not the most important thing on a 
players mind.

The Pigskin Pundit
by Chris Cannon
Every year a group of portly, coffeedrinking sports journalists and coaches 
vote for the NCAA Division I football 
champion. College football games and 
columns are ignored because the fans see 
little point when a group of sportswriters 
is going to determine the national cham
pion anyway. Democracy is great and all, 
but theres only so much of it I can take.
College basketball is huge because they 
have one last, bigeverybodys-invited 
tournament, where tiny schools like 
Western Kentucky have the chance 
and talent to take on mighty 
Michigan.
In comparison, col
lege football contin
ues to flounder. 
Improvements 
have been 
made in the
Ryan Rhoads/Tartan Art Staff
bowl system, but it still has no 
true national championship. College 
football is an odd sport where your team 
can go undefeated and still not win a 
championship, as Penn State fans discov
ered last season. This year, another team 
may be robbed of its chance for several 
reasons.
The team to watch for is Florida State, 
which has never lost a game in the ACC. 
Their only difficult games are against a 
declining Miami team and Florida, who 
they traditionally beat. Even if they lose
one of these games, they will probably be 
respected enough to earn a high enough 
ranking to play in the national champion
ship, as they did in 1993. They are cur
rently ranked number one and should be 
playing in the Fiesta Bowl.
The big party will be held at the Fiesta 
Bowl, because that is where the bowl coa
lition has decided this years national 
championship will be played. The bow] 
coalition is a group of old men  and old 
women, I presume  who are chairmen of 
the bowl games. The bowl games are all 
played on or around January 1. For the 
past few years the coalition has collabo
rated to try to insure a national champion
ship in one of their bowls and big money in 
one of their pockets.
The championship game is now a con
test that takes turns at different bowls 
every year. It tries and fails to make the 
top two teams play each other. However, 
there is no guarantee that this game will 
feature either of the top two teams. Why: 
Two words: Rose Bowl.
The Rose Bowl is not part of the bowl 
coalition. It is an annual New Years Daj 
matchup between the regular season win
ner of the Pac-10 conference and the Bi[ 
Ten. The winners of these two conference J 
are not eligible to play in another bow! 
game, though schools that did not win the 
conference play in other bowl games. If the 
following scenario shapes up, the bow! 
coalition will be foiled.
The big day to watch for is November 18 
On this day the University of Califomi; 
at Los Angeles and the University o 
South CaHfomia will meet for their regu 
lar season finale. UCLA recently trouncei 
the University of Miami, 31-8. This i 
important because UCLA is in the Pac-10 
and Miami was the loser of the national 
championship game last year.
The Bruins look good this year and are 
set to go undefeated until they play inter
city rival USC. The Spartans are highlj 
touted, after virtually disappearing in th( 
1980s. USC, also a member of the Pac-10 
is Sports Illustrateds pick to win the na
tional championship. Whoever wins the

rame wiil be highly-ranked and 
vill probably win the Pac-10. If 
ihis happens, the winner will next 
ilay the Big Ten champion in the 
,ose Bowl.
How strong is the Big Ten? In 
,heir season opener, the Northestem Wild Cats, the perennial 
oormats, beat Notre Dame, preiously ranked in the top 10. 
'urdue beat number 23 West 
Virginia 26-24 in their opener 
and nearly knocked off Notre 
Dame this week. Ohio State, con
sidered the third-best team in 
the conference, is nationally 
rankednumber nine.
The Michigan Wolverines have 
not been 3-0 since 1986, but they 
easily tallied their third win this 
week. The Wolverines may not be 
stopped until they meet Penn 
State. The Nittany Lions, unde
feated last year, could be unde
feated again when they play 
Michigan. The Penn State-Michigan matchup is also on Novem
ber 18. The winner will look very 
impressive and will probably win 
the Big Ten.
Besides the situation of the Rose 
Bowl, there is the threat of the 
SEC. Auburn comes off a twoyear NCAA probation that has 
prevented them from playing in 
I bowl games. They have lost only 
j one game over the last two years 
| under Terry Bowden, now entering his third year as the Tigers 
:head coach.
Cross-state rival Alabama is 
j going onto probation this year 
and cannot participate in any 
bowls. If the Crimson Tide plays 
like the Tigers did on probation, 
they could ruin the chances of 
any SEC team playing for a na
tional title. When do Alabama 
and Auburn play each other this 
season? November 18.
What all this means is that the 
alleged national championship 
game that the bowl coalition has 
fabricated may not include the 
top two teams in the country. A 
team with two losses could wind 
up in the Fiesta Bowl. Its a shame 
that the championship will be 
settled on the desk of a pencil 
pusher, instead of on the grid
iron.
I have switched my column to 
college football coverage, so ex
pect predictions and thinly-veiled 
attempts to get attention in the 
weeks to come.

but in reality, they lose money. The 
amount of money an NFL team makes 
is directly related to how good the 
team is. Playoff teams usually sell-out 
theirgamesandmakealotmore money 
in merchandise than non-playoff 
teams. If a team starts losing its star 
players, the team starts playing worse, 
and the owner loses money.
Of all the season-endingiryuries over 
the past five years, about 82 percent 
happened on artificial turf. 85 percent 
of the players in the NFL prefer play
ing on grass to turf, and in this age of 
free-agency having a grass field may 
make the difference to where a player 
will sign. Before he signed with the 
Dolphins, Steve Emtman said that he
would only play on a grass field.
Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, both 
of which have turf fields, claim that 
taking care of grass fields in the north 
in winter is impossible, despite the 
fact that Cleveland and Chicago, two 
other cold-weather cities, have no 
problems taking care of grass fields.
Hopefully the league will do some
thing to try to prevent turf injuries. 
Otherwise, players are going to keep 
on receiving turf-related injuries. Its 
just like Rod Woodson said: Ive 
played on_turf for nine years, and 
sooner or later its going to grab you."

OVERTIME, continued from page 9
Tartan midfielders got caught upfield 
and couldnt make it back to help out on 
defense. An opposing forward took ad
vantage of the situation, tying the score 
at one goal apiece.
We had about three guys walking at 
a time when only one should have been, 
said Gaudioso. Control of the ball was 
about even between the two teams for 
the remainder of the game.
About 20 minutes into the second half, 
sophomore midfielder Jason Buelow 
headed a ball to the overlapping right 
midfielder, fifth-year senior Chuck Kuba, 
who put it away to give the Tartans the 
lead once again.
But then, with less than a minute to 
play in regulation, a Point Park 
midfielder sent a cross in front of the 
net,where it deflected off a Point Park
forward, leaving the Tartan goaltender 
virtually no chance.
The overtime periods were very in
tense. Both teams hit a goalpost once, 
and a Point Park player received a 
yellow card. However, no goals were 
scored.
The team lost freshman goaltender 
Brad McNutt who left the game after 
10 minutes with a knee injury. He 
should be back in action again this 
week.
Weve got a long way to go, said 
Gaudioso. The only way to get better is 
to get experience.
This week, the Tartans will square 
off against a tough squad from Tennes
see, Maryville College on Thursday 
night at 7:30 pm. Then this Saturday, 
they will host the University of Chicago 
for a UAA matchup at 11 am.

The mens and womens tennis teams began 
the 1995-96 season with victories and have 
remained undefeated so far. The womens 
record is 5-0 while the mens record is 1-0.
The top eight players for the womens team 
are: freshmen Keri Mills, Karin Tuxen, Jillian 
Watkins, Julie Balch, andMiklaneFedorowich, 
junior Michelle Cook, and seniors 
Miriam Huang and Namita 
Amin. The top three seeded play
ers are freshmen. Team captain 
Miriam Huang commented on 
the new line-up, Were lucky to 
have a wonderful group of players 
and with our record being at 50, were very 
confident.
The womens first match occurred two 
weeks ago at Bethany College. Using the new 
line-up, the team won a 9-0 sweep. Mills, 
Tuxen, Watkins, Amin, Cook, Fedorowich, 
and Balch all contributed to the victory.
The next match was at Seton Hill where 
the team dominated another opponent 
en route to a 9-0 victory.
Although the team was chal
lenged by their next opponent,
Grove City, the team still 
prevailed 6-3.
The final two matches oc
curred at Frostburg College 
in West Virginia. The team 
played Frostburg and Juniata Colleges. Again 
the team performed well by winning both 
matches convincingly.
With such an impressive start, Huang said 
that this could be contending team in the 
UAA. We put last season behind us and we 
are prepared for a new season. This is a close 
team and will be able to challenge any oppo
nent we play. Huang also felt that the teams 
overall strength will play a factor for a success
ful season.
Ryan Rhoads/
Tartan Art Staff
Amin agreed and stated that other 
teams will look at CMU as more of a 
challenge. Amin also said that there have 
been a lot of positive changes for this 
years team. We are more structured and 
organized in our practices and schedules. 
The practices have a team atmosphere 
[rather than an] individual one.
The mens first match also occurred at 
Frostburg where they won 9-0. The team 
lost three seniors from last year, so 
many younger players from last 
year have had to step up. The 
top players for the mens team 
are sophomores Navroze 
S Marshall, James Freese, and 
Dan Bilco, freshman Amit 
Jaipuria, junior Vijay Nayak, 
and senior Brandon Lai.
* Number two seed Marshall 
felt that this team could be a 
contending team if things are 
done right. Its bad to lose se
niors but well step up. Our 
first match wasnt a good 
judgment on our teams abil
ity, but were getting there. 
Marshall said that the fall 
season will give good preparation 
for the team. Well play in a few big 
tournaments so we will get an 
idea for what the opponents are 
like in the spring. Based on last 
seasons impressive record, Marshall felt 
that this years team has a good target and 
could perhaps be better than last year.
The mens team next plays this Thurs
day at home against Allegheny College. 
The match continues a rivalry between 
the two teams in which CMU has lost the 
two previous close matches. The women 
play this evening against Westminster 
College. Huang said that Westminster is a 
strong team and should be an interesting 
opponent for CMU.

12The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  11 September 1995The new Iron HorseCal Ripken Jr. breaks 56-year-old record
By ANGELA MOLLOY
Tartan Staffwriter
There are few unselfish people left in baseball. Whether we watch 
them on (TV or go to the ballpark, money, owners, deals, free agency, 
and the debate over the designated hitter take precedence over 
character. What we have lost is the game itself: The all-American 
sport. There was a time when players were regular guys who 
were farmers in the off-season, and kids could hang out in the 
player parking lot and get advice about their swing. Cal Ripken 
Jr., the Baltimore Orioles shortstop who made baseball history 
last Wednesday, symbolizes what the game is all about, and 
gives new hope to a country whose thoughts of baseball are no 
longer optimistic.
Any kid who grew up in Maryland was an Orioles fan, and 
every kid knew who Cal was. His father was an Oriole before 
him, and his brother was playing second base with him. Ripken 
began his consecutive games streak in March of1982 and since 
then has barely missed an inning. After 13 years of play, Ripken 
played game number 2,131 on September 6, breaking the 2,130 
game record held by the Hall of Fame first baseman Lou Gehrig, 
who retired from the game in 1939.
Arriving at Camden Yards on Wednesday was surreal. Three 
hours before game time the parking lots were full. Driving down 
Russell street to approach the Yard, men and women, fathers, 
sons, and daughters held signs that said, need one ticket, this 
is my dream, drove all night, came in from Chicago, please 
sell me a ticket. Inside the park, young boys and girls stood at 
the left field wall trying to get autographs while the Orioles, 
including Cal, took batting practice. This was not your typical 
baseball game. On the third-base line next to the opposing
pitcher in the majors, Mike Mussina, was starting, and a rookie was 
playing left field in Brady Andersons usual domain, our thoughts 
were with Cal and we got more out of him then we expected. In the 
fourth inning on a 3-0 count, Ripken blew one into left field for 
another home run. Still our eyes were on the warehouse wall. A 
baseball game is official once it hits the middle of the fifth inning, and 
thats when Ripken would become a legend.
Angela Molloy/Tartan Staffwriter 
Fans enter the stadium early to see Cal Ripken Jr.'s 2131st consecutive game.
teams dugout, 260 seats worth $5,000 each were placed right on the
dugout again and again onto the field by his teammates, Ripken 
waved to the crowd in appreciation. Home Team Sports coverage for 
the monitors in the seats showed Ripken mouthing the words no 
more, no more. The cheering would last 22 minutes, 15 seconds (said 
the Washington Post the next day) and the emotion would only 
escalate as Ripken took a lap around the field to shake hands with 
the fans.
This game was not about numbers, it was not about going to 
Cooperstown. It was about a man who plays baseball because 
he loves the game. Ripken is not a showman, he is not putting 
up a front. He was raised in Maryland and dreamed of playing 
for his home team, which he always has. He has a wife and two 
children whom he loves dearly. He signs autographs after 
games until his hand hurts while other players have gone home.
The streak has had its critics. Ripken shouldnt be putting 
his personal goals ahead of his teams goals, some of my friends 
have said. But think about it. Hes out there every day for the 
team. Hes one of nine on the field, and the team has to work 
together to win the game. Ripken doesnt stay on the bench 
when he doesnt feel 100 percent, hes out there so his team 
knows they can count on him. Ripken is also such a skilled and 
calculated player that he has not been seriously injured since he 
started playing. Hes been an All-Star and an MVP numerous 
times.
In post-game ceremonies, Ripken thanked his parents for 
inspiring him and supporting him. He thanked his fans and his 
wife. But the fans at Camden on Wednesday were really 
thanking Cal for being who he is and showing up for work every 
day to play the game he loves. He made us feel like close friends 
and we were privileged to be able to share such a moment with 
him. Baseball needed Ripken right now to bring us back and
grass. Secret Service lined the roof in preparation for the arrival of spotlight shone on the wall, sparklers were set off from the top of the

On the Angels third out in the top of the fifth, the crowd roared. A renew our faith. The strike, with its arrogant players and owners,
showed how baseball is no longer a game, but a vicious industry.
The show of affection for Ripken through the streak and his 
modesty have made the game special again and brought it back into 
our hearts. History was made Wednesday and perhaps it will inspire 
us all to go out there every day and keep doing what we love.Tartans split pair last week

Things looked bad for CMU in 
the last two minutes of play. On a

broke the offensive strike, but 
| the ball rolled free toward the 
open goal. Freshman back Tracy 
Burton, who had played strong 
defense all game, caught the ball 
in time and blasted it out of 
bounds. But in the final seconds 
of the period, CWRU brought the 
ball back into play with a shot 
that landed in a crowd of players 
in front of the goal and dribbled 
in for the first and only goal of the 
game. Time expired soon there
after.
When asked about the teams 
overall performance, Coach Ann
Haggerty said, We played well 
at times. It took us a while to get 
going, however, and we... lost our 
concentration in the end. But 
she also said, Overall, we showed 
big improvements defensively.

Outreach director 
fights inequality
BY LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Education, not anger, is what motivates Elaine Atkinson 
to fight racism, discrimination, and ignorance  three 
words that she said are crippling this nation in its struggle 
for cultural equality.
I feel as though my job  what I do  is to break down 
barriers, destroy stereotypes, and teach people to respect 
one another, said Atkinson, the director of Community 
Outreach. This is what Im supposed to do. I didnt used to 
know that. I grew into it.
Atkinson, who began her Carnegie Mellon career as an 
assistant to Herb Simon in 1984, jumped into a leadership 
position five years ago when she founded Role Models, a 
program which puts positive images into the lives of AfricanAmerican elementary school children. The program aims to 
give children the knowledge and skills to pursue bright 
futures.
Atkinson said the program was specifically designed to 
put children and college students together so that AfricanAmerican children could see older African-Americans aspir
ing for careers.
In addition to Hole Models, Atkinson instructs for East 
End Tutoring, a program which pairs college students with 
elementary children for academic and personal support.
She works with teenage mothers at the Hill House, a 
settlement house in the Hill district.
She also helps students deal with racial struggles at 
Allderdice High School.
She gives talks to male African-Americans with criminal 
records so they may be motivated to help themselves.
Somehow, all of us have to be agents of change, said 
Atkinson simply. We cant afford to sit passively by any 
longer.
Atkinson, who grew up with the voices of Martin Luther 
King, Jr., Malcolm X, and the Black Panthers, does not sit 
passively by.
Racism is based on fearfear that you might change who 
you are; that you might lose power, she said. When we 
begin to understand the struggles of different peoples  
famine, war, the Holocaust  what we begin to realize is 
that the human spirit is beautiful, and very strong.
Atkinsons office in the Student Center is a myriad of 
paperwork. Bulletins about lectures and workshops are 
posted around her desk. Grant proposals in various stages of 
completion are piled neatly on top of a row of books. The 
phone rings every couple of minutes. Visitors knock frePlease see ATKINSON, page L3

Its not outright, but its there. People

cause, personally, I think that they have 
more spirit  theyre louder and stuff, she 
said.
More often than not, students find that 
CMU does not foster the diverse atmosphere 
that is so often considered one of the schools 
biggest assets.
There arent many opportunities for in
termingling, said Tasha Carter, a senior 
chemical engineering major. But at the 
same time, I dont think that the students 
here are really interested in intermingling. 
To get through this school, everyone needs 
to find their own group, a niche. And once 
they find that, theres no reason to branch 
out, she said.
In order to help minorities find that niche, 
organizations lik the Asian Students Asso
ciation, the Korean Students Association, 
Mayur, Society of Hispanic Engineers, 
Spirit, and programs such as CMAP serve 
as the sole social outlet for these students.
People in these programs dont integrate 
themselves into the campus well. For ex
ample, CMAP singles out minorities as be
ing special or different in some way, Pitkin 
said.
Because they cultivate isolated factions 
on campus, some> students feel that such 
groups should not! be funded by the school. 
I dont think that we should have to sup
port minority organizations on this cam
pus, whether it be the ASA, Spirit, or the 
Womens Center, said Christopher Ravin, 
ajunior biology major.
Not all share in his opinion. Senior art 
major Christopher Craychee believes that 
minority organizations on campus help race 
relations and are a necessary part of cam
pus life.
Its a group of people with something in 
common. Race and culture define how you 
see others and how you see yourself in 
relation to others, he said.
Craychee also believes that if CMU is 
segregated, it is the fault of both sides, not 
just minorities.
You have to go out of your way to have a 
meaningful relationship with someone of 
another race, he said.

"I have two overriding thoughts; I 1 
worry a good bit about how we are in ! 
the area of promoting and using racial ; 
diversity. For example, while we have 
a way to go, we have made a lot more - 
strides in the undergraduate level than ! 
we have in faculty hiring. Second, from 1 
my selfish perspective, I'm glad that J 
we've avoided massive politicization  
over racial issues, but I wonder some- . 
times if we're not a little bit too quiet 
for our own good."i

"I don't think this has anything to do 1 
with calculated racism. It's presented 1 
as a financial matter. The administration tells departments, 'Yes, we're will- q 
ing to support this faculty for several  
years if you can fund them.'After sev- fI 
eral years, the department has to find 
a way to fund these people, which can 4 
be challenging. The English depart

secure in this situation." e

"Race relations on this campus are no 1 
doubt similar in many ways to race , 
relations anywhere. However, poor 
relations are, inlarge part, a product of 
ignorance or insecurity. I believe these

Jokes trivialize womens struggle
Cracking the Myth
by Amber Benezra
Recently, someone I know told me this 
joke, assuming I would think it was 
funny.
Here are some things overheard at 
the womens conference in China:
Hey Reno, you left the seat up again. 
Dont shove... youll all get a chance to 
slap Bob Packwood.
Are the men gone? OK, bring out the 
Tupperware!!
Tou used to date Martina? I used to 
date Martina.
Whats Richard Simmons doing here? 
Needless to say, I did not think this 
was funny at all.
Unfortunately, many people share this 
viewpointthat a conference on women 
implies psychotic militant feminists who 
are obviously all lesbians and want to 
" kill all men.
This perspective trivializes the impor, tance of the conference, as well as the 
, importance of international womens 
rights.
The whole, Ha ha look at those zany 
women, attitude is demeaning and an
noying, and attempts to invalidate the 
real goals of the conference.
The Fourth World Conference on 
Women, the largest and most important 
forum on women in ten years, began 
September 4, in Beijing.
The proposed issues included every
thing from contraception and abortion, 
to human rights and institutionalized 
rape.
The objective was to bring political, 
social, and economic equality for women 
to the forefront of governmental agen
das. Delegates to the conference wrote a
Platform of Action to define future plans 
for feminism, womens rights and social 
change.
The document tries to remove ob
stacles to womens participation in pri
vate and public life, ensure a full and 
equal share in economic, social and po
litical decision-making and affirm that 
the human rights of women are an inte
gral part of universal human rights, 
said Gertrude Mongella, secretary gen
eral of the conference.
Although it is expected that many 
Islamic countries, as well as the Vatican, 
would come out in opposition of many of 
the tenets of the conference, the struggle 
for womens rights is being countered by 
many American groups as well.
The major concern of men from Saudi 
Arabia to the U.S. is that such advance
ments for women are endangering the 
structure and moral fiber of the family.
Logically, this makes no sense, be
cause the stronger women become, so
cially, politically, and economically, the 
better they will be able to support their 
families.
James Dobson, the president of the 
Colorado-based Focus on the Family, 
seems to disagree.
He and other conservative critics say 
the conference is an assemblage of ultra-liberal feminists who threaten their 
view of family values.
They also suspect that the real agenda 
is radical gender-feminism.
Dobsons sentiment was paralleled by 
Saudi Arabias highest religious author
ity who remarked that the conferences 
platform, seeks the destruction of the 
family and allows the unrestrained prac
tice of adultery and other immoral acts.
It seems to me that these men are 
very, very afraid of women breaking free 
of patriarchal rule.
Opponents of the Fourth World Con
ference on Women are opponents of 
womens rights.
They try to appeal to womens sense of 
familial duty, and claim that morality 
and values are in danger when women 
start demanding certain things for them
selves, and for their daughters.
These traditional family values are 
often used by governments to keep 
women restricted to the domestic sphere. 
In recent years, the social and economic 
advancement of women has been re
versed due to a return to conservatism 
and the forcing of women back into their 
special role.
According to a global report by Human 
Rights Watch, Some governments, 
among them Iran, the Holy See, India, 
Guatemala and Egypt, have threatened 
to roll back the gains for womens rights 
negotiated at previous conferences on 
human rights, population, and human 
development.
These governments promote the con
cept that women have a special role in 
society and the family as an excuse to 
deny women their equality, civil liber
ties, and right to be free from violence.
This is infuriating to me, because ev
ery modicum of social progress achieved 
by women is immediately counteracted.
Fear seems to be the great motivator; 
if women are not limited by violence, 
economic oppression, and domestic re
sponsibilities, who knows what they 
might do?
In all, the Fourth World Conference 
on Women is being attacked as well as 
dismissed by international religious 
leaders, groups focused on the family, 
and conservative rivals (not to mention 
the trouble the Chinese government is 
causing).
Jokes made about the conference may 
not be malevolent, but they trivialize 
womens struggle, and ultimately affect 
the way people think about gender equal
ity.
As Naomi Weisstein so powerfully put 
it, When we hear jokes against women, 
and we are asked why we dont laugh at 
them, the answer is easy, simple, and 
short:
Of course were not laughing, you ass. 
Nobody laughs at the sight of their own 
blood.

Assembling your own system saves money
Focused on the Internet
by Kenton Shaver
Right now we are just leaving the 
golden age of computing. How do I 
conclude this? Doom sound cues.
The expansion of the user computer 
interface will not be as abrupt as the 
move from silent films to talkies was 
(I hope), but the change follows the 
same pattern: telegraph to telephone, 
silent film to talkie, ASCII email to
it is best to know the system down to 
the component level.
Which leads us to the URL of the 
week: http://techweb.cmp.com/techweb/programs/twgo. Up until quite re
cently, a feature series called Build
ing Your Own Systems was provided 
on-line that detailed the considerations 
computer retailer houses must make 
when assembling their own systems.
Readers who want to see this article 
are encouraged to write the magazine 
and encourage them to form an archive 
page, (http ://tech web. cmp. com/scripts/ 
imagemap/toolbar?430,59).
Some resellers, afraid of doing jail 
time for selling non-FCC compliant 
systems, buy stripped-down FCC-certified systems containing a mother
board and a power supply only.
The odds of getting caught by the FCC and 
jailed for selling computers with noncomplicant emissions charteristics are slim...
Mime. And video games dependent on 
sound cues.
For a deaf guy on this campus, only 
a crude facsimile of a life is possible, 
unless, of course, that life is lived in 
large part through a PC. Then, with 
the right software and hardware, the 
facsimile can be printed in 600 dpi 
resolution! So lets begin to explore 
this.
Key question: Can you save money 
assembling your own system? The 
comp, sys.ibm.pc.hardware. systems 
consensus seems now to be assembled. 
Whats cheaperbuild or buy clone. 
That may or may not be the case.
It can be an expensive proposition to 
buy a nonstandard machine, or to 
forgo the bundled programs. And, if 
you want to run Linux or Warp, then
The odds of getting caught by the 
FCC and jailed for selling computers 
with non-compliant emissions charac
teristics are slim but palpable. The 
FCC doesnt certify power supplies or 
motherboardsjust systems and pe
ripherals and add-in cards.
For your consideration, it may gut 
resale value if you are trying to get rid 
of an RF-hot system that kills your 
neighbors TV reception, not that much 
resale value ever existed anyway.
On this note, Focused on the 
Internets recommendation is not to 
be your own system integrator. Mar
gins from reputable clone makers are 
too thin to justify it.

Director fights racism
ATKINSON, from page LI paralyzed, have hurt many students
quently on her door. Sometimes I get perceptions of racial equality, Atkinson 
down-trodden with all the administra- said the city of Pittsburgh itself lies at 
tive tasks...  she said, motioning to her the heart of racial struggles, not Carnecluttered desk with 
a wry grin.
But the students 
and children renew 
my spirit. They keep 
me focused on my 
mission to bring 
people together.
Atkinson said the 
University is very 
receptive to improv
ing race relations 
and promoting cam
pus diversity.
When she pitched 
her Role Models 
idea to- the Univer
sity several years 
ago, President Mehrabian himself agreed 
this was something the school should be 
promoting.
While tragedies such as Javon 
Thompsons shooting last year and the 
recent drive-by shooting in front of
gie Mellon.
Pittsburgh is aw
ful  its like going 
back in time 50years. 
When things are 
hard here, it seems 
to be three or four 
times as hard on 
blacks... this city has 
a long way to go, she 
said, mentioning that 
Pittsburghs infant 
mortality rate has 
been compared' to 
those of Third World 
countries.
Recognizing prob
lems and finding so
lutions seem to be Atkinsons motiva
tion.

agent of change? Can I make every life I 
touch a little brighter? Everyday I won

Students perceive racial tension
RACE, from page LI
Sticking with the social structure 
of the campus, Ill say that I have black 
friends,butl cantsay that its through 
my fraternity, which is my main social 
outlet. Maybe I would be spending 
time with a more diverse range of 
people if I wasnt in a fraternity. People 
who say that the fraternities arent 
segregated are full of shit, but its an 
unconscious segregation; its no ones 
fault. Few blacks are interested in 
joining fraternities, possibly because 
there is no precedent of blacks [in 
fraternities] to begin with, he said.
While it may seem that the main 
social organizations on campus such 
as fraternities and sororities are pre
dominantly white, many relay this 
back to a reverse racism that exists at 
CMU. The issue isnt so much of blacks 
being part of a white organization, as 
it is an issue of these organizations 
closing themselves off from the rest of 
the black community on campus, said 
Rick Gilmore, a senior chemical engi
neering major.
That could be because were so few in 
number, he added.
When asked about racism on campus, 
Gilmore replied that it does exist. When 
I speak about racism, I speak as a hu
man being, not a black person, and I do 
feel that while there is a certain amount 
of prejudice here, it comes from within 
as well as from others, he said.
If there are ever racial tensions on this 
campus, it manifests itself tenfold dur
ing Carnival, mainly because of the an
nual Sweepstakes Competition.
The only time I am consciously aware 
of racism here is at buggy time, said 
Lynn Babyak, a junior biology major. 
The rest of the years racial isolation is 
just written off as a way to preserve 
culture, but at buggy those lines of sepa
ration begin to clash, she said.
Many students find that the positive 
aspects of such events fail to outweigh 
the racial conflicts which they are forced 
to experience, hence they refuse to par
ticipate.
 I was really into buggy until it got to 
be too much, said Gilmore. For what
ever reasons, it was Spirit against the 
Greeks and vice versa.
Racism does exist, said Andrew 
David Ortiz, a sophomore civil engit 
neering major. Maybe not in boldface 
letters or on water fountains. It may 
last only for seconds, but these sec
onds add up to a lifetime.
I see a lot of slander, he added. 
People just dont understand that 
their words take an effect on others  
ill will adds up over time.
CMU may just be representative of 
the real world, a racist world, that s 
unchanging on this campus, where 
responsibility always lies on others.
The world is racist, said Carter. 
But it shouldnt infringe upon on my 
education. One thing necessary for an 
education is a sense of belonging. TKe 
school doesnt foster a sense of belong
ing. They (the administration) want to 
weed people out.
Racial tensions wont go away, said 
Craychee. But can we prevent them 
from becoming more polar entities? 
Thats the question.

This [CMU] is just a micro
cosm of current race relations 
taking place in the rest of the 
world, said Frank Ligons, a jun
ior history policy maj or and presi
dent of Spirit. Its difficult to 
find a place where people dont 
react to race. I guess, in a way, 
that would be a utopia. Of course, 
there are degrees to which this 
narrow-mindedness takes place. 
I definitely think CMU leans to
wards the lower end of the [nar
row-mindedness] scale, he said.
Though CMU has an eclectic 
mix of students from diverse cul
tural and racial backgrounds, 
there is very little interaction 
among different groups.
However, with the number of 
cultural organizations forming on 
campus, a few students are striv
ing to bring together students of 
every ethnicity.
Cultural groups on campus in
clude, among others: ASA (Asian 
Student Association), KSA (Ko
rean Students Organization), 
SHIPE (Society of Hispanic En
gineers), Mayur (which celebrates 
Indian culture), Spirit (which fo
cuses on African-American cul
ture), and the Muslim Students 
Association.
CMU students have also cre
ated the Pakistan Students As
sociation, theTaiwanese Organi
zation, the Vietnamese Student 
Organization, and SPIC MACAY 
(Society for the Promotion of In
dian Classical Music and Cul
ture Amongst Youth).
Unfortunately, many students 
misperceive the purpose of the 
cultural organizations that exist 
at CMU.
Jessica Fang, a senior psychol
ogy and IM major, who is presi
dent of the Asian Student Asso
ciation said, I know one of the 
biggest problems students have
in perceiving ASAis that they see 
it as a clique. Students dont un
derstand that we are open to any
one who is interested in Asian 
culture. I can understand how 
some may find it odd to join if 
they are non-Asian, she said.
Spirit is also open to students 
of every race. Ligons said, Spirit 
welcomes students of every 
ethnicity. We have a diverse ra
cial makeup. Its unfortunate that 
these groups are looked upon as 
being closed cliques. Our aim is 
to incorporate different people. 
We believe in the notion of 
strength through diversity. Spirit 
encourages people of different 
backgrounds to get involved. We 
believe we can learn from each 
other. A racial clique is not what 
we strive for.
The main focus of Spirit is to 
promote African-American cul
tural awareness. In conjunction 
with that, we strive for positive 
gains for blacks and other mi|{ INCI I> I. li S of SOUND R K T I R K M K X T I X V K S T I X G

IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START 
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS 
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.
Cant afford to save for retirement?
The truth is, you cant afford not to. 
Not when you realize that your retirement 
can last 20 to 3o years or more. Youll want 
to live at least as comfortably then as you 
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take 
advantage of tax deferral and give your 
money time to compound and grow. 
Consider this: Set aside just $100 each 
month beginning at age 3o and you can 
accumulate over $172,109* by the time 
you reach age GS. But wait ten years and 
youll have to budget $219 each month 
to reach the same goal.
Even if youre not counting the years to 
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF 
to help you build the future you deservewith flexible retirement and tax-deferred 
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest
ment choices, and a record of personal 
service that spans y5 years.
Over 1.7 million people in education and 
research put TIAA-CREF at the top of 
their list for retirement planning. Why not 
join them?

norities on and off campus 
through political, social, and cul
tural programs, said Ligons.
These groups as well as a vari
ety of others that exist at CMU 
take an important part in creat
ing cultural awareness. They do 
this through a number of activi
ties.
When ASA started out, it basi
cally concentrated on social func
tions. Last year, I decided it 
should not just be social. Our 
meetings now focus on discus
sion groups on such topics as in
terracial dating and inter-gen
erational conflicts. We have got
ten positive feedback from these 
groups, said Fang.
Our meetings are open to ev
eryone, and they are advertised
throughout campus and on our 
electronic bulletin board. This 
semester, we want to do activi
ties with other organizations such 
as Mayur and Spirit. We also will 
be participating in the Interna
tional Festival, said Fang.
Spirit is also very active in the 
campus and Pittsburgh commu
nities, as its members partici
pate in community projects, fash
ion shows, Black History Month 
programs, community outreach 
programs, and speaking at 
schools.
It also plans a number of social 
functions throughout the year. It 
is evident that CMU is made up 
of students with contrasting cul
tures, ethnicities, religions, be
liefs, and opinions.
Though this may in fact create 
racial tension throughout .our 
community, perhaps utilizing 
these cultural organizations can 
be the first step toward finding 
some sort of harmony.
Ligons said, Maybe one day a 
rejuvenation of the peace -and 
hope of the 60s will occur. People 
have come into situations and 
turned around full circle, bu Im 
not so sure that there ever will be 
a magical solution. As intermix
ing of races continues, this sort of 
hatred and narrow-mindedness 
may end. Its inevitable in a way, 
though humans will find another 
way to differentiate. Its in pur 
nature. We do need to bridge tnese 
gaps because there certainly is 
room for improvement.

Hairy CMU students lighten, brighten, dred
By DAWN WALLHAUSEN
Tartan Staffwriter
One night last spring semes
ter, I was hanging out in Shirley 
Apartments when my friend 
Kris Peterson (junior, history) 
decided that he wanted a new 
hairstyle. A D. C. punk type, Kris 
thought that liberty spikes 
would be the perfect statement.
Well, I had previously helped 
an ex-boyfriend give himself the 
same kind of do, so I figured I 
could do it again, right? I mean, 
all it took was some Elmers 
glue, some egg whites, and a 
touch of gel. I thought, How 
hard could this be?
But my exs hair had been de
ceptively easy to work with.
What little hair he had left in 
the middle of his head was barely 
12 inches long, wiry, and pur
posefully a bit on the greasy 
side.
Kris, on the other hand, 
sported at least two feet of ul
tra-fine, ultra-smooth hair. The task at 
hand was going to be a bit more difficult 
than I had expected.
Well, I tried it anyway. I got the neces
sary equipment and started in on the job. 
I must have had every person in Shirley 
Apartments who was still awake at the 
time supporting one of the spikes Id made 
in the hopes that theyd hold when they 
dried. No such luck.
When all the usual ingredients failed 
me, I broke out a can of impossible-tomove-permanent-holdhairspray and some 
rubber cement. I was tempted to try using 
some of the pistachio pudding in Kriss 
fridge as a fixative, but he wouldnt let me.
The end result of this little adventure 
was that poor Kris had three or four differ
ent hair products, two or three different 
varieties of paste-boogers, and various food 
items on his head  and still no liberty 
spikes to show for it. Maybe if wed been 
more patient about letting all the gunk dry 
... but everyones arms were getting tired.
As you might guess, most people with 
truly funky hair either do it themselves or 
do like Kris did and ask a friend for help in 
getting it. Not too many Pittsburgh salons 
specialize in purple mohawks or whiteblonde buzzes. That kind of style isnt for 
your average member of the Philip Pelusi 
clientele.
Besides, who wants to pay $12 for a 
simple head-shaving if youve got a pal 
with clippers and all the attachments?
Case in point: Ryan Douglass (junior, 
art). Ryan does all the upkeep on his cur
rently blue-green mohawk himself. He
Chris White applies dye to friend Curtis Jacksons hair. Just an hour later, the dreds were bouncing, blonde, and beautiful.
mixes all of his own bleach, as well as 
doing all of the shaving and trimming on 
his own. The green used in his present 
color is Manic Panic, which can be bought 
at places like Slackers on the South Side 
for a minimal fee.
Douglass got the blueish tone from a 
dye called Punky Color. He said that 
Punky Color, which he bought in Wash
ington D.C., is similar to Manic Panic, 
except that it sticks to the hair better.
As for the cut, Douglass just needs to 
shave off whatever hair he doesnt want 
and occasionally trim the hair he keeps.
Imagine your hair being human and smoking a lot of 
pot. It just happens that way. 
 Hafeez Raji, senior design major
He says that, although he changes his 
color every month or so, he doesnt often 
alter the mohawk. When he wants to 
change the shape of his hair, he just uses 
some hairspray and makes spikes.
Of course, if you go for a do like Hafeez 
Rajis (senior, design), you dont need to 
worry about clippers at all. Raji has what 
can best be called modified dredlocks, 
and he never has to cut them. In fact, he 
doesnt need to wash them, either. They 
require minimal upkeep.
Raji describes the process of getting hair 
like his by saying, Imagine your hair 
being human and smoking a lot of pot. It 
just happens that way. He goes on to 
explain that he got tired of all the care that
with my complexion, he said. 
His hair is now naturally dark 
brown.
As for Darby, White convinced 
him to change his natural hair 
color because, I like to see black 
guys with blonde hair, he said. 
Darby then added that Jackson 
ended up joining them because 
he was, jumping on the band
wagon. Jackson denied this by 
saying that hed actually done it 
to enhance [his] beauty.
The whole dying process took 
a fair amount of time. Jackson 
left the dye on his hair for about 
an hour, while Darby and White 
left it on for about 20 minutes
Born Blonde is only really 
meant to be left in for twenty 
minutes, but Jackson was happy 
the way it looked after an 
, and it hadnt burned his 
hair, so he washed it out.
Dyeing with regular Clairoltype colors is one of those great 
things that you can do if you 
want a change, but nothing too drastic.
You can go blonde or black or auburn, 
and perhaps youll surprise your friends 
and family, but you wont actually offend 
anyone. You just put the stuff in (although 
sometimes you need to strip the old color 
first), wait, and rinse.
Manic Panic and similar dyes tend to be 
more technicolor shocking, but easier to 
use. Often, you can use them right on dry 
hair and only, need rinse them. Unfortu
nately, if you choose fuchsia as your new 
haircolor, prepare for a potentially hostile 
job maket, as well as a rather unaccepting 
general public.
The same is true for some hairstyles, as 
well. Raji, who intends to keep his dreds 
after graduation, admitted it might be
come a problem when looking for a job. 
However, he also said that some [design] 
firms are more open-minded than others, 
and thats th kind of place Id want to 
work for anyway.
Douglass has few fears about finding 
acceptance for his hairstyle choice in the 
art world. He said, I worked for the Arts 
Festival this summer, and they didnt even 
make me take out any of my piercings. 
Douglass has, however, been hassled by 
the average citizen. Pittsburgh is bad for 
that, he said.
ior, civil engineering)  were all going Of the three freshly-dyed men, White 
blonde. The three bought a package of will keep dying his hair blonde without 
Born Blonde at the local Revco and, well, fear. Jackson said that he would continue
went into maintaining his previous style, 
so he quit combing it, let it grow naturally, 
and just started twisting it until it got a bit 
curly and, in his words, kind of nappy.
Note that Raji, unlike most people with 
dredlocks, never put any honey, mud, or 
any of the other typical organic substances 
used for such hairstyles in his hair. How
ever, like others with a similar style, he 
avoids getting it wet because it looks like 
a mop, when that happens.
Curtis Jackson (physics major) has 
dredlocks like Rajis, only somewhat more 
traditional.
He used honey in his, and it took about 
three and a half hours to get them all in.
It may have taken him more work to get 
his, but Jacksons dreds are a bit more 
permanent than Rajis. They can be washed 
or gotten wet without fear. They go back to 
their original shape.
When last I spoke with him, Jackson and 
two of his friends  Adam Darby (senior, 
technical writing) and Chris White (junwent blonde.
When asked why they chose to dye their 
hair, White said that he does it regularly 
anyway. I was bom blonde. It looks better
dying his as well, and he didnt seem con
cerned with whether or not the color or his 
dreds would be accepted. Darby wants to 
try green next time.

Comic guru finds new treat
Comic Book Chronicles
by Jason Andracki
If Ive only learned one thing 
from my father, its to never turn
on the first two issues, and 
Roberto Corona on the third and 
fourth installments.
To sum up the plot in a combi
nation of four movies: Flatliners, 
Stargate, The Ten Command
ments, and Im sorry to say it, 
Reality Bites. So this means it 
involves near death experiences, 
pseudo-intellectual slackers, and 
warping to Egypt.
Im not that familiar with 
Milligans work but Im sure 
Egypt is some of his best writing.
in the book, although the pro
tagonist, Vincent, is getting less 
despicable. The dialogue is very 
sharp and definitely earns the 
Mature Readers warning. The 
slacker college kids are extremely 
shallow; so shallow that it seems 
like Milligan did research at my 
high school for them. Although I 
usually have a hard time liking 
something about people I hate, 
for some reason it doesnt bother
The only thing that could make
free movies, free Mumia, and best 
of all, free comics. DC comics was 
kind enough to send me a pre| view of a new mini-series from 
their Vertigo imprint, Egypt.
Egypt is one of those books Id 
page through, think about buy
ing but be frugal. Now that DC 
^-sent me a four-page preview, I 
-read that and decided to return 
the favor by buying the real book. 
Good choice.
Regretfully, the series is half
paperback later. Theyre both 
about the same price.

About a year ago, I got to review Ben Harpers 
phenomenal debut, Welcome to the Real World.
I was really impressed by his slidework, his 
bluesy roots, and his lyrical stabs at racism* 
oppression, and general evil in the world.
Who: Ben Harper 
What: Fight For Your Mind 
Label: EMI Virgin Records
His passion mirrors that of Tracy Chapmans, 
and his loose style parallels that of Edie Brickell 
and the New Bohemians. Well, having heard 
| this years release, Fight For Your Mind, I can 
I say this: Ben Harpers back, 
i and hes learned a few new 
tricks.
The album opens with Op
pression, a folky blues song 
in which Harper refers to op
pression as an entity, and lets 
; it know that he isnt going to 
let it affect him in any way.
This tune is average Ben
Harper fare; slidey finger-  ig95 EMj Virgin Records
picked rhythms over a nice, tight drum 
loop.
But in the segue between Oppression and 
the second track, Ground on Down, Harper 
reveals the extra trick on this album: the elec
tric guitar. Ground on Down (Youre working 
| your way/From the ground on down) is four 
minutes and 52 seconds of the most aggresi sively laid-back music youll ever hear, creating 
; such a dramatically oxymoronic balance that 
the listener is completely moved. I found it
impossible to stay put in my chair as the album 
rocked on. These two extremes are then deftly 
balanced for the rest of the album, which ends 
with One Road to Freedom, a lighter-waving 
finale that rocks the listeners gently to peace.
His lyrical strength is definitely intact, as is 
shown throughout the disc. Whether he bluntly 
expresses his need to not just be a friend to the 
woman he loves in Please Me Like You Want 
To, (Dont do me any favors/matter of fact why 
dont you do yourself a few) or gives a stirring 
middle finger to the disgracefully pompous men 
in society who take the respect of adulthood but 
dont deserve it in Excuse Me Mr. (Excuse me 
Mr./Do you have the time/or are you so impor
tant/ that it stands still for you), his delivery is 
superb and heartfelt.
His musicianship has 
tightened up a bitthe slips 
and slides that listeners fa
miliarized themselves with a 
year ago arent absent, but 
they dont dominate as often 
as they did on the last record.
This album makes for a tre
mendous follow-up to his de
but, completely avoiding the 
infamous Sophomore Slump 
that so many of the best re
cording artists fare poorly against. Its another 
killer blend of blues, bluegrass, folk, gospel, and 
soul that thrills its audience from start to finish. 
Ive always thought that its not bad to get more 
of a good thing, and Harper seems to be very 
willing to give it to his audience, with enhance
ments along the way. I give this a heavy recom
mendation to anyone who checks out coffee
house music, and to anyone who listens to WYEP 
on a regular basis.

A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y. 
These women now have their own 
movement. Im referring to the 
recent release of the self-titled 
album Vowel Movement.
Who: Holly Vincent and Johnette Napolitano 
What: Vowel Movement 
Label: Mammoth Records
Vowel Movement con
sists of Johnette Nap
olitano, who some of you 
may remember as the 
lead singer for the band 
Concrete Blonde, and 
Holly Vincent, who in the 
early 80s gained popu
larity with Holly and the 
Italians, but has more 
recently been fronting the 
band The Oblivious.
Both women, friends 
from way back at the be
ginning of their careers 
when they both worked 
as waitresses in the same 
restaurant, decided to be 
spontaneous at a show 
where The Oblivious was 
opening for Concrete Blonde.
The women donned huge plati
num wigs and did a happy birth
day tribute to their road man
ager as Vowel Movement. The 
idea was so well received that the 
girls headed for the studio.
Six amazing days later they 
emerged with an album. Yes, I 
said six. They didnt stop for 
things like lyrics or riffs. They 
just went to the studio and had 
about 14 jam sessions. I think 
they did pretty well.
The album starts off with Di
nosaur to which there is a video
which is something that I person- where else.
ing. Dont let this deter you, 
though. What these women ac
complished in six days would take 
most bands six months to do. The 
sixth track on the album, Las 
Vegas starts off with the sounds 
of a handful of coins rolling across 
a tabletop, something that you 
definitely would not find someally think would be interesting to 
watch.
The album has a few glaring 
errors on it, and paging through
 Mammoth Records 
the publicity layout, I found out 
why.
Vowel Movement only did about 
five re-takes on the entire 14- 
track album. There are spots on 
the album where you can hear 
one or both of the women laugh- or otherwise.
Other memorable tracks in
clude Death of a Surfer, a song 
that features Napolitano doing a 
spoken word with Vincent in the 
background playing the 
bass. Jesus, which is an 
upbeat song, reminded me 
of such power groups as 
the Ramones. The one 
thing that really confused 
me about the album was 
the fact that tracks 10 and 
14 had the same name. I 
found that there was a 
really simple explanation 
for that: theyre the same 
song. The tracks are called 
Jackie Baby, and al
though there are minor 
differences between the 
two, the song is done well 
enough to listen to twice.
With no basis for com
parison since this is the 
groups first album, Id have to 
say that the nonsensical guitar 
riffs combined with dreamy vo
cals that are just slightly above 
mumbling, make this an incred
ibly enjoyable movement, vowel
Desperado delights critic
By APRIL C. MOATE
'Tartan Staffwriter
Written, produced, and directed 
by Robert Rodriguez, Desperado 
is a sequel to Rodriguezs highly 
jacclaimed El Mariachi. It stars 
Antonio Banderas (The Mambo 
'gs, Interview with the Vam
pire) as El Mariachi himself, a 
Mexican guitar player who is on a 
mission to avenge the murder of 
his lover.
hat: Desperado 
irector: Robert Rodriguez
j The mariachi is looking for a 
man named Bucho, who is re
sponsible for her death. Banderas 
sidekick/right-hand man is 
played by Steve Buscemi.
| (Quentin Tarantino fans will re
member him as Mr. Pink from 
:Reservoir Dogs.) Tarantino him
self makes a cameo appearance 
before he, and just about every
one else in the movie is blown 
away in one of the many ultraviolent shoot-outs, all spawned 
somehow by the mariachi, that 
take place in a small Mexican 
town.
The movie opens with Buscemi 
entering a dusty, seedy-looking 
bar and telling a story of the 
----Mexican hes ever
seen, who came into another bar 
with a guitar case full of guns, 
looking for a man named Bucho, 
and didnt stop firing until he got 
the information he wanted. The 
story is a ploy to get the barmder, played by Cheech Marin,
or anyone else in the place to clue 
them in to Buchos whereabouts. 
Along the path to finding Bucho, 
the mariachi finds himself on a 
rampage, blowing away anyone 
who interferes with his quest. He 
also finds (of course) a beautiful 
woman, who helps him out and 
also gives the movie basis for a 
steamy love scene.
If you havent seen El Mariachi 
yet, dont worry. Desperado 
stands on its own, and you wont 
be left clueless about the events 
that lead up to the mariachis 
quest for vengeance. If asked for 
a short opinion about Desperado, 
I would simply tell you to run, 
dont walk to see this movie.
This film is so over-the-top that 
Robert Rodriguz is on his way to 
being grouped into the overnight 
success director category that is 
changing the movie industry. As 
of now, probably the only other 
director who can be placed into 
this category is Quentin Tar
antino.
While some of the action se
quences are a bit exaggerated, 
they all work, and Rodriguez 
takes this movie to a level that 
few action and suspense movies 
are ever able to achieve. The cam
era work is bold, and the music 
(performed by Los Lobos) height
ens the drama of all of the action 
in a seductive way.
The dialogue, while not always 
incredibly original, is candid and 
intriguing. The story told by 
Tarantinos character only adds 
more flavor and will keep you 
chuckling for days.
As if all of this was not enough, 
Rodriguez threw in Banderas, 
who can make even a bad movie 
worth watching. As the mariachi, 
he proves himself to be more than 
just.a sensuous Latin-lover type. 
Granted, his piercing eyes and 
sensuous lips (not to mention his 
sexy Spanish accent) are enough 
to make any woman weak in the 
knees.
His character is at times dark 
and menacing, but in the pres
ence of his lover seems vulner
able and boyish. His intense stare 
alone strikes some level of fear 
into each man who tries to get in 
his way.
Everything about the movie fits 
together like a puzzle. As long as 
you arent weak at heart and can 
handle a little (actually, a lot) of 
blood and guts, I challenge you to 
watch this movie and not enjoy it, 
as a guilty pleasure or as a vic
tory of originality in an often blas 
medium.
Oblivion unleashes talent
By ANDREW McDERMOTT
Tartan Acting Photo Editor
People always say that expe
rience is the best source to draw 
from for creative inspiration, 
and this has proven true for 
director Tom DiCillo. For along 
time, DiCillo attempted to get 
funding for his second movie, 
Moonshine in a Box.
What: Living in Oblivion 
Director: Tom DiCillo
He met with failure after fail
ure to generate more interest 
in his current project, and his 
frustration mounted until he 
started the project that became 
Living in Oblivion.
Initially a half-hour short he 
hoped to show at film festivals, 
Living in Oblivion evolvedinto 
a full length feature when he 
could not get the short entered 
in a festival. The rest of the 
picture was filmed later by 
DiCillo and the same crew, with 
the hopes of getting more exposure with a feature length film. 
The movie consists of two dreams 
plus the actual day of shooting at 
the set of a small movie called 
Living in Oblivion. The first 
dream is the directors, the sec
ond the lead actresss.
In the first dream, the director, 
played by Steve Buscemi, suffers 
setbacks of every type imagin
able as he pursues what seems to 
be a simple shot. Eventually he 
curses the idiocy of all the people 
he works with. Then he wakes 
up, feeling exhausted, and leaves 
for the day of shooting. Take af
ter take, the two actresses in the 
scene manage to perfectly nail 
down different types of perfor
mances that impressively range 
from horrendous to indifferent to 
perfect.
The second dream consists of 
the anxiety that the lead actress, 
played by Catherine Keener, has 
about her co-star, an untalented 
Hollywood hunk cast only for his 
marquee value. The actor is a 
veiled stab at Brad Pitt, who 
starred in DiCillos first movie
Johnny Suede. The actor arro
gantly goes about focusing the 
scene on himself, forcing the 
director to change the scene to 
his taste. The dischord on the 
set builds, until the actress 
wakes. The parody of Pitt is 
funny, but is even more effec
tive because of how the joke is 
applied to all Hollywood hunks.
The third section is the ac
tual day of shooting on the set 
after the dreams. Once again 
trouble quickly ensues, from 
problems with the smoke ma
chine, a dwarf, and the unex
pected appearance of the 
directors senile mother.
The frustration that DiCillo 
feels as a director comes 
through clearly in the film. He 
shows the myriad of difficul
ties that can happen in the 
making of the movie, and not 
just from his view, but the view
points of the entire cast. Maybe 
the humor and intelligence of 
this film will help DiCillo have 
his other ideas realized and 
his phone calls returned.

Incidentally, this film was made on a

The humor displayed in the dialogs

The music for this movie was provide

Although this movie does not star Quentin 
Tarantino, it is still an interesting piece of work. 
Luna means moon, as we all know, and this is very 
important to the story. There are these guys that 
do things that are interesting and theres a lot of 
things related to the moon. To be honest, I have no 
idea what this is about, and even the books I go 
through told me nothing. Nothing, I tell you!
So, go see this movie. Itll be a surprise. Tell me 
what it was about. Email jbdi and keep me posted. 
Im as clueless as you, but Im sure its an impor

Something goes wrong and Caruso gets arrested 
and a police-guy gets shot in the face. Then Caruso 
goes to jail and hangs out with Nicolas Cage. 
Theres a little bit of everything in here: revenge, 
faces being shot off, police. Its chock-full-o-plots.
Its a fairly recent movie and received fairly good

with someone who has been shot in the face.

This is a movie about some weird, new-fangled 
box that can crack any code in the entire world, 
which is pretty neat if you think about it. I bet it 
could crack decoder wheels on the back of Captn 
Crunch really quickly. It might take longer for 
codes like the kind you wrap around a stick to read, 
like I saw on Mr. Wizard. And it might take a while 
to figure out the kind that you tatoo on someones 
head and then send off, along with the guy, to the 
other person who is supposed to crack the code, but 
its a pretty impressive box, nonetheless.
Anyway, this movie stars River Phoenix, Dan I 
like Quentin Akroyd, and Robert Redford in a 
compu-chiller thriller that will keep you barking 
for more of that sweet, sweet stuff. Look for the

really feel you can accept that there are no cops in 
Taco Bell and that evenif there were, they wouldnt 
arrest you even if you go in there smelling like

High School Confidential, made in the 50s, is a 
startling expose on the dangers and mirthful may
hem of pot-fiends. Its movies like this that spear
headed the anti-drug movements and the decline

However, even 
with their notoriety 
as a stage group, Ive

this band. So, when presented 
with the opportunity to check out 
their Night of the Living Dead. 
production, I jumped at the 
chance, and, one night of theatre 
later, I was definitely not disap
pointed.
For those that dont know, 
Night of the Living Dead wa's a 
film made in the 60s by 
Pittsburghs own George Romero. 
The plot is as follows: brother and 
sister.are walking through a cem
etery, sister expresses fear of zom
bies, brother makes fun of her, 
points to a man staggering to
ward them, says hes a zombie, 
and proceeds to gethimselfkilled 
by the man, who really is a zom
bie. Sister drives to a house, ends 
up locked in there with a hunter, 
a family of four (one of which is 
fatally ill), and their collective 
wits against an army of zombies, 
who are standing outside, sub
dued by the fear of fire.
The zombies are a result of ra
diation from a defective U.S. space 
probe, which tells them to come 
back to life and eat people. I wont 
give away the ending, since some 
people actually havent seen the 
flick yet.
Rocky Horror Picture Show. 
There are three overlapping 
movie screens: a translucent 
sheet, an opaque moving screen, 
and another sheet behind it.
The opaque moving screen is 
segmented in areas, allowing for 
many surprises throughout the 
performance, such as the tri
angles which are knocked out in 
the second half to create the ef
fect of zombies arms reaching 
through a boarded-up door. 
Theres also a lot of really cool 
commentaries on the acting, such 
as the scene in which the men 
apd women of Squonk mirrored 
the exaggerated arm movements 
of Barbara and the hunter, with
out watching the screen. Romeros

The members of Squonk Opera freak as they realize that the phone is dead.
Anyhow, the real charm of this 
movie, much like The Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show, is that its just 
bad. Really bad. So bad, you fall 
to your kiiees laughing at it, dou
bling over and feeling a lot of 
pain.
The performance is done in a 
multimedia fashion. The movie 
is shown in a continuous man
ner, while the Squonkers add a 
musical theatre stage show, like 
a high-concept version of The
directing was victimized as well; 
bits like the white sphere which 
dropped from the top of the stage 
to add an extra dimension to the 
eyeball of the first corpse were 
priceless. They sent the audience 
(myself included) into uproari
ous laughter.
Of course, there were disad
vantages in the production; ev
ery so often, the Squonk bunch 
would get just a little oblique in 
their statements and songs (quoth
one of my colleagues during the 
intermission: Im not sure if Im 
being properly Squonked), and 
there were moments when you 
just werent sure what was going 
on.
However, if you rode these mo
ments out, they always justified 
themselves. A prime example: for 
about a minute or so, keyboardist 
Jackie Dempsey was shuffling 
back and forth on the stage, drop
ping a book, and screaming.
Two of the other members in 
the group started walking back 
and forth on the stage, pounding 
wooden planks on the stage, as 
the men on the screen were board
ing up the windows.
For a little while, everyone was 
lost, until the actions 
all fell into a rhyth
mic pattern which 
thrilled us all. I loved 
the scene, but its fea
sible that there was 
an audiences worth 
of What the ?s for 
a good little while.
Packed with up
roarious gimmicks, 
terrific dances, and 
stirring music, this 
production was 
clearly well thought 
out, and well pro
duced.
It was executed 
with amazing accu
racy and timing (the 
WHOMP sound 
jm Jefferson made by Squonk 
when the power went 
out on the screen was 
amazingly in sync, and the use of 
a moving watermelon as a per
cussive instrument while zom
bies were being knocked out in 
the first half was hilarious sim
ply because of its exquisite tim
ing), and the audience wenthome 
thoroughly entertained, if a bit 
confused. There are so many bits 
and pieces I want to write about, 
but I dont want to ruin the sur
prise. I will say that Id like to see 
it again with a bunch of friends.
