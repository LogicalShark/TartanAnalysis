Falling stones cause damage
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Acting Managing Editor
It wasnt a dramatic performance that 
brought down the roof of the College of 
Fine Arts early Thursday morning. In fact, 
at this point, it is unclear what caused six 
Marge granite slabs to fall from underneath 
the roof overhang of the building, said 
Marty Altschul, the University Engineer 
from Facilities Management Services 
(FMS). According to police reports, at 
approximately 2:40 am, the slabs under 
the roof overhang on the North West cor
ner of the building fell through an exterior 
ss roof, through a storage area, and 
then through the glass ceiling of the 
Hewlett Gallery.
Campus Police were notified of the inci
dent when Security Systems of America 
told them that a motion detector in the 
Hewlett Gallery had gone off. Upon arriv
ing on the scene, the responding officers 
determined that no one was injured and 
that a painting was knocked down from 
the debris. According to Altschul, Campus 
Police contacted FMS, which instructed
the Police to rope off the area and said they 
would begin an investigation later that 
morning.
Altschul said some experts were brought 
in to evaluate the possibility of this type of 
situation happening again. He said it may

take a couple of months to receive the 
results of those tests.
Currently, we have done nothing to pre
vent additional stones from coming down, 
he said.
FMS has, however, taken a number of 
precautions to prevent people from getting 
hurt or killed from any granite slabs that 
may still fall from the building, according 
to Altschul, who estimated that the stones 
probably weigh about 200 pounds a piece.
The opera in the Alumni Concert Hall 
(ACH) was canceled [Thursday] night, 
said Altschul. There is a similar skylight 
over that area of the building. Rather than 
take a chance, we canceled the perfor
mance, he said.
A contractor spent the day after the acci
dent assembling a protective scaffold to 
protect the doorway areas and the skylight 
over ACH. They also put plywood and plas
tic on a lower roof area to protect the areas 
underneath if more stones should fall. 
Finally, the perimeter of the building was 
roped off with yellow caution tape to keep 
people a safe distance away from 
the building.
It is common that buildings have a nom
inal life of about 100 years. Buildings like 
[CFA] are getting close [to this age], said 
Altschul. According to University Architect

Senate votes down parking proposals
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Acting Managing Editor
Student Senate rejected three proposals 
last Thursday regarding the allocation of 
transportation money for student govern
ment leaders starting with the 2000-2001 
school year. The proposals would have per
mitted the Student Body President (SBP) 
and Student Body Treasurer (SBT) to 
spend $200 per year on daily transporta
tion and for the Senate Chair to spend 
$100 per semester for the same purpose.
The proposals were introduced by 
Senates Campus Affairs Committee, 
which was charged with the task of inves
tigating how students felt about their pre
vious decision to provide parking permits 
for Student Government leaders. Senate 
decided to take this action after 1,000 stu
dents expressed their dissatisfaction six 
weeks ago by signing a petition asking 
Senate to reconsider its actions. The fund
ing of parking for this years officers 
became a moot point for Senate when Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy offered 
to pay for the permits from a discretionary 
fund, which was money provided from a 
donation, rather than from students.
The petition blanketed all the issues 
under one yes or no question. As was 
shown in the diversity of the survey 
responses, there were a lot of people who 
simply disliked it, but there were other 
people who would support it with one or 
two changes made, said Nick Fitzkee, 
Campus Affairs chair and junior physics 
major. To make an informed recommenda
tion, we needed to know the reasons 
behind the student bodys dislike of the 
motions, not simply that they disked 
them, he said.
In studying the issue, the Campus 
Affairs Committee interviewed the three 
individuals involved and sent an email 
survey to a random sampling of the stu
dent body. Fitzkee sent out a three-page 
letter explaining the issues involved and 
asked for students to respond with their 
comments. Out of the 10 percent of stu
dents the message was sent to, 79 percent 
of the students did not respond. In the 
draft of their report, the committee classi
fied the return surveys into categories  
total dont care (43 percent), total for 
(28 percent), total against (28 percent), 
and other (1 percent).
When the report was presented at the 
meeting, a number of Senators questioned 
how accurately students views were being 
represented. Criticism ranged from the 
fact that the survey letter was too long to 
the suggestion that the distribution of sur
veys may have been biased. Another fre
quently discussed complaint was that the 
grouping of responses into categories was 
too subjective.

NCAA overturns 
soccer decision
By DONNY DEBARR
Tartan Staff writer
On October 19, the UAA 
reversed the outcome of a varsi
ty mens soccer match between 
Carnegie Mellon and 
Washington University (WU). 
The decision was based on a 
protest made by WU, the first of 
its kind in NCAA or UAA histo
ry. Many CMU soccer players 
were upset at the efforts of CMU 
Athletic Director John Harvey 
in not upholding the decision. 
On October 3 the CMU mens 
soccer team defeated WU by a 
score of 2-1. WU went on to 
protest the outcome of the 
match, and eventually, got the 
game overturned so that they 
received a 1-0 victory. Many 
soccer players on the CMU team 
were upset at the decision.
Once I heard of the decision,
many thoughts ran through my 
mind. I could not fathom the 
idea of a protest. What does that 
mean? Does it mean that any 
mistake made by an official, 
timekeeper, or player warrants 
a protest? How could the game 
be decided off the field? 
Nonetheless, I was crushed hy 
the decision, said sophomore 
biology major Steve Tepper.
The protested issue from the 
match concerned the official time. 
During the second half of the 
match in question, with WU lead
ing by a score of 1-0, the referee 
found what he thought to be a 
malfunction in the operation of 
the scoreboard clock. He noticed 
an incongruity between the time 
on his watch and the time on the 
scoreboard. Immediately after he 
noticed this, he attempted to 
instruct the timekeeper to turn

Police arrest man for attempted rape
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
On Friday, October 22, a CMU 
student was sexually assaulted 
near Amberson Apartments 
while walking back from 
the University Center. A 
suspect was later arrested and 
identified as Lamond Anthony 
White, a 22-year old man 
from Wilkinsburg.
According to Pittsburgh city 
police reports and CMU police, 
the student was walking to the 
University Center when a man 
grabbed her from the rear and 
pulled her into a dark area with 
bushes and a fence near 
the Bayard Street entrance
to Amberson.
Another CMU student, while 
walking on a pathway that lead 
to the Bayard Street entrance, 
heard a noise. He found an 
Amberson Apartments security 
guard on duty and told him some
one was in distress. The guard 
approached the scene, yelling 
Does anyone need the police? At 
that point in time the assailant 
was on top of the victim. Upon 
hearing the guard, he jumped up 
and ran away, with his pants still 
around his knees. According to 
the guard, he then tripped head 
first into a parked vehicle, smash
ing his forearm into the window 
and ran off. Pittsburgh Police

CMU changes to new database system
By ALEX NEUSTEIN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon will transfer all of 
its existing financial databases from 
its previous systems to Oracle soft
ware, starting today. This initiative 
was handled by the Financial 
Management Project (FMP) team, a 
committee created specifically for 
this purpose. The most significant 
element of Carnegie Mellons financial 
management overhaul is the 
system-wide upgrade to Oracle

cialist of the FMP. The nice thing 
about buying packaged software is 
that it comes from a huge company 
with a huge research and development 
department and budget and they 
really have the resources to make 
constant improvements to the sys
tem, unlike CMU, which has limited 
resources available.
Carnegie Mellon currently utilizes 
proprietary in-house developed soft
ware. According to the FMP, there are 
about 25 different, non-compatible 
central accounting systems. As a 
result, the school needs an entire 
month to close the financial books at 
the end of the fiscal year. According to

attendance at a meeting held by John

Services coordinator for Computing

dean of Student Affairs.
Last Wednesday night, students who 
lost their network connection due to 
sharing copyrighted material were 
able to attend a meeting addressing 
the issue. The discussion was led by 
Lerchey and Fowler, who went over 
copyright laws and campus policies 
and then opened the floor 
to questions.
Several issues arose that concerned 
the students present. Several students 
complained about the method of the 
search, saying that it wasnt complete
ly random and, therefore, was not a 
true statistical analysis of the problem. 
Lerchey said that he had no predeter
mined number of machines to search 
and that no specific people were tar
geted. He added, however, that when a 
trail to other violating machines was 
presented, he followed it.
Students also said they were also 
uncomfortable with the testing of pass

Man confesses to killing 
140 children in Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)  A drifter 
who could turn out to be among historys 
worst serial killers has confessed to 
killing 140 children in a five-year spree, 
>luring his victims by posing as a beggar, 
' *a cripple, or a monk, Colombias chief 
prosecutor said.
The victims of Luis Alfredo Garavito, 
42, were found with their throats slit 
and showing signs of having been tied 
up and mutilated, prosecutor Alfonso 
Gomez told a news conference Friday.
This has no precedent in Colombia, 
he said.
Garavito was arrested in April during 
an 18-month investigation into the dis
appearances of children in at least 11 
-Colombian states. Only 114 bodies have 
been found thus far.
Gomez said the evidence against 
Garavito was so strong that it prompted 
the confession. He said Garavito would 
not be charged with the murders until 
the investigation was complete.
The victims were mostly poor. Many of 
them were children of street vendors, 
often left unattended in parks and at 
city stoplights to solicit money from 
motorists.
Garavito passed himself off as a street 
vendor, monk, indigent, disabled person, 
or a representative of fictitious founda
tions for the elderly and childrens edu
cation, in that way gaining entrance to 
schools as a speaker, Gomez said.
The suspect was shown in police mug 
shots to be a tall, dark-skinned man  
sometimes wearing glasses, and some
times with a mustache or beard and a 
baseball cap.
Gomez said Garavito often gained vic
tims confidence by offering money or a 
drink, then persuading them to go for a 
walk. Many of the skeletal remains were 
, found tied up with nylon rope, liquor bot,.tles discarded nearby.
The aunt of two young paperboys 
.whose bodies were found last November 
,,in Pereira, a city in Colombias western 
coffee-producing region, said the boys 
..disappeared a year ago, but for us it
still feels like it was yesterday.
If this man is really the assassin of 
my two nephews, I want him to get the 
death penalty, Maria Aleida Velez told 
The Associated Press by telephone.
Until last November, police had 
few clues into a multiyear rash of 
child disappearances. It was then 
that the remains of 25 boys ages 8 
through 16 were found in a ravine and 
an overgrown lot in Pereira, Gomez said.
That gruesome discovery, initially 
thought by local authorities to be the 
work of a satanic cult, prompted author
ities to create a nationwide task force 
that began to encounter similarities 
between cases across the country, he 
said.
That effort turned up an arrest war
rant for Garavito in a 1996 homicide 
case of a child in the north-central city of 
Tunja.
At the time of his arrest in the eastern 
provincial city of Villavicencio, where he 
is currently being held, Garavito was liv
ing under an assumed name, prosecutors 
said. He was arrested on suspicion of the 
attempted rape there in April of a 12- 
year-old boy.
Garavito moved around the country 
frequently after the killings began in 
1994, and also spent time in Ecuador, 
where investigations are under way to 
determine whether he might be linked to 
child slayings in the neighboring coun
try, the prosecutor said.
The most killings took place in the 
western state of Risaralda, of which 
Pereira is the capital. Forty-one bodies 
have been found in Pereira and another 
27 have turned up in neighboring Valle 
de Cauca.
Most serial murder cases pale in com
parison to the size of Garavitos alleged 
killing spree. Among the worst known 
cases of serial killings in recent decades 
is that of former sailor Anatoliy 
Onoprienko, who has been sentenced to 
death in Ukraine after being convicted of 
murdering 52 people from 1989 to 1996.
Court arraigns Y2K readiness 
judge on drugs eludes colleges
PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania 
(AP)  A judge has been released on 
$10,000 bail after being arraigned 
on charges of drug use, including 
shooting heroin in her chambers 
and protecting her dealer in 
exchange for drugs.
Judge Robert Dauer released 
District Judge Gigi Sullivan 
on bail, contingent on her 
completing a drug treatment pro
gram. Prosecutors had requested 
$50,000 bail.
Her lawyer, Patrick Thomassey, 
said Sullivan was in the 
treatment program last week 
when Attorney General Mike 
Fisher announced the charges 
against her.
He acknowledged that Sullivan, 
38, has had a long history of 
prescription drug abuse, but 
made no comment Monday about 
other accusations.
The judge set a preliminary hear
ing for Nov. 1.
On Friday, Fisher issued the 
charges against the judge, 
accusing her of using heroin, 
cocaine, and prescription drugs. 
Fisher alleged that she accepted 
drugs in exchange for dismissing 
cases against her supplier and 
other dealers.
She was also accused of posses
sion of heroin and cocaine, kiting a 
$2,000 check, and accepting bribes.
In Pennsylvania, district justices 
sit as magistrates, holding prelimi
nary hearings, ruling on minor 
crimes, and issuing protection-fromabuse orders.
Sullivan, a Democrat, is up for 
election to a second, six-year 
term on Nov. 2, facing Republican 
David Sosovicka, despite the fact 
that she has been ordered not to 
hear cases.
Shes still on the ballot for dis
trict magistrate, Thomassey said. 
These are just allegations. She is 
not convicted. Shell remain on the 
ballot and maybe be elected. 
Wouldnt that be something?
EAST LANSING, Michigan (UWIRE)/7Vie State News  A study 
released by the U.S. Department of 
Education Wednesday said about 
200 colleges and universities 
will not be Y2K compliant by 
Jan. 1, 2000.
The point were trying to make is 
that schools have a mountain to 
move, said Jim Bradshaw, a 
spokesman for the department.
Rochele Cotter, the coordinator of 
MSUs Progress 2000 Team, said 
MSUs computers will be ready 
for 2000.
Were in good shape, she said. 
Were continuing to look for 
Y2K problems.
Bradshaw said 1,200 colleges and 
universities participated in the tele
phone survey. He said in the 
extreme cases after Jan. 1, the col
leges and universities may have 
problems with heating systems 
breaking down, student records get
ting corrupted and building and 
security systems failing.
Colleges and universities should 
have an independent company look 
at their systems, Bradshaw said, 
to make doubly sure that theyll be 
working correctly come Jan. 1.
This is the second survey the 
department has conducted this year, 
said David Dexter, deputy director of 
the departments Y2K Project Tfeam.
Dexter said this survey was con
ducted as a follow-up to a summer 
survey that found only a third of the 
colleges and universities surveyed 
Y2K compliant.
The fall survey showed that 97 
percent of all colleges and universi
ties expect to have their systems 
ready by Jan. 1, he said.
The Y2K problem is an error in 
the way computers and their 
programs understand dates. 
Originally, computer programs were 
written to read dates in the twodigit form to save money. For 
example, the date 1967 was written 
in programs as 67. With the 
millennium approaching, some
computers wont know the differ
ence between 1900 and 2000 
because they will read both 
dates as 00.
Internet passes 
30 year mark
ATHENS, Ohio (U-WIRE)/77ie Post
 Thirty years ago Friday, the 
Internet spoke its first word  barely.
On Oct. 29, 1969, scientists gath
ered at the University of California 
in Los Angeles to send an electron
ic message to a group at the 
Stanford Research Institute in 
northern California.
We had a guy sitting at the com
puter console at UCLA wearing a 
telephone headset and a micro
phone, talking to another guy at 
Stanford, said Leonard Kleinrock, 
a UCLA engineering professor 
widely heralded as the father of the 
Internet. When everything was set 
up he was going to type the word 
log and the Stanford computer 
would automatically add in to com
plete the word login.
So our guy typed the L and 
asked his counterpart at Stanford 
Did you get the L?  and Stanford 
replied, Got the L.  Then they did 
the same for O and the G and 
then the whole system crashed, 
Kleinrock said.
Some people blame the Internet 
for intensifying darker aspects of 
society such as invasion of privacy, 
pedophilia, hacking, terrorism, 
and destruction of property, 
Kleinrock said.
The Net provides an enormous 
level of anonymity whereby from 
ones bedroom one can reach out to 
the entire connected world. And 
thats a power trip for some that 
misuse that power, he said.
But Kleinrock said policing the 
Internet or passing regulations 
might not be the best solution.
Theres no silver bullet to cor
rect those problems, he said. 
You teach your children proper 
moral ethics and morality and 
hope they behave well when they 
get out there.FBI reports crime rates are at their lowest level in thirty years
WASHINGTON (AP)  
Murder and robbery rates 
dropped to the lowest levels in 
three decades in 1998 as serious 
reported crimes declined for the 
seventh straight year, but 
officials and experts warn 
against complacency.
The overall violent crime rate 
566 murders, rapes, rob
beries, and assaults per 100,000 
residents  dropped to its low
est level since 556 in 1985^ 
jiist before an epidemic of crack 
cocaine emerged to send 
it'soaring.
 The report also showed the 
use of guns in homicides and 
robberies is decreasing, and one 
of the most terrifying crimes 
tftat rose with the crack epidem
ic  murder by a stranger  
dropped below half of all slay
ings for only the second time 
during the 1990s.
President Clinton and others 
warned against complacency, 
however.
This is good news for 
Americas families, and it shows 
we can indeed turn the tide on 
crime, Clinton said in a state
ment. But, he added, even as 
crime falls, we must not let 
down our guard. That is why we 
must redouble our efforts to 
build on what works.
Attorney General Janet Reno 
said that as a Florida prosecu
tor, she saw constituents lose 
interest in crime issues after 
rates fell for several years. If 
we continue our efforts, we can 
have a substantial impact on 
violence and make it perma
nent, she said.Four-Day Forecast

Reno attributed gains so far to 
more police officers on the 
street, greater partnerships 
between law enforcement agen
cies, continued efforts to keep 
guns away from criminals, and a 
balanced approach that includes 
prevention, intervention, pun
ishment, and supervision.
Reno also expressed surprise 
at the decline in crime among 
those in the 15-24 age group. 
The number of young people is 
increasing in America, and we 
thought that there would be a 
higher crime rate some time ago 
because of that, she said.
We are watching the crime 
rate go down, although the ado
lescent population has 
increased, she said on ABCs 
Good Morning America. 
Republicans credited their leg-Carnegie Almanac
islation encouraging longer 
prison sentences for the drop in 
crimes. Criminologists also cited 
the aging of baby boomers past 
crime-prone years and the 
decline of crack markets.
During 1998, the violent 
crimes of murder, rape, robbery, 
and aggravated assault, and the 
far more numerous property 
crimes  burglary, auto theft, 
and larceny-theft  all dropped 
in number and rate.
The violent crime rate was 
down 7.3 percent, led by an 11.3 
percent drop for robbery and a 
7.4 percent decline for murder. 
The rape rate declined 4.2 per
cent to the lowest in 15 years.
Professor Alfred Blumstein of 
Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh credited big-city 
police departments with step
ping up searches for guns, trac
ing guns to illegal sellers, 
and even paying bounties to 
turn in guns  as well as back
ground checks to prevent sales 
to felons.
Criminologists said the 
national figures obscure a lin
gering problem: Although teen
age killings have been cut in 
half since their 1993 peak, 
they remain nearly twice as 
high as in 1984  before crack 
gangs began arming some 
youths, and their schoolmates 
got guns to copy them or 
for protection.
The crack epidemic has sub
sided, but we havent taken all 
the guns out of the hands of 
youths, said James Alan Fox, 
professor of criminal justice at 
Bostons Northeastern
University. Youth crime is down 
but not out.
Police have adopted smarter 
strategies, focusing on guns and 
high-risk juveniles, taking a 
preventive approach rather 
than waiting in squad cars for 
911 to ring, Fox continued.
But if we spend too much 
time celebrating and let our 
guard down, the problem could 
resurface with a vengeance, 
because every year for the next 
couple decades were going to 
have a record number of black 
and Latino teen-agers, and they 
live in the most at-risk situa
tions, Fox said.
Crime dropped in every 
region: 7 percent in the
Northeast and West, 5 percent 
in the South and 4 percent in 
the Midwest.
50 YEARS AGO, November 1, 
1949  Becoming the first frater
nity to own their own house, the

elaborate mortgage-burning cere

weekend. More than two hundred 
Kappa Sigma alumni planned to 
attend, including 1926 allAmerican quarterback Howie 
Harpster.
The Delta Alpha chapter of 
Kappa Sigma was incorporated

25 YEARS AGO, November 5, 
1974  With the presence of 
student aides at the entrances 
of Doherty Hall and Science 
Hall, vandalism and theft 
were curtailed.
The aides worked from 10 pm 
to 10 am at the main entrances
from National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
and asked entering students to 
sign in. Were not supposed to 
hassle anyone who doesnt want 
to sign in, though, said one 
student aide.
When asked if he thought there 
was any real purpose to his job, 
one aide said, I dont really 
know. Im just doing it. 
Another student aide said, 
Any purpose to my job? 
Truthfully, no.
10 YEARS AGO, October 31, 
1989  On November 13, the 
board of Trustees planned to 
meet and decide on the fate of 
Skibo, the social university cen
ter. It was likely that 
Skibo would be torn down and 
replaced with a new 
University Center nearly twice 
its size, according to the
recently formed University 
Center Committee.
According to Vice Present for 
University Planning Patrick J. 
Keating, the committees execu
tive director, there were many 
advantages to razing Skibo. 
The new building will provide a 
more central and cohesive facili
ty, really a campus center. 
Aesthetically, it will obviously 
be much better.
FIVE YEARS AGO,

accordance with Pennsylvania 
state law, Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys administration 
blocked on-campus computer 
users from gaining access to 
certain computer bulletin 
boards that contained sexually 
explicit material.
Our official policy is to 
obey the law, said Bill Arms, 
vice president for Computing 
Services. Eighty-one bulletin 
boards in all were scheduled 
to be eliminated.
ONE YEAR AGO, November 
2,1998  On November 16, stu
dents were randomly assigned 
time intervals of 30 minutes 
that started at 6 am and ended 
at 4:30 pm. Students were only 
allowed to start registering after 
their assigned time slot. This 
adjustment was designed to 
improve the systems perfor
mance and lessen the time it 
takes for students to complete 
the registration process.

Senate pushes off future plans for officer permits
PARKING, from page 1
results were classified, Senate 
voted to accept the report with 
all references to being for or 
against removed from the offi
cial version of
the report.
In what they viewed as a com
promise, the Campus Affairs 
Committee suggested the pro
posals that would have provided 
subsidies for daily travel 
expenses of the three officers. 
Since the committee determined 
that the mobility of these lead
ers would benefit the student 
body, they felt the students 
would be satisfied with the com
promise. Specifically, it 
addressed common complaints 
from students that the leaders 
should have to apply for a spot 
like other students, that it 
shouldnt be implied that these 
leaders must have cars, and that 
parking could be used on an asneeded basis. Also, this 
would affect future leaders, 
not the ones currently holding
the positions.
The majority of Senators voted 
against the three proposals. In 
addition, the three individuals 
to whom the parking issue 
applied this year said they did 
not support the proposals.
SBP Sarah Gross, a senior social 
history major and first- year Heinz 
student, said that she felt the rea
soning that $200 would cover a 
parking pass for one day per week 
was unfeasible because the SBP 
can not schedule all meetings for 
only one day. She also said that if 
such proposals were to pass, they 
should take effect for the 
2003-2004 school year.
After what many members of 
student government have gone 
through in the last couple of 
months, I feel that it would be 
better for everyone if Senate 
passed a resolution supporting 
parking subsidies (or whatever 
they want to recommend) that 
wouldn't go into effect until the 
2003-2004 school year," said 
Gross. "That way, neither the
decision makers nor the current 
students would be affected by 
it," she said.
If the Treasurer next year 
does nothing, then they do not 
deserve a permit. However, if 
their heart is in the work, then 
the $200 may not be adequate to 
meet their needs, said SBT 
Dave Liber, a junior ethics, his
tory, and public policy major.
Similarly, Senate Chair Pat 
Ditterline, a senior electrical 
and computer engineering 
major, said he felt that in the 
future, this issue should be han
dled on a case-by-case basis. He 
said that he has not used his 
permit as much for official busi
ness as he expected he would. 
Some Senators also questioned 
whether Liber was using his 
permit in the way he anticipat
ed, specifically with respect to 
going downtown to see an 
accountant. When Liber was 
asked if he had gone there yet, 
he answered that he had not.
Both Ditterline and Gross said
that they did not accept the 
money offered by Dean Murphy.
I never accepted any money 
or special treatment because the 
motions had not passed through 
Senate and there was opposition 
to the motions in the Student 
Body, said Ditterline, who 
already had a permit before he 
became chair and intended to 
pay for it himself if the original 
motions didnt pass.
When Dean Murphy offered 
the money, it was because he felt 
that the problem was that stu
dents were paying for the per
mits and he wanted to allow 
Senate to proceed with business 
as usual without being ham
pered by the permit issue. Since 
that was not the whole issue 
and Senate began to move 
again anyway... there was no 
reason to take the money just 
to allow Senate to proceed, 
he said.
According to Fitzkee, he was 
not disappointed that his 
committees recommendation
was rejected.
In my opinion, whether 
Senate approved or disapproved 
of the proposals is irrelevant. I

I) believe it deserved, said

Stones shut down art gallery
STONES, from page 1
Paul Tellers, CFA was com: 
pleted in 1916.
This is a tremendous 
worry. Weve done already 
extensive repairs to 
Margaret Morrison,
Hamerschlag, and Doherty, 
said Tellers. We try our best 
to keep track of where things 
are weak and make repairs.
Roofing inspections are 
done annually to make sure 
things arent loose. The last 
inspection was last fall and 
there was no indication 
from those reports about 
these stones, said Altschul.
Altschul added that a 
room-by-room inspection of 
the University was conduct
ed last June and no problems 
with the stones were identi
fied at that point either. He 
acknowledged, however,'that 
the effectiveness of visual 
inspections is limited. The 
only way to determine the 
strength of the buildings 
structure is to do destructive 
testing, which is not always 
feasible, said Altschul. 
Earlier this year, the 
contractor determined that 
the brickwork on part of 
Doherty Hall was not in good 
shape after doing this type 
of testing.
There is certainly a cost 
issue involved with doing 
destructive testing. The cost
would increase by a factor of 
10 to do that type of inspec
tion, said Altschul.
He also added that such 
testing would be an incon
venience to the University 
community, with scaffolding 
needing to be set up and 
access to buildings being 
restricted. In addition, 
another problem with doing 
this type of testing is that 
the original property needs 
to be destroyed when it is 
likely that nothing was 
wrong in the first place. It 
is also possible to cause 
a problem that did not 
originally exist.
In an ideal world, Id 
like to test everything. 
From a practical matter, 
our visual inspections need 
to be more frequent and 
sensitive to actions that 
are possible and take 
actions based on that, 
said Altschul.
Altschul said that this 
is not the first time 
such an incident has 
occurred. He said pieces of 
terracotta fell down 
during construction near 
Hamerschlag Hall. Another 
similar incident occurred 
with Margaret Morrison 
about eight years ago, 
said Tellers.
As far as this accident 
goes, Indonesian artist
Entang Wiharsos exhibit 
Melting Souls was nearing 
the end of its October 29 
closing in the Hewlett 
Gallery when the accident 
occurred. After assessing 
the painting which had fall
en from the wall, Wiharso
comment further on the 
accident, but said that the 
next scheduled exhibit, 
Margery Amdurs HIGH ly 
STRUNG will be delayed 
one week.
The opera, Dialogues of 
the Carmelites, took place
Seth Mandel/Tartan Acting Managing Editor 
Six granite stones fell from the decorative overhang on 
CFA, through a glass cieling, a storage room, and skylight.
said that the damage was 
not significant.
The irony is that there 
was only one more show 
scheduled before the 
Hewlett Gallery is closed 
and moved to the Regina 
Gouger Miller Gallery, said 
Petra Fallaux, director of 
the Regina Gouger Miller 
Gallery, who is also respon
sible for the Hewlett 
Gallery. Fallaux declined to
as scheduled for Friday 
night after precautionary 
measures were taken and 
the area was deemed to be 
safe, according to Altschul. 
The performance of And the 
World Goes Round in the 
Kresge Theater did not need 
to be canceled because most 
of the area was 
considered safe. A potential
ly dangerous work area 
was restricted.
Candidates run for Senate positions
ELECTIONS, from page 1
Body President elections this 
semester (which excludes gradu
ate students from voting) and the 
lack of candy at the voting table 
may have influenced the poor 
turnout. However, he noted, the 
amount of candidates was actual
ly up in some schools: It was a 
tough year in some schools  a 
very close vote in H&SS and MCS 
especially... Im happy with the 
way it turned out.
Senate Internal Affairs 
Committee Chair Kevin Shiue, a 
senior computer science major, 
agrees. I was somewhat disap
pointed [with the voter turnout]. 
On the plus side, though, there 
were at least a couple of people 
who tried to get people to vote 
based on past issues. Shuie hopes, 
that student interest in Senate 
will continue. Nick [Fitzkee] was 
saying that when people got the 
email survey about Senate park
ing passes, a lot of people wrote 
back saying they didnt care. It 
leads me to question whether [the 
fierce debate on Senate issues] is 
the result of a few vocal people or 
genuine interest in Senate. 
Controversy helped get Daniel 
Shaykevich, a junior computer sci
ence major and a new SCS senator, 
interested in Student Senate. 
Basically, I saw the usual apathy 
on campus and I thought Fd give 
[Senate] a try. Shaykevich has been 
observing Senate meetings for some
time, and hopes to concentrate on 
getting more accurate, unbiased 
feedback from students, perhaps by 
joining the Campus Affairs commit
tee. He also hopes to work on issues 
affecting SCS students, such as get
ting sections of CSW specifically for 
SCS, to teach UNIX and other skills 
that are commonly used in comput
er science.
Ashley Campbell, a newly 
elected Senator in H&SS and a 
sophomore in social and deci
sion sciences, was also attracted 
to Senate because he perceived 
a lack of communication 
between Senators and students. 
After the last major crisis, I 
started to observe Senate meet
ings. I realized that [neither 
Senate nor the students] were 
doing anything wrong, but that 
there was little communication 
between the two. Thats not 
appropriate, for an elected body 
to be out of touch with its elec
torate. By observing, I got a lot 
of respect for the amount of 
work that they do. Campbell 
hopes to join the Public 
Relations or Campus Affairs 
committees, and work with the 
administration on the campus 
issues he finds most upset
ting: the state of parking on 
campus and food services. Its 
fantastically difficult for an 
undergraduate to find parking 
on campus.... Its an undue dis
traction from studies.

Computing Services 
holds student meeting
COMPUTING, from page 1
any machines active on it are subject to 
inspection. We have every right to look 
and see whats going on, Lerchey said. 
The issue of opening folders not explic
itly marked public also arose. The 
Computing Code of Ethics states, On 
shared computing systems, all user 
files and directories are considered to 
be private and confidential. Only files 
which a user has explicitly made public 
(e.g., by placing in a public directory) 
should be considered open for general 
access. Accessing and using files in 
another persons directory when not 
expressly permitted to do so by the 
owner is a violation of that persons pri
vacy. Lerchey said, however, that he 
considered folders marked mp3, for 
example, to be placed 
on the network for public access, there
fore allowing Computing Services to 
search it.
Many students said they were upset 
with the lack of notification that 
occurred when the disconnection took 
place. There were two students who 
appealed the decision to pull their con
nections to Computing Services, who 
then recognized that the files were 
within regulations and immediately 
restored the network connection. To 
prevent events like this, Lerchey said 
that, in the future, students will be told 
in advance that they are going to be 
disconnected, so that innocent people 
will have the opportunity to defend 
themselves before their connection is 
lost. He also said, though, that in this 
case, if the search had been announced 
earlier, We wouldnt have gotten a 
clear snapshot of what was happening 
on the network.
After attending the meeting and 
writing a brief description of why their 
actions were in violation of University 
and community policies, students were 
able to reduce the time they would be 
disconnected to four weeks. They will 
have their connections returned by 
November 14.
Student Dormitory Council (SDC) 
and Student Senate are also currently
working together to address these! 
concerns. At their meetings last week,! 
both organizations passed a similar! 
resolution focusing on many of! 
the above issues. Phil Fong, a sopho-! 
more electrical and computer engineer-! 
ing major, was chosen to head! 
a committee within SDC to deal with! 
the situation. He has been working! 
with Nick Fitzkee, a junior physics! 
major and Campus Affairs chair of! 
Student Senate.
Fong posted messages to bboards and! 
collected email in order to! 
find the general consensus of how stu
dents felt about the process and resultof Computing Servicess search.- 
Many questions arose about the meth-! 
ods used....We felt that Computing! 
Services wasnt working in the! 
best interest of the student body,! 
said Fong.
While both organizations said thatthey dont condone the distribution ofcopyrighted material and that they 
support University policies, they felt; 
that the sweep wasnt the best way to; 
achieve the goal of educating and; 
informing students about copyright; 
laws and policies. 
One concern was that there; 
are currently multiple copies of the' 
University Policy on computing 
ethics, which take different stands b)n 
passwords and privacy, making 
it unclear what the true policy is. 
They also disliked that students 
werent given notice about their 
disconnection, causing interruption 
and loss of work, and that the files in 
question werent specifically investigate 
ed in order to protect potentially 
innocent students.
SDC and Student Senate are 
hoping to pass a second resolution 
making recommendations to 
Computing Services for ways to pre-> 
vent controversies in the future-* 
Fitzkee said that he hoped this would 
be the beginning of a active partner^ 
ship between SDC and Senate 
in watching out for the student 
bodys interests.
CMU changes databases to new Oracle system
ORACLE, from page 1
users of the current system, one of the 
biggest difficulties with the scattered 
systems is the need for multiple user
names and passwords, and lack of cus
tomer support.
The neat thing about Oracle is that 
its a push to an integrated software 
package, said Westrick. No longer do 
I have to keep track of ten different 
logins and passwords. I have one place 
which I go to for everything.
According to the FMP Web site, bene
fits to departments will include replacing 
paper reports with online ones. 
Information will be collated to spread
sheets directly from Oracle. All research 
information will reside within Oracle.
Training for the new system is esti
mated to take about 40 hours at most. 
The FMP is offering various training 
schedules in order accommodate differ
ent schedules.
In addition to purchasing the Oracle 
software, Andersen Consulting was hired 
to aid in various aspects that had to be 
customized for CMUs financial system. ;
CMU does business in a very differ-; 
ent way than most businesses, said 
Westrick. The software has to be cus-; 
tomized. We have a team of about 15 
programmers who are working to cus-; 
tomize the code for CMU.
The estimated cost of this project is in 
the millions.
I know that the software was about 
seven million dollars, said Westrick; 
This does not include personnel costs or 
any additional customization whictj 
required outside consultation. 
According to the FMP Web site, the 
University spends about seven million 
dollars a year on financial transaction^ 
and management.

A SUITE FOR LESSTHAN A HOTEL ROOM
UAA overturns CMU mens soccer victory
SOCCER, from page 1
instruct the timekeeper to turn off the 
scoreboard clock, so as not to further con
fuse the players, coaches, or fans. This 
attempt was unsuccessful, and the time
keeper kept the scoreboard running, lb 
remedy this situation, the referee 
informed all of the players and both 
coaches that he was keeping the official 
time on the field. The coaches then once 
again yelled to their players to further 
clarify the fact that the time on the score
board was void, that they shouldnt pay 
any attention to it, and to play right 
through the scoreboards buzzer until the 
referees whistle signaled the end of play. 
These multiple steps to cover the mal
function in the scoreboard achieved their 
desired goal and play continued. CMU 
then scored a goal to tie the match. After 
Carnegie Mellon scored the goal 
Washington University complained
about the discrepancy between the final 
buzzer and whistle. Carnegie Mellon 
then added another goal in overtime to 
give them the win.
WU protested by citing a partial por
tion of a UAA bylaw, which states that, 
When an electronically controlled 
scoreboard clock is visible to both 
benches and spectators, it shall be used 
as the official timepiece, and there 
shall be one official timekeeper desig
nated by the home team. It later stat
ed in the same rule: In the event that 
the official timing device malfunctions, 
the referee on the field shall become 
the timekeeper.
If you look at the rules, the refs did 
everything they were supposed to do, 
said sophomore social and decision sci
ences (SDS) major and mens soccer 
player Thomas Dougherty. Harvey said 
that when the UAA was investigating
whether or not to overrule the decision, 
they consulted the editor of the rulebook for his interpretation of this par
ticular rule.
Many of the players, however, did not 
agree that this was even the rule 
in contention.
The players held a conference with 
Harvey to discuss their distress and to 
investigate what steps were taken to 
oppose the protest.
I think that the protest being ruled 
for Wash U. is largely due to Harveys 
failure to properly represent us as a 
team, said junior SDS major and 
mens soccer player Damian Olesnycky.
When asked about the decision at the 
meeting, Harvey said that CMU should 
not have been declared the winner. He 
also said that he initially was against 
the idea of a protest, but that when all 
of the athletic directors from the con
Police arrest sexual assault suspect
ARREST, from page 1
detectives later collected glass frag
ments with blood from the scene.
According to Sergeant Richard Sima 
of CMU Police, the assailant apparent
ly went to his friends house and told 
her that he had been stabbed. She told 
him to go to Presbyterian Hospital.
! The victim was questioned by CMU 
Police, and also transported to Presby 
Hospital by a Medic unit. At the hospi
tal CMU Police met with the 
Pittsburgh police detectives. White 
entered the emergency ward, and the 
victim immediately identified him as 
her assailant. Hospital staff told the 
detectives that there appeared to be 
slivers of glass throughout Whites 
wound. It was determined that there 
was probable cause to place White 
under arrest.
! It was bizarre the way it tran
spired, said Sima.
> White said that he was in 
Wilkinsburg and had plans to go to a 
night club in Oakland. While walking
to Oakland, he was accosted by two 
unknown males on the corner of 
Susquehana St. and Braddock Ave. who 
tried to rob him. White said one man 
attempted to strike him with an 
unknown item and that he blocked the 
strike with his arm, and afterwards the 
men fled on foot. White then said he 
called a friend from a pay phone, 
walked to her house, and called for 
medics to take him to Presby hospital.
The victim said that her assailant 
had tried to penetrate her, but was 
unable to do so before the security 
guard showed up on the scene.
Many students over the past week 
were angry that they were not 
informed about the incident.
Sometime within the last week I 
saw a news camera on campus. Later 
that day, there was a piece on one of 
the local news stations about an 
attempted rape on campus, said 
Daniel Postoian, a junior in civil and 
environmental engineering, in a post 
to the electronic bulletin board 
emu. misc. market. Postoian added that
he was upset when he saw in the 
broadcast a CMU police officer posting 
signs about the assault, but he had yet 
to see them.
According to CMU Police Lieutenant 
Mary Suber and Sima, the signs were 
posted in all residence buildings in con
junction with Student Life. Perhaps it 
was an oversight not posting immedi
ately to the academic buildings, said 
Sima. Academic buildings were posted 
with the alert shortly afterwards.
Later last week, rumors on misc. mar
ket suggested that that there were two 
such attempted rapes. The officers said 
the confusion was probably caused by 
the Channel 11 News broadcast, report
ed by Alison Ash, which stated there 
was an attempted rape and then 
showed a camera shot of the CMU cam
pus in front of Warner Hall, when in 
fact the assault had occurred off cam
pus near Amberson. Many students 
probably thought the shot suggested a 
separate incident, they said.
[Advertising Manager Bradley Fearn
ference met, he agreed to let the 
protest go through. According to some 
players, his inadequacies in dealing 
with the situation led to the eventual 
ruling of the protest for WU.
Im just not sure if Harvey did all he 
could to stand up for us, said junior 
business administration major and 
mens soccer player David Zupon.
Harvey continued to hold strongly to 
his contention that WU should be 
awarded the game. I feel the ruling was 
based on the rule book and therefore cor
rect, he said. He said that he does sup
port the teams right to appeal the deci
sion, however. On Friday, Harvey sent 
along a letter to the secretary of the UAA 
hat was drafted by senior co-captains 
Benjamin Kartzman, an SDS major, and 
David Huryk, a biology major. The letter, 
which asked for an appeal to the deci
sion, was not endorsed by Harvey but he
did send a memo encouraging the UAA 
to consider it. Harvey also said he will 
send a letter to the East Coast Athletic 
Conference (ECAC), pointing out the cir
cumstances under which the soccer team 
lost one of its two games, in the hope 
that it will help the teams chances of 
getting into the ECAC playoffs.
Harvey refusing to sign the letter of 
appeal that we drafted as a team exem
plifies the fact that he still refuses to 
live up to his job title, and still will not 
represent the voice and opinions of his 
constituency which in this particular 
matter is us, the mens soccer team, 
said senior business major and soccer 
player Doug Jones.
Kartzman and Huryk plan to spread 
word of the protest and their feelings 
about Harveys inabilities to President 
Cohon, the Board of Trustees, soccer 
alumni, and various national soccer
Crime and Incident Report
10/25 NUISANCE ALARM, 9:18pm
- The burglar alarm in a locked and 
unoccupied room in Hamburg Hall 
went off, and Campus Police respond
ed. Since this room has had several 
false alarms in the past, an alarm his
tory was requested for this room. The 
room has had a total of 71 false alarms 
in slightly more than three weeks.
10/29 TERRORISTIC THREATS,
12:26am - A male CMU student was con
tacted over AOL Instant Messenger by a 
female from the Midwest, and was asked 
if they could converse over email. He said 
yes, and she began sending sexually 
explicit emails, and telling him over the 
phone that she loved him. At this time, 
the CMU student was unaware that the 
person he was communicating with was 
only 16 years old. They both divulged per
sonal information about themselves, 
including where on campus the CMU stu
dent lives. She had given him fake infor
mation about her appearance, but later 
sent a picture of her real self, along with 
a note stating how much she loved him.
Just prior to receiving this note, the 
CMU student broke up with her. In 
previous conversations, she communi
cated to him that her friends have 
guns, and would use them on someone 
who hurt her. She also said something 
about putting a hole in [her ex
boyfriend]. She mentioned that she 
and her friends might come to the PittWest Virginia football game, hosted at 
Pitt, the weekend of 10/30.
On 10/28, the girls sister called the 
CMU student to inform him that she 
had overdosed on sleeping pills, and was 
in the hospital. The sister also said that 
the girls friends were flying out to see 
her, because she was in a coma, and that 
she would show them the email from 
him, telling her to get out of his life.
The student told Campus Police that 
he was afraid for his life, and did want 
the info desk to give out his informa
tion. The student declined to stay in a 
designated safe house on campus.

Master plan requires input from students
Tomorrow at 7 pm, CMU will 
hold a town meeting to begin plan
ning the next campus master plan. 
This meeting will give current stu
dents, faculty, and staff a rare, 
valuable opportunity to hear from 
the architects hired by CMU about 
the campus planning process and 
to influence the development of 
Carnegie Mellons campus over the 
next several decades. Students 
should make every effort to attend 
this meeting and provide feedback 
on how to develop CMUs future.
The master plans goals focus 
around the development of the 
Universitys physical resources. It 
includes the architecture of indi
vidual buildings, layout of the cam
pus as a whole, pedestrian and 
traffic circulation, landscaping, and 
connecting the campus with sur
rounding neighborhoods. With the 
completion of the University Cen
ter and Roberts Hall in 1996 and 
the Purnell Center this year, the 
most recent master plan, estab
lished in 1987, is nearly fulfilled.
As this plan nears completion, 
the administration has turned its 
attention to the establishment of a 
new one for the coming years. Con
tinued growth of campus facilities 
is vital to the Universitys future, 
as it provides the space necessary 
to create new programs and ex
pand upon existing ones. Additional 
work planned includes integration 
ofthe west campus, improving open 
spaces, and addressing safety con
cerns related to having Forbes Av
enue run through campus.
To this end, CMU has hired 
Ayers/Saint/Gross, an architecture 
firm based in Baltimore, MD, to 
help guide the development of a 
new plan. The creation of this new 
plan begins at tomorrows town 
meeting. By extending an invita
tion to students to attend, the ad
ministration has given them a 
unique opportunity  to provide 
input on the Universitys vision 
for campus development.
The town meeting will also help 
demystify the nature and purpose 
of the master planning initiative. 
While many students may have 
heai'd of the master plan, few un
derstand what it actually is and 
what it means to the Universitys 
future. At the meeting, representa
tives from Ayers/Saint/Gross will 
present backgroundinformation on 
the campus planning process in 
general, and University architect 
Paul Tellers will talk about the 
history of CMUs campus specifi
cally. Its important for current stu
dents to be aware of both the pro
cess and the specifics of CMUs 
master plan because of its long
term effects on the campus.
Chances for long-term planning 
have only presented themselves a 
few times in the Universitys his
tory. But now, students have the 
opportunity to get involved in some
thing that will guide campus devel
opment well into the 21st century. 
Students should take advantage of 
this opportunity by voicing their 
opinions. In doing so, they will lit
erally shape the future of CMU.
Fence painters must 
respect CMU tradition
The Fence is a CMU tradition, 
and should be treated with respect. 
It is a medium of self-expression; 
traditionally, a few hardy students 
would sit by it from nightfall to 
midnight, painttheir message, and 
guard it until daybreak to prevent 
another group from painting over 
it in the meantime. The next night, 
another handful of students would 
then take the Fence andpainttheir 
own message. But the software com
pany Trilogy was recently allowed 
by a group on campus to advertise 
a recruitment meeting on the Fence. 
Since the Fence is not a commer
cial entity, letting an off-campus 
commercial entity advertise on it is 
equivalent to defiling an important 
part of the campus.
Although this group captured 
and held the Fence according to 
the rules, painting an advertise
ment for a company on the Fence 
is in poor taste. The Fence is in
tended as a place for CMU stu
dents  not visiting companies  
to display a message of their choos
ing, from a simple happy birth
day to an advertisement for an 
upcoming event. Groups have the 
right to paint whatever they want 
on the Fence, but in the future, 
they should exercise more discre
tion in deciding what to paint on it.
Because the Fence is located in a 
prominent place  the center of 
campus  it should be one of the 
most aesthetically pleasing por
tions of CMU. However, make
shift shelters have been con. structed recently by groups at
tempting to hold the Fence for
extended periods. These structures 
give the area around the Fence an 
aura of shabbiness.
The structures also go against 
the spirit of taking and guarding 
the Fence, which is one of selfsacrifice to make sure your mes
sage lasts until morning. The Fence 
has recently been the exclusive 
property of large groups. These 
groups should be applauded for 
their willingness and ability to 
gather the manpower and desire to 
capture and keep the Fence for 
extended periods of time. However, 
holding the Fence for weeks at a 
time prevents individuals and small 
groups from using it as a means of 
self-expression. Although these 
groups are fully within the rules for 
holding the Fence, they monopo
lize what has historically been 
known as a medium of expression 
for all students on campus. At the 
same time, however, smaller groups 
that wish to take the Fence should 
make more of an effort to do so 
when it becomes available. Other
wise, the message that is sent to 
first-year and prospective students 
is that the Fence is exclusively for 
the use of organizations to adver
tise events, as opposed to being 
something that anyone with the 
initiative can paint.
The Fence and the area around it 
are an integral part of Carnegie 
Mellon University. They ought to 
be respected and shared for the 
enjoyment of all. Certainly, no prac
tice should make the Fence a mere 
commercial asset, or should make 
it an unattractive object.

James Mojonnier/Tartan Art EditorInhumane U.S. oppression crushes Iraq
Neil Babra
I recently saw the movie Three Kings, 
which is set in Iraq soon after the close 
ofthe GulfWar. The plot involves Ameri
can soldiers who hatch a plan to steal 
gold that the Iraqis looted from Kuwait. 
In the opening se
quence, a confused 
American shoots the 
head off an Iraqi sol
dier waving a signal 
of surrender  this 
sets a key tone. In its 
course, the film lever
ages several criti
cisms against United 
States policy and ide- iwmmiwjiwuHii 
ology. The moral questions are put in 
their barest terms: Do business inter
ests justify bombing a baby in his crib? 
We learn that Bush urged the people of 
Iraq to rebel against their dictator, but 
then reversed his support, leading to the 
slaughter of the dissidents. The charac
ters come to the conclusion that its wrong 
to call an Arab a sand-nigger, but 
towel-head is okay. We see the Rodney 
King beating playing on a looted televiwho better to play the American invad
ers than an ER doctor, a gangsta rap
per, and the Calvin Klein poster-boy?
I thought it was a great movie, but the 
obligatory closure of the ending left 
me feeling a little let down. Though 
much of the films criticism remains 
poignant, its main message seems to be 
look at the terrible things we did, rather 
than look at the terrible things were 
doing right now, quite in the vein of 
recent movies about the Holocaust. The
sion set. Who has the sicker society? And
Is the U.S. now truly concerned about 
the welfare of the Kurds? If so, why does 
it support and sell arms to Turkey, a NATO 
member with an atrocious human rights 
record against its Kurdish population?
simple fact is that our tragic and im
moral state of war with Iraq is not over 
by any means.
The economic sanctions effected 
against Iraq since 1991 have caused an 
incredible humanitarian disaster. The 
number of people directly killed by the 
sanctions is approaching two million, 
with about six thousand children dying 
every month and a quarter of all chil
dren malnourished, according to 
UNICEF. The World Health Organiza
tion has revealed that the majority of 
the countrys population is subsisting on 
a semi-starvation, protein-deficient diet. 
Furthermore, the United Nations ad
mits that Iraq has one of the highest 
infant mortality rates in the world, with 
about a quarter of all births being lowweight. With no way to rebuild the infra
structure, raw sewage runs through 
streets and inside hospitals, while at 
most 41 percent of the country5s popula
tion has access to clean water. The de
pleted uranium am
munition used in the 
war has left behind a 
high incidence of can
cer (which has gone up 
tenfold in children) 
and birth defects. Be
cause of the U.S.-led 
embargo, it is illegal 
to send aid of any kind 
to the Iraqi people. 
What are the conditions for lifting the 
sanctions? The Clinton administration 
is not specific. It only makes statements 
about sending a message to Iraq.
The sanctions existence is generally 
known, though their consequences may 
not be. In addition, the U.S. and Great 
Britain have bombed Iraq almost every 
day since the much-publicized heavy 
strike of last December. In February,

Ineffective death penalty violates Constitution
Thaddeus Billman
The Supreme Court has decided to 
examine the constitutionality of using 
the electric chair to carry out the death 
penalty. The practice is being challenged 
based on the Eighth Amendment, which 
forbids cruel and unusual punishment. 
While the Supreme Court will only be 
examining a specific form of capital pun
ishment, I maintain that it is not justifi
able in any form. In order for capital 
punishment to be justified, it must be 
applied only to the guilty 
and it must deter crime.
Is the death penalty ap
plied only to the guilty? Sta
tistics indicate that it is not.
Since 1973, 82 people have 
been released from death 
row because of evidence of 
their innocence. This num
ber may not seem signifi
cant, but actually it is, con- ****** 
sidering how seldom the death penalty 
is applied. Furthermore, careful exami
nation of these cases shows that a large 
portion of the evidence was only re
vealed by outside sources. In other words, 
the legal system failed to prove their 
innocence on its own. Yes, one might 
argue, but those people were released, 
so the system works. Wrong! A recent 
study found that 23 people who were 
put to death could now be proven inno
cent by newly discovered evidence. Fur
thermore, in the eyes of some judges 
there remains doubt in many other cases. 
Former Florida Supreme Court justice 
Gerald Kogan said in the Washington 
Post last December, There are several 
cases where I had grave doubts as to the 
guilt of a particular person.
Does capital punishment deter crime? 
It is often argued that the errors of 
capital punishment can be justified be
cause the penalty saves more innocent 
lives than it takes. For the sake of argu
ment, I will assume that this position 
would be just if it were true. So the 
question is, does it really stop murder? 
To address this question, I will examine 
some statistics. The South repeatedly 
has the highest murder rate (8.4 per 
10,000 people) of any region, despite 
using the death penalty to the greatest 
extent, while the Northeast, which uses 
the penalty the least, has the lowest 
murder rate (4.8 per 10,000 people). In 
addition, when one compares pairs of 
neighboring states in which one utilizes
The law states that no motive 
makes killing right.... Saying 
that capital punishment is just 
is akin to saying that the sys
tem is above its own laws."
the death penalty and the other does 
not, the state without the death penalty 
repeatedly has a lower murder rate. For 
example, Missouri (death penalty state) 
has a murder rate four times that of 
Iowa (no death penalty). A recent survey 
of police officers found that over two 
thirds do not believe capital punish
ment has any deterring effect on crime. 
Furthermore, they ranked capital pun
ishment dead last in deterring violent 
crime, as a mere 1 percent believed it to 
be the most effective method. Crimi
nologists, who should have a better idea 
than anyone else, agree. According to a 
recent survey, over 80 percent do not 
believe that capital punishment is a 
proven deterrent to homicide. Further
more, over 75 percent do not believe that
capital punishment would deter crime 
even if the time spent on death row were 
reduced and the number of executions 
were increased. There is no evidence to 
suggest that capital punishment dis
courages crime.
If anything, the death penalty appears 
to increase the murder rate! For ex
ample, a study found that the annual 
rate of homicide in California increased 
twice as rapidly during years when an 
execution took place than the years in 
which one did not. Another study done 
on New York found that, on average, 
more murders took place in the month 
following an execution than in the month 
following an execution-free month.
In light of the evidence against it, why 
do so many people support the 
death penalty? I believe it is a 
combination of hate and igno
rance. Understandably, people 
hate the murderer and believe 
he or she deserves death. This 
hatred often leads to the blind 
belief that the penalty prevents 
future crime. However, hatred
_____ is not a just reason for any action, including murder. Further
more, the idea of capital punishment is 
highly hypocritical. The law states that 
no motive makes killing right, while 
capital punishment states that killing is 
okay as long the motive is good. Saying 
that capital punishment is just is akin 
to saying that the system is above its 
own laws.
Capital punishment punishes the innocent, while failing to prevent murder. 
It is hypocritical and argues that the 
systems laws do not apply to capital 
punishment. Because it is based solely 
on the primitive desire for revenge, it is
completely unjustifiable.
Thaddeus Billman believes that he is 
always correct; however, he welcomes all 
attempts to prove otherwise.

Medicine must stop sexual exploitation of pigs
LaRita Y. Hamilton
It has come to my attention 
that a group of Canadian medical 
researchers has found that pig 
semen is the perfect protein for 
certain types of medication. I find 
this quite disturbing. I recall from 
numerous National Geographic 
films that humans are the only 
animals that engage in sexual 
acts because they like it. Granted, 
I one heard a rumor that whales 
do something similar to mastur
bating with rocks, but we cant 
ask them about it, so we may 
never be sure. If they are mastur
bating, more power to them. They 
are Freeing Willy by their own 
choice and are not being manipu
lated into it by humans.
I am not a veterinarian, nor am 
I a zoologist, but Im going to go 
out on a limb and dare to say that 
pigs do not spontaneously ejacu
late. The researchers who have 
been analyzing the makeup of 
pig sperm have also failed to wit
ness such a phenomenon, so they 
have trained the pigs to mate
with and ejaculate into special 
benches. The researchers have 
manipulated the reproductive 
cycles of pigs in order to accom
plish the feat.
Admittedly, I have never 
sat down and pondered my 
feelings about animal test
ing for medicinal purposes, 
but for some reason, this in
formation stood out to me. 
First, I thought, why pigs? 
Why not humans? Humans 
can voluntarily give semen. 
However, pigs ejaculate in 
copious amounts (about one 
cup at a time) so they are 
highly desirable. Other ani
mals, such as cows, have been 
used, but pigs reign supreme 
in the lab because of their 
quick gestation period.
This sounds like a sex slave 
camp for animals. Humans 
are often forced into situa
tions where they are sexu
ally exploited. It seems to me 
that the same thing is hap
pening to these animals. 
Sadly, life is not a Disney 
film. Animals do not speak, 
and thus we cannot ask them 
how they feel. Because they 
have not given consent and can
not give it, using them as semen
factories is sexual assault. I 
would not place this behavior on 
the same level as the child sex 
industry that takes place in many

great tastes meant for CMU

________Rebecca S. Fribush
Stop me if youve heard this 
whine before. As the end of the 
semester draws near, all of your 
classes mysteriously turn into 
project courses, and all of these 
projects somehow are supposed 
to involve PowerPoint presenta
tions and extensive research at 
some library out in the suburbs 
that refuses to open its doors to 
you more than two days a week. 
Youre getting tired and your grip 
on sanity is slowly coming un
glued. The only way you can pos
sibly handle it all is by filling 
yourself to capacity with Moun
tain Dew while youre doing the 
work, then hitting the beer like 
crazy once Friday night finally 
comes around.
Relax. Hope is in sight. A re
cent study from the University of 
Texas shows that, if nothing else, 
the CMU lifestyle at least has 
some unexpected health benefits. 
The study found that, when given 
to rats who have just suffered 
strokes, a caifeine-alcohol combo 
cuts the expected brain damage 
by as much as 70 percent.
Yeah, at first glance, this ex
periment may not appear to be 
immediately applicable to CMU 
students. But all you have to do is 
think about it for a while to see 
just how much the study relates 
to us. First of all, is there really 
much difference between a lab 
rat and your typical CMU stu
dent? Both of us spend lots of 
time in little cages while people 
with PhDs scrutinize our every 
move, hoping that, if we only work 
hard enough, a food pellet will 
magically drop down from above.
Popular magazines frequently 
publish pithy articles explaining 
the composition of human sperm. 
These scientists have explored 
the composition of pig 
semen, so why, I ask, 
cant they syntheti
cally reproduce the 
protein they need for 
the medication? I am 
sure that the cost 
would be equal to or 
lesser than the price 
of training pigs to 
have sex with inani
mate objects.
Before the scien
tists invented this 
convenient spermcollecting bench, they 
probably had to ob
tain the semen by 
other means. Whales 
masturbate (maybe), 
and humans mastur
bate, but pigs have 
hooves, and if they 
are in a lab, they re
ally arent in a posi
tion to get inventive. 
Jamie Divine/Tartan Art Staff g0me poor lab assiscountries, but the justification tant or underpaid intern had to 
that it is just an animal is a manually extract the semen from 
weak excuse for the sexual ex- the pigs. This strikes me as ex
ploitation of animals. tremely unnatural.
If pigs and only pigs are neces
sary to begin to compose a syn
thetic protein, scientists should 
take a cell sample and start there. 
Keeping pigs specifically for the 
purpose of harvesting their se
men is wrong. If scientists can 
clone sheep and make other sci
entific advancements, they 
should be able to replicate semen 
(any variety) in a laboratory.
This sounds like a case of sheer 
laziness on the part of the scien
tists. Violating nature in order to 
avoid having to start from scratch 
illustrates the medical research
ers unwillingness to work. They 
already have the information 
about what proteins they need, 
so they may not need anything 
else to help them develop a suit
able synthetic protein. It has prob
ably been done countless times 
already, but scientists can stop 
what theyre doing and start from 
the beginning. The pigs will ap
preciate it, and so will their pro
spective mates.
LaRita Y. Hamilton is a sopho
more creative writing major who 
is now grappling with her feel
ings about animal testing. While 
she no longer eats meat, she used 
to love bacon.
The major distinction between 
students and lab rats seems to be 
that the rats dont have to pay for 
the privilege of being allowed into 
their cages.
Stroke-induced brain damage 
cant be that far from brain dam
age gotten from, say, an OS check
point. Perhaps people should 
start carrying flasks of whiskey 
into the cluster along with the 
ubiquitous cans of Jolt. Im imag

and Coke. Stressed from pulling 
a thesis for that history 10- 
pager out of so much thin air? Try 
50 mg of Kahlua swirled into 100 
mg of coffee.
Besides suggesting remedies 
that might give CMU students 
incentives to look forward to medi
cal trauma, the Texas study pro
vides an actual lesson. When the 
rats were given just caffeine, they 
showed no improvement. When 
they were given just alcohol, they 
actually got worse  to ward off 
brain damage, they needed both 
substances. Loading up on caf
feine to pull homework-based allnighters for days on end without 
a release will just drive you crazy. 
But too much alcohol and not 
enough caffeine mean that you 
probably cant stay awake and 
fully conscious long enough to get 
out of this school.
Before the study means much,' 
though, there need to be wider 
trials, preferably involving 
people, not rats. Any volunteers?

there are alternatives for keep

the powers in control may 
use military force without the 
consent of the American people 
for whatever reasons they

Gators-Dawgs: a rivalry for the millenium
Between The Uprights
by Pete Patterson
When thinking of the biggest rivalries 
in college football, several games come 
to mind. Michigan-Ohio State. ArmyNavy. Notre Dame-USC. After the events 
I witnessed this weekend, I would have 
to place Georgia-Florida in the same 
category as the aforementioned grudge 
matches. I was lucky enough to be able 
to travel to Jacksonville and watch The 
Worlds Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party, 
thanks to a friend at UGA with an extra 
ticket and some frequent flier miles. 
What does this game, relatively unknown 
to those of us from Big Ten or Big East 
country, have to offer? Quite a lot, as I 
found out.
The most unique aspect of the game is 
the fact that it is played on a neutral site 
every year. This gives the game a differ
ent atmosphere than the traditional 
home and home setup. Alltel Stadium, 
home of the NFLs Jacksonville Jag
uars, was split exactly down the middle.
Florida fans were on one side of the 
stadium, Georgia on the other. The con
trast between the sea of red worn by 
Bulldog fans and the blue and orange of 
the Gator backers is something to be
hold. At any point in the game, I could 
look to my right and see 40,000+ people 
screaming Gator bait while doing the 
Chomp, then look to the left and hear 
another 40,000+ barkinglike dogs. Were 
the game to be held on either of the 
schools home turf, the visiting fans 
would no doubt be sparsely scattered 
throughout the high reaches of the sta
dium. The neutral site takes away the 
edge gained by this home field advan
tage and gives the game a Super-Bowllike atmosphere.
What gives these teams such home 
field advantages in the first place is the 
fans, who may be the wildest in the 
country. Despite a steady rain during 
the first half of the game, the crowd was 
absolutely rocking. An undergraduate 
from Michigan sitting with me was 
amazed by the intensity of the crowd, 
saying that the fans at the annual Michigan-Ohio State battle could not com
pare. I first noticed the passion of these 
fans on Friday night at The Landing, 
which is basically the Jacksonville ver
sion of Station Square. There was live 
music playing, but the main focus of the 
evening was an apparent contest be
tween Georgia and Florida fans to see 
who could cheer the loudest. A rousing 
rendition of Its great to be a Florida
Justin Sulssa/Tartan Assistant Art Editor
Gator would immediately be answered 
by Its great to be a Gator hater.
A unique setting and great fans give a 
rivalry style points, but the substance of 
the match-up is formed by the history 
between the two teams. Florida and 
Georgia first played in 1905, and have 
been battling ever since. In the present, 
the game has come to represent a lot to
each team. For the Bulldogs, it is an 
opportunity to indicate that they are 
once again a force to be reckoned with.
The Dawgs win in 97 
indicated that the pro
gram was finally begin
ning to emerge from the 
dark ages of the Ray Goff 
era of the early 90s. Jim 
Donnan has restored the 
team to an annual top15 status, but until they 
can consistently com
pete with Florida, they 
will be relegated to the 
second tier of the SEC.
For Florida coach 
Steve Spurrier, the 
game is personal. Upon 
arriving in Gainesville 
10 years ago, the offen
sive mastermind pro
claimed two goals for his 
Gator program: Be the 
best team in the SEC, 
and beat Georgia. Spurriers hate for 
Georgia began in 1966, the coachs se
nior season at Florida. In a season when 
he won the Heisman trophy and his 
team was a national title contender, the 
Bulldogs dealt Florida their only loss for 
the season. Unfortunately for Georgia 
fans, Spurrier vowed to avenge this loss 
and his been doing so ever since arriving
as coach. Entering Saturdays action, he 
was 8-for-9 against Georgia.
Adding to the attraction of this years 
game were the top ten rankings of each 
team, along with the opportunity forr 
Spurrier to become the fifth coach to 
ever guide a team to 100 wins in a 
decade. ESPN deemed the game large 
enough to send Gameday, its traveling 
pregame show, to Jacksonville. CBS 
broadcast the game to a national televi
sion audience. What transpired was a 
microcosm of the rivalry. Georgia played 
a competitive game, and was apparently 
on the brink of taking the lead early in 
the fourth quarter when they had the 
ball on the Florida 16 down only 1614. 
However, running back Jaspar Sanks 
fumbled away the ball on the next play, 
and Florida wasnt challenged again. 
The Gators added a couple of scores for 
a 30-14 win that was much closer than 
the score indicated. So, Georgia played 
well, but was still unable to get over the 
hump of the Gators and join the nations 
elite. Steve Spurrier obtained his 100th 
career win against his most hated rival 
and won the annual match-up for the. 
ninth time out of 10 tries in the 90s. ,

Play Ball
by Matt Brun
Boy, what an exciting World 
Series that was, wasnt it? Im 
actually glad it was so short. The 
less I had to watch my two least 
favorite teams battle for the 
meaningless title of Team of the 
90s the better. Anyway, I prom
ised Id write something about 
the Series, so here it is.
The Yankees completely out
classed the Braves for the second 
time in four years. Whoop-deefreaking-doo. Im not even sure 
the Braves knew the series was 
going on by the time it was over. 
If only the rest of us could have 
been so lucky. That, of course, 
would have been way too much to 
ask in the media-controlled world 
of professional sports.
There, I covered the Series. 
Happy now? I cant stand to write 
another sentence about that team 
that wins all the time, so Im 
going to conclude this seasons 
final installment of Play Ball with 
a critique of Major League 
Baseballs All-Century Team.
I think the thing I like most 
about the All-Century team is 
that for all their great history 
and legendary players, the Yan
kees have only five players on the 
30-man roster (Roger Clemens is 
on as a member of the Red Sox, 
and anyone that says otherwise 
obviously didnt watch him pitch 
this past year). Thats still more 
than any other single team, but 
at least the entire roster didnt 
wear pinstripes. One thing I do 
know, though, is that the fans 
shouldnt have had any part of 
choosing the players who received 
this extreme honor. Fan voting, 
like is done for the All-Star teams 
every year, reduces the competiYou'd better get that ideaout of your head!

tion to a popularity contest, which 
is why Ken Griffey Jr. will be an 
All-Star until he dies, and man
aged to sneak onto the All-Century team, too (more on him later).
Rather than go over each player 
in detail, Im going to limit my 
main analysis to the voted start
ers, plus other notables that de
serve extra men
tion. Ah, who am 
I kidding? The op
portunity to talk 
about the great
est players of all 
is way too good to 
pass up.
Pitchers
Nolan Ryan and 
Sandy Koufax 
were voted the 
two starters, and 
you arent going to 
hear any argu
ments from me. I 
once heard those 
two players de
scribed as the only 
pitchers who had 
the potential to 
throw a no-hitter 
every time they 
stepped on the 
mound. If that 
doesnt define a 
dominant pitcher,
I dont know what 
does. The amaz
ingly small num
ber of Ryan crit
ics in the world point to his some
what high ERA and low win to
tal, but, oddly enough, never bring 
up the fact that he played for 
some lousy teams. I dont care 
how high his ERA was, the guy 
threw seven no-hitters in his ca
reer. As an intimidation factor 
alone, that earns him a spot on 
the roster.
While were talking about domi
nant pitchers, there are a couple 
of guys on the rest of the list that 
deserve some mention, too. You 
want single season dominance, 
look at Walter Johnsons num
bers from 1913. Over the entire 
season, Johnson posted a record 
of 36-7 with an ERA of 1.14. 
Considering how much emphasis 
is'placed on winning a mere 20 
games now, this is an incredible 
feat, even back in a pitcher-domi
nated era.
Catchers
This may be the hardest posi
tion to call in terms of who should 
be the starter. Johnny Bench and 
Yogi Berra both played for some 
great teams, and both were the 
greatest catchers of their eras. 
Berra probably gets more press 
duetohavingplayedinNewYork, 
and everyones heard at least one 
of his famous quotes, but on the 
field, the edge has to go to Bench. 
Both were outstanding fielders, 
and called games exceptionally 
well, but Bench was one of the
best hitters on the Big Red Ma
chine as well.
First Basemen 
This is a big case where fan 
voting gets to me. If home run 
records were all that mattered, 
Roger Maris would be on the ros
ter, but since he isnt, why is 
Mark McGwire? I love the big
Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff 
guy as much as the next person, 
but there were definitely more 
complete first basemen to have 
played the game. Fortunately for 
the world, Big Mac didnt beat 
out the Iron Horse for the start
ing spot. As a point of reference,
Lou Gehrig is one of three Yan
kees players I dont hate on prin
ciple (the other two being Berra 
and George Herman Ruth), which 
is a pretty impressive feat. Possi
bly more impressive than that 
consecutive game streak thing.
Second Basemen
As far as the starter goes, this 
position is a no-brainer. What 
Jackie Robinson did was quite 
possibly the only event in sports 
history that cannot be over-hyped.
If he had quit in the middle of his 
rookie year, baseball would likely 
be a very different sport today.
The backup position is just as 
easy to justify. Rogers Hornsby 
led the National League in bat
ting average, slugging percent
age, and on-base percentage from 
1920 through 1925. Easily one of starter, but Aaron should be in
out the Streak. Too bad hardly 
anyone remembers them.
Third Basemen 
Brooks Robinson won 16 Gold' 
Glove awards. Thats good enough - 
for me. Todays offense-happy 
fans may demand more, but its " 
nice to know that some peoplestill respect defense, too. As for7 
the starting'- 
vote, Im justsurprised he fin
ished so close to 
Mike Schmidt.
Schmidt fits 
squarely in with 
Hark Aaron and 
Willie Mays in 
the discussion : 
over who the i 
greatest basej* 
ball player of all,j 
time is (pitchers 1 
are sadly ex^IJ 
eluded from this 
discussion in 
many fans 
minds). Over the 
course of his 
career with 
the Phillies, 
Schmidt won 
nine consecutive 
Gold Gloves, 
three MVPs, 
and led the? 
league in field-' 
ing percentage," 
put outs, RBIs,1 
and home runs" 
multiple times. If he had batted 
,300 even once, he would be a lock 
for the greatest player ever. 
Outfielders 
Is Ken Griffey Jr. a great out
fielder? Sure. Is he one of the best 
in the game today? Absolutely. Is 
he the best active outfielder?;; 
Maybe. Is he in the same class as 
Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank 
Aaron, Mickey Mantle, Ty Cobb, 
Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, 
and Stan Musial? Dont make 
me laugh.
I am so sick of hearing about 
Griffey that I treat references to 
him like the average commercial 
 it doesnt even register any
more. Including him on the AllCentury roster while excluding 
Jimmy Foxx, Carl Yazstremski, 
and Roberto Clemente almost i 
invalidates the whole thing.
On an equally bitter note, for 
all the great things Willie Mays 
did, Hank Aaron did them even 
better. I cant really complain 
about the Say Hey Kid being i
the greatest hitting performan
ces of all time.
Shortstop 
Lou Gehrig has stats to back up 
his position on the roster with
out the streak, Cal Ripken 
doesnt. Honus Wagner and Mr. 
Cub Ernie Banks were much 
better players overall than 
Ripken, who was average withthere with him.
With that, I bid you loyal read
ers of Play Ball (there have to be 
at least five of you by now) fare- * 
well until next season.
Matt Brun couldprobably stand \ 
the Indians losses a lot better if I 
the damn Yankees would just stop

coach, Bruce Bickford, was voted 
the conferences coach of the year.
Behind Emory in third place 
was Washington University, fol
lowed by the University of Chi
cago at fourth, CMU at fifth, and 
the University of Rochester at 
sixth. All four teams were sepa
rated by a mere 12 points. Round
ing out the field in seventh and 
eighth place, respectively, were 
Cse Western Reserve Univer
sity and New York University.
While Brandeiss dramatic win 
ended CMUs two-year reign as 
UAA champions, the Tartans
were not disappointed with their 
performance Saturday. Cutler 
and Byrnes earned their second 
straight All-UAA team selection, 
and the Tartans appeared strong 
enough to finish among the top 
three teams competing at the 
Regionals in two weeks, which 
would be good enough to send 
them to the National Champion
ships on November 20, by which 
time Chin should be back in run
ning condition.
On the mens side of the meet, 
controversy ruled the day as two 
members of the NYU team faced 
potential disqualification for run
ning on the wrong side of a cone 
heading into the final sprint. Al
though the runners finished more 
than a minute and a half apart, 
they both made the same mis
take, ignoring the calls of stu
dents and officials manning the 
course that they had cut inside 
the cone, and instead continuing 
down the home stretch. The re
sult was that the first runner  
who finished alone in third place 
with nobody within ten seconds 
of him  was deemed not to have 
gained a competitive advantage 
by making the mistake and was 
not disqualified. The second run
ner, however, had been running 
in the middle of a tight pack with 
runners in front of and behind 
him and his failure to navigate 
the course as everyone else did 
was deemed less reasonable, and 
resulted in his disqualification.
This bit of side drama did noth
ing to truly alter the outcome of 
the race, which was contested 
over five up-and-down miles, in 
which Emory seemed to take the 
early lead by placing three run
ners within the top ten finishers, 
only to fall by 13 points to Wash
ington, which was paced by se
nior Tim Juliens first-place fin
ish in 24:55. CMU finished just 
six points back of Emory, followed 
by NYU in fourth, Brandeis in
fifth, and Chicago in sixth, with 
Rochester holding down seventh, 
and Case finishing eighth.
CMU garnered three All-UAA 
selections from their finishers, 
led by senior mechanical engi
neering major Kenn Oldhams 
sixth-place finish with a time of 
25:42. Seniors Bryan Meyer and 
Eric Egenoff were also selected, 
finishing within seconds of each 
other at 12th and 13th place, re
spectively. Sophomore Matt 
Dennerline just missed earning a 
spot on the squad with a 15thplace finish. The rest of the team 
seniors James Gorhan and Ryle 
Goodrich and junior Adam 
Wierman  helped power CMU 
past NYU by finishing among the 
top 33 runners.
The teams next race will be 
the Regional Championships at 
Frostburg State in Maryland in 
two weeks. By then, both teams 
should be rested and looking to 
earn another trip to NCAAs.

season. Zupon also stands among the 
top rankings in total individual scoring 
within the UAA conference. This goal 
would prove to be enough for the Tar
tans, as they rode their 1-0 lead to a 
victory. Another strong performance by 
the defense gave them their record 13th 
shutout of the year.
The CMU men then traveled to Case 
Western Reserve University for a tough 
UAA conference match-up. The game 
also marked the end of the Tartans 
regular season schedule. The match 
against Case Western was marked by 
missed offensive chances for the Tar
tans. Outshooting Case Western and 
possessing the ball for almost the entire 
game was still not enough, as the Tar
tans were held scoreless by the Spartans 
defense. Case Western could accomplish 
no better, though, as the match ended in 
yet another 0-0 tie.
This was the Tartans 13th shutout of 
the year, a figure which shatters the old 
school mark of 10. CMU has only given 
up seven goals all season, another school 
best. They also rank among the top five 
teams in the nation in shutout percent
age and in the top 20 in goals-against 
average. This years solid senior back 
line of defenders David Huryk, Sharif 
Saddiqui, Eric Hopper, and goalkeeper 
Benjamin Kartzman played superbly all 
year, forming one of the best defensive 
squads in CMU history. With the tie, the 
Tartans finished the regular season with 
a-record of 11-2-4.
'The CMU women took on Lake Erie 
College on Wednesday night in their
final home game of the season. They 
played a tough contest throughout, and 
in the end came out on top with a 2-0 
win. The Tartans dominated Lake Erie, 
and maintained possession in their half 
for most of the game. The Tartans of
fense played a tough game, producing a 
seemingly constant stream of scoring 
chances. The Lake Erie goalkeeper was 
tested early and often, being forced to 
make 24 saves on 47 CMU shots. The 
CMU defense was equally impressive, 
limiting Lake Erie to just two shots on 
goal, both of which were easily saved by 
junior goalkeeper Alex Summers.
Sophomore midfielder Gwyneth Gaul 
led off the scoring early in the first half, 
making the score 1-0. Gaul played a
solid match, racking up an impressive 
14 individual shots. Carrying the 1-0 
lead into halftime, the Tartans did not 
relent during the second half of play. 
Early in the second frame, first-year 
forward Melissa McMorrow added an
other goal to give the Tartans a 2-0 
advantage. McMorrow leads the team in 
scoring, and is having a very solid rookie 
season for the Tartans. The 2-0 lead 
would hold, and ended up being the final 
score as the CMU defense clamped down 
and denied Lake Erie any quality chances 
as the game wound down.
The win was good for the Tartans, as it 
gave them some momentum for their 
last game of the year yesterday against 
Case Western Reserve University.

By MATT BRUN
Tartan Sports Editor
The CMU rowing club is well 
into their 1999 campaign, having 
competed in two major regattas. 
Based on performances so far, 
this season could turn out to be 
one of the most successful in the 
clubs history.
The club kicked off the com
petitive season by entering in the 
local Head of the Ohio Regatta, 
an annual event hosted on the 
-Three Rivers here in downtown 
Pittsburgh, on October 2. CMU 
entered four boats in the race, 
competing in the womens light
weight fours and both mens and 
womens club fours against a 
wide range of schools including 
Villanova University, the 
University of Virginia, the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh, and 
Duke University.
For their first competitive race 
of the year, the crews gave very 
impressive performances, plac
ing well in each event entered. 
The womens lightweight fours 
boat placed fourth in their event, 
finishing just 14 seconds behind 
third-place University ofVirginia. 
Villanova dominated the event, 
with their B boat taking first, 
and the A boat coming in second, 
45 seconds behind. CMU was 
one minute off the pace set by the 
leaders.
The performance was all the 
more impressive as the team fin
ished ahead of several Division I 
organizations in the 15-boat field, 
including crews from the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh, Duke, and a 
nationally ranked crew from the 
University of Wisconsin.
The other womens crew had an 
equally strong performance, 
though their efforts were not re
flected in the final rankings. Rac
ing against a much larger and 
closer-spaced 
group than the 
lightweight crew, 
the womens club 
crew finished in 
the middle of a 
large pack of teams 
and ended up with 
a final rank of 16th 
out of 29 teams.
No boat was able 
to pull away from 
the field, and. the 
top six finishers 
were all within 22 
seconds of each 
other. Winner Rob

the race leader, the third, fourth, 
and fifth-place finishers were 
separated from each other by less 
than one second, and held off the 
sixth-place crew from Pitt by an
other two seconds.
After a brief 17-second gap back 
to the seventh-place crew, the 
next three boats all finished 
within five seconds of each other. 
CMU finished just three seconds 
behind 15th-place University of 
Dayton, five seconds behind 14thplace Michigan State University, 
and was just 27 seconds away 
from a top-10 finish. Again, CMU 
was not too far off the pace, turn
ing in a time just 1:13 behind 
the leaders.
The mens club fours crews 
turned in perhaps the most im
pressive performance, with the A 
boat earning another fourth-place 
finish and the B boat finishing an 
encouraging 18th in the 19-boat
field. The A boat finished with a 
time of 14:12,1.5 seconds behind 
third-place Vassar College, and 
within striking distance of race 
winner Marietta College and runner-up University of Michigan. 
CMU was right with the leaders 
for the entire race, but was not 
quite able to make up the final 
gap, finishing just 27 seconds 
behind Marietta. The B boat fin
ished with a time of 15:58, 2:12 
back from the leader.
Following the impressive sea
son-opening performances at the 
Head of the Ohio, CMU entered 
two boats in the Head of the 
Charles Regatta in Boston last  
weekend. The trip marked the 
first time in six years that a crew 
from CMU had entered the event, 
widely regarded as the most pres
tigious event in the country for 
the fall season. The event rouPlease see CREW, page 11

Paris, London, and Tokyo are all cities that 
evoke images of foreign adventures and 
opportunities in our imaginations. Many 
people dream of traveling to far-off places, 
but few realize the educational opportunities 
that abound in traveling abroad.
Carnegie Mellon offers several different 
ways to explore the world through various 
programs such as university exchange, 
departmental exchange, study abroad pro
grams sponsored by the University, and even 
study abroad options that are not related to

Halloween allows
Less Stress?
by Emily Landes
Well, Halloween has just passed, and 
I dont know about the rest of you, but 
Im still recovering. Halloween seems 
to be the cause for more celebrations 
and debauchery in and around college 
campuses than any other national hol
iday. For some reason, you just dont 
see people getting this excited on Flag 
Day, which is sad, really, considering 
that Betsy Ross was a pretty big party 
animal for a Puritan. But anyway, 
there seems to be something about the 
prospect of Halloween that makes peo
ple a little more free, a little more like
ly to do what they never would have 
done otherwise.
A lot of that has to do with the fact 
that many people wear costumes, which 
makes them feel less accountable for 
their actions. When you are dressed up 
as someone else, you can say and do all 
the things youve ever wanted to under 
the auspices of staying in character. I 
know a guy, normally very sensitive 
and reserved, who wore an olive-green 
shirt and pants, tied a water gun to his 
back, called himself a Marine on leave, 
and went up to girls all night saying, 
How you doin?
Its not only guys who use their cos
tumes for all they are worth. In our 
society, if a girl dresses provocatively, 
she is apt to have people call her crude 
names or talk about her behind her 
back. But on Halloween you can wear 
however much, or however little, you 
want to. As a matter of fact, many girls
students to release spirits
literally dress up as whores  they 
will actually say to people, I am a 
whore  and no one will think less of 
them. Not. everyone is just a regular 
run-of-the mill whore; there are a large 
variety to choose from: waitresswhore, cop-whore, vampire-whore, 
cavegirl-whore, Britney Spears, you 
get the idea.
And its pkay, because on this one 
night of the year our consumer-crazed 
culture cuts us a break. For once, your 
clothing does not define who you are. 
Instead, the parties that you go to 
define who you are. For one single, 
solitary night on this work-obsessed 
campus, everybody is having a party. 
There are separate parties for the 
band, assorted IM teams, the art stu
dents, architecture students, drama 
students, the ccons, the student publi
cations, and, of course, the ever-pre
sent Quad. For once, everyone has 
somewhere to go.
This may be the reason that we try 
to stretch Halloween out as long as 
possible. We just cant get enough of 
this pagan celebration. Halloween 
this year fell on a Sunday, but the 
parties celebrating it actually began 
last weekend. Then there was the 
week before that when all anyone 
could ask was, What are you going 
to be? And if this year is anything 
like the two prior, we will garner 
enough stories during this holiday to 
last us through November. The 
phrase, I cant believe he/she/ 
they/we/I was so drunk that... will 
begin many of them.
Its quite a change from the innocent 
little holiday we celebrated as chil
dren, though I think that I, at least, 
looked forward to it just as much then. 
I used stencils to cut out the shapes of 
skeletons and pumpkins, pasting 
them sloppily with rubber cement on 
black construction paper. I wore my
mothers old graduation gown as a 
witchs costume. I went out trick-ortreating with my friends, making sure 
to come back before nine when, my 
mother informed me, all the crazies 
come out. I sat at the table in my din
ing room trading candy with my! 
friends and laughing at the two old' 
ladies who had attempted to give jite', 
raisins and sunflower seeds. We would 
be allowed to gorge ourselves until \ve 
were deliciously overstuffed with thte 
sweets normally kept on a shelf tob 
high for us to grab. After that night, , 
they would go back on that shelf, but 
on Halloween, they were always 
in reach.
And so, no matter what your age 
is, as long as Halloween entails thte 
prospect of stepping out of yourself, 
of the rules that you and others 
have set for you, and just generally 
acting naughty, then it will always 
be appealing.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  1 November 1999ON CAMPUS
Good schedules can benefit students
By SHION DEYSARKAR
Tartan Junior Staff writer
Students at CMU always hav^e some
thing to do. Whether its a problem set 
to finish, a lab to turn in, or a club event 
to go to, theres something to get done. 
Yet somehow, students manage to sur
vive through all of it. How? The key is 
time management. Yes, it may sound 
like a clich, but its a basic element of 
our life during and after college.
The University is addressing the 
issue in part by setting up workshops 
on time management through the 
Dimensions Series. Now in its third 
year of existence, the Dimensions serioes covers a variety of topics of interest 
for Carnegie Mellon students. One of 
the programs offered this year is Time 
Management: The Balancing Act. Pre
sented by Jennifer Church, the assis
tant dean of Student Affairs, this semi
nar focuses on how to effectively map 
out time spent during the week.
The first question asked at the pre
sentation was, If you had more time,
what would you do? People responded 
with things like catching up on work, 
spending time alone, and of course, 
sleeping. But there are barriers to get
ting more time, according to Church. 
For some students, there are obligations 
that have to be taken care of, like help
ing out at a club or meeting with people 
to work on an assignment. But for oth
ers, according to Church, the barriers 
are caused by frivolous things, such as 
checking email too much, playing music, 
and other means of getting distracted 
from work. Church said that things that 
fall in the latter category need to be kept 
to a minimum.
Next, Church handed out a sheet 
called a Time Study, which had atten
dees map out the hours they spent on 
various activities such as studying, 
sleeping, and entertainment. At the 
bottom, there was a blank for the total 
hours. No one added up to 168 hours, 
the total number of hours in a week; 
most summed to 100-150 hours. Time 
spent sleeping ranged from 30-53 
hours. According to ^urch, two things
are important in the time study: deter
mining what hours are important to 
you and determining where those miss
ing hours in the week go. Its a good 
idea to establish what hours are most 
important and what activities are most 
important to you so you can find out 
what your priorities are. Secondly, you 
should find out where your missing 
time goes so you can start to eliminate 
that wasted time.
The second activity was evaluating 
our strengths in time management. 
According to Church everyone has some 
strength in managing their lives; other
wise, students would probably end up 
lost in a sea of homework papers and 
deadlines. The three areas of strength 
are planning, organizing, and manag
ing. Based on answers to certain ques
tions, a score sheet gave a rough esti
mate of what attendees are good and 
bad at when it comes to organizing their 
lives. Church said that it is especially 
important for college students to maxi
mize our strengths. For example, peo
ple who are good at planning should
keep a planner with them so they can 
easily see their schedule. The point was 
that each individual is good at some 
kind of time management, and everyone 
needs to focus on their particular 
strength to keep them on schedule.
Many of the students who attended 
this seminar thought it was pretty 
helpful. They said they would give 
some of the techniques a try and see 
if they help. One student said, The 
general suggestions were good, [but] 
they could have been more concrete 
and that they could have given more 
specific things to do. But overall, it 
was pretty helpful. He said that he 
went to the seminar partly because 
he had some free time, and not 
because it was vitally important, but 
that he was glad he went. Another 
student said, It wasnt anything 
incredibly amazing, but most of the 
techniques were worth a try. During 
the lecture, many of the people were 
actively involved in the presentation 
and were quite focused on what the 
presenter had to say.
Contest encourages new companies
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan News Editor
Some students choose to use their 
time outside of class to work or read 
books. Others choose to start up what 
they hope will become multi-milliondollar companies.
In its first year, Enterprize, Pitts
burghs Business Plan Competition, is 
a way for students and other residents 
of Pittsburgh to win money by coming 
up with real business plans. More 
importantly, their business proposal is 
exposed to the limelight of venture cap
italists  individuals and companies 
that have the capital to invest in a 
novel idea.
Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne, and the 
University of Pittsburgh collaborated 
to organize the event. Other such pro
grams have been highly successful in 
other cities and universities. MIT, for 
example, sponsors the $50k Entrepre
neurship Competition, now in its 11th 
year.
Arepa.com was one of the participants 
in MITs competition in 1996. As of this 
year they have already secured around 
$21 million from investors, and are poised 
to offer video-on-demand over cable lines 
as soon as broadband becomes widely 
available across the country.
And this competition isnt just a 
learning experience, or practice for the 
real world. The main purpose of 
Enterprize is to re-invigorate Pitts
burghs economy, according to contest 
material.
All the pieces are here [in Pitts- million in annual revenues within 
burgh], a lot of capital... but it does not five years. Venture capitalists 
produce startups at the same rate as that are co-sponsoring the

comparable cities, said McKinsey & 
Companys Chris Dugan, head of the 
project organizing committee for Enter
prize.
Dugan said he is hoping for around 
10-15 startups to enter the competi
tion. Enterprize defines a startup as 
a company that seeks to make $20
event include Triangle Capital, the 
Heinz Endowments, and Birchmere Investments.
The competition, which had its offi
cial kick-off about two weeks ago, 
works in phases. The first phase 
included a 2-5 page business idea sum
mary that summarized the target market for the proposed business, the busi
nesss plans for generating revenue, 
and its plans for filling the need of the 
market. The six winners of the first 
phase will receive $2,500 each. The sec
ond phase includes a 15-20 page draf^, 
of a detailed business plan, with threpj 
winners awarded $10,000 each. Final
ly, next March a 20-30 page complete 
business plan will be subimitted. The 
first prize will receive $50,000 and two 
runners-up will receive
$25,000 each.
Its chump change, said Dugan. The 
real money for a startup would come 
from the venture capitalists, according 
to Enterprize contest material.
Dugan said he expects many of the 
companies proposed by CMU students 
to be technololgy-related.
One such group consists of four CMU 
students from very different back
grounds: Computer Science, Art, 
Drama, and Mathematics.
Were looking at this as a serious 
career thing, said one of the group mem
bers, Blair Erickson, a senior art major.
The group is working on an enter
tainment internet start-up company 
but wont divulge additional informa
tion for fear of compromising their 
market position. Erickson said the idea 
is unique, and therefore could make 
millions of dollars.
Currently, the four members are fig
uring out how to attract investors and 
get the project moving. Eventually, 
they will start out on the implementa
tion of their Web site.

Overseas opportunities abound 
for students in myriad programs
OVERSEAS, from page LI
financial aid package. Oftentimes, students 
are required to have taken a few foreign 
language courses for the language of their 
respective country, and only a handful of 
students may participate in the program for 
each university.
One of the exchange programs is with 
Ecole Polytechnique Federate de Lausanne 
in Lausanne, Switzerland. Engineering 
majors and all science majors except biology 
can apply to study there for a year. Anoth
er example is the exchange program with 
Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superi
ores de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. 
Here students of all majors except for Fine 
Arts can study for a semester or full year. 
There is also an exchange program with 
Keio University in Tokyo, Japan. The year
long program is open to all undergraduates, 
but since the main focus will be studying 
the culture and language of Japan, students 
may have to complete an additional semes
ter upon returning to CMU. Students may 
study at the Pontificia Universidad Catholica de Chile in Santiago, Chile. This semes
ter or full-year program is open to all 
Carnegie Mellon students. The final 
exchange university is the National Univer
sity of Singapore. Students from most
departments can apply for the yearlong or 
semester program.
Another option for studying abroad is the 
departmental exchange. Here, students in 
majors such as architecture, art, chemical 
engineering, design, and modern languages 
can study at a variety of different universi
ties in regions ranging from Europe to Asia 
to the Middle East. Interested students can 
contact their department for more informa
tion or visit the study abroad Web site.
Students may also attend other non-CMU 
sponsored programs by having the program 
approved by their department for credit. 
Students may also participate in universitysponsored programs after which they pay 
through Carnegie Mellon.
Last spring, Denise Morales, a senior biol
ogy and Spanish double major, attended the 
Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superi
ores de Monterrey (ITESM) in Monetrrey, 
Mexico. In the academic sense, ITESM was 
able to provide me with an excellent 
biotechnology research opportunity and the 
Spanish I needed to complete my double 
major, she said. While studying, Morales 
not only gained knowledge, but also friends, 
both Mexican and American, a host family, 
research connections, and a desire to wrap 
anything I eat in a tortilla. Morales said
she treasures her semester spent out of the 
country. I would highly recommend study: 
ing abroad to anyone. Living in Mexico, 
stripped of all that was familiar, forced me 
to discover exactly who I am as an individ
ual, she said.
The Study Abroad offices Web site says, 
Its never too early to study abroad. The 
earlier the better: You can organize your 
Carnegie Mellon course requirements 
around your study abroad if necessary. 
Students must also attend 
information/orientation that address 
medical concerns, academic issues, living 
abroad, cultural adjustments, and 
returning to the U.S.
Students receive email that updates them 
on what is happening on campus while they 
are gone and are encouraged to take place 
in the Study Abroad Photo Contest and 
Artifact Show the semester following their 
experience.
While you are abroad, you may want to 
start taking pictures and looking for arti
facts that represent your experience to 
you. When I was abroad, I always loved 
the different packaging and signs or a 
particular salt shaker in the shape of a 
pig, said Eva Mergner, director of 
Study Abroad.Curiosity, concerns prompted search 
of Yale dormitory masters computer
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (UWIRE)/ Yale Daily News  The 
Yale computer administrator 
who compiled evidence leading 
to the eventual arrest of former 
Saybrook Master Antonio 
Lasaga said he pursued his 
investigation out of curiosity 
and fear.
If the administrator, Paul 
Gluhosky, undertook his investi
gation at the polices prodding, 
Lasagas attorney is arguing 
in federal court that the evi
dence that Lasaga downloaded 
and stored child pornography 
should be thrown out, since 
its gathering would have 
amounted to an unwarranted 
police search of the former Say
brook masters property.
Gluhosky and geology grad
uate student Victor Sletten, 
who alerted police to the sus-i
iicious activity, spoke publicly 
or the first time about their 
discovery Tuesday at a hear
ing in a Hartford federal 
courtroom. The pretrial hear
ing was held to determine 
whether the court would allow 
into evidence material gath
ered in Saybrook College. The 
search warrant for Saybrook 
was issued based on the evi
dence Gluhosky supplied to 
the Yale Police.
If Judge Alvin Thompson 
rules that Gluhosky was work
ing for the police when he moni
tored Lasagas computer usage, 
the judge could suppress all evi
dence gathered in Saybrook, 
potentially shattering the gov
ernments case.
Lasaga was indicted in June 
on federal charges of possessing 
and receiving two videotapes 
and thousands of images of child 
pornography stored on comput
ers and disks. He also faces 
state sexual assault charges of 
molesting a 13-year-old New 
Haven boy; that trial is on hold 
until the federal proceedings 
are completed.
After two graduate students 
noticed suspicious files on
as UNIX-based comput
er in the geology lab, 
they notified Gluhosky, 
now a systems programmer 
in Information Technol
ogy Services.
Once he was alerted to the 
potential misuse of the school 
network, Gluhosky wrote a pro
gram that monitored Lasagas 
computer usage. Gluhosky testi
fied that he noticed that Lasaga 
downloaded pornographic images 
on his office computer and later 
transferred them to his home 
computer in Saybrook College.
I was scared. I was trying to 
keep my mind on other things, 
Gluhosky said in court, accord
ing to the New Haven Register. 
However, when I would see 
Tony walking down the hall, I 
was curious. Was he doing 
it again?
Sletten, one of the graduate 
students, said in court that he 
had lost sleep over the disturb
ing discovery.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kari
Dooley, who is prosecuting the 
case, would not comment 
Wednesday on whether she 
thought the motion would pass 
or how damaging it would be to 
her case if the evidence were 
thrown out.
Neither Gluhosky, Sletten, 
nor Lasagas attorney William 
Dow would speak about the 
case Wednesday.
The hearing will continue in 
late November when the 
remaining witnesses can travel 
to Hartford. The judge will then 
rule on the motion and set a 
trial date.
New Barcelona 
program shines
PROMISES, from page LI
The other four faculty mem
bers involoved are Mark 
Mentzer, professor and associ
ate dean of design; Cindy 
Limauro, associate professor of 
drama; Susanne Slavick, pro
fessor of art; and Franco Sciannameo, artist lecturer in music 
and spokesperson for the 
group. Their goal is to take 30 
students from Carnegie Mellon 
to Barcelona to work with 
20-30 students in the ELISAVA School.
Although the program was 
developed within the College of 
Fine Arts, they are not just 
looking for artists, according to 
Lee. We are also very hopeful 
to enroll students campuswide who may not otherwise 
have time to study the arts 
during the regular academic 
year but will definitely benefit 
and contribute enormously to 
the program, said Lee.
Barcelona was picked for 
many reasons. Sciannameo 
described the city as provin
cial, with a local feeling, yet it 
remains a major port and cul
tural center. Barcelona is a 
provocative site in which to 
explore and test boundaries, 
between disciplines, lan
guages, and frames of refer
ences, between the local and 
the global, he said.
It is also the home of the 
school with which CMU is col
laborating on this pilot pro
gram. The ELISAVA School 
has a total of 1,200 students 
studying in three main areas: 
communication design, indus
trial design, and interior 
design. CMU faculty and stu
dents will be working with 
ELISAVA students and faculty, 
including a historian/musi-. 
cian, a writer, a communica-' 
tions designer (who happens to 
have acquired his masters 
degree in communications 
design from Carnegie Mellon)*,; 
an architect, and a multi-! 
media/sound specialist. Their, 
proposed investigations will 
involve the effect of sound and 
light in the environment on an 
urban population, modes of 
communication as they pertain 
to sharing the rich history and 
culture of a city with a 
variety of audiences, and stud
ies of forms, space, materials, 
color, and texture and their j 
cultural specificity.
As with any foreign experi
ence, one will learn just as 
much about ones self and ones 
own culture as one will about 
the foreign culture one is 
immersed in, said Slavick. 
This is an opportunity to be 
exposed to the languages of the 
arts, to actually utilize and 
apply them to urban situations 
and problems, to integrate 
them with ones own expertise. 
Right now the involved facul
ty are working on setting up 
explicit student admission cri
teria so that there will be no 
misunderstandings about 
what the program is trying to* 
accomplish. Screening will be 
required for those who are 
applying. Each student will 
need to prove their problem
solving and social skills, and to 
submit a visual or written 
work and a letter of recommen
dation from a faculty member 
who knows their work.

Halloween is a special time of year, 
where we remind each other of our love, 
so tell your dad, "Hey dad, thanks for 
carrying in that firewood, I love you." 
And if you live in a loving home, he'll 
reply "I love you too son/daughter, you 
are the apple of my. eye, happy Halloween.
Well things in my friend Socko's house 
aren't so P.C. "Fuck you son, I carry that 
wood in to warm my toes and hopefully 
roast your gasoline soaked, mamby-pamby 
corpse some day!" Socko used the same 
line he always uses "C'mon baby, light my 
fire!" and then he ran up to cry in bed.

Socko was having the time of his life, his 
mind seeping down the river of blah-blah. 
In his drugged haze he managed to 
seriously wound his father with the aid 
of a chainsaw, the gasoline fumes wafting 
throughout the house adding a magical 
scent to that festive Halloween night.
As Socko lay in bed pouring his tattered 
little heart onto his He-Man pillow, a

the window. "Don't cry poor Socko, my

Volume 94, Issue 9The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania1 November 1999
Scott Kaufman (I), Renu Parmar, and Christina Martos (r) starred in the production of Dialogue of the Carmelites.Students give exquisite portrayal of Poulenc opera
By BALAJI SARPESHKAR
Tartan Staffwriter
When one thinks of opera, one gener
ally considers the singers on stage to be 
the only important aspect of the show. 
While the cast of an opera is vital to its 
success, for obvious reasons, there are 
also many other elements that define 
; opera and set it apart from other-performing arts. The work that is done 
I offstage, as well as the story and music, 
are all things that give opera 
its identity.
One of the most important aspects of 
an opera performance is the work that 
goes on behind the scenes. A great deal 
of work goes into designing the sets and 
backdrops of a show. Unlike other forms 
of *theater that might feature a some
what more sparse set design, the nature 
of opera demands that its sets 
be extravagant.
Opera is like exploded musical the
ater, said Aaron Mastin, a first-year 
design major. Everythingis just bigger, 
more exaggerated.
Usually, production of all the sets and 
technical elements of an opera can take 
up to two full weeks. However, it can 
take a lot longer for the cast to prepare
for a show. Generally, the cast of a pro
duction will spend close to five or six 
weeks rehearsing for a show. Just as 
in a musical, the singers need time to 
learn the songs, which are often written 
and performed in foreign languages.
However, a lot of time is also spent on 
things such as the behavior and ges
tures of the singers. Because opera 
has no spoken parts, the singers
must act in a way 
that makes 
the
all art this page by 
Alissa Taylor/Tartan Art Staff
audience believe that singing is the only 
legitimate form of communication.
There needs to be a way of behaving 
that is appropriate to an environment in 
which people sing in beautiful ways, 
said Gregory Lehane, associate 
head of the school of drama.
One of the most noticeable differ
ences between opera and 
other forms of theater is the 
music. While both musical 
theater and opera rely on 
an orchestra to supply 
the music, the styles of 
music that are played 
are usually drastically 
different. Opera is 
performed to classical 
music, while musicals tend 
to feature songs that are 
more upbeat.
Similarly, the story element of opera 
is usually different than in other 
forms of theater. Stories in opera tend 
to be rather complicated, with lots 
of sudden plot twists, supernatural 
events, and even deaths. Musical 
theater and regular theater, by 
contrast, tend to have rather different 
types of stories which differ consider
ably from the themes of opera..
Musical theater tends to be happier, 
said Marisa Dollinger, first-year design 
major. Traditional theater is usually 
smaller, more true to life.
One question that
comes to mind
ity of movies and television, 
do people really go to the opera? 
Well, with opera houses in Detroit, 
Santa Fe, and even Pittsburgh continu
ing to produce shows, one can assume 
that opera is still a popular way to spend 
time. In fact, opera seems to be gaining 
considerable popularity these days. 
New operas are being written, and some 
companies try to revive old shows, 
to give them a fresh look and hopefully
attract a new audience of opera lovers to 
the concert hall.
I believe the goal of contemporary 
opera is to make opera more 
accessible to a larger group of people, 
said Lehane.
So, while many may still opt to 
slouch in their living room re

Mond a y

ball, 
some find 
this long 
popular form 
of entertain
ment to be a 
welcome alter
native. With 
the newer operas that are currently be
ing composed, perhaps some of the ste
reotypes surrounding opera can be elimi
nated, making it an enjoyable experi
ence for everyone  not just avid 
music lovers.
By DOUGLAS A. JONES, JR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
First performed in Italian at 
La Scala in 1957, Francis 
Poulencs opera Dialogue of the 
Carmelites was performed last 
weekend by the School of Music. 
Directed by Gregory Lehane and 
under the musical direction of 
Maestro Robert Page, the rela
tively new opera began with an 
inauspicious start. Slated to 
open last Thursday, its opening 
was pushed back to Friday due 
to pieces of CFAs ceiling col
lapsing into the Hewlett Gallery 
directly adjacent to Alumni Con
cert Hall, where the opera was 
scheduled to be performed.
An opera in three acts, Dia
logue of the Carmelites is just 
that: a dialogue. It is an 
opera that abandons the tradi
tional aria or duet, instead 
utilizing the recitative 
(a vocal declamation that 
follows the inflection and 
the emotion of a text).
In the traditional sense, the 
composer uses the recitative to 
btfild an emotional life that 
culminates in an aria or duet. 
However, throughout
the duration of the opera, 
Poulencs rendition of the
famous Ave Maria Dialogue of the Carmelites by 
and Salve Regina for the most George Bernanos. The play, and 
part could be considered actual ultimately the opera, centered 
songs that could stand on their about the character of Blanche 
own right. de la Force and her psychologi
cal, spiritual, and exis
tential journey. Blanche, 
played by senior music 
major Christina Martos, 
has just about every
thing in her life: wealth, 
status, health, and fam
ily. The thing that is 
missing is her stability. 
Blanche cannot find her 
place in the world, ulti
mately resulting in a fear 
of living. (Bernanos and 
Poulenc are both work ing under the influence 
of Jean-Paul Sartre and 
existentialism. Although 
the opera is set in the 
late 18th century, the 
histrionic approach of 
the librettist is clearly 
evident in Blanches per
sonal choices). She de
cides to give up all of her 
wealth and become a 
nun, joining the order of 
the Carmelites.
Once she joins the order she is 
immediately faced with an ail
ing Mother Superior, played by 
junior music major Renu
josn rranzos
Marianna Ferris (I) and Christina Martos pay 
homage to the dead in Dialogue of the 
Carmelites.
Poulenc, who achieved fame for 
his works on piano and his ballet 
Les Biches, wanted to compose 
an opera. While searching for a 
libretto, he was taken by the play
Parmar. Parmars performance 
is outstanding. Her rich mezzosoprano voice is underlined with 
age and sickness. She immedi
ately draws you into her world, 
and her death scene is one of 
great passion and loss. Her per
formance is topped off with crisp 
diction, and even in her death 
scene we are able to understand 
every word.
After her death, Madame 
Lidoine becomes the new Prior
ess of the Carmelites. Nicole Tay
lor sings the role of the new 
Mother Superior with power and 
presence. She completely takes 
the audiences attention once she 
steps onto the stage. Her voice, in 
combination with her stage pres
ence, is a flawless match. Taylor 
is reminiscent of operatic diva 
Leontyne Price. Like Price, Tay
lor seems to have a voice that 
would be able to span the realm 
of operatic literature: from 
Carmen to Bess to Tosca (Price, 
during her glory years, performed 
the definitive interpretations of 
these roles).
Madame Lidoine leads her 
charge right into the middle of 
the French Revolution. 
After being told that all religious 
orders are to be dissolved, each 
nun takes a vow of martyrdom.
This would mean that they would 
have to face the guillotine. The 
final scene is a procession to the 
chopping block at the Place de la 
Revolution. One by one, while 
singing the Salve Regina, each 
nun takes her place on the scaf
fold and meets her doom. 
After escaping from the convent, 
Blanche pushes her way through 
the crowd and starts to sing the 
hymn with the only sister left, 
Sister Constance of St. Denis 
(played by Marianna Ferris, se
nior music major, and Laura 
Nupponen, also a senior music 
major, on alternating nights). 
Once Blanche reaches the scaf
fold and meets the guillotine, ail 
is silent and no one is left from 
the charge of the Carmelites (ex
cept for Mother Marie of the 
Incarnatio, played by junior mu
sic major Dominique Barbour, 
who escaped).
Martos gives a remarkable per
formance as the heroine, Blanche 
de la Force. She virtually never 
leaves the stage, and Poulenc 
gives no mercy to the soprano. 
Her emotional outpours seem 
like a real strain on the voice, 
but Martos appears to handle 
them with ease. Not only was 
her singing spectacular, but it 
was a treat to see her act the role
so well. She brings real life to 
Blanche; she brings a true sense 
of struggle to the stage. Her 
performance is a consummate 
blending of beautiful singing 
and acting.
The biggest disappointment 
with the School of Music produc
tion was the production value. 
ACH is not, and was not, a friendly 
space for the actors, crew, and 
audience. It is very cramped and 
tight. Also, lighting designer 
Thom Weaver, a senior drama 
major, did not create an accept
able blend of tone/mood with vis
ibility. Often, it is understood that 
the mood was somber, but it was 
difficult to see the actors faces. 
There was too much back and 
side lighting, leading to exces
sive shadows.
Finally, it was a refreshing 
change to have an opera that 
doesnt fit the traditional mode, 
as in Mozarts operas. Maestro 
Page and his orchestra did a won
derful job creating a blend with 
the vocalists, and there were some 
touching orchestral moments. 
Although Poulencs opera 
does not contain any tunes that 
the audience would leave 
humming, it does leave the audi
ence with a lot of questions about 
their spirituality and existence.Age-old musical entertainment manages to stay alive

L8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  1 November 1999Musicai advocates love despite prejudice
By JENNIFER PETRINI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Its 1906. A little boy stands 
alone onstage as a piano plays a 
sweet, melodious tune. This is 
the music ofRagtime  a story of 
passion, intrigue, and ethnic in
justice in a time not far removed.
The Benedum Center opened 
the 1999/2000 Mastercard Broad
way Series with the musical pro
duction of Ragtime. Set on the 
verge of World War I, the opening 
number brings to life the 
characters of E.L. Doctorows 
classic tale.
; First, the rich and privileged 
white society is introduced by 
posing in stunning pictures 
staged by choreographer Graciela 
Daniele. As this well-to-do upper 
class sings snobbishly of a happy 
lifestyle kept only by them, a new 
set of characters erupt victori
ously onstage. Dancing to the 
Ragtime tune are the African 
Americans, much more energetic 
and explosive than the wealthy 
WASPs. The immigrants arrive 
from the ragships, scared to be in 
a new place but ecstatic to be in 
America, the land of opportunity 
and success. As the Ragtime num
ber continues, the obstacles 
between these groups are 
distinctively portrayed by the 
staging of the scene.
More specifically, the story 
builds with the immediate con
flicts between three families. The 
rich whites, the immigrant Jews, 
and the bereaved Afri
can-Americans journey 
through the time pe
riod, learning of the 
history that permeates 
America. Leading 
these families are 
Mother, Tateh, and 
Coalhouse, each suffer
ing through their own 
choices concerning 
family and life.
While Mothers hus
band is away on a year
long trip, she finds an 
abandoned African 
American child in her 
flowerbed. After the 
childs mother is recap
tured, Mother takes 
full responsibility for 
the family and wel
comes them into her 
home. The babys fa
ther, Coalhouse, begins 
to come to the house to 
speak with the mother 
of his child, but the 
childs mother refuses, 
allowing him only to play the 
tunes of ragtime on the piano 
while she sits upstairs and lis
tens. Tateh and his daughter find 
themselves in the same situation
in New York City, however they 
are alone in their struggles to 
find work and the means to ulti
mate success.

first crime of the century. They 
provide a running commentary 
on the times and motifs as the 
story moves through the three 
families. Their roles in the musi
cal demonstrate the injustice, 
publicity, escape, and double 
standards existing in America at 
the time.
The stage was gen
erally bare, with few 
set pieces and back
drops that were 
slimmed down enor
mously from the origi
nal Broadway produc
tion, adapting the 
beautiful resonance of 
color from the lighting 
designed by famed 
Jules Fisher and Peggy 
Eisenhauer. Lighting 
took over the pictures 
created onstage, fram
ing the show and al
lowing the lower-key 
set design to flourish. 
Exquisite period cos
tumes designed by 
Santo Loquasto and 
the directorial 
excellence of
Frank Galati, not to 
mention the rich tal
ent of the cast, tied the 
show together.
Cathy Wy dner devel
oped Mother as a sym
pathetic and delicate woman. The 
power of her voice and character 
carry her successfully through 
the musical. Similarly, the come
dic anecdotes from Tateh, played
by Jim Corti, carry him through 
the story. As a character in the 
worst physical condition with a 
daughter on the brink of survival, 
he still provides his role with an 
energized desire for the better. 
His journey to the motion picture 
business is not only well-suitei| 
but also loveably admired.
Lawrence Hamilton captures 
the audience with his controver
sial role as Coalhouse, who lives 
in a society of hypocritical anarjchy and double standard^; 
He shines as the leader of th$J 
African-American rebels and r$! 
members the importance of fam
ily, life, and truth in his lyrical 
ballad, Make Them Hear You. 
Yet his son, Coalhouse III, 
steals the entire musical as 4- 
year-old Evan Blair and JoReese! 
D. King take turns running' 
onstage at its end, giving the 
audience an opportunity to laugh 
and smile at the 
heartening closeness ;oJ 
family ties.
Times changed, peoplfc 
changed, and the music changed 
as well. It is now the piano tink
ering a ragtime jingle, then 
the classical pieces of the earlier 
composers. Ethnic groups 
ruled and discriminated; 
but something more found1 ai

discovery of family, life and love:-Beautiful Italian film brims with romantic symbolism
By THADDEUS BILLMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Meet In6s Sastre, the Italian Julia 
Roberts. She can act with feeling and 
shes quite attractive. What more could 
one want in the heroine of a romance?
 The Best Man is the story of poor 
Francesca Baini. The year is 1899, and 
Francesca finds herself just days from 
an arranged marriage. Francesca is more 
than indifferent to her proposed hus
band, Edgardo; she downright despises 
him. She finds him physically unattrac
tive, and is aware of his reputation as a 
womanizer. She wants to call the whole 
felling off, but her father makes it clear 
that the family will be ruined if she does, 
so she reluctantly agrees.
' Meanwhile, a former town resident, 
Angelo Beliossi, has returned. When he 
left town he had nothing, but he has 
earned a great fortune in America. Once 
despised by the town, Angelo now has a 
million friends who all want a piece of 
his wealth, among them Edgardo. 
Edgardo is already quite rich himself, 
but, always looking for more, he wants 
to make Angelo a business partner. In 
order to build a relationship, he asks 
Angelo to be his best man.
^The wedding preparations are elabo
rate. It seems that these people have as 
many superstitions as stars in the sky
and feel a need to exercise every last one. 
Francescas crazy aunt tells her that 
she must bathe in saint water. 
Once she does this, the saints will sup
posedly watch over her. Francesca 
does this, and says that she needs
the saints to send someone to save her 
from her impending doom.
During the wedding ceremony, 
Francesca finds that savior. Once she 
sets her eyes upon Angelo, she knows it is 
him she must marry, not Edgardo. When
she says her vows, she looks only at 
Angelo, and as the movie develops, it 
becomes more and more apparent that 
she truly believes that she has married 
Angelo, not Edgardo.
The Best Man is a beautiful period ro
mance. Combin
ing dazzling imag
ery, strong acting, 
and inventive 
writing, the film 
works on a variety 
of levels. The plot 
is strong enough to 
stand on its own, 
the imagery is in
teresting, and the 
movie has plenty 
to say about love 
and life.
Francesca is a 
classical romantic 
heroine. She loves 
Angelo and noth
ing he does will 
change her mind. 
He tells her the 
truth about how 
he obtained his 
wealth and later 
leaves with an
other woman, 
saying it is best 
for everyone.
Francesca beautifully says that she is 
his forever, that she will be faithful. Her 
faith eventually pays off, as Angelo ul
timately returns. When a child asks 
him, who are you?, he replies, I am 
her husband.
The Best Man is filled with 
imagery and symbols which are mainly^ 
drawn from the close "or 
the 1800s. The century is ending andeveryone is partying, but the partyris; 
broken before midnight as Francescas 
marriage comes to a close. Symbolically^, 
the centurys turn represents the end'of 
the oppression of women. Francesca will; 
no longer be subject to the desires 
of men; she will follow her own conscience 
and exercise her own will.
While The Best Man is a good film, it 
remains far from perfect. Several of the 
subplots are introduced for no reason 
and are hardly explored, leaving the 
viewer wondering why the director 
included them in the film.
Overall, the romantic element^ 
are beautiful and the acting is 
excellent, while the visual imagery 
and frequent use of symbolism are, 
fascinating. It falls short of being a*; 
great film because of pointlessi 
subplots and rather poor character dei-i 
velopments. However, it is certainly 
worth a look for those of you who enjoy a 
good romance.

Show communicates to critic
By ALEX NEUSTEIN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Walk into The Frame, Carn
egie Mellons student-run art gal
lery, and you walk into a room 
filled with silent communication. 
The new show by student artists 
Carrie Schneider and Zak Prekop, 
entitled Image Correspondence, 
is unassumingly displayed and 
centers on the relay of 
images between the 
two artists.
In order to fully ex
plain the work, it is 
necessary to know the 
history. Over the sum
mer, Schneider and 
Prekop sent each other 
photographs and 
paintings. Based on 
these received works, 
they created re
sponse works. The re
sponse works are dis
played in the main gal
lery, with some of the 
original works in a 
smaller rear room.
Prekop and Schneider both said 
that their work was not concep
tual, but meant to be taken for 
what it literally displayed. 
Schneider displayed her own pho
tographic series. Each series com
prised a collection of small photo
graphs inside a thick, black pa
per frame. The photographs were
blurry shots of landscape rush
ing by, with Schneider herself in 
soft-focus with a blue background. 
It is important to note the appar
ent passage of time from one photo 
in a series to another. In this 
way, they seem to be key frames 
of a film.
Prekop displayed about eight 
paintings: five small works on 
one wall and three larger works

The Winslow Boy
Thursday, November 4
, David Mamet is The Man.
If you didnt see The Spanish Prisoner last semes
ter, watch it now. As a friend of mine once said, It 
Was the only movie that I went to bed thinking of, and 
woke up thinking of. You may also remember 
Glengarry Glen Ross, the finest-acted movie of the 
decade. Period. Mamet wrote the play, and eventu
ally the script, for this film starring Ai Pacino, Alec 
Baldwin, and Jack Lemmon among others.
Anyway, The Winslow Boy is a bit different than 
the above movies. For starters, it takes place in 
England about a century ago. The movie follows the 
course of a court trial and the lost love that results 
from it. Youll also find as many plot twists in this 
(ilm as there were swears in Glengarry. (The fword was used 137 times in the 100-minute movie.)

Drop Dead Gorgeous
Friday, November 5
There was once an episode of The Flintstones where 
Fred heard some coworkers talking about entering 
their babies into the Bedrock Beauty Pageant. Fred 
,asked them how to sign up. He got home and thor
oughly prepared Pebbles for the challenge up until 
'the day of the contest. However, the pageant turned 
out to be for attractive wives whose non-PC hus
bands had called them babies. Nevertheless, 
Pebbles won because she was so damn cute.
Can you honestly think of another time where such 
behavior was acceptable? Dont you just hate white
wash moms whose unfulfilled dreams are ungrate
fully placed upon the fragile shoulders of their sixyear-old daughters so that theyll win their local 
beauty pageant? Well, if so, then check out this 
 hilarious flick.

American Pie
Saturday, November 6
Momo here, kids. I have the honor of sitting in this 
week for a dear friend, Mr. No-Feet, a charming 
young man. He asked me to review a heart-warming 
family classic by the name of American Pie. To be 
honest, I had trouble relating to many of the charac
ters in this movie. The girls axe shy and timid 
virgins; the type of girl you might call a C.T., if you 
get my drift. As for those deliciously hairless teenage 
boys, I was so transfixed by their nubile bodies that 
J hardly heard a word they said. What about the 
infamous pie scene, you ask? Well, thats a trick my 
husband mastered years ago. I couldnt leave any 
fruit-filled baked goods laying around for fear wed 
have to have them a la mode, or should I say, a la 
Stan? In my opinion, the most sympathetic and 
believable character is a woman called Schifflers 
Mom. Her effortless seduction scene brought tears 
to my eyes. Brava!

viperHouse
Shed
viperHouse Records
Since forming in 1995, 
Vermonts viperHouse has 
steadily built a name for itself, 
due to both its prowess in concert 
and its association with stage 
superstar Phish. Comparisons 
are inevitable: Although its easy
going brand of swing and jazz is 
more subdued, viperHouse shares 
both Phishs flair for solos and 
jams and its insistence on keen 
musicianship. The bands latest 
effort, Shed, is a jazzy collection 
of original songs plus a few jazz 
standards thrown in for good mea
sure. Unfortunately, like so many 
successful touring acts, 
viperHouse hasnt quite trans
lated its success into an original, 
engaging record.
Numerous press clippings 
about viperHouse have praised 
the bands ability to make 
danceable jazz and inspire ex
citement in its audiences. With 
nine members, the band is free to 
explore various sonic ideas, in
cluding elements ofjazz, big band, 
funk, and a little rock n roll. 
Occasionally, like on the closing 
track Getting It and Neil
Youngs For the Turnstiles, the 
band lays down a toe-tapping 
groove and the dance floor doesnt 
seem so far away. For the most 
part, though, Shed is a downtempo affair, draggy rather than 
well-paced. Laid-back tracks like 
Give it Up and Planet incor
porate vocals into the mix. 
Frontwoman Heloise Williamss 
easygoing voice complements 
the music well, but after
four listens I cant recall a 
single lyric.
viperHouse is certainly a tal
ented actits performances have 
garnered raves from all over, and 
its members skills are without 
question. On Shed, though, there 
are simply no hooks or standout 
passages, and the notion of this 
being dancing jazz is hard to 
grasp. Perhaps if I had caught 
the bands concert this past Mon
day, the CD would have held more 
interest, but it seems more likely 
that it would have only seemed 
more disappointing.
ANDY FRANCIS
Trans-AM
Futureworld
Thrill Jockey Records
Trans-AMs latest release pre
sents an interesting mix of elec
tronic sounds. Electronic key
boards, drumming, and sounds 
of origins unknown merge to form 
a style of new-age music arriving 
perhaps before its time. Where 
Trans-AM once relied upon elec
tronic sounds as only complemen
tary to their music, such electric 
melodies have become the main 
focus of Futureworld.
Lyrics are sparse, and all hu
man voices are electronically 
modified to the point where they 
are indistinguishable from the 
background of techno rhythms. 
With song titles such as City in 
Flames and Cocaine Computer, 
one might expect emotionallycharged music beating its way 
into your head through the ear
drums. However, any sense of 
emotion within the songs is lost 
somewhere between the drum
ming of computer-programmed 
percussion, the moaning of Casio
electronics, and the often unin: 
telligible lyrics.
The album is complete witlji 
awkward moments of silence 
within tracks, and even episodes, 
of repeated beeping, comparable 
to a computer error alert.
Trans-AMs new style of music 
is not the stuff of chart-topping 
hits and is the antithesis of main
stream, at least in todays modern 
culture. With Futureworld, 
Trans-AM has defined a new genre 
of techno elevator music.
When forced away from the 
digital toys of the recording 
studio and into the limelight, the 
trios true musical talent 
may shine through. In that light, 
Trans-AMs rather offbeat 
music is certainly wortij 
experiencing at least once or twice.

Horoscopes by Ian Quazar
m/U ku/4/:
My dear friend Momo is still recovering 
from a viral infection which knocked her 
socks off last week, so, being the gentleman I 
am, I offered to channel her psychic energies 
and give you a dose of astro-loving Ian style.
Scorpio (October 24-r-Noveinber 21)
Start counting from 1. Keep going. Keep 
going. Stop. If the highest number you reached 
was between 1 and 15, you will have a glass 
eye by next Monday. The stars are not always 
kind, and your fate has been sealed in this 
matter. Speaking of seals, stay away from fur 
coats. The rabidity of animal rights protest
ers should not be underestimated. On the 
plus side for this week, Virgos envy your large 
penis/breasts. Yes, both.
Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 
Your laugh is very annoying. Dont laugh. 
Ever. Buy friends and influence with nudity. 
People will watch you strip and shake that 
booty. Use this newfound power quickly, for 
winter is fast approaching, and your lack of 
clothes could put you in a bind very shortly. If 
anyone complains about your naked figure, 
call it your personal touch.
Capricorn (December 22-Jariuary 19) 
You have never been blessed because your 
birthday is too close to the holidays. Your 
parents should have realized this, so obvi
ously your parents either dont like you or you
are a mistake. But dont worry. Sometimes 
the best things in life are unexpected. You, for 
instance, are very smooth. Start practicing 
your pick-up skills.
Aquarius (January 20-February 18) 
Gambling on the age of milk is not a good 
idea. In fact, just clean out your entire fridge. 
There is a terrible smell coming from the 
fridge and you have become accustomed to it, 
not realizing that everyone you come into 
contact with is made naseated. All of the 
bacteria in there could kill you. Cant you see 
them? They are crawling all over everything! 
Get them off of me!
Pisces (February 19 -March 20)
Every'time someone turns their head away 
from you, they are rollingtheir $jfes. Your one 
chance at fame and fortuVlies in the Mall of 
America; Go there, and yodel. Sing as much 
as you can. If you get/any gbod, you will 
become a pop icon and a tourist attraction. As 
you make your wayto the Mall, donate money 
to any Leos you encounter. You will know 
them by their paranoia.
Aries (March 2 -April 19)
Y oil must guard yourself against false accu
sations. Jealous neighbors plot against you. If 
you can avoid jail time, you will receive a 
strange caller who will ask you to cover your
self in peanut butter for a new Internet site. 
Dont belive the hype. Better opportunities 
will arrive. Peanut butter is sticky, anyway, 
and you dont need to add any more oil to your 
skin. Your mother ws right about 
your complexion.
Taurus (April 20-May 20)
Jupiter is moving out of alignment, and the 
coming of the crescent moon means it will be 
dark outside. This darkness, coupled with 
your clumsiness, is bad. My advice^ stay in 
well-lit rooms, dont work late, and if you ever 
get around to showering, do it with the light 
on. A helmet couldnt hurt either. You really 
are clumsy, not just accident-prone.
Gemini (May 21-June 21)
Ive been warned by a fellow astrologer that
raccoon sex'could be in your future. Read 
the Forum section. There you will see that 
sex with animais is a bad, bad thing. Never 
forget this.y You^still need to repent for last 
months escapade, you sicko. It might get 
you booted from organized religion. But you 
probably deserve it at this point.
Cancer (June 22-July22) \
We are entering the period on the calen
dar farthest from your birthday, but that 
really doesnt mean anything. Try to have 
some fun Tyhile you can. A few weeks from 
now, yu could be spending long hours in 
the library. Try not to sleep while youre 
there. After all, you went for a reason.. 
Other than the possibility of parts falling, 
off, the next week looks pretty safe for you.
Leo (July 23-August 22)
Time to stop sleeping on the couch. We 
are all tired of hearing about your potential 
for smoothness and suaveness. It is time to 
put up or shut up. Just please dont sing.. 
Your dreams of a rock-and-roll band are 
futile, so stop watching Behind the Music 
for tips. The people onthat show are messed 
up and watching it will only encourage you 
to do strange things.
Virgo (August 23-September 22) 
Halloween was bad for yo. I would triple
check any candy you picked up. In fact, go to 
the airport and run-it through the metal; 
detectors. At his point the guards will ask 
you questions; simply sa that a man gave 
you the package and asked you to carry it 
onto a plane and then shake it once you 
reached cruising heights. This seems 
strange, I know. But after your subsequent 
incarceration you will meet your soul mate.
Libra (September 2 -October 23)
Things are clouded right now. Dont go 
outside on Wednesday or Friday. If you 
dont already love Bette Midler and 
NASCAR, itVtime to start now. Developing 
these interests' will unconsciously help you 
make up for ybur other character flaws. 
Smile. Putting on a happy face will help you 
get through th next week.

Photography by Wingtat Yu is the lat
est exhibit at the University Center Art 
Gallery. During a high school photogra
phy class session, an innocent 17 yearold accidentally came across an old issue 
of Harpers Bazaar in the supplies cabi
net. Curiously, he picked up the fashion 
magazine and flipped through the high
ly polished avant-garde images. The kid 
truly liked what he saw. This was the 
beginning. The exhibit will be running
