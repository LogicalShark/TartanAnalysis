CMDS delays food court

The new food complex in Building D 
will not be open on the expected date of 
October 24.
According to Neal Binstock, assistant 
vice president for Business Services, the 
complex is running one week to 10 days 
behind schedule due to construction. 
Apparently, there is a problem concern
ing the pricing of the construction. The 
tentative opening date has been pushed 
back two weeks, to approximately the 
first or second week of November. We 
are revising the timing schedule, 
Binstock added, There are no new de
velopments at this time. We are gather
ing input.
A petition has been circulated around 
campus in an attempt to block the mov
ing of Wean Wok and the Cutting Board, 
but There has been no reversal of the 
decision to move into Building D. Cur
rent plans indicate that the Wean Wok 
and the Cutting Board will be moved 
from Wean to Building D.

construction. It plans to open someime during the first few weeks of November.
ment in Wean, La Prima Espresso, was 
initially unknown. Student input was 
considered on whether to move La Prima 
Espresso into Building D or leave it in 
Wean. Student input indicated that La 
Prima Espresso will stay in the Wean 
complex, said Binstock.
Student input will continue to be an 
important factor in decision making. 
This is not a decision we intend to make 
in a vacuum, Binstock commented.

Former RA resolves lawsuit
Alumnus settles out of court with University
By ANGELA MOLLOY
ByMAyX ennInAyXA whfn odIATM
Patrick Mooney, a CMU graduate, has settled 
out of court in his lawsuit against the University. 
Mooney, an outspoken Conservative and Catholic, 
sued the University in 1991 for wrongful 
termination.
Mooney had served as a Resident Assistant his 
freshman year and was going through the RA 
training sessions the next year, when he was fired 
'from the position.
During these training sessions, many techniques 
such as role-playing are used to familiarize RAs 
with situations that may occur with their resients.
In the session regarding Mooney, a role-playing 
feame was being used to train sensitivity to gay and
isbian issues.
In the role-playing, the RAs were asked to wear 
blacktriangles symbolizing homosexuality. Mooney 
refused to wear the pin.
Amy Ginther, the former assistant director of 
Housing for Operations and Roslyn Hall, the former 
area coordinator for Operations, questioned 
Mooney's ability to be sensitive to residents who 
were openly homosexual.
Mooney disagreed with the role-playing as a
whole, claiming his Catholic faith did not tolerate 
homosexuals. Mooney was fired from his RA posi
tion because there was a question as to whether or 
not he could be sensitive and understanding to one 
of his residents if he or she were gay.
Mooney filed suit against the University shortly 
after for wrongful termination. He was asking for 
compensation for his RA salary, and it is not known 
whether or not he sought punitive damages.
With the case pending for almost three years, a 
settlement was made out of court in July 1994. A 
deposition was held in May which heard testimony 
from Mooney, Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy, and representatives from the Housing 
Office.
Mooney has not commented on the settlement, 
even to close friends. He has only said, Im very 
happy with the way this ended up, which ap
peared in the September issue of Bch mcThXIpl 
Dean Murphy has also said that, I am pleased that 
the matter has been amicably resolved. No details 
of the settlement are available.
. The Mooney case has received local as well as 
national attention from newspapers such as the

in political science, is currently working for a

GSO to determine allocation
Grad students develop proposal for Senate meeting
By HEATHER ZINDLE
ByMAyX CHXITM SAyEEfMIAhM
In the Wednesday, September 7. meeting of the 
Graduate Student Organization, representatives 
voted 15-4 in favor of shutting down the Tilted 
Square graduate coffeehouse permanently. There 
were many monetary reasons for this decision, 
such as the extra $10,000 that GSO needed to come 
UP with up front, and the uncertainty as to whether 
the coffeehouse could break even in a new buildlng- The money needed for the coffeehouse might 
end up coming from money in the Student Activi
ties Pee, and therefore may cut into funds for other 
?rganizations. According, to GSO Vice President, 
Craig Brown, the closing has not caused many 
complaints among graduate students, even though 
they are saddened by the loss.
This decision raises many questions for both 
GSO and Student Senate. GSO. must Work out 
new plans for the space formerly reserved for the 
graduate coffeehouse in the student center. There 
ls also the question of what will happen to the 
510,000 grant allocated by Senate for the coffee
house, and if the money can be used by GSO, now 
that there will be no coffeehouse.
One of the other reasons for closing the coffeeuse was the space they were allotted in the 
Student Center, which has a seating capacity of 
about 30. Right now, because of the small size, GSO 
ls considering turning the room into a lounge area
for all students. According to Tim Mallo, the GSO 
President, an information wall within the lounge 
that will include materials pertinent to graduate 
students, plants, artwork, and perhaps a stereo 
and a television would create a comfortable atmo
sphere. GSO is also thinking of trying to move a La 
Prima cart into the space so it could be a place to 
sit and have coffee, or perhaps a sandwich from 
Entropy.
As to the question of the $10,000 dollars from 
Student Senate, according to Funding and 
Recognitions Chairman Merle Atkinson, The 
money is in limbo. It is frozen in an account. This 
means that Student Senate will not allocate the 
money to anyone else until GSO decides what to do 
with the space provided in the Student Center. 
According to Mallo, his organization is trying to 
present a proposal as soon as possible.
However, there is, some question as to whether 
the money can be used for any purpose other than 
the coffeehouse. According to Eric Rollins, the 
coffeehouse chair, it is not clear what is happening 
right now. It has not been discussed with Student 
Senate, but hopefully GSO will form and be able to 
develop a final proposal sometime this month to 
present at the next Senate meeting. There is a 
great deal of uncertainty in the future of the coffee
house. Right now, there has been no space allo
cated for it in the new University center. As of now 
it looks like the Tilted Square Graduate Coffee
house is a place of the past.

U.S. troops called to 
stop Iraqi movement
NEWYORK, October7(DJ)About 
20,000 Iraqi soldiers including mem
bers of the elite Republican Guard are 
moving toward the Kuwaiti border, 
Cable News Network reported.
Some of the troops, an estimated 
6,000, are already near the southern 
Iraqi town of Basra, Pentagon sources 
told CNN. It is the closest Iraqi troops 
have been to the Kuwaiti border since 
the Persian Gulf War.
The White House has said that U.S. 
military action is still premature, re
ported CNN.
Meanwhile, in New York, U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations, 
Madeleine Albright, told the U.N. Se
curity Council that 60,000 Iraqi troops 
could be at the Kuwait border within a 
week at the current rate of build up, a 
U.S. diplomat said. Albright was brief
ing the Security Council late today 
after the U.S. Defense Department
and U.S. State Department confirmed 
earlier that at least one or two divi
sions of Iraqi troops had moved to
ward the Kuwait border overnight 
Thursday. A potential strike force of 
about 60,000 troops could be at the 
border within a week, the diplomat 
told reporters. This includes 700tanks 
and about 900 personnel carriers, he 
said.
The diplomat said the U.S. now 
believes there were about three divi
sions of Iraqi troops near the Iraqi 
border and an additional two divisions 
may be moving south, bringing the 
total to 60,000 troops.
This would still leave Iraq with 
enough troops to attack the Kurds in 
the north, the U.S. diplomat said. 
We regard the Iraqi move as highly 
unusual and as an undue threatening 
of the Security Council at a time when 
sanctions are under review, he said.
CIA denies involvement in Haitian terrorist group
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey says U.S. 
intelligence agencies did not help set up 
a right-wing Haitian paramilitary group 
that terrorized supporters of exiled Presi
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Asked by 
reporters if there was any CIA connec
tion to the Front for the Advancement 
and Progress of Haiti, or FRAPH, 
Woolsey replied, No. Defense Secre
tary William Perry said reporters should 
not take that report too seriously, but 
he declined further comment on the alle
gations raised in this weeks issue of Bch 
wyAITX magazine. Bch DyncIXiATX mTnAb 
however, reported in todays editions 
that Emmanuel Constant, head of
FRAPH, was a paid CIA informant. And 
NBC News reported that the CIA also 
had Lt. Col. Michel Francois, the former 
Port-au-Prince police chief, on its pay
roll. Neither Bch mTnA nor NBC identi
fied the sources of its information. 
Former CIA Director Robert Gates said, 
meanwhile, it was inconceivable to me 
that there was an operation under way 
that was intended by the U.S. govern
ment or any part of it to be antagonistic 
to the newly elected government of 
Haiti. Gates headed the agency during

WASHINGTON, October 3 (DJ)  
Lawyers for the former Arkansas state 
employee who sued President Clinton 
for sexual harassment called on the presi
dent to settle the case by issuing a con
ciliatory statement, The Wall Street 
Journal reported.
Paula Joness attorneys proposed that 
the president publicly state that he 
doesnt deny meeting her in a Little 
Rock Hotel room in 1991 and that she 
didnt engage in any improper or sexual 
conduct. In the suit filed in May, Ms.
Jones alleged that President Clinton 
had made sexual advances toward her, 
which he denies. Ms. Joness lawyers, 
Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata, 
also asked that the president state that 
he believes her to be a truthful and 
moral person. The presidents lawyer, 
Robert Bennett, couldnt be reached for 
comment.
Asked about the offer, White House 
Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said the 
matter isnt being handled through the

Vets to provide 
proper drugs
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)  
Human health care reform failed to pass 
Congress but veterinarians got a little 
relief. Congress passed a bill allowing 
vets to prescribe the proper drugs for 
sick animals - legally. The original Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibited vets 
from prescribing drugs for any species 
or disease not specifically listed on the 
medicines label. But manufacturers 
cant afford to get Food and Drug Ad
ministration labeling approval of every 
single use for an animal drug. They 
simply distribute studies on when and 
for what animals the drug works. The 
FDA informally agreed that vets could 
use those studies to make their own 
prescription decisions, albeit with some 
restrictions to keep animals grown for 
food from getting certain drugs that 
might pose risks to humans. But vets 
feared regulators would change their 
minds, so Congress made this informal 
policy the law. "Sick animals should not 
be denied modem medical treatment, 
said cosponsor Sen. Howell Heflin, DAla.
Bankruptcy bill 
passes Senate
WASHINGTON, October 7 (D J)The 
Senate sent President Clinton a bill that 
would streamline and overhaul federal 
bankruptcy laws. Sen. Howell Heflin, 
DAla., described the bill, approved early 
this morning on a voice vote, as an at
tempt to update the code, as well as an 
effort to provide a rational framework 
from which future changes can evolve. 
The bill, among other things, is designed 
to clarify and balance the rights of debt
ors and creditors. It includes provisions 
that would expedite small business re
organization and encourage individuals 
to pay debts over time instead of liqui
date. The House approved the bill by 
voice vote Wednesday.
Senate approves 
budget director
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)The 
Senate, by voice vote, confirmed Alice 
Rivlin to the position of director of the 
White House Office ofManagement and 
Budget. The nomination wasnt contro
versial and didnt engender debate. 
Rivlin, the first woman to hold the post, 
replaces Leon Panetta, who left the po
sition over the summer to become White 
House Chief of Staff. Rivlin had been 
serving as deputy OMB director. Prior 
to her service at OMB, Rivlin was a 
senior fellow at the Brookings Institu
tion, a Washington-based think tank, 
where she headed the economic studies 
program, and earlier still, she served as 
the first director of the Congressional 
Budget Office. In her new post, Rivlin 
will have primary responsibility for draft
ing the administrations budget propos
als for the fiscal year beginning October 
1,1995. The President will present that 
budget to Congress in February. A ma
jor budget issue may be whether the 
administration should push for addi
tional deficit reduction to make up for 
the savings lost when health-care re
form failed. Under administration pro
jections, while declining at present, the 
federal deficit will soon turn upward 
again and soon exceed previous records 
if nothing is done to reign in mandatory 
spending programs, such as Medicare 
and Medicaid. Along with budgetary 
matters, OMB has considerable influ
ence over the affairs of various federal 
regulatory agencies.
Trade pact could 
hurt economy
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)  
Business worries that the world-trade 
pact delay bodes ill for global trade. 
Business officials fear the GATT fight 
may signal an end to Congresss biparti
san approach on trade. The delay has 
given a lot of Caterpillars foreign com
petitors hope theyll be insulated from 
the full force of U.S. competition, a 
Caterpillar official says. One concern: 
The U.S. wont be able to offer trade 
commitments to Latin American nations 
at a December summit. A senior official 
with a large export-driven company 
worries that the GOPs commitment to 
free trade is withering. The Republi
cans new contract has nothing on 
trade. And the lead GATT foe is GOP 
whip Gingrich, who has ties to protec
tionist textile billionaire Roger Milliken. 
Milliken gave more than $255,000 to 
Gingrichs Gopac between 1985 and 
1992. While some Republicans revel in 
Perots kind words for the GOP, others, 
including William Bennett, warn that 
his protectionist leanings undermine the 
partys traditional free-trade beliefs.
Accident victims 
allowed to sue
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)  
The Supreme Court agreed to review a 
lower-court ruling that said truck and 
auto accident victims may sue vehicle 
makers for failing to meet safety stan
dards that federal regulators have found 
inappropriate. The justices will hear an 
appeal by truck manufacturers 
Freightliner Corp., a unit of Germanys 
Daimler-Benz A.G., and Navistar Inter
national Corp. (NAV). Freightliner and 
Navistar were sued in a pair of Georgia 
cases involving injuries or death caused 
by collisions with tractor-trailers the 
companies made. The victims alleged 
that under Georgia state law, the manufacturers should be held liable for failing 
to equip their trucks with anti-lock 
brakes.
The defendant companies got the cases 
moved to a federal court in Georgia 
where they contended that the state-law 
claims were precluded because federal 
truck safety regulations make the use of 
anti-lock brakes optional. Afederal trial 
judge ruled for the manufacturers at 
preliminary stage, stressing the Department of Transportation had decided not 
to require anti-lock brakes for trucks 
until the devices were deemed more re
liable. But the federal appeals court 
based in Atlanta reversed that decision. 
The appeals court interpreted a sav
ings clause in the relevant federal stat-i 
ute as preserving claims based on state 
law, even when they appear to conflict 
with federal safety mandates. In their 
appeal to the Supreme Court, 
Freightliner and Navistar contend that 
the approach taken by the appeals court 
would have broad application to any 
motor vehicle accident case in which 
plaintiffs rely on state-law standards 
that are tougher than federal standards. 
The manufacturers also point out that 
other federal appeals courts have issued 
conflicting rulings that give broader pre
clusive effect to federal safety law.
Unemployment 
figures go down
WASHINGTON, October 7 (DJ)The 
September employment report should 
help calm fears that wage pressures are 
about to reignite inflation, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce said. The Sep
tember employment report shows that 
solid, but slower growth in the economy 
should not cause the labor market to 
burst at the seams, said Martin Rega
lia, chief economist for the Chamber of 
Commerce. Thats good news and should 
help calm the fear that inflationary wage1 
pressures are just around the comer. 
Whether or not its enough to calm the 
Fed is another question, Regalia saidin 
a prepared statement.
As reported, nonfarm payroll ; 
rose 239,000 in September, below mar-< 
ket expectations. The unemployment 
rate fell to 5.9 percent from 6.1 percent 
in August.

Inconvenient living 
disturbs students
TEMPORARY, from page 1
This year, all the students were 
moved out of the Holiday Inn by Sep
tember 14. However, not all of the 
studeits are happy with the move.
Someofthe students thatweremoved

Seobell has four floors each with its 
own lounge. At last count, there were 
students living in each lounge.
In speaking with residents of Seobell, 
they all had the same general focus. 
Matt Farrell, a freshman H&SS major 
said, I hate it. I dont have a problem 
with the actual student, but the fact 
that we dont have a lounge makes it 
hard to relax.
Similar comments came from Cliff 
Forlines, a freshman in MCS, and 
Derek Jander, a freshman in CIT. 
Were kind of torn, said Jander, I 
used to live in the lounge, and its not 
fun being the object of everyones 
grampiness.
Its not their fault, but that doesnt
make it any easier.
For. two other freshman, Matthew 
Monroe, ECE, and Matt White, ECE, 
the tension is definitely felt. These 
are two of the students who live in the
Neither are very happy with the 
situation. It just means that if they 
find us a spot well have to move 
again. We just want to be somewhere 
permanent.
SDC president Steve Badelt said, 
SDG has been batting around the 
Seobell situation. We're talking about 
various possibilities, but nothing is 
concrete yet.
Wed just like to see everyone 
settled and into permanent housing. 
Wed also like to give Seobell their 
lounges back.
There is no one to blame for this 
situation. Many parties are working 
to resolve it as quickly as possible.
The students in the lounges will be 
moved out as rooms become avail
able.

The rising cost of getting a college 
education in America has led some stu
dents and parents to question the need 
for tuition increases, and the process 
through which theyre derived. Bill 
Elliott, Carnegie Mellons vice president 
for enrollment, has spent many hours 
wrestling with the problem.
How is tuition set? Ive been a part of 
that process for probably twenty years, 
said Elliott. We spend a lot of time on 
the tuition question.
One thing students often want to know 
is how their money is spent. Elliott said 
that its impossible to distinguish be
tween tuition money and other income. 
You cannot, in the accounting system of 
any university, put in tuition and watch 
it pay for something on the other side, 
said Elliott. Once these monies enter 
the budget, they become somewhat 
fungible.
Colleges have a variety of incomes, 
said Elliott, including interest from the 
universitys endowment, governmental 
and corporate grants, and gifts from 
alumni.
The money is then used for all of the 
various expenses incurred by the uni
versity, including faculty and staff sala
ries, administrative expenses, andmaintenance and expansion of the physical 
plant.
One thing that this University does 
not take into account when it sets tu
ition, he said, is how potential cash in
creases will be spent. The tuition com
mittees, for as long as Ive been involved, 
have not been allocation committees, 
Elliott said, but they have written sug
gestions about how to allocate the money.
The cost of attending the University is 
ultimately set by the Board of Trustees.
The tuition committee takes a myriad 
of factors into account when making its 
decisions, but the process can be broken 
down into three questions, said Elliott. 
How much money would you like to 
spend to change or improve the prod
uct, he said, how much are people 
willing to pay, and how high is the rate 
of inflation?
One of the biggest expenses is pay
roll, he says. Running a university is 
very labor-intensive. Faculty members 
are paid salaries commensurate with 
their talent. People ask, Why do you 
want to keep the salaries high? Elliott 
said. We pay faculty members to do one 
thing, he said, not to go somewhere 
else.
The rate of compensation is necessary 
to insure the quality of teaching and 
quality of research remains high. Sala
ries become very important to maintain
ing the quality of the organization, he 
said. Institutions are not looking to pay 
people just for the sake of spending 
money.
Elliott said that, yearly tuition in
creases may be a necessary evil. At the 
bare minimum, you have to increase it to 
match the rate of inflation, he said.
Increased service means in
creased cost
The problem with merely tying tuition 
increases to the rate of inflation, said 
Elliott, is that the purchasing power of 
the University never increases. We do a 
lot more things than we used to, he 
said. Take computers, for example. This 
institution has made huge investments 
in computing. If were going to spend
money on computers, what will we not 
spend money on? Or will we increase 
tuition?
The list of what you would like to do 
is always going to be in excess of what 
youve got, Elliott said. Universities 
have continued to add more services  
there are increased demands on people 
in housing, security, the shuttle service 
 that everybody wants more of. If you 
and I want more stuff, then you have to 
make some hard choices. This is a zerosum game.
If we had more money, what would 
we do with it? There are 10,000 people at 
this institutionstudents, faculty, and 
staff. Im sure that any one of us could 
find something to spend money on that 
would make this a better place, Elliott 
said.
But if all 10,000 of us wanted to 
spend $2,000, then by my arithmetic, 
thats $20 million, and then were into 
some real money. Elliott said that costcutting is not as simple as finding and 
eliminating waste. Carnegie Mellon is 
not a place that has got a lot of over
head, he said. Theres not a lot of man
agement in administration here.
Theres four or five of us who run this 
place  the real management is in the 
deans offices. The administration is very 
lean here at Carnegie Mellon. Theres 
not necessarily all the TDells and whistles 
that people expect out of the administra
tion.
Universities are not a great deal dif
ferent from you or I as individuals, he 
said. If spending is greater than in
come, then we cant stay in business 
very long. Elliott said that the Univer
sity has been careful when budgeting 
not to overextend itself. We have made

If 25 percent of the debt is 
not returned, switching

Jill requires ;rime report
py MAX CHITTISTER
XyMAyX CHXITM SAyEEfMIAhM
Due to a new bill passed by both the 
>ennsylvania State House and Senate, 
11 reports of incidents and crimes must 
e posted in public. The bill, which has 
Jet to be signed by Governor Bob Casey, 
equires a mandatory public log of crime 
nd incidents on a daily basis, accordto Campus Security Chief James 
,aPaglia. There will be no differentia
tion between students and non-students 
jn these reports. Victims names and 
Eyewitnesses names cannot be posted... 
Absolutely not, said LaPaglia. HowJver, the names of people arrested, 
Whether student or non student, must 
. posted. All valid complaints must 
included in the report. This includes 
both medical calls and service calls. All 
onfidential calls must also be reported, 
/hich LaPaglia feels is unfortunate.
For the last six weeks, members of the 
MU campus have been able to access 
(he Crime Information Line. By dialing 
Ixtension 8-4400, students can access a 
(oice mail report that features both a 
1/eekly update on crime on campus and 
monthly information newsletter.
The report also includes the most re
cent crime report and safety and crime 
jrevention tips. These tips are also pubjshed in the Campus Watch newsletter. 
[}i addition, the Crime Information Line 
jives callers access to the campus police 
in case of an emergency.We already 
jive... more [information! than most 
iampuses, LaPaglia commented. CMtFs 
i the first campus police department 
to use voice-mail technology to inform 
;he population on crime.
The bill does not specify what the 
iature of the postings must be. There
fore, the new postings could be imple
mented into the existing voice mail profram, but it would be very difficult to 
update daily.
Crime and Incident Report
9/7 THEFT/CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
12:15 am. A male parked his truck outside of the Original Hotdog in Oakland 
at around 9 pm. When he returned after 
midnight, the student discovered that 
unknown parties had stolen his metal 
tail gate strip, four tie down screws, a f 
foot 4x4 and damaged his front window. 
The window was cracked from the pas
senger side to the rear view mirror. No 
suspects were reported.
9/30 RECEIVING STOLEN PROP
ERTY, 2:15 am. A guard witnessed an 
individual carrying a metal Compact 
Spaces sign from a campus parking 
area. The guard stopped the student 
and identified him. The student, who 
was a male, said he was going to talk the 
sign, but discarded it when he realized it 
was too large for him to get it into his 
dorm room in Morewood without being 
noticed. The student was issued an in
ternal citation for receiving stolen prop
erty.
10/2 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 1:05 
pm. An officer was dispatched to a fra
ternity house for a vandalism report. 
The complainant had reported that be
tween four and five am, unknown per
sons shot off two dry chemical fire extin
guishers in the rear stairway. The dry 
chemical covered the stairwell and en
tered into the houses kitchen and din
ing room. Someone was heard in the 
stairway but by the time any brothers 
responded, the person was gone. One 
fire extinguisher was missing from the 
house, so police think the other must 
have come from another location. A clean
up crew was notified and a maintenance 
request was submitted.
10/2 EXCESSIVE NOISE, 1:11am. A 
resident advisor in West Wing reported 
a loud party in one of the suites.
The call to Campus Police was made 
after the RA had warned the residents to 
keep the noise level down. Officers re
sponded to the scene and found music at 
an acceptable level and people spilling 
into the hall. Because the resident had 
been previously warned about noise level, 
he will be issued an internal citation 
through student affairs.
10/3 MISSING PERSON, 2:08 pm. 
Campus Police received a missing per
sons fax by the New Jersey Police De
partment concerning six students who 
were traveling to CMU to visit a friend. 
Detectives spoke to parents of the miss
ing teenagers and tried to contact the 
student who the students were going to 
visit. The group was traveling in a car 
identified by both police departments 
and was seen outside of Boss Hall. The 
group of students included one female 
and five males. The father of the female 
was notified by campus police and he 
said he was coming to CMU to pick her 
up.
10/4 MEDICAL ESCORT, 6:33 pm. 
An officer was dispatched to Resnik to 
take a CMU student to Childrens Hos
pital. The students mother telephoned 
police and said her son had a heart 
condition and needed immediate trans
port to the hospital.
The student wanted to be sure he was 
not suffering from meningococcemia 
bacteria.
10/4 THEFT, 9:57 pm. A graduate 
Research Assistant reported to an of
ficer that someone had entered a locked 
area in the Thermo Sciences lab and 
removed a color printer from an un
locked cabinet. Nothing else was miss
ing except for the printer manual.
10/4 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,
11:39 pm. A resident in Mudge house 
reported that bottles were being tossed 
out of Mudge onto Fifth Avenue. The 
person reporting the incident said he 
was able to identify which window the 
bottles were coming from, the resident
of that room denied any involvement;. A 
report was written and the RA was noti
fied.
10/5 INFORMATION, 10:30 am. A 
female graduate student reported that 
when she was walking on Morewood 
Ave. near the fraternities, she was ap
proached by a white male, in his early 
20s with a thin build, and very Italian 
looking. The male asked the graduate 
student for her name and if she would go 
out with thin. Four days later, the gradu
ate student was on the University of 
Pittsburgh campus and saw the same 
male, this time in a vehicle. This time, 
he asked her for directions and then her 
name. When the graduate student said 
they had met before, the male got very 
nervous and drove away.
10/5 THEFT, 7:57 pm. A staff mem
ber reported that there had been a theft 
in one of the rooms in Hamburg Hall. 
The staff ember said that sometime be
tween 7:30 and 7:50 pm, someone en
tered her unlocked office and stole her 
purse from under her desk.

DELAYED, from page 1
Binstock added. If La Prim a Espresso 
stays in Wean, the cart in Baker/Porter 
will probably be a lunch cart. Binstock 
added that it would not make much 
sense to have another cart serving coffee 
and pastries in the same vicinity.
One of the problems many students 
share with the move is a perceived lack 
of accessibility. Binstock feels that this 
will not be a problem. Yes, I do believe 
it is [accessible]... We have a culture on 
campus that, if its not right next to us, 
its too far away. Demographic studies 
indicate that Building D is accessible 
from Wean, Scaife, and Hammerschlag. 
Timing studies have also been per
formed. These indicate that the average 
time from Doherty Hall to Building D is 
only one and a half to three minutes.
Building D is wheelchair accessible 
from the back door of Wean. Binstock 
does not feel that cold weather will be a 
factor this winter.
There is also a little-known access 
route to Building D from the Hamburg/ 
Smith complex.
From the ground floor of Smith, there 
are tunnels which lead to Building C. 
There is a walkway from Building C to 
Building D.
This route is entirely indoor, and is 
also wheelchair accessible.
Student opinion is varied on the move 
into Building D. Tushar Dubey, an H&SS 
freshman, has only eaten at Wean Wok 
once. He said, It wont make any differ
ence to me.
Bob Buchko, a freshman member of 
the University Choice program, dis
agrees. Its hard enough to get down 
there to the bookstore.
He does not feel that students with 
only a half an hour between classes will 
make use of the Building D facilities. I 
think Im not going to go down there. I 
think a lot of people arent going to go 
down there.
High costs equal student service
UITI0N, from page 3
pugh decisions, he said. Salary 
Towth has not necessarily been 
|igh. 
Whats the value of a CMU 
education?
There are a number of quesions that need to be asked when 
valuating the relative costs of 
ttending one university rather 
Jian another, said Elliott. How 
jnportant is a college? he asked. 
How important is a Carnegie 
ttellon education? What do you 
my when you get a Carnegie 
jlellon education? Youre not just 
luying classes, youre also buyng the experience. Is this going 
:o be an interesting place to be?
: Intangibles like extracurricuactivities also need to be conidered. Intramurals, student 
ictivities, [there are a] whole 
uinch of different things on this 
ampus, he said. The question 
I. Gee, how much are people
willing to pay for this stuff? Is 
J there a significant differeiici be
tween Penn State and Carnegie 
Mellon for the difference in price? 
The most important person to 
ask is yourself. Its a value judg
ment on your part as to why one 
goes to Carnegie Mellon or an
other place or a school similar to 
Carnegie Mellon, like the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania or 
Cornell. Price is but one way to 
decide.
Conflicts arise when academi
cally talented students cannot 
afford to attend CMU. You could, 
at some point, become an institu
tion only for ,very rich people, he 
said. You want a diversification 
of intellectually able people here. 
Elliott called financial aid con
siderations critical when tuition 
is set. Tuition increases find their 
way back into financial aid, he 
said.Students have to pay for the 
increase somehow, and there are 
basically two ways: More loans, 
he said, or more jobs.
Of course, we talk to students 
and parents, Elliott- said. -Last 
year, a large group of students 
and parents met for three or four 
hours during a symposium and 
discussion session [on tuition].
Income is not just tuition
Your tuition, which is not 
trivial, does not by a long shot 
begin to cover the cost of running 
a university, he said.. In real
ity, it costs us more to have un
dergraduates here than we re
ceive; but one of the inherent com
modities that a university needs 
is students! Whats the mission 
of an institution? he said, nam
ing three: distribution of educa-. 
tion and knowledge, research and 
development, and returning 
something of social and cultural 
value to the community that the 
university serves.
Carnegie Mellon is in Pitts
burgh. We are here, he said. We 
have a very vested interest in
what happens to this part of the 
country. Elliott drew a parallel 
with the famous comment by a 
General Motors executive tha.t 
what was good for General Mo
tors was goodfor America. Were 
not a separate entity. What hap
pens to western Pennsylvania 
happens to Carnegie Mellon, and 
to some extent, what happens at 
Carnegie Mellon happens to west
ern Pennsylvania, he said. 
Whats good for Carnegie Mellon 
is good for Pittsburgh, and vice 
versa.The Universitys budget is 
set far in advance, but Elliott 
said that the financial planning 
for the next fiscal year is not 
complete yet.
Correction
In the sidebar to the article entitled Freshman dies of 
menmgococcemia Joseph Gordons name was accidently misspelled to read Joseph Morgan.
In the article entitled, CMU students arrested it was stated 
that William Motley declined to comment. William Motley was 
never asked to comment;
In the weekly column, This week in DH 2210, it was reported 
that Steven Speilberg directed The Flinstones. The movie was 
directed by Brian Levant.
The Tartan regrets these errors.

FORUM
Homecoming Picnic 
fails to fulfill purposes
Last weekends Student 
Alumni Relations Council 
(SARC) picnic failed miserably 
in its purported mission. $2,500 
of the Student Activities Fee 
was allocated to SARC for the 
purpose of enhancing studentalumni relations. What SARC 
did was give a free Highlander 
lunch to students and a cheerful 
afternoon on the Mall for 
alumni. All of a sudden, SARC 
thinks we students are supposed 
to feel such a strong bond with 
the Alumni  whom we got 
separated from.
When the organizers of the 
picnic saw storm clouds gather
ing early Saturday morning, 
they shuffled students off to 
Dining Services, and made sure 
the alumni stayed nice and dry 
under the tent, with no pesky 
students to push them out in 
the rain. (Of course, it didnt 
rain until long after the picnic 
was over.)
Wasnt it supposed to be student-alumni relations? Its kind 
of hard to relate to somebody 
when youre in Highlander and 
theyre out on the lawn by Baker 
Hall. So for $2,500, students got 
their usual choice of Highlander 
or Morewood, while alumni got 
the tent, music, entertainment, 
decorations, and the great out
doors. Of course, they got Din
ing Services food, too, which will 
help the Alumni House Annual 
Fund immensely, no doubt.
So what it comes down to is
students  for the purpose of 
increasing student-alumni re
lations .became a segregated 
lunch, with alumni coming out 
far happier and better fed. This 
is what SARC wants you to be
lieve is good student-alumni 
policy.
Obviously, every picnic needs 
abad weather contingency plan, 
but couldnt the organizers have 
sent, oh, half the students and 
half the alumni to Highlander? 
And speaking of Highlander, 
couldnt they have done some
thing to avoid serving Dining 
Services food, which seems to 
get worse every day? Give the 
students a break  they got 
essentially the same food they 
can get every day  and try to 
show the alumni CMUs good 
points, not its inability to find a 
decent chef.
What were saying, SARC, is, 
you blew it. Student-alumni 
functions are supposed to ben
efit everyone who attends them. 
Students get to meet graduates 
and learn what its like in the 
real world, while doing some 
serious networking; alumni get 
to talk to current students about 
what CMU life is like these days, 
and maybe get a chance to look 
around campus in the process.
What the SARC picnic pro
vided alumni  food and enter
tainment on a nice afternoon  
is almost acceptable. What the 
picnic provided students  a 
free block meal  is inexcusthis: a picnic paid for by the able.
Emergency services 
require better funding
There is a medical emergency 
here at CMU. and were not talk
ing about diseases. If you get 
seriously hurt, you are going to 
need emergency help as quickly 
as possible. For this reason, The 
Emergency Medical Service 
(EMS) exists. This group is 
staffed by dedicated student 
volunteers who, at the first sign 
of an accident, go out of their 
way to help those who have been 
injured. It would seem that a 
service as essential as this would 
be valued by the university. Un
fortunately, this may not be the 
case.
Last year Student Senate, 
justly we feel, voted to not fund 
EMS. The rationale being that 
since this service benefits fac
ulty, staff and students, the uni
versity should pick up the tab. 
While the university has done 
that, we feel that more needs to 
be given.
We do not mean to say that the 
volunteers of EMS cant do their 
job. They are, however, under
staffed and lack the equipment 
necessary to do the job ad
equately. We have heard horror 
stories of students waiting for 
long periods of time for EMS. 
Lets face it, these volunteers 
are students too. Sometimes 
they are yanked out of class to 
respond to emergencies that 
need immediate attention. This 
is not fair to EMS. Nor is it fair 
to the community that depends 
on them.
If EMS was provided with 
more money, there would be

many ways that it could im
prove.
First, it might be a good idea 
to hire at least one professional 
Emergency Medical Technician 
(EMT). This way, there would 
be someone on call at all times, 
without having to pull students 
out of classes.
With professional help, volun
teer students could have regu
lar staff hours when they arent 
in class. Also, someone would be 
on call that was in the location 
of where the emergency equip
ment was kept and the student 
wouldnt have to run from class 
to the office and then to the 
emergency.
Second, it would be a good 
idea to make this a paying job. It 
could still be staffed with stu
dents, but with pay, the incen
tive to get the necessary train
ing and join EMS would be 
greater. We even think that stu
dents would be willing to work 
for a small stipend; hence, not 
costing as much as hiring all 
full-time EMTs.
It is obvious that EMS is a 
necessary service. Which leads 
one to expect that it should get 
all the help it can from those in 
charge.
If there is an emergency, these 
are the people we depend on. 
While they do their job to the 
best of their ability, they need 
more support. We hope it doesnt 
take a tragedy to make people 
take notice of this group and 
how important it is to our cam
pus.

Occtt obte
ness upsets student body, 10/3]. First, 
there are two different Stewart calculus 
books. After speaking with the store 
manager and textbook buyer for the 
anonymous closest comparison book
store, they sell Stewart Calculus: Early 
Transcendentals (ISBN 0-534-138-30- 
6). The Textbook Store sold Stewart 
Calculus (ISBN 0-535-13212-x). These 
are two totally different books and can
not be compared. The article reported 
the cost price of the Stewart Calculus 
book was sold to the Textbook Store at a 
33.3 percent discount. This is incorrect; 
the Carnegie Mellon book was invoiced 
at net prices and $10 higher than the 
reporters calculated cost.
A few comments regarding literature 
books. There are ten different publish
ers for Merchant of Venice, 17 publish
ers for Madame Bovary, and two pub
lishers for Romance ofTristan & Iseult. 
It is the Textbook Stores policy to pur
chase the titles from the publishers re
quested by the professor as listed on the 
requisition. Also, two titles are imprinted 
with the manufacturers suggested re
tail price which is identical to the book
store ticket price.
Finally, an analysis of last years net 
sales (after the student discounts) and 
the cost of the textbooks, the Textbook 
Store maintained an 18.2 percent 
markup on new textbooks. The most 
recent NACS (National Association of 
College Stores) Course Book Survey re
veals that only two percent of college 
stores sell textbooks in the 20 percent 
or less markup category. Said in other 
words, 98 percent of the national college 
bookstores sell textbooks at a higher 
price.
Thank you for the opportunity to clear 
up some confusing information which 
was reported.

Welfare needs major overhaul
Cythn SAh4yXh,
At the heart of the matter on the issue of welfare is 
whether the government should be handling it at all. If so, 
should the federal government be the prime mover and 
shaker? My answer (guess what) is no on both counts.
What is welfare but charity?
(Im not talking about unem
ployment subsidy, which is a 
government run insurance 
business  a different can of 
worms.) Why does the federal 
government have to run chari
ties? The US gives enormous 
amounts of money to charity. I 
dont see why there is a need for 
government coercion in the 
business.
What do you mean by government coercion? you might 
ask. This means that welfare is a charity which you have no 
choice about contributing to. You dont want to contribute? 
Well, youre in jail for tx evasion. I suppose this actually 
discloses that welfare really InXzA charity, but theft, for what 
is a forced redistribution of wealth but theft?
But everyone benefits from welfare; its not theft, is the 
common rejoinder. I dont think so. In what way do I benefit 
from welfare? I suppose it has done me the favor of destroy
ing family structure and creating a permanent underclass, 
but somehow I dont see those things as favors. This country 
got along just fine without welfare, relying on the charity of 
its citizens. Welfare merely turned us away from charity, 
and towards theft.
Its damned inefficient theft at that. If you were a burglar 
and only got 27 percent of what you stole, wouldnt you be 
disappointed? Well, thats what percentage of each welfare 
dollar makes it to the people whom it supports.
Where does the other 73 percent go? Towards a worthless 
collection of bureaucrats and social workers whose main
Why do you think welfare keeps getting worse? The people who 
run it have no profit in a better situation, only a worse one.
Of course this being an election year were hearing all kintfi 
of rhetoric about welfare reform from both sides of the aisle. 
On the side of the Democrats, most of it is job training a 
workfare.
In other words, further money sinks. Programs such as these 
have shown just about zero effectiveness. Job training gener
ally misses the boat, producing people with skills that fit n. 
jobs. Also, if the people on welfare had the motivation to have 
been suitably trained in the first 
place they wouldnt be where 
they are.
Workfare is an even worse 
joke, in which you take peop* 
on welfare and throw more 
money at the problem so that 
you feel better by making thee 
do something.
____________________________ Of course it all ends up beinj
ttttt made-up work which benefit 
no one. What, did you actually think that any of the public 
work unions would allow their jobs to be handed over to people 
on welfare? Think again.

Students disgraced in library pilferage
CynTX BTiahM
Anyone who attended an American high 
jchool took a civics class at some point. 
Mine was taught by the athletic director, 
who, like every high school civics teacher, 
explained the concept of rights and re
sponsibilities to our 16-year-old minds with 
this illustration:
"Your right to swing your fist, he said, 
ends at the tip of my nose.
And, of course, we all laughed, not be
cause we wanted to sock him one, but 
because the phrase has been repeated so 
often that its become a clich. Unfortu
nately, a great number of us who sat in 
classrooms across the country apparently 
were dozing, because theyre swingingtheir 
fists indiscriminately, bloodying every nose 
within reach.
Barra Jacob-McDowell, the reserves as
sistant at Hunt Library, has seen disturb
ing evidence of this trend first hand (I 
wont pretend that I used an unsympa
thetic source; I work with Barra at the 
library).
She says that abuse of library materials 
put on reserve by faculty members for 
their classes has hit a new high this year, 
. it upsets her a great deal. I have 
never, in the three and a half years that
Ive worked here, had so many reserves 
items stashed, damaged, or pilfered, Barra 
says. Its unethical, its selfish, its illegal, 
and its wrong.
So far this semester, eight items have 
been vandalized in some way, she says. The 
most recent incident occurred Thursday 
night, when both copies of a reserve for one 
class were stolen.
Its not fair to the other [students in] the
leagues and neighbors?
In my younger, more foolish days (two 
years ago), I lived in Morewood E-Tower, 
and a better example of this selfishness 
cannot be imagined. Each day brought a 
new outrage  all of the lounge furniture 
thrown out the window and smashed, for 
example, or entire rolls of toilet paper 
flushed down the commodes, or all the 
ceiling lights in the stairwell busted. At

had for their colleagues and neighbors?
class, she says. I realize that competitive
ness is encouraged here, but there yMh lim
its, and there ncTHrd be limits.
If you feel that you have to stoop to 
stealing to get a good grade, then it doesnt 
say much for your character or your val
ues.
Why do an increasing number of people 
at Carnegie Mellon have such a callous 
disregard for the rights and needs of oth
ers? The world is a cold, cruel place, to be 
sure, but whatever happened to the basic 
respect that people once had for their colthe end of the year, each resident of ETower was assessed almost thirteen dol
lars for room damage fees, or about twelve 
more than I can afford.
Quite frankly, what gives you the right 
to lower my quality of life so that you can 
get your jollies through some random, 
senseless destruction? The loss to myself 
and other E-Tower residents was tempo
rary  we couldnt use the plumbing on 
our floor, or the lounge. The damage done 
when someone takes something that ev
eryone needs to use for a class, like library materials, can be permanent if it 
adversely affects that persons grades.
CMU students are supposed to be the 
kMJth dh ry kMJththe top percentage of 
young people, says Jacob-McDowell. I 
realize that its a very small percentage of 
people that act this way, but it seems to 
be increasing, and it worries me. I cant 
understand why people would act like 
that.
I really do like working here, because 
so many of the students are so bright and 
talented, she says, but its really unfor
tunate that this kind of thing is happen
ing and increasing.
It is unfortunate, and I wish I knew 
why this was happening or what the 
solution is. I do know that many mem
bers of the Carnegie Mellon community 
are so focused on their own lives that they 
fail to realize that their actions affect the 
world they live in. Until that changes, I 
fear we wont see much of an improve
ment.

Parents, break free of mainstream medicine
2yAA yrr
A lot of things are expected of 
new parents in this society. Even 
before the child is born, most 
people believe that a pregnancy 
must be actively managed by an 
expert. In many cases, this ex
alted sage is a man who has never 
experienced a menstrual cramp, 
letalone morning sickness, a rap
idly changing body, or a camelback contraction. It is to this 
white-coated person that women 
are supposed to turn every few 
weeks (or days, when the time is 
critical) throughout her preg
nancy, for blood tests, ultra
sounds, internal exams, etc.
With the radical idea that preg
nancy is not an illness, my wife 
andl decided to consult with mid
wives instead of doctors. This still 
involved a lot of nervous testing 
and prodding, but at least during 
delivery my wife was not hooked 
up to machines and IVs, told to lie 
on her back (so gravity can keep
the baby in,.I guess), or allowed 
only ice chips.
Later, it is interesting to con
sider to whom the child belongs. 
In many cases after birth, the 
baby is taken from the mother for 
weighing and cleaning, soon to 
lie alone in a nursery with a num
ber of other screaming, 
frightened people suddenly 
facing a big, cold world alone.
The drug companies cant 
wait to get ahold of a new 
customer either. Immedi
ately upon opening their 
eyes, they have their vision 
smeared with antibiotic oint
ment. Then their body is in
vaded by a needle to give 
them Vitamin K, as all chil
dren unfortunate enough to 
be bom previous to the mod
ern miracle men bled to 
death. By some miracle, our 
child didnt die without the 
injection or the antibiotic.
Next in line are the vac
cines. The most famous of 
these is the polio vaccine, 
which comes in two varieties  
live and killed. Proponents of the 
live say the killed is ineffective, 
and proponents of the killed say
the live is too dangerous. This naturally-occurring cases of poprompted the late pediatrician lio in this country since 1979,

and, as reported recently, polio 
has been vanquished in the 
western hemisphere, with the last 
case in Peru in 1991. What these 
reports dont say is that some 
have developed polio, even in the 
US, but only by receiving 
the'live vaccine. In other 
words, the chance of some
one in the US getting polio 
is zero, HXrhnn they are 
given the live vaccine. Yet 
the industry continues to 
push and profit from this 
panacea, the only mecha
nism keeping polio alive in 
this hemisphere.
Studies done by the medi
cal community and re

nals have consistently 
shown the lack of efficacy 
for other vaccines. For ex

States today. There have been no who were properly vaccinated. In
addition to this, there have been 
a number of incidences where the 
inoculation of a child was fol
lowed by a serious reaction, in
volving seizures, fever, brain 
damage, and death.
And for what? To attempt (and 
often fail) to prevent diseases that 
are relatively mild and benign. A 
single death from one of these 
diseases  almost always in an 
extremely odd case with extenu
ating circumstancesis national 
news, a call to arms by the needle 
patrol. Yet every year, about 50 
children drown in plastic five 
gallon buckets! Every year! Does 
the anti-bucket campaign receive 
one-fiftieth of the attention or 
budget of the polio vaccine?
While our children are expected 
to be submitted to the latest and 
most extensive testing and medi
cation by the experts, our infant 
mortality rate remains one of the 
highest in the world. Parents who 
question the white robes are de
rided, at best. And our society 
continues its marriage to modern 
medicine in sickness, till death.

Welfare seems little more than glorified charity
CHARITY, from page 6
off benefits after a year, no bonus for extra 
children, and no assistance for minors, 
avoid the core of the issue. Theyre afraid 
of being pegged as insensitive or cal
lous. They havent the guts to take on the 
fundamental issue that this is none of the 
governments business.
Where in the Constitution is it spelled 
out that the federal government has the 
power to run a publicly-sponsored charity
organization, and make it mandatory for 
all citizens and states? Hmm, it isnt in the 
Bill of Rights. I never saw an amendment 
on it. The core articles do have a curious  
phrase provide for the general welfare, 
but making the monstrosity that is now 
welfare out of this is quite a step. Id say 
that the current system certainly doesnt 
provide for the general welfare. Id say it 
detracts from it.
By now, you might be saying, How can
you be so callous and cruel? These people 
need help.
IXhb aTH help them, or maybe Ill help 
them if I like. I can imagine doing that 
through a private charity.
The current system, on the other hand, 
doesnt help them. It traps them. It 
teaches that self-reliance is unnecessary. 
It bans frugality and savings. It dis
criminates against families and respon
sibility. It is an inefficient system of theft
masked as compassion and I accept no 
part of it as ethical or reasonable.
Lets go back to what we once had  a 
system where people would rely on either 
themselves or the charity of others, not 
asking Big Brother to bring over the dough 
in exchange for a vote.

Men's soccer keeps winning, downs F&M
py MATTHEW SOLITRO
AyMAyX ennInAyXA S4TMAn odIATM
The mens soccer team had a relajvely easy week after three big wins the 
,revious week. Their only game this 
veekwas a home match against Franklin
Marshall. The Tartans were able to 
8tay unbeaten at home with a 4-0 vicBry over F&M.
The Tartans were on fire at the start of 
the first half and opened up with two 
juick goals. Senior forward Michael 
jrazinski assisted senior forward Alex 
Amezquita on his first goal. Amezquitas 
,last knocked the F&M goalie out of the 
jame with an injured hand. Brazinski 
cored a goal of his own soon afterwards.
1 However, after the second goal, the 
artans seemed to lack their usual ingnsity. CMUs defense was playing well, 
flowing very few opportunities for F&M, 
jutthey were having difficulty creating 
hots on goal.
They went into halftime with a 2-0
lead and a sense that they could be doing 
a lot more offensively.
The Tartans pulled things together 
for the second half and started playing 
their usual quick, controlling style. The 
Tartans were buzzing around the net for 
much of the second half. They were fi
nally able to score when senior midfielder 
Vince Russell made a nice move along 
the endline and crossed it to Amezquita, 
who headed it in for his second goal of 
the game.
It wasnt what we wanted at times 
out there, but at the same token that 
third goal was gorgeous, said senior 
midfielder Chuck Kuba.
CMU scored another goal soon after
wards. Amezquita sent a long pass 
downfield to Brazinski, who just took off 
past the last two F&M defenders. F&Ms 
goalie came charging out, but Brazinski 
shot the ball past him and into the lower 
right comer of the net. The team contin
ued to keep the pressure on, but they 
were not able to score again before the
end of the game.
We got the goals. We wanted a good 
showing against this team, said Kuba. 
I dont know if were really happy with 
how we played. We knew it was a big 
game today and we got the result.
Last week, Brazinski was namedUAA 
Player of the Week. He led the Tartans 
to three victories last week with six 
points. He scored the game-winning goal 
in both the Wayne sburg and Emory 
games; he also had the game-winning 
assist in the NYU game.
In two weeks, the team will go on its 
most important road trip of the year. 
They will face two UAA opponents, the 
University of Rochester and Brandeis 
University.
Weve got a big weekend coming up. 
Hopefully well be able to turn it up a 
notch for that, said Kuba.
This week, the Tartans travel to Al
legheny and then host Penn StateBehrend College in their final home game 
of the year on Satuday.
Senior forwards Mike Brazinski (#4) and Alex Amezquita (#15) both had two goals 
and an assist against Franklin & Marshall on Sunday.

The womens varsity tennis 
;eam has turned things around 
ifter getting off to a poor start 
his year. The Tartans currently 
lave four wins, eight loses, and 
bne tie, and they have won their 
ast two matches.
The season had a rough start, 
but we feel that we are improving 
and are looking forward to the 
'pring season, said sophomore 
ichelle Cook. The Tartans won 
their first match 8-0 against 
JVaynesburg but then tied Seton 
fill.
After that, the Tartans trav
eled to Grove City and were 
beaten 9-0. Then they lost a 
close match to Geneva by a score 
)f5-4. We have lost a lot of close 
natches this year, but we are
win against Mercyhurst would 
have been a good win for us, said 
Rotunno. But in spite of the loss, 
we showed signs of improvement 
as a team.
Frostburg was the next oppo
nent for the Tartans. They beat 
the Tartans 4-1, but the team 
bounced back with a 4-1 victory 
over Waynesburg.
The team then lost their next 
two matches. Penn StateBehrend defeated the Tartans 9- 
0. Their next match was against 
the University of Rochester, who 
won 9-0.
Tthe Tartans have showed 
some improvement by winning 
their last two matches. They 
turned around and beat Penn 
State-Behrend 6-3 in a rematch, 
and then came home to play 
Chatham. They won the match 
by an impressive 9-0 score.
Rotunno feels that the team 
has shown great improvement 
over the course of the semester.
They are 
young, butthey 
have positive 
attitudes, said 
Rotunno. The 
Tartans only 
have two se
niors starting 
for the team, 
Stephanie 
Kukura and 
Cherie Lin. 
The rest of the 
Tartans in
clude mostly 
sophomores 
and freshman.

nents and the 
girls have far ex
ceeded my ex
pectations for 
them this year. 
The Tartans 
then faced a 
string of their 
tougher oppo
nents this year. 
They were 
downed by West 
Liberty 9-0 and 
then traveled to 
face Gannon 
and Mercy
hurst. Gannon 
also downed the 
Tartans 9-0 and, Mercyhurst 
barely pulled out a 5-4 win. A
and leading the team this semes
ter, said head coach Peter Moss. 
He also noted that Lin and junior 
Namita Amin have come together 
to play well at the second doubles 
position.
The women travelled this week
end to take part in a tournament 
in Washington, D.C. Moss noted 
that the women were looking for
ward to this tournament, espe
cially after their improved play.
The mens team recently played 
in the Rolex Small College Cham
pionships at Swarthmore College. 
The team didnt do as well as I 
had hoped, said Moss.
Moss commented on the fact 
that he felt the mens team is 
doing much better this year. I
feel that we are stronger both in 
singles and in doubles, said Moss.
The mens team finishes up 
their season again Catholic Uni
versity and Case Western Re
serve. We are really looking 
forward to the match against 
Case, said Moss. They beat us 
9-0 last year and we want re
venge.

older but the Carnegie Mellon 
nens and womens cross country 
ams have continued to warm 
lP for the stretch drives of their 
espective seasons, which will 
iad them to the UAA tourna
ment in a mere two weeks.
t weekend, the mens and 
womens team both did excepionally well at the Hiram Invitaional meet. The men wound up 
running the meet, finishing far

Western.
'Junior Scott Moore was the star 
the meet for the Tartans as he

Oore and the other Tartan runers competed with runners from 
!Veral other schools including

This past weekend, Moore 
again led the charge for the Tar
tans, as they finished fourth 
amoung 30 schools at a meet 
hosted by Dickinson College. 
Moore finished with a time of 
26:43 and helped to compile a 
total overall score of 137 points

Meanwhile, the Tartan women 
refused to take a backseat to the 
success of the mens team as they 
went out and took first place over
all at the Hiram Invitational.

contributed to the winning score

 Dario Donatelli
for the Tartans.
As for the next two weeks pre
ceding UAAs, head coach Gary 
Meekly appears to be cautiously 
optimistic, for according to him, 
If we can get the entire team 
healthy, we can be respectable, 
but it seems like there is a virus 
going around campus, and we 
always have at least one third of
of 41 points, but the star of the 
meet was junior Melissa Bautert 
who finished with an overall win
ning time of 20:59.
Other impressive perfor
mances were turned in by sopho
more Becky Buchheit (fourth 
overall), junior Sangita Jinwaia 
(fifth overall), freshman Melissa 
Lott (11 th overall) and sophomore
Mahalynn Lu (21st overall).
According to head coach Dario 
Donatelli, the course, by accident, 
was 200 meters too long, and thus 
the times were a bit slow.
The Tartan women finished 
third out of an overall 30 teams, 
at the Dickinson meet. The win
ner was Gettyburg College and 
was followed by Allentown Col
lege in second.
Baustert again led the way for 
the Tartans, as she finished sec
ond overall with a time of 19:05. 
She was followed by Buchheit, 
who finished in 12th place with a 
time of 19:59, Jinwaia in 13th 
with a time of 20:02, Lott (19th 
place  20:08), freshman Laura 
Monhamayer (63rd21:37) and 
Lu (67th 21:47).
According to Donatelli, Every
one ran very good races.
He also said that this was a 
very good primer for UAAs. I feel 
good because our top four run
ners were running excellent 
races, and Melissa Baustert will 
have a chance to win the womens 
race at UAAs.

Dhh, 
Since Coach Bill Cowher has 
begun to build his championship 
Steeler team they have had the 
following trends ofinconsistency: 
the Steeiers win any game they 
play on Monday Night Football 
against anyone, and kill any team 
they play at home on Monday. 
They cant win in Seattle or Den
ver. They dont play well on grass. 
They never put away a bad team 
and yet they hardly ever get blown 
out by a good" or even great 
team. The last two seasons Barry 
Foster has seldom posted two 100- 
yard games in a row. The Steeiers 
always get their turnovers and 
sacks in bunches (four intercep
tions one week, none the next). 
And this year: Neil ODonnell and 
the offensive line tends to have 
one good game and then one bad, 
then another good game and 
then....

Pittburgh Steeiers trounced the 
Houston Oilers 30-14. The 
Steeiers dominated the Oiler of

probably should have won the

did the same thing to the Buffalo

winning by a score of 23-0. Back

One word describes ev

consistency.-To wii} the 
Super Bowl, a team must
meet a lot of requirements: _____
solid defense, good wide 
receivers, a reliable run
ning back, good special teams, 
smart coach, good front office, 
and plenty of luck. Aftfer all that 
they still need to learn, consis
tency. This year with the addi
tion of Bam Morris to back up 
Barry Poster and Charles 
Johnson and Andre Hastings as 
receivers who actually catch the 
ball, the Steeiers have just about 
met every requirement on the 
list. The Steeiers are even lucky 
at times. Ask A1 Del'Greco after 
his field gpal bounced off the cross
bar last week. But they have not

ample of the 1994 Vikings was 
given at the beginning of the col
umn, and over the years there 
have been many other examples. 
But keep one thing in mind. The 
Steeiers last and largest hurdle 
to jump over before they can go to 
the Super Bowl is their inconsis
tency problem. All that Steeler 
fans can do now is just not get too 
high on the Steeiers when they 
destroy a team like Houston, but 
not get too low when they throw 
away a game like the one in Se

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  10 October 1994
Football teams strategy changes with opposition
Defensive coordinator provides a look inside the Carnegie Mellon defense
By JOHN WEBER
MyMAyX SAyEEfMIAhM
While the offense has its spejjjcgame plan to score as many 
mints as possible, the CMU footlall teams defensive game plan 
depends on what our oppo
nents do, said Defensive Coordiiator Terry Bodnar.
To figure out exactly what each 
,pponent is going to do at any 
ven time, an intricate informaon gathering, processing, and 
nalyzing system has been setup 
iythe Tartan football team with 
jie eventual goal of formulating 
game plan for each of the Tarans opponents.
Gathering information about 
,ach opponent starts with the 
ideo camera. Every team video
apes their games and in the UAA 
hey are required to send tapes of 
it least three games (if possible)
I their upcoming opponent.
In other words, the Tartan 
aching staff will have tapes of 
t least three Washington Uniersity games to work with bejrethey actually face off against 
iem this coming Saturday.
'All the offensive plays are then 
roken down (in order) and put 
nto a Macintosh program called 
'andorama.
Each play is broken down into 
!veral categories, such as the 
stance it covered, where the 
ne of scrimmage was, what hash
mark the ball was on, the forma
tion of the offense, the backfield 
set, and the type of play itself.
Once the coaching staff feels 
that it has sufficient information 
on a given opponent, it can begin 
analyzing the information.
Thekeywordinthe 
analyzing process is 
AhXdhXkIhnl
Bodnar told me 
that everyone has 
tendencies, you just 
have to get enough 
film.
There are two ten
dencies that a team 
may have, down and 
distance tendencies 
and formation ten
dencies.
For example, a 
team may run the 
ball a lot on second 
down and long to go.
Thats an obvious 
down and distance 
tendency. Or a team 
may pass a lot from a 
two tight end forma
tion. That would be 
an obvious forma
tion tendency.
Down and dis
tance tendencies are 
broken down into 
first and 10 at the 
beginning of the series, first and 
10 during the series, and second 
and third down in long, medium
and short situations. Once you 
know that a team tends to run on 
second and long, you want to know 
which way they tend to run. (For 
example they can run off tackle, 
inside, outside, toward one wide 
receiver, toward two wide receivers, etc.)
Once the coaching staff has an 
idea what their opponent is going
to do in a certain situation, they plan tells them the possible plays 
can choose defensive plays that that will be effective. The 
will counteract their opponent in opponents plays are then scripted 
that situation. Each situation in practice to give the defense a 
calls for a certain set of plays and feel for what their upcoming opthe sum of all the situations and ponent is going to try to do and 
defensive plays to counteract each how they should react.
The same process 
holds true for oppo
nents with forma
tion tendencies ex
cept that defensive 
plays are chosen to 
counteract a certain 
formation (which 
may be as subtle as a 
flanker or backfield 
set) instead of what 
the team does in a 
certain situation. 
Bodnar told me that 
you can also have a 
combination of the 
two tendencies.
For example, in a 
game a few weeks 
ago, when the Tar
tans wanted to pres
sure the quarterback, 
they picked their 
base pressure play 
based on the 
backfield set of the 
opponent, but when 
the Tartans played
zone they picked the 
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Co-Editor base z(me play
one is the defenses game plan, based on the down and distance 
For each situation the defense tendency of the opponent, 
finds themselves in, the game There is also flexibility in the
defensive game plan. Bodnar told 
me that the biggest asset we 
have is their [the defenses] intel
ligence. Intelligence and good 
judgment allows the defense to 
change their game plan with mini
mal confusion.
For example, in case the Tar
tans opponent goes to the no 
huddle offense each player has 
several wristband plays. The 
number of the play to be used is 
then shown to the defense from 
the sideline so that the defense 
knows what to do.
Also, in addition to the regular 
game plan, an alternative game 
plan is drawn up in case the regu
lar game plan doesnt work.
And finally, Bodnars assistants 
in the press box update him on 
the ongoing tendencies through
out the game so that adjustments 
can be made on the field.
The Tartans will play their first 
UAA conference game against 
Washington University in St. 
Louis this Saturday. Kickoff will 
be at 1:30 pm Central Time.
Saturday, October 22, is the 
Tartans next home game and is 
also another UAA game. This one 
will be against the University of 
Chicago and kickoff will be at 
1:30 pm.
That game is the start of three 
straight home games, with the 
other two against Rochester and 
Grove City College.

Summer Study in Southern France:

The summer programs in Germany 
and Spain both involve a six-week study 
of the language, either German or Span
ish, at CMU, and then a four-week sum
mer study course in the respective coun
try.
The preliminary on-campus part of 
both the German and Spanish study 
programs involves classroom instruc
tion, language lab work, drills, films and 
discussions of contemporary Spanish and 
German societies. The second part of the 
German program is held at the Goethe 
Institute in Rothenburg, Germany, and 
the second part of the Spanish program 
is held at Estudio Internacional Sampere 
(EIS) in Madrid.
The French summer programs are in

program lasts six weeks, and as do 
the other two summer programs to 
Germany and Spain, earns 18 full CMU 
credits.
Overall, the Study Abroad Program 
offers many interesting and rare oppor
tunities to undergraduate students. 
Evamaria Mergner, the Study Abroad 
advisor at CMU, said, I think that the 
Study Abroad is actually amazingly suc
cessful, especially for such a technically 
oriented school. At CMU (as opposed to 
other universities) we actually have a 
lot of engineers and scientists and 
artists going abroad. 
j* As for any changes in the future, the Study Abroad Program 
' and Office of International Education 
continue to explore options for funding 
Study Abroad. The national trend, ac
cording to Mergner, is to move into the 
Third World, and for this reason, there 
is a larger amount of money available to 
students who want to study in nontraditional countries (not Western Eu
ropean countries).

Curtis explained that she returned 
with a firmer sense of what it means to 
be American, and of how we are per
ceived in the world.
Ive found that Americans are very 
superficial and they'll talk to you about 
your major, your this, your that, and 
they dont want to know more. Whereas 
Europeans, on the whole, really want to 
get to know you, they really want a sense 
of who you are.
I even had a little bit of reverse cul
ture shock (upon return). Americans are 
generally more ... flamboyant than Eu
ropeans. I got used to the French sense 
of being, which is a lot more closed; they 
dont talk about things ... it was just a 
very big challenge for me coming back, 
just getting used to it again.
Curtis said that although she made 
the decision to study abroad at a very 
late date, the ensuing application pro
cess was very straight forward.
They were the easiest applications 
Ive ever filled out in my life.... About 
three weeks before I went, I called the 
study abroad center here .... I talked to 
them and they said that they still had 
openings in the Tours program and three 
weeks later I was on a plane.
Curtis went on to stress the impor
tance of the study abroad experience for 
all CMU students, regardless of major.

junior mass communications major at 
Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios 
Superiores de Monterrey in Mexico, said 
Studying in another culture is not a mat
ter of just a school change, it is also a 
change in habits such as sleeping hours, 
meal hours ... [you] get to know the new 
culture, and get to know the new place 
where you are staying. You have more Xhf 
things to work with.
Tomomi Ito, a senior theatre and arts 
management major at Keio University in 
Tokyo, Japan, said, The teachers are more 
dedicated to their profession than the 
teachers in Japan. The students partici
pation is active. The most amazing thing 
about CMU is the computer network. I 
feel like Im living in 21st century al
ready. Topics including dorm life, the 
computer systems here at CMU, and meth
ods of teaching inspired reflection on their 
native cultures.
For example, David Mendez-Vives, a 
senior economics and business studies 
major at Universitt Pompeu Fabra in 
Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, said, I think 
that in undergraduate studies the diffi
culty level is quite the same, with the 
difference that in CMU theres a higher 
emphasis in practice and homework, while 
in Europe we have more classes per week 
but have milder homeworks. As a result, 
in CMU you spend more hours working 
than you do in Europe, but its more fun. 
Mendez-Vives also said, At the per
sonal level it has been really enriching for 
me. New people, new ways to do things, 
beingreally away fromfrom home.... Some
times its hard, but at the end I think one 
becomes a better person.
I consider my study abroad experience 
to be an integral part of my education, 
both personal and academic,  said Kristen 
Uhler, a CFA senior who spent last spring 
in Rome, Italy, studying art.
Immersion in a place and culture for
eign to ones own brings up a lot of issues 
about identity.
Although CMU students have studied 
in places as disparate as France, Mexico, 
and everywhere in between, Uhlers state
ment concerning the validity and impor
tance of experiencing another culture is a 
common theme throughout these students 
accounts.
You can learn anything in the class
room. You can just pick up a book and read 
it, but its very difficult to get a sense of 
another culture, said Kimberly Curtis, a 
creative writing and LCS major who spent 
all of last year in France.
In an interview Thursday, Curtis said 
that she chose to study abroad because, I 
was really burnt out from CMU and I just 
really wanted to get away from the college 
lifestyle.
Last fall Curtis participated in the CMUrun Tours program, about an hour and a 
half away from Paris. When this program 
was terminated last spring, Curtis chose 
to remain in France and enrolled in the 
American Institute for Foreign Study.
I went there and I didnt speak any 
French when I walked in (the Tours pro
gram), and it ended up being wonderful.... 
Its just a really great way to see a culture 
thats different from our own. When youre
This year, 23 undergraduate students 
and nine graduate students temporarily 
joined Carnegie Mellons campus commu
nity by participating in a study abroad 
program that their respective universities 
have arranged with Carnegie Mellon. The 
foreign exchange students are given the 
opportunity to immerse themselves in an 
alien culture while continuing their acai- demie and personal growth. Through in
teraction with exchange students, the 
study abroad program also provides ben
efits to students at the host university.
Linda Melville, a counselor at the Inter
national Office of Education, said, Study 
! abroad increases our understanding of the 
, world and provides advantages both to the 
^dividual participants and to society as a 
whole. Melville also said, Participants

know people from that culture while at the 
1 same time sharing their own culture with 
.their hosts. This cultural exchange brings 
diversity to the campus and can help to 
dispel stereotypes and break down culitural barriers.
When questioned about their experi
ences as foreign exchange students, inter
national students tended to highlight the 
differences between their university experience and CMU. Jorg Kienzle, a junior

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  10 October 1994
95 international festival takes 
Europe to campuss front door
By DEENA NEWSOM
ByMAyX SAyEEfMIAhM
On Thursday, October 20, Carnegie 
Mellons fourth International Festi
val will officially begin. This year, the 
Festival will showcase Europe, with 
close to 50 countries represented.
Its bigger than it has ever been, 
says Jill Goodall, junior psychology 
student and assistant coordinator of 
the International Festival.
We could only cover a limited num
ber of countries with the bigger pro
grams.... The most diversity will be 
seen in the food and the crafts on the 
Saturday of the Festival.
The events ofthe International Fes
tival will be held all over campus. 
There will be two outdoor tents set up 
for events, the Marketplace and Tent 
Europa. The Marketplace will house 
the bands, food and crafts, and the 
Monte Carlo Casino Night. Tent 
Europa will house lectures, education 
awards, European folk stories pre
sented by the Drama Department, 
and the AB concert featuring John 
Wesley Harding.
A new addition to the International 
Festival celebration will be signposts 
placed at various locations on campus 
that will display the mileage from 
Pittsburgh to the capitals of several 
European countries.
Anne Witchner, assistant dean of 
Student Affairs and coordinator of 
the International Festival, said, One 
of the great things about the Interna
tional Festival is that its a campus 
wide effort.... Everyone can be a part 
of this big umbrella.
In fact, everyone from Ballroom 
Dancing to several academic depart
ments has gotten involved in the Fes
tival. Students from the Drama de
partment will be presenting Euro
pean folk tales. The Hewlett Gallery will 
be presenting an exhibit of the works of 
Stefan Stirbu, a contemporary Roma
nian artist. SDC will be providing sev
eral films, including SkcIXdrhM1n LInAl 
The list goes on and on.
It was my goal to expand the pro
gram, said Witchner. She did this by 
scheduling several preview events prior 
to the actual weekend of the Festival.
The preview events this year began on 
September 22, with a lecture given by 
Joseph Rudman of CMUs English de
partment on Daniel DeFoe: Espionage, 
Propaganda, and the Shaping of Great 
Britain. Also, on October 8, the College 
Bowl sponsored the European Trivia 
Bowl.
Upcoming preview events include a 
lecture on October 11 by CMU Design 
Professor Craig Vogel entitled Why Do 
We Buy European Products?
There will also be a guided tour of the 
University of Pittsburghs Nationality 
Classrooms on October 15, and a trip to 
the United States Holocaust Museum in 
Washington, D.C. on October 16. The 
week prior to the Festival will be filled 
with exhibits, films, personal journey 
speakers, ballroom dancing lessons, and 
other activities concerning European cul
ture.
Witchner said the purpose of these 
preview activities is to allow the stu
dents more opportunities to learn about 
Europe and to whet peoples appetites 
for the actual Festival.
The highlights of the Festival, said 
Goodall, are the keynote lectures, of 
course, but there are also films every 
night ofthe week and personal journeys, 
many of which are given by students or 
faculty.
Theres a Monte Carlo Night on Fri
day and a Costume Show on Saturday, 
and well be giving away prizes at both of 
those events. Theres a concert Thurs
day night and music all afternoon on 
Saturday. Plus, there will be a lot of 
European food at most of the events.
This year, the International Festi
val was purposely scheduled at the 
same time as Family Weekend. John 
Hannon, coordinator of Residence 
Life, said they did this because it 
brings more people to campus and 
allows the parents and families to be 
a part of something and learn with 
their students.
This years Family Weekend theme 
is Share the Experience. This year, 
students and their families will share 
the Carnegie Mellon Experience with 
events such as lectures on topics like 
tuition, the history of Carnegie 
Mellon, department meetings, recep
tions, a tour ofthe Robotics Institute, 
a Student Services Fair, and a Parent 
Panel Discussion, in addition to the 
International Festival events. There 
will also be bus tours of Pittsburgh 
and a tour of the Andy Warhol mu
seum.
The Family Weekend program, 
which was previously known as Par
ent Weekend has grown in the last 
few years. The attendance has gone 
from about 200 participating family 
members to the 1300 expected to at
tend this year.
Hannon attributes a lot of this to 
the recent combination of Family 
Weekend and the International Fes
tival.
With more events available to vis
iting family members of all ages, more 
people are willing to participate in 
Family Weekend. People are coming 
infrom all over, says Hannon, Weve 
even got people registered from as far 
as Colorado.
Both Family Weekend and the In
ternational Fesitval are scheduled 
for the weekend of October 20-22.
Campus recognizes 
gay/lesbian history
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN 
& SUSAN WATSON
ByMAyX SAyEEfMIAhMn
Though October has been labeled Na
tional Gay and Lesbian History Month, 
members of the homosexual community 
are hoping the acknowledgment of gay 
and lesbian rights will be continued 
throughout the year.
Harriet Schwartz, assistant to the dean 
of Student Affairs said, while celebrat
ing such a month might be helpful in 
creating an understanding of homosexu
als right now, Im afraid it might send 
the wrong message to the public. Be
cause this month has been set aside for 
homosexual awareness, some fear that 
this will lead to people ignoringthe issue 
for the remainder of the year. Despite 
this possibility, a number of activities 
have been scheduled during the month 
of October to emphasize the importance 
of gay and lesbian rights.
The celebration of the month started a 
few years back when a need to recognize 
famous gays and lesbians became neces
sary due to the lack of support in the 
community. Unlike other oppressed 
groups in this country, homosexuals 
didnt have a knowledge of their past to 
fall back on. This is why it is important 
to publicize the sexuality of leaders and 
other known figures, said Scott Safier, 
a senior research programmer in the 
Robotics Institute.
This is the first year that CMU is 
hosting events affiliated with National 
Gay and Lesbian History Month. One of 
the events that will be held this month is 
a rally dealing with the rights of gays 
and lesbians, but the exact time and 
place have yet to be confirmed.
Amoderated discussion withDr. Tony 
Sylvester on fifty years of gay and les
bian history will take place at the 
Hillman Library on Thursday, October
14 at 4:30 pm. A lecture by Dennis
Altman entitled AIDS: Community Or. 
ganizations as Subversive will begin a| 
4 pm in the Graduate School of Publii 
Health Auditorium.
Ani DiFranco, a feminist, poet, 
musician,and bisexual activist, will t; 
performing in Bellefield Hall on October
15 at 8 pm. This performance will bj 
sponsored by cmuOUT, Pitt Bisexual 
Gay and Lesbian Association, and the 
Womens Center.
By far, the most significant event taking place this month is on October 11, 
National Coming Out Day. It commemo
rates the 1987 Gay and Lesbian March 
on Washington, signifying the fact that 
such a community exists. If you cant be 
out and talking about what you are, it 
lessens who you are, said Sarah 
Pendergrass, a second year art major 
and member of CMUs gay, lesbian, ani 
bisexual community. This coincides with 
the beliefs of the famous leader Harvey 
Milk who emphasized the notion Silence Equals Death.
Milk was a popular San Francisto 
politician who became vocal about com. 
ing out. He felt it was an essential factor 
because it signified that homosexuals 
are not a seperate sect of society. Milks 
motto, Come out, come out where ever 
you are, urges those who are skeptical 
about publicizing their sexuality not to 
be afraid. Unfortunately, his belief was 
not shared by all, and he was assassi
nated.
According to Chris Newman, a CMU 
graduate and a current employee of Com
puting Services, Coming Out Day pro
vides for safety in numbers in that the 
more people coming out, the less chance 
of harassment from homophobic indi
viduals.
However, it is evident that ignorance 
prevails in many cases, and this does not 
exclude CMU. Most people on campus 
believe that no one they know is gay.

Professor works on movie
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
ByMAyX ShXITM SAyEEfMIAhM
Tim Satemow has spent the 
last two months scrutinizing old 
 newspaper archives for Hill Dis
trict photographs and searching 
' through dusty South Side antique 
' shops for brown patterned wall' paper, old bakelite light switches, 
and just the right shade of faded 
green linoleum for a battered 
kitchen floor.
Its a fabulous job, said 
Satemow, an assistant drama 
professor and the art director for 
Bch mIyXT LhnnTXb a film about 
the Hill District in the 1930s 
thats being filmed in Pittsburgh
- this fall.
The film is based on the Pulitzer 
prize-winning play written by 
August Wilson that opened on 
Broadway in 1988. It tells the 
story of a piano carved with the 
entire visual history of an Afri
can-American family who were 
once slaves on a plantation. The 
movies cast includes Charles Roc 
Dutton, former Broadway actor 
and star of the television comedy 
Roc, who plays Boy Willie.
As art director, my job was to 
run the art department. In addi
tion to that, I designed all the 
sets and made sure they were 
drafted and built properly. I or
dered all the materials that were 
added on, like the wallpaper, 
said Satemow.
The film is directed by Lloyd 
Richards, who directed the play 
on Broadway and during its pre
miere at Yale. Ive worked with 
both [Richards] and [Wilson] be
fore and they knew me. I think 
that was a plus. It helped a lot in 
communications and knowing 
how [Richards] directs, said 
Satemow, who worked on the play 
when it opened at Yale in 1987.
Bch mIyXT LhnnTX is one of a set
of Pittsburgh-based plays writ
ten by Wilson that represent each 
decade of the twentieth century. 
Wilsons other plays include the 
1960s-era BfT BMyIXn gHXXIXi 
and CTh BHMXhMzn sTth yXd 'TXh, 
which takes place in the 1950s.
Theyre all about Pittsburgh. 
Its really his memories of the 
Hill District and about what that 
vital African-American commu
nity was like and how its been 
slowly destroyed in this century, 
said Satemow.
Learning what the Hill District 
was like dining that decade was 
difficult. We had to go back and 
find out what Pittsburgh looked 
like in the 1930s. Its almost im
possible to find research about 
Wiley Avenue in the 1930s. No
body was taking pictures up there 
except the black newspaper, the

Phi Kappa Theta wins 
title of Mr. Fraternity
By NATALIE WOCHELE
ByMAyX CHXITM SAyEEfMIAhM
Brian McNally had little to say after 
being named Mr. Fraternity Friday 
night. It feels good, said the contestant 
from Phi Kappa Theta.
Many students, especially freshmen, 
may not understand the true purpose of 
the Mr. Fraternity 
contest. Some may 
mistakenly believe 
that it's just a ma
cho beauty pag
eant,but the events 
true purpose is to 
raise money for 
charity. Hosted by 
Kappa Alpha 
Theta, Mr. Frater
nity allows one
member from each Jason Seigendorf/Tartan Photographer
fraternity to com- Contestants line up for the judges.
pete in a variety of
events including swim wear, toga, for
mal wear, and talent. At the end of the 
evening, the winner is crowned Mr. Fra
ternity once the Thetas tally up the 
judges scores.
The event started eight years ago when 
one of the sisters from Kappa Alpha 
Theta, Karin Johnson, died of an acute 
asthma attack. As a memorial to 
Johnson, all the proceeds from the con
test go to her asthma research fund, in
furthering asthma research. Karin is 
remembered by many as a warm, outgo
ing person, who was deeply involved 
with CMU and its Greek community, 
said Mr. Fraternity chairperson, Tara 
Zane.
Although all contestants put on their 
best efforts representing their respec
tive houses, a couple stood out. Mr. Delta 
Upsilon, Chris 
Maples was very 
impressive in the 
Beach, Toga, and 
Formal wear. His 
attire took a comi
cal approach, in
cluding plastic 
posterior, utters, 
and a glow in the 
dark suit. Mr. 
Phi Kappa Theta, 
though not as im
pressive with his 
outfits, more than 
made up ground in the talent portion of 
the competition, where he performed a 
splendid magic show.
Usually, in magic, objects are pulled 
from out of a hat, but Brian McNally 
decided to use a different twist by pull
ing items out of his pants. The crowd 
broke into rapture, chanting McNallys 
given nickname, Barbie! By the end of 
the evening, the crowd was undoubtedly 
in support of McNally. Soon enough, the

land program, but there was an engi
neer in our program who was able to 
work it out. The program is mostly 
humanities, and I dont know if its 
possible for engineers to sum up all of 
their necessary (humanities) courses 
into one semester, but if they could, 
its definitely worth the experience. 
As for H&SS students, I know were 
capable of doing it.
Jeanie Kim, a senior in IM and 
economics, spoke about her experi
ences at the American University of 
Paris:
The reason I went was to get away 
from CMU. Im fluent in French and I 
want to go into international busi
ness. I wanted to really live by myself
in a different culture. It makes you grow 
a lot faster than you would here.... Every 
now and then you have to get away from 
the situation youre in. If you dont you 
end up being stagnant.
Although she praised the study abroad 
experience highly, Kim had no acclaim 
for the manner in which the University 
facilitates the program.
International education is not a pri
ority at CMU and it should be if they 
want to a be forefront in the world.... The 
semester I decided to study abroad they 
closed down [the Tours program] so I 
had to scramble and find another pro
gram .... I think that was a very bad 
thing for them to do because the market 
is becoming really international. Any 
industry that you go into: IS, computer
science, any program that CMU of
fers would really benefit from inter
national education.
Any way you look at it, the study 
abroad is an opportunity which many 
students feel should not be over
looked.
Most students feel that achieving 
personal growth through any experi
ence is a worthwhile endeavor.
College is purgatory; its the time 
between high school and what youre 
going to do for the rest of your life, 
said Curtis.
Going abroad really gave me a 
sense of that... learning things at this 
school means more to me now, just 
because I have a greater sense of 
what else is out there.
Dont hit me, Im only a student
the hopes of providing medical care and judges showed that they agreed.

Gays/lesbians strive 
for sexual freedom
GAYS, from page L2
This, ofcourse,isnottrue. Once people 
realize that someone close to them is 
gay, they tend to be more receptive to 
homosexuality. People need to realize 
that homosexuals are real people. 
They are people they know, love and 
care about, Newman said.
Historically, violence against gays 
and lesbians along with a widespread 
feeling that homosexuality is wrong, 
discourages those individuals who are 
gay from coming 
out of the closet.
Declan McCullagh, a senior cog
nitive science 
major and Stu
dent govern
ment president 
finds that, In a 
residence hall
there is a lot of pressure to stay clos
eted, since most floors are consisted of 
the same sex. Especially in the male 
dorms where there is a predominately 
macho attitude that encompasses the 
living environment.
McCullagh feels that coming out is
a vital part of coming to terms with 
ones self. It is important to be honest 
with yourself more than with anyone 
else.
Coming out was the best thing that 
has happened to Newman. I came 
out during my senior year because I 
hadnt dealt with the issues to accept 
myself. Fear ran my life. I have a life 
now Beforfe, Xavoided all sexualexpe- , 
riences. Now, I can do what I want. 
Pendergrass said, You come out in 
d i f f e r e n t

to be a lesbian. 
Sarah Pendergrass
ways every 
year. In a 
sense, you 
are always 
finding new 
things out 
about your
self and your 
sexuality. I 
want everyone to know how proud I 
am to a be a lesbian. It is a personal 
day for me and for many people in the 
homosexual community because we 
can say that we are gay, we are les
bian, we are bisexual, we are not 
straight.
Ever since I changed my meal plan 
from Constant Pass to Blocks n stuff, 
Ive had to cross Forbes Avenue over to 
Morewood a lot of times. One day I 
thought Id look closely at the rest of the 
student bodys crossing habits.
The first thing I found was that the 
words DONT WALK do not have an 
impression on most students unless 
theres a slew of cars coming up or going 
down Forbes. As long as theyre stopped 
safely at the red light and no one is 
gunning the engine, most students feel 
they have free reign to cross Forbes.
It doesnt matter whats coming off of
Morewood Avenuemost students take 
their good ol time crossing and if a car 
turning right onto Forbes almost hits 
said students, the student gives the 
driver a mean look straight in the eye as 
if the driver should know damn well that 
a CMU student is crossing and hed 
better stop for some strange unwritten 
rule.
Well, what if the driver doesnt stop?
The student probably weighs around 
120 pounds and is traveling one mile per 
hour. The car weighs about 3000 pounds 
and is traveling around 30 miles per 
hour. Use that conservation of momen
tum thing y*all learned in Physics I and 
maybe youll see who/whats going to 
win (I dont want to ruin the suspense 
for the physics-illiterate that tries to 
cross with cars coming off of Morewood).
And if the car hits, whats the student 
going to do? Sue the driver? The judge 
would probably like to see this rule that 
cars have to stop for CMU students, no 
matter what the WALK/DONT WALK 
sign says.
End result: The driver sues the stu
dent for damage to the car, and the 
students injuries will mean squat to the 
State.
Then there are those tenuous moments 
when the light on Forbes turns red and 
the students start to cross. Ive noticed 
the students go slowwwwwwwwly across 
the street and then speed up after the 
DONT WALK changes to WALK 
Shouldnt the reverse of this be true? 
What if Psycho Driver thinks he can run 
the red light and we have students just 
slowwwwwwly traipsing across the 
street?
And worse yet are the people that find 
it fitting to engage themselves in con
versation right in the middle of Forbes. 
Is a conversation worth the risk of get
ting splattered? It better be a damn good 
one. Hopefully about conservation of 
momentum.

photographs from the 1930s and dupli
cate the details in the movie, he said.
I did sketches and watercolors and 
then built models to show the director. 
At first, we did all designs , on paper. 
[When you need to go beyond that], thats 
when it really works. Thats when you 
have to draft beautifully. Theres a con
nectedness to this thats tough to do in a 
school setting. We try to duplicate this 
in ourtheater productions,but this is at 
another level, he said.
Its great to take students youve had 
in a class and put them in another set
ting. Being able to hire my students to. 
work with me benefits everybody. Im
given the great opportunity to continue 
them in a professional situation, and 
thats the best, said Saternow. He hired 
two graduate students, Kristen Loeffler 
and Michael Earl as assistant art direc
tors. Ben Carter, a drama department 
staff carpenter, carved the family his
tory into the pianos used in the movie. 
Drama staff member Norman Beck was 
also a carpenter on the movie.
The indoor scenes in The Piano Lesson 
are being filmed at a studio in RIDC 
park, formerly an American Roller Bear
ing Company factory. For the outdoor 
scenes, the film company renovated a 
house in Shadyside, in addition to film
ing at Fricks birthplace, the trolley
museum, and the north sides Garden 
Theater.
Saternow was hired as art director 
after hearing about the film through the 
mayors office. I learned about this 
through the mayors office. Pittsburgh 
has a fairly healthy film business going
 Pittsburghs popular because it looks 
like New York but it isnt as expensive to 
film here, he said.
I hadnt made a movie for five years, 
and I had made a determined decision 
not to work in television any more, said 
Saternow.
This movie fit into my schedule and 
worked out really well. The people Im 
working with are fabulous.
Extended hours at computer may cause physical problems
TkHnhd TX Ach WXAhMXhA
by Kenton Shaver
In recent weeks, health has 
been a big issue on campus. No 
one is impervious to flus and bugs, 
and certainly not computer us
ers, who tend to put their sleep 
cycles in flux and sport habits of 
abusing their bodies in the name 
of uptime. Here are some guide
lines that heavy computer users 
may benefit from hearing:
The most important issue for 
computer users is carpal tunnel 
syndrome, a condition caused by 
the inflammation of muscles sur
rounding the nerves that lead 
from the wrist to the finger tips, 
causing numbness or loss of feel
ing in the fingers.
Overpressing and pounding on 
the keyboard encourages carpal 
tunnel, as does the resting of the 
heels of ones hands on the desktop while typing. To prevent the 
latter, I try to keep my keyboard 
at the edge of the desk so that my 
wrists are not in contact with the 
desktop at all. It may be some 
help, to have a soft pad between 
the wrist and the desktop if they 
are in contact, but better not to 
have them so.
Discouragement of planting 
your wrists on your desk as you 
type demands a desk that doesnt 
stand too high relative to your 
chair.
Also, a computer monitor rest
ing on a low desktop reduces eye 
strain. Your monitors top 
shouldnt be higher than your 
eyes.
Until I started making sure of 
this, my own eyes, which can get 
terribly dry, quickly irritated 
when I used the computer. Look
ing down at your computer screen 
allows you to keep your eyes fur
ther closed in addition to elimi
nating the neck strain that re
sults when continually craning 
ones neck to read the monitor.
It will also bring the screen 
more easily into focus  every
thing is in focus for a pinhole 
camera, after alland encourge 
you to maintain a safe distance 
from your radiation-emitting 
CRT, which is vaguely suspected 
of being a carcinogenic hazard.
Ah, the chair. I detested the 
form-fitting, cushy chairs in the 
public clusters in bygone days. I 
think just looking at one of them 
encourged the sitter to waste 
time.
At my own terminal, I have a 
French hardback chair. Cushy 
chairs eventually give me prob
lems, because my back, with the 
help of a large neurofibroma, 
alerts me when my posture is 
sub-optimal.
Look-aways and color scheme 
selection are two more devices 
that benefit ones health. Once 
every half hour or so, look away 
from the screen and read that 
wall clock down the hall or gaze 
out the cluster window to exer
cise your eyes.
Ifyou are using a color monitor, 
you may find that pale yellow (I 
have moccasin) text on a dark 
blue background is the easiest on 
the eyes.
Im sure that your friendly clus
ter consultant would be quite 
happy to help you set this up. 
Reading little black text on a de
fault, screaming paper white 
background eventually gives me 
a headache.

Play reveals little about Italian life
By RICHARD SMOLEN
ByMAyX SAyEEfMIAhM
Besides a nicely staged curtain call, one 
of the few good reasons to see the Pitts
burgh Public Theaters production of 
Eduardo de Filippos SyAHMdyab SHXdyab
2TXdyab is to see one of Americas most 
versatile-performers in the role she origi
nated on Broadway in 1974. Jan Miner 
who has been seen numerous times on 
stage and screen, including 27 years as 
Madge in Palmolive commercials  spurs 
us to the brink of laughter with but a 
single gesture that reveals how deeply she 
has internalized the character of Aunt 
Meme, and then she sends us over the 
edge with con^ic understatement and im
peccably timed delivery. Indeed, she steals 
the show when she In on stage  which is 
all too seldom, unfortunately; although 
the whole wifrld may revolve around Aunt 
Meme, the play does not.
SyAHMdyab SHXdyab 2TXdya tells the 
story of a typical weekend in the life of an 
Italian family. Family problems, especially 
the marital troubles of Rosa (Lauren Klein) 
and Peppino (Richard Venture), over
shadow the main event: Sundays dinner, 
for which Rosa has meticulously prepared 
the MyiHl Egos are bruised and 
relationships are strained, but 
everything ends happily ever 
after  and the Priore family 
will surely do it again next 
weekend.
Eduardo de Filippo, consid
ered by many as one of the 
greatest Italian playwrights, 
serves us this slice of life in the 
style of the kTMcthdIy dhrrzyMAh (comedy of left, actors had to stand downstage left to
onymous. Everything is realistic about the 
set; every detil is Italian, from the stucco 
on the walls to the polished wooden floors, 
to the design on the dinner plates. The 
lighting is naturalistic; there is even a 
noticeable difference from Act I (late after
noon, Saturday) to Act II (early afternoon, 
Sunday). The smell of Italian cooking  
onions mostly  is piped throughout the 
theater. The actors all make valiant at
tempts at Italian accents (some succeed, 
some fail miserably), and the beginning 
and ending of acts are highlighted by Ital
ian music. 2ytty tAy Im sure, given 
enough time and money, that the produc
tion team could have found a way to engage 
our other two senses.
Dominating the set is the huge rectangu
lar dinner table, long enough to seat most of 
the dinner guests on one side. When this 
idea was proposed in production meetings, 
it probably sounded like a good way to solve 
the problem of: How do you seat 14 Ital
ians around a table so that the audience 
can see all of them? But the unlucky audiin an agonizingly slow five seconds; yes, it 
was natural, but a quick yank would have 
been more dramatic.
Brown was hindered by the unequal levels 
of skill among the cast. The London pre
miere of SyAHMdyab SHXdyab 2TXdyab di
rected by Franco Zeffirelli, won the Evening 
Standard Award for Best Play of 1973, 
with Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright 
in lead roles. Arvin Brown didnt have that 
level of talent with which to work, but Lauren 
Klein and Richard Venture were solid as 
Peppino and Rosa; Dominic Chianese was 
no Olivier, but gave a strong performance as 
the grandfather Antonio. Peter Rini as 
Federico delivered his lines with the right 
mix of emotion and conviction; he was one of 
the few actors without TV or movie credits, 
and he used his entire body, not just his face, 
to make the awkward place of the young 
fianc6 at the family dinner a reality. But 
from there, the acting dropped off consider
ably. In the role of the maid Virginia, 
Stephanie Silverman was embarrassing. She 
flitted about the stage like a bird, whining
ence members sitting in the left section of incessantly, casting unmotivated glances,
the three-quarter arrangement at the Pub
lic saw the backs of heads during Act II. 
And, since the table was so large, and on a 
diagonal from downstage right to upstage
"... one wonders why the Pittsburgh 
Public Theater opened its twentieth 
anniversary season with such a rela
tively unimportant play. 
professional players), which uses stock 
characters as a basis- for improvisation. 
The characters in de-Filippos play are all 
recognizable-stereotypes: the foolish old 
man, Antonio (Dominic Chianese); the mis
chievous servant, Virginia (Stephanie 
Silverman); arid the young lovers, 
Giulianella and Federico (Marin Hinkle 
and Peter Rim).
Lending life to the kTtthdIy dhrrzyMAh is 
improvisation; SyAHMdyab SHXdyab 2TXP
dya approximates this with some jokes 
and funny situations, but there are not 
nearly enough. Comedy is better served on 
a proscenium stage the Publics threequarter arrangement worked against the 
director. The play itself is also rooted in 
naturalism (realism without higher ide
als), and events follow a logical course, so 
the designers took this approach to the 
production. In the twentieth century, we 
are obsessed with finding the distinction, 
if one exists, between life and art; this 
production dedares thajt the two are synaddress the group at the table collectively: 
it was an image repeated too often, causing 
sight line problems for another unlucky 
bunch sitting too far to the right in the 
center section.
Co-producing the play with the Pitts
burgh Public Theater was director Arvin 
Brown and the renowned Long Wharf The
atre of New Haven, Connecticut (which has 
seen its premieres of plays by Arthur Miller, 
David Mamet, and Eugene ONeill subse
quently move on to New York). Brown found 
enough business to occupy the actors on 
stage, but the careless blocking often pro
duced unclear stage pictures. Perhaps tooformal stage pictures would have been at 
odds with the naturalistic end to which he 
aimed. There was no build to the climax in 
Act II. The action stumbled over a bumpy 
road of fast and slow, funny and serious 
scenes, which makes for good sex, but notso-good theater. The climax itself was a 
sticky situation, mired in naturalism again. 
Rosa painfully twists off her wedding ring
and overreacting to the most insignificant 
events. As Giulianella, Marin Hinkles Ital
ian accent needed work and her movement 
lacked grace. It is surprising how many cast 
members list popular TV dra
mas and soap operas in their 
biographies. That is rather 
suitable for this play, which is 
essentially a three-hour sitcom 
set in Naples. The production 
raises questions, but not about 
social issues or morality, for de
__________ Filippo doesnt presume. In
fact, one wonders why the Pitts
burgh Public Theater opened its twentieth 
anniversary season with such a relatively 
unimportant play. And why did the famed 
Long Wharf Theatre, celebrating its thirti
eth anniversary, not only co-produce this 
play with the Public, but commission this 
production for a new translation  which 
revealed nothing new at all about the play? 
A better approach would have been to cut an 
hour and a half to compress the action. As it 
stands now, the only times SyAHMdyab SHXP
dyab 2TXdya comes alive is in the simple, 
vivid, compressed language of its too-infrequent jokes and one-liners. The rest of the 
language trickles past, a watered-down, col
orless solution of naturalistic dialogue be
hind which lurks a simplistic story that 
vaguely celebrates family and food, with no 
moral reflection other than that of life itself.

Cellist plays with 
passion,
By ADAM KL IVANS
ByMAyX CHXITM SAyEEfMIAhM
Every year, the Y Music Soci
ety sponsors a season of solo re
citals in the Carnegie Music Hall 
on Forbes Avenue. Last Wednes
day, world renowned cellist Yo 
Yo Ma took the stage for a virtu
ally all Bach performance. Fa
mous for his numerous record
ings and appearances, Ma has 
gained the reputation of being 
unarguably the worlds greatest 
living cellist. His recordings of 
the Dvorak Cello Concerto, 
Schubert Quintet in A major, 
and other such staples of the rep
ertoire stand out as milestones to 
which all other performances are 
compared. In this program of 
three Bach cello suites and a rela
tively new piece by composer 
David Wilde, I expected nothing 
but the finest cello playing from 
Ma. I was not disappointed.
As Ma began the Bach Cello 
SuiteNo. 4 in E-flat Major tBWV 
1010), I was struck by the depth 
and warmth of sound that his 
200-year-old cello could produce. 
Having never been to a solo cello 
recital before, I had no idea how 
deep and intense the sound of the 
instrument itself could be. The 
acoustics of the Carnegie Music 
Hall reverberated with the glori
ous tone of Mas cello.
Although hisplayingofthe pre
lude was a tad sloppy, his flaws 
quickly vanished with the begin
ning ofthe sarabande.The slower, 
more expressive movements of 
the suite demonstrate the true 
wonder of Mas playing. His 
smoothness combined with an 
unparalleled understanding of 
the music captured every second 
of the audiences attention. Ma 
attacked the final movement of 
the piece with a fiery passion and 
ferocity unequaled by his peers.
With the beginning ofthe Suite 
No. 2 in D minor (BWV 1008), 
Ma somehow managed to sur
pass his elegant performance of 
the previous suite. The suite in D 
minor is superiorly written to the 
previous suite in E-Flat Major, 
and Ma successfully demonstrated this. His playing of tlie 
suite was boldin expression, yet it 
brought out all of the subtleties 
which make the piece one of the 
most inspired works in the cello 
repertoire. Again, he concluded the 
suite with his usual technical wizardry, bringing out all ofthe power 
which Bach has instilled in the 
music.
After a brief intermission, Ma 
performed the only exception in 
this all Bach program: a modern 
work by English composer David 
Wilde. Wilde is better known as a 
piano player than a composer, and 
it should stay that way.
The piece, according to the pro
gram notes, was written in tribute 
to Vedran Smailovic, a Bosnian 
cellist who risks his life every day 
by playing to the memory of those 
who died in a brutal accident at a 
precinct in Sarajevo. Though it is 
nothing new to see an artist at
tempt to express a political ideal 
through music, it is extremely rare 
for that artist to make it work.
Wildes piece was an admirable 
attempt at a lament, but its nu
merous clichs and conflicting at
tempts at-expressioncreatea work 
that sounds quite dull. Even Mas 
graceful playing could not save 
this piece.Finally. Ma returned to 
a Bach suite to conclude his per
formance. The Suite No. 6 in D 
major, though not as dramatic as 
the one in D minor, has a charm all 
its own. As to be expected. Ma 
successfully captured the clever
ness of the piece, and his master
ful interpretation of the harmo
nies create what can arguably be 
called an authentic performance.
After his encore of an excerpt 
from the Bach Cello suite No. 3, 
I went backstage to try to meet 
Ma. I was amazed and impressed 
with the friendliness and honesty 
that he showed toward everyone 
who wanted to speak with him. An 
autograph would have satisfied 
m e, but Ma eagerly spoke with me 
about music for quite awhile. I left 
the performance that night 
amazed at both the beauty and 
wonder of Mas playing and the 
warm, charming qualities of his 
persona.

with restaurants offering a daz
zling view*-of the city to suit ev
eryone from the typical broke stu
dent to the debonair trendsetters 
we all want to become.
Because of my suffering bank 
account, I chose to try one of the 
more casual establishments on 
Mt. Washington: The Grandview 
Saloon. ThCrowd is young and 
the atmosphere, is relaxed, but 
the building itself adds a touch of 
class.
The restaurant is split into sev
eral layers,' with two outdoor pa
tios. The first level is the bar, 
which was packed arid bustling.
To escape the crowds, step out
side onto the patio and take in 
the sights and lights. Just a few 
yards away is the Duquesne In
cline. From the patio, it is pos
sible to see the faces of the pas
sengers.
One of the most impressive fea
tures of The Grandview Saloon is 
that nearly every table has a view. 
The dining areas are terraced so 
that even the people seated fur
thest from the window can see 
the city lights. During warm 
weather you may enjoy fresh air 
while you eat on the outdoor pa
tio located on the upper level. 
But, this place doesnt thrive 
from the view alone. The food 
is delicious and comes in huge 
servings. Even though the 
room was packed, the service 
was quick and friendly.
The Grandview Saloon 
doesnt take reservations, so 
there will almost certainly be 
a wait. Take advantage of the 
time by taking a romantic walk 
along Grandview Ave. It is also 
fun to watch the wide mix of 
people coming in and out of 
the restaurants. You might be 
interested in browsing 
through the antique store next 
door that stays open late. Make 
sure you take a ride on the 
Duquesne Incline and look at the 
pictures of inclines around the 
world. (Dont miss the picture of 
the shortest and steepest incline 
in the world from Dubuque, Iowa. 
It is a fond childhood memory of 
mine.)

Dirtbag hits paydirt on humor
sTtIk TT, 
scMTXIkrhn
by Jason Andrackl
Its time to take a break from 
the mainstream. This week, 
rather than review some book 
from DC, Marvel, or even Dark 
Horse, Im doing a brand new 
book, from a brand new pub
lisher, by a new talent that is 
well on his way to making a 
name for himself in the comic 
book industry. IMAxyib from 
Twist and Shout Comics and by 
Great Britains Richard 
Johnson, hit the stands at bet
ter comic book stores last week 
(I waited a week to get it by mail 
order).
IMAxyi is a new black and 
white book published by Johnson 
himself, who already lists to his 
credit the British Student Car
toonist of the Year award.
When describing IMAxyib the 
words eclectic, original, and 
imaginative immediately come 
to mind. After all, books about 
sentient trash heaps and their 
alien companions are pretty 
unique. Beats the hell out of 
your traditional carbon-copysuperhero team books that are a 
dime a dozen.
For a first effort, IMAxyi is 
very impressive. Not only is 
Johnsons writing and art very 
admirable, but before I even 
opened the book, he impressed 
me with the comic industry 
greats that he recruited for the 
first issues jam cover: Dave Sim 
$shMhxHn), Brian Bolland }Bch 
7IrrIXi CT,hb plus winner of the
Comic Book Buyers Guide award 
for Favorite Cover Artist), and 
Simon Bisley $LTxT>b are just a 
few of the big names that contrib
uted to this issues cover, with 
others already lined up for up
coming issues.
I found out about this book 
through Mr. Johnsons posts to 
topical bboards, like rec.arts. 
comics .info, and although I wasnt 
too interested, I eventually ended 
up eagerly anticipating the ar
rival of IMAxyi in my mail box (I 
must publicly thank Johnson for 
providing a way for those in both 
hemispheres to get his book if 
their local comic stores dont carry 
it).
After my first reading of 
IMAxyib I had the same feeling I 
did after reading my first issue of 
New England Comics BIk, (now
Richard Johnston Support independent comics by checking out Dirtbag. There's something in it for you, too.
a Saturday morning animated 
series). I actually laughed out 
loud at this book. I cant even 
remember the last comic (besides 
BIk,) that made me do that.
Johnsons most effective jokes 
were his shots at Americans. The 
American Revolution has long 
been over, but Johnson proves 
that the United States isnt the
only country that remembers it.
For only having 20 pages to 
work with, Johnson did a superb 
job introducing us to Dirtbag, the 
star of the series, and his (hers?, 
its? What sex would a talking 
trash pile be?) companion Midge 
Xypher.
Johnson also gives an exten
sive background on Dirtbag and 
Midge, plus some characters that 
we will surely meet in the future. 
Overall, an excellent introduc
tion to a group of new characters.
Although Ive never really been 
a fan of black and white books, 
Johnsons art is good enough to 
stand alone without coloring. He 
puts a lot of detail into the pan
els, and they are still clear and 
easy to decipher. Johnsons rep
resentation of Midge is particu
larly enjoyable, especially on the 
Frank Millers SIX Ctiy-like 
splash page.
IMAxyi #U receives the highest 
possible recommendation. Take 
a break from the run of the mill 
super hero, vigilante, and horror 
comics, and give IMAxyi (which 
is really difficult to place in any 
genre) a try. I dont want to bla
tantly advertise, but since 
IMAxyi is probably very hard to 
find around here 4rhynh contact 
me and Ill pass along the info on 
how to support self-publishing 
and get your very own copy of 
IMAxyil You wont regret it. Make 
sure you do it soon, before prices 
for a first print skyrocket, like 
they did for Jeff Smiths TXhl

Orpheus
Jean Cocteau directs this fascinating, Frenchrelated story of the mythical hero Orpheus meet
ing death. The two characters play off of one 
another in a decidedly French ballet of art and 
philosophy. It was also produced in 1949 and 
therefore would have a decidedly French style to it, 
being that it was directed in France.
Starring Jean Mairias and Maria Casares, who 
are coincidentally French, the film is beautifully 
wrought in Cocteaus dreamy, deep style. Like 
many films set in France and other countries 
around France, Orpheus will draw you into its 
mysterious and magical themes.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, October 14
Serial Mom
Kathleen Turner stars in this wacky comedy 
about a loving mother who is also a serial killer. 
Lovingly directed by John Waters (whose name, 
roughly translated into French, would be Jean les 
Eaux), this film deals with the prejudices subur
ban killers face in their everyday lives.
The plot is simple: Turner is a serial killer and 
her suburban neighbors dislike this fact. Comedy 
and zaniness ensue as misdeed after misdeed are 
committed. A wonderful comedic fare e,SerialMom 
is decidedly wonderful and worth a dollar to see. 
Pom Frites!
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, October 15
Mid-Semester Film Fest
The fir st movie of the evening, Ladyhawke, shown 
at 6 pm, is about Ethans mom. No, really: its all 
about Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, and 
Michelle Pfieffer caught in an evil love spell or 
something. Its very fantastical and very similar to 
French food, which also captures me in a love spell. 
I mean, everybody loves French food. And every
body will love Ladyhawke.
The Dark Crystal is like the Muppet Show, only 
the muppets are angry and have big teeth. These 
moaning muppets have to find a dark crystal in 
order to save the world from an evil spell. Featur
ing the mirth and magic of Jim Henson and Frank 
Oz, this film is like a good baguette. It begins at 8 
pm.
The next film, Excalibur, is everybodys dads 
favorite movie. Starring Liam Neesom andPatrick 
Stewert, this film deals with the mirth and magic 
of King Arthurs big bad sword. This film begins 
promptly at 10 pm.
High drama and biting satire come together at 
last in Arnold Schwartzenegers masterwork, 
Conan the Destroyer. On par with Citizen Kane and 
Serial Mom, this movie tells the story of one mans 
journey toward self-discoveiy. It begins at 12:30 
am. Also, an all-night pass for all four movies is 
only a pittance: $2.50. Check it out, cats and 
kittens.

Suspiria
Italian and French are both romantic languages, 
so what better way to off-set a brilliantly done piece 
of French philosophical film with a chiller about an 
Italian ballet school that is actually a witches 
coven? That is exactly what Suspiria has does this 
week in DH 2210.
Produced in 1977 with a soundtrack by the fa
mous rock group Goblin, the plot is fairly silly but 
the mood and camera work is excellent. Starring 
the world-renowned Jessica Harper and directed 
by Dario Argento, the film is rated R for scary 
witches and things like that. See it at midnight for 
that scary, creepy effect.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

By PAUL TABACHNECK
ByMAyX IRhMnITXn ennInAyXA odIATM
Artist: Ben Harper
Album: DhrkTth AT Ach sMHhr DTMrd
Suggested Tracks: Just listen the whole way through.
Imagine a warm Sunday night. 25 musicians or more pack 
themselves and their friends into an otherwise empty 
coffehouse to test out their material. Yes, its the familiar 
ritual of the open stage: four hours of music, divided into one 
hour of genius, two hours of mediocrity, and one hour of 
people that will never again be able to bring themselves to 
show their faces in public.
That one hour of ge
nius, however, is what 
everyone waits for, 
saturated in nicotine 
from the secondhand 
smoke in the air.
Ben Harpers DhrP
kTth AT Ach sMHhr DTMrd 
has just that feeling, as 
he slips and slides his 
way into his listeners 
hearts with guitars, 
combining the racial 
anger of Tracy 
Chapmans debut with 
the sound of the New 
Bohemians (former 
backers of Edie 
Brickell).
Harpers arrange
ments on slide are 
loosely formed, which normally would bother me, but here, for 
some reason, it just adds to the sound that he goes for. The 
rhythm sections are tight and, combined with the guitars, 
form a perfect background for his tangential free-formed 
vocals.
Highlights on the album are many; the bluesy feel of 
Whipping Boy, the traveling charm of Breakin Down, 
Mamas Got A Girlfriend Now (a new spin on lesbianism), 
and the rockin, moving, Like A King are among this hour of 
beautiful soulful tunes. He breathes an air of positivity into 
all 13 songs, ending with the anti-oppressant Ill Rise, in 
which he proclaims his ability to conquer any enemy with his 
endless confidence.
After the album ends, ones index finger cant help but be 
drawn towards the play button, and, unlike other appealing 
indulgences, there is never too much Ben Harper.
DhrkTth AT Ach sMHhr DTMrd is one of the finest debuts I have 
heard in a long time, and I can only hope that this artist 
survives the fabled sophomore slump.
In any case, itll be fun to hear any concoctions he can cook 
up for us in the future, and Ill always listen to him again.
Oh, and let the last track play for a couple of minutes for an 
extra scoop of sugar in your coffee.

Music lacks skill
By JON SLENK
ByMAyX SAyEEfMIAhM$
HTHM fcT xMyRhd Ach !HyXAHt nAMhyt lll They saved our uni
verse ... but the trip changed them forever! Mike Levy (Destructo 
Lad), Sean OSullivan (Danger Boy), Chad Sonenberg . 
(Molasses) and Dave Stem (The Wise Guy).
The packaging for this CD, Bch mryXhA CyXhA by Janet Speaks 
French (JSF), tells the story of a group of musicians who crossed ; 
through dimensional barriers to an alternate universe. There, 
they battled the horrific dictator and evil master-mind, Enrico 
Mandini and his Master Synchronizer, a tool which put into effect I 
his plans for creating order in his private life and everyone elses. |
The heroes of this story, the band and Professor Siddioui, fight | 
the wicked Enrico, eventually destroying his power base and . 
freeing Janet, the leader of the rebellion who had been taken 
captive by Enrico. The album represents the rock and roll that 
Enrico had been attempting to exterminate, which finally proved ; 
to be the weapon of his destruction. Hurray for our team!
Enough ofthe PR crap (... a 10th rate rip-off of Savage Henry!). . 
Down to a review of the music. The first tune, River to My Soul, 
is darned good. I liked its R.E.M./ Tom Petty vocals, the jangly 
guitars, the simple, harmonic, engrossing rhythms, and the 
straight- forward lyrics. I had hope for the rest of the album.
Unfortunately, this hope went unfulfilled. The next track, . 
World on a Wire, is reminiscent of Matthew Sweet. I dont like ' 
Matthew Sweet. However, I must say that Matthew Sweet ren- - 
ders that style somewhat more competently than JSF.
It is here that one begins to sense something isnt quite AchMh $ 
with this band. Is it that the vocals seem weaker? Is it that the : 
lyrics arent really creative enough? (Although we must pay | 
homage to a particular piece of this songs story: Why  why do : 
I want your bad love? /1 never had to work so hard / For so little 
for so long.)
Moving on to Pushed, a somewhat funky tune with Beatles- f 
esque vocals, we find our hopes being further, well,... diminished ; 
(Thefirsttrackyouplayedwasntthisbad...). From there on out, ;; 
the quality of the album stays around this low level. We have a F 
noise tune, a Police-wanna-be tune, an underpowered, unin
spired, unrefined, whiny-vocals-with-good-music tune, a classic : 
rock tune, more funkish stuff, a slow tune, and then the end.
Lest I make it sound like this band totally sucks, let me get into . 
more details about my reaction to this album. The music is good!  
The first song is good! The JSF team has good technical qualities 
to their playing, and they seem to enjoy experimenting with a wide ; 
range of styles. Unfortu
nately, their abilities with 
instruments are not equaled 
in lyrical or vocal qualities.
Basically, the lyrics are 
pretty dumb, and the vocals 
are lacking in skill (they 
seem to have difficulty with 
softer bits).
In conclusion, Id like to 
quote some friends: Ifthese 
songs were played by people 
who could sing, it would be 
pretty good. Thoughtful 
pause, then, in unison, Ex
cept for the lyrics! Should 
JSF put some work into these two areas, I just might become a fan.
 JSF Productions JSF has little potential vocally.
Unwatchable films annoy, bore viewers
Irh UK
by Carey Clevenger
You know, mid-semester break 
is right around the comer. And 
what better way to take a break 
and celebrate than to watch some 
really unwatchable movies  or 
to try to watch them, at any rate.
This is a special diversion from 
my usual column, in that all of 
the films contained in this in
stallment are IRh Ttx Irtnl 
Each of these films has a special 
place in my heart, as they are all 
so incredibly bad that even I cant 
sit through them.
Cover your eyes ... hide under 
the bed... run for your life! Its the 
Attack of the Movies No One 
Can Watch!
TX1A 'T WX Ach OTHnh
Ill mention this one first, be
cause I technically did sit through 
it: it was running on the VCR 
while I looked at my friends video 
guide. But its so incredibly unin
teresting and dull that, had I not 
been so interested in the video 
guide, I would have urged him to 
turn it off.
There isnt too much to say 
about this movie, because I re
member very little about it. I do 
remember two scenes, however: 
one scene in which the antago
nist sets his victim on fire, and 
another where he goes to waste 
some time at the local disco ... 
and what a time waster it is! I 
think hes there for at least fif
teen minutes, in which time there 
is no plot development whatso
ever. This is a good movie to rent 
and watch before something like
C7 or 'cyXdIb because even the 
slow parts in these longer films 
will look much more entertaining 
than the entirety of TX1A 'T WX 
Ach OTHnhl
srynn TE U000
I was very disappointed by this 
film. I remembered seeing the 
commercials for this way back 
when and thinking it looked like 
it would be fairly interesting; and 
Malcolm McDowell (A srTk,fTM, 
vMyXih> plays the school princi
pal. Yet even he cant save this 
trash.
Essentially, it is 1999, and the 
schools across America have be
come a warzone. So, in order to 
cope with violent students, the 
administration of a certain high 
school hires a robotics firm to 
replace all of their teachers with 
androids. (You thought I was go
ing to say Folgers crystals, 
didnt you?)
I remember seeing in the com
mercials that the robo-profs were 
equipped with mini-guns and 
rocket launchers, but I didnt get 
to see any of this cool stuff: I 
couldnt get past the moronic 
scene where one of the teachers 
decides to deal with a scoundrel 
using corporal punishment.
The best part of what I saw was 
Stacy Keach with white hair and 
really bizarre blue-white contacts 
... very odd. If beating up the 
baddies at school sounds inter
esting, MhnIA LhyX TX 2hb and for
get this flick.
DhMhfTrRhn TX Dchhrn
I know what youre thinking: 
how can a movie with a title that 
good be so bad? Well, trust me, it 
is. I was drawn to it by the title 
(which is, admittedly, one of the 
best titles that I have ever seen). 
Its hard to live up to the excite
ment it produces.
The story involves a biker gang, 
the Devils Advocates, who get 
mixed up with these cloaked Sa
tanic priests. The best part about 
this plot development is the dia
logue that they manage to come 
up with, like, The hair of many is 
the hair of One. The priests ba
sically spend a lot of time walk
ing around with big loaves of 
bread and goblets of wine.
I expected too much from this 
movie. I was expecting scenes of 
werewolves riding down the lone
some highway on their hawgs, 
but to no avail: I watched about 
two-thirds of the movie (in two 
sittings: I was a little bit more 
optimistic than I should have 
been), and I only saw a brief shot 
of a werewolf s paw. How disap
pointing! BhhX DTrEcyn more wolf 
action for your entertainment 
dollar, and its slightly more 
watchable.
'IMrEMIhXd EMTt Ohrr
Another great title for another 
bad movie. I found this in the 
comedy section, although I think 
it would have been better placed 
under horror  not that the plot 
is scary, its just horrifying to 
think that this movie was actu
ally made.
The girlfriend in the title is 
throwing a party for all of her 
friends, and its madcap fun when 
shes possessed by a demon! Or, 
at least, its supposed to be mad
cap fun. Nothing that happens is 
even remotely funny. A good way 
to think about this would be to 
say that its |DhIMd SkIhXkh lll 
without all of the sophisticated 
humor.
If you want to see a funny pos
session movie, rent gh4Tnnhnnhdl 
I havent seen all of it either, but 
not because it wasnt entertain
ing: I hadnt seen Bch opTMkInAb so 
I couldnt appreciate all of the 
jokes.
DcIAh IMh
I know ... I mentioned this be
fore. But, its still unwatchable, 
for the same reasons I mentioned 
before.
If you want an entertaining 
Robert Ginty film, get one of the , 
opAhMtIXyATM films. As for dia- j 
mond heist movies, even mTrIkh > 
ekydhta qN ennIiXthXA 2IytI ; 
hykc is more entertaining  ; 
and, it stars CMU alumnus Rene I 
Auberjonois!
How do these movies clock in? j
TXzA 'T IX Ach OTHnh: I sat . 
through all 90 or so minutes of it, 
but recall very little. Sort of like 
the Reagan administration.
srynn TE U000N I saw about 20 , 
minutes of this before I decided 
that it was a complete and utter  
failure.
DhMhfTrRhn TX DchhrnN Prob- | 
ably 45 minutes to an hour. Pub- F 
He television fund drives have A 
held my attention better than | 
this disappointing romp.
'IMrEMIhXd EMTt Ohrr: I saw 
about an hour total. The only real ' 
joke in this movie is that you paid : 
money to rent it.
DcIAh IMh: I saw about 20-30 
minutes of it. This movie may 
cure insomnia.
Well, that should be enough 
trash to sort through over the 
break. Just keep in mind: I 
warned you! This stuff is really 
bad.
Next week: Nothing! Because 
of mid-semester break, I will be 
back in two weeks, because ... 
(ominous music)... Even if Acha 
try to stop me, you must know 
the truth! (Note: This plot de
vice is called FORESHADOW
