unar bakery...Taiwan gets help from CMU
By LAINE TOWEY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
From June 1 until September 24 of 
this year, Carnegie Mellon Police have 
reported a total of 32 bicycles stolen. 
According to Campus Police, this is a 
substantial rise from last year.
The bikes were stolen despite the fact 
that every single bike was secured by a 
cable lock.
Ronald Pudlowski, an officer assigned 
to the Crime Prevention Unit at CMU, 
said that the cost of the bikes stolen 
ranged from $200 to $6000.
The data available for the month of 
August 1998, when 16bikes were stolen, 
is a good indicator that bike thefts occur 
all over campus. A total of six thefts 
occurred at the Morewood Gardens bike 
rack, while Hamburg Hall and 
Hamerschlag Hall bike racks were the
sites of two thefts apiece. Other theft 
locations include the Hunt Library, the 
University Center, and Donner Hall.
According to Sergeant Richard Sima of 
CMU police, a total of three arrests have 
been made since the end of August. About 
a month ago, two adults were arrested 
after being chased down Fifth Avenue. On 
September 9, police arrested a juvenile 
who had a stolen bike which was recov
ered and returned this week to the proper 
owner. All three were charged with re
ceiving stolen property, theft, and crimi
nal trespass. One of the adults was also 
charged with posessing instruments of 
crime. All cases are still pending.
Sima also said that to his knowledge the 
incidents are not directly related. Accord
ing to Pittsburgh Police, he said that the 
thieves sell the bikes for quick drug money, 
$50-$100 for each bike.

Job fairs draw record-number crowd

Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, you might 
have noticed a student sit
ting behind you in class play
ing with a Rubiks Cube, sev
eral key chains, colorful pens, 
miniature globes, and 
squeeze toys. He was prob
ably wearing a suit but had 
more than one new t-shirt in 
his briefcase, and he prob
ably had gotten his new toys 
from the Technical Opportu
nities Conference (TOC).
The TOC and Business Op
portunities Conference (BOC) 
were held in the University 
Center last Thursday and Fri
day and hosted a record num
ber of employers. Visiting em
ployers handed out bro
chures, application forms, 
company updates, annual re
ports, and toys printed with 
. company names.
The TOC was an amazing 
success this year, said Toby 
H. Goldstein, a senior com
puter science major, the 1999 
TOC chairperson, and a mem
ber of Society of Women Engi
neers (SWE). We had more 
companies than ever before. 
For the first time we had booths 
in the Peter Wright-McKenna 
room and the UC Lobby as 
well as our usual locations in 
the UC Gym and Rangos Hall, 
and we still had companies on 
the waiting list to attend.
The TOC played host to 189 
visiting employers while the 
BOChosted48. Attending com
panies included: AT&T, 
Warburg Dillon Read, Radi
ant Systems, Razorfish, IBM, 
Lutron, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Amazon.com, and Proc
tor & Gamble.
Since 1994 we have had a 
good, long-standing relationship 
with CMU. We interview seniors 
and graduate students for full
time jobs and we also take sopho
mores and juniors for intern
ships. We offer jobs in manufac
turing, engineering, product de
velopment, purchasing, informa
tion technology, corporate 
prototyping, and package devel
opment, said a representative 
from Proctor and Gamble.
Many representatives for the 
TOC flew into Pittsburgh on 
Wednesday and arrived on cam
pus at 10 am on Thursday to set 
up their booths. Many were re
cent university graduates; some
were CMU alumni.
Representatives from CMUs 
Career Center, as well as repre
sentatives from CollegeHire.com, 
which handles recruiting for over 
50 companies, were present to 
help students with general questions about employment. 
CollegeHire.com also held an 
information session last 
Thursday night.
Many companies begin recruit
ing new employees for perma
nent positions in the fall.
Because it is only the first step 
in a longer path of career plan
ning, it is important that the TOC 
be early in the year. Many stu
dents arrange more formal inter
views after connecting with com
panies at the TOC [and] continue
their job searches from there. 
said Goldstein.
Organizing the TOC is a yearround event. In the fall, Masha 
Kovarsky, a senior in computer 
science who is in charge of Exter
nal Affairs in SWE, said that she 
spent about 2 to 5 hours per day 
on organizing the event.
I think its one of the best op
portunities during the year for 
CMU students to learn about the 
different companies and jobs, and 
for recruiters to get to know and 
attract CMU students. Some stu
dents have no idea where to start 
looking for a job, especially sopho
mores and juniors looking for in
ternships, and the TOC gives them 
a great start, said Kovarsky.

Last Tuesday an earthquake ranging 
7.6 on the Richter scale hit Taiwan kill
ing 2,056 individuals and injuring 8,667 
as of last Sunday. Rescue teams from 
Taiwan, the tlnited States, and other 
countries are on their last-ditch efforts 
to recover the nearly 1,400 people listed 
either missing or stranded and to help 
repair the billions of dollars in damage 
the initial quake caused along with the 
continuing aftershocks. More locally, stu
dents at CMU are raising awareness 
and dollars to donate to Taiwan in order 
to help the Taiwanese citizens.
In a short amount of time the Taiwan 
Relief Fund, a group of approximately 
30 to 40 individuals, started thinking 
about ways to help Taiwan during this
crisis. Tom Chang, a senior industrial 
management major, is one of the people 
who started confering with leaders of 
student organizations about what could 
be done to help.
At the same time I started contacting 
people [in student organizations.] two or 
three other people were also starting to 
talk to other people, said Chang [The 
group] is not a coalition of student orga
nizations, it is the entire campus com
munity getting involved.
Many of the organization heads and 
leaders from the Awareness of Roots of 
Chinese Culture (ARCC), Taiwanese 
Student Association (TSA), and TzuChi, a national organization founded 
by Buddhists, have been heavily in
volved in creating an organized system 
to inform as many individuals on cam
pus about the issue as possible. Last
Friday was the first night of a two-week 
span in which tables will be set up in 
areas around campus to elicit funds 
and distribute information about the 
earthquake. At the Mid-Autumn Festi
val last Saturday night sponsored by 
ARCC and Singapore Students Asso
ciation (SSA), the Taiwan Relief Effort 
was allowed to set up a table and an
nounce the groups intent. Over $1,000 
was collected in the two nights tables 
have been set up. All this week tables 
will be located outside Doherty, the 
University Center, and GSIA.
All money raised will be donated to 
Taiwan through Tzu-Chi. Other benefit 
groups such as the Red Cross and the 
Rotary Club were looked at as potential 
go-betweens, but Tzu-Chi was the most 
direct of the researched selections, acPlease see RELIEF, page 3

Financial aid could be 
hurt by education bill
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (U-WIRE)/ 
Michigan Daily  Federal funding of 
student financial aid could take a $99- 
million hit in the next fiscal year under 
the higher education appropriations 
bill repotted out of a House of Repre
sentatives subcommittee Thursday.
If the bill was implemented as cur
rently written, said a spokesperson 
for committee member U.S. Rep. 
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a 6 percent 
drop in federal work-study funding 
would mean 62,000 fewer students 
could participate in the program dur
ing the 2000-01 academic year.
The bill also gives colleges and uni
versities $140 million less than Con
gress allocated to higher education 
this year, making significant cuts to 
many school-run programs while to
tally eliminating funding for others.
While cutting $2.37 billion in funding 
for Pell Grants from the current year, 
the bill adds $150 to the maximum 
allowable grant amount. The Pell Grant 
program is the largest federally funded 
grant program for individual students.
The committee and the chairman 
place the Pell Grants at the very highest 
priority, a subcommittee spokesperson 
said. We dont have a lot of money.
Eight months after the Clinton ad
ministration made its fiscal year 2000 
budget recommendation in January, 
the Republican-led 15-member sub
committee on Labor, Health and Hu
man Services, and Education sent the 
bill to the full appropriations commit
tee, which could take it up next week.
October 1 marks the end of the cur
rent fiscal year, when the new budget 
should theoretically take effect.
Tom Butts, associate vice president 
for University of Michigan relations, 
said Congress will file a continuing 
motion extending the time it has to
finalize the budget bills. It could be 
two to three more months before the 
higher education bill passes both 
houses and is signed into law, he said.
Butts, who lobbies in Washington, 
D.C. on behalf of the university, said 
the process is still in such a prelimi
nary stage that its unknown exactly 
how the dollar amounts could affect 
the university.
The numbers look pretty much like 
a freeze, Butts said. Theyre sub
stantially lower than the higher edu
cation groups have been advocating. 
But, he added, universities are ex
pected to fare slightly better by the 
time a finalized bill is implemented.
What chairman John Porter [R-Ill] 
was trying to do was get something out 
of the committee, Butts said. I dont 
think anyone thinks this is what the 
final product will look like.
Because all 12 other appropriations 
subcommittees have already sent their 
bills to the full committee, significant 
amounts of money initially designated 
for educationhave already been claimed 
for other departments. To make up for 
that deficit, the .bill pulls more than $14 
million in advance funding from fiscal 
year 2001 appropriation funding for 
the Department of Education.
Everyone knew beforehand that the 
Republicans would make a budget gim
mick, saidPelosis spokesperson. The 
hole was so big that the only way to fill 
the hole was to-borrow from next year 
or to come up with gimmicks.
By talcing such a large amount from 
the following year, universities wont 
be able to plan ahead as easily, he said, 
explaining that there will be more un
certainty in what level of appropria
tions will be available in future years.
They may not be able to act properly 
on decisions that are crucial, he said.
New jail poses as 
Kentucky farm
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP)  Ordered by 
a judge to relieve inmate crowding, the 
city and county had to face up to their 
need for a new jail.
But amid the rolling bluegrass smack in 
the heart ofKentuckys genteel horse coun
try, not just any jail would do. The solu
tion? Disguise the lockup as a horse farm.
As former Vice Mayor Teresa Isaac 
joked when the $71 million project was 
shown to the citys governing council 
last year, It will be the first jail in 
Southern Living. 
The Fayette County Detention Cen
ter, due to open in May, will house 1,200 
inmates in a building that incorporates 
leading-edge corrections design: video 
conferencing capabilities, a jail within 
a jail assessment center, and modular 
living areas where one guard can super
vise as many as 40 inmates.
None of that will be visible to travelers 
on the scenic Old Frankfort Pike, lead
ing to some of the worlds most famous 
thoroughbred horse farms. Queen Eliza
beth II has bought and boarded horses 
in the Lexington area.
Farms include Three Chimneys, home 
of 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle 
Slew and 1997 Kentucky Derby and 
Preakness winner Silver Charm.
Passers-by wall see only a landscaped 
hill, topped by an administration build
ing designed to look like the main house 
at a horse farm, with brick facing and a 
turreted cupola in the center of the roof.
A low stone wall extends to either side 
of the main building, adding to the ap
pearance. The jail itself is behind the 
hill, laid out in a fan shape below the 
main building.
We said from the beginning, This is 
going to be an asset,  said a Fayette 
County jailer, Ray Sabbatine, who helped 
design it.
Not everyone is so appreciative.
Coming from an architects perspec
tive, things should look like what they 
are, said Allen Swerdlowe, an architect
who teaches at the Pratt Institute in 
New York.
You want a stadium to look like a 
stadium, not a shopping mall.... Once 
you start to mix languages, when a 
buildings form defies its function, the 
character of a building starts to defy 
its environment.
Less bothered by the jails facade is 
Constantine Karalis, who also teaches 
at Pratt and runs a private architec
tural practice that designs jails and 
other in situations.
If a jail is an unpleasant thought and 
sight to people, and you make it look like 
a horse farm, then it is a dishonest thing 
to do, but I would call it a misdemeanor, 
because eventually people will know its 
a jail anyway, he said.
Dust storm kills, 
injures drivers
PENDLETON, Ore. (AP)  Vehicle 
pileups caused by a blinding dust storm 
killed at least six people and injured at 
least a dozen just west of this northeast
ern Oregon city on Saturday, closing 
Interstate 84 in both directions.
At least 50 vehicles were involved in 
one pileup in the eastbound lanes, said 
Lt. Gregg Hastings, an Oregon State 
Police spokesman.
The Oregon Department of Transpor
tation said two crashes in the west
bound lane, each involving semi trucks 
and passenger vehicles, each killed one 
person.
At the same location in the eastbound 
lane a crash involving five semi trucks 
and 11 vehicles claimed four lives.
The accidents in the wheat and sage
brush country 175 miles east of Port
land happened late Saturday morning.
Crews from ODOT blocked the free
way at Stanfield and Pendleton and 
rerouted traffic through Walla 
Walla, Washington.
Nine people were sent to Good Shep
herd Hospital in Hermiston, with two 
admitted, while another three were be
ing treated at St. Marys Hospital in 
Walla Walla, officials said.
Searchers find 
tourist airplane
KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP)  The 
wreckage of a sightseeing airplane miss
ing overnight with 10 people on board 
was spotted Sunday on a nearly inacces
sible spot on Mauna Loa Volcano.
Searchers flying over the area found 
the debris at an elevation of about 10,000- 
feet on the mountainside, said Marilyn 
Kali, a spokeswoman for the state De
partment of Transportation.
They did not see any immediate indi
cation whether there were any survi
vors, she said.
Rescuers were attempting to reach 
the spot by helicopter.
Big Island Air notified Kona Interna
tional Airport at 7:20 pm Sunday that 
its twin-engine Cessna was overdue with 
a pilot and nine passengers.
The plane had taken off from the air
port at 4:30 pm for a tour of the islands 
inactive volcanoes, Mauna Loa and 
Mauna Kea.
Bomb goes off 
in Sri Lanka bus
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP)Abomb 
went off in a bus in central Sri Lanka 
Sunday killing one person and wound
ing 28 others, police said.
The explosion took place just outside 
Badulla, a town 140 miles east of the 
capital, Colombo, police said.
Police said no suspects have been iden
tified, but authorities increased the num
ber of road checkpoints in and around 
the town. No one immediately claimed 
responsibility for the blast.
Most of the wounded had burn inju
ries but were in stable condition, said 
Dr. Kanesapillai Raj at ..the Badulla 
Hospital. Three people suffered serious 
injuries, he said.
The explosion came four days after 
two similar blasts in buses in the tourist 
resort town of Negombo. Ten people were 
injured in those blasts.
World leaders sit down to discuss health of global economy
WASHINGTON (AP)  The United 
States and its wealthy allies told Rus
sian authorities on Saturday there 
was a critical need for that 
country to attack corruption and 
money laundering.
Financial leaders from the worlds 
seven largest industrial countries saw 
encouraging signs that the global 
;economy was beginning to stabilize 
after nearly two years of severe finan
cial turmoil, although there was dis
cussion among the group about the 
threats posed from a potentially over
heated U.S. economy.
In an 11-page joint statement, the 
finance ministers and central bank presi
dents of the Group of Seven countries 
noted that Japanese authorities had 
given assurances that they intended to 
supply necessary government stimulus 
until domestic-demand-led growth is 
solidly in place.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Sum
mers, briefing reporters after the talks 
concluded, stressed that language is key
to understanding the G-7 position.
Japan was a key focus of discussion, 
Summers said. The United States has 
been stressing the need for Japan not to 
relent in its efforts to lift its economy 
from its worst recession in 50 years.
The communique was issued at the 
end of more than five hours of discus
sions among financial leaders of the 
worlds biggest economies  the United 
States, Japan, Germany, France, Brit
ain, Italy, and Canada.
Russian Finance Minister Mikhail 
Kasyanov met with the group at the end 
of their afternoon discussions in an his
toric mansion near the White House in 
an effort to answer questions that have 
been raised in the wake of the money 
laundering probes.
We are committed to cooperate with 
any investigation, Kasyanov told re
porters after emerging from the meet
ing. He said that Russia had already 
begun taking measures to control 
capital flight from the country, a 
term that covers both the
legal transfer of money and 
illegal transfers.
The communique said prospects looked 
good for both the United States and 
Canada to continue with another year 
of solid growth and job creation in a lowinflation environment.
But German Finance Minister Hans 
Eichel told reporters that the finance 
officials had discussed worries that the 
U.S. economy could overheat, with 
growth so strong that it may ignite infla
tion pressures.
Eichel said that Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who also 
participated in the discussions, made it 
clear that he is monitoring the situa
tion. The Fed has already raised inter
est rates twice since June 30 and some 
economists believe a third rate hike may 
occur at the Feds next meeting on 
October 5.
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa told reporters he had assured 
Summers and Greenspan that the 
Japanese government is committed to
continuing efforts to boost 
government spending as needed 
to make sure that Japans efforts 
to emerge from the worst do 
not falter.
The G-7 communique did not include 
the language Japan had wanted on keep
ing the yen from strengthening further 
against the dollar. Instead, the group 
merely pledged to monitor develop
ments in exchange markets and cooper
ate as appropriate.
But Italian Finance Minister Giuliano 
Amato said the G-7 officials had not 
ruled out the possibility of joint inter
vention in currency markets at some 
point in the future. He said such action 
would be taken when and how it is 
deemed appropriate.
The G-7 discussions were being held 
in advance of the annual meetings of 
the 182-nation International 
Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank,sessions that are expected 
to be focused on ways to promote 
further reforms in the world
financial system to prevent, 
or at least better manage:
future Asian-style currency crises.
In that regard, the G-7 said they had 
set up a new group of 20 nations, includ
ing both wealthy and poor countries, 
who will hold their first meeting 
in Berlin in December with 
Canadian finance minister Paul Martin 
as chairman.
The Group of 20, which was strongly 
pushed by the United States, is seen 
by the administration as a way to 
include relevant policy-makers in 
brainstorming sessions to come up 
with more far-reaching financial re 
form proposals.
The G-7 officials indicated that the 
upcoming IMF and World Bank meet
ings would produce a comprehensive 
strategy to greatly expand the 
amount of debt relief provided for the 
worlds poorest nations, something 
that officials have been trying 
to implement for more than 
two years.

50 YEARS AGO, September 
27, 1949  The Council of Fra
ternity Presidents announced 
plans to change several rules for 
involved fraternities.The new 
rules aimed to increase atten
dance at meetings and the saftey 
of events. Under the new rulings, 
each fraternity president, along 
with one junior member from each 
fraternity, must attend all meet
ings or incurs a $5.00 fine. Along 
with the meeting rules, a booklet 
was made and distributed to all 
first-year students describing 
rushing rules. The Council also 
announced that rules governing 
the annual Greek Sing and Swing 
competion would be revised.
25 YEARS AGO, October 2, 
1974  Carnegie Mellon and 
Penn-DOT came to terms on the 
widening of Forbes Avenue. The
going rate of property at the time 
was $5-7 a square foot, but CMU 
agreed to donate 20,000 square 
feet of land in exchange for spe
cific features that would be added 
by Penn-DOT. Those features in
cluded the special pull-off areas 
for buses and wheelchair ramps 
near Warner Hall and Beeler 
Street, along with bus shelters 
provided by PAT for student 
safety. Penn-DOT also agreed to 
pay for the re-landscaping of 
CMUs property near the construc
tion. CMU hired private landscap
ing architects for the job.
10 YEARS AGO, September 
26,1989  Campus Police began 
subscribing to a satellite television 
service that provided police train
ing and instruction programming. 
Campus Police were the third po
lice organization in the state to
subscribe to the service, and the 
first University police force. The 
service, which Campus Police 
learned about in a police maga
zine, covered topics such as life 
saving techniques, legal updates, 
and public relations. Supervisors 
who watched programs regularly 
could then be tested on the mate
rial, and eventually earn an asso
ciates degree through the program.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Septem
ber 26, 1994Plans were made to 
re-open Scotland Yard, a coffee 
house originally located in the old 
Skibo Student Center. The coffee 
house was closed because of the 
demolition of Skibo to make room 
for the University Center. The 
Morewood basement was chosen 
by StudentBodyPresidentDeclan 
McCullagh as the best place to re
open the coffee house. A preliminary survey was conducted and, in 
it, no one wanted to have the coffee 
house close as early as midnight. 
More than half said they wanted it 
to close at 2 am, and the rest said 
between 3 and 4 am.
ONE YEAR AGO, September 
28, 1998  The National Science 
Foundation awarded a $12.9 mil
lion five-year renewable grant to 
the Medical Robotics and Com
puter Assisted Surgery Depart
ment of CMU, Johns Hopkins, and 
MIT. The grants formed an Engi
neering Research Center for Com
puter-Integrated Surgical Systems 
and Technology to be shared by the 
three schools. It also provided for 
one student fellowship.

9/22 ARREST, 8:40 pm  A 
security guard in the UC noti
fied CMU police about a theft in 
progress in the UC mens locker 
room. The theft was reported by 
a CMU. alum. The alum wit
nessed a male wearing black 
baggy pants and a black hooded 
t-shirt attempting to remove a 
combination lock from a locker 
with a pair of red bolt cutters. 
The alum said the actor took off 
running from the locker room 
and also dropped a black back
pack. The backpack contained a 
pair of 14-inch bolt cutters and 
silver combination locks.
Another officer observed a 
male matching the description 
of the suspect walking rapidly 
along Frew Street. The officer 
detained the suspect and 
searched his car. After finding 
several more locks in the car, 
the officer arrested the actor, 
who was later turned over to 
city police.
9/23 THEFT, 9:37 am  A 
CMU officer was dispatched to
Wean Hall for a burglary re
port. He spoke with the victim, 
a food vendor manager. The vic
tim told the officer that she had 
been experiencing thefts from 
her establishment's storage 
space. The thefts consisted of a 
bottle of soda or a muffin, and 
the victim felt it would have 
been a waste of time to report 
the petty thefts.
However, approximately one 
week ago unknown person(s) re
moved four cases of Coke from 
the storage room. The manager, 
along with a colleague, left a note 
for the thieves to stop their bur
glaries. However shortly after 
leaving the note unknown 
person(s) entered the storage fa
cility and threw two cases of glassbottled iced tea onto the ground, 
breaking four bottles. The man
ager notified CPS for the cleanup. 
The victim was. advised to call 
Campus Police if she experienced 
further thefts.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University27 September 1999Beaux Arts group 
dropped the ball
The Beaux Arts Ball, a biennial 
dinner and dance event, has been a 
Carnegie Mellon tradition since the 
early 1900s. However, the event 
has not taken place since the spring 
of 1995. To save the Ball from ex
tinction, a committee was formed 
last spring. Unfortunately, this 
committee has disbanded, once 
again endangering the existence of 
this part of CMU history.
In the past, CFA sponsored the 
Beaux Arts Ball every other year, 
inviting students from all colleges 
to enjoy a night of feasting and 
dancing. The Ball was a chance for 
Fine Arts majors to bring other 
students into their world for one 
night. The event was held in the 
CFA building, where masses of 
elaborately costumed students 
danced until morning.
In hopes of continuing the Ball, 
student committees have repeat
edly formed and disintegrated, 
mostly due to poor planning or lack 
of interest or commitment. With 
the most recent committee failing 
for these reasons  the third such 
failure since 1997  the Beaux 
Arts Ball seems to be doomed.
Allowing this event to fade away 
will only hurt the campus commu
nity. In its prime, the Ball was a 
major event in the fall semester 
that students looked forward to, 
much as they look forward to Car
nival in the spring. There are no 
regularly scheduled, campus-wide 
formal dances at CMU anymore, 
and students would welcome the 
return of this popular one. If action 
is not started now to save the Beaux 
Arts Ball, it will fade away and be 
forgotten. No current student at 
Carnegie Mellon has ever seen a 
Beaux Arts Ball, and to let another 
year pass could destine the event 
for permanent cancellation.
In order to save this event, the 
committee formed last semester 
must come back to life. Its mem
bers should talk to CMU alumni 
who have experienced past Beaux 
Arts Balls. Funding needs to be 
approved, and students who know 
of the event from previous upper
classmen must be found to con
tinue the spirit of the event.
Carnegie Mellon must have its 
Beaux Arts Ball back this year, or 
it may never happen again. Inter
ested students, especially the pre
vious committee members, need to 
take charge to prevent this unique 
tradition from dying.Budget surplus must 
be reinvested
Lawmakers must be cautious in 
spending the projected $800 bil
lion national budget surplus. Only 
a program of moderate, pointed tax 
relief, combined with an effort to 
pay down the national debt and 
strengthen federal services, will 
take proper advantage of it.
The battle over the surplus offi
cially began in August when Con
gress passed a budget bill that in
cluded across-the-board income tax 
cuts. Hie bill would have also gradu
ally eliminated estate taxes, re
duced capital gains taxes, eased 
the marriage penalty (which taxes 
married couples more than single 
people), and reduced business 
taxes. Last week, the White House 
vetoed the bill.
The suggested tax cuts are a bad 
idea for several reasons .First, they 
are too much in favor of upper-class 
spending. The wealthy stand to 
gain a lot more from cutting capital 
gains, inheritance, and estate taxes 
than any other tax bracket. Lower 
and middle income groups stood to 
benefit only marginally from the 
across-the-board income tax drop 
and the marriage penalty. Some 
estimates put the average savings
of a lower- to middle-income family 
around $100 per year, while fami
lies in the top 1.8% could save over 
$9,000.
Also, the economy is not guaran
teed to keep going at its current 
growth rate. If the economy slows 
down and tax revenues decrease, 
the federal government may see 
itself in a budget deficit again, and 
cutting taxes now will force the 
government to dip into Social Secu
rity money.
The surplus should be used to 
strengthen critical federal pro
grams and put the nation on strong 
financial footing. If the government 
concentrates on paying off our $5.6- 
trillion national debt, experts pre
dict that we could lower our annual 
interest payments by $159 billion 
peryearby2009. This money would 
then be free for Social Security, 
health care, and education.
The overall economy would be 
served best by cutting taxes for 
middle and lower income families 
and reinvesting the remaining sur
plus. It is critical that we take ad
vantage of the good economic for
tune of the 90s and reinvest the 
surplus, not liquidate it.
Editorial dissent
When President Clinton vetoed 
the Republican tax cut, he decided 
for you to let the government keep 
your money. In vetoing this bill, he 
perpetuated an ever-expanding, inefficient government. Clinton 
claims he intends to use the budget 
surplus to shore up Social Security 
and deplete our national debt, while 
arguing that the tax cut would have 
benefited only the rich. '
In truth, Social Security is finan
cially secure. The problem lies in 
the governments propensity to take 
from Social Security funds to ex
pand or create unnecessary pro
grams. If the Clinton administra
tion would cease to bloat the gov
ernment, there would be no need 
for this borrowing, thus eliminat
ing the need to save Social Secu
rity. The left wing likes to brand 
the GOP plan as negligent of our 
national debt. However, the vetoed 
tax cut would have devoted $2.2 
trillion to paying down the debt.
The Clinton administration has 
introduced the idea that the gov
ernment should serve as a nanny, 
coddling us and suggesting we are 
incapable of making decisions for 
ourselves as to how our money is 
best spent.

LaRita Y. Hamilton
Every Thursday night, I wonder: If 
the people on Friends live in New York 
City, why dont they know any black 
people? I find it difficult to believe that a 
group of twenty somethings living in New 
York City never run across any AfricanAmerican  or Hispanic, for _______
that matter  people. Im not 
the only one who has noticed.
The NAACP and the National 
Council of La Raza have 
brought the matter to the at
tention of the major networks.
The organizations have en
couraged members of their 
communities to participate in 
Brownouts, boycotts of tele
vision programs that do not include mi
norities as principal or secondary char
acters. Why should they support pro
gramming that does not represent or 
recognize their communities? The Big 
Four (NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox) are 
under pressure to start representing 
minority groups to a greater degree.
Many of the new shows that are being 
distributed by the major networks 
have almost no ethnic characters in 
primary or secondary roles. Return
ing shows, while better, are still show
ing low percentages of minority 
characters. In terms of African-American characters, the average representa
tion in the Big Four was 14 percent. 
CBS led the pack with 18 percent, fol
lowed by ABC with 14 percent.
The two networks with the highest 
percentage of black characters are UPN, 
with 46 percent and WB, with 23 per
cent. These small networks have gone 
out of their way to produce shows that 
cater to minorities, especially AfricanAmericans. Never mind the fact that 
many of the shows are comedies whose 
characters border on buffoonery.
Minor networks can afford to program 
those types of shows because they pro
vide a consumer group that is unique. 
Chances are, you will see more commerI find it difficult to believe that a

the WB than you would see on NBC 
during the same time.
Numbers for the representation of 
Hispanics are even worse. Though the 
Hispanic community makes up about 
11 percent of the population, only two 
percent of the principal roles on major 
networks are Hispanic. Amidst the 
Brownout, NBC had to scramble to 
correct itself when a line from its hit 
show Will and Grace was deemed in
appropriate. One of the Caucasian 
characters referred to her Salvadorian 
maid as a tamale. NBC brass had the 
comment changed to honey immedi
ately, but the incident has made it
apparent that networks are not taking 
minorities into consideration when 
making important decisions in pro
gramming. I doubt that comment would 
have been made if there were a His
panic character on the cast in a role 
other than as a maid.
I suppose that in order to end the 
Brownout with a bang, ABC aired 
Selena, the story of a Tejano music star 
whose career ended abruptly when 
she was murdered by a member of her 
own fan club, on September 5. Nice 
try. Whats next, Alex Haleys Roots?
________ For two weeks, the NAACPs
and NCLRs Brownouts 
have been put into place 
in an effort to affect ratings. 
The first two weeks of the 
new season are extremely 
important. They help net
works set advertising 
rates and undoubtably are 
taken into consideration 
when planning for mid-sea
son shows.
The Brownout was successful. Net
works are re-evaluating their program
ming. They have realized that you 
cannot take two groups who make 
up approximately 22.8 percent of the 
entire population for granted. Hope
fully, mid-season changes in 
programming will reflect a new 
awareness and commitment to 
promote diversity.

Gun laws endanger law-abiding citizens
Frank J. Fleming
Inevitably, anytime a tragedy occurs, 
someone will suggest that the solution is 
that people should have less freedom. In 
the old days, the offending person was 
beaten to death by God-fearing Ameri
cans, but nowadays, such people are 
elected to Congress.
Im sure youre aware of the many 
headline-provoking shootings that have 
started occurring in the j>ast couple of 
years with increasing frequency. Many 
people blame the problems on guns, with 
their proposed solution being to get rid 
of these guns. But  and correct me if 
Im wrong  I believe that guns were 
invented at least 10 or more years ago, so 
there aint exactly a clear-cut cause and 
effect here.
So why do guns get the blame? Well, 
some would say its because guns kill 
people. Thats true. Guns do kill people; 
its what many of them are for. If I 
bought a handgun, and, perchance, found 
it was bad at killing people, I would 
return it to the store and say, This gun 
is not killing people. Please give me a 
full refund or an exchange for a gun 
more adept at the killing of man. You 
see, the problem aint that guns kill 
people, its that they aint killing the 
right people. The only people getting 
killed are innocent people, not criminals, because 
criminals are 
the only ones 
who can 
carry guns.
Places like 
Washington,
D.C. have 
passed laws 
saying that 
no one, not 
even the 
most honest, 
law-abiding 
citizen, can 
own a hand
gun. For 
some reason, 
lawmakers 
thought that 
this would 
stop crimi
nals from us
ing hand
guns, and it 
did, for about 
five seconds, 
which was 
the time it
took for one of the criminals to realize, 
Hey, were criminals. We dont obey 
laws. So this handgun law does not af
fect us. To which another criminal re
sponded, And, as an added bonus, hon
est, law-abiding citizens, a.k.a., our vic
tims, do obey laws. This means we can' 
be absolutely certain that theyre un
armed, thus allowing us to rob, rape, 
and murder with impunity. I told you
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Editor
voting Democratic would pay off. For. 
you see  and I cant stress this enough 
criminals break laws. Thats why more 
laws dont keep criminals from getting 
guns, because they just break those laws. 
Thus, new laws would not have stopped 
any of these tragedies.

Ohio decision decreases Hispanics civil rights
Chris May
U.S. District Court Judge 
James Carr has ruled that state 
troopers may question motorists 
about their immigration status 
when theyre pulled over for rou
tine traffic stops. This ruling was 
based on a case in which two 
Hispanics were pulled over by 
Ohio State Troopers. The trooper 
asked the driver to sit in the 
back seat of the police car while 
he checked his drivers license. 
The officer then demanded to 
see the motorists green cards. 
One of the police officers asked if 
they had paid for the cards, and 
the motorists replied that they 
had. The officers then seized the 
green cards, because the cards 
were not supposed to be avail
able for purchase  he thought 
they had gotten the cards ille
gally. The motorists later claimed 
that they did not understand 
exactly wKat the officer was ask
ing, since they do not speak En
glish. very well. They thought 
the officer was asking if they had
paid the proper fees for the green 
cards. The green cards were re
turned to the motorists four days 
later. Judge Carrs ruling was 
that troopers can question mo
torists about anything as long as 
it does not take longer than a 
routine traffic stop would. How
ever, Judge Carr allowed the men 
to sue because their green cards 
were kept for an unreasonable 
length of time.
The officers actions are clearly 
an example of harassment. To 
seat a motorist in the back of a 
police car is usually a sign that 
the police are trying to intimi
date that person. Amendment
IV to the United States Consti
tution reads The rights of per
sons to be secure in their per
sons, houses, papers, and effects 
shall not be violated, and no 
warrants shall issue, but upon 
probable cause, supported by 
oath or affirmation, and par
ticularly describing the place to 
be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized; Amendment
V reads ...nor be deprived of 
life, liberty, or property, with
out due process of law. In short, 
giving the police the right to 
seize property without any sort 
of warrant is unconstitutional.
It has been established in the
Supreme Court of the 
United States that 
there are only four 
exceptions to the 
search-and-seizure 
rules. Police may 
search areas and seize 
property to assure 
their own safety, 
in a stop-and-frisk 
procedure, during a 
lawful arrest, or with 
consent. The traffic 
stop described did not 
give any of those rea
sons for seizure. Un
less the officers are 
going to claim that the 
motorists race pro
vided reasonable 
cause for the seizure, 
they are violating the 
Fourth Amendment.
Of course, they might 
say that the seizure 
was justified by the 
motorists admission of 
having paid for the 
green cards. However, 
that doesnt make sense. 
If the men had purchased the 
cards illegally, why would they 
admit that to the police? 
This seems like a case of 
officers abusing the language 
barrier as well as using
Sam Lind/Tartan I
intimidation to force admissions 
of guilt.
Traffic stops are intended 
to punish those whose cars 
or driving make the road 
unsafe. The objective of traffic 
stops should not be to harass to his column,
individuals until some 
sort of guilt can be iden
tified. Judge Carr has 
now given Ohio State 
Troopers the power 
to interrogate anyone, 
as long as they do it 
quickly. He has also jus
tified the seizure of pri
vate property based 
on the opinion of one in
dividual.
America is not a police 
state, in which the ac
tions of individuals are 
in constant question. 
How could this decision 
do anything but encour
age the harassment 
of Hispanics? Why 
should Hispanics endure 
another attack? Havent 
we learned anything 
since the Irish and Ital
ian immigration waves? 
Is convicting the possess
ors of a few illegal green 
cards really worth sacri
ficing another little piece 
rights?

New citizen discovers ugly racial politics of citizenship
Lin Lynn Tao
Last week, I went back to Texas and 
swore in as a citizen of this great nation. 
This week, I got a phone call from my 
parents and learned about the benefits of 
being an American.
My eight-year-old sister, Mary, was 
beaten up in school. Three African-Ameri
can boys ganged up on her and started 
punching her. When Tasked my parents 
how badly she got hurt, they merely dodged 
the question and didnt tell me. I talked to
my sister and she started crying. Lynn, I 
tried to punch back, but they beat up this 
Korean girl too.
This is the small town of Greenville, 
Mississippi, population approximately 
40,000, to which my parents moved re
cently. Sixty percent of the people are black 
and most of the remaining residents are 
white  except for a handful of Asian 
residents. I was alarmed when Mary started 
telling me about school  instead of telling 
me how much she hates spelling or math, 
she told me the racial status of her teach
ers. I told her I dont care, and asked her to 
not tell me what race her teachers are 
anymore, because it doesnt matter. I tried 
to teach her all the politically correct stuff,
hoping that if she learns all the right 
things, she wouldnt be foolish and make 
a slip about black people. People do it all 
the time in Mississippi, but something 
tells me that when an eight-year-old 
Chinese girl does it, the consequences 
are different. I was hoping that if I could 
ignore racism, racism would be kind 
enough to do the same to me. But appar
ently, it is something one cannot ignore.
The question that is racing through 
my head right now is Why? I was 
taught that if you dont provoke others, 
others would leave you alone. I spent 
my early days in America reading and 
drawing pictures, ignoring the mockery 
from my fellow classmates when they
called me Chung Li, and made noises 
that they thought resembled my native 
tongue. When they rudely called across 
the room, Hey, Chinese girl, why your 
eyes look funny? I simply pretended that 
I didnt hear. The wealthy white people 
didnt want to have anything to do with me 
and the blacks made fun of me. So, against 
my parents will, I hung out with the 
white trash of the schoolthey were the 
only ones who defended me. In turn, I 
helped them in math. Sometimes, when

Please see RACE, page 6Atheist and theist alike should embrace concept of God
yvi
Yishan Wong
People who worship a god are 
in the least appropriate position 
to bear witness as to the nature of 
godhood. 
There is a particular distinc
tion regarding the morality of 
godhood that is frequently over
looked by atheist and theist alike. 
This is not surprising if one con
siders that the weight of discourse 
regarding godhood centers largely 
around its more, superficial as
pects, especially those bits relat
ing most to debate over its par
ticular implementation in spe
cific reality, as opposed to the 
moral aspects of divine nature.
Or, to put it b.luntly, all this 
talk about whether or not God 
exists, and if he does, what he 
does with his time, is irrelevant 
and beside the actual point.
He may or may not exist, but 
insofar as he may exist in any 
useful, distinguishable, or affec
tive form, his relevance to moral
ity is severely limited  the best 
philosophers in history, as well 
as the occasional lucid-minded 
free-thinker, have already cov
ered it far more rigorously than 
any denominational evangelist. 
Quite simply, would your life re
ally change if you ___________
found out God ex
isted? Would you 
suddenly become 
an altruist? If the 
apocalypse came 
around and the 
Forces of Darkness 
pulled a fast one and wonkilled 
God in front of your eyes, but 
decided to leave you to live your 
life as youd been doing  would 
you suddenly become a blasphem
ing sinner? I dont think so. Dont 
fool yourself about the real rea
sons you keep.
Despite this, many people con
tinue to fail to make the distinc
tion between the question of the 
existence of God and the question
of whether he ought to exist. The 
concept of God is an impressive 
one, and taken by itself, merits 
moral accord.
That is, I dont really think God 
exists, but I think he ought to. A 
neat little buzzword to describe 
this it to say that Im pro-god. 
This is not that difficult a concept 
to understand. One can both be
lieve that America ought to be
I am completely and fully in favor 
of the existence of God  I just 
dont happen to think it's so.
socialist, and yet still recognize 
the fact that it is the most capital
ist nation in the world. Similarly, 
its pretty clear to me that the 
evidence indicates that there 
are no gods in active existence, 
yet it would benefit all if one or 
some existed. I am completely 
and fully in favor of the existence 
of God  I just dont happen to 
think its so.
There are many reasons for this.
Consider, for one, the differences 
between six-day divine creation 
and evolution. While it seems that 
the sad truth is that we are the 
culmination of 4 billion years of 
proteinaceous roulette, an effi
cient, guided creation would have 
been much better. Go out on the 
street and take a look at the 
hordes of ugly, ugly people. Turn 
on the television and listen to the 
masses of stupid, 
stupid people. 
Made in the im
age of God, you 
say? I dont think 
so. The best evidence for evolu
tion (as a theory) 
is the fact that people are stupid, 
ugly, and act like monkeys. At 
the same time, it is the best evi
dence against evolution (as a 
moral objective). If wed been 
made by the hand of God, wed be 
better-looking, smarter, sexier, 
and healthier. As it is now, bad 
things continue to happen to good 
people every day.
If God existed (in one of his 
popular incarnations  perhaps
as benevolent white-bearded wise 
man in the sky), the world would 
certainly be a better place. But 
make no mistake  the world is 
crappy and God doesnt exist. In
stead of fooling ourselves, we 
should be working to make things 
the way we want. Set up govern
ment-sponsored programs after 
the fashion of the Bene Gesseritt 
breeding programs (from the 
Dune novels by Frank Herbert) 
to teach, train, and breed hu
mans with greater powers and 
moral fortitude. Yes, itll take 
hundreds of years, perhaps even 
thousands, but it is a goal worth 
our efforts.
Being an atheist doesnt mean 
being godless. It doesnt mean 
that youre resigned to living in a 
random, amoral, animistic uni
verse. It just means you know 
whats going on, and, perhaps, 
what to do. The concept of a god, 
once created, is a powerful moral 
idea. Be pro-god.

Violence mars patriotic experience
RACE, from page 5
But middle school was such a 
long time ago. Ive worked on 
blocking out those humiliating 
times  like that week when my 
ass was grabbed each time I went 
to my locker during rush hours. 
I was denying the possibility that 
Mary Would go through the same 
ordeal. Now she has it even worse 
than I did, at a younger age. When 
I was her age, I lived in China  
racism was a problem far, far 
away from me, in the land of 
capitalism. I read about the civil 
rights movement and swore that 
Id never be a racist. I just dont 
know what I think anymore. 
This entire ordeal was so ugly. 
The clich is that around each 
dark cloud theres a silver lin
ing. Where is it in this situation? 
Sure, my sister will no doubt be
come a stronger individualbut 
the tradeoff is losing her happiness. I wonder if she will ever 
play with kids the way she did 
before, especially black kids.
Im tempted to have Mary put 
in a tower and not released until 
its a good time  like poor 
Rapunzel. But thats not a solu
tion either. Maybe I should call 
my sister and tell her again 
and again that not all AfricanAmerican people are bad. 
Maybe Ill tell her about my first 
spelling teacher, who pushed me 
to earn 100s on my spelling tests, 
even though Id only been in 
America for about two months. 
Or maybe Ill tell her about 
Marcie, the nice lady who works 
at the UC, who always had a 
smile for each sleep-deprived and 
sick college student. How can I 
help Mary to see both sides of 
the matter, when shes not yet 
old enough to understand that 
not everything in life is absolute,
when she has no concept of the 
word absolute?
Mary never did anything to 
provoke anyone. Her idea of 
a good time is to sit down and 
draw a pretty picture, or skip 
ropes in the yard. The most 
offensive phrase she knows is 
Shut up! There is a time in 
everyones life when despair 
reaches its maximum  when 
people question what makes hu
man beings human and separ
ates them from beasts of the 
field. In the past, I thought I had 
been down that dark path. But I 
was mistaken  I simply wal
lowed in my own shadow of 
darkness. True despair can only 
be felt when you swear allegi
ance to a country and then it 
beats up your baby sister.

we had a gun culture, then guns 
would be no big deal. Having 
one would no longer be a power 
fix because running into a room

only receive bored stares.
The solution to our problems 
is not fewer guns, its more guns. 
Everyone should have a gun, 
starting with getting a .22 rifle 
as a kid. Proper gun usage 
should be taught in all schools.

Reality pales in comparison to video games
The Real Side of Sports
by Colt Foutz
To look at it from a pro basket
ball perspective, my old Power 
Mac 7100 was performing as well 
as Washington Wizards center 
George Muresan. Only five years 
into my college career, my Mac 
ran slowly, but mostly not at all.
I often had to give it some down 
time on the bench due to hard 
drive injuries. Many times I con
sidered cutting the Mac from the 
roster, but feared that when I 
tried to replace it, I would take a 
major salary cap hit. So I con
sulted with my general manager 
(mom), and received the neces
sary funds to trade old George 
away. Then I switched leagues. 
Thats right, I bought a PC.
If all these basketball refer
ences are confusing, just sit tight 
 they apply very well to 
computers,whose representation 
of basketball (via video games) 
can often be better than 
the original.
I made a great purchase when 
I bought my Dell OptiPlex, and I 
recommend it to anyone else whos 
thinking about switching from 
Mac to PC. I had only minimal 
trouble converting all my old Mac 
files, and its really nice to finally 
have a machine with RAM in the 
double digits. But I have to admit 
that I didnt buy my Dell because
I was dissatisfied with Mac, or 
itching to sell my soul to Bill 
Gates so I could experience the 
thrill of Microsoft Office 2000 on 
a 500 MHz machine. No, mostly I 
bought my PC so I could play EA 
Sports NBA LIVE 99 on 
my computer.
This is the third game in the 
NBA LIVE series that I own. The 
first two are for my Sega Genesis, 
but lets face it: The computer 
version of this game is a guaran
teed way to ensure your Sega will 
collect dust. Sure, Live 95 and I
had some good times. For in
stance, there was the season I 
traded all the Lakers to opposite 
corners of the earth and took the 
Clippers to the championship. Or 
the time I benched all the start
ers on the Utah Jazz for the whole 
season and career reserve John 
Crotty led the league in scoring, 
three-pointers, and steals. In my 
mind, I renamed the team the 
Utah Jerks, and we punched, 
kicked, and scowled our way to 
another NBA championship. 
True, even with a roster of cast
offs my basketball destiny was 
never in doubt: I still havent lost 
a game. But for this virtual gamer, 
its not so much about degree of 
difficulty, but degree of fun. How 
often can5'3" point guard Muggsy 
Bogues switch to center and go 
for a double nickel (55 points) 
on T Patrick Ewing a la Michael 
Jordan in 1995? The answer, at 
least in the computer game world, 
is: Anytime he wants.
And LIVE 99 offers even more 
features to help create my own 
NBA fantasy league, and thus 
right all the wrongs I see in the 
real basketball world. For in
stance, ever since Ive been a stu
dent at CMU Ive been pretty 
bummed that the former Pitts
burgh Pythons CBA franchise 
went bankrupt and folded. With 
the custom team feature on LIVE 
99 Ive corrected that injustice 
and then some. Ive taken the 
Pythons to the NBA, and, using 
the custom player tool, I filled out 
the roster with an assortment of 
under-six-foot midgets better rec
ognized as me and some friends 
from school.
And boy, can we runts ever com
pete with the regular NBA gi
ants. The Pythons not only 
outscored their opponents by an 
average of 140 points per game, 
and placed four starters on the 
All-Star team, they won two 
championships in a row. Of 
course, it didnt skew my vision of 
reality one bit that my virtual 
likeness (computer Colts wear
ing #45, and proud of it, people) 
won the MVP award. Hows that 
for virtual justice?
But the same video game pro
grammers that team up to make
our hoop dreams come true can 
also conspire to be a little too 
intrusive with their latest inno
vations. Earlier this month, EA 
Sports announced that they have 
reached a deal with Michael Jor
dan, former Chicago Bulls shoot
ing guard and certified media god, 
whereby Jordan will serve as a 
company spokesperson. What, 
like this guy needs more endorse
ment money? Werent the Ball 
Park Frank commercials embar
rassment enough?
What this announcement 
means to the video game world is 
that Jordan will finally appear in 
an electronic basketball game, 
beginning with NBA LIVE 2000, 
set for release this fall. This is a 
significant event, as any long
time sports video game player 
will tell you, because for the ma
jority of his career Jordan re
fused to allow his likeness to be 
used in any game. Say its 1997, 
and you want to create a rematch 
of the previous years NBA Fi
nals match-up between the Se
attle Supersonics and Jordans 
Bulls. Great idea, but your desire 
for a realistic grudge match will 
surely take a hit when you dis
cover Randy Brown taking 
Jordans place in the starting five.
Or you could take on Seattle in 
the popular NBA Jam line, where 
NBA stars square off in 2-on-2
action. The two best players for 
Chicago once you eliminate Jor
dan? Scottie Pippen and Toni 
Kukoc, whos known as the 
Michael Jordan of Croatia, 
which basically means that in 
America he shoots 3-pointers and 
gets knocked down a lot. 
Go Supersonics!
Well, Mr. Jordan, I think I 
speak for all EA Sports fans when 
I say, Too little, too late. Arent 
you supposed to be retired, any
way? EA Sports answered that 
problem by adding a new Leg
ends of the Game mode, which 
features all-star teams of NBA 
greats from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 
and 80s. Now you can match a 
team that includes Jordan, Isaiah 
Thomas, Moses Malone, and other 
stars from the 80s against the 
current NBA champion San An
tonio Spurs. If you want to, that 
is. Ill let you in on a little secret, 
though. You can do this on LIVE 
99 already, and without the en
hanced price tag.
Its simple. Do what I did, and 
do it your way. Go to the best 
place for digging up old player 
info, www.nba.com, and jot down 
all the specifics about your favor
ite players from the past. Wanna 
bring back the old Boston Celtics 
of the 1980s (my vote for ugliest 
team ever assembled)? Get the 
data on Kevin McHale, et al. right

here! From this site we find out 
McHale was 6'10", 210 pounds, 
played his college ball at the Uni
versity of Minnesota and, from 
the handy picture provided, wore 
a green brace on his left knee. 
And he was indeed pretty ugly, 
as far as white power forwards 
go. Now go to the custom player 
feature and put McHale in the 
game. Hell be taking outlet 
passes from Larry Bird and 
roughing up Bill Laimbeer in 
no time!
Next step, repeat this proce
dure for as many NBA old-timers 
and classic teams as you want. 
Cant decide whether you want 
the mutton-chopped and skyhigh-afroed Kareem AbdulJabbar of the 1971 champion 
Milwaukee Bucks, or the 80s 
Kareem with the chrome dome 
and goggles? Put em both in, 
and, please, call the 1971 guy 
Lew Alcindor. History will thank 
you for it.
In the current season Im play
ing, Ive got McHale, Bird, and 
Bill Russell all running the floor 
for the Celtics, with myself play
ing the point, of course. Anything 
is possible! Create your fantasy! 
Make Muggsy Bogues a 7'7", 350- 
pound monster! Cut George 
Muresan down to size and then 
trade him to the expansion Cin
cinnati Royals! See to it that
Charles Barkley plays well past 
his prime! Oh wait, thats reality.
The point is that there is useful 
innovation and intrusive innova
tion. Its up to the game players' 
to decide which is which, and 
whether to head for the bargain' 
bin to get the same, or better,' 
experience. Did I create Jordan 
for LIVE 99 after years of imag-! 
ining the ambiguously named 
Roster Player could hope to fill 
his sneakers? Sure I did, but Ill 
let you in on another secret: Hes, 
not even the best player on the' 
Bulls. That distinction belongs to! 
one Scottie Parrot, a flashy 5'6"! 
point guard traded from the leg-! 
endary Pittsburgh Pythons. Look' 
him up if you dont believe me. He 
goes to CMU, but is better known 
as Scott Sanner, mild-mannered 
ECE major. And god help Jordan 
if Parrot ever leaves via 
free agency.
Maybe next season?
Colt Foutz will contribute a 
weekly sports column to The Tar
tan this year. Check back next, 
week to see what sports icon he 
rips into next, and, if you see 
Charles Barkley around, kindly 
warn Colt to avoid plate glass 
windows. All thoughtful re
sponses to his views are appreci-, 
ated, but they had better be 
really funny.
team deserves more fan support
conference championships. Also, did you 
know that the team has participated in 
the Sugar Bowl and defeated Notre Dame 
four times? Sure, these events took 
place before World War II, but its still 
cool to hear about your school competing 
with the likes of Knute Rocknes Fight
ing Irish.
Todays fickle sports fans often care 
little for tradition if 
it is not accompa
nied by current suc
cess. However, the 
Tartans are defi
nitely not guilty of 
this. As I mentioned 
earlier, Saturdays 
win gave the squad 
a 40 record for the 
season. The team 
has been winning in 
impressive fashion, 
too, outscoring 
their opponents by 
a combined score of 
121-30.
Running back 
Mike Monsilovich 
and fullback Mike 
Campie have al
ready been named 
UAA offensive play
ers of the week this 
season, and line
backer Nick Zitelli 
has earned these 
honors on defense.
Before this past 
weeks game,
Campie needed 
only about 200 
yards to break 
CMUs career rush
ing record. The 
teams play has also 
garnered the atten
tion of their com
petitors, as the Tar
tans were ranked 
23 rd in the country 
in last weeks Divi
sion III coachs poll.
This weeks 2 pm game against 
Dickinson University has some extra 
attractions for potential fans. It is Home
coming Weekend, which usually pro
vides the largest and loudest crowd of 
the year, making for a more enjoyable 
experience for all the fans. The team will 
be extra focused and determined to per
form as they seek to revenge losses to 
Dickinson in each of the last two years. 
Topping things off, head coach Rich 
Lackner, already the schools winningest 
coach, has' the opportunity to earn his 
100th career victory.

trated, I was shocked upon seeing an 
article in the scorecard section that re
ferred to Carnegie Mellon football. That 
season, in order to try to stimulate larger 
game attendance, the athletic depart
ment gave away free floppy disks to 
students who attended football games.! 
This practice to appeal to the interests of! 
CMU students ended when the NCAA 
ruled that any promotional give
aways must be related to football.
I think that if youre a fan of 
college football, the game itself 
this Saturday should be enough 
to warrant your attendance.
Last year, I drove 10 hours to 
Athens, Georgia to watch the University of Georgia Bulldogs play! 
eventual national champion Ten-! 
nessee. I witnessed an eventwhich united an entire campus in! 
support of its team. It provided! 
the students with an opportunity! 
to relax, forget about school, hang! 
out with friends, and cheer on! 
their team. While CMU football! 
is nowhere near the level of! 
Georgias, the program is pretty! 
darned good compared to its com-! 
petition, and could potentially of-! 
fer many of the same benefits to! 
its students  on a much smaller! 
scale, of course.
The team has held up its end of! 
the bargain, now its up to you. 
Get some friends together. 
Saturday afternoon, do a little, 
tailgating, and head to the game 
to cheer on the Tartans. You 
wont regret it.
Pete Patterson will be in the', 
front row Saturday, screaming', 
his head off, acting like a mad-, 
man, and generally doing all the. 
other things a real football fan. 
should do. Otherwise, hes your 
everyday, junior IDS major with  
a cool column. He appreciates all 
thoughtful responses to his clair
voyant views.
Football
Between the Uprights
by Pete Patterson
Student apathy towards matters not 
involving direct personal consequence is 
an unfortunate problem at Carnegie 
Mellon. Voting, or lack thereof, in Stu
dent Government elections provide a 
striking example of this every year. The 
events that take place on autumn Satur
day afternoons at Gesling Stadium pro
vide no-less-compelling evidence of 
this phenomenon.
Consider last Saturday. On a cloud
less, 80-degree day, the CMU football 
team defeated Alfred 31-7. The Tartans 
displayed their usual blend of strong 
defense and steady offense to stretch 
their record to 4-0. The event was wit
nessed by a generous estimate of 1,500 
fans. This crowd consisted mainly of 
friends and families ofthe players, along 
with a couple hundred students.
I consider it the job of this column to 
provide the reader with interesting in
formation and opinion on events in the 
world of college football. This usually 
means giving my slant on a story of 
national interest, but in this case I am 
making an exception. Concentrating on 
the exploits of teams such as Florida 
State and Penn State can cause people 
to fail to realize that Carnegie Mellon 
has a team that plays a pretty decent 
brand of football itself.
So, what does CMU have to offer to 
you, the fan? Lets start with tradition. 
The program has an impressive string of 
24 consecutive winning seasons. Over 
this period the team has a record of 177 
50-4. Since the inception of the UAA in 
1990, the team has won or shared seven

10The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  27 September 1999Baseball prepares for postseason in style
Play Ball
by Matt Brun
'['1 know youve all been waiting on the 
eHge of your seats for the next install
ment of Play Ball after last weeks hia
tus (go with me on this one), so here goes. 
With less than two weeks left in the 1999 
regular season, pennant races are as hot 
as ever even as the weather gets cold.
But, before I handicap the final, fran
tic days of meaningless (sorry, Cleve
land reaction got out there) baseball 
before the playoffs, a quick recap of what 
you would have heard about last week.
I dont know if anyone outside of Ohio 
has noticed, but the Reds are for real. 
After hanging just behind the Houston 
Astros for most of the year, Cincinnati is 
making a statement that they deserve to 
be in the playoffs as much as anyone. 
The Reds are the pinnacle of smallmarket aspirations, and making the 
playoffs would be a huge deal. The real
1 question now is whether they can do it 
/.U^ain next year. Will this team prove to 
I 'be a perennial contender in the making, 
or just a bunch of overachieving young stars with middling talent?
"A bunch of talented young players led 
ty one genuine star  Greg Vaughn  
can only hold together so long before 
egos and greed step in and tear the team
apart. Such is the fate of small-market 
clubs in the world of professional sports 
today, and based on past trends, the 
future outlook isnt too good for the Reds.
Then again, maybe these guys will be 
different. I dont see Greg Vaughn stick
ing around too long; hes always been a 
money-hungry prima donna who will 
eventually price himself right out of Cin
cinnati. As for the rest of the team, I 
dont know, but I find it hard to be
lieve that all of them will stick
around and 
hefty raises.
If the Reds 1 
can stick to
gether for a few 
years, they could 
be a scary team. 
Im not sure that 
they could get to 
level of the IndiYankees, but 
level of talent 
adding a year or
not demand
the 
ans or 
given the 
there now, 
two of matu
rity may have folks dragging out 
their Big Red Machine paraphernalia.
Okay, thats it for my brief summary 
of last weeks non-existent column; now 
its on to the good stuff. Playoff predic
tions will have to wait for next week 
since we dont know whos going to be in 
yet, but here are my picks for who has 
the edge in the multiple pennant races 
around the league.
The American League is pretty much 
set. The Red Sox slumped just enough 
last week to make it all but impossible 
for them to catch the Yankees for the 
Eastern division crown, but the Athlet
ics fared even worse, dropping almost 
out of contention for the wild card.
For about a month, the Athletics were 
a bright shining hope in the American 
League. A smaller market than Cincin
nati, Oakland was a particular
favorite of Indians, Yan
kees, and Rangers
fans who 
dont 
want to
their teams facing 
Pedro Martinez in a 
short playoff series.
Reality finally 
struck last week, 
though, as the sus
pect pitching staff 
completely fell apart, ' 
leaving the As floun
dering in the Red 
Soxs wake. For those 
Toronto 
fans
Justin Suissa/Tartan Assistant
hoping for a glimpse of the 1992-93 
championship teams, some bad news  
the Blue Jays were mathematically 
eliminated last week.
The Indians finally made their divi
sion championship official, but the Tribe 
has some mixed news heading into the 
postseason. The good news is that the 
team is more or less healthy for the first 
time this year. Catcher Sandy Alomar 
Jr. and third baseman Travis Fryman 
have completed their rehab and started 
producing again, and reliever Steve 
Karsay is returning to the form that had 
us feather-heads excited back in July.
If last weeks series with the Yankees 
is any indication, however, this October 
could be another frustrating one for In
dians fans like myself. The Tribe dropped 
two of three to the hated Yanks, and 
generally have been on cruise control 
since the All-Star break. The teams 
stated goal of winning 100 games as a 
motivational factor is about out the win
dow (Cleveland is six wins shy of the 
century mark with seven games left to 
play) and, lets face it, its hard to show 
up every day when youre closest divi
sion rival is 25 games behind you.
With the two wins in Cleveland, the 
Yankees passed the Indians for the best 
record in the American League, which 
basically means nothing. Until the front 
office changes the ridiculous rule that 
teams from the same division cant 
play each other in the first round, 
match-ups will almost never see 
the number-one team play the 
number-four wild card.
As for the other playoff spot, 
Art Editor the Rangers were practically 
given the title when the Angels 
self-destructed early in the year. The 
Athletics have kept close enough to keep 
them from clinching, but like the Red 
Sox, theyre too far behind.
Look for the Yankees and Rangers to
clinch their respective divisions within 
the next few days, and for the Red Sox to 
get the wild card once again.
The National League is where everyr 
thing is going to come down to the wire;. 
Except for the Western division cham
pion Diamondbacks, every playoff spoj; 
is still up for grabs.
The East is sorting itself out as exfpected: the Braves are holding stead^ 
while the Mets fall off the pace. If last 
weeks three-game sweep at the hand& 
of the Braves is any indication (and yoii 
can bet it is), the Mets still arent quite 
ready to challenge Atlanta. New York 
slipped to six games behind Atlanta, 
and even if they sweep the seasons final 
series against the Braves (not likely), 
things dont look too good.
A much more pressing concern to the 
Mets is the recent surge of the Reds. As 
I write this article, the Reds have passed 
the Mets in the wild card race.
While theyve caught the Mets, the 
Reds arent done yet. Cincinnati sits 
only one and a half games behind Hous
ton in the Central. The Astros havenlt 
been playing exceptionally well lately, 
but they should be able to motivate them
selves to hold off the Reds charge.
The Braves should clinch this week, 
and I expect Houston to survivje 
Cincinnatis assault and take the divi
sion. The Reds ought to be able to kee 
up their good play, while the Mets still 
have that series against Atlanta. Expecjt 
the Mets to falter against the Brayes 
and hand the wild card to Cincinnati.!

Tartans win with defense
SHUTOUT, from page 12
Hopper continued their excel
lent play, which, combined with 
the effective play of senior cap
tain Benjamin Kartzman and 
sophomore Tom Dougherty in 
goal, held the opposing team 
scoreless for a third straight 
game. Waynesburgs only real 
scoring threat came in the sec
ond half, when one of their 
forwards smacked a header on 
goal from about six yards out. 
This chance was stopped when
They dont call him Keeper 
Tom for nothing! said Nabeel 
Far ah, an excited fan.
The Tartans took their win
ning ways on the road last 
Saturday for their first Uni
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) game of the season at 
the University of Chicago. The 
defense continued its amaz
ing streak as the team re
corded their fourth straight 
shutout. The offense struggled 
against the tough Chicago
The Tartans are 5-1 on the young season, including 1-0 in the 
UAA following Saturdays win over Chicago.
Dougherty quickly snatched pressure, but the defense made 
Waynesburgs single hope out the lone tally stand up as the 
of the air and punted it away, team won 1-0.
NFL teams fool columnist
In The Red Zone
by Nathan Steinwald
Week three of the NFL season 
is over, for the most part, and it 
was unenlightening. There were 
a few important games. The Minnesota-Green Bay game showed 
everyone how much these teams 
dislike each other. Denver showed 
how bad things can get in one 
year, and Pittsburgh showed how 
bad they can be when not playing 
an expansion team.
The most compelling story of 
the week in football came from off 
the field, in fact. Dimitrius 
Underwood was found stabbed 
and bleeding on the city streets of 
Lansing, Michigan. Not much else 
is known now, except that 
Underwood is having a pretty 
bad year all things considered. 
First he walked out of Vikings 
training camp because of spiri
tual conflicts. Then he decided to 
try again with the Dolphins and 
dislocated a shoulder. Now, who 
knows what has happened.
Green Bay and Minnesota 
played the grudge-match of the 
week, and tempers were flaring 
early. The fact that Randy Moss 
was bottled up and that Green 
Bay sort o/redeemed themselves 
after losing to Detroit last week, 
thatDetroit lost, andthatTampa 
Bay won means that the only 
certainty in the NFC Central is 
that Chicago is not going to the
playoffs. I expect that Detroit will 
come back to Earth after their 
meteoric start. The Buccaneers 
showed that they need an offense 
before they can contend. Whether 
or not they can find one is a mys
tery, and until it is solved, Green 
Bay and Minnesota are the two 
best teams in the division.
In the AFC central, the teams 
are also starting to sort them
selves out. Pittsburgh lost big 
time, and as I expected, Coach 
Cowhers reaction was to bench 
Kordell Stewart. He did throw 
three interceptions, but just let 
him struggle sometimes. The 
game was already lost, and he 
needs to feel pressure and be able 
to react to it if he is going to be a 
quality QB in the NFL.
The Titans upset the mighty 
Jaguars in fine comeback fashion 
this week, showing that Jackson
ville will have to work hard to get 
their division championship and 
that the Titans are for real.
When I first wrote that the New 
York Jets wouldt take the divi
sion, it was with the expectation 
that Vinn}' Testaverde would 
make it through the season. His 
injury was unfortunate, but they 
have to deal with it a little better 
than going 0-3 if they want to 
prove that they have the support
ing cast around Vinny to have 
made a Super Bowl run. Miami 
had the week off and Buffalo 
looked good, but they were play
ing Philadelphia.
The NFC East still needs a week
or more to sort itself out a little 
bit, but Washington won again. 
Dallas gets the week off, but they 
are still 2-0 and have looked good. 
The Cardinals face a desperate 
San Francisco team tonight, but 
Arizona has every reason to Liv 
just as desperate.
San Francisco and Atlanta have 
joined Denver in thisyears worstof-last-years-best category. CaEOr 
lina finally won and New Orleans 
took the week off, but St. Louis 
leading the NFC West? I did not 
think that this would happen.
Finally, the AFC West, where 
it looks like Seattle, Oakland, and 
Kansas City are about to enter a 
three-way tug of war. There 
havent been many inter-conference games, but it looks like Den
ver and San Diego should start 
bracing for a bad year.
Some of you have probably 
reached this point and are won
dering why I am continually try
ing to see who will make the play
offs and who will not. Well, do yfpu 
have any better ideas? Isnt the 
regular season all about the play
offs? I think it is to the playejrs, 
and I think some trends are 
emerging. This year, more than 
ever, is about upheaval. Some 
traditionally good teams are still 
good. Some bottom dwellers still 
havent found the stairs out of me 
basement. However, it looks like 
some teams have traded uniforms 
and not told anyone about it. The 
landscape is changing. Youmight 
as well throw out your old road 
maps. This season will be ;a 
wild ride.

Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff all responses to his uiews.Tartans week features up-and-down efforts
SOCCER, from page 12
Shortly after, first-year midfielder Me
lissa McMorrow got free on a pass from 
junior midfielder Kim Celone, but the 
' Carlow goalkeeper was there once again 
; to stuff the shot.
As the game progressed, CMU steadily 
racked up more and more chances as the 
; Carlow defense tired. McMorrow ripped 
| a pair of blasts within two minutes, but 
both efforts ended up about a foot wide. 
The Tartans had one final chance with 
less than two minutes to play when Gaul 
freed herself in the box for a cross, but, 
once again, the goalkeeper punched the 
ball away.
On the counter-attack from that play, 
Carlow got their lone offensive chance of 
the game. A breakdown in the CMU 
defense left two Carlow forwards wide 
open for a cross on the far post. If not for 
a bad pass across the box, Carlow would 
have stolen a victory in the final minute.
As it was, the game went to overtime,
where Carlow finally showed the fatigue 
of having played a full 90 minutes. In the 
first minute of sudden-death overtime, 
McMorrow finished a cross from 
Wermine to give the Tartans the win.
The 1-0 final was in no way indicative 
of the course of play throughout the 
game. Carlows strategy of sitting back 
included not pressing the attack, lead
ing to a 32-2 shot advantage for the 
Tartans. First-year goalkeeper Maya 
Nigrosh was forced to make only one 
save during the game, an easy chance on 
a long-range shot.
Having concluded their three-game 
homestand undefeated, the Tartans 
went back on the road for their first 
University Athletic Association (UAA) 
match of the season against the Univer
sity of Chicago.
Once again, the team played a tough 
game and never quit. Offensively, the 
Tartans regained some of the form that 
earned them victories over Mount Union
and Marietta, but struggled against a 
skilled Chicago team.
Defensively, the team held tough 
and didnt allow many chances on goal. 
What chances the Maroons got, they 
capitalized on, though, taking the lead 
and not letting the Tartans back in the 
game. A combination of nice play by 
the Maroons and mistakes by the Tar
tans allowed Chicago to go up by two 
goals, and the Tartans were never 
able to recover.
In the end, the Maroons were just 
too much for CMU to handle, and the 
Tartans lost 2-0.
The team will look to rebound from 
the loss on Tuesday when they play at 
Penn State University-Behrend. The 
next home game is on Sunday, Octo
ber 3 against the University of Washington-St. Louis, a UAA opponent.
The teams record for the season 
stands at 4-3-1 overall, and 0-1-0 in 
the UAA.

The CMU mens soccer team took the 
home turf on Tuesday night against an 
outmatched Waynesburg College team 
in an attempt to gain their third 
straight victory.
The Tartans were winners last year, 
by a 6-2 margin. Waynesburg still main
tained hope, however, that five starting 
first-years and two key CMU injuries 
would help to even the playing field. 
These hopes collapsed near the end of 
the first half, as a four-goal barrage from 
the Tartans settled any questions about 
what the games final outcome was go
ing to be. The Tartans posted another 
goal midway through the second half to 
bring the final score to 5-0. This was the 
third straight shutout win for the prom
ising Tartan squad.
This game was no less important than 
any other. If we want to accomplish our 
goal of qualifying for NCAAs, then we 
need to remember that every game from 
here out is a must win, and means the 
season, said junior midfielder David 
Zupon. Zupon, recently named UAA of
fensive player of the week because of a 
three-goal performance last Saturday, 
added two goals in the match, and 
brought his team-leading season total to 
six. Daves been playing like a house on 
fire, said senior midfielder John Petrillo, 
who also added two assists in Tues
days match.
The Tartans offense dominated the 
match throughout. They pounded 
Waynesburg in the first half, their first 
goal coming in the 26th minute on a leftfooted blast from Zupon. The keeper had
no chance at the shot and could only 
watch as it curled into the right side of 
the net. The Tartans struck again only 
three minutes later when sophomore 
midfielder Brian Morgan scored on a 
header which he knocked just out of the 
keepers reach. In the 41st minute, firstyear midfielder Adam Hibshman made 
the score 3-0 when he headed in a free 
kick, and, only minutes later, first-year 
forward Matt DiGiacomo knocked in his 
fifth goal of the season to give the Tar
tans a 4-0 lead to carry into the second 
half. Zupon later added his second goal 
of the night on a header during the 67th 
minute of play to bring the tally to 5-0.
The Tartan defense made its presence 
felt by completely shutting down the 
Waynesburg offense. Senior defenders

were the undefeated Alfred Sax
ons now they are just the Alfred 
Saxons. The CMU football team 
battled Alfred at home on Satur
day, and once again emerged vic
torious, improving their record 
to 4-0.
Alfred was a strong team, but 
CMU put the pressure on from 
the first minute and pounded 
their opponent all day long. The 
offense ran the ball all over Alfred. 
The defense caused Alfreds quar
terback to throw on the run on 
almost every play. With their 
persistence on both sides of the
ball, CMU had Alfred on the de
fensive for the entire game.
The first touchdown of the game 
came in the first three minutes, 
when Alfreds workhorse running 
back fumbled the ball at the Alfred 
16-yard line. Senior linebacker 
Todd Connelly recovered the 
fumble, and, three plays later, 
senior fullback Mike Campie ran 
the ball in for a touchdown.
The rest of the first quarter 
was back and forth, but CMU 
clearly had the upper hand. The 
defense held Alfred to zero pass
ing yards and only two first 
downs. The offense fought hard 
as well, and at the end of the 
quarter, senior running back

ball 47 yards for a touchdown. 
Monsilovich had 83 yards in the 
first quarter, 66 of which were in 
the last drive alone.
The second quarter was a stale
mate. Both teams played solid 
defense, but could not produce 
anything on offense. Alfred had 
one interception and forced a 
fumble, but was unable to capi
talize on either of them. If Alfred 
ever had a chance to come back, it 
was then. The CMU offense soon 
began hammering the nails into 
the coffin.
Early in the third quarter, 
Alfred fumbled on their own 24- 
yard line, leaving CMU within 
lethal range of the end zone.
Campie carried the 
ball for 22 of those 24 
yards, and finished 
the drive with his

Festival brings small country to light
fesitval photos Lisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Managing Editor
I By NATHAN STEINWALD
I Tartan Contributing Editor
I Last Saturday the mid-autumn festi| vai, a traditional Chinese celebration, 
| was held at Carnegie Mellon. Rain on 
Friday night forced organizers to post
pone the event by one day, but the fes
tival didnt miss a beat as both organiz
ers and a attendees in Merson Court
yard enjoyed themselves.
This year, the second year of the fes
tival at Carnegie Mellon, Merson 
Courtyard served as host to the event 
instead of the Physical Plant building 
where the event was held last year. The 
courtyard was decorated with about 
400 lanterns, a large lantern at the 
courtyard entrance, and a banner that 
reluctantly rolled out at the beginning 
of the Moon Cake Festival skit put on 
by the organizers. The goal of th event 
was to celebrate the event, but also 
to inform the rest of campus 
about the tradition and bring the 
community together.
[The goal of] it is first to admire the 
moon, since it was a full moon, said 
senior business administration major 
and President of Awareness of Roots of 
Chinese Culture (ARCC) Emily Chiu. 
Its to celebrate the overcoming of the 
Mongolians and to just celebrate being 
with others.
[The festivals purpose] was to edu
cate everyone about the Chinese Moon 
Festival and Chinese culture, said
junior electrical and computer engi
neering major and vice president of the 
Singapore Students Association (SSA), 
Sy Bor Wong. Anywhere there are Chi
nese people, this is celebrated.
I think it is very important; it brings 
the whole community together, said 
junior business administration major 
Becky Lai. Supposedly it is to admire 
the moon. Last night the moon was 
really round, and there is a story of a 
moon lady. That is why we have the 
moon cakes.
Wong and Yuan Xu, a junior business 
administration major and vice-presi
dent of the ARCC, were co-MCs for the 
event. SSA and ARCC collaboratively 
organized the event, which featured 
a martial arts display, a small play, 
music, games, and, of course, 
mo.on cakes.
The evening started at 7:30 with 
martial arts displays. The Aikido Club, 
Shotokan Karate Club, and Tae Kwon 
Do Club each performed for the crowd. 
Afterward the lighting ceremony sig
naled the beginning of the evenings 
skit. The lanterns decorating the court
yard pulsed to the rhythm of drum 
based music, and with a dramatic fin
ish all of the lights came on and the fes
tivals banner was unveiled to the spec
tators. Well, almost. A stingy slip-knot 
refused to let the banner unfurl, but 
after a moment the problem was fixed, 
and the banner rolled out to the 
applause of the crowd.
After the banner rolled out, the play 
began. With more lighting and fanfare, 
a different story was presented than 
the one chosen last year.
There are lots of stories for the moon 
cake festival, said junior computer 
science major Choon Hong Peck, who is
[The festivals pur
pose7 was to educate 
everyone about the 
Chinese Moon festival 
and Chinese culture. 
Anywhere there are 
Chinese people this is 
celebrated.
 Sy Bor Wong 
Vice President,. SSA
the president of SSA. Every year we 
try to have a different theme. Last year 
we had the story of the Moon-Lady. 
The 10-minute skit told the story of 
the Lunar Uprising, a Chinese rebel
lion against Mongolian conquerors. The
story is that during the lunar festival 
notes were distributed to the people in 
moon cakes, telling them when the 
rebellion would start.
Yueming Yu of the Modern Lan
guages Department and dean of H&SS 
Peter Stearns narrated the story, and 
each segment was presented with Chi
nese narration followed by the English 
equivalent. Lighting by AB and 
well-planned direction made the play 
a success.
The entire planning for the event 
began months ago:
We started planning before the sum
mer, said Peck. Everything came 
from Singapore. It took a month to get 
the lanterns ready because it was all 
custom-done here.
The planning and preparation that 
went into the- skits, the decorations, 
and the overall theme of the evening 
were worth it to onlookers.
As an overall event it was pretty 
good, said junior ECE major Francis 
Goh. There were a lot of people and 
they had a good line-up. The play 
was pretty fast-paced and actually 
pretty accurate.
Chiu said that part of the reason for 
the good turnout is that students from 
Singapore held similar events back 
home and that this was a chance to 
relive some of those good times with 
friends here at CMU.
After the play the formal part of the 
evening was complete. Moon cakes and
tea were offered free to all, and some of 
the tables of the courtyard had more 
activities for students. Games like Carrom and Wei Chi (go) were set up, along 
with lantern-making stations where 
students could construct their own 
lunar festival lantern.
The evening melted into a relaxed 
gathering in the colorfully lit court
yard. Students enjoyed the good 
weather and company of their friends.
Im from Singapore, so back in high 
school they would open up the gates of 
the school and let us march in, 
said Goh. After it got dark we would 
sit around with friends and 
just chit-chat.
Organizers of the event were pleased 
with the turnout. There are so many 
people, its great, said Xu. We started 
[constructing the lanterns] about three 
or four weeks beforehand.Every Thurs
day and Friday we had three-hour 
work sessions.... Last year was our 
first year trying it. It was over by the 
Physical Plant building, so it was kind 
of isolated. We still had a good turnout, 
but this year it was bigger and 
grander. We didnt have a backdrop or 
the lanterns.
Chiu estimated that over 300 people 
attended the event. She is hoping that 
this year ARCC will be able to hold 
some of the other events it has been a 
part of in the past, including an inter
national food festival, an Asian Mar
ket, and movie nights.
Painter mixes Eastern heritage with pop culture
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Contributing Editor
Bart Simpson has left Spring
field and been wounded. Super
man has flown from Metropolis 
and picked up a knife. Clowns 
have left the circus to join the 
other two characters in Melt
ing Souls, the current exhibit at 
the Hewlett Gallery.
The show by Entang Wiharsoconsists of seven large-scale 
paintings, all of which synthesize world pop images with
Wiharsos native Indonesian cul
ture. My work is the manifesta
tion of contact with the outer 
world, characterized by despair, 
hypocrisy, violence, complexity, 
and compromise, as well as by 
my inner spiritual worlds, 
characterized by hope, 
conflict dreams, and anxiety, 
said Wiharso.
Both worlds do exist in eveiy one 
of the pieces in Melting Souls; that 
is clear. However, tiying to dissect 
the work is a challenge, as each piece 
is made up of numerous elements,
which do not always seem to be 
linked together.
Even though each painting is 
largely made up of bright colors, 
signifying optimism, the images 
are nonetheless haunting. Upon 
further inspection, one notices 
that the bright colors are merely a 
contrast to Wiharsos critique of 
contemporary culture, and the 
dark areas and morbid subject 
matter are emphasized. Working 
figuratively, Wiharsos figures are 
distorted, and it is not always 
clear as to how human the figcourtesy Hewlett Gallery
Lock Our Hearts, (above) is one of Entang Wiharsos paintings in this months Hewlett Gallery show.
ures are  many of the subjects 
wear masks; some have 
animal characteristics.
The nightmarish qualities are 
drawn out well aesthetically, 
often resembling the work of 
Francis Bacon; however, further 
explanation of the artists sym
bolism would allow viewers to 
have a better understanding of 
Wiharsos intentions.
Cultural Burden, the first 
painting that the viewer 
encounters in the show, is a 
prime example of Wiharsos 
other exhibited works. The 
mural portrays a half- clown, 
half-beast in five different 
stages. The first four life-size 
figures appear to have wounds 
on their hearts, but in the final 
painting, the wounded area is 
stitched, and his heart is fas
tened with a padlock.
Lock Our Hearts has similar 
composition and is organized in 
nearly the same way as Cultur
al Burden: five figures on five 
separate panels. However, 
rather than clowns, Wiharso 
uses traditional superhero cos
tumes to portray the subjects. 
Each superhero wears a lock on 
his heart, but, even more 
grotesquely, each man including 
Superman carries a knife.
Violence and pain are constant 
themes in Wiharsos work. In 
Bart Simpson has Illness, he 
takes what the American public 
would consider a light subject
and integrates the cartoon into a 
dark world. I keep seeing how 
the media keeps impacting peo
ple, stimulating them, and the 
Simpsons seemed to represent 
American life, said Wiharso. 
In tackling global issues, I tried 
to use Eastern and Western 
influences for global themes 
and technology.
The top two thirds of the 
painting show Bart Simpson 
upside down, with his stomach 
sliced open as a devilish figure 
inserts a revolver into the 
wound. The bottom third is 
made up of darker colors and 
goblin-like figures.
Not only does Wiharso choose 
to create gruesome images, but 
he also paints in a way that 
emphasizes the brutality of his 
work. Rather than merely use 
the paintbrush in the tradition
al sense, he also etches into his 
paintings, building up multi-lay
ered surfaces with numerous 
coats of paint as well as pho
tographs, and uses pencil on his 
canvases.
Most obviously deviating from 
standard painting is Exorcism 
in the Stomach, which consists 
of one panel made up of 12 
images of smiling faces, one 
panel made up of 12 images of 
stomachs, and a middle panel 
which has a 3D bucket, labeled 
fixed, hanging upside-down on 
the panels top portion. Wiharso 
is pushing the definition of
painting by collaging the 3D 
sculpture onto the 2D piece.
The largest piece, Landscap
ing My Brain, utilizes many of 
the artists typical elements: 
angels, devils, ambiguous fig
ures, and Bart Simpson. Since it 
fills an entire wall in the gallery, 
the nightmarish and surreal 
qualities which exist in Wihar
sos other work are even more 
overwhelming in this particular 
painting. [In Landscaping my 
Brain] I wanted to incorporate 
my own views on religion and 
global issues. Its still not fin
ished; I am still increasing pan
els, said Wiharso.
All seven pieces in the exhib
it were completed over a sixmonth period, which may be 
one reason for the repeated 
themes and content throughout 
the exhibit. However, Wiharso 
has been focused on these ideas 
since he received his BFA from 
the Art Institute of Indonesia in 
1994. Because I am uniquely 
situated on the cusp of old and 
new, East and West, I try to 
pull from my experiences uni
versal moral messages,
he said.
The weakness of the Melt
ing Souls is that these mes
sages and symbols are not 
made extremely clear.
However, the show is suc
cessful in its concepts, and 
the paintings are very 
well-executed.

Filmmakers talk brings works to life
By ROB CULLEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday in McConomy Audito
rium, CFA hosted renowned local inde
pendent filmmaker Tony Buba as part 
of its visiting lecturer series. These lec
tures bring professional artists from 
various disciplines to CMU to talk 
about their craft.
Buba has been making films profes
sionally since graduating from the Uni
versity of Ohio with an MFA in 1976. 
In his lecture he showed clips from 
some of his early student films. His 
first film was made in 1973, during 
graduate school, when he was 
depressed and driving home every 
weekend. Its a quirky, funny 16mm 
mockumentary about a furniture sales
man in his hometown of Braddock. The 
actors from this movie would appear in 
many of Buba's films throughout 
the years.
Over his career he has completed 22 
short films and three feature-length 
projects, which have received awards 
both nationally and internationally.
His first feature film, Lightning Over 
Braddock  a Rustbowl Fantasy, 
was shown at the Sundance Film FesSpirit Award in Los Angeles. This

His films are quirky, and often tragic 
and humorous at the same time. One of 
the films he showed was a 9.6 minute 
film he made for the Pittsburgh Center 
for the Arts. The film begins a fade-out 
from the first frame as he films one shot 
of cars driving through the town and is 
subtitled with the formula he used to 
come up with the 9.6 minute length and 
about the acid he did in the 70s.
As shown in his films, Buba loves 
his hometown, slowly becoming a 
ghost town since the local economy 
collapsed with the fall of the steel 
mills, and as a section of the PA Turn
pike is being built though the town. 
Currently, hes working on several 
films including one in which he inter
views his relatives from Italy. In addi
tion, he is on the Braddock borough 
council. When asked why he stayed at 
home in the Pittsburgh area, instead 
of moving on to major studio projects, 
he said it was because of the knowl
edge that his work, which documents 
a specific part of the history of this 
area, will have value and be watched 
after he's gone.

This past weekend the Singapore Stu
dents Association (SSA) held their 
Mid-Autumn Festival. The festival, 
which included games, food, and enter
tainment, was a success according to 
Choon Hong Peck, a junior computer 
science major and president of the Sin
gapore Students Association.
Peck and his fellow SSA members 
spent much of the semester working on 
plans for the weekend. In addition to 
putting together the festival, SSA works 
to increase awareness of Singapores 
diversity. SSA will have a presentation 
at the Asian International Festival, 
which starts on October 14, that will 
aim to further raise awareness of Sin
gapore. Recently, The Tartan sat down 
with Peck for an interview.
The Tartan: What was the event?
Choon Hong Peck: Its a festival 
that is celebrated by Chinese all 
over the world. There are a lot of 
stories behind it, and this year we 
focused on the Lunar Rising, which 
is why we ate the moon cakes. We 
had a play that actually depicted 
the whole story  it has, to a cer
tain extent, a historical basis. When 
the Mongols invaded China, the Chi
nese were oppressed, and they [the 
Chinese] had the idea to make moon 
cakes, and they put little notes 
inside to let other people know
about the uprising. Last year we 
had the story of the moon fairy. 
Every year, we try to think of new 
stories and stories that relate to this 
festival.
TT: How did it go?
CP: It went really well. The decora
tions were great  we put in a lot of
small quirks here and there.
IT: What were some of the positive 
aspects of the festival?
CP: The play was really good. Foodwise, it was okay. Lighting was great. 
We managed to get the CFA lights and 
the tennis court lights switched off so we 
were able to make it darker. The games

work for the decorations. One thing sad 
about it was that it was supposed to be 
done Friday, and I looked at the weath
er and I decided to postpone it. In terms 
of turnout, we probably had fewer peo
ple than would have come on a Friday. 
Other than that, it was a great event, 
and things went well except for a few
were there, and people were playing 
them. There were puzzles on the trees. 
These are all things that people do tra
ditionally. The lanterns were handmade 
by us, and in fact, everything was hand
made by us. This was on a bigger scale 
 decorations were much elaborate.
TT: What are some of the things that
youve done in the past, and are going 
to happen in the future?
CP: I was activities manager last year. 
We hope to create a tradition, and keep 
it going, and hopefully it will be better 
next year. Events-wise, the next one 
coming up will be the Singapore Expo, 
which will be inline with the Asian Fes
tival and will mainly contain informa
tion about Singapore, and it will hope
fully raise awareness. We did caving 
last year, and we did white-water raft
ing last year, which we may do again 
this year. But, in terms of activities, our 
peak is just about now, and things 
should taper off for the rest 
the semester.
TT: What are some of the things that 
make the Singaporean culture unique 
amongst other Asian cultures?
CP: We are different in a sense 
because we are more mixed in terms c 
racial [composition]. There are Indians 
in Singapore, and there are Malays in 
Singapore. SSA is not at all an exclusive 
group. In fact, yesterday we had some 
Hong Kong students helping out. [Many] 
people have ties to Singapore. I think its 
mainly about diversity. I do feel that peo
ple have misconceptions about Singa
pore. You hear about No chewing gum,' 
and caning, which is quite a warped 
view. People dont really know what [the 
country] is about. The language is com
pletely different  Singlish is very 
unique  I wouldnt call it weird, but 
weswitch between two languages. Its a 
very unique culture.
Groovy baby...

Ive said it before, and Ill say it again: lizards arent 
cute. I mean, sure, wed all love a cold-blooded pet 
who eats insects and can go into a dormant state called 
torpor. If I had a lizard, Id call him Torpy. But, to get 
back to the point, Torpy certainly wouldnt be cute by 
any stretch of the imagination. Stretch... hmm, I won
der if lizards would look cute in little lizard stretch pants?

Phones ringing "Hello...hello?" "Greetings, 
your number has been randomly selected 
from a pool of millions of contestants to be 
the proud new owner of a plot of the finest 
land in all the land! This hole in the ground 
has it all for all your loved ones. Valued at 
over $800 this plot of land will fit even the 
largest of your family members! Did the old 
man have too much jello as he lingered,
Did the old bag put on a few before she 
croaked, haVe no fear, we'll squeeze them 
in there! Yes there's nothing quite like a 
plot of land in the scenic Swarthsfield 
Cemetery. And now for some questions. How 
old are you?" I was taken aback by her 
saleswoman ship, "20". She replied with some 
reluctance "Well will you use the plot?
You sound a bit young to me, this is serious."
After shopping around a bit I spotted a sickly 
old man who was clinging on to life with his 
last bit of life-force. I pounced on him like a 
tiger hunting the weakest zebra, it was an easy 
kill. Unfortunately people seemed to be upset 
and the police didn't understand where I was 
coming from. I sit here in jail, patiently waiting 
for the day I can finally fill that hole in the 
ground that was randomly selected as my destiny.
I replied abruptly, "I have a feeling I won't be 
needing a burial plot anytime soon, but I can't 
pass up a bargain like this! I'll take it!" Three 
weeks later and the plot still remained unused, 
it felt like I was wasting one of my god given 
talents, guilty for not using my prize. I decided 
to take action. I put some panties over my face, 
and roamed the crowded noon-time streets of 
downtown Boston, wielding a large steak knife.

Movie gives dose of 
cinematic therapy
By BALAJISARPESHKAR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
I have often wondered about psy
chologists. One can only imagine the 
things they must hear from their pa
tients. In Mumford, the somewhat 
unorthodox new film from writer/di
rector Lawrence Kasdan, we are given 
some insight into the secret lives of a 
small group of people.
As the movie opens, we are introduced 
to Dr. Mumford, a young psychologist in 
a small town that, by some strange coin
cidence, is also called Mumford. The doc
tor has been in town for only four months, 
and he is already the most sought-after 
therapist. His popularity, it turns out, is 
due to his unusual methods oftreatment.
The good doctor, as we soon see, has a 
habit of being completely honest  he 
will not hesitate to tell a patient what he 
tliinks might be wrong with thfem. This 
honesty quickly wins him the confidence 
of Mumfords residents.
What also helps is that some of Dr. 
Mumfords patients are somewhat unor
thodox themselves. There is Althea (Maiy 
McDonnell), the compulsive mail-order 
shopper, Henry (Pruitt Taylor Vince),

Davis) in Mumford, released by Buena Vista Pictures.

1950s-style pom fantasies, and Nessa 
(Zooey Deschanel), the teenage glamour 
magazine addict.
For all that we are told about his pa
tients, however, we are told very little 
about Mumford himself. This all changes
when the doctor meets Skip Skipperton 
(Jason Lee), the young billionaire whose 
company produces 23 percent of the 
worlds modems, but who cannot seem to 
connect with a woman.
As Skip does not want it to be publicly 
known that he is seeking therapy, he 
asks the doctor to become his friend. 
Through this treatment/friendship, we 
are further introduced to the enigmatic 
Dr. Mumford. When Skip reveals to the 
doctor his biggest secret, that he is work
ing on a virtual sexual surrogate-slashcompanion to ameliorate his loneliness, 
Mumford reveals his secret to Skip.
While all this male bonding is going 
on, Mumford is introduced to a new 
patient, Sophie, who suffers from 
chronic fatigue syndrome. His unor
thodox treatment for her involves such 
things as walking through the woods 
and working a paper route. In time, it 
becomes apparent that the doctor 
has developed feelings for this par
ticular patient.
The humor of this film is quite pos
sibly its strongest element. The jokes 
are slightly under-played, allowing 
us to focus more on the characters 
and their myriad problems. Martin 
Short has a great 
role as the sleazy 
criminal attorney 
who is trying to 
discover Dr. 
Mumfords secret, 
and there is even 
an appearance by 
Robert Stack, who 
skillfully plays ... 
himself, of course.
By the end of the 
film, we see each 
of the doctors pa
tients come to 
terms with their 
problems and 
form romantic relationships with each 
other. Even the good doctor finds love, 
which leads one to believe that the 
happy ending is a trifle cliched. How
ever, since we see some actual char
acter development, the movie itself 
might just be therapy of a sort.
Film bonds with audience

Imagine having only one arm to call 
your own, the inability to move freely, 
and an entire life without experiencing 
a single moment of privacy. To con
joined twins Blake and Francis Falls, 
these are the reali
ties of life. Twin Falls 
Idaho, indepen
dently directed and 
co-written by identi
cal twins Michael 
and Mark Polish and 
later picked up by 
Sony Pictures for na
tional release, exam
ines the powerful 
bond of brotherhood 
and the emotional 
complications which 
arise when two 
people share the 
same body.
When Penny 
(Michelle Hicks), a 
prostitute, arrives at 
Idaho Avenue in
tending to meet 
Francis Falls 
(Michael Polish), 
little does she know 
that Blake Falls 
(Mark Polish) will be a part of the 
equation. Though she is initially scared, 
her financial troubles and the twins 
medical dependency bring the three 
together. Fascinated by the powerful 
bond between Blake and Francis, Penny 
becomes drawn into the dynamic be
tween the twins, and finds herself fall
ing in love.
In taking care of the twins, Penny 
comes to realize that Francis, the left 
half, relies upon his brothers internal 
organs to survive, and that without 
Blakes heartbeat his own heart could 
not sustain him. While Francis is un
conscious during illness, she becomes 
attracted to the dedication which 
Blake shows toward his brother, find
ing that within the single body are two 
distinct people.
Almost all of the characters, aside 
from the twins and Penny, are pre
sented briefly with little depth and rep
resent society at large more than selfcontained individuals. The presentation 
of such secondary characters leaves the 
twins isolated, and the physical and 
emotional bonds between brothers are 
tested. Despite the conveyed normalcy 
of the twins lives  they communicate 
with each other in shorthand and even

than the two twins, for their world can

Fashion model turned actress Michelle 
Hicks makes an impressive debut on the 
screen in a demanding role. As Penny, 
she becomes the link that the Falls broth
ers have to society and, as the love inter
est of Blake, she becomes the first real 
threat to the union between the broth

The film deals with the complex con
cepts of personal space and social accep
tance, and proved to be more thoughtprovoking than all of this summers block

big at the box office as The Blair Witch 
Project, another critically acclaimed lowbudget independent film, Twin Falls Idaho 
is yet another example of the fact that.it

Blair Witch as the audience favorite in the

By DOUGLAS JONES, JR.

If you were rubbing your eyes 
last Friday night at the Frame 
because you thought you were 
seeing double, dont worry-your 
eyes are fine. It was merely the 
exhibit of Marinda Stretavskys 
Twins Paintings that had you 
seeing multiple images. 
Stretavsky, an alumna of Carn
egie Mellon Universitys School 
of Art, completed the paintings 
during her junior year at the 
University, and chose as her sub
ject matter the theme of twins.
The artist, a twin herself, has 
painted the development of 
twins throughout childhood, pu
bescence, and young adulthood.
While working on these 
paintings, I started to realize 
that my passion came from 
j knowing that I was a part of this 
very unique relationship, said 
Stretavsky. Without a second 
glance, one notices that twins 
dominate the thematic structure 
of her work. Everything 
Stretavsky created for this ex
hibit had some sort of double 
, image; even her sculptures had 
two heads, one on the front and 
one on the back.
Stretavskys technique, opt
ing for broad strokes rather than 
detail and form, is reminiscent 
of that of an art class in an 
elementary school. It is appar
ent that she is painting faces, 
bodies, or whatever else, but 
there is little attention paid to 
, any sort of technique or form. 
Naturally, it is not important to 
yield to every ideal of the classi
cal artist, who strove for order, 
poise, and serenity. Nor is it 
imperative to acquiesce to all of 
, the ideals of the romantic art
ist, who longed for strangeness,
wonder, and ecstasy. However, 
Stretavskys paintings are 
caught in some sort of limbo 
that is wavering between the 
real and the imaginary. She is, 
however, consistent throughout 
her paintings. Each one, with
out fail, brings to mind that 
elementary art class.
The paintings create an.evo
lutionary world for the twins, 
following them from childhood 
through young adulthood. One 
painting, titled First Commun
ion  1961, depicts four girls 
sitting on a couch getting ready 
to attend their first commun
ion service at church. Each little 
girl is attired with the proper 
white dress as well as prayer 
books. However, what is unique 
about this painting is that the 
hairpieces of the girls are raised 
,from the surface of the canvas. 
Stretavsky uses strips of lace 
to tie each girls hair up.
The final painting in this se
ries is actually two paintings 
entitled Donning our Wings I 
& II. These paintings culmi
nate the twinsjourney because 
it shows them, finally, as inde
pendent. The notable part of 
these paintings is that the two 
girls, although they are sepa
rated, are still identical, not 
only in the face, but in clothing 
and environment.
Even though we [she and her 
twin] have lived apart, almost 
1,500 miles apart, for the last 
20 years, I know that as long as 
I live, she will be a part of me, 
Stretavsky said of the last piece. 
Her memory and the memo
ries I have of us as children, 
teenagers, and young adults are 
very much with me. These 
memories inspire me to create 
images that honor the love we 
both share.
Performer gives insight into quirky world

On Tuesday, September 21, 
the man known as Atom and 
His Package played at the 
Stevenson Theater on 6000 
Penn Circle South at the bor
der of Shady side andEast Lib
erty. The venue was located in 
the depths of an art store. The 
basement was attractively 
decorated, with acrylic paint
ings on brick walls. Atom and 
His Package was the main at
traction that night, playing 
funny pop tunes that sound as 
if they could have come 
straight from the 80s on a 
synthesizer he calls The Pack
age. Everyone rose from their 
lethargic states and their 
chairs to witness the one man / 
one machine act. Atom put on 
an extremely entertaining 
show with much stage banter 
and crowd interaction. He 
brought people from all genres 
of music together for the love 
of humorous pop. Atom has 
grown in popularity in a short 
amount of time and is a true 
phenomenon in the indepen
dent music scene.
Recently, The Tartan had a 
brief discussion with Atom. 
Heres what it looks like in 
Atoms world.
The Tartan: What was your 
favorite cartoon as a kid?
Atom: Our parents didnt let 
us watch cartoons. For some 
reason, my parents were re
ally against cartoons. When
ever I was at a friends house, 
wed watch Starblazers.
IT: Starblazers? Wasnt that 
a show with space horses or 
something like that?
Atom: Well... its like, they
are in a spaceship, and they 
need to get back to earth or 
something. And they have 
horses in space.
TT: You said we. How many 
siblings do you have?
Atom: I have an older brother 
and a younger sister.
TT: What do you imagine they 
think of your music?
Aiom:Ummm ... they are very 
nice and say they like it but....
TT: Do es your family go to 
any of your shows?
Atom: Every once in a while. 
Not very often.
TT: You said you went to Ja
pan over the summer. How was 
the Japanese crowd?
Atom: They were really nice, 
but no one really liked it or knew 
what the hell I was doing.
TT: Do you plan to go back to 
Japan soon?
Atom: I would love to go back 
and visit, but I dont think 
theres any point in going there 
and playing because no one 
knows me.
TT: Maybe in two years?
Atom: Nah ... that would be 
pushing it [laughs]. Everyones 
just like, huh?
TT: On a radio show, Ive heard 
a list of all the genres that are 
played such as: funk, pop-punk, 
hardcore, electronic, and Atom 
and His Package. I dont know 
how to put you into a music 
genre. Can you help me out?
Atom: Wow, Im really im
pressed. I dont know. Im defi
nitely not playing any music 
that provokes reactions like, 
Oh, this is original. It sounds 
like 80s pop music, I guess.
TT: But youre in the 90s.
Atom: Yeah, outdated crap 
would be a good term for it.
TT: Any shows that stand out 
or were really exciting?
Atom: I played a show in 
Greensboro, NC in August. Ap
parently, before I played, some
one took the liberty of making a 
little flyer to pass out to every
body except to me, that said,
meathead jock people.
TT: So what kind of car do 
you drive when you are out on 
the road?
Atom: Ohh man! My moms 
car. Its pretty non-punk. M^
lets make this show fun for parents are really overly sweet*.
Atom. When he says the word 
song, you scream fk you. 
Whenever he says the words 
Greensboro, NC, yell out Go 
home, Yankee.  There were all 
these different things, but I 
didnt know that this was going 
to happen. So when I get up 
there, I said, Hi. This is Atom. 
Im going to play a song, and 
everybody was like Fk you! 
I was like What? Because there 
were eight different things, 
people would be screaming 
at me, and I was thinking, 
what the fk was going 
on?! I seriously thought that 
everyone was being really 
mean to me. I was like, Man,
I dont even want to play 
anymore. I was like, Why 
did you set up this show? 
Just to be mean to me? As it 
turns out, it was planned, 
and I caught on eventually.
TT: I know that you are 
always put with different 
types of music all the time. 
What was the most mis
matched show that you have 
ever played?
Atom: Recently, Ijust played 
a show with two guys named 
TenatiousD.TheyhaveaHBO

guys who play acoustic guitars 
and sing songs. They are appar
ently funny. So, I knew the guy

Hockey film fulfills 
sports fans dreams
By THADDEUS BILLMAN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Mystery Alaska, the new film 
by director Jay Roach (Austin 
Powers), brings to life the dreams 
of1 every devoted sports fan  a 
chance to be a professional star.
The story begins with a typical 
Saturday game in Mystery, 
Alaska. For Mystery, the Satur
day hockey game is everything. 
It is their pride and dignity; no 
one can beat them. Shortly after 
the game, the latest Sports Il
lustrated issue arrives, featur
ing the boys of Mystery.
 Soon the main plot begins to 
develop. Former town resident 
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) 
returns after writing the article 
fot Sports Illustrated. The ar
ticle sparks considerable atten
tion, and the NHL then 
decides it would like to 
set up an exhibition game 
in which Mystery will 
play the New York Rang
ers.
The series of plot 
twists that follow keep 
the viewer guessing and 
add a little depth to the 
! story, as the team will 
have a coach, and the 
town sheriff and 13-year 
Saturday game veteran 
John Bebe will be play
ing again. Finally, the big
Mystery has a lot of strong 
points. The emotion it carries is 
pure and wonderful, highlight
ing the fast-paced hockey scenes. 
The actors give strong perfor
mances, including a cameo ap
pearance by Mike Myers {Austin 
Powers), and the cinematogra
phy is excellent. However, the 
movie does have its shortcom
ings as well. The writing leaves 
something to be desired, and the 
humor is mostly low-class and 
distracting. Primarily, the film 
tries to do too much. Dozens of 
subplots are introduced for no 
apparent reason, and only a few 
go anywhere, many times leav
ing the viewer more confused 
than entertained.
All and all, Mystery is a very 
good film. Its shortcomings are 
minimal in comparison to the

How will it turn out? Well, to find

ideal ending for the movie, and 
by itself is worth the ticket price.
remarkable emotion it displays 
and invokes in the viewer. I

cated comedy.
Promising play falls short of potential
By JENNIFER PETRINI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Ballyhoo is the social event 
that all young southern Jews 
dream about attending. It prom
ises to be a night of bliss, hon
esty, and acceptance for an op
pressed cultural group. But 
Ballyhoo does not really exist in 
Alfred Uhrys Tony Award-winning play. It is merely the real
ization that bigotry can and will 
be a factor between people from 
the same cultural background.
Starlight Productions Pitts
burgh premiere of The Last 
Night of Ballyhoo seemed to 
lack more than a sense of cul
tural freedom. Staged at the 
Stephen Foster Memorial on 
Pitts campus, the play 
struggled to identify the true 
meanings of hidden identity and 
family prejudice.
Set in Atlanta in 1939, on the 
eve of the opening of Gone with 
the Wind, the play opens with a 
well-to-do extended Jewish fam
ily decorating a Christmas tree 
placed right in front of their 
living room window. Right 
away, the family admits to liv
ing in the Christian side of town 
and assimilates into the ac
cepted religion. Yet they are 
ignorant to their own Jewish 
beliefs. It is not until a gentle
man caller asks one of the 
familys rivaling cousins to the 
grand Ballyhoo dance that big
otry in the same faith takes a 
precedent note.
In the same house resides 
Adolph Freitag, the single work
ing man who runs the family 
business. Played by Richard 
Rauh, who delivers humorous 
yet expressionless two-cent 
lines, Adolph shines as the man 
of the house, sharing the home
with his sister Boo Levy, sisterin-law Reba Freitag, and their 
two college-age daughters, Lala 
Levy and Sunny Freitag.
Boo, played by Mary Rawson, 
is a spoiling mother who cares 
more about appearances than 
true identity. Rawson gives a 
feisty attempt as Boo, but strikes 
out as a believable character. Her 
humor is forced and her drive is 
weak, especially when contrasted 
with the ambitious and whiny 
voice of Lala, played by high 
school senior Lydia Burns. WithDecker, is just the opposite of her 
sister-in-law, Boo. Reba is proud 
of her daughter Sunny, who is 
away at school, and shows her 
closely-knit tie to her deceased 
husband. She spends most of her 
time on the couch knitting or 
straightening the doilies on the 
living room furniture, delivering 
her wise cracking anecdotes with 
the spunk of a forgetful older 
woman. However, sometimes 
Decker gives the impression that 
she is really forgetting her lines 
and overstepping them with a
out her daughters constant 
dreams of being a southern belle 
and charming the likes of any 
man, Boo is merely a pushy 
mother who wants her little girl 
to be more than she really is.
Reba Freitag, played by Joan
Reagan Heller/Tartan Junior Staff 
hint of the character she was 
blessed with.
Sunny is the calmer and more 
respected character, who keeps 
her composure and contrasts with 
the quirkiness of her family. 
Tawnya Hladiks portrayal is real.
She defines the real struggles of 
the familys devotion to their 
unpracticed Jewish faith. When 
she is paired up with Joe Farkal 
a Russian Jew from New Yorlt 
City, she balances her hidden 
identity with her inclination to 
be true to herself.
The storys conflict begin 
with Ballyhoo. Lala is search^ 
ing for a date when her eyes 
wind up on her uncles ne\# 
employee, Joe. However, Jo 
becomes intrigued by Sunny and 
asks her to Ballyhoo, leaving 
Lala destined for Peachy 
Weil, a wealthy southern 
Jew, who is spoiled, rudej 
and downright obnoxious. 
Shelby Michael Shannon 
comes off hysterically as 
Peachy, giving his sly, pre
sumptuous, snotty behave 
ior a course of deceitful dig-} 
cord. The romance between 
Sunny and Joe is over-: 
turned, and the real depth 
is then centered on the 
familys prejudice against 
one of their own kind.
The play had potential; 
The set was spectacular, dej 
picting a very wealthy home 
with a split-level dcor. Yet 
the house was built so that 
the acoustics were awfiil 
when the characters spoki 
upstage in the dining roomi 
The hidden message of lost 
identity was hard to find 
until Joes heritage con
flicted with that of Sunnysi 
There was something missjing from Uhrys play that 
left it unfinished and oftelft 
uninteresting. The conflicts 
were there, but they were ndt 
staged to the fullest. Director 
Scott Lee Denier needed to dig 
to find the real friction and not 
worry so much about Ballyhoo.Powerful performance brings Oscar quality to Holocaust film
By GAIL RONEN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Robin Williamss brilliant perfor
mance in Jakob the Liar brings the sort 
of Oscar-caliber quality to the film that 
audience members have grown to expect 
from the actor. Jakob the Liar is a touch
ing and moving film, focusing on the 
, hardships and hopes of those sent to the 
jieath camps during the Holocaust of 
..^Vorld War II.
As a Jewish caf owner who suffers 
along with his friends and neighbors 
under German torture, Jakob Heym
(Williams ) decides that he wants to bring 
hope to the Nazi-occupied town. In order 
to do so, he begins fabricating lies about 
the status of the war. He tells the people 
of the town that he owns a radio with 
which he can hear news of how the war 
is going. Everyone believes his stories of 
Russias advance in the war, and soon 
they all begin to believe that they will be 
set free. Jakob becomes very popular, in 
fact, almost a leader, as everyone flocks 
to hear the information that he suppos
edly knows.
Though it seems at first that what 
Jakob is doing is wrong, it is what the
town needs to hear. His scheme effec
tively brings hope to lives of the people 
who are suffering from senseless hatred. 
As Jakobs stories begin to take effect, and 
people begin to feel that giving up is not 
the only way out, the number of suicides in 
the town goes down. Despite his lies, Jakob 
does the right thing.
Liev Schreiber(Mischa) gives an out
standing performance as a former boxer 
who is determined to help resist the Ger
mans. Hannah Taylor Gordon as Lina, 
the young girl Jakob was hiding from the 
Nazis, also gives a convincingperformance.
The film becomes especially tense when
Jakob makes an attempt to get 
some real news. He sneaks into a German 
bathroom to read the newspapers and is 
almost caught by a German soldier. Also, 
the capture of the professor, another main 
character, and the final scenes of the 
movie will keep you perched on the edge of 
your seat.
Jakob the Liar is perhaps not as bril
liant as the recent film Life Is Beautiful 
or the Oscar-winningiSc/zi^dZers 
List, but it captures the spirit of what it 
was like to live in the ghetto 
during World War II. The plot is 
suspenseful enough to keep the
audience interested.
Although Williams has played a leader 
in previous films, this role differs from his 
past roles; in this one, he does not want to 
be the hero, but he sees the need to bring 
hope to the people. In this film, Williamss 
character does not have the confidence of 
his characters in Dead Poets Society or 
Patch Adams, yet he makes just as big;a 
difference in the lives of the other charac
ters. The Holocaust was a horrible event 
which many would give anyhting to for
get. But this film shows that no matter 
how horrific the circumstance, there is 
always a small ray of hope.

egie Mellon. This years festivities were even better 
due to the outstanding effort put in to attract the big 
alumni names, like actress Judith Light (Whos The 
Boss?), actor Ted Danson (Three Men and A Baby), 
and James Gosling, chief architect of the Java 
programming language. This all culminated with a 
big dinner in the majestic Rangos Ballroom. Presi
dent Cohon and some of the deans are all seated at 
the head table with Light, Danson, and Gosling, the 
guests of honor.
During the dinner, no one notices when clandes
tine agents sporting DKNY ski masks begin taking 
out AB Tech civilians in the back of the ballroom 
with chloroform-soaked bandanas. One by one, each 
of the technicians are taken out with a chlorofoamsoaked rag and dragged into the Peter-McKennaWright Room across the hallway. There, their clothes 
are taken and donned by the villans. None of the 
alumni detect anything amiss when a different set 
of AB workers takes control of the light board.
Then suddenly, the ballroom goes pitch black. 
Everyone screams until the illumination comes 
back j 1 few moments later. However, Cohon, 
Provost- Christiano, Dean Murphy, Light, and 
Danson ar6 all missing! A door slams in the back, 
and several alumni run out after the kidnappers. 
They go down the stairs and outside, almost run
ning into the helicopter which has suddenly ap
peared on the Cut. As soon as witnesses realize that 
the guests of honor are being hoarded onto the 
helicopter, the chopper blades begin whirling, kick
ing up all the dirt and grass seed which has unfor
tunately not grown in time for Homecoming.
While people cover their eyes, Gosling kicks out 
the window pane from the third-floor hallway. He 
sprints out from the windowsill and takes a mighty 
jump. As the helicopter climbs up, he reaches out 
and grabs one of the legs with his right hand, 
bellowing, I will save you, and I will save the face 
of the great university that is Carnegie Mellon! The 
audience can do nothing but wonder what could 
possibly happen next.
Dont miss Homecoming.... Because you dont have 
to come home, but you cant stay here.
Six-String Samurai
Sunday, Septmber 26
Poor Senator Sonny Bono always used to get 
teased because he was a musician who wanted to 
change things about this country. It is unfortunate 
that he chose politics as his weapon. Instead, he 
should have chosen a samurai sword.
Thats precisely what old-school rocker Buddy 
does in this movie. When the United States is nuked 
and taken over by Russia, Buddy heads west to 
dethrone Elvis and become the new king. He, along 
with his orphan sidekick The Kid, fight in a count
less number of battles with his six-string guitar and 
samurai sword on the way to Lost Vegas. Do you see 
the cheesy wordplay? It is not an accident. This 
movie has more cheese and campiness than a rerun 
of The Sonny and Cher Show.

Nine Inch Nails 
The Fragile
It has been quite some time 
since a new release has been as 
eagerly anticipated as Nine Inch 
Nailss new release, The Fragile. 
Die-hard 
fans have 
been waiting 
for years for 
NIN master
mind Trent 
Reznor to 
save rock 
and end the 
reign of the 
Backstreet 
Boys.
Too bad 
the new
record wont even come close. A 
100-minute-plus work of art-rock, 
The Fragile isnt an easy listen 
and doesnt have too many candi
dates for breakout singles. How
ever, its probably the best NIN 
record to date, a complex work 
that rocks harder and digs deeper 
than any album in recent 
memory.
From uhe firs!: track, it's evi
dent that NINs lyrical focus has 
shifted. Somewhat Damaged 
couples a menacing four-note riff 
with a venomous Reznor vocal. 
Yet, unlike in The Downward Spi
ral, his anger is directed not in
ward but toward those who have 
abandoned and betrayed him over 
the past few years. This theme is 
echoed throughout, most notably
in the confused Where is Every
body? and the rapid-fire 
Starfuckers, Inc., a songRezrior 
clearly aims at estranged friend 
Marilyn Manson.
Musically, NIN has broadened 
its horizons, without completely 
abandoning the aggressive 
electrometal of clas
sics like Closer and 
Head Like a Hole. 
Certainly the ambi
tion of the music has 
expanded, given the 
grand, epic sweep of 
the record. Reznor 
hasnt lost his knack 
for head-bobbing 
beats and hummable 
melodies either, as il
lustrated by the mov
ing single Were in 
This Together. The music also 
contributes a good deal to the emo
tional depth of the record. In par
ticular, instrumental tracks like 
the hopeful-sounding Just Like 
You Imagined are more reflec
tive and thoughtful than much of 
Reznors usual bile.
With depressing lyrics and 
songs that sometimes come off as 
simply noisy, Nine Inch Nails isnt 
always the most fun band to lis
ten to. Nevertheless, TheFragile 
is a remarkable work, maintain
ing cohesion and managing to 
avoiding dullness throughout 
the duration of the CD. 
Its an intense, challenging piece 
of art  isnt that what alterna
tive rock is all about?
 ANDY FRANCIS
Tori Amos
to venus and back
Atlantic
Dear God, when I die please 
bring me back as a sultry red
head who makes pianos and reli
gion sexier than two lips 
wrapped around a wet cherry. 
Like every good girl between the 
ages of 15 and 21,1 have sweet, 
sweet Tori stuck between my Sa
rah and Ani records.
She has just released her fifth 
album, to venus and back, a 
double-disc set. It has one CD of 
new music and one CD of Uve 
songs from her last tour. With 
Tori, you can usually count on 
each album to always sound a 
little different, but venus is more 
in the vein of her earlier release 
from the choirgirl Hotel, than it is 
a complete departure, bliss, 
concertina, and glory of the 
80s are oh-so-delicious ex
amples of those layered melo
dies of hers that I love  the 
songs that start out soft and 
slow, then build so her voice 
seems to float and theres this 
lovely sort of echo to it. There 
are other songs, though, like 
jurez, and datura, that 
show another hint of Choirgirl
ish. style: that feedback-y 
fuzziness on her voice that 
seems like shes singing to you 
from your answering machine.
So, what about the live al
bum? Well, Tori fan or not, see
ing her live is an amazing experience. Shes one of the few 
people Ive heard who sounds 
much better live than on the 
stereo. I look at the assortment 
of songs, and I think, What the 
hell? In some ways, its a good 
representation of her live show, 
because she always seems to play 
two or three songs that make ytiu 
say, What the hell? precitius 
things, cornflake girl, aiid 
waitress are songs she alwd^s 
plays, and they sound like th.y 
always do. cruel, bells far 
her, little earthquakes, and 
purple people are nice choices 
to showcase live. True to form, 
she plays slightly different ver
sions of almost all of the songs on 
here. Maybe Im bitter because 
most of my rfa 
vorite songs werent included, or 
maybe Im over her live stuff be
cause I always bootleg her shows.
In either case, the live CD is nice*to 
have, but the new CD is fabulous. 
Buy it! Buy it now!

Momos been out doing her fall 
shopping this week, kiddos. I 
dropped a small fortune at my fa
vorite panty shop, La Fille 
Publique, where I got some beauti
ful crotchless undies, as well as a 
boatload of inspiration. F ashion is 
whats on my mind, so Im serving 
up my usual main course, with a 
side of style.
LIBRA
(September 23-October 23)
Youve found yourself bogged 
down lately by an overwhelming 
amount of responsibilities. Youre 
so backed up, you feel like you need 
an enema. Dont fear, Leebs, con
centrate on getting back to yourself 
with a good old-fashioned shopping 
spree. Its time to max out those 
student credit cards again.
SCORPIO
(October 24-November 21)
Your impeccable taste in cloth
ing unfortunately doesnt extend 
to your taste in people, Scorp. 
When it comes to relationships, 
youre on my 10 worst-dressed 
list. If your mother only knew 
the likes of which you keep com
pany with, she would shit a brick.
You should repent and join a 
church group.
SAGITTARIUS
(.November 22-December 21)
Whenever I think of the early 
90s, Sags, I have visions of you 
sporting brand-new Doc Martens 
and a tom flannel shirt. Fast for
ward to the late 90s: Youre wear
ing the same tired crap. Its time to 
update your look, and this week 
will be the perfect time to do it. Im 
free tomorrow at noon, and lunch is 
on you. 
CAPRICORN
(December 22-January 19)
Focus on letting go of your un
healthy emotional connection with 
your precious mommy and daddy. 
In other words, cut the goddamn 
cord, Cappy. Speaking of cords, go 
get yourself a pair of boot-cut ones 
from the Gap. They will be flatter
ing to your figure. Everybody in 
cords.
AQUARIUS
(January 20-February 18)
You have an undeniable knack 
for lighting up a room with just a 
flash of your smile. If you really 
want to get the party startejd 
though, try flashing something 
else. Take a hint from Momo  a 
little nipple goes a long way. For 
easy access, try something small 
and stretchy.
PISCES
(February 19-March 20)
Rarely before have beauty, 
brains, and talent been served up
in such enerous helpings, Pisces. 
Unfortunately, Im not referring to 
you, but to the irascible Esther Rolle 
of Good Times fame. Take some tips 
for our beloved Florida, and get 
yourself some turtleneck sweaters 
in luscious autumn colors.
ARIES
(March 21-April 19)
Youve been wondering lately 
whether your inner child will ever 
leave you alone. Stop coddling that 
spoiledbrat. Take acue fromMomo. 
If you really want relief from your 
current state of mind, slip into some
thing sexy and forget your childish 
preoccupations. Ive found that 
theres nothing better than a grown 
woman in a see-through thong to 
. scare off a nosy kid.
TAURUS
(April 20-May 20)
Be forewarned, Taurie, youre 
putting yourself at risk with your 
foolish displays. In the unlikely 
event that you ever become famous, 
those pictures from last weekend 
will certainly come back to haunt 
you. Do you really want to become 
fodder for the campus rumor mill? 
My more immediate concern, 
though, is reserved for your for
merly pristine mohair sweater and 
that poor defenseless goat.
GEMINI
(May 21-Jne 21)
Gemmie, no one everseems to 
appreciate you, do they? Youre not 
only shunned in social situations, 
but everywhere else as well. Dont 
be so hard on yourself, your ideas
and feelings are valid. Just learito 
keep them to yourself. To relieve 
the inner torment, start a hew 
hobby, like knittingperhaps. Momo 
needs a new macram bikini for her 
trip to Rio in November.
CANCER
(June 22-July 22)
You are on a collision course 
with scholastic burnout. Its high 
time you realized that youre riot 
cut out for this pace. Considr 
cashing in your tuition money ftd 
living the good life for a few weks. 
What Im saying is its time'to 
abandon ship, but dont forget your 
safety vest. Everybody in vests.
LEO
(July 23-August 22)
Stop asking what the cost of 
living is, and start asking what 
the cost of loving is. Its easy to gt 
caught up in career-planning fejrvor, but chill out for a second. 
Youre never going to get any
where in life just looking at ttye 
bottom line. Speaking of looking 
at your bottom line, try a threeway mirror  those pants seem a 
bit tight on you.
VIRGO
(August 23-September 22) ;
Your recent concern for the well
being of animals is getting out ;of 
hand, Virgo. That whole rap ws 
cool for a few years, but its turned 
into a very tired excuse for a life. 
Lose the hemp and canvas clut
ter, and get back to basics with a 
head-to-toe leather ensemble. 
Everybody in leather.

Bar codes. I see them everywhere. Bar 
codes on my mug, on my milk, on every
thing I own. Bar codes are the main reason 
a product is sold. Not really, but let's just 
assume that is the reason. Bar codes on 
my Van shoes. Maybe when I do my next 
painting, 1 will put my own bar code on it. I 
imagine in 40 years everyone will have a bar 
code somewhere, maybe on their hand or 
forehead. The bar code will give specific 
information about the person. It will be so 
much easier to catch criminals. Each per
son will even pay for their groceries with the 
bar code on their palm. But life will lack 
suspense and mystery. Peoples personali
ties will be lost. I think bar codes have 
come a long way, but they could go further.
I walk into the store to buy a gallon of milk 
and a package of chocolate chip cookies. 
An old lady stands in front of me. She is all 
alone by herself, and she is doing some

Hello sir. That is $6.78. Would you
