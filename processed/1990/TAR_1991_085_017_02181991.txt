CMU engages 
in war research
|gy farron w.levy
fartcm Contributing Editor
The war in the Persian Gulf affects many 
Carnegie Mellon students. Some have 
friends or family serving in the armed 
forces. Many fear the re-institution of a 
draft. But some students are helping out 
the war effort a little more directly  by 
developing weapons systems for the mili
tary, perhaps even against their will.
There is no question that some of the 
work done by Carnegie Mellon has been 
utilized by the military for weapon sys
tems, said Carnegie Mellon Provost AnJordan. CMU, along with MIT and 
Stanford, he said, are the three biggest 
schools in computer science and since 
I960 have received a lot of funding for 
research in artificial intelligence problems, 
hardware, robotics, etc.
Some find CMUs involvement with the 
military unacceptable, for a variety of 
reasons. However, according to a CMU 
student who worked on a military project 
for the Robotics Institute over last summer, 
few seem to understand the true facts. 
This, he said, is a big problem.
I felt pretty upset about it because of 
what [part I played], the student said. 
The student had been working for the 
Robotics Institute for a while, when with
out forewarning, the project was forced
upon us  no one was happy about it. 
The students disgruntlement stems from 
the fact that, I wasnt told ahead of time 
what I was doing because I probably 
wouldnt have done it if I had known ahead 
of time.
The project, according to the student, 
involved the militarys Time Phase Forced 
Deployment scheduler which manages the 
data for all existing troops and equipment 
and creates a timetable of where and when 
they have to be at certain times for each 
campaign.
The student recalled that the nature of 
the project became apparent quickly. The 
first day [of the project] we had a meeting 
and I was given a stack of classified mili
tary manuals to read up on.
Apparently, the militarys previous 
scheduler couldnt handle the data load 
produced by the war in the Gulf. By 
September, the military was just [calcu
lating it] by hand because they couldnt 
use the computers, said the student.
The CMU team was charged with cre
ating a new system to handle the current 
crisis. The resulting system, according to 
the student, was a million times better. 
Its easier to see the data and it uses 
graphs. Its also easier to use, it has a lot 
nicer interface, it runs faster, and it looks 
better.

At its meeting on February 13, 
Student Senate defeated one 
resolution concerning the crisis 
in the Persian Gulf, and passed 
another with amendments. Both 
resolutions dealt with support of 
various issues involving the war 
 one with a war teach-in at
Senate considered these issues 
to be political views, said Senate 
Public Relations Chair Colin 
Crehan. We felt that we could 
not support views that the campus 
in general might not support. 
The resolutions, while they al
most totally opposed each other, 
were both treated the same way. 
According to Crehan, Both reso
lutions were brought up and de
based
on support of a teach-in being 
held at Pitt next Wednesday. The 
resolution was in five parts, and 
was defeated on the first vote.
After a lot of debate, according 
to Crehan, the resolution Was 
amended and finally passed. The 
final version says that Student
Senate:
Recognizes that campus-level 
forums for debate and the presen
tation of alternative views are 
crucial elements of education for 
those in the campus community 
who want to reach considered 
opinions, and;
Calls upon Faculty Senate to 
debate a resolution similar to this 
one.
We felt that since the teach-in 
had not happened, we could not
support it, said Crehan. We felt 
that if the teach-in was biased, we 
would be sending the wrong mes
sage.
The second resolution was de
feated as well, by a vote of 11 to 2.; 
It stated, We, the students of

President for Development David

with the understanding that it was 
the best thing for both him and

[Merrick] and I had been talking 
over the last four months or so, and

Maloney. After several recent talks, 
we decided that he was not com
fortable with his management style 
in this environment.
I feel very good about it, said 
Merrick. [This is] something
[Maloney] and I discussed from the 
beginning ... we gave it a try to
gether.
It was ... in the best interests of 
my career and the Alumni Asociation 
to make this decision early on, said 
Merrick. Im very positive about 
the situation.
Merrick was just not the right 
fit, according to Maloney. To be a 
competent manager, one must be 
comfortable with [his/her] own 
management style, and [Merrick] 
wasnt comfortable with the way his 
style fit in here.
This became clear to the both of 
us over the time he spent here, 
Maloney added.
Merrick came to Carnegie Mellon 
after spending time at both Bethany 
College and Chapman College as

Student Senate moves 
to fill empty positions

Special to The Tartan
After the recent retake of the 
fall elections, six seats on Student 
Senate remain unfilled.
At this point, there are three 
vacant seats in the School of Ur
ban and Public Affairs, two in the 
Colege of Fine Arts, and one in 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech

There are two main reasons that
Senate seats are left open: either 
Senators resign from office or no 
votes are cast for the seat.
Colin Crehan, Student Senate 
publicrelations chair, commented 
that he believed that the CFA and 
CIT openings occurred because 
those three Senators decided to 
resign after serving only one of 
the two semesters of their elected 
terms.
CFA Senator Amy Blake said 
that in the case of one CFA open

Senators introduce excess oil profit tax
WASHINGTON (DJ)  Three 
Senators have revisited the idea 
of an excess oil profits tax, fol
lowing through on complaints 
from their constituents about high 
gasoline prices, coupled with 
fourth-quarter earnings gains by 
some oil companies.
tyith the Bush administration 
indicating that it wants to move 
forward with energy legislation, 
a host of lawmakers have begun 
putting their views into bills in 
the hopes that they can be factored 
into a final energy plan.
But some of the proposals, such 
as the excess profits tax, steer far 
clear of anything the administra
tion has said it would consider. 
Wednesday, Bush and his Coun
cil of Economic Advisors released 
a report calling for increased 
flexibility in the marketplace and 
advocating a continuation of the 
nations successful policy of mar
Another proposal would establish a 
mechanism to deal with oil emergen
cies through stricter regulations on 
the allocation and pricing of oil.
ket reliance.
Other proposals introduced this 
session include stricter regula
tions on oil companies during 
energy emergencies, another 10- 
cents-a-gallon gasoline tax and 
conservation and efficiency mea
sures that cross over the line the 
administration seems to have 
drawn on those matters.
The excess oil profits bill, co
sponsored by Senators Joseph 
Lieberman (D-Conn.), Howard 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), and Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine), would 
force large oil companies to pay a
surtax on their after-tax profits 
equal to 40 percent of the amount 
exceeding their average net cor
porate profit for the five preced
ing tax years.
Although this proposal would 
run counter to the administra
tions opposition to market inter
ference, more legislators have 
supported a tax to punish com
panies for profiting this way.
The tax proposed by the three 
Senators would apply only to large 
oil companies, defined as those 
that control one percent or more 
of either the production, the re
serves, the refining capacity or 
the sale of petroleum or petro
leum products. Proceeds would go 
toward deficit reduction.
Another proposal likely to face 
opposition from the administra
tion, as well as from a number of 
legislators, would establish a 
mechanism to deal with oil emer
gencies through stricter regula
tions on the allocation and pricing 
of oil. Rep. Norman Mineta (DCalif. ) introduced a bill that would 
require the President to set up a 
standby program to be enacted 
during supply shortages, threats 
of shortage, or anticipatory mar
ket panic.
Minetas proposal would require 
refiners to share oil during 
presidentially declared emergen
cies and would charge penalties 
of up to $500,000 for violations of 
the regulations, preempting any 
applicable state laws for the du
ration ofthe emergency. The Bush 
administration wouldnt be likely 
to use such a mechanism, espe
cially to intervene with the pric
ing of oil. But opponents of the bill 
would be more concerned that 
future administrations might be 
more inclined to react to com
plaints from consumers about 
skyrocketing prices.
Representative Bill Green (RNew York) proposed imposing an 
additional 10-cents-a-gallon tax 
to help fund mass transit pro
grams, to reduce the deficit and 
gasoline consumption. It would 
also make the five-cents-a-gallon 
tax included in last years deficit 
reduction agreement permanent. 
The five-cent tax would otherwise 
expire four years from now.
A wide array of energy efficiency 
bills have been introduced to both 
the House and Senate. There 
seems to be wide support for
greater efficiency in federal 
buildings and in federal motor 
vehicle fleets, although there isnt 
a wide consensus on how to 
achieve that efficiency.
One proposal from the Bush 
administration would be to re
quire that all replacement fleet 
vehicles produced after 1993 be 
able to run on alternative fuels 
according to Senate Energy Com
mittee Chairman J. Bennett 
Johnston (D-La.).
A Congressional proposal that 
reportedly wont be included in 
the Bush plan would repeal the 
tax on utility rebates.
The Bush plan is expected to be 
sent to Congress within the next 
couple of weeks, after which leg
islators will be expected to final
ize an energy bill. It is highly 
unlikely that the original Bush 
proposal will emerge from Con
gress unchanged.
Death of civilians worries military
DHAHRAN (DJ)  A senior U.S. military 
source in Saudi Arabia, reacting sharply to 
ongoing controversy over the death of Iraqi 
civilians in a air attack on what the United 
States insists was an Iraqi command and 
control facility, said it was totally illogical 
for the Iraqis to shelter civilians in command 
and control facilities.
At the same time, the source acknowledged 
that the so-called shelter bombing incident 
will complicate allied efforts to target and 
retarget Iraqi command and control facilities 
for attack from the air.
The extent to which the incident will com
plicate life for the allies in the Arab world 
remains to be seen, but there seems to be 
what one diplomat called considerable 
downside potential.
Its totally illogical, a military source said
of Iraqi civilians being at a command and 
control site. I cant imagine anyone doing it. 
He said that, its not Saddams style to open 
up his command and control areas to civilians. 
I dont understand how anyone with any 
concern for civilian life would put them in 
harms way, he said.
Asked if he cared to spell out precisely what 
he was intimating, this source snapped, Draw 
your own conclusions.
This was a military facility and we had no 
reason to believe that the Iraqi government 
would use it to house civilians, said a military 
source.
Another source here earlier described Gen. 
Norman Schwarzkopf as very much concerned 
by the incident, and perplexed at how Iraqi 
military leaders could endanger the lives of 
civilians.
Despite the official insistence that the facil
ity housed a military command and control 
operation and suggestions that the Iraqi mili
tary leadership willfully endangered civilian 
lives and intimations that they might have 
done it on purpose, the incident is seen here as 
posing a serious problem for a U.S. Central 
Command that repeatedly has emphasized 
the extent to which it has gone to avoid causing 
civilian targets.
Predictions have been surprisingly com
monplace among western diplomats in Saudi 
Arabia that the United States will face in
creasing enmity in the Middle East as the 
extent of the damage inflicted upon Iraq, its 
armed forces and its civilian population be
comes more apparent to the world. The shel
ter bombing incident is expected to speed this 
process along.Jobless claims suggest stabilizing economy
NEW YORK (D J)  Initial job
less claims rose less than some 
economists expected in the latest 
week, offering the small hope that 
the U.S. economy could be begin
ning to stabilize.
Initial claims for state unem
ployment insurance rose 39,000 
in the week ended February 2 to
456,000, following a 68,000 de
cline in the previous week. The 
total still remains far below the 
recent peak of515,000 in the week 
ending December 22.
Marilyn Schaja, money market 
economist at Donaldson Lufkin
& Jenrette Securities Corpora
tion, says she had been expecting 
a somewhat larger increase in the 
latest week, due, in part, to a 
holiday in the previous week that 
may have resulted in fewer claims 
being filed.
While the latest weeks increase 
was less than expected and is well 
below the December peak, Schaja 
says, Its still a very high level 
for initial claims. (But) it may 
mean things are not deteriorating 
further.
Anthony Karydakis, senior fi
nancial economist at First Chi
cago National Bank, says the lat
est report didnt yield a confirma
tion of continued deterioration 
that some in the bond market had 
been expecting.
Jobless claims in recent weeks 
dont seem to be telling us labor 
market conditions are deterio
rating, says Karydakis. Still, he 
adds, The economy remains in 
very bad shape, but that there 
seems to be a discrepancy between 
the initial claims report and other 
anecdotal evidence such as layoffs.
Analysts tend not to read a great 
deal into the initial claims re
ports, saying the correlation be
tween employment and initial 
claims is loose at best.
But Donaldson Lufkin & 
Jenrettes Schaja says, It does 
seem like the economy is begin
ning to stabilize. She says, too, 
that the economy may have a long 
way to go before it begins to re
cover and, as a result, she wouldnt 
be surprised to see initial claims 
for unemployment insurance rise 
to the 500,000 level or higher.

Bush calls Iraqi 
proposal 'hoax
NEW YORK (DJ)  Presi
dent Bush called Iraqs offer 
for a cease-fire a cruel hoax 
and called on the Iraqi military 
and people. He told them to 
stand and take matters in 
their own hands to force the 
dictator Saddam Hussein to 
step aside.
The president said the pro
posal issued Friday by Iraqs 
Revolutionary Command 
Council was full of unaccept
able old conditions. He added 
that Saddam Hussein has 
added unacceptable new con
ditions.
Bush thought the cele
bratory atmosphere in 
Baghdad showed the Iraqi 
peoples desire to see the war 
end, a war the people of Iraq 
never sought.
President Bush said the Iraqi 
proposal was a cruel hoax 
perpetrated against all the 
Iraqi people. He noted he was 
pleased when he first heard 
about the offer, but added that, 
on closer examination, it re
grettably contained no new el
ements.
Iraq must withdraw with
out condition," Bush said.
There must be full implemen
tation of all Security Council 
resolutions. There must be no 
linkage with other problems in 
the area. They must withdraw 
[from Kuwait.]
President Bush said that un
til there were signs of visible 
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from 
Kuwait, the U.S. and other 
countries will continue efforts 
to force compliance with all of 
the Security Council resolu
tions.
We will continue and pursue 
our objectives with honor and 
decency, he said.
The Iraqi military and people 
can take matters in their own 
hands to force Saddam to step 
aside and to comply with the 
U.N. resolutions and rejoin the 
family of peace-loving nations, 
Bush said.
We have no argument with 
the people of Iraq. Our differ
ences are with Iraqis brutal 
dictator, said Bush.
Bush said he feels sorry for 
the people of Iraq, and for fami
lies in this country whose hopes 
have been dashed by the condi
tions contained in the Iraqi 
statement.

students, giving advice to the school, 
serving on committees of the institution, 
providingjob opportunities for graduates,
and financial donations they make to the 
school.
His plans helped form SARC overthe 
past year, as well as increase alumni 
involvement in other ways.
Im sorry to see him go, said Maloney. 
It was a mutual decision, though. ->

At this time, CMU Recycling is taking brown, clear and green 
glass. Wash them, and remove any lids and metal rings left on 
the bottles. Separate all glass by color. Any labels may remain 
on the bottles.
Newsprint
The western Penn, market for newsprint is anything but 
stable. The problem is the lack of deinking facilities in this area.

$1.6 million given for lab fix
up in Chemistry Department
Carnegie Mellon University has recieved a $1.6 million grant 
from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to renovate faculty 
research labs in the Department of Chemistry. The grant is 
allocated over three years.
The grant is part of the NSFs Academic Research Facilities 
Modernization Program, established by Congress in 1988 to 
upgrade science and research facilities around the country. 
Carnegie Mellon is one of 78 institutions chosen to receive 
awards this year.
The University will match the NSF grant money with an 
additional $1.6 million.
According to Guy Berry, head of the Chemistry Department, . 
the renovations will take place in seven laboratories in Mellon 
Institute. Scientists using these laboratories focus on research, in 
synthetic, theoretical, and physical chemistry, with particular. 
emphasis on biochemistry and materials chemistry.
The award will create state-of-the-art working space for 30 - 
graduate students in these laboratories, said Berry. We neecj  
upgraded facilities to be successful in our work, attract graduate 
students, and assure our future success in the research arena..

Baghdad.
The debate surrounding that 
resolution made it sound very
pro-war, and I dont think it 
was meant that way, said 
Crehan. Again, we didnt want 
to take a political stance.
The resolution expresses no 
opinion on the rightness of the 
war, said Senator Stewart 
Barnes in a letter.
Senate had debated the reso
lutions for some amount of time 
before finally voting them down.

Carnegie Mellon participates in military research
RESEARCH, from page 1
However, from the standpoint 
0f those opposed to the war, the 
teams programming accomplish
ment was not a good thing. The 
Department of Defense (DoD) 
looked at three different systems, 
completed by three different in
stitutions, and liked CMITs the 
best. The system has since been 
fine-tuned and integrated into 
current military use.
While this student pointed out 
that not all research on campus is 
military-oriented, the concern 
remains that people should be 
aware of what goes on.

According to Jordan, the DoD 
funds an extensive and diverse 
amount of research throughout 
the University. One of the most 
visible signs of this is SEI, which 
is actually a semi-autonomous 
division of CMU which is com
pletely funded by the DoD.
The function of SEI, said Jor
dan, is to research software 
technology as well as technology 
transfer  which is the maxi
mization of technology that al
ready exists so that it may be 
used more effectively by corpo
rations, universities, etc.
However, he pointed out,
SEI doesnt do mission-oriented 
research. Contractors of the gov
ernment, like Boeing, that do 
weapons-related researchthey 
do mission-oriented research. 
SEI and other CMU departments 
are funded for basic research, and 
it is other companies that would 
utilize that research in projects, 
according to Jordan. Whether its 
good or bad isnt the issue, he 
said. CMU isnt equipped for 
mission-oriented research.

Guziewicz pointed out that, for 
example, research could develop 
a computer chip, and that chip 
could be used in a Mac or an 
IBM, or any other computer, the 
point being that the final use of 
the research is not a consideration.

Naval Research funds basic re
search in material science, phys
ics, electrical engineering, and 
some computer science. The Air 
Force Office of Scientific Research 
has for many years, according to 
Jordan, used the University for 
similar research.
Two other major government 
agencies with interests in CMU 
are the Army Research Office, for 
basic research, and the Defense 
Alliance Research Project Agency 
(DARPA), which has funded many 
basic projects in computer science 
and materials science.
Furthermore, said Jordan, the
Department of Psychology has 
also received funding from the 
DoD, for research in cognitive sci
ence.
As innocuous as much of the 
research that goes on at CMU is, 
or at least seems to be, some of it 
definitely finds direct application 
with the military. From less vis
ible contributions in psychology 
and physics to its more obvious 
manifestations, such as the arti
ficial intelligence that has been 
incorporated into intelligent 
weapons, Carnegie Mellon is 
definitely not insulated from the 
war in the Gulf.

FORUM
Show your face, Mr. President
The personal touch. For any 
leader, its key. And it can go a 
long way.
.Take President Robert Mehrabian. Besides occasional memos 
to the University community, his 
Contact with the students in his 
first year in office has been vir
tually nonexistent  until last 
Wednesday night, when he at
tended a get-acquainted session 
in Morewood Gardens.
Organized by the Housing Of
fice, the purpose of the program 
was to informally introduce Me
hrabian to some students, and vice 
versa.
We think the program was a 
great idea, but were sorry that it 
didnt happen sooner. And wed 
like to see it happen more often.
An informal environment like 
the Morewood Gardens A-Tower 
lounge is perfect for a simple onceor-twice-a-semester chat with 
some students. Thats all it takes 
io attach a face to a memo.
Former President Richard Cyert 
understood the value of accessi
bility and visibility. Occasional
fireside chats with students and 
a State of the University Address 
every year are two examples of 
the ways he made himself visible 
around campus.
Also, Cyert had office hours once 
a month, a practice that Mehrabian has continued. We under
stand the importance of hierar
chy and going to the right person
 we dont suggest side-stepping 
a professor or a deem when you 
have a problem. We also dont 
mean to convert the presidents 
office into Grand Central Station 
once a month.
As long as it doesnt get out of 
hand, this is an excellent way to 
familiarize Mehrabian and the 
students with each other. Last 
semester, Mehrabian publicized 
his office hours in The Tartans 
University Calendar. Take ad
vantage of them.
The turnout in Morewood Gar
dens to meet with Mehrabian was 
large, so we know the students 
have interest. Thats the 
presidents cue. He has to take it 
from here.
Dont miss last lecturers wisdom
Occasionally, someone comes up 
with an idea so elegant that you 
Wonder why nobody thought of it 
Ipefore.
Such is the case with Katie 
Stannards Last Lecture Series, 
one of the most innovative pro
grams to grace this campus in 
recent memory.
'J'he idea is to get faculty mem
bers to give a lecture as if it were 
their last. The series strength lies 
in its open-endedness; it inher
ently recognizes that some of the 
most profound bits of wisdom 
wont come up in the normal course 
of departmentalized academic 
pursuit.
Fittingly, the last lecturers are 
Carnegie Mellons true all-stars. 
The series began with History 
Department Head Peter Stearns 
pn February 7, and continues to
day with Indira Nair of Engineer
ing and Public Policy, 
i Future lecturers will be Ted 
Fenton, co-director of the Univer
sity Teaching Center (March 7); 
Biology Department Head Susan 
Henry (March 18); and Nobel lau
reate and University Professor 
Herbert Simon (April 9).
With the exception of Simons 
talk, all the Last Lectures will be 
held at 4:30 pm in the Adamson 
Wing. Simon will speak at 5 pm in 
the Wherrett Room.
Stannard, serving her first year 
as an assistant to the dean in the 
Student Affairs office, deserves 
kudos for the series, which she 
transplanted from her alma ma
ter, Carleton College. Not only 
was the idea exceptional, but the 
execution has been outstanding, 
too; the Last Lectures have been 
extremely well advertised.
The topic of Nairs Last Lecture 
is Live the Questions Now. Catch 
it today at 4:30 pm in the Adamson 
Wing  and mark your calendar 
now for the rest of the lectures. 
This is one lecture series not to

Weve gotten some questions 
recently from our readers about 
the function of The Tartans Fo

clear up some misconceptions.
The Forum pages are our way of 
fostering free speech, so we try to 
prbvide a spectrum of opinions to 
allow you, our readers, to be the 
judges.
Y oull find three types of written 
pieces on these pages:

those of the author and not of The 
Tartan. All letters are subject to 
editing for size and grammar, but 
never for content.
Of course, we reserve the right 
to reject letters we feel are libel
ous, obscene, or incoherent. But 
well be glad to discuss any letter 
with the author and see if we cant 
reach a compromise.
While we are willing to withhold 
names from letters to the editor, 
our editor-in-chief does need to 
know who wrote them. Please, 
dont send us anonymous letters,

They are unsigned because they 
represent a consensus opinion of 
The Tartans editorial board. Our 
names can be found in the outside 
column of the opposite page.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen
tary, please feel free to disagree

viduals who are usually members 
of the University community. We 
also carry syndicated columnists. 
Opinions in columns are those of 
the columnists and not of The

agree with them.
In addition to written pieces, we 
run sditmkial caktmmns. When 
accompanying editorials, these 
cartoons also reflect the opinion of 
the editorial board. Otherwise, 
they reflect the opinion of the art

We hope this clears up any 
questions you had about the Fo
rum section.
editmk:
At the Senate meet
ing on February 13, 
after an hour of spir
ited debate over 
Senates role in the 
anti-war effort, I introduced the follow
ing resolution:
We, the students of Carnegie Mellon, 
wish to express our full support for our 
troops in the Middle East. We wish them 
a safe and speedy return, and we express 
our condolences for those who lose their 
lives in the conflict.
This resolution expresses no opinion 
on the rightness of the war. It is similar 
to the pronouncements of several of the 
large national anti-war organizations. 
Yet Senate voted 11 to 2 against adopt
ing the resolution.
Senators Altmann, Austin, Dautermann, Dean, Deross, Gelman, Loofbourrow, Loomis, Mueller, Strong, and 
Wyatt expressed many different reasons 
why they opposed expressing support for 
our troops. A few stated their opposition 
to the content of the resolution  one 
Senator objected to calling for their safe 
and speedy return, saying this could be 
interpreted as support for the U.S. to 
nuke Baghdad.
Fellow students, these areyour elected 
representatives. I cannot believe that

Forbes Gallery shouldnt 
be compromised
Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
editmk:
The following is an 
excerpt from last 
weeks issue [Crime 
and Incident Report, 2/
11]: 2/5 EXCESSIVE 
NOISE, 6:06 am. Aloud hammering noise 
was reported coming from Forbes Gal
lery around 1:06 am. After being asked, 
the students agreed to stop until later. 
CMU Police left the scene.
At 6 am, Campus Police received a 
second complaint. In response to the 
second complaint, the students said that 
they had to get their works up this 
morning. Police advised them that it was 
too early for that amount of noise. They 
were told that any more noise would 
result in a citation.
I think its absolutely ludicrous that 
these people were threatened with a ci
tation last week for putting up their 
show at the Forbes Gallery. Thats what 
galleries are for, after all. It is bad 
planning on the Universitys part that a 
public gallery coexists in the same build
ing as student housing, and there is no
reason why the students should accept 
any responsibility or blame for using a 
space as it was intended to be used. It 
shouldnt matter if they happen to be 
working in the middle of the night. Art
ists have only two days to hang their 
shows, so it is not unreasonable to work 
around the clock until completion.
I wouldnt be quite so upset if the same 
thing hadnt happened to me last semes
ter. But in my case security came on a 
Saturday afternoon during a sound per
formance, and in front of an audience of 
around twenty people told us we would 
have to shut down or we would be cited. 
It is neither securitys fault nor the 
Woodlawn residents fault that these 
conflicts occur. The fault lies in having a 
gallery in a residential building.
I can see two possible solutions to this 
problem: 1) Move the Forbes Gallery to a 
location that is equally visible and acces
sible to both the University and the out
side community, where it wont interfere 
with anyones domestic life, or 2) turn 
the apartment above the gallery into 
something other than living quarters, 
like a recreational room or an 
organizations office. Regularly sending 
Campus Security over to harass the 
people using the space is not a solution.
The Forbes Gallery is an important 
showcase for student work, concerts, and 
performances. None of this should ever 
have to be compromised. I hope that 
every effort will be made to resolve this 
problem quickly and effectively.

Politically Correct 
Universe offers apology
Vo
Letter to 
the Editor
without a penis, we had intended to use 
the equally odd phrase, gender without a 
vagina, when referring to men in the 
follow-up strip. It should be in this weeks 
paper.
In short, we have no personal vendetta. 
We hold no malice against those we sati
rize. And simply because we choose to 
laugh at the difficulties of the world does 
not necessarily mean that we are running 
away from them.
However, we certainly wouldnt want to 
tell you what to think. Make your own 
decisions about the world.
And let us make ours.

Bravo! Writing majors

We would like to offer 
our sincere apology for 
including Jessica Kap
lans name under the 
title of womyn in our 
comic strip [Politically Correct Universe, 
2/4]. We treated Ms. Kaplan as we would 
a public figure when we wrote the strip, 
and did not carefully think the situation 
out before submitting the finished prod
uct. However, expressing our regret for 
the implications we madehumorous in 
intent  regarding Ms. Kaplan is the 
main point.
Additionally, we would like to clear up 
the fog surrounding our motivations in 
produdngPolitically Correct Universe. The 
strip is meant to be satirical in nature. The 
3 Types of Women strip was meant to be 
a satirical representation of three of the 
ways that women are perceived by our 
society. We felt that these representations 
were so sarcastic and overdone that no one 
would take us seriously, and thus they 
would be able to put the commentary in 
perspective for what it was.
As to the Ellen James reference, we 
were referring to the Ellen Jamesians as 
portrayedin The World According to Garp. 
The Ellen Jamesians are a group of femi
nists that cut their own tongues out to 
protest Ellen James rape. We find this 
behavior akin to committing suicide to 
protest a particularly unjust murder. We 
did not, nor will we ever, satirize rape. We 
will, however, reserve the right to poke 
fun at idiocy, even if it is related to an 
extremely sensitive issue.

well rewarded for their talents, but I am 
impressed by what no small number of our 
writing majors are doing now.
Without pay, without course credit, 
and at their own time and expense, many 
of our writing majors are volunteering 
their time to work with elementary school 
children at Colfax Public School. Our 
soon-to-be professionals sit one-on-one 
with children who have a variety of 
learning problems.
Indirectly, I believe that our students 
also give these children the message 
that someone cares enough about them 
to take time out and help  a gesture 
thatmany never receive athome. Ibelieve 
that our English majors have 
themselves well about the importance of 
giving something back to society; I con
sider their response to be a part of what 
the humanities is all about.
These unselfish individuals will be re
warded in the enduring memories of these

that, in this case, their hearts really are

Harassment undermines free speech
Thomas M. Kerr
Regrettably, our cmu.market 
bboard last week displayed some 
messages tastelessly insulting 
s0me particularly specified racial, 
national, or ethnic minorities. 
Some of our minority students  
and some others  were over
whelmingly offended.
Also, those who posted these 
messages added their own par
ticular wisdomthat it was okay 
to say such things since we have 
freedom of speech.
Not so. There can be civil dam
age actions for libel, invasion of 
privacy, or intentional infliction 
of emotional distress. There can
be substantial punitive damages.
A few narrow categories of 
content are excluded from free 
speech and press protection. 
Among them are epithets, offen
sive, derisive, or annoying words 
addressed to other persons in a 
public place.
But suppose those freedoms in
clude rights to gratuitously ha
rass, to insult, to harm others.
Freedom of speech and freedom 
of press are precious rights. They 
should not be abused or prosti
tuted. They shouldbe appreciated. 
They should be cared for. They 
require us to enjoy their oppor
tunities responsibly.
Freedom of expression serves in
dividuals as well as social values. 
An individuals right to fulfillment
No moral philosophy supports con
duct intended to harm other persons> 
brutalizing their personal dignity....
includes a right to express, to 
publish, and to receive information. 
Besides providing for the fulfill
ment of individuals, freedom of 
expression serves the utilitarian 
purpose of promoting vigorous de
bate. From this debate, society 
derives many benefits, including a 
better chance of approaching the 
truth, more participation in gov
ernance, checks on government 
wrongdoing, and orderly change.
It is shocking that anyone would
carelessly tamper with so pre
cious a societal instrument. No 
moral philosophy supports con
duct intended to harm other per
sons, brutalizing their personal 
dignity and self-respect.
Our past teaches us that there 
have been economics for human 
slavery (and poverty), religious 
inquisitions, racial holocausts.
The present causes us to shud
der that the hatred of other groups 
escalates to violence in Northern
Ireland, Beirut, India, Iran, South 
Africa, and throughout the world.
No one should practice these 
atrocities anywhere, including 
academic surroundings.
Perhaps we should have a re
quired course in tolerance, in 
having mutual understanding in 
a pluralistic society.
President Robert Mehrabian 
published on February 7, 1991, 
an excellent Policy Against 
Sexual Harassment. It would be 
entirely fitting for all of us to 
observe and apply its provisions 
to instances of racial or ethnic 
harassment as well.

IFCs Ireland can learn from Pitt brother
Howdy Pierce
Through a happy twist of fate for SAE, 
brothers hold the positions of Inter-fratemity Council president at both Carnegie 
Mellon and Pitt. That major leadership 
coup for the fraternity makes an interesting 
juxtaposition for the rest of us.
As recent events have shown, all SAEs 
are not endowed with equal leadership 
talents  much to Carnegie Mellons loss.
Two weeks ago, Pitts SAE chapter in
stituted a policy of bring-your-own-bottle 
for all its parties to help cut the liability 
risk the house faces every time someone 
takes a drink at a social event.
Speaking in his capacity as IFC presi
dent, Pitts Darin McMullen was upbeat 
about the policy change. It went a lot 
better for us than anyone thought it was 
going to, he told Tartan reporter Jason 
McDonald,and people still seemed to have 
the same amount of general fun.
Our IFC leader was more skeptical. If
one house were to go BYOB [at CMU], 
Matt Ireland told The Tartan, it could 
really be its downfall  social suicide, if 
you will. If one house starts doing some
thing totally different from the other 
houses, then theyre going to be the ones 
ousted from the social scene.
Now, from what I understand, a lot of 
people, independents and Greeks alike, 
cringed when they read Irelands unfor
tunate response. Certainly he didnt mean 
to imply that the reputation of a fraternity 
house rests on the quality of its parties. 
And surely, he didnt intend to say that 
those parties cannot be successful without 
huge quantities of freely-flowing alcohol 
coming from kegs paid for by the house.
Indeed, the informed feeling on the Quad, 
Im told, is that Ireland didnt think before 
he spoke, nor did he mean what he said. It 
seems Ireland has been outspoken in pri
vate meetings on that side of Forbes, trying 
to get Carnegie Mellons Greeks to tackle 
their alcohol responsibility head-on.
All right, I can buy that. After all, weve 
all said some stupid things from time to 
time. Open mouth, insert foot  it hap
pens to everyone.
Besides, a Greek-wide BYOB policy isnt 
all that interesting. In the first place, its
If one house starts doing something totally 
different from the other houses, then they're 
going to be ... ousted from the social scene.
f Matt Ireland, 
CMU IFC president
a bad idea. Under BYOB, not only would 
the Greeks be dodging their duty to ad
dress alcohol awareness through washing 
their hands of the problem, but thered be 
less control of what students would be 
drinking at fraternity parties.
Furthermore, lets be honest. The BYOB 
policy stinks because the day it went into 
effect, individual brothers would be press
ing cans of beer into your hands as you 
entered their house. Essentially, beer distri
bution would move from a centralized to a 
decentralized source at parties  big deal.
No, the pros and cons of BYOB arent 
very interesting. What is interesting about 
the whole issue is the way Ireland is ap
proaching the leadership challenge of alco
hol management.
Hes going about it the wrong way, and 
hes being shown up by his Pitt counterpart 
in the process.
Irelands idea is that alcohol liability is a 
problem requiring system-wide Greek co
ordination along with a liberal dose of 
administrative hand-holding. If [Greeks 
are] ever going to approach this problem, 
he said last week, were all going to have 
to do it together, and that includes the 
administration, too.... They havent set 
down any specific guidelines to anyone. 
Until that happens, I dont think [the fra
ternities] are going to consider it.
Right now, the only thing Ireland is 
successfully leading the Greeks to is 
uninspired followership. He seems to have

Protests refresh stale thoughts of CMU students
Richard Robinson
As I sat down to write today, I 
heard a bunch of chanting going 
on. I looked out my window and I 
saw a bunch of women standing in 
front of Theta Xi, banging things 
and yelling. I live right next door to 
that house, so of course it attracted 
my attention.
It seems the party posters Theta 
Xi had put up upset some women. 
They believed it to be sexist and 
derogatory and all that. I person
ally only caught a glimpse of the 
posters as they held them up and 
chanted such things as, We wont 
be your fucking whore, and, This 
sexist bullshit has to go.
I found the whole situation kind 
of funny. There were 10 to 15 
women protesting, a couple of CMU 
police, a guy videotaping the inci
dent on a camcorder, Theta Xis 
hanging out on their porch watch
ing the protest, guys and women 
from other houses walking through 
to get to their homes, and all the 
time, women going into Theta Xis 
party, ignoring the protestersto 
me, all in all, a very funny situation.
The funniest part was seeing 
people walk through the protest 
with a look of what the hell on 
their faces. Almost every person 
that walked near the chanting 
protesters walked much faster than 
they had before.
Now, I dont want to put the 
protesters down. I think they had a
point, and I feel better knowing 
that people havent forgotten their 
given right to speak out freely  
not that Id do it in the cold on a 
Saturday night. But Im very im
pressed that people on this cam
pus do think for themselves and 
dont take shit lying down.
Think about it. When was the 
last time there was any type of 
protest on campus? Im not advo
cating chaos and anarchy, but its a 
nice change from this old conser
vative mode of going through the 
system of lodging a complaint or
simply ignoring something that 
ticks you off.
Of course, everyone remembers 
the flag burning last year. That 
wasnt a protest. What the women 
did in front of Theta Xi was a 
protest. The flag-burning incident 
was a fiasco. Everyone running 
around going insane over a person 
who decided to say fuck you to 
the administration in a rather open, 
silly waysilly because flag burn
ing isnt that big of a deal.

Seize control of your mind
Kevin Barney
Mind control. Is it really possible or is 
it something that only happens in old scifi movies when an alien insect is im
planted in your brain?
Mind control is a lot closer than you 
might imagine. Mind control techniques 
are used by all kinds of groups to achieve 
all kinds of goals. These groups are not 
just secret satanic cults, either. Ive seen 
commercials on TV, in newspapers, in 
magazines, andheard them on the radio 
for the services offered by these groups.
On a good note, all of these groups 
arent evil, blood-drinking, cow-killing 
organizations that have to meet in 
graveyards at midnight. Some of these 
groups save lives. Alcoholics Anonymous 
uses some of these techniques to help 
people to stop drinking. A lot of quitsmoking companies use the same tech
niques. Religions also use mind control.
These mind control techniques are di
vided into four general categories: con
trol of behavior, thoughts, emotions, and 
information received. These categories 
include controlling the amount of food 
and sleep that a person gets.
Last week, Fritz Knabe, a CS graduate 
student, lectured to about eight people 
about an experience involving mind con
trol that changed his life. In his first year 
at GMU as a graduate student, Knabe 
waslrecruited by Lifespring, a destruc
tive cult, as he calls it. For several 
months, he was involved with this cult
which used mind control techniques to 
control its members. For $450, Knabe 
was able to attend a basic training course 
that lasted a couple of days. For an ad
ditional fee, he attended the advanced 
training, a five-day intensive course in 
mind control. Of course, the trainees 
didnt know what they were getting into.
Knabe cited several examples of how 
these techniques were implemented in 
Lifespring. In the advanced training, the 
participants slept three to five hours a 
night and ate only twice a day; once in 
the morning and then again in the late 
afternoon. In addition to the physical 
restrictions imposed upon them, their 
thinking was confined to certain areas. 
There was no time for a person to just 
stop and think about what was happen
ing. Emotions were brought out into the 
open. One exercise was called the 
hugline. This exercise was extremely 
moving and emotional, according to 
Knabe. Once a person is in Lifespring, 
that person goes out and recruits other 
people.
Religions also use mind control tech
niques. For instance, how many reli
gions can you think of that involve fast
ing?
What is the difference between a cult 
and a religion? Generally, religions are a 
lot older and hence have more history to 
base their beliefs upon. In fact, more 
people have died because of religions 
than cults. Sure, there was Jonestown in 
1978, but in the middle ages, there were 
the holy Crusades.
Mind control is also used to cure people 
of certain addictions. It is used to slightly 
alter the personality of alcoholics or 
smokers or other addicts so that these 
people will no longer be addicted. It works.
Im not saying that mind control should 
not be exercised. Im just here to warn 
people of what can be out there. If some
one is using mind control to harm a 
person, either physically, mentally, 
emotionally, or financially, then its 
wrong. But if someone is helping that 
person by using mind control in a posi
tive way, then its all right.
At the end of the lecture, Knabe stated: 
Ask specific questions. Find out as much 
as you can before joining any type of 
organization. The cults of the nineties 
are here and they are harder to see than 
ever before.

graduated from high school. Here in the 
real world, we adults must solve our own

But to wait for the gods on Mount

Instead of waiting for the administra

how you slice it, one house is going to 
have to be the first to attack the alcohol 
liability problem  and that house, by 
definition, is going to be the leader.
Its the most effective  some would 
say the onlyway to get things done : Do
them yourself first, and then get people 
to follow you. Hey, guys, come on up

One house may say, SAE did it and

Smoking inflames sensibilities of non-smoker
Daniel de Grandpre
Passive cigarette smoke kills 53,000 nonsmok
ing Americans each year, making it the third-leading 
preventable cause of death.
 The American Heart Association
A lot of press has been given to Pitts recent 
change in smoking policy, and many are respond
ing with a call for do unto others as you would have 
them do unto you treatment. But that kind of
policy reeks of idealism.
You see, I would never blow known carcinogens 
into the face of a stranger, although theyve cer
tainly done so to me.
I happen to be one of those people who hates 
smoke. Physically. When smoke hits my eyes, they 
water. When it hits my nose, it runs. When it hits 
my lungs, I choke. Maybe its just me who gets ill 
around smoke, but the regulations now being passed 
at places like Pitt, Temple, the University of Wis
consin, and the state of California tell me that 
smoker-bashing is a pretty popular pastime.
Doctors and the Surgeon General tell us that we 
shouldnt smoke. Everyone knows that smoking 
causes cancer, complications during pregnancy, 
emphysema, chronic halitosis  everyone except 
R.J. Reynolds and Jesse Helms, and theyre the
biggest incentive to quit smoking in the free world
 the tobacco lobby and a declared bigot.
But maybe you disagree. So lets look at it from 
the smokers side.
For Gods sake, youre forgetting something, 
say the smokers.
We smokers are people. And we have rights. We 
can do whatever we want to our bodies.
And I agree. As much as I hate smoke, as much as 
I think women with chimneys hanging from their 
bottom lip are about as sexually appealing as vomit, 
they have the right to smoke.
As long as its in a sealed containment chamber 
where I cant smell it.
As long as the air they breathe out is recycled and 
the cancerous agents are removed.
As long as they dont leave those damn cigarette
butts lying on our floors and streets and stop throw
ing those little streaks of angry red flame out of their 
Camaros at night instead of using their ashtrays.
And as long as they prove that theyre in strict 
compliance with all these regulations.
Some say that regulating smoking is just like 
regulating pornography and obscenity. But reading 
a Hustler wont give you terminal lung cancer  
unless the paper is tobacco-based. Dirty magazines 
cant injure you. Free speech cant make you ill. But 
inhaling second-hand smoke may kill you.
So when you bitch about your right to smoke, 
dont forget  some of us are fighting for our right 
... to live.

Parallels to WWII: Hussein mirrors Hitler imperfectly
There are any number of 
.metphors surrounding our on
going warforgot about it, didnt 
you?  that strive to put affairs 
into perspective. Phrases like 
precision bombing, friendly 
fire, and the rest of the repertoire 
are antidotes to the reality of de
struction and wasteful deaths.
One of my favorite lets feel 
better about beating on this 
country comparisons to emerge 
from the Iraq vs. the Good Guys 
rhetoric is the Saddam HusseinAdolf Hitler matchup, at one point 
bandied about by George Bush. 
Although some find it easy to 
dismiss this mismatch immedi
ately, a closer look reveals some 
similarities  and differences  
between the Butcher of Baghdad 
and the Great Dictator.
To begin at the beginning, our 
couple enjoyed dissimilar youth. 
While Saddam has been fighting 
to survive from his earliest days
'J/ldJ I.
Michael T. Rose
as a child in rural northern Iraq, 
Adolf was bom into a middleclass family in Austria and went 
to Vienna at the age of 18 to study 
art. Hitlers philosophies, politi
cal and racial, grew into fullness 
over the five years he spent living 
in Vienna and his military ser
vice in World War I. Hussein had 
no opportunities for reflection; he 
was bom into a conflict-ridden 
nation and he moved up the only 
way he could  ruthlessly.
Both had historical models  
for Hitler, Caesar; for Hussein, 
Nasser  for their ambitions.
Hussein was a central figure in 
the Baath Partys ascension to 
power in 1968, after more than
thirty years of bloody revolutions 
and coups. As the partys chief of 
domestic security, he created a 
fearsomely effective national in
telligence network that has served 
him as he slashed his way to the 
presidency.
Hitler formed his own political 
party in 1920, and by 1923 he was 
arrested for high treason follow
ing the Beer-Hall Putsch. He used 
his imprisonment as a political 
stepping stone, writing Mein 
Kampf while he served nine 
months of his five-year sentence. 
Hussein was never in that posi
tion; he was the underdog only as 
long as it took for him to eliminate 
his competition.
Although the most visible con
nection between Hussein and 
Hitler is anti-Semitism, the cause 
of their individual attitudes are 
quite different. Hitlers racism 
arose from a personal moral 
vacuum, and it drove his nationHusseins persecution and slaughter 
of the Iraqi Kurdish minority seems 
eerily reminiscent of another tyrant's 
machinations toward a Final Solution.
alistic and expansionist schemes 
to their ultimate expressions. 
Husseins racism, on the other 
hand, is an ancient animosity 
finding expression in violence and 
threats  but it isnt driving his 
expansionism, at least not in the 
same way it drove Hitlers. 
Hussein may want to bum Israel, 
but its not his overriding goal in 
the way it was Hitlers.
Still, Husseins persecution and 
slaughter of the Iraqi Kurdish 
minority seems eerily reminiscent 
of another tyrants machinations 
toward a Final Solution.
While both men claim ambi
tions of empire, Husseins plans 
for Islamic Arab unity are paper 
platitudes; he only wants power, 
and his proclamations of grand 
destiny for the Arab people cloak 
his own personal ambitions. 
Hitlers desire for Aryan German 
preeminence was very real, and 
his insanity drove him to identify 
the Fatherland with his own cult 
of personality.
Some overriding similarities, in
checklist form: paranoid tyrant, 
yes for both; surrounded by syco
phants, yes for both; determined 
to fight to the end, yes for both. 
Unfortunately, the two are a good 
deal more alike than I would like 
to thinkSaddams saving grace 
in my eyes is that he will probably 
never have the opportunity to 
prove himself another Hitler.
I do say probably, and I do 
worry. Saddam has always sworn 
he would turn Tel Aviv into a 
charnel house, and I have to 
wonder  does he want to be 
another Hitler? For if he does 
attack Israel with chemical 
weapons, that is undoubtedly 
what he will have become.

Free speech knows no bounds
Jonathan Levy
*The best test of truth is the 
power of the thought to get itself 
accepted, in the competition of the 
market.... We should be eternally 
vigilant against attempts to check 
the expression that we loathe.
Former Supreme Court Jus
tice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
I assume they teach American 
history at Brown University.
After all, it is one of this 
countrys top colleges and one 
would expect its graduates to 
know something about the people 
and ideas that have shaped our 
nation.
Then again, a month ago I would 
have expected the same thing of 
the people running Brown and 
events seem to have proven me 
wrong.
I dont doubt that they are fa
miliar with the name, and perhaps 
even the quotation, above. You 
dont get a leadership position at 
atop school if you are uneducated.
But they cant possibly under
stand the importance of the 
statement or they wouldnt have 
done what-they did last month.
On January 25, Brown junior 
Douglas Hann exhausted his last 
appeal and was expelled from the 
university for the offense of 
speaking his mind.
Admittedly, the thoughts he 
expressed were racist and offen
sive. According to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette description of the 
October incident, they involved 
the combination of a number of 
unspecified obscenities and the 
words nigger, faggot, and 
Jew.
And I wont deny that the way 
he expressed those ideas  yell
ing them in a dormitory courtyard 
while drunkwas not the proper 
way to. express himself.
If Hann had been cited for dis
turbing the peace or disorderly 
conduct, my comments, if any, on 
the incident would have been in 
support of Brown.
In fact, I have no beef with Hann 
being punished for violating uni
versity rules against excessive 
drinking and showing flagrant 
disrespect for the well-being of 
others.
However, I have a big beef with 
his being punished for violating a 
year-old rule which bars students 
from subjecting another person, 
group, or class of persons to in
appropriate, abusive, threaten
ing, or demeaning actions based 
on race, religion, gender, handi
Hann was expelled from Brown be

unacceptable. The consequences of 
that action are infinitely dangerous....
cap, ethnicity, national origin, or 
sexual orientation.
That rule may sound innocent 
enough. It reads as if it is intended 
to punish intimidation and vio
lence against minority groups. 
But that is not the intent at all. 
Violence and intimidation were 
already illegal before this rule 
was adopted and all people, not 
just members of minority groups, 
were protected.
This and similar rules at col
leges around the nation are in
tended to punish what has come 
to be called hate speech.
Hann was expelled from Brown 
because the content of his speech 
was unacceptable. The conse
quences of that action are infi
nitely more dangerous than those 
of a drunk 21 -year-old yelling in a 
courtyard.
Students at Brown and other 
schools have been put on notice 
that saying the wrong thing can 
get you expelled. That notice 
cannot help but have a tremen
dously chilling effect on debate 
over important issues.
Once people have to start won
dering where the lines are drawn, 
they will be afraid to push the 
limits of acceptability and explore 
controversial positions.
Maybe 99 times out of 100 that 
will mean that someone is pre
vented from saying something 
hateful and offensive. One could 
make arguments on either side 
about whether that is good or 
bad.
But the 100th case will be 
someone who is deterred from 
taking an unpopular stand 
against a womens center or a 
minority program. When that 
happens, Holmes competition of 
the market will be dead. That 
fact is far more offensive and dan
gerous than anything you could 
shout in a dormitory courtyard.

"IT IMP OF EVEMS OUT'
Winning war on crime requires eliminating guns
George F. Will
In 1945, New Yorks movie censor 
banned Scarlet Street, starring Edward G. 
Robinson, because the ending was so 
shocking: a murderer remained at large. 
Today, inNew Yorks enlightenment, there 
is no censorship.
In1945, there were 292 homicides here. 
In 1990, there were about 2,200. In 1945, 
there were 1,417 armed robberies re
ported. In 1990, there were about
100,000, one every five minutes, and 
today robbery is under-reported by citi
zens accustomed to mayhem (such as 
390 car thefts a day) as a commonplace of 
urban life.
A1945 poll revealed that 90 percent of 
New Yorkers considered themselves 
happy. Today, 60 percent say they plan to 
be living elsewhere in five years, and crime 
is the primary cause of flight.
Such numbers trickle across the aircraftcarrier-sized desk of Police Commissioner 
Lee P. Brown. Long ago that desk belonged 
to a peripatetic commissioner who rarely 
sat still behind it: Commissioner Teddy
Roosevelts midnight rambles on the citys 
wild side made him a rising star. Brown, 
a large black man with three advanced 
degrees, is both praised and faulted for his 
phlegmatic manner.
He came here from Houston, a city 
with 1.7 million people spread over 600 
square miles. New York has eight mil
lion in 319 square miles. New Yorks per 
capita crime statistics are not the nations 
worst  for example, Washingtons ho
micide rate is two-and-a-half times that 
of New Yorkbut crime seems worse in 
the Big Apple because the density gives 
this city the nations highest irritability 
quotient. Many New Yorkers are quick 
on the trigger, literally. In 1960, hand
guns were used in 19 percent of homi
cides. Today, they are used in approxi
mately 70 percent. Until 1969, more kill
ings were by knives.
For more than a generation, the fun
damental act of American funwatching 
television  has involved, for the aver
age viewer, seeing 150 acts of violence 
and 15 murders a week. Is it really amaz
ing that life seems to have been cheap
ened? Brown is not amazed.
On the other hand, it has been plausibly 
argued that Americans are not so much
For more than a generation, the fundamental 
act of American fun f watching television f 
has involved, on average, seeing 150 acts of 
violence and 15 murders a week.
more violent than other people; they are 
only more armed. The argument is that 
you are more apt to see a fight in a 
British pub than in an American bar, but 
the British fight culminates in punches, 
the American fight in gunfire.
Brown is both proud of and appalled by 
the confiscation of 17,000 guns in 1990. 
But he is bailing an ocean  the tide of 
guns coming north from states (particu
larly Virginia, Texas, Georgia, and 
Florida) where gun restrictions are 
derisory.
In 1989,80 percent of those arrested in 
the United States for serious crimes had 
drugs in their systems. Drug disputes 
help generate this fact: The typical ho
micide victim is a young black male killed 
by a young black male he knew  only 
about 10 percent of homicide victims are
non-Hispanic whites.)
Drugs, like guns, are a tide against 
which no single city or state can erect a 
dike. But Brown, the calm at the eye of 
this citys storm about crime, does know 
what he can do: He can deploy more cops 
more usefully than in the recent past.
In medicine, much sophisticated re
search has resulted in proving that 
grandmother was right. The key to health 
is rest,- exercise and nutrition. So, too, 
police science has lumbered laboriously 
to the conclusion that grandfathers gen
eration knew a thing or two.
The newfangled notion of community 
policing is essentially the old-fangled 
notion that more police should get out of 
their cars and back on a beat.
There, they can deal not just reactively 
with crime, but proactively with the dis
orders loitering, poorly parerited chil
dren, panhandling, anxiety that drives 
people indoors. These are early indices' of 
neighborhood decay.
All that stands between the theory and 
the practice of such is the residue of the 
60s and 70s liberalism, which considers 
it fascist for police to buttress bourgeois 
societys norms of good behavior.
Commissioner Teddy Roosevelt went 
prowling in the wee small hours with 
Jacob Riis, thejoumalist who wrotej^Bow 
the Other Half Lives.
Like the patrician Roosevelt, Brown, 
the product of a blue-collar family, is 
concerned with the social incubation of 
crime. When Brown was a boy, the fam
ily dinner table was where his parents 
looked me in the eye to see if I had done 
something wrong. Now, he says, ifjjiany 
young men eat with their families &t all, 
it is cafeteria style.
Brown knows that the key to fighting 
crime  primarily a product of young 
men  is in things that grandmother 
and grandfather took for granted.

dent. Do you care that much about 
what goes on at this school? It 
doesnt show at all. Do you care 
that tuition is going up? Does it 
matter to you if the administration 
doesnt fulfill its promises? Do you

know what the hell our student 
government does?
Mostofyou probably dont. Youre 
content with making it through 
school as best you can. Even if a

matter. I know how you feel. I was 
like that. I even let a teacher get 
away with screwing me over  
deliberately giving me a grade 
lower than those given to women
in my class because I was male.
I could have complained. I didnt. 
I lost because I gave in. It bothered 
me, so Why didnt I do anything? 
Because I was like the rest of you. 
Content with not doing anything 
that would give me more work.
Like I said before, Im not advo
cating chaos and anarchy. Im not 
even advocating protests. But if 
something really bothers you, do 
something.about it. Say something. 
Dont just sit back because you 
dont want to cause yourself more 
work. But dont start going around 
making up problems.
Thats why I like what the women 
at Theta Xi did Saturday night. 
They didnt create the problem. 
They may have taken it a bit far
when they started in on the mas
turbation chant, but still they acted 
on something that annoyed them.
Now, I said I like what they did. 
But to throw a twist in, I dont 
believe it when they say that all 
fraternities are a bunch of sexists. 
If I believed that, I would have to 
believe that Im a sexistwhich I 
hope Im notand that sororities 
are female chauvinists.
So CMU, stand up for things you 
believe in. Dont give in because its 
too much trouble to bother with. 
But along the same lines, dont go 
making things up, and dont start 
problems where there arent any.

Bush needs domestic altruism
Richard Cohen
David Sewell of Cleveland, 
Tenn., was interviewed the other 
night on National Public Radio 
abofit his hobby  passing on 
computer messages to the troops 
in Saudi Arabia. But nothing 
about that really caught my in
terest. Instead, it was something 
he said about his son, a soldier in 
the Gulf. His boy was fulfilling a 
moral obligation.
Moral is my word. Sewell 
never mentioned it. He was asked, 
though, what he thought of the 
warmow that his son was in it. 
This is what he said: I know that 
my son is in harms way, but I feel 
thatwe have an obligation to other 
countries.
Now, you may think the United 
States is not doing the right thing 
i^L jijs Gulf and that Sewell and 
qouritless others have bought a load 
of-hnoey from President Bush. I 
disagree  but no matter. Whats 
striking about Sewells statement 
is that he not once mentioned oil 
nor-anything else suggesting selfinterest  not even an echo of the 
hawks argument during Vietnam 
thatj^f America did not make a 
stand in Southeast Asia, it would 
haveio do so in San Francisco. His 
remarks suggested altruism.
I suppose an argument could be 
made that such altruism can be
dangerous  that is akin to a 
moral arrogance which, occa
sionally, creeps into President 
Bushs statements (... the .S. 
has a new credibility and that 
what we say goes, he said Feb
ruary 1).
But when Sewell, or the millions 
of other Americans who the polls 
tell us feel the same way, speaks, 
arrogance is not the word that 
comes to mind. Instead, I con
trasted both his words and his 
tones with the evident apathy or, 
if you will, amorality, of some 
foreign voices.
Japan, for instance, seems genu
inely befuddled by the American 
involvement in the Gulf. It appar
ently recognizes no moral obliga
tion to come to the aid of a conquered 
nation nor, for that matter, to up
hold the rule of law. Even its own 
self-interest  it is more depen
dent on Middle East oil than the 
United Statesleaves it blas: it 
will pay more if it has to.
This altruism is relatively new. 
Ringing statements aside, most of 
our wars reeked of self-interest  
everything from self-defense to an 
attempt to extend American he
gemony, especially in the Western 
Hemisphere. It took an attack on 
Pearl Harbornot the crimes and 
aggression of Hitler  to get us 
into World War II.
But say what you will about the 
Gulf War, its hard to argue that 
self-interesteither self-defense
or selfishness  is the primary 
factor. In fact, this may be the 
first war the United States has 
fought since World War I thats 
mostly about an ideathe rule of 
lawand moral values, a repug
nance of Saddam Husseins bru
tal methods.
But if altruism explains Ameri
can support for a war in a far-off 
place, why does that same altru
ism seem to be missing when it 
comes to domestic matters?
Why would someone be willing 
to put a child out of harms way 
overseas but not to dig a little 
deeper to bail out the ghetto or, 
even, to take an interest in it?
Surely there are many expla
nationsracial animosity among 
them  but one of them has to be 
a lack of presidential leadership.
Its ironic that Bush was once 
faulted for not explaining why he 
sent troops to the Gulf. It now 
seems that the American people 
understood all along.
Whats more to the point, and 
more mystifying, is why neither 
he nor a potential Democratic 
presidential candidate feel they 
can tap American altruism when 
it comes to domestic matters. A 
President who can rouse Ameri
cans to support war where selfinterest is not the primary factor 
could at least attempt to mobilize 
public opinion on the domestic 
front as well.
But we get no indication from
Bush that he will attempt any
thing of the sort. As for leading 
Democrats, they are equally si
lent. The word sacrifice, uttered 
with abandon when it comes to 
fighting abroad, is never mentioned 
when it comes to tackling the 
problems Americans face on the 
homefront.
In order to do something about 
the appallinginfant-mortality rate 
in the inner city, for instance, the 
administration would take money 
from other programs for poor 
pregnant womennot from more 
affluent Americans.
Franklin D. Roosevelt could 
teach Bush a thing or two. His 
greatness rests on the twin pillars 
of triumph abroad and triumph 
at home  a willingness to use 
the moral suasion of the presi
dency on both fronts.
Bush has within his grasp the 
former, but not the latter. If 
greatness is what he seeksand 
what President doesnt?  then 
he would be advised to examine 
the sentiments of plain-andsimple Americans.
David Sewell would sacrifice his 
son for an idea: a better world. 
Surely, he could be convinced to 
sacrifice something less valuable 
 a few more bucks  for yet 
another idea: a better America.

be high school volleyball teams practicing 
in the gym. They are not listed on the 
schedule of reservations for the gym, and 
there is never a post indicating that the 
gym is reserved for that purpose.
. During the evenings on weekdays, the 
gym-is almost constantly in use by IM 
sports, which leaves out that time for 
recreational playing or for IM teams to 
practice.
feel that IM sports are definitely 
n^fjed and provide a good service to the 
CM]IJ community. It is unfortunate, how
ever- that playing on an IM team is about 
the-only way to use the facilities.
The athletic facilities here at CMU are 
inadequate to service the CMU commu
nity^ and having non-CMU people using 
th^facilities compounds the problem. Its 
time to stop letting others use our facili
ties, Mat least those facilities that are in 
hig^ demand. Let those of us who pay 
loads of money use the gym.

Letter to 
the Editor
editmk:
j In the last issue of 
The: Tartan, a letter 
was, printed from a 
CHQstian M. Restifo 
[Protestors: Dont 
take your promises lightly, 2/11]. His 
letter was directed toward the peace pro
testors. As a peace protestor, I would 
appreciate the opportunity to reply to 
Mrrfiestifos letter.
Dgar Mr. Restifo,
IEROMISE.
YSiir letter touched on an incredibly 
important issue, and I thank you for 
raising it. However, it is a very delicate 
question. Although I can sit here and 
relffjrmy sentiments in complete honesty, 
alas;;; I am but one person. I am not 
\vn&ngthis on behalf of any organization.
Unfortunately, I can foresee some 
persons in our organizations who will 
not stand by the quote, We Support Our 
Troops. And those people will leave our 
organizations once the war is brought to 
its much needed conclusion. (I strongly 
urge everyone involved in any organizaremain working as hard if not harder 
within the groups they currently serve 
once peace is obtained in the region.)
Peace is a concept we should all work 
towards. If you are currently unaware, 
the groups Pittsburgh Students for Peace 
at Pitt and Students for Peace at CMU 
have been founded with the intentions of 
continuing existence after the war is 
over; to remain working for peace in all 
regions of this world (including the 
United States). Your suggestions of vol
unteer work in VA hospitals was indeed 
a wonderful suggestion. Thank you.
Mr. Restifo, in response to your com
ment, ... stunts like the one involving 
the attempted delivery of a body bag...., 
I can only assume that you are referring 
to acts of civil disobedience. (I do not 
know if you are referring to acts of civil 
disobedience in general or just those 
involving body bags. However, I shall 
address my comment to general acts of 
civil disobedience.) Acts of civil disobe
dience are performed for a purpose. They 
disrupt daily routines  No Business 
As Usual! These acts need to be dra
matic in order for people to really give 
thought to the reasons behind the action. 
As Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote, in his 
Letter From a Birmingham Jail, Non
violent acts of civil disobedience seek to 
create a crisis....
If we anger or disturb a person, or 
create a crisis in their thoughts, then our 
actions will not be so easily dismissed.
Mr. Restifo, to address your concerns 
about media coverage, I have but one 
thing to say: The major media networks 
are playing Bushs game of misinforma
tion. The networks are working hard to 
make protestors look bad because that is 
the way the Bush wants us to look. This 
is his war, both a war in the Persian Gulf 
and a war of disinformation directed, 
towards the American public.
I would like to thank Mr. Restifo for his 
letter. He raised valid points that need to 
be addressed by all protestors regardless 
of which side they are protesting. I urge 
all protestors to reread Mr. Restifos letter 
and take his questions to heart.

constantly. We can make all kinds of 
excuses for why it was that the writer 
wrote what he did, but I dont give a shit. 
The fact is that on a daily basis, minori
ties and women in this country are sub
ject to derogatory remarks and actions. 
These insults wear away at the soul. 
Frequently, I am not aware of why I am 
angry, hurting, and feeling anxious until 
I review my interactions. Tiny comments, 
made innocently or not, can stir up anger 
that surprises me; but I dont explode. 
Somehow the furys absorbed and vented 
later. This is dangerous.
The White America sees itself as ward 
of the world, knowing whats best for 
lesser peoples. And in seeing the rest of 
us in this manner, it can do its will and 
insult and cause pain in the name of 
humor and play and feel no obligation to 
apologize for the damage done.
What you say amongyourselves is none 
of my concern. You can curse or praise 
me in privacy, but dont deny me my 
peace and opportunity to live as you wish 
to. I would hope that in this university, 
the American ideals would prevail over 
supremist American ideals. If you truly 
did not intend to be offensive, then think 
about why it was offensive and apologize 
straight up. Freedom of speech is not the 
freedom to inflict pain.

therefore, I was pretty much aware of 
what was going on.
Since the beginning of the Middle East 
issue, I have been reading and listening 
to the news with as much interest as the

most likely it was going to hit home. 
Innocently, though, I never thought my 
home. It was on Thanksgiving that my 
sister, who was a reservist in the Army, 
was called to the Middle East. She left 
January 1. Her being there was reason 
enough for me to face the real world 
around me. I had woken up from the 
deep sleep of ignorance.
The entire situation of the Middle East 
war and what it represents has moti

an Iraqi man holding a child tightly in 
his arms. Both had rags covering their 
bodies and faces. They were dead lying 
on a street. As I stared at the photo, I 
asked my husband what had happened 
to them. He explained they were Kurdish

Saddam Hussein used on his people to 
calm them down from wanting an inde

I continued staring at the picture until 
I felt sick. Then, I did the easiest thing to

I didnt even care what the results were

Im writing in re
sponse to your review 
of the movie Sleeping L6tt6i tO 
with the Enemy [Julia PHofrfii'Roberts disappoints in Iiie ct,llor 
Sleeping with the Enemy, 2/11]. Besides 
the fact that I disagree on the reviewers 
opinion that the movie was a disappoint
ment  I really enjoyed and was moved 
by it  I have to protest some of the 
claims the reviewer made.
First of all, how much more of a back
ground sketch of the two main charac
ters could possibly be given in the time 
frame of the movie? Things are presented 
as the movie moves along. How can the 
reviewer say that life seems great and 
that Martin Burneys abuse of his wife 
happens suddenly? Its obvious that there 
is discontent and fear on Laura Burneys 
part. And the physical mistreatment is 
just an explosion waiting to happen.
Now this is the part of the review that 
really gets me: The reviewer says that 
there is no explanation as to why the 
abuse is administered. Thats one of the 
points the movie is trying to convey. 
There is no explanation or justification 
of domestic violence! No woman deserves 
to be abused by her husband, especially 
if he proclaims to love her. As to the 
reviewers statement, Nor is there any 
plausible explanation as to how hes 
trained her to wait on him hand and 
foot. Of course there is. Shes afraid of 
what hell do to her if she disobeys him!

I was walking 
around the Carnegie 
Shoppe this weekend L6tt6f tO 
looking for a Valen- +u pHitnr 
tines Day card when I CUIlUI
noticed naked women on the front of two 
magazines for sale. To my surprise, I 
realized that the Carnegie Shoppe is 
selling Playboy and Penthouse. The 
Carnegie Shoppe is a school store that 
sells CMU clothing, holiday cards, and 
magazines such as Time and Newsweek 
whose purpose is to inform us on im
portant topics of the week. The pictures 
contained in Playboy and Penthouse do 
none ofthis. Instead, they degrade women 
to a low of sexual objects to be treated 
with no respect.
Pornography is much more than what 
some people say is skin. This is easily 
seen by examining a Penthouse magazine, 
May 1984, in which an uncle recounts 
his sexual abuse of his niece. The uncle 
tells of his niece screaming as he beats 
her in foreplay preliminary to a variety 
of sex acts. It is recounted in graphic 
detail, providing malignant fantasy ma
terial for the reader. These kinds of 
magazines deserve no shelf space at our 
Carnegie Shoppe. These two magazines 
contain nothing but disgusting photo
graphs which degrade women.
Further, support of what bad thoughts 
are promoted by these pornographic 
magazines can be easily seen by the 
correlation .between rape and pornogra
phy. A study released by the University 
of New Hampshire in the spring of 1984 
showed that the states which had the 
highest readership of pornographic 
magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse, 
etc. also had the highest rape rates.
Selling these magazines in a school 
which is supposed to promote a non
discriminating environment is an in
sulting put-down. Its disgusting that 
the women on this campus have to be 
subjected to this. I ask Carnegie Mellon 
to become aware of this problem and to 
take the necessary steps to rid this 
campus of these pornographic and hu
miliating magazines.

Women clinch UAA title
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
Theres no 
place like home
Another season on the road 
has come to close. While its 
been finalized that the womens 
basketball team wiH have some 
sort of post-season action, it 
wont be quite the same as the 
mega-road trips of the past 
month.
It will be more intense, more 
serious, and, most importantly, 
there wont be quite so many 
eople going.
Ive got to hand it to our 
athletic department, and 
Assistant Athletic Director Joan 
Maser in particular; theyve 
done a heck of a job taking care 
of our athletic teams (and our 
Tartan reporters) on the road. 
Scheduling a weekend for 40 
people has got to be a logistical 
nightmare, but things have 
gone relatively smoothly on the 
road this season.
I emphasize the word rela
tively here.
The airborne experience has 
been pretty good to us ... with 
the exception of a certain 
Chicago to St. Louis connection 
last month. To this day, I still 
believe that Chuck Yeager got 
control of our plane that day 
and decided to put it through its 
paces.
Im hardly a master aviator, 
but I do know you shouldnt dip 
your nose down 20 degrees on 
final descent. Its safe to say 
theres at least one airline Im 
never flying with again.
Its always on the ground that 
our problems begin. For this one 
you can ask Phil Bronner, who 
is probably the player who is 
going to miss the road the least. 
When Phils luggage got lost 
two weeks ago it was written off 
to bad luck, but Phils bag took 
wrong turn again this week
end. In the poetic irony cat
egory, Phil had even brought a 
different bag because he 
thought the first bag would get 
lost if he brought it again.
Im stunned that two different 
airlines in two different cities 
could lose the same persons 
jage, to say nothing of how 
Phil must feel. Add to that the 
fact that Womens Assistant 
Coach Lisa Lightner also lost a 
tag overnight in Boston and 
weve had more luggage prob
lems in one trip than in the 
previous six trips Ive been on.
Usually we just lose the 
buses. Currently the over-under 
on the average wait on the bus 
from the airport stands at about 
14 minutes. I hear there was a 
soccer trip where the bus was 
actually stolen, but I managed 
to miss that one. Oh, thats 
right, thats the one where the 
soccer team left without me.
Im not all that mad, though. 
They were done with practice, 
early so they left for Rochester 
early. More importantly, this is 
the same soccer team that 
opened the over-the-wing exit 
while we were pulling away 
from the gate.
I attribute that act of stupid
ly to the team because I cant 
remember which player was 
sitting by the window. I just 
^member staring at the exit 
door for the entire flight, as if 
mental will was the only 
thing holding the door closed.
Overall, though, it has been a 
good year on the road and I 
cant wait till next year. After 
aU. you havent really lived 
Until youve seen a USAir clerk 
turn pale at the prospect of 
checking bags for 40 people.

BOSTON, Mass.  The CMU 
womensbasketball team clinched 
a share of the University Athletic 
Association championship yes
terday, downing Brandeis 57-54. 
The win, the teams 20th of the 
season, also set a single season 
recordforregular season victories.
Junior guard Heather 
ODonnell hit a three-pointer to 
give the Tartans a 5752 lead 
with 20 seconds remaining. 
Brandeis guard Kara Romanelli 
cut the lead to three with seven 
seconds left, but the Judges were 
unable to pull any closer before 
time expired.
I was expecting to wear them 
down more, said Head Coach 
Gerri Seidl. They played well for 
a team that played three games 
this week.
It hardly looked as if the Tartans 
were going to have any trouble 
when the game started. After a 
relatively close start, Carnegie 
Mellon went on a 14-2 run, mak
ing the score 22-10 with seven 
minutes to go in the half. Brandeis 
countered with six points of their 
own, but went to the locker room 
trailing 28-19.
Our press was a big factor, 
said Seidl. I think it gave them a 
lot of trouble.
The first 10 minutes of the sec
ond half seemed to be just as 
lopsided as the first 20. The Tar
tan lead ballooned to 14, includ
ing eight by sophomore forward

f Head Coach Gerri Seidl
Amy and Jeanine did most of 
our scoring in the first half, said 
Seidl. We needed a guard to come 
alive forus, andKelly didthejob.
With just under seven minutes 
to play, the Tartan lead stood at 
14; however, Brandeis had hope 
due to Tartan foul trouble. The 
Judges held the bonus for the 
final nine minutes and scored 12 
of their second half points at the 
free throw line.
An 8-2 Brandeis run made the 
score 5452 with less than a 
minute to play. The Judges could 
not pull even, though, and 
ODonnell hit her three-pointer 
to ice the victory.
Junior forward Amy Buxbaum 
led the Tartans with 18 points 
and 14 rebounds. Sterling added 
16, and freshman forward Jeanine 
Megahan added 10 despite play
ing on an injured ankle.
The Tartans warmed up for the 
Brandeis game by thrashing 
Suffolk Univer sity, 92-34, on Fri
day night. All 10 players scored 
as the Tartans breezed to the 58- 
point victory.
There was never any doubt as 
to the outcome of the contest. The 
Tartans opened the game with a 
14-2 runthe only Suffolk points 
came off a questionable foul call 
on Buxbaum.
From there it was all downhill 
for the clueless Rams, who went 
to the half trailing 45-10.
The second half was more of the
same. Sophomore forward 
Chandra Buist scored with 15:09 
left, putting every Tartan on tte 
scoreboard. In addition, fresh
men Diane Jakubiak and Trish 
Henrich scored their first career 
points in the contest.
The Tartans were led^'by 
Megahan, who scored 25 points;1 
three other Tartans reached 
double digits. Freshman forward 
Mary Moore led the Tartans-in 
rebounding with 13.
The Tartan victory over 
Brandeis raised the Tartans 
season record to 20-5 including a 
112 mark in the UAA. Washing
ton Universitys 64^57 loss at New 
York University, its third confer
ence loss of they year, ensures-the 
Tartans a share of the UAA crown.
Im excited, but I want to win it 
outright, said Seidl. I dont want 
to share that [the UAA title]^ 
Since the Tartans swept 
Washington in the season secies, 
they will also win the tiebreaker 
for the conference playoff berth. 
However, a win against Roches1 
ter in Wednesdays season finale 
will give the Tartans soleposession of the UAA title.
Theyre a scrappy team, said 
Seidl. Theyre very string 
physically ... and theyll try* to 
wear us down. Were going to have 
to be very sharp and execute well 
to win. ^ '
Wednesdays game will begin 
at 6 pm. =*
Brandis loss snaps win streak
ar JnSON McoONnlo
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
BOSTON, Mass.  The CMU 
mens basketball team saw its 
three-game win streak come to an 
end yesterday as they lost to 
Brandeis University, 8777. The 
loss dropped the Tartans to 9-14 
overall, including a 3-10 mark in 
the University Athletic Associa
tion.
Theyre a good team, and 
theyre playing really well right 
now, said Head Coach Tony 
Wingen.
Foul trouble was one key to the 
Tartans loss as they committed 
29 fouls. Four players  senior 
guard Lewis Jackson, freshman
center Derek Dragisich, sopho
more forward Lammam Rucker, 
and freshman guard Matt 
Reiprishfouled out ofthe game, 
and the Judges converted 27 of 38 
from the charity stripe.
The Tartans suffered from cold 
shooting, especially in the first 
half. According to Wingen, we 
missed some easy shots. Lewis 
Jackson, [freshman guard] Mike 
Hosni, and [junior guard] Phil 
Bronner were 10 for 37. When we 
shoot like that, were going to 
struggle.
The Tartans went to the half 
trailing 39-32, and the Tartans 
held the margin around seven 
until they were forced to foul late 
in the game.
It was a very bland game for 
us, said Wingen. Were usually 
good for two or, three runs in a 
game, and we didnt put any to
gether today.
The Tartans also suffered from 
the loss of sophomore guard Todd 
Jenkins, who was injured in 
Fridays game against Suffolk 
University. First of all, it hurts 
our depth, said Wingen. Todd 
also has a steadying influence 
which youre taking out of the 
lineup. Anytime you lose someone 
who plays 25 or 30 minutes, it 
disrupts you.
[Sophomore guard] Matt 
Onaitis did a good job taking care 
of the ball and running the of
fense. He also made a few good
plays on defense.
Reiprish led Tartan scoring with 
14 points, and Hosni added 13. 
Five players tied for the team 
lead in rebounds with three each.
The Tartans had better luck on 
Friday, beating Suffolk Univer
sity by a final score of91-70. Four 
Carnegie Mellon players scored 
in double figures as the Tartans 
rolled to their ninth victory.
I was pleased for the most part, 
said Wingen. The things I had 
heard about them were basically 
true. They werent super-talented; 
you could get them down, but they 
wouldnt quit.
The Tartans opened the game 
with a 15-3 run, but it would be 
their largest lead of the half. The
Rams stayed within ten for most 
of the first half with a little help 
from the three-pointer. Suffolk 
hit four of six in the first half, ahd 
would hit six of 10 for the gaifi'e.
Late in the half, the Rams trifed 
to make a game of it. A 8-0 Hot 
streak led by high scorer John 
Cawley tied the game at 40 with 
10 seconds in the half, but Bronner 
beatthebuzzer to give theTartaris 
a 4240 halftime advantage. 1
The Tartans would never trail 
again in the contest. The Rairis 
remained close for the first-six 
minutes of the second half, but 
the Tartans used hot three-point 
shooting of their own to push their 
lead to 13 with less than 10 minVoluml mll w8d1 7uCl $4
Tartan announcer completes decade
ar JnSON McoONnlo
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Wednesday nights basketball 
games will be a milestone in CMU 
athletics, regardless of the out
comes. The season finale against 
the University of Rochester will 
mark the end of public address 
announcer Roger Rafsons tenth 
season as the voice of the Tar
tans.
Its like an announcing fix, 
said Rafson. Its a thrill for me 
and its been a lot of fun.
Rafson first became interested 
in announcing while at the Uni
versity of Illinois. Having been a 
DJ since he was 11, Rafson be
came involved in radio.
Tom Trent, who owned one of 
the local radio stations, was the 
voice of the Illini, said Rafson, 
and I was always impressed that 
he involved himself in that man
ner.
Rafson came to Pittsburgh in 
1981 to work for KDKA, and the 
Carnegie Mellon PA position ap
peared immediately. According to 
Rafson, I was just in the right 
place at the right time. Jim Ban
ner, who was the athletic director 
at the time, had just had a new 
sound system installed at the gym, 
and he needed an announcer.... 
He just gave me the job; I didnt 
even have to audition.
Rafson started as the announcer 
for mens basketball, but he soon 
expanded into football as well. 
Hal Neff, Rafsons predecessor for 
football, suffered a stroke and 
couldnt return to his job. Rafson, 
who had been a spotter for Neff, 
took over the announcers role.
The addition of womens bas
ketball to Rafsons job was the 
final piece of the puzzle. At the 
time there wasnt anything in the 
budget for the women, so I did it 
gratis for a season, said Rafson. 
They saw that it was valuable 
and they worked it into the bud
get.
Rafson has learned a lot about 
announcing in his ten years. It is 
very important to develop a 
rhythm. You have a lot of infor
mation to get across, especially 
on foul shots. You really have to 
be on top of things.
In football you have more play
ers to watch. You have to know
who threw the ball, who caught 
the ball, and who made the tackle. 
Rafsons hardly complaining. 
Overall, it is not that difficult, 
he said. I tend to take that for 
granted because I dont really 
consider announcing to be work. 
Even though he has ten years of 
memories to choose from, Rafson 
goes to this season in picking the 
most memorable games hes 
worked. Every home game for 
the football team was outstand
ing, he said. But it was really 
exciting to open the new stadium. 
I got to inaugurate the new field, 
which was a real thrill for me. 
Rafson also lists last Fridays 
womens basketball game against 
WashingtonUniversity among his 
highlights. The Tartans came 
back from a ten point half-time 
deficit to win in overtime, 5654.
Throughout his years at 
Carnegie Mellon, Rafson has 
thought highly of CMUs athletes. 
I liked to salute all the student 
athletes who do the balancing act. 
Ive always been impressed by 
how they manage time for work
outs and training in addition to 
their class work.

Ive always been pleased with 
the cooperation and support Ive 
received from [Sports Informa
tion Director] Bruce Gerson, 
[Athletic Director] John Harvey, 
and my three bosses - Coach Seidl, 
Coach Wingen, Coach Lackner.
Finally, Rafson has built a small 
wish list over the years. I wish 
more students would attend-the 
game, he said, And I wish-that 
the fraternity or sorority thats in 
charge of concessions [A Phi O] 
would show up at more games.

Carnegie Mellon hockey extends win streak to three
ar onwe MnRT.N
. Tartan Staffwriter
'Yesterday evening, the Carnegie Mel
lon'hockey club went on the road to 
Kftfanning to take on league rival Indi
ana University of Pennsylvania.
After a slow start, CMU came back in 
the second and third quarters to take the 
win from IUP for the second time this 
season, winning 5-4 as graduate stu
dent Erik Galis scored his second straight 
hat trick.
. The first period went to IUP, as it 
struck first with 6:41 left in the period. 
With only 1:15 in the period, Galis began 
the CMU scoring on the only power play 
of the game, tying the score at 11. IUP 
owjied the first period, said senior capj tain Dennis Frey. They came out fired 
up and just outskated us, but the second 
and third periods were a different story. 
. And so they were. Galis scored his 
. second goal of the day 4:55 into the secop.cl period with the assist from Frey to 
take the lead 2-1. IUP fought the stingy 
defense and junior goalkeeper Dave 
Sealfon for the tying goal with 8:19 left in 
the period. IUP scored with 1:17 left in 
thperiod, looking to go into the inter
mission with a 32 lead. But it was not to 
be. Graduate student Mark Li performed 
a miracle as the first line took the ice for 
the final minute. Fellow grad student
Chris Keim made the assist to Li with :51 
left, tying the score 3-3. But Li wasnt 
finished. Galis and Keim assisted Li for 
the second goal of the final furious minute 
of the second period. CMU left the ice up 
4-3 and a period to play.
The third period, though low scoring, 
proved to be the most intense period of 
the game. Carnegie Mellons defense 
shone through, limiting IUP to only 34 
shots on goal throughout the entire game, 
compared to 50 shots in the last game. 
Galis scored unassisted with 10:30 in the 
game, giving Carnegie Mellon a 5-3 lead. 
At 8:16 in the game, IUP tightened up 
the score at 5-4. But defense was the 
name of the game for Carnegie Mellon, 
as they held on to contain the IUP offense. 
With :46 left in the game, IUP pulled 
their goalie in an attempt to score the 
tying goal, but Sealfon made the saves to 
hold on to the victory, CMUs third 
straight.
It was a defensive struggle, said Frey. 
Dave [Sealfon] kept us in the game in 
the first period. And the second and third 
lines went out and played well. It was a 
real team effort.
Friday night, the CMU hockey club 
took the ice in its last home game against 
Penn State West, who won in their last 
matchup. Carnegie Mellon, without 
junior captain Ed Kilduff, who was sus
pended for two games for fighting, played 
a great game despite his absence.
It was a defensive struggle. Dave [Sealfon] 
kept us in the game in the first period. And 
the second and third lines went out and 
played well. It was a real team effort 
f senior captain Dennis Frey
Only 42 seconds into the game, Galis 
set the pace for the CMU hockey team as 
he scored what was to be the first of his 
three goals on the night.
From the first drop of the puck, 
Carnegie Mellon dominated the game, 
hitting hard and scoring quickly. The 
first period went completely Carnegie 
Mellons way, as Galis opened the game 
with a goal on the first shift (assists from 
Li and Keim).
The second goal was scored shorthanded, as Galis broke away and took it 
to the net with 11:36 remaining. Up 2-0, 
the team played more defensively, allow
ing only seven shots on goal, all of which 
Sealfon saved from the net.
The first period was plagued with 
penalties, giving an indication of the 
intensity with which the two teams 
played. PSWs Vic Murphy went out with 
1:36 to give CMU the power play, and 
George Mueller took advantage as he
escaped on the breakaway and fired a 
shot into the net with four seconds in the 
first, giving Carnegie Mellon a 3-0 lead 
into the second period.
We played great the first couple of 
shifts. Scoring early added confidence 
and everybody was into the game, Galis 
said.
The second period opened much more 
calmly, though CMU continued to 
dominate physically, as the teams skated 
for position for the first seven minutes. 
But PSW finally scored on a power play 
at 7:59 in the second to close the gap a 
little. CMU came out after the goal, 
though, and scored 1:03 later as the third 
line showed their worth. Coach and 
graduate student Dave Collins noted, 
The third line was the strongest its ever 
been. They proved it not only by hitting 
hard, but by scoring the goal. Sophomore 
Ted Miller took the assist from freshman 
Scott Naidech to extend the lead back to
3, putting CMU up by a score of 4_i
CMU scored again with 4:45 left before 
the intermission, giving Chris Keim and 
Mark Li their second points of the game 
Gary Keim fed the puck to Li, who then 
left it for Chris Keim to put in, lifting 
Carnegie Mellon to a 5-1 lead and nearly 
guaranteeing the victory.
The third period sped by, marked by 
good defensive play from CMU and a 
tense offensive attempt from PSW 
Shooting 12 times during the period 
PSW did manage one goal past keeper 
Sealfon. But it was far too little, far too 
late as Mark Spimak forced a shot from 
in close with only 2:51 left to play in the 
game. Leading 5-2, Carnegie Mellon 
opened up one last time when, while 
trying to kill time, Chris Keim skated at 
the net and left the puck for Galis to put 
away with 58 seconds left, lifting 
Carnegie Mellon to a 6-2 win in the final 
home game of the regular season.
Dave Collins had this to say after the 
game:Weplayedagreatgame. Our best 
by far. It was a solid game for Erik 
[Galis] and George [Mueller], We did it 
by not giving up the puck and controlling 
the physical game. But once again I was 
upset with the number of penalties. The 
physicality of Carnegie Mellon was ac
centuated by an injured PSW player near 
the end of the game who was reported to 
have suffered a broken rib, though this is 
unconfirmed.

compete at UAAs
Men pick up two wins 
as road season ends

Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
 womens swim teams wrapped up 
University Athletic Association 
competition by placing third and 
sixth respectively at the UAA 
Championships held last 
Wednesday through Saturday.
Junior Brian Zimmerman won 
and qualified for nationals in the 
500-meter freestyle, 200-meter 
freestyle and 1650 meter. He was 
also named the UAA Swimmer of 
the Year by scoring the most 
points in the championship. The 
1800-meter mens relay team, con
sisting of freshmen Todd Vandal 
and J.P. Lie, junior Norman 
Murray, and Zimmerman, also 
! advanced to nationals. Junior Jo 
Wollschaelger qualified for na
tionals in the 400-meter interme
diate medley and the 200-meter 
! breaststroke.
Zimmerman expected to do well 
in the meet since he had qualified
 for nationals every year since he
 was a freshman. However, he was 
surprised that the mens 800- 
meter relay team qualified for 
nationals.
Lie anticipated qualifying. I
didnt really expect it but I knew 
it was going to be close, he said. 
The Tartan relay team was able 
to beat John Hopkins University 
in dramatic style when 
Zimmerman took the lead in the 
last leg of the race.
This was the first time the 
members of the relay team had 
ever swam together. During dual 
meets we didnt have an 800 free 
relay, so we just brought it to
gether over there.
Five mens and six womens 
Carnegie Mellon records were 
broken in the championships in
cluding sophomore Jaime Millar 
in the 200-meter intermediate 
medley and the 200-meter 
breaststroke and senior Lesly 
McGill in the 100- and 200-meter 
backstroke.
Head coach Bruce Brondson 
was surprised with some of the 
Tartansperformances, especially 
Millars. Jaime only swam the 
200-meter IM once before, said 
Brondson. Since individuals are 
permitted to swim in three events 
Millar got to compete in the 200- 
meter IM and again beat his pre
vious time by over a second and 
achieved the school record in the 
event.

utes to play.
A122 run pushed the score to 
83-65 with just over a minute to 
play, and the Tartans padded 
their lead at the foul line to seal 
the win.
They played some good teams 
very close this year, and I was 
pleased we were able to put them 
away, said Wingen. Weve 
played to win over the last six or 
seven games, and I think thats 
been the biggest indicator of our 
success.
Bronner and Hosni led the 
Tartans with 18 and 17 points, 
respectively. Reiprish and Rucker 
were the other double-digit scor
ers with 15 and 13 points. Rucker 
also led the Tartans with eight 
rebounds.
In the weeks only other action, 
the Tartans completed a season 
sweep of Thiel College, winning 
71-68 in overtime. Bronner hit a 
shot with four seconds on the clock 
to win the game, and Dragisich 
added a foul shot after a stolen 
inbounds pass to seal the win.
I felt like we were escaping 
from the Twilight Zone said 
Wingen. It was a weird set of 
circumstances.
We were late because of the 
weather, the lighting was hor
rible, like beingunder a sun lamp, 
and the officiating was not that 
good. We didnt even reach the 
bonus in the second half until
Dereks shot at the end of over
time.
A three-pointer by Thiels Pat 
Parra set up the overtime as the 
Tartans were unable to retake 
the lead in the final 20 seconds of 
regulation. Carnegie Mellon 
missed its shot, but Thiels at
tempt to win the game fell wide, 
sending the game into extra time;
It was a very satisfying win, 
considering all we had to over
come, said Wingen. A month 
ago, we might have found a way 
to lose that game.
Bronner led the way to victory 
with 16 points, Dragisich and 
Hosni each added 14, and Jackson 
chipped in 11. Dragisich also led 
the Tartans with 14 rebounds.
The Tartans, who have now won 
four of their last six games, will 
finish their season Wednesday 
night with a UAA game against 
the defending Division III cham
pion, the University of Rochester.
Well have to rebound with 
them and take care of the ball, 
said Wingen. They play good 
defense, and theyll take advan
tage of any breaks you give them. 
The game, which starts at 8 pm, 
will be preceeded by a ceremony 
honoring Lewis Jackson, the 
teams only senior. Jackson, who 
came into this weekend averaging 
7.5 points per game and had a 
team-high 41 steals, will be 
playing his final game as a Tartan 
on Wednesday night.

Track athletes fly past competition at Robert Morris
gr NnTnl.e M. GeSMONo
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
ff0oens track teams held their 
oivn at the Robert Morris College 
Invitational last Saturday. De
spite illness and injury, both the 
pens and womens teams placed 
n several events against other 
Division I, II, and III schools.
With a time of 4:51.4, junior 
Carolyn Lowe broke her own 
school record in the 1500 meter 
race, by improving her time by 
eight seconds. She placed second 
iverall in the meet.
Im really glad I was able to 
break the five-minute mark, said 
Lowe. I was mainly working on 
py speed at the meet because I 
usually dont run the 1500 or 800 
meter races. I normally run the 
longer distance races [3000 meter 
and 5000 meter].
Womens Head Coach Dario 
Donatelli said, Carolyns been
setting personal best and school 
records all season and I think 
with Nationals coming up in three 
weeks, she is ready for it. 
Donatelli feels confident that 
Lowe will break two more school 
records by the end of the season 
in the 3000 and 5000 meter 
events. Were looking forward to 
it, he said. Shes running that 
well. When asked about break
ing another school record, Lowe 
said,I hope I can. Im sure I can 
break the 3000 meter record be
cause in the 5000 meter race last 
weekend [at the West Virginia 
University Invitational], my 3000 
meter split was faster than the 
record.
Also running well for the 
Womens team was sophomore 
Laura Sibley. She competed in 
the 1500 meter race with a time of 
5:19.5, taking sixth place overall. 
This was a new event for Laura, 
said Donatelli. This was a very 
good time for her first time in the
Were the best Division III team in 
the area. The team is definitely living 
up to its potential.
f Men's Head Coach Gary Meckley
1500 meter race. Shell be run
ning in this event for the UAA 
Championships. I think shell be 
ready.
Junior Susan Wempa placed 
fifth in the 55 meter dash with a 
time of 8.2 seconds.
The mens team made itself 
known at the meet by placing in 
several events. Sophomore Brad 
Shapiro took first place in the 
1500 meter and 800 meter races 
with times of 4:02 and 2:01, re
spectively. I felt really good about 
my performance at the meet,said 
Shapiro. I ran most of the race by 
myself but I felt real strong.... 
[The race] started out slow, but I
took off on the third lap and no
body caught up with me.
Mens Head Coach Gary 
Meckley said, Brad is doing very 
well. Hes gone against a lot of 
runners that are on athletic 
scholarships from Division I and
II schools. Also placing in the 
800 meter event were junior Bill 
Isaacs with a time of 2:03 taking 
second place, and freshman Erik 
Taborwithatimeof2:035 taking 
fourth place. In the 3000 meter 
race, senior Todd Balbera took 
second place with a time of 9:09, 
and junior John Friedertook third 
with a time of 9:11.
Taking third place in the onemile relay was the team of senior 
Jeff Illian, Isaacs, freshmen 
Jarrod Siket and Garrett Long 
with a time of 3:33.5. In the 55 
meter dash, Illian took third place. 
Long placed again with a second 
in the 55 meter hurdle.
Were getting better, said 
Meckley. There were a lot of great 
teams there[at the meet] includ
ing two Division I teams. What 
we do on the track is just as good 
as any Division I or II school. The 
whole team is doing well. When 
you compare them to other Divi
sion III teams, far and away, were 
the best Division III team in the 
area. The team is definitely living 
up to its potential.
With the UAA Championships 
coming up in just two weeks, both 
Meckley and Donatelli agree that 
the teams will not be training too 
hard. We wont be taking many 
people to the meet next week in 
Slippery Rock because we want 
everyone healthy and ready for
the UAA,said Donatelli. Weve 
done all the hard work overfthe 
past six weeks and we really cant 
do much but get healthy right 
now. Meckley believes that; the 
team is at a great disadvantage 
for the UAA due to the lack of 
facilities that other teams may 
not have to contend with. Were 
just going to be trying to keep 
everybody healthy and sharpen 
them up a little bit before,, the 
UAA, he said.
I feel pretty confident [aboiit 
the UAA], said Shapiro. If the 
individual events improve the way 
theyve been, well present some 
competition and people are going 
to see that Carnegie Mellonjs kt 
the meet. Lowe added, 1 think 
the team will all pull together and 
do well for the UAA.
The teams will travel to 'Slip
pery Rock University next Satur
day for their last meet before the 
University Athletics Association 
Championships in Chicago.^to 1

Fresh from 
Dossier Farms 
to You

---------------------------------------------------

Welcome to a new year of Dossier. Well be doing three more issues 
this semester, which means more stories, more poems, and, if were real 
lucky, more pizza coupons.
I know Im a few days late, but I'd like to take this opportunity to ask 
each and every one of you to be my Valentine. I had planned a special per
fume-scented issue, printed on red paper, that would fold out into a heart. 
Unfortunately, I got into a little argument with the printer, which ended in a 
nasty fist fight. So were stuck with black and white again. I still haven't 
made up my mind about Valentine's Day. It seems to make people who are 
already happy even happier, and make miserable people just a little more 
aware of their situation. On the other hand, it provides a lot of jobs for those 
guys who carve the messages into those little candy hearts. So I guess its 
not all bad.
I know a lot of you depend on Dossier for all your international news, 
so its my responsibility to tell you that while we were away, a war broke out 
in the Persian Gulf. As many of you know, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secre
tary-General of the United Nations, called in yours truly for some eleventh 
hour negotiations with the Iraqis. Unfortunately, the talks fell through when I 
refused to devote an entire issue to "The Free Verse of Tariq Aziz. I have my 
pjlnciples.
As always, my winter break was a time for quiet reflection. I was really 
able to sort some things out, and came to a few realizations that Id like to 
share with you. I realized that each of us is only here for a brief time, and we 
must strive to make the most of every moment. I realized that enjoying na
ture is not a right, its a privilege, and we must never abuse it. And I realized 
that our design editor Chris Shields looks an awful lot like kickboxer JeanClaude Van Damme.
Im proud to announce a new service which is now available to our 
readers - our very own 900 number. Just call 1-900-D-0-S-S-1-E-R for all the 
latest gossip about your favorite Dossier stars. Rnd out why Jen Bannan 
switched from number 2 to number 2.5 pencils. Discover Ron Lees favorite 
metaphors - the answer will shock you! And Ill pass along some of my world 
famous mountain biking safety hints. Dont sit home all alone - call today.
Our featured topic of the month is Ed McMahon. The Tonight Show, 
Star Search, sweepstakes, insurance commercials, and now literary maga
zines. That guy is everywhere.
I hope you enjoy this months selections. Thanks for reading, and well 
see you soon.
Jack Sllbert
Dossier is once again open for business. If youve got short stories, poems, 
short plays, or essays, we'd love to read them, and maybe even print them. 
The submission deadline for our next issue is Monday, March 4. Send your 
work to Dossier, c/o The Tartan, Room 50, Skibo. All submissions must be 
accompanied by name, address, and phone number.

I was under the influence of Nyquil the first time I kissed Marcus. He 
kissed me and I dropped the Nyquil bottle. We made footprints along the floor 
with the menthol-blue liquid and waltzed using the prints as a guide. A week 
later we made love in the elevator. The reason Marcus and I lasted two years 
together was a man named Ben. Ben was the training wheels balancing our 
otherwise lopsided relationship. Ben left school and Marcus and I crashed and 
skinned our knees. It was a bloody mess and not enough bacitracin to go around.
Before Marcus and I exploded, the three of us had existed in virtual 
harmony. We threw mattresses out windows, crazy glued various household 
objects onto furniture, and sang the blues in the public bathroom at three in the 
morning. If one of us fell asleep, the other two would crouch in the fluorescent 
stairwell and confess our biggest insecurities and our most painful memories.
Once Ben admitted to me: "I have a fear of being in well-lit rooms. In dark rooms I 
have a lot of confidence, but I feel so ugly when I'm in a room with bright lights 
on!" He also hated having color photographs taken of him, but black and white 
photographs he liked. He once made me take a whole roll of black and white 
pictures of him with a soccer ball shoved down his shorts.
Ben and I had an immense fear of flying. My phobia began at the age of 
nine when my sister explained turbulence as "the plane hitting some seagulls." I 
faced school vacations with anxiety because I had to risk my life in a DC10 to fly 
home to Boston, and because it meant whole weeks without Marcus within arms 
reach. Returning from vacation I would drop my bags outside the cab and sprint up 
six flights of stairs to Marcus' room. Once my antique, C Melody saxophone was 
stolen from the curb during one of those ten minute reunions.
One vacation the three of us went to Boston together. I stayed up all night 
before my flight, in hopes that I wouldn't have the energy to be afraid. 
Unfortunately, the next morning, I needed barrels full of energy for Ben who was 
so uptight he couldn't walk straight. "It's raining so hard, shit, we're never going 
to make it off the runway; I have a bad feeling about this Lori, I really do. Aren't 
you nervous? Lori, I really think this is going to be a bad one..." Ben's anxiety was 
unebbing. I had to peel him off of my lap as he clawed and drooled with the 
prediction of doom during our ride to the airport.
Ben was especially high strung because of our shaky departure. We had to 
leave our intended fourth party, Todd, at home because he couldn't stop vomiting 
from his Jim Beam-cheese doodle party the night before. When we came to his 
door, Todds friends were trying to hold him up and keep the leaking brown paper 
bag away from their feet and under his wet chin. "Lori, this isn't a good sign; 
there's no way I'm sitting with him on a plane. Lori, I don't like this..." Marcus had 
no patience for Ben's fretting; as usual, I had to play peace maker. Ben's paranoia 
evoked sudden and unexpected confidence from me. Wonder Woman cape and 
pantyhose on, I eased Ben's pain: "just think of all the planes that take off every 
second all over the world; it's the safest way to travel; just let the turbulence rock 
you to sleep; look at all the babies on the flight, it can't crash, all these young lives 
can't be ended this soon...", I applied all the logic that I used to soothe my own 
preflight convulsions. I know my random reasoning worked because Ben soon 
lapsed into the personality of our imaginary friend, 'Billybob.' He was Billybob, I 
was LulaMae, and Marcus was SammyJoe; we became three children of the farm 
who knew two joys in life, square dancing and the song, "I have a new cow, a true 
cow, a blue cow, named Caroline Moo Moo Moo Moo; she's a very special friend of 
mine Moo Moo Moo Moo." Singing away, we (Billybob, SammyJoe and LulaMae) 
sat in our fantasy hayloft and breathed in the chicken feathered breeze. No 
tapping on any of the portable Macintoshes could drown the sweet sound of 
Billybob, SammyJoe and Lula reminiscing about the greased pig contest during the 
last fair. Soon the four people sitting in front of us and the three in the back moved 
to a more sedate area of the plane.

---------------------------------------------------

During our stop in New York, we lapsed into our version of Marcus' 
favorite movie, To Sir With Love. The theme song, sung by Lou-Lou, Marcus' idol, 
resonated throughout the Kennedy airport; Gate 32, Gate 16, Gate 4~ "those school 
girl days...you watched me go from crayons to perfume, To Sir, With Love..." The 
quasi-Broadway voice of Marcus and Ben flowed throughout the sterile halls and 
ten dollar hot dog stands. The three of us clung together amid our fits of play; 
going to the bathroom was the only intermission we had from each other's grasps. 
Sometimes Marcus and I would lie and say we had to go to the bathroom, in an 
attempt to be alone for a few moments. Usually, in his agitation with the situation, 
Marcus would be brutally obvious about our scheme; Ben would get offended and 
put on his 'it's not easy being the third part of a couple' expression. The energy it 
took to convince Ben we weren't sick of him and we wanted him attached to our 
side ninety-nine percent of the time was not worth the possibilty of an intimate 
bathroom break. Ben would rebound with even more hyperness. "I'm so happy, I 
might even masturbate in the shower! he said once in a spontaneous burst of 
excitement (later he pretended he was only joking).
On the weekends, Marcus, Ben and I would escape to a friend's house, far 
away from the city, and play together in our own land. We'd walk through the 
front door, shut it behind us, and from that moment on, all that existed was 
Marcus, Ben and I. Whoever fell asleep first was sure to wake up with a gryphon or 
lizard tattoo sprawled somewhere on their body. Ben made pounds of pasta and 
Marcus always made a fire. We'd have the real kind of hot chocolate; a bit of 
cinnamon, miniature marshmallows, and the original Hershey chocolate (no 
Nutrasweet in sight), all steaming in bottleneck mugs to keep it forever warm. 
Huddled together tightly under my grandmother-made quilt, the three of us would 
sip with euphoria.
While Marcus and I were riding towards our destruction, Ben visited us 
during his break. No longer were Marcus and I the "babycakies, babycakies la la la 
la. What should we name our kids flower couple; we had transformed to snarling, 
"how could you be so stupid?!; Will you please get out of my facel", demons. Ben 
watched as I would clutch Marcus' arm, my hair flailing around the room, and plead 
for him to leave. Marcus became a crusty playdough toy with nothing inside but 
flour, water, sugar and food coloring; I had the little, red, plastic chisel to chip away 
at his evil dough soul. In my ninety dollar a month apartment it was too cold 
to sleep alone; I slept next to him, chisel tucked under my arm, prepared to attack 
at any given moment. Marcus and I would wake up for more spinning, punching 
and caressing. Clammy hands ground in the dirt and agony during our sudden and 
angry intimacy. Unable to see through all the murk and grime that Marcus and I 
kept hurling at each other, Ben left three days earlier than he had planned.
The corrosion between Marcus and I began and ended slowly. Our brutal 
weapons did eventually wear out and one morning, drained of negative energy, we 
severed our relationship at the wrists. A month later, Ben called me to say he 
found a ride from New York to Pittsburgh, and really wanted to visit me. I was in 
the process of putting my world of Marcus in an airtight box, but I told him he 
could come anyway. I hadn't talked to Marcus in a month, but the spit on the seal 
of my letter expressing some leftover hostility towards him was still wet. Ben's shiny 
face arrived at my door, waiting for me to jump up and down and scream, "once I 
was a schlepper, now I'm Miss Mazeppa... (his favorite musical - sung in a New 
York accent). I had phases of energy that I gave him, but most of our time together 
included me hoping there was a pleasant enough expression on my face that he 
would not ask me what was wrong.
By the third day I had no patience left to adhere to his demands for raw 
glee. After many small quibbles, we sat on my front porch. My crate from home 
had finally arrived; the home made, pine box, stuffed with clothes, lamps and 
books, to be emptied and converted into a coffee table, lay on my front porch. Ben 
unscrewed all of the screws as I sewed my curtains, trying to feel 'pleasant.' He 
rocked back and forth on the porch swing as I lifted up the top of my crate. There 
was my life, all folded and secured into one wooden box. I reveled in the world 
that arrived on my front porch. I unpacked in silence, making stacks and piles with 
my belongings. The tension in the air pushed its way into my cell and Ben asked, 
"What is wrong with you; I feel like after everything I say, you jump down my 
throat." I pictured how slimy and gross I would be if I did such an act, and made a 
repulsed face. He asked me what was wrong and I slowly, methodically told him in

---------------------------------------------------

a low drawl: you're demanding... I can't be anything less than spontaneous and
gloriously happy with you most of he time... I live with the perpetual fear that I'm 
letting you down, that I'm ruining YOUR fun... you dwell on your desires and yours 
only...You attack me with questions, you don't ask them...You ask me what's wrong 
like a candy-striper worried I need my bed pan changed - you'd rather it be 
something easy to deal with...your self absorbtion is too much for me to handle...
The words rang out of my mouth without hesitation. Plain and simple; I 
threw out all the rules of graciousness and spelled it out as ugly as could be. In 
disbelief, he stopped swinging. Numbed to this mystic melodrama, I fell into a 
trance. The more words that flew out of my mouth, the less I knew where I was 
and who I was talking to. The razor-sharp, lethal accusations told me it was 
Marcus, but through the haze it looked like Ben. Displaced in a soap opera people 
became Barbie and Ken dolls with unpenetratable outer skin. My anger was 
oozing everywhere. It got all over my porch, soaking my neat piles of clothes; it 
crept up my shins. I kept going; I continued to make organized piles and tried not 
to let them get any muckier. But the contaminated air was all there was to 
breathe. I spun around with horror at my piles; I could see Marcus' hairs woven 
into my favorite tweed pants; lumps of his dried up refried beans clung to the 
prongs of my forks; his social security number was written on a belt in his 
grandmother's handwriting; (could see his typewriter's ink marking my cassettes. 
More screws, I tried to find more screws; I had to quickly shut the crate, but I 
couldn't. Ben was looking at me. He stood on the lid with his steeltoed boots, as I sat 
motionless. I stood up and climbed into the crate. I curled up amongst my soggy, 
dripping piles, folded my hands under my chin, and tucked my knees in between my 
chest and arms. Ben smiled and slowly put the lid back on.

This photograph 
at Mother's childhood home, 
the dog I knew from ages 
two to eight. Her pet 
I trusted not to lick 
my face. The man 
in the next picture 
with his leering smile 
reminds me of the neighbor's 
hunting hounds 
which weren't so kind. 
Chasing me to some far 
corner of the farm, 
the game was fetching 
my curiosity. Like a pack 
of pointers, he led me to it.

It wasn't raining that hard, but I had my glasses on, so the 
streetlights became stars and the sidewalk wavered and 
blurred. I was wavering a little, half-drunk and trying to keep 
my feet on the slick concrete. I almost missed it; in fact It sat 
on the edge of my attention as I walked by and it wasn't until 
I had almost walked past it that the gold-tone lettering on the 
front caught my eye.
I turned and bent down, examining my prize. A small 
leatherette folder, with "Prom Memories" emblazoned in 
machine cursive. It was covered with water, but the contents 
had remained dry and apparently undamaged; unlike real 
leather, leatherette plastic can bear a little rain.
Inside, a simple color photograph set off by an oval-cut 
framecute kids, tan and fitboth in blackAsian man, 
Caucasian woman, both with white flowers against a setting 
of blue hotel wallpaper and seventies vintage carpet. As 1 
looked, a few drops of rain hit the picture, gently swelling the 
emulsion in spots.
I got the thing inside, to my cluttered dorm room. Clearing 
off a swatch of the desk with a quick arm sweep (two short 
stories, one critique, a biology paper, a copy of Playboy, 
andtragedya full marijuana pipe all go fluttering and 
bounding to the floor) I set it up, with the cover open to 
expose the photo. The miniaturized pair looked out on the 
chaotic vista of my room, smiles intact and cheer 
unimpaired. They seemed happy to be out of the rain, and 
they didn't mind my staring at them.
Their names are unimportant; let's say she's Janice, and 
he's Tom. We don't need to know where they come from;
San Jose, California will do. Why they're together for this 
picture is not really our concern, but it could be the Jacinta 
High Senior Promhe's probably off to college far away in 
the fall; she's going to go to the local community college. 
They could be kids from anywhere in the country, just two of 
the thousands of kids that go to the prom every year and 
keep their photos In leatherette cases. They could be anyone. 
I might have known them.
I guess they go back a few years, these two; they have a 
history. They certainly look like they want to be together.
Later that night, they have a reservation at the Sheraton. I 
bet they have sex for the first time. He's scared, and it hurts 
her, but they're in love so later, they try it again with better 
results.
Maybe she was a brain. He was good at math and he wanted 
to be an engineer, but she could always show him up. She 
was smarter than him and it had never bothered him much 
from time to time he pondered why that should be so. What
he failed to realize, and what she knew explicitly, was that he, 
like many men, equated superior intelligence with superior 
altruism. It would have taken substantial, repetitive cruelty to 
dislodge his feeling that she really had his well-being at 
heart
Of couree, substantial repetitive cruelty was not in her 
repertoire, but a certain aloof callousness was. She learned 
from her mother, who had used it on her wandering father, 
and she used it often on Tom. She used it when he ignored 
her in the eighth grade, when she was another dark-haired 
girl with glasses and bad teeth. She got contacts, and braces, 
and he noticed.
She used It when he started paying attention to her in the 
ninth grade, when she was a popular freshman and he was 
on the basketball team. Although thelrfriends thought they 
would be perfect for each other, they were content for a 
while to just be friends.
She used it when he asked her to go out with him in the 
tenth grade. He simply got used to it, and her aloofness 
wore down to affection.
They played little games on the phone when he was a 
senior. "May I come over?" he would ask on a Saturday.
"That depends, she would say, twirling the phone cord 
between her toes tipped with freshly dry nail polish.
"On what?" he would ask, knowing what the condition would 
be.
"On whether you're willing to fool around when you get 
here." She would smile, staring at the posters on her ceiling.
"I most certainly am.
"Then you'd better not come," she teased. "I'm not in the 
mood to fool around."
"Oh. Well...how about a quick game of backgammon?" 
"Sounds good. How soon?"
"Ten minutes."
"Ten minutes. Good. I should have my laundry done by 
then."
"Laundry? I'm not helping you fold this time. Bye."
"Didn't ask you to. Bye."

---------------------------------------------------

Thirteen minutes later they were having a pillowfight over 
the backgammon set, with the laundry left to wrinkle in its 
plastic basket. That deteriorated into an hour-long petting 
session of such fervor that there could be no disputation of 
"mood." Her parents knocked after half an hour, calling them 
down to dinner with sheepish, guilty looks on theirfaces and 
hastily adjusted clothing.
She always told him how uncomfortable he made her 
parents, how much they wished their only child were dating 
a Jewish guy instead of a Korean one. He stayed wary of 
them, Dad the doctor and Mom the professor of history, and 
they never met his parents (Dad the mechanical engineer and 
Mom the housewife) or his younger brothers. With all her 
warnings and all his wariness, her folks seemed to welcome 
him inin fact, sometimes he seemed more at home with 
her family than she was.
One night, fall of their senior year, her parents were out of 
town. Timidly, almost reticently, an idealistic boy as I imagine 
him maybe he's one of the rare remaining true gentlemen he 
doesn't want to have sex until he's married but we all know 
how the best of intentions he slept over. They were so 
terrified, and so discomfited, that they did almost nothing the 
entire night, and slept hardly at all. Only the next day, cud
dling together in bed, did they begin to play. He had brought 
a condom with him, but he was afraid to mention the possi
bility and she didn't say anything, so they both finished as 
they started, as virgins. Both stayed virgins until prom night, 
although Tom maybe his name's not Tom, maybe it's Joe Jake 
Mike Alan Rich Frank Don and maybe Tom went to a party one 
night and fooled around with this girl Vanessa in a bathroom 
okay so he's not perfect well who is anyway and felt really 
guilty and Vanessa wanted to do it right there, there in the 
bathroom, but Tom said no and he left and he never told 
Janice Alison Debra Joanne liana SuzyJean, anyone but maybe 
Janice, and she never found out.
He noticed that she left her socks on in bed, and it struck 
him as somewhat odd, but he never asked her why. He loved 
the mystery of it, the mad ordinary no-answer unasked Zen 
question feeling that he got when he looked at her woolcovered feet. He always secretly hoped that it was something 
strange, some peculiar fetish or a long-concealed injury. In 
reality, she had cold feet, but the secret mystery worked 
better for both of themhe had his spun-candy fantasy and 
she had warm feet without being bothered about her habit. 
She rather liked that about him. Other men, she thought, 
would make it an issue. Other men would demand explana
tions, excuses.
They rarely spoke of the future. They assiduously avoided 
the slightest planning effort that might extend beyond the 
next few nights. This peculiarity arose from a bad experience 
with a spring break vacation, planned months in advance, 
possibly involving a few unchaperoned nights together. It
consumed them with anticipation and second thoughts, so 
much so that it was eventually canceled amid a sea of re
criminations and sore tempers. (Disneyland was down a few 
rapturous souls that week; the accountants noticed the 
shortfall and chalked it up to traffic fatalities.)
That was almost their last plan, and their lives after that had 
an enjoyably spontaneous quality that they treasured, not 
least because it annoyed their anal retentive friends. Their 
second to last plan was prom, and that's already covered. 
Their last plan was for her to visit him at school in Pittsburgh 
in September.
So he's here, and the prom picture is his, and here she 
comes to visit, and all is well with the world, and yet the 
prom picture is left out in the rain, rescued here on my desk, 
giving the whole picture-perfect situation the lie.
Lacks consistency. Needs denouement. It's unbelievable 
now; there's no reason forhim to have thrown the thing 
away.
Let's be fair to Janice. They hadn't made any long-term 
plans. They hadn't promised anything. There was no ex
change of rings, no pledge of troth, although perhaps he 
thought that she'd just wait for him she thought he'd understand 
he attached more to the conversations, the long, meandering 
discussions, of what they would do and wherS they would 
go, and perhaps he put his faith in inappropriate things like 
the prom picture, a frozen moment of possibility, and per
haps he thought (as many young men do) that'first' is 
synonymous with 'only.'
When he called her, early in September, she seemed coy. 
"When are you coming?" he asked.
"Well," she said, "that's a little chancy right now. I'm pretty 
busy with school, and other things..." Her voice trailed off.
"Other things?" His voice had changed. Some emotions, like 
love, happiness, or contentment, are difficult to distinguish 
over the phone. Suspicion, on the other hand, is crystal clear 
at any range.
"Yeah, well, there's a lot of stuff; you know, school and new 
friends and all, and...there's kind of this guy..." She's gotten 
vague, he thought
"A guy?" he asked. "What about me? I thought that we had 
made a commitment. I thought we were going to be faithful." 
His disappointment was audible.
"My parents didn't think it was such a good idea for me to be 
going out with someone so far away."

---------------------------------------------------

"Your parents?" he sputtered. "Since when did you start 
paying any attention to them?"
"Since now. Look, Tom, I'm sorry about this. I really do like 
you."
Yeah, sureyou do. You don't give a shit about me."
"My Dad says that I shouldn't go see you. He says I shouldn't 
be getting that serious yet."
"How serious is he expecting us to get? I don't understand 
this, Jan..."
"He says he doesn't want me to visit you because he doesn't 
want me to get serious about somebody when it can never 
really amount to anything."
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Are you saying 
they don't want you to see me anymore...because you can't 
marry me...because I'm Asian? That's fucking ridiculous."
"Look, Tom, I have to go. I'll call you soon."
"But..."
"Goodbye, Tom." She pushed down on the switchhook for a 
few seconds, then carefully replaced the phone in its cradle. 
She got up and walked to the kitchen, where her father was 
making a salad.
"Were you just on the phone with Tom?" he asked.
"Yeah," she said. We're not getting along so well."
"Why not?" he asked, gracefully slicing a cucumber. "I 
thought you were looking forward to going out there next 
month."
"Well, I don't think I'm going, Dad. It just seems like a bad 
idea right now."
"Are you sure?" he asked, concerned. "I know how much 
you care about each other. Sometimes the shock of separa
tion can cause a few tremors, but that's no reason to throw in 
the towel." He offered her a carrot stick.
"No, Dad, it's more than that. We've been sort of growing 
apart for a while now... I think it's probably best if we don't 
see each other right now." She smiled wanly and took a bite 
from her carrot.
"Well, then, if that's how you feel about it, fine." Her father 
started washing tomatoes in the sink.
Yep, (crunch) that's how I feel (crunch)." She swallowed 
and took a cucumber slice.

kiss my ass I don't need her and I certainly don't need the

I took another look at my prize. What kind of betrayal could 
make someone throw their prom memoriesnot just their 
portrait, snapped by some moonlighting college student, but 
their genuine actual leatherette coated gold-tone embossed 
senior promenade memoriesinto the street?
Something horrible must have happened, yes? Something of 
monumentally bad proportions. It's only pure chance that the 
damn thing wasn't burned, or ripped to shredsit was 
thrown as hard and far as possible, a talisman of despair.
Of course, maybe they just dropped it.
I'm going to keep It for a while; perhaps, when the weather 
turns cold and the street bleaches with snow, I'll dig up my 
prom memories and leave them out as a mystery for some 
other curious passerby to find.
Or maybe I'll leave it here awhile, and think of what might 
have happened if it was the woman who threw it away.
The phone rings; it's my girlfriend. Leaving the picture to sit 
vigil in the mess, I go over to her room, knock on her door. 
She opens it and catches me in a hug.
I pull away for a moment and look at her face, at her light 
yellowish-brown skin and her narrow eyes, at her straight 
black hair. She asks meis something wrong?
No, nothing, I answer, and pull her close to me again.

I wrote a letter to my brother because I 
couldn't talk to him. I've tried in the past - 
tried to tell him why he made me angry.
He squinted. His mouth twisted, curled at 
the ends into fish hooks, as if he had just 
bit into something sour and couldn't worm 
the taste of it out of his mouth. So I 
stopped trying because he didn't want to 
listen to my problems - his problems. He 
lives fifteen hundred miles west.
At the top of a white sheet of paper I 
write, "Dear Brotherthe ink is thick; it 
soaks down into the paper and nothing 
can wipe the letters off. I tell him my car 
was towed - and that because I didn't 
know about it until too late - it will cost 
three hundred and twenty-seven dollars. 
But he knows I'm not asking for the 
money. At the bottom of the second page 
I make sure to write, "Love" and sign my 
name even diougb he knows who it is.

---------------------------------------------------

Nevin is high up on the rusty scaffolding, powerdrilling supports into cross beams of the high-rise frame.
I've brought his lunch to the construction site today he's 
too grimy to meet me in a restaurant over noon break. In 
ten minutes he'll climb down, hungry and tired but still 
willing to smooch. I watch the muscles of his shirtless back 
move, so unlike the flaccid white flesh of my husband's 
body. I sit the styrofoam cooler on the curb and wander 
away from the shrill scream of the drill. The construction 
site is interesting, unlike the legal office where I work as a 
secretary. The sterile smells and hushed tones there make 
me crazy. Lunch times with Nevin are salvation.
Five more minutes. To amuse myself, I place my 
face close to a hole in the wooden fence around the site and 
peer through to the other side. There are some children in 
the neighboring empty lot. At first I wonder why they're 
not in school, but then I remember it is summer time and 
not all kids go to day care like my Gracie. The children are 
playing. They are playing happily with one another. Each 
of them has a stick horse or a cowboy hat or a cap gun or 
feathers in their hair. It must be cowboy and Indians, I 
dredge up memories from my own childhood. I hadn't 
realized that such games still went on among children 
these days. Electronic television games, ugly, overpriced 
dolls and battery run gadgets were what kids played with 
now. Gracie would wither in boredom with these kids.
She mocks such games as this, insisting that I buy her the 
newest toys as soon as they hit the store shelves. And I do.
I know what the consequences would be if I refused. I pull 
my eye away form the hole and glance up at Nevin. He's 
on his way down. He'll be looking for me, but I want to 
watch the children. Their game relieves me, makes me 
young, and causes me to worry all at the same time.
There are five children. Four boys and one very 
small girl. The boys are Grade's age, I think. Six or seven 
years old, with healthy freckled faces and open, honest 
eyes. The two cowboys are battling to rescue the little girl 
from the Indians. She is placidly sucking a lollipop despite 
the clothesline that is tied loosely around her.
"Bang! Bang! You're dead!" One Indian clutches 
his throat and writhes in death agonies on the ground. I 
cannot help but giggle. A moment later he is back on his 
horse with a war whoop. Does Gracie even know about 
cowboys and Indians? I doubt it. Even at her age she is 
already too selfish to consider things outside the realm of 
right now, let alone things that could bring her no personal 
gain. Yesterday she said to me, "Mommy, tomorrow you 
buy me those white shoes with buckles, ok?" I did, of 
course. I am afraid of my daughter. She knows about
Motherhood

Nevin and I. Worse yet, she understands how desperately 
I don't want her daddy to find out. An unspoken contract 
has formed between her and I, ever since she caught Nev 
and I in an embrace. Perhaps if I hadn't panicked it would 
be all right now. But I'd taken her shopping the next day, 
explaining their importance of the secret and reinforcing 
my words with gifts and candy. The entire situation is my 
fault. Gracie picks up on things. She took this and ran 
with it.
The children are resting now. Indian and cowboy 
alike are munching M&Ms and talking. They wave their 
arms and make faces and laugh out loud. Gracie's laugh is 
sly and low. I hate myself for wanting children like these.
I know Nevin is looking for me. I glance his way 
again, then go back to watching the children. Nev and I 
could have kids like these. Except for Gracie. She knows 
she can stop us from being together, and she will. She is 
Daddy's girl.
The kids finish the candy and gather their 
playthings. The girl bends to pluck handfuls of straggling 
daisies from the patchy earth. The boys are walking ahead, 
but when they notice that she is not among them, they turn.
"Whatcha doing, Annie?" one yells, putting his 
hands on his hips.
"For Mommy," she calls back, not turning from her 
chore. Dropping their simple toys, the boys begin grabbing 
at flowers, too.
"Fran! Fran!" I pull my face away from the fence 
and look towards the sound of Nevin's voice. He's 
standing on the sidewalk near his lunch, calling my name 
and waving his arms. I can't help but smile and wave back 
as I hurry to him. Nevin's warmth and cheeriness makes it 
all worth while. I'll work things out with Gracie. It is hard 
on her, that is all. She'll come to understand and maybe 
even someday accept Nevin. If only I can keep her content 
until the time comes that Nevin and I are sure that we can 
make this thing work. Until the time comes that I can 
summon the courage to tell my husband.
"What were you looking at?" Nevin wants to 
know when I finally make my way back to him. I brush off 
a section of the curb and sit down.
"Some kids were playing over there. Cowboys and 
Indians. It looked like such fun."
"Oh, yeah," Nevin says slowly, smiling and 
rubbing at the stubble on his face. "I can remember many a 
childhood battle with those dirty Injuns. Mom make us 
quit playing when we got a little too carried away." He 
paused, pulling himself out of his reverie with a huge bite 
into his sandwich. "Huh, we weren't really going to let 
little Joey Bensen get burned at the stake," he added 
around a mouthful of sliced turkey. I laughed and swatted 
at Nevin.
"You're such a goof, Nev!" I really loved his sense 
of humor. He comes from a big family in the country and 
was constantly telling me funny anecdotes about his

---------------------------------------------------

childhood. He had a way of recounting a story that always 
make me envious of all the circumstances of his youth. I'm 
sure exaggeration was a factor, but all his experiences 
seemed so unique. I keep telling him that he should be a 
writer.
"So how's your day?" he asks, removing his green 
hard hat and plopping it onto my head.
"My hair! This thing is disgusting!" I snatch the 
dirty hat off in mock fury. "My day is the same as every 
day at work. I wish I could stay here and climb around in 
the sunshine with you guys."
"Fat chance, dearie," he says, wrinkling his nose 
and rubbing it against mine, "I don't want all these hot 
blooded and able co-workers of mine gawking at your legs 
and cat callin' and slobbering on the sidewalk. Uh-uh, call 
me jealous, Fran, but you is mine1."
"Oh, brother," I shake my head, but can't help 
grinning at his clownish words. Nevin and I always 
bantered over lunch. It was a time when we didn't discuss 
anything serious, namely the circumstances of our 
relationship. It was one hundred per cent happy hour, and 
I always had to drag myself away when it was over.
"Don't forget about this weekend, Frannie," Nevin 
reminds me as we kiss a quick goodbye to the blaring of a 
horn meant to indicate the end of the lunch hour.
"Okey dokey, smoky," I say. How could I forget 
something when it's on my mind twenty-four hours a day?
On my way home from work I stop at the 
Children's Tree House and buy Gracie the white shoes with 
buckles. They are cheap, plastic imitations of patent leather 
and I know they will fall apart as soon as Gracie sloshes 
through a puddle. The sales clerk wraps and boxes them, 
calling me by name as he wishes me a good day. I 
suddenly realize that I have been visiting the local 
children's stores frequently, and it is no wonder that the 
sales people know me by name. I must be a favorite 
customer, for I've been receiving rapid and overly 
courteous service of late. This treatment gives me an 
uneasy feeling in my stomach, and I wonder if the 
employees see me as some doting mother catering to her 
precious little girl. As I leave the Treehouse, I decide that it 
would not hurt to do more of my shopping downtown.
Gracie is waiting for me on the cement steps of the 
center when I arrive. She hates it when I am late picking 
her up. The supervisor of the center is waiting with her, as 
is the policy when a parent fails to show up on time. It 
makes me nervous that she and Gracie are engaged in an 
intent conversation. I can't help but worry about what 
might come out of Grade's mouth when she is upset with 
me and in the company of others. As I approach, smiling 
in what I hope to be a motherly fashion, Gracie jumps up 
and rims to me.
"Hi Mommy. Where were you? I had to wait with 
Miss Elliot again."
"I'm sorry, babydoll. We can go right now." I take 
her little plump hand and thank Miss Elliot for waiting.
"It's really no problem, Mrs. Wells," she replies. 
"Gracie is a sweet young lady. Quite interesting 
company." Her words make me more uncomfortable, and 
I readily give in to Gracie's insistent tugging.
"Did you get my shoes?" Grace wants to know as 
soon as we get to the car.
"Yep. In the bag on the front seat/' I tell her. She 
wastes no time in unwrapping the package and kicking off 
her sneakers to make room on her feet for the shiny new 
shoes.
"Goody, goody, goody! I knew you were getting 
these, that's wiry I didn't care about waiting so much."
"Buckle up, kiddo. And don't you think you 
should save those for dress-up?"
"No. I want to wear them now, for just a little. We 
can shop this weekend for a dress to go with them, can't we 
Mommy?" She turned her attention from the shoes and 
stared at me as I drove. I had planned to spend the 
weekend with Nevin, telling my husband that I had work 
to do at the office.
"Mommy!"
"Sure, Gracie. Saturday morning we can shop."
"Okay. But only after cartoons."
I barely had time to start dinner before Carl 
slouched in the front door. He works as an investment 
banker in the dty, and, although he makes a great amount 
of money, I hate that he is paunchy and soft from sitting 
behind a desk all day. He rolls his eyes in disgust when I 
suggest that he join the health dub with me.
"I want to relax in the evenings and on weekends," 
he explains in a strained tone every time I mention it to 
him. "Besides, I don't have enough time to spend with 
Gracie as it is. I'm not that bad, am I, Fran? There's just 
more of me to love!" God how I loathe that cliche! But I 
tried not to nag him about his looks. And since meeting 
Nevin, I barely mention it to him at all. Even sex with Carl, 
which used to repulse me to no end, has become tolerable. 
The least I can do for my husband is make him feel good in 
bed, and he doesn't know who is on my mind as he 
clutches at me and nearly suffocates me and fancies that he 
is pleasing his wife.
"How're my girls?" Carl booms first thing. I give 
him a weary kiss on the cheek. I can hear Gracie squeal 
from the living room where she is watching Family Feud. In 
two seconds flat she has scampered into the kitchen and 
flung herself around her daddy's knees. Carl picks her up 
and begins the wrestling sessions that prelude dinner every 
night. It wouldn't kill Carl to set the table for me. I work 
nearly as hard as he does every day, and it's a drag to have 
to prepare dinner to boot. When Nevin and I make dinner 
together, we split the work. It's no chore at all that way.
As usual, I've had to prepare three separate dishes.

---------------------------------------------------

Carl will only eat steak or baked chicken or spaghetti; 
tonight it's spaghetti. I hate spaghetti, so I'm having a 
hamburger. Gracie eats to satisfy her whims, and she's 
decided on Jimmy Dean's mini sausage sandwiches. Her 
eating habits are terrible. She'll pick at her dinner and then 
retire to the living room with a box of Twinkies. Carl 
doesn't seem to notice, or else he's decided to let his 
precious have her way. I worry that Gracie will be fat and 
have a mouth full of cavities. She rarely exercises, and 
getting her to brush her teeth before going to bed is a losing 
battle. For now she is petite and graceful and has gorgeous 
teeth, but if she turns out to be a gross teenager, I will feel 
fully responsible.
I am left with the dirty dishes. Carl has gone to 
meet some friends at a bar on the corner. I hate it when he 
drinks, for it means that sex will be longer than usual. I'm 
glad that he's gone, though. I'll have time to call Nevin 
and talk to him in peace. I almost always call Nevin in the 
evenings. Carl usually settles onto the couch after the 
evening news and takes a nap. I wait until Gracie has 
begun practicing her piano lessons before I lock myself in 
my bedroom and dial Nevin's number. He always sounds 
so happy to hear my voice, and the half hour or so I spend 
talking to him is almost at wonderful as our lunchtimes 
except that I can't see or touch him.
My affair with Nevin began six months ago when I 
met him at Carl's company's annual Christmas party. At 
the time, Nevin was dating the best friend of one of the 
company's secretaries. Both Carl and the secretary were 
busy socializing and getting drunk, and Nevin and I had 
found company in our mutual discomfort at the party. It's 
amazing how two perfect strangers can be drawn to one 
another with so few words between them. We have a lot in 
common, sure, but that isn't enough to complete an 
attraction. I think I saw in Nevin what I had in mind when 
I thought about marriage as a college studenta nice, 
solid, good-looking young man who could keep romance 
alive in the face of what my professors called the "real 
world." Despite these notions, I'd married Carl a year after 
graduation, chalking my marriage dreams up to the ideals 
of immaturity and going after the security that I thought a 
businessman like Carl could provide. The suspension of 
these childish ideals never really bothered me for the past 
nine years, but even the responsibilities of motherhood and 
a career fell to the wayside when I realized that my 
marriage was not making me happy. There was just no 
warmth, no spontaneity. The routine became depressing. 
An affair was the farthest thing from my mind, but I didn't 
think twice when Nevin offered me his phone number at 
the close of the party that night. It was like tossing a rope 
to a drowning manhe's not likely to toss it back.
Developing a relationship with Nevin really wasn't 
too difficult. Carl is something of a dolt. It is not that he 
trusts me completely, there is just not room in his 
investment-banker, money-making head for thoughts on
how his wife might be discontent. To him, there is no 
reason for my dissatisfaction, no reason for me to seek 
happiness elsewhere. Besides, Carl spends little time 
around the house on weekends. His job keeps him on the 
road constantly, and he's a bit of a workaholic when it 
comes to business. If he's not flying off to out of state 
conventions, he's bar hopping with his buddies. About 
once a month he takes Gracie to his brother's home for 
weekend visits. All in all, I haven't had to work too hard at 
hiding this thing. For all I know, he could be having an 
affair. I can't take that possibility even remotely serious, 
though; imagining Carl possessing enough passion in his 
bones to conduct an affair floors me.
I probably would have left Carl months ago, when 
I first fell in love with Nevin, except that eight years of 
marriage has a way of grinding a body into a routine that 
quickly becomes a rut. Unfortunately, a rut can become 
somewhat of a crutch. Having financial security, a nice 
house and money to spare is just so darned convenient. 
Nevin makes enough as a construction worker to live 
comfortably on his own, but shouldering the 
responsibilities of a family would stretch his wallet. 
Besides, I can't get thoughts of what a divorce would do to 
Gracie out of my mind. Every time I read an magazine 
article about the psychologically damaging effects of 
divorce, I vow that, at any cost, I will protect my little girl 
from that type of trauma. There just has to be gentler ways 
out. For now, the circumstances make it simple enough to 
skirt action.
I guess I never entertained the thought that Gracie 
would be the one to throw a monkey wrench into the affair. 
I had underestimated the cunning of my six year old 
daughter. I feel horrible that she understands what I am 
doing, that she picked up right away on my betrayal to her 
father. A six year old can't understand the unhappiness 
that a marriage like mine can create. At least that's how I 
rationalized not ending the affair when Gracie found out.
In reality, I thought I could handle my daughter. It didn't 
make sense to me to give up Nevin when Gracie would 
probably forget the entire thing within a few days. She 
didn't forget. She became more aware of everything I did. 
She knows that I still see Nevin, that I am lying to Carl 
when I say I'm going to the office on Saturdays. She knows 
that I feel guilty, and that I'm afraid. But there is nothing I 
can do about that now, except give her what she wants in 
return for the safety of my secret. It's like sex with Carl 
it's the least I can do in return for shaking up a little girl's 
faith in her mother.
Nevin and I had barely said our hellos and I-missyous when an irritated pounding erupted on my bedroom 
door.
"Mommy, let me in. I need you to read me a 
story," Gracie whined from the other side.
"Nevin, I have to go. Gracie needs me. I'll try to 
call you later."

---------------------------------------------------

"Fran, your daughter is spoiled. Tell her you're 
busy." Nevin knows about the situation with Gracie, and 
he's none too pleased about a six year old "blackmailing 
her own mother," as he puts it. I can understand his 
frustration, and he tries to understand my need to placate 
Gracie, but sometimes he loses patience.
"You know I can't do that. She's been getting 
worse and worse. Let me go. Maybe I can get this thing 
worked out if I spend more time with her." The pounding 
on the door took on new vigor and increased velocity.
"God, Fran, is she trying to bust down the door or 
what?" Nevin sometimes found Gracie's antics amusing. 
"You better let her in. Call me later if you can, if not, I'll 
see you tomorrow at lunch."
"Okay. Love you." I hung up the phone and 
opened my bedroom door. Gracie stood before me, flushed 
and indignant.
"Who was that on the phone?" she wanted to 
know. "Was it that other man? Is that why you locked me 
out?"
I sighed. "I just wanted some quiet time, Gracie. I 
shouldn't have locked the door. Shouldn't you be 
practicing your lesson?"
"I know you were talking to him, Mommy. I could 
hear your voice. I don't like it when you fib to me. Daddy 
isn't here so you called Nevin." Her voice was flat and 
matter-of-fact.
"Okay. Yes, I was talking to Nevin. We are 
friends, I told you."
"You are bad Mends, that's why Daddy can't find 
out. You want Nevin to be my daddy. You wish you were 
married to him. I know. That's why you don't want me to 
tell Daddy about him."
"Come on, Gracie. I explained it to you a long time 
ago. I know you know. But it's our secret, remember? You 
promised not to mention Nevin to your father. I'm married 
to Daddy, and we both love you so Nevin doesn't matter."
I was always coaxing and grasping at straws when I had to 
talk to Gracie about Nevin. It felt so wrong to me that I 
had to even refer to my lover to my young daughter.
Gracie looked at me accusingly. "What would daddy do if 
he found out?" I'd explained it to her time and time again.
"Daddy would be very sad, and he'd probably go 
away. That's why it is very, very important that you keep 
the secret."
"I don't think he'd go away, Mommy. He won't 
leave me. He'd make you go away and he'd punch old 
Nevin in the face."
"Gracie! That's just not true! You can't..."
"Read me a story, Mommy. I want you to play 
with me, too. I'm bored. You better not always talk to 
Nevin instead of me or I will tell Daddy. I know you are 
doing a bad thing, but I love you so I will try to keep our 
secret. But sometimes I get mad at you and I want to tell. 
Don't make me mad, Mommy. I forget when I get mad." It
terrified me to hear such adult threats in Gracie's sweet 
little girl voice. I'd made a monster out of my daughter, 
not that you could tell from just looking at her. Her big 
blue eyes were the picture of innocence, and her thin 
blonde hair and frail body in a rosy pink cotton nightgown 
made her seem vulnerable, like a lost child in need of 
protection.
"Okay, I'll read to you and play with you. But 
don't you want to practice piano first? You have to go to 
your lesson tomorrow, and you know how Mrs. Mellon is 
if you can't play your songs." I desperately wanted to call 
Nevin back.
"No. I'm not going to practice because I'm not 
going to my lesson tomorrow. Mrs. Mellon is a grouch. I 
don't like her."
"But Gracie, you already missed a lesson this 
month. Your father and I have to pay for those lessons 
whether you go or not!"
"Well I don't care. And you can't make me go!"
She crossed her arms and stared at me defiantly. "When is 
Daddy getting home?"
I dropped the issue right away. "Not until later, 
honey. No, you don't have to go to your lesson. Mrs. 
Mellon is grouchy. Maybe we can find you a happier 
teacher, okay?"
"Okay. Can you read to me now?"
"Of course. How about some cookies to munch on 
while you listen?" I had to get Nevin and Carl and her 
displeasure at me off her mind.
"Nah. I want Twinkies instead." Twinkiesit 
would be. All the Twinkies she could eat.
"The little monster keep you busy all evening?" 
Nevin asked me over lunch in the park the next day.
"She's not a monster, Nev," I protested testily. 
"She's a little girl and she's my daughter and she just wants 
attention like any other kid."
"How much has it cost you this week to keep her 
quiet?" Nevin bit into the roast beef sandwich I'd brought 
for him. He wasn't being cruel to me, and he didn't hate 
Gracie. It was just hard on him having to play second 
fiddle to a six year old. Carl, on the other hand, didn't 
bother him in the least. My husband is anything but 
threatening.
"Oh, the usual. A new outfit or two. Shoes. Junk 
food. A trip to the zoo. That was sort of fjun." I really 
didn't mind spending constructive time with Gracie. It 
was something I should have been doing as her mother 
anyway.
Nevin laughed. "Why don't you bring her over to 
my place this weekend? She'd love Scout" Scout was 
Nevin's Spaniel puppy. "Besides, I kinda would like to 
meet the kid once and for all."
"No way, Nevin. The less reason for you to be on 
her mind, the better. The time will come for you two to get

---------------------------------------------------

acquainted. Besides, the last thing I need is her hounding 
me for a dog of her own."
"Hounding you for a dog, that's pretty funny, 
Frannie/' Nevin laughed. I loved to hear his laughter. He 
opened his mouth wide and his eyes squinted shut and he 
chuckled deep in his throat. When he finished laughing, he 
leaned over and smacked me on the Ups. He sobered up 
and searched my face with his brown eyes for a moment. 
"And speaking of when the "time will come," when is the 
time going to come?"
"Oh, Nev, do we have to go through this again?" I 
hated discussing the inevitable messy break-up scene that I 
foresaw between Carl and I. I mean, if my husband even 
had a clue that I was having an affair, it wouldn't be so 
difficult to tell him.
"Yes, we have to go through this again. It's been 
six months now. Don't you think you owe it to Carl, and to 
yourself, to get this over with so we can all get on with our 
lives?"
"What do you want me to do, Nev? Just 
nonchalantly mention over dinner one night, 'Oh, Carl, I 
just thought you should know, I've been having an affair 
for some time now and I think I want a divorce'? I just 
can't do it that way, Nevin. He doesn't even suspect that 
anything is going on."
"I just think you better do it, in whatever way you 
think is best. I'll talk to him if you want. I just think you 
better tell him, Frannie, before your daughter beats you to 
it."
Saturday morning Gracie comes into my bedroom 
and jumps in be.d with Carl and I. I'd had a late night at a 
dance club with Nevin and was feeling a bit hung over.
Carl thought I was visiting my sister-in-law twenty-five 
miles away. Gracie put her hands on either side of my face 
and shook my head to wake me up. I felt brass bells 
knocking against the inside of my skull.
"Gracie, come on, let your father and I sleep," I 
pleaded, restraining myself from screaming at her.
"It's shop, shop, shopping day, Mommy!" she 
sang out cheerfully. I cursed myself for promising to take 
her on Saturday morning.
"Don't you want to watch cartoons and have 
breakfast first?" I suggested hopefully.
"I already had a bowl of Fruity Pebbles, Mommy, 
and I don't want to watch cartoons today, I want to shop. 
Let7s go." She slid off the bed and tugged at my lifeless 
hand. The clock on my nightstand said 9:15. Carl had 
rolled over and was still snoring softly. Defeated, I crawled 
out of bed.
"Go get dressed, then, Gracie. I want to take a 
shower, then we can go, okay?"
"Okay, but hurry up. We need all day to shop." 
She was bouncing up and down. Damn, I had an early 
dinner date with Nevin. He was not going to be happy if I
canceled our six-month anniversary celebration. And 
neither was I. Usually I was pretty good about letting 
Gracie take first priority, but tonight promised to be full of 
Nevin's extra-special romancecandlelight dinner, soft 
music, expensive champagne, and slow lovemaking in that 
wonderful water bed of his. As I stood under the warm 
water in the shower, I wracked my brains to think of a way 
to finish this shopping before four o'clock.
I took Gracie to the downtown mall. The 
children's department was already packed with mothers 
and fathers and their slicked-up children. Gracie wanted to 
visit the toy section first. She already had collected almost 
every doll imaginable, so now she was working on 
amassing a huge amount of "playing house" supplies. Just 
two months ago I'd purchased her a child sized toy 
kitchen, complete with dishwasher and fully functioning 
sink. Now she wanted sets of pots and pans and utensils, 
as well as boxes of fake groceries, to stock its shelves. As 
we stood in the long check out line, arms laden with goods,
I watched with interest the purchases of the children and 
parents around me. The little boy in front of us was 
clutching a single brown teddy bear in one arm while he 
clung to his father's hand with the other. In front of him 
was a girl with her mother. They were intently studying 
the directions on the model plane that the girl had picked 
out. Behind us, a couple were laughing over their 
childrens' obsession with board games as they looked over 
the boxed Clue and Monopoly sets they had selected to 
surprise them. I was embarrassed by the extravagant 
nature of Gracie's toys. I know that people other than me 
buy things like this, but today everyone seemed the model 
of purchasing modesty.
After buying Gracie an obscenely huge ice cream 
cone at Gardner's, we moved on to the clothing 
department.
"Oh, Mommy! Look at these pink pants! Can I try 
them on?" I often wondered why she bothered phrasing 
her requests as questions. She knew as well as I did that 
she could have virtually anything she wanted.
"If you want to, then go ahead." The long lines 
and the heavy bags in my arms wearied me, and my 
patience was already growing thin.
"What is my size, Mommy? Find my size." I 
selected a six, and handed the neon stretch pants to my 
daughter. I wished Gracie would make all her selections 
before traipsing to the dressing room, but she insisted on 
trying only one thing on at a time. She had the gaudiest 
taste in clothes, too. I really didn't care about the money 
we were spending, but I hated to send my daughter off t 
school or day care looking like the latest candidate for the 
"Worst Dressed at the Emmys" section of Star magazine.
We left the clothing store two hours and five outfit5 
later. Exhausted, I readily agreed to lunch. Gracie chose 
McDonalds. I bought her Flintstone action figures to keep

---------------------------------------------------

her occupied while I slowly sipped my extra large coffee 
and nibbled at a danish.
"All ready to go home now, babydoll?" I asked as 
we finished up lunch. It was going on two o'clock, and I 
was thinking about having my hair trimmed before going 
out with Nevin tonight. I wouldn't mind taking a quick 
look for a new dress while we were at the mall, either. But 
I knew all this was only possible if Gracie was satisfied 
with her loot for the day.
"Nah. We got lots to look at still. Remember, I 
said shop all day. Let's take all this stuff to the car and then 
come back. I want to visit the pet store!"
"Okay, we still have some time," I agreed 
hesitantly. If I could get her to the pet store quickly and 
maybe get her a hamster or something, she might want to 
go home right away to play with it. I was desperate to 
finish this ordeal. I'd decided that there was no way I 
could cancel with Nevin tonight, and I also got the 
impression that Gracie had picked up on the reasons for 
my restlessness and was planning to do all she could to 
prevent me from being with "that other man." A 
resentment for my daughter and her schemes was building 
in my stomach, and I had to concentrate on remaining as 
cheerful as possible.
"They are sooo cute!" Gracie squealed as she 
watched the hamsters tumbling in the ceder shaving of 
their cages. Her face, pressed up against the glass barrier 
that separated customers from animals, was absolutely 
rapt. A twinge of guilt shot through me for my earlier 
bitter thoughts, and my resentment began to subside as I 
noticed her childish glee. I decided that I would surprise 
her and offer to buy her two fuzzy hamsters of her choice.
"Excuse me, excuse me." There was a disturbance 
at the back of the store and I could see the crowd parting as 
a man and his son made their way to the cash register near 
the store's entrance. The little boy's face was flushed with 
pleasure, for he carried a wriggling bundle of furry puppy 
in his spindly arms.
"She's mine, she's mine, she's really mine," he 
happily informed everyone he passed on his way.
"Whatcha going to name her?" one smiling 
customer after another asked him.
"Queenie or Princess," he declared triumphantly. 
Caught up in the atmosphere of the little boy's joy, I failed 
to notice that Gracie had completely abandoned the 
hamsters and was staring transfixed at the puppy. Her lips 
parted and her jaw set and she had the same "I want" 
expression that she got every time she makes a demand of 
me. Oh no, dear Lord, not a dog, I prayed. Not only 
would Carl kill me if I brought a dog home (he's allergic to 
animal hairs), I knew that there was no conceivable way 
that anyone in the family had the time to care for a puppy.
"Mommy, I want a puppy." The inevitable request 
came at last. I swallowed hard.
"Gracie, we can't buy a puppy, honey. They get
too big and nobody is at home to take care of one. I 
thought maybe you'd like some hamsters, though. Look, 
aren't they sweet." I tried in vain to turn her attention 
away from the boy and his dog.
"I don't want those stupid hamsters. Buy me a 
puppy." She grabbed my hand and began pulling me 
towards the back of the store where the larger animals 
were displayed.
"I want that one," she pointed to a white Husky 
puppy chewing on a rubber bone in the corner. There was 
no way that I could get away with toting a Poodle home, let 
alone a Siberian Husky!
"I'm sorry Gracie. I can't do it. You don't want 
that dog, anyway. He'll get big and mean. Besides, Daddy 
itches when dogs are around. He'll be upset if we..."
"You're lying! I...want..that...puppy!" Gracie was 
now red in the face and screaming at the top of her lungs. 
People were staring and shaking their heads. I know every 
one of them thought I had to be the meanest mother on 
earth. I hadn't been lying, but I decided to resort to it to try 
and calm Gracie down before she broke into a full-blown 
tantrum.
"How about we come back next weekend, then? Is 
that okay? We'll come back next Saturday and get the 
puppy."
"Noooo! Now, now, now!" She screeched and 
flailed her fists in the air. She took a deep breath as if to 
scream again, but a sudden look, like a realization, crossed 
her face and she quieted her voice.
"Mommy, you're making me mad." She said in a 
steady, controlled voice. "When I get mad I might forget 
and tell Daddy our secret. You buy me that puppy, and I 
won't be mad anymore."
I snapped. It was after 3:00,1 was desperate to get 
out of the store, my feet hurt, and my thin patience could 
no longer hold up against Gracie's bratty attitude and 
selfish demands. To hell with the secret, I thought. 
Grabbing my daughter by one skinny wrist, I dragged her 
kicking and screaming out of the store. By the time we got 
to the car she was crying hysterically and couldn't speak 
around her heaving sobs. She'd exhausted herself by the 
time we arrived at home. Carl, I noted with boundless 
relief, had gone out for the evening. Without even a 
threatening glance, Gracie fled into her room and slammed 
the door. I called a sitter, and refusing to think about what 
I might have done, I concentrated on getting ready for 
Nevin.
"You've got to end this, Frannie. She's turned you 
into a nervous wreck." Nevin pulled himself onto his 
elbow and looked me in the eye. We were in his bed, 
having a customary post-sex discussion. I reached over to 
the bed side stand and felt around in the dim light until I 
came across Nevin's crumpled pack of Winstons. He eyed 
me skeptically as I lit one and took a puff. "I know you are

---------------------------------------------------

upset, Fran, you never smoke unless you're really 
bothered."
I smoked in silence. There was no amusement in 
his voice now as he talked about Gracie. I knew what he 
said was trueI was a nervous wreck, but it wasn't 
Gracie's fault. I just kept digging my own hole deeper.
The date with Nevin would have been perfect, except as 
the evening progressed the tense feeling in my stomach 
turned into an absolute lump of clay. Would have been 
perfect, except that every time I looked at Nevin I saw 
Gracie's face instead. I didn't tell Nevin what was 
bothering me until after we made love. I hadn't intended 
on telling him at all, but there is no time in the world that I 
feel as close to another person than I feel to Nevin when we 
lie together in his big bed after sex. I finished my cigarette 
and snubbed it out with a sigh.
"I'm scared, Nev," I whispered, staring at the 
ceiling, my head sunk deep in his feather pillows. "I wish 
t God I'd let her get that dog. Now she's going to tell Carl 
about me and you, and he's going to find out that I've 
implicated a six year old, our little girl, in something that 
children should not even know about at her age!"
"That's what wrong with this picture, Fran. You've 
let this thing become an issue between you and your 
daughter instead of between you and Carl." Nevin's voice 
wasn't accusing, but hinted at rebuke.
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"Instead of dealing with your marriage falling 
apart because of us, you're concentrating on relying on a 
child to keep this thing a secret. An affair like ours is bad 
enough because of the hurt it causes between a husband 
and a wife. Now that you've allowed Gracie to get mixed 
up in it, you've got to deal with double complexities. A 
confrontation between you and Carl is inevitable, Frannie, I 
promise it is. This thing with Gracie is absolutely crazy 
you are gaining nothing from it."
"But Nev, I can't let myself put Gracie through....."
I wanted to tell him how I was protecting her, not me, but 
he put his fingers over my lips and continued.
"And, yes, you are hurting your daughter. It'll get 
worse, too, if you let her be the one to tell Carl. You're so 
worried about what a divorce will do to her, well think 
about what she will think when she's old enough to 
understand what you did to her and what she's done to 
you. You are so bent on preserving your relationship with 
Gracie through this damn secret, thinking you are 
protecting her when really you are teaching her about 
deceit and running away." Nevin's voice remained even, 
but his expression was almost fierce. He'd never talked to 
me like this before. "And that," he finished, "is something 
you should consider if you are so hellishly dedicated to 
being a good mother!" His words stung. He never talked 
about how I could be hurting Gracie, only about how I was 
putting myself through hell. I had to tell Carl. I would, 
soon. But all I could think about now was getting to Gracie
before she got to her father. I had to reconcile with her and 
get control of this again. He spoke, as if reading my 
thoughts.
"This can't go any farther. I won't let it. I love 
you, Fran, but I'm not going to be included in this stupid 
game that you're playing with your family. Soon there is 
going to be no way out that's going to let you get on with 
your life without feeling guilty every time you look at 
Gracie. It's got to end now, or everyone involved is in for 
more misery and bitterness than if you would face this 
thing now." He punctuated his words by getting out of 
bed and pulling on his clothes. I looked at the clock. It was 
almost nine thirty, time for me to be getting home.
Numbly, I began gathering my things. Fifteen minutes 
later I was on my way home without having said or heard 
another word on the subject.
The house was quiet when I got there. Gracie was 
asleep and the baby sitter was watching an old black and 
white movie on television.
"Was everything okay tonight?" I asked the 
teenager, suddenly fearful that Gracie's anger might have 
goaded her into telling anyone our secret.
"Well, yeah. Gracie went to bed right after dinner, 
but she was good and everything. She seemed really tired 
or something. Maybe she's getting the flu. She wanted to 
know what time your husband would be home. She kept 
asking me that, but I didn't know. He called about an hour 
ago and said he had to take an emergency business trip to 
Hollidaysburg. He said he didn't feel like driving home 
tonight, so he'll be back tomorrow afternoon." I thanked 
her, wrote her a check, then offered her a ride home.
"No, I drove, remember?" she said, looking at me a 
little strangely. I didn't remember at all how she'd got 
here, but I smiled and slapped my forehead, like I'd just 
asked the silliest question in the world. I checked on 
Gracie once, then went to bed.
Gracie ate her cereal silently in the morning. She 
didn't speak to me, but I saw her looking around for Carl. I 
wracked my brains for something to say to her, trying to 
act as if nothing out of the ordinary was going on. I 
decided that I definitely had to get her out of the house 
before my husband got home. I wondered what it would 
take to make up with her. The deep pout of her mouth and 
the sullen way she slouched in her chair made me realize 
that a trip to the zoo wasn't going to cut it this time.
Would anything?
"Get dressed, Grade," I told her cheerfully when 
she finished her breakfast, "we have to go somewhere."
"Where?" she wanted to know right away. "I don't 
want to go with you. When is Daddy going to be home?"
"He'll be here later. I need to go downtown for 
awhile, and I thought you and I could go go the park 
afterwards. You can't stay here by yourself, at any rate, so 
go and get dressed, okay?" She slid out of her chair and

---------------------------------------------------

went upstairs without a word.
"Should we get lunch and eat it in the park?" I 
asked Gracie as I drove. She didn't answer me. "Grace, 
what is the matter?" It was a stupid question, but I had to 
get her talking. Her silence frighted me more that her 
threats. She turned from staring out the window.
"I don't care. I'm mad. You were mean yesterday, 
and didn't get me that puppy. You didn't do what I said, 
and you made me really mad." Her teeth were clenched 
and her hands were bunched into little fists, but she didn't 
shout. Where, I wondered, did she learn to be so angry? 
Where did she learn to act so adult-like in her anger? "I 
don't want to talk to you, and I don't want to go with you.
I want to go home and wait for Daddy. I want to wait for 
Daddy because I am going to tell him about you and that 
man, that Nevin man." Right then I knew that there was 
absolutely nothing I could do to assuage her fury. I could 
offer her fifty puppies, and it wouldn't make one bit of 
difference. She was hurt, insulted, disillusioned, and, 
above all, hell bent on getting revenge on the mean old 
witch that was her mother.
At two o'clock, we headed back home. I'd gone 
through all the motions. She wouldn't even look at the 
toys and clothes in her favorite shops. The McDonald's 
Happy Meal I'd bought her to eat in the park was now 
pigeon food. She'd refused to respond to my conversation. 
She went along with me in quiet tolerance, knowing that 
eventually I'd have to take her back home, confident that 
her daddy would be waiting when we finally got there. 
What had begun as frantic prayers in my mind this 
morning had melted into sick, numb dread as we neared 
home. I couldn't even think about what would happen to 
my marriage after today. Thoughts of how everything was 
about to end prevented me from even planning on how I 
was going to react, of thinking about what I would say 
when Gracie ran to her father, pointing an accusing finger 
at me, telling him the facts about something that a six year 
old can't possibly fathom.
Nevin's battered red pick up parked next to Carl's 
sleek Mercedes in the driveway jolted every last thought 
out of my head and replaced them with a feeling of total, 
incredulous surreality. Gracie's gasp as she was flung 
roughly forward against her seat belt made me realize that 
my foot must have hit the brake with violent force. I 
turned off the ignition, but remained in the driver's seat, 
my fingers in a death grip around the steering wheel. 
Gracie didn't get out of the car either, but sat still, watching 
me and glancing inquiringly at the pickup on which my 
wide eyes were fixed.
This can't go on any longer, Fran, I wont let it......I'll
talk to him if you want Nevin's voice broke through the 
shock and echoed in my head. I'd listened to him speak, 
but I never seriously entertained the thought that Nevin
would be the one to end this mess, would be the one to rob 
Gracie of her triumphant revenge. I'd become so resigned 
during the past few hours that this sudden twist dislocated 
me from all points of what I'd come to accept as inevitable. 
Should I feel relieved? Ashamed that Nevin was taking on 
a responsibility, a duty, that was by all rights mine to 
shoulder? I had no opinion, no relevant emotion to latch 
onto and plan action from. Lost, I was absolutely lost. 
Gracie's voice brought me back to reality.
"Who is it, Mommy? What's the matter?" She 
sounded like a little girl again. I didn't answer, but slowly 
got out of the car. She scrambled out after me and 
followed a few steps behind me as I walked towards the 
front door. When we reached the porch, she suddenly 
darted ahead and bust in the door in front of me.
"Gracie, no!" I grabbed for her arm, but she eluded 
me and ran into the house calling, "Daddy, Daddy!" I let 
her go and stood for a moment in the doorway, then 
followed after her into the living room. Gracie was 
standing in front of the sofa where Carl and Nevin were 
seated side by side like the best of friends. They looked up 
simultaneously when I entered. Nobody said anything for 
a moment, then the silence was broken by a shrill wail. I 
jumped, not sure of where it was coming from until Gracie 
suddenly flung herself into Carl's arms, crying and trying 
to speak all at once. He hugged her, attempting to calm her 
down. I looked at Nevin.
"Everything," he said, "I've told him everything. 
It's going to be all right now, Frannie." His words sounded 
hollow against Gracie's sobbing, and all I could do was 
stand and watch my baby girl writhing in indignation and 
confusion. Of us all, she alone was truly wronged.

CAREER WEEK '9 1
Nader topples image of corporate hiring
ar ROaeRT WYNeR
Tartan Staffwriter
In the two decades since he 
took on the Detroit automo
bile industry with his accusa
tions in Unsafe at Any Speed: 
The Designed-in Dangers of 
American Automobiles, Ralph 
Nader has become known as 
the founder of the consumer 
rights movement in America. 
His name has become associ
ated with seat belts in cars 
and with other public safety 
issues.
Last Monday, Nader came 
to CMU to kick off the Toward 
Tomorrows World discussion 
series as well as Career In
sights 91 with his lecture, 
Exploring Your Options Out
side the Corporate World.
Exploring Your Options 
Outside the Corporate World 
is only one in a series of lec
tures which will continue 
throughout March. In her in
troduction of the lecture se
ries, Karen Litzinger, associ
ate director of career counsel
ing at the Career Center, said 
that one of the goals of the
series was to make [students] 
aware of how [theirl talents 
can be used to benefit and im
pact society.
Nader recalled that he read 
all the muckraker books be
fore he was fourteen. His 
dream of becoming a peoples 
lawyer was instilled in him 
during adolescence by his 
parents, who emphasized the 
duties involved with being a 
citizen. After graduating 
magna cum laude from 
Princeton University in 1955 
with a major in government 
and economics, Nader enrolled 
in the Harvard Law School 
from which he graduated with 
distinction in 1958.
In 1965, Nader published 
Unsafe at Any Speed. It has 
become one of the centurys 
most influential muckraking 
books, due to its indictment of 
the entire Detroit automobile 
industry for emphasizing style 
over safety. His attack focused 
on the General Motors Corpo
ration and its sporty Chevrolet 
Corvair. This book lead to the 
passage of the Traffic and 
Motor Vehicle Safety Act of
1966. Overnight, Nader be
came an American folk hero, 
the legendary David taking on 
an industrial Goliath. At a time 
of much social unrest, Nader 
proved that one man could 
make a difference.
After his initial success, 
Nader continued the fight for 
public interests. His further 
achievements include spear
heading campaigns that im
proved safety standards in the 
construction of natural gas 
pipelines in underground coal 
mining, which resulted in con
gressional legislation. In addi
tion, he helped establish the 
Wholesome Meat Act of 1967, 
which created inspection 
standards for slaughterhouses 
and processing plants.
Nader helped found several 
foundations to protect public 
interests including the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency, 
the Center for Study of Re
sponsive Law, the Corporate 
Accountability Research 
Group, the Public Interest Re
search Group, Public Citizen 
Inc., the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration,
Growing up corporate means that 
not once in your life do you say,
'We own the public airwaves.
 Ralph Nader, 
consumer advocate
and several others. By 1985, 
Nader had a hand in forming 
almost two dozen national 
consumer organizations.
Litzinger has noticed that 
private-sector businesses 
rather than non-profit orga
nizations dominate recruiting 
programs on campus. She said 
she realizes that the Career 
Center appears very corpo
rate oriented. She added the 
reason it looks that way is 
because those are the people 
who come to the campus to 
interview. Litzinger feels that 
government-related organi
zations as well as non-profit 
groups need to become more 
visible in order to attract 
graduating students.
The Toward Tomorrows 
World Coalition is designed to 
make these types of organiza
tions more visible and more 
attractive to students. 
Litzinger says, The Coalition 
is concerned that students have 
a balanced picture of opportu
nities and take their own val
ues into consideration. 
Indeed, Litzinger herself has 
taken the initiative to form the 
Towards Tomorrows World 
Coalition in order to increase 
student awareness of career 
opportunities available in gov
ernment and non-profit orga
nizations. The coalition is 
sponsored by the Career Cen
ter, Carnegie Mellon Student 
Pugwash, and the SUPA Ca
reer and Alumni Relations 
Offices. Naders appearance 
was underwritten by the Po
litical Speakers Forum Board.
Groups such as Student 
Pugwash, an organization 
composed of engineering stu
dents concerned with the im
pact of technology on society, 
suggest that there is an inter
est on campus in public is
sues. Associate Department 
Head of Engineering and 
Public Policy Indira Nair says, 
Many students involved in 
Pugwash are interested in en
vironmental issues.
SUPA Associate Dean 
Harold Miller says, Most 
SUPA students have interests 
in public and non-profit orga
nizations. He also explained 
that the SUPA curriculum 
focuses almost entirely on 
preparing students for work 
in government, non-profit, and 
consulting firms.
However, Naders appear
ance was aimed at those stu
dents who had not previously 
considered a career in govern
ment or non-profit organizaVoluml mll d.t8e1 7uCl LTLocal filmmaker employs passion with ease

Tartan Staffwriter
I started doing filmmaking be
cause I had a passion for it. Films 
get made for two reasons: either you 
have a lot of money or you have a 
passion for it, said filmmaker Tony 
Buba.
Buba presented the lecture titled 
How I Get By Without Getting a 
Real Job last Thursday in the 
Wherrett Room as an installment of 
the Presidents Distinguished Lec
ture Series. Before a standing-roomonly audience, Buba said, Its not 
that I dont want to have a real job; 
its almost impossible to get one. 
His father believes this is entirely 
false; he was quoted as saying, 
[Tony] goes to college for seven years 
and the lazy SOB wont get a real 
job.
When he graduated from high 
school during the economic reces
sion of the late sixties, Buba knew 
college wasnt the right choice for 
financial and personal reasons. Due 
to poor high school grades, the more 
competitive schools like Carnegie 
Mellon wouldnt accept him; he took 
several years to work at odd jobs 
from the National Guard to a factory
You get certain attitudes from certain 
schools. Here, you wear your CMU 
sweatshirts out jogging hoping someone 
will see you and hire you.

next caught a glimpse of Sweet Sal, 
a street hustler. He used this piece as 
part of his submission for work at 
WQED. However, the station did not 
like Bubas style of making the camassembly line. Said Buba, Its sort of 
fun to be paid by CMU to be here 
when they wouldnt even accept me. 
Not being admitted to a highly 
ranked school still affects the film
maker even now. You get certain 
attitudes from certain schools. Here 
at Carnegie Mellon, you wear your 
CMU sweatshirts out jogging hoping 
someone will see you and hire you. 
Buba did eventually graduate from 
Edinboro University with a B.A. in 
psychology, a degree he doesnt use, 
he claimed. We all know [it] is use
less, he said.
Buba then moved on to graduate 
school at Ohio University. The rea
son he applied? It had the cheapest 
application fee$5. During his first 
year there, he completed three short
documentaries, the first concerning 
his grandfathers shoe shop which 
was going to be demolished. In 1972, 
Ohio University ran low on funds 
and Buba could not find work as a 
teaching assistant. Despite this, he 
obtained his MFA from Ohio Univer
sity in 1976. After that, he returned 
to WQED to seek funding for a docu
mentary on the Wiggins factory and 
once more was turned down due to 
his lack of objectivity.
Eventually he found work as a prop 
gatherer for the man who taught 
everyone how to tie their shoes and 
button their sweaters  Mr. Rogers. 
This endeavor did not last long  
Buba was fired after he could not 
produce a pair of docksiders. I didnt 
know what docksiders were, he said.
Buba also held a job as a teacher for era crews presence known on the 
one year at the University of South- screen. Buba has a different view: 
era Illinois. Ironically, it was at this When youre trying to create your 
time in his life when he not only got own work, you dont need someone 
his first film grant but also went on dictating aesthetics to you. Its even 
welfare. Voluml mll NqN.1 7uCl L4
Buba then showed a series of film 
clips exhibiting his work from over 
the years. The first clip shown was 
about a man named J. Roy, himself a 
driven man who often quotes inspi
rational sayings. He stresses the 
power of integrity and reliance to the 
extreme. According to J. Roy, You 
were bom to succeed. If you 
dont, its your own fault.

Tartan Asst. Features Editor
This week, the Career Cen
ter kicked off Career Insight 
91, a nine-day program spon
sored by several departments 
and campus organizations. 
The program, which started 
Monday with Ralph Naders 
address on Exploring Your 
Options Outside the Corporate 
World and will culminate in a 
Dress for Success fashion 
show on February 22, pre
sented juniors and seniors 
with a Slice of Life on Sat
urday in Skibo.
Sponsored by the Alumni 
Relations Office, Slice of Life 
consistedofbreakfast followed
by a variety of alumni-run 
workshops from which stu
dents could choose. Among the 
topics addressed were money 
management, entrepreneur
ship, graduate school, and 
taxes. The luncheon keynote 
address was provided by Uni
versity Trustee and GSIA 
alumnus Benno Bemt.
The program was attended 
by approximately 200 juniors 
and seniors of many depart
ments and interests. As presi
dent of the Student Alumni 
Relations Committee (SARC), 
junior IM major Dave 
Stitzenberg cited two reasons 
for the large turnout. I got a 
better picture of what life will 
be likethe non-academics of
life, said Stitzenberg. It was 
also nice to see that the alumni 
really care about the future of 
current CMU students.  
Dave Namkung, another 
junior IM student, shared 
Stitzenbergs view of the 
programs success. It gave me 
a lot of real world information, 
things that I wouldnt have 
learned sitting in a classroom. 
Career Insight 91, although 
planned and coordinated by the 
Career Center, can certainly 
be called a campus-wide effort. 
Five of the seven colleges are 
involved in the program, as 
well as a large number of 
campus associations, such as 
the English as a Second Lan
guage Center and the CMU
Childrens School, each of 
which will be running a work
shop dealing with career op
portunities in their respective 
fields.
Debbie Mall, assistant di
rector of the Career Center, 
said, The general idea of 
the Career Center was to 
branch out and involve the 
campus community as well 
as some of the Pittsburgh 
community.
Its kind of ajoint effort: 
we wanted somethingthat 
would involve all of the 
years and levels and ma
jors of students, saidMall.

Bahai leader speaks to campus about New World Order
ar C.NoY v.NG
Special to The Tartan
The current wars and political strife 
facing our world are not necessarily bad 
things, according to Farzam Kamalabadi 
in his lecture Friday afternoon at Hamjjurg Hall. [Regarding] the New World 
)rder and the current world crisis, said 
Kamalabadi, changes in the world have 
Lpurpose.... [They are] not disasters, but 
signs of anticipation of a New World 
Order. Kamalabadi, a U.S. Citizen bom 
and raised in Iran, currently resides in 
Macau. He is a founder and chairman of 
executive committee of Macaus only 
international school, School of the Nafjpns, and lectures widely through a broad 
tfange of media on the topics of peace 
education and cross-cultural relations.
!As spokesman for the Bahai faith, Mr. 
Kamalabadi explained that the Bahais 
believe changes [in the world] are not by 
random. There is an invisible hand at 
work shaping the destinies of mankind 
which is beyond the control of our phi
losophers and politicians...., he said.
All the myriad of things in the world 
are part of one phenomenon  the fer
tilization and development of the New 
World Order, said Kamalabadi.
According to Kamalabadi, simulta
neous processes of destruction and con
struction are occurring in the world to
day. Even as the Old World Order dete
riorates through the breakdown of the 
political, social, moral and religious in
stitutions, the New World Order is form
ing. The deconstruction of the Old World 
Order, he explained, is very apparent 
and therefore receives a great deal of 
emphasis in the world view, while the 
development of the New World Order is 
a long, slow process which is more diffi
cult to examine.
To Kamalabadi, the basis of Old World 
Order breakdown lies in the limited 
loyalties of people. These are people 
who do not recognize the world as a 
united whole, he stated, but who persist 
in allying themselves with purely na
tional concerns.
The time of nation building has come 
to an end, Kamalabadi said. In the Old 
World Order, everything is separated.... 
The transcendence of the New World 
Order will show the interconnectedness 
of the world, said Kamalabadi.
In regard to the War in the Persian 
Gulf, Kamalabadi stated that it was a 
Bahai principle not to take sides in a 
conflict, since blame is irrelevant. The 
New World Order is inevitable regard
less of the outcome of the war he said. If 
the allies win, they will come to a collec
tive realization of the effectiveness of a 
united force against a single nation, and 
will further empower the United Nations 
and form a federation of nations, he 
said.
If the allies do not win, it will demon
strate that the world cannot survive war, 
according to Kamalabadi, due to its in
terrelated nature. It will be seen that 
war is no longer a regional disaster, but 
an international disaster, he said This 
understanding will also result in the 
unification of the world into one whole

Buba then showed a film called

The pice de rsistance was a 
work in progress about a town

to court and was resolved legally,

15 minutes, the audience was

Cult victim warns students of 
mind-controi techniques
By TRUPTI PATEL
' Tartan Asst. Features Editor
What is a cult phenomenon? Perhaps 
; the first thing that comes to mind is the 
| image of a transvestite wearing red lip1 stick and a black garterbelt singing out 
bizarre lyrics in The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show.
If thats a cult phenomenon, then what
- is a cult? This time, the most memorable 
image might be that of bald, tambourinebanging, Hare Krishnas decked from 
' head to toe in orange swaths of cloth 
asking for peoples money in the airport.
Indeed, these are the stereotypical 
images of cults in American society today. 
The average college student probably 
wouldnt even consider himself or herself 
a likely candidate to join a cult because 
cults are weird religious groups for freaks 
of society.
A seminar held in the Wherrett Room 
last Tuesday, featuring lecturers Rabbi 
Joe Levine and Fritz Knabe, addressed 
the issue of Cults on Campus and served 
to blast these stereotypes. According to 
Knabe, a doctoral student in the SCS at 
CMU, cult activity must be separated 
into two categories: everyday cult phe
nomena and destructive cults.
Everyday cult phenomena are basi
cally harmless and become popularized 
through movies, books, or other media.
A destructive cult is a group which 
uses mind-control techniques ... to en; force and establish the agenda of a leader 
and to make money and gain power for 
that leader, said Knabe. Theres noth
ing in there about what the beliefs of the 
group are ... a cult doesnt necessarily 
have anything to do with religion.
As a former member of a cult, Knabe 
. asserted that destructive cults are dan; gerous to be involved in and are actually 
quite prevalent in the Pittsburgh area. 
He cited one Pittsburgh group, The Fo
rum, as an active cult.
The majority of Knabes speech focused 
~ on his own experience with cults, the 
; practices of cults themselves, and ways 
1 to identify and avoid cults. I was in a 
. cult and I will be the first to admit... I 
was certainly one of those people who 
never thought it could happen to me.
Knabe explained that the cult in which 
he was involved, called Lifespring, did 
not fit the stereotypical definition, and 
was actually an organization he became 
| active in at the suggestion of a good 
friend. He had just moved to Pittsburgh
after graduating from Princeton Univer
sity and was adjusting to the new envi
ronment. In 1988 ... I was new to 
Pittsburgh; I didnt know people here. I 
was making friends, starting outpretty 
much what anybody in college just 
graduating and going to a new area would 
be doing, said Knabe.
Because of his own experience as 
someone new to the area, Knabe em
phasized that people adjusting to a new 
way of life or a new environment, such as 
college freshmen, are especially suscep
tible to cult recruitment.
Knabes friend told him that he had 
attended personal effectiveness semi
nars with the Lifespring organization. 
He talked about his experience with 
Lifespring with incredible passion and 
sincerity; I was really impressed, said 
Knabe. Thus, Knabe decided to enroll in 
the five-day beginners seminar, held in 
Washington D.C., at a cost of $450.
I came out of basic training, and my 
life was changed. I learned things about 
myself I had ever known. It was just 
incredible. I saw parts of myself that I 
had never seen before.... I was on top of 
the world. Knabe said. After the basic 
training, Knabe enrolled in the advance 
training program, after a great deal of 
thought, at a cost of $950. I came out of 
the advanced training, and my mind 
exploded. This was just a new me, Knabe 
said.
During his visit home over spring break 
of 1988, Knabes parents arranged for 
him to meet four ex-members of the 
Lifespring organization. This was when 
Knabe received the shock of his life. The 
four ex-Lifespringers produced large 
quantities of information including 
newspaper articles, television documen
taries, and magazine exposs revealing 
the cult persona of Lifespring. I learned 
that I had been involved in a destructive 
cult, said Knabe. I spent the next seven 
months trying to put my life and my 
personality back together.
Knabe commented that Lifespring is 
set up as a pseudo-therapy type of cult 
which coerces people into believing things 
contrary to what they would normally 
believe. In addition, Knabe analogized 
that cult indoctrination works like 
breathing carbonmonoxide. You dont 
know its gotten to you until its way to 
late. Thats the problem with cult indoc
trination.
According to Knabe, the manner in 
which cults compel people to believe their
tenets are quite complex. They control 
behavior, thoughts, emotions, and in
formation received. Behavior control is 
manifested by disallowing normal 
amounts of sleep, keeping people con
fined to a restricted area, allowing in
teraction only with other cult members, 
disallowing normal amounts of food, 
temperature control, and placement in 
an unfamiliar environment. All of these 
procedures are practiced by leaders 
within the cult without the knowledge 
of the participants.
Moreover, emotional control is estab
lished by the constant discussion of 
emotionally charged issues (i.e., things 
about a mother or father or persons 
past). Informational control is manipu
lated by allowing no outside informa
tion or opinions about the cult to reach 
the participants. Thought control is es
tablished through inculcation of dozens 
of new concepts, one after another, so 
that participants have no time to deter
mine whether they actually agree with 
what they are hearing.
In addition to these methods, small 
psychological tricks are utilized in or
der to manipulate participants. For in
stance, leaders of cult groups are often 
placed on platforms slightly above the 
general crowd in order to give the psy
chological message of having innate au
thority over others.
Knabe gave another example of one 
seminar of Lifespring in which mem
bers were asked to place their coats and 
purses to the side of the room, in a large 
pile. Several of the female members 
offered initial resistance to the mea
sure; however, Lifespring workers were 
trained to simply respond with the 
phrase coats and purses to the side, 
please and nothing more. The female 
members proceeded to comply with the 
demand. Knabe concluded that 
Lifespring can compel people to do things 
that they would not normally do, and is, 
therefore, a cult.
Knabe commented that current fig
ures estimate the number of cults 
throughout the United States at more 
than 6,000 and the number of active 
members at more than 3 million. Its 
not just one person here and there, he 
said.
Essentially, Knabe said that cults are 
detrimental for four specific reasons: 
they cut off communication with non
cult members, they force people to do 
things differently, they oblige members

Knabe emphasized that perhaps the 
most important thing to remember about 
cults is that everyone is vulnerable. He 
added-that the best way to determine 
whether an organization is a cult is simply to be a good consumer.  People should 
ask specific and direct questions regard
ing qualifications of leaders, their back
grounds, and whether anyone left the 
organization and why.

Nader continues to challenge corporate American hiring
d.t8e1 fPUM 7uCl Ln
focused on the need for an in
creasing awareness of the injustices that the government and 
corporate world inflict on the 
public, and on the need for more 
college graduates to enter into 
careers with non-profit and gov
ernment foundations formed to 
protect public interests. He be
gan his lecture by asking the au
dience the following question: 
How many of you here are deter
mined after you graduate or fin
ish your formal education, to be 
leaders of the advancement of 
justice in our country?
Nader also discussed the im
portance of choosing a career 
carefully. He noted that many 
people choose a career based on 
circumstantial factors such as a 
jobs availability and location. He 
stressed how important it is to 
find a career that is personally 
satisfying, one that allows you to 
take your conscience to work with 
you...said N ader. A lot of people 
m this country have made a lot of 
money and when they are 60 or 
r?0> look back and are disgusted 
with themselves. He advised that 
while students are choosing a job 
they must keep in mind that they 
will one day look back and ask 
themselves if what they did with 
their lives was worthwhile.
Nader then tackled the issue of 
injustices inflicted on the public 
by government policies and by 
corporations, beginning with the 
use of computers. He pointed out 
that computers are used by corpo
rations to obtain an unfair advantage over the buyers. While com
puters are terrific for inventory 
control, he said, They are also 
terrific for misleading people as 
part of a merchandising strategy 
to confuse, mystify, 
over-complicate, or outright de
fraud the customer.
He claimed there is a need for 
buyers organizations to balance 
out the unfair advantage of the 
sellers since consumers dont 
have computer technology to solve 
for them and instantly tell them 
what the cheapest and best insur
ance policy is for them. He also 
pointed out the injustice in the 
fact that corporations have ex
tensive legal services while most 
of the public cant afford to have a 
lawyer. Speaking from his expe
rience at law school, Nader said 
Harvard law students were 
trained to protect the interests of 
the wealthy and powerful. He 
continued to criticize the Reagan

and Bush administrations for an 
energy program which cut the 
solar energy budget by 90 percent 
and caused thrift and energy 
conservation to be considered 
dam-right unAmerican. The re
sult of their energy policy, said 
Nader, was to make the United 
States dependent on foreign en
ergy sources.
Nader addressed a problem he 
called growing up corporate, 
which refers to the idea of people 
growing up with a mentality that 
is too accepting and uncritical. 
He attributes this to television 
and advertising, which are aimed 
to turn people into Pavlovian 
specimens, so that we can drop all 
our critical capacities and be but
tered patsies for their future mer
chandise.
Growing up corporate means 
that you watch television and not

we own the public air waves, were
the landlords, the TV and radio

come they dont pay us any rent,

He fears that this mentality 
makes society vulnerable to govemment injustices. He discussed
a commonwealth in which the 
public owns land, airwaves, and 
mutual insurance companies, yet 
has no control over them.

Valentines Day takes on new meaning for jaded lover
Once again, Valentines Day has come 
and gone. While many see Valentines 
ijay as a perfect opportunity to blame all 
of the problems of the world on the few 
who are happily engaged to one another, 
I;decided to take an alternate approach 
tp the holiday this year. The most frightehitig aspect of my decision is that it can 
b!e .directly traced to the experience of 
hatching Def Leppard videos on MTV.
Ever since the possibility of romance 
entered my lifeand one of the interest
ing things about romance is that as a 
possibility it enters a persons life only 
once, but as a reality it exits time and 
tjme again  I, along with so many 
others, have made it a practice to hate 
Valentines Day. The somewhat hypo
critical reason for this loathing is that, 
for most, the holiday usually never coin
cides with the presence of happiness in a 
romantic sense.
However, this loathing of Valentines 
Day brings pleasures of its own.
;One of the most enjoyable things for 
people who consider themselves to be
JaviVision
__________by Javier Grillo-Marxuach
miserable on Valentines Day is to sit 
with other people who consider them
selves to be miserable and try to quan
tify their misery. Hundreds of anguished 
witticisms have emerged from bitching 
sessions like these  my personal fa
vorite is Valentines day for me is like 
Christmas for a Jew.
But honestly, hating Valentines Day 
is like blaming Colonel Sanders if you 
get a lousy piece of chicken. In truth, 
most of those people who claim to hate 
Valentines Day seldom get to enjoy the 
pleasure they seek from wallowing in 
their own misery.
A good friend of mine makes it her 
habit to protest Valentines Day. Her 
yearly protest consists of dressing up in 
black and hosting an Anti-Valentines 
Day party in which the viewing of the 
film My Bloody Valentine and the 
reading of existential poetry have be
come a ritual.
The most important aspect of holding 
a successful Anti-Valentines Day party, 
as my friend has done for so many 
years, is to bar anybody who is in the 
midst of a successful relationship from 
the festivities. Oddly enough, I was 
invited last year even though I was 
involved in what I perceived to be a 
successful relationship. It must have 
been my friends way of telling me 
something.
In any event, this year, my friend 
dressed in black once again and set up 
for her yearly protest of Valentines 
Day. She probably even got an early 
start on the day with some choice ex
cerpts from Sartres Nausea before 
setting off for work.
But honestly, hating Valentines Day is like 
blaming Colonel Sanders if you get a lousy 
piece of chicken.
Unfortunately, the misery in which 
she was so looking forward to wallow
ing was effectively shattered by the fact 
that she received a whopping thirty-one 
Valentines from her friends and co
workers. It was horrible, she told me 
once the ordeal was over, I couldnt 
turn around without having to be 
happy.
Another friend of mine, one who con
tinually looks forward to having a happy 
Valentines Day, found at the end of the 
day that someone, presumably some
body who claims to hate Valentines 
Day, had driven stick pins through the 
candy-gram he had received earlier in 
the day.
Upon waking up on Valentines Day, 
I set to the task of finding the video for
the Scorpions song Please Me, Tease 
Me, which I intended to use in a liveperformance later on in the week.
Although spending four hours watch'-'!, 
ing MTV with an index finger sternly 
poised on the record button of an 
unforgiving VCR would probably sour' 
most people on the concept ofV alentines 
Day, I found that the broadcast of the Def 
Leppard video for the song Love Bites 
held some form of significance on the day 
which causes such a strong division be
tween people.
Obviously, the song Love Bites does 
not represent an epic treatise on.human 
suffering. However, the broadcast of the." 
video was followed by a brief news item'

infamous and non-existent White 
Burger.
Throughout his travels, PA Bill 
drank beer. He drank all kinds of 
beer; American, Jamaican, 
Mexican, Australian, Czechoslo
vakian, English, Irish,... the list 
gOes on.
;Reported by The Tartan, 2/ 
14/91.
-T^he world grieved. Outrage 
reigned. Riots broke out. Women 
cried into their tissues. Men cried 
ii)to their beers. Mass hysteria, 
pjague, pestilence: the years of 
darkness began. St. Peter wept. 
Satan wept.
! St. Peter wept because God had 
put him in charge of the new bar 
iii Heaven. Being the first bar in 
lleaven, it needed beer. St. Peter 
needed someone who knew beer. 
St. Peter needed PA Bill, but PA 
Bill had not shown up at the 
P,early Gates.
;Fuck. I guess Ill call Satan 
ahd congratulate him on getting 
PA Bill for himself.
I And so St. Peter got on the phone 
to Hell.
| Ring. Ring. This is Hell, Satan 
speaking.
Hey, Satan, this is Pete. 
i Whats up, Pete?
; I just thought that I would call 
ahd congratulate you on your re
cent acquisition.
 Oh, you mean Wyle E. Coyote? 
I wonder how he liked the dyna
mite in his food.
; No, Butthead, PA Bill.
1 didnt ... oh, yeah, PA Bill. 
Hes a worthy contribution to 
Hell.
| Sorry, Satan. But I have to go 
now. My beeper is beeping. God 
must need another enema. I hate 
this thing. He can find me any
where nowadays.
; OK. Talk to you later.
; Pete hung up the phone and 
called on one of his most loyal 
sfervants, JohnMoocher. Moocher 
was the most anal-retentive, 
oversensitive, televangelist on 
Earth, until he was killed in a 
bizarre accident involving a toilet 
plunger, a huge stained-glass 
window, and a bag of flavored 
marshmallows.
{ You called me, St. Peter, sir! 
j Yes. I have a task for you. Have 
you heard about PA Bill?
; Yes, sir. The great one is dead. 
4- single tear runs down the cheek 
off Moocher.
| No, hes not dead. I just called 
Satan, and hes not in Hell.
J Satans not in Hell?
 No, PA Bill is not in Hell. 
Moocher started to jump up and 
down with excitement. So, hes 
on his way here!
; No. I dont know where he is. 
Satan said he was down in Hell, 
tjut he lied.
--So, where is he?
Thats what youre here for. 
Im going to send you out to find

&. WilliamBurky
PA Bill. You must find him before 
Satan does.
Yes, sir. And John Moocher 
disappeared from Heaven only to
appear on a garbage barge sailing 
down the Monongahela River.
Meanwhile, down in a comer of 
Hell  in the aptly named High
lander Cafe  Satan was talking 
to one of his most devious ser
vants, Adam Weaver, the mass 
murderer who killed more than 
40,000 chickens, fish, rabbits, and 
lemmings (which arent fish). 
Weaver was killed in the Pitts
burgh Zoo when several animals 
recognized him and drowned him 
in strawberry jello.
So, St. Peter hasnt seen PA 
Bill. I want you to find him. If you 
find him, Ill let you go back to
those Georgia fields. You know, 
the ones with all those small crea
tures.
I like small creatures. I like to 
wake them up with two-by-fours, 
so their tiny little bodies get 
smashed into itty bitty pieces and 
their undersized microscopic 
brains get on my really small 
shoes.
But, if you dont find him, then 
youll be the surprise ingredient 
in my next batch of Hungarian 
Noodle Bake.
When do I get to go?
Right now. A flash of smoke 
and Adam Weaver disappeared
from Hell, only to appear in 
Cleveland. Small improvement 
at least Cleveland doesnt have a 
Highlander Cafe.
PA Bills final beer review was 
found scrawled on the back of a 
Pittsburgh hooker.
Smells like beer, he started. 
This Samuel Adams Double Bock 
is not bad... for a stout beer. The 
bartender said that it was a sea
sonal beer.
What with today being 
Groundhog Day and all, I decided 
to try it. Its dark, has a nice 
aftertaste, dark head...
The rest of the review was lost
due to lack of space. The whore;  I 
thought to be the last person to ! 
see PA Bill alive, had this to sayabout him:
I never knew you could do thag 1 
with beer.

Valentines Day takes on 
new meaning for jaded lover
J.n1 frm Pa&e L4
lead guitarist.
Dont ask me how I know all of 
this about Def Leppard, but this 
js the band whose last album was 
postponed for six years because of 
a series of cataclysmic disasters, 
including the failure of four pro
ducers to get along with the band, 
the lead singers ongoing battle 
with disease, and the loss of the 
rummers arm in an automobile
accident.
The death of the bands lead 
guitarist has led it to go on an 
indefinite hiatus from recording 
its follow-up record.
With all of this suffering under
their belt, one would think that 
Def Leppard would have more to 
write about than the standard 
Why-Must-I-Be-A-Teenager-InLove angst and catharsis.
However, all that this demon
strates is that many are far more 
interested in perpetuating the 
ideal of what relationships should 
be like and how it is exactly that 
one must go on about being in 
pain when these relationships fail 
to work out.
So, it would have been nice if 
Valentines Day had culminated 
in the archetypal Gone-With-TheWind-Wuthering-Heights-IDidnt-Know-She-Was-BeautifulUntil-Her-Glasses-Fell moment 
that everybody seems to be hop
ing will happen to them. Of course, 
it didnt happen; most days it 
doesnt.
If I learned anything from 
Valentines Day this year, its that 
planning ones emotions is most 
certainly never as rewarding as 
getting to feel them. The realm of 
pop songs and holiday cards can
not compensate for the fact that 
sometimes things do not go quite 
as planned, and that ones happi
ness or misery on Valentines Day 
usually hinges on how much one 
manages to love during the rest of 
the year.
With yesterday's snowstorm, 
there is no avoiding that the 
February weather has finally 
set in.
How are you keeping the 
Winter blahs* away?

! After being the sole bright spot in the 
unspectacular My Blue Heaven, Steve 
Martin has returned to the winners circle 
with LA Story. Chances are you havent 
heard much about this film, since TriStar didnt publicize it as much as its 
qther pictures: LA Story may slip through 
the cracks. Thats a pity because Martin, 
who, wrote and stars in this filmrputs on 
his best performance since Roxanne.
\ But dont expect the Martin of the wild 
and crazy guy days. The Martin that 
shows up in LA Story is a more mature, 
and possibly funnier, reincarnation of 
the man who use to get his laughs by 
pretending to juggle cats.
I Martin plays Harris K. Telemacher, a 
wacky television weatherman whos 
living the typical LA lifestyle and loving 
it... that is, until Sara comes along. Sara, 
played by Victoria Tennant (Martins 
real life wife), is a British journalist 
whos in town to write a piece on LA life 
for the London Times. Shes so com
pletely un-LA that Harris naturally falls 
for her.
! The rest of the film tells the story of 
Harris attempt to win Saras heart. 
Helped by advice from a magical freeway 
sign (thats right, a magical freeway sign), 
arris pursues Sara while hes dating

ous eccentricities. Starring Martin, Victoria 
Tennant, Marilu Henner, Richard Grant, 
and Sarah Jessica Parker.
Sandee, a game show hostess wanna-be. 
The two relationships eventually lock 
horns, but youll have to see the film to 
find out how everything turns out.
When youre doing a movie about a 
particular major city, theres a danger of 
making too many inside jokes that no 
one outside of that city will get. Whether 
its freeway shootouts or the constant 
sunny weather, Martins script will be 
funny for everybody. And inLA Story the 
jokes fly at you fast and furious.
Although LA Story is definitely 
Martins film, he gets a lot of help from 
the supporting cast. The best perfor
mances come from Marilu Henner as 
Martins original girlfriend, Trudi, and 
Equal Justices Sarah Jessica Parker as 
Sandee. Parker, a relative unknown on 
the big screen, is a pleasant surprise in 
the movie; she even steals a few scenes 
from Martin, which is no easy task.
The only disappointment in this film

through his routine. No, the 
audience interaction did not 
work, and soon enough, one 
could predict just when Folkes 
would stage one of his pauses 
to get audience feedback.
With the mood properly de
stroyed, the show didnt have 
a chance. Audience laughter 
came more like a relieved re
lease of anxiety, as the dry 
spells between comic material 
got painfully longer and 
longer. There were many 
times when the audience sat 
quietly, waiting for the mercy 
of a punch line and, upon 
finding none, looked down at 
their programs to either find 
out what he was talking about, 
or anticipate just how much

shes all that bad, she just suffers from 
having to share the screen with Martin. 
Having a stronger actress play opposite 
Martin  Lilly Tomlins performance in

made for a better movie.
Cameos from some of Martins old 
friends are also quite noticeable. Rick
Moranis plays a grave digger in a 90s 
regurgitation of the graveyard scene from 
Hamlet, and Chevy Chase plays, get this, 
a famous movie star. Finally, for all those 
fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation, 
Patrick Stewart makes a brief, but bril
liant appearance as the maitre d of the 
trendy LA restaurant Llddiot.
Although it didnt get extensive pub
licity, LA Story is definitely worth a look.' 
Its a good romantic comedy on its ownmerits; adding Steve Martin in the 
starring role is just the icing on the cake.'

You dont hear of too many bands 
coming out of the Netherlands these days. 
Well, waste no time in checking out Ur
ban Dance Squads debut album Mental 
Floss for the Globe.
This band from Amsterdam combines 
all that is good from rock, rap, funk, 
blues, jazz, and hardcore. The bands 
influences include James Brown, Chuck 
D., The Beatles, Frank Zappa, Robert 
Johnson, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.
At first listen, one might think that 
this is just rap without much of the 
thumping, machine-generated music. 
However, the focus is on the eclectic 
nature of the music and the smooth de
livery of lead vocalist, Rudeboy. Magic 
Stick on drums, Tres Manos on guitar, 
Silly Sil on bass, and DNA on turntables 
contribute to the sound that has left 
radio confused as how to categorize UDS.
When they opened for Living Colour at 
Syria Mosque on January 24, Rudeboy 
expressed this dilemma to the crowd. It 
seems that their career has been a 
struggle in getting music executives to 
give their undefinable music a chance. 
Much of this is expressed on the album. 
No Kid shows how the bands music 
does not rely on the Top 40 or rap 
formula. This tune features the sliding 
blues guitar of Manos. Prayer For My 
Demo also features Tres Manos fierce

culty the band had in getting that first;

Big Apple takes a funkedelic style in;

make its mark in the music community; 
without selling-out to commercial sue-;

about enlightening music executives and; 
destroying preconceptions of what will; 
be successful and what the public wants. ;
The most accessible UDS tune, Deeper ;

from the album cut in that the bass line ; 
changes during the chorus and an extra; 
sample of Wilson Picketts In the Mid-;

improvement since the bass seems more ; 
cohesive throughout the song.
The eclectic nature of the UDS sound ; 
makes the album worth listening to over ;

 Though hardly in their heyday, 
Queen still retains a sizable fol

groups past works include such 
ubiquitous hits as Another One

these simple throng stimulants, 
and old Queen fans look back 
fondly on pieces like Bohemian 
Rhapsody that exemplify the 
groups trademarks: vigorous 
melodies, incisive, lively instru

lyrics that could be flamboyant, 
nostalgic, sincere, gritty, or just 
about anything, except tired and

Given all this, its kind of an 
unpleasant surprise that Queens 
newest album, Innuendo, is such 
trough-fodder.
Okay, fine, its not all that hor
rid. In fact, if some bar-code MTV 
waste product produced some
thing like this, Id applaud them 
for their innovation. But when 
you flip a Queen album on the 
stereo, you want to be bombarded 
by waves of majestic power. You 
want to bathe in the throes of 
apocalyptic exuberance. You want 
angels and demons to spiral 
around your head while ethereal 
civilizations rise and fall to the 
beat.
What you dont want is this 
album. All thats left of Queens

is sort of a vague residue that 
coats the few better songs. The 
occasional lapses into four-part 
vocal harmony seem strained and 
without conviction. And even 
when a stray guitar interlude 
briefly tugs your soul towards 
other worlds, it lets go with a 
forlorn sigh.
Despite its attempts to invoke 
inspiration, Queen seems so old 
and tired. One feels like the chil
dren of Namia, watching the oncemighty Aslan the Lion pad sul
lenly to his end. Some songs as
pire to the cosmos, but their di
rection and integrity gets lost with 
the luggage, making them bland 
and nebulous. And most of them 
languish here on terra firma, and 
stare longingly upwards. No more 
adventures with bicycles and fatbottomed girls. Just a sort of 
dreary, drained mortality.
So, what do you get for your 
money? If you root through the 
lethargy and soulless parades into 
second-rate eternities, you find a 
few worthwhile numbers. I Cant 
Live With You is by far the most 
reminiscent of Queen songs of 
yesteryear, with a colorful melody 
and the perfectly blending vocals 
that once rode the airwaves in 
their fairer days. Delilah is a 
fond, whimsical tribute to a mis
chievous love, although the effect 
is dampened when you realize 
that the singer is talking about 
his cat. Ride the Wind, though it 
fails to get entirely airborne, does 
make a few shackles on your neck
rise with dim interest.
But for the most part, the al
bum just lacks oomph. Its sullen 
and torpid. The titular Innuendo 
starts out as promisingly ominous, 
but turns out to be the standard 
embittered grumbling at societys 
decadence, as does The Show 
Must Go On. Most horrifying of 
all is Dont Try So Hard, a 
mournful commitment towards 
hopeless resignation. This from 
the proud gods who brought us 
the triumphant score to High
lander?
What we have here is a sad case 
of poets turned bar mitzvah band. 
The music world is packed to the 
brim with soothsayers, prophets
0 doom, cynical commentators,' 
and jack-of-all-pathos gloom-^ 
mongers who take great pains to 
inform us how miserable we are^ 
or at least should be if we have 
any sort of social conscience. Do 
we really need Queen to set sail 
down the river Cheese and become 
another droppingin the toilet bowl 
of contemporary music? I say nay.1
Though above-average by 
todays standards, Innuendo is a 
blotchy, pus-spewing wart on the 
face of Queens history, and I; 
would only recommend buying it 
if I were under coercion. Spend; 
your money instead on the Queen 
Greatest Hits CD and pretend that 
this album didnt happen.

Truth: one ofthe greatest myths  . . , ...... . ....... picky questions. offour celebrities, with the help ofTruth: one of the greatest myths 
known to man. Everyones trying 
to convince everyone else that his 
or her particular truth is the right 
one. This gets complicated, of 
course, when all these truths start 
conflicting and jumble up our re
spective brains pretty badly.
Television is one of the most 
blatant purveyors of truth: ev
erything from news to sitcoms to 
advertisements to game shows 
tries to sell (or, more often, uphold) 
a truth, a way of thinking.
This column explores the eter
nal question, What is truth? It 
also provides the columnist with 
an excuse for writing a fairly silly, 
and seemingly unnecessary, game 
show parody. What follows is an 
in-depth examination of a pro
gram so caught up in this stuff 
that it even has the word in its 
title: To Tell the Truth.
Three elderly men stand in line 
on a bare stage. The camera zooms 
in on the first one. Staring straight 
ahead with as little facial ex
pression as possible, he says, My 
name is Samuel Johnson. The 
shot cuts to the second man, who 
stares straight ahead with as little 
facial expression as possible and 
says, My name is'Samuel John
son. And then the third man ... 
well, you get the picture.
Thats right, folksits time to 
play To Tell the Truth, the game 
that figures out whos lying and 
whos being honest. Its a simple 
enough concept: one person is 
telling the truth, and two people 
arent. Its up to our star-studded 
celebrity panel to guess who the 
real Samuel Johnson is.
Host Alex Trebek, who can now 
be seen on approximately twenty 
different game shows every day, 
reads a description: I, Samuel 
Johnson, am a successful orth
odontist with my own practice in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico. Last year,
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
I was able to fulfill a lifelong dream 
by appearing on national televi
sion in the World Wrestling Fed
eration championships. Through 
the miracle of makeup and cam
era trickery, I gained several 
inches in height and lots of muscle, 
and I came very close to defeating 
Hulk Hogan. Oohs, ahs, applause 
from the audience.
Professional panelist Kitty 
Carlisle starts the questioning. 
She asks each contestant a ques
tion about what an orthodontist 
really does, anyway, and manages 
to appear insulted by each of the 
answers.
Richard Moll, whos actually 
pretty darned fanny on Night 
Court, asks contestant #2 if he 
ever performed surgery in the 
ring, laughs at his own amazing 
sense of humor, and makes a joke 
about putting a patient under. 
Laughter from the audience, but 
his 30 seconds are up.
Golden girl Betty White is next. 
She spends her 30 seconds 
complementing Johnson on his 
willingness to take a chance. She 
expresses her feeling that if we all 
had the bravery to go out on a 
limb and do something we be
lieved in, then the world would 
probably be a better place. Nice 
sentiment, but no time for ques
tions.
Now its Orson Beans turn. 
Bean, supposedly a comedian from 
the fifties, always tries to stump 
the contestants with technical or
picky questions,
#2, what are those metal things 
orthodontists put on peoples 
teeth?
Braces.
Very good; now, #1, whats that 
thing that wrestlers, uh, do their 
stuff in? (Pause, laughter.)
A ring.
Yes; and #3, I have a friend 
named George Johnson. Do you 
know him?
No, I dont.
At this, Orson nods and smiles 
knowingly just as his 30 seconds 
run out.
Wow. Now the panel, as well as 
the viewers at home, should have 
the information necessary to 
make an educated guess.
Kitty picks #2 because he looks 
like an orthodontist. Richard 
picks #2 because Kitty did. Betty 
picks #1 because he has an honest 
face, and Orson picks #3 because 
theres no way this guy could 
know my friend George.
Alex Trebek thanks the panel 
for their help and turns toward 
the three Samuel Johnsons. In a 
voice dripping with melodrama, 
he asks the question weve all 
been waiting for: Would the real 
Samuel Johnson please stand up? 
You could cut the tension with a 
butter knife as the three elderly 
gentlemen look back and forth at 
each other for about five minutes. 
Finally, contestant #3 rises. He is 
the real Samuel Johnson.
Applause, applause. He fooled 
three of the panelists, which 
means that each contestant gets 
some amount of money. The other 
two, it turns out, were pulled out 
of a local nursing home by the 
shows producers.
More importantly, though, 
Orson Bean was right.
What does the above dramati
zation (completely fictional, mind 
you) say about truth? If three out
of four celebrities, with the help of 
probing questions and keen in
sight, cant decipher the truth, 
how can any of us normal people 
figure it out? (I mean, I really 
thought it was contestant #2  
and not just because Kitty thought 
so.)
Some shows completely deny 
the existence of truth. Take 
Family Feud. Ray Combs leers at 
the camera. 100 people surveyed, 
top seven answers on the board. 
Name something you roll around 
in bed with. Number 6 is aardvark (two people said it). No 
chance for truth there.
But someday Rays going to start 
asking questions that used to have 
real answers. Top six answers on 
the board; we asked 100 English 
majors this question: Whats the 
square root of 25?
This goes beyond game shows.
If three out of four celebrities, with 
the help of probing questions and 
keen insight, cant decipher the truth, 
how can any of us normal people 
figure it out?
If a nursing home veteran can 
make us believe hes a wrestler, 
then surely Tom Brokaw can 
make us believe he knows what 
hes talking about. All too often, 
we unquestioningly accept the 
truth that televisions selling.
Think about it. Dan Rather, 
Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw. 
Three middle-aged men. All 
staring straight ahead, trying to 
show as little facial expression as 
possible. Simultaneously, they
5
say, Good evening. My name is,;.. 
Kinda scary, isnt it?
Which one of them is telling the 
truth? Are any of them telling the 
truth? What is the truth, any
way? Your guess is as good as 
mine. But maybe there is a way. 1' 
wonder if any of them know

populating the county jails. He 
pointed out how strong the em
phasis on women to create a 
better life for themselves was, 
and how this challenge was not 
emphasized enough with the 
male youth of the black com
munity.
Then he went into how he 
thought the problem could be 
solved, and it was advice that 
could apply to every family in 
America, not just those in the 
black community. Folkes men
tioned five key aspects of nur
turing and developing young 
men.
The first of these was the im
portance of religion. He went on 
to mention the importance of 
two-way respect between parent 
and child. He pointed out that 
respect for the child in the home
would deter a mistaken search 
for respect out on the street. Rein
forcing the child with positive role 
models was also important, as 
was emphasizing the strength of 
rules in life. The last of these 
addressed was teaching the child 
the value of romance, and stress
ing the difference between ro
mance and sex.
Supposedly, Folkes is turning 
his act into a major motion pic
ture, and he should, for his mes
sage is one that is not heard 
enough in society today. It would 
be a greater service for todays 
youth to see Folkes act and hear 
what he has to say than to absorb 
what some other Raw act would 
have to offer.
Looking at the program of the 
show, one can see how the rou
tines nicely gravitate toward 
Folkes final message. However,

Here! For the first time! Neverbefore published excerpts from 
Super-Producer Julia Phillips 
new book about the real Hollyid. (Actually, these are the only 
sxcskpts left after the excerpts in 
Fame, Spy, Rolling Stone, Es
quire, Ebony, National Geo
Volume85 Petroleum Market 
<kly, The Farmer's Almanac, 
an Akron This Week.)
As our story begins, Julia had 
divorced Super-Producer Hus
band Michael Phillips for being a 
cotiehead, because I want to be 
accepted as a cokehead on my 
0wn terms, not just the wife of a 
cokehead. We pick up the story 
at a, party for Barbra Streisand, 
hosted by Erica Jong. Julia is in 
the ladies room with seven other 
Coke-sniffing Hollywood celebri
ties, and they are discussing who 
sKould be in Speilbergs next film 
for Universal... well, well let her 
tell it:
"I'm pulling more blow out of 
my purse when I get this idea to 
buy the film rights to Lewis 
Carrolls Alice in Wonderland, 
with Goldie Hawn as Alice! Ive 
to have this book! Ive got to 
have-it. I bang on the stall. 
Someones taking an awfully long 
time in there. Of course, I could 
never stand Goldie Hawns hair. 
It was always dirty and she has 
B..0.
Lynn Velman, the ICM agent, 
suddenly swings open the stall 
door, and shes in there with Mark 
Stallman, the screenwriter. I once 
spent six months with Mark try
ing to get a workable script for the 
e . Fonda action vehicle for 
Martin Scorsese. I finally figured 
out Mark was more interested in 
my bod than he was in the script. 
I cant stand this idea that, just 
because women like coke, theyll 
do anything to get it. Not that 
Mark wasnt generous with his 
s. But I always had my own 
stash so I wouldnt owe any fa
vors.
Just the man I wanted to see!
JOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE-IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
I say to Mark. What do you think 
about Goldie as Alice in WonderlandT
 She wont do it, said Lynn. I 
never liked Lynn Velman. Shed 
take coke from anybody. But I 
kept my professional cool under 
the circumstances.
 Why is that? I asked politely.
 Because Ill tell David 
Begelman to tell Frank Vecsey to 
tell Mariah Wilson that its bad 
for her career. How did this bath
room get so crowded?
You cant deal with some people 
in Hollywood. I shouldered my 
way past them.
 Think about it, I said to Mark. 
At that moment I want Mark to 
love me, but I also want them to 
leave so I can sniff some nose 
candy.
Later I find some friends at the 
party and we gossip about how 
trashy Super-Agent Sue Mengers 
dress looks tonight. Shes talking 
to Jon Peters about hair. One 
time Jon cut my bangs and they 
still looked like they belonged to a 
dead cocker spaniel. Suddenly I 
decide I want to direct Natalie 
Wood and Elliot Gould in the 
movie version of Fear of Flying. I 
cant wait to tell David Begelman.
Mick Jagger shows up and asks 
me to go to another party with 
him. Up close hes ugly. I tell him 
I have to meet Richard Dreyfus s 
about a deal at Warner Brothers, 
but hes persistent. He looks like 
a monkey and he has B.O. His 
hair is dirty. I enjoy his attention, 
but I let him know I have my own
coke, I dont need his.
I continue to work on this Alice 
in Wonderland idea. If I directed 
myself, then I would cast Natalie 
and Elliot, with Dennis hopper as 
the Mad Hatter, and if Erica Jong 
would cooperate, we could com
bine the story with Fear of Flying 
and make it Fear of Falling. We 
need a sexually driven female. 
Not like Erica. She looks like a 
sow in heat. Shes never offered 
me any coke anyway. When I first 
met her, we really hit it off, but 
now shes getting snide and pushy. 
She wants to know what Im do
ing with her book.
I smoke a joint and head for 
the bar at the Imperial Gardens 
to think about what to do with 
Erica. I notice my T-shirt is tom. 
Maybe I could produce something 
with James Gamer. Why am I 
thinking about James Gamer? 
Because there he is, sitting at the 
bar with Chucky Cadwallader, 
the famous agent, producer and 
mortician. I wave to them, but 
they dont do coke. I dont think he 
has body odor, either. Im not close 
enough to be able to tell.
I look around, trying to find 
the ladies room. I would love to 
produce an Edward Albee play 
for the screen. Warren Beatty in 
an Edward Albee scriptis that 
a scream? I dont feel like sleeping 
with anyone this evening, but can 
you imagine Warrens casting 
couch?...
Thats all the room I have for 
excerpts this week, but Id like to 
add one thought. I could never 
figure out why Julia Phillips never 
became the great movie producer 
and director she dreamed of be
coming. Must have been brutal 
personal politics directed against 
her.
Speaking of acid trips, Soultaker 
just came out, starring the Sheen 
you always forget about  Joe 
Estevez, brother of Martin Sheen, 
uncle of Charlie Sheen and Emilio 
Estevez  as an Angel of Death

people and taking em up to heaven

screws up when five teenagers 
are supposed to die in a car crash, 
but their souls get separated from 
their bodies, and so the souls are 
wandering around the country
side trying to call the police, while 
the bodies are hooked up to life 
support at Mobile General.
Robert Zdar, best known as the 
original Maniac Cop, comes down 
from heaven to tell Joe Estevez 
that hed better get his hiney in 
gear and track down those souls 
and send em up to heaven, or else 
Joe is going to be in a little colli

Upstairs Theatre becomes affected by samma Rays and loses its home
By JAVIER GRELLO-MARXUACH
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Upstairs Theatre, which, report
edly, no longer resides Upstairs (the 
theatre company recently undertook a 
change of venue) has chosen to begin its 
spring 1991 season with a revival of a 
well-known, but oddly-titled play  The 
Effect of Gamma Rays on. Man-in-theMoon Marigolds.
_ During its original run, Clive Barnes 
- -of the New York Times hailed it as one of 
-the most discouraging titles ever devised 
tby man. Despite its 10-gallon-title, Paul 
-Zindels The Effect of Gamma Rays on 
iMan-in-the-Moon Marigolds has become 
'one of the most oft-revived plays of the 
last 20 years. Although Zindel claims to 
have gotten the idea from one of his high 
school students who responded to an

advertisement in a comic book for mari
gold seeds exposed to gamma rays, this 
was not the first or last of Zindels works 
to feature a baroque title.
In his career as playwright, novelist 
and screenwriter, Zindel has presented 
audiences with tongue busters such as 
Pardon me, Youre Stepping on m Eye
ball, The Amazing and Death Defying 
Diary of Eugene Dingman, I Never Loved
Your Mind, and My Darling, My Ham
burger.
It was, however, The Effect of Gamma 
Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, 
which made Zindels name in the theater. 
Even though it took eight years for 
Marigolds to reach Off-Broadway, the 
play went on to earn the 1970 Obie award 
as well as the 1971 Pulitzer Prize and 
New York Drama Critics Prize in Drama. 
Although 21 years have passed since the 
plays initial run, the Upstairs Theatre 
Production, directed by Brenda Harger 
and featuring the talents of several 
Carnegie Mellon alumni, promises to 
breathe new life to a play which has been 
hailed as one of the most significant and 
affecting plays of our time.
The play deals with the growing pains 
of Ruth and Tillie (played in the Upstairs 
production by Diane DeCroce and Rachel
Hutchins, respectively) who are the 
teenage daughters of a bitter and cynical 
matriarch named Beatrice Hunsdorfer 
(played by Mary Sheets). The play derives 
its title from Tillies science project in 
which she later concludes that some seeds 
die, some live normally, and others live 
on in a mutated state. However, this 
discovery doesnt lead to Tillies envi
sioned success, but rather, a major con
flict between Tillie and her mother.
Although both daughters are depen
dent upon their abusive mother, who 
earns a living by taking care of Nanny 
(Eileen Boardman), an elderly mute 
abandoned by her daughter, Ruth and 
Tillie struggle to gain an identity of their 
own  an endeavor whose success or 
failure depends on their ability to sur
vive and overcome what Zindel terms 
the toxic radiation to which parents
subject their children.
Given the play and the companys 
previous track record and the life-af
firming message which Zindel presents 
as the conclusion of the sorrows of ado
lescence, as well as its uncommon title, 
The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-onthe-Moon Marigolds should be very well 
worth seeing. The play opens its run, as 
well as the Upstairs Theatres spring 
season, on February 21 and will run 
until March 9 with showtimes on Thurs
days, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 pm.

tion. Perhaps it was a sense of 
dissatisfaction with a life that 
lacked the poetry of the art that 
had captured his heart. He felt 
shackled by life, for the writer 
had become jaded to the world 
around him. Though he found 
purpose in his work, he began to 
realize that the only thing that 
gave his life meaning was the 
ultimate symbol of how mean

So the writer and a friend went 
into the woods on a camping trip

Pump Up the Volume
Remember the good old teenage days, when you 
could go to a movie that made every adult look like 
an utter ass, and absolutely glorified the teen life? 
Well, Hard Harry is here for you!
Christian Slater plays the role of a displaced and 
depressed teenager who finds himself at a new 
school in a new town. His only release from the ohso-horrible martyrdom of teenage life is the short' wave radio his father gave him. With it, Slater 
' transforms into Hard Harry, an outrageous and 
fast-talking radio pirate who becomes something of 
a cult leader to the other students who tune into him 
:every night. This all comes just in time too, as the 
 poor students are being oppressed by a principal 
: Who ousts kids with low scores to make the school 
look good.
Eventually, things escalate as Hard Harrys 
popularity grows andit takes the FCC and the police 
(all horrible grown-ups, in case you havent noticed) 
to calm the rebellion. So if you enjoy watching 
Slaters notorious fits of insanity, or you want to 
once again sneer at the wicked monster that is 
adulthood, this is one movie youll want to catch.

Joel Schumacher, director of bOm vwqV25 $es1. 
presents a tough bunch of teen vampires who ravage 
a strange little California town. Kiefer Sutherland 
leads this punk pack of the undead, as they party 
hard, drink hard (blood, of course), and try to sway 
a newcomer, played by Jason Patrick, into the group. 
But the initiation wont be easy. Jasons younger 
brother, played by Cory Haim, has some learned 
friends (Corey Feldman among them) who know just 
how to kill those blood suckers, but they have to act 
quickly. So, armed with wooden stakes and garlic, 
this group of little crusaders tries to save the town 
and Haims older brother from the wrath of teen 
draculas. Schumacher has produced a slick movie 
with a few intruiging special effects. This film gives 
a new twist to a very old story.

Star Trek II: The 
Wrath of Khan
Considered by many people to be the best of the 
Jive bOks rs1E films, bOks rs1E cc also contains a key 
element which the other movies lack  a powerful 
villain. As you could guess from the title, Ricardo 
Montalbon reprises his role as the evil genius Khan, 
who originally appeared in the 1967 Space Seed 
episode of the television series.
The story goes that Captain Kirk abandoned 
Khan and his followers on a desolate planet, leaving 
them with no means to escape. bOks rs1E cc takes place 
more than 20 years after that incident and, as one 
would imagine, Khan is s1kwwa pissed! So when Khan 
gets his hands on a spaceship, he eagerly seeks out 
his revenge on Kirk.
Even though the ending is no longer as emotional 
as it used to be, considering the fact that we now 
know that Spock was brought back to life, the film is 
still great. In addition, we get to see Kirks ex-wife/ 
lover, their son, and in her pr1Sz11s5 days, Kirstie 
Alley as vulcan. Check it out.

When children do something 
wrong they learn from their 
mistakes and dont do it again. 
Its amazing how adults forget 
this concept. They do the same 
things wrong again and again
Rescinding an apology is worse 
than never submitting it in the 
first place.
How many times can you say Im Are you really crazy or are yon as
sorry before it doesnt mean shit? good as you say you are?
