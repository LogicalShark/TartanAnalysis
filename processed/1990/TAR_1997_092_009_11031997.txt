CMU prepares for accreditation reviewUniversity hosts 
career seminar
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Junior Staffiuriter
CMU began its accreditation, 
review this week when the presi
dent of Cornell University, Dr. 
Hunter Rawlings, came to cam
pus for a preliminary visit. The 
review is conducted once every 
ten years by the Middle States 
Association of Colleges and 
Schools, and determines whether 
or not the University receives fed
eral funding.
At [its] most basic level, the 
Middle States visiting team will 
look at the Universitys ability to 
achieve its mission, said Jeff 
Bolton, vice president for plan
ning and budget, in charge of 
managing the accreditation visit.
The review committee, headed 
by Rawlings, will look at features 
such as the Universitys gover
nance structure, faculty, aca
demic programs, student services, 
academic support services, facili
ties, and financial management.
The accreditation review re
quires the University to perform
a self-evaluative study.CMU has 
opted to combine efforts on the 
self-study with its ongoing selfevaluation known as the strate
gic planning process, which is 
designed to chart a course into 
the future for the University, 
Bolton said.
This week, Rawlings met with 
a selected group of student repre
sentatives to discuss issues con
cerning CMU students.
Student satisfaction and
school spirit were bigissues, said 
Cori Swinehart, senior in profes
sional writing, English, and an
thropology. Swinehart also 
brought up the fact that only very 
active students were chosen to be 
representatives. Not everyone 
likes CMU, Swinehart said.
Youre not getting a complete 
view of CMU as a whole.
Dr. Rawlings stated that the 
purpose of the University is to 
educate students, said Bryon 
Krug, student body president and 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major. If were the 
reason [why] the University ex
ists, then of course we should be 
included in the discussions that 
decide what issues the Univer
sity will address.
A students main avenues of 
discussion are the departments 
presidential advisory boards and 
target committees, said Mark 
Kamlet, Heinz School dean.
The purpose of this meeting 
was not to come up with solu
tions, said J ay Shankavaram,- 
doctoral student in architecture 
and president of the Graduate 
Student Assembly. It was just to

This Friday, CMU will host 
the fifth annual Creative Ca
reers Seminar, a program de
signed to bring students in con
tact with professionals from sev
eral different creative fields.
Organized by the career cen
ters of eight area colleges, the 
seminar features professional 
panels on advertising, print me
dia, radio and television, multimedia, graphic and visual arts, 
public relations, arts manage
ment, and film and video. This is 
Carnegie Mellons first year host
ing the event, which has formerly 
taken place at Robert Morris Col
lege in Moon Township.
Karen Litzinger, associate di
rector of the Career Center and 
career consultant for the Col
lege of Fine Arts, said this year 
the sponsoring colleges wanted 
to make it more accessible to 
more of the schools, including 
CMU, the University of Pitts
burgh, and Chatham College.
Litzinger said the number of 
CMU students who attend this 
year will determine whether or 
not CMU can continue to host 
the event in the future.
The University Center re
quires 50 percent CMU atten
dance for an event to take 
place free of charge, Litzinger 
said. If we cant hold it there 
free of charge, we wont be 
able to afford it.
Students planning to attend 
must register at the C areer Cen
ter and pay a five dollar fee. The 
deadline for registering has been 
extended to Tuesday at 5 pm. 
Litzinger said, as of Friday af
ternoon (the original deadline), 
90 students had signed up, an 
increase from last years 41 CMU 
attendees. The colleges antici
pate 250 participants overall.
Carol Brown, president of the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, will 
deliver the keynote address at 
the programs opening Friday 
morning. Brown has served as 
president of the private non
profit organization since 1986, 
and she is a former member of 
Carnegie Mellons Board of 
Trustees. In the past weve 
had keynotes more from the 
media than from the arts, 
Litzinger said. [A speaker rep
resenting the arts] is some
thing I was interested in hav
ing because Im the CFA and 
BHA career consultant.
Groups of professionals from 
the eight fields will each con
duct a panel presentation at 
three different times Friday 
morning, following Browns ad
dress. Students who have reg
istered at the Career Center 
have the option of attending all 
or part of it.
Litzinger said the purpose 
of the seminar is twofold. It 
gives students a chance to get 
career information and job 
search advice directly from 
professionals, and it provides 
opportunities for networking. 
For these types of fields, 
which are highly competitive, 
most people get jobs through 
networking, Litzinger said.
I think it probably most ben
efits students from the College 
of Humanities and Social Sci
ences, the College of Fine Arts, 
and Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts students because ... 
there arent people coming on 
campus [to recruit or interview] 
for these careers.
Litzinger said the program 
can lead to full-time jobs or sum
mer internships and help firstyear students clarify their choice 
of major. Because the empha
sis is as much on gaining career 
field information as it is on re
ceiving job search advice, this 
program is relevant to students 
of all class levels.

a whole.

Senate calls for

Student Senate unani
mously passed a resolu, tion last Thursday call
ing for a student vote on a 
referendum to raise the 
undergraduate Activities 
Fee 30 percent  from 
$50 to $65 per semester.
The campus-wide vote 
is mandatory according 
to the bylaws of Student 
Senate, which stipulate 
that any increase greater 
than five percent must be 
approved by the student 
; population as a whole.
More than just our 
bylaws requiring this vote, students 
are being allowed and encouraged 
to vote on the resolution because it 
directly impacts their lives, said 
Matt Phelps, student body vice presi
dentarid a junior in electrical and 
computer engineering who partici
pated in research for the proposal. 
Although we are a representative 
body, some issues are best brought 
directly back to the students for ap

Students elect new senators
Only 625 students out of the 7895 eligible voted in the Senate elections last week.
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
Anew batch of Senators was elected in 
the fall Student Senate elections held 
last week outside Doherty Hall. The 
Senate Elections Board will confirm the 
results, at the earliest, by next Friday. 
Student Senate will also ratify the elec
tion results at their November 13th 
meeting. If Senate validates the elec
tions, the new Senators will begin their
year long terms in December 1997.
All of the people who won were on the 
ballot, so I assume they will accept the 
seat. They can decline, saicLDanTilkin, 
a junior mathematics major and Elec
tions Board Chair.
I think theres a lot of new blood. 
Theres some experienced Senators re
turning. The new people bring fresh 
ideas. The old people provide experience 
with funding and dealing with adminis
tration 7." things that keep Senate running smoothly, said Bryon Krug stu
dent body president and a junior electri
cal and computer engineering major.
Only eight percent of the student body 
participated in this years elections. 
Of the 7895 students eligible to vote 
this year, only 625 actually partici
pated. The numbers are significantly 
lower than last semesters presiden
tial elections, where 17 percent of the 
student body voted. It is easier to mo
tivate students to vote during the 
Spring semester because people are 
interested in voting for the new presi
dent and treasurer, Krug said.
A large number of students partici
pated in last years elections because 
they were held twice due to process 
errors. The voter turnout increased 
from 7.5 percent during the first Spring 
elections to 17 percent for the second 
Spring elections. 
Whenever you have less than 10 per
cent of the voters voting, its kind of 
disappointing. The PR team did a good 
job though. So its not that the students 
didnt know about the elections because 
there was such a PR blitz, said Krug.
The Public Relations committee for. 
Senate posted flyers on campus bulletin 
boards, discussed elections on WRCT, 
posted a sign in the UC, and chalked the 
sidewalks on campus. As a new effort to 
inform the campus about election candi
dates, the committee out together a pam
phlet with platforms from each of the

dents agree with our reasoning, mo
tives, and numbers.
Part of Senates reasoning is that 
the Activities Fee has remained the 
same for the past six years, in spite of 
inflation and the fact that now more 
than twice as many student organiza
tions  69 compared to 33 in 1991  
receive Senate funding.
Senators arrived at the 30 percent 
figure based on the Consumer Price

U.S. stocks go on roller coaster ride this week
NEW YORK (AP)  The stock mar
ket roared back Tuesday from its worst 
drop since the 1987 crash, posting its 
biggest point gain ever for a single day 
and smashing the volume record with 
more than 1.1 billion shares traded.
On the day after its biggest point 
drop in history, the Dow rose 337.17 
points  4.7 percent  to 7,498.32. 
The Nasdaq stock markets index rose 
4.25 percent, beating its one-day record
lent of nearly 37 Dow points  at 
$99.44. The technology-laden Nasdaq 
stock market, which was down more 
than 4 percent at one point in the 
morning, was up 65.25 at 1,600.34  
just over 4 percent.
The market found more positive news 
in a batch of economic reports that sug
gested inflation would remain tame. 
The news left economists further con
vinced that the Federal Reserve would
gain set in July. After three days of not move to raise short-term interest
heavy losses, including Mondays 554- 
point drop, investors returned to the 
stock market with a hunger for endur
ing big-name companies.
IBM sparked the rebound by an
nouncing it would buy up to $3.5 
billion worth of its own stock. The 
news gave the market a dose of inspi
ration and made IBM the biggest 
gainer among the 30 Dow stocks.
As soon as the 
closing bells 
started ringing 
through the cav
ernous New York 
Stock Exchange, 
traders erupted 
into cheers and 
threw trading 
tickets into the 
air. It was the sec
ond celebration in 
an hour on the 
floor. Earlier, 
traders chanted 
Go, go, go as vol
ume neared 1 bil
lion shares and 
broke into cheers 
once the milestone 
was reached. At 4 
pm, volume on the 
NYSE was 1.195 
billion shares, 
beating the 685.5 million share record 
set Monday.
Traders who had arrived at the stock 
exchange with grim faces cheered as 
the prices went upward. Im smiling 
because I still have a job, joked trader 
Michael Galluchi.

rates at its November 12 meeting and 
probably not in December either. Some 
actually have started speculating that 
the Feds next move would be an even
tual rate cut.
Analysts, however, said it was too 
early to tell whether the rebound would 
continue. A market like this is en
tirely capable of trying to rally, turn
ing around and making another low, 
and then turning 
around and finish
ing higher. When 
a market gets this 
volatile, the me
chanics almost 
take over, said 
Charles H. Blood 
Jr., senior finan
cial markets ana
lyst at Brown 
Harriman & Co.
In all, stocks 
listed on the New 
York, Nasdaq, and 
American stock ex
changes lost $600 
billion Monday.
We are now in a 
psychological mar
ket, and predicting 
what support lev
els might hold and 
what might be a 
bottom is an exercise in futility, said 
Ricky Harrington, an analyst at Inter
state/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C.
With the close Tuesday, the Dow 
was still 760.99 points below its Au
gust 6 record of 8,259.31. As of 
Tuesdays close, the Dow was up 16 
percent since January 1.
Military ousts 
Zambian leader
LUSAKA, Zambia (AP)  State radio 
announced Tuesday that a military coun
cil ousted Zambian President Frederick 
Chiluba, the southern African nations 
first democratically elected leader.
A spokesman for the council said 
Chiluba would be shot on sight if he 
refused to surrender, and that all politi
cians should turn themselves in by noon 
(5 am EST).
There was no immediate confirmation 
of the coup, first announced on state 
radio at dawn.
Military figures at roadblocks set up 
around the capital, Lusaka, told people 
heading into town Tuesday morning to 
go home. A South African radio station, 
quoting an unidentified source, said 
tanks were heading for the city.
According to Zambian state radio, a 
military council overthrew Chiluba and 
all senior military and police officers 
had been ousted in the overnight coup.
We are here to protect people. We 
have surrounded the radio station and 
we are armed, said a man who identi
fied himself as Captain Solo on Zambian 
state radio.
The whereabouts of Chiluba were not 
immediately known, and Solo said he 
would be killed if he failed to surrender.
There are instructions to kill him on 
sight. He must come out with the Geneva 
flag [to surrenderl, Solo said.
According to Solo, a previously un
known group called the National Re
demption Council ousted Chiluba in a 
campaign called Operation Bom Again.
I saw an angel, and the message was 
the government had to be overthrown, 
Solo said on the radio.
The announced coup is a severe set
back to hopes for political stability in 
southern Africa, bolstered in recent years 
by the end of apartheid in South Africa 
and Chilubas successive election victo
ries after decades of single-party mle in 
Zambia.
Chiluba defeated longtime leader Ken
neth Kaunda in the nations first multi
party election in 1991, then won reelection in 1996 despite complaints of 
corruption and inefficiency.
Zambia, known as Northern Rhodesia 
before independence under Kaunda in 
1964, enjoyed initial prosperity until
Kaundas socialist-styled economic poli
cies and a fall in copper prices, one of its 
major minerals, devastated the economy.
Astronaut votes 
from space home
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)  
Talk about absentee ballots. Astronaut 
David Wolf voted via email from Russias 
space station Mir this week to become 
the first American to vote from space.
Voting... is more important from space 
than I ever felt on the Earth, Wolf said 
Friday. You feel connected to the Earth 
and to your country.
Wolf, a registered voter in Texas, re
ceived his ballot last week by way of 
Moscow from the Harris County elec
tions chief. The ballot included the Hous
ton mayoral race, other city offices, and 
local issues.
The 41-year-old doctor, who is one 
month into his four-month mission, said 
hes not counting the days until he re
turns to Earth. But he noted: The first 
day I pull into a Stop-N-Go and just get 
out of the car and buy a cup of coffee, 
thats going to seem like a great delicacy.
House mulls over 
nuclear waste
WASHINGTON (AP)  Despite vig
orous opposition from Nevadas lawmak
ers, supporters of a nuclear waste bill 
said Wednesday the government owed it 
to the nuclear industry to accept thou
sands of tons of reactor waste for tempo
rary storage in Nevada.
The House for hours debated legisla
tion that would create a temporary 
nuclear waste warehouse 90 miles north
west of Las Vegas that would be able to 
hold 40,000 tons of used reactor fuel, 
most of which is now stored at commer
cial reactors and defense facilities around 
the country. Most of the waste would be 
shipped to the facility by rail, with thou
sands of shipments crisscrossing the 
country. Critics have argued that trans
porting that much waste  even if it is 
in specially designed containersposes 
safety risks to 43 states.
Supporters of the House bill said the 
government has reneged on a promisemade 15 years ago to make available a 
centralized storage facility for reactor 
waste at commercial power plants.
The bill assures another 15 years 
will not pass before the federal govern
ment lives up to its responsibility of 
accepting spent fuel, said Representa
tive Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).
But enactment into law is uncertain. 
President Clinton has promised 
Nevadas two senators that he would 
veto the legislation, and the Senate, 
when it approved the bill earlier this 
year, fell two votes shy of the number 
needed to overturn a veto.
The Clinton administration opposes cre
ation of a temporary site, arguing that it 
would take the pressure away from pro
ceeding with a permanent underground 
facility that has been proposed for Yucca 
Mountain in the Nevada desert not far 
from the proposed temporary facility.
More than $6 billion has already been 
spent on studies on the Yucca Mountain 
waste burial site, but the Energy De
partment is not expected to determine 
whether it is geologically acceptable until 
next year. Even if approved, the reposi
tory is not expected to be.ready to accept 
fuel until 2010 at the earliest.
Unknown source 
spills veggie oil
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP)  Veg
etable oil apparently was the mysteri
ous substance that coated hundreds of 
birds in Monterey Bay, the state Depart
ment of Fish and Game said Tuesday.
Still being investigated was the 
source of the spill, which dumped C 
much as 2,300 gallons of the substance 
into the bay. The spill left a threemile-long slick.
Lab results indicated the gooey sub
stance was hydrogenated vegetable oil. 
Samples taken Saturday were still be
ing analyzed by the agency at two labo
ratories near Sacramento.
Since Friday night, the feathers of 
more than 400 grebes, loons, and surf 
scoters have been found matted with the 
oil. Authorities earlier said there was no 
potential harm to humans.
Fish and Game officials warned people 
to stay away from injured or distressed 
animals, which could strike out in selfdefense. They also asked that dead ani
mals be left alone.
Officials have not said how many birds 
died after washing ashore on several 
beaches along a 38-mile stretch from 
Ao Nuevo State Park to Pacific Grove.Chinese seal deal with Boeing officials for their largest aircraft order
WASHINGTON (Reuters)  
Chinese officials signed an agree
ment Thursday to buy 50 jets 
worth $3 billion from Boeing Co., 
their largest aircraft order ever.
The deal, which had been an
nounced Wednesday by President 
Clinton after a meeting with Chi
nese President Jiang Zemin, 
meant as much to the U.S. gov
ernment as it did to Boeing.
The elaborate signing ceremony 
in the lobby of the Commerce De
partment building was designed 
to emphasize the economic ben
efits of the Clinton administrations 
policy of engaging China despite 
human rights concerns.
Behind the podium was a map
of the United States with aircraft 
silhouettes in nearly every state, 
representing Boeing plants or the 
location of supplier companies.
Commerce Secretary William 
Daley said Thursday that the sale 
could be a turning point in U.S.- 
China trade that currently runs 
heavily in Chinas favor. Its a 
critical step in addressing our 
trade imbalance, he said.
Under the order, Air China will 
buy one Boeing 747, five 757s, 
eight 777s, and thirty-six 737 air
craft and distribute them to vari
ous state airlines. Boeing charac
terized all the orders as firm 
commitments, not options.
Engines for the 737s will be
built by CFMI, a joint venture 
between General Electric Co. and 
SNECMA of France. Engines for 
the remaining 14 planes would be 
decided later, Boeing officials said.
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit 
told reporters after the ceremony 
that all 50 planes would be deliv
ered over the next three years 
and that most payments would 
occur on delivery.
Despite Boeings recent prob
lems in matching its production to 
its large number of orders, Condit 
dismissed questions on the mat
ter. Thats not an issue, he said.
He was also optimistic of addi
tional orders from China. They 
have a very rapidly growing avia
tion business, he said. There 
will be more airplanes.
The Commerce Department 
said industry estimates were that 
China would spend $124 billion 
on the aerospace sector over the 
next 20 years.
This is a great moment, Condit 
said just ahead of the signing. 
Open trade among nations would 
be the key to Boeings success in 
the coming century, he said.
Chen Guangyi, minister of 
Chinas civil aviation authority, 
said, through a translator, it 
would establish a constructive 
partnership to further the strate
gic relations between our two 
countries into the 21st century.

50 YEARS AGO, December 9, 
1947  An all-school election to 
elect members of Student Coun
cil for the coming spring and fall 
semesters was to be held Decem
ber 18. There were a total of 18 
positions to be filled at this elec
tion. Following the election, Stu
dent Council was to be composed 
of 37 voting members and four 
non-voting members. Polling 
places for the elections in 1947 
were at the main entrance of 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col
lege and at the front end of Ad
ministration Hall, later to become 
Baker Hall.
25 YEARS AGO, November 7, 
1972  The pinball machines 
were removed from the entrance 
of the Tartan Grill, which lead to 
some controversy as to what the 
plans might be for the future reno
vation of the restaurant. The Ac
tivities Board, which had leased 
the machines from Food Services, 
was ordered to move them by 
Operations. The Student Senate 
had objected that they were never 
consulted and that the action 
taken would affect them finan
cially. The argument for removal 
of the machines was that many of 
the patrons of the machines were 
under 16 and caused a problem 
for the management at closing 
time. In addition, the jukebox was 
also removed from service at the 
Tartan Grill.
10 YEARS AGO,November 3, 
1987  The Interfraternity In
vestigative Committee submitted 
a report to the Interfraternity 
Council concerning the actions of 
Alpha Tau Omega during the fall 
fraternity pledge night. The re
port included recommendations 
of possible social probation for
ATO and the establishment of 
concrete pledge night policies. The 
investigation began as a result of 
a fight that broke out between 
members of ATO and Delta Upsi
lon when the DU brothers walked 
onto ATOs porch in a ritual that 
occurred often on pledge night. 
They felt that ATO as a house 
was responsible for the actions of 
the individuals who instigated 
the squabble.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Novem
ber 2,1992Earlier in the week, 
the owners of the Pittsburgh PostGazette announced their plans to 
purchase the Press Company from 
Scripps. The Press Company 
owned The Pittsburgh Press and 
handled the production and circu
lation of the Post-Gazette under a 
Joint Operating Agreement. The 
agreement was originally made to 
protect the weaker newspaper, the
Post-Gazette, while ensuring that 
competition would survive.
ONE YEAR AGO, November 
4, 1996  A CMU team of four 
students and an advisor faced 
competition from 41 of the best 
collegiate business schools in 
North America, and walked awav 
with second place in the case chal
lenge issued by Electronic Data 
Services (EDS). The challenge 
involved each team of four stu
dents working to consult EDS on 
the feasibility of a business pro
posal. Backed by a total of more 
than $30,000 in scholarships, the 
competition attracted many en
trants from prestigious institu
tions such as Northwestern Uni
versity and University of Wis* 
consin-Madison.

Senate puts Activities Fee increase to vote
FEE, from page 1
Index (CPI)  an index which mea
sures inflation  released by the Fed
eral Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
Another factor was that the 24 stu
dent organizations that were funded in 
1991 and are still funded today now 
have combined budgets of $304,667, 
whereas in 1991 their budgets totaled 
$324,284. By adjusting the 1991 figure 
for inflation, Senators arrived at the 
amount of money the 24 organizations 
should be receiving, $395,56230 per
cent more than they receive currently.
I think [the'proposed increase has] 
definitely been a long time coming, 
said Neil Donnelly, junior material sci
ence and engineering major and gen
eral manager of WRCT, an organiza
tion which depends on Activities Fee 
funds. It will help a lot of the organiza
tions on campus, and doing that, it will 
also help students. ________________
Because organi
zations have be
come more efficient 
in their expendi
tures, 100 percent 
of an Activities Fee 
increase would not 
need to go directly 
to organizations, 
said Bryon Krug, 
student body presi
dent and senior electrical and com
puter engineering major. Some of this 
money could be used to fund special 
projects that benefit the campus like 
the 35 mm projector for McConomy, 
the They Might Be Giants concert, or 
the development ofthe More wood base
ment for student use.
I dont think its fair to raise the 
Activities Fee for all students because 
most of the students dont really partici
pate in school activities anyway, said 
Sang-Hi Suh, a first-year BHA student.
The vote will take place November 
20-21 in Kirr Commons from 10 am 
until 6 pm. Originally, Krug and other 
members of Senate had planned for the 
referendum to be voted on during last 
weeks Student Senate elections. But 
the resolution was delayed by Senates 
debate over the Graduate Student As
sembly (GSA) proposal which Senate 
wanted to iron out first, since the pro
posal restructured the way Activities 
Fees were distributed in Senate and 
effectively reduced the amount of money 
available to student organizatipns once
it was passed, according to Krug.
We wanted to make sure we under
stood what rules wed be playing by 
before we made a decision about rais
ing the Activities Fee, said Krug.
Theres a potential that [holding 
the vote after the elections] will ad
versely affect the turnout, said Krug. 
But we plan to overcome that by pub
licizing the referendum heavily and by 
working through organizations so that 
students are aware ofthe referendum. 
King said Senate is planning a pub
licity blitz to make students aware of 
the upcoming vote and the particulars 
of the referendum.
Meetings of organizational presi
dents and interested students will be

Senators will encourage attendees to 
get the word out about the proposal. 
Signs will be put up all over campus
There's a potential that [hold
ing the vote after elections] will 
adversely affect the turnout.

student body president
and Krug will include an explanation 
ofthe referendum in the Student Sen
ate newsletter. In addition, the Ac
tivities Fee increase will continue to 
be a point of discussion on the Stu
dent Senate radio hour on WRCT.
Amongall those things, students will 
have the opportunity to really under
stand the rationale behind this deci
sion, said Krug. I feel confident that if 
students understand that rationale, they 
will support the Activities Fee increase.
As of now, only the undergraduate 
student Activities Fee is set to be voted 
on. GSA will hold a meeting November
5 to decide whether raising the gradu
ate student Activities Fee is also nec
essary. If GSA passes a resolution call
ing for a referendum, graduates will 
vote separately from undergraduates 
but at the same time and location.
If the referendum passes later this 
November, Senate will make a recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees at 
their February meeting. The Board 
will then have to approve the increase 
for it to take effect next year.
CMU begins evaluation process
REVIEW, from page 1
put a few ideas on the table for consider
ation in the future.
Topics of discussion included the need 
for better communication between stu
dents and administration, interdiscipli
nary studies in education and research, 
and the quality of student life. Students 
also mentioned how recruiters view CMU 
as a purely technical school, despite 
strong programs in humanities and the 
arts, Shankavaram said.
The strategic planning committee will 
be holding a series of town meetings in 
the spring semester to get broader input 
from faculty, students, and staff. The
strategic planning process also gathers 
student input through student surveys 
and questionnaires. I think this input 
has had a significant influence on the 
process and specific actions we will take, 
Bolton said.
Kamlet said that survey work on ev
erything from food to the amount of 
sleep students get is paid attention to 
quite a bit. After receiving complaints 
about the quality of student life in the 
1980s, the University set an agenda to 
enhance the quality of student life. 
Kamlet noted projects such as the Uni
versity Center, improvement in the 
physical appearance ofthe campus, and
the Purnell Center for the Arts. I think 
its a much prettier place, Kamlet said.
The preliminary visit gave Rawlings 
a chance to familiarize himself with 
Carnegie Mellon, to understand how the 
visiting team can best serve the Univer
sity in terms of offering advice and feed
back, said Jeff Bolton.
I dont think were worried about be
ing accredited, Kamlet said. Were in a 
pretty good position to get accreditation. 
What we want to do is to try to get as 
much useful feedback as we can.
The complete accreditation review will 
take place Februaiy 22-25.
Student body elects new Senators
ELECTIONS, from page 1
candidates. We thought it would be a 
more educated vote. Voter turnout has 
been significantly low. A lot of people will 
say I dont know the candidates, said 
Sarah Gross, the public relations chair 
for Senate and a sophomore political sci
ence major.
[The publicity] helped a lot, but we 
still need to do more to create interest so 
people don?t think [the elections] dont 
effect them. If people think it doesnt 
effect them then, of course, they wont 
care, said Krug.
We did a lot of work for the elections. 
There was a lot of publicity. People knew 
what was going on. The problem lies 
generally in the apathy of the students, 
said Gross.
Gross plans to run again for the Public 
Relations chair position. If re-elected, 
she plans to make improvements to the 
WRCT show by interviewing a wide range 
of guests that interests the student body. 
In addition, she would like to set up a 
town meeting forum where people will be 
able to voice their opinions. For the Spring 
Elections, Gross plans to set up a forum 
for debate among the presidential candi
dates or a soapbox on the Cut to answer 
questions from students.
Other newly elected Senators are hop
ing to use their term on Senate to im
prove the quality of student life and to 
make changes in their respective de
partments. I want to make student life 
better on campus. I dont know how to 
accomplish that, but Im sure Ill figure
it out, said Spiros Christoforatos, a po
tential new Senator and first-year busi
ness administration major.
Geoffrey Go, a current Senator that 
was re-elected for the upcoming term 
and a sophomore industrial manage
ment major hopes to unify business stu
dents through social events and increase 
the requirements to transfer into IM 
from 2.0 to 2.5. We want to make the IM 
department more respectable, said Go.
Id like to see Student Senate con
tinue to be more active on the campus 
community. So student needs are being 
represented to administration to seek 
out what their constituents want. We 
have a lot of room for improvements.... 
We need to continue to make positiv 
progress, said Krug.
Crime and Incident Report
10/27 THEFT, over the weekend  
An officer was dispatched to the Resnik 
mail room to speak with an employee 
about a theft which occurred sometime 
over the weekend. He stated that when 
he arrived for work that morning, he 
found the mail window unlocked and 
ajar. After a thorough check of the area, 
he found that there were packages to be 
delivered to eight people missing. There 
were no signs of forced entry in the 
immediate or surrounding areas.
10/28 MEDICAL, 10 pm  An officer 
and a student EMS went to Cathedral 
Mansions in response to a request for 
medical assistance. There they found a 
female with an injured foot. EMS treated 
her upon arrival. About an hour before, 
she had dropped a lava lamp on her right 
foot. There was some swelling but no
discoloration, and the victim said she 
could not move her big toe. She was 
transported to Presbyterian Hospital.
10/29 HARASSMENT BY COMMU
NICATION, 8:17 pmAn officer took 
a harassment report from a CMU fe
male who said she had received a call 
from a male of high school or college 
age. He began with a belch, followed 
by, How do you like that, babe? Last 
week she received a similar call. She 
was told to keep a log of incoming 
prank calls and to report them to Cam
pus Police if they persist.
10/30 CRIMINAL ATTEMPT, 10:30 
pmAn officer, assisted by two others, 
responded to a C-Cons request for po
lice assistance becaust two women and 
one man were attempting to fabricate
IDs, claimed the C-Con. He asked the 
three for some real identification, but 
they presented none. He then told them 
to stay and wait for the police to arrive. 
The male fled, but the females stayed. 
The C-Con aded that he observed them 
scan an ID and change the information 
contained in several different fields. 
The women were verbally identified. 
One said that they were playing around 
in Adobe Photoshop making a Turkish 
ID. The officer informed the women 
that it is a criminal offense in Pennsyl
vania to fabricate IDs. The C-Con said 
that the students did not get the chance 
to print the ID as a result of his calling 
the police as soon as his suspicions were 
aroused. Both women were told that a 
report would be filed and that they 
should always be carrying their CMU 
identification on their persons.

New Business from the Committee:
Presentation by President Krug 
about the Activities Fee increase: 
Organization budgets are becom
ing limited due to the decreased 
amount of money available to them 
because of the new constitution, 
and a lack of increase in the Activi
ties Fee since 1991. There are three 
possible solutions: 1) Raise the 
Activities Fee by $2.50/semester, 
referendum not required; 2) Raise 
the Activities Fee by $15/semester, referendum required; 3) Double
Activities Fee, referendum re
quired. I recommend that we raise 
the Activities Fee by $ 15/semes
ter. This will allow us to increase 
organization budgets, offset cor
rections for money lost due to the 
graduate student situation, and 
have money for special projects. 
To increase the Activities Fee by 
$ 15/semester a referendum is 
required for approval of the stu
dent body (this includes info ses
sions and publicity about the pos
sible increase). F&R and the Trea
surer also support the increase.
Activities Fee increase refer
endum on November 20 and 21: 
Proposed resolution stipulates an 
undergraduate referendum for a 
$ 15/semester Activities Fee in
crease. Approved by hand vote 
(18-0).

FORUM
uJlief-e d sferri on
Carnegie Mellon University3 November 1997
Platforms should be 
better publicized
Student Senate held elections 
last week, and despite improved 
efforts to get out the vote, voter 
turnout remained low, with an 
estimated 8% of the student body 
voting. Though Senates Public 
Relations Committee may have 
increased publicity efforts, the 
political climate remains inad
equate in the context of cam
paigns, elections, and political re
sponsibility.
In actuality, it is laughable to 
call elections at CMU a race, 
and this is the crux of the prob
lem. Students make uninformed 
decisions (when they actually 
do vote), since they generally 
dont know who the candidates 
are, or more importantly, what 
they stand for. Though this year 
Senate published a few candi
date platforms in a short bro
chure, the effort was too little, 
too late. The brochure was made 
available at the election table, 
and was sometimes given to vot
ers after they made their deci
sion. Additionally, no efforts 
were made to put information 
directly into the students hands. 
Instead, a quarter sheet publi
cizing the elections was distrib
uted to students mailboxes. 
While this is also an improve
ment in publicity, it does not 
adequately aid students (espe
cially off-campus students) in 
making informed decisions.
However, it should be up to the 
candidates themselves to market
their views to their constituents. 
Tomorrow, millions of Americans 
will go to the polls to vote for 
public officials who have suc
ceeded in convincing Joe Citizen 
that they are the best people for 
the job. If the electoral process 
does not resemble the national 
system, it is because voters are 
not adequately educated about 
campus politics before they are 
asked to take part in them. Phone 
calls, leaflets, and publicized pub
lic speeches are effective ways to 
spread information on the candi
dates and their platforms.
It is also the responsibility of 
students to try to become informed 
by questioning candidates before 
they sign their petitions. Yet, stu
dents argue that putting time into 
the elections is futile since there 
are so few candidates running in 
the first place and students fail to 
run because there is little avail
able information on how and why 
to became a member of Senate. 
The first step in improving the 
process is by increasing aware
ness of Student Senate itself so 
there is more competition for Sen
ate seats.
The political culture on this cam
pus is flawed and it is up to both 
Senate candidates and students 
to improve it. By making effort to 
inform, to stay informed, and take 
a proactive role in the election 
process, Student Government can 
become a viable voice in the com
munity.
Empty campus spaces 
should be put to use
While space for student activi
ties tends to be limited, two viable 
areas on campus, the Morewood 
basement and WRCTs previous 
location, have been vacant for over 
a year now. Many ideas regard
ing how to put the spaces to use 
have floated around, yet neither 
the administration nor Student 
Senate have taken the first step 
in initiating any plan for action. 
Such locales have the potential to 
provide students with the extra 
space that is sorely needed; stu
dents should start setting plans 
in place before the spaces default 
to uses such as offices for faculty 
or graduate students.
A year ago, Student Senate 
made promises to renovate the 
empty Morewood basement into 
a student facility  a place to 
hang-out or an alternate stu
dent coffeehouseyet they have 
yet to follow through on these 
ideas.
The Morewood Basement Plan
ning Committee has been work
ing in conjunction with Business 
Services with the intentions of 
not only implementing a plan for 
the space, but also following 
through with it by the end of the 
semester. But plans were post
poned, and as it seems, they were 
forgotten altogether. With a 
mechanism already in place to 
implement use for the Morewood 
basement, the only thing prevent
ing the space from becoming a 
campus resource is student ini
tiative.
The same holds true of WRCTs 
previous location; the rooms have

been empty since the fall of 1996 
when the radio station moved into 
the University Center. Because 
of its location on Margaret 
Morrison Street and its dimen
sions, the now-vacant facility has 
many possibilities for student use. 
Options such as an on-campus 
dance club, party area, or even 
just a recreational room could 
improve student interaction by 
providing a convenient place for 
students to relax and meet others 
in a setting other than a class 
room or dormitory. Groups such 
as residence assistants, ASA, 
SALSA, and Spirit are often 
pressed for places to hold floor 
activities or group parties, but 
with the use of a recreational area 
such as WRCTs old space their 
options would increase signifi
cantly.
The space could also provide ex
tra interviewing areas other than 
those found in the Career Center. 
Students and interviewers often 
complain that the current inter
viewing rooms are too cramped and 
therefore make an already stress
ful situation more difficult to deal 
with. But with larger rooms allo
cated from the space in the old 
WRCT facility, this problem can be 
eliminated easily.
The ideas for these empty spaces 
are not hard to come by and, in 
fact, with coordination on the part 
of and administrators, the projects 
can soon be realized. Senate has 
the influence to help implement 
student input into any possible 
plans, but it is important that 
they take the initiative.
Letter to the Editor
While I appreciate the support indicated 
in the article, I would like to clarify some 
misconceptions. I fear that students who 
read the editorial may avoid study 
abroad, believing the process to be too 
cumbersome. In reality, approximately 
120 of our students participate in study 
abroad programs per year, while an
other 300 express interest.
Most who go abroad find the experi
ence extremely rewarding.
At Carnegie Mellon, we have one Study 
Abroad Advisor. The process for arrang
ing study abroad at Carnegie Mellon is 
actually very individualized. The major
ity of students who study abroad begin 
their search through discussion with 
the Study Abroad Advisor.
During this meeting, I spend quite a 
bit of time working with the student to 
identify programs that will best fit their 
major and interests. It is possible that 
the author of the editorial visited the 
Office of International Education (OIE) 
without realizing that it was possible to 
make an appointment.
It is true that all study abroad credits 
must be approved by the students aca
demic department. This is in part due to 
Carnegie Mellons decentralization and 
in part because Study Abroad is not 
within the academic wing of the Univer
sity. The result is that Carnegie Mellon 
students actually have numerous possi
bilities for study abroad, rather than 
only a few select programs where the 
courses have been preapproved. All 
courses are approved in writing before 
students leave for study abroad.
Financial aid is always tricky with 
study abroad; however, there are sev
eral very good options where students 
can take aid with them. In OIE, there 
are some excellent reference guides for 
outside funding.
However, it does take time to search 
through the options, and a student must 
start early to apply. I welcome all to visit 
the office for more information.

Your report on 
Halima Addous -key
note speech at the In
ternational Festival 
[Peace advocate pro
vides insight on Is
lamic issues, 10/27] confuses both the 
events in Algeria and what was said at 
the lecture.
Contrary to what Susan Watson wrote, 
modern Algeria has never had an IsLetter to the Editor
lamie government. Since independence
from European powers, North African 
states have had secular regimes relying 
on nationalism, pan-Arabism, or in the 
case of Libya, a personality cult, but 
never Islam as their guiding ideologies. 
In fact, the only widespread grassroots 
opposition they face is from Islamic par
ties such as the Algerian FIS (French for 
Islamic Salvation Front) and the Tuni
sian Nahda (Arabic for Renaissance).
In 1992, the Algerian army cancelled 
the national elections the FIS was poised 
to sweep in order to save democracy. 
Since then the country has been gripped 
in a civil war between the popular 
FIS and the entrenched militarybacked government.
Police defectors have spoken [AFP, 10/ 
29] of systematic executions, torture, 
and rapes in government prisons and by 
government death squads masquerad
ing as beard[ed]...Islamists.
Neither Addou nor Watson noted that 
several FIS offers of cease-fires have 
been followed by bombings of mosques.
Addous reference to the repression 
under the military government, her fail
ure to differentiate between the FIS and 
GIA (French for Armed Islamic Group) as. 
well as her constant labeling ofthe popu
lar opposition as terrorist Islamists only 
highlights her own partisanship.
It was also ironic to hear Addou de
fend action against -FIS, which Algeri
ans themselves voted for, and then lis
ten to her accuse its supporters of schizo
phrenia over democracy.
She painted the diverse Islamist 
groups as a monolithic fascist... Nazi 
force bent on mind control.
In fact, it is the governments of coun
tries threatened by democratic Islam
ists, such as Algeria and Turkey, which 
strictly control what can be taught at 
schools and announced at mosques.
Instead of providing listeners with a 
broad background to modern Algerian 
history, Addou appeared to be pushing 
her own broadly feminist/Arab-nationalist philosophy.
I found it rather tendentious of her to 
reduce everything in the Algerian tur
moil to cultural patriarchy and a sup
posed religious misogyny.
It is difficult to imagine how a peace 
advocate with such slanted views could 
ever facilitate dialogue.
Given the combination of a partisan 
speaker, an uninformed audience, and 
emotional subjects it was not surprising 
to read in Watsons article and hear 
from the lecture floor that Islam itself is 
against democracy and women.
This is belied by the sources of Islamic 
jurisprudence as well as the experience 
of countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia, 
and even Iran, which have universal 
suffrage and democratic institutions. 
Having encouraged these common 
sterotypes, it seemed disingenous of 
Addou to state that she wasnt speak
ing against Islam but against Is
lamist groups.
No wonder Watson missed this closing 
remark and boldly titled her report as 
an insight on Islamic issues. The only 
insight it offers is how polarized the 
issues have become.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
In response to the 
editorial about study 
abroad [Study 
Abroad Office should 
be expanded, 10/27],
I must honestly say the article was rather 
unjustified, inaccurate, and misin
formed. Im a student who has worked 
for the Study Abroad Advisor for two 
years now, and additionally, I have stud
ied abroad myself. I see many of the 
students who come into our office asking 
about study abroad, and Ive met many 
of those who have returned.
First of all, there is only one Study 
Abroad Advisor, as opposed to one or 
two. In addition, more than 150 stu
dents studied abroad last year, but over 
200 interested students stopped into our 
office to talk to the Study Abroad Advi
sor. The figure of over 120 students 
interested in Study Abroad was mis
quoted. The article suggested more per
sonal attention for individual students 
was needed. However, the Study Abroad 
Advisor achieves this, meeting for at 
least half an hour (usually more) indi
vidually with students.
Many students also stop in freely to 
talk to the advisor. I believe that we do 
not need more advisors, and that plenty 
of personal attention is already given. 
The nice thing about having a non-academically-based Study Abroad Office is 
that non-academic issues are more freely 
discussed. Secondly, the article stated 
that students need an advisory system 
that will help them coordinate course 
credit transfers betweeen universities.5 
This is what the Study Abroad Advisor 
already does!
Ask any student whos studied abroad, 
and he or she will tell you about the 
Study Abroad Transfer Credit form and 
who enters them into the system as 
studying abroad! She also advises stu
dents on financial aid options.
Although it is true that students need 
to seek scheduling help from their aca
demic advisors, this is something which 
cannot be avoided at Carnegie Mellon, 
where students must take responsibil
ity for their own course schedules.
The statement that there is little in
formation available about studying 
abroad at the host schools is rather am
biguous. There are so many different 
study abroad programs that it would be 
impossible to list every single one, yet 
we do already have a lot of information 
from some of the more popular programs.
The Study Abroad Advisor also pro
vides many contacts for interested 
students. Students interested in study
ing abroad should not be afraid to talk to 
the Study Abroad Advisor or visit the 
Office of International Education.
The experience of study abroad, much 
of which is facilitated through the work 
of the Study Abroad Advisor, is highly 
rewarding and valuable, as any returnee 
will tell you.

Belief in constants leads to happiness
eff Thibert
Think about this for a moment: Whats 
really important in your life? Have you 
figured it out? Do you really know whats 
important to you? Probably not entirely 
I dont know if we ever really do, but most 
of us have some idea of what we hold dear. 
These ideas, Im sure, vary wildly  Ive 
certainly seen plenty of different ideas in 
the few months Ive spent at CMU. Ideas 
might not be a good word, though  lets 
go ahead and call these ideas beliefs, so 
that theyll be easier to discuss.
Most of the beliefs that people hold re
garding whats important can be split into 
two major categories: beliefs in variable 
things, and beliefs in constant things.
As I write this, there seems to be quite a 
bit of hubbub in the dorm regarding Hal
loween. What am I going to do Friday 
night? Its Halloween! Ive got to do some
thing exciting! That sort of thing. This 
would be a belief in a variable thing  
people will think Halloweens important 
for a short time, but then, when the day 
has passed, theyll forget about it, at least 
until next Halloween.
On the other hand, I attend Mass, and I 
would think that most of us there believe 
in God  we find Him important. This is 
a belief in a constant thing  God, as we 
envision Him, is not going to change. Other 
sorts of constant things include ideals; 
perhaps I place importance on love or 
beauty. At any rate, youd think that be
liefs in constant things would be stronger 
than the beliefs in variable things, and 
yet, theyre not always.
Although the objects of variable beliefs 
may not be as permanent as the objects of 
constant beliefs, variable beliefs are often 
stronger, because the constant beliefs be
come commonplace, and tend to fade into 
the background. I might think that God is 
important for a much greater time than I 
think Halloween is important, but the 
importance I place on Halloween is much 
stronger than the importance I place in 
God on Halloween night. A lot of people do 
this sort of thing, myself included, and I 
dont think its healthy.Placing variable 
beliefs ahead of constant beliefs is a sure 
way to end up unhappy. I dont deny that 
variable beliefs are important, though.
Thomas Edison probably found his work 
on the light bulb to be incredibly impor
tant, but when it was done, he found other 
things on which to work  other things in 
which to place importance. Your average
CMU student probably finds a final exam 
to be really important that day before he 
or she takes it, so he or she studies a lot to 
do well  but after the exam (perhaps, 
more accurately, after the grade), its not 
so important anymore. Junior year, whos 
going to be worried about their freshman 
fall semester final grade in physics?
So, beliefs in variable things are impor
tant; however, theyre never more impor
tant than the beliefs in constant things. I 
think that we have to remember this if 
were ever really going to be happy with 
our lives. If we spend our lives only placing 
importance in variable things, then were 
setting ourselves up for a dangerous fall.
Have you ever been in a relationship 
that was really important to you that 
suddenly ended, for whatever reason? Its 
not so good. We placed importance in a 
variable thing, and that thing changed 
(for the worse). The only way to remain 
happy on variable beliefs alone is to con
tinually hop from one to another. After 
Halloween ceases to be important, youd 
better find something else, or the happi
ness will go away. After that one relation
ship ends, better find another, or youll get 
so sad! You can see my point, I hope.
Theres a way, though, that I believe we 
can have variable beliefs and still be 
happy. We just have to throw into the
mix a constant belief. If we have this, 
and we always keep it stronger than 
the variable beliefs, then anything can 
happen with our relationships, with 
our grades, with life, and well remain 
happy, because the constant belief will 
carry us through  itll be so impor
tant to us that the variable beliefs will 
fall into perspective.
Whether you believe in God or not, I 
think that the key ideal in which we 
must place importance, above all other 
things, is hope. If we always have hope, 
then we always know that things will 
get better, and end up bestregardless 
of what happens to the variable aspects 
in our lives. A lot of people seem to be on 
the roller coaster ride of happiness, ca
reening between happiness and unhap
piness depending solely on how the vari
ables that are important to them change.
But we can step off the roller coaster 
onto an escalator, always ascending to
wards greater happiness, if we just place 
importance on something constant. Al
though roller coasters are fun for a few 
minutes, I dont think wed want to ride 
one forever.

We live in material world
It starts with the old maternal 
adage, If all your friends jumped 
off a bridge, would you? The au
tomatic, slightly guilty response 
is a resounding No. Who would 
be that stupid?
Yet some niggling part deep 
within everyones conscious 
screams, Yes! Yes, Mother, I 
would! Because theyre my 
friends. Because they want me 
to. Because they think its cool.
Someone thinking something 
is somewhat cool, however vague 
it may be, is a wonderfully pow
erful force.
This force is the basic drive 
behind the huge advertising and 
marketing community. They are 
betting on your instinctual urge 
to be better, to be cooler, to be 
more materialistic.
Materialism reaches into the 
hazy years of our childhood. 
There was always a Lisa who 
had better crayons or a Jimmy 
with better shoes. These two fig
ures represent the instigating 
forces that move the youth of 
America to one-up one another: 
middle- school children violently 
beaten by their peers just for the 
shoes on their feet or the clothes 
on their backs.
The impact of such a conflict 
can be seen in district after 
district: Boards of Education 
across the nation are requiring 
students  in public schools  
to wear uniforms.
One can measure the depth of a 
societal problem by the effect it 
has on the children. This can be 
applied to drug abuse, alcohol
ism, and sex-related issues.
Seen against this harsh back
ground, surely materialism isnt 
all that bad. Yet, in a way, mate
rialism is indeed verybad. It hints 
at a deeper psychological prob
lem for Americans.
Materialism is bred from a mild 
form of mass control or, with a 
flip of the coin, mass hysteria. 
Scary thought. The Big Kids  
the adults  are at play in the 
field of our gullible psyches. BeMark Adato/Tartan Acting Art Co-Editor
hind the unceasing images of 
unattainable beauty and allure 
that flash across the TV screens, 
the movie screens., and the maga
zines are the movers and shakers 
of advertising.
These executives believe in the 
power of the technique known as 
the Testimonial.
Be like me. Be cool. Feel better. 
Buy my Lexus. Look better. Buy 
my Tommy.
Hit with this barrage of cool
ness, Americans willingly and 
fervently spend their dollars 
buying into a cosmopolitan im
age that exists only on paper 
and electrons.
Americans are told by Big 
Brother to look and be a certain 
way. And, by the masses, we 
move to comply.
One of the tragic 
consequences of ma
terialism is that 
Americans are be
coming more desen
sitized about the 
world condition. 
Only a very small mi
nority of the world 
consists of the eco
nomic elitethe de
veloped countries  
whereas the rest are 
developing or under
developed. While we 
worry about facades, 
our Third World 
neighbors worry 
about survival. This 
sharp contrast in 
priorities echoes the 
unofficial American 
policy of apathy to
wards issues that 
threaten the Ameri
can image.
The wealthiest 
nation in the world 
has been hypnotized 
by its own money. 
Everyone wants to
be something else, and no one 
wants to be left out. From our 
children to our bosses, we are in a 
movement to be better and 
spend more.
We all want to be like Mike. 
But should we be?

Crash mimics tulip fad
Last Monday the stock market 
crashed. It dropped 550 points 
in the days trading, which was 
cut short by emergency mecha
nisms due to the drop. The drop amounted to a 7 percent loss of 
total value of stock traded. The news media and government 
described it as anything but a crash, although it was one. 
However, in subsequent days most of the value was regained, so 
the tulips are still in fashion.
No, my choo-choo has not gone around the bend, Im just making 
a historical analogy. In the 17th century a strong lesson in specu
lation was taught to Dutch investors. It has come to be known as the 
Tulip Mania. Tulips were introduced to Europe from Turkey in the 
16th century, and they really began to catch on in the next century. 
Due to their huge popularity, demand outstripped supply and 
prices went crazy. People would mortgage homes to buy a tulip bulb. 
This mania lasted until people decided that maybe the prices 
wouldnt keep rising, then it all collapsed, and a bunch of people lost 
their shirts.
Today, there are a number of measures of the value of a stock. 
There is, of course, the trading value. This is basically a free 
market agreement about what the seller and buyer feel about the 
value. However, there are other measures; that are in some ways 
more meaningful. One of these is a comparison of the total worth 
of the company to the value of the companys shares traded. This 
can often have a huge disparity. Another good measure of the 
value of a stock is the price-to-eamings ratio. This is a comparison 
of the cost of the share of stock to the dividends which the 
company pays annually to the shareholder.
The reason I compare the current stock market to the Tulip 
Mania is that by either of the latter two measures the stock market 
is way overvalued. Of course, price-to-earning ratios have tended to 
be off in the past, but the current stock market has companies way 
overvalued in terms of their assets. Its basically a case of people 
ascribing value to something when it really isnt there. We have the 
emperor wearing no clothes, but everyone likes the cut of his jacket.
Granted this is, in many ways, a gross simplification. The stock 
market does represent more than just the assets of a company. It 
can be seen as a measure of past and future performance. If you 
believe a company will do well, youll expect that shares of that 
company will increase in value. Thus a small, highly profitable 
company can have a huge market value. This is a reasonable 
thing in some ways and is at the core of financial speculation.
I do use the tulip because the overvalue situation makes me 
nervous. Im usually an advocate of the stock market as an 
investment. However, with the number of government regula
tions that make starting new businesses more and more difficult, 
money has to be sunk into old businesses instead of start-ups. 
This is what really causes the price inflation.

primary majors should not have to competc for courscs with students who are choos
ing courses for second majors or minors.

Thanks!
The BOC 97 committee would like to thank all our volunteers for their partici
pation in this year's event.
We are proud that this year's conference was coordinated and run exclusively 
by students, for students and recruiters. Many recruiters could not believe 
that students were running every function of the BOC. Intact, one CMU graduate 
who came as a recruiter, remarked that this year the BOC 97 was the classiest 
event he ever went to on campus.
Without the help of our outstanding volunteers, we would have been just 
another CMU event. Instead, we were the BOC.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  3 November 19979
Boston Bruins brighten season for columnist
(F rom
by Jessica Strelitz
I was lucky to see games in Boston 
Garden, one of the last pocket-sized 
rinks. Your knees touched your neigh
bors and obstructed views were as common-place as cold drafts.
Hockey is the blood that courses
road record than the Bs this year (6-0).
The Bruins have been in a Stanley 
Cup drought since right before I was 
born, having fallen victim to all of those 
line-snakes of pro sports: youth, injury, 
inconsistent coaching, stingy GMs, and 
timing, timing, timing! Boston sports 
teams have always been hard hit; get
ting so close to victory and having one 
thing go the wrong way: the perfect pass 
slipping through the receivers hands, a 
missed three-pointer at the buzzer, the 
ball flyingjust past the shortstops glove. 
We have suffered. We have bitched and 
moaned. We are impatient because we 
see the talent and the teams cant con
trol it. Until now.
For the first time in a while, I hear the
The Bruins have ... fallen victim to all of 
those line-snakes of pro sports: youth, injury, 
... stingy GMs, and timingtiming, timing!
squad? The Habs, sworn mortal enemies 
of every Bruins fan, donated an old, crazy 
coach named Pat Burns. His 
fiery temper, both with his 
own players and with other 
teams, has scared respect 
into the hearts of many in 
hockey. His hair-pulling ti
rades include a tendency to 
be outspoken with the me
dia, including this past 
weeks public shaming of 
leading scorer Jason Allison 
(12 points, five goals) for not 
playing up to snuff in a 5-4 
loss to the Florida Panthers.
Allison, along with recent 
player-of-the-week co
winners and shutout
through the veins of New Englanders. I 
was put on skates before I could walk 
across the living room floor unassisted. 
I was taught to hate the Habs, love the 
yellow and gold spoked wheels, and to 
name my sons Ray, Cam, and Bobby.
So when Boston jumped out ahead 
early this year, posting five straight 
wins on the road with shutouts over 
Anaheim, Vancouver, and Calgary and 
a 8-5-1 record as of Sunday afternoon, 
my heart skipped a few beats each time 
I turned on SportsCenter. Only the reign
ing champion Red Wings have a better
words blooming and positive rebuild
ing. My body quivers when I read about 
Sergei Samsonov, the 8th pick rookie 
who is in the top 10 for rookie scoring 
already, finally getting his first goal 
earlier this week (on a weak rebound, 
but nonetheless). And hes not even the 
million-dollar kid, Joey Thorton, who 
has yet to produce anything but did, 
after all, get injured early on. Maybe it 
made him a bit gun-shy.
But who would have ever thought that 
the Canadians and the Capitals would 
have done so much to form this fresh
kings Byron 
Dafoe and Jim 
Carey, were 
once all Capi
tals. Anson 
Carter, also 
part of that 
huge trade 
that included 
sendingAdam 
Oates and 
Billy Ranford 
down to 
Washington, has also posted 
one goal and eight assists in 12 games.
Success? The Bs needed to get kicked 
in the ass with authority, and that is what
Bums provides. When youre doing badly 
in goal, hell pull ya out. It worked two 
weeks ago when he rotated the goaltenders 
on the road trip. This team went through 
a record five starting goaltenders two sea
sons ago, and now they have 
one of the best tandems 
in the game.
Burns is a not-sofriendly ghost. When he 
came on board, there 
were some definite 
reservations in the 
fans minds. But, in 
time, the trust comes. He 
has shown so much suc
cess with teams in the 
past that the fans have 
no choice.
But ex-coach Steve 
Kasper was too much of a 
pussy for this squad, and 
the players, from both 
sides, skated all over 
him. When he tried 
to show some force 
to get his play
ers motivated 
by benching 
CamNeelyin
1996 for poor 
play, it back
fired. Neely and 
the fans (and my
self) were not 
/ amused; Kasper pretty 
much groveled along for the 
rest of the year, bumbled through the next 
season, and burned out. I am convinced 
that move cursed him for life.
But these Bruins, the team that fin
ished dead last the past season and 
snapped the longest play-off streak of 
any professional sports team in Ameri
can history, are 8-5-1! Im thinking they 
may dominate the division and then 
sneak up on everyone in the conference. 
Ray Bourque (four goals and five assists 
in 14 games) will spawn a third arm tb 
score some more power-play goals  a 
category in which he is now one of th 
leaders (and yes, hes still in Boston, 
home of all of the best non-journeyman 
defensemen). Allison will get about 20 
more game-wining goals (he already has 
three), and I already know that Carey, 
with two shut-outs already, is due for 
many more. He told the Boston Globe 
last week, I havent had a shutout for  
long time. Its like a piece of candyy o 
forget what it tastes like if you havent 
had it for a while. But now that Iv 
tasted it again, I want more.
This all goes to show that The Sport
ing News, Sports Illustrated, ESPN and 
my own personal polls mean nothing. It 
is totally impossible to gauge what will 
and will not click. When pre-season polls 
came out, the Bruins were floating 
around towards the bottom of the pack, 
and now, theyre ripping it up and the 
Beantown clan is happy ... and very 
hungry for some sweet Stanley.
Jessica Strelitz is a senior professional 
writing major who has recently been 
sighted leaving trails of golden sparkles 
all over the fraternity quad and offers 
this advice to her players; Honey Broum 
and defensemen dont mix.

Rugby club battles Pitt
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
On a cold day, when eight men 
from each side of a rugby team get 
together for the scrum, a vapor 
cloud of sweaty mist develops. The 
effect is more dramatic on a rainy, 
muddy field, like the lower field of 
Frick Park this past Saturday.
Thats our kind of game, thats 
our kind of weather, said Josh 
Magnas, a back for the team. We 
really loved it.
The CMU mens rugby team 
fought, pusehd, sweated, but were 
overcome 35-5 by 
Pitt on the lower 
Field of Frick Park.
CMUs scrum 
pushed around Pitt 
all day, but they 
were hurt by the 
opponents stron
ger backs.
The scrum was ___________
winning almost ev- n 
ery scrum-down, said junior Jim 
Pastorius.
The game featured big gains and, 
as a result, little of the contest was 
played in the center of the field. 
Pitt had the first advantage, mov
ing the ball downfield with their 
backs, out-running and out-mus
cling CMU on the outside.
But the game was a referreed 
with a quick-whistle and Pitts 
momentum was stopped with a 
scrum ten yards from the CMU 
goal line. Here, the Tartans dug 
in, pushing the Panthers back
five yards and stealing the ball. 
But Pitt got the ball back in, as a 
bald-headed moose of a back 
plunged into the middle of CMUs 
backs for a score. The straight on 
kick was good.
But CMU came charging back, 
making short passes and gaining 
ground even though they never 
got the ball far outside.
The passings key. You want 
short, nice easy passing, said 
Magnas. You got to get the ball out 
to the wing. Our fly-half would get 
the ball and theyd be right on us. 
The CMU drive was helped out
Were a little shallow with 
players, We need people to 
come out in the spring. 
 Jim Pastorius 
sophomore back-captain
by some Pitt penalties. They were 
eventually able to dive just inside 
the right corner for a try-down. 
But the kick was going to be tough. 
While Pitt had scored in the cen
ter and kicked from a nice, blue 
plastic tee, CMU scored on the 
side. Instead of a tee, they scooped 
up some mud to plant the ball in. 
The result: the kick had the dis
tance, but was wide left.
Pitt mounted a late rush and 
was able to punch in another score 
against the tired Tartans before 
the end of the half.
Pitts a good team, said 
Magnas. Theyve got a lot of guys. 
Theyve got a big school to draw 
from. From what we had, we did 
pretty well.
Pitt would benefit from their 
superior numbers, making three 
substitutions, with plenty of ex
tras, while CMU swapped out their 
only sub. In the second half, the 
players got more exhausted, more 
mistakes were make, and the 
game only got wetter.
It was sloppy, Pastorius said 
of the game. There were mis
takes on both sides.
Although CMU wasnt out of 
the game until late, the well 
rested, experienced Pitt team 
owned the second half. The 
Panthers added two scores late 
on CMU mistakes.
Half the guys on the tea1 
have only played two or three 
games, said Magnas, who 
noted that the new players are 
 improving every game. The 
team stood up strong against their 
Division I opponent, but ran out 
of gas.
We came out stronger this 
game than any other game, 
Pastorius said about the team.
We came out [of the game] 
feeling good, said Magnas. With 
the fall season over, he looks to
wards the spring. Weve got to 
recruit, recruit, recruit.
Were a little shallow with 
players, said Pastorius, the 
backs-captain. We need people 
to come out in the spring.
Team wins UAA crown
By S. VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Editor-in-Chief 
& CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
Sophomore Mike Campie 
rushed for two touchdowns and 
103 yards on 25 attempts as CMU 
won the UAA outright with a 14-
0 win over Rochester Saturday. 
Campie gained 62 of his 
yards on CMUs first 
scoring drive as the Tar
tans recorded their first 
shut-out of the season.
[Coach Bodnar] 
elaborated a great [de
fensive game] plan.
We knew exactly what 
they were going to do, 
said starting safety,  
junior Jason Funke.
We took it upon ourselves to 
make a statement, said junior 
Chris Schmitt.
CMU outgained Rochester 194 
yards to 189 and held a sixminute edge in time of posses
sion. Quarterback Russ Clay was 
sacked four times for a com
bined loss of 38 yards, but was 
effective when the team needed 
the pass. Clay was 4-8 passing 
for 62 yards. Three of his passes 
went for first downs, including 
a 28-yarder to senior Ricco 
Parrish on the Tartans second 
scoring drive.
We have a lot of potential and 
were starting to live up to that 
potential, said Funke.
CMUs defense shut down 
Rochester, with Schmitt recov
ering two turnovers towards the 
end of the first half, as the oppo
nents were never able to get 
untracked. Schmitt, a line
backer, led the team with 14 
tackles; while senior linebacker 
Trent Morrow had 12, includ
ing two for losses. After a short
We got a lot of breaks. 
We played hard. We made 
big plays this time. 
was a lot of pride on the parf of 
the defense.
The Tartan defense contin
ued to force turnovers late in 
the game. After the second CMU 
touchdown, a 1-yard push 
through the middle by Campie, 
cornerback Jody Rogish recov
ered a fumble after Rochester 
had picked up a first down. With 
under five minutes left, 
backup defensive back 
Matt Morris picked of a 
pass deep in Rochesters 
own territory. Sopho

CMU was unable to score on 
the resulting drive as Clay

The Tartans have two games 
remaing to try and make the 
playoffs. Funke described the 
teams chances of making the 
NCAA Division III tournament 
as slim to none. Only 16 
teams across the country make 
the playoffs.
If we win our next two games 
we have a good chance of mak

The intensity is about the same [as 
in high school], said Tseng. It is harder 
to do a lot of schoolwork with it, but it 
makes you manage yourself better.
The teams look forward to slicing 
seconds off their times and setting 
more records. Last year, many of the 
swimmers swam to personal best times
in their first year under coach 
Belowich.
We just need to get faster, Wheeler 
said. We need to put in more yardage.
I think we just have to work on 
shorter swims and on the small tech
nical details. The big picture is there, 
said McGuire. The smaller details 
have to be filled in.

Mens soccer awaits playoffs
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Staffwriter
The mens soccer team won one and lost 
one of their two final games of the season. 
The loss came on Sunday, October 26, and 
the win this Saturday. The team finishes 
the regular season with a 11-6 record over
all, and a 3-4 record in their conference. In 
the coming week the team will find out if 
their record is good enough to give them a 
spot in the ECAC soccer tournament, which 
they were ranked number one in last year.
The first half of the Brandeis game started 
well for the Tartans. The defense was able to 
prevent any real scoring opportunities for 
Brandeis and CMU forwards senior Jason 
Buelow and junior Harry Ulrich came close 
to scoring, but came up short. At the end of 
the half the score stood at 0-0 .
The second half started with a flurry of 
offense for the Tartans, as they scored in 
the first three miniutes. Buelow sent a 
cross to Uhrich, who headed the ball into 
the net past a Brandeis defender and the 
goalie. Unfortunatly Brandeis hadnt given 
up yet and, five miniutes later, they scored 
on a breakaway in which goalie Ben 
Kartzman had little chance to stop the ball.
CMU had a chance to take the lead back, 
but narrowly missed, banging the ball against 
the crossbar. Finally with 11 miniutes left in 
the game Brandeis broke the tie when they 
were awarded an indirect penalty kick six 
yards in front of the goal for a passback.
The pass back rule is one that was only 
adopted a few years ago in soccer to force 
defenders to clear the ball on their own by 
not allowing the goalie to use his hands
when the ball is kicked back to him by 
one of his own players. The controver
sial part of the rule is that the ball 
must be intentionally kicked towards 
the goalie.
During a Brandeis fast break, the ball 
crossed in front of the goal and hit a CMU 
defenders leg while he was in stride. 
Kartzman dove to catch the ball as it 
redirested towards the goal. The referee
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
CMU took to the air against Chicago.
awarded Brandeis a shot, and in effect the 
game, when he called a passback violation.
The final nail in the coffin came with 
about four miniutes left when a long 
shot went into the goal past Kartzman 
who was 30 yards out from the goal to
help push the ball up to the offense. 
There were no more goals in the game 
but Kartzman recived a yellow card for 
punching a Brandies player when he 
took a shot at him with the ball after the 
referee had blown a play dead.
Disapointed by their loss but still hop
ing for playoff spot, the team went into 
their last game needing a win. It was 
also the last game for Buelow. He has 
been one of the teams most productive 
players this year in scoring, playmaking, 
and creating offensive opportunities.
Once again the weather for the game 
was less then perfect, with cold tem
peratures and a moderate, steady rain. 
Neither team created many 
opportunites for themselves, but Buelow 
nearly scored on a break up the right 
wing where he beat the defender, but 
missed wide right with a low shot from 
a tough angle.
Neither team managed more than 
that for most of the game, and although 
the CMU defense played well in limit
ing Chicagos chances, the offense had 
difficulty. Chicagos main defensive tac
tic was to put eight of their players 
within the penalty box to prevent clear 
shots on net or passing into the area for 
a close range shot.
Finally, in the last miniute of play, 
when it looked like the game was going to 
overtime, Beulow scored the winning goal.
He received a long pass from the de
fense, and followed the ball to within 15 
yards of the Chicago goal when he shot 
the ball between the legs of the Chicago 
goalie for the win.

the team that finds itself down to 
an inferior team. The Tartans 
were not backchecking at all and
 with the exceptions of junior 
Steve Leonhardt and grad-student Jon Berkowitz  were lazy 
and late to the puck.
Finally, after struggling with a 
heavy screen the whole game, 
the first line penetrated the of
fensive zone with 20 second left 
in the period and, on the power 
Play, Fitzgerald found the back 
of the net on a rebound from 
Duncan and Dave Mitzel, senior 
defenseman. CMU went into the 
locker room for the break with a 
3-3 tie.
Nobody wanted to do any
thing and everybody looked like 
they forgot how to play hockey, 
said assistant coach Matt 
Wiliams about the dead play of 
first two periods. Every line 
was afraid to play. Nobody 
wanted to win.
But Duncan wanted the win, 
and his line was hungry for some 
toore points. Right off Fitzgerald
winning the first face-off of the 
third, Duncan controlled the puck 
and soared down the ice all alone, 
smacking the puck in and giving 
CMU a permanent lead.
I wasnt producing all night, I 
had to do something, said 
Duncan who scored again five 
minutes later assisted by 
Berkowitz and Fitzgerald. Scott 
had good draws all night and I 
wanted to capitalize on those. The 
puck was laying there and I just 
took it and went in.
Down 5-3, where they would 
stay for the remained of the game, 
Cal got chippy and started mak
ing runs at CMU players. Half
way through the final period, 
Duncan got railed by one of Cals 
monster defensmen, Zack 
Zadroga. Duncan retaliated with 
an uppercut, Zadroga skated back 
towards him and a short tussle 
ensued. Both were quickly ejected 
for fighting.
At the break between periods, 
I asked the team to do two things, 
said Coach Fred Maddalena. I 
asked Jon to shut them out, which
he did. And I told the rest of them 
to force the play harder. They did 
and we got the win.
CMU managed to avoid any 
more confrontations, keeping cool 
heads and making simple plays 
to avoid any scuffles with the 
angry Cal squad, which ended up 
tallying almost 30 minutes in 
penalties on the game.
Its nice to get back into the 
play. Its tough to watch a game 
from the bench, said Kliegman, 
who ended the night with 26 
saves. Hopefully, we wont have 
to pull it.out the third again, but 
its nice to know that we can.
Im really disappointed and 
afraid of whats going to hap
pen when we start playing bet
ter teams. I hope we rebound 
from this and play hard all three 
periods against Allegheny, 
said Williams.
The team faces rivals Allegh
eny College on Saturday at 8 pm 
in the South Side. A free bus will 
leave the UC turnaround at 7:30 
that night for any interested fans.

Women end growth year
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
Its really hard, especially on a 
loss, said senior Mary Wall of 
the CMU womens soccer teams 
season finale Saturday afternoon. 
It wont be like this again.
Wall, senior Lauren de Rosset, 
and junior Julie Spinnato, who 
plans to study abroad in Austra
lia, have played their last game 
for the Tartans. In their last game, 
the team showed a gritty deter
mination that was characteristic 
of the entire season.
With just under 12 minutes left, 
things got heated. Chicagos for
wards had been obstructing the 
Tartans all game, throwing their 
weight around. De Rossetbecame 
fed up and tackled Chicagos big
gest forward. She received a yel
low card for her effort.
I thought the game was kind 
of ugly, but we fought really hard, 
said coach Ann Haggerty.
If her brother Will had given 
her more training, the other girl 
would have landed on the ground 
first, said Dr. Robert Schinazi, 
who was visiting to watch the 
seniors last game.
I was very impressed with 
Laurens wrestling, said sopho
more Courtney Marrett.
They were very physical and 
very skilled, de Rosset said after 
the game. They played a great 
game.
They may have won, but 
theyre still ugly and were still 
better looking than them, said 
sophomore Jocelyn Pollack of the 
rough-playing Chicago team.
Junior Lindsay Smith and the 
rest of the Tartan defense kept 
Chicago scoreless in the first half, 
and with CMUs offense unable
to register a shot, it looked like the 
game might be another 0-0 tie.
But five minutes into the sec
ond half, the defense couldnt get 
the ball out from in front of goal. 
In a crowd, a Chicago player 
banged the ball past a blinded 
Smith, into the bottom left corner 
of the net.
Halfway into the second half, a 
similar situation arose. Chicago

Freshman Kari Pylphyshyn clears 
the ball out of the defensive end.
had managed to bring the ball 
close and to the front again. Smith 
stood in the center of the net, 
prepared to cover the entire goal. 
The shot went to the right, and 
the Chicago bench started cheer
ing prematurely as Smith flailed 
her left arm out to barely deflect 
the ball the the right.
I have never seen anyone more 
amazing than Lindsay in goal, 
de Rosset said, including CMUs 
past goalie, All-American Jill 
Weber. Shes really grown.
Her last remarkable save came
with just over six minutes left. 
For the third time in the game, 
Chicago moved the ball deep into 
CMU territory. A pass to the left 
side set up a perfect shot oppor
tunity. But Smith dove and 
punched the ball out preventing 
the goal and assist.
Im just very sad its over. Ive 
had a wonderful time and the 
girls have been the best friends, 
said de Rosset. I want to thank 
Ann and John for a great season. 
I think that even though our 
record is below .500, we did a 
great job this year, said Haggerty. 
To get some of the wins we got 
was great. In some of the losses 
we played really well too.
I was really proud ... we had 
the toughest schedule in the re
gion, said Wall. Theyre going 
to be amazing.
I think everyone will be stron
ger and more unified, said 
Marrett, noting that the fresh
men will benefit from Haggertys 
offseason workout schedule and 
more work in the weightroom. 
Marrett also mentioned that 
Haggerty did a great job on re
cruiting this years freshman 
class and has put a lot of time and 
effort into the incoming class.
Were going to work on our 
shooting, said Pollack.
Even though a lot of times we 
were short on numbers, a lot of 
people stepped up, said sopho
more Romy Fischer on the com
pleted season.
This was a building year and 
were really looking forward to 
next season, said freshman 
Cindy Echevarria. But the un
derclassmen havent seen the last 
of the seniors. 
I will be back for the alumni 
game, de Rosset promised.
Hockey ices Cai teamTartans score final three goals to win
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon hockey 
team got a third period boost 
from the feisty play of Adam 
Duncan to beat California Uni
versity of Pennsylvania on Sat
urday, 5-3, remaining unde
feated in their division of the 
Western Pennsylvanian Col
lege Hockey Association.
For first two periods, play was 
even. Cal scored early on their 
first shot against starting 
goaltender Jon Kliegman. 
Kliegman shrugged off the 
bobble and went on to have 11 
saves in the period.
The team looked shaky com
ing out, surprised by the strong, 
young Cal team. The Tartans, 
frustrated by some missed edges 
and sloppy passing, continued 
to change shifts shaking their 
heads in frustration.
Then senior Scott Fitzgerald, 
alternate captain and first line 
center, grabbed the reins of the 
scrambling crew. The usually 
quiet forward checked his way 
cleanly up the ice, opening lanes 
for his linemates to crash the 
net. Captain Paul Voulgaris, con
trolling the puck from the point, 
took a long shot towards goal 
and Fitzgerald rammed in the 
rebound to tie the game halfway 
through the first period, 1-1.
The score stood until the sec
ond when the second line sprang 
into action on CMUs many 
power plays. Sophomore P.J. 
Grzy wacz skated hard down the 
left side, stopped in front, and
slipped the puck to an incoming 
Derek Jander, senior alternate 
captain. Jander chipped the puck 
over the tenders head to give 
CMU a 2-1 lead.
 But the lead was short lived. 
Cal hit right back, beating the 
CMU defense down the ice arid
lift the team to a higher level, 
and his efforts were matched by 
the play of the first two lines of 
defense, including the freshmen 
tandem Doug Faust and Aaron 
Hula. Faust maneuvered his 
body well to keep the puck in 
play off of his skates and

Swim teams break 
records, win meet
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor 
& CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
CMUs swim teams started their sea
sons on the right foot Saturday at an 
all-relay meet in Rochester, New York. 
The women placed fifth last year and 
were looking to improve. The men won 
the event last year and were trying to 
defend their title.
The men were equal to the task, 
said head coach David Belowich.
Sophomore Mike Robinson made a 
more emphatic statement. CMU 
swimming kicks ass, the swimmer 
said. Out of 11 schools, CMU was 
first with 185 points; followed by

Even the third stringers are 
extremely good. 
 senior Jake McGuire
SUNY-Geneso (172) and SUNYCourtland (154).
But it was the women who started 
the season off right. On the first event 
of the day, the womens, team of Junior 
Jen Skuly, sophomore Erin Rockwell, 
freshman Melissa Schmelzer, and 
sophomore Kara Cook set a school 
record in 400-medley relay (4:14.04). 
The same team, with the addition of 
Schmelzer for sophomore Melissa 
Sloan (whos currently running cross
country), set the previous record at 
UAAs last season.
Out of 12 schools, the women were 
second with 155 points. The meet was 
won by Ithaca (194). SUNY-Geneso 
was third (151).
You train and train and train and 
you need a meet to see where you are, 
said Belowich. It seems the swim teams 
are on top of their game. Everybody 
swam very, very well, said Belowich.
Pretty much everybody swam bet
ter than they thought they would be
cause its so early in the season, said 
senior captain Chandra Wheeler.
The womens 400-freestyle team of 
freshman Jullie Tseng, Cook, Skuly, 
and Smelzer also set a school record 
(3:45.38). Senior Jake McGuire and 
freshmen George Heidinger and Tim 
Kendig set a meet record in the 300- 
butterfly at 2:42:28. McGuire, senior 
captain Mike Foster, freshman Jon 
Alpert, and sophomore Mike Robinson 
made up another record-setting Tar
tan relay team in the mens 400- 
freestyle (3:14.78).
We all went pretty fast. For the 
first meet of the season, it was pretty 
fast, said Tseng. [We have] a lot of 
team unity.
With the amount of time the team puts 
into practice, its easy to see where the 
team unity is built. They practice every
________________ weekday afternoon
as well as Monday, 
Wednesday, Fri
day, and Saturday 
mornings.
Its real com
petitive, nicely 
competitive, said 
Belowich. He de
scribed the prac
tice as a good situation.
Everyone on our team is good, said 
McGuire. Even the third stringers 
are extremely good compared to some 
of the other teams we swam.
W e have a lot of depth, said Wheeler. 
We have a realitively young team, 
said Belowich. According to the coach, 
the seniors have been doing doing a 
good job helping out the 20 freshmen 
on the team. Belowich set up mentors 
for each of the freshmen on the team.
We all have mentors that are in 
our departments, Tseng said. The 
mentors are handy just in case we 
need somebody.
I think it helps a good deal because 
as a freshman its a strange environ
ment, said McGuire. Its a big differ
ence between your RA who has to help 
30,000 people on the floor and your 
mentor who spends a couple of hours 
helping you out.
According to Tseng, the level of 
swimming competition is about the 
same, but CMU takes its toll.

Tennis pair takes second place
By RYAN KELLOGG
Tartan Staffwriter
For CMU womens tennis team mem
bers Elisabeth Brown and Keri Mills, 
the weekend of October 23-25 was one 
not of rest and recovery from a tough 
week of classes, but one of physical exer
tion and raw emotion  the kind rarely 
seen outside of athletics. The team com
pleted a successful fall season by send
ing Mills and Brown to the National 
Small College Rolex Championships in 
Memphis, Tennessee. Mills, as a result 
of placing first in the regional tourna
ment five weeks ago, competed in the 
singles bracket and placed seventh in 
the nation. She then joined with Brown 
to form a potent doubles team that went 
looking for a national title.
While Mills, a junior, had competed in 
this same tournament for the past two 
years, her partner Brown is one of the 
newest members of the team  a fresh
man who despite her lack of experience
at the college level has risen to the 
number two seed on the team. Compet
ing in a major national tournament 
posed its challenges.
I was really nervous; I wasnt sure 
how well wed do, said Brown. Coach 
told us the level of competition would be 
similar to a tournament earlier this year. 
It was a high level of competition.
The duo got off to a somewhat rocky 
start that Brown describes as a little 
bit tight but pulled out a victory. 
After shaking off some of the firstround nerves, the pair began to roll. 
We got better and better as the tour
nament went on, said Brown. The 
ball was definitely bouncing their way 
as they defeated a team from Luther 
University and reached the finals 
against St. Norbert.
Going into the final match, We were 
really psyched, said Brown. Everything 
went our way in the first set. Mills and 
Brown won that set 6-3 and needed to 
take one of the next two. But after going
up 4-3 in the second set and needing 
only two games to close out the match, 
things took a turn for the worse.
We got over-anxious and tentative, 
said Brown. The team from St. Norbert 
was able to come back and win the 
second set 64 and then win the title 
with a third-set victory, as the CMU 
pair finished second in the nation in 
Division III.
Despite a somewhat disappointing fin
ish to an otherwise superb tournament, 
the team remains upbeat, while the loss 
has only hardened their resolve.
Overall we played well. It was a good 
tournament, said Brown. Both Mills 
and Brown were named All-Americans, 
and second in the nation is not too shabby 
for a team that will be back next semes
ter, when tennis starts again in Febru
ary, and next year will have a shot at the 
same title.
Once youve been that close, you dont 
want to settle for anything else, said 
Brown. Well win it next year.
Crew wins medals at Occoquan
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
There was a lot more enthusiasm, se
nior Oliver Sung said of CMUs Crew club 
this season. People really came to prac
tices and put a lot 
more into practice.
The enthusiasm 
paid off, as the club 
wrapped up its fall 
season at the Head 
of the Occoquan Sat
urday, in the sub
urbs of Washington 
D.C. Approximately 
40 club members 
made the trip to 
compete. The Tar
tans were led 
through the 26 team 
event by the 
womens Novice-4 
boat and the mens 
Varsity-4. Both 
teams placed fourth, 
which earned two 
medals for the club.

of sophomore Beth Litzinger and fresh
men Amy Fluharty, Meredith Powers, 
and Keri Pearson finished the 5K course
in 22:26, just 0.4 seconds behind 
Duquesne. The womens Varsity-A-4 fin
ished in a time of 21:16.
The first race I hugged the course 
really well, said freshman Chris 
Raubacher, the coxswain for the novice
turny course according to club presi
dent Klaus Moser. Sophomore Ryuji 
Kusumoto indicated that the course is 
scenic, with a lot of trees and has chal

Kusumoto.
It was a really,

Between the live performances, 
fans could enjoy the DJ, view a 
video installation by senior art 
major Rich Pell, visit the Am

table, play Pong on an Atari, bob 
for apples, play ring toss with 
records, or refuel at a refresh
ment table.
One performance that I found 
particularly interesting was Op
eration: Re-information. Display
ing a unique brand of geek-chic, 
the trio used computer keyboards 
connected to Macintosh 
Powerbooks to play their music, 
instead of guitars or drums. The 
band members were very person
able with the audience, and I
thought their songs were really 
quirky and fresh.
Although many attended 
Tainted Candy to see Hurl and 
Don Caballero, other bands fared 
very well. Doug Mosurak, senior 
english major and jazz director of 
WRCT, especially enjoyed Four 
Hundred Years. They are tight 
and direct and have amazing dy
namics as a band. They executed 
tempo shifts that froze my brain, 
he said. Randerson said that their 
performance was great, listing it 
as his favorite, along with Rye 
Coalition. A lot of bands have 
this large energy and style that 
doesnt come across on a record, 
but really came through at the 
show, he said.
Hurl didnt disappoint 
Mosurak; they are extremely 
loud and have a full, reaching 
rock sound that spreads through
out the audience, he said. The 
long awaited performance of the

For most people, whether or 
not to join a club or some sort of 
student activity is something 
they decide after they choose a 
collegeits something they con
sider after orientation, after they 
move into their dorm room and 
after they timidly try out the 
cafeteria food. But for Neil 
Donnelly, he knew he wanted to 
join the campus radio station 
before he even got to CMU. In 
fact, its a big part of why he 
came here in the first place.
I used to listen to WRCT in 
high school, said Donnelly, a 
junior material science and en
gineering major and general
manager of WRCT. I was in
trigued by much of what I heard 
and it was fascinating to me 
that I was hearing sounds so 
diverse on the radio. When it 
came time for me to choose a 
college, WRCT was a big factor 
in my deciding to attend CMU.
The Pittsburgh native had been 
following local artists for quite 
some time, but it wasnt until he 
became involved with WRCT that 
he began to gain exposure to 
music that generally is not sup
ported by other local media.
WRCT is the only station in 
Pittsburgh that has the power 
to promote the local scene in 
Pittsburgh, its surrounding 
communities and the world, he 
said. Many of these band such 
as Jumbo, The 1985, and Op
eration: Re-information receive 
little or no attention from other 
radio stations.
It is this kind of influence 
that has lead WRCT to be a 
leading figure in the local in
dependent rock scene for the 
last two decades since the sta
tion became -freeform in the 
70s. The shift in programming 
at that point changed the 
stations identity. [Thats 
when] we started playing mu
sic that is a bit more arcane 
and hard to find elsewhere, 
said Donnelly. Since then ... 
we began to receive support 
from those who were a part of 
Pittsburghs underground 
scene. Its a very symbiotic re
lationship, really. We play a

Inside look at radio station reveals production process
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
For most people, WRCT is j ust the sounds 
and music that flow from your speakers 
when you decide to swing the radio dial 
towards the bottom end of the airwaves. 
But in reality, the student-run station is 
an intricate, pulsing hub of activity.
For those who may not know, WRCT is 
an independent, non-commercial radio 
station, playing music and talk shows 
on a freeform setup. Freeform means, as 
Junior biology major Elad Kaufman, 
WRCTs very own Fighter Hayabusa, 
said, We just play whatever.
DJs are given total control over the 
content of their shows, provided that 
they play at least three songs off one ofthemost recent albums. The bin cuts,
as they are called, are a way for 
the station to give a nod to the 
record companies that gener
ously provide them 
with new CDs.
The station, lo
cated in the basement 
of the University Cen
ter, is a bizarre compilation 
of CDs and vinyl, photos and 
promo stickers related to bands, 
and more new-fangled gizmos than 
you can shake a stick at. People can 
be found on the lobby couches at any 
time of day or night. This is where the 
radio people review new albums, wait 
for their show to begin, or just take a 
break from their hectic schedules.
Immediately to the left is the ex
ecutive office, home of the seven
members of the 
executive 
board. These 
folks are what 
hold the 
whole show 
together, 
managing 
over
&
140 people who are involved in the sta
tion. The General Manager, Program Di
rector, Chief Engineer, Business Man
ager, Staff Representative, Public Affairs 
Director, and Public Relations Director 
make up the executive board. They deal 
with any issues related to their particu
lar area of expertise, as well as being 
contacts to the outside world.
On the opposite side of the lobby is the 
door to the music library. WRCT has the 
largest record library in Pittsburgh, with 
between 50,000 and 75,000 albums. The 
room is about 30 feet long by 15 feet 
wide, and the shelves are about eight 
feet high, completely filled with music. 
The albums range from classical to rap 
to the all inclusive rock category, more 
commonly known as black because of 
its color coding.
A short walk away lies the DJ booth. 
This is where most people joining WRCT 
want to end up. Because of the great 
interest in the position (and rightly so) it 
comes with enormous responsibilities. 
Besides the bin cuts, DJs must read 
public service announcements, promos 
for WRCT happenings, and the concert 
calendar on the air, as well as keep logs 
of their show and give radio IDs hourly.
Separated by only a plate of glass is 
the Master Control Room, where talk 
shows are held, and where the bulk of 
the fancy doohickeys and 
whatchamadozits are kept. Talk shows 
require much more preparation, and as 
such, are assigned a producer. They 
keep the equipment and the speakers 
running smoothly. For presentation to

I think the purpose [of the Last Lec
ture series is] to get some faculty who 
have taught here for some time to get 
their thoughts down for some consider
ation. The purpose is to get some thought 
and reflection on the part of the student 
audience, said Peter Steams, dean of 
the School of Humanities and Social 
Sciences and previous lecturer in the 
series. It was a lot of fun to do, but the 
title is a little daunting when you are an 
aging faculty member.
The Last Lecture series is organized 
by the Office of Student Affairs and was 
started six years ago. It gives the CMU 
community an opportunity to hear 
prominent speakers present the lecture 
they would give if it were their last.
This is not an idea unique to this 
campus. The usual premise is that a 
senior professor answers the question, If 
this were really your very last lecture,
what would you say to your students?  
said Hugh Young, professor of physics 
and lecturer in the spring of 1992. I 
would hope that if I were [to give] a talk 
like this, that my life and what Ive done 
with it will give students something to 
think about in setting goals for their own
Some of [the students] have worked 
with these faculty; it is hopefully fun for 
them to see faculty speak about areas 
outside of their specialty. The lectures 
are well attended, said Stearns.

a short throwback to an older concept of

education where the faculty are able to show 
their wisdom outside their specialties. Fac
ulty can have a broader conversation and a 
wider purpose with their teaching. Thus, 
the wisdom can be transferred from one 
generation to the next. This kind of teaching 
is not accepted by todays standards.
Young said that the lecture was not 
meant to be on his own subject, but more 
on the philosophy of life. His lecture was 
entitled How to Write a Good Obitu
ary, because he wanted to cover how a 
student could make a difference.
I think we can all learn from the 
examples of those who have gone before 
us, so that we can be more successful in 
whatever it is were trying to do and 
perhaps even arrive at better defini
tions of success, said Young.
The next lecture in the Last Lecture 
series will be given by Dr. John Hart, 
professor of English. It will be held this 
Monday at 5 pm in the Adamson Wing in 
Baker Hall.
Hart has been a faculty member at 
CMU since 1946, teaching literature 
and focusing on Shakespearean works. 
He has written two books on

Conference tackles Pittsburgh social issues
By DANIELLE PIERATTI
Tartan Staffwriter
The great equalizer is education, said 
Pittsburgh Superintendent of Public 
Schools Dale E. Frederick, PhD, at the 
annual meeting and conference of the 
Urban League of Pittsburgh Inc., which 
took place last Saturday in McConomy 
Auditorium. His speech emphasized the 
value of young people to bring about 
change in the future, something which 
the League takes very seriously.
The Urban League ... is particularly 
interested in making sure our children 
are okay across the board, said Esther 
L. Bush, president and chief executive 
officer of the League, in her annual re
port, Quality of Life: The Mission and 
the Means.
The city of Pittsburgh, as well as the 
rest of America, needs to address the 
issues that are encompassed in our mis
sion statement, she said.
Weve got to deal with the issues, not 
push them aside, said Frederick. What 
weve got to work on as a school district 
in this community are the issues of edu
cation, access, and achievement for all.... 
Our children are our most precious com
modity.... We are educating our children 
for our future.
Fredericks speech, however, high
lighted only a small portion of the 
issues that the Urban League of Pitts
burgh addresses in attempting to ful
fill its mission, which is to provide 
social service programs for the pur
pose of improving the quality of life 
of African Americans. In addition to 
education programs, the League or
ganizes employment and housing pro
grams, many of which were referred 
to on Saturday not only during the
conferences general session, but also 
during the three workshops that fol
lowed. These workshops were en
titled: Charter Schools: From Con
cept to Reality, Knockout Job 
Search Techniques, and Yes, You 
Can Own a Home.
What we are finding is people dont
which, if passed this Tuesday, will raise 
millions for economic development

also mentioned, further emphasizing 
the importance of the young populacnua idiiidud/ idiidii udimuum oidii

understand that they can own a 
home, said Bush. She pointed out 
how the League has worked hard to 
increase peoples awareness.
Theyre realizing that they can 
have a slice of the American Dream, 
which is home ownership, she said.
She also mentioned other efforts, such 
as improving race relations, forming 
family support centers, hosting regis
tration for voters, and collaboration on 
the Regional Renaissance Initiative
tion. In addition, people attending the 
conference were given an educational 
packet which contained information on 
the Urban League, as well as some of 
the programs which it sponsors.
The speakers stressed the impor
tance of community involvement to 
make these programs successful and 
to instigate change.
Schools are and become no more 
effective than their communitys ex
pectations, said Frederick.
Bush also asked for community help 
in instituting the Regional Renaissance 
Initiative. The Urban League is always 
involved in advocacy, she said. The 
effort is  vote yes to the initiative.
The Urban League of Pittsburgh was 
established in 1918 in an attempt to 
better the lives of southern African 
Americans who migrated to Pitts
burgh. Since then it has been impact
ing the lives of thousands of families 
within the Pittsburgh area through 
its social services.
I think [the League] is all part of the 
positive aspects of living in this region, 
said Chairman of the Board George L. 
Miles Jr.
Next year the League will celebrate 
its 80th anniversary, a date that, as 
was indicated in the meeting, is sched
uled to be commemorated with events 
throughout the year.
What we want to accomplish is to 
have higher visibility for the Urban 
League ... so that we can assure our
selves that the Urban League will be 
here another 80 years, said Miles. Its 
going to be an exciting year for the Ur
ban League.
We are openly recruiting young people 
on our board. I want to make sure we 
have a balance between the young and 
the older, said Miles.
Dr. Cohon is a new member of our 
board, so we would hope that the part
nership between the League and 
Carnegie Mellon makes a connection. 
Having key educators on our board  
theres the connection, he added.
The yearly conference was concluded 
with a closing reception in the Schatz 
dining room. For more information on

Columnists crush 
results in revelation
Bordering Normalcy
by Carrie Jones-McGuire
So theres this guy.... I know, I 
know. Too many stories begin this 
way. Yes, Ive taken a writing class. 
Yes, I know Im not supposed to begin 
with clichs, I have to grab the 
readers attention and all that. My 
story begins with that immortal 
phrase this week because I am a 
clich right now.
I have a crush.  big one. So what, 
you say. Welcome to college, Carrie. 
You live, eat, and work with all kinds 
of smart folks who share similar in
terests. Of course youre going to get 
crushes on people.
Theres this guy in one of my 
discussion classes who makes me 
sigh in that appallingly eighthdeal. But sometimes I think, 
dammit, Im an undergraduate. Im 
supposed to be getting stupid 
crushes and having self-destructive 
affairs with distant boys and tragic 
girls. Im supposed to be going put 
drinking nights before I have tests. 
Im supposed to be free-wheeling, 
fun-loving, and having a good time.
Think about it. At what other point 
in your life are you going to have this 
good an excuse to be a complete and 
total moron, combined with enough 
freedom to really do a good job at 
screwing up your life and enough of a 
safety net to catch you? College is all 
about being on your own in the world 
for the first time, figuring out how to 
be a grown-up, and pinning down 
what you mean by grown-up, any
way. What do you want? What do you 
need? What work can you do that you 
find compelling? What drives you 
crazy in relationships? And what do 
you like?
Im already signed up for the long 
haul, and it is in some ways more 
difficult to find these things out when 
one is already very much attached. I

grade way. Hes very cute, terri
bly, terribly clever, and just a little 
bit distant. Ah, my favorite. He 
also shares a name with, like, three 
of my ex-boyfriends. Ive no idea 
why this happens. But its not just 
me. My sister tends to end up with 
guys named Chris. Its not my 
fault. I just have a thing for ... 
(you didnt really think I was go
ing to announce it in the paper, 
did you?).
Excuse me. Im rambling. Can you 
tell I feel a little weird about this? 
The thing is, see, I got a crush on 
this guy and started doing that day
dreaming thing, wondering how he 
takes his coffee and what book is 
beside his bed. You know the drill.
The day I had an actual conversa
tion with him* I came home, ran to 
find my sister, and breathlessly con
fided every word. Heaven help me, 
I think I actually squealed. But then 
I had this startling revelation: I 
cant possibly do anything about 
this. Im married. Lots. And I was 
really, really irritated by this. This 
is not to say that I dont want to be 
married. I love where I am in my 
life. Im well-loved, well-supported, 
and I laugh a whole lot. All things 
considered, Ive got a pretty sweet
person. I have to call home and ex
plain and tell them not to hold din
ner. When I figure out something I 
need that Im not getting, I have to 
ask for it in the context of the rela
tionships I already have, rather than 
just ditching this life and finding 
another one.
This week, with this shiny, new 
person, I really wanted to test-drive a 
new thing instead of already having 
bought the car, you know? But Ive 
made my choices in these matters, 
and they are good choices.
So Im contenting myself with 
fantastical musings about spend
ing the night with somebody in a 
dorm room or a funky little apart
ment, listening to music by a band 
Ive never heard before. Im dream
ing, just a little, about checking 
out the bookshelves to see what 
matters to this new somebody, what 
passions are there, what pictures 
are on the walls, what cartoons are 
taped up by the computer.
And the window Im looking out 
is in the home I share with the 
ones I know, the ones I love, the 
ones I chose.

Activist calls for people of faith
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Features Editor
Last Sunday morning, a rain
bow flag was pitched outside of 
the First Unitarian Church of 
Pittsburgh on the corner of 
Morewood and Ellsworth Av
enues. That flag was a testa
ment and a welcome sign for 
Candace Gingrich, a gay rights 
activist who has become just 
as famous for her outspoken 
support of gay issues as she 
has for being the lesbian sister 
of Newt Gingrich, the wellknown conservative Speaker 
of the House.
Gingrich came to the Uni
tarian church to explain how 
people of faith can be active 
in creating equality for gays 
and lesbians and why it is 
important that they take on 
such a cause.
I know that some of you 
have been activists long be
fore I knew I was a lesbian 
and long before I was born, I 
would venture to say, so this 
may be old news to you, said 
Gingrich. I acknowledge and 
appreciate that by being here youve 
shown me that this is something you 
care about.
Gingrich found the First Unitarian 
Church of Pittsburgh via their Web 
site and approached them a month 
ago about participating in their Sun
day Morning Forum series. According 
to Ruth Mouly, organizer of the forum 
series, Gingrich is not the first to 
speak about gay rights, but she did 
draw one of the largest crowds the 
church has ever had for a Sunday 
Forum session.
Reclaiming Our Lives From the Re
ligious Right was Gingrichs topic for 
the session. She explained that there 
is a need for people of religious faith to 
support the gay rights movement. With 
members of the religious right and 
Christian Coalition as major oppo
nents, she stressed the involvement of 
people of faith as a way to prove that 
those with religious beliefs assert that 
gay people deserve the same human 
rights as anyone else.
One of the best ways to take back the 
dialogue [of the religious right] is to 
challenge the absolutes. For instance, if 
youre a Christian, you must be anti
gay. Weve seen that thats hot true, 
said Gingrich. No matter what the 
church is saying about homosexuality, 
its wrong to deny a gay person basic civil 
rights. Thats what were talking about.
Gingrich offered suggestions about 
how people of faith can support the 
struggle for gay civil rights and passed 
out packets from the Human Rights 
Campaign (HRC) to those present at 
the forum. The packets included ac
tion tools to help those interested in 
supporting the cause get a better un
derstanding of the steps they can take. 
Some of these steps include sending 
hand-written letters to Congress, call
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor
Gingrich spoke about gay civil rights to a crowd at the First Unitarian Church of Pittsburgh.
ing Congressional representatives and 
finding out where they stand on legis
lation, and getting involved in local 
school districts.
An issue that Gingrich was adamant 
about was the current legislation for 
the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act (ENDA). While the Civil Rights Act 
of1964 ensures legal protection against 
employment discrimination on the ba
sis of race, gender, religion, national 
origin, or disability, it does not include 
sexual orientation. The ENDA has been 
proposed to provide this protection.
In a 1996 exit poll, 85 percent of 
people thought it was already illegal to 
fire someone for being gay, said 
Gingrich. Before we can get support, 
we need to educate.... One of the most 
difficult things is knowing there are 
moderate and fair-minded people in 
Congress Who just dont have the guts 
to stand up.
According to Gingrich, Arlen Specter 
(R-Penn) was one of the few Republican 
legislators who voted for the ENDA. She 
said that there were only eight Republi
cans who voted for the bill, and of those 
eight, four were about to retire. Gingrich 
hopes that Specter might be willing to 
co-sponsor the bill.
Whether [being gay] is a choice or 
not, one should not deny a person 
their humanhood, or a human their 
personhood. Every person ... should 
at least have the right to a job, the 
right to suppport themselves  
particuarly if they are trying to sup
port a family, said Gingrich.
When a member of the audience asked 
Gingrich if she had any luck in the 
recent years in educating her brother, 
Gingrich replied that she thought she 
was more successful talking to the people 
in his district than talking to him. She 
said that since she has become active
and outspoken, they havent had a chance 
to sit down and discuss the issues shes 
been fighting for.
I thought that [Gingrich] was good 
because she had humor, practical ideas 
for what to do, and she was very 
earthy, said Mouly. I think people 
were surprised to see her because you 
have an idea of what someone looks 
like in your head and then its not 
always what you thought.
Some audience members had diffi
culty with Gingrich referring to them 
as people of faith. One said that as 
Unitarians, their religion is based 
more on a set of principles about the 
fairness and dignity with which 
people should treat each other and 
that the word faith almost implies 
a kind of Biblical dogma which is not 
a part of Unitarianism. While 
Gingrich replied that she wants to 
get that kind of fairness in action, 
another member of the audience said 
it would be beneficial for people to 
start re-examining strong words such 
as faith and see how they can be 
used out of their Biblical context to 
enhance their Unitarian beliefs.
In this way, the forum became an 
examination not only of gay rights but 
of the implications of religion and the 
role that religion plays in fighting for 
civil rights.
The support and the endorsement of 
the voices we dont usually hear from are 
going to make the difference, said 
Gingrich. [Politicians] hear from us all 
the time. In fact, theyd say theyre sick 
of us, the same way were sick of hearing 
from Pat Robertson or Jerry Fallwell.... 
Just remember that your voice is very

By NEEMA AVASHIA
Tartan Staffwriter
Calling all CMU students: Put 
on your dancing shoes and get 
ready to dance the night away! 
On Saturday, November 15, from 
noon to midnight, the first an
nual Dance Marathon, hosted by 
the Greek Community, will be 
happening in Wiegand Gym at 
the University Center, and ev
eryone is welcome.
Participants can enter the 
marathon individually for $5 or 
as part of a five-person team and 
split the $20 team entry fee. Stu
dents taking part in the Dance 
Marathon are then asked to get 
sponsors to give flat donations 
for the number of hours they are 
willing to dance. Money raised 
at the Dance Marathon will be 
donated to the Childrens Miracle 
Network (CMN).
The Dance Marathon first 
came up last semester, when 
CMN approached Denise Mo
rales, Panhellenic Council phi
lanthropy chair and sophomore 
biology major. Morales heads the 
committee for the Dance Mara
thon, along with Chris Barnicle, 
IFC social chair, and senior phi
losophy major, and Jason 
Katcoff, Greek Council social/ 
philanthropy chair and sopho
more chemical engineering ma
jor. Were [the Greek commu
nity] pioneers for this at CMU, 
said Morales.
Ever since the Greek com
munity first decided to sponsor 
the Dance Marathon, its mem
bers have been working to make 
this event happen. Along with 
the three committee chairs 
listed above, there are also five 
Dance Marathon committee 
heads who worked on specific 
areas of the Dance Marathon. 
These areas include morale, 
public relations, marketing, en
tertainment, family relations, 
and internal plant.
Emily Zajano, head of the 
public relations committee and 
sophomore biology major, de
scribed the various tasks that 
the PR committee has been per
forming. Along with the mar
keting committee, headed by 
Elise Selinger, a sophomore 
materials science and engineer
ing major, the PR committee 
asked for donations from com
panies and local sources, and 
received donations from 
sources including the Princeton 
Review, Society of Women En
gineers, IFC, Alpha Epsilon Pi, 
Student Life, Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy, and 
President Cohon.
The important thing to re
member is that this isnt just a 
Greek thing. Its a campus-wide 
philanthropy, said Zajano. She 
said that prizes will be given to 
winners of contests at the Dance 
Marathon and encouraged every
one to attend.
Eric Silverman, head of the in
ternal plant committee and 
sophomore chemistry major, 
worked with site-specific details 
for the Dance Marathon. The in
ternal plant committee was in 
charge of obtaining a site, sound 
system, and workers.
Silverman said that the Dance 
Marathon will be emceed and
deejayed by some strong person
alities from all around campus. 
Anyone who comes will certainly 
enjoy themselves and not be dis
appointed, Silverman said.
The Greek community at CMU 
is involved with several philan
thropic projects each year, in
cluding the Great Greek Food
Run, the Wing-A-Thon, Cansome 
Ransom, Rent-A-Delt, Greek 
Sing, and Mr. Fraternity.
The Greek Community here 
is trying to have fun and raise 
money at the same time, said 
Katcoff. This is a way to get 
involved in philanthropy and 
have a good time, he said.

Quirky lyrics define new CD
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
First, I must admit that Im a bit 
biased in writing this review, since I am 
going to marry G. Love. Of course, he 
doesnt know this yet, but its bound to 
happen  written in the stars, as they 
saywe even share the same birthday. 
Daydreams and love stories aside, G. 
Loves latest release, Yeah, Its That 
Easy, is an eclectic album displaying the 
diversity of the artists musical styles.
I Who: G.Love & Special Sauce 
\ What: Yeah, It's That Easy 
j Company: Okeh Records
G. Love plays with all four of the bands 
he has toured with through the years on 
this album, but Special Sauce, consist
ing of Jeff Clemens on drums and vocals 
and Jimmy Jazz Prescott on bass, ac
companies the artist on most of the songs. 
G. Love continues to take center stage 
with his guitar, harmonica, and smooth 
lyrics. His music is a combination of 
blues, hip-hop, and rock n roll, which 
the artist refers to as ragmop.
Garrett Dutton, known to fans as G. 
Love, began playing guitar when he was 
eight years old. The Philadelphia native 
cites John Lee Hooker, Bob Dylan, and
Bob Marley as his early influences. In 
1992, G. Love moved to Boston where he 
met Special Sauce while doing club gigs. 
G. Love writes most of the music for the 
band. The lyrics are usually deeply per
sonal, as is the tradition in blues music.
1-76 is the catchiest tune on the al
bum, with its Philly travelogue explain
ing which roads to take when someone is 
trying to get around the city.
A G. Love album wouldnt be complete 
without at least some reference to bas
ketball, and Love manages to pump up 
the 76ers with little quips like Charles 
Barkley dissed Larry Bird. He is joined 
on lead vocals for the song by Katman 
and Smiles, who complement Loves glib 
style of speaking.
The fast-flowing lyrics continue on 
Recipe. The opening lyrics, Suck it 
through a straw, set the tone for the 
rest of the song, in which the artist 
explains his style of rhyming in quirky, 
even silly, lyrics that demonstrate the 
musicians charm. I got olive oil and I 
got spinach, I toot pipe like Popeye, 
smile like Grimace, flip like the 
Hamburgler.... Its easy to pick out the 
few songs on the album that were writ
ten by other members of the band be
cause they lack the spunky originality of 
G. Loves rhymes. Stepping Stones, 
the first radio track, is one of the many
jilted-love songs on the album. The first 
question that comes to mind is, who is 
mistreating my Love? Once past that 
pressing question, its entertaining to 
see how the story translates into lyrics 
for the musician. First, hes a stepping 
stone, then he warns that you will find 
out that should have left never left my 
side in You Shall See, and finally he 
spends over nine minutes warning dont 
you pull the wool over my eyes in Pull 
The Wool.
The album takes a very mellow wan
dering for several songs, the most strik
ing of which is Willow Tree. When the 
artist sings Let me be your weeping 
willow tree, surround you with my long 
limbs, in his sexy, goofball style, I cant 
help but lapse into my daydream of 
spending my days and nights with the 
Love. The lazy, melodic beats just seem 
to flow naturally for the band to create 
an intoxicating sound that is both easy 
to listen to and sing along with.
If the music is not enough to convince 
you to buy the album, the CD actually 
doubles as a CD-ROM called Cooking 
with G, which shows G. Love preparing 
one of his favorite gourmet meals. If 
youre looking for fresh, funky music 
then Yeah, Its That Easy will hit the 
spot. Just remember, G. Love is taken  
so listen but dont touch.
Singer keeps club audience rapt in stellar performance
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Acting Diversions Editor 
& RYAN SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
She walked onto the tiny 
stage at Rosebud wearing an 
orange-sequined dress. Her 
thin, blond hair dangled 
demurely in her face, and with 
a frail hand she brushed it 
back, then produced a rubber 
mouse and squeaked it into 
the microphone. In a thick Brit
ish accent, she said, Happy 
Halloween, and the show be
gan. Although she seemed ner
vous, her six-foot frame had a 
presence on stage that in
stantly engaged me.
Her name is Beth Orton, and 
on Friday night she wooed an 
entire audience at Rosebud, a 
club in the Strip District, most 
of whom had never heard her 
name, much less her music.
Ortons music has a style that 
is difficult to pinpoint. Admit
tedly, her roots begin in dance, 
but she blends elements of blues 
and pop.
Her live show was a depar
ture from her work on her al
bum. On Trailer Park, she of
ten used electronic elements to 
create 90s folk. But on stage, 
she was all soul, with bluesy 
lines hinted at by her vocals 
and the keyboards, and still 
haunted by intensity. Her 
seven-member band, which 
consisted of the standard gui
tar, bass, and drums, and also 
included a keyboardist, a cel
list, and a violinist, combined 
to create a lush and natural 
sound that, for an hour and a 
half, drew the audience into 
her music.
Oftentimes the balance be
tween a vocalist and the back
ing band is skewed in favor of 
one or the other. In Ortons 
case, though she has a power
ful voice, its breathy quality 
allowed it to mix perfectly with 
the backing band.
Rosebuds slick setup proved 
an interesting contrast for 
Ortons show. Ahigh-ceilinged 
space, coupled with industrialinfluenced decor and a dance 
floor, made an intimate atmo
sphere. Such closeness also 
caused some distractions, with 
waitresses clinking glasses 
and people eating.
But as the show progressed, 
the distractions faded away; 
Ortons show was too enchant
ing. Besides her own expres
siveness, Ortons musicians, es
pecially the string players, 
seemed to fall in and out of 
trances at each of their en
trances.
Before Ortons set, a Califor
nia-based band called Grandaddy 
opened, and the intimacy that 
helped Ortons music hindered 
Grandadd/s. They are a fivepiece guitar-based group that 
utilizes both heavy guitar and 
sampling, a combination which 
struck me as odd.
During their set, they ran the 
gamut from slow and plodding to 
fast and distorted. They used re
corded sounds, and although most 
of the chords were unimagina
tive, there was an element of in
tricacy.
Their songs seemed wellthought-out and complex, but be
came bogged down by repetition. 
In one song, the lead singer, who 
seemed fairly skilled in his gui
tar playing, switched to the keyis partially understandable af
ter speaking to the band mem
bers. Apparently, they showed 
up to Rosebud after a night of 
sleeping in their van amongst 
their equipment.

the more endearing.
During her 12-song set, Orton 
also played four non-album

Band makes noise beautiful
By CHARLES FRYMAN
Tartan Staff writer
Theyve been compared to the 
Pixies, Pavement, Pink Floyd, 
and Hank Williams. I like to think 
of them as a cross between Guided 
by Voices and the Mummyheads. 
But on their latest release, Un
der the Western Freeway, 
Grandaddy has a style thats won
derfully unique.
I Who: Grandaddy 
I What: Under the West ern Freeway 
(Company: Will Records
Grandaddy is an indie rock 
band that came onto the scene 
last year with their debut release, 
A Pretty Mess by This One Band. 
While the first album impressed 
me, Under the Western Freeway 
managed to make me even more 
pro-Grandaddy. The band con
sists of five guys with beards and
flannels who look like they should 
be at home working on their 
Monte Carlos instead of making 
stellar music. Yet Grandaddy 
produces great tunes on this re
lease from start to finish.
The second song on Under the 
Western Freeway, A.M. 180, is 
my current favorite. Like most of 
the tracks on the disc, A.M. 180 
uses non-traditional synth noises, 
giving the song a Nintendo-esque 
feel. To top it off, there are bril
liant lyrics set to this spacey 
music. True love is reflected in 
the words Well defuse bombs, 
walk marathons, and take on 
whatever together.
The rest of Under the Western 
Freeway is just as pleasing as 
A.M. 180, moving from slow bal
lads, like Collective Dreamwish 
of Upper Class Elegance, to the 
angry Summer Here Kids in 
which Grandaddy states, Im a 
picture of Imdumbivity. The al
bum then winds down with the
tragic observations of Everything 
Beautiful is Far Away. The final 
song is a hidden track consisting 
of about four minutes of chirping 
crickets with an occasional fly 
buzzing.
What really sets Under the 
Western Freeway apart from other 
indie rock releases that Ive lis
tened to is its use of wild key
board sounds instead of the aver
age noises you would expect in a 
rock song. Not only does 
Grandaddy insert these sounds 
into their songs, they make beau
tiful music with them. The way 
that Grandaddy breaks the rules 
of rock music makes me love them 
even more.
I wouldnt change a thing about 
this album. Grandaddy has put 
together a collection of songs that 
leaves you thirsting for more. Un
der the Western Freeway makes 
me want to sit down with 
Grandaddy, have a cigar, and lis
ten for hours.
Artist displays vocal prowess

Saturday, November 1st, 8:30 
pm. Downtown Pittsburgh in the 
A.J. Palumbo theater, a boy fell 
in love with a woman. Dressed in 
a long black shirt and platform 
shoes she sang for an audience of 
all ages, for over two hours. Her 
name: Sarah McLachlan. The boy 
who fell in love was me.
The night started out with folk 
singer Dar Williams who, by the 
way, is from my hometown of 
Chappaqua, NY. Williams re
mained on stage for half an hour, 
singing mostly from her newest 
album, End of The Summer, in
cluding When I Was A Boy, Any
one Out There? and If I Wrote 
You. She started As Cool As I 
Am from her second album, Mor
tal City, with a drawn out, funky 
little drum beat that threw the 
audience off until she started 
singing. A perfect appetizer to 
McLachlan, Williams ended af
ter six songs, all performed won
derfully.
As McLachlan prepares to 
make her entrance, small twinkly 
lights slowly fell from above cen
ter stage, and all of a sudden she 
came on with her band, crashing 
into Building a Mystery. At this 
point I was a little wary of how 
the show would go, with her start
ing with a song that is all over 
MTV and the radio. I wondered if 
I would be sitting through Sarahs 
exact CD versions, or if she would 
change them around a bit. Sarah 
kept me involved with unbeliev
able versions of Mary, I Will 
Remember You, Into the Fire, 
and Fear. She covered songs 
from her latest album as well as 
old songs from Touch. Many of 
her songs are depressing and sad, 
but she explains that ... in sad
ness comes truth.
McLachlan at first appeared to 
end her set with an up-tempo 
version of her most successful 
single, Possession.
After a few minutes of cheering 
and lighters waving in the air, 
she returned with Ice Cream, 
off of Fumbling Toward Ecstasy. 
McLachlan encouraged everyone 
to help her out and sing along. 
For one verse she remained quiet 
as the crowd sang. She proceeded 
with versions of Sweet Surren
der, and an absolutely amazing 
version of Fear, 
at the end of 
which she walked 
off stage, waving 
to the crowd. Un
believable was 
the only thing 
running through 
my head. Before I 
could let my 
imagination run 
wild, she re
turned to the 
stage, yet again.
This time alone 
on stage, she sat 
at her grand pi
ano, beautifully 
foregrounded in a 
semicircle of 
candles. This is 
kind of like a
prayer or a lullaby, she said as 
she started her solo with a beau
tiful piano intro to Angel, from 
her latest album, Surfacing. It 
was a sad but incredibly moving 
piece. Soon she finished and un
fortunately this time she ended 
for real.
McLachlans vocal range is 
something she has learned to 
control with precision and is sim
ply a treat to listen to. I found 
myself entranced with her tal
ent, her elegant demeanor and 
ability to connect with the audi
ence, and that cute little dance 
with her hands. Not to mention 
that shes beautiful herself. She 
broke my heart when she mar
ried her drummer, and she broke 
my heart again last night with 
her voice.

Indie film fest comes to burgh
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
In todays state of things, many of the 
most interesting and important movies 
rarely get seen. Distributors wont buy 
them, theaters wont take them, but in 
many cases people would see them. Film 
festivals are the only way for some of 
these movies to be shown. And major 
film festivals (in Seattle, New York, 
and Venice) are the places to be to get a 
look at some of the best films out there. 
Pittsburgh, being an aspiring metropoThe festival... brings a remark

unknown filmmakers. 
lis, it has come up with its own film 
festival, and its a good one, too. For the 
past 15 years, locals have been able to 
see those elusive great movies, includ
ing, in years past, Through the Olive 
Trees, Mamma Roma, and I Cant Sleep, 
not to mention Switchblade Sisters and 
Orutsukidoji. This year is no exception, 
and for the next two weeks and 50 films 
(not counting short films), therell be a 
little piece of movie heaven right here 
in Pittsburgh.
As usual, the films will be spread out 
between theaters, namely The Beehive, 
The Rex, Regent Square, and of course, 
The Harris and The Melwood. Also, as 
usual, films will be divided into catego
ries including world cinema, U.S. inde
pendents and the ever-popular Midnight 
Madness at the Beehive.
Around the world in 21 films.
Jean-Luc Goddard continues to be as
prolific as any filmmaker, cranking out 
at least one movie every year. It has 
become a bit of a tradition for the Three 
Rivers Festival to bring his latest movie. 
This year it is Forever Mozart, the 
masters latest meditation concerning 
the casting of a movie about the Bosnian 
conflict and in turn the relationship 
between art and politics.

era. The guys behind the camera include 
David Lynch, Peter Greenaway, Wim 
Wenders, and Spike Lee, plus some 30- 
odd more of the most prominent film
makers in the world. That list would 
probably include Emir Kusturica, whose 
prize-winning Underground is showing 
this year. This bit of whimsy is about a 
community that hides underground for 
some 50 years under the pretense that 
WWII is not over.
Im willing to bet that Czech Jan

His previous work includes the night

real-life people thrown in to portray a 
gang of kooky fetishists. Take the kids

Other movies in this category include 
Billie Augusts latest landscape epic 
Jerusalem, Bertrand Taverniers war

action film, Zero Kelvin, and Volker

claims that it is child pornography. Be

The festival also brings a remarkable 
group of films by virtually unknown film
makers. All of these have in common the 
exploration of the U.S., particularly the 
people-endearing, vile {Dear Jesse) and 
confused all at once. Some of them are 
portrayals in a large scale (Anthem, Dear 
Jesse), others from a more intimate point 
of view (Hustler White, Pariah, The 
Headhunters Sister.), Nowadays, films 
of this kind are largely ignored unless 
they become the trendy thing to watch 
{Crumb, Jupiters Wife). Nevertheless, 
many are well worth a sitting. This year 
also includes the special presentation of

it will be playing one night only at the

In the 100 years since its publi

seminal novel in the canon of 
horror literature. Its story has 
been told and retold on stage and

actors and the drama.
To be Stoker-ish about it, the 
play is ultimately punished for 
that bias  the show is ruined 
by its own ending, a painful 
anti-climax. The slaying of 
Dracula is not suspenseful, and 
certainly not magical, and by 
the time it comes, you can see 
that playwright Dietz is in a 
rush, working to finish the script 
before it exceeds the two-and-ahalf hour mark. After all the 
technical wizardry, the end de
serves something really fantas
tic, some final piece of stage 
trickery which would surpass 
everything weve seen.
Instead they just stab Dracula 
in the heart, mime his decapi
tation and go home. It just goes 
to show, the desire for blood 
(and gore) will lead to demise.

an enormous bank of electronic

Film porn stars suffer through change
By ROB PUNKUNUS
Tartan Staffwriter
Boogie Nights is a look at the 
sex and drugs that filled the 
porn industry in the late 70s. It 
is loosely based on the life of the 
70s porno star John Holmes. 
Boogie Nights shows the con
flicts that the characters go 
through as they have to make 
the transition from the 70s to 
the 80s.
What: Boogie Nights Director: Paul Thomas AndersonCompany: New Line Cinema
At the start of Boogie Nights, 
when the main character Dirk 
Diggler, played by Mark 
Wahlberg, is discovered by porn 
director Jack Horner (Burt 
Reynolds), he is reluctant to be
come involved in the porn indus
try. In these scenes, the director, 
Paul Thomas Anderson, makes it 
seem as if Homer is the devil 
trying to seduce innocence. 
Diggler ends up joining Homer 
after he mns away from home, 
and his abusive mother berates 
him, saying that he does not have 
any talent.
After Dirk joins Horner and 
they begin to make films, every
thing is great. They live exces
sive lives where the parties only 
stop long enough to make films. 
Even someone overdosing on co
caine cannot stop the partying. 
Then the 80s hap
pen, and the wild 
lives the characters 
have been leading 
catch up with them.
At this point, Boogie 
Nights is reminis
cent of.Pulp Fiction 
as it jumps to dif
ferent characters 
every scene and 
shows how their 
lifestyles have 
caught up with 
them. In the end, 
the movie finishes 
with an almost un
realistic happy end
ing for the charac
ters who amazingly 
managed to survive the change.
All the characters in this movie, 
while well played, suffer from a 
script that does not deal with 
them in a realistic manner. They 
go from being on top of the world 
in the 70s to the bottom of the 
world at the start of the 80s to 
being on top of the world again as
if everything that happened be
tween the two points of happi
ness is forgotten. The characters 
seem to forget about things like 
losing custody of children and 
being shot at and friends dying. 
In this way, Boogie Nights does
1997 New Line Cinema 
Mark Wahlberg stars as Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights.
not turn out to be the tragedy you 
would expect it to be after an 
hour and a half.
 There are several notable per
formances in Boogie Nights. Burt 
Reynolds successfully plays Jack 
Horner as the character who al
ternates between being a seducer 
of innocence, a tragic figure, and
a father figure at different points 
in the film. Similarly, Mark 
Wahlberg captures the different 
states of Dirk Diggler, from inno
cent youth to fallen star to prodi
gal son. Julianne Moore plays 
Amber Waves, a caring motherly 
figure to all the charac
ters in the film.
Ultimately, Boogie 
Nights tries to be too 
many films at once. 
Anderson, who in addi
tion to directing, wrote 
and produced the 
movie, tries to make it 
a drama, a documen
tary, a tragedy, and an 
action movie at differ
ent points in the film.
In the end, it just be
comes too much to enjoy. 
The movie should not be 
realistic and yet have so 
many unrealistic twists 
in it. Furthermore, at 
around two and a half 
hours, this film becomes a little 
bit monotonous. Anderson could 
have ended the movie earlier, and 
it would have been more realis
tic. All in all, if you want to spend 
two and a half hours in a movie 
theater seeing a movie that should 
be under two hours, this is the 
film for you.

music which seems to do nothing for my ear
drums, enters a group which seems a bit out 
of its era. The group Novocaine seems to have 
missed the peak of heavy metal in the 80s 
and is now attempting to make a name for 
itself in the 90s with the album NP9. Not 
only does it lack the somewhat great string 
work that can be found in the 80s heavy 
metal era, but those damn repetitive lyrics 
that also gave me a headache.
j Who: Novocaine What: NP9Company: Velvel Records
Initially, I felt as though I were giving the 
album an unfair chance by reviewing some
thing I would never listen to, so with the 
advice of a floormate who would know some
thing about old metal, I came to the conclu
sion that the album was crap.
In a meager attempt to sound like Iron 
Maiden, Novocaine fails to accomplish any 
of the classic metal songs which brought 
Iron Maiden their fans. Not to say, though, 
that the album does not contain a few good 
parts, the only problem is that when things 
start to sound good, on comes the lead singer
to ruin the entire song. It has this level of 
awfulness to the extent where I would only 
listen to the album if I were under the 
influence of novocaine.
Now for the ethics behind the album: 
With titles like Daddys Money and 
Modern Man, youre 
only left to wonder 
what the albums 
theme is, if there is 
actually one present.
With only 24 minutes 
of music on the EP, I 
was crying in relief 
when it was all over. I 
found myself willing to 
listen to anything else 
on the radio, even some 
of that strange tribalsounding music you get 
on WRCT.
Okay, it seems that I 
might have become too 
skeptical with this al
bum, so I will choose 
what seems to be the 
best song on this album
 and I use the term 
loosely. The fourth song, Culture Me, defi
nitely requires some metal culturing. I actu
ally think the song is fairly good because the 
beats are somewhat convincing and pleas
ant. The guitarwork in the beginning is excel
lent, but such quality can be found in almost 
all of the alternative groups that reap over 
the pop charts currently, so its nothing to 
rave about.
No more bashing from me: The album is

fan, check them out  you might find some
thing you enjoy, although why you would is 
beyond me.

lot of local artists, which helps 
these artists to make more mu
sic than we can play.
WRCT, which started as an en
gineering class project in 1947, 
began operating with a carrier 
current, broadcasting to dorm 
rooms and academic buildings. 
According to general manager in 
54 Tom Agnew, WRCT was lo
cated in the cellar of an old man
sion on the north side of Forbes, 
which has since been tom down.
From that time up until the 
mid-70s WRCTs main musical 
thrust varied from year to year, 
but it wasnt until the station
became a small 10-watt broad
caster that it moved away from 
mainstream tastes. By the 1980s, 
WRCT increased its power to 100 
watts, its staff to over 100 people, 
and moved its facility into Skibo
ff r
(what used to be CMUs student 
center), where they resided be
fore the move toMargaret 
Morrison Plaza. And in this time,
WRCT experienced its biggest 
change  an increase in power to 
1750 watts.
WRCT lived next to the 
laundromat and below the soror
ity houses until the erection of the 
University Center, which is where 
the station currently broad
casts from.

tention until the early 90s, said 
Donnelly. Bands like Don Cabal
lero, the Karl Hendricks Trio, and 
Hurl  who have put out records 
on Pittsburghs Peas Kor records 
and New Jerseys My Pal God 
among others) are probably known 
better in other areas of the coun
try than they are in Pittsburgh. 
Donnelly expects both the in
dependent rock scene as well as 
WRCT to see much growth in the 
next few years. I think [the un
derground scene] is in a period of 
transition, said Donnelly. Many 
bands that have been quite promi
nent ... have recently disbanded, 
but as many newer acts like Hu
man Investment and Meisha are 
emerging as well. The scene is in 
constant flux, which is exactly 
what keeps it alive.
WRCTs impact extended to 
more than just the independent 
rock scene, says Donnelly. WRCT 
alums are involved in free-jazz 
and avant garde acts such as the 
Watershed quintet and Ensemble 
Duchamp, he said. We also have 
more electronic and hip-hop DJs 
than weve ever had.... Goth bands 
like the now-defunct 
Underflowers and Low Sunday 
Ghost Machine have received 
plenty of support from us as well. 
WRCT is going to continue to 
support music that has no other 
outlet. Weve found our niche and 
theres no reason to try to move 
out of it.
