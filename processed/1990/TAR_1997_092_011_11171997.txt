CMU inaugurates 
President Cohon
By GIL ALTEROVITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
In a ceremony featuring the mayor of 
Pittsburgh, a Nobel Prize winner, and 
bagpipers in traditional Scottish cos
tumes, Dr. Jared Cohon formally took 
the helm as CMUs eighth president last 
Monday. The event took place in Rangos 
Hall, but was also telecast simulta
neously in McConomy Auditorium due 
to seating restrictions.
Speakers included Herbert Simon, 
Nobel laureate and University professorof psychology; president of MIT 
Charles Vest, and Pittsburgh Mayor 
Tom Murphy. Also present were two 
of Carnegie Mellons former presi
dents, Robert Mehrabian and H. 
Guyford Stever.
In his inauguration speech, Presi
dent Cohon developed three key 
themes. The first of these involved the 
desire to complement CMUs distinc
tively practical character with addi
tional-intellectual exploration. Cohon
emphasized this point especially with 
regard to faculty, students, and staff.
As we continue to mature, Carnegie 
Mellon should become a place of indi
vidual discovery and development, he 
said. We should become a university 
that students are sad to leave.
Lets take advantage Of [our] youth 
and shape a research university for the 
21st century... even if it doesnt make a 
buck, he said.
The second theme involved continued 
emphasis on interdisciplinary research 
and joint effort. As I look forward, I see 
interdisciplinary cooperation and collabo
ration as the keys to sustainable aca
demic success, said Cohon. We are jus
tifiably proud* of our record in this regard, 
but I think we have to recommit our
selves as an institution to interdiscipli
nary research and education.... We want 
to have more intellectual brawls like 
those that characterized our earlier days. 
His third message involved focusing 
on the CMU and Pittsburgh bond. As

The Ford Foundation recently granted 
CMU $475,000 to help a number of Latin 
American, Asian, and African universi
ties use information technology in teach
ing situations. The grant monies will be 
used to send faculty members to univer
sities in these regions to conduct sympo

The idea is that there are rapid 
changes in technology that may impact 
how learning and teaching occur in the 
university setting, said director of the
Institute for Strategic Development and 
professor of Industrial Administration 
Paul Goodman. Its a strategy for glo
balizing the University.
The seminars will focus on helping 
university decision makers implement 
new technology into existing teaching 
methods. We want to help them make 
strategic decisions about what kinds of 
technology is available, said Goodman.

Pakistanis attack 
U.S. businessmen
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP)Four U.S. 
businessmen and a Pakistani were killed 
when gunmen in a car forced their ve
hicle off a road early Wednesday in 
Karachi and riddled the victims with 
bullets, police said. Details of the shoot
ing were sketchy but authorities said 
the Americans were auditors who worked 
for a Houston-based oil company, Union 
Texas Petroleum. While the company 
and U.S. Embassy declined to release 
names or identities of the victims pend
ing notification of next of kin, the com
pany said it was evacuating all 30 of its 
foreign personnel immediately.
Police in the violence-wracked south
ern port said a red car carrying two men 
came up behind the vehicle in which the 
Americans were riding, fired on them, 
then forced the car off the road. The 
assailants then sprayed the vehicle at 
close range with about a dozen bullets. 
Everyone in the car died on the spot, 
Karachi Police Chief Malik Iqbal said.
No one has claimed responsibility for 
the killings but they came two days after 
a Pakistani, Mir Aimal Kasi, was con
victed in a U.S. court of fatally shooting 
two CIA agents in January 1993 outside 
the agencys Washington headquarters.
On Tuesday, the U.S. State Depart
ment issued a warning to Americans in 
the region to watch out for possible re
taliation as a result of the conviction.
It is premature to say why they were 
killed, but there is a strong possibility 
that it was linked to Kasis conviction 
and sentencing, Iqbal said.
Prosecutors claim Kasi, who also 
wounded three others in the shooting, was 
out to avenge the bombing of Iraq and 
American meddling in Muslim countries.
No one has been arrested in connec tion with the recent killings.
Teens company 
sells for millions
SYDNEY, Australia (AP)At age 17, 
Alex Hartman swaps email with Bill 
Gates, and could be poised to follow in the 
footsteps of the Microsoft entrepreneur.
Australias national telephone com
pany, Telstra, has just signed a deal
with Hartman for the rights to his new 
software, InfiNET, which allows access 
to the Internet with one click of a button, 
according to a report Saturday in the 
Sydney Morning Herald.
I think this will do the same thing for 
the Internet as the remote control did 
for TV, the paper quoted Hartman as 
saying. About a third of Australian 
households have personal computers, 
but most people use them mainly to 
play games, followed by uses for busi
ness and homework.
Only a small minority access the 
Internet, which Telstra is actively 
trying to promote. Apparently many 
people are deterred from using the 
Internet by the complicated process 
of logging on, punching security 
codes, waiting for connections to be 
established, and other delays. 
Hartmans program does away with 
most of the delays.
Telstras general manager of cable ser
vices, Judy Slatyer, had combed the 
world seeking improved Internet access 
programs, but finally found what she 
was seeking in her own backyard, in the 
Sydney suburb of Mosman.
Our initial reaction to Alex is that 
this looks great and this kid is going to 
go a long way, she said.
While he was persuading Telstra to 
buy his software, the telephone com
pany was sending executives over to his 
high school to pick him up and take him 
to the negotiations.
The Morning Herald described the sale 
as a million-dollar deal, but there were 
no precise figures on its value.
Floods submerge 
Somali farmlands
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)Heavy 
rain pounded Ethiopia again Saturday, 
feeding the overflowing rivers that have 
killed some 2,000 people and are threat
ening to create an inland sea in southern 
Somalia. A month of flooding has inun
dated large areas of southern Somalia 
between the Ethiojpian border and the 
Indian Ocean. High water has wiped out 
the freshly harvested staple crop of sor
ghum and left hundreds of thousands 
homeless and hungry.
The death toll is rising so fast that aid 
agencies can only guess at the carnage.
David Neff, CAREs director for Soma
lia, said any estimate below 2,000 dead 
has got to be conservative.
He said the Juba River, which origi
nates in Ethiopia and runs south to the 
Somali port of Kismayo, is now eight 
miles wide at some points.
The Red Cross has been making 
twice-a-day deliveries of high-protein 
biscuits and plastic sheeting, landing 
at the few airstrips in Somalia that 
were still above water.
Pilots have spotted families stuck for 
days in trees. Many other bits of high 
ground will be completely wiped out if 
the floods rise just a few feet more.
Ten more days of rain are forecast for 
Ethiopia, the origin of the overflowing 
Shabelle river.
According to the Somali Flood Response 
office, an estimated 210,000 people have 
fled their homes, and there was fear that 
the Juba and the Shabelle might merge 
to create an inland sea covering 60 square 
miles. The U.N. World Food Program 
said more than 148,200 acres of prime 
farm land were underwater.
UNICEF spokeswoman Lynn Geldof 
said agencies had received pledges of 
about half the $9.6 billion needed.
Town in Georgia 
forgets elections
BACONTON, Ga. (AP)  Sometimes 
elected officials in small towns forget to 
pay a bill or update employment records.
In this southern Georgia town, they 
forgot to hold an election. I guess 
sometimes in these little itty-bitty

Coleman said Wednesday.

election. I just didnt think, said Tim 
Pinson, a longtime city councilman in 
Baconton, about 60 miles north of Talla
hassee, Fla. What can I tell you? We 
just messed up.

385 registered voters have cast ballots 
in local elections because the candidates 
have been unopposed. In Georgia, a slate 
of candidates can be confirmed without 
an election if they are unopposed.
Experts say EF Au Pair will face civil suit for the death of baby
BOSTON (AP)  How does 
someone making $135 a week get 
some of the best lawyers and 
medical experts in the world?
In Louise Woodwards case, 
from the au pair agency that 
brought her to America. And EF 
Au Pairs expenses probably have 
not come to an end. The agency 
may also have to defend itself.
A jury convicted the 19-yearold British au pair of second-degree murder for the death of 8- 
month-old Matthew Eappen, but 
Judge Hiller B. Zobel reduced the 
conviction to involuntary man
slaughter Monday and set her 
free. The time she had spent in 
jail since her February 5 arrest
 279 days in all  was punish
ment enough, the judge ruled.
The au pair agency wont say 
how much it has spent on Ms. 
Woodwards defense, but legal 
experts estimate it was at least 
$500,000. The agency has said it 
stepped in because Ms. Wood
ward couldnt afford to mount a 
defense, and that EF Au Pair 
would pay for her appeals.
But some have suggested EF 
Au Pair intervened to protect 
its own interests. The agency 
could end up paying far more if 
the babys parents, Sunil and 
Deborah Eappen, sue the agency 
in civil court. The Eappens, who 
could not be located for com
ment, have not indicated 
whether they will sue. But legal 
experts said they have a com
pelling wrongful-death case 
one that could cost EF Au Pair 
tens of millions of dollars.
The agency maintains it re
viewed Ms. Woodwards creden
tials, checked her references and 
properly trained her for the de
mands of looking after children.
EF Au Pair has said that it has 
no liability and that the Eappens, 
both doctors, chose to leave Ms. 
Woodward alone with their chil
dren. The Eappens, however, tes
tified they had quarreled with the 
teen-ager over her late hours and 
what they thought were lapses in 
duty. We have acted at all times in 
a responsible and professional way 
and therefore we have no case to 
answer, EF Au Pair said in a 
statement. EF Au Pair, which is 
based in Cambridge, has denied
trying to protect itself by pressur
ing Ms. Woodward and her de
fense attorneys to push for an allor-nothing legal strategy that of
fered the jury a choice of convicting 
her of murder or acquitting her.
Some have speculated the au 
pair agency faced less civil liability 
if Woodward were convicted of 
murder as opposed to manslaugh
ter, which suggests that the au 
pair agency could have been negli
gent in not training her properly.
But legal experts said the po
tential for a civil suit would be 
the same no matter the verdict. 
And Ms. Woodwards attorneys 
could have gotten themselves dis
barred if they had schemed with 
EF Au Pair in a way that put the 
interests of the au pair agency
ahead of the defendants.
Even if Ms. Woodward were ac
quitted, the agency could still be 
sued for the babys death. That 
happened in the case of a Swiss au 
pair who was acquitted in 1992 of 
burning to death a suburban New 
York baby. Despite the acquittal, 
the babys parents brought a multimillion-dollar lawsuit in 1994 
against EF Au Pair.
If the Eappens do sue, their 
attorneys might try to show that 
EF Au Pair was negligent in ac
cepting her, that it failed to prop
erly train her, or that it did not 
anticipate a young woman could 
crack under the pressure of car
ing for children, said Jeffrey 
Newman, a lawyer who repre
sents victims of violent crimes.

50 YEARS AGO, January 13,

attempted to get the results of the

overturned because of a supposed 
Council Constitution violation. 
However, the reason for the pro

ent. The reason for the protest was 
that the Engineering and Fine Arts

was due to The Tartan not publish

the elections, and booths that 
closed down early.
10 YEARS AGO, November

Council (IFC) voted to place Al

for a fighting incident that re
sulted in the injury of several 
Delta Upsilon brothers. While the 
Chief IFC Court Justice felt that 
no action should be taken against 
ATO for any particular incident, 
something should be done con
cerning the whole night. In addi

University inducts new president
INAUGURATION, from page 1
Cohon noted, Our success and stature 
as a University are linked to Pittsburghs 
fortunes.... Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon would also benefit from more 
collaboration among its universities. 
Cohon addressed the need for 
CMU and the city to take on a more 
global perspective.
CMU should celebrate its successes 
and realize its fall potential, he said. 
This is an exciting time for Carnegie 
Mellon. As we meet here today, this 
university stands as one of the most 
remarkable success stories in 20th cen
tury American higher education. And 
we are poised to go much further. 
Cohon also provided the audience with 
a look back at former President 
Mehrabians term.
President Mehrabian brought re
newed emphasis on teaching and stu
dent life, added new facilities and reno
vated old ones, and put in place an excel
lent administration, said Cohon.
Though it was a formal ceremony, 
there were also a few laughs. For in
stance, one of the speakers, President of 
MIT Charles Vest, advised Cohon, This 
is as good as it gets, Jared, so make the 
most of it.
As an accomplished and experienced 
academic administrator, you already 
know the truth of George F. Wills ob
servation that a university is a collec
tion of mutually repellent individuals 
held together only by a common inter
est in parking.
Yet, Vest also had some more serious 
advice for Cohon. Without conceding 
for a moment the importance of aca
demic rigor and independence, I also 
believe that it is time for universities to 
anchor themselves somewhat more 
firmly with industry, said Vest.
Besides the actual induction of Presi
dent Cohon, the ceremony was used as 
an occasion for the announcement of 
five new CMU scholarships for Pitts
burgh students. The presentation of

(1990-97) enjoy a laugh together at last Mondays inauguration ceremony.
the scholarships, made to Mayor Tom 
Murphy, mirrored the presentation of 
Andrew Carnegies letter to the Pitts
burgh mayor in November 1900 
whereby he established the forerunner 
of Carnegie Mellon through a $1 mil
lion endowment.
You [Cohon] come at an exciting, but 
challenging time when the very soul of 
Pittsburgh is being transformed, said 
Murphy. Carnegie Mellon has been a 
wonderful partner in the building of this 
city, and we look forward to that contin
ued support.
Last Mondays inaugural event was 
the first dedicated inauguration cer
emony since that of President Cyert. 
Former President Mehrabians inaugu
ration was combined with the gradua
tion ceremony.
In an interview following the event, 
former President Mehrabian advised
that President Cohon plot his own fu
ture course.
Ive always had one [piece of] advice 
for the new president  dont take ad
vice from ex-presidents.
H. Guyford Stever, who was presi
dent when Carnegie Tech became 
Carnegie Mellon University in 1967, 
said in an interview that he was pleased 
with what he saw on his trip back to 
CMU for the event.
I think, first of all, this is a superb 
celebration and its gone awfully well. 
There is such a good spirit about it. The 
quality of Carnegie Mellon and its pre
decessor Carnegie Tech is very well 
known  Its been kept up; its been 
growing steadily. That is being reaf
firmed here. But I also feel there is an 
extra sense of community right now 
and I have a feeling that Dr. Cohon will 
just pull this off very well.Foundation funds education network

countries to discuss decision mak
ing, implementation, and assessment 
of teaching technologies. Speakers 
from CMU and other universities dis
cussed new developments and re

ods, said Goodman.
Technology is changing how teaching 
occurs, he said. Examples of technologi
cally-advanced teaching and learning 
methods that are currently used in CMU 
classrooms include internet-based courses, 
multimedia tools, and video conferencing.
CMU has taught engineering classes

[We want to help these universities] 
to examine what technological options 
are available, how they influence learn
ing and how universities may have to 
change how they utilize specific tech
nologies, he said.
Student Senate Minutes
Senate budgetary policy faces revision
POLICY, from page 1
ing of how organizations felt about the 
current policy.
One issue raised at the meeting was 
the fact that currently, student orga
nizations are not allowed to use Activi
ties Fee funds to purchase food for 
meetings or events. When GSA split 
from Senate, no changes were made to 
the existing policy which allowed the 
GSA social committee to spend money 
on food and travel. This raised the 
question of whether Student Senate 
would be amended to fit the GSA model.
It would be very easy for organiza
tions to pad their 
budgets with line 
items for food, said 
Neil Donnelly, gen
eral manager of 
WRCT and a junior 
materials and sci
ence engineering 
major. However, 
some exceptions 
could be made for 
special cases, like 
food for bands or 
speakers that organizations bring to 
campus. This would have to be dealt 
with on a case by case basis.
An organization buying food for 
one of their meetings in most cases is 
something that could happen without 
the Activities Fee being involved, 
said Krug. The people who were eat
ing could just pay [for it] themselves.
Krug added, however, that certain 
organizations like Amnesty Interna
tional are not able to pay for food, while 
others like the Activities Board can pay 
for it with natural income  money 
they obtain as a natural result of how 
they function as an organization.
The other concern raised at the meet
ing was the fact that, under current fiscal 
policy, student organizations are not al
lowed to retain leftover money in their 
budgets atthe end oftheyear. The money 
goes into the Master Activities Fee Accountto be distributed the folio wingy ear.
I think that allowing organiza
tions to keep the remainder of their
budget at the end of the year would 
make them spend money more 
wisely, said Donnelly.
If this change is made, it will revo
lutionize the way organizations are 
structured and the way they plan, 
said Mookeijee. It will also entirely 
change the efficiency of organiza
tional accounting.... It reduces the 
extensive useless spending that oc
curs at the end of each fiscal year 
among groups that have money left
over just to use it up [and] instead 
allows for useful spending of sur
pluses at an opportune time.
Its been awhile since this 
policy's really been reviewed, 
and since it was written things 
have changed on campus. 
 Bryon Krug 
____________student body president
I would say that most organiza
tions are not [wasting money at the 
end of the year], said Krug. But it is 
occurring in some organizations, and 
any frivolous use of Activities Fee 
money is too much.
The newly formed fiscal policy com
mission will consist of eight to 12 
senators, student organizational 
leaders, and members of the general 
student body.
The committee will look not only at 
the specific issues but on the policy as 
a whole, said Krug. Its been awhile 
since this policys really been reviewed, 
and since it was written things have 
changed on campus, he said.
Krug hopes that the committee will 
be formed and meet for the first time 
this week. The plan is for the commit
tee to report back with a recommen
dation at the beginning of next semes
ter, so that if changes to the policy do 
occur, they will be in place in time for 
Senate budgeting in the spring.

Last Monday, Andy Richter came. 
It was a free show. About 1200 
people came. There are mixed 
responses towards this. Last Fri

back on this. Henry Rollins will 
be coming next Wednesday at

people asking for an excess 
amount of tickets to free events 
and then not showing up.
Graduate Student Assembly 
(Grant Bromhal): We are still 
working on the possibility of a 
free Squirrel Hill shuttle, and 
this topic was discussed at our 
last meeting. There are three op
tions: (1) a university shuttle, (2) 
have it contracted out, or (3) make 
a deal w/ PAT. This issue should 
be resolved by mid-December. 
GSA has also passed the amend

New Business from Floor: 
Elaine Foster approved for 
Senator at Large by acclamation.
Motion sponsored by Sen. Gray

Policy Commission. Senate will 
be informed of the names of the 
eight people. This Commission 
will meet next week and will be

Points of Discussion: 
Concern about a regularity in
the absence of an SDC report. 
Some senators feel that it is im
portant to hear SDC reports and 
if the SDC president is unable to 
attend a Senate meeting, then 
SDC should send a suitable rep
resentative. Chair Will Toraason 
will speak to SDC President Brian 
Bluth, but senators may email 
SDC or the SDC bboard about 
their concerns.
In regards to the MLK Jr. clari
fication, does Senate have an 
opinion on who should be sent 
this? Senate will allow President 
Krug to decide. 
Announcements:
There is a meeting next week 
on Thursday in the Adamson 
Wing at 5 pm.
Meeting adjourned 6:33 pm.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University17 November 1997CMU isolates offcampus students
When students choose to live off 
campus it is generally understood 
that they are making a trade-off 
they give up dorm life and a short 
walk to class for larger living spaces 
and greater freedom in lifestyle. 
But as it stands, students also face 
another issue when they decide to 
move off campus  lack of proper 
communication with the Univer
sity. Off-campus students fail to 
receive vital information that is 
disseminated to on-campus stu
dents via campus mail and email, 
which often makes them feel like 
outsiders in the campus commu
nity.
Although most off-campus stu
dents try to change their address 
with The HUB each time they 
move, they still fail to receive in
formation pertaining to CMU in a 
timely manner (if they even re
ceive it at all). This information, 
which has included invitations to 
attend President Cohons inaugu
ration, notification of student elec
tions, the schedule of classes, and 
similar on-campus activities, af
fects both on- and off-campus stu
dents, yet off-campus students are 
often left out of such events be
cause they simply do not know 
about them. It is The HUBs re
sponsibility to seek out changes in 
address each semester.
Part of the problem is The HUBs 
current online system for chang
ing addresses. The Web site pro
vides a comments box where stu
dents can type in their new ad
dress, but the procedure is often 
confusing and the information gen
erally fails to be updated.
Although off-campus students 
usually receive email from their 
departments about college or de
partmental activity, much infor
mation that pertains to the en
tire community fails to reach 
them because it is distributed 
through distribution lists (gen
erally divided by housing re
gions), which do not include offcampus students. Students also 
receive information about Stu
dent Life activities through email 
sent by Resident Assistants 
(RAs). RAs inform their desig
nated students of events such as 
target programs on time man
agement, career center work
shops, and sexual assault semi
nars. These types of activities 
are resources for both on- and 
off-campus students, yet because 
off-campus students receive little 
publicity about such events they 
do not attend them. In addition, 
the campus is notified of crime 
arid violence reports through 
postings in dormitory bulletin 
boards, another process that ne
glects to inform off-campus stu
dents of important information.
Because of housing shortages, 
the University often encourages 
upperclassmen to move off-cam
pus, but if they expect this to be an 
attractive option, they need to take 
the appropriate measures to make 
sure off-campus students still re
ceive CMU-related information. By 
failing to communicate properly 
with off-campus students, these 
students miss opportunities that 
available to the entire campus com
munity.Skibo Gym repairs 
need proper funding
For the past four years, the Uni
versity has promised the campus 
community renovations to Skibo 
Gymnasium  intentions that 
seem to have been pushed back in 
the midst of projects such as the 
Purnell Center for the Arts, Rob
erts Hall, and University Center. 
It is not that the administration 
lacks a proper plan of action in 
order to follow through on its prom
ise; what is lacking is appropriate 
funding. The University needs to 
refocus its fundraising measures 
if the gym renovations are to be 
realized in the near future.
The current plan which involves 
six phases, costing $800,000 to $1.2 
million each, has come to a stand 
still because there are not enough 
funds to move the project into the 
second phase. The money was origi
nally supposed to come from a capi
tal surplus fund, meaning that the 
gym renovations would be paid for 
with leftovers from the capital 
budget. But as it stands, a surplus 
occurred in only one year since the 
renovations began. With no sur
plus money currently available, 
the administration should consider 
creating a capital campaign to fund 
the Skibo Gym project.
Skibo Gym fails to meet the needs 
of CMUs sports programs because 
it does not reach some standards 
of athletic facilities for a number 
of varsity sports. A solid athletics 
facility is a mark of a high-caliber 
university, such as CMU. While 
the University Centers Wiegand 
Gymnasium meets the needs of 
students wishing to participate in 
informal sports activities, it does

Jeff Thibert
not conform to regulation size and 
thus cannot house all varsity 
sports. Potential students and vis
iting schools often judge the qual
ity of student life at a university in 
part by the quality of the athletics 
facilities provided there. Carrying 
through on the planned renova
tions does not just mean improv
ing facilities at CMU, but it also 
means the schools overall image. 
By putting the money into an at
tractive and competitive gym, the 
University will convey the mes
sage that CMU students repre
sent more than just academic ex
cellence.
Although the UC holds an im
pressive athletics space, Skibo gym 
is still used by many students, 
especially athletes since Wiegand 
is not regulation-sized. As the larg
est athletic facility on campus, it 
does not only provide space for 
varsity sports, but it is also in
tended for physical education 
classes, club sports, and individual 
student use. In addition, concerts 
such as They Might Be Giants re
cent visit to campus would have 
been better received in a larger 
space such as Skibo Gym if the 
proper refurbishings were in place.
By raising money for Skibo Gym 
renovations through a capital cam
paign, the administration can 
stress the importance of such im
provements. But until adequate 
fundraising occurs, Skibo will re
main a second-rate athletics facil
ity  and CMU will continue to 
slight sports programs and hence 
the quality of student life on cam
pus.
Ive heard it said that we 
never really know what we 
have until its gone. Well, Id 
like to amend that statement 
slightly. I think itd be more 
accurate if we said that we 
never know what we have un
til its threatened.
Many people take the right 
to vote for granted (gratu
itous Election Day refer
ence), but if the government 
started to think about tak
ing it away, I bet that every
body would get rather up
set, even those of us who 
dont even use that right.
I dont plan to talk about 
the right to vote, but about 
how we often take our bless
ings for granted and about 
how we dont recognize them 
for what they are until 
theres a chance that they 
might be snatched away.
A friend of mine is cur
rently in a coma. Shes been 
showing many signs of im
provement, and she should 
be all right eventually, but 
for now, shes still comatose.
Ill admit, dealing with it 
has been somewhat difficult 
But its times like these
(have I ever really had a 
time like this before?) that 
my faith in God becomes 
more important than ever. 
If I didnt believe in a God, 
or some sort of purpose, Id 
probably be cursing the 
world right now, lamenting 
its cruelty and complete un
fairness. Without some sort 
of hope in Eternity, Id be quite 
bitter indeed.
Thankfully, though, I do
the whole thing.This whole 
incident has made me realize 
just how important she was to 
me. I sincerely hope that I 
havent taken her friendship 
for granted, and, further, its 
made me realize just how many 
things all of us most decidedly 
do take for granted.
This sounds overly senti
mental, perhaps, but at least 
once a day, we really need to 
thank God, or barring the...we need to thank the people 
in our lives that make them the 
wonderful things that they are. 
place faith in a god, and some 
Meaning, and some Afterlife, 
and this makes coping easier.
I cope by telling myself that 
it must have happened for a 
reason and that, whatever 
ends up happening, Gods will 
shall be done and my friend 
will be better off.
Either way, shes out of 
the coma  one way, shes 
in Heaven (which is defi
nitely better than a coma), 
and the other, shes back 
with us (which is also better 
than a coma, or so I would 
think). And that keeps me 
somewhat optimistic about
ism, at least be glad that we 
have it as well as we do be
cause everybody in this world 
has it better than somebody 
else. And if you argue with 
that, then you really dont 
understand what it is to be a 
human being.
Besides thanking God (or 
showing our gratitude in some 
way), though, we need to thank 
the people in our lives that 
make them the wonderful 
things that they are.
I know that, next time I 
talk to my friend, Im going 
to tell, her just how impor-' 
tantsheistome. Im going to
make sure that she knows. 
Im also going to make sure, 
in the future, that all my 
friends and family know how 
much I care about them.
I shouldnt have to wait 
until a crisis, and this holds 
for all of us, whether youre 
free with your emotions or 
not. Virtually everyone out 
there has at least one per
son whom they love dearly, 
and most have some higher 
entity in which they believe. 
If you havent done it re
cently, thank them now, and 
make sure they know how 
you feel about them.
Itll make you both hap
pier, and although the 
higher entity might be 
around forever, your loved 
ones might not.
If you dont get a chance 
to tell them what they mean 
to you, you could regret it 
for a long time.
Trust me; it took a crisis 
in order for me to realize 
this. I hope it doesnt take 
the same for you.

man in the University 
Choice Program, and wel
comes your prayers and 
best wishes for his friend.

What is the point of college if you cant 
get the classes that you want, and thus 
learn what you deem important? If I am 
a computer science major, I dont want 
to be forced to take Introduction to 
Acting because everybody has already 
snatched up the CS or CS-related 
classes. Registration is a sensitive is
sue with pressing concerns.
Now that CMU has decided tobring 
registration to the network (who would 
have thought?), the situation is even 
more complicated.
Or is it simplified? In essence, or 
rather in theory, now that we can reg
ister on the Web, there is no need to go 
through the grueling and tiresome 
process of The RAD Form.
The previous method of registration, 
which explicitly relied on the RAD 
form, required us to run all over cam
pus to offices that were often buried in 
buildings we never knew existed.
More often than not, we would fi
nally arrive in these dark and dubious 
offices and find out that some portion 
of the slip was wrong, or permission 
was required from the dean of X, or 
that the class was filled up, or what
ever, all of which rendered our quest 
to the unknown fruitless (and class
less for that matter).
By taking a simple stroll down to 
any of the fabulous clusters here on
campus, we can log on and register, 
without the extraneous exercise and 
effort that the RAD form required.
In addition, students who have to 
register between colleges now do not 
have to be subject to the discrepancies 
that are found in separate depart
ments. The differences are equalized 
by every student having to deal with 
the same process.
Not to mention the reduction of pa
per waste that should result, which 
computerized bureaucracies always 
happen to incur.
All of this is very positive, but inevi
tably, with the good comes the bad.
As with any computer-driven process, 
the problems that could arise are end
less. Additionally, when they do arise, 
they cannot be immediately resolved; 
rather, a more complicated reprogram
ming process has to ensue.
Of course, I havent given The HUB 
^ run for its money yet, since freshjnen can only register on the 20th, but 
I have tested out some of its related 
features involving class schedules and 
course descriptions. While trying to 
maneuver through these initial steps, 
the evidence was clear that the pro
cess was not infallible.
Often, when I would click on a class 
title, expecting its description to follow, 
I would get the description of another, 
totally unrelated class.
Sometimes the description wouldnt 
come up at all either the computer 
never found the corresponding descrip
tion and would continue searching with 
no results, or I would get an error 
saying that my requests were invalid. 
This situation is neither pleasant nor
desirable, and by the time it was fixed 
I could have looked through the cata
log anyhow.
I anticipate this sort of problem can 
similarly arise with the actual registra
tion. Although it may be finer-tuned to 
run smoothly for its debut performance, 
the fact remains that computers are not 
perfect.Their imperfection extends into 
other problematic realms as well. The 
fact that now our interaction will be 
with a computer instead of a person is o 
questionable worth.
Regardless of all the recommendations 
urging us to retain contact with our 
advisors, the advisor-student relation
ship is inevitably going to be severely 
affected, and negatively so.
Personally, all of the advisor interac
tion that I have received here at CMU 
has been quite positive (in comparison 
to high school and otherwise) and served 
more as a pleasant meeting than as t 
burden of any sort.
So, the potential, and what seems in
evitable, violation of that relationship is 
ultimately going to be a downfall, de
spite our newly-added convenience.
Registration is undoubtedly a significant issue, and this new innovation has 
its benefits and drawbacks.
Yet, any criticism at this point will 
remain a speculation. For now, the ulti
mate impact that such a measure could 
have upon the workings of an important 
aspect of college life should be consid
ered more deeply by students and fac
ulty alike.

Nanny verdict sparks heated debate
Nanny deserves punishment
David Liber
Last week brought an end to the infa
mous Nanny Murder Trial of British 
au pair Louise Woodward, who was found 
guilty of second degree murder by a 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts jury, 
and then set free by the judge on a 
reduced sentence of involuntary man
slaughter with time served (thus releas
ing Woodward out to care for more 
American kids). Now, I do not wish to 
debate whether or not she was actually 
guilty; Barry Sheck and Johnny 
Cochrain have done that enough for me 
to stomach. Lets presume she did com
mit this awful crime. The debate here is 
whether or not Americans were able to 
honor the natural rights of a child or if 
they were too easily persuaded by a 
grieving teenager.
The bitching and moaning Americans 
like to do about our failing judicial sys
tem quickly stopped when poor inno
cent Woodward actually looked like she 
might be going to jail. People joined 
together to sing Kumbaya outside the 
courthouse in a candlelight vigil, rib
bons were worn, and Court TV was 
there 24/7 for Woodward as she faced 
possible life in prison.
I wonder if these people actually be
lieve this child deserved it? Lets face it: 
he was a crying, colicky, snobby little 
brat who probably deserved to be pushed 
around a little by his wonderful Mary 
Poppins au pair. Right?
Americans quickly forgot about the 
baby boy whose body was shaken like a 
can of paint and whose small delicate 
head was slammed down on a rock-hard 
kitchen counter by Woodward, or was 
that not the case?
Maybe this was a difficult child (as 
most children are at that age) who needed 
more attention than his parents were 
physically able to give him and more 
than Woodward was emotionally pre
pared to give. This is a case of a 19-yearold au pair who was in way over her 
head, and a child who was abused be
cause of that.
This still does not excuse Woodwards 
actions. No matter how difficult a child
may be, there is no excuse for abusing a 
child, especially a defenseless baby. The 
Bible may make reference to not sparing 
the rod, but it makes no mention of using 
a Coriander kitchen counter. Possibly we 
need to be reminded that this country is 
based upon the protection of the three 
natural rights Locke gave us, the first 
being Life.
We should weep for Woodward, as her 
story is tragic. However, we should not 
forget that there is a child lying in a 
Massachusetts grave because of WoodJury lacked enough evidence
Rebecca Fribush
Justice was served last week in a 
suburban Massachusetts courtroom. 
In a courageous move, Judge Hiller 
Zobel reduced the conviction of au pair 
Louise Woodward from murder to in
voluntary manslaughter. In doing so, 
he remained true to the key legal tenet 
of reasonable doubt.
ward. He has been robbed of one of his 
natural rights, and thus, Woodward 
should be punished.
We should not have been so forgiving 
as to have allowed Woodward to walk 
out of that Massachusetts courthouse a 
free woman.
Yes, possibly a life sentence would 
have been too harsh, but sentencing 
Ms. Woodward to at least a year in 
prison would not have been and would 
have reminded her to at least be a little 
more gentle next time.

The death of baby Matthew Eappen 
was tragic and unfair. Yet condemning 
Woodward to years in jail for murder 
in the absence of compelling evidence 
that she knowingly killed him, as the 
jury intended to, would have been 
tragic as a failure of the American 
judicial system and unfair to Wood
ward herself. Louise Woodward was a 
young girl alone in a strange country. 
Her entire education in how to deal 
with taking care of children consisted 
of a whopping four days of training 
with EF, an au pair placement agency.
With this lack of knowledge about 
childrens health, is it any wonder she 
had no idea what to do when she tried
to rouse Matthew from his nap one day 
and found he wouldnt awaken?
Woodward herself and her defense con
tended that, in her frenzy and confusion, 
she shook him slightly in an attempt to 
wake him up, and the momentum made 
him hit his head on a hard surface on the 
way down.
One might wonder what kind of 
agency trains its au pairs so perfunc
torily that they dont realize that shak
ing a baby is hardly a stroke of bril
liance and are unable to remain calm 
in the face of an emergency.
But EFs failure to adequately prepare 
the people that parents entrust with the 
lives and well-being of their children 
implies that, if one wants to lay blame in 
this case, the guilty party was certainly 
not Louise Woodward.
Its unjust to charge her with mali
ciously murdering her young charge if 
she may have only acted out of monu
mental cluelessness.
Woodwards attorneys provided rea
sonable doubt that she knowingly 
harmed Matthew Eappen. Besides show
ing that her training was inadequate 
and, thus, she could reasonably main
tain that she didnt know any better, her 
defense team demonstrated that 
Matthews injuries did not match those 
that would have been seen on a harshly 
battered baby. One doctor who had tried to 
revive Matthew testified that he didnt 
have any bruises, as he would have if 
shaken violently.
Another one presented possible signs 
that Matthew may have died due to aggra
vation of an earlier unhealed head injury. 
If Woodward had intended to kill Mat
thew, its rational to assume she would 
have shaken him hard enough to leave 
bruises and tried to hit him with enough 
force that the blow would have killed 
him without the benefit of prior injury.
There are ample grounds for doubt 
that she intentionally tried to kill Mat
thew Eappen.
The defense presented a plausible pic
ture of a tragic accidental death. There
fore, Judge Zobel did the only just thing 
in setting Woodward free.

James Stepanek
Just this past week, Clinton 
was handed one of the greatest 
defeats of his Presidency.
It was not, however, done by 
the Republicans. This was the 
downing of the fast track 
trade negotiation authority re
newal by the Democrats in the 
House of Representatives. 
This agreement is essentially 
a deal offered to the President 
by Congress. The President is 
granted the ability to negoti
ate trade deals which Con
gress will only approve or dis
approve, not amend.
Its rather like a statement of 
trust in Presidential judgement, 
and it has been a standard policy 
since the days of Gerald Ford. 
After a furious period of dealing
and arm-twisting, Clinton and 
his cronies'failed to bring around 
enough people in the House to 
support this power. The extent to 
which he tried to secure this au
thority prompted some ridicule 
even in Congress.
The ranking party members 
were even publicly making jokes 
about the way Clinton was dis
pensing largess. All the armtwisting was for naught because 
the vast majority of people in his 
own party appear not to trust 
him. Considering his track record, 
how can you blame them?
A couple of columns back I men
tioned that a smoking gun had 
been obtained in the campaign 
finance issue.
This is currently being investi
gated by a House committee. If 
they have any competence, the 
blatant disregard for the law 
should be actionable.
Well, interestingly enough, a
smoking gun has emerged on 
another front. It also did it in a 
truly remarkable fashion.
It appears that an abandoned 
car in Arkansas was hit by a 
tornado which jarred open the 
trunk. In the trunk was a collec
tion of old documents pertaining 
to the Madison Savings and Loan. 
This was the company run by 
James McDougal, a Clinton crony 
from his days as Arkansas Gov
ernor. McDpugal is currently in 
jail for criminal acts pertaining 
to his running of this savings and 
loan business, which defaulted. 
After McDougal was convicted, 
he decided to cooperate with the 
Whitewater special prosecutor 
and has spilled the beans.
However, since the man is a 
convicted felon, a bit more than 
his word is necessary to make a 
convincing case. Documentary 
evidence is needed, and the pa
pers found in the trunk of the
tornado-struck car seem to be 
providing that evidence. During 
the McDougal trial, Clinton tes
tified, via videotape, that he had 
neither asked for, nor taken 
money from the Madison Sav
ings and Loan. 
However, in the trunk of the car 
was found a check to Bill Clinton 
from the Madison Savings and 
Loan. It would appear from this 
evidence that Clinton perjured 
himself in front of a federal court. 
This is, of course, illegal.
Also, it is possible that more of 
the documents found in the trunk 
could be of use to investigators. 
At the very least, the check backs 
McDougals claims at the expense 
of Clintons credibility.
One aspect of the Clinton scan
dals that is rather amusing is the 
sheer quantity of them, and how 
their multitude almost serves to 
mask them in the eyes of the 
public. As soon as one criminal
act becomes exposed, another 
appears to divert attention. Its 
like a comedy of errors. One al
most needs a scorecard to keep 
up with the allegations and con
victions of those either in the ad
ministration or part of Clintons 
circle back in Arkansas.
We now have many of the ma
jor newspapers in the country 
seriously investigating allega
tions of criminal acts from the 
current administration. It cant 
be too much longer before it all 
sinks in, and even the broadcast 
news realizes what is going on. 
At that point I imagine that the 
dam will break with the last of 
the defenders leaving Mr. 
Clintons side. This is the point 
Im waiting for quite eagerly.

Simon says slurs, gets suspended
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
All pro athletes are bilingual. They 
speak English and profanity.
Gordie Howe.
Sticks and stones make break my bones 
but names will never hurt me. Words, 
words, words. Trash-talking, cussing 
out  knowing just when to insult the 
opponents mom, girlfriend or sister. But 
using the n 
word doesnt 
fall under 
that category, 
right? Well, this 
week the NHL de
cided so  and issued a 
three-game suspension to 
the Capitals Chris Simon for 
comments he made towards-the 
Oilers Mike Grier, who is black, 
after a close Caps win in Maryland.
Now, in hockey, there is a lot of nasty 
talk on the ice. We swear at refs, we 
swears at coaches, we verbally abuse goal
ies, especially when theyre losing. The 
chants in hockey are cruel and ruthless 
but highly necessary. This is a mental 
game and a lot of people are controlled by 
their emotions. Trash-talking, on a face 
off or after a check, is just another element 
of the sport  and like in the NHL or 
NBA, it is a no holds-barred affair.
Its seems like everyone is coming out
on the side of Grier in this case. The 
NHL commissioners and coaches are all 
lauding the NHL for the suspension 
action after the gross misconduct call on 
Simon. It is very PC. It is very suspect.
Look through the NHL rule-book, I 
keep one next to my bed. There is a 
profanity rule (believe it or not, I think 
probably to protect refs) which carries a 
misconduct penalty if incurred on ice  
a bench minor if coming from the bench. 
But Simon, although no one will say 
directly what he said to Grier, got a 
gross misconduct for comment made 
during the handshaking after the game. 
A gross misconduct carries with a it a 
review by officials  and after they 
examined the words, they slapped on 
the suspension.
There are more complicated issues at 
work here. Hockey, un
like the NFL and
is still a 
predomi
nately white 
port . White Europe
ans, Canadians, Russians, and 
Americans. There are several theories 
on why that is, mostly economic, but 
nonetheless there are only six black play
ers in the league. Among them are Grant 
Fuhr, the man that Mark Messier said 
was born to goaltend, and Boston Bruins 
forward Anson Carter. Carter, who
played with Simon when he was with 
Washington last season, reported never 
having any tension with Simon. Some 
reports even have them rooming together 
on the road. Grier, who was a college 
standout with Boston University, has 
been playing professionally for two years.
Simon is a Native-American, member 
of the Ojibwa tribe from Wawa, Ontario. 
His minority position is even rarer than 
Griers  which is why the slur makes 
even less sense  or maybe more. He 
knows, better than anyone, how to hit 
right between someones eyes with 
words. His well-known brazenness, with 
long hair, unshaven look and cavalier 
attitude about getting prepared for the 
game (he was known to brag about drink
ing and smoking heavily during train
ing camp) just adds to his bad-boy repu
tation. Maybe the NHL saw this com
ment as just the thing to try and smoosh 
him into a white-bread mold.
I think that Simon got caught in the 
mind-set of the game, a close win. It is 
hard to go through the line and shake 
hands with men who only minutes 
before were on the ice 
headhunting for you.
knows, maybe 
Grier, or someone else 
on the Oilers squad, said 
something to provoke Simon, 
to push his buttons just right 
as to make him go off. We dont know.
But, if Simon had gone on the ice and 
busted Griers jaw during a hard check, 
the most he would have been called for 
may have been two minutes for board
ing. Say the forbidden word and you get 
three games? Woah there commish, 
where is the perspective on that one?

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  17 November 199711NBA faces possible decline
The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
I dont think this will be the 
last season the NBA is worth 
watching, but it just might be. 
Michael Jordan is missing his 
best man, Utahs dynamic duo is 
minus its Dream Team point 
guard, and the leagues most ex
citing assist combination (Gary 
Payton to Shawn Kemp) has been 
split up.- Houstons trio of super
stars are superannuated, the best 
teams in the league (Lakers, 
Suns, Spurs, Knicks, Hawks, 
Heat) have yet to gel, a possible 
lock-out next season looms large, 
and from here on out, its possible 
for the leagues best young stars 
to switch from their first team 
before theyve had their first le
gal swig of beer.
Instead of the dominant teams, 
they are more balanced. Parity is 
great if youre a die-hard fan, but 
if you dont want to watch every 
game, it makes it harder to pick 
out the great contests on the 
schedule. Was there parity in the 
80s? Hell no. The Lakers and 
Celtics were in damn near every 
finals series and we liked it.
As the Rockets proved a few 
years back, home-court advan
tage in the playoffs means next to 
nothing in the NBA. Not so in 
football, where the home team in 
the NFC championship usually 
wins that game (and the 
SuperBowl). Less true in base
ball, where the home team actu
ally has a strategic advantage. 
So whats the point of battling all 
season to gain that 
crucial one-game 
home-court ad
vantage in the 
playoffs?
NFL fans witness 
one wild week
The Indianapolis Colts staged the 
biggest upset of the season and the San 
Francisco 49ers clinched the NFC West 
title in Week 12 of the NFL. It was a 
week that featured the first NFL tie in 
eight years, a game-winning 54-yard 
field goal and a 388-yard passing per
formance by a rookie quarterback.
The odds were heavily stacked against 
the previously winless Colts today 
against the Green Bay Packers. Except 
that in each of the last two years, the 
Colts have knocked off the defending 
Super Bowl champion, defeating the 
San Francisco 49ers in 1995 and the 
Dallas Cowboys in 1996. Lightning 
struck for a third time today for the 
Colts (1-10), who earned a stunning 
41-38 win over the Packers when Cary 
Blanchard kicked his fourth field goal 
of the game, a 20-yarder, as time ex
pired this afternoon at the RCA Dome.
Hingis triumphs 
in finals again
Top seed Martina Hingis of Switzer
land geared up for the upcoming Chase 
Championships by outlasting fifthseeded American Lindsay Davenport, 
7-5, 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-4) today to win
In the Chi
cago Bulls five champion
ships, theyve never played in 
a game seven in the finals.
It used to be fun to 
watch rookies come 
into the NBA and 
take the league by 
storm. Nowa
days the
young- james Mojonnler/Tartan sters grab
garbage time at the end of games.
Or the good ones play away fr 
losing clubs. The past four rook
ies of the year (Allen Iverson,
Damon Stoudamire, Jason Kidd 
and Grant Hill, and Chris 
Webber) have won one playoff 
series in their combined 13 NBA 
seasons. Anyone willing to hand 
the rookie-of-the-year crown to 
Tim Duncan should hold off. A 
pair of guards (Denvers Bobby 
Jackson and Bostons Chauncy 
Billups) may get hot. Not that 
gg the $450,000 Advanta Championship 
tennis event in Philadelphia.
Hingis needed three sets to win all 
four of her matches en route to her 12th 
WTA Tour title of the year and a firstprize check of $79,000. The 17-year-old 
Hingis, who improved to 77^4 this sea
son, will be the top seed at the seasonending event in New York, Monday.
Hingis picked up her third victory in 
four meetings with Davenport this 
season. Davenport handed Hingis one 
of four defeats this season in the semi
finals of the Acura Classic in August. 
But Hingis routed Davenport in the 
U.S. Open semifinals en route to her 
third Grand Slam title of 1997.
it matters what new players do; 
now we watch rookie coaches run 
the show.
Whats up with Boston? Four 
of coach/president Rick Pitinos 
starters are from his champi
onship Kentucky team and the 
fifth is his top draft-pick this 
year (Billups).
This isnt all just bitter rum
blings. Some legitimate bad stuff 
is on the horizon. Jordan may re
tire this year. You dont even want 
to know about the money. Forget 
inflated salaries and 
rising ticket prices. 
The NBA just signed a 
$2.64 billion, four-year
TV deal with NBC and 
Turner Sports. Why is 
that bad?
Because the owners 
get the money up front 
(at least next year), and 
when a lockout happens, 
they will be sitting pretty. 
The NBA is the only ma
jor professional sport 
ArtCo-Editor not to experience a work stoppage, but its 
happening. Maybe not today, 
maybe not tomorrow or next year; 
but someday, soon, and for the 
rest of the season. Which may not 
be such a bad idea.
Chris Cannon is a computer 
science major, film and media 
studies minor who believes Ar
mageddon is coming to the NBA. 
Please choose sides. He hopes the 
Kid F basketball player here 
makes your day a bit brighter.

Teams split dual meet
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor 
& CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
CMUs swim teams got off to 
yeet another rocket start in Sat
urday nights double dual meet 
with Johns Hopkins and Franklin 
& Marshall.
The womens 200-yard realy 
broke the record [set] at the 
UAAs, said sophomore Erin 
Rockwell. That was an exciting 
way to start the meet.
The team of Rockwell and fresh
men Rebecca Hildebrand, Mel
issa Schmelzer, and Julie Tseng 
set a new school record in a time
of 1:56.20. The -------------------
team has set a 
new record in 
the first event in 
all three meets 
this season.
I think we 
did pretty well 
from where we 
are in the sea
son right now, Schmelzer said. 
The relays had a really good 
showing this weekend.
Johns Hopkins has always 
been tough competition for us, so 
we knew going in that they would 
give us good competition, said 
junior Michelle Kondo. JHs 
womens team was second in 
UAAs last year and eighth at 
nationals. Their mens team won 
UAAs and were one of the top five 
teams in the nation.
This year we came a lot 
closer to beating them, said 
freshman Jon Alpert. JH beat 
the CMU men 120-89 and the 
women 112-99. CMUs men 
beatFranklin & Marshall 122- 
69 and the women won 126.5- 
72.5. Both teams now have a 2- 
2 record.
Highlights of the meet in
clude Rockwell winning the 
100-breast in 1:10.79, Tsengs 
second place finishes in the 200 
and 100-free, and Skulys sec
ond place in the 100-backstroke 
and third in the 200-free. 
Schmelzer won the 1000-free 
in 10:50.16 and was second in 
the 100-fly (1:01.82).
We go on a lot of road trips. Its 
hard to get off the bus and just show 
up at the pool and kick some ass." 
junior Michelle Kondo
She is really talented, said 
Kondo. Her times are just 
short of national cuts.
Jake McGuire was impres
sive, said head coach David 
Belowich. McGuire won both 
the 50-free (21.56) and the 100- 
free (47.77). Mike Robinson was 
second in the 100-free and third 
in the 200-free.
The mens 200-free relay 
team of McGuire, senior Mike 
Foster, Alpert, and Robinson
won in a time of 1:27.48.,
Most of the second and third 
place to the JH team were vic
tories of F&M.
We just pulled together, 
said Tseng, of the record-break
ing relay team.
The teams greatest strength 
this season is definitely the 
depth, said Alpert. The team 
is made up of a lot of good 
individual swimmers. We have 
alotofuniity. Whenever some
one swims in an event, every
one goes to the end of the pool 
and cheers. Thats one of the 
reasons were going to be good 
this year.
One of our strengths was
------------------ encouraging
each other a 
lot, said 
Rockwell. We 
didnt fall off a 
lot. We kept it 
going until the 
end.
After al
ready travel
ing to three meets away this 
season, theTartans are look
ing forward to hosting another 
home meet.
We go on a lot of road trips, 
said Kondo. Its hard to get off 
the bus and just show up at the 
pool and kick some ass.
The teams swim against 
Emory and Case Western Re
serve Saturday at 1 pm in the 
UC pool.
Sampras takes 
eighth final win
Top-seeded American Pete Sampras 
capped off his fifth straight season as 
the world's number one player by storm
ing past sixth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
of Russia, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, today to win 
the ATP Tour World Championship in 
Hannover, Germany.
Sampras has earned over $5.6 mil
lion in 1997, which is an ATP Tour 
record, surpassing his own record of 
over $5.4 million in earnings in 1995. 
Sampras, who captured his 52nd ca
reer ATP Tour title, went unbeaten in 
eight finals this year. He alsoo won at 
the Australian Open, Wimbledon, 
Sybase Open, Advanta Championships, 
ATP Championship, Grand Slam Cup 
and the Paris Open. He finished as the 
number one player in the world for the 
fifth straight season, tying Jimmy 
Connors, who finished in the top spot 
from 1974-78.

cross country, it really is, said Powers. 
Elizabeth Currid commented that their

 head coach Dario Donatelli
biggest obstacle was the college of NJ. 
The second obstacle was the weather. 
The cold temperatures really changed 
our warm-ups, she said.
As for the third place finish, coming on
the heels of an undefeated season, Currid 
had this to say: We went there, we ran a 
race, and were going to nationals.
The Franklin Parke Course atBrandeis
----------------------- in Boston is a course
that allows runners 
to have much faster 
times. Its a great 
course, said Currid. 
We ran it for UAAs
   .............. earlier, and the
weather was bad, 
but in good weather its a really fast 
course and theres a higher level of excite
ment about fast courses.
Last year CMU placed fourth, missing 
going to Nationals by one place. Four
teams from regionals made it to Nation*, 
als this time, compared to three that 
went last season. If everyone has their 
best race on Saturday, then were in' 
great shape, said Lott. The team has 
two big pluses going into Nationals.
First is that weve already run the 
course this season, said Donatelli. Sec
ond is the fact that we have experience.
Weve been getting better all season 
 this is our time to peak, said 
McGranghan. If we can pull things to
gether, we have a chance at beating the 
teams that beat us, said Donatelli. ;

of the strategies about where to go. 
Even though the mens team will not 
be returning to nationals this year, they 
have been quite successful this season 
despite a number of setbacks. Oldham 
said, It was a real tough season with 
inj uries. At the beginning of the season, 
the team was plagued with illness and 
injuries junior Josh Donner was sick, 
Kriechbaum had a knee operation, 
Oldham was recuperating from a knee 
injury, and Meyer was also doing some 
rehabilitation work. It wasnt until the 
last two races that we started showing 
that we were strong, said Meyer. With 
everything that happened, we did well. 
The team is already looking ahead to 
next season. Were losing two seniors 
out of our regional team, said Oldham.
But were really deep  were deeper 
than most teams. That will be really 
helpful next year. Despite the loss of 
seniors Washington and Brian 
Ingram, who have been constant con
tributors to the _________________
teams success, 
the mens team 
should be very 
strong. Meckley 
said, We have 
the nucleus of a 
very strong team 
for next, year, 
and he also looks
for sophomore Jim Gorham, who was 
slowed this season with knee prob
lems, and sophomore Ryle Goodrich, 
who was ill, to enter into the teams top 
seven runners.
Meckley is also proud of his teams 
academic accomplishments. This parj 
ticular team has finished second in the 
nation in the Academic All-Americans, 
he said. They practice every single day
"Our region was pretty good. There 
were only two spots, so it was 
pretty hard to make it to Nationals. , 
junior Kristo Kriechbaum

They are to be commended for doing that 
and keeping high QPAs.

RMC keeps Tartans in check
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The CMU Hockey club contin
ued to struggle in their division, 
dropping another game this past 
weekend, this time to Robert 
Morris College 5-2.
The first period was the 
epitome of the even, fast-paced 
hockey that CMU is ca
pable of. The top three 
lines stormed onto the 
ice, trying to follow 
coach Fred Maddalenas 
pre-game advice to have 
every man play every 
shift his best. Senior 
captain Paul Voulgaris 
came out hitting, lead
ing the defensive unit, 
while on the offensive 
side, sophomore P.J. 
Grzywacz took the body 
and opened up the ice 
for his linemates on the 
second line, senior 
Derek Jander and jun
ior Steve Leonhardt, 
who also played physi
cal first periods.
But RMC wasnt roll
ing over for anyone.
The Tartans did not 
expect the RMC squad, 
which has never traditionally 
been a powerhouse, to come out 
fighting like they did on Satur
day night. But RMC was bol
stered this year by a strong 
freshman second line, which 
connected for four of their five 
goals on the night.
The first period ended quietly
in a 0-0 tie. Starting goaltender 
Jon Kliegman had four saves, 
while CMU outshot RMC, a pass
ing squad, 11-4. It was any 
teams game. But starting off the 
second, CMU downshifted for a 
minute, and RMC took the op
portunity to start scoring on one 
of the few power play opportuni
ties that CMU allowed them.
RMC scored again on a shot that Duncan made direct knee-tobounced wrong off Kliegmans knee contact with a RMC player 
middle body pads, into the net. who was gunning to trip him. 
The addition of sophomore Cliff Freshman Rick Ebert was 
Brangwynne on defense gave net brought up to the first line to
coverage a kick start, as 
Brangwynne showed no fear in 
smacking people out of the slot.
The addition of Cliff to the 
team has greatly improved the

CMU players gather around a Robert Morris player before being up-ended 5-2.
When we made a mistake, 
they buried it. When they made 
a mistake, the puck just 
wouldnt go in the net, said 
Coach Maddalena.
Playing four on four hockey 
minutes later in the period, af
ter simultaneous minors called 
on Voulgaris and a RMC player,
team. He adds strength and 
smarts to one of our biggest prob
lem areas, said senior alternate 
captain Scott Fitzgerald.
But CMU just couldnt con
tinue to cover the snipers that 
RMC was sending in front of the 
net. The team took another hit 
when grad student Adam
sub for him, when, on the power 
play, Fitzgerald and Ebert took 
control in front of the net. The 
CMU squad was all over in front, 
jamming in rebounds, and fi
nally Jonathan Berkowitz 
lifted the puck into the net, 
sitting down at the bottom 
left post.
The celebration was 
short-lived, however, as 
RMC answered right back, 
extending their lead to 3-1 
and ending the period.
The third period offered 
CMU many opportunities, 
with RMC tallying seven 
minors. But before the mess 
began, senior Dave Mitzel 
got the puck to Voulgaris, 
who broke through three 
defenders to get the disk 
towards the net, before 
Jander drove it home.
It was a surprise. We 
hadnt connected much that 
night, and when the oppor
tunity presented itself, I 
took it. It was a nice change 
of pace to have a little free 
said Jander. RMC had ef
fectively covered CMUs rush 
for most of the night.
Again, RMC fought right back, 
despite the increased efforts of

managed another score, before 
halftime as sophomore Mike 
Campie punched in a 4-yard run.
The game was blown open at 
the start of the second half, as 
Freshman Mike McLoughlin took 
the kickoff 84 yards for a touch
down. But it wasnt until the 
fourth quarter that the Tartans

and drove for a touch
down. But senior 
Chris Neupaver 
got the Tartans 
started with a 14- 
yard touchdown 
run in the first 
quarter.
After Bethanys 
first drive, CMU 
showed the strong de
fense that helped them 
win their fifth game in a 
row.
The defense started tight
ening up and giving up less and 
less, said senior comerback Phil 
OHara, as the game remained 
tied for much of the first half.
Our kids played great, said 
head coach Rich Lackner. It was 
a game of big plays.
The big plays did come as, late 
in the half, senior Matt Farrell 
returned a fumble 45 yards to 
score.

Fencing team holds tournament in Skibo
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
They came in groups, adorned in me
tallic silver vests and clingy white pants. 
They wore wire masks shielding their 
faces. And they were armed. No, CMU 
didnt receive extraterrestrial visitors 
this weekend. The Fencing Club just 
sponsored a tournament bringing to
gether 32 local fencers.
It went really smoothly, said Jason 
Rennie, president of the Fencing Club 
and a junior computer science major.
All four representatives of the CMU 
team advanced to the direct elimination 
tournament with 26 competitors. Rennie 
placed 9th in the tournament, following 
Dom Senger-Shenck, a freshman ECE 
major, in 8th place. Of the other two 
competitors from CMU, Pete Kamarchik, 
a sophomore ECE major, placed 17th, 
and Oren Laskin, also a sophomore ECE 
major, placed 23rd.
The competition brought fencers from 
local high schools and fencing clubs. 
Randy Bruno, a CMU alumnus and a 
member of the Three Rivers Fencing Club, 
came in first place in the competition.
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Staff The Fencing Club hosted a tournament Saturday.
Fencers in the tournament follow 
the United States Fencing Associa
tion (USFA) rating system, which 
ranks fencers from A to E. An A 
ranking is reserved for the best fenc
ers in the nation. This weekends tour
nament was for D or E level fenc
ers. Bruno advanced to a C rating by 
taking first place.
It takes a little while before you can 
compete in something like this, any
where from six months to a year, said 
Rennie, who has been fencing since 
high school. I didnt do real well in this 
tournament because I was tired. I had 
to do a lot of the organization for the 
tournament, he said.
Pete [Kamarchik] did pretty well. 
He won three out of five bouts in the 
round robin. For someone thats only 
been fencing for three months, thats 
really unusual, said Rennie. He was 
able to beat everyone that hadnt been 
fencing for a while.
Considering Ive only been to two 
practices this year, I did pretty well, 
said Senger-Shenk.
The team practices two or three times 
a week with coach Iana Dakova to get 
ready for their tournaments. 
The club is comprised of a be
ginners group and advanced

struction from Dakova. Shes 
been really instrumental in 
making CMU fencers good. 
Shes helped me out a lot, 
said Rennie.
Shes not American, so 
shes a pretty good coach. 
Americans havent fenced 
long enough to really be good, 
said Senger-Shenck.
Dakova is a long -time fencer 
who was once a member of the 
Bulgarian National Team. She 
only recently began coaching 
at CMU.
The club is hoping to get 
more students involved in the 
club to increase the number of 
CMU representatives in future 
tournaments.
In the spring, the club will 
host the Holy Grail tourna
ment, in addition to attending 
various competitions at other 
schools.
Its something that gets 
your mind off of academics and 
something different that you 
can do, said Kamarchik.
Women advance to nationals
By MARSHALL WARFIELD
Tartan Dossier Literary Editor
Cold Temperatures and a crowded 
Dickinson Course pushed the Womens 
Cross Country team into third place on 
Saturday at their regional meet. This 
race decided whether the undefeated 
team would proceed to Nationals, and 
the third place finish surprised the 
undefeated team.
The disappointment that the team 
felt was not in the fact that we placed 
third, but the fact that we knew we 
werent doing 100 percent, junior 
Maureen McGranaghan said.
McGranaghan won the -----------
race in 18:45 and was fol
lowed by Margaret Powers 
(seventh 19:07), senior Mel
issa Lott (11th 19:18), jun
ior Andrea Byrnes (26th 
20:04), and sophomore Mel
issa Sloan (36th 20:24). 
But the team failed to overtake their 
biggest challenge; the College of New 
Jersey, a team they had beat on the 
difficult Dickinson course earlier this 
semester. The College of New Jersey 
took first place at regionals with 65 
points. Mehrabian College came in one
point ahead of CMU with 81. said Powers.
What was more frustrating than los- Later that same evening the team 
ing to College of New Jersey was losing was anxious to see when they started, 
to Mehrabian by only one point, said We were rolled our eyes when Coach
Lott. Lott finished directly behind a 
Mehrabian runner.
There is only one race in the regional 
cross country meet. It is a 5K race and 
runners are expected to be aggressive 
on the sometimes, narrow and difficult 
trails. Each team is allowed to enter 
seven runners. On Saturday 267 run
ners competed in the womens meet, 
and getting to the front of the pack was 
very difficult.
Excitement and tension ran high

the evening before the match, at their

Dario [Donateli] announced the start
ing position, said Powers. CMU was 
positioned to the left of where they 
wanted to be and had to cram to get in 
position. Dickinsons course starts out 
with a wide field that slowly narrows 
down. When we were waiting for the 
gun, I was thinking about our starting 
position and how we had to get over, 
said Powers.
Katie James, the only freshman on the 
team, commented that she was nervous, 
but concentrated on easing 
into it. The course was 
pretty slippery, but we 
were ready for that, just 
getting out [at the start] 
was what was important, 
said James. I also knew 
that we had some good 
practices before hand and everyone was

Professors roll out the red carpet
International students 
plan personal breaks
By NEEMA AVASHIA
Tartan Staffwriter
With Thanksgiving break right 
around the comer, most CMU stu
dents can hardly wait to get away from 
school and to their vacation destina
tions. For many, Thanksgiving break 
means home-cooked meals, free laun
dry (sometimes done for you), family, 
old friends, and no classes. However, 
for part of the student body of CMU, 
home is too far away for a four-day 
break. These international students 
have to decide where they are going to 
go, and what they are going to do over 
Thanksgiving break.
International students make up close 
to 9 percent of CMUs undergraduate 
population, 30 percent of all masters
students, and 51 percent of the doc
toral candidates. So what vacation op
tions do these students, whose homes 
are often thousands of miles away, 
have to choose from?
For some, the most logical, although 
probably least exciting, option is to 
stay on campus during the break. 
However, this idea does not appeal to 
some students.
The campus is pretty dead, said 
Nam Jae Yoon, a junior IDS major and 
president of the International Student 
Union, whose family is in Korea. Its 
pretty dead right now, [so] just imag
ine what its like during break.

Students who cannot make it home 
for the Thanksgiving holidays may not 
have to spend their breaks cooped up in 
their dorm rooms alone, if professors 
like Hugh Young and Kenya Dworkin 
have anything to do with it. Young and 
Dworkin, professors in physics and 
Spanish respectively, have made din
ner with their students part of their 
Thanksgiving traditions. Young and his 
wife have been dining with students 
since they were married in 1960, while 
Dworkins tradition began in her very 
first year at CMU in 1993. Before that, 
she had invited lonely graduate stu
dents for dinner, when she herself was 
doing her grad work.
For her dinners, which start late in 
the evening to keep with Hispanic tra
dition, Dworkin cooks Cuban and Span
ish food, and her students also bring 
other food from their own personal 
experiences. They talk, listen to mu
sic, and dance often until late at night. 
Then she and her 
kids provide shuttle 
service back to cam
pus for people who 
need rides. Dworkin 
holds other dinners 
throughout the year, 
often with a historical 
context. For example, she holds 
a Sephardic seder, taken from the tra
dition of the Jews expelled from Spain 
in 1492.
This is a great way for students to see 
history and living culture in action and 
to learn from it, Dworkin said.
Young, on the other hand, serves the 
traditional American fare, all home
made, for the approximately 35 students 
that come into his home.
Guests arent expected to bring any
thing but their appetites, said Young. 
Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and 
all the side dishes are on the table at the 
Young household, after he andhis guests 
talk and nibble on hors doeuvres in the 
living room. After dinner, some students 
stick around to play boardgames and 
socialize with their professor.
There have been times when 11 oclock 
arrived and my wife and I were ex
hausted, and we simply told people, Stay 
as long as you like, and turn out the
lights when you leave, and went to bed, 
said Young.
Dinner does not always run as 
smoothly as planned, however. Young 
relates a story from 1963, when his first 
daughter was three weeks old. Young 
did most of the cooking that year while 
his wife tended to the uncharacteristi
cally fussy baby.
In my panic to get the turkey out of 
the oven, I tilted the pan a little too 
much, and the turkey slid out of the pan 
and onto the floor, saturating my pant 
leg as it did so, said Young. I quietly 
picked up the turkey and replaced it in 
the pan, then ran to change my pants.
Both Young and Dworkin say that the 
students are both pleased 
and slightly shocked by 
the invitation.
I think its very im
portant for students to 
know that we on the 
faculty are con
cerned about
Sometimes I feel that I get more out of 
these dinners than my students, al
though that is not why I do it. I think, in 
part, I invite people over because I have 
almost no family. So you have to create 
family, said Dworkin.
According to Young and Dworkin, some 
students are comfortable in their homes 
right away, and other times there is an 
initial period of awkwardness until the 
ice is broken. Both Young and Dworkin 
said that having students into their 
homes brings them closer with students.
I might learn things about them 
through dinner conversation that 
I might not otherwise know, said 
Young. He feels it is important to
their welfare, 
said Young. We want 
them to succeed both academi
cally and in terms of their personal 
lives. The university climate can get 
pretty impersonal; were all involved 
deeply in doing our own thing, and espe
cially the new students can easily get 
the idea that nobody gives a damn about 
them. Events such as Thanksgiving din
ner dispel that notion.
It may seem to be a little unusual 
that professors spend Thanksgiving 
with their students. According to 
Dworkin, however, other professors in 
the department of Modern Languages 
also invite their students over for 
Thanksgiving activities.
I love to share experiences, my good 
fortune, and especially my culture.
get to 
know stu
dents on a per
sonal level, so that 
they realize their profes
sors have lives outside of school. 
Both Young and Dworkin say that 
having students in their homes for 
Thanksgiving dinner is a gratify
ing experience.
When it comes to my students, I think
I might spend more time with them than 
with my own kids. So they really are an 
extension of my family, if they want to 
be, says Dworkin.
Alternative vacations offer opportunity to help community

By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Do you find yourself so bored 
over semester breaks, you just 
dont know what to do with 
yourself? If the answer is yes, 
you should check out Student 
Lifes alternatives.These programs 
offer an alternative to going home or 
staying on campus, and provide an 
opportunity to participate in commu
nity service activities.
The programs are organized by 
Jocelyn Whipkey, a senior biology 
and psychology double major and 
the Student Life intern in service 
learning. Whipkey does her best 
to make sure the programs are 
accessible and appealing for all 
CMU students.
This is something that is unique at 
CMU. There are very little opportuni
ties for students to serve the commu
nity at CMU or to do something other 
than academic work. This is their 
chance. Students can benefit in somany 
ways, Whipkey said.
Whipkey feels the alternative pro
grams are great in that participants 
can meet a number of other stu
dents. It is also ideal for people 
who do not have a great deal of 
community service experience. In 
addition, she said, the trips are 
inexpensive and fun.
During the fall midsemester break, 
Whipkey led 10 students to a shelter 
building in Clarksburg, West Virginia. 
Participants stayed for two nights and 
one day. They worked intensely on 
transforming apartment rooms into 
renovated classrooms. However, there 
was more to their trip than ripping 
down walls and putting up new ones.
We were able to eat with the people 
who stayed in the shelter and people 
from the town. They had fun, and so did
we. It was very cool. It sounds like it 
wouldnt be exciting, but it was such a 
wonderful experience, Whipkey said.
In addition to planning service activi
ties for midsemester breaks, she also 
offers programs during Thanksgiving 
break and spring break. However, this 
year, due to lack of student response, 
Whipkey was forced to cancel the 
Thanksgiving break program.
Whipkey is excited about the newly 
installed summer break programs in 
which students will be traveling to
Dresden, Germany for 2-1/2 weeks. 
Though this trip exceeds the usual 
$10-dollar-per-person fee for the other 
programs by five to six hundred dol
lars, interest amongst students is 
strong. In fact, Whipkey has received 
so many completed applications that 
she will have to interview prospective 
participants in the Europe program to 
get the number down to 12.
Though the spring break program has 
not been planned yet, Whipkey knows
that students will be heading down 
south for an entire week.
I want to make use of the extra time 
and meet the needs of students as well. 
Its a longer trip, and I want it to be at a 
warm location, she said.
Whipkey publicizes the programs 
through flyers and signs as well as ser
vice newsletters. She also contacts RAs 
and sends out information over email. 
Students can also be selected to partici
pate in the programs by receiving nomi
nations through their departments.
We were able to eat with the people who

College Briefs
Playwright assumes artistic responsibility at CMU
The Runner Stumbles was the winner 
of the Best Broadway Play of 1976, and 
its author, Milan Stitt, is now an in
structor of play writing in the School of 
Drama. The Tartan caught up with Stitt 
and asked him a few questions about 
wisdom, plays, and the CMU culture. 
The Tartan: What do you think of the 
CMU culture? The way that students 
and professors go about work, what 
theyre passionate about, their collec
tive campus lifestyle?
Milan Stitt: At this point, I am only 
familiar with the culture of the stu
dents in the School of Theater. As might 
be anticipated, they are highly moti
vated and work beyond what one might 
ordinarily expect of students. Of course, 
they are all artists first and students 
second, which is probably why they are 
so different from the usual students. 
What I like best about the schools cul
ture is that the theater faculty puts 
education and students first. Ive taught
at schools when all the faculty [arguing] 
was territorial and had little to do with 
education. Here the focus seems to be on 
finding expanded opportunities for the 
students both during their regular stud
ies and after they graduate.
IT: Whats your favorite play and why?
MS: This is always a difficult question, 
because one likes different works for dif
ferent reasons. Is Agamemnon more of a 
favorite because of its brilliant poetic 
structure than is The Importance of Be
ing Earnest because of its humor? Cer
tainly, the humor of Agamemnon and the 
poetry of Earnest would not make them 
favorites. Among my other favorities 
would be Romeo and Juliet, any Moliere 
translated by Richard Wilbur, and, in the 
contemporary theater, most plays by Joe 
Orton, Peter Schaffer, David Henry 
Whang, and Nicky Silver, anything with 
lyrics by Stephen Sondheim.
TT: If you had to tell a CMU student 
what your work/writing was about in one 
sentence, what would that sentence be?
MS: Id think it was rather a superfi
cial request, but I suppose I would say 
that I am always trying to entertain 
with insight and truth. I doubt there are 
many artists that would claim other
wise, although they might not like the 
word entertain.
TT: Have you found a favorite spot 
on campus?
MS: Not really. Although not far 
from campus I like the feeling of walk
ing down Walnut Street. If only there 
were several bookstores there, it 
would be perfect.
TT: What was the last movie you saw?
MS: I tend to see movies that Ive 
assigned for classes, but L.A. Confi
dential was one I saw recently. I'm 
eager to see The Ice Storm and Boogie 
Nights at the moment.
TT: What wisdom do you hope to 
impart to the CMU students and 
your colleagues?
MS: I dont know that I have any. 
Making theater, creating art is a pro
cess. I love the process, the collabora
tion, and, I suppose, Id like to share that 
love. I dont think that is probably what 
youd call wisdom.
TT: What do you consider the virtues 
of a good playwright? The virtues of a 
good play?
MS: A writer who can hear [things 
like] criticism good and bad, director 
[and] designer ideas [and so forth]. One 
who is a perfectionist and wont rest 
until every rhythm and every laugh is 
nailed down perfectly, who doesnt read 
reviews because he or she already knows 
exactly what they have and have not 
accomplished. A writer who reads and 
sees art as much as he or she writes and, 
therefore, can talk about a world bigger 
than their own dysfunctional familyTT: If you werent allowed to be a play
wright or a teacher, what would you be?
MS: A really bad director or actor, 
but something in the theater. Maybe 
a house manager would be kinder to 
the audiences.
Heritageanchors artist s provocative work
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Eyelashes, finger nails, and soil 
from the different places she has 
lived  this is the modern ap
proach by which Cuban multime
dia artist Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons integrates African prov
erbs into her work.
Last Thursday, students were ex
posed to a unique perspective about 
art when Campos-Pons spoke in 
McConomy Auditorium about the 
meaning of her work.
One of the things weve tried to do 
in this lecture series is to provide a 
multi-cultural experience by intro
ducing artists from different cultures 
and ethnic groups, said Jon Beckley, 
art professor and chairman of the 
School of Arts lecture series.
Campos-Pons began by explain
ing how she developed an interest 
in the arts as she grew up in Cuba.
Spending much of her childhood 
meditating and reflecting, CamposPons began to learn and dream 
about art. This passion inspired her 
to pursue it as a career and to begin 
visiting museums and studying art 
history. It was during her quest to centered on themes of femininity, blackearn recognition as a serious painter ness, and Cuban history, 
that she discovered her fascination Her work was a big change from a lot

never far to the house of the one you 
love and Death of the heart is some
thing that can not be shared.
I thought her work was very beau
tiful. I enjoyed seeing a distinctly 
feminine approach to camera work 
and editing, said Hyla Willis, a gradu
ate student in the Art Department.
Although the lecture was already 
running late by the time the films 
were over, a short question and an
swer session was held before the event 
concluded. One of the most interest
ing questions regarded the origin of 
the films soundtrack. Campos-Pons 
explained that her husband, who is 
also an artist, was responsible for 
writing the music that was featured 
throughout the piece.
Campos-Pons hoped that her lec
ture exposed students to a body of 
work that was different from what 
most students have previously expe
rienced. I wanted to get across the 
possibility of letting who you are come 
through in your work with honesty, 
simplicity, and clarity, she said. Cur
rently, she has been teaching at the 
School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 
Boston and plans to install a solo 
exhibition next year at the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York City.
This lecture was the sixth installment 
of the School of Arts seven-part Fall 1997 
Lecture Series. This Thursday, Mark 
Dion, a project-based artist from New 
York City, will present the final lecture in 
McConomy Auditorium at 5 pm. These 
lectures are free and open to the public.
We hope the rest of the university 
takes advantage of the lecture series and 
exposes themselves to the fine arts in a 
university environment that promotes 
integration of disciplines, said Beckley.

Campos-Pons works with nontraditional media, including eyelashes and fingernails.
I thought she used striking meta
phors to represent the importance of her 
ethnicity, said Sara Amodio, a fresh
man art major.
Campos-Pons also presented two vid
eos that dealt with issues pertaining to 
her identity as a black Cuban woman. 
The videos incorporated such compo
nents as a sacred hand-washing ritual, 
the union of black and white lovers, and 
a traditional dance. Throughout the sec

visit friends and relatives in cit

while others will take the oppor

and do a little sightseeing.

Since international students who 
currently stay on campus for 
breaks dont really have any spe

ternational Student Union is in 
the process of planning programs 
for future Thanksgivings.
In the meantime, there are ac

a sophomore CS and IM double

she got to try all kinds of African

looking forward to spending a 
relaxing Thanksgiving break on 
campus. Im going to stay here, 
sleep, eat, go shopping, and study 
for finals, said Ply Daosukho, a 
first-year CIT student originally 
from Thailand, of her plans for 
the break.
So, while some students are 
packing their bags to go home 
next weekend, others will be think
ing about sights to see in Boston, 
New York, or Chicago. All the 
while, another small group will be 
pondering what theyre going to 
do on campus for four days when 
no one else is here.

Some international students remain on campus during breaks, travel 
to cities they are eager to explore, or visit relatives.

Computer security mirrors life
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
The real estate agent, a well-upholstered 
woman about our parents age, looked a 
bit surprised at the five of us standing 
there.... Id love to have seen her reaction 
to my sisters tongue piercing.
cess-me like throwing money into a 
black hole. And usually its too much 
money. So we made a decision that 
made me feel more like a Real GrownUp than ever.
Were buying a house. How adult. 
How American. We will actually own 
real estate.
So we started looking around, 
grudgingly willing to rent, but hop
ing to buy. After some searching, we 
found a listing for a place that was 
actually big enough for the six of us, 
and in a good neighborhood. This is a 
relatively unusual combination. It 
was pricey to buy, but possibly man
ageable to rent. So we made an ap
pointment to go look at it.
The real estate agent, a well-uphol
stered woman about our parents age, 
looked a bit surprised at the five of us 
standing there in jeans and boots and 
flannel, like we were just totally out
side the' realm of her experience. Id 
love to have seen her reaction to my 
sisters tongue piercing.
Lets just say she made it rela
tively clear that we werent quite 
what she had been expecting. She 
showed us the house pretty 
unenthusiastically, telling us that 
some medical students had lived here 
before, some nice kids, REALLY 
QUIET (pointed glance). She re
minded us, twice, that if we did de
cide to buy, wed be responsible for 
the lawn, the appliances, and any
thing that went wrong with the 
house. Such a large responsibility.
fire to kitchen appliances or throw 
furniture through plate glass win
dows. Hmph. Ten bucks says we looked 
pretty much like her kids, who were 
clearly just not prepared for such a big 
responsibility. It was a weird feeling 
to be doing this very grown-up thing, 
but still getting treated like a bunch 
of delinquent 15-year-olds.
Things got better after that. We 
managed to find a realtor who be
haved like a human being toward us
 giving us advice, but not patron
izing us. Weve spent a lot of time 
tromping through houses on Sun
day mornings, checking for water 
stains, cracks in weight-bearing 
walls, how well windows seal. Weve 
done our homework, we know what 
to look for, and now we may even 
have found a place.
But its hard to forget that first 
experience, and how discouraging it 
was. Just a reminder that the ma
chinery of the world is often struc
tured such that peoples assumptions 
about you, based on the color of your 
skin, how many holes youve had 
punched in you, and the cost of your 
haircut and shoes, are often more 
important to them than who you actu
ally are, and that it takes work and 
luck to get past that.
Carrie is a senior in psychology. 
She is fully prepared to accept the 
responsibilities of homeownership: 
repairs, upkeep, and the occasional 
game of scrabble.
trWe live with an amount of 
insecurity in the real world,
[and] its good enough, said 
Microsofts Butler Lampson, 
setting up his talk Computer 
Security in the Real World.
Lampson stated that people 
had come to expect perfect se
curity from computers, but that 
this is an unrealistic goal. Ac
cording to him, people should 
be content to have the same 
level of security in the com
puter world as in the real world.
The best way to do this, accord
ing to Lampson, is to be able to 
hold all users accountable for 
their actions.
Lampson spoke to a packed 
house of about 250 people last 
Thursday afternoon as part 
of the School of Computer Sci
ence Distinguished Lecture 
Series. He outlined his talk 
by mentioning the tools 
people use in creating com
puter security: authentica
tion, or whos allowed to use 
a system; authorization, or 
what they are trusted to do in 
that system; and auditing, or 
a record of what they do. 
Lampson described these 
tools as the gold standard.
Of course Im going to use 
the gold standard because 
[the three tools] all begin with 
Au, Lampson said. How sys
tem designers assure these se
curity benchmarks tends to 
vary. More often than not, 
people build security features, 
instead of perfect security. 
Absolutely secure systems are 
scarce in the computer world for two 
primary reasons  the complicated 
nature of systems, and the fact that 
people wont buy them.
According to Lampson, the key to rea
sonable security is in auditing because 
auditing allows for accountability. You 
shouldnt rely on the locks being right. 
Its more important to see whats being 
done, he said.
Just like life outside of computers, 
its not absolutely necessary to pre
vent criminals from committing crimes 
as long as you can track their actions 
and prosecute them. According to 
Lampson, prosecution can be just as 
good a deterrent, and less expensive 
than complete security.
The second half of Lampsons talk dealt 
with technical details about how au
thentication, authorization, and espe
cially auditing can be implemented in 
distributed systems. He made constant 
real-life analogies to the computer world, 
including a time when a colleague of his 
visited the National Security Agency 
with a briefcase. His friend was searched 
for storage devices at the front desk and, 
after walking a short distance past the 
desk, suddenly remembered he had a 
laptop in his briefcase. Realizing his 
mistake, he walked back and told the 
guard. The guard confiscated the brief
case and informed Lampsons friend that
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
The Gold Standard is how Lampson referred to creating computer security systems.
he would get it back in three weeks.
According to Lampson, when the laptop 
came back, it had a new harddrive.
If you live in New York, you have
two or three locks and bars on your 
windows downstairs, Lampson said. 
If you live in Boise, you probably 
dont even lock your door.... Each [per
son] is acting in response to an ob
served threat.
After the talk, Lampson held a quesJim Morris, head of the Computer 
Science department, said he thought 
Lampsons ideas were sensible. How
ever, members of the audience were 
not as completely sold on the idea of 
auditing since in such a system, ano
nymity is lost.
I think anonymity is a big issue, 
said Robert Watson, a junior logic and 
computation major. Theres a lot of 
issues where you dont need an idenIf you live in New York, you have two or

tion and answer session. During the 
session, audience members seemed ea
ger to liken computer hacks to atomic 
bombs. Lampson refuted the idea that 
a crash of a computer system, no mat
ter how large, would be anything like 
an atomic bomb.
You get a situation where everybody 
is denied service for six hours. Its a lot 
different from a whole city being blown 
up, said Lampson.

information on AIDS research, you had

You dont need to have an identity to 
buy certain controlled substances, said 
Sam Weiler, a systems programmer for 
Computing Services. For instance, to buy 
alcohol, a store clerk doesnt necessarily 
care who you are, just if youre over 21 or 
not. Hes making a value judgment. 
Thats a very hard line to draw.

Bordering Normalcy
by Carrie Jones-McGuire
I hate fall. Oh, I like it for about half 
an hour when the leaves are changing, 
but as soon as the temperature drops 
below 50 degrees, Im pacing like 
Rilkes panther. I get as restless and 
irritable as Jesse Helms at a 
Greenpeace rally. Around about Octo
ber, I get this urge to pick everything 
up and start over. This year, my urges 
and I actually have somewhere to go. 
My housemates and I are looking for a 
new place. All of us hate the idea of 
renting, which feels to suburban-prin(Yes, thank you; we did get into 
CMU  we arent chimps.) When 
she found out how many cats we 
have (five, an embarrassingly large 
number), she seized on it like a Rot
tweiler on a Milk Bone. Oh, my, 
she said. The owners might not like 
that. Theyd had a bad experience 
with a dog, see, and even the best 
pets.... Well, you never know. Thanks 
very much for our time.
Once in the car, I fumed a little, 
thinking, Lady, who do we look like, 
Marilyn Manson (whos just another 
nice boy from the suburbs, I might 
add)? We were a little scruffy, but 
decent enough, no visible scars or 
needle tracks. Were grad students 
and older undergrads, all of us with 
major work to do and not all that 
much social time. Hell, a big night for 
us is two Blockbuster movies and a 
bottle of red wine. Were geeks, lady. 
We argue about the nature of 
hypertext and whether science is a 
hegemonic discourse. We do not set

appy peppy people, you think to yourself. But 
its the coffee I tell ya, the coffee. Cause there 
isnt anybody who can be that chipper in real life, you 
know? Its just not possible. And thats probably a good 
thing, because if somebody could keep up that kind of 
energy for too long their brain would explode, and you 
know whos gonna hafta clean that up? Yeah. Me.

Java Jive
What about joe? Masters of brewing reveal secrets
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In the seventies, it was bars. In the 
eighties, diners. In the nineties, it would 
seem that coffee shops have become the 
official hip place to hang out. Coffee 
shops are the meeting places for the
characters of popular sitcoms, the topic 
of numerous articles and television news
magazine stories, and common back
drops for music videos. For avid coffee
But not all CMU students seem to be 
up on the Pittsburgh coffee shop scene. 
I havent gone to any [coffeeshops.] I 
just cant find a good one, said sophodrinkers, a certain mystique surrounds more Haw Kor, an industrial managethe pursuit of the elusive perfect cup  ment major. Can it be assumed, then, 
whats the secret behind great brewing, that CMU students simply have no inat home or at a coffeeshop? terestinjoiningtherestofthe country in
its coffeehouse-loving obsession?
Well, not exactly. 
Certainly, some 
students are just 
not interested in 
the trend. Senior 
Audry Mcafee, an 
economics major, 
said she doesnt like 
coffee shops. There 
is too much smok
ing, and isnt it ex
pensive? she said. 
But on the whole, 
most students said 
that they would be 
interested in going 
to a coffee shop, and 
that they often go 
while at home. Ap
parently then, the 
Pittsburgh area is 
simply lacking in 
what CMU stuDrianamixn/idiiaiirnuiuotan ividiidgei dents consider
Customers in Kiva Han, on South Craig Street in Oakland, hung out on Saturday afternoon. good coffee
houses. So then the question becomes, 
what makes a good coffeehouse? The 
atmosphere of a shop can enhance the 
experience of drinking coffee. One 
word, stuff, defines this atmosphere.
Freshman Eric Spaulding said that 
coffeehouses are good if they have a 
literary aspect to them, such as poetry 
readings or small libraries for custom
ers use. Shops draw people in with a 
gimmick, something to attract atten
tion. This literary component, or the age 
and attitude of the clientele, are factors 
that can make or break a shops appeal.
To true coffee lovers, the real appeal 
of these shops comes in finding the 
ultimate drink. But even if the public 
scene puts you off, there are tricks to 
brewing your own stellar pot of coffee. 
Listening to the experts can provide 
knowledge to ensure that you can find 
great coffee, either in your own home or 
in a shop or restaurant.
Bill S woope, of the half-decade-old Cof
fee Tree Roasters, pinpoints the most 
important factor for brewing as fresh
ness. To find fresh coffee beans or 
grounds, first finding a reputable estab
lishment that sells coffee is important. 
Swoope, whose family-owned business 
is not only a roasting company but also 
a chain of coffeeshops, dates every pack
age of beans, so everything is sold within 
about a week. He said that beans have a 
shelf life of three to four weeks, and once
theyre ground, the freshness lasts for 
less than a week.
When brewing your own coffee, Swoope 
said that clean water, like spring o!r 
filtered water, is also a factor. Minerals 
from the water help soften coffee flavor, 
and that will stay in your cup, he said. 
In addition, using a gold filter rather 
than paper will allow more of the natu
ral oils from the beans to flow into each 
pot you brew.
But when buying coffee from a shop or 
restaurant, there are traits to look for to 
tell whether or not the coffee has been 
brewed correctly. According to Swoope, 
they are acidity, which is crispness and 
bite to the tongue; body, the thickness 
and texture of the liquid; and flavor, the 
taste of the coffee. One quality, termed 
grassy by the coffee industry, which 
means that the taste of the actual plant 
is detectable in the coffee, is one indica
tor of a poor cup of coffee, Swoope said.
Coffeeshops have different reasons for 
being. Some are more about being a styl
ish hangout  the stuff. Others are 
focused on the brewing of good coffee. But 
neither of these reasons detract from the 
appeal of the recent coffee drinking trencj, 
which is not decreasing in popularity. If 
youre into brewing it yourself, or enjoy
ing the atmosphere of having someone 
else brew it for you, the knowledge of how 
to find a good cup of joe will no doubt 
improve the experience.
Writer people-watches over lattes
Confused? Okay, lets go back to the basics. Steamed milk and espresso shots 
in varying amounts make up the bulk of coffee concoctions. In increasing order 
of milk content, heres the most important java jive: espresso, macchiato, 
cappuccino, and latte. All other words are adjectives differentiating the drinks. 
Its pretty intuitive, not so hard to learn, and important to know if youre going to be 
hip and happening in the 90s.

Maybe its because Im a bit 
high-strung already, but the prac
tice of drinking coffee still eludes 
me. But somehow, without me 
following the trend, this practice 
has become highly ritualized, 
with late-night shops cropping 
up practically everywhere, and 
people flocking for caffeine and 
steamed milk rather than 
whatevers on tap at the local bar.
In an attempt to demystify the 
flourishing coffee shop scene, I 
sat in Electra, on West Penn in 
the Strip District, with two 
friends and watched  watched 
who was in, who was out, what 
they did, and which hot bever
ages they sipped.
10:55 pmAs I push open the 
door, two women sit at an an
tique table covered with a gold 
tablecloth. Their oversized cof
fee cups are empty, and their 
ashtrays full. Like every other 
group of people in the shops 
space, they appear engrossed in 
nonchalant conversation.
The shops space lends itself to 
long talks, as if I am at home with 
my friends rather than in a pub
lic place. The ceiling is low, with 
dim lights. A coffee bar sits tucked 
in the corner, and the cappuccino 
machine whirrs in the back
ground. A wrinkled couch sits 
clustered around a fireplace, and 
my two companions and I are 
immediately drawn to it. We put 
our feet on the 50s style table, 
and stare at the flame. We gos
sip. Whats the ideal man? some
body asks.
11:16 pm  I set my single 
cappuccino on the table. Oh yeah, 
coffee. Thats why were here. The 
two women behind us are still 
talking, and the stereo softly plays 
Ella Fitzgerald. My friend sips 
her cherry cordial hot chocolate 
with cinnamon, three bucks a pop. 
My cappuccino is overflowing 
with steamed milk. Just the way 
I like it.
Against the door, a cigarette 
machine and a computerized slot 
machine stand unused. This place 
feels like part restaurant, part 
bar, part family room.
11:35  It occurs to me that 
amidst a sea of bars, clubs, and 
closed shops, Electra is a respite. 
Nowhere else can we get close
enough to talk about everything 
from Italian bread recipes to 
trauma over English classes. 
Whatsyour favorite thingto eat?
11:45 pm  Two people walk 
in off the street, wearing no 
coats, even though you can see 
your breath outside. The man is 
staggering; Im assuming they 
must have come from a bar, 
maybe Rolands next door. Most 
of the people in this place are 
younger than this couple, who 
lean close together, talking, then 
kiss. My friend and I look at 
each other enviously. We talk, 
just briefly, reminding me of a 
ski lodge. They have come from 
a late night restaurant.
There arent any other couples 
in here, only groups. One big

Coffee used to be simple, black or with milk and sugar. But that time is long 
gone. Todays coffee bar culture has created loads of latte lingo that can be hard 
to understand. Try using one of these trendy phrases the next time youre in the

LIOThe Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  17 November 1997Local exhibit provokes questions
By SUSAN MURRAY
Junior Staffwriter
Despite the political claim that the 
exhibit Artists of a Different Caliber in 
the Hewlett Gallery is a statement of 
anti-gun metal sculpture, many of the 
66 participating artists managed to cre
ate works that have the power to fill the 
imagination, not just the political bill.
The framers of the exhibition required 
that every work of art contain actual 
gun parts. Many of the guns in the exhi
bition were obtained through buy-back 
programs and other types of anti-gun 
programs.
In some of the works, the gun was in 
fall view, in others hidden, in others 
transformed. Babys First Handgun, a 
multimedia sculpture by Andrew Phares, 
appeared to be a plain wooden duck with 
wheels for a child to pull, a childs toy. 
The materials list on the title card re
vealed a .22 caliber handgun embedded 
in the ducks body. Despite the rather 
obvious, if melodramatic, symbolism of
fered by the duck, it still was an appeal
ing and terrifying object that brought
into question the nature of a society that 
can manufacture a simple toy as well as 
deadly weapons.
The bad symbolism trap was one that 
many of the artists fell into, that a gun is 
(pardon the expression) a loaded sym
bol. Guns instantly conjure certain sto
ries simply through their presence. The 
best works were those that sought to 
show a new way of thinking about a gun: 
as pieces of jewelry, or as a toy, or as an 
object of simple, abject beauty.
Many of the works personified guns. 
Robert Coogans steel and enamel Bed 
of Tears consisted of a gun tucked 
neatly under the sheets of a small bed, 
the nose resting quietly on the pillow. 
The line between victim and killer was 
effectively blurred by the strangely hu
manizing imagery.
Each time I have returned to the 
Hewlett Gallery, Ive noticed something 
new, or found a new way of looking at 
something old, and I experienced a simi
lar process at this show. The show exists 
at many levels, from the literal, anti
gun pieces, such as Eric Margr/s Sur
geon Generals Warning, to baffling
works like Bill^.Reids Perfectly Safe 
Bird Feeder.
Surgeon Generals Warning was one 
of the more obsequious pieces. It was a 
small, red fire-alarm-style box with a 
glass window. Inside was a gun and we 
were offered a little hammer with the 
instructions In case of emergency: Do 
not break glass printed on the handle. 
The piece was a representation of the 
contradiction inherent in a society that 
sells guns, but expects the guns not to be 
used. In that sense, the piece was ulti
mately weak. It relied on words, rather 
than the power that sculpture has to 
evoke emotion visually, to send its mes
sage. It came to the viewer begging to be 
analyzed. The message was more impor
tant than the expression of the message, 
and thus the artist became a politician.
Artists of a Different Caliber is a 
thought-provoking show. Some of the 
strongest works attempted to conjure a 
world for the viewers that encouraged 
them to question the nature of violence.

By ELIZABETH CURRID
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Change may be good, but no one 
wants things unrecognizable, said 
Mutsumi, a character in Scotch n Sodas 
production of The Last Dancer. This s 
entiment is expressed by Mutsumi as a 
reaction to the source of cultural change 
in 1965 Japan.
The play, written by junior BHA ma
jor Maureen McGranaghan and di
rected by Amy Poettinger, is the story 
of Hiroshima bomb survivors who live 
in an orphanage on an island off the 
.coast. The conflict centers on their re
dactions to Western culture changes in
stilled in them by Akiko, a young col
lege student from Tokyo who comes as 
a temporary supervisor of the orphan
age. Akiko, played by junior BHA ma
jor Liz McDonald, is determined to 
make radical transformations to the 
primitive island.
From substituting cutlery for chop
sticks to introducing baseball gloves, 
Akiko not only causes upheaval and
resentment but also manages to fall in 
love with one of the inhabitants, 
Mutsumi, who is at the same time in 
conflict with Akiko.
The play unfolds into a gripping tale of 
both resistance and succumbing to the 
influences of Akiko. McGranaghan deli
cately and deliberately deals with each 
of Akikos changes while cleverly con
veying the transitions and emotional 
impact on every character. The play 
thoroughly reveals McGranaghans forte 
as a young playwright.
The Last Dancer portrays an array of 
charming, humorous, and strong char
acters. Sophomore English major Cris 
Peterson played her part of the highstrung cook, Ota, impeccably, illuminat
ing the stage with her outlandish and 
comical persona. Sophomore Tim Fife 
portrays Sensei, the wise, almost omni
scient narrator.
While Akiko was powerful, energetic, 
and amusing in her own right and 
Mutsumi, played by freshman Kieran 
Smiley, passionate and impacting dur
ing his monologues, the dynamic between
the two as lovers was hard to conceive. As 
a love story, Akiko and Mutsumi did not 
fully develop a realistic chemistry. As 
Eichi, Tom Chang conveyed a young up
beat inhabitant of the island.
Of all the characters, I was most en
ticed with Shima, Mutsumis younger 
sister who only appears in flashbacks. 
Mirika Nakayama portrays Shima and 
creates the most adorable and endear
ing of all the characters. Though she was 
not on stage as often as most of the 
characters, I left the play most impressed 
by her acting ability.
The only complaint I have is the lack 
of support and people attending the 
performance. Surprisingly, the audi
ence consisted of only a handful of 
people. I highly enjoyed attending a 
performance of Scotch n Sodas The 
Last Dancer.
The writing, setting, and acting fuse 
together to create a beautiful story of 
change and growth intermingled with 
the undertones of a love story. As 
amateur productions go, this is one of 
the best.
Concert showcases indie music gamut
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
WRCT has never been known as the 
most mainstream of radio stations, 
instead preferring to spotlight less 
commercial and often more innova
tive acts. So it should come as no 
surprise that WRCT spon
sored a concert held Tues
day in McConomy audito
rium, featuring Meisha,
The Apples (in Stereo), The 
Silver Apples, and The 
Notwist. The venue made 
the show' seem more like an 
exhibition rather than a 
concert, with each act ped
dling its wares and making 
room for the next band. The 
focus of the show was to 
present several facets of 
todays indie rock scene, 
from bizarre synth-pop to 
570s-influenced arena rock.
However, The Notwist, a 
German band, left quite an 
impact on those who stuck around for 
their midnight set.
Meisha opened the show with a 20- 
minute act consisting of one song, El 
Chihuahua. The band consisted of a 
bass, a guitar, and a keyboard or addi
tional guitar. A local band billing its 
sound as instrumental drone rock, 
Meisha created a wall of lofty sounds, 
using sharply geometric patterns to 
create an eerie sound. While the bands 
layered sound and repetitive patterns 
were able to create something of a 
hypnotic effect, the music ultimately 
lacked anything to engage the lis
tener for any length of time.
After what seemed like an hour of 
settingup, The Apples (in Stereo) took 
the stage. For the most part, they 
were an unremarkable guitar-bassdrums group ripping through retrosounding rock tunes driven by huge 
riffs. The band was commendable, 
though, for the drive and effort they 
put into their music. Unlike Meisha, 
who seemed detached from the audi
ence, the members of The Apples (in
Stereo) worked hard to entertain the 
crowd, especially the drummer, whose 
vigorous pounding ensured that none 
of the songs ever became dull.
I have to admit that I was a little 
taken aback at the sight of the next 
band, The Silver Apples. Changing 
effortlessly from Indian sounds to dark,
Brian Smlth/Tartan Photo Staff Manager The Apples (in Stereo) performed last Tuesday.
subterranean grooves and moments of 
pure pop, The Silver Apples proved to 
be quite innovative. The music was at 
its best when it was concise, but too 
often the sounds became abstract and 
difficult to appreciate.
The final act of the evening, The 
Notwist, provided a jariingblast of noise 
rock that was by far the highlight of the 
evening. The quartet established an omi
nous and disorganized sound that blew 
away most of what passes for alt-rock 
these days. The Notwist ripped through 
tracks from their new album, 12, drift
ing from riff-based rockers to jumbled 
messes of sound. Towards the end, the 
band played The String, and like the 
album version, the song finished with a 
powerful, thoughtful climax.
WRCT was certainly on to some
thing by packaging different forms of 
cutting-edge music together, but 
theres really no point in keeping a 
potential audience in the dark. Maybe 
next time things will be a little better 
organized  and maybe theyll even 
bring The Notwist back.
Show depicts burghs history
By SUSAN MURRAY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
If you dont love Pittsburgh 
now, you will love it after seeing 
the newest show at the Carnegie. 
From November 8 until January
25, the Carnegie __________
Museum of Art 
presents Pitts
burgh Revealed,
(a collection of photographs that 
documents the 
history of Pitts
burgh from 1850 5 
to the present.
The exhibit is arranged in 
chronological order, from hazy 
pale brown images of river 
barges and bridges through the 
age of industry to the stark aban
doned factories of present day.
Most of the older images were 
taken for surveying purposes, or 
as family portraits. In this ex
hibit, the subject of these histori
cal prints evokes a sense of nos
talgia, which is what makes the 
work valuable.
Some of the images predat
ing 1900, especially those of 
people, forced me to stop and 
look more closely. People dont 
change, not even after a hun
dred years. The faces of 1890 
are disturbingly familiar.
It is impossible to talk about 
Pittsburgh without mentioning 
steel. The earliest images of facto
ries are Alvin Lan Gordons silver 
gelatin prints from the 1910s. His 
photographs of mills embedded in

lightly with new snow makes the 
mills seem almost peaceful.
In contrast, W. Eugene Smiths 
images from the 50s show men in 
the midst of the shift from the 
pre-industrial to the modern era. 
In one image, the bent figure of a 
worker is dwarfed by a crucible 
filled with molten steel.
Sol Lisbsohns photos from 
the same time period take the 
viewer into the family life of the 
steel worker. A view of a 1950s 
kitchen filled with modern ap
pliances demonstrates how the 
mills changed family life. These 
images of production, of the 
making of America, are beauti
ful and terrible.

river-front housing complex. 
Likewise, the exhibits pho
tos from the 60s, 70s, and

a city searching 
for a new means 
of existence.
By the time I 
reached Charles 
Brodskys banal im
ages of modern 
^mm working class 
Pittsburghers in 
the 80s, I was beginning to 
wonder if the city had given up 
all hope since it lost the big 
steel mills.
Fortunately, the show shifts 
at this point. The images from 
the mid 80s and on are of the 
city itself. Duane Michals 
Pittsburghers is a diverse sur
vey of the modern city dweller. 
Jance Erich-Mos uses a photo 
collage technique to create 
dreamscapes from bits of the 
Pittsburgh landscape, turning 
suspension bridges into what 
seem to be DNA.
There are even a few images 
of the Oakland area in the show, 
the Cathedral of learning, 
Schenley Park, and the turret 
of Hamerschlag Hall. Seeing 
these with the other images 
reminded me that Carnegie 
Mellon is a part of Pittsburgh. 
Were tied to Pittsburghs great 
industrial history, and hope
fully some of us will be part of 
Pittsburghs future,
It is easy to feel as if the 
entire universe is the CMU 
campus. Through getting to 
know the history and impor
tance of Pittsburgh, its pos
sible to expand the horizon and 
fall in love with the Steel City.
Pittsburgh Revealed will be 
at the Carnegie Museum of Art 
until January 25.

say I am very delighted to have 
the privilege to experience this 
class of music. Maybe this enjoy
ment is due to the similarities 
between ska and reggae or just a 
reflection of the high quality al
bum by Floyd Lloyd.
Who: Floyd Lloyd 
I What: Tear It Up: The Ska 
A Album
Company: Lightyear
His second album, Tear It Up: 
The Ska Album, blends ska, 
reggae, and jazz brilliantly. A
smooth chorus is accompanied by 
a variety of instruments to sim
ply soothe the soul with the addi
tion of sound effects here and 
there to keep you an
ticipating the next 
movement in the song.
Floyd Lloyd writes 
and performs his own 
songs and features 
Ernest Ranglin as one 
of his guitarists. The 
great thing about his 
music is that lyrics are 
not overwhelming and the 
rhythm is not too complicated, so 
it becomes easy to listen to.
All of the songs were brilliant, 
in my opinion, but Toure For 
Real is the best song on the al
bum. Its rhythm is relatively com
plicated in contrast with the other 
songs, but the lyrics are strong 
and moving. Through investigation of the song, I found eight 
instruments of different families 
in perfect harmony. Lyrics are sup
posed to be in harmony with vari[The] lyrics are not over
whelming and the rhythm is 
not too complicated, so it 
becomes easy to listen to.
ous instruments which are used 
in a musical piece, but these lyrics 
seem to dominate the instrumen
tal background and very little vari
ance in notes can be found be
tween lyric performance and in
strumental performance.
You wont really understand the 
feeling you get when you listen to 
the music, but it is extremely re
laxing. The better half of the al
bum can be found towards the end 
due to some form of variance ber 
tween songs, but if youre in a 
mood to fall asleep, listen 
to the first couple of songs 
which have virtually no 
lyrics. Another negative 
aspect of the album was 
that the first halfs cho
rus lines becomes ex
tremely repetitive.
Although I seem to be 
somewhat skeptical of 
some portions of the album, it is 
only a few songs in both halves 
which are contradictory to the 
overall positive outlook of the al
bum. Its a great album for some-: 
one who is willing to listen to new 
forms of music and also to those 
ska  fanatics out there. If that 
doesnt appeal to you, its also 
easy to fall asleep to.Movie explores effects of adultery
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Sometimes things are not as idyllic as they 
seem. Such is the case in Eves Bayou, a film 
set in the Louisiana of the 60s. Legend says 
the inhabitants of Eves Bayou are descen
dants of one marriage, and accordingly, the 
people seem at ease with one another. But 
amidst the mangroves and parties, dark 
undercurrents swirl: adultery, prophesies, 
and familial tensions.
What: Eves Bayou 
Director: Kasi Lemmons 
Company: Trimark Pictures
Samuel L. Jackson stars as Louis Batiste, 
a small-town doctor. Hes often home late 
after a full day of house calls. His wife Roz 
(Lynn Whitfield) stays at home and super
vises Eve (Jumee Smollett), Cisely (Meagan 
Good), and Poe (Jake Smollett), their three 
children. Immediately we are thrust into the 
thick of things: Eve falls asleep in the car
riage house and awakens to find her father 
committing adultery. Soon afterwards, Eves 
uncle is killed in an auto accident.
What follows is a detailed examination of 
the effects of adultery on a family, lightened 
throughout by humorous episodes and in
teresting characters. Theres Aunt Mozelle 
(Debbi Morgan), who can see the future in 
visions, and another woman who knows voo
doo, played by Diahann Carroll. As they are 
in competing lines of work, they dont get 
along very well. A feisty grandmother and a
strange traveler also keep things lively.
The tale is accompanied by a fresh 
visual text that escapes the Hollywood 
norm. The film opens in black and 
white and then shifts to color. Perhaps 
this lack of color is supposed to make us 
question the events on screena small 
voice saying, Take this with a grain of 
salt. Whatever the meaning, the tech
nique is again employed during 
Mozelles visions that seem to spin 
across the screen. Cinematographer 
Amy Vincent also lets us see the beauty 
ofthe areathemangroves with hang
ing moss, pouring rain, old trees. The 
stillness of these scenes contrasts with 
the volatile plot to good effect.
All of the actors are capable, but 
Jurnee Smollett turns in an especially 
fine performance as Eve. As the center 
of the story  the film is framed by the 
narration of an adult Eve  she is on 
screen for a sizable amount of time, 
and yet is entirely convincing. Only 
once or twice does writer Kasi ..***' i i997TrimarkPicturesLemmons, who also directed, force her Jurnee Smollett stars as 10-year-old Eve Batiste.
into the chronically cute mold, and this is a 
good thing. Its also nice to see Samuel L. 
Jackson outside of his usual sidekick role. 
Perhaps, with Eves Bayou and 187, hes 
finally escaping post-Pulp Fiction typecast
ing and branching out. Also of note are the 
two performances of the prognosticators. 
Diahann Carroll is haunting at times, her 
face painted white and her hair exploding 
with a life of its own. In contrast, her nemesis, 
played by Debbi Morgan, is very human as
the glue that holds the family together.
Taken as a whole, Eves Bayou is a fine film. 
The only drawback is that the story, while 
well-executed, lacks the emotional punch that 
I felt it should have had. Maybe its a personal 
thing, but with an issue that touches so many 
people, I expected to feel something. Never
theless, the movie does have solid perfor
mances from its cast, a nice look, and a solid 
story, and is an admirable outing for first
time director Lemmons.Action flick rehashes same old ideas
By TOM LIANZA
Tartan Staffwriter
In the realm of action-adventure films, it is well known that 
originality is hard to come by. 
The Jackal, in spite of the high 
entertainment value associated 
with action movies, presents ex
tremely few new ideas. Action 
fans will surely enjoy the hightech weaponry and explicit vio
lence. Unfortunately, it has all 
been done before.
What: The Jackal 
Director: Michael CatonJones
Company: Universal 
Pictures/Alphaville Films
The premise is simple despite 
its superficial complexity  in
ternational ramifications were 
mentioned but unnecessary to the 
plot. The Jackal (Bruce Willis) 
is contracted by Soviet cutthroats 
to kill a high-ranking government 
official. He is to perform this as
sassination openly in order to 
strike fear in the very marrow 
of the United States government. 
The FBI is trying to figure out 
how to stop the attempt, but The
Jackal is an anonymous figure, 
who has rarely been seen. He is 
an expert in disguise a trait that 
becomes increasingly obvious 
when Bruce Willis features a new 
hairstyle in each scene.
Enter Declan Mulqueen (Rich
ard Gere). He is a former IRA 
member, and one ofthe few people 
who has actually seen The Jackal 
in person. The FBI takes him out 
of prison and grants him a reduc
tion of sentence in exchange for 
help in stopping the assassina
tion. Mulqueen works with FBI 
Deputy Director Carter Preston 
(Sidney Poitier), and together 
they do their best to follow The 
Jackals every move.
If this plot is starting to sound 
familiar, then perhaps you have 
seen The Rock or Demolition Man. 
Both of these films featured re
leased convicts tracking terror
ists they knew from the past. In 
each case, authorities treated the 
central convict character with dis
dain, and celebrated their 
achievements in the end. Such a 
repetitive plotline smacks of 
unoriginality.
The Jackal himself was a very 
interesting character. It was evi
dent that he was a pro at espio
nage. Bruce Willis is normally 
identifiable as a movie hero, and 
he showed that the role of villain 
wasnt much of a stress on his 
acting talents either. As usual, 
he carries a gun at all times, 
sporting a desensitized attitude 
towards violence typical of bigbudget action flicks.
On the whole, this movie was 
as entertaining as all action mov
ies are, but dont expect any real 
surprises. The Jackal is by no 
means a groundbreaking film, 
and you may catch yourself think
ing Havent I seen this before? 
Richard Gere squeaks out an an
noying Irish accent, but eventu
ally you get accustomed to it, just 
as you get accustomed to the fact 
that the rest of the movie really 
isnt that amazing either.

Bruce Willis stars as The Jackal, a heartless killer hired by the FBI.
