IFC Risk Manager 
resigns from post
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Acting Managing Editor
After issuing citations to a fraternity while 
under the influence of alcohol; the Risk 
Manager for the Interfraternity Council 
(IFC) officially resigned from his post last 
Thursday. IFC will be electing a new Risk 
Manager this upcoming Thursday at the 
general meeting.
Avinash Jain, a junior industrial man
agement major and brother of Sigma Nu, 
attended several fraternity parties on a 
Saturday night earlier this semester in his 
capacity as IFC Risk Manager to ensure 
that the alcohol policy and general guide
lines for social events were being followed. 
Jain, already intoxicated after attending a 
birthday party earlier in the evening, is
sued a citation to a fraternity for breaking 
the alcohol policy. The citation was revoked 
because Jain was intoxicated.
As the Risk Manager on duty, Jain was 
obligated to be sober for the course of the 
evening. Sober, as defined by the IFC, means 
having consumed no alcohol.
I got drunk and went monitoring par
ties.... I could have easily asked someone 
else to take over that night. It was just a 
really big mistake, said Jain.
Eric Grant, president of the IFC and a 
senior double major in political science 
and IDS, said, He resigned of his own 
accord. I think hes made a very conscien
tious choice. I applaud him for making the 
decision he did. He made a wise choice.
I dont think I would have been im
peached, but I would have been brought up 
for impeachment. I just didnt want to drag 
it out.... One reason I resigned was to not 
look like a hypocrite, said Jain.
It makes our house look bad, I think. As 
a member of the executive council of IFC 
he should be a role model, said Matthew 
Podwicki, president of Sigma Nu and a 
junior chemical engineering major. Were 
stillbehind him. People make mistakes, 
he said.

Student Union prints issue after Senate cuts budget

The student co-op on Margaret 
Morrison Street, which has been closed 
since last December, will reopen on Mon
day, September 29. The new store will 
be called Entropy East, although its 
services will differ from those provided 
at Entropy.
Entropy East will provide more gro
cery items, as well as a large selection of 
microwaveable and frozen foods. It will 
be a convenience-type store that will
offer more full-size grocery/snack prod
ucts, frozen foods, microwave foods, 
and sodas, said Patty Stacer, the Di
rector of Campus Services.
The student co-op, which had been in
operation for close to 15 years, was closed 
last December. It was closeiibased on the 
projections that at that time it would not 
have broken even, said Stacer.
This was mainly due to the presence of 
the labor-intensive deli, and unprofitable 
weekend and evening hours, said Stacer. 
Retail Services receives no funding from 
the University.
In their decision to re-open the co-op 
there was also considerable thought as to 
how it could be made economically fea
sible. To acheive this goal, some services 
had to be cut, including the deli.
The deli was a favorite eatery for stu
dents, and offered custom-made sand
wiches, deli salads, mixed greens, and 
fresh fruit salads.

With a staff of five and no Senate 
funding, The Student Union put out 
its first paper of the semester last 
Monday. What was once a tabloid size 
publication, shrank to a four-page 
publication of 11x17 sheets of paper 
folded in half, paid for entirely by The 
Union staff.
The issue cost approximately $300, 
said former Student Union represen
tative Brandy Humphries. In the past, 
the ten-year-old paper was budgeted 
$4,000 to $6,000 per fiscal year.
Student Senates funding and recog
nition committee eliminated The Stu
dent Union's funding during last years 
budget allocations due to insufficient 
production. Last years newspaper 
budgeted for biweekly production, yet 
only two issues .were printed during 
the ten month period.
Senate is wary of [The Student 
Unions] ability to put out a paper,
said Eamon Keleher, funding and rec
ognition chair and a junior mechani
cal engineering major. We didnt 
want to give them money and see it 
happen again.
Keleher said Senate could not afford 
to fund an organization that could po
tentially fold because of their own tight 
financial situation.
First-year student in the professional 
writing masters program Emily 
Piliquist is acting as the papers main 
representative and organizer for the 
next year.
We had a big loss of interest last 
year, said Piliquist. Its hard to put out 
a paper with three people.
Piliquist said The Union received no 
warning from Senate indicating a pos
sible retraction of funded recognition. 
We werent given any other options or 
opportunities to get our act together, 
she said. Weve seen other organiza
tions produce less than The Student 
Union has and they havent had their 
budgeting revoked.
But The Union has been on a downhill
slide for some years now, said Keheler. 
This isnt the first time theyve had 
problems, he said. Nothing specific 
was established to help them out, but if 
they manage to get back on their feet 
they have a better chance of receiving 
money in the future.
The present contributors expect an 
increase in staff members based on 
recruitment numbers from the Activi
ties Fair. We had 47 people sign up at 
our table. I think well get about 12 to 15 
new people from that, but to be honest, 
well still put it out with just five if we 
have to, said Piliquist.
Right now the organization of the 
paper is loose, said Piliquist, but a for
mal hierarchy isnt her answer. Im 
not calling myself an editor-in-chief or 
anything like that. It might just sound 
like semantics, but its supposed to be 
an open forum  a collective, she said.
Acting as the chief organizer, Piliquist 
has put together a publication schedule 
for this semester. The paper will be 
printed by CMU Printing and PublishPlease see UNION, page 5

Many people are excited by 
the prospect of 96 new parking 
spaces. Amidst the sea of as
phalt that is the Morewood park
ing lot, an ancient sycamore tree 
grows. It occupies the equiva
lent of about 12 heavily soughtafter parking spaces. For the 
600 people on the waiting list 
for parking permits, an expan
sion project in the Morewood 
parking lot means at least 96 
new parking spaces, 108 if the 
tree is cut down.
But that would mean sacrific
ing the sycamore tree, which has 
stood in the same spot longer 
than the Morewood parking lot 
has existed. The proposal of cut
ting down the tree first appeared 
to the public in the form of flyers 
put on all the car windshields in 
the parking lot the week before 
last. The response was a modest 
outcry from students and fac
ulty who didnt want the tree to 
be removed.
As major issues go, Im sure 
that there are more important 
ones, but the space occupied by 
the tree is not that large, said 
Monica Cellio, a staff member at 
the Universitys Information 
Network Institute. Its a nice 
touch of green in a sea of pave
ment, and you dont get any ben
efit in removing a tree that was 
perfectly healthy and not doing 
any harm ... the Morewood lot 
has 600 spaces. They can work 
around it.
Currently, the tree is going 
to stay, said Patty Stacer, Di
rector of Campus Services. The 
parking lot is going to be 
restriped more efficiently to add 
more spaces, and the existing 
islands removed.The lot has al
ready been extended on the north 
and west sides.
Cellio, among others, found 
out that the tree was to be cut 
down from postings that were 
sent to almost all of the major 
campus bboards.
Dan Martin, from the CFA 
deans office, wrote the initial
post, which reads: I find it hor
rifying that the university will 
kill this grand act of nature to 
gain, what, 10 to 12 more spaces. 
That tree has always been a brief 
but welcome... moment of beauty 
in an otherwise harsh place.
Martin also addressed the mes
sage to Stacer, and encouraged 
anyone who read the post to re
spond by writing to Stacer.
Martins post triggered sev
eral others to send email, and 
for the moment, their request 
to leave the tree standing has 
been honored.
This past week, the parking 
office left more flyers on car windshields announcing the closure 
of the lot for the weekend to 
continue with construction. The 
flyers did not mention the re
moval of the tree.
However, other administrators 
are not so confident of the trees 
security, or of its health.
[The tree] is going to die real 
soon, said Chuck Weinberg, 
project manager for the construcPlease see TREE, page 5

The Morewood Parking lot was originally constructed around this sycamore tree. Several people 
protested plans to cut down the tree in order to make room for 12 new parking spaces.

NEW YORK (AP)  America 
Online (AOL) will acquire the 2.6 
million subscribers of its closest com
petitor, CompuServe, in a three-way 
deal with WorldCom that reshapes
Block, which owns 80 percent of the 
ailing online service, to exit a market 
that has caused frustrations for more 
than a year. CompuServe, the sec
ond-largest online service behind
the online business. WorldCom, AOL, has been beset by financial
the nations fourth-largest long losses, member defections, and
distance phone company, will Bilk the cancellation of its fampay $1.2 billion for 
CompuServe and sell its 
online business to AOL, 
under the agreement an
nounced Monday.
If approved by govern
ment regulators, the deal 
would erase one of America Onlines 
biggest competitors and aid its goal of 
selling more online advertising. Add
ing CompuServes subscribers to AOLs 
nearly 9 million would create a 
cyberspace behemoth, with 60 percent 
of Americans using the Internet from 
home gaining access through AOL, ac
cording to the Yankee Group, a Bostonbased research firm.
For its part, WorldCom becomes a 
giant in its corner of the Internet, 
expanding its business of providing 
networks for online services and busi
ness customers.
If the sale is completed, AOL will 
operate CompuServe as a separate busi
ness, and online subscribers may notice 
little difference  at least initially.
AOL, which features more enter
tainment services such as games and 
chat lines, doesnt plan to change 
CompuServes online format, which is 
geared to business professionals. Like
wise, AOL doesnt plan to change its 
monthly fee of $19.95 for unlimited 
access or CompuServes fees of up to 
$27.95 a month.
More immediately, some AOL users 
may have an easier time getting online. 
The terms of the deal would give AOL 
access to an additional 100,000 mo
dems from WorldCom, helping ensure 
it wont be hobbled by network bottle
necks that frustrated subscribers with 
busy signals earlier this year.
The complex three-company agree
ment, worked out over the past month, 
enables CompuServe parent H&R
ily-oriented service just 
seven months after it 
was started.
CompuServe pio
neered the online 
business in the 1980s, 
but was overtaken by 
America Online in the 1990s. In addi
tion, other companies were able to 
provide online service such as access 
to the World Wide Web at a lesser 
price than CompuServe.
WorldCom is giving stock worth 
about $1.2 billion to H&R Block, based 
on Fridays closing stock price. It then 
plans to trade CompuServes content 
and its 2.6 million consumer subscrib
ers as well as pay $175 million to AOL.
A larger AOL would be in a better 
position to compete with the 
Microsoft Network.
Analysts said that AOL could snag 
more advertising dollars, which cur
rently comprise about 15 percent of its 
total revenues. One possible scenario 
is giving a break on its ad rates to 
advertisers who place ads in both 
CompuServe and AOLs services.
One of the precepts in the Internet 
advertising area is the ad dollars will 
flow to the largest player in a dispro
portionate manner because youre an 
easier buy for advertisers, said 
Abhishek Gami, an analyst with 
Nesbitt Burns Securities.
The deal also helps AOL cope with 
a more immediate challenge. The 
company has been rapidly upgrad
ing its network of modems, comput
ers and networking equipment after 
problems with network bottlenecks 
earlier this year.
Under an agreement with states in 
February, AOL gave refunds to cus
tomers with trouble logging on in De
cember and January.
Processor-makers form partnership
NEW YORK (AP)Three major com
puter chip-making rivals are joining with 
the U.S. government in a partnership to 
work on ways to dramatically shrink 
microprocessor circuits, an advance that 
could make computers 100 times faster.
The venture links commercial efforts 
by Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices 
Inc. (AMD), and Motorola Corp. with 
three U.S. Department of Energy labs.
The partnership plans to design a new 
technique for etching ever-tinier pat
terns in silicon chips, enabling more 
transistors to be crammed into each 
microprocessor. The technique employs 
ultraviolet light to etch lines smaller 
than the patterns in the most sophisti
cated chips now available.
The goal is to be able to cram 1 billion 
transistors onto each thumbnail-size 
chip, which acts as the brains of comput
ers, by the year 2011, a stated goal of 
Intel chairman Andrew Grove. Currently, 
Intels most powerful processor contains 
7.5 million transistors. In addition to 
making microprocessors 100 times more 
powerful, the companies said memory 
chips would be able to store 1,000 times 
more information than currently possible.
Intel, AMD, and Motorola have formed 
a new company, called EUV LLC, that 
will invest $250 million over the next 
three years to push development of the 
extreme ultraviolet lithography.Fires burn forests near Machu Pichu
LIMA, Peru (AP)  Fires burned out 
of control for a fifth day Wednesday in 
the mountains surrounding the Incan 
ruins of Machu Picchu, destroying spec
tacular tropical forests and filling the 
ruins with smoke.
While South Americas top archaeo
logical treasure was safe, experts feared 
the destruction of thousands of acres of 
nearby forest and smoke damage to the 
stone ruins would damage Machu 
Picchus attraction to tourists. The ru
ins sit atop a craggy peak high in Perus 
southern Andes Mountains. The fires 
have left the critical zonewhere there 
are archaeological monuments and popu
lated centers  but still burn with in
tensity, the government said.

flame retardants on dense vegetation in 
front of the flames to prevent them from 
spreading to archaeological sites.
A nearby tourist hotel and 500 resi
dents who live near the ruins have been 
evacuated, and tourist visits to the area 
have been suspended until at least Sun
day. The Inca Trail, a favorite hiking 
route for backpackers, is closed.
Despite Machu Picchus apparent 
safety, hotel managers and archaeolo
gists said they are concerned about the 
damage the fire could do to tourism. 
Machu Picchu, located 300 miles south
east of Lima, is Perus top tourist attrac
tion, drawing 1,000 visitors a day.
The fire was apparently started Sat
urday by peasants burning weeds to 
clear farmland on the banks of the nearby 
Urubamba River. A drought that has 
dried out vegetation in the area has 
accelerated the fires spread.

Mars Observer is believed to have caused 
an explosion that sent that spacecraft

Over the course of four months, con

series of maneuvers called aerobraking 
that take advantage of atmospheric drag. 
The result will be a nearly circular orbit

nothing out of the ordinary.
The cadet was one of the first 30 women

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)  A 
Georgia-Pacific Corp. plant blew 
up while chemicals were being 
mixed to make glue Wednesday. 
One worker was missing and presumed dead, and nine other
 people were hurt.
The explosion rattled windows 
up to seven miles away and blew 
away about half the roof but left 
some of the walls standing. By
standers in Columbus, Ohio, ex
amined damage from the explo
sion on Wednesday.
We thought it was a bomb. It 
was so loud, said Patrick Stewart, 
who was teaching a Bible class at 
a church a quarter-mile away.
Nearby buildings in the indus
trial area were evacuated after
ward because of a chemical odor. 
Everyone was allowed back four 
hours later.
The plant on the citys east side 
produces resins for industrial use 
and wood products.
. The explosion happened in a 
kettle where sulfuric acid, phe
nol and formaldehyde were be
ing mixed to make a wood adhe
sive, said Andy Norman, a re
gional manufacturing manager 
for Georgia-Pacific.
Theres no way to tell what 
happened, he said. The missing 
worker was standing about 10
feet from the kettle, said Fire 
Chief Dan Vincent. He said he 
had little hope the worker would 
be found alive.
There were 14 other workers in 
the plant at the time, Vincent said.
One plant worker was hospi
talized in serious condition with 
head injuries, and a firefighter 
was listed in fair condition. The 
others injured, including another 
firefighter and two people who 
worked at businesses nearby, 
were not seriously hurt.
Both phenol and formaldehyde, 
which is flammable, escaped into 
the air, said police spokesperson 
Gayle Conner. However, the
chemicals posed no danger to 
people or the environment, said 
Melissa Riley Patsiavos, spokes
person for the Ohio Environmen
tal Protection Agency.
A few residents complained that 
the chemical burned their noses 
and throats, but Patsiavos said 
they probably wouldnt have any 
long-term effects.
The explosion shook homes 
miles away, knocking objects 
off shelves.
It really shook the building, 
said Sharon Mittenbergs, a 
worker at Jefferson Smurfit 
Corp., a cardboard manufacturer 
a mile from the plant.

University speech. This promise 
was made despite a projected 
CMU operating deficit of $800 
thousand added to a total deficit 
of $1.5 million from 1972. Cyert 
noted that budget problems could 
worsen before they got better. 
Cyert mentioned several other 
campus issues in the speech. He
said he was opposed to subsidies 
for services that benefit part of 
the campus at the expense of the 
whole, specifically food service 
and dormitories. About 70 stu

of a water main break and a heavy 
rainstorm spelled disaster for the 
Wean Hall and Bureau of Mines 
area of campus on September 8. 
A water pipe near the fifth floor 
entrance of Wean Hall broke 
around 3 am, causing water to 
burst above ground and rush 
down the stairs of the Wean Hall 
patio. Still more water flooded 
parts of Wean Hall and the steam 
tunnels. At the same time, a sud

than the storm sewers could 
handle. The E&S Library and 
Robotics Institute, the print shops
in Doherty Hall, Hamerschlag 
Hall D-level, and the Morewood 
Gardens Child Care Center were 
flooded. Also, in addition to the 
flooding, the Bureau of Mines 
road behind Wean and 
Hamerschlag Halls collapsed. 
The combination of the excava

Crime and Incident Report
8/30 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,
9:24 pm  Officers were notified of a 
spray paint can that was thrown out 
onto Morewood Avenue from a frater
nity house. A car drove over the can, 
causing it explode, spraying orange paint 
on the road. In addition, two men were 
seen spray-painting on the sidewalk.
The officer identified the actors and told 
the fraternity that if the street was not 
cleaned off by 6 am the next morning,
Campus Police would call Division for 
clean-up, and the price of the clean-up 
would then resort to the fraternity pay
ment. The fraternity was issued an in
ternal citation for the disorderly con
duct for the actions of the actors associ
ated with the house.
8/31 ARSON,4:27 am  A resident of 
a fraternity called Campus Police to 
report that members of another frater
nity had thrown a burning scarecrow 
onto their benches. Members of the house 
had extinguished the flame prior to their 
arrival. There were about eight people 
on a neighboring fraternity porch who 
fled as soon as the police arrived on the 
scene. Since the actors had fled into the 
house and were shouting jeers at the 
police and the victimized fraternity, it 
was decided that investigating further
Student Senate Minutes
would be counterproductive. The frater
nity porch suffered scorch marks.
8/31 PUBLIC URINATION,4:43 am 
 A student was seen urinating on the 
wall of a fraternity. After allowing him 
to finish, the officer identified the man 
and issued him a CMU internal citation 
for public urination.
9/1 MEDICAL EMERGENCY, 12:57 
pm  A student was assembling an Ab 
Flex exercising machine when a part of 
a metal ball slipped, hitting the student 
on his top lip causing a laceration. EMS 
dressed the wound and transported him 
to the hospital.
9/1 THEFT, 2:43 pm  A sorority 
member reported to Campus Police that 
sometime over the night someone re
moved the sorority houses Greek letters 
from the house entrance door. The sign 
was secured with six screws.
9/4 OVERTURNED CAR, 2:06 pm 
While on a routine check of the frater
nities, a police officer noticed a tan Ford 
Escort on its roof in front of a fraternity 
house. The car was totalled with various 
pieces of metal and glass strewn about 
the fraternity yard. A check with Stu
dent Life revealed that it was not an 
approved event. A tow truck was to be 
called to remove the vehicle and clean 
up the debris. The fraternity was to be 
billed and fined for the incident.
9/6 MEDICAL, 8:45 pm  An officer 
was finishing desk relief when a student 
came into the office requesting a first aid 
kit. He had been angry at someone else 
and decided to vent his frustration by 
punching a filing cabinet located in his 
dormitory room. He sustained a 1/2 inch 
laceration to the middle knuckle of the 
ring finger on his right hand. EMS was 
notified. After dressing the injury, Campus 
Police transported him to the hospital.

fraternity he cited, Jain was not 
stamped as an underage guest.
As Risk Manager, Jain was also 
responsible for enforcing the use of 
beverage cards and verifying that at 
least five members of the fraternity 
hosting the social event are on sober 
patrol for the evening. Beverage 
cards are given to guests over the 
age of 20 that have brought their 
own alcohol to the event.
A guest can obtain alcohol at a 
social event only after presenting 
the card to a bartender on sober 
patrol.
Although it is not stated in the 
Risk Management Agreement, it is 
understood that IFC executives 
monitoring social events should be 
sober.
According to the agreement, IFC 
Executive officers including Risk 
Managers must be admitted at any 
social event to monitor the event in 
an advisory capacity.
Article VI of the document states 
that the IFC Monitoring Team, 
President, Risk Manager, and the
Judicial Board may levy fines and 
penalties against any fraternity that 
does not abide by the rules in the 
agreement.
[Resigning] was the right thing to 
do. The position had a lot of power. It 
doesnt make a good example when 
I, the person that busts people, was 
intoxicated, said Jain.
Nominations for the new Risk Man
ager will be taken prior to the elec
tions at Thursdays IFC meeting. 
Id like to see someone who can 
conscientiously uphold the policies 
of the IFC, said Grant.
Jain has apologized to several of 
the brothers at the house he issued a 
citation. He will not be facing any 
further penalties for his actions.
When I was Risk Manager for 
[Sigma Nu] we had no fines. We ran 
a tight ship. I got my house to adopt 
the BYOB policy quickly. I think if 
you ask any house they would say 
that I did a pretty good job [as IFC 
Risk Manager], said Jain. Jain is 
also the Student Body Treasurer.
This was an isolated incident and 
does not reflect on my house at all, 
said Jain. I hardly ever drink.... 
Its ironic.

TREE, from page 1
tion in the Morewood parking 
lot. Its dying right now. If you 
look closely at the center of the 
trunks, its dying. Everybodys 
complaining about keep the 
tree, but down the road, its 
going to be dead. Is the 10 to 12 
spaces worth the sacrifice of 
the tree to the 600+ people 
waiting in line to get parking 
permits? Thats completely a
matter of opinion If Im told
to cut it down, Ill take it down.
Weinbergs job is to oversee 
construction jobs on campus 
from their inception.
Other plans for the lot in
clude new aluminum light 
poles, drainage work on the 
west side of the lot (close to 
WQED), and an entirely new 
planting scheme, which would 
put trees and foliage back in 
the lot.
[Those plans] are not hap
pening right now because of 
financial restraints, said 
Weinberg. Theres not enough 
funding in the budget. Right 
now the plan is that its going 
to happen, but theres not 
enough funding. If no more 
funding becomes available, I 
will relocate the wooden light 
poles and that will be the end 
of the project.
Ron Carter, assistant vicepresident for Facilities Man
agement Services, said that the 
issues of parking on campus 
conflict with the sentiments of 
many students and faculty to 
keep the tree.
Were dealing with two 
tough things, said Carter. No 
one likes to take trees down... 
but we also have a parking 
problem, and that tree takes
up 12 spaces. We [parking ad
ministrators] debated taking the 
tree down quite a bit, but that 
was coupled with a plan, a verbal 
plan, to put trees back in the lot, 
and until we had that plan final
ized, we decided to hold off on 
cutting it down.
Neal Binstock, Assistant Vice 
President for Business Services, 
said that a small committee of 
administrators has recently been 
established to look at parking 
problems on campus overall. A 
standing University Parking 
Committee also exists.
[The University Parking Com
mittee] is comprised of graduate 
students, undergraduate stu
dents, faculty, and staff. The new 
committee is a smaller group of 
administrators [jwjho will] ad
dress the immediate problem of 
parking.... The purpose of this 
group is to do a very in-depth 
study for parking bver the next 
five to 10 years.
According to Binstock, this 
committee will investigate po
tential options for parking, such 
as finding ways for people to get 
to campus through public trans
portation, or using off-campus 
parking in conjunction with a 
shuttle system.
At best, all of these ideas are 
branstormed ideas on a flip chart 
and would require a lot of inves
tigation, said Binstock.
For right now, the sycamore 
tree is safe to continue provid
ing shade to those members of 
the campus community lucky 
enough to be able to park in 
the Morewood Qardens park
ing lot. However) the pressing 
problem of overdrbwded cam
pus parking may threaten it in 
the future.

Hours will also be short
ened from those kept prior 
to the closing. Entropy 
East will be open Monday 
through Friday, from 10 
am to 6 pm.
When we did the analy
sis of hours for late eve
nings and weekends, we 
found it was just not costeffective to remain open at 
those times, said Stacer.
Once open, however, Re
tail Services plans to re
view the hours, and possi
bly revise them.
I used to live in Schlag, 
and the times I used to 
want to go over to the co-op 
were not the times they 
had listed, it was more on 
the weekends and early 
evenings, said Matt 
Phelps, a junior in ECE.
I live up in Roselawn.
Im really looking forward 
to it opening again, because 
its a pain to get up to Entropy, 
said Will Toraason, ajunior phys
ics major. I just hope they will 
have decent store hours.

Entropy East will open on September 29 in the old Co-op storefront in the Margaret Morrison Plaza.

who were contacted.

ing Services; their former printer refused to 
publish The Union because of content. Its 
going to cost us twice as much to print now 
because CMU charges so much more than 
other printers, said Humphries.
The Union has plans to request a special 
allocation for funding from Student Senate 
after the next two issues go to print, but 
until then funding will continue to 
come out of their pockets.
Were hoping that if we show Sen
ate that weve met our goal theyll 
give us the money, said Piliquist.
Its kind of a paradox that we have 
recognition but no funding. No ex
act figure for the special allocation 
fundingrequesthas been determined.
Right now Im broke, said Piliquist. I 
know how to cut corners and work with 
budgets, but we just cant afford to pay for the 
paper ourselves for very long.

ation and how much money they have avail
able for special projects.
Its hard to say without knowing what 
[The Union] is looking for, said Keheler. I 
mean, we might not have the money to even 
make a difference in cost. It costs more than 
$ 100 to put out a paper, but Im not sure 
what they want from us right now. 
The Unions next issue, a spe
cial edition, will come out on 
September 22. Students dont 
know what the Student Union 
is anymore, sid Piliquist. 
There are few students on cam
pus that were around when we 
were really printing. We need 
to reintroduce the paper to 
newer classes.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Cohon addresses 
CMU employees
In his address to the staff on Septem
ber 10, President Cohon praised , the 
work of Carnegie Mellon employees and 
pledged that staff development, train
ing and access to educational opportu
nities for staff will be key issues during 
his tenure. Among the leading issues 
in our strategic planning process for me 
will be staff development, which I think 
is of the utmost importance for the 
future of this institution, Cohon said. 
Whether you work in the HUB, man
age the business affairs of a depart
ment, or plant flowers in front of Scaife 
Hall, you ai}e contributing to the suc
cess of Carnegie Mellon. We are what 
we are because of you. He also said, 
You are also representing Carnegie 
Mellon.... To the people you meet, you 
are Carnegie Mellon. It is important, 
therefore, that our staff be as good as 
they can be. To me that means educa
tional opportunities should be avail
able to all members of our community 
with as few barriers as reasonably pos
sible. Cohon addressed questions sub
mitted by staff members regarding hir
ing practices and promotions, tuition 
benefits for children, total quality man
agement and reengineering, health ben
efits and flex-time.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University15 September 1997
CgR ds.n2F a22.I v.r 
8F.I6) Lml1
In order to provide students 
with the opportunity to balance 
academics with extracurricular 
activities and meet basic per
sonal needs, the University has 
created a policy restricting 
classes between 4:30 and 6:30. 
Unfortunately, this policy is not 
enforced with any sort of vigor 
many students are forced to 
endure tediously long days be
cause of dense scheduling.
CMU is an academically in
tense community; it is often easy 
to forget that life exists out of 
the classroom. Students should 
be allowed time during the day 
to take part in student organiza
tions, athletics, or other activi
ties. However, setting up group 
meetings can be difficult to 
schedule if students can feasi
bly be in class from 8 am to 5pm 
everday of the week.
The break between 4:30 and 
6:30 serves functions other than 
a common meeting time for stu
dent activities. The free time 
allows students a time in their 
tight schedules to relax, run er
rands, spend time with people, 
or just get off campus for a short 
breather.
The HUB, which handles class 
schedules obviously ignores the 
policy to the point that most 
students are not aware that such 
a policy exists. All requests for 
exceptions must generally be 
submitted in writing to Enroll
ment Services for review along 
with reasons why the class meet
ing can only be held during those 
times. The HUB has become too
lenient when reviewing special 
cases.
By ignoring the policy, the Uni
versity is sending a conflicting 
message to students; one that says 
CMU does not encourage any kind 
of enrichment or relaxation. When 
first-years arrive on campus they 
are inundated with time manage
ment, stress management, and 
how-to-make-the-best-out-ofyour-college-life advice. Students 
are told that balance is the key to 
success, but it is evident that the 
University does not support that 
idea since classes are scheduled 
during times designated for nonacademic activities.
While students will inevitably 
be forced to make time manage
ment decisions at some point in 
their college careers, they should 
be given the choice to partici
pate in other activities if they 
choose.
If classroom space is a reason 
for the violation of policy, then 
more classes should be held af
ter 6:30, when space is abun
dant on campus.
The HUB has been issued a 
policy out of concern for studnt 
well-being and if they choose to 
violate it then it is the responsi
bility of administrators to rec
tify the situation. Setting aside 
time for non-work related ac
tivities is generally a difficult 
process on this campus  the 
administration should encour
age students to take time out of 
their busy days to unwind make 
the most of their college experi
ence.

Recent projects by the Robot
ics Institute has caught the at
tention of the general public as 
of late; every where you turn 
CMU is making headlines. The 
No Hands Across America 
project caught the attention of 
talkshow host Jay Leno and 
more recently the team appeared 
on The Today Show. In early 
August researchers Chuck 
Thorpe, dean Pomerleau, and 
Todd Jochem appeared on CBS 
This Morning and The 
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.
What does this mean for CMU? 
Press coverage of Robotics 
projects spanning from digital 
media to automous navigation 
to medical robotics, will improve 
CMUs reputation holistically.

an unreasonable amount of time. I can
not understand why anybody (Kappa 
Sigma) would want, much less feel it is 
their right, to turn what was once a 
symbol of free speech into a commercial 
device. Thats what you (Kappa Sigma) 
have done, in case you (Kappa Sigma) 
didnt realize.
I recall way back in my freshman year 
when individuals would step up and 
paint the inside of their heads all over 
the fence. I could plod to my first class 
knowing that in all likelihood I would 
enjoy at least a few seconds of novelty on 
the way. Not anymore.
Now, I know what Im going to see: an 
advertisement. If these ads are trying to 
generate interest in people who are not 
already interested in whatever it is youre 
advertising, then whoever makes them 
is sadly misled as to their effectiveness. 
The fence just doesnt have the visual 
space to make an ad that will catch the 
eye. If you think about it for just a 
second, I believe youll agree. Therefore, 
the only people who will even look at 
your ad are those who already are inter
ested in its general topic, people who can 
be reached in better ways, less expen
sive in time, money, and effort. Infor
mally, I have asked several people in the 
cluster in which Im typing this who has 
the fence right now, and no one could tell 
me. However, they did volunteer that 
whoever has it has held it for a while.
Dont misunderstand me, I have noth
ing against organizational or even com
mercial use of the fence. I just feel that 
extended use of it in these ways incurs 
an injustice on our campus.
Indeed, a lasting injustice, as I see the 
lowerclassmen getting the wrong im
pression about the fences purpose and 
meaning. I fear that if the fence ever 
stops being abused, people might not
remember what it is really for and how 
they can use it properly.
The cost of abusing the fence is more 
than symbolic; it destroys the real op
portunity each of us may once again 
have of expressing ourselves to the cam
pus in a convenient and visible way.
My personal suggestion is to place a 
maximum- time limit on control of the 
fence. I believe two days, three at maxi
mum, to be a reasonable period of time. 
At the very least, I would like an open 
dialogue on the matter established 
within whatever body has jurisdiction of 
such matters.

In UPS strikes down 
workers with contract/
Strike results in loss of 
jobs, [9/8/97] James 
Stepanek asserts that 
only those with a so
cialist worldview could mistake the 
outcome of the strike for a victory for 
labor; instead, he contends that the re
cent UPS strike was a loss for both 
workers and the company, and that only 
the Teamster unions leaders benefitted 
significantly from the strike. To the con
trary, the UPS strike actually repre
sents a major gain for UPS employees, 
and a ray of hope for labor in general. 
Stepanek rests his case on many highly 
questionable arguments, the most promi
nent of which is his claim that convert
ing part-time UPS jobs to fall-time posi
tions will leave significant numbers of 
UPS workers unemployed. This is utter 
hogwash.
Stepanek totally misunderstands the 
main issues of the strike: he thinks that 
a lucky 10,000 will get more hours, 
while other people get the shaft; further
more, he imagines that many people 
will get screwed when their part-time 
job becomes full-time, and they dont 
have the time.
Letter to 
the Editor
In the Orwellian world of UPS, how
ever, full-time employees dont neces
sarily work more hours than part-time 
workers; in fact, before the strike, 10,000 
people were working an average of 35 or 
more hours a week at UPS for part-time 
wages and benefits. Furthermore, the 
annual turnover rate of UPS part-tim
ers has been 400%; a Cornell University 
researcher found that part-timers most 
common reason for leaving was the lack 
of opportunity to advance to full-time. 
So its very hard to see how the union has 
betrayed the workers in this strike settle
ment. But despite his posing and postur
ing to the contrary, Stepanek isnt really 
all that worried about the concerns of 
the workers  hes on the companys 
side. His fundamental allegiance is alltoo-legible in the way he spins numer
ous points of detail.
For instance, Stepanek accepts as fact [ 
company predictions that significant 
long-term layoffs will result from the 
business lost during the strike; he does 
not stop to appreciate the fact that the 
strikers ability to win a short and very 
necessary strike significantly reduces 
the threat of significant permanent job 
losses at UPS. Likewise, Stepanek con
cedes that part-time UPS workers begin 
at $8/hour, but he neglects to mention 
that before the strike the starting wage 
had been petrified at that level for 15 
years. The bottom line is that the out
come of the strike is something that the 
vast majority of us, socialist or not, can 
celebrate. Most of us already knew that 
further cooperation with management 
would yield nothing; the strikers showed 
that solidarity among part-time and full
time workers, and between organized 
labor and the larger public, can achieve 
much. And only someone with a dog
matically capitalist worldview, such i 
James Stepanek, could write so aggres
sively, and on the basis of so little re
search, to the contrary.

There has been a 
combination of 
good and interest
ing news this summer. It all can be 
tied together
through a common thread. This thread was the passage of 
Proposition 209 in California in 1996.
In case some of you dont recall this law, it was the referen
dum to end affirmative action in government hiring. It stated 
that the state could not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, 
or religion, unless in a case of common sense. It, in fact, almost 
duplicated the wording of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, which 
are the cornerstones of modern civil rights legislation. The 
irony of the situation is that this wording had to be passed into 
law because the wording of the federal law has been ignored 
by the courts. Affirmative action is, in fact, a direct contradic
tion of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts, but this law was turned on 
its head by activist judges. The good news, which I mentioned 
above, is that in spite of repeated attempts by Californian 
leftists to destroy this law, it has made it through the courts. 
I must say that the attempts by the Left to have this law 
struck down border on the ludicrous. The good thing is that a 
ninth circuit court judge in California agreed with me.
The American Civil Liberties Union, and a number of other 
leftist groups, challenged this law on the basis that it violates 
the equal protection clause of the Constitution and thus 
discriminates. How about that? A law which explicitly bars 
discrimination is discriminatory. George Orwell must be
spinning in his.grave. Their convoluted logic made the case 
that since veterans and relatives of alumni can be given 
special treatment, it is discriminatory that minorities cannot.
This claim is a load of rubbish on a number of grounds. First 
of all, minorities are represented in disproportionally high 
numbers in the military, and thus have more to gain from 
those opportunities, so there went that claim. Secondly, the 
fact that alumni are granted some perks is a colorblind 
business as well. This is no more favorable to people of any 
race who have attended a given school. The simple truth is 
that the claims were utterly specious, and the greatest shame 
in the proceedings is that it took an appeals court judge to 
finally throw them out.
Thus, the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), as 
Proposition 209 is also known, is now going into effect. What 
i$ it doing? Well, a curious, but possibly expected, effect is that 
minority applications and acceptances at some of the major 
California universities are down. I know there will be those 
who decry this as racism, but lets look at the facts. The staff 
of the universities did not change overnight from the militant 
supporters of affirmative action into something else. They did 
not suddenly don bedsheets and hoods, and become followers 
of David Duke. No, these are the same leftist university 
administrators as before; they simply cannot ignore qualifi
cations anymore.
Where do these minority individuals go? They go to colleges 
and universities more suited to their abilities. This is, in fact, 
doing them a favor. It doesnt do some poor guy any good to get

Jenny Garcia de Osuna
By the end of this month, all the 
dorms (including on-campus apart
ments and Greek housing) will be re
ceiving free cable TV. In a campus so 
famous for its stressful workloads and 
lack of entertaining activities, free cable 
television serves as a refreshing treat 
for all residents.
Housing decided to spend almost half 
a million dollars to install the cable 
system and it may cause people to ques
tion whether the money was worth it. 
Comments that the money could have 
been used to benefit non-television view
ers as well abound. However, there is 
more to the issue than just giving us a 
chance to watch Beavis and Butthead 
all day long. Having cable installed in 
rooms can give rise to televised lectures 
and other classroom aids. With an in
creasing number of students at CMU 
each year, it may not be farfetched to 
videotape large freshman seminar 
classes or provide review sessions via 
cable networks.
Also, cable gives us access not only to 
entertaining movies and music videos, 
but to international news, sports, and 
interesting documentaries. It is a shame 
that many students become isolated 
from the news during the college years 
and an increased access to the world can 
only be beneficial.
The cliche that television just sucks 
our mind away is an ignorant one. 
Though it is true that are numerous 
mindless sitcoms, there are also quite 
interesting programs and it is up to the 
viewer to decide what to watch. As al
ways, moderation is key. In my experience, it seems few CMU students spend 
hours on end watching the boob tube 
and few plan on doing so with the new 
cable around. Instead, it adds to the list of 
relaxing ways to spend a study break or a 
Friday night.
Now, there needs to be a distinction 
between having cable available and 
watching television 24 hours a day. I 
doubt that this new privilege is now going 
to turn hard-working students into zom
bies stuck to the television screen. Hav
ing cable around is not going to prevent
Rebecca Fribush
Housing is in the process of having all of 
our dorms wired so we can receive free cable 
television starting September 30. Think 
this is cause for universal rejoicing? Per
haps you may want to think again.
Bruce Taylor, New Products Coordinator 
for Campus Telecommunications, estimates 
the cost of installing the entire cable system
students from going out with friends, or 
even reading a book. And if it does, it is 
hardly Housings fault.
Instead, we should appreciate Housing 
for understanding the benefits (both en
tertainment and educational) of having 
cable television available.
With the new cable television around, 
students can find new ways to have fun, 
and faculty will have more means to 
supplement their curricula.

at $475,000. This is quite a lot of money. 
Students arent; being directly charged for 
the cost of cable, which means this is all 
coming from the pockets of Housing. There 
are so many more pressing projects Hous
ing could have undertaken with this large 
sum of money. The new dorm being planned 
between Morewood and Mudge could prob
ably use more financing, as well. Students 
may not be directly paying for this cable 
wiring, but that doesnt mean we wont 
eventually see it reflected in higher prices 
for campus housing.
Its hard not to appreciate the prospect of 
the University recognizing that our over
worked student body needs to unwind, of
course. But why is it that they think pre
senting us with 46 channels of TV for our 
vegetating pleasure is the best way to do 
this? If it were set on financing our relax
ation, Carnegie Mellon could come up with 
much better ways to do so. How about 
improved recreational and common areas 
in the dorms? How about expanding the 
Carnegie Express program, which provides 
transportation for students who want to get 
off campus? Unlike cable TV* these would 
be things all students, not just those who 
own television sets, could use. Earmarking 
these funds for a benefit that can mainly be 
enjoyed by the minority of students with 
TVs isnt fair. I dont know about you, but 
Im getting tired of people assuming that 
everyone our age fits the stereotypical 
Generation-X image. Watching TV, the 
more the better, is not our chief source of 
stimulation and fun. Behind the 
Universitys gift of free cable for every
one lies a pretty insulting presumption 
that it is. Sure, we need relaxation to com
bat the stress and rigor of our academic 
lives. But because we work so hard in class, 
most of us are likely to follow the path of 
least resistance when were outside of it. 
And beaming the likes of Milli Vanilli 
Unplugged MTV specials into our rooms 
free of charge isnt helping any. Instead of 
going off to socialize or get involved in 
extracurricular activities, it will now be 
even more tempting for students to take out 
their remote controls and zone out. Free 
cable television in the dorms is not one of 
Carnegie Mellons brighter ideas. It siphons 
off money that could have gone to making 
life better in the campus community to 
finance an activity that serves virtually no 
purpose except to suck up students time.

into a school for which he is 
intellectually or educationally 
ill-equipped. Admissions of mi
norities to the second tier of the 
University of California sys
tem have increased in a com
pensatory manner.
These changes dont simply 
benefit the person who goes to 
a college which is a better match 
for him, it also prevents people 
who are not qualified from get
ting into important positions. 
This is a particularly impor
tant thing in some professions 
such as medicine. Recently, an 
indicative case has come to light 
in this regard.
It is a particularly telling ex
ample of where affirmative ac
tion can go wrong. To give some 
background, back in the seven
ties a black man, Patrick 
Chavis, was offered a spot in 
medical school ahead of Alan 
Bakke. a white who had better 
qualifications. Chavis has since 
been lauded by leftists as a 
worthy recipient of affirmative 
action, and has had his obstet
rics practice in central LA cited 
as an example of how he makes 
a worthy addition to society.
Well, the promotion of the less 
competent has come back to 
haunt us.
Dr. Chavis has been found 
guilty of gross negligence and 
incompetence in his medical 
practice. He decided that he 
wanted to make more money on 
the side and started giving 
liposuctions. However, he 
didnt bother to get adequate 
training. As as result of this, 
two of his patients were injured 
and one died.
Granted, the case of Dr. 
Chavis cannot be seen as any
thing but an example of what an 
unqualified doctor may do. It is 
not an indictment of black doc
tors, or those of any other minor
ity. It is, as one must under
stand, a very good reason for the 
abolition of affirmative action.
One cannot allow people to 
be passed along without regard 
to their qualifications into po
sitions where they have the 
ability to kill people through 
negligence.

I found something inher
ently disturbing in learningJoshu^Wa^trom of Mother
Teresas death
from my Internet search engine, yet there it 
was, flashing in bright red letters at the top of 
the screen: Mother Teresa dies at the age of 
87. People were pausing to mourn everywhere 
but at CMU.
In newspapers and television broadcasts all over 
the world, the elderly nun of Calcutta was being 
remembered for her lifelong devotion to the poor 
and indigent.
Even after Yahoo flashed the news across my 
monitor, the loss seemed unreal. The usual reac
tions that follow the death of a famous figurethe 
shocked conversations amongfriends and co-work
ers, the hastily-assembled memorials on televi
sion and in magazineswere markedly absent 
from the CMU routine.
That the death of so notable a person went 
largely unnoticed by students illustrates how far 
removed college life is from the immediate hap
penings of the world. CMU didnt forget Mother 
Teresa out of callousness or indifference.
She wasnt lost in the general apathy that wrongly 
stereotypes most CMU students. Instead, she was 
forgotten simply because its easy to forget.
Those living at CMU without cars or televisions 
find it easy to become disconnected from the larger 
human society.
It is, in many respects, like living in a small 
town, where the daily routine seldom breaks and 
every face is a familiar one, where worldly affairs 
the passing of a princess, the death of a spiritual 
icon  are largely irrelevant to daily student life.
But a television gives even the most obscure 
town a window to every corner of the world. Of 
the millions who watched Princess Dianas fu
neral, many watched from tiny hamlets, the kind 
no princess ever visited, and wept for someone 
they only knew from the glowing screen. There 
is much to be said for this immediacy of televi
sion, for this ability to convey the death of some
one thousands of miles away with the same 
impact as a local tragedy.
There are plenty of critics who blame television 
for the decline of the West.
Divorce, youth violence, societal apathy, the 
general fractionalization of American culture  
all of it is a product of American television.
Yet these critics forget moments like the death 
of Mother Teresa or Princess Diana, when the 
television brings together millions in sad con
templation of human mortality.
They forget the Challenger explosion, the as
sassination of JFK, the Apollo moon mission. In 
fact, every great moment of American communal 
experience in the last half century was connected 
in some way with the television. It just may be 
that the television is the last common ground in 
American society.
Certainly, Im not advocating that every 
CMU student run to the nearest TV lounge 
and binge to make up for all the lost hours in 
front of the tube.
As with life in general, moderation is every
thing, but a few hours here and there is reason
able, just enough to forget the daily grind of 
academia for one brief moment and touch base 
with the world.

when the information is presumed to be profoundly uncertain. This summer she studied risk communi
cation in South African mines funded by the National Science Foundation. She says this about the 
book:
When Cry the Beloved Country was first published, this lyric novel revealed the 
horrors of South African racial policies. The novel also predicted the consequences 
that would occur if such policies continued. After 50 years, the novel still pro
vides a powerful and accurate depiction of the problems  for Blacks and Whites 
 which persist in the New South Africa.
During her visit to South Africa, Sauer videotaped South Africans as they spoke about the problems of 
race, economics, family, work, and political change in the New South Africa. In her talk, Sauer will 
discuss the ways that new literary and political sensitivities to race and language might challenge our 
reassessment of the novel.

MLB changes loom in future
The Hot Comer
By Matthew James Cuccaro
In the fall of 1993, I was, plain and 
Simple, a dumb high school kid. I was 
entering my senior year, I was learning 
how to drive, and I cared more about 
watching cartoons than I did about ap
plying to college. I watched the Blue 
Jays win the American League Champi
onship Series over the White Sox and 
the Phillies beat the Braves in the NLCS. 
1993 marked the last season that the 
only two existing division winners played 
just one round of playoffs prior to the 
World Series. This week Im looking at 
baseballs current three division/wild 
card playoff system.
In 1994, when the baseball owners 
introduced the three division format and 
wild card concept to Major League Base
ball, I was very skeptical. I thought that 
three divisions were unnecessary, and 
that adding a wild card spot would wa
ter down the playoffs. But after seeing 
the positive effects the change has had 
ton the game, I have in fact become a fan 
pf the three division system, 
j Without two extra playoffs spots made 
available, we would be watching (or, 
more likely, ignoring) endless insignifi
cant games. Instead of devoting our lives 
to reading email and watching the Pi
rates desperately chase the Astros for 
the division crown, we would be seeing 
the Braves (formerly of the NL West) 
'and Marlins run away with their respec
tive division titles (but at least wed still 
have email). In the American League, 
the Indians would be in third, 11 or so 
games behind first place Balti
more, rather than playing 
crucial games versus 
the White Sox 
throughout Sep
tember. The Red 
Sox, though, 
would suck no mat
ter what.
However, the sys
tem does have its 
faults. Currently, pair
ings for the Division Se
ries are determined well 
before the playoffs begin, 
in order to sell tickets in 
advance, reserve sta
dium dates, etc. Also, 
the wild card team is 
not allowed to play an
other team from its own 
division in the first 
round of the playoffs.
To the baseball owners 
I say, Dudes, screw 
that, I got something to 
say. At the end of the 
regular season, seed all 
the teams based on their 
records, havingteam one play 
team four while teams two 
and three play each other.
Give teams with the better 
record home field advantage 
throughout the playoffs, and 
play a 2-2-1 first round series 
(instead of the 2-3-2 system 
used now).
Although the recommendations make 
sense (in my mind at 
least), I dont think the 
owners will listen to
them. First of all, my name is Coox and 
I write for a college newspaper read by 
only about a hundred people. Second, 
these suggestions are not as economi
cally beneficial for the owners as 
they would prefer (meaning the 
greedy jag-offs wont get as much 
money as they possibly can). And 
third, the owners have been con
sidering hundreds of realign
ment plans for next season, 
when the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays and Arizona Diamond
backs join the league. Sev
eral of these plans have 
both the AL and NL be
coming two division 
leagues again, ending 
the three division and 
wild card systems 
altogether.
Now it is 1997. 
I am, plain and 
simple, a dumb col
lege kid. Im entering my 
senior year. I know how to 
drive, but I dont have a car. 
And I probably care more 
about watching cartoons 
than I do about finding a 
job. But baseball has three 
divisions in each league, which 
means more pennant races, 
more playoff games, and ulti
mately more enjoyment for 
us baseball fans.
Coox enjoys any and all 
comments on his column, 
responsible or otherwise. 
But if you do not like 
this column, Brian 
Hoffman will beat you 
up with a beer-soaked 
baseball and a bucket

said Joan Wlofe-Baxter, the first 
womens finisher in the first heat. It 
was really nice. Volunteers were won
derful, said Wlofe-Baxter, full-time 
mother of six and part-time assistant 
in her husbands dental office. The 
course was fun.
From the swim team, juniors 
Michelle Kondo and John Murray 
competed in each event, along with 
sophomore Mike Onofray and fresh
man Rob Gallagher. Sophomore 
Dave Atkinson, senior George 
Matcuk, and masters student Matt
tively for another team.
Its nice being a runner, I only have 
to do Flagstaff once, Yavorsky said 
before the race. The bikers gotta do 
that five times.
Murray held off Wlofe-Baxter and a 
sprinting Yavorsky at the finish.
The overall top finisher was fifthyear architect student Kirk Framke 
(please see related article, page L2). 
While the official sorted out the 
times, a raffle was held for all com
petitors. Prizes included a weekend 
at the Hampton Inn, luggage, and 
meals around town.
I couldn't do it without all the volunteers. 
 Donna Morosky, Triathlon organizer
Moe, all from the swim team, swam 
the 500 meter opening leg for their 
respective teams.
Dan put us together, said Moe, 
who was seeded second in the swim
ming portion.
I know Matt through Pioneers, 
said Dan Saffer, who did the running 
portion of the team. Cyclist Jeff Milton 
and Moe are former roommates and 
have competed on the swim team.
No, it didnt make me mad, said 
Moe, the UAA champion in the 500 
free, about being seeded second, in
stead of first. It just gave me more of 
a reason to work.
Just getting out and doing some
thing on a Sunday morning [made it 
fun], said Milton. He added that it 
was nice to see his teammates. It 
takes a triathlon to get us together. 
Atkinson and seniors Arthur 
Wojnarowski and Yavorsky made-up 
the swim, bike, and run legs respec
I couldnt do it without all the vol
unteers, saidMorosky. It takes about 
half as many volunteers as competi
tors to run the event.
City and CMU officers and EMS 
were paid for their presence and vol
unteers from the crew and swim 
teams, A Phi 0, and the cheerleading 
squad were instrumental to manag
ing the event. Seven staff members 
from the athletic department came 
out in full force to help us, said 
Morosky, mentioning Joan, Norma, 
Jan, Inez, Melody, Dave, and Big 
Mike by first names alone.
The goal of the triathlon ten years 
ago was to have something for the 
students to think about over the sum
mer for getting in shape. Morosky 
explained that this accounted for the 
CMU/non-CMU categories and vari
ous age groups.
It was real nice to come back, said 
Wlofe-Baxter.

DEFENSE, from page 12
we needed to step it up and I was in the 
right place at the right time.
After the interception and run-back, 
the Tartans had the ball on the Spar
tans 26-yard line. RB Neupaver rushed 
for 24 yards on four carries, the last 
three yards resulting in a touchdown.
It was a great win, Neupaver said. 
The offense and defense did a great 
job at the end. It was a great effort... 
well take it one week at a time.
The offensive unit was led by 
Neupaver and Campie, who finished 
with 55 and 50 yards, respectively. QB 
Clay completed 10 of 14 passes as he 
ended up with 128 yards, 74 of those 
yards going to TE Barnicle.
So how does it feel to finally have
defeated CWRU? Its good to finally 
beat them, Steiner said. We came 
out a little conservative, but the de
fense kept us in it. We did not worry: 
we knew what would work.
Our team showed a whole lot of 
character today, Coach Rich Lackner 
said. We are a young team, and I 
think our kids showed a lot of class, 
guts ... they grew up today.
Last Saturday was a great win for 
the Tartans. Although this game was 
not a blowout, like it was against 
Denison, it was a great win nonethe
less. The Tartans showed qualities 
that you cannot teach. They looked 
defeat dead in the eye and didnt 
blink. For the Tartans, CWRU now 
spells v-i-c-t-o-r-y.

the squad as they steamrolled 
;W&J in the first game. The

them. I didnt care. It was all 
worth it just to see Brittany pick 
up that huge spank from the 
middle, said Webb.
We gave away some stupid points, 
and thats because we're young.
 Julie Webb 
head volleyball coach
team was visibly very up about 
the win facing a team with a 
daunting serve and some very 
talented players.
I wore my shoulder out at pracDown 3-11 in the second game, 
sophomore setter Sarah Paturo 
served for a volley that put the 
Tartans within range of going 
ahead 12-11 by the time W&J
figured out how to slow the 
Tartans down. They narrowly lost 
that game, but lost it entirely in 
the third  a very quick game.
We gave away some stupid 
points, and thats because were 
young, said Webb.
In the entire match with W&J, 
the Tartans had 48 digs, about 12 
per game which showed consis
tency and definite improvement 
after last weekends disappoint
ing last place finish at the 
Marietta tournament.
We had a lot of fun out there 
and were really into the game. It 
feels different to play at home 
and having the fan support really 
helps, said Goede.

Burkett wasnt the only CMU 
staff member to earn a high rank 
as a black belt this summer. 
William Colon, a pipefitter for
in Akido, is one of the 35 mem
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
Akido Club. Its only a 2-3 hour 
commitment a week. Its a nice 
counterpoint to the intellectual

Scarpinatto. On similar grounds
Its a nice counterpoint to the intel

 Chris Scarpinatto, HCI Institute

vices, was awarded the rank of 
( second degree black belt in Tang 
^Soo Do by the C. S. Kim Karate 
College. He is a student and an 
instructor at C. S. Kim Karate 
in Monroeville.
Chris Scarpinatto, a first Kyu
as Burkett, Scarpinatto agrees 
that it has boosted her confi
dence in herself. More confident 
not more aggressive, she said.
The Akido club has been around 
for the last seven years and has 
also had members who were in 
some way physically disabled,
which shows how small a part 
physical ability plays.
Martial arts, however, can 
also be a grueling physical 
workout as well as a mental 
one. In martial arts its you 
who determines your goal. So 
whatever your objective may 
be, it never hurts to try. CMU 
has a number of clubs for vari
ous disciplines, such as the 
Shotokan Karate Club, the 
Akido Club and the Carnegie 
Mellon Tae kwon do Team. None 
of these require you to be physi
cally fit, and none require any 
previous experience, skill, or tal
ent. Mental stability helps 
though. If youve ever wondered 
what the flying fist of foo! was 
all about, now may be the time

Have you ever come out of a 
Jackie Chan movie saying How 
does he move so fast!? finished a 
Kung-Fu movie wondering where 
they got those Shaolin Monks 
from, or wondered how that fat, 
drunk man known as Master 
could fly? Okay, maybe not, but 
chances are you have thought of 
being a black belt, or considered 
trying out some discipline 
among the various forms of 
martial arts.
Early this summer, Susan 
Burkett, associate provost for re
search and academic administra
tion at CMU, was awarded the 
rank of third degree black belt by 
the American Tae kwon do Asso
ciation. She stood second in the 
womens sparring category dur
ing the 1993 World Tae kwon do 
Championship, and came back to 
become the World Champion in 
the category the next year.
Contrary to popular belief, most 
martial arts are not about being 
aggressive, fast, or even physi
cally strong. They are about self
defense, self discipline, and (most 
of all) self confidence.
Notice the word self being used 
here, as most martial arts, unlike 
team sports, depend entirely on 
the commitment of one person  
you. Success is not left in the 
hands of others. In fact success is 
not even defined! You decide for 
yourself what you like, and if you 
like what you 
did, youve al

The CMU womens volleyball 
team came out swinging at 
their double header Saturday 
at home, but lost two matches 
and ended the weekend with 
their record standing at 0-6.
The Tartans dropped the 
morning match to Hiram in 
straight games 3-15, 15-17, 
415. The second set was a 
classic duel as sophomore Beth 
Sekowski and freshman middle 
hitter Cindy Kos got in front 
and played superb at the net. 
At 5' 10", Kos had the height 
advantage that the Tartans 
needed against the taller 
Hiram squad.
Sophomore outside hitter 
Ashley Kinsey worked hard for 
each point, her knees and thighs 
covered in bruises by the end of 
the close game. The Tartans 
rallied from an early deficit, but 
Hiram found the holes in the 
court and shut the team down.
The afternoon brought on 
Washington and Jefferson Col
lege, who had trounced Hiram 
earlier that day. Kos and Kinsey 
continued the powerful attack, 
with Kinsey swinging for points. 
Freshman middle and outside 
hitter Jeri Goede got a lot of play
ing time in the match that CMU 
ended up losing in four sets, 15- 
12, 13-15, 2-15, 9-15.
Jeri did very well, said head 
coach Julie Webb about Goedes 
performance. Webb indicated 
that she was pleased with the 
Tartans showing against the 
tough W&J squad.
Defense won the game and 
kept us in there, she said.

Club gets crushed
By STACEY REED
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Everybody needs a little dust in their 
shorts once in a while. Following this 
advice, the CMU Baseball Club began 
their fall season Saturday afternoon 
with a double header at Mellon Park 
against Lockhaven Clearfield. Unfor
tunately, CMU was unable to find a 
win during the two 7-inning games, 
but fought a good fight, with scores of 
6-3 and 13-9. These were the first 
games in the CMU Baseball Clubs fall 
season, and the only games played on 
their home field.
Some new additions to the team are 
freshmen Takeo Mukai, Rico Chen, 
and Brian Wuen. Veterans include 
team captains Jay McCormack and 
John Zubiller. We played strong in 
both games, except for two innings. 
Take those two away, one from each 
game, and were talking one-run 
games, said Zubiller.
Showing considerable control on the 
field during the first game were 
Zubiller in center-field and pitcher 
Steven Wetter. Wetter pitched the first 
six-and-a-half innings of the day, then 
proceeded to take over the shortstop 
position when McCormack stepped up 
to the mound to finish the game. 
Wetters consistent fastball racked up 
six strikeouts during the first game. 
Zubiller was nearly flawless in his 
fielding, including a force-out at third 
in the Seventh inning.
The team was unable to show this 
control at the plate. The score was tied 
at 3-3 at the top of the seventh. 
Lockhaven Clearfield scored three 
runs at the top of the inning and CMU
responded with three strikeouts to 
end the game. Final score: 6-3.
Designated hitter and lead-off man 
Ramon Poo started off the second game 
with a triple, and the hitting on the 
whole continued to be strong. The 
base running also showed improve
ment. Jon Mayes, Brian Wuen, and 
John Zubiller all managed to steal 
one or more bases during the game.
The team had no problem getting on 
base; it was a matter of scoring. There 
were men left on base every inning. 
Only three runs scored during the first 
six innings, sending the team into the 
bottom of the seventh with a score of 
13-3. It was rally time. Six runs scored 
during their final at-bats, but not 
enough for the victory, as Lockhaven 
Clearfield walked away with both wins.
There were a lot of errors early in 
the second game and we dug too deep 
of a hole, said second-year coach Bob 
Janeda. We could have won, had we 
not gotten ourselves into so much 
trouble early on.
Playing for the first time as a team, 
communication seemed to be lacking 
on the field as the team seemed a bit 
uncomfortable during the first game. 
However, by the end of the second 
game, confidence was growing as the 
game became a team effort. Captain 
Jay McCormack was satisfied with 
the teams efforts. It was good to see 
a comeback in the second game, said 
McCormack. We didnt give up.
Coach Janeda feels very optimistic 
about the season and would be pleased 
if the team went .500. This is just a 
club sport and we beat a lot of teams 
who are varsity. Its a tribute to the 
guys, said Janeda.

Case Western Reserve University. For 
the past two years those four words have 
spelled d-o-o-m for the Tartans of CMU. 
In 1995, the Spartans of CWRU de
feated CMU 3-0, as they ended the 
Tartans streak of 224 games without
being shutout. In 1996, the Spartans 
beat CMU 16-0 in the second game of 
the season. However, this year tilings 
changed as CMU got revenge against 
CWRU 16-7.
The game started out slowly on Sat
urday as both teams were forced to 
punt on their first possessions. The 
game was being played methodically,
as each school tried to see what the 
other had in store. The Spartans re
sponded to the challenge on their sec
ond possession of the game. Spartans 
RB Ted Otero rushed for 24 yards dur
ing the series, while Spartan QB Nick 
Leskiewicz threw for 44 yards, as the 
Spartans moved the ball 90 yards in 11 
plays. The drive was capped off by a 27-
yard touchdown run by Leskiewicz 
on fourth down.
The crowd was stunned. Could the 
Tartans lose three years in a row? 
Would they actually be shut out again? 
As the Tartans stepped onto the field, 
all fears were put on hold as CMU 
went 66 yards in 11 plays. The drive 
ended with a 21-yard field goal kick by
20-yard completion. On second down 
and six to go on the Spartans 13, Clay 
threw a TD pass to Barnicle. The touch
down pass signified more than seven 
points, as it was the first time the Tar
tans had led against the Spartans in 
two years.
The defense of the Tartans came up 
big again this week as they shutout the

After a year off due to construction, 
CMUs 1997 Triathlon was a huge suc
cess. This was CMUs tenth triathlon.
The University Center had a lot to do 
with it, said event organizer Donna 
Morosky. The UCs central location led
where Forbes turns into Squirrel Hill 
and back down through Schenley. The 
bikers did this loop five times. The event 
was topped off with an approximate 5 K 
run. For the swimming portion, event

Remember Orientation Week for a 
moment: traveling sheeplike with your 
floor to activities, lectures, shows. They 
told you about sex, drugs, and college 
life. You knew where to go for health 
problems, you learned all the libraries, 
you remembered x8-2323 better than 
your own number. All fine and dandy, 
but no one told you about something 
crucial  eating.
Lets think about this a little. Are 
these food groups familiar  mac & 
cheese, Pizza Outlet, spaghetti, canned, 
and ramen/preservatives? Sure you 
know where to eat or whom to order
from, but theres an expensive budget 
attached to that. At some point, youve 
got to start cooking on your own, and 
roommates dont count.
Cooking isnt always easy. Ive seen 
food tragedies come and go, or come and 
stay for awhile smelling quite bad. Be
lieve me, Ive had my share of blunders. 
I was a latch-key-kid early on and even
tually I got tired of Oreos and peanut 
butter, so I braved the kitchen.
I learned some lessons quickly. See if 
any of these sound familiar. Whole eggs 
in the microwave do not come out hard 
boiled, but scrambled. Blue cheese is 
only called that if you bought it that 
way. Corollary: cheese has no merits as 
penicillin. Never put lettuce in the
freezer. In making caramel popcorn, do 
not directly add the caramel to the hot 
ail* popper. Black anything in general is 
bad. Crisco does not substitute for but
ter on veggies.
But not everyone comes to college with 
these experiences. Well, actually, a good 
number even have trouble with Duncan 
Hines brownie mix. And theres no cook
ing class at CMU. So heres a little some
thing to get you started. Call it the first 
day of College Cooking 101.
Staying up all night? Blend one cup 
each of coffee beans and milk, a Hershe/s 
chocolate bar, and a half cup. of sugar. 
Add a cup and a half of boiling water, 
blend again, then strain through a coffee 
filter. Tastes just like Starbucks, and
makes Jolt look like a condiment.
For a quick veggie Italian dish, mix a 
can each of white beans, chopped toma
toes, and chopped greens with some 
chopped onion, garlic and oregano, then 
microwave covered. Spread some butter 
and garlic salt on Italian bread, micro
wave, and youve got a meal.
Bagels are divine inspiration, espe
cially for food on the run. Theres the 
traditional pizza-style with cheese and 
tomato sauce. But how about hummus, 
cucumbers and cream cheese, or choco
late ... lots and lots of chocolate. For 
dessert of course.
Dont forget snacks. Melt a stick of 
butter and mix with a package of onion 
soup; pour over those big fat pretzels
and toss. Or toast some white bread with 
sliced tomatoes and feta cheese.
For the health-conscious, try these. 
Mix a one-pound bag of baby carrots 
with a wee pat of butter, some sugar, 
cinnamon, and a cup of water, then mi
crowave until tender. Mix cottage cheese 
and pineapples or pears, and serve over 
lettuce as a salad. For a great fat-free 
dessert, combine sliced ripe bananas, a 
small tub of fat-free Cool Whip, fat-free 
instant vanilla pudding, and a cup and a 
half of milk.
So there it is  a brief orientation to 
eating. Now run off and conquer the 
kitchen. You dont have to memorize 
Poison Controls number better than your 
own, but do keep the cleaner nearby.

Hwwc Feeding Freircy
City serves up 
spicy eateries
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Diversion Editor
Going out to eat is a bit of a 
sacred ritual for most of us. Maybe 
were too lazy to cook or maybe 
we just like to feel like we have 
some semblance of a social life, 
but whatever the reason, its gen
erally agreed upon that eating 
out is a good thing. For many, the 
only hard part about eating out is 
deciding where to go.
There are different categories 
of dining out  going out with 
the gang, going out on a date, and 
going out with the parents. Lets 
start with the most common, and 
sometimes most difficult, cat
egory  the friend scenario.
You have a group of friends 
together, and youre going out to 
eat. You all have different tastes 
and different budgets. Maybe one 
of your friends doesnt eat veg
etables, and another is a vegetar
ian. This calls for variety. Were 
talking smorgasbord here  lots 
of choices and little money.
Five out of the five random 
people I asked to name the place 
they frequent most often with 
their friends chose Mad Mex in 
Oakland. One guy whom we shall 
leave unnamed really meant 
Cozumel - he got confused be
tween the Mexican eateries. Any
how, Mad Mex, with its loud 
music, isnt a good place for con
versation, but it does offer some 
fine eats. And of course, with half 
price food after 11 pm, even the 
tightwad in your group will want 
to chow down on a burrito.
If you are more worried about 
price than the quality of cui
sine, Ritters Diner is the place 
for you and your friends. Cheap 
and greasy is the way they 
serve everything at this Baum 
Avenue eatery. Scrambled eggs 
with a banana split for dessert
 yummy.
The next category is a little 
more troublesome. Most people 
have friends, but how many 
people at this University have 
actually been out on a date? In 
place of the expert opinions of the 
mack daddies on campus, I will 
offer my humble opinion of places 
that would make great date spots.
First, lets look at the ingredi
ents that go into a hot date locale
 low lighting, an appropriate 
noise level (one you can speak 
over), maybe some candles, some 
wine, and a decor that can be
tallted about when conversation 
screeches to a halt.
Its been a while since Ive been 
out on a date, but Kay a in the 
Strip District would make for a 
most smoochable date. The inti
mate Caribbean atmosphere will 
cause your date to snuggle up 
close to you. The weird stuff on 
the menu and the walls makes 
for excellent conversation. Not 
too expensive, around 20 bucks 
a person, Kaya could be the way 
to go.
Thinking of something a little 
cheaper and a bit closer to cam
pus? I suggest one of my personal 
favorites, Spice Island Tea House 
on Atwood Street. It looks a little 
dingy from the outside, but in
side its cozy, quiet, and eclectic. 
Once again, you can spend quite 
a bit of time talking about all 
those things you cant pronounce 
on the menu and examining the 
Buddha fruit shrine. The Thai/ 
Malaysian/Chinese/Burmese 
food may leave your breath kind 
of stinky, so be sure to bring 
some gum.
Of course for you big-spenders, 
Pittsburgh has a few restaurants 
that might break the bank, but 
are sure to impress that special 
someone. Pasta Piatto 
(Shadyside), Grand Concourse 
(Station Square), Top of the Tri
angle (Downtown), and Ruths 
Chris Steak House (Downtown) 
are some of the citys most expen
sive eateries. Id tell you more 
about them, but no one has ever 
taken me there (hint, hint).
Its kind of funny, but the pa
rental genre of restaurants over
laps that of the date restaurants. 
I think it goes along with the 
idea of someone else paying for 
your meal. So any of the date 
restaurants would be appropri
ate for the folks, as long as you 
arent paying.
In my experience, parents seem 
to like The Balcony in Shadyside. 
Theres good food, jazz, and a 
view of Walnut Street. The Sun
day brunch is a good bet with 
mom or dad. Were talkingtons of 
food and a noise level appropri
ate for pops sensitive ears. Some 
nights for dinner they have the 
all-you-can-eat lobster thing  
good deal, if you like lobster.
If all else fails, eat at Union 
Grill on Craig Street. Its close. 
Its good. Friends, dates, and 
parents all like it. Its a real 
crowd pleaser.

Writer delivers pizza advice.(C
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Assistant Forum Editor
Pizza ... you know you love it. This deliciously 
cheesy, temptingly greasy food is a college 
standby. Its cheap, its tasty, and itll arrive at 
your door whenever you want it without your 
needing to do much more than pick up the 
phone. It makes fun times that much more fun 
and adds excitement to even the most gruel
ing late-night study sessions.
Lucky for us, Pittsburgh is crawling with 
pizzerias. Yet its nearly impossible for 
most people, armed only with stacks of 
delivery menus, to figure out which places 
have good pizza and which feature card
board topped with that white rubbery 
stuff you use to stick posters up i 
your room. So heres a guide to some 
of the most popular pizza delivery 
places near the CMU campus.
Happy eating!
Larry and Carols pizza is pure 
Italian heaven. Its crust is crispy 
and chewy and tastes like a loaf of 
freshly-baked bread. Id be perfectly 
satisfied if, for some reason, Larry and 
Carols decided to sell only rounds of crust 
from now on, without bothering to put 
anything on top.
Since they dont, its even better. We get to 
experience not only this yummy crust but deli
ciously tangy tomato sauce and cheese that 
tastes like real cheese. Some pizza cheeses taste 
like melted plastic, but with Larry and Carols 
pizza, you can tell beyond a doubt that they melted 
actual mozzarella cheese. Not only that, but its prob
ably high-quality mozzarella. Theyre even nice enough 
to stick some kind of hard candy in the box with your 
pizza. I think its a well-meaning attempt to ward off 
any post-dinner bad breath.
The pizza at Pizza Perfecta is also pretty close to 
perfect. The crust is a little spongier than Larry and 
Carols, but equally good. The tomato sauce is quite spicy 
and tomato-ish  you can tell that its homemade.
Pizza Perfecta heaps a little too much cheese on its 
pizzas for my taste, but since its genuine cheese, not 
Plasti-Tak, this doesnt result in tragedy.
For those occasions when you decide you want to eat 
something that cant be dumped on a round crust and 
baked, Pizza Perfecta offers a full selection of foods that 
arent pizza. Especially good are their linguini marinara 
and Greek salad. This salad, like the pizza, is packed full 
of cheese, so dont be surprised to find a mini-avalanche 
of feta when you open the Styrofoam container.
Papa Johns Pizza is easier on the budget than either of 
these places. Its pizzas are, predictably, less memorable, 
although they still can make a decent late-night meal. 
The cheese and sauce and everything are all there, and 
its not noticeably greasy or disgusting. Ask for their thin 
crust pizza, because its much better than the deep-dish 
version. The main reason to get Papa Johns isnt its pizza 
at all, but the garlic dipping sauce that comes with it. This 
sauce transforms whatever you put into it into instant 
garlic bread.
Pizza Outlet cant even pass the grease testyoull probably ,j 
need a paper towel to soak up the grease before attempting to : 
eat the pizza  but it takes DineXpress, which covers a

A large number of CMU students gave 
up their afternoon last Saturday to re
turn to campus in hopes of being able to 
make a difference by getting involved 
and getting others involved.
I hope the day will get people to real
ize that social activism is really impor
tant and that their contribution can do a 
lot of good. There are a lot of little things 
that can be done that can do a great deal 
for this campus and community, said 
Janel Hanmer, a junior chemistry and 
technical writing major.
Students representing AB Lectures, 
AB Political Speakers, Amnesty Inter
national, Advocaids, Building Blocks, 
Circle K, cmuOUT, CMU Vegetarians, 
Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice, 
Earth, Food Not Bombs, Free Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, Pugwash, and the CMU 
Womens Center convened at the Uni
versity Center to host the first ever Do 
Something Day.
In April 1997, the CMU chapter of 
Amnesty International received a grant 
from the national offices. Instead of 
joining with one or two other groups 
for a project, the students had a differ
ent idea: They decided to join with 
other campus groups to hold a confer
ence to get more people involved in all 
the groups.
Everyone thinks this campus is very 
apathetic, and I dont think thats true. 
It takes an event like this to bring out
people who really care, said Debby 
Keller, a junior art, biology, and psy
chology major, and a group coordinator 
of Amnesty International.
Many students feel its pointless to 
try to start to do anything and dont feel 
that joining groups accomplishes any
thing. I hope they come out of this 
day thinking T can make a differ
ence and that they know they can 
make a big difference just by doing 
something small and opening their 
mind to new things, said Melissa 
Chan, a junior chemical engineer
ing and engineering and public 
policy major, and a group coordina
tor of Amnesty International.
Throughout the afternoon, the dif
ferent groups held workshops ad
dressing how students can get in
volved in the fight for human rights, 
rape prevention, recycling, and other 
causes. In addition to delivering the 
keynote address, Paul Rogat Loeb, 
an investigative reporter and au
thor of the book Generation at the ... _ ,
Crossroads: Apathy and Action on 0 0me ,n^ 
the American Campus, hosted two work
shops. Loeb focused his talks on such 
areas as how to get involved on your 
campus and how to get others involved 
as well.
Youhave to think about whatthe struc
ture of the school is, and figure out how 
you can use that to support activism.... We 
used to think that if we only got people the 
facts, then theyd be able to act. Now we 
feel everybody lies to us and our leaders
are all corrupt. We have to convince people 
to care and that our actions matter. I think 
thats harder to do. We have to restore 
peoples faith, said Loeb.
The leaders of the group hope that Do 
Something Day will become an annual 
event at CMU. [We hope it will] keep
people at CMU who do care but they just 
need to be convinced that these issues 
are important and definitely worth dedi
cating their time to, said Thomas.
Over 120 students registered for Do 
Something Day in advance, and circu
lated through the different workshops

Around CMU, youll find budding nov
elists, entrepreneurs, All-Americans 
(both athletic and scholastic), and even a 
Nobel Prize winner. Whos the latest credit 
to add to this list? How about U.S. Na
tionals Triathlon team qualifier Kirk 
Framke, a fifth-year architecture major.
Framke earned a spot on the team and 
the right to help represent the U.S. at the 
World Championships in Australia No
vember 16, by virtue of his 12th place 
finish in the 20-24 age group. Framke 
finished 51st overall in the Columbia 
Triathlon, held August 17.
Whats a good time for National quali
fier? According to Framke, his 2:05:14 
time was a little slow for him. The typical 
Triathlon covers a 1.5 kilometer swim, 
followed by a 40 K bike, and topped off 
with a 10 K run.
Framke, at 511 and 140 lbs., is very 
slender in stature. Because of his size, he 
is often viewed as the underdog in 
triathlon circles. His physical build is 
more suited to long-distance running 
rather than competitive triathlons. 
Triathletes generally adhere to two dis
tinct body types: Framkes, or the tall 
and lean with a lot more muscle [type].
Actually, Framke has tried several dif
ferent sports, and found that he excelled 
in most of them, despite his size. For 
CMU, Framke has run cross-country, 
played two years of rugby, and a season of
Framke completed the 2.09 K swim in 
22:54 and the 42 K bike in 1:02:46. To 
finish, he chased down the bigger competi
tors with a time of 39:34 over the 10 K 
Framke traveled to Naples, Florida 
last winter specifically to train.
Naples was beautiful, said Framke. I 
ran into a biking group that had pro rid
ers. Framke is strong in all three legs of 
the race. But thanks to his recent training, 
biking is definitely my strongest. 
Framkes sponsors include Nutrition 
for Life and Glavic Saturn of Woodcliff. 
Some corporate sponsors, such as Polar 
Electronics and Head Wheels, have of
fered him equipment at cost. Framke is 
looking for sponsors, and new equipment 
would be welcome. At this point I need a 
new bike frame, said Framke.
What does a triathlete set to represent 
the U.S. eat?
I eat constantly, said Framke. Tve 
had problems being underweight. His 
diet is pretty much what youd expect for 
a world class athlete: pasta, produce, ce
real, and not much junk food or fast food.
Td like to race professionally, said 
Framke. The professional tour runs all 
over the world, through nations such as 
Japan, Malaysia, Brazil, and Australia. 
The typical take for the winner of such 
contests is between $3,000 and $6,000.
For now it seems Framke will have to be 
satisfied with a trip to Australia, winning 
CMUs Triathlon [Ed. Note: please see re
lated story, page 12], and adding his name 
to the growing list of Carnegie Meliorates.

Fifth-year architect Eric Framke has made a name for himself in triathlons.
football. He also ran a marathon in Phila
delphia last year. Football was the only 
sport Framke found he couldnt excel at. 
Theres not much room for a 140-lbs widereceiver. Go figure, he .said.
Withhis varying athletic skills in mind, 
competitive triathlons, which consists of 
three different sports, seem appropriate 
for Framke. Im going to Australia, so I 
guess I cant complain, said Framke. 
The Columbian [course] is the toughest
there is. Its straight up and straight 
down the whole time. According to 
Framke, the course has three big as
cents, ranging from one to two miles 
each. One such climb is steeper than 
Forbes Avenue going to Squirrel Hill. 
The course didnt tail off from there.
The rest of the course is severely roll
ing hills, said Framke.
The swimming and biking portions were 
stretched a little at the preliminary races.

Im the best professor of art and 
robotics in the world. As far as I 
know, theres not another one.
Simon Penny holds the un
usual title of associate professor 
of art and robotics at CMU. An 
artist, writer, theorist, and 
teacher, Penny was eager to 
share his enthusiasum about art 
and robotics last Thursday as a 
guest lecturer for the College of 
Fine Arts. Theres nothing I like 
more than spending an hour talk
ing about me, said Penny.
A native of Australia, Penny 
earned his degrees from the 
South Australian Schools of Art 
and Sydney College of the Arts.
He trained as a sculptor and 
came to CMU in 1989 after re
ceiving an invitation from Bryan Penny 
Rogers, head of the Art Department at 
CMU. My engagement with electron
ics and digital technology has been 
gradual over 15 years, said Penny.
Using robotics and computer tech
nology in his artistic works, Penny 
attempts to unearth the mysteries be
hind the aesthetics of behavior. Penny 
uses his knowledge of kinesthetics, 
the study of body movement, and the 
somatosenses in studyinghuman-computer interaction. Artistic practice to 
me is the practice of manipulation of 
sensory variables. Artwork is some
thing that is amenable directly to the 
senses, said Penny.
Working with electronic tools pro
duces a kind of tension, a tension be
tween the sculptural, tangible, ame
nable directly to the senses with the 
abstract world of the virtual, said 
Penny. A parallel tension, according 
to Penny, is felt between individualis
tic and independent artists that must 
collaborate with engineers and techni
cians. The concept of working with 
experts or even collaborators, at least 
until recently, has been rather uncom
fortable in the art world. Penny, how
ever, relies heavily on collaboration to 
create his highly technical works.
Pennys unique creations capture the 
nature of an object and provide a func
tion in society. He refers to this as the 
duality of poetics and criticality. Of 
course I believe that in order to make 
successful artwork one must combine 
a poetics of that which is immediately 
experienced by the viewer with some 
effective way of actually discussing 
issues, said Penny.
Pennys most acclaimed project, Petit
Lisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
s artistic work stems from technology.
Mai, combines sonar and pyro-electric 
sensors to navigate within surround
ings. During the lecture, Penny showed 
a video of the impressive robot with two 
large wheels on each side of a swinging 
pendulum. Sensors allow the robot to 
monitor and react to activity within an 
environment. When a person moves, the 
robot reacts by moving closer or further 
away. Pennys creation promotes inter
action and social behavior between man 
and machine. Experts estimated that 
the complex machinery would cost 
$50,000. Penny, collaborating with CMU 
students, managed to create the project 
for only $5000 by using materials from 
dumpsters and surplus catalogs.
Recently, Penny has returned from a 
residency in Karlsruhe, Germany, at 
the Center for Art and Media Technol
ogy where he completed Fugitive, an 
interactive video installation. Zoe 
Woodworth, junior art major, said, It 
seems the more work he does, it gets 
more abstract and conceptual. Fugi
tive is at the point where there is no 
real art work. There is no central art 
object. Itsjustareallyinterestingidea.
For Pennys current project he will 
build six social robots, similar to Petit 
Mai. The robots, equipped with the 
ability to speak, will interact with 
people and each other. Penny wants 
the robots to communicate but still 
maintain autonomy and individuality. 
Im very keen to ensure some kind of 
emergent sociality, said Penny.
His body of work is interesting to 
look at over the time line. He sets a 
really good role model for artists like 
me that dont use traditional medi
ums, said Woodworth.

As it stands, the only thing more 
stressful than life at CMU is being 
disabled and jobless. So how do stu
dents divvy up their time to tackle the 
immense amounts of school work they 
face? They sleep.
Or so it seems, according to a Center 
for Innovative Learning (CIL) study 
that tracked how CMU students spend 
their time in any given 24-hour period. 
Using beepers and questionnaires, re
searchers and professors of Psychology 
Kenneth Kotovsky and Edward Hayes, 
director of CIL, prompted first- and 
third-year students to report what they 
were doing at random intervals within 
two hour blocks for one week.
Students who participated in the study 
were asked to fill out a questionaire 
every time they were beeped to record 
their activities at various times during 
the day. Participants were paid $25 for 
the week.
The breakdown of how students 
spend their day is a little different 
than what most might expect. Students 
fill their time with the following activi
ties in the following order: sleeping, 
entertainment, studying, life support 
(eating, bathing, doing laundry), and 
working at non-academic jobs.
The results indicate different pat
terns of activity for freshmen and jun
iors and for students in the various 
colleges. Little evidence was found to 
suggest that the average student is 
overworked.
But before they tried to map out a 
typical day of a CMU student, Kotovsky 
and Hayes wanted to know what moti
vates how students plan their agenda. 
The running myth is that CMU is a
tension-ridden ------------------------------
place, but are we 
really more in
tense than other 
schools? Judg
ing by initial 
stress level sur
veys, students 
here live in con
stant anxiety. ___________________
While students might not actually put in a lot of 
hours of work, they always have a lot of 
work to do, said Kotovsky. The work 
never goes away. [Students] often say 
they wish they had 9-5 jobs  they 
want to compartmentalize the work, 
he said.
On average, students sleep 8.9 
hours, but the maximum of 14.4 and 
minimum of 3.8 show that students 
might sleep adequately, but not 
efficiently.
Its a binge and purge cycle, said Ivor 
Clarke, a junior information systems,

to. On average, students from CIT 
devote the most amount of hours to 
academic-related work and students 
from the School of Computer Science 
spend the least amount of time doing 
homework  roughly 5.25 hours. 
H&SS students attend class less ofFrench and human/computer interac
tion major. We work for three days 
straight then sleep for three days

Most students shouldnt find the re
sults of the study to be surprising, said 
Clarke. It all goes along with the work

The ratio of sleep to work is also age the working day in class, according to
the survey.
But most of 
these results 
have to do with 
the nature of 
the programs of 
study, said 
Kotovsky. And

create compariPart of the problem lies In the culture on cam

then stress levels would probably decrease.

appropriate, said Kotovsky.
But the unbalanced sleep pattern is 
probably also contributing to notions 
of stress, said Hayes.
However, they were not looking for 
statistical significance to rationalize 
the amount of work CMU students are 
expected to do. The point was to char
acterize the way students in general 
spend their time to help them evaluate 
their management skills.
The results of the study also indi
cated that student schedules vary de
pending on which college they belong
sons between colleges, he said.
Part of the problem lies in the culture 
on campus, Kotovosky said. People 
talk about how hard it is and so the 
mentality grows. If students redesign 
their expectations then stress levels 
would probably decrease.
The study was part of the CILs Fall 
1997 Seminar Series on Education 
which met for the first time this semes
ter last Friday. The next lecture will 
take place on September 26 in the 
Connan Room.

In the employment world, the 
work force is changing so rapidly 
... people need to take charge of 
their careers, said Buddy Hobart, 
a 1981 Humanities and Social 
Science (H&SS) alumnus.of CMU 
and the president of the Pitts
burgh-based company, Solutions 
21. Hobart was just one of the 
presenters at the first annual 
Graduate Student Career Day, 
Thinking Ahead  A Profes
sional Development Seminar for 
Graduate Students, which took 
place last Saturday in the Uni
versity Center.
Sessions covered things such 
as how to present oneself, write 
resumes and cover letters, make 
effective verbal presentations, 
and deal with personal problems. 
Hosted by Anne Shields, director 
of the Career Center, and Bar
bara Lazarus, associate provost 
for academic projects, a questionand-answer session was offered 
where students could submit per
sonal questions about problems 
they may encounter or have al
ready encountered as graduate 
students and as prospective em
ployees, such as relocating part
ners, informing people of preg
nancy, and suffering chronic 
medical problems.
The event was sponsored by 
the Career Center, the Office of 
the Associate Provost for Aca
demic Projects, the Office of Stu
dent Affairs, and the Graduate 
Student Assembly. These three 
key offices have worked inde
pendently for the past several 
years trying to focus on the is
sues that graduate students are 
facing, said Shields. This year, 
they decided to work together to 
make it more convenient and co
herent for the students.
The Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA) offered student input on plan
ning the career day by working 
closely with the administration.
The graduate students here 
are among the best throughout 
the world undoubtedly, and we 
get an opportunity to work with 
outstanding faculty in one of the 
finest research environments that 
a university can offer, said Jay 
Shankavaram, doctoral student 
in the Architecture Department 
and the president of the Gradu
ate Student Assembly. This puts 
us in an enviable position with a 
unique and highly desirable set 
of skills, so it is important that 
we get an opportunity to identify 
the options available to us and 
make the right decisions for the 
future, said Shankavaram.
Nearly 160 students partici
pated in the event, which focused 
on three major areas that gradu
ate students today need to think 
about in order to adequately pre
pare for the future job search
ing, enhancing their professional 
qualifications, and presenting 
themselves to employers. Weve 
had a lot of interest from stu
dents but also a lot of support, 
said Lazarus.
Nine different sessions were of
fered throughout the day, pre
sented by CMU faculty members, 
administrators, and alumni.
Job searching sessions focused 
on getting a job in academic ad
ministration, in industry and gov
ernment, and also in starting a 
personal business. Most infor
mation we get is about teaching 
and research positions, and this 
session provided a larger over
view of academic jobs in a univer
sity setting, said Laurie 
Levesque, a GSIA doctoral stu
dent, after attending a seminar 
entitled, Academic Administra
tion: Other Jobs in the Academy.
We understand that students 
have different goals, and we de
signed [the career day] with that 
in mind, said Shields.
Sessions related to strengthen
ing professional qualifications 
focused on topics such as net
working and getting published. 
In his lecture, Hobart stressed 
that it is critical to have a base of 
people who know your skills in 
order to be able to become a mar
ketable resource in the employ
ment world. People do not have 
enough time, and people are in 
need of knowledge, said Hobart.
[Hobart] helped us to realize 
what is important to a potential 
employer, and from that, how to 
get that persons attention during 
the job search, said Amy Bonsall, 
a masters student in electrical 
and computer engineering.
We hope this will be the begin
ning of many new partnerships 
which address the broad profes
sional development needs of gradu
ate students, said Lazarus. tfWe 
look forward to learning from [the 
program] and developing more tar
geted programs in the future.

Mixed media exhibit 
twists gender roles
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Features Editor
Look at a Calvin Klein advertise
ment. What do you see? A bunch of 
young women and men dressed fairly 
similarly. In fact, some of them even 
look similar. There are men and 
women with long hair, men and 
women with the same clothes, men 
and women with the same body shape. 
In some instances, its difficult to spot 
which are the men and which are the 
women. Maybe its not impossible, 
but its certainly more difficult than if 
someone handed you a picture of 
Marilyn Monroe and Marlon Brando 
and asked, Which one is the man?
The current gender-bending trend 
in advertising is a direct descendant 
of a movement in the photography 
and art world that has been going on
Manet painting as well as the scandal 
surrounding it. For just as Manet 
placed a prostitute in the role of Ve
nus, Morimura has placed a man in 
the role of the prostitute. It is a tri
umph in the deliberate portrayal of a 
supposedly gender-specific role as well 
as a thumbed-nose at social commen
tary and the world of art criticism.
Another side of the collection is a set 
of three mixed media collages from 
199ls The Body Series by Christian 
Marclay. These works consist of al
bum covers sewn together with thick 
white thread to form alternate pic
tures. One of the most interesting is 
Magnetic Fields, a successful com
position that is uncannily seamless, 
combining different hair, eyes and 
facial features to produce one strik
ing, concrete image of the overwhelm
ing similarity of people. Also included
It is a triumph in the deliberate portrayal 
of a supposedly gender-specific role as 
well as a thumbed-nose at social commentary and the world of art criticism. 
since the early 20s. The roots of this 
movement are currently on display 
at the Andy Warhol Museum in an 
exhibition entitled Rrose is a Rrose 
is a Rrose: Gender Performance in 
Photography and in a touching trib
ute to Warhols friend, Candy Dar
ling, Always a Lady.
The installation of Rrose is a Rrose 
is a Rrose: Gender Performance in 
Photography is an impressive col
lection of works from the early 20s to 
the present that entertains the ques
tion of gender identity. Included in 
the collection are Man Ray, Robert 
Mapplethorpe, Nan Goldin and more. 
Each piece is interesting when viewed 
individually, but the real power be
hind the exhibition is in the display 
and variation in themes and years.
The collection starts out with 
L.H.O.O.Q, a 1919 photograph by 
Marcel Duchamp which depicts the 
Mona Lisa with a convincing mus
tache and beard. It is a small photo
graph in format but not in connota
tion. It takes a fairly unquestioned 
icon of female beauty and mystery 
and transforms it into a playfully 
masculine image. It is the perfect 
puzzling and intriguing beginning to 
an extremely thought-provoking col
lection which sheds light on gender 
and culture as we know it today.
The highlight of the collection is a 
large color photograph withbrushedon varnish. It has been positioned so 
that it is the first piece one encoun
ters upon looking into the room, and 
rightly so. It is a reproduction of 
Manets Olympia, a highly contro
versial painting that, at the time of 
its unveiling, was said to be a mock
ery ofTitians Venus. Manets paint
ing is of a nude woman, commonly 
believed to be a prostitute, reclining, 
on a divan, a cat at her feet, and her 
servant bringing her flowers. The 
mimic of Manet currently on display 
at the Warhol, Portrait (Futago), a 
1988 photograph by Yasumasa 
Morimura, plays off the original
in this series is David Bowie, a 
kitschy representation of the rocker 
as a hot-pants-wearing, garter-beltsporting (possible) female. Its an im
age that Warhol himself would have 
loved, and is a great reflection of the 
humor in this installation.
Next door to A Rrose is a Rrose is a 
Rrose is an exhibit entitled Candy 
Darling, Always a Lady. Candy Dar
ling, born James Slattery, was a con
stant figure in the Factory scene and 
a successful actress. The moving trib
ute to her now on display includes a 
range of photographs and memora
bilia from her youth, her years as an  
actress in Warhols films, and touch
ing images of her before her death. 
The collection begins with a photo 
booth strip of a young James Slattery 
looking like a typical American boy in 
two frames, but in the third he has 
donned a blonde wig in what seems to 
be humble homage to his favorite 40s 
movie actresses. From this first im
age of Candy Darling to the last, the 
viewer gets a privileged glimpse into 
one of the most interesting characters 
in Warhols scene and an emotional 
journey through her life.
By combining these two exhibits, 
the Andy Warhol Museum provides 
the viewer with everything art should 
be on just one floor. The pieces are 
intriguing, heart-wrenching, enlight
ening, humorous, serious, explana
tory, and frequently, brilliant. The 
installation is a glimpse into the his
tory of gender representations in art 
and how that history is affecting our 
everyday lives and culture. And its a 
precursor to the future and the prom
ise of puzzling, innovative, mixed-up 
to the point of straight-up represen
tations. Its enough to make your 
head spin wondering if reality re
ally exists or if everything is an illu
sion  all things Andy would have 
wanted people to consider.
The exhibits will be on display from 
September 14 through November 30.
Iranian films play at Carnegie
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Recently, the world has taken notice 
of the film movement in Iran. As 
cinemas great voices leave us, we are 
left with derivative dreck. The other 
day, somebody referred to Joel 
Shumacher as an auteur. In this apocatyptic situation Iran has emerged as 
an important source for some of con
temporary cinemas leading talents.
Irans auteurs 
Makhmalbaf, Kiarostami,
Mehrjui  are sometimes 
accused of reinventing 
neorealism, but behind 
their films, a rare complex
ity of subject and narrative 
is apparent.
Behind the downplayed 
political conscience of their 
films lies a deep love of film 
fed by the modem traditions 
of auteur cinema. In fact, 
these filmmakers are criti
cized under the argument 
that they ignore Iranian 
subjects and pander to 
Western tastes. For any
one who has watched their 
films, this argument seems 
indeed perplexing; Iranian 
films are unlike any offer
ing of European cinema, 
not only in subject but in 
realization.
There is also the fact that 
unless you live in a cosmo
politan mecca, youre un
likely to see an Iranian 
film. However, museums and film societ
ies across the country have recently be
gun to show series and retrospectives. 
The Carnegie Museum of Art is one of 
them, and through this and the next 
month, we will enjoy a representative 
sample of Iranian movies.
Iranian filmmakers frequently use 
non-professional actors and shoot un
scripted scenes. This style of fully fic
tional documentaries has been popular
ized most notably by Abbas Kiarostami
in his trilogy culminating with Through 
the Olive Trees, a film set on the set of a 
film that was about another film made 
and released years before. Thus we have 
not only the story of the film, but also a 
playful Russian doll trick that examines 
the nature of cinematic storytelling.
However, Kiarostamis primary con
cern is showing the little things: mo
ments that make up the lives of his 
characters. This minimalist approach 
reaches in and shows the universal hu. CBN film distributors

man in the local and we realize that the 
life of a bricklayer in a small Iranian 
town can deeply parallel our own.
This pattern of looking at society while 
examining the essence of storytelling is 
also present in some of the films of 
Mohsen Makhmalbaf. His most recent 
film, Gdbbeh, presents a simple story 
with merging timelines and characters 
with an abandon that David Lynch 
wishes he had. At the . same time, 
Makhmalbaf is turning from an overt
homage to cinemas history (underly
ing in films like The Actor and Salaam 
Cinema) to an adoption of Persian nar
rative traditions.
Even when approaching subjects as 
innocuous as the life of nomadic crafts
men in Iran, Makhmalbaf and others 
are plagued by censorship recrimina
tions. One could argue that this crisis
like climate (which includes funding 
problems) contributes to the quality of 
the Iranian cinema coming out now.
Makhmalbaf rightfully 
agrees; his next film will 
be made in India.
Among Irans social ex
aminers is also Darius 
Mehrjui, who recently has 
been doing a series on 
womens role in Iranian so
ciety. The reexamination 
of roles and values is ap
parent in his film Sara, an 
adaptation of Ibsens A 
Dolls House set in modem 
Iran. The films of this Ira
nian movement are ulti
mately about decency and 
tolerance, not only toler
ance among cultures (as in 
From Karkheh to Rhine) but 
also tolerance of each other 
and our flaws.
Iranian filmmakers are 
becoming festival dar
lings. Kiarostamis latest, 
The Taste of Cherries, won 
the Palme dOr this sum
mer. Hopefully this will 
result in wider exposure 
and distribution of this in
ternationally relevant national cinema.
The Iranian film series continues with 
Shadow of Imagination on September 19, 
20; The Actor on Septemeber 26,27; From 
Karkheh to Rhine on October 3,4; Sara on 
October 10,11; The Jar on October 17,18; 
Through the Olive Trees on October 24,25 
and The White Balloon on October 31 and

Hardcore band brings in the funk
By STEPHEN BIDWA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Groove-core. Slam music. Funk metal. 
How many word combinations are float
ing around out there to describe aggres
sive yet musically interesting bands 
styles? Well, Flambookey has embarked 
on a course to increase the number of 
said terms by one.
I Who: Flambookey 
What: Flambookey 
I Company: F.A.D.
The four-piece band consists of W. 
Peter Owens (vocals), Johnny B. 
(bass), Joseph M. Cade, Jr. (percus
sion), and Michael Stick Shefrin (gui
tars). The order of this listing of per
sonnel pretty much sums up the im
portance that each instrument gar
ners in the production of the bands 
self-titled debut album, with bass and 
drums switching places.
Owenss voice is at the forefront in 
each song, whether he is shouting 
the words or softly growling them. 
Some smooth use of the voice box 
throughout the album is noticeable 
and appreciated.
Cades drumming is better than 
solid, showcasing the talent of a band 
position that too often is filled by medio
cre, simplistic talent. Cade is not con
tent to use a simple 4/4 beat, with kick 
drum on one and three and an occa
sional heavy-metal double bass section 
thrown in for fun. His drummingis funkflavored, and more interesting to hear. 
When you are listening to a song, you 
can actually focus on the drumming and 
not turn into a vegetable.
The bass solo on track 12 proves that 
Johnny B.s got skill, but the album 
doesnt showcase this skill nearly enough 
throughout the other 11 tracks.
The same complaint applies to the 
guitar work on the album. Sticks play
ing is solid, and shows that he is no hack, 
but the guitar intricacies that make Rage 
Against the Machine so cool to listen to 
are absent in Flambookeys work.
Its a shame because their method of 
delivery could really benefit from some 
jaw-dropping guitar sections. Not all the 
time, mind you. Its what the Chili Pep
pers have in their bassist, Flea. If Stick 
would let rip with a 10-second blast 
every now and then during a song, this 
album would tear the roof down.
But it doesnt. In previous press cover
age of the band, a writer described the 
bands style as a lesson in groove-core and 
how one can aggressively rock out, while 
still delivering lyrics that are sung instead 
of screamed. Yo, whats wrong with scream
ing in a hardcore, emotional music scene? 
Im not saying go to the extreme of, like, 
Napalm Death, where you cant under
stand a damn word from the get go, but 
screaming is not a bad thing. Owens could 
scream a lot more on this album.
And he needs to drop the bad 80s rap 
delivery. It brought down the Chili Pep
pers otherwise good early music, and it 
hurts Flambookeys debut. Owens 
sounds good in his higher pitches as 
well, but he continually drops back down 
and starts singing, not screaming.
Flambookey hooks your attention at 
the start with most of their songs. The 
problems arise as most of the songs 
continue. They seem to lose the inten
sity that smacks you at the beginning, 
petering out into vacuousness. More 
rhythm switches and intricate guitar 
and bass parts would throw these songs 
up to the next level, but now they re
main on the first floor. Dont be espe
cially surprised if you catch yourself 
contemplating your navel while listen
ing to this album.
New Works Festival presents second week of one-act plays
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The second week of the Pitts
burgh New Works Festival fea
tured an eclectic mix of one-acts. 
The first of the evening, Sar
cophagus by Scott C. Sickles, is a 
refined and moving piece about a 
young would-be actor and an old 
over-the-hill actress who meet in 
a secluded room of a Hollywood 
mansion during a masquerade 
ball. He is dressed as Robin Hood, 
she as Cleopatra.
They talk about making it in 
Hollywood, being chewed up and 
spit out by Hollywood, and how to 
schmooze with people you hate 
and why you have to do it. In 
doing so, they find common
ground and form a bond  they 
do not fall in love, thank God. 
Sickless play becomes sentimen
tal only when the time is right 
and he doesnt over-do it.
The acting is less reliable. Both 
Matthew Calvetti and Phyl 
Charnes are good enough actors, 
but neither ever seems to forget 
that they are on stage, and thus, 
neither does the audience. Ges
tures and movements seem just 
slightly choreographed, slightly 
rehearsed. Luckily, they do no 
damage to Sickless lovely and 
memorable script, which stands 
out as the best script in the first 
half of the New Works Festival.
The second play, Asking for 
Roses by William Cameron, is a 
tedious, bumbling melodrama
about a husband and wife whose 
relationship is being ruined by 
her despondence over her in
ability to have a second child, 
and her worry that they might 
lose the five-year-old boy they 
already have.
She nags her husbandwho is 
very caught up in work and nab
bing a certain account  about 
what they can do to have another 
child, and it bothers him.
They grow farther and far
ther apart from each other un
til the end when they find com
mon ground and we are sub
jected to an overwrought heal
ing process that we knew was 
coming all along.
Cameron wants us to see that 
this is a relationship where both
parties are flawed (shes neu
rotic, hes a business-minded 
workaholic), but there is never 
a doubt as to who is causing the 
problems here  the wife 
(played to her most annoying 
limits by Streeter Nelson). Even 
when she points out her 
husbands flaws, we are still on 
his side because she is whiny, 
screechy, andimpossible to take 
(probably more the fault of the 
playwright than the actress, but 
its difficult to tell).
Cameron wants us to believe 
her when she says, Im not blind, 
Im not stupid, Im not crazy. 
Shes all of the above, and sympa
thy for this woman is never a 
factor. Later, she tells the audi
ence, You must think Im aw
ful, and what were supposed to 
think is, No, not at all, dont be 
so hard on yourself  but she is 
awful. And so is the play.
The final play of the evening 
was Clarinet Camp by William 
Loeffler, the New Works king of 
one-liners. And there are some 
ho wlingly funny one-liners in this 
piece about a stand-up comic, 
Nathan, who is trying to win the 
heart of a blind date, Elissa, who 
doesnt like him. Hes given a 
little support by a vaguely stereo
typed gay waiter (played mag
nificently by Jim Cook) who tries 
to convince Elissa to give Nathan 
a chance.
The emotional heart of the play 
is awkwardly handled; Elissas 
monologue recounting her most
recent failed relationship is a sob 
story that weve all been through 
and heard beforewhy should it 
be more interesting when it hap
pens to this character? But the 
plays great strength is in its hu
mor, and Loeffler knows how to 
write snappy, clever dialogue 
without being tasteless (although 
Elissas out-of-the-blue inquiry 
about Nathans masturbatory 
habits comes dangerously close 
to crossing that line). On the 
whole, its a smart piece with a 
surprising resolution.
The Pittsburgh New Works 
Festival continues with play's 
every weekend through the end 
of the month. Call 881-6888 for 
more information.

Bottle Rocket
I know the guy who was the first assistant director 
on this movie. His name is Jim and hes really cool. 
Hes got a beard and his brother is Bobcat Goldthwait. 
Anyway, my sister-in-law used to have a crush on 
him back in Syracuse. She married my brother 
though, and now they have two kids.
So, about the movie. When my brother was in 
college, he snuck up to the door of his friend 
Howies room while Howie was having sex. He 
stuffed a bunch of bottle rockets underneath the 
door and lit them. He said it was really funny.

This movie is yet another addition to the clichd 
and overdone Thriller/Crime/Romance/Gangster/ 
Bondage/Lesbian/Sex genre, and yes, the main 
character is, once again, a bisexual plumber. Sigh.
Its the latest creative tour de force from Mario and 
Luigi, the Super Wachowski Brothers. Incidentally, 
does the fact that I never beat world eight and saved 
the real princess make me inadequate? I mean, I 
could save the little Strawberry Shortcakes on all the 
other worlds, but by the time I got to 8-3,1 never had 
enough guys left, even after warping. This summer, 
I played Mario 64 for the first time and, man, Ive 
been out-evolved by kids with more fingers.

It could happen to you. Yeah, right. When was the 
last time a burly truck guy stole your wife and sent 
you on a crazed rampage through the desert in a 
frenzied attempt to rescue her from his evil clutches?
Speaking of old Disney films, remember The 
Computer Wore Tennis Shoes? Or how about Now 
You See Him, Now You Dont? Now those were 
some of Kurt Russells finest. None of this Captain 
Ron shit, that was some hard-core acting. You 
know, come to think of it, Jodie Foster did some 
classic Disney flicks too, like Candleshoe and Freaky 
Friday. Martin Scorcese sure did both Disney and 
her a favor when he was kicking back with a cold 
one and said, Damn, I gotta make me a movie with 
a 12-year-old hooker in it.

Allow me to set the scene. World War III is over 
and done with, and in this new, enlightened age 
leaders have realized the futility of killing off 
hundreds of thousands of soldiers when you can 
put those soldiers to work building giant robots. 
Then you take one of the soldiers, usually Achilles 
cause hes got a bad foot, and you put him inside 
the robot and say, Achilles, I want you to take this 
baby up to Alaska and kick the crap out of the guy 
in the other robot for the old stars and stripes. Can 
you do that, son?
And Achilles shouts patriotically, Yes, sir!, 
mostly because theres a gun pointed at his head. 
So now that the scene is set, good old Achilles and 
his big freaking robot set down to some serious 
mechanical ass-whoopin.

Mysterious women fill Hewlett
By NIA RODGERS
Tartan Staffwriter
This month, the Hewlett Gal
lery is hosting a party of glitter
ing goddesses created by Pitts
burgh artist Patty Gallagher. An 
elite club of bronze, silver, and 
gold women, dressed in colorful 
garments of flourishing plants 
and flowers, profile in the in
terior space and challenge the 
viewer to define them.
Mysteries fill the gallery. 
Who are these women? A sheet 
asks you to match the god
desses with their characteris
tics and tarot designations. 
Some speak riddles and sing 
with the voices of violins, while 
others exude feelings in floral 
fragrances.
In an intimate comer a man
nequin goddess, named 
Athene, leans close to a visi
tor in a chair and records his 
confessions. One goddess, 
crowned with a bowler hat, 
has strewn the floor with the 
remnants of her daisy dress. 
The petals of the tossed flow
ers proffer weird messages 
like DAISY! DAISY!. Oth
ers exclaim, What a good 
idea!!! and some bear disassoci
ated names from another time, 
perhaps names of people you 
could be, used to be, or would like 
to be.
The installation creates a for
est fantasy land where you can be 
a different person, a queen, a 
flapper of the twenties, or a lady 
of distinction. A placard, with a 
passage describing a milliners 
shop at Christmas, lures you to 
sit at a dressing table in the rear
of the gallery. It invites you to try 
on a host of floral hats and shoes 
festooned with palm fronds and 
birds nests, while spotlights and 
mirrors display a vision of the 
alternative you.
There is an illusion of living, 
moving plants, as if fairies and 
nymphs danced in the lushness
In the opposite chair sits 
Sylvia, a goddess-spirit imbued 
with life. She chats with visitors 
in the gallery. Come sit down 
and talk to me, she says cheer
ily. She talks about the other 
goddesses, the mannequins who 
cant really say a lot for them
selves. All of our costumes are

just out of sight. Pineapples 
sprout from a rotating parasol 
above a table of ferns, sunflowers, 
ivy, and daisies. Butterflies nestle 
among the palm fronds, roses, 
birds, frogs, and buds, threaten

grapes reside in cocktail glasses,

made from the foundations of 
women ... antique bras, girdles, 
bodices and slips.
A green ivy hat rests atop her 
straight black hair and coordi
nates with her ivy costume. I 
have many, many hats, she says. 
She was a bull rider and 
Nefertitis make-up artist. She 
hung out with Robin Hood in 
Sherwood Forest. She invented 
all kinds of things that helped 
women get out, like the bra and
lipstick and eyeshadow and, most 
importantly, the pill. But now 
she says, wasnt it nice of Patty to 
re-create her in this restful place?
Sylvias past lives, and the pos
turing and costuming of the man
nequins, emphasize the themes 
of display and status within the 
context of the stories of women 
over time. Their names, taken 
from Greek mythology, lend a 
feeling of antiquity and mys
tery while establishing who 
is who among them. One 
woman kneels, another re
clines by the side of the wall. 
At the center, three crowned 
goddesses in bright full length 
dresses seem to preside over 
the others, while Helen, a 
mannequin clad in insects, 
seems to be snubbed as she 
rests in a shopping cart with 
her baby.
Their costumes made of an
tique undergarments pay hom
age to the situations of women 
of the more recent past while 
acknowledging the links be
tween women in all times. Their 
faces and postures seem com
fortable with the knowledge 
that they are being seen as the  
women they are.
Patty!... Set the table is full of 
colorful kitsch mysticism that 
exudes a feeling of time and of the 
transcendence of the stories of 
women. It invites the viewer to 
explore his or her own percep
tions and premonitions while pondering recurring themes in 
womens lives.

October 3.Audiences lose with The Game
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
It has been said that moviegoers are sup
posed to forget reality when they walk into 
the theater  an act called the willing sus
pension of disbelief. I walked into The Game 
willing, but it didnt take me anywhere. Oh 
sure, for a little while I was caught up in the 
action and wondering how Michael Douglas 
was going to get out of his predicament, but, 
in the end, I walked home feeling manipu
lated, my intelligence insulted.
What: The Game 
Director: David Fincher 
Company: Polygram Filmed 
Entertainment
The story centers around Nicholas Van 
Orton (Douglas), a divorced banker who ap
pears to lead a rather empty existence. He 
doesnt have a good relationship with his 
brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), and has finally 
reached the age his father was when he 
committed suicide. One day before his 48th
birthday, his brother meets him for lunch and 
gives him a card. It is a gift certificate of sorts 
for a company called Consumer Recreation 
Services. What they do is create a unique 
game for each client that will, as Nicholas 
later finds out, lead to a new view of the self.
At first skeptical, Nicholas eventually lets 
his curiosity overcome him, and he visits the 
offices of the company where his nightmare 
begins and the thriller kicks into full gear. 
Through a series of strange episodes we are 
placed in a paranoid world, where no one is 
to be trusted, as the company warps his life. 
Although this buildup is executed in the best 
possible manner, it is startlingly ordinary. 
It is as if the creators looked at a bunch of 
films, decided what worked, and threw it 
together so that we would freak out along 
with our hero.
Despite this, the major flaw is the totally 
unbelievable resolution to the discourse that 
would remind anyone with an ounce of com
mon sense that the action was confined to a 
movie screen. I assume that this is not the 
effect the filmmakers wanted, since thrillers 
seek to immerse the viewers in the claustro
phobic action. Without giving away the plot! 
line that I could have bested in fourth grade, 
Ill just say that there is too much joy in the 
atmosphere at the conclusion. In short, I felt 
everyone involved in the film was playing a 
game with my mind.
Nothing stands out in this film; its all 
competent, but nothing is great. Considering 
director David Finchers last movie was Seven, 
I was expecting a little bit of that films 
intelligence to carry over, but I was disap
pointed. The fine acting and solid script of his 
former feature are noticeably absent here 
and desperately needed. Perhaps the best 
actor in The Game is Sean Penn as the troubled 
Conrad, who effectively remains an enigma 
over the course of the action. The rest of the 
cast is adequate, but there are no Oscar 
performances here.
As a final note, I noticed Nicholass birth
day was October 12, Columbus Day. Are the 
screenwriters comparing the discoveries made 
by Nicholas during the film with those of 
Columbus? Though the Vikings did beat him 
to America, I hate to see Columbus belittled 
by a standard-issue thriller.Pizza places undergo examination
PIZZA, from page LI
multitude of transgressions.
The pizza itself isnt bad, but 
the garlic-and-seasoning-coated 
breadsticks are better. You can 
make a whole meal out of an 
order of them and some tomato 
sauce for dipping. The cheese is 
kind of rubbery. Even worse, it 
tends to get all stringy and stick 
to the top of the box, which isnt 
a very appetizing picture.
If you ignore the oozing cheese
and concentrate on the crust, which 
is nicely puffed-up and chewy, and 
the sauce, which is fine, youll end 
up satisfied. Especially if you use 
your DineXpress. Food always 
tastes better if you dont 
have to shell out actual 
cash for it.
Getting hungry? So am 
I. Now, if youll excuse 
me, I think I hear a 
slice of pizza calling 
my name.
