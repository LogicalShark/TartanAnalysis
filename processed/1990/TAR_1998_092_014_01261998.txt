Ex-marine gives speech
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Last Monday, highly contro
versial former Marine Lieuten
ant Colonel Oliver North gave a 
presentation entitled The 
Future of Conservatism in 
America to a capacity crowd in 
DH 2210. The presentation was 
sponsored by The Phoenix 
News Journal and Young 
Americas Foundation.
North is best -------------
known for his in
volvement in the 
Iran/Contra 
hearings of the 
late 80s, as well 
as his highly po
litical radio talk 
show, ranked in 
the top 10 in the 
nation. He, along 
with others in 
the Reagan administration-, was 
accused of illegally diverting 
funds from the sale of arms to 
Iran in order to support the 
Contras in Nicaragua. He was 
convicted, but the convictions 
were later overturned in ap
peals, some due to material that 
could not be declassified due to 
national security. Additionally, 
there were unconfirmed rumors 
of North and the CIA being in
volved in Nicaraguan cocaine 
smuggling operations.
Students, faculty, and staff of 
both CMU and the University of 
Pittsburgh, as well as members 
of the community attended the 
speech. The audience was a mix 
of people for North, people
against him, and people who 
were just plain curious to see 
what a man whom Americans 
have labeled both patriot and 
criminal would say.
According to North, very few 
conservatives are asked to 
speak to college campuses, 
which are traditionally liberal 
institutions. But to get ones 
message across, one has to head 
into the front lines. Its easy to 
preach to the choir, said North.
Nicaragua, you knew damn well 
that the Contras were smuggling 
cocaine into the United States. 
The audience became polarized, 
some cheering, others yelling 
back, asking him to calm him
self and sit down.
Try and get a grip, said North 
in response. This elicited more 
applause, but the heckler 
continued yelling at North. Af
ter a few more minutes of this, 
the man was

hear a different side that we don't

The Phoenix Publisher
Ive never shied away from a 
fight yet. And a fight is what 
North received.
North approached the podium 
to thunderous applause, while 
one woman hissed at him. The 
controversy surrounding North 
came to the immediate forefront 
before North finished his first 
sentence, as he was shouted 
down by an outraged member of 
the audience.
You are a drug-smuggling, 
gun-running, war criminal 
scumbag! shouted the uniden
tified man. The large portion of 
the audience opposed to the 
former colonel applauded the 
man. Thats right, pig. Not only 
did you deal guns to terrorists in
escorted out 
of the audito
rium by CMU 
police officers, 
and North 
said, I tell 
you, I
wouldnt have 
missed that

The com
ments beforehand were pretty 
funny, said Marc Wisnosky, a 
senior at the University of Pitts
burgh majoring in medieval 
studies and editor of The Phoe
nix. Im sure Mr. North is used 
to it, hes probably gotten that 
kind of thing before.
His presentation was struc
tured aro,und five questions he 
hoped each audience member 
would think about: What is it 
that you expect the government 
to do? Does any particular law

White House scandal 
brings press to CMU
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
When news broke last Wednesday evening that President 
Clinton had allegedly had an af
fair with White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky in 1995, most 
Carnegie Mellon students re
acted as they would to any other 
piece of major national news: 
some were very interested, some 
mildly so, and some not at all.
As the story unfolded, however, 
a small fact turned up, bringing 
reporters from all over the nation 
to CMUs campus. Mike 
Lewinsky, younger brother of 
Monica Lewinsky, is a sophomore
IM major and Phi Kappa Theta 
(Phi Kap) brother here at Carn
egie Mellon.
Since the story unfolded Re
porters have been attempting to 
contact Lewinsky about the situ
ation unfolding with his sister in 
Washington, D.C. Thursday 
night, NBC affiliate Channel 11 
News reported that Lewinsky 
was a CMU student.
While Lewinsky and Phi Kap 
president Derek Rutledge de
clined to comment on the situa
tion, the Office of University Re
lations did report that Fox 53 
reporters visited twice, an Asso
ciated Press (AP) reporter vis
ited three times, both ABC and
CBS news called the fraternity, 
a Los Angeles Times reporter 
approached the house three 
times, and Good Morning 
America showed a video clip of 
the fraternity house on its Fri
day morning program.
Weve been in touch with his 
lawyers, and their advice and 
our plan is to do the same with 
every reporter, said Rutledge in 
an AP report. Were looking out 
for his best interest. We want to 
keep it low-key and keep it quiet. 
Reporters, however, did not 
give up on the Carnegie Mellon

Student Life director resigns
By DANIEL ARP

& ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
John Hannon, assistant direc
tor of Student Life, announced 
he was leaving his position at 
the end of the semester after 
four years with the University. 
Hannon became the third Stu
dent Life administrator to an
nounce resignation in the last 
four months.
It was an extremely difficult 
decision, because Ive had a very 
positive experience at CMU, 
said Hannon. In many ways, 
this has been like my dr earn j ob....
I just felt like it was a point in my 
life when I wanted to pursue 
some other professional and per
sonal opportunities.
Hannon will be moving to Cali
fornia this summer to start a 
consulting business which will 
focus on training and developing 
small companies.
I can say unequivocally that 
[Hannon] stands apart from any 
other supervisor I have ever had, 
said Peter Barbalias, a coordi
nator of Student Life. Clearly, 
he has left an indelible mark 
here  one which will not be 
easy to duplicate. I am not ex cited about the prospect of his 
departure because of the direct
loss I will feel personally and 
professionally.
Student Life has a number of 
holes to fill after the loss of fam
ily programs coordinator Mary 
Hoover earlier this month and 
associate director Allison Riley 
at the end of last semester. 
Hoover left to take a position in 
the Heinz School. Riley moved to 
Boston where her husband had 
acquired a job.
Were going to continue with
out filling those positions 
through the spring semester, 
said Michael Murphy, dean of 
Student Affairs. Its unusual for 
a person to leave a position at

Last Monday afternoon, Janu
ary 19, a group of protesters led 
by the Pittsburgh Demilitarized 
Zone (DMZ) gathered outside 
Warner Hall to rally against 
CMUs Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day celebration policy and its 
acceptance of research money 
from the United States Depart
ment of Defense.
As students and professors 
walked by, paying little or no 
attention to the protesters, 
Cornell Womack of the DMZ read 
one of Kings speeches through a 
bullhorn. Other protestors held a 
cloth banner which read Sur
render to Peace.
Vince Eirene, coordinator of 
the protest, argued that Dr. King 
would oppose military research 
now since King was a pacifist 
during his lifetime. He also main
tains that, despite CMU Presi
dent Jared Cohons decision to 
cancel afternoon classes on MLK 
Day starting next year, the Uni
versity doesnt adequately 
celebrate the day. Because of 
these two reasons, the DMZ 
chose the day that commemo
rates Kings achievements for the 
most recent in a 13-year chain of 
protests of the Software 
Engineering Institutes (SEI)

question about that, said Don 
Hale, CMU vice president for 
University Relations, in response 
to Eirenes view that CMUs 
miltary contracts are unethical. 
But a lot of the work that De
fense has funded over the years 
is basic research that has appli
cations across society.... Within 
[SEI] you have the Computer 
Emergency Response Team, 
which is the leading organiza
tion for investigating break-ins 
on computer networks and so on. 
It has to do with computer security.... There are plenty of ex
amples like that that go well 
beyond labelling something as 
military or defense-oriented. 
CMUs administration re
mained unfazed by the protest
ers critique of their policies. 
Vince [Eirene], as he has many 
times before, has the freedom to 
come out and express his point of 
view about things. Thats clear 
and we support that, said Hale.

administrators of student opinion
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The Vice Presidential Student Advi
sory Committee (VPSAC), a new initia
tive that allows top level administrators 
to be informed of student opinion, held 
its first full meeting on January 13.
The goals [of VPSAC] are at least to 
test ideas and to use the students as a 
soundboard to find out how things are. 
Ive always been interested in getting a 
sample of student opinion, said Dr. Bill 
Elliot, vice president for Enrollment.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy and Student Body President 
Bryon Krug selected the 18 students on 
the committee. The initiative was part 
f a joint effort between Student Gov
ernment and Student Affairs to give 
students more of an opportunity to af
fect policy on campus.
It had existed previously. It was
started when I was a student ombuds
man. Bill Elliot and Fred Rogers [the 
vice president of Enrollment at the time] 
felt it would be good to have students 
advise them, said Murphy.
Although Murphy said that there was 
no precipitating event, the original 
VPSAC was discontinued about three 
years ago. The second incarnation of 
VPSAC has had a rough beginning. The 
first meeting, scheduled for late Octo
ber, was cut short due to the Wean Hall 
fire and Pat Keating, vice president for 
Business Affairs, is leaving CMU effec
tive February 1. Jeff Bolton, the interim 
vice president for Business Affairs, is 
filling in for Keating at the meetings.
I was disappointed that we stopped 
it, Elliot said. So Pat [Keating] and I 
tried to get it started again.
The students on the panel, according 
to Elliot, either respond to his questions 
or offer their opinions and complaints on
issues that he hasnt thought of. Most of 
the things we talked about at this meet
ing were things that were on my mind, 
said Elliot.
The first meeting went well, according 
to Neil Donnelly, a junior materials sci
ence engineering major, and Grant 
Bromhal, a doctoral student in civil and 
environmental engineering, two stu
dents on the committee. Some of the 
topics that were discussed ranged from 
the campus shuttle to online 
registration (OLR). The shuttles ser
vice area is being considered for expan
sion to cover more of the Squirrel Hill 
area and the panel contributed to the 
volume of opinions available to adminis
tration about OLR.
Security is always an interesting is
sue, said Elliot. When you have it and 
you dont need it, you wonder why youre 
paying for it. But when you need it, you

Pope advocates freedom 
of expression during visit
SANTIAGO, Cuba (AP) - Pope John 
Paul II delivered the most direct po
litical message yet in his pilgrimage to 
Cuba on Saturday, advocating free
dom of expression and association for 
the islands people.
Making the last provincial stop of 
his five-day visit, the Pope empha
sized the churchs prominent role in 
Cuban history and said Catholics had 
the duty and the right to participate 
in public debate.
The good of a nation must be pro
moted and achieved by its citizens 
themselves, he said during a service 
in Santiago, 530 miles east of Havana. 
In this way each person, enjoying 
freedom of expression... and enjoying 
appropriate freedom of association, 
will be able to cooperate effectively in 
the pursuit of the common good. 
Tens of thousands turned out for 
the Mass in Santiago, a center of 
Cuban nationalism. The Mass was 
dedicated to Cubas patron saint and 
potent symbol of patriotism, the 
Virgin of Charity.
Before the Popes homily, Santiago 
Archbishop Pedro Meurice, in an un
usually blunt allusion to Cubas oneparty system, criticized Cubans who 
have confused patriotism with a party. 
Later, the crowd chanted, John Paul, 
our brother, now you are a Cuban. 
On the fourth day of his historic first 
visit to Cuba, the pope was visiting 
leprosy and AIDS patients at a shrine 
and clinic on Havanas outskirts.
At stop after stop, addressing young 
parents, country kids, the cultural 
elite in Havana, John Paul has re
turned to the same theme on his 
groundbreaking visit: Cuba needs 
Roman Catholic education.
In a land where Catholic schools 
have been closed for more than three 
decades, the school option is emerg
ing as a goal the church apparently 
hopes is achievable in some way under 
a liberalizing communist system.
The Pope took his message Friday 
evening to the neoclassical halls of the 
University of Havana.
In sonorous, thickly accented Span
ish, the pontiff told a gathering of 
leading academics, writers, and other 
intellectuals that Cuban cultural in
stitutions  clearly meaning univer
sities  should work with the church 
in a fruitful cultural dialogue.
The climax comes Sunday morning, 
when the Pope celebrates Mass in 
Havanas Plaza of the Revolution, of
fering Holy Communion in a vast space 
flanked by towering images of commu
nist revolutionary hero Ernesto Che 
Guevara and the Sacred Heart  a 
temporary nine-story portrait of Christ.
I havent been to Mass in many 
years. Many years, craggy-faced re
tiree Felicito Gonzalez, 74, told a re
porter as he waited for a bus in Ha
vana. But Ill be there Sunday. The 
whole city will be there.
In recent years, Castro has loosened 
some strictures on religion. Cuban 
churchmen now clearly consider 
achieving more space in education a 
key to building a broader following for 
a weak church. Although perhaps 40 
percent of Cubans are baptized Catho
lics, probably no more than five per
cent attend Mass regularly.
Just Wednesday, at the Popes ar
rival ceremony, Castro pointedly raised 
his own memories of a Catholic educa
tion  of how, he said, he was taught 
intolerance for other religions, and of 
how he would ask his teachers why no 
black children attended the schools.
I have not forgotten the unconvinc
ing answers I was given, Castro 
told the Pope.
In an interview this week with the 
Associated Press, Cubas culture min
ister, Abel Prieto, addressed the issue 
more directly, saying the government 
considers education something that 
strategically we have to maintain un
der state control.
Clinton cautiously 
endorses Arafat
WASHINGTON (AP) - Yasser Arafat 
went home without a settlement with 
Israel  getting one overnight was never 
in the cards  but with a strong U.S. 
endorsement of Palestinian aspirations.
Arafat wants a state, and he has de
clared he will set one up independently 
if Israel does not agree to a state in 
negotiations. He also intends to place its 
capital in Jerusalem.
Arafat wound up his talks here Friday 
rejecting an Israeli offer for a limited 
pullback on the West Bank, calling it 
peanuts. But he praised President 
Clinton for a statement he made Thurs
day. In it, Clinton said U.S. policy in the 
Middle East was based on land for peace. 
That means Israel should surrender 
land in exchange for peace with security 
from the Arabs.
I think this is a very important decla
ration of President Clinton, Arafat said. 
I think what President Clinton declared 
is very clear.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
at a news conference Friday, said 
Clintons intention was to show Arafat 
his understanding of the legitimate 
rights of the Palestinian people.
Told Arafats aides were saying this 
brought the United States closer to 
endorsing the idea of a Palestinian 
state, Albright said, What you hear 
and what you see is what it means. And 
that is what the President meant; it is 
that he believes that the Palestinian 
people have that aspiration and it should 
be respected.
The statements by Clinton and 
Albright on Palestinian aspirations were 
only one indication the administration 
was expanding its role in the stymied 
Mideast peace process.
ESL education in 
hands of voters
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A strange 
thing happened when Fernando Vega 
stuck three signs in his front yard.
The signs read Ingles Para Los 
Nios  English for the children  in
support of a contentious California ballot 
initiative seeking to halt English as a 
second language (ESL) education, which 
teaches children in their native languages. 
But the placards proved a lure to some of 
the very people thought to be most sup
portive of bilingual education  Spanish
speaking parents hoping to help their 
kids. They came knocking on his door.
Seor, what do you have to do to get 
into your school? they asked. The 
schools dont teach my children English.
Vega, a retired airline mechanic and 
former school board member in Red
wood City, says the parents misplaced 
enthusiasm only boosted his passion to 
dismantle the ESL education system he 
had fought to build in the late 1960s.
It was supposed to be about kids learn
ing English, overcoming language 
barriers, says Vega. Thats not hap
pening anymore.
The initiative would require public 
school pupils to be taught in English, 
except when parents specifically ask for 
bilingual help. Children who come to 
school speaking little or no English would 
spend their first year in a sheltered 
English immersion class.
The opponents of the initiative say 
that they dont want to lose their roots.
Two weeks ago, Hispanic parents kept 
379 students out of Santa Barbara el
ementary schools for three days to pro
test the school boards unanimous deci
sion to halt ESL education. Some 600 
people attended a raucous school board 
meeting, with at least 100 speaking.
For some Hispanics, allowing Spanish
speaking children to learn in their own 
language is a deeply cultural issue, funda
mentally different from the rapid, eager 
assimilation of earlier immigrant waves.
Family anguishes 
over plea bargain
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Even 
now, David and Wanda Kaczynski an
guish over the forces that turned their 
brother and son, Ted, into the murder
ous Unabomber.
My mother and father and I ques
tioned ourselves for years: Where did we 
fail Ted? David said Friday.
The Kaczynskis finally found some 
relief when they recently learned that a
prison psychiatrist diagnosed him as a 
paranoid schizophrenic.
On Thursday, Theodore Kaczynski 
agreed to a plea bargain in which he 
pleaded guilty to 13 federal charges cov
ering five Unabomber attacks in ex
change for a sentence of life in prison 
without parole.
The Kaczynskis spoke Friday of the 
harrowing days leading up to Teds ad
mission that he is the Unabomber.
On the day he attempted suicide, we 
wanted to rush over there and throw our 
arms around him and say, We love you; 
youre not alone, David, 47, said.
The plea bargain was a relief to David, 
who had strenuously objected to the 
government seeking the death penalty. 
And he still regrets all the pain he 
caused his brother for turning him 
in to the FBI.
I think he has some perception that 
people think of him as a sicko and they 
dont believe hes a human being, said 
David. We know hes a valuable and 
precious and important human being  
and we love him.
Court finds for 
religious judge
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A judge 
will be allowed to continue displaying 
the Ten Commandments behind the 
bench and conducting prayers before 
court after the Alabama Supreme Court 
rejected a religious-freedom lawsuit on 
technical grounds.
The high court said Friday that Gover
nor Fob James and Attorney General Bill 
Pryor had no legal standing to bring the 
lawsuit, which sought to endorse Circuit 
Judge Roy Moores religious practices.
That matter is not necessarily offi
cially closed. Someone who objects to the 
prayers and the posting of the Ten Com
mandments is still free to sue on grounds 
that they violate the Constitutional sepa
ration of church and state.
The court also rejected a related chal
lenge in the legally contorted case. The 
American Civil Liberties Union of Ala
bama and the Alabama Freethought 
Association had sued Chief J ustice Perry 
Hooper, contending he had the power to 
stop Moores practices.Testimony from intern on allegations could jeopardize Clinton presidency
WASHINGTON (AP) - Monica 
Lewinsky is offering to testify 
that she did have a sexual rela
tionship with President Clinton, 
if Whitewater prosecutors will 
give her immunity from peijury, 
a source familiar with the nego
tiations said Saturday.
Such a posture leaves open, how
ever, what Lewinsky would say 
on the most serious allegations 
against Clinton: whether he or his 
friend, Vernon Jordan, encour
aged her to lie about the relation
ship under oath.
The developments came as Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starr, 
the Whitewater prosecutor, was 
continuing to subpoena witnesses 
and gather evidence in the probe of 
whether Clinton conspired to cover 
up the alleged affair with Lewinsky, 
a former White House intern.
Her chief lawyer, William 
Ginsburg, met Friday with Starr 
in the first volley of negotiations 
on a possible plea agreement for 
the young woman. She signed a 
sworn affidavit on January 7 
explicitly denying any sexual 
relationship with Clinton and 
would face peijury charges if that 
document no longer squares 
with her story.
Those Friday night talks ended 
without a deal, but a source fa
miliar with the talks said 
Lewinskys attorney made clear 
to Starr that she would admit the 
affair if protected from prosecu
tion herself.
Starr and Ginsburg were ex
pected to meet again Saturday, 
but Ginsburg, who refused to com
ment on the substance of nego
tiations, said he was waiting for
the prosecutor make a move. Hes 
got to call me. He needs my lady, 
Ginsburg said.
Meanwhile, the investigation 
steamed forward, with Jordan, 
Clintons longtime friend and con
fidant, scheduled to appear Tues
day before a grand jury to explain 
why he helped arrange a job and 
get a lawyer for Lewinsky.
Lewinsky is heard on secret 
tape recordings telling a friend 
and Pentagon co-worker, 
Linda Tripp, that she had an 
affair with Clinton and that 
he and Jordan encouraged her 
to deny it.
Ginsburg confirmed that pros
ecutors offered Lewinsky, 24, 
immunity when FBI agents first 
approached her a week ago, pro
vided she participate in a sting 
operation against Clinton and
Jordan. Ginsburg did not accept 
the offer immediately, and it 
was not renewed.
Clinton met with his Cabinet 
Friday, denying the accusations 
once again. Im going to be fine, 
and you will be, too, and lets all 
hang in there, he was quoted as 
telling his department heads.
Although Lewinsky denied an 
affair with Clinton under oath, 
lawyers and others familiar with 
the taped conversations said 
Lewinsky told Tripp that she 
performed oral sex on him 
many times.
The sources said Lewinsky as
serts on the tapes that Clinton 
had been seeing at least four other 
women, three of whom worked at 
the White House, and that she 
was angry about it.
Lewinsky was 21 when she
went to work at the White House 
in 1995. In the taped conversa
tions, she expressed a high 
school kind of jealousy, some
times anger, sometimes frustra
tion about the President, ac
cording to one source.
The tapes also quote Lewinsky 
as saying that the alleged sexual 
encounters were not frequent, 
not daily, not weekly, but 
infrequent; more than 10 
times, less than dozens, said 
the source.
At the same time, the source 
also said the tapes reflect 
Lewinsky telling Tripp that as 
the physical relationship winds 
down, there are more and more 
phone calls between Clinton 
and Lewinsky.
Ginsburg said Starr wired 
Tripp for recording sound and
he lured Ms. Lewinsky to the 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon 
City (a section of nearby Arling
ton, Va.) and, with the help of 
four or five FBI agents and three 
or four U.S. attorneys, managed 
to detain her  although she was 
technically free to go  for eight 
or nine hours without an attor
ney. That should frighten anyone 
who is involved in the process 
here in America.
Starr issued a statement Fri
day saying Ginsburgs allegations 
that Lewinsky was mistreated 
are wholly erroneous.
Starr said the young woman 
consented to meet with the 
FBI agents and attorneys, was 
asked to cooperate with the 
investigation, and was repeat
edly informed that she was 
free to leave.

50 YEARS AGO, March 2, 
1948  Expressing a deep con
viction that one hasnt had a start 
on education until he has gone 
through this sort of thing, Presi
dent Doherty gave unqualified 
support to the introduction of 
term papers into the senior social 
relations program. This among 
other questions were answered 
at a dinner meeting of the Stu
dent Conference committee held 
on February 25, in Skibo.
Term papers were brought be
fore the committee when a mem
ber made the statement. He 
claimed that senior engineers not 
only are already sufficiently burdened with work, but that 
the writing of a long term paper 
would be of little value to them 
as engineers.
25 YEARS AGO, January 16, 
From National Weather Service bulletins and other sources' 1973Anewurbangame was to
Carnegie Almanac
be developed at Carnegie Mellon 
University which was designed 
to show future urban managers 
how a city really works, instead 
of how it ought to work. The Uni
versity received $65,000 from the 
General Electric Foundation to 
develop the game, one of 11 grants 
awarded that year under the 
Foundations Educational Incen
tive Awards program.
The computer-assisted game 
was for a semester-long course 
primarily for second-year 
masters students in the School 
of Urban and Public Affairs.
10 YEARS AGO, January 26, 
1988  A printer was stolen from 
the printing room in the Univer
sity Computer Center cluster 
while the PC consultant on duty 
was working with some disks.
But that afternoon a caller 
asked the UCC cluster a question
referring to the problem that a 
stolen printer from CMU would 
possibly give a thief. The man 
asked why he cant get around 
the password file set up for the 
Andrew system. There was 
enough time to put a trace on the 
call. The police obtained a search 
warrant and found not only the 
printer but several other stolen 
items from CMU and from Uni
versity of Pittsburgh.
FIVE YEARS AGO, January
25,1993  The next step toward 
the completion of the University 
Center after the construction crews 
finished the tennis courts was to 
tear down the Skibo building.
Edward Schatz, project manager 
for the University Center said, If 
the funding is in place, Skibo will 
probably begin to come down in the 
month of June. He also stated 
that if funding was not avaiable
then Skibo wasnt to come down 
until the following school year.The 
plans called for 30 months of con
struction. Also the sidewalk be
tween Resnik and West Wing resi
dence halls was scheduled to be 
extended to the Cut.
ONE YEAR AGO, January 27, 
1997  University Housing, Stu
dent Life and Health officials met 
with Student Dormitory Council 
members and other interested stu
dents to discuss a proposal for es
tablishing wellness housing.
Henderson Hall was the pro
posed site for the program which 
intended to promote healthy and 
spiritual living. The proposal 
called for 20 residents who would 
agree to live in a substancefree environment.

Carnegie Mellon In Brief
Student Contacts 
replace mentors
The Office of International Educa
tion and the International Student 
Union are inviting students to share 
their knowledge of CMU, Pittsburgh, 
and the U.S. with new international 
students. The position is that of a 
Student Contact.
Student Contacts will serve as re
source people and can be either from the 
U.S. or abroad. Each volunteer will be 
assigned to one or two new students 
whom they will correspond with via email 
(or regular mail) before the student ar
rives in Pittsburgh, and meet during 
two social events at the beginning of the 
semester. This program, formerly known 
as the Peer Mentor Program, is ex
tremely important to new international 
students. However, a limited level of 
commitment is required.
Volunteer responsibilities include a 
training session, two letters to the new 
student, and attendence at two social 
events with the pupil. This position is 
available to both graduates and under
graduates. Those interested should con
tact gfsadv+@andrew. cmu.edu.
Entropy East now 
offers new films
Entropy East is now offering a limited 
selection of Blockbuster videos for rental. 
The store is also selling popcorn. A 
CMU ID is necessary to rent a video.
The store, which is in the old co-op 
building, now also features CDs. This 
allows students to get their grocery needs 
and the nights entertainment in one 
convenient location.
Meeting develops 
new school plan
A town meeting regarding a strategic 
plan that will guide the University for 
the next several years will be held at 4 
pm this Tuesday, January 27 in 
McConomy Auditorium. The meeting 
will give members of the University com
munity the opportunity to comment and 
provide input regarding the develop
ment of a strategic planning document.
A draft of the document, resulting 
from a University-wide planning effort 
involving faculty, deans, department 
heads, administrators, and students, is 
available on the Web at http: 11 
www.cmu.edu/splan as of Monday, 
January 19. Draft copies are also avail
able through the office of the Vice Presi
dent for Planning and Budget.
Institute provides 
research grants
The Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering 
Initiative (PTEI) announced the avail
ability of research funding through its 
Technology Development Fund grant 
program which supports product-driven 
research in the field of tissue engineer
ing. Funding will be available in amounts
up to $50,000 for one-year projects to 
commence in July 1998.
The program has made several 
changes to the application process that 
will make it more accessible. The com
mercialization information required 
in the grant application has been mini
mized. However, the emphasis on 
potentially commercializable tissue 
engineering applications remains. 
Also, the PTEI, designed to unite the 
talents of Pittsburghs many univer
sities faculties, encourages applica
tions from inter-institutional 
research teams, although this is not 
a prerequisite.
The application deadline is March 
13. Application materials are avail
able from the PTEI.
H&SS sponsors 
first solo job fair
H&SS will be sponsoring a job fair

programs and majors.
Art majors have 
chance at award
The Pittsburgh Foundation is ac
cepting applications for the Virginia
C. Lewis Scholarship Fund until 
March 15. The applicant must be an

declared their major in art or art his
tory and are attending an accredited 
college or university with a bona fide 
fine arts department are encouraged 
to apply for this scholarship, which 
.will not exceed $6,000.
The scholarship fund was created 
in 1996 from Lewis $150,000 bequest

dergraduate students majoring in art 
or art history.
Although a full-time student, the 
recipient of last years award has de
voted her spare time to Pittsburghs 
museums by restoring paintings dat
ing back to the early 1900s.
Student Centers 
name changes
The building known as the 
Student Center has had a name 
change to clearly distinguish it from 
the University Center. Its official 
name is 4902 Forbes Avenue. All ref
erences to the building should carry 
the new name.

Student Senate Minutes
Conservative shares principles
VPSAC, from page 1
can never have enough. Because of this, 
campus security was a big issue at the 
meeting last week.
Several elements of the security issue 
were discussed. One problem the panel 
brought up was poor lighting on parts 
of campus, particularly 
around Doherty Hall. Also 
considered was the locking 
down of the academic build
ings in the evening after 
classes. Students would 
then use a card reader to 
enter the buildings, much 
like they do to enter the 
University Center after 
hours.
Elliot expressed one prob
lem with this option. He noted that lock
ing buildings can bring a false sense of 
security since there remains the distinct 
possibility that an intruder can enter 
the building before it is locked and then
simply wait there. These quandaries are 
the type that the VPSAC has been de
signed to tackle.
The panel also raised the issue of 
transcripts and transcript fees. The stu
dents, according to Elliot, were upset 
about the large fees for transcripts and
also the time it takes to get them. With 
the issue of fees, youre always going to 
upset someone, said Elliot.
While Keating and Bolton conceded 
that there are some problems in the
transcript procedure, they also pointed 
out that the University does not charge 
students for enrollment verification 
for insurance companies and such. ;
Typically, insurance companies pro;- 
vide special rates for a student in col
lege, but they must verify that the stu
dent is in fact enrolled in 
college. CMU provides this 
service free of charge. This 
is something that CMU 
could start charging for in 
the future.
The committee also 
discussed parking, the 
bookstore, dining services, 
and what to do with the 
Morewood basement area 
before the meeting 
was adjourned.
Elliot is optimistic about the future of 
VPSAC. He said, This is one of the best 
ways to get feedback from our custom
ers, the students.
This is one of the best ways to 
get feedback from our customers, 
the students.

SPEAKER, from page 1
your expectations for what the govern
ment does realistic? In detailing his views 
on these questions, he spoke about indi
vidual liberties, the sovereignty of the 
country, and the sanctity of life, as well as 
sparking further controversy by referring 
to President Clinton as Caligula and the 
United Nations as a bunch of bluebonneted bozos.
After he finished his speech, North 
allowed a question and answer session. 
Questions ranged from the curious to 
the confrontational, with the latter pre
vailing. Student reactions to this ses
sion varied as much as reactions to the 
man himself.
I was just impressed by his articulate 
answers to some very intelligent student 
questions, said Jason Reinsch, a senior 
history and policy major. But not every
one agreed. I felt he didnt respond ad
equately to questions, said Adrian 
Herbez, a freshman art major.
Norths detractors held opinions as 
strongly felt as the colonels own beliefs. 
I think North is a real dork, said 
Cameron Byrne, a freshman at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh majoring in infor
mation science and Asian studies. His 
political analysis was complete crap be
cause hes a puppet for the right.
Program organizers expected strong 
reactions like this, due to Norths infamy 
and controversial views. One of the 
presentations organizers, Nathan 
Locklin, a junior University of Pittsburgh 
information science major and member 
of The Phoenix staff, explained why North 
was chosen.
North is well-known. We get to hear a 
different side that we dont usually get. 
Ive heard North speak in Washington,
D.C., and we got a really good deal on 
North. Phoenix founder Pat Mooney and 
Phoenix publisher Booker Stallworth both 
work for Oliver North.
Even those who disagreed with North 
had to admit that the presentation was a 
benefit to the campus. Im glad that 
Oliver North had the opportunity to 
speak, wrote Aaron Michaelson, a fresh
man professional writing major, on the 
emu.misc.market bboard. Its a prime 
example of free speech in action.

Protestors demonstrate in support of MLK Day
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor
Members of the Pittsburgh Demilitarized Zone read speeches, held banners, and spoke to camera crews in front of Warner Hall.
PROTEST, from page 1
pletely out of step ... [with] all the reac
tion Ive gotten from students, faculty, 
and staff, [which] has been very posi
tive, said Cohen.
Cohon and Hale also questioned the 
appropriateness of Eirenes pitting 
Kings memory against the defense con
tracting issue. The U. S. governments 
behavior in Vietnam [which King ac
tively opposed] is similar to or linked to 
its behavior toward the black commu
nity here in this country, said 
Cohon. But thats different 
from having a strong defense. 
The use of that defense is the issue. Hes 
got a real stretch there, linking what we 
do here with support from the DoD [De
partment of Defense] to the 
Vietnam War.
Both Cohon and Hale commented that 
they would like to see CMU students 
more politically active. It wouldnt 
bother me at all if there were more 
protests, especially if they involved stu
dents, said Cohon. Im mildly surprised
that [Eirene] would protest the 
Universitys policy on Martin Luther 
King Day.
Although the protest was on Univer
sity property and focused on University 
policy issues, CMU students made up 
only a small fraction of those involved. I 
think that as a campus we should come 
together to say No, I believe [King] was 
a great man, and we should do some
thing to observe his memory,  said 
Emily Moyer, a sophomore art major.
The protest wasnt attended by many 
and received little attention from the 
CMU community, yet it did garner some 
local notice. Harold Hayes, a reporter 
for KDKA television who came to cover 
the protest as well as the MLK commu
nity service activities offered by CMU, 
said that covering both sides [of the 
issue] would make it a complete story. 
The protest ensured that those who 
were interested could listen to other 
viewpoints. Lets hear what [Eirene] 
has to say, said Hale, and draw your 
own conclusions.
Crime and Incident Report
1/16 MEDICAL,8:43 pm - An 
officer went with a security guard 
to West Wing residence hall 
where a student was reported to 
have food poisoning. EMS who 
arrived before the police found 
the victim actively vomiting and 
complaining of nausea. He said 
that he had had milk earlier in 
the afternoon which may have 
been bad. He was taken to Pres
byterian Hospital for treatment.
1/16 MEDICAL* 9:19 pm - A 
CMU student had sustained an 
injury to her left ankle when she 
fell while skating at the Schenley 
Ice Rink. The victim was checked 
by EMS and transported to Uni
versity of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center for treatment. EMS pro
vided an ice pack for the victim to 
ease the swelling.
1/17 DEMONSTRATION,
11:37 am  Two officers were 
assigned to monitor a demonstra
tion at the Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI). There were, at 
one point, 43 protestors standing 
in front of SEI. The demonstra
tion, which was covered by two 
local news agencies, was in pro
test of SEIs involvement in the 
war in Mexico. Two hours passed 
peacefully and orderly, and the 
demonstration dispersed at 
around 1:30 pm.
1/17 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
2:59 pm  An officer was dis
patched to Hamburg Halls park
ing lot to take a report from a 
student. Her car, a black Nissan 
Sentra, had been parked there 
during the day, and someone had 
keyed the entirety of her black 
Nissan Sentra. The amount of 
the damage was unknown at the 
time of the report.
1/19 BURGLARY, 12:46 pm
 Campus Police took a burglary 
report from a victim in Amberson 
Apartments and sent out an of
ficer to investigate. He was met 
there by the victim and a City of
Pittsburgh police officer. The vic
tim showed the pair the rear bed
room window where the entry 
was made.
The actors broke out the bot
tom pane of glass in the center of 
the window, reached inside, and 
cranked it open so that they could 
access the interior. When the 
victims roommate returned, she 
noticed the door ajar and realized 
that they had been robbed.
The items that were stolen 
included a Magnavox television, 
a Toshiba laptop computer, and 
a Samsung videocassette re
corder. The items were valued at 
over $3000.
1/19 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
12:59 pm  An officer went to the 
Morewood Gardens computer 
cluster on a routine check and 
found that someone had spilled 
ice cream onto a computer and a 
keyboard causing the keys to stick 
in place. He removed the key
board and placed it inside the 
clusters closet to prevent any 
farther damage. CPS was noti
fied to clean up the ice cream on 
the carpet.
1/19 MEDICAL, 5:28 am - An 
officer was sent to Henderson Hall 
because a student there was not 
feeling well. When he arrived the 
student said that she had vom
ited three or four times since the 
previous day and that she could 
not keep anything down.
EMS responded and provided 
treatment, and then the officer 
transported her to Presbyterian 
Hospital.
1/19 THEFT, 3:15 pm - The 
victim reported that an excess of 
$600 had been taken from his 
Doherty Apartments residence 
over the Christmas break. The 
money had been located in his 
desk drawer. The victim believed 
his roommates were not the cul
prits because they both left before 
and returned after he did. There 
were no signs of forced entry and
his windows were locked prior to 
departure for break.
1/22 TRUCK THEFT, 6:56 
pm  A Carnegie Mellon Unit 
Manager phoned Campus Police 
to report that a Ford cargo van 
rented from Budget had been sto
len from the University Center 
loading dock. The white van was 
left there unlocked forone and a 
half hours. In addition, the keys 
were on the console, making an 
easy target for opportunists. The 
manager said that it is not an 
unusual thing for CMU drivers 
to leave unattended vehicles un
locked with keys inside. The of
ficer suggested that the manager 
change his key policy.
1/22 MEDICAL, 6:59 pm  
Campus Police responded to a 
call from the bus stop on Forbes 
Avenue near Warner Hall. There, 
on the temporary sidewalk, they 
found several students, one on 
the ground. Apparently the stu
dents had been horse-playing 
when the victim slipped on the 
icy walkway. He landed on his 
left arm.
EMS examined his arm and 
found an injury in the upper part. 
EMS recommended that the stu
dent be transported to the hospi
tal. The recommendation was 
carried out.
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the editor-inchief, the news editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of complain
ants, victims, suspects, and f'atemity 
names ai-e omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other 
personal details are given only in the 
context of complete desciiptions.
 Not every incident, that occurs 
appears in the report.

CMU attracts media coverage
MEDIA, from page 1
clined to comment and re
quested that they leave Phi Kap 
property. In the Channel 11 
story, a camera operator filmed 
reporter David Johnson enter
ing the fraternity to request an 
interview.
The camera __________
next filmed the 
brothers through 
the window 
playing pool 
as Johnson re
ported that they 
had refused to 
comment.
They really had
nothing to say __________
about this, said  
Johnson in his broadcast.
Then, Johnson approached 
CMU students at random, ques
tioning them about the fact that 
Mike Lewinsky is a 
CMU student.
Ive heard of the guy, but I 
havent seen him around, said 
sophomore chemistry major
Izzat Raheem in the news report. 
I never knew that someone like 
that could be going to this school
 it kind of puts this school on 
the map.
Johnson next approached Chris 
Vitolano, senior CEE major and 
Theta Xi brother. Im pretty
I know the guys over at Phi 
Kappa Theta, but Im really pretty 
shocked  I wasn't aware of it.  
 Chris Vitolano 
senior CEE major
shocked, Vitolano said to the cam
era. I know the guys over at Phi 
Kappa Theta, but Im really pretty 
shocked  I wasnt aware of [the 
fact that Mike Lewinsky is re
lated to Monica Lewinsky].
At first, [Johnson] didnt come 
up and ask for a comment, said 
Vitolano. He basically asked me
various questions about South
western Pennsylvania and we 
spoke casually for a few minutes. 
Then he asked if Id like to make a 
few comments to the news. 
Other news writers, however, 
were more aggressive in their 
pursuit of the story. A source who 
wished to re
main anony
mous reported 
that the AP 
newswriter 
whohadbeenat 
Phi Kap went to 
a sorority house 
as well.
When the so
rority sisters 
declined to com
ment about the situation to the 
reporter, the reporter harassed 
them and said that one of the 
sisters was being bitchy.
An AP representative, however, 
denies that its reporter would have 
acted in such a manner and stated 
that one of the sorority sisters had 
been overtly rude to the reporter.
Student Life director leaves CMU
RESIGN, from page 1
mid-year.... Were in the throes 
of discussion as to what to do 
with those positions next year.
Hannon will remain with Stu
dent Life until the end of the 
spring semester and head the 
national job search to 
replace him.
One reason [Hannon] an
nounced, [his resignation] now 
was so we could have a smooth 
transition [at that position], said 
Murphy. So thats really to 
his credit.
To fill the gaps left by the other 
two departures, coordinators 
Roxanne Zeisloft, Kevin Hughes, 
and Lisa Dingman have taken 
on extra duties.
Murphy declined to comment 
on whether there will be any 
restructuring of the vacant posi
tions, but he did say, Anytime 
theres a departure, you revisit 
the organizational structure. 
Barbalias said he sees no trend 
in the recent resignations. These 
departures are not indicative of 
anything other than people seeking new professional opportuni
ties. It is not uncommon in the 
field of student affairs to see cy
clical turnover, he said.
This office is the most sup
portive and functional I have ever 
seen. We support each other in 
unparalleled ways. There are 
many offices at other institutions 
I would never set foot in, let 
alone work in.... Honestly, I 
think the fear of not finding 
what we have here in this office 
becomes all too true in 
other institutions.

Media must cease 
sensational coverage
Once again, the media has taken 
it upon itself to devote all of its 
time and resources to one par
ticular story simply because of its 
scandalous nature. Reports that 
surfaced last week regarding an 
alleged affair between President 
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, a 
former White House intern, had 
their true journalistic roots in the 
fact that this incident could po
tentially lead to Presidential im
peachment. However, while this 
was the crux of the real news 
story, the media focused on the 
so-called scandalous side of the 
allegations and elevated this 
scandal story to the supreme 
heights of coverage.
By doing this, the media has 
once again proven that they are 
so hungry for ratings that they 
will push other extremely 
important news to the back 
burner in order to capitalize on 
only the juicy gossip elements of 
any story.
There is no doubt that the accu
sations against the President will 
have serious consequences if they 
prove to be true, and therefore 
coverage of this story is certainly 
of extreme importance. However, 
the media circus surrounding the 
story relegated other news, such 
as Pope John Paul IIs visit to 
Cuba, to virtual obscurity. Plus, 
the primary focus of the majority 
of media attention was not the 
fact that the President could have 
possibly perjured himself, it was 
about whether or not the Presi
dent had sexual relations with 
another adult.
This current Presidential scan
dal media blitz is not uncom
mon. We didnt get to hear very 
much of what Yassir Arafat said 
during his visit to the U.S. be
cause reporters were too busy 
grilling the President about his 
alleged sexual encounter. Also, 
most media sources pulled the 
majority of their crews out of Cuba 
during the Popes visit which 
proves that we did not get as much 
coverage of that historical event 
as we would have normally.
It is true that stories like these 
are complex, wrought with 
subtlety and uncertainty. How
ever, they comprise the world in 
which we live. The fact that a 30 
minute news show must use more 
than two minutes to explain a 
situation, or that the story may 
be happening on a different conti
nent, should not preclude it from 
being told.
Instead, most Americans are not 
given the chance to know about 
them because the rules of good 
journalism have been redefined. 
Journalism is becoming a stage 
upon which sex sells, brevity is an 
esteemed virtue, and taking the 
time to get an important story 
right rather than gloss it over is 
unheard of.
For example, local and national 
news crews descended upon CMU 
last Thursday in search of Michael 
Lewinsky, Monica Lewinskys 
brother. Faced with the fact that 
neither he nor his friends would 
comment on the situation (in 
which common sense tells us that 
Michael played no part whatso
ever), these media sources were 
forced to stop random students
and ask their opinions about 
the fact that they attend school 
with Monicas brother. Stooping 
to this level just to get a supposed 
angle on a story is reprehensible, 
and responsible journalists 
participating in this feeding 
frenzy are exhibiting inex
cusable behavior.
The story lies in the potential 
impeachment of the President, 
not in what the brother of the 
intern has to say about the possi
bility of his sisters affair with 
Bill Clinton.
The sting that comes with this 
kind of coverage is how every me
dia source made these sensational 
facets of the event their lead story. 
This is just one more example of 
the fact that every time we think 
the limits have been reached, we 
are proven wrong.
While the majority of media 
sources are pushing to cover the 
raciest version of the Clinton 
story, some news organizations 
are speaking out against the 
irresponsible reports. The 
Editor-in-Chief of The New York 
Times and a media analyst on an 
ABC nightly news broadcast have 
both publicly condemned the 
sensationalistic coverage of the 
past weekend, proving that the 
media is capable of policing itself. 
Now it only remains for more 
journalists to follow the prece
dent they have established.
The stories about the President 
still remain unsubstantiated. The 
rumors of the content of the 
conversation tapes have not been 
confirmed, and how this will all 
play out is still unknown. We do 
not know what really happened 
and neither does the press. But 
the extra time taken to hear from 
Lewinskys relatives and solicit 
movie stars opinions on the 
sex scandal could be time spent 
exploring other substantial 
news events.
Amid all of the performances 
and pandering of the media the 
truth has been lost: the truth 
about the stories we do not hear 
and even the ones we do. The 
solution to this problem lies with 
both the media and the public.
There is hardly a popular news 
source which has not bent to the 
new rides of reporting  those 
that dictate that the sensational 
story is the most important. How
ever, it is not too late to demand 
that these news sources change. 
It is not too late to switch the 
channel while you watch the tele
vision at night or to write to the 
editors of your newspaper.
We are at risk of losing our sense 
of place in the world. Already our 
view of what is important has 
been skewed. The question to 
which every baby boomer has an 
answer to is Where were you 
when you heard JFK was shot? 
Today though, more people are 
likely to know the answer to 
Where were you when you heard 
the OJ verdict? Hopefully we 
have not gotten so sidetracked.
Both the media and the 
American public need to realize 
that somewhere along the 
line, our priorities have been 
turned upside down, and we 
cannot wait any longer to seek 
out a remedy.

Freshman critiques meal plan
Lorelei Laird
By now, most CMU students have 
experienced the joy that is High
lander. Freshmen make tired jokes 
about mystery meat as they fill their 
plates; sophomores cast knowing 
glances at the freshmen while walk
ing to The O; juniors _________
and seniors have almost 
forgotten what the place 
looks like.
Granted, theres a rea
son for this  there are 
definitely some quality is
sues to be worked out, and 
Highlanders hours do not 
accommodate the often 
busy schedules students have. But 
amidst all the hubbub, no one seems to 
realize the worst thing about High
lander: The fact that we freshmen have 
to be there.
Technically, I dont suppose anyone 
is required to be there. Men with guns 
arent standing at the door, threaten
ing those attempting to escape with 
instant death. Students who find 
Highlanders fare unpalatable have 
their DineXpress and their budget
ing skills to fall back on. The truly
desperate among us can live off 
microwaved ramen and takeout 
pizza, like one friend of mine did his 
sophomore year. And, of course, you 
can always simply abstain from eat
ing (or try to).
But how much financial sense does 
that make? CMU costs big bucks. With 
room and board, it costs even bigger 
bucks. It doesnt take an economics 
major to figure out that its inefficient 
and wasteful to spend money on some[Dorms] facilitate a freshman's fa
miliarity with ... other students; High
lander facilitates a freshman's knowl
edge of local pizza places. "
thing that youre never going to use 
and even more wasteful to spend it 
twice on the same thing.
Even those first-year students with 
campus-owned apartments are stuck 
with all the facilities and none of the 
finances to cook their own meals, as 
theyre still required to buy all or part 
of the meal plan.
Yet not to go to Highlander is to 
waste much of your board payment. So 
freshmen, caught between a rock and 
a hard place, are being forced to shell
it out for a product theyre most likely 
going to use only because they have to, 
and thats tantamount to extortion.
It could be argued that requiring 
freshmen to buy the meal plan their 
first year, like requiring them to live on 
campus, is only an advantage for them. 
People who dont know Pittsburgh and 
are busy adjusting to the demands of a 
school that actually requires work may 
not be able to adequately feed them
selves, just as theyd have a hard time 
____________ finding adequate hous
ing.
But experience has 
taught me that people 
will almost always find 
time to fill their bellies. 
Neither is food terribly 
hard to find in this soci------------------ ety. (Imagine the real
estate agent-to-restaurant and grocery store ratio in Oakland 
alone.) If a freshmen is still adrift in the 
ocean that is CMU, fruitlessly search
ing for a Giant Eagle, there are Orien
tation Counselors practically falling all 
over each other to answer questions 
about where to find food.
Apartments, on the other hand, are 
harder to find and require the money, 
familiarity with the area, and house
keeping knowledge that the average 
high school graduate from (say)

Reverse sexism affects campus
Wllllam-Neil Guzy
Once upon a time, a naive 
CMU student felt that sex
ism was a problem only fe
males faced. I was that ide
alistic fool. My reality 
check was the result of my 
experiences with a sexist fe
male professor.
The majority of the profes
sors that I have come into 
contact with at CMU are good, 
and a few have been great. 
However, I have an extremely 
difficult time accepting a 
lower grade because of igno
rance and sexism on the part 
of the instructor.
This particular professor 
was teaching a course that 
revolved around class par
ticipation. Her behavior and 
response to certain male stu
dents as compared to female 
students was sexist. Her 
tone and demeanor com
pletely transformed when 
involved in discussions with 
students of different sexes.
A fairly large percentage 
of students final grades 
in my class was dependent 
upon their classroom partici
pation. I found the topics 
that were discussed in the 
course to be interesting, 
and I wanted to discuss 
them in the classroom re
gardless of their impact 
on my grade. However,
this desire began to change 
as the semeter proceeded.
The majority of the dis
cussion centered around the 
opinions of the students. 
When certain male 
students expressed opin
ions with which the profes
sor disagreed, she wouldnt 
hesitate to make a deroga
tory joke or insult them in 
front of 40 other students.
act extremely rudely to cer
tain male students. Her be
havior began to discourage 
classroom discussion. It 
produced an uncomfortable 
environment for certain 
male students to partici
pate in classroom discus
sions, whichwas detrimen
tal to their grades. It got to 
the point where I 
wasgoing to class and anFor example, if we were 
asked to express our views 
on a current issue such as 
abortion, and a male 
studentmade a logical argu
ment, she would simply dis
miss it with derogatory or 
sarcastic comments if she 
disagreed with it.
At first, I thought the 
professor was just rude to
wards everyone. However, 
as the semester pro
gressed, a pattern began 
to surface. She would reMary Tremonte/Tartan Junior Staff
swering only one question 
per class.
Her behavior towards fe
males, in general, was dif
ferent from that she showed 
to my male classmates and 
me. In the end, the course 
taught me a great deal more 
than what was on the sylla
bus. It taught me about ig
norance and discrimination.
Sexism is extremely diffi
cult to prove and even more 
difficult to stop. However, 
we as a student body need to
work against the ignorance 
that fuels sexism. Sexism of 
any kind is wrong. It centers 
around eliminating discrimi
nation based on gender.
The classroom is the 
professors domain. He or she 
is the boss and can be the 
deciding factor between 
grades. A students gender 
should play no role in 
this process.
Sexism targeted at males is 
a fairly new type of discrimi
nation. Men are taught to 
have a tighten-the-chin-strap 
mentality, which I did. How
ever, this professor was still 
sexist and had a lot of powgr.
During my time at CMII, I 
have seen little or no informa
tion concerning programs ft) 
combat sexism in the 
classroom and on campus. We 
as a student body need to fa
cilitate more of these pro
grams and encourage aware
ness throughout the Carnegie 
Mellon community. We 
need to become proactive and 
work to establish an envirqinment in which sexism is jfro 
longer ignored.
This is an issue whifh 
should be universally imp0i'* 
tant. Whether we are profes
sor or student, Republicanor 
Democrat, male or female, we 
all should work to end 
sexism. It is an issue rooted 
in equality.

OMU stress will send us to our deaths
Ellen Beldner
\ Oh, the bitter irony.
I thought that Carnegie Mellon could
 do nothing else to surprise me after I 
; witnessed the impenetrable Wean Hall 
| burst into flames and learned that a hot
 dog singlehandedly caused the downfall 
| of the entire Andrew network last fall.
But the newest in CMUs long line of 
1 Ha ha, sucks to be you jokes came in the 
! form of a Carnegie Mellon News article 
! that appeared on January 16.
! Researchers say stress reduction may 
' help fight cancer, screamed the second; page articles headline. As it turns out,
 Carnegie Mellon psychologist Sheldon 
| Cohen and University of Pittsburgh 
; Medical School immunologist Bruce 
: Rabin are optimistic that stress reduc; tion may be able to help our bodies fight 
I against cancer by boosting the bodys 
' immune system.
My gut reaction, like any self-respecting CMU students, was Sure, now they 
tell me. Here weve been, burrowing in 
pur computer clusters until five am, chug
ging down coffee, slurping on Jolt, and 
even sucking on tea bags (yes, it has 
v happened)  and little did we know that
it wasnt just monitor radiation turning 
our DNA into the cellular equivalent of 
mushy spaghetti.
Cohen is also the author of two stud
ies that linked stress to higher inci
dences of the common cold and found 
that people with diverse social roles and 
supportive social networks are less likely 
to catch colds. Which of course means 
that, in addition to giving us grapefruit
sized tumors, the hordes of sleepy stu
dents wandering around campus 
probably get stuffy noses and scratchy 
eyes more often than our lessstrained brethen.
There is a certain poetic justice, of 
course, in the fact that this research has 
come from CMU. We are consistently 
rated as having one of the highest stu
dent workloads in the country  a fact 
that any fifth-year architecture student 
will attest to, possibly while standing 
on the railing over Architects Leap. We 
work hard, and as CMU Campus Police 
have commented, many students here 
also play hard. Its not easy to relax 
here, between the papers, labs, and port
folios; so we pump ourselves full of 
Vivarin, suck in our ramen-and-0- 
food guts, and ignore our cravings for a 
semi-normal youth.
As much as Id like to point the finger 
at our loving professors (at least de
manding that they pay the increases in 
our health insurance premiums which
will surely result after Cigna or Humana 
discover that we graduated from this den 
of infamy and overwork), its not totally 
their fault. Sure, they may think its per
fectly natural and okay for us to spend six 
hours buried in an organic chemistry text
book each night, but I maintain that weve 
brought this health hazard on ourselves.
just- as  predrcted... cancer 1
James Mojonnier/ Tartan Art Co-Editor 
We all chose to come here  hell, I could 
have gone to the University of Florida and 
basked in the sunshine year-round for free. 
And moreover, since were far too timecrunched to rise up in an armed insurrec
tion against CMUs administration, our 
quickly mutating cells will just have to 
stay put and hush up until we read the next 
300 pages of Dickens Our Mutual Friend.
The next question, of course, is this: If its 
our fault that were all going to have to start 
pulling out malignant tumors between our 
8:30 physics recitations and 9:30 Super 
Duper Psycho Butt-Kicking Calc lecture, 
what can we do to try to prevent it?
The power is ours, as Captain Planet or 
some other similarly cheesy cartoon charac
ter would say. So instead of inhaling some 
more of those yummy Prismacolor marker 
fumes during your next free time (which, 
according to my calculations, should occur 
sometime in early March), try a little R&R. 
Find someone to give you a massage (ask 
your RA if you cant find anyone else; it 
makes them feel useful). Take a walk in 
Schenley Park. Burn that textbook from 
last semesters Econometrics course that 
took your QPA from a 3.72 to a 0.31. De
mand that one of your off-campus friends 
purchase a dog or cat and then go pet it.
So as CMUs researchers forge ahead, pullingECE majors from the WeanHall computer 
clusters to run biopsies, we can all rest as
sured that the more Cohen and Rabin dis
cover about stress role in pummeling the 
immune system, the more well realize that 
extra life insurance is probably going to be the 
best investment we can make in our futures.

Columnist questions 
Presidents priorities
Dave Liber
?M When I sat down to reflect on 
1:1'the news for this week, I hoped I 
hfyould be able to ignore all the 
hews coming from inside the 
 'beltway about President Clintons 
inability to keep his fly zipped in 
'-front of young White House insterns. I truly did want to think 
'"about something pointed and 
meaningful like civil rights, but, 
alas, my thoughts of sex, corrup
tion, and power are too great to 
-'ignore. So I wish to address what 
kIhas become the biggest scandal of 
the Clinton presidency.
*TI Like most Americans, I truly do 
 'hot give a damn whether or not 
'President Clinton had sex with 
--Ms. Lewinsky. Ill admit I cer' tainly do not find her attractive, 
: but that has nothing to do with it. 
If Bill feels that he has the right to 
.-go around propositioning all in"fcerested interns then, fine, I have 
no problem with that. It keeps his 
. mind busy and keeps him from 
. .being sexually frustrated.
(r, I do not even have a problem 
with the fact that he would be 
jiaving an illicit affair while mar
ried. If Hillary is fine with it, 
. ihen, so be it.
However, I do, as it seems most 
of America does, have a problem 
(with Clinton ifhehas tried to hinder 
the Whitewater or Paula Jones 
..investigations by suborning per(ury or obstructingjustice, and that 
,, ,is what is truly at the heart of this 
r, .matter. It is embarrassing for me 
.as an American to have a president
who is getting offin the Oval Office 
and allowing it to leak out to the 
media. Lets face it, Clinton just 
does not have the tact that Presi
dent Kennedy had in keeping his 
affairs secret and hidden, which is 
the proper way for one to have 
mistresses (unless you are a 
French president, and then, who 
cares who knows?)
But I am more than willing to 
overlook Clintons sexual history 
and affairs  I really dont want 
to think about Bill having sex. I 
am not willing and I believe most 
Americans are not willing to for
give a President who may have 
clearly violated the law.
Ifitis true that President Clinton 
suborned peijury and obstructed 
justice, then the only proper action 
is for him to resign the Presidency. 
Nixon had the common courtesy to 
do so after having been found to 
haveobstructedjustice, and Clinton 
should be no different. In a few 
days, America will know how far 
this affair has gone and what, if 
any, illegal actions were taken by 
the President.
I ask though, for the sake of our 
national dignity, that if President 
Clinton did obstruct j ustice, which 
is a violation of federal law, he 
should resign. It is the only true 
and proper thing to do, and if he 
has any self-respect, he will.
If, however, these allegations 
do prove false, then I would ask 
Americans to get on with their 
lives and leave Bill alone to have 
his fun with some other White 
House intern.

Meal plan cheats freshmen
HIGHLANDER, from page 6
Poughkeepsie, New York 
doesnt have. Residence halls 
facilitate a freshmans famil
iarity with the school and 
withother students; High
lander facilitates a freshmans 
knowledge of local pizza 
places. Theres no practical 
reason to require that fresh
men buy the meal plan other 
than the business it may get 
the school.
That business, apparently, 
is good. Join me for a mo
ment as I journey through 
the Mystical World of Math. 
According to the official CMU
website, the __________
board portion of 
the room and 
board payment 
for the 1996-97 
school year here 
at CMU is $2,300.
(Figures for this 
year werent ^ 
available, but I 
can only assume it went up if 
it changed at all, since tu
ition went up.)
Some of that may be taken 
up with non-food-related ex
penses, but Im assuming 
most of it goes toward food.
Now, if a student is on the 
six-meals-a-week-and-$45- 
DineXpress plan, the small
est number of Highlander 
meals theyll let on-campus 
freshmen get away with, thats 
a little less than $765 a se
mester in a 17-week semester 
that goes to DineXpress (I 
should subtract a small 
amount for breaks, but I dont 
kno\y exactly how much). 
Double that amount and its
$1,530 for the whole year. 
That leaves about $770 of 
the payment to cover 
Highlander visits and what
ever other expenses are cov
ered by board.
Such a small amount 
wouldnt cover six visits a 
week (at an average of five 
dollars a visit) for the whole 
school year  However, re
duce the number of visits by 
half, and the school shows 
a clear profit. The same 
seems to be true for other 
meal plans, with more High
lander visits per week equal
ing more profit.
Theres no practical reason to 
require that freshmen buy the 
meal plan other than the busi
ness it may get the school. 
In short, The Powers 
That Be are banking on 
your not going.
Not to say that theres an 
evil conspiracy to suck you 
dry, but if they make you 
buy Highlander block meals
nature and the facts are 
against it.
Making freshmen buy the meal 
plan isnt a guaranteed way to 
make a profit, but its certainly 
more likely to make a profit than 
not making anyone buy it.
Even if the requirement were 
lifted, I doubt that Highlander 
would become a ghost town over
night. Food from the University 
Center gets boring and not ev
eryone has a kitchen or an incli
nation towards cooking. Indeed, 
I know plenty of people with 
kitchens who freely choose to go.
But taking peoples choices 
away, especially about some

Columnist questions selection of NHL top 50
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
The Hockey News (THN) recently named 
the Top 50 NHL players of all time. 
Thats a lot of players to choose from, 
considering that guys started lacing up 
the skates on a little pond in Canada 
over 100 years ago.
Of course, THN named Wayne Gretzky 
the number one player in history. Why 
not? He holds almost every offensive 
record in the history of the game, won 
four Cups in five years with the Oilers, 
was nine times an MVP and, at 36, has 
played in professional hockey for 19 years 
and racked up 874 goals and 1,873 as
sists. But do records make the man?
Naming the leader of this definitive 
list does not come without controversy. 
The man who was ranked second should 
have surged ahead to first. That man is 
Bobby Orr.
Gretz was a shrimp when he came into 
the game. He said himself that he looked 
like that kid who bags your groceries. 
But, at age 16, he scored 182 points in 
his first season of Junior A hockey in 
Canada. He only weighed 161 pounds 
when he entered professional hockey. 
They called him Big Bird and Pencil  
then he blew everyone away.
Orr played 12 NHL seasons, until his 
knees were like bags of feathers. In his 
first championship game in Canada as a
Bantam, when the scouts first caught 
wind of him, he played 58 of the 60 
minutes. He was serving time in the 
penalty box for the only two minutes 
that he missed. He signed his rights to 
the Bruins when he was 13. In his first 
professional game at 17, Mr. Hockey 
himself (number three in the THN poll), 
Gordie Howe, knocked him on his ass. 
Howe wanted to let the youngster know 
that this wasnt kids stuff any more.
Orr was a quick study. He won rookie 
of the year in 1967, and then won eight 
straight Norris trophies for best 
defenseman in the league. He made eight 
first-team All-Star competitions, before 
the players were chosen by the fans and 
before the game was made into the me
dia spectacle that it became this year.
In 657 games, he had 270 goals, 645 
assists, and almost 1,000 penalty min
utes, again  before a lot of the crappy, 
strict rules that are in the books today. 
No one has ever accused Orr of being 
nice on the ice. He was a bulldog, never 
backing down from swearing at the refs 
or beating the hell out of someone com
ing into his zone. He was fearless, and 
players respected him for that. While 
everyone is in awe of Gretzkys ability, 
no one will ever say that he could stand 
on his own in a fight. Thats because he 
doesnt, wont, cant fight. Not to say 
that fighting is a measure of a man, but 
when it comes down to it in hockey, your 
ball size is just as important as your 
scoring.
Orr was a bad boy. Gretzky married 
the movie star and has sparkling blue 
eyes and blonde hair. He is an angel. I 
like devils more.
One night, clad in a stolen doctors 
gown, Orr abducted Phil Esposito (num
ber 18 in THiVs-poll) from Mass. Gen
eral, where he was recovering from ligaMatt Blum/Tartan Junior Staff
ment damage. He wheeled him on his 
hospital bed through the streets of Boston so that Espo could join the rest of the 
team at their favorite bar. Orr was the 
naughty head of pranksters in the Lunch 
Pail Gang of determined players that 
dominated hockey in the early 70s: the 
Big Bad Bruins.
In 1976, with knees of mush, Orr lead 
his country to victory in the infamous 
Canada Cup series against the Soviets. 
He was named Most Outstanding 
Player in a tournament where he 
couldnt even practice with the team 
because of the strain on his body and 
after each game, he would sit for houis 
icing his knees with six or seven bags at 
a time.
Orr gave us the most memorable mo
ment of Stanley Cup scoring history, & 
vision that is etched forever in our minds. 
The defenseman in mid-air, flying past 
the Blues net, having scored the win
ning goal of the 1969-70 Stanley Cup 
finals. His hands outstretched and his 
eyes wide open. He is falling down into 
history. He was the scoring leader of the 
entire league that year  yes  the 
defenseman. Sports Illustrated named 
him Man of the Year.
He was 31 when they inducted him into 
the Hall of Fame, the youngest inductee 
ever. Orr was reclusive with the press, 
nasty with refs, had  terrible mean 
streak,and was a notorious jokester - 
but he was the most determined and 
hard-working player that the game has 
ever known. I love him for it. Bobby Orr 
will always be my number one man.
Jessica Strelitz is a senior professional 
writing major who encourages tedm 
bonding through very late nights, Molson 
Ice,and talking about what defensemen 
think about on the bench during a game.
Basketball overcomes loss at Hopkins to beat Brandis
go four deep on their bench and 
still get consistent play in relief 
of starters.
The team cruised for the rest of 
the second half, flirting with a 20 
point lead a few times. Defen
sively CMU continued to shut 
down Brandis, who looked 
outmatched for most of the game. 
Throughout the second half there 
were a high number of fouls and 
a few strange calls from the offi
cials, however Carnegie Mellon 
ended the game as strongly as
they began it. CMU racked up 76 
points despite lacking the touch 
from three point range that had 
helped them so much in the 
Kenyon game.
The win also gave the team 
confidence that they could finish 
strongly and improve their record 
in the UAA through the second 
half of the season. Carnegie 
Mellon retumes to action against 
New York University at home on 
January 25 and then will hit the 
road for its next four games.

violation the next time down the 
court by tough defense from CMU. 
A three-point shot from fresh
man guard David Burns and an
other basket from McNutt gave 
Carnegie Mellon an 18-9 lead. 
At this point Brandeis had totally lost control over any mo
mentum that it may have had. 
With CMU having doubled their 
scoring output through the first 
ten minutes of th game, 
Brandeis called a timeout.
For the rest of the half CMU 
continued its dominance over the 
Brandeis team. Senior guard 
LaDale Widmeyer ran the floor 
well for the Tartans, distributing 
the ball well, particularly on fast 
breaks. In addition to his run
ning the offense, the front court
of Bowersox, McNutt, and senior 
forward and co-captain Andy 
Sofish shot nine of 13 and com
bined for 18 of CMUs 31 firsthalf points. Carnegie Mellon was 
able to continue to stifle the 
Judges offense despite another 
Brandeis timeout.
The Tartans went into the sec
ond half with a 31-19 point lead 
from the first half. Unfortunately, 
less than two minutes into the 
half McNutt received an elbow to 
the nose and went down under
the Brandeis basket. ...I didnt 
break my nose. I might have 
cracked the bone in my nose, but 
they cant be certain of that with
out X-rays, said McNutt. The 
injury forced McNutt to leave the 
game. However, it was not so 
serious that if Carnegie Mellon 
had not been in control McNutt 
could have returned.
After the loss of McNutt, the 
team continued to roll ahead in 
large part to strong bench play. 
The Tartans are typically able to

Stunning Bronco victory signals end of era
Pigskin Pundit
=<! SA BREtr Bnwwmw
When Denver lost Super Bowl 
XIV 55-10, a huge Broncos fan 
^amed Jason in my eighth grade 
J/jJass was equally crushed. A 
(#roncos cap was part of his ev^i-yday uniform and John Elway 
.was to him what John Wayne 
; was to Westerns. After the game, 
Jason was teased unmercif\illy- Id later find out that 
(Jason had lost an eye 
ground that time and.
unable to play foot
ball because of self
doubt, I imagine he 
jved that season 
^through his team.
rj Like Jason, half 
he fans in the 
ague would get 
used to that 
.grushed feeling. Super 
-owl XXV was close, as 
.ills lost 20-19 on a missed last 
second field goal. But when the 
_NFC piled up wins eight through 
13 in the streak, the big game 
^became a well known ritual 
.^yent: big companies shell out 
for funny commercials, big half
time show gets planned, big-time 
gop singer does the national an-them, and the AFC is sacrificed 
.to the big bad NFC. In a strange 
Away this was good, people knew 
$yhat to expect.
As the streak grew, Super Bowls 
^ecame less about the Super Bowl 
nd more about parties. When 
everyone knew who was going to 
-win, who cared about game plans, 
.key plays, and player heroics. 
^Commercials, half-time show, and 
.making fun of players became 
more palatable party conversa
tion. Such was the mood at the
Super Bowl party I attended. 
(Names have been withheld to 
protect anyone who wasnt funny.)
Why are they playing old 
songs? someone cried at the 
Motown half-time show. Show 
the little dance, another partygoer yelled when Antonio Free
man shook his thing after his 
second touchdown. How big is 
Gilbert Brown really? Just 345
But early on during the ritual, 
things became shockingly unfa
miliar. A fan from Wisconsin 
yelled Breyeag-aaaah! as the 
Packers went down 17-7 in the 
second quarter; giving a voice to 
my feeling of confusion. This 
was supposed to be a party. Its 
supposed to be over by half-time 
so we can talk about the com
mercials more and go to the
'. V'
pounds; I dont buy it. The man 
doesnt have ears, he has small 
portholes.
Ripping on John Elway has al
ways been a fan favorite, but these 
cuts were rather original. The 
party-goers imagined what he was 
like in high school, saying he was 
the too rich to be a hick type of 
guy. Thats another guy that I 
hated in high school, someone 
said after Bronco Bill Romanowski 
said, I was so sick of telling [the 
Packers] how good they were [that] 
I wanted to puke.

fridge for beer during play. Now 
the Broncos had ruined it by 
making a game out of the Super 
Bowl. Casual football followers 
and fair-weather fans must have 
been pissed.
For diehard fans, its hard to 
pick a favorite between the Bron
cos and Packers. According to a 
Wisconsin native, people treated 
the game like a holiday. Fans 
living near Green Bay, the only 
NFL team owned by a public 
community, illuminated their 
houses in green and gold lights
for the game. But the Broncos 
and their fans have always had a 
lot of heart.
In the 80s, a fan once lived on 
top of a billboard, swearing not to 
come down until the team won a 
Super Bowl. In the first round of 
the draft last year, Denver se
lected John Mobly from the small 
college of Kutztown. They once 
drafted a defensive linemen who 
was deaf. Its not hard to see why 
a player and fan like Jason 
would idolize the team.
For some fans, rooting 
for a losing team has al
ways been a unique form of 
masochism. Billy Crystal 
goes to Clipper games while 
every other celebrity in L.A. 
watches the Lakers. Defying con
ventional wisdom, ESPNs Chris 
Berman eagerly picked 
Buffalo to win in their 
four consecutive Super 
Bowls. Perhaps most 
inexplicably, despite 
having another winner 
in town, New Yorkers con
tinue to attend Mets 
games. For great fans and 
great champions, there is 
no bigger thrill than riding a 
team from the bottom all the 
way to the top.
What happened to Jason? Ja
son got a glass eye, got back in 
football, and helped his team win 
a state championship his junior 
year. And what did the Broncos 
do? After being dethroned as the 
biggest Super Bowl losers by the 
Bills, they rebuilt. Then they 
rebounded from last years play
off debacle. They used leagues 
smallest offensive line pushed 
around the largest defensive on 
to the tune of four rushing touch
downs. I imagine somewhere 
Jason is cheering. Somewhere, 
everywhere, true fans must be 
cheering too.

**Hula played a strong game and has 
rgeen showing added confidence as the 
^ar has progressed. His defensive partper, sophomore Cliff Brangwynne, motii vated the team with his vocal encourj agement and tenacious play. Sophomore 
! Doreen Mulryan and freshman Scott 
Schneider both played solidly for the 
i third line and saw a lot of shifts in the 
jgame Friday. Mulryan got even more
 time on Saturday.
| Im happy, I actually touched the puck 
j and was comfortable out there. The more 
\ I play, the more I get used to it, said 
i Mulryan.
! Saturday night CMU faced UPJ. The 
; Tartans were in great spirits and it 
I showed. On his first shift, Grzywacz 
| continued where he had left off the night 
before and scored, assisted by Hula.
Again, the Tartans were 
fired up. Defenseman 
Dave Mitzel, sophomore 
Brandon Paluzzi and 
Grzywacz all played physi
cal games.
Its [Brangwynne]. Hes 
so into it. Its motivating, 
when one guy gets going 
that, is all that you need, 
said Mitzel about his sud
den burst of physicality 
against the larger UPJ 
team. But CMU also 
played heads-up as Ebert 
continued smart play by 
maintaining control and 
drawing two penalties in 
the first period alone.
In the second, CMU was 
down early because of a 
holding call on Gryzwacz, 
when Berkowitz broke j^e Tartans 
away from the pack and 
sprinted down the near boards to score 
short handed only second into the pen
alty kill. Later, Duncan drew a high 
stick along the middle boards, setting 
up a CMU power play. Grzywacz, fed by
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
steal the puck from enemy attackers and head up ice.
Jander and Brangwynne, set a slap shot 
that got by the UPJ keeper.
Adam Duncan who has struggled in 
both games to get the puck in the net said,
Sometimes they go in and sometimes
they dont, [Grzywacz] is 
hot right now.
UPJ only managed six 
shots in the first two peri
ods. Defense was clearly 
key. It felt like we 
(defensemen) controlled 
the tempo of both games, 
said Hula. Its been fun 
and its been a long time 
since its been like that. 
CMU started out the 
third down two 
defenseman, Hula and 
Voulgaris, who were in the 
box for late penalties in 
the second. Brangwynne 
had left the game because 
of a deep laceration to his 
foot that hed suffered 
sometime in the second pe
riod. He later received 11 
stitches and is expected to 
be back next weekend. But 
the team held on, making an all over 
effort. Berkowitz added another power 
play goal, this time from Voulgaris, and 
Jander follow him ten second later by 
ramming in his own goal assisted by
Paluzzi. The game ended, 5-0 CMU.
Jon Kliegman, who played flawlessly 
in goal with 13 saves said I think this 
is a great start to our season. Last 
semester is behind us and this 
semester is all ours.
[Kliegman and Min] both were out
standing for us this weekend. They 
were able to maintain their focus 
throughout the game, even though the 
other teams werent getting off many 
shots. They saved our butts a couple of 
times with some spectacular saves, said 
Williams about the goaltending.
Williams was also impressed with how 
the Tartans managed to keep the play in 
the offensive zone all weekend. The 
third and fourth lines played well when 
called upon, creating turnovers, moving 
the puck, and checking well, he said. 
We allowed less than 30 shots total, 
allowed only one goal combined (in two 
games), and scored shorthanded in each 
game this weekend. We played as a 
team.

CMU glides past 
hapless opponent
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Rarely is there an exhibition 
of such complete domination as 
was the case on Saturday when 
the Carnegie Mellon swim team 
demolished Washington and 
Jefferson College. The Tartan 
men and women combined to 
win 21 out of 22 events, grab
bing both first and second place 
in 14 events and taking an astoundingfirst, second, and third 
place in eight events.
[The meet] was not as com
petitive as we wanted, Coach 
David Belowich said. The 
Washington and Jefferson 
team was simply outnum
bered, under prepared, and 
outmatched. However, given 
the fact that W&J only had 
eight men swimmers, they re
ally didnt stand a chance,
records, carrying the mens 
team to a 111-71 victory. Fresh
men George Heidinger and Ja
son Striner and sophomore Eric 
Melymuk all captured first 
place in their respective races, 
highlighting an exceptionally 
strong year for CMU under
classmen. The outmatched 
Washington and Jefferson team 
was not able to finish first in 
any mens event.
The road ahead for CMU, 
while full of promise, is by no 
means easy. They swim against 
Westminster College this Fri
day and close out the regular 
season against West Virginia 
Wesleyan College this Satur
day. Carnegie Mellon lost to 
Westminster last year and West 
Virginia beat Westminster ear
lier in the season, so the final 
dual meets of the season should 
serve to challenge the team to

said senior Jake McGuire.
The main point of the meet 
was to stay focused on our swims 
and get some good times, said 
freshman Jason Striner.
Saturdays 121-74 victory 
brought the womens team record 
to 44 and put them in position 
to finish the season at or above 
.500 for the first time ever.
This years womens team is 
the strongest Carnegie Mellon 
has ever seen, said junior 
Michelle Kondo.
Many Tartan women swam 
personal bests versus Washing
ton and Jefferson, setting three 
more womens pool records in 
the process. Freshman Melissa 
Schmelzer broke the record in 
the 1000m Freestyle with a time 
ofl0:45.10. Kondo swam 4:51.85 
in the 400m Individual Medley 
and freshman Julie Tseng set 
the mark in the 500 Freestyle 
with a 5:19.53.
The record-setting and domi
nation continued on the mens 
side. McGuire, sophomore Mike 
Robinson, and freshman 
Jonathan Alpert each set pool
finish well and propel it into 
the UAA Championships on a 
good note.
We have our work cut out for 
us, said sophomore Catherine 
Nguyen. Were swimming re
ally fast now, and if we can 
improve even more, the cham
pionships should go very well.
Belowich is extremely happy 
with the Tartans recent per
formances. Theyre swimming 
fast while training hard. The 
mens team is currently 6-2 
and, with two dual meets left, 
has the opportunity to finish 
the year with one of the best 
records for a mens team in a 
decade. To highlight the sea
son, as many as six Tartan 
swimmers are in the running 
to qualify for the national cham
pionships, the most for a CMU 
swim team in years.
The team is at the end of its 
peak training period and will 
soon begin to rest for the Cham
pionships. They will cut back 
on weightlifting and limit the 
practices to fewer laps and

Women lose third straight game athome against Brandis
Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Co-Editor 
The Tartan women huddle up before heading into action on Friday night.
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Contributing Editor
At the beginning of the first half of 
Fridays womens basketball game 
against UAA opponent Brandeis Uni
versity, it looked like it was going to be 
an easy night for the Tartans. Senior 
forward Katie OLeary snatched the 
Brandeis tip-off and drove straight to 
the hoop to put CMU on the board with 
the first points of the game. From there, 
however, the game became much more 
of an uphill battle for the women as 
Brandeis slowly slipped past them to 
assume control of the game. CMU ral
lied hard, but Brandeis managed to fend 
them off long enough to hand the Tar
tans a 53-55 loss.
The game bogged down after OLearys 
opening hoop, as both teams clamped 
down hard under the hoop, forcing a lot 
of perimeter passing as players searched 
for openings. With just under 11 min
utes remaining in the half, sophomore 
forward Hilary Harris made a bucket to 
give the Tartans a 16-13 advantage, 
ending a four-minute scoring drought. 
The action then raged up and down the 
court, as neither team managed to con
vert scoring opportunities. The Tartans 
then went on a seven-minute skid, al
lowing Brandeis to slowly change the 
face of the scoreboard. A pair of layups 
and a free-throw let the Judges tie the 
score at 18-18 with less than six min
utes on the clock, and they kept going 
from there. By the time senior guard 
Marcelle Steele sunk her fast-break 
layup with 1:16 left in the half, Brandeis 
had established a strong lead at 20-26. 
CMU finished the half with a free throw 
and a three-pointer by junior forward 
Amanda Tishkoff, but Brandeis an
swered with four points of its own, send
ing the Tartans to the locker room facing 
a 24-29 deficit. Free-throws were the 
name of the game in the first half, as 
both teams took 15 free-throw shots  
Brandeis sunk eight, while CMU buried 
only six.
The Tartans started the second half 
with authority, as baskets by OLeary 
and sophomore forward Kristy Thomas 
gave CMU the lead again, 30-29. The 
Judges quickly remedied that situation 
by putting away seven points in under 
three minutes. The teams began trading 
layups again  CMU seemed to have 
trouble breaking through the Brandeis
defense, as many Tartan shots were 
hurried by the shot clock. Midway 
through the half, the Tartans went on 
their own scoring streak, holding the 
Judges scoreless for almost seven min
utes while CMU tallied nine points to 
retake the lead, 47-45. But Brandeis 
kept hammering away, making shot afJ 
ter shot while CMU had several score
less drives, allowing Brandeis to once 
again claim the lead at 47-55. A threepointer by sophomore forward Samantha 
Majernik closed the gap to 50-55, and 
another by freshman point guard Lauren 
Petruzzi made it 53-55  a one-basket 
game with only 1:06 remaining.
Again, CMU found themselves stopped 
at the hoop as they passed around the 
perimeter looking for a hole in the 
Brandeis defense. The Tartans missed 
a layup and a three-pointer, and the 
last-second shot by Petruzzi was swat
ted into the stands to allow Brandeis to 
escape, leaving the Tartans with a 53- 
55 loss.
I just think were a team that needs to 
play better together, said coach Gen 
Seidl. On the most part ... we were 
composed, she said. [We just] dont

Men win first UAA game of the year
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
The CMU mens hoop squad 
played two UAA opponents this 
week in an attempt to boost their 
position in the conference, but 
had mixed results, splitting their 
two games. Last Sunday the team 
started the week in Baltimore 
with a loss to John Hopkins Uni
versity, 65-47. Rebounding the
loss, Carnegie Mellon successfully 
hosted Brandeis University on 
Friday, walking away with a 76- 
57 victory. The win on Friday 
marked the first win for the Tar
tans against a UAA opponent this 
season, and helped to prevent 
them from gaining the dubious 
distinction of being in last place.
Hopkins was CMUs fourth 
UAA opponent of the year, but 
only provided the Tartans with

more disappointment as they lost 
by a large margin. The first 
half is what cost us the Hopkins 
game. No one was shooting very 
well and we were just making a 
lot of stupid mistakes. We fell 
into a big hole at half, and even 
though we played some excel
lent basketball in the second half, 
we werent able to overcome the 
big halftime deficit, said junior 
forward Brad McNutt. A strong 
second half still wasnt enough 
for the team to come back. De
spite the fact that they lost, 
McNutt felt that they could have 
beaten Hopkins.
Last Friday CMU returned home 
to play Brandeis University before 
a full house. Cominginto the game, 
CMU and Brandeis held in com
mon a winless record in the UAA 
One team had to win and in doing 
so lift themselves from the bottom 
of the standings in the conference. 
The Tartans starting lineup did 
not include senior forward and 
co-captain Colin Shaunnessey 
because of an injury he had previ
ously sustained. However, 
Shaunnessey would play during 
the game, and when he did he 
brought his physical presence to 
the court for CMU.
From the start of the game 
Carnegie Mellon seemed to be in 
control. Brandeis lacked a true 
center, and at most positions CMU 
held a slight height advantage. In 
the opening minutes the teams 
traded points,' and it became obvi
ous that the game was going to be 
fairly physical. CMU was able to 
jump out to an early 9-5 lead with 
16 minutes left in the half, but, 
began to struggle on offense briefly 
after that. For the next four min
utes the Tartans went without a 
field goal. Brandeis ran a half 
court trap and was able to close 
the gap and tie the game up dur
ing that period, but their own of
fensive troubles prevented them 
from pulling ahead.
Finally McNutt was able to hit 
a shot from close to the basket to 
give the Tartans an 11-9 lead. 
CMU stopped Brandeis the 
next time down the court and 
returned to offense. McNutt col
lected a defensive the points 
coming when he hit another shot 
to extend the Tartans lead. The 
lead would be the only one that 
CMU would need for the rest of 
the game. Brandeis was forced 
into committing a 35-second clock

Play resumed for the second 
half of the Carnegie Mellon ice 
hockey season this past weekend, 
and, sparked by the scoring bar
rage of sophomore winger 
Przemyslaw (PJ) Grzywacz, the 
team took back-to-back victories. 
They defeated California Univer
sity of Pennsylvania (CUP) 6-1 
and shut out University of 
Pittsburg at Johnstown (UPJ) 5- 
0. The team is now 4-4-1 in divi
sion play and 4-6-1 overall.
Grzywacz had five goals and 
one assist for the weekend. He 
was joined in scoring by seniors 
Derek Jander, who had two, Scott 
Fitzgerald and defenseman Paul 
Voulgaris, who each had one and 
grad student Jonathan Berkowitz, 
who added a pair of goals, one 
shorthanded, and two assists.
The team was missing a few

Reading, writing, and ... robotics?
Beside the everyday calculus, biology, 
and English classes at a typical high 
school, students at Taylor Allderdice High 
School in Squirrel Hill now have the 
opportunity to learn more about robotics 
and engineering, with the help of Carn
egie Mellons Robotics Institute.
This year, the Robotics Institute is 
sponsoring a team of approximately 30 
students from Taylor Allderdice who 
will compete in the seventh annual For 
Inspiration and Recognition of Science 
and Technology (FIRST) competition. 
This national robotics competition gives 
teams of students from around the coun
try six weeks to build a robot, out of 
specified materials, which is capable of 
completing a certain task. The finished 
robots re then judged as they compete 
at the regional and national level against 
other teams robots.
At this years competitions, the ro
bots are challenged with the task of 
placing 20-inch diameter balls inside a 
goal structure while competing with 
two other robots. The structure con
sists of a large cylinder with three 
slanted rails coming out of its sides, 
and points are awarded based on where 
the balls are placed in the structure. 
The robots are built from plywood, alu
minum rods, motors, and electronics, 
among other materials. They can be up 
to four feet tall with a 36-inch by 30- 
inch base and weigh up to 130 pounds.
We are trying to let the stu
dents build and design as much 
as they can on their own, said 
Kim Shillcutt, a doctoral stu
dent in the Robotics Insti
tute and one of the gradu
ate student volunteers as
sisting the high school 
team. The students have 
been working on the 
project for a little over a 
week. They have now de
signed the robot and will 
soon begin building it. They 
work mostly after school on 
the project, for a few hours 
at least three or four days 
each week, and graduate 
students, like Shillcutt 
and Mike Montemerlo, a 
first-year doctoral stu
dent in robotics, vol
unteer their time to 
meet with the students 
and assist them with 
their project.
Its our goal to help [the 
Taylor Allderdice team] build 
the best robot they can, said 
Montemerlo. It is really their 
effort, we just facilitate it. By 
building the robot themselves, 
they learn more and have more 
fun. They develop a connection with 
the robot, he said. As an electrical

the electrical components of the robot, 
making sure the designs are feasible

portunity to provide children in 
three through 12 with a foundation of 
knowledge which will be useful should 
the students decide to study architec
ture at the college level.
We try and teach them not really 
about buildings, but how to think about 
buildings, said Hilary Ward, a fifthyear architecture student who has 
served as an instructor for the program 
since last semester.
The program, which began again in 
1996 after a one-year hiatus, runs in 
ten-week sessions each semester 
and offers classes with a limit of 
15 students per class and a $140 
fee per student.
There are no real require
ments, said Ward. The kids are 
either interested in drawing or 
... construction materials. 
Despite the lack of require
ments, many of the children 
display talent at an early age. 
Some of the kids really show 
good promise of coming to [col

fifth-year architecture student who 
has served in various capacities 
in the Architecture for Children 
program, including instructor 
and administrator, since her

amazing work.... A few 
years ago, this girl was 
building these abstract 
models in the seventh 
grade.... I would say thats

work, she said.
This semester, because 
of a lack of interest at 
other levels, only the fifthand sixth-grade class is 
available. The class is be
ing taught by Ward, Jes
sica Klehr, a CMU alum 
and local architect, and 
Shalini Vajjhala, a sopho

volunteer for the program. 
Students at all levels in the 
Architecture for Children program 
are exposed to lessons in drawing, 
model making, and computer mod
eling, according to Cross. Students in 
the fifth- and sixth-grade class also learn 
about landmarks.

Historian examines nature of artists books
The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  26 January 1998
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The School of Arts lecture series began 
last Thursday in McConomy Auditorium 
with Johanna Drucker, a visiting lec
turer and associate professor of art his
tory at Yale. Druckers lecture dealt with 
the nature of books in art and the ways in 
which they relate to technological envi
ronments. After speaking on the impor
tance of books in life, she gave an over
view of the history of artist books.
It is ... a principle work of art by an 
artist who believes the book form is the 
only form which the art can take, said 
Drucker about her personal definition of 
an artists book. In addition, she explained 
that unlike books of plain text, an artist 
book has no introduction and no fly leaf. 
It begins immediately with art.
Drucker believes an artist book is a 
subset of books, and explained that this 
is important because of the value society 
gives to books. She cited the various 
topics to which we dedicate books: life, 
law, nature, relation, and divinity.
Her artist book history overview be
gan with slide-projection examples from 
William Blake and William Morris. 
Blakes American Prophecy, incorporates
social and personal terms and conse
quently embodies art, politics, and spirit.
Morris, whose work deals with the 
impact of industrialization on 
society while reviving the ar
tistic styles and elaborate de
tails of the Medieval period, 
creates a strong paradox with 
his artist books. While Mor
ris art touches upon the is
sues of the century, Drucker 
said she believes it is out of 
sync with the times because 
of its gilded textures and luxu
rious ornamentation.
Drucker then spoke of the 
French Symbolists who began 
using the poem as a spatial 
configuration and the artist 
books of the early 20th cen
tury. By viewing their work, 
the audience was able to see 
how the artists of the Russian 
avant-garde printed their art 
books as cheaply as possible.
The work of this group focused 
on social resistance.
The book is now a non-standard form, 
dealing with unconventional things. It 
has a dual identity, she said. With the 
influx of technology into the everyday
lives of the public, particularly in the 
form of radio, Drucker believed the pur
pose of the book was going through a

transformation in the early 1900s.
She then focused on the 1960s, saying 
that during this time, minimalism and 
pop art were taking the art world by
storm. Books began focusing on the 
idea and importance of objects by using 
modern imagery.
When she finished her brief his
tory of art books, Drucker spoke 
about the art books of today and 
how they have been impacted by 
those of the past.
Space has both physical and 
conceptual importance. Two books 
of the same size can have differ
ent implications because of the 
way space is used, she said.
The audience was able to view 
works that create illusions, such 
as a sense of time or the feeling of 
viewing the book from a specific 
position, byjudicious use of space. 
Drucker also showed the ways in 
which holes and space on a page 
can connect preceding and follow
ing pages with each other.
Before opening the lecture to 
questions, Drucker presented 
slides of a few artist books of her 
own, and she then spoke of the 
ways in which technology is im
pacting this art form.

biweekly on Thursdays at 5 pm. For more

Picture this: an adult asks eight-yearold Sanford Rivers what he wants to be 
when he grows up. Little Sanford an
swers, Tm going to be CMUs assistant 
vice president for enrollment during the 
weekday, but Ill keep my weekends free 
so I can also be an NFL official.
At any age, that's not exactly what 
one would expect someone to say 
about their professional aspirations, 
but those two occupations are the 
positions which Rivers holds cur
rently. The Tartan caught up with 
him before the Super Bowl to get his 
opinions on the balance of two very 
different jobs, the highs and lows of 
an administrators racquetball 
game and an inside look at what it 
really means to be an NFL official.
The Tartan: So, have you ever 
been hit on the field?
Sanford Rivers: Have I ever been 
hit before? Well, no. But there was 
one time, January 25, 1996  the 
Thursday before the Super Bowl  
that 111 never forget. I was backing 
up, and I fell over a television cam
era. They asked me if I was okay and 
I thought yes, but really, I couldnt 
move my arm. I had to have surgery. 
These things happen.
. IT: Arent you afraid of being 
tackled accidentally?
SR: There are seven of us out 
there, and the guy who is most 
vulnerable is the umpire because 
he lines up behind the defensive line. Im 
a linesman, and I am emphatic about 
safety. One of the pieces of advice I give 
[to the people holding the first-down 
markers] is to grab the sticks and run 
like hell when they see the play coming
toward them because Ill run them over 
trying to get to safety. Essentially, we 
are all elderly gentlemen who cant run 
as quickly as those young studs.
TT: What was the worst heckling you 
ever received?
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
Sanford Rivers can be found in Warner Hall during the 
week and on the field during the weekends.
SR: I dont get very much heckling. I 
did a game in New England where I was 
running toward the end zone, and I 
slipped and fell. As I got up, a fan who 
was unhappy with a call I had made 
poured a cup of beer on me. I was okay
with it, but it wasnt my brand.
TT: Have you ever had any trouble 
with a player?
SR: When I first started as an official, Id 
go home and ask my parents, As many 
times as Ive been called this name, were 
the two of you married when I was 
conceived? As an official, you get 
called everything. But if you realize 
its not you theyre heckling, its 
what you represent  youre okay 
with it.
TT: How long have you worked 
at CMU?
Si?: Do I have to tell? Since 1970. 
Actually, CMU has to be credited 
for my getting started as an offi
cial. I always thought of them as 
old men who couldnt get football 
out of their systems. I thought I 
was too young for that. But Earl 
Birdey, the retired director of in
tramural sports, thought Id make 
a good official. I took the test and 
started out doing things like 
midget football and such. As I got 
better, the kids got bigger, and 
now Im in the NFL.
TT: Do you sometimes find it 
difficult to juggle officiating and 
being an assistant VP?
SR: The thing that makes it dif
ficult is when football first starts 
in mid-July. From that point on, 
its a seven-day work week until 
football is over, because CMU is 
expecting me to put in a five-day 
work week, and then I have to officiate 
football all weekend.
TT: So youre glad when football sea
son is finished?
SR: Yeah. My last game of th is year 
was the NFC Championship game. Af
ter it was over, I smiled, I had a beer, and 
I thought, Now I can go back and play 
Bill Elliott (vice president for enrollment) and Paul Christiano (provost) in 
racquetball and kick their tails.
TT: Then why do you like officiating?
SR: You know, I played college foot
ball, I tried out for the NFL, and my 
brother, Jamie, played in the NFL for 
seven years  I know its a very difficult 
game. When you get hit, it hurts. But 
what I can do now [as an official] is pass 
down to kids that they can do something 
other than play professionally. They look 
at me in a different light because Im 
doing work at the University. People at 
the game look at me differently when I 
tell them I work [at CMU]  theyre 
like, Hey, he has a job!
TT: Do most officials have other jobs?
SR: About 85 percent of the guys are 
still working while officiating. Some of 
them are lawyers, there is a podiatrist, 
a banker. What you find is that the 
guys who are successful in their every
day lives end up being successful offi
cials in the NFL.
TT: Give me three nouns that explain 
why you are a good official as well as 
good assistant vice president of enroll
ment for CMU.
SR: Integrity, flexibility, and principle.
TT: What do you mean by principle?
SR: Im a man of principles. You said I 
could only use the nouns, so I shortened it.
TT: So if you had to choose one: being 
at the University or being on the field, 
which would it be?
SR: Id be here. Theres something 
about the environment. The people who 
we serve, i.e. the students, and those 
who serve  theres a closeness and 
appreciation of one another.

Tutoring enhances students lives
EAST END, from page LI
are also days where things have went 
perfect. It is those perfect days that 
make the whole program worth
while, said Goodrich.
Hillary Carey, a sophomore design 
major, was having a hard time work
ing with Antonio, one of her students. 
Carey would try to help Antonio out, 
but he continu
ally insisted that 
he did not need 
her help. Then 
one day, Antonio 
asked to talk with 
Carey on the 
phone. That con
versation broke 
the communica
tion barrier be
tween the two.
Now Antonio and 
Carey are the 
best of friends, 
and he does not 
want Carey to 
graduate in 2000.
Students like An
tonio have given 
Carey an enrich
ing experience.
Working with 
East End has 
given me a sense 
of purpose, said Carey. It is the best 
part of my week.
After a 10 to 15 minute drive, a team 
arrives at the school and begins to 
tutor. At the elementary and middle 
level, the tutors usually help students 
with reading and math. Most of the 
help at the secondary level is given for 
algebra. At the end of the week, the 
tutors hold an after-school program
where the students participate in con
structive and fun activities like karate, 
art, and Web page building.
In turn, the tutors are rewarded with 
affection and gratitude from their stu
dents, according to Scott Goodrich, a jun
ior economics major and director of the 
after-school program. Whether it is 
through words, actions, or thank-you
East End volunteers become friends as well as mentors to the
cards, the students have a deep apprecia
tion for their tutors.
When [the students] are ready to get 
out of gym and do homework with you, 
you know youre doing a great job, said 
senior industrial management major 
Zakarij Thomas, president of East End. 
We spend of a lot of time and energy 
planning the tutoring program, but the 
students make it all worthwhile.
Many people in East End enjoy being 
a member because it is also a lot of fun 
to work with the other CMU students 
in the group, accordingto several of the 
tutors. In addition to tutoring, Carey is 
in charge of member relations where 
she unites all tutors together through 
various social activities and luncheons.
Since [East End] is an outreach 
group, it is 
very easy to 
lose contact 
with the other 
members, 
said Goodrich. 
Despite this, 
the tutors of 
East End have 
become close 
friends who all 
share the same 
interest of 
helping others 
one-on-one.
The East 
End program 
is currently 
registering 
students for 
the spring se
mester tutor

basic math and reading skills, but 
patience, understanding, and commit

and safe. We are there to help them 
with problems they encounter, based on 
experiences we have had, to help them 
build a better robot, he said.
Last year, the Robotics Institute spon
sored a team from Schenley High School, 
and volunteers like Shillcutt helped the 
team place in the top half at the national 
FIRST competition. This is the first year 
they are working with Taylor Allderdice.
We wanted to give another high school 
a chance to participate in [the competi
tion], said Shillcutt. Its really good to 
see so many high school students in
volved and interested in engineering.
However, the efforts from Carnegie 
Mellon to help with the project are not 
solely those of graduate students from 
the Robotics Institute. We have a lot of 
eager students and teachers at the high 
school. They are all very enthusiastic, 
said Montemerlo.
Taylor Allderdice robotics teacher Joe 
Abraham has been heavily involved with 
the project. Abraham attended the 
FIRST workshop with Shillcutt and 
Montemerlo in January to learn the rules 
of this years contest and about the ma
terials allowed for the project.
Other graduate students from the Me
chanical Engineering and Civil Engineer
ing departments are helping with the 
team. Freshman Yatish Patel, an electri
cal and computer engineering major, is 
also one of the advisors volunteering time 
to help the high school students.
I was on a FIRST team last year with 
my high school. When I went to the na
tional competition, I saw that Carnegie 
Mellon was part of a team, so I decided to 
join it when I came here, he said.
Patel admits that it feels weird being 
on the other side of the project as an 
advisor rather than a student. Yet he also 
knows the perspective of the participants.
There is a lot of team spirit and a lot 
of enthusiasm when you go to the com
petitions, said Patel. Choosing to be on 
a team again was not a very hard deci
sion for me. Just getting to see what the 
competition is, and what kinds of ideas 
people can come up [with] makes it very 
interesting, he said.
According to Montemerlo, the compe
tition was designed to help students 
become as excited about engineering and 
science as they often are about sports.
According to Patel, the competition is 
a great way to experience what it is like 
to be part of a team solving a complex 
problem. It taught me the process pro
fessional engineers take when they have 
to design projects to meet certain goals, 
[and it] taught me a lot about time con
straints that are put on people when 
trying to design products, said Patel.
The competition also introduces the 
students to careers they may not have 
considered or known much about and 
gives them the opportunity to explore 
many areas such as the arts, design, and 
public relations. [The project requires] 
a big team with many efforts going on at 
the same time, said Montemerlo. It is 
as fun for me as it is for them.
The students will compete at the re
gional level in New Brunswick, N.J., 
March 19-21, and then at the national 
level, April 2-4, at Walt Disney Worlds 
EPCOT Center, in Orlando, Fla. The 
FIRST competition is sponsored by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA).
Look to tomorrow...Kids train for future 
architecture careers

Last week, we showed slides 
of landmarks and we designed 
monuments to their favorite 
foods, said Ward. Unfortunately, 
many of the children reported 
that their monuments to pizza 
and various other foods fell apart
You also have to take your time 
and look at what youre doing, 
said David Scott, who is another 
fifth-grade student at Montessori.
Rakela, Scott, and other stu
dents have been inspired by this 
program. I really want to be an

This past Saturday, students 
built monuments to a geometric 
form after viewing slides of vari
ous buildings such as CMUs Mar
garet Morrison Hall and the John 
F. Kennedy Library and Museum 
in Boston. Klehr asked the stu
dents to observe the various geo
metric shapes that made up the 
buildings on the slides. Then, the 
children built their own structures 
based on their observations. Some 
ofthe childrens creations included 
a bridge, a house, and a dome 
made out of straws.
We learned about structure 
and how you have to keep it 
strong and think it through,

Academy who is participating 
in the Architecture for Children 
program this semester. You

a dream of mine.
The Architecture for Children 
program not only allows archi
tecture students, during their five 
years at college, to have a variety 
of experiences with children, but 
it also proves to be very reward
ing personally.
Its fun to do stuff with archi
tecture [in the program] because I 
can be imaginative ... and kids 
come up with ideas that I never 
wouldhave thoughtof, saidKlehr.
The way I measure it is when 
the parents come to pick kids up 
and how excited they are when 
they talk about what theyve 
learned, said Ward.
Both Ward and Cross have ex
pressed an interest in teaching 
after they leave CMU.
Wherever I go, its something I 
always want to stay involved 
with, said Cross. Over the past 
five years its something Ive be
come very passionate about.
Commission looks into education costs
WASHINGTON (AP) - Afederal commission looking into the 
soaring price of a college educa
tion says the institutions them
selves must do a better job of 
holding down costs and explain
ing how they spend money.
Issuing its final report after 
five months on the job, the Na
tional Commission on the Cost 
of Higher Education also urged 
Wednesday that parents do a 
better job of saving for their 
childrens education.
The congressionally char
tered 11-member commission, 
made up largely of college presi
dents, chancellors and others 
from academia, said it could 
not give a single, clear reason 
why the price of a college edu
cation has skyrocketed in the 
last quarter-century. It noted 
that the increases have leveled 
off in the past three years.
However, the commission 
said that the institutions must 
become more efficient and costconscious on their own or risk
the unpalatable alternative of 
government intervention.
Higher education has a respon
sibility to make its cost and price 
structures ... easily understand
able to the public and its repre
sentatives, said the report to 
President Clinton and Congress.
It stressed that financial aid 
has offset much of the price of an 
education, but also said parents 
and students should start saving 
earlier for college.
Because a major beneficiary of 
a college education is the indi
vidual involved, those with a 
genuine commitment to their fu
ture rightfully shoulder part of 
the load, the report said. The 
long-term financial return on the 
investment far exceeds the price 
students and families play.
The commission was formed 
as a result of legislation origi
nating in the House Education 
and Workforce Committee to 
help Congress rewrite the laws 
governing federal aid to colleges 
and universities.
The commission did recom
mend some steps for Congress 
and the government to take, such 
as to expand existing financial 
aid  but with no specific amount 
given  monitor the new tuition 
tax credits to make sure they 
dont drive down other financial 
aid, and ease regulations. It also 
asked Congress to study making 
aid available to the growing num
ber of part-time students.
The report gave a number of 
likely reasons for the increase in 
tuition, including declines in state 
subsidies and rises in building,
administration and technology 
costs. It said there was little evi
dence that faculty costs, includ
ing tenure, had a role. Nor did 
federal student grants or loans, 
although it said the correlation 
between increased loans and tu
ition should be studied.
That conclusion contradicts 
assertions made by Rep. Bill 
Goodling(R-Pa.), chairman ofthe 
Education and Workforce Com
mittee, who has resisted student 
aid increases on grounds they 
would drive up costs. Goodling 
had no comment on the report.

Aliens do exist. At least they do in 
Hollywood, and Im not talking about 
the Born in East L.A. kind. TV shows 
and movies are full of aliens: of all shapes, 
sizes: and demeanors, from Predator to 
E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial.
Aliens landed in movie theaters with 
films like The Day the Earth Stood Still 
(1951) and War of the Worlds (1953). 
These first aliens were usually threats 
to the safety of the planet, and either 
offered the ultimatum, Join us or die, 
in the former, or just, Die, in the latter.
Often, these first invaders were meta
phors for communism.
Around this time, aliens made their 
appearance in television in the now fa
mous Lost in Space. Aliens were usually 
presented as a threat to the human 
crew: Danger, Will Robinson, danger!
In the the 50s and 60s, most televi
sion shows with aliens were similar to 
Lost in Space, in that, they took place in 
space and in the future. The most fa
mous show to come out of this era was 
Star Trek. It set a lot of the modern 
precedents for the movie and television 
aliens to come. The big difference was
All art this page James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Co-Editor
that the ship had an alien aboard, our 
boy Spock. During this time, aliens were 
real characters and not just threats.
In movieland, the next few decades 
saw the alien genre flourish, with scores 
of films being pumped out by every Joe 
with a camera. Unfortunately, a large 
majority of these films were the celluloid 
equivalent of toilet paper (see Plan 9 
from Outer Space (1958) and The Eye 
Creatures (1965)). Though painful to 
watch, this period of alien adolescence 
was crucial to the development of our 
current thrill-a-minute alien flicks.
Aliens could have been the domain of 
B-movie cheese if it werent for pioneer
ing films by directors like Stephen 
Spielberg and Ridley Scott. In 1977, the
alien movie industry got the shot in the 
arm it needed with Close Encounters of 
the Third Kind. This movie played down 
the overused aliens as an invadingtheme 
and played into the UFO-sighting trends 
of the time.
While Close Encounters tried to make 
aliens nicer guys, Alien (1979) made 
them far worse. The alien was a scut
tling, slimy, insectile, defmitely-not-nice 
killing machine. It produced a new wave 
of really mean aliens, from the nowfranchised Alien series to baddies in 
Predator and Independence Day.
Television was not nearly as creative 
as its movie counterparts during the alien 
rebirth. Shows like Buck Rogers and 
Battlestar Galactica were essentially
larger scale versions of the Star Trek 
formula. These shows expanded the for
mula, though, and created intricate hier
archies within the galaxy government.
E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) 
brought us the happy, friendly alien 
that not only warmed your heart, but 
also fixed the cut on your finger. Aliens 
were no longer just mysterious or evil, 
they could also be your pal. From here 
followed Cocoon, '^batteries not included, 
and others where the aliens brought joy 
to the pathetic earth creatures they met.
TV jumped on the cuddly alien band
wagon, giving us Mork and Mindy. As a 
comedy, it dealt with a woman in Colo
rado living with an alien The alien (Robin

You know what, Spice Girls? I like 
you. Youre not like the other people, 
here, in the trailer park... and thats just 
the problem.
Virgin Records is controlled by little 
green men  its the only possible expla
nation  the Martians have sent down 
voluptuous women to captivate us while 
they do their dirty work. The good news 
is the aliens have slipped up, because 
Spice World drops too many hints.
In case youve been in a padlocked box 
for the past year, the Spice Girls are an 
all-female British pop quintet (vocals 
and dancing only, please) whove brought 
a consumer-friendly face to sultry, 
spunky feminism and have just haphad no control over?
I first became aware of this on Friday 
night, at Spice Worlds premiere (al
though honestly, weve had our suspi
cions). After the rabid popularity of 
goofy pop conventions dating back to 
New Kids on the Block, and ALF, I fully 
expected to be about the only young-ish 
person in the theatre. Wrong. The the
ater was filled with a cross-section of 
society, including couples in their early 
twenties going on dates. The only thing 
more eerie was the audience cheering 
like all hell when the opening credits 
began rolling. It only got worse.
The movies premise is as follows: Lets 
follow the Spice Girls around on their 
daily routine as they prepare for their 
first live concert at Londons Royal Albert 
Hall. Yes, its that simple, the aliens are 
making it easy for us. So we get to see
51998 Columbia
Are they of this world? The Spice Girls cause some to suspect their true origins.
pened to sell nine million copies of their 
debut album in the process. Each of the 
five has a distinct personality and nick
name (Posh, Ginger, Sporty, Scary, and 
Bob,) and preach subversive ideas like 
Girl Power, women being able to enjoy 
sex, and lower gas prices via domestic 
drilling. How would the religious right 
allow this unless it was something they
plenty of jet-setting, club-hopping and 
skimpy outfits. The aliens also know 
what we want, apparently. .
I know what youre thinking  youre 
being paranoid, this has more to do with 
Hollywood pop culture conventions. Well, 
its what happens in the films many 
subplots where we catch on to this piece 
of Martian propaganda. In a series of
seemingly disconnected sequences, we 
are treated to spittle-spraying media 
lords, faux-artsy scenesters, and Holly
wood opportunists. The culture watch
dogs must be tearing at their leashes.
The Spices dont stop there, either. 
Ginger questions the Popes faithful
ness to the church, all the while champi
oning an unwed friend who is soon to be 
an unwed mother. The aliens are at
tempting to plant the seeds of dissent 
and rebellion in the minds of Americas 
pre-adolescent youth.
The allusions are not always so subtle, 
either. Former Kids in the Hall member 
Mark McKinney, who has played an 
alien in previous roles appears in the 
movie. The unwed mother gives birth to 
a baby on command, and the baby is 
born not only with spiked hair, but with 
no trace of umbilical cord! If these are 
not proof enough, consider that in one 
scene the band is visited by actual aliens 
who ask for autographs.
Well, if we have concluded that there 
is no intelligent life in our solar system, 
and the only satellite transmitting any 
type of information past that point con
tains a message created when the eldest 
Spice was supposedly five years old, 
how is it possible that they have infil
trated our culture unless they are not 
from this world?
I tried to review the film from a techni
cal standpoint, but it was near impos
sible. Much of the humor and situations 
are geared toward the same audience as 
Teen Beat magazine. However, there are 
moments of brilliance and biting satire 
 parodies of current events, movie ; 
spoofs, and sly references to adult jokes.;
Spice World is a euphemism for the 
aliens plan for Earths domination. The 
movie is insipid, yet at times too damn 
smart for its own good. At times its 
gooshy, yet sexy and absurd. Then again, 
it could be that the aliens have me under 
their control, because Im now of the 
opinion that Sporty Spice can abduct me 
and give me an anal probe anytime.

Tartan Diversions Editor
They are among us. There can be no 
doubt. Aliens are definitely present in 
pop culture. Whether they exist or not, 
now thats a different question.
Popular culture is entranced with this 
question of life off of our own planet. 
Television, movies, trends, and the 
Internet tell us this. Fictional encoun
ters with aliens happen incessantly, it 
seems  Alien 1, 2, 3, Independence 
Day, Men In Black, just to name a few. 
Butreal encounters? Some are convinced 
of them, and some brush these claims off 
as hoaxes. But throughout much of 20th 
century history, there have been real 
events which make us wonder, pique our 
interest, and keep the idea of aliens from 
slipping out of our cultures collective 
consciousness.
Tuesday July8,1947  Roswell, N.M.:
A large object crashes near the cattle 
ranch of Mac Brazel. The Army recovers 
the disc, and Mac Brazel, who first en
countered the wreckage is detained. 
Many witnesses come forward in the 
days that follow, and the military, in an 
attempt to cover up the events, suppos
edly tells them to conceal their knowl
edge. The story released offers the ex
planation that the flying craft was, in 
fact, a weather balloon.
A simple Internet search on the word 
Roswell produces over 30,000 re
sponses. The truth about the 
governments involvement in Roswell is 
widely disputed on many of these'sites, 
50 years after the incident.
1953  Sci-Fis beginnings:
War of the Worlds, directed by sci-fi 
guru George Pal, winsan Oscar for spe
cial effects. Based on H.G. Wells novel, 
the aliens are portrayed as dangerous 
and out to destroy humankind. This
story of deadly invaders from outer space 
has since become a classic, one which is 
considered to define the sci-fl genre.
Thursday, December 9,1965  UFO 
Crash, Kecksburg, Penn:
An object is reported to have crashed 
in rural Pennsylvania. A bright light, 
described as a fireball by witnesses, 
flashes across the sky. State Police 
secure the area, and the military labels 
the object a meteor.
Recently, a writer for OMNI disputed 
this crash, questioning whether or not 
the authorities conducted a Roswell-like 
cover-up.
Just for the record, Kecksburg is only 
around 45 miles from the CMU campus.
1966  The final frontier in 
television:
Star Trek premieres, opens the door to 
monumental changes in the realm of 
popular science fiction. Creator Gene 
Roddenberry pushes the limits of how to
depict aliens on television. By some
times portrayingthem as friendly, some
times as dangerous, the show gives new 
exposure to extra-terrestrial characters. 
Star Trek produced lifelong followers, 
and continues to gain popularity in re
runs. Countless spin-offs, movies, books, 
and conventions were spawned from Star 
Treks concepts.
July 20,1969  Walking on the moon: 
NASAs Apollo 11 mission lands Neil 
Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz 
Aldrin on this satellite. After a decade of 
orbiting and testing, American scien
tists are the first to send humans to the 
moon. The astronauts walked for about 
15 minutes, and the government is pretty 
sure that no aliens came back with them. 
1982  Friendly aliens:
The premiere of ET: The Extra-Terrestrial bringsa new kind of popularity to 
aliens. This movie combines viewerfriendly aliens with viewer-friendly child
actors Drew Barrymore and Henry Tho
mas. The story of neighborhood kids 
protecting a lost alien from the clutches 
of authority creates a new image of the 
government as a dangerous power.
March 31, 1997  New information 
for believers:
The establishment of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) allows any citi
zen to request records (from certain 
government agencies) that were previ
ously unavailable. Although the pro
cess of getting the information is com
plicated, the FOIA provides alien watch
ers with new material to delve into. It 
has allowed them the opportunity to 
try, once and for all, to find the truth 
about life in the universe.
Aliens do have a place in popular 
culture, and their popularity shows 
no sign of abating, as many of us still 
look to the sky for answers and hope 
for the future.

Century Fox
Horror flick depresses
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Staffwirter
The tag line on Phantoms advertise
ments is For centuries they told us 
the terror would come from above. 
Weve been looking the wrong way. 
The implication is that we should be 
looking down instead of up, but where 
we really should be looking is east, 
towards New York City and 375 Green
wich St., the home of Dimension Films.
The self-professed mainstream arm 
of Miramax Films has given us two of 
the most stupefyingly inane science 
fiction movies of this decade: the half-, 
witted Mimic and now the quarterwitted Phantoms. One wonders 
whether the studio should be called 
Dementia Films.
What: Phantoms 
Director: Joe Chappelle 
Company: Dimension Films
Phantoms is based on a novel by 
Dean Koontz, whose list of One-word 
titles reads like a second-grade dictio
nary: Darkfall, Hideaway, Intensity, 
Lightning, Midnight, Phantoms, Shat
tered, Strangers, Watchers, Whispers. 
Once youve read four or five Koontz 
novels, they all swirl together and be
come indistinguishable until all you 
remember is a jumble of predictability 
and anti-climax.
Which is all I remember from Phan
toms only minutes after seeing it. The 
story, in a nutshell, is that a big tape
worm that lives in the earth and sup
posedly wiped out civilizations hun
dreds of years ago has resurfaced and 
eaten the townspeople of Snowfleld, 
CA, population 400. The creature mag
nanimously decides to spare a handful
of dimwits: a local doctor (Joanna Go
ing), her younger sister (Rose 
McGowan), the town sheriff (Ben 
Affleck), and a wise old professor (Pe
ter OToole) who has, naturally, spent1 
his life studying the history and legend 
of this particular beast, known to its! 
acquaintances as The Ancient Enemy.!
The monster has quite an ego and' 
wants these survivors to tell the world' 
of its existence, which seems like an' 
odd request since its just going to eat 
the world sooner or later: While placat
ing it, our heroes try to figure out a way! 
to destroy it.
What makes Phantoms a great ex-! 
ample of how not to make a horror! 
movie is the fact that its suspense -i 
what little there is  comes not from 
situation or story, but from techniques 
of filmmaking. Dim, eerie lighting,! 
building music and quick cuts to blood' 
and gore tell us that were supposed to' 
feel scared.
But real suspense comes in Phan-l 
toms one clever scene, in which the! 
monster takes the form of a cute yellow! 
Labrador and watches Ben Affleck ag he: 
goes into a laboratory to retrieve samples' 
of a virus that will kill it. Affleck, like 
the audience, expects the dog to attack,' 
but it doesnt  it just watches. When it 
disapproves of the sheriffs actions, it 
growls and blocks his path, and we 
know the dog can kill him in an instant; 
if it wants to. Were waiting to see what 
happens, how our hero will get out of 
this situation.
But this one moment seems acciden
tal to Koontz, who wrote the screen
play, and director Joe Chappelle. These 
guys are more concerned with the quick 
thrill, the fast pay-off. Phantoms is like 
a premature ejaculation: fun for about 
half a second, but ultimately a depress
ing let-down for all parties involved.
Comedian uses low-key humor
Be Upwardly Mobile.
Screenplay fulfills writers Expectation
storys basic elements are the 
same: the poor boy falls in love 
with the rich, snob girl. And the 
film, unlike the typical romance 
nowadays, is as deep and unpre
dictable as Dickens characters. It 
is a moving drama which estab
lishes screenwriter Mitch Glazers 
ability. He adds richness with 
touches of humor.
The story follows the life of Finn 
Bell (Ethan Hawke), a poor but 
handsome artist who falls in love 
with Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow, 
Emma), Both actors seem to fit 
right into their roles: It is enjoy
able to see Hawke playing the 
compassionate lover, not bitter as 
in Reality Bites, but as cute and
innocent as in Dead Poets Society. 
Paltrow seems to play the snob all 
too well. The real show stealers 
are the smaller, though quite es
sential roles played by Robert 
DeNiro, who as always, possesses 
a dominating presence. Anne 
Bancroft, quite aged since The 
Graduate, is as enchanting as ever.
The script, perhaps not quite 
as elegant as Dickens book, is 
realistic and meaningful without 
being excessive. Where it lacks in 
elaboration, the cinematography 
overwhelms. Executed by 
Emmanuel Lubecki, it perfectly 
compliments the directors unique 
intentions. One picks up right 
away on Cuarons obsession with
the color green, but the earth 
tones along with the panoramic 
shots of nature create a timeless 
atmosphere, which is graced by 
the presence of the supposedly 
haunted house that was used as 
part of the set. In addition, every 
shot is done from an unprec
edented angle. Each image is a 
compositional masterpiece. In the 
film, you can admire the many 
pieces of artwork by Fransesco 
Clemente. But when you take a 
step back, the picture as a whole 
can be admired in the same way
 as a work of art.
It is definitely a picture that 
deserves to stand alone as an 
artistic accomplishment.

Visitors from TV-land
infiltrate our culture
Stacey Tetztaff/Tartan Photo Staff 
Norm MacDonald displayed his distinct style on Saturday night.
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Norm MacDonald is best known for 
his successful stint as anchor of Week
end Update on Saturday Night Live, 
where his dry wit and purposely offen
sive manner made the segment
 one of the most popular portions 
of the show. MacDonald brought
.. the same attitude and sense of
- the world that made his televi
sion appearances so well-received to Rangos Hall Saturday 
in an exceptional stand-up com. edy performance.
The show, sponsored by the Ac
tivities Board, began with come
dian Bill Scott as the opening act,
* to the dismay of the eager crowd.
. Scotts act consisted mostly of obacenity-filled jokes, which seemed 
 to involve the word ass about 
. ninety percent of the time. Scott 
seemed very concerned about try.. ing to win the audiences atten
tion, and included several jokes 
, about Hanson, gays, and drugs, 
which he hoped would help the 
, audience identify with him. The 
crowd found much of his material 
to be amusing, but his offensive 
.. jokes often lacked any purpose 
other than shocking the audience. 
Nevertheless, I think most people 
found Scott likable, and I think 
that perhaps with some sharper 
' writing he could be quite successful.
I think most peoples opinions of Scott 
may be cloudedhy the phenomenal show 
.ut on by Norm MacDonald. Not a 
}ininute went by during the show when 
MacDonald didnt elicit huge laughs 
ifrom the audience. His act was very 
I; simple in structure  he simply stood 
up front and talked about everyday
things in a conversational manner. 
What makes MacDonalds material so 
much more effective is how he uses his 
cocky manner to make obvious truths 
about the world and people seem hilari
ous. For example, when discussing 
alcohol, MacDonald simply stated, I
like to drink booze. His show was pep
pered with statements like that, things 
that people think but often dont come 
out and say. His explanations of the 
mechanisms of sex didnt tell the audi
ence anything they didnt know, but the 
fact that he came right out and said it as 
if it were some revelation made it very 
funny. MacDonalds honesty and au
dacity kept the audience in stitches the 
entire evening.
Another aspect ofMacDonald that made 
his act so enjoyable is his complete re
fusal to take anything seriously. His dis
cussion of fitness quickly degenerated 
into a series of wry observations such as, 
When they talk about 
buns of steel, theyre re
ally talking about an ass 
of steel. Similarly, 
MacDonald poked fun 
atsex, the Olympics, and 
a host of other topics dur
ing the show. Although 
his manner is meant to be 
offensive, his self-depre
cating style and obnox
ious grin make it impos
sible for someone to re
ally find meanness in him.
To include all of the 
highlights of the show, I 
would probably have to 
begin an entirely new 
publication. Even if I did 
that, it wouldnt be en
tertaining because 
MacDonalds talent isnt 
really based on fantastic 
jokes. Very few comedi
ans would be entertain
ing telling MacDonalds 
material, because 
itrevolves around his sar
casm-filled delivery and 
low-key manner. Its dif
ficult to convey just how funny 
MacDonald was, but a friend of mine put 
it best when he said, Sometimes I 
wanted to laugh harder, but I just 
couldnt. I think many of the members 
of the audience Saturday felt the same 
way and hope that someday MacDonald 
will return to CMU with another fantas
tic show.
side of the title and the basis of 
the story, this film bears little in 
common with the Dickens tale. 
With all the dissimilarities, the
INVADERS, from L9
Williams) not only came from 
an entirely different culture, 
he behaved like a freak.
After Mork and Mindy suc
ceeded, aliens were funny. And 
ALF proves it. Alf, aka Gordon 
Shumway, was adopted by a hu
man family after his ship crashed.
From there, alien movies 
went every which way but loose. 
There are the real life alien 
movies (Communion and Fire 
in the Sky) playing up the ab
duction tales put forth as truth. 
On TV, we have Unsolved Mys
teries, which was the first show
that dealt with the supposedly 
real alien stories. There haye 
been numerous copycat shows 
since, further fanning the flames 
of the alien craze.
The biggest alien crazed TV 
show currently on is TheX-files. 
The show goes one step beyond 
the Unsolved Mysteries formula. 
It takes those alien sighting sto
ries and approaches them as 
fictionalized FBI investigations. 
Add a healthy dose of govern
ment conspiracy, and youve got 
a hit TV show.
Aliens will never die in the 
movies, just get more creative. 
From the alien undead (Lifeforce) 
to furry supercriminals from 
outer spacejails (Critters) to alien 
clowns of death CKiller Klowns 
from Outer Space), aliens', are 
allowed every permutation. Men 
movies and TV shows cover al
most every movie genre, includ
ing drama (Contact) and comedy 
(Mars Attacks!).
Since the fall of the Soviet 
Union, the touchiness of Mid
east releations, and the factthat 
every human on earth has ah 
association to defend it when 
its depicted negitively, aliens 
are the only PC villain left. And 
we cant laugh at groups any
more, so the only PC group to 
laugh at is aliens, so we can 
doubtlessly expect more aliens 
to invade our homes and njov^e 
theaters and abduct our money.

U-Turn
Why did Oliver Stone decide to put a three second 
black-and-white shot in this movie? You cant tell 
me the guy ran out of color film. So whats the deal?
Anyway, its nice to see that some filmmakers are 
rich and powerful enough that they can slum it 
like people who have to buy a hundred feet of white 
leader instead of milk. Too bad that he didnt give all 
the money that he would have spent to someone who 
cant afford not to make crappy-looking movies.

Fast-paced play takes stab at Rage
ByALEXLEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The story of All The Rage is 
straight out of a Tarantino film, 
and the dialogue smacks of David 
Mamet. Hence, there isnt much 
originality in this new produc
tion at the Pittsburgh 
Public Theater.
The opening scene shows us a 
not-entirely-stable man named 
Warren standing over a body in a 
pool of blood. Warren clutches a 
gun, and his bathrobe is blood
stained. His wife Helen runs in, 
panicked, and Warren explains 
that he shot an intruder. As it 
happens, the intruder is Warrens 
business partner, who was, ac
cording to the paranoid Warren, 
one of Helens many lovers.
From here the story gets in
creasingly complicated as we meet 
a slew of characters. Helen runs 
away from Warren, masquerades 
as a man, and takes a job as secre
tary to a cranky old hermit. Her 
predecessor in the job, the 
squirrely Mr. Tennel, starts a 
new life as a clerk in a video store, 
where he meets a beautiful ado
lescent named Annabel Lee, who 
is, in turn, sleeping with a lawyer 
named Tim, who happens to be 
Warrens lawyer.
But wait, theres more! Tim is
also sleeping with a 
very depressed and 
lonely man named 
Chris, who helped 
Helen pick out a suit 
when she decided to 
become a man. A re
tired cop named Tyler 
is still trying to put 
Warren in jail for the 
murder of his 
(Warrens) partner. 
Tylers own partner, 
Agee, is after a kid 
named Sidney, who 
killed a man for ogling 
his little sister, the pre
cocious Annabel Lee.
Its all a bit 
confusing.
The play is made up 
of short scenes in 
which two or more of 
the characters find 
themselves in the

same place at the same time, and 
you always want to press some 
kind of pause button so you can 
take a minute to figure out who is 
connected to whom and how. All 
the characters have guns and 
every scene is tense because 
youre never sure whether some
one is about to get shot.
But that tension becomes hack
neyed as the play grows repeti
tive. Almost all the scenes are the
same length (six to eight minutes 
for the short-attention-span au
dience). And almost every scene 
contains clipped, fast-paced dia
logue like the following:
Should take him out in the 
alley, blow his head off, 
let him bleed.
Im with you.
I should do it.
Absolutely.
The majority of the actors seem
so concerned with keeping the 
pace of the dialogue going, like a 
steady, rhythmic ping-pong 
game, that they fail to listen to 
each other. Suddenly, the quick 
back-and-forth becomes too quick, 
and youre saying to yourself, 
People dont speak this way.
There are a couple of standouts, 
however, actors who listen and 
respond to the other actors and 
who feel utterly genuine as a re
sult. Careena Melia as Annabel 
and Christian Rummel as her 
brother Sidney are tremendous 
talents, too good for a play that 
exists only to create suspense, 
shock the audience, and make a 
trite statement about violence 
in America.
The playwright, Keith Reddin, 
condemns violence atthe same time 
that he indulges in it. His charac
ters bemoan the violent world they 
live in  This world is a cesspool 
of insanity full of sick fucks run

trying to make a statement about

efforts to shock the audience with 
bullets, Reddin proves that hes no 
better than the rest of us.

Pittsburgh Public Theater 
through February 22.
Art benefit provides distinct atmosphere
By JUSTIN CINA
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU Womens Center held 
a benefit art opening/concert fea
turing music, multi-media art, 
and new perspectives for those 
present. The Womens Center is 
an organization that provides a 
strong presence on the CMU cam
pus. Through this benefit, the 
Womens Center made this pres
ence known.
Whether they had come to intellectualize over the artwork, or 
bang their heads with the bands 
the attraction of the benefit was 
the intenseness created by the 
exhibits. In addition to the art
work, done by several CMU stu
dents, the mixture of different 
attendees was interesting enough 
for an entertaining evening, es
pecially when Campus Police shut 
the event down because of com
plaints of loud music.
At first, the order of events didnt 
add up to a promising evening. 
The earlier bands seemed more
like the seedlings of grungish de
light than one would expect to 
open the night. Specifically, Molly 
and the Regicides, these two 17- 
year-old girls on bass and guitar 
who didnt quite excite the crowd. 
Aside from the fact that they 
lacked a drummer, their tunes 
were unvaried and muffled.
Considering the aggressive na
ture of the music, one would have 
expected more energy. I had to 
resort to the artwork to brighten 
the evening. The art by itself, 
though, was enough to captivate 
its viewer.
The exhibit consisted of sculp
ture, painting, video, and photog
raphy. Two huge paintings by 
sophomore art major Emily Merz 
dominated the space. They were 
close-up paintings of two CMU 
students faces. The two women 
portrayed in Merzs paintings also 
had their own work up, including 
two mixed media pieces from 
sophomore art major Olivia 
Allison and a mixed media sculp
ture entitled Sex Box from junLisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Several local bands played at the Womens Center Saturday night.
ior art maj or Zoe Woodworth. Two 
paintings by Sophia Esterman, 
portraying a unknown woman in 
the nude, were painted in pleas
ing warms and cools, creating a 
captivating composition. Other 
works included sophomore BHA 
major Mary Tremontes Barbie 
Corset, a mobile constructed from 
headless barbie dolls.
Tracy Drash was, by far, the 
most entertaining of the perform
ers. almost resembled folk songs. 
Following Drash was The Sottile 
Crime Family.
At about 11:45, Campus Police 
had to break up the gig. They 
abruptly barged in on the Crime 
Familys music and mood, Flavor 
Station didnt even get to play. 
Its unfortunate that a few care
less complaints could disrupt such 
a constructive event.
The artwork exposed me to a 
slice of life I had previously not 
know. The presence of the 
Womens Center on campus is 
not widely known, and to be ex
posed to it for the first time was a 
positive experience.
Electronic EP shifts through classifications
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
One of the main stumbling 
blocks for new Curve listeners 
may be deciding how to describe 
the band to their friends. Granted, 
this is not an incredibly demoral
izing experience to deal with, such 
as conveying your love of polka 
techno to your nearest and dear
est and then having said person 
laugh in your face, but it remains 
a problem. Curves earlier fulllength albums, Doppleganger and 
Cuckoo, were described as any
thing from shoegazer to indus
trial to gothic, and their new EP, 
Chinese Burn, is sure to cause 
genre-classifiers plenty of headcourtesy Universal
Curves new EP provides a mix of different styles.
aches as well.
Chinese Burns eight tracks 
contain six mixes of the title track 
plus two non-album songs, Rob
bing Charity and Come Clean. 
This in itself is odd since the 
expected title of their next al
bum, due early this year, is Come 
Clean. The mixes vary from 
trance to dark jungle to every
thing in between and in the sur
rounding area, so perhaps the 
best description of the album is 
electronic.
Floods mix of Chinese Burn 
starts the album showing us what 
has happened to their sound in 
the four years since Cuckoo was 
released. The natural sound of 
the old drums has been replaced 
by bigger bass 
kicks, and, along 
the same lines, 
the swirly guitars 
have been by
passed for a more 
aggressive howl. 
The fast-moving 
track places Toni 
Hallidays vocals 
in the forefront 
and roughens 
them with a little 
distortion. Lyri
cally the song 
doesnt seem to 
make sense, but 
for me the words 
were never 
Curves strong 
point.
After this come 
a variety of mixes 
of Chinese Bum 
-without a doubt
the best being the Paul Van Dyk 
and Headcase ones. The first 
clocks in at over 10 minutes and 
builds as the track continues, al
ways changing and never going

Records
stale. The light beat and synth 
washes give way to a steady dance 
beat which proves to be alter
nately relaxing and moving. 
Throughout the piece vocals flit 
in and out of the tapestry and 
only complement the trancy feel.
The second - remixed by 
Curves own Dean Garcia, who 
with Halliday is Curves creative 
core-is quite different and seems 
to go nowhere during its six-orso-minute duration. Yet on closer 
inspection most of the original 
lyrics appear in the track and one 
cant argue that its quite catchy. 
One gets a sense of the coldness 
of machines listening to the hol
low vocals, something which the 
music only matches, as if it was 
being played in a room the size of 
a mansion and bouncing off the 
walls. All this is after a lengthy 
intro with a low drone, soft key
boards and what sounds like owl 
hoots - talk about scary.
Both the Lunatic Calm and 
Witchman remixes sound very 
similar with heavier guitars than 
the original, more menacing percussion, and grunts laced 
throughout. The Witchman 
seems to move around a bit more
and ends in a chaotic sonic stew 
where a lot of instruments make 
a lot of noise. Lunatic Calms ver
sion tries to change direction in 
the middle of the track by sud
denly dropping the drums and 
then ascending the musical scale, 
which might work if I hadnt 
heard it several times before. 
Neither remix is bad, but a little 
more difference in the grunts/ 
percussion might have helped.
Without commenting on the 
last remix - which sounds virtu
ally identical to Floods album 
version - Ill skip to the last two 
songs. Robbing Charity is defi
nitely the better of the two, being 
softer and slower than Chinese 
Bum and more in line with their 
earlier work. The vocals here are 
almost spoken, and the only thing 
other than the pulsing bass and 
hi hat cymbal is a low-key synth 
melody. Come Clean is a differ
ent story, a short electronic punk 
song with awful vocals that I hope 
is supposed to be a joke. I could 
achieve roughly the same sound 
by stepping on my friends cat 
repeatedly and banging on gar
bage can lids while recording all 
of it on a portable tape machine.
In short, what makes this disc 
worthwhile are Robbing Char
ity and a couple of mixes of Chi
nese Burn. The others by them
selves, while pleasant enough 
(except Come Clean), dont 
make the album worth getting 
unless you are a big Curve fan. So 
as a final judgment, if youre at 
all interested in the big umbrella 
of electronic music today, check 
out Curve.
